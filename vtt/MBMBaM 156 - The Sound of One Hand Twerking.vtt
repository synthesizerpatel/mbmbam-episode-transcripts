WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:48.560
Ladies and gentlemen, here we are, my brother, my brother, and me.

00:48.560 --> 00:52.480
We have made a replacement in the lineup, unprecedented.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.680
I'm still here. I'm still Justin McElroy, the oldest brother.

00:55.680 --> 01:00.000
I'm here also. I haven't changed. I'm the baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.240
But I'm new, baby. I'm Fat Pipes McElroy.

01:04.240 --> 01:05.440
Listen to that sound.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.760
Listen to the crispness. You can hear every bit and bite, every zero, every one.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.960
Travis, I feel your resonance right now.

01:12.960 --> 01:16.400
As well you should, Justin. I'm sending it to you through the fattest pipes.

01:16.400 --> 01:22.400
The basses are lower. The trebles are treble-er, treble-ier.

01:24.480 --> 01:29.600
Travis, you were previously on an internet that I was wondering if you could share the

01:29.600 --> 01:30.960
name of that with everybody.

01:30.960 --> 01:35.520
The name of that internet was Zoomtown, or as I like to call it, My First Internets.

01:37.120 --> 01:43.520
You finally decided to see your grandchildren had told you about email so much.

01:44.800 --> 01:50.160
Did the modem that came with Zoomtown look like an old, like, Nicktoons alarm clock?

01:51.200 --> 01:52.720
It was actually steam-powered.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.160
Okay. Did it look like it was made out of floam?

01:57.440 --> 01:57.840
It did.

01:57.840 --> 02:02.000
I wanted to share this with you guys before we got started in the show.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.920
I was just dipping in to check out our show notes into my email, and I got an email from

02:09.920 --> 02:15.840
Amazon alerting me that they had refunded me as part of a price matching.

02:15.840 --> 02:19.920
They had refunded me four cents on a game.

02:19.920 --> 02:26.080
And I just want to say, Amazon, if you're listening, you can just keep that in for a

02:26.080 --> 02:30.160
minute. Just have those four cents for Amazon.

02:30.160 --> 02:33.520
Amazon, you do a lot for us, and you can just have the four cents, Amazon.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.800
Just keep it next time.

02:34.800 --> 02:40.480
If someone came to me and said, Justin, I'll pay you four cents to read an email, any email,

02:40.480 --> 02:42.320
I would tell them to go fuck themselves.

02:42.320 --> 02:47.200
And now Amazon has an unwillingly foisted that transaction upon me.

02:47.760 --> 02:52.640
Just that they've fucking wasted that computer's precious database.

02:52.640 --> 02:56.080
That computer probably doesn't have the bandwidth of Fat Pipe's McElroy.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.040
You know what I mean?

02:57.040 --> 02:57.840
Who does?

02:57.840 --> 03:00.000
Justin, you've actually been offended on the wrong level.

03:00.720 --> 03:01.200
Why's that?

03:01.200 --> 03:04.880
The correct level to be offended on is that Amazon looked at all of your purchases and

03:04.880 --> 03:09.040
said, you know, Justin could probably really use this for something.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.080
Why don't they know?

03:10.080 --> 03:14.000
Don't they know how much money I spent there that I clearly don't need four cents?

03:15.360 --> 03:18.080
I'm ordering my kitty litter from Amazon.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.360
I think I can meet them halfway.

03:21.360 --> 03:21.920
I get it, though.

03:21.920 --> 03:22.960
That box is so heavy.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.640
You don't want to carry that around the Kroger's.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.360
No, you want to make the poor UPS guy do it.

03:27.360 --> 03:29.440
No, I like to see him struggle with it, actually.

03:29.440 --> 03:34.240
And then just as he's walking away, I open it and I'm like, my cat shit's in this.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.440
Sorry about your back.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.080
He's walking up all excited like somebody's getting a special package.

03:38.080 --> 03:38.640
Pretty heavy.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.080
What is this, some new Bose?

03:40.080 --> 03:41.280
Are these some new Bose speakers?

03:41.280 --> 03:42.400
Perhaps a home entertainment set?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.400
Oh, no, but it's cat poop dirt.

03:44.960 --> 03:48.560
Although I experienced that same thing when I'm like, whoa, what did daddy order?

03:48.560 --> 03:53.200
I don't remember, must have done some late night whiskey fueled Amazoning.

03:53.200 --> 03:53.920
Ah, damn it.

03:53.920 --> 03:54.720
How responsible.

03:55.280 --> 03:56.400
Happy Daddy's Day, by the way.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.680
Happy Daddy's Day.

03:57.680 --> 04:00.880
We should have started with that instead of Travis Fat Pies McElroy.

04:01.760 --> 04:05.680
That kind of information is brought to me quicker now because of the fat internets that I use.

04:05.680 --> 04:06.080
Yeah.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.440
Travis, while we were talking, Googled, what day is it?

04:10.880 --> 04:11.760
What day is it today?

04:11.760 --> 04:12.560
What day am today?

04:13.840 --> 04:14.480
Who am today?

04:14.480 --> 04:16.880
Happy Daddy's Day to the daddies in there.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.480
And of course, to our daddy.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.440
Do we have any more fun?

04:19.440 --> 04:23.280
Last Daddy's Day, we told the story of when dad cut his butt open and had to use a maxi

04:23.280 --> 04:24.640
pad as a makeshift bandage.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.200
I don't know that any story is better than that.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.680
I think we told the Freebasing kitty litter, too.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.840
Yeah, we told the Freebasing kitty litter.

04:31.840 --> 04:36.320
We told the story of when he was carrying a tray of lunch meat and got hit by a rear

04:36.320 --> 04:39.120
view mirror on the car that was passing by.

04:39.120 --> 04:42.960
And then he had to get driven by the hospital by this woman who was praying over the entire

04:42.960 --> 04:43.520
drive.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.320
Oh, man.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.120
I remember that one.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.320
A lot of fun.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.600
I told the story on Twitter today about the jawbreaker in the theater.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.800
You guys know that one.

04:50.800 --> 04:51.440
I don't think so.

04:51.440 --> 04:56.400
Where we were seeing a play with dad, and our dad used to be obsessed with these...

04:57.280 --> 04:58.880
They were bird's egg jawbreakers.

04:58.880 --> 04:59.600
Bird's egg.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.920
Sometimes I call them psychedelic jawbreakers.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.040
They're the white ones with the colorful flecks on them.

05:05.040 --> 05:10.400
That when you eat them enough, those flecks turn into like...

05:10.400 --> 05:11.600
They become tactile.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.920
They become like fucking burs.

05:13.920 --> 05:18.320
Yeah, it's like a topographical map of the earth.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.560
It's the worst thing to have in your mouth.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.120
I don't know why he was as obsessed with them as he was.

05:23.680 --> 05:27.120
They're why our daddy has diabetes now, but he loved them back in the day.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.000
He had a whole...

05:28.000 --> 05:29.280
You could get them at Cracker Barrel.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.560
It was like his exclusive dealer.

05:30.560 --> 05:36.320
And I remember he had an empty Shed Spread Country Crock container that he kept up out

05:36.320 --> 05:37.200
of our reach.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.160
Mac, you're back, huh?

05:38.720 --> 05:40.800
Wait till you see this new shit I got in.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.000
I've got the dopest, prickliest kush.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.320
But anyway, so he was enjoying some of his prickly kush.

05:48.960 --> 05:57.360
And he laughed, and the jawbreaker pops out of his mouth and rolls down two aisles.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.040
And without missing a beat, he says,

05:59.040 --> 06:00.160
Ah, my glass eye!

06:01.920 --> 06:04.960
And he covers the socket with his hand.

06:04.960 --> 06:09.600
And this woman, two aisles down, picks it up and hands it back to him.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.560
And he pops it right in his mouth, because he's a dirty creep.

06:12.560 --> 06:13.440
Our dad's a dirty creep.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.440
Our dad's a creepy, dirty fuck.

06:15.440 --> 06:15.920
Just kidding.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.600
He's the best dad of all time.

06:17.600 --> 06:22.480
If you say anything like that about my dad, I'll take your skin.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.320
Take your skin.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.120
Then it's ours.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.320
Hey, let's help some people.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.800
I recently moved to the city, and I've been on a number of dates.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.960
And expect to go on many more.

06:30.960 --> 06:31.520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:31.520 --> 06:32.560
All right, you have it.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.060
Okay.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.200
Maybe you should be advising us.

06:35.200 --> 06:35.920
My problem is this.

06:35.920 --> 06:39.440
I have what they say, what they might call a cool wiener.

06:46.080 --> 06:46.960
My problem is this.

06:46.960 --> 06:50.720
After a first date, I never know how and when to contact the female in question.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.880
Is the next day fair play?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.880
Should I wait a day or two and call?

06:54.880 --> 06:59.200
I've heard many opinions, but I would greatly appreciate the wisdom of the McElroy's.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.400
That's from Text in the City.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.000
It shouldn't be a problem, right?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.400
Like, the answer is never.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.760
You gotta wait for her to call you.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.680
And if she doesn't call you, then you didn't do it right.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.200
Did you drop enough negs?

07:11.200 --> 07:14.240
Did you wax your fedora before you went out?

07:16.080 --> 07:17.360
How was your fedora game?

07:17.360 --> 07:18.960
These are the important questions.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.240
Drop enough negs.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.880
Hey, everybody, if you're negging, quit it.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.200
Travis, you know this phenomenon, right?

07:25.200 --> 07:29.280
Negging is when you say something negative.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.120
I was able to infer that, Justin.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.400
Thank you, though, for breaking it down.

07:32.400 --> 07:36.240
Oh, man, I literally didn't make the connection until this precise podcasting moment.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.520
Oh, Jesus, Justin.

07:37.520 --> 07:37.760
Really?

07:37.760 --> 07:39.840
I had no idea what it stood for.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.160
I thought it had something to do with eggs.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.240
Okay, so wait, was this one of your leading, like,

07:44.240 --> 07:45.760
Travis, you know what this means, right?

07:45.760 --> 07:47.840
Because you wanted to find out what it meant.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.160
Yeah, I was kind of leading the younger people to help me.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.600
I mean, I figured it was like eggs.

07:51.600 --> 07:56.800
Like, you plant a seed and you plant it and then it hatches into love.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.800
Travis, you know what a vagina is, right?

07:58.800 --> 08:01.840
Travis, you've heard of a vagina.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.320
What do hugs feel like?

08:04.320 --> 08:07.680
This can't be a, this, that's not a science thing, right?

08:07.680 --> 08:09.920
Because I don't, if somebody ever came up to me and was like,

08:09.920 --> 08:12.560
hey, you have a big head and you're a little bit overweight in your gut area,

08:12.560 --> 08:16.000
I wouldn't be like, I'm, let's stick right now.

08:16.000 --> 08:16.640
So it's down, right?

08:16.640 --> 08:16.960
Gotta have it.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.760
Yeah, because you roll up and be like, oh, you wore that shirt tonight, huh?

08:19.760 --> 08:20.400
Okay.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.880
And like, the girl says to you, like, this is the one.

08:22.880 --> 08:23.680
Like, how does that work?

08:23.680 --> 08:24.720
Okay, anyways.

08:24.720 --> 08:30.080
If anybody, if like, I'm, if anybody is as self-conscious as I am

08:30.080 --> 08:34.000
whenever I'm in a social nighttime environment,

08:34.640 --> 08:37.360
like anything, like even, even what you said, Travis,

08:37.360 --> 08:39.680
if somebody came up to me and said, oh, that's the shirt you're wearing, huh?

08:39.680 --> 08:40.400
I would fucking leave.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.680
I'd get up and be like, oh, you're right.

08:41.680 --> 08:42.480
Bye.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.200
Ah, no.

08:44.240 --> 08:46.960
Is, is pause in a thing we could get going?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.320
Can we get pause in going?

08:48.320 --> 08:48.720
What's that?

08:48.720 --> 08:49.600
You just, you just,

08:49.600 --> 08:50.720
You mean compliments.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.160
Like complimenting the person.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.200
Complimenting people.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.960
That's good, but it's not like hip.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.120
I'm not going to sell a book called compliments.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.200
I might be able to sell a book called pause in.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.200
You could do it if like there was a Z on the end.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.840
If it was like compliments with Justin.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.480
Is that four Ns?

09:06.480 --> 09:07.600
It sounded like four Ns.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.360
Anyway, I really want to help this person.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.920
I think that, you know, the standard wisdom used to be waiting to call,

09:13.920 --> 09:17.120
but I think the nice thing is that with,

09:17.120 --> 09:19.440
we have so many different means of communication now

09:19.440 --> 09:22.400
that I think you can stair step back up to that.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.000
Like I think the next day.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.200
Justin, if I may interrupt.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.080
Well, this is a first?

09:28.080 --> 09:31.280
This is one step removed from that question

09:31.280 --> 09:34.560
because he's already been on a date with this person.

09:34.560 --> 09:37.360
This isn't like, I got a girl's number that I met at a bar.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.680
When do I call her to schedule a date?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.040
They've already gone on a date.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.880
There is so much FUD at play here, you guys.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.360
Like a fucking extraordinary amount of FUD.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.400
Cause you have no,

09:48.400 --> 09:50.640
if they don't give you a clear signal at the end of the first date,

09:50.640 --> 09:52.960
like I had a good time and we should do this again,

09:52.960 --> 09:54.960
who the fuck knows?

09:54.960 --> 09:58.640
They might've hated your guts and you don't know it

09:58.640 --> 10:02.720
until you send them a single word SMS message,

10:03.280 --> 10:05.680
lowercase H, hey, and that's it.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.680
And then they have to respond.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.360
The ball's in their court at that point.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.400
Here's the move.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.280
What you do is you order flowers the next day.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.320
That's pretty good.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.120
You order flowers, they show up at her office

10:17.120 --> 10:18.640
cause she's a working woman.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.960
You know, she's got her own priorities,

10:20.960 --> 10:23.280
but you order flowers, they show up,

10:23.280 --> 10:25.440
and on the card it just says, hey.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.320
All lowercase.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.040
Lowercase.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.760
Cause if you use that capital H, it's like saying, hey.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.360
And that sounds like something that a cousin

10:31.360 --> 10:33.760
would say to another cousin and they ain't gonna fuck.

10:33.760 --> 10:39.680
But if you do a lowercase H, it's like, hey.

10:40.720 --> 10:41.280
You know what I mean?

10:41.280 --> 10:43.280
It's like a heartbeat.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.240
What if you changed it to, oh, hey.

10:46.240 --> 10:50.720
Oh, like you just, like the flowers just noticed her?

10:50.720 --> 10:52.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.400
Can you use flowers for negging?

10:54.400 --> 10:55.440
Is that possible?

10:55.440 --> 10:56.560
Oh, you wore that shirt?

10:57.760 --> 11:00.480
The nose you're using to smell us is a bit off.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.920
Flowers need water to live, you fucking idiot.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.440
Put water in these, it'll die.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.040
Don't you know how flowers hurt?

11:07.040 --> 11:08.800
Everybody stop it with the negging.

11:08.800 --> 11:09.280
Stop it.

11:09.280 --> 11:15.040
So send flowers the next day and then I think that puts the ball,

11:15.040 --> 11:20.000
and this is not because it's a super romantic grandiose gesture.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.320
It just completely frees you from any sort of pressure

11:24.320 --> 11:26.400
as to how the situation will proceed.

11:26.400 --> 11:30.880
Because that is a pretty big Hail Mary putting the ball in her court.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.760
That's two sports in one metaphor.

11:33.760 --> 11:34.800
I'm retiring.

11:34.800 --> 11:39.040
You've got to be careful though.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.480
Because I understand the, or if you can establish yourself

11:42.480 --> 11:46.880
as the impossible romantic with like the fucking,

11:46.880 --> 11:50.560
if you can make yourself seem like a Joseph Gordon Levitt

11:51.360 --> 11:54.480
without crossing over to like,

11:54.480 --> 11:56.880
I only went on fucking one date with this dude

11:56.880 --> 11:58.720
and he's sending me flowers, I'm out.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.480
This guy's trying to make a suit out of me.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.400
Okay, so good rule of thumb there then is like,

12:04.400 --> 12:06.320
the showiness of the flowers is not the important thing.

12:06.320 --> 12:11.520
There's got to be a cactus, maybe like one flower.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.960
Do you have a succulents vendor nearby that you can-

12:16.080 --> 12:17.920
Oh, send her a fruit bouquet.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.240
Everybody loves the fruit,

12:20.240 --> 12:23.120
where they make them look like little flowers, but it's fruit.

12:23.120 --> 12:23.840
Don't do that.

12:23.840 --> 12:24.720
I hate that shit.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.480
People do that.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.600
They're not giving you a gift.

12:27.600 --> 12:28.880
They're giving you a project.

12:28.880 --> 12:31.040
Hey, guess what you're doing for the next two days?

12:31.040 --> 12:32.560
Did you guess eating fruit?

12:32.560 --> 12:33.600
Because that's it.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.320
That's what you do anyway.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.400
So what about the flowers that are made out of money?

12:36.400 --> 12:38.800
You send her a bouquet of money shaped into flowers.

12:38.800 --> 12:39.920
There's no way that could go wrong.

12:39.920 --> 12:40.640
That'll go well.

12:40.640 --> 12:43.360
Yeah, but people love money of all genders.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.280
A cookie bouquet?

12:46.320 --> 12:48.080
Okay, now you're getting closer.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.120
A giant cookie.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.360
Send her a giant cookie.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.280
Those are appropriate for every occasion.

12:53.280 --> 12:53.760
A birthday.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.360
Happy birthday, sport.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.960
Birthday, holiday.

12:57.680 --> 13:02.240
A bust of her made of cookie, crisp, cereal.

13:02.240 --> 13:06.560
Our friend Dwight says that he's gonna buy a giant cookie

13:06.560 --> 13:08.320
the day Hulk Hogan dies.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.080
So there's why.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.720
To celebrate outliving Hulk Hogan?

13:12.720 --> 13:13.680
I guess that's it.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.440
To celebrate the death of Hulk Hogan,

13:15.440 --> 13:17.360
he's gonna buy a giant cookie.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.680
There's a little bit of Highlander-esque schadenfreude

13:19.680 --> 13:20.640
happening there.

13:20.640 --> 13:21.280
Did I say that word right?

13:21.280 --> 13:22.480
He's been saying that for 10 years,

13:22.480 --> 13:24.160
and I can't stop thinking about how good.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.800
Every day I hope that that man dies

13:26.800 --> 13:28.160
just so I can get into that cookie.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.320
Because I can't buy one for myself.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.840
No, what excuse is there?

13:32.560 --> 13:34.800
Can you buy a giant cookie for yourself?

13:34.800 --> 13:36.160
If you buy a giant cookie for yourself,

13:36.160 --> 13:37.360
what do you write on it?

13:37.360 --> 13:37.760
Sorry?

13:37.760 --> 13:39.040
Yeah.

13:39.040 --> 13:39.840
Oh, here it goes.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.680
See, I think calling...

13:44.880 --> 13:46.400
I think if you call the day after,

13:47.760 --> 13:49.760
you're rid of the problem with every call

13:49.760 --> 13:53.600
where it's like you're presuming that you...

13:53.600 --> 13:55.760
You're sort of forcing her hand, I think.

13:55.760 --> 13:56.080
That's why you gotta send a text.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.080
I feel like with like a nice text,

13:58.080 --> 14:00.560
text, you can get a sense of what she thought.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.400
If she hasn't given you the feedback,

14:02.400 --> 14:03.440
ball is in your court.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.560
So you need to tell her like,

14:04.560 --> 14:10.480
I had a great time last night, when can we see each other again?

14:10.480 --> 14:12.720
But here's the thing, avoid this phrase.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.840
I just wanted to, don't do that.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.560
Well, no, we've talked about that before,

14:18.560 --> 14:19.840
how you shouldn't be like,

14:19.840 --> 14:23.440
hey, I know this is weird, like nobody likes that.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.000
I just wanted to say, I had a great time last night.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.200
No, be like...

14:27.200 --> 14:28.320
Hey, real quick.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.200
Hey, let me grab, can I grab your ear for a second?

14:31.200 --> 14:31.680
Let me just...

14:31.680 --> 14:36.160
So just say, so just like make it a statement of fact.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.520
I had a great time last night.

14:37.520 --> 14:38.560
I'd love to see you again.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.840
Not like wishy-washy, like, hey, if you're not busy,

14:41.840 --> 14:42.960
you know, if you had a good time,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.480
just say like, hey, a lot of fun last night.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.400
Would you be interested in doing it again sometime?

14:48.400 --> 14:50.320
You sound like a Hollywood power broker.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.680
Hey babe, hey, great time, great time syncing up.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.440
Great time, when can we sync up again?

14:56.080 --> 14:58.480
Good laughs, a lot of good fun.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.560
Great time, tag me on Facebook, hashtag great date.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.600
What do you think about the play

15:05.600 --> 15:07.440
of like trying to nail down the second date

15:07.440 --> 15:09.120
before the end of the first date?

15:11.440 --> 15:13.120
I was actually gonna suggest, Travis,

15:13.680 --> 15:16.480
that what you should do on any first date

15:16.480 --> 15:22.720
is try to borrow something, like try to borrow something.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.320
It's cold, can I borrow your jacket?

15:24.320 --> 15:25.040
It doesn't matter.

15:25.040 --> 15:28.960
The way this is gonna fit you, can I just try it on?

15:30.160 --> 15:32.320
It sounds like Travis is suggesting you sign like,

15:33.120 --> 15:34.880
you walk in the door to the restaurant

15:34.880 --> 15:36.240
where you're having your first date,

15:36.240 --> 15:38.400
and you say, all right, babe, here's the deal.

15:39.680 --> 15:42.640
I'm interested in signing you on a three date contract

15:42.640 --> 15:44.160
with a chance to renew.

15:44.960 --> 15:48.560
We'll have full binnies during the duration of the dates,

15:48.560 --> 15:55.040
by which I mean my business hog.

15:55.040 --> 15:59.360
Remember when we were talking about Coneheads during the date?

15:59.360 --> 16:02.480
No, I thought we did, but I would love to borrow that from you

16:02.480 --> 16:06.160
if you have that somewhere on Laserdisc or DVD.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.080
That's a risk because you have to guarantee

16:10.080 --> 16:11.600
it's something on her person,

16:11.600 --> 16:13.920
and I don't think this lady is carrying around

16:13.920 --> 16:16.080
a Coneheads DVD with her, and if she is,

16:16.080 --> 16:19.600
you have got to go, you have got to go right now.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.440
Stand up, collect your belongings, and go.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.760
It is kind of a power move, though, to say,

16:23.760 --> 16:24.960
can I borrow a Coneheads?

16:24.960 --> 16:26.480
And she goes, I don't have Coneheads with me,

16:26.480 --> 16:28.640
and you say, well, I'm happy to go back to your house

16:28.640 --> 16:29.360
with you and get it.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.400
And then you're just there, making out.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.560
You do it, and then the fucking-

16:36.560 --> 16:38.560
And then she says, I don't have Coneheads on DVD

16:38.560 --> 16:40.800
because no one does, and you say, are you sure?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.880
We should double check back at your place.

16:42.880 --> 16:43.520
And then the fucking-

16:43.520 --> 16:45.600
I'm happy to go to Best Buy and try to see if they have it

16:45.600 --> 16:49.120
in the 5.99 bin, and then maybe we can go home and watch it.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.480
And then say, nah, it wasn't that great.

16:50.480 --> 16:51.760
It's an overnight date.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.240
That's what Before Sunrise is about.

16:54.240 --> 16:54.560
Yeah, sure.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.160
Trying to find a copy of Coneheads.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.360
Yeah, in Vienna.

16:57.360 --> 16:58.800
It's like, oh, this is in German, too.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.320
Keep looking, keep looking, Celine.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.360
We'll find it.

17:01.360 --> 17:02.480
We'll find it eventually.

17:03.680 --> 17:04.960
You guys want Yahoo?

17:04.960 --> 17:05.280
Please.

17:05.840 --> 17:07.680
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

17:09.360 --> 17:10.080
Ira Ray!

17:10.720 --> 17:11.280
Who wants to know?

17:11.280 --> 17:13.280
Did you do that with a mouth of food?

17:13.280 --> 17:13.520
No.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.720
No?

17:14.720 --> 17:15.200
Justin.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.280
Thank you, Ira Ray.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Michelle, who asks,

17:20.640 --> 17:24.880
is it true that all cops have to start off on a bicycle?

17:26.080 --> 17:29.600
My brother told me that all cops have to start off as a bicycle cop.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.920
And do new cops have to wear a hat?

17:37.760 --> 17:39.040
I love that.

17:39.040 --> 17:43.600
Like your first week on the job, you're just walking around

17:43.600 --> 17:46.480
and then someone looks and your supervisor's like,

17:46.480 --> 17:48.560
listen, Daniels, you keep it up.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.080
You're going to get that Razor scooter.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.360
And then I'm just-

17:51.360 --> 17:52.080
That's what I'm saying.

17:52.080 --> 17:56.240
I think even starting with a bicycle is a little presumptuous.

17:56.240 --> 17:56.720
This makes sense.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.240
All cops start with Heelys.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.160
You can't just fucking walk into the precinct

18:00.160 --> 18:02.800
and get your fucking gold watch and your pension day one.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.920
You have to walk yourself up to that by busting some perps.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.960
If busting don't make you feel good, then you need to turn around

18:08.960 --> 18:10.640
and you need to take that Razor scooter

18:10.640 --> 18:11.840
and you need to scoot it on home.

18:12.320 --> 18:16.080
So you're saying after your first bust, you get Heelys.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.440
You start out with Heelys.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.720
You start off with Heelys.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.680
And then you get soaps and you can do some extreme walking.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.520
Congratulations, you busted your first perp.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.040
We're going to upgrade you to eight wheels

18:25.040 --> 18:26.400
and then you get some rollerblades.

18:26.400 --> 18:26.900
Cool.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.160
I'm sorry, what are soaps?

18:30.160 --> 18:32.800
Soaps are those shoes that had like the slippery bottoms

18:32.800 --> 18:35.360
so that you could like grind on paper.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.680
On benches and stuff with your shoes.

18:38.560 --> 18:39.440
Yeah, yeah.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.560
Nobody has ever done.

18:40.560 --> 18:41.120
Nobody's ever.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.240
That is what they sold it as.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.560
Like you can grind without wheels.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.720
And it's like you can look like a crazy person

18:46.720 --> 18:48.240
who doesn't know how stairs work.

18:51.760 --> 18:55.040
I think is where does horse mounted cops,

18:55.040 --> 18:55.680
where do they fit in?

18:55.680 --> 18:58.000
Because I think they are like the fucking king supreme.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.480
Yeah, that has to be like anyone who gets to touch a horse

19:02.480 --> 19:06.960
for a living has to be like the fucking leader of the pack.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.280
Well, they basically just made you like modern day,

19:09.280 --> 19:10.480
like Wyatt Earp.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.160
Like, hey, we're going to put you on a horse.

19:12.160 --> 19:15.120
You'll be the most intimidating person ever.

19:15.120 --> 19:15.600
Yeah.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.000
Because not only can the cop take you out,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
but the horse is also an officer.

19:21.920 --> 19:22.960
That's not a joke.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.680
Are you suggesting the horse has to be sworn in?

19:26.320 --> 19:27.200
Is that what you're saying?

19:27.200 --> 19:29.200
Now this is a great question because he's always

19:29.200 --> 19:33.680
going to say nay.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.120
The problem is true.

19:35.120 --> 19:37.360
And when the horse cop gets sworn in,

19:37.360 --> 19:39.280
the horse has to start on a bicycle.

19:39.280 --> 19:42.000
It's like a fucking ringling detective.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.200
But then at the end of it, you end up with a horse on a horse.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.840
And it's the most intimidating fucking thing.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.320
That's how you get the infinite leaning tower,

19:50.320 --> 19:52.640
the horse stack, the horse stack of justice.

19:52.640 --> 19:57.680
And it's just from the people who brought you stack soap.

19:57.680 --> 19:58.800
Stack horse.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.480
If you're listening at home, pretend

20:00.480 --> 20:02.240
when we were talking about oaths,

20:02.240 --> 20:05.520
that I said they trick them by saying that they

20:05.520 --> 20:06.960
are going to give them oaths.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.320
Man, I could have just dropped that in.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.320
Yeah, well, you can edit it.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.360
I think if I were a cop, the cops that I would always

20:15.360 --> 20:18.320
be most jealous of is the cops that they send out

20:18.320 --> 20:21.920
to kind of like sit next to where they are doing street

20:21.920 --> 20:24.720
construction because those cops are always just

20:24.720 --> 20:26.720
like in their car on their iPads.

20:26.720 --> 20:27.680
Just chilling.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.200
I saw one of those cops last night.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.240
That exact thought occurred to me.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.480
His laptop was turned away from the crowd.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.800
And it's like, you know he's streaming Veronica Mars.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.400
Like, no question about it.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.120
I may have been in a cop car chase yesterday

20:39.760 --> 20:42.560
because I was at the airport and I picked up Rachel's car

20:42.560 --> 20:44.320
there and I don't know how to drive that thing

20:44.320 --> 20:45.760
because it's not my precious Matrix.

20:46.320 --> 20:50.000
And it was in long term parking and I got kind of lost.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.360
And I tried to go out like one of the service exit gates

20:53.360 --> 20:55.600
quite forcefully and it didn't pan out.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.000
And then on the other side of the gate, like the cop

20:58.000 --> 21:00.080
turned on his lights and started coming my way.

21:00.080 --> 21:04.560
And I turned heels and I drove a little bit quicker.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.000
I drove a little bit quicker and I made it out

21:06.000 --> 21:07.040
of the parking lot OK.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.240
But it's troubling that I didn't think I should just

21:10.240 --> 21:12.240
sit here and let this cop take me.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.880
And like I need an adult and this adult is going

21:14.880 --> 21:16.000
to fix things for me.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.640
My instinct was like full blown Grand Theft Auto.

21:18.640 --> 21:19.680
You got a wild streak.

21:19.680 --> 21:20.480
I like that about you.

21:20.480 --> 21:20.880
I do.

21:20.880 --> 21:21.760
It was also 2 a.m.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.040
And man, I was a sleepy bear.

21:23.040 --> 21:26.400
I get I turned into a fucking aggressive driver

21:26.400 --> 21:27.760
when I'm a sleepy bear.

21:27.760 --> 21:30.160
I think I don't know if there's any truth to this.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.640
All the cops I know personally.

21:32.640 --> 21:33.840
Here's what's weird about cops.

21:33.840 --> 21:34.880
Let me tell you guys about cops.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.240
Please do.

21:36.240 --> 21:40.000
All the people that I know that turned into cops

21:40.800 --> 21:43.440
are like some of the fucking most solid dudes.

21:44.320 --> 21:44.880
Right.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.840
But the people I don't know that are cops are bad

21:47.840 --> 21:48.720
across the board.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.960
I've never had a good run in with a cop I didn't know

21:50.960 --> 21:54.480
that was like that felt like a good equitable exchange

21:54.480 --> 21:56.640
I just had with that municipal officer.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.760
It was like, man, that dude's really getting off on it.

22:00.480 --> 22:01.360
This is what I want to say.

22:01.360 --> 22:04.160
First of all, James Gowdy, you're a cop and you're awesome.

22:04.160 --> 22:04.720
You're doing great.

22:04.720 --> 22:05.440
That's what I'm saying.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.560
I know him and he's fucking doing the Lord's work over there.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.760
This is what I came to realize in pretty much every

22:11.760 --> 22:14.000
like service profession like that.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.680
I look at, for example, somebody working the counter at an airline

22:17.680 --> 22:19.360
and they're always a little bit gruff to me.

22:19.360 --> 22:20.800
And I'm like, but I'm a really nice guy.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.240
Why are they being gruff to me?

22:22.240 --> 22:26.960
And then I think about the 999,999 other people that are

22:26.960 --> 22:28.960
dicks to them on a regular basis.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.920
Now, take that and multiply it times 100.

22:31.920 --> 22:34.480
And that's what it must be like to be a police officer.

22:34.480 --> 22:37.760
When somebody is gruff to a cop, they are high on meth

22:37.760 --> 22:39.600
and try and bite them on the face and neck.

22:39.600 --> 22:43.040
It's like, excuse me, sir.

22:43.040 --> 22:46.000
You're being kind of rude by trying to chew my fucking face

22:46.000 --> 22:47.520
off because I'm a Florida cop.

22:47.520 --> 22:50.320
So the idea of like a cop kind of gives me a mean look

22:50.320 --> 22:51.840
and I didn't do anything.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.000
I'm like, you know, he's probably earned that.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.160
He's probably seen some shit.

22:56.160 --> 23:00.160
I'm such a broken person deep down in my heart that whenever

23:00.160 --> 23:06.800
I get into an altercation with a police officer or anybody

23:06.800 --> 23:08.880
with a badge, really, and when I say altercation,

23:08.880 --> 23:10.080
I mean like looking at me.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.120
I want them to walk away from the experience.

23:13.120 --> 23:16.400
The only thing I care about is I want them to walk away

23:16.400 --> 23:18.800
from the experience thinking, that isn't all right, dude.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.400
You know, we're on different sides.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.000
He's reaffirmed my faith in humanity.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.520
We're on different sides of the law, but I got,

23:25.520 --> 23:31.280
when I was at E3 last week, I had the wrong badge holder

23:31.280 --> 23:33.520
for my badge because I was trying to get on the show floor

23:33.520 --> 23:36.640
and the security guard was very mean and he took away

23:36.640 --> 23:39.760
my badge holder because he said I was using it improperly

23:39.760 --> 23:42.480
and he took it back to his office and it literally like,

23:42.480 --> 23:44.000
first off, it shattered my day.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.520
I was like completely out of it.

23:47.520 --> 23:50.160
The next day, I saw him in the security office

23:50.160 --> 23:52.800
and the thought occurred to me that I should go in

23:52.800 --> 23:55.200
and apologize to try to win him back over.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.960
You fucking dummy.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.200
I didn't do it, but that's what I thought.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.200
I was like, well, there's this person on earth.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.840
I'm sorry I put the paper thing in the wrong plastic thing.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.600
You gotta go in there and slam open the door and say,

24:05.600 --> 24:08.480
you're a loose cannon, Franklin, even if that's not his name.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.120
I was like, I'm sick of you crossing the line.

24:11.120 --> 24:13.040
Give me your gun and badge and get out of here.

24:13.040 --> 24:15.680
And he'll be so flustered, but it's exactly what he's always

24:15.680 --> 24:17.280
dreamed of happening that he'll do it.

24:17.280 --> 24:20.000
I get very deferent in situations like this,

24:21.200 --> 24:23.440
even for the most minor infraction,

24:23.440 --> 24:25.360
which is really all that I can really pull off.

24:26.320 --> 24:29.600
Because like in that moment, I'm a perp.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.640
In that moment where like my fucking,

24:34.640 --> 24:38.640
my matrix is sitting outside hasn't been inspected annually

24:38.640 --> 24:40.640
as Texas does require.

24:40.640 --> 24:43.360
It hasn't, it's been expired since like March.

24:43.360 --> 24:45.760
And I'm sitting here like with a fucking knot in my tummy

24:45.760 --> 24:47.760
because I'm a perp right now, guys.

24:47.760 --> 24:49.520
I'm a perp, I did a crime.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.920
Well, my car got towed away because my registration

24:51.920 --> 24:53.680
was expired by two years.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.040
Okay, that's pretty bad.

24:55.040 --> 24:56.160
I know, I'm a rebel.

24:57.280 --> 24:59.280
You guys don't even have inspections, right?

24:59.280 --> 25:00.880
No, it's not inspection, just registration.

25:00.880 --> 25:04.000
I just couldn't be bothered to go down to the courthouse

25:04.000 --> 25:04.640
and take care of it.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.520
Deuter comes up and he's writing my ticket and I go out

25:07.520 --> 25:08.800
and I'm talking to him and I'm like,

25:08.800 --> 25:10.320
okay, so I'll get it taken care of.

25:10.320 --> 25:11.520
And he's like, yeah, you should do that.

25:11.520 --> 25:12.240
It's been two years.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.600
And I was like, okay, great, thanks.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.440
But then he's back 10 minutes later,

25:15.440 --> 25:16.960
having the car towed away.

25:16.960 --> 25:17.760
Yeah, oh God.

25:17.760 --> 25:21.360
And I was like, I said, please don't tow my car away, sir.

25:21.360 --> 25:24.160
He beat off to that so hard that night.

25:24.160 --> 25:28.160
I'm telling you, I'm not saying it's all cops

25:28.160 --> 25:29.840
because they're doing a fucking dangerous job.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.240
I would never ever do that.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.840
But there are some cops that are like,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.080
I know you got here right as your meter expired,

25:38.080 --> 25:39.280
but I got to give you this ticket

25:39.280 --> 25:41.520
so I can have something to jerk off to tonight

25:41.520 --> 25:44.560
because God knows my wife's not going to do it for me.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.040
I know that's not true because his response was great

25:47.040 --> 25:48.880
when I said, please don't tow my car away.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.080
And he said, I mean, I would love to not do that,

25:52.080 --> 25:54.480
but it's been two years.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.040
Yeah, you were.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.240
I was like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.400
I've been out at which where I went, yeah, you're right.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.320
I just went inside and waited for it to be towed away.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.360
Yeah, did you look away?

26:01.360 --> 26:02.080
Did you watch it?

26:02.080 --> 26:04.080
I couldn't fucking possibly watch.

26:04.080 --> 26:04.560
No, I couldn't.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.160
I'm always terrified when someone tows my car.

26:06.160 --> 26:08.480
The perp guilt would like fucking strangle me.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.120
Let's help somebody else.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.840
I'm a 16 year old girl who had waist length,

26:13.840 --> 26:16.400
extremely curly hair until recently

26:16.400 --> 26:18.480
when I got five inches cut off.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.280
Even with the new do, I'm not satisfied with my hair.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.720
I want to cut it short in a boyish, not unlike Morrissey cut.

26:24.720 --> 26:27.440
I'm going to take a quick time out here and submit that.

26:27.440 --> 26:30.160
I think this problem, this person may be asking

26:30.160 --> 26:31.440
the wrong people about this,

26:31.440 --> 26:33.440
no matter what the question ends up being,

26:33.440 --> 26:35.120
but I'm just going to keep going with it, okay?

26:35.120 --> 26:36.560
No, women's style advice.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.920
Yeah, women's style advice, perfect.

26:37.920 --> 26:38.720
You've come to the right place.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.080
However, if I do this,

26:40.080 --> 26:41.600
I will probably give my parents heart attacks.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.000
I do not like the way I look,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.240
and I won't have any serious consequences if I get it cut.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.840
On the other hand, I will seriously

26:47.840 --> 26:49.440
disappoint my parents and feel guilty.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.720
What do I do, brothers?

26:50.720 --> 26:53.680
Cut my hair and feel guilty or suffer through the summer heat

26:53.680 --> 26:57.200
with my mess of curls as from contemplating on Cape Cod.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.320
Are your parents extremely religious

27:00.320 --> 27:02.480
and think like you'll lose your super strength if you get it?

27:02.480 --> 27:04.560
Like, what the fuck are your parents' problems?

27:04.560 --> 27:05.680
It's your fucking hair.

27:06.640 --> 27:09.840
They lost the right to it when you were a kid.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.000
When you emerge from the womb.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.520
Now, I don't know your parents contemplating,

27:15.520 --> 27:17.920
but it seems to me like if you said,

27:17.920 --> 27:20.960
hey, I'm thinking of cutting most of my hair off,

27:20.960 --> 27:22.320
and then when you did it,

27:22.320 --> 27:24.160
they probably wouldn't have a heart attack

27:24.160 --> 27:26.720
because they're like, well, she did say it.

27:26.720 --> 27:28.080
She did say it was going to happen.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.040
She warned us, you know?

27:29.040 --> 27:30.080
She did warn us.

27:30.080 --> 27:33.440
Contemplating, I was 16 once, hard as that may be for me.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.120
And he had waist-length curly hair.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.880
I had beautiful waist, no.

27:36.880 --> 27:40.480
So, I was 16 once, and I'm gonna go ahead

27:40.480 --> 27:42.960
and let you in on this now.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.640
You're gonna be disappointing your parents a lot

27:46.640 --> 27:47.680
over the next decade.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.240
This seems like a really nice...

27:50.880 --> 27:55.520
A slow ramp up to the constant disappointment.

27:55.520 --> 27:58.560
Yeah, a nice sort of palette cleanser

27:58.560 --> 28:00.720
for all the disappointment you're gonna be bringing

28:00.720 --> 28:01.920
onto them over the next decade.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.920
Why not go ahead and start small?

28:03.920 --> 28:05.360
Learn how to deal with it.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.520
Start practicing disappointment now

28:07.520 --> 28:09.200
with something this inconsequential

28:09.200 --> 28:13.040
so you can really ramp up to the drug addiction

28:13.040 --> 28:14.640
and the breaking and entering charges.

28:14.640 --> 28:18.080
You could also do the sort of switcheroo

28:18.080 --> 28:20.400
where you ask for 100 bucks and they're like, no.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.160
And then you say, well, how about five?

28:22.160 --> 28:23.680
You gotta give them the bad

28:23.680 --> 28:25.040
and then they won't worry about your hair.

28:25.040 --> 28:28.320
So, maybe you do get super into whippets.

28:28.320 --> 28:29.120
And you just do...

28:30.560 --> 28:32.560
Talking to them, you're driving home from church,

28:32.560 --> 28:33.680
like, where do you wanna go today?

28:33.680 --> 28:34.480
Applebee's?

28:34.480 --> 28:35.840
Yeah, Applebee's is, oh, hold on.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.360
And you do that whippet right in the fucking,

28:39.360 --> 28:41.040
right in the back of the grand caravan.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.560
And then you're like, oh, Applebee's, yeah, sounds great.

28:44.560 --> 28:45.920
And then they're like, what the fuck?

28:45.920 --> 28:47.360
And then they look back, your hair is short.

28:47.360 --> 28:48.480
And they're like, we don't care about the hair.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.520
Let's talk about these whippets.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.240
Then you quit, you quit your whippet.

28:52.240 --> 28:54.400
Then you quit, that's the only whippet you ever do.

28:54.960 --> 28:55.920
And then you write a book.

28:55.920 --> 28:58.800
It's gonna feel great, that whippet and the hair.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.000
I would also say that if at 16

29:02.000 --> 29:03.920
you cut off your waist-length hair,

29:03.920 --> 29:07.440
your hair will never be that long again, ever, ever.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.200
Wow, is that true?

29:09.200 --> 29:10.240
Well, because you gotta think about it.

29:10.240 --> 29:13.040
Like, half an inch a month tops, right?

29:13.680 --> 29:15.600
So if you're growing it down to your waist,

29:15.600 --> 29:19.680
that's like two and a half feet, you know, three feet.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.400
Waist-length, though.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.320
Oh, I solved it, solved it.

29:24.320 --> 29:25.600
Don't worry, guys, I solved it.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.760
Cut a quarter inch every day.

29:29.760 --> 29:30.080
Uh-huh.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.360
Oh, you wanna gaslight your parents.

29:33.360 --> 29:36.640
Exactly, you're gaslighting them.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.560
They're never gonna, they'll never know.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.960
And also, make your dad's clothes

29:40.960 --> 29:42.480
smaller and smaller every day

29:42.480 --> 29:45.040
so he thinks that he's growing and your hair is shrinking.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.000
I'm trying to focus on your hair,

29:48.000 --> 29:51.600
but the collar on my Tommy Hilfiger polo is so tight

29:51.600 --> 29:52.880
and I don't know why.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.880
Am I getting fat neck in my late years?

29:54.880 --> 29:55.760
And if they ask what's up, just be like-

29:55.760 --> 29:57.520
Rotate your mother's living room furniture

29:57.520 --> 29:58.880
one quarter inch a day

29:59.600 --> 30:01.680
until eventually the room is southward facing.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.360
If they ask what's up, just say that the universe

30:03.360 --> 30:04.720
is constantly expanding.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.320
And they'll be like, why does that have,

30:06.320 --> 30:07.920
why isn't my hair getting shorter?

30:07.920 --> 30:09.040
And you'll be like, I guess you're not as,

30:09.040 --> 30:10.480
I guess you're not as keyed in as I am

30:11.280 --> 30:12.880
to the universe's ways.

30:12.880 --> 30:13.920
You could also cut off your hair

30:13.920 --> 30:15.920
and then donate it to like Locks of Love or something.

30:15.920 --> 30:17.040
And then when your parents are like,

30:17.040 --> 30:18.160
you cut off all your hair.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.040
And they're like, yeah.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.640
And I gave it to people who needed it more.

30:20.640 --> 30:23.200
That's good, Trav, I like that a lot.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.120
Why don't you take on an industrial job,

30:25.120 --> 30:28.000
like in a factory or a workshop or a workhouse,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.320
and then they're like, hey,

30:30.320 --> 30:32.240
contemplate it, why don't you cut your hair?

30:32.240 --> 30:33.040
And be like, oh, I don't know,

30:33.040 --> 30:35.120
maybe because I didn't want my fucking head

30:35.120 --> 30:38.400
to get pulled into some sort of contraption, mommy.

30:41.360 --> 30:42.400
It's a serious concern.

30:42.400 --> 30:43.520
It is a serious concern.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.720
That's why Morrissey cut his hair.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.080
Morrissey was working in a sweatshop.

30:47.120 --> 30:47.520
And that's why his songs-

30:47.520 --> 30:49.120
They told him he was making enough money

30:49.120 --> 30:50.000
that he didn't have to,

30:50.000 --> 30:51.840
but he just wouldn't listen.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.520
I meant like as a kid, that's how he got,

30:53.520 --> 30:55.760
that's what most of his sad songs are about.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.400
Sweatshop Blues, for one.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.760
Where'd all my hair go?

30:59.760 --> 31:00.560
It's a good one.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.000
Moon River.

31:04.720 --> 31:08.240
Farm wisdom, farm wisdom,

31:08.720 --> 31:11.760
coming straight from the farm, it's farm wisdom.

31:11.760 --> 31:15.280
It's farm wisdom, farm wisdom.

31:15.280 --> 31:18.480
Travis McElroy presents Farm Wisdom.

31:19.360 --> 31:22.400
So this next Farm Wisdom comes from Mike Asbury,

31:23.040 --> 31:23.520
who says-

31:23.520 --> 31:26.000
It's not possibly, it's not,

31:26.000 --> 31:28.560
it's not, that's not a hundred percent,

31:28.560 --> 31:30.800
definitely not how his last name is pronounced.

31:30.800 --> 31:31.760
How do you pronounce it?

31:31.760 --> 31:32.480
Asbury.

31:33.280 --> 31:34.240
There's a T in there.

31:36.240 --> 31:38.560
It's from Mike A, Mike A.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.240
But you said Asbury.

31:40.240 --> 31:41.440
I said ass to Barry.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.880
I'm almost certain you said Asbury.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.240
Travis, farm wisdom.

31:46.880 --> 31:48.480
I don't know if this counts as farm wisdom because-

31:48.480 --> 31:51.280
Farm wisdom, Asbury's are delicious and great for you.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.480
Because I live in downtown Toronto,

31:54.480 --> 31:57.520
but I did grow up in the country and that is where my heart still lives.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.440
I guess these are more garden wisdom.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.520
To keep cats from using your garden as a litter box,

32:03.520 --> 32:05.760
put fresh citrus peelings in the soil.

32:05.760 --> 32:08.000
Oh God, that's fucking so,

32:08.000 --> 32:11.280
we caught Cecil fucking in Rachel's herb garden,

32:11.280 --> 32:14.400
which is arguably the worst kind of garden your cat can poop in,

32:14.400 --> 32:16.480
just like hovering over the cilantro.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.800
And he had a look on his face like, yep.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.440
This is, he like turned, he turned his body to face,

32:21.440 --> 32:23.680
we were having a barbecue and he turned his body to like face

32:23.680 --> 32:26.640
all of our friends who were drinking mojitos with the mint in it.

32:26.640 --> 32:27.920
Like, yep.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.360
Guess what?

32:29.360 --> 32:29.680
You like-

32:29.680 --> 32:30.480
Get out of my house.

32:30.480 --> 32:31.520
You like those mojitos?

32:31.520 --> 32:32.720
You like that crushed mint inside?

32:32.720 --> 32:33.840
Guess what else is crushed?

32:34.720 --> 32:35.920
My butt on top of this mint.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.480
We planted a lot of different herbs this year.

32:39.280 --> 32:42.720
And there, we have a lot of neighborhood cats.

32:43.280 --> 32:46.640
Guess which herb we planted did not pan out so well?

32:47.440 --> 32:47.840
Catnip.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.240
Weed.

32:48.240 --> 32:50.880
Catnip did not go so hot.

32:50.880 --> 32:54.000
That one got kind of, it is gone.

32:54.000 --> 32:54.880
It's completely-

32:54.880 --> 32:55.840
Got a little dicey.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.200
Got a little, yeah.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.080
Here's a similar tip.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.800
Plant some lavender, because when cats eat lavender,

33:00.800 --> 33:02.640
they fucking poop their brains out.

33:04.560 --> 33:08.400
That's more of a punitive measure than a precautionary one,

33:08.400 --> 33:10.800
but it'll fucking give that cat what for.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.400
Of course, it doesn't help much-

33:12.400 --> 33:15.200
Plant the lavender and the catnip in the same field.

33:15.200 --> 33:19.920
Doesn't help much if your cat exclusively poops in your herb garden,

33:19.920 --> 33:21.040
because then it's just,

33:21.040 --> 33:24.000
you're just changing the consistency of the ruination.

33:24.560 --> 33:27.680
Mike also says that begonias are not only bright and nice to look at,

33:27.680 --> 33:30.240
their petals can be used as a substitute for lemon.

33:30.240 --> 33:30.720
All right.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.240
Oh, that's a good one.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.600
Now, is it?

33:34.240 --> 33:34.640
No.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.960
I mean, I would have a much-

33:38.800 --> 33:44.720
I don't think there's a high probability of me not having lemon on hand,

33:44.720 --> 33:46.560
but do having begonias.

33:46.560 --> 33:49.040
Yeah, that's like, oh baby, it looks like we're out of honey

33:49.040 --> 33:51.200
that we need to make this pie crust.

33:51.200 --> 33:51.680
Oh, that's okay.

33:51.680 --> 33:56.560
Why don't you just go out in the garden and get me like 100,000 honeysuckles,

33:56.560 --> 33:58.800
and then we'll just spend four whole days getting this ready.

33:59.520 --> 34:00.160
Perfect.

34:00.160 --> 34:00.480
Perfect.

34:00.480 --> 34:01.600
That sounds like a great day to me.

34:02.320 --> 34:03.680
Thank you for the farm wisdom.

34:03.680 --> 34:04.480
Thanks.

34:04.480 --> 34:19.600
And let's take this newfound wisdom and drive it all the way into the money zone.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.720
This first message is from Margo Bookbinder Millman.

34:22.720 --> 34:23.120
Nope.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.440
I want, I just want to jump in real quick and say,

34:25.440 --> 34:29.280
I want Bookbinder to be like her professional wrestling.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.280
Like that's her title.

34:31.280 --> 34:34.320
Like Margo, the Bookbinder, Millman.

34:34.320 --> 34:36.000
This is clearly a pen name, right?

34:36.000 --> 34:37.520
This is obviously an essayist.

34:38.720 --> 34:41.840
Yeah, short personal essays about her life in Williamsburg

34:42.640 --> 34:45.760
and all the friends she's made, trials and tribulations.

34:45.760 --> 34:46.800
I look forward to reading it.

34:46.800 --> 34:54.160
Those friends include Lauren, Saia, Steph, Lynn, and Julie.

34:54.160 --> 34:57.360
So it's like, you think it's like Lauren-

34:57.360 --> 34:58.480
Which one is the-

34:58.480 --> 35:03.360
Lauren Wolfheart and Saia Pipesmoke.

35:04.400 --> 35:04.800
Okay.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.920
Happy birthday to our gorgeous, brilliant friend.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.800
We hope you and Dave have the most raucous celebration ever

35:10.800 --> 35:13.200
since it's your last one without kids.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.600
You should party so hard that your growing baby girl wonders

35:15.600 --> 35:17.360
what the fuck is going on out there.

35:17.360 --> 35:20.160
Fireworks, strippers, dry ice, rinse a tiger.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.800
On the other hand, maybe just a massage and a walk on the beach.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.960
Can we keep the swearing just to like-

35:24.960 --> 35:26.720
Just to a minimum around the maybe?

35:26.720 --> 35:29.120
As little as you possibly can in these messages.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.360
Hey, let us talk to your baby, Margot.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.080
Hey, Margot baby.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.360
Put your headphones on your baby.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.800
Hey, little bookbinder.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.640
Hi, bookbinder junior.

35:36.640 --> 35:37.600
Hey, little bundle.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.600
Have you been to maxfunstore.com?

35:39.600 --> 35:41.040
You can buy t-shirts.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.280
When you grow up, that's all you'll want to do.

35:43.280 --> 35:44.880
You will buy t-shirts.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.800
I think there's also maybe a couple tote bags left

35:46.800 --> 35:48.560
you could carry that baby around in.

35:48.560 --> 35:49.200
Buy a tote.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.560
We're talking to the baby right now.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.160
Put yourself in a bag.

35:52.160 --> 35:52.960
Put yourself in a bag.

35:52.960 --> 35:55.200
Hey, baby, put yourself in a bag with our faces on it, baby.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.960
Wouldn't it be nice if you could fill it with cotton swabs

35:56.960 --> 35:58.720
and just chill and be so comfortable

35:58.720 --> 36:00.960
and then eat them all and die, probably?

36:02.080 --> 36:03.680
Margot Bookbinder Millman, happy birthday to you.

36:03.680 --> 36:04.400
Happy birthday.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.360
Will and Allison Lewis, we got a message for you

36:07.360 --> 36:08.400
from Alex Swager.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.760
Travis, what do they have to say?

36:09.760 --> 36:11.200
Congrats to an amazing couple.

36:11.200 --> 36:14.080
They were married on June 1st and are both listeners.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.920
Will drove out to visit me in Cincinnati

36:15.920 --> 36:17.760
to go see Travis perform in Complete Works.

36:17.760 --> 36:18.880
Oh, thank you.

36:18.880 --> 36:21.120
I'm sure the blessing of their favorite trio of brothers

36:21.120 --> 36:23.360
would go a long way in helping them celebrate their love.

36:23.360 --> 36:24.160
Okay, brace your ass.

36:24.160 --> 36:26.160
Here it comes.

36:27.760 --> 36:28.640
You are blessed.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.560
That one got hung up like a sneeze.

36:32.560 --> 36:33.600
I thought it wasn't gonna-

36:33.600 --> 36:34.960
God bless you.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.400
It wasn't gonna come out, but then it did.

36:37.040 --> 36:38.960
Congratulations, Will and Allison.

36:38.960 --> 36:41.440
You got many happy years coming down the pipe.

36:42.880 --> 36:43.280
Maybe like-

36:43.280 --> 36:45.200
Do you take her last name or does she take yours?

36:45.200 --> 36:46.720
Are you a chauvinist or are you awesome?

36:47.760 --> 36:48.260
What?

36:49.760 --> 36:51.600
In this day and age, I think it's better for the man

36:51.600 --> 36:52.880
to take the woman's last name.

36:52.880 --> 36:54.720
Why are you all about building walls for people?

36:54.720 --> 36:58.560
I know, Travis, it's not about separating the genders

36:58.560 --> 37:02.640
more than we already have with the whole structure of it all,

37:02.640 --> 37:04.880
like the bureaucracy of just like business and government.

37:04.880 --> 37:07.920
We've like fucking driven the biggest wedge between them.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.760
And I think that that's like the biggest crime

37:09.760 --> 37:11.360
that we've done against like America.

37:11.360 --> 37:14.000
Actually, if you want to drive the biggest wedge

37:14.000 --> 37:17.520
between the genders, you can find that at extremerestraints.com.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.520
They probably do have some sex wedges up in there.

37:19.520 --> 37:21.360
They got sex wedges, that's no problem.

37:21.360 --> 37:23.200
If you're looking to reconnect with your partner,

37:23.200 --> 37:25.120
how about a double-ended dildo?

37:25.120 --> 37:28.400
And you can put one in your butt and one in her pussy

37:28.400 --> 37:29.760
and then you can fuck each other.

37:29.760 --> 37:30.800
Oh God, Justin.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.080
No, that's Griffin.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.560
No, but you got to ramp up to that.

37:34.560 --> 37:36.320
Like maybe you stay like puss first

37:36.320 --> 37:38.720
and then like you get, you can add that.

37:38.720 --> 37:42.000
They have a sex ramp if you want to ramp up to it.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.320
Build some momentum, you mean.

37:44.320 --> 37:44.720
It's good.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.280
Go to the top and you can jump on it with your sex skateboard.

37:47.280 --> 37:47.780
Right.

37:48.640 --> 37:50.720
Just make sure you have Sex Bart Simpson there

37:50.720 --> 37:52.640
to tell you how to do all the sweet tricks.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.920
Sex bodacious, man.

37:54.560 --> 37:55.440
Sexabunga.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.320
Don't have a cow in the bedroom.

38:04.320 --> 38:07.680
Extremerestraints.com is your adult superstore.

38:07.680 --> 38:12.720
Super discreet, super sexual, very erotic.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.200
I just got my, as for being a max fun donor,

38:16.480 --> 38:17.600
because that's how I roll,

38:17.600 --> 38:20.880
I got my intimate sensations pack in the mail,

38:20.880 --> 38:24.800
a sex blindfold, a bottle of rocket lube

38:24.800 --> 38:27.360
and a personal massager.

38:27.360 --> 38:28.400
I don't know I have any muscles.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.080
And a pair of sex headphones.

38:30.080 --> 38:33.200
That are the size of this vibrator.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.720
You put the lube in your ear

38:34.720 --> 38:36.720
and you can really get those sex headphones in there.

38:37.600 --> 38:38.880
Oh man, they fit great.

38:38.880 --> 38:39.680
They fit so good.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.400
And when you're at Extremerestraints.com,

38:43.440 --> 38:44.880
you'll see prices,

38:44.880 --> 38:47.520
but those are, for my brother, my brother and me, Finn,

38:47.520 --> 38:49.200
those are a mere suggestion.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.120
They don't apply to you

38:51.120 --> 38:52.320
because you're gonna save 20%

38:53.120 --> 38:55.360
with our hot new coupon code, Sexabunga.

38:55.360 --> 38:58.000
Swordfish has been fucking compromised.

38:59.120 --> 39:00.560
Swordfish is compromised.

39:01.360 --> 39:03.040
Can we go with Sexabunga?

39:03.040 --> 39:03.760
Is that possible?

39:03.760 --> 39:05.760
We gotta establish a spelling right now.

39:05.760 --> 39:06.800
How do you think it's spelled?

39:06.800 --> 39:08.880
I mean, I think it's pretty,

39:08.880 --> 39:11.280
if we all agree on how we think Sexabunga is spelled,

39:11.280 --> 39:12.960
I think it should be fairly clear.

39:12.960 --> 39:16.160
S-E-X-A-B-U-N-G-A, right?

39:16.160 --> 39:16.800
Okay, Sexabunga.

39:16.800 --> 39:17.520
Sexabunga.

39:17.520 --> 39:18.240
Sexabunga.

39:18.800 --> 39:21.840
Sexabunga is the new coupon code.

39:22.400 --> 39:23.440
It's what Sexparts says.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.480
Now listen, listen to me.

39:26.080 --> 39:27.440
This is a fucking good one.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.080
Whoever leaked Swordfish, thank you.

39:30.080 --> 39:31.360
It was not our best work.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.800
No, don't say thank you.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.560
No, thank you to whoever leaked Swordfish.

39:34.560 --> 39:35.760
It was not our best work.

39:35.760 --> 39:36.960
It was not a good,

39:36.960 --> 39:39.520
because we want people to type it in and feel silly

39:39.520 --> 39:41.040
because it's like, oh, this is like a fun word.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.800
And then they think of us like,

39:42.800 --> 39:45.280
fondly, and then they, you know,

39:45.280 --> 39:46.560
shove something in their butt.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.760
And they think of us fondly.

39:47.760 --> 39:48.320
I like that.

39:48.320 --> 39:49.040
I like that.

39:49.040 --> 39:50.400
When they put in Swordfish, they're like,

39:50.400 --> 39:51.760
where did I hear this code again?

39:51.760 --> 39:53.040
God, that was a great movie.

39:53.040 --> 39:54.320
And then they've forgotten all about us

39:54.320 --> 39:55.360
when they shove it in their butt.

39:56.720 --> 39:59.920
They think about Halle Berry's groundbreaking nude scene.

39:59.920 --> 40:00.560
They don't think about us.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.160
So don't tell anybody about it,

40:02.160 --> 40:04.160
but do go to extremistrace.com

40:04.880 --> 40:07.600
and, you know,

40:07.600 --> 40:09.680
buy yourself some adult supplies

40:09.680 --> 40:11.120
that you need for adult life.

40:11.120 --> 40:12.160
Mm-hmm.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.760
And enjoy yourself.

40:13.760 --> 40:14.960
Sexabunga, save 20%.

40:14.960 --> 40:44.400
You've earned it.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.200
I'm ready.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.040
This one was sent in by Ira Ray.

40:47.760 --> 40:48.560
Thank you, Ira Ray.

40:49.200 --> 40:49.760
It's by Yahoo!

40:49.760 --> 40:51.600
Answer's user, haha, who asks,

40:53.680 --> 40:57.680
when twerking, do boys ever talk or say anything?

40:59.200 --> 41:02.240
When twerking on a boy, do they say anything

41:02.240 --> 41:03.840
or are they just silent?

41:03.840 --> 41:05.120
Do they even make a sound?

41:06.160 --> 41:07.440
This is from four.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.640
This is such a zen question.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.800
This is from four fucking years ago.

41:11.360 --> 41:14.080
If a girl twerks in the forest and no one's around,

41:14.080 --> 41:15.520
does the guy make a sound?

41:15.520 --> 41:16.320
No, because the guy's-

41:16.320 --> 41:18.080
What is the sound of one hand twerking?

41:20.560 --> 41:21.760
Stop it.

41:21.760 --> 41:22.320
Oh, God.

41:22.320 --> 41:23.040
We don't need it.

41:23.040 --> 41:23.840
Oh, God.

41:23.840 --> 41:24.560
It's terrible.

41:24.560 --> 41:25.200
Don't need it.

41:26.880 --> 41:30.000
Can God create a butt so big even he can't twerk it?

41:36.160 --> 41:37.280
You know, people always ask this,

41:37.280 --> 41:38.800
why do you guys have Travis on the show?

41:39.680 --> 41:42.080
And is it for moments exactly like this?

41:42.080 --> 41:43.920
His theology is like on point.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.880
This question is from four goddamn years ago.

41:48.880 --> 41:52.400
I did not know that twerking happened in 2009.

41:52.400 --> 41:55.520
I thought that twerking was an invention of a modern era.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.480
In 2009, no longer counts as the modern era.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.200
That's the speed at which we're working.

42:01.200 --> 42:02.400
I know, and twerking.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.360
It feels like time is moving by a little bit faster.

42:07.360 --> 42:12.240
Do you think all the twerking is like sped up the rotation

42:12.240 --> 42:14.480
of our Earth, of the planet?

42:15.200 --> 42:15.360
Think about it.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.880
That seems unlikely.

42:16.880 --> 42:17.280
I'm just saying.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.120
It's more likely it's causing global warming

42:19.120 --> 42:21.920
because the force of it's pushing us out of rotation.

42:21.920 --> 42:22.560
I guess it makes sense.

42:22.560 --> 42:24.160
When people say, God, that twerking's hot.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.680
That's some hot twerking.

42:25.680 --> 42:27.920
And then it's like, the sun's like, ugh.

42:28.480 --> 42:30.640
Now, is that something that's said during the twerking

42:30.640 --> 42:32.560
or is that said by an outside observer?

42:33.920 --> 42:35.680
Like observing the twerking.

42:35.680 --> 42:38.160
Observing the twerk is the only thing that makes it twerking.

42:38.160 --> 42:39.840
Otherwise, you're just having a butt seizure.

42:39.840 --> 42:42.640
But if someone sees you twerking, then it's like, oh,

42:42.640 --> 42:43.440
now it's a twerk.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.120
One Yahoo!

42:47.120 --> 42:50.160
Answer respondent said, well, I would love to help you,

42:50.160 --> 42:52.080
but I don't understand the question you're asking.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.160
Somebody else said they had to Google it.

42:56.160 --> 42:58.400
It's like, guys, it's fucking 2013 now.

42:58.400 --> 43:00.000
Everybody knows what this is.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.200
Read a fucking book.

43:01.200 --> 43:02.800
Although I guess in 2009, that's what I'm saying.

43:02.800 --> 43:04.560
This person was on the fucking cutting.

43:04.560 --> 43:06.000
The butting edge.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.020
No.

43:11.120 --> 43:11.520
No.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.760
There's nothing you can say when that's happening to you.

43:13.760 --> 43:15.280
You can't be like, oh, this is great.

43:16.400 --> 43:17.040
Oh, yeah.

43:17.040 --> 43:18.080
This is fantastic.

43:18.080 --> 43:18.960
Two thumbs up.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.040
Sexabunga.

43:21.040 --> 43:22.240
Sexabunga.

43:22.240 --> 43:22.960
Yahoo!

43:22.960 --> 43:26.880
The better question is, does any guy while dancing with any

43:26.880 --> 43:28.640
girl ever say anything?

43:28.640 --> 43:29.040
No.

43:29.040 --> 43:32.800
Especially not when you're talking about back to front dancing.

43:32.800 --> 43:34.080
There's nothing you can say.

43:34.080 --> 43:34.560
Yeah.

43:34.560 --> 43:35.600
What if you did, though?

43:35.600 --> 43:36.480
What if you could find it?

43:36.480 --> 43:37.680
What if you could thread that needle?

43:37.680 --> 43:39.040
Let me get let me hit you guys with this.

43:39.920 --> 43:40.420
Okay.

43:44.800 --> 43:47.440
Like you're on like a like you're on a Ferris wheel or something.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.240
Ferris wheels don't usually listen to that reaction actually.

43:51.280 --> 43:53.120
Who's the loser now, dad?

43:53.120 --> 43:55.120
Yeah, that's that's fine.

43:55.120 --> 44:00.240
Can you say like, can you make a banal observation such as this my jam?

44:00.240 --> 44:04.560
When a new when a new jam starts, can you just announce this my jam?

44:04.560 --> 44:07.920
Yeah, but you have to be careful because if you get too automated with that, like fucking

44:07.920 --> 44:10.160
Betty Davis eyes will come on and be like, oh, here it goes.

44:10.160 --> 44:11.120
This is my jam.

44:11.120 --> 44:11.680
Keep don't.

44:11.680 --> 44:13.440
Who's twerking to Betty Davis?

44:13.440 --> 44:14.320
Me every day.

44:17.120 --> 44:21.360
Man, if there is a better way to get fired as a DJ, I do not know.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.720
I got another one for you guys.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.440
There is yellow gold.

44:26.000 --> 44:26.880
Got this.

44:26.880 --> 44:28.320
My jam step.

44:28.320 --> 44:29.040
Fuck yeah.

44:29.040 --> 44:31.600
Yeah, spin it again, DJ.

44:31.600 --> 44:33.520
Put Betty Davis on the ones and twos.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.160
It'd need to be more ironic DJs.

44:37.360 --> 44:42.400
I think there are probably a shit ton of ironic DJs.

44:42.400 --> 44:43.360
Probably a lot.

44:43.360 --> 44:44.640
Probably quite a few.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.800
Like Tiesto, like that.

44:48.800 --> 44:49.680
Tiesto.

44:49.680 --> 44:51.440
I'm only into Kim Carnes.

44:53.040 --> 44:54.960
That's who I'm ironic Tiesto.

44:54.960 --> 44:58.000
I don't think, I think you probably just don't say anything.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.280
I don't, I don't do much but-

44:59.280 --> 45:00.320
You just say thank you.

45:01.040 --> 45:01.760
I guess.

45:02.960 --> 45:04.320
I appreciate your hard work.

45:05.040 --> 45:09.680
I like when I, when we used to go to the fucking gym factory for late nights at the gym factory,

45:10.320 --> 45:13.120
I used to say like, sorry for my like shitty boner.

45:13.120 --> 45:18.000
Like sorry I'm fucking 12 and I don't know how, I don't know what I'm doing.

45:18.000 --> 45:23.280
Sorry I'm so like completely out of my depth and fucking terrified and God, it smells awful in here.

45:23.280 --> 45:27.920
Thank you for allowing me to stand behind you as though I were also dancing.

45:27.920 --> 45:28.320
Yes.

45:28.320 --> 45:33.840
If the, if the, man, if you put all those hard, you know, you pay for the classes,

45:34.560 --> 45:39.520
you do the strengthening exercises and finally you work yourself up to a solid twerk

45:40.080 --> 45:47.120
and the guy does not appreciate that in some manner, vocally, bonerly,

45:47.120 --> 45:50.960
like any, any sort of appreciation for the twerk I think is going to be appreciated.

45:50.960 --> 45:51.520
So you think like-

45:51.520 --> 45:52.400
It's going to be a welcome-

45:52.400 --> 45:56.960
You think the gentleman could be like masterful, bravissimo.

45:57.760 --> 46:02.720
Congratulations, encore, author, author, author.

46:02.720 --> 46:03.280
It's as though-

46:03.280 --> 46:04.560
Who is the author of this twerk?

46:04.560 --> 46:08.320
It's as though your butt cheeks are moving independent from one another.

46:08.320 --> 46:09.920
I've never seen anything like it.

46:11.120 --> 46:14.240
You have the jiggling of a young Judy Garland twerking.

46:14.880 --> 46:18.880
Don't ever, you just ruined, you ruined everything.

46:18.880 --> 46:22.240
You ruined everything.

46:23.680 --> 46:25.200
Man, you done fucked up just now.

46:26.240 --> 46:32.880
Griffin and I spent this week in a hotel room at the Essex Manor and Suites,

46:32.880 --> 46:35.680
which if you have not stayed in it, don't.

46:35.680 --> 46:36.480
Don't ever.

46:36.480 --> 46:37.680
But don't.

46:38.400 --> 46:47.040
It's an, it's, it's amazing because every room is themed to like an old Hollywood sort of,

46:47.040 --> 46:49.920
sort of celeb, so there's a WC Fields room.

46:49.920 --> 46:50.240
Cool.

46:50.240 --> 46:54.000
Last year we were treated to the Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball suite.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.360
Perfect, that's what I love.

46:56.080 --> 46:59.040
This year we were in the Judy Garland suite.

47:00.480 --> 47:08.080
Let's just say the super creepy hotel attendant put a little extra TLC on the Judy Garland room,

47:08.080 --> 47:08.800
I think.

47:08.800 --> 47:12.560
I went into some of the other rooms, not nearly as much memorabilia,

47:12.560 --> 47:15.280
not nearly as much, you know, like memorable snapshots.

47:15.280 --> 47:20.000
Uh, this has every, this really covers her entire career.

47:20.000 --> 47:25.200
You cannot see, there is not an angle, there's not a vantage point in this room

47:25.200 --> 47:28.800
that you can open your eyes and not see at least three Judys.

47:28.800 --> 47:31.360
There's three Judys per eye look.

47:31.360 --> 47:34.880
And I think the best thing about the room is it really captured that one moment

47:34.880 --> 47:40.800
where Judy Garland was murdered in a hotel room because Jesus fuck, it was the creepiest.

47:40.800 --> 47:42.480
It really summed up that vibe.

47:42.480 --> 47:44.320
So Essex Manor and Suites, don't miss it.

47:44.320 --> 47:44.800
Don't miss it.

47:44.800 --> 47:48.080
They call it on their website, furnished studio apartments.

47:48.080 --> 47:49.680
Don't let that fool you.

47:49.680 --> 47:52.080
These are apartments furnished by a mad man.

47:54.080 --> 47:56.000
A mad elderly gay man.

47:56.720 --> 47:59.040
Um, how about a question?

47:59.040 --> 47:59.680
A regular one.

48:00.480 --> 48:01.200
Fantastic.

48:01.920 --> 48:04.080
From time to time I babysit my niece.

48:04.080 --> 48:08.640
She is beautiful and smart and five years old.

48:08.640 --> 48:12.320
The only problem is that she really likes to show toddlers and Tiaras.

48:12.320 --> 48:13.840
Oh no.

48:13.840 --> 48:16.000
I believe it's toddlers and Tiaras.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.480
Although toddlers and Tiaras works just as well.

48:18.480 --> 48:20.480
It could also be toddlers and Tiaras.

48:21.520 --> 48:22.800
Tiaras or Tiaras.

48:23.520 --> 48:27.440
She knows toddlers, but Tiaras.

48:28.080 --> 48:31.760
She knows all the contestants names and really wants to be one of them.

48:33.280 --> 48:34.720
What can I do brothers?

48:34.720 --> 48:39.760
I'm merely her uncle, but I feel as if I should keep the show from molding her young mind.

48:39.760 --> 48:41.840
Or should I leave it alone?

48:43.120 --> 48:43.760
Okay.

48:43.760 --> 48:44.960
That's enough from Oklahoma.

48:44.960 --> 48:46.080
Oh, what you should do.

48:46.080 --> 48:49.040
You should support her and shape her into a winner.

48:49.040 --> 48:51.920
Oh, get that kid and get out of here.

48:51.920 --> 48:53.600
Does she have a complete package?

48:53.600 --> 48:54.400
Perfect then.

48:54.400 --> 48:56.240
Does she have the personality?

48:56.240 --> 48:57.600
Do you need to get her a flipper?

48:57.600 --> 49:01.120
Do you need to get her some kind of hair piece to really give her the volume that the judges

49:01.120 --> 49:01.680
are looking for?

49:02.400 --> 49:03.440
What's her talent?

49:03.440 --> 49:04.720
Don't do the terrible thing.

49:04.720 --> 49:06.240
What kind of costumes are you doing?

49:06.240 --> 49:09.360
Can you do like a number with you and her and do kind of a dance thing?

49:09.360 --> 49:10.160
Cause the judges love that.

49:10.160 --> 49:10.880
Oh, here's a fun number.

49:10.880 --> 49:11.600
Here's a fun number.

49:12.320 --> 49:16.160
The fun number is you take the kid and you get in the car and you fucking raising Arizona

49:16.160 --> 49:17.360
it and you get the fuck out of there.

49:17.360 --> 49:19.760
And then you and her live on the grid for the next 10 years.

49:19.760 --> 49:23.520
You know, you might have to pay a little bit extra to get a coach, but really you'll see

49:23.520 --> 49:24.160
it pay off.

49:24.160 --> 49:27.760
You are this little broad's last shot at a normal fucking life.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.400
If you can get her out, if you can extricate her.

49:30.400 --> 49:34.160
You are this little broad's last shot at a great base tan.

49:34.160 --> 49:35.200
No follow up.

49:36.160 --> 49:38.800
Listen, when you spray tan, she's going to giggle, right?

49:38.800 --> 49:42.160
But you tell her that winners don't giggle and you tell her to focus on my God.

49:42.160 --> 49:44.240
You run her routine four to five times a week.

49:44.240 --> 49:47.680
You might have to build a little stage just for her to have a better level.

49:47.680 --> 49:52.480
She would have maybe set up a judges table and get you and like maybe like if she has

49:52.480 --> 49:56.080
any brothers or sisters to really judge her and give her notes and let her know there

49:56.080 --> 49:56.800
will be judgment.

49:56.800 --> 49:57.920
You're right, Travis.

49:57.920 --> 50:03.040
You need to take this little broad to the fucking to the fucking rail yard, throw her

50:03.040 --> 50:07.600
into a box car and just say this is your life now because this is this is this is the life

50:07.600 --> 50:08.640
that I have chosen for you.

50:08.640 --> 50:11.920
I know it's not ideal, but it's way better than that other bullshit.

50:11.920 --> 50:15.040
And listen, the dress is going to cost you like fifteen hundred dollars and the prize

50:15.040 --> 50:16.480
money is probably only like five hundred.

50:16.480 --> 50:18.000
So you're not doing it for the money.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.720
You're doing it for her because this is her dream.

50:20.720 --> 50:21.760
Her dream to be a winner.

50:21.760 --> 50:22.880
You want the confidence.

50:22.880 --> 50:23.520
I love that.

50:23.520 --> 50:29.840
I love that idea where you're her parents say to you, hey, you took Skylar for ice cream

50:29.840 --> 50:31.920
and we haven't seen her for a few days.

50:31.920 --> 50:32.880
Do you know what happened?

50:32.880 --> 50:35.440
And you say, I don't know a Skylar.

50:35.440 --> 50:37.440
I I know Whistlin Sarah.

50:37.440 --> 50:41.440
Yeah, but I know Sarah Bookbinder, but she's riding the rails.

50:41.440 --> 50:43.600
Son to to Pork and Beans Bill.

50:44.640 --> 50:45.600
That's her daddy now.

50:46.160 --> 50:48.800
What if fucking Pork and Beans Bill has like a fucking portable TV?

50:48.800 --> 50:50.480
He's like, hey, you seen that show?

50:50.480 --> 50:51.840
Hey, let me show you the show.

50:51.840 --> 50:52.640
You're real pretty.

50:52.640 --> 50:53.360
You would be my tech.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.440
You would be my tech Whistlin Sarah.

50:57.520 --> 50:58.000
What is it?

50:58.000 --> 50:59.120
What's your special talent?

50:59.120 --> 50:59.840
Oh, Whistlin?

50:59.840 --> 51:02.640
Yeah, Pork and Beans probably should have figured that one out on his own.

51:03.840 --> 51:04.640
Here's the worst part.

51:04.640 --> 51:05.440
I don't like you.

51:05.440 --> 51:06.960
I don't even like Pork and Beans.

51:06.960 --> 51:08.160
I don't know why I chose this one.

51:08.160 --> 51:08.880
It's an ironic.

51:08.880 --> 51:09.840
It's an ironic name.

51:09.840 --> 51:12.000
It's like when I sing Bette Davis eyes.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.360
People are like, why do you like that song?

51:13.360 --> 51:13.920
I'm like, I don't.

51:13.920 --> 51:14.560
It's a fun.

51:14.560 --> 51:15.760
It's like a fun joke.

51:16.480 --> 51:18.000
I'm an ironic hobo DJ.

51:20.720 --> 51:22.560
Man, sometimes I just listen to this show.

51:22.560 --> 51:23.360
It's pretty funny.

51:27.200 --> 51:30.080
This is why it must be like this all the time.

51:30.080 --> 51:32.640
For those of you at home, I can't imagine what it's like.

51:34.320 --> 51:35.360
What a delight that must be.

51:35.360 --> 51:36.160
Get that kid out of there.

51:36.160 --> 51:36.800
You want to Yahoo?

51:38.400 --> 51:38.640
Sure.

51:40.640 --> 51:41.920
This one is sent in by Adam P.

51:41.920 --> 51:44.000
Why don't little girls get to be hobos?

51:45.360 --> 51:47.200
Why can't they chase their dreams?

51:47.200 --> 51:49.760
Just get that rambling phase over early.

51:49.760 --> 51:50.160
All right.

51:50.160 --> 51:53.040
Take a year off between preschool and first grade.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.720
Serious, literal question.

51:54.720 --> 51:58.800
If your daughter was going to be deep, deep, deep into the pageant scene

51:58.800 --> 52:02.800
or deep, deep, deep into the hobo scene, which scene would you want her to be in?

52:02.800 --> 52:04.400
You stibbled on a little beard.

52:04.400 --> 52:05.120
No, hold on.

52:05.120 --> 52:06.960
Let's make it clear because this is a very sensitive subject.

52:06.960 --> 52:10.960
We're not talking about homeless people because there's nothing inherently funny about that.

52:10.960 --> 52:13.120
But when they live on trains, they're hobos, right?

52:13.120 --> 52:15.280
Yes, we're talking about rambling lifestyle.

52:15.280 --> 52:16.240
Kings of the rails.

52:18.000 --> 52:18.640
And queens.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.120
This Yahoo answer is sent in by Adam P.

52:21.120 --> 52:21.840
Thank you, Adam.

52:21.840 --> 52:24.160
It's by Yahoo answers user Jalen, who asks,

52:25.120 --> 52:28.880
I have a food idea for Papa John, but no, if it has been done,

52:28.880 --> 52:36.080
I want to sell an idea of Papa John Hot Pocket.

52:36.080 --> 52:37.200
One more time.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.240
One more time.

52:38.240 --> 52:40.800
I have a food idea for Papa John, but no, if it has been done,

52:40.800 --> 52:43.360
I want to sell an idea of Papa John Hot Pocket.

52:45.360 --> 52:49.520
Sell Papa John Hot Pocket in stores like Food Lion, Walmart.

52:51.600 --> 52:52.960
He didn't know any other stores.

52:53.600 --> 52:54.240
Et cetera.

52:55.440 --> 52:56.320
I love Papa John.

52:56.320 --> 53:00.240
Okay, so this is not Papa John that will deliver Hot Pockets to you.

53:00.240 --> 53:01.520
No, he's talking about my little-

53:01.520 --> 53:02.480
This is Papa John brand.

53:02.480 --> 53:03.920
Yeah, get an old retail franchise going.

53:03.920 --> 53:07.680
This is the perfect product for the person that wants that hot,

53:07.680 --> 53:11.760
fresh Papa John's flavor, but doesn't want the inconvenience of calling.

53:12.800 --> 53:17.200
Or the inconvenience of eating anything hot and or fresh.

53:18.640 --> 53:21.040
Yeah, you don't want either of those things to happen.

53:21.040 --> 53:23.520
Does this person mean like a calzone?

53:23.520 --> 53:27.920
This, no, I think there are some pretty important structural,

53:27.920 --> 53:30.720
mechanical, and conceptual differences between a hot pocket and a calzone.

53:30.720 --> 53:31.920
There are pizza Hot Pockets.

53:31.920 --> 53:34.320
We're just talking about a branding thing, right?

53:34.320 --> 53:35.680
Well, it's not just branding, too.

53:35.680 --> 53:41.360
It's flavor, because you're not going to get that rubbery skin-like texture

53:41.360 --> 53:44.000
that you really get from a Papa John's pizza from just a regular Hot Pocket.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.560
Don't you fucking start on Papa John's right now, okay?

53:46.560 --> 53:46.960
Okay.

53:46.960 --> 53:48.320
I'm tired of it.

53:48.320 --> 53:49.120
I'm tired of it.

53:50.560 --> 53:52.160
I understand what this guy's saying.

53:52.160 --> 53:54.240
Nobody's ever eaten a Hot Pocket and felt good about themselves,

53:54.240 --> 54:00.080
but what they do feel good about is how efficient that vehicle is.

54:01.200 --> 54:01.920
Right.

54:01.920 --> 54:03.520
It's a great food delivery mechanism.

54:03.520 --> 54:08.000
It is arguably the best, until they invent a gun that you shoot in your mouth,

54:08.000 --> 54:09.920
and then all the food comes out of it.

54:09.920 --> 54:12.560
Like, this is the best we're going to do.

54:14.240 --> 54:20.400
Back in the early 1900s, miners' wives used to just send Hot Pockets with them

54:20.400 --> 54:23.920
to the mines, and then they would put their Hot Pocket on a shovel

54:23.920 --> 54:26.320
and heat it up with the lamps from their thing.

54:26.320 --> 54:29.040
And if the Hot Pocket died, then they would know that there was a gas leak,

54:29.040 --> 54:29.680
and they had to leave.

54:29.680 --> 54:30.160
Exactly.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.760
I'll tell you one thing that's really interesting about Hot Pockets,

54:33.760 --> 54:36.560
and this really changed my whole perspective on the thing,

54:36.560 --> 54:43.040
is that if you put them in the oven and cook them for like 25 minutes at 350,

54:43.040 --> 54:46.080
something like that, they are legitimately really tasty.

54:46.080 --> 54:47.280
Okay, first of all, fuck off.

54:47.280 --> 54:50.960
It's just the problem is that you...

54:51.840 --> 54:54.000
I don't know anybody who's ever said,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.480
I'm going to want to eat a Hot Pocket in a half hour.

54:56.480 --> 55:01.920
No, that's enough time to rethink your Hot Pocket decision like 10 times over.

55:01.920 --> 55:03.200
You eat a Hot Pocket and you're like,

55:03.200 --> 55:07.360
I need to have a full meal in my belly in the next 180 seconds.

55:07.920 --> 55:10.960
I have 180 seconds to put a full meal inside my belly.

55:10.960 --> 55:13.760
Because at 182 seconds, I have a rethought.

55:13.760 --> 55:17.680
It is 7.57, Bachelorette is on in three minutes,

55:17.680 --> 55:19.360
and I'm going to drink a full bottle of red wine.

55:19.360 --> 55:23.120
I need to put fucking calories in my body in 180 seconds,

55:23.120 --> 55:24.800
in the length of a commercial break.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.560
The two or three times in my life that I've ever baked a Hot Pocket in the oven,

55:30.560 --> 55:32.240
even like a frozen burrito or anything like that.

55:32.240 --> 55:33.760
What the fuck are you guys talking about?

55:33.760 --> 55:36.640
I can't believe this is something you guys have ever fucking actually done.

55:37.200 --> 55:37.920
It's delicious.

55:37.920 --> 55:41.040
This was the time in my life when I was a highfalutin college student.

55:41.040 --> 55:43.920
Of the few times that I've flown to Los Angeles on a kite.

55:43.920 --> 55:45.920
Like, what the fuck are you talking about?

55:45.920 --> 55:47.360
That's not how you do the thing.

55:48.960 --> 55:51.520
I think it has the directions on the package.

55:51.520 --> 55:54.080
Yeah, as a fucking goof.

55:54.080 --> 55:56.720
Hot Pockets says you can microwave a Pop-Tart.

55:56.720 --> 56:01.200
Take this Hot Pockets to a restaurant and ask if you can borrow their convection oven.

56:01.200 --> 56:03.520
Like, no, you fucking dullard.

56:03.520 --> 56:05.840
You put it in the stupid box.

56:05.840 --> 56:09.280
You put it in the dump box and it fucking heats up your trash food for you.

56:09.280 --> 56:11.600
The best is when you grill the Hot Pocket.

56:11.600 --> 56:14.400
It's a really nice outdoor barbecue kind of setting.

56:14.400 --> 56:17.120
Some friends and your cat is shitting on your herb.

56:17.120 --> 56:21.600
Throw that bitch on a smoker and oh, you have got yourself a flavor treat.

56:21.600 --> 56:24.400
Now it's going to be an all day thing because you're going to want to cold smoke it.

56:25.040 --> 56:31.600
Throw it in the crock pot for 72 hours and you are just gonna shit yourself to death

56:31.600 --> 56:34.720
because it's a Hot Pocket and that's the only thing that can happen with those.

56:34.720 --> 56:39.120
I, uh, man, I would buy one though.

56:39.120 --> 56:44.400
Aren't you curious if they can capture the experience?

56:44.400 --> 56:46.080
I'll be honest with you.

56:46.080 --> 56:50.320
Every time I'm at the H-E-B walking in the frozen food aisle and I see that there's a

56:50.320 --> 56:55.920
new experimental pretzel bread lean pocket flavor, I'll tip my toe in.

56:55.920 --> 56:57.120
I'm not above it.

56:57.120 --> 57:02.160
But I fucking recognize the shamefulness of the action.

57:02.160 --> 57:07.520
Like I'm not like, how can I maximize the pleasure of this Hot Pockets experience?

57:07.520 --> 57:12.320
What can I do to really add that special twist on this Hot Pocket?

57:12.320 --> 57:16.720
It's like I just, I'm going to eat this and I'm going to do it when nobody else is around

57:16.720 --> 57:18.320
and I'm going to fucking pull the blind shut.

57:19.360 --> 57:21.120
This is what would sell me on it.

57:21.120 --> 57:27.520
If Papa John's as an added like amenity to buying the Hot Pocket, kept up with the tracker

57:27.520 --> 57:32.000
idea and tracked your Hot Pocket from freezer to regret.

57:32.000 --> 57:32.240
Yeah.

57:32.240 --> 57:37.360
And so it started like Travis has had one too many beers, he's late night hungry.

57:37.360 --> 57:41.200
It's just like, it's fucking instantaneous because it's like, please click when you start

57:41.200 --> 57:43.920
eating the Hot Pocket and then you click it and they're like, oh, it's already at your

57:43.920 --> 57:44.240
butt.

57:44.240 --> 57:45.120
It's already at your butt.

57:46.160 --> 57:47.040
That's just how it does.

57:47.840 --> 57:49.280
Travis has begun to regret.

57:49.280 --> 57:50.320
Oh, he regrets a lot.

57:51.920 --> 57:52.640
Oh, folks.

57:52.640 --> 57:53.760
Do you want to tweet this?

57:53.760 --> 57:56.000
Do you want to tweet the status of your Hot Pocket?

57:56.000 --> 57:57.360
Do you want to tweet your butt shame?

57:57.360 --> 58:02.640
I double that with double that with fucking Papa John's and you are talking about a human

58:02.640 --> 58:03.440
super soaker.

58:04.000 --> 58:04.480
Holy shit.

58:06.480 --> 58:07.440
Holy shit indeed.

58:07.440 --> 58:09.200
It's just like dropping it down a well.

58:09.200 --> 58:10.000
Please let me end it.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.560
I don't want to talk about diarrhea anymore for once.

58:12.560 --> 58:13.600
It's Father's Day.

58:13.600 --> 58:14.080
Fuck.

58:15.680 --> 58:19.920
We've had such a lot of fun here today and we really appreciate you joining us for our

58:19.920 --> 58:21.440
comedy podcast.

58:21.440 --> 58:25.920
I want to give a quick thank you to some people who've been sending us stuff in our live

58:25.920 --> 58:29.200
and people who've been sending us stuff in our mailbox.

58:29.200 --> 58:32.240
That's PO Box 5400 West Virginia 25706.

58:32.960 --> 58:35.840
Alex in Minneapolis made us some cookies.

58:35.840 --> 58:37.040
They were delicious.

58:38.080 --> 58:42.240
One of my favorites came unmarked from Portland.

58:42.240 --> 58:43.360
There's no name on it.

58:43.360 --> 58:48.960
There's just a picture of a man wrapped in plastic bags is the is the hilarious post

58:48.960 --> 58:49.520
card.

58:49.520 --> 58:55.120
And on the inside, written in Sharpie, it says it's the only way he can climax.

58:55.120 --> 58:56.720
Thank you.

58:56.720 --> 58:57.600
Thank you for that.

58:57.600 --> 58:58.400
That's wonderful.

59:00.800 --> 59:01.360
Let's see here.

59:01.360 --> 59:07.280
We got one from Thailand from Lauren that was definitely not Photoshop.

59:07.280 --> 59:11.920
Yeah, it's Ronald McDonald standing in front of a waterfall and it's fantastic.

59:13.040 --> 59:20.000
We have a pretty creepy one that just has a picture of a man on his couch drinking beer

59:20.000 --> 59:24.080
and it's unsigned but it's hand drawn and it's lovely.

59:24.080 --> 59:25.040
So thank you for that.

59:25.040 --> 59:32.160
And then last postcard came to the brothers McElroy from Mount Rogers National Recreation

59:32.160 --> 59:35.280
Era from Kyle Latham and Tyler Ewing.

59:35.280 --> 59:37.680
They were hiking through the Appalachian Trail and they thought of us.

59:37.680 --> 59:40.000
So thank you so much to you folks.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.040
That's super nice of you.

59:42.240 --> 59:44.960
And thank you to you for listening to our show.

59:44.960 --> 59:46.240
Sorry we took a week off there.

59:47.040 --> 59:49.040
Oh, this is our first show since Max Fun Con.

59:49.040 --> 59:49.760
It was great.

59:49.760 --> 59:52.240
Thanks everybody who was there and who supported us.

59:52.240 --> 59:54.160
It was the most fun weekend.

59:54.160 --> 59:55.920
Seriously, super great time.

59:56.480 --> 01:00:02.160
If you get a second and you can give our show a review on iTunes, that really helps us out

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:02.320
a lot.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.720
If you like what you heard, go review it.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.560
Maybe recommend the show to a friend.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.480
That would mean a lot to us.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.360
Please tell a friend.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.640
You can share the sampler.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.760
Justin made a new sampler.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:18.160
It's really great and it's a great cross section of how fucking dumb we are sometimes.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.440
It's bit.ly forward slash mabimbam2013.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.160
Is that right?

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:22.640
That's right.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:22.880
Yeah.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.120
So thank you for that.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.320
Please keep sharing the show.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.520
Thank you for listening.

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.040
And Griffin has one final question.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.400
Absolutely.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:36.080
For the use of our theme song, it's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:36.400
Great.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.200
Great way to just a great song.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.160
Just a great album and a great song and a great band and a good friend.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.360
I haven't met him personally, but I bet he's a good friend to the friends he's friends with.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:47.920
You know what I mean?

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.080
Here we go.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.440
Oh, last question.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.040
This one is sent by Charles Decker.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:53.920
Thank you, Charles Decker.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.240
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Ive, who asks.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.440
Is Mr. Pringle still alive?

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.440
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.160
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:06.960
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.520
This has been my brother over brother to me.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.480
Kiss your dad.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:24.000
Square on the lips.
