00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:45.920 --> 00:49.360
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

00:49.360 --> 00:58.480
I'm your oldest brother Justin big points McElroy and I'm Travis high score McElroy.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.720
Hold on guys. I've almost got I've almost got the high score. I need to shoot like two more

01:04.720 --> 01:12.640
space men. One second has Griffin. I did it. I want it. I want the tiger handheld game that

01:12.640 --> 01:19.040
I've been playing because it's E3. We're at it folks. E3 is off and popping. I'm sure you saw

01:19.040 --> 01:25.200
a lot of the big announcements later today. That tense got away from me, but you know,

01:27.200 --> 01:34.240
video games are here to stay and I love them in a major way. Rap I'm working on about.

01:34.240 --> 01:41.200
I love them more than I love them more than anything. All day gaming all day. I dream about

01:41.200 --> 01:50.400
us gaming soccer video games soccer video games. What guys guys? What do you think has been the

01:50.400 --> 01:57.200
biggest bombshell of this year's E3 that is definitely happening now and not several days

01:57.200 --> 02:02.960
in the future and not us recording on the Wednesday before? Yeah, it's a good question

02:02.960 --> 02:09.600
and one that made a lot of sense coming out of the of the mouth. I'm for me. I mean during

02:09.600 --> 02:13.680
the Sony press conference crash Bandicoot's weird shorts fell down and we saw his big fuzzy balls.

02:15.440 --> 02:20.160
Wait and that was your biggest E3 like reveal. Do you think that's my most that's my most

02:20.160 --> 02:24.160
anticipated reveal and I gotta say Sony as they always do. They fucking followed through with

02:24.160 --> 02:29.840
those falling down. Show me those big furry nuts. That's really delivered to. Yeah, that's

02:29.840 --> 02:37.520
but those are not the nuts of a young being appropriate. Well aged nuts. He's been around

02:37.520 --> 02:43.520
the block big big big beautiful nuts though. I did like when the nuts are revealed and

02:43.520 --> 02:48.400
banjo-kazooie from the side of the stage just yelled they both in unison just yelled like nice

02:48.400 --> 02:53.520
nice nice nuts. You know the funny thing about it is it really with the games in a new perspective

02:53.520 --> 03:01.520
for me because the way he is spinning and gesticulating and jumping and running that can't

03:01.520 --> 03:07.120
have provided ball comfort. Yeah that had to be really unpleasant for the balls. They tried to

03:07.120 --> 03:12.800
do a fun thing where his mask friend floated down to like try to cover up the nuts but it wasn't

03:12.800 --> 03:17.520
fast enough. I definitely saw the nuts. I thought what was weird what was weird about the whole

03:17.520 --> 03:23.520
experience is that Carlos Bandicoot didn't even like seem fazed like it's not so revealed and he

03:23.520 --> 03:28.960
just stood there like kind of shrugging like yep that the hardest part about it for me was not the

03:28.960 --> 03:35.360
reveal of the nuts because I thought that was tasteful and on-brand but for the when he went

03:35.360 --> 03:41.920
for 20 minutes afterwards just going what do you think what do you think I mean the audience

03:41.920 --> 03:46.960
the audience ate it up though and I did think it was a little bit sad maybe uh when later

03:46.960 --> 03:53.280
Ratchet and Clank came out there and then Clank revealed like big metal nuts um and not like

03:53.280 --> 03:59.120
sorry it's not like a fun sort of hardware nuts but actual like metal balls like testicles but

03:59.120 --> 04:03.920
they were made in a lab they were made a lab in there but then Clank was just like is this what

04:03.920 --> 04:11.680
you got is this whatever does everyone like this and then um Sony announced Shenmue 4 yeah which is

04:11.680 --> 04:18.480
wild it was so sick I was so excited this one is all forklifts also Sonic the Hedgehog Origins

04:19.280 --> 04:24.880
in which he is very slow for the first 90% of the game and he gets hit by lightning or something

04:24.880 --> 04:31.120
something we don't know we don't know what I thought was great was at the end yeah remember

04:31.120 --> 04:36.240
the screen went black and you're like well that's it and then they were like just one more thing

04:36.240 --> 04:42.640
and then Kratos it showed Kratos and he was like I've got nuts too and he started to peel it away

04:43.200 --> 04:50.080
and then it was like black screen coming in 2018 and it's like I yeah yeah I'm on board to see

04:50.080 --> 04:58.880
Kratos's nuts in 11 years yeah it's coming in a lot in a while Travis when do you think 2018 is

04:58.880 --> 05:03.040
Travis oh I thought you said for some reason I heard 2028 I don't know why it's different that

05:03.040 --> 05:08.960
would be quite the dev cycle well Justin it takes a while to get the right texture mapping

05:08.960 --> 05:16.800
do you want half ass balls I'm sorry Justin do you want half ass balls is that what is going on with

05:16.800 --> 05:23.040
with Gordon with my man Gordon is Gabe just trying to get the balls my new gun in this one

05:23.040 --> 05:30.960
is balls he's just got perfect physics laden balls worth the wait and what's weird is they also

05:30.960 --> 05:38.000
revealed uh saints row five very tasteful no nudity no balls they were like now everyone's

05:38.000 --> 05:44.960
doing balls it's an it's a children's edgy game it is fucking weird it's so weird they were like

05:44.960 --> 05:51.520
you know what we've pushed the boundary we've come back around the other side now very tasteful

05:51.520 --> 05:58.400
uh like a downton abbey-esque kind of game from the people at saints row and what's and it's great

05:58.400 --> 06:02.400
the next dragon age announced that too they're doing like a pokemon red blue version one where

06:02.400 --> 06:07.120
there's a version with lots of huge balls on all the dragons and on everybody and then there's one

06:07.120 --> 06:12.960
where it's more um pure I guess and the balls are much more tasteful balls anything any other

06:12.960 --> 06:18.880
funny things we can say about video games balls something about mario's balls I don't think that's

06:18.880 --> 06:23.840
pretty careless that's well trod at this point he has those things out for anybody that'll ask

06:24.400 --> 06:32.160
that wouldn't have been a reveal at all um so I had yeah what I didn't like was seeing madden's

06:32.160 --> 06:39.600
balls again it's like every year we have it's like ea feels like they have to show us man's balls

06:39.600 --> 06:45.280
and it's like we get it they're the same balls as last year but they look a little bit better now I

06:45.280 --> 06:50.160
don't know how that arc is working by the way whatever madden is doing for those bad boys is

06:50.160 --> 06:56.720
working for him uh I will say I did appreciate that they finally just like you know just admitted

06:56.720 --> 07:02.080
the truth and just called it what it is and announced the new ball of duty game okay and

07:02.080 --> 07:10.400
that's it that's the logical terminus there's our stop boop boop everybody off uh on this show we

07:10.400 --> 07:16.000
talk about video game characters balls but also sometimes give advice in between so I'd like to

07:16.000 --> 07:21.280
get right to it about a year ago I went to a party at my friend's new place during the event I walked

07:21.280 --> 07:26.960
straight through the screen door oh oh man oh about 20 minutes later another party goer did

07:26.960 --> 07:36.080
the exact same thing and the door was ruined that's true okay hold on uh I'll get to the

07:36.080 --> 07:39.760
science a second door's ruined now one year later my friend's roommate is asking me to pay for the

07:39.760 --> 07:44.320
replacement of the door as they move out what should I do I caused the damage but so did the

07:44.320 --> 07:48.480
other guy isn't this past the statute of limitations and that's from egregious door

07:48.480 --> 07:53.360
smasher in Everett Washington okay so what I don't understand is how you walked through the

07:53.360 --> 08:02.000
screen door yet left enough more enough for somebody else to penetrate like you took down

08:02.000 --> 08:05.840
you took down a couple cubes of the don't break the ice but then somebody else came in and finished

08:05.840 --> 08:12.480
the fight it sounds like maybe a little bit perhaps person a the question asker is on the

08:12.480 --> 08:17.520
shorter side so when they walk through they tore out like one side and the bottom I see I see I see

08:17.520 --> 08:24.480
person two is much taller and they took out the top section um I will say if two folks in one night

08:24.480 --> 08:30.320
walk through the same screen door that is a design failure on part of the door maybe the mesh was too

08:30.320 --> 08:36.960
fine you're lucky it didn't just like grate you you could have walked into it and just come out

08:36.960 --> 08:42.160
the other side like play-doh spaghetti cube two hyper cubed right there all over the floor and

08:42.160 --> 08:45.840
then that's another thing they have to pay that's coming out of the damage deposit is that there's

08:45.840 --> 08:53.440
just cubes of Brian all over um I as far as the statute of limitations that gets so tricky because

08:53.440 --> 08:58.880
this is the type of thing that like it happens and it's at a party and you had a few Beverly's

08:58.880 --> 09:03.120
and you look over and your friend fucking Kool-Aid man smashes through your screen door and it's

09:03.120 --> 09:06.240
very very funny and then when it's time to move out you look at that same screen door and you're

09:06.240 --> 09:13.920
like oh yeah we have to pay for that and so I think it comes up again um well but Griffin I

09:13.920 --> 09:19.200
would say that the statute of limitations for this is the 20 minutes it took for the next person to

09:19.200 --> 09:24.240
walk through it because if you separated that out longer if you're like yeah I ran into my friend's

09:24.240 --> 09:29.120
screen door and then three months later someone else did it and like it was completely demolished

09:29.120 --> 09:33.680
at that point you wouldn't be like okay well you're both responsible now I would say like

09:33.680 --> 09:38.720
wait hold on that is that person's responsible I may have started it but they definitely finished

09:38.720 --> 09:45.680
it yeah but you could make the argument that it was you who necessitated the fixing in the first

09:45.680 --> 09:50.640
place you normal you normalize the process of of Hulk smashing through the screen door your

09:50.640 --> 09:54.800
friends saw you do it was like I well I guess it's okay I guess everybody's smashing the screen

09:54.800 --> 10:01.840
door policy here um fuck at the same time though I can't imagine how funny this was and I think

10:01.840 --> 10:07.120
that that pays for itself like yeah I gotta you know I gotta dish out like 70 bucks or whatever

10:07.120 --> 10:12.160
to fix the door but um I had 70 bucks worth of laughter and funny story do y'all remember when

10:12.160 --> 10:17.680
I did this at uncle Dave's uncle Dave's house we were we were over at our uncle Dave's house

10:17.680 --> 10:27.520
down in Florida and um this was this was a fucking decade ago and I saw a golf cart out in his driveway

10:27.520 --> 10:33.440
and I saw it and I guess I thought in my mind I was gonna go and hop in the golf cart and like

10:33.440 --> 10:39.680
do a few laps around the community uh and I said out loud Grand Theft Auto and look at referencing

10:39.680 --> 10:44.720
the game not the crime and I just went right through the fucking thing and to me it was really

10:44.720 --> 10:50.160
really funny and that but uncle Dave got pretty upset and then later on I called I called uncle

10:50.160 --> 10:54.480
Dave to apologize but I could not stop laughing over the phone and so I do not think the apology

10:54.480 --> 10:59.600
was accepted or believed it's very funny to watch somebody do this because it's a door doors are

10:59.600 --> 11:05.360
supposed to keep this from happening and when it doesn't it is very very hysterical yes we'll pay

11:05.360 --> 11:11.920
for it fine we'll do it fine send us a bill voice and we'll and we'll take care of it clarify

11:11.920 --> 11:18.240
just that clear itemized we need an itemized invoice itemized invoice labor not too expensive

11:18.240 --> 11:22.640
get somebody who knows what they're doing can I do a real quick yahoo and then a better yahoo

11:22.640 --> 11:27.200
yeah I'd love that this quick one is like it took me on a journey it was sent by Seth Carlson thank

11:27.200 --> 11:34.000
you Seth yahoo answers user exciting nine who asks um I thought Obama was supposed to make the

11:34.000 --> 11:39.520
commercials on tv be the same volume as the shows what happened to this commercials commercials are

11:39.520 --> 11:48.640
still like twice as loud as shows to me this makes him a lame duck president pretty busted um metric

11:48.640 --> 11:56.640
this is very funny huh so the FCC actually did a thing they passed a bill in 2010 called the

11:56.640 --> 12:03.360
calm act the commercial advertisement loudness mitigation act where you get a penalty if you if

12:03.360 --> 12:13.360
you fucking go from like oh Deborah oh my mom's come over again we got new spaghetti come on down

12:13.360 --> 12:19.040
and get this spaghetti if you do that you get fined like a bunch of money but it doesn't seem

12:19.040 --> 12:25.920
to I guess this is one where they're just like how do you enforce that if somebody records it on

12:25.920 --> 12:31.840
their tv and then they send you the tv recording of the spaghetti crime and then the channel gets

12:31.840 --> 12:38.080
the channel gets blasted they must be just the profit margins on the spaghetti must just be so

12:38.080 --> 12:44.480
good it's like whatever it takes just blaze it I would also I would also just like to jump in here

12:44.480 --> 12:52.480
um before anybody tweets or anything that's also just not what lame duck means in any political

12:52.480 --> 12:58.800
content that's just because you didn't accomplish something doesn't make you a lame duck that's a

12:58.800 --> 13:05.840
very specific thing um anyways just wanted to clarify that I like this idea of like I thought

13:05.840 --> 13:12.880
he said he was gonna clean up the streets well lame duck mayor this is this is since having a

13:12.880 --> 13:18.800
uh a baby who goes to sleep at like six o'clock this is my this is probably the most pressing

13:18.800 --> 13:25.680
concern for me now which is me and me and rachel are watching the big bang theory just like quietly

13:25.680 --> 13:31.120
chuckling like fighting the earth should just scream a good cackle out what did he say about

13:31.120 --> 13:40.800
the flesh yeah so he's like he's like he's like uh captain mccard and cling on then dr who and

13:41.760 --> 13:53.520
board games and then it's just like pepsi's got it just like scream like like fucking tyrese just

13:53.520 --> 14:00.880
like shows up on the on my screen for pepsi and he's just like pepsi's got it screaming and it

14:00.880 --> 14:07.280
knocks all of the pictures off my walls on my house and all i just replaced all the windows

14:07.280 --> 14:14.400
in the house and those have exploded and the baby the baby's crib like collapses like a cartoon like

14:14.400 --> 14:18.160
all the wood falls apart we i believe have touched on this in a previous episode but i'd love to

14:18.160 --> 14:23.600
circle around about it now that you all are in this situation how miserable are tv shows and i'm

14:23.600 --> 14:28.800
looking at you twin peaks i hate to to drag you on this how miserable are tv shows where

14:28.800 --> 14:35.280
dialogue is mixed to the quietest possible volume and every single footfall is like a thousand

14:35.280 --> 14:39.680
megaton bomb just i just i do want to say it's interesting that you would single out twin peaks

14:39.680 --> 14:46.800
where the dialogue to no dialogue ratio is like pretty astounding one percent dialogue but yes

14:46.800 --> 14:53.920
i do agree that especially if there's any kind of supernatural or fantasy element fucking dragons are

14:53.920 --> 15:00.480
the worst like can we please level eight those dragons please when we when we were rewatching

15:00.480 --> 15:08.720
buffy we're almost done thank christ um every time she smokes one of those vampos that sound effect

15:08.720 --> 15:14.400
was josh was in the studio just like crank that shit did the dust sound effect fucking

15:14.400 --> 15:20.480
pop that shit i hate vampires fucking crank it it's like i'm gonna i'm gonna kick you really

15:20.480 --> 15:29.600
hard vampire i will see about that i'm gonna bite your neck first stab like come on guys please

15:30.160 --> 15:34.160
i think about that teresa and i we watched parks and rec just like on loop

15:34.880 --> 15:40.960
and it's always the same thing with the intro music and it's like hey local local government

15:40.960 --> 15:52.480
joke let's so what do we do we need the sequel to the calm act the calmer act as proposed by

15:52.480 --> 15:57.760
the mackeroy brothers so that their babies so their babies cribs don't explode when the pepsi

15:57.760 --> 16:02.560
commercial comes on let me let me propose this what if it said there's just a service where like

16:02.560 --> 16:07.120
somebody comes to your house and they just ride the volume button like they're just there they're

16:07.120 --> 16:15.840
not enjoying the thing at all they're just like mute ah yes ah damn it um anyway this is the thing

16:15.840 --> 16:23.920
i thought i saw this question i was like another goofball on yahoo being a silly billy but no i

16:23.920 --> 16:29.120
mean this wasn't obama's jurisdiction i don't think but there was there's a law about this

16:29.120 --> 16:34.640
that apparently this is just one of those laws like many laws that you can just be like no we're

16:34.640 --> 16:40.400
just gonna keep doing doing it i have an idea i have an idea you're gonna love that everybody's

16:40.400 --> 16:49.840
gonna love this it is a way more enforceable law pass a law all commercials the voiceover work has

16:49.840 --> 16:56.480
to be done by roman mars oh i love this you're welcome i was just telling roman mars yesterday

16:56.480 --> 17:03.040
that i'm gonna load up like an mp3 player and just play it like on a loop uh of 99 invisible

17:03.040 --> 17:09.120
in my baby's room so that she will both learn um to speak eloquently but also like not get

17:09.120 --> 17:16.480
woken up by big spikes of like yelling i gotcha i gotcha can i pitch you a different idea yes

17:16.480 --> 17:22.320
a new law that says that every line of dialogue on every tv show from now on has to be screamed

17:22.320 --> 17:27.360
at the top of your lungs and because then even that would normalize it even then i could i could

17:27.360 --> 17:32.880
turn my volume down to a regular volume so that when tyrese is like pepsi's got it and it gets

17:32.880 --> 17:39.440
back and it's like mike did you drop the car off with the mechanic no molly i forgot damn it mike

17:39.440 --> 17:44.480
that's from mike and molly uh classic scene from mike and molly i think that would solve

17:44.480 --> 17:49.840
the problem too okay wait wait alternate alternate government next up on tonight's show we got the

17:49.840 --> 17:56.640
weekend how about all commercials are voiced by roman mars but also all parts and all tv shows

17:56.640 --> 18:07.440
are played by roman mars i would do that 88 some mars adr no no no he plays every part oh um the

18:07.440 --> 18:18.640
one who knocks um he's gonna be busy he's gonna be very busy uh here's another question i park

18:18.640 --> 18:23.680
about 15 minutes away from work but i don't mind because it's a nice walk through a field last week

18:23.680 --> 18:31.040
i saw a teen planting a five-foot conifer when we made eye contact he got rather weird and hid

18:31.040 --> 18:36.800
around to the other side of it you gotta help me through this i walk past it every day now and i

18:36.800 --> 18:44.880
don't know why he hid ideas that's from confused about the conifer holy shit three possibilities

18:44.880 --> 18:53.840
okay y'all tell me what you think nymph dryad or some sort of satyr it's one of the it's definitely

18:53.840 --> 18:58.320
one of the three it's definitely supernatural definitely supernatural it's a nymph it's a

18:58.320 --> 19:04.400
nymph it's a dryad or it's a satyr it was the spirit of this tree one way or the other i mean

19:04.400 --> 19:10.960
whatever the the form it took is i think we can all agree that there's definitely you um this is

19:10.960 --> 19:16.960
a narnia ask mr tumness like invitation to go on our fantasy world but you had to get to work

19:16.960 --> 19:22.160
definitely tumness definitely tumness we're looking at full-on tumness find that tree got a

19:22.160 --> 19:27.920
hole put your head in the hole there you go down you go to the other world to the other one follow

19:27.920 --> 19:33.200
him follow the tumness always follow the tumness you always have to stop what you're doing drop

19:33.200 --> 19:37.440
what you're doing and follow the tumness 100 of the time gotta follow the tumness till you

19:37.440 --> 19:41.200
reach the terminus that's what i've always said do you know how many tumness opportunities like

19:41.200 --> 19:46.480
how many people get tumness opportunities in this life not many not many i've never i've

19:46.480 --> 19:50.800
never fucking had one but if i did you can bet i would drop what i was doing stop what i was doing

19:50.800 --> 19:57.360
and go get that tumness that's it i did once oh shit yeah i mean time didn't pass the same for

19:57.360 --> 20:02.320
you guys so i yeah i was only gone for like five minutes but from my view i was gone for 25 years

20:02.320 --> 20:09.520
and that's um when i learned french um and and cross stitching um you forgot the you forgot the

20:09.520 --> 20:14.240
french i forgot the french part um i didn't learn it great i learned it like high school learned it

20:14.240 --> 20:20.560
you know enough to pass um but that was it i actually um now looking back in retrospect i

20:20.560 --> 20:26.080
probably could have spent more time away from tumness exploring narnia mostly i just hung out

20:26.080 --> 20:31.920
with tumness cross stitching and speaking french so on the on the off chance this is in a tumness

20:31.920 --> 20:39.040
scenario the only other explanation is that look when you're a teen you're almost always looking

20:39.040 --> 20:48.160
for places to make out or smoke weed and so this person was probably planting a lovely tree

20:48.160 --> 20:55.440
just to have one more spot in the world where they could go and have some some sneaky some sneak

20:55.440 --> 21:00.000
time a little bit of sneak time okay like there's there's not enough places there's not enough little

21:00.000 --> 21:07.600
shadowy spots and um you know elements to break line of sight in this field that he likes to

21:09.280 --> 21:15.360
get blazed or make kisses in and so they planted this tree to have like a little zone a little them

21:15.360 --> 21:19.840
zone i really like this forward thinking that you're pitching here griffin where they planted

21:19.840 --> 21:25.680
uh what a five foot tall tree yep and and thought man in a hundred years i'm really gonna enjoy

21:25.680 --> 21:31.360
smoking weed behind well travis what are they gonna do carry a massive redwood into this

21:31.360 --> 21:36.240
field no they're right you're right you're right you know what i was wrong and you were right um i

21:36.240 --> 21:41.280
do also want to say question asker it's also quite possible that what you were witnessing appeared

21:41.280 --> 21:47.120
to be a teen planting a tree but was in fact a teen contemplating stealing a tree

21:47.120 --> 21:56.960
hmm and you foiled it i want to i like to i'd like to go back and pitch the visual mental picture of

21:56.960 --> 22:05.600
an 80 year old person taking another person into a big field where a big tall proud conifer is there

22:05.600 --> 22:11.200
and he goes up and puts his hand on the tree and tells the story of how he planted it and how he

22:11.200 --> 22:15.360
always been waiting for this moment more or less his entire life and then he just pulls out the

22:15.360 --> 22:22.640
biggest duper and is like all right let's party it's time grandson it's time to do this damn thing

22:23.440 --> 22:29.760
i planted this smoke tree for you for us this is our family legacy

22:32.320 --> 22:42.320
um oh i was so hoping whoa we got a haunted doll watch oh it's been forever i feel like haunted

22:42.320 --> 22:49.120
doll watch has been thoroughly munched by the munch squad let me blow the dust off the tome yeah

22:51.360 --> 22:58.160
haunted doll janet very high emf uh i'm gonna go ahead and skype you all a link if you're

22:58.160 --> 23:03.360
playing at home you can feel free to google don't read ahead please i would ask you can

23:03.360 --> 23:09.040
just enjoy the pictures of haunted doll jen very active hi i gotta say she's got um

23:09.040 --> 23:15.200
um a lot of just a lot of hair and what looks like some mardi gras beads sort of

23:15.200 --> 23:20.320
that's binding her the first fun thing is that she's been bound by mardi gras beads in this one

23:21.040 --> 23:27.840
janet is an active essence she is enjoyed mostly in the early morning hours at just at sunset

23:27.840 --> 23:35.760
ill the tilapia may i recommend a janet this one has been aged for many years she prefers

23:35.760 --> 23:40.480
to be why do you like run out of bed every morning you don't understand my janet is

23:40.480 --> 23:45.200
best in the early morning hours and oh you want to catch janet you gotta get up before

23:45.760 --> 23:51.760
early bird gets the spooky doll she prefers to be away from a window but what's a view to the

23:51.760 --> 24:01.040
outside enjoy this periscope janet fuck off you're about to feel bad i feel that this is because her

24:01.040 --> 24:06.880
essence was shut away during her life and was warned against being seen by outsiders parentheses

24:06.880 --> 24:15.920
maybe hiding during world war i mean fucking maybe a big swing yeah just take a shot at it

24:16.560 --> 24:23.680
uh when i put it on a show maybe against the devil when i put her on the shelf maybe like in

24:23.680 --> 24:28.800
maybe she was trapped in a cupboard like indian in the cupboard you don't know you don't know when i

24:28.800 --> 24:32.880
put her on a shelf with other vessels the next morning she would be on the floor she doesn't

24:32.880 --> 24:37.200
like to be around other people well that sounds more like a problem with the other dolls being

24:37.200 --> 24:45.680
bullies communicating with her was ellipses fluid it's so natural what does that mean just

24:45.680 --> 24:54.960
natural sweaty janet are you feeling this i gave this this early morning vibe i gained my insights

24:54.960 --> 25:01.760
by sitting with her over a l-o-n-g hyphenated period of time it's high it's it's heightening

25:01.760 --> 25:06.960
the longness of this period of time and allowing the conceptualization to enter my consciousness

25:07.840 --> 25:13.120
with my other dolls the feeling i got from them was singular i would get a strong feeling over

25:13.120 --> 25:18.640
time much like you sit quietly in the wilderness and begin to hear sounds that you did not pick up

25:18.640 --> 25:25.840
immediately you experience the tapestry as a gestalt rather than focusing on any individual

25:25.840 --> 25:30.960
threads within the tapestry it was in these times that she would be the most active with me

25:32.000 --> 25:36.480
janet doll is made from porcelain and i believe it is five feet there's no reality

25:40.080 --> 25:46.480
what the fuck there's a picture there's a picture of it standing next to a thing of incense that it

25:46.480 --> 25:53.600
is as big as is this a five foot novelty incense stick well i do want okay two things one go to

25:53.600 --> 25:57.840
this and look at the pictures because what i love is you get one picture of doll by yourself and then

25:57.840 --> 26:05.040
two separate pictures of the uh incense candle picture as if they're like which one of these

26:05.040 --> 26:10.560
do you think is best you know what i'll do both both and then secondly justin that was very

26:10.560 --> 26:18.160
charitable of you in describing what janet doll is made from um because you said porcelain when in

26:18.160 --> 26:25.040
fact the material that they claim is procalian procalian is a new material um that we're we're

26:25.040 --> 26:31.120
all really excited about the new tesla models are mostly procalian this is um not five feet tall

26:31.120 --> 26:36.560
that's correct it's not a fucking in any way it's not a fucking blockbuster cardboard stand-up of

26:36.560 --> 26:42.320
the rock okay it's like little doll this is such false advertising that i believe this person could

26:42.320 --> 26:48.960
actually go to jail for how much how bad they whiffed this size estimation um also just real

26:48.960 --> 26:53.040
quick starting bid 95 bucks or buy it now for 150 you know i don't want to stress about it

26:53.040 --> 27:06.400
three folks watching oh that's us there's i don't like to stress out i don't want to put the 95 in

27:06.400 --> 27:12.240
you pay an extra 65 bucks for the 150 buy it now but just the peace of mind that it brings me is

27:12.240 --> 27:17.200
so worth it so i can have this in my door estimated between wednesday june 14th and

27:17.200 --> 27:22.720
monday june 19th like fucking like yeah all right let's do it i'm gonna pull the trigger

27:23.360 --> 27:28.480

28:25.840 --> 28:30.320

cute hey can i do a yahoo now yep is it good yeah lots lots and lots and lots of people

35:02.080 --> 35:07.280
sent this one in thank you everyone seriously i think like six people so an anonymous yahoo user

35:08.160 --> 35:17.120
um say janet asks how do you avoid getting water up your rear when going on certain water slides

35:17.760 --> 35:21.680
update update update like the really steep fast ones with lots of water pressure

35:23.360 --> 35:30.480
i i think everybody's sort of got their own way of dealing with this um me i've started to sort

35:30.480 --> 35:39.280
of work with a kind of hydrophobic um tight sort of unders undersuit that i wear under my swimsuit

35:39.280 --> 35:47.120
so smart that keeps everything just like gunpowder dry and so like it's not even it's hydrophobic so

35:47.120 --> 35:52.240
like i'm going in the water from the water slide it's like let me get in that rear end but my

35:52.240 --> 35:57.440
my undershorts are just like think think about it again i'm very afraid of you you know what i mean

35:57.440 --> 36:02.560
when you go down the water slide the water goes it just naturally wants to snake up there

36:03.520 --> 36:08.560
and i guess i'm asking like how you don't how you don't maybe get it

36:10.560 --> 36:18.880
two scrunchies two scrunchies hold the trunks oh the trunks for the trunk's legs closed you know

36:18.880 --> 36:22.480
what i mean i'm turning into a kind of a they'll kind of look like a pantaloon i think at that

36:22.480 --> 36:27.360
point yeah that would look kind of nice and then you and then you also have a sort of tourniquet

36:27.360 --> 36:32.720
situation which is good if like one of your something happens to the legs that's possible

36:32.720 --> 36:37.760
on a water slide you could just do what i did what did you did uh what i did was i just had

36:37.760 --> 36:52.560
skin grafted over my butthole so no no not yet okay not yet not yet just like permanently sealed it

36:54.960 --> 37:02.160
just in case of water slides i now will say travis this is a lot of folks here this thing

37:02.160 --> 37:08.880
what a crass joke travis is his biggest tube junkie i ever met he loves those big wet tubes and he goes

37:08.880 --> 37:18.800
down them all the time so like if somebody were to kind of like water world uh kurt costner got

37:18.800 --> 37:23.040
the gills put in just because he swims all the time like travis gets on those wet tubes all the

37:23.040 --> 37:30.000
time and so like he does need like a a practical um easy solution let me be clear it is not

37:30.000 --> 37:34.800
the only modification i've made i mean my whole butt cracker is now smooth it's one whole cheek

37:34.800 --> 37:41.280
i've also had the points of my elbows and knees shaved down to help with my arrow uh die

37:41.280 --> 37:50.400
uh you know aerodynamics uh dynamicism yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i think aqua dynamics is what you're

37:50.400 --> 37:54.880
thinking of because it's not just it's not just you don't just gotta seal up the craft you want

37:54.880 --> 38:02.560
it to go as fast as is possible on those tubes my arms are permanently bound to my sides oh wow

38:02.560 --> 38:07.760
yeah no listen um and i also shaved my eyebrows off so like there's a lot of steps what's the

38:07.760 --> 38:18.160
eyebrows for just for looks um do you think if you got trunks tattooed on they would let you go

38:18.160 --> 38:30.240
on they would let you go down naked oh say it again if you got trunks or a you know bikini

38:30.240 --> 38:35.600
bottoms or one piece of whatever tattooed on do you think they would let you go down naked

38:36.960 --> 38:40.560
if you have a tattoo i i wish i could say no but

38:40.560 --> 38:44.240
it does look like you're wearing trunks i can't tell any difference

38:44.240 --> 38:50.240
yeah you know what i'm gonna say go ahead i'm gonna let it go i'm a 17 year old he doesn't care

38:50.240 --> 38:56.880
so sure fuck it and i'm crash bandicoot and i'm ready to slide you must be wearing some

38:56.880 --> 39:04.080
sort of trunks because i can't see any kind of butt crack yeah yeah exactly oh my god he's so fast

39:04.080 --> 39:08.560
holy shit all right three two one and go and you're out what how did that what

39:08.560 --> 39:12.480
you there was another kid in the slide you shot through them what the fuck

39:13.680 --> 39:18.160
uh a fun thing to do when you get on a water slice the last thing you should say the person is

39:18.160 --> 39:22.880
time me and then they'll feel like oh how am i supposed to get this information to him actually

39:22.880 --> 39:27.120
yeah time him with none of that stuff and then another fun thing just before you get in the

39:27.120 --> 39:33.680
water slide yeah like the window's about to close i have to go now yeah jump in but then just before

39:33.680 --> 39:38.800
you reach the bottom kind of pin your arms to the sides so like you hold yourself in place so when

39:38.800 --> 39:44.080
the person's looking you don't come out the bottom you must have slid and now they're remembering

39:44.080 --> 39:48.320
sliders and how much they love and how much they love that show i really don't want them to be

39:48.320 --> 39:59.600
distracted though it's an important job they have yeah um wow i think it's okay i think it's okay

39:59.600 --> 40:05.920
for a little water to go up yeah it can be nice can be good it's like a bidet it's just like a

40:05.920 --> 40:13.360
bidet one time when i was a little kid we were at a water park outdoor maybe the one at king's

40:13.360 --> 40:21.200
island if that was if that was extra yeah yeah yeah uh and i was so thirsty oh no for whatever

40:21.200 --> 40:28.560
reason our parents wouldn't buy me a drink and i don't know why maybe they were too expensive or i

40:28.560 --> 40:33.760
don't know why but i have maybe they didn't love you maybe they didn't care whether it was they

40:33.760 --> 40:39.840
they they had just bought me a drink and so like they were just kind of tired uh can i show griffins

40:39.840 --> 40:48.800
absolutely not what a dumb question uh so i slid down a water slide and at the bottom of the slide

40:48.800 --> 40:56.480
slid down a water slide and at the bottom of the water slide i forced myself when i landed in the

40:56.480 --> 41:03.600
splash pool i forced myself to take a big gulp of water oh my god this is the most viscerally

41:03.600 --> 41:08.640
upsetting like i'm not joking the most upsetting thing that has been discussed on this episode so

41:08.640 --> 41:14.160
far and more so than travis's like butthole modifications now let me ask it's the whole

41:14.160 --> 41:21.840
crack griffin let me ask you this one time i was leaving new york and i went to the wrong airport

41:22.480 --> 41:29.760
and i realized at the last moment and hop back in the cab and paid the guy to as like a private car

41:29.760 --> 41:34.960
like he was also moonlighting for carmel so i asked him to like i will pay you to take me to

41:34.960 --> 41:38.960
newark and i was at laguardia and he was like well it's gonna be tight making it there and he

41:38.960 --> 41:43.680
just floored it and i realized that i was planning on getting a drink at the airport and hadn't

41:43.680 --> 41:48.880
drank anything all day and i was thirstier than i've ever been in my entire life except for the

41:48.880 --> 41:56.720
time that i drank water out of a splash splash water park and i noticed in the door of the cab

41:56.720 --> 42:04.960
someone left half a water bottle um there and i did pick it up and drink it because i was so

42:04.960 --> 42:10.320
thirsty now my question to you is this wait wait hold on sealed water bottle already open no half

42:10.320 --> 42:16.000
empty i said half empty okay that would have been quite the fucking feat um so what's worse

42:16.720 --> 42:19.920
one of them didn't have other people bathing and lounging around and splashing around with

42:19.920 --> 42:25.440
their kids and having fun and playing that one's chlorinated though here's the thing

42:25.440 --> 42:32.640
justin have you thought about that your entire life after drinking from the wave pool has been

42:32.640 --> 42:41.280
a lie a few fever state brought on by the consuming of that horrible poison and everything now is your

42:42.080 --> 42:50.000
like your brain just giving you images to cover up for your like pool water coma like i'm still

42:50.000 --> 42:57.360
there in the pool yeah and all of this has just been like kind of an oracle at delphi kind of

42:57.360 --> 43:03.600
warp forward like you're you breathed in the vapors and now you're able to see time in all

43:03.600 --> 43:10.160
of its many forms and facets well i mean possible but you have to assume then at that point that

43:10.160 --> 43:16.720
i've been kept alive in stasis in the wave pool this entire time so yeah like a precog people

43:16.720 --> 43:21.200
are just splash downing around oh watch out for the little tubby guy hold on let me float him

43:21.200 --> 43:27.440
over to the other side darn it he's helping tom cruise solve mysteries you gotta watch out for

43:27.440 --> 43:34.400
him darn it grab the umbrella what did he say drop the nickels what did he say what is he saying

43:34.400 --> 43:40.560
i couldn't hear him over the water slide it's only he's a precog but he only can sense um

43:41.280 --> 43:46.880
uh waterslide park crime yeah like that there should be more cheese in there it's supposed to

43:46.880 --> 43:51.600
be three fourths of the way filled up on those nachos he's starting to wake up out of it but

43:51.600 --> 43:56.240
we haven't solved this crime here quick give him that gross bottle of water and get him back into

43:56.240 --> 44:02.080
it it's a re that's a that's a refill collectible refill mug that he brought from home he didn't buy

44:02.080 --> 44:06.720
that today i'm a senior in high school my class has been pretty lame with the pranks so the other

44:06.720 --> 44:12.400
night i gathered up some friends and decided to fork the football field and that's stick plastic

44:12.400 --> 44:16.880
forks in it to spell some stuff or just be a nuisance we were doing well for about an hour

44:16.880 --> 44:20.960
when several cop cars pulled up and we had to drop everything and run i managed to escape but

44:20.960 --> 44:26.080
i left my sister's backpack behind i was using it to carry extra forks it's definitely been

44:26.080 --> 44:31.280
confiscated by now but she doesn't know i used it should i turn myself in and get her backpack back

44:31.280 --> 44:36.000
or should i be just the worst and pretend i have no idea where it went i risk being charged with

44:36.000 --> 44:39.760
trespassing because i was on school grounds at 1 a.m and ran from cops that's from perplexed

44:39.760 --> 44:45.600
prankster p.s i managed to write zag on him before we were chased off god not in our name

44:46.240 --> 44:52.560
taking the day the next day when everyone found the prank um there are photos i look forward to

44:52.560 --> 44:58.160
you later can i just say just uh personally i one of the things i really love about this is

44:58.880 --> 45:05.440
the idea of forking um is very funny to me um because it seems definitely like a nuisance

45:05.440 --> 45:11.760
but kind of like uh what uh well you know this could be worse okay uh let's pick up these 40

45:11.760 --> 45:17.360
plastic forks and go on about our lives uh probably not 40 probably hundreds probably

45:17.360 --> 45:22.000
hundreds and hundreds here's how you know if you're old if you hear this story and you're

45:22.000 --> 45:26.640
like ha nice you're probably not if you hear this story and you're like all that poor guy

45:26.640 --> 45:32.720
because there's some poor guy or lady that had to go in the next morning and just individually pluck

45:32.720 --> 45:38.480
forks out of the football field that's a rough day you know they've got a full load and now they've

45:38.480 --> 45:44.320
got to deal with your forks six kids spend one hour stabbing force into a football field that's

45:44.320 --> 45:50.640
going to take one adult six hours to remove all of the force of the football field it spells out

45:50.640 --> 45:58.160
zag on him what do you think it means it spells out zaggo name fucking kids i just don't know

45:58.160 --> 46:04.240

another ping matrix fingerprints were found on this jam sport it's the 16th one but we think

46:47.280 --> 46:52.880
this is a clue that's finally going to lead us to the truth it's a jam sport hold up hold up

46:52.880 --> 47:02.320
everybody hold up amazon.com and then we gonna type in the name of the backpack brand jansport

47:02.320 --> 47:08.720
backpack in luggage and travel gear this is fifteen dollars and eighty two cents come on

47:09.360 --> 47:14.080
should i go to jail or should i pay fifteen dollars and eighty two cents to get a new jansport

47:14.080 --> 47:20.160
a new fresh jansport with like no you don't you know how jansport in any backpack really

47:20.160 --> 47:24.800
just even if you never put food in it it gets food crumbles in the bottom of it at some point

47:25.440 --> 47:34.320
a fresh start no crumbles and also no crumbles but also no jail what if you went to the police of

47:34.320 --> 47:41.440
like the police station and you just incredibly dramatically threw yourself on the mercy of the

47:41.440 --> 47:48.880
officers in order to reclaim your sister's backpack just like very like i did it i was

47:48.880 --> 47:54.320
the one who zagged upon them and that is my sister's back how could i and like really just

47:54.320 --> 47:59.600
like tear your shirt gnashing your teeth my bet is they'll just hand you the backpack and tell you

47:59.600 --> 48:04.400
to leave because they're very busy no no fifteen dollars and eighty two cents eighty two cents to

48:04.400 --> 48:09.920
get out of this right the other option is you go and you think like oh it's just a harmless prank

48:09.920 --> 48:15.280
they are always always always casting for scared straight a hundred percent of the time they're

48:15.280 --> 48:20.720
casting for scared straight you go in there and you with your innocent cherubic i did a prank

48:20.720 --> 48:28.320
they're gonna it's gonna happen yeah they're gonna get you sorry on the show sorry you're on

48:28.320 --> 48:34.080
