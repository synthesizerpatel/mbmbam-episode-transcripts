WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists. He's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall. I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better, it's better with you

00:53.940 --> 00:55.940
It's better, it's better with you

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
It's better, it's better with you

01:09.940 --> 01:15.420
Hello everybody welcome to the party everybody get up inside a slam now

01:15.420 --> 01:19.860
We got my brother, my brother and me going now. Wake into the space jam

01:20.340 --> 01:22.340
It's your chance

01:22.340 --> 01:28.820
Now don't touch the back or just put it in the hoop. I'm Justin one of them's Travis one of them's Griffin. Listen

01:28.820 --> 01:30.300
Here's the thing

01:30.300 --> 01:32.300
Yeah, big dog. Yeah

01:32.940 --> 01:37.220
Here's the thing. Okay space jam did come out a week ago as the code flies

01:37.500 --> 01:44.060
As we're recording this a week ago and we fucked up because we accidentally did a whole episode about fucking lame-ass parties

01:44.060 --> 01:47.940
Yeah, and then I got off the call and as I was getting off the calls like oh my god

01:47.940 --> 01:54.500
We talked about space and not jam about it. We were so close because a fucking Jeff Bezos. Yeah

01:56.500 --> 01:59.420
Like he always does distracted us from the important

02:00.940 --> 02:08.140
Let's actually start there if I could okay, it's a new film space jam a new legacy which Griffin and I have enjoyed it

02:08.140 --> 02:15.460
I have yes, um and Travis has not partake in it has not partaken yet. I want to say one thing up front

02:15.460 --> 02:20.300
This is not part of talking about but like this why we haven't started talking about it

02:20.300 --> 02:22.300
We haven't this is this is the preamble

02:22.300 --> 02:27.880
This is the horse do verse to the conversation about why is it called space jam?

02:28.580 --> 02:30.580
Because they can't

02:31.380 --> 02:34.880
Not in this one space was in the first one if you remember

02:35.580 --> 02:37.060
cyberspace in it

02:37.060 --> 02:44.040
Now cyberspace jam would have been a much better name cyberspace jam is actually a fucking great name because cyberspace is in it

02:44.060 --> 02:48.260
Okay, Travis. I'm just gonna tell Griffin and I are gonna be telling you wild shit about this movie

02:48.260 --> 02:54.460
Okay, and I don't want to try to what you had pitched is like we would make things up. I don't even think

02:55.500 --> 02:58.120
We okay. I have the game. Are you ready for the game?

03:00.580 --> 03:05.220
Griffin and I are gonna tell you wild shit about space jam a new legacy

03:05.220 --> 03:13.540
Okay, but each wild thing we tell each other has to top the the wild previous thing of the previous thing

03:13.660 --> 03:19.500
Okay, so if we go deep in the paint too early and Travis if the other one can't come up with a wild thing that

03:19.580 --> 03:24.380
Tops the previous wild thing then we start a new round and you're the judge. Okay. Okay, great. Great. Okay

03:24.380 --> 03:28.140
So try and start low juice. There's a lot don't don't come at it with a

03:28.780 --> 03:32.980
Hot, okay. No, here's okay. Here's what we'll do. Here's how we make it fair, right?

03:32.980 --> 03:40.500
Justin well, whoever goes first right has to if the other person can't top there's top their own to show that it could have been

03:43.500 --> 03:47.040
Spelling be rules. Yes, we should also say that like

03:48.820 --> 03:50.820
Spoilers

03:51.460 --> 03:53.840
Industry now so like everybody worked really hard on this

03:58.940 --> 04:00.940
Jordan is in it

04:00.940 --> 04:03.540
But not that Michael Jordan

04:04.420 --> 04:06.420
What?

04:06.740 --> 04:07.940
It's a great gag

04:07.940 --> 04:14.280
I almost feel like this is the only the only spoilable thing about the film so like we did warn you at the top

04:14.280 --> 04:20.420
We warned you at the top. It's a fucking great gag. I like Michael B. Jordan or something. Yeah, but it's Michael B

04:20.420 --> 04:22.420
Jordan, it's so fucking funny

04:23.420 --> 04:29.540
Except for it does kind of lean into like some some unsettling things about the linden's perception of human beings

04:29.540 --> 04:33.880
Yeah, because they do think it is the Michael Jordan that they are dear friends with. Yeah, and spend

04:34.580 --> 04:42.260
Time with there's a codicil there where Sylvester says it has been 25 years which then sent me made me feel like a mummy

04:42.460 --> 04:44.460
Yeah, maybe feel like a old

04:45.780 --> 04:47.780
Griffin can you beat that?

04:48.060 --> 04:49.580
there's a

04:49.580 --> 04:51.580
matrix parody in which

04:52.220 --> 04:56.420
men shoot at Speedy Gonzales with deadly guns

04:56.420 --> 04:59.460
Weaponry they shoot realistic guns

05:00.420 --> 05:05.140
Bullets, I mean it's a it's essentially a clip from the matrix, but they did put

05:05.860 --> 05:11.420
You know what you speed round that whole sequence. Let's just ping pong it back and forth

05:11.420 --> 05:15.940
I take back my Speedy Gonzales being shot at because that is part for the course for the Looney Tunes

05:15.940 --> 05:18.780
I am going to say Travis there is a

05:19.220 --> 05:20.180
good

05:20.180 --> 05:26.660
Long chunk of Austin Powers in the travel good. There's like a good bit of Austin Powers in this one

05:26.660 --> 05:27.620
Yes

05:27.620 --> 05:33.140
Powers has been in the movie for about 20 years and it's in Space Jam because they go into like

05:33.420 --> 05:37.760
Do a scene of that they do a scene where they're in Austin Powers

05:38.020 --> 05:43.140
Yeah, Trav Trav trap that okay. So that was Griffin mine is they do a scene

05:43.140 --> 05:57.140
in the Mad Max, what? Mad Max, Ferry, Rebel Brawn and fucking Bugs are huffing paint and fucking chasing Valhalla

05:57.140 --> 06:03.140
Yeah and fucking Oily Coyote has a sign in his hand that says witness

06:03.540 --> 06:08.420
And listen, I saw a lot of haters out there saying wow, what a fucking

06:08.420 --> 06:15.340
Cash-in sellout the best. It's good. That's good stuff. It's so good

06:15.580 --> 06:20.340
It's so good. That's good that that happened. It's not bad that that happened

06:20.340 --> 06:24.300
It's actually good and I would say Looney Griffin top that

06:25.980 --> 06:27.980
God I mean, okay

06:28.020 --> 06:32.780
We could even start with John Cheadle is a cyber man who steals

06:32.780 --> 06:38.380
LeBron James's son and takes him to teach him that it's okay

06:38.380 --> 06:43.780
He's not good at basketball and that's okay to be good at video games. Yeah, that's a great lesson

06:44.820 --> 06:48.820
but it turns because then LeBron James's son is like

06:48.820 --> 06:55.860
I don't care if this leads to the destruction of mankind. I'm gonna beat my dad at cyber basketball

06:55.860 --> 07:00.940
So we're in a hook situation is what you're saying. Exactly. It's exactly a hook situation

07:00.940 --> 07:02.940
Does that top?

07:03.220 --> 07:07.980
Now Travis I have a question though was Griffin's thing an escalation or do I get a point?

07:07.980 --> 07:12.300
Well, I want to say Justin gets a point because the only way it would have been an escalation is if it was John

07:12.300 --> 07:18.740
Cheadle as Don Cheadle doing this. It's his name is algae rhythm. Uh-huh. Okay, we've discussed this

07:18.740 --> 07:21.460
We just we can't pretend like that's news to us

07:21.460 --> 07:26.380
We've discussed it on the show next round you start. Yeah, I start off. Okay

07:26.380 --> 07:30.980
Um, there's a rap battle with Porky Pig and

07:31.900 --> 07:36.460
Algae rhythm I say a rap battle. It's pretty one-sided. I don't think algae rhythm ever gets a hand on the ball

07:36.460 --> 07:42.220
Yeah, rads are weird. They're a rap battle where algae rhythm does not produce does not wrap and so wrecked by Porky Pig

07:45.380 --> 07:48.940
Probably but he comes at it with you expect him to be like the

07:49.660 --> 07:53.060
And like come at it with some like real rap God energy

07:53.060 --> 07:59.780
Yeah, some real twista energy, but it's very he raps very slow and bad

08:01.740 --> 08:09.020
Yeah, I was actually kind of getting pumped up because I felt like it would actually be kind of fun to watch Porky Pig

08:09.460 --> 08:10.860
absolutely

08:10.860 --> 08:12.860
destroy

08:15.420 --> 08:17.220
People like he does

08:17.220 --> 08:23.780
But he don't but it sucks. It sucks shit. They even do the like, you know the meme where the guys like kind of

08:23.940 --> 08:28.540
Reacting to the rap battle and and it's that one where he's like running across the screen with you know

08:28.540 --> 08:31.180
She saw it but they're acting like it's a very big

08:31.660 --> 08:36.680
Win when it is actually just like about as good as Porky Pig. I would think would do a rap

08:37.780 --> 08:39.940
What they should have done and I haven't seen it

08:39.940 --> 08:41.420
But maybe this does happen

08:41.420 --> 08:46.040
They should have instead had to be like a king speech thing where someone teaches Porky Pig not to stutter

08:46.040 --> 08:48.040
I think that's the whole movie. Yeah

08:48.380 --> 08:53.140
That would be way more exciting to me. Okay, I got I got one as long as we're keeping a little mile here

08:53.660 --> 08:55.380
LeBron

08:55.380 --> 09:01.820
The story is about LeBron as a father and he does have kids in it. Uh-huh, but they're not his kids

09:03.820 --> 09:05.220
They're made up

09:05.220 --> 09:10.540
They're made up kids that are based on his kids LeBron James has actual kids in real life. Yes

09:10.540 --> 09:17.060
They did not cast those kids. No, not only did they not cast those kids the names have been changed to fictional kids

09:17.140 --> 09:22.580
But LeBron does not have I see I see I see that's pretty weird, but I'm gonna say give Griffin that point

09:22.940 --> 09:29.220
Okay, because that's not super wild to me because I don't know if I got a chance to invent better versions of my kids

09:29.220 --> 09:34.300
It's not that my kids are great. Yeah, I take it. I'll give him my like I can understand the reasoning behind it

09:34.300 --> 09:38.460
It is a wild thing though. Griffin. Yeah any other ones just bump it around your head. Oh

09:38.460 --> 09:44.420
Oh god, I'll just drop one then cuz like I feel like the pace. Let's do just like lightning round

09:44.420 --> 09:49.740
It doesn't even have the top. It's just like whoever can't come up with a wild thing. Here's one trap

09:51.060 --> 09:53.420
Hey trap. Yeah, here's one. Yeah

09:54.300 --> 09:58.940
When LeBron and the Looney Tunes are playing in basketball

09:59.980 --> 10:05.940
The they are being watched by Voldemort and the look he'd Phoenix Joker. Wait

10:05.940 --> 10:11.140
Wait, what? Oh, okay, and I'm gonna take it one up top. Well, I'm gonna take I'm on one. Oh, wait

10:11.140 --> 10:13.140
You can't just say that

10:14.260 --> 10:17.540
And while they're playing basketball they are also being watched by

10:18.060 --> 10:21.800
The fucking dudes from Clockwork Orange is also in it

10:22.500 --> 10:28.500
Watching it and they're like we love basketball and it's like I don't I've I've never seen the Clockwork Orange film

10:28.500 --> 10:31.900
But I do believe those those gentlemen are quite quite rotten

10:31.900 --> 10:37.940
Uh, it's like watching videos though. I yeah seems a vaguely recalled that

10:38.300 --> 10:42.860
yeah, but in the in the stands in the audience because the premise is like

10:43.700 --> 10:48.360
That it's inside the servers of all of Warner Brothers

10:48.380 --> 10:51.340
So all their IP gets to come watch them play basketball

10:51.500 --> 10:55.340
So more a thinly veiled reference to like white supremacy

10:55.340 --> 11:01.180
Yeah, Nazi is it was like I would like to watch the basketball the more it's there though. Joe

11:01.180 --> 11:07.340
Call me Baltimore the serious murder Joker and not the fun Joe fun Joker

11:07.380 --> 11:11.940
They could have had fun Joker and but they do have fun penguin. How about that?

11:13.500 --> 11:16.220
Fuck yeah, but not Danny DeVito

11:16.940 --> 11:21.080
Well, that would have been abs now Travis that would have been even too wild for space

11:21.080 --> 11:27.140
Yeah, if that's that fish sucking monster had been there in the stands watching them get wild

11:28.340 --> 11:32.260
Fuck this fuck. Let's talk about the goon squad. Yeah

11:32.860 --> 11:34.860
so the goon squad is

11:35.740 --> 11:41.500
based on scans of actual players in the NBA and WNBA like the monster and

11:42.140 --> 11:44.020
but but

11:44.020 --> 11:47.420
They've been given they've been blended with other

11:47.420 --> 11:55.420
Things like us. There's a snake woman and a spider person and a guy who can turn into water and also fire

11:55.420 --> 12:02.060
and so they set all this up like oh this kid scan these players with his phone and now they've got

12:02.500 --> 12:08.840
Superpowers and that's the team and then about halfway through the game Don Cheadle's like but check out my

12:09.860 --> 12:14.240
Time-traveling robot that's also on the team and it's like who the

12:14.240 --> 12:18.580
Get ready for Kronos the basketball player who can freeze time

12:18.580 --> 12:23.360
It's like I thought everybody was based on actual players that had special props. No, okay

12:23.360 --> 12:28.240
We're just like a step line a hat on a hat where it's like I'm wearing a hat and I built a hat store on

12:28.240 --> 12:33.440
Top of yes and imagine Travis and Space Jam 1 if Swackhammer the big alien mean boss

12:33.440 --> 12:35.200
I was like this games not going the way I want

12:35.200 --> 12:40.600
I'm gonna eat some basketball power to get huge too cuz the algae rhythm does that and he's like fuck this

12:40.600 --> 12:46.320
I'm playing now and you get to see a huge muscle II just ripped Don Cheadle

12:47.080 --> 12:53.080
But you know, yeah, I understand that they play fast and loose with the rules these games, but that can't be allowed

12:53.080 --> 12:59.960
Oh, don't worry about it rules have gone completely out the fucking window the game at the end of Space Jam 2 is a disgrace

12:59.960 --> 13:02.040
To pass it's not it. Yeah, it's embarrassing

13:02.080 --> 13:09.520
It's like the scene in my ducks when the ducks get so funny and he's like that was actually too funny

13:09.520 --> 13:16.760
Yeah, and I'm back being Gordon Bombay the lawyer now, and I'm mad again. Yeah. Yeah now I'm mad at you guys juice

13:16.760 --> 13:22.560
I just did a few. I'm sorry. You know, it's all good. It's all good. I'm I got one for you Travis

13:22.560 --> 13:28.440
I got one for you. I should have mentioned that the Night King from gamer fans is also watching and play best, huh?

13:28.440 --> 13:33.560
They're having fun. Yeah, he's killed a lot of people. They're all there. They have a lot of murders in there, huh?

13:33.560 --> 13:42.280
Yeah, there's like a lot of fun. The internet says that Danny DeVito's penguin is actually I think he's I think I did see him

13:42.960 --> 13:48.560
So that penguin too, okay, but it's not Danny DeVito playing. It's like obviously not

13:48.560 --> 13:51.800
You probably didn't need to say that it's Manny Belvita

13:51.800 --> 14:01.360
Manny Belvita is what you get when you do like a fly experiment and accidentally cross Danny DeVito with a breakfast cookie

14:01.560 --> 14:03.400
Right, exactly. Yes

14:03.400 --> 14:08.200
Iron Giants in it, which is wild because he was also in the other one. You know what I mean?

14:08.200 --> 14:11.920
Yeah, yeah, they couldn't is a Vin Diesel in it as a

14:12.800 --> 14:14.800
No, that's Universal, isn't it?

14:15.520 --> 14:20.480
Listen listen, this is my biggest one. The Monstars are in it, but in their small

14:20.480 --> 14:22.640
supplicant

14:22.640 --> 14:24.640
Alien forms

14:25.800 --> 14:28.800
No, no, neither is but more importantly wait night

14:30.320 --> 14:31.760
No way

14:31.760 --> 14:36.880
Listen the little aliens from Space Jam 1 are in it, right and they're in the crowd

14:37.160 --> 14:45.260
Right when the goon squad does well and slams and smashes and just blasts the toon squad

14:45.260 --> 14:51.940
These little aliens go wild cheering and when the Looney Tunes start to win the basketball game

14:52.700 --> 14:59.740
The month these these little aliens who were the Monstars in Space Jam 1 get sad and disappointed

14:59.740 --> 15:04.300
No, that's bullshit. That's not cannon. That's not cannon at the end of Space Jam 1

15:04.300 --> 15:10.940
They like joined the Looney Tunes to live in toontown and be silly aliens and now you expect me to believe

15:10.940 --> 15:14.700
That they've turned it against them. They bet a lot of money

15:14.700 --> 15:18.940
They just bet a lot of money against because they're like we know that the Looney Tunes will win, right?

15:18.940 --> 15:23.300
So it's got to be long odds and they put a lot of money on the fucking goon squad

15:23.300 --> 15:27.260
I guess so it's not about person. It made me so angry to like

15:28.100 --> 15:35.320
No, Michael Jordan at no way night. Whatever like you can't get the folks. That's fine. But do you have you got this wrong?

15:35.320 --> 15:43.000
You undid all the work. You got this wrong. You did all the work and this is wrong. They love the Looney Tunes

15:43.960 --> 15:49.640
Trav, I just I just dropped a still in there just to get you like really worked up, huh?

15:49.640 --> 15:51.960
I just dropped a still in the slot. Oh shit

15:52.760 --> 15:56.520
Can you tell me who you see in this slot? Oh shit, just top of my head

15:56.520 --> 16:01.060
There's the mask and he's wearing what appears to be some sort of referee shirt. We have

16:01.060 --> 16:08.680
We've got Danny DeVito just poking his head over there's the Joker. Yeah, there's that looks like I'm gonna go with penguin

16:08.680 --> 16:12.680
Not the Joker. Oh, thank you. I'm gonna say that's agent J or agent K

16:14.560 --> 16:17.000
No, it's one of the matrix no

16:21.480 --> 16:25.000
There's there's mr. Freeze and a nun I

16:25.000 --> 16:30.840
Get a nun from the from the x-rated film The Devils that is

16:31.200 --> 16:36.680
For some reason in the back. There's a woman who looks like like June Cleaver. Yeah. Oh

16:37.680 --> 16:44.160
Trav just two other things that I needed to tell you real quick. I have a actually like it and the Hamburglar

16:44.880 --> 16:46.880
The ham what?

16:47.600 --> 16:53.280
That's great Trav, that's great. That's great. I'm gonna play a quick audio clip for you for this one

16:53.280 --> 16:55.280
Or else you won't believe me

17:09.440 --> 17:16.520
Yes, Rick and Morty in air in it they're in it they are explicitly not loony tunes

17:16.760 --> 17:20.400
They're not loony tunes. They're regular tunes. Can I tell you one of that?

17:20.400 --> 17:25.680
Can I tell you of all the things you've said to me today? Nothing is more

17:26.440 --> 17:28.000
offensive to me

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
than the inclusion of

17:30.040 --> 17:35.840
Huge Rick and Morty head. No, just the idea of like, okay, you're gonna include like real people in it

17:36.040 --> 17:41.520
Okay, great a crossover. That's great. But then also just like here's other cartoons

17:42.040 --> 17:47.840
This isn't fucking who frame Roger rabbit Travis Travis. You should not see this fuck

17:47.840 --> 17:55.760
Oh, hey Trav. Don't watch this. You're not ready go to some different places in this man. What are what are the rules?

17:56.480 --> 18:00.800
There's no rules Justin. What's your last thing? Cuz I got one last thing too that I think it's gonna be the

18:01.480 --> 18:06.880
See, I feel like mine is all right. Let's see. Let's hear it. This is it Travis. This is for all the marbles

18:06.880 --> 18:08.840
This is for all the marbles

18:08.840 --> 18:13.320
Griff let's say him at the same time. I want to say three two one and then we both say it. Okay, okay

18:13.320 --> 18:18.320
three two one Bugs Bunny dies at the end

18:27.640 --> 18:29.640
Hey Trav

18:29.640 --> 18:31.640
Hey Trav. Bugs Bunny dies in the sleep.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.640
Bugs dies at the end.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.640
Do you wanna do some Bugs Bunny dies?

18:35.640 --> 18:37.040
In order to win the game

18:37.040 --> 18:42.560
They got to do a special basketball move that will freeze the simulation and kill whoever does it and LeBron James is like

18:42.560 --> 18:43.520
I'm gonna do it for my son

18:43.520 --> 18:49.400
But then Bugs steals the ball and does it and dies and Travis for the extra bonus points

18:49.520 --> 18:53.360
Bugs Bunny's last words before he passes from the mortal coil are

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
What's down doc, I don't know

18:57.880 --> 18:59.880
That's pretty good. That's pretty good

19:01.160 --> 19:02.920
It's

19:02.920 --> 19:04.920
That's all folks. Oh

19:04.920 --> 19:12.480
Oh, that's touching. Oh god. What's down doc is actually extremely extremely choice. Well, he's afraid of going to hell

19:12.480 --> 19:16.000
So he's asking like what's down there? You know what I mean? I don't care to die, but

19:25.880 --> 19:27.880
So that is

19:27.880 --> 19:33.240
You can't just say Bugs dies. I'm not gonna watch this fucking play. We can't spoil everything Bugs dies

19:33.240 --> 19:35.240
Um, and then he's crazy

19:38.480 --> 19:45.600
Just later he's there and LeBron James is like you died and bugs buddies like no I didn't

19:47.520 --> 19:53.040
That's the dumbest thing you've ever said LeBron James you fucking idiot anyway, I'm gonna sleep at your home

19:54.160 --> 19:57.400
Okay in the film and honestly folks

19:57.400 --> 20:04.840
You probably should still watch it it's it's good. It's a it's great. It's supremely amazing. Hi. It's

20:04.840 --> 20:09.200
Amazing. I do actually want to watch it more. My kids were kind of like

20:10.000 --> 20:13.760
Idly watching at it and I'm like standing on my couch

20:14.320 --> 20:21.040
Tripping my shirt in half every five seconds because it's so utterly unhinged. It's not a movie

20:21.040 --> 20:23.040
No, no, no, no, no strictest sense

20:23.040 --> 20:27.900
In the strictest sense, but it's a heck of a thing. Hey, this is an advice show

20:29.400 --> 20:36.920
If you're about to tweet at any of us that we spent too long talking about space jam a new legacy or not long enough

20:36.920 --> 20:39.160
And if you're about to be there mad out spoilers or whatever

20:39.800 --> 20:43.120
Well that you can be mad about but if you're about to say we talked about too much

20:43.120 --> 20:48.920
I I encourage you to go listen to another podcast because this is this is who we are you you had to know

20:48.920 --> 20:54.720
What you were what you were jacking into at this point after 10 after 11 years?

20:54.880 --> 20:56.840
This is an advice show obviously

20:56.840 --> 20:58.840
So I wanted to give some advice to people

20:59.120 --> 21:05.000
The position of mayor in my very small town is mostly symbolic but would look great on a resume

21:05.000 --> 21:07.480
I have enough friends to get the votes next election

21:07.520 --> 21:13.520
But here's the tricky part the current mayor owns a record store. I go hang out at almost every weekend

21:13.520 --> 21:20.960
How do I unseat him without severing the relationship we have? That's from new mayor in New York

21:23.200 --> 21:30.200
Hmm, I mean you want to unseat Bill de Blasio you think you have enough friends to secure that

21:31.040 --> 21:33.040
Also another weird thing

21:33.560 --> 21:38.960
Bill de Blasio is a record store. Oh, yeah, it's crazy. Oh, yeah. He loves that stuff

21:39.760 --> 21:41.760
They may mean New York State

21:41.760 --> 21:49.440
Maybe that is actually that makes wicked more sense. Yeah a lot more so that might be possible. There doesn't have to be hard feelings

21:50.200 --> 21:55.280
Former Huntington mayor Jean Dean passed away this week. I'm sure you know sad news. Yeah

21:55.280 --> 22:01.160
Yeah, yeah, Jean Dean passed away this weekend Steve Williams current mayor Steve Williams, but a very nice tribute to her because she

22:02.920 --> 22:04.120
Absolutely

22:04.120 --> 22:09.400
Thumped his ass the first time they ran against him beat him shit senseless

22:09.400 --> 22:13.940
I hope he's listening to this because they really cheating beat the shit out of Steve

22:15.480 --> 22:20.480
And when she pat and he said that a few years later he saw her and

22:20.880 --> 22:26.880
He was and he had like focused on some other stuff after he got beat and it had gone well for him

22:26.880 --> 22:30.360
And he thanked her because if she hadn't beaten him so soundly

22:30.480 --> 22:35.840
He wouldn't have been focusing on the stuff like business-wise that he wanted to focus on so it all works

22:35.840 --> 22:41.960
I mean we all have different paths sure if your path is to be the mayor and his path is to be

22:42.800 --> 22:44.160
unseated by you

22:44.160 --> 22:48.560
It might work out for everybody in the end Steven Jean had a great relationship

22:48.960 --> 22:55.120
Until our passing you could bet you could have that relationship just because you have different paths that happen to intersect

22:55.680 --> 23:00.960
You know and maybe he doesn't want a mayor anymore. You know he doesn't want to be the mayor

23:00.960 --> 23:07.200
He has a record shop that sounds like kicks ass right yeah, and you're asking me Travis McElroy

23:07.200 --> 23:10.640
would I rather deal with the day-to-day stresses of

23:11.280 --> 23:13.280
running a city or

23:13.880 --> 23:17.220
Hang out at my super cool record store. Yeah

23:18.680 --> 23:19.960
I

23:19.960 --> 23:26.120
Think another sort of tact for this as you go to the mayor and say you got to be the mayor I

23:26.680 --> 23:29.560
Think it would be cool to be the mayor so it's my turn

23:29.560 --> 23:30.880
I

23:30.880 --> 23:32.880
Would like a turn at mayor, please

23:33.800 --> 23:34.880
um oh

23:34.880 --> 23:42.800
Yeah, walk out to him and symbolically like reach up right empty hands reach up to his head and say heavy is the head my friend

23:42.800 --> 23:46.440
I'll take it from here, please let me take the crown and then and so you're gonna

23:47.320 --> 23:53.340
Hey, this one's on me. You look so tired. You look so tired. You look like shit

23:53.340 --> 23:58.060
I'll take shit. This job is killing you. Hey, I'm gonna save your life

23:58.060 --> 24:03.780
You've aged 40 years in the last two my friend. Let me take over from here

24:03.900 --> 24:10.820
Can we talk about a town that's so small you could just decide to be the mayor, but can't support a record store

24:13.300 --> 24:18.540
It's a front for pot well, yeah, which it's a record store. That's right. Oh, yeah

24:18.540 --> 24:24.660
Fair enough. I just I think that when we all really think about we all look at our heart of hearts, right?

24:24.660 --> 24:28.700
I would say 99% of people who want to be the mayor

24:29.180 --> 24:31.420
Want to be the mayor so they can say they're in the man

24:31.420 --> 24:36.860
Not cuz all the hard work not cuz the change that want to implement no no no no it's the name

24:37.040 --> 24:42.300
So why not just say like hey, I'll be the mayor and you can be my vice mayor

24:42.780 --> 24:45.620
Yeah, and do the work and I'll be the mayor

24:45.620 --> 24:48.580
I want to I want to I want to challenge something

24:48.580 --> 24:54.760
I want to challenge the idea that being the mayor would look great on a resume because it does raise a central question

24:55.460 --> 24:59.260
All right, if you're the mayor and then you apply for a job

24:59.260 --> 25:05.620
Yeah, first first problem if you apply for a job while you are the mayor not great

25:06.140 --> 25:12.380
Great. Nope, not great second if you apply for a job after you're the mayor. Why aren't you the mayor? No more?

25:12.380 --> 25:15.740
Yeah, what hey, what happened? What happened there? No more

25:16.020 --> 25:24.060
Also, if you were a mayor and now you're applying to work at books a million or whatever like that seems to stay

25:24.060 --> 25:27.720
Why did you get out of politics? What happened? Was there a scandal? I'm going to assume

25:28.380 --> 25:36.100
Scandal definitely a scandal for sure a scandal. There are very few no matter where you look, especially in American politics

25:36.100 --> 25:41.740
I guarantee that there are very few politicians who reach any kind of like high-ranking level and then go

25:41.740 --> 25:45.940
Now I'm gonna go apply for jobs afterwards. Yeah

25:46.860 --> 25:49.660
Yeah, there's always something stinky in there in there

25:49.900 --> 25:56.180
There's always a little skeleton in the closet and the old mayor closet unless you're doing it unless you're only applying for jobs in

25:56.460 --> 25:57.700
the town

25:57.700 --> 25:59.700
That you were mayor of

25:59.820 --> 26:03.260
That feels like I could see that working out

26:05.260 --> 26:06.180
Um

26:06.180 --> 26:07.660
Man, it'd be cool to be the mayor

26:07.660 --> 26:11.980
You know, oh then if you apply somewhere else and they're like, hey, why are you the mayor anymore? You can just say like

26:11.980 --> 26:18.660
Oh my turn was done. My turn was on see that's what I'm saying. Let's break the stigma of losing at politics

26:19.180 --> 26:24.820
By just saying like everyone gets a turn like term limits is what you mean. I'm in favor

26:24.820 --> 26:27.660
Yeah, well Griffin, but like monthly. Oh

26:28.900 --> 26:32.460
Yeah, like get in there for a month and like get wild on it

26:32.460 --> 26:37.740
And I think this would break a lot of the gridlock, huh? If everybody's like we got a fucking month, right?

26:37.900 --> 26:39.140
Let's get it done

26:39.140 --> 26:44.720
Then there would reach a point though Griffin where and I don't know how long it would take before like, okay

26:44.720 --> 26:50.100
We need somebody to do this now anybody are we out of people who want to do it?

26:50.820 --> 26:54.020
Are we gonna start back at the beginning of the list? Oh, man

26:54.020 --> 27:00.980
Um, hey, do you all want to approach the wizard? Yeah, please. Let me humble myself. Yeah

27:02.180 --> 27:07.060
Big so I can scare him. Oh Travis. Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't you late? I'm doing it. Oh

27:07.620 --> 27:13.100
Damn it. I'm gonna roll. He turned out 20 sweet potato. I love sweet potatoes

27:13.600 --> 27:20.940
Well, this one was sent in by fucking Graham Roebuck. Thank you. Graham Roebuck. Just a platform agnostic treasure hunter

27:20.940 --> 27:26.420
It's like a Formula One racer comes and races at NASCAR like the hit film Talladega Nights

27:27.060 --> 27:29.060
exactly like that, so

27:29.260 --> 27:36.100
What we're looking at here is a this one's not peer-reviewed. Oh, I know that's important to some people

27:36.100 --> 27:40.300
It's gay, but it it is called how to live in a haunted house

27:41.100 --> 27:45.980
You just moved in and now you have really bad feelings about the place. Chances are the place could be haunted

27:45.980 --> 27:47.980
I mean it could be

27:47.980 --> 27:51.420
Any termites? Yeah, but it would be haunted

27:51.780 --> 27:53.340
Yeah, you may be frightened

27:53.340 --> 27:56.740
But don't be reading this article and can help you cope with the ghost presence

27:56.980 --> 28:00.420
Right in an awfully big check here at the top of the thing

28:00.780 --> 28:02.780
So very first thing guys

28:03.220 --> 28:07.540
Very first thing that is if you don't do this thing don't even think about living in a haunted house

28:07.580 --> 28:13.620
You got to take a well-built guard dog like German Shepherd with you into the house. What the fuck is that gonna do?

28:13.620 --> 28:19.820
The reason dogs easily detect the presence of spirits. It will be daring to you also with the dog

28:20.620 --> 28:23.820
Awesome. Yeah, but that's a dog. That's gonna work once

28:24.820 --> 28:30.900
Maybe the dog barks and the ghost goes whoa, and then goes oh wait. I'm a fucking ghost. I'm a ghost

28:30.900 --> 28:36.300
What are you gonna? Do this? Why does the size of why does it have to be a well-built guard dog like German Shepherd?

28:37.620 --> 28:41.600
When all it needs to do is since it's not gonna eat the ghost. It's not gonna get into a scuffle

28:41.600 --> 28:43.480
Do you know what I mean?

28:43.480 --> 28:45.240
anyway

28:45.240 --> 28:52.120
Remind yourself before you move anything into the house walk through the entire place doing this will give the ghost and then in parentheses

28:52.200 --> 28:57.640
s in case there's multiple ghosts a chance to scope you out and accept your presence in their home

28:57.760 --> 29:03.440
So just before you move anything in the house got to do a quick walk through so the ghosts get acclimated to your presence

29:03.440 --> 29:09.260
But do have an enormous fucking gnarly dog in there with you that the ghost will feel

29:09.260 --> 29:14.860
Afraid of and then they'll know what it's like to be to feel that fear

29:14.860 --> 29:20.740
Well, that's assuming that the dog is acclimated to goes to right ghosts aren't scared of any of this. Yeah

29:21.660 --> 29:25.620
Nothing could scare. Yeah. I don't know why the first move is

29:26.100 --> 29:31.260
Intimidate the ghost when it should be like listen. You're gonna need to get that ghost on your side toot sweet

29:31.820 --> 29:35.300
Yeah, well the ghost's forgiveness beg your pardon ghost

29:35.300 --> 29:41.500
Yeah, sorry to get like a good cable package or something for the ghost do stuff with the ghost that the ghost can't do for

29:41.500 --> 29:45.940
Themselves, I'll open the blinds so you can see outside or something, right?

29:45.940 --> 29:51.620
I will open these this box of cheese. It's for you. You have the cheese. It's within I know you have trouble with the box

29:51.620 --> 29:57.020
I'll put in some scented candle. Can you smell okay? Is that thing ghost can still do? I don't know

29:57.020 --> 30:01.740
We're still getting to know each other. Ask the dog the dog knows

30:01.740 --> 30:07.140
Remember before moving all your stuff into the place move as few items as possible. This will avoid riling the ghosts

30:07.660 --> 30:13.980
To the changes going on in the transition from former occupants. Why not just ask? Hey, can I put the couch here?

30:14.620 --> 30:16.620
Where that couch come from?

30:16.820 --> 30:22.540
If I could put the couch here, it's gonna get less glare on the television that I bought for us for us

30:23.100 --> 30:26.660
Go so this is a this is a boiling the frog sort of

30:26.660 --> 30:34.460
like strategy for moving into a ghost house is if you go slow enough the ghost won't even notice that you're a different person ghosts are

30:34.460 --> 30:39.420
Also, very inconsiderate. Yeah, keep in mind while moving furniture other objects and be alert for any feelings

30:39.420 --> 30:41.420
You may have about where an item should be placed

30:41.860 --> 30:46.860
If you can make a ghost happy, but it goes happy by placing a chair in a particular place

30:46.860 --> 30:50.540
It could save you lots of trouble later on. Yeah, put it in the middle of the kitchen

30:50.540 --> 30:52.540
This is a sofa middle of the kitchen

30:52.540 --> 30:54.540
It makes me happy

30:55.140 --> 30:57.060
That makes me happy

30:57.060 --> 30:59.060
Refrigerator backyard, but what?

31:00.420 --> 31:02.420
Okay, oh

31:03.580 --> 31:07.500
Man, is the dog is the ghost pissed off? Yep. Where does it want it?

31:08.820 --> 31:10.820
Put the oven in your bedroom

31:12.300 --> 31:16.660
What I agree what's what's it boo, why did you say boo you're the dog

31:16.660 --> 31:23.460
Are you guys on the same side now? Oh, no, I've been infected. You can't get affected. No, I got it. I got ghosts

31:24.620 --> 31:29.740
Man man try to relate to the ghost by talking about what life might have been like in the house if it is an old

31:29.740 --> 31:34.340
House and try to do something former residents would have done in the house while they lived there like eating some meals in a formal

31:34.340 --> 31:40.140
Dining room or listening to period music from the town that time the house was built. There's no way the ghost wants that

31:40.660 --> 31:42.460
When was this house built?

31:42.460 --> 31:48.060
Looks like 1993. This is how we do it. This is my jam

31:50.060 --> 31:52.060
This is how we do it

31:52.540 --> 31:56.980
Try to talk about some big events that would have happened while past owners would have been living there

31:56.980 --> 32:00.300
For example on October 29th of a year try to talk about how past

32:00.700 --> 32:03.780
Residents would have felt about the stock market crash in the beginning of the Great Depression

32:05.100 --> 32:07.100
You're bumming me

32:07.100 --> 32:11.460
Haha, please tell me what's going on with the Kardashians

32:12.580 --> 32:18.220
It's so close to Halloween. That's like my jam, but the Great Depression. Yeah, it's such though

32:19.580 --> 32:23.460
I don't want to think of it. Do you want to think about when your fish died? It's

32:28.060 --> 32:31.540
Avoid the area the ghost is in if if they are in a particular place

32:32.020 --> 32:34.580
Try using the room as a storage area and leave the ghost alone

32:34.580 --> 32:39.420
so do you want me to fucking have dinner with it and play fucking this is how we do it and talk about the

32:39.420 --> 32:41.420
Great Depression or do you want me to like?

32:41.700 --> 32:47.540
Chill on it and leave them to wither and rot. You could also just like not walk through it

32:47.540 --> 32:52.520
It's not like that's a lot of these are just good rules for having a roommate

32:52.700 --> 32:57.940
Don't sit on your roommate ask your roommate where to put the furniture talk to your roommate. What would they like?

32:58.820 --> 33:03.340
Try to spend a night in the place some ghosts try to communicate with the living through dreams allowing the ghost to get its

33:03.340 --> 33:06.420
Message to the living may put an end to the haunting and send the ghost on its way

33:07.140 --> 33:14.340
Well, I'm going to sleep in my house. Yeah, so this one's gonna get done. No matter what are you sure?

33:14.340 --> 33:20.740
I should try the other shit before this. Thank you for sleeping here. My message is there's a carbon monoxide

33:23.420 --> 33:25.300
Except the ghost

33:25.300 --> 33:29.540
This may be difficult for some to do most ghosts will leave you alone if you acknowledge their presence

33:29.540 --> 33:35.260
Hey ghost except the ghost leave them alone have dinner with them dream about them, but I love you

33:35.460 --> 33:42.300
Don't you do this to me man? I love you. Don't say it if you don't mean it you heard me

33:42.380 --> 33:44.380
Yeah, fucking love you

33:44.620 --> 33:48.080
Talk to the ghost let it know it's welcome to stay if it leaves you and your family alone

33:48.860 --> 33:54.620
But remember if the ghost does something scary let it know you are upset and that if that such behavior continues

33:54.620 --> 33:59.800
It will not be tolerated. Okay. Yeah. Okay fucking tough guy back that up

34:00.180 --> 34:02.380
Hey back that up shit head

34:02.380 --> 34:06.540
This is shifted from what to do if you have a roommate to what to do if you move into a house and there's a big

34:06.540 --> 34:07.940
scary dog there

34:07.940 --> 34:12.860
Yeah, hey you just stay over there and I'll stay over here. No, don't growl at my kid or else what?

34:13.460 --> 34:15.620
We'll move. I'll kick your ass

34:17.420 --> 34:19.420
Probably not that though

34:19.420 --> 34:26.260
Can be persistently aggressed some ghosts and be persistently aggressive in this behavior may prevent you from sleeping or enjoying your home life the

34:26.260 --> 34:28.540
Way you deserve to if this happens never respond in anger

34:28.540 --> 34:33.780
This will only add fuel to the fire focus on feeling love for these entities that probably haven't felt love in a very long time

34:33.780 --> 34:40.420
If ever directing positive energy toward them can be surprisingly effective in stopping unwanted behavior. Okay, so that's the tip

34:40.420 --> 34:45.060
I need to get some sleep. Do you want to make out? Yes, please. Yes, please

34:45.060 --> 34:47.060
I

34:47.940 --> 34:52.100
Don't know why my ghost kind of sounds like Bane a little bit it does a lot

34:52.980 --> 34:57.740
Let's take a quick break and then we'll be our back after this brief trip to the money zone

35:07.180 --> 35:09.180
Listen Justin you got calm down, buddy

35:09.180 --> 35:16.820
You're okay your your Andrew sleuthing the roof man unclench your jaw quick. Keep telling me about this why I definitely don't go pee

35:16.820 --> 35:21.900
Okay, but it's a shame cuz Justin could really benefit from the application. Yeah question

35:21.900 --> 35:27.020
Well, that's what it takes him sometimes like 40 50 minutes to pee cuz he's gotta relax all his muscles and take a deep breath

35:27.300 --> 35:29.020
He could be gone for a while now

35:29.020 --> 35:35.700
That's why calm is so great because calm is the number one mental wellness app to give you tools to improve the way you feel

oh

39:36.040 --> 39:39.560
Host of the town I was just toast of the town

39:40.840 --> 39:45.120
Turn that frown upside down. It's the crypt host of the town

39:45.760 --> 39:51.800
Why you ain't gonna need an actuary to know this news ain't deflationary. It's the

39:54.120 --> 39:55.920
Of the

39:55.920 --> 39:57.640
cryptost of

39:57.640 --> 40:04.360
The town I still don't understand what crypt toast of the town a lot going on here Griffin. Yeah

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
host of the town and crypto toast of the town and

40:08.340 --> 40:13.400
Justin please and so he's combining them like a portmanteau, but bad

40:14.120 --> 40:19.080
Okay, but I don't know if he's taking us into a crypt. I understand. There's no crypt. There's no

40:19.080 --> 40:25.600
Crypto Justin, please I'm explaining it cryptocurrency thing and he's gonna eat toast. I think okay

40:25.600 --> 40:31.840
No toast isn't part of it toast. Oh, yeah. No toast is definitely part of it. Definitely gonna be named. Yes. Yeah

40:32.520 --> 40:35.400
You said crypt toast of the town. Why would you say toe?

40:35.960 --> 40:37.520
toast of the town

40:37.520 --> 40:41.720
Where I tell you the latest in the world of cryptocurrency now

40:41.720 --> 40:47.960
I do a serious Bitcoin analysis show on tick-tock. This is not that this is for fun

40:47.960 --> 40:49.960
Okay. Yeah, and then we talk about toast

40:51.080 --> 40:55.160
Toast ain't part of it. I'm pretty sure it is because I don't know if you guys

40:56.160 --> 41:02.000
What's your guys? I need to know your real-world awareness of cryptocurrency Elon Musk made up some money

41:02.720 --> 41:04.720
Fucking nothing. Okay good

41:04.960 --> 41:08.560
Cuz here's this story is that do you guys know about alt coins?

41:09.040 --> 41:12.600
No, so all coins are kind of like spin-offs of the good

41:12.600 --> 41:18.560
Cryptocurrency, huh, which in and of itself is kind of questionable, right? It's great. It's cryptocurrency Knights

41:19.520 --> 41:21.400
Yeah, so

41:21.400 --> 41:23.180
the celebrities

41:23.180 --> 41:26.200
Because it's tough to make these rise above the den

41:27.320 --> 41:31.600
Celebrity and it's like really it's momentum based right like you remember what happened with those coin

41:31.600 --> 41:38.360
Oh where everybody's like doge, I love it. Let's get on board everybody buy a bunch and it's like wow, this is really expensive

41:38.360 --> 41:43.440
What's it for nothing? Okay, so they get celebrities to try to pump these up, right?

41:43.440 --> 41:46.360
So Logan Paul has been pushing one called ding

41:47.120 --> 41:48.800
Huh?

41:48.800 --> 41:51.360
No, no, you need to say that again, but

41:53.520 --> 41:55.520
It's called

41:57.920 --> 42:02.760
That's a coin that Logan Paul is pushing dink don't know it's not Justin

42:02.760 --> 42:08.240
It's a crypto meme. It's a meme coin. It's a mean coin called ding-dong

42:08.320 --> 42:11.440
It's a main point called ding-dong because nothing means nothing no more

42:11.440 --> 42:15.120
I didn't mean it's just a mean coin called ding-dong

42:15.480 --> 42:18.800
Cool, and that's pretty impressive as exciting

42:19.080 --> 42:26.340
But I that's not the celebrity coin that we're worked up about this week on cryptos of the town

42:27.240 --> 42:29.840
And I actually have the announcement here

42:29.840 --> 42:31.840
Oh, it's boop, it's boop-doop

42:31.840 --> 42:39.000
It's not boop-doop. It's uh, it's even better. I have the announcement here. Okay, I've actually brought them into the studio

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
What a thrill this is. You ready? Yeah

42:42.240 --> 42:49.320
The Stanley nickel token better known as the nickel token has officially launched on Uniswap and pocket swap

42:49.920 --> 42:53.640
Nickel is an ERC 20 token on the aetherium blockchain

42:53.640 --> 43:01.080
Including deflationary and frictionless yield mechanics. This means you earn more tokens

43:01.080 --> 43:04.800
Just by holding and the supply is constantly decreasing

43:05.640 --> 43:08.000
Raising the value of the remaining tokens

43:08.600 --> 43:14.360
Nickel is a utility token with a charitable basis rewarding holders with future NFTs

43:15.120 --> 43:17.400
memorabilia collectibles and addition

43:17.400 --> 43:25.320
So none of that is words. So here's the thing about it, you know Stanley from the office and how everybody loves Stanley

43:25.320 --> 43:32.240
Yeah, you you remember the great own footlander Stanley. You know the great episode with shrewp bucks

43:32.240 --> 43:34.240
Yeah, everybody loves those

43:34.320 --> 43:41.680
Stanley in that episode said I got a Stanley nickel and someone saw that and they thought I'm gonna do a real one

43:41.680 --> 43:45.560
I'll do a money on that. I'm gonna do a money all about that

43:45.560 --> 43:49.360
so the this is a the Stanley nickel is

43:50.360 --> 43:52.360
Leslie David Baker's

43:52.480 --> 43:59.480
Cryptocurrency that he I guess he you could tell from that that he did created himself and he hand coded it

43:59.720 --> 44:05.980
Obviously and that's Stanley from the office's money that he made up from the TV that comedy TV show The Office

44:06.080 --> 44:08.080
Yeah, but he can buy it

44:08.520 --> 44:12.540
Like and you can buy it and it's just out there, you know what I mean?

44:12.540 --> 44:18.420
Yeah, okay. Can I tell you my problem with cryptocurrency Justin you have a problem with cryptocurrency that doesn't seem possible

44:18.420 --> 44:23.980
It's all up side man. No, here's here's what it is. It's just it's very mechanical and practical which is they

44:24.860 --> 44:28.980
Invented currency, which is fine. That's how currency was invented in the first place, but then they also

44:29.940 --> 44:37.820
Invented all the words and all of the mechanics to talk about they couldn't at least have started from a place of vocabulary

44:37.820 --> 44:42.700
I can understand. It's friction. It's frictionless. It's frictionless. What does that mean?

44:42.700 --> 44:49.020
Does that mean I can slide it across a table forever because otherwise I don't know what the fuck it means. No, it's imaginary

44:49.020 --> 44:53.820
They won't actually. It's not real. Yeah, it is charitable. Some of the profits from this go to the

44:54.320 --> 44:55.780
Sorry, the actual fund which is cool

44:55.780 --> 45:01.260
He said in there and I want to really zoom in on one part of this that proves that it's not made up in fake

45:01.260 --> 45:04.500
Good, because I'm in the weeds right now. I need help

45:04.500 --> 45:07.820
He's the part where he says that it is

45:09.540 --> 45:12.180
It has yield mechanics sure

45:16.080 --> 45:23.200
You earn more tokens just by holding now and the supply is constantly decreasing so you earn

45:24.180 --> 45:32.220
You earn more. Oh, it's by holding it at least the one Justin and then the supply is decreasing. So I

45:32.220 --> 45:39.300
I don't that actually should make sense to you if you're in this. Yeah, you start so there's a hundred circulating, right?

45:39.300 --> 45:42.740
And then they kill one person who holds one. So now

45:43.260 --> 45:49.660
The 99 people remaining have a little bit extra and they just keep killing people one by one until eventually

45:50.020 --> 45:52.700
One person's token is worth a hundred

45:52.700 --> 45:59.660
It's worth all of them and they can go to a Subway sandwich restaurant and get a big sandwich for their fake office money

45:59.660 --> 46:03.100
It's six inches the best we could so I guess

46:03.660 --> 46:07.700
The reason I wanted to do this bit, which I don't think will be recurring is

46:08.620 --> 46:12.620
The guy who played Stanley on the office. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm

46:13.260 --> 46:15.940
Made a cryptocurrency and why haven't we?

46:16.820 --> 46:23.740
About a scene he did on the office one time called Stanley Nichols that you can buy and spend your money on and

46:23.740 --> 46:31.020
It's deflationary yield me obviously on the Ethereum blockchain. I hope of these I believe is on the Ethereum blockchain

46:31.020 --> 46:33.100
and guess what I'm what I'm saying is like

46:35.060 --> 46:39.720
Where do we go? Yeah from here because

46:40.420 --> 46:46.620
The idea that the guy what played Stanley would do a cryptocurrency about Sally Nichols is

46:46.620 --> 46:54.180
On my I feel like there is a lawsuit. It's hot that list of things kind of got ahead of us

46:54.180 --> 47:01.380
Maybe a few episodes in the future. We'll do this bit and they kind of stole it the idea from us

47:01.380 --> 47:04.780
I would write I have an idea Justin. I think you're right

47:05.420 --> 47:07.420
Everybody would be at dink-dink

47:08.540 --> 47:10.540
Stanley Nichols donkey-donk

47:10.540 --> 47:16.420
Um donkey lips whatever everybody's doing cryptocurrency. Why don't we do?

47:17.100 --> 47:18.580
Get this

47:18.580 --> 47:25.060
Classic currency. We're gonna start printing money and I've been doing I've been doing blacksmithing Justin

47:25.060 --> 47:30.980
You've been doing woodworking we can make our own coins and just declare that they are worth money

47:31.620 --> 47:37.360
Right. Okay. Ooh, can I twist that up a little bit? Yes, please. Can I twist that up a little bit?

47:37.360 --> 47:42.420
Yeah, we print that money, right? But it looks nearly

47:43.220 --> 47:45.220
indiscernible from US

47:45.520 --> 47:49.180
tinder, okay US currency dollars and cents and

47:49.740 --> 47:56.240
If we get caught and people are like, are you forging money? Nope, then we can say no

47:56.420 --> 47:59.720
This is dink doing this is a currency baby

47:59.720 --> 48:07.180
This looks like a fake $100 bill that you printed on a inkjet printer. That is black and white

48:07.180 --> 48:10.520
Yep, and you say that's how you know, it's dink doing baby

48:10.520 --> 48:16.680
I'm not going to this is dink doing too. I'm not going to jail for you or anybody. Yeah, I'm

48:17.240 --> 48:22.180
Guys, I'm trying to hang in here with you. Yeah, I really am trying to hang in here with you

48:22.320 --> 48:25.800
But just as I was about to move on to the next thing

48:25.800 --> 48:30.640
Oh, and I should also say dink doing too is it's gold stamp like it's backed by gold

48:30.640 --> 48:34.360
You can turn you in anywhere for gold. You gotta

48:35.760 --> 48:38.600
Just as I'm ready to like move on to the next bit

48:38.600 --> 48:44.960
I saw that screenshot I sent earlier and I sent you a picture from a real movie

48:45.520 --> 48:51.960
About the mask and Danny DeVito penguin and mr. Freeze and agent Smith watching Don Cheadle watch

48:51.960 --> 48:56.760
LeBron James and Bugs Bunny play basketball and I don't know it feels like a

48:57.280 --> 49:02.520
Photoshop that one of our fans made up about one of our great skits, right? Like what this is the same episode?

49:02.520 --> 49:05.660
What do we do? Like what things are outpacing us?

49:06.040 --> 49:10.920
Reality is outpacing. I tell you what's bothering me about this picture Justin if you look over

49:11.280 --> 49:18.140
Like if you follow back Don Cheadle to penguin to maybe Alexis Rose. I don't know

49:18.140 --> 49:22.720
I don't want to do jokes about a picture. No one can see yeah, we'll post it. Oh my god

49:22.720 --> 49:24.960
That is Alexis from Schitt's Creek

49:27.600 --> 49:31.480
Anyway, um, so I'm kind of having a little bit of a crisis about this

49:31.480 --> 49:36.720
I don't know what our I don't know what our contribution is to the culture at this point at this point

49:36.720 --> 49:38.720
I'm not classic currency

49:39.520 --> 49:41.520
So we can kind of

49:41.520 --> 49:48.160
Circle back around and get less weird. Oh, you know, yeah, we'll start back at the beginning baby trade economy

49:48.160 --> 49:51.640
I'll give you one goat you give me two bushels of grain

49:52.480 --> 49:58.300
Charlie it travels. She's coming Charlie. Did you just call that should give you a secret hint of the tone that's approaching

49:58.680 --> 50:04.520
Yeah, we we have never really been a sort of currency focused enterprise

50:04.520 --> 50:08.960
I don't know why we need to circle back around earth on the currency front

50:08.960 --> 50:12.760
I'm talking like in the currency of ideas the original currency

50:14.160 --> 50:16.760
We need to it needs we need to like

50:18.040 --> 50:22.040
Get less weird right like we need to somehow

50:23.080 --> 50:30.280
Like become the MacNeil layer news hour. Oh, you're saying everyone else is getting so weird that it's like maybe the new thing

50:30.920 --> 50:35.800
Maybe the thing that we could do is be like now we do fresh air

50:35.800 --> 50:37.800
Oh

50:37.940 --> 50:42.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's awesome. Well, we've already got movie reviews you can use

50:42.380 --> 50:46.020
Let's delete the first 12 minutes of this episode then where we talk

50:46.900 --> 50:52.040
Enthusiastically about space jam 2 and in fact, let's just try actually this is great. This is a great way to end the show

50:52.540 --> 50:56.660
Okay, let's try the intro again, but talk about space jam 2

50:57.140 --> 50:59.420
Like we don't like we're not excited about

51:00.860 --> 51:02.860
We can do that we can do that, okay, okay, okay

51:02.860 --> 51:05.060
Okay, bring us in Justin bring us in

51:07.460 --> 51:13.980
Hi welcome to can we check the name of the show is the same right? You can make it like brother talking brother

51:15.340 --> 51:17.340
brother brothers

51:18.860 --> 51:22.420
A good show. Yeah, Terry grosses next show is called brother zone

51:24.380 --> 51:30.920
Fresh brother fresh brother. Okay. No, I'll figure it out. It doesn't matter a touch of brother

51:30.920 --> 51:32.920
No

51:33.800 --> 51:35.800
Really so bad at this

51:37.440 --> 51:42.140
Meeting of them of them on of the great man. You're trying to get clever and it needs to be like

51:43.320 --> 51:45.320
More boring. Yeah, you're right

51:46.680 --> 51:48.680
Pod chat

51:49.040 --> 51:51.040
Podcasts. Hey, okay. Yeah

51:51.660 --> 51:58.480
Hello and welcome to the podcast chat show a show hosted by me Justin McQuarrie my two brothers

51:58.480 --> 52:06.340
Travis and Griffin on today's episode. What are we gonna be discussing griffin Griffin McElroy today?

52:07.200 --> 52:09.200
discussing the

52:10.480 --> 52:12.480
Disgracefully zany

52:13.040 --> 52:15.040
Major motion picture

52:15.280 --> 52:16.640
space jam

52:16.640 --> 52:22.840
To space jam a new legacy now Travis they've been trying to get this one made for quite some time

52:22.840 --> 52:24.680
Is that right some stops and starts?

52:24.680 --> 52:32.560
Yes, it's been in the works for about 25 years now and I I think it shows because it really reflects the mentality of the

52:32.840 --> 52:35.600
geopolitical culture that existed back in

52:37.000 --> 52:44.880
1996 when it was conceived and I don't think that it accurately reflects the current culture of the time. I

52:45.880 --> 52:52.400
Need to step in here and say please one point in the film an old

52:52.400 --> 52:54.400
Old

52:54.440 --> 53:01.080
Let's say nemesis to civility reared his head and I am talking about Austin Powers

53:01.560 --> 53:05.020
and when he arrived on the scene, I

53:05.640 --> 53:07.640
started to

53:07.680 --> 53:09.680
Throw up

53:09.800 --> 53:11.800
Because of how

53:12.680 --> 53:20.800
Absolutely wild and unexpected. This is a children's film about rabbit who can dunk a basketball and

53:20.800 --> 53:24.680
And Austin Powers is a rival on the scene

53:26.200 --> 53:30.920
Talking about his genitals and how much he loves to

53:31.760 --> 53:33.880
Fornicate now made me

53:34.880 --> 53:36.880
barf up the

53:37.520 --> 53:42.020
It made me barf up weird. It made me barf up the plain soup by eight now

53:42.160 --> 53:47.160
As as you know, I do not allow my children to watch movies let alone

53:47.160 --> 53:53.320
consume any form of media and I never will right how I become but the

53:53.760 --> 53:58.080
The idea that somewhere down the line they might be talking to a human being

53:58.440 --> 54:02.240
Who has seen this movie and they would recount this scene in which?

54:02.920 --> 54:07.500
Austin Powers discusses his genitals. It makes me vomit

54:08.000 --> 54:12.120
The right thousand oyster crackers I consumed this morning on a dare. I

54:12.120 --> 54:17.800
Also ate a thousand moisture crackers this morning, but they were unsalted. Of course

54:17.800 --> 54:21.780
I ate a picture of a thousand oyster crackers

54:23.720 --> 54:25.440
That was

54:25.440 --> 54:27.440
tasteless and odorless, but it was

54:27.960 --> 54:33.820
That's what my doctor told me to do for my various conditions. How big was the picture? Did you find it filling?

54:34.520 --> 54:36.800
It was a delicious picture. I

54:36.800 --> 54:43.920
I the I didn't appreciate when Austin Powers appeared in the screen my children

54:44.480 --> 54:46.480
Obviously have no friend or preference

54:47.160 --> 54:53.620
Any of his and they of course asked me who he was? Oh, just I wish sorry

54:54.160 --> 54:58.280
Of course, they would though if you're the makers of this film you have to expect it

54:58.280 --> 55:03.160
I then had to explain to my children about the British sex female

55:03.160 --> 55:05.160
And

55:05.840 --> 55:12.120
How he was basically a British a British man who has also

55:12.920 --> 55:14.920
Had the soul of Shrek

55:15.520 --> 55:22.000
In him confusing for my child as well. It is upsetting to me that they have the opportunity to include Shrek in

55:23.000 --> 55:26.280
This film who we all love. Oh, yes, of course

55:27.560 --> 55:29.880
Shrek is good. He's the modern Hamlet

55:30.360 --> 55:31.840
but

55:31.840 --> 55:34.980
No, that was a no. No that think you just said

55:35.960 --> 55:38.280
That was weird. If I think you misspoke and

55:40.840 --> 55:46.880
Say a normal thing, please of course the universal worldwide sex symbol Shrek whom we all

55:50.320 --> 55:54.120
Know okay. Let me try one more time. No more fun, please

55:54.120 --> 56:00.360
Please no more the Republican icon Shrek

56:04.360 --> 56:06.800

Well, that's a sticker. This mug is its own crypto currency and it's worth. Yeah, however many one mug
