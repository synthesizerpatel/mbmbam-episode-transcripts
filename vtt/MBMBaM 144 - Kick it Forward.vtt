00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:48.720
Hello, everyone. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother Man. Atop of the mornin' to ya.

00:50.000 --> 00:58.800
He said he had some in the chamber. I did not. Wowzers. Yikes. Let me try again. Okay.

00:58.800 --> 01:03.760
Hello, everyone. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother Man. Atop of the mornin' to ya.

01:03.760 --> 01:07.600
He doesn't know any other ones. That's the only one that he knows.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.160
I can't look at someone. Okay, try one more time. One more time. Okay.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.520
Hello, everybody. Atop of the mornin' to ya.

01:16.240 --> 01:21.680
I think we nailed it on that. Use take three. Yeah, got it in three. Whatever take you want to

01:21.680 --> 01:26.480
use it at. Three takes slightly racist McElroy over here. I also have something lined up about

01:26.480 --> 01:32.720
Aaron GoBrawlis. Okay. But we can talk more about that. I'll work it in. Okay. This is an advice

01:32.720 --> 01:41.040
show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Justin O'Mickelroy. There it is.

01:43.040 --> 01:50.000
And I'm your middlest brother, Thomas O'MacRoy. I'm Griffin O'MacRoy. That became Italian. I'm

01:50.000 --> 01:56.880
sorry, everybody. I know the first rule of comedy is to say yes and I'm saying no bye.

01:58.000 --> 02:08.000
No and then goodbye to this whole enterprise. No, but I'm leaving. This is the first St. Patrick's

02:08.000 --> 02:13.520
Day. It used to be a thing for me in Huntington and then less of a thing for me in Cincinnati.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.800
Every year that passed, it became less of a thing. This year, I'm just like,

02:18.800 --> 02:24.160
oh, I just don't want to deal with it. Well, you know what really killed me is like yesterday,

02:25.200 --> 02:29.440
everybody was out for St. Patrick's Day. And like by yesterday, we were recording Sunday,

02:29.440 --> 02:34.160
so that means Saturday. Like Saturday, all the bars were packed and it's like, hey, dog,

02:34.160 --> 02:38.240
it's not St. Patrick's Day. Yeah. What are these people doing? It's Saturday and they're out

02:38.240 --> 02:44.160
drinking. Well, no, I mean, it's not that. Where do these creeps get off? I'm just saying like two

02:44.160 --> 02:49.200
o'clock in the afternoon. Maybe that's not a good excuse. This is a my brother, my brother made

02:49.200 --> 02:54.800
creep alert. Some people are in bars on Saturdays on the day before St. Patrick's Day, which is a

02:54.800 --> 02:59.920
Sunday, because where do they get off? Well, they are wearing those Jamiroquai like, you know,

02:59.920 --> 03:04.960
green and white hats with like a shamrock on them. And I hate them. I want to kill them.

03:04.960 --> 03:09.680
You want to kill Jamiroquai? No, I want to kill anyone that impersonates Jamiroquai.

03:09.680 --> 03:15.200
There can be only one. How does anyone still harbor any sort of emotions whatsoever towards

03:15.200 --> 03:20.560
Jamiroquai? There is nothing you can say to Jamiroquai that he has not heard from the man

03:20.560 --> 03:27.200
who lives in his hat. There is one, there is one reference to Jamiroquai aloud and that is if you

03:27.200 --> 03:31.200
were in some kind of room with a moving floor and then you can say, oh, this is like that

03:31.200 --> 03:34.560
Jamiroquai video. And then the person will laugh. You can't say Jamiroquai hat, you have to say cat

03:34.560 --> 03:41.040
in the hat hat. Yeah, because I think of all the things that left a cultural mark on our culture,

03:41.040 --> 03:46.560
I think Jamiroquai maybe ranks in maybe a little bit lower than Dr. Seuss. You're saying Jamiroquai.

03:46.560 --> 03:53.840
I think it's Jamiroquai. Jamiroquai is the plural. From the Latin Jamiroquauses.

03:53.840 --> 04:05.200
It's Jamiroquus. To Jamiro. Yes. Oh, God. Do we want to do advice or just Jamiroquai this time?

04:05.200 --> 04:11.600
Yeah, just Jamiroquai material. Listen, March 19th, these all expire. So

04:15.120 --> 04:19.600
I've just been offered a job transplanting dead bodies to morgues and mortuaries.

04:19.600 --> 04:25.360
This means I will be cleaning up dead bodies from crime scenes, car wrecks, hospitals, etc.

04:26.400 --> 04:31.680
The problem is, how do I tell my family members without them freaking out? How do you tell your

04:31.680 --> 04:35.920
favorite podcast without them freaking out? Cause you didn't. Well, he doesn't know that cause he

04:35.920 --> 04:45.600
done did it wrong. Yeah. Okay, go ahead and finish it. Hold on. How do I ease them into the idea that

04:45.600 --> 04:52.320
this is an okay thing for me to do? That's from Bring Out Your Dead in Denver. Well, you should

04:52.320 --> 04:57.680
probably start off by telling them who you're employed by and not just saying, I have a job

04:57.680 --> 05:02.320
moving dead bodies. Yeah. Like how about this? Let me hit you with this. I work for the city.

05:03.120 --> 05:13.360
That is fine. And I specialize in disposal. I make dead bodies disappear. I'm a man with a

05:13.360 --> 05:19.760
man with a particular set of skills. I just bought a pig farm. You ever see that movie,

05:19.760 --> 05:25.040
Pulp Fiction? You remember that guy, the wolf? That's like me, except state sponsored.

05:26.000 --> 05:33.600
I'm the man you call when you have no other options. I'm a fixer, you might say. I'm a fixer.

05:33.600 --> 05:38.880
I'm a fixer for the city. Here's the thing. Your family has every right to be freaked out because

05:38.880 --> 05:44.080
when the zombie apocalypse happens, you are first to go. They're going to come back for him? No,

05:44.080 --> 05:50.320
I'm saying, have you never seen- You touched my dinkus while I was dead. I remember it.

05:51.680 --> 05:55.680
In movies, there's always that scene where the dude gets out of the ambulance or something,

05:56.560 --> 06:03.600
and then the sheet rises up and the zombie kills him. We watched the wrong movie. I watched

06:03.600 --> 06:11.600
Porky's 4 when the lead character from Porky's 3 dies. I think you mean Porky's 4 at Night of

06:11.600 --> 06:20.400
the Living Porky's. Porky, when Porky dies. You know what? I have to tell you, my friend,

06:21.280 --> 06:29.840
you have absolutely nothing to be embarrassed of. We are so lucky as a society that there are

06:29.840 --> 06:35.040
weirdos like you who are strong enough to do this job. Thank God there are freakos like you,

06:35.040 --> 06:41.040
freako. Thank God there are weird, weird- Weird dudes like you out there just doing it.

06:41.040 --> 06:48.560
Just get off on this kind of thing and love it. You love death bodies, you freako. You weird guy,

06:48.560 --> 06:53.280
you're a hero. Just let your freak flag fly, you freako. I think you can have this job. You

06:53.280 --> 06:58.640
got to take this job. It's fucking hard out there, you guys. You want this? Just say to your parents,

06:58.640 --> 07:03.840
hey, in this economy, I'm employed. When they're like, doing what? Just go, huh? What? Yeah,

07:03.840 --> 07:08.560
I'm totally employed. Literally anybody gives you a hard time about it, podcast included.

07:08.560 --> 07:14.240
The only response is, do you want to do it? Because someone is going to do this. True.

07:14.240 --> 07:17.520
And they're going to fucking rake in the cash while you're working at Arby's,

07:17.520 --> 07:21.840
and you'll still be moving dead bodies around, but it'll be cows, I guess.

07:21.840 --> 07:29.360
It'll be people that had a Jamocha shake on the floor just dead. There's somebody who works at

07:29.360 --> 07:34.480
Arby's whose only job is to move the dead people who died from the Arby's outside.

07:35.280 --> 07:41.360
It is a full-time year round job. I'm a fixer for Arby's is my job. The mozzarella sticks are people.

07:44.080 --> 07:48.960
I think, though, that anytime you meet somebody- It's good mood food, guys. It's good mood food

07:48.960 --> 07:53.120
because you get to meet your lord and savior, Jesus Christ. Who wouldn't that put into a good mood?

07:54.640 --> 08:00.000
If you meet anybody or you go on a first date, you got to run the screen pass on them until

08:00.720 --> 08:06.000
they know you well enough that when you tell them that you touch dead bodies for a living,

08:06.000 --> 08:10.480
they don't just assume there's some sort of Wednesday Adams scenario.

08:10.480 --> 08:14.800
Yeah, I think you could also start off just by saying, start off saying, work for the city,

08:14.800 --> 08:18.080
and then you work for a morgue, and then you work in transportation for the morgue,

08:18.080 --> 08:22.880
and then what you actually do, because if you start off with, oh, I roll up in my heavy van

08:22.880 --> 08:27.040
and load some dead bodies up in it, they're just going to picture a whistling dude slinging bodies

08:27.040 --> 08:32.720
over his shoulder. I think morgue step two is I think you're jumping several guns that you can

08:32.720 --> 08:37.920
really squeeze in there to prolong the magic. You could say, I work for the city, and then say,

08:37.920 --> 08:42.960
I work for a city in which people die. Okay, but even that, I would say, I work for the city,

08:42.960 --> 08:46.640
and they say, doing what? You would say, shipment, and they would say, of what?

08:46.640 --> 08:51.280
And you would say, materials, and they would say, what kind of materials? And you would say,

08:51.280 --> 08:54.960
organic materials. Formerly organic.

08:55.600 --> 08:59.680
They would say, animals, and you say, nope, keep guessing, and they say,

08:59.680 --> 09:02.560
this is the worst game and date I've ever been on.

09:03.520 --> 09:09.840
But then the desert's there, you just got free. Just hope she loves mystery.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.400
If you want to find out the answer, see you for round two.

09:12.400 --> 09:16.320
Mm-hmm. Or maybe you get in a car wreck on the way home,

09:16.320 --> 09:20.560
and then I will see you also there also. I think there's a great opportunity here.

09:21.600 --> 09:26.640
If you are actually okay with this job, and God bless you for being so,

09:27.520 --> 09:32.800
I think it would be really fun to just pretend all the time that you're horrified,

09:32.800 --> 09:36.800
because it's completely human. Can you imagine the dude like,

09:36.800 --> 09:42.720
go ahead and call the body truck, and you say, oh my God.

09:42.720 --> 09:46.320
Oh God. It's never been like this before. This is my first day.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.760
This is somebody's ping-pong.

09:49.200 --> 09:53.200
You would think they would train me or something. It looks like my Nana.

09:53.200 --> 09:58.800
Why did I have to drive my own car? I had to drive a Toyota Corolla.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.600
I didn't have any room for this car. I have a two-door.

10:01.600 --> 10:08.400
Someone cut off his legs. Does anyone have a leg axe?

10:08.400 --> 10:14.160
I need to put him in the trunk of a boot. If you're in Canada, I guess.

10:15.840 --> 10:20.400
I think there are so many options. There's so many directions you could take that character.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.840
Oh man. You could be like weird philosophical guy.

10:23.840 --> 10:30.080
Like, oh, so young, so short. He's 90. He's 90. He died fucking.

10:30.080 --> 10:33.840
He's 90 years old. I know. So beautiful. What a beautiful body.

10:34.640 --> 10:38.880
I've seen a lot of cadavers, but your peepum's cadaver is fucking beautiful.

10:40.480 --> 10:42.240
It's a beautiful form, beautiful life.

10:42.960 --> 10:46.480
You could be the guy that shows up and suddenly hints at the fact

10:46.480 --> 10:50.640
that maybe someone should stake him. You should definitely stake the body.

10:51.280 --> 10:56.080
Gosh. Anybody got any chopsticks or anything?

10:56.080 --> 11:01.120
A little final cleanup, if you know what I mean. You smell garlic?

11:03.120 --> 11:06.080
You could also just pick one up and go and just announce loudly,

11:06.080 --> 11:11.440
I'm recreating Weekend at Bernie's 2 tonight. Get it? It's a Bernie. I'm going Bernies.

11:11.440 --> 11:15.040
I'm doing Bernies, guys. Or you could help out the detectives without

11:15.040 --> 11:19.920
them asking. Oh, this looks like poison to me. Poison again.

11:19.920 --> 11:27.280
He is on the side of the road and his car is cut in half on a tree, literally 200 feet away.

11:27.280 --> 11:31.040
Natural causes. Naturally, he was poisoned.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.640
Well, man, I'm so glad that people do this. Right?

11:35.680 --> 11:38.720
There aren't just dead bodies everywhere? This is everywhere.

11:39.280 --> 11:41.840
I think that's how probably America rolled for like 50 years,

11:41.840 --> 11:43.600
and then eventually they're like, you know what, guys?

11:44.160 --> 11:46.240
I've been thinking. We should clean this up.

11:46.240 --> 11:49.040
You know how we've been talking about job creation and this tough economy?

11:49.040 --> 11:52.720
I got a great idea. Let's move these fucking bodies everywhere.

11:52.720 --> 11:56.160
You know what would be like the boldest move, like the body movers would on strike.

11:56.160 --> 11:59.120
I guarantee you can have whatever you want. Oh, my God.

11:59.120 --> 12:04.800
If you were just like, hey, Mayor, if you don't pay us an extra $5,000 a week, we're out.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.360
Yes, yes, yes, whatever. Please don't make us touch dead people.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.800
Please, we can't do this again with you. We can't touch dead people.

12:10.800 --> 12:17.680
Imagine going to that union meeting. I would not be able to.

12:17.680 --> 12:23.280
The meeting of the party movers. My name is Morpheus.

12:23.280 --> 12:27.840
My name is also Morpheus. Wait, are we all Morpheus?

12:27.840 --> 12:31.600
Damn it, guys. I said we could have 10 Morpheus' tops.

12:32.240 --> 12:36.960
Listen, I know it's inconvenient with the pipe organ being out of service.

12:36.960 --> 12:43.920
I brought an MP3 player and some speakers. Morpheus, please set it up for me.

12:43.920 --> 12:49.680
Morpheus 6? No, Morpheus 6. Morpheus 6, he's good with technology.

12:53.200 --> 13:01.840
He was the first one of us to have email. You can read me at deadguycarrier at hotmail.com.

13:01.840 --> 13:09.440
My address is deadguycarrier13 because there's 12 of you guys in the union.

13:09.440 --> 13:16.400
My last request is please refer to everybody as this fat piece of shit.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.400
Hold on, let me get this fat piece of shit in the truck.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.280
This is a six-year-old girl.

13:25.280 --> 13:28.080
This is a six-year-old girl. That's awful.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.480
Interesting litmus test between Griffin and I.

13:30.480 --> 13:35.520
For me, she was an eight-year-old girl. Griffin's a little darker today with a six-year-old girl.

13:35.520 --> 13:38.000
Well, that's just me. You guys want a Yahoo?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.440
Yes. This Yahoo was sent in by who else? Ira Ray.

13:42.240 --> 13:45.680
Are you Ira Ray? Who wants to know?

13:45.680 --> 13:51.200
I never know when you're setting it up for the assist or if you're just putting in dramatic pause.

13:51.200 --> 13:55.920
The number one thing people tweet about our show these days is not understanding the reference.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.160
Jimmy Ray, guys. Just Google Jimmy Ray. That's it. Google it.

14:02.160 --> 14:07.440
It's asked by Yahoo! Interest user whiteandnerdy who asks,

14:07.440 --> 14:11.840
How can I overcome my strange sexual attraction to my high school mascot?

14:14.240 --> 14:18.240
My high school mascot is a mustang, as in a horse,

14:18.800 --> 14:23.440
and I can't stop feeling sexually attracted to the person in the costume at all the games.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.160
It's beyond embarrassing since I'm one of the cheerleaders.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.320
What are some ways to get over this strange attraction?

14:30.320 --> 14:32.800
I'd love to hear from others who have had this same problem,

14:32.800 --> 14:35.520
and what they've done to get over it. Thanks, everyone.

14:35.520 --> 14:42.000
Okay, so let me tell you what I did. You gotta just get it out of your system.

14:42.000 --> 14:48.720
Yes, get on that. Get to the enough previews, time for the main attraction.

14:48.720 --> 14:54.000
Just lock yourself and this poor, poor person inside of this mascot costume

14:54.000 --> 14:57.360
in a hotel room for a weekend and just work it out.

14:57.360 --> 15:03.040
And run out of fluid. There are so many-

15:03.040 --> 15:04.720
Just love till you're dehydrated.

15:04.720 --> 15:08.160
I need so much more detail, because it could be,

15:08.160 --> 15:11.680
maybe this person has a horse thing, maybe this person has a furry thing,

15:11.680 --> 15:15.360
maybe this person just thinks the person inside the costume is sexy,

15:15.360 --> 15:20.640
maybe they just have an objective sexual attraction towards disguises.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.880
The one that really threw me off is the statement of,

15:22.880 --> 15:25.920
I am attracted to the person when they are in the costume.

15:25.920 --> 15:30.000
Right, maybe they just have an overabundance of school spirit

15:30.000 --> 15:34.560
that manifests as a chub. Yes.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.440
Okay, they got a spirit chub.

15:37.440 --> 15:40.320
Hey, go Mustangs, we're just so proud of- Oh, fuck.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.920
We've got bonus, yes we do. We've got bonus, how about you?

15:46.400 --> 15:49.680
Wait, is the person asking this question a guy or a girl? Does it matter?

15:49.680 --> 15:55.040
I think it's a girl based on the avatar, which is a cartoon girl.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.360
So, I take it back. And she's blue.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.160
She works with a tree.

16:00.160 --> 16:04.240
It's hard to think about these things.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.720
It's hard for- Do you mean for you?

16:08.720 --> 16:11.600
For me. It's difficult for me as a person.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.960
It's hard knowing these things we know about people.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.840
Let's go down the list. Okay, here are- I can really-

16:18.640 --> 16:22.320
When I don't have anything to say, like any advice,

16:22.320 --> 16:25.680
I just try to go back to my own experience. So, let's see.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.000
In elementary school, there were the Miller Owls,

16:28.000 --> 16:31.200
which I guess is kind of a sexy animal. So sexy.

16:31.200 --> 16:36.400
With their big, wet eyes. They have big, moist eyes.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.520
And a wingspan that can really wrap around you.

16:41.840 --> 16:46.240
Hey, if you guys saw an owl that had one of its eyes gouged out,

16:46.240 --> 16:50.640
would you fuck the socket? Now wait, hold on.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.480
You get $8. Oh, yeah.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.120
Wait, wait, wait. As a reward?

16:59.120 --> 17:02.080
Or just that's what happens when you fuck an owl's eye?

17:02.080 --> 17:05.200
He can- Also, two other things. Two other facts.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.960
He can talk and he wants it.

17:08.640 --> 17:11.120
Okay, well if those are- Then yes, all day, every day.

17:11.120 --> 17:13.360
Is anyone watching? Where is this taking place?

17:15.440 --> 17:17.200
In the privacy of my own home?

17:17.200 --> 17:18.640
Has the owl come to find me?

17:18.640 --> 17:22.320
It's taking place in that citadel from the Hunger Games.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.080
Does everyone else want it too?

17:26.720 --> 17:31.680
Yeah, they all want $8 so they can buy a healing paste.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.680
You need a healing balm. Okay, wait.

17:35.120 --> 17:40.080
You have a laceration on your penis and inside every owl's eye socket,

17:40.080 --> 17:45.520
as we know, is a healing balm. You're in the Hunger Games.

17:45.520 --> 17:48.720
Your penis has been lacerated by someone from District 11

17:48.720 --> 17:51.520
with the fish guts and what have you.

17:51.520 --> 17:56.640
And the owl is like, listen, I only have one eye.

17:56.640 --> 18:03.120
The other sockets all balm. Also, let me sweeten the pot $8.

18:04.160 --> 18:07.040
Also, I'm totally down. I am down with this.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.920
Also, I should have you know, it will be consensual

18:09.920 --> 18:13.040
because man, oh man, I am hard up over here.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.360
Right? I love those District 12 boys.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.480
I don't know what it is.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.600
Maybe it's the way you smell like coal or are malnourished.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.840
I'm a big fan of this right now.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.360
And I, man, sometimes Sydney listens to the show

18:25.920 --> 18:30.160
and sometimes I'm like in the place where I can see her facial expressions.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.120
And I'm just gonna be good.

18:31.120 --> 18:37.120
I may have to go on vacation or something, a private vacation just as a J-Man.

18:37.120 --> 18:42.640
I don't think I ever had a mascot that I found even remotely sexy.

18:42.640 --> 18:46.080
I had an owl. I had a blue streak, whatever the fuck that is.

18:46.800 --> 18:52.800
I had a Highlander and I had a herd of bison,

18:52.800 --> 18:57.760
which I guess if there was one of them, yeah, I guess maybe one sexier than the other.

18:57.760 --> 18:58.160
Yeah.

18:58.160 --> 19:00.080
You know, you got to pick off the sexiest.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.160
That's how it works.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.760
I think what's really got to be the worst moment

19:05.760 --> 19:07.680
is when you are like in middle school and stuff

19:07.680 --> 19:09.520
and you're walking around with your friends

19:09.520 --> 19:13.760
and one of them says like, man, this may sound weird,

19:13.760 --> 19:16.480
but like Mrs. Smith is like the hottest teacher.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.880
And they're like, you know what, I agree.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.440
And then it's like, yeah, did you check out Jimmy's mom?

19:21.440 --> 19:22.880
Yeah, yeah, she's really hot.

19:22.880 --> 19:26.640
And then the other one's like, and I really kind of want to fuck the mascot.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.040
Yeah, did you see Chompers out on that last game?

19:29.040 --> 19:30.320
Chompers the biting horse.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.000
Oh, man.

19:32.640 --> 19:36.240
And that's the moment where you get to realize that you're weird.

19:36.240 --> 19:39.760
Or like you can pinpoint him and I don't mean that as,

19:39.760 --> 19:42.240
I don't mean that judgmentally from my point of view.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.080
I mean, like up until that moment,

19:45.280 --> 19:46.240
who are we?

19:46.240 --> 19:48.160
Who are we to say what's right and wrong?

19:48.160 --> 19:48.800
You know, right.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.200
But that's so easy for us to point to point fingers.

19:53.760 --> 19:54.880
But that's what you're doing.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.440
I think doing exactly that.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.560
I'm saying the people that judge this person were wrong.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.880
So you're saying this was a learning.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.840
This is a lesson for the people who were like, I want to fuck my teacher.

20:05.840 --> 20:09.680
And there were the other guys like, I want to fuck the mascot because it's a beautiful horse.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.560
And they were like, oh, you just made me think about things.

20:12.560 --> 20:13.060
Uh-huh.

20:13.920 --> 20:14.640
You know what?

20:14.640 --> 20:17.840
Maybe, maybe I can see things from your point of view.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.160
Chompers is a beautiful, beautiful mascot.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.440
Mm-hmm, sinewy.

20:21.440 --> 20:22.400
Uh-huh.

20:22.400 --> 20:23.840
So, so sinewy.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.600
And look at the emotion.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.560
It's like a poem.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.000
But that's, let's not, let's not discount the fact.

20:30.000 --> 20:30.480
Erase the hate.

20:30.480 --> 20:34.400
Erase the hate, let's not fucking discount the fact that this horse mascot

20:34.400 --> 20:38.720
might be doing some of the sexiest moves we've ever fucking seen before.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.360
He may be out there like, like, okay.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.280
Have you ever seen those YouTube videos of that guy that dresses up in like

20:45.280 --> 20:49.280
this skin tight horse outfits and then goes to like public park and just like.

20:49.840 --> 20:50.720
They're all I watch.

20:50.720 --> 20:51.760
Just gets it.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.120
You know what I'm talking about, though, right?

20:53.120 --> 20:53.680
No bullshit.

20:53.680 --> 20:54.400
Fuck yeah, I dare you.

20:54.400 --> 20:55.440
This fucking guy.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.520
Imagine that moves like Usher.

20:59.520 --> 21:03.040
Like, how are you not supposed to get lubed up over that?

21:03.600 --> 21:07.280
That's, that fucking would get anyone's noodle going.

21:07.280 --> 21:08.000
Mm-hmm.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.800
Like, yeah, I'm completely with you on this front, Griffin.

21:11.680 --> 21:15.440
I do not think that there is a principal alive who would allow that, though.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.760
Oh, what do you want?

21:17.760 --> 21:22.080
A skin tight rubber horse outfit and you want to fake jerk off.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.160
I don't know, but okay.

21:24.160 --> 21:25.600
If it'll help win games.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.040
If it'll put butts in the seats.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.800
Puts in the seats.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.000
Man, 21 Jump Street 2 is really messed up.

21:32.000 --> 21:32.240
Yeah.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.560
Hey, here's another question.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.680
I recently broke up with my long term, long distance girlfriend.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.800
Doesn't seem to be any lingering feelings between us, which is good.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.400
However, for the extent of our relationship, she was better employed than I was

21:44.400 --> 21:46.400
and bankrolled many of our visits.

21:46.400 --> 21:50.560
I recently became gainfully employed and now I feel I should repay her for months of being a

21:50.560 --> 21:51.840
broke bum somehow.

21:51.840 --> 21:55.760
Is there a tactful, mature way to do this without sending the wrong signals?

21:55.760 --> 21:58.400
That's from Newly Employed in New York.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.080
I mean, honest answer.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.800
Yeah, just like do it.

22:02.800 --> 22:10.640
Well, I mean, say like, hey, Susan, I've got this new job and I'm feeling like maybe I should

22:10.640 --> 22:15.840
pay you back for all the times that you covered my my ticket to come visit you.

22:15.840 --> 22:16.880
And here's the thing.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.040
Well, she's going to say no.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.280
Ignore the things that this is a secret.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.920
This is a secret B side track.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.640
Don't do what Travis is saying.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.640
This is what Travis.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.600
No, why is that not the right thing to do?

22:31.600 --> 22:35.760
Because Travis, you don't do reparations for X.

22:37.760 --> 22:38.800
You don't do it.

22:38.800 --> 22:39.920
It doesn't work.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.840
She would rather just not shoot.

22:41.840 --> 22:47.360
I would pay however much money this person is thinking about giving me to not have to

22:47.360 --> 22:49.120
enter into this scenario.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.320
This conversation.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.400
You could be spared this conversation.

22:52.400 --> 23:01.280
If you I mean, they didn't the they didn't pay for you guys to visit each other with

23:01.280 --> 23:04.480
any expectation of a return on that investment.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.400
OK, so, OK, there's the twist.

23:06.400 --> 23:12.160
If in the original discussion, OK, she said something like and she was like, I want you

23:12.160 --> 23:12.800
to come visit me.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.520
And you said, I can't really afford that right now.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.360
Maybe we can set something up soon.

23:17.360 --> 23:21.040
And she said, don't worry, I'll cover it and you can pay me back.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.560
Then I think that door is open.

23:22.560 --> 23:29.680
OK, if it was a loan, if it was clearly, clearly put forth as a loan, I think that that's one

23:29.680 --> 23:30.160
thing.

23:30.160 --> 23:34.080
But like nobody wants to I mean, this is just the cost of doing business.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.080
Like there's a cost of being in a relationship.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.680
No one gets their money back.

23:37.680 --> 23:43.120
Now, I would I would love that if it was when you break up, you're like, OK, so I did keep

23:43.120 --> 23:48.000
track of how often I pay for dinner and you pay for dinner and it does work out.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.440
So you owe me like 15 bucks.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.960
There's a slight imbalance out of the I do need $15 from you.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.560
I just need to get it to zero.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.160
You know, it's a fiscal thing.

23:56.160 --> 23:56.960
It's my account.

23:56.960 --> 24:00.240
My board is on my board once you forget about you, forget about that shit.

24:00.240 --> 24:04.800
And the first time you go to secure a home loan, they're like, oh, it looks like you

24:04.800 --> 24:09.120
still owe your ex-girlfriend from high school $15.

24:09.120 --> 24:15.040
So your credit is just in the pooper because with with the Jews, that's now up to fifteen

24:15.040 --> 24:16.080
thousand dollars.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.960
Sorry, Griffin, what was that?

24:18.960 --> 24:19.760
The Jews.

24:20.640 --> 24:25.200
OK, so I think step one is fire your anti-Semitic accountant.

24:25.760 --> 24:29.680
No, not the Jews, the Jews.

24:29.680 --> 24:30.640
OK, I'm with you.

24:32.320 --> 24:36.800
Because of the Jews, you owe your girlfriend fifteen thousand dollars.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.760
There is no God's chosen people must be tattooed.

24:39.760 --> 24:47.920
There is no lower form of comedy than, hey, that sounds like Jews that there isn't.

24:47.920 --> 24:48.400
There is.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.440
It's that false.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.400
Here's my B side to the point you're making.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.840
OK, isn't it?

24:57.600 --> 25:02.560
OK, hey, I like I really you know, I think I'm ready to forgive Tom Cruise.

25:02.560 --> 25:03.920
Did you say Tom Jews?

25:05.760 --> 25:07.360
That's my impression of you all day.

25:07.360 --> 25:10.240
OK, that was a good impression.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.600
I think you got me on that one.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.080
Thank you for not making me sound as nasal as I am.

25:16.080 --> 25:17.680
I appreciate you adding some baritone.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.480
This is not a conversation.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.360
Here's a good metric for if you should do something.

25:27.920 --> 25:36.400
Talk to everyone you know and see if anyone has ever heard of the thing you're talking about.

25:36.400 --> 25:41.520
Because if not, it is safe to assume that society as a whole

25:41.520 --> 25:47.360
has tried it out and there were some unforeseen consequences.

25:47.360 --> 25:50.480
You just have to trust that people have thought of this before

25:50.480 --> 25:55.440
and it didn't work out if you can't find anyone who has been in a similar scenario.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.240
The other thing is, I'm of the opinion that once you break up with somebody,

26:00.240 --> 26:06.080
the only sane thing to do is to put them in a mine rocket and shoot them in the sun.

26:06.640 --> 26:14.480
Like, as far as you're concerned, no, I'm as far as you're concerned, who visited where, paid for what?

26:15.120 --> 26:16.160
What is money?

26:17.040 --> 26:18.000
What is money?

26:18.000 --> 26:19.040
Who am I?

26:19.040 --> 26:20.560
How did I get here?

26:20.560 --> 26:22.320
Why is there blood everywhere?

26:22.320 --> 26:24.880
John G. raped and murdered my wife?

26:24.880 --> 26:26.080
What are you saying?

26:26.080 --> 26:30.080
Call the fixer.

26:30.960 --> 26:31.920
Call the fixer.

26:31.920 --> 26:32.880
I got a body here.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.920
I don't, no, like, don't do that.

26:35.920 --> 26:39.520
There was no, if she was asking you about it, I think that would be one thing.

26:39.520 --> 26:45.280
But like, I think that that could, you run a genuine risk of that coming off as very hurtful.

26:45.280 --> 26:52.480
I mean, when you were together, it was worth that money to spend time with you.

26:52.480 --> 26:57.360
And like, I don't think the relationship ending should or would negate that.

26:57.360 --> 27:01.280
I mean, if you guys had invested in a thing together, that's one thing.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.480
But this is just time.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.520
To go a bit deeper with our diagnosis, is it possible?

27:06.160 --> 27:11.920
And there's nothing wrong with this impulse, but is it possible that because you were,

27:12.560 --> 27:17.600
as you said, a broke bum while you were dating, and now that you are not dating,

27:17.600 --> 27:23.760
you kind of want to show her, without malice or intent, that you've kind of gotten your shit

27:23.760 --> 27:29.520
together because now you have the money that you did not have while you were dating.

27:29.520 --> 27:30.720
Does that make sense?

27:30.720 --> 27:38.160
Yeah, it sounds like this might be a bit more about assuaging your guilt than actually trying

27:38.160 --> 27:39.040
to set it right.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.320
I'm not even talking about guilt.

27:40.320 --> 27:48.960
I'm talking about either, like you may have some deep, dark desire to get back with her,

27:48.960 --> 27:50.240
or not even that, just to show-

27:50.240 --> 27:52.800
It may also just be a message of like, hey, I'm doing okay.

27:52.800 --> 27:57.920
Yeah, like I am doing better than I was doing when we were dating, which I really,

27:58.960 --> 28:02.400
as long as you're not a dick about it, I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with

28:02.400 --> 28:08.080
that, but I think that might be what you are also doing by saying, here, let me give you some money.

28:08.080 --> 28:11.280
Here, have this money, you know what I mean?

28:11.280 --> 28:13.200
Hey, that's another great test.

28:13.200 --> 28:17.600
Say the phrase, hey, let me give you some money and see if it doesn't make you feel like you're

28:17.600 --> 28:18.720
paying a prostitute.

28:18.720 --> 28:22.960
Yeah, say, listen, I left money for gas on the dresser, how does that make you feel?

28:22.960 --> 28:28.720
I feel like, I mean, maybe it's oversimplifying, but I feel like if you say, here's some money

28:28.720 --> 28:31.360
for the time that we loved each other, like-

28:31.360 --> 28:35.360
Here's some money for the time that we loved each other.

28:35.360 --> 28:36.880
I mean, is that not it?

28:36.880 --> 28:39.600
Thank you for the love acts, here is the money.

28:39.600 --> 28:44.000
Travis, can you please go back in time until Travis from four minutes ago, this axiom,

28:44.560 --> 28:46.240
this wisdom, you somehow gleaned?

28:46.240 --> 28:50.080
Yeah, listen, sometimes the people that learn the most is me.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.440
Speaking of money for love acts, do you guys want to go to the money zone?

28:57.440 --> 29:13.040
Travis, do you know Dana Ray polling?

29:13.040 --> 29:13.600
Yes, I do.

29:14.560 --> 29:15.120
Shit, really?

29:15.680 --> 29:17.760
Yeah, he lives next door to me.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.120
What do you know about him?

29:19.120 --> 29:22.240
Well, I know that he has two best chippies, Jordan and Joe.

29:22.960 --> 29:23.200
Okay.

29:23.200 --> 29:29.040
And it also is important to note that all three of them are dudes, even though two of

29:29.040 --> 29:30.720
them have lady names.

29:30.720 --> 29:31.520
Jordan's not-

29:31.520 --> 29:35.040
Jordan, I mean, Jordan's like an ambiguous lady name.

29:35.040 --> 29:35.520
Yeah.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.320
What about Joe?

29:36.320 --> 29:37.440
Joey Potter?

29:37.440 --> 29:37.920
Anyone?

29:38.560 --> 29:40.960
Anyone know about, ever heard of Joey Potter?

29:40.960 --> 29:41.520
Anyone?

29:41.520 --> 29:43.200
Did you finish it by the way, Griffin?

29:43.200 --> 29:46.640
Not yet, I fucking stalled out on that last season, it gets bad.

29:46.640 --> 29:47.600
You were so close!

29:47.600 --> 29:48.320
Uh, yeah.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.840
Can we go back, hey, guys?

29:49.840 --> 29:51.600
Hey, Travis, tell us about Dana.

29:51.600 --> 29:58.960
Well, basically, Dana grew up on a bird farm, where they would plant birds in the ground,

29:58.960 --> 30:02.800
I think, and he is supremely aware of making love to a goose.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.880
That's not what the sentence says!

30:06.880 --> 30:08.240
But we read between the lines.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.960
I love it, you chopped and screwed their intent.

30:11.600 --> 30:17.360
It says, Dana is supremely aware of what you mean by love goose, which I can only take

30:17.360 --> 30:19.200
to mean he's taken a bird lover.

30:19.200 --> 30:25.440
I should also mention before we go too much further, happy birthday, Dana!

30:25.440 --> 30:26.320
Oh yeah, that's cute.

30:28.080 --> 30:30.080
What a great dude you are.

30:30.080 --> 30:33.760
He loves video games and bargain hunting, for collectibles preferably.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.240
Chairs, life hacking, and goose fucking.

30:36.240 --> 30:39.360
Happy birthday, Dana, and we're sorry.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.400
We're so, so sorry.

30:42.400 --> 30:46.080
Folks, support for My Brother, My Brother, and Me comes from Audible.com, a provider

30:46.080 --> 30:47.920

30:49.440 --> 30:53.920

30:53.920 --> 30:56.080

30:56.080 --> 31:01.680
My Brother, My Brother, and Me listeners might enjoy Packing for Mars by friend of the Family,

31:01.680 --> 31:02.800
Mary Roach.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.240
Ooh, I like that.

31:04.240 --> 31:06.800
She is, we're tight, we're bros.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.040
I know, but I thought you were going to say friend of the show.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.080
I like friend of the family better.

31:10.080 --> 31:11.200
She's a friend of our family.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.640
I mean, our show is our family.

31:12.640 --> 31:17.520
For a free audiobook of your choice and a free 30-day trial membership, go to Audiblepodcast.com

31:17.520 --> 31:19.280

31:19.280 --> 31:24.160
That's audiblepodcast.com slash, all one word, My Brother.

31:24.160 --> 31:27.760
So do that and let them know of our power.

31:28.320 --> 31:34.240
But it's hard with a book to, hold on, I can do this.

31:34.800 --> 31:35.680
Get it.

31:35.680 --> 31:41.760
If it was a real book that Audible gave you, like physical, you shouldn't put your dick

31:41.760 --> 31:46.400
inside between the pages and shut the book and then try to fuck that, because it would

31:46.400 --> 31:47.840
not feel great.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.760
But because it's an audiobook, that's cool?

31:50.560 --> 31:54.720
No, I was just trying to transition into Extreme Restraints.

31:54.720 --> 31:59.600
Sometimes when I listen to the Audible reading of Huck Finn, I just jerk it.

31:59.600 --> 32:06.320
Okay, we're not going to do this to our friends at Audible.com, but what I will say is Extreme

32:06.320 --> 32:10.000
Restraints.com is my choice for things to fuck with.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.400
Well, not just with, but things to fuck with, fuck on.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.520
Fuck on, fuck near.

32:15.520 --> 32:19.600
Fuck, fuck up, fuck down, fuck side to side.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.560
Fuck adjacent to.

32:21.120 --> 32:21.840
Whatever, man.

32:21.840 --> 32:22.560
Whatever you want to do.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.400
Fuck any proposition you want.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.040
Doing the electric slide.

32:31.360 --> 32:32.160
So we just got it.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.360
Now Charlie Brown.

32:33.360 --> 32:36.240
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

33:09.200 --> 33:09.440
Yep.

33:09.440 --> 33:12.640
You're going to find so much room you didn't even know you had.

33:12.640 --> 33:17.920
This is so, they are a small company based in Huntington Beach.

33:17.920 --> 33:20.320
They love our show and we love them.

33:20.320 --> 33:21.920
They've been a long time.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.760
They have, think about this for a second.

33:23.760 --> 33:28.640
ExtremeRestraints.com has supported this program more than anyone you know.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.560
More than anybody on earth.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.200
Like combined.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.920
ExtremeRestraints.com has made this show possible.

33:33.920 --> 33:39.840
I just found out very excited that they're going to be sending us a box of some samples.

33:39.840 --> 33:40.640
So I was curious.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.240
Have you guys decided what you're going to?

33:42.960 --> 33:45.760
I'm thinking just grab bag this time.

33:45.760 --> 33:46.720
Just surprise me.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.320
Now be careful with the grab bag.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.320
It is more painful than it sounds.

33:51.920 --> 33:53.440
I've ordered a gumdrop bar.

33:53.440 --> 33:54.960
I'm just going to see how that works out.

33:54.960 --> 33:58.160
It's a gumdrop bar for your dick.

33:59.680 --> 34:02.480
It's a pain box that you lower your balls into.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.240
Fear is the mind killer.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.440
I must not be a fear.

34:05.440 --> 34:06.560
Oh god my balls.

34:07.520 --> 34:14.560
ExtremeRestraints.com is obsessed with finding the one object that will cause you genital pain

34:14.560 --> 34:16.640
but no pleasure to anyone.

34:16.640 --> 34:19.040
So far they have not managed.

34:19.040 --> 34:22.320
If you envision the site as that ongoing experiment.

34:22.320 --> 34:28.480
Just the floatsome and jetsome from one man's quest to find something that will hurt your

34:28.480 --> 34:30.240
dick but won't turn you on.

34:30.240 --> 34:36.000
Yeah their newest edition is the puzzle box from Hellraiser.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.840
Just have demons just tear your dick and body into shreds.

34:39.840 --> 34:44.080
And then some weirdo in Des Moines was like yes mama do likey.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.280
So it's for sale now.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.800
You can buy it because he hates it so much.

34:48.800 --> 34:51.600
There's only one of everything that's not true.

34:51.600 --> 34:55.040
None of the things we've said for the past minute are true but here's what is true.

34:55.040 --> 34:57.200
You gotta fuck and it's going to make it better.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.480

34:58.480 --> 35:03.600
Use the coupon code sexygarfield all one word for 20% off.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.200
It's a dot com I fucked up.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.080
It's disappointing.

35:06.080 --> 35:10.720
It's upsettingly discreet I would say because I really want I don't give a fuck.

35:10.720 --> 35:13.040
I want the neighbors to be like oh they're fucking right.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.840
Yeah look at them they got a dildo shaped box.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.040
Hi this is Biz.

35:19.040 --> 35:19.920
And I'm Teresa.

35:19.920 --> 35:25.040
And we host a new show about the epic fails and genius moments of being a mom.

35:25.040 --> 35:29.840

Join us every week to find out.

35:31.280 --> 35:35.120

Subscribe for free on iTunes or go to MaximumFun.org.

35:40.720 --> 35:45.200
I'm pretty staunchly opposed to piracy but one of my close friends uses this as his number

35:45.200 --> 35:47.680
one avenue for accessing his movies and music.

35:47.680 --> 35:51.200
He often enters into conversations with me about why he thinks piracy is right

35:51.200 --> 35:54.240
and offers completely unjustified reasons for his standpoint.

35:54.240 --> 35:58.720
In favor of not getting into an argument over something so trivial I tend to just end the

35:58.720 --> 36:02.160
conversation as soon as possible but I feel this leaves him thinking he has the upper hand

36:02.160 --> 36:06.240
and he is on occasion feels free to remind me I couldn't come back with a better argument

36:06.240 --> 36:06.880
and he is right.

36:07.520 --> 36:13.280
Is it better to just take his banal arguments or should I make my stand in hopes of ending

36:13.280 --> 36:18.720
his prattling on and that's from Sincerely Plundered in San Jose.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.640
I am sick of this discussion.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.040
Piracy is evil.

36:23.040 --> 36:27.840
They make people walk the plank, they take people's booty, they're sinking ships all

36:27.840 --> 36:30.720
over the Spanish main and I am sick of it.

36:32.160 --> 36:39.520
My dad, my father, made gold doubloons for 30 years in his workshop.

36:39.520 --> 36:43.200
You're taking food out of his children who is me's mouth.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.560
I think there's an alternate solution to this problem and that is to call the cops on your

36:48.560 --> 36:53.360
shitty friend and get him thrown in jail.

36:53.360 --> 36:54.320
Is there a hotline?

36:54.320 --> 36:58.160
Is there something I can do to be like hey my friend got that Hobbit movie on the DL.

36:58.160 --> 36:59.200
Please take him away.

36:59.200 --> 37:05.040
Do you know how sweet it would be if you lured your friend into an argument and you get him

37:05.040 --> 37:09.760
to detail all of his piracy and then at the end you're like I guess you're right and then

37:09.760 --> 37:16.320
you pull out a micro recorder and you pull out the flower and the flower on your jacket,

37:16.320 --> 37:21.440
on your jacket, the comically large flower that turns out was a microphone the whole

37:21.440 --> 37:21.760
time.

37:21.760 --> 37:22.800
You've been the Wired.

37:23.440 --> 37:24.800
You got me again Bobby.

37:24.800 --> 37:28.400
That's all that the show The Wire is by the way if you haven't seen The Wire.

37:28.400 --> 37:33.200
It's just about a man hiding a wire on his body and being like so you stole those bowling

37:33.200 --> 37:34.480
shoes from the alley huh?

37:34.480 --> 37:35.120
Yeah I did.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.000
What's it to you?

37:36.000 --> 37:39.840
It's not to me but tell to the judge and he pulls his shirt off.

37:39.840 --> 37:43.440
And the best part is that man is in no way affiliated with any kind of law enforcement.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.760
And every, every, this is like a freelance wire.

37:45.760 --> 37:49.520
Every week he hides the wire in a different place so like he takes off and it's up to

37:49.520 --> 37:50.240
you to find it out.

37:50.240 --> 37:55.200
He takes off his Jamiroquai hat and there's a tiny stenographer under there.

37:56.080 --> 37:59.040
You know that under Jamiroquai has a smaller hat.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.240
God what a great guy.

38:00.240 --> 38:01.920
I bet he starts every concert that way.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.440
Hold on let me get more comfortable.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.080
What does he sound like that?

38:06.800 --> 38:07.200
I don't know.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.200
Why is he eating a mouthful of cheese?

38:09.200 --> 38:14.160
I don't know if he's British or Jamaican or a mouse so I made it all of them combined.

38:14.160 --> 38:23.120
Um man I don't uh it's hard to have a conversation with anybody about piracy ever because there's

38:23.120 --> 38:26.640
a lot of companies that really have it coming to them.

38:26.640 --> 38:27.760
You know what I mean?

38:27.760 --> 38:29.600
Yeah corpse.

38:30.240 --> 38:35.040
But at the same time like I don't I haven't pirated music since I was in college I think.

38:35.840 --> 38:41.200
Um and that's just like I don't want to get holier than thou because really if it wasn't

38:41.200 --> 38:44.880
for Spotify who knows like who knows where I would have landed.

38:44.880 --> 38:50.880
I mean that's but that's a great point like there are companies out there like Spotify

38:50.880 --> 38:53.760
and now I've forgotten the other ones.

38:55.280 --> 38:56.160
What's the other ones?

38:58.720 --> 39:00.240
Where you can get the music from them?

39:01.120 --> 39:05.520
Like those catalogs that you get in the magazine and you get six free CDs and then you have

39:05.520 --> 39:06.080
to like sell them to your friends.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.120
Oh you fucking know what I'm talking about.

39:07.120 --> 39:07.840
Don't be a dick.

39:08.880 --> 39:09.380
Come on.

39:09.380 --> 39:15.940
There's uh my my neighbor uh Suzanne she uh she just sings a lot.

39:17.620 --> 39:19.620
She sings while she gardens it's really nice.

39:20.260 --> 39:23.220
Anyways but there are things out there that will give you.

39:23.220 --> 39:27.140
Sometimes a car drives down the street and they've got their their radio turned up really

39:27.140 --> 39:31.060
loud so you get like it's on my phone you get like a few free sets sometimes you can

39:31.060 --> 39:36.100
just like whistle yourself a tune and that's free music so maybe you make your own music.

39:36.100 --> 39:40.660
Listen to this it's a free song for you guys it's called T.M.S.

39:40.660 --> 39:41.940
T.M.T.M.T.M.

39:41.940 --> 39:43.700
Do not redistribute it.

39:44.340 --> 39:53.220
Can I say I uh I I I think that this argument is probably the most boring one you can have

39:53.220 --> 39:56.980
and I've fallen into it uh 150,000 times.

39:56.980 --> 40:02.740
Here's the here's the only thing you can say right yeah I've done it too because everybody

40:02.740 --> 40:05.780
has in their entire life please don't say you haven't.

40:05.780 --> 40:09.380
But I try not to because it's I don't think it's right it's just a personal thing you

40:09.380 --> 40:15.460
don't have to convert anyone to believe anything trust me the problem doesn't get any better

40:15.460 --> 40:20.020
at all if you convince the person that it's stealing if they can't like use their they're

40:20.020 --> 40:27.300
not unless you set up a Christmas carol type situation with musicians and movie stars from

40:27.300 --> 40:31.700
the past present and future to sit there and come to your friend at night and tell him

40:31.700 --> 40:32.420
what to do.

40:32.420 --> 40:35.780
Hey hey I'm Moby I want to came to talk to you about some of your habits.

40:37.940 --> 40:43.700
Come with me this is my car that I have to drive now because you stole all my music and

40:43.700 --> 40:50.340

41:27.540 --> 41:33.300
I think I would seek help no I think I have some other issues to work out who cares who

41:33.300 --> 41:39.060
gives a shit it's not worth it it's like your dorm is twitter like just quit it no one gives

41:39.060 --> 41:45.860
a crap I will say I had a roommate and I'm not going to name names Jacob Dunkel oh it

41:45.860 --> 41:50.100
slipped out Dunkel I'm sorry let's say Jacob Dunkel Dunkel I'm sorry keep putting you

41:50.100 --> 41:57.460
on blast but Dunkel lives in the same town as me Griffin has moved and whenever I see

41:57.460 --> 42:02.180
Dunkel that's all he'll say why do you put me on blast don't go I'm sorry you put me

42:02.180 --> 42:06.340
on blast but youthful indiscretions we're safe in the annals of time Dunkel's just trying

42:06.340 --> 42:12.420
to stay on with the radar I can't go back to prison Dunkel's not going back to prison

42:12.420 --> 42:16.900
Dunkel got hit up by the survive another stretch Dunkel got hit up by whatever that whatever

42:16.900 --> 42:22.100
that anti-piracy thing is who went and did all the suing of all the college students

42:22.660 --> 42:27.540
gave him a formal warning for downloading for downloading feature films in their defense he

42:27.540 --> 42:34.500
pirated more shit than any other 10 people I know combined but he got hit up because he downloaded

42:34.500 --> 42:39.380
I think it was like Mulholland Drive or something he got he got dinged he got dinged by the by the

42:39.380 --> 42:46.100
motion picture association of America so like it does happen I mean they'll keep an eye on it

42:46.100 --> 42:50.660
I hope those guys are just torn at things because they were there like you might want to watch them

42:50.660 --> 42:54.980
someday why do you have Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 in Spanish I don't I don't know

42:56.660 --> 43:02.020
I have a real problem it's only half of it and it's it's they actually it's homemade somebody

43:02.020 --> 43:07.380
did a shot for shot homemade like in Be Kind Rewind which I also pirated in Dutch this is a

43:07.380 --> 43:14.580
sweetened version of uh Sisterhood that's what fans call it I hope he's okay I hope he didn't

43:14.580 --> 43:20.820
I hope he's not incarcerated I hope they didn't get him he's not he's not on the inside he's fine

43:24.180 --> 43:30.420
probably not still but he was dead Griffin I need a yahoo here's a yahoo answer is sent in by um

43:30.420 --> 43:37.220
oh god all of them are Ira Ray come on Ira Ray you're the best um it's my yahoo answer

43:37.220 --> 43:40.900
somebody's listening to the show the other day somebody treated the other day asking if we just

43:40.900 --> 43:45.220
use his questions so we could do the theme song no we keep like I don't want to discourage everybody

43:45.220 --> 43:49.860
else who's sending in questions because like they're all great and I appreciate it and uh

43:49.860 --> 43:54.260
like I do I read everyone that people send in a week and I do not mean to put you all down but

43:54.260 --> 44:00.740
Ira Ray's are just they're superb they're so good um Ira Ray thank you it's by yahoo answers user

44:00.740 --> 44:07.540
question mark who asks did the popularity of the Karate Kid basically ruin the effectiveness of the

44:07.540 --> 44:13.460
crane kick since now everyone will know what's coming when you get in the crane kick position

44:13.460 --> 44:18.980
and the element of surprise is gone has the crane kick become an extinct move do martial arts experts

44:18.980 --> 44:23.220
not like the Karate Kid for ruining the crane kick in the way magician magicians don't like

44:23.220 --> 44:31.300
other magicians who reveal their secrets so by this person's logic if anyone has ever done the

44:31.300 --> 44:38.740
crane kick once uh-huh it is no publicly publicly it's well not even that because the person who

44:38.740 --> 44:44.260
receives who's on the receiving end of the cake they tell two friends they tell two friends and

44:44.260 --> 44:49.380
then they two sell two friends and pretty sure soon it's you know the fucking t-fury's printing

44:49.380 --> 44:54.020
on t-shirts like all right I bet it's more of a thing like when somebody gets in the crane

44:54.020 --> 44:58.500
kick position at a meet or competition or whatever the judges just like roll their eyes

44:58.500 --> 45:03.860
uh fuck you if I was the judge of a martial arts contest and I saw somebody get in the

45:03.860 --> 45:09.220
crane kick competition I would be the most excited for anything I've ever been in the

45:09.220 --> 45:13.780
better question is how sick do you think officials are at those meets of people yelling sweep the

45:13.780 --> 45:20.260
leg like literally every time every has to be right three minutes has to be ladies and gentlemen

45:20.260 --> 45:26.420
welcome first and foremost we ask you please don't yell sweep the leg we fucking get it we

45:26.420 --> 45:32.660
have all in fact seeing karate kid you are very funny please do not say see the leg also not

45:32.660 --> 45:40.740
allowed put him in a body bag that is done also i never die is out also uh later on this evening

45:40.740 --> 45:46.020
we do have a roller derby bout happening here they have as that you not shot whip it everybody

45:46.020 --> 45:53.780
thank you please thank you i'm jb miller i'm huntington radio personality and deep deep

45:53.780 --> 46:01.060
in joke jb miller god fuck you guys so a little i'm huntington wall of famer jb miller and now

46:01.060 --> 46:08.180
a little reference for no one jb miller so let's jb miller is awesome by the way he's a great great

46:08.180 --> 46:13.700
he's just fun to impersonate him he has a great radio voice just google him listen come on people

46:14.580 --> 46:20.420
hashtag jb miller you get in a fight with someone at a bar we'll call we'll call this

46:20.420 --> 46:28.340
someone jb miller for all intents and purposes would you be hero to millions jb miller arcs

46:28.340 --> 46:33.940
one of his legs up bends his knee upwards lifts that leg up while the other leg is planted firmly

46:33.940 --> 46:40.100
on the ground slightly bent and puts his two arms up as if he is flapping his arms like a bird

46:40.100 --> 46:47.540
if you have not seen and are not even aware of the karate kid i still think you can assume

46:47.540 --> 46:53.140
like oh that kick is coming like that that physically i should lean slightly back like

46:53.140 --> 46:58.900
you have exposed yourself in a way and prevented one of your legs from moving in a way that the

46:58.900 --> 47:04.660
only thing that can mean is that the other leg's coming up face words you know be great i think

47:04.660 --> 47:10.820
there's somebody did that to me in a bar yes my first thought would be to like just punch them

47:10.820 --> 47:16.180
because they've left themselves very vulnerable and open alternatively just push them gently and

47:16.180 --> 47:22.980
they'll fall right over but i'm gonna be honest i would let it happen just to see how they did it

47:22.980 --> 47:26.900
because there's got to be like 90 percent of people that do that have to be like don't worry i

47:26.900 --> 47:31.860
saw this on karate kid right and then they're gonna do it and just fall on their fucking faces

47:31.860 --> 47:36.900
yeah but there's gonna be 10 of people yeah that are just gonna it would be worth it to take that

47:36.900 --> 47:42.820
kick just to see this just to see this bad boy unfold i'm just saying like it'd be it'd be you're

47:42.820 --> 47:46.580
like on the ground with your nose bleeding so it's like oh what happened like that guy just fucking

47:46.580 --> 47:51.460
crane kicked to know that he nailed it even if that person like said some really racist shit

47:51.460 --> 47:57.700
and like you know poured an entire beer on your friend or girlfriend and like it was a total jerk

47:57.700 --> 48:04.260
and you know you desperately wanted to fight him i would let that happen just so that he can have

48:04.260 --> 48:11.540
that story the chance to give somebody a gift that magical it never comes along and to yeah and to

48:11.540 --> 48:15.460
just like i would lay on the ground and he would bend over and be like thank you i'll be like pay

48:15.460 --> 48:21.940
it forward grandson granddaughter come here allow papa to tell you of the time he gave the greatest

48:21.940 --> 48:31.380
gift kick it forward you you have to let three other people crank kick you in the face and it's

48:31.380 --> 48:37.700
not a very good now and now let me die peacefully the conversion rate is not very good i know what

48:37.700 --> 48:42.500
if the guy who originally crank kicked him came back like at the end of late miss iraq when he's

48:42.500 --> 48:49.380
on his deathbed he's gonna kick you into infinity now i thought you'd forgotten about me i never

48:49.380 --> 48:56.900
forgot the secret was it was the best moment of my life too and i'm gonna die also but i want to

48:56.900 --> 49:04.740
die and then they kick each other and it's like perfectly time so they both go flying back and

49:04.740 --> 49:09.380
they freeze in midair and their outlines form a heart it's like the end of d3

49:11.540 --> 49:14.660
and they just crank kick each other freeze frame

49:16.420 --> 49:26.100
stephen sodberg filmed the end before box office smash i wish i'd been there the first time that

49:26.900 --> 49:32.580
somebody was crank kicking somebody when that when that prior art in the crane kicking case was

49:32.580 --> 49:40.180
uh was created because i would imagine that probably looked ridiculous because the implication

49:40.180 --> 49:48.580
of the crane kick is that i can't stand on one leg without falling over unless i am balancing

49:48.580 --> 49:54.660
with my hands so it seems to me you could do a crane kick well i i don't think that's actually

49:54.660 --> 49:58.500
yeah i don't think it is a i don't think it has anything to do with physics i think it has

49:58.500 --> 50:05.620
something to do with birds with large wingspans are terrifying how about because here's the thing

50:05.620 --> 50:09.220
like i think that you're the opponent and you see it happen you're like whoa whoa whoa where

50:09.220 --> 50:13.620
daniel's son go suddenly there's a bird here and then you're kicked yeah yeah you see you see a

50:13.620 --> 50:19.700
flamingo and you're like big fucking deal skinny ass legs it's pink this is no this is no trouble

50:19.700 --> 50:24.180
at all i can fucking wreck this bird they get those wings out and you're like nope nope nope

50:24.180 --> 50:29.140
nope nope nope out now griffin you know it's not called the flamingo kick right no like you

50:29.140 --> 50:34.580
could have said crane but i am talking about another large goofy ass looking bird of prey

50:35.540 --> 50:40.500
and then he did the heron he wanted to go with ostriches but ostriches are objectively terrifying

50:41.380 --> 50:45.860
well they have judgmental faces yeah well that's not why i was i was more talking about the fact

50:45.860 --> 50:51.780
that they have fucking velociraptor talons but oh yeah i guess i guess that also doesn't help

50:51.780 --> 50:58.340
this is a two-part question okay and i put them together because i wanted to close on this very

50:58.340 --> 51:02.740
important point that we apparently have not made yet and i wanted one last chance to make it

51:04.340 --> 51:09.220
here's the first question i'm a mid-20s guy who lives in a suburban area and i have trouble

51:09.220 --> 51:14.500
meeting women my age around here however there's one girl who lives nearby who seems like she could

51:14.500 --> 51:19.700
be really cool her sister and brother-in-law are good friends of mine and i've met and i met her

51:19.700 --> 51:24.420
through them the problem is i only met her once a while ago and aside from recently becoming

51:24.420 --> 51:29.860
facebook friends exchanging the occasional like or comment have hardly interacted with her since

51:29.860 --> 51:34.740
my question is this how can i find some way to hang out with her again i don't know her well

51:34.740 --> 51:40.340
enough to ask her out but i'd like to get to know her in a more casual setting my friends rarely

51:40.340 --> 51:44.660
come to the area and when they do they usually just hang out with her and her family not me

51:44.660 --> 51:50.260
what's a creative non-creepy way to cross paths with her again see if she's cool as i hope she is

51:50.260 --> 51:57.060
that's from hangout hopeful here's another here's another question okay next weekend i'll be going

51:57.060 --> 52:02.180
to an event with some friends that should be totally awesome but i've just been informed

52:02.180 --> 52:06.340
that my mutual friend that one of the people i'll be rooming with is secretly pining for me

52:06.340 --> 52:11.220
and thinks i feel the same i like spending time with him but i don't have any romantic feelings

52:11.220 --> 52:15.540
and i don't want to give him the wrong idea should i give him a heads up and risk making him really

52:15.540 --> 52:20.820
uncomfortable or should i wait to see if he brings up the topic on his own and that's from from

52:20.820 --> 52:27.540
perplexed packs goer is what are we doing both of these together because they both represent

52:27.540 --> 52:33.780
opposite ends of i just when i read these two actually like in sequence travis i happen to

52:33.780 --> 52:38.340
star them and they're of course not related obviously these people are not the same people

52:38.340 --> 52:43.300
they're not regarding the same problem but we we used to hit on this a lot during the show

52:43.300 --> 52:50.500
and i and i really i want to circle back around to it jokes aside and really try to hit this home

52:50.500 --> 52:59.140
okay this conniving and the strategies and the oh yeah and the like trying to make you guys are

52:59.140 --> 53:08.980
fake you have a name your facebook friends you've liked each other's just ask her dummy just say do

53:08.980 --> 53:16.500
you want to go out sometime and stop wasting your life minutes trying to come up with a way to make

53:16.500 --> 53:20.180
yourself more comfortable with that because that's all you're really doing i mean well yeah what

53:20.180 --> 53:24.660
you're doing is you're trying to recreate like a romantic comedy moment right exactly oh hey

53:24.660 --> 53:29.860
didn't expect you to be at the driving range we didn't have a meet cute so now i want to try to

53:29.860 --> 53:36.420
create one when like if you've here here's the question that i don't think people people are

53:36.420 --> 53:40.260
amazing and they're worthwhile and i think everybody listening to the show right now

53:40.260 --> 53:45.380
is worthwhile you're cool and funny and and worth you have great taste you have great taste in

53:45.380 --> 53:51.220
podcast gotten fucking your sexy body you have fucking especially look at you in that mustang

53:51.220 --> 53:57.220
costume cutting down carbs you you're great if you could develop feelings for this person even

53:57.220 --> 54:03.460
sort of the first inkling the first spark of feelings why why do you make the assumption

54:03.460 --> 54:09.060
that there's no way this person could be thinking the same you know why simultaneously if you're

54:09.060 --> 54:15.540
wanting to get to know them the way that you do that is by asking them out and spending time with

54:15.540 --> 54:21.380
them we like there's there's no time clock that you gotta punch and get like 10 hours credit before

54:21.380 --> 54:26.500
you can ask let me let me tell everybody where we are as a civilization this is where we are

54:26.500 --> 54:33.780
where i feel like for a good long while there like back in the the the you know soda shop days

54:33.780 --> 54:40.100
the custom was hey i met you and i liked you and this is crazy but here's my number so call me call

54:40.100 --> 54:45.620
me maybe no it was i met you i found you interesting let's spend more time together to

54:45.620 --> 54:50.980
get to know each other and then maybe we can procreate by the time we're 17 and that became

54:50.980 --> 54:57.460
such that was the norm and then all of a sudden it wasn't anymore and it did become about this

54:57.460 --> 55:01.700
conniving and trying to find ways and trying to be too cool for school and trying to sneak

55:01.700 --> 55:08.740
sneak your way into love and now i feel like the people who can fucking get up the courage to say

55:08.740 --> 55:14.340
hey i think you're interesting i want to get to know you better let's go on a date like that has

55:14.340 --> 55:19.220
come back into fashion now and like if you can pull that move off it doesn't matter if they say

55:19.220 --> 55:24.740
yes or no they're gonna think you're fucking cool well i know dudes like my friend john sheller is

55:24.740 --> 55:31.860
is one of the smoothest guys and i really think the whole trick to that is that he just says what

55:31.860 --> 55:37.940
he's thinking to women it doesn't he's a very nice confident good-looking guy who just like

55:37.940 --> 55:42.660
grows up and he's like hey how's it going i like there's no pretense or something i don't even

55:42.660 --> 55:49.620
think it has anything to do with charm or intellect or anything it is just having that fraction of

55:49.620 --> 55:55.220
courage required to say i think you're interesting and i want to get to know you better literally

55:55.220 --> 55:59.860
no what i'm saying is that that is what comes across as charm it's not though having that

55:59.860 --> 56:04.980
curry but i'm saying that if you have that courage and you're confident and you can do it that comes

56:04.980 --> 56:10.820
across as being one of the charming guys if you try to if you try to fucking sneak it in sideways

56:10.820 --> 56:17.300
though you're gonna come off as a creep you're gonna be arrested well no you know what i mean

56:17.300 --> 56:24.580
you know like no you're absolutely imagine imagine uh dating imagine you're a car dealership okay

56:25.220 --> 56:30.820
you are a used car all right and that is not a great analogy just hang with me hang with me

56:30.820 --> 56:37.780
okay if you show up in the car salesman you see a car like over in the corner the car salesman's

56:37.780 --> 56:43.620
like i can't show you that one i don't think you're ready to like it yet i have to i have to

56:43.620 --> 56:49.060
apply you a bit what kind of vibe are you gonna get about that car the answer is not a good vibe

56:49.060 --> 56:53.700
but if as soon as you show up at the dealership the guy's like never mind you know what i have

56:53.700 --> 56:58.500
the car for you this is a great car you're gonna love this car that's confidence and that's

56:58.500 --> 57:03.620
appealing that that we like that we we like to think that anybody else knows what the fuck

57:03.620 --> 57:09.940
they're doing because we certainly do not confidence that's all confidence is is holding

57:09.940 --> 57:14.900
up your end of the social bargain to pretend like you know what's going on because none of us do

57:14.900 --> 57:20.580
i'm saying that's right it is so uncommon to be to be straightforward with somebody when it comes

57:20.580 --> 57:27.620
to when it comes to dating it's so rare that when you pull it off it's like seeing it's like seeing

57:27.620 --> 57:32.660
a fucking unicorn it's like holy shit like i don't know how i feel about you but yeah sure

57:32.660 --> 57:38.340
i i got asked on a date can you fucking believe it and he did you know he didn't do it on a text

57:38.340 --> 57:45.460
message can you fucking believe it the crazy thing about it is like the it's it's also doesn't have

57:45.460 --> 57:50.340
to mean like coming across as desperate or doing that like that i think that's what people are

57:50.340 --> 57:55.220
afraid they will seem like if there's like hey you're pretty you know what i mean but like just

57:55.220 --> 58:01.620
do it you don't say hey you're pretty or hey the shampoo you use smells good you say hey i think

58:01.620 --> 58:05.380
you're interesting and i want to get to know you better do you want to hang out sometime never

58:05.380 --> 58:10.820
start a sentence with you probably get this a lot but don't say that no don't say i know i don't

58:10.820 --> 58:18.340
look like much don't uh-huh i know we just met no or i don't want to seem creepy but i don't want

58:18.340 --> 58:24.100
to nope stop doing that don't don't apologize for yourself don't make excuses for yourself i know

58:24.100 --> 58:31.860
i know i have a half-formed vestigial twin hanging off of my neck but you just don't even acknowledge

58:31.860 --> 58:37.940
it let them bring it up let them if you have a half-formed vestigial twin on your neck that can

58:37.940 --> 58:45.140
talk if you still straightforwardly ask somebody else they're gonna say yes i'm gonna take a drink

58:45.140 --> 58:51.060
of water while your twin sings river you okay so you but we've been paying a lot of attention the

58:51.060 --> 58:55.620
first half of the question though no but this is that what i'm saying is the two are connected

58:55.620 --> 59:02.020
because well the second one doesn't want to go out the one breeds the situation though what i'm

59:02.020 --> 59:06.660
saying is it makes the first cause and effect it's cause and effect the first breeds a second

59:06.660 --> 59:12.180
situation where you're actively making the person uncomfortable it's bad for both parties to create

59:12.180 --> 59:21.860
this uh you know to to you know create this weird pre-dating phase that like just ask you just ask

59:21.860 --> 59:24.980
and if it doesn't work out cool maybe you can be friends afterwards and you don't have to spend

59:24.980 --> 59:30.100
another night thinking about it here's the secret you wonder the secret i'm gonna let you guys hear

59:30.100 --> 59:34.500
that book the secret of course you didn't read it so i'm gonna tell you what the secret is you're

59:34.500 --> 59:41.460
ready no matter what you look like bruce willis is dead at the end no matter what you look like

59:41.460 --> 59:47.860
and no matter what the person doing the asking looks like getting ass out on a date makes you

59:47.860 --> 59:58.660
horny i do not care this is irrefutable fucking irrefutable when you get ass on a date it makes

59:58.660 --> 01:00:04.740
you horny because you think oh i can have sex with this person maybe it doesn't matter who you are

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:12.740
or what you look like or any of it getting ass on a date makes you feel good and usually well don't

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:17.860
backpedal because you just made it sound like a hundred percent of the time it always makes you

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:23.780
horny always so if you can go to someone and you say hey do you want to go out on a date they may

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:31.460
say no but they will also say thank you for making me horny i'm gonna go use this i'm gonna go use

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:38.260
this on someone else i'm gonna store this up cashed in later with my husband i'm gonna bank

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:44.260
it i'm gonna ask my husband um i just want a short answer to the person in the perplexed

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:48.900
packs goer i don't think you have to bring it up as long as you have not done anything that is

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:54.580
misleading yeah then if this dude has feelings i mean i would be straightforward with them though

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:59.780
just as a courtesy like you don't want him spending the entire trip like trying to yeah but i also

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:03.140
don't know how you bring that up if you're like hey dave just so you know before we get on this

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:09.380
road trip i don't have feelings for you all right pack it up everybody let's roll out did you get

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:14.980
the cheetos got the cheetos cool we're good to roll you want to sit in the back with me nope uh

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:22.420
you're crying fuck the the best thing you can give somebody is your time and by asking someone on a

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:27.620
date you say to them i think you met there's a chance you could be the person i want to give all

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:32.660
my time to i don't care what you look like or if you're a dirt bag or any of it that's that's a

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:39.220
nice thing to say to somebody even if nothing ever comes of it okay nothing ever comes of it

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:44.340
you have still done something nice for them and made yourself a bit more confident and a bit more

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:50.420
used to getting you know if you if you are rejected and you know what if you're rejecting

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:55.380
it's based on nothing because the person doesn't know you so it's nothing to feel bad about if you

01:01:55.380 --> 01:02:00.420
uh say mooch a bunch of a girl's money off of her so you can keep visiting her and then you leave

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:04.340
her and don't give her because you really like traveling to new york city like that's your

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:09.700
business that's your business no that uh it's it's a great thing to ask somebody out it's nice

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:16.100
and it's not weird and it's how society has operated for so long don't make it into a big

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:21.380
thing don't like that's what i'm saying you got a cool hand lucet because your friends if you ask

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:25.380
if you ask out somebody that your friends know they're going to make both of you try and feel

01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:29.940
weird about it because people are fucking dicks and you just gotta be like i don't man just calm

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:35.060
down you know we're just we're just hanging out and just spend some time together just see if we

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:40.500
see if we are simpatico and if you could say it in that kind of tone and when you say it like lower

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:47.380
your sunglasses down your face then uh let me do this other favor for you if you say do you want

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:53.540
to go out sometime and the person says i don't know let me think about it you rescind that offer

01:02:53.540 --> 01:03:00.340
yep so fast that you do not have time to even let the like they don't even finish the sentence

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:03.540
you listen as long as we're making big broad strokes i'm going to throw this out too because

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:09.220
we get this question once a week i'm worried if you schedule a date with someone and then they

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:15.220
tell you uh no like call you 30 minutes beforehand and they're like uh no i just it turns out that i

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:21.380
gotta get a wisdom tooth out at 9 pm or whatever can we reschedule it and then they reschedule it

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:27.700
and then they cancel on you again no don't even don't even do the second one yeah whoa don't even

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:35.060
do that if they can't suffer a rotten lightning pain in their mouth to spend time with you then

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:40.260
if they love you they set you free and then you run away and that's how you that's how they know

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:45.700
they fucked up is how i the same people's misguided attempt to try to like let you down easy by

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:50.340
stringing you along it's fucking bullshit if they wanted to go out with you they would find the time

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:55.300
to people say dating stop asking me that people say dating is so hard and it's not it's the shit

01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:00.420
that happens right before the dating starts that sucks so everything that you do to prolong that

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:07.780
shittiness is is not a favor yeah so let me say this to the other side if somebody asks you out

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:13.620
and you don't want to go out with them say like oh no thank you but i'd rather not booyah i mean

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:17.860
you don't necessarily need no i'm sorry sorry offering you an order you have to say booyah

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:26.420
i just ask if you rejected that's fine the hundredth time you get rejected i'm gonna feel it

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.940
and then you'll be that cool guy that gets dates all the time if you're not asking if you're not

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:35.780
like i some dude i know like a couple months ago said to me like i just i can't seem to stay with

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:40.260
a girl i can't find the one i can't all these relationships end and it's like yeah because

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:46.340
they will until they don't anymore and then you marry that person like it's not this magical thing

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:52.260
we're like oh i bumped into this girl on the subway married right like there's a half can you

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:58.980
walk me through that again i ran into a girl on the subway wait i think my reaction was she fell

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:05.780
on the tracks oh my god someone help her that's why why did you run the subway i bumped her off

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:10.580
the platform that's my future wife down there that's somebody called a fixer
