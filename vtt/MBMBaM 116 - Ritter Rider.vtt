00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.320 --> 00:50.640
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me. We're welcoming back

00:51.280 --> 00:54.880
international advice correspondent Griffin McElroy from the-

00:54.880 --> 00:56.240
Guten Morgen!

00:56.240 --> 00:59.280
From the shining, the sandy shores of Germany.

01:00.640 --> 01:01.120
Beach, beachy-

01:01.120 --> 01:03.680
My, my name is Griffin.

01:03.680 --> 01:04.160
Wow.

01:04.160 --> 01:08.160
That's, they don't say my over there, they say mine. It's like the most confusing thing

01:08.160 --> 01:10.720
about their language and culture, other than everything.

01:10.720 --> 01:16.880
Some of the, now Griffin, did you enjoy any international cuisine?

01:17.680 --> 01:22.720
I ate, I ate literally the same kind of schnitzel two days in a row.

01:22.720 --> 01:23.040
Okay.

01:23.040 --> 01:27.440
That's sort of my, my steez when it comes to international travel. Keep in mind,

01:27.440 --> 01:32.480
this is the first time that I've done it. So I was really sort of setting the boundaries for

01:32.480 --> 01:38.000
myself, but I ate schnitzel with mushroom sauce and french fries on it. And then I,

01:38.000 --> 01:41.120
second night, like night right after that, I was like, yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and have

01:41.120 --> 01:41.680
that same thing.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.080
Now, Griffin, you didn't drink the water over there, did you?

01:44.800 --> 01:46.160
They don't have the water, actually.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.360
They don't have any water.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.680
It's, it's all distilled locker.

01:49.680 --> 01:55.280
It's like Dubai over there. It's pretty crazy. Now, Griffin, many people on this podcast think

01:55.280 --> 01:58.320
that schnitzel is like a crepe or burrito because they're-

01:58.320 --> 02:01.200
You're an idiot if you think that. If you think it's a sausage-

02:01.200 --> 02:03.760
I know it's like a breaded, like a pork chop.

02:03.760 --> 02:06.560
I literally had to tell Travis what it was right before we started this call.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.560
Damn it, Griffin, you weren't supposed to tell him.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.280
I don't know. I still don't know. You haven't cleared it up for me at all.

02:11.280 --> 02:16.320
It's like a pork chop. It's like a fried, it's like a fried, uh, it's like a, you know how,

02:16.320 --> 02:19.600
uh, you remember when you were a kid and you got, um-

02:19.600 --> 02:20.160
Funnel cake.

02:20.160 --> 02:24.240
Those, no, no, no. You got those, uh, you got those lollipops that were,

02:24.240 --> 02:26.160
you got those lollipops that were also whistles.

02:27.120 --> 02:27.360
Yeah.

02:29.120 --> 02:29.360
Yeah.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.880
It's nothing. It's nothing like that.

02:30.880 --> 02:31.920
Nothing like that. Okay.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.360
You guys remember Nickel Maid?

02:33.360 --> 02:33.680
Yeah.

02:33.680 --> 02:38.000
Look, my, it's not like that either. So let's just process of elimination,

02:38.000 --> 02:40.160
talk about what schnitzel is and is not.

02:40.160 --> 02:40.480
Okay.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.320
In fact, if you could just go through everything that schnitzel is not.

02:44.960 --> 02:45.840
Okay. Let's see.

02:45.840 --> 02:46.160
Welcome.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.080
Taco Bell, anything on the Taco Bell menu.

02:48.080 --> 02:48.480
Okay.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.720
Pizza, uh, hamburgers.

02:50.720 --> 02:55.040
No, these are just food items. You really need to branch out to other things schnitzel isn't.

02:55.040 --> 03:00.080
Oh, you're right. Uh, frisbees, uh, lamp posts, uh, adoption papers.

03:00.080 --> 03:04.320
Are there any, is anything at McDonald's similar to schnitzel?

03:04.880 --> 03:07.280
Let me think, uh, chicken nuggets. I think if you took out the chicken,

03:07.280 --> 03:10.320
although there is chicken schnitzel and then you flatten that shit down and then you made

03:10.320 --> 03:11.360
a germiner.

03:11.360 --> 03:15.440
Yeah. Did the McDonald's in Germany, did they have mixed schnitzel?

03:16.400 --> 03:18.000
Uh, they do only in Dusseldorf.

03:18.880 --> 03:23.200
Something, something royale with cheese.

03:23.200 --> 03:27.920
I had, I had the pleasure of enjoying that when I was in Dusseldorf,

03:27.920 --> 03:31.600
which did you guys know Dusseldorf is German for out of here Jews.

03:32.640 --> 03:36.080
Hold on now. One second. That's not accurate. Is it?

03:36.080 --> 03:36.880
It is.

03:36.880 --> 03:40.800
I do not do is the German root for Jew.

03:41.520 --> 03:46.560
And then, uh, Seldorf is come on, get on out.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.600
Scoot. Hey, why don't you scoot?

03:49.600 --> 03:54.160
So that's the actual official translation. I learned a lot about, um, by the way,

03:54.160 --> 03:56.000
Germans, I'm sorry about that thing.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.640
I said, you, your, your country is beautiful and your people are very efficient.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.600
Can I ask you a serious, not joking question now?

04:03.600 --> 04:04.000
Yes.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.120
How many dudes did you see wearing lederhosen?

04:07.120 --> 04:07.760
Yeah.

04:07.760 --> 04:11.120
There had to be please tell me there was at least one dude.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.480
Here's the thing. I went there for a game convention.

04:15.520 --> 04:19.680
So I did see a bunch of utility kilts, which is like the modern day hosen.

04:19.680 --> 04:26.720
I feel like this is our, uh, advice, podcasts and international bridge building.

04:27.600 --> 04:33.840
Audio seminar, I think is where it's a sort of a cultural, cultural, uh, buffet.

04:33.840 --> 04:37.840
I would say I'm off to Mexico next tomorrow leaving for that.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.320
And I'm trying to drink all the water down there.

04:40.320 --> 04:43.440
Right, right. You're supposed to just gulp it in big heady gulps.

04:43.440 --> 04:47.920
And, um, uh, cause then it just inoculates you so fast is what I've heard.

04:47.920 --> 04:51.600
I read it on TripAdvisor. They said, just dip your head under the water and just

04:51.600 --> 04:53.520
breathe it deep for a few, for a few minutes.

04:53.520 --> 04:57.680
Now, Travis, I do notice Travis that you just said it inaugurates you.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.280
You become the president of Mexico when you drink the water.

05:01.280 --> 05:01.520
Okay.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.000
It changes hands quite often.

05:04.960 --> 05:10.560
Also, I, I read on, uh, on Yahoo Answers funnily enough that, uh, it makes you poop to death.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.760
So that is another consideration.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.920
So that is, that's going to be a lot of fun.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.360
Absent presidents is a big problem.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.680
It's going to be a fun week. Great vacation.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.560
Uh, lose 20 pounds in poop weight.

05:22.560 --> 05:27.120
I recently defended my dissertation and as such can be called doctor.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.800
While I've been looking forward to this, I now find it a bit awkward.

05:31.600 --> 05:37.760
When is it appropriate to introduce myself with or purposefully use my freshly minted title?

05:37.760 --> 05:40.480
And that's from newly doctoral in New Orleans.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.040
Always.

05:43.040 --> 05:43.440
Never.

05:44.000 --> 05:44.640
Sometimes.

05:45.680 --> 05:46.240
Okay.

05:46.240 --> 05:53.360
Well, I, I wonder like, is the, I imagine if I had like a PhD doctorate versus like an MD doctorate,

05:53.360 --> 05:56.720
it's probably really embarrassing when they're like, I'm a doctor and like,

05:56.720 --> 05:58.000
oh, what's your specialty?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.840
And you're like, my history.

05:59.840 --> 06:00.480
Yeah.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.640
Well, I don't think that's embarrassed.

06:02.640 --> 06:07.680
I don't think that being so goddamn smart that you could go to the hardest school.

06:07.680 --> 06:11.120
What if some, what if some dude has a heart attack over in the corner and they're like,

06:11.120 --> 06:12.160
is there a doctor in the house?

06:12.160 --> 06:13.200
You're like, I'm a doctor.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.320
And they're like, save him.

06:14.320 --> 06:17.920
Like, but you wouldn't, but I'll write a real epic essay about him afterwards.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.280
First off, back up.

06:20.080 --> 06:26.160
Why the fuck if you had a doctor in history, would you be like, oh yeah, I got, oh, you mean like a,

06:26.160 --> 06:26.640
like a doctor.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.000
You thought that somebody was like, I need somebody to volunteer their immense knowledge

06:30.000 --> 06:31.200
of history at this.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.640
I'm just saying that they weren't specific.

06:32.640 --> 06:33.280
Nobody clarified.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.760
Nobody said, is there a medical doctor in the house?

06:35.760 --> 06:36.080
Sure.

06:36.640 --> 06:36.880
Sure.

06:37.520 --> 06:41.920
Well, at least if you're a doctor of history, after the person dies, you can tell everybody

06:41.920 --> 06:42.720
how it went down.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.280
Like you couldn't save him, but it was a beautiful eulogy.

06:47.200 --> 06:47.520
Oh yeah.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.240
Mark was a, Mark was a good man.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.080
He was a truck driver.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.680
Do you want to know about trucks?

06:54.240 --> 06:55.200
This is history.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.640
The truck was invented by Sterling.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.400
I'm a doctor of truckology.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.960
It was invented by Sterling Truckster.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.600
Trucks, trucks are big cars.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.760
A misconception held by many.

07:09.760 --> 07:16.400
A car is like a horse with wheels that a man put together.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.640
Can I be a doctor of patronizing?

07:21.200 --> 07:24.320
Can I be a doctor of condescending paternalism?

07:25.680 --> 07:27.600
I think, okay.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.800
My wife is a doctor.

07:29.600 --> 07:35.680
And when I sign us into guest books, I sign it as doctors, Justin and Sidney McElroy.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.920
Because that's, that's, that doesn't work.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.240
Now see, I'm just rounding up.

07:40.240 --> 07:43.680
The majority of us are doctors in our family.

07:44.720 --> 07:48.960
Now, now you know that it's not like you don't share like that, like a bank account.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.640
Like when you get married, you don't confer a title upon the other.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.640
Let me ask you, let me ask you this.

07:54.640 --> 07:59.200
When you, when you have a baby and you take, you take the child to the wedding,

07:59.200 --> 08:02.320
is the child temporarily a doctor for all intents and purposes?

08:02.320 --> 08:04.880
Oh, Griffin, we wouldn't take the child to the wedding.

08:04.880 --> 08:08.320
Okay. I mean, what if there's a ball pit?

08:08.320 --> 08:09.200
How long does this go?

08:09.200 --> 08:10.560
You, you have two cats now.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.800
Are they doctors as well?

08:12.800 --> 08:14.800
Uh, they're cats.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.920
So they, they work in a pharmacy.

08:17.920 --> 08:21.600
I always forget, I forget because cats are like just a perfect little ball of sunshine

08:21.600 --> 08:24.880
that they bring like the only happiness into my life that there is.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.000
Right.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.240
I forget, I forget they're people, I guess is what I mean.

08:28.240 --> 08:28.640
Oh yeah.

08:28.640 --> 08:33.840
I mean, cats are basically people that crawl around like the girl in the ring.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.280
But other than that, don't, don't ever.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.560
The grudge, the grudge.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.360
Sorry, not the ring.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.040
There's also a crawling girl.

08:41.040 --> 08:42.960
Is there a way to like correct?

08:42.960 --> 08:49.200
So just don't when someone's like, ah, Mr. McElroy, like to say, uh, it's Dr. McElroy.

08:49.200 --> 08:49.920
Nice to meet you.

08:50.640 --> 08:56.240
The only time that that ever happened to me was in college, which was always a crapshoot.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.920
Cause you don't know if your professor is a doctor or not,

08:59.920 --> 09:01.440
unless you're paying very close attention,

09:01.440 --> 09:03.760
which you probably aren't cause you're in college.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.880
You're too busy trying to, you know, chase skirts anyway.

09:11.360 --> 09:11.680
Yeah.

09:11.680 --> 09:16.240
So you'd be like, hello, professor Morgan.

09:16.240 --> 09:17.200
And it's a doctor.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.000
And then they'll correct you.

09:18.000 --> 09:18.960
And it's also a captain.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.680
I think that's the only, I think that's the only circumstance where it's appropriate.

09:23.680 --> 09:26.640
Otherwise just fucking let it fly or else things are going to get weird.

09:27.200 --> 09:27.440
Yeah.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.280
Just like drop doctor on them.

09:29.280 --> 09:32.320
Just no, just don't just leave the doctor out of it.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.600
Say my name is doctor.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.240
I'm the doctor.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.440
Do you think Superman walked around like, hello?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.840
So he's got some superpowers over here.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.040
So don't worry about those.

09:41.680 --> 09:42.320
What do you need?

09:42.320 --> 09:43.200
Something lifted later.

09:43.200 --> 09:43.680
Cause I can.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.240
Here's what you do.

09:46.240 --> 09:49.440
You go to him and say, hi, just, just simple.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.600
Just hi, my name's Dan.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.240
And they say, oh, that then they assume that must be your name.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.640
And then you say, actually it's Michael.

09:58.640 --> 10:02.720
I'm a doctor of mind freak of mind freak them.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.000
So just use a different first name.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.640
Now doctor of mind freak is that.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.040
Is that a four year program?

10:09.040 --> 10:10.880
What can you tell me about getting your doc?

10:10.880 --> 10:12.720
Cause I've been thinking about going back to school lately.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.760
I'm just having a hard time nailing down a concentration.

10:15.760 --> 10:20.320
It's actually pretty, if you go to ride aid or any other drug store and you see one of

10:20.320 --> 10:26.480
those like 120 magic tricks in a box, if you buy it and can master all of the tricks,

10:26.480 --> 10:30.640
then Chris angel comes to your house with Harry Blackwell, Blackstone.

10:30.640 --> 10:31.120
Fuck.

10:31.120 --> 10:31.600
I don't know.

10:31.600 --> 10:31.920
Damn it.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.800
You know, one of them street musicians, magicians.

10:35.840 --> 10:36.800
Oh my God.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.440
Keep it going.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.640
I need a doctor of strokes.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.920
Cause we're having a stroke.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.440
I need a doctor of that.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.600
It's like jazz, but jazz is being made by like a middle school jazz band.

10:47.600 --> 10:47.920
Right.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.560
It's like jazz that you squeeze fruits to get.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.440
Ah, that's juice.

10:51.440 --> 10:57.920
Man, I am just having a rough, rough day.

10:57.920 --> 11:01.120
It's like when you touch your, it's like when you touch your wormy and jazz comes out.

11:01.120 --> 11:01.520
No, wait.

11:01.520 --> 11:02.800
Ah, fuck, crap.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.640
It was a classy episode.

11:04.640 --> 11:05.440
That's sin.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.720
You're thinking of, you're thinking of sin.

11:06.720 --> 11:07.600
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

11:07.600 --> 11:08.000
Please.

11:08.000 --> 11:08.240
Yes.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.480
This is Jermaine.

11:10.480 --> 11:14.800
It was sent in by Teja or perhaps Teja or Tejay.

11:15.520 --> 11:16.080
Thank you.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Sammy, who asks,

11:18.320 --> 11:23.040
is it safe to use maple syrup as lube on my condom?

11:23.040 --> 11:30.000
Oh, well, I bought a bunch of condoms and it seems they aren't lubed at all.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.240
And really the only thing I can find around the house that could make a good lube is this syrup.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.040
Are there any harmful effects to this?

11:38.560 --> 11:39.440
Well, there's bears.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.840
There is bears.

11:41.840 --> 11:45.040
You do run the chance that it will harden.

11:45.040 --> 11:50.640
It will harden and then in a million years someone will be trying to make a sort of-

11:50.640 --> 11:52.000
John Hammond will make-

11:52.000 --> 11:55.360
John Hammond will make a park retreat for dumbasses.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.520
Come see the fucking dumbest people.

11:57.520 --> 12:03.920
They're like dumb, dumbass cavemen that got their wieners preserved in sweet, sweet amber.

12:05.520 --> 12:12.320
Let's address the fact that whenever you eat waffles or pancakes or anything syruped

12:12.320 --> 12:18.400
and you get that syrup on anything except for inside of your mouth,

12:19.440 --> 12:21.920
the syrup is all that you can smell for the rest of-

12:22.720 --> 12:24.720
until you just bleach the whole house.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.080
Do you guys remember waffle crisp?

12:27.360 --> 12:32.160
That shit was like changing your pheromones to waffles for eight days.

12:32.160 --> 12:36.000
It was like it had DNA strands in it that adhered to your own

12:36.000 --> 12:38.800
and made you produce syrup from all your glands.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.120
Well, the dinosaurs have gaps in their DNA.

12:41.120 --> 12:41.440
It's okay.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.040
We replace it with syrup.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.000
We put syrup DNA.

12:44.000 --> 12:44.720
Holy shit.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.320
The syrup can change genders.

12:46.320 --> 12:47.760
Syrup finds a way.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.120
Syrup finds a way, you guys.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.160
Yeah, that's gonna be a huge-

12:54.160 --> 12:56.240
Baby, it looks like tonight we're having a threesome.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.360
You, me, and Aunt Jemima.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.880
Okay.

12:58.880 --> 12:59.920
Now just picture it.

12:59.920 --> 13:00.880
Well, I can't.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.200
You burn my cortex.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.400
Here's the thing.

13:04.400 --> 13:04.960
Okay.

13:04.960 --> 13:09.040
When my- when my whole coffee table smells like syrup,

13:09.040 --> 13:10.880
it's upsetting because I don't want it to.

13:12.880 --> 13:16.560
But what if the- would that be so bad for a gin-gine?

13:17.280 --> 13:18.720
Here's another-

13:18.720 --> 13:19.520
Wait, for a what?

13:19.520 --> 13:22.560
Wait, for a what?

13:22.560 --> 13:25.040
For a gin-gine.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.040
A gin-gine?

13:27.040 --> 13:27.840
Okay.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.680
You make it sound like a Star Wars character.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.360
I'm gonna pretend that's German.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.360
I'm gonna pretend that's German.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.920
I'm gonna pretend that's German.

13:35.920 --> 13:36.880
It is.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.200
It's some slang you brought back with you.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.440
The three words that I knew were

13:41.440 --> 13:43.600
Guten Morgen, which was good morning

13:43.600 --> 13:46.000
because the hotel clerk told me to do it all the time.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Frühstück, which is breakfast,

13:48.000 --> 13:49.520
and also because we work with a guy

13:49.520 --> 13:50.880
whose last name is Frühstück.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.120
You're trying to convince us that every time

13:53.120 --> 13:56.800
you eat breakfast in Germany, he gets a cut off the top.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.440
And then also gin-gine, because I actually,

13:59.440 --> 14:01.440
I'm gonna be honest, I looked that one up.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.360
That one is-

14:03.360 --> 14:05.520
Did a little Google, or actually over there

14:05.520 --> 14:10.320
they call it something really funny.

14:10.880 --> 14:15.280
My main concern, aside from its lubic properties,

14:15.920 --> 14:19.120
my main concern is that it does not in any way

14:19.120 --> 14:22.240
impact the prophylactic qualities of this condom

14:22.240 --> 14:24.480
because from what I know of this individual,

14:24.480 --> 14:26.960
it is essential that he does not reproduce.

14:26.960 --> 14:32.320
It is more important to me than my next breath

14:32.320 --> 14:34.960
that there not be a junior ever attached

14:34.960 --> 14:36.080
to this gentleman's name.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.040
I cannot have him continue this lineage.

14:39.040 --> 14:44.160
Let's all address, the lube typically,

14:44.160 --> 14:45.520
not very viscous.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.320
Whenever you're trying to do some stuff down there,

14:48.320 --> 14:51.280
you don't usually go, yeah, I really wanna get it

14:51.280 --> 14:52.480
super sticky, like that.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.840
I just wanna gum it up.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.000
I wanna gum it up like Elmer's school glue.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.040
This is gonna feel great.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.840
It is going to, it will be a lot of tearing.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.840
The image I can't get out of my head is,

15:01.840 --> 15:03.280
after I eat pancakes or waffles,

15:03.280 --> 15:05.360
and I sit down for lunch or dinner,

15:05.360 --> 15:08.480
and there's a little bit of syrup on the table I missed,

15:08.480 --> 15:11.760
and it's the worst feeling ever to sit your arm down on it

15:11.760 --> 15:14.080
and be like, oh, oh, sticky here.

15:14.080 --> 15:14.880
Hey, Trav.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.640
And that's full body terrible.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.760
Trav, I like hyperbole as much as the next guy,

15:19.760 --> 15:23.840
but how is your reality that that is the worst thing ever?

15:23.840 --> 15:26.000
That is the worst.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.200
Have you, how many ever, like, do you know what ever is?

15:29.200 --> 15:30.560
Is this your first day ever?

15:30.560 --> 15:31.360
I do.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.640
Do you never sit there and go,

15:32.640 --> 15:34.080
where did this sticky come from?

15:34.080 --> 15:36.000
And for half a second, you can't remember?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.320
But the worst, Trav, it's the worst.

15:38.320 --> 15:39.680
Are you like Jack?

15:39.680 --> 15:42.160
Have you really only been alive for 16 days

15:42.160 --> 15:43.760
and you're just aging rapidly?

15:43.760 --> 15:45.200
No, Justin, I'm sorry.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.280
I have a low tolerance for horrible things.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.000
Apparently you've just been decent,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.400
you've been oversensitized to horrible things.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.280
I have been, Justin.

15:53.280 --> 15:56.080
If that rates up there, getting a sweet elbow,

15:56.080 --> 15:58.320
rates up there on like the worst things

15:58.320 --> 15:59.200
that have ever happened to you.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.080
A sweet elbow.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.720
That sounds like a sex thing.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.720
Yeah, they gave me a sticky bow.

16:07.280 --> 16:07.780
Yeah.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.520
Oh man, I hate this dumb show.

16:15.520 --> 16:19.040
I, man, don't do this.

16:19.040 --> 16:19.840
You listening?

16:19.840 --> 16:20.480
You out there?

16:21.040 --> 16:21.760
You tuned in?

16:21.760 --> 16:25.920
How about you say, baby, looks like we don't have any lube,

16:25.920 --> 16:27.280
but I made you some pancakes.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.680
You don't have to get your rocks off

16:31.680 --> 16:34.880
by ram jamming with some K-Row.

16:34.880 --> 16:38.800
Like if that's the option, I think you opt out.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.040
And I think you go the pancake route.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.600
I think you get some hungry Jack

16:43.600 --> 16:45.680
and you mix it with milk and eggs and oil

16:45.680 --> 16:47.360
and all of a sudden you have a breakfast time.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.040
Okay, listen, I don't wanna make too many presumptions,

16:51.040 --> 16:54.960
but is there, does the question indicate at all

16:54.960 --> 16:57.200
that there is a girl involved in this equation

16:57.200 --> 17:00.560
and or another person really for that matter?

17:02.240 --> 17:06.560
Well, there's condoms and I don't understand the science of,

17:06.560 --> 17:09.920
I don't understand what is the process there.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.400
Well, it lets you give yourself a familiar stranger.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.280
I mean, if you've got the condom on there,

17:15.280 --> 17:16.320
if that's your concern.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.520
And then if you put syrup in it,

17:19.520 --> 17:21.600
all of a sudden it's a sticky, whodunit.

17:21.600 --> 17:24.640
Now, Justin, what is a familiar stranger?

17:24.640 --> 17:27.440
Now, a familiar stranger, of course, is when you-

17:27.440 --> 17:28.800
Is when you stare across the room going,

17:28.800 --> 17:30.240
I swear, I know that guy.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.520
Yeah, that's exactly it.

17:31.520 --> 17:34.320
But in sex terms, it's when you put on a condom and masturbate

17:34.320 --> 17:37.040
because it's like, this feels so familiar.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.720
Where do we know you from?

17:41.440 --> 17:42.880
Where do I know this from?

17:42.880 --> 17:48.000
I can almost swear I know this exact jerk off,

17:48.000 --> 17:51.680
but I don't, oh, I cannot place it.

17:51.680 --> 17:52.800
Tip of my tongue.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.880
Is this a biz opportunity that we're just,

17:54.880 --> 17:57.840
is this a biz op that we're just watching fly right by?

17:57.840 --> 17:59.680
Is this a market that needs cornered?

18:00.480 --> 18:01.680
What market is that?

18:01.680 --> 18:09.360
Like Uncle Lumberjack's maple condoms, maple prophylactics.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.800
Uncle Lumberjack in it.

18:11.440 --> 18:16.080
I would say that if I'm all for the environment,

18:16.080 --> 18:18.720
and if we can make our products,

18:18.720 --> 18:22.560
which are served in like a plastic container,

18:22.560 --> 18:25.280
if we can make them do double duty,

18:25.280 --> 18:26.720
I mean, I guess what I'm saying is,

18:27.520 --> 18:29.840
currently maple syrup isn't formulated

18:29.840 --> 18:32.160
to be used as a sex lube.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.240
Yeah, well, we don't know that.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.360
Sorry, sorry, real quick.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.880
We don't know that for sure, but go on.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.080
But yeah, right.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.080
But I'm sure there could be a formulation

18:40.800 --> 18:42.240
to where you wouldn't need to have

18:42.240 --> 18:44.080
both of these products in your home.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.280
Yeah.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.000
You know, I mean, they could, chemically speaking,

18:48.000 --> 18:48.960
I don't think this is,

18:50.640 --> 18:52.960
I mean, you might not get as smooth of a pour

18:53.520 --> 18:58.320
over your hot cakes, over your Johnny cakes.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.240
It seems like once again,

19:00.240 --> 19:01.920
we've reached a point where we need to leave it

19:01.920 --> 19:03.360
in the hands of science.

19:03.360 --> 19:03.920
Yeah.

19:03.920 --> 19:04.800
How about it, science?

19:04.800 --> 19:06.960
But I wanna also leave it in the hands of industry,

19:06.960 --> 19:08.800
and I think we could be that industry

19:08.800 --> 19:11.200
if we somehow trademark these.

19:11.200 --> 19:14.320
I'm thinking SAP caps, I think is what we call them.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.520
Okay, SAP caps.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.000
You can go to ExtremeStraightStock, huh?

19:21.280 --> 19:23.120
Get yourself some SAP caps.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.160
Get on the ground floor.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.520
Yeah, invest in SAP caps now.

19:27.520 --> 19:29.200
It's a blue chip stock.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.280
It's a blue chip stock, by which I mean,

19:31.280 --> 19:32.640
it's an oo chip stock.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.880
It's a goo chip stock.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.800
And you can get this goo chip stock, right?

19:38.800 --> 19:39.840
Another for goo chip?

19:39.840 --> 19:40.640
Okay, because it-

19:40.640 --> 19:43.840
Don't put things on your penis that weren't designed.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.120
Here's a good rule of thumb.

19:45.120 --> 19:45.840
Look at the box.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.440
Does it say, this is for your penis?

19:47.440 --> 19:51.280
If no, turn to page 38, and then flip, flip, flip, flip.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.720
Don't put that on your cock.

19:52.720 --> 19:53.360
Stop it.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.040
Or your vagina, or your gin gin.

19:55.040 --> 19:55.440
No way.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.400
God damn.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.760
Or your gin gin bangs.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.400
I hate you guys.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.640
Hey, I'm currently shopping for a new car,

20:02.640 --> 20:04.160
and I'm hoping you can give me some,

20:04.160 --> 20:05.360
help me logic something out.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.560
I'm wondering if it's better to dress nicely,

20:08.560 --> 20:10.720
you know, tweed shirt and monocle,

20:10.720 --> 20:12.240
or dress like a hobo,

20:12.240 --> 20:14.240
preferably with bendel stick.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.400
Do you think it matters whether the dealer thinks

20:16.400 --> 20:19.040
I have money to burn, or I'm counting my pennies?

20:19.040 --> 20:20.240
Thanks, brothers.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.440
It's from Miss Peanut.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.280
Ooh, ooh.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.280
Gotta use my, use my noodle.

20:26.320 --> 20:30.240
I think the ideal situation, if I were to guess,

20:30.960 --> 20:35.360
would be, would be up and coming hobo.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.880
Like, hobo with possibilities, you know?

20:38.880 --> 20:42.400
See, I was thinking like, hobo, but with exemplary credit.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.600
Well, I want someone who says you're poor now,

20:46.480 --> 20:49.280
but you seem to be on an uptick.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.440
So next time you need a motor vehicle,

20:51.440 --> 20:54.240
you're gonna remember Sim Freis and Honda Nissan,

20:54.240 --> 20:56.720
and you're gonna come back through these doors,

20:56.720 --> 20:59.040
because I gave you a sick deal

20:59.040 --> 21:02.720
when you could barely scrape two wooden hobo nickels together.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.280
I like that.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.680
It's like the two baseball players that make it to first base

21:05.680 --> 21:06.240
at the same time.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.360
Which one do you take?

21:07.360 --> 21:09.360
You take the less experienced one,

21:09.360 --> 21:10.720
because you can train him up.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.840
You want to take this hobo as a potential car buyer,

21:13.840 --> 21:17.040
because yeah, he doesn't have the tweed skirt and monocle

21:17.040 --> 21:23.120
of Mrs. Employed, I guess would be the surname.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.040
But he's got heart.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.120
He's got spirit, you know?

21:27.120 --> 21:29.840
Doesn't have a cash flow to speak of,

21:29.840 --> 21:30.880
but there could be someday.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.000
He's got spunk.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.760
You want to get him behind the wheel

21:33.760 --> 21:37.200
of this new Honda Civic 2 Day.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.520
You want him to drive it off the lot,

21:39.520 --> 21:40.800
so when he comes back,

21:42.000 --> 21:43.680
you know, after he,

21:45.360 --> 21:48.000
much like the hobo in the hit film UHF

21:48.000 --> 21:49.600
that gets an exceptionally rare coin

21:50.160 --> 21:52.080
and then sells it for this neat watch,

21:56.320 --> 21:58.080
you could be that neat watch dealer.

21:58.080 --> 21:58.640
Thanks, mister.

21:58.640 --> 21:59.680
Thanks, mister.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.680
I got this neat watch.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.120
Hey, let's just spend the rest of the show

22:03.120 --> 22:05.360
doing impressions from UHF.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.400
Don't call me Mr. Butterfingers.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.520
Supplies.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.240
Red snapper, very tasty.

22:16.880 --> 22:20.160
Don't you know the do it decimal sees top?

22:20.160 --> 22:21.840
That's a best one.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.520
You should go in to look for a car

22:23.520 --> 22:26.880
just doing impressions from UHF.

22:26.880 --> 22:29.120
And now Michael Richards,

22:29.120 --> 22:31.920
the sweetly retarded janitor from UHF.

22:31.920 --> 22:32.960
Can we just do a quick,

22:32.960 --> 22:34.160
let me load up Wikipedia

22:34.160 --> 22:37.360
and read word for word the entire synopsis four times.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.240
Four times in a row?

22:38.240 --> 22:39.760
You think four times should be enough?

22:39.760 --> 22:41.600
Yeah, and then, no, no, no.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.040
Tell you what, read it four times

22:43.040 --> 22:44.400
and then when I'm editing,

22:44.400 --> 22:47.040
I'll just copy and paste until it's 16.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.120
I got you.

22:49.120 --> 22:49.920
I got you.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.760
So I think you got it.

22:51.760 --> 22:52.800
I think you can mix and match.

22:52.800 --> 22:53.840
I think you can put on,

22:53.840 --> 22:55.360
I think you can put on like a Tweety Bird,

22:55.920 --> 22:58.320
a Tweety Bird sweatshirt, maybe.

22:58.320 --> 22:59.600
And like a Tweed,

22:59.600 --> 23:01.760
like a Tweed skirt and Tweed shirt.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.600
Or a sensible skirt

23:03.600 --> 23:05.120
and a Tweety Bird sweatshirt.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.800
So you sit down at the desk and he's like,

23:06.800 --> 23:07.760
ah, you know,

23:07.760 --> 23:10.160
I'm not gonna drive too hard a deal here

23:10.160 --> 23:13.040
because you obviously are not a woman of means.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.560
And then you get that sweet deal

23:14.560 --> 23:16.240
and you stand up and he sees,

23:16.240 --> 23:16.800
what's that?

23:17.360 --> 23:20.000
Gucci pants.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.520
And then he knows,

23:21.520 --> 23:22.000
he knows you got it.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.600
A Gucci sweatshirt suit, damn.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.360
Yeah, he actually stands up

23:25.360 --> 23:28.080
and there's a Gucci tag on the Tweety Bird sweatshirt.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.040
And you're like, oh, you didn't know?

23:29.040 --> 23:30.720
This is from their Tweety line.

23:30.720 --> 23:31.920
Sylvester's on the back

23:31.920 --> 23:33.360
and he's wearing sunglasses.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.440
And he's got his arms crossed like Marky Mark.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.280
You can accomplish a lot of this

23:37.280 --> 23:38.800
when as you're buying the car,

23:38.800 --> 23:42.240
you say, well, as I'm picking out options here,

23:42.240 --> 23:44.160
can you show me the binder you have

23:45.360 --> 23:47.280
of Calvin peeing on different things

23:47.280 --> 23:49.360
that you can affix to the rear windshield?

23:49.360 --> 23:50.400
Because that should,

23:50.400 --> 23:52.240
I believe that comes standard

23:52.240 --> 23:53.760
on the vehicles you sell here.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.840
Ask when you take it out for a test drive,

23:55.840 --> 23:57.040
ask if you can put your,

23:59.040 --> 24:01.680
just horse and around bumper sticker on there

24:01.680 --> 24:02.720
as part of the test drive

24:02.720 --> 24:03.920
to really get the feel for it.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.680
I saw a car today with a bumper sticker

24:05.680 --> 24:07.520
and it was a paw print and it said,

24:07.520 --> 24:09.040
fur kids on board.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.280
So make sure you put that on there too.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.560
So he knows exactly.

24:12.560 --> 24:14.160
Now, is that saying that bumper sticker

24:14.160 --> 24:15.600
was for the kids who are on board

24:15.600 --> 24:17.440
or that there were four kids?

24:17.440 --> 24:19.680
No, fur, fur, F-U-R kids.

24:19.680 --> 24:20.880
They're fur kids.

24:20.880 --> 24:21.600
No, no, no, I heard-

24:21.600 --> 24:22.640
Like dog babies.

24:22.640 --> 24:23.600
Oh, fuck.

24:24.480 --> 24:25.760
These are my fur kids.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.520
That's awful.

24:27.520 --> 24:28.400
That presents a-

24:28.400 --> 24:30.080
These are my fur kids, they're on board.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.160
That presents a real temptation

24:32.160 --> 24:34.640
to just lean into the gas and hope for the best.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.200
Sorry about your fur kids.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.200
And also, I don't want to call this lady a liar.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.680
I looked in her car, I did not see any dogs.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.240
Okay.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.320
Right, it's just, it's their ghosts.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.040
Yeah, she just wanted to use the carpool lane, I guess.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.640
In much the same way that a baby on board sign

24:50.640 --> 24:51.920
does not keep me,

24:51.920 --> 24:55.120
is not the binding social contract

24:55.120 --> 24:57.280
that keeps me from colliding into people.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.480
I do think I would be so distracted

25:00.480 --> 25:02.320
and just sort of chagrined by someone

25:02.320 --> 25:04.800
who referred to animals as their fur kids

25:05.840 --> 25:08.000
that I might actually be tempted to take them out.

25:09.360 --> 25:12.080
If not take them out, at least cut them off.

25:12.080 --> 25:15.360
Is this a popular car buying strategy

25:15.360 --> 25:17.360
to be so insufferable

25:17.360 --> 25:20.400
that the salesman just doesn't want to be around you anymore?

25:20.400 --> 25:22.320
But he also wants to make the sale.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.760
So you could talk about your fur kids

25:23.760 --> 25:25.120
with your Tweety Bird sweatshirt.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.600
While you're explaining the plot of UHS.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.680
Uh-huh, do these three things.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.880
If you could smell a lot like syrup,

25:32.880 --> 25:35.280
like overwhelmingly,

25:35.280 --> 25:37.440
if you could even have maybe a little bit in your hair,

25:38.800 --> 25:41.840
then I think that this person would,

25:41.840 --> 25:43.120
you know, still want to get that sale,

25:43.120 --> 25:46.000
you know, still want to get that commish,

25:46.000 --> 25:48.160
but also just generally,

25:48.160 --> 25:50.080
like really not want to be in your presence.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.040
Here's some car buying strategy I learned.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.480
I found a car that I liked

25:56.480 --> 25:59.760
and, but I didn't buy it as soon as I found it.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.040
And the guy's like,

26:01.040 --> 26:02.640
I got some males coming to look at it.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.080
And I was like, oh man, I'm not falling for that one.

26:06.080 --> 26:08.160
You know, this isn't my first time with the Rodeo.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.080
And then the next day I came back

26:10.080 --> 26:11.200
and someone else bought it.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.560
So I just bought the next car he showed me

26:14.560 --> 26:16.800
because I didn't, I couldn't go through that again.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.240
It was out of his hands, you know?

26:20.880 --> 26:22.320
I just couldn't go through it.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.080
So that would be my advice is basically,

26:24.080 --> 26:26.160
don't fall in love

26:26.160 --> 26:28.240
because there's always going to be other cars

26:28.240 --> 26:30.400
and you may just be tired of looking at cars.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.680
I know, I got there.

26:31.680 --> 26:32.960
How about another Yahoo?

26:32.960 --> 26:34.320
Yeah, treat me to it.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.720
This one was sent in by Lisa Holyfield.

26:36.720 --> 26:37.680
Thank you, Lisa.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.240
It's by Yahoo Answers user Bryce, who asks,

26:42.160 --> 26:43.440
I want to start a gang.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.480
How is that done?

26:46.400 --> 26:47.920
The title pretty much says it all.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.320
Now this isn't any gangster with my pants

26:50.320 --> 26:51.920
around my knees kind of gang.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.320
I want this to be like a 1940s gang.

26:54.320 --> 26:57.920
It needs to have more class than quote busting caps.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.520
If you catch my drift.

26:59.520 --> 27:00.400
Oh my God.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.160
I'm a huge racist.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.880
Yeah, hey man, you already got a gang.

27:04.880 --> 27:06.240
They're called neo-Nazis.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.480
Just go fucking sign up.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.280
God damn it.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.760
I'm gonna be honest with you guys though.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.280
I would love to be in this gang.

27:15.280 --> 27:16.640
I'll judge.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.560
No, I know, I know, I know.

27:18.560 --> 27:21.680
Just to listen to this guy come up with plans for our gang.

27:21.680 --> 27:23.040
Our gang to get into.

27:23.040 --> 27:23.280
Yeah.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.440
What kind of shenanigans we're gonna get into.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.400
I haven't read all the laws that there are.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.920
Can you just walk down the street yelling,

27:31.920 --> 27:34.160
hey, who wants to start a gang with me?

27:34.160 --> 27:37.760
Who wants to be a part of the demon racers?

27:37.760 --> 27:41.440
Yeah, is that gonna be a legal problem?

27:41.440 --> 27:42.160
I've seen a lot.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.400
I mean, I've seen Johnny Dangerously a few times

27:44.400 --> 27:46.880
and I don't think any gang is gonna like the cut

27:46.880 --> 27:48.800
of my haircuts jib.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.720
I don't think my haircuts gonna cut the mustard.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.160
Are you fucking kidding me?

27:52.160 --> 27:55.280
Yeah, it's like too shaggy, I think.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.000
I think you've got a-

27:56.000 --> 27:57.680
I like it upstairs with like a real-

27:57.680 --> 28:01.360
You've got a real, I would say, a hard cut.

28:01.360 --> 28:02.640
No, I'm saying, I think that you,

28:02.640 --> 28:04.880
when you put some time and effort into it,

28:04.880 --> 28:07.280
which I'll be honest with you, Justin, is pretty rare.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.000
Yeah.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.400
I think you can have a pretty nice pompadour going for you.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.200
Oh yeah, definitely.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.360
Maybe, but I'd have to definitely get it trimmed.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.920
Maybe take some of the layers out so they're a little flatter.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.480
No, no, feather your bangs.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.240
It's beautiful when you feather them.

28:20.240 --> 28:20.800
Yeah, yeah.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.360
I'm gonna go to my guy, Sunny, and just see.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.040
I'm gonna give him Johnny Dangerously

28:25.040 --> 28:27.200
just a poster as a reference.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.240
Yeah, sure.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.040
And tell him not to do that cut,

28:31.040 --> 28:34.080
but to encompass the feeling of Johnny Dangerously

28:34.080 --> 28:35.120
in your haircut.

28:35.120 --> 28:37.040
Okay, but let me just, real quick,

28:37.040 --> 28:39.200
the issue for you joining, not joining this game,

28:39.200 --> 28:40.400
is your hair, right?

28:40.400 --> 28:42.880
And not your inability to shoot 30 cops

28:42.880 --> 28:43.920
outside of a train station.

28:45.040 --> 28:48.320
I could shoot, how fast are these cops running?

28:48.320 --> 28:52.560
It's not, okay, it's obviously a moral issue.

28:52.560 --> 28:55.920
Oh, because I played a lot of video games.

28:55.920 --> 28:59.760
So I mean, ideally I wouldn't have to kill any cops.

29:00.480 --> 29:04.000
But what do you think gangs do in the 1940s?

29:04.000 --> 29:04.720
They rob?

29:04.720 --> 29:05.840
Drag race?

29:05.840 --> 29:07.120
Drag race, that's one.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.720
Actually, nobody knows what happened in the 40s.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.000
There were wars.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.720
That's mainly what the gangs did is they fought our wars.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.960
But most of the records have been lost to time.

29:16.960 --> 29:21.360
Yeah, well, except for on their gangland tapestries.

29:22.320 --> 29:23.120
Yeah, right.

29:23.120 --> 29:26.160
I mean, there are the cave paintings, of course, but.

29:26.160 --> 29:29.440
Yeah, and their urns that they used to use

29:29.440 --> 29:32.640
to carry moonshine from county to county.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.400
I don't think that I would fit in well

29:36.400 --> 29:38.400
with any kind of gang, with the 1940s gang.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.240
Now, why is that just or any?

29:40.240 --> 29:41.520
There are several things.

29:42.080 --> 29:42.580
Okay.

29:42.580 --> 29:49.300
One of the big ones is that I like to sleep in.

29:49.300 --> 29:51.700
Have you thought about maybe just joining a badminton team?

29:53.060 --> 29:56.020
Wait, would the bad part be capitalized?

29:56.020 --> 29:58.580
Because that might be along the lines of where I'm going here.

29:59.860 --> 30:00.340
No, it would just be-

30:00.340 --> 30:02.260
Like a badminton team.

30:02.260 --> 30:04.820
Right, no, it would just be like a group of people

30:04.820 --> 30:07.860
who played badminton.

30:07.860 --> 30:10.420
Could I also suggest joining a glee club

30:10.420 --> 30:12.020
similar to the Wiffenpoofs?

30:12.020 --> 30:12.820
This would be good.

30:12.820 --> 30:13.380
Yeah, sure.

30:13.380 --> 30:14.660
Well, let me ask you guys.

30:14.660 --> 30:19.220
Well, okay, how many crime would we do?

30:19.860 --> 30:20.660
How many crime?

30:21.540 --> 30:22.420
You do crime.

30:23.700 --> 30:25.060
It depends on, I mean-

30:25.060 --> 30:28.340
If I showed up and we had played badminton

30:28.340 --> 30:31.700
or sung, you know, my old Kentucky home or something

30:31.700 --> 30:32.660
and we did it really well,

30:32.660 --> 30:34.020
and then afterwards I was like,

30:34.020 --> 30:36.660
guys, I'm ready to do a crime.

30:36.660 --> 30:39.700
Would they be like, would they know where to go to do one?

30:39.700 --> 30:40.500
Or would it just be like-

30:40.500 --> 30:42.420
I picture you guys walking around pushing over

30:42.420 --> 30:43.620
like newspaper stands.

30:44.180 --> 30:45.780
Oh, those things.

30:45.780 --> 30:50.340
Well, I do enough of that trying to practice my free running.

30:50.340 --> 30:52.660
So, I mean, I knock a lot of those over anyway.

30:52.660 --> 30:54.660
Are you still into percure?

30:54.660 --> 30:55.540
Yeah, I'm getting-

30:55.540 --> 30:57.300
You should join a parkour gang.

30:57.300 --> 30:59.220
Oh, a percure game would be great because I can-

30:59.220 --> 31:00.740
You just leave footprints everywhere.

31:01.700 --> 31:02.180
Well, that's bad for a crime.

31:02.180 --> 31:05.140
You kids, you kids did it again.

31:06.180 --> 31:07.940
I just painted that wall.

31:07.940 --> 31:10.420
Why'd you string on that wire I left lying around?

31:10.420 --> 31:13.940
How can we never see that in modern crime dramas?

31:13.940 --> 31:16.260
Like there's no episode of CSI where they follow

31:16.260 --> 31:19.940
like shaded in footprints, family circus style, you know?

31:19.940 --> 31:20.660
Yeah, right.

31:20.660 --> 31:22.820
Where they get a big magnifying glass

31:23.620 --> 31:26.100
and look at the black footprints that are-

31:26.100 --> 31:26.420
Sure.

31:26.980 --> 31:29.460
Oh man, what if Jeffy did commit a crime

31:29.460 --> 31:30.820
and they had to track him down on CSI?

31:30.820 --> 31:32.580
There were just red footprints everywhere.

31:32.580 --> 31:34.180
Hey, you're welcome, Mad TV.

31:35.620 --> 31:36.980
On a completely different note.

31:36.980 --> 31:37.620
Oh, good.

31:37.620 --> 31:38.820
But similar note.

31:38.820 --> 31:42.340
So the neighborhood that our company house

31:42.340 --> 31:43.700
where all of our young actors live,

31:44.260 --> 31:45.700
it's not a nice neighborhood.

31:46.420 --> 31:48.340
And the other day they were telling me that

31:48.340 --> 31:52.980
this group of young people was just throwing rocks at cars.

31:53.860 --> 31:56.260
Like on the street, not even cars driving by,

31:56.260 --> 31:59.460
just parked cars on the street, just throwing rocks at them.

31:59.460 --> 32:00.020
Can we-

32:00.020 --> 32:00.580
Why?

32:00.580 --> 32:03.060
Before we jump to any conclusions,

32:03.060 --> 32:05.540
are we sure that those cars didn't ask those children

32:05.540 --> 32:07.140
to throw rocks at them?

32:07.140 --> 32:09.300
Kind of Knight Rider situation.

32:09.300 --> 32:10.100
What?

32:10.100 --> 32:11.940
The Knight Rider where the cars are talking to them

32:11.940 --> 32:13.220
and asking them to throw rocks at them.

32:14.020 --> 32:14.980
You know Knight Rider.

32:14.980 --> 32:16.020
You know Knight Ritter.

32:16.020 --> 32:16.580
Knight Rider.

32:17.140 --> 32:17.940
With John Ritter.

32:20.340 --> 32:23.700
It's just John Ritter giving David Hasselhoff piggyback rides.

32:25.700 --> 32:26.740
Ritter Rider.

32:26.740 --> 32:28.660
You guys see that episode of Ritter Rider?

32:28.660 --> 32:28.900
Yeah.

32:28.900 --> 32:29.620
I love that one.

32:29.620 --> 32:30.260
Oh my God.

32:31.940 --> 32:35.940
Sorry, I just had the vision of John Ritter

32:35.940 --> 32:37.460
voiced by Mr. Feeney

32:37.460 --> 32:39.140
and I'm gonna have a rod all day now.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.180
Perfect.

32:42.180 --> 32:44.180
That's gonna really impede my workday.

32:44.180 --> 32:47.620
We don't need to join gangs if we want to make money

32:47.620 --> 32:50.260
because we have one dependable source of income

32:50.260 --> 32:52.100
and that is the money.

32:52.100 --> 33:07.060
I got a message for Clay from your brother Jack

33:07.060 --> 33:10.580
and Jack just wanted to stop by and say happy birthday.

33:10.580 --> 33:11.940
He was rolling by.

33:11.940 --> 33:13.860
He couldn't stick around until we started recording

33:13.860 --> 33:15.380
but he wanted us to tell you.

33:15.380 --> 33:16.420
He left this message.

33:16.420 --> 33:17.940
He left a note for us

33:17.940 --> 33:19.940
and he said he hoped that your sweet 16

33:19.940 --> 33:21.780
is the sweetest 16 ever

33:21.780 --> 33:23.380
and I have a feeling in my gut

33:23.380 --> 33:25.700
that it's gonna be pretty sweet.

33:27.060 --> 33:28.180
Happy birthday, Clay.

33:30.020 --> 33:33.140
I did not know that 16 and before this 15 year olds

33:33.140 --> 33:34.100
are listening to this show

33:34.100 --> 33:35.620
because we get pretty blue.

33:35.620 --> 33:36.180
It's a little blue.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.940
We just talked about bone in with syrup.

33:40.900 --> 33:45.220
I love course language and adult subject matter.

33:45.220 --> 33:46.420
Adult situations.

33:46.420 --> 33:51.300
What I don't want is for kids to listen to the things I say

33:51.300 --> 33:52.420
and then go to school

33:52.420 --> 33:55.060
and then tell their friends about adult situations

33:55.700 --> 33:56.980
and then they tell two friends

33:56.980 --> 33:58.420
and then they tell all their friends

33:58.420 --> 33:59.940
and then all of a sudden

33:59.940 --> 34:01.940
I'm basically a child pornographer.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.100
I don't know that you know what that means.

34:06.980 --> 34:08.660
Yeah, I saw little children.

34:09.220 --> 34:11.620
Sorry, can we go to the next thing?

34:11.620 --> 34:12.900
Yeah, I want to make a website

34:12.900 --> 34:14.580
about how much of a creep Griffin is.

34:14.580 --> 34:16.260
Does anybody know how to do that?

34:16.260 --> 34:18.660
You should check out the all new Squarespace Sigs.

34:18.660 --> 34:19.380

34:19.380 --> 34:23.460

34:23.460 --> 34:26.020

34:26.020 --> 34:27.860
I had an incredible responsive design

34:27.860 --> 34:29.780
and it's social media connectivity

34:29.780 --> 34:31.220
is just out of this world.

34:31.220 --> 34:32.100
Oh, really?

34:32.100 --> 34:32.980
Like on the moon?

34:35.460 --> 34:37.380
You can socially connect to people.

34:37.380 --> 34:39.940
I am Mars curiosity robot.

34:39.940 --> 34:42.420
Check out my social media connectivity.

34:43.060 --> 34:44.420
You know, he's tweeting.

34:44.420 --> 34:46.900
Yeah, he is tweeting and it's hilarious.

34:46.900 --> 34:47.380
He's good.

34:47.380 --> 34:48.180
He's doing good.

34:48.180 --> 34:50.260
So yeah, so if you're looking to make a website

is redoing his entire website with Squarespace Sigs

35:10.420 --> 35:11.940
and doing a video series about it.

35:11.940 --> 35:12.660
Oh, cool.

35:12.660 --> 35:14.420
It's got legit tech.

35:14.420 --> 35:16.820
It's legit, my brother, my brother and me.

35:16.820 --> 35:19.460
The all new Squarespace six has got legit tech,

35:19.460 --> 35:20.420
by his quote.

35:20.420 --> 35:23.220
Friends, do you have a video game website,

35:23.220 --> 35:26.420
podcast or app that needs some affordable original music?

35:26.420 --> 35:28.100
We got the guy for you.

35:28.100 --> 35:32.100
Jake Hawken, H-A-W-K-E-N.

35:32.100 --> 35:34.580
He's at jakehawken.com.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.340
He does outro music for your podcast.

35:38.340 --> 35:41.220
He'll do theme music and carry it around in a boom box.

35:41.700 --> 35:43.860
He'll do sound effects for your website,

35:43.860 --> 35:45.460
graphic novel or app.

35:45.460 --> 35:48.740
Don't buy that stupid ass catalog music.

35:48.740 --> 35:51.220
Don't buy that beat ass catalog music.

35:51.220 --> 35:54.580
When I hear the same music on Project Runway

35:54.580 --> 35:57.140
and then later on America's Next Top Model,

35:57.140 --> 35:58.340
here's what I always say,

35:58.340 --> 35:59.860
and you'll find this on his website.

35:59.860 --> 36:03.140
I say, fuck, should have called Jake Hawken.

36:03.700 --> 36:04.580
That's my thing.

36:04.580 --> 36:05.300
That's what I say.

36:05.300 --> 36:07.940
Fuck, should have called Jake Hawken.

36:07.940 --> 36:08.440
Yeah.

36:09.460 --> 36:10.340
So, uh.

36:10.340 --> 36:11.780
Hey, just real quick, one more time.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.980
Fuck, should have called Jake Hawken.

36:14.980 --> 36:16.420
Should have called Jake Hawken.

36:16.420 --> 36:16.980
Yeah.

36:16.980 --> 36:18.340
And you can get that as a sound effect

36:18.340 --> 36:19.780
that his website's available there

36:19.780 --> 36:24.260
at jakehawken, H-A-W-K-E-N.com.

36:24.260 --> 36:27.140
And the last thing we need to mention,

36:27.140 --> 36:30.180
and gosh, guys, if you are not having a good week,

36:30.180 --> 36:33.220
you should know how many weeks of advertising

36:33.220 --> 36:35.300
our friends at Extreme Restraints bought with us

36:35.300 --> 36:39.060
because it is going to get so real

36:39.060 --> 36:40.820
over the next few months.

36:40.820 --> 36:41.460
It is going to get-

36:41.460 --> 36:42.660
Buckle up.

36:42.660 --> 36:43.300
Buckle up.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.860
And by which I mean to the bed with your lover.

36:45.860 --> 36:46.100
Right.

36:46.100 --> 36:47.540
You can provide that for you now.

36:47.540 --> 36:50.580
I have suggested that we retitle the podcast

36:50.580 --> 36:53.940
The McElroy Brothers Extreme Restraints Comedy Hour.

36:53.940 --> 36:55.380
Buckle up and fuckle up

36:55.380 --> 36:57.220
because it's Extreme Restraints time.

36:59.540 --> 37:03.940
If you need some sex toys, and I mean sex toys,

37:04.900 --> 37:05.940
this stuff gets real.

37:05.940 --> 37:07.140
We have a coupon code.

37:07.140 --> 37:08.500
It's MIDLIST.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.220
And if you use the coupon code extremerestraints.com,

37:11.220 --> 37:14.260
then you are going to get 20% off

37:14.260 --> 37:17.300
on any week that you hear this advertisement.

37:17.940 --> 37:20.580
So that's the first thing that we want to get across to you.

37:20.580 --> 37:22.740
Here are some things that listeners have bought

37:22.740 --> 37:24.180
using this extreme code.

37:25.140 --> 37:26.180
Anal trainer set.

37:27.140 --> 37:27.940
Astro-glide.

37:27.940 --> 37:29.620
Now, we're going to have to stop

37:29.620 --> 37:30.980
and go bullet point by bullet point here

37:30.980 --> 37:34.020
because in what way does my anus

37:34.020 --> 37:36.100
does pretty much everything I need it to do right now,

37:36.100 --> 37:37.780
and it does it pretty good, I think.

37:37.780 --> 37:39.060
Nope, that's incorrect.

37:39.060 --> 37:42.420
Your anus is an untapped well of pleasure.

37:42.420 --> 37:43.140
Oh, okay.

37:44.420 --> 37:47.780
It's an untapped pleasure well.

37:48.420 --> 37:50.020
Some other things our listeners have bought.

37:50.020 --> 37:51.460
A swirl bloom vibrator.

37:51.460 --> 37:53.300
Wall beggar vibrating dildo.

37:53.300 --> 37:54.500
Five inch slim vibe.

37:54.500 --> 37:55.460
Astro-glide.

37:55.460 --> 37:57.380
A cute harness dildo.

37:57.380 --> 37:58.020
Butterfly.

37:58.020 --> 38:01.220
Now, is that a cute harness dildo?

38:01.220 --> 38:04.180
Yes, it is an adorable harness dildo.

38:04.820 --> 38:05.620
But anyway.

38:05.620 --> 38:07.780
Do you think a swirl bloom vibrator

38:07.780 --> 38:09.860
is what Willy Wonka uses to masturbate?

38:11.460 --> 38:13.460
Hand me the schnauzberry flavored lube.

38:13.460 --> 38:14.180
Ew, no!

38:15.540 --> 38:16.740
I also want to point this out

38:16.740 --> 38:18.500
because I was going through their website,

38:18.500 --> 38:19.380
as I often do.

38:20.420 --> 38:22.900
I love that under categories,

38:22.900 --> 38:24.580
there's a dildo category

38:24.580 --> 38:27.220
and then a separate huge dildo category.

38:28.820 --> 38:29.540
Don't get it twisted.

38:29.540 --> 38:30.660
If you're in the dildo category,

38:30.660 --> 38:31.300
like these look,

38:32.020 --> 38:34.580
these are way too small for my gaper.

38:34.580 --> 38:37.060
Then you can, oh man!

38:37.060 --> 38:38.420
Let me upgrade you.

38:38.420 --> 38:40.900
You can, there was a website designer

38:40.900 --> 38:42.660
who was browsing the dildos one day

38:42.660 --> 38:45.540
and said, and someone came in and he said,

38:45.540 --> 38:48.340
Darla, did you see this new dildo we just got in?

38:48.340 --> 38:50.420
And she said, no, Philip, I didn't see it.

38:50.420 --> 38:51.300
He said, look at this.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.300
I don't even think you can legally classify

38:53.300 --> 38:54.260
this as a dildo.

38:54.820 --> 38:56.500
It needs its own taxonomy.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.780
It needs its own taxonomy in our architecture

38:59.780 --> 39:02.340
because it is so huge.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.620
I don't want anyone to buy it

39:03.620 --> 39:05.620
expecting a standard dildo.

39:05.620 --> 39:10.340
What have I done?

39:10.340 --> 39:11.940
I have to put this in me now.

39:13.540 --> 39:14.980
I'm looking for branding opportunities

39:14.980 --> 39:15.700
just all the time.

39:15.700 --> 39:18.340
And I think what if big dildos,

39:18.340 --> 39:19.700
what if they're called thrill-dos?

39:22.180 --> 39:24.260
Oh no, oh no.

39:24.260 --> 39:25.220
You put them in the freezer.

39:25.220 --> 39:26.420
It's a chill-do.

39:26.420 --> 39:27.620
Oh no.

39:27.620 --> 39:30.500
So go to extremistrace.com

39:30.500 --> 39:32.100
and use the coupon code MIDDLIST

39:32.100 --> 39:33.380
to get 20% off.

39:33.380 --> 39:34.100
Go now.

39:34.100 --> 39:36.100
I think a dildo would not feel very good.

39:37.380 --> 39:38.340
Not at first.

39:38.340 --> 39:39.300
No, not at first.

39:39.300 --> 39:41.460
Cover it in hot Cairo though.

39:41.460 --> 39:42.820
And you are in business,

39:42.820 --> 39:43.860
the business of sadness.

39:44.740 --> 39:46.260
Yeah, a couple weeks ago,

39:46.260 --> 39:47.860
I started hanging out with a lady.

39:48.420 --> 39:49.380
She was really cool

39:49.380 --> 39:50.580
and she seemed to like me as well.

39:50.580 --> 39:51.220
A few days later,

39:51.220 --> 39:53.220
she sent me a message to let me know

39:53.220 --> 39:55.460
that she only wanted to be friends.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.420
I was a little sad.

39:56.420 --> 39:58.580
I got over it until I learned why

39:59.300 --> 40:00.660
she was dating a magician,

40:00.660 --> 40:03.300
an actual magician,

40:03.780 --> 40:05.700
a man whose job it is

40:05.700 --> 40:08.020
to perform magic tricks.

40:08.500 --> 40:11.300
I was passed over for a magician.

40:12.340 --> 40:14.340
How should I feel about this?

40:14.340 --> 40:16.020
Should I feel offended

40:16.020 --> 40:17.540
or have I dodged a bullet

40:17.540 --> 40:20.180
that's from beaten in Brisbane?

40:23.620 --> 40:25.380
I mean, I think,

40:25.380 --> 40:27.060
I think, you know what?

40:27.060 --> 40:29.860
You know what? Go to the fridge.

40:30.740 --> 40:32.020
Let's go crack a cold one.

40:34.020 --> 40:34.660
Yeah.

40:34.660 --> 40:35.300
Classic tale.

40:35.300 --> 40:35.780
Listen, man.

40:35.780 --> 40:37.140
Boy meets girl.

40:37.140 --> 40:38.340
Girl loves magician.

40:38.340 --> 40:40.020
Not gonna lie to you, man.

40:40.020 --> 40:40.900
That's a bad beat.

40:42.340 --> 40:42.820
You know what?

40:43.380 --> 40:44.020
Brother, you just,

40:45.700 --> 40:46.660
ta-da.

40:46.660 --> 40:47.380
You fucked up.

40:47.940 --> 40:48.440
Yep.

40:49.060 --> 40:50.660
Magically, she made yourself

40:50.660 --> 40:51.700
confidence disappear.

40:51.700 --> 40:52.200
Poof.

40:52.740 --> 40:54.340
David Copperfield's greatest tricks.

40:54.340 --> 40:56.500
Hey, you shouldn't feel that bad though

40:56.500 --> 40:58.660
because some, some illusionists,

40:58.660 --> 40:59.700
as they prefer,

40:59.700 --> 41:00.900
are really dope.

41:01.620 --> 41:05.060
Like, one time David Copperfield got mugged.

41:05.060 --> 41:06.580
Do you guys, have you guys heard this story?

41:06.580 --> 41:07.080
Yeah.

41:07.080 --> 41:07.780
No, is this true?

41:07.780 --> 41:08.900
This is 100% true.

41:10.100 --> 41:12.100
One time David Copperfield got mugged

41:12.100 --> 41:13.460
with two assistants, right?

41:14.180 --> 41:18.020
And when he went to go empty out his pockets

41:18.740 --> 41:23.380
and he palmed his cell phone

41:23.380 --> 41:25.300
and his wallet and his passport,

41:25.300 --> 41:30.100
he palmed them and it revealed empty pockets.

41:30.100 --> 41:33.780
He palmed them so the mugger would think

41:33.780 --> 41:34.820
he didn't have anything.

41:34.820 --> 41:38.980
And okay, so this, and, and then like,

41:38.980 --> 41:41.540
obviously the mugger was arrested and so.

41:42.660 --> 41:45.540
But then he escaped and appeared on the balcony.

41:45.540 --> 41:46.040
Right.

41:46.740 --> 41:48.980
So here's some interesting things about this story.

41:48.980 --> 41:52.420
One, he let his assistant go.

41:52.420 --> 41:55.220
He let his assistants be robbed.

41:55.220 --> 41:56.660
He didn't use, he didn't,

41:56.660 --> 41:58.340
he didn't have a trick to get out of that.

41:58.340 --> 42:00.180
So that's, that's problem one.

42:00.180 --> 42:02.660
He didn't apparate a gun or a taser.

42:02.660 --> 42:03.540
Right, exactly.

42:03.540 --> 42:05.540
A dove, maybe, just as a distraction.

42:06.180 --> 42:07.860
The other problem with this is that

42:08.420 --> 42:11.540
David Copperfield is apparently

42:11.540 --> 42:13.780
in such financial dire straits

42:13.780 --> 42:16.500
that he'll risk taking a bullet to the chest

42:16.500 --> 42:18.980
just to preserve the like 30 dollars

42:18.980 --> 42:22.020
and pita pit coupon he has in his wallet.

42:22.020 --> 42:23.620
First off, what if he had nine stamps

42:23.620 --> 42:25.540
on that coupon and was one away?

42:25.540 --> 42:26.500
Yeah, that's true.

42:26.500 --> 42:27.300
That's true.

42:27.300 --> 42:31.460
Second off, those, those abilities

42:31.460 --> 42:33.700
are rarely, if ever, practical.

42:33.700 --> 42:34.100
So I think he just.

42:34.100 --> 42:34.980
Don't you think at this point,

42:34.980 --> 42:37.060
like there's no challenge anymore?

42:37.060 --> 42:39.060
And he's like, this is, this is my time.

42:39.060 --> 42:41.060
Right, I have to push this to the next level.

42:41.060 --> 42:42.420
I have to go real magic.

42:42.420 --> 42:45.140
Also, if you're a robber and you're robbing someone

42:45.140 --> 42:46.420
and they do magic to you,

42:47.060 --> 42:48.420
I don't think you shoot them.

42:48.420 --> 42:50.580
I think, I think you maybe let them go scot free

42:50.580 --> 42:52.740
and say, that was the most creative being robbed

42:52.740 --> 42:53.620
I've ever seen.

42:54.340 --> 42:55.300
You are free to go.

42:55.300 --> 42:57.300
Another fine performance, Mr. Copperfield.

42:57.300 --> 42:59.300
The moral of the story is magicians are awesome.

42:59.860 --> 43:01.060
Some magicians are awesome.

43:01.940 --> 43:04.260
What if this girl is like dating Lance Burton,

43:04.260 --> 43:05.460
the coolest magician?

43:05.460 --> 43:06.660
That is, that is an issue.

43:07.940 --> 43:09.140
Then, then you can't feel bad.

43:09.140 --> 43:10.420
But if it's like David Blaine,

43:10.980 --> 43:13.300
then yeah, you should probably feel bad about it.

43:13.300 --> 43:13.540
Yeah.

43:14.100 --> 43:16.820
If it's Chris Angel, well, yeah, he's awesome.

43:16.820 --> 43:17.220
I don't know.

43:17.220 --> 43:19.940
David Blaine can hold his breath for a really long time.

43:19.940 --> 43:21.460
No, David Blaine can hold his breath

43:21.460 --> 43:22.900
so he can't smell his own farts.

43:22.900 --> 43:23.620
I hate that guy.

43:26.260 --> 43:26.500
What?

43:26.500 --> 43:27.860
Was that an insult?

43:27.860 --> 43:28.820
I'm not sure.

43:28.820 --> 43:29.700
I just hate himself.

43:32.420 --> 43:33.460
Ah, man.

43:33.460 --> 43:34.980
When Travis hates somebody enough,

43:34.980 --> 43:37.140
he just references their flatness.

43:37.140 --> 43:39.220
And then that's, that's enough to really put him in that place.

43:39.220 --> 43:41.700
Don't let Leo DiCaprio hear you talking that way.

43:41.700 --> 43:44.260
Cause he, he, he won't let you live it down.

43:44.260 --> 43:45.140
He loves DB.

43:46.260 --> 43:46.500
What?

43:47.220 --> 43:47.620
Oh yeah.

43:47.620 --> 43:51.300
The first, the first in his first hit special, Street Magic,

43:51.860 --> 43:53.700
it was hosted by Leo DiCaprio.

43:54.900 --> 43:56.500
No way.

43:56.500 --> 43:56.980
Yeah, way.

43:56.980 --> 43:58.820
That was like prime Leo years.

43:58.820 --> 43:59.060
Yeah.

43:59.060 --> 44:02.180
That's why, that's why Kate pushed him off the door at the end of Titanic.

44:02.900 --> 44:04.580
Let me tell you again about David Blaine.

44:04.580 --> 44:06.580
No, no, I get it.

44:06.580 --> 44:08.580
He made a card appear on a window.

44:09.220 --> 44:10.900
No matter who you get dumped for,

44:11.540 --> 44:13.540
there are always going to be things about them

44:13.540 --> 44:16.260
that make it slightly ridiculous because they're not you.

44:16.260 --> 44:17.620
Yeah, from your perspective,

44:18.180 --> 44:20.820
nobody's ever said like, yeah, she left me for this guy,

44:20.820 --> 44:23.460
but he's really good at soccer.

44:23.460 --> 44:24.020
Yeah, right.

44:24.020 --> 44:28.020
But to be fair, he's a way better person than me in just about every way.

44:28.660 --> 44:31.460
In college, I had a girlfriend who left me for a hot air balloon.

44:38.740 --> 44:40.820
I wish that was the true story.

44:40.820 --> 44:43.460
I mean, she, she didn't like date the hot air balloon,

44:43.460 --> 44:45.860
but she did set off on a world adventure for the hot,

44:45.860 --> 44:48.980
and she said, we can't, when I'm up in the clouds, you know.

44:48.980 --> 44:50.900
You're just gonna, you're just gonna hold me down.

44:50.900 --> 44:51.300
Yeah, yeah.

44:51.300 --> 44:53.460
I gotta cut that sandbag loose.

44:55.220 --> 44:56.740
It is a different world up there though.

44:56.740 --> 44:57.860
I mean, to be fair.

44:57.860 --> 44:59.060
Once you get in the stratosphere.

44:59.060 --> 45:00.340
It's a whole new world.

45:00.340 --> 45:03.060
Once you get in the stratosphere, then you just, you die probably

45:03.060 --> 45:05.620
because hot air balloons don't provide you with any protection.

45:05.620 --> 45:08.100
There's zero, there's absolutely no protection within the elements.

45:08.660 --> 45:11.380
Hey, NBNBAM, that's us.

45:11.940 --> 45:13.380
I want to ask my girlfriend to marry me.

45:13.380 --> 45:18.020
I know the how part already, but I'm torn on the when, the when.

45:18.020 --> 45:18.500
Wow.

45:19.220 --> 45:22.660
I had been planning on a day that's special to us,

45:22.660 --> 45:25.300
but I think she suspects that when I would ask her.

45:26.020 --> 45:29.860
So my question is, do I go with the element of surprise

45:30.580 --> 45:33.140
or the something expected yet meaningful?

45:33.140 --> 45:35.460
And that's suitor from the south.

45:36.260 --> 45:38.260
I have some insight into this question.

45:39.700 --> 45:40.660
Would you like to hear it?

45:40.660 --> 45:41.220
Yeah.

45:41.220 --> 45:43.140
I think I know what it is, but you don't.

45:43.140 --> 45:47.140
But yes, my wife thought that she,

45:47.140 --> 45:51.380
that I was going to propose to her on Christmas and I didn't.

45:51.940 --> 45:53.620
I proposed to her on New Year's Eve.

45:54.660 --> 45:57.220
So she was fine in the end.

45:57.940 --> 45:59.860
But there was a six day gap there.

45:59.860 --> 46:04.580
But there was a six day gap where things could have been better.

46:07.220 --> 46:09.060
She could have been in a better mood.

46:09.780 --> 46:12.500
Now let me, let me give the counterpoint.

46:12.500 --> 46:13.140
Oh, great.

46:13.700 --> 46:17.620
My girlfriend and I like knew what exactly,

46:17.620 --> 46:20.100
almost what time her ring was going to be available.

46:20.100 --> 46:22.180
She knew it was happening and said to me,

46:22.180 --> 46:24.740
if you wait, I will kill you.

46:24.740 --> 46:25.140
Okay.

46:25.140 --> 46:25.380
Right.

46:25.380 --> 46:28.100
So I like proposed as soon as I got home, which was fine.

46:28.100 --> 46:29.060
It was very nice for us.

46:29.060 --> 46:31.300
Got down to one knee, did the sets of romantic things,

46:31.300 --> 46:32.820
butter flowers, very nice.

46:32.820 --> 46:37.060
And then I had to spend the rest of time explaining to people

46:37.060 --> 46:39.380
why I didn't do something more surprising.

46:39.380 --> 46:40.020
Sure.

46:40.020 --> 46:41.540
Now here's the counter counterpoint.

46:41.540 --> 46:44.020
Um, who wants to get married?

46:44.020 --> 46:45.940
Bond, chain, milk, milk, milk.

46:45.940 --> 46:47.060
Don't milk the cow.

46:47.620 --> 46:49.060
You can go out and get it.

46:49.060 --> 46:52.740
You don't have to tie yourself down with a, don't just fry

46:52.740 --> 46:54.020
for you on that hot air balloon.

46:54.020 --> 46:56.180
Cause you don't need a sandbag tying you down.

46:56.740 --> 46:57.140
Let's go.

46:57.140 --> 46:57.860
See, just go.

46:57.860 --> 47:00.660
So your seeds in the field of pussies.

47:00.660 --> 47:01.460
I don't remember that.

47:01.460 --> 47:03.300
Wait a minute.

47:03.300 --> 47:04.420
Stop the world.

47:04.420 --> 47:05.860
I want to get off.

47:05.860 --> 47:07.460
What did you just say?

47:07.460 --> 47:09.620
So your seed in a field of pussies.

47:09.620 --> 47:13.140
What kind of ship are you running here?

47:13.140 --> 47:15.220
So your wild oats in the pussy dirt.

47:15.220 --> 47:16.100
It's not a ship.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.700
It's a farm, obviously.

47:17.700 --> 47:18.420
Pussy farm.

47:18.420 --> 47:19.940
Zynga's new Facebook hit.

47:21.700 --> 47:25.780
Come water my pussy so I can get 30 pussy coins.

47:29.140 --> 47:30.500
Have you seen my pussy cow?

47:30.500 --> 47:32.660
I think it wandered onto your Facebook farm.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.060
Give us $30.

47:37.060 --> 47:39.460
We'll give you 600 John John points.

47:39.460 --> 47:42.100
And you can use to buy new pussy cows.

47:42.100 --> 47:44.420
Oh, the pussy wolf came and snuck into your farm.

47:44.420 --> 47:45.780
Made all your rutabagas.

47:45.780 --> 47:46.900
You pussy bagas.

47:49.140 --> 47:50.740
Our wolves are vegetarian.

47:52.900 --> 47:54.580
Don't steal that in your Facebook game.

47:54.580 --> 47:55.860
We'll sue you.

47:55.860 --> 47:57.460
Come on down to John John ranch.

47:58.580 --> 48:02.740
For all the, we got milk for the pussy cows.

48:02.740 --> 48:03.940
Ready to move on.

48:03.940 --> 48:09.060
There was a lot of, I guess it's good that we do a split.

48:09.060 --> 48:11.700
Every now and then, because we usually talk about boners a lot,

48:11.700 --> 48:14.260
but there was a lot of discussion of the vagina

48:14.260 --> 48:17.300
and its parts in this particular episode.

48:17.300 --> 48:18.420
Watch out throwing shit.

48:19.620 --> 48:20.580
We've got your number.

48:21.860 --> 48:23.220
We know how to talk to the ladies.

48:23.940 --> 48:24.820
Oh yeah.

48:24.820 --> 48:27.700
There's nothing ladies like more than hearing about their bits.

48:27.700 --> 48:30.340
Listen, we were very clinical about it.

48:32.580 --> 48:33.780
That is all official terminology.

48:33.780 --> 48:35.860
We are nothing if not respectful.

48:35.860 --> 48:36.500
Right.

48:36.500 --> 48:37.380
That is all official terminology.

48:37.380 --> 48:40.020
We weren't making fun of stupid vaginas.

48:40.020 --> 48:42.100
You go in instead of out, dumb.

48:42.100 --> 48:45.300
What's your deal, you hidey bastards?

48:45.300 --> 48:45.800
Yeah.

48:46.980 --> 48:48.820
Why are you so ashamed of what's going on in there?

48:50.820 --> 48:51.940
I don't know who this character is,

48:51.940 --> 48:53.620
but I want to fucking kill him.

48:55.940 --> 48:58.980
I want to stick some sort of hot iron inside of my brain

48:58.980 --> 49:01.380
and burn out whatever part of it that voice comes from.

49:01.380 --> 49:07.860
So this is the part where we plug our social on NBNBAM's Twitter.

49:09.140 --> 49:11.940
You can find us on Facebook if you want to join that group.

49:11.940 --> 49:13.300
That's a robust group.

49:13.300 --> 49:13.800
Yeah.

49:13.800 --> 49:17.380
If you want to help water our pussy plants on Sunshine Ranch,

49:17.380 --> 49:20.420
you can go to Facebook.com slash bambambam.

49:20.420 --> 49:20.920
Yeah.

49:20.920 --> 49:22.820
People like to make fan art sometimes,

49:22.820 --> 49:25.620
but don't do it for any of the things we said this time.

49:25.620 --> 49:28.500
Hey, all the things that we said today, off limits.

49:28.500 --> 49:31.620
This episode is non-canonical.

49:31.620 --> 49:35.700
This is outside of the NBNBAM-verse.

49:35.700 --> 49:37.140
This is our lost episode.

49:38.260 --> 49:40.100
You only wished we lost it.

49:40.100 --> 49:43.380
Generations from now, people will ask if this episode ever really existed.

49:44.980 --> 49:50.180
Thank you for people tweeting about the show with the NBNBAM hashtag,

49:50.180 --> 49:56.580
including Laura Nesson, Chase Router, Adams Router,

49:56.580 --> 50:01.940
Adams Holds, Wiggy1978, The Unchosen One,

50:02.660 --> 50:06.260
Waylon Baw, Hello Joe Ben, DuckLips513 as always,

50:06.900 --> 50:08.660
Jonathan Byathan, anybody else?

50:08.660 --> 50:12.020
I'm forgetting about Chorus, BuzzClick, Hallways,

50:13.060 --> 50:14.900
Fanta Creek Music.

50:15.700 --> 50:16.500
That's every name.

50:17.380 --> 50:18.580
That's all the Twitters.

50:18.580 --> 50:24.340
Please go subscribe to our show, review our show, rate it, all that good stuff.

50:24.340 --> 50:27.620
And Justin, don't we have a new way of contacting us, do we not?

50:27.620 --> 50:28.660
We do.

50:28.660 --> 50:35.460
We actually now have a My Brother, My Brother, Me mailing address.

50:36.740 --> 50:46.580
You just send stuff to NBNBAM and it is PO Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

50:46.580 --> 50:49.140
So if you want to mail us pretty much anything.

50:49.140 --> 50:50.900
Not poison.

50:50.900 --> 50:52.260
Not poison.

50:52.260 --> 50:53.700
I can't stress enough.

50:53.700 --> 50:55.220
Please don't kill us.

50:55.220 --> 50:55.460
Yeah.

50:56.100 --> 51:00.740
Now I will also say that if you mail us baked goods, we probably won't eat them.

51:00.740 --> 51:05.300
But I just say that and if somebody actually does send them, probably will eat them.

51:05.300 --> 51:08.580
Because they're just make the baked goods and then take a picture of it

51:08.580 --> 51:09.540
and then mail that to us.

51:09.540 --> 51:12.500
And a video of you eating the first one of the batch.

51:12.500 --> 51:13.060
Right.

51:13.060 --> 51:13.860
That's what we need.

51:13.860 --> 51:16.580
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

51:16.580 --> 51:18.900
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

51:18.900 --> 51:19.620
For sure.

51:19.620 --> 51:20.260
Can I do that?

51:21.220 --> 51:21.940
Go ahead.

51:21.940 --> 51:22.660
Okay, thanks.

51:22.660 --> 51:25.540
Oh, we haven't talked about this in a long, long time.

51:25.540 --> 51:29.780
But if you would like some My Brother, My Brother and Me gear.

51:29.780 --> 51:35.940
We have a MBNBAM, I call it, I think of it as the detective shirt.

51:35.940 --> 51:38.260
But I don't know what most people think of that.

51:38.260 --> 51:39.860
The adventure shirt.

51:39.860 --> 51:40.580
Adventure shirt.

51:41.460 --> 51:46.900
And then we have a shirt for people who's nasty gum, which is an old favorite.

51:46.900 --> 51:49.300
So that's at maxfunstore.com.

51:49.300 --> 51:50.180
You just buy those.

51:50.180 --> 51:51.300
They'll just sell them to you.

51:51.300 --> 51:55.700
And we also haven't mentioned in a while about tweeting quotes you like from the show.

51:55.700 --> 51:58.180
It's always great to see people who have just started listening

51:58.180 --> 52:00.020
and gone back through the back catalog.

52:00.020 --> 52:02.660
And they'll quote something from like episode 42 or something.

52:02.660 --> 52:04.020
And it always cracks me up.

52:04.020 --> 52:05.700
So thanks for that.

52:05.700 --> 52:06.660
Two calls to action.

52:06.660 --> 52:08.660
Go listen to the other Maximum Fun shows.

52:08.660 --> 52:11.620
Throwing Shade, Memory Palace, the new one.

52:11.620 --> 52:13.220
Jordan, Jesse, go stop podcasting yourself.

52:13.220 --> 52:15.540
Judge John Hodgman, International Waters.

52:15.540 --> 52:17.460
All extremely good.

52:17.460 --> 52:18.420
Second call to action.

52:18.420 --> 52:20.100
My Yahoo answer.

52:20.100 --> 52:22.500
I still got a few great standbys.

52:22.500 --> 52:24.660
And thank you so much if you send in the Yahoo answers.

52:24.660 --> 52:26.980
But the well is drying up a little bit.

52:26.980 --> 52:29.140
And that means I have to go find my own answers.

52:29.140 --> 52:30.500
And that's the worst.

52:30.500 --> 52:32.740
So if you feel inspired, email us.

52:32.740 --> 52:36.500
Mbembem at gmail.com or mbembem at maximumfun.org.

52:36.500 --> 52:39.060
And send in some Yahoo's.

52:39.060 --> 52:42.100
Nothing gross, only funnies.

52:42.100 --> 52:42.820
Thanks.

52:42.820 --> 52:43.780
Thanks.

52:43.780 --> 52:46.100
Speaking of Yahoo's, here's the final one of the day.

52:46.100 --> 52:50.740
It was sent in by Jeremy Walker.

52:50.740 --> 52:51.540
Thank you, Jeremy.

52:51.540 --> 52:57.140
It's by Yahoo Answers user swimmer899, who asks,

52:57.140 --> 53:00.660
why do I very often dream that I'm wearing diapers?

53:03.860 --> 53:05.300
I'm Justin McElroy.

53:05.300 --> 53:06.420
I'm Travis McElroy.

53:06.420 --> 53:07.460
I'm Griffin McElroy.

53:07.460 --> 53:08.820
It's been my brother, my brother, and me.

53:08.820 --> 53:09.620
Kiss your dad.

53:09.620 --> 53:11.460
Square on the lips.

53:11.460 --> 53:16.580
Square on the lips.

53:16.580 --> 53:18.260
Keep your heart, Three Stacks.

53:18.260 --> 53:19.300
Keep your heart.

53:19.300 --> 53:21.460
Hey, keep your heart, Three Stacks.

53:21.460 --> 53:22.420
Keep your heart.

53:22.420 --> 53:23.780
Man, these girls are smart.

53:23.780 --> 53:25.540
Three Stacks, these girls are smart.

53:25.540 --> 53:41.460
Three Stacks, keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart.
