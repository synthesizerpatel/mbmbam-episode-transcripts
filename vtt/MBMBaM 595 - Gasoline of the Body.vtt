WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.820 --> 00:50.020
It's better it's better with you

00:53.940 --> 00:56.020
It's better it's better with you

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:10.300 --> 01:15.820
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modular

01:15.820 --> 01:18.600
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:19.500 --> 01:21.380
Travis

01:21.380 --> 01:22.780
Yeah

01:22.780 --> 01:28.660
Yeah, this is Griffin McElroy. This one's good. This one's got Griffin on it. This one does have Griffin in the mix

01:29.300 --> 01:31.060
putting a little bit of

01:31.060 --> 01:33.060
sauce on it and

01:33.740 --> 01:39.700
Yeah, welcome welcome guys. Hey guys, are you gonna ask me about cuz I did it there. No, we're not

01:40.460 --> 01:44.540
Pointedly, we're not doing well cuz I I was thinking about what's fancy. Thank you for asking

01:44.540 --> 01:48.860
I was thinking about what's fancy and I think I was doing too much and that's not fancy and you know

01:48.860 --> 01:54.140
It's fancy like a one name name, you know, that's cool. Yeah. Yeah

01:55.660 --> 02:01.140
Or Kesha. Yes, a lot of people when they think about fancy they think about

02:02.140 --> 02:03.820
aristocratic like

02:03.820 --> 02:08.820
Pass me my right my my very thin toast, right?

02:08.820 --> 02:14.020
I fancy but my main exposure to fancy people has been at

02:14.820 --> 02:19.640
Like a bar, but they're wearing like a business suit. Yeah, and they're like

02:20.700 --> 02:22.860
Why don't you get out of here kid?

02:25.060 --> 02:29.540
Do you know like that, huh? Yeah, like this stinky kid in here

02:29.540 --> 02:35.980
yeah, and but they'll be like the only fancy person in there and yeah, I'll walk up and I'll be like to the bartender be

02:35.980 --> 02:37.980
like can I get a

02:37.980 --> 02:40.500
Drink and then the guy I'll be like

02:42.140 --> 02:48.180
Are you sure about that kid wait, is this the bartender speaking to you or a businessman at the no

02:48.180 --> 02:52.820
It's the businessman sitting at the counter and he's got like fucking 20 babes. Oh

02:53.420 --> 02:57.460
Wow. Well, that's probably why he wants you to get away because he needs those stools for his babes

02:57.460 --> 03:07.060
Yeah, I I whenever I walk up for a big table kid. We didn't make a reservation for my birthday

03:08.020 --> 03:12.980
We forgot to I was supposed to but then I got too busy being rich

03:13.380 --> 03:20.260
It's my 15th birthday kid. I'm so excited to eat here at Applebee's

03:20.820 --> 03:22.820
That's my plane

03:22.820 --> 03:30.580
That right. I crashed it into the Applebee's because I was so excited for the Jack Daniels burger

03:31.460 --> 03:33.460
I'm very hurt

03:34.020 --> 03:39.620
But I'm eating good in the neighborhood kid. My voice box is damaged

03:40.260 --> 03:42.580
That's why I sound like this

03:42.580 --> 03:49.380
He sucks and he sucks the atmosphere the joy out of the Applebee's room that I'm in. Yeah, but fuck he looks cool

03:49.380 --> 03:56.100
He looks so cool. And does he have one name? Is that related to this in any way? He doesn't have any name

03:56.100 --> 04:00.300
Oh, that's how he forgot it in the crash. He forgot it in the crash

04:00.660 --> 04:07.700
He refers to himself as plane because I think maybe like that's the only word he could remember because this head got so fucked

04:07.700 --> 04:09.700
Up in the crash. Yeah

04:09.980 --> 04:16.020
These 20 babes are all paramedics. Yeah, then they're doing a surgery on me

04:16.020 --> 04:23.500
But I can be awake and eat my Jack Daniels burger while they do it. Oh fuck. I see my grandpa

04:23.980 --> 04:25.980
Bye kid

04:25.980 --> 04:33.380
He's been dead for 10 years in case that wasn't clear in this audio format. I hate this bully this 15 year old

04:33.380 --> 04:37.900
This 15 year old fancy bully. Who's dying in the Applebee's. How'd he get so rich?

04:38.700 --> 04:43.460
I don't know. Is he even rich? Is there actually a plane outside? We don't know

04:43.460 --> 04:48.620
We don't know. That's the thing. That's how they get you the fans. Anyway, that's the fancy

04:48.620 --> 04:50.940
I think of and it makes me worried that

04:51.460 --> 04:54.500
Maybe this isn't a good year theme because I don't want to turn into that

04:55.100 --> 04:56.300
No, no

04:56.300 --> 04:57.820
Whoa

04:57.820 --> 05:01.760
That scared the ever-living shit out of me. We got a blart watch

05:05.020 --> 05:08.940
Now if this is okay if this is what I think it is

05:08.940 --> 05:14.580
This is our segment blart watch where we keep you updated on literally every scrap of information

05:15.260 --> 05:20.900
About a possible third Paul Blart movie. Yeah, sometimes sometimes news only covers big moves

05:20.900 --> 05:24.260
We cover even like the involuntary twitches

05:25.420 --> 05:30.980
This has been a segment that we've had for years. Yeah, this is just the first

05:31.860 --> 05:36.900
The segment has been ongoing for years. We've been doing it the last five years. Yeah

05:36.900 --> 05:40.940
Yeah, this has been an ongoing segment Paul Blart mall cop

05:41.500 --> 05:42.580
three

05:42.580 --> 05:48.140
Everyone literally every single human babies come out of the womb first word

05:49.020 --> 05:51.140
Like everybody's asking about it

05:51.940 --> 05:53.620
and

05:53.620 --> 05:58.340
Kevin James, mr. Kevin did dr. Kevin James did a story at the interview

05:58.340 --> 06:00.860
I guess you'd say that turned into a story with screen ramp

06:00.860 --> 06:06.420
And they asked him about it. They're like blart 3. What's up? We've heard a lot of bugs

06:06.700 --> 06:09.340
We've heard a lot of buzz most of it created by us

06:10.220 --> 06:17.420
Okay, and here's what he said and and really like read between the lines. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well

06:18.300 --> 06:21.860
Well, you gotta work that one out. I would love that. I

06:21.860 --> 06:30.820
Don't know what the story is yet, but it was so much fun shooting in Vegas. That was a great time. There's

06:31.700 --> 06:37.380
Something there there's something there right you guys feel that too, right? There's something there

06:37.460 --> 06:42.820
There's something there, but I don't know if it's maybe the thing you think it is so much

06:42.820 --> 06:47.680
Well, no, listen Trav. Huh? You've forgotten history

06:47.680 --> 06:55.160
Kevin James got pretty burnt up in the big Sony hack where they reveal all this stuff about so he can't

06:55.920 --> 07:03.120
Say outright like we're doing it baby because then that the hackers will crash is and they'll find on own

07:03.120 --> 07:09.880
We'll get him and they'll find it his fucking like PowerPoint presentation. That's yeah having fun with friends

07:11.000 --> 07:12.880
Vegas again

07:12.880 --> 07:18.760
Gambling risk and love of family question like the big the big bullet points of three and then we're all gonna be spoiled

07:18.760 --> 07:21.840
Aren't we so instead my man James comes out and does

07:22.440 --> 07:24.040
little

07:24.040 --> 07:31.360
Crypt cryptic little messages for the true fans little ARG's that you really have to dive into right? I think I I

07:32.080 --> 07:34.920
Okay, I'm not saying that's not the case

07:35.040 --> 07:37.960
But I think that maybe one of the clues of the ARG

07:37.960 --> 07:44.120
Here that he's laying down is that he's taken on what I like to think of as the Sandler mentality, which is yeah

07:44.120 --> 07:47.860
I'll do a movie if it's in a place. I would also like to take a vacation

07:49.120 --> 07:54.680
Yeah, oh, yeah. No, no kidding. That's because I mean he throws it right in there when you say hey Kevin James

07:55.000 --> 07:57.840
What you know, we're talking about a third Bart and he's like, oh, yeah

07:57.840 --> 08:01.280
I love making Bart too because I got to go to Las Vegas

08:01.280 --> 08:06.940
I had a lot of fun with my buddies, right and let me say a lot of people can hate on the happy Madison squad

08:06.940 --> 08:12.240
And have a lot of justification for doing so they're living their best lives. They've well, they've they've got it

08:12.240 --> 08:16.680
They're living their best life to their own capacity for best life, I guess

08:16.760 --> 08:24.400
Yeah, but they can probably be using their time better, right? Kevin's reached the point though. We're like he wants to also make

08:25.480 --> 08:29.080
Art and shit like he's like, um, I want to have a good time

08:29.080 --> 08:35.100
But also like it's it's Oscar season. He needs his punch drunk. Love is what he needs. Yeah

08:35.100 --> 08:41.660
Do you say you what? You've been quiet and I feel like usually when you do that you are googling something

08:42.300 --> 08:48.300
I'm just listening to you guys. I did my job. I brought you do you know how hard I had to work to get these scoops?

08:48.620 --> 08:54.260
Yeah, we tweeted it out us Justin. Kevin James is a very religious person. Do you guys know this? Oh, really?

08:55.420 --> 08:57.260
It's a man tracks, right?

08:57.260 --> 09:02.980
If you came to me who's like Kevin James hardcore atheist like I'm really belligerent about it. I'd be like, well really Kevin

09:02.980 --> 09:09.540
Can I tell you something? Here's a quote from a little bit ago. He said I am involved in my faith

09:09.980 --> 09:16.680
It becomes a difficult difficult position. You have a platform and you don't want to do anything that doesn't glorify God in every way

09:17.300 --> 09:20.260
So I just wanted to say that one time

09:20.820 --> 09:24.480
Kevin James was lying on the floor of a Vegas hallway

09:25.340 --> 09:28.940
Interior mall and he lied there while actress

09:29.860 --> 09:31.620
the young actress

09:31.620 --> 09:36.940
Glomped melted ice cream into his mouth. Yeah. Yeah curious diabetes to glorify God

09:36.940 --> 09:42.000
Yeah, and he was thinking like this is glorifying God in every way. Well and everything I'm doing right now

09:42.060 --> 09:45.920
This is this is for God. I'm gonna say this knowing that in four days

09:46.820 --> 09:49.940
So much can change but it is kind of refreshing to hear

09:50.580 --> 09:54.380
Kevin James say that but also not be shitty about it all the time

09:54.900 --> 09:57.500
As happens so often with some people

09:57.500 --> 10:00.580
I've heard some things. Oh, no

10:01.380 --> 10:08.980
Do you I remember in grown-ups too when mr. James burps and farts and sneezes at the same time and it's like you raise me

10:14.300 --> 10:21.100
This actually gives me a lot of hope because I we talked in a I believe this past year's till death do us part

10:21.540 --> 10:23.540
about the possibility of having a

10:23.540 --> 10:29.660
um Paul Blart set in heaven one a place James wants to go to

10:30.100 --> 10:33.500
Would glorify God right? So like we're setting up

10:34.180 --> 10:39.180
Like the two biggest it seems like check marks for a bar three, right?

10:39.760 --> 10:46.120
Now we just need I think some way to get another like maybe get Adam Sandler in there

10:46.220 --> 10:50.860
He reprises his role as little Nicky get the fuck out. Yes. Yes

10:50.860 --> 10:56.340
Yes battle for the fate of humanity. That's good. That's good stuff. Anyway, this is a vice show

10:56.340 --> 10:58.780
I actually just got way too excited about

10:59.980 --> 11:04.440
Like I said it and I felt like I unlocked something like I was doing an escape room

11:04.460 --> 11:07.500
And I just found like a three-letter word somewhere

11:07.500 --> 11:11.580
I'm in the creative process and we like to do that here where there are no stakes and no one listens

11:11.580 --> 11:19.420
To absolutely and also no next step like I said follow up. Yeah, I'm not yeah. I'm not gonna create like a

11:22.300 --> 11:23.740
You the listener

11:23.740 --> 11:29.100
My sister's fiance only drinks out of empty mason jars when they visit my parents night. Mm-hmm

11:29.100 --> 11:31.220
At first I thought we were just out of glasses

11:31.220 --> 11:35.820
Which is weird because we have so many glasses that it's hard to fit them all in a cupboard when they're all washed

11:35.820 --> 11:39.740
Oh, don't you hate that whenever somebody gets to be new mugs at this point?

11:39.740 --> 11:42.500
I'm like, well, some of y'all are going to the farm. Come on

11:43.940 --> 11:48.740
For all the mugs I own I've already curated my mug collection to a point where I they all spark joy

11:48.740 --> 11:51.060
I'm so I'm so picky about mugs

11:51.580 --> 11:55.780
So pick you know that the Austin City limits mugs that you guys guys given those are perfect

11:55.780 --> 12:00.380
Yeah, this guy bigger than the stand. I can't have a standard 12-ounce mung. Look now now

12:00.380 --> 12:01.460
Are you kidding me?

12:01.460 --> 12:06.100
After it happened a few times we decided to hide the darts in a different cabinet to sway him away from them

12:06.100 --> 12:11.340
So they he went to get some water and walk back to the living room with you guessed it a mason jar

12:11.340 --> 12:15.060
Is there something wrong with our glasses? Who is this jar man?

12:15.060 --> 12:21.840
Does he know something that we don't that's from novel sipping in Nova Scotia now we grew up in a house where our mom

12:22.380 --> 12:23.820
would

12:23.820 --> 12:25.020
routinely

12:25.020 --> 12:29.340
Clean out jelly jars. Oh, yeah, and they would become the cups. Those are the cups for you

12:29.340 --> 12:31.620
Now these are what we drink out of these jelly jars

12:31.620 --> 12:37.420
Which is I think I I think it says a lot bad sad things that society's moved away from that

12:37.540 --> 12:44.120
Because I remember time where Welch's if I remember correctly it was was it Garfield themed like inside

12:44.120 --> 12:50.140
Oh, those were the fucking days baby, and it was like yo, you finished this tiny jelly jar. Hey, guess what?

12:50.380 --> 12:57.800
It's Garfield Garfield cup now, baby. Enjoy your liquid and now we're all just like using cups. Oh

12:57.800 --> 13:01.620
Oh now I will say there's one aspect of this question that

13:02.580 --> 13:09.380
And we I mean, I you know, we're all about context on the show and I just kind of context like yes, I assume

13:10.140 --> 13:14.100
That he rooted through the kitchen and found one of the mason jars you hid

13:14.420 --> 13:16.940
But it does leave just enough wiggle room for me to wonder

13:17.260 --> 13:23.200
Did he bring his own mason jar just in case he couldn't find a mason jar. That's interesting

13:23.200 --> 13:29.960
Hey, let me say this fuck glasses the glass fuck glass cups. Okay, I will always

13:30.760 --> 13:35.800
spring for a plastic cup over a glass cup because I don't know who had this idea of

13:36.360 --> 13:42.400
Hey, let's take this stuff that gets really really crazy sharp when you do a whoopsie with it

13:42.400 --> 13:49.500
I put it as close to our mouth and face as we possibly get like you you it's an unnecessary risk, isn't it?

13:49.500 --> 13:56.300
I bet there is if I drop a plastic cup worst thing that happens liquid on the floor if I drop a glass

13:57.100 --> 14:02.620
Liquid on the floor and also a bunch of invisible knives everywhere. Cool. Awesome

14:02.620 --> 14:09.100
I bet it was so fucking frustrating for the like scientists that invented like the polycarbonate to make cups out of and they're like we did

14:09.100 --> 14:16.100
It we changed the game. Everyone's gonna be safe now. No more. Okay time for you guys to all start. Why aren't they?

14:16.100 --> 14:20.420
Okay, you know cuz we did it so everybody can start you're still buying

14:21.060 --> 14:23.060
Glass though. Why is everybody?

14:23.460 --> 14:24.740
normalize

14:24.740 --> 14:29.180
Plastic glass plastic stemware normalize it. Yes. Oh my god

14:29.180 --> 14:34.060
I've shreked so many glasses over just by turning my huge terrible body around

14:34.860 --> 14:35.760
I

14:35.760 --> 14:42.100
Smash a glass now it also like to have a five-year-old and now a two-year-old that I smash something and they just yell like oh

14:42.100 --> 14:48.140
No, or what did you do? And it's like I know don't also didn't want to do this

14:48.140 --> 14:52.380
Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy made a big purple mess and also invisible knives everywhere

14:52.380 --> 14:59.020
Have fun. You're gonna stay on that chair and never walk on the ground ever again. It's ridiculous. Get that glass out of here

14:59.020 --> 15:05.820
Anyway, and without fail I will like hands and knees like scour that place to try to pick up all the glass and then two

15:05.820 --> 15:09.940
Hours later Teresa will come to him back. Hey, did you break a glass? I'm like, yeah, she's like yeah

15:09.940 --> 15:12.460
There was glass everywhere. I'm like where I

15:13.060 --> 15:17.940
think a mason jar is one of those things that is charming it like

15:19.260 --> 15:21.260
aesthetically, right it is

15:22.540 --> 15:28.100
By definition kind of a cutesy thing to drink out. We got me and Rachel got married in, Texas

15:28.100 --> 15:33.180
So, of course we came home from that wedding with approximately six hundred thousand mason jars

15:33.380 --> 15:36.300
Yeah, and we drink out of before a while, but then eventually we were like

15:36.300 --> 15:42.140
This is this is too many of the same type of thing that is made out of glass to have in our home

15:42.140 --> 15:45.060
And so we took it out on the street. We threw them on cars that went by

15:46.060 --> 15:51.380
No, wait, wait, like that's bonding. That's a romantic thing for us to do

15:52.560 --> 15:58.660
Hey, can we approach the Wizards throne? Wait, just real quick. I'm betting that this is like his thing, you know

15:58.660 --> 16:03.220
I mean, I'm the mason jar guy, you know, this is that's interesting. I'm a cowboy

16:03.220 --> 16:07.540
baby, I drink out of mason jars that don't

16:08.620 --> 16:10.180
sleep inside

16:10.180 --> 16:16.900
Probably part of it. It's just like you get used. I'm like I said, like I like four cups

16:17.580 --> 16:19.580
There's four cups. I like

16:19.820 --> 16:24.480
Maybe that's just all he likes. He doesn't it doesn't make him feel good to drink out of other cups

16:24.820 --> 16:29.420
Maybe you have like I don't want to be this guy. But like maybe you have bad guys

16:29.420 --> 16:35.660
Ooh, does he got big hands and you got a little thing cups and makes him feel like a monster because that happens to me

16:35.660 --> 16:39.500
Sometimes I'm just saying it's possible. You have bad cups. This is true

16:39.500 --> 16:45.220
Maybe he's never used a cup before and he sees your cups and he's like, I bet that's for science

16:45.220 --> 16:47.220
I'm gonna use the drinking jars

16:48.120 --> 16:50.120
interesting interesting

16:50.140 --> 16:55.260
Okay, so this this this little magic spell from the wizard is a great wait

16:55.260 --> 16:59.940
Is he approaching us? Did he bring it to us this time? We approach each other and been home

16:59.940 --> 17:02.740
That's nice Ben can't kind of facilitated it. Thank you, Ben

17:03.660 --> 17:06.020
It's how to find gifts for people who bug you

17:06.860 --> 17:08.580
wait, oh

17:08.580 --> 17:09.900
I guess

17:09.900 --> 17:15.940
Did you just cough and mute it because it sounded like you just gasped like a like an actual dinosaur

17:16.220 --> 17:19.340
I'm a radio and professional. I don't like to come off into the mic

17:19.340 --> 17:22.060
So I do like how you let us see other build up to it though

17:22.060 --> 17:27.000
Yeah, well, I wasn't that quick on the trigger, but it kind of came out of nowhere. I'm gonna start reading

17:30.500 --> 17:36.340
There's something there so funny there are people in life that no matter how hard you try to be open and think good of

17:36.500 --> 17:40.020
Bug you for one reason or other. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder what that's like

17:40.580 --> 17:43.620
Finding gift for these people could be imagine doing a podcast with them

17:44.580 --> 17:47.060
Because your head bugs you that much listen

17:47.060 --> 17:52.500
Fine age for these people can be really really hard because your head is saying find the cheapest nastiest thing out there while your heart

17:52.500 --> 17:54.380
Wants to do the right thing

17:54.380 --> 18:01.860
So this I guess is their way of threading that needle although it is I would say it it trends much more toward the

18:02.220 --> 18:05.940
Nastiest cheapest thing out there side of things. So it's not wait

18:05.940 --> 18:11.100
It's not about what the your heart was the right thing. Yeah, you have to be the bigger proof

18:11.100 --> 18:13.940
So they're annoying but you're great

18:13.940 --> 18:18.500
So yeah, you're gonna give them a bunch of really clever gifts juice. This first one's great for you

18:18.500 --> 18:20.500
So I'm just a hot tip

18:20.900 --> 18:26.800
Purchase a large wooden spoon for the troublemaker in your family or workplace that person who is always causing trouble

18:27.180 --> 18:31.600
Stirring up a mess and sticking their nose where it isn't wanted this gift says watch it

18:31.600 --> 18:36.860
We think you're a pot stirrer for the less obtuse. This present is nicely pointed

18:36.860 --> 18:44.340
So what was so fucking wicked? This is already can I say the wildest one of these?

18:44.340 --> 18:49.020
I've ever yeah, this is off to such a tremendously forceful start

18:49.020 --> 18:49.740
Yeah

18:49.740 --> 18:56.540
What if me and Travis spent the whole episode making fun of your dumb cough and then two days later you shipped us

18:56.860 --> 19:00.740
Big wooden spoons and you're like get it you fucking jerks

19:00.740 --> 19:07.900
Well, I'll ship you like tiny wooden coffins and be like now who's coffee. Whoa. Wait, that might be

19:09.060 --> 19:10.980
Can I say something though?

19:10.980 --> 19:17.260
Fuck I love wooden cookware. Oh my god. Oh, I was a tiny wooden coffin. I'd actually think I was really cool

19:18.540 --> 19:22.740
Yeah. Oh, yeah, you know, I've got a spoon chilla made out of wood

19:22.740 --> 19:28.340
It's got a slot on the side where it can rest on your pant on your hell. Yeah. Oh, I

19:28.340 --> 19:31.780
Love this guy. That's it, baby

19:31.780 --> 19:36.580
Now, let me just say that if I were the receiver of a giant spoon and I wouldn't say I'm obtuse

19:37.340 --> 19:39.900
You know compared to I don't know. I'm probably

19:40.700 --> 19:43.820
Slightly above average as far as not being obtuse goes

19:43.820 --> 19:46.300
I think I would open it and be like what the fuck is this?

19:46.300 --> 19:50.340
I think someone would have to say cuz you're always stirring up the pot

19:50.340 --> 19:53.340
I'm like, so you went to a lot of trouble, huh?

19:53.340 --> 19:59.020
I'm like because I know you can't just pick up giant spoons like this anywhere you go

19:59.020 --> 20:04.900
Is this cuz why hey, just give me a big box of dirt or so next time man

20:06.100 --> 20:09.860
This next one goes I would say in the polar opposite direction

20:10.540 --> 20:15.180
Wrap up some personal hygiene products for the person who never bathes or who breathes down your neck

20:15.580 --> 20:21.740
Lasciviously even though this person knows you're taken those are two profoundly different things. That is yeah. Hey

20:21.740 --> 20:25.100
Yeah, I got you this hygiene kit cuz you stink and hey Marcus

20:25.100 --> 20:27.980
I got you this one cuz you're trying to fuck me and I don't yeah

20:27.980 --> 20:32.480
I I would actually argue the person who's trying to fuck you and you give them a bunch of like

20:33.300 --> 20:38.380
Bath and shower stuff. Yes, that seems like make yourself ready Marcus. Yeah

20:39.140 --> 20:41.260
Going down on Sunday, dude

20:41.260 --> 20:42.260
and

20:42.260 --> 20:48.440
Can I also just say this kind of makes it seem like how to be a bully because if you're like, oh, you know

20:48.440 --> 20:52.020
That guy he really bugs me because of his hygiene issues

20:52.020 --> 20:58.580
And I'm gonna call it out in front of everyone at the white elephant party or whatever and be like, whoa in middle school

20:59.300 --> 21:01.020
At Comac middle school

21:01.020 --> 21:07.660
The most brutal thing you could do to somebody for a good long time was to walk up to them and say take a bath

21:07.860 --> 21:12.780
Wash yourself. Yeah, and people would do that to each other and the other person would just

21:13.340 --> 21:15.340
Crumble they would collapse in on themselves

21:15.340 --> 21:22.580
Like a dying star like oh fuck. There's no come back to that. You can't be like no actually you're the one with bad hygiene

21:23.740 --> 21:25.180
Anyway, yeah

21:25.180 --> 21:31.660
This one's great blaster first. There's no yeah, you can't come back with that cuz it's like oh you would say that even if

21:32.020 --> 21:37.580
You have impeccable hygiene. This one you also can't say like I bathed this morning Derek

21:39.580 --> 21:44.020
This one is so fucking brutal if I ever got this one

21:44.020 --> 21:46.420
I would oh I would just leave

21:47.140 --> 21:51.060
Give that lazy son-in-law a cooking set and a food processor

21:51.140 --> 21:55.640
It's time. He understood that cooking is for anyone in the household. Not just your daughter

21:56.340 --> 22:03.020
Holy crap. Yeah now, okay. This is can I just say assuming a lot of things?

22:03.580 --> 22:09.640
sometimes people share responsibilities and sometimes people split responsibilities and it's a like

22:09.640 --> 22:17.700
This is a wild thing to do, right? Not only that but it's also like hey Derek you lazy fuck. Here's

22:18.920 --> 22:25.680
$750 in William Sonoma cookware and it's like, yeah. Oh my thank you. Holy shit. This is beautiful. This is a no

22:25.680 --> 22:31.640
You don't get it. You need to learn to cook. Well, I will now this is awesome. Thank you. Great. Thanks

22:31.640 --> 22:33.760
I feel like my message isn't landing

22:33.760 --> 22:42.200
Uh, the that one that can never be punctual let them know that they're always being late for everything is annoying by buying them

22:42.200 --> 22:45.440
A watch so next time they late you can ask them. What's wrong with the watch?

22:45.440 --> 22:51.000
I got you once again, like if someone got me a watch I'm like, oh, it's beautiful. Thank you. Like got him

22:51.960 --> 22:54.440
This next one's not fucking weird at all

22:54.440 --> 22:56.440
So perish the thought of it being weird

22:56.440 --> 23:04.280
But give a sexy lingerie set to the prim and proper daughter-in-law who is driving you crazy with her perfectness. Oh, what?

23:04.280 --> 23:06.280
Got him. What?

23:06.760 --> 23:08.760
Hey, hey

23:09.880 --> 23:10.800
Samantha

23:10.800 --> 23:17.400
I've been stuck on the name Samantha. I feel bad that I I feel like we're on a Samantha like try Judith

23:18.120 --> 23:19.920
Hey Judith

23:19.920 --> 23:21.920
You're so prim and proper

23:22.360 --> 23:24.360
Check out this sexy lingerie

23:24.360 --> 23:26.080
Marjorie

23:26.080 --> 23:32.840
It's gonna say like maybe it's from the mom in this but even then there is no scenario in which this isn't like

23:33.800 --> 23:38.440
Both curvy and also kind of like have fun having sex with my kid

23:38.440 --> 23:42.080
Oh, sorry, then the next couple sentences are pretty dope

23:42.320 --> 23:47.320
She'll be embarrassed at what possible thoughts are going through your head about her relations with your son

23:47.400 --> 23:52.640
But your son will be totally cool with all this but be forewarned that given even as a joke

23:52.640 --> 23:58.860
You may forever be labeled as a dirty old man or woman by everyone present. Yeah, it seems like a good trade-off worth it

23:59.600 --> 24:01.600
Worth the risk. No

24:03.120 --> 24:05.560
Okay, okay, that's great

24:06.480 --> 24:13.360
What happens though if your sign gives you a big thumbs up like thanks guys. Thanks dad. This is gonna give me mad voters

24:14.120 --> 24:15.320
a

24:15.320 --> 24:21.720
Lot of stuff about in-laws because this next one is give uncaring parents-in-law a large photo of you in a beautiful frame

24:21.720 --> 24:23.640
I'm actually so into this

24:23.640 --> 24:29.040
So they didn't put your picture out with the rest of the family or at least not one large enough to match the others make it

24:29.040 --> 24:32.920
Up make up for it with this wonderful in-your-face addition to the family photo collection

24:32.920 --> 24:38.960
It's a difficult gift to wriggle out of displaying. Make sure your smile is large. I feel like my smile is always large

24:38.960 --> 24:42.800
are we talking like like I'd like a like a two by

24:43.320 --> 24:46.480
Like what are we talking like a giant, you know

24:46.480 --> 24:53.560
Like would go over the mantle four foot by eight foot kind of deal because I'm way into that like hey

24:53.800 --> 24:55.800
I got you this

24:56.480 --> 25:01.320
And I expect to see it every time I come over and I could come over anytime

25:01.520 --> 25:07.400
there's an amazing illustration here of what looks like a crash test dummy with a wig on holding up a picture frame of

25:07.880 --> 25:10.800
Himself and it's about the size of his torso. So that's a big one

25:10.800 --> 25:14.280
Hey, how come we never use the adjective large to describe somebody smile?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.160
a

25:16.160 --> 25:17.120
beautiful

25:17.120 --> 25:21.520
Large would if you were talking about like the Cheshire cat or some kind of demon

25:22.440 --> 25:27.080
That's fair. Make a whistle and stopwatch kit. Give this to the bossy person in your life

25:27.080 --> 25:30.800
It sends a message to them that you haven't exactly enjoyed their need to tell you what to do and when

25:31.400 --> 25:38.020
So really this this article should be titled how to tell the people annoying you that they fucking suck

25:38.520 --> 25:41.820
But also you spent money on it. Yeah, but also in like

25:41.820 --> 25:46.300
the most annoying way possible like also the most like

25:46.860 --> 25:52.520
Give me a second to let me just explain why this do you get it? I'm sick of your shit

25:52.740 --> 25:58.540
You don't get this but it's like honestly like a really good burn and just give me a second to explain it to you

25:58.540 --> 26:03.660
Please now I do actually like this because it could be fuel for your frustration fire that you're like

26:03.660 --> 26:10.260
I put together this fucking great whistle and stopwatch bit and then this asshole didn't even bother to get the joke

26:10.260 --> 26:12.260
fuck him I

26:16.540 --> 26:20.300
Consider music what person consider music a song, you know

26:20.300 --> 26:24.780
They don't they don't much like can turn into an entire CD by the artist in question after they open it

26:24.780 --> 26:27.700
It's that's a sorry a song, you know

26:27.700 --> 26:34.940
They don't much like can turn into an entire CD by the artist in question if you bury it in the ground

26:34.940 --> 26:40.940
I think yeah, I think that their language here is a bit more passive

26:42.380 --> 26:47.700
Like it can't turn into that with some I don't know the machinations given the right circumstances

26:48.300 --> 26:50.580
After they open it insist they play it for everyone to hear

26:50.580 --> 26:53.520
This is a great Christmas showstopper an album or mixy

26:53.860 --> 27:00.660
That touch on your frustration with this person can also have an interesting effect. Everyone clear your schedules for the next 45 minutes

27:00.660 --> 27:08.580
Yeah, I've made an Enrique Iglesias mixy day and we're all gonna sit here and listen to it cuz cuz Dave doesn't like by Lamos

27:08.580 --> 27:14.500
Yeah, hey doesn't like by Lamos. Hey dad put that CD on that. I got you sure son click

27:18.540 --> 27:24.180
That's right, I have frustration with you provide I was just gonna say I love rage against the machine

27:24.180 --> 27:27.660
Yeah, sure provide a set of knives to someone who backstabbed you

27:27.660 --> 27:34.380
Well, it doesn't have to be real knives plastic toy ones from the dollar store still carry the message perfectly. Well, yeah

27:34.380 --> 27:41.500
Just get this person knives and a spoon and a cookware set and their kitchen is furnished. Well done. You got him

27:42.020 --> 27:44.020
Got a wiki how author

27:44.660 --> 27:52.580
if I opened okay, you're telling me that me opening a set of like real ass like kitchen knives and

27:52.580 --> 27:58.060
An opening a dollar store by a beautiful ornate

27:58.060 --> 28:03.980
Yeah, it's nice is the same message as me opening a set of dollar store

28:04.860 --> 28:10.640
Plastic like toy knives and I'd be like, oh I get it. I'm a backstab. Yeah. Got it

28:11.500 --> 28:14.580
Keep your sense of humor throughout this exercise. It's meant to be a light-hearted

28:15.140 --> 28:19.460
Weird kind of say something if you have a box of knives in a tasteful case

28:19.460 --> 28:23.020
Yeah, and you wrap it up and you give it to someone and they open it and they're like, oh

28:24.260 --> 28:32.520
Look at this. This is lovely. Thank you so much. So that's that but if you take a single knife and just wrap it

28:34.220 --> 28:40.480
Sort of like unconsciously in wrapping paper. Yeah, and then give it to the person then they get all weird about it

28:40.480 --> 28:43.700
It's like I'm sorry. I couldn't afford a whole set but like you don't need to be

28:43.700 --> 28:49.220
Weird about and if you deliver those knives to them like to their front door anonymously one at a time

28:49.700 --> 28:56.220
Like over a long period of time like stab into a pumpkin or whatever or just like wrapped in a Kroger bag or something

28:56.220 --> 29:00.140
Yeah, you know and and suddenly you're arrested

29:00.660 --> 29:06.980
That sucks. Yeah, I'm just trying to send the message that you're a backstabber Stephen. Keep a kid sense of humor

29:06.980 --> 29:09.540
It's meant to be a light-hearted response to real challenges that you're facing

29:09.540 --> 29:15.420
And it may backfire with some recipients if that is an outcome you're prepared to face these gift ideas might be for you

29:15.420 --> 29:20.260
If not try more constructive means for approaching the nagging mother-in-law the overbearing boss

29:20.780 --> 29:22.780
the faithless lover

29:25.260 --> 29:30.400
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas Diane Oh plastic knives. Yeah. Yeah, I know

29:30.400 --> 29:38.920
I know. Wait you got me and John the same present. Yeah, I know

29:40.560 --> 29:46.200
Can I just say a quick question here. I got you a cuckoo clock because I know I

29:46.680 --> 29:48.880
Know what you've done to me in my own house

29:48.880 --> 29:56.680
And also here's a big spoon John you pot-stirrer. I got you the big spoon and her the little spoon because I know

29:56.680 --> 29:58.680
everything. I know

29:58.680 --> 30:03.760
Ding-dong cuckoo cuckoo. Wait, you actually made the bird say cuckoo. Yes

30:03.760 --> 30:10.880
I did a lot of free time since you've been entertaining my wife and you you recognize that voice. That's Steve Goomba

30:10.880 --> 30:12.880
I got him to do it on cameo

30:14.520 --> 30:17.760
Worth it. Can I also just say real big just a little note?

30:17.760 --> 30:23.600
I love that they say these might backfire it is unclear to me what the front fire hope is like

30:24.240 --> 30:28.080
What were you hoping would fire out of me? I guess you got me

30:28.080 --> 30:32.900
I love this and it's taught me a lesson about not bugging you. I guess the last one is just an image

30:32.900 --> 30:36.020
I want maybe we can share it on the sushi after this episode comes up

30:36.020 --> 30:37.640
I'm gonna send it to you guys in a minute

30:37.640 --> 30:44.320
But the title is for those bad folks bad-mouthing you while their glass house reveals that one or both of them are married to someone else

30:44.560 --> 30:49.000
Paper mache initials painted red either with a craft brooch pin on the back or hanger for a tree

30:49.120 --> 30:53.280
Most won't get the scarlet letter reference, but you will that's fucking well

30:53.680 --> 30:57.960
What's even wilder is that that tool tip is accompanied by this image?

30:57.960 --> 30:59.960
Which I've just sent to you boys on slack

31:02.960 --> 31:04.600
What

31:04.600 --> 31:07.760
This is deep. This is a deep. This is a demon

31:08.160 --> 31:09.880
This is a demon with the current

31:09.880 --> 31:16.020
It looks like a monster from a Dragon Ball or something like somebody's like kind of a lot a sloppy one

31:16.020 --> 31:17.760
I'm kind of falling down a hole slow

31:17.760 --> 31:18.560
it's like a

31:18.560 --> 31:23.680
looks like somebody was doing like their math homework and started doodling on the side of this and

31:23.680 --> 31:28.040
Like I got real like just got way too into this creature. They were making

31:28.760 --> 31:36.240
The the the picture is wild for those folks bad-mouthing you while their glass house reveals that one or both of them are married

31:36.240 --> 31:38.240
to someone else

31:38.240 --> 31:40.240
What is that? What? What is that Mary?

31:40.800 --> 31:48.440
What does that mean one or both of them how to reveal people? You knows his infidelities use this demon

31:48.440 --> 31:56.360
This demon will shout in the middle of the city. Hey, I heard that John Judith were together John and Judith been

31:58.440 --> 32:04.400
Anyways, here's an ornament for your Christmas tree. It's a scarlet letter. We couldn't find an a though. So it's a D

32:04.400 --> 32:08.720
Do it. Do you get it still anyway time to turn you all into stone?

32:10.040 --> 32:13.560
That's not part of the thing. That's just for me. That's for me

32:13.560 --> 32:19.360
So also Stephen said he wants to try to work it out still and that's really how to zap

32:20.360 --> 32:25.520
Zap them folks. You hate those with nice things from Williamson Sonoma. Oh

32:26.400 --> 32:33.520
Okay. Yeah, Justin is broadcasting so hard. He's having a nosebleed. So it's time to go to the money's on no

32:33.520 --> 32:36.160
I want to I mean, okay, we can channel that energy

32:36.160 --> 32:42.920
In the money zone, I guess. Yeah, you guys got this. I'll be right back

32:48.920 --> 32:52.800
Hey Griffin, this isn't for the show, but I was wondering do you know anything?

32:53.520 --> 32:57.520
About babble that you could tell me not not like all like off-air. Oh

32:58.640 --> 33:00.640
Shit. Yeah

33:01.080 --> 33:04.200
Yeah, it's like a like dope way to learn a new language

33:04.200 --> 33:08.560
Because it's just like it's so easy

33:08.560 --> 33:14.160
You do these like 15 minute lessons that make it so simple to learn a new language on the go

33:14.360 --> 33:17.280
Yeah, and like they have 14 different languages

33:17.640 --> 33:23.220
Including Spanish French Italian and German they have German. Yeah

33:23.600 --> 33:28.420
Yes, and they also it's not just like you they are like say

33:28.420 --> 33:34.260
Bueno and then they're like we trust that you said it, right?

33:34.260 --> 33:39.940
They have speech recognition technology that helps you improve your pronunciation and accent. Oh, I could really use that

33:39.940 --> 33:43.700
I know. Do you have any way that I could like save money on it though?

33:44.260 --> 33:46.260
I mean they do

33:46.580 --> 33:48.660
Unfortunately not for us but for our listeners

33:48.660 --> 33:53.300
Yes, because when you purchase a three-month babble subscription, you can get an additional three months for free

33:53.300 --> 33:54.940
That's six months for the price of three

33:54.940 --> 34:00.860
If you go to babble.com and use promo code my brother all one word, that's a b a b b e l.com code

34:00.860 --> 34:05.340

34:05.340 --> 34:10.820
Are we not supposed to be using our own promo codes because I do that all the time. Am I gonna get in trouble?

34:10.820 --> 34:15.420
I did actually just sign up for something that we have advertised for in the past and

34:15.740 --> 34:21.060
Punched in my promo go like I heard about this one from a little show from my three favorite guys

35:02.380 --> 35:06.740

38:09.820 --> 38:15.020
I don't know what will you know what I mean? Like no one else is out here playing hurt everybody

38:15.020 --> 38:19.740
Conan O'Brien gets a nosebleed and he takes two weeks off. Yeah, you know what I mean? Like

38:20.380 --> 38:22.380
I think consistently producing a good

38:23.260 --> 38:25.740
Quality show is probably the best way to get awards

38:26.300 --> 38:30.060
Okay, Griffin. Yeah, but what about stunts? There we go

38:30.780 --> 38:36.300
Can we do a stunt right now? I'm gonna freeze myself in a block of ice and hang over time

38:36.300 --> 38:41.420
I'm gonna freeze myself in a block of ice and hang over time square for the rest of this episode

38:41.740 --> 38:46.380
I could do the I could do we finally have saltines. I could do the saltine challenge if we need a stunt

38:47.580 --> 38:49.580
Finally, how long have you been looking?

38:49.820 --> 38:56.540
For the saltine. I just happen to have saltines now as we're recording and thinking about saltines and stunts came came up

38:56.620 --> 38:59.740
That's all yeah saying cool. So I don't badass man

39:00.780 --> 39:04.060
I don't need to do this stunt though. If you guys think it's kind of like childish

39:04.060 --> 39:06.700
I mean, it's definitely childish, but that doesn't mean you don't need to do it

39:06.700 --> 39:10.060
But I'd like you to do it on your own first to see how it goes because if you dies

39:10.460 --> 39:13.260
I would like it to not be on the phone with me

39:13.820 --> 39:16.940
That's not funny. It doesn't have to be funny. It'll go

39:18.060 --> 39:19.260
What?

39:19.260 --> 39:23.820
like if I do it by myself, then I'll know how it'll go and then I do it here and it's like

39:24.540 --> 39:28.300
Whatever, you know what I mean? You don't think David Blaine practices his stunts at home

39:28.300 --> 39:35.420
No, every time he's like fuck. I hope I hope this works. I fucked it up again. I'm gonna put myself in a giant fishbowl

39:35.740 --> 39:39.580
Can you swim? No, no, I can't. Bye

39:40.460 --> 39:42.460
um, yeah, like I did uh, I

39:43.020 --> 39:45.020
speaking of dares the um

39:45.580 --> 39:50.380
Arby's has a new diablo dare sandwich. Yeah, right. Yeah, you can get it in like

39:50.940 --> 39:52.140
beef

39:52.140 --> 39:54.140
Or chicken. Are you saying beef?

39:54.140 --> 39:56.140
Beef? They have it in beef

39:56.140 --> 39:58.940
and it's like you could get it and it's supposed to be like

39:59.420 --> 40:05.180
This is so fucking spicy do a tiktok of how you eat it. It'll kill you. It'll die in real life

40:05.580 --> 40:07.580
and I tried it it's like

40:08.220 --> 40:11.260
A little spicy. It was like it's just a little spicy

40:11.980 --> 40:13.260
Cool, man

40:13.260 --> 40:17.100
Well, I recorded the audio because I was thinking like oh this will be so fun

40:17.500 --> 40:23.580
I'll play it on the show and like it'll be great to bring to the show and it's just this audio of me like

40:23.580 --> 40:29.660
Like eating a mildly spicy sandwich. It's like this is a pod. This isn't even podcast worthy

40:30.220 --> 40:32.220
And that's saying something

40:32.220 --> 40:33.020
Yeah

40:33.020 --> 40:37.100
Uh, is this a munch squad? Are we did you back door? Okay

40:37.340 --> 40:42.220
No, it's just just friends talking about but we don't but it's not a bit. You know what I mean?

40:43.100 --> 40:46.460
What do you mean? Well on this show we do on this show we do bits

40:47.500 --> 40:49.420
Oh, so you prefer me to be like dumb

40:49.420 --> 40:52.560
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba yeah, that's good. Um, exactly

40:55.980 --> 40:57.980
I want a munch

40:58.140 --> 41:00.140
No, i'm not going to go

41:01.260 --> 41:03.260
I want a munch squad

41:05.660 --> 41:12.240
Welcome our squad it's podcast within a podcast profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating

41:12.300 --> 41:13.820
I have two lessons for you real quick

41:13.820 --> 41:16.860
There are some levels of energy that I feel comfortable i'm eating you at

41:16.860 --> 41:20.940
And then there are some that I just can't, I can't get to.

41:20.940 --> 41:21.780
Yeah.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.540
That didn't confront me.

41:23.540 --> 41:24.380
It's all good.

41:24.380 --> 41:25.200
Okay.

41:25.200 --> 41:26.040
It didn't bother me.

41:26.040 --> 41:28.620
I'm out here on my own, a star sailor, you know?

41:28.620 --> 41:30.040
I've always said that about you.

41:30.040 --> 41:30.880
Yes.

41:30.880 --> 41:31.700
I don't need a tether.

41:31.700 --> 41:32.620
I'm like the little prince.

41:32.620 --> 41:35.880
I just grabbed a comet, my net, and I'm zooming away.

41:35.880 --> 41:36.720
You know, it's all right.

41:36.720 --> 41:37.540
You can't come with me.

41:37.540 --> 41:38.380
Oh, I did mean to tell you,

41:38.380 --> 41:40.100
I finished that drawing of a sheep you asked me for,

41:40.100 --> 41:42.300
but I did draw it inside a box so it wouldn't eat your rose.

41:42.300 --> 41:43.220
Here you go.

41:43.220 --> 41:45.380
That's an NFT, so that is going to cost you

41:45.380 --> 41:47.020
about 50,000.

41:47.020 --> 41:49.340
Our line of NFTs is coming.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.180
Yes.

41:50.180 --> 41:51.000
It's all little prince-themed.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.420
It's all little prince-themed.

41:52.420 --> 41:56.180
Make sure you water the NFTs roots and not their petals.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.060
Thank you very much.

41:57.060 --> 41:59.180
God, guys, if you missed a few weeks ago

41:59.180 --> 42:02.460
when Richard Karn was like, I'm fully doing an NFT,

42:02.460 --> 42:04.200
and then everybody's like, fuck off.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.540
And then he's like, I've thought about this.

42:06.540 --> 42:08.700
Now is not the right time for me to enter the NFT market.

42:08.700 --> 42:11.740
Yeah, now is not the moment for my NFT.

42:11.740 --> 42:15.660
So McDonald's is going to start serving fan-inspired mashups.

42:15.660 --> 42:16.820
Huh.

42:16.820 --> 42:18.260
Menu hacks.

42:19.780 --> 42:22.380
Order by name and build by hand.

42:22.380 --> 42:24.100
Do you know what I'm saying to you right now?

42:24.100 --> 42:27.940
What I'm saying to you is you will order the menu hack,

42:27.940 --> 42:32.780
they will give you the components of the hack,

42:32.780 --> 42:34.140
then you do it.

42:34.140 --> 42:35.140
Huh.

42:35.140 --> 42:36.100
Then you make this.

42:36.100 --> 42:39.380
That seems like the opposite of why I go to a place

42:39.380 --> 42:40.580
to get food. It feels like them

42:40.580 --> 42:43.100
trying to limit their liability, right?

42:43.100 --> 42:46.520
Like you order it and they'll give it to you,

42:46.520 --> 42:48.220
but they're not going to hand it to you.

42:48.220 --> 42:49.060
Like they're not going to,

42:49.060 --> 42:52.380
they're going to hand you the bullets and the pistol,

42:52.380 --> 42:54.220
but they're not actually going to load it for you.

42:54.220 --> 42:57.400
I still want you to feel like it's a hack.

42:57.400 --> 43:00.380
And also they don't want to do the work.

43:00.380 --> 43:01.600
But it's kind of bad-ass, right?

43:01.600 --> 43:04.300
It's kind of like Korean barbecue, you know?

43:05.580 --> 43:08.660
When is McDonald's going to install a grill

43:08.660 --> 43:10.500
right there in the middle of my car,

43:10.500 --> 43:13.980
come into my car, make the burger for me while I watch?

43:13.980 --> 43:15.260
I got two of these to get through.

43:15.260 --> 43:18.260
This is starting January 31st, only in the app.

43:19.660 --> 43:20.940
I want you guys to guess what these are.

43:20.940 --> 43:23.320
The first one is a gimme, hash brown McMuffin.

43:23.320 --> 43:24.160
Is it McMuffin with a hash brown?

43:24.160 --> 43:25.500
Oh, it's a McMuffin with a hash brown, yeah.

43:25.500 --> 43:27.380
Sausage McMuffin with egg and hash brown.

43:27.380 --> 43:28.220
Great. Yum.

43:28.220 --> 43:30.280
That should already be a thing, by the way.

43:30.280 --> 43:32.420
What is that? Intuders parlance.

43:32.420 --> 43:33.980
Is that a mountain ear?

43:33.980 --> 43:36.280
I think that's a mountain ear.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.740
I only get a raw beef, so I don't know.

43:38.740 --> 43:39.900
Crunchy double.

43:39.900 --> 43:40.740
Yeah.

43:40.740 --> 43:43.860
This is a sausage sandwich with bacon on it?

43:43.860 --> 43:44.820
No, this is the-

43:44.820 --> 43:46.020
That is the only breakfast offering.

43:46.020 --> 43:48.740
The rest of these are lunch and dinner offering.

43:48.740 --> 43:50.860
Is this a chicken sandwich with bacon on it?

43:50.860 --> 43:55.420
Is this a hamburger with a fried chicken patty on it?

43:55.420 --> 43:56.940
No, very close though.

43:56.940 --> 43:59.620
The crunchy double is a double cheeseburger

43:59.620 --> 44:03.260
with six chicken McNuggets and barbecue sauce.

44:03.260 --> 44:04.140
Well, those are just going to fall

44:04.140 --> 44:05.220
all over the fucking place.

44:05.220 --> 44:07.300
Yeah, it should just be one patty.

44:07.300 --> 44:09.180
Next up is the surf and turf.

44:09.180 --> 44:10.020
Now, this one I know.

44:10.020 --> 44:12.600
This is Filet-O-Fish and a hamburger.

44:13.940 --> 44:16.220
That is correct, Travis.

44:16.220 --> 44:17.820
Well, no, it's incorrect.

44:17.820 --> 44:19.540
It's a double cheeseburger.

44:19.540 --> 44:20.380
Okay, whatever.

44:20.380 --> 44:22.020
Oh, that's a lot of patties then, huh?

44:22.020 --> 44:23.020
It's a lot of patties,

44:23.020 --> 44:24.940
but not as much as the land, air, and sea.

44:24.940 --> 44:26.540
Now, this one I also horrifyingly know.

44:26.540 --> 44:28.540
This is a double cheeseburger with Filet-O-Fish

44:28.540 --> 44:30.100
and a chicken patty.

44:31.140 --> 44:34.140
Well, no, it's a Big Mac with a McChicken and a Filet-O-Fish.

44:34.140 --> 44:35.380
You knew what I meant, Justin.

44:35.380 --> 44:36.500
No, Travis, you said a double.

44:36.500 --> 44:38.100
That would be four- The three menu items.

44:38.100 --> 44:40.660
If you want to see, look at this.

44:40.660 --> 44:42.620
Fuck, yes.

44:42.620 --> 44:43.460
Yes.

44:43.460 --> 44:45.860
Feed my family for a week.

44:45.860 --> 44:47.260
Yes.

44:47.260 --> 44:48.940
You said- Those are.

44:48.940 --> 44:50.940
I thought you said five offerings.

44:50.940 --> 44:52.020
No, just four.

44:52.020 --> 44:53.460
They're beautiful.

44:53.460 --> 44:54.300
They're beautiful.

44:54.300 --> 44:57.220
You can order them in the app and, ah, damn it.

44:58.420 --> 44:59.740
Justin bled too much.

44:59.740 --> 45:02.780
Are we in a new season or is there a new donut out?

45:02.780 --> 45:03.620
Hello, boys.

45:03.620 --> 45:04.460
It's donut-based.

45:04.460 --> 45:06.220
What a pleasure it is to be with you.

45:06.220 --> 45:07.060
Hi, there.

45:07.060 --> 45:10.220
Oh, there's blood everywhere here.

45:10.220 --> 45:11.060
Oh, God.

45:11.060 --> 45:11.900
Oh, I didn't even consider.

45:11.900 --> 45:12.860
I'm getting so incredibly hungry.

45:12.860 --> 45:15.060
Did you come from inside?

45:15.060 --> 45:15.900
Do you come from ins-

45:15.900 --> 45:17.220
Hold on, I must lick Justin's face.

45:17.220 --> 45:18.420
Do you eat blood?

45:18.420 --> 45:19.620
I thought you ate donuts.

45:19.620 --> 45:22.380
Is- I don't discriminate.

45:22.380 --> 45:23.220
They're two different things.

45:23.220 --> 45:24.580
Is donut just your name?

45:24.580 --> 45:25.580
Count donut.

45:25.580 --> 45:28.860
I love donuts aesthetically, but-

45:28.860 --> 45:30.140
Oh, okay.

45:30.140 --> 45:34.820
That which sustains you no longer sustains me.

45:34.820 --> 45:35.940
Oh, that's horrible.

45:35.940 --> 45:38.540
You love donuts, but you can't eat them.

45:38.540 --> 45:39.380
I could.

45:39.380 --> 45:40.820
Oh, you can eat them.

45:40.820 --> 45:41.740
I don't prefer-

45:41.740 --> 45:43.300
They make them very sick.

45:43.300 --> 45:44.140
Yeah.

45:45.500 --> 45:47.780
Like, I can eat donuts, but if I ate blood,

45:47.780 --> 45:49.580
I would get a big tummy ache.

45:49.580 --> 45:51.900
I have a gluten intolerance.

45:51.900 --> 45:52.940
Oh, no.

45:52.940 --> 45:54.020
Your only weakness.

45:55.780 --> 45:58.420
That's what makes this story so perfect for me.

45:58.420 --> 45:59.580
Okay.

45:59.580 --> 46:02.060
Krispy Kreme is of art.

46:02.060 --> 46:03.300
I'm Count Donut.

46:03.300 --> 46:05.100
If this is your first time listening,

46:05.100 --> 46:06.500
if this is their first time listening,

46:06.500 --> 46:07.900
they already turned it off, yeah.

46:07.900 --> 46:08.980
Yeah, they're gone.

46:08.980 --> 46:12.420
Krispy Kreme offers a free dozen

46:12.420 --> 46:15.140
to Red Cross blood donors.

46:15.140 --> 46:16.740
How sick.

46:16.740 --> 46:20.340
A dozen donuts if I just give away a little bit of blood?

46:20.340 --> 46:22.340
The American Red Cross is facing

46:22.340 --> 46:24.980
its worst blood shortage in over a decade,

46:24.980 --> 46:27.860
and Krispy Kreme has announced it will thank everyone

46:27.860 --> 46:32.860
who donates blood or platelets January 24th through 31st.

46:32.860 --> 46:36.540
This includes my favorite donation, Power Red.

46:36.540 --> 46:37.820
Do you know about this?

46:37.820 --> 46:39.140
Delicious.

46:39.140 --> 46:41.340
They just take out the blood and put back in the stuff

46:41.340 --> 46:42.180
they don't need.

46:42.180 --> 46:43.020
Fantastic.

46:43.020 --> 46:44.620
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:44.620 --> 46:48.540
Since then, severe weather has further complicated efforts

46:48.540 --> 46:51.740
to rebuild the Red Cross blood supply,

46:51.740 --> 46:54.140
including hundreds of blood drives

46:54.140 --> 46:56.300
canceled due to winter storms.

46:56.300 --> 46:59.540
Due to the severity of the shortage,

46:59.540 --> 47:02.700
the Red Cross continues to limit certain blood product

47:02.700 --> 47:05.820
distributions to hospitals, depending on current inventories,

47:05.820 --> 47:08.940
which seems like perhaps too much context

47:08.940 --> 47:12.180
for a news story about free donuts, but I digress.

47:14.020 --> 47:16.700
It's vital that donors continue to come forward

47:16.700 --> 47:18.700
in the days and weeks.

47:18.700 --> 47:19.540
And what's happening?

47:19.540 --> 47:24.540
Well, Dave Skinner, the Krispy Kreme CMO, is here to help.

47:24.780 --> 47:27.620
We're grateful for all that the American Red Cross

47:27.620 --> 47:30.380
does for our country, and we want to help them.

47:30.380 --> 47:33.980
Hopefully, a free original glazed dozen

47:33.980 --> 47:35.300
will increase awareness.

47:35.300 --> 47:38.140
Okay, you can't even spring for frosting, Dave.

47:38.140 --> 47:38.980
Okay.

47:38.980 --> 47:42.660
No, you don't get to pick, and you can't fight us for it

47:42.660 --> 47:44.940
because you're weak from blood loss.

47:44.940 --> 47:48.460
You will take what you are offered, you bloodless baby.

47:48.460 --> 47:51.700
If I give two pints, can I get sprinkles?

47:51.700 --> 47:55.940
If you give two pints, your only donut will be the grave.

47:55.940 --> 47:57.540
It'll be the grave.

47:57.540 --> 48:02.540
We're encouraging, oh, this is my, this is the good part.

48:02.620 --> 48:06.140
We're also encouraging all of our employees

48:06.140 --> 48:10.300
who can donate to do so, says Dave Skinner.

48:10.300 --> 48:14.260
So in case your employer, Krispy Kreme,

48:14.260 --> 48:16.260
has not offered you enough,

48:16.260 --> 48:18.980
as if the labor shortage was not dire enough,

48:18.980 --> 48:21.700
now this donut store is making its workers

48:21.700 --> 48:23.300
give their succulent blood.

48:23.300 --> 48:25.380
Do they also get the free dozen, though?

48:25.380 --> 48:26.340
Or is that like?

48:26.340 --> 48:27.620
This is a fantastic question.

48:27.620 --> 48:29.780
I assume every Krispy Kreme employee is at home

48:29.780 --> 48:32.580
with hundreds of donuts that will be inedible

48:32.580 --> 48:33.860
by the following morning.

48:35.740 --> 48:37.580
Cool, yeah, I don't see anything wrong

48:37.580 --> 48:38.820
with any of that stuff.

48:40.700 --> 48:43.340
People should go donate blood if they're able to.

48:43.340 --> 48:44.180
Do you?

48:44.180 --> 48:45.300
I mean, donuts are not, but.

48:45.300 --> 48:47.380
Well, well, well, go do the right thing.

48:47.380 --> 48:48.940
I'm Travis.

48:48.940 --> 48:51.940
But for real, though, I've got so much blood.

48:51.940 --> 48:53.060
And you know what I don't have?

48:53.060 --> 48:55.580
12 donuts now.

48:55.580 --> 48:57.220
Is it a, do you get a baker's dozen

48:57.220 --> 48:58.660
or is it just a dozen?

48:58.660 --> 48:59.900
Oh, this is an important question.

48:59.900 --> 49:00.940
Is this a one-time offer?

49:00.940 --> 49:03.180
Because I have a lot of pints saved up.

49:03.180 --> 49:04.020
Oh, yeah.

49:04.020 --> 49:06.700
That I could like turn in, like Pepsi points.

49:06.700 --> 49:09.700
Yes, turn in your Pepsi points.

49:09.700 --> 49:11.980
My Pepsi points of blood, my pint points.

49:11.980 --> 49:13.980
I never get cuts or scrapes

49:13.980 --> 49:17.620
because of the way that my incredibly sedentary lifestyle.

49:17.620 --> 49:21.340
So I must have, I must be like a tick.

49:21.340 --> 49:23.820
Like so much. Deeply engorged.

49:23.820 --> 49:25.700
So engorged.

49:25.700 --> 49:29.380
This is unfortunate timing in a way

49:29.380 --> 49:32.180
because Justin just gave blood last week.

49:32.180 --> 49:34.940
Are you able to like show the receipt and get it still?

49:34.940 --> 49:36.500
Yes, yes. Guys, hold on a sec.

49:36.500 --> 49:37.340
Hold on, sorry.

49:38.460 --> 49:41.500
The sound on my track is gonna be weird for a second.

49:41.500 --> 49:44.820
There's a parade outside on the street for Justin

49:44.820 --> 49:48.020
for giving blood and they're making a lot of noise.

49:48.020 --> 49:51.180
They're chanting, Justin, Justin, he gave blood.

49:51.180 --> 49:52.900
He's a good guy.

49:52.900 --> 49:55.420
Didn't even do it for donuts or nothing.

49:55.420 --> 49:58.180
Well, this is the problem that he now faces.

49:59.380 --> 50:02.380
If he redeems this offer,

50:02.380 --> 50:04.780
with the general sort of like body

50:04.780 --> 50:06.860
he's walking around the earth in,

50:06.860 --> 50:09.020
if he goes the Krispy Kreme,

50:09.020 --> 50:11.100
they are going to know two things immediately.

50:11.100 --> 50:15.860
One, this man drove an hour to get these free donuts.

50:15.860 --> 50:19.820
And two, this man gave his blood to get these donuts.

50:19.820 --> 50:22.100
What? What? What?

50:22.100 --> 50:24.500
How desperately does this man love Krispy Kremes?

50:24.500 --> 50:28.820
There's a cost in gas for your car to drive that far.

50:28.820 --> 50:32.660
And there's also a cost in body gas, which is blood.

50:32.660 --> 50:34.900
The gasoline for your body.

50:34.900 --> 50:36.220
Right.

50:36.220 --> 50:38.980
But anyway, if you are able to donate,

50:38.980 --> 50:41.500
please find a drive near you.

50:41.500 --> 50:46.300
Go to redcrossblood.org or 1-800-RED-CROSS.

50:46.300 --> 50:48.460
People need this delicious blood.

50:48.460 --> 50:50.060
There's something, something tells me

50:50.060 --> 50:51.380
that might've been a little more effective.

50:51.380 --> 50:53.060
I can tell from Justin's, he's a positive.

50:53.060 --> 50:54.540
Yeah, would have been more effective

50:54.540 --> 50:56.700
had it not been in Count Donut's voice,

50:56.700 --> 50:59.020
but a good message.

50:59.020 --> 51:01.500
I just like, it makes me feel relaxed

51:01.500 --> 51:03.780
knowing that there are buildings

51:03.780 --> 51:07.220
that hold oodles of free, delicious blood.

51:07.220 --> 51:08.860
Okay, this is why I'm saying

51:08.860 --> 51:11.500
that you might be kind of undermining,

51:11.500 --> 51:12.460
like, it's fine.

51:12.460 --> 51:13.460
It's great, yeah, do that.

51:13.460 --> 51:15.460
I just buy the blood types.

51:15.460 --> 51:18.060
I steal the blood types that nobody wants.

51:18.060 --> 51:19.500
The shitty ones.

51:19.500 --> 51:20.340
Like D.

51:20.340 --> 51:21.180
Yeah.

51:21.180 --> 51:24.500
If you have D, I steal the shit.

51:24.500 --> 51:26.140
Why is your blood so chunky?

51:26.140 --> 51:27.620
Oh, it's a...

51:27.620 --> 51:29.460
I love a chunky blood.

51:29.460 --> 51:30.340
Well, thanks Count Donut.

51:30.340 --> 51:33.620
This was the first sort of, I don't know,

51:33.620 --> 51:36.340
beneficial service you've ever provided, maybe.

51:36.340 --> 51:37.340
Who's Count Donut?

51:37.340 --> 51:39.460
Now, you know who Count Donut is, Justin.

51:39.460 --> 51:40.660
You know who Count Donut is.

51:40.660 --> 51:42.860
This is not part of the,

51:42.860 --> 51:44.260
is this a My Brother, My Brother, Me character?

51:44.260 --> 51:45.100
Because I don't know.

51:45.100 --> 51:46.540
You've never listened to...

51:46.540 --> 51:48.580
No, why would I listen to my own podcast?

51:48.580 --> 51:49.500
It's wild.

51:49.500 --> 51:51.060
Yeah.

51:51.060 --> 51:51.900
Yeah.

51:51.900 --> 51:54.100
Where'd all my blood go?

51:54.100 --> 51:55.740
Wait, does he drain it from the inside?

51:55.740 --> 51:57.780
I had no, I had piles of it surrounding me.

51:57.780 --> 51:58.900
Oh, what?

51:58.900 --> 52:01.300
Yeah, it's all gone.

52:01.300 --> 52:02.740
Didn't you just donate blood?

52:03.780 --> 52:05.140
Oh no, you know what?

52:05.140 --> 52:07.020
I didn't even think about this, Griffin.

52:07.020 --> 52:08.020
I did donate blood.

52:08.020 --> 52:09.500
Thank you for bringing that up, by the way.

52:09.500 --> 52:14.500
Not enough people have really celebrated me for that.

52:14.500 --> 52:17.180
I just wish there was a way

52:17.180 --> 52:18.660
that I could get free donuts out of it.

52:18.660 --> 52:20.620
That is what we need.

52:20.620 --> 52:23.100
You should wicked listen to our show sometime.

52:23.100 --> 52:23.940
Okay, yeah, I'll check it out.

52:23.940 --> 52:25.100
It's pretty funny sometimes.

52:25.100 --> 52:25.940
We do skits.

52:25.940 --> 52:28.340
Yeah, nice.

52:28.340 --> 52:29.180
How about another question?

52:29.180 --> 52:30.020
Yeah.

52:30.020 --> 52:30.860
Yeah.

52:30.860 --> 52:31.700
Yeah.

52:33.300 --> 52:35.020
I work for a funeral home.

52:35.020 --> 52:37.500
My boss expects me to hand out business cards.

52:37.500 --> 52:39.540
I would love to reach out to families that need us,

52:39.540 --> 52:41.780
but how on earth do I do this

52:41.780 --> 52:43.460
without looking like capitalist vulture?

52:43.460 --> 52:45.540
That's from embalming in the Emerald City.

52:45.540 --> 52:46.500
That's interesting.

52:46.500 --> 52:47.340
That's interesting.

52:47.340 --> 52:48.180
Speak on that.

52:49.180 --> 52:50.340
I guess they can't.

52:50.340 --> 52:51.860
No, they're not here.

52:51.860 --> 52:55.180
Yeah, that's not possible.

52:55.180 --> 52:56.060
I think you have to,

52:56.060 --> 52:58.580
your only option here is to be a pickpocket

52:58.580 --> 53:00.380
that can sort of slip these into people's.

53:00.380 --> 53:03.260
No, because that's terrifying.

53:03.260 --> 53:04.260
It's terrifying, right?

53:04.260 --> 53:05.540
I mean, it's beyond terrifying.

53:05.540 --> 53:06.380
That's worse.

53:06.380 --> 53:08.500
You have described the worst version of this.

53:08.500 --> 53:09.340
It's good.

53:09.340 --> 53:10.540
Now that we've found bottom,

53:10.540 --> 53:11.380
let's crawl up from here.

53:11.380 --> 53:14.260
The worst version is like you see someone,

53:14.260 --> 53:16.820
like a little kid playing chess with their peepaw

53:16.820 --> 53:18.660
in the park and you go over to the little kid

53:18.660 --> 53:21.140
and like, mm, peepaw, huh?

53:21.140 --> 53:22.380
Just keep this in mind.

53:22.380 --> 53:24.540
And you hand them a business card.

53:24.540 --> 53:25.860
Sorry, wait, stop.

53:25.860 --> 53:27.020
Hand the kid a business card?

53:27.020 --> 53:28.580
Yeah, that's the worst version.

53:28.580 --> 53:31.660
I'm saying that's the worst version of like,

53:31.660 --> 53:33.180
you do need to clarify for me

53:33.180 --> 53:35.420
if you are handing the card to the child.

53:35.420 --> 53:36.260
To the child.

53:36.260 --> 53:38.060
You are assuming we'll be the executor

53:38.060 --> 53:40.460
of Peepaw's Miss Fortune.

53:40.460 --> 53:42.340
Peepaw's not gonna do it, he's dead.

53:42.340 --> 53:43.180
Yeah, Peepaw.

53:43.180 --> 53:44.420
Yes, but.

53:44.420 --> 53:45.540
Okay.

53:45.540 --> 53:49.300
No one's playing with their own elderly father in the park.

53:49.300 --> 53:51.900
It's always grandchildren and peepaw, Justin.

53:51.900 --> 53:54.420
When was the last time you and dad sat down at the park

53:54.420 --> 53:56.740
to play a round of chess?

53:56.740 --> 53:59.340
This is the problem with funeral homes

53:59.340 --> 54:01.740
is that they only do that.

54:01.740 --> 54:02.580
You know?

54:03.860 --> 54:08.700
If I see a sign for a funeral home while I'm driving around,

54:08.700 --> 54:12.180
I'll avert my eyes, because I don't need it right now.

54:12.180 --> 54:13.020
You know what I mean?

54:13.020 --> 54:16.500
I don't need the anxiety, I don't need the existential,

54:16.500 --> 54:17.340
all that stuff.

54:17.340 --> 54:19.740
I just don't, whatever, it's bumming me out,

54:19.740 --> 54:20.580
I'm not gonna pay attention.

54:20.580 --> 54:23.940
But, if the sign said, embalming Aunt Fro-yo.

54:23.940 --> 54:25.260
Ooh.

54:25.260 --> 54:28.100
Then I might stop in

54:28.100 --> 54:29.620
and start to get a little bit more comfortable,

54:29.620 --> 54:33.740
work through these deeply American ideas

54:33.740 --> 54:35.940
about death and mortality and stuff like that.

54:35.940 --> 54:39.420
Cause like, oh, I know that place,

54:39.420 --> 54:41.020
that's where I get Fro-yo.

54:41.020 --> 54:42.700
So you can hand me a little business card and be like,

54:42.700 --> 54:44.260
you look like someone who's going to live

54:44.260 --> 54:47.940
a long natural life, but also enjoys Fro-yo.

54:47.940 --> 54:49.900
So why don't you hold onto this card?

54:49.900 --> 54:51.380
It's a punch card.

54:51.380 --> 54:53.180
And it does have the number for you.

54:53.180 --> 54:54.020
It does.

54:54.020 --> 54:54.860
I'll have some cases.

54:54.860 --> 54:55.700
That's just okay.

54:55.700 --> 54:57.940
But, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

54:57.940 --> 55:00.380
Can I take it and add a little spice?

55:00.380 --> 55:01.220
Add a little flavor?

55:01.220 --> 55:03.220
That's what you do, Travis, that's what you do here.

55:03.220 --> 55:05.340
That's why they call you the spice man.

55:05.340 --> 55:06.300
The spice, let's flip.

55:06.300 --> 55:09.460
Funeral home slash arcade, right?

55:09.460 --> 55:11.220
And you can turn in tickets.

55:11.220 --> 55:12.700
That's great for the kids too.

55:12.700 --> 55:14.540
Well, and here's the great thing about it, right?

55:14.540 --> 55:16.540
Funerals, ugh, so expensive, right?

55:16.540 --> 55:17.540
Big lump sum.

55:17.540 --> 55:22.540
But over time, I'm paying in quarters over like 20 years

55:22.540 --> 55:25.100
and then I can cash in those tickets.

55:25.100 --> 55:28.180
And it's like, oh, that very nice gasket?

55:28.180 --> 55:30.900
You're going to need 20,000 tickets for that.

55:30.900 --> 55:32.700
I don't think there should be,

55:32.700 --> 55:35.820
for my idea to be a good one, and we all know it is,

55:35.820 --> 55:37.820
I don't think there can be any connection

55:37.820 --> 55:39.460
between the two businesses.

55:39.460 --> 55:41.780
It's literally just about knowing,

55:41.780 --> 55:44.660
oh, that's the place, I do know of one funeral home,

55:44.660 --> 55:47.660
it's the place where I go to play spin to win

55:47.660 --> 55:50.060
and get giant inflatable teddy bears.

55:50.060 --> 55:51.100
You know what I mean?

55:51.100 --> 55:53.620
There's no connection between the two businesses.

55:53.620 --> 55:56.500
It's like how sometimes there's a Chili's 2

55:56.500 --> 55:58.060
inside an airport.

55:58.060 --> 55:59.940
No one would go to an airport

55:59.940 --> 56:01.380
if there weren't restaurants there.

56:01.380 --> 56:03.540
Well, I think they would

56:03.540 --> 56:06.420
because of the main function of an airport.

56:06.420 --> 56:07.980
But I see what you're saying.

56:07.980 --> 56:08.820
Listen.

56:08.820 --> 56:10.660
I don't know what they have against Southwest Egg Rolls.

56:10.660 --> 56:11.500
They're already there.

56:11.500 --> 56:16.500
It's Googling and Yelping places to go

56:17.020 --> 56:21.140
for a not bummer thing already kind of sucks, right?

56:21.140 --> 56:25.420
When it's like, oh, well, we have to go find a notary public

56:25.420 --> 56:29.180
or whatever, let's get on Yelp to find the right one.

56:29.180 --> 56:30.260
That sucks.

56:30.260 --> 56:32.100
Having to do that for, it's like, oh man,

56:32.100 --> 56:35.740
Peep's Paw beefed it.

56:35.740 --> 56:36.580
Who does good?

56:36.580 --> 56:40.020
Hey guys, who does good death parties?

56:40.020 --> 56:41.300
It's like, oh shit, I don't know.

56:41.300 --> 56:45.300
So maybe giving them a business card is upfront,

56:45.300 --> 56:47.060
pretty terrible.

56:47.060 --> 56:52.060
But when Peepo falls down that big hole and does pass away,

56:53.060 --> 56:55.260
to be able to be like, fuck.

56:55.260 --> 56:59.540
Well, at least we got this great recommendation

56:59.540 --> 57:00.700
on this business card.

57:00.700 --> 57:02.300
And we don't have to go around searching

57:02.300 --> 57:04.100
for who does the best dead parties

57:04.100 --> 57:06.700
because we know that they've got it on lockdown.

57:06.700 --> 57:08.340
Now, Griffin, you've made me think

57:08.340 --> 57:10.380
that it might be a branding issue.

57:10.380 --> 57:12.260
Funeral home, bummer.

57:12.260 --> 57:14.700
End game strategist.

57:14.700 --> 57:15.540
Awesome.

57:16.620 --> 57:17.860
I love that.

57:17.860 --> 57:20.220
This is what I'm saying because I don't want to go,

57:20.220 --> 57:22.900
oh, if I'm getting up there and it's like,

57:22.900 --> 57:23.860
I need to plan this shit out.

57:23.860 --> 57:25.500
I don't want to go to a funeral.

57:25.500 --> 57:29.060
But if I can do the Nintendo helpline of dying,

57:29.060 --> 57:30.300
fuck yeah, dude.

57:30.300 --> 57:31.580
I'm doing that.

57:31.580 --> 57:32.620
Encore.

57:32.620 --> 57:33.780
Ooh.

57:33.780 --> 57:34.620
Encore.

57:35.580 --> 57:37.100
One more number.

57:37.100 --> 57:38.460
One more performance.

57:38.460 --> 57:39.300
Encore.

57:39.300 --> 57:40.420
Ooh, I like that.

57:40.420 --> 57:42.100
Welcome to Curtain Call Embalming.

57:42.100 --> 57:43.980
Final countdown.

57:43.980 --> 57:46.740
Welcome to Curtain Call Embalming and Arcade.

57:46.740 --> 57:47.860
Ooh, I like that.

57:47.860 --> 57:48.700
That's good.

57:48.700 --> 57:49.540
Oh yeah, I like that.

57:49.540 --> 57:50.540
And you know what?

57:50.540 --> 57:53.900
We're looking to expand it into go-karts in the spring.

57:53.900 --> 57:56.340
Oh man, this would create a weird dynamic though

57:56.340 --> 57:59.420
for kids who aren't that close to their great grandparents,

57:59.420 --> 58:02.180
who like, we want them to live a nice, long, natural life.

58:02.180 --> 58:05.700
But do understand that when something does go wrong,

58:05.700 --> 58:09.060
they will get to go, they will get to go play skee-ball.

58:09.060 --> 58:10.620
Great pappy, great pappy.

58:10.620 --> 58:11.460
Just checking in.

58:11.460 --> 58:12.300
How are you feeling today?

58:12.300 --> 58:14.380
Because I did just get my allowance

58:14.380 --> 58:17.620
and I need to know if I should save it or not.

58:17.620 --> 58:18.460
Can I spend it?

58:18.460 --> 58:20.100
Are you going to be kicking another week?

58:20.100 --> 58:21.420
I wish nothing but the best for you.

58:21.420 --> 58:23.700
I'm just trying to do some financial planning here.

58:23.700 --> 58:25.500
And I do have a $10 bill

58:25.500 --> 58:27.820
and I need to know if I should save it for skee-ball

58:27.820 --> 58:29.580
or is it cool to go ahead?

58:29.580 --> 58:30.420
Oh, what?

58:30.420 --> 58:31.260
Did you just cough?

58:31.260 --> 58:32.740
Okay, I'm going to put that right here

58:32.740 --> 58:34.460
in the old banger roomie.

58:34.460 --> 58:37.060
Let me hit you with this, Funeral Home.

58:37.060 --> 58:42.060
And this one is just like outdoor celebration.

58:42.540 --> 58:47.540
Just kick my dead ass body down the hole raw and bury me.

58:47.620 --> 58:50.620
And then DJ Khaled is like, all right, let's fucking,

58:50.620 --> 58:52.420
let's get it started.

58:52.420 --> 58:53.940
And also Funnel Cakes.

58:53.940 --> 58:54.980
Funnel Cakes could be there.

58:54.980 --> 58:55.980
We all love Griffin.

58:55.980 --> 58:57.500
He did a great job.

58:57.500 --> 59:00.900
Here's a rebranding, Container Store.

59:00.900 --> 59:02.220
Okay.

59:02.220 --> 59:03.500
Okay.

59:03.500 --> 59:06.940
Like in the back room of the Container Store there is.

59:06.940 --> 59:09.980
Or Bed Bath and Beyond is also already right there.

59:09.980 --> 59:10.820
Way, way beyond.

59:10.820 --> 59:11.900
Yeah, that's fun.

59:11.900 --> 59:13.460
Bed Bath and the Great Beyond.

59:14.460 --> 59:15.860
All right, hey, thank you so much

59:15.860 --> 59:17.020
for listening to our podcast.

59:17.020 --> 59:18.940
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

59:18.940 --> 59:21.900
We are so thrilled to be here with you every week

59:21.900 --> 59:23.140
to share a little time with you.

59:23.140 --> 59:26.740
We're so flattered that you have made that choice yet again.

59:26.740 --> 59:29.060
If you enjoyed this week's show,

59:29.060 --> 59:30.500
and we almost never mentioned this,

59:30.500 --> 59:33.620
but it would be very helpful if you would like rate

59:33.620 --> 59:35.900
or review the show or, you know what?

59:35.900 --> 59:37.580
Just tell a friend like, hey,

59:37.580 --> 59:40.340
I know it seems overwhelming to get on board

59:40.340 --> 59:42.700
with the 595th.

59:43.740 --> 59:45.900
But this is when it's starting to get good.

59:45.900 --> 59:47.660
But it's just starting to get good.

59:49.220 --> 59:52.740
Hey, thanks to Montaigne for the use of our theme song.

59:52.740 --> 59:54.060
My life is better with you.

59:54.060 --> 59:55.180
And for everything.

59:55.180 --> 59:56.220
And for just everything.

59:56.220 --> 59:59.500
All of her incredible artistic contributions to humanity.

59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.100
Back in WW2, Montaigne saved me.

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:04.820
There was an army of tanks bearing down on me.

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:08.300
And out of nowhere, Montaigne came, shredded on a guitar,

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.180
and it sent out powerful sound waves

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.740
that cut the tanks in two.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:15.820
But also, it created peace.

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.260
We played soccer for a little bit.

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.380
All right.

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.100
Yeah, it was awesome.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.700
There's new merch out on Tuesday.

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.380
You can check that out at macromerch.com.

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:24.980
We got a brand new pen of the month.

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:29.220
It's Sawbone's number two books based on a recent episode.

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:31.100
I'll let you put all that together.

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.100
And that benefits the National Black Women's

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:34.460
Justice Institute.

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.580
They research, elevate, and educate the public

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.460
about innovative community-led solutions

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.620
to address the criminalization of black women and girls.

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:43.620
So a great cause.

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.460
And 20 rendezvous pens.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:48.500
We got two pens, one prom style of us,

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:51.540
and one of the three of us floating on a tandem bike.

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:52.980
You know, basic stuff.

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:55.180
They're available individually or as a pair.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.180
Those are designed by Lucas Hespenheide.

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:02.740
And that's at Moosley based on Twitter.

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:07.220
And we've got an I'm Not Ashamed of My Clown Husband sticker

01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:11.820
designed by Jacob Bailey at JSBailey817 on Twitter.

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.060
And that benefits the Huntington Children's Museum,

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.540
which is creating child-centered spaces that

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:20.020
promote exploration and a love for learning through play.

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:21.940
I also, man, if you like gaming,

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.940

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:28.060
on my Twitch page, twitch.tv slash the Travis McElroy.

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.100
I'm having fun.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:32.340
And surprisingly, I'm not terrible at it.

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.180
So come on over and check that out

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:35.580

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:40.580
where Griffin has been doing a Legend of Zelda run.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.300
Speak on that, Griffin.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.060
Oh, that's interesting.

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:44.900
Speak on that.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.580
I've been playing a randomized link to the past game

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.220
as Guy Fieri, but also I die in a single hit.

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:53.620
And it's been, I've been making slow but steady progress.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.620
I'm very proud of you for that.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:56.420
Justin, anything you want to promote?

01:01:58.500 --> 01:01:59.340
Nope. Nope.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.300
Okay. Empty Bowl.

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.140
No. Okay.

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.060
Empty Bowl is a meditative serial podcast

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:04.900
that Justin has- Stop.

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.100
No, I'll promote it. I'll promote it.

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.740
End of show. Okay.

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:09.300
It's a meditative podcast about the cereal.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:10.660
It's very relaxing. Okay.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:11.500
Griffin, bring us home, baby.

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.540
Yeah, it's from Yahoo! was sent in by Raj.

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:14.380
Thanks, Raj.

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.620
It's from Yahoo! answers user, Plippins,

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:20.420
who asks, do you,

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.980
this one was sent in by Raj.

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.620
It's asked by Plippins, who asks,

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:32.660
who's,

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:38.180
Quack, quack, quack.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.260
Where to, how?

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:43.580
So far, so good.

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:45.580
How?

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.140
That's one of the classics. Plippins, how?

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:48.460
That's one of the big ones.

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.420
Yeah, that's one of the main questions.

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:51.980
Why? Let's do a why.

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:56.420
Why is it, hey guys, it's me, Plippins.

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.400
Why is it that?

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.520
What is the?

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.140
Well, he tried what?

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:05.460
And that didn't seem to go anywhere either.

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:08.060
Why doesn't seem to be getting me there either?

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:10.660
Is this all what Plippins wrote?

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:11.500
Yeah.

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:16.500
Hey guys, it's me, Plippins.

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:24.820
I don't actually think I'm gonna get there this time, guys.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:27.520
And I don't know, no, no, no, I don't know what that means.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.860
Like, is this, do we?

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:30.100
Does the show not end?

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:33.540
I mean, is the show continuing after the file had stopped?

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:37.540
Griffin, try, I'm just gonna throw up the land before time.

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:38.940
Is that anything?

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.980
Hey guys, it's me, Plippins.

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:45.980
Do they make baby gas drops for big boys like me?

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:48.140
Plippins?

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:53.640
Hey guys, it's me, Plippins.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.980
If I take a lot of baby medicine,

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:58.380
does it count just as big boy medicine?

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.580
Thanks, it's me, Plippins.

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.620
I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis.

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.700
My brother and my brother make kids who dance grow the lips.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:11.860
I punish them precisely because the Evet Universe incident

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:14.260
is happening because I help keep my diet improvements.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:15.500
Hey, I'mLip 지.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.660
I'm from the Yes Universe area.

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:18.920
So, I have to learn a lesson in our community

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.860
and I'm planning to visit those places yourself.

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.940
Okay, this week, I'm going to meet this guy.

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.340
He was really somebody.

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:26.600
So, I've got to meet this guy today,

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:20.400
and he's a first grader who became a

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:24.420
Goiyori.

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:30.100
I can't wait to meet this guy because

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.720
I'm going up control of my Corona.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.520
And to get to know him, I'm going to make him

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:34.660
meet my big brother.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.480
And we're meeting the real dude,

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.480
It's a battle with you
