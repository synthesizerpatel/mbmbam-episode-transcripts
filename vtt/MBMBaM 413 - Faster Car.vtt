00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.840
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:47.840 --> 00:52.080
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.080 --> 00:56.480
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.480 --> 01:01.680
And folks, it's a special time of year for me. There's an event going on right now I'm very

01:01.680 --> 01:06.000
passionate about called Summer Games Sun Quick, where the whole video game speedrun community

01:06.000 --> 01:09.600
gets together and starts just burning these bad boys down. Crash is there, Sonic's there,

01:09.600 --> 01:14.000
Mario is not there, because he said too many cuss words last year. But I was thinking, Justin and

01:14.000 --> 01:18.720
Travis, this could be an exciting opportunity for us to sort of expand the brand, reach out to this

01:18.720 --> 01:24.560
thriving speedrun audience, and maybe we get into the scene, pick some stuff that we think we could

01:24.560 --> 01:31.120
really knock down the world records for, and climb that climb that time mountain. And what I thought

01:31.120 --> 01:36.080
I would start out with, and I would pitch it to you guys and see what you thought, is I'm gonna

01:36.080 --> 01:44.160
speedrun Boyhood. Okay, the movie? The Richard Linklater movie Boyhood. Okay. Okay. Because I

01:44.160 --> 01:50.240
watched it, and because I try to be a good Austin boy, and I watched all of it, and I just thought

01:50.240 --> 01:56.400
I could watch this so much. It's not optimized. I could get through this a lot faster. You watch

01:56.400 --> 02:01.840
the boy, and the boy learns like a lesson when he's a little boy, and there's, you know, there's

02:01.840 --> 02:06.960
so many shitty dads in that movie, and it's like I could easily find the skips to get past at least

02:06.960 --> 02:13.280
two or three of these shitty dads. And I'm working on this new strat where he doesn't go to college,

02:14.240 --> 02:19.600
and so that's, that's, I'm picking up some time there. Okay. I guess, Griffin, what I'm confused

02:19.600 --> 02:25.440
about is like you could just fast forward, or you could just like, it's a cheat. Skip scenes. No,

02:25.440 --> 02:30.560
fast forward is cheating, and everybody knows that, but if you can get the shitty second dad skip,

02:31.680 --> 02:38.480
and then get right to grown-up Patricia Arquette, then you get, you see the, you know, you get what's

02:38.480 --> 02:44.320
going on in the movie, but then the boy got really older, and you did it in less time. So I've been

02:44.320 --> 02:50.160
working on, I got the runtime down to like an hour five. The Japanese, yeah, the Japanese runner

02:50.160 --> 02:54.400
community for Boyhood has figured out some new clips. There's a part where you can make the boy

02:54.400 --> 02:59.440
go right through the wall of his house and get outside out of bounds, and then all of a sudden

02:59.440 --> 03:05.040
he's like 15 or so. Oh wow. Yeah, so I've been working on that, but it's, you know, it's like a

03:05.040 --> 03:08.960
picture. Are there any like warp whistles or anything? There is a warp whistle in Boyhood,

03:08.960 --> 03:12.800
Travis, and I'm so glad you asked. A lot of people miss out on it, but it's in the

03:12.800 --> 03:18.480
silverware drawer in the kitchen of the second house. How are you interacting with the scenes

03:18.480 --> 03:22.800
in this, in this sort of scenario that you've crafted here? This real scenario,

03:22.800 --> 03:27.040
or is it a touch thing? Is it a voice activation thing? How are you interacting with the film

03:27.040 --> 03:31.360
Boyhood? Is it like a click controller thing? Are you clicking your controller at the film Boyhood?

03:31.360 --> 03:37.360
With the click controller. Sort of like a Blu-ray, choose your own adventure sort of thing that was

03:37.360 --> 03:41.760
so hot for a while. I'm so glad that Travis brought up click because I do, I'm actually like

03:41.760 --> 03:47.120
third on the leaderboards for that one because in that one you can just make Adam Sandler press the

03:47.120 --> 03:53.680
go button way, way faster. And then like his kids, like they turn into skeleton bones, like from the

03:53.680 --> 03:58.240
Indiana Jones movie where the guy drinks the bad cup. And he gets really sad, but I get really

03:58.240 --> 04:02.880
happy because my fucking PB is like off the charts now. So it's not a hundred percent run,

04:02.880 --> 04:08.880
just to be clear. Any percent kids turn into skeleton bones run is the category there. But

04:08.880 --> 04:15.360
for Boyhood, it's mostly yelling at the boy to, you know, run through, clip through the wall.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.160
It's you, it's you running, yelling at the boy.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.360
Yeah. And then there is some screen touching, but that's mostly for me.

04:21.360 --> 04:27.360
Now I have been doing this with the Up series of films. Are y'all familiar with the Up series?

04:27.360 --> 04:29.120
Like the film Up?

04:29.120 --> 04:33.920
No, there, there was a documentary film series called the Up series. It started with Seven Up

04:33.920 --> 04:40.080
and then it was seven plus seven, 21 Up, 28 Up, 35 Up. They just, every seven years they check in

04:40.080 --> 04:44.560
on this series of kids. So they started out at seven and then every seven years they make another

04:44.560 --> 04:49.760
movie about these fools. Like, well, how are y'all doing? How's it going? I actually found a hack

04:49.760 --> 04:55.840
for this one, which is I just skipped a 49 Up because who gives a shit? This is now, you know

04:55.840 --> 05:01.920
what I mean? 56 Up, I got a new strat. 56 Up is coming out next year. I think I'm just going to

05:01.920 --> 05:07.280
skip to that one from now on. So I'm hoping to get my time down even quicker. I can skip straight to

05:07.280 --> 05:09.680
these fools being 56 years old. No problem.

05:09.680 --> 05:13.600
I, you know, I will actually say I've been doing this with Great British Bake Off

05:13.600 --> 05:16.880
because I'll start and you know, you'll watch a bunch of it. And then I realized like,

05:16.880 --> 05:19.120
I can just go to the store and buy a cake.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.320
Yeah.

05:20.320 --> 05:26.480
And like, when you do that, you kind of just like do it, right? Without having to watch each episode.

05:26.480 --> 05:30.400
Because really the whole reason you watch Great British Bake Off is so that you just get like,

05:30.400 --> 05:33.040
so fucking horny for baked goods.

05:33.040 --> 05:33.280
Yeah.

05:33.280 --> 05:37.920
And you have to like eat them. So just like cut out the middleman and just eat the baked goods.

05:38.720 --> 05:48.560
I had a memory last night of, I was watching GBBO last night with my wife and they,

05:48.560 --> 05:50.720
it was cakes. It was a cake episode.

05:51.440 --> 05:56.320
And I was thinking about it during the cake episode. I was remembering a time when I was

05:56.320 --> 06:02.720
in elementary school and I won a cake walk. And if you remember, I don't know if y'all,

06:02.720 --> 06:07.120
like that's, I think that's just, just a metaphor now for kids, kids these days.

06:07.120 --> 06:11.680
But a cake walk is like a bunch of people stand in like a circle and they call numbers,

06:11.680 --> 06:15.360
kind of like musical chairs. So one person ends up owning a cake.

06:15.360 --> 06:19.120
And at the end of this cake walk, I ended up owning a cake.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.360
As a child.

06:21.360 --> 06:27.120
As a child, I owned a cake and I can, I realized that I peaked.

06:27.120 --> 06:27.840
Yeah.

06:27.840 --> 06:35.040
Then the feeling I had of like, I own a cake. This is my cake and I own it.

06:35.040 --> 06:41.760
And I'm eight years old and I own this cake. I'm the owner of an entire cake that I own.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.040
I own this.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.920
Justin, isn't it weird to you that you accidentally did like crossover fan fiction

06:47.920 --> 06:51.600
of Great British Bake Off and boyhood? Like you have just described like,

06:52.240 --> 06:55.520
you like put in a cheat code for Justin McElroy boyhood,

06:56.240 --> 07:01.600
where like a Great British Bake Off cake appeared and eight-year-old Justin just had it.

07:01.600 --> 07:06.160
Welcome to 37 Up. We're checking back in with Justin McElroy.

07:06.160 --> 07:11.040
You'll remember in our past four films, Justin has just talked about the cake he won

07:11.040 --> 07:14.560
when he was eight. So let's check in and see how he's doing.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.400
Nope. Still the cake.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.120
Haven't topped it.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.320
Haven't beaten that.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.480
Love my kids. Love my wife.

07:20.480 --> 07:25.760
Love my kids. Love the wife. Got the house, the podcast, whatever. Can't beat the cake.

07:25.760 --> 07:30.400
Also, we're very sorry that we missed a couple of years there and had to do 37 Up.

07:30.400 --> 07:34.480
Some of these rascally kids were just hard to get a hold of this time.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.400
It is worth pointing out that I want to, it's not that,

07:38.400 --> 07:41.840
because Justin, if I may speak for you as your representative for a moment,

07:41.840 --> 07:46.560
I don't think it's that Justin doesn't love his kids and his wife more than a cake,

07:46.560 --> 07:56.640
but comparatively, eight-year-old Justin, a cake is like having eight wives and 16 kids.

07:56.640 --> 08:00.560
It's just the ca- Oh, that sounds so good, Trav.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.040
No, I think your metaphor fell apart a little bit there.

08:03.040 --> 08:03.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:03.920 --> 08:08.880
It was like being eight and owning an entire cake because it wasn't just,

08:08.880 --> 08:13.040
you have to remember that it wasn't just my ability to eat an entire cake if I want to.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.160
Of course, I was intoxicating. But think about the power.

08:16.160 --> 08:19.840
Think about the power that I had as an eight-year-old and owner of a cake.

08:19.840 --> 08:23.520
No one could take it from you because it was yours. You had not snatched this cake.

08:23.520 --> 08:26.640
It's extremely powerful. I'll never top it.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.680
How about a first question?

08:28.400 --> 08:34.400
I would love to answer a question and help people here on episode 413.

08:34.400 --> 08:38.480
Hey, we always say this at the end, but it's on my heart right now.

08:38.480 --> 08:44.160
Thank you to everybody who has listened to us blather on for 413 episodes.

08:44.160 --> 08:50.240
We appreciate you very much, and we so appreciate you sparing an hour of your time.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.840
413 is like so many.

08:51.840 --> 08:52.320
That's a lot.

08:53.120 --> 08:53.680
It's a lot.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.720
I'm so appreciative to all y'all.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.880
I work at a very fancy hotel.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.360
I'm a detective at a very fancy hotel.

09:04.560 --> 09:09.600
A new employee recently joined my team of hotel detectives,

09:09.600 --> 09:11.600
and in an effort to be friendly and helpful,

09:11.600 --> 09:14.640
I've been answering their questions about our policies and so on.

09:15.280 --> 09:19.440
However, in recent days, her questions have taken a different tone,

09:19.440 --> 09:23.280
pumping me for info on things like how late the security guards stay in the building,

09:23.840 --> 09:26.400
how many cameras are in the service corridors,

09:26.400 --> 09:29.440
if the codes for interdoors change regularly.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.120
How much trouble am I in?

09:31.120 --> 09:33.040
Should I alert the hotel authorities?

09:33.040 --> 09:35.040
Then again, I'm on minimum wage.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.720
Should I be asking to get in on the grift?

09:36.720 --> 09:38.160
Yup, yup, yup.

09:38.160 --> 09:42.400
That's from an unwilling extra in an Oceans movie in Dublin, Ireland.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.440
Okay, so listen.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.280
You are on the razor's edge right now.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.880
You are on the thinnest ice right now.

09:47.440 --> 09:52.000
What happens now makes or breaks the ice, I guess, that you're standing on,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.520
because you need to start very subtly laying down hints

09:55.520 --> 09:59.280
that you are down to clown until you're in the ground.

09:59.280 --> 10:02.800
And I'm talking about like this new employee walks into your office

10:02.800 --> 10:04.000
and is like, where are you?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.840
And then you climb out of the garbage can

10:05.840 --> 10:08.640
where you've folded yourself up to get in a real tiny place.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.400
And you're like, oh, sorry about that.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.280
Sometimes I fold up my body real small into real small shapes

10:13.280 --> 10:15.920
to climb into the garbage can because I'm so super flexible.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.680
But what was your questions?

10:17.680 --> 10:21.520
And maybe like when the employee's nearby,

10:21.520 --> 10:23.120
like in the break room or something,

10:23.120 --> 10:25.760
without even batting an eyelash,

10:25.760 --> 10:30.240
like steal a lunch from the refrigerator and say like,

10:30.240 --> 10:32.720
I don't even mind stealing things from people.

10:32.720 --> 10:33.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.160
Make it clear your morals are real flexible,

10:36.160 --> 10:37.520
as flexible as your body.

10:38.400 --> 10:42.480
You ruined it already by writing into us.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.960
You've just provided this.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.720
Do you realize this is probably the first episode

10:46.720 --> 10:47.600
of our Brother on Brother May?

10:47.600 --> 10:50.640
Where somewhere in the world, somewhere in time,

10:50.640 --> 10:54.160
a detective has just like pulled off their headphones

10:54.160 --> 10:56.880
and turned around at the corkboard they have with like pictures

10:56.880 --> 10:59.840
and thread tied between it like this is it.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.200
It all makes sense.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.040
The clues were here the entire time

11:03.040 --> 11:04.720
in this dumb, dumb podcast.

11:04.720 --> 11:05.040
You know what?

11:05.040 --> 11:07.760
In fact, just in case that this ever gets played

11:07.760 --> 11:10.240
as evidence in a courtroom, fart.

11:11.040 --> 11:11.840
Ah, nice.

11:11.840 --> 11:12.480
Got him.

11:12.480 --> 11:12.800
Got him.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.080
A big, a big ass.

11:17.360 --> 11:18.000
Do you hear that?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.280
Do you hear that, judge?

11:19.280 --> 11:21.120
A big ass fart.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.280
I present for the jury a big turd, a big juicy one.

11:28.080 --> 11:28.720
Assholes.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.240
I got a new exhibit.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.320
It's number 69.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.400
Yeah, I got an objection.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.400
I'd like to turn your attention to exhibit D.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.600
D's not.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.920
I got you all, you fucking courtroom dum-dums.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.960
Okay, this is more of a visual one,

11:44.960 --> 11:46.240
so you're gonna have to picture me here,

11:46.240 --> 11:49.360
but I have just walked up to the lawyer's briefcase

11:49.360 --> 11:51.120
and I've thrown all their papers in the air

11:51.120 --> 11:53.360
and I've said, these papers are out of order.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.360
Okay, but that's, you can't.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.760
But like, but you won't do that.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.880
Yeah, I picture it, but you won't.

11:58.880 --> 11:59.520
Somebody do it.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.120
Stenographer, stenographer.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.160
Flip those papers in the air.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.240
Those papers are out of order.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.000
I'm holding myself in contempt.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.560
And like, maybe hold yourself.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.440
Like, a hug.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.160
That's nice.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.920
Everybody give yourself a nice hug in the court.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.200
Yeah, you know what, jury?

12:13.760 --> 12:14.640
You're free to go.

12:14.640 --> 12:15.440
Hey, everybody.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.600
Everybody in the court.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.720
Oh, this is gonna be good.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.800
Everybody in the court.

12:20.800 --> 12:24.400
I'm evidence, so you have to do what I say, legally speaking.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.680
Everybody in the court, just like,

12:26.400 --> 12:29.040
let's just sort of close our eyes and bow our heads.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.600
It's sort of like, if you're into praying, that's cool,

12:31.600 --> 12:34.240
or just like, sort of make peace in the moment, right now.

12:34.240 --> 12:34.740
Okay.

12:35.760 --> 12:36.560
Run for it.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.000
Keep them close, everybody.

12:38.000 --> 12:38.640
Keep them close.

12:38.640 --> 12:39.680
Keep them close, everybody.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.360
When they really think it.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.800
Go, go, go, go, go.

12:42.800 --> 12:43.520
You're free.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.960
There's a car outside.

12:44.960 --> 12:45.680
It's Grixin.

12:45.680 --> 12:46.400
He's driving it.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.760
He's driving it forward slash donate.

12:47.760 --> 12:51.040
You just gotta go ahead and make sure you hit us back for this.

12:51.680 --> 12:52.480
With emeralds.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.000
We accept emeralds.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.280
Emeralds are fine.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.600
I'm sorry, but I've turned state's evidence.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.560
They've run out.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.600
They had it out of the court.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.320
Open your eyes.

13:00.320 --> 13:00.640
They're getting away.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.200
No, Travis.

13:01.200 --> 13:01.840
Travis, the emeralds.

13:01.840 --> 13:02.320
I'm sorry.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.200
It's too late.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.840
I had a lot of stuff I was trying to beat, and they said that they would let me off if

13:07.840 --> 13:08.720
I turned states.

13:08.720 --> 13:09.360
That's your deal.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.160
I get it.

13:10.160 --> 13:14.560
I, you know, this is a unique enough situation that I would like us to, you know, we've done

13:14.560 --> 13:16.720
a bunch of dumb stuff in the past few minutes.

13:17.280 --> 13:18.800
What would you do?

13:18.800 --> 13:26.560
Because like, this is kind of shady, but I'm not sure I would want to like confront the

13:26.560 --> 13:32.880
person about it because they might be the sort that, you know, some have a heart of

13:32.880 --> 13:33.680
gold.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.760
The only reason they say, like, they talk about some criminals have a heart of gold

13:38.320 --> 13:43.440
is to differentiate them from other criminals who most assuredly don't.

13:43.440 --> 13:43.840
Yeah.

13:43.840 --> 13:48.480
And I'm worried that like maybe you got one of the bad eggs that just cut you down.

13:48.480 --> 13:49.600
A heart of shit.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.560
It's possible.

13:50.560 --> 13:57.840
I have an idea here and a certain level of like deniability that might save your life

13:57.840 --> 14:05.920
while still foiling their plans, which is you then go ask those questions of somebody else,

14:06.480 --> 14:06.800
right?

14:06.800 --> 14:08.960
But in the exact same way they asked you.

14:09.760 --> 14:14.880
And now that person will report you and you say, like, well, they were asking about it

14:14.880 --> 14:17.600
and I didn't know the answer, so I was just trying to help them out.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.880
You've just increased the body count, Trav.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.280
Well, what if I ask 18 people?

14:23.280 --> 14:24.880
How many people can they take out?

14:24.880 --> 14:27.600
19, including you, because they could be a real dead pool.

14:28.880 --> 14:29.520
Oh, no.

14:29.520 --> 14:34.240
But at a certain point, maybe if I told like the chief of police and asked them.

14:34.240 --> 14:34.960
Oh, good, Trav.

14:34.960 --> 14:35.200
Yeah.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.440
No, they got a kid on the way, so that's great.

14:37.440 --> 14:37.760
Well done.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.200
Anybody else that you want to?

14:39.200 --> 14:39.700
Yeah.

14:40.560 --> 14:47.040
I think what I would do, gosh, this is a toughie because the two results of this, you seem

14:47.040 --> 14:49.360
like you're on the ball right now and that's good news.

14:49.360 --> 14:53.200
You can either join their crew and now it's Ocean's.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.920
I don't know how many people they got, but let's say like five because you've joined

14:57.920 --> 15:01.040
as the fifth member and you get to steal all the emeralds.

15:01.040 --> 15:06.480
Maybe it's the chaos emeralds that are kept inside your hotel and you get those and then

15:06.480 --> 15:08.640
you get a bunch of money and you get the thrill of doing that.

15:08.640 --> 15:15.360
The other thrill you could get, though, is being a crime buster like My Hero Deadpool.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.960
I'm just saying, I think either way this breaks, you're good.

15:18.960 --> 15:24.080
The only thing you can fuck this up with is if you do nothing.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.240
You bust out, you join them, one of the two.

15:26.880 --> 15:30.960
I will say, though, this might be a strong nothing move.

15:30.960 --> 15:35.360
Justin, ask me how late the security guards stay in the building.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.000
How late do the security guards stay in the building again?

15:38.000 --> 15:38.480
I don't know.

15:39.600 --> 15:40.800
Yeah, see, that's not good, Trav.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.480
That's kind of exactly what I just said.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.040
What does that do?

15:43.040 --> 15:43.680
Yeah, that doesn't do anything.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.600
But in doing that, you know what?

15:45.600 --> 15:48.880
That buck sails right over your head and on to the next person.

15:48.880 --> 15:49.520
It's fun.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.640
You didn't help the person and you didn't help the show, too.

15:52.640 --> 15:53.760
You did two.

15:53.760 --> 15:54.720
You failed twice at the same moment.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.400
I might have helped the person because it's a lot of pressure sometimes to say like you

15:58.400 --> 16:02.720
have to decide between either a life of crime or a life of detecting.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.680
But what about just like nothing?

16:05.680 --> 16:10.480
Hey, Trav, if you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.040
Mm, that was brilliant and rhythmic.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.160
Thank you.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.600
How about a Yahoo though?

16:15.600 --> 16:16.560
Yahoo.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.800
We have a lot of Yahoo's this week from people.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.360
Like they sent, I got the same Yahoo from a lot of folks.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.480
So thank you to everybody.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.840
It was a very good week for Yahoo's.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.680
A bunch of folks sent this one in.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.720
It's from Yahoo Answers user question mark.

16:29.760 --> 16:38.960
I'm gonna say Manny Ocean asks, is it blasphemy to say grace when eating food from Burger King?

16:38.960 --> 16:43.760
Just considering it's fast food and always wondered if religious people consider it a sin

16:43.760 --> 16:46.960
to thank God for the food when eating stuff like that.

16:46.960 --> 16:47.760
Just curious.

16:49.200 --> 16:53.920
So yeah, you're at the table of Burger King.

16:56.160 --> 17:00.720
Is the idea here that if God had interceded with his divine providence,

17:00.720 --> 17:04.080
that he would have served you up something better than BK?

17:04.080 --> 17:08.720
Or like you would pray and Jesus would be like, I'm not blessing that shit.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.520
Yeah, you're at the Burger King table and you're like,

17:11.520 --> 17:15.920
please bless these extremely salty, too crunchy fries

17:15.920 --> 17:22.320
and our four sloppy sloppy Baconator Juniors in your most heavenly highest name, I pray.

17:22.320 --> 17:23.920
And then, you know, God's in heaven.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.600
He's like, oh, hold on, I got a call.

17:25.600 --> 17:29.040
And then, you know, a hole forms in the cloud floor and he looks down it

17:29.680 --> 17:33.120
and pulls out his magnifying glass and he sees what you're all up to

17:33.120 --> 17:34.880
because you can see through the roofs of all buildings.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.800
Don't even try jerking off.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.200
And so he sees the Burger King and goes,

17:40.080 --> 17:43.280
um, no, no, I won't bless that one.

17:44.480 --> 17:48.160
Get at me next time, maybe next time hit up, you know,

17:48.160 --> 17:50.800
Steak and Shake or a more reputable burger establishment.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.280
I'll bless that.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.560
A Red Robin.

17:52.560 --> 17:53.680
A Red Robin.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.360
I'll shout out to a Red Robin.

17:55.360 --> 18:02.160
But the thing is, God and Jesus' love go where they're needed the most, right?

18:02.160 --> 18:03.600
Not to fucking Burger King, Justin.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.640
No, yeah, just not.

18:04.640 --> 18:10.480
If I'm in a fancy, read about a fancy like steakhouse or something,

18:11.520 --> 18:12.720
I don't need God's help.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.960
Jesus will fuck with a steakhouse.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.320
That's it.

18:16.320 --> 18:22.640
Yeah, so what Justin is suggesting is that your family's doing a big pray

18:22.640 --> 18:23.840
right before the prom.

18:25.040 --> 18:28.160
And they took you out to Ruth's Chris to get you like psyched up.

18:28.160 --> 18:31.120
And then, you know, God's like, uh, yeah.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.520
So, uh, I was thinking, oh, hold on, I got a call.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.960
And a hole opens up in the cloud floor.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.160
And he looks down with his magnifying glass.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.280
He sees you in the Ruth's Chris.

18:37.280 --> 18:41.920
And he sees just some just sizzling hunks just sitting on your platter

18:41.920 --> 18:47.040
covered in like a nice garlic herb butter that's just juicily dribbling over the side.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.840
It may be into like a tasty looking potato puree.

18:49.840 --> 18:50.880
And it just looks real nice.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.840
And he goes, you don't need my help on this one.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.000
This is already.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.320
I can't do anything to improve that.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.760
That's doing good already.

18:59.760 --> 19:00.960
You're at Ruth's Chris, baby.

19:00.960 --> 19:04.000
That's what I get.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.920
I just say that I feel like God's divine love and Jesus's amazing bounty.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.000
Well, like he helped the people that needed it the most, right?

19:15.680 --> 19:20.000
For whatsoever you do unto the least of these you've done unto myself, right?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.120
Like, I feel like that counts for Burger King as well.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.280
I feel like Jesus is in this Burger King.

19:25.280 --> 19:25.600
No.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.200
You know, Jesus is in the McDonald's.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.480
No, I think at most they send the Holy Spirit.

19:30.480 --> 19:31.520
At most.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.960
Yeah, to do their dirty work.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.920
That's easily like Farm Team.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.240
I have always wondered what the Holy Spirit has been doing.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.840
That would actually explain a lot.

19:40.640 --> 19:44.000
Can I posit one reason why they might not be big Burger King fans?

19:45.040 --> 19:45.360
Why?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.120
Idolatry.

19:47.120 --> 19:47.840
Okay.

19:47.840 --> 19:48.160
Yes.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.600
By worshiping the king?

19:49.600 --> 19:51.600
Yeah, everybody's worshiping the Burger King.

19:51.600 --> 19:55.200
The Burger King does make you bow to him before he sneaks up on you.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.360
And he has the very, very scary face and body.

19:57.360 --> 20:01.360
And he makes you bow and pray to him and accept him into your heart.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.240
And then he gives like the kids crowns.

20:04.240 --> 20:07.920
And now the kids think that there are these, you know, omnipotent God kings.

20:08.480 --> 20:15.280
And don't get me wrong, the big man's not a big fan of how nasty all of the fries and burgers are.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.080
But it's all the idolatry just running rampant.

20:19.120 --> 20:25.120
So the scenario you're suggesting is that you pray, a hole opens up in the roof of the Burger King.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.200
Jesus comes down and looks and peeks.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.080
And he's like, but what of your earthly God?

20:30.080 --> 20:31.760
What of your master, the Burger King?

20:32.320 --> 20:33.280
What of his blessing?

20:33.280 --> 20:36.400
Why do you need mine providence?

20:36.400 --> 20:39.360
You have your master that you've hitched yourself to.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.680
Yeah, enjoy your new God.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.640
Let's see how long this one lasts.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.840
Dear Burger King God, I'm having a hard time at school.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.280
Can you help me pass the test?

20:49.280 --> 20:52.640
Burger King God's not going to help you out with the test like Jesus can.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.960
Well, to be fair, Burger King God just shows up and hands you a burger and you're like,

20:56.960 --> 20:58.640
this is a test on salads.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.280
This is good.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.040
I mean, it's a test on neuroscience.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.960
I could use any help.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.400
No, just a burger again.

21:04.400 --> 21:04.800
Shoot.

21:04.800 --> 21:10.000
If the Son of Man is indeed the King of Kings,

21:10.880 --> 21:16.560
then you have to imagine that the Burger King does roll up to Jesus.

21:16.560 --> 21:20.240
In which case, all Burger King's actions are,

21:21.120 --> 21:22.640
I mean, according to the Bible,

21:22.640 --> 21:26.960
are the direct result of the orders of Jesus Christ.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.960
So what I'm saying is he's the King of Kings.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.960
That means he's Burger King's boss.

21:30.960 --> 21:35.120
So that means he is the one that Burger King is answering to

21:35.120 --> 21:37.360
when prophets aren't where they would like to be.

21:37.360 --> 21:40.400
When Burger King wanted to do a new fry formulation,

21:40.400 --> 21:43.840
he had to ask Jesus's permission because he's the King of Kings.

21:43.840 --> 21:46.240
He walks out of the corporate headquarters looking all dejected

21:46.240 --> 21:49.120
because McDonald's has beaten their pants up and down.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.440
And they're thinking we might have to close up shop

21:51.440 --> 21:52.960
because nobody wants the BK.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.400
But then what's that on the corner?

21:54.400 --> 21:56.400
It's a burning garbage can.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.040
And what's that?

21:57.040 --> 21:58.800
There's a voice coming from inside.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.480
Whoa, whoa, there's a burning garbage can.

22:00.480 --> 22:01.440
I'm very scared of that.

22:01.440 --> 22:04.240
But he hears the voice and it calms and soothes him as it says,

22:05.440 --> 22:06.640
chicken fries, dude.

22:06.640 --> 22:12.320
Justin, are you about to say that you would murder some Burger King right now?

22:12.880 --> 22:15.040
They got these new crispy pretzel chicken fries

22:15.040 --> 22:17.280
that I'm dying to try.

22:17.280 --> 22:20.080
Yeah, crispy pretzel coated chicken fries.

22:20.080 --> 22:22.560
Don't mind if I do.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.560
Also Burger King does have the best fries.

22:26.240 --> 22:30.240
Of fast food chains, the winner is Rally's slash Checkers.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.480
Well, but that's the US season curlies.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.760
That doesn't count.

22:33.760 --> 22:34.480
Incorrect.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.040
Season straight.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.880
What fucking podcast is this?

22:36.880 --> 22:37.520
Season curlies.

22:37.520 --> 22:42.400
It's actually, you guys are sort of infringing on my trademark podcast,

22:42.400 --> 22:43.040
MuchSquad.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.400
So I'll see you in court.

22:45.520 --> 22:46.640
Here's another question.

22:46.640 --> 22:50.080
A fellow student has taken it upon himself to start writing fan fiction

22:50.080 --> 22:53.040
about all of us in my honors class at university.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.600
I started actually reading them out of more of a curiosity.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.760
It's come to my attention that if I often handily say

22:57.760 --> 23:01.680
I enjoy something in class, it ends up becoming a major trait

23:01.680 --> 23:03.360
for my quote character.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.600
How do I explain to this kid there's more to me

23:05.600 --> 23:08.160
than liking Star Wars and escape room games

23:08.160 --> 23:10.640
without making things weirder than they already are?

23:10.640 --> 23:12.720
I have to take multiple courses with this guy

23:12.720 --> 23:14.160
and I'm afraid he's going to kill me off.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.720
Oh my god, this is beautiful.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.480
That's from Characterized in California.

23:18.480 --> 23:22.240
Can I tell you the weirdest thing to me about this question?

23:22.240 --> 23:24.960
We always jump in on these things and especially,

23:26.160 --> 23:28.320
it's never me because I just finished reading the question.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.920
I know, I had a time.

23:29.920 --> 23:33.680
Maybe people don't really think that we're taking the time

23:33.680 --> 23:35.040
to think this thing through.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.680
I want people to know that our advice is coming from

23:37.680 --> 23:38.880
a place of consideration.

23:38.880 --> 23:42.560
We've edited out probably several minutes of consideration

23:42.560 --> 23:46.000
before we just leap in and start answering the questions.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.040
It seems like the obvious solution right here

23:49.040 --> 23:51.920
is not blow up your spot because you don't want to get...

23:51.920 --> 23:54.160
This property this person's working on

23:54.160 --> 23:58.480
could end up being the new AAA summer blockbuster franchise.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.200
I'm talking about movies, I'm talking about graphic novels,

24:01.200 --> 24:04.480
I'm talking about HBO premium TV with dicks and everything.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.200
I mean, Shades of Grey was a Twilight fan fiction,

24:07.200 --> 24:11.040
so like my dad says was a Twitter feed

24:11.040 --> 24:13.600
and now it's a hit TV show with Bill Shatner.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.240
Exploding, exploding, always exploding that property.

24:16.240 --> 24:19.200
I mean, look at the cavemen were a Geico thing

24:19.200 --> 24:20.720
and now look at them, you know what I mean?

24:20.720 --> 24:23.280
They have their own sitcom probably still.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.160
Yeah, and then there's Shit My Caveman says

24:26.160 --> 24:30.080
where they did just the two properties were so hot.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.960
There was two broke cavemen, things they say shitty.

24:33.760 --> 24:36.400
Yeah, and there was things my dad shit.

24:37.440 --> 24:40.080
Things my dad shit, including a caveman

24:40.080 --> 24:42.000
in that episode William Shatner goes in the toilet

24:42.000 --> 24:43.280
and poops out a whole caveman.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.400
So anyway, you want to be careful here.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.720
You don't want to get written out of the story.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.120
You got to make yourself as interesting as possible.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.760
And I'm talking about you open up your JanSport one day

24:53.760 --> 24:56.880
and you start to pull out a very magical looking sword.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.240
But then you look around and notice

24:58.240 --> 25:00.080
that the author has seen you,

25:00.080 --> 25:01.440
you tuck that sword right back away,

25:01.440 --> 25:03.280
you don't make a big deal out of it.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.360
Now you got a sword in the book.

25:05.360 --> 25:08.880
Or maybe like you open a really dramatic seeming letter

25:08.880 --> 25:12.080
with like a big wax seal and you kind of gasp a little bit

25:12.080 --> 25:13.120
right next to this person.

25:13.120 --> 25:13.920
They're like, what?

25:13.920 --> 25:17.600
You say like, well, it turns out my great aunt died

25:17.600 --> 25:19.520
and she left me her spooky house,

25:19.520 --> 25:23.600
but I have to spend the night in it if I want to inherit it.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.200
That's really good too.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.560
Or you open it up and you say, whoa, I got into Hogwarts.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.120
I have spells, spell powers.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.880
Another person trying to buy my oil fields?

25:35.440 --> 25:37.200
Yeah, I mean, that one is going to go

25:37.200 --> 25:40.240
more of a sort of dramatic non Harry Potter route.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.280
I was trying to get that HP.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.760
Well, someone's trying to buy my magical oil fields.

25:45.760 --> 25:46.260
Yeah.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.320
But you don't need to, you can't say,

25:52.320 --> 25:53.600
well, for so many reasons,

25:53.600 --> 25:55.600
you can't say anything about it, right?

25:55.600 --> 25:56.560
That's not happening.

25:57.360 --> 26:00.960
I don't think the concern about making things weird,

26:00.960 --> 26:04.960
like that ship has sailed and it wasn't you that did it.

26:04.960 --> 26:07.120
It's done, it's weird already.

26:07.120 --> 26:10.160
You have to get weird to fix a weird situation.

26:10.160 --> 26:13.440
Okay, this is not good advice, but welcome to the show.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.920
Maybe just go to them like, hey, I read it, love it.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.040
I've got some notes.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.440
Got a few notes for you.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.520
What if my character was six foot five?

26:22.240 --> 26:24.080
Next time write this in a G doc.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.400
Let your boy get in there and comment a little bit.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.640
Kind of help shape this narrative.

26:28.640 --> 26:30.080
Oh, you should be careful though,

26:30.080 --> 26:33.440
because if they start to change things about your character,

26:33.440 --> 26:35.440
it might start to change you in real life.

26:35.440 --> 26:38.720
Yes, I was just about to say that strange fiction heat.

26:38.720 --> 26:39.680
Pagemaster.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.440
You come into school the next day

26:41.440 --> 26:42.960
and you're just sitting there in class,

26:42.960 --> 26:46.080
you're taking good notes and expanding your horizons of mind,

26:46.080 --> 26:49.680
and then you rip a big huge one.

26:49.680 --> 26:52.640
And then everybody in class then changes your name to,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.040
you know, the toot doctor,

26:57.040 --> 26:58.400
and then you go home and you're like,

26:58.400 --> 26:59.120
wow, that stunk.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.600
I'm gonna brighten my spirits up with some fan fiction about my life.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.920
And then you see that exact scenario,

27:03.920 --> 27:05.920
and it ends with like a little PS,

27:05.920 --> 27:07.040
like books do sometimes,

27:07.040 --> 27:09.760
where it says, PS, Toby, I got you, motherfucker.

27:14.560 --> 27:15.760
That's illegal.

27:15.760 --> 27:16.960
You gotta be careful.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.120
You gotta be careful.

27:19.120 --> 27:23.920
You don't know who has magic pens and or notebooks these days.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.040
Are you checking the publish date on this stuff, by the way?

27:27.040 --> 27:27.520
Oh, no.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.760
Are you checking the publish date, by the way?

27:29.760 --> 27:33.120
Are you making sure that You Liking Star Wars

27:33.120 --> 27:35.440
wasn't written before you told everybody

27:35.440 --> 27:37.840
how much you fucking love Star Wars?

27:37.840 --> 27:40.080
I didn't even used to care about Star Wars,

27:40.080 --> 27:41.440
so I love it now.

27:41.440 --> 27:42.480
When did this come out?

27:42.480 --> 27:43.360
June 6th.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.920
Well, that's 1885.

27:45.920 --> 27:50.640
Oh, what?

27:50.640 --> 27:52.560
I was always wondering why it's yellowed.

27:53.360 --> 27:54.080
Amazing.

27:54.080 --> 28:00.640
Doc Brown, you got my fucking number, dude.

28:00.640 --> 28:11.680
Let's take a break and get the money soon.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.600
I want to tell you all about Bowling Branch.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.680
Bowling Branch has the sheets.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.280
They have the comforters.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.480
They have the blankets.

28:20.480 --> 28:21.200
They have the towels.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.440
They got, if you need it soft,

28:23.440 --> 28:24.240
they're going to have it.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.160
And it's going to be pretty dang soft.

28:26.160 --> 28:27.600
You could be getting some more sleep,

28:27.600 --> 28:28.640
and not just more sleep,

28:28.640 --> 28:31.600
but really, really good sleep on the soft, soft sheets

28:31.600 --> 28:33.760
and blankets and everything else in Bowling Branch.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.080
You could probably sleep with the towels.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.400
They don't say to say that,

28:38.400 --> 28:40.080
but the towels are soft enough.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.040
And maybe if you do,

28:41.920 --> 28:43.040
and I don't want to be crude here

28:43.040 --> 28:44.000
because it's an ad for them.

28:44.000 --> 28:44.560
They paid for it,

28:44.560 --> 28:45.760
but they probably don't want me saying

28:45.760 --> 28:47.440
that if you do make a sticky mess

28:47.440 --> 28:49.200
and you have the towel there ready to go,

28:49.760 --> 28:51.840
then nobody's going to need to know about that one.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.760
But they make all their products from bedding to blankets

28:53.760 --> 28:56.000
with pure 100% cotton.

28:56.000 --> 28:56.880
Start out super soft,

28:56.880 --> 28:58.160
and they get even softer over time.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.920
They got thousands of five-star reviews.

28:59.920 --> 29:02.000
Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, and Fast Company

29:02.000 --> 29:03.360
are all talking about Bowling Branch,

29:03.360 --> 29:04.080

29:04.080 --> 29:05.200

29:24.640 --> 29:26.480
Wouldn't it be funny if they made you say,

29:26.480 --> 29:29.520
I slipped the sheet tongue twister,

29:29.520 --> 29:31.680
and if you got it wrong, you didn't get any money?

29:32.320 --> 29:32.800
For the ad?

29:32.800 --> 29:33.920
For the ad.

29:33.920 --> 29:34.560
But here's the problem,

29:34.560 --> 29:36.800
Griffin, you talk about all those sheets,

29:36.800 --> 29:38.240
and I'm still sleepy,

29:39.040 --> 29:41.920
and I don't have nothing to put my sheets on.

29:41.920 --> 29:42.880
Justin, what do I do?

29:43.840 --> 29:45.120
Well, good news, Travis.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.360
Here is bed.

29:47.360 --> 29:49.280
That's right, look behind you, it's a box.

29:49.280 --> 29:49.920
I know what you're thinking,

29:49.920 --> 29:51.360
there could never be a bed in there,

29:51.360 --> 29:52.960
but there is, it's a Casper.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.200
And all you have to do is cut the plastic

29:55.200 --> 29:58.960
and watch as that beautiful, beautiful mattress expands.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.000
Our listeners are invited to take advantage of Casper's-

30:02.000 --> 30:03.520
My box is full of worms.

30:03.520 --> 30:06.000
Why'd you send me a box full of worms, Justin?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.960
Travis got a bed, I just got like 80 worms.

30:08.960 --> 30:09.920
The worms are-

30:10.800 --> 30:11.760
Part of it.

30:11.760 --> 30:12.720
The worms are-

30:12.720 --> 30:17.760
Dude, that's pumpkins, anybody seen that shit?

30:17.760 --> 30:18.720
You seen this one?

30:19.280 --> 30:20.240
Google that, guys.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.760
Hey, listen, take it from your man, Jay.

30:23.760 --> 30:25.040
I'm not going to steer you wrong,

30:25.040 --> 30:26.320
you gotta see this skit.

30:29.280 --> 30:32.080
Forrest Gump's in it, he's wearing this wild suit,

30:32.080 --> 30:34.240
got pumpkins all over the dang thing,

30:34.240 --> 30:37.520
and he's just going absolutely hog wild

30:37.520 --> 30:39.680
with his two skeleton friends.

30:39.680 --> 30:45.280
You have to see this one, guys.

30:45.280 --> 30:48.960
It's a little bit spooky, but that makes it funnier in a way.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.720
I know you're worried it's a Halloween skit,

30:50.720 --> 30:52.720
but there's no killing in this skit.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.560
No killing or cursing.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.000
Any questions?

30:56.000 --> 30:57.520
Oh yeah, that's what I'm going to.

30:57.520 --> 30:58.160
It's good.

30:59.200 --> 31:03.360
This is, a lot of times our advertising company

31:03.360 --> 31:06.240
clips the ads out from the beginning to the end of the ad

31:06.240 --> 31:07.760
to send them to the advertiser,

31:07.760 --> 31:10.080
so I hope that they get all of this one.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.120
It is unbelievable.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.320
Griffin, I want you to read it.

31:48.880 --> 31:49.280
Are you sure?

31:49.920 --> 31:51.920
Hometown boy, I think you deserve this.

31:52.720 --> 31:54.880
No, I do not live in San Antonio though, right?

31:55.520 --> 31:57.280
You're confused because of the name?

31:57.280 --> 31:58.560
Please, Griffin, read the name.

31:59.280 --> 32:02.480
The name is Joshua Austin.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.480
Okay, so I can kind of understand.

32:04.480 --> 32:08.240
So Mbem Bambinos who live in the San Antonio area,

32:08.240 --> 32:10.960
there's a hyperlink that we desperately need you to go to.

32:10.960 --> 32:13.520
If you live in San Antonio and you listen to our podcast

32:13.520 --> 32:15.440
and I find out that you didn't go to this hyperlink,

32:15.440 --> 32:16.880
I will be so, so peeved.

32:17.760 --> 32:24.560
It's www.joshuaaustindds.com.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.760
Mbem Bambinos in the San Antonio area,

32:27.760 --> 32:29.520
you need a good, good dentist.

32:29.520 --> 32:33.200
Check out www.joshuaaustindds.com

32:33.200 --> 32:36.560
for a dentist that vibes it and keeps it tight.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.640
This is a dentist.

32:38.640 --> 32:42.640
This is a tooth doctor with tools and instruments

32:42.640 --> 32:45.120
and everything that's gonna get into that mouth

32:45.120 --> 32:46.240
close to the nerves

32:46.240 --> 32:48.720
and you're gonna know exactly what kind of fucking

32:48.720 --> 32:50.800
righteous alt comedy that they are into.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.480
Is there anything better than that?

32:52.480 --> 32:55.200
Let me tell you about Joshua Austin.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.640
Was his dad a dentist?

32:56.640 --> 32:57.360
He was.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.760
He was. You can't buy that sort of thing.

32:59.760 --> 33:02.560
You have to inherit this level of dentistry.

33:03.280 --> 33:06.880
Joshua Austin was named a super dentist by Texas Monthly

33:06.880 --> 33:12.320
in 2014, 2015, 2016, and that's all we know.

33:12.320 --> 33:15.440
So maybe last year didn't quite nail it down.

33:15.440 --> 33:16.240
A bit of a light year.

33:16.240 --> 33:19.280
A light year for super dentistry from Josh.

33:19.280 --> 33:21.360
That's why he needs you now more than ever.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.720
Oh, last year he won evil dentist.

33:24.720 --> 33:25.040
Evil dentist.

33:25.040 --> 33:26.000
But he's bringing it back.

33:26.000 --> 33:31.040
San Antonio's best evil dentist is Joshua Austin.

33:31.040 --> 33:31.920
Just catch him.

33:31.920 --> 33:33.440
Just some stuff I can say about Joshua

33:33.440 --> 33:35.600
just by looking at the JPEGs on his website.

33:35.600 --> 33:38.960
One, he does own a very powerful, handsome jacket

33:38.960 --> 33:42.160
and let me, yeah, I can confirm, a nice watch.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.520
I bet he takes that off though

33:43.520 --> 33:45.920
before he gets a knuckle deep in the chompers

33:45.920 --> 33:47.280
to find all the nasty holes

33:47.280 --> 33:49.360
that have the food tucked away inside of them.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.640
Other things I know about him.

33:50.640 --> 33:53.200
I mean, the smile, it's on point.

33:53.200 --> 33:58.400
It's radiating something and you're gonna like that.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.200
You're gonna see these teeth and know that you're in good mouth.

34:02.240 --> 34:06.720
So go to JoshuaAustinDDS.com now.

34:07.520 --> 34:11.760
I feel like Joshua has broken the seal now of dentists

34:12.560 --> 34:15.120
knowing that they can now get advertisements on our show.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.640
When are we gonna have the perfect

34:18.640 --> 34:20.800
all dentist promotional spot

34:20.800 --> 34:24.640
that's just us talking about some of our favorite dentists?

34:25.440 --> 34:28.640
I think we should do a special episode.

34:28.640 --> 34:30.400
Just for dentists?

34:30.400 --> 34:31.760
They all gotta pay though.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.200
They're all gonna pay.

34:33.840 --> 34:36.560
Oh, he's a human, he's a human dentist for humans, by the way.

34:36.560 --> 34:39.440
We didn't specify he's not for dogs and horses and stuff.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.160
I have a message for Katie

34:42.160 --> 34:44.800
and this message is from Neil

34:44.800 --> 34:48.000
and it says, this year in lieu of having an arrangement

34:48.000 --> 34:50.400
sent to your office, edible or otherwise,

34:50.400 --> 34:52.800
I have decided to send you birthday wishes

34:52.800 --> 34:54.960
via these fine McElroy gentlemen.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.120
I love you more and more each day

34:57.120 --> 35:00.960
and I look forward to spending the rest of my life with you.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.960
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.800
And I just wanna go ahead and get out in front of this

35:06.800 --> 35:10.960
and say that Katie's birthday was a month ago

35:10.960 --> 35:12.880
so Katie, you know, for the last month

35:12.880 --> 35:16.320
when Neil has been promising you something good's on the way,

35:16.880 --> 35:19.120
that's it, finally here.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.560
Hopefully my dog came through

35:20.560 --> 35:23.120
with just a backup edible arrangement.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.560
Gotta have an edible arrangement.

35:24.560 --> 35:26.880
You always gotta have one on hand, I think.

35:28.160 --> 35:31.680
Also, one more gentlemen we have here.

35:31.680 --> 35:34.560
This is for Jack from Tess.

35:35.840 --> 35:38.080
Happy, happy birthday, Jack.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.800
You are the best little brother who serves his country,

35:40.800 --> 35:45.120
family and friends so well and I'm so grateful for you.

35:45.120 --> 35:48.240
Introducing me to the McElroys was the best gift ever

35:48.240 --> 35:50.800
but hopefully this evens the score.

35:50.800 --> 35:54.720
Enjoy one of the brothers saying go Army, beat Navy

35:54.720 --> 35:56.240
and have the best day ever.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.840
Love and miss you.

35:57.840 --> 36:00.320
I just really wish they would stop making the Army

36:00.320 --> 36:01.840
and Navy fight each other.

36:01.840 --> 36:04.000
It seems so like super dangerous.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.760
It's so wasteful.

36:05.760 --> 36:07.760
Really, really disrespectful.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.040
We need them at their best.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.840
Also, one of them's on the land

36:11.840 --> 36:13.120
and one of them's on the ocean.

36:13.120 --> 36:13.600
That's what I'm saying!

36:13.600 --> 36:15.120
Like, where are they even fighting?

36:15.120 --> 36:16.160
Cause I guess they gotta go-

36:16.160 --> 36:17.120
Like an island?

36:17.120 --> 36:19.520
I think the only fair thing is we get all these folks

36:19.520 --> 36:21.280
in planes and make them do Air Force.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.880
So it's just sort of like a neutral level of experience

36:24.880 --> 36:26.480
but it's just, it seems like-

36:27.440 --> 36:27.600
Why?

36:27.600 --> 36:29.120
Let's get it together.

36:31.280 --> 36:34.560
Now, I know as a Max Fun listener, you love enamel pins

36:34.560 --> 36:37.680
but guess who were the first people to wear enamel pins?

36:37.680 --> 36:39.600
Everyone in Starfleet.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.840
We talk about him every week on our show,

36:41.840 --> 36:43.280
The Greatest Generation.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.520
Originally about Star Trek The Next Generation,

36:45.520 --> 36:47.280
now we're covering Deep Space Nine.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.200
The main thing we're trying to encourage you to do

36:49.200 --> 36:50.480
is listen to the show.

36:50.480 --> 36:54.000
Listen to the show and know that you are expanding

36:54.000 --> 36:57.040
the community of enamel pin wearing enthusiasts.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.920
You can only resist Big Pin for so long.

36:59.920 --> 37:03.920
So give yourself over to Big Pin and The Greatest Generation

37:03.920 --> 37:06.080
by subscribing and downloading right now.

37:06.080 --> 37:08.160
The Greatest Generation at MaximumFun.org

37:08.160 --> 37:09.760
or wherever you get your podcasts.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.600
Do you all want a yahoo from me to you?

37:13.600 --> 37:14.240
Yeah.

37:14.240 --> 37:16.000
This one was also sent in by a lot of people

37:16.000 --> 37:18.320
and I don't know if it's very rich, a rich vein,

37:18.320 --> 37:20.480
but it made me think of something

37:20.480 --> 37:22.320
that I thought merited discussion.

37:22.320 --> 37:23.680
Thank you to everybody who sent this one

37:23.680 --> 37:25.840
and it's by an anonymous user.

37:25.840 --> 37:29.760
I'm gonna call them Shonda asks,

37:31.440 --> 37:34.800
me and my friend both applied for the same job.

37:34.800 --> 37:37.200
He got the job, but I didn't.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.640
Can I sue Papa John's?

37:38.640 --> 37:42.000
Now, I know you're hoping that the job they applied for

37:42.640 --> 37:46.240
was at a Papa John's and not at like their local bank.

37:46.240 --> 37:49.680
And this person's fury has just blinded them

37:49.680 --> 37:52.640
and they wanna sue somebody in the first face they see

37:52.640 --> 37:53.360
as the Papa John.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.120
But no, they both applied for Papa John's

37:55.760 --> 37:58.160
and they ended up hiring him, but not me.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.080
I've never been so angry in my life.

38:00.080 --> 38:01.520
Can I sue Papa John's?

38:02.400 --> 38:02.900
Yeah.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.640
Listen, I'm not gonna lie.

38:06.640 --> 38:11.200
Listen, why do we fall, Mr. Bruce?

38:14.320 --> 38:16.640
Why do we fall, Mr. Bruce?

38:16.640 --> 38:17.440
So we can-

38:17.440 --> 38:19.280
Do you want us to continue quoting the movie?

38:19.280 --> 38:20.000
I don't know what we're doing.

38:20.000 --> 38:20.960
Yeah, give me the next line,

38:20.960 --> 38:22.640
because I don't know if it's something about-

38:22.640 --> 38:23.920
So we can get back this.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.760
So we can apply at Pizza Hut.

38:25.760 --> 38:28.720
So you can apply at Pizza Hut, Mr. Bruce, that's right.

38:28.720 --> 38:31.520
Now, I would much rather work at the Hut, by the way.

38:31.520 --> 38:32.800
If we're just being straight up,

38:32.800 --> 38:35.840
I'd much rather work at a Domino's.

38:35.840 --> 38:38.400
I wouldn't much rather work at a Pizza Hut.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.160
I would take a Little Caesars.

38:40.720 --> 38:43.520
Other than discriminatory hiring practices,

38:43.520 --> 38:45.520
which I think is defo-suable,

38:46.240 --> 38:48.480
I don't think you can sue just because you know

38:48.480 --> 38:51.840
your friend Tony is a dumb, like awful piece of shit

38:51.840 --> 38:55.600
and you rule and you're so much cooler than Tony

38:55.600 --> 38:57.680
and there's no way Tony should have gotten this job

38:57.680 --> 38:58.240
and not you.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.920
I don't know that that argument holds up in the court of law.

39:01.920 --> 39:07.920
What you need to do is when Tony gets sent out on a delivery,

39:08.720 --> 39:11.440
you need to meet him in the parking lot with your own pizza

39:12.000 --> 39:14.080
and you need to beat him to the house

39:14.080 --> 39:17.040
and then call Papa John, send him a selfie,

39:17.040 --> 39:19.760
say, this is me here at the house,

39:19.760 --> 39:22.080
five minutes before Tony's dumb ass

39:22.080 --> 39:23.760
has even finished fueling up his car,

39:23.760 --> 39:26.640
which he honestly should have done before he was on the clock.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.560
Anyway, you chose poorly.

39:29.120 --> 39:29.520
Bye.

39:29.520 --> 39:30.560
I'm very into that.

39:30.560 --> 39:31.520
Very snow crash.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.360
If you can be wearing like a black trench coat

39:33.360 --> 39:34.640
and like Matrix sunglasses

39:34.640 --> 39:37.040
and have a katana when you show up to the house

39:37.040 --> 39:38.480
and you're on like a cool motorcycle,

39:38.480 --> 39:40.160
like that's gonna do it for me.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.960
The thing that popped out to me for this question

39:42.960 --> 39:44.800
that I just had to float by you boys,

39:44.800 --> 39:46.480
had to show you this balloon I found,

39:48.000 --> 39:51.760
John Shatter or whatever his name is,

39:51.760 --> 39:54.000
the founder of Papa John's

39:54.000 --> 39:57.360
and the most fucking just oozing charisma,

39:57.360 --> 39:59.920
the most charismatic commercial man I've ever seen,

39:59.920 --> 40:04.720
I mean, he named his business Papa John's.

40:04.720 --> 40:09.600
Now, don't just jump in here.

40:10.480 --> 40:11.760
Really look at that balloon.

40:12.560 --> 40:13.600
His name is John.

40:14.560 --> 40:17.200
And he said, I'm gonna make pizza so good

40:18.320 --> 40:22.720
that everyone's gonna call me Papa, Papa.

40:22.720 --> 40:26.080
They're gonna, I like it when you call me Papa John

40:26.080 --> 40:28.800
because I'm making you do it

40:28.800 --> 40:30.240
every time you call my business

40:31.360 --> 40:32.960
and you say, is this Papa John's?

40:32.960 --> 40:35.680
And I'm wire tapped in and I'm like, oh, nice.

40:36.800 --> 40:37.680
Hi, I need to order.

40:37.680 --> 40:39.120
Think about what he was getting started.

40:39.920 --> 40:42.080
Hi, this is John.

40:42.080 --> 40:43.520
Well, I'd like to order a pizza.

40:43.520 --> 40:44.400
From who?

40:44.400 --> 40:45.200
From you, John.

40:46.720 --> 40:47.280
Gotta say it.

40:47.280 --> 40:48.880
From Papa John.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.360
Yeah, what do you want now?

40:52.400 --> 40:54.320
It's just unbelievable to me.

40:55.040 --> 40:55.920
Naming things is hard.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.120
I get it, I get it.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.360
But when we were naming this podcast,

41:00.000 --> 41:06.240
the name Daddy Griffin never even crossed my mind.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.120
It could have been cool

41:07.680 --> 41:09.680
if the podcast the three of us do

41:09.680 --> 41:10.960
and have been doing for eight years

41:10.960 --> 41:12.320
was just called Daddy Griffin.

41:12.880 --> 41:15.520
But it just seems strange to me.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.920
The name of my business is Papa.

41:19.920 --> 41:22.880
Nobody in his life had ever called him Papa John

41:22.880 --> 41:24.560
ever to that point, I bet.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.480
There's no way this was a nickname.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.800
And even if it was, it's a bit presumptuous

41:28.800 --> 41:30.640
to make your nickname the name of your pizza place.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.360
Anyway, you probably shouldn't sue.

41:33.360 --> 41:34.720
Yeah, I don't think you can sue.

41:35.280 --> 41:36.160
No, not sue.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.160
You're just gonna have to start a rival business

41:38.160 --> 41:39.760
and put them out of business.

41:39.760 --> 41:40.080
Yes.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.840
Daddy Tyler's pizza and things.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.040
Pizza and things.

41:47.600 --> 41:47.840
What?

41:47.840 --> 41:48.480
Oh, shit.

41:50.320 --> 41:51.600
So much food in this episode.

41:52.560 --> 41:54.480
It is a very food happy episode.

41:54.480 --> 41:57.040
I want a much squad.

41:59.040 --> 42:04.800
I want too much squad.

42:04.800 --> 42:08.880
Dunkin Donuts launches donut fries across America.

42:08.880 --> 42:10.640
Jesus Christ, Justin.

42:10.640 --> 42:12.880
You gotta give me some build up into it.

42:12.880 --> 42:15.600
You can't just fucking vert ramp off into it

42:15.600 --> 42:16.960
like right from the get go.

42:16.960 --> 42:21.120
Dunkin Donuts fries just ahead of the 4th of July holiday.

42:21.120 --> 42:24.240
Dunkin Donuts is bringing donut fries across America.

42:24.240 --> 42:29.600
What on earth could those two ideas have in common?

42:29.600 --> 42:32.880
What on earth are those two ideas overlapping with?

42:32.880 --> 42:36.560
Are America, I guess, following a successful test

42:36.560 --> 42:38.960
earlier this year, Dunkin Donuts announced-

42:38.960 --> 42:39.520
Yeah.

42:39.520 --> 42:41.120
We've done it.

42:41.120 --> 42:42.560
Listen, I know what you're thinking.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.520
We put the fucking scientific method to this one, okay?

42:45.520 --> 42:49.120
Dunkin Donuts announced it will now bring new donut fries

42:49.120 --> 42:51.280
to guests all throughout the country.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.360
Available for a limited time at-

42:53.360 --> 42:54.800
Listen, is it good or not?

42:54.800 --> 42:57.440
At participating Dunkin Donuts restaurants nationwide

42:57.440 --> 42:59.840
beginning Monday, July 2nd.

42:59.840 --> 43:04.240
This newest snack serves, I mean, it's what you think it is.

43:04.240 --> 43:06.880
It serves a sweet spin on classic fries,

43:06.880 --> 43:11.360
creating a fun, easy to eat way to enjoy the delight of donuts.

43:11.360 --> 43:11.840
What?

43:11.840 --> 43:14.080
So notoriously hard to eat this whole time

43:14.080 --> 43:16.000
while on the go any time of day.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.280
Donut fries feature individual pieces of delicious,

43:19.280 --> 43:22.720
buttery croissant-style donut dough

43:22.720 --> 43:25.920
that are tossed in cinnamon sugar and served warm

43:25.920 --> 43:27.920
with just the right amount of crisp.

43:27.920 --> 43:29.520
Okay, okay, okay.

43:29.520 --> 43:32.160
Does it come with frosting you can dip it in?

43:32.160 --> 43:33.680
Uh, no.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.680
What the fuck, guys?

43:35.680 --> 43:36.160
I know.

43:36.160 --> 43:37.360
We made donut pizza.

43:37.360 --> 43:38.880
Is there any kind of sauce or anything?

43:38.880 --> 43:41.200
No, it's just a big, round, flat donut.

43:41.200 --> 43:42.320
What the fuck, guys?

43:42.320 --> 43:44.560
You can't set yourself up like that and drop the ball.

43:44.560 --> 43:46.080
You can't set yourself up like that and drop the ball.

43:46.080 --> 43:47.920
They are gonna start having ketchup.

43:47.920 --> 43:51.120
Dunkin' Donuts tested donut fries at a small number of locations

43:51.120 --> 43:54.000
in the Boston and Providence markets earlier this year.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.520
According to Tony Wiseman,

43:55.520 --> 43:58.960
chief marketing officer of Dunkin' Donuts US,

43:58.960 --> 44:02.960
okay, as America's donut leader,

44:03.760 --> 44:07.120
we put our passion and creativity

44:07.120 --> 44:11.120
towards finding fun and unexpected ways

44:11.120 --> 44:15.520
to please and surprise donut fans.

44:15.520 --> 44:18.800
You're the leader of, if you're the leader of donuts,

44:18.800 --> 44:23.040
shouldn't you be operating with a modicum of responsibility?

44:23.040 --> 44:24.800
Shouldn't you at some point, like,

44:24.800 --> 44:27.600
try to blaze a trail for other donuts?

44:27.600 --> 44:30.880
At the very least, if you're trying to please donut fans,

44:30.880 --> 44:32.480
make fucking donuts.

44:32.480 --> 44:33.760
Make a good donut.

44:33.760 --> 44:36.880
Don't make these tiny donut sticks without dipping.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.720
I've never been, this is fucked up

44:38.720 --> 44:41.280
because I've never been so angry that this idea

44:41.280 --> 44:44.640
of the Munch Squad isn't nastier than it already is.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.000
You know what I mean?

44:46.000 --> 44:48.960
I will say I'm looking at a picture of these donut fries.

44:48.960 --> 44:51.040
They are not fry scale.

44:51.600 --> 44:54.480
They are like big hunks of donuts.

44:54.480 --> 44:56.480
They're donut sticks, which has been a thing forever.

44:57.520 --> 44:59.760
Listen, I need to finish this paragraph

44:59.760 --> 45:00.640
because I've never,

45:01.440 --> 45:04.080
we have a lot of fun with the English language here,

45:04.080 --> 45:05.760
the Munch Squad, this one's out there.

45:05.760 --> 45:08.560
There was a strong consumer response

45:08.560 --> 45:12.240
towards bringing donut fries to all Americans

45:12.240 --> 45:13.600
during the initial test.

45:14.400 --> 45:15.440
What?

45:15.440 --> 45:16.480
What does that mean?

45:16.480 --> 45:18.160
Hey, come again?

45:18.720 --> 45:20.560
There was a strong consumer response

45:20.560 --> 45:23.680
towards bringing donut fries to all Americans

45:23.680 --> 45:24.720
during the initial test.

45:24.720 --> 45:27.600
So what Tony is suggesting here

45:27.600 --> 45:31.120
is that some fine Bostonians went to their table,

45:31.120 --> 45:32.560
enjoyed their donut fries,

45:32.560 --> 45:34.960
then sprinted back up to the counter and was like,

45:34.960 --> 45:39.840
oh, oh, oh, you have to get this to everyone.

45:39.840 --> 45:41.360
Everyone deserves this.

45:41.360 --> 45:43.600
This, I can't just keep this for myself.

45:44.240 --> 45:46.160
Tony, I hate to point this out,

45:46.160 --> 45:48.480
but just saying a strong response,

45:48.480 --> 45:50.080
that could go either way.

45:50.080 --> 45:51.760
Yeah, that's how it hit me.

45:51.760 --> 45:54.080
It's like when you go into a bathroom,

45:54.080 --> 45:55.680
you smell a smell so bad that you need,

45:55.680 --> 45:58.160
you know, everyone in the country see the shining,

45:58.160 --> 46:00.000
shining seed and come in and smell it too.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.280
These are so nasty.

46:01.280 --> 46:02.560
I need everyone to eat them

46:02.560 --> 46:04.400
because they're not gonna believe me.

46:04.400 --> 46:06.560
Or like someone could take a bite and be like,

46:06.560 --> 46:08.080
you're gonna give these to everyone?

46:08.080 --> 46:09.120
You can't.

46:09.120 --> 46:11.040
Can't wait to see this.

46:11.040 --> 46:12.320
Don't do it.

46:12.320 --> 46:14.320
I'm having a strong response

46:14.320 --> 46:17.120
at the idea of you trying to give these to other people.

46:17.680 --> 46:19.440
I just real quick also wanna mention

46:19.440 --> 46:21.360
that Dunkin' Donuts, according to this press release,

46:21.360 --> 46:23.120
has a new shark bite donut.

46:23.120 --> 46:25.120
It's a feeding frenzy for donut fans

46:25.120 --> 46:27.440
who can now put their jaws around this new donut

46:27.440 --> 46:31.200
featuring white icing and special shark shaped sprinkles.

46:31.200 --> 46:35.760
I'm leading this American donut lover to ask why.

46:35.760 --> 46:40.400
Hey, wait, I heard the whole sentence.

46:41.200 --> 46:41.840
Why?

46:41.840 --> 46:43.200
Because what I heard from you is

46:43.760 --> 46:47.440
it's got white icing and special shark shaped sprinkles.

46:47.440 --> 46:48.720
What am I, four?

46:50.480 --> 46:50.800
Why?

46:50.800 --> 46:53.440
Why did you do that?

46:53.440 --> 46:54.880
Why did you do that?

46:55.440 --> 46:57.280
Why did you do the shark bite donut?

46:57.280 --> 46:58.240
I don't understand.

46:58.240 --> 47:02.000
I thought for sure the shark bite donut

47:02.000 --> 47:04.720
would just kind of be a hack where you walk up

47:04.720 --> 47:09.600
and you say, yeah, let me get the raspberry jelly filled.

47:09.600 --> 47:10.320
Just one of those.

47:10.320 --> 47:12.160
I just, you know, I want a little snack

47:12.160 --> 47:13.920
and my blood sugar's running a little low.

47:13.920 --> 47:15.600
Can I get that shark bite style?

47:15.600 --> 47:18.160
And the cashier says, oh yeah, sure.

47:18.160 --> 47:19.760
And they pick it up out of the counter and they go,

47:24.000 --> 47:26.640
and then they take a big old juicy jelly filled bite of that

47:26.640 --> 47:27.920
and just hand it right over.

47:27.920 --> 47:29.280
Oh no, the shark got it.

47:30.320 --> 47:32.000
I would not recommend finishing that.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.360
It is not very good.

47:33.360 --> 47:35.440
So anyway, that's your update.

47:35.440 --> 47:37.680
I just, the shark bite donut, why?

47:38.880 --> 47:39.840
I don't understand why.

47:39.840 --> 47:40.880
Why did it happen?

47:40.880 --> 47:41.280
Yeah.

47:41.280 --> 47:42.000
How about a yahoo?

47:42.000 --> 47:43.440
I got a lot of really good ones.

47:43.440 --> 47:44.640
Yeah, I guess.

47:44.640 --> 47:45.920
Well, is there a good question?

47:45.920 --> 47:46.960
No, it's not.

47:46.960 --> 47:48.560
Sorry, I'm kind of dejected.

47:48.560 --> 47:50.240
Also, I found a picture of a shark bite donut

47:50.240 --> 47:51.200
they did in 2014.

47:51.200 --> 47:52.320
It looks like a life preserver.

47:52.320 --> 47:53.040
That's the thing.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.080
No, it's kind of fun.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.440
But this is different now

47:55.440 --> 47:57.760
because it's just white with shark sprinkles on it.

47:57.760 --> 47:59.680
So is this just all the middles

47:59.680 --> 48:02.160
they have left over from the life preserver donuts?

48:02.160 --> 48:03.520
Presumably, yeah.

48:03.520 --> 48:06.720
Here is a yahoo sent in by Han Malik.

48:06.720 --> 48:07.280
Thank you, Han.

48:07.280 --> 48:10.160
It's yahoo answers user question mark.

48:10.160 --> 48:11.600
Jesus, Papa John asks,

48:13.600 --> 48:15.360
how can I stop YouTube from recommending

48:15.360 --> 48:16.960
Super Mario gaming for me?

48:17.680 --> 48:20.480
I hate Super Mario.

48:20.480 --> 48:21.360
And no matter what,

48:21.360 --> 48:23.600
I keep getting recommendation about these videos.

48:23.600 --> 48:26.080
I click dislike and say, not interested.

48:26.080 --> 48:27.360
I don't like the video.

48:27.360 --> 48:29.920
But I still get anything Super Mario

48:29.920 --> 48:31.120
on my recommended list.

48:32.880 --> 48:35.600
This happens to me on Netflix

48:36.160 --> 48:38.320
where everything I watch,

48:38.320 --> 48:39.520
Netflix is like,

48:39.520 --> 48:41.440
do you want to watch some Frasier now?

48:42.400 --> 48:44.240
And I'm like, why?

48:44.240 --> 48:47.840
We got lots of Frasier clips.

48:47.840 --> 48:49.440
Listen, here's the thing, right?

48:49.440 --> 48:51.200
I get it because I did just finish

48:51.200 --> 48:52.960
watching another episode of Frasier.

48:53.760 --> 48:55.840
And it's like, do you want to watch more Frasier?

48:55.840 --> 48:56.880
And I'm like, yes.

48:56.880 --> 48:59.600
But you were hate watching it

48:59.600 --> 49:00.720
and everybody knew it

49:00.720 --> 49:01.920
because you were laughing like,

49:01.920 --> 49:03.600
can you fucking believe this family?

49:03.600 --> 49:05.280
They're so out of touch.

49:05.280 --> 49:06.320
Well, and that's the thing is like,

49:06.320 --> 49:10.240
when I searched Netflix for like 90 sitcoms

49:10.240 --> 49:12.640
about radio psychologists,

49:12.640 --> 49:14.400
I wasn't looking for Frasier.

49:14.400 --> 49:15.520
And so then I was like,

49:15.520 --> 49:17.120
you think I want to watch this shit?

49:17.120 --> 49:19.280
And so I watched like 20 episodes of it

49:19.280 --> 49:21.040
just to prove Netflix wrong.

49:21.040 --> 49:24.080
Yeah, I hate the Plumber Mario.

49:24.080 --> 49:27.680
And yet somehow every time I get on YouTube

49:27.680 --> 49:29.280
to watch some of my favorite vids

49:30.160 --> 49:32.240
from some of my favorite vloggers,

49:32.240 --> 49:33.280
he's always there.

49:33.280 --> 49:35.680
And he always wants me to watch all of his videos.

49:35.680 --> 49:39.120
Maybe you could search out some videos

49:39.120 --> 49:43.040
of like Mario getting killed.

49:43.040 --> 49:43.840
You know what I mean?

49:43.840 --> 49:46.880
Like Mario catches a fireball right in his dick

49:47.520 --> 49:48.400
over and over again,

49:48.400 --> 49:50.640
like a super cut of Mario dying.

49:50.640 --> 49:52.160
And then YouTube will be like,

49:52.160 --> 49:53.440
oh, you hate Mario.

49:53.440 --> 49:55.520
Yeah, some of those super funny,

49:55.520 --> 49:59.120
like Newgrounds mid-90s Mario violence videos

49:59.120 --> 50:02.160
where like Mario and Luigi getting a big gun fight.

50:02.160 --> 50:04.560
And then it ends with like Mario dodging

50:04.560 --> 50:05.280
a bunch of his bullets.

50:05.280 --> 50:07.040
But then Luigi's right there and he's like,

50:07.040 --> 50:07.680
dodge this.

50:07.680 --> 50:09.360
And he shoots him right in the fucking face.

50:09.360 --> 50:12.080
And you're like, it's really fucking funny

50:12.080 --> 50:13.120
because it's Mario.

50:13.120 --> 50:14.320
Because it's 1996.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.800
And like, we're all still trying to figure it out.

50:17.760 --> 50:18.880
I like Mario.

50:20.080 --> 50:20.560
Okay.

50:20.560 --> 50:23.440
I mean, I'm just saying I find him pleasant.

50:23.440 --> 50:23.680
Yeah.

50:24.720 --> 50:28.480
These days, video games with their fast cars

50:28.480 --> 50:29.600
and their loud music

50:29.600 --> 50:31.920
and they keep having all these like punk characters.

50:32.880 --> 50:34.880
Have you guys played the fast car video game?

50:34.880 --> 50:39.840
The Tracy Chapman fast car game adaptation.

50:39.840 --> 50:42.320
It was unofficially in,

50:42.320 --> 50:44.480
it was the developers of Need for Speed.

50:44.480 --> 50:45.680
But they went ahead and they were like,

50:45.680 --> 50:47.920
we have a lot of fast cars.

50:47.920 --> 50:50.080
And they approached Tracy and were like,

50:50.080 --> 50:51.680
do you want us to just use some of these

50:51.680 --> 50:53.280
for the fast car game?

50:53.280 --> 50:54.800
And Tracy Chapman was like,

50:54.800 --> 50:55.760
yeah, I guess so.

50:55.760 --> 50:58.000
Seems like a weird fit.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.920
Have you all ever made a song video game before?

50:59.920 --> 51:00.560
You're like, well, no.

51:00.560 --> 51:03.040
Because there hasn't been a song called fast car before.

51:03.040 --> 51:05.520
And that's kind of like our whole thing.

51:07.360 --> 51:10.400
If you were going to make Tracy Chapman team racing

51:10.400 --> 51:11.600
and it's a car racer,

51:12.640 --> 51:14.960
always set to Tracy Chapman's fast car.

51:14.960 --> 51:18.640
But all Tracy Chapman's friends are in the game.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.400
Who would you put into like-

51:20.400 --> 51:21.600
Stephen Curtis.

51:21.600 --> 51:23.600
Sorry, you'd put Stephen Curtis Chapman

51:23.600 --> 51:25.120
in the Tracy Chapman racing game.

51:25.120 --> 51:26.560
You'd put contemporary Christian artist

51:26.560 --> 51:27.760
Stephen Curtis Chapman

51:27.760 --> 51:29.360
in the Tracy Chapman video game.

51:29.360 --> 51:30.480
I was going to say like,

51:31.360 --> 51:32.320
I would put-

51:32.320 --> 51:33.440
Tracy Allman.

51:33.440 --> 51:34.400
Desiree in there.

51:34.400 --> 51:36.000
Tracy Allman would be a great fit.

51:36.560 --> 51:38.800
I feel like Lisa Loeb would be an unlockable character.

51:38.800 --> 51:41.680
I feel like Lisa Loeb you'd be able to unlock for sure.

51:42.480 --> 51:44.880
And then like the whole game is,

51:44.880 --> 51:46.080
I think pretty short.

51:46.080 --> 51:47.440
Because you don't have to drive too far.

51:47.440 --> 51:49.280
You just got to cross the border into the city.

51:49.280 --> 51:51.760
And then if you win, you both get jobs

51:51.760 --> 51:54.080
and finally see what it means to be living.

51:54.080 --> 51:56.880
And you will know that that's like the final cut scene.

51:56.880 --> 52:00.880
And Tracy Chapman comes out and, you know, sings.

52:00.880 --> 52:02.880
I mean, it can't fit a lot on it

52:02.880 --> 52:05.120
because I'm imagining this is like a PlayStation 1 game.

52:05.120 --> 52:07.280
And so like the video quality is going to be really,

52:07.280 --> 52:11.360
like 140 pixels of just pure Tracy Chapman singing

52:11.360 --> 52:14.160
while a very fast car speeds into the background,

52:14.160 --> 52:16.480
picking up bonuses and power ups and stuff.

52:16.480 --> 52:18.080
Fuck, this would be a really good game.

52:18.080 --> 52:19.360
Did you not see Griffin?

52:19.360 --> 52:21.680
E3, there's a big release from Bethesda.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.840
I mean, it's not, it's going to be on the next gen console,

52:23.840 --> 52:24.960
but they're bringing it back.

52:24.960 --> 52:26.720
They're bringing back Fast Car 6?

52:26.720 --> 52:29.360
Yeah, this one, it takes,

52:29.360 --> 52:30.640
you can customize your car.

52:30.640 --> 52:32.400
You can customize your Tracy Chapman.

52:33.040 --> 52:35.120
Graphics still look pretty much the same.

52:36.240 --> 52:36.960
They didn't change.

52:36.960 --> 52:38.560
And the song is of course still the same.

52:39.920 --> 52:43.280
But story seems a lot more beefed up.

52:43.280 --> 52:45.280
You know, when's Tracy Chapman going to come out

52:45.280 --> 52:48.320
with a new fast car, right?

52:48.320 --> 52:51.760
Faster car, faster car.

52:51.760 --> 52:54.000
It kicks the ass of that last car.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.600
We thought that car was fast,

52:55.600 --> 52:59.120
but this one's so fucking fast.

52:59.120 --> 53:01.360
You won't believe how fast this one is.

53:01.360 --> 53:03.600
You're going to shit your pants

53:03.600 --> 53:06.320
when you see how fast a faster car goes.

53:06.320 --> 53:08.000
We got to make a decision.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.640
Take that slow dumb car, this new faster one.

53:10.640 --> 53:11.840
It's not a decision.

53:12.480 --> 53:14.480
This one's so much faster, idiot.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.680
It's got a Hemi.

53:16.240 --> 53:17.360
I think that's important.

53:17.360 --> 53:18.800
I don't know, but I paid extra.

53:18.800 --> 53:20.400
Got that nitrous.

53:20.400 --> 53:21.440
Does it have nitrous?

53:21.440 --> 53:22.560
What a dumb question.

53:22.560 --> 53:23.840
Of course it does.

53:24.400 --> 53:24.960
Press the button.

53:24.960 --> 53:28.160
Let's get the fuck out of here and rob a bank.

53:28.160 --> 53:29.040
Rob a bank.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.480
Rob 80 banks and crush a bank.

53:30.480 --> 53:31.840
We got to get baby driver.

53:33.280 --> 53:34.800
Drive this car so fast.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.680
Drive this car off a building.

53:39.680 --> 53:41.680
Drive it straight into another building.

53:41.680 --> 53:47.280
I, I, I, my car just transformed into a robot.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.800
Didn't I mention it does that?

53:50.800 --> 53:51.840
It does that.

53:51.840 --> 53:52.800
It does that.

53:52.800 --> 53:56.800
The rock just punched a torpedo into a slower car,

53:56.800 --> 53:58.560
but that's okay.

53:58.560 --> 54:00.640
That car was so unlike a faster car.

54:07.360 --> 54:09.440
Somebody get Tracy on the phone.

54:09.440 --> 54:12.720
You know that new song you've been looking for?

54:12.720 --> 54:13.760
Listen to this.

54:13.760 --> 54:16.000
Why didn't I ever think of faster car?

54:16.720 --> 54:17.520
Of course.

54:18.240 --> 54:19.200
Coming soon.

54:19.200 --> 54:20.480
Fastest car.

54:20.480 --> 54:26.000
Oh man, let's really take, we've had a long time to enjoy fast car.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.800
I don't want to just skip right over faster car.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.240
Faster car is really good.

54:30.800 --> 54:32.160
Folks, that's going to do it for us.

54:32.160 --> 54:35.040
Thank you so much for listening to our comedy podcast.

54:35.040 --> 54:38.800
Uh, we hope you have enjoyed yourself.

54:38.800 --> 54:42.240
Um, we, uh, do we have anything we need?

54:42.240 --> 54:47.840
I don't think, oh, I, we wrote a book, um, my wife and I, it's called Sawbones.

54:47.840 --> 54:53.600
It's coming out October 9th and you can pre-order that bit.ly forward slash Sawbones book.

54:53.600 --> 54:56.960
It's about medical history, just like our podcast is the same name.

54:56.960 --> 55:02.320
There's also a, an Adventure Zone graphic novel that's coming out so soon, less than a month.

55:02.320 --> 55:10.320
Just a few short weeks away, you can go to TheAdventureZoneComic.com and pre-order that.

55:10.320 --> 55:14.800
And if you would pre-order both those books, we'd sure appreciate it.

56:07.200 --> 56:09.120
instead of part drop the album, putting the days to bed.

It's a great album that you should definitely just, you know, have on you at all times,

56:13.680 --> 56:14.320

It's Yahoo Answers User.

56:41.040 --> 56:42.240
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

56:43.040 --> 56:44.080
So that's what?

56:44.080 --> 56:45.040
4 for 4?

56:45.040 --> 56:46.800
This being the worst fucking website ever.

56:47.360 --> 56:51.120
Uh, this one is asked by Tavis.

56:51.840 --> 56:56.080
This one's asked by Tavis who asks,

56:56.080 --> 56:59.760
Does Mr. Peanut need that monocle?

56:59.760 --> 57:01.520
Or is it just a fashion statement?

57:04.800 --> 57:06.480
My name is Justin McElroy.

57:06.480 --> 57:07.760
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:09.440 --> 57:11.760
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

57:11.760 --> 57:30.960

Welcome everyone to the live wrestling spectacular in Los Angeles.

57:40.560 --> 57:45.360
So far, the world's most boring wrestling podcast has been destroying the competition.

57:45.360 --> 57:49.120
Isn't there anyone who can save us from this travesty?

57:49.920 --> 57:51.760
Wait, could it be?

57:51.760 --> 57:54.640
It's Tights and Fights, the perfect wrestling podcast.

57:56.080 --> 58:00.720
Tights and Fights is here to save us from the monotony of boring wrestling podcasts

58:00.720 --> 58:02.320
with hilarious conversations.

58:02.320 --> 58:06.800
Woke trips through the history of wrestling.

58:06.800 --> 58:10.320
And joke about the finer points of people wearing spandex.

58:15.200 --> 58:16.320
What a match!

58:16.320 --> 58:19.200
And the Tights and Fights podcast will be back every week.

58:19.200 --> 58:23.600
