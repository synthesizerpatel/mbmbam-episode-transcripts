00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.840
Hello everybody and welcome to another My Brother, Mean Advice show for the modern era.

00:47.840 --> 00:54.160
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis of McElroy.

00:54.160 --> 00:59.120
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin, and we're doing it.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.960
Yeah, baby. This is the recording,

01:00.960 --> 01:04.480
we're doing it. I have something, an update of sorts.

01:06.320 --> 01:10.160
She's already the fastest woman alive, fastest person alive, frankly.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.720
Fastest being alive? I don't know, I think it's she that's probably-

01:12.720 --> 01:17.040
But Britney Spears, as we have established, is the fastest human being alive.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.520
Just kind of leaning into it a little bit for my taste, but okay.

01:21.520 --> 01:26.320
Well, she's, I mean, since she established it, she has been using it to save people from,

01:26.320 --> 01:33.200
you know, from dangerous situations. And she just yesterday was doing a live stream from her home,

01:34.240 --> 01:38.960
from her home gym, and just casually, casually mentioned,

01:38.960 --> 01:44.400
I haven't been in my home gym for about six months because it burned down.

01:44.400 --> 01:48.800
There were two candles in there, and yeah, one thing led to another.

01:50.560 --> 01:54.160
Yeah, you're really deep in the Britneyverse, Trav.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.920
Listen, you know-

01:55.920 --> 02:00.320
I was not expecting to return here on this show,

02:00.320 --> 02:05.760
because typically whenever something funny or goofy or zany happens in the world,

02:05.760 --> 02:09.760
we'll wring the juice out of it and then we'll move on.

02:09.760 --> 02:13.760
But I didn't expect you to kind of get off at Britney Station

02:14.320 --> 02:17.040
and spend some time holidaying there.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.680
You know, Griffin, a lot of people during this time,

02:19.680 --> 02:21.920
the last few months, have found a lot of new hobbies.

02:21.920 --> 02:26.400
You know, for some people, they've taken up the ukulele or perhaps knitting.

02:26.400 --> 02:30.720
And for me, it's a fascination with Ms. Spears.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.520
So Britney's doing okay. Sounds like she's hanging in there.

02:33.520 --> 02:37.280
Well, she rebuilt her home gym, I assume with her own two hands.

02:39.840 --> 02:43.280
She actually built it better than Bob Vila and faster than Bob Vila.

02:43.280 --> 02:47.120
Well, it's kind of like in The Batman Begins.

02:47.120 --> 02:51.600
It's like in Batman Begins, he said, beginning a sentence that I cannot wait to hear.

02:51.600 --> 02:56.960
You know, at first, Bruce Wayne's like, I want to tear down Wayne Manor.

02:56.960 --> 02:57.600
I hate it here.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.680
And then Ra's al Ghul burns it down much like two candles

03:01.680 --> 03:04.320
burned down Britney Spears' home gym.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.000
And then she was like, you know what?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.480
I'm going to rebuild it brick by brick.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.600
And then she also put a Batcave in the basement, I assume.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.800
It's just, what have we turned?

03:14.800 --> 03:18.800
This is one of those moments where it sinks in like, damn, shit's different.

03:19.520 --> 03:20.560
You know what I mean?

03:20.560 --> 03:21.360
Yeah.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.560
This is what it took.

03:22.560 --> 03:22.960
Hold on.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.880
This is what it took for that to sink in, Griffin?

03:24.880 --> 03:29.760
Me covering Britney Spears for a second time out of 509 episodes?

03:29.760 --> 03:30.240
It's not.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.880
I think it's just doing sort of news.

03:32.880 --> 03:33.440
You know what I mean?

03:33.440 --> 03:34.960
The breaking headlines.

03:34.960 --> 03:39.440
It's touching the vein of just like, here's a thing that's happening right now.

03:39.440 --> 03:43.040
Usually when we do the intro, it's most of the time something like,

03:44.720 --> 03:47.920
hey, everyone, this movie's coming out and that's funny

03:47.920 --> 03:51.440
because we're too cool to care about it.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.600
And people laugh because they're like, they're talking about Avengers,

03:53.600 --> 03:55.680
but they're too cool to care about that nerd shit.

03:56.800 --> 04:01.680
Or sometimes it'll be like one of us has turned into another character or another creature.

04:02.640 --> 04:08.480
And hearing you talk about this Britney stuff that you saw online,

04:08.480 --> 04:10.960
it feels, I don't know, it just feels different, man.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.720
It feels like you've changed, man.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.920
Maybe this is going to be like my model trains, you know?

04:15.920 --> 04:19.920
Like that thing of like, oh, I never thought Travis would, you know,

04:19.920 --> 04:22.800
get into painting toy soldiers or whatever.

04:22.800 --> 04:23.760
You know what I mean?

04:23.760 --> 04:25.280
This is my thing.

04:25.280 --> 04:28.080
I'm going to have a room in the attic that the kids aren't allowed to touch.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.680
And it's where I keep my Britney Spears conspiracy wall.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.920
I was hoping to spin.

04:33.920 --> 04:39.280
I had it penciled in this week's intro to talk about the theatrical release of Scoob.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.120
And I, of course, have been denied that.

04:44.640 --> 04:45.280
Good news.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.360
Damn, I would have loved to hear that one, Juice.

04:47.360 --> 04:47.760
I know.

04:47.760 --> 04:48.400
Fuck.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.440
I had it penciled in.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.200
Remember to talk about Scoob!

04:51.200 --> 04:53.680
Can we start over Scoob watch?

04:53.680 --> 04:54.720
Can you include it?

04:55.280 --> 05:00.160
Here's the headline with new rule exemption.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.560
Scoob assured Oscar eligibility.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.360
That is a relief for me.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.320
So Scoob's coming May 15th.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.280
That should fix it.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.760
Got a good cast for that, though.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.120
I don't know what it is.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.080
Scoob!

05:18.080 --> 05:18.580
Okay.

05:19.120 --> 05:22.320
I mean, I'm guessing it has to do with the Scooby Doo.

05:22.320 --> 05:26.000
Yeah, it's Scooby Doo before, in the before times.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.360
There's a thing I love in trailers where they're like,

05:31.360 --> 05:35.440
every hero has a story and every story has a beginning.

05:35.440 --> 05:38.000
And this is our beginning and it's Scoob.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.560
And it's when they first fell in love with Shaggy and Scooby.

05:42.560 --> 05:43.840
Shaggy, what?

05:43.840 --> 05:45.360
When Shaggy and Scooby fell in love?

05:46.400 --> 05:47.920
No, it's when Shaggy and Scooby.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.680
Yes, when Shaggy and Scooby fell in love.

05:49.680 --> 05:55.120
Now, don't confuse this with Scooby Doo The Mystery Begins.

05:55.120 --> 05:55.920
Okay.

05:55.920 --> 06:01.440
Which is a 2009 flick starring Robbie ML as Fred,

06:02.080 --> 06:04.080
Nick Pilatus as Shaggy.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.560
And of course, because he's legally bound to,

06:06.560 --> 06:08.000
Frank Welker is the voice of Scooby Doo.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.200
That is a different, that is an origin story,

06:11.200 --> 06:12.400
but it's a live action one.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.640
Oh, and this is animated?

06:14.640 --> 06:16.560
It's been 10 years, it's time for a reboot.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.400
So, I was thinking for my failed introduction

06:20.400 --> 06:23.680
that I would do something like talking about,

06:23.680 --> 06:25.600
you know, all the drama in the royal family

06:26.160 --> 06:28.560
without actually knowing what that is all about.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.120
Oh boy.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.480
Do you want me to try?

06:32.720 --> 06:34.160
I can try, but do you guys think

06:34.160 --> 06:36.720
two bad introductions is enough for one episode?

06:36.720 --> 06:38.320
Or should we try and get the hat trick

06:38.320 --> 06:39.360
for me talking about the royals?

06:39.360 --> 06:40.320
There's three of us.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.280
Yeah, it seems insane to stop now.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.160
Okay, yeah, I guess there's something going on over there.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.240
They all, I guess one of them, Harry,

06:50.240 --> 06:54.560
I want to say Harry and his spouse, they have left.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.000
They have dipped out of the family.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.920
They said, no, thanks, we're tired of it.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.960
And the queen who is quite old.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.520
How old, how old is she?

07:05.520 --> 07:08.320
She's Trav 60, easy.

07:08.320 --> 07:12.480
She can't believe it is what I've been hearing.

07:12.480 --> 07:15.200
Can you do an impression of her not believing it?

07:15.200 --> 07:17.040
That feels like it may be pushing it

07:17.040 --> 07:18.480
because I don't even actually know

07:18.480 --> 07:22.880
how many people over there feel like protective.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.000
Like, that's my queen, don't do an old voice for her.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.200
You could do like a cool hip voice then.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.880
I mean, it didn't have to be inaccurate.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.680
Okay, you're doing what, Harry?

07:33.680 --> 07:38.880
You're doing what, Harry?

07:38.880 --> 07:39.520
Nailed it.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.040
This is an embarrassing true story.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.360
We were watching The Greatest Showman recently

07:43.360 --> 07:44.720
for the first time because-

07:44.720 --> 07:47.280
Is this gonna be a fourth bad introduction?

07:47.280 --> 07:48.560
No, it's tied to the queen thing.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.440
Okay, okay, okay.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.080
It's tied to the queen thing.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.680
We were watching The Greatest Showman

07:55.680 --> 08:00.400
and there's this scene where they go to visit the queen

08:00.400 --> 08:03.920
and perform in front of the queen.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.160
I was watching this flick and I was looking at her

08:08.160 --> 08:10.800
and I said, she's young, right?

08:13.440 --> 08:15.840
And I said, you know, it's crazy to think

08:15.840 --> 08:16.880
that she's still a queen.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.160
Oh, Justin, buddy.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.480
That film is set in the 1850s.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.760
So that would be quite a thing.

08:29.760 --> 08:33.040
And so it is, I mean, it would be weird

08:33.040 --> 08:35.680
to think that she's still the queen, huh?

08:35.680 --> 08:37.920
And then Sidney was like, are you fucking,

08:39.440 --> 08:40.480
are you fucking idiot?

08:40.480 --> 08:43.040
And I had to do a classic move of like,

08:43.040 --> 08:44.720
wow, you didn't get my great joke.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.920
My cool joke I did.

08:45.920 --> 08:46.480
Cool joke.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.320
Call Blimey didn't get that one, huh?

08:48.960 --> 08:49.680
Oh, bollocks.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.960
Apples and pears.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.440
Oh boy, yeah, I was embarrassed about that.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.360
This would be quite the reveal

08:57.360 --> 09:00.400
if she finds out that it was not in fact a cool joke

09:00.400 --> 09:02.640
she didn't get, but in fact, the fact that I'm an idiot.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.200
It is crazy to think that she's still,

09:07.200 --> 09:11.920
that Queen Victoria is 160 years old and still the queen.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.280
Still kicking it.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.280
Still kicking it, still rocking the castle.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.360
Oh boy.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.920
So this is an advice show, as you've certainly guessed

09:19.920 --> 09:23.040
at this point, we have to do an introduction.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.360
At some point we signed a contract with Jesse Thorne

09:25.360 --> 09:27.280
that said we would do an introduction at the beginning

09:27.280 --> 09:28.000
of every episode.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.720
Next episode, can we just try just fucking chart,

09:32.720 --> 09:36.480
like bull rushing that shit and getting right into it,

09:36.480 --> 09:38.480
like no introduction, just to see how that feels.

09:39.120 --> 09:39.920
Just to see how that does.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.520
That's scary just to think about it.

09:42.160 --> 09:42.640
Okay.

09:42.640 --> 09:43.920
There's no table setting though,

09:43.920 --> 09:45.440
how people get into the vibe.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.000
That feels like a plane doing like a vertical liftoff.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.280
One of my roommates recently broke up with their partner

09:51.280 --> 09:52.880
a month into quarantine.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.720
They're understandably lonely and sad

09:54.720 --> 09:56.080
and need a lot of support.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.240
This afternoon they asked if they could take a nap

09:58.240 --> 10:00.400
in my bed just to have some company.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.680
So I said, sure.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.960
It's now 8.30 and I'm starting to look towards bedtime,

10:04.960 --> 10:07.200
but my roommate is still snoozing.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.560
Do I wake them up?

10:08.560 --> 10:10.080
How do I wake them up?

10:10.080 --> 10:12.000
Do I just go to sleep next to them?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.360
Do I sleep on the couch?

10:13.920 --> 10:16.320
Please, brothers, I work at 7 a.m. tomorrow

10:16.320 --> 10:17.920
and I'm running out of time.

10:17.920 --> 10:22.400
That's from Befuddled by Bedtime in Boston.

10:23.120 --> 10:23.760
Oh boy.

10:23.760 --> 10:27.520
Oh, classic Friends episode.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.200
So I'm assuming-

10:29.200 --> 10:32.560
The one where Joey sleeps and sleeps and sleeps and sleeps.

10:32.560 --> 10:32.800
Yeah.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.160
I'm assuming through context please

10:34.160 --> 10:35.440
that you were not in the bed.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.280
Like you were maybe like watching TV

10:37.280 --> 10:39.760
or playing video games or like sitting at your computer

10:39.760 --> 10:42.000
and they napped to be in the room with you?

10:43.200 --> 10:43.920
Yeah.

10:43.920 --> 10:44.320
Yeah.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.600
Yeah, why?

10:45.600 --> 10:47.120
Yeah, I guess they are in the room.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.080
I don't think you are asleep next to them.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.200
I do like the question, how do I wake them up?

10:53.200 --> 10:55.520
That one seems pretty easy to answer.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.680
Maybe a poke or a shake.

10:57.680 --> 10:58.880
One of those two.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.360
No, you gotta be the Benthier rough thing though.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.880
You have to be gentle.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.840
That has to be, maybe open a window

11:05.840 --> 11:07.520
and let the music of the city.

11:07.520 --> 11:08.320
You know what I mean?

11:08.320 --> 11:12.880
Kind of the soothing jazz coming up from the club

11:12.880 --> 11:14.160
across the empty club,

11:14.160 --> 11:16.160
the unpopulated club across the street.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.200
A kiss of breeze.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.880
The rat-a-tat of the subway drums.

11:20.880 --> 11:25.680
The smell of fresh croissants at the patisserie.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.600
The birds going about their jobs.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.800
They're doing their thing.

11:28.800 --> 11:29.840
One's in the room.

11:29.840 --> 11:32.000
Oh gosh, everyone's awake.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.360
This bird's in here.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.200
Someone get this starling out of here.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.480
Wait, it's cooking?

11:36.480 --> 11:37.520
The bird is cooking?

11:37.520 --> 11:38.560
This is incredible.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.640
He's got an alto saxophone.

11:40.640 --> 11:41.520
Fuck yeah.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.560
Really is cooking.

11:42.560 --> 11:43.280
Yeah.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.840
Oh, it's all about the notes the bird doesn't play.

11:45.840 --> 11:46.800
Come on.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.480
That actually is the last one.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.160
Last time anybody can ever do that.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.280
Oh really?

11:51.280 --> 11:54.000
Everyone write a new joke about jazz, please.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.240
Yeah, so I'm guessing you're in the room with them.

11:56.240 --> 11:56.880
They're napping.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.160
You're uncomfortable with napping next to them.

12:00.160 --> 12:03.360
That's probably a good call unless you wanna,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.400
and I'm not gonna like cast aspersions,

12:06.400 --> 12:08.640
but let's just say escalate it.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.040
Yeah.

12:09.040 --> 12:12.800
This is a bad time for roommates to bump it up

12:12.800 --> 12:14.080
or escalate it.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.760
I mean, even if it's just like unintentional spooning, right?

12:17.760 --> 12:18.720
Don't, yeah.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.960
You're gonna activate, you're gonna escalate,

12:20.960 --> 12:23.040
and this is not the time to be doing that.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.920
It is actually do not activate, do not escalate

12:25.920 --> 12:28.640
is a very good sort of rule of thumb

12:28.640 --> 12:31.600
for I think everyone in our current situation.

12:31.600 --> 12:35.360
De-escalation is going to present some serious injuries.

12:35.360 --> 12:35.680
But also-

12:35.680 --> 12:36.080
You know what?

12:36.080 --> 12:38.000
Maybe go sleep in their bed.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.160
Yes, no.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.600
And then just switch rooms.

12:42.400 --> 12:46.080
I'm saying specifically with a roommate scenario,

12:46.080 --> 12:49.520
you are tied to them.

12:49.520 --> 12:54.400
You are doing a three-legged to five or seven

12:54.400 --> 12:58.320
or some odd number of leg race with these people right now

12:58.880 --> 13:00.800
and you cannot escalate that

13:00.800 --> 13:06.080
or else you are just like really weighing yourself down.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.800
One thing you should do is wake them up and be like,

13:08.800 --> 13:10.080
hey, I didn't wanna,

13:10.080 --> 13:12.880
this is your circadian rhythms are gonna be fucked.

13:12.880 --> 13:13.200
Yeah.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.640
You have gotta get it together.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.080
You can't be sleeping right now.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.320
Go out and take a jog.

13:18.320 --> 13:19.360
Don't take a jog.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.240
You can socially distance the jog.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.680
I don't care about the jog though.

13:23.680 --> 13:24.960
They just need to be up and out

13:24.960 --> 13:26.400
and I'm worried about their rhythms.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.040
The circadian rhythms.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.160
They're gonna mess themselves up.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.640
You shouldn't be napping till 8.30.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.000
When did the naps start?

13:36.000 --> 13:36.640
I don't know.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.000
We don't have the information.

13:38.000 --> 13:38.320
Fuck.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.280
But here's the thing,

13:39.280 --> 13:41.360
unless the answer to that is 8.15,

13:41.360 --> 13:42.480
it's gone on too long.

13:42.480 --> 13:46.880
8.30 is like the best fucking time.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.680
8.30 is like my favorite time of day.

13:49.680 --> 13:54.160
My time of day is 8.30.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.000
That's must see TV right there.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.240
Must see TV is on, kiddos in bed,

13:59.040 --> 14:00.800
had your dinner, belly full,

14:00.800 --> 14:02.720
maybe having a little cocktail,

14:02.720 --> 14:05.200
something to wind down the day.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.160
And it's just started.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.880
You're not like bumping up against bedtime just yet.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.320
It seems like you could do anything.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.120
We have time to,

14:11.120 --> 14:13.680
we could start a movie at 8.30.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.920
Oh my god, that's exactly what I was about to say.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.920
Why would you want to be asleep during the 8.30 times,

14:19.920 --> 14:21.600
which is the best fucking times?

14:22.400 --> 14:24.000
It is, it was literally,

14:24.000 --> 14:25.680
I did not see the Star War,

14:25.680 --> 14:27.440
the new Star War in the theaters.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.560
It came out, literally it was out for,

14:30.560 --> 14:34.640
I believe three weeks before we finally timed it out.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.360
Where it's like,

14:35.360 --> 14:37.840
we have time to watch this entire Star War.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.320
We finally got the kids to bed early enough

14:40.320 --> 14:41.760
to watch the Star War.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.760
Still started to fall asleep hour in,

14:43.760 --> 14:45.680
did have to break it up into two showings.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.400
Sleep at 11 p.m.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.200
Nap at 1.30 p.m.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.720
Nothing at 1.30.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.320
Yeah, there's nothing fucking going,

14:54.320 --> 14:55.120
nothing good going on.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.720
No, nobody's doing shit.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.040
8.30 is bumping, baby.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.480
That's when the music of the city

15:00.480 --> 15:02.880
is really hitting its zenith.

15:02.880 --> 15:03.680
Oh yeah.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.800
That's where you get like the wheels cross,

15:06.800 --> 15:08.560
they cross like the grates and you get that

15:08.560 --> 15:10.480
bum bum to bum bum bum.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.160
As the cars drive by, you know.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.040
The rhythm of the city.

15:13.040 --> 15:13.360
Yeah.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.320
You get it.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.080
We all know what the rhythm of the city is, Charles.

15:16.080 --> 15:16.720
Yeah.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.480
Bum bum sss, bum bum bum bum sss.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.000
Yeah, bum bum sss.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.400
I got a Yahoo that was sent in by several people.

15:22.400 --> 15:22.960
I got hot dogs here.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.120
I got hot dogs here.

15:25.120 --> 15:28.000
Umbrella, umbrella, umbrella, umbrella, umbrella, umbrella,

15:28.000 --> 15:29.200
umbrella, umbrella.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.200
Extra extra, read all about it.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.880
Extra extra, read all about it.

15:32.880 --> 15:33.840
He's bleeding.

15:33.840 --> 15:34.880
He's bleeding.

15:34.880 --> 15:35.760
It's everywhere.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.760
Get off my bus.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.840
Hey, get off my bus.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.760
Hey, I dropped all my eggs.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.000
I dropped all my eggs.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.520
There goes the baker with his tray like always.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.680
Marie, the baguettes.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.680
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by several people.

15:57.680 --> 15:58.400
Thank you, everyone.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.400
It was an anonymous Yahoo answers user

16:00.400 --> 16:04.880
who I'm going to call, this one's just named John.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.680
Oh, is it spelled funny?

16:07.680 --> 16:11.920
No, J-O-H-N.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.120
That's what it says in my mind.

16:13.680 --> 16:16.240
John asks, where do you-

16:16.240 --> 16:17.440
Sorry, one sec.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.000
Can we just talk about the Martian Bay Hunter for a second?

16:21.680 --> 16:22.240
Of course.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.720
Okay, Martian Bay Hunter.

16:24.720 --> 16:25.120
What?

16:25.760 --> 16:26.080
Okay.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.600
His name is John Jones.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.960
Okay, I want to talk about this.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.160
I want to talk about this.

16:30.800 --> 16:31.440
Finally.

16:32.160 --> 16:35.360
Finally, someone create, hey, Tim,

16:35.360 --> 16:39.440
I need you to create a new superhero by the end of the day.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.560
Okay, so did you finish your assignment?

16:42.560 --> 16:43.520
It's actually Joseph.

16:44.640 --> 16:45.520
Joseph Sandwichen.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.320
Did you finish your assignment, Joseph?

16:48.320 --> 16:49.440
I did, yes.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.680
This is the Martian Manhunter.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.440
He's an alien who manhunts.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.400
That's very good.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.680
Does he have a secret identity?

16:55.680 --> 16:56.960
Because those are huge right now.

16:56.960 --> 16:57.680
Yes.

16:57.680 --> 16:58.400
Yes, he does.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.760
Okay, so what's his secret identity?

17:01.760 --> 17:05.120
Um, John.

17:05.840 --> 17:09.280
Oh, is that like a human name he took to blend in?

17:10.880 --> 17:13.360
J, no, it's different.

17:13.360 --> 17:17.520
It's J apostrophe O-N-N.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.800
So John is his name.

17:18.800 --> 17:19.360
John?

17:20.400 --> 17:23.520
Yes, John is his secret identity.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.000
Does he have a last name?

17:26.640 --> 17:27.360
It's Jones.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.400
Is that just like regular?

17:30.400 --> 17:38.560
Um, it's actually J apostrophe O-N-C-Z.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.800
So hold on, let me just check real quick, Joseph.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.560
It's John Jones.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.360
It's real weird and alien.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.400
It's really different.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.440
So weird and alien?

17:51.440 --> 17:54.480
And I came up with it a long time ago and not now.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.280
So Joseph, you're telling me that it's weird and alien,

17:57.280 --> 18:00.640
but they still use letters like J and O and N?

18:01.360 --> 18:03.200
It's John Jones.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.880
The letters are the same even in space, Travis.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.440
It's the constant universal language is letters.

18:11.840 --> 18:12.400
So-

18:12.400 --> 18:13.200
I'm sorry.

18:13.200 --> 18:13.920
Okay, so sorry.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.120
Go ahead with the Yahoo.

18:15.120 --> 18:18.320
Yeah, that was a fun little detour.

18:19.600 --> 18:23.600
John asks, where do guys place their valuables when grinding?

18:24.560 --> 18:25.600
Thank you.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.080
If I'm grinding with a girl, I'm wearing jeans

18:28.080 --> 18:30.720
and think that it's would be more comfortable for both of us

18:30.720 --> 18:35.040
if my front pockets are empty, makes the dance feel better.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.000
But then I will need my wallet and phone with me.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.760
So where do you think I should place them?

18:39.760 --> 18:42.960
I know about the back pockets, but what about other places?

18:42.960 --> 18:44.000
I'm a guy, lol.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.640
Okay, first of all, it's 2020.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.160
You can grind with anybody.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.000
Like anybody can grind with anybody, all right?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.280
So I don't think that this has to-

18:51.280 --> 18:53.040
Actually, let me, if I could just-

18:53.040 --> 18:55.520
Just, nobody can grind with a girl.

18:55.520 --> 18:56.880
Oh, right now, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.240
Just nobody can grind with anybody.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.320
Right, grind yourself, baby.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.640
I feel like the problem with this is like,

19:02.640 --> 19:05.280
there have been so many numerous innovations

19:05.280 --> 19:07.760
that have been designed to fix this very problem.

19:07.760 --> 19:10.640
And the problem is society has turned their back on them.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.960
I'm thinking mostly of the fanny pack.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.880
The fanny pack was there, so you could sing-

19:14.880 --> 19:17.200
You're saying the fanny pack is not gonna-

19:17.200 --> 19:23.760
I guess the fanny pack, when deployed above the fanny,

19:24.720 --> 19:28.320
in non-sort of British terminology,

19:28.880 --> 19:30.080
the American fanny.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.160
The American fanny.

19:32.160 --> 19:35.520
When deployed above the American fanny for the,

19:36.560 --> 19:39.360
let's say the top in the grinding scenario,

19:39.360 --> 19:40.480
then it would be out of the way.

19:40.480 --> 19:45.760
I guess the bottom in the grind could be wearing the fanny pack

19:45.760 --> 19:47.040
in the British sense.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.960
Yes, and you know, as long as we're talking about it now,

19:50.960 --> 19:52.480
what about grind butlers?

19:53.280 --> 19:54.880
Oh, that's cool.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.440
Yeah, butlers deployed throughout the dance floor

19:57.440 --> 20:00.480
with trays who will take and hold your valuables,

20:00.480 --> 20:02.800
and most importantly, protect them,

20:03.680 --> 20:08.160
while you get your grind on, as the kids say.

20:10.160 --> 20:14.240
Hi, I'm pitching, I'm looking for a $10 million investment

20:14.240 --> 20:16.960
for my idea, grind butlers.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.040
So I'd be like, Grimsby, I'm finished!

20:19.760 --> 20:21.360
And you would come over with a silver tray

20:21.360 --> 20:23.680
that had my phone and my inhaler on it,

20:23.680 --> 20:25.040
after I finished grinding?

20:25.040 --> 20:26.480
Correct, correct.

20:26.480 --> 20:26.800
Okay.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.680
And here's the thing, if someone tried to take your inhaler,

20:29.680 --> 20:31.840
Grimsby's throwing elbows.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.160
So he has to be strong.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.800
Oh yeah, he's a burly butler.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.720
I have a lot of questions, actually, about this, Travis.

20:38.720 --> 20:39.520
I'm glad you brought it up.

20:39.520 --> 20:43.760
So Grimsby, the grinding butler, he doesn't participate-

20:43.760 --> 20:45.440
We can just say Gretler, by the way,

20:45.440 --> 20:46.720
if you wanna shorten it.

20:46.720 --> 20:47.680
I do.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.560
Grimsby the Gretler.

20:48.560 --> 20:50.720
Grimsby the Gretler is gonna watch,

20:50.720 --> 20:51.680
does he watch me do?

20:52.880 --> 20:55.040
Oh yeah, he needs to be there, because you need him.

20:55.040 --> 20:59.120
He's not just, okay, he performs other butler duties as well,

20:59.120 --> 21:02.960
but his prime directive is to collect valuables

21:02.960 --> 21:04.960
whilst grinding, so he's there for you.

21:04.960 --> 21:08.160
But I think I want him in earshot, but not eyeshot,

21:08.160 --> 21:11.520
so if I could, I place a little mask on his eyes.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.200
I'll hand him my inhaler, I'll hand him my phone,

21:15.200 --> 21:19.360
I'll hand him some of the toys that I have in my pocket,

21:19.360 --> 21:20.480
and he'll put them on a tray,

21:22.000 --> 21:23.360
and then I can slip a little mask,

21:23.360 --> 21:25.200
like a sleep mask, over his eyes

21:25.200 --> 21:27.200
so he doesn't see me do what I'm about to do.

21:28.960 --> 21:32.400
Do you put the pieces of trash that you mean to throw away?

21:32.400 --> 21:34.560
Is that weird to give Grimsby the Gretler?

21:34.560 --> 21:38.800
No, in fact, he gets kind of offended if you don't give it to him,

21:38.800 --> 21:40.400
because he's like, that's my job, sir.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.200
Now, I have a question, here's a different question.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.000
Yes, yes, yes.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.800
Will he be monitoring my text messages

21:46.800 --> 21:48.880
for information that I might want?

21:48.880 --> 21:49.120
Yeah.

21:49.120 --> 21:52.160
Like, am I gonna be grinding, and Grimsby's like,

21:52.720 --> 21:56.480
excuse me, sir, but there's a text here from Stinky D.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.680
He says, Stumbler's 2 is bumpin', get down here.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.440
I can't miss that.

22:01.440 --> 22:02.240
Yes, indeed.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.000
He will also remind you to hydrate,

22:05.760 --> 22:07.600
because, I mean, that's very important.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.320
Now, he will not get you the drink,

22:10.320 --> 22:12.160
let's be clear, he will not get you the drink.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.760
He's not a butler, for fuck's sake.

22:13.760 --> 22:14.800
That is not his job.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.480
Don't insult him, yes.

22:16.480 --> 22:20.160
Now, I guess just another question, Trav,

22:20.160 --> 22:21.920
for this product, which is a man.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.520
Wait, before I move on, sorry, Griffin,

22:23.520 --> 22:25.920
I do wanna hear that question, I do wanna ask something.

22:25.920 --> 22:30.720
If I go to get a drink, will Grimsby take my grinding spot

22:30.720 --> 22:31.520
and hold it?

22:31.520 --> 22:32.160
I don't want that.

22:32.160 --> 22:35.200
Now, here's the thing, not with your partner, or partners,

22:35.200 --> 22:37.920
right, but he will kind of spread his arms

22:37.920 --> 22:40.480
to create a perimeter so that he can maintain

22:40.480 --> 22:42.720
the hold you have created to do your thing.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.480
And I want him to maintain the rhythm.

22:44.480 --> 22:48.000
Like, I wanna just hop right back in to the rhythm.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.720
No, he will definitely, he will act as an avatar

22:50.720 --> 22:51.520
for your grinding.

22:51.520 --> 22:52.160
Perfect, cool.

22:52.720 --> 22:55.760
So, my question that Justin so rudely interrupted is,

22:56.400 --> 23:00.080
I've given Grimsby my valuables to hold,

23:00.800 --> 23:04.800
and then I'm grinding, and I do pass away

23:05.520 --> 23:06.880
while I'm grinding.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.560
Yes, they are his.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.440
Yeah, they're his now.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.440
I'm not sure I want that to happen, Travis,

23:13.440 --> 23:17.760
but I want him to be able to, like, those would still be

23:17.760 --> 23:20.320
sort of, like, under my will.

23:21.120 --> 23:24.480
When you hire Grimsby, you have to name him the executor.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.160
Correct, correct.

23:26.160 --> 23:31.280
So if you grind so hard you die, he will settle your affairs.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.760
And he will also, I should, this is an, okay,

23:33.760 --> 23:36.080
I'm glad you asked, because this is in the front print,

23:36.080 --> 23:38.160
he will not only take your valuables,

23:38.160 --> 23:41.040
he will take on your whole personality

23:41.040 --> 23:42.240
and continue grinding.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.360
Because our slogan here at Grind Butler's

23:45.360 --> 23:46.640
is the grind goes on.

23:48.160 --> 23:52.240
One other thing to bear is that circumstances of your death

23:52.240 --> 23:54.400
are in any way mysterious.

23:54.400 --> 23:58.240
Grimsby will not rest until the crime is solved.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.320
That's true, even if he committed it.

24:00.320 --> 24:03.680
That's the intro, like, he will hunt himself down.

24:03.680 --> 24:04.000
Right.

24:04.000 --> 24:09.040
He checks that first, though, because the Butler did it,

24:09.040 --> 24:12.240
the Gretler didn't, so you don't have to worry about that.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.480
And now there is one thing,

24:15.280 --> 24:16.480
we've done a lot of product testing.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.400
Sounds good so far, though, so far.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.240
We've done a lot of product testing,

24:20.240 --> 24:22.080
and there is kind of one big pitfall

24:22.080 --> 24:23.040
that you need to be aware of.

24:23.040 --> 24:25.760
You need to be careful that you don't fall in love

24:25.760 --> 24:26.480
with Grimsby.

24:26.480 --> 24:31.200
That happened because he's so reliable and, like, dependable,

24:31.200 --> 24:32.720
and, you know, you're out there on the dance floor

24:32.720 --> 24:34.960
trying to make a connection, and it keeps falling apart,

24:34.960 --> 24:36.240
and who's always there for you?

24:36.240 --> 24:41.120
It's Grimsby, and after a while, like, it becomes sexual,

24:42.080 --> 24:44.080
and you have to be really careful there.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.760
I'm just going to come out and say,

24:45.760 --> 24:49.520
just like bathroom stuff, is this going to be a problem

24:49.520 --> 24:50.320
for Grimsby?

24:50.320 --> 24:52.560
Does he have the sort of biological needs,

24:52.560 --> 24:53.520
as I understand them?

24:53.520 --> 24:55.040
Well, he's trained.

24:55.040 --> 24:57.920
He's highly trained in tantric peeing,

24:57.920 --> 25:02.240
so he can go all night and then just pee once.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.400
He's always peeing a little bit, you mean?

25:04.400 --> 25:05.360
Yeah, yeah.

25:05.360 --> 25:09.200
Do you mean he holds his pee, or do you, no, clarify, please?

25:09.200 --> 25:10.240
Well, you have the option.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.280
It's up to you.

25:11.280 --> 25:13.600
I'm thinking about how much it's going to cost me

25:13.600 --> 25:15.520
to keep the track suit.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.760
He has special pants that tuck into his boots,

25:18.320 --> 25:20.720
and so he can pee a little bit the whole time,

25:20.720 --> 25:23.840
or if you would prefer not to have to replace the boots

25:23.840 --> 25:25.680
every night, because that is on you.

25:25.680 --> 25:26.720
That expense is on you.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.040
It's like a classy place.

25:29.040 --> 25:32.000
Yeah, then he does need a 45-minute break

25:32.560 --> 25:33.680
just once a night.

25:34.720 --> 25:37.120
Once a day, frankly, if you're partying straight,

25:37.120 --> 25:40.080
like if we're in a Coachella situation or something

25:40.080 --> 25:43.840
and you never want to leave, then he can do once every,

25:43.840 --> 25:47.120
he can go 72 hours, but then he does need four hours off.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.240
He's like a camel, yeah.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.400
And Trav, I'm glad you answered that,

25:50.400 --> 25:52.000
because I was wondering if maybe you could address

25:52.000 --> 25:54.400
the rumors that have been circulating that Grimsby

25:54.400 --> 25:57.600
does emit just a constant kind of foul odor

25:57.600 --> 26:00.640
that no one seems to know exactly where it's coming from.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.520
That's not with every Grimsby.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.840
Sometimes it's just a weird humming noise.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.120
Yeah.

26:07.120 --> 26:10.160
That is, yeah, and the odor, okay,

26:10.160 --> 26:12.080
so it's actually the odor and the humming noise,

26:12.080 --> 26:15.920
but usually the odor, and as weird as this is to say,

26:15.920 --> 26:18.960
drowns out the humming noise, if that makes any sense.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.080
Yeah, sure.

26:20.080 --> 26:23.840
No, it's a chemical smell, which is worrying.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.800
Yeah, no, it's very upsetting,

26:26.800 --> 26:28.480
but so far, I mean, listen,

26:28.480 --> 26:30.560
we're still in early stages of testing at this point.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.960
The Grimsby model's only been on the market

26:32.960 --> 26:33.680
for a couple months.

26:33.680 --> 26:37.440
We have no idea what the long-term issues are,

26:37.440 --> 26:39.600
but for right now, still looking

26:39.600 --> 26:41.840
for that $10 million investment, so.

26:41.840 --> 26:46.000
It's yours, it's yours for 0% of the company.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.760
That sounds great, that's a great deal.

26:47.760 --> 26:48.260
Yeah.

26:48.560 --> 26:50.960
If Griffin wants to make good on this incredible offer,

26:50.960 --> 26:52.720
he's gonna need to start building wealth,

26:52.720 --> 26:55.040
and the only way that we know how to do that

26:55.040 --> 27:08.320
is to take you with us to the money's end.

27:08.320 --> 27:12.320
I like everyone else of good moral fiber.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.040
I'm trying to limit my visits into the outside world

27:15.040 --> 27:16.400
as much as possible lately,

27:16.400 --> 27:20.240
and one of the most convenient ways I've found of doing that

27:20.240 --> 27:22.000
is utilizing stamps.com.

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
If you need to mail stuff, you need to buy postage,

27:28.000 --> 27:28.960
you know, mailing stuff.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.480
Yeah, mail stuff.

27:30.480 --> 27:32.000
You know, post office stuff.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.040
You can do it with stamps.com,

27:35.680 --> 27:38.720
and it's not just US Postal Service rates.

27:38.720 --> 27:41.840
Stamps.com also offers UPS services

27:41.840 --> 27:43.840
with discount rates up to 62%,

27:44.880 --> 27:46.320
and with stamps.com,

27:46.320 --> 27:49.920
you don't have to pay UPS residential surcharges,

27:49.920 --> 27:52.720
so it kind of like turns your home,

27:52.720 --> 27:53.840
your board with your house,

27:53.840 --> 27:56.160
why not turn it into a post office space?

27:56.160 --> 27:57.600
Not for public usage.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.960
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.080
Don't do that.

28:00.080 --> 28:04.960
Don't do that, but it can serve all the same purposes.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.640
Now, you could do it, I think,

28:06.640 --> 28:08.800
for the members of your household.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.280
You could set it up and make them come to you.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.000
That's iffy.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.160
I guess if you charge them, it's probably,

28:16.880 --> 28:18.400
yeah, that's probably bad.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.280
In addition to saving time and gas and safety,

28:21.280 --> 28:23.200
you know, not going to the post office,

28:23.200 --> 28:24.400
they also have some discounts.

28:24.400 --> 28:27.360
Stamps.com is gonna give you five cents off

28:27.360 --> 28:28.880
every first-class stamp,

28:28.880 --> 28:32.160
up to 40% off USPS shipping rates,

28:32.800 --> 28:35.200
and right now, our listeners can get a special offer

28:35.200 --> 28:36.800
that includes a four-week trial,

28:36.800 --> 28:40.080
plus free postage and a digital scale

28:40.080 --> 28:42.320
without any long-term commitment.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.600
Just go to stamps.com,

28:43.600 --> 28:45.840
click the microphone at the top of the homepage,

28:45.840 --> 28:49.200
and type in my brother, all one word.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.240
That's stamps.com, enter my brother.

28:53.520 --> 28:54.400
Stay safe, friends.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.440
It's actually my friends, Justin.

28:57.440 --> 28:58.960
Yeah, stay safe, my friends.

28:58.960 --> 29:01.360
It is important that we hit that

29:02.080 --> 29:04.400
every time that we do talk about stamps,

29:04.400 --> 29:06.480
because, and I think this is fucked up,

29:06.480 --> 29:08.480
and I won't say this, I wouldn't say this to stamps,

29:08.480 --> 29:10.160
so I hope they're not listening.

29:10.160 --> 29:10.480
They're not.

29:10.480 --> 29:11.600
But I think it's fucked up

29:11.600 --> 29:16.000
that stamps only wants their friends to be safe.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.920
And to be fair, they're not wishing ill

29:19.920 --> 29:20.880
to their non-friends.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.720
No, no, no, no, no, but they are just saying,

29:22.720 --> 29:25.840
hey, my friends, stay safe.

29:25.840 --> 29:29.120
Everyone else, do what you're gonna do.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.280
Yeah, it's fine.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.560
Listen, I can't control my not-friends,

29:34.560 --> 29:35.200
you know what I mean?

29:35.200 --> 29:36.400
I don't know them.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.600
Hey, do you know what has been really helping me

29:39.600 --> 29:40.640
through these tough times?

29:40.640 --> 29:42.320
It is my underwear that I wear.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.840
Oh, you didn't even give me time to guess.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.080
Well, yeah, there was no point,

29:46.080 --> 29:47.200
because you knew what the answer is,

29:47.200 --> 29:48.720
because we're looking at ad copy together.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.960
Yeah, but I was gonna say something like,

29:50.960 --> 29:53.680
you know, the love of family and friends.

29:53.680 --> 29:53.920
No.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.560
Or like your brain meds, or like,

29:57.280 --> 29:59.440
I don't know, your child's laughter.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.600
No, man, it's my Goodyear wear, bruh.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.760
It's talking about me undies,

30:06.560 --> 30:09.360
because they are comfortable as hell,

30:09.360 --> 30:11.360
whether we're talking about undies,

30:11.360 --> 30:13.840
whether you're talking about loungewear,

30:13.840 --> 30:17.120
or them onesies, which are so soft.

30:18.240 --> 30:20.560
They got all kinds of really comfy shit.

30:21.200 --> 30:22.000
You know what I like?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.600
I like their t-shirts.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.360
Oh, the t-shirts are fantastic.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.880
Mm, love them.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.520
You can also get a membership from me undies,

30:29.520 --> 30:31.840
and it is very, very handy.

30:31.840 --> 30:32.960
Imagine this, every month,

30:32.960 --> 30:36.800
the softest, coziest undies magically appear at your door.

30:37.680 --> 30:38.960
And on your body.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.080
And then on your body.

30:40.720 --> 30:41.840
That part's not magical.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.120
You do that with your hands.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.480
It feels magical.

30:44.480 --> 30:48.640
You get more of these underwear with this membership,

30:49.600 --> 30:52.880
and you're just gonna be living the dream.

30:52.880 --> 30:55.040
Also, a membership comes with site-wide savings,

30:55.040 --> 30:56.720
early access, and free shipping,

30:57.440 --> 30:59.360
and zero reasons to ever leave your house.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.920
You just grab those new undies right off the porch,

31:02.560 --> 31:03.840
and it does say here,

31:03.840 --> 31:06.000
get back to that summertime dreamin',

31:06.000 --> 31:09.680
which I, rarely do we read this verbatim,

31:09.680 --> 31:11.520
but damn, that's strong.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.720
Anyway, you can get 15% off your first order,

31:14.720 --> 31:16.960
free shipping, and a 100% satisfaction guarantee

31:16.960 --> 31:18.720
by going to meundies.com slash my brother.

31:18.720 --> 31:20.880
That's meundies.com slash my brother.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.720
Hi, I'm Jackie Cashin.

31:22.720 --> 31:24.160
Hi, I'm Lori Kilmartin.

31:24.160 --> 31:27.040
And we have a podcast called the Jackie and Lori Show.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.560
Who are you, Lori Kilmartin?

31:28.560 --> 31:30.080
Oh my God, so much pressure.

31:30.720 --> 31:33.760
See, I'm a stand-up of the new stand-up since 1987.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.040
I'm a writer for Conan.

31:35.040 --> 31:36.080
I've written a couple of books,

31:36.080 --> 31:38.640
have a couple of CDs out, have a special out.

31:38.640 --> 31:39.920
Who are you, Jackie?

31:39.920 --> 31:43.680
Well, I too am a stand-up comic since 1984.

31:43.680 --> 31:46.560
And I do the road like a maniac

31:46.560 --> 31:48.560
and don't have a cool writing job,

31:48.560 --> 31:51.120
but I have four albums out working on a new album.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.480
We talk about stand-up.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.680
We talk about all the different parts of stand-up comedy.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.440
So that's the Jackie and Lori Show,

31:57.440 --> 32:00.080
and you should subscribe on Maximum Fun

32:00.080 --> 32:00.960
if you want to hear that.

32:00.960 --> 32:06.400
Yeah, and I would encourage you not to.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.320
Yes, yes.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.920
Oh man, you were right on it.

32:13.600 --> 32:14.800
I want to munch.

32:14.800 --> 32:15.300
Squad.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.760
I want to munch.

32:19.760 --> 32:20.260
Squad.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.200
Welcome to Munch Squad.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.120
It's a podcast within a podcast.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.280
I was trying to take you back to 2007

32:29.280 --> 32:34.800
with that introduction because it is the Munch Squad,

32:34.800 --> 32:35.680
what would we call it?

32:35.680 --> 32:36.880
Munch Squad Retro?

32:38.080 --> 32:39.760
I think you've called it a different fucking thing

32:39.760 --> 32:40.400
every single time.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.760
Yeah, let's keep doing that.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.920
This is throwback Munch Squad.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.560
We're going back into the archives for some classics.

32:47.280 --> 32:48.720
This one comes to us from Jacob.

32:48.720 --> 32:49.600
Thank you, Jacob.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.960
And it's Cold Stone Creamery.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.800
And this is really like peak,

32:56.080 --> 32:57.840
I don't know if this is peak wildness,

32:57.840 --> 33:01.120
but this has to be one of the earliest examples

33:01.120 --> 33:04.800
of absolutely wild press releases I have seen.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.000
It's from 2007.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.720
Cold Stone Creamery unveils new frozen treat innovations

33:08.720 --> 33:09.520
for the love of it.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.600
The love of the game?

33:13.600 --> 33:14.240
The ice cream?

33:15.920 --> 33:17.520
Y'all can't get hung up on this, okay?

33:17.520 --> 33:18.480
This is a wild one.

33:18.480 --> 33:18.980
Okay.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.640
If there were an encyclopedia definition

33:23.200 --> 33:25.120
for passionate ice cream lover,

33:25.760 --> 33:27.040
it would read something like this.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.320
Oh boy.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.920
A passionate ice cream lover

33:29.920 --> 33:31.760
is one that is unapologetic

33:32.640 --> 33:34.080
about their obsession with ice cream.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.320
Why did you kill that man?

33:36.320 --> 33:38.160
I don't need to answer to you.

33:38.960 --> 33:42.240
This person craves the highest quality ice cream

33:42.240 --> 33:44.480
made just the way they like it.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.000
I mean, ice cream, right?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.520
Just make it in the ice cream way

33:48.160 --> 33:49.200
that results in ice.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.280
There seems like a pretty narrow band of things

33:51.280 --> 33:52.320
that will result in ice cream.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.720
I like it in a ball shape on a cone or a cup.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.880
This person craves the highest quality ice cream

33:56.880 --> 33:58.240
made just the way they like it,

33:58.240 --> 34:00.240
and at one time or another,

34:00.240 --> 34:02.800
has crossed the line to get it.

34:02.800 --> 34:07.440
What the fuck are you talking about right now?

34:07.440 --> 34:08.800
What are you implying?

34:08.800 --> 34:09.840
What line?

34:09.840 --> 34:11.200
The thin blue line?

34:12.000 --> 34:12.720
Oh boy.

34:12.720 --> 34:13.360
What line?

34:14.240 --> 34:14.740
The ice cream.

34:14.740 --> 34:15.280
The red line?

34:15.280 --> 34:19.440
Listen guys, I worked at TCBY for a summer and a half.

34:19.440 --> 34:23.200
There's a fucking line, and you do not cross it.

34:23.200 --> 34:24.640
Would you not cross it?

34:24.640 --> 34:26.320
Maybe it's the picket line?

34:26.320 --> 34:28.400
Was there a big strike going on in 2007?

34:28.400 --> 34:28.960
I don't remember.

34:29.680 --> 34:31.600
This ice cream flavor is scab.

34:32.240 --> 34:36.160
Cold Stone Creamery's taste master, Ray Karam,

34:36.160 --> 34:37.760
understands this desperate love

34:37.760 --> 34:40.320
for customized super premium ice cream,

34:40.320 --> 34:43.520
and even has a story or two about crossing that line.

34:43.520 --> 34:44.000
Jesus.

34:44.000 --> 34:44.400
Oh my God.

34:45.680 --> 34:48.640
Luckily, Karam harnessed that passion,

34:48.640 --> 34:50.480
enthusiasm for ice cream

34:50.480 --> 34:52.880
to develop an array of innovative frozen treats

34:52.880 --> 34:54.800
available at stores throughout the country,

34:55.520 --> 34:56.560
starting June 1st.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.400
Thank God he harnessed his passion

34:58.400 --> 35:01.360
before it could destroy him and those he loved.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.600
Can you imagine that kind of ice cream line

35:03.600 --> 35:06.480
crossing passion out just in the streets?

35:06.480 --> 35:10.400
Well, to be fair, he harnessed it while in ice cream jail.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.840
Like it was a state mandatory crossing.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.640
In his quest to incorporate ice cream

35:16.640 --> 35:17.920
into every part of the day,

35:17.920 --> 35:20.400
Karam has developed French toast ice cream.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.360
Jesus.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.120
And no flavor would be complete without

35:23.120 --> 35:25.200
a custom creation combination.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.840
In this case, it's French toast with the most.

35:27.840 --> 35:29.280
Made with French toast ice cream

35:29.280 --> 35:30.720
mixed together with apple pie,

35:30.720 --> 35:32.480
filling pecans and cinnamon.

35:32.480 --> 35:34.320
Now, if only ice cream would become

35:34.320 --> 35:36.160
an acceptable breakfast food,

35:36.160 --> 35:39.760
ice cream lovers around the world would rejoice.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.760
So this has been a pretty long press release so far.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.560
And so far, I have learned that there is a dude out there

35:44.560 --> 35:47.360
who really does like and enjoy ice cream a lot.

35:47.360 --> 35:51.520
And they do have French toast with some mix-ins.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.400
And it has taken like seven paragraphs to get there.

35:55.440 --> 35:59.520
This next line was good enough

35:59.520 --> 36:01.680
that I stopped reading the press release

36:01.680 --> 36:04.080
because I decided that even if it was just

36:04.080 --> 36:05.920
what I've read so far in this line,

36:06.480 --> 36:07.440
it would be fine.

36:07.440 --> 36:08.640
It would be acceptable.

36:08.640 --> 36:10.080
I have no idea what comes next.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.680
We're all going to find out together.

36:11.680 --> 36:13.520
After developing French toast ice cream,

36:13.520 --> 36:16.560
you can imagine the taste master became parched

36:16.560 --> 36:18.080
and in need of a pick-me-up.

36:18.080 --> 36:21.680
Oh, I'm spent.

36:21.680 --> 36:22.960
I can't imagine that.

36:23.760 --> 36:24.480
No more.

36:24.480 --> 36:26.080
That's precisely what I imagined.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.000
It is finished.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.280
When I heard that, I thought,

36:29.280 --> 36:31.520
man, that dude must've gotten mad thirsty

36:31.520 --> 36:33.120
after thinking of that ice cream flavor.

36:33.680 --> 36:34.800
You can imagine that.

36:35.840 --> 36:38.960
As a result, the already exciting line of smoothies,

36:39.600 --> 36:41.520
which is a, I mean, I don't know what they,

36:41.520 --> 36:43.760
they seem to know what they're talking about.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.000
The smoothies now has a new edition

36:46.000 --> 36:47.200
that packs a punch.

36:47.200 --> 36:50.560
The new Mountain Dew smoothie called Dew Iced

36:50.560 --> 36:52.400
delivers amazing tastes combined

36:52.400 --> 36:54.000
with an exhilarating boost.

36:54.000 --> 36:54.640
Fuck yes.

36:55.840 --> 36:59.520
With Dew Iced appealing to the heart,

36:59.520 --> 37:02.480
sorry, with Dew Iced appealing to the young at heart,

37:03.040 --> 37:05.040
Karim thought it was best to honor,

37:05.840 --> 37:08.080
next honor those ice cream sentimentalists

37:08.080 --> 37:10.000
that love a good old fashioned Sunday.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.960
And that is with a capital S and the A at the end.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.400
So you know it's fucking fancy.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.800
The starting June 1st, Cold Stone Creamy

37:16.800 --> 37:18.800
wore off of three new Sundays

37:18.800 --> 37:21.680
that feature indulgent, rich ingredient layers

37:21.680 --> 37:23.040
together as such.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.320
This is the fucking,

37:24.320 --> 37:26.400
I'm not messing up the words anymore.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.160
This is just the wildest.

37:28.160 --> 37:28.480
Okay.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.440
They didn't think anyone would keep reading past this point.

37:31.440 --> 37:31.940
Yeah.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.400
I'm not going to list these.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.400
There's no way they're available anymore.

37:36.400 --> 37:39.920
Quote, this time of year always makes me smile.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.400
The weather is warm.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.560
Families are spending time outdoors.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.520
I bet it does make you smile, you greedy fuck.

37:47.520 --> 37:49.120
You ice cream pervert.

37:49.120 --> 37:50.960
You ice cream pervert.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.360
I bet you do get horny when the weather's warm.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.360
And families are spending time outdoors,

37:55.360 --> 37:58.000
making it the ideal time to enjoy ice cream together.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.080
No fucking shit, Karim.

38:00.080 --> 38:00.960
Damn.

38:00.960 --> 38:03.600
Inspired by my own summertime memories,

38:03.600 --> 38:06.880
I set out to develop several new innovative frozen treats

38:06.880 --> 38:08.880
that add to the merriment of the season.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.800
We've been doing this a long time.

38:10.800 --> 38:14.320
I'm not sure I've ever seen someone in the press release.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.320
It's like fucking, I did it again.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.400
Get on me.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.920
I really, I did it again.

38:21.920 --> 38:25.520
And I'm so proud of myself for doing it,

38:25.520 --> 38:26.560
crushing it once again.

38:27.440 --> 38:30.000
For those ice cream lovers that want their ice cream

38:30.000 --> 38:31.360
and to come for their own home,

38:31.360 --> 38:36.000
Cold Stone Creamery now offers a line of grab and go creations

38:36.000 --> 38:38.080
available in the store display freezer.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.160
Ice cream aficionados across the country

38:40.160 --> 38:42.160
are raving about the new grab and go flavor,

38:42.160 --> 38:45.200
Choc-a-cone made with crunchy sugarcane pieces.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.240
Gosh, I'm luxurious.

38:48.880 --> 38:51.120
Uh oh, sounds like Justin needs a frozen Mountain Dew

38:51.120 --> 38:51.920
pick me up.

38:51.920 --> 38:52.720
Oh, he's parched.

38:52.720 --> 38:54.720
Yeah, I'm parched.

38:55.600 --> 38:56.400
I'm parched.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.480
Hey, I'd fuck up a Mountain Dew smoothie.

38:59.440 --> 39:02.240
But not a slushie, to be clear, a smoothie.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.600
Yeah, that means they got yogurt or kale in there.

39:05.600 --> 39:08.080
Yeah, I don't care for that idea at all.

39:08.080 --> 39:13.600
At the Tees, we used to offer an item where we would mix

39:14.320 --> 39:16.640
like a sherbert with Sprite,

39:16.640 --> 39:19.520
blend that up in the mixing machine and serve that up.

39:19.520 --> 39:23.200
And one day I came in and I did have like a one liter bottle

39:23.200 --> 39:26.960
of the Dew and I was like, hey, what about this?

39:26.960 --> 39:29.760
I mixed that shit up and I drank it.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.240
And then I was just at a LAN party.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.520
Like I just was at a LAN party after that.

39:36.240 --> 39:36.740
Amazing.

39:36.740 --> 39:39.860
Um, you got, um, just real quick.

39:39.860 --> 39:43.300
I had something, I hate to butt up against Justin's thing,

39:43.300 --> 39:44.180
but um-

39:44.180 --> 39:45.380
Then don't, then wait, wait, wait.

39:45.380 --> 39:46.100
Oh, hello.

39:46.100 --> 39:47.140
Then wait, you haven't done it yet.

39:47.140 --> 39:48.580
You haven't, fuck.

39:48.580 --> 39:51.380
I was just about to give my brothers a bit of a quiz,

39:51.380 --> 39:54.980
but if you'd like, you're welcome to play along at home.

39:54.980 --> 39:56.660
I don't want, hey, check this out.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.100
Hey, I've never done this before.

39:58.100 --> 39:59.300
I don't want to.

39:59.300 --> 40:01.140
I think you'll really enjoy this one, Griffin.

40:01.140 --> 40:03.540
I've, I've tailored questions for both of you.

40:04.180 --> 40:04.660
Sure, sure, sure.

40:04.660 --> 40:05.780
I think you'll really enjoy this.

40:05.780 --> 40:06.980
No, but check this out.

40:06.980 --> 40:07.780
Check this out.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.380
I'm not going, I'm not gonna.

40:09.940 --> 40:10.420
Okay.

40:10.420 --> 40:11.940
Well, Justin, I'll start with you then.

40:12.740 --> 40:13.140
Great.

40:13.140 --> 40:14.180
Looking forward to it, Trav.

40:14.740 --> 40:16.500
Give him my questions too.

40:16.500 --> 40:17.220
Oh, okay.

40:17.220 --> 40:18.180
You got it.

40:18.180 --> 40:21.300
In the Carly Rae Jepsen song, I Really Like You,

40:21.300 --> 40:26.340
she sings about really, really, really, really, really, really liking someone.

40:26.340 --> 40:29.380
What actor is featured in the music video for this song?

40:30.020 --> 40:31.300
This baby bullshit.

40:32.100 --> 40:34.260
Um, let me remember.

40:34.260 --> 40:35.140
Don't look it up.

40:35.140 --> 40:35.860
Do not look it up.

40:35.860 --> 40:37.380
I'm not looking, I'm not looking it up.

40:37.380 --> 40:37.860
Let me think.

40:39.140 --> 40:40.180
Judd Hirsch.

40:40.180 --> 40:41.220
Incorrect.

40:41.220 --> 40:43.220
The answer is Tom Hanks.

40:43.220 --> 40:44.740
Nope, it's Judd Hirsch.

40:44.740 --> 40:45.540
Justin's right.

40:46.340 --> 40:48.180
Now, Griffin, I'll go ahead and give you Justin's questions.

40:48.180 --> 40:48.820
Where did you get?

40:48.820 --> 40:50.580
I don't know where you got your information, Travis,

40:50.580 --> 40:54.420
but Judd Hirsch was the subject of Carly's affection in that video.

40:55.540 --> 40:56.660
So, Griffin.

40:56.660 --> 40:57.220
Excuse me.

40:57.780 --> 40:58.740
I'm winning, Justin.

40:58.740 --> 40:59.380
Do you hear that?

40:59.380 --> 41:00.340
He's dying.

41:00.340 --> 41:01.060
Do you hear it?

41:01.060 --> 41:01.620
Oh, we're destroying his will.

41:01.620 --> 41:05.620
In the 1996 FMV classic, The Seventh Guest,

41:05.620 --> 41:08.660
you play a disembodied consciousness that moves through the house,

41:08.660 --> 41:12.740
solving puzzles and observing the events of that mysterious night

41:12.740 --> 41:15.940
at Stolf's house as they unfolded long ago.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.380
What is your character's name?

41:18.180 --> 41:20.740
Dave Thomas.

41:20.740 --> 41:21.060
Is that-

41:23.380 --> 41:24.180
Dave Thomas.

41:24.180 --> 41:25.940
It was a Wendy's only.

41:25.940 --> 41:28.260
It came in The Happy Meals, I believe.

41:28.260 --> 41:29.300
No, the comedian Dave.

41:29.300 --> 41:30.420
The comedian Dave Thomas.

41:30.420 --> 41:32.420
Oh, that comedian Dave Thomas.

41:32.420 --> 41:33.620
No, the Wendy's one.

41:33.620 --> 41:35.140
It was the Wendy's one.

41:35.140 --> 41:37.140
Now, what do you think is the real answer, Griffin?

41:38.420 --> 41:38.980
Shimmothy.

41:38.980 --> 41:40.020
I don't know, Travis.

41:40.020 --> 41:40.340
Fuck.

41:41.060 --> 41:43.220
Justin, do you know the answer?

41:44.180 --> 41:44.660
Ego.

41:44.660 --> 41:46.020
Ego is correct.

41:46.020 --> 41:52.340
Justin, in the song Boy Problems, co-written by, among others, Sia,

41:52.340 --> 41:56.340
Jepsen reveals that she has very recently broken up with her boyfriend.

41:56.340 --> 42:01.060
In the music video for the song, what iconic hairstyle does Jepsen sport?

42:03.060 --> 42:03.300
Bob.

42:04.580 --> 42:06.260
Griffin, do you know the answer?

42:06.260 --> 42:08.020
No, I was asking my friend Bob.

42:08.020 --> 42:10.340
Hold on, he doesn't know.

42:11.140 --> 42:12.260
Griffin, do you know?

42:12.260 --> 42:15.380
I mean, she had the short dark hair in that one, like the Liza.

42:15.380 --> 42:15.860
The Liza Minnelli hair.

42:15.860 --> 42:16.820
It's a mullet.

42:17.460 --> 42:18.500
A mullet?

42:18.500 --> 42:19.460
A mullet.

42:19.460 --> 42:19.780
Yes.

42:20.260 --> 42:21.060
Okay.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.180
This feels wrong, too.

42:23.060 --> 42:23.700
That's correct.

42:23.700 --> 42:29.300
No, man, mine was right, and Justin, so far, Justin, I'm giving you Travis's points,

42:29.300 --> 42:32.740
which I don't even know how that works, but I'm still hung up on Judd Hirsch.

42:34.100 --> 42:37.300
All right, Justin, one last one here.

42:37.300 --> 42:46.020
The 2018 Jepsen bop, Party for One, became an instant self-care slash masturbation anthem.

42:46.020 --> 42:47.460
The music video begins with-

42:47.460 --> 42:49.300
Those two are synonymous, but go on.

42:49.300 --> 42:53.940
The music video begins with a hotel desk clerk performing what strange act?

42:56.020 --> 42:57.140
Masturbating.

42:57.140 --> 42:58.020
Correct.

42:58.020 --> 42:58.820
Griffin, do you know?

42:58.820 --> 43:00.020
All I know-

43:00.020 --> 43:02.340
There's nothing strange about masturbation, Justin.

43:03.540 --> 43:04.660
Well, it would be strange.

43:04.660 --> 43:10.500
I mean, anything could be strange, given enough context, Travis, and I think that a hotel clerk

43:10.500 --> 43:16.740
in his little cap and uniform masturbating would be quite strange.

43:16.740 --> 43:20.660
Well, you say that, but Darling Nikki was in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine.

43:22.340 --> 43:23.140
So there.

43:23.140 --> 43:24.420
Griffin, do you know the answer?

43:25.380 --> 43:29.940
It's masturbating, and it was Judd Hirsch, the first answer.

43:29.940 --> 43:31.060
It is incorrect.

43:31.060 --> 43:33.300
They face plant into a loaf of bread.

43:37.940 --> 43:40.580
So I think the winner is Griffin.

43:40.580 --> 43:41.300
All right.

43:41.300 --> 43:42.020
What?

43:42.020 --> 43:43.860
Well, maybe it's Ty, because you knew Ego.

43:43.860 --> 43:50.100
I'm giving Justin one of my points for that Judd Hirsch answer, man.

43:50.100 --> 43:52.500
I still think he got fucking ripped on that.

43:53.780 --> 43:54.100
All right.

43:54.100 --> 43:55.700
The winner is Justin.

43:55.700 --> 43:56.100
Yeah.

43:56.100 --> 43:56.900
I won.

43:56.900 --> 43:57.780
Hooray.

43:57.780 --> 43:58.420
Here's another question.

43:58.420 --> 43:58.980
No, here's another question.

43:58.980 --> 43:59.940
Do you want to do Yahoo?

43:59.940 --> 44:01.060
This one was sent in by Michelle.

44:01.060 --> 44:01.620
Thanks, Michelle.

44:01.620 --> 44:05.700
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user, because everybody on Yahoo is a chicken shit these days,

44:05.700 --> 44:06.100
I guess.

44:06.100 --> 44:09.380
Back in my day, people would put their fucking name on shit.

44:09.380 --> 44:18.660
But Denise asks, is it possible that someone has looked at a mummy or skeleton in a museum

44:18.660 --> 44:21.540
that was their great, great, great, and so on, grandparent?

44:22.340 --> 44:27.220
I went to a museum some time ago, and there was a couple of mummies that were buried together

44:27.220 --> 44:28.420
in the Stone Age or so.

44:28.980 --> 44:33.060
I know it sounds weird, but I felt a really strong connection to them.

44:33.060 --> 44:34.340
They felt like family.

44:34.340 --> 44:35.620
I got so sad.

44:35.620 --> 44:40.020
Is it even possible that they were related to me?

44:40.020 --> 44:40.520
Huh.

44:41.380 --> 44:42.500
Is it possible?

44:43.220 --> 44:44.500
Is it possible?

44:44.500 --> 44:46.260
Yeah, it's possible, right?

44:46.260 --> 44:48.660
I mean, Stone Age mummies are not possible.

44:48.660 --> 44:50.020
That's probably not right.

44:50.020 --> 44:51.380
That's not right.

44:51.380 --> 44:56.500
But back in mummy times, there were only like 100 people on Earth.

44:56.500 --> 44:57.620
Yeah, there weren't that many.

44:58.340 --> 44:58.820
Yeah, right?

44:59.540 --> 45:01.460
Because you got Adam and Eve, right?

45:01.460 --> 45:05.540
Yeah, and then you got Cain and Abel, and then it's a little fuzzy for me for a while.

45:06.100 --> 45:06.660
Yeah.

45:06.660 --> 45:07.620
How that worked out.

45:08.500 --> 45:13.140
I really enjoy the idea that this question asker is in a museum, and they're looking

45:13.140 --> 45:18.340
at some mummies, and they're like, oh my god, I feel an incredible, incredible connection

45:18.340 --> 45:19.140
to these mummies.

45:20.340 --> 45:23.300
I think that I might be related to these mummies.

45:23.300 --> 45:25.460
I wonder when these mummies are from.

45:25.460 --> 45:27.540
The plaque is three feet away from them.

45:28.260 --> 45:29.220
Fuck, I don't know.

45:29.220 --> 45:30.980
Probably the Stone Age or some shit.

45:30.980 --> 45:33.140
Anyway, I got to go get on Yahoo about this one.

45:34.420 --> 45:37.860
And if you look, see how they kind of have like a head and body?

45:37.860 --> 45:39.300
I have a head and body too.

45:40.180 --> 45:41.620
That's just like me.

45:41.620 --> 45:42.980
We're the same animal.

45:42.980 --> 45:45.780
So like, I know that they are probably my great, great.

45:46.660 --> 45:48.500
Let's figure out how many greats it is.

45:48.500 --> 45:52.660
Because I want to say like four or five.

45:52.660 --> 45:54.580
It's not as many as you think it's going to be.

45:55.300 --> 46:00.740
And I think it's fucked up actually that there are mummies in museums.

46:00.740 --> 46:01.940
Because that's a dead body.

46:02.820 --> 46:03.140
Sure.

46:03.140 --> 46:04.260
No one ever talks about that.

46:04.260 --> 46:10.500
But like, do you think that docents at museums are like, when kids come in, they walk up

46:10.500 --> 46:14.420
to the kids are like, hey, kids, you want to see a dead body?

46:16.980 --> 46:19.300
Because it is a dead person in there.

46:19.300 --> 46:20.100
I'm assuming.

46:21.460 --> 46:25.700
I mean, more museums should advertise like when they have those mummy tours.

46:25.700 --> 46:29.540
They should just have a huge banner that's like, hey, kids, dead folks.

46:29.540 --> 46:31.220
You guys want to see a dead body?

46:31.220 --> 46:34.740
Back in my day, I didn't want to go to a museum that had a mummy in it for fear that it would

46:34.740 --> 46:39.220
come to life and suck all of my vital organs out of my body like the movie showed me that

46:39.220 --> 46:40.180
they could do.

46:40.180 --> 46:44.500
When really, I shouldn't have gone to see them because it is dead bodies.

46:44.500 --> 46:47.540
I hope nobody digs up my dead ass and puts me on.

46:47.540 --> 46:48.420
I disagree.

46:49.220 --> 46:49.620
Okay.

46:50.340 --> 46:51.140
Here's the thing.

46:52.260 --> 46:55.540
They're going to leave me in the ground for no one to even think about?

46:56.260 --> 46:56.740
And enjoy?

46:56.740 --> 46:58.740
Enjoy?

46:58.740 --> 47:06.020
Listen, I don't want to be one of the ones that gets eaten to cure rickets or whatever.

47:06.020 --> 47:12.340
I want to be one of the ones that's put in a well lit, gotta be well lit, like wing of

47:12.340 --> 47:17.540
a museum for people to be like, dang, I bet he was important or else he wouldn't be here.

47:18.180 --> 47:19.540
That's a good point, Travis.

47:19.540 --> 47:20.580
You're enjoying it.

47:20.580 --> 47:21.700
People want to enjoy you.

47:21.700 --> 47:21.940
Thank you.

47:21.940 --> 47:23.300
You want people to be enjoyed.

47:24.020 --> 47:24.740
You know what?

47:24.740 --> 47:25.380
No case.

47:25.380 --> 47:26.900
Let him touch me.

47:26.900 --> 47:27.700
Yeah.

47:27.700 --> 47:28.580
Let him find out.

47:29.540 --> 47:30.980
No case, good lighting.

47:34.260 --> 47:37.540
That's the thing, I see the mummy now and I'm like, I want to touch it.

47:39.220 --> 47:40.500
A limited engagement.

47:41.220 --> 47:44.660
Come experience Travis McElroy the way he was meant to be enjoyed.

47:44.660 --> 47:46.100
Touch Travis while he lasts.

47:46.740 --> 47:48.580
Good lighting, no case.

47:48.580 --> 47:53.620
Listen, the oils on your human hands are going to wear away at his old, old body.

47:53.620 --> 47:55.620
So like, come and get a touch.

47:55.620 --> 47:56.980
First come, first serve.

47:57.620 --> 47:59.860
All the flash photography you want, baby.

48:01.620 --> 48:02.580
Don't worry about it.

48:03.140 --> 48:04.420
Be there while it lasts.

48:04.420 --> 48:07.060
Travis was a limited engagement, but he's back now.

48:08.020 --> 48:08.900
For a little bit.

48:08.900 --> 48:09.700
For a little bit.

48:10.820 --> 48:12.820
No food and drinks in the Travis ch-

48:12.820 --> 48:14.820
All right, you can bring your food and drinks in.

48:14.820 --> 48:17.460
Spill some Mountain Dew on him, see if he wakes up.

48:18.660 --> 48:21.540
Dump a Dew Iced on his head, see if it's enough to invigorate him.

48:21.540 --> 48:22.040
He's back.

48:22.040 --> 48:22.540
He's back.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.280
He's back.

48:24.280 --> 48:26.600
Do museums have skeletons in them?

48:26.600 --> 48:27.880
I don't think they do, right?

48:28.680 --> 48:29.400
They do, sure they do.

48:29.400 --> 48:33.960
They got dinosaur skeletons, but they don't have human skeletons, do they?

48:33.960 --> 48:36.040
Dinosaurs were the humans of their day, Griffin.

48:36.600 --> 48:38.040
And they're not skeletons.

48:38.040 --> 48:42.920
It's like rocks saying what they thought the bones look like if they remembered correctly.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.320
Whoa, Justin, that was fucked up, what you said.

48:46.200 --> 48:48.120
It's the truth.

48:48.120 --> 48:51.400
I have recently, as I've been playing Animal Crossing and Dig Up Fossils

48:51.400 --> 48:53.400
and PB's been like, what are fossils?

48:53.400 --> 48:54.920
And I've been explaining to her.

48:54.920 --> 48:57.000
And then she asked like how the dinosaurs died.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.880
And as I was explaining, you know, meteor hit the earth and all that stuff.

48:59.880 --> 49:05.480
She started to get very upset and not because of the idea of that.

49:05.480 --> 49:08.760
But like when I said like, you know, the sky's darkened and then they didn't have food to eat.

49:08.760 --> 49:10.920
She was like, oh my God, I bet they were so hungry.

49:10.920 --> 49:13.960
And she was like really upset on the dinosaurs behalf.

49:13.960 --> 49:14.760
And you know what?

49:14.760 --> 49:18.200
I've never thought about it that way, but it's pretty fucked up, right?

49:18.200 --> 49:19.800
They were just like, yeah, they're dead.

49:19.800 --> 49:21.400
Could never happen to us.

49:21.400 --> 49:23.480
Yeah, I'm glad they're fucking gone.

49:23.480 --> 49:26.200
Think about how sharp their teeth are and how powerful the talons.

49:26.200 --> 49:27.800
Yeah, I guess that's true.

49:27.800 --> 49:28.920
Do I need that?

49:28.920 --> 49:31.160
My life's hard enough with the quarantine and all.

49:31.160 --> 49:33.800
I don't want to get stomped on by an Apatosaurus or something.

49:34.680 --> 49:37.400
Do you think, wouldn't it be cool if the dinosaurs were like,

49:37.400 --> 49:39.400
hey, I hear this is all over blood.

49:39.400 --> 49:41.080
You guys should come back out.

49:41.080 --> 49:42.120
It's totally cool.

49:42.920 --> 49:44.200
It's a fucking hoax, dude.

49:44.200 --> 49:47.160
Come on out, it's fine, we're loving it out here.

49:47.160 --> 49:51.160
You're dinosaurs are immune, I know that no, no, no, I had it already.

49:51.160 --> 49:51.640
It's fine.

49:51.640 --> 49:52.040
Come on.

49:52.040 --> 49:53.160
Even that bad, really?

49:53.720 --> 49:54.920
It's not even really that bad.

49:54.920 --> 49:56.840
It's like as bad as the dinosaur flu.

49:56.840 --> 49:59.320
You all died from the dinosaur flu.

49:59.320 --> 50:02.760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

50:02.760 --> 50:05.240
That's pretty, listen, man, it's ancient history.

50:05.240 --> 50:06.440
It's before history.

50:06.440 --> 50:10.040
In fact, thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

50:10.040 --> 50:11.480
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

50:11.480 --> 50:14.280
We hope you're hanging in there, staying safe.

50:14.280 --> 50:21.720
The whole bit, we got some new stuff on our merch store, I think.

50:21.720 --> 50:24.680
It's McElroyMerch.com.

50:24.680 --> 50:30.200
In addition to our ill-advised 10th anniversary commemorative plate, new t-shirts.

50:32.120 --> 50:36.280
We've got some stickers to get that summertime vibe going.

50:37.560 --> 50:41.080
And a t-shirt for Griffin and my video game podcast, The Besties.

50:41.080 --> 50:44.440
So that's worth checking out if you're so inclined.

50:44.440 --> 50:51.160
Real quick, I wanted to make, I wanted to mention the podcast I do with my wife called Shmanners.

50:51.160 --> 50:59.320
Last week's episode is a special all about video conferencing and teleconferencing etiquette.

50:59.320 --> 51:03.800
And we got a bunch of questions about it and did our best to answer those.

51:03.800 --> 51:06.440
So if that's something you've been worried about, you can check that out.

51:06.440 --> 51:14.280
And the week before that, I talked about a historical figure named Joshua Norton,

51:14.280 --> 51:20.760
who is a dude who proclaimed himself the first emperor of the United States in the mid 1800s in San Francisco.

51:20.760 --> 51:24.600
And it's one of my favorite topics ever, and I was very excited to talk about it.

51:24.600 --> 51:29.320
And so if that sounds interesting to you at all, either one of those, make sure you go check them out.

51:29.320 --> 51:30.520
I think they're great.

51:30.520 --> 51:34.200
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for these for a theme song.

51:34.200 --> 51:40.600
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed, groove on those funky tunes.

51:40.600 --> 51:41.400
Nice.

51:41.400 --> 51:46.520
And thanks, speaking of funky tunes, thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

51:46.520 --> 51:57.000

51:57.000 --> 52:03.000

52:21.000 --> 52:24.040
That is it, I am going to read the final yahoo now.

52:24.040 --> 52:26.840
Thank you to everyone who sent in yahoo's.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.920
Jack sent this one in though.

52:28.920 --> 52:29.720
Thanks, Jack.

52:29.720 --> 52:32.200
It's from yahoo answers user Negotiate.

52:32.200 --> 52:45.000
Who asks, is it safe to say that the 1880s were just like the 1980s but with less technology?

52:45.000 --> 52:52.520
My name is Justin McElroy.

52:52.520 --> 52:53.800
Travis McElroy.

52:53.800 --> 52:55.240
I'm Griffin McElroy.

52:55.240 --> 52:57.160
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

52:57.160 --> 53:02.600
Kiss your dad square on the lips.
