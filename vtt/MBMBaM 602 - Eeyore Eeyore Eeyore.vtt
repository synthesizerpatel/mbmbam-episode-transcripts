WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:50.060
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:56.060
It's better it's better with you

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better with you

01:10.180 --> 01:17.100
Hello everybody welcome to my brother my brother made a vice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:17.100 --> 01:22.060
I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

01:24.260 --> 01:26.260
Okay

01:26.940 --> 01:34.040
Not haunted doll watch it is a bad movie watch Batman watch Batman's back new another one the newest best Batman yet

01:34.040 --> 01:36.040
They're saying Ben Affleck. Fuck you

01:36.340 --> 01:40.540
Christopher Nolan eat shit idiot cuz this Batman is

01:41.180 --> 01:45.100
The original Batman by which I do mean the Twilight gentlemen

01:45.100 --> 01:47.100
Have the bat

01:48.100 --> 01:49.420
Robert

01:49.420 --> 01:54.020
Rob pats is up in it. He's the new Batman which is funny because he was a Batman

01:54.900 --> 01:56.020
before oh

01:56.020 --> 02:02.860
I see and that's the first joke that that said has been said about that and that's thank you fucking great

02:02.860 --> 02:09.100
That's real quick. I want to highlight something wonderful about Robert Pattinson. I'd love to he recently revealed that

02:09.660 --> 02:13.940
Often in interviews he lies and I didn't know that was a thing you could do

02:13.940 --> 02:18.980
Okay, okay. I didn't know that when an interviewer is like, what are you working on?

02:18.980 --> 02:24.740
I'm like, what's your how's it going? You could just like I'm in six movies or whatever and like nobody checks it

02:24.740 --> 02:30.260
I like when he tried to describe the plot of Final Fantasy 7 to Zoe Kravitz during an interview and she was like

02:31.100 --> 02:34.780
Why do you think why do you think I give a shit about that Rob Pats?

02:35.340 --> 02:39.460
Anyway, he had an interview once that he wanted to open his own spaghetti restaurant

02:39.460 --> 02:44.620
That's good. Yeah, he's having fun out there, but you know who's not having fun Paul Dano

02:46.180 --> 02:48.280
Well, wait Paul Dano is a person

02:49.620 --> 02:52.600
He might be but he's the Riddler this time around which is

02:53.260 --> 02:56.220
Such good casting because when I look at that man, I think

02:56.980 --> 03:00.620
He's got some twisted shit up in there. What a mystery

03:01.860 --> 03:05.260
We're watching him the small yeah

03:05.260 --> 03:11.500
And he was in a skit where he cuz they had Zoe Kravitz the cat woman on there

03:11.500 --> 03:14.460
And he was in a skit where he popped out from underneath the couch

03:15.220 --> 03:19.520
Funny in this skit it is it was funny and he was like, I don't know. I don't know what he said

03:19.520 --> 03:25.540
He had a joke. I'm looking for change. Let's just say he said that and my wife Sydney Smurl McElroy who is not

03:26.980 --> 03:31.460
Super duper plugged in. Yeah culture said who's that?

03:31.460 --> 03:35.240
I I can't I don't mean it's Paul Dano, right obviously

03:35.240 --> 03:40.100
Yeah, but it must have been so weird to have someone pop out from underneath the couch

03:40.220 --> 03:45.420
Yeah, that you don't know who it is for like why is that man? Why is that Paul Dano look?

03:45.420 --> 03:51.500
Yeah, I love Paul Dano doesn't look like a lot of the people you would see on Saturday Night Live or television or the big

03:51.500 --> 03:52.300
movie screen

03:52.300 --> 03:59.020
But he's having a tough time of it because he is playing Riddler and he did an interview and we're talking about a lot of interviews

03:59.020 --> 04:05.020
But this is an important one because he was talking about how the Riddler playing him and inhabiting him and being him

04:05.540 --> 04:07.540
Fucked him up

04:10.040 --> 04:14.380
He said he said there were some nights around that

04:14.380 --> 04:19.380
I probably didn't sleep as well as I would have wanted to because it was a little hard to come down from the character takes

04:19.380 --> 04:21.700
Oh my god takes a lot of energy to get there

04:21.700 --> 04:25.620
and so you almost have to sustain it once you're there because going up and down is kind of hard and

04:25.620 --> 04:33.020
What what I felt was the opportunity that director Matt Reeves was giving with a villain in this film was more real potentially more terrifying

04:33.260 --> 04:35.260
My head was just throbbing with heat

04:35.660 --> 04:38.980
He said later about being encased in plastic wrap. I

04:39.540 --> 04:43.660
Went home that night after the first day and I couldn't sleep because I was scared of what was happening in my head

04:49.060 --> 04:54.780
Riddles where there weren't riddles the guy asked me if I wanted paper plastic I was like, oh what a conundrum

04:54.780 --> 05:00.540
I think that if the next Batman director comes to you and is like, hey, man

05:00.980 --> 05:07.580
Huge you're gonna be calendar man in this one. You should probably just say no fucking way. No doing it

05:07.580 --> 05:13.700
I'll do other I'll do other acting shit because those won't fuck with my head and make my head all hot

05:13.700 --> 05:16.100
So I can't sleep. Are you kidding me?

05:16.780 --> 05:20.300
There's a time where Danny DeVito's like I can't get the penguin out

05:20.300 --> 05:26.300
I'm more penguin than Danny DeVito at this point. He was a pleasant man before the penguin happened

05:26.300 --> 05:32.060
And now and now she'll tank Chris because the Riddler I mean the penguin didn't make his head so hot

05:32.740 --> 05:33.900
fire I

05:33.900 --> 05:39.980
Also, just want to take this second to apologize to everybody who I ruined the Batman for yes

05:39.980 --> 05:45.740
Because they watch it in the Riddler's in and all they think of his room. He pissed. Yeah. Sorry. This was not my intention

05:45.740 --> 05:51.460
I apologize to the default, you know, right? I know family the sure and family

05:51.460 --> 05:53.580
Well, I the whole day and family

05:53.580 --> 05:58.620
I feel like that if he does he is a serial murderer in the film though, and I do feel like if you know

05:59.180 --> 06:06.380
Yeah, and if you murder a lot of people and ask some riddles here in there, they should call you the murderer

06:06.380 --> 06:12.060
The murderer who does riddles

06:12.380 --> 06:17.460
Yeah, maybe maybe like the question mark murderer maybe or like murderer

06:17.580 --> 06:21.340
No, I was gonna say murderer question mark, but that implies some ambiguity

06:21.340 --> 06:24.500
It does you're are kind of burying the lead a bit

06:24.500 --> 06:28.420
The thing you have to know about this guy is he loves conundrums and delicious

06:29.060 --> 06:33.340
Fun. Yeah, there's also a little bit of murder on a lot of it

06:33.340 --> 06:35.340
Oh

06:35.460 --> 06:37.880
See murder more than he asks riddles. Yeah

06:39.780 --> 06:45.360
Zodiac Puzzle, man, they did. Yeah, that's you know, I mean, they're not is the code boy code master

06:47.540 --> 06:49.540
First the killer

06:52.140 --> 06:58.540
All of the Batman films should be murderer brackets riddles murderer brackets clown theme

06:58.540 --> 07:05.540
It's weird it's weird that I want one Batman that does is like I'm not doing the bullshit

07:05.980 --> 07:12.380
You don't do riddles. You're a murderer. I'm the riddler. I'm not calling you that. Oh the one with birds

07:12.380 --> 07:18.100
I'm not playing around. I'm I'm so busy. Do you think I have fucking time? I'm really busy

07:19.100 --> 07:24.060
Batman what can you put in a barrel to make it lighter? You're strangling someone, right?

07:24.060 --> 07:29.620
I'm gonna stop you strangling him for a moan and then we can address the riddle

07:29.620 --> 07:35.140
You've asked me the answer is a hole. I read this one in highlights when I was eight, please stop strangling the chief

07:36.580 --> 07:38.580
Chief are you cool?

07:41.580 --> 07:44.820
Give me a second. I was gonna get there. I

07:45.460 --> 07:49.280
Want to do it on my own as we another one the doctor was his mom

07:49.280 --> 07:53.960
Fuck fuck being strangled socks stop him. He's

07:59.400 --> 08:02.040
But Batman's doing great

08:04.040 --> 08:07.920
Well, can I just say that it does confuse me a little bit it surprises me

08:07.920 --> 08:12.520
Oh, because we've had a lot of Batman films we have

08:13.120 --> 08:17.680
There's been a lot of Batman films and it it is weird to me because this one

08:17.680 --> 08:19.800
Happens to be three

08:20.920 --> 08:22.920
God damn hours

08:24.440 --> 08:29.720
I don't understand. Listen, I'm a I'm a nerdy guy in his early 40s

08:30.080 --> 08:37.240
Like I should be target demo, right? But by the same turn, I don't know how many chunks of three hours I have

08:37.920 --> 08:43.680
Ahead of me and I'm very surprised at so much. The American populace is like Batman. Let's go

08:43.680 --> 08:47.900
I'll take three hours of that. Sure. Let's go three hours of the bat. I love it

08:47.900 --> 08:52.360
Give me a he's three hours though. It is weird to think that it occurred to me

08:53.040 --> 08:57.560
We have more living actors who have portrayed Batman

08:58.400 --> 09:00.720
than there are living presidents and

09:01.200 --> 09:05.360
That is wild to me in my lifetime in one generation. Yeah

09:06.520 --> 09:12.900
Presidents keep fucking beefing though, don't they? Yeah, but like so we got seven if you include the

09:12.900 --> 09:17.100
Prominent voice actors, but yeah, we've got seven

09:17.860 --> 09:19.460
Batman's

09:19.460 --> 09:26.300
Well, but that man film is can't push back against something the Batman film is rated pg-13 and he's a serial killer

09:26.300 --> 09:33.180
So wait, man is no the Riddler. How does that portray like? Well, I oops a lot of people

09:34.500 --> 09:36.660
I solved a lot of people

09:36.660 --> 09:43.020
I unlocked their chests my gun key

09:43.940 --> 09:45.940
This is getting too grizzly

09:46.220 --> 09:48.220
for pg-13

09:49.180 --> 09:51.480
Those people I can't tell you

09:52.660 --> 09:56.820
I really can't I don't know what happens after death

09:58.260 --> 10:00.260
The afterlife is the greatest

10:02.020 --> 10:06.640
I thought for a second just like you they were saying that Batman was a serial killer in this movie

10:06.640 --> 10:08.820
And I was gonna be like, well that is a gritty term, huh?

10:09.100 --> 10:14.480
That would be a weird change if the Riddler looked at Batman like you have to calm it down

10:15.020 --> 10:20.540
I love I love Mack McElroy and but the man's been texting me and he's like

10:20.980 --> 10:25.300
You want to do Batman today and like guys I do legitimately have

10:26.060 --> 10:29.740
Like even when I do have a very little bit of free time

10:29.740 --> 10:36.780
Yeah, I just can't sit down for three hours and watch Batman. Here's what we need

10:36.780 --> 10:39.820
It's pretend. Do you know that? Yeah, I've been thinking about this

10:41.140 --> 10:43.680
I got the two kids and finding a window of time

10:44.140 --> 10:48.660
Where I can go watch a pg-13 movie even for three hours is impossible

10:48.660 --> 10:54.180
So here's what I recommend movie theaters sell special old folks tickets for 38 year olds like me

10:54.180 --> 11:00.380
Where I can watch it an hour at a time, right and then I pop back in for hour two on another day

11:00.380 --> 11:05.260
I pop back in for hour three on a different day and you like punch holes in it just show like oh don't let him in

11:05.260 --> 11:11.180
For our one he's already watched that one and let me watch it in three chunks because the chances that I will that my window

11:11.180 --> 11:13.460
of time that I have three hours three free and

11:14.420 --> 11:20.980
Three hours worth of energy and interest in my body that will never align that will never happen

11:20.980 --> 11:25.180
We're so please let me watch the movie in chunks or just let me watch it at home

11:25.460 --> 11:29.260
Cuz we've been doing that the last two years. It's pretty great. You guys good guys

11:29.260 --> 11:35.100
Like we get it like is bed. You gotta see the big worm when it's big

11:35.380 --> 11:40.140
Yeah, but I'd rather see it small than not see it because it

11:40.900 --> 11:43.700
Does dune have a paw patrol timothy chalamet?

11:43.700 --> 11:47.420
It doesn't then I can't actually go see it on the big silver screen

11:47.420 --> 11:52.060
Unless you put it picture and picture on the big silver screen and the big picture is ball patrol

11:52.060 --> 11:56.660
I'm the little pictures dude, and I have one headphone in and the other one out so I can go

11:56.660 --> 12:00.260
Oh, yeah, buddy. Oh, yeah. Oh more popcorn. Can we pause dune?

12:00.620 --> 12:06.160
Yeah, we pause dune so I can go get my child more popcorn because they dumped theirs on the seat in front of them like

12:06.420 --> 12:08.300
idiot

12:08.300 --> 12:11.540
Anyway, that may get there three hours

12:12.220 --> 12:13.980
Having fun with our friends

12:13.980 --> 12:19.280
Get their best three hours non-stop to me. I bet there's no fat on no

12:19.740 --> 12:22.900
On that definitely not all we know

12:24.060 --> 12:25.340
definitely

12:25.340 --> 12:32.180
What do you think the odds are it is the first reboot of an of a new Batman franchise, right?

12:32.180 --> 12:35.500
And so what are the eyes wait since when Griffin?

12:35.780 --> 12:42.980
because like the first reboot in the most the most recent reboot of the Batman franchise does it end with like and

12:42.980 --> 12:44.300
you

12:44.300 --> 12:45.980
hear like

12:45.980 --> 12:49.580
The Riddler gets, you know blown up or whatever by Batman's cool

12:51.380 --> 12:56.940
Missile launcher or something Batman Batman stabs him and kills him but then in his pocket, what does he find?

12:56.940 --> 12:58.100
It's not a riddle

12:58.100 --> 13:03.540
It's a picture of a clown because Joker is the next one like it's got to be something like that where it's like

13:03.540 --> 13:06.420
Oh, I've decided to move on from riddles now

13:06.420 --> 13:11.740
I'm doing jokes and then in the next movie Paul Dano's gonna play the Joker and he's gonna be

13:11.740 --> 13:17.660
We can't recover from we won't be able to salvage Paul Dano after that

13:19.020 --> 13:24.780
There will be too many broken pieces of Paul Dano to try to glue him back together if he plays the Riddler and the Joker

13:26.100 --> 13:29.820
They should let him play Batman next to balance it out. Yes

13:29.820 --> 13:34.540
I know like Superman let him play somebody who's like super light and fluffy next

13:34.540 --> 13:42.340
Okay, and it's just like if you play a Batman villain in a great Batman movie next you get to be like Captain

13:42.340 --> 13:43.380
Shazam

13:43.380 --> 13:45.380
Shazam, there you go

13:46.300 --> 13:51.100
Fucking Levi or whatever his name is like every day rolled up the set like

13:51.980 --> 13:55.180
How you doing there Zach? Pretty good, man. I'm Shazam

13:55.180 --> 14:03.020
I'm Shazam, I got nothing to worry about. Are you sure you're in the right headspace to play Shazam? You got I just won Mario Kart

14:03.020 --> 14:05.020
I'm in a great good headspace

14:05.260 --> 14:10.020
Paul are you okay? You look like shit. No, man. I couldn't sleep last night the riddles made my head so hot

14:10.660 --> 14:14.900
Here just take a break playing Mario Kart. I can't don't you understand?

14:14.900 --> 14:20.100
I can't, but to turn my mind away from the riddles for a moment is to betray my sacred charge

14:21.140 --> 14:23.140
anyway, despite I

14:23.140 --> 14:28.300
Listen a lot of people were hoping the walking Phoenix Joker would show up

14:28.300 --> 14:34.620
Oh, that's what it isn't then you walking Phoenix like fucking moonwalks onto the screen during the credits like

14:35.340 --> 14:37.340
Catch you next time bats

14:37.620 --> 14:42.780
But I have an article here from Game Rant that explains why it can't possibly happen

14:42.780 --> 14:47.140
Oh shit, I want to run through just so you guys are prepared for the different. Okay

14:47.140 --> 14:53.460
so in 2019's Joker the Joker does not even face Batman and in fact

14:53.540 --> 14:57.780
Operates in a Gotham City that appears to be without the caped crusader. I have noticed that

14:57.780 --> 15:00.900
Yeah, that is that yeah, you notice how Batman's not in it

15:00.900 --> 15:05.220
I did not actually reference Bruce Wayne as a young boy. So that's that they don't have one

15:05.220 --> 15:08.540
So here's the first problem high tech versus no tech. Oh, yeah

15:09.460 --> 15:16.180
He has he has a bat being a billionaire gives one access to technology that the rest simply cannot yeah

15:16.180 --> 15:20.820
Wait, hey, sorry article writer. I'm sure that there's some good insight in here

15:20.860 --> 15:21.580
But yeah

15:21.580 --> 15:28.580
You've just summarized the whole point of Batman as a superhero in the Batman's new trailer Batman uses one of his gauntlets to electrocute

15:28.580 --> 15:30.500
And take down the enemy combatant

15:30.500 --> 15:33.460
Conversely Joaquin Phoenix Joker barely knows how to shoot a gun

15:33.460 --> 15:33.900
Yeah

15:33.900 --> 15:37.860
If the two were to meet in combat the fight would be over with one use of Batman's grappling hook

15:38.140 --> 15:44.280
Batarangs or a few punches the scene would barely be enough to fit a trailer let alone an entire film next bullet point

15:44.280 --> 15:49.000
Batman can fight the Joker cannot. Yeah. Yeah, that's a great point to shit

15:49.000 --> 15:55.800
I didn't you almost never is there a scene where Batman and the Joker fucking Duke?

15:57.040 --> 16:02.160
Phoenix's Joker is easily kicked to the ground by three smug civilians in white-collar clothing

16:02.160 --> 16:08.080
How would this iteration of the Joker fight against the greatest melee tactician in Gotham City? He simply would not

16:08.680 --> 16:10.500
next point

16:10.500 --> 16:17.280
Batman is young and physically fit the gym the Joker is older and not physically fit

16:17.280 --> 16:20.440
Yeah, the Batman would kick the Joker's ass

16:21.680 --> 16:24.120
Can I read here's another interview with?

16:25.800 --> 16:33.520
Allergic to Batman here's one with here's an interview with Joaquin Phoenix or he's talking about playing the Joker as humans were so malleable

16:33.520 --> 16:38.080
It's probably how we survive and just and adapt when making a movie my whole life changes. I go to a new city

16:38.080 --> 16:41.480
I'm living in a new place. I don't have any photos from home or anything that reminds me of my life

16:41.480 --> 16:46.520
I don't know that you I don't know that you know how it changes you or whether it does

16:46.520 --> 16:53.720
But I certainly don't have any great actor stories about having nightmares or stuff like that. Honestly, I had so much fun making this

16:54.200 --> 16:56.200
meanwhile Paul Dano

16:58.840 --> 17:06.400
So hot his pants are so wet from nightmare piss is someone stopping Joaquin Phoenix from bringing photos of home

17:06.400 --> 17:12.640
Yes, you could take him off the chain and just turn that dog

17:14.520 --> 17:19.720
Like I'm in a new city, I don't know anyone I don't have anything that reminds me of my life

17:20.960 --> 17:24.640
I burn I burn my I burn my driver's license

17:24.640 --> 17:31.720
I bury all my clothes in the desert in an unmarked grave that signify the death of the old me basic style of the grid

17:31.720 --> 17:36.680
The last point that I didn't want to touch on from this game

17:37.240 --> 17:41.040
Is that Joaquin Phoenix's iteration of the Joker is not really the Joker. Oh, yeah

17:41.560 --> 17:45.720
Yeah, yeah, I mean he calls himself the Joker and wants everyone to call him the Joker and lives in Gotham City

17:45.720 --> 17:47.720
It does crime

17:48.720 --> 17:54.800
Because it says here the Joker is a character who has a tragic backstory that no one is entirely sure about sure

17:54.800 --> 17:57.640
But eventually he falls into a vat of chemicals while being chased by Batman

17:57.640 --> 18:04.880
I know he emerges physically and mentally warped becoming the Joker. He is not just a clown at face paint. Well, okay

18:05.600 --> 18:10.400
Furthermore Phoenix's Joker is not a criminal mastermind nor an anarchist nor gangster

18:10.480 --> 18:15.200
He is really just a man who has lived a less than ideal life and has some unaddressed issues. Yeah

18:16.160 --> 18:19.880
Didn't see Joker with Joaquin Phoenix, but that does sound like

18:20.840 --> 18:26.600
Sounds like a role you would take I saw it over someone's shoulder on an airplane and I bet that was my takeaway from it

18:26.600 --> 18:33.120
Yeah, cuz there was can I say there was no point where he squirted someone with like acid out of a little pail flower

18:33.320 --> 18:39.040
There was no point what he didn't have like a big mallet that like a bomb came out of or something

18:39.680 --> 18:44.280
And the Batman from what I could see the person in front of me kept like moving their head around

18:44.360 --> 18:46.360
But from what I could see Batman

18:47.000 --> 18:52.560
Only appeared eight times in the movie, but never never as the Batman

18:52.560 --> 18:57.320
It was always someone or I was like that could be Bruce Wayne and it like but he never put on the suit and

18:57.680 --> 19:01.120
But it was like George Clooney was in it. Affleck was in it

19:01.720 --> 19:06.160
Pattinson was in it. They did like it was like a you know in that one scene in Doctor Who where it's like

19:06.160 --> 19:12.240
It's all the doctors. Yeah, it was like it's all the Batman's together. You did dream this what? Yeah

19:13.360 --> 19:18.360
I'm really worried about how long we talked about Batman every morning every morning

19:18.360 --> 19:23.120
I sit inside my friend's car with her and another friend before school

19:24.200 --> 19:30.520
Yeah, it worked. Yeah, the other day when we were getting out of her car to start heading to class

19:30.640 --> 19:32.880
She said autobots roll out

19:33.760 --> 19:37.320
Under her breath. I feel like something's being lost here

19:37.360 --> 19:43.160
Yeah, people listening may not have followed that other day when we were getting out of the car to start heading to class

19:43.160 --> 19:48.800
She said autobots roll out under her breath when she set saw that we noticed

19:48.800 --> 19:52.320
She said that she hadn't meant for us to hear her and she became embarrassed

19:52.600 --> 19:56.300
Mistaking our genuine joy at her statement for laughter at her expense

19:56.800 --> 20:00.600
Even though we've tried to explain that we legitimately liked it. She won't say it again

20:00.800 --> 20:03.880
How could we convince her to say it again or even say it every day?

20:04.160 --> 20:10.320
Or is it better to just leave it and not bother her about it? Have we already ruined it by drawing attention to it?

20:10.320 --> 20:14.120
Yes, I would love to start every morning with my friend saying autobots roll out

20:14.120 --> 20:16.280
But I don't want to press the issue if he'll just annoy her

20:16.360 --> 20:23.280
How can I get her to continue saying it without accidentally putting her in an uncomfortable position that's from anonymous autobot in Orlando

20:23.640 --> 20:29.600
Florida your friend your friend is not Bart Simpson like with great catchphrases

20:30.080 --> 20:34.760
That they say every day every episode to like get the crowd rolling

20:35.280 --> 20:37.280
But why not Griffin?

20:37.280 --> 20:45.400
Mmm. Yeah, why not if I have the chance to be a Bart Simpson ask catchphrase machine that would get

20:45.760 --> 20:51.040
All I'd have to do is say autobots roll out and my friends would just bust the fuck up

20:51.040 --> 20:55.040
Yeah, this is the thing though. It's like yeah, I want to tell you the macro way handling this

20:55.040 --> 20:59.320
It's a perfectly good bit your friend doesn't want anymore. Now. It's your business your bit

20:59.360 --> 21:04.840
You know that this bit works it already crushed right right and they don't want the bit anymore

21:04.840 --> 21:08.200
So that's your bit now you are the one who's like autobots raw

21:08.200 --> 21:12.400
You're the you're the fucking Keurig cup of coffee that's getting everybody's day roll

21:12.400 --> 21:15.200
Oh, you know the good little head jumpstart also McRoy way

21:15.200 --> 21:17.560
Let me tell you how to make it better cuz I'm me

21:18.160 --> 21:21.360
Make it a call and response you say autobots

21:22.280 --> 21:29.480
Right, and then if you do it like that and leave that little look at the end you have to I mean like you just

21:29.480 --> 21:32.780
Have to you're not gonna leave it. Hey, they'll say roll out saving a haircut to

21:32.780 --> 21:38.700
Right exactly autobots roll out right and now it's a thing because what you don't want to do

21:38.700 --> 21:40.540
This is the tricky thing about making it your own bit

21:40.540 --> 21:45.820
Dustin is you don't want to make it seem like you're making it as an in-joke making fun of oh

21:46.780 --> 21:51.540
God Travis is actually a good point. Yes weird cuz now cuz it would be easy what wait

21:54.180 --> 21:58.940
It would be easy for your friend to see it as like well now it's a joke about the fact that I said it now

21:58.940 --> 22:03.540
They're dunking on me. Yes, but if you make it a call and response now, it's saying we're all in this

22:03.660 --> 22:07.140
This is all of us here. This is an exciting thing that the three of us can share

22:07.740 --> 22:12.620
Every morning before we've got to go into miss Dinkins class, which we all know fucking sucks, right?

22:12.620 --> 22:18.100
We can have this one brief moment of joy in our young lives as we all share through this reference

22:18.100 --> 22:20.140
Which if you're going to school, I don't know why

22:20.740 --> 22:25.580
Autobots roll out as a reference any of you get but congratulations on being so fucking cool

22:25.580 --> 22:32.260
I don't think in the Sam Witwicky movies with the Shia LaBeouf

22:32.780 --> 22:37.340
Sam Witwicky, I don't think they ever say Autobots roll out do they guarantee they do

22:37.340 --> 22:40.940
It's got me in like the fifth film though. And he's like, oh, yeah. Yeah ever all is lost

22:40.940 --> 22:42.900
It's right after the all is lost. He's like

22:42.900 --> 22:48.380
Autobots roll out as he dies. Why did you say like he was dying as as he melts?

22:48.380 --> 22:52.380
Oh Autobots

22:52.380 --> 22:54.380
Hey, if I ever saw people doing a call and response

22:54.900 --> 22:58.420
Autobots roll out regardless of where I am or what the situation is

22:58.420 --> 23:04.340
I will I will I will start going to wedgie school to learn how to do it the best I can possibly get out

23:04.340 --> 23:05.940
You would get in the car with them

23:05.940 --> 23:10.780
If there's an empty seat you would hear them and like jump in and be like roll out. I'm part of it, too

23:10.780 --> 23:13.980
I know you Griffin you clearly don't

23:13.980 --> 23:18.100
You would wedgie you would wedgie rather than join

23:19.100 --> 23:25.740
You're what's wrong with society Griffin. I don't think I am actually on this one. I don't think that this is on this one

23:25.740 --> 23:30.660
I don't think it's not I'm not ideal for society in this example, but I don't think I'm the

23:31.420 --> 23:37.780
You know the main cheese. I just got excited because I thought there's probably somewhere someone that sells

23:37.780 --> 23:45.780
Like I can get an autobots like hood ornament. So it looks like my car is a transformer in disguise

23:46.460 --> 23:53.100
And I'm there's no joke here. I'm just really excited about the possibility of this. Okay. Oh, I want it so bad

23:53.740 --> 23:58.180
Imagine what if someone looked at my car and said he's the new sandwich wiki. The wizard is

23:59.020 --> 24:05.620
Shired up off. Are you okay in his throne? He wants us to approach him if yes, can I just real quick?

24:05.620 --> 24:06.740
I want you to

24:06.740 --> 24:11.460
Frank I just want to talk about Peter Cullen real quick. He's the voice actor behind Optimus Prime and

24:12.340 --> 24:18.000
He's very focused a lot of voice actors. They're kind of bouncing all over the place and I got to give a shout out to

24:19.180 --> 24:26.860
To Peter Cullen, I'm gonna read just real quick. I'm just gonna read down his list of credits

24:26.860 --> 24:28.860
Oh, please in recent years, okay

24:28.860 --> 24:35.840
Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime

24:35.880 --> 24:37.180
you're

24:37.180 --> 24:43.000
Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime

24:43.460 --> 24:45.580
OH95

24:45.600 --> 24:47.220
Optimus Prime Optimus Prime

24:47.220 --> 24:52.520
Optimus Prime

24:52.520 --> 24:54.080
Optimus Prime

24:54.080 --> 24:55.240
Optimus Prime

24:55.240 --> 24:57.660
Optimus Prime

24:57.660 --> 24:59.780
Eeyore. Eeyore. Eeyore. Eeyore. Eeyore.

24:59.780 --> 25:01.200
Okay, now it's Prime.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.900
The eeyore has lost all meaning to me now.

25:03.900 --> 25:05.440
Eeyore. Eeyore. Eeyore.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.320
And it's like, an error message in a fancy robot.

25:07.740 --> 25:10.180
Captain Nathaniel Flint, in Treasure Planet.

25:12.340 --> 25:15.020
K-k-k-k-k- combo breaker!

25:16.060 --> 25:18.060
He had a fucking twen- that was in 2002.

25:18.460 --> 25:20.060
Treasure Planet whips ass, by the way.

25:20.060 --> 25:20.560
Yeah.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.220
I saw it for the first time a couple weeks ago.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.620
That movie, fucking- Griffin have you seen Treasure Planet?

25:24.620 --> 25:25.900
Fuck yeah, whips ass, Michael J.

25:25.900 --> 25:26.900
Yeah, whips ass.

25:26.900 --> 25:31.860
Whips ass. Do you think that he got to Captain Nathaniel Flint and he started to do like

25:32.380 --> 25:36.620
Optimus Prime voice and they're like no not that one and he's heard do er and they're like not that one

25:36.620 --> 25:41.540
He's like wait what fuck do you want them? Wait? Why am I here? What what what one?

25:42.060 --> 25:47.660
Maybe he loved the role of Captain Nathaniel Flint so much that he was like, this is it

25:47.660 --> 25:57.780
I'm retiring from voice acting forever and they're like, you're still gonna do either right? He's like, you know, I love that

25:57.780 --> 25:58.980
sad donkey

25:58.980 --> 26:00.980
Disney acquires Hasbro

26:01.420 --> 26:08.020
Bringing the transformers under the Disney license. Okay, and this is this this this will happen

26:09.460 --> 26:15.180
That means Kingdom Hearts for this lucky gentleman gets to play your and transformers

26:15.180 --> 26:21.920
And I think treasure planet and treasure planet guy. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. What a good day. That's a

26:22.500 --> 26:26.780
Hey, can the wizard can we talk about him real quick? Oh, no, no, please. Yes, of course, of course

26:27.300 --> 26:32.980
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to give you away. Yeah, this one's in it by the other wizard Ben can't thank you Ben

26:33.780 --> 26:39.900
So it's it's just the wiki house staff sent this one. Wow, they wrote this last year. It got

26:41.180 --> 26:42.260
63%

26:42.260 --> 26:48.420
Quality vote from the audience not great. That's a bad score. So, you know passing

26:49.140 --> 26:54.500
Yeah, but the riddles calm audience are miscreants like this isn't riddles calm

26:55.380 --> 26:57.380
Griffith's not pulling these wiki

26:59.580 --> 27:05.140
I got a wire cross. It's not a big deal. Okay. Okay. Well, um, oh, yeah, but I'm sorry guys

27:05.140 --> 27:07.720
I try to stop thinking about riddles and we're head

27:07.720 --> 27:12.920
So fucking hot it sucks. So this is how to use bad language without getting in trouble. Yes

27:13.480 --> 27:18.920
Nice part very important one staying out of trouble at home. Ask your parents what you're allowed to say

27:19.360 --> 27:21.000
That's well

27:21.000 --> 27:24.040
That's I guess it takes a lot of the fun out of it

27:24.240 --> 27:31.320
But I guess you can do that where it's like hey, how do we feel about bastard? No

27:32.120 --> 27:34.120
What if I say like this bastard?

27:34.120 --> 27:39.960
Can I say kick-ass or when referring to a donkey father?

27:40.440 --> 27:46.800
How would you prefer I refer to a donkey father? Oh, this is good because you can do the slow erosion method here

27:46.800 --> 27:53.080
Where it's just like ass is okay. Great. Okay. Well, I'm gonna say like kick-ass and then I'm gonna say is it cool?

27:53.080 --> 27:58.640
If I say shit, well, what if it's just like in the mo, right and you're gonna do basically what we have done to

27:58.640 --> 28:05.560
Like cable TV where eventually it's just like what what is the fuck ever man? Yeah, I don't have the energy to care anymore

28:05.560 --> 28:10.240
I remember the first time someone said shit on cable TV and we were all like, whoa

28:10.920 --> 28:15.080
Yeah, and now they can say things like, you know, really naughty words

28:15.080 --> 28:20.960
Well like South Park had an episode where they had a counter going in the current corner of the screen and I counted

28:20.960 --> 28:25.560
That's so fucking twisted. It was so twisted. So like a hundred times

28:25.560 --> 28:27.360
Like a half hour is so cool

28:27.360 --> 28:27.880
Okay

28:27.880 --> 28:32.560
So you might want to say something in a polite tone such as I feel like I'm getting old enough to say certain things

28:32.560 --> 28:37.840
I wasn't allowed to say before and I want to run this idea by you and see if you think there are certain words

28:37.840 --> 28:44.600
I can say now that are less offensive than hey pop pop. I'm 10 now, right? Yeah, I want to say fuck

28:45.080 --> 28:51.720
No, son. No, son. That's okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What about shit? I meet you halfway. We'll do piss

28:51.720 --> 28:59.160
We'll do piss and ass until you're 13 and then we'll see if you can show me you're responsible enough to handle piss and ass

28:59.400 --> 29:06.040
We will circle back on shit and ass. Can I call people an ass or do I can I only say that kiss my ass?

29:06.040 --> 29:13.340
Oh boy, son. Uh, I think I think referring to your own heinie as an ass is okay

29:14.520 --> 29:18.680
Okay, and it's son if I find out that you went at school and said I got to take a piss or

29:18.680 --> 29:24.960
I got to take an ass piss, which is nothing son that I got pissed out by ass. Is that anything?

29:24.960 --> 29:29.040
That's not you've lost it. Now. You've lost both. Can I say asshole you?

29:30.040 --> 29:33.840
Absolutely, you could say asshole. Okay, be conscious of who's around you

29:33.840 --> 29:34.500
If you swear at home

29:34.500 --> 29:40.040
You're giving everyone in your home the capability of hearing you make sure your parents are several rooms away before uttering a bad word

29:40.040 --> 29:48.720
Awesome, they're both in the kitchen having another argument, but you're in your bedroom. Just going ass ass ass bastard

29:49.800 --> 29:56.720
Well, maybe they're in their bedroom and they're saying dirty words quiet too because they don't think they're allowed to say them and say

29:56.720 --> 30:01.760
No, you have more in common than you don't maybe it'd be cool if all the parents are all the parents and kids just got

30:01.760 --> 30:06.400
In front of each other. This is what I'm saying. Like Justin and I have never cursed in front of each other

30:06.400 --> 30:12.160
And I think it would really bring us together Justin would curse right now. Choose your words wisely as culture change

30:12.160 --> 30:16.080
This is a quote, but it's not true. It's not gonna curse. I wanted to hear Justin what?

30:18.320 --> 30:20.320
He did he said it don't make him do it twice

30:20.800 --> 30:27.520
Fuck. All right, choose your words wisely as culture. This is a quote un-attributed as culture changes. So does what is taboo?

30:28.560 --> 30:32.480
Sure. Awesome. Somebody probably said that at some point. Somebody must have said it at some point

30:32.480 --> 30:38.440
I mean, it sounds like something someone's would say it's best if you determine a list of curse words that you find acceptable and won't

30:38.440 --> 30:44.520
Accidentally offend someone that doesn't exist. Make up your own curse words. Oh, how cool is that? Oh

30:45.120 --> 30:47.040
Piff. Oh

30:47.040 --> 30:49.040
shooty, oh

30:49.320 --> 30:51.000
Shig

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Piff my blink. Oh

30:54.200 --> 30:56.680
Oh, I belonged everywhere

30:56.680 --> 31:04.680
So anyway, do not curse. I want to say in that circumstance, I don't know what belong was standing in for. Yeah, it's a little smurfy

31:04.680 --> 31:06.880
I belonged everywhere. You shit everywhere

31:08.200 --> 31:14.120
Do not curse in front of your parents friends, even if you're not home other parents and adults may relay what you said back to your parents

31:14.760 --> 31:18.600
It should have an asterisk there. This one's actually a pretty good one

31:18.600 --> 31:27.360
because I remember I had friends and we were in their car listening to the Big Monty musical soundtrack and they were like

31:27.360 --> 31:32.400
Full Monty. Did I say Big Monty? Which I think was a pizza you could get from Monty's Pizza

31:33.400 --> 31:37.160
so anyway, they were doing the Big Monty which meant the whole balls and everything and

31:37.800 --> 31:44.960
Singing along. Now hold on, the full Monty is everything. The Big Monty is just one testicle and shaft. One nut. Yeah, so

31:44.960 --> 31:51.520
They were singing along. You're holding back one testicle. They were singing along with all the cuss words in everything and I was like, okay

31:51.520 --> 31:57.400
So we're cussing then but then there's a part that talks about smoking a joint and I sang that part out loud and they were like

31:57.400 --> 32:02.300
Whoa Griffin, that's drugs and I was like, so wait a minute. Anyway

32:03.000 --> 32:06.400
Using bad language at school one avoid cursing during class or to your teacher

32:06.400 --> 32:12.400
A lot of these are just like here's how to curse don't do it in front of anybody do it in your own secret hole

32:12.400 --> 32:15.320
Kind of cut a hole in a sheet

32:17.600 --> 32:19.600
Hole in the backyard and lay

32:20.120 --> 32:21.280
lay

32:21.280 --> 32:24.760
AstroTurf over it to make your own secret space where you can say cuss words

32:24.920 --> 32:28.520
Don't do that because if you curse that hole and then cover it up, you might grow a fuck tree

32:28.520 --> 32:30.520
You might want to do that. Oh

32:31.080 --> 32:35.740
Happen to Eddie Murphy in 1000 words. Exactly what happened to Eddie Murphy. We can't keep referencing that movie every episode

32:35.740 --> 32:42.380
Then use bad language during busy times or class changes cool

32:42.940 --> 32:48.940
Time to head to fucking math. What it's good math that you have no jurisdiction over me. Damn it. I

32:50.500 --> 32:55.220
Can't I do apologize if a teacher hears you sometimes it feels natural to let a curse word out

32:55.220 --> 32:57.180
If you drop a book your backpack rips open. Yeah

32:57.180 --> 33:00.180
Yeah, in those cases if a teacher happens to overhear you and starts glaring at you

33:00.180 --> 33:02.180
It's best to be sincere and apologize for the outburst

33:02.180 --> 33:08.300
And especially if it's your cool teacher Mike who doesn't want you to call him like mr

33:08.300 --> 33:12.380
Smith he's just like call me Mike you could probably curse in front of Mike as long as it's not the f-word and you

33:12.380 --> 33:16.740
Keep your grades up. That's how he tricks you actually Mike is actually a cuss cop and he wants to catch

33:18.620 --> 33:24.220
He's like cool, but he is not cool not Mike it is mystifying to me

33:24.220 --> 33:29.400
I want to give a quick shout out to parents who have decided that it is worth policing profanity

33:29.400 --> 33:35.240
Because like I honestly guys there's so many things that you have to fix about kids. Yeah, it's just a game of triage

33:35.240 --> 33:35.800
Oh, yeah

33:35.800 --> 33:41.040
I like we we want them to like be kind to themselves and to other people and

33:41.760 --> 33:45.480
Even that has been a multi-year fail. Oh, man, like

33:47.480 --> 33:50.040
It is a fucking sinkhole of

33:50.560 --> 33:55.900
Energy and time and money. Yeah, and it is going nowhere and it has been the one thing

33:55.900 --> 34:00.280
We've tried to do is make them decent people and you can't it's like going no

34:00.280 --> 34:02.760
Yeah, we're at less than zero and I feel like

34:03.320 --> 34:07.800
Shout out to you if you're like, I'm gonna do that. But also they can't say fuck

34:07.800 --> 34:16.320
I really I don't have the energy God bless anybody who can but I'm barely getting I would rather have my daughter

34:17.200 --> 34:23.200
BB stand in front of a room full of the judges people on earth and yell fuck with abandon if

34:23.200 --> 34:28.880
I could just stop her from awkwardly standing on top of every unstable surface

34:28.880 --> 34:33.520
She could find yes, like I would I'd be like, yeah, honey say whatever the fuck you want. Just please get down

34:33.520 --> 34:37.960
What are you doing? Please get off the calculator, honey. Why would you see him? Why do you stand on daddy's computer?

34:37.960 --> 34:42.920
Don't stand on that's even elevated that money like paper towel roll. What are you doing? Yes. Yes

34:43.400 --> 34:45.840
Yes, you can't stand on that. It's not load-bearing

34:47.400 --> 34:51.160
Practice being polite to school administrators. It doesn't say keep your grades up

34:51.160 --> 34:56.920
But I think we all know I mean that's implied there. Did you say do you curse in a polite way?

34:56.920 --> 34:59.320
You're like well, fuck you very much. I'll be moving

34:59.320 --> 34:59.480
No

34:59.480 --> 35:05.280
but I think if you're like a super polite valedictorian and you say fuck a teacher in the public school system is

35:05.680 --> 35:10.520
Thrilled right like what a long game that would be if you're like in your vector

35:11.600 --> 35:15.440
valedictorian speech and you're like anyway in closing a fuck

35:15.440 --> 35:21.840
Oh, wow, nobody can say anything you're the valedictorian apparently cursing is good and cool, right?

35:22.080 --> 35:26.800
Well, if you're 18 at that point, what are they gonna do? What are they gonna do?

35:27.280 --> 35:31.200
Call vassar and get me kicked out. No fucking way man. I'm

35:31.720 --> 35:33.760
Vassar when this goes viral. Yeah

35:33.920 --> 35:40.720
Can you remember when you guys started college and that freshman class and you just realized like I can say fuck here

35:40.720 --> 35:47.120
Like they're not gonna call my parents. It actually was a fuck. It wasn't something I was waiting on

35:50.720 --> 35:55.560
All right, let me finish this because we just got to the fun part of the article which is swearing with your friends

35:55.560 --> 35:58.480
Oh, yeah, make sure your friends are okay with cursing

35:59.840 --> 36:05.600
It was almost fun for a second or is like do you mind hey, pardon me. Do you mind if I say ass?

36:05.600 --> 36:12.440
Oh, thank you, Timothy. My best friend for life. I do have to ask you these questions ask your friends to keep it a secret

36:12.440 --> 36:16.140
And then there's somebody winking and putting a little shush finger up like shh

36:18.020 --> 36:23.100
Don't tell your parents or mine timothy cuz your parents are fucking narcs timothy

36:24.200 --> 36:26.680
Don't get too used to cursing with your friends

36:26.780 --> 36:31.680
Sometimes you get too comfortable swearing with the people you trust if this happens you could end up accidentally cursing around your family

36:31.680 --> 36:36.480
This is a quick and easy way to get yourself into trouble. That's true, man. That's so to summarize

36:37.360 --> 36:39.440
How do you use bad language without getting in trouble?

36:40.440 --> 36:45.800
Do it in a room that nobody else is in no one's gonna hear you but Jesus and

36:46.400 --> 36:51.440
He can definitely keep a secret. He can hang man. He can hang man with the best

36:51.440 --> 36:54.000
I mean this dude hung out with fishermen and these people had

36:55.120 --> 36:57.120
real dirty mouths

36:57.120 --> 37:01.160
Do you guys remember that commercial for that gum?

37:04.920 --> 37:07.640
Still think about it all the time. I think about fine commercials

37:09.520 --> 37:11.720
Yeah, do you ever see those cavemen I

37:13.440 --> 37:19.800
Actually prefer the sentient money pile from Geico. Oh, yeah. Yeah that lizard man still gets me

37:19.800 --> 37:22.880
He's cool. Like I would hang with him. You know what I mean?

37:22.880 --> 37:28.600
I kind of like sexy too like funny and get like I wasn't gonna say it, but I'm so glad you did

37:29.280 --> 37:31.280
I'm looking at oh we have ads. Oh

37:32.000 --> 37:34.680
Cool. Okay. Well, it's good one. Here's for Geico. Oh

37:35.720 --> 37:42.960
They don't insinuate you would fuck the lizard. I didn't insinuate I would fuck the host. Stop stop stop stop stop. I'm a married man

37:45.840 --> 37:47.840
Appreciate

37:47.840 --> 37:55.780
Sexual lizard I can appreciate a mascots, you know, you know his raw power without like I would never if I was

You know, we sometimes not these days, but we once when we had a television show for six episodes

38:01.060 --> 38:04.220
We didn't move in circles where we would bump elbows with celebs

38:07.100 --> 38:09.100
Right, but if I ever did like, you know

38:10.020 --> 38:12.020

38:18.400 --> 38:20.400

38:23.600 --> 38:39.160
Maybe we should go to the money zone. Okay. All right. Let's let's do this. Let's go. Let's let's go make some fun

You

43:42.260 --> 43:44.660
How about another question yes, yeah do it

43:44.660 --> 43:50.660
I'm a senior guy at a small liberal arts college in May. I never thought something like this would happen. You're probably wondering

43:52.620 --> 43:54.820
My my tan rift body

43:56.580 --> 43:58.580
All eyes on my glistening

44:00.620 --> 44:03.380
Glistening through my shirt they were my butt

44:03.380 --> 44:09.420
My butt hurt prominent cocky my perp prominent cocky, but okay

44:11.540 --> 44:13.540
Signaling all that I was ready to rut

44:15.700 --> 44:19.540
At the beginning of every semester our Outdoors Club Oh and outdoors

44:20.380 --> 44:22.220
amazing

44:22.220 --> 44:25.900
Leads incoming first years on trips into the main woods. I

44:26.740 --> 44:28.740
the main would not

44:28.740 --> 44:32.380
I marry woods, you know, what?

44:34.540 --> 44:37.620
Not those other words the normal woods I

44:38.540 --> 44:40.540
Led one of those trips last August

44:41.260 --> 44:43.380
However, after coming back and doing my laundry

44:43.380 --> 44:49.540
I realized that one of my co leaders sports bras had actually gotten mixed up with my stuff clothes

44:49.540 --> 44:56.220
Sometimes get misplaced among tent groups on trips about I let her know this had happened and she said she'd come and pick it up

44:56.220 --> 44:59.780
That was seven months ago. It has not been picked up. What do I do?

44:59.860 --> 45:05.240
Do I say nothing do a reminder to pick it up? If so, how have I passed the window?

45:05.240 --> 45:08.780
Which this could have been done painlessly. Yes, I desperately don't want to be creepy

45:08.780 --> 45:12.380
But I feel like any route I decided travel now would be perceived as such

45:13.420 --> 45:15.740
This from bra boozled in Brunswick, Maine

45:15.740 --> 45:21.500
And I do want to I do want to sympathize with you before we start trying to fix this because this is extremely challenging

45:21.860 --> 45:24.000
you did try to do the the

45:24.000 --> 45:29.780
Responsible adult thing here, but the problem that you now face is

45:30.520 --> 45:35.560
You have held on to this person's bra for seven months at that because on the one hand

45:36.000 --> 45:40.600
I know you were every day like patting it on the head as you walk out the door or something

45:40.600 --> 45:44.120
Well, I have kept this for a long time. Yes

45:44.560 --> 45:49.440
Yes, the problem is because yes, Justin you make an excellent point because I was going to say

45:49.920 --> 45:52.120
Like you you told them they left it there

45:52.120 --> 45:58.000
But but but you kept it because I don't know

45:58.520 --> 46:04.620
Throw it in the fucking garbage can. Yeah touch their boobs. No, no, no, it's not it's but you're not

46:05.500 --> 46:11.280
Immediately supposed to do that, but there was a day and I don't know how you would have divined this

46:11.440 --> 46:15.640
There was a day when you should have picked it up and taken it to the trash can

46:15.640 --> 46:20.280
I don't know what day that was though. Yeah, it wasn't seven months for certain

46:20.280 --> 46:27.520
It was a sir. We can all agree you've overshot. I would say definitely the change of seasons like

46:27.880 --> 46:29.880
like if you are I

46:30.040 --> 46:36.540
Know in Maine right you got seasons you're pulling out your winter wardrobe and the bras still there

46:37.080 --> 46:38.920
That that was the time

46:38.920 --> 46:42.680
that was that when you're going through and you're like time to put away the Bermuda shorts and

46:43.040 --> 46:48.080
Hawaiian shirts that we all have and wear a lot time to put those away and also

46:48.080 --> 46:53.640
But like Chuck this bra like that's the time I would say that's the sweet spot

46:54.120 --> 46:58.120
That's what we call that because you can't contact them again

46:58.640 --> 47:00.640
Yeah, oh, oh no

47:02.400 --> 47:07.760
Hey, I've had your bra for seven months you're gonna come get it or am I just gonna leave it on this hanger next to my

47:07.760 --> 47:09.760
Tuxedo

47:11.720 --> 47:17.360
Still here still got it. Hey, don't worry if you thought that I wouldn't cling desperately to your

47:17.360 --> 47:25.720
Discarded bra, I definitely am doing you can now throw it away with it because the chance that another human being will contact you

47:25.720 --> 47:27.640
And say hey

47:27.640 --> 47:32.600
Remember seven months ago when you said you have my bra you still have it, right?

47:32.800 --> 47:38.620
Yeah, that would be that would be wilder. I think that you're okay to after a month

47:38.620 --> 47:43.440
I think that you're okay to throw something away where you don't mind

47:43.440 --> 47:47.840
Reimbursing the dollar that that that's a get out of jail

47:47.840 --> 47:51.400
Like if somebody's like hey, I asked you about a bra like six months ago

47:51.400 --> 47:55.360
You don't still have it. The only sane answer is absolutely not like no

47:55.360 --> 48:01.520
There's no reality which but I would happily reimburse you for it because I did this I was entrusted with it

48:01.520 --> 48:05.840
Well, and I discard I disagree there Justin. I was not entrusted with it

48:05.840 --> 48:12.320
You fuck it got mixed up in my shit. You didn't hand me your bra say protect. Yeah, but if that person was like

48:12.320 --> 48:17.880
The person wasn't like drop it on the ground. Don't touch it. Meet me on a bridge

48:18.080 --> 48:20.360
I'll be on one side you be on the other side

48:21.600 --> 48:27.520
Yeah, they said I trust you with it and then every day that went past was another vote of confidence that you could handle this

48:27.920 --> 48:30.160
Responsibility and you will have failed it

48:30.800 --> 48:33.640
Because you didn't get it. Sure. Yeah, I'm worried

48:33.640 --> 48:38.880
We sound like three real porky boys though in this exact way this about any garment. Yeah

48:38.880 --> 48:41.140
Very literally about anything

48:41.760 --> 48:47.480
Right if someone left a book at my house and it was and seven and I said hey you left this year

48:47.480 --> 48:51.360
Come get it and seven months passed because here's what I'm thinking, right?

48:51.360 --> 48:51.840
Yeah

48:51.840 --> 48:57.200
I think the expiration date for lack of a better term of when you can like get rid of something is the amount of time

48:57.320 --> 49:03.080
Where you feel you could reasonably respond to the request to have it back with I have no idea where it is

49:03.400 --> 49:06.640
Right because like someone leaves your something at your house you say hey

49:06.640 --> 49:10.400
I found your book and two days later they come to pick it up and you say I don't know where it is

49:10.400 --> 49:12.780
You fucked up. Someone leaves a book at your house

49:12.780 --> 49:19.360
You call six months later after like life has happened and you're like I've cleaned up so many times since then

49:19.640 --> 49:25.560
That book could be anywhere is a fair response to it's been six months, dude

49:25.840 --> 49:30.020
Like I I think I'm getting really impassioned about this

49:30.020 --> 49:33.260
I can tell I don't know where anything in my house is at any given time

49:33.260 --> 49:38.620
Sure, let alone something that's not mine and I have no emotional or spiritual connection to

49:39.200 --> 49:42.700
Can I ask you something that like this is gonna seem weird when I initially say it

49:42.700 --> 49:44.740
Give it a second before you sweat it down. What about like?

49:45.620 --> 49:49.600
Just putting it in a bag and leaving it on their porch. Oh, that's great

49:50.100 --> 49:52.740
Now what kind of look at what kind of bag?

49:53.420 --> 49:56.020
Because the details are very important right now used

49:56.900 --> 50:01.380
No, no, not a used Kroger bag. That's a threat what you just described

50:01.380 --> 50:06.140
But I have so many of them and I care about the environment. It's like take them back to a Kroger

50:06.140 --> 50:10.180
They have a bag or can't reset. Do they have a bag recycler there? They could turn them into like, yeah

50:11.460 --> 50:14.660
Well, I keep them. I mean, I don't want I don't need to do what you're saying

50:14.660 --> 50:18.140
I keep them and use them for lots of stuff like threatening people with gloves

50:18.140 --> 50:23.420
I make makeshift gloves and boots, you know, okay. Wow for my kids

50:24.300 --> 50:27.940
They go so fast. They don't grow garbage bags. Yeah, that's fair

50:27.940 --> 50:34.340
But you just put it on and put it in a Kroger bag. No, and then you leave on a door. No

50:34.340 --> 50:39.940
Like what's wrong with that? It's a threat just it's not a threat Travis. What are they threatening it?

50:39.940 --> 50:43.660
Why would it be a threat? It feels somehow because okay

50:43.660 --> 50:49.100
I feel like sometimes we blow past Travis's bad idea so fast that he's not forced to

50:50.420 --> 50:52.420
Reinforce it. So speak on this

50:52.420 --> 50:58.100
Threat because after seven months the chance that this person is forgotten that you have their sports was very high

50:58.220 --> 51:01.780
So now and I'm assuming here you're not leaving a note incorrect

51:02.100 --> 51:06.740
Okay, but the possibility that they have forgotten is there you they have forgotten?

51:06.740 --> 51:13.220
Yes, you hang the bra in a bag. They open the door. It's there

51:14.100 --> 51:17.540
someone has left an article of clothing that

51:17.540 --> 51:25.300
They might remember is theirs on the doorknob in a bag a plastic bag and it's just a loose bra in there

51:25.620 --> 51:32.440
No, they see the brothel immediately you are assuming that now a hundred percent. I feel very okay

51:33.540 --> 51:38.680
Remember Justin and then it will be weird. You're right. You'll be weird hearing you lay it out like that. I realize

51:38.680 --> 51:45.120
Okay, bring bring Tom did you did you you know?

51:45.120 --> 51:51.740
I remember now that I thought about did you just come and without like ringing the doorbell and just handing it to me?

51:51.840 --> 51:58.660
You left it in a used Kroger bag hanging from the doorknob for me to find the next time I went to exit my do

51:58.660 --> 52:00.080
You hate me?

52:00.080 --> 52:06.400
What about this? What if you say hey, I'm moving and I'm getting packed up and I ran across this old bra of yours

52:06.400 --> 52:10.120
And they brought back so many great memories. I didn't mean to keep it. I

52:11.000 --> 52:17.120
Promise I just didn't throw it away. I found it in my roommate's room. He's a real creep. No, it's not creepy

52:17.120 --> 52:19.520
It's just like do you want the bra? Do you want it back?

52:20.160 --> 52:22.040
It's no big deal. It could be yours

52:22.040 --> 52:25.320
It could be I think that the window if they wanted it back

52:25.800 --> 52:32.120
They would have come and gone what I'm saying is you have to invent a fiction where you've encountered the bra again

52:32.120 --> 52:37.800
Yes, you don't move there. You are old friend. It's a lie. No, you're not moving up a new place

52:39.800 --> 52:45.680
Father couldn't swing it. Yeah unpacked everything opened up underneath it. You probably heard about it in the new you didn't hear about it

52:45.680 --> 52:47.680
Oh, you might hear about it tomorrow. I gotta go

52:49.240 --> 52:51.500
I actually get an early edition. So

52:54.400 --> 52:58.240
Yeah, I get I get early edition so I'm thinking of a sinkhole tomorrow

52:58.240 --> 52:59.760
I gotta go

52:59.760 --> 53:06.960
Hit me that shovel. I got like prevent it or whatever. Where's your car parked? Yeah, you should move it cuz that's sinkhole country

53:06.960 --> 53:09.420
I was gonna move across the street. Bye

53:10.340 --> 53:12.340
Do you think he's ever like?

53:12.920 --> 53:16.320
Okay, are you early edition early edition?

53:16.320 --> 53:23.240
It'll be so cool because you can do this and then you can put it like pretty high. It's Justin. Hey, Justin

53:23.680 --> 53:25.680
This is the newspaper. Okay, cool

53:25.680 --> 53:31.000
Um, can you put in a classified ad that said hey Justin it was weird with the bra

53:31.480 --> 53:36.400
Don't just forget about it and throw it in the trash. So that's who you want the classified. I have to say yeah

53:36.600 --> 53:38.600
Yeah, yeah, put it in the paper

53:38.600 --> 53:45.640
Okay, and then you would get it that more. Yeah. Oh, you've hacked the early edition conundrum, right?

53:45.640 --> 53:53.080
Yeah, you really on early edition. They never showed him like looking at the sales ads and it's like, ah tomorrow

53:53.080 --> 53:56.760
It's various. Oh, look at this with a winning lot. Oh, come on. No

53:57.680 --> 54:02.160
Fisher Stevens always wanted to use the winning lot of numbers. Oh, but then

54:03.040 --> 54:09.040
Kyle from Friday Night Lights knew that if he did that then he would lose access to the paper

54:09.720 --> 54:11.720
at most he would do like

54:12.360 --> 54:16.080
Here's a solution to yesterday's. Yeah, and he'd be like a size

54:17.080 --> 54:20.800
On my phone that the last listener stopped the show

54:20.800 --> 54:22.240
Hey

54:22.240 --> 54:27.320
Rebooting early edition. I think it's just okay. It's just us guys want to talk. Do you guys want to my social security number?

54:27.320 --> 54:31.840
I hope they reboot Cupid for a third time. No. Yep

54:32.360 --> 54:39.080
Okay. Okay, Jeremy Piven in that originally a rock block of rebooted Fantasy Island. Yeah, let's first

54:39.080 --> 54:43.400
So you're saying as long as yeah, I mean, I guess if nobody's listening we can talk about all the

54:44.200 --> 54:48.760
Bathroom you want Jeremy Piven to start in the bathroom right now a bit. I'm going I know

54:48.760 --> 54:53.600
I don't want Jeremy Piven to be in it again. He wasn't in it when they were you be rebooted at the first time

54:53.600 --> 54:56.100
Oh, what was the one Gryphon with the dude who?

54:56.680 --> 54:59.240
Was super lucky and like oh

54:59.960 --> 55:03.120

But he like what but like a kick-ass John candy. Hey, so let's wrap up the show while Justin's gone

55:24.580 --> 55:30.460

55:30.460 --> 55:31.740
