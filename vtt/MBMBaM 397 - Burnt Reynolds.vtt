00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.840
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:47.840 --> 00:52.400
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:52.400 --> 00:57.120
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. And I'm the sweet baby brother and 30 under

00:57.120 --> 01:02.320
30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy. Red, red wine.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.960
See me? It just is in my heart right now.

01:04.960 --> 01:06.000
Really? I just feel great.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.960
Yeah, just so happy to be here recording this show with you,

01:08.960 --> 01:14.480
my brothers, and that song, Gooby 40's cover of Red, Red Wine, is what is in my heart.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.560
Do you want to know what's in my- Stay close to me.

01:16.560 --> 01:24.240
Here's what's in mine, inexplicably. Now that you're gone, I just want to be with you,

01:24.240 --> 01:29.920
Enrique Iglesias. No idea why. Woke up this morning, there I was.

01:29.920 --> 01:33.680
Don't overthink it, Griffin. Open up your heart and let a song out.

01:34.640 --> 01:39.360
Probably U2's Vertigo, the introduction to it, where he's like,

01:39.360 --> 01:45.760
un, deux, trois, 14. That one gets me psyched out of my fucking mind.

01:45.760 --> 01:49.680
And don't get me wrong, I hate the rest of the song and the rest of the band's music.

01:49.680 --> 01:58.720
How great would it be if that intro was eight minutes long and him just like, Ichi, seven,

01:59.840 --> 02:02.880
green. Yeah, here's some more of my favorite words.

02:04.480 --> 02:10.080
Thano, that's my name. His name's the edge. Over there, that's Larry.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.800
I'd like to introduce you to my band. You know us.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.600
We're the Beatles. And of course, the final member, U2.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.440
U2. You are a Thano.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.720
Special thanks to U2. We couldn't have done it without you.

02:22.720 --> 02:30.240
That's why the band's called that. So do you think Larry did have a moment

02:30.240 --> 02:32.800
where he's like, you know what, you go and call yourself?

02:32.800 --> 02:34.160
Okay. Bono.

02:35.280 --> 02:40.720
And you are the edge. Okay, and I'm going to be Lightning Man.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.040
Well, actually- No, you can't be the Lightning Man.

02:43.040 --> 02:47.040
You're actually going to be Larry. And you are Adam.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.600
We're Larry and Adam. The thing, Justin, is actually

02:49.600 --> 02:55.520
Larry's legal Christian name is Inferno Lightning, and he goes by Larry.

02:55.520 --> 02:59.680
So he had to change it. Inferno, Blaze, Lightning.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.240
But he's like, the edge is like- He's like, just call me Larry.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.920
If Adam and Larry ever broke off into their own band, Adam and Larry-

03:07.920 --> 03:09.200
Us two. It would sound like-

03:09.200 --> 03:12.880
It would be called Us Two, please. They would call themselves Adam and Larry,

03:12.880 --> 03:17.280
and it would sound like two Christian comedians that go church to church

03:17.280 --> 03:20.960
doing wholesome routines. I mean, that's basically what-

03:20.960 --> 03:24.960
Basically what you two's oeuvre is. It sounded like Travis had a good intro.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.960
I'm excited to hear what- Sorry.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.680
Sorry, yeah, go ahead. We're nearing episode 400,

03:29.680 --> 03:33.680
and so I wanted to inject a new segment to kind of bring new life.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.720
And I was thinking about this last night as I was trying to fall asleep.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.720
Just, I was really worried about Daylight Savings Time.

03:38.720 --> 03:41.680
You know, it's keeping me up. For the time thief.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.200
For the farmers to come and take away the hour they gave us back in fall.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.480
So I've titled this segment, What Do You Think You Would Do If?

03:49.680 --> 03:53.840
I've come up with some hypothetical scenarios I got for here,

03:53.840 --> 03:55.120
that I don't want to pitch to you guys.

03:55.120 --> 04:01.120
So this is like an audio sort of theater of the mind John Quinone experiment.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.360
Yeah, sort of like that. So Justin Griffin,

04:03.360 --> 04:05.680
what do you think you would do if you saw a bear,

04:06.640 --> 04:10.480
and then the bear kind of like padded the seat next to him,

04:10.480 --> 04:12.800
and he just kind of like stared up at the stars?

04:14.400 --> 04:17.040
Is it sexual? The padding?

04:17.040 --> 04:20.320
No, it's more just kind of, well, it's an open-ended invitation.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.560
I don't want to limit where the scenario will go,

04:22.560 --> 04:25.680
because that's kind of up to you, but it's just, it's just an invitation.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.480
I mean, I can't, I'm in a place in my life right now

04:30.480 --> 04:33.040
where I can't just go around kissing bears in the forest.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.560
Weird strange bears in the forest.

04:34.560 --> 04:39.440
I'm married, you know, I got a kid, I got responsibilities, I got fidelities.

04:40.880 --> 04:46.000
And I'm worried about what this sort of atmosphere would create.

04:47.040 --> 04:51.040
The bear's breath hot on my face, rich with honey.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.720
So I would say, but boy, I do love stargazing.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.560
I think I would have to create a sort of platonic atmosphere with the bear

04:58.560 --> 05:02.720
in a way that doesn't make the bear feel threatened, like it needs to attack me.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.720
Excellent. Justin?

05:04.720 --> 05:05.920
I want my own.

05:05.920 --> 05:06.160
Okay.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.280
Griffin already did that.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.400
So Justin, what would you do, what do you think you would do

05:10.400 --> 05:15.280
if Burt Reynolds came to you and said that he needed your help

05:15.840 --> 05:20.320
because he had loaned a friend his DVD copy of Meet the Parents,

05:20.320 --> 05:22.480
and then the friend said that he didn't have it,

05:22.480 --> 05:27.120
but Burt Reynolds had seen it on his friend's entertainment center the week before?

05:27.120 --> 05:30.960
Did you say Burt Reynolds, which is my favorite crayon color?

05:30.960 --> 05:33.600
Yes. Okay.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.760
That's actually Burt Reynolds' full name is Burnt Reynolds, and he shortened it.

05:38.960 --> 05:39.920
It is silent.

05:40.720 --> 05:43.840
So Travis, you didn't finish your anecdote.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.160
So Burt Reynolds-

05:46.160 --> 05:50.800
Burt Reynolds, he loaned his friend his DVD copy of Meet the Parents.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.680
Now he does also have a Blu-ray copy, so it's not pressing,

05:53.680 --> 05:56.960
but he loaned his DVD copy of Meet the Parents to his friend.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.000
And then when he asked for it back,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.360
a friend said he didn't have it, but Burt Reynolds had seen it

06:01.360 --> 06:04.080
on his friend's entertainment center the week before.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.560
The DVD's got better special features too.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.320
It has the gag reel Easter egg.

06:10.720 --> 06:14.480
Okay, so is the person who he loaned the DVD to,

06:14.480 --> 06:16.000
is he part of the Hollywood Glitterati?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.200
Do I know the friend?

06:17.200 --> 06:18.400
No, it's just his friend Doug.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.240
Doug Reynolds? No.

06:22.880 --> 06:23.840
That wouldn't make any sense.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.480
There would be no reason for what I said.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.400
No, it's actually Dung Reynolds.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.480
And it's silent.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.160
Okay, so Burt asked me to get...

06:36.160 --> 06:38.560
Okay, do I have any sort of relationship with Dung?

06:40.720 --> 06:43.360
Let's say you maybe live on the same block,

06:43.360 --> 06:45.040
but you haven't spent a lot of time together,

06:45.040 --> 06:47.280
but you've seen each other at the local swap meets.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.320
Okay, so what I would do is this friendship with...

06:52.320 --> 06:54.640
I'm not the sort of person who when they make

06:54.640 --> 06:58.560
a celebrity friend, sort of milks it for all it's worth.

06:58.560 --> 07:02.400
So I am really gonna try to foster a better friendship

07:02.400 --> 07:05.440
between me and Burt, and what I'm gonna do is

07:05.440 --> 07:11.440
I'm gonna buy him a new copy of Meet the Parents on DVD,

07:11.440 --> 07:13.760
and I'm gonna give it to him, and wait,

07:13.760 --> 07:15.040
there's right answers?

07:15.040 --> 07:16.080
Well, don't worry about that.

07:16.080 --> 07:16.960
Hold on, don't worry about that.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.560
No, hold on, I need to know if there's right answers

07:18.560 --> 07:20.560
to this segment, because then I might do my bear one.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.400
No, you're both right so far.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.680
You're nailing it, 100%.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.320
So it was sexual, we can all agree this bear

07:26.320 --> 07:28.080
is trying to put the moves on me.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.640
Okay, so yeah, I would get him a new DVD,

07:30.640 --> 07:32.880
and I would say, like, here, I don't want you

07:32.880 --> 07:34.480
to have to worry about this anymore.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.040
You're in your Twilight years, you just did that

07:38.400 --> 07:41.200
direct to direct TV.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.160
That is a thing, actually, it is direct to direct TV.

07:46.160 --> 07:49.120
Burt Reynolds movie, the...

07:49.120 --> 07:52.800
So, you know, I want him to keep acting,

07:52.800 --> 07:55.760
I want him to focus his energies on that,

07:56.720 --> 07:58.320
and I don't necessarily want him

07:59.200 --> 08:00.400
worrying about this DVD anymore.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.920
So I'm gonna drive a wedge between him and Dung

08:04.560 --> 08:07.120
by buying him a copy of the DVD, and he'll say,

08:07.120 --> 08:08.720
thank goodness I don't have to worry about that anymore.

08:08.720 --> 08:09.520
Thank you, Justin.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.600
Give me a second to finish writing that down.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.800
Thank you, Justin.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.080
Wait, why do you need to write it down?

08:14.080 --> 08:15.120
Don't worry about it.

08:15.120 --> 08:19.280
Okay, so Griffin, here's your second one.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.560
What do you think you would do if you were a turtle

08:23.440 --> 08:25.360
and you had really good credit,

08:25.360 --> 08:27.440
but you're not sure if you're ready to settle down

08:27.440 --> 08:29.360
with your long-term girlfriend, Sheila?

08:31.200 --> 08:33.280
Why does my credit have anything?

08:33.280 --> 08:33.920
It's really good.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.760
This is just sort of character development

08:37.760 --> 08:39.920
about turtle not being.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.360
So what do you think you would do?

08:41.360 --> 08:43.040
I mean, here's the thing.

08:43.040 --> 08:46.240
Turtles live for fucking 2,000 years.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.880
We all got the same turtles from back in Christ's time,

08:50.880 --> 08:54.640
basically, and so if you settle down as a turtle,

08:54.640 --> 08:55.760
that really means something,

08:55.760 --> 08:57.840
because you're talking about thousands of years,

08:57.840 --> 09:03.840
but potentially, and then it's all about spawning

09:04.400 --> 09:06.720
and the eggs, there's like a billion of them,

09:06.720 --> 09:08.240
and that's a big responsibility, too.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.600
I kind of get it, but at the same time,

09:13.120 --> 09:14.160
it's pretty long.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.840
I don't have a good answer for this one, Travis.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.600
You've given me literally nothing.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.880
That is correct.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.000
Justin, here's the final one.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.920
What do you think you would do if-

09:23.920 --> 09:25.280
Oh, wow, wow.

09:25.280 --> 09:29.040
You saw fire, and at first you panicked a little bit,

09:29.040 --> 09:31.840
but then you realized it was just like a campfire

09:31.840 --> 09:34.560
and all of your closest friends were sitting around it,

09:35.040 --> 09:37.040
and they were all really worried about you.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.880
And they were all really silent,

09:38.880 --> 09:40.160
and at first you're like, what's going on?

09:40.160 --> 09:42.560
But then you realize they're all just being contemplative

09:42.560 --> 09:44.000
and thinking about life,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.400
and then the fire starts to die down,

09:48.000 --> 09:51.120
and you go through all the proper steps to put the fire out

09:51.120 --> 09:54.160
and pour sand on it and stuff and make sure it's out.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.000
And then you go and you lay down in your tent

09:56.000 --> 09:57.600
and you start to feel a little hungry,

09:57.600 --> 09:59.680
and you remember you have a cliff bar in your jacket,

09:59.680 --> 10:03.440
but then you think, oh, no, I left my jacket out by the fire.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.680
But then you realize that, no, you brought it in.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.280
It's in the tent with you.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.600
And you go into the pocket and you get the cliff bar out

10:09.600 --> 10:10.960
and you had thought it was chocolate chip,

10:10.960 --> 10:12.960
but it's actually oatmeal chocolate chip.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.280
Then you eat it and you don't feel hungry anymore,

10:15.280 --> 10:16.240
and then you go to sleep.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.720
Kind of feels like Travis only had two.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.640
Yeah, I don't think that one, it requires much action.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.240
So what do you think you would do if?

10:26.080 --> 10:28.160
What I would probably do is continue to sleep,

10:29.040 --> 10:30.320
have a restless night's sleep

10:30.320 --> 10:33.040
because laying on the earthen ground is always difficult.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.080
And you ate so late,

10:34.080 --> 10:36.240
and you know that always gives you weird dreams.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.480
Yeah, and I would have a weird dream

10:38.480 --> 10:40.160
and I would wake up the next day

10:40.800 --> 10:44.640
and build a new fire and start the cycle again.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.160
Excellent, you are correct.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.400
You are trapped in a time cycle.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.760
You nailed that one.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.560
Waiting for Dr. Who to come, that is his name,

10:52.560 --> 10:57.040
Dr. Who to come rescue me or her name, excuse me,

10:58.400 --> 11:01.760
wait for her to come rescue me from the cycle.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.320
All right, now Travis, it's your turn.

11:04.320 --> 11:05.360
What do you think you would do?

11:05.360 --> 11:07.920
No, Justin, you have to really squawk it.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.080
What do you think you would do

11:10.640 --> 11:14.880
if you were friends with Barack Obama?

11:18.880 --> 11:20.080
Friends to acquaintances.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.680
You don't know each other great, but whatever.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.280
So I might invite him to hang out in a big group hang,

11:25.280 --> 11:28.240
but it would be weird if he and I went on a road trip?

11:28.240 --> 11:29.200
Yes, thank you.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.080
All right, you're borrowing this dude's DVDs nonstop.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.080
And you had some live shows coming up

11:34.080 --> 11:36.080
and you needed a poster design

11:36.080 --> 11:38.400
and you asked Barack to make one for you.

11:38.400 --> 11:42.800
Even if it's not good, it's still the poster that Barack made

11:42.800 --> 11:45.120
and people are gonna be wild for it.

11:45.120 --> 11:48.320
He gives you a link, a shareable link

11:48.880 --> 11:50.720
for some of his rough sketches,

11:50.720 --> 11:52.960
sort of what he's thinking about for the shows.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.720
When you click through the link, the posters are there,

11:57.360 --> 11:58.560
they're terrible.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.960
I mean, they are wretched.

12:02.240 --> 12:09.200
But you also see a directory in the Dropbox that says Pirate.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.520
And when you go into it,

12:12.080 --> 12:17.600
you find off-screen filmed copies of The Post,

12:20.000 --> 12:24.400
of Thor Ragnarok, of Lady Bird,

12:25.040 --> 12:27.600
and then some like Broadway stuff.

12:27.600 --> 12:28.880
Oh, geez.

12:28.880 --> 12:32.000
Legally Blonde, he filmed a preview of Legally Blonde

12:32.000 --> 12:33.120
and tormented it.

12:33.120 --> 12:33.520
Oh, man.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.440
He didn't film it, he tormented it.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.440
So what do you think you would do?

12:38.720 --> 12:42.720
So if I found out that our former president,

12:42.720 --> 12:48.080
Barack Hussein Obama, had pirated not only film,

12:48.080 --> 12:52.640
but also Broadway, which is probably,

12:52.640 --> 12:55.760
I would say even more upsetting than pirating film.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.400
And the Olympics, and some football games.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.000
And you're not supposed to do that.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.600
Yeah, it's some of his favorite football games.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.320
What would I do?

13:03.120 --> 13:03.600
You know what?

13:03.600 --> 13:04.320
I'd turn him in.

13:05.200 --> 13:05.600
Wow.

13:06.320 --> 13:11.040
I mean, listen, I'm not proud, but I'm lawful good.

13:11.040 --> 13:11.840
You know what I mean?

13:11.840 --> 13:13.920
If there's one thing people know about me.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.760
Would you really fucking turn him in?

13:15.760 --> 13:16.000
No.

13:16.640 --> 13:17.280
No, of course I wouldn't, Justin.

13:17.280 --> 13:18.560
Okay, well, why don't you answer my question?

13:18.560 --> 13:20.160
Why don't you quit being full of shit

13:20.160 --> 13:20.400
for a fucking minute of your life?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.320
Yeah, I want to answer my fucking query.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.840
Because I panicked.

13:23.840 --> 13:24.960
Do you want to know the truth, Justin?

13:24.960 --> 13:26.080
That's a hard game, huh?

13:26.080 --> 13:27.920
In this administration, you want to hand

13:27.920 --> 13:29.840
the former president, Barack Hussein Obama,

13:29.840 --> 13:31.440
over to this current administration

13:31.440 --> 13:33.360
as a federal criminal.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.480
You want to do that.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.400
That's your fucking choice.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.680
Here's what I would do, Justin.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.360
Here's what I would do.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.080
Do you want to know what I would fucking do?

13:42.080 --> 13:43.120
Yeah, I wouldn't have asked it

13:43.120 --> 13:43.760
if I didn't want to know what you would do.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.440
Here's what I fucking do, Justin.

13:46.480 --> 13:50.400
I would maybe set up some sort of elaborate prank,

13:50.960 --> 13:52.240
but not like a funny prank,

13:52.240 --> 13:54.720
but like kind of a scared straight kind of prank,

13:54.720 --> 13:57.040
where I was like, and if that had been real,

13:57.600 --> 14:01.120
you'd be in prison right now, Barry, you know?

14:01.120 --> 14:02.080
I'm worried about you.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.160
Okay, you show up at his door,

14:05.040 --> 14:07.120
dressed up as a movie cop.

14:09.360 --> 14:14.480
My name is Ace Shooter, Hollywood Cop,

14:14.480 --> 14:16.480
and I probably don't want to show up

14:16.480 --> 14:18.800
at former president Barack Obama's house

14:19.360 --> 14:21.520
and say your name is Ace Shooter.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.760
That's a fucking, that's my fucking name.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.800
What do you want me to do?

14:25.440 --> 14:26.400
Have it changed.

14:27.520 --> 14:31.680
Go to the Imagitorium and get a new name for Ace Shooter.

14:32.240 --> 14:38.720
Fine, my name is Ace Cool Flicks,

14:39.360 --> 14:42.160
and my name is Ace Netflix, and I'm here.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.960
Would you steal a car, former president Barack Hussein Obama?

14:46.960 --> 14:48.160
I do not think so.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.000
So why have you stolen the ladybird?

14:51.280 --> 14:53.440
You're going to jail for a very long time.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.560
Just kidding, it's me, Griffin.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.800
But you learned something.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.120
I feel like he didn't give him time to get scared.

15:04.560 --> 15:07.040
He knew it was you, you're close friends.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.320
Let me try again.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.320
He's closer to Griffin than he is to Travis.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.040
Hey, what's up?

15:13.040 --> 15:16.080
My name is Damien Blockbuster, Hollywood police,

15:16.080 --> 15:18.400
and I'm here to talk to you about the ladybirds you stole.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.240
Did you use this to get past the Secret Service?

15:22.240 --> 15:24.720
Because I think that they would probably answer the door

15:24.720 --> 15:26.240
and not let you get close unless you-

15:26.240 --> 15:28.320
No, Justin, it's a jurisdiction thing,

15:28.320 --> 15:30.720
because at that point, the Hollywood police

15:30.720 --> 15:32.720
trumps the Secret Service.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.480
I brought a pie, and I'm like, this is Barack home, president?

15:38.480 --> 15:41.360
And then I laid on him.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.080
I'm going to put you in the Slammer now,

15:44.080 --> 15:47.360
the Hollywood Slammer, and wait for it.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.120
Just kidding, it's me, Griffin.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.320
I tear off the beard.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.480
Oh, there's the beard.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.080
There is no Damien Blockbuster.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.080
I mean, maybe somewhere.

15:57.280 --> 15:58.560
This is a good segment, Travis.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.200
Hey, thank you.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.360
Speaking of the live shows that we got,

16:03.360 --> 16:04.960
former president Barack Hussein Obama

16:04.960 --> 16:06.000
to make posters for us,

16:06.000 --> 16:07.200
should we talk about the live shows

16:07.200 --> 16:08.640
we do actually have coming up?

16:08.640 --> 16:09.920
Yeah, let's blaze through them.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.840
Folks, we're hitting the road this year.

16:11.840 --> 16:12.960
We're getting back out there.

16:13.840 --> 16:14.960
It's too much road.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.400
I'm looking at a list of road, and I'm already exhausted.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.360
There's a lot of roads.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.440
I'm not going to bog you down with a bunch of dates

16:21.440 --> 16:25.040
because you can find those at mcroyshows.com forward slash tours.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.480
Trevor, can you go ahead and put those on there

16:28.480 --> 16:30.400
even if we don't have the links yet?

16:30.400 --> 16:32.720
Yeah, by the time this goes live, they'll be up there.

16:32.720 --> 16:33.280
They'll be up there.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.600
Okay, mcroyshows.com forward slash tours.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.320
We are coming to...

16:37.280 --> 16:38.560
Okay, my brother, my brother and me

16:38.560 --> 16:42.000
is coming to Dallas, Houston, St. Louis,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.080
Detroit, Columbus, San Francisco,

16:45.120 --> 16:47.680
Phoenix, Orlando, and Atlanta.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.160
Now, some of those two are also Adventure Zone shows.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.120
Adventure Zone is going to be in-

16:51.120 --> 16:52.960
I was going to do them separately.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.760
The Adventure Zone is coming to Dallas,

16:57.200 --> 16:59.280
San Francisco, and Atlanta.

17:00.160 --> 17:03.120
Yes, and those are over like the next,

17:03.120 --> 17:04.320
Jesus, like six months.

17:04.320 --> 17:07.200
Yeah, from April to September in there.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.880
There's a lot of shows going up, folks.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.920
It's going to be a lot of fun,

17:11.920 --> 17:13.840
and we're very much looking forward to it.

17:13.840 --> 17:15.120
I know I said that I wasn't

17:15.120 --> 17:18.240
because of how exhausted I was,

17:18.240 --> 17:20.800
but it's going to be a hoot.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.000
Some of these have never been to.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.720
Columbus, Detroit, St. Louis.

17:24.720 --> 17:25.680
What's up, St. Louis?

17:25.680 --> 17:27.120
Going to get up in that big scary arch.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.080
Phoenix.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.120
Phoenix has its own arch.

17:29.120 --> 17:32.000
I have been to Columbus many times.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.440
That's where COSI is.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.480
Nice try.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.000
But we haven't done no shows there.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.160
Anyway, yeah, all the links and stuff

17:38.160 --> 17:39.920
are at mcroyshows.com slash tours.

17:39.920 --> 17:43.360
Now, tickets are going to go on sale this week,

17:43.360 --> 17:44.960
so look lively.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.360
Somebody with the email open

17:47.360 --> 17:49.280
can probably tell you exactly when that's going to be.

17:50.400 --> 17:54.240
Yeah, so tickets are going to go on sale Friday the 16th

17:54.800 --> 17:56.880
at 10 a.m. local time.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.160
Now, just-

17:58.160 --> 17:59.840
Local to where the shows are,

17:59.840 --> 18:01.440
not just where you live.

18:01.440 --> 18:01.920
Correct.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.000
Now, the thing, keep in mind,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.120
just as a word of warning

18:05.120 --> 18:06.240
because it's happened before,

18:06.240 --> 18:08.080
it's always possible that they go on sale

18:08.080 --> 18:08.960
a little bit early,

18:09.520 --> 18:12.320
so maybe don't jump on right at like 10 a.m.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.560
Maybe start checking a few minutes before

18:14.560 --> 18:16.800
just something to keep in mind.

18:16.800 --> 18:20.240
Now, we are going to be doing a pre-sale also.

18:20.240 --> 18:20.720
Correct.

18:21.920 --> 18:26.880
That's going to be Wednesday, March 14th at 10 a.m. local

18:26.880 --> 18:31.280
to Thursday, March 15th at 10 p.m. local.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.960
There's going to be a pre-sale going,

18:32.960 --> 18:35.600
and all you need to do to access that pre-sale

18:35.600 --> 18:37.680
is use the password mybrother,

18:37.680 --> 18:40.480
and that's the same for Taz and the Bim Bam shows.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.920
It's mybrother,

18:41.920 --> 18:44.720
and you can use that pre-sale to get into,

18:44.720 --> 18:45.760
to buy the tickets early.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.360
If you want to go to the shows, do that.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.400
Do the pre-sale because if you wait for the other one,

18:50.400 --> 18:51.520
it might be tough.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.160
If you have problems accessing the site,

18:54.160 --> 18:56.560
if the site goes down, which it tends to,

18:57.760 --> 18:58.880
keep trying.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.320
Don't like get out of queue or whatever,

19:00.320 --> 19:01.280
and if you're going to tweet at somebody,

19:01.280 --> 19:04.560
tweet at the venue or whatever if you're having issues

19:04.560 --> 19:06.880
because we are not going to be able to do anything about it.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.600
We're going aggro, Craig, with this fucking schedule,

19:09.600 --> 19:11.920
so we are not going to be able to add more shows and stuff

19:11.920 --> 19:15.040
like we usually do, so look lively.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.880
May the odds be ever in your favor.

19:16.880 --> 19:17.840
Please don't tweet at us.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.240
We have no idea how this fucking process works.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.560
And just, we also are going to,

19:23.200 --> 19:25.200
that's only up till the beginning of September.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.080
We're looking at some other things, nothing guaranteed,

19:28.080 --> 19:30.240
but we're going to try to keep doing them

19:30.240 --> 19:31.040
throughout the year too,

19:31.040 --> 19:32.960
but this is the only thing that's confirmed

19:32.960 --> 19:34.320
and guaranteed right now.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.560
All right, so look lively.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.640
Justin, read this question.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.280
Here we go with the show.

19:42.800 --> 19:46.480
I like watching nature shows at night before bed to relax.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.560
My cat has begun doing this cute thing

19:48.560 --> 19:50.160
where he sits at the foot of the bed

19:50.160 --> 19:52.080
and inadvertently watches the TV with me.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.920
Or intently, not intently.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.680
You really added a lot of letters.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.120
Whoa, I added a lot of there.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.680
Okay, intently watches the TV with me.

19:59.680 --> 20:03.120
His favorite shows feature birds or four-legged critters,

20:03.120 --> 20:04.720
like David Attenborough shows, of course.

20:04.720 --> 20:09.680
Like David Attenborough, a centaur.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.480
One night, I was watching some trashy TV

20:12.480 --> 20:16.400
when my cat hopped up on the bed and began watching.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.560
Immediately, I changed from my trashy TV show

20:18.560 --> 20:21.520
to a nature show I knew he would like so that he would stay.

20:22.160 --> 20:25.120
And then I realized I just tailored my TV time

20:25.120 --> 20:26.400
to my cat's preferences.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.360
Brothers, what's the protocol

20:29.360 --> 20:31.200
for sharing TV time with a cat?

20:31.200 --> 20:34.400
How can I expand my cat's interest beyond just critter shows?

20:34.400 --> 20:37.440
And that's from Not That Crazy Cat Lady in Tennessee.

20:38.800 --> 20:43.280
Maybe your cat just wants you to learn something

20:43.280 --> 20:50.800
about alligators instead of just watching some Garbo TV.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.520
Maybe your cat wants to enrich your mind

20:53.520 --> 20:55.760
with David Attenborough's lessons.

20:55.760 --> 20:59.200
And I still, people are always talking about this dude

20:59.200 --> 21:02.560
and I still just have no idea who it is.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.640
But I assume he gets up there and he's like,

21:04.640 --> 21:06.480
alligators, is he British?

21:07.440 --> 21:12.080
Alligators, the snakes with legs.

21:12.080 --> 21:17.600
And you learn about them instead of seeing a bunch of people

21:17.600 --> 21:20.560
hit each other in the street while drunk.

21:20.560 --> 21:21.760
I don't know, I don't know.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.040
I feel like that's a good thing.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.040
How far does this go though?

21:25.040 --> 21:27.760
If you start indulging your cat this way

21:27.760 --> 21:30.400
and then you turn on the new Brian Eno record

21:30.400 --> 21:32.240
and your cat comes over and he swats your face,

21:32.240 --> 21:33.440
you say, I want Skinnerd.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.040
Put on Skinnerd.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.560
Put on some Skinnerd.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.400
Put on some Skinnerd.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.480
Now, I learned to talk.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.280
Also, get the wet food.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.200
I know it's a pain in the ass,

21:45.200 --> 21:47.040
but I want the wet stuff.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.280
You gotta open one can at a time.

21:49.280 --> 21:52.560
I like them commercials with the dog in the china dish.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.320
Oh, I like that.

21:54.320 --> 21:59.360
I'm tired of that dry stuff that's supposed to make my shit smell good.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.960
It's never gonna happen.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.840
Give me the can. Give me better shit sand, Debbie.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.040
I've been thinking about it.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.000
I think I want it.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.280
Eat a bacon strip.

22:08.480 --> 22:09.760
Fuck you.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.040
Send me to school.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.120
I want to go to school.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.960
Stop keeping me from school.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.320
I want to learn.

22:18.320 --> 22:19.520
I want to be like you.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.920
Give me a mantra and fire.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.320
I'm going to go to technical college

22:24.320 --> 22:26.080
and learn how to maintain servers.

22:28.560 --> 22:28.960
I want to go to living.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.800
Ever since you closed down the plant,

22:30.800 --> 22:31.760
I've been stagnant.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.080
Yeah, I don't know what happened.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.760
I want a future.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.760
I can't access my email anymore.

22:37.760 --> 22:38.640
Is there any way you can-

22:38.640 --> 22:40.080
Yeah, I can fix it.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.120
And we just plug-

22:41.120 --> 22:43.920
Oh, you didn't have it plugged into the damn Wi-Fi.

22:43.920 --> 22:44.800
Hold on.

22:44.800 --> 22:45.840
All right, I did it.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.920
I'm gonna knock your mouse off your desk now.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.560
Scanner, fuck you.

22:51.520 --> 22:52.240
Don't you want to use-

22:52.240 --> 22:54.000
Wouldn't that be easier if you use the mouse?

22:54.000 --> 22:54.960
No, I don't.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.400
I don't enjoy using the-

22:56.400 --> 22:57.600
It's my predilections.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.280
I don't like using mice.

22:59.280 --> 23:02.480
And it's also better sensitivity with the trackpad, really.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.560
Yeah, look at these pads.

23:05.440 --> 23:06.320
Look at them.

23:07.120 --> 23:07.440
All right.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.200
Hey, you got any milk?

23:11.200 --> 23:15.120
So we just did a fun cat character

23:15.120 --> 23:17.600
rather than just sort of addressing the issue.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.720
I think that helped though.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.080
I mean, it doesn't.

23:20.080 --> 23:25.760
I mean, if your cat can like nature shows,

23:25.760 --> 23:29.360
then your cat can learn to like My 600-lb Life.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.320
So you just gotta help.

23:32.320 --> 23:33.600
You meet your cat halfway,

23:33.600 --> 23:35.200
watch a little something they like,

23:35.200 --> 23:36.640
and then watch a little something you like.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.640
And sometimes you can get them on board

23:38.640 --> 23:41.680
with the storylines of something,

23:42.640 --> 23:45.920
especially those episodic, trashy reality TV shows.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.960
Maybe try to adjust your cat's taste

23:48.960 --> 23:50.480
so they like the stuff you like.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.600
Yeah, do you know cats?

23:55.600 --> 23:56.880
That ain't gonna happen.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.080
My cat is just,

23:58.080 --> 23:59.920
I can't get this little guy to do anything.

23:59.920 --> 24:01.760
Maybe get your cat a smaller TV

24:01.760 --> 24:03.360
that you just play nature shows on

24:03.360 --> 24:04.560
so you can watch what you want.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.560
Well, but that's gonna end up with you

24:06.560 --> 24:09.200
watching a small TV and him watching a big TV.

24:12.160 --> 24:15.200
He just, my cat runs my life, you know?

24:18.160 --> 24:20.720
I'm just operating on his schedule at this point.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.280
You know what I mean?

24:22.240 --> 24:24.160
If they were to make a sitcom about me and my cat,

24:24.160 --> 24:25.760
you know what we'd call it, Who's the Boss?

24:26.720 --> 24:29.120
Except maybe they'd stylize it as Who's the Paws?

24:31.680 --> 24:32.400
Who's the Paws?

24:34.560 --> 24:35.920
Maybe Muse the Boss?

24:39.920 --> 24:41.920
So Griffin, you got a Yahoo?

24:41.920 --> 24:42.400
I do.

24:43.520 --> 24:46.880
Here's one that was sent in by Merit Palmer.

24:46.880 --> 24:47.440
Thank you, Merit.

24:47.440 --> 24:48.560
It's Yahoo Answers user,

24:48.560 --> 24:56.720
BolsteadNorge asks,

24:58.320 --> 25:01.120
if a word in the dictionary were misspelled,

25:01.680 --> 25:02.560
how would we know?

25:03.840 --> 25:04.960
Oh, shit.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.400
Whoa, fuck.

25:07.360 --> 25:10.320
No additional details listed or required.

25:12.880 --> 25:13.840
How would we know?

25:13.840 --> 25:18.400
No, like a real toughy like archipelago.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.760
And you're like, did I do this right?

25:19.760 --> 25:20.880
Let's check with the dictionary.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.440
And the dictionary is like, here's how we think it is.

25:23.440 --> 25:26.240
But how did they come, how did they figure that out?

25:26.240 --> 25:28.480
And words that you can't really figure out,

25:28.480 --> 25:31.280
like what the right way is, like color or color.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.600
Like whatever they list is just how it goes.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.600
But did they go to the, you know,

25:37.600 --> 25:40.240
where did they find the ancient stone tablet

25:40.240 --> 25:42.080
that was just like, nah, nah, nah.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.320
Here's how you spell archipelago.

25:44.320 --> 25:48.320
Okay, words do change their spelling over time, right?

25:48.320 --> 25:52.080
So if you look at like early, like old English,

25:52.080 --> 25:54.240
you're gonna see a lot of wild vowels

25:54.240 --> 25:55.840
and what have you in there, right?

25:55.840 --> 25:57.920
Yeah, and like what's up used to be what's up.

25:57.920 --> 25:59.760
And then all the great commercials came out

25:59.760 --> 26:01.920
and now the dictionary says it's was up.

26:01.920 --> 26:04.720
Yeah, so that language changes.

26:04.720 --> 26:09.440
I think if the dictionary changes the spelling on something,

26:09.440 --> 26:12.400
that's the spelling.

26:12.400 --> 26:16.080
Yeah, I actually, I think that there are also

26:16.080 --> 26:19.040
quantum words like restaurant, for example.

26:19.040 --> 26:22.720
I think if you look at it, it changes between

26:22.720 --> 26:28.720
being R-E-S-T-A-U-R-A-N-T or A-R-A-U-N-T,

26:28.720 --> 26:30.320
depending on when you're looking at it

26:30.320 --> 26:32.080
and who's looking at it, because I don't believe

26:32.080 --> 26:34.320
that there is actually a right way to spell restaurant

26:34.320 --> 26:37.760
and I'll always get it wrong forever and ever and ever.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.240
You know what I always get made as convenience?

26:40.240 --> 26:42.000
Oh, yeah.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.720
A resuscitation, like anything with like the double S's

26:44.720 --> 26:46.400
in there somewhere. How often are you putting that down?

26:46.400 --> 26:48.000
What? How often are you doing resuscitation?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Yeah, how often do you have to say resuscitation?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.360
I can't even say a fucking thing.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.880
Sure, I can't even say it.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.520
Are you using resuscitation a lot?

26:55.520 --> 26:57.440
Oh, you know the other one, occasionally.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.120
Oh, yeah. Which ones are doubles?

27:00.480 --> 27:02.720
Balloon. Balloon gets you?

27:02.720 --> 27:04.800
Balloon is tough. Is it a double L?

27:04.800 --> 27:06.240
I don't know, I don't remember. Oh, shit.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.400
Or a single O? This is my ballon.

27:11.520 --> 27:13.600
But that's what I'm saying. They could just change it.

27:13.600 --> 27:14.720
And they're always adding stuff.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.480
They're very hip and very woke

27:16.480 --> 27:20.240
and they're always adding stuff to the word Bible.

27:20.800 --> 27:24.160
And just kind of, who's making these calls?

27:24.160 --> 27:27.440
It's just like, now balloon is one L, one O.

27:27.440 --> 27:31.200
It's ballon. And now that's how it is.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.600
And if every other, and when they do that,

27:33.600 --> 27:38.240
every book ever written before that is just full of typos.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.120
Yeah, it's just wrong.

27:39.120 --> 27:42.480
How come there's not a fucking competing dictionary?

27:42.480 --> 27:42.800
Yes.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.240
There's only the one dictionary company that's out there

27:46.240 --> 27:48.320
and they're the only ones deciding.

27:48.320 --> 27:51.200
And I think it's time for us to maybe do a dictionary.

27:51.920 --> 27:55.440
And it can probably just not be all the words.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.880
I don't think we're gonna be competing with them on scale.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.360
But like some of this stuff, there's just like the word-

28:01.360 --> 28:02.640
Just the hard words.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.000
Like conscience.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.720
It's just like, I would just miss that one.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.960
And I would just be like, conscience.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.400
The thing inside of you tells you whether it's good or not.

28:12.400 --> 28:13.680
How it's spelled.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.360
Just whatever.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.560
Just go for it.

28:16.560 --> 28:19.280
That's the thing is we're fine listing multiple definitions

28:19.280 --> 28:21.120
for words, but not multiple spellings.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.480
Come on, grow up.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.320
Grow the fuck up, Miriam.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.360
It's 2018.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.880
Things are spelled however.

28:26.880 --> 28:29.360
I've got too much on my plate to worry about

28:29.360 --> 28:31.200
where the U goes in restaurant.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.560
And with our, the McElroy's super good dictionary,

28:34.560 --> 28:36.800
spelling bees become way more fun.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.720
Cause then it'd be like, if they get up there

28:38.720 --> 28:40.400
and spell it, it'd be like, spell archipelago.

28:40.400 --> 28:44.960
And they'd be like, A-R-K-A-P-E-L-I-G-O.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.480
And they'd be like, I guess.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.040
That tracks.

28:47.040 --> 28:47.540
Fine.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.760
It was so fun pretending there's only one-

28:49.760 --> 28:51.840
And then they would go do a physical challenge.

28:51.840 --> 28:52.160
Yes.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.360
So it'd be awesome.

28:53.360 --> 28:54.240
Yes, yes, yes.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.360
Arm wrestle now.

28:55.360 --> 28:55.840
You too.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.000
From the spelling of the word.

28:58.000 --> 28:58.640
Yeah.

28:58.640 --> 29:01.040
It was so fun pretending there's only one dictionary.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.720
But I'm going to stop pretending it for this next thing

29:02.720 --> 29:03.440
I'm going to say.

29:03.440 --> 29:03.680
Okay.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.640
You know how there's like different dictionary companies?

29:06.640 --> 29:07.140
What?

29:08.080 --> 29:11.040
No, but there's only one as established.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.320
We're not pretending that anymore.

29:12.320 --> 29:12.800
Oh, okay.

29:13.760 --> 29:18.800
So like, there's like Webster's and Oxford.

29:18.800 --> 29:22.480
Wouldn't it be funny if Webster decided to make,

29:22.480 --> 29:25.600
like change the definition of Oxford in its dictionary?

29:25.600 --> 29:28.080
Just like, oh, at Oxford, that's the Dickey stain

29:28.080 --> 29:28.960
you get on your drawers.

29:28.960 --> 29:32.080
Got them, got them.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.760
Oh, you got an Oxford on there, gross.

29:35.280 --> 29:37.120
Why is there different dictionaries?

29:37.120 --> 29:39.600
Because the words are the same and the definitions are the same.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.240
Is it just you copy and paste the other folks shit

29:42.240 --> 29:43.440
and just put it right in your book?

29:43.440 --> 29:45.040
And it's like, you stole it.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.080
What are you talking about?

29:46.080 --> 29:48.240
I can't steal what Apple means.

29:48.240 --> 29:51.920
It's so they can have an arms race for putting busted new words in

29:51.920 --> 29:57.040
to try to have some like notoriety or like some reason

29:57.040 --> 29:58.160
that the media will talk about.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.400
Like, did you hear staycations in there now?

30:00.400 --> 30:01.200
Like, yeah, fine.

30:01.200 --> 30:01.840
It's so quick.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.000
Yeet goes viral.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.200
And Merriam's like, we got yeet, yeet, yeet, yeet, yeet.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.080
Burn the old ones.

30:10.080 --> 30:10.880
Burn the old ones.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.160
All your old books are bullshit.

30:12.160 --> 30:12.880
Go buy a new one.

30:12.880 --> 30:13.760
It's got yeet.

30:13.760 --> 30:16.800
It's the Merriam-Webster 2018 yeet edition.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.080
Also, we took YOLO out.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.320
Nobody's fucking saying YOLO out.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.200
What are those?

30:23.200 --> 30:23.760
It's done.

30:23.760 --> 30:28.080
Welcome to the Merriam-Webster what's hot, what's not edition.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.640
I would like to make a new better version segment.

30:32.640 --> 30:33.120
Oh, okay.

30:34.800 --> 30:38.480
A new version of the dictionary that just has a different alphabetical order

30:38.480 --> 30:41.600
because alphabetical order is just completely arbitrary as it is.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.240
And I would like to put all the vowels together.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.160
Oh, that's good.

30:46.160 --> 30:48.880
And then, but the whole alphabet starts with T

30:48.880 --> 30:51.040
so that I'll always be first in line for stuff.

30:51.680 --> 30:52.320
That's cool.

30:52.320 --> 30:56.800
And then maybe instead of a song that we teach our children,

30:57.520 --> 31:00.400
you just say the alphabet like it's one big word.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.360
I like that.

31:01.360 --> 31:01.760
So it's like-

31:01.760 --> 31:02.480
Since the beginning.

31:02.480 --> 31:03.360
And then all the vowels.

31:03.360 --> 31:03.680
So it's like-

31:03.680 --> 31:04.320
And then all the vowels.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.320
Like that, and then kids say it and it helps them learn.

31:10.320 --> 31:11.680
Like a Missy Elliott song.

31:12.320 --> 31:12.720
Yeah.

31:12.720 --> 31:15.680
Well, you know that not all her songs are like-

31:15.680 --> 31:16.160
What?

31:16.160 --> 31:16.480
Once-

31:17.040 --> 31:20.720
Yeah, not all of her songs feature her sort of saying things backwards.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.160
You know that, right?

31:22.160 --> 31:23.360
It's not a gimmick.

31:23.360 --> 31:23.680
It's just one thing.

31:23.680 --> 31:24.480
It's not a gimmick.

31:24.480 --> 31:27.200
She's not the backward song singer.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.680
She just really has the one where that's sort of the focus.

31:30.240 --> 31:30.560
Okay.

31:31.360 --> 31:33.120
Well, sure.

31:33.920 --> 31:37.120
If you want to just step on my joke.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.640
Joke's kind of a strong word.

31:38.640 --> 31:42.960
Let's take a break now and head on over to the Money Zone.

31:42.960 --> 31:43.680
Already, huh?

31:43.680 --> 31:46.480
Wow, that what would you do segment sure took a while, huh?

31:46.480 --> 31:47.760
It was what do you think you would do?

31:47.760 --> 31:56.720
There's no copyright in French in here.

32:00.720 --> 32:03.840
Folks, I want to take a moment to ask if you are hiring,

32:03.840 --> 32:06.960
because time's tight over here and I could use a gig.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.760
Posting your position to job sites.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.040
That's what you do normally.

32:11.040 --> 32:11.840
And then what do you do?

32:11.840 --> 32:14.880
You wait, you wait, you wait for the right people to see it.

32:14.880 --> 32:18.960
Well, no more waiting because Zip Recruiter has revolutionized hiring.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.920
Their technology finds great candidates for you.

32:21.920 --> 32:22.800
It kicks open their door.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.000
It grabs them by the scruff of their neck.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.520
It drags them into your desk.

32:25.520 --> 32:28.720
It tapes them there with duct tape and it makes them answer your questions.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.800
It learns that you're looking for it,

32:30.800 --> 32:33.120
identifies people with the right experience and invites them to apply.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.040
What kind of experience do you think you look for

32:35.040 --> 32:37.040
for people to write a dictionary for you?

32:37.040 --> 32:39.360
Like if you were hiring dictionary writers,

32:39.360 --> 32:41.440
that's such a specialized skill set.

32:41.440 --> 32:44.080
Yeah, what's the deal with that?

32:45.120 --> 32:46.560
Do you think that there are dictionaries

32:46.560 --> 32:48.560
that also include some sort of narrative?

32:49.280 --> 32:51.200
We did dictionaries already, Travis.

32:51.200 --> 32:53.760
We're in the body of the advertisement now.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.920
But now I'm thinking about if we wrote a dictionary,

32:55.920 --> 32:59.120
but there was a story that unfolded as you read the dictionary.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.160
That could be fun.

33:00.160 --> 33:00.480
Okay.

33:01.360 --> 33:02.640
Hey, peepums nasty.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.160
Peepums, as long as we're doing all the big bits,

33:04.160 --> 33:05.040
peepums nasty gun.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.160
Let's check in on that one.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.480
Right now, our listeners can try for free

33:10.480 --> 33:13.040
at ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

33:13.040 --> 33:15.200
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

33:15.840 --> 33:17.840
ZipRecruiter, the smartest way to hire.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.640
Hey, Pamela, how's our new spot on the bim-bam?

33:20.640 --> 33:21.600
Well, it's long.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.160
It's not really about us for much of it,

33:26.160 --> 33:27.520
but it is a long spot.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.080
I want to tell you about Squarespace.

33:30.080 --> 33:30.800
From those boys.

33:31.520 --> 33:33.200
Now, I want to tell you about Squarespace.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.560
And also probably Glass Sharks at some point.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.320
Glass Sharks can come in there.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.000
Well, I'm going to reference something

33:40.000 --> 33:41.360
I referenced earlier in the podcast.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.360
And that is we were talking about the tours.

33:43.360 --> 33:45.360
And we said macroshows.com slash tours.

33:45.360 --> 33:46.640
And I said, yeah, I can put that up there.

33:46.640 --> 33:47.760
That'll be up by the time.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.600
That's because we use Squarespace.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.320
And Squarespace is so intuitive and easy to use

33:52.320 --> 33:54.240
that I can make changes wherever I need to,

33:54.800 --> 33:57.280
update stuff rapidly and on my own schedule

33:57.280 --> 34:00.160
without having to wait for some huge,

34:00.160 --> 34:03.520
I don't know, website producing machine

34:03.520 --> 34:05.200
to make the website for me.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.560
I can do it.

34:06.560 --> 34:08.240
And if you have a cool idea

34:08.240 --> 34:11.360
or something you want to create a web presence for,

34:11.360 --> 34:12.960
make a new website on Squarespace.

34:12.960 --> 34:13.920
It's super easy.

34:14.640 --> 34:16.080
They have beautiful templates

34:16.080 --> 34:17.840
created by world-class designers.

34:17.840 --> 34:20.400
They also have e-commerce functionality.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.720
So if you want to sell things, you can do that.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.920
And it's optimized for mobile right out of the box.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.440
You don't even have to do anything

34:27.440 --> 34:29.280
so people can use it on their smartphones.

34:29.280 --> 34:30.880
Travis mentioned that quick iteration.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.000
It really is awesome.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.040
Like hypothetically, you could put on like a contact page

34:35.040 --> 34:38.160
on like a personal website where people could email you.

34:38.160 --> 34:41.040
And then when like 200 people send you emails

34:41.040 --> 34:44.240
about BananaVore, you can just delete that instantly.

34:44.240 --> 34:45.920
And like, it's not even a big deal

34:45.920 --> 34:47.440
and nobody even notices.

34:47.440 --> 34:49.040
And they help you buy domains

34:49.040 --> 34:51.040
and they have a ton of extensions to use

34:51.040 --> 34:53.600
and there's nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.560
So go check out Squarespace.com for a free trial.

34:56.560 --> 34:57.760
And when you're ready to launch,

34:57.760 --> 35:00.400
use the offer code MYBROTHER to save 10%

35:00.400 --> 35:02.960
off your first purchase of a website or domain.

35:02.960 --> 35:06.240
That's Squarespace.com and enter the code MYBROTHER,

35:06.240 --> 35:06.960
all one word.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.800
I want to tell you all about an exciting new podcast

35:10.800 --> 35:13.840
that is called Talk From Superheroes.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.200
It is a new podcast.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.960
It's hosted by Andrew and Diana,

35:16.960 --> 35:19.600
the creators of Texts From Superheroes,

35:19.600 --> 35:21.280
that hilarious web comic you've seen

35:21.280 --> 35:22.800
where superheroes text each other.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.480
Every week on Talk From Superheroes,

35:24.480 --> 35:26.720
they break down the hilarious things you've never noticed

35:26.720 --> 35:28.560
in superhero movies and TV shows.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.280
Like how Green Goblin's glider definitely cut off his junk

35:31.280 --> 35:32.960
in 2002's Spider-Man.

35:32.960 --> 35:37.200
Man of Steel is about how to insert a space USB

35:37.200 --> 35:40.720
and how Tony Stark recruited a child soldier in Civil War.

35:40.720 --> 35:41.600
Oh my goodness.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.440
Yeah, I think all that probably does track.

35:44.480 --> 35:47.200
A lot of just sort of probably I bet like

35:47.920 --> 35:53.040
snafus, continuity errors, a lot of outtakes,

35:53.600 --> 35:56.320
a lot of probably some plot holes, gang.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.240
And so gird yourself for that.

35:58.240 --> 36:02.080
But it's all on TalkFromSuperheroes.com

36:02.080 --> 36:04.320
or you can also just search for Talk From Superheroes

36:04.320 --> 36:07.120
on iTunes or wherever you listen to podcasts.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.200
I think that means like whatever application you use

36:11.200 --> 36:14.400
to download the podcast and not like a nice tree

36:14.400 --> 36:18.000
like to sit under or over in a hot air balloon

36:18.000 --> 36:19.600
and enjoy listening to your podcasts.

36:19.600 --> 36:29.360
Yes, this is from Anna Heavens and it's for Smooch Island.

36:29.360 --> 36:32.000
Hey Smoochers, what a year it's been.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Thank you for being part of a community

36:34.000 --> 36:36.320
where it's normal to build internet friendships,

36:36.320 --> 36:39.040
do some flirts, get some selfie validation

36:39.040 --> 36:41.840
and maybe even experience some island magic.

36:41.840 --> 36:45.200
To Jack, Almay, Jenny, Mo and John,

36:45.840 --> 36:48.880
you are the best mods and people I know.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.960
Thank you for everything.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.920
I love y'all, keep smooching.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.520
What is Smooch Island?

36:55.520 --> 36:59.840
I don't know but I'm so excited to get to say it

36:59.840 --> 37:01.680
and just be there.

37:01.680 --> 37:02.960
You can't be there, it's like lost.

37:04.160 --> 37:05.280
It's always moving.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.520
There's a scary polar bear

37:07.520 --> 37:12.560
and there's a big cloud that comes around and kills people.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.720
But aside from that, it's great.

37:14.720 --> 37:15.840
Everybody's smooching all the time.

37:15.840 --> 37:18.160
Now why didn't you go with Fantasy Island, Griffin?

37:18.160 --> 37:20.720
Because it seems more like Fantasy Island.

37:20.720 --> 37:22.880
Nope, it's the lost island, bears and everything.

37:22.880 --> 37:25.040
Sawyer's there, Sawyer's there, but he's kissing.

37:25.840 --> 37:26.480
He's kissing?

37:26.480 --> 37:28.640
Oh, so you can smooch Sawyer, that helps.

37:28.640 --> 37:29.040
Hell yeah.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.200
That really takes the edge off the smoke monster.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.200
I'll say this, smooch Sawyer doesn't hurt.

37:34.640 --> 37:36.080
Well, he's got a lot of stubble.

37:36.080 --> 37:36.720
You might get some hurt.

37:36.720 --> 37:37.920
Oh, it would.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.440
You gonna read this next one, Trav?

37:39.440 --> 37:44.480
Sure, this is from Wes Davies and it's for Robin Phelan.

37:44.480 --> 37:47.600
Dear Robin Phelan, fantastic DM

37:47.600 --> 37:49.520
and even more fantastic friend.

37:49.520 --> 37:53.520
Reese and Wes, Inya and Francie, Sin and Amy,

37:53.520 --> 37:56.800
Rizza and Luca, Kuviri and Juniper,

37:57.360 --> 37:58.480
Way and Iris.

37:59.520 --> 38:00.480
Why is it written like this, Wes?

38:00.480 --> 38:03.600
This is the biggest D&D group fucking ever.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.680
Maybe that's their, that's probably the player.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.440
Wait, is that the player?

38:07.440 --> 38:08.960
Player and the, I don't know.

38:08.960 --> 38:09.920
Character and the player?

38:09.920 --> 38:10.960
I don't know.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.120
They all send you our love

38:13.120 --> 38:15.360
and thank you for the zags, the gays,

38:15.360 --> 38:17.520
and for all the kindness you put into the stories

38:17.520 --> 38:18.640
you give to us.

38:18.640 --> 38:21.760
May they continue to heal us and you every month.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.880
You are so loved.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.680
And that message is set to air whenever.

38:26.560 --> 38:27.680
I like it.

38:27.680 --> 38:28.560
I like it.

38:28.560 --> 38:31.600
There's never a bad time to thank your DM

38:33.040 --> 38:34.480
for their hard, hard work.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.400
I agree, Griffin.

38:37.200 --> 38:38.000
Thank you, Travis.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.320
Hi, I'm Ellie Gertz.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.440
And I'm Julia Prescott,

38:43.440 --> 38:46.000
and we're the hosts of Everything's Coming Up Simpsons.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.440
We are a Simpsons podcast,

38:47.440 --> 38:49.280
brand new to the Maximum Fun Network.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.760
And every episode we cover a different episode

38:51.760 --> 38:54.800
of The Simpsons that is a favorite of our special guests.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.880
We've had guests that are showrunners and writers

38:56.880 --> 38:58.800
and voice actors like Nancy Cartwright,

38:58.800 --> 39:00.240
all people that have worked on The Simpsons.

39:00.240 --> 39:02.080
And we've also had guests like Weird Al

39:02.080 --> 39:04.560
and people that are on the Maximum Fun Network already.

39:04.560 --> 39:07.120
And each week we will talk to a very cool guest

39:07.120 --> 39:08.160
about their favorite episode.

39:08.160 --> 39:09.120
And it is so much fun.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.160
So if you like The Simpsons,

39:10.160 --> 39:12.240
come listen to Everything's Coming Up Simpsons.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.360
All right, smell you later.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.200
My friend won't let up

39:19.200 --> 39:21.760
about the existence of airline hitchhikers,

39:21.760 --> 39:24.960
people that stow away in the baggage place of an airplane

39:24.960 --> 39:26.880
and look through the paying passengers things

39:26.880 --> 39:28.000
during the flight.

39:28.000 --> 39:28.640
According to her,

39:28.640 --> 39:31.120
they sneak on while the terminal loads in the baggage,

39:31.120 --> 39:32.480
nobody the wiser.

39:32.480 --> 39:33.920
This only came up when I asked

39:33.920 --> 39:35.680
why she was putting those miniature key locks

39:35.680 --> 39:37.600
on every single zipper for checked bag,

39:37.600 --> 39:39.200
as I thought she was more hesitant

39:39.200 --> 39:40.960
about them opening during flight

39:40.960 --> 39:44.400
instead of hitchhikers digging through her socks

39:44.400 --> 39:45.360
or something.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.920
How can I convince her that these airplane stowaways

39:47.920 --> 39:51.360
don't exist and are not looking through luggage

39:51.360 --> 39:54.000
and she doesn't need a dozen locks on her suitcase?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.320
And that's from Surprised in Sarasota.

39:56.320 --> 39:57.200
Of course, yes.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.520
This is obviously ridiculous

39:59.520 --> 40:03.040
because people sneak on the plane inside the luggage,

40:03.040 --> 40:04.480
not while it's being loaded.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.400
Don't be ridiculous.

40:06.400 --> 40:09.680
And then when they put the luggage through the x-ray

40:09.680 --> 40:12.640
and they get stopped like, hey, we saw some weird shit

40:12.640 --> 40:16.320
and you can be like, no, no, no, it's just a skeleton.

40:16.320 --> 40:16.820
Yep.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.520
I'm fine if there's airplane hitchhikers.

40:21.520 --> 40:26.480
If that's the point that we're at, that's fine.

40:26.480 --> 40:28.800
Can I please leave my shoes on then?

40:29.600 --> 40:31.360
If you are gonna let people climb on

40:31.360 --> 40:34.720
and dig through people's bags with their sticky fingers,

40:34.720 --> 40:38.160
can I please just leave the shoes on maybe?

40:38.160 --> 40:39.120
Would that be okay?

40:39.120 --> 40:41.520
They're prescription shoes, TSA.

40:42.240 --> 40:45.760
Justin, you used the word let in the air

40:45.760 --> 40:49.680
and it did occur to me that if this was truly a problem

40:49.680 --> 40:51.440
and there were airline hitchhikers

40:51.440 --> 40:54.080
and so airlines were just like, what are you gonna do?

40:54.080 --> 40:56.880
Listen, we can't stop it every day.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.960
We open the doors, oh, dang it.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.080
Everybody's clothes are everywhere.

41:00.080 --> 41:01.840
They got us again, the airline hitchhiker.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.480
And they've just accepted that it's an inevitability.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.080
You can't stop these sky pirates.

41:06.080 --> 41:06.720
You know what I mean?

41:06.720 --> 41:07.200
It happens.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.760
That is what I am implying, yes.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.680
I don't think that it would continue to be.

41:11.680 --> 41:14.000
They don't let me on wearing my shoes.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.680
You do get a chance to put,

41:18.320 --> 41:20.000
you know that once you go through security,

41:20.000 --> 41:21.840
you can put the shoes back on and you don't.

41:22.400 --> 41:22.720
What?

41:23.280 --> 41:24.240
Wait a minute.

41:24.240 --> 41:27.760
Wait, I thought you left them off so you got home.

41:27.760 --> 41:30.160
Are you the stink feet man I've been reading about?

41:31.280 --> 41:33.440
I've been seeing articles pop up on Time,

41:33.440 --> 41:38.880
the Wall Street Journal, all the big blogs

41:40.160 --> 41:42.720
about the stink feet man who goes on the plane

41:42.720 --> 41:44.240
and doesn't wear the shoes

41:44.240 --> 41:48.880
and then just sort of makes the plane his space with the smell.

41:49.840 --> 41:53.280
The worst thing I think about having to take your shoes off

41:53.280 --> 41:56.960
at the airport and it's a huge inconvenience obviously,

41:56.960 --> 42:01.440
but if you think about it, if you're a sane human being,

42:01.440 --> 42:07.360
you go to get on the airplane and serve your kickoff buddies,

42:07.360 --> 42:11.520
your buddies that you can just slip right off.

42:11.520 --> 42:14.400
And then what happens?

42:14.400 --> 42:17.680
Well, the terrible side effect is you've now loaded up

42:17.680 --> 42:20.880
an airplane with people that are wearing the shoes

42:20.880 --> 42:24.160
that are most easily kicked off.

42:24.160 --> 42:26.640
Like most easy, just like kick off and relax.

42:26.640 --> 42:28.880
You're kickoff buddies and you're wearing them.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.480
It's a whole plane.

42:30.480 --> 42:36.160
We have like normalized taking your shoes off in an airplane

42:36.160 --> 42:38.080
because everybody's wearing the shoes

42:38.080 --> 42:40.800
that are so easy to slip on and off.

42:40.800 --> 42:42.720
They should make you wear your most difficult.

42:42.720 --> 42:44.960
Everybody should have to wear their steampunk boots

42:44.960 --> 42:48.560
that lace up to the knee that require two friends

42:48.560 --> 42:49.760
to help you get on and off.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.280
Your Dom boots.

42:51.280 --> 42:55.040
Yeah, I'm actually sitting here right now

42:55.040 --> 42:57.120
looking at my steampunk boots

42:57.120 --> 42:58.880
and that is where that reference came from.

42:58.880 --> 43:02.000
Yeah, the only hero of my brother, my brother.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.040
That's probably not true.

43:03.040 --> 43:03.840
This is a podcast.

43:03.840 --> 43:05.040
There's probably a lot of podcasters

43:05.040 --> 43:06.320
who have steampunk boots.

43:07.120 --> 43:10.400
If only there was a word for people who hide

43:11.040 --> 43:16.640
in the like the secret spaces of modes of transit

43:17.200 --> 43:19.520
because Airline Hitchhikers is kind of a mouthful.

43:19.520 --> 43:21.120
When they first said Airline Hitchhikers,

43:21.120 --> 43:23.280
it made me picture someone on a cloud like-

43:23.280 --> 43:25.200
Yeah, someone like on a hot air balloon

43:25.200 --> 43:26.320
with their thumb out and they're like,

43:26.320 --> 43:27.280
I gotta get to Phoenix,

43:27.280 --> 43:28.560
but I don't have a whole lot of money.

43:28.560 --> 43:29.440
Okay, here it comes.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.280
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

43:33.120 --> 43:34.720
That's kind of what the little prince did.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.720
You know, the comments weren't into that.

43:36.720 --> 43:37.920
Comments weren't asked.

43:37.920 --> 43:42.560
The gremlin with the Shatner episode of Twilight Zone.

43:42.560 --> 43:43.760
Thank you, Travis.

43:43.760 --> 43:44.800
How about a yahoo?

43:46.160 --> 43:48.000
Yeah, can I just mention one other thing?

43:48.720 --> 43:52.240
The lid of my coffee mug stinks.

43:53.040 --> 43:54.080
You wash it?

43:54.080 --> 43:55.520
Yeah, I wash it every day

43:55.520 --> 43:59.680
and it's just the lid, the top of the lid of it stinks.

44:00.560 --> 44:01.840
Wait, it stinks like plastic?

44:01.840 --> 44:03.120
Because that's the thing I don't care for

44:03.120 --> 44:04.640
in the tumblers.

44:04.640 --> 44:06.160
It's a travel tumbler.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.680
That's the only thing I use to travel.

44:07.680 --> 44:09.920
I never, here's a fun fact about me.

44:10.560 --> 44:12.240
I don't leave the house as a rule.

44:13.120 --> 44:15.360
Don't pour my coffee in anything but travel mugs

44:15.360 --> 44:18.240
because if you're using a regular mug to drink your coffee,

44:18.240 --> 44:19.760
it is cold instantly.

44:20.640 --> 44:21.600
When I dump it into this,

44:22.400 --> 44:24.880
when I dump it into the Kotigo auto seal though,

44:24.880 --> 44:26.560
it's gonna stay warm for longer.

44:26.560 --> 44:29.680
So I always do that except the lid of this Kotigo auto seal

44:29.680 --> 44:33.840
smells so bad that I'm gonna throw the stink in

44:33.840 --> 44:35.200
and I'm gonna throw it away.

44:35.200 --> 44:36.880
What kind of stink, Justin?

44:36.880 --> 44:37.920
Let's get in there.

44:37.920 --> 44:38.720
I don't wanna know.

44:38.720 --> 44:39.680
Is it the stink like a dirty lid?

44:39.680 --> 44:42.080
Veto, veto, veto, blackball, blackball, blackball.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.520
Don't wanna hear about Justin's mouth stink.

44:43.520 --> 44:44.560
No way, veto.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.560
It is no way this is from me.

44:46.560 --> 44:47.600
This is not my brand.

44:47.600 --> 44:50.240
Is it just the material of the lid you don't care for?

44:50.240 --> 44:53.680
It's like it's a porous material that has absorbed stink

44:53.680 --> 44:55.360
at some point in the dishwashing process.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.880
What kind of stink, Justin?

44:58.000 --> 45:04.000
I mean, it's an earthy, mellow stink.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.680
It's just like an old laundry stink.

45:07.680 --> 45:11.440
Kind of a musty old laundry stink on my Kotigo auto seal.

45:11.440 --> 45:14.480
How's the mouth feel?

45:14.480 --> 45:20.960
I mean, there's no sensory input in terms of tactile or taste.

45:20.960 --> 45:23.840
It's purely an olfactory issue.

45:23.840 --> 45:28.960
But with every drink, I'm like rubbing my nose in the stink

45:28.960 --> 45:30.720
while I'm trying to drink my coffee.

45:30.720 --> 45:32.480
Have you thought about just boiling the lid?

45:34.800 --> 45:36.400
I just took another drink.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.400
Stop taking drinks of it, Justin.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.720
I need it to do the comedy.

45:42.400 --> 45:43.040
How about this Yahoo?

45:43.040 --> 45:44.400
What do you think you would do, Liv?

45:44.400 --> 45:45.360
Oh, fuck, for Christ's sake.

45:45.360 --> 45:47.600
You need coffee to do your comedy.

45:47.600 --> 45:48.880
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in.

45:48.880 --> 45:50.960
Thank you, Adrian Cowles, for sending this in.

45:50.960 --> 45:52.960
Yahoo answers user Jason, who asks,

45:54.400 --> 45:55.760
what's your power meal?

45:57.040 --> 45:59.520
Update, update, I have two.

45:59.520 --> 46:01.760
15 bean soup and vegan chili.

46:02.480 --> 46:03.760
15 beans?

46:04.800 --> 46:07.360
That's 15 different kinds of beans, right?

46:07.360 --> 46:08.880
Not just like 15 beans.

46:08.880 --> 46:11.680
I think it's 15 beans because it's all that your,

46:11.680 --> 46:13.120
you know, all that your village had

46:13.120 --> 46:14.480
and you put it in there with the water

46:14.480 --> 46:16.960
and then everybody kind of makes up an imagination thing

46:16.960 --> 46:17.600
they put in there.

46:17.600 --> 46:19.280
And then at the end, you eat it and you're like,

46:19.280 --> 46:22.000
mm, my favorite, my favorite soup.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.120
But then you're like,

46:23.120 --> 46:24.960
we all know that this tastes like shit, right?

46:25.600 --> 46:27.360
Jeremy put a fucking rock in here

46:27.360 --> 46:29.920
and said it was like a magic rock that tasted good.

46:29.920 --> 46:32.400
But we can all agree that this is fucking gross, right?

46:32.400 --> 46:32.640
Okay.

46:33.440 --> 46:34.880
What's your power meal, though?

46:34.880 --> 46:35.680
What do you eat?

46:36.480 --> 46:39.120
I thought about this because I've reached a point now

46:39.120 --> 46:42.800
where there's very little food that makes me not want to either

46:42.800 --> 46:46.080
one, go to sleep or two, go to sleep on a toilet.

46:46.080 --> 46:49.760
And I don't know that food makes me feel powerful anymore

46:49.760 --> 46:53.680
as much as it makes me feel sad.

46:53.680 --> 46:56.960
So this isn't like your favorite happy comfort meal, right?

46:56.960 --> 46:59.280
Because for me, that's far too much fried chicken

46:59.280 --> 47:01.360
and cheesecake that does not make me feel powerful.

47:01.360 --> 47:02.480
No, not powerful.

47:02.480 --> 47:03.200
Not powerful.

47:03.200 --> 47:06.400
I'm talking about, I'm about to go fucking play paintball

47:06.400 --> 47:08.720
and I need to load up

47:09.280 --> 47:12.400
and I'm gonna get out there and play paintball

47:12.400 --> 47:13.280
and I need to load up.

47:13.280 --> 47:15.920
And so like, what's the meal I eat before then?

47:15.920 --> 47:18.560
So I can feel powerful so I can do all my cool

47:18.560 --> 47:20.400
like knee slide John Woo shit.

47:22.400 --> 47:25.760
And I'm saying I don't know because there's literally nothing.

47:27.120 --> 47:30.960
I mean, if you get me, okay, here's what it is for me.

47:32.320 --> 47:36.000
Salad, but like, staked out.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.600
Like tons of steak.

47:38.240 --> 47:39.760
Maybe you put a bunch of steak on salad.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.440
Oh, not like a salad you've been watching for weeks.

47:41.440 --> 47:44.400
No, to make sure nobody is tampered with it

47:44.400 --> 47:46.320
and make sure it's not falsifying documents.

47:47.040 --> 47:50.160
Yes, no, a steak salad because it's like,

47:50.160 --> 47:53.040
it blasts you with veggies and you love that raw energy,

47:53.040 --> 47:54.560
but then right behind it,

47:54.560 --> 47:56.720
it's got the protein there to kind of scoop you up.

47:56.720 --> 47:57.760
To make you go crazy.

47:57.760 --> 47:59.520
Yeah, that's what makes you go crazy.

48:02.240 --> 48:04.880
The other thing that I definitely would include in there

48:04.880 --> 48:05.840
is hot sauce.

48:05.840 --> 48:06.560
Like if you-

48:06.560 --> 48:08.720
Oh God, no, the power's gone, Justin.

48:08.720 --> 48:09.520
That's all I use.

48:10.080 --> 48:11.280
I don't use salad dressing.

48:11.280 --> 48:13.040
I use hot sauce on my salads.

48:13.040 --> 48:14.880
It turns you into a sports car.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.080
A what?

48:16.080 --> 48:18.480
It turns you into a sports car so you can go fast.

48:18.480 --> 48:20.880
And so there's our legally mandated-

48:20.880 --> 48:22.000
Every 100 episodes.

48:22.000 --> 48:22.800
Turbo Teen.

48:24.080 --> 48:26.160
Travis, if you think we referenced Turbo Teen

48:26.160 --> 48:29.280
every 100 episodes, you are out of your fucking mind.

48:29.280 --> 48:29.920
Fair enough.

48:29.920 --> 48:31.040
Justin, mine is similar,

48:31.040 --> 48:33.520
but mine is more contextual salad

48:33.520 --> 48:37.440
where it has to be like surprise, good decision salad.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.320
Okay, yes.

48:38.320 --> 48:39.200
You know, where it's like,

48:39.200 --> 48:41.680
oh, I'm feeling a little sluggish, right?

48:41.680 --> 48:43.520
I can't plan on having the salad,

48:43.520 --> 48:44.800
but I have to in the moment we're like,

48:44.800 --> 48:45.360
you know what?

48:45.360 --> 48:46.560
I mean, I have a salad.

48:46.560 --> 48:49.280
And that is like, it sneaks up on me

48:49.280 --> 48:50.960
and we go on an adventure together

48:50.960 --> 48:53.040
where I feel like I've made a good choice.

48:53.040 --> 48:53.360
And I feel better.

48:53.360 --> 48:55.360
That happens to be on tour sometimes.

48:55.360 --> 48:57.760
On tour sometimes like around the last show,

48:58.480 --> 49:00.560
Paul will be like, let's get that dinner order in.

49:00.560 --> 49:02.640
I'm like, you know what I'm gonna go with?

49:02.640 --> 49:04.880
And he like turns to me really slowly.

49:04.880 --> 49:07.600
And he's like, Justin, you don't mean a...

49:07.600 --> 49:08.960
And I'm like, yeah, Paul, I do.

49:08.960 --> 49:10.880
A salad.

49:10.880 --> 49:13.120
I mean, everybody on the crew,

49:13.120 --> 49:14.480
like rushes into the green room,

49:14.480 --> 49:15.840
which is against our writer.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.440
And everybody in the crew rushes in the green room

49:17.440 --> 49:19.840
and they just started applauding and screaming,

49:19.840 --> 49:21.440
like flinging things everywhere.

49:23.200 --> 49:25.120
That is a thing that happens all three of us.

49:25.120 --> 49:28.320
It'll be like, it's as if someone just suggested

49:28.320 --> 49:30.880
like a dessert where I'm like, oh, a salad.

49:30.880 --> 49:33.040
Actually, yeah, I changed my salad too.

49:34.640 --> 49:35.840
I can't, but I can't even,

49:35.840 --> 49:37.680
salad's not even great for me anymore

49:37.680 --> 49:40.800
because it shows up in my tummy.

49:40.800 --> 49:45.280
And like my tummy workers, like Bill is like,

49:45.920 --> 49:48.240
Susan, I don't even know what to do with this stuff.

49:48.240 --> 49:50.160
And Susan's like, yeah, I don't know either.

49:50.160 --> 49:52.560
Let's just get it out of here as fast as we possibly can.

49:53.440 --> 49:56.080
Griffin, I feel like science needs to develop for you

49:56.080 --> 49:58.640
some kind of like gray liquid

49:58.640 --> 50:01.360
that gives you all the sustenance that you need

50:01.360 --> 50:02.800
and the energy you need,

50:02.800 --> 50:05.440
but maybe you don't even notice you're eating it at the time.

50:05.440 --> 50:08.080
That might be the only thing your stomach

50:08.080 --> 50:11.200
is able to process now is my worry.

50:11.200 --> 50:13.040
Might be good, because right now my plan is like,

50:13.600 --> 50:16.880
I see a healthy salad and I see some mozzarella sticks

50:16.880 --> 50:19.040
and I'm like, both of these are gonna make me feel bad.

50:19.040 --> 50:20.640
I may as well have a good time in the mouth.

50:21.680 --> 50:22.880
Have you tried Soylent?

50:26.640 --> 50:30.320
They named their company after the thing

50:30.320 --> 50:32.560
where they killed people to turn them into food.

50:32.560 --> 50:33.280
Spoilers.

50:33.280 --> 50:35.360
It's just wild to me.

50:35.360 --> 50:38.080
It's like if Pepperidge Farms changed their name

50:38.080 --> 50:39.920
to Silence of the Lambs.

50:39.920 --> 50:41.760
You can't just, gang?

50:41.760 --> 50:45.440
Every one of our delicious boxes

50:45.440 --> 50:47.840
comes with our hickory-smoked fingers.

50:47.840 --> 50:48.640
Wait.

50:48.640 --> 50:50.400
Hickory-smoked dude?

50:52.400 --> 50:56.480
It's the wildest like tech bro shit ever to me

50:56.480 --> 50:58.720
where it's just like, yeah, we named it after,

50:58.720 --> 50:59.840
is it people or not?

51:00.560 --> 51:01.680
We'll never tell.

51:01.680 --> 51:02.480
We're fine.

51:02.480 --> 51:04.640
No, we're very successful.

51:04.640 --> 51:07.120
For reasons beyond Griffin's comprehension.

51:07.760 --> 51:09.440
Could you tell, actually?

51:09.440 --> 51:11.600
Could you actually tell real quick?

51:11.600 --> 51:13.920
Because like, I don't know if you've seen out there,

51:13.920 --> 51:16.880
but a company that called itself after the food drink,

51:16.880 --> 51:20.080
the maid of people, and then they did do it

51:20.080 --> 51:22.560
on the rankings of the past few years,

51:22.560 --> 51:27.600
I would be like, a seven, maybe a seven, maybe.

51:27.600 --> 51:29.840
You might trend for like an hour.

51:29.840 --> 51:30.720
It's people.

51:30.720 --> 51:31.920
And everyone's like, okay.

51:31.920 --> 51:33.120
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

51:34.720 --> 51:37.040
And it's still, I can just drink it

51:37.040 --> 51:39.600
and I'm good for like the next four or five hours

51:39.600 --> 51:39.920
and I don't-

51:39.920 --> 51:41.920
Yeah, but it's people.

51:41.920 --> 51:43.520
Yeah, but it gives me whatever I need.

51:43.520 --> 51:46.240
But it gives me energy to code.

51:46.240 --> 51:48.720
Yeah, dude, go for it.

51:48.720 --> 51:49.520
It's people.

51:50.640 --> 51:52.160
What is it these days, am I right?

51:52.720 --> 51:55.040
Lots of things, every other thing.

51:55.040 --> 51:57.200
And a banana, an orange.

51:58.320 --> 51:59.200
Who has the time?

51:59.200 --> 52:01.120
The peeling, yuck.

52:01.120 --> 52:03.040
I can't peel, I got a code.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.200
How about another question

52:07.200 --> 52:08.800
or do you wanna Yahoo another one?

52:09.600 --> 52:10.880
Let's, we've only done two questions.

52:10.880 --> 52:12.640
Let's crank one more out here.

52:12.640 --> 52:14.960
I'm a delivery driver for a business in California

52:15.920 --> 52:18.720
that sends marijuana and other THC products

52:18.720 --> 52:20.880
to people's front door, just like pizza.

52:21.360 --> 52:24.000
It's legal here and I absolutely love my job.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.920
Well, yeah, it's a good gig.

52:25.920 --> 52:28.960
Every customer I've ever had has been positive.

52:28.960 --> 52:30.960
They've been polite and happy to see me.

52:30.960 --> 52:34.480
The problem is that sometimes they're too happy to see me

52:34.480 --> 52:36.080
and or they still have the stigma

52:36.080 --> 52:37.920
that our arrangement is something shady

52:37.920 --> 52:39.680
instead of a licensed business.

52:39.680 --> 52:41.040
And they asked me to come inside,

52:41.040 --> 52:42.880
which feels unsafe for me personally,

52:43.920 --> 52:47.280
and unprofessional for a business as legitimate as ours.

52:47.280 --> 52:50.800
How can I let my slightly too friendly customers

52:50.800 --> 52:53.920
down gently so I don't harsh their buzz?

52:53.920 --> 52:55.840
And that's from Weed Man Steve in Sacramento.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.160
Well, Steve, I should clarify what you're doing

52:58.160 --> 52:59.280
is still a federal crime.

52:59.280 --> 53:03.760
So let's not get too uppity.

53:03.760 --> 53:05.520
It's still a federal crime.

53:07.600 --> 53:09.120
Like pirating movies.

53:09.120 --> 53:12.400
Like pirating movies.

53:12.400 --> 53:13.840
What if they asked you to come inside?

53:13.840 --> 53:15.920
You said, oh, that's actually illegal.

53:16.720 --> 53:21.200
What you're doing is this is not going to be a problem

53:21.200 --> 53:22.320
in 20 years.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.320
This is a symptom of-

53:24.320 --> 53:26.080
That doesn't help Steve now.

53:26.080 --> 53:26.480
No, no, no.

53:26.480 --> 53:29.680
I'm just saying that this is a very unique issue

53:29.680 --> 53:30.720
that you are having to solve.

53:31.520 --> 53:34.960
I am saying that there's very little precedent for this

53:34.960 --> 53:36.560
because it is a problem that has only popped up

53:36.560 --> 53:38.320
in the last few years or so.

53:38.320 --> 53:42.000
Where back in the day, you'd call up Todd,

53:42.000 --> 53:43.680
Todd would come over,

53:43.680 --> 53:47.440
slide you some sweet greenie nugs,

53:47.440 --> 53:50.880
and then you'd be expected to play golden eye with Todd

53:50.880 --> 53:53.360
for the next three hours as he enjoys the thing

53:53.360 --> 53:56.560
you just paid for also kind of.

53:56.560 --> 53:59.840
Do you think when they started pizza delivery,

53:59.840 --> 54:01.040
the recipient was like,

54:01.040 --> 54:04.400
are you going to come in and slice it up for me?

54:04.400 --> 54:08.880
Do you want to eat some of it?

54:08.880 --> 54:09.440
Did you bring-

54:09.440 --> 54:12.160
You're probably hungry from walking over here.

54:12.160 --> 54:15.120
Did you bring any arcade games for me to enjoy?

54:15.120 --> 54:18.160
Because usually that's how it works.

54:18.160 --> 54:20.320
I bet early in the day they were like,

54:20.320 --> 54:21.680
listen, we got a whole pizza here.

54:21.680 --> 54:23.680
You should come on in and have some pizza.

54:23.680 --> 54:24.160
Come on in.

54:24.160 --> 54:28.640
I got some new cassettes that we can jam out to

54:29.520 --> 54:31.280
and enjoy my pizza.

54:31.280 --> 54:32.640
Hey, you're not a cop, are you?

54:37.840 --> 54:39.840
This blends so many things for me

54:39.840 --> 54:42.880
of my extreme social anxiety

54:43.760 --> 54:47.760
and just sort of general anxiety about

54:47.760 --> 54:51.440
I guess doing drugs with strangers

54:51.440 --> 54:53.360
is probably a good one to have.

54:54.640 --> 54:55.520
It sounds solid.

54:58.320 --> 54:59.040
What can we do?

54:59.040 --> 55:00.000
What can they do?

55:00.000 --> 55:02.480
It makes me wonder if this person was like,

55:03.120 --> 55:04.320
okay, get in here.

55:04.320 --> 55:05.760
And you said like, no, thank you.

55:06.400 --> 55:07.680
No, thanks.

55:07.680 --> 55:10.480
And they're like, oh, okay.

55:12.880 --> 55:15.360
Well, then let me get this transaction done

55:15.360 --> 55:17.520
as quickly as possible then, I guess.

55:17.520 --> 55:19.600
I can't say I wouldn't be that person though

55:19.600 --> 55:22.480
because my gratitude would be enormous.

55:22.480 --> 55:23.520
I'm extremely thankful

55:23.520 --> 55:25.280
when the pizza delivery person shows up

55:25.280 --> 55:26.400
and gives me the pizza.

55:26.960 --> 55:30.000
And I imagine that if the weed delivery person

55:30.000 --> 55:31.920
had showed up before the pizza delivery person,

55:31.920 --> 55:34.400
I would be exponentially more grateful

55:34.400 --> 55:35.520
towards the pizza one.

55:37.040 --> 55:39.520
I think I would also probably invite them in

55:39.520 --> 55:42.160
and give them some sort of like, I don't know, dowry.

55:42.160 --> 55:43.680
You've done a great service for me.

55:44.480 --> 55:46.400
I've been experiencing this from a different direction.

55:46.400 --> 55:49.440
I've been using DoorDash and DoorDash is like,

55:50.160 --> 55:51.760
how lazy are you?

55:51.760 --> 55:54.400
Cause basically you're calling in like a pickup order,

55:55.040 --> 55:56.800
but then you're having someone else

55:56.800 --> 55:59.520
that you do not know pick it up for you for money.

56:00.240 --> 56:02.080
So it's like delivery,

56:02.080 --> 56:05.360
but you have added the step of like saying,

56:05.360 --> 56:07.200
but I'm not gonna go get it.

56:07.200 --> 56:08.880
So it's not delivery.

56:08.880 --> 56:11.600
It's DiGiorno, which is the name of your driver.

56:11.600 --> 56:15.120
My name is Todd DiGiorno and here's your artist.

56:15.120 --> 56:16.800
When Todd DiGiorno brings it to me,

56:17.360 --> 56:20.640
my posture and attitude and tone of voice

56:20.640 --> 56:23.920
can only be described as deeply apologetic.

56:23.920 --> 56:25.520
Yeah, I fucked up.

56:25.520 --> 56:27.200
I should have done this instead of you, Todd DiGiorno.

56:27.200 --> 56:29.040
I know, listen, I know.

56:29.680 --> 56:31.840
I know this is where we're at and I get that.

56:32.400 --> 56:33.360
Oh man.

56:34.080 --> 56:36.240
We literally have said nothing helpful

56:36.240 --> 56:37.840
about what this person can do.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.280
I think you could just say like,

56:43.280 --> 56:47.760
sorry, I've got a lot of other stops.

56:47.760 --> 56:50.000
And then if you could spread some angel wings

56:50.000 --> 56:51.200
and just fly away

56:51.760 --> 56:54.400
and you've left your Mitsubishi eclipse behind,

56:54.400 --> 56:56.080
but you'll come back and get it later.

56:57.280 --> 56:59.520
But I think it's something that just says like,

56:59.520 --> 57:01.600
you can't, do you wanna come in?

57:01.600 --> 57:02.880
You can't hog me, bud.

57:03.600 --> 57:04.640
I got lots of other,

57:04.640 --> 57:06.880
I got lots of other miracles to perform tonight.

57:06.880 --> 57:08.800
What if when they said, do you wanna come in?

57:08.800 --> 57:10.480
You said, oh, I'm wearing a wire.

57:10.480 --> 57:13.680
I'm wearing a wire, why?

57:13.680 --> 57:15.520
Well, cause then they wouldn't want you to come in.

57:16.240 --> 57:19.040
Oh, so you're assuming they're already kind of high.

57:19.760 --> 57:23.120
So you could say like, I can't, I heard some cops.

57:23.120 --> 57:27.040
And then you just kind of leave.

57:27.040 --> 57:28.640
I can't go in, I'm a cop.

57:28.640 --> 57:30.960
Yeah, as long as you're playing into those stereotypes,

57:30.960 --> 57:32.400
you can just reach into your pocket

57:32.400 --> 57:34.080
and take out a fist full of combos

57:34.080 --> 57:35.840
that you kind of throw behind them.

57:35.840 --> 57:38.400
And then you can run away as they fiendishly

57:38.400 --> 57:41.280
chomp down on these floor combos.

57:42.000 --> 57:47.120
These weed rats, these druggie waste-oids.

57:48.400 --> 57:49.280
I think that's helpful.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.280
Yeah, that probably helps.

57:51.280 --> 57:53.120
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

57:53.120 --> 57:55.120
We got a couple of other things to talk to you about.

57:55.120 --> 57:57.040
First one is our new merch store.

57:57.040 --> 57:58.320
If you're listening to this on Monday,

57:58.320 --> 58:00.640
it could be launching today, maybe tomorrow,

58:00.640 --> 58:01.840
definitely this week.

58:01.840 --> 58:05.920
It'll be at McElroyMerch.com when it is live and working.

58:05.920 --> 58:08.080
We'll tweet about it and Facebook about it

58:08.080 --> 58:09.200
and all that other good stuff.

58:09.920 --> 58:12.720
There's gonna be a ton of new fun items on there.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.080
A lot to discover and explore.

58:16.080 --> 58:18.480
There's a ton of new items on there

58:18.480 --> 58:21.040
as well as items we have offered before.

58:21.040 --> 58:24.720
And so I'm super excited for everybody to see these.

58:24.720 --> 58:26.640
There's some really cool stuff on here.

58:27.200 --> 58:29.840
We're actually partnering on this with DFTBA.

58:29.840 --> 58:30.640
Don't forget to be awesome.

58:30.640 --> 58:34.720
This is John Hank Green's business interests.

58:34.720 --> 58:36.000
They've got a lot of other great creators

58:36.000 --> 58:38.320
on there like Hannah Hart and Extra Credits.

58:42.000 --> 58:42.720
The sequel.

58:42.720 --> 58:43.840
The sequel to Extra Credits.

58:46.400 --> 58:47.600
So we're very excited about that.

58:47.600 --> 58:49.840
And it's McElroyMerch.com.

58:49.840 --> 58:51.840

We are engaging in a special project this week

59:51.440 --> 59:53.600
that we can't give too many details on.

59:54.880 --> 59:56.080
But we need questions.

59:56.080 --> 59:58.400
It's the weirdest thing we've ever done.

59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.080
Yes, hands down.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.960
So we need from you questions, topics directly relating

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:10.080
to like vacation, getting away, relaxing on a beach.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.120
Boat drinks.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.320
That kind of thing.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.960
Boat drinks, sailing.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.840
And you may think you know what it is from this.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.120
Trust me, you don't.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.320
It's weird.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.040
It's weird.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.000
And the good news is you're not gonna have to wait too long

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.600
to listen to it if all goes according to plan.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:33.680
So just send those questions and put in the subject line.

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.960
It's about vacations.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.320
So we know we can find it.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.040

Hey, my name is Jonah Ray.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.240
You might have seen me on the latest season

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.760
of Mystery Science Theater 3000

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.760
or heard me on the Nerdist podcast.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.600
Well, I got a new podcast that's about five years old,

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.440
but we're moving it over to Max Fun,

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.280
along with my friend Cash Hartzell.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.080
Hey, everybody.

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.440
And my other friend, Neil.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:39.920
Hi.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.480
Neil, man.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.520
So it's a music podcast where a lot of people

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.520
just kind of hang out and talk about music,

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.960
but so much more.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.160
We also take submissions.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.960
And we're going to be doing a little bit of music

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.320
and so you can hear your band or our music.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.080
Or both.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.040
Or both of it.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.040
You could do, you could listen to your band,

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.400
play your music.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:00.640
Yeah.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.600
So tune in, why don't you?

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.360
You could find out about some new bands

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.640
and maybe just hear us embarrass ourselves

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.520
as we drink too much.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.240
Not too much.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.720
Well, it's all perspective, isn't it?

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:21.440
Sure is.
