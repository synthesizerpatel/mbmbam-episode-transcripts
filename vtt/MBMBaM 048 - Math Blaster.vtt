WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:49.200
Monday, back where we belong. Monday, Monday.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.240
For those tuning in that didn't hear all the pre-pro we just did, this is our third take

00:56.240 --> 01:01.040
at kicking off this show. Griffin, can you recap for me the last two takes?

01:01.680 --> 01:06.240
The first one was a botched attempt to make a joke about Earth Hour,

01:06.240 --> 01:10.880
and the second one was a far too soon joke about the passing of Elizabeth Taylor.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.880
It wasn't a joke, it was so immoral.

01:13.760 --> 01:17.840
What kind of show is this? I checked on iTunes and it said comedy.

01:19.360 --> 01:24.240
I was laughing. This is My Brother, My Brother Meets an Advice show for the modern era. We take

01:24.240 --> 01:30.480
your questions and we turn them into wisdom. My name is Justin McElroy, I'm your oldest brother.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.680
My name is Travis McElroy and I'm your middlest brother.

01:34.800 --> 01:40.000
My name is Griffin McElroy and I'm the baby. You're adorable, just couldn't be cuter.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.120
Pinch these cheeks.

01:43.760 --> 01:49.120
Let's get right into it. Hey question, is it acceptable to secretly eat my roommate's

01:49.120 --> 01:54.960
Hot Pockets if I do more than my fair share of the household chores? Thanks for your help.

01:55.520 --> 01:56.640
Always hungry.

01:57.360 --> 02:03.600
I like that she lives in an economy where like work equals Hot Pockets. I did a lot of work,

02:03.600 --> 02:07.440
that's about two and a half Hot Pockets. Travis, can you explain to me why

02:08.160 --> 02:12.560
you assume this Hot Pocket burglar is female? How did you make that joke?

02:13.200 --> 02:17.600
I don't know, it's like in Spanish where certain words have like an inherent

02:17.600 --> 02:19.360
second order, that's what this is.

02:19.360 --> 02:22.080
And you're saying, you're saying it's Hot Pockets, right?

02:22.080 --> 02:22.320
Yeah.

02:22.320 --> 02:25.200
Hot Pockets is the, I don't get that at all.

02:25.200 --> 02:29.520
Is Hot Pockets what gets, are you saying, are you saying women are, are genetically

02:30.880 --> 02:33.040
steal Hot Pockets, just steal?

02:33.040 --> 02:37.360
I forgot that Travis also refers to vaginas as Hot Pockets.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.800
Almost exclusively.

02:41.440 --> 02:43.600
Don't get me started on lean pockets.

02:43.600 --> 02:47.840
When I, when I scanned this question, I read it as my mommy's Hot Pockets.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.880
It was way better.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.040
Mommy's Hot Pockets tastes the best.

02:53.040 --> 02:58.480
Here's the thing, if you live with this person and I'm, I'm, I understand your relationship

02:58.480 --> 03:02.800
just by reading this question, like you can tell the, the tenor of, of this relationship.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.160
How could you possibly, he, he is overworked and the other person

03:06.160 --> 03:08.720
has a surplus of Hot Pockets that he may not notice?

03:08.720 --> 03:09.520
No, no, no, no.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.120
That old chestnut.

03:11.120 --> 03:16.320
You gotta get deep, I, I do more than my fair share of the household chores that, that the,

03:16.320 --> 03:19.680
the anger, uh, the, the vitriol is there.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.720
It's present.

03:20.720 --> 03:23.760
And I gotta tell you, if you have that kind of relationship, your roommate already thinks

03:23.760 --> 03:25.040
you're eating the Hot Pockets.

03:25.040 --> 03:25.920
Oh, they do.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.520
Whether you are or not.

03:27.520 --> 03:28.000
Yeah.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.760
Make the punishment fit the crime at least.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.680
Get up on the Hot Pockets.

03:31.680 --> 03:32.720
Eat her, her what?

03:32.720 --> 03:34.000
Her breakfast pastries?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.280
Her toaster strudels?

03:35.280 --> 03:36.000
Oh man.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.160
If someone ate my last strudel, I would be pretty, pretty PO.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.480
What if they ate the icing, but left the strudel?

03:43.040 --> 03:44.320
What am I supposed to do with this?

03:46.320 --> 03:48.480
What am I supposed to do with this fruit plank?

03:48.480 --> 03:49.200
Get it out of here.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.320
I can't get this plank in the garbage disposal.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.400
Deborah, go clean up the garbage disposal for once.

03:57.120 --> 04:01.200
I think, what do they say about like alcoholism and it's like, it's not alcoholism unless

04:01.200 --> 04:02.400
you're secretly doing it.

04:03.040 --> 04:08.240
I think once you get, reach a point in your life where you're secretly jammed, like very,

04:08.240 --> 04:14.480
very, uh, discreetly slam jam in Hot Pockets, like you've reached a point where you need

04:14.480 --> 04:15.280
help, I think.

04:15.920 --> 04:16.960
Yeah, that's a good point.

04:16.960 --> 04:24.400
The first step in admitting you have Hot Pocket abuse is admitting you have Hot Pocket abuse.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.920
It's really the only step too.

04:25.920 --> 04:29.520
Wait, are you saying they should, they should do this in public?

04:29.520 --> 04:32.720
Like just wait till your roommate's in the living room and then just loudly-

04:32.720 --> 04:34.160
How is your roommate going to learn?

04:34.160 --> 04:37.600
Because your roommate's not going to learn anything if you just slam jam while they're

04:37.600 --> 04:38.480
not there and also-

04:38.480 --> 04:39.920
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.000
I'm slam jamming your Hot Pockets.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.480
Yeah, he's like, um, Martin, uh, I asked you to carry the trash out and you didn't.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.080
So now watch me eat this.

04:51.520 --> 04:52.720
This was yours.

04:52.720 --> 04:53.760
You need to feel it.

04:53.760 --> 04:54.480
Don't blame me.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.600
I have a disease.

04:56.160 --> 04:56.960
I have a disease.

04:56.960 --> 04:57.920
It's Hot Pockets.

04:58.640 --> 04:59.680
They are delicious though.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.560
Who can-

05:00.560 --> 05:02.320
Is there a flavor dependency here?

05:02.320 --> 05:04.640
Like is it, are there some flavors that's acceptable?

05:04.640 --> 05:10.800
Like for me, if you got meatballs and mozzarella, it might as well, it might as well be stolen

05:10.800 --> 05:11.600
already.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.560
I recently moved cross country from Michigan to Texas.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.840
I left my friends and family and go live with a person I've never met.

05:18.720 --> 05:22.720
Which brings me to my question, which I feel only you brothers can answer.

05:22.720 --> 05:28.240
When telling you where I'm from at the end of the email, do I tell you where I currently

05:28.240 --> 05:30.160
am or where I'm originally from?

05:30.720 --> 05:32.000
Thanks, Jim from-

05:32.000 --> 05:35.520
Oh God, I don't know yet.

05:35.520 --> 05:40.400
Um, I think when we ask people to do that, to, to name their locale at the end of the

05:40.400 --> 05:42.880
question, it's, it's mainly for like a census.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.000
It's, it's mainly so we get a good idea-

05:46.000 --> 05:47.440
Not for tracking purposes.

05:48.080 --> 05:52.800
No, we're not going to hunt you down, but I, we would like to know the, the cultural

05:52.800 --> 05:57.360
smattering of this great country or world of ours because we're international.

05:57.360 --> 05:57.600
Right.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.640
Internationally known.

05:58.640 --> 06:02.960
This is a good question though, because someone was telling me a story the other day that

06:02.960 --> 06:07.360
they worked with this person who said that they were from Long Island, New York.

06:08.320 --> 06:13.440
And they had lived there to the age of two and then moved somewhere else.

06:13.440 --> 06:13.920
Bad news.

06:14.720 --> 06:15.840
You were not.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.640
It's not where, where were you conceived?

06:18.640 --> 06:19.520
Like that's not it.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.760
No, that's not it whatsoever.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.040
That's not even close to it.

06:23.040 --> 06:28.240
I think that the most important thing is which one sounds funnier with whatever the

06:28.240 --> 06:31.280
problem is that you have.

06:31.280 --> 06:39.600
Like if you, if you're originally from some place that rhymes with my roommate smells

06:39.600 --> 06:44.640
bad and your question is about how your roommate smells, then I think you go with that one.

06:44.640 --> 06:48.880
I think it's all about, it's all about alliteration is the number one issue here.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.520
I think he's the bigger question.

06:51.520 --> 06:56.160
The bigger issue here is where do you say you are from in general?

06:56.160 --> 06:59.120
Well, in general, just like in life and stuff.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.840
I grew up in West Virginia.

07:01.840 --> 07:05.040
I went to school in Oklahoma and now I live in Cincinnati.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.160
Where the hell am I from?

07:06.720 --> 07:07.920
Well, you're West Virginia.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.200
You're a citizen of the world.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.480
I'm in Cincinnati now.

07:10.480 --> 07:14.960
So like I'm, I might be from West Virginia, but when I meet people outside of Cincinnati

07:14.960 --> 07:17.360
and they ask where I'm from, do I still say West Virginia?

07:17.360 --> 07:21.360
Travis, when I go to King's Island and people ask where I'm from, I'll say King's Island.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.000
I'm here now.

07:22.640 --> 07:23.440
Look at me.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.240
Well, if you lived at King's Island though, wouldn't you?

07:26.240 --> 07:30.160
Like if you took up residence in King's Island, if you lived in the Tomb Raider ride.

07:30.160 --> 07:33.280
If you guys had, yeah, I was, God damn, Travis, you're in my mind.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.560
I was about to ask which ride you guys wanted to be on so I could say Tomb Raider.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.160
Cause it's obviously the best one to build a residence.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.520
Tomb Raider's gone.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.480
Is it really?

07:40.480 --> 07:40.720
Yeah.

07:40.720 --> 07:44.080
They no longer have the affiliation with Paramount.

07:44.080 --> 07:46.000
They gutted it, but it's still a ride.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.080
It's just like the most boring ride.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.160
Swing chairs, the ride, the adventure.

07:50.160 --> 07:55.200
I think that whatever place you lived in the longest is your, is your, where you're from.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.800
I hate, I fucking hate it when people are like, yeah, I just got back from Jamaica.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.520
Uh, I'm Jamaican now.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.680
It's like, I'm pretty sure you can't just do that.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.840
I'm pretty sure no one does that.

08:05.840 --> 08:06.800
I don't think that happens.

08:06.800 --> 08:10.560
I know nine or 10 people who came back with dreads and steel drums and they're like, this

08:10.560 --> 08:11.360
is who I am now.

08:11.360 --> 08:11.760
Love it.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.560
They're like, listen to the sound, feel the sound of the steel drum.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.280
Feel this rhythm.

08:15.280 --> 08:19.280
I'm from Jamaica. I can feel it. You can listen to this rhythm, but I don't think you can

08:19.280 --> 08:20.160
hear this rhythm.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.280
Does that make sense?

08:21.280 --> 08:23.600
Cause you're not from, from the islands.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.360
Hey, hey, it's a Jamaica thing.

08:26.800 --> 08:31.280
If you're not from, if you're not from sunny high maker, just get out of here.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.960
You wouldn't get it bald head.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.000
You don't understand.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.560
Uh, Hey, listen, I, I, uh, I want to hear a Yahoo answer from Griffin.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.120
Oh, okay.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.000
I'm from Jamaica.

08:42.000 --> 08:42.800
I'm from Jamaica.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.360
I'm from Griffin. Oh, okay.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.320
Let me do that for you.

08:46.320 --> 08:52.320
We, uh, we have access, uh, we pay a subscription fee to the Yahoo answer service.

08:52.320 --> 08:53.360
It's pricey.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.920
It is rich, but you're, it's worth it.

08:55.920 --> 09:01.920
So we can find a random strangers questions there and try to, uh, help them make fun of

09:01.920 --> 09:05.280
them and help them, help them, help them.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.520
Um, let's help this person.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.600
This one was sent in by Gali Ayali.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.200
Thank you, Gali Ayali.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.200
It's by Yahoo answers user oxymoron.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.400
I like a nice lemongrass.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.200
Gali Ayali.

09:15.200 --> 09:15.840
You ever have that?

09:16.960 --> 09:18.480
It's my very favorite.

09:18.480 --> 09:26.400
Uh, oxymoron asks, would it be disrespectful to bring birthday cake to someone's funeral?

09:29.840 --> 09:33.920
Well, gosh, like only in the way that that's exactly not the thing.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.040
Are there additional details where it just happens to work out that

09:37.040 --> 09:39.920
it's a funeral for someone who's also it's their birthday?

09:39.920 --> 09:40.480
Okay.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.040
No, but that's like the saddest thing I've ever heard.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.160
That is really depressing.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.280
Blow these candles out.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.480
You can't, no breath.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.160
Push his, push his tongue.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.600
Maybe there's one more breath in there.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.720
We could use the last one.

09:52.720 --> 09:53.440
Make a wish.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.200
I bet I know what you're going to wish for.

09:58.720 --> 09:59.760
There's no gift.

09:59.760 --> 10:04.160
You can get somebody who's dead that isn't insensitive unless it's like, unless it's

10:04.160 --> 10:05.920
an extra pillow, a pillow.

10:05.920 --> 10:06.160
Yeah.

10:06.160 --> 10:06.880
That's about it.

10:06.880 --> 10:14.560
Um, sunglasses, a weekend at Bernie's.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.800
Thank you, Travis.

10:16.800 --> 10:25.360
I don't, I mean, but think about it this way.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.720
Those people at that funeral, they're so sad.

10:29.840 --> 10:30.640
They're so sad.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.440
And what, what makes you happier than anything in the world?

10:33.440 --> 10:37.520
Then when somebody is like, Hey, there's cake.

10:37.520 --> 10:41.360
The question is where you put it at a funeral.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.640
Cause you got the line, right?

10:42.640 --> 10:44.000
Going to the coffin, obviously.

10:44.560 --> 10:44.960
I don't know.

10:44.960 --> 10:48.160
It might be kind of a jam to put it at like the foot of the coffin, like resting on the

10:48.160 --> 10:48.400
top.

10:48.400 --> 10:54.240
Cause I'm like, they say their tearful goodbyes, uh, but then like there's cake like instantly

10:54.240 --> 10:55.360
afterwards.

10:55.360 --> 10:55.600
Yeah.

10:55.600 --> 10:59.280
And you can't let it, uh, you can't put it on the other side of the room because people

10:59.280 --> 11:03.040
spend the whole day, like come up with excuses to not be near the casket.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.480
The way, Oh gosh, that cake.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.240
I got to just get over there.

11:06.800 --> 11:13.040
Whatever you do, just be really, um, delicate and sensitive in the decorating of the cake.

11:13.040 --> 11:13.280
Yeah.

11:14.720 --> 11:15.040
You might.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.320
So what do you, what do you think?

11:16.320 --> 11:17.920
Race car, obviously.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.600
Cause it's a race car is fine.

11:20.160 --> 11:23.280
Um, I would avoid a zombie themed cake.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.560
No zombie themed cake.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.560
A dragon is good.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.640
Maybe like a Phoenix would be appropriate.

11:28.640 --> 11:29.360
Oh yeah.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.080
Sort of emerging, especially if they're being cremated.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.000
Who boy, that would really get them.

11:35.680 --> 11:37.280
You probably shouldn't write on the cake.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.400
You're not one year older.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.120
You're one year closer to death because they already done.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.640
They already done hit that.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.560
They are actually one year further from death.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.800
Like they're getting actually further from it.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.400
Negative one year.

11:49.040 --> 11:49.200
Yeah.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.920
This is my negative first birthday.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.080
It's, it's pretty cool.

11:54.720 --> 12:00.240
I can't wait till my negative 16th birthday so I can buy smokes and porn in the, in the

12:00.240 --> 12:01.840
afterlife and afterlife.

12:01.840 --> 12:02.400
Yeah.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.360
Afterlife smokes.

12:03.360 --> 12:04.640
Hey, I got a question for you.

12:04.640 --> 12:08.320
How do I incorporate a quirk into my personality?

12:08.320 --> 12:13.840
I work at an advertising agency, a naturally quirky environment, but I don't know how to

12:13.840 --> 12:16.240
start acting thing, start acting quirky.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.600
What if I wanted to be the guy who works barefoot?

12:19.600 --> 12:22.880
What if I wanted to be the guy who exclusively started wearing neon t-shirts?

12:23.520 --> 12:27.600
I feel like certain people can get away with these things and certain people can't.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.840
How do I become one who can Nathan?

12:29.840 --> 12:31.920
Nathan, I have a suggestion.

12:31.920 --> 12:34.960
Maybe your quirk should be the guy who never says quirk.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.720
Can you do that for me as like a step one?

12:39.440 --> 12:40.320
You got it.

12:40.320 --> 12:44.720
The, the thing is with so many things in life, the answer is one word and that's commitment.

12:45.360 --> 12:52.480
You gotta, if you're not going to wear shoes at work, if it gets cold in the office, you

12:52.480 --> 12:54.000
gotta still, you're still no shoes.

12:54.000 --> 12:54.960
Nathan got me.

12:54.960 --> 12:55.440
No shoes.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.960
Nathan can't pack up on that.

12:56.960 --> 13:00.720
And you got, if you wear neon t-shirts, you're neon Nathan that don't change.

13:00.720 --> 13:01.760
You've got to commit.

13:02.320 --> 13:06.320
Neon Nathan is good because then if you become like a professional athlete, then that name

13:06.320 --> 13:07.600
will carry over quite well.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.080
I imagine.

13:08.880 --> 13:13.120
Yeah, I, I would like to give some advice to everybody who's looking to pick up a quirk

13:13.120 --> 13:17.120
and all those kids who want to define their personality by coming up with something.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.960
If you want to decide if you're the type of person who can think about if you're the type

13:20.960 --> 13:25.200
of person who does, and if you don't already do it, don't start doing it.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.720
If you are a person who already does a weird thing, keep up with it.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.240
Don't pick up a quirk.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.560
Violating the premise of the question.

13:32.560 --> 13:33.600
I understand that.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.720
It's just like the most frustrating that I'm going to be the dude who only drinks Boons

13:36.720 --> 13:37.680
farm.

13:37.680 --> 13:42.480
I'm going to be the guy that plays, you know, a double neck mandolin.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.920
Don't do it.

13:43.920 --> 13:48.000
I do think that if you're going to pick a quirk, you should pick something that's useful.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.800
Like be the guy who his quirk is.

13:50.800 --> 13:51.920
He knows how to pick locks.

13:51.920 --> 13:56.160
Like then you go from like quirk to talent or like special skill.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.520
You know, I think everybody on the planet should pick locks.

13:59.520 --> 14:00.960
I think everybody should possess that knowledge.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.320
I don't think that's quirky.

14:02.320 --> 14:06.320
I think if you don't believe in boundaries, if Nathan wore a candy necklace every day,

14:06.320 --> 14:07.120
think about that.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.600
There's Nathan with his candy necklace.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.160
That helps you because you get that sugar boost throughout the day.

14:12.160 --> 14:15.200
If somebody else wants to come and nibble on you, they can do that.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.640
What if Nathan was the guy with a prehensile tail?

14:18.640 --> 14:21.440
Okay.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.800
Don't know how you get that.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.240
That's a little late.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.240
It's an outpatient surgery these days.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.680
Like you're in your out tail.

14:28.560 --> 14:32.480
I think that no matter what, people are very perceptive.

14:32.480 --> 14:36.880
If you try to pick up a quirk like this, people are going to know what you're doing.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.520
And for like the first month that you do it, they're going to judge you silently.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.320
They'd be like, Nathan has a cane now?

14:44.320 --> 14:45.600
That's, that's weird.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.720
And after that, you're going to, you're going to break through it.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.000
And people will be like, oh, this is Nathan.

14:50.000 --> 14:50.960
He just, he has a cane.

14:51.520 --> 14:52.560
He doesn't have a limp or anything.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.520
He just carries a cane around.

14:54.640 --> 14:58.720
The thing is, it won't be cool until everyone who currently works there has quit and been

14:58.720 --> 15:00.240
replaced with someone else.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.080
That's when, that's when it will know.

15:02.080 --> 15:05.760
It will be like a, a worthwhile, valid thing to do right now.

15:05.760 --> 15:08.720
It's tough sale, tough sale.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.400
Don't do it, Nathan.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.600
You're a beautiful flower.

15:11.600 --> 15:12.640
Nathan, you're better than that.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.520
How about your, your quirk is you're the guy who can't stop talking about

15:15.520 --> 15:16.640
my brother, my brother and me.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.680
And if I show for the modern era, it never stops.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.400
It's always extolling the virtues of podcasts.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.680
I should give it a listen.

15:23.680 --> 15:24.400
Maybe you should.

15:25.600 --> 15:31.200
Hey, I've been wondering if I should start wearing cologne when I go out or dress up

15:31.840 --> 15:36.000
any recommendation on what I should start at, what I should look for to start smelling

15:36.000 --> 15:39.680
like a classy dude sense and sensibility.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.920
And that name was created by Travis.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.680
You can't do that anymore.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.520
That's, that's perjury.

15:45.520 --> 15:46.160
I like it.

15:48.080 --> 15:48.880
I like it.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.080
What do you felonious?

15:50.720 --> 15:52.640
What do you guys wear me?

15:53.280 --> 15:53.520
Yeah.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.560
What's your smell?

15:54.560 --> 15:55.520
I'm Oh, natural.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.600
I used to do that.

15:57.600 --> 16:02.400
I used to do acts, but that, that made me smell like the inside of an air conditioner

16:02.400 --> 16:03.040
after a while.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.240
So I stopped.

16:04.240 --> 16:08.080
Well, what I imagined the inside of an air conditioner is smelling like rusty.

16:08.080 --> 16:11.280
It made me smell rusty and I hated it kind of rusty.

16:11.280 --> 16:17.280
Yeah, now I just slap on deodorant and I, I use Irish spring soap and keeps me fresh

16:17.280 --> 16:17.600
all day.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.200
I love it.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.480
I don't like to overpower people.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.920
I fly under the radar.

16:21.920 --> 16:29.360
I go with a, an old spice trifecta of old spice, body wash deodorant and little bit

16:29.360 --> 16:30.640
of old spice cologne.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.960
And then, and then a dash of actual old spices.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.600
Like, oh, this, this coriander is ancient.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.640
Let me get it on my skin.

16:39.920 --> 16:40.720
That's good.

16:40.720 --> 16:41.840
Oh, that's really nice.

16:41.840 --> 16:46.400
Uh, I wear, um, uh, Burberry.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.960
I think, I think Burberry, they make like bags, right?

16:50.960 --> 16:51.760
Burberry.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.480
Sure.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.200
Bags.

16:53.200 --> 16:53.680
Yeah.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.160
Yeah.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.440
So like I wear Burberry.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.480
I think it's called Burberry.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.920
The fragrance or smell like Burberry.

16:59.920 --> 17:04.720
Do you smear that right on your cummerbund or do you like a little ring around your monocle

17:04.720 --> 17:05.520
or how does it work?

17:05.520 --> 17:05.840
Can you explain that?

17:05.840 --> 17:06.560
I have to.

17:06.560 --> 17:06.960
Yeah, sure.

17:06.960 --> 17:11.760
I have to, um, uh, first I soak it, soak my ascot in it overnight.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.200
Ladies love that shit.

17:13.200 --> 17:13.760
Yeah.

17:13.760 --> 17:17.680
And then I, I take the deed to the boathouse and I soak it in that and I keep that in my

17:17.680 --> 17:18.800
pocket as sort of like a.

17:19.440 --> 17:20.320
What's that smell?

17:20.320 --> 17:22.240
Um, let me check my pockets.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.920
Oh, it's this boathouse that I have.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.440
Here's the deed to the boathouse.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.360
It smells like Burberry right now.

17:27.360 --> 17:34.720
Uh, just make sure when you, when you apply it, uh, the rule is that, uh, your, uh, cologne

17:34.720 --> 17:38.800
should only be powerful enough to be smelled in the embrace of a lover.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.280
So you're saying what's the perimeter?

17:44.320 --> 17:45.600
That is a good rule.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.160
It just makes me sick when you put it like that.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.080
I know I two sprays.

17:50.080 --> 17:54.000
The point was, I thought the point was to get the embrace with the smell.

17:54.000 --> 17:54.880
Like the people get.

17:54.880 --> 18:01.200
If your, if your stink is attracting people from across the room, a attracting people

18:01.200 --> 18:03.040
like I got to go embrace somebody right now.

18:03.040 --> 18:07.840
What you've never like, you've never like hunted a smell down like, Oh fuck, what's

18:07.840 --> 18:08.400
that smell?

18:08.400 --> 18:09.200
Got to get to it.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.000
And then you find it.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.320
And at the end there's a, there's a beautiful lady or a beautiful man or like a beautiful

18:14.320 --> 18:15.040
dog or something.

18:15.040 --> 18:19.200
Like it's something I'm saying your smell influence shouldn't reach that far across

18:19.200 --> 18:19.920
the room.

18:19.920 --> 18:20.160
Yeah.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.280
That's your, your reach.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.800
Your throw is too big.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.200
You're going to affect the taste of people's food.

18:25.200 --> 18:28.160
Like in other rooms, it's not a good way to go.

18:28.880 --> 18:29.120
Yeah.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.520
And don't forget bloodhounds.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.120
You don't want to throw them off.

18:33.120 --> 18:34.160
It's just, it's cruel.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.360
They're trying to solve crimes.

18:36.320 --> 18:39.440
I don't, I, I, I just don't know what smells good anymore.

18:39.440 --> 18:39.920
You guys.

18:40.480 --> 18:44.800
Well, I, as to what, how to pick a fragrance, we gave you some fragrance tools.

18:44.800 --> 18:49.360
Just go to your local department store and they, and it's fun, man.

18:49.360 --> 18:53.760
Just go and start smelling, say, Hey, this is the kind of fragrances I'm into.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.400
Well, you probably won't know that, but maybe some notes that you'd like.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.920
I'd like something with some notes of old leather and sandalwood.

18:59.920 --> 19:00.720
Can you hook me up?

19:00.720 --> 19:02.240
And they will, that sounds delightful.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.000
They will generate a smell for you.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.320
I would like to smell like an old book.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.360
Can I have that?

19:07.360 --> 19:08.320
I bet you they do.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.080
Make sure you say that has to exist.

19:10.080 --> 19:10.480
Right.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.760
Notes of whiskey.

19:11.760 --> 19:14.640
That's always good with campfire.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.120
I want to smell like an old hobo.

19:17.120 --> 19:20.160
Can I smell like an old hobo with campfire whiskey?

19:20.160 --> 19:21.920
Do you guys have midnight hobo in?

19:25.040 --> 19:25.920
Oh, that's right.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.800
I was trying to drink my chai tea and you just got me right, right there.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.720
Oh, so nice.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.480
Hey, this is nice.

19:32.480 --> 19:37.680
But are you guys, you guys want to do some, some eco-tourism and take a journey with me

19:38.400 --> 19:39.360
for Earth Hour?

19:39.360 --> 19:40.640
Turn those lights off and come with us.

19:40.640 --> 19:59.040
Turn those lights off and come with us on the journey to the money zone.

20:06.560 --> 20:10.080
In the driver's seat is our listener, Ryan Shrout.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.360
What are we driving?

20:11.360 --> 20:15.680
We're driving a car, an eco-car called Very Small.

20:15.680 --> 20:16.240
Yeah.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.440
And it's taking us to a place called PC Perspective.

20:19.440 --> 20:20.560
That's Ryan's company.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.840
Now Griffin, tell me about it.

20:21.840 --> 20:22.640
Hit me with it.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.160
What is PC Perspective?

20:24.160 --> 20:25.600
Listen, the world of PC.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.000
It's very confusing.

20:28.000 --> 20:28.720
Can you?

20:28.720 --> 20:31.360
I need you to explain what PC stands for.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.080
I got a pussy control.

20:38.720 --> 20:39.520
What's up, Ryan?

20:39.520 --> 20:40.640
Your business rules now.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.440
Go ahead.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.720
Hey, Ryan, you can use that.

20:43.280 --> 20:47.280
He never explicitly says, I'm going to imagine it stands for personal computer,

20:48.480 --> 20:50.480
which we all have.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.920
Or pussy computer.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.200
Or a pussy computer.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.080
I need more RAM.

20:54.080 --> 20:54.800
I bet you do.

21:00.480 --> 21:03.200
Anyway, personal computers are confusing.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.240
Who knows what's going on in there?

21:04.240 --> 21:05.040
I don't.

21:05.040 --> 21:08.320
Did our wizards activating diodes?

21:08.320 --> 21:09.040
Who knows?

21:09.040 --> 21:11.200
Nobody does, except for PC Perspective.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.480
It's a great spot.

21:12.480 --> 21:17.920
If you need info on PCs, if you need in-depth reviews on PC components,

21:17.920 --> 21:19.520
I didn't know there were components in there.

21:19.520 --> 21:20.400
But apparently there are.

21:20.400 --> 21:23.600
And apparently they have varying degrees of quality.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.960
And that is something that PC Perspective can elucidate for you.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.800
I'm thinking about building a new computer, Griffin.

21:30.800 --> 21:31.920
Do they have anything for me?

21:31.920 --> 21:34.320
Or should I just go screw off?

21:34.320 --> 21:35.680
No, they'll help you right there.

21:35.680 --> 21:42.320
If you want to toss together a fat rig to use the parlance of the hacker community,

21:43.200 --> 21:47.520
if you want to access cyberspace on the baddest rig around, then-

21:47.520 --> 21:52.160
If you want a real information superhighway hot rod.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.840
Vroom, vroom.

21:53.840 --> 21:57.600
You pull into the hardware leaderboard, which is the thing that they have on PC Perspective.

21:57.600 --> 21:58.400
Where is that?

21:58.400 --> 22:01.600
PCPer.com first slash HWLB.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.240
It's right there.

22:02.240 --> 22:06.000
Which is shorthand for all those things we just said.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.920
And it'll give you recommendations for building your PC.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.640
Which I actually built a PC one time.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.880
And I just bought a bunch of shit off Newegg.

22:14.880 --> 22:18.000
I was like, oh, I need a RAM.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.520
Let me just slap that on there.

22:19.520 --> 22:20.800
I need six diodes.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.160
And the computer blew up, took one of my legs.

22:24.160 --> 22:28.000
So it can be avoided.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.800
They got forums where you can chat it up with other people who are searching for perspective.

22:34.800 --> 22:40.880
And they talk about PC gaming, which I'm sure a lot of our audience is into.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.440
I didn't know you could game on this other than Jezzball.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.040
I'm pretty into Jezzball right now.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.040
PCPer.com first slash podcast.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.080
They have a show.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.520
It's probably better than ours.

22:51.520 --> 22:53.600
At least we'll teach you more about computers.

22:53.600 --> 22:58.160
We literally know, I know nothing about these things that I do my work on every day.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.840
I'm on a computer nine hours a day.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.000
No fucking clue what's going on in there.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.840
That's PCPer.com.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.240
PCPer.com.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.640
And they got reviews, community, podcasts.

23:08.640 --> 23:09.600
Check it all out.

23:10.240 --> 23:17.440
And while you're going, you can make sure to hum this jingle that Griffin has crafted.

23:17.440 --> 23:18.480
Gotta be honest with you.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.880
I tried to do some pre-pro on this one earlier because I was nervous.

23:22.880 --> 23:28.640
And I could not, for the life of me, turn PC Perspective into a song.

23:28.640 --> 23:29.440
So let's see.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.280
Let's see how it goes.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.080
It's lively hot.

23:35.520 --> 23:36.960
I got the chord progression down.

23:36.960 --> 23:43.760
But gotta get those parts.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.600
Gotta snatch that RAM up.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.480
Gotta snatch that RAM up.

23:52.480 --> 23:59.600
Gotta get a cooler chassis for my big fat rig.

24:02.880 --> 24:09.680
Gotta be a cyberspace wizard on PC Perspective.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.120
That's not the URL.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.560
I'm gonna take another stab at it.

24:16.560 --> 24:16.960
Nope.

24:16.960 --> 24:23.040
Don't clap for that.

24:23.040 --> 24:23.600
Oh, good.

24:24.880 --> 24:25.760
Remix.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.680
What I thought was, I wanna hear that again.

24:31.200 --> 24:31.920
Hey, dad.

24:32.560 --> 24:33.360
Whoa.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.400
That took a weird turn.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.120
What's wrong with your rig?

24:40.000 --> 24:44.400
I think that it needs more RAM and bits and bytes.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.720
What else do you dig?

24:50.160 --> 24:53.760
Let's get together on something for once.

24:54.960 --> 24:55.760
PCPer.com.

24:58.480 --> 24:58.800
There.

25:01.520 --> 25:02.080
You nailed it.

25:03.280 --> 25:06.000
That one had overtones of family in it.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.040
It's been strife.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.160
There was some strife there.

25:08.160 --> 25:12.000
It's like, dad, I love you, but we just can't get together on it.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.880
Let's unite on this one thing.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.240
Let's talk about PCs.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.400
I should have just sung Pussy Control.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.400
I really missed my opportunity there.

25:22.400 --> 25:25.200
Can I look up the tabulature to Pussy Control really quick?

25:25.200 --> 25:30.400
Yeah, maybe if PC Per takes us to the money zone again, which they most certainly will,

25:32.480 --> 25:35.680
we'll do a riff on a spoof.

25:35.680 --> 25:37.680
A hot spoof on Pussy Control.

25:37.680 --> 25:38.880
A spoof on Pussy Control.

25:38.880 --> 25:45.680
I live by myself, and like Griffin, I've been on a Lady Siesta internet fist bump.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.640
Sometimes, after a long day at work, I like to-

25:48.640 --> 25:50.480
I actually just fist bumped my monitor.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.880
Like, why did I do that?

25:52.880 --> 25:54.960
I'm alone in a room.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.600
Sometimes, after a long day at work, I like to have a beer.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.360
A beer?

25:59.360 --> 25:59.760
Come on.

26:00.400 --> 26:05.600
I go to my favorite bar after work once a week, occasionally more than once,

26:05.600 --> 26:08.640
if I've had a particularly bad day or rough bus commute.

26:08.640 --> 26:10.800
Very rarely do I drink enough to be drunk.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.480
At most, I leave a bit tipsy.

26:13.040 --> 26:18.640
I always tip well and never leave my glass sitting at a table for someone else to clean up.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.560
My question is this.

26:21.680 --> 26:22.720
Is it okay to do this?

26:23.600 --> 26:26.400
Should I feel ashamed for bevving out by myself?

26:27.200 --> 26:30.400
That's from single dark beer.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.520
Absolutely not.

26:31.520 --> 26:32.320
Absolutely not.

26:32.320 --> 26:33.280
It's totally cool.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.120
It's totally fucking cool.

26:35.120 --> 26:42.400
Like, you're not getting sloshed and, like, I don't know, hitting on your neighbor.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.800
You're just having a- you're having a relaxer.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.080
Just relaxing.

26:46.080 --> 26:46.240
Yeah.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.480
Alcoholism is just a label that society puts on you.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.040
I don't subscribe to labels.

26:53.040 --> 26:56.320
You've already- you've already eschewed their expectations for you

26:56.320 --> 26:59.840
in terms of pursuing and securing a life mate.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.600
Why not just shrug this one off too?

27:01.600 --> 27:03.680
You're living the life you want like a herpes ad.

27:03.680 --> 27:04.240
Just do it.

27:04.240 --> 27:08.080
Just drink it up and you're not going to meet anybody nice in your house.

27:08.800 --> 27:09.440
I'm just saying.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.760
I mean, I know, like, you're taking a break right now, but-

27:11.760 --> 27:13.680
That's why he goes out once a week.

27:13.680 --> 27:14.400
I do the same thing.

27:14.400 --> 27:18.000
It's like, maybe tonight, maybe tonight, I'll find that special somebody.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.240
I'll have one beer and I'll clean up after myself.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.000
He's helping someone notice that part.

27:24.000 --> 27:24.800
They will see that.

27:24.800 --> 27:28.240
Ladies will see that from across the bar like, did he just bust his own table?

27:28.800 --> 27:30.320
Get over here.

27:30.320 --> 27:31.200
Get over here.

27:31.200 --> 27:34.880
I'm just- make sure you bring your own rag and your own coaster.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.360
And really just take care of business.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.120
I brought these pretzels myself.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.200
You can just get me a little bowl or something.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.800
I need a bowl for my rolled gold.

27:43.920 --> 27:44.420
Listen.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.240
I've got a paring knife.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.880
If you could just give me the lemon, I'll just sort of carve it myself.

27:49.680 --> 27:50.880
Keep on living.

27:50.880 --> 27:51.380
Okay.

27:52.400 --> 27:55.120
This is what Matthew McConaughey says and he likes to party.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.440
I think- just don't party as hard as Matthew McConaughey.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.520
That's my barometer.

28:01.520 --> 28:02.880
And nobody should party that hard.

28:02.880 --> 28:03.920
I don't think you can handle it.

28:05.520 --> 28:09.360
I've had to reskin my bongos three times trying to live as hard as Matthew McConaughey.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.040
Have you been- do you oil them?

28:11.040 --> 28:11.680
What?

28:11.680 --> 28:12.080
Yeah.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.360
You know, I was oiling them.

28:13.360 --> 28:19.280
I was using that- I was using that sandalwood oil for the longest time and it did help.

28:19.280 --> 28:19.760
You're right.

28:19.760 --> 28:20.720
It helped with the tone.

28:22.960 --> 28:24.800
I'd say it brought it up a good half step.

28:24.800 --> 28:29.200
But the problem is afterwards, there was a lot of residue.

28:29.200 --> 28:34.480
Yeah, it's hard because once your hands get slippery, it's hard to break out a good paradiddle

28:34.480 --> 28:36.560
once your hands get that slippery.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.440
I would always get as far as like- I was getting like, does the goosh.

28:39.440 --> 28:43.200
And when I would get to the goosh, like, my hand would stick for just that fraction of a second.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.160
I noticed.

28:44.160 --> 28:48.640
Like, in my earlier bongo years, I probably wouldn't have, but I need that responsiveness.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.000
I mean, what model are you working with now?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.760
Is it a Rickenbacker?

28:53.760 --> 28:57.440
No, it's a bongotron 3000.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.520
It's pretty big in Europe.

29:03.520 --> 29:06.080
I'm kind of surprised you haven't heard of it.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.200
I think that that was a game that you and I just played and I think I lost.

29:10.240 --> 29:13.440
I think we just played bongo conversational as chicken.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.800
We all lost, I think.

29:14.800 --> 29:18.560
In case anyone was wondering, bongotron was my favorite transformer.

29:18.560 --> 29:22.480
He didn't do much, but when he did, it was mellow.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.960
He transformed from a robot into bullshit.

29:26.240 --> 29:27.520
Hey, do you want a yahoo?

29:27.520 --> 29:28.480
Yeah, redeem yourself.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.600
This one was sent in by Andrew Binder.

29:31.600 --> 29:32.400
Thank you, Andrew.

29:32.400 --> 29:35.200
It's by yahoo answers user LOL, who asks,

29:37.200 --> 29:42.960
is it normal to be sexually attracted to- anybody want to guess?

29:42.960 --> 29:44.960
I want to guess my answer, no.

29:44.960 --> 29:48.160
I want to guess my answer, no.

29:48.160 --> 29:48.720
Numbers.

29:49.440 --> 29:50.240
Numbers.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.800
Is it okay to be sexually attracted to numbers?

29:53.440 --> 29:55.200
He adds, I admit I am gay.

29:55.760 --> 30:01.680
Well, okay, but there are some nights where I take the algebra book back into my room

30:01.680 --> 30:03.040
and jack off to the numbers.

30:04.640 --> 30:07.680
Number three is my favorite because it's so sexy.

30:09.040 --> 30:13.120
Well, yeah, it looks like a sideways, but yeah, it makes sense.

30:13.120 --> 30:16.160
It adds up or maybe ups like sideways balls.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.960
There's a lot of things that that three could be and sideways boobs.

30:18.960 --> 30:20.080
It's not okay.

30:20.080 --> 30:20.960
Three is pretty hot.

30:22.240 --> 30:23.680
Let's break this question down.

30:23.680 --> 30:27.760
The first, my biggest problem with it is that he says, I admit that I am gay

30:27.760 --> 30:33.040
as if that has any bearing on the situation whatsoever.

30:33.680 --> 30:36.240
If you're straight in the numbers, then that's cool.

30:36.240 --> 30:36.960
Yeah.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.920
Or like, is he saying that that's like a side effect?

30:39.920 --> 30:44.400
It's like one out of every 100 people who like people of their same gender

30:44.400 --> 30:46.160
also would like to fuck a number.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.120
What's the sexiest number, everybody?

30:49.680 --> 30:52.640
See this, listen, we're not ready to have that conversation yet.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.920
We'll get to that, but I think we need to come up with some rules.

30:55.920 --> 31:00.080
First, are we talking about fucking the idea of a number?

31:00.080 --> 31:04.400
Are we talking about, I have the important thing is not to fuck anything under 16.

31:04.400 --> 31:10.480
Well, we're not going to think of anything funnier than that.

31:10.480 --> 31:16.000
God, are we, are we, but I mean, are we talking about like fucking an actual,

31:16.000 --> 31:20.160
like if we could manifest this number into, I think you have to pick which shape would

31:20.160 --> 31:25.520
be like the most pleasurable to like rub up against a numeral, a numeral or cause like,

31:25.520 --> 31:27.280
there's so many combinations beyond that.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.880
I'm saying what is the hottest numeral.

31:28.880 --> 31:35.920
Well, we have to set a limit because I could just say like 16,783,492.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.280
And then that's a fucking orgy.

31:37.280 --> 31:40.640
Once you get that number, let's say between zero and a hundred.

31:41.280 --> 31:45.920
No numeral, a numeral between one, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine.

31:45.920 --> 31:47.360
Oh, I see what you're saying.

31:47.360 --> 31:47.600
Yes.

31:48.160 --> 31:48.800
It's zero.

31:49.440 --> 31:49.680
Nope.

31:50.320 --> 31:50.880
Nope.

31:50.880 --> 31:51.360
You're wrong.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.560
Zero is mysterious.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.080
Travis, you're a fool.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.280
Justin, do you want to guess?

31:55.280 --> 31:58.000
Well, zero is, zero is not bad.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.080
I think seven is the sexiest number.

32:00.080 --> 32:00.400
Travis.

32:00.400 --> 32:00.800
What is it?

32:00.800 --> 32:01.360
Second guess.

32:02.080 --> 32:02.320
Eight.

32:03.040 --> 32:03.840
Yup.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.360
What's up two holes.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.080
How did you get there?

32:06.080 --> 32:06.640
Two holes.

32:08.640 --> 32:09.520
Which one tonight?

32:09.520 --> 32:10.560
You know, he's down.

32:10.560 --> 32:11.520
Do you want the top?

32:11.520 --> 32:17.040
You want that solid, that solid hefty bottom, or do you want the narrow, the slightly narrower

32:17.040 --> 32:17.280
top?

32:17.920 --> 32:18.240
Sounds good.

32:18.240 --> 32:23.440
And also it recalls, it recalls snowmen, which we can all agree.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.440
Always hot.

32:25.440 --> 32:28.560
I shouldn't impress my, my feelings on people.

32:28.560 --> 32:32.640
Here's if I were to defend eight, I were to say it's obviously not three.

32:33.280 --> 32:33.920
Right.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.400
Because the three is just half an eight.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.560
You cut it sideways right down the front already.

32:38.560 --> 32:39.120
Sure.

32:39.120 --> 32:42.320
Why have a, why have, you could have two threes already.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.120
It's called an eight.

32:43.120 --> 32:43.920
A number one.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.080
How are you supposed to fuck that?

32:46.080 --> 32:46.400
Really?

32:46.960 --> 32:47.200
Yeah.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.560
Zero.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.720
That cavity is gigantic.

32:50.720 --> 32:50.960
No.

32:50.960 --> 32:51.120
Yeah.

32:51.120 --> 32:53.280
That's just a, you're just begging to feel inadequate.

32:53.280 --> 32:55.520
Two, I think you could make a case for.

32:56.640 --> 33:01.120
It's got a nice curvature, which you guys know I'm a fan of.

33:01.120 --> 33:01.360
Yeah.

33:01.360 --> 33:02.640
You do like curvatures.

33:02.640 --> 33:08.560
The problem with two and five and seven.

33:09.840 --> 33:10.000
Yeah.

33:10.000 --> 33:10.560
And that's it.

33:10.560 --> 33:11.520
Where, where do you put it?

33:12.400 --> 33:12.640
Yeah.

33:12.640 --> 33:13.600
I see what you're saying.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.760
Where do you have to have intercourse with the numeral?

33:15.760 --> 33:16.720
And that is what we're saying.

33:17.280 --> 33:17.840
Right.

33:17.840 --> 33:18.720
Then eight.

33:18.720 --> 33:22.240
Three would be tricky, but I think you could, I think you could do it.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.280
Yeah, I think so too.

33:24.320 --> 33:30.560
I would like to know when this person discovered this problem because it, it could have made

33:30.560 --> 33:34.080
for like the most awkward math class ever when he's sitting there and the teacher's

33:34.080 --> 33:38.240
like, say I have 12 apples and I take five away.

33:38.240 --> 33:39.360
What do you have?

33:39.360 --> 33:40.480
And the answer is boner.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.760
Hey, hey, Griff, are there any answers?

33:45.760 --> 33:47.120
Do you want to help him out at all?

33:47.120 --> 33:51.200
Uh, Diana Quimby says, I like 69.

33:51.200 --> 33:54.960
Oh, that's cool.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.240
Nice try, Diana.

33:56.240 --> 34:00.240
Um, so many, so many.

34:01.360 --> 34:01.920
Okay.

34:01.920 --> 34:02.960
Says yes.

34:02.960 --> 34:03.920
Completely normal.

34:03.920 --> 34:04.560
Have fun.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.080
You're not hurting anyone.

34:06.080 --> 34:06.800
I disagree.

34:07.360 --> 34:12.560
Now I agree with the second half of that sentence, but let's not throw around terms like completely

34:15.360 --> 34:16.800
you rob the words of their power.

34:17.520 --> 34:17.840
Yeah.

34:17.840 --> 34:23.040
I think that I'm a Gleek says everyone has their quirks, I guess.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.560
So neon Nathan, guess what?

34:26.640 --> 34:27.600
Number Nathan.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.720
Hey, number Nathan.

34:28.720 --> 34:29.920
What's up with number Nathan?

34:29.920 --> 34:31.120
He's over there.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.840
He's playing math blaster and he's fucking jerking.

34:33.840 --> 34:36.480
It's so right to math blaster.

34:36.480 --> 34:37.200
Number nookie.

34:37.200 --> 34:37.840
Nathan.

34:37.840 --> 34:38.640
Number nookie.

34:38.640 --> 34:41.360
Nathan jerks it to math blaster.

34:41.360 --> 34:42.400
I heard on the end.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.400
I heard he is the math blaster.

34:44.400 --> 34:52.720
He said, hey, listen, I have a, I have a sister who gives the best presence for Christmas

34:52.720 --> 34:53.440
and every birthday.

34:53.440 --> 34:56.560
She comes up with something so ridiculously amazing that I just can't think of how to

34:56.560 --> 34:57.280
top her.

34:57.280 --> 35:00.400
I know the idea of presence is not to top the other person.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.120
Just one time.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.240
I would like to win.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.880
She's giving me things like a robotic butterfly in a jar.

35:04.880 --> 35:09.040
How do I retaliate in the present war?

35:09.040 --> 35:09.840
Thanks guys.

35:09.840 --> 35:10.800
Presently stumped.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.200
I didn't know that was a thing.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.960
How do you got to quit?

35:15.680 --> 35:16.080
You think?

35:16.640 --> 35:18.960
Yeah, I think you got to stop the present world altogether.

35:18.960 --> 35:22.960
Really lower expectations and then in 10 years get a decent present.

35:22.960 --> 35:23.920
And they're like, wow.

35:23.920 --> 35:28.400
So you're saying like, give someone like a gift certificate that says like, I donated

35:28.400 --> 35:31.760
a tree in your honor for like 10 years in a row.

35:31.760 --> 35:35.840
I got you a goat in a village far, far away.

35:35.840 --> 35:42.720
I think, or you could just bow out by getting like the shittiest present ever.

35:42.720 --> 35:45.360
Just race to the bottom is what I'm saying.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.760
Top yourself that way and top yourself below it.

35:47.760 --> 35:48.880
Cause it's not going to hurt you.

35:48.880 --> 35:53.600
She'll pretend that she loves it still, but then she'll be like, Oh, um, Michael,

35:54.560 --> 35:57.760
Michael just like got me a, what is this?

35:57.760 --> 36:00.480
Barnes and Noble gift certificate, but they're closed down.

36:00.480 --> 36:05.360
Like give her whatever gift certificate for 250.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.000
Okay, great.

36:06.000 --> 36:06.720
Thank you.

36:06.720 --> 36:09.920
Just take her present that she gives you the next year.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.080
Give it back to her with a $5 bill tape too.

36:12.720 --> 36:14.240
Yeah, it's like, what's up now?

36:15.760 --> 36:17.760
I guess it's a little better this year, huh?

36:17.760 --> 36:18.640
I guess it's pretty good.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.400
And it's, it's a crude interest.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.280
It's a crude value.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.600
Um, over, over the, over the passing year.

36:26.800 --> 36:31.280
Um, this is why I don't like presents because it is a competition.

36:31.280 --> 36:31.680
Guess what?

36:31.680 --> 36:32.960
It is a competition.

36:32.960 --> 36:36.400
And you're probably, if you have to ask, you're probably losing.

36:36.400 --> 36:40.480
Hey, by the way, it sounds like your sister's secret might be ThinkGeek.

36:40.480 --> 36:45.680
So maybe you should go to ThinkGeek and, and, uh, check out some of the gifts they have there.

36:45.680 --> 36:47.120
Cause then you might be able to beat her that way.

36:47.760 --> 36:51.760
Ooh, instead of buying the shittiest present ever, just make it.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.280
Then she really can't get mad at you.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.240
Yeah, she really won't see that coming.

36:56.240 --> 36:58.160
What have you done with these clothes pins?

36:58.160 --> 37:04.080
I, I, Michael, I'm looking at it and I honestly can't tell.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.440
What is this supposed to be?

37:05.440 --> 37:06.720
Is this an ashtray?

37:06.720 --> 37:09.600
Because there's a lot of cavities in it.

37:09.600 --> 37:10.400
For ash.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.640
For air ash to slip through.

37:12.640 --> 37:15.440
I'm a hotel housekeeper in Australia.

37:15.440 --> 37:15.760
Whoa.

37:16.800 --> 37:17.680
We have to try it.

37:17.680 --> 37:18.720
I should try an accent.

37:18.720 --> 37:20.480
Should I do an accent for this question?

37:20.480 --> 37:20.720
Yeah.

37:20.720 --> 37:28.160
Oh, I was racially cleaning the room of gas to wash from the states.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.040
Is that good?

37:29.040 --> 37:29.360
Perfect.

37:29.360 --> 37:33.840
It sounded like you were like time traveling and you're like talking to us like in a time

37:33.840 --> 37:34.560
vortex.

37:34.560 --> 37:39.040
He opened up his wallet and asked me what the usual tipping rate is every year.

37:39.040 --> 37:43.600
I told him that unlike in the US, hospitality workers here are paid enough by their employer

37:43.600 --> 37:47.280
that they don't rely on tips as income and that it isn't necessary.

37:47.280 --> 37:50.960
He said, oh, and put his wallet back in his pocket.

37:52.880 --> 37:56.240
I thought tipping was a sign of appreciation for providing a good service.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.760
Should I take this personally?

37:57.760 --> 37:59.200
Should I not have told him the truth?

38:00.080 --> 38:02.960
Or have I just encountered a cheap dick scrape?

38:03.600 --> 38:06.640
Jen, I actually have a theory on this.

38:06.640 --> 38:16.240
I think that anytime you go to another culture, more important to you than money is that you

38:16.240 --> 38:17.760
don't look like a dipshit.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.160
Yeah.

38:18.160 --> 38:22.800
So when this guy got his wallet out and you said we don't really do that so much, he probably

38:22.800 --> 38:28.400
felt like a dipshit so hard that he just put the money away for fear of sounding like a

38:28.400 --> 38:28.800
dipshit.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.360
That would be my guess, at least.

38:31.360 --> 38:33.120
You definitely humiliated him.

38:33.120 --> 38:33.920
He was embarrassed.

38:36.320 --> 38:40.080
What I don't understand is why you didn't take this guy to the fucking cleaners.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.120
Oh, my God.

38:41.120 --> 38:41.920
How much is that?

38:41.920 --> 38:42.720
120%.

38:42.720 --> 38:47.280
Yeah, like over a hundo just because that's how we do it in Australia.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.240
Money means nothing here.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.360
We just give it away.

38:51.920 --> 38:52.160
Yeah.

38:53.040 --> 38:53.920
So give me some of it.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.600
It would mean a lot to me, though, if you gave it to me.

38:57.600 --> 38:58.640
This is why I don't travel.

38:59.840 --> 39:00.640
This is it?

39:00.640 --> 39:02.400
I'm serious because I would do this.

39:02.400 --> 39:06.080
I would be that guy and I'd never recover from that shame, ever.

39:06.080 --> 39:08.160
But here's what I've learned from traveling.

39:08.160 --> 39:13.120
Like you think that someone who is I used to think when I was younger that if I traveled

39:13.120 --> 39:18.720
a lot that things would make more like there is a culture sort of inherent to travel where

39:19.440 --> 39:21.360
like a worldwide culture, you know what I mean?

39:21.360 --> 39:24.880
Like something that if you've been in enough places, you just kind of grok what's going

39:24.880 --> 39:25.280
on.

39:25.280 --> 39:31.680
Griffin and I stayed in a hotel last I guess earlier this month where every night when

39:31.680 --> 39:38.080
we would come to the back to the hotel room, there were floor mats that said sleep well

39:38.080 --> 39:40.160
and and slippers.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.840
It wrapped up in plastic.

39:41.840 --> 39:45.200
We had like we had nightly debates about whether those slippers were free.

39:46.400 --> 39:47.440
There's no rules.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.800
And since you're in Australia, there's no rules just right.

39:51.600 --> 39:52.720
Like like at the outback.

39:54.320 --> 39:55.440
That's what you should tell him.

39:55.440 --> 39:56.560
There's no rules to tipping.

39:56.560 --> 40:00.240
There's just so you're saying just just embrace your ineptitude.

40:00.240 --> 40:04.800
Yeah, at international affairs, just like if I'm going to have another if I'm going

40:04.800 --> 40:08.320
to have enough shrimp to put on the barbie, I need you to tip me right now.

40:08.320 --> 40:11.200
Why are you wearing why are you wearing a Hawaiian shirt?

40:11.200 --> 40:16.480
You you do realize that not all islands are like the same.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.880
This isn't like a tropical resort for you.

40:18.880 --> 40:19.760
Like we live here.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.240
You're wearing sunscreen.

40:22.240 --> 40:24.000
You're indoors and you're wearing sunscreen.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.960
My advice is don't screen on your nose.

40:26.960 --> 40:32.160
Is be careful not to use the word necessary because I think that people only tip because

40:32.160 --> 40:33.440
it is necessary.

40:33.440 --> 40:36.800
And if you say that's not necessary, that translates to don't do it.

40:37.840 --> 40:43.040
So maybe say like, well, you know, if you really appreciate the service, then we accept

40:43.040 --> 40:46.000
tips, but it's not required.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.680
Tipping is such a sensitive thing.

40:47.680 --> 40:51.760
I don't know why this guy would would breach that sensitivity and be like, hey, do you

40:51.760 --> 40:52.320
need this?

40:53.280 --> 40:54.560
Like wave it in front of you.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.160
Do you have some troubles?

40:56.160 --> 40:59.840
Well, how much of what I have do you need to be happy?

40:59.840 --> 41:01.040
I've got it to give.

41:01.040 --> 41:04.160
Do you need it to have like I've got a vein open.

41:04.160 --> 41:04.800
Come drink.

41:06.320 --> 41:10.000
I think next time to say 10 percent and go about your business.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.640
I think that's that's that's also that's kind of a dick move, by the way.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.360
Don't ask this person what the usual tipping rate is.

41:18.080 --> 41:19.120
What are you thinking?

41:19.840 --> 41:25.040
Ask like the somebody, somebody else, your cabbie or literally anybody else tips.

41:25.040 --> 41:30.560
No, I'm having trouble thinking of people that she would interact with that that would

41:30.560 --> 41:31.680
not require tips.

41:31.680 --> 41:33.440
I could be impartial.

41:33.440 --> 41:33.840
Nope.

41:33.840 --> 41:34.160
Tips.

41:35.360 --> 41:36.960
Have you ever seen the secret of my success story?

41:38.720 --> 41:39.840
Not in too long.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.800
Yeah, I tipped a soda machine in a hotel once.

41:43.440 --> 41:44.640
I just put another dollar in.

41:44.640 --> 41:45.600
I was like, that's for you.

41:45.600 --> 41:46.080
Good job.

41:47.760 --> 41:50.880
For a second, I thought it was it was going to turn into a real like Bret Michaels story.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.680
Like you tipped a soda machine and then you kicked it down a flight of stairs.

41:53.680 --> 41:57.120
But no, I would never hurt a soda machine like that.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.120
Do you want to answer?

41:59.120 --> 42:01.120
Yeah, I was just about to ask for one.

42:01.120 --> 42:06.880
This one was sent in by America's favorite person, Jacob Blocker.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.800
There was a time poll and he won it for that thing.

42:11.600 --> 42:16.800
It's by Yahoo Answers user Bowler, who asks, I need tickle fetish help.

42:16.800 --> 42:22.640
So, I have a tickle fetish and I was wondering if there is a tool I can use to tickle my feet,

42:22.640 --> 42:24.480
such as an electric toothbrush or something.

42:27.040 --> 42:27.600
That's it.

42:31.520 --> 42:33.440
It's really a question of reach, isn't it?

42:33.440 --> 42:36.960
I mean, I imagine when you have a tickle fetish, I can't tickle myself.

42:36.960 --> 42:40.640
Like, I don't know how you're supposed to do it without the help of some sort of tools.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.480
I didn't think this was a thing.

42:43.440 --> 42:45.840
I have a boner to tickle myself.

42:45.840 --> 42:46.880
Boner, do you?

42:48.000 --> 42:49.040
Stop, stop.

42:49.040 --> 42:49.600
Don't stop.

42:50.240 --> 42:51.040
Don't stop.

42:51.040 --> 42:51.840
Do stop.

42:51.840 --> 42:52.960
I have a boner.

42:52.960 --> 42:53.760
No, please.

42:53.760 --> 42:54.720
It's uncomfortable now.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.400
You have been tickling me for too long.

42:56.400 --> 42:57.120
I have a fetish.

42:57.120 --> 42:58.400
It doesn't mean I'm not a masochist.

42:58.400 --> 43:02.080
You should really, I think that if you have a tickle fetish, you need to become the person

43:02.080 --> 43:05.520
who warns every single person you come across that you have a tickle fetish.

43:05.520 --> 43:06.960
You're getting a job interview.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.800
They're like, is there anything else you need to tell us?

43:08.800 --> 43:13.440
Well, I have a tickle fetish, which I need you to know because you can't ever come up

43:13.440 --> 43:17.600
to me in my cubicle and be like, hey, Johnson, come here.

43:17.600 --> 43:18.480
Fluffy fingers.

43:18.480 --> 43:25.120
And then it's like, boss man, I have a boner now that I have to deal with for the rest

43:25.120 --> 43:27.040
of the day that you gave to me.

43:27.040 --> 43:27.520
And I have to like-

43:27.520 --> 43:28.640
Because I'm rock hard.

43:28.640 --> 43:31.600
I got to go home to my wife and kids and they'll be like, how's your day?

43:31.600 --> 43:32.240
It was pretty good.

43:32.240 --> 43:33.920
My boss gave me a tickle boner.

43:34.640 --> 43:37.360
So I guess actually what I said about it being pretty good was wrong.

43:38.080 --> 43:39.360
It's the opposite of that.

43:39.360 --> 43:45.440
I'm still chewing on that factoid.

43:45.440 --> 43:49.760
Um, I guess a backscratcher.

43:49.760 --> 43:50.960
Like would that work?

43:50.960 --> 43:51.440
Or a broom?

43:51.440 --> 43:53.680
Like one of those long ones with a foot- a broom?

43:55.200 --> 43:55.520
How about-

43:56.080 --> 43:57.920
Most witches just have tickle fetishes.

43:57.920 --> 43:59.280
A lot of people don't know that.

43:59.280 --> 44:00.960
Are there- is this a thing?

44:00.960 --> 44:02.400
I guess I'm just surprised that this is a thing.

44:02.400 --> 44:07.760
Like, are there people who like go to prostitutes and they're like $50 for a BJ Hundo for a

44:07.760 --> 44:08.720
Minnesota pincher?

44:08.720 --> 44:11.920
And you're like, how much just for like a- how much for fluffy fingers?

44:13.440 --> 44:14.640
How about you just tickle me?

44:15.200 --> 44:16.560
Do you want- I'll tickle you.

44:17.520 --> 44:20.320
I will tickle you to titter but not to full chuckle.

44:20.320 --> 44:24.960
And then they'll get confused and be like, like your penis?

44:24.960 --> 44:26.000
Like you want me to tickle your penis?

44:26.000 --> 44:26.960
Like, oh no, no, no.

44:26.960 --> 44:27.840
I'm not ticklish there.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.080
I'm ticklish on my- on my tummy.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.320
If you could just give me tummy honks.

44:33.520 --> 44:36.960
If you can get up under my armpits and maybe my big toes.

44:36.960 --> 44:38.800
I have- here's what I have.

44:38.800 --> 44:39.840
I have tummy honks.

44:39.840 --> 44:40.720
Those are on the table.

44:40.720 --> 44:41.360
That's $25.

44:42.240 --> 44:46.880
I'll give you- I'll give you pit pushers where I get up in there and really squeeze and tickle

44:46.880 --> 44:47.280
you.

44:47.280 --> 44:48.240
That's no problem.

44:48.240 --> 44:49.120
Fluffy fingers.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.000
That's gonna cost you.

44:50.000 --> 44:50.640
Oh man.

44:50.640 --> 44:52.160
And also kissing on the mouth.

44:52.160 --> 44:52.880
$150.

44:53.520 --> 44:55.040
So if you want to add that service.

44:56.240 --> 45:01.680
We also offer a nice- a nice relax afterwards because you need to cool down from the tickle.

45:01.680 --> 45:03.920
You get a oolong tea and a time life.

45:03.920 --> 45:08.640
Time life book about the old west.

45:08.640 --> 45:12.800
You sit and drink your oolong and read your time life book about-

45:12.800 --> 45:14.320
Stellar tickle.

45:14.320 --> 45:15.760
I'm gonna learn about cowboys.

45:17.760 --> 45:20.000
Good, good, good tickle.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.440
Uh, I wonder what Apache, uh, relations were like.

45:23.440 --> 45:25.440
Diane, you were worth every penny.

45:26.240 --> 45:29.200
I am- I am giggling like a schoolboy over here.

45:29.200 --> 45:31.120
Can you be a dove and nuke my oolong?

45:31.120 --> 45:36.960
I got so into this part about, uh, hatchet crafting.

45:36.960 --> 45:40.400
Do you know what the nice thing is about going to a tickle prostitute?

45:40.400 --> 45:40.880
What's that?

45:41.680 --> 45:44.640
Um, you get a happy beginning, middle, and end.

45:50.880 --> 45:52.720
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

45:53.360 --> 45:56.080
But first quick housekeeping type stuff.

45:56.800 --> 45:58.800
You've been listening to my brother, my brother, and me.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.440
As always, the nicest thing you can do for us is tell a friend.

46:03.200 --> 46:05.440
We have a lot of people who do that, you know, in meat space.

46:06.080 --> 46:08.720
Just say, hey, listen to this.

46:08.720 --> 46:12.160
And then they jam like a USB drive or a disk.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.160
And then we have people who do it on the internet.

46:15.120 --> 46:20.080
Uh, like Joe Patrick, uh, 116.

46:20.800 --> 46:23.120
Mike Tartt is up on there.

46:23.120 --> 46:25.600
Anybody- anybody else really been killing it this week?

46:26.320 --> 46:27.200
Uh, Jeff Grubb.

46:27.200 --> 46:29.120
Uh, Jeff Grubb.

46:29.680 --> 46:31.760
Uh, there's Alsmane Mariko.

46:31.760 --> 46:32.640
Always killing it.

46:32.640 --> 46:34.240
A hundred percent of the time.

46:34.240 --> 46:36.080
Uh, tech monkeys.

46:36.080 --> 46:36.800
Oh, Christ.

46:37.440 --> 46:38.240
Cory Dutson.

46:38.880 --> 46:43.600
C Dutson on Twitter created- well, we created griffinspacejam.com with a rough-

46:44.400 --> 46:46.080
a rough draft, I would say.

46:46.080 --> 46:47.600
The first installment.

46:48.320 --> 46:50.880
C Dutson turned up the fucking heat.

46:51.680 --> 46:56.480
It is now a full sensory sort of experience.

46:56.480 --> 47:00.240
There's- if you want sight, there's sight.

47:00.240 --> 47:03.360
If you want read, which is one of your senses, there's read.

47:03.360 --> 47:04.800
You can read there.

47:04.800 --> 47:07.440
Sound, he's got the- he put the jingle on there.

47:07.440 --> 47:09.680
It's- it's such a fucking delight.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.040
I'm so happy that I made it.

47:11.040 --> 47:12.000
Thank you, C Dutson.

47:12.640 --> 47:13.120
Try that.

47:13.120 --> 47:14.240
So you should follow him.

47:15.200 --> 47:17.920
Man, that- that is a good website.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.360
It's like the best website.

47:19.360 --> 47:20.000
I can't believe that somebody made that.

47:20.000 --> 47:23.120
My dream is that it continues to be more productive.

47:23.120 --> 47:26.320
Like, it's more useful until it passes Google.

47:26.320 --> 47:27.200
Do you think maybe-

47:27.200 --> 47:28.480
That's everybody's homepage.

47:28.480 --> 47:32.480
Everybody has a secret, like, love of the Space Jam franchise in their heart,

47:32.480 --> 47:34.080
but they- they don't know, like,

47:34.080 --> 47:37.680
I need a safe place where I can go and talk about how much I love Lola

47:37.680 --> 47:41.040
because she's so- she's just so feminine and delicate.

47:41.760 --> 47:42.720
You can do that here.

47:43.280 --> 47:44.720
By the way, everybody, here's a fun little-

47:45.440 --> 47:47.680
little interactive adventure you can go on right now.

47:47.680 --> 47:53.120
Uh, if you get on YouTube and search Bugs and Lola, and then just, like, go on a journey.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.840
Just, like, watch the videos that come up because you are going to love them.

47:56.640 --> 48:04.160
You're really- um, also, if you are in the Chicago land area or you can get there,

48:05.440 --> 48:07.360
uh, you need to go to MaximumFun.org.

48:08.480 --> 48:14.240
You need to look for that link about our show that we're doing live there.

48:14.240 --> 48:19.520
Uh, and- and- or you can just go to the Second City website, uh, April 17th.

48:19.520 --> 48:20.800
We're going to be there with Jordan Jessica.

48:20.800 --> 48:26.480
Um, we're going to be opening for them, and then they're going to do their thing.

48:26.480 --> 48:31.200
And the whole night will be hosted by Dan Telfer, who is fucking hilarious.

48:31.200 --> 48:31.920
He's so funny.

48:31.920 --> 48:35.920
If you watch his, uh- he's got a video on YouTube called The Best Dinosaur.

48:35.920 --> 48:37.440
Jesus Christ.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.000
Go watch it.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.520
It's the fucking funniest thing.

48:39.520 --> 48:40.400
Uh, so Dan-

48:40.400 --> 48:43.040
And as an added bonus, um, April 17th,

48:43.040 --> 48:48.080
is Griffin's birthday, so we'll probably be going out afterwards and doing, like, a meetup thing.

48:48.080 --> 48:49.920
We're going to get fucked up Sunday night.

48:50.480 --> 48:50.960
Yeah.

48:50.960 --> 48:51.920
Don't tell Jesus.

48:51.920 --> 48:54.640
Don't tell Jesus Griffin's drunk guy's birthday.

48:54.640 --> 48:57.440
Um, so- so make sure you get tickets for that.

48:57.440 --> 49:00.000
Uh, we cover Twitter.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.080
If you have questions for us, nbnbam at MaximumFun.org.

49:04.080 --> 49:06.880
Um, and you follow us on Twitter.

49:06.880 --> 49:11.840
We- we're- we're- we're climbing the ranks here, but we still need more of you to- to join us.

49:11.840 --> 49:13.840
So, uh-

49:13.840 --> 49:16.080
We're all on Twitter separately, too.

49:16.080 --> 49:17.280
It's just that I think we-

49:17.280 --> 49:19.520
Hey, we broke three- we broke 3,000.

49:19.520 --> 49:20.480
Hey, all right.

49:20.480 --> 49:21.040
Yay.

49:21.040 --> 49:21.600
Pretty good, right?

49:21.600 --> 49:24.640
Um, if you want a promotion, if you want to take us to the Money Zone,

49:24.640 --> 49:29.600
and we'll take you to the Jingle Zone, uh, you can email Teresa at MaximumFun.org.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.360
Uh, this is Teresa with an H.

49:31.360 --> 49:34.400
I know some people- some people like to eschew the H.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.840
Uh, Travis, you're dating an H-less Teresa.

49:38.480 --> 49:41.680
I gotta say, I can't- I- I don't know how I feel about that.

49:41.680 --> 49:43.680
You didn't console us before that.

49:43.680 --> 49:44.240
Me neither.

49:45.200 --> 49:48.560
If you guys get married and she has to change her name, can she just pop that H in there?

49:48.560 --> 49:49.680
Just very-

49:49.680 --> 49:50.560
I'll see what I can do.

49:51.280 --> 49:52.560
I mean, I'll definitely bring it up.

49:53.200 --> 49:53.600
Thanks.

49:53.600 --> 49:58.160
Um, so I- I believe, uh, that is- that is everything.

49:58.160 --> 50:00.320
Thank you guys, as always, so much for hanging out with us.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.880
Um, we will, of course, be back.

50:02.880 --> 50:06.720
Sorry we missed a couple Mondays there, but we're back on- on the regular schedule now,

50:06.720 --> 50:09.200
so make sure you- you check that out.

50:10.080 --> 50:11.040
Check us out.

50:11.040 --> 50:13.440
Check- check our show out at Archives.

50:17.600 --> 50:19.200
Go ahead, Kevin, whenever you're ready.

50:19.200 --> 50:20.240
I'm gonna call this out.

50:20.240 --> 50:22.400
Travis just, uh, wrote us a message on Skype.

50:23.120 --> 50:27.680
Sometimes he does this whenever he does things during the show, uh, that he wants me to edit

50:27.680 --> 50:34.560
out in- in post, uh, and it says, I farted at 54 minutes, so I'll make sure to stop back in

50:34.560 --> 50:41.120
and cut that- cut that flatulence out, but I am leaving this in so that people know what you did.

50:41.120 --> 50:42.960
I could've sworn I heard it.

50:42.960 --> 50:46.320
If you go back and play, I don't know if you could edit it in,

50:46.320 --> 50:49.040
but he made a sound afterwards, like, what happened?

50:49.040 --> 50:49.280
Let me just-

50:49.280 --> 50:50.160
What did I do?

50:50.160 --> 50:53.840
Let me highlight that waveform, amplify 20 dBs.

50:54.960 --> 50:55.680
Sorry about your speakers.

50:55.680 --> 50:58.000
For a half of a second, I forgot where I was,

50:58.560 --> 51:01.360
which happens to me quite often and once happened to me on the bus,

51:01.360 --> 51:04.960
but it's one of those moments where it's just like extreme comfort fart.

51:04.960 --> 51:05.440
Oh, no.

51:06.800 --> 51:09.120
And then I try to cover it up with a throat clear.

51:10.960 --> 51:12.240
Time traveled for a second.

51:12.240 --> 51:13.840
You just got lost in the moment.

51:13.840 --> 51:15.360
This is the grossest podcast.

51:15.360 --> 51:16.560
I hate it.

How about this one was sent in by Kevin Frida.

51:18.720 --> 51:19.360
Thank you, Kevin.

It's by Yahoo Answers user, The Casual Fan Rises, who asks,

51:25.760 --> 51:27.760
Ladies, imagine this.

51:27.760 --> 51:30.560
I have X-ray vision and I can see through your clothes.

51:30.560 --> 51:31.200
What now?

51:35.840 --> 51:37.200
Justin McElroy.

51:37.200 --> 51:38.320
This is Travis McElroy.

51:38.320 --> 51:39.840
I'm Griffin McElroy.

51:39.840 --> 51:41.760
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

51:41.760 --> 51:42.480
Kiss your dad.

51:42.480 --> 52:01.680
It's all right on the lips.
