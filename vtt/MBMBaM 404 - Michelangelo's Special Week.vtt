The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.680
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother my brother made advice show for the modern era. I'm

00:47.680 --> 00:53.120
your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy. I am your sweet

00:53.120 --> 00:58.400
baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary girlfriend McElroy. Speaking of babies, yes,

00:58.400 --> 01:05.360
they done did the thing they had another there's another royal baby who I saw a lot of uh news

01:05.360 --> 01:11.040
outlets just simply referring to as second boy which I thought was really funny boy you're the

01:11.040 --> 01:16.400
second boy second boy can be third boy yeah yes you can be the third boy you can be best boy key

01:16.400 --> 01:24.480
grip three boy me who me three boy I love this new baby I can't wait for him to reign over all us

01:24.480 --> 01:32.800
yes I can't wait to follow this baby's every command die in his beautiful army I like second

01:32.800 --> 01:43.120
boy I question their decision to have invoiced by will arnett it's a little much who even wins in

01:43.120 --> 01:48.880
the fight between the boss baby and the king baby right amazing yeah because I think boss baby would

01:48.880 --> 01:56.960
make you know goo goo gaga hand me my briefcase but king baby's like die in my army kick boy boss

01:56.960 --> 02:02.480
baby I also think that the crossover when they added the minions to work for a second boy that

02:02.480 --> 02:07.200
was what are they even little yellow babies I don't even know they look like tic tacs what's

02:07.200 --> 02:13.600
going on there what's up I do love that they call the future king baby they named him Ralph I think

02:13.600 --> 02:20.240
hysterical and the way prince the prince of him the bad prince yeah lowered his sunglasses

02:20.240 --> 02:24.880
when he said it is like the baby oh he'll be king ralph and then he liked and then the

02:24.880 --> 02:30.320
banners dropped which I thought was pretty cool it's so good when I was getting my haircut

02:31.120 --> 02:38.960
the person cutting my hair talked to me completely unironically I thought you were just gonna stop

02:38.960 --> 02:45.920
there no completely ironically at length about the new baby second boy and it seems like that

02:45.920 --> 02:52.800
should be against the law because it was a lot of like you could tell like comments like you could

02:52.800 --> 02:58.480
tell that they really love each other and I think it's really nice the baby is being raised in such

02:58.480 --> 03:06.800
a loving environment and I mean a lot of different things that I had a lot of comments that I had to

03:06.800 --> 03:14.080
ingest about the baby king and it seems like unfair cut in that position right I can't I'm

03:14.080 --> 03:20.960
captive I'm a hair so sorry Justin I'm sorry I just want to clarify please king baby because

03:20.960 --> 03:26.800
baby king sounds like the king of babies might be I think that might be how it works baby is a

03:27.600 --> 03:32.400
Kate Beaton book that I don't want to I don't want to step on Kate's trademark

03:32.400 --> 03:35.840
what have you all brought for the king baby I thought maybe we could take a moment here

03:35.840 --> 03:42.960
present him with our it's our new segment hold on what's your tribute all right oh sweet baby

03:42.960 --> 03:48.640
happy birthday welcome to earth you're gonna make such a special impact I brought you something

03:48.640 --> 03:55.440
that you don't have over here across the pond a fishy ships but I'm so sorry for that king

03:55.440 --> 04:02.160
baby but anyway here is my tribute for you please do not dragoon me into your crusade

04:02.160 --> 04:08.080
but I did bring you all my old tech decks and you are gonna love these maybe maybe daddy can show

04:08.080 --> 04:14.640
you because of harry harry harry you remember harry you remember griffin harry's the uncle

04:15.280 --> 04:22.480
who's the daddy that's william bill king bill king bill you remember doing the flips because harry is

04:22.480 --> 04:28.960
the prunkle prince uncle now oh you're right okay let me take it again okay uh bill you remember

04:28.960 --> 04:34.320
oh you swallowed him you swallowed all the tech no oh his guts are skateboarding around doing vert

04:34.320 --> 04:44.400
ramps off the big intestine oh shoot guys I'm so sorry I shit it up real bad travis what's your

04:44.400 --> 04:54.720
tribute um my tribute is myself I have been um working out um I so that I can defend uh king

04:54.720 --> 05:04.080
baby what a sweet boy oh happy birthday you know justin he's here what did your what's your tribute

05:04.080 --> 05:11.120
can you do the can you do the jingling I can't remember what's your tribute mine's mustard and

05:12.400 --> 05:19.440
yeah because if the baby may be young for mustard now but if we start the baby on mustard at 12

05:19.440 --> 05:24.400
months uh maybe it's actually six months we can start with mustard because it's not solid food

05:24.400 --> 05:30.880
if we start the baby with mustard at six months then by the time he has reached fluency with

05:30.880 --> 05:38.240
adulthood you know what I mean then he'll be the one that loves mustard and I might

05:39.120 --> 05:44.320
have a shot at telling these fucking people apart when I am being told about their various

05:44.320 --> 05:49.680
exploits and so the mustard it can all be in reference for me at least I'll have one fucking

05:49.680 --> 05:56.880
king touchstone where I can say is that the mom of the one who loves mustard is that the one who

05:56.880 --> 06:03.280
loves mustard's cousin is that the son of the one who loves mustard at least I'll have something

06:03.280 --> 06:08.960
that can help me decode that explains the t-shirt when they presented royal baby to the crowds the

06:08.960 --> 06:15.040
t-shirt that said I'll be your anchor point or king baby is your constant that's what my constant

06:15.040 --> 06:20.640
royal family could that apparently people over here are just gaga for even though we we threw

06:20.640 --> 06:27.280
off their shackles of their rule they are now ruling our social media and what have you through

06:27.280 --> 06:33.200
these extremely important babies that everyone is just just gaga over if you'll pardon the

06:33.760 --> 06:40.320
did you not hear me earlier when I said I say I uh thank you I'm reinforcing your bet oh thank you

06:40.320 --> 06:46.400
thank you so much oh king baby oh what if dastardly first baby then decides that they

06:46.400 --> 06:54.000
also like mustard just in your whole plans got no one else can have mustard okay period the end

06:54.000 --> 06:59.760
good luck enforcing that Sydney brought something out to me that I the only thing I think is

06:59.760 --> 07:04.640
interesting about the royal family besides the one who loves mustard the new baby who probably

07:04.640 --> 07:12.240
does have a name um prince mustard prince mustard did you realize that every time they crank out

07:12.240 --> 07:20.400
another one it kicks harry down another notch in the lineage boy that's got to be a mixed bag of

07:20.400 --> 07:27.520
emotions huh you know I thought about that's cool so I'm six now huh okay cool so it's just the one

07:27.520 --> 07:36.480
baby boy and then the baby girl and then this other baby and then great y'all too nice I'm not

07:36.480 --> 07:42.400
the duke of uh north North Shenshire anymore cool that's the babies now great can't wait to see how

07:42.400 --> 07:48.720
they run it so I guess I'll just hand over the paperwork great here's my scepter baby enjoy

07:48.720 --> 07:56.560
enjoy that scepter uh excuse me erry could you scoot down please could you scoot down but there's

07:56.560 --> 08:05.120
no more there's no more bench uh-huh we'll just pull up a folding chair for you harry at the end

08:05.120 --> 08:13.200
there harry thank you make some room for me to put this fucking uh car seat that I pulled out

08:13.200 --> 08:20.560
I'm just gonna sit here at our very fancy uh uh secession table I think that maybe like there's

08:20.560 --> 08:27.040
but there's benefits to it too I maybe like every time there's a new royal baby prince harry like

08:27.040 --> 08:31.520
things like oh I'm one step closer to being able to get that face tattoo I've always wanted you

08:31.520 --> 08:38.480
know like oh yeah no chance yeah it's no chance oh yeah yeah oh finally oh I'm so close to just

08:38.480 --> 08:43.600
being able to retire you know what I mean because like right being a prince for life isn't bad but

08:43.600 --> 08:48.480
if it's like oh no you're the you know you're gonna get the call man you're on call that's a

08:48.480 --> 08:55.120
lot of pressure to be ready to king at any point you know just take over it at any point it's it's

08:55.120 --> 09:01.600
terrifying too much and that's it okay shoo 10 minutes we did it everybody got 10 minutes out

09:01.600 --> 09:06.560
of the royal family not get it twisted that is gonna end up being a tight five and a half by the

09:06.560 --> 09:11.920
time okay well we have recorded for 10 minutes and honestly that's all I can do uh that's as far

09:11.920 --> 09:17.360
as I can that the whole episode that's that's basically the entire no we got all all kinds of

09:17.360 --> 09:26.800
fun stuff I live on the third and top story of a walk up with one other neighbor sharing the

09:26.800 --> 09:32.000
landing outside my door I do not know these neighbors well but I've seen them passing

09:32.000 --> 09:36.800
sometimes they will put a bag of trash outside their door to be taken down later this does not

09:36.800 --> 09:41.200
bother me because I know they have young children it would be difficult for them to run the trash

09:41.200 --> 09:46.240
down every time it's full thank you occasionally when I'm taking my own trash down or taking my

09:46.240 --> 09:51.840
dog out I think oh I should just grab that and run it down for them then I stop and think no don't

09:51.840 --> 09:57.760
do that they will go crazy trying to figure out what happened to their trash is that too weird

09:57.760 --> 10:03.200
or just something a nice neighbor would do what should I do that's from Waste Bag Weirdo in

10:03.200 --> 10:09.520
Washington first of all they're not the stupids so they're not gonna think somebody's stolen their

10:09.520 --> 10:15.280
trash and you need to perish that thought nobody on earth would ever be upset at their trash going

10:15.280 --> 10:20.640
away and in fact if you did that to my house I would name my next child after you it was gonna

10:20.640 --> 10:25.680
be Prince Mustard but I will name them Waste Bag Weirdo in Washington if you did this for me to

10:25.680 --> 10:30.800
never touch that trash again this is such a bad thing because you put out your trash and you set

10:30.800 --> 10:36.480
it down but not in the can and it's like oh I got a date with you later don't I stinky bag

10:38.960 --> 10:42.800
I think maybe maybe you take the trash bag and you leave a quarter

10:44.000 --> 10:50.400
and you start to develop like a whole mythos about like the trash trash fairy yeah I think that

10:50.400 --> 10:55.600
yeah a fairy can lift a tooth the tooth is quite small I don't think they're gonna have the you

10:55.600 --> 11:02.320
know the guns to lift up a full bag full of probably diapers which are the heaviest the

11:02.320 --> 11:08.080
heaviest substance on earth is diapers trash gremlin trash gremlin could be fun but then

11:08.080 --> 11:12.640
it couldn't be a quarter it'd have to be like a little buggy worm or something yeah a little

11:12.640 --> 11:18.960
grubbing I think you're creating behavior with this that it that will be damaging to this person

11:18.960 --> 11:26.160
in the long run uh because if if one time I put my trash outside my front door and it disappeared

11:26.720 --> 11:33.600
I would never ever ever carry my trash down again never you've taught me that some that somehow

11:33.600 --> 11:39.520
it's getting down there so I would not go through the extra work of taking it all the way down for

11:39.520 --> 11:44.240
the rest of my life your mind is so good at filling in gaps especially when those gaps involve

11:44.240 --> 11:50.080
touching the trash ever again or doing any work ever I would just assume that like the police

11:50.080 --> 11:54.880
have started doing this for us like oh yeah the police have a new service so they'll come into our

11:54.880 --> 11:59.440
walk up and then go up to the third floor and they'll just grab the trash out of there thanks

11:59.440 --> 12:04.320
I sure am glad we elected that new mayor yeah really taking care of the church I will say

12:04.320 --> 12:08.480
that the problem here is if you do this consistently to Justin's point if you do this

12:08.480 --> 12:13.360
like four times in a row right and then on the fifth time you don't and they open the door and

12:13.360 --> 12:19.920
the trash is still there they're gonna be like oh no is neighbor person mad at us I am incapable of

12:19.920 --> 12:25.600
not just taking the trash to the can and putting it in there because 100% of the time a trash bag

12:25.600 --> 12:29.840
is gonna have chicken juice in it and I don't care if you're a vegan and it doesn't have chicken

12:29.840 --> 12:35.840
juice in it I don't care if it's just if it's just lawn clippings that you did from your apartment

12:35.840 --> 12:40.560
where you have inside grass and you put that in a bag and you put it out on the floor outside

12:40.560 --> 12:45.920
you're gonna have a big chicken juice puddle it is just the default state of trash they gonna

12:45.920 --> 12:50.960
they're gonna find the bones and there will be raccoons that are gonna pull bones out of it even

12:50.960 --> 12:56.240
if there's not bones they'll find a bone in there there's a bone in there somewhere and they're

12:56.240 --> 13:01.040
gonna find it raccoons I was just gonna say that I've been running a long-term scam on my trash

13:01.040 --> 13:06.720
guys where that I bring my adorable children out to thank them every time they come get the trash

13:06.720 --> 13:11.840
and that is one because it's just a nice thing to do it's probably kind of a thankless job all the

13:11.840 --> 13:17.280
time so I like to go out there and say thank you and you know leave a nice tip around the holidays

13:17.280 --> 13:23.120
you know I like to take care of them so I can throw progressively weirder things away not just

13:23.120 --> 13:29.920
weirder but bigger like every time I don't like like I'll send Charlie out there and we'll kind

13:29.920 --> 13:35.360
of like wave because I'm afraid to go out by myself because I hate watching their reactions to

13:35.360 --> 13:39.120
see what they think about the things that I've tried to throw away because I'll try to throw away

13:39.120 --> 13:44.240
a lot of things that I probably should take somewhere where grown-ups will handle it for me

13:44.240 --> 13:48.640
and when they do a double take at it when they do a double take there's only so many times you can

13:48.640 --> 13:55.840
say I know right before you just have to stop doing it my Christmas tree is the one that I feel

13:55.840 --> 14:01.360
juice just yeah because it's like there's certainly a place those are supposed to go

14:01.360 --> 14:07.440
but I don't know where or how so I just put that out there it's lucky that it comes right after

14:07.440 --> 14:11.840
that good old Christmas tip yeah because hopefully that's still fresh in their minds when they think

14:11.840 --> 14:17.040
I'll just throw this dead ass tree in my truck do you do you wrap it up like Laura Palmer you just

14:17.040 --> 14:26.640
like leave it out there wrapped in plastic okay uh how about a yahoo there's bang go ahead in the

14:26.640 --> 14:38.560
percolator uh it's from merit palm it's from yahoo answers user uh they're anonymous so I'm

14:38.560 --> 14:51.040
gonna call him bob asks oh no that yum you're like asks yes is yahoo a good stock

14:51.040 --> 15:05.120
sorry where is this from when is this from oh that's a good question a week ago a week ago

15:05.120 --> 15:11.680
you're hard no are you kidding 1999 sure buddy let her rip but keep your finger on the on the

15:11.680 --> 15:17.920
escape hatch because it'll be good forever um so we never talk about the you know the

15:17.920 --> 15:24.000
the bull and the bear that we like to wrestle with sometimes that we call the stock market

15:24.000 --> 15:31.040
because it can be so exciting and you put your money in and then you see what happens maybe good

15:31.040 --> 15:39.680
nothing ever goes wrong sometime it goes wrong uh pets.com went bad um oh shit did not work out

15:39.680 --> 15:44.400
pets.com did i be honest i haven't checked in a while i put a lot of money into pets.com

15:44.400 --> 15:48.000
all right well check actually do see oh you know what it just bumped back up

15:49.520 --> 15:53.440
you just made a million dollars and that's every day you did put in a billion dollars though

15:53.440 --> 16:01.120
that's every day that's every day on this market that we call stock because it's so exciting and so

16:01.120 --> 16:05.680
this person either has many dollars invested in yahoo and doesn't know how to read the little

16:05.680 --> 16:11.600
ticker uh which i don't blame them for it's like i don't know what the symbol is for yahoo um if

16:11.600 --> 16:17.120
it's any indication of like what their service is actually like it's just farts it says like farts

16:17.120 --> 16:23.360
negative a million percent no money left but knowing what we know about this service is yahoo

16:23.360 --> 16:32.480
a good stock well it okay here's the thing if you think about it isn't everything a stock market

16:33.600 --> 16:38.080
you know because you're like you're choosing to invest in friendship or you're choosing to invest

16:38.080 --> 16:44.640
in like fandom or you're choosing so maybe we should look at this as like if am i is as yahoo

16:44.640 --> 16:55.040
answers a good thing for me to invest my time and brainwaves into which is no but then again

16:55.040 --> 17:01.520
we we invested in it 404 episodes ago real hard and it's paid off it's paid off big dividends for

17:01.520 --> 17:06.080
us but i do love the idea of a friend stock market because you just be like how's terry doing like

17:06.080 --> 17:11.280
actually that one thought it was a blue chip way in the red on that one farted right in my car and

17:11.280 --> 17:20.000
so it took a big downturn the terry stock sell sell sell get rid of terry sell terry anybody

17:20.000 --> 17:26.560
looking to pick up some terry i got i got terry for dimes on the dollar come on i used to think

17:26.560 --> 17:33.280
hey do you want to hang out today todd oh i can't actually chuck bought up all my terry stock

17:33.280 --> 17:38.800
stock i'll tell you about my terry stock i gotta i gotta go and uh divest but i heard he got uh

17:38.800 --> 17:44.640
recently some butt surgery so this one's looking real good uh a lot of upswings in the future

17:44.640 --> 17:50.240
you know how you always see the people running around all higgledy-piggledy on the the floor of

17:50.240 --> 17:53.680
the stock market whenever people are talking about it that's like the image that you see like

17:53.680 --> 17:58.880
everybody going buck wild out there with all like papers in hand and they're yelling about stuff

17:58.880 --> 18:08.320
until a an upsettingly recent point i thought that when they sold a stock they had to find

18:08.320 --> 18:15.120
someone to sell it to i thought that they had to find someone who would be like yo buy that

18:17.680 --> 18:21.760
i thought that's why they were running around so wild because they were trying to find somebody

18:21.760 --> 18:27.360
who would buy the best i got i got like 100 chiquita shares anybody like bananas i've got

18:27.360 --> 18:34.160
kids i like bananas i got you good price do i'm doing trades if anybody's got one of the

18:34.160 --> 18:42.880
walt disney world commemorative pins from the like 87 debut i got a pikachu anybody need a

18:42.880 --> 18:49.040
pikachu for chiquita i got 100 chiquitas 100 chiquitas for like a bulbasaur maybe i don't

18:49.040 --> 18:54.160
know how this works got a cadabra i'm looking for 10 shares of google this dude's gonna evolve when

18:54.160 --> 18:59.120
i trade him so that's that's a that's a money earner right there justin if it makes you feel

18:59.120 --> 19:06.480
any better i'm 34 i still don't 100 know what this could be fun so they run around the stock market

19:06.480 --> 19:10.240
floor and they got the pieces of paper that i guess have either the stocks on it or an

19:10.240 --> 19:14.480
amount of money that they have and it's just a way of sort of really thin pieces of paper

19:14.480 --> 19:20.160
because i think they can't afford like thick paper yeah yeah they're famously uh unwealthy

19:20.160 --> 19:25.920
so let's go around and just sort of describe how we think stock market works uh and justin maybe

19:25.920 --> 19:33.360
you can start with it i well i feel like i described how i i did think that that it went

19:33.360 --> 19:39.040
yeah um uh you roll up you show up you you get out of your fancy car and you walk inside you

19:39.040 --> 19:46.320
have a few slips of paper that i guess say like you know uh yo play yo play basketball and eggs

19:46.320 --> 19:51.600
these are my three stocks i want to get in the stock market yeah i call this is how i understand

19:51.600 --> 19:59.440
i call somebody who knows somebody that lives in new york and that and they will go there to buy

19:59.440 --> 20:05.360
the yahoo for me yeah and they'll say like justin wants to buy yahoo who's got yahoo who's who's

20:05.360 --> 20:11.440
hitting who's got yahoo to sell and maybe nobody wants to sell theirs and that's how stock prices

20:11.440 --> 20:19.440
go up because everybody wants to have some yahoo uh-huh and then and then oh no things have taken

20:19.440 --> 20:27.600
a downward no one wants yahoo no one wants yahoo and then it's very easy to find it because

20:27.600 --> 20:32.720
everybody's they're just dropping it on the ground like it's a racetrack i thought legitimately that

20:32.720 --> 20:37.360
the papers in their hand were the shares i thought that that was like when people talk about shares

20:37.360 --> 20:42.880
in movies they open up old boxes and they're like what this is a hundred shares of telephones or

20:42.880 --> 20:48.800
whatever right i will say how i always thought it worked okay travis please um because you see them

20:48.800 --> 20:54.320
and they're like yelling kind of up into the air like i'll take whatever i always assume there's

20:54.320 --> 20:59.520
like one person who's like writing all that down who's like slow down slow down what did you say

21:00.160 --> 21:06.320
how much did you okay i'll see if that is a bit wait what did you hold on who who said it first

21:06.320 --> 21:14.000
everybody get in line or something what if i go to stock market and i have a slip of paper and i say

21:14.000 --> 21:20.880
y'all is a hot one i'm looking for a lot of money like 500 like 500 dollars and you can get

21:21.840 --> 21:29.040
all my shares in apples and then they see the slip of paper and it says apple in big letters

21:29.040 --> 21:35.040
they're like yeah sure here's 500 and then i say thanks and i take all the bills away from them

21:35.040 --> 21:39.680
and then they look at it and it does say apple in big letters but then there's a small s at the end

21:39.680 --> 21:48.160
of it because i've just sold them shares in apples the fruit and then now i'm 500 richer and nobody

21:48.160 --> 22:01.840
eats fucking apples anymore is that legal yes yes i gotta go then uh here is another uh question

22:01.840 --> 22:08.160
for one of our beloved readers so my girlfriend goes to college and she is very into geology and

22:08.160 --> 22:16.560
rocks at her school her geology teacher tried to get her set up on a date with his nephew who was

22:16.560 --> 22:23.840
a geologist she said no thank you i have a boyfriend to which he responded is your boyfriend a geologist

22:24.400 --> 22:30.480
didn't think so brothers do i need to fear these rock experts stealing my girlfriend

22:30.480 --> 22:36.400
must i become a rock expert to keep my four-year relationship intact that's from demolished in

22:36.400 --> 22:43.760
detroit yeah yeah yeah you're gonna have to get super into rocks yeah learn about rocks and we

22:43.760 --> 22:53.360
can help you with that limestone i get bag it big gray geodes heavy small brown concrete

22:53.360 --> 23:05.440
concrete volcano rock some of the hardest rock there is salt is a bunch of delicious rocks

23:05.440 --> 23:12.400
tasty rocks melt in your mouth rock candy candy is not well rock candy yes thank you also those

23:12.400 --> 23:19.040
pebbles that kind of look it's candy that looks like fruity pebbles the rock the rock is another

23:19.040 --> 23:28.640
one rock and roll yeah the music blue dream maui wowie magnets how do they work different

23:29.840 --> 23:38.000
strains i think this helps i did yes here's the thing no one actually knows anything about rocks

23:38.000 --> 23:42.720
how would you even look into a rock so you can say anything is inside of a rock and no one knows

23:42.720 --> 23:47.520
that is such a good point travis thank you yeah so like i'm so fucking glad you said that dude

23:47.520 --> 23:52.480
because it was fucking good so like you could like take your girlfriend out on a date to like

23:52.480 --> 23:57.360
a canyon or whatever and point and be like see that that's full of dead fish or whatever and

23:57.360 --> 24:01.680
like who the fuck knows you can't see through rocks no one's got to find out what's in that

24:01.680 --> 24:06.160
rock so you can say whatever i think you gotta show up to the school and i think you gotta pick

24:06.160 --> 24:13.040
up the biggest rock they have and i think you need to take a big bite out of it and then you

24:13.040 --> 24:16.880
chew it up talk about how big and strong your hands are you chew it up and you swallow it and

24:16.880 --> 24:22.960
you look at it and be like this is the stuff you guys are into okay and then you shred on the

24:22.960 --> 24:29.920
guitar and then you leave and then go immediately to the hospital oh time is of the essence right

24:29.920 --> 24:36.880
away um that that fraggle rock flavor is such a power booth and they're gonna love it so good

24:36.880 --> 24:42.800
though it always looks so good i get really excited when i'm like down when i'm kayaking

24:42.800 --> 24:47.520
when i'm hitting the yak and i find a rock that has like a fossil in it but do you think when

24:47.520 --> 24:54.560
a geologist finds out they're like fuck this rock is ruined yeah so let's go let's walk through that

24:54.560 --> 24:59.520
step by step if you don't mind travis um just parse it we're learning a lot this time while

24:59.520 --> 25:05.520
you're hitting the yak uh-huh and you see a rock big enough i guess to stick out of the water and

25:05.520 --> 25:14.080
there's half a tyrannosaur just sort of poking out of it um you see that often well you know

25:14.080 --> 25:20.000
it's more like you you you pull your boat over you pull your yak over to the side and you skip

25:20.000 --> 25:25.520
rocks for a couple hours and maybe one in like a thousand has got like a leaf imprint on it

25:25.520 --> 25:32.480
or a little dinosaur or a little dinosaur yeah and then you think well i should hold on to this

25:32.480 --> 25:37.440
and then you don't yeah i mean what if you pull out a diamond you're like i was looking for

25:37.440 --> 25:42.000
limestone and you throw that away because you're such a fucking idiot or one time i was eating

25:42.000 --> 25:49.600
some oysters and i found a pearl and i don't know what i did with that i lost that shit that's a

25:49.600 --> 25:57.200
good story am i a good geologist one easy way to make it seem like you know more about rocks than

25:57.200 --> 26:04.000
you do if you're wanting to to maybe not put the time in is try to more frequently point out when

26:04.000 --> 26:13.040
something isn't a rock oh you're walking down the street you see um a fire hydrant or grass

26:13.920 --> 26:24.960
yeah maybe a big rock oh no okay don't do it to rocks don't do it to rocks no wait is the

26:24.960 --> 26:31.200
statue a rock good question travis statue of liberty big green rock yes or no who knows

26:31.920 --> 26:38.000
now that one's metal i do know that one but what about like you know that david statue that's made

26:38.000 --> 26:45.040
a rock is that a rock oh all right they gotta come up with a better name for that david statue

26:45.040 --> 26:51.680
by the way i know right what about that 70s show you know what i mean just name it something even

26:51.680 --> 26:58.000
if it's like david presented by pens oil or something yeah it's like just give me some

26:58.000 --> 27:04.400
kind of name for it what about what about dave's real proud of his dick dave's wiener

27:04.400 --> 27:14.640
peep peep dave's ween don't cover up dave's ween fucking peep it peep this way keep your fig leaf

27:14.640 --> 27:21.840
which is not a rock in case you're curious what if you had a dog made of rocks is that a rock or

27:21.840 --> 27:28.560
is it a dog oh god that's a good question i'm just saying geology's hard i respect you geologists

27:28.560 --> 27:33.760
we're finally getting into some smart stuff which i've obviously been wanting for a long time

27:33.760 --> 27:39.840
it's so nice to give us some science on this one y'all let's get into this when when michelangelo

27:39.840 --> 27:45.600
was carving the statue of david uh-huh probably took a long time right right like probably several

27:45.600 --> 27:52.880
weeks most of that's been on the ween well that's the question okay okay he finishes arm torso head

27:52.880 --> 27:59.200
hair face legs did he save the ween for last i'm not saying he was like grossed out by it but did

27:59.200 --> 28:04.880
he know like his friend leonardo was talking to him like what's what do you got going on tomorrow

28:04.880 --> 28:09.920
did he have even the thought of like well tomorrow's tomorrow's the weener day like he had

28:09.920 --> 28:15.440
to have some sort of was it in his google calendar like or did he just do it and it you know

28:15.440 --> 28:19.760
perish the thought not a second thought about it or he had to at least for a second be like this is

28:19.760 --> 28:24.640
the thing that people are gonna be arguing about for a while i really gotta nail this dingus i'm

28:24.640 --> 28:30.000
gonna bring one actual fact into this discussion and then we can go from there i know david

28:30.000 --> 28:35.440
david according to google according to a quick google took two years working constantly

28:36.240 --> 28:42.480
jesus get better jackhammer dude hey dude you're working really hard on this just to make it out

28:42.480 --> 28:48.400
of cheese did you lick did you lick it and erode it with your spit what's your deal michelangelo

28:48.400 --> 28:54.800
realistically it took two years to make was there a weener month

28:54.800 --> 29:02.240
one i'm saying how long do you think he spent on the was there a whole month where he's they're

29:02.240 --> 29:08.560
like come to dinner and like i can't i have to keep working i wish i could i wish i could but

29:08.560 --> 29:14.000
i want to make this penis look very good tell you what you come over you stare at this penis

29:14.000 --> 29:19.760
if you think it looks done then i'll come to dinner but otherwise let me go back to the lab

29:19.760 --> 29:28.400
and let me keep getting this penis with a tiny chisel and the bush and the and the bush too like

29:28.400 --> 29:34.400
he had to how do you the rest of it i get i want this torso to look fucking cut and it is ripped

29:34.400 --> 29:40.160
awesome nips perfect everything's great weiner i think he just did it he probably look at his own

29:40.160 --> 29:44.160
wiener just be like all right that's a wiener but the bush he had to have a moment and again

29:44.160 --> 29:49.680
i'm not stigmatizing i'm not saying he was like oh gross a bush but he had to make a judgment call

29:49.680 --> 29:55.200
at some point like he had his chisel this was probably an entire this was a week he had a week

29:55.200 --> 29:59.840
where he just kept moving his chisel up and down the pubis like where does it where do we begin

30:00.560 --> 30:08.000
i've done some quick math yeah the david statue is 17 feet tall so 17 feet what that's much larger

30:08.000 --> 30:11.840
than i how much of that though is the fucking pedestal it's standing on yeah well but it's

30:11.840 --> 30:20.320
17 feet tall divided by 24 months means that every month he crafted 0.7 so like about three

30:20.320 --> 30:26.880
quarters of a foot right so nine inches so yes i could say that just statistically speaking there

30:26.880 --> 30:34.080
was a wiener month okay so how was your september michael angelo it was it was intense do you think

30:34.080 --> 30:38.880
he had a moment after he finished the belly button and i assume that this is the way statues work

30:38.880 --> 30:43.600
where you just sort of start at the top and work your way down uh-huh do you think he had a moment

30:43.600 --> 30:49.440
after he finished the belly button where he thought i should just put shorts on this motherfucking guy

30:49.440 --> 30:55.280
i should just give this guy so much easier if i just get some fucking shorts on the do you

30:55.280 --> 31:00.800
do you think he ever had a moment when he was working on the penis and it got very challenging

31:00.800 --> 31:06.240
and irritating after like a couple weeks in where he's like i'm just gonna knock this fucking thing

31:06.240 --> 31:10.960
knock this fucking thing off and draw some shorts on this guy i'm just i can't do this right now i'm

31:10.960 --> 31:16.400
just gonna put some fucking shorts on it or maybe just like got shorts it's just like how do i get

31:16.400 --> 31:20.880
these shorts i'm just gonna buy shorts and put them on this way that's why it took two years

31:20.880 --> 31:25.680
because it only took him a year to carve it but the original version had shorts and everybody came

31:25.680 --> 31:30.720
in going i don't know about the shorts and he was like chisel those off another another possibility

31:30.720 --> 31:36.960
is that he knew the statue you wanted to make didn't want to like waste a lot of time on it

31:36.960 --> 31:44.720
so he tried to find a big rock that already had a dick on it oh so like when you whittle and you're

31:44.720 --> 31:50.480
like oh this is the perfect shape of like a bear and a log or whatever yeah this one is he looked

31:50.480 --> 31:55.680
for this was probably one of the years him wandering around probably like greece or something

31:55.680 --> 32:02.640
looking for the perfect the perfect rock right dimensions uh easy density to carve into

32:03.200 --> 32:10.160
a fully formed dick just kind of hanging off the side and now we're now that's what i call a statue

32:10.160 --> 32:14.720
and it's good that the it wasn't like it probably wasn't way out on the inside or else david the

32:14.720 --> 32:19.840
final product would be like a dude like leaning backward arching his back with his wiener stuck

32:19.840 --> 32:26.320
way out there like come at me which may be a better statue i i would like i would like someone

32:26.320 --> 32:33.680
to now carve a companion statue of goliath just kind of like hey do you need a second um i'm ready

32:33.680 --> 32:38.240
to fight you but if you wouldn't like put on shorts or whatever i don't i don't know if you're dressed

32:38.240 --> 32:49.680
for battle my man um on this same uh website uh there's a uh uh there's a fact that the david

32:50.320 --> 32:58.320
currently you can see he sits under a skylight that was designed just for him in the 19th century by

32:58.320 --> 33:04.880
amelio de febree i bet his friends never stopped hearing about that fucking window yeah i mean huh

33:04.880 --> 33:09.280
so like well it's sort of a collaboration between me and michelangelo if you think about it because

33:09.280 --> 33:16.080
like lighting is so huge in any form of art so it's like kind of our step we know amelio we know

33:16.080 --> 33:22.480
yeah it's kind of like it's kind of like you know he took it to the one yard line right and i kind

33:22.480 --> 33:28.480
of ran it ran it through with my great window so it's kind of like it was my touchdown you know

33:28.480 --> 33:35.040
if you think about it michelangelo and amelio's david is one or maybe if you want to go alphabetical

33:35.040 --> 33:40.640
amelio and michelangelo's day they're still looking for a name for this fucking thing

33:40.640 --> 33:46.400
they should call it amelio and michelangelo's david or amelio's amelio's david featuring

33:46.400 --> 33:52.240
michelangelo and pitbull because that dude is just on everything listen they don't tell everybody

33:52.240 --> 33:59.040
this but did you guys know that he just found the penis i don't know if that denigrates us

33:59.040 --> 34:05.280
so really it's amelio and god's michael and rv david with michelangelo with special guests

34:05.280 --> 34:08.320
and introducing and introducing michael

34:11.200 --> 34:11.520
um

34:14.560 --> 34:20.560
oh crap so anyway yeah learn about rocks that'll be good for your relationship uh let's take a

34:20.560 --> 34:25.120
break and go to the money i've got about 25 david dicks on my monitor right now

34:26.560 --> 34:30.720
yeah i have been staring at this picture far too long can i say beautiful statue a great

34:30.720 --> 34:35.280
it's a really good statue is the one thought that i've had seven times we've been doing this like

34:35.280 --> 34:40.720
man that was really i'm having a lot of fun here sort of dunking on people that are not here anymore

34:40.720 --> 34:45.440
to defend themselves with a great statue but it's like a very good statue it's like a really good

34:45.440 --> 34:54.400
statue it's like i don't know how you did it i'll come to art appreciation with my brother my brother

34:54.400 --> 35:01.040
me this week michelangelo's david a very good statue super detailed bush next week next week

35:01.040 --> 35:08.960

lamb came up with that's the beef and dairy network podcast find us at maximumfund.org or wherever you

41:31.120 --> 41:38.480

41:38.480 --> 41:44.320
stocks and then through this show talk about how good yahoo is to try and get it doing better and

41:44.320 --> 41:49.040
then i sell it once it's made more money because i did a good job talking about it is that okay

41:49.040 --> 41:54.720
is that a legal thing to do griffin that's not yahoo answers question that's just a scam you want

41:54.720 --> 42:00.080
to pull that's me that's that's my whole thing right now just i think is that wait i was gonna

42:00.080 --> 42:04.960
call that insider trading but you don't work at yahoo so is that outsider trading i don't know

42:04.960 --> 42:11.200
what any of that means okay is that what they got martha stewart on that's what i got martha on

42:11.200 --> 42:20.960
that was actually cocaine wait what lots and lots of cocaine um this is yahoo that was sent to us by

42:20.960 --> 42:26.400
stacy trombone which is fantastic it's from yahoo answers user question mark this website's fucking

42:26.400 --> 42:33.760
falling down around my ears asks what are some things you would tell your younger equestrian self

42:34.960 --> 42:39.680
here's my own list one just because the ponies you grew up riding were difficult it doesn't make

42:39.680 --> 42:46.480
you a horse trainer wow set your goals small stop thinking of the ability to jump in big shows when

42:46.480 --> 42:54.880
you only jump small courses at home yeah man wake up patricia don't waste money on bling think

42:54.880 --> 43:01.040
matchy matchy gear and spend your money on lessons i like that one a lot i like that one a lot no one

43:01.040 --> 43:07.520
cares how much you know shiny metal you and your horse are wearing and matching if you you know if

43:07.520 --> 43:11.840
it you know poops during a run you got to train that shit out of them pay attention when the

43:11.840 --> 43:18.400
horse acts up instead of immediately considering it to be training issues what's the problem i'm

43:18.400 --> 43:22.720
listening plan ahead whenever everything is going well be very cautious something not only can go

43:22.720 --> 43:29.440
wrong but will go wrong yes number six is a good life lesson number six you don't need a foal seven

43:29.440 --> 43:37.040
you don't need a wild horse just eight don't invest in that timeshare eight take the harsh

43:37.040 --> 43:42.160
advice other people give you and learn from it rather than crying about it patricia no matter

43:42.160 --> 43:46.960
how good you are at riding people will always be better than you and that's okay ten don't fall for

43:46.960 --> 43:51.920
the cheap prices horses sell for you will end up spending so much more time money and tears than

43:51.920 --> 43:58.800
you would if you had just bought a regular horse wait i want to hear some hundred dollars can we

43:58.800 --> 44:04.960
chill down on the tears we all have ones we want to focus on here because i want to focus on the

44:04.960 --> 44:10.160
idea that there will always be someone better at writing than you statistically that is not true

44:10.160 --> 44:17.680
there has to be someone in the world who is the best horse rider uh it's why not you um yeah it's

44:17.680 --> 44:22.640
me so i can go ahead and say like i've got another you know few decades to kick it on this world so

44:22.640 --> 44:28.320
don't even fucking try it um so you don't need a foal you don't need a wild horse don't buy a cheap

44:28.320 --> 44:33.200
horse because the rate the quote regular horse is going to cost you a bigger upfront investment

44:33.200 --> 44:38.320
but you're gonna cry way less because if you get a cheap horse you're gonna have to spend so much

44:38.320 --> 44:43.920
money fixing it up you know what i mean it's gonna be in the shop more than it's not yeah

44:43.920 --> 44:50.720
just get a new horse don't buy used um but as soon as you walk that whole you that new horse off the

44:51.360 --> 44:56.720
barn it's gonna lose a lot of value especially if you walk it off off a barn it's gonna lose

44:56.720 --> 45:03.200
a considerable amount of value and so are you i want to go back and say that i actually think well i

45:03.200 --> 45:10.320
think sea biscuit was a used horse and look at sea biscuit yeah but okay yeah sea biscuit one

45:10.320 --> 45:15.920
but that movie specifically how much fucking time money and tears did tophor have to and that may

45:15.920 --> 45:22.240
have been tophor was it tophor no it was not tophor grace no it was what's in it no i think

45:22.240 --> 45:27.280
it was spider man on that one so spider man could have gotten i think it could have been spider man

45:27.280 --> 45:32.160
right and he could have gotten a regular more wire tophor mcguire could have gotten a regular horse

45:32.720 --> 45:38.320
and then won the race way faster and not had to worry about how many tears he was gonna have to

45:38.320 --> 45:44.640
produce but would you and would you rather have one expensive horse or 10 cheap horses that's a

45:44.640 --> 45:54.320
good point did you know when that when tophor was filming the movie tophor tophor was filming the

45:54.320 --> 46:00.880
movie did you know that he that he thought was about him he was very surprised when the movie

46:00.880 --> 46:05.120
came out and it was called sea biscuit because he thought it was about a movie about a guy who was

46:05.120 --> 46:10.640
so good at riding horses that they made a movie about him you don't think he was actually very

46:10.640 --> 46:14.800
s very surprised that they would make a movie about a horse you don't think when he showed

46:14.800 --> 46:19.520
up and the horse's trailer was bigger than his that he didn't like figure that out well i mean

46:19.520 --> 46:24.160
that one you gotta chalk up to just physics oh that's right yeah yeah the horse has got to have

46:24.160 --> 46:29.440
enough room to run around so what things would you tell your younger equestrian self i think i'd

46:29.440 --> 46:36.560
start out just saying like don't just try as hard as you can to make your fingers look less like baby

46:36.560 --> 46:46.240
carrots yeah that's pretty good um i would say like hey that horse is three people in a suit

46:47.680 --> 46:53.120
i've been hurt too many times yeah i'd rather know that ahead of time and go in eyes open

46:53.120 --> 46:54.960
rather than find out after five years

46:58.000 --> 47:03.520
i mean i got one if you're this if you're this froze up i'm frozen i don't have any i'm sorry

47:03.520 --> 47:09.280
well justin we all haven't all been perfect equestrian since birth like you yeah um i was

47:09.280 --> 47:15.120
just to go back i just don't learn i just keep doing it the same way when i started you know

47:15.840 --> 47:20.160
i would go back and i would say listen i know fast and furious movies are really hot right now but

47:20.160 --> 47:25.760
don't put nos in the horse it just doesn't work like that you think you knew where to put it and

47:25.760 --> 47:30.960
i think in your defense you put it in the best if you are going to install a nos a nitrous booster

47:30.960 --> 47:35.680
system in the horse i think you probably did it about as good as you possibly could but it's just

47:35.680 --> 47:43.120
a sort of fundamentally flawed idea i okay i do have some one piece of advice don't don't get

47:43.120 --> 47:48.640
frustrated with your horse and try to put him on your back so you can show how it's done and loudly

47:48.640 --> 47:53.760
announce like let me show you how it's done and then call over friends and family to say i'm

47:53.760 --> 47:58.880
going to show this horse how it's done and then let the horse get on your back um it's not it's

47:58.880 --> 48:04.560
not going to pan out the way that you would would like it to go um i would also say to young equestria

48:04.560 --> 48:12.160
me like yes a talking horse seems like a good investment but after a while like you and the

48:12.160 --> 48:17.440
horse will grow apart and you will find his stories no longer interest you and you've heard

48:17.440 --> 48:22.960
the same stories over and over again but legally you are still required to take care of that horse

48:22.960 --> 48:30.560
yeah it's not even worth it just get a regular whispering horse that you can ignore whenever

48:30.560 --> 48:36.480
you need to listen young griffin it's so important that you don't actually choreograph a dressage

48:36.480 --> 48:42.320
routine to kid rocks um i'm gonna be a cowboy baby because the judges are gonna find it pretty

48:42.320 --> 48:48.000
distasteful and in the future you're gonna find kid rock sort of politics also pretty distasteful

48:48.000 --> 48:56.880
so that's just a heads up uh also sell your yahoo stock depending on how far along ago i was i guess

48:56.880 --> 49:01.440
it's like what a decade so we said 10 years whatever however long it was sell your yahoo

49:01.440 --> 49:07.520
stock younger justin and this also applies to both equestrianism and stocks buy apples

49:07.520 --> 49:20.080
i like that joke hey thank you hey yeah can i ask you guys a question yeah is apple still also

49:20.080 --> 49:28.160
called macintosh no hold on was the company called macintosh and then they just named that

49:28.160 --> 49:33.200
would be like if mcdonald's was just like we're called burgers now we're called french fries come

49:33.200 --> 49:38.480
to us for or was the computer called the macintosh hold on the computer was called the macintosh

49:38.480 --> 49:45.120
because of the apple thing i would assume i do i i think you would assume it's called the that

49:45.120 --> 49:49.520
because you think that there was somebody when they were like we're gonna call the company apple

49:49.520 --> 49:54.480
there were people were like that's gonna get fucking confusing what do you guys sell apples

49:54.480 --> 50:00.560
do you think that when they came out there and steve was like our company's name is apple

50:00.560 --> 50:05.200
do you think there were some apple companies that were like ah fuck that's shit

50:08.240 --> 50:14.080
wait i wish fuck i wish we thought of that can you imagine we would just just why do we call

50:14.080 --> 50:19.600
ourselves sweet crunch that is not a good company name and you know i'm really glad that they did

50:19.600 --> 50:24.400
all that focus testing or else their like original desktop computer would have been called the apple

50:24.400 --> 50:29.840
granny smith and i just don't think that would have sold as well as the macintosh this is the

50:29.840 --> 50:34.720
this is the apple this is the apple sweet crunch it's the most powerful computer known to man

50:35.520 --> 50:43.360
apple red delicious i could do a fuji i think that would be a good line the fuji the apple

50:43.360 --> 50:48.240
pink lady all right how many apples is travis no name how many other apples you know don't google

50:48.240 --> 51:00.320
i'll know if you google i'll hear it nobody google i'm just and you want to know about

51:00.320 --> 51:09.040
apples the sweet edible fruit produced by the malice pumila well i know this is my brain from

51:09.040 --> 51:16.080
school we grew 84.6 million tons of apples in 2014 so when you say we you mean like the planet

51:16.080 --> 51:23.840
it no me okay a lot of work planting 84.6 million tons worth of apple trees now you're trying to

51:23.840 --> 51:30.480
sell them i got so many apples y'all i would like to be the first to apologize for this dumber than

51:30.480 --> 51:37.600
usual episode my brother my brother okay yes even for us this is a pretty dumb one yeah sure

51:37.600 --> 51:42.720
uh how about we do one more question because we had a long piss break in there and uh okay

51:42.720 --> 51:46.960
and we'll make this one real smart oh no i figured out why these are dumbest episode

51:47.520 --> 51:54.640
why because this episode 404 so it's not working it's an error code so my girlfriend goes to

51:54.640 --> 51:59.760
call it at least that was funny so my girlfriend goes to college and she is very did this one

52:02.560 --> 52:08.800
travis what what do you mean travis i he distracted with the 404 thing and then i

52:08.800 --> 52:13.920
forward the link to the question i have a i real quick this one's sent in by merit palmer

52:13.920 --> 52:19.040
thank you merit it's an anonymous yahoo answers user so i'll call him dougie asks

52:20.080 --> 52:26.720
has the human body evolved for fist fighting a lot of people sent this one in is the human

52:26.720 --> 52:33.120
body designed by evolution for fist fighting let me think let me pose

52:33.120 --> 52:42.720
uh yeah well that's pretty your body has some smooth action i've never done a fist fight so i

52:42.720 --> 52:50.080
can't really be a voice of authority about this um but my gut said my gut says yes i think we

52:50.080 --> 52:53.680
probably either we had different priorities throughout the ages one was just sort of hiding

52:53.680 --> 52:57.280
and survival and then using rudimentary tools and then we kind of peaked and then it was like

52:57.280 --> 53:03.040
like i don't know fist fighting it would be pretty cool to be very good at and so our

53:03.040 --> 53:09.440
fists got bigger arm got stronger bodies got better at taking the fist punches um i don't

53:09.440 --> 53:14.640
know my i'm a beautiful machine of fury and violence well that's when i look at my body

53:14.640 --> 53:17.360
i'm looking at my body for the first time just thinking i'm a beautiful machine of fury and

53:17.360 --> 53:24.560
violence i didn't know it until this moment i'm thinking about how every every piece of my body

53:24.560 --> 53:30.400
is designed to be better at fist fighting yeah so break it down bite bite for bite for me well i

53:30.400 --> 53:38.080
have the beard which protects my jaw yeah it's like natural armor um my glasses which of course

53:38.080 --> 53:43.200
grow out of my face that protect my eyes well your eyes got bad and that was evolution's way

53:43.200 --> 53:48.240
of saying you need some sort of covering on here for people with you know sharper knuckles yeah and

53:48.240 --> 53:54.000
then i turned 22 and started packing on the lbs to protect my guts yeah you know what i mean so i

53:54.000 --> 53:57.040
got a little extra padding there so if someone tries to punch you in the guts they're like oh

53:57.040 --> 54:01.040
i can't even get through it and i remember that travis on your 22nd birthday we got in a fist

54:01.040 --> 54:07.040
fight and i beat the snot out of you dude yeah and you said i'm making the decision today to

54:07.600 --> 54:14.560
you know add some add some some padding and i did and he did also my fists are three feet wide

54:15.680 --> 54:21.920
travis just got the ever long hands he's got ever long hands in this one i've got ed for long hands

54:21.920 --> 54:27.840
and so they let me punch better and punch like six people at a time it's tough to know this

54:27.840 --> 54:32.640
personally right because that's not how evolution works you don't you don't use a leaf stone on

54:32.640 --> 54:38.880
yourself and then turn into venus or it's like you can't see that but um i have a son now and

54:38.880 --> 54:45.040
when i look at his beautiful fists all i can think is wow we're really moving in that direction huh

54:45.840 --> 54:49.360
we're really moving in sort of a fist fight and i don't want my son to ever get in a fist fight

54:49.360 --> 54:56.960
but i know that his body because of evolution how it works is gonna be just crazy and wild in the

54:56.960 --> 55:04.880
in the ring or the you know wherever it is he has to fight with his fists do you think glass joe from

55:04.880 --> 55:11.040
punch out was like the last evolutionary link we had to that line of humanity like he was the last

55:11.040 --> 55:15.280
one and you just punched him out because we evolved past it obviously i haven't seen anybody

55:15.280 --> 55:21.200
with his particular malady you're right yeah it's kind of like the evolution of man of like seeing

55:21.200 --> 55:27.920
the monkey turn into the person which is like science is still out on that one it's a fun it's

55:27.920 --> 55:32.640
a fun theory but uh still waiting to hear back on that one but you can sort of follow the same

55:32.640 --> 55:39.040
trajectory going from glass joe to king hippo you see king hippo and you're like perfect specimen

55:39.040 --> 55:47.040
king hippo punching of punching his body his body can do nothing else he leaves the ring after

55:47.040 --> 55:52.000
punching so good because his body's been perfectly tuned for that purpose and he walks out of the

55:52.000 --> 55:57.440
ring and like tries to open a door and can't because his body just so he punches it right

55:57.440 --> 56:02.800
open and of course that works and you know punches spaghetti into his mouth you know i've never seen

56:02.800 --> 56:09.360
the wrestler but this is what i assume the wrestler is like yeah it's mickey roark v king hippo from

56:09.360 --> 56:15.120
uh punch out and it's just like mickey roark wrestling food into his face to where we're

56:15.120 --> 56:18.960
starting a new podcast about us guessing what's in the wrestler it's called we'll get it right next

56:18.960 --> 56:27.280
year and it's about us guessing about that it's called i'll get it right next year too the sequel

56:27.280 --> 56:32.960
to the podcast that paid us to advertise them i'm gonna google real king hippo because i need to know

56:32.960 --> 56:40.560
if king hippo but real king hippo versus prince mustern is the thing about king hippo what

56:40.560 --> 56:47.120
evolution told us is like your instinct would be the perfect puncher would have

56:48.560 --> 56:54.240
few places to punch but what king hippo does it's his he says there's many places to punch

56:54.240 --> 56:58.080
so that he can take more of them you know what i mean if you think about like you have more body

56:58.080 --> 57:05.280
mass so it's like there's more space for you to store punches yeah probably probably king hippo

57:06.240 --> 57:10.880
is god played god played a joke on him well one problem juiced and that is his huge weak point

57:10.880 --> 57:15.600
designated by an x-shaped bandage that he has over his belly button and i guess that's because his

57:15.600 --> 57:21.600
body got so crazy that and so perfect for fighting and so crazy that he needed something to hold

57:21.600 --> 57:27.680
his you know punching guts in and that is this bandage and it got hippo did you not even think

57:27.680 --> 57:33.440
about making it like flesh colored at least or just not an x shape yeah you could have made it

57:33.440 --> 57:39.760
any shape power in that shit like 45 degrees you got a plus sign if he just hiked his pants up

57:39.760 --> 57:44.320
nobody would have any fucking clue what to do with him just pull your pants up king hippo

57:44.320 --> 57:51.040
