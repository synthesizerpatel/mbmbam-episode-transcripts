WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.320 --> 00:50.320
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:56.060
It's better it's better with you

01:00.300 --> 01:02.300
Better it's better

01:10.820 --> 01:12.780
Hello and welcome

01:12.780 --> 01:18.700
My brother my brother and me and advice show for the modern era. I am your oldest brother

01:19.140 --> 01:24.620
Justin McElroy, and I am Archduke Travis McElroy Lord of the Manor

01:28.940 --> 01:34.060
What's that that's fancy man, that's fancy man God. Oh, you know what we need

01:34.780 --> 01:40.460
I can fancy take flight. We need to hire a Herald for the year to announce for us

01:40.460 --> 01:44.060
Yes, I've advocated for this a long time on this show

01:44.580 --> 01:49.420
Yeah, get yourself a personal Herald and I think that this is the time for it

01:49.420 --> 01:54.080
In old-timey art and stuff when they did show like a Herald or town crier

01:54.260 --> 02:01.540
Yeah, I always thought that my man had a horn, but I do believe it was some sort of proto Vuvuzela

02:02.260 --> 02:04.260
Like some you know what? I mean?

02:04.300 --> 02:07.420
Come and whip it over his head and be like check out the Prince

02:07.420 --> 02:10.060
or something or well

02:10.060 --> 02:15.140
No, if the Prince is already there than the town Herald suck shit at his job

02:15.140 --> 02:20.880
You got to let you got to give me fair warning so I can get my kids dressed up and in their finery

02:21.260 --> 02:24.540
And get him outside to greet the Prince and all that stuff

02:24.540 --> 02:27.080
but I'm just saying if he came out in the middle of town was like

02:29.020 --> 02:34.420
That good Vuvuzela sound I would stop what I was doing chopping chopping lumber. Yeah

02:34.420 --> 02:36.420
I mean potatoes

02:37.580 --> 02:42.540
Right, and yeah exactly can I say such a fucking good like

02:43.580 --> 02:45.580
17th century agrarian

02:46.020 --> 02:48.540
Like I mean you have the Constitution for it

02:49.220 --> 02:54.220
You got the build you have the sinew the sinew the muscle the musculature

02:54.220 --> 03:00.420
If I would be so bold of the iron stomach that can eat basically uncooked meat. It would be so dope

03:00.420 --> 03:08.020
I think I'd be really good at collecting barleys to give to the kid to give to the king and the

03:08.180 --> 03:11.680
Satisfaction I would get out of that Mike's family wouldn't have any of the barley dick

03:11.680 --> 03:18.200
But I would know like I bet the Kings eating good today. Yeah, I would love that actually probably not make it through the week

03:18.460 --> 03:24.120
Griffin if you're ever if you ever see a portal yeah, and you step through and you look around you don't see any cars

03:24.500 --> 03:27.740
Yeah, you should just start funeral planning them. Yeah

03:27.740 --> 03:29.260
I mean

03:29.260 --> 03:34.660
Come back through the portal if you can come back to the world we can but if not like start your funeral plan

03:34.660 --> 03:38.700
They don't have a modium back then yeah, and like that would be my number one concern

03:39.020 --> 03:41.020
They don't have like white noise machines

03:41.020 --> 03:45.700
They're obviously I would love it if Griffin was the one who got sucked through the portal and hello from the magic tavern

03:45.980 --> 03:47.980
the portal behind the Burger King

03:48.660 --> 03:54.460
Because it would literally just be like an afternoon of him like tripping over a log falling to a sharp rock

03:54.460 --> 03:56.460
And dying

03:56.860 --> 04:02.980
There's a chance that like the denizens of this world would see him and be like look at that pasty skin in his noodly arms

04:02.980 --> 04:04.980
He must be royalty. Yeah

04:05.980 --> 04:08.780
That young that young waifers never worked a day in his life

04:10.020 --> 04:12.340
be smirched by consumption I

04:13.020 --> 04:18.180
Have a 21st century immune system. They have nothing that could take me down. That's the first thing second

04:18.180 --> 04:23.860
Even if I did get sort of

04:24.540 --> 04:27.020
diarrhea so bad that it sort of became my

04:27.780 --> 04:33.540
Sort of defining characteristic if I knew that I would as long as I'm getting that barley to my great king

04:33.740 --> 04:35.740
yeah, and I knew that like he was

04:36.140 --> 04:42.780
Stuffed to the gills with this good stuff, and I think I could I think I would be okay with it now

04:42.780 --> 04:44.780
Here's what I will say Griffin if you were able to survive

04:44.780 --> 04:49.780
The everything I could see you being the wise barley farmer

04:49.900 --> 04:55.940
That delivers the barley in such a way that the king is like I'm gonna elevate you like you you not only deliver the body

04:55.940 --> 05:01.340
He wouldn't he'd be like that barley is my fucking life. Yeah, I live for this

05:01.660 --> 05:06.220
But the other I would elevate you but then I'm worried that that would affect the barley supply chain

05:06.220 --> 05:09.340
And so like I want you to know yes that in my heart

05:09.340 --> 05:13.980
I've elevated you but also if you don't deliver this fucking barley on a regular schedule

05:13.980 --> 05:21.140
I'll have your literal heads Baren Harkin and left Griffin with the worst barley collecting equipment just to sabotage him

05:21.140 --> 05:25.860
It was but then Griffin was able to do it. He tied two donkeys together, and they got all the barley

05:26.100 --> 05:30.460
I'm just saying when all the other serfs begin their uprising

05:30.460 --> 05:35.520
Yeah, like why does the king keep taking literally a hundred percent of our barley?

05:36.180 --> 05:39.340
Come on Griffin. Let's fucking ride. I would be like

05:39.340 --> 05:45.660
Uh, y'all go y'all go on ahead. I will I will definitely catch up on this uprising

05:46.100 --> 05:51.180
Catch me on the next uprising for sure. I just got to place a quick phone call to

05:51.740 --> 05:57.140
My leash this is this is a good point Griffin because it's just occurred to me that like in that way

05:57.140 --> 05:59.140
I actually think you might survive better

05:59.420 --> 06:05.540
Yeah, I think if I went back to the portal and the other serfs are like the king keeps taking all of our barley

06:05.540 --> 06:11.260
I bet yeah, there's barley any left for us. They would just murder me. I think they'd be like hey

06:11.260 --> 06:16.060
We're real sick of whatever this thing is that you're doing where some words sound like other words

06:16.220 --> 06:19.260
So we're gonna just go ahead and kill you and there's no

06:20.540 --> 06:26.140
Forensics or cops or an amazing bifurcation of the timeline is the first person to do a pun

06:26.140 --> 06:31.060
Yeah, everyone's like kill him kill the way. Yeah. Yeah, enjoy him

06:31.060 --> 06:35.300
And then there's only the devil could figure out that some words sound like other words

06:35.300 --> 06:36.000
It's fine though

06:36.000 --> 06:40.360
Cuz if at any point if other denizens of the fiefdom ever did get p.o'd at me

06:40.360 --> 06:43.440
I just pull out my cell phone and be like y'all should not actually

06:44.060 --> 06:50.460
Check out my fucking light rectangle idiots now step back. Let me harvest my barley and give it to my dad

06:50.460 --> 06:55.380
I mean the king oops I do that. Oh, that's so oh man. It's embarrassing me

06:56.400 --> 06:58.400
So this is an advice show

06:58.400 --> 07:03.900
Well, you're gonna take your questions that you asked us and we're gonna turn them alchemy like into wisdom. I

07:04.660 --> 07:08.980
Have a slight fever and I'm but I'm not this isn't a question

07:08.980 --> 07:14.820
I know sometimes covered free Justin slips into a question and it's hard to tell like is that Justin is that question?

07:14.820 --> 07:17.420
This is Justin. That's your internal

07:18.180 --> 07:24.540
Joke combustion engine. I don't want people to be like everyone's looking for us to slip even for a second

07:24.540 --> 07:29.060
But yeah, I mean they all come in for the crown. Everyone's come for the crowd. They're waiting for us

07:29.060 --> 07:35.060
Not me to have Griffin Griffin. I think who's got the crown on now is great

07:35.060 --> 07:39.460
And I will I will definitely send them all of my all my crop this year. I

07:41.580 --> 07:45.800
Work it. Oh, sorry. I'm this of the first question. Give me that first question Justin

07:46.860 --> 07:53.340
How can I be more like Captain Jack Sparrow? That's from Maritime, Massachusetts

07:53.340 --> 07:55.340
Waiting for an answer

07:56.460 --> 08:03.700
Can I ask why you'd why this is something? Yeah. Well, it's so rare that a question comes along that I'm like, oh

08:04.140 --> 08:08.540
That's not what we're asking at your internal machinations. We've given up on a long time ago

08:08.540 --> 08:12.700
Oh great. Well Griffin and I are asking I think I don't want to put words in your mouth there Griff

08:12.700 --> 08:15.340
But why would you want to be more like Captain Jack Sparrow?

08:15.340 --> 08:20.260
well, that's you're not putting words in my mouth you're taking the words from my mouth because those are the words that escape my mouth just

08:20.260 --> 08:24.620
Just Captain Jack Sparrow is a lovable rogue. Okay

08:24.660 --> 08:29.780
well and and one of the greatest pirates that one guy's ever seen and

08:30.420 --> 08:32.580
He's super clever. He gets out of scrapes

08:33.500 --> 08:37.800
He is a real out-of-the-box out-of-the-box problem-solver

08:39.060 --> 08:43.420
And you know, he has his own ship. He makes his own rules. Yeah

08:43.700 --> 08:47.380
He seems more or less like a pretty cool dude to me you guys

08:47.380 --> 08:50.940
Let me just for just for folks who maybe haven't seen these films. I'll

08:51.740 --> 08:57.940
I'll summarize them real quick. Yeah, there's Captain Jack Sparrow. There's his dad Barbosa. Who's also a

08:58.820 --> 09:04.580
Yeah, there's Barbacoa. There's squid face monster captain and then there's like

09:05.340 --> 09:10.100
Stuck up naval general guy sure and they all take turns sort of trading sides

09:10.380 --> 09:14.620
So but at every point throughout the 19 films that was made in this series

09:14.620 --> 09:21.700
They just did different match-em-ups like in this one Captain Jack Sparrow and squid face are teaming up against good guy and Barbacoa

09:21.700 --> 09:23.700
And then they'll switch the next

09:24.300 --> 09:30.220
This time it's Captain Jack and and and Barbacoa and the good general against squid man

09:30.220 --> 09:35.460
And I think that's the seventh or eighth one, you know, it's kind of like wrasslin in that way. Yeah

09:36.140 --> 09:39.180
Very much so for me in W. Oh, yeah

09:39.180 --> 09:44.540
Water organization, it's fucked up in that one movie where they all were the good guy

09:44.540 --> 09:47.780
And they just kind of sailed around for a while. Nothing really happened

09:49.020 --> 09:52.380
What if none of us is a bad guy? What if we just want different things?

09:53.100 --> 09:58.180
Okay, what if all of our motivations are different and our life goals just don't like line up

09:58.220 --> 10:00.660
But we can learn to see each other's perspective

10:00.700 --> 10:06.740
yeah, and there was the one that was it was just Captain Jack Sparrow and all the other captains were gone and everybody in the

10:06.740 --> 10:11.140
Movie theater kept yelling like this soft. This means more captains. Oh

10:11.980 --> 10:16.700
Also, Orlando Bloom's becomes a captain and at the end one of us so there's five captains all sort of just switch

10:16.700 --> 10:21.140
I think he becomes undead. Yeah, if I remember correctly, it's a really cool flicks

10:22.980 --> 10:27.280
But he does take time Orlando Bloom does take time to get Kiera Knightley pregnant before

10:28.100 --> 10:31.620
He then goes away for I believe ten years at a time if I'm not

10:32.220 --> 10:35.780
Before he turns into a bone skeleton and he doesn't have any more

10:35.780 --> 10:37.780
calm

10:39.100 --> 10:43.700
Can't talk about Jack Sparrow without relating the anecdote of the freest man I ever met

10:44.420 --> 10:46.420
okay, I was in a murder mystery and

10:48.100 --> 10:53.540
We I used to do these murder mysteries at Raywood Castle all the time beautiful place they don't do anymore

10:54.460 --> 10:56.420
Mr. Denham, they used to run him retired

10:56.420 --> 11:01.300
But at the end of the day or the end of the weekend once the murders have been solved and the corpses

11:01.300 --> 11:07.340
I'm cold pile everybody burnt everybody would stand up and like introduce themselves

11:08.060 --> 11:12.520
Yeah, and there was a guy at one who was just like Jack Sparrow and I'd clocked this dude before

11:13.820 --> 11:19.900
Well, we're on land so he didn't have a captain captain captain Jack and he was like

11:20.420 --> 11:25.320
I'd clocked this guy before in this exact same captain Jack because it was like a pretty good captain Jack

11:25.320 --> 11:34.600
Yeah, and he said I realized something this weekend. I used to think that when I came here and I got dressed up like this

11:34.600 --> 11:36.600
I was putting on a costume

11:36.640 --> 11:38.640
But what I realized is

11:38.800 --> 11:46.120
This is me and what I'm wearing out there. That's the costume. Fuck. Yeah, dude. Yes, dude. Fuck

11:46.120 --> 11:49.040
Yes, live it. I'm just saying if they need a new

11:49.640 --> 11:54.800
Cap Jack he's in. Yeah, probably still right from the castle. That's so much like that

11:54.800 --> 12:00.360
How can you be more like him? Yeah, we didn't even attempt it. We just talked about him for a while. Hey, wait

12:00.360 --> 12:06.440
No, no, just if that's how can you look like him? I mean just like how can I be you say be more like?

12:07.640 --> 12:09.080
Jonathan Sparrow

12:09.080 --> 12:13.160
That's his real name. Of course, Jonathan. So fucking dirty

12:13.600 --> 12:16.280
Well yesterday I couldn't I could not do that

12:16.840 --> 12:20.560
That life cuz he's so he's so dirty

12:20.560 --> 12:27.040
He's not even just like I haven't taken a shower or bath in a while dirty like he's done things

12:27.400 --> 12:29.400
Yeah to become

12:29.600 --> 12:31.600
like more dirty

12:31.920 --> 12:38.320
It's a it's a vibe. He is doing of just like can I be the dirtiest rascal?

12:39.320 --> 12:43.800
He's a dirty rascal. I think that that is rule number one be a dirty rascal

12:43.800 --> 12:49.720
I think rule number two if you accomplish something in it like seems more difficult than it really was

12:49.720 --> 12:54.080
Say it was Turtles. That's a good one. That's a good one. Say it was Turtles

12:56.000 --> 12:59.920
Every time every time he was like sea turtles and they're like, oh fuck this dude rules

13:00.560 --> 13:07.440
I'll turn to Wikipedia it begins the characterization section with according to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio

13:07.880 --> 13:10.920
Sparrow is a trickster who uses wit and deceit Arlecchino

13:10.920 --> 13:18.960
Are we stirring up the pot is a trickster. He uses wit and deceit to attain his goals referring to in disputes verbally instead of a horse. Oh

13:19.800 --> 13:26.600
With a slightly drunken swagger and has slurred speech and flailing hand gestures. Yes. Sparrow is shrewd

13:27.420 --> 13:29.420
calculating and eccentric

13:29.720 --> 13:35.760
So that the slightly drunken swagger I think is attainable right now. Yeah, that's attainable today

13:35.760 --> 13:41.280
You don't even got to be drunk to do that man. Yeah, you just get a little little swag also

13:41.280 --> 13:44.480
He's a he's a very good swordsman. I just want it not the best

13:45.360 --> 13:47.360
hard though of like all the

13:48.280 --> 13:51.200
Character traits to try to embody like I don't you need that one

13:51.480 --> 13:56.520
Well, not at first but it fucked up that on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride

13:56.800 --> 14:01.000
they did add cap captain Jack to it, but they and he looks like

14:01.000 --> 14:05.200
Pretty pretty photorealistic I would say yeah

14:06.560 --> 14:13.960
But the other animatrons in that ride still kind of look like sort of ghoulish commedia dell'arte

14:15.440 --> 14:19.800
Masks of fear. Yeah, but then like you turn a corner and there's

14:21.200 --> 14:28.360
Photorealistic captain Jack Sparrow. He's like you have to get me out of here. Yes. Yeah, take me to the Hall of Presidents

14:28.360 --> 14:30.360
Presidents

14:30.680 --> 14:37.900
Presidents that would be great. By the way. Hey Disney if you're listening just start incorporating Jack Sparrow into other animatronic things, too

14:38.040 --> 14:40.040
like the bear jamboree and

14:40.640 --> 14:45.040
Hall of Presidents anywhere there are animatronics just have like sneaky Jack Sparrow

14:45.240 --> 14:49.320
Peeking out from like behind things and like that's out of barrels and shit. Yeah

14:50.160 --> 14:54.040
There's a quote on here, too. I just wanted to pass along it says

14:54.040 --> 15:02.080
a gentleman m'lady you will always remember this as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow and that is

15:02.240 --> 15:06.680
That's the quote that source to Jack almost escapes another sticky situation

15:07.320 --> 15:08.240
Wow, yeah

15:08.240 --> 15:12.560
that is something that I have tried in my day-to-day life if I go to the post office and

15:12.720 --> 15:19.120
There's a big line and I'm about to wait in the line and then I'm like, no, I'm not gonna wait in the line

15:19.120 --> 15:21.120
I'll loudly announce

15:21.120 --> 15:27.760
gentleman m'lady you will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Justin McElroy and they're like

15:27.760 --> 15:29.760
Where are we catching what?

15:30.320 --> 15:34.480
Better luck next time and then you'll swing out on a rope. Never me down

15:35.080 --> 15:37.900
Now here's the wing that rope is attached to nothing

15:38.200 --> 15:42.520
Justin is just always holding a rope and a saver and if he sees a situation

15:42.520 --> 15:45.480
He wants to get out of he swings the saber and just yells huzzah

15:45.480 --> 15:50.680
And then kind of walks out holding the rope up like he's swinging on it, which is not don't get me wrong

15:50.680 --> 15:53.720
It's a cool move. It works every time it plays

15:54.880 --> 15:58.320
Anyway, that was a lot of talk about Pirates of the Caribbean Travis. You're welcome

15:59.320 --> 16:01.320
It's just once a year. I need it

16:02.320 --> 16:08.040
Listen, I realize I kind of called that in really early this year and I'm gonna be fucking regretting that

16:09.400 --> 16:13.320
Give anything to talk about it. I get it I get it, but I needed it

16:13.440 --> 16:17.540
Can we push the Wizards throne and make a sweet off I brought barley?

16:17.540 --> 16:20.860
Okay, you what I brought barley. Oh

16:21.660 --> 16:27.780
Yeah, the wizard you forgot your own fucking thing from like he's allergic Travis. I didn't forget it

16:27.780 --> 16:33.580
The Wizards allergic to grains. Oh, this is actually this is nut based barley. Oh

16:34.180 --> 16:37.140
Nut barley, huh? Yeah, I made it from almonds

16:38.100 --> 16:44.060
He's not he does paleo Travis. Fuck know that. Yeah. Hey cool. This is meat nuts. I

16:44.060 --> 16:46.060
I

16:46.140 --> 16:48.900
Made almonds out of beef and then I use those

16:50.860 --> 16:56.500
These are these are delicious meat nuts, okay, so this one was sent in by

16:58.860 --> 17:00.860
Celia thank you. Celia

17:00.940 --> 17:04.180
It's a wikiHow article and it's from the wizard

17:04.700 --> 17:09.780
He wrote it and it's how to convince your parents to let you wear a thong. Thank you

17:09.780 --> 17:14.700
Well, let's just say let's just say step zero. Keep your grades up. Yeah

17:15.540 --> 17:19.420
Obviously if your grades slip there's no way that this is gonna happen

17:19.420 --> 17:24.620
yeah, that's your parents to let you wear a thong may seem like an impossible task with enough preparation and strategy your chance of

17:25.780 --> 17:27.460
convincing them strengthens

17:27.460 --> 17:32.240
Convince them with a persuasive argument that will leave them confident in your abilities. Ah, yes

17:32.780 --> 17:38.680
They know they're gonna rock that shit. That's like that's terrible. That's like to basically say like do a good job

17:38.680 --> 17:43.520
Yeah, yeah, like convince them to like, okay. Yeah wikiHow. That's why I'm here

17:43.960 --> 17:49.800
Yeah, there's a lot of cognitive dissonance in this wikiHow article and that's like compared to other wikiHow articles

17:49.800 --> 17:54.440
And so that's saying something part one prepare your argument one plan your strategy

17:55.160 --> 17:58.960
Yeah, what do you think I'm doing wikiHow? Yeah

17:59.720 --> 18:04.440
It's a combination of appealing to your parents reasonable side and appealing to their emotional side

18:04.440 --> 18:10.280
You want to hit them from both angles to show your argument is thorough. Tell them how important this is to you

18:10.800 --> 18:15.000
So like is it like a slideshow set to Sarah McLaughlin? Is that what they're talking about?

18:15.000 --> 18:21.080
So I've got the I've got the details, but also a little tug of the heartstrings there. You know what I mean?

18:21.080 --> 18:23.840
I think that's the same the songs of

18:24.320 --> 18:27.380
The angels that was lazy. Okay

18:28.000 --> 18:32.040
When you plan the tracks of the angels

18:32.040 --> 18:37.560
Rest up. It's not getting you're not I'm actually listening to you in real time

18:37.560 --> 18:41.560
So I know these are not getting more. There's not more effort going into it

18:41.560 --> 18:46.520
Well this time I was getting there because the thongs would be in the cracks of the angels. Okay, okay

18:47.000 --> 18:50.040
When you plan your strategy write down how you'll approach them reasonably

18:50.040 --> 18:52.400
What kind of things do your parents react to on a logical level?

18:53.280 --> 18:55.280
What are their weaknesses? Oh

18:56.600 --> 19:00.720
That's great because then you sit down you're looking at the paper which your dad loves all dads love the paper

19:00.720 --> 19:05.760
Yeah, you say like, oh, did you see this turns out thongs are really good for the economy

19:06.280 --> 19:14.180
Mmm, that's great. They were a real Christmas story sort of. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh and then explain in really intricate detail how thongs are

19:14.460 --> 19:15.720
undermining

19:15.720 --> 19:17.720
Cryptocurrency and I bet your dad

19:20.880 --> 19:22.880
They hate crypto

19:22.920 --> 19:27.680
Okay, yeah, they don't understand it Justin. Do your parents have a strong sense of pride?

19:27.680 --> 19:29.040
Are they quick to avoid fear?

19:29.040 --> 19:31.040
These are the kinds of things you should be thinking about that's great

19:31.040 --> 19:37.680
Because if this thong plan goes south you you will be multiple steps closer to knowing how to destroy your parents

19:38.000 --> 19:42.280
Psychologically, is there a kid in your class that your parents acknowledges the Alpha?

19:42.520 --> 19:49.480
Right because like that I might listen my kids coming home every day talk about I don't know Christina Derek

19:49.480 --> 19:55.600
I don't know Jamal somebody right and I'm like, what did they do today? Huh? Yeah, cool

19:55.600 --> 20:01.320
Oh, that's so cool, man. They did what all their parents bought them the new switch, whatever it is, right?

20:01.560 --> 20:04.600
Yeah, it's like oh, yeah, they wear a thong and I'm like what they do

20:05.120 --> 20:08.600
Okay, this next part this next part so tight. Let's just get through it

20:08.600 --> 20:14.960
Okay to know why you want to wear a thong an important part of your strategy is appealing to your parents sense of reason a well

20:14.960 --> 20:22.220
Reasoned argument includes persuasive justifications for wearing a thong write down five or six logical reasons why you would want to wear a thong Wow

20:22.220 --> 20:25.580
Yeah, let me thongs thongs don't show panty lines

20:25.620 --> 20:30.380
The main benefit of this is that it avoids attention to your butt surely your parents can get on board with that

20:30.380 --> 20:32.700
They don't want people looking at their baby's bottom

20:32.700 --> 20:38.300
No way thongs last longer since there's less fabric to wait they reshape better than regular ponies

20:38.300 --> 20:40.940
Is that true if you change shape at all?

20:40.940 --> 20:47.300
It is less likely that you will have to buy new ponies saving money and then step three thongs keep you cooler and hot temperatures

20:47.300 --> 20:50.780
They are lightweight allowing for better air flow by avoiding sweat in your ponies

20:50.780 --> 20:53.620
You will also avoid possible skin rashes or blemishes

20:54.300 --> 20:57.700
That mean that's all three reasons. I did say five or six

20:58.780 --> 21:04.620
But also, there's no fucking way thongs last longer. There's no way doesn't make sense

21:04.620 --> 21:09.480
They're a hair and friction friction pressure, but just like it's flimsy, too

21:09.480 --> 21:12.100
There's less fabric. There's less room for stitching

21:13.340 --> 21:15.180
problems I

21:15.180 --> 21:20.220
Mean that is the thing. Let me tell you I I did I dabbled in speech and debate in high school

21:20.220 --> 21:25.140
You got to have some counter points ready like what what are your parents gonna bring up?

21:25.140 --> 21:31.780
Wedgie promise is definitely one of them. Yeah, and this is where you need a counterpoint right where you're just like, yeah

21:31.780 --> 21:33.780
I wear a tight belt. Oh

21:34.300 --> 21:36.300
Interesting, no one's getting in there

21:36.460 --> 21:38.460
Wells well

21:38.860 --> 21:40.860
Samantha if you promise to just wear a tight belt

21:40.980 --> 21:46.220
Every time you're wearing these things and then every time you come downstairs in a tight belt your prints would be like, oh how responsible

21:46.220 --> 21:51.740
No good choices step three step three show them you are responsible prove to your parents

21:51.740 --> 21:55.340
You are a responsible person who makes responsible choices doing this will give your argument more credibility

21:56.340 --> 21:58.340
on a sack of flour for a while

22:00.900 --> 22:02.900
Carried around you come on, baby. Yeah

22:03.380 --> 22:06.940
Wow, she's doing a great job keeping those under pants on that

22:07.220 --> 22:10.900
Flower if you have chores or homework do them on time without being asked

22:10.900 --> 22:16.060
So you're great your grades up for sure your grades up save your money instead of spending it on frivolous things

22:16.060 --> 22:21.380
And do not stay out late or come home drunk. Well guys, I went a whole month without coming home drunk

22:21.380 --> 22:23.380
So I think yes, you're ready

22:23.780 --> 22:26.380
You're ready now for those special underwear

22:26.940 --> 22:31.460
Be prepared to pay for your thong. Yeah, like getting the alternative is like not

22:32.260 --> 22:37.380
Not going to work. Look I'm not like you asked me to now. I need a hundred dollars

22:37.380 --> 22:40.340
I do not know the best thongs. I don't want to sully myself

22:41.260 --> 22:43.420
Practice your argument in the mirror. Yeah

22:43.420 --> 22:49.380
Yeah, that's that that's something that would be cool to have somebody walk in on my butt

22:49.900 --> 22:51.900
It gets so sweaty mom

22:52.980 --> 22:55.780
What are you doing there? No, they get out

22:57.420 --> 22:59.580
Approach your parents about the conversation. Yeah

23:00.380 --> 23:02.820
Ask when they seem to be in a good way approach them

23:03.140 --> 23:06.180
He doesn't want to start screaming through the walls when they're doing

23:07.340 --> 23:12.260
Hey hypothetically if I were to ask you about thongs just hypothetically

23:12.260 --> 23:17.660
Okay, so part two convincing your parents one bring your notes with you. Awesome

23:18.660 --> 23:23.100
Fucking awesome. You can hide them in your pocket or another discreet place in your pocket is great because you can be like

23:23.100 --> 23:25.100
I need to wear a thong because uh

23:25.860 --> 23:28.620
My butt gets sweaty or doesn't get so hold on one sec

23:30.260 --> 23:32.980
It says here my butt does get sweaty

23:33.940 --> 23:35.700
broach the subject

23:35.700 --> 23:36.740
calmly

23:36.740 --> 23:41.600
Try to control the conversation as much as possible the more you're interrupted the easier it will be for you to lose your place and forget

23:41.600 --> 23:48.660
What to say, that's it. They just want to flummox you. Yeah, that's that that misdirection is like number one parenting secret

23:48.660 --> 23:52.860
That's why right off the bat you have to flummox them call them by their first names. Yeah

23:53.540 --> 23:55.060
Do you uh?

23:55.060 --> 23:58.460
Daddy, I really want this new good. You can't say daddy. You gotta say like Jonathan

23:59.180 --> 24:03.700
Jonathan well, this is what I'm imagining my children coming to me and asking for the new jitsu toy

24:03.700 --> 24:06.660
And I interrupt and say like but what is a gu jitsu?

24:06.660 --> 24:12.820
And then they're like all up in there in there then their mind labyrinth and they just can't escape it

24:13.000 --> 24:19.200
Go through your list of logical reasons the sweat. Did I mention the sweat thing and the panty lines they got to go

24:19.300 --> 24:21.300
They got to go

24:21.500 --> 24:25.900
Everyone's gonna look at my butt if I don't wear a thong is that what you want fucking weirdo nasty

24:26.180 --> 24:29.020
You're nasty for that nasty dad and a nasty mom

24:29.580 --> 24:35.840
Appeal to their emotions this one. I feel like you've given us a lot of ammunition for the logical stuff

24:35.840 --> 24:39.100
Yeah, I don't know what that what we're pulling on heartstring wise

24:40.140 --> 24:43.660
Remind them that you're growing up old enough to make decisions about how to adorn your own body

24:43.660 --> 24:47.620
Yeah, I mean that's pretty foolproof mom dad. I'm 32. Let me wear a thong

24:49.980 --> 24:52.160
Invite questions well

24:55.140 --> 24:56.980
Jonathan Alicia

24:56.980 --> 25:01.140
Thus concludes my presentation. Thank you for your time today. I really appreciate your attention

25:01.140 --> 25:05.540
There will be coffee and some snacks on your way out. Oh

25:07.400 --> 25:10.140
Let's take some questions right? Oh wait. Oh, I'm getting the light

25:11.020 --> 25:15.340
I'm sorry. That concludes my time stay tuned for the next TED talk about

25:16.420 --> 25:18.020
Macrobiology or whatever?

25:18.020 --> 25:22.640
Give them some time to talk it over or think about it. No, you can't have a thong. Well, hold up

25:23.300 --> 25:28.300
Circle back tomorrow. Thank you. Remember what I said Alicia think what does Alicia think Alicia?

25:28.300 --> 25:34.020
You guys do not seem on the same page about you know, Jonathan. You never take time to ask Alicia what she thinks

25:34.020 --> 25:36.740
Oh, I'm so sorry. You have to put this this

25:38.860 --> 25:41.760
We'll go get some wine Alicia, we don't need Jonathan for this

25:42.780 --> 25:46.820
Start part three reacting to their response be prepared for any response. Okay?

25:47.340 --> 25:50.420
Prepare yourself for the possibility. They will say no or drive the discussion out

25:50.420 --> 25:55.380
it's a good idea to come up with possible solutions to those scenarios, even if they do not happen you press the button and

25:55.380 --> 26:02.220
Jail cell bars drop over every exit from the kitchen. Yeah anywhere. I have these jail bars

26:02.700 --> 26:06.100
Installed until we're done here until I'm done with you

26:06.980 --> 26:08.500
react calmly

26:08.500 --> 26:12.940
If they respond with an immediate, no, don't storm off in a huff or raise your voice. Let me wear a thong. No

26:14.060 --> 26:15.420
Okay

26:15.420 --> 26:20.780
Cool, if you feel yourself getting upset breathe check to see if your body is tensing up and relax your body

26:20.780 --> 26:26.060
If none of that works and everyone's still glaring at each other tell a joke. Humor is a great way to defuse a tense situation

26:26.500 --> 26:28.500
That's awesome

26:28.500 --> 26:35.200
Play this play Cisco's thong song at maximum volume on every smart device in the house Alexa

26:36.540 --> 26:40.420
This this one seems like actually a very good strategy ask them why they say no

26:41.380 --> 26:47.100
Like I want to wear thongs everything in your life, huh? Yeah speak on that speak on that, please

26:47.100 --> 26:52.620
Do you think that this is something is this because your parents had no to you for something Jonathan?

26:53.420 --> 26:55.820
Jonathan, are you just projecting forth your?

26:56.620 --> 27:04.300
Your fear of not being responsible enough for a thong. I understand that I understand that you've forgotten what it's like to want things Jonathan

27:04.940 --> 27:12.100
songs Jonathan and that's that's partially my fault since I since I was was born and I understand that that's a sacrifice parents have

27:12.100 --> 27:16.100
To make but don't you don't have to force that on me. Did I mention the sweat?

27:16.100 --> 27:18.020
sweaty, but

27:18.020 --> 27:20.300
Why do you want my butt to sweat dad? Damn?

27:21.060 --> 27:23.060
I thought we were cool

27:23.060 --> 27:28.660
If your parents won't budge off of them a compromise, maybe you can suggest revisiting the topic after you show more responsibility

27:28.900 --> 27:31.900
That's probably gonna do it. It's because I didn't mop enough

27:33.100 --> 27:38.600
All right, mom dad compromise. I'll wear the thong over regular underpants. Yeah

27:39.240 --> 27:42.840
Finally step five drop the subject if all else fails accept your fate and walk away

27:42.840 --> 27:47.700
Do not continue to beg or harass your parents doing that will only diminish any chance of convincing them later and it will put them

27:47.700 --> 27:51.540
In a bad mood walking away from the argument with grace allows you to keep your parents respect, huh?

27:52.540 --> 27:56.980
Seems like you're very lost your parents respect cuz I don't respect enough to let you wear the thong you crave. Yeah. Yeah

27:57.540 --> 27:59.060
I

27:59.060 --> 28:02.420
Think also I'll add a step six on this wiki article

28:02.420 --> 28:07.580
I don't think you're allowed to just I don't think these are up for community edits, but you could also just do it

28:07.580 --> 28:13.660
Yeah, and what are they going to do? You know what I mean? You'll have to wash them yourself to not get

28:13.980 --> 28:16.460
if you really want to cloak the situation, but like

28:16.900 --> 28:20.060
They're not gonna be like hmm Samantha can't help but notice

28:20.060 --> 28:26.420
There's not as many panty lines this morning because that's a fucking wild thing to say over the over the in the breakfast nook

28:27.260 --> 28:31.500
I think that I think that these are foolproof ideas

28:31.500 --> 28:36.480
I will also say if if your parents say no instead of just walking away and accepting your fate

28:36.480 --> 28:41.180
Let me offer this say like, okay. I hear you. Let's revisit this in q3

28:42.020 --> 28:47.780
Let's circle back in q3. I think that that's gonna like knock them off their groove a little bit

28:47.780 --> 28:52.260
Yeah, so that when you bring up in q3, they're like, I think they're a business person

28:52.260 --> 28:56.620
Sometimes my kids drop something and that would be the exact moment to attack

28:56.620 --> 28:58.780
Like if they just like dropped it like all right

28:58.780 --> 29:02.760
I would be so sort of like I would need to sit down on the floor for a little bit

29:02.760 --> 29:06.440
Yeah, and that's the time where you like if you change your mind. Just let me know. Yeah

29:06.720 --> 29:09.880
Show me the exact date on this calendar where I'm gonna be a lot of ways

29:10.560 --> 29:14.500
The thing is q2 q2 is the summertime. And so my butt is gonna be

29:15.280 --> 29:21.340
Just just covered with rashes and irritation because of my stupid big underwear

29:21.340 --> 29:25.960
Yeah, to be fair Griffin that depends on your family's fiscal year starts, right? That's a fair point

29:25.960 --> 29:31.420
I mean if anything just a week after you do this conversation if it fails you sit down in the breakfast nook and you go

29:31.420 --> 29:33.220
Ah, oh

29:33.220 --> 29:34.600
Sorry guys

29:34.600 --> 29:39.700
Covered in rashes chalk a block rashes down there. Wow, it's irritated. Oh

29:40.480 --> 29:41.600
man

29:41.600 --> 29:48.240
The kids in school. They keep yelling at me every time I yell every time I sit down at the classroom desk or lunch table

29:48.240 --> 29:55.000
Yeah, and they're like, is it your visible panty lines that are giving you rashes sweaty, but are you wearing a teenage diaper?

29:55.800 --> 29:57.480
hurts

29:57.480 --> 29:59.480
teenage diaper

29:59.480 --> 30:01.480
Barber

30:10.200 --> 30:13.780
Let's take a break and go over the my zone we guys think about that. Yeah

30:13.780 --> 30:18.780
Oh

30:25.100 --> 30:29.380
Hey, can I tell you guys something absolutely wild y'all I tweeted

30:30.180 --> 30:35.220
Lou wherever you are. We need a mombo number six now more than ever and

30:35.220 --> 30:42.140

30:42.140 --> 30:45.980
Tweeted it and said sounds like a fun job for the Justice League

30:47.100 --> 30:49.100
What what the fuck?

30:49.500 --> 30:52.780
How would you say? Why would you say this when we're going into the money zone?

30:53.300 --> 30:58.100
We can talk about when we come back now. I mean, I think we're in it now. I think you've started it

30:58.100 --> 30:58.440
Yeah

30:58.440 --> 31:03.640
We can't do the ads now because we have to talk about why Linda Carter thinks a good job for the Justice League would be defined

31:03.640 --> 31:08.260
Lou Bega make him dream of a number. I mean a big thing is why this ended up on on

31:08.780 --> 31:13.840
Linda Carter's plate in the first place. Linda Carter does not follow me on Twitter. No, yeah

31:14.780 --> 31:16.940
but there's obviously some degree of

31:18.160 --> 31:22.900
separation there where like somebody retweeted it and then Linda Carter saw that and

31:23.380 --> 31:29.460
Was like, I don't know who this fucking Travis nobody is but he's got some dope thoughts about Lou Bega

31:29.660 --> 31:32.320
But what about instead of Lou Bega? It's Aquaman

31:32.320 --> 31:39.720
What if they said like the D string Justice League to go find Lou Bega that actually would be a fun idea

31:40.160 --> 31:47.120
Wonder Twins is right about go find Lou Bega. Yeah wonder twins and so the other bad ones that nobody likes red tornado, baby

31:47.120 --> 31:55.880
I think that the amount of you're you're not thinking I think logically about this because there's still so there is

31:55.880 --> 32:01.640
Uncalculable power that exists in the the the

32:02.440 --> 32:06.600
Dead Sea Mambo scrolls the Mambo apocrypha of one through four

32:06.600 --> 32:11.360
I think that if we got our hands on that that quadrilogy

32:11.520 --> 32:18.700
It would be enough to tide us over for the next few centuries. You have to do Mambo number six Clark

32:18.700 --> 32:25.680

32:30.560 --> 32:32.880
Dumped in too much trumpet. Don't you understand?

32:33.840 --> 32:35.840
It was too much

32:36.120 --> 32:41.280
He would there be a break in mama never six would be like even more trumpet and it would just be eight

32:41.280 --> 32:48.200
This cordon trumpets just all blue and would shatter. Yeah, I knew it on

32:48.640 --> 32:56.400
The Mambo number five maxi single. There are four tracks. I'm betting it was a casino, right? It would have to be. Yeah

32:57.600 --> 33:01.920
Mama number five radio edit mama number five extended mix

33:02.680 --> 33:05.840
Mambo Havana Club mix. Yeah Mambo

33:05.840 --> 33:13.680
The trumpet and that one is six minutes long. Oh god. I don't know if it's just like hey, here's something you could sample

33:13.880 --> 33:15.640
It's the trumpet

33:15.640 --> 33:21.820

Hold on to him right now. Oh, really? I'm building a lot of passive muscle. Oh

38:30.780 --> 38:33.280
Yeah background muscle is what they call it

38:36.060 --> 38:38.060
It's been so long

38:38.060 --> 38:42.940
Really? I really didn't think Justin would do this because he was sick and like but I

38:44.200 --> 38:46.200
Think that kind of shows a little bit

38:57.140 --> 39:01.700

Hi, welcome on squad. Well, thank you. It's good to be here within a push. Shut up. Oh

39:12.900 --> 39:17.020
Podcasts in a podcast which profiles the latest and greatest in brand eating

39:17.740 --> 39:21.100
rather than set up today's thing with

39:22.980 --> 39:24.780
You know

39:24.780 --> 39:26.460
spiel I

39:26.460 --> 39:32.540
Wanted to play the commercial for it first great and then talk about it. Is that okay?

39:33.580 --> 39:35.580
Now I warn you

39:35.940 --> 39:41.460
This is two minutes and 20 seconds long. Oh, man. Oh, yeah, but listen

39:41.740 --> 39:48.500
You're gonna be in such a fucking tizzy when you hear what this is this ad from the year of our Lord 2020

39:49.020 --> 39:50.660
see

39:50.660 --> 39:53.600
2022 yeah, see you're gonna trip you ready

39:53.600 --> 39:55.960
Are you ready? Yes

39:59.320 --> 40:05.640
One day the guy on the buffalo wing was riding around in a forest smell the smell

40:06.240 --> 40:10.080
He's thinking where's that smell coming from feels like maybe over there

40:11.120 --> 40:14.400
So we mosey don't over pull back on the range

40:14.400 --> 40:26.720
That's how you stop a buffalo wing and he hopped on off and he looked in the bush and he saw the wall go to glow of a buffalo garlic blaze meal from Zaxby's

40:26.720 --> 40:31.960
I'm gonna take this with me to go. It's great. Wouldn't it be good with some range?

40:31.960 --> 40:33.960
Go!

40:33.960 --> 40:35.960
Oh, thanks Eagle

40:35.960 --> 40:41.240
Oh, no, you don't ask too many questions

40:41.240 --> 40:47.080
But it's a guy on the buffalo wing

40:47.080 --> 40:49.080
Guy on the buffalo wing

40:49.080 --> 40:56.240
One day the guy on the buffalo wing saw a fox in the weeds. He's thinking that fox seems shady

40:56.840 --> 41:00.280
No, he's probably harmless enough. I'll just let him go. See you little fella

41:00.440 --> 41:06.320
And then he found a hedgehog jammed down in a log and pulled him out and they became best friends

41:06.320 --> 41:14.320
They went back to the buffalo wing to snack down on Zaxby's, but the food was gone. The stinking fox stole our meals

41:14.320 --> 41:21.320
Oh, but you know what? I got an idea says the hedgehog. I got something stashed in an old stump

41:21.320 --> 41:28.320
Oh, that's a buffalo garlic blaze meal. That's what I was just eating. Oh, it's tantalizing. Let's sit down and eat it

41:28.320 --> 41:30.320
Mmm, that's pretty good

41:30.320 --> 41:33.320
Guy on the buffalo wing

41:33.320 --> 41:36.320
Well, if it isn't the chicken wing thief

41:36.320 --> 41:41.320
Sorry, man. I'm a fox. It's kind of my thing. Truce? Come here, man. We're cool

41:41.320 --> 41:46.320
Oh, it's a guy on the buffalo wing

41:52.320 --> 41:55.320
Hey, uh, guy? I don't remember it happening like that

41:55.320 --> 41:56.320
Yeah, I don't either

41:56.320 --> 41:59.320
Every time he eats Zaxby's that's all he wants to talk about

41:59.320 --> 42:03.320
Yeah, I saw the original and it was definitely a buffalo you were riding not a buffalo wing

42:04.320 --> 42:06.320
Guy on the buffalo wing

42:06.320 --> 42:09.320
And then it's the original old guy from guy on the buffalo

42:09.320 --> 42:11.320
I can't believe

42:11.320 --> 42:12.320
Can you believe

42:12.320 --> 42:14.320
That guy on the buffalo wing

42:14.320 --> 42:16.320
That bones are their money

42:16.320 --> 42:18.320
There's there's been

42:19.320 --> 42:21.320
Justin I don't

42:22.320 --> 42:24.320
I don't I don't think

42:24.320 --> 42:26.320
I've been dealing with this now you got to deal with it

42:26.320 --> 42:30.320
Well, I'm mostly dealing with the fact that it now it's on our show now. It's on our show

42:30.320 --> 42:34.320
So now it's on other problems. There's no fucking way

42:34.320 --> 42:35.320
Uh-huh

42:35.320 --> 42:40.320
That I would say more than 30% of our audience understands the reference

42:40.320 --> 42:42.320
That's okay

42:42.320 --> 42:43.320
Wait, there's a reference?

42:43.320 --> 42:44.320
You're probably

42:44.320 --> 42:45.320
Travis?

42:45.320 --> 42:46.320
Travis, are you fucking with me?

42:46.320 --> 42:49.320
I am not fucking with you at all. I have no idea what this was

42:49.320 --> 42:51.320
Okay, stop the show

42:51.320 --> 42:52.320
Okay

42:52.320 --> 42:53.320
This is what I'm saying, Justin

42:53.320 --> 42:58.320
It's it's this is okay Griffin. You're actually your math was right. I got a 30%

42:58.320 --> 43:01.320
I guess 66.6 repeating

43:01.320 --> 43:05.320
But that's not a good hit rate. I think okay. So okay back in 2011

43:05.320 --> 43:09.320
There was a series of YouTube videos called guy on a buffalo that took

43:09.320 --> 43:13.320
Clips from an old show from the 70s. I think called Buffalo Jones

43:13.320 --> 43:17.320
Of just a guy riding around on a buffalo and

43:17.320 --> 43:20.320
Mainly just fighting off animals that try to get at him

43:20.320 --> 43:25.320
Okay, but now they've said but now Zaxby's has taken that 11 year old meme

43:25.320 --> 43:30.320
And well, you know, I don't know Justin got fucking berries and cream started again

43:30.320 --> 43:32.320
So I guess anything's possible

43:32.320 --> 43:34.320
I guess anything is definitely possible

43:34.320 --> 43:37.320
Damn Zaxby's that's a deep fucking cut

43:37.320 --> 43:43.320
It's like a 30% of our audience and approximately 0.03

43:43.320 --> 43:46.320
Repeating percent of the TV watching audience

43:46.320 --> 43:47.320
Yeah

43:47.320 --> 43:53.320
So Zaxby's launched an ad campaign to introduce its Buffalo Garlic Blaze signature sauce

43:53.320 --> 43:58.320
The new campaign features the quirky guy on a buffalo wing national spot

43:58.320 --> 44:05.320
Which premiered during Monday's college football playoff and will run during the big game

44:05.320 --> 44:11.320
On February 13th. Oh, they're still doing that. Yeah, they're still going for it

44:11.320 --> 44:15.320
The pandemic numbers are so bad. Are you sure they're not going to cancel it?

44:15.320 --> 44:17.320
They're definitely going to cancel it

44:17.320 --> 44:19.320
They're going to zoom. They're going to zoom it

44:19.320 --> 44:22.320
Now I'm tackling you. Hey, I tackled that guy

44:22.320 --> 44:28.320
Oh my god, can I just say like a bunch of like iPads on robotic like bases fucking watch the shit out of that

44:28.320 --> 44:30.320
Sounds better than football, no concussions

44:30.320 --> 44:31.320
Yeah

44:31.320 --> 44:33.320
It's just a bunch of like tricked out robots getting wild

44:33.320 --> 44:37.320
You do have to be careful dumping the Gatorade because you're going to ruin a lot of technology that way

44:37.320 --> 44:41.320
Yeah, tens of thousands of dollars. All these segues are ruined

44:41.320 --> 44:47.320
It's just, it's just, it's just, it's not, it's just wild y'all

44:47.320 --> 44:56.320
It would be like if fucking, I don't know, Cheerios were like all your Cheerios are belong to us

44:56.320 --> 45:03.320
The new guy on a buffalo wing commercial follows a lone cowboy riding a Zaxby's style buffalo wing

45:03.320 --> 45:09.320
Who discovers a boneless wings meal from Zaxby's that features the new Buffalo Garlic Blaze sauce

45:09.320 --> 45:12.320
The spot is narrated to a folk song

45:12.320 --> 45:15.320
Pretty sure that's not how that works dramatically

45:15.320 --> 45:18.320
Composed by the band Jomo and the Possum Posse

45:18.320 --> 45:24.320
Featuring quirky characters such as the Bobcat, the Squirrel, the Fox, and the Hedgehog

45:24.320 --> 45:27.320
Why are you describing it like this?

45:27.320 --> 45:29.320
I mean, that's what it is, Trav. I don't know what you want

45:29.320 --> 45:37.320
I know, but it's not like, it's just saying the parts of it without like explaining it at all

45:37.320 --> 45:38.320
Yeah

45:38.320 --> 45:41.320
It's like, yeah, this is what happens in it. Okay, but like why?

45:41.320 --> 45:43.320
Why is that what happens in it?

45:43.320 --> 45:50.320
He says with Dooley Tombras, the president of Zaxby's creative agency of record, Tombras

45:50.320 --> 45:55.320
Says, guy on a buffalo wing is impossible to look away from

45:55.320 --> 45:59.320
The kind of campaign that will make diners wonder what they're missing

45:59.320 --> 46:01.320
And have to try it for themselves

46:01.320 --> 46:05.320
Do you guys think that the mindset of, but you're talking about it

46:05.320 --> 46:10.320
Has gone too fucking far in this year of Our Lord of 2022

46:10.320 --> 46:12.320
Where people are like, yeah, but you're talking about like, yeah, but

46:12.320 --> 46:16.320
Ask me in 10 minutes what the food was

46:16.320 --> 46:17.320
Yeah

46:17.320 --> 46:20.320
I couldn't tell you, but I'll talk about this wild video forever

46:20.320 --> 46:24.320
The last time that worked is when they fucking murdered Mr. Peanut

46:24.320 --> 46:29.320
And I was like, I can't look away from that ad because my good friend Mr. Peanut has passed away

46:29.320 --> 46:30.320
And I thought about it

46:30.320 --> 46:34.320
No, but even then made me not want to eat peanuts because I felt like I was eating his corpse

46:34.320 --> 46:39.320
Or I'd much rather feel like I was eating alive Mr. Peanut over and over again and killing him myself

46:39.320 --> 46:46.320
I would say, Travis, once you see this man riding a buffalo wing

46:46.320 --> 46:49.320
You will not soon forget what this is about

46:49.320 --> 46:54.320
There's several shots where he is eating a plate of boneless garlic wings

46:54.320 --> 46:57.320
Buffalo garlic blaze boneless wings

46:57.320 --> 47:02.320
On a plate that is on top of his steed

47:02.320 --> 47:03.320
Yeah, fucked up

47:03.320 --> 47:06.320
Which is itself a buffalo, a giant buffalo wing

47:06.320 --> 47:08.320
But is it a boneless wing he's riding?

47:08.320 --> 47:10.320
That is up for interpretation

47:10.320 --> 47:11.320
I don't believe so

47:11.320 --> 47:13.320
It looks like it does have a bone in it

47:13.320 --> 47:14.320
Okay

47:14.320 --> 47:16.320
It's just, there's so many things

47:16.320 --> 47:20.320
One, the big buffalo wing does look like I would fuck that up in a major way

47:20.320 --> 47:22.320
Yeah, but then you wouldn't have anything to ride on

47:22.320 --> 47:25.320
But I wouldn't want to sit astride a buffalo wing in the first place

47:25.320 --> 47:31.320
Because some of my top five places that I don't want to get buffalo sauce on

47:31.320 --> 47:33.320
My Goojer is way up there

47:33.320 --> 47:37.320
Especially if you've been riding that saddle all day and you're getting a little chafed

47:37.320 --> 47:39.320
Because your parents wouldn't let you buy a thong

47:39.320 --> 47:42.320
And then you're sitting there and it's just seeping through your slacks

47:42.320 --> 47:44.320
Forget about it, my man

47:44.320 --> 47:45.320
Forget about it, dude

47:45.320 --> 47:49.320
I don't want a spicy Goojer in the middle of the forest

47:49.320 --> 47:52.320
Where am I going to go? What am I going to do about it?

47:52.320 --> 47:55.320
Don't get me started on ants

47:55.320 --> 48:05.320
If this kicks off a trend of doing parodies of ancient, like ancient, ancient memes

48:05.320 --> 48:07.320
I would actually be super into that

48:07.320 --> 48:09.320
I would actually like that quite a bit

48:09.320 --> 48:12.320
You can have any meal you want at Combo.com

48:12.320 --> 48:14.320
Oh, that's good

48:14.320 --> 48:20.320
They could be like, burger, burger, burger, burger, mushroom, mushroom

48:20.320 --> 48:23.320
Yeah, that was me, Star Wars kid

48:23.320 --> 48:30.320
My male pattern baldness has made me into more of a Star Wars man

48:30.320 --> 48:32.320
Oh, man

48:32.320 --> 48:33.320
Oh, boy

48:33.320 --> 48:34.320
Boy, howdy

48:34.320 --> 48:35.320
All right

48:35.320 --> 48:38.320
All right, so that's much one

48:38.320 --> 48:40.320
Give me the next question, Justin

48:40.320 --> 48:41.320
You got it, bud

48:41.320 --> 48:42.320
I work at a hospital

48:42.320 --> 48:43.320
Thank you for your service

48:43.320 --> 48:47.320
And on the patient food trays, they have milk cartons with little jokes

48:47.320 --> 48:48.320
Awesome

48:48.320 --> 48:49.320
One of the jokes

48:49.320 --> 48:52.320
I read one of the jokes to my coworker smiling excitedly

48:52.320 --> 48:55.320
Only for him to nod and politely stare at me

48:55.320 --> 48:57.320
The joke

48:57.320 --> 49:00.320
What happens when a cow doesn't shave?

49:00.320 --> 49:04.320
She grows a mustache

49:04.320 --> 49:06.320
I feel like I'm in a tomb right now

49:06.320 --> 49:08.320
Brothers, was there a problem with my delivery?

49:08.320 --> 49:09.320
Yes

49:09.320 --> 49:10.320
Couldn't matter

49:10.320 --> 49:11.320
Unanswerable

49:11.320 --> 49:13.320
Can I show my face again at work after this?

49:13.320 --> 49:17.320
And most importantly, how do I up my milk-based joke game?

49:17.320 --> 49:20.320
That's from Cowardly Comic in Greenville

49:20.320 --> 49:27.320
I figured with this one, we're three professional top-tier comedians

49:27.320 --> 49:32.320
And I figured that we could maybe do, I don't know, some punch-ups, some coaching here

49:32.320 --> 49:43.320
Justin, I do like, whether intentional or not, how absolutely flat and soulless you deliver that joke

49:43.320 --> 49:47.320
So that we have just solid flat ground to build off of

49:47.320 --> 49:50.320
Yeah, that was about as worse as anybody could deliver that joke

49:50.320 --> 49:53.320
If the joke is good, it doesn't need the help

49:53.320 --> 49:54.320
It is a good joke

49:54.320 --> 49:55.320
This is a good joke

49:55.320 --> 49:57.320
Okay, you deliver it in a way that makes me laugh

49:57.320 --> 49:58.320
Hey Justin

49:58.320 --> 49:59.320
Yeah

49:59.320 --> 50:00.320
Justin

50:00.320 --> 50:01.320
Yeah

50:01.320 --> 50:02.320
Justin

50:02.320 --> 50:03.320
Yeah

50:03.320 --> 50:09.320
What happens when a cow doesn't shave?

50:09.320 --> 50:12.320
What?

50:12.320 --> 50:15.320
She grows a moustache

50:15.320 --> 50:18.320
See, that wasn't funny still, and it wasted more of my time

50:18.320 --> 50:19.320
Well fuck

50:19.320 --> 50:21.320
I would hit it like this

50:21.320 --> 50:23.320
Hey Juice, why doesn't a cow shave?

50:23.320 --> 50:24.320
I don't know, why?

50:24.320 --> 50:26.320
He has a moustache

50:26.320 --> 50:29.320
It sucked still, but it was like

50:29.320 --> 50:36.320
Yeah, but you're thinking about this as people who have been free to make jokes and have fun for the last 45 minutes

50:36.320 --> 50:41.320
You're on break at a hospital where the weight of responsibility can feel crushing

50:41.320 --> 50:47.320
And now here's a brief moment of respite where you're able to goof without feeling like a monster

50:47.320 --> 50:52.320
And you deliver this like, banger moustache joke

50:52.320 --> 50:55.320
The joke sucks shit from the ground up

50:55.320 --> 51:01.320
There's no good delivery of it that's going to make this person who's dying bust up and forget about it

51:01.320 --> 51:02.320
You know what I mean?

51:02.320 --> 51:05.320
So you may as well like, I don't want to rob them of the precious life seconds they've got

51:05.320 --> 51:06.320
Hey, why doesn't a cow shave?

51:06.320 --> 51:07.320
He has a moustache

51:07.320 --> 51:11.320
That's two and a half seconds and then they're able to go do more stuff

51:11.320 --> 51:17.320
I've only seized their attention for like, a really, really minimal amount of time

51:17.320 --> 51:24.320
Is there a punch up you can do to it, Griffin, that like, take this joke and make it work?

51:24.320 --> 51:26.320
Sure, let me try

51:26.320 --> 51:29.320
Hey, what happens if a cow doesn't shave?

51:29.320 --> 51:30.320
What?

51:30.320 --> 51:31.320
What?

51:31.320 --> 51:34.320
It gets a fucking moustache, baby!

51:34.320 --> 51:36.320
That's pretty good

51:36.320 --> 51:39.320
Oh, you know what I like? I like the jokes where it seems like a rip

51:39.320 --> 51:42.320
So you can start off reading the paper, everybody loads the paper

51:42.320 --> 51:45.320
And you go like, oh, did you see this? Did you hear about this?

51:45.320 --> 51:46.320
You hear about one of these things?

51:46.320 --> 51:47.320
You hear about one of these?

51:47.320 --> 51:48.320
You hear about this now?

51:48.320 --> 51:52.320
You hear about this? It looks like this cow, ooh, their razor broke

51:52.320 --> 51:54.320
She wasn't able to shave

51:54.320 --> 51:55.320
Oh yeah, what happened?

51:55.320 --> 51:58.320
Oh, she grew a moustache

51:58.320 --> 52:00.320
That's dope. Here, let me try this

52:00.320 --> 52:02.320
They got bought into it at that point

52:02.320 --> 52:04.320
The cow didn't shave, guess what?

52:04.320 --> 52:05.320
What?

52:05.320 --> 52:07.320
It got a moustache

52:07.320 --> 52:10.320
Huh. That's a thinker

52:10.320 --> 52:14.320
Yeah, that one is good. That's a good way of doing it, actually

52:14.320 --> 52:18.320
Do you know a cow's favorite disgraced Prime Minister of Italy?

52:18.320 --> 52:20.320
Oh no, who?

52:20.320 --> 52:22.320
Mussolini

52:22.320 --> 52:26.320
That's good. I like calling Mussolini a disgraced

52:26.320 --> 52:29.320
I think that's kind of underselling it, but sure, yeah, yeah, yeah

52:29.320 --> 52:32.320
Oh, he's so embarrassed

52:32.320 --> 52:34.320
Well, he's not graced

52:34.320 --> 52:37.320
That's for damn sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

52:37.320 --> 52:40.320
He's not holding his head up high for a lot of reasons

52:40.320 --> 52:43.320
Yeah, I like that. That's pretty good

52:43.320 --> 52:46.320
Okay, oh, here's a tough one. Now it's a riddle. You ready?

52:46.320 --> 52:47.320
Okay

52:47.320 --> 52:53.320
Which of the Mario Brothers is a cow's favorite?

52:53.320 --> 52:54.320
What?

52:54.320 --> 52:58.320
Which of the Mario Brothers is a cow's favorite?

52:58.320 --> 52:59.320
Who's that?

52:59.320 --> 53:02.320
The Mario Brothers? Oh, it's two plumber bros?

53:02.320 --> 53:05.320
Obviously, I know who the Mario Brothers is because I'm an original gamer

53:05.320 --> 53:07.320
They're friends with Toad? You know Toad's friends?

53:07.320 --> 53:09.320
I don't know anything

53:09.320 --> 53:10.320
Toad!

53:10.320 --> 53:12.320
Yeah, I don't know who that is

53:12.320 --> 53:15.320
You know fucking Toad, dude? Look at my tattoo! This isn't me either

53:15.320 --> 53:16.320
This is the person telling the joke

53:16.320 --> 53:17.320
Yeah, of course, of course

53:17.320 --> 53:19.320
I love the person you've invented

53:19.320 --> 53:20.320
It's Toad's friends

53:20.320 --> 53:25.320
Who doesn't know who Mario or Luigi is, but fucking is just wild about the little pervert Toad

53:25.320 --> 53:32.320
Look at my face! I have a Toad tattoo in the corner of my eye like a teardrop, only it's Toad

53:32.320 --> 53:34.320
I got one for everybody I've killed

53:34.320 --> 53:35.320
Okay

53:35.320 --> 53:36.320
I got six of them

53:36.320 --> 53:38.320
What's the punchline?

53:38.320 --> 53:44.320
Oh, you can say either Moo-ee-gee or Moo-rio

53:44.320 --> 53:45.320
They both work

53:45.320 --> 53:46.320
That sucks

53:46.320 --> 53:48.320
You somehow wrote a worse joke

53:48.320 --> 53:52.320
What's the cow's favorite former president of the European Central Bank?

53:52.320 --> 53:54.320
There's a lot of politics here, Justin

53:54.320 --> 53:56.320
Moo-rio Draghi

53:56.320 --> 53:57.320
Now hold on

53:57.320 --> 54:00.320
Well, you did just kind of use Moo-rio again

54:00.320 --> 54:02.320
Yeah, but mine was like you didn't see

54:02.320 --> 54:08.320
Travis, okay, I don't want to be like, whatever Travis, but you can't have the punchline part in the setup

54:08.320 --> 54:12.320
Okay, where does a cow go to learn about art and history?

54:12.320 --> 54:13.320
The museum

54:13.320 --> 54:14.320
Exactly

54:14.320 --> 54:15.320
That sucks

54:15.320 --> 54:17.320
Do it different

54:17.320 --> 54:28.320
I just want to remind the two of you on this call that we can't just deliver purposefully shitty jokes for 15 minutes and then say, put it in the can, that one's done

54:28.320 --> 54:36.320
Hey guys, what if we did opposite of jokes today for this show? This is a special episode where we do opposite of jokes

54:36.320 --> 54:40.320
What's a cow's favorite cereal?

54:40.320 --> 54:42.320
Moose-lee?

54:42.320 --> 54:45.320
No, it's fucking grass, it's a cow, you idiot

54:45.320 --> 54:49.320
See, that's got some ADC energy that I really like

54:49.320 --> 54:53.320
Yeah, I was trying to do like edgy, I was doing edgy comedy

54:53.320 --> 54:54.320
Yes

54:54.320 --> 54:56.320
We don't do that enough here

54:56.320 --> 54:57.320
Yes

54:57.320 --> 54:58.320
Yeah

54:58.320 --> 55:09.320
2022 Fancy Takes Flight, 20 Rendezvous, we're having a rendezvous with like some edgy, challenging, push the envelope, doesn't have to be funny kind of comedy

55:09.320 --> 55:13.320
Yeah, edgy, where if it's not funny to you it's because there's something wrong with you, not me

55:13.320 --> 55:15.320
I made a solid joke

55:15.320 --> 55:18.320
What about what happens when a cow doesn't shave for too long?

55:18.320 --> 55:20.320
What?

55:25.320 --> 55:28.320
Their bush goes fucking crazy

55:28.320 --> 55:29.320
Oh, I like that

55:29.320 --> 55:33.320
That's a good joke, that joke is funny

55:33.320 --> 55:38.320
Yeah, that's a great joke because now you're imagining like, where does the bush go?

55:38.320 --> 55:39.320
This is true

55:39.320 --> 55:40.320
Like where is the bush at?

55:40.320 --> 55:42.320
Because I think it's all boob down there, I'm not sure

55:42.320 --> 55:46.320
It's mostly boob down there, so where's the bush?

55:46.320 --> 55:50.320
Oh, that's funny, you'd be like, where's the beef? But it's like, where's the bush?

55:50.320 --> 55:51.320
I have one

55:51.320 --> 55:55.320
And that's like a joke on top of the first, that's a joke topping

55:55.320 --> 55:57.320
I got a joke here and it really makes a statement

55:57.320 --> 55:58.320
Yeah, sure

55:58.320 --> 55:59.320
Does it kick ass?

55:59.320 --> 56:00.320
Yeah

56:00.320 --> 56:02.320
What happens when a cow doesn't shave?

56:02.320 --> 56:03.320
What?

56:03.320 --> 56:12.320
Society applies their concept of what beauty is to that cow and judges it for growing a moustache

56:12.320 --> 56:13.320
That ain't it, chief

56:13.320 --> 56:17.320
Well so, but then it has something to say, but I also still got moustache in there

56:17.320 --> 56:19.320
Yeah, sure

56:19.320 --> 56:20.320
Okay

56:20.320 --> 56:22.320
This has been an hour, right?

56:22.320 --> 56:24.320
I don't know, man

56:24.320 --> 56:25.320
Write better jokes

56:25.320 --> 56:27.320
What happened when the cow didn't shave?

56:27.320 --> 56:28.320
What?

56:28.320 --> 56:29.320
Who fucking gives a shit?

56:29.320 --> 56:30.320
Oh, I like that

56:30.320 --> 56:33.320
It's a cow, don't you have better things to worry about?

56:33.320 --> 56:34.320
Cows don't fucking shave

56:34.320 --> 56:36.320
Cows don't even shave, dumbass

56:36.320 --> 56:37.320
It's a good one, man

56:37.320 --> 56:40.320
Oh, edgy, see, you got it in there

56:40.320 --> 56:42.320
Yeah

56:42.320 --> 56:47.320
Um, we gotta do something else

56:47.320 --> 56:49.320
We have to do anything else right now

56:49.320 --> 56:51.320
Okay, I got you, don't worry about it

56:51.320 --> 56:55.320
Is it a fucking shitty cow joke that we can be ironic on?

56:55.320 --> 56:57.320
Um, no

56:57.320 --> 56:58.320
Okay

56:58.320 --> 57:00.320
But is that a problem?

57:00.320 --> 57:02.320
Wait, but is it a problem if it's not?

57:02.320 --> 57:04.320
Does it need to be that, or?

57:04.320 --> 57:07.320
One, two, three, four, five

57:07.320 --> 57:09.320
Moobaga

57:09.320 --> 57:12.320
Come on, let's ride to the builder's yard around the corner

57:12.320 --> 57:16.320
The gang's all here and it's time for us to do what we wanna

57:16.320 --> 57:18.320
There's a house with a roof that leaks

57:18.320 --> 57:21.320
It's an urgent job and it could take us weeks

57:21.320 --> 57:24.320
There's Dizzy, Lofty, and Rowdy too

57:24.320 --> 57:27.320
Wendy always knows just what to do

57:27.320 --> 57:29.320
There's no job too big or small

57:29.320 --> 57:32.320
With scoop and muck, we can do it all

57:32.320 --> 57:35.320
Metal, brick, or wood, it's all good

57:35.320 --> 57:37.320
And we can always send in the tractor

57:37.320 --> 57:40.320
A little bit of timber and a saw

57:40.320 --> 57:43.320
A little bit of fixing, that's for sure

57:43.320 --> 57:45.320
A little bit of digging up the road

57:45.320 --> 57:47.320
A little bit of moving

57:47.320 --> 57:49.320
What are we listening to?

57:49.320 --> 57:50.320
You have to stop

57:50.320 --> 57:51.320
I did

57:51.320 --> 57:53.320
No, but here's the problem, Justin

57:53.320 --> 57:55.320
When you play things through your computer

57:55.320 --> 57:57.320
If we talk at Echoes, so you

57:57.320 --> 57:58.320
I know, I love that

57:58.320 --> 57:59.320
You are holding us hostage

57:59.320 --> 58:00.320
That is like a power play

58:00.320 --> 58:01.320
Yeah

58:01.320 --> 58:03.320
So you just gotta hear Bob the Builder's take on

58:03.320 --> 58:05.320
Lou Vegas Mambo No. 5

58:05.320 --> 58:07.320
Can I, I had, this is a great idea

58:07.320 --> 58:09.320
And I'm assuming the show's over by now

58:09.320 --> 58:12.320
Was that just like a palette cleanser you were playing to get us

58:12.320 --> 58:16.320
That was like, I found, I found Mambo the Trumpet

58:16.320 --> 58:18.320
And it was just like six minutes of trumpet

58:18.320 --> 58:19.320
Like, that's not a joke

58:19.320 --> 58:23.320
And then related to that was Bob the Builder's take on Mambo No. 5

58:23.320 --> 58:25.320
I thought, maybe this is something

58:25.320 --> 58:26.320
So then I played that

58:26.320 --> 58:28.320
But you just played it

58:28.320 --> 58:30.320
Yeah, I don't have anything to say about it

58:30.320 --> 58:32.320
Its existence is funnier than jokes

58:32.320 --> 58:33.320
Okay

58:33.320 --> 58:36.320
I was just thinking about how it would be cool to make a song called

58:36.320 --> 58:38.320
Mambo No. 2340

58:38.320 --> 58:43.320
And the year is, the year is 32,000

58:43.320 --> 58:44.320
Like Warhammer, kinda

58:44.320 --> 58:45.320
Yeah, sure

58:45.320 --> 58:47.320
And it's like, it's all, it's so far in the future

58:47.320 --> 58:49.320
And we've continued to have new Mambos

58:49.320 --> 58:53.320
And it's like, this is the 2037th Mambo

58:53.320 --> 58:54.320
Yeah

58:54.320 --> 58:56.320
That we're writing in the year 32,000

58:56.320 --> 58:57.320
That would be awesome

58:57.320 --> 58:59.320
And it's like filled with jokes about how

58:59.320 --> 59:03.320
The year 32,000 nutrient slurry that everybody eats doesn't taste very good

59:03.320 --> 59:04.320
Oh, yeah, yeah

59:04.320 --> 59:05.320
And it's like listing the names

59:05.320 --> 59:08.320
And it's like, a little bit of Beep Bop in my life

59:08.320 --> 59:09.320
Yeah

59:09.320 --> 59:10.320
A little bit of Foo Fob in my

59:10.320 --> 59:13.320
And it's just like, even then people are listening to it going

59:13.320 --> 59:14.320
Those aren't names

59:14.320 --> 59:15.320
It's like, yeah, I know

59:15.320 --> 59:18.320
But I used all, I've used all of them

59:18.320 --> 59:19.320
There's no more names

59:19.320 --> 59:24.320
And then somebody's like, hey guys, I found this weird old holovid on YouTube

59:24.320 --> 59:26.320
And I just have some questions for you

59:26.320 --> 59:28.320
One, what is a buffalo?

59:28.320 --> 59:29.320
Two, what is a wing?

59:29.320 --> 59:31.320
Three, what is a guy?

59:31.320 --> 59:33.320
Also, where can I get this fucking meal?

59:33.320 --> 59:35.320
Cause it's working

59:35.320 --> 59:36.320
Can we get a pill?

59:36.320 --> 59:39.320
Get the replicator to make a pill of the guy with the buffalo

59:39.320 --> 59:41.320
Also guys, what happens when a cow doesn't shave?

59:41.320 --> 59:42.320
What?

59:42.320 --> 59:43.320
It grows a moustache

59:43.320 --> 59:45.320
Stop the fucking show, Justin

59:45.320 --> 59:47.320
Say the shit that you say at the end of every episode

59:47.320 --> 59:49.320
Thanks for listening to our show

59:49.320 --> 59:52.320
We'll feel better next week

59:52.320 --> 59:54.320
And maybe we'll do better

59:54.320 --> 59:55.320
No, we did fine

59:55.320 --> 59:57.320
I don't like people thinking they waste it

59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.320
Cause most people are listening to 1.25 anyway

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:05.320
They're just blowing through to see what, like how we're going to be realigning the culture

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.320
You know what I mean?

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.320
It's less about the humor and more about just like keeping their finger on the pulse

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.320
Well, but if they listen that fast, they're going to miss all the little like Easter eggs

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:17.320
And like winks at like stuff we have planned for the future and where the story's going

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:22.320
You actually would miss the sheer amount of time we just let hang in the air

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.320
After the first reading of that moustache joke

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.320
That is true

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.320
Go back and listen to that at like 0.75

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.320
I was spiraling a little bit

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.320
Thanks so much

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.320
Thanks to you for listening

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.320
Griffin, do your bit

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.320
Thanks to Montane for the use of our theme song

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.320
My life is better with you

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.320
Thanks Montane

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.320
I'm a show stopper and a show stopper

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.320
Literally

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.320
Make sure you go check out McRoyMerch.com

We got the pin of the month

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.320
Everybody has a knife

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.320
Which benefits the center for reproductive rights

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.320
We have guppies want me

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.320
Blink shards fear me sticker over there

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:57.320
I have been doing some streaming on Twitch

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.320
Playing, get this guys, a little game called Fortnite

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.320
And it rules

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:05.320
You can check that out at twitch.tv slash the Travis McRoy

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.320
Also Griffin has been doing a regular stream on Wednesdays

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.320
On the McRoy Family YouTube

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.320
In which I believe I'm describing this correctly

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.320
He plays video games as Guy Fieri

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.320
Nope, that's not it

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.320
Not even close

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.320
I'm pretty sure that's it

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.320
It's cool that you are supporting my art though

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.320
I really like it Griffin

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.320
Thank you

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320
The kids like it too

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320
Oh that's awesome

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.320
Yeah man, so cool

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.320
That's going to do it for us this week

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.320
Griffin, do you have a final yahoo to go out on?

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.320
Yeah, thank you everyone

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:42.320
I have a final yahoo that was sent in by Chimneyman

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.320
Chimneyman?

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.320
I'm so afraid of the Chimneyman

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.320
Please don't bring him into this

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.320
It's not that Chimneyman

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.320
We've said it twice so we have to stop there

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:54.320
So, thank you sir

01:01:54.320 --> 01:02:01.320
So it's written by yahoo answers user

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.320
Crispifer

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.320
Crispifer?

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.320
Crispifer asks

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.320
Interesting

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:11.320
Crispifer asks

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.320
Crispifer asks

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.320
Crispifer you say

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.320
He asks

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:21.320
Crispifer asks

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:25.320
I'm just waiting whenever you're ready

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.320
We can wait all day

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.320
We're here for you

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.320
You know what I mean?

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.320
Yeah

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.320
Alright

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.320
You have our full support Griffin

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.320
Do you remember some of the stuff you said already?

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.320
Because I could try to catch you back up

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.320
Like some stuff I said in this segment before?

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:42.320
You said yahoo at

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.320
Well, I guess I could do that

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.320
Okay, so I said Crispifer

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.320
And I said it was sent in by Chimneyman

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.320
Oh, not again

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.320
Oh no!

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.320
That's three!

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.320
Oh no!

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.320
Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.320
Rah!

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.320
Shit guys, I don't have time to do that final yahoo

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.320
My name's Justin McElroy

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.320
I'm Travis McElroy

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.320
Shit!

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.320
This is my brother, my brother

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.320
I can't move my fist part

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.320
It's pretty small though

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.320
Can't even ask where the lips

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.320
My bones, my bones, my bones

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:17.320
It's better with you

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.320

It's better, it's better with you

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.320

It's better, it's better with you

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:40.320
My life, oh

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:59.320
It's better with you
