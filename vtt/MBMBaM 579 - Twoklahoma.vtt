00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better with you

01:00.220 --> 01:02.220
Better it's better with you

01:11.420 --> 01:16.300
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me and my show for the modern era

01:16.300 --> 01:22.240
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis big dog a whoo whoo

01:22.920 --> 01:27.220
McElroy, hey, and I'm Griffin McElroy the smallest one of the bunch

01:29.120 --> 01:31.120
Broadway's back

01:31.400 --> 01:35.640
Is it yeah Broadway's back? I heard it last night on the Tony Awards

01:36.520 --> 01:42.800
Broadway is back and me I was so excited to see all the hits of Broadway

01:42.800 --> 01:47.080
Yeah, we're out last night for the Tony Awards kind of a weird one

01:47.080 --> 01:52.680
Oh, it's Tony words you guys know the story with these Tony's there are awards for a Broadway shows

01:52.680 --> 02:00.200
I I heard this year actually they only gave them out to people named Tony, which I thought was cool

02:00.200 --> 02:07.040
You're any any variety of spelling though Griffin was fine Tony Tony or Tony any one of them

02:08.040 --> 02:10.040
no, so

02:10.040 --> 02:17.640
The Tony Awards, I know that you're wondering the Tony Awards last night, what were they honoring exactly because

02:18.320 --> 02:22.120
They didn't do any they didn't do what I know. They didn't do any plays or shows

02:22.760 --> 02:26.680
From the ongoing unpleasantness. I don't know if you knew about this, but they're

02:32.120 --> 02:35.900
Have you guys noticed how you haven't been outside in a while so

02:36.500 --> 02:38.720
They did the Tony's

02:38.720 --> 02:42.320
for the shows that got that were

02:42.760 --> 02:47.160
Do doing it. Yeah, sure, but didn't get a chance to

02:48.880 --> 02:52.600
You know like compete for Tony's wait, right

02:52.960 --> 02:57.480
So basically mean this is wait, this is for shows that were like on Broadway two years ago

02:58.280 --> 03:04.200
Exactly, but like after the last brought you don't understand. I'm saying kind of so right so like it's

03:05.160 --> 03:07.160
just

03:07.160 --> 03:13.960
Moulin Rouge. Oh a little pill. Yeah, and Tina the Tina

03:16.240 --> 03:19.960
So so and so like every award

03:22.600 --> 03:24.720
Like well for best musical it's

03:25.600 --> 03:27.440
Moulin Rouge

03:27.440 --> 03:32.520
Jagged little pill and the Tina Turner musical. Can I tell you something Justin?

03:32.520 --> 03:38.280
I am kicking myself up and down that great white way because this is your chance to get it

03:39.320 --> 03:45.520
If I had known if I had known I would have opened a show in February 2020

03:45.640 --> 03:48.200
you know like I would have I would have

03:49.000 --> 03:53.180
Spent every last dime I had to finally make my little dream come true

03:53.180 --> 03:54.960
I would have done a one-man show

03:54.960 --> 04:01.800
But like apparently that would have been enough right like and I finally could have put on my script. I wrote back in

04:01.800 --> 04:07.280
2009 of mr. McGoran's Wonder Emporium as a musical you could have mounted it

04:07.280 --> 04:11.760
I could have mounted it for sure. I could have done my musical Oklahoma to

04:12.760 --> 04:17.440
To Oklahoma and it wasn't good. It wasn't even done. I only have two songs in it

04:17.760 --> 04:21.600
But I couldn't poor Judd's alive again was one of them

04:21.600 --> 04:27.720
It's about a zombie Judd comes back and look at that. It's another story with the French on top

04:27.720 --> 04:29.720
I

04:30.000 --> 04:37.800
Wanted to the wind is back again, you know, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This one was about how the farmer and the counter man should be lovers

04:38.240 --> 04:40.240
Yeah

04:42.960 --> 04:47.920
They all it's nice even the musical even the shows that weren't necessarily

04:49.760 --> 04:55.280
Like in competition with those other ones. Yeah. Yeah, like if you did a different one like

04:55.280 --> 04:56.480
um

04:56.480 --> 05:03.520
David Byrne did American utopia. Uh-huh. They're like we got a Tony for you. That's right. Come on up. Thank you for doing your show

05:03.520 --> 05:08.560
That's here's a Tony for you. I remember I saw a clip of it where they just stood on stage

05:08.560 --> 05:12.600
I think it was Lynn just stood on stage and started yelling out like did anyone else do any shows?

05:12.880 --> 05:15.440
No less yet. Lynn did his show

05:16.240 --> 05:20.000
Freestyle love supreme with some of his friends and they made it up

05:20.720 --> 05:22.720
What that's

05:22.720 --> 05:28.260
Fucking kidding me. They made it up. Well, we could do that and it's kind of like

05:31.960 --> 05:35.560
The show before we get there cuz like I do that

05:35.560 --> 05:39.160
Yeah, come up with show and it's like no, well, you know

05:39.160 --> 05:44.920
I was actually talking I was talking to Christopher Jackson about it and he did yeah that every night said zooka

05:44.920 --> 05:50.640
Zama zoom zoom zoom. Yeah, I mean yelled it except that wasn't the song you sing and you know all geek tests

05:50.640 --> 05:54.760
I got you. You fell right into my trap Griffin drop that Chris Jackson heat. Oh

06:00.520 --> 06:02.520
That's what shoes I do

06:03.800 --> 06:06.700
Every night before they go on stage they go like, okay

06:06.700 --> 06:08.520
Let's make sure to write this one down

06:08.520 --> 06:12.360
Right because and then they come off stage and they're like, oh that was a great one

06:12.360 --> 06:17.220
All right, you cars and you crushes like I thought you were writing it down Chris and Chris is like shit

06:17.220 --> 06:22.920
I thought you were writing it down Lynn and they like all forget to write it down every night for like a hundred years

06:23.400 --> 06:30.160
Yeah for like a really long show and I also know that there's other people in freestyle love supreme and I don't know their names

06:30.160 --> 06:33.080
And I'm a terrible. I want to say I want to say something else

06:33.280 --> 06:40.240
Yeah, if I could say something else, all right, say it we did we did do it that we did duets there was

06:41.560 --> 06:43.200
We did

06:43.200 --> 06:45.200
famous duets coming back

06:45.200 --> 06:51.480
Famous duets come back. They open with they're like history-making duets. Who do we have and in my head?

06:51.480 --> 06:58.600
I'm sitting there like my arms crossed like there's no joy in the world. There's no way they got a Dita and Kristen

06:59.480 --> 07:01.480
No

07:01.560 --> 07:04.800
No way, there's no way the music swells

07:04.800 --> 07:10.760
I know and and Leslie my friend Leslie over juniors like we got a wicked performance and then they're both are

07:10.760 --> 07:15.520
Yeah, they're both they're both doing it. Fuck me. And that's so good cuz that's

07:16.360 --> 07:18.360
That wasn't it you would think

07:19.600 --> 07:22.120
Certainly. Yeah, you would think that's the end

07:23.840 --> 07:28.520
That's your closer but then who's that? Oh my god

07:28.520 --> 07:35.440
It's Anthony no, you're not

07:37.720 --> 07:43.320
They're both in tuxedos talking about the bohemian life the irony was powerful

07:44.360 --> 07:49.320
Someone's in for help this man. This this husky boy. He's been killed

07:52.040 --> 07:54.040
And Adam Pascal

07:54.040 --> 07:58.320
Reuniting then and then like the audience several people had died at that point

07:58.320 --> 08:02.000
Yeah, and the rest of them are getting on it to leave cuz there's no way like getting up to leave

08:02.000 --> 08:05.540
They're like scoop the book put it in. There's no way there's any more show

08:05.540 --> 08:11.540
I

08:24.580 --> 08:30.820
Look up at the sky that could those glowing red cracks in the sky that have been forming for about five years now

08:30.820 --> 08:38.540
They're back. They're patching up. They're closing up the wounds guys. You would think you would think that that was the end

08:40.300 --> 08:46.300
No, guys, no, no, no, no, they get this guys and then Lynn had to come out with a rap

08:46.300 --> 08:51.780
He made up about the Tonys. Oh my poor friend. Come with me. You don't have to follow price

08:52.940 --> 08:54.820
policy wheels of a tree

08:54.820 --> 09:01.060
With this song here. They wrote down their songs. They came up with their songs a long time ago. They

09:02.140 --> 09:04.980
Do it, of course Anthony rap man. Pascal wrote

09:05.780 --> 09:07.780
wrote all of it

09:10.380 --> 09:14.820
Yeah, but they but I will say this yeah flip it

09:15.340 --> 09:21.080
Lynn had Wayne Brady on his team. Yeah, I was like, yeah, he's bringing out the big guns Chris

09:21.080 --> 09:26.480
Chris Jackson and and Wayne Brady and a cast of thousands

09:29.320 --> 09:34.360
But like they didn't make up a rap about it we just it's very like making things up

09:41.440 --> 09:44.760
We actually got an invite and I forgot to tell you guys

09:44.760 --> 09:52.280
Yeah, wait Lynn actually did send us a golden ticket to be on his team for the Tonys

09:52.680 --> 09:55.640
And I forgot to pass it on and that one's on me

09:56.200 --> 09:58.360
Yeah, I'm really really sorry about that

09:59.200 --> 10:07.040
anyway, it was very special and and it's like I did I will if I could just there is one little thing I wanted

10:07.040 --> 10:14.680
In there I do they did they were so everybody had me vaccinated. I'm loving that. Yeah, everyone in the audience is

10:15.200 --> 10:17.200
masked right and I'm like even the

10:27.640 --> 10:31.360
Anyway, everyone is masked and and I'm loving that yeah

10:31.360 --> 10:37.320
And then and there's no musical performances in the first two hours, which are streaming exclusively on pair about plus

10:37.320 --> 10:41.560
Yeah, I watched them gotta see who gets that scenic design war. Yeah, of course

10:42.360 --> 10:45.000
So that they did that part. I'm like, well, I get it

10:45.000 --> 10:50.320
I mean you had to do a scale back thing, but you know safety and then at 9 o'clock

10:50.960 --> 10:56.920
CBS picks up the feed right? Yeah, and apparently they had saved all the performances for that

10:57.440 --> 10:59.440
double block and

10:59.440 --> 11:01.440
I feel like I

11:02.280 --> 11:04.920
Don't think it's fair if I'm elderly

11:05.600 --> 11:12.080
Actor wearing my mask and the entire cast of Moulin Rouge gets to do one giant dry hump

11:12.520 --> 11:19.120
Unsafe literally hundreds of people just dry humping dry humping the chairs dry humping each other. Okay, so

11:20.040 --> 11:26.000
Unmasked dry. It wasn't one dry hump because when you say that it makes it sound like it was like a huge punctuation

11:26.000 --> 11:30.760
At the end like I'll slow pull back like a hive hump if you can imagine

11:33.760 --> 11:35.760
Dry hump god. Yes

11:36.160 --> 11:38.160
2020s best musical

11:38.560 --> 11:40.440
Moulin Rouge

11:40.440 --> 11:47.800
Congratulations. Congratulations. It sounds like everyone had a good time. Hey, listen, can I say everyone seemed very relieved to not be in their house?

11:47.880 --> 11:54.360
Yeah, that seemed that seemed accurate. Uh, it's at the winter garden too. God. What a what a beauty

11:54.360 --> 12:01.680
What a beauty. What a joy to see that back up and running again. Nature's healing. Nature's healing the cracks in the sky. Nature's healing the winter garden theater. Things were fucked up for a while

12:02.080 --> 12:08.320
Really? Yeah, but it's all better now. Everything's fine now. That's what Leslie said. Oh, oh did he?

12:09.160 --> 12:13.760
Leslie said everything's fine now. No, he didn't say that but he did say Broadway's back, which it is. Yeah

12:13.760 --> 12:21.040
Yeah, how can anything be wrong if Broadway is right? Look at Adam. Look at Adam and Pascal up there doing his thing

12:21.040 --> 12:24.840
He's it sounds great. By the way, everyone's had a great. What a great evening. Oh

12:25.320 --> 12:28.400
Boy, they've been honing their craft. I think while they've been kicking it

12:28.400 --> 12:34.800
Oh, that's that's the thing right if you haven't been learning at least three new skills by the end of it of the COVID

12:34.800 --> 12:39.880
What are we doing? Yeah, right. What are we even doing? So this is a an advice show not just a

12:40.760 --> 12:43.760
bunch of guys getting excited about the Tony Awards because like

12:44.480 --> 12:48.200
It was an exciting night. Yeah, sounds like yeah back. Yeah, absolutely

12:48.200 --> 12:50.400
Absolutely, Lynn did a great job, by the way

12:53.720 --> 12:59.800
Yeah, if there's one thing everyone knows about Lynn right and turn it on yeah turn it on

13:00.560 --> 13:02.560
Especially it seems like the procrastination

13:03.120 --> 13:06.960
It gets a better. Yeah, if there's one thing there's two things

13:06.960 --> 13:11.500
Everyone knows about Lynn why he can turn it on to he waits till the last minute. I'm fucking

13:11.500 --> 13:18.140
Every single thing no freestyle love supreme. They're making it up every night. What come on. You're kidding me every night

13:18.140 --> 13:23.180
You know sometimes I actually saw on the show and there were times where they asked the audience to do work for them

13:23.180 --> 13:30.140
That's yeah, like you come up with an idea, right? That's why come on, right? It's like I paid to see you guys

13:30.740 --> 13:35.380
You didn't pay to see me. Why should I give you a show lazy to rely on your audience?

13:35.380 --> 13:40.860
So here's our first question. I work as a cashier at a store where we sell scented products

13:40.860 --> 13:47.380
That's excellent. Sometimes when a customer brings one of those items up. I like to take a sniff of it before I scan it good

13:47.900 --> 13:52.740
However, when I brought this up with a friend, she said she thought that was weird. Yes. Yes

13:53.860 --> 13:55.620
Should I stop?

13:55.620 --> 14:00.620
How unintentionally uncomfortable have I made people that's from a wicked whiff of the West. That's very good

14:01.820 --> 14:03.820
now I

14:05.260 --> 14:06.340
Convention

14:06.340 --> 14:13.760
Now as an essential part of information has been lost here and that is if you are in a scenario where you are masked

14:13.900 --> 14:20.680
Yeah in this venue and you're having to like do the little sneaky pull down to get a little whiff

14:24.140 --> 14:26.140
Now here's what I will say

14:26.640 --> 14:28.640
There is a part of me

14:29.140 --> 14:30.880
That I can see this bit

14:30.880 --> 14:36.900
Like if you take a whiff and do that because there's nothing I love more than the feeling of like when you order something off

14:36.900 --> 14:43.980
A menu or you go to buy something and the person says oh, that's the best or that's my favorite and you feel like oh

14:44.020 --> 14:48.100
I won I now I picked the best thing right whether it's true or not

14:48.100 --> 14:51.860
And so if you're like something like oh, this is my favorite one in the whole store

14:51.860 --> 14:54.740
I could see that adding to the customer experience

14:54.740 --> 15:02.220
Experience right, but it also depends on how deep you huffing right? Because if you're like, oh a candle like oh, I love this one

15:02.220 --> 15:04.220
but if you're like

15:05.260 --> 15:08.220
No, I think when it is your house, yeah, we can probably

15:10.940 --> 15:15.620
Okay, stop this is a very musical episode I want to get a Tony apparently

15:17.220 --> 15:21.780
I mean you could be checking for duds, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

15:21.780 --> 15:23.780
Like

15:24.220 --> 15:28.500
This no, this is a croissant give me no get another one wait

15:29.060 --> 15:35.840
Trav do you when they say scented products? Do you think they mean baked goods? No, it's a candle

15:35.840 --> 15:38.500
You don't have I have a French baguette candle. It's fucking incredible

15:39.120 --> 15:44.740
You have a bread candle. Yeah, dude. It smells like bread. It's amazing. What a tease. Yeah

15:45.420 --> 15:47.240
Well, I also do bake bread though

15:47.240 --> 15:52.740
So sometimes it's just to waft them in just keeping your your family guessing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

15:52.740 --> 15:57.220
Keep them on keep that candle is that bread? We'll take a bite of it and find out. I'm just saying

15:57.980 --> 16:04.260
there's no way that the these people that are making these candles are able to

16:06.100 --> 16:09.860
Quality control it so much that a dud doesn't sneak in there from time to time

16:10.220 --> 16:14.820
Yeah, that there isn't just one stinker that sneaks into the batch from time to time. I

16:14.820 --> 16:22.020
I my other question though if you work in a place, that's so jam-packed full of sense

16:22.760 --> 16:26.120
Yeah, are you still getting much out of the experience?

16:26.480 --> 16:27.840
Because you would think after a while

16:27.840 --> 16:34.040
Maybe at the beginning of a shift to put by my interesting four or five hours in you must be overloaded with that stank

16:34.440 --> 16:38.840
Right. Yeah, it's tough when you go into one of those places like the earth sent

16:38.840 --> 16:45.460
It's just like not like just like that you think about it, right though you get a candle to smell something

16:46.460 --> 16:52.380
Different. Yeah, right like to smell like a different smell, right? That's so true. So if you combine all the candles in

16:53.260 --> 16:55.260
the in the shop

16:55.260 --> 16:58.620
They're all just like different smells that you're not smelling then

16:58.820 --> 17:04.120
So if you go are outside the shop and that's like the world. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

17:04.120 --> 17:09.280
Then you go inside the shop and what you're basically getting is the antecedent, you know

17:09.280 --> 17:15.120
Like the anti interesting like the opposite the polar opposite scent from you would get on earth

17:17.880 --> 17:23.040
You're smelling the opposite it's all the different smells that you're not smelling combined into one smell

17:23.280 --> 17:31.040
That is the opposite or the anti scent of I am a million percent sure we've talked about anti-stink before

17:31.040 --> 17:37.440
Oh, definitely. Yeah. Hey Griffin at this point. We're like almost 600 episodes. It's all great

17:37.440 --> 17:41.920
We've talked about everything dude. No, I know but are we cutting-edge

17:42.800 --> 17:46.920
Sign is scientists out because I'm not hearing anybody else talk about anti-scent the stink

17:46.920 --> 17:53.520
That's reverses this does opposite stink the cancel sting cancels it. Yeah new chair and like things like Febreze, right?

17:53.520 --> 17:58.040
That's no no, no, we've talked about that too because that replaces that gives you like now it smells like lavender

17:58.040 --> 18:01.000
I want to completely zero out

18:01.560 --> 18:03.000
Right. I want you know

18:03.000 --> 18:09.440
like you go into a padded room and it's like so quiet because they put like the you know acoustic stuff everywhere and like there's

18:09.440 --> 18:12.360
Nowhere for sound to bounce off. I want that for smell, but we have

18:13.240 --> 18:20.200
Opposite my bin baby because I feel like this raises like so we've at this point then we've talked about everything there is

18:20.200 --> 18:23.360
Yeah, if we're making an opposite of this show, is it like?

18:23.360 --> 18:28.680
heavily researched alternate reality Mert game murder mystery

18:29.040 --> 18:35.120
Okay, every week there's new clues. Yeah, this actually sounds badass and like something I like

18:35.120 --> 18:36.720
Yeah, like hard

18:36.720 --> 18:43.360
I think that is the that's the the the lodestone there is like or your your guiding star is like if it's hard

18:43.360 --> 18:45.320
Yeah, that's the opposite of what we do

18:45.320 --> 18:49.680
I in our show I think that the opposite of what we do on our show if there was an opposite my brother my brother

18:49.680 --> 18:51.680
and me it would be like

18:51.680 --> 18:58.840
coming up with non silly very serious ideas that could change the world for the better and

18:59.160 --> 19:05.360
Then that would then funnel through a pipeline to our show and we would just ruin them by talking about

19:05.680 --> 19:10.680
Like oh that rhymes with fart or whatever. The opposite of our show is like TED talk. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

19:10.680 --> 19:18.640
Not it's like short and to the point. Yeah helpful smart doesn't ramble stays on top. Does it right like a visual aids?

19:18.640 --> 19:22.960
Oh, yeah, like I mean that it's like that the TED talk is like the opposite

19:23.720 --> 19:29.880
It'd be like if Joe Rogan was like wicked smart instead cuz like we're we're also pretty dumb

19:29.880 --> 19:35.220
We're also done like in a different. Yeah, but we're done in a non-threatening sense, but he doesn't write it

19:35.600 --> 19:37.600
This is what I'm saying. It would need to be scripted

19:38.180 --> 19:43.440
Yeah, it would need to be scripted if it's gonna be the opposite of our show. It would be great to have well rehearsed

19:43.440 --> 19:48.120
Oh, definitely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's hard to get left

19:51.600 --> 19:54.140
Yeah, we're like a printing error away

19:59.280 --> 20:01.280
You gotta clean your nozzle heads on

20:03.760 --> 20:09.100
Hey, can I do a can approach the Wizards throne humbly? Yeah, and see what he has for us today

20:09.100 --> 20:15.420
This one's awesome. And this one's good for particularly three of us because this is something that well

20:15.420 --> 20:19.660
Maybe we don't have to worry about quite so much these days during the unpleasantness

20:19.940 --> 20:25.060
But it is important for us to I think know how to sign a cool signature and thank you to Tori for sending this in

20:25.060 --> 20:30.500
I have Leonard this before. Yeah, I mean there's a few steps here and there's some interesting

20:31.180 --> 20:33.460
like things I haven't even considered I think

20:34.620 --> 20:37.380
Ballpark, I've probably signed my name

20:37.380 --> 20:39.340
a

20:39.340 --> 20:42.420
Few like like 20,000 times

20:42.500 --> 20:50.060
I've said my name a lot like in my life and I've never for instance analyzed my signature except to say

20:50.060 --> 20:55.180
Oh, you've analyzed your signature. Oh, yeah, baby. There was that I I think I would guess

20:56.140 --> 20:59.100
And man, this isn't a joke. Maybe 14 or 15 years old

20:59.100 --> 21:04.460
I was like time to turn my signature into an autograph and I just

21:04.460 --> 21:10.740
Handcrafted a very specific signing mechanism. Awesome

21:10.740 --> 21:14.440
So like what's that mean for people who want to like forge checks of you?

21:14.440 --> 21:17.660
Well, I'm not gonna tell me that but mostly I just removed a lot of letters

21:18.180 --> 21:21.340
That's that's an important step and that is a part of this

21:21.340 --> 21:26.120
It's think about which parts of your name you want to include which I've seen your signature for Travis

21:26.120 --> 21:32.820
It's to wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle and then that's it. No, I usually get the S on the end there, too

21:32.820 --> 21:35.020
So it's to wait where we will miss

21:35.860 --> 21:37.860
Yeah

21:38.860 --> 21:44.980
Yeah, that's usually that's usually about as far as we get a lot of people don't know what an uppercase cursive G looks like

21:44.980 --> 21:49.380
So I'm always I'm always that's how weird the General Mills is what I usually turn

21:49.380 --> 21:52.660
That's it. That's a good then. That's also what I do every time I sign my name

21:52.660 --> 21:55.940
I think about that great brand and how they do their G

21:56.340 --> 21:59.900
But it makes it turns me into a sort of international man of mystery. I

21:59.900 --> 22:04.540
Adjust in signature, you know what that is cuz everybody knows that J. It's friendly

22:04.540 --> 22:09.020
It looks like a fun little shoe that something you guys imagine if your name was like Zeke

22:09.380 --> 22:16.020
And you had to sign that in cursive every time every time you put pen to paper and think how do I start this bad boy?

22:16.400 --> 22:20.460
Every time what's that? Yeah, even look like if it was Z

22:21.100 --> 22:22.340
II

22:22.340 --> 22:24.340
uppercase Q

22:24.340 --> 22:31.620
God Zeke get out. That's fucking that's um, that's a maze. You've drawn a children's maze

22:33.220 --> 22:38.100
This cursive I was Google search cursive Z and there's like ten different

22:40.220 --> 22:45.900
It's because of that time they got to that letter in the alphabet everybody was like I'm so tired of coming up with squiggly

22:46.700 --> 22:50.540
Beautiful letters just have fun with it. Whatever you do. Just have fun

22:50.540 --> 22:55.940
Imagine being like in Britain and you got to write ZED anytime you want to put a Z

22:56.060 --> 23:02.420
Yeah, and that's crazy because then it's like who's the deek and it's like that's actually a very cool name

23:02.860 --> 23:07.260
Draw inspiration from other signatures. Look at the signatures of other famous people. I'm just

23:08.580 --> 23:12.600
Well, no, I mean I'm not gonna start signing posters Walt Disney

23:12.620 --> 23:15.940
Why not if you just said like well, that's just what my signature looks like

23:15.940 --> 23:18.900
It says Griffin, but when I write it, it looks like Walt Disney

23:18.900 --> 23:24.900
Yeah, there's some other examples here. John Hancock obviously iconic. It probably took that dude

23:25.460 --> 23:27.720
12 minutes to do this signet like

23:28.260 --> 23:34.980
There's so much calligraphy happening here and that there's like a little what is almost certain like a mason

23:36.340 --> 23:41.420
Like signature like little emblem at the bottom. I'll tell you who fucks me up is curve on a git

23:41.420 --> 23:43.660
He draws he draws like a face

23:44.060 --> 23:48.020
well next to his with like hair and like a squiggly mustache and it's like

23:48.020 --> 23:50.980
Kurt you wrote quite a few books and

23:51.620 --> 23:55.860
Probably signed your fair share of them. You're really gonna do a little doodle, isn't it?

23:55.860 --> 24:02.580
Well doodle in every one stank green doesn't angler fish every time and that it's like who has the time?

24:03.140 --> 24:06.380
Like really stank green and Kurt Kurt Vonnegut. Yeah

24:06.700 --> 24:09.940
Do you think when John Hancock was signing the Declaration of Independence?

24:10.940 --> 24:12.940
Do you think he thought to himself?

24:13.380 --> 24:15.900
Certainly, this won't be the most notable thing that I do

24:15.900 --> 24:22.140
Yeah, certainly the the pica of mice my signature won't be the burning

24:22.980 --> 24:28.340
Shit, do you think that when he went first? He thought this is gonna be how big everyone signs up

24:28.660 --> 24:32.660
This is that is why this is right there. Like he did it first and he's like, let's go

24:33.140 --> 24:38.420
There is like well, there's a lot of us John. Yeah, I wish okay

24:39.540 --> 24:42.140
Fit in here buddy you you rude bitch

24:42.140 --> 24:47.340
Well, I guess I just assumed we'd all write this thing you didn't even ask us

24:47.340 --> 24:49.540
Why would you do some simple math?

24:49.700 --> 24:55.180
You can see we can't fit on there with this car and we only have one pot of ink my dude

24:55.180 --> 24:59.100
This is 1776 are we supposed to pop down to stables? Come on?

25:00.260 --> 25:03.700
Hey, hey, do y'all think I think it'd be pretty dope

25:04.420 --> 25:10.380
if like in Jurassic Park we could bring John Hancock back and then he was like

25:10.380 --> 25:12.500
Looking around. He's like damn Hamilton's

25:13.140 --> 25:16.340
Huge and but I where's the old? Where's the John?

25:17.220 --> 25:20.620
And then he saw oh fuck. Wait, there is a movie called Hancock

25:20.620 --> 25:26.060
I gotta get down on this and he goes he watches it and it's not what he wants it to be because it's like a

25:26.060 --> 25:31.740
Will Smith superhero rock. I don't remember any of this. I don't remember dude. I don't remember any of it

25:31.740 --> 25:34.700
I don't remember having superpowers falling in love with Charlize Theron

25:34.700 --> 25:40.300
But I'm doing that right now watching. I'll try it. I'll give it a shot magnetic

25:41.020 --> 25:45.660
Underline your signature for emphasis. Whatever. Don't fucking do that. No, don't do that unless

25:46.140 --> 25:51.100
John Hancock did that if it's part of a letter if you could do like an S at the end and then it goes

25:51.100 --> 25:55.500
Sue right back across the back like that if it's included as part of a letter

25:55.500 --> 25:59.860
I think that he does he does he does a tail off his K

25:59.860 --> 26:05.580
Look at this which goes down in and he does another H below his name. Yeah

26:06.580 --> 26:08.380
ready to do a

26:08.380 --> 26:12.060
Reprise of Hancock and there was like alright stop Hancock, too

26:12.540 --> 26:17.780
So then there's about like eight different variations on ad flourishes. This one's

26:18.420 --> 26:23.460
Amazing though this person in these images by the way signing their name wiki how which is fun

26:23.460 --> 26:29.180
Number six add numbers or symbols to your signature. Oh like Ke$ha. Okay

26:29.180 --> 26:34.260
The symbols might include a team jersey number a simple sketch or a graduation year

26:34.260 --> 26:37.820
If you associate a specific number or symbol with your identity for instance

26:37.820 --> 26:39.980
If you're well known for your role on a sports team

26:39.980 --> 26:44.220
This may be a good way to publicly distinguish yourself from people with similar names

26:44.940 --> 26:47.100
It could also be a good called shot though

26:47.100 --> 26:51.020
If you're not distinguished as a sports team and you want to become so

26:51.020 --> 26:58.820
Just start writing like Travis McElroy number 25 and then we're like what but then like you do train and you put in the work

26:58.820 --> 27:03.940
And you get drafted by the Eagles in the first round and you're like, this is a dream come true

27:03.940 --> 27:05.940
And they're like your number

27:05.940 --> 27:07.940
78 and you're like fuck

27:08.500 --> 27:14.020
Can't change can't be this one. Oh, sorry, man. This one's already this guy's already got this one. Shit. Can we trade?

27:14.940 --> 27:20.020
What they have done in this picture though is they've written the number 23 just like above

27:20.020 --> 27:27.060
The word wiki had the signature wiki how you can which I'm pretty sure if you do that on like for instance a check

27:27.060 --> 27:29.460
The bank is going to say this is invalid

27:29.900 --> 27:34.580
You can't just the numbers live on the check in very specific

27:34.580 --> 27:41.580
We've made little homes for the numbers to live on in check and you can't just go writing shit like that down willy-nilly

27:41.700 --> 27:45.540
I I would also say and I'm looking this up because I might be wrong

27:45.540 --> 27:51.300
But number 23 is Michael Jordan, right? Like which is awesome, which is an awesome number to put down there

27:51.300 --> 27:55.340
But like I know that and I don't know anything about sports

27:55.580 --> 28:00.740
So I think if you just want to start putting number 23 and people were like, is that your number and back now man?

28:01.180 --> 28:03.900
Big fan of George. Yeah, so

28:04.660 --> 28:07.460
Jordan hey, I hate you know why I hate writing checks

28:07.460 --> 28:15.380
Why cuz pre a lot of the time it's got the word 40 on there and I got to write the word for me. Oh, yeah

28:15.380 --> 28:18.300
It's like it's like six or seven minutes. Just like

28:19.460 --> 28:25.900
Like trying to dig deep like is that you in there or not? It's a tough one. Oh my god, Justin. Okay, I

28:26.620 --> 28:28.780
Thought you were saying I thought you were saying

28:29.380 --> 28:33.940
Because you are a 40 year old man. Is that you Justin inside the number?

28:33.940 --> 28:37.620
I wasn't even thinking about the spelling of the word 40, but yeah, man, you gotta write that

28:37.620 --> 28:40.200
Sometimes you have to write the word and it's like how do you spell?

28:41.340 --> 28:43.620
I thought Justin was having an existential crisis

28:45.300 --> 28:49.220
But that's no no, no, I should have been more clear like you have to write the the

28:49.740 --> 28:51.740
For the kids that haven't written checks

28:52.180 --> 28:54.180
Cuz I know a lot of teens

28:54.180 --> 28:58.900
I'm not writing checks. You gotta write the the words of the numbers. We have

28:58.900 --> 29:03.380
To make sure you're serious about this on an episode of my brother my brother me too cuz you guys come on you can't keep saying

29:04.580 --> 29:09.420
That's not our job. Yeah, that's right. Like that accountability is not it's not our problem

29:09.420 --> 29:13.860
You know, my least favorite part of writing checks is what Miley Cyrus's favorite part of rain

29:14.620 --> 29:20.300
Favorite part arranger probably signing up and cash to take him to the big bank. Where's my checkbook?

29:20.300 --> 29:23.740
You know what I mean? Like where is that thing? I use it once a year. Hey, Billy, right?

29:23.740 --> 29:25.740
I

29:27.700 --> 29:29.700
Probably calls him dad, don't you think?

29:34.820 --> 29:38.540
No way, maybe before he had that collab I was Lil Nas X

29:38.540 --> 29:44.460
Yeah, and then like before that it was probably dad, but he's like no, honey. Now I'm Billy Ray. I'm

29:45.820 --> 29:48.660
They just did a goof about me on Great British Bake Off. I'm back

29:48.660 --> 29:55.580
I bet Billy Ray was kind of pissed off that he couldn't translate that that success in the other. I got some other stuff in my

29:55.580 --> 29:57.100
Catalog, you guys

29:57.100 --> 30:03.380
Yeah, I bet it's passively earning money all the time. Justin. Come on. I mean, I'm sure that that goes down

30:03.380 --> 30:05.100
I think Billy Ray counts himself

30:05.100 --> 30:10.760
very lucky on days where he gets called Billy Ray in the house in the household and not just like

30:10.760 --> 30:18.560
My least head or hey, hey dip shit. Hey, get me my checkbook scum nut. Hey

30:19.880 --> 30:21.880
The dog saying that

30:23.800 --> 30:29.080
Billy Ray Cyrus, okay, he's from sort of our neighborhood right from flowers, Kentucky

30:29.080 --> 30:32.240
It's not too far from our neck of the woods. Billy Ray Cyrus has this

30:33.000 --> 30:39.080
Jumbo hit with achy-breaky heart filmed at the Paramount Theatre over national data. Yeah, if you ever watch that video

30:39.080 --> 30:43.200
It's right right around here. So Billy Ray has this Jumbo hit, right?

30:43.200 --> 30:47.920
And it's like he starts to fade away and everybody's like, well, that was a cool run with Billy Ray

30:47.920 --> 30:52.840
I wonder whatever happened that dude. He's like, oh psych my daughter's the most famous person on the planet

30:53.960 --> 31:00.200
Swing at it. Huh Billy daughter. Oh, my daughter's those famous person planet. All right, so Billy Ray's back

31:00.200 --> 31:03.640
Oh, he's on Hannah Montana. He's back and then it just wouldn't start to ebb

31:03.640 --> 31:10.860
He's backing like the biggest song on the planet this dude. We keep putting him back at bat

31:11.020 --> 31:17.340
It's wild how he just keeps like finding his way. Yes, you have someone loose. Oh, hey, yeah

31:18.220 --> 31:20.220
Okay, you want to sell your soul again?

31:21.060 --> 31:26.020
Man, I don't know. It's been like five times dude. Like I don't know if we can keep making this deal my man

31:26.020 --> 31:31.560
All right. Yeah. Yeah, you got it. You want to be on dr. Quinn medicine one? Okay. Yeah. Sure. Are you sure?

31:31.560 --> 31:35.160
Okay, just sign here in blood man. Yeah, you got it. Okay

31:36.320 --> 31:38.560
Hey, um, Trev, I don't

31:39.160 --> 31:44.920
But that's it's not Billy Ray Cyrus. Dr. Good medicine was just a guy that looks like him. Are you sure he was on?

31:46.280 --> 31:49.440
100% it looks a lot like on hold on

31:50.080 --> 31:56.800
No, we're no one is good. You're thinking of doc doc. Thank you. Yes, the series where this it's a fantasy series

31:56.800 --> 32:04.080
Right, right, right. Yes, you can see how I get this confused though, right? Yeah, I assume there's some kind of crossover there

32:04.080 --> 32:07.200
They probably had a crossover episode like in crisis on infinite Earths

32:07.880 --> 32:09.160
When they made that show

32:09.160 --> 32:14.720
I mean there had to be an episode where somebody's like this guy's heart is fucked up and Billy Ray just starts sweating

32:15.400 --> 32:17.400

BFFs every Friday here on maximum fun to stay informed empowered and have some fun minority corner because together we're the majority

39:08.560 --> 39:10.560
Let's see, I live in Denver, Colorado

39:10.840 --> 39:15.560
The air up here is very thin and dry due to the city's elevation as a consequence

39:16.120 --> 39:18.120
My skin is always super dry

39:18.540 --> 39:20.540
Every winter I look forward to getting cracked

39:20.540 --> 39:27.580
Bloody knuckles. Why do you look anytime a stiff breeze rolls through because of this I was carried small portable

39:27.980 --> 39:33.740
Bottle of lotion in my backpack anywhere I go and every single time I busted out to reapply lotion on my knuckles or face

39:33.740 --> 39:37.800
Someone has to make a joke about why a guy is 20s would actually have

39:38.300 --> 39:39.540
lotion on hand

39:39.540 --> 39:41.540
Wow, you're so horny

39:41.540 --> 39:50.440
Wow, you're so horny you can't even wait until you get over work

39:50.820 --> 39:53.580
Jeez, man. Anyways, that'll be 1495

39:54.460 --> 40:00.620
More like jizz man. I am getting pretty sick of hearing the same joke over and over and over again brothers

40:00.620 --> 40:02.980
Is there any way I can make the joke stop?

40:02.980 --> 40:07.820
Are there any witty responses I should be using or do I need to accept my fate and prepare?

40:07.820 --> 40:14.020
Myself for a lifetime of jokes about where the lotion is being applied. That's from moisturizing not

40:14.700 --> 40:16.700
masturbating in the mile-high city

40:18.340 --> 40:20.340
Love Denver

40:23.380 --> 40:27.140
Lucifer big scary blue sir, the nice nice people

40:29.300 --> 40:33.520
Snowboarding jump ramps love it. I'm ready masturbating every

40:34.860 --> 40:36.140
sucks

40:36.140 --> 40:37.580
that

40:37.580 --> 40:39.580
it it's

40:42.140 --> 40:43.940
2021 and

40:43.940 --> 40:51.980
Everybody's moisturizing. Yeah, and it seems like the people who are doing this to you are the ones who deserve

40:52.660 --> 40:57.220
Derision and not you because I think we've all realized that

40:58.340 --> 41:02.660
It's tough out here. So why not keep it?

41:02.660 --> 41:07.500
It like what like what keep it away. You know what I mean? Like

41:08.340 --> 41:14.220
Why not put that lotion on it and feel better for how it feel moisturized and good for it?

41:14.540 --> 41:19.140
The the problem here question answer is you can really only deal with this one person at a time

41:19.660 --> 41:25.140
Like unless you get some kind of grapevine going where it's like, hey, don't make that joke to Jim man. He's

41:26.100 --> 41:27.140
He's sick of it

41:27.140 --> 41:29.060
Yeah, you're gonna have to do this one person at a time

41:29.060 --> 41:35.500
But I'll give you the response that I think would work best Justin. Can you please say the prompt to me?

41:36.020 --> 41:41.940
The like the one that's outlined here. Yeah. Yeah. Wow, you're so horny. You can't even wait until you get it from work

41:42.340 --> 41:44.340
Jiz man, what do you mean?

41:44.780 --> 41:48.980
Like I'm you use the cream to masturbate wait what it's a joke

41:49.980 --> 41:54.100
Yeah, it's a joke about how you can use cream for a better masturbation experience

41:54.100 --> 41:59.940
No one actually does it. I don't think but it is a fun joke from high school. Are you talking about? Yeah

41:59.940 --> 42:05.700
well, you see you have cream and you use it to squeeze your part until the

42:06.500 --> 42:10.580
Tell the just comes out from the good feel. Are you making this up?

42:11.500 --> 42:17.220
No, no. No, it's a popular joke. Let's here. Come here. Oh, let me open my computer here

42:17.220 --> 42:22.620
I'll show you some of the different things about it. You see now. I'm surprised you don't know about this follow. Oh

42:22.620 --> 42:26.100
Oh, okay. Well see what happens is you?

42:27.100 --> 42:32.700
Use the lotion on your I believe in some nations is called a tally whacker

42:32.700 --> 42:36.380
Uh-huh, and you use the lotion on there to help the just come better. But why oh

42:37.540 --> 42:40.060
Well, it's supposed to be a better feeling. I don't know

42:40.060 --> 42:44.300
I've never tried it myself, but it isn't it's sort of a fun joke and freeze

42:45.100 --> 42:47.100
Has this ever happened to you?

42:47.100 --> 42:52.460
Hi, everyone. It's me. Dr. Anthony Fauci. I

42:52.980 --> 42:55.020
Pretty much polished off the kovat stuff

42:55.020 --> 43:00.900
and so now I moved on to another subject this dear a dear to my heart and that's using the lotion for when you

43:02.540 --> 43:05.220
Touch it touch shit good to make the stuff come out

43:06.140 --> 43:12.620
I'm a doctor and I've been studying my whole life about this one very cool thing

43:12.620 --> 43:17.100
Which is why it was kind of a hobby weird that I got called up

43:20.900 --> 43:23.740
It's weird I got called up for this other thing

43:25.220 --> 43:29.900
And I the whole time I tried to hint that this was a nasty thing that I liked a lot

43:30.580 --> 43:36.540
During my many press conferences, but people then got pretty pissed off at me and they don't know that I'm a good time guy

43:36.540 --> 43:43.700
Anyway, when you touch it to make it feel good the lotion even is better for you and

43:44.580 --> 43:46.580
Just think about it

43:58.020 --> 44:02.060
Just let him know because if we say it for long enough on the show

44:02.060 --> 44:08.900
Then it becomes Canada this weird sort of splinter reality is created and then anytime anybody talks about Fauci

44:08.900 --> 44:14.140
Yeah, it's gonna be like my wife's gonna talk about Fauci and he'll be like he's that guy that loves the little

44:14.660 --> 44:16.660
Lotion on it when you touch it makes it feel better

44:20.020 --> 44:24.220
It's me, dr. Fauci again, it makes it feel like the real deal

44:25.060 --> 44:27.060
and that's and that's

44:27.060 --> 44:32.780
And that's awesome to me make it feel like the real deal with dr. Fauci's goo

44:38.740 --> 44:41.880
Is he selling a brand of it or is this a public?

44:42.980 --> 44:47.900
Justin it's like how sometimes there's just commercials for beef. Yeah

44:49.340 --> 44:52.740
Get together and it's like eat beef y'all get it

44:52.740 --> 44:58.880
Um, nobody's eating beef. Hey, we need to get people talk about milk. How we gonna talk about milk?

44:59.420 --> 45:01.620
Yeah, okay, so I'm sorry about that

45:03.340 --> 45:05.460
Dr. Fauci, I don't know how to solve this problem

45:05.540 --> 45:11.220
I keep a bottle of lotion next to the bed and my wife has been calling it my spank lube for 12 years

45:12.220 --> 45:16.620
I can do about it. Can't stop no matter how many times I'm like, it's not funny anymore, honey

45:17.500 --> 45:19.500
she keeps going with it and

45:19.500 --> 45:21.500
Um, there's nothing to be done

45:22.020 --> 45:25.580
It's somewhat you pull out your lotion to put on your hands and they're like, oh you so hurry

45:26.020 --> 45:29.780
Use your that lotion masturbate and you say I don't use this lotion masturbate

45:29.780 --> 45:35.120
And then you pull out a second bottle and you go use this lotion to masturbate. It's way cheaper. That's not a masturbation lotion

45:36.980 --> 45:43.500
This is hand lotion, it's like $20 a bottle this it's like 50 cents for like two gallons

45:43.500 --> 45:46.220
My man, and it gets the job done. It's dr. Fauci's good

45:46.220 --> 45:49.500
I gotta buy them both. I gotta buy them both. Yeah, I

45:50.660 --> 45:55.300
Debate so much. I go through gallons of this. Where are you going?

45:56.940 --> 46:01.780
I've had a cat for about four years now and nobody in my family gets her presents

46:01.900 --> 46:06.900
This seemed normal until my mom got a puppy and my brother got a girlfriend with a dog Wow

46:07.340 --> 46:12.340
We really got to get some other commas in here or something to help me decode this way. Yep

46:12.340 --> 46:18.800
Okay, so nobody my family gets her presents. That seemed normal until my mom got a puppy and my brother

46:20.160 --> 46:24.360
My brother brother got a girlfriend with a dog. It's like really fucking me up right now

46:24.360 --> 46:26.880
I know we're just having a lot of fun. I can't park me

46:27.800 --> 46:33.720
Yeah, he used a dog to get a girlfriend. No, he got a girlfriend and the girlfriend

46:34.320 --> 46:38.960
Has a dog I think I don't think I don't think that's right

46:38.960 --> 46:44.320
Maybe the mom getting a puppy somehow led to the but my mom got a puppy and so

46:45.360 --> 46:49.840
Until one of her my brother got a girlfriend with a dog. Take that mom

46:51.240 --> 46:57.080
Okay, English is not specific moving on now everyone in my family gets the dogs presents for gift-giving holidays

46:57.080 --> 46:58.760
But still never get to my cat anything

46:58.760 --> 47:03.920
I thought my cat is being left out and isn't considered a member of the family despite being around the longest

47:04.120 --> 47:08.840
How do I get my family start buying my cat's presents? That's from cat friend in Chicago

47:08.840 --> 47:16.160
You probably can't yeah, I own two dogs and a cat. I've had the cat longer. So that said

47:17.240 --> 47:19.040
dogs are

47:19.040 --> 47:21.040
inherently doofy and

47:21.680 --> 47:22.880
silly boys

47:22.880 --> 47:28.120
Even though mine are two girls and they when they get presents they lose it

47:28.120 --> 47:34.040
Right you give a dog a chew toy or a bone or something and you you're like God

47:34.040 --> 47:38.480
This showering manna upon the people right you give a cat a present

47:38.840 --> 47:40.840
They'll look at it and then walk away

47:40.840 --> 47:43.000
Maybe they'll play with it when you're not in the room

47:43.560 --> 47:48.440
But they're not going to show you any kind of excitement when you give it to like it that doesn't yeah

47:48.440 --> 47:50.440
It's not satisfying to give a cat a present

47:51.480 --> 47:53.480
You know right really don't

47:53.760 --> 47:57.520
I got I got my cat. It's funny. I got my cat's been crying a lot

47:58.000 --> 48:00.920
My cat really has been crying a lot. So I'm trying to cheer her up

48:00.920 --> 48:08.000
by getting her some new stuff to interact with around the house, and I got this little like it's not little it's like a

48:09.320 --> 48:14.760
Crinkly tunnel nice with the bed in the middle. It's pretty big. I mean it's it's pretty big

48:14.760 --> 48:17.760
It's not inconsiderable, and I put it out a while ago

48:17.760 --> 48:24.080
And I realized like I've never seen her do that like be in it or on it. Yeah, and it occurred to me like

48:24.960 --> 48:29.960
This is art. Oh, it's a piece now. Yes now. It's just a piece right now

48:29.960 --> 48:34.320
It's just an installation if I had a dog, but I could tell the dog like can you please interact?

48:34.320 --> 48:36.600
Oh, yes, absolutely, please if you wait

48:36.600 --> 48:41.680
I really got an egg on my face on this you wiggle something near a dog. They're like okay, gotcha gotcha gotcha

48:41.680 --> 48:45.200
I'm right on that man the number of times that I've held something up to my cat

48:45.200 --> 48:51.160
And I've realized after a couple seconds like I look like an idiot like the cat is just staring me like I know

48:51.240 --> 48:54.680
What you want don't get it twisted. I know you want me to play with that thing

48:54.880 --> 48:59.800
I'm not interested in that man and like I don't know what to tell you do we're at an impasse here

48:59.800 --> 49:06.000
I'm just saying that my cat is way cooler than me real stinker. You know. I love her so much. It's just like

49:06.960 --> 49:11.760
She's too good for me. I don't deserve her. I just don't have pets and so I feel like this is

49:12.520 --> 49:15.120
Exclude like excluding me because I don't

49:16.120 --> 49:18.400
I don't have anything to say about cuz I don't have any

49:19.280 --> 49:24.800
You have kids and they're kind of like pets right? Yeah. I don't want yeah. I don't like my cat. Yeah, right

49:24.800 --> 49:30.760
I like one of my dogs a lot more than the other one, and I think that I think they know I mean

49:30.760 --> 49:35.240
I don't have pets, but I feel like that's the kind of thing when you say people don't like it. No listen

49:35.240 --> 49:38.200
I love them both. I just love one a lot more

49:39.000 --> 49:40.360
Yes

49:40.360 --> 49:43.960
It's perfect. Yeah, just like kids just like brothers. I don't know

49:44.880 --> 49:50.000
Cats are doing their own thing cats also like dogs don't have a movie about them by Andrew Lloyd Webber

49:50.000 --> 49:53.120
So there's well. I mean all dogs go to heaven

49:53.120 --> 49:56.520
What's not by Andrew Lloyd Webber, okay?

49:56.520 --> 50:02.040
If you're saying specifically dogs don't have a movie by Andrew Lloyd Webber. I can't argue with you there

50:02.600 --> 50:04.080
Good. I

50:04.080 --> 50:07.320
Could I could argue that okay? Okay? Yeah, they do

50:08.080 --> 50:13.680
Dogs have a bat dogs have a badass movie by Andrew Lloyd Webber. What's it called dogs?

50:14.960 --> 50:18.120
You think he made it you think he made a movie you think he made one called cats

50:18.120 --> 50:23.760
And then he was like time to make one for dogs, and he was like mr.. Mr.. Fluffer's magic day at the city

50:23.760 --> 50:27.120
No, all that fake all that fucking dogs. I

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
guarantee many worse

50:30.720 --> 50:34.440
Comedy people than yeah, I've been like what if he did a musical

50:35.160 --> 50:40.160
Right, and that's our turn a little something. It's our turn. Yeah, I don't want I don't want this at bat

50:40.160 --> 50:43.320
I want to just move on and I help other I bet I could take a good swing

50:43.320 --> 50:47.680
I don't want to do what I think I could crank it out of the park a song from dogs

50:47.680 --> 50:51.040
I think that's just saying one song from dog sure sure sure

50:51.720 --> 50:55.860
Look, thanks Graham here. We go all my beautiful bones

That's uh, that's and that's the first that's the opening song of dogs mr.. Lloyd Webber

51:56.560 --> 52:00.960
I have a quick question was it the dogs bones for chewing Griffin Andrew Lloyd

52:01.800 --> 52:05.960
Is it about the bones in that he's been chewing on like the bones of his body?

52:05.960 --> 52:10.960
That's how Oh, thanks Travis. It's like that's the fucking thing

52:12.520 --> 52:14.520
Oh, I see

52:14.560 --> 52:18.920
Dogs like bones, but it's also a part of them

52:18.920 --> 52:24.120
Thank you Travis for listening and having a basic sort of art appreciation skills

52:25.040 --> 52:32.080
We've been like chugging food so quickly that I wanted to take a quick moment to tell us a quick story

53:05.400 --> 53:10.960
Texts to say your dad just a text Sydney actually and said Clint had to go to

53:11.800 --> 53:16.400
The doctor to get tested because he was feeling sick old bones

53:17.080 --> 53:23.240
Because the doc no because the doctor said to him that it was either they suspected either

53:23.240 --> 53:31.080
a strip throat, you know, like everybody gets 14 times when they're in middle school or

53:32.200 --> 53:39.720
The novel coronavirus which has been such a such a problem. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's the one. Yeah, that's the one

53:39.840 --> 53:44.080

53:44.080 --> 53:50.720
Well, my well my dad knows something so maybe six or seven hours go by it's getting towards the evening and I'm like

53:50.720 --> 53:54.920
I got it. I got to see what's going on because I'm losing my mind over here. I text the guy

53:54.920 --> 53:57.760

53:58.760 --> 54:01.360
He said I'm one. I don't want to just like

54:02.560 --> 54:06.280
So I just say well spoiler alert just to jump ahead. So no one's worried

54:07.160 --> 54:09.160
That's fine. Okay

54:09.640 --> 54:15.320
This is verbatim. Have you heard anything about your tests? He texts back on phone now

54:16.160 --> 54:18.160
hang on

54:18.160 --> 54:24.720
Negative and I say, uh, what a relief all that said no and dad said I know

54:25.160 --> 54:29.760
Thanks for checking on me. Now. What now what would you?

54:30.360 --> 54:32.720
Listener think that my dad meant

54:33.480 --> 54:38.880

54:52.240 --> 54:54.960
Negative on my kovat test now boys

54:54.960 --> 54:56.600
I do want to ask did dad

54:56.600 --> 55:01.280
Communicate to you before this that he was being tested for the novel coronavirus only when I facetimed him

55:01.280 --> 55:05.640
15 minutes before he sent this text message. I haven't spoken to dad in weeks

55:06.280 --> 55:08.040
Weeks. Yeah

55:08.040 --> 55:14.600
Negative on my kovat tests. I said, uh, I dad told me yesterday, but I cared enough to which was an awesome flex

55:15.360 --> 55:17.640
yeah, and then dad said

55:18.680 --> 55:21.160
That was the strep test. I

55:22.960 --> 55:26.920
Just got covered results now my dad then

55:27.560 --> 55:33.240
My dad Clint McElroy told me I had said have you heard anything about your tests?

55:33.240 --> 55:40.320
For kovat and strep him. He's just says negative. He hasn't heard anything about both Justin

55:40.320 --> 55:44.600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no my friend on phone now

55:45.800 --> 55:51.520
Negative, okay, and then I said, uh, what a really probably thought what a waxing to say

55:51.520 --> 55:57.000
I was so worried that you had strep throat. I was so worried. You'll have to eat popsicles

55:57.840 --> 56:01.400
I was so worried about your strep throat. I

56:01.400 --> 56:05.800
I don't know why we're litigating this on on me. I'm on the air

56:05.800 --> 56:09.400
I mean, it's a I said the boys a screenshot because I couldn't believe I

56:10.040 --> 56:16.120
Couldn't believe now on the one hand like I guess I'm kind of guys that I didn't have to worry about my dad having code for

56:16.120 --> 56:20.080
It for a whole day that I kind of appreciate it, but it was not intentional

56:20.700 --> 56:22.700
Yeah, I just don't worry about anything

56:23.680 --> 56:25.200
ever

56:25.200 --> 56:32.280
Oh, that's a good way. Don't worry be happy. Yeah, it works a secret. You guys ever tried it just like everybody home
