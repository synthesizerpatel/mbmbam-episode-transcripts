WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down. If you're all alone, then the pretty birds have flown away.

00:24.000 --> 00:41.000
And welcome. We're back again to the show. It's called My Brother, My Brother and Me. I am, of course, Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. Yeah. Well, y'all do our last names. It seems unnecessary. That is weird. Oh, well.

00:41.000 --> 01:00.000
So people know that we're actual real life brothers. Not those imitation brothers. Like those McKenzie brothers. Those Jonas brothers. Well, they're real brothers. They're just not real people. One of them I'm pretty sure is adopted. Meaning, that's not a real brother. No. Ew, gross.

01:00.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm pretty sure one of them is a doctor. Which is weird. Yeah. It's the same one. It's the same one. They adopted a doctor. Yeah, they adopted a doctor is what they get. Thank you so much for all the support, everybody. Thank you so much.

01:15.000 --> 01:35.000
I had like a hundred thousand downloads for the last episode. My plan is to just, if we just double our audience every time. What I'm saying is, here's my rule. If the number of downloads ever slips from one show to another, we just stop. We're done. We're out. We're out.

01:35.000 --> 01:50.000
You know when the party's stopping. That's when the party's stopping. We're out. I like that. So that's a good reason for you at home. Tell your friends, if you've always been a fan of mine and Griffin's but you didn't know how to get them on board because we only talk about video games.

01:50.000 --> 02:08.000
Now we're talking about everything. Get your SO in the room. What if they've always been a fan of me? If you went to PetSmart and Travis gave you some really kind and courteous service, slipped you some coupons underneath the reg, then now you can listen to him talk about it.

02:08.000 --> 02:34.000
This is the show to listen to with a loved one. Get your SO. Get your boyfriend or girlfriend. Or your hermaphrodite friend. Is that more inclusive? Yeah, get your person. Get your special somebody and listen to the show with them. Say, hey, I want to listen to the show with you. I would prefer if you would download it also on a separate device so our numbers increase like that's reflected.

02:34.000 --> 02:48.000
And then we'll listen to it together but on different systems. And if you want to review it on iTunes, that's also so cool. Some of those reviews are great. Some dude said that he listened to it and it cured all of his diseases.

02:48.000 --> 03:04.000
And if you've been looking for a reason to buy an MP3 player for your pillow with a person on it, this is the time. This is it. And we've got so much now. We've got NBNBAM.com. Oh, Justin Russo. Can we talk about how great that guy is? Oh, man, that guy's blowing it.

03:04.000 --> 03:24.000
Justin Russo's got new art all through if you go to NBNBAM.com, which I'm thinking of a word to try to pronounce that easier. It's obviously doesn't sound cool. I was thinking about mamba.

03:24.000 --> 03:40.000
In my head, I keep saying mumble bam. I want people to have a nickname for it like the mamba. But BIMBAM is terrible. Let me hit you with this one. What about the mamba?

03:40.000 --> 04:02.000
How about my BIMBAM? So go to mambamee.com or our Twitter feed. You know what? Just go to mambamee.com. We've got all the links there, our Twitter Tweety pages.

04:02.000 --> 04:10.000
Actually, there's another link to the Twitter in the website. That'll be up by the time you hear this.

04:10.000 --> 04:20.000
Nobody even uses Twitter. Fix it. You do it. Don't tell me. You fix it. I'm saying we'll fix it. This whole show is falling apart.

04:20.000 --> 04:32.000
First question. This comes to us from FormSpring, so it's anonymous. I'm a geek who plays video games all day. I have a few friends, but unluckily, they're geeks too.

04:32.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm starting university soon and wondered if you had any tips on curing my social anxiety and getting comfortable talking to people I've not met before.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
Thanks, FormSpring. This is something I struggle with on a day-to-day basis. I don't know how you guys feel about it.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
I'm all set. I'm pretty good about it. Hit us with advice, Travis.

04:52.000 --> 05:02.000
The best advice is what I do. Wait for a conversation to form, and then just listen until there's something that you can actually add to the conversation.

05:02.000 --> 05:10.000
Don't jump in. Don't be like, hey, nice shoes. If that works for you, great. But I usually just go, you know, I saw that too, and then join the conversation.

05:10.000 --> 05:20.000
People really love it when you eavesdrop. The basic advice is eavesdrop, and then bring in on it. Really just creepy your way in.

05:20.000 --> 05:29.000
Back the word right in. Remember that you can't really get – we talked about this last week, but it's important. Ask people questions about themselves.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
You can always win friends by getting people to talk about themselves. People love to talk about themselves. That's their favorite topic.

05:35.000 --> 05:43.000
If you ask people about themselves, that's the best way to start conversations. I like your shoes. Where did you purchase them?

05:43.000 --> 05:53.000
The mistake I made going into college was being too aggressive in my friendliness, but introducing myself to everyone like, hey, how's it going? I'm Travis.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
People were like, I am fucking sick of that. What is that dude doing?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Yeah. Imagine being related to him.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
Yeah. It's awful. You could just keep hanging out with geeks.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
There are enough geeks in the world. That's all I know are geeks, dude.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah. My best friends are all pretty geeky.

06:14.000 --> 06:30.000
Also, here's another one. Make yourself more physically attractive. I don't know. Seriously. The upper strata of society. That's how you do it. Just be more physically attractive.

06:30.000 --> 06:38.000
Also, have more money if that's possible. Drive a better car. Be famous. That really helps.

06:38.000 --> 06:52.000
This one also comes from FormSpring, also anonymous. Assume I'm an awesome pretty girl. I like a shy guy and had four dates. First three dates were all in bars at HH.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I don't know what that means.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Hometown Heroes?

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
Hometown Heroes indoor football league. We had a tournament of bar games kind of theme going.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Okay.

07:04.000 --> 07:12.000
The fourth date was a driving range. His idea. How do I get him to transition to a nice dinner? Ask him.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Ask him. Yes. Ask him.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Best advice. Grow a pear and say, let's go to dinner.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Grow a lady pear. Say, we're going to dinner, bucko.

07:21.000 --> 07:30.000
This is the thing. If we could build this bridge, women communicate more directly with men. They're stupid and they don't get it.

07:30.000 --> 07:40.000
If you say, oh yeah, I'd love to go to the driving range. The way this terminates is, I'd love to stand behind you as you play D&D with your friends and get you sodas upon your request.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
This is how it is.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
That sounds so cliche to say, dudes just don't get it.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Dudes, they don't get it.

07:48.000 --> 07:56.000
Even if they do get it, they go, well, you said yes, so that's your bad. Let's go to the driving range.

07:56.000 --> 08:04.000
Here's the thing. If he's taking you to these places, say, hey, I don't want to go to these places anymore.

08:04.000 --> 08:11.000
She probably does want to go to the places. She's not saying – I think the question is one of variety.

08:11.000 --> 08:21.000
If you want to be more subtle about it, tell him there's a restaurant that you've been wanting to try or go to or return to.

08:21.000 --> 08:30.000
If you hit it that pretty hard and he doesn't pick up on it, man, he may not be ready. He may not be ready for the big show.

08:30.000 --> 08:38.000
You sound like an awesome pretty girl. You might just want to dump the zero and get with the –

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
We're not turning –

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Our show is not turning into this, Griffin. It's not going to become –

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Have you met Griffin McElroy?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Have you tried Griffin McElroy?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You've never been on a Griffin McElroy first date.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
I suggest you try some Griffin McElroy this evening, milady.

08:53.000 --> 09:01.000
Do you know hot air balloons are involved? A romantic picnic on a hot air balloon through the night sky? Holy shit.

09:01.000 --> 09:08.000
It's pretty awesome. I just realized she has dates in quotation marks.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
Is it possible she's following this guy to these places and hanging out with him?

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
He wanted to go to the driving range, so I got in my car and followed him.

09:17.000 --> 09:24.000
I've been following this guy for two weeks, and frankly, I'm starving. I need him to go eat at a dinner so I can –

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Assume I'm an awesome pretty girl who's stalking a guy.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
What's the – FormSpring asks us, what's the biggest mistake women make in relationships? What about dudes?

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
I think we've just covered women. That knocks it down. We've got that.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Yeah, saying what you want and then complaining that you're not getting what you want.

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
Well, I don't know. I think the biggest mistake they make would be a murder-suicide pact.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Once you do that, the wheels have fallen off.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
I think we're thinking more common mistakes.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
Oh, common mistakes. I was going to say putting your kids in a car and rolling it into a pond, but that's a pretty big mistake.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
Producing offspring and then burning your house down is probably the worst. That's a relationship in there.

10:05.000 --> 10:12.000
Or, you know what, being Brian Dunkleman and quitting American Idol after season one because she's never going to let you live that down.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
That's your topic of conversation.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
It's a mistake.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
You're talking about Mrs. Brian Dunkleman?

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Mrs. Brian Dunkleman. She would never let him live that down.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I miss that guy.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah, me too. Anyway, I'm going to have a dream sequence while you guys talk about stuff.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
I mean, the biggest mistake you make is cheating. Don't cheat.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Don't cheat. That's not classy.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Honestly, it's communication both ways.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Say what you want. Say what the problem is. Just deal with the shit.

10:40.000 --> 10:52.000
Here's the thing, guys. If you want to know the biggest mistake you make in relationships, it's waiting for your female companion to directly say what she's wanting.

10:52.000 --> 10:59.000
Here's the thing. It goes both ways because, guys, if you're not paying attention to the hints and the things between the lines,

10:59.000 --> 11:07.000
a lot of girls, that's how they want you to show that you care is because you're paying attention to those things and taking that next step.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
They don't have to ask because you know. Pay attention to that stuff, guys.

11:12.000 --> 11:19.000
Also, don't take things for granted. If you keep doing the same thing, don't feel like, well, she must enjoy doing this.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
Do something new. Try something exciting. Don't take it for granted.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Cherish your baby, man. Take her on a hot air balloon ride.

11:26.000 --> 11:34.000
Speaking of cheating and cheaters, this one comes from Yahoo. It's from Yahoo Answers user Billy Bob.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
He says, why did my GF who said she loved me cheat on me right in front of me and not care?

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
I mean, I was right there. She made out with him and then put her hands in his pants. What do I do?

11:46.000 --> 11:54.000
Say, hey, stop. Don't go to Yahoo first. Just tell him to stop first. Put your phone away. Don't stop.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Yahoo, it's going on right now. What do I do?

11:57.000 --> 12:04.000
As I'm typing to you, he's, oh, great. It looks like it's taking care of itself. It's all done.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
It's cool. I need to borrow some chapstick, but his hands are both terribly burnt.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
So I'm thinking, oops, missed his pocket. And now we're making out.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
Oh, Billy Bob. Just tell him to stop, Billy Bob.

12:17.000 --> 12:25.000
And if you're wondering why she's cheating on you, it's because your name is Billy Bob. You're an adult. Get your shit together.

12:25.000 --> 12:32.000
One user named John had this answer. One, punch the guy. Two, spit in her face.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
Three, bang her friends, sisters, and mom.

12:36.000 --> 12:43.000
What? That problem is not fixed. That problem seems exacerbated.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
That's an enumerated list of ways to turn your life around, Billy Bob.

12:48.000 --> 12:55.000
Listen, you and I have both made some mistakes. You made out with that dude, and I banged your friends, sister, and mom.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I think we can work through it.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
More importantly, he spit in her face, which I think is probably the rudest thing you've done about that whole list.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Hey, ladies, spit in her face.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
Remember when you asked us about the biggest mistakes people make in relationships?

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
Just take this question and paste it in to your…

13:13.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah, that answers both sides, because for ladies, it's J.O. and a dude in front of your fella, and for dudes, it's spitting in faces.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
It'll face spit. They'll do that.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Boning down with all the stale, immediate family members.

13:27.000 --> 13:40.000
S. McAvenney is the Twitter user who gave this question to us. He or she goes to a lot of meetings with father-in-law at work.

13:40.000 --> 13:47.000
When and how should I let people we are meeting with know we are related?

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
I totally just read that as, no, we are retarded.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
What?

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
I'm way off. I know. We let them know we're retarded. That was my bad.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
I say you do it immediately, because that would be such a power play if they were like,

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
so you're here to negotiate the big corporate merger. Who's your associate here?

14:06.000 --> 14:14.000
Oh, this is my daddy. This is just my daddy. He's here to help me negotiate the terms of our merger.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Take it away, daddy.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
And then give me a ride home.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
My daddy and I are going to do this.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Excuse me, daddy. I hate to interrupt. Daddy?

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
Daddy, I hate to interrupt. You're making some great headway here, but my daddy and I are going to go to TCBY.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
I love you so much, daddy.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
I did just make a boom-boom, daddy. Daddy, I did make a boom-boom. I'm going to need –

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
here's what you do, dude. Just say it at the beginning so it's not weird.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
Say, this is my father, blah, blah, blah. That lets them say, oh, I can see the resemblance.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
No, it's father-in-law. So if there's resemblance there, you're in trouble.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Oh, crap.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
That's fucked up.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
That makes it slightly less like – I don't know. If you guys were my brothers-in-law, then –

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I see it. I see the problem now.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Okay.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Can I ask you this? I don't have a father-in-law. Why does that matter?

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
Well, it's weird because it's like – it's one of those things where – I don't know.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
If you're in a meeting with somebody and then afterwards they're like, yeah, that's father-in-law.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
It would be weird. Like, why didn't you tell me that?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I don't know. I mean, it's like –

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
I don't think it would be weird unless the people you're meeting with are like, oh, so you're boning down on his daughter, huh?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
What's that like for both of you? Talk about it now.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
Here's what you should do. Just gently slip it in the conversation.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
Like, yeah, I really think this is going to work out like when I married his daughter and then move on.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Just slowly, gently slip it in.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
Why is he not bringing it up? Is he not proud of you?

15:39.000 --> 15:45.000
Why doesn't he say, and this is my son-in-law who I am proud of and in whom I am well pleased.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
This is my baby boy.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
This is my baby boy.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Talk about blood.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
I'm his daddy.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Represent.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
I'm his peppy pep and we're going to do this trade negotiation.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
And then we're going to go get hot dogs.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
We're going to get hot dogs together and go to the big game.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
This one comes from Twitter.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Spizzarelli, which is a pretty cool name.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
My wife refuses to watch The Room.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
One, what the fuck is wrong with her?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Two, how can I get her to watch it?

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
I recently learned that The Room isn't for everyone.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
We're of course talking about the 2003 comedy classic.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Wait, The Room isn't for everyone?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
What?

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I've never shown it to someone who didn't get it.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
We experienced that first time I made my girlfriend Theresa watch it.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
And it's not that she didn't like it, it just made her angry.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
Like she had this look on her face the whole time like she was watching someone get murdered

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
and she couldn't do anything to stop it.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
And afterwards she just couldn't stop saying,

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
How is that a thing that exists?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
By the end of it she'll be a fan. She'll love it.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
The line's blurred for me anymore.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
It's like happened with our friend Dwight and Billy Joel where you start ironically

16:52.000 --> 17:01.000
and then you don't know at the end where the irony stops and the true passion for it begins.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
How can you get her to watch it?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
This is an easy one.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Make it a happening, right?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
You get your other people say like,

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
This is what we're doing.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
That's a lot of fun.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
We have the occasional bad movie night.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
You get people together, you say,

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Hey, we're going to watch this.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
It's a thing, right?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
And that's really the best context to watch it anyway.

17:26.000 --> 17:34.000
If you still can't get her to watch it, you might try it with the commentator.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Who are those?

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Why are their names – what do they go by now?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
RiffTrax.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
RiffTrax.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
It's really – although you –

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
No, you need to watch the original.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Get it here.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Yeah.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
And the thing is if you've seen it 75 times like Griffin has,

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
it's hard to look back and through the eyes of someone watching it for the first time

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
and just going, What? This is awful.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
And it's like, Yeah, but once you watch it four times, then –

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Is this Bad Born?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Are you making me watch Bad Born?

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
And if you invite over –

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
You need to specify right away that it's not Bad Born

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
because that's first question every time I watch it with someone new.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
If you invite over other people who haven't seen it also,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
it's also going to make it less of a deal for her

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
because if you're like a huge fan, then it's like pressure on her to –

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
people feel that.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
If they know you really love something,

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
then there's a lot of pressure on her to enjoy it as she's watching it.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
So just invite over a bunch of other people.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
Matty emailed us. Matty's from Vancouver.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
Matty wants to know, How can I get my girlfriend to move to Vancouver?

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
I feel like this is a trick question.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
How so?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Why is he moving out of America?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
No, he already is out of it.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Oh, he's out of America.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
His title is Matty from Vancouver.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
Can you convince her that Vancouver is not in Canada?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Is that a possibility?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I'm going to be honest with you. I had to look it up.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
I thought it was in Maine.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
It's a little sad.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
I know, isn't it?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
It is.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Why don't you –

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
That's sad. Oh, wow.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Why don't you bring Vancouver to your girlfriend?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Fill up a basket with –

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
And here I'll edit in some things that are from Vancouver.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I don't know, but I'll –

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Maple syrup.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Maple syrup.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Bounties.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Oh, come on.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
That's just racist.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
What?

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
All those things from Vancouver.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Vancouver is actually – they've got a –

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Yeah, on Wikipedia.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
They've got a dope movie scene.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
They're blowing – they're like Hollywood –

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
North Hollywood is what some people call it, the snowy Hollywood.

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
Tell her that there's a chance that she'll see some be-right celebrities there.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Mike Myers is always up there.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
He's always there doing who knows what.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
He's doing live stage presentations of the love guru.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
That sounds good.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Yeah, it is pretty good.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
This one comes from Yahoo user Mike.

19:59.000 --> 20:10.000
How long does it take to get THC out of your system if you only smoke on the weekends?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Basically, I'm applying for a summer job this weekend and if I am successful,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
they will require a pre-employment drug test.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
My question is how long will it take before I can pass the test if I'm an occasional smoker

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
who on average smokes two to three times on the weekends and very rarely during the week?

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
This isn't about not knowing how THC works.

20:29.000 --> 20:37.000
You don't know how time works, like the basic principles of time.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Your interview is this weekend.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
You're effed.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
This weekend, you're effed.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
It's not a question of quantity, man.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
No, no, no.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
Your blood pumps faster on the weekends.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
That's true.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
You get extreme.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
There's things happening.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
You're drinking some Mountain Dew.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
You pee it all out.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I don't know what to tell this guy.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
I do.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
You're effed.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Yeah, you're effed.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Did you smoke this weekend?

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
If you have another weekend approaching, I would suggest not smoking.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
It's not as if the dilution of the weekday is going to help you in this situation.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
No, no, no.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
I ain't doing it on Tuesday.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
No, you don't understand.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I'm doing it on Saturday.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
I'm a very light user in the afternoon.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
It resets.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Your internal THC clock resets every time you do it again.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
I think.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
I don't know.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
We need to talk to a specialist.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
He's not working for the weekend.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
He's smoking for the weekday.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
And then during the weekdays, he just uses heroin.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Yeah, just exclusively heroin.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
His plan is to get so high on Saturday and Sunday that he can just coast.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
He just coasts it on through.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Just coasts it on.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
You feel the itch around Thursday, but it's cool because you know that weekend's coming up.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Maybe just stop.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Dominic writes, Dominic.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
That's how people pronounce that.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Dominic.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Dominic.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Dominic.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
I haven't been able to fly for about four years now due to a bad flight through a thunderstorm.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Oh, it's the worst.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
An increased anxiety over flying, resulting in panic attacks for trips, even walking off

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
a plane because my anxiety got so bad.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I know flying is the safest way to travel.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
I know I'm missing out on things by not flying.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
Any advice that could help me overcome this irrational fear?

22:18.000 --> 22:23.000
First of all, like we talked about last week with the wasps, it's not an irrational fear.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
It is an irrational fear.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
It is.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
No way, dude.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Of course it is.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Now, this is a serious thing for me.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
When I fly, I think it's the most unnatural feeling I have ever had.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
It is unnatural, but that's why it's so awesome.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
Like, whenever I'm flying on a plane, all I can do is marvel.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
Like, I am good.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
Keep it up, mankind, because I'm on a flying craft right now, 10,000 feet above the ground.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
Here's my actual, I do actually have advice here.

22:51.000 --> 22:57.000
What you do is, you remember that this flight seems very special for you, right, because

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
you don't fly that much.

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
There are people on this craft for whom this is the most boring thing that happens to them,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
and that's the flight crew.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
So what you do is, if you get a little nervous, you start to get scared, you hit some turbulence,

23:11.000 --> 23:19.000
you look at the flight crew, and without fail, the stewardess will look so incredibly bored.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
You will always know that there's not anything going on.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Like, because I will think that.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
I'm like, there's no way any plane has ever had this much turbulence.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
It simply never happened.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
And then you look at the stewardess, and she's like reading her Danielle Steel and chilling

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
with her ginger ale.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
It's like, okay, maybe I should relax a little bit.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
And you know what personally always makes me feel better is looking around and realizing

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
there's like 50 other lives in this place that all have their own concerns and own problems,

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
and it's like, well, this isn't just happening to me, and I'm not the only one going through

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
this.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
For some reason, that usually helps me calm down, just knowing that for this two-hour,

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
four-hour, six-hour flight, my life is connected to all these 60 strangers, and by that point,

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
I fall asleep.

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
Another thing you can do is, do you guys remember when you were younger and you would go on

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
a first date with somebody and you'd be in the movie theater, and it would take you

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
like the entire two-hour movie to get up the courage to hold their hand?

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
And so the entire time, your hand is kind of slowly criss-crossing over the air, and

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
it's all exciting and scary.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
What you can do is do that with the stranger sitting next to you on the plane, and stretch

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
it out for the entire, like if you're flying east to west coast, it's like a six-hour plane

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
ride.

24:32.000 --> 24:38.000
It would just take six hours and very slowly just have this campaign of just finger by

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
finger, just moving it.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
You'd be so distracted.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
You'd be so distracted and so scared, and like maybe.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Maybe.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Maybe.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Who knows?

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Who knows?

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
Maybe that large drill sergeant type sitting in 17B made us be your special somebody.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Right.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
And if not, even if you get shot down, your flight's done.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Oops, he touched down.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.600
Chris King does a funny thing where he will tell people, he's a magician, he tells people

25:05.600 --> 25:10.400
that he warns the person next to him before the flight starts that he has a condition

25:10.400 --> 25:14.520
where he falls asleep with his eyes open.

25:14.520 --> 25:20.000
So like 20 minutes into the flight, he'll pretend that he has fallen asleep, and he'll

25:20.000 --> 25:23.540
just stone stare at the person in the seat next to him.

25:23.540 --> 25:26.440
If you can pull that off, I guarantee you, you're not going to be thinking about your

25:26.440 --> 25:29.520
fear of flight.

25:29.520 --> 25:33.140
So this one comes from Dylan via Gmail.

25:33.140 --> 25:38.160
So while I was working a crappy job at an upscale breakfast restaurant, I fell in crush with

25:38.160 --> 25:39.160
a girl.

25:39.160 --> 25:40.160
Is that a thing?

25:40.160 --> 25:41.160
No.

25:41.160 --> 25:42.160
No, Dylan.

25:42.160 --> 25:43.840
It might be a new hip lingo.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.240
I like it.

25:45.240 --> 25:49.040
The problem was she would always say totes in place of totally.

25:49.040 --> 25:53.520
Well, I started doing it in a way of ironically ridiculing her and trying to force herself

25:53.520 --> 25:55.660
to view her own unacceptable behavior.

25:55.660 --> 25:59.240
The problem arose thereafter when I kept saying it all the time, and now all my friends say

25:59.240 --> 26:00.240
too.

26:00.240 --> 26:03.520
My question is, should I be proud that my friends view me as the social god, which all

26:03.520 --> 26:07.400
others must be judged against, and for that reason they emulate my dialect, or should

26:07.400 --> 26:11.040
I feel guilty for making everybody I know just a little bit stupider?

26:11.040 --> 26:12.040
P.S.

26:12.040 --> 26:15.240
I've totally been on a low-fat yogurt with granola trend lately.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.800
What are the McRoy's snacking on?

26:17.800 --> 26:18.800
Well slang genius.

26:18.800 --> 26:22.440
A few different points here.

26:22.440 --> 26:28.160
First off, in your postscript, you say totally, so I think you're on the road to recovery.

26:28.160 --> 26:33.400
That's pretty friggin' judgmental for a guy who said felon crush.

26:33.400 --> 26:39.320
I think maybe you've got some other things you need to address, Dylan.

26:39.320 --> 26:43.120
There's nothing wrong with subverting.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.560
We invented language, not the other way around.

26:45.560 --> 26:50.400
There's nothing wrong with subverting grammar to your own whims.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.400
You know, eventually-

26:51.400 --> 26:52.880
Especially making words short.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.340
Yeah, that's always good.

26:54.340 --> 26:55.340
Always good.

26:55.340 --> 26:57.840
You waste so much time with all the syllables.

26:57.840 --> 27:03.160
I used to not get on the totes train, but now I'm all about it.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.480
I don't know what happened to me.

27:04.480 --> 27:10.600
You should also be aware that if you start saying something ironically, you will never

27:10.600 --> 27:11.600
stop saying it.

27:11.600 --> 27:17.360
That is how these things happen.

27:17.360 --> 27:18.560
Here's another thing.

27:18.560 --> 27:27.000
If you are trying to start a relationship with somebody, maybe bullying them about their

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
grandparents.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
No, no.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
I get it.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
That's a playful thing.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
You just break her down.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Yeah, you just break her down.

27:33.000 --> 27:43.520
Sexily break down her spirits, or is it possible that she was talking about strapped canvas

27:43.520 --> 27:44.520
attache cases?

27:44.520 --> 27:45.520
Oh, it's like totes.

27:45.520 --> 27:46.520
Like tote bags.

27:46.520 --> 27:49.920
Yeah, like hand me my multiple totes.

27:49.920 --> 27:55.240
Towards the point of you asking if you are the social god or not, I find that there's

27:55.240 --> 27:59.360
a phenomenon where you don't notice other people are doing something until you start

27:59.360 --> 28:00.360
doing it.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.600
Then you're like, oh my god, I just started this.

28:02.600 --> 28:08.240
Even if you were the first person to do it, chances are across the globe, 25,000 other

28:08.240 --> 28:12.280
people started doing it at the exact same time, spread out.

28:12.280 --> 28:16.800
That idea of I brought this to my friends and now they're all saying it, you might

28:16.800 --> 28:21.960
have made them feel okay with saying it, but chances are it didn't directly come from

28:21.960 --> 28:22.960
you.

28:22.960 --> 28:23.960
Why do you have to tear them down?

28:23.960 --> 28:24.960
No, I'm just saying.

28:24.960 --> 28:28.840
I mean, he doesn't have to feel bad about making his friends feel stupider, and also

28:28.840 --> 28:35.360
I don't think it is stupider to say totes, because it's like a contraction of do and

28:35.360 --> 28:37.120
not and making it don't.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.120
That's not stupid.

28:38.120 --> 28:42.840
We're all just used to it by now, and so in a hundred years when people are saying totes

28:42.840 --> 28:46.880
instead of totally to shorten the word, it won't be stupid.

28:46.880 --> 28:50.120
It's just a new way of saying an old thing.

28:50.120 --> 28:59.440
Also, Sour Punch Strawberry Sour Tape, we've got a big, big box of Sour Punch Strawberry

28:59.440 --> 29:03.040
Sour Tape that our friend Nick Rose gave us.

29:03.040 --> 29:09.360
He I guess sells it or he hands out trial products and he had literally probably a three-foot

29:09.360 --> 29:13.980
by two-foot box of sour tape that he just had.

29:13.980 --> 29:18.600
He gave it to us and that's what we've been snacking on here in Cincinnati.

29:18.600 --> 29:22.440
Pretty exclusively, yeah.

29:22.440 --> 29:25.120
That's consisted of some meals, actually, at this point.

29:25.120 --> 29:26.840
Hand me eight of those snack tapes.

29:26.840 --> 29:27.840
What have you been snacking on?

29:27.840 --> 29:32.440
I'm not going to answer this because this is an advice show, not a show about snacks.

29:32.440 --> 29:36.520
I advise you to eat Sour Punch Strawberry Sour Tape because it tastes good when you

29:36.520 --> 29:38.160
eat it and it's filling.

29:38.160 --> 29:43.280
As brothers, have you ever lied to your parents as a group in one lie extravaganza?

29:43.280 --> 29:45.920
What do you feel the best way to lie to parents?

29:45.920 --> 29:47.240
Laying back story?

29:47.240 --> 29:50.320
It's even thickened.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.020
Our dad just called all of us.

29:53.020 --> 29:54.020
He called me.

29:54.020 --> 29:56.800
I'm sure he called you too to say he listens to this show so I don't think we should air

29:56.800 --> 29:57.800
it out.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.120
We're not going to smoke this out.

29:59.120 --> 30:01.800
I will say one word, commitment.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.800
Commitment.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.800
That's what it is.

30:03.800 --> 30:04.800
That's the secret.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.760
Also, don't be too specific because that it seems planned out.

30:07.760 --> 30:08.840
Why can't I just be terse?

30:08.840 --> 30:09.840
Why can't I just say commitment?

30:09.840 --> 30:13.360
Why can't you just be terse, Travis?

30:13.360 --> 30:17.040
There's one thing in life I'm really good at and it's lying and I want to pass that

30:17.040 --> 30:18.040
on to the people.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.040
I'm good at it too.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.440
That's why I said I was happy to have you on this show, but you're making me regret

30:21.440 --> 30:22.440
it.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.440
Fair enough.

30:23.440 --> 30:24.440
Fair enough.

30:24.440 --> 30:25.440
Moving on.

30:25.440 --> 30:27.680
Let's move on before we get into trouble.

30:27.680 --> 30:28.680
This one comes from Yahoo!

30:28.680 --> 30:29.680
Answer's user SirSketchy.

30:29.680 --> 30:30.680
Good start.

30:30.680 --> 30:31.680
Good start.

30:31.680 --> 30:32.680
Strong start.

30:32.680 --> 30:33.680
Oh, my God.

30:33.680 --> 30:38.360
This one, I don't know, this one might hit you as funny.

30:38.360 --> 30:44.200
It might just make you confused, sad, but my girlfriend threw my dog off my balcony

30:44.200 --> 30:45.200
when I broke up with her.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.760
I'm not sure what to do.

30:46.760 --> 30:47.760
Oh, no.

30:47.760 --> 30:48.760
I'm so confused.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.560
Should I call the police?

30:50.560 --> 30:51.560
Okay.

30:51.560 --> 30:52.560
Okay.

30:52.560 --> 31:00.480
We need to have another podcast called When Is It The Right Time to get an answer from

31:00.480 --> 31:01.480
Yahoo!

31:01.480 --> 31:05.560
And when is it the right time to make this an actionable situation?

31:05.560 --> 31:11.200
Because these are constantly from people who are in, there's a bus and my leg's broken

31:11.200 --> 31:14.440
and I'm lying in the bus.

31:14.440 --> 31:18.120
The bus is coming at me and I, please help me, Yahoo!

31:18.120 --> 31:22.080
I understand like his confusion, like, is that dog murder?

31:22.080 --> 31:23.080
Is that a crime?

31:23.080 --> 31:26.680
How about you go fucking check on the dog first and see if he's dead or not yet?

31:26.680 --> 31:27.680
How about that?

31:27.680 --> 31:30.760
How about you take your dog and you fucking give it a burial and you go through a little

31:30.760 --> 31:33.480
mourning before you start worrying about repercussions?

31:33.480 --> 31:34.480
Call the police.

31:34.480 --> 31:38.280
What are you going to get, fucking CSI out there?

31:38.280 --> 31:40.800
They're going to throw a whole chalk outline?

31:40.800 --> 31:42.120
There's not a case to crack.

31:42.120 --> 31:43.120
What happened, sir?

31:43.120 --> 31:44.960
I couldn't see my dog off the balcony.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.480
Well, solve another one, guys.

31:46.480 --> 31:47.480
Solve another one, guys.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.480
Let's take it home.

31:48.480 --> 31:49.480
Good work, Larry Fishburne.

31:49.480 --> 31:50.480
Video's a diner.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.480
Let's lock it up.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.480
Lock it up.

31:52.480 --> 31:53.480
Oh, man.

31:53.480 --> 32:00.480
Yeah, call the police and then move as far away as you possibly can.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.800
Are there any sweet answers for that one?

32:02.800 --> 32:04.360
None of that.

32:04.360 --> 32:05.360
Call the cops.

32:05.360 --> 32:08.200
That's animal abuse and she will go away for doing that.

32:08.200 --> 32:11.040
One guy whose name is just G!

32:11.040 --> 32:14.560
The exclamation point says, nope, just throw her off the balcony.

32:14.560 --> 32:17.640
Yeah, people will probably call the police about that one, though.

32:17.640 --> 32:21.840
If you're wanting to get the police involved, that seems like a pretty good way to do it.

32:21.840 --> 32:25.480
I would love to hear that argument in court, though, like, sir, why did you throw your

32:25.480 --> 32:27.120
girlfriend off the balcony?

32:27.120 --> 32:32.400
To be fair, she threw my dog off the balcony and I couldn't think of another option.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.280
I didn't realize it was puppy justice.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.000
Forgive me.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.640
This one, this is probably the best answer.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.600
Be happy she didn't throw you off the balcony.

32:42.600 --> 32:47.040
I wouldn't think it would be wise to start dating her again and your dog will appreciate

32:47.040 --> 32:48.040
that decision.

32:48.040 --> 32:49.040
Luck.

32:49.040 --> 32:54.600
Your dead dog will probably be real happy you don't date her again.

32:54.600 --> 32:57.800
It's not going to come back ghost dog style.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.080
I don't think you should date her again.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.520
I think it's probably time to cut the cord.

33:02.520 --> 33:03.520
Luck.

33:03.520 --> 33:04.520
Best of luck.

33:04.520 --> 33:08.320
If you're thinking about starting that relationship up again, I think it's gone.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.320
I think it's over.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.320
I think you're done.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.960
Andy, he's from Gmail.

33:12.960 --> 33:17.680
He recently started taking the bus to work in the morning because his company offered

33:17.680 --> 33:18.680
to pay for the pay.

33:18.680 --> 33:21.840
Really, guys, if you're just taking the bus, we don't need the backstory.

33:21.840 --> 33:22.840
You're taking the bus, okay?

33:22.840 --> 33:23.840
You're taking the bus.

33:23.840 --> 33:29.360
That means that I have about 35 minutes a day, twice a day, really, more to sit around

33:29.360 --> 33:31.720
and or stand than I used to.

33:31.720 --> 33:35.040
Aside from listening to fine podcasts that feature mackerel, how do you suggest I spend

33:35.040 --> 33:39.840
this extra time?

33:39.840 --> 33:42.760
Just make creepy eye contact with people on the bus.

33:42.760 --> 33:43.760
Try to hold their hands.

33:43.760 --> 33:44.760
It works anyway.

33:44.760 --> 33:52.200
You guys are going to think I'm goofy, but I've been reading this book that Travis got

33:52.200 --> 33:59.180
my wife, Sydney, about happiness and meditation and stuff.

33:59.180 --> 34:03.440
That seems like a really good opportunity to just take 10 of those minutes and just

34:03.440 --> 34:06.020
get centered.

34:06.020 --> 34:11.080
Think about your day, think about just relax, enjoy being alive.

34:11.080 --> 34:13.320
Enjoy being in a bus with a bunch of other people.

34:13.320 --> 34:16.900
Look at people, enjoy that they're alive, just appreciate your own life.

34:16.900 --> 34:17.900
Get centered.

34:17.900 --> 34:18.900
You don't have to be doing something.

34:18.900 --> 34:19.900
You know what?

34:19.900 --> 34:22.360
People misunderstand the idea of meditation and everything.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.400
It's really just thinking.

34:23.400 --> 34:24.400
You got 10 extra minutes.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.460
It's like, yeah, this is nice.

34:26.460 --> 34:28.200
This is a good moment to be.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.200
And just go with it.

34:29.200 --> 34:30.200
I'm glad you said that, Justin.

34:30.200 --> 34:31.200
You made me happy.

34:31.200 --> 34:32.200
See?

34:32.200 --> 34:33.200
It's all right.

34:33.200 --> 34:35.900
Let me afford another option.

34:35.900 --> 34:43.440
You could spend that 35 minutes preparing for a freestyle rap battle in your place of

34:43.440 --> 34:46.440
business, maybe jotting down some quick rhymes.

34:46.440 --> 34:53.000
You don't want to bust out a pre-prepare during an actual fight, but if you can get those

34:53.000 --> 34:59.560
gears cranked and start figuring out words that rhyme with other words, then I think

34:59.560 --> 35:07.080
that your freestyle rap battle win-loss ratio will ultimately improve.

35:07.080 --> 35:12.760
And then when you're riding home, you can still prepare for the next day's fight.

35:12.760 --> 35:17.600
Are you riding to a rap battle?

35:17.600 --> 35:20.080
He gives us information like he has a company offered to pay for the pass.

35:20.080 --> 35:24.020
He doesn't tell us whether or not he's taking the bus to a freestyle rap battle.

35:24.020 --> 35:26.240
It's all about the information, the specifics.

35:26.240 --> 35:31.520
If so, though, greatest company, they're like, hey, Steve, we know you got that rap

35:31.520 --> 35:32.520
battle later.

35:32.520 --> 35:33.520
We all got you this.

35:33.520 --> 35:37.520
We all chipped in to support your rap battling.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.960
Don't worry about that 290 fare.

35:38.960 --> 35:39.960
We got that.

35:39.960 --> 35:42.840
Why don't you worry about those dope rhymes instead?

35:42.840 --> 35:44.120
Don't even front, Steve.

35:44.120 --> 35:47.320
This one's all on us.

35:47.320 --> 35:52.480
Yahoo Answers user One-EyedW, and then it cuts off, and I'm going to, oh, it is One-EyedWilly.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.480
Don't worry, guys.

35:53.480 --> 35:54.480
It's One-EyedWilly.

35:54.480 --> 35:56.840
It says, can toenails be swallowed?

35:56.840 --> 35:57.840
Oh, no.

35:57.840 --> 36:01.760
I don't even want to talk about that one.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.880
It makes me sad.

36:03.880 --> 36:06.640
My wife told me she is leaving me because of my bad habits.

36:06.640 --> 36:08.480
I nearly choked on my own toenail.

36:08.480 --> 36:09.720
Is it okay to eat toenails?

36:09.720 --> 36:11.520
Fuck no, it's not One-EyedWilly.

36:11.520 --> 36:12.520
What's your deal?

36:12.520 --> 36:14.440
Hey, One-EyedWilly, you have a bigger problem.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.880
Your wife is leaving you because you won't stop eating your toenails.

36:16.880 --> 36:20.240
Remember earlier where you talked about grammar and how it should be flexible?

36:20.240 --> 36:25.560
This is one of those situations where that can and may thing is so important to this

36:25.560 --> 36:26.560
question.

36:26.560 --> 36:34.760
Like, I really, like, can you, obviously, obviously, yes, but may you, like, is that

36:34.760 --> 36:35.760
socially permissible?

36:35.760 --> 36:37.920
I'm going to have to say no.

36:37.920 --> 36:43.240
Well, I like that the question is not, should I put my toe in my mouth?

36:43.240 --> 36:49.120
It is, can I swallow it after I get that toenail off there, and I'm thinking about like how

36:49.120 --> 36:50.960
to dispense with it.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.960
Is that one of the options that I have available to me?

36:53.960 --> 37:01.720
His concern, I don't think, is coming from the cleanness of the habit or the fact that

37:01.720 --> 37:02.720
his wife is leaving him.

37:02.720 --> 37:09.920
I think he probably got worried when he choked on his own toenail, like he's worried if he

37:09.920 --> 37:10.920
keeps doing it.

37:10.920 --> 37:11.920
He's tempting fate.

37:11.920 --> 37:16.040
So, okay, so you don't think he was like, because I got the impression that he was going

37:16.040 --> 37:19.160
to be like, hey, dummy, look at what Yahoo Answers said.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.880
They said it's fine, so just sit down.

37:21.880 --> 37:25.060
Actually, there's only one safety.

37:25.060 --> 37:30.200
There is only one answer, and it's from Charlie H., and he says, yes, it is okay to eat toenails

37:30.200 --> 37:32.520
if you want to stay single and get fungal mouth.

37:32.520 --> 37:33.520
Charlie H.!

37:33.520 --> 37:34.520
Charlie H. out.

37:34.520 --> 37:37.520
The H stands for helping.

37:37.520 --> 37:44.120
So, I want to hear Griffin's last question, but the one we shall ruminate on for the week,

37:44.120 --> 37:46.800
and Travis, how can people get in touch with us?

37:46.800 --> 37:50.800
Oh, my God, a myriad of ways.

37:50.800 --> 38:02.520
The easiest way for all of our followers is probably the hashtag, MBMBAM, on the Twitter.

38:02.520 --> 38:12.040
We also have a Twitter account, at MBMBAM, and our FormSpring, MBMBAM on FormSpring.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.840
All of these ways will get a hold of us.

38:13.840 --> 38:19.000
Also, there's a Facebook group, which is full, like 130 people deep, so if you just

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
want to follow us.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.360
Mory Kyle, Kyle Collis, and Kyle Collis, thank you, everybody, for joining us.

38:24.360 --> 38:29.600
Seriously, please, oh, oh, oh, we're on iTunes, too, so if you could take just like two minutes

38:29.600 --> 38:36.760
and go review us, and subscribe and review us, that would be super appreciated.

38:36.760 --> 38:37.760
If you could...

38:37.760 --> 38:40.760
And the easiest way to find this all out is to go to MBMBAM.com.

38:40.760 --> 38:43.680
Yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.

38:43.680 --> 38:50.320
Final question of the day comes to us from Yahoo Answers user, I'm a Pokemon.

38:50.320 --> 38:55.760
The question is, is it okay to bring jelly beans on a plane?

38:55.760 --> 38:57.640
I'm Justin McElroy.

38:57.640 --> 38:58.640
I'm Travis McElroy.

38:58.640 --> 38:59.640
I'm Griffin McElroy.

38:59.640 --> 39:02.760
And this has been my brother, my brother.

39:02.760 --> 39:03.760
And me.

39:03.760 --> 39:21.720
I'm Travis McElroy, and I'm Griffin McElroy, and I'm Travis McElroy, and I'm Travis McElroy.

39:21.720 --> 39:36.840
I'm Travis McElroy, and I'm Travis McElroy, and I'm Travis McElroy.
