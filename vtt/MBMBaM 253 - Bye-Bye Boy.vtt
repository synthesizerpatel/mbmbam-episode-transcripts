00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.600
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me 2.0.

00:49.040 --> 00:53.840
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:54.400 --> 00:59.040
I'm Chaz and I've got a bone to pick with you because I'm a dog and dogs love bones.

00:59.040 --> 01:05.600
What were we thinking? What were we thinking? So, just to do a progress report.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.800
We have made a significant investment. For My Brother, My Brother and Me 2.0, we redid the

01:12.800 --> 01:20.800
studio. We did a huge, huge media blast. Huge media blast. Huge marketing push. Maybe you saw

01:20.800 --> 01:27.440
us in Jurassic World, the trailer. I think the biggest change, the biggest sacrifice

01:27.440 --> 01:32.880
that all, between all three of us, is that I had to go in and change the Twitter icon

01:33.920 --> 01:37.440
for My Brother, My Brother and Me. That was probably the biggest change that any of us did.

01:37.440 --> 01:40.800
Yeah, I mean, I was asleep during my dog body transformation where I got

01:40.800 --> 01:45.680
surgically turned into a dog. So, like, I didn't really feel it, you know?

01:45.680 --> 01:48.960
Well, I've had to spend a lot of time cleaning up after Griffin. Does that,

01:49.520 --> 01:53.040
does that count as a sacrifice? I mean, I do it out of love.

01:53.040 --> 01:59.360
Travis, give us the skinny on just how explosive the growth of My Brother, My Brother and Me 2.0 has

01:59.360 --> 02:09.520
been. Well, we've seen about a 0.00003% increase. So, that's like, so that's just one?

02:10.240 --> 02:12.640
Yeah, it was one guy. One guy?

02:12.640 --> 02:19.040
One guy who was, he was really into the Powerade stuff at first, and then he was like,

02:19.040 --> 02:25.040
okay, I get it. And then we kept doing it. And I was, I was sitting with him while he was listening

02:25.040 --> 02:30.320
to it. And he got turned off about halfway through. I should mention, I was going over

02:30.320 --> 02:33.840
our Powerade contract. I've got it here, hold on.

02:34.880 --> 02:46.720
Okay, if you turn to index J, and then codex B, and then indices 13 through 6,

02:46.720 --> 02:51.600
and it goes backwards, you'll actually see that they aren't paying us.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.560
There is no money involved.

02:54.560 --> 02:58.000
We read through the contract, and like the exclusivity, we looked at exclusivity,

02:58.000 --> 03:01.200
like, yes, yes, yes. They're like, you don't have to mention the forbidden flavors. We're like,

03:01.200 --> 03:03.440
good, because we wouldn't peddle that to our listeners.

03:03.440 --> 03:07.760
Yeah, no long pork flavor. We don't talk about the long pork flavor.

03:07.760 --> 03:12.720
Right, but what we didn't do was look over the contract for an index or a codex that mentions

03:12.720 --> 03:20.560
restitution. Well, I just, I just like signed a lease on a sports car that's branded with

03:20.560 --> 03:25.440
like Powerade down the side and on the hood. Yeah, and they're not, no, that's not, you're

03:25.440 --> 03:28.560
paying for that. Yeah, they're actually taking money out of our pockets. So why,

03:28.560 --> 03:34.160
God, did we sign on for a three-year deal? We have a three-year deal with Powerade,

03:34.160 --> 03:40.880
and they're getting us coming and going. Yeah, so I don't think we can abandon My Brother,

03:40.880 --> 03:44.880
My Brother, and Me 2.0. We are legally into this, legally speaking.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.240
So welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me 2.0.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.840
Boys in the house, get it?

03:51.840 --> 03:55.680
Sorry, sorry, sorry, let's do it right. Powerade presents My Brother, My Brother,

03:55.680 --> 03:58.400
and Me 2.0. A Powerade experience.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.760
A Powerade experience. Ride the lightning.

04:01.760 --> 04:05.760
I have to, I have to read this bit they have here. Make sure,

04:05.760 --> 04:13.200
make sure to listen to the show on your Barnes and Noble Nook to get special enhanced media

04:14.080 --> 04:23.920
cross-play features like a Catch the Chazz minigame and also complimentary coupons for

04:23.920 --> 04:28.240
Powerade. Just an important question. Yeah. Does Powerade make the Nook?

04:29.280 --> 04:34.000
Get yourself electrolyte blasted and then maybe dig into crime and police.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.320
Then maybe dig into crime and punishment.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.960
They have a co-sponsorship deal. It's a transmedia.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.760
It makes complete sense when you think about it.

04:43.760 --> 04:47.120
It does. There's a, there's no overlap there so that it can be.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.440
All right, let's just get on with the fucking show.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.760
Let's just do the show and maybe focus on our core competencies and just,

04:53.760 --> 04:55.920
I need some, some level of distraction.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.160
There will be some wet stunts.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.360
Yeah, I'm fine with the wet stunts. We're just not getting paid fucking anything for it.

05:03.360 --> 05:06.160
This, this, this podcast was an important revenue stream for me.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.200
Well done, worth it.

05:08.080 --> 05:12.240
No, because I spent $300,000 on this inflatable obstacle course.

05:12.960 --> 05:13.600
Justin bought-

05:13.600 --> 05:15.280
No one told you to do that, Justin.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.680
Justin bought the wipeout obstacle course because he said,

05:17.680 --> 05:20.880
quote, I want to get really good at the wipeout obstacle course.

05:20.880 --> 05:24.320
And he spent $200,000 on the blob from the movie Heavyweights.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.880
Once again, no one told you to do, Justin.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.480
Yeah. Also not worth $200,000.

05:29.200 --> 05:29.680
Like maybe-

05:29.680 --> 05:30.720
Well, that's debatable.

05:30.720 --> 05:31.200
Maybe six-

05:31.200 --> 05:32.000
It's a piece of history.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.080
Okay. Let's, uh, let's get on it.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.320
Uh, my husband has a-

05:36.320 --> 05:37.040
Wait, on the blob?

05:37.680 --> 05:41.120
Yeah, oh yeah, sorry. All, all episodes of the podcast will now be recorded on the blob.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.800
My husband has a terrible habit of removing his socks.

05:44.800 --> 05:48.240
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, whee!

05:48.240 --> 05:49.120
That was me on the blob.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.280
Sorry, I jumped on and flipped Griffin into the lake.

05:52.640 --> 05:53.760
It's full of Powerade.

05:57.120 --> 06:01.200
The worst part is if he's in the living room, the mosquitoes are terrible.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.920
It's a stagnant lake of Powerade.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.640
I couldn't hear the question because I was flying through the air away from you.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.880
Don't interrupt me!

06:09.600 --> 06:13.280
And don't make any more wipeout specific references, I won't get them.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.560
My brother has a terrible habit of removing his socks all over the house.

06:17.120 --> 06:21.040
The worst part is if he's in the living room, he stuffs them between the couch cushions.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.120
Do you do weird things like this to annoy your wives?

06:25.120 --> 06:28.080
Oh, that annoy your wives, not specifically intended to annoy your wives.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.440
Oh, that was a way different-

06:29.440 --> 06:32.240
And what have they done to cope or get you to stop?

06:32.240 --> 06:34.000
And that's from Help Brothers.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Please tell me how to restore my wedded bliss.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.680
This is from House of Socks in Houston.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.040
I don't think I have anything, you know?

06:41.040 --> 06:42.400
I'm pretty much...

06:42.400 --> 06:44.480
No, I do this.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.560
So this one I have.

06:46.560 --> 06:47.920
Okay, is this a universal thing?

06:48.800 --> 06:49.520
Oh, I do this.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.520
I take myself off everywhere.

06:52.400 --> 06:56.080
It is weird how like in your day to day, no matter what you are doing,

06:56.080 --> 06:59.760
getting to that point where you're like, what is with these fucking socks?

06:59.760 --> 07:00.160
Yeah.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.920
Why am I wearing these bad boys?

07:01.920 --> 07:02.960
I gotta get these off.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.200
I will also often only take one off.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.880
And like, it's not like I do that on purpose.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.040
Like I'll take one off and then get distracted by something

07:09.040 --> 07:12.800
and realize like 45 minutes later, I just have one sock on

07:12.800 --> 07:14.880
and I have no idea what the other one is.

07:14.880 --> 07:20.400
I think of it as like being a sock farmer, where come the winter seasons,

07:20.400 --> 07:24.080
I will have a harvest where I'm sitting in the living room with my wife,

07:24.080 --> 07:27.360
watching Orphan Black and I'm like, oh, I've got cold feet.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.880
I don't want to go into the bedroom though, where I keep my socks normally.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.640
I wish I had a secret stash.

07:32.640 --> 07:36.240
And then lo and behold, secret stash is right there waiting for me.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.760
Now they're a little dry.

07:37.760 --> 07:40.720
But you know, in the winter, you got to get the preserved stuff.

07:40.720 --> 07:41.520
You know what I mean?

07:41.520 --> 07:43.680
Maybe you've brined them.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.160
Yeah, it's sock jerky, essentially, is what you're making.

07:46.160 --> 07:49.200
I think everybody has things like this in their life.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.760
I mean, I know I have my own little quirks.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.760
I leave the toilet seat up.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.760
I make love to men and women other than my wife.

07:55.760 --> 08:00.000
I leave the cabinets open at every turn.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.760
I think that, you know, it's part of the adjustment of living with another person.

08:03.760 --> 08:04.240
Yeah, everyone's got fun stuff.

08:04.240 --> 08:08.080
I just make love too good, you know, and my wife's so annoyed.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.280
She's like, oh, stop making love so good all the time.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.480
Yeah, like I leave glasses of water around the house so much

08:14.480 --> 08:16.560
that I'm basically like the little girl from Signs

08:16.560 --> 08:19.760
and also I've been siphoning funds out of my wife's retirement account

08:19.760 --> 08:22.320
to buy myself crack and then I smoke all the crack.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.200
And then sometimes I like don't do the dishes.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.200
Yeah, it's hard.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.520
That's what marriage is like learning to love the fact

08:31.520 --> 08:34.000
that your husband is gaslighting you slowly.

08:34.000 --> 08:34.800
You know what I mean?

08:34.800 --> 08:36.720
It's like, yeah, you're going insane,

08:36.720 --> 08:40.240
but maybe it's like you grow old and insane together.

08:40.240 --> 08:45.040
Yeah, the problem with voicing these concerns

08:45.040 --> 08:47.760
are that like if my wife says to me,

08:47.760 --> 08:51.920
hey, fucking with the cabinets, seriously, stop it.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.280
Because mom used to get on us.

08:53.280 --> 08:53.840
Do you remember that?

08:53.840 --> 08:56.000
Like mom would get on our case about this constantly

08:56.000 --> 08:58.320
because we would go into the kitchen and leave every cabinet open

08:58.320 --> 08:59.680
and then just walk out.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.360
So like this has been a recurring problem.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.640
And so Sydney will bring this up to me

09:04.640 --> 09:09.520
and I'll like the danger of that is I'll remember to close cabinets

09:09.520 --> 09:11.520
and expect a fucking medal for it.

09:11.520 --> 09:12.880
Yeah, like, hey, check.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.960
Hey, did you notice any cabinets today?

09:16.560 --> 09:19.280
Do you think anything special in the kitchen?

09:19.280 --> 09:23.760
Did you cook something special for me?

09:23.760 --> 09:28.400
No, I just didn't fuck up as bad as I actually do.

09:28.400 --> 09:28.960
Treat please.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.480
I do the socks things constantly.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.000
God, this is so annoying.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.280
I do, I leave them.

09:33.280 --> 09:37.120
But I usually like, I put the socks in a place

09:37.120 --> 09:39.280
where it could theoretically,

09:39.280 --> 09:43.360
like if you were a severely disturbed person

09:43.360 --> 09:45.200
could be the place where you put socks.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.720
Like I will drape them over the arm of the couch

09:48.720 --> 09:50.880
like, oh no, that was intentional.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.320
This is where I meant to put the socks.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.480
These, it's so they were in eyesight.

09:54.480 --> 09:55.600
So I would get them later.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.160
I would say, oh yeah, these socks.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.920
I do a thing where I take my socks off

09:59.920 --> 10:01.280
after I ride the exercise bike,

10:01.280 --> 10:02.400
which we keep in the living room,

10:02.400 --> 10:05.280
watch our property brothers while I bike

10:05.280 --> 10:07.760
and then just grind it out and try to drop some LBs.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.160
And then I got off the bike and I'm like, sweaty socks,

10:10.160 --> 10:11.760
take them off and throw them on the floor.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.280
And I know that Rachel's like,

10:13.920 --> 10:15.600
I would prefer those not to be there.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.120
But in my mind, it's like,

10:17.120 --> 10:21.040
I just worked out, like I earned this.

10:21.840 --> 10:22.640
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

10:23.360 --> 10:23.680
Please.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.560
Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kansky.

10:27.440 --> 10:28.160
Thank you, Zoe.

10:28.160 --> 10:28.640
It's by Yahoo.

10:28.640 --> 10:29.360
Climbing that ladder.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.320
Yeah, I almost said,

10:30.320 --> 10:32.400
I almost just like let her rip with a nickname.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.840
Well, her kind of thing is climbing that ladder.

10:35.840 --> 10:36.720
Climbing that ladder.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.000
Well, but then what if she's on top?

10:38.000 --> 10:38.960
Then it's, we're being-

10:39.680 --> 10:41.120
Falling off that ladder.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.160
Falling off.

10:42.160 --> 10:42.960
Falling off that ladder,

10:42.960 --> 10:44.800
but grabbing back onto it at the last second.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.160
But now she's about midway down,

10:46.160 --> 10:47.120
got to climb her way back up.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.880
Top of the ladder, about six rungs up.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.520
Okay, wait, quick aside.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.560
I was listening to a clip

10:53.280 --> 10:55.120
that somebody had posted on YouTube

10:55.120 --> 10:56.240
of My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

10:56.240 --> 10:58.000
because I thought it was just called

10:58.000 --> 10:59.440
My Brother, My Brother, and Me extra bit.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.200
And I thought maybe it was something funny

11:01.200 --> 11:01.920
that I had done.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.520
And I needed to brighten my day a little bit.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.840
So I thought, oh, man, that would feel good.

11:05.840 --> 11:06.640
And I listened to it.

11:06.640 --> 11:07.920
It was just a bit where we were like

11:07.920 --> 11:09.280
calling people's names out at the end

11:09.280 --> 11:10.320
for tweeting about the show.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.760
Do you remember when we used to do this?

11:11.760 --> 11:14.480
This is like episode 150, if I remember correctly.

11:14.480 --> 11:17.840
So over, like basically over two years ago.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.800
And one of the names I thanked for tweeting about us

11:20.800 --> 11:22.240
was Drew Davenport.

11:22.240 --> 11:27.040
That dude has been on the bus for so long,

11:27.040 --> 11:28.560
much longer than I realized.

11:28.560 --> 11:32.640
And he wasn't the Drew Davenport back then.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.840
He had to listen.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.280
He was odd, Drew Davenport.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.600
One of multiple Drew Davenports.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.600
Sorry, Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.960
Let me get that Yahoo from you.

11:40.960 --> 11:44.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user Benjamin C, who asks,

11:44.560 --> 11:46.480
is Mountain Dew screwing with my head

11:46.480 --> 11:47.840
and increasing my sex drive?

11:50.000 --> 11:50.640
Hey, guys.

11:50.640 --> 11:51.360
Smiley face.

11:51.920 --> 11:55.680
OK, so I had my first bottle of Mountain Dew

11:55.680 --> 11:57.280
about five days ago.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.360
Since then, I've been having like one to two

11:59.360 --> 12:01.520
500 milliliter bottles a day.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.720
Just today, my girlfriend said,

12:04.720 --> 12:06.800
I've been acting weird slash different.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.920
I'm only 16, but apparently my sex drive has increased.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.920
And I've become, quote, cocky.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.200
Cocky means cheeky, saying things that are risky

12:15.200 --> 12:16.560
that I usually wouldn't say.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.520
I think that's what it means anyway.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.120
Thanks, Merriam-Webster.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.960
I think that's what it means anyway.

12:22.960 --> 12:27.280
So do you guys think it's OK to do with the do?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.440
I'm English, by the way.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.160
So the do only just recently arrived.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.520
Man, I love this stuff.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.360
But depending on what you guys think,

12:35.360 --> 12:37.360
I reckon I'll quit doing the do.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.400
What do you think?

12:38.400 --> 12:38.960
Thanks.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.080
And then just to bookend it, another smiley face.

12:42.800 --> 12:48.080
OK, one, I love anybody who says cocky.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.320
Oh, you probably don't know what that means.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.360
Here's what it means.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.280
Anyway, that's what I think it means.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.240
God, if only there was some way to figure it out for sure.

12:56.960 --> 13:00.320
Griffin, is it possible that this is a Mountain Dew

13:00.320 --> 13:04.320
buzz marketing like British thing where they're like,

13:04.320 --> 13:06.320
I guess it made me sex too good?

13:07.040 --> 13:08.640
I don't know, you guys.

13:08.640 --> 13:09.680
You should check it out.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.760
I drink like two bottles of it a day.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.280
It just got here to England.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.360
It's this new thing called Mountain Dew

13:15.360 --> 13:17.600
that apparently makes your sex real good.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.720
It's amazing to me.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.920
The amazing thing to me is that this shit's just now

13:21.920 --> 13:25.120
getting over to the aisles, as I call them.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.840
Well, it had to go on the ships.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.320
Yeah, and they got lost.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.760
There's two reasons why I find this wonderful is,

13:33.760 --> 13:36.400
first of all, the fact that it only just arrived,

13:36.400 --> 13:39.680
this venerable brand that I wish we had picked up

13:39.680 --> 13:42.640
instead of Powerade, probably the same company owns them.

13:42.640 --> 13:47.040
Anyway, this means I intimate from this knowledge

13:47.600 --> 13:52.160
that there has been somebody or a group of people

13:52.160 --> 13:55.440
in the aisles that have been just viciously fighting

13:55.440 --> 13:57.280
to keep Mountain Dew off their shores.

13:57.280 --> 14:00.720
Just their scenes of them just like dumping it into a harbor.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.360
Or just like maybe there's some politicking,

14:03.360 --> 14:06.080
some embargoes, trade embargoes going on.

14:06.080 --> 14:09.520
Just to keep this neon power juice out of the-

14:09.520 --> 14:13.280
Mr. Prime Minister, we will not do that dew.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.320
We don't do it.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.160
Except they have a British accent.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.240
The second thing, though, is it makes sense to me

14:18.240 --> 14:21.680
all of a sudden why British people drink so much tea

14:21.680 --> 14:22.720
that's not good.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.760
Like they drink not great tea most of the time.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.120
And it's just because they haven't,

14:27.120 --> 14:31.200
like other better beverages just aren't available yet.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.560
But they're coming around now,

14:32.560 --> 14:36.000
and pretty soon it's gonna be dew in a biscuit, love.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.880
It's 5.30.

14:38.000 --> 14:38.720
It's dew time.

14:38.720 --> 14:39.120
Dew time.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.560
It's dew time, baby.

14:40.560 --> 14:41.520
It's 5.30.

14:41.520 --> 14:42.560
Dew in a biscuit, love.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.680
Well, that trickle down here,

14:45.680 --> 14:48.160
we have to start calling our smallest tablespoons,

14:48.960 --> 14:50.240
will we call them dew spoons?

14:50.240 --> 14:51.440
Dew spoons, yes, exactly.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.200
Three dew spoons of olive oil.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.240
And when you put your balls in another person's mouth,

14:56.240 --> 14:57.440
you're dew bagging them, yes.

14:58.240 --> 14:58.960
That is-

14:58.960 --> 15:03.840
Right wing conservatives will be called dew partiers,

15:03.840 --> 15:05.440
and that sounds amazing to me.

15:05.440 --> 15:07.280
Ooh, I would join that group.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.800
I would join that group in a heartbeat.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.680
I think part of the problem that I'm having

15:11.680 --> 15:13.440
answering this question authoritatively,

15:13.440 --> 15:14.480
which I would love to do,

15:15.600 --> 15:17.920
is that they did not specify

15:17.920 --> 15:20.480
what flavor of Mountain Dew they were drinking.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.400
And as I'm about to fill you guys in on,

15:24.400 --> 15:28.080
there are 69 different flavors of Mountain Dew

15:28.080 --> 15:29.200
they could be in piping.

15:29.200 --> 15:29.760
69.

15:30.640 --> 15:31.760
Yeah, nice.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.640
They have to stop there.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.600
They can never make another-

15:33.600 --> 15:36.240
Or a race is the most extreme number, gentlemen.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.320
We shan't make a new dew.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.920
So I'd like to hit you guys with a few flavors,

15:41.920 --> 15:43.840
and you tell me if they are real or fake.

15:43.840 --> 15:44.480
Ooh, okay.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.960
I like to call dew or no dew.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.280
There is no try.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.880
That's a good name.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.800
No, he's doing a deal or no deal thing.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.520
Oh, I see.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.160
Okay, I got you.

15:54.160 --> 15:54.720
Yeah.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.220
Yeah.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.200
So here's my first one.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.400
Okay.

15:59.360 --> 16:02.160
Mountain Dew, Johnson City Gold.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.120
Don't waste my time.

16:04.160 --> 16:04.960
Okay.

16:04.960 --> 16:05.520
Is that real?

16:05.520 --> 16:05.680
No.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.360
No, that's real.

16:07.920 --> 16:12.880
It's a flavor variant with part of a regional dew promotion,

16:12.880 --> 16:15.360
and it's a distinctive malt-flavored soda

16:15.360 --> 16:16.320
from the creators of Mountain Dew.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.600
Oh my God.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.720
Malt-flavored distinct-

16:18.720 --> 16:20.400
It would be distinctive.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.600
It would be an unforgettable experience.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.640
This is just like all those other malt-flavored sodas.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.320
Dewitos.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.040
Mountain Dew Dewitos.

16:29.680 --> 16:30.720
I'm gonna say that's real.

16:31.760 --> 16:32.800
What would you think it is?

16:32.800 --> 16:33.920
Dorito flavored.

16:34.640 --> 16:35.280
Correct.

16:35.280 --> 16:35.920
It is real.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.000
It was tested on college campuses in 2014.

16:38.800 --> 16:39.360
Oh my God.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.760
Mountain Dew Frigid Blast.

16:41.760 --> 16:42.640
No, that's not real.

16:42.640 --> 16:43.760
You stumbled over it.

16:43.760 --> 16:44.560
I made that one up.

16:44.560 --> 16:44.720
Yeah.

16:45.280 --> 16:48.080
Mountain Dew Thin Ice Freeze.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.040
That one, yes.

16:51.040 --> 16:51.520
I'm gonna go real.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.600
Maybe like as a Happy Feet promotion.

16:53.600 --> 16:57.520
Dragon fruit, acai, and pomegranate flavors.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.400
Of course.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.200
That's what I want.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.120
Excuse me, sir.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.080
Do you have this on tap?

17:03.280 --> 17:06.640
Mountain Dew Cryptonite Ice.

17:06.640 --> 17:06.880
Yeah.

17:06.880 --> 17:07.840
That's real.

17:07.840 --> 17:08.080
For sure.

17:08.080 --> 17:08.960
That's super real.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.920
There is a lot of flavors of Mountain Dew,

17:11.920 --> 17:14.480
and they are not as funny to read as I thought they would be.

17:14.480 --> 17:14.800
No, they never are.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.640
Is there one that's like Crystal Dew?

17:16.640 --> 17:19.040
I feel like somebody sent that to us recently.

17:19.040 --> 17:23.680
Yeah, and that's the one that tastes like Crystal Bernard's sweat.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.200
Then the original tagline for that was,

17:29.200 --> 17:30.400
it'll give you wings,

17:30.400 --> 17:32.960
but then fucking Red Bull chomped that flavor.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.120
They had to change it to,

17:35.120 --> 17:36.720
it'll make you watch wings.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.120
It'll make you-

17:37.120 --> 17:37.600
There's one.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.440
Mountain Dew Grape.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.400
No, no, there was Mountain Dew-

17:44.400 --> 17:45.840
Then there's parentheses,

17:45.840 --> 17:49.360
think of better title later.

17:49.360 --> 17:53.120
It is only available in 12 ounce cans

17:53.120 --> 17:54.720
in certain Japanese vending machines.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.520
Bill, will you punch this up later?

17:57.520 --> 17:58.560
Thanks, Tim.

17:58.560 --> 17:58.880
Thanks.

17:59.680 --> 18:03.280
Maybe like pre-wine juice blast or something?

18:03.280 --> 18:03.680
I don't know.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.800
I'm thinking maybe like extreme mountain splash.

18:06.800 --> 18:07.280
I don't know.

18:07.280 --> 18:08.240
You'll think of something.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.360
You're a genius.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.560
So this is weird.

18:10.560 --> 18:14.000
One of the Yahoo's I picked out for us to do on this episode

18:14.000 --> 18:17.360
was actually a quiz about monster energy flavors.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.200
And I'm wondering if I should just jettison that

18:19.200 --> 18:20.160
into the archives.

18:22.720 --> 18:22.960
No.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.760
You should actually probably do it right now.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.680
Yeah, you should do it right now.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.360
Quiz flip, flipping the quiz.

18:30.160 --> 18:30.880
Quiz flip.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.640
I have some monster energy flavors

18:32.640 --> 18:34.720
based on this Yahoo sent in by Chase Greenlee.

18:34.720 --> 18:35.520
Thank you, Chase.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.520
Asked by Yahoo Answers user invisible,

18:37.520 --> 18:38.320
they're gone, they're dead.

18:39.200 --> 18:39.840
But they asked,

18:39.840 --> 18:42.000
what are all the monster energy flavors?

18:42.000 --> 18:45.040
And Yahoo Answers user also not available.

18:45.680 --> 18:46.480
Man, Yahoo.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.240
You need to get your fucking website right.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.800
Reply with a whole bunch of stuff.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.040
And I'm just going to hit you with some of them

18:53.040 --> 18:54.400
and you tell me if they're real or not.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.360
In a game we like to call do or no do too.

18:58.000 --> 18:58.800
This is my guess.

18:59.360 --> 18:59.600
Yeah.

19:00.480 --> 19:05.920
Frankenberry, boo berry, fruit brute, yummy mummy, chocolate.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.640
No, these are beverages that are drank by DJs

19:08.640 --> 19:10.640
to help them fucking party harder.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.800
How about a monster assault?

19:12.800 --> 19:13.920
Yeah, I think that's real.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.360
Yeah, monster low carb.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.320
Yeah, it's real.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.360
Yeah, that one's real.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.560
Monster mixed.

19:19.280 --> 19:19.840
Real.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.040
No, no, not real.

19:21.040 --> 19:21.840
That's right, Justin.

19:21.840 --> 19:22.400
It's not real.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.400
Now monster mixed with two X's.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.640
Real.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.320
Yeah, that one's on point.

19:30.320 --> 19:31.760
How about monster rehab?

19:32.640 --> 19:33.360
Real.

19:33.360 --> 19:34.720
Yeah, that's a whole chain.

19:34.720 --> 19:38.160
They got tea lemonade and energy flavor,

19:38.160 --> 19:39.880
which I guess now is due to the

19:39.880 --> 19:42.320
I guess now is due lemonade and energy.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.000
It's a delicious cocktail.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.600
Is it supposed to be like can you have a hangover?

19:45.600 --> 19:46.320
Is that the idea?

19:46.320 --> 19:47.440
It's anti-monster.

19:47.440 --> 19:50.320
It nullifies the monster already coursing through your veins

19:50.320 --> 19:51.680
poisoning you from within.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.080
It's basically liquid silver.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.680
How about monster hitman?

19:56.880 --> 19:57.920
Oh, yes.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.800
Yeah, that's another chain of flavors there.

20:00.800 --> 20:05.920
Monster shots, three fluid ounces of straight party juice.

20:07.200 --> 20:07.920
Monster hitman.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.560
When you only have a short break in between the two records

20:10.560 --> 20:12.080
you're playing as a party DJ.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.960
Right, there's monster hitman regular who and if you drink

20:14.960 --> 20:19.440
that you're an idiot because you should instead jump on

20:19.440 --> 20:22.720
monster hitman lobo and monster hitman sniper.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.440
Monster hitman sniper.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.800
Monster hitman sniper was the name of a product that

20:28.800 --> 20:32.240
monster created and they said we need a name for this

20:32.240 --> 20:35.200
horrible poison shot and someone said monster hitman

20:35.200 --> 20:38.160
sniper and they said you just said three different words

20:38.800 --> 20:42.160
that are sounds scary and of course that's what we're

20:42.160 --> 20:42.880
going to name it.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.400
Happy birthday, Robert.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.440
This is your present.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.840
We're going to go with your bad bad idea that you came up

20:47.840 --> 20:49.120
with at this monster meeting.

20:49.120 --> 20:54.480
Monster hitman sniper sounds like the translated Japanese

20:54.480 --> 20:56.080
title that Die Hard would have.

20:56.080 --> 20:59.200
Yeah, that's what they call it in Japan.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.080
There's some crazy shit up in here.

21:02.080 --> 21:06.160
Expresso, monster, hammer, it's just like we need three words.

21:06.160 --> 21:09.600
How about ex-presso, monster, and hammer?

21:09.600 --> 21:10.160
Yeah, cool.

21:10.160 --> 21:10.880
Why not?

21:10.880 --> 21:14.320
Hey, there's also Italian cafe monster.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.480
There's Vienna monster.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.960
Remember that waiter, Jean-Luc?

21:18.960 --> 21:21.520
And he did that sick kick flip over the table.

21:22.160 --> 21:25.120
Hey, let me hit you with karate chop my lawn chair now.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.200
How about this laser monster sword?

21:27.200 --> 21:29.920
Well, yeah, let's just, yeah, laser monster sword, sure.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.400
And again, as long as we get monster in there,

21:32.400 --> 21:35.360
the other two words just have to sound radical.

21:35.360 --> 21:38.000
Hey, how about jetpack monster monster?

21:38.000 --> 21:39.200
So two monsters?

21:39.200 --> 21:41.040
Yeah, but like the second one's not the brand.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.320
It's like an actual monster.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.200
How about mother of all monsters?

21:45.200 --> 21:46.080
That's pretty good, too.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.240
How about monster monster monster?

21:50.960 --> 21:53.520
I'm currently 17 years old and just got out of high school,

21:53.520 --> 21:54.800
but not by graduating.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.040
That is a cool thing to say.

21:57.040 --> 22:02.960
Hey, wow, why am I not asking this person for advice?

22:02.960 --> 22:05.680
I will be 18 this August when I start looking for a job

22:05.680 --> 22:08.880
and save it for deposit on a place once I turn 18.

22:08.880 --> 22:14.400
I'm just looking for some advice as far as general

22:14.400 --> 22:15.680
how to be an adult advice.

22:16.320 --> 22:20.160
And that's from a boy as dry as a popcorn fart in Atlanta.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.520
This is crazy.

22:23.520 --> 22:29.280
This is a crazy thing you've asked us.

22:29.280 --> 22:33.440
We've made a fucking podcast empire out of drip feeding

22:33.440 --> 22:34.640
these answers to people.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.320
And you want us to just close up shop

22:36.320 --> 22:39.600
and have a going a fire sale on adult advice?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.160
You're partying 24, Sev.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.080
You're the coolest person I've ever met.

22:46.880 --> 22:51.280
How about I ask you how to get her done constantly?

22:51.280 --> 22:54.240
Is that a thing that you ask people?

22:54.240 --> 22:55.920
I don't think that Larry the K-Gry

22:55.920 --> 22:59.200
has ever made it a question how to get her done.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.040
Well, I guess nobody in the audience

23:01.040 --> 23:03.600
has ever been brave enough to ask.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.560
Sorry, sorry, stop the show.

23:06.560 --> 23:07.360
Stop the show.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.640
What do you mean by that?

23:10.960 --> 23:13.120
You know, compadre, you just get her done.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.000
Yeah, you said it.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.360
You can't just keep saying it.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.240
Well, I mean, I can.

23:18.240 --> 23:20.720
I'm legally bound to three times a minute.

23:20.720 --> 23:21.760
No, this is the thing.

23:21.760 --> 23:24.800
What you guys don't know is if somebody asks that question,

23:24.800 --> 23:27.280
Larry the K-Gry is able to remove his hat,

23:27.280 --> 23:29.280
revert back to the human being he was,

23:29.280 --> 23:31.120
and then the person who asked the question

23:31.120 --> 23:33.520
has to take over as Larry the K-Gry.

23:33.520 --> 23:34.400
When they put the hat on,

23:34.400 --> 23:36.080
they become Larry the K-Gry

23:36.080 --> 23:38.880
until they're able to eventually solve the riddle

23:38.880 --> 23:40.400
of how to get her done.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.960
Or pass the curse along to the next person.

23:42.960 --> 23:47.120
What you just described is a mirror universe version

23:47.120 --> 23:49.120
of the plot of Tooth Fairy,

23:49.120 --> 23:51.440
which Lawrence the Cable Gentleman is also in.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.680
Yeah, well, that's where they got the idea.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.400
For Larry the Cable Guy?

23:56.400 --> 23:57.600
No, Larry the Cable Guy said,

23:57.600 --> 23:59.440
I got an idea for a movie.

23:59.440 --> 24:02.080
It's like this horrible hellscape that I'm trapped in.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.680
What if there's a blue-collar comedian

24:05.680 --> 24:10.160
who was every day his whole existence was a pain scape

24:10.160 --> 24:13.600
from which he never received any relief?

24:13.600 --> 24:16.160
And he missed the days when he was a neurosurgeon

24:16.160 --> 24:17.840
without an accent.

24:17.840 --> 24:21.040
I used to be a patent lawyer in Rhode Island.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.400
I had a wife and kids.

24:22.400 --> 24:25.440
I haven't seen them in 12 painful years.

24:25.440 --> 24:28.000
And I guess what I'm saying is get her done.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.480
Wink, wink, hint, hint, nudge, nudge.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.400
Boy, that sure makes you curious, doesn't it?

24:34.080 --> 24:38.560
You could be 27th in the line of cablemen.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.640
A proud tradition of pain.

24:42.640 --> 24:46.640
I mean, what if at the end of the Santa Claus,

24:46.640 --> 24:51.120
Tim Allen was just freed and he's walking out the door

24:51.120 --> 24:54.640
of Santa Claus HQ at the North Pole

24:54.640 --> 24:56.880
and he's like, oh my God, I'm gonna get out there

24:56.880 --> 24:58.160
and live my life.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.520
I'm finally free of this curse.

24:59.520 --> 25:02.800
And the last scene after the credits as he's leaving

25:02.800 --> 25:04.480
is he summons across Larry the Cable Guy

25:04.480 --> 25:06.960
who just stares at him and is like, get her done.

25:06.960 --> 25:09.840
And Tim Allen, as though driven

25:09.840 --> 25:11.920
by some otherworldly force, asks him,

25:11.920 --> 25:13.200
what do you mean get her done?

25:13.200 --> 25:15.200
And it's just the cycle begins anew,

25:15.200 --> 25:16.240
except this time he's Larry the Cable Guy.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.880
Oh, so the last shot is just Larry the Cable Guy's face

25:18.880 --> 25:20.120
lighting up.

25:20.120 --> 25:20.960
Exactly.

25:24.160 --> 25:25.720
So adult advice.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.680
I think there's something in there, right?

25:30.680 --> 25:34.320
My number one piece of adult advice is to,

25:35.440 --> 25:39.600
whenever a new scenario, like how to get health insurance,

25:39.600 --> 25:43.760
paying bills, whenever a scenario like that presents itself,

25:43.760 --> 25:46.960
just do it, learn how to do it, educate yourself on it,

25:46.960 --> 25:49.840
rather than trying to dance around it

25:49.840 --> 25:53.240
until eventually at 25 you have to deal with it.

25:53.240 --> 25:56.440
Because if at 18 you can really start to wrap your mind

25:56.440 --> 26:01.440
around all of the minutia of how to day-to-day deal

26:02.200 --> 26:05.320
with adult life, you'll be so far ahead of the curve.

26:05.320 --> 26:06.960
There's stuff I didn't learn how to do

26:06.960 --> 26:10.320
until I was like 23 or 24 that I should have been doing

26:10.320 --> 26:11.720
so far ahead of that.

26:13.120 --> 26:15.000
Is it fucked up to say go back to high school

26:15.000 --> 26:16.120
and just finish it?

26:16.120 --> 26:18.160
You got so close.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.320
You got so close.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.240
I mean, I get it.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.200
I get it, I get it, it's the worst.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.920
But you are so close, it breaks my heart

26:24.920 --> 26:27.640
that you put in 17 of the 18 years

26:27.640 --> 26:30.280
that you gotta do to finish it.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.840
And if you finish it, I feel like it's gonna be

26:31.840 --> 26:33.000
a lot easier for you out there.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.840
At the very least, just take the test for the GED.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.200
Yeah, you can do it.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.400
It's super easy.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.460
It's probably super hard.

26:40.460 --> 26:42.640
I probably couldn't pass the GED test now.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.480
No question.

26:43.480 --> 26:44.300
No question about it.

26:44.300 --> 26:45.140
I would fail that test.

26:45.140 --> 26:45.960
I barely passed my driver's test.

26:45.960 --> 26:46.780
Yeah.

26:46.780 --> 26:47.620
No question.

26:47.620 --> 26:51.280
I drive my little sister Riley from school sometimes

26:51.280 --> 26:52.840
and I ask her, so what'd you learn today?

26:52.840 --> 26:56.720
And she starts describing things that I feel like

26:56.720 --> 26:57.760
my brain is melting.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.840
Like trigamom.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.680
Trig?

27:00.680 --> 27:04.280
Trigam, yeah, I remember that, this is good.

27:04.280 --> 27:07.220
No, I could not process it anymore.

27:07.220 --> 27:08.120
Couldn't handle it.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.520
Especially, you know what I definitely couldn't handle

27:10.520 --> 27:12.520
anymore, why I could not do it, this person's doing it?

27:12.520 --> 27:15.960
I could not handle being in a room for an hour and a half

27:15.960 --> 27:18.120
and also I have to eat lunch at like 10.30

27:18.120 --> 27:20.440
or some crazy time and I have to be in a room

27:20.440 --> 27:22.060
for an hour and a half listening to a person

27:22.060 --> 27:25.480
and I can't just like, well, I'm an adult, bye, walk out.

27:25.480 --> 27:29.940
That power is what guides me through every situation

27:29.940 --> 27:30.780
in my life.

27:30.780 --> 27:32.100
Even if I'm gonna sit and listen to somebody

27:32.100 --> 27:34.480
for an hour and a half, I know I have the power.

27:34.480 --> 27:35.880
To not learn.

27:35.880 --> 27:36.720
To not learn.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.680
To defiantly unlearn things.

27:38.680 --> 27:39.800
To unlearn.

27:39.800 --> 27:40.880
Go back to school.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.280
Go back to school or don't.

27:42.280 --> 27:43.760
Or don't, whatever.

27:43.760 --> 27:46.160
If you're not gonna go back to school, learn a martial art

27:46.160 --> 27:48.240
because if there's one thing I know,

27:48.240 --> 27:50.400
that if you're gonna wander the world,

27:50.400 --> 27:51.840
you'd better be a black belt in some way.

27:51.840 --> 27:52.680
Well, I don't think they're talking about.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.480
Well, here's the thing, you're not gonna be a black belt

27:54.480 --> 27:57.640
in trigonometry or social studies, clearly,

27:57.640 --> 28:00.640
so maybe it's time to learn like Krav Maga or something,

28:00.640 --> 28:02.760
which I don't think has belts, but the point remains.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.840
Here's my advice that may be terrible.

28:06.520 --> 28:07.880
The Travis McElroy story.

28:07.880 --> 28:09.400
The story.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.760
Is this, there are lots of people that like,

28:12.760 --> 28:14.080
whenever you hear a story about someone

28:14.080 --> 28:16.200
that's really successful in like the entertainment industry,

28:16.200 --> 28:19.280
for example, who says like, well, I didn't go to college

28:19.280 --> 28:22.440
and said I just started working and now I'm where I am now.

28:23.640 --> 28:26.540
So my advice is this, either go back to school

28:26.540 --> 28:30.620
and focus on doing school or go into your chosen field

28:30.620 --> 28:33.040
and work your fucking ass off,

28:33.040 --> 28:36.080
because what you don't get to do is neither.

28:36.080 --> 28:39.440
Like you don't get to not finish schooling

28:39.440 --> 28:42.880
and also kick around for four years.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.080
I mean, you do, lots of people do that.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.480
Yes, but very rarely is that the person

28:47.480 --> 28:50.600
that you're reading like the Fortune 500, you know,

28:50.600 --> 28:51.960
like biographies. Just to waste time,

28:51.960 --> 28:53.000
I guess is what Travis is saying.

28:53.000 --> 28:53.840
Exactly.

28:53.840 --> 28:54.680
If you're not gonna be in school, fine,

28:54.680 --> 28:56.040
like that's not for everybody,

28:56.040 --> 28:58.720
but like throw yourself into something.

28:58.720 --> 29:02.840
Like go travel or go like work really hard at a field

29:02.840 --> 29:03.800
and get really good at it.

29:03.800 --> 29:04.640
Do something.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.520
Like if you're not gonna do the school thing,

29:06.520 --> 29:08.720
like just don't waste these days.

29:08.720 --> 29:13.720
You're young, you're probably strong, very strong and virile.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.020
Just don't waste fucking sexy.

29:16.020 --> 29:16.860
Sexy?

29:16.860 --> 29:18.400
That works for another reason too.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.640
Cause when people are like, why didn't you finish school?

29:20.640 --> 29:24.300
If your response is, nah, I just, I watched SpongeBob a lot.

29:24.300 --> 29:25.480
Like no one respects them.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.300
And if you're like, you know what?

29:26.300 --> 29:28.400
I got out there and started living my life.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.640
Then everybody's gonna be like, oh, okay, that makes sense.

29:31.640 --> 29:34.120
I would also say in terms of good adult advice

29:34.120 --> 29:36.760
is don't be afraid of how much stuff you don't know

29:36.760 --> 29:38.040
about being an adult.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.280
Because look around at all the dum-dums

29:40.280 --> 29:42.760
that are successfully doing that stuff.

29:42.760 --> 29:44.700
Like all of the dum-dums that know

29:44.700 --> 29:48.120
how to get a social security card and pay your taxes.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.160
They're silly, silly, silly goofs.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.820
And they can do it.

29:52.820 --> 29:53.660
You can do it.

29:53.660 --> 29:55.200
You can do anything.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.480
If you believe in yourself, you can do anything.

29:57.480 --> 29:58.600
You can do anything.

29:58.600 --> 29:59.960
But I think you should finish school

29:59.960 --> 30:01.240
cause you got real close.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.080
Money zone.

30:02.080 --> 30:02.900
Let's go to the money zone.

30:02.900 --> 30:07.900
I would like to tell you guys about a sponsor

30:15.360 --> 30:17.280
that I'm very close to.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.120
Okay.

30:18.120 --> 30:18.960
How close?

30:18.960 --> 30:20.720
I mean about two feet away.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.880
Cause it's like in my bedroom right now.

30:22.880 --> 30:24.840
One might say you've been sleeping with this sponsor.

30:24.840 --> 30:26.320
I've been sleeping with it.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.400
I'm in bed with this sponsor.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.320
Here's the thing, you guys.

30:30.320 --> 30:34.040
And it's not Powerade who does send sexual representatives.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.460
That it's a friend of his contract

30:35.460 --> 30:37.720
that three of us have to take turns making love to.

30:37.720 --> 30:38.840
And I hate it.

30:38.840 --> 30:39.680
I don't like it.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.200
We all hate it.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.400
But here's the thing, you guys.

30:42.400 --> 30:43.920
My brother, my brother and me is sponsored

30:43.920 --> 30:47.000
in part by Casper, an online retailer of premium,

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
obsessively engineered mattresses

30:49.000 --> 30:51.180
for a fraction of the price.

30:51.180 --> 30:53.840
Casper, I have a Casper mattress.

30:53.840 --> 30:54.980
I'm a big fan of it.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.680
Teresa and I, you know, in the past,

30:57.680 --> 31:00.960
I've always been very picky about my mattresses.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.320
I had the same one for far too long.

31:03.320 --> 31:06.120
And then when we moved, it was time to get a new mattress

31:06.120 --> 31:09.660
and we tried this out and it's amazing.

31:09.660 --> 31:12.120
Like I've slept so well since I got it.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.700
I usually like toss and turn

31:13.700 --> 31:17.120
and I have woken up in the same position every day.

31:17.120 --> 31:17.960
You really use it?

31:17.960 --> 31:19.200
Cause I thought initially you were gonna use it

31:19.200 --> 31:20.040
as a guest bed.

31:20.040 --> 31:20.860
You go like, got down with it.

31:20.860 --> 31:21.780
Oh, I got down with it.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.080
As soon as it got here, we were like,

31:23.080 --> 31:25.600
oh no, this is our new jam.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.560
This is the coolest thing.

31:27.560 --> 31:29.680
It came in a box.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.480
I'm gonna say like about two feet by two feet

31:32.480 --> 31:35.160
and then about three feet tall, four feet tall.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.440
I mean, depending on the size of the mattress you get,

31:37.440 --> 31:38.260
of course.

31:38.260 --> 31:41.960
But it comes in a completely like compact manageable.

31:41.960 --> 31:45.120
It's all rolled up in like a sealed package.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.400
And then when you open it up,

31:46.400 --> 31:48.960
basically all the air rushes back into it.

31:48.960 --> 31:51.120
And it kind of like, you know, in cartoons,

31:51.120 --> 31:54.000
when someone pulls the tab on like a raft

31:54.000 --> 31:54.840
and it suddenly goes like,

31:54.840 --> 31:55.680
boom, boom, boom.

31:55.680 --> 31:56.500
That's what it does.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.340
And it's super fun.

31:57.340 --> 31:58.320
Did you have to like clear the room?

31:58.320 --> 31:59.440
Like, oh no, oh no.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.360
Oh well, I probably should have better.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.120
It like, it expanded out.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.080
The cat ran away.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.200
It was great.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.120
Now you can just put these bad boys right on the floor,

32:07.120 --> 32:07.960
right?

32:07.960 --> 32:08.800
Like you don't need a box spring or whatever.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.000
No, it works on, you could put it,

32:11.000 --> 32:12.120
we have a slotted bed.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.500
So we don't even have a box spring

32:13.500 --> 32:14.440
and it works great with that.

32:14.440 --> 32:17.080
You can put it on the floor cause it's so supportive.

32:17.080 --> 32:18.480
You don't need anything underneath it.

32:18.480 --> 32:21.640
And Casper has a risk-free trial and return policy.

32:21.640 --> 32:25.720
So you can try sleeping on Casper for a hundred days

32:25.720 --> 32:27.800
with free delivery and painless returns.

32:27.800 --> 32:30.160
Like that's, that's a ridiculous offer.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.480
A hundred days.

32:31.480 --> 32:32.320
So over three months.

32:32.320 --> 32:33.600
I don't know what they're charging for these mattresses,

32:33.600 --> 32:35.160
but I bet it's $50 too much.

32:35.160 --> 32:36.440
Well, here's the thing, Justin.

32:36.440 --> 32:37.720
My brother and my brother and me listeners

32:37.720 --> 32:40.640
can get $50 towards any mattress purchase.

32:40.640 --> 32:43.600
If you go to Casper.com slash my brother

32:43.600 --> 32:45.560
and use the promo code, my brother,

32:45.560 --> 32:48.480
all one word at checkout, you get $50 off.

32:48.480 --> 32:50.560
Now terms and conditions apply, of course,

32:50.560 --> 32:51.400
because- What's that mean?

32:51.400 --> 32:52.220
What's that mean?

32:52.220 --> 32:53.060
What's that mean?

32:53.060 --> 32:54.840
It means that there are terms and there are conditions

32:54.840 --> 32:56.360
and they apply to the situation.

32:56.360 --> 33:00.640
God, no, no, God.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.600
I just want it Scott free.

33:02.600 --> 33:04.660
Well, we all want Scott free mattresses.

33:04.660 --> 33:05.500
I don't want terms.

33:05.500 --> 33:06.340
But sometimes Scott comes with them

33:06.340 --> 33:07.560
and that's one of the terms.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.400
I'm afraid of conditions.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.560
My friend Scott, he comes with the mattress.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.400
So go to Casper.com slash my brother

33:12.400 --> 33:14.160
and use the promo code, my brother,

33:14.160 --> 33:15.760
and you can save $50.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.600
And they have all different sizes

33:17.600 --> 33:21.080
and it's a great product.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.640
And there are no terms and conditions.

33:22.640 --> 33:24.640
No terms and conditions, no Griffin.

33:24.640 --> 33:25.480
We have to say-

33:25.480 --> 33:26.560
Terms and conditions apply.

33:26.560 --> 33:27.400
No, no, no.

33:27.400 --> 33:28.960
We have to say that terms and conditions apply,

33:28.960 --> 33:29.800
but don't worry.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.520
No terms or conditions to be found here.

33:31.520 --> 33:33.760
Tell them you're with us.

33:33.760 --> 33:34.960
They know us.

33:34.960 --> 33:35.800
Tell them you're with us.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.120
You guys are my bambinos.

33:37.120 --> 33:40.200
We'll waive the terms and those conditions, my man.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.080
I don't know.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.360
I'm checking with my boss upstairs.

33:44.360 --> 33:45.200
No conditions, huh?

33:45.200 --> 33:46.600
Let me see if I can get you a good deal

33:46.600 --> 33:48.200
vis-a-vis terms and conditions.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.640
Yeah, waived.

33:49.640 --> 33:50.520
Waived them right now.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.560
There will be, straight up though,

33:52.560 --> 33:54.920
there's gonna be some terms and conditions.

33:55.900 --> 33:56.740
We're goofing.

33:56.740 --> 33:58.040
We're all having a good time now,

33:58.040 --> 34:01.160
but don't try and sneak past those terms and conditions

34:01.160 --> 34:02.880
because they'll catch you.

34:02.880 --> 34:04.400
Note to future advertisers,

34:04.400 --> 34:07.320
if you put the line terms and conditions apply in our copy,

34:07.320 --> 34:10.040
we will talk about it for three minutes.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.320
We will make sure they know

34:11.320 --> 34:14.600
that terms and conditions do, in fact, apply.

34:14.600 --> 34:17.240
I have another message here from a sponsor

34:17.240 --> 34:19.040
that paid us to talk about them,

34:19.040 --> 34:20.580
and it is Nature Box.

34:20.580 --> 34:21.420
Heard of them?

34:21.420 --> 34:22.240
But they wouldn't have to.

34:22.240 --> 34:23.080
No, they wouldn't.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.000
I mean, they could pay us

34:24.000 --> 34:25.760
in many Belgian waffles at this point,

34:25.760 --> 34:30.760
but Nature Box is your online premier source

34:30.840 --> 34:33.620
for delicious, healthy snacks.

34:33.620 --> 34:35.660
These snacks are all made with zero artificial flavors,

34:39.900 --> 34:41.320

34:41.320 --> 34:43.800
You can get some strawberry lemonade fruit stars.

34:43.800 --> 34:46.000
You can get a sweet and salty nut medley.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.960
Oh my God, those sound so good.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.000
If you go to naturebox.com slash my brother,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.760
you can get a free trial box of their favorite snacks.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.720
That's naturebox.com slash my brother.

34:57.280 --> 35:00.100
your new bed, your new Casper bed.

35:00.100 --> 35:05.100
I got a message for Breezy B from Better Know a Husband.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.240
That sounds like a weird punny name.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.400
Like you better know a husband,

35:10.400 --> 35:12.500
but it actually has the name Noah in there.

35:12.500 --> 35:13.840
So I'm very confused.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.840
That is very confusing.

35:15.840 --> 35:18.360
Happy 12th anniversary, Breezy B.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.360
I'm so excited.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.480
We're doing new things together,

35:20.480 --> 35:22.600
like listening to the brothers and raising our daughter.

35:22.600 --> 35:25.080
Hopefully not at the same time,

35:25.080 --> 35:26.720
who by the time you're hearing this

35:26.720 --> 35:28.800
is at least one year old.

35:28.800 --> 35:29.640
I love you.

35:29.640 --> 35:31.100
Here's to an exciting 12 years.

35:31.100 --> 35:31.940
And there's a note here.

35:31.940 --> 35:36.480
It says, PS brothers, wifey likes it when you go meta.

35:36.480 --> 35:40.280
Oh, okay, what does that mean?

35:40.280 --> 35:42.560
I mean, it's like we talk about like the show,

35:43.560 --> 35:44.960
but we like part the veil.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.320
I'm wearing three headbands.

35:47.320 --> 35:48.160
Is that meta?

35:48.160 --> 35:50.860
I got a headband holding on my headband.

35:50.860 --> 35:51.700
Is that true?

35:51.700 --> 35:52.520
Yeah.

35:52.520 --> 35:54.280
I've just, I've been looking around the desk,

35:54.280 --> 35:57.880
picking up headbands and putting them on as I got bored.

35:57.880 --> 35:58.700
I've been drinking.

35:58.700 --> 35:59.960
That's what happened a lot this episode, huh?

35:59.960 --> 36:01.920
Yep, three times at least.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.320
I've been drinking the same cup of coffee

36:03.320 --> 36:04.920
since 7 a.m. this morning.

36:04.920 --> 36:06.680
And it's really, really, really gross.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.520
But I don't feel like going back in the kitchen

36:08.520 --> 36:11.400
and pour myself a new cup and throw it in the microwave.

36:11.400 --> 36:14.240
Speaking of drinking coffee,

36:14.240 --> 36:16.200
I had a realization this morning

36:16.200 --> 36:19.280
that some of my classic moments

36:19.280 --> 36:22.720
that I remember the most fondly on this program

36:22.720 --> 36:24.760
and have not listened to again

36:24.760 --> 36:27.120
have been when I've been drunk at live shows.

36:27.120 --> 36:29.120
And I had this realization today

36:29.120 --> 36:30.300
when I was making my coffee

36:30.300 --> 36:33.000
and I saw that bottle of raspberry liqueur staring back.

36:33.000 --> 36:33.840
Uh-oh.

36:33.840 --> 36:34.660
Wait a minute.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.040
Where it starts. Hold on.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.600
Hold on, wait a second.

36:37.600 --> 36:40.560
You can swallow this stuff anytime.

36:40.560 --> 36:41.400
Oh, boy.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.720
It is always swallowable.

36:42.720 --> 36:43.560
Oh, Jesus. Right?

36:43.560 --> 36:46.300
You don't have to be about to go on stage.

36:46.300 --> 36:48.640
The crazy thing about alcohol that you forget sometimes,

36:48.640 --> 36:49.560
you can drink it whenever.

36:49.560 --> 36:52.120
Yeah, it's drinking in the noon time,

36:52.120 --> 36:53.320
drinking in the noon time,

36:53.320 --> 36:55.580
drinking at supper time.

36:55.580 --> 36:57.680
When drinking is a liquid,

36:57.680 --> 36:59.440
you can drink drinking anytime.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.280
You can do it whenever.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.120
Yeah, sure.

37:01.120 --> 37:03.160
We've got another message for Kurt.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.600
We've got a message here for Justin.

37:04.600 --> 37:05.480
We love you.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.320
And this is a safe place.

37:07.320 --> 37:08.280
Shambered.

37:08.280 --> 37:09.360
Isn't my pronouncing that correctly?

37:09.360 --> 37:10.200
That's the raspberry liqueur.

37:10.200 --> 37:11.040
Shambered.

37:11.040 --> 37:11.860
Yeah. Nailed it.

37:11.860 --> 37:12.700
Crushed it.

37:12.700 --> 37:13.720
This message is for Kurt.

37:13.720 --> 37:16.960
It's from Coop, Jeremy, Mike and Mike.

37:16.960 --> 37:20.140
To our favorite sub, sub, sub librarian.

37:20.140 --> 37:21.720
Kurt with a C.

37:21.720 --> 37:23.560
Excited to spell with a K.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.180
Happy birthday and congratulations

37:25.180 --> 37:27.860
on finding and catching your true white whale.

37:27.860 --> 37:29.480
We hope your marriage to Becky

37:29.480 --> 37:31.260
will be a long and happy one.

37:31.260 --> 37:32.660
Hashtag gone girl.

37:32.660 --> 37:33.500
Wait, what?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.560
Did you get gone girled?

37:37.560 --> 37:38.720
Are you gone girled?

37:38.720 --> 37:41.480
Do you guys know how exponentially

37:41.480 --> 37:44.760
the rate of gone girling has increased

37:44.760 --> 37:46.280
since that fucking movie dropped?

37:46.280 --> 37:47.160
Didn't happen with the book,

37:47.160 --> 37:48.000
because nobody reads books.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.080
When that movie dropped,

37:49.080 --> 37:52.160
gone girling is like one out of every three marriages

37:52.160 --> 37:53.000
ends in gone girling.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.580
That's gonna be John Quinones' new show

37:54.580 --> 37:55.840
to catch a gone girl.

37:55.840 --> 37:56.680
Yeah.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.840
And not everybody pulls a Ben Affleck.

37:58.840 --> 38:00.840
Not everybody can reel it back in.

38:00.840 --> 38:01.680
You know what I mean?

38:01.680 --> 38:04.680
A lot of folks just get exumacuted

38:04.680 --> 38:06.800
because they get gone girled successfully.

38:06.800 --> 38:10.000
We probably shouldn't delve too deeply

38:10.000 --> 38:11.320
into the plot of Gone Girl

38:11.320 --> 38:15.880
here on where we don't wanna spoil the movie Gone Girl.

38:15.880 --> 38:17.300
Wait, are we gonna travel back in time

38:17.300 --> 38:19.740
to six months ago when no one had seen Gone Girl?

38:19.740 --> 38:21.320
I mean, I'll spoil the book for people

38:21.320 --> 38:23.360
because like Griffin said,

38:23.360 --> 38:25.920
right, but I don't wanna spoil a movie.

38:25.920 --> 38:28.560
I'm just saying keep your wits about you.

38:28.560 --> 38:32.440
And Gone Girl, the girl in Gone Girl,

38:32.440 --> 38:36.680
it doesn't necessarily refer to a gender.

38:36.680 --> 38:40.560
You can gone husband like easy.

38:40.560 --> 38:41.400
And that's happening too.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.000
That's called gone fishing.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.400
Gone, well, no, it's not called gone fishing.

38:45.400 --> 38:46.240
It'd be called like gone boy.

38:46.240 --> 38:49.000
Because men love to fish and ignore their wives.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.440
It's called bye-bye boy.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.600
And a lot of husbands out there

38:52.600 --> 38:54.600
are bye-bye boying their wives.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.040
And it's bad, it's bad, it's bad.

38:57.040 --> 38:57.880
It's bad.

38:57.880 --> 38:58.720
Don't do it.

38:58.720 --> 39:01.960
Can't we just call it like gone,

39:01.960 --> 39:03.760
what's the word, like S-O?

39:03.760 --> 39:05.920
Like gone, like sayonara S-O?

39:05.920 --> 39:07.080
So long S-O.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.440
See ya spouse.

39:08.440 --> 39:09.760
See ya spouse, that's great.

39:09.760 --> 39:11.120
That's all inclusive.

39:11.120 --> 39:12.720
Everybody can see ya spouse.

39:12.720 --> 39:15.260
Some people don't believe

39:15.260 --> 39:18.240
in having a state-sponsored relationship.

39:18.240 --> 39:19.360
They wanna keep it open-ended.

39:19.360 --> 39:20.800
Peace out, partner.

39:20.800 --> 39:21.640
Peace out, partner.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.000
Ooh, peace out, partner.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
I'm saying just we need to start including that

39:26.000 --> 39:28.040
just like de facto in vows.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.240
Like in sickness and in health.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.320
Also, I won't bye-bye,

39:31.320 --> 39:33.720
I won't bye-bye boy you at all.

39:33.720 --> 39:35.840
I won't bye-bye buddy you.

39:35.840 --> 39:36.680
Well.

39:36.680 --> 39:37.960
That's for like best friendships.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.080
You can bye-bye buddy somebody,

39:39.080 --> 39:39.920
it's just called moving.

39:39.920 --> 39:40.760
Yeah.

39:40.760 --> 39:44.200
I'm a police officer, I'm investigating.

39:44.200 --> 39:45.200
You're missing buddy.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.040
Why are you even talking to me right now?

39:47.040 --> 39:47.880
What do you mean?

39:47.880 --> 39:48.920
He lives in Indianapolis.

39:48.920 --> 39:49.760
He moved to Indianapolis.

39:49.760 --> 39:50.600
Moved to North Dakota.

39:50.600 --> 39:53.420
I don't know why I'm responsible for that.

39:53.420 --> 39:54.260
This is Biz.

39:54.260 --> 39:55.100
And I'm Teresa.

39:55.100 --> 39:57.280
And we host a show called One Bad Mother,

39:57.280 --> 39:59.280
a comedy podcast about parenting.

39:59.280 --> 40:01.360
Not a parenting podcast.

40:01.360 --> 40:02.280
Guess what?

40:02.280 --> 40:04.400
We both just had babies.

40:04.400 --> 40:05.240
Again.

40:06.160 --> 40:08.760
Check out the show enjoyed by breeders and ballers alike

40:08.760 --> 40:11.880
on iTunes or MaximumFun.org.

40:12.960 --> 40:14.600
How about a Yahoo?

40:14.600 --> 40:15.600
Okay, that's fine.

40:16.480 --> 40:19.720
This Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.000
Again, thank you Zoe.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Amy Rose who asks,

40:23.680 --> 40:28.480
I'm so, have a crush on Sonic the Hedgehog.

40:28.480 --> 40:29.320
Help.

40:30.440 --> 40:31.740
Lol.

40:31.740 --> 40:33.600
It gets kind of annoying crushing on someone

40:33.600 --> 40:36.000
who is probably not real.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.840
Someone cure me of my crush.

40:37.840 --> 40:40.000
Oh God, so much to unpack.

40:40.000 --> 40:40.840
Not really.

40:40.840 --> 40:42.360
This person's in love with Sonic the Hedgehog

40:42.360 --> 40:43.720
and they're not sure if they're real or not.

40:43.720 --> 40:45.600
And can any of us be sure?

40:45.600 --> 40:48.880
They're real in the sense that he's a pop icon, right?

40:48.880 --> 40:51.120
Who is like, we've all been in love with her.

40:51.120 --> 40:54.520
That there's countless universes

40:54.520 --> 40:57.400
in which everything happens.

40:57.400 --> 41:00.960
We can't say what is real or what is not real

41:00.960 --> 41:03.860
because it's only our perceptions that determine that.

41:03.860 --> 41:07.080
So there is definitely a universe

41:07.080 --> 41:09.440
in which Sonic the Hedgehog is real

41:09.440 --> 41:12.460
and is just going to town on this woman.

41:15.160 --> 41:17.600
Statistically, everything's happening

41:17.600 --> 41:19.760
in some universe at all times.

41:19.760 --> 41:23.000
You're saying infinite monkeys on infinite typewriters

41:23.000 --> 41:24.080
with an infinite amount of time

41:24.080 --> 41:25.360
will eventually create Hamlet.

41:25.360 --> 41:27.480
Somewhere in some alt-universe,

41:27.480 --> 41:29.880
Sonic is real and making love to this person.

41:29.880 --> 41:32.320
Oh, just going to town on her.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.080
Guaranteed.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.440
Griffin, at this point,

41:35.440 --> 41:37.720
I'm not even comfortable calling it making love.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.920
No, because he goes way too fast.

41:39.920 --> 41:40.760
So fast.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.680
Emotion is not part of it.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.800
It is just flesh machines at that point.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.480
At this point, they're just doing what comes naturally

41:47.480 --> 41:51.500
and that's Sonic the Hedgehog having sex with a woman.

41:51.500 --> 41:54.000
Hey, it actually happened in the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.040
Anyway, we're getting completely off topic.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.440
If you want to end your love affair

41:58.440 --> 41:59.440
with Sonic the Hedgehog,

41:59.440 --> 42:02.240
you could do like the rest of the nation did

42:02.240 --> 42:04.280
and just play any Sonic the Hedgehog game

42:04.280 --> 42:06.480
from the past 15 years.

42:06.480 --> 42:07.660
Play Sonic Free Rider.

42:07.660 --> 42:08.840
See if you still have a crush on him.

42:08.840 --> 42:10.240
I guarantee you will not.

42:10.240 --> 42:12.720
What's the one where Sonic goes to the Olympics?

42:12.720 --> 42:14.200
Sonic 3D Blast.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.040
Mm-hmm.

42:17.240 --> 42:18.920
Let me introduce Becky.

42:18.920 --> 42:20.320
I know you've had a hard time

42:20.320 --> 42:21.920
getting over the Sonic the Hedgehog.

42:21.920 --> 42:24.640
Can I introduce you to my friend Crash Bandicoot?

42:24.640 --> 42:26.200
Crash, come in here.

42:26.200 --> 42:27.040
Hey, what's up?

42:28.320 --> 42:29.360
This is my friend Becky.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.260
She's been real lonely lately.

42:31.260 --> 42:32.100
You look like you've been hurt.

42:32.100 --> 42:33.320
I'll leave you two to it.

42:33.320 --> 42:35.520
You look like you've been hurt by an echidna.

42:36.520 --> 42:39.000
That's the worst part of having an unfulfilled crush

42:39.000 --> 42:40.680
on Sonic is that you know

42:40.680 --> 42:42.360
when you're the most vulnerable,

42:42.360 --> 42:44.520
Tails is gonna be like knocking at your door.

42:44.520 --> 42:45.720
Hey, hey. Hey.

42:45.720 --> 42:47.520
You okay? Hey.

42:47.520 --> 42:48.360
I'm so sorry.

42:48.360 --> 42:50.440
You know you deserve so much better than that.

42:50.440 --> 42:51.280
Take it from me.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.840
Knuckles, what are you doing here?

42:53.840 --> 42:55.600
You get away from her.

42:56.680 --> 42:58.640
I'm so sorry he was bothering you.

42:58.640 --> 43:00.220
Listen, how you doing?

43:00.220 --> 43:02.440
Do you wanna do it in the Robotnik tonight?

43:02.440 --> 43:03.280
Travis.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.520
Oh, fuck you.

43:04.520 --> 43:06.780
Best part about Knuckles is he's in the Three Sims.

43:06.780 --> 43:07.620
Probably.

43:09.160 --> 43:11.240
Well, let me read you some of my fan fiction.

43:11.240 --> 43:12.600
That'll prove that that is correct.

43:12.600 --> 43:16.440
You just plug Knuckles into your existing relationship

43:16.440 --> 43:18.400
and then there he is.

43:18.400 --> 43:19.720
Wow. Yeah.

43:19.720 --> 43:21.520
Wow. You like that shit.

43:21.520 --> 43:22.400
I do.

43:22.400 --> 43:23.400
I do like that shit.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.600
You can't even pretend like you don't like that shit.

43:25.600 --> 43:27.320
No, I do indeed like that shit.

43:27.320 --> 43:29.140
I'm not gonna try to deny it.

43:29.140 --> 43:31.240
I enjoy that shit.

43:31.240 --> 43:33.260
My wife and I moved to do a new apartment last year.

43:33.260 --> 43:36.660
Part of our duties slash domain is gardening the backyard.

43:36.660 --> 43:39.240
Last year, we discovered a plant near our back gate

43:39.240 --> 43:41.400
in late summer that turned out to be a random

43:41.400 --> 43:42.760
marijuana plant. Oh, boy.

43:42.760 --> 43:44.680
Neither of us do the pot.

43:44.680 --> 43:47.080
It was a tiny plant and so we just let it flower

43:47.080 --> 43:49.040
and figured the Minnesota winter would take care

43:49.040 --> 43:51.080
of what we didn't feel like dealing with.

43:51.080 --> 43:52.720
It died or so we thought.

43:52.720 --> 43:55.220
This year, it appears that multiple,

43:56.600 --> 43:58.880
multiple plants have sprouted up

43:58.880 --> 44:02.040
that are totally 100% more pot.

44:02.040 --> 44:05.120
I feel bad destroying them as many people put in

44:05.120 --> 44:06.400
a lot of work to grow this stuff

44:06.400 --> 44:09.200
but I also have no use for it and it's kinda illegal.

44:09.200 --> 44:11.240
What should we do with this brothers?

44:11.240 --> 44:14.000
That's from mystified by marijuana in Minneapolis.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.360
This season on Breaking Bad 2.

44:16.360 --> 44:19.080
What's the PO box number for our Huntington?

44:20.280 --> 44:21.360
Fuck that.

44:21.360 --> 44:23.160
There is a human being.

44:23.160 --> 44:26.600
We were in Minneapolis a month ago.

44:26.600 --> 44:29.760
There was a person presumably at that show

44:29.760 --> 44:31.440
who was like, I don't know what I'm gonna do

44:31.440 --> 44:32.840
with all the pot at my house.

44:32.840 --> 44:36.080
We've been asking for years.

44:36.080 --> 44:37.640
Years. Please don't send us pot in the mail.

44:37.640 --> 44:39.240
Holy shit, please don't do that.

44:39.240 --> 44:40.440
Hachi-machi please don't.

44:40.440 --> 44:43.280
Yipes, Justin as a kid, do not do that.

44:46.040 --> 44:47.880
You should probably start selling it.

44:47.880 --> 44:49.720
Yeah, I mean that's it, right?

44:49.720 --> 44:51.200
Whoa.

44:51.200 --> 44:54.640
In this economy, leaving money on the table?

44:54.640 --> 44:56.140
It's gonna be, here's what I'll say actually.

44:56.140 --> 44:56.980
Just let it be,

44:56.980 --> 44:58.960
cause that's just gonna be legal countrywide

44:58.960 --> 45:00.340
in the next two years.

45:00.340 --> 45:02.600
This is a serious question that I need someone

45:02.600 --> 45:03.880
to tweet at me after the show

45:03.880 --> 45:06.720
and tell me the answer to this.

45:06.720 --> 45:11.720
Is there such a thing as like wild marijuana these days?

45:14.360 --> 45:16.840
But in like the backyard

45:16.840 --> 45:19.240
of like a Minnesota apartment complex,

45:19.240 --> 45:20.960
it's like, oh yeah, we got,

45:20.960 --> 45:23.160
there's some clovers growing here

45:23.160 --> 45:25.720
and like some dandelions and some weed.

45:25.720 --> 45:27.680
Like that's a thing?

45:27.680 --> 45:28.520
Where do you think it came from?

45:28.520 --> 45:29.360
But I could expect to find it

45:29.360 --> 45:32.240
in like a hillside out in the country.

45:32.240 --> 45:33.520
In a shire.

45:33.520 --> 45:34.920
In the shire.

45:34.920 --> 45:39.320
But I'm just, it's weird to me that a random marijuana plant

45:39.320 --> 45:42.560
that a bird like pooped out a seed of a marijuana plant

45:42.560 --> 45:43.400
in the backyard. Oh my God, dude,

45:43.400 --> 45:45.180
there's so many gross misconceptions,

45:45.180 --> 45:47.480
just sort of about nature.

45:47.480 --> 45:48.320
That's how it works.

45:48.320 --> 45:49.560
Birds, they eat the seeds

45:49.560 --> 45:50.720
and then they poop out the seeds

45:50.720 --> 45:52.440
and the seeds grow.

45:52.440 --> 45:53.280
Then you smoke them.

45:53.280 --> 45:54.960
Then you smoke the bird poop.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.280
If you smoke bird poop, you will get high.

45:57.280 --> 45:58.760
What would you guys legit,

45:58.760 --> 46:00.280
like let's put the,

46:00.280 --> 46:03.240
okay, I'm gonna open up the joke locker for a second.

46:03.240 --> 46:05.280
Take your jokes, put it in the joke locker.

46:05.280 --> 46:08.080
Close it up fully.

46:08.080 --> 46:09.440
Now the jokes are in the joke locker.

46:09.440 --> 46:10.640
If you were in this situation,

46:10.640 --> 46:11.760
what would you literally do?

46:11.760 --> 46:13.240
Well, I totally get the confusion

46:13.240 --> 46:15.160
because I'm sitting here thinking like,

46:15.160 --> 46:19.240
one, I would be so worried that someone would find it

46:19.240 --> 46:22.480
and just immediately assume I planted it there.

46:22.480 --> 46:23.800
Sure. You know what I mean?

46:23.800 --> 46:27.600
Because the cockamamie story of,

46:27.600 --> 46:29.840
it's just a random plant, I guess.

46:29.840 --> 46:31.840
Like no one's gonna believe that.

46:31.840 --> 46:33.840
Even if it's true.

46:33.840 --> 46:36.520
How would it be discovered would be my question.

46:36.520 --> 46:37.360
I mean, I don't understand.

46:37.360 --> 46:38.640
Well, you're in an apartment complex.

46:38.640 --> 46:40.440
There's other people living there.

46:40.440 --> 46:42.800
Oh, by which you mean there's plenty of other people

46:42.800 --> 46:43.640
to take the fall.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.960
But that could be somebody else's plant.

46:46.960 --> 46:50.880
But it's this person's job to garden in the backyard.

46:50.880 --> 46:51.720
Oh, that's true.

46:51.720 --> 46:53.760
They're gonna be the first suspect.

46:53.760 --> 46:55.480
But as any good cop knows,

46:55.480 --> 46:58.360
it's very rarely the most obvious suspect.

46:58.360 --> 47:00.520
Do you think it was the apartment butler?

47:00.520 --> 47:03.360
I think it was the apartment butler, Travis.

47:03.360 --> 47:05.600
Oh, sorry, I broke into the joke locker.

47:05.600 --> 47:06.440
Let me put that back in there.

47:06.440 --> 47:07.640
Not really.

47:07.640 --> 47:09.120
No, no.

47:09.120 --> 47:09.960
Not technically speaking.

47:09.960 --> 47:13.080
I got that out of the joke shoe box that was under my bed.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.400
I think you're right in that

47:14.400 --> 47:15.800
destroying this plant is the wrong move.

47:15.800 --> 47:18.640
Because it's a living thing.

47:18.640 --> 47:19.480
It's kind.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.160
And it's kind, and it wants to help you.

47:21.160 --> 47:22.800
So you need to help it.

47:22.800 --> 47:27.600
And just like to pot it, very gently move it into a pot,

47:27.600 --> 47:31.040
put that pot in another pot, and then take it inside.

47:31.040 --> 47:32.480
And then you're gonna need to find

47:32.480 --> 47:34.960
the right hydroponic system for you.

47:34.960 --> 47:35.800
Cause there's lots of difference.

47:35.800 --> 47:37.880
Yeah, you're probably gonna have to convert your bedroom.

47:37.880 --> 47:39.160
Oh yeah, that's not a bedroom anymore.

47:39.160 --> 47:41.200
This is a no bedroom, one bath.

47:41.200 --> 47:43.400
And the bedroom, the bedroom,

47:43.400 --> 47:45.560
the only bed in there is a bed

47:45.560 --> 47:49.160
of that sweet, kind Carolina kush.

47:49.160 --> 47:52.600
I know we live in Minneapolis.

47:52.600 --> 47:53.440
I know.

47:53.440 --> 47:57.240
The strain was brought here by a bird.

47:57.240 --> 47:58.720
This kind strain.

47:58.720 --> 47:59.960
A tired bird.

47:59.960 --> 48:03.520
This kind, this kind kaki-laki.

48:03.520 --> 48:05.080
This bird who brought it this far

48:05.080 --> 48:07.600
and then died to bring us this sweet sticky weed.

48:07.600 --> 48:08.440
He died.

48:08.440 --> 48:13.280
And the plant grew, the bird's body nurtured the seed

48:13.280 --> 48:15.520
and gave us this kind, kind kaki-laki.

48:15.520 --> 48:17.360
This is our life now, honey.

48:17.360 --> 48:19.000
This is our life now.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.720
We're breaking bad.

48:20.720 --> 48:23.520
We are the ones who knock, I think.

48:23.520 --> 48:24.560
I didn't watch the whole show,

48:24.560 --> 48:26.520
and I can't now cause we don't have a TV.

48:26.520 --> 48:27.840
Cause I had to move it out of the room

48:27.840 --> 48:28.840
cause this is our garden.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.280
It got in the way of my weed.

48:30.280 --> 48:31.840
I put the plant in front of the TV

48:31.840 --> 48:33.420
and I turned the brightness all the way up.

48:33.420 --> 48:35.440
I think it's gonna happen.

48:35.440 --> 48:38.000
I've been talking to it like the little prince's rose.

48:38.000 --> 48:43.000
Man, that'd be a much different book.

48:43.140 --> 48:45.040
Yeah, it'd be a way better book.

48:45.040 --> 48:46.560
Folks, thank you so much for listening

48:46.560 --> 48:48.400
to our comedy podcast.

48:48.400 --> 48:51.560
My brother, my brother and me, 2.0,

48:51.560 --> 48:52.400
boys in the house.

48:52.400 --> 48:53.360
Power A presents.

48:53.360 --> 48:54.880
Power A presents, fuck.

48:54.880 --> 48:57.000
Let me just try to start the whole episode over.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.920
Thanks, hey.

48:59.920 --> 49:01.200
We didn't, I mean, we just didn't mention

49:01.200 --> 49:02.920
Power A nearly enough.

49:02.920 --> 49:03.760
Yeah, you're right.

49:03.760 --> 49:04.760
Hey, extreme buds.

49:04.760 --> 49:06.160
Hey, extreme buds.

49:06.160 --> 49:07.080
Thanks so much for listening to Power A.

49:07.080 --> 49:09.560
Oh, we need a wet stunt.

49:09.560 --> 49:10.400
Okay, hold on.

49:11.680 --> 49:13.840
Oh, God, no.

49:13.840 --> 49:16.840
That's what wet stunts sound like.

49:16.840 --> 49:18.520
Thanks so much for listening to Power A

49:18.520 --> 49:19.840
presents my brother, my brother and me,

49:19.840 --> 49:22.480
2.0, boys in the house, a Power A experience.

49:22.480 --> 49:24.040
I have an idea for a wet stunt.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.280
Okay, okay.

49:25.280 --> 49:28.400
I would like everybody to tweet us pictures

49:28.400 --> 49:30.580
of them choosing not to drink Power A.

49:32.240 --> 49:34.200
Wait a minute, hold on, wait.

49:34.200 --> 49:35.960
Travis, you've nailed it.

49:35.960 --> 49:37.280
Okay.

49:37.280 --> 49:39.720
The only way we're gonna be free from this power prison.

49:39.720 --> 49:43.080
We have to make this relationship with Power A

49:43.080 --> 49:46.960
as undesirable to Power A as humanly possible.

49:46.960 --> 49:50.560
So what I want you to do is use the hashtag wet stunts

49:50.560 --> 49:54.600
to tweet pictures that just really,

49:54.600 --> 49:56.600
really make Power A look unappealing.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.480
That's what I need, that's what I need you to do.

49:58.480 --> 49:59.400
Do not tweet it.

49:59.400 --> 50:01.040
Power A has to be in the picture.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.280
You can't just like take a picture

50:02.280 --> 50:04.600
of you going like P.U. stink face.

50:04.600 --> 50:07.680
And by the way, don't tweet it at Power A.

50:07.680 --> 50:10.360
No, because that's not what we want at all.

50:10.360 --> 50:12.720
That's not what we, that's not the kind of attention

50:12.720 --> 50:15.320
we want to draw, personally.

50:17.720 --> 50:20.120
It would be pretty fucking funny though.

50:20.120 --> 50:22.360
Yeah, I just don't want to get Power A, big Power A,

50:22.360 --> 50:23.720
because that's like Coke, right?

50:23.720 --> 50:24.560
Or Pepsi? Yeah.

50:24.560 --> 50:25.380
I don't know.

50:25.380 --> 50:26.220
I don't need them on my hands.

50:26.220 --> 50:29.640
We're pretty big, but we're not Coca-Cola big.

50:29.640 --> 50:30.880
We're not Coca-Cola big.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.360
That's gonna be a good stunt.

50:32.360 --> 50:34.280
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

50:34.280 --> 50:35.120
for the use of our theme song.

50:35.120 --> 50:37.920
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

50:37.920 --> 50:39.140
It's a wonderful album.

50:39.140 --> 50:43.000
We're gonna be kicking it with John Roderick

50:43.000 --> 50:44.520
at Max Funk on here in a few weeks.

50:44.520 --> 50:45.360
We're really excited.

50:45.360 --> 50:47.480
Johnny R, as I'm sure he'll insist we call him

50:47.480 --> 50:49.440
at the weekend's end.

50:49.440 --> 50:50.880
Except that we won't call him that,

50:50.880 --> 50:54.200
because we'll all probably be too nervous to talk to him.

50:54.200 --> 50:55.880
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

50:55.880 --> 50:57.940
Anyway, thank you John Roderick in the long winters.

50:57.940 --> 50:59.400
Also, thanks again to Nature Box,

51:10.620 --> 51:13.280
which he will soon be the president of.

51:13.280 --> 51:14.640
I haven't been keeping track of it,

51:14.640 --> 51:17.480
but he's running for office in the Seattle area,

51:17.480 --> 51:19.240
which big fans of.

51:19.240 --> 51:20.080
Yeah.

51:20.080 --> 51:23.600
But we're doing a Pacific Northwest tour in August.

51:23.600 --> 51:26.040
We're going to Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver,

51:26.040 --> 51:29.660
August 28th, 29th, 30th respectively.

51:29.660 --> 51:32.000
The Portland show is already sold out.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.320
So unfortunately, you won't be able to see us at that one

51:34.320 --> 51:35.560
unless you've already got tickets.

51:35.560 --> 51:36.760
But there's still tickets available

51:36.760 --> 51:38.240
for Seattle and Vancouver.

51:38.240 --> 51:42.360
If you go to bit.ly forward slash mbmbamseattle

tickets for that are selling out.

51:49.680 --> 51:53.760
And it's signed seating, so don't sleep on it.

51:53.760 --> 51:56.560
Go get your tickets today, and we'll see you in August.

51:58.400 --> 52:00.400
Go listen to the other shows at the Maximum Fun Network

52:00.400 --> 52:02.000

52:02.000 --> 52:04.680
There's some really, really great shows all free.

52:04.680 --> 52:05.800
And if you like this one,

52:05.800 --> 52:07.380

52:11.000 --> 52:13.440
and Throwing Shade and Jordan Jesse Go

52:13.440 --> 52:15.280
and Judge John Hodgman.

52:15.280 --> 52:16.120
We all play-

52:16.120 --> 52:18.960
Bones the Adventure Zone and Bunker Buddies.

52:18.960 --> 52:20.240
Yes, which are all shows we do.

52:20.240 --> 52:21.760
Travis, you have a new show.

52:21.760 --> 52:23.000
It's not on Max Fun,

52:23.000 --> 52:25.320
but you want to tell the people about it?

52:25.320 --> 52:26.160
It's my brand new show.

52:26.160 --> 52:29.080
Yeah, so Brent, Brent O'Floss,

52:29.080 --> 52:30.640
who was my roommate in college

52:30.640 --> 52:32.920
and has been one of my best friends for 13 years,

52:32.920 --> 52:36.240
he and I launched a new show called Trends Like These.

52:36.240 --> 52:38.960
Basically, we talk about what the trending news

52:38.960 --> 52:39.780
on the internet.

52:39.780 --> 52:43.680
So for example, last week we talked about DadBod,

52:43.680 --> 52:47.320
we talked about Jaden Smith showing up to prom

52:47.320 --> 52:49.320
dressed as Batman.

52:49.320 --> 52:51.480
We talked about Simon Pegg.

52:51.480 --> 52:53.420
So we just talk about whatever stories are trending

52:53.420 --> 52:56.820
on like Twitter and Facebook and all over the internet.

52:56.820 --> 53:01.160
It's on iTunes, it's on Stitcher, it's on everything.

53:01.160 --> 53:03.280
You can go to trendslikethese.com

53:03.280 --> 53:05.200
and we've got links to all the different ways

53:05.200 --> 53:06.080
to listen to the show.

53:06.080 --> 53:07.560
It comes out every Thursday

53:07.560 --> 53:09.800
and we put out many episodes on Monday

53:09.800 --> 53:12.760
to talk about the news that happened over the weekend.

53:12.760 --> 53:15.440
So go check it out and let me know what you think.

53:15.440 --> 53:16.440
I've got a new show too.

53:16.440 --> 53:17.760
It's called Things I Bought at Sheetz.

53:17.760 --> 53:18.580
It's on YouTube.

53:18.580 --> 53:20.040
Search for Things I Bought at Sheetz.

53:20.040 --> 53:22.280
It's like the best thing ever.

53:22.280 --> 53:24.720
Sheetz has a Z at the end, Things I Bought at Sheetz.

53:24.720 --> 53:28.960
It's my new food review slash quiz show

53:28.960 --> 53:31.280
with my friend Dwight Slappy.

53:31.280 --> 53:33.000
It's called Things I Bought at Sheetz

53:33.000 --> 53:34.480
and start at the beginning

53:34.480 --> 53:36.040
because you don't wanna be lost.

53:36.040 --> 53:37.080
There's a playlist.

53:37.080 --> 53:40.280
Big Gulp is on hiatus, as you all know,

53:40.280 --> 53:43.360
but we're gonna be coming back for the fourth season.

53:43.360 --> 53:45.800
I think in July is when post-production

53:45.800 --> 53:47.080
will be wrapping up on that

53:47.080 --> 53:48.500
and then we're doing the premiere

53:48.500 --> 53:50.200
at the Cannes Film Festival.

53:50.200 --> 53:51.040
So get there.

53:51.040 --> 53:51.860
Get there.

53:51.860 --> 53:52.800
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

53:52.800 --> 53:54.280
Yeah, one last Yahoo would be great.
