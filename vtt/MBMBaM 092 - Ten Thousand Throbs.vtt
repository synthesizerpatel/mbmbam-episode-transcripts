00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.800
Hail to the chief, he's the chief and he needs hailing.

00:49.360 --> 00:53.920
That's of course a classic scene from the hit film My Fellow Americans,

00:54.480 --> 00:58.800
starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, both as President John F. Kennedy.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.000
Two angry presidents.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.280
Two angry presidents.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.480
Grumpy old presidents.

01:02.480 --> 01:08.960
Grumpy old statesmen. One of the classics of their later years, My Fellow Americans.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.280
But today we're celebrating Presidents Day, of course, here at My Brother and Me,

01:13.280 --> 01:17.760
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest president, Justin McElroy.

01:17.760 --> 01:20.000
I'm your middle-est president, Travis McElroy.

01:20.560 --> 01:25.280
Guys, President Obama is a space monster from the Planet Muslim,

01:25.280 --> 01:30.320
and I don't understand why he gets his own holiday and he's trying to kill my freedom.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.240
Before we get emails on this, I just remembered Walter

01:34.240 --> 01:37.360
Matthau was not in My Fellow Americans, it was James Garner.

01:37.360 --> 01:41.760
And before we get other emails about this, Griffin is Griffin McElroy.

01:43.360 --> 01:47.120
But my position on President Obama's space monstership stands.

01:47.120 --> 01:50.480
I know, but you definitely want to put a signature at the end of that bomb vault

01:51.040 --> 01:53.360
so people know who that voice is attached to.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.360
How come no matter how many times we ask him,

01:55.360 --> 01:58.640
he can't produce a birth certificate showing that he's not from outer space?

01:59.840 --> 02:01.360
Have you guys ever noticed that?

02:01.360 --> 02:02.720
Let us see your earth, bud.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.800
So I have a question for you guys.

02:05.840 --> 02:09.280
My dear friend Jeremy Dubin asked me this, and it kind of started.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.360
So here's the situation.

02:12.720 --> 02:15.200
You're about to get into a bar fight, right?

02:15.200 --> 02:16.640
Just a big old brawl.

02:16.640 --> 02:20.240
You can have three presidents backing you up.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.280
Which three do you choose?

02:21.280 --> 02:25.120
Oh, well, I think we can all agree that James Buchanan's right out.

02:25.120 --> 02:26.800
He died of the flu, right?

02:26.800 --> 02:27.300
Yep.

02:27.300 --> 02:27.800
Yeah.

02:27.800 --> 02:28.300
Agreed.

02:28.300 --> 02:28.800
No Buchanan.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.440
Is that the one that gave the too long speech and he died from it?

02:33.440 --> 02:33.940
Yep.

02:33.940 --> 02:34.480
I think.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.200
I mean, yeah, if you punch that guy outside, he's done for.

02:37.200 --> 02:37.700
He's dead.

02:37.700 --> 02:41.760
I think we can all agree that first and foremost, he's Andrew Jackson.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.440
No, that's ridiculous.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.120
Andrew Jackson has killed a man.

02:45.120 --> 02:46.960
Andrew Jackson is a crazy person.

02:46.960 --> 02:50.720
Yeah, you gotta have Andy J backing you up.

02:50.720 --> 02:51.760
Backing you up.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.440
Can I drop Polk on you guys?

02:53.440 --> 02:54.800
See, I said Polk.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.800
He's so thick, so hardy.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.840
I said Polk, too.

02:57.840 --> 02:58.720
Can't knock him over.

02:59.360 --> 03:05.440
Yeah, I mean, another, I think, solid choice would be Taft,

03:05.440 --> 03:08.640
because you just keep pounding it, and where are his vital organs?

03:08.640 --> 03:09.600
I don't know.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.960
And he can do that big belly bounce thing where he knocks someone across the room?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.880
He does, and he does a thousand hand slap.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.240
I think you're thinking of Zangief.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.600
I am thinking of E. Honda, of course.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.760
James K. Polk can do Yoga Fire, though.

03:23.760 --> 03:24.480
Yoga Fire.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.040
Obviously, there's Teddy Roosevelt.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.800
Teddy Roosevelt, though, that's so odd.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.640
He's probably busy in somebody else's fantasy ballroom fight.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.200
You're not going to be able to get Teddy.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.400
He's going to be busy.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.840
And what about Franklin?

03:37.840 --> 03:38.640
Franklin is good.

03:38.640 --> 03:39.840
Get him off the yard.

03:39.840 --> 03:40.880
Who's going to go after him?

03:40.880 --> 03:45.840
If it's Last Man Standing, he has got a distinct advantage, or disadvantage,

03:45.840 --> 03:48.720
depending on how strict the rules are.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.320
Can I say Jeb Bartlett?

03:50.320 --> 03:50.880
OK.

03:50.880 --> 03:51.680
Yeah, why not?

03:54.080 --> 03:57.680
His illness, I don't know, may not make him the fiercest competitor.

03:59.280 --> 04:04.720
He's never been a military man, as folks on that show want to point out.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.960
Sheriff Ford turned down offers to play in the NFL.

04:07.840 --> 04:11.600
Maybe then he would be a good quarterback for your punch team.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.680
What about Bill Clinton?

04:13.680 --> 04:14.960
Fucker's charming.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.080
He's so charming.

04:16.080 --> 04:17.360
Hey, we don't need to do this.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.320
Hey, let's all relax over a nice Zima.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.000
That's my impression of Bill Clinton.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.680
I'm actually actually, statistically speaking, a lot of people don't know this,

04:27.680 --> 04:32.960
I'm actually the only person on Earth who impersonates Bill Clinton.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.640
So that is the actually first Bill Clinton impression that a lot of people hear.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.400
He really captured his Zima presidency so well.

04:38.400 --> 04:38.880
Here's the thing.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.320
The thing is, you got to talk like this.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.960
Yeah, and that's it.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.720
Talk like Bill Clinton.

04:48.480 --> 04:49.920
Maybe a fellatio goof.

04:51.520 --> 04:54.720
My fellow Americans, blow your jobs.

04:55.840 --> 04:56.480
Is that good?

04:57.040 --> 04:58.320
Is that a good impression?

04:59.040 --> 05:02.720
I'm capturing his irreverence, certainly.

05:03.520 --> 05:08.640
Hey, let's, as much as I love talking about which presidents could take a punch,

05:08.640 --> 05:11.360
we should probably help some people out with advice.

05:11.360 --> 05:15.040
This first question comes to us from FormSpring.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.360
I got a girl's number from a night out a few weeks ago,

05:19.360 --> 05:21.600
but after a few texts, nothing came from it.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.440
What's the protocol for the number?

05:23.440 --> 05:25.760
Do I delete it, forget it ever happened,

05:25.760 --> 05:29.120
or do I leave it and live in constant fear of accidentally dialing it?

05:30.560 --> 05:31.680
Oh, man.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.240
Guys, is FormSpring like Pinterest?

05:35.120 --> 05:36.960
I do not know Pinterest.

05:36.960 --> 05:40.800
Is that a social networking thing?

05:40.800 --> 05:45.840
It's like Skype, but with push pins, from what I understand.

05:45.840 --> 05:51.360
I actually have reached my limit on any joining any sort of social networks,

05:51.360 --> 05:53.280
and I think this is how you become an old person,

05:53.840 --> 05:56.800
in that I used to think it was so dismissive, you know?

05:56.800 --> 05:58.880
You would try to teach an old person something new,

05:58.880 --> 06:01.760
and they say, ugh, I'm not gonna learn that.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.520
And then I'm just like, hey, you're being cranky.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.440
What you discover as you get a little older,

06:05.440 --> 06:08.160
there's a great sense of power to say like,

06:08.160 --> 06:10.800
hey, I'm not putting that in my life.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.000
Get out of here.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.240
Google Buzz, buzz off.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.680
Buzz off, keep it.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.960
Tweeter, tweet-toe, tweet off, tweet out of here.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.040
Pinterest.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.680
You are gonna call that number.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.400
You will call the number, and it will not be accidental, it will be drunk.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.720
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,

06:33.280 --> 06:34.800
it'll maybe be a year from now,

06:34.800 --> 06:37.440
when you're real sad and lonely on Valentine's Day,

06:37.440 --> 06:39.040
and you just call her at night and you go,

06:39.040 --> 06:44.160
hey, hey, Debra, Debra was soaking in about a year.

06:44.160 --> 06:47.040
I thought we had something special together.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.400
Man, the whole episode, huh?

06:51.280 --> 06:53.680
This is former president Bill Clinton.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.160
I'm a ghost now.

06:56.960 --> 07:00.800
Now I'm a ghost who loves blowjobs.

07:00.800 --> 07:04.000
I love blowjobs, balanced budgets, and hauntings.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.800
Griffin, yours sounds more like Don Don's.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.360
You got it.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.840
The secret to Bill Clinton is you gotta sound like a ghost

07:09.840 --> 07:11.200
underneath a bunch of blankets.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.120
That's the secret.

07:13.120 --> 07:15.120
I love Bill Clinton.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.120
And if you felt a little undertaker in there,

07:21.280 --> 07:25.840
oh yes, it's me, former president Bill Clinton.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.800
Blowjobs.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.560
I don't understand why you need this number.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.200
You know what I mean?

07:35.200 --> 07:38.160
I like to keep my contact list real tight.

07:39.600 --> 07:44.000
I very recently deleted the Gino's Pizza phone number

07:44.000 --> 07:46.400
from Huntington, where I don't live anymore.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.880
But I needed that quick access so I could call him up,

07:50.880 --> 07:54.160
get a pizza ready in 10 minutes, grab it, and chomp.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.920
But now I don't need that number anymore.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.400
You have even less utility for the number you have.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.480
Yeah, what if he does need it someday?

08:03.040 --> 08:04.000
It's good to let go.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.600
You know what, she rejected you.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.880
This is your chance, this is your only chance, to reject her.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.000
Say, okay, I don't need you in my life either.

08:12.000 --> 08:12.960
Close the door on her.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.600
Who cares if they're already closed?

08:17.600 --> 08:20.160
But you can close it on your side, like a hotel room.

08:22.000 --> 08:22.960
Two doors.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.160
You closed your door.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.600
Doesn't matter if the other one's closed.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.880
You'll never think about it again,

08:26.880 --> 08:30.240
because as far as you can remember, you deleted her number.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.840
And that's what you'll tell your grandkids.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.720
Or you taught me to tone her,

08:34.720 --> 08:36.000
and you write it on a bathroom wall.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.040
Don't do that.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.160
Again, you will be tempted.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.200
Put it on Pinterest.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.000
Put it on Pinterest.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.040
No one knows what that is.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.800
It should be safe there.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.640
They'll want to find it and delete it.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.440
But yeah, you don't want to hold on to that.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.160
Yeah, delete it.

08:52.160 --> 08:52.720
Get rid of it.

08:53.760 --> 08:57.360
While working at Subway one day with my boyfriend,

08:57.360 --> 09:00.080
a customer came up and their fly was down.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.360
We were both wondering,

09:01.360 --> 09:04.880
what is the proper etiquette of notifying someone of this?

09:04.880 --> 09:07.040
Since they are a paying customer,

09:07.040 --> 09:09.680
we don't want to embarrass them and lose their business.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.160
But we also don't want them walking around being embarrassed

09:12.160 --> 09:13.200
that their zipper is down.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.640
What do we do?

09:14.640 --> 09:16.720
That's from a sweet sandwich artist.

09:18.160 --> 09:18.960
Oh man.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.020
Okay.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.360
My feeling on this has always gone,

09:23.360 --> 09:25.600
like the same thing with food and the teeth, right?

09:25.600 --> 09:30.640
If I, my rationale is, if I don't tell them,

09:31.200 --> 09:33.520
then they're just going to walk around like a goof all day.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.960
They'll want to know it's there.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.960
But then as I got older, it dawned on me,

09:37.680 --> 09:41.520
if no one tells them, they'll just think no one noticed.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.320
Here's the thing though, because here's what I do.

09:44.320 --> 09:48.080
If I like, if I've been walking all day with my zipper down,

09:48.080 --> 09:49.440
I get home and realize it,

09:49.440 --> 09:51.920
I do a mental checklist back through the day

09:51.920 --> 09:54.000
of all the people I had contacted.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.480
Of all the people I had contact with and think,

09:56.480 --> 09:57.600
why didn't they tell me?

09:57.600 --> 09:59.040
Why didn't they tell me?

09:59.040 --> 10:00.720
Why didn't any of these people tell me?

10:00.720 --> 10:02.960
It's like drawing up a containment net

10:02.960 --> 10:04.400
and like a viral outbreak.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.560
You're like, oh man, I was at the grocery store,

10:06.560 --> 10:08.720
so they all saw it, told all their friends.

10:09.360 --> 10:09.760
Yeah.

10:09.760 --> 10:13.040
And then incredible arousal is the only thing,

10:13.040 --> 10:14.560
like a blinding arousal.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.200
Diving into a sun of arousal.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.400
Just burning your skin off with the heat

10:22.400 --> 10:24.320
of the passion of your self-exposure

10:24.320 --> 10:25.920
to the neighborhood living.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.160
I think my favorite thing about the fear

10:28.160 --> 10:29.840
of being embarrassed about having your zipper down

10:29.840 --> 10:32.320
is unless your junk is actually like hanging out,

10:33.040 --> 10:33.840
nothing happened.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.960
Like the only thing you're embarrassed about

10:36.960 --> 10:39.360
is that a zipper was undone on your pants.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.440
Like there was no other consequence to it.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.280
Are you saying, but Charles, that doesn't make sense

10:43.280 --> 10:45.440
because then we could just walk around zipper free.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.320
If that was the case, we'd just all have big gaps down there.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.320
Big, big shitty pockets.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.320
No, I'm not saying you shouldn't do the zipper,

10:52.320 --> 10:54.640
but I'm just saying like that horrified feeling you get

10:54.640 --> 10:56.160
when you realize that your zipper's been down

10:56.160 --> 10:57.120
for like four hours.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.680
Isn't as bad as the feeling is realizing

10:59.680 --> 11:02.560
that you've been hanging some-

11:02.560 --> 11:03.680
Hanging brain.

11:03.680 --> 11:04.320
Hanging brain.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.640
Well, yeah, I would say that having your junk

11:08.640 --> 11:10.000
actually hanging out of your pants

11:10.000 --> 11:10.880
is a lot worse than just having your zipper down.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.880
You're suggesting that telling somebody

11:12.880 --> 11:16.080
to examine their zipper is like a warning

11:16.080 --> 11:18.480
that they are just a step away from-

11:18.480 --> 11:21.520
You are walking a razor's edge, my friend.

11:21.520 --> 11:22.160
Yeah.

11:22.160 --> 11:25.840
But is it, I mean, but, oh man.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.280
Sometimes you say things I don't know

11:27.280 --> 11:28.480
if they make sense or not,

11:28.480 --> 11:30.880
and it's hard trying to decode it.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.400
Like what-

11:32.400 --> 11:34.080
I'm just saying it could totally be casual.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.120
Just like, hey, your zipper's down.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.160
They'd be like, oh, thanks, cool.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.440
But you can't be casual, Travis,

11:37.440 --> 11:38.640
because in that sentence,

11:38.640 --> 11:40.400
what you aren't saying at the beginning is,

11:40.400 --> 11:42.480
hey, I was just looking at your dick and I noticed-

11:42.480 --> 11:43.280
Now that's true.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.800
I was giving you, how about I was giving you

11:46.800 --> 11:48.560
a head to toe check.

11:48.560 --> 11:49.280
Yeah.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.600
To see what various articles of clothing

11:51.600 --> 11:52.480
you'd forgotten to finish.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.920
Maybe you can, wait a minute.

11:53.920 --> 11:58.880
Maybe you can trigger some synapse in their brain

11:58.880 --> 12:03.040
that makes them check their crotch while-

12:03.040 --> 12:04.720
Oh, like that's a great belt.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.720
Like in the transaction, right?

12:06.720 --> 12:15.440
Like say, did you want some extra salami on your sandwich?

12:15.440 --> 12:22.480
Did you want that foot long or six inches?

12:23.120 --> 12:24.560
Did you want a sandwich?

12:24.560 --> 12:26.720
Because I can already see you've got a hot dog.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.600
That's the worst thing.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.600
That's the worst.

12:31.600 --> 12:32.080
That was just-

12:32.080 --> 12:33.360
Because of his wiener.

12:33.360 --> 12:33.600
Right.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.560
Oh, right.

12:34.560 --> 12:35.520
Okay, great.

12:35.520 --> 12:35.920
Did you-

12:37.680 --> 12:40.320
Is it just as embarrassing if a woman has her zipper down?

12:41.040 --> 12:42.560
No, I don't think it's just, I don't-

12:43.200 --> 12:43.520
Is it?

12:43.520 --> 12:45.040
Is it? You know the difference?

12:45.600 --> 12:46.000
What?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.360
Women would check.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.760
Because women are like men that just stumble out of the bathroom

12:51.760 --> 12:53.280
and hope everything's okay in there.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.560
Just blindly clawing their way out of the room.

12:56.560 --> 12:57.920
That's how we get through life.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.360
I barely made it.

13:01.360 --> 13:04.000
Anytime a man, Lee, is in a bathroom,

13:04.000 --> 13:07.360
it looks like a Jekyll turning in behind.

13:07.360 --> 13:13.760
Scraping at the walls and just looking for a way out.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.760
I am, every time I go to the bathroom,

13:15.760 --> 13:17.920
I'm basically just racing, right?

13:17.920 --> 13:21.120
Like I'm racing against my ghost from the last lap.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.520
I'm trying to beat my time.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.160
And to that effect, I will just walk out of the bathroom

13:26.160 --> 13:27.440
with my pants around my ankles.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.160
And then hit the stopwatch.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.280
Hit it and go, yes.

13:31.280 --> 13:31.760
Did it.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.440
Shaved off a few precious hundreds.

13:33.440 --> 13:38.800
Do you, this is, I guarantee you that every man has done this.

13:38.800 --> 13:42.640
And I doubt, I hope and pray that no woman has.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.320
Do you guys ever, in the middle of your bathroom ritual,

13:46.320 --> 13:47.920
you know there's something else you need to do,

13:47.920 --> 13:49.760
but God damn it, you're done in there?

13:50.800 --> 13:52.320
You're just done with it.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.840
And that, whatever that thing is,

13:54.400 --> 13:57.200
it's just gonna have to, it's just gonna have to wait.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.760
Whatever thing, whatever part of your ritual

13:59.760 --> 14:01.360
you did not do that morning,

14:01.360 --> 14:03.920
it's just gonna be because you don't want to spend any more time in there.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.720
Usually for me, it's that someone else has just like walked into the bathroom.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.560
Usually someone I don't trust.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.400
What are you, what bathrooms are you in?

14:17.680 --> 14:20.800
You know, just competitive bathrooms.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.280
Is this a player versus player bathroom or?

14:25.280 --> 14:28.480
Are you trying to take my secrets or?

14:28.480 --> 14:31.520
Cooperative bathroom or do we get cubbies?

14:32.400 --> 14:33.680
Griffin, how about a Yahoo?

14:35.280 --> 14:35.520
Sure.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.960
This one was sent in by TheRealNeilOrr.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.040
Thank you, TheRealNeilOrr.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.360
It's by Yahoo Answers user lol, who asks,

14:46.640 --> 14:48.160
do I have a right to do this?

14:49.280 --> 14:51.760
I'm paranoid and I needed to ask this.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.480
If someone is trying to see my imagination

14:54.480 --> 14:57.440
or hear my thoughts or sense my emotions,

14:57.440 --> 15:00.320
do I have a right to make a back off face to them

15:00.320 --> 15:02.080
to make them get out of my head?

15:02.080 --> 15:05.040
I know some people who try to read me and I want to stop it.

15:07.840 --> 15:08.800
Oh my God.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.800
Oh Jesus.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.560
They're afraid they're getting mentalist-ed.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.600
They're getting, they're getting enceived.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.720
They're getting, what, lie to me-ed.

15:19.760 --> 15:20.480
Oh God.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.920
They're looking for micro gestures.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.520
They're getting horse whispered.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.080
Are you trying to horse whisper me?

15:26.080 --> 15:30.400
Are you seeing through my, are you trying to see context in my words?

15:30.400 --> 15:35.680
These thoughts are my own and they usually have to do with apples and sugar

15:35.680 --> 15:37.280
because I'm a pony.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.160
I'm a pony.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.840
That's why it's so easy to be a horse whisperer.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.000
They're only talking about one or two things.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.400
Hey, get off or give me an apple.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.720
I don't even know what to say.

15:52.720 --> 15:57.120
All I can hope is that this person that is feeling this way

15:57.120 --> 16:00.560
is just completely misreading someone like walking up like,

16:00.560 --> 16:01.280
hey, how's it going?

16:01.280 --> 16:02.480
Get out of my head.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.000
These are my emotions.

16:04.000 --> 16:04.640
Whoa.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.480
Hey, whoa.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.120
I just asked you if you wanted extra salami.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.320
I didn't mean anything else.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.760
There's no subtext there.

16:15.600 --> 16:20.720
Is the world we live quietly a psychic battlefield?

16:20.720 --> 16:25.520
People trying to get into your head?

16:25.520 --> 16:30.240
People trying to scope my business, my cranium business

16:30.240 --> 16:33.120
that they don't need to know about, but they're trying to scope it out

16:33.760 --> 16:38.720
and like I'm trying to throw up defensive barriers with my own prowess.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.400
Griffin, it's 2012.

16:43.040 --> 16:47.280
Every minute there are 60 hours of footage uploaded to YouTube.

16:47.280 --> 16:50.800
All we want is for that to be true.

16:50.800 --> 16:54.960
All we want is to pray that someone wants to know what our dreams are.

16:54.960 --> 16:58.480
Please someone be trying to get into my head

16:58.480 --> 17:02.400
because I'm just laying out the welcome mat for you every day

17:02.400 --> 17:05.120
on my channel, Glasses Girl for 2020.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.560
Isn't this what LiveJournal is for?

17:10.560 --> 17:17.280
LiveJournal, Pinterest, any number of social networking sites.

17:17.280 --> 17:23.920
Yeah, my brain is constantly just outputting like a really foul-mouth 12-year-old girl

17:24.480 --> 17:26.480
who's just talking shit about her classmates.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.080
Is that what your internal critic sounds like?

17:30.800 --> 17:31.280
That is.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.840
I call her a little shoddy.

17:33.840 --> 17:43.200
When Griffin makes it huge, when you get big, you gotta have a vanity cartoon.

17:43.200 --> 17:48.400
Wayne Head, Hammer Man, Wish Kid.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.280
You make it big, you get a vanity cartoon.

17:51.280 --> 17:54.480
Griffin's vanity cartoon is gonna be Little Shoddy

17:54.480 --> 17:57.440
featuring Wanda Sykes as the voice of Little Shoddy

17:57.440 --> 18:04.720
and Griffin will write all the scripts himself in the last three episodes, short lived.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.760
Doesn't need to be long to be a good vanity cartoon.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.040
Everybody gets one, not only Griffin's.

18:12.080 --> 18:16.720
My internal critic is Rupert Giles from Buffy the Vampire Slayer

18:16.720 --> 18:21.200
and whenever I have, no matter what entertainment or media I'm taking in,

18:21.200 --> 18:24.160
he's always disappointed in me.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.440
That's not a goof.

18:25.440 --> 18:29.200
I just, I feel guilty all the time that I'm not reading books.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.640
Sometimes for me it's Wanda Sykes, sometimes it's Maggie Sykes,

18:34.640 --> 18:37.360
sometimes they're together and they're just not.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.760
I would watch that buddy comedy all day long.

18:39.760 --> 18:40.320
Oh man.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.760
They made it, it's called Taxi.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.920
I don't have an internal critic.

18:45.920 --> 18:46.560
Okay.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.360
Is that normal?

18:47.360 --> 18:49.520
You have a lot of external ones.

18:49.520 --> 18:54.560
That's a good balance, right?

18:56.800 --> 18:58.400
Everybody get out of everybody's heads.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.160
We're just trying to live day to day.

19:00.720 --> 19:01.440
Get out of there.

19:02.880 --> 19:07.600
Hey, I have been with my official, there it is.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.240
I just podcasted so hard that I got winded.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.200
Wrapping it up anytime now.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.400
I mean my life.

19:14.400 --> 19:18.000
I have been official with my boyfriend for almost two months and things are great.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.440
However, there's one problem.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.440
My best friend, who is a girl,

19:21.440 --> 19:22.320
His best friend.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.000
His best friend, who is a girl,

19:25.280 --> 19:27.680
who has been desperately in love with him for the past two and a half years.

19:28.320 --> 19:31.760
Although they go to school together and my college is three hours away,

19:31.760 --> 19:33.120
I do not feel threatened by her.

19:35.440 --> 19:39.840
My issue comes from her refusal to recognize and respect my role in his life.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.040
When I go to visit him at school, she will drop by.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.320
I refuse to leave and throw little jabs and backhanded comments my way.

19:46.320 --> 19:49.120
I've told my boyfriend that these things make me uncomfortable,

19:49.120 --> 19:50.880
but he sees nothing wrong with it.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.120
Although he never reciprocates her affections,

19:53.120 --> 19:56.640
he won't tell her that her behavior is both intrusive and appropriate.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.280
Perhaps I'm overreacting, but it's really getting on my nerves

19:59.280 --> 20:02.000
and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold my tongue and play nice.

20:02.000 --> 20:02.960
What do I do?

20:02.960 --> 20:03.600
Olivia.

20:05.680 --> 20:10.880
Olivia, you need someone in your life who is going to give you the straight dope

20:10.880 --> 20:13.440
and you're lucky because we are here for you.

20:13.440 --> 20:18.960
You need to bounce the ripcord and bounce.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.520
Yeah, because I'll tell you what, here's my take on it.

20:21.520 --> 20:25.200
Your boyfriend is addicted to this girl's attention.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.800
Oh yeah, he loves it.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.240
Because she's so nice to him and says all these nice things

20:30.240 --> 20:33.120
and is just so in love with him for the last two and a half years.

20:33.840 --> 20:37.440
Anybody that realizes their best friend is like desperately in love with him

20:37.440 --> 20:40.800
for that amount of time and doesn't back away from the situation

20:40.800 --> 20:44.240
or putting into it is just loving the attention.

20:44.240 --> 20:44.740
Yeah.

20:45.680 --> 20:49.600
The extent to which you need to bounce is incalculable.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.760
Like, you need to trust us on this one.

20:52.320 --> 20:56.080
We can tell you why you need to bounce, but you have got to bounce.

20:56.720 --> 20:57.760
Yeah, you gotta go.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.040
I mean, this is so obvious.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.520
I don't mean to- you gotta go.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.400
This thing's done- I was- I was rereading the email

21:04.400 --> 21:07.520
because if you've been dating for like, you know, 20 years,

21:07.520 --> 21:09.280
then maybe you should reconcile.

21:09.280 --> 21:12.160
But two months and this- no.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.120
No, no, no, no.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.640
This is my main issue with it.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.040
That she like talked to her boyfriend and said like,

21:17.040 --> 21:18.080
hey, this isn't cool.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.680
And he was like, ah, it's fine.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.040
I think it's cool.

21:21.040 --> 21:21.760
Time to get out.

21:22.320 --> 21:22.960
Go, go, go.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.160
Men and women can be friends.

21:24.160 --> 21:25.200
Didn't you see Will and Grace?

21:26.400 --> 21:27.360
That's a bad example.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.080
My best friend's wedding.

21:30.080 --> 21:30.960
Oh wait.

21:30.960 --> 21:31.760
You, me, and Dupree.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.440
You got a lady dupe.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.760
And you have to- you have to get out of this situation.

21:37.760 --> 21:38.400
You have to.

21:38.400 --> 21:43.600
Olivia, you are in the story of their relationship.

21:44.240 --> 21:47.360
She is the Kate Hudson and you are the-

21:48.080 --> 21:48.560
Baxter.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.800
You are about to get Baxtered so hard.

21:50.800 --> 21:51.760
You're Baxtered.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.120
You need to- yeah.

21:53.120 --> 21:53.920
It's brutal.

21:53.920 --> 21:58.960
You need to get out because you- this is not going to end well.

21:58.960 --> 21:59.920
This is bad.

21:59.920 --> 22:00.800
This is really bad.

22:00.800 --> 22:07.280
And the fact that she's even around right now is wholly unacceptable.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.960
Because one of two things is going to happen.

22:08.960 --> 22:14.720
Like, she's going to win him or you're going to find your tires slashed or something.

22:14.720 --> 22:19.280
Yeah, she's going to go full-blown swim fan and burn your apartment down.

22:20.080 --> 22:22.880
If you had told us before you got into this relationship that you were going to date

22:22.880 --> 22:27.280
someone that lives three hours away, we would have very sternly warded you off from it.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.960
We would have said, no, that's a bad idea.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.680
Now, we honestly have to put our foots- feet down.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.720
Collective feet.

22:32.720 --> 22:33.680
And our foots.

22:33.680 --> 22:34.160
And our foots.

22:34.160 --> 22:39.840
Yes, all three foots on the ground say that you can't do this, Olivia.

22:39.840 --> 22:40.720
You're too good for him.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.640
Too good for this situation.

22:42.640 --> 22:43.920
It's not him, even.

22:43.920 --> 22:50.080
It's not- it's- I mean, it is him because he obviously needs to grow up and have some

22:50.080 --> 22:53.040
emotional maturity and make some boundaries with this girl.

22:53.040 --> 22:53.280
Yeah.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.040
What is she even doing around?

22:55.040 --> 22:57.680
If you see each other- if you live three hours away, it can't be rare.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.360
You know, it's gotta be a rare thing that you guys get to spend time together.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.560
What is she even doing there?

23:02.560 --> 23:03.360
That's what I'm saying.

23:03.360 --> 23:06.800
And the fact that your boyfriend doesn't see any problem with that, and when you confront

23:06.800 --> 23:09.440
him about it, he's like, nah, it's fine.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.600
Like, that's such an issue for me.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.160
We cool.

23:14.480 --> 23:14.960
We cool.

23:15.760 --> 23:16.320
You're not.

23:16.320 --> 23:16.880
You're not cool.

23:18.000 --> 23:18.880
Bounce.

23:18.880 --> 23:22.800
This is- because if you put it in any other context, like, I never get to see my boyfriend,

23:22.800 --> 23:26.160
but then when I do, all he does is sit there and read a book.

23:26.160 --> 23:28.000
All he does is sit there and play video games.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.080
Like, if he can't divide himself from this girl long enough to just hang out with you

23:32.080 --> 23:36.080
when you actually get to visit, like, that's an issue.

23:39.280 --> 23:39.920
Absolutely.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.400
And you know what else is an issue?

23:44.240 --> 23:44.740
Money.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.360
I mean, I guess.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.480
People need it.

23:48.480 --> 23:49.280
People need it?

23:49.280 --> 23:50.480
I guess.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.000
And people want it.

23:52.000 --> 24:02.800
Money's out.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.640
This message is for who, Travis?

24:05.360 --> 24:07.600
Well, this first message is for Ashley Metcalf.

24:08.720 --> 24:09.360
Oh.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.960
And it's from Mom, Buddy, Brandy, and Kristen.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.440
And they say, happy 28th birthday.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.960
They're going to have a listening party tonight, which is awesome.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.080
So happy birthday.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.120
You're listening right now.

24:24.320 --> 24:27.120
And yeah, so Ashley, it's her birthday.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.400
She's the youngest of three girls.

24:28.400 --> 24:33.120
She has a dog named Butters, and she loves MBMBAM and unicorns.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.040
Two great tastes that taste great together.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.840
We are the unicorn of podcasts.

24:37.840 --> 24:40.400
So happy birthday to you, Ashley.

24:40.400 --> 24:46.320
She asked for a jingle, but we took this pretty firm position on only giving jingles to businesses

24:46.320 --> 24:47.760
and not people because that's weird.

24:47.760 --> 24:52.160
So instead, because it's your birthday, I'll give you the title of a jingle,

24:52.160 --> 24:53.680
and it would have been birthday boo.

24:54.240 --> 24:57.120
But now that's over, but you have to make up the song yourself.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.440
That's just a leaping off point.

24:59.440 --> 25:03.920
So once you start Ashley Metcalf Incorporated, Griffin will do a jingle for you.

25:03.920 --> 25:04.480
Yes.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.280
Who else we got on the old birthday calendar, Trav?

25:08.080 --> 25:11.040
We've also got Sarah of Melbourne, Australia.

25:11.040 --> 25:14.640
And that comes from Tom, also of Melbourne, Australia.

25:14.640 --> 25:20.240
And Tom wishes Sarah a happy Valentine's Day and birthday and three-year anniversary combo.

25:20.240 --> 25:23.440
So he's getting three wishes for the price of one.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.480
It's a great deal.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.000
We should have charged him triple.

25:26.720 --> 25:30.720
In fact, we now will retroactively charge him triple.

25:32.720 --> 25:36.400
He says that she's secretly in love with me, which I'm not.

25:36.400 --> 25:40.640
I don't really want to do any internet cuckolding today.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.200
Thank you.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.720
I will just...

25:42.720 --> 25:46.880
I will just hang out and not do that.

25:46.880 --> 25:47.520
But thank you.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.960
But no, but I appreciate the offer.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.240
And we would be remiss.

25:54.240 --> 25:58.800
So happy birthday, Valentine's Day anniversary to Sarah of Melbourne.

25:59.360 --> 26:04.080
You know what makes a great gift for anybody, any occasion?

26:04.080 --> 26:04.880
Eternal love.

26:04.880 --> 26:05.760
Eternal love.

26:05.760 --> 26:07.920
And barring that is the gift of time.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.240
And barring that is the gift of economy.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.640
And barring that is the gift of environmental awareness.

26:12.640 --> 26:17.120
And you can give all three to people with a brand new project called Stack.

26:18.080 --> 26:25.040
Stack is a revolutionary concept in the world of soap stuff.

26:25.040 --> 26:26.880
You know, like soap, soapery.

26:26.880 --> 26:30.480
It's a revolutionary soapery concept.

26:30.480 --> 26:31.360
Soapistry.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.080
Soapistry.

26:32.960 --> 26:38.400
So basically what Stack soap is, it's a bar of soap that has a divot on the top.

26:38.400 --> 26:44.320
And as you wear it down, what we've trademarked is called the stupid sliver.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.680
You end up with a stupid sliver.

26:45.680 --> 26:48.560
And usually you throw that away or you slip on it and die.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.600
With Stack soap, sorry.

26:51.600 --> 26:52.160
No death.

26:52.160 --> 26:53.200
It's a murder sliver.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.040
You're washing your body with it.

26:55.040 --> 26:55.920
You're washing your butt.

26:55.920 --> 26:59.200
And your butt swallows the sliver of soap because it's so tiny.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.080
Then you get sick.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.280
So Stack soap is built with a divot.

27:03.280 --> 27:07.360
And when you use a bar of Stack soap, it wears down so it fits exactly in that divot.

27:07.360 --> 27:11.280
So when you just have a murder sliver, you slap it into a new bar.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.560
You don't waste any soap.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.360
And you're back off to the races.

27:15.360 --> 27:19.360
And when you get another sliver, you slap it into the next bar.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.320
I have had a bar.

27:21.120 --> 27:26.320
Founder Eric sent me a few bars and I've been using it.

27:26.320 --> 27:30.960
I feel like I've never been clean before, which is unsettling.

27:30.960 --> 27:34.880
But also, you know, I'm glad to discover it now before I'm in my 40s.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.120
Can you describe the scent to me?

27:38.000 --> 27:41.200
Yes, the bars he sent me were prototypes and unscented.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.440
So it smells like clean.

27:43.440 --> 27:44.720
So it smells clean.

27:44.720 --> 27:45.520
It's a very clean scent.

27:45.520 --> 27:50.800
Anyway, he was looking for money to get a copper dye to make these bars.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.000
You need nine grand.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.520
You guys are insane people.

27:54.080 --> 27:57.360
And you have fully funded his project.

27:58.320 --> 27:59.760
The Kickstarter is fully funded.

28:00.800 --> 28:04.480
And because you guys were tweeting and talking about it, the story was picked up by like

28:04.480 --> 28:07.760
Boing Boing and Gizmodo and a few other sites.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.920
So you guys are, as always, the best.

28:10.560 --> 28:13.200
Thank you for proving that we are an economical juggernaut.

28:13.200 --> 28:16.720
We are a huge powerhouse in the world of internet soapistry.

28:17.840 --> 28:22.800
Now, Griffin, you've been working on a jingle for Stack Soap.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.560
Can you give us an update on that?

28:24.560 --> 28:30.960
Yeah, you know, I'm all about, right now, I'm just sort of oscillating between themes,

28:30.960 --> 28:37.600
um, between genres, you know, between, like, there's a lot of cleanness, I think, has a

28:37.600 --> 28:40.400
lot of implications in the poetical sense.

28:40.400 --> 28:41.360
Do you know what I mean?

28:41.360 --> 28:45.040
Yeah, there was a few words that weren't words in there, but please go on.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.840
So I'm trying to find, I'm trying to, like, find the sign.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.040
There's like a lot of ether.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.280
I'm not used to this much ether when I create.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.480
Sure, yeah, yeah.

28:52.480 --> 28:56.080
And so, like, my net, I have to refine my net so that the ether.

28:56.880 --> 28:58.640
So where's your net at right now?

28:58.640 --> 29:05.760
Like, right now, I'm thinking, like, a southern, southern rock, southern rock, and, like, the,

29:05.760 --> 29:10.000
it's all about getting clean, you know, but, like, the cleanness is also a metaphor for

29:10.000 --> 29:12.960
love, human, human love between people.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.240
So what's that sound like?

29:14.240 --> 29:14.880
So, like,

29:14.880 --> 29:28.480
Put your soap in my soap.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.440
That's all I have so far.

29:29.440 --> 29:30.480
Okay.

29:30.480 --> 29:33.440
Put your soap in my soap.

29:33.440 --> 29:33.920
I like it.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.480
You know, I think you just repeat that for, like,

29:36.480 --> 29:38.560
Put your soap in my soap.

29:38.560 --> 29:47.360
And we'll both get clean together, Stack Soap.

29:49.760 --> 29:52.320
I think we could work out a pretty tight harmony for that, too.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.800
Yeah, I think we're really close on that.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.200
So stacksoap.com again is the address.

29:58.240 --> 30:04.080
And right now we got a word from another Max Fun show that may or may not be trying to sell you soap.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.040
I'm Jesse Thorne.

30:07.040 --> 30:10.960
Bullseye is all about discovering the good stuff in culture that will do

30:10.960 --> 30:13.440
nothing less than change your life.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.040
You know, I've never heard anything like it before.

30:15.040 --> 30:19.680
It'd be like seeing a new color, which I guess is music's, like, biggest asset,

30:19.680 --> 30:20.880
is that you can hear new sounds.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.240
I'll probably never see a new color.

30:22.240 --> 30:27.680
I'll probably never experience, like, a new crazy taste, but I'll hear new sounds constantly.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.800
Culture picks, comedy, and in-depth interviews.

30:30.800 --> 30:38.480
It's the good stuff and just the good stuff in popular culture every week on Bullseye.

Subscribe to iTunes or find it online at MaximumFun.org.

30:42.720 --> 30:44.240
Do you want to come back with a Yahoo?

30:44.240 --> 30:47.680
Yeah, I want to come back to the comedy with Yahoo.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.720
This one was sent in by Kit Recca, which is a pretty good name.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.640
It was asked by Avatartar Sauce.

30:54.640 --> 30:55.200
It's pretty good.

30:56.400 --> 30:56.800
Who asked?

30:56.800 --> 30:57.760
Clever.

30:57.760 --> 30:58.800
Sure, I like it.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.720
How big is love?

31:01.440 --> 31:04.000
How do you condense love into measurable units?

31:04.720 --> 31:06.560
My girlfriend asked me how much I love her.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.680
I don't know how to tell her because I don't know the formula of love,

31:09.680 --> 31:11.840
and I don't know a lot about how to measure love.

31:13.360 --> 31:18.720
The correct answer is this much, and then put your hands an appropriate distance apart.

31:18.720 --> 31:22.240
It sounds like the lyrics to the worst Coasters song ever.

31:22.240 --> 31:29.600
It sounds like a really shitty Doo-Wop tune, like B-side maybe to Who Wrote the Book of Love.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.520
How do you quantify the relative side?

31:31.520 --> 31:32.880
Who made the ruler of love?

31:33.920 --> 31:34.480
I have found-

31:34.480 --> 31:36.400
Who made the graduated cylinder of love?

31:37.200 --> 31:43.920
The closest approximate metric from what I found is Scoville units.

31:43.920 --> 31:44.640
Okay.

31:44.640 --> 31:44.960
Okay.

31:45.520 --> 31:49.440
Now, is that a word you've heard or do you actually know what that concept represents?

31:49.440 --> 31:53.200
A Scoville unit is the measurement of heat in peppers.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.080
Okay, right.

31:54.080 --> 31:54.720
Do you know what I mean?

31:55.280 --> 31:56.720
Measure the capsaicin?

31:56.720 --> 31:59.840
It may not work for everyone, but my love has a sort of,

32:00.480 --> 32:03.920
I wouldn't say Latino fire, but I would say it.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.360
I did, so it's out there.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.560
You did say it, right.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.760
So that's how I like to think.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.160
And also Scoville units, the measurements are really high.

32:12.160 --> 32:15.680
A Habanero I think has like two million Scovles.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.720
That's shorthand for Scoville units.

32:18.720 --> 32:24.160
So that's sort of what I'm working with for my particular brand of love.

32:24.160 --> 32:25.840
I would have said stone.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.280
Okay, I like that.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.720
Because nobody knows how much it really is and it's so mysterious.

32:32.160 --> 32:35.600
I like that, the thing that works for me about the Scoville units

32:35.600 --> 32:38.960
is that there are some real relatable peppers

32:38.960 --> 32:42.080
that you can just directly connect that to.

32:42.080 --> 32:44.720
Like girl, my love is like the ghost chili.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.480
Oh, that's, yeah.

32:46.480 --> 32:49.840
Oh, and then you could say like we've calmed down to like a green pepper.

32:49.840 --> 32:53.120
Right now I feel like this is more like a green pepper or a cayenne.

32:53.920 --> 32:55.760
Oh, and that's how you know it's like,

32:55.760 --> 32:59.600
okay, well we've calmed down to like friend Scoville units.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.760
And then you'd be like, baby, we are banana peppers.

33:01.760 --> 33:03.520
And then that's how you break up.

33:05.680 --> 33:06.400
We're like milk.

33:07.440 --> 33:08.640
We're zero scoves.

33:09.280 --> 33:12.560
We actually cool other people's love when they drink us.

33:12.560 --> 33:15.760
Just to be in our presence kills other people's love.

33:15.760 --> 33:21.600
Yeah, we're the opposite of love, whatever that is.

33:22.560 --> 33:24.560
They need to come up with an opposite of love.

33:25.360 --> 33:26.400
How about it, wordsmiths?

33:31.040 --> 33:31.760
Not the love.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.000
Even with all your science,

33:36.000 --> 33:39.760
you still haven't been able to come up with a word that's the opposite of love.

33:39.760 --> 33:43.280
Yeah, it's pretty despicable.

33:43.280 --> 33:47.040
You know, you think about Shakespeare.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.000
Shakespeare created eyeball.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.280
He created the word puking.

33:51.840 --> 33:52.960
Green-eyed monster.

33:52.960 --> 33:53.760
Skim milk.

33:54.480 --> 33:55.280
Obscene.

33:55.280 --> 33:55.760
That's all-

33:55.760 --> 33:56.400
Luggage.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.160
That's all created by Shakespeare.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.560
Couldn't come up with the opposite of love.

34:00.560 --> 34:01.280
Pinterest.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.160
He did not.

34:04.720 --> 34:05.120
He did.

34:05.120 --> 34:10.800
He was talking about someone, I think it was in Two Gentlemen of Verona,

34:10.800 --> 34:14.400
where he says her practicing her sartorial craft,

34:15.680 --> 34:19.920
she had a lot of Pinterest because she had a lot of interest in pins.

34:21.200 --> 34:23.840
The other gentleman of Verona responds,

34:23.840 --> 34:27.680
it's not that she loved her, he opposite of loved her.

34:30.080 --> 34:30.960
He didn't.

34:30.960 --> 34:34.720
He did opposite, then he vomits and blacks out for six hours.

34:34.720 --> 34:38.640
It's his longest play as a result.

34:38.640 --> 34:43.040
In lots of theaters, they cut that.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.920
They trim it down to three hours of vomiting and blacking out.

34:45.920 --> 34:48.720
Well, you can usually just turn it into like a dream ballet

34:49.280 --> 34:51.200
that kind of conveys the time.

34:51.200 --> 34:53.200
Or you do like a War of the Roses kind of thing.

34:53.200 --> 34:55.200
You're like, hey, buckle in, audience.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.880
Yeah, purists do the whole thing.

34:56.880 --> 35:00.160
This is a three-hour song about social networking platforms.

35:01.840 --> 35:04.080
I am Barbeque in the Tumblr.

35:04.080 --> 35:06.080
I am Sarah.

35:07.680 --> 35:10.160
Lord Steven of LiveJournal.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.800
I don't know what's happening.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.600
I would like to have been there on this day

35:15.600 --> 35:18.640
when this girlfriend asked this guy how much he loved her,

35:18.640 --> 35:21.360
and he responded, I don't know.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.840
I have to go to Yahoo Answers.

35:23.840 --> 35:24.560
A hundred?

35:26.240 --> 35:28.160
I literally can't quantify it.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.200
How big is a house?

35:29.200 --> 35:32.720
We have an opportunity here not to equate it to another metric,

35:32.720 --> 35:35.280
but to come up with our own metric

35:35.280 --> 35:38.480
that we can think about how much money we can make off of that

35:38.480 --> 35:39.760
if we sold that shit to Hallmark.

35:39.760 --> 35:42.640
And we just said like, you know, 50 billion?

35:43.200 --> 35:43.680
Throbs.

35:43.680 --> 35:44.720
Throbs.

35:44.720 --> 35:46.560
Throbs is so good.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.760
I'm mad that we were gonna have this whole riff

35:49.760 --> 35:51.440
and Travis just nailed it right out of the gate.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.600
It's Throbs, obviously.

35:53.600 --> 35:57.440
It's sexual, but it's also heart-related.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.680
Yep.

35:59.680 --> 36:03.760
Okay, so zero throbs is just utter indifference.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.440
And negative throbs, is that hatred,

36:05.440 --> 36:06.640
or does hatred have its own...

36:07.200 --> 36:08.320
Now, what is hatred?

36:08.320 --> 36:09.120
What is hatred?

36:09.120 --> 36:10.800
I'm sorry, I forgot the goof.

36:18.080 --> 36:18.800
Dullard.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.800
I'm not even gonna do your throb goof now

36:20.800 --> 36:22.480
because you ruined my goof.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.560
No, this is, no, Justin, this is such a...

36:24.560 --> 36:27.120
Please don't take this out on your money-making opportunity

36:27.120 --> 36:28.400
that we have in front of us.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.880
At once a season, I get a goof veto

36:30.880 --> 36:35.200
and I'm using it to veto his goof as a punishment

36:35.200 --> 36:37.360
for you unintentionally killing my goof

36:38.320 --> 36:39.920
in the annals of goofdom.

36:39.920 --> 36:43.520
This is like a goof end of Reservoir Dogs.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.640
Travis is cutting a goof ear off.

36:52.160 --> 36:52.640
Dancing.

36:54.080 --> 36:54.320
Fuck.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.560
Fuck, say your dumb thing about throbs.

36:57.920 --> 36:59.360
I'm just trying to come up with,

36:59.360 --> 37:02.080
for our listeners to use with their lovers,

37:03.040 --> 37:05.520
I just want us to come up with some sort of metric.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.920
We founded the term, Travis founded the term.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.520
Let's come up with some numbers.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.200
So zero is indifference.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.320
That's how I feel about like Kevin Costner.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.080
Like fine, he can do his thing.

37:16.080 --> 37:16.480
What is...

37:16.480 --> 37:19.600
Okay, so then it's like friendship is maybe,

37:20.160 --> 37:21.840
maybe a hundred?

37:21.840 --> 37:24.320
A hundred throbs?

37:24.320 --> 37:25.440
Why have a scale though?

37:25.440 --> 37:26.800
Like what's in between those two?

37:27.360 --> 37:28.480
I mean, there's a lot of stuff.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.240
Acquaintance, business partner.

37:30.240 --> 37:31.760
And there's levels of friendship.

37:31.760 --> 37:34.800
You can be like, we're like go to lunch friends

37:34.800 --> 37:37.280
and that's like 75 throbs.

37:39.280 --> 37:41.600
It's nice because everybody's always saying love

37:42.400 --> 37:43.680
and the word doesn't mean anything.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.040
Let's get some numbers attached to it.

37:45.040 --> 37:45.840
That's what I'm trying.

37:45.840 --> 37:46.160
Thank you.

37:46.160 --> 37:49.600
Welcome to the team building exercise.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.880
A thousand I think should be friends of Benny's.

37:54.960 --> 37:55.520
You know what I mean?

37:56.560 --> 38:02.320
I think that pure and beautiful love clocks in around 10,000.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.040
But 10,000 is like,

38:05.600 --> 38:08.320
that's the kind of love that only your grandparents have

38:09.120 --> 38:11.120
because they know what sacrifice is.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.720
Like your pap, pap killed the Nazis

38:14.720 --> 38:16.720
so he can love a lot harder than you.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.520
The only way that you can reach 10,000

38:19.520 --> 38:21.200
is if you've been married to the same person

38:21.200 --> 38:22.640
for more than 50 years

38:22.640 --> 38:24.640
and also one of you has been to war

38:24.640 --> 38:25.840
and you know the loss.

38:27.120 --> 38:27.840
I like this.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.680
I like not only putting a number to it,

38:29.680 --> 38:31.680
but putting restrictions to it.

38:31.680 --> 38:34.160
So when someone's like, I love you 9,000 throbs

38:34.160 --> 38:35.200
and you're like, no, you don't

38:35.840 --> 38:37.920
because you didn't grow up in the same town

38:37.920 --> 38:39.200
next door to each other.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.400
So sorry.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.080
How do we measure it though?

38:42.080 --> 38:44.000
Is there a device like a meat thermometer

38:44.000 --> 38:45.600
we can just plug into our hearts and know?

38:45.600 --> 38:46.320
Mm-hmm.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.360
It's a meat thermometer.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.440
Hey, stab yourself at this.

38:51.440 --> 38:52.400
I gotta know.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.520
I gotta test it.

38:53.520 --> 38:53.920
Right in the heart.

38:53.920 --> 38:55.680
You know those things they put in turkeys

38:55.680 --> 38:57.760
that you know it's done because it pops out?

38:57.760 --> 38:58.000
Yeah.

38:58.000 --> 38:58.880
It's like that.

38:58.880 --> 38:59.120
Yeah.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.040
It's like when you do your tire pressure

39:01.040 --> 39:02.480
and it shoots out a certain amount

39:02.480 --> 39:05.600
and you're like, oh, it looks like you're at about 5,000 throbs.

39:06.560 --> 39:07.920
You guys are getting along well.

39:07.920 --> 39:08.640
I wish that,

39:10.400 --> 39:12.880
I think I'm just gonna stick to measuring my wife's love

39:12.880 --> 39:14.320
the way I always have

39:14.320 --> 39:17.120
and that's asking her to see a movie with Jason Statham in it.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.520
What about the day when she one day says no?

39:21.520 --> 39:24.400
That joke was actually donated to me by Ray Romano.

39:24.400 --> 39:29.520
So I definitely want to thank him for all his.

39:29.520 --> 39:33.120
Everybody like 4,000 throbs Raymond.

39:33.120 --> 39:33.680
You know what I mean?

39:35.520 --> 39:37.040
Everybody throbs Raymond.

39:38.320 --> 39:41.200
That impression was the claim.

39:41.200 --> 39:41.920
Was that the brother?

39:42.560 --> 39:43.520
That was the brother.

39:43.520 --> 39:53.760
Raymond's brother sounds like a vogue on Nightmare.

39:55.760 --> 39:59.360
Hey, I have found that I become too emotionally invested

39:59.360 --> 40:00.880
in television book series.

40:00.880 --> 40:03.280
I tend to overload myself in the beginning

40:03.280 --> 40:04.960
like when I discovered Doctor Who

40:04.960 --> 40:07.040
and it consumed my every waking moment

40:07.040 --> 40:09.440
and then feel empty and sad when they're over

40:09.440 --> 40:11.200
or I'm caught up to the current season.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.880
I don't know what to fill this void with

40:12.880 --> 40:14.800
besides more television and book series.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.240
Do you guys have any suggestions?

40:16.240 --> 40:18.400
That's from Immoderate in Indianapolis.

40:20.240 --> 40:22.000
I wish I knew the answer to this.

40:23.760 --> 40:27.520
Travis is the king of just he'll call.

40:27.520 --> 40:29.360
You'll suggest a new show to him

40:29.360 --> 40:31.120
and he'll call you at like three in the morning.

40:31.120 --> 40:33.120
Like, well, I watched All Upon Stars.

40:33.120 --> 40:35.520
Yeah, like literally I will consume them

40:36.960 --> 40:39.280
to non-existence like to the point where I use it all up

40:39.280 --> 40:40.480
and no one else can enjoy it.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.280
It's like for me, it's like, I can't be,

40:43.280 --> 40:47.440
I can't be, my work ethic goes right out the window

40:47.440 --> 40:49.920
when I know that there's TV that I should be watching.

40:50.560 --> 40:51.280
You know what I mean?

40:51.280 --> 40:54.560
Like I've watched four episodes of Game of Thrones

40:54.560 --> 40:56.720
and all I want to do is watch the rest of them.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.320
But I'm trying to savor the experience,

40:58.320 --> 41:00.560
but it's literally while we've been doing this podcast

41:00.560 --> 41:02.880
all I can think about is that show.

41:03.520 --> 41:05.200
You know, what I found funny is

41:05.200 --> 41:06.640
I love when something like that happens

41:06.640 --> 41:09.440
and it gets put in perspective for you

41:09.440 --> 41:11.440
because like I had never seen that as weird,

41:11.440 --> 41:12.720
like just sitting down and like,

41:12.720 --> 41:14.080
well, I've got today off,

41:14.080 --> 41:17.920
I'm gonna watch every episode of season three of Doctor Who, right?

41:18.800 --> 41:21.040
And then when I started living with Teresa,

41:21.040 --> 41:22.320
she would come home and be like,

41:22.320 --> 41:24.800
you were on the couch watching Doctor Who when I left.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.640
I was like, yeah, I've been doing it all day.

41:26.640 --> 41:28.400
And she was just horrified.

41:28.400 --> 41:29.920
Like, how do you do that?

41:30.880 --> 41:31.600
The good news is-

41:31.600 --> 41:33.520
And then I realized it was weird.

41:33.520 --> 41:34.800
The good news is that you've already found

41:34.800 --> 41:35.840
the answer to your question.

41:35.840 --> 41:38.720
You have to just move on to the next thing.

41:38.720 --> 41:39.040
Yeah.

41:39.040 --> 41:42.480
You just soak up the radiance of the next thing.

41:42.480 --> 41:43.680
You gotta be constantly on the hunt.

41:43.680 --> 41:44.560
That's why we got Twitter.

41:45.760 --> 41:46.800
You know what dad does?

41:46.800 --> 41:49.200
Our dad does something that's always blown my mind.

41:49.200 --> 41:51.360
And I first noticed it when we go on vacation.

41:51.360 --> 41:51.680
Hi, dad.

41:51.680 --> 41:54.480
He will simultaneously read like five books.

41:55.360 --> 41:56.400
And that blows my mind.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.960
That idea of like, not just one book that you're glued to.

41:58.960 --> 42:00.400
Like he'll read a chapter of one,

42:00.400 --> 42:02.160
set it down and pick up another one

42:02.160 --> 42:03.840
and read a chapter of that one

42:03.840 --> 42:05.440
and set that down and pick up a different.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.720
It's amazing.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.320
He has an apparatus that he built

42:08.320 --> 42:11.600
that allows him to read and turn the pages of five books at once

42:11.600 --> 42:13.280
that he reads with compound eyes.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.960
Our dad has compound eyes.

42:14.960 --> 42:16.800
I have a hard enough time

42:16.800 --> 42:19.520
finding one books that brain giles won't disapprove of

42:19.520 --> 42:21.760
let alone five that I can read concurrently.

42:21.760 --> 42:22.560
So maybe that's it.

42:22.560 --> 42:24.560
Maybe pick like different shows

42:24.560 --> 42:28.560
and try to like cut Dr. Who with Storage Wars.

42:29.760 --> 42:31.440
Cut it, you know, and break it up a little bit.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.800
Getting married helps us too.

42:34.800 --> 42:40.240
Because when I conned my wife into watching Battlestar,

42:40.240 --> 42:41.680
she ended up really liking it.

42:41.680 --> 42:43.200
But at first when you're like,

42:44.080 --> 42:46.160
and then this and then it's on space

42:46.160 --> 42:47.600
and then it's old timey.

42:47.600 --> 42:50.960
And as the captain, it's Edward James almost.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.640
It's kind of a hard pitch.

42:52.640 --> 42:56.400
So we had to watch Dawson's Creek alongside of it,

42:56.400 --> 42:58.480
which is good because it took us longer

42:58.480 --> 42:59.440
to get through both of them.

43:00.240 --> 43:02.640
And now Dawson's Creek, of course, went on a lot longer.

43:02.640 --> 43:05.040
So we're burning through those.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.320
You got got though.

43:06.320 --> 43:07.280
I got goofed.

43:07.280 --> 43:10.400
Yeah, it was a dirty trick, but I fell for it.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.720
Cause I do, cause that's my job.

43:12.720 --> 43:13.920
And I think that's another thing,

43:14.880 --> 43:16.640
watching something with someone.

43:17.200 --> 43:19.600
So you have to like also match their schedule

43:19.600 --> 43:22.080
cause like Teresa and I've been watching Downton Abbey.

43:22.080 --> 43:23.360
That's how you do it, yeah.

43:23.360 --> 43:25.680
Yeah, and because like we have two different schedules,

43:26.400 --> 43:28.160
it's like, hey, let's find a special time

43:28.160 --> 43:29.840
to watch an episode together

43:29.840 --> 43:31.920
instead of like, well, she's off to work.

43:31.920 --> 43:33.760
I'm gonna burn through the day watching,

43:33.760 --> 43:35.040
you know, every episode or something.

43:35.040 --> 43:38.800
You really, really can't enjoy a show like that.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.000
You really, if you watch,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.240
if you spend an entire day watching the show,

43:42.240 --> 43:43.840
it's not a special anymore.

43:43.840 --> 43:46.480
But now whenever new episodes of Downton Abbey come out,

43:46.480 --> 43:48.000
like I watch them with my girlfriend

43:48.000 --> 43:49.120
and it's like an event.

43:49.120 --> 43:52.080
It's like an exciting thing that I get so excited for.

43:52.080 --> 43:54.240
And when I said Downton Abbey, I meant The Bachelor.

43:58.240 --> 44:00.400
I wish we could talk about The Bachelor together because

44:00.960 --> 44:01.600
We can't.

44:01.600 --> 44:04.960
I wanna, I need to air out some grievances

44:04.960 --> 44:05.920
I have with Courtney.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.360
Okay, well, I'll just take a headset off.

44:09.360 --> 44:11.200
Hey, you can talk about it if I can pretend

44:11.200 --> 44:12.640
like you're talking about flavor of love.

44:13.760 --> 44:15.280
Can you switch the names around?

44:15.280 --> 44:17.040
Just replace all the girls with New York.

44:17.040 --> 44:18.560
How many pushups should I be able to do?

44:18.560 --> 44:20.160
I'm 30 and a guy.

44:20.160 --> 44:20.880
Thanks, brothers.

44:22.320 --> 44:23.840
There's only one way to solve this, right?

44:25.040 --> 44:26.720
All three of us do pushups right now to see how many.

44:26.720 --> 44:29.040
Yeah, we got to do pushups right now and see how we do.

44:29.040 --> 44:30.640
I can't, I just got to type.

44:30.640 --> 44:32.160
Only if we can edit it out later,

44:32.160 --> 44:34.720
because I feel like it's only good if we can come back

44:34.720 --> 44:36.800
and say like 800.

44:36.800 --> 44:38.160
Okay, all right, here we go.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.840
800.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.600
800, I did 800 too.

44:46.160 --> 44:48.160
I did 14.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.560
Wow, that is not good.

44:52.240 --> 44:53.680
You really did them, huh?

44:53.680 --> 44:57.280
But I had it, but my roommate sat on my back while I did it.

44:57.280 --> 45:00.800
The thing is, it doesn't matter how many that you do,

45:01.360 --> 45:04.640
it's the next time you got to do one more.

45:07.200 --> 45:08.880
Big dog, no fear.

45:09.520 --> 45:10.320
1998.

45:10.320 --> 45:11.920
D-D-Deep, no fear.

45:14.880 --> 45:17.200
Never give up, never surrender.

45:18.800 --> 45:21.360
You could fight, you could fly, you could grow.

45:23.360 --> 45:26.000
You got to save Maggie, got to save Jack,

45:26.000 --> 45:27.600
let your roommate sit on your back.

45:28.800 --> 45:30.160
Oh my God.

45:30.160 --> 45:32.080
Bangarang, no fear.

45:32.080 --> 45:33.760
You just got to get out there and bangarang,

45:33.760 --> 45:34.640
you know what I'm saying?

45:34.640 --> 45:36.160
No fear, I have all this,

45:36.160 --> 45:39.040
I'm reading this off my car's rear windshield right now.

45:39.680 --> 45:42.640
I have all this emblazoned there.

45:43.280 --> 45:44.800
I've been in several collisions.

45:46.400 --> 45:48.160
Travis, you could probably do,

45:48.160 --> 45:49.760
were we to actually do pushups,

45:49.760 --> 45:51.040
you could probably do more than us.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.480
That seems fair.

45:52.480 --> 45:53.760
That is probably true.

45:53.760 --> 45:56.080
I have healthy upper body strength.

45:56.080 --> 45:58.000
You use your physical form in the world

45:58.000 --> 45:59.680
in a way that Griffin and I are unaccustomed.

45:59.680 --> 46:01.760
I take a great offense to that

46:01.760 --> 46:04.640
because I have recently been crushing it

46:04.640 --> 46:07.200
with Mr. Bob Harper of The Biggest Loser

46:08.080 --> 46:10.720
and he has been toning and blasting me

46:12.000 --> 46:14.080
in ways that I did not know were possible

46:14.080 --> 46:15.680
for my body to be toned and blasted.

46:17.200 --> 46:19.840
Is the titular it that you're crushing your dignity?

46:19.840 --> 46:21.840
Is that how you say it?

46:21.840 --> 46:22.480
No kidding.

46:22.480 --> 46:24.640
I put the DVD, the workout DVD,

46:24.640 --> 46:26.720
in my computer in my room

46:26.720 --> 46:27.680
so that no one can see.

46:27.680 --> 46:28.720
Because when I work out,

46:28.720 --> 46:31.360
I look like a fucking sea creature.

46:31.360 --> 46:32.880
I look awful.

46:32.880 --> 46:34.960
I am like within three minutes

46:34.960 --> 46:37.120
before the fucking warmup is over,

46:37.120 --> 46:40.240
I am just drenched in sweat.

46:41.040 --> 46:42.480
I can't, I don't own free weights

46:42.480 --> 46:43.920
with which to do the exercises

46:43.920 --> 46:45.680
so I have to use cans of pineapples.

46:48.480 --> 46:49.760
Is that why you keep telling me

46:49.760 --> 46:51.040
you're eating so much pineapple?

46:51.040 --> 46:52.720
One time I tried to do it with yearbooks

46:52.720 --> 46:53.920
but they got too slippery

46:53.920 --> 46:55.520
from the sweat I put on them.

46:58.240 --> 46:59.440
I think the rule of thumb,

46:59.440 --> 47:02.400
the problem is however many you say you can do,

47:02.400 --> 47:04.480
if a person cares enough about it

47:04.480 --> 47:06.160
to ask you how many you can do,

47:06.160 --> 47:07.520
they're gonna say they can do five

47:07.520 --> 47:09.200
more than whatever you just said.

47:09.200 --> 47:11.520
Guys, I live in fear of the night

47:11.520 --> 47:12.480
that I'm at a party

47:12.480 --> 47:13.680
and all the dudes are like,

47:13.680 --> 47:15.760
let's have a push-up competition.

47:15.760 --> 47:18.320
I have defined my entire social life

47:18.320 --> 47:20.240
around congregating with people

47:20.240 --> 47:21.280
who are not gonna put me

47:21.280 --> 47:22.720
in that awful, awful position.

47:26.400 --> 47:27.440
And you ask, you know,

47:27.440 --> 47:28.880
obviously where are the pineapples

47:28.880 --> 47:30.000
if we're gonna do this.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.920
Yeah, if we're gonna do it right.

47:31.920 --> 47:33.280
Where's the cans of dole?

47:33.280 --> 47:34.960
I'm gonna need a pineapple can

47:34.960 --> 47:36.080
and I'm also gonna need

47:36.080 --> 47:37.920
the skinniest person here to sit on my back.

47:41.600 --> 47:44.000
I've been trying to get a little more active

47:44.000 --> 47:46.240
and yesterday I was actually

47:46.240 --> 47:47.760
riding the exercise bike

47:47.760 --> 47:50.400
while I was watching an episode

47:50.400 --> 47:51.520
of Parks and Recreation

47:51.520 --> 47:53.440
and I thought, if I'm not careful,

47:53.440 --> 47:54.880
I'm gonna lose touch with the streets.

47:56.720 --> 47:58.480
This, that's my concern,

47:58.480 --> 48:00.160
is I might not have the urban,

48:00.880 --> 48:02.160
the sort of urban edge

48:02.160 --> 48:03.760
that I once possessed.

48:05.760 --> 48:06.800
I should mention I was also

48:06.800 --> 48:08.800
drinking a glass of Pinot Gris.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.080
And wearing a vest.

48:10.080 --> 48:12.880
I was wearing a vest and nothing else.

48:12.880 --> 48:14.000
And a monocle.

48:14.000 --> 48:14.800
And a monocle.

48:16.000 --> 48:16.960
And reading monocle.

48:16.960 --> 48:19.040
Griffin, you got a yahoo?

48:19.040 --> 48:20.160
I have a few yahoos.

48:20.800 --> 48:22.880
This one was sent in by Galiayali.

48:22.880 --> 48:24.080
Thank you, Gali.

48:25.120 --> 48:27.360
It's by yahooanswersuser,

48:27.360 --> 48:28.240
I'm not even gonna try,

48:28.960 --> 48:32.320
K-X-F-L-E-U-G-H,

48:32.320 --> 48:34.000
which I think is pronounced Kla.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.000
Who asks,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.480
how do I keep my bat left sharp?

48:40.640 --> 48:42.320
How do I come out of the closet

48:42.320 --> 48:43.840
as a Jeopardy fetishist?

48:44.880 --> 48:45.920
Oh no.

48:45.920 --> 48:48.320
I mean, there is nothing sexier to me

48:48.320 --> 48:49.440
than a good looking

48:49.440 --> 48:50.960
female Jeopardy contestant.

48:51.920 --> 48:52.320
Wow.

48:52.960 --> 48:53.760
What?

48:53.760 --> 48:55.280
Maybe that's because of the rarity.

48:58.160 --> 48:59.840
This is the only thing

48:59.840 --> 49:01.440
I can ever think about again

49:01.440 --> 49:02.240
that this exists.

49:04.240 --> 49:04.720
Somewhere,

49:05.360 --> 49:06.480
there's someone going,

49:06.480 --> 49:08.080
what is my boner?

49:08.080 --> 49:10.800
You can do as much for the world

49:10.800 --> 49:12.400
as you want to to improve it,

49:12.400 --> 49:14.400
and this will still be a thing in it.

49:14.400 --> 49:16.800
It doesn't matter.

49:16.800 --> 49:17.360
It's sunk.

49:17.360 --> 49:18.320
The ship has sunk.

49:19.520 --> 49:21.280
We've had questions about

49:23.120 --> 49:25.200
wanting to bone Pokemon

49:25.200 --> 49:28.240
and porn parties with your friends.

49:28.240 --> 49:31.600
This is the most upsetting sexual thing

49:31.600 --> 49:32.640
I've ever heard.

49:33.440 --> 49:35.280
Because you record the episode

49:35.280 --> 49:36.960
and you have no idea.

49:36.960 --> 49:38.160
You're just trying to remember

49:39.840 --> 49:42.000
what famous actress, etc, etc.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.440
And there's some dude at home like,

49:43.440 --> 49:44.800
yeah, answer.

49:44.800 --> 49:46.000
Yeah, ring that buzzer.

49:46.560 --> 49:48.080
You see how she signed her name?

49:48.080 --> 49:49.120
Bet it all.

49:49.120 --> 49:49.840
Let's deal with some

49:49.840 --> 49:51.120
pretty harsh truths right now.

49:51.120 --> 49:53.600
If you think that Ken Jennings

49:53.600 --> 49:55.040
didn't get more trim

49:55.040 --> 49:56.960
than a Persian rug factory,

49:56.960 --> 49:58.880
then you are fooling yourself.

49:58.880 --> 50:00.000
You are telling yourself

50:00.000 --> 50:00.880
goofs and lies.

50:01.440 --> 50:03.040
Yeah, but Griffin, here's the thing.

50:03.040 --> 50:05.520
There's him rolling up to a bar

50:05.520 --> 50:07.120
and all the Jeopardy groupies

50:07.120 --> 50:08.560
like falling all over him.

50:08.560 --> 50:09.680
That's perfectly fine.

50:09.680 --> 50:11.200
That doesn't bother me at all.

50:11.200 --> 50:12.560
But the idea of someone

50:12.560 --> 50:14.240
sitting at home in the dark

50:14.240 --> 50:16.000
in the glow of their TV screen

50:16.720 --> 50:18.720
just like losing it

50:18.720 --> 50:20.640
not because the person is winning

50:20.640 --> 50:21.440
and they want to like

50:21.440 --> 50:23.120
latch onto their coattails

50:23.120 --> 50:24.400
but like just because

50:24.400 --> 50:25.920
the person is on the show.

50:27.520 --> 50:28.320
That's weird.

50:28.320 --> 50:28.880
Situation.

50:29.680 --> 50:31.120
There's an attractive lady

50:31.120 --> 50:33.120
playing Jeopardy against two people

50:33.120 --> 50:34.160
crushing them.

50:34.160 --> 50:35.440
Crushing them.

50:35.440 --> 50:36.960
By the time the final Jeopardy comes

50:36.960 --> 50:38.560
there's no way they can catch up

50:38.560 --> 50:40.080
but she still bets everything

50:40.080 --> 50:40.960
gets the answer right

50:40.960 --> 50:42.800
and writes a little joke down

50:42.800 --> 50:44.160
in the answering field.

50:46.160 --> 50:47.360
Yeah, I'm beating it.

50:47.360 --> 50:48.000
All right.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.840
Dot's the eye with a little heart.

50:49.840 --> 50:51.040
Yeah, and the little heart

50:51.040 --> 50:52.800
has a mustache for...

50:53.360 --> 50:54.000
Well, I guess Trebek

50:54.000 --> 50:54.960
doesn't have that anymore.

50:55.840 --> 50:56.480
No.

50:56.480 --> 50:57.440
And the little heart

50:57.440 --> 50:58.400
doesn't have a mustache.

50:59.280 --> 51:00.080
As she's leaving

51:00.080 --> 51:01.120
she books her flight home

51:01.120 --> 51:02.000
and they say,

51:02.000 --> 51:03.200
wait, you've got to come

51:03.200 --> 51:05.440
back tomorrow and win again.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
She said, I just won Jeopardy.

51:08.000 --> 51:08.720
Yeah.

51:08.720 --> 51:10.160
And then she winks and leaves.

51:10.160 --> 51:11.120
Batten a thousand.

51:11.120 --> 51:12.160
And then she gets...

51:12.160 --> 51:12.960
And then they say,

51:12.960 --> 51:14.640
did anyone catch her name?

51:14.640 --> 51:16.000
No, she was a Jeopardy angel.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
She was Roma Downey.

51:18.000 --> 51:18.800
She's gone now.

51:20.400 --> 51:21.360
Schooled by an angel.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.000
And that was the day

51:24.000 --> 51:25.840
I shaved my mustache.

51:25.840 --> 51:26.560
Alex Trebek.

51:27.600 --> 51:29.600
I'm saying there's a lot of

51:30.480 --> 51:30.880
I'll say

51:32.720 --> 51:33.360
sort of

51:33.360 --> 51:35.440
conspicuous sexual energy

51:35.440 --> 51:36.160
in Jeopardy.

51:37.120 --> 51:38.800
I think it's under the radar.

51:38.800 --> 51:40.800
And it's all generated by Alex Trebek.

51:42.160 --> 51:43.840
Well, and also in every episode

51:43.840 --> 51:46.000
someone talks about Merv Griffith.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.440
If there's ever been a dirtier name

51:47.440 --> 51:48.160
I don't know what it is.

51:48.880 --> 51:50.880
Merv Griffith.

51:50.880 --> 51:51.920
I do love when that show

51:51.920 --> 51:53.120
gets accidentally sexual.

51:53.120 --> 51:53.920
Like when the guy

51:54.480 --> 51:55.680
got the question

51:55.680 --> 51:56.720
about the garden instrument

51:56.720 --> 51:58.640
that also means a person of loose morals

51:58.640 --> 51:59.360
and he said, ho.

51:59.920 --> 52:00.960
And the answer was rake.

52:02.880 --> 52:05.200
There was one where the guy

52:05.200 --> 52:06.720
got asked what a punch

52:06.720 --> 52:08.000
to the back of the head was called

52:08.000 --> 52:09.120
named after an animal.

52:09.120 --> 52:10.320
And he said donkey punch.

52:10.320 --> 52:11.600
But it's really a rabbit punch.

52:14.160 --> 52:15.280
That's brutal.

52:15.280 --> 52:16.640
So you've been working

52:16.640 --> 52:17.280
at what are you writing

52:17.280 --> 52:19.120
a mental floss article about this or what?

52:20.720 --> 52:22.240
So you're pretty well educated.

52:22.240 --> 52:23.440
Well, listen, thank you guys

52:23.440 --> 52:24.560
so much for joining us.

52:24.560 --> 52:26.000

52:41.040 --> 52:42.240

52:42.240 --> 52:44.000

52:46.480 --> 52:47.360
Kalia Buckler.

52:48.160 --> 52:49.520
I think this person's name

52:49.520 --> 52:50.400
is Donger Monkey.

52:52.400 --> 52:53.360
Hallways.

52:53.360 --> 52:55.360

53:12.320 --> 53:14.720

53:15.280 --> 53:16.320

53:18.080 --> 53:22.000

53:22.560 --> 53:24.240
And while you're searching iTunes,

53:24.240 --> 53:25.680
might I recommend checking out

53:25.680 --> 53:27.680

53:28.960 --> 53:30.240

53:31.840 --> 53:32.640
television.

53:32.640 --> 53:33.360

53:33.360 --> 53:35.680
And in case of emergencies on there too,

53:35.680 --> 53:36.720
is Travis show we talked about

53:36.720 --> 53:38.880
how you can survive disaster scenarios.

53:38.880 --> 53:40.480
It's practical, useful advice.

53:41.360 --> 53:43.360
Pretty, pretty different from ours.

53:43.360 --> 53:43.920
Our show.

53:44.640 --> 53:45.760
You can download my EP.

53:49.120 --> 53:50.320
Modern, modern love.

53:50.320 --> 53:51.120
Is that the name of it?

53:51.120 --> 53:52.400
What did you decide on?

53:52.400 --> 53:54.240
It's called Helplessness Blues

53:54.240 --> 53:56.160
because I I am Fleet Foxes.

53:56.880 --> 53:58.480

53:59.120 --> 53:59.840

54:35.040 --> 54:36.800
is starting to open a candy of some sort.

54:36.800 --> 54:38.000
So we should probably wrap up.

54:38.800 --> 54:40.640
It's my Valentine's Day candy.

54:40.640 --> 54:41.600
I'm really excited about it.
