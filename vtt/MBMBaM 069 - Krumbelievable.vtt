WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.600
Live from Seattle, baby, we hear the blues a-callin',

00:48.240 --> 00:53.440
tossed salad and scrambled eggs, all three of us here in beautiful Washington,

00:55.680 --> 00:58.400
tossed salad and scrambled eggs. What the hell are you talking about?

00:58.400 --> 01:03.840
All three of us here for my brother, my brother, and me in sunny Seattle, beautiful weather.

01:03.840 --> 01:06.320
I don't know what people are talking about with the cloudy and the rainy.

01:06.320 --> 01:10.480
I it's been gorgeous. It's just been sunny, funny summer. Yeah,

01:10.480 --> 01:13.520
it is. And all three of us are here gathered around one microphone.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.440
I'm Justin McElroy live from Seattle. I'm your oldest brother.

01:18.160 --> 01:21.760
I'm Griffin McElroy. I'm just kicking it in Seattle just with my two brothers.

01:21.760 --> 01:29.280
Best people around. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm live from Seattle. Now, Travis,

01:30.160 --> 01:34.320
if you are live from Seattle, I do not currently see you. Yeah, what's going on?

01:34.320 --> 01:38.160
I'm in the other room. I'm not with you guys. I'm here for a different event.

01:39.200 --> 01:45.440
Okay, you're staying in a much nicer hotel. Yeah, I'm here for the former Saturday Night

01:45.440 --> 01:51.520
Live lookalike convention. That's very good. Say hi to Reggie for me.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.040
I was just like Charles Rocket.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.800
I don't know that there is a nicer hotel in the hotel that we're staying at because

01:58.800 --> 02:03.280
we have the four regular pillows on our bed, you know, stacked too deep, too wide.

02:03.280 --> 02:08.160
But then we have another too fast, too furious. We have another pillow that is sort of a sliver

02:08.160 --> 02:13.360
of a pillow, just sort of like a suggestion of a pillow. And I'm not a pillow for the pillows.

02:13.360 --> 02:17.600
I think it might be like it might be like a little baby pillow. So the other pillows feel

02:17.600 --> 02:20.560
like they've accomplished something in their life. But I don't I don't know what to do with

02:20.560 --> 02:24.960
it in my body. Like, do I tuck it between my legs because it's even too tiny for that.

02:24.960 --> 02:29.520
It's hard to say. Does your hotel does your hotel have a pillow menu?

02:30.240 --> 02:35.920
No, no, no pillow menu. This is, of course, an advice show for the modern era where we take

02:35.920 --> 02:40.560
your questions and we turn them alchemy like into wisdom. Let's get away before we start.

02:41.200 --> 02:46.720
Justin. Yeah, I put up that cursive thing and I need you to apologize to me.

02:46.720 --> 02:51.920
OK, I will I will admit you're a good cursive. I don't think that is how that is, though.

02:51.920 --> 02:57.520
I don't think that is how it is. I do it with a flamboyant flair. But that is how the easy

02:57.520 --> 03:03.120
you look like. You look like a meth addicted hooker's mouth. It looked like a C with a bouffant.

03:03.120 --> 03:09.120
But it is correct. That is that is maybe not so over the top. But yeah. Yeah. You're not

03:09.120 --> 03:13.440
all winners. Yeah. Written language over the top. Yeah. It's kind of your whole style.

03:13.440 --> 03:17.120
Well, you like to zazz your pizzazzle with all your writing.

03:17.840 --> 03:24.960
Probably. So let's get right into it. I was having lunch with three people I respect and admire.

03:24.960 --> 03:28.560
They all start criticizing a close friend of mine, not knowing she is my friend.

03:28.560 --> 03:34.480
The criticism is distasteful and unjustified. What should I do in this situation? Should I

03:34.480 --> 03:39.360
keep my mouth shut and move on or defend my friend and lose respect from my other friends?

03:39.360 --> 03:43.680
That's from Jake. You think this is a veiled way of saying that we insulted his friends?

03:44.320 --> 03:47.600
He doesn't know if he should stop listening to our podcast. Because if that's the case,

03:47.600 --> 03:52.320
like I'm not I don't apologize for anything. Oh, wow. I mean, what I say, I say what I mean,

03:52.320 --> 03:57.360
take no prisoners. It says shit. And he means it all 100% of the time. Wait, did you say the

03:57.360 --> 04:02.400
elephant session? It means that 100% or did you say all of that? Are you referencing Timothy?

04:02.400 --> 04:06.640
All of Timothy all of that says what he means. It means what he says. Stop his cowboy hat to you.

04:06.640 --> 04:12.880
It says good day. Timothy Olyphant is faithful 100%. He's got your back.

04:16.400 --> 04:20.320
Just a real quick shout out to Timothy Olyphant. Thanks for everything, big guy.

04:21.520 --> 04:28.800
I think that you should it is actually a very admirable quality, I think to defend

04:28.800 --> 04:34.960
anybody who's being attacked and isn't present. And it's it's something that I think we all fall

04:34.960 --> 04:43.360
down on. But yeah, it's certainly the the I know I do, but it's certainly the the the right thing

04:43.360 --> 04:47.280
to do or the respectful thing to do to try to defend people or at least not attack people who

04:47.280 --> 04:55.600
aren't at a place. Although I would say from personal experience, if the person doing the

04:55.600 --> 05:02.480
like the backstabbing is is drunk. It's it's best to just let that one go by. Because I got into a

05:02.480 --> 05:06.800
screaming match with a girl on her birthday once for defending another one of my friends. And

05:07.520 --> 05:12.240
it was it was it was a bad scene. It was a real bad scene. I'm not sure that it's the right.

05:12.240 --> 05:16.080
It might be the right thing to do, but I don't know that it's the pragmatic thing to do. Like,

05:17.840 --> 05:22.800
I didn't have I haven't had so many friends lately. And I think it's because I keep getting

05:22.800 --> 05:28.640
in this situation and I trade in the three friends for one friend. And then it's like,

05:28.640 --> 05:33.520
I'm down two friends. Mathematically speaking, I don't have the two friends I would have had if I

05:33.520 --> 05:37.440
had stuck with the three instead of the one. You know, you got to keep in mind how many friends

05:37.440 --> 05:43.600
can I keep in my life at all times and have the maximum number of friends. I think I think what

05:43.600 --> 05:51.440
you need to do is you have to sit back and say, is this one friend worth these three friends?

05:51.440 --> 05:56.480
And it sounds like if they're being distasteful and unjustified, like they don't really sound

05:56.480 --> 06:00.960
like great people. But you're not thinking of it pragmatically. It's all about pragmatism.

06:00.960 --> 06:07.920
This episode, you guys, because that's three warm bodies, three for maybe maybe their one friend

06:07.920 --> 06:16.000
is gigantic. Oh, and that's why the three friends were picking on like a situation. Yeah, I am.

06:16.640 --> 06:23.440
I think that it's a fine opportunity to practice decency, which you should try to defend people,

06:23.440 --> 06:29.200
even if they're not your friends. So don't make that like, I don't know. Don't make that a huge

06:29.200 --> 06:33.120
part of your decision making process. But what if it's Osama bin Laden? You still want him to

06:33.120 --> 06:42.080
defend Osama bin Laden? I think friendship is sacred. With terrorist leaders? I don't think

06:42.080 --> 06:46.720
that they're friends. What are they going to say about Osama? His ass is dead. Yeah. What are they

06:46.720 --> 06:50.960
going to say about Osama bin Laden that is distasteful and unjust? That hasn't already been

06:50.960 --> 06:59.920
said in an infinite number of Toby Keith songs. I think that the answer is yes, but to not get

06:59.920 --> 07:05.680
belligerent about it. There's a polite way to defend people without turning it into an us

07:05.680 --> 07:10.560
versus them type situation. And usually if you say something like, well, actually, you know,

07:10.560 --> 07:15.440
I'm pretty good friends with them and they're all right. Everybody around you will get the hint and

07:15.440 --> 07:20.960
not keep talking shit. If they do, it's turning into a whole different situation. Yeah. You know

07:20.960 --> 07:25.440
what I mean? Like then you just need to get out of there, maybe smack a few faces on your way out

07:25.440 --> 07:31.760
the door. Yeah. As you run with your hand out into the smacking position. Or it's also would be

07:31.760 --> 07:36.320
great if you didn't say anything and then later somehow made sure they found out that you're

07:36.320 --> 07:40.640
friends with this person because then they retroactively feel guilty and that goes down.

07:40.640 --> 07:52.240
What's up? The twist dating. Why? You didn't see this coming. Hey, is it? Is it possible to get my

07:52.240 --> 07:58.400
hopes up for a first date without ruining things? Is there a happy medium between two high expectations

07:58.400 --> 08:03.360
and pressure and being hopeful and excited about the possibilities of that relationship? That's from

08:03.360 --> 08:11.520
form spring. Oh, God. What do you mean by ruin things? Like are you? I peed myself. Yeah. Yeah.

08:11.520 --> 08:16.400
Like are you rolling up and being like, marry me? Oh, damn it. Ah, fuck. You look great. I peed my

08:18.160 --> 08:28.800
I put pee in my pants because you're so beautiful. Um, um, no, no. You have to go in jaded. Totally.

08:28.800 --> 08:35.840
No, not that. Just totally cash talking about cashmere baby. Cause you don't want to freak her

08:35.840 --> 08:39.760
out. You don't want to freak yourself out. The best way to get to know somebody is in a no,

08:40.320 --> 08:46.000
a low to no pressure situation. And you can't craft that for yourself. You go in thinking

08:46.000 --> 08:50.800
things about wedding bells. I actually babies and wedding bells. I completely agree. Griffin.

08:50.800 --> 08:57.040
I think that first dates in and of themselves are like booby traps that are set up to make you fail.

08:57.040 --> 09:05.520
Yeah. Literally. Yeah. Good one. But I think that I said some dismissiveness there.

09:06.640 --> 09:12.640
I think that it is a built in high pressure situation. You know, like everything about it is,

09:13.600 --> 09:18.560
is like built to be awkward. And if you bring your high pressure situation into her low pressure

09:18.560 --> 09:23.920
situation, you get a tornado and thousands die. Very sensitive Griffin. Think about it.

09:23.920 --> 09:30.080
What is it? People are friends on the East coast. Travis right now is batting down the hatches.

09:30.640 --> 09:36.640
I'm, I'm in the midst of, of the storm. That's why I said tornado and not hurricane. Thanks guys.

09:36.640 --> 09:40.880
But it's pretty much all the same thing. They made weather like there's bad weather everywhere.

09:40.880 --> 09:46.000
I can't talk about bad weather. Hurricane made the made tornadoes. That's the fucking scariest

09:46.000 --> 09:50.960
thing I've ever heard. Baby, baby tornadoes. It's spun off the hurricane the day after tomorrow.

09:50.960 --> 09:58.080
Oh, like it all happens at once. Earthquakes. Yeah. Hey, and then the earth core starts,

09:58.080 --> 10:06.400
stop spinning. Speaking of this hurricane, I hope everyone is, um, is safe and is, it is,

10:06.400 --> 10:10.800
I guess by Monday, this will all sort of blown over for, for our us friends. Maybe not some of

10:10.800 --> 10:17.200
our friends in Canada. Um, but I hope you were fine. It sounds like the, the death toll is

10:17.200 --> 10:23.920
relatively low. I didn't want to mention one that I saw. One of the very few deaths, um, was listed

10:23.920 --> 10:28.240
in the news as a, and I don't want to be disrespectful here, was listed in the news as a,

10:28.240 --> 10:37.200
um, a 55 year old surfer that died. And to me, it just screamed like, that's a full on,

10:38.240 --> 10:45.200
that's a full on Bodie situation. That guy can't live in a cage, the cage of, of going into that

10:45.200 --> 10:51.760
dark twilight. And he just, I have to imagine that that is like lifeguard lingo. Like there's a dude,

10:51.760 --> 10:55.520
there's a lifeguard on the beach radioing other lifeguards saying, Oh, I'm going to need some

10:55.520 --> 11:00.880
support out here. We got a full on Bodie. We got a full on Bodie. Like this, like the chopper,

11:00.880 --> 11:06.560
they wouldn't list him as a 55 year old surfer unless he was fucking carving the waves right then.

11:06.560 --> 11:10.240
I actually, I read it his little bit in the New York Times. Cause I got, I got news where you're

11:10.240 --> 11:15.200
55 year old. You're not a pro. It's not your career. I read it a little bit in the New York Times.

11:15.200 --> 11:19.760
They actually said, um, 55 year old radical surfer. So I think that they added that extra

11:19.760 --> 11:22.960
thing to let you know. What is it? Do I have something on my teeth? I was trying not to

11:22.960 --> 11:28.000
distract, but no, no. Which one is it? Oh, let me see. Smile. No, the other one. This guy? Yeah.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.680
One of your canines. Okay. Yeah, you got it. Great. Um, don't surf in hurricane. Can we give

11:35.680 --> 11:42.240
out general advice for surviving disasters like this? General hurricane advice. Um,

11:42.240 --> 11:48.880
there's no laws anymore. No, everything's fucking on the table. Grab, snatch and grab. Snatch and

11:48.880 --> 11:55.680
grab. It's all yours. I've also learned from so many, um, like weather horror movies. Don't wear

11:55.680 --> 12:00.960
a Hawaiian shirt and put down your video camera. Oh my God. You'll be sucked into the vacuum.

12:00.960 --> 12:07.280
Those two things will kill you. Also, this is a great time to listen to Jimmy Buffett back catalog.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.800
Yeah. Because if you don't now you'll die and then you'll never have heard it.

12:11.760 --> 12:16.000
The, uh, the, uh, and he's got lots of songs about surviving this sort of thing and that's a pretty

12:16.000 --> 12:24.720
good attitude throughout. Um, you, uh, you should remember, uh, above all that, um, hold on. Shit.

12:24.720 --> 12:30.240
I forgot my thing. Hold on. Love conquers all. No, not love conquers all. True love waits. True love

12:30.240 --> 12:37.600
waits. So don't get hurricane nasty. I know hurricane nasty is sweeping the Gulf coast.

12:37.600 --> 12:42.160
This is my windiest nap. It's dirty with four R's. It's quite a storm.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.160
Oh, is there a good hurricane pickup line?

12:48.080 --> 12:55.600
Um, I want to batten down your hatches. I mean, yeah, but I guess I want to, I don't want to turn

12:55.600 --> 13:02.720
this into, I don't want to turn this into a high pressure system. We better, we better go to the

13:02.720 --> 13:10.080
grocery store and before it gets raided and buy condoms to have sex with. Okay. A little on the

13:10.080 --> 13:18.640
nose, baby. I think, um, or we could just raw dog it. Hey, there's a hurricane coming. We should

13:18.640 --> 13:26.400
probably bone. Have you ever made sex in a swirling vortex? Maybe that could be now.

13:26.400 --> 13:29.600
Wouldn't that be the tree? Like I don't want to get weird, but wouldn't that be the dream?

13:30.240 --> 13:33.680
If you were sucked into a swirling vortex, like made coitus, like, whoa,

13:35.600 --> 13:40.320
this is the most intense experience of my life. Check it out. Poseidon.

13:40.320 --> 13:46.720
Hmm. Thunk. That was me. I was getting enslaved to the cyber building. I mean,

13:46.720 --> 13:53.600
killed in. Cow. Couple having just totally righteous. Another couple having totally

13:53.600 --> 14:00.880
righteous sky sex. Get a net, Bill Pullen. We got to save them. What about that 55 year old

14:00.880 --> 14:06.160
pro surfer? It's too late for him. Too late for him. He's surfing, surfing the sky. Maybe the 55

14:06.160 --> 14:11.280
year old surfer was trying to save a sky sex couple. And that's what, like, I've got to carve

14:11.280 --> 14:17.520
into the storm and save them or get a better look at least. I'm 55. I got nothing. How hard do you

14:17.520 --> 14:22.320
think miserly was playing in that dude's head as he surfed a hurricane? What a cool way to go out.

14:22.320 --> 14:26.000
That's what he was thinking. He didn't think he was going to like wake up the next day. A 75 foot

14:26.000 --> 14:34.160
wave tower door is like worth a done. Uh, how about a Yahoo answer for us? Justin, don't,

14:34.160 --> 14:37.760
Justin's like looking at my computer right now. I don't want him to. Oh, I won't look. I don't want

14:37.760 --> 14:42.800
him to look. Um, okay, here it is. Yeah. Don't look at the question because this is, this one's

14:42.800 --> 14:47.280
pretty important for you not to look at. Okay. This was sent in by Daisy Gray. Thank you, Daisy.

14:47.280 --> 14:53.040
It's about Yahoo answers user rashie who asks, is it bad to run to girlfriend in the rain like in

14:53.040 --> 14:59.360
the movies? Okay. I just left my girlfriend's apartment seeing her and my daughter. Well,

14:59.360 --> 15:04.080
tomorrow morning I'm going off to college for basketball only about 40 minutes away, but still,

15:04.080 --> 15:08.640
and I want to surprise her one last time. I want to run to her in the rain like in them

15:08.640 --> 15:15.040
corny movies. She loves that stuff. I already got Skittles her favorite candy and it's pouring rain.

15:15.040 --> 15:23.920
Should I do it? Would that be stupid? Wait, hold on. Hey buddy. Have you guys seen the notebook?

15:23.920 --> 15:34.960
I love that scene where, um, that, that one guy, who's that one guy, Ryan, Ryan, Philippine, Ryan

15:34.960 --> 15:40.240
Reynolds, Ryan Gosling, man, there's a lot of sexy ass Ryans out there. They're doing good. Uh,

15:40.240 --> 15:44.960
Ryan Gosling runs up to that other chick is like, Hey, even before he gets to her,

15:44.960 --> 15:49.120
he just throws a pile of Skittles in her face. Just like throws a handful. Like if you're a bird,

15:49.120 --> 15:54.960
I'm a bird Skittles. Take them. Whoa. Did you just, uh, did you just quote the notebook?

15:54.960 --> 16:02.800
Is that, was that a notebook selection? You know, the tricky thing about running in the rain is

16:02.800 --> 16:09.360
where do I park my car? Where's far enough? How far away is far enough, but not too far.

16:09.920 --> 16:13.040
And by the time you get there, you're just like tired. You're like, you're like,

16:13.040 --> 16:21.920
Oh, hi. I puke, puke up all the Skittles you ate on the way over. I need your Skittles. I needed

16:21.920 --> 16:29.440
the carbs. I'll be like, you get there to her and you, you put your hand in your pocket and you

16:29.440 --> 16:33.280
pull out crazy core Skittles. And you're like, I'm sorry. All they had was crazy core. And she's

16:33.280 --> 16:40.320
like, I don't care. I love the idea of like completely contextless running to someone in

16:40.320 --> 16:44.960
the rain. Like you run up to them and then what? Like you run up and you're like, Hey,

16:45.680 --> 16:52.640
you're talking about a stranger. No, but like he's leaving for college later. And so like,

16:52.640 --> 16:58.560
he's like, I want to run up to her and say what? Like, make sure that you're there when I leave

16:58.560 --> 17:03.120
tomorrow. So wait a minute. Did he say his girlfriend and his daughter and he's going

17:03.120 --> 17:08.640
to college, play basketball? Yeah. Hey, if you want a grand romantic gesture, take your daughter

17:08.640 --> 17:16.000
with you. Take your daughter to college here. Maybe like getting a part with the both of them

17:16.000 --> 17:21.200
and don't be a Debbie absent father. If you want like grand gestures, that'd be a good start.

17:21.760 --> 17:24.800
Oh, maybe the Skittles are for the daughter to like ease the pain.

17:28.880 --> 17:33.760
He doesn't say he's going to college to play basketball. He's going to college for basketball.

17:33.760 --> 17:37.760
Oh, you think he's going to like Duke and he's like, I just love them blue devils so much.

17:37.760 --> 17:44.720
I actually think he's going to study basketball. Like a basketball doctor. Yeah. I'm Dr. Basketball

17:44.720 --> 17:51.440
Jones. Step into my office. Your hoops are all wrong. Let me show you about free throws.

17:52.560 --> 18:01.040
I wrote my thesis on two points. My prescription sick dunks. I see your problem here. You seem to

18:01.040 --> 18:09.440
affect the funk on a nasty though. I'm running out of things. I know about basketball. Charlotte

18:09.440 --> 18:15.520
Hornets aren't a team. Have you met Dr. Jones? He's he's an odd duck. He wears Reebok pumps

18:15.520 --> 18:24.160
with his tweed. I like those are still thing. Yeah. Pumps are Reebok still a thing. Reebok.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.600
I think my is still around. That's a company anymore. You know, you just snatched them up.

18:27.600 --> 18:31.760
You know, that in these songs is so popular right now. Are they saying all the kids with

18:31.760 --> 18:35.840
the pumped up kicks? Is that about Reebok pump? I'm pretty sure the song you're talking about

18:35.840 --> 18:40.400
is written by all American rejects. Thus cannot be qualified. I don't think it's written by,

18:40.400 --> 18:45.440
I think it's written by the, the, the sick meanies or something. Some sort of righteous any name.

18:46.320 --> 18:51.200
What did you just say? The Richard Grieco's. There it is. The Sky Surfers. Oh, the Sky

18:51.200 --> 18:56.240
Surfers. Yeah. Uh, no, we're not the Richard Grieco's anymore. We lost our base. Now we're

18:56.240 --> 19:04.560
just Grieco. Ah, Richard Grieco. The Richard Grieco experience. Hey, this Monday, my wife and

19:04.560 --> 19:09.920
I will find out if we are indeed going to be parents. We're excited at the possibility and

19:09.920 --> 19:16.400
have started trying to plan ahead things to get one area. We're stuck in as a baby themed room.

19:16.400 --> 19:23.120
We wanted something different from the normal animal themed room. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Animal

19:23.120 --> 19:29.040
themed room or a single with eminol and felt that the wise brothers three would provide us

19:29.040 --> 19:37.200
with some great thoughts. That's from confounded in K C I'm going to throw out and this is kind of

19:37.200 --> 19:44.720
meta, but what about a baby themed baby themed room? Oh man. And you just paint babies all over

19:44.720 --> 19:50.080
the walls. Yeah. And like with signs like you are this, like I love that. I think that's important

19:50.080 --> 19:54.800
for human beings to know what and who they are pretty much instantly so they can start growing

19:54.800 --> 20:00.080
and learning from it. Like I think you learn from yourself. Maybe, maybe instead of a baby,

20:00.080 --> 20:07.440
it's like a zygote or like a fetus and you're like, you were this now get better. Oh, I like

20:07.440 --> 20:14.400
that. What if you put, what if you took it as an educational thing and you put just a ton of objects

20:14.400 --> 20:21.440
in the room that would say maybe like out loud, perhaps with one of the greeting card sound chips,

20:21.440 --> 20:25.840
they would say out loud what they are, but they would all do it at the same time and they would

20:25.840 --> 20:32.400
do it 24 hours a day. Chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair,

20:32.400 --> 20:41.600
chair, bad, bad, bad drums, hidden pot, pump shoes, pump shoes. Why did you hide your pot

20:41.600 --> 20:48.000
in the baby's room, dad? You had to touch one of them that just said baby, baby, baby and just be

20:48.000 --> 20:59.760
Justin Bieber. Oh, that would be, that would make for probably a unibomber. How was my babyhood?

20:59.760 --> 21:03.520
I will tell you. Not great because I'm looking at that lamp and it's screaming in my brain. So

21:04.320 --> 21:08.000
it could be better. All I could think of when I blew out the building was well,

21:08.000 --> 21:13.040
that's one building of things that won't be screaming at babies today. Building, building,

21:13.040 --> 21:18.240
building, building, building, building, windows, windows. I have to kill the building,

21:19.440 --> 21:25.760
but now it's screaming pit, empty pit, empty pit, empty pit. It's just like my heart, heart, heart,

21:25.760 --> 21:33.840
heart. What about a Steve Guttenberg themed room? Gutten baby. Yeah, that would be, or just let's

21:33.840 --> 21:42.000
go full whole hog and we'll go three and a half minute a baby and three and three quarters men

21:42.000 --> 21:48.640
and also a baby. Who's the three quarters man? The goods. All right. I'm pretty sure he was

21:48.640 --> 21:53.760
listed in one of the original men, right? And it was Steve Guttenberg, Steve Danson, Steve, Steve

21:53.760 --> 22:03.120
Danson and Paul Rudd in his, in his acting debut as the baby. He was awesome as the baby. There

22:03.120 --> 22:08.640
were fucking, there were three dads in that shit, right? Yeah. Yeah. Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg,

22:09.760 --> 22:15.760
Paul Rudd and Paul Reiser. Paul Reiser, Peter Sarsgaard and Stellan Scarsgaard.

22:17.120 --> 22:21.680
Hey guys, can we get together and fucking pick one? Yeah, just pick a thing. Just pick a,

22:21.680 --> 22:27.040
you can't throw K's in there. It's, it's one name or the other. Um, what about a Scarsgaard

22:27.040 --> 22:31.760
themed room? Oh, you've got a baby. You got a baby in the room. Did you, did you Scarsgaard

22:31.760 --> 22:38.400
everything? Which is the Scarsgaard in the true blood? Is that Stellan? Stellar, Stellam Scarsgaards.

22:38.400 --> 22:43.360
Stellam Scarsgaards needs to stop taking pictures on magazines with like him pulling the front of

22:43.360 --> 22:48.080
his pants down. Like, Hey, maybe we'll see some pubes. Like I don't want, actually I'm checking

22:48.080 --> 22:53.520
out at H-E-B and I'm buying like bacon and dates. Like I don't want to see your almost pubes, Sarah.

22:53.520 --> 22:57.840
And I certainly don't want my baby to see them. Bad idea. I vote down. Your idea. Okay. Yeah.

22:57.840 --> 23:03.120
V-TED. V-TED. What about, um, cause now that I'm thinking about Gutenberg, I'm just thinking about

23:03.120 --> 23:08.240
short circuit. What about just like an all short circuit themed room? Right. What if we went over

23:08.240 --> 23:12.960
the top and said just a robotic room? See, this is something I could get behind. Cause that's. I like it.

23:14.000 --> 23:20.640
That's, robots had such a big influence on me and my life. Um, uh, uh, vis-a-vis short circuit

23:20.640 --> 23:27.040
and, uh, iron giant. Um, robots are important. And I think you need to, I think, I think the next

23:27.040 --> 23:32.160
generation of children is going to have a very good reason to be scared of robots. Right. So if

23:32.160 --> 23:36.240
your baby's half robot or at least can sympathize with them or communicate with them, it'll help.

23:36.240 --> 23:41.200
Yeah. Uh, I don't want, yeah. You don't, you don't want your baby to be a robo-phobe. You got to get

23:41.200 --> 23:46.000
them in early. You got to get them in deep. Can you, if you make a baby themed, uh, like a baby,

23:46.000 --> 23:50.320
a robot themed baby room, can you make an exoskeleton for your baby? Because I think that

23:50.320 --> 23:57.280
would like an animate. Okay. We've seen in a lot of science fiction exoskeletons used to give, um,

23:58.800 --> 24:02.560
disabled people, the ability to, uh, or people with disabilities,

24:02.560 --> 24:07.600
the ability to walk. I'm saying, could that technology apply to babies?

24:07.600 --> 24:10.160
Is this example based purely out of Robocop?

24:11.280 --> 24:15.760
See, he, you're saying Robocop. I'm saying it's more of like a Power Rangers Megazord

24:15.760 --> 24:21.360
situation. Gundam, maybe an Evangelion. Yeah. What if you raised your baby and convinced him

24:21.360 --> 24:28.400
he was a robot like that, like an AI situation and you convinced him that he was a baby robot

24:28.400 --> 24:33.760
like, Oh no, when you die, you're not going to go, you're not going to heaven. So

24:35.920 --> 24:39.680
I have seen bicentennial man. You are going in the garbage.

24:39.680 --> 24:44.560
I don't think that's what happens in bicentennial man. Yeah. Yeah. Williams dies. The last shot is

24:44.560 --> 24:50.800
him in the garbage. God. It's the only travesty is that robot Robin Williams can be found in the

24:50.800 --> 24:58.560
garbage. Robin Williams can't legally be thrown on the scrap heap of Hollywood. That's the best we

24:58.560 --> 25:08.000
got. RV is the scrap heap of Hollywood. Hey Robin, stop it. I hate that guy.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.720
Does anybody ever just refer to him by just his first name? That was just so strange to me when

25:12.720 --> 25:19.280
you said that. You have to call him Robin Williams. I call him Rob, just because we so tight.

25:19.840 --> 25:27.680
Bob Williams. Um, and sometimes I call him, uh, uh, the most hair suit man in the world. Yeah.

25:27.680 --> 25:33.840
But it's a little long form. Or Mork. Mork. He loves that. He loves that. He loves that stuff.

25:33.840 --> 25:39.600
He loves that. He loves that stuff. Hey Mork. Oh, that's a good one. Justin.

25:40.800 --> 25:46.560
Was that your, was that your, sorry. Was that your Robin Williams man? I only got like one voice.

25:47.360 --> 25:55.040
Yeah. Hey, I start all right. Impression. Yeah. You got a Paul Rudd. Yeah. Oh, that's a good one.

25:55.040 --> 26:05.200
Justin. Hey, I started a new job in April supervising employees who have been working

26:05.200 --> 26:11.280
longer than I've been alive. I'm well qualified, but I also happen to be a young, somewhat petite

26:11.280 --> 26:16.800
blonde female. How do I present myself in a way that lets people know that they can't take advantage

26:16.800 --> 26:25.040
of me? Gmail. Robot exoskeleton. Exoskeleton. Exoskeleton is the, obviously the, it's the

26:25.040 --> 26:32.160
obvious answer, but I assume she would have thought of that already. Right? Um, you know,

26:32.160 --> 26:38.720
I think if you, if you go in with that attitude, um, then it's going to create a real contentious

26:38.720 --> 26:44.640
workplace, um, situation. I, I, I'm of the opinion that the best way to supervise people

26:44.640 --> 26:51.440
is to be as, uh, Dale Carnegie said, lavish in your approbation and hardy in your praise.

26:51.440 --> 26:57.440
Are you kidding me? No. With this Carnegie cast. No. What does that mean? You keep turning us into

26:57.440 --> 27:01.680
a Carnegie cast. I, I'm just telling people that that book turned my life around. Just don't

27:01.680 --> 27:08.320
approbate anybody. You know, like that word. You know, lavish with your approbation. Yeah. Don't,

27:08.320 --> 27:13.440
don't drown these fools in approbation. Don't be mad because I've won friends and influenced people.

27:13.440 --> 27:18.880
Don't hate. Don't hate. Celebrate. Define approbate for me right now. And I swear to God, I will give

27:18.880 --> 27:24.160
you $5 out of it. The word was approbation. What does it mean? It means praise. Does it mean it? It

27:24.160 --> 27:31.040
means approving of people. Like approbation? Yeah, like approbation. Fuck that. No. Yep. Why doesn't

27:31.040 --> 27:36.160
Dale Carnegie just say like, Hey, tell him good job and pat him on the back. Tell him good job. Pat

27:36.160 --> 27:39.680
on the back. Good job. Cause he was at the lot. Cause he's dead. He can't say anything anymore.

27:39.680 --> 27:48.480
Wow. Way to really bring it down. He died surfing in the hurricane. Yeah. You win. Okay. I was right.

27:48.480 --> 27:54.400
Yeah. Um, the, uh, yeah, I just think that if you go and say like, you guys aren't going to take

27:54.400 --> 27:59.040
advantage of me, then it's going to create a bad work environment. It's not going to be the kind of

27:59.040 --> 28:04.480
work environment. I would be more concerned with like setting a good role model and leading them

28:04.480 --> 28:09.920
rather than worrying about people taking manage you. Cause I like that they're going to like ask

28:09.920 --> 28:14.400
off extra days work, take advantage of you. Like they're all going to slack off and not do their

28:14.400 --> 28:20.080
job. Like what does it mean? Take advantage of, I'm, I'm confused by the parameters. Well, she

28:20.080 --> 28:25.280
can't answer your question because she's not on this call. Words on a screen. I understand. I

28:25.280 --> 28:30.480
understand the concept. I know how that works. I'm wanting you guys to tell me what you think it is.

28:30.480 --> 28:34.640
Yeah. I like that kind of stuff. Like just not showing up for work and then being like, what fire

28:34.640 --> 28:39.440
me? You can't, I've been doing this longer than you've been alive. Or steal, like stealing rubber

28:39.440 --> 28:43.600
bands, stealing all the rubber bands. What are you doing with those rubber bands? Ah, they're all

28:43.600 --> 28:50.480
mine. Ha ha. I'm making a child. Rubber baby. Rubber baby man. Just love that song so much. Gotta

28:50.480 --> 28:55.200
make a human. So it's like maybe taking advantage of leaving rubber baby in her chair without

28:55.200 --> 29:00.800
warning her. Oops. And with a sign that says we wish rubber baby was our boss. Yeah. Rubber baby

29:00.800 --> 29:08.080
would do better than you. Have you? You shouldn't be my manager, rubber baby. He's very, he's bouncy.

29:08.800 --> 29:15.360
He, um, he smells like an old newspaper. He's very quiet, but he's very resilient. And you can play

29:15.360 --> 29:21.120
hoops with him. Like with him. Like with him. Like you're on him to him. You can play basketball to

29:21.120 --> 29:31.280
him. The one baby it's okay to drop. Um, I, I think that I, I understand your worry, but, but I think

29:31.280 --> 29:34.880
if you work, focus on having a good relationship with these people, that's going to be your best

29:34.880 --> 29:38.480
bet. Cause especially for people who've been doing this for so long, you're not going to whip them

29:38.480 --> 29:43.040
into shape. Like you're not going to whip them into submission. Um, and, and I, I don't think

29:43.040 --> 29:51.040
you should look at, uh, working with them or, or trying to, um, appease them as, as, um,

29:51.040 --> 29:57.760
as a, as a loss. I think it was just plain good, good leadership. I agree. You should have an

29:57.760 --> 30:02.800
unsheathed samurai sword open on your desk. That is absolutely right. That when someone comes in

30:02.800 --> 30:08.160
to ask you a question, no matter how benign the question is, just slowly stroke the hand. Yeah.

30:08.160 --> 30:15.520
Just stroke that wazai kihi and just let her know what's up. Um, if this were like, oh, sorry,

30:15.520 --> 30:18.960
Travis, go right ahead. I was just going to say, I think a good rule of thumb for pretty much

30:18.960 --> 30:23.920
every situation like this is if you respect yourself, if you have confidence in yourself,

30:24.880 --> 30:29.360
then that will carry over to them. If you go in afraid that they're going to take advantage of

30:29.360 --> 30:34.240
you, if you go in feeling underqualified because you're younger than them, that's going to be the

30:34.240 --> 30:39.840
image you project. But if you go in saying I deserve to be here, I deserve to be the supervisor,

30:39.840 --> 30:45.440
they will, uh, they will respect that. If this were a Reese Witherspoon movie,

30:45.440 --> 30:51.520
Mm-hmm. She would have her gay best friend who doesn't work there come into the place and do

30:51.520 --> 30:56.480
something wrong and then she would fire him in front of everyone. What do you guys do like that?

30:56.480 --> 31:00.560
Oh, and he would like cry? Like? Yeah, like, how could she be so mean? I have a sick kid!

31:00.560 --> 31:05.040
I got a sick baby! I don't understand why the friend has to be gay. I just thought that she,

31:05.040 --> 31:08.800
well, like later she's, he's going to help her out with like her relationship. Is this Timothy

31:08.800 --> 31:13.280
Oliphant? Can I imagine? Yeah. If you, actually, if you imagine Timothy Oliphant as a gay man,

31:13.280 --> 31:21.760
you have to go to jail. The man only wears cowboy hats. He wears cowboy hats in the shower. Like,

31:21.760 --> 31:25.280
yeah. And if you picture Timothy Oliphant in the shower in a cowboy hat, you have to go to jail.

31:25.280 --> 31:30.240
Those are, we have an Oliphant laws. Uh, I don't want to go to jail.

31:33.920 --> 31:39.680
Oh, I'm almost sure Isaac Asimov wrote the Oliphant laws. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Um,

31:39.680 --> 31:49.280
a law one cowboy hat. Law two, draw. Um, how about a Yahoo answer question? Please. This one was sent

31:49.280 --> 31:53.760
in by Daniel McKinney. I'm almost certain Justin just looked at it. It's by Yahoo answers user

31:53.760 --> 31:57.760
Garland Garcia, who asks, is it legal to have sex with trees on your own property?

31:59.360 --> 32:06.000
Oh, oh my. Now the top answer is unless the tree can be seen by a passerby, it's not illegal.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.480
It's not as if there's a precedent to making it illegal. Despite the foolishness of the question,

32:10.480 --> 32:15.040
I've decided to address it seriously. And I, I appreciate that. John Lennon,

32:16.560 --> 32:22.000
just your username. Yeah. I don't think that that's accurate. No, yeah, sure. If you have a higher,

32:22.000 --> 32:26.640
here's, what's terrifying about this question and why I decided to discuss it. No, by accurate,

32:26.640 --> 32:30.640
do you think I meant the answer or the fact that that is John Lennon or the fact that there's no

32:30.640 --> 32:34.400
precedent for this? I know. I agree with that part. I don't agree with the fact that it's

32:34.400 --> 32:39.280
John Lennon. He's a ghost in the machine, but he's trapped in Yahoo answers forever. And he just

32:39.280 --> 32:44.240
wants out so bad. Please let him on another site. He can't find his way out because it's a labyrinth.

32:44.240 --> 32:48.480
Yeah. Take it from me. Our show is really about trying to find John Lennon's ghost hidden in Yahoo

32:48.480 --> 32:51.760
answers. Hidden in the hedge maze of terrible methods. This is the closest we've ever gotten.

32:52.560 --> 32:58.400
Is this gentleman's concern that a tree would report him to the police? For tree,

32:58.400 --> 33:05.440
say for arboreal sex crimes. Uh-huh. I don't think that that's a concern. Then what other law,

33:05.440 --> 33:13.040
besides just being completely indecent in public, which is a law, no matter what you're having sex

33:13.040 --> 33:20.480
with wrong. Go wrong. Go. Here's what I'm saying. Here's what's upsetting. If your fence is high

33:20.480 --> 33:25.120
enough, people could be fucking trees. People could be fucking trees. They could have trees

33:25.120 --> 33:30.480
fucking them or each other. They could have grown the trees into a position that makes it look like

33:30.480 --> 33:36.480
they're having sex. I'm talking about branches and the bird holes and the fucking man, a nasty mess.

33:36.480 --> 33:42.240
A nasty mess. So wait, is your concern that this is like rampant? I'm saying who knows? If you walk

33:42.240 --> 33:46.800
by a house with an eight foot fence, you just go ahead and assume that they are fucking something

33:46.800 --> 33:51.120
they should not be. Yeah. And spray paint on the fence. Tree fuckers go home. Yeah.

33:51.120 --> 33:58.320
And then just spend every night worrying about white ash beetles. Yeah. Termites. I mean,

33:59.200 --> 34:04.480
I think people are stumping on the reg. You do think people are stumping right now somewhere in

34:04.480 --> 34:11.120
this world. Okay. Now I get the t-shirts. Uh, stumpers have wood. Yeah.

34:11.120 --> 34:19.920
Um, it upsets me that we can find loopholes in our legal system to allow this kind of thing.

34:19.920 --> 34:24.160
Aren't law supposed to keep you from doing really upsetting things? Isn't that the whole idea?

34:24.160 --> 34:28.160
I want the fucking law and order special victims unit to like kick in the door and be like,

34:28.160 --> 34:33.040
hey, sex police, don't move. Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing

34:33.040 --> 34:37.040
this? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing

34:37.040 --> 34:43.760
the door and be like, hey, sex police, don't move. Why do we even have special? Tree fucker.

34:43.760 --> 34:48.240
Yeah. Why even have the SVU if they're not going to stop shit like this from happening?

34:48.240 --> 34:52.160
Cause psychically it's in my brain. Like there's a tiny, here's what you guys may not realize about

34:52.160 --> 34:58.640
my brain is just by saying that word, saying like tree fucker. Now in my brain, there's a constantly

34:58.640 --> 35:03.280
a 24 seven until the day I die, a tiny man, fucking a tiny tree in my brain. And he's just

35:03.280 --> 35:09.360
shouting tree fucker, tree fucker, tree fucker, tree fucker, or tree man, penis intercourse,

35:09.360 --> 35:16.080
intercourse, intercourse. Like it can't be stopped. Please stop the noise, but you can't stop. I want

35:16.080 --> 35:20.240
fucking ice tea to kick in the door and be like, stop SVU. And he can't do that in your brain.

35:20.240 --> 35:23.920
He's got to hold on. I got to incept him in there and get, get him out. Brain iced tea.

35:23.920 --> 35:31.680
Guys, Griffin, Griffin's eyeballs are bleeding. I think he incepted too much.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.400
Don't have sex with trees.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.240
Don't have sex with.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.200
There's guys.

35:37.200 --> 35:40.880
If only to avoid the horrifying half human, half tree babies.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.000
And also the dick splinters. Stop it.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.560
Listen, you motherfuckers, dryads have to come from somewhere. I want them to walk the earth

35:48.560 --> 35:51.520
and this is the only way to get it done. It may not be pleasant. It may not even be,

35:51.520 --> 35:55.920
it's questionably legal, but if we're going to have someone to bestow upon us,

35:56.480 --> 35:58.160
like special tree powers.

35:58.160 --> 35:58.800
Dryad magic.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.080
Dryad magic, yeah.

36:00.080 --> 36:06.080
I would like to imagine that dryout babies are just completely like boring and normal people.

36:06.080 --> 36:09.280
And you see like a half human, half tree and you're like, give me your wisdom. And he's just

36:09.280 --> 36:13.520
like, dude, I work at the plant. I got nothing. No pun intended.

36:13.520 --> 36:14.800
I work on my shit models.

36:14.800 --> 36:21.520
When you guys were younger, did you ever read the taking tree?

36:22.640 --> 36:23.360
Take the tree.

36:25.440 --> 36:26.800
Give me that sap.

36:29.280 --> 36:31.440
Oh, I'm sad in my brain.

36:31.440 --> 36:32.000
Yeah, me too.

36:32.000 --> 36:32.480
This sucks.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.080
Just ruined a children's book for everybody.

36:34.080 --> 36:34.480
This sucks.

36:34.480 --> 36:37.200
How many other children, I've done Horton Hizze Who and I've done The Giving Tree.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.480
What else can I ruin today?

36:39.040 --> 36:41.360
Yeah, you told the show, the podcast.

36:41.360 --> 36:46.720
Yeah. Hey, my girlfriend and I have a long distance relationship for almost nine months

36:46.720 --> 36:50.400
now. And we're both about to be college freshmen at different universities.

36:50.960 --> 36:55.200
As of the past few days, however, she has determined that she wants

36:55.200 --> 37:00.480
to back out for a semester or two and go home to build her confidence.

37:01.040 --> 37:06.320
I think this is a huge mistake, but don't know how to correctly approach her about it.

37:07.280 --> 37:10.400
I want to be supportive at every corner, but at the same time,

37:10.400 --> 37:12.640
I want to make sure she's making the right decision.

37:12.640 --> 37:13.840
Worried in Wilmington.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.040
You know, worried.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.800
It's a funny thing about being supportive.

37:19.680 --> 37:26.480
It's that once the person makes the decision, you support them.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.040
Interesting.

37:29.040 --> 37:29.840
Yeah, I know.

37:29.840 --> 37:30.800
You back them up.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.720
You just do the thing the word says.

37:32.720 --> 37:37.040
Right, because if you say like, I don't think you're doing the right thing, you're messing

37:37.040 --> 37:40.240
up, you're going to be perpetually messing up in my eyes.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.560
I don't think that's supporting the person.

37:42.560 --> 37:43.840
Like, she's a big girl.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.880
Like, she knows what she's doing.

37:46.880 --> 37:51.200
Okay, so if you're just trying to be supportive, I agree with Justin.

37:51.840 --> 37:56.480
However, there is a certain amount of like, like teaching someone to drive.

37:56.480 --> 38:01.680
If they're swerving towards a tree, you grab the wheel and you, you know,

38:01.680 --> 38:03.600
you guide them away from hitting that tree.

38:03.600 --> 38:07.600
No, you got to be supportive and you got to respect their decision to drive you into a

38:07.600 --> 38:07.920
tree.

38:07.920 --> 38:10.160
Well, guys, seriously think about this for a second.

38:10.160 --> 38:19.200
How, how many times have you, how many times have you made a decision and then someone

38:19.200 --> 38:24.880
tells you a big serious decision and someone tells you, you know, it's the wrong way to

38:24.880 --> 38:28.160
go and you've changed your mind against your own free will.

38:28.160 --> 38:31.440
Like, it's, it's something that you didn't want to do, but that person changed your mind.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.120
That never, ever happens.

38:33.120 --> 38:36.320
The only time we take people's advice is when it's justification for what we already want

38:36.320 --> 38:36.800
to do.

38:36.800 --> 38:37.520
That's not true.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.560
I think that's an excellent point.

38:40.560 --> 38:43.360
No, no, people, I think it's absolutely correct.

38:43.360 --> 38:47.520
When people ask for advice, what they want is someone to support them.

38:47.520 --> 38:50.480
And if you really care about her, I say you just support this decision.

38:50.480 --> 38:52.560
She's smart enough to make her own choices.

38:52.560 --> 38:55.600
Like she knows her own, her own life and her own mind.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.800
I just don't think you're, I don't think talking, trying to talk her out of things is the way

38:58.800 --> 38:59.040
to go.

38:59.040 --> 39:02.480
I think there can be a bias that you can have in your own brain where like when you have

39:02.480 --> 39:05.920
a tough decision like this, you can be leaning towards one or the other, but I think you're

39:05.920 --> 39:07.760
still susceptible to advice.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.320
I think that's kind of a messed up way to look at things.

39:10.320 --> 39:13.360
Well, no, especially in this case, she didn't ask for his advice.

39:13.920 --> 39:14.960
She didn't want his opinion.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.080
That's true.

39:16.080 --> 39:21.760
She didn't say like, Hey, if someone's asked, the reason I point this out is that if she

39:21.760 --> 39:25.680
was asking for your advice and she was kind of like on the fence, one or the other for

39:25.680 --> 39:26.000
sure.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.400
Like tell her what you think, but trying to convince someone to do something they don't

39:30.400 --> 39:35.600
want to do, I think is going to be a huge source of undue stress in your relationship.

39:35.600 --> 39:38.000
Let's get specifically into this question though.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.840
She wants to go home to build her confidence.

39:39.840 --> 39:43.920
I think that there's, instead of giving her advice, I think that you can help her do that

39:43.920 --> 39:49.520
and still get her to go to school, still get her to keep up her regular school schedule

39:49.520 --> 39:53.280
because this is the kind of thing where it's not like a, I'm not saying it's the right

39:53.280 --> 39:56.720
choice for everybody all the time, but if you think it's the right choice for her and

39:56.720 --> 40:02.960
assuming that you know her pretty well, I think it's your duty to try and influence

40:02.960 --> 40:04.080
her decision.

40:04.080 --> 40:11.680
I just worry that going home and backing out of school isn't a good way to build confidence.

40:11.680 --> 40:12.640
Not at all.

40:12.640 --> 40:18.720
It seems like she's afraid to start this next step of college and so she's just not

40:18.720 --> 40:21.920
going to do it and that is not confidence building at all.

40:21.920 --> 40:28.320
So that's what concerns me, is that it's not the idea of you saying it is a bad idea,

40:28.320 --> 40:30.240
it's that it is a bad idea.

40:30.240 --> 40:33.680
And if it's, you said you're going to different universities, if it's because she doesn't

40:33.680 --> 40:35.760
want to leave you, you need to.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.600
That's not good at all.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.120
That's not good.

40:39.120 --> 40:44.000
Well, is she, is her staying, like is the place she's staying in near the university

40:44.000 --> 40:44.720
that he's going to?

40:44.720 --> 40:47.840
I don't think, that was not made explicitly clear.

40:47.840 --> 40:53.600
But if that is the case, then that's, that is definitely something you need to interject

40:53.600 --> 40:55.360
and be like, hey, don't do this for me.

40:55.360 --> 41:00.480
Like, this is, this is a super important thing that you have to do and don't do it

41:00.480 --> 41:01.840
for this relationship.

41:01.840 --> 41:05.440
I think that in all things, if you're looking for a way to approach it and actually like

41:05.440 --> 41:09.440
bring it up, asking questions is better than making statements.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.800
If you're like, why do you think, why do you feel you need to do this?

41:13.440 --> 41:15.600
What do you, what's your plan?

41:15.600 --> 41:18.400
You know, that kind of thing is supposed to going, this is a bad idea.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.520
I don't think you should do it.

41:20.080 --> 41:21.760
Like, cause then that's you.

41:21.760 --> 41:26.320
But asking her questions will help her to realize if it's something she really wants

41:26.320 --> 41:27.040
to do or not.

41:29.120 --> 41:33.600
Um, yeah, it's a, it's a sticky, it's a sticky situation.

41:34.480 --> 41:40.160
Um, but I, I just don't try to impose your own thoughts because she's looked at this

41:40.160 --> 41:44.160
at different angles, but there's ways to, what I would do if I were you is really talk

41:44.160 --> 41:47.760
to her about it and really figure out what's really at the root of it.

41:47.760 --> 41:52.960
Try your best to understand it because if you, if you understand what she's feeling

41:52.960 --> 41:55.360
completely, then you are going to see things her way.

41:55.360 --> 41:57.920
You will, you will see why she is staying there.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.000
Um, and then you can kind of go from there.

42:00.000 --> 42:08.160
But I would first, I think your first step is to try to, uh, to, um, um, understand

42:08.160 --> 42:10.640
where she's coming from personally.

42:11.280 --> 42:11.920
That's what I think.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.760
You know what I think?

42:13.760 --> 42:15.040
What maybe we should do a Yahoo.

42:15.040 --> 42:15.280
Yeah.

42:16.480 --> 42:18.800
Can we do the one about the tree sex again?

42:18.800 --> 42:19.680
Yeah, sure.

42:19.680 --> 42:20.080
No.

42:20.080 --> 42:22.320
This, hey, sex, the tree sex.

42:22.320 --> 42:23.040
What's up with that?

42:24.480 --> 42:26.800
Um, how about this one?

42:27.440 --> 42:28.880
This one's sent by Galiayali.

42:28.880 --> 42:29.360
It's by Yahoo!

42:29.360 --> 42:31.040
Interest user Jordan Crum.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.160
Remember that last name, everybody.

42:32.160 --> 42:32.880
Jordan Crum.

42:33.760 --> 42:37.360
My last name is Crum and I'm running for 4-H president at my school.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.280
I need good slogans for my posters.

42:39.280 --> 42:41.040
4-H is green and for the planet.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.560
Please put more than one slogan.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.520
Oh, don't worry, Jordan.

42:45.200 --> 42:45.920
Done and done.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.680
Crumble believable.

42:47.680 --> 42:47.920
Fuck.

42:47.920 --> 42:48.640
You beat me to it.

42:52.800 --> 42:54.080
Can we send it to that song?

43:00.480 --> 43:04.400
I wish that that wasn't always in my head all the time.

43:04.400 --> 43:09.120
24 seven and just that like two seconds of music.

43:09.120 --> 43:09.840
Unbelievable.

43:09.840 --> 43:10.640
Unbelievable.

43:10.640 --> 43:11.360
Unbelievable.

43:11.360 --> 43:12.240
Unbelievable.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.080
Time to pull the crumbilical cord.

43:14.080 --> 43:14.400
Yeah.

43:14.400 --> 43:15.520
And secede.

43:15.520 --> 43:16.240
Pull it.

43:16.240 --> 43:16.640
Pull it.

43:16.640 --> 43:17.040
Cut it.

43:17.040 --> 43:17.840
Cut the crumbilical cord.

43:17.840 --> 43:18.880
No, I like pulling it better.

43:20.480 --> 43:21.440
I'll get out of this.

43:21.440 --> 43:22.400
I'll get out of this one.

43:24.160 --> 43:24.800
He's not like that.

43:24.800 --> 43:25.920
We are cartoonists.

43:25.920 --> 43:26.400
Crumb it.

43:29.920 --> 43:30.560
Jesus.

43:30.560 --> 43:34.480
Um, uh, uh,

43:36.080 --> 43:37.200
come and I'm looking at you.

43:37.200 --> 43:37.840
Give me something.

43:37.840 --> 43:38.640
Look at my eyes.

43:38.640 --> 43:39.440
Crumb.

43:39.440 --> 43:40.080
Crumb.

43:40.080 --> 43:40.560
Crumb.

43:41.280 --> 43:43.360
There's nothing I don't want to say that isn't.

43:44.560 --> 43:45.920
Put it on your earmuffs, everybody.

43:47.680 --> 43:48.000
Come.

43:50.000 --> 43:50.800
I'm coming.

43:52.800 --> 43:55.760
Uh, let's see some of the, uh, uh, some of the really,

43:56.640 --> 43:59.040
some of the really stellar answers here.

43:59.040 --> 44:02.640
Uh, several slogans for crumb for fourth president are don't be.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.200
No, I'm sorry.

44:03.200 --> 44:03.440
What?

44:04.480 --> 44:05.840
Crumb for fourth president.

44:05.840 --> 44:06.160
Okay.

44:06.880 --> 44:08.400
The third president down the line.

44:08.400 --> 44:08.720
Okay.

44:08.720 --> 44:09.600
Don't be glum.

44:09.600 --> 44:10.560
Vote for crumb.

44:10.560 --> 44:11.360
Fourth president.

44:11.920 --> 44:12.960
Not so great.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.000
Not a good start.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.400
Don't be going to be glum, but give a ho ho hum.

44:18.400 --> 44:19.120
Vote for crumb.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.240
Fourth president.

44:20.240 --> 44:20.740
Nope.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.320
That's not it at all.

44:22.320 --> 44:23.760
Who are you voting for?

44:23.760 --> 44:25.280
Ho ho hum.

44:25.280 --> 44:26.480
Crumb.

44:26.480 --> 44:27.040
Crumb.

44:27.040 --> 44:29.120
Tip of canoe and Tyler too.

44:29.120 --> 44:30.480
I give out chewing gum.

44:30.480 --> 44:31.520
If you vote for crumb.

44:31.520 --> 44:36.640
For no, no, that's all these things make me want to not vote for crumb.

44:36.640 --> 44:39.360
Make a rule of thumb vote for president crumb.

44:40.160 --> 44:42.320
That's if he's president crumb.

44:42.320 --> 44:44.320
He doesn't need your vote to be fair.

44:44.320 --> 44:46.640
President crumb sounds like a warlord.

44:46.640 --> 44:49.040
And I love don't become numb.

44:49.040 --> 44:49.920
Vote for crumb.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.120
He will lead us alive.

44:51.120 --> 44:52.320
Our school will thrive.

44:52.320 --> 44:53.360
What the fuck?

44:53.360 --> 45:03.040
To a glorious revolution over Lord crumb and the, and the floor of the cafeteria.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.480
We stay with Brad.

45:04.480 --> 45:10.880
I'm seeing in my, I'm seeing in my mind like a chubby version of beans from even Stevens

45:10.880 --> 45:11.920
at that kid.

45:11.920 --> 45:14.640
Only he's in the Obama poster, the hope poster.

45:14.640 --> 45:16.480
When he said hope, it just says crumb.

45:17.920 --> 45:19.040
Fuck Justin Russo.

45:19.040 --> 45:19.360
Make that.

45:19.360 --> 45:20.640
Hey Justin Russo.

45:20.640 --> 45:21.280
Make that t-shirt.

45:21.280 --> 45:21.920
It sits on you.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.720
By the way, those suggestions came from George.

45:24.720 --> 45:28.560
He's a college professor of education at four universities in Illinois, New York, South

45:28.560 --> 45:30.240
Carolina, and the district of Columbia.

45:30.240 --> 45:31.440
He likes making slogans.

45:31.440 --> 45:36.640
So if you go to college in one of those four states, you should probably move somewhere

45:36.640 --> 45:37.280
else.

45:37.280 --> 45:38.400
Dude was in DC.

45:38.400 --> 45:41.520
Why didn't he give Obama some of his help for 2012?

45:41.520 --> 45:45.520
Like Obama, yo mama, vote for fourth president.

45:48.080 --> 45:49.280
What is fourth president?

45:49.280 --> 45:50.880
You make it sound like fourth meal.

45:50.880 --> 45:53.680
President Obama, he killed Osama, fourth president.

45:55.600 --> 45:56.960
Get him, give him your votes.

45:57.920 --> 45:59.360
Let's keep this country alive.

45:59.360 --> 46:00.320
It must thrive.

46:00.320 --> 46:01.520
Obama.

46:01.520 --> 46:04.160
Is there a who's Harry Chrome angle we're not approaching?

46:06.720 --> 46:06.960
No.

46:09.920 --> 46:10.480
Okay.

46:10.480 --> 46:12.240
All right, that's good enough for me.

46:12.240 --> 46:15.680
Hey, you're a history, you're a college professor of education.

46:15.680 --> 46:16.400
You're fired.

46:16.400 --> 46:17.520
Go find another state.

46:17.520 --> 46:19.120
That happened to him three times.

46:20.080 --> 46:21.680
Your slogans are terrible.

46:22.240 --> 46:23.600
Do you think he teaches politics?

46:23.600 --> 46:26.800
Oh no, I think I bet he teaches education about politics.

46:26.800 --> 46:31.600
I bet, I bet that he knows every single slogan has ever been done in any presidential campaign

46:31.600 --> 46:37.120
and he has compiled that information to create these surefire winning machines.

46:37.120 --> 46:38.720
You gotta come up with something snappy.

46:38.720 --> 46:39.600
I like Ike.

46:39.600 --> 46:40.240
That's great.

46:40.240 --> 46:40.720
Yeah.

46:40.720 --> 46:42.000
I chum crumb.

46:42.000 --> 46:42.480
Yeah.

46:42.480 --> 46:43.040
Is that good?

46:46.320 --> 46:46.640
No.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.160
Big chum crumb.

46:48.160 --> 46:48.960
Big chum crumb.

46:49.840 --> 46:54.640
I think it's time to accept that you don't have a successful political name.

46:54.640 --> 46:55.280
Yeah, you don't.

46:55.280 --> 46:57.280
Can we change it to like Broderick?

46:58.000 --> 46:58.640
Yeah.

46:58.640 --> 47:01.120
Rock Broderick, president and king.

47:02.800 --> 47:05.760
Rock Broderick, sexual desire.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.680
What is this voice that you're doing?

47:07.680 --> 47:10.800
What about, what about if you ditch all the president shit?

47:10.800 --> 47:13.120
What if you focus on your sexual potency?

47:13.120 --> 47:13.760
Yeah.

47:13.760 --> 47:14.560
Crumb.

47:14.560 --> 47:16.160
He is adequate.

47:16.160 --> 47:17.520
He'll get the job done.

47:17.520 --> 47:18.000
Crumb.

47:18.720 --> 47:21.200
He'll do the electric slide with you at the dance.

47:21.200 --> 47:21.680
Crumb.

47:21.680 --> 47:25.600
Crumb, sporting boner since 2006.

47:25.600 --> 47:28.240
Crumb's got more boners than he knows what to do with.

47:28.240 --> 47:29.120
Fourth president.

47:29.120 --> 47:29.920
Crumb.

47:29.920 --> 47:32.480
He'll help you with your long division.

47:32.480 --> 47:33.600
He's got that shit down.

47:33.600 --> 47:34.320
He's in fourth grade.

47:36.160 --> 47:36.400
Yeah.

47:36.400 --> 47:41.680
I mean, the trick for winning a presidential election with Travis, I'm sure you know all

47:41.680 --> 47:49.840
about is to find your sort of your area of expertise in fourth grade.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.440
Like, are you a basketball star?

47:51.440 --> 47:55.760
Because if that's the case, and like, Crumb makes all the points for the big team.

47:55.760 --> 47:56.240
Slam dunk.

47:56.800 --> 48:03.840
I would suggest just a series of, how about a series of pictures of him as a basketball

48:03.840 --> 48:11.760
star, as a chemist, as President Obama, but just the exact same facial expression.

48:11.760 --> 48:13.600
His arm around Barry.

48:15.280 --> 48:16.720
We caught him together, Barry.

48:16.720 --> 48:17.120
Got him.

48:17.120 --> 48:18.400
Couldn't have done it without you.

48:18.400 --> 48:19.680
And you couldn't have done it without me.

48:19.680 --> 48:21.680
Crumb, fourth president.

48:21.680 --> 48:22.880
Oh, fuck, you're so good.

48:24.400 --> 48:25.920
He's in fourth grader.

48:25.920 --> 48:27.760
Yeah, but he's also sexually potent.

48:27.760 --> 48:29.840
I'm trying to, I'm bringing all of our birds into roost.

48:31.040 --> 48:32.560
Oh my God, Griffin.

48:32.560 --> 48:36.160
That answer was put onto this question 13 hours ago.

48:36.160 --> 48:37.600
I know, it's not piping hot.

48:39.600 --> 48:41.280
George is still out there helping people.

48:42.960 --> 48:43.440
Wait.

48:43.440 --> 48:44.800
He must be stopped.

48:44.800 --> 48:46.080
Crumb just put this.

48:46.080 --> 48:48.960
Okay, guys, this is such a rare opportunity.

48:48.960 --> 48:53.760
Crumb just put this question up 15 hours ago and there are still three days left to answer.

48:53.760 --> 48:57.280
If you can find this question and start giving him some crummy suggestions.

49:00.000 --> 49:00.560
I love it.

49:00.560 --> 49:01.680
Okay, we just tapped into it.

49:02.480 --> 49:04.080
You're crummy as president.

49:04.080 --> 49:04.480
Yeah.

49:04.480 --> 49:05.200
Well, I know, I know.

49:05.200 --> 49:08.400
I think it has to be his name's Crumb, but he's not crummy.

49:08.400 --> 49:08.880
Vote for him.

49:08.880 --> 49:09.680
Don't be a dummy.

49:12.480 --> 49:13.200
His name's Crumb.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.000
He's not coming.

49:15.040 --> 49:16.080
He's not coming.

49:16.080 --> 49:16.880
Next question.

49:16.880 --> 49:17.440
Don't tell.

49:17.440 --> 49:18.400
Don't tell.

49:18.400 --> 49:23.280
Listen, I'm saying get your mom, get a fucking Elmer's glue stick, get some sprinkle sparkles

49:23.280 --> 49:25.440
and just fucking make that slogan happen.

49:25.440 --> 49:25.760
Yeah.

49:25.760 --> 49:29.520
Picture you high-fiving Barack Obama holding Osama bin Laden's head.

49:30.240 --> 49:31.600
Fantastic.

49:31.600 --> 49:32.480
Guaranteed win.

49:33.040 --> 49:34.960
So hey, I run a lot.

49:35.760 --> 49:36.400
Just a fact.

49:36.960 --> 49:42.240
And because of that, I'm usually wearing short shorts around my house and just in general.

49:42.800 --> 49:45.760
I love them because they're so comfortable and easy to wear.

49:45.760 --> 49:50.480
Everyone I know that isn't a runner hates them and sometimes they're even appalled by

49:50.480 --> 49:52.240
the fact that I'm wearing them.

49:52.240 --> 49:55.280
Stop going to funerals in your short shorts.

49:55.280 --> 50:00.000
What I'm asking you is why do people hate short shorts?

50:00.000 --> 50:00.800
I love them.

50:00.800 --> 50:01.840
David, North Carolina.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.120
You know what bothers me about this show?

50:04.640 --> 50:09.920
We say pretty clearly, I think, in all of our promotional materials, our TV ads, our

50:09.920 --> 50:14.000
Super Bowl spot, we say it's an advice show for the modern era.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.760
David has come to us not seeking advice.

50:17.760 --> 50:25.200
He has his decision about short shorts is cast in iron.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.120
I think this is an opportunity.

50:27.120 --> 50:31.920
I think it's like one of those things where no one goes to a psychiatrist because they're

50:31.920 --> 50:36.560
afraid they have narcissism, like they go because they're depressed because nobody realizes

50:36.560 --> 50:37.840
how awesome they are.

50:37.840 --> 50:38.400
Yeah.

50:38.400 --> 50:40.080
I think that that's what this is.

50:40.080 --> 50:46.720
I think that that's what this is. David has not asked for advice, but I feel David needs

50:46.720 --> 50:47.200
advice.

50:48.640 --> 50:50.320
How short are these shorts, Doc?

50:50.880 --> 50:52.160
That's my question.

50:52.160 --> 50:53.360
What are we talking about here?

50:53.360 --> 50:55.520
Are we talking about some Daisy Dukes?

50:55.520 --> 50:57.840
Are we talking about some Jordan Crums?

50:57.840 --> 50:59.280
Like, how short are these?

51:00.640 --> 51:03.200
Oh, in order for that joke to make sense, you have to see the picture of Jordan Crum

51:03.200 --> 51:04.400
that we're both looking at right now.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.640
His t-shirt is so long, I can't even see it.

51:08.640 --> 51:12.240
It looks like he's like a girl in a poison music video right now.

51:12.240 --> 51:13.360
There's sparks everywhere.

51:14.400 --> 51:21.760
I would also say that short shorts in this situation sound like a uniform for running.

51:22.720 --> 51:27.360
So you should probably relegate it to that time and only that time.

51:27.360 --> 51:31.520
Yeah, just wear them while you're running and no other time ever.

51:31.520 --> 51:36.720
That's like if I were a 55 year old surfer and I just rolled around in a wetsuit all

51:36.720 --> 51:37.520
the time.

51:37.520 --> 51:42.160
It's like all the time or floated around in a wetsuit until the Coast Guard came by.

51:42.160 --> 51:47.920
I'm not sure I'm even cool with it while it's running because when I run, when I express

51:47.920 --> 51:53.760
myself through movement and I see a gentleman pass by, which they're keen to do because

51:53.760 --> 51:59.040
I'm not the fastest runner, and I see them wearing those short shorts and it sounds like

51:59.040 --> 52:01.760
their thighs are high-fiving over and over again.

52:01.760 --> 52:05.520
Well then you just do a slight wave and say, please don't try to see my balls.

52:05.520 --> 52:08.400
Yeah, like I can, I can't not see his balls.

52:08.400 --> 52:11.280
Like they're in, they're my, they're in my everything at that point.

52:11.280 --> 52:14.880
Like in that brief moment where they pass by and they always touch me.

52:15.520 --> 52:18.640
They always just brush up against and I feel their moist leg.

52:18.640 --> 52:19.680
They're moist balls.

52:20.400 --> 52:21.920
No, not, no, not his balls.

52:21.920 --> 52:23.200
No, don't be crass.

52:25.200 --> 52:26.160
His almost balls.

52:26.800 --> 52:27.680
Okay.

52:27.680 --> 52:30.560
Still is no, no zone, but like his almost balls.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.400
Why are you not wearing them?

52:32.400 --> 52:34.640
Why are you wearing them any other time?

52:34.640 --> 52:36.000
There it's a running uniform.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.680
Like I don't wear my cleats for sports inside the house.

52:40.480 --> 52:41.520
My sport cleats.

52:41.520 --> 52:42.880
I'm saying don't wear them at all.

52:42.880 --> 52:48.160
I'm saying when I get done with my desert horse race, I take off my job purse.

52:48.160 --> 52:48.560
Yeah.

52:48.560 --> 52:49.280
Yeah.

52:49.280 --> 52:53.680
Oh, and David, just so we're clear, people don't hate your short shorts.

52:53.680 --> 52:54.960
People hate your legs.

52:56.080 --> 52:58.000
They don't want to see all the things.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.360
They don't want to see your pasty, sweaty getaway sticks.

53:01.360 --> 53:01.680
Yeah.

53:01.680 --> 53:03.840
What kind of legs are we talking about here?

53:03.840 --> 53:10.080
Are we talking about like some daddy, long legs, lanky ass, pale and pasties or are we

53:10.080 --> 53:11.920
talking about, or are they jealous?

53:11.920 --> 53:15.200
Are we talking about legs that look like Robin Williams fingers?

53:16.400 --> 53:21.440
Maybe we're talking about legs that go all the way up and everybody's just jealous.

53:22.320 --> 53:27.840
Are we talking about some Michael Sarah's or are we talking about some Bruce Valanches?

53:28.800 --> 53:30.000
They're both bad.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.360
Like, I don't understand what you're saying.

53:31.360 --> 53:34.480
I know, I'm trying to gauge what kind of...

53:34.480 --> 53:36.960
Have you ever seen a dude's legs and gone, aw yeah?

53:39.760 --> 53:40.960
Except for Timothy Olyphant, obviously.

53:40.960 --> 53:42.720
Other than Timothy Olyphant, yeah?

53:42.720 --> 53:43.120
Yeah.

53:43.120 --> 53:43.760
Go to jail.

53:44.800 --> 53:45.920
Do not pass go.

53:45.920 --> 53:46.400
I haven't...

53:46.400 --> 53:47.840
I don't think that's a good look for a dude.

53:47.840 --> 53:48.480
I don't think a...

53:50.320 --> 53:51.120
I haven't seen a...

53:51.120 --> 53:54.000
I haven't talked to a lady who appreciates a good leg.

53:54.000 --> 53:54.560
I think that's...

53:55.360 --> 53:55.840
I like...

53:55.840 --> 53:57.360
I know ladies like buns.

53:57.360 --> 54:00.320
Yeah, they like a tight bun, but I guess you get that by running.

54:00.320 --> 54:02.400
So you want him to run in assless chaps.

54:03.840 --> 54:06.080
Or just run in jeans, everybody.

54:06.080 --> 54:08.000
Can you just hide your fucking gross legs?

54:08.000 --> 54:11.520
Nothing like the comfort and ease of jeans.

54:11.520 --> 54:12.480
Yeah, because you can...

54:12.480 --> 54:16.480
Jeans, you can get some cargo jeans going and you can tuck bottles of water in there.

54:16.480 --> 54:18.800
You can put your Zune and your bottle of water in there.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.640
And your bag of cheese nips.

54:20.640 --> 54:22.080
Yeah, bag of cheese nips.

54:22.080 --> 54:24.640
Maybe a Gameboy, because it gets boring out there on the street.

54:28.080 --> 54:28.960
Like, how's your run going?

54:28.960 --> 54:29.840
Good, catching them all.

54:29.840 --> 54:30.240
You hungry?

54:30.240 --> 54:30.800
I got nips.

54:34.720 --> 54:38.320
If it helps, you can wear your short shorts underneath the jeans.

54:38.320 --> 54:39.760
Yeah, that makes you feel better.

54:39.760 --> 54:42.720
You just need to feel that mesh close to your scrote.

54:43.280 --> 54:47.760
Hey, I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first, quick housekeeping stuff.

54:49.040 --> 54:51.360
We are at mbmbam.com.

54:51.360 --> 54:55.040
That is the letters of my brother, mybrotherandme.com.

54:55.760 --> 54:56.880
You probably figured that out.

54:56.880 --> 55:02.640
Our Twitter is at mbmbam.

55:03.680 --> 55:07.200
Griffin, can you tell them how they can reach out to us, how they can reach us?

55:07.840 --> 55:15.120
You can email us at mbmbam at maximumfun.org or just mbmbam at gmail.com,

55:15.120 --> 55:17.040
if that's how you like to do what you do.

55:19.200 --> 55:21.120
Or you can just shout at us on Twitter.

55:21.120 --> 55:22.000
We're always looking.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.720
We're always looking out for that hashtag and that at sign.

55:24.720 --> 55:29.680
And if you need a more direct way, you can call Griffin at 1-900-HOT-PANTS.

55:29.680 --> 55:31.840
Hot pants with a Z.

55:31.840 --> 55:32.880
Hottest pants.

55:32.880 --> 55:35.280
Don't call that number, though, because it's probably something bad.

55:36.880 --> 55:40.240
I want to thank John and Roderick in the long winters for the use of their theme song.

55:40.240 --> 55:44.080
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed, which, just go buy that.

55:44.080 --> 55:45.200
We're in Seattle right now.

55:45.200 --> 55:48.480
I've just been thinking about just hunting him down like an antelope,

55:48.480 --> 55:50.240
like some sort of wild creature.

55:50.240 --> 55:52.560
Well, then you tag him and release him back.

55:52.560 --> 55:54.000
Tag him and release him, but thank him.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.680
I just want to thank him personally for it.

55:55.680 --> 55:56.160
Thank you.

55:56.160 --> 55:58.480
Hey, John, thank you for the use of your song.

55:58.480 --> 55:59.280
It's so good.

55:59.280 --> 56:03.840
I'm sorry, people have asked, what's our closing song?

56:04.880 --> 56:07.360
Oh, it's off Girl Talks Feed the Animals.

56:07.360 --> 56:09.920
It's Play Your Part Part Two, the very ending of it.

56:09.920 --> 56:11.040
Thank you, Girl Talk.

56:11.040 --> 56:12.080
Play Your Part Part Two.

56:13.680 --> 56:17.360
And thank you to everybody who talked about us on Twitter this week.

56:18.080 --> 56:18.960
Always Amy H.

56:18.960 --> 56:23.520
I always devoted in her talking about us.

56:25.360 --> 56:26.400
Rocks in his head.

56:26.400 --> 56:27.200
I appreciate that.

56:28.400 --> 56:29.440
Ryan Winslet.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.360
Galen, our bold hero.

56:32.160 --> 56:33.200
Bird Lord.

56:33.200 --> 56:34.800
Krista Whalen, as always.

56:34.800 --> 56:41.600
I want to thank Ashbrook K, now that I look at it again,

56:41.600 --> 56:47.120
who wondered if the quake would get mentioned on this week's My Brother, My Brother and Me.

56:47.120 --> 56:49.440
And sadly, it will not.

56:49.440 --> 56:50.480
Thanks to Ham Doctors.

56:50.480 --> 56:58.800
We met Oni Davin and our friend Lindsay here in Seattle.

56:59.840 --> 57:02.480
So thank you to both of them for being so sweet.

57:03.520 --> 57:06.160
And speaking of people we met, we met Emily Carroll,

57:06.160 --> 57:08.480
who you can find at Emily Terrible on Twitter.

57:08.480 --> 57:09.520
She does the best art.

57:11.440 --> 57:12.560
I was super nervous.

57:12.560 --> 57:15.840
I was actually super nervous because it's like you make the best art,

57:15.840 --> 57:18.000
but now you're talking to us.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.240
She made an NBNBAM art.

57:20.240 --> 57:21.040
She made an art.

57:21.040 --> 57:22.160
I'm sure everybody saw it.

57:22.160 --> 57:24.000
It's well got blowed up worldwide.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.720
But if you didn't just track her down.

57:26.720 --> 57:27.520
It's in the forums.

57:27.520 --> 57:29.280
It's in the forums.

57:29.280 --> 57:32.640
You can find it at Maximumfun.org and then just click forums.

57:32.640 --> 57:34.880
And I want to throw out a special thanks to Joel Siebert,

57:34.880 --> 57:37.520
who also thought that all checks had to be in cursive.

57:37.520 --> 57:39.200
So I'm glad that he was there with me.

57:39.760 --> 57:40.400
Thank you, Joel.

57:40.400 --> 57:45.040
Uh, if you'd like to have us talk about a special event in your life

57:45.040 --> 57:48.880
or your corporation that wants us to promote your product.

57:48.880 --> 57:51.680
Or if you're a lonely gentleman and you want to-

57:51.680 --> 57:53.040
Still haven't done that personal ad.

57:53.040 --> 57:53.840
You want to get a person-

57:53.840 --> 57:56.560
If you want us to boost your sexual confidence.

57:57.600 --> 57:58.560
So you can go to school.

57:58.560 --> 57:59.680
So you can go to school finally.

57:59.680 --> 58:01.280
Then we can do that for you.

58:01.280 --> 58:03.600
Listen, I'm so hungry right now.

58:03.600 --> 58:05.520
Max, you got to give the address, stupid.

58:05.520 --> 58:08.240
It's Maximumfun.org, right?

58:08.240 --> 58:08.880
Not.com.

58:08.880 --> 58:11.440
There's a.org.

58:11.440 --> 58:14.080
Maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron.

58:14.080 --> 58:15.360
And we will blow your shit up.

58:16.640 --> 58:17.920
It's affordable.

58:17.920 --> 58:20.560
It's, it's, we'll talk all about you.

58:20.560 --> 58:21.840
Only nice things.

58:21.840 --> 58:23.360
Unless you raise our ire.

58:23.920 --> 58:26.640
And we'll just, we'll blow your shit up on our podcast.

58:26.640 --> 58:28.720
And we will literally say anything you want.

58:28.720 --> 58:31.280
We will, we will suck anything.

58:31.280 --> 58:33.280
We'll say anything for what?

58:33.280 --> 58:34.080
For money.

58:34.080 --> 58:34.800
Say the last thing.

58:34.800 --> 58:35.760
I'm so hungry.

58:35.760 --> 58:36.800
Your show's over.

58:36.800 --> 58:38.400
Aw, 69.

58:38.400 --> 58:40.080
Aw, guys, it's episode 69.

58:40.080 --> 58:42.960
It's already, somebody open a window.

58:45.360 --> 58:47.440
Griffin, fucking say the last question.

58:47.440 --> 58:49.520
No, I want to talk more about episode 69.

58:49.520 --> 58:50.080
I'll read it.

58:50.080 --> 58:51.120
I can see your computer.

58:51.120 --> 58:52.480
But listen, episode 69.

58:52.480 --> 58:54.560
I feel like this is a good, this is a good moment.

58:54.560 --> 58:58.240
Cause I think that we pleased our consumers and they pleased us.

58:58.240 --> 58:59.760
And so I just want to thank.

58:59.760 --> 59:02.400
No, I want to thank every, this is the time for thank yous.

59:02.400 --> 59:05.920
And I want to thank every single one of our listeners for engaging.

59:05.920 --> 59:09.120
We couldn't have done it without you and you couldn't have done it without us.

59:09.120 --> 59:10.880
Yeah, you have to have us.

59:10.880 --> 59:13.040
Just keep, just fucking remember that.

59:13.040 --> 59:15.680

59:15.680 --> 59:19.760
So thanks for, let's just, let's just rub each other's gents.

59:21.440 --> 59:22.640

Just rub some gents.

59:24.560 --> 59:25.600
Thanks everybody.

59:25.600 --> 59:28.720
This final Yahoo was sent in by Galiayali.

59:28.720 --> 59:29.680
Thank you, Galiayali.

59:29.680 --> 59:30.240
It's by Yahoo!

59:30.240 --> 59:36.480
It's user Hottieheart25 who asks, I have canker sores in my mouth.

59:36.480 --> 59:38.640
Is it bad to eat spicy Doritos?

59:40.480 --> 59:41.760
I'm Justin McElroy.

59:41.760 --> 59:42.960
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:42.960 --> 59:44.560

59:44.560 --> 59:46.240
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

59:46.240 --> 59:47.280
Kiss your dad.

59:47.280 --> 59:48.080
Square on the lips.

59:52.080 --> 59:53.760
Keep your heart three stacks.

59:53.760 --> 59:54.800
Keep your heart.

59:54.800 --> 59:56.960
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

59:56.960 --> 59:57.920
Keep your heart.

59:57.920 --> 59:59.280
Man, these girls are smart.

59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.040
Three stacks, these girls are smart.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:30.800
Play your part.
