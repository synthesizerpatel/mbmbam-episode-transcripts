WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:46.640
Hello and welcome, my brother, my brother and me.

00:47.360 --> 00:52.320
Uh, right show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Kevin Spacey.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.080
I'm your, I'm your middle-est brother.

00:56.080 --> 01:03.440
Ah, I got nothing. I'm Louisiana State Senator Jacob Sweetwater.

01:07.600 --> 01:12.720
Listen, you can't make an omelet without breaking a few politics eggs.

01:12.720 --> 01:15.360
Governor, you're drifting into Cosby. Of course, correct.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.200
What an honor it is to have a House of Cards character.

01:19.200 --> 01:23.360
Louisiana State Senator Jacob Sweetwater.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.080
Senator Jacob Sweetwater on our program.

01:26.080 --> 01:30.000
You've been privy to some of the machinations of, uh-

01:30.000 --> 01:31.920
Dog machinations, son.

01:31.920 --> 01:37.120
Yeah. Uh, what, what, what do you think is, has changed about Paul?

01:37.120 --> 01:42.400
You've obviously been a Senator for, uh, 30 years, uh, and, and you've seen,

01:42.400 --> 01:48.240
you know, some of the, the drama and I guess intrigue, uh, that's taking place on Capitol Hill.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.160
I just say most folk ain't got the stomach for it.

01:52.160 --> 01:52.960
Yeah.

01:52.960 --> 01:57.040
I'm saying our countries and states being held by a bunch of-

01:57.040 --> 01:59.360
What the fuck is going on?

01:59.360 --> 02:00.480
What is all of this?

02:01.120 --> 02:02.880
By a bunch of pussy fingers.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.280
What is happening?

02:07.440 --> 02:09.440
Man, Travis is good at improv.

02:10.320 --> 02:13.440
Something happens for 20 seconds he doesn't understand and he starts crying.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.400
I don't know what you're referencing.

02:16.400 --> 02:20.480
This is a good joke to say yes and then say no, help, stop.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.400
Help, help, I need an adult.

02:23.520 --> 02:27.200
Um, I've never, I've seen, I've seen two episodes of House of Cards.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.400
I shouldn't say I've never seen it.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.200
All I remember-

02:29.200 --> 02:29.920
Which member?

02:29.920 --> 02:33.280
Oh God. S1, E4, S1, E8.

02:33.280 --> 02:37.520
Um, I, I don't remember anything about it.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.160
Didn't really leave a mark with me.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.600
I know people are all crazy about it, but Kevin Spacey, that's not what you sound like.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.440
You know what I mean?

02:45.440 --> 02:47.360
Yeah. Why doesn't he just sound like himself?

02:47.360 --> 02:48.800
Yeah, he's a liar.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.200
You sound imposing already.

02:51.200 --> 02:57.040
Like just regular old standard Kevin Spacey basic sounds pretty imposing.

02:57.040 --> 03:01.760
I don't understand why you have to sound all Louisiana state Senator Jacob Sweetwater.

03:01.760 --> 03:08.960
How sweet would it be in the last episode if he like, he becomes president of the United States

03:09.520 --> 03:16.160
and then he flips the switch and nukes everybody on earth from his secret underground bunker

03:16.160 --> 03:19.360
and then he puts on some sunglasses and says, that's right.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.080
This whole time I was K-Pax.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.640
He flies into his spaceship.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.960
It's all been leading up to that.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.520
He's been in so many things.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.240
Yeah. A lot of things.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.600
He's an American treasure.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.200
You know, we knew someone on that House of Cards.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.200
Did we?

03:41.200 --> 03:44.560
Yeah. Nick Reynolds played a cameraman in an episode.

03:44.560 --> 03:45.120
Oh wow.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.080
Yeah. So pretty starstruck.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.160
Big ups to Nick Reynolds if you're listening.

03:50.160 --> 03:50.640
Shout out.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.440
But this show isn't for Nick Reynolds.

03:55.440 --> 03:55.600
No.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.720
It's for you, the listening public.

03:58.720 --> 04:02.880
So we can take your queries and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

04:04.320 --> 04:05.200
Let's get started.

04:06.720 --> 04:12.720
I travel on a lot of planes, trains, buses, and other forms of transportation.

04:12.720 --> 04:16.400
When I do so, I like to watch shows on my computer and some of those shows have nudity

04:16.400 --> 04:20.720
or violence like Game of Thrones, Archer, or The Wire.

04:21.280 --> 04:24.960
Assuming there are no children around, is it okay to watch these kinds of things

04:24.960 --> 04:27.280
where other people could maybe see it?

04:27.280 --> 04:29.040
And that's from Confused Coach.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.520
You really can't lump those three shows in together because yes,

04:33.520 --> 04:39.680
The Wire can be exceedingly violent and Archer can be pretty violent,

04:39.680 --> 04:43.360
but only one of those shows has fisting in it.

04:45.520 --> 04:51.040
I feel like Game of Thrones though at this point has entered into the public zeitgeist enough

04:51.040 --> 04:55.600
that someone would see the shit that goes on in that show,

04:55.600 --> 04:57.440
but then go, well, it's Game of Thrones.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.400
What would you expect?

04:58.400 --> 05:07.840
Nah, there are some scenes of nudity that are lengthy enough

05:07.840 --> 05:13.760
that I would become uncomfortable if someone in the seat next to me was watching and enjoying them.

05:13.760 --> 05:17.920
Well, at that point, you just slightly turn the screen towards them

05:17.920 --> 05:19.840
and then just stare into their eyes.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.440
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Yeah.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.040
Hubba, hubba, hubba, right?

05:23.040 --> 05:24.480
She's elbow deep.

05:25.200 --> 05:25.760
Hubba, hubba.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.920
I watched-

05:27.920 --> 05:29.920
I'm sorry, did you just say hubba, hubba?

05:31.040 --> 05:32.080
Yeah, hubba, hubba.

05:32.080 --> 05:38.720
I watched a girl with a dragon tattoo on a plane to America from Germany and-

05:40.160 --> 05:40.640
Did you cry?

05:42.240 --> 05:42.720
What?

05:42.720 --> 05:43.360
Did you cry?

05:44.560 --> 05:45.440
At the movie?

05:45.440 --> 05:45.680
Yeah.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.440
It's not like a sat-

05:47.440 --> 05:50.800
You know, I said girl with the dragon tattoo, not like the notebook.

05:50.800 --> 05:51.360
No, I know.

05:52.240 --> 05:58.080
Okay, I was watching it and there are some pretty uncomfortable scenes in that movie

05:58.080 --> 06:05.200
and there was one I tried to fast forward through and I tried to fast forward through it

06:05.200 --> 06:08.640
because it was just really, really wrecking my shop and so I fast forwarded through it

06:08.640 --> 06:13.920
but I went way too far in the movie and so I rewound and I rewound back to that scene

06:14.480 --> 06:18.480
and I said, oh fuck, and so I fast forwarded again and I went way too far again

06:18.480 --> 06:24.800
and so I rewound and I rewound right back to that scene again so I did myself-

06:24.800 --> 06:25.920
To a casual observer.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.160
To a casual observer.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.480
I was like, I wanted to live in that scene.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.440
I wanted to build a summer home in that scene and enjoy it.

06:33.440 --> 06:40.400
If there was like a 1 16th slow motion option available on the airplane VCR,

06:40.400 --> 06:44.800
I would have indulged in that scene and just like become a resident there.

06:44.800 --> 06:48.800
But what's more embarrassing, that you did that or that I watched Dark Shadows?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.520
I mean, why would that be bad?

06:51.520 --> 06:52.800
It's a pretty bad movie.

06:52.800 --> 06:58.160
I wasn't deeply impressed with it, but everyone sitting on the plane could watch me

06:58.160 --> 07:02.480
enjoy Johnny Depp's awful performance in that movie and enjoy what I did.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.800
You know what's funny about that, Jarvis?

07:04.800 --> 07:13.840
Last time I flew home from Europe, there was a guy one row up and one to the left of me

07:14.400 --> 07:19.600
who was watching, he was like an old guy and he was watching the Lone Ranger

07:19.600 --> 07:24.800
and like I could tell like he picked it and I knew it was a bad movie

07:24.800 --> 07:30.240
and I felt my heart went out to him because like I had to watch someone watch a bad movie

07:30.240 --> 07:33.840
and just like the whole wave of disappointment, the back and forth that they go through

07:33.840 --> 07:36.320
when you realize like, oh, maybe it's not such a bad movie.

07:36.320 --> 07:41.840
And then later you think, oh, I guess I'm watching this whole thing.

07:41.840 --> 07:49.200
But is that worse than watching someone watch two medieval prostitutes

07:49.200 --> 07:53.920
just wail on each other vis-a-vis their whole fists?

07:53.920 --> 07:55.360
Well, here's the thing.

07:55.360 --> 08:01.440
The magical mystery thing about Travel is like your encounter with these people

08:01.440 --> 08:05.040
is so brief in like the great scheme of things.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.480
Unless it's a trans...

08:06.480 --> 08:11.280
Okay, yeah, maybe considering the fullness of fucking time.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.320
I'm saying think about all the people I was on an airplane with

08:14.320 --> 08:16.240
that watched me cry to dark shadows, right?

08:16.880 --> 08:17.680
And then-

08:17.680 --> 08:20.320
Hey Trav, can we talk about how much you're crying lately?

08:21.760 --> 08:23.200
Because it's like a lot.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.720
Listen, it's a common phenomenon that when you watch the movies on the plane,

08:26.720 --> 08:30.080
I don't know if it's the air pressure or like the oxygen they pump in,

08:30.080 --> 08:33.120
but people tend to have stronger emotional reactions to shit

08:33.120 --> 08:35.120
that they would not feel in real life.

08:35.120 --> 08:39.200
I think if you're watching extended scenes of nudity on a plane, it's creepy.

08:39.200 --> 08:39.680
I think so too.

08:39.680 --> 08:42.640
Personally, I think it's something you should not do.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.680
The other people around you, I mean, even if they're not children,

08:45.680 --> 08:49.520
like they may just like not appreciate that,

08:49.520 --> 08:53.120
or maybe like, I don't know, spoilers, you know?

08:53.840 --> 08:57.840
There should be software embedded on each plane.

08:57.840 --> 09:01.840
I watched Iron Man 3 on a plane and it was like Iron Man 3 plane edition.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.560
By which I mean all the scenes of helicopters exploding

09:04.560 --> 09:07.040
and basically that whole scene where the plane explodes in the sky

09:07.040 --> 09:09.440
and Iron Man has to catch all those people are gone

09:09.440 --> 09:11.280
and the movie is 40 minutes long.

09:11.280 --> 09:15.200
There should be software in the plane that hacks into your iPad

09:15.200 --> 09:22.000
and your Nexus and your global tab and it gets in there

09:22.000 --> 09:25.040
and it can be called Fist Nanny.

09:25.040 --> 09:28.080
And if there's a scene of fisting, it will automatically-

09:28.080 --> 09:29.120
Or Nanny Fist.

09:29.120 --> 09:33.520
Nanny Fist and it will automatically fast forward through that scene

09:33.520 --> 09:36.240
so that you don't upset your neighbors.

09:37.200 --> 09:37.760
How about it?

09:37.760 --> 09:38.800
How about the technology?

09:38.800 --> 09:40.640
How about the technology?

09:40.640 --> 09:48.160
That new Liam Neeson movie is gonna be a weird one to watch on a plane

09:48.160 --> 09:49.120
because they can't-

09:49.120 --> 09:51.360
The thing is, they won't ever be able to reference

09:52.000 --> 09:54.560
that nonstop takes place on a plane.

09:55.200 --> 09:59.040
So it'll just be very curious as to why he's locked in this small room,

09:59.680 --> 10:00.800
why no one will let him out.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.880
This tubular room.

10:02.880 --> 10:03.840
This tubular room.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.120
It's on a new sky train.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.800
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

10:08.800 --> 10:09.200
Please.

10:10.400 --> 10:16.080
This Yahoo was sent in by Kent Siri.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.200
Thanks, Kent.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.840
It's by Yahoo Answers user Katya who asks,

10:21.680 --> 10:24.400
why do some idiots think Toy Story is real?

10:26.320 --> 10:27.200
Yeah, that's right.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.960
Toy Story is a myth, okay?

10:28.960 --> 10:29.760
Additional details.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.600
Just to let you know, I do love Toy Story,

10:31.600 --> 10:34.400
but it's so annoying when people say it's based on real life.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.280
What?

10:37.280 --> 10:37.600
Wait.

10:39.280 --> 10:42.720
I am fucking annoyed at how many people are coming up to me every day.

10:42.720 --> 10:47.680
How often is this scenario recurring in your life?

10:47.680 --> 10:49.600
This happens to me daily, Trav.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.760
People come up to me and they're like,

10:53.120 --> 10:54.960
you know Woody was based on my dad.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.200
I say, was your dad a marionette and also a fictional?

10:59.200 --> 11:01.920
And they just look at me this dark stare, like sort of a blank.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.200
Mm-hmm.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.840
Probably like your face was when you were watching Dark Shadows.

11:05.840 --> 11:06.400
I'm crying.

11:06.400 --> 11:10.480
Sort of like a hollowed out, sort of hurting, deep hurting.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.360
Listen, he just wanted to be loved, you guys,

11:13.360 --> 11:16.400
but like you've been cursed and he was going through a lot of shit.

11:16.400 --> 11:16.640
Sure.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.120
This stuff is deep.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.840
Now wait, when was the last time you saw Toy Story?

11:21.840 --> 11:23.600
Because I do not think curses.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.720
He's talking about Dark Shadows again.

11:26.720 --> 11:30.240
I'm actually talking about my Dark Shadows Toy Story crossover fanfic.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.840
I would imagine that if you really think about Toy Story,

11:34.480 --> 11:39.920
that their sentience is a curse, you know?

11:39.920 --> 11:44.080
Like they become sentient when we're not around.

11:44.960 --> 11:48.560
When we are there, they lose sentience.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.960
They don't, they can't be aware of us really

11:51.520 --> 11:57.280
because their mind and body shut down whenever we're present, right?

11:57.280 --> 11:58.560
They lose sentience.

11:58.560 --> 12:02.400
Now, Justin, I would argue that in fact, they are quite aware of us

12:02.400 --> 12:06.800
because of the issues with Andy that Woody and Buzz are dealing with.

12:08.800 --> 12:17.520
Can you imagine a more horrifying fate than to suddenly be a living corpse,

12:17.520 --> 12:20.960
unable to perambulate or affect the world around you,

12:20.960 --> 12:27.920
but instead having to just soak in whatever inhumanity the gigantic humans can visit on you

12:27.920 --> 12:29.600
and being powerless to stop?

12:29.600 --> 12:31.200
That is what that movie's about.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.720
It's like that show Attack on Titan.

12:33.360 --> 12:34.640
You guys watch that anime?

12:36.320 --> 12:37.840
No, I'm 33.

12:40.080 --> 12:46.240
I think those toys, if they had hung around much longer in Andy's life,

12:47.520 --> 12:53.760
then they basically would have been a bunch of creepy sex watchers, right?

12:53.760 --> 13:00.720
You know, for a fact, 100% not a question,

13:00.720 --> 13:05.520
every character you love from that movie was there the first time Andy masturbated.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.720
Every single one of them.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.200
Every single-

13:07.200 --> 13:08.240
I thought I turned you-

13:08.240 --> 13:10.320
It's weird, I turned all these guys around.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.000
I'm starting to think that they're sentient.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.880
Guys, what did we just see?

13:16.320 --> 13:17.520
Is that a new game?

13:17.520 --> 13:18.240
I don't like it.

13:18.240 --> 13:18.720
Is that a new toy?

13:18.720 --> 13:24.320
He went to infinity and beyond and then a little further than that, I would say.

13:24.320 --> 13:29.120
Does Mattel make a new fleshy Bop-It?

13:29.120 --> 13:32.640
Like, oh, guys, you sweet, sweet angels.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.520
Listen, Andy's got an itch down there, guys, apparently,

13:35.520 --> 13:37.600
and we're the only ones who can help him.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.240
Let's go!

13:40.000 --> 13:42.560
I would watch that movie before I would watch Planes.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.520
Now, toys gather round.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.720
Gather round, I want to introduce you to our new friend.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.000
Andy just bought her.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.280
Her name is Fleshlight.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.480
Come over here, Fleshlight.

13:55.760 --> 13:56.480
Hey, guys.

13:58.240 --> 13:58.800
Kill me.

13:59.520 --> 14:00.800
Kill me, please.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.920
I'll feed some shit.

14:05.680 --> 14:08.000
Because he's got a big rubbery mouth, it's hard for him to talk.

14:08.560 --> 14:09.360
Oh, it's a heat.

14:10.000 --> 14:10.320
Yeah.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.360
Yeah, of course.

14:13.360 --> 14:19.280
That's the way God made me.

14:19.280 --> 14:22.560
Man, of all the wigs for us not to have an Extreme Restraints ad.

14:25.200 --> 14:30.320
Do you have any advice for a 23-year-old female who just started playing Puchamon

14:30.320 --> 14:32.080
Blue for the first time?

14:32.080 --> 14:38.160
I didn't get into it when it was released because I was busy getting beat at Goldeneye.

14:38.160 --> 14:41.360
I named the nemesis formerly known as Gary after my older brother

14:41.360 --> 14:44.800
so I could finally kick his ass at a video game Pocket Monster style.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.560
I have no prior Pokémon experience.

14:48.560 --> 14:49.680
That's from Catch You Later.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.520
Griffin, I'm going to step away.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.440
No, I'm absolutely useless in this department.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.680
Griffin, you don't have any Pokémon advice?

15:01.040 --> 15:04.640
No, but it's like if I went to fucking...

15:07.520 --> 15:09.600
Let me think of a famous athlete real quick.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.520
If I went to Peyton Manning.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.400
Touchdown Nelson.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.520
If I went to Touchdown Nelson.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.880
Refrigerator Steven.

15:14.880 --> 15:18.880
If I went to Refrigerator Steven and was like, teach me how to block in football,

15:18.880 --> 15:19.840
I'd be like, all right.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.800
And then he would start dropping this expert technique on me.

15:25.120 --> 15:28.160
You're saying you can't get your head back down to her level.

15:28.160 --> 15:28.640
That's right.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.920
Is that what you're saying?

15:29.920 --> 15:30.960
I'm so elevated.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.960
There are matrices and I just...

15:36.960 --> 15:37.520
I don't know.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.240
It's complicated.

15:38.240 --> 15:38.960
Get a Pikachu.

15:38.960 --> 15:39.600
That one's pretty good.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.840
Plus, Griffin doesn't give that advice out for free anymore

15:43.840 --> 15:45.840
ever since he started doing his self-help books.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.080
I can help.

15:50.800 --> 15:55.440
So you just get them.

15:55.440 --> 15:59.280
Get them and I think you use the psychic against the earth

15:59.280 --> 16:00.160
and that's pretty good.

16:01.440 --> 16:02.720
The best one is Beedrill.

16:03.680 --> 16:04.720
Beedrill is the best Pokémon.

16:04.720 --> 16:05.120
That's right.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.000
Mathematically, it's the best one.

16:08.000 --> 16:08.720
Yeah.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.600
You got to get male and female so they can do it.

16:12.560 --> 16:12.800
Okay.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.240
That feature's not in Pokémon.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.640
You get more Pokémon from the do it

16:18.640 --> 16:21.280
and then you raise them and you sell them for food.

16:21.280 --> 16:21.440
Yeah.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.880
Or you just turn them into food yourself.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.680
Just eat your Game Boy.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.400
Eat your Game Boy.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.800
I don't think you should eat your Game Boy.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.560
Make sure to leave your Game Boy in the sun

16:32.560 --> 16:34.480
so your Pokémon don't get cold.

16:34.480 --> 16:34.880
That's right.

16:34.880 --> 16:37.440
And so if they're plant type, they can grow.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.600
Bury it in the earth.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.360
Bury it there when they die.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.960
Leave all your Pokémon at the daycare.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.200
Walk around completely unarmed.

16:45.920 --> 16:49.280
Don't forget to leave your Pokémon in your will to somebody.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.920
That is important or they go to the government.

16:51.920 --> 16:55.200
You got to release your Pokémon when they start to get old

16:55.200 --> 16:56.960
because then if you don't, they'll die

16:57.520 --> 16:59.920
and that gets really expensive after a while

17:00.640 --> 17:02.320
handling all those Pokémon funerals.

17:02.320 --> 17:06.080
You're going to have the federales down your neck after a grip.

17:06.080 --> 17:06.720
Just kind of...

17:06.720 --> 17:07.440
Oh, I mean Pokémon...

17:07.440 --> 17:09.600
Don't forget to feed your Pokémon.

17:09.600 --> 17:10.880
Pokémon coffins aren't cheap.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.240
Yeah.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.520
And they're all specially sized.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.800
And they're all very specially sized.

17:14.800 --> 17:15.200
You think you're...

17:15.200 --> 17:18.000
I was watching an episode of Animal Cops Houston.

17:18.000 --> 17:18.320
Yeah.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.240
Where this dude had all these Pokémon

17:20.240 --> 17:21.120
and he wasn't feeding them.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.960
He just had them tied up out back.

17:22.960 --> 17:23.440
Yeah.

17:23.440 --> 17:26.000
And like the cops came in and they collected...

17:26.000 --> 17:29.280
It was 45 Pokémon that they took away from this guy's place.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.360
Well, he wasn't even close to catching them all.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.120
No, no. And it was all the same one.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.000
It was all Beedrills.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.920
That would be the worst one to collect en masse.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.520
He was living in terror.

17:39.520 --> 17:40.560
Yeah, I can imagine.

17:42.880 --> 17:43.600
I would...

17:43.600 --> 17:44.880
I need a Pokémon.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.320
Yeah, sure.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.440
What Pokémon would you guys eat?

17:49.120 --> 17:49.520
Ash.

17:51.280 --> 17:51.840
Wait a minute.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.240
Sorry.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.520
Un momento.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.200
No, I mean, Travis has a great point.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.840
If every creature in that world is a Pokémon,

17:59.840 --> 18:04.880
then we can assume that people are Pokémon.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.240
You look at like a Mr. Mime.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.720
That's just a guy.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.320
That's just a mime.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.480
That's just a man who's a mime.

18:12.480 --> 18:15.440
Just because you are that profession, silly as it may be,

18:15.440 --> 18:18.000
it doesn't give people the right to encapsulate you.

18:18.000 --> 18:18.560
You know what I mean?

18:19.120 --> 18:20.160
Doesn't really seem fair.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.560
In the back of my girlfriend's house,

18:22.560 --> 18:25.680
there's a Mimosa tree that she saved

18:25.680 --> 18:27.520
from being cut down by a private company.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.920
She fought them after they cut down every other tree

18:29.920 --> 18:31.920
in her neighborhood's respective backyards

18:31.920 --> 18:33.840
to put in a parking lot nobody uses,

18:33.840 --> 18:35.200
and saved just this one.

18:35.200 --> 18:39.600
The problem is there's one kid who always comes by

18:39.600 --> 18:42.080
and climbs, kicks, and break the branches off of it.

18:42.960 --> 18:45.440
How do we keep this guy from hurting

18:45.440 --> 18:48.000
the last green shade they've got, Anthony?

18:48.640 --> 18:51.040
Anthony, you can't own a tree.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.120
Next question.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.160
Listen, read the Giving Tree.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.000
The Giving Tree, that tree is stoked.

18:58.000 --> 18:58.240
Yeah.

18:58.880 --> 18:59.360
Okay?

18:59.360 --> 19:01.680
You can't interrupt the cycle of Giving Tree.

19:01.680 --> 19:02.560
Every tree has a boy.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.720
Do you think the Giving Tree is happy to be kicked

19:04.720 --> 19:06.160
at heaven's branches?

19:06.160 --> 19:07.680
What is it giving at that point?

19:07.680 --> 19:08.640
I understand, little man.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.520
Oh, listen.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.480
You need this more than-

19:10.480 --> 19:13.200
Ah, ah, ah, fuck, god damn it.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.040
Okay, yep, nope, yep, nope.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.640
You're right, you're right.

19:16.640 --> 19:17.760
No, you're right.

19:17.760 --> 19:18.480
I deserve that.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.520
I brought it on myself.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.200
Here, have a Mimosa.

19:21.200 --> 19:26.640
Oh, I watched Slavery Times and I didn't do anything.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.000
I earned this.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.960
I could have spoken up.

19:32.960 --> 19:33.200
Yeah.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.840
You can't own a tree.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.320
You gotta let a tree do what a tree-

19:38.320 --> 19:40.240
I mean, you want shade from it.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.640
This kid wants to take out his preteen anger.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.480
Well, first of all, if you're saying,

19:45.120 --> 19:47.040
we need to rescue this tree for shade,

19:47.040 --> 19:51.120
like, build a house, you goober.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.800
Houses are like all-

19:52.800 --> 19:53.840
Are you a bird?

19:53.840 --> 19:56.800
They're all shade all the time, and that's pretty cool.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.640
Why is there a kid that has a fucking vendetta

20:00.640 --> 20:01.760
against your tree?

20:01.760 --> 20:03.360
Because it's the only tree in the neighborhood.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.680
The kid was able to get all the rest of them chopped down.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.760
The kid's a captain of industry, by the way.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.800
We didn't mention that.

20:10.320 --> 20:11.120
Little tycoon.

20:11.120 --> 20:11.840
Here's the thing.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.800
The way that natural selection and evolution works

20:14.800 --> 20:19.680
is that as new enemies develop,

20:19.680 --> 20:21.920
the creatures develop defense mechanisms.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.520
If you protect this tree,

20:23.520 --> 20:27.200
you are robbing us of man-eating trees in 3,000 years.

20:27.200 --> 20:27.440
Yeah.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.360
Wow, that's true, Travis.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.320
That's a circle of life.

20:30.320 --> 20:31.840
Yeah, you gotta let these trees develop

20:31.840 --> 20:33.440
their own natural defenses.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.280
I think the circle of life terminates

20:35.280 --> 20:37.040
once they're man-eating trees,

20:37.040 --> 20:38.160
because we need them.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.000
It is the ultimate catch-22,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.480
because we need them to breathe, don't we?

20:42.480 --> 20:43.760
We can't just kill all of them,

20:43.760 --> 20:44.960
because then we're killing ourselves.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.400
That's true.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.440
Maybe it's harder to breathe

20:47.440 --> 20:48.480
in their neighborhood right now.

20:49.040 --> 20:49.920
Definitely is.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.640
Maybe that's why this kid is losing his goddamn mind.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.320
His kid's not hitting the tree.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.480
He's putting his mouth flush with the tree

20:56.480 --> 20:56.960
and just like,

20:59.920 --> 21:00.240
oh, it's so good.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.440
He's breaking the branches

21:01.440 --> 21:03.200
and sucking the oxygen straight out of it.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.200
Oh, it's so good right off the tap.

21:09.680 --> 21:10.400
Child.

21:10.400 --> 21:10.880
Children.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.200
They're awful.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.720
They are just the worst.

21:14.720 --> 21:15.920
Just terrible.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.440
And I'll, this is, I mean,

21:18.640 --> 21:20.000
the solution is right there.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.760
I didn't want to spoil the answer,

21:21.760 --> 21:23.680
but it's pretty obvious to me

21:23.680 --> 21:25.920
what you should do to keep the kid off the tree.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.120
When the kid climbs the tree,

21:27.120 --> 21:28.000
you climb the kid.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.240
No, you put some jelly on it.

21:30.240 --> 21:30.880
Oh, God.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.800
Put some jelly on the tree,

21:32.800 --> 21:34.720
on the branches and on the trunk.

21:34.720 --> 21:38.400
He goes to like grab the tree or fuck with it,

21:38.960 --> 21:40.320
and he's going to come back

21:40.320 --> 21:42.320
with a fistful of tree jelly.

21:42.320 --> 21:42.960
What is this?

21:42.960 --> 21:43.520
He'll think.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.320
Do you mean sap?

21:44.960 --> 21:45.600
Then okay.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.960
No, tree jelly.

21:46.960 --> 21:47.840
He won't know about sap.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.400
He's too young.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.680
Oh, fair point.

21:49.680 --> 21:50.720
And the tree jelly,

21:50.720 --> 21:51.840
he'll totally get the concept.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.520
He'll be, well, Travis,

21:53.520 --> 21:55.920
he won't have to be Angela Lansbury.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.040
There's jelly on a tree.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.120
I'm not the one who said

21:59.120 --> 22:01.200
he wouldn't understand the concept of sap.

22:02.480 --> 22:03.360
Let me throw this out.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.680
Elaborate tree costume.

22:05.680 --> 22:06.400
Haunt the kid.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.320
Okay, but that's also like gross.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.000
You're going to roll up to his house.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.680
You're going to pound on his door late at night.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.040
He's going to answer and say,

22:15.040 --> 22:17.120
I'm a tree sprite.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.000
And you're going to teach him

22:18.560 --> 22:20.640
about like the beauty of trees.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.880
Travis, please, a spriggan, please.

22:23.840 --> 22:24.480
Okay.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.440
Then at the end of the night,

22:26.560 --> 22:27.060
kill him.

22:30.080 --> 22:30.720
Wait a minute.

22:30.720 --> 22:31.200
No, hold on.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.240
No, that's a perfect crime.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.400
How many kids do you think die

22:34.400 --> 22:36.480
because of tree-related injuries every year?

22:36.480 --> 22:37.920
You can just write that one off.

22:37.920 --> 22:38.880
The detectives come.

22:38.880 --> 22:39.920
They're like, let me see.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.880
Sap, a little bit of tree jelly around the window frame.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.240
Yeah, it looks like another tree.

22:44.240 --> 22:44.960
God damn it.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.160
Got another one.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.120
Well, we need him to live.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.720
So there's nothing really can really do about it.

22:54.320 --> 22:54.820
Trees.

22:55.760 --> 22:58.000
How scary is that scene in Poltergeist, by the way?

22:58.800 --> 23:00.320
When the tree kills the kid?

23:00.320 --> 23:00.880
He doesn't.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.160
I mean, that kid should be dead.

23:02.160 --> 23:03.200
Can we all agree about that?

23:03.920 --> 23:05.680
I always thought that that was sort of bullshit

23:05.680 --> 23:08.640
that they just sort of like pull him out

23:08.640 --> 23:09.520
of the clutches of the tree.

23:09.520 --> 23:10.720
And he's like, no, I'm all right.

23:10.720 --> 23:14.080
That tree looked super scary, super deadly.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.800
It could have killed you like 100 times over, and it didn't.

23:16.800 --> 23:17.840
Nice try, spirits.

23:19.520 --> 23:20.480
Put your back into it.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.240
Kill a kid for once, why don't you?

23:24.240 --> 23:24.960
For once.

23:24.960 --> 23:25.680
You guys want a Yahoo?

23:26.240 --> 23:26.480
Sure.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.280
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport,

23:29.280 --> 23:30.480
an Emerald member.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.200
Thank you, Drew.

23:31.200 --> 23:31.760
It's by Yahoo!

23:31.760 --> 23:33.680
Answer's user Ashley, who asks,

23:33.680 --> 23:36.400
I need new kind of sad songs from the heart

23:36.400 --> 23:37.680
for teens to listen to.

23:37.680 --> 23:38.400
Any ideas?

23:38.400 --> 23:40.160
One more time.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.960
I need new kind of sad songs from the heart

23:42.960 --> 23:44.320
for teens to listen to.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.280
See, I love this, because it's not asking for new songs.

23:47.280 --> 23:49.680
It's asking for a new kind of song.

23:49.680 --> 23:53.680
Like sad dubstep.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.600
Can I get some dark shadows ballads?

23:56.560 --> 23:58.800
What if you listen to Christmas Shoes,

23:58.800 --> 24:01.440
but also at the same time, because that's too sad?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.560
Listen to Shaggy's It Wasn't Me underneath it

24:04.560 --> 24:05.040
at the same time.

24:05.040 --> 24:05.840
It wasn't shoes.

24:05.840 --> 24:08.640
It wasn't shoes.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.240
It wasn't your mom.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.680
It's a song about dying.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.840
Picture this, she was dying from cancer.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.200
And my mommy's got the cancer.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.080
So get some shoes.

24:22.640 --> 24:24.800
She's gonna be walking with Jesus.

24:24.800 --> 24:25.680
So buy the shoes.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.840
I don't have enough money.

24:29.840 --> 24:30.720
Just steal the shoes.

24:30.720 --> 24:35.440
Yeah, daddy, I got her some red shoes.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.000
She uses them to walk on the floor.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.440
Picture this, we were both butt naked.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.120
Why were you both in CPS show, dog?

24:45.840 --> 24:46.720
So buy the shoes.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.920
They got her in attention.

24:49.920 --> 24:50.720
So buy the shoes.

24:52.800 --> 24:53.440
What?

24:53.440 --> 24:57.440
I mean, there were some fucking classic standbys back in the day.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.840
I don't know if anybody's still making music like that,

24:59.840 --> 25:01.200
because I don't think it's sustained.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.200
Is Bone Sustained Harmony still making music?

25:05.040 --> 25:05.600
Not really sad.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.800
That song didn't bum me out.

25:06.800 --> 25:07.680
No, yes.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.760
See You at the Crossroads made me sad every time.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.360
I'm saying See You at the Crossroads is beautiful

25:11.360 --> 25:13.360
because it's kind of sad, but it's also like,

25:14.080 --> 25:15.040
yeah, man, you know what?

25:15.040 --> 25:16.400
I'll see you at the Crossroads.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.680
But I miss my little child, y'all.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.120
That is what it's like.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.560
I miss my little child, y'all.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.680
You know, the song that made me sad all the time,

25:25.680 --> 25:27.200
only kind of sad when I was a teen,

25:27.200 --> 25:30.720
that worked for me, was Time After Time by Miss Cindy Lauper.

25:30.720 --> 25:31.760
Did it really?

25:31.760 --> 25:33.280
Ooh, that one'll get to me.

25:33.280 --> 25:37.120
I preferred the Matchbox 20 version, but that's fine.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.560
Oh, man, that one'll touch me deep down.

25:40.560 --> 25:41.440
That one gets to me.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.200
Is there something in the content of the song

25:43.200 --> 25:47.040
or do you liken it back to like a sad memory?

25:47.040 --> 25:48.080
Sad, it's sad.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.240
Musically, it's sad.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.400
The key, it's in a sad key.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.280
Yeah, what is it?

25:53.280 --> 25:56.880
J, it's in the key of, aw.

25:56.880 --> 25:58.880
I put this in a depressed J.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.240
There's always the cure, I guess.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.800
Yeah, they got some sad jams.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.560
I just don't think any, I don't think,

26:04.560 --> 26:07.040
all the music nowadays is all just like fun

26:07.040 --> 26:09.600
and like, well, fun by the band Fun.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.600
And they don't make sad songs, really.

26:11.600 --> 26:15.120
What did teens, do teens wanna listen to sad music?

26:15.120 --> 26:16.240
I don't, see, that's the thing.

26:16.240 --> 26:18.000
I don't think teens wanna listen to music.

26:18.560 --> 26:22.720
No, teens wanna listen to music and mashups.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.040
And like back in, I feel like getting sad

26:25.040 --> 26:28.160
was like all the music, like Damien Rice came out

26:28.160 --> 26:29.920
and like set the world on a sad fire.

26:30.560 --> 26:34.000
What about, what's that?

26:34.000 --> 26:37.360
Where, where can my baby be?

26:37.360 --> 26:38.720
Yeah, Last Kiss.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.800
Last Kiss, ooh, that's a sad one.

26:40.800 --> 26:45.200
Yeah, that one always bummed me out because it existed.

26:48.720 --> 26:52.880
What about, what about I Can't Make You Love Me

26:52.880 --> 26:53.920
by Miss Bonnie Rice?

26:53.920 --> 26:55.440
Oh, fuck.

26:55.440 --> 26:59.360
Come on, that one'll get you, whoa.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.480
Is Jolene kinda sad?

27:03.360 --> 27:07.120
Jolene is sad, but it's also so good

27:07.120 --> 27:09.760
that it gets you pumped, you know?

27:09.760 --> 27:12.720
What about Love on the Rocks by Sir Neil Diamond?

27:14.080 --> 27:15.600
That's not bad.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.000
The theme song does step by step.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.960
Sometimes I worry that, okay, wait a minute.

27:22.960 --> 27:23.760
Landslide.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.400
Next question, that one's answered.

27:28.960 --> 27:29.760
Tears in Heaven.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.760
Can I tell you guys an honest story about Tears in Heaven?

27:34.800 --> 27:37.200
Is it gonna be you making fun of Tears in Heaven

27:37.200 --> 27:40.720
because like, I don't think that'll play very well.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.160
I'm making fun of myself.

27:42.160 --> 27:47.040
I was, I had a screen that popped out of my butt.

27:47.040 --> 27:51.600
Oh, that was a great story, Justin.

27:52.960 --> 27:54.640
A screen that popped out of my window

27:54.640 --> 27:56.880
and just like the top half came out

27:56.880 --> 27:59.280
and I was trying to get it back in

27:59.280 --> 28:00.400
and I should've just let it be,

28:01.360 --> 28:06.240
but I couldn't, I couldn't let it just be there

28:06.240 --> 28:07.680
because I'm having a child

28:07.680 --> 28:10.080
and I was obsessed with the idea

28:10.080 --> 28:14.000
that my child would, with Tears in Heaven,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.400
and I couldn't let it, I couldn't let it go.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.720
It like, I don't know, it really got to me for some reason.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.080
Like that song got stuck in my head.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.600
I was like, I can't let this happen.

28:21.600 --> 28:22.880
I have to fix this screen.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.800
It's really important, but I just shut the window.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.240
You know what, babies aren't gonna like.

28:26.960 --> 28:29.520
I know, I know, but what if I forgot the screen was broken?

28:30.080 --> 28:31.120
I couldn't handle it.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.200
What if the screen fell on your kid

28:33.200 --> 28:35.120
and then it laid on top of him

28:35.120 --> 28:36.320
and he like wriggled around

28:36.320 --> 28:38.320
and he like cheese grated himself?

28:38.320 --> 28:40.160
Or what if like because of that screen

28:40.160 --> 28:41.920
your kid didn't get into a good college?

28:43.440 --> 28:44.720
I don't wanna think about this anymore.

28:44.720 --> 28:46.400
I really do need to get some money.

28:46.400 --> 28:46.880
Come on.

28:56.880 --> 28:57.840
Get on now.

28:57.840 --> 28:58.560
Get on in there.

28:58.560 --> 28:59.360
Get on now.

28:59.360 --> 29:00.400
Come on, move along now.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.120
We had to raise ourselves some campaign finances.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.440
Jacob's sweet spot.

29:07.440 --> 29:10.080
Wally Parker is a new concept in our way.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.800
Contemporary eyeglasses.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.000
They're extremely affordable

29:14.000 --> 29:15.920
and they're fashioned forward.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.360
You're gonna have to take that from them.

29:18.080 --> 29:19.760
I would not trust me to tell you

29:19.760 --> 29:20.320
it's fashion forward right now.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.480
Just what fashion is in general.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.200
Right now I'm wearing a shirt from Tybee Island

29:25.200 --> 29:27.200
that says island time state of mind.

29:29.440 --> 29:30.640
I cannot be trusted.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.480
We're supported by Warby Parker,

29:34.480 --> 29:38.320
who's a friend of ours with a new concept in glasses.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.400
Most glasses are too expensive

29:42.400 --> 29:43.920
and that makes them terrible

29:43.920 --> 29:45.680
because you can't wear them without being scared

29:45.680 --> 29:47.360
they're gonna break or something.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.720
But Warby Parker,

29:48.720 --> 29:52.720
you get these really hot fashion forward prescription glasses

29:52.720 --> 29:54.480
and they just cost 95 bucks.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.840
Now here's the thing about Warby Parker

29:57.840 --> 29:58.480
that makes them cool.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.960
They have this like home trial program

30:00.960 --> 30:02.400
where you get five pairs of glasses

30:02.400 --> 30:03.200
and they send them to your house.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.120
You pick out five pairs that you're into.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.000
They send them to your house.

30:06.000 --> 30:06.880
You try them all on.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.080
You ask your friends,

30:08.080 --> 30:10.160
what does this make me look like?

30:10.160 --> 30:11.440
Does this make me look smart?

30:11.440 --> 30:12.480
Will Dylan like these?

30:13.120 --> 30:16.080
And then you put the ones you don't want back in a box

30:16.080 --> 30:17.120
and you ship them off to them

30:18.080 --> 30:20.160
and you for free,

30:20.160 --> 30:21.280
it's not even a big deal.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.960
And maybe Dylan won't like them

30:22.960 --> 30:24.080
and then you just do it again.

30:24.640 --> 30:26.080
And then you put Dylan in the box

30:26.080 --> 30:28.160
and you ship Dylan back to Warby Parker

30:28.160 --> 30:28.720
and you say,

30:28.720 --> 30:30.000
okay, Dylan, while you're there,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.160
just pick out something you do like for God's sakes.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.080
Enjoy Warby Parker,

30:34.080 --> 30:35.200
now you have a Dylan.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.200
They have a prescription polarized lenses for 150 bucks

30:41.200 --> 30:42.720
and for every one they sell,

30:42.720 --> 30:45.040
they give a pair of glasses to somebody in need.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.000
That's crazy.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.520
So go to warbyparker.com slash my brother

30:49.520 --> 30:53.120

30:53.760 --> 30:56.880

30:56.880 --> 30:58.400
There were a lot of words in there though.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.000
No, no, no, it was a tongue twister.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.440
Tryin', okay?

31:01.440 --> 31:02.800
I'm out there tryin'.

31:03.760 --> 31:07.360
And you think about that.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.280
You're listening to this on Monday probably.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.320
If you do this right now,

31:10.320 --> 31:11.920
you could have new shades by Friday.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.120
Don't even worry about it

31:13.120 --> 31:14.480
because we hooked you up.

31:15.120 --> 31:18.000
Warbyparker.com slash my brother,

31:18.000 --> 31:19.280
a one word, obviously.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.720
And then as with other things,

31:20.720 --> 31:23.680
if you end up using this because we told you to,

31:23.680 --> 31:24.320
let us know.

31:24.320 --> 31:25.280
Like tweet at us,

31:26.160 --> 31:28.160
send a picture of your new sweet frames.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.080
Yeah, and include Warby Parker in it

31:30.080 --> 31:33.680
because that makes us look like fuckin' big deals.

31:33.680 --> 31:36.160
Okay, so you're dying.

31:36.160 --> 31:36.640
Yep.

31:36.640 --> 31:37.520
Oh, shit.

31:37.520 --> 31:41.200
Sorry, I didn't mean to break it to you guys this way.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.080
You're dying.

31:42.080 --> 31:44.480
And the thing about that is

31:44.480 --> 31:45.440
you don't care what happens

31:45.440 --> 31:46.960
to most of your earthly possessions,

31:46.960 --> 31:49.040
but I have a question for you, friends.

31:49.040 --> 31:52.000
As you slowly or speedily,

31:52.000 --> 31:53.600
there's no way of knowing a sin

31:53.600 --> 31:55.680
towards that golden reward

31:55.680 --> 31:57.920
that meets us on the other side of the beyond.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.440
I ate almost an entire Domino's pizza

31:59.440 --> 32:00.560
by myself yesterday.

32:00.560 --> 32:01.680
Okay, so you're in this kind of-

32:01.680 --> 32:03.280
You could only be dead by dawn.

32:03.280 --> 32:03.920
Choo-choo.

32:04.640 --> 32:06.560
Let's hope Griffin makes it to the end of the episode.

32:06.560 --> 32:08.160
But here's the question, friends,

32:08.160 --> 32:10.240
and I know it's not one we like to confront,

32:10.240 --> 32:12.560
but what happens to your Pokemon when you're gone?

32:12.560 --> 32:14.000
I take them with me.

32:14.000 --> 32:14.720
No, you can't take them-

32:14.720 --> 32:15.760
Like Egyptian style.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.280
I won't be buried with my Pokemon.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.800
I wanna be buried with your Pokemon,

32:18.800 --> 32:20.960
but even if you do wanna be buried with your Pokemon,

32:20.960 --> 32:23.200
you're gonna have to leave some specific instructions

32:23.200 --> 32:25.920
and the only people who can help you do that

32:25.920 --> 32:26.880
is legal zoom.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.240
When I die, let's just talk about this.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.440
Let's just get this over with.

32:31.440 --> 32:34.000
When I die, I want my entire spirit

32:34.000 --> 32:35.520
to be turned into code

32:35.520 --> 32:37.280
and then uploaded into a Pokemon game.

32:38.160 --> 32:38.720
There.

32:38.720 --> 32:39.920
Is that so much to ask?

32:39.920 --> 32:40.400
That's where it is.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.440
Don't burn my body.

32:41.440 --> 32:42.480
Don't scatter my ashes.

32:42.480 --> 32:44.240
Just leave my corpse on the ground.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.600
That's not me anymore.

32:45.600 --> 32:48.080
Legal zoom helps you incorporate or form an LLC

32:48.080 --> 32:50.480
with their simple questionnaire starting at $99.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.960
You have to build a company, right?

32:52.960 --> 32:54.000
If you wanna build a company,

32:54.000 --> 32:55.600
legal zoom can help you out on that.

32:55.600 --> 32:58.800
But more importantly, for our current discussion,

32:58.800 --> 33:01.760
you can create a will starting at just $69

33:02.320 --> 33:04.800
or even a living trust quickly and easily

33:04.800 --> 33:06.320
and get peace of mind and protection.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.080
Now, I know it's uncomfortable

33:08.080 --> 33:09.520
to think about this sort of thing,

33:09.520 --> 33:13.280
but imagine the fun of,

33:13.280 --> 33:15.840
I think it would be worth the 69 bucks

33:15.840 --> 33:19.040
just to have a will in your possession

33:19.040 --> 33:22.400
that dictates what happens to your Pokemon

33:22.400 --> 33:24.080
in the event of your death.

33:24.080 --> 33:24.960
Like you could just have that.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.080
Especially if you make that

33:26.080 --> 33:27.680
and then completely forget about it

33:27.680 --> 33:29.200
and like 50 years from now,

33:29.200 --> 33:31.840
your like loved ones are all bereft

33:31.840 --> 33:32.720
and you're sitting there and like

33:32.720 --> 33:34.080
for the reading of the will

33:34.080 --> 33:35.680
and then it gets to the section on Pokemon

33:35.680 --> 33:37.040
and it's like, God, that asshole.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.280
And they don't know what Pokemon is

33:39.280 --> 33:40.240
cause they're future people.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.200
So they think it's valuable.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.720
So they start a hunt looking for it.

33:43.360 --> 33:44.080
Whoa.

33:44.080 --> 33:44.960
Then they find it

33:44.960 --> 33:46.320
and then they turn on the cartridge

33:46.320 --> 33:47.760
and they're like, oh, this is a pretty fun game.

33:47.760 --> 33:48.960
And then on route six,

33:48.960 --> 33:50.480
they're wandering around in the tall grass

33:50.480 --> 33:52.080
and then a wild Griffin McElroy appears.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.120
It's my spirit.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.200
It's been encoded to the cartridge.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.520
Now, legal zoom is not a law firm,

33:57.520 --> 33:59.920
but they can connect you with a third party attorney

33:59.920 --> 34:01.600
and provide you with self-help services.

34:01.600 --> 34:04.720
And for even more savings,

34:04.720 --> 34:06.240
I know those prices already seem low.

34:06.240 --> 34:07.440
They seem low to me.

34:07.440 --> 34:11.200
I'm 33, but in many ways I'm a child.

34:11.200 --> 34:13.120
So if you'd asked me how much it will cost

34:13.120 --> 34:14.320
before this commercial,

34:14.320 --> 34:17.440
I would have said probably $8 or a million.

34:17.440 --> 34:20.080
So these prices are great,

34:20.080 --> 34:20.880
but for more savings,

34:20.880 --> 34:23.920
you can type my brother into the referral box at checkout.

34:24.480 --> 34:26.240
Don't put this stuff off.

34:26.240 --> 34:27.600
It's not fun to think about,

34:27.600 --> 34:28.960
but just go do it.

34:28.960 --> 34:30.080
Go get your Pokemon sorted out.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.520
Go to legalzoom.com.

34:31.520 --> 34:34.960
Now, and use the coupon code mybrother.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.000
Hey guys, when I die,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.640
would you sprinkle my ashes on Keev or Sutherland

34:38.640 --> 34:39.520
without him knowing it?

34:40.160 --> 34:42.160
While he sleeps a little bit every night.

34:42.160 --> 34:43.360
Just like sneak up behind him

34:43.360 --> 34:45.360
and kind of put a little in his hair.

34:45.360 --> 34:46.080
And he's like, what was that?

34:46.080 --> 34:46.880
And be like, what?

34:46.880 --> 34:48.640
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

34:48.640 --> 34:50.320
My dandruff is really bad lately.

34:50.960 --> 34:51.680
Damn it, Chloe.

34:52.320 --> 34:55.040
This special message is for Midge

34:55.680 --> 34:57.920
and it's from a retired sea captain.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.080
Terrific.

35:00.080 --> 35:02.480
A retired sea captain says,

35:02.480 --> 35:04.640
since that night, I called you a dummy at the green-

35:04.640 --> 35:06.560
Come on, you can get me a voice.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.760
But I mean, what am I going to do like-

35:09.760 --> 35:10.800
Give me a voice.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.560
Give me a damn voice, Griffin.

35:14.720 --> 35:15.920
Since that night,

35:15.920 --> 35:18.800
I called you a dummy at the green mill

35:19.520 --> 35:22.000
and told you something else too.

35:23.440 --> 35:25.920
I knew that nothing was better than you.

35:25.920 --> 35:29.840
Two kittens laughing together.

35:29.840 --> 35:33.920
Griffin describing shoplifting.

35:33.920 --> 35:35.040
I love you.

35:35.040 --> 35:38.320
Retired, not disgraced sea captain.

35:40.720 --> 35:41.280
Since that night,

35:41.280 --> 35:42.560
I called you a dummy at the green mill

35:42.560 --> 35:43.680
and told you something else too.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.200
I knew that nothing was better than you.

35:45.200 --> 35:46.560
Two kittens and laughing together.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.080
Griffin describing shoplifting.

35:48.080 --> 35:48.640
I love you.

35:49.360 --> 35:50.800
You know, your regular voice

35:50.800 --> 35:52.560
does sound a lot like a sea captain.

35:52.560 --> 35:53.040
That's true.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.560
Congratulations on your love, Midge,

35:54.560 --> 35:56.240
and retired sea captain.

35:56.240 --> 35:58.400
Uh, I got a question for you.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.920
Have you ever wondered about the value

35:59.920 --> 36:02.560
of placing an ad on a popular podcast

36:02.560 --> 36:03.520
like My Bim Bam?

36:03.520 --> 36:03.920
Yes.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.840
You want to know if it's right for your business?

36:05.840 --> 36:06.560
Here's a hint.

36:06.560 --> 36:07.120
Probably.

36:07.680 --> 36:08.400
Probably.

36:09.280 --> 36:11.280
Listen to episode 26 of Not A Real Job

36:11.280 --> 36:13.680
to hear how successful their ad was,

36:14.400 --> 36:16.400
and you can subscribe to hear marketing

36:16.400 --> 36:18.080
and writing advice for small business,

36:18.080 --> 36:19.840
artists, entrepreneurs, and more.

36:19.840 --> 36:23.920
Visit notarealjob.com slash M-B-M-B-A-M.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.200
You know, it's fascinating.

36:25.200 --> 36:29.200
They, uh, we had such a big response

36:29.200 --> 36:30.320
to Not A Real Job.

36:30.320 --> 36:30.720
Yeah.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.840
Like, lots of people, uh, listen to that.

36:33.840 --> 36:37.680
It's a podcast about, you know, marketing and advice.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.600
And we had a huge response from people

36:39.600 --> 36:41.760
who listened to it and, like, really enjoyed it.

36:41.760 --> 36:44.000
It was really, I, um, still, I guess,

36:44.000 --> 36:46.080
background, we did an ad for them,

36:46.080 --> 36:47.360
like, three or four episodes ago.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.480
And so they did a whole episode

36:48.480 --> 36:51.360
about the return on that investment.

36:51.920 --> 36:52.800
And I listened to it.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.960
It was really, like, it was super interesting.

36:54.960 --> 36:56.640
Like, I think if you're a fan of podcasts

36:56.640 --> 36:59.440
and, you know, you hear a lot of advertising,

36:59.440 --> 37:00.480
it would be fascinating.

37:00.480 --> 37:03.840
But as a fucking, the person who made that shit,

37:03.840 --> 37:06.800
like, hearing, hearing how it actually works

37:06.800 --> 37:08.720
for the people who advertise on our show,

37:08.720 --> 37:09.680
it was like, I don't know.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.120
It was super, super fascinating.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.800
So yeah, check that, check that out.

37:14.240 --> 37:16.160
I'm Cameron Esposito, and each week

37:16.160 --> 37:20.160
I'm joined by my fellow podcasters, Rhea Butcher.

37:20.160 --> 37:20.960
That's me.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.160
And Ricky Carmona.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.520
I am Ricky Carmona.

37:23.520 --> 37:25.600
We talk about action in sci-fi movies

37:25.600 --> 37:27.440
on a little show called Wham Bam Pow.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.840
You can find it on MaximumFun.org.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.360
It's amazing.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.400
Super fun.

37:32.400 --> 37:32.960
True dat.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.120
Reviews, news, and stuff you can use.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.240
I'm a 20-year-old male in college,

37:44.240 --> 37:48.000
and I want to start wearing prescription-less glasses.

37:48.640 --> 37:49.520
My eyes work fine.

37:49.520 --> 37:52.320
I just know that if I wear a pair that suit me,

37:52.320 --> 37:54.720
I can look pretty damn good.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.520
Sadly, my girlfriend thinks that this is the,

37:58.160 --> 38:01.200
quote, douchiest idea I have ever had.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.600
If I plan to wear them, just what I need

38:03.600 --> 38:05.200
to look a little more suave and smart,

38:05.200 --> 38:09.280
exam, party, et cetera, is this socially and morally sound,

38:09.280 --> 38:11.760
or should I just be thankful for the 2020,

38:11.760 --> 38:14.080
this is from Born to Be, bespectacled.

38:14.080 --> 38:18.240
Listen, we've all, all of us with great vision,

38:18.240 --> 38:19.840
with great vision like myself,

38:20.560 --> 38:25.840
I have willed the fates to dim these perfect jellies

38:25.840 --> 38:32.320
so many times, just so I can have some cool-looking glasses.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.040
And you know what, friends?

38:35.040 --> 38:38.000
It just, maybe it's because I wear Gunner shades.

38:38.000 --> 38:38.480
Protect me from the-

38:38.480 --> 38:39.440
Gunner optics.

38:39.440 --> 38:41.920
Protecting your gamer from gamer rays.

38:42.880 --> 38:43.680
Maybe it's that.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.240
I don't know, but I have wanted this,

38:46.240 --> 38:49.760
and there's just no way of doing it.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.680
Let me break it down as to why I think

38:51.680 --> 38:53.840
it is usually referred to as douchey.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.240
You didn't put in the time.

38:57.040 --> 38:57.920
I put in the time.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.160
I've been wearing the glasses since second grade.

39:00.160 --> 39:01.680
Yeah, they're cool fucking now.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.600
You know when they weren't cool?

39:03.600 --> 39:05.120
But any time before now.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.360
It's like, what I don't want to see

39:07.360 --> 39:08.800
is like 50 years from now,

39:08.800 --> 39:12.960
like the new look is like those corrective,

39:12.960 --> 39:14.000
like leg braces.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.160
And people will perfectly fine legs

39:16.160 --> 39:18.000
are wearing them like you assholes.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.880
No, that's a great comparison.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.800
Can I have designer crutches?

39:22.800 --> 39:24.960
Because I think it'll make me seem erudite.

39:25.760 --> 39:28.640
Can I carry around a designer colostomy bag

39:28.640 --> 39:29.920
that's non-functioning?

39:29.920 --> 39:31.520
Glasses are face crutches.

39:31.520 --> 39:31.760
Yeah.

39:32.480 --> 39:34.240
You're mocking the handicap.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.200
Think about that.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.520
And the thing is, you can then take them off

39:37.520 --> 39:39.120
and not have to wear them anymore.

39:39.120 --> 39:39.840
I cannot.

39:40.720 --> 39:43.440
If I do that, I can no longer drive.

39:43.440 --> 39:44.480
It's like blackface.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.760
It's glasses face.

39:45.760 --> 39:46.960
It's where you're at right now.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.240
You've got shiny face.

39:48.240 --> 39:50.720
It's super, super not like blackface,

39:50.720 --> 39:51.440
like basically yellow.

39:51.440 --> 39:52.720
No, it's exactly like blackface.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.480
It's basically blackface.

39:54.480 --> 39:57.440
It's basically, in short, like just exactly like blackface.

39:57.440 --> 40:00.960
With all the socioeconomic repercussions

40:00.960 --> 40:04.560
of that parallel, it is exactly the same thing.

40:04.560 --> 40:04.800
Okay.

40:06.000 --> 40:06.640
Super not.

40:06.640 --> 40:09.360
But basically is exactly the same.

40:09.360 --> 40:11.520
I wished for glasses too,

40:11.520 --> 40:14.320
because I think it would help me to pull my look together.

40:14.320 --> 40:17.280
But try to think two steps ahead.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.440
This is my thing for 20 forward.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.680
I think that people should be,

40:21.680 --> 40:24.000
I think it's important to think forward too.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.520
Don't just think about the now.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.240
Think two steps ahead when someone asks you,

40:28.240 --> 40:29.840
oh, you wear glasses too.

40:30.480 --> 40:31.760
Why do you wear glasses?

40:31.760 --> 40:34.160
And then I know that doesn't seem like

40:34.160 --> 40:36.000
a super likely conversation starter,

40:36.000 --> 40:36.800
but you never know.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.600
As a glasses wearer, the occurrence of someone saying,

40:39.600 --> 40:40.800
how strong are your glasses?

40:40.800 --> 40:42.080
Here, let me try them on.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.400
It's like, it's pretty damn common.

40:45.200 --> 40:48.400
Do you guys know that ever since I was very young,

40:48.400 --> 40:51.680
I have always harbored a secret suspicion

40:51.680 --> 40:55.440
that sometime I would try on someone else's glasses.

40:55.440 --> 40:56.160
Oh, that's the dream.

40:56.800 --> 40:57.760
And my, right?

40:57.760 --> 40:58.000
That's the dream.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.920
And my vision would suddenly be like better than it is now.

41:01.920 --> 41:02.960
Can I tell you though?

41:02.960 --> 41:03.360
Perfect.

41:03.360 --> 41:04.160
Can I tell you?

41:04.160 --> 41:05.840
That is actually what happened to me.

41:05.840 --> 41:08.080
I was like, yeah, let me see your glasses.

41:08.080 --> 41:08.880
Let me try those on.

41:08.880 --> 41:09.440
And I tried them on.

41:09.440 --> 41:11.520
I was like, holy fuck, I can see through walls.

41:11.520 --> 41:13.520
Is this what it was supposed to be the whole time?

41:13.520 --> 41:14.560
And I went and got a vision test.

41:14.560 --> 41:17.200
They're like, yeah, dog, your shit is jacked.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.960
You have like no cones in there.

41:19.600 --> 41:20.160
And so I-

41:20.160 --> 41:20.960
It's all wrong.

41:20.960 --> 41:21.840
It's all wrong.

41:21.840 --> 41:22.640
What's going on?

41:24.480 --> 41:26.480
I have dog eyes basically.

41:26.480 --> 41:29.920
And so I got glasses and now they're back to normal.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.440
Do you guys wear contacts?

41:31.440 --> 41:31.840
Fuck no.

41:31.840 --> 41:32.240
Sometimes.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.640
Griffin, could you even do that?

41:34.640 --> 41:35.760
Touch my eyeball?

41:35.760 --> 41:36.000
Nope.

41:36.880 --> 41:37.600
Like every day?

41:37.600 --> 41:39.280
Yeah, I couldn't.

41:39.280 --> 41:43.280
When I was a child and I took the vision test to determine if I needed glasses,

41:43.280 --> 41:47.120
I wanted glasses so bad that for like the next six years,

41:47.120 --> 41:51.200
I was so worried that I skewed the test just at like,

41:51.200 --> 41:52.560
I was like, do I really need these?

41:52.560 --> 41:53.120
Or did I?

41:53.120 --> 41:55.120
And then like, I realized like, oh no, I do.

41:55.120 --> 41:58.480
Cause I'm blind without them because I can't see shit without them.

41:58.480 --> 42:03.280
Now, one thing you could do is you could start wearing prescription glasses

42:03.280 --> 42:06.960
because I heard that Elton John started wearing prescription

42:06.960 --> 42:12.320
glasses to look like Buddy Holly and eventually he needed them to see.

42:12.320 --> 42:15.360
Like his eyes adjusted so that he needed them.

42:15.360 --> 42:15.840
Yeah.

42:15.840 --> 42:16.800
So I guess what I'm saying is-

42:16.800 --> 42:18.880
I would call that putting in the time.

42:18.880 --> 42:19.200
Yeah.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.120
You commit to it, to messing up your eyes permanently.

42:21.120 --> 42:23.040
Or just like throw some acid in your eyes.

42:24.080 --> 42:24.320
Yeah.

42:24.320 --> 42:25.120
Like a joker?

42:25.120 --> 42:26.400
Don't do that.

42:26.400 --> 42:27.040
Don't do that.

42:27.840 --> 42:28.320
One eye.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.040
One eyeball.

42:29.040 --> 42:29.520
One eye.

42:29.520 --> 42:30.080
Yeah, that's fine.

42:30.800 --> 42:34.560
And then you can wear a monocle and that's like four times as cool as glasses.

42:34.560 --> 42:43.440
Um, I, um, can you wear cosmetic contact lenses?

42:45.040 --> 42:48.080
Can you wear like non-prescription contact lenses?

42:48.080 --> 42:49.520
Only if they're clear.

42:50.160 --> 42:50.320
Yeah.

42:50.320 --> 42:50.720
No, no, no.

42:50.720 --> 42:56.960
I'm not talking about like fucking now my, now my eyeballs look like playing card spades.

42:56.960 --> 43:00.320
Like, no, it just, just regular old contact lenses.

43:00.320 --> 43:03.520
So now I'm not allowed to wear my spade contacts anymore?

43:03.520 --> 43:08.000
No, you can wear David Spade contacts that make your eyes look like David Spade's eyes,

43:08.000 --> 43:11.440
which are the most beautiful eyes God ever created.

43:11.440 --> 43:14.640
I have contacts that actually make my eyes look like little David Spades.

43:14.640 --> 43:15.600
Little David Spades.

43:15.600 --> 43:16.560
They're so sad.

43:16.560 --> 43:17.280
It's haunting.

43:18.240 --> 43:20.080
They're like the time after time of eyes.

43:21.360 --> 43:24.320
My dear friend has asked me to officiate his upcoming wedding.

43:24.320 --> 43:29.040
However, I'm not exactly qualified and pretty sure he only asked me due to a conflict with

43:29.040 --> 43:30.880
the brother for the position of best man.

43:30.880 --> 43:35.680
Anyway, God ordained for like eight bucks, but I still have no idea what I'm doing.

43:35.680 --> 43:40.240
What should I do during this most sacred ceremony with a captive audience full of loved ones

43:40.240 --> 43:42.160
as from makeshift minister?

43:42.160 --> 43:43.600
You know who crushed this?

43:43.600 --> 43:44.160
Our papa.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.480
Our papa, Clint McElroy.

43:46.480 --> 43:50.240
Married me away, gave me away, did it without crying too.

43:50.240 --> 43:54.880
I thought that fool was going to blubber like Danny Glover.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.080
No, he kept his shit together.

43:56.080 --> 43:57.760
He kept it on lock.

43:57.760 --> 44:02.240
In fact, I was actually a little disappointed by his total stone face lack of emotion.

44:02.800 --> 44:04.640
He was crying down the back of his throat.

44:04.640 --> 44:06.560
He was inwardly crying.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.280
You know, it was great.

44:07.280 --> 44:12.240
He actually was he had to sit in the corner after the ceremony for 30 minutes and just

44:12.240 --> 44:15.760
cry to get it all because he'd stored it up and it was like drowning.

44:15.760 --> 44:16.880
It was a hard cry.

44:18.240 --> 44:20.160
It was an unattractive leap.

44:20.160 --> 44:24.800
I tell you, the thing that dad did that I was really impressed by that I think is he

44:24.800 --> 44:26.240
did a little bit of scat in the middle.

44:26.240 --> 44:28.880
Well, he farted pleasantly.

44:29.760 --> 44:30.160
What?

44:30.160 --> 44:31.840
No, they said it couldn't be done.

44:35.200 --> 44:37.920
He didn't make it about himself.

44:37.920 --> 44:43.280
He made it about like he gave them a ceremony that would make them happy.

44:43.280 --> 44:47.040
And I think when you have a captive audience like that, I know this would be hard for me

44:47.680 --> 44:51.680
is like to make the ceremony like the Justin McElroy show.

44:51.680 --> 44:54.480
Like, hey, you're going to listen to me talk for 15 or 20 minutes.

44:54.480 --> 44:57.440
Like strap in because I love this attention.

44:57.440 --> 44:57.840
I need it.

44:58.880 --> 45:03.360
You know, I tell you what, our officiant, Jeremy Dubin, like we had a couple of meetings

45:03.360 --> 45:07.120
with him where we just sat down and he was like, so what you know, what kind of ceremony

45:07.120 --> 45:07.680
do you want?

45:08.320 --> 45:10.800
And like we said, well, we'd like to have this kind of thing.

45:10.800 --> 45:13.600
And we've seen this at a wedding before and we'd like to try that.

45:13.600 --> 45:18.960
And he was like a little bit of scat in the middle, but it was like, you know, that way

45:18.960 --> 45:22.000
we got a pretty customized wedding ceremony.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.600
That was exactly what we wanted.

45:23.600 --> 45:24.160
You know what I mean?

45:24.160 --> 45:26.320
Instead of like, I'll surprise you.

45:26.880 --> 45:29.120
Yeah, I think actually that's great advice, Trav.

45:29.120 --> 45:35.040
The best thing you could do, I think, is talk, start talking now to the bride and groom about

45:35.040 --> 45:38.640
sort of what sort of ceremony would make them the happiest.

45:38.640 --> 45:43.040
Because if you can serve them, not only will that make them really happy, but the ceremony

45:43.040 --> 45:48.000
is going to feel like them, which I think for both of you guys, like that was one of

45:48.000 --> 45:52.240
the things that I really liked about both of your weddings is they felt like you.

45:52.240 --> 45:55.920
Like they it didn't feel like a ceremony made for somebody else.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.800
They felt very specific to you guys.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.440
I know it sounds like I'm trying not to cry, but I'm actually trying not to burp.

46:01.440 --> 46:09.120
So if all else fails, you could do like some 90s stand up comedy.

46:09.760 --> 46:10.000
Yeah.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.800
What is the deal with food at weddings?

46:14.080 --> 46:15.360
It's good because it's wedding.

46:15.360 --> 46:17.200
Make sure you get super Jesusy too.

46:18.800 --> 46:19.840
Lean really, really.

46:19.840 --> 46:20.720
You're going to feel.

46:20.720 --> 46:23.280
Revelation shit, not like a.

46:23.280 --> 46:27.680
No, get deep down in revelations, bust out like a Versa to a Leviticus.

46:28.800 --> 46:32.880
You're going to feel an urge to not do that because they're going to tell you explicitly

46:32.880 --> 46:33.760
not to do that.

46:34.320 --> 46:35.520
You just got to push through.

46:36.240 --> 46:39.120
Just got to push through their demands and requests.

46:39.120 --> 46:42.400
Also just know that wedding guests love it when you run long.

46:42.400 --> 46:42.960
Love it.

46:42.960 --> 46:43.280
Love it.

46:43.280 --> 46:43.760
Love it.

46:43.760 --> 46:44.400
Love it.

46:44.400 --> 46:45.360
They love it.

46:45.360 --> 46:48.800
If you get on a free will and jazz oddesty, just talk about the Jesus.

46:48.800 --> 46:49.760
Talking about Jesus.

46:49.760 --> 46:51.840
Maybe do a quick invitational.

46:51.840 --> 46:58.640
Nothing like you don't want it to be like more about Jesus than the people who are getting

46:58.640 --> 46:58.960
married.

46:58.960 --> 47:03.280
But if you want to do just a quick invitational and see if anybody's going to step out of the

47:03.280 --> 47:04.800
way, feel free to ask.

47:04.800 --> 47:05.520
You know what I mean?

47:05.520 --> 47:08.960
If they're in your way, if they're slowing down your role, just ask the bride and groom

47:08.960 --> 47:12.000
to kind of step to the side while you scat a little bit.

47:12.000 --> 47:17.360
And the best place to do your scat invitational is right after they've exchanged rings and

47:17.360 --> 47:21.120
vows, but right before you say, I now pronounce you man and wife.

47:22.640 --> 47:24.400
Just to really give it that drop at the end.

47:24.400 --> 47:28.880
Just like one last trial that everybody has to go through and then we can go drink.

47:29.760 --> 47:34.560
It would also be great if you could arrange something like have a plant in the audience

47:34.560 --> 47:37.200
that you've like built a skit into.

47:37.200 --> 47:37.680
That's fun.

47:37.680 --> 47:38.960
Oh, a fun skit.

47:38.960 --> 47:39.440
Yeah.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.880
Everybody loves skits.

47:40.880 --> 47:43.280
Mid ceremony, do an entire Easter pageant.

47:43.280 --> 47:47.920
That's something you can do complete with crucifixion scene.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.800
And then wait three days.

47:50.800 --> 47:52.240
And now I pronounce you man and wife.

47:52.240 --> 47:57.120
My wife before, in a weird coincidence, my wife before we got married actually came to

47:57.120 --> 48:04.080
our church a couple of times and she was, she's a Catholic.

48:04.080 --> 48:08.400
When she found out about the invitational, when she witnessed that firsthand, she was

48:08.960 --> 48:09.600
horrified.

48:09.600 --> 48:10.080
Yeah.

48:10.080 --> 48:14.640
Because suddenly there's a, it's confusing when you go to a Catholic church because there's

48:14.640 --> 48:19.920
a lot of, there's a lot of moves and choreography that everybody else seems to know that you

48:19.920 --> 48:20.640
don't know.

48:20.640 --> 48:26.160
So it could be a little, you can feel a little lost at, and I would sort of resented that

48:26.160 --> 48:28.240
like, well, it's so easy at my church.

48:28.240 --> 48:29.440
You just kind of hang.

48:29.440 --> 48:31.840
But Sydney pointed out to me and it's a very good point.

48:31.840 --> 48:36.480
At our church, there was a moment where if you stood up at the wrong time, your whole

48:36.480 --> 48:37.280
life is over.

48:37.280 --> 48:41.840
There's a moment where if you stood up at the wrong time, you have to like rededicate

48:41.840 --> 48:44.480
your life to Jesus or join the church or something.

48:44.480 --> 48:48.080
Not only that, my favorite thing about the invitational is when sometimes you didn't

48:48.080 --> 48:50.240
get a response from anyone.

48:50.240 --> 48:52.000
So they would just kind of keep the music going.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.360
Keep it going, keep it going, keep going.

48:53.360 --> 48:53.920
And then like.

48:53.920 --> 48:56.000
I feel like there's someone out there who's ready to commit.

48:56.720 --> 49:03.280
What's always great is there would always be a guy, especially if like, when you had

49:03.280 --> 49:11.040
more like Pentecostal type people, you know, more of that like very enthusiastic.

49:11.040 --> 49:12.480
Snake eaters.

49:12.480 --> 49:13.120
Snake eaters.

49:13.120 --> 49:14.720
No, there's a word I'm looking for.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.360
Not enthusiastic, but.

49:17.360 --> 49:17.920
Ecclesiastic.

49:17.920 --> 49:19.440
Anyway, ecclesiastic.

49:19.440 --> 49:20.000
I don't know.

49:20.000 --> 49:25.120
But you would have people who would stretch it out like youth camps and stuff, and they

49:25.120 --> 49:30.720
would always say something like, listen, I know that this has been going on for a while,

49:30.720 --> 49:34.320
but I just feel the Holy Spirit is telling me that somebody.

49:34.320 --> 49:34.880
Write it out.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.640
Somebody else needs to come up here and get right with the Lord.

49:38.640 --> 49:41.280
Like the Spirit's telling me that.

49:41.280 --> 49:44.480
And then inevitably, no one else would come up.

49:44.480 --> 49:49.120
And which begs the question for me and began sowing some rather unpleasant seeds of doubt.

49:49.680 --> 49:52.720
So was the Holy Spirit just like, ah, my bad.

49:52.720 --> 49:54.880
I'm telling you, it's like Travis at a casino.

49:54.880 --> 49:56.880
Like, no, no, no, no, no, I got this.

49:57.440 --> 49:58.400
Here come the turn.

49:58.400 --> 50:01.680
All right, all right, all right, all right.

50:01.680 --> 50:08.320
That was the best, the dismount from that stance of like, well, all right then.

50:08.320 --> 50:09.280
See y'all next Sunday.

50:09.280 --> 50:10.720
Oh, have a safe drive home.

50:11.600 --> 50:12.000
Okay.

50:12.000 --> 50:12.640
All right, cool.

50:12.640 --> 50:14.080
Anyway, do all that during the wedding.

50:14.080 --> 50:14.640
Gonna be a hit.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.880
Gonna be a great wedding.

50:18.560 --> 50:19.680
We're gonna hit like a record.

50:19.680 --> 50:24.240
We're actually gonna go through all of our questions on our questions list for this episode.

50:24.240 --> 50:28.160
People can't get mad at us anymore about not doing enough questions because we're doing

50:28.160 --> 50:28.800
more questions.

50:29.360 --> 50:29.920
So go sign up.

50:29.920 --> 50:31.200
So keep it in your face.

50:32.080 --> 50:34.320
I have difficulty talking about my feelings.

50:34.880 --> 50:39.520
My girlfriend is not happy about this, particularly in that sometimes she's angry about it.

50:39.520 --> 50:40.960
And I don't blame her.

50:40.960 --> 50:44.800
One of my big hangups is trying to explain my feelings with accuracy and exactness.

50:44.800 --> 50:48.720
And with feelings being what they are, I end up at a loss for words.

50:48.720 --> 50:51.040
Brothers, how do I do a better job of expressing how I feel?

50:51.040 --> 50:52.000
That's from Gmail.

50:52.000 --> 50:52.720
Flashcards.

50:53.600 --> 50:57.280
Boy, three former Baptists, you have come to the right place.

50:57.280 --> 51:02.240
See, you say that, but I have no problem expressing my feelings at any given time at the drop

51:02.240 --> 51:02.640
of a hat.

51:02.640 --> 51:03.600
I'll just do it.

51:03.600 --> 51:04.720
Because for me, it's entirely physiological.

51:04.720 --> 51:07.200
I mean, I cry often and freely.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.640
Yeah, but I mean, that's a disorder.

51:08.640 --> 51:12.560
That's not really an expression of your feelings because you could be crying and be like pretty

51:12.560 --> 51:13.360
psyched.

51:13.360 --> 51:15.680
Yeah, I have what the doctors call full eyes.

51:17.840 --> 51:23.600
My problem a lot of times, and I've only learned this as I've gotten older, is that a lot of

51:23.600 --> 51:24.880
times I don't know how I feel.

51:24.880 --> 51:31.600
Like I don't, until I talk about it and like say the wrong thing several times, like trying

51:31.600 --> 51:33.280
to get, it's like a mystery.

51:33.280 --> 51:40.400
I'll be, I'll know something's up, but I won't know what it is that I'm feeling.

51:40.400 --> 51:42.000
I'm not in touch with those feelings.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.240
And that could be part of your problem that you're just not, unless you're talking about

51:46.240 --> 51:48.880
it with somebody and like trying to work through it.

51:48.880 --> 51:52.240
A lot of times I don't know exactly what I'm feeling.

51:52.240 --> 51:56.160
For the longest time, whenever like people talked about having trouble expressing their

51:56.160 --> 52:01.600
emotions, I really thought that what they were saying was like, they would feel sadness

52:01.600 --> 52:03.120
and then somebody like, hey, are you okay?

52:03.120 --> 52:04.160
And they would just go, yep.

52:05.360 --> 52:09.760
And now I'm starting to suspect that really what's going on is like, because you're so,

52:10.400 --> 52:12.560
I don't know if it's caught up in it or denying it.

52:12.560 --> 52:18.400
Like you don't realize a lot of like, since I've been with Teresa, I've gotten better

52:18.400 --> 52:23.440
at expressing emotions because instead of just like swallowing down or not acknowledging

52:23.440 --> 52:27.600
it, like as we'll talk about it, I'll say out loud, like, I want you to know that I

52:27.600 --> 52:28.880
am feeling angry right now.

52:28.880 --> 52:34.240
And this is why, you know, so I don't think it has to be emotional in your sharing of

52:34.240 --> 52:34.800
your emotions.

52:34.800 --> 52:38.800
Sometimes it's just being honest and just saying like right now in this moment, I am

52:38.800 --> 52:42.480
annoyed because of this or like, Hey, I just want you to know I'm really enjoying this

52:42.480 --> 52:43.760
moment, you know?

52:43.760 --> 52:45.200
And oh yeah.

52:45.200 --> 52:46.160
Say it like that too.

52:46.160 --> 52:48.480
That's good because I'll give her that not quite human vibe.

52:49.200 --> 52:53.840
I'm just saying as a start, like you don't want to like jump in feet first into like

52:53.840 --> 52:54.800
sad town.

52:54.800 --> 52:57.840
And no, I'm just, I, for me, it's not that easy.

52:57.840 --> 53:01.520
Like I don't like a lot of times I don't know.

53:01.520 --> 53:03.600
Like I'll be short with somebody, right?

53:03.600 --> 53:08.720
Or I'll be, I know I'm not having as much pleasure as I normally do.

53:08.720 --> 53:10.000
And I don't know why.

53:10.560 --> 53:15.120
And for me, that can be hard because I don't want to say I'll end up saying stuff that

53:15.120 --> 53:18.880
I don't actually feel just like trying to get to something that feels.

53:18.880 --> 53:19.760
I want pleasure.

53:20.720 --> 53:21.280
Pleasure.

53:21.280 --> 53:22.080
I need pleasure.

53:22.080 --> 53:22.880
Pleasure.

53:23.440 --> 53:24.160
Pleasure.

53:25.520 --> 53:31.600
You know, but I don't think I, all I'm saying is that in any kind of communication that

53:31.600 --> 53:37.520
you are inexperienced with, you got to start off, you know, small and practice it.

53:37.520 --> 53:42.000
You don't want to just like jump into being the dude who is constantly like.

53:42.720 --> 53:43.040
Crying.

53:43.040 --> 53:44.800
Got to work out to having full eyes.

53:44.800 --> 53:46.880
You can't just cry all the time or it's weird.

53:46.880 --> 53:51.200
You got to work up to it until everyone just accepts that you're that dude who's moved

53:51.200 --> 53:54.000
by particularly strong episodes of Family Matters.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.760
The other, the other thing is you got to be careful about when you're, if you're not

53:57.760 --> 54:05.200
sure like what your feelings are, you got to be careful to figure that stuff out before

54:05.200 --> 54:11.040
you start talking about, start talking to the person who may have created those feelings.

54:11.040 --> 54:15.840
Like if I try to work through my feelings with my wife, she knows that I'm a dummy and

54:15.840 --> 54:22.160
she'll try to covertly, subliminally slip in when I might be upset about like, I don't

54:22.160 --> 54:24.880
know, sweetheart, you've been really frustrated.

54:24.880 --> 54:28.960
Maybe you're angry at yourself for never closing the cabinets ever.

54:28.960 --> 54:32.560
And maybe you should do that from time to time and just see how that goes.

54:32.560 --> 54:33.120
So that's.

54:33.120 --> 54:35.840
How much of your anger is cabinet based?

54:35.840 --> 54:41.440
How much of your anger is centered on cabinets and leaving them open all the time and never

54:41.440 --> 54:42.400
closing them?

54:42.400 --> 54:43.360
Do you guys ever do that?

54:43.360 --> 54:44.240
Cause I do it.

54:44.240 --> 54:45.120
No, I'm an adult.

54:45.840 --> 54:46.880
Yeah, I'm supposed to be an adult.

54:46.880 --> 54:47.040
Yeah.

54:47.040 --> 54:50.000
I don't like it when like bugs get on my place cause I eat on those.

54:52.160 --> 54:56.320
I mostly, I just take a lot of naps.

55:00.320 --> 55:03.200
Naps are like train stops for your emotions.

55:03.200 --> 55:04.720
They need time to get on and off.

55:04.720 --> 55:11.920
When it gets a little bit too real, a little bit too hyphy in my life, my lifey, I'll just

55:11.920 --> 55:13.600
take a quicker, quick nap-a-roo.

55:14.800 --> 55:16.080
Cause like, you know what?

55:16.080 --> 55:22.480
It worked when I was four and I'm 26 now and it still works pretty goddamn well.

55:22.480 --> 55:26.160
And I wake up and my wife is like, how are you doing?

55:26.160 --> 55:27.440
And the answer is always great.

55:28.880 --> 55:29.120
I guess.

55:29.120 --> 55:31.920
You know, my wife has just taught me, I had no idea.

55:31.920 --> 55:34.960
Like so much of my emotions are hunger based.

55:36.400 --> 55:37.440
Like I had no idea.

55:37.440 --> 55:40.800
Like we, I think we were, when we were in Louisville, like we stopped for lunch.

55:40.800 --> 55:43.600
It was like a really late lunch at like three o'clock and I'm eating a sandwich.

55:43.600 --> 55:45.200
She was like, do you feel better?

55:45.200 --> 55:45.840
I was like, yeah.

55:45.840 --> 55:46.240
What?

55:46.240 --> 55:47.120
Wait, why?

55:47.120 --> 55:49.440
She's like, well, you've just been kind of frustrated for the last two hours.

55:49.440 --> 55:51.760
I was like, oh no, that's just cause we couldn't find the place.

55:51.760 --> 55:53.280
She's like, no, it's cause you're hungry.

55:53.280 --> 55:54.240
It's like, oh, you're right.

55:54.240 --> 55:54.800
You got me.

55:54.800 --> 55:55.840
Just needed sandwich.

55:57.360 --> 55:59.200
We needed a dose of vitamin sandwich.

55:59.200 --> 56:02.560
We are a bunch of fucking eat beasts.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.000
Yeah.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.600
We're a bunch of monsters.

56:05.600 --> 56:10.320
I don't have like, I really do think I don't have that many complex emotions.

56:11.440 --> 56:15.920
I don't want to sound like I'm like a free spirit or whatever over here, but like,

56:17.120 --> 56:21.360
I never feel like I have emotions that are too complex to describe.

56:21.360 --> 56:24.160
It usually really is like, how are you Griffin?

56:24.160 --> 56:24.560
I don't know.

56:24.560 --> 56:25.120
Kind of bored.

56:25.760 --> 56:28.800
Like, I'm not joking.

56:28.800 --> 56:32.080
Like, I'm not like, I just been thinking about death a lot lately.

56:32.080 --> 56:34.400
It's really mostly like, I don't know.

56:34.400 --> 56:36.960
The cat woke me up last night, so I'm a little bit sleepy.

56:36.960 --> 56:38.480
Well, that could be the problem Griffin.

56:39.120 --> 56:40.640
I think about death a lot.

56:40.640 --> 56:41.760
You should think about death instead.

56:41.760 --> 56:42.000
Okay.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.680
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

56:43.680 --> 56:44.400
Let me give it a shot.

56:46.960 --> 56:47.920
Oh my God.

56:48.960 --> 56:52.560
Oh no, it's all going to stop one day.

56:53.360 --> 56:55.440
It's all just going to stop one day.

56:55.440 --> 56:59.040
Oh no, no, no, no.

57:00.640 --> 57:02.000
That's what your 30s are like.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.680
I'm not going to be here one day.

57:03.680 --> 57:05.040
It's just going to stop.

57:08.480 --> 57:09.280
I need a nap.

57:09.280 --> 57:12.800
That could be a good thing to do during a wedding ceremony.

57:14.240 --> 57:16.480
You too, I've known you your whole lives.

57:16.480 --> 57:17.840
You're so perfect for each other.

57:17.840 --> 57:20.400
It's all going to stop one day.

57:20.400 --> 57:22.640
No, no, no.

57:23.440 --> 57:24.800
Griffin, you're joking.

57:24.800 --> 57:30.240
Do you know how many times I've had that exact, like, mid episode?

57:31.760 --> 57:34.480
We talk about like ghost horses and shit.

57:34.480 --> 57:38.880
I'm like, yeah, and another thing about, oh God, it won't stop.

57:38.880 --> 57:42.000
I actually had that conversation with someone last night.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.280
It's all going to stop.

57:43.280 --> 57:44.960
Think about it.

57:44.960 --> 57:46.800
Cake boss, right guys?

57:46.800 --> 57:48.720
Goofs and goofs and goofs and goofs.

57:49.920 --> 57:51.760
We're the ones that distract you from death.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.280
Who is to distract us?

57:53.280 --> 57:55.200
No one.

57:57.280 --> 57:58.880
Yeah, well, that's all the distractions.

57:58.880 --> 57:59.440
Let's shut it down.

57:59.440 --> 58:00.720
I'm going to see the Lego movie.

58:00.720 --> 58:03.600
It's going to wash the fucking taste of this episode right out my mouth.

58:04.720 --> 58:07.040
That's all the distraction you get for this week.

58:08.240 --> 58:09.920
You can start the episode over again.

58:09.920 --> 58:13.760
Just stave off the darkness for a bit longer.

58:14.480 --> 58:16.480
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

58:16.480 --> 58:26.480
Like, Mugi, Reagan, Bryn Matheny, Vaughn Pimpin, Nick Vandersteen, Garrett Smith retweeted

58:26.480 --> 58:27.680
MBNBA and Wisdom.

58:27.680 --> 58:30.960
If you don't follow that account, they just crossed 3000 followers.

58:30.960 --> 58:33.200
It's just MBNBA in quotes.

58:33.200 --> 58:33.920
You'll enjoy it.

58:33.920 --> 58:37.840
Britton Peel, Jeannie Leslie, Jonathan, Scott Ackerman.

58:38.800 --> 58:44.320
Listen, guys, did you know that they're trying to get into Space Jam 2 made?

58:44.320 --> 58:48.240
That's a thing that a lot of you brought to our attention, and we really appreciate that.

58:49.600 --> 58:53.520
Laura Stratford, Sean DeGrade, Jeff Kroll, so many others.

58:53.520 --> 58:55.040
Thank you for tweeting about our program.

58:55.040 --> 58:55.920
I don't know how I feel.

58:56.640 --> 58:59.440
I don't know how I feel about the jam too.

58:59.440 --> 59:00.960
The jam revisited.

59:00.960 --> 59:01.840
You feel very good about it.

59:01.840 --> 59:02.320
I feel great.

59:02.320 --> 59:02.720
That's right.

59:02.720 --> 59:04.480
I just couldn't find the right words for it.

59:04.480 --> 59:07.440
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

59:07.440 --> 59:10.640
It's a departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

59:10.640 --> 59:11.920
It's great.

59:22.880 --> 59:23.680

59:27.760 --> 59:32.880

59:44.800 --> 59:46.320
That's a terrible idea.

59:46.320 --> 59:49.600
I wonder if, like, LegalZoom listens to these episodes and goes,

59:49.600 --> 59:52.240
man, they really just kind of focus on that death aspect a lot.

59:52.240 --> 59:54.880
Yeah, they really hit that death note real hard.

59:57.040 --> 59:58.320
Go check out the other shows.

59:58.320 --> 01:00:03.120

Start practicing your signature.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.560
Yeah, no, we'll have lots of extra bonus shit that we need to produce.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.640
