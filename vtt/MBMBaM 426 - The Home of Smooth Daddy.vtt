00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.840
Hello everybody, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and me, an advice show for the modern

00:47.840 --> 00:53.600
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis the McElroy.

00:53.600 --> 01:01.680
I'm your sweet baby, 30 under 30 boy, Griffin McElroy. Disturbing, disturbing brother news.

01:01.680 --> 01:05.520
Hey y'all, y'all heard about this story? That's uh, yeah, so that's-

01:05.520 --> 01:08.000
Tell me if you heard this one before. Yeah, so you heard this story,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.240
uh, you heard this one in the news. What voice are you doing?

01:10.240 --> 01:15.840
Yeah, it's me, it's me, uh, Jeremy Leno. Doesn't sound like Jeremy Leno at all.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.800
No, it's me, Jeremy Leno. Yeah, you heard this story, yeah.

01:18.800 --> 01:25.680
Paul Gosar is a congressman in Arizona and, um, he is running for re-election against,

01:25.680 --> 01:31.280
uh, a Mr. Brill and- I believe it's a doc- a Dr. Brill.

01:31.280 --> 01:34.240
Doctor, if you will. Which Dr. Brill sounds like kind of like,

01:34.240 --> 01:41.760
um, like a mid-90s Sierra, like, adventure game. Like, the mind puzzle island of Dr. Brill.

01:41.760 --> 01:46.800
Dr. Brill's prison of puzzles. I should also say, uh, after I saw what we

01:46.800 --> 01:52.160
were about to discuss, I did a quick search on Paul Gosar and he seems to fucking suck.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.400
Yeah, he sucks the- sucks the moon right out of the sky, yeah.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.000
But, he- I think we can all agree on this one, he is the victim.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.360
Well- I think in this one he's the victim,

02:01.360 --> 02:06.160
because what we have in this one is Dr. David Brill gets six of-

02:07.920 --> 02:11.760
Travis and I knew about this, Justin is coming in hot, he literally just watched this video, so-

02:11.760 --> 02:14.480
I'm coming in hot and it's the most savage thing, if you haven't watched it,

02:14.480 --> 02:18.320
look up- just- just google Paul Gosar is not working for you long.

02:18.960 --> 02:23.680
Uh, and I think it's long version, not like some weird, uh-

02:23.680 --> 02:25.920
Not like ever long. Yeah, ever long.

02:25.920 --> 02:31.440
Um, but anyway, they get six of this fool's siblings to come in the commercial and say

02:31.440 --> 02:38.080
that he's an idiot, and like, we get to dunk on him, six brothers and sisters, six siblings,

02:38.080 --> 02:42.000
to come on and say, hey listen, you know my brother? He's a dipshit.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.800
And you really shouldn't vote for him, he sucks the moon.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.680
Clean out of the sky, take it from me, and they don't-

02:47.680 --> 02:52.160
The good part is, the good good part is, they don't reveal who the people are,

02:52.160 --> 02:56.720
versus just like, uh, for the first person it's like, a medical worker,

02:56.720 --> 02:59.920
and then somebody's like, uh, a coach or something,

02:59.920 --> 03:02.560
and then somebody's like, a private investigator? What?

03:02.560 --> 03:05.120
Why? Why is his opinion important? Yeah.

03:05.120 --> 03:11.680
And then it's like, my name is Bill Gosar, and it's like, oh shit, it's dunking time.

03:11.680 --> 03:14.240
So here's what I want you guys to promise me.

03:15.440 --> 03:20.960
Promise that no matter what a fucko I turn into,

03:21.840 --> 03:25.680
let's just all promise that we'll never do this to each other, please.

03:25.680 --> 03:29.440
Do you mean specifically this thing? Like, specifically-

03:29.440 --> 03:32.720
Specifically appear in a campaign ad against our brother.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.080
For Dr. Brill.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.360
For Dr. No.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.840
See, and this is what I'm coming at this from,

03:37.840 --> 03:46.080
is I'm afraid that Dr. Brill has gotten a rush, a high, off of this incredible-

03:46.080 --> 03:48.480
Go back and watch the ad if you just watched it,

03:48.480 --> 03:52.160
and then look at his face and his wife's face there at the very end.

03:52.160 --> 03:55.680
It is fucking decadent, their little look.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.480
I think that this is the biggest rush this dude's ever gotten,

03:58.480 --> 04:05.360
and now all he's gonna wanna do is pit siblings against siblings in public venues.

04:05.360 --> 04:10.880
Do you think he reached out to them, or do you think they reached out to him?

04:10.880 --> 04:14.560
Because either way, I really wanna hear that phone call of just like,

04:14.560 --> 04:16.400
hey, you know how my brother sucks?

04:17.120 --> 04:19.200
Do you want me to do a commercial for you?

04:19.200 --> 04:20.800
Oh, I don't think that's necessary.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.400
No, no, no, we already shot it.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.080
We already shot it, get up in here.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.560
It does raise the question, did this guy call-

04:28.720 --> 04:33.680
One of two things happened to poor Paul Gosar.

04:33.680 --> 04:34.720
Who sucks.

04:34.720 --> 04:35.680
Who sucks shit.

04:35.680 --> 04:38.560
Who sucks shit, but is really the victim here on this one.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.040
Who could have got 360 dunked on so hard?

04:41.040 --> 04:43.920
He got 360 no-scoped by six siblings all at the same time.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.000
One of two things happened.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.240
Either Dr. David Brill got a phone call as like, hey, it's me, Dan Gosar.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.120
You know my brother?

04:53.120 --> 04:54.480
I fucking hate him.

04:54.480 --> 04:54.800
You wanna-

04:54.800 --> 04:55.600
Let's roll.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.280
Let's roll, let's do this thing.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.960
You got the camera, I got the words.

04:58.960 --> 04:59.200
Let's do this, baby.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.960
And then Dr. David Brill hung up the phone.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.240
He's like, that was fucking weird.

05:02.240 --> 05:05.680
And then immediately his phone rings again.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.280
Hey, it's Greg Gosar.

05:07.280 --> 05:08.960
Fuck my brother, for real though.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.800
Let's go, let's do it.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.640
I would like to believe that it went like this,

05:12.640 --> 05:16.480
like Dr. David Brill called Dan Gosar and Dan Gosar said,

05:16.480 --> 05:17.360
okay, hold on.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.440
Let me conference in five other-

05:19.440 --> 05:21.760
Let me get off the other Gosars.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.040
Valerie, I just got the strangest call.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.080
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a bing, bing.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.520
No fucking way.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.840
No fucking way is it popping off again.

05:31.840 --> 05:32.640
For real?

05:32.640 --> 05:34.080
Hey, it's Valerie Gosar.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.360
My brother's a dip shit.

05:35.360 --> 05:35.840
Let's go.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.080
Let's melt this fool.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.120
Let's melt my brother.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.320
I just unfa-

05:44.320 --> 05:45.440
The other option is,

05:46.560 --> 05:48.800
the other option is maybe just like,

05:48.800 --> 05:51.680
maybe Wilder is like, bing, bing, bing, bing.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.560
This is Vicky Gosar's office.

05:54.560 --> 05:55.840
Hey, it's Dr. David Brill.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.640
We all know your brother sucks shit.

05:58.640 --> 06:03.280
Does he suck bad enough where you'd get on TV and do it to get fun?

06:03.280 --> 06:04.160
Oh, definitely.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.520
Oh yeah, for sure.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.520
And actually, it's weird that you call right now,

06:07.520 --> 06:10.480
I'm having lunch with five of my brothers and sisters.

06:10.480 --> 06:11.840
We all hate this idiot.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.480
It's actually our monthly meeting of the ones of us

06:14.480 --> 06:16.880
that hate Wilder Gosar, our brother.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.640
Every Wednesday, we go to Applebee's

06:18.640 --> 06:20.480
and we get their $2 cocktails

06:20.480 --> 06:23.040
and the little pudding shooters that they have there at the end

06:23.040 --> 06:25.280
and we talk about how big a shithead our brother is

06:25.280 --> 06:27.920
and how bad we hate him and want to talk about it on video.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.720
It's a shame mom and dad are out of town right now.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.920
They fucking hate him.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.240
Oh, they're going to be so sad they missed this opportunity.

06:34.240 --> 06:35.760
I wish grandma hadn't passed away

06:35.760 --> 06:38.240
because her dying words were, fuck Paul Gosar.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.280
I hate that idiot.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.360
Oh my God.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.400
I promise you, Justin,

06:42.400 --> 06:44.880
I will specifically never do this thing to you.

06:44.880 --> 06:48.560
Now that's not to say that if you end up being a real fucko,

06:48.560 --> 06:52.000
that I won't like do a web series about it or something,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.800
but I will not do a campaign ad

06:54.800 --> 06:58.080
in which it is only revealed at the end that I am your brother,

06:58.080 --> 07:00.400
but I've been talking shit about you the whole time.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.920
I will not do that to you.

07:01.920 --> 07:02.480
Unless.

07:03.120 --> 07:03.520
Unless.

07:03.520 --> 07:04.000
Unless.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.960
Travis and I get a call from Dr. David Brill.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.360
I'm just saying it's not outside the realm of possibilities.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.960
I hear he's very convincing.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.080
Actually, when he made the call,

07:12.080 --> 07:14.480
these six siblings loved their brother

07:14.480 --> 07:15.840
and by the end of the call, they were like,

07:15.840 --> 07:16.560
yeah, you know what?

07:16.560 --> 07:18.320
You're right, Dr. David Brill.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.280
Fuck my brother.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.280
Vote David Brill, I guess, just cause he did the raddest thing.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.120
The raddest thing I've ever seen.

07:25.120 --> 07:29.600
That's how we decide this, is the raddest melting.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.920
Folks, this is an advice show by brothers,

07:34.640 --> 07:37.360
but for everyone, if I may be so bold.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.520
And what we do on My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

07:39.520 --> 07:41.520
we've been doing the dang thing since 2010.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.720
You know, UID always talks about their history

07:44.720 --> 07:46.080
and I feel like we don't brag enough

07:46.080 --> 07:47.840
about how long we've been in the game.

07:47.840 --> 07:48.400
But this is-

07:48.400 --> 07:50.160
That's because there's so many people

07:50.160 --> 07:51.680
who have been at it longer than us.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.240
If we were the first, or even in the top thousand,

07:54.800 --> 07:56.720
I think that we could roll on that.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.800
This is the 426th time we've done this

07:58.800 --> 08:00.800
and I think that that's worth something, anything.

08:01.520 --> 08:05.200
If you like the show, this is the time.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.160
Share it with a friend.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.880
Please, we really appreciate it.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.800
Anyway, wanted to say thank you to you.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.320
We don't say that enough up front.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.600
Thank you to you.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.280
But what do we need from you?

08:15.280 --> 08:16.000
Your questions.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.280
And then we try to answer them.

08:17.280 --> 08:21.360
MBMBAM at MaximumFun.org

08:21.360 --> 08:22.960
And let's get into the first one.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.240
Right now, it goes a little something like this.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.600
Dear brothers, I am currently in a long-distance relationship

08:29.600 --> 08:32.160
and my boyfriend recently started watching Game of Thrones.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.280
Congratulations.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.000
Congratulations.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.280
We're also very proud.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.040
Since I am not there to watch it with him,

08:37.040 --> 08:39.520
I frequently ask how far he's come along.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.280
Brothers, I recently discovered

08:44.160 --> 08:46.000
that this man started with season four

08:46.000 --> 08:54.480
and then watched season six, one, three, two, five, and seven.

08:54.480 --> 08:54.960
What?

08:54.960 --> 08:58.240
In that order.

08:58.240 --> 09:01.920
Now, he is showing the show to his brother,

09:02.800 --> 09:05.680
but instead of even this convoluted mess,

09:05.680 --> 09:10.320
he is showing the show to his brother by character storyline.

09:10.320 --> 09:10.880
What?

09:10.880 --> 09:13.760
I'm talking all of Ned Stark's scenes

09:13.760 --> 09:17.840
followed by all of Robb Stark's scenes and so on.

09:17.840 --> 09:18.320
What?

09:18.320 --> 09:20.720
Oh, and not all of the characters.

09:20.720 --> 09:24.640
He cuts out the ones he doesn't feel are important like Joffrey.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.560
My question is this.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.320
How can I get my boyfriend to stop living in chaos

09:30.320 --> 09:34.000
and watch the shows in the order they were intended?

09:34.000 --> 09:38.160
And that's from sincerely watching as God intended in Washington, D.C.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.280
This is unfathomable to me.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.560
This is unbelievable.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.280
Here's the thing.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.160
Okay, yes, the watching the seasons all out of order

09:44.160 --> 09:46.480
just seems unnecessarily chaotic,

09:46.480 --> 09:49.680
but the scene thing seems like so much work.

09:49.680 --> 09:50.640
It seems like a lot of work.

09:50.640 --> 09:54.880
It seems like he probably read something on Reddit

09:54.880 --> 09:56.080
or something like that that was like,

09:56.080 --> 09:57.520
this is the true way to experience it.

09:57.520 --> 10:01.840
This reminds me, our former boss at Polygon, Chris Grant,

10:01.840 --> 10:03.760
close friend, trusted advisor,

10:04.480 --> 10:08.160
eats his dinner one meal component at a time.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.120
Whenever you go to dinner with him,

10:09.120 --> 10:12.480
if he has peas and mashed potatoes and a chicken on his plate,

10:12.480 --> 10:15.760
he will eat all the peas before moving on to the next thing.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.280
The idea of doing this with any sort of entertainment property,

10:19.280 --> 10:20.320
doing this with like the star,

10:20.320 --> 10:21.760
this is how I watched the Star Wars movies.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.960
It's the only correct way.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.640
You start with Anakin, keep going.

10:24.640 --> 10:25.600
Oops, Luke's in this one.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.040
He's in this scene, but don't look at Luke.

10:27.040 --> 10:27.840
Don't look at Luke.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.520
It's fucking, it's unbelievable.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.920
Do you rewatch it with the other character's perspective

10:33.920 --> 10:35.440
at that point where it's like,

10:35.440 --> 10:36.800
now we're gonna watch the scene again

10:36.800 --> 10:39.200
because it does have both Rob and Ned in it,

10:39.200 --> 10:41.440
but imagine from Rob's perspective now,

10:41.440 --> 10:42.720
you have so much more insight.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.280
Now sit in that chair and look at it from this direction

10:45.280 --> 10:47.040
because that's the way Rob's looking.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.440
Don't you know who died?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.920
Don't you know who died in the big fire?

10:51.920 --> 10:53.680
If you start with season four,

10:53.680 --> 10:56.320
you know who died in the big fight on the lake?

10:56.320 --> 10:57.520
And I don't even understand,

10:57.520 --> 11:00.480
you know who won the big duel in the sky castle?

11:00.480 --> 11:02.240
Like why, do you know what I mean?

11:02.240 --> 11:03.440
You know who died?

11:03.440 --> 11:05.280
You know who kicked who down a big?

11:05.280 --> 11:07.920
You know who kicked who down a big space hole?

11:07.920 --> 11:09.200
It doesn't make any sense.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.600
How do we tell this?

11:11.600 --> 11:12.560
We need to do advice.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.160
This is obviously a wild anecdote.

11:14.160 --> 11:17.520
What can we do to like assert ourselves into the situation?

11:17.520 --> 11:19.280
The problem I have found,

11:19.280 --> 11:23.360
we had this issue when Sydney and I first got together.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.360
We'd be in her apartment and she'd be like,

11:26.240 --> 11:28.000
hey, this TV show is coming on.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.720
And I was like, well, I've never seen the show before.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.400
And she's like, well, do you just wanna watch it?

11:32.400 --> 11:33.360
And then I would have to leave.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.120
And it would be a couple of weeks

11:35.120 --> 11:36.400
before we'd speak to each other again.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.000
And then eventually we would patch things up.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.400
But this is a persistent problem.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.000
The problem that you get into is

11:42.800 --> 11:45.280
anytime you try to enforce rules

11:45.280 --> 11:50.000
or like even your opinions onto something this trivial,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.080
you come off sounding petty.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.840
Like it seems like a petty thing to argue about with somebody

11:55.840 --> 11:57.440
about how they're watching Game of Thrones,

11:57.440 --> 12:01.120
even though it's obviously the biggest possible deal.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.480
Yeah, this person is the Joker.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.840
They've made up their mind.

12:03.840 --> 12:04.960
Yes, they know what they're doing.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.400
Here's what you can do though.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.560
And it's a little sneaky and technically a lie,

12:08.560 --> 12:11.200
which is a sin, which you're gonna have to ask forgiveness.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.280
But you take the season one discs,

12:13.280 --> 12:14.640
put them in the season four box,

12:14.640 --> 12:16.640
the two discs into the six box,

12:16.640 --> 12:18.080
the three into the one,

12:18.080 --> 12:19.040
the four into the three,

12:19.040 --> 12:19.920
the five into the two,

12:19.920 --> 12:22.320
the six into the five and the seven can stay put.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.840
At least they're watching this seventh season correct.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.680
At least by the time they arrive at seven,

12:28.560 --> 12:31.760
all the pieces are together and not in any kind of order.

12:31.760 --> 12:34.960
They've jammed like a nubbin of the puzzle piece

12:34.960 --> 12:37.120
straight into the flat side of the puzzle piece.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.880
But at least by the time they get to seven,

12:38.880 --> 12:39.680
they know what they're doing.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.000
Unless you do a little switcherooney.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.960
Who's the friend that like, oh no, sorry, brother,

12:44.960 --> 12:47.200
that your boyfriend is watching this and the brother's like,

12:47.200 --> 12:48.880
I'm okay with this system too.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.720
Hi, my name is Ted Gosar

12:50.720 --> 12:53.360
and my brother showed me Game of Thrones out of order

12:53.360 --> 12:55.840
and you should vote for his opponent in this next election.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.040
Anyone else?

12:57.040 --> 12:59.360
Anyone else vote for literally anybody else

12:59.360 --> 13:00.480
than my monster brother.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.040
I got a Yahoo here.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.280
It was sent in by like everybody ever, thank you.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.760
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

13:07.760 --> 13:08.960
I'm gonna call them football.

13:09.840 --> 13:10.720
Football asks,

13:11.760 --> 13:14.640
why do people keep giving their children names

13:14.640 --> 13:16.240
that are already in use?

13:17.360 --> 13:19.520
Millions of people have the name John.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.760
We do not need anyone else named John.

13:22.880 --> 13:23.120
Oh.

13:25.760 --> 13:29.920
So what this person's suggesting is kind of like MMORPG rules

13:29.920 --> 13:34.320
where it's like, sorry, there's already a John Plymouth.

13:34.960 --> 13:35.360
Sorry.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.400
You can be John underscore underscore 420.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.840
That's still available.

13:41.840 --> 13:47.760
You can be underscore XX underscore Yankees with a Z.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.440
Killa with an A underscore underscore XX, 1999.

13:51.440 --> 13:52.720
No, sorry, that just got taken.

13:52.720 --> 13:53.840
Oh, that one got taken too.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.080
Shit, by family in New York, of course.

13:57.360 --> 13:57.920
Shit, man.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.000
And wow, I didn't even think about that, Travis.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.760
I was thinking like we'd have to get sort of unusual

14:01.760 --> 14:02.720
with our sort of names.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.000
Like, you know, John.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.360
Okay, that one's new.

14:07.360 --> 14:11.840
But what you seem to be suggesting is IRL gamer tags.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.760
Yeah, like John one.

14:13.760 --> 14:14.800
No, John one's taken.

14:15.440 --> 14:19.040
Okay, can we suggest John and it's three Js.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.240
It's a zero for the H.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.560
John is still available.

14:24.560 --> 14:25.280
Like, okay.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.280
What do you think, honey?

14:27.280 --> 14:29.360
Well, my father's name was DeJohn.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.440
Yeah, DeJohn.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.480
Like Martian Manhunter.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.640
I had a moment, this reminded me of a moment

14:36.640 --> 14:40.480
where I had to sign up for the Screen Actors Guild this week

14:40.480 --> 14:42.160
so we could be in the Trolls movie.

14:42.160 --> 14:45.360
And there is this place in there for your legal name

14:45.360 --> 14:47.040
and a space for your professional name.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.800
And I didn't really understand the differentiation.

14:49.600 --> 14:54.960
But because if you're in SAG, only one member per name, please.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.480
Like, you can't have the same member.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.480
So that's why a lot of times you'll see people

14:58.480 --> 15:01.280
throw in like initials or like,

15:02.080 --> 15:05.280
I think it's why Michael Keaton changed his name,

15:05.280 --> 15:07.280
which was originally Michael Douglas, I believe.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.040
And there was already Michael Douglas in Screen Actors Guild

15:09.040 --> 15:09.680
so he had to change it.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.440
And they called me on the phone and they said,

15:13.440 --> 15:14.960
you have some inconsistencies here.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.560
There are some times where for your professional name,

15:18.560 --> 15:21.200
you've written Justin Tyler McElroy.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.000
And I did have definitely had a moment where I was like,

15:24.000 --> 15:27.120
if I'm going to reinvent myself as a three-name man,

15:27.120 --> 15:28.720
this is the moment to do it,

15:28.720 --> 15:31.600
where I'll have to be listed in everything as

15:31.600 --> 15:33.200
and Justin Tyler McElroy.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.880
Not unlike Jonathan Taylor Thomas, if you will,

15:36.880 --> 15:38.000
something like that.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
But I passed on the energy.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.840
Can you imagine Home Improvement starring John Thomas?

15:45.840 --> 15:51.760
Can you imagine Man of the House starring John Thomas?

15:51.760 --> 15:56.000
I'll be home for Christmas with Hollywood heartthrob,

15:56.000 --> 15:56.960
John Thomas.

15:57.520 --> 16:04.880
Do you think Zachary Ty Bryant initially planned Ty in there?

16:04.880 --> 16:05.760
Or do you think he was like,

16:05.760 --> 16:07.360
he heard Jonathan Taylor Thomas was like,

16:07.360 --> 16:08.720
I'll use my middle name.

16:08.720 --> 16:09.220
What is it?

16:10.000 --> 16:10.500
Ty.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.000
I didn't really think through it.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.320
There's actually already a Zachary Tyler Bryant.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.360
So how do you feel about Zachary B.?

16:19.360 --> 16:21.040
No, we're not Zachary B.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.080
But why are there so many fucking Johns?

16:24.960 --> 16:27.040
Yeah, but why are there so many Johns?

16:27.040 --> 16:28.560
We get it, everybody.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.880
I think it's because every time a kid is born,

16:30.880 --> 16:32.320
the parent looks at and goes,

16:32.320 --> 16:34.160
you'll be the best John.

16:34.160 --> 16:34.640
Yeah.

16:34.640 --> 16:39.120
Up till now, the Johns have only been a prelude to you,

16:39.120 --> 16:40.640
John Almighty.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.040
You, the ultimate John.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.760
Maybe we'll finally get it right with this John.

16:45.760 --> 16:49.520
This John, we pin our hopes on you, John of the future.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.080
Not like John Wilkes Booth.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.520
What a shitty John.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.000
That John ruined everything.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.120
A few days ago, I was at a stoplight

16:59.120 --> 17:00.480
and I noticed the car in front of me

17:00.480 --> 17:01.760
had a bumper sticker that said,

17:01.760 --> 17:04.080
honk if you love Girl Scout cookies.

17:04.080 --> 17:05.760
I love me some girl-thin mince.

17:05.760 --> 17:06.880
So of course I honked.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.960
The lady driving the car

17:08.960 --> 17:10.800
then proceeded to roll down her window,

17:10.800 --> 17:12.400
flip me off and yell,

17:12.400 --> 17:14.640
fuck you towards me.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.800
She had that bumper sticker.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.680
So I don't know why she got so upset that I honked.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.120
Was I in the wrong?

17:21.120 --> 17:23.840
That's from Mandy in Ann Arbor.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.960
Obviously, Mandy, obviously,

17:27.520 --> 17:29.760
that lady had that bumper sticker

17:29.760 --> 17:31.680
because she hates Girl Scout cookies

17:31.680 --> 17:33.360
and she wants to know who likes them.

17:33.360 --> 17:33.600
Yeah.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.920
So she can flip them off and tell them, fuck you.

17:35.920 --> 17:38.240
I mean, there's an accident at the cookie factory

17:38.240 --> 17:40.960
and a big thin mint fell on her husband.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.760
And now she's been widowed by Girl Scout cookies.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.640
And so to know who the enemies are-

17:46.640 --> 17:48.960
landed on her husband, Thin Ben, now.

17:49.600 --> 17:50.960
Now he's Thin Ben.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.560
He's like Flat Stanley.

17:52.560 --> 17:53.760
But now he's Thin Ben.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.320
No, he died, guys.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.680
It's not a funny joke.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.440
But he died because he's very thin.

17:59.440 --> 17:59.840
Do you get it?

17:59.840 --> 18:00.800
Because he got squished.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.080
So now he's thin, like Flat Stanley.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.600
Did Flat Stanley die?

18:05.600 --> 18:08.560
Flat Stanley did die, eventually.

18:10.480 --> 18:14.080
Time still came for him even though he was a very flat boy.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.400
Time still remembered how to find Flat Stanley.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.920
He could mail himself all over the world,

18:17.920 --> 18:21.120
but time would still find him and claim him.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.120
I don't know.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.520
She just forgot she had the bumper sticker, I guess.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.400
She hadn't even heard about it.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.160
No, that can't be it, Justin.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.400
What would you shout at this lady?

18:30.400 --> 18:31.200
But cookies!

18:31.920 --> 18:32.960
Oh, right!

18:32.960 --> 18:33.440
Oh, right.

18:33.440 --> 18:33.760
Sorry.

18:33.760 --> 18:34.720
That fucking bumper.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.000
God, this happens every day.

18:36.720 --> 18:37.120
Shit.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.720
Oh, this is my brother's car.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.400
I don't like-

18:41.200 --> 18:43.120
I can't do gluten.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.720
But Doug loves gluten.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.880
Can't get enough of this stuff.

18:46.880 --> 18:51.120
Maybe she was reacting to your kill all old ladies bumper sticker.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.000
That you put on the front of your car.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.880
That you put on the front and back and sides of your car.

18:56.880 --> 19:01.600
Maybe that was the one where you have the bumper sticker that says,

19:01.600 --> 19:06.000
stab all old ladies with their own knitting needles because they deserve it.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.400
Maybe she was frustrated that you didn't see the bumper sticker

19:10.400 --> 19:12.160
right next to the Girl Scout one that says,

19:12.160 --> 19:18.480
honk if you know that I'm afraid of car horns.

19:20.480 --> 19:23.360
That one's there as like a public service as a warning.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.880
And then you have to weigh like,

19:24.880 --> 19:27.360
oh man, I do love me some dosey dose,

19:27.360 --> 19:29.840
but I do not want to freak this person.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.280
They are driving a car right now.

19:32.560 --> 19:33.280
Do you guys even-

19:34.720 --> 19:41.360
I am really, really not the type to ever sort of answer one of these signs

19:41.360 --> 19:42.800
for a signed answer at Little Caesars.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.120
Honk if you love a $5 hot and ready, honk, honk, honk.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.560
I would not honk at that,

19:46.560 --> 19:50.240
even though I do enjoy a $5 hot and ready pizza from time to time.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.680
I don't feel-

19:52.960 --> 19:54.080
That's not what the horn is for.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.400
And we've talked a lot about the horns, famously.

19:57.440 --> 20:02.480
But I don't use mine for any purpose, even like voting like this.

20:02.480 --> 20:03.280
You know what I mean?

20:03.280 --> 20:05.040
So part of it is kind of on you.

20:05.920 --> 20:06.640
Yeah.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.200
I don't know.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.440
I always wonder what people are getting out of that.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.480
Like if I honk for thin mints, what does that mean for you?

20:13.280 --> 20:16.640
I honk at labor unions when they're striking.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.040
I'll honk at that because I love that kind of stuff.

20:19.040 --> 20:19.680
See that?

20:19.680 --> 20:20.560
Supportive.

20:20.560 --> 20:23.120
So I did always wonder with people like that,

20:23.120 --> 20:24.720
if they're getting a lot of support,

20:24.720 --> 20:26.480
do you think there's a moment like midday through

20:26.480 --> 20:27.840
where they kind of regret like,

20:29.040 --> 20:31.520
I wish I could put on my sign like wave peacefully.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.960
Wave in a calm, quiet manner if you support my cause

20:34.960 --> 20:36.560
because I'm tired of getting honked at.

20:36.560 --> 20:39.360
It's frankly extremely loud and upsetting.

20:39.360 --> 20:43.360
Oh, did you maybe have a bumper sticker on your car

20:43.360 --> 20:44.800
that says, flip me off and I'll fuck you

20:44.800 --> 20:46.240
if you support labor unions?

20:46.240 --> 20:47.360
Oh, that was probably it.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.720
So we could be like bumper sticker that says,

20:50.720 --> 20:53.120
what do you like on your pizza?

20:53.120 --> 20:55.840
And I could say like, honk for just plain cheese, please.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.000
Turn on your windshield wipers

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
if you like a little pineapple on there.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.480
Turn your radio up real loud if you don't want sausage.

21:04.480 --> 21:07.200
And flash the brights if there's a murderer in my backseat.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.280
Why, why?

21:09.280 --> 21:10.960
I was doing a fun pizza ordering thing

21:10.960 --> 21:12.560
and you turn it into something scary.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.000
Happy Halloween.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.800
Do you think the person, okay,

21:16.800 --> 21:19.120
so there was a day when cars were invented

21:19.760 --> 21:22.560
and Harry T. Ford probably or something

21:23.920 --> 21:25.280
and everybody was driving them

21:25.280 --> 21:26.720
and getting buck wild in there.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.800
I bet there was like a lot of wrecks

21:28.800 --> 21:30.720
and stuff at the beginning.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.560
I know a lot of people were getting drilled.

21:32.560 --> 21:33.920
Probably back, probably back.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.760
They're basically big rocking chairs

21:35.760 --> 21:37.920
with silly big wheels on them.

21:37.920 --> 21:38.800
Yeah, it was wild.

21:39.440 --> 21:43.120
I think that whoever was in charge

21:43.120 --> 21:45.280
of automobile safety back then,

21:45.280 --> 21:46.720
do you think that on the day

21:46.720 --> 21:48.640
someone invented bumper stickers,

21:48.640 --> 21:51.040
that person who's in charge of automobile safety

21:51.040 --> 21:53.120
was kind of like, well, I wish you hadn't.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.040
Because are you fucking crazy?

21:55.040 --> 21:56.000
What are you doing?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.080
It's kind of like, you should watch.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.800
You don't need reading material.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.880
You're operating a motor vehicle.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.600
Like maybe it's just like the bumper sticker should say,

22:05.600 --> 22:07.440
please address the road.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.720
We're sharing it together.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.880
Please just be a little safer.

22:11.680 --> 22:14.800
My roads down here is an arrow pointing down.

22:16.320 --> 22:17.040
You know?

22:17.040 --> 22:19.360
I just feel like it shouldn't be allowed.

22:19.360 --> 22:20.960
I feel like it shouldn't be legal.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.040
Okay, then let me hit you with this.

22:23.680 --> 22:24.880
Audio bumper stickers.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.000
Hands-free, eyes-free bumper stickers.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.000
And it's gonna be allowed to get through

22:30.000 --> 22:32.480
those thick windows that these cars have these days

22:32.480 --> 22:34.720
to protect you from rain and bugs.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.120
They're Bluetooth, they're Bluetooth, they're Bluetooth.

22:37.120 --> 22:37.840
Oh, okay.

22:37.840 --> 22:38.880
So it jacks into your-

22:38.880 --> 22:40.720
Jacks into your Bluetooth and you drive past the car

22:40.720 --> 22:43.520
and it's like, coexist, coexist, coexist.

22:46.560 --> 22:49.600
I'm pretty sure we have exactly reached the same point

22:49.600 --> 22:52.160
that we did at one point talking about horns,

22:52.160 --> 22:55.040
which is just like you could like CB radio to each other

22:55.040 --> 22:56.880
and be like, hey, fuck you.

22:56.880 --> 23:01.440
And like, listen, I think maybe we just need our cars

23:01.440 --> 23:03.680
to be able to talk to each other like in the film Cars.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.520
Yeah, that's what we want, all the cars to be

23:05.520 --> 23:07.200
in conversation applying against us.

23:07.200 --> 23:07.760
No, thank you.

23:07.760 --> 23:08.560
I'd rather they didn't.

23:09.120 --> 23:10.880
You don't know that they'd plot against, right?

23:10.880 --> 23:12.480
I think my car and I get along fine.

23:13.360 --> 23:16.960
No, I'm saying that, yeah, but they get peer pressured into it.

23:16.960 --> 23:17.520
Oh, that's probably true.

23:17.520 --> 23:18.480
You know how cars are.

23:19.120 --> 23:21.280
Yeah, that's my favorite scene in Cars

23:21.280 --> 23:25.440
where Mater gets forced to try weed and all the cool cars.

23:28.000 --> 23:28.640
Oh, whatever.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.280
I'm not gonna watch Cars just to see that.

23:31.280 --> 23:34.240
It makes it worth it, doesn't it?

23:34.240 --> 23:35.760
That sounds fucking really funny,

23:35.760 --> 23:37.520
but I was thinking about I should watch Cars.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.840
You can find just a super cut of that scene

23:41.840 --> 23:42.720
if you want on YouTube.

23:42.720 --> 23:47.680
Just search Cars smoking weed, Mater, Larry the Cable Guy

23:48.400 --> 23:51.040
tries weed for first time and you'll find it.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.760
And well, make sure to search long after that.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.880
Has Larry the Cable Guy ever done ASMR?

23:58.880 --> 23:59.680
I need to Google it.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.040
Hold on.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.160
I never liked the let's Google this segment,

24:04.160 --> 24:06.640
but for this, I am curious.

24:06.640 --> 24:07.200
Here it is.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.560
Let me, hold on, let me patch it in.

24:08.560 --> 24:09.920
Hand me the aux cable juice.

24:10.560 --> 24:10.880
All right.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.000
Hey there, everybody.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.280
It's me, Larry the Cable Man.

24:17.280 --> 24:20.560
And I wanted to say, Lord, I apologize.

24:25.360 --> 24:26.080
Get her done.

24:26.080 --> 24:31.120
This is what it sounds like when I'm doing my good comedy

24:31.120 --> 24:32.640
at the haircut place.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.640
Snip, snip, snip, snip, Lord, I apologize.

24:38.480 --> 24:39.040
Get her done.

24:40.080 --> 24:40.880
This is nothing.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.000
You're pretty sure?

24:45.200 --> 24:47.600
I thought it was something somewhere in there,

24:48.320 --> 24:51.120
but I think that it will be looked back on kindly

24:51.120 --> 24:55.440
and we'll look back on it as we journey to the money zone.

24:55.440 --> 24:56.480
Let's go.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.280
I need to zip some recruits and I need to recruit some zips.

25:11.280 --> 25:14.240
And if you're like me, you need to go to Zip Recruiter.

25:14.240 --> 25:17.200
Job sites that overwhelm you with tons of wrong resumes.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.080
That doesn't help.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.440
That's not zip recruiting.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.840
But there is a zippier way to recruit,

25:21.840 --> 25:24.800
and that's at ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.680
Zip Recruiter's powerful matching technology

25:27.680 --> 25:29.600
finds the right people for you

25:29.600 --> 25:31.920
and actively invites them to apply.

25:31.920 --> 25:34.960
It's no wonder that Zip Recruiter is rated number one

25:34.960 --> 25:36.720
by employers in the US.

25:37.360 --> 25:41.120
So right now, our listeners can try Zip Recruiter for free

25:41.120 --> 25:44.000
at ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.600
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.600
Juice, do you wanna do Squarespace?

25:49.600 --> 25:50.960
You want me to do it, bud?

25:50.960 --> 25:52.560
Ah, bud, I'd love to.

25:52.560 --> 25:55.200
Here's a quick word from Squarespace.

25:55.200 --> 25:55.760
What is it?

25:58.240 --> 25:59.520
Squarespace or the quick word?

26:00.080 --> 26:01.280
No, it's both.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.080
It's Squarespace.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.840
It's a website, but it's...

26:03.840 --> 26:05.760
Okay, this one's tough.

26:06.320 --> 26:07.360
Think about it for a second.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.960
It's a website where you make other websites.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.000
Excuse me?

26:12.000 --> 26:12.400
Whoa.

26:12.400 --> 26:15.920
Yeah, you can make a beautiful one.

26:15.920 --> 26:19.280
Damn, that's fucking crazy, though.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.880
Can you imagine a sandwich that makes other sandwiches?

26:23.760 --> 26:25.920
I just watched Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.

26:25.920 --> 26:29.440
This is like that machine that makes water into food,

26:29.440 --> 26:30.320
but for real.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.160
And you need to be careful with that Squarespace

26:32.160 --> 26:34.000
because it almost ended bad for them.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.520
It's a good fucking flick, though.

26:35.520 --> 26:36.320
Great fucking flick.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.360
It's real good.

26:37.360 --> 26:41.040
I like the scene where they convince the little monkey

26:41.040 --> 26:42.960
to smoke weed through peer pressure.

26:42.960 --> 26:47.040
How cool would it be if that shit was real, though?

26:47.040 --> 26:51.920
If you could have a burger party that was so big.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.000
At the park, you're just playing around,

26:54.000 --> 26:55.200
and then there's a huge burger.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.960
How fucking tight would that be?

26:56.960 --> 27:00.240
Do you ever imagine a boardroom of tuxedoed executives

27:00.240 --> 27:03.280
listening to our advertisements for their company?

27:03.280 --> 27:07.120
Like, this is what we spent how much money on?

27:08.960 --> 27:10.800
Squarespace, you knew what you were paying for,

27:10.800 --> 27:11.600
or maybe you didn't,

27:11.600 --> 27:13.040
but someone will tell you about it.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.280
But what if your principal was being a real ding-dong

27:15.280 --> 27:18.000
and a huge flapjack came and squooshed them?

27:18.000 --> 27:18.500
Yes.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.240
Squarespace, this happens when you buy in bulk.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.160
You're not gonna get...

27:24.160 --> 27:27.120
Not every podcast you choose is gonna be a winner.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.840
No, they used to be good, but this ad's gone spoiled.

27:31.280 --> 27:35.040
Just like the food, the big food that falls down in coffee.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.880
I pictured the executives sitting around the boardroom

27:36.880 --> 27:39.200
listening like, we've done it again!

27:39.200 --> 27:41.680
And enjoying their big bags of money.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.000
Please go enjoy Squarespace.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.280
They're not gonna like this ad,

27:45.280 --> 27:48.880
but if a lot of people go and buy the product because of...

27:48.880 --> 27:50.400
Maybe when you go...

27:50.400 --> 27:53.360
So you can go get the website technology that's awesome.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.440
Free and secure hosting is so tight.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.440
If you head to squarespace.com slash my brother,

27:57.440 --> 27:58.240
you get a free trial.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.160
When you're ready to launch, you use the offer code my brother,

28:00.160 --> 28:02.960
and you'll save 10% off the first purchase of a website or domain.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.560
The squarespace.com slash my brother,

28:04.560 --> 28:05.600
enter code my brother.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.520
That's awesome, because it'll let them know

28:07.520 --> 28:08.800
that you did it because of us.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.480
But if you can somehow make your website

28:10.480 --> 28:14.000
about how this specific Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs

28:14.000 --> 28:16.640
sort of centered ad is the one that got you there,

28:16.640 --> 28:18.400
it's gonna open a lot of doors for us in the future.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.600
A website about one of the best ads anybody's ever made.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.920
You can just call it bigburgerparty.com.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.280
Have the part of us talk about the big burger

28:27.280 --> 28:28.960
falling into the park, or you can call it-

28:28.960 --> 28:30.800
Or the flapjack, the flapjack crushing the principal.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.400
Yeah, flapjackskloosh.com.

28:33.040 --> 28:36.880
Gotta stop the show to see if burgerparty.com is available.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.080
Sorry, kids.

28:38.080 --> 28:39.840
Keep podcasting around me.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.480
Sure, here's a Jumbotron.

28:42.480 --> 28:46.320
This one's for Will, and it's from Kat, Nick, and Bug,

28:46.320 --> 28:50.000
who say, happy birthday to our favorite rebel just for kicks.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.080
We couldn't think of a better way to celebrate it

28:52.080 --> 28:53.280
than sending you this message

28:53.280 --> 28:54.800
from the host of our favorite podcast.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.680
So here's your sweet, sweet POTG.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.920
Regardless of when you hear this,

29:01.920 --> 29:03.280
we hope you're having a good day

29:03.280 --> 29:05.200
and getting plenty of protein.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.000
Love you always.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.240
Podcast of the-

29:08.240 --> 29:09.280
Is that play the game?

29:10.080 --> 29:11.120
Play the game?

29:11.120 --> 29:12.000
Maybe.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.600
Podcast of the Griffin.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.680
Podcast of the Griffin is a fun one.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.360
Juice, just checking on our burger party?

29:18.640 --> 29:21.040
Burgerparty is a miss.

29:21.040 --> 29:24.160
Bigburgerparty.com is ours.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.280
That's way better.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.160
It's way better.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.240
So you know a good way of getting plenty of-

29:28.240 --> 29:30.560
Will, you know a good way to get lots of protein.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.640
Come and eat this big burger, bud.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.880
Bigburgerparty.com.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.960
Oh shit, what about bigburger.party?

29:37.920 --> 29:38.480
Nah, bud.

29:39.520 --> 29:40.080
Nah, bud.

29:40.960 --> 29:41.760
Nah, bud.

29:41.760 --> 29:44.480
I don't believe in sites that aren't dot coms.

29:44.480 --> 29:45.120
Oh, okay.

29:45.920 --> 29:48.080
I feel like those are going to be the first ones

29:48.080 --> 29:50.000
that get shut down.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.240
Damn, burger.party is already taken.

29:52.240 --> 29:53.040
Fuck this website.

29:54.080 --> 29:56.000
Somebody please read this next jumbo, Sean.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.440
Internet is over, y'all.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.400
Let me read it.

29:58.400 --> 29:59.280
I got it.

29:59.280 --> 29:59.780
Okay.

30:00.560 --> 30:04.160
This is a message for Jamie from Ariel.

30:04.160 --> 30:07.040
It says, to my BFF, how's your stomach today?

30:07.040 --> 30:09.920
I'm nervous about making these few words worth it.

30:09.920 --> 30:12.400
I hope I don't waste them talking about being nervous.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.600
That would be stupid.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.280
Thank you for being a queen.

30:15.920 --> 30:18.800
Thank you for never letting me watch The Fault in Our Stars

30:18.800 --> 30:20.480
twice in one day again.

30:21.280 --> 30:24.080
Thank you for my intro to Bim Bam.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.280
Happy birthday.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.040
I really like that.

30:27.040 --> 30:28.560
How's your stomach today?

30:28.560 --> 30:29.760
Because that is such a-

30:29.760 --> 30:32.880
It's an applicable question every day.

30:32.880 --> 30:36.400
Day to day, I would give you a different answer to that question.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.280
I got to tell you, y'all, I don't know if you've ever tried

30:39.280 --> 30:42.160
watching Fault in Our Stars a few times in a row.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.880
You pick up on a lot of shit the second or third time.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.840
I watched it, and then I watched it a second time,

30:48.880 --> 30:50.320
but in half speed.

30:51.120 --> 30:54.480
You see a lot of stuff that the director didn't really make

30:54.480 --> 30:56.560
so obvious the first time around, and I started to think

30:56.560 --> 30:58.720
that maybe the fault actually was the stars.

30:59.760 --> 31:02.640
Yeah, so there's a whole secret thread there

31:02.640 --> 31:03.920
where you're like, is it the stars?

31:03.920 --> 31:05.040
But then you watch it the third time,

31:05.040 --> 31:07.200
and yeah, I'm pretty convinced it's not up there.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.680
Is that the one with Nicolas Cage in the map

31:09.680 --> 31:12.640
on the back of the declaration or something?

31:12.640 --> 31:13.680
Is that that one?

31:13.680 --> 31:15.200
That's The Fault in Our Map.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.480
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.640
Ah, somebody got lemon juice on this map.

31:18.640 --> 31:18.960
Fuck.

31:19.520 --> 31:20.480
Dang on it.

31:20.480 --> 31:21.360
Ah, fuck.

31:21.360 --> 31:23.200
The way it's stained, it kind of looks like a map.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.480
You've ruined it, Doug.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.040
Ah, shit.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.480
Someone drew a triangle with an eyeball

31:26.480 --> 31:27.760
inside it on the constitution.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.240
Dang it.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.640
You've ruined another good one.

31:30.640 --> 31:33.040
We don't have a lot of paper because it's back in old times,

31:33.040 --> 31:35.920
so we're going to keep using it, but don't do it again.

31:35.920 --> 31:38.640
Don't doodle shit on the constitution there, Jeffrey.

31:38.640 --> 31:39.040
Fuck.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.120
I'm going to show you something.

31:42.480 --> 31:44.480
Something very instructive.

31:44.480 --> 31:47.840
Let me see your dollar bill, Nicolas Cage.

31:48.480 --> 31:49.280
Oh, okay.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.680
Watch this and understand the truth behind it all.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.280
And then he sets it on fire.

31:55.280 --> 31:59.280
Nicolas Cage is like, I wish you wouldn't do that.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.480
That was my dollar bill.

32:01.200 --> 32:04.320
Nicolas, Nicolas, I have a thing to show you.

32:04.320 --> 32:06.640
It will unveil the secrets of America.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.880
It's a Land O'Lakes butter box.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.440
If you cut the knees out and you move them up here,

32:11.440 --> 32:12.400
Nicolas, are you looking?

32:12.400 --> 32:14.880
Nicolas, Nicolas, look at the Land O'Lakes butter box.

32:14.880 --> 32:17.120
If you cut the knees out and you move them up here,

32:17.120 --> 32:19.040
it makes them look like yabos.

32:19.760 --> 32:23.360
Now, Nicolas, Nicolas, now multiply that by eight.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.040
Now turn it upside down.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.200
It's boobs.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.440
Nicolas, it's in the corner of the bill.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.280
It looks like a tiny spider.

32:31.840 --> 32:33.040
It's not on all of them.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.520
That spider?

32:35.520 --> 32:37.360
Abraham Lincoln.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.640
Think about this.

32:38.640 --> 32:44.160
Every dollar bill, Caesar Augustus used to inhale blow.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.640
That's something I read on Snopes.

32:47.200 --> 32:47.600
Yes.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.760
I've run out of things, but I'm so lonely

32:51.760 --> 32:53.200
and I'm just glad you keep stopping by.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.400
Wait, come back.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.120
What is it?

32:55.120 --> 32:57.360
No, I thought of another one.

32:57.360 --> 32:58.160
Listen to this.

32:59.040 --> 33:04.000
When Gene Wilder opened the costume jacket

33:04.000 --> 33:07.680
that he was to wear in his role as Willy Wonka.

33:07.680 --> 33:08.480
Uh-huh, go on.

33:08.480 --> 33:09.760
Are you getting to a point soon?

33:09.760 --> 33:11.280
Yes, I promise.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.840
When he opened the costume jacket inside,

33:13.840 --> 33:18.400
there was a name tag reading Frank L. Baum.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.440
Who's that?

33:19.440 --> 33:21.040
Um, it was the-

33:21.040 --> 33:23.440
Nicolas, do you really not-

33:23.440 --> 33:27.520
No, Frank L. Nicolas, I'm surprised.

33:29.280 --> 33:31.120
No, wait, did I say-

33:31.120 --> 33:32.640
God damn it.

33:32.640 --> 33:35.360
I've conflated Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

33:35.360 --> 33:36.800
in Wizard of Oz.

33:36.800 --> 33:37.760
God damn it.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.680
Okay, I'm really gonna go this time.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.000
What just happened?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.960
What was the last minute and a half of this podcast?

33:44.960 --> 33:54.400
What the fuck were you trying to achieve, Juicer?

33:54.400 --> 33:56.080
Okay, so let me take you inside.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.040
Do we have time?

33:57.040 --> 33:57.680
Oh, boy.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.560
Yeah, I think we've got another 15 minutes

34:00.560 --> 34:02.880
for you to explain the last 30 seconds.

34:02.880 --> 34:03.840
I had a care-

34:03.840 --> 34:04.720
Just the last part.

34:04.720 --> 34:06.480
We were all having fun before that, right?

34:07.120 --> 34:07.360
Yeah.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.200
When we were doing the guy-

34:09.200 --> 34:09.520
Yeah.

34:09.520 --> 34:10.400
Okay, this is the guy.

34:10.400 --> 34:11.280
Okay, so-

34:11.280 --> 34:14.640
And he was showing off fun childhood life hacks.

34:14.640 --> 34:16.000
Like the Land O' Lake's Butterbox

34:16.000 --> 34:16.640
and the spider-

34:16.640 --> 34:17.440
Right, and it was fun.

34:18.720 --> 34:23.440
So, guy who played the wizard in Wizard of Oz, okay?

34:24.080 --> 34:28.160
He gets his jacket for his costume

34:28.800 --> 34:32.000
and inside the costume for the wizard,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.800
the actor playing the wizard,

34:34.800 --> 34:41.040
inside there, the jacket has a name tag inside Frank Morgan's jacket.

34:41.040 --> 34:41.600
Inside it?

34:41.600 --> 34:44.720
No way this is in the show.

34:44.720 --> 34:45.440
While we're on the panel,

34:45.440 --> 34:47.600
we have just 30 seconds to prove to Max Fun listeners

34:47.600 --> 34:49.120
that we know what the F we're talking about

34:49.120 --> 34:50.320
when it comes to pop culture.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.600
All right, you guys, let's go.

34:51.600 --> 34:52.640
Famous Chris's.

34:52.640 --> 34:53.200
Walk-in.

34:53.200 --> 34:53.920
Christopherson.

34:53.920 --> 34:54.480
Hemsworth.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.880
Karen, what's the most iconic lesbian snack?

34:56.880 --> 34:57.920
The wings at Hooters.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.240
The answer is fried green tomatoes.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.800
Margaret, what is the Marvel Cinematic Universe missing?

35:02.800 --> 35:03.520
My interest.

35:03.520 --> 35:06.160
Winter, name someone who will EGOT in your lifetime.

35:06.160 --> 35:07.200
Ike Barron holds.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.480
That's beautiful.

35:08.480 --> 35:09.680
Top gear or top model?

35:09.680 --> 35:12.320
Sadly, I have to say top gear.

35:12.320 --> 35:13.680
The clear answer is top chef.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.760
But top model taught us about smizing.

35:16.400 --> 35:16.960
Pop Rockets.

35:16.960 --> 35:18.240
Smart takes on everything.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.240
Catch us every Friday on Maximum Fun.

35:20.800 --> 35:23.120
Hey, I have a Yahoo for everybody if you'll allow it.

35:23.120 --> 35:23.680
I'll allow it.

35:23.680 --> 35:24.180
Okay.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.080
Adrian Cowell sent this one in.

35:26.080 --> 35:26.880
Thank you, Adrian.

35:26.880 --> 35:28.480
It's anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

35:28.480 --> 35:29.440
I'm gonna call them.

35:30.640 --> 35:36.000
Ty asks, I bought a silver necklace to my friend as a gift.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.840
How do I tell her it's real silver without sounding like bragging?

35:42.720 --> 35:43.220
Nancy.

35:43.920 --> 35:46.240
Yeah, it's a good necklace, Nancy.

35:46.240 --> 35:49.040
Do you notice the way it catches the light, Nancy, in a special way?

35:49.040 --> 35:50.400
And the heft?

35:50.400 --> 35:51.680
The heft of it, Nancy.

35:51.680 --> 35:58.480
It doesn't seem to have the sort of atomic weight of iron or steel or brushed copper

35:58.480 --> 35:59.760
or anything like that, Nancy.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.600
And how would you describe the color of the necklace?

36:02.320 --> 36:03.200
Ah, interesting.

36:03.200 --> 36:03.760
Do you think it's...

36:03.760 --> 36:05.120
Oh, you said silver.

36:05.120 --> 36:10.640
Do you think it's maybe possible that that is actually what it's made up out of, Nancy?

36:10.640 --> 36:12.960
And then you say, Nancy, look behind you.

36:12.960 --> 36:13.840
It's a werewolf.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.320
Please provide me your necklace.

36:16.880 --> 36:17.360
Oh, I like that.

36:17.360 --> 36:18.080
And you turn around.

36:18.640 --> 36:21.760
It's like, oh, my eyes deceived me, Nancy.

36:21.760 --> 36:26.160
But it would have been interesting that I asked for your necklace in that instance.

36:26.160 --> 36:26.660
Hmm.

36:26.960 --> 36:27.840
One moment, Nancy.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.240
I have to call the silver necklace store.

36:30.240 --> 36:30.740
Ring ring.

36:31.360 --> 36:35.040
Oh, you have one less necklace than you did this morning.

36:35.040 --> 36:38.240
I wonder where it ended up.

36:38.240 --> 36:40.000
A customer came in and purchased it.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.720
Oh, who matches my exact physical description.

36:42.720 --> 36:43.920
Nancy, are you hearing this?

36:44.480 --> 36:46.400
Maybe you need a confederate.

36:46.400 --> 36:50.080
Someone who's going to show up and say, like, I just need to borrow.

36:50.080 --> 36:52.880
Does anyone have a real silver necklace?

36:52.880 --> 36:56.240
I just need it for two minutes to save this man's life.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.280
Oh, you need a third.

36:57.280 --> 37:00.560
Okay, you need another confederate who's staging a heart attack.

37:00.560 --> 37:02.400
And maybe a confederate pretending to be a doctor.

37:02.400 --> 37:04.800
So you're going to need three confederates.

37:04.800 --> 37:05.440
Yeah, yeah.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.240
And then maybe like a crowd of confederates that are all like, he's really dying.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.360
So you're going to need 26 people.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.600
You're going to need a flash mob, essentially, yeah.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.100
Yes.

37:16.560 --> 37:22.960
What if you go to Nancy and you say, Nancy, I should have asked yesterday,

37:23.680 --> 37:27.120
do you have an allergy to silver?

37:27.120 --> 37:28.160
Oh, that's it.

37:28.160 --> 37:33.360
Then Nancy's like, yes, I do.

37:33.360 --> 37:36.560
And you're like, that shouldn't be a problem.

37:36.560 --> 37:39.120
Normally, when people have those sorts of reactions,

37:39.120 --> 37:41.200
they're because nickel has been blended in.

37:42.320 --> 37:43.120
Interesting.

37:43.120 --> 37:45.760
Must be pure silver you've got there.

37:46.320 --> 37:51.120
Oh, boy, someone must have really rolled out the proverbial red carpet for you.

37:51.680 --> 37:54.000
Oh, actually, I'm allergic to real silver, too.

37:54.800 --> 37:55.840
Nobody is, Nancy.

37:55.840 --> 37:56.720
That's ridiculous.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.400
It's hypoallergenic metals.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.280
Okay, well, then why is my neck burning?

38:01.280 --> 38:02.160
Oh, God.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.160
Oh, no, I've been swindled.

38:04.160 --> 38:07.440
Now, I've hoisted on my own petard.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.280
Now, I am the real fool.

38:12.080 --> 38:15.280
You can always, like the day after you give the necklace, walk up and say like,

38:15.280 --> 38:18.160
oh, Nancy, what a nice pure silver necklace you're wearing.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.200
Who got you that?

38:19.200 --> 38:23.440
Oh, I completely forgot that I'm the one who got you the necklace.

38:23.440 --> 38:24.480
This is embarrassing.

38:24.480 --> 38:25.760
I have memento.

38:25.760 --> 38:28.640
As you know, I have a bad case of memento.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.600
Is my face red, much like your neck?

38:31.600 --> 38:33.760
Also, sorry again about that.

38:33.760 --> 38:37.200
It's time to sing my favorite song from my favorite Christmas movie,

38:37.200 --> 38:38.320
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

38:38.320 --> 38:38.880
Here we go.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.160
Nancy's necklace and gold.

38:42.160 --> 38:44.000
Oh, that's weird that I sang it like that.

38:44.000 --> 38:44.500
Golly.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.960
Hi-ho, Nancy's necklace.

38:46.960 --> 38:49.120
You know, just a little goof.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.400
It's silver, Nancy.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.960
I bought you an expensive necklace, Nancy.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.480
I need you to see it, Nancy.

38:54.480 --> 38:56.000
See me, Nancy.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.200
See me here.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.800
See me as a man, Nancy.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.120
A man with means to buy you a better necklace.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.840
To buy you a pure silver necklace, Nancy.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.520
I can provide for you.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.680
I am not the child you knew once, Nancy.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.480
I have been working double shifts at the Taco Bell

39:12.480 --> 39:15.280
to buy you a pure silver necklace, Nancy.

39:15.280 --> 39:18.960
I went away to one semester of college and I've grown, Nancy.

39:19.760 --> 39:23.760
Let me care for you as only I can.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.600
Nancy, I am but a man.

39:26.320 --> 39:30.960
A man who read the cliff notes of Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance

39:30.960 --> 39:34.320
and he stands now before you to say that necklace is silver.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.040
And my heart is gold.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.240
And my heart is gold.

39:39.200 --> 39:40.400
Here is another question.

39:40.400 --> 39:42.400
It goes a little something like this.

39:44.080 --> 39:47.520
This one maybe we don't need to talk about, but I do want to share it.

39:47.520 --> 39:50.560
I saw something strange while driving home from work earlier this week.

39:50.560 --> 39:53.440
Due to heavy traffic, I took a route I wouldn't normally take.

39:53.440 --> 39:56.080
And while driving through a neighborhood I'm not familiar with,

39:56.080 --> 39:58.400
I noticed a blue figure on someone's front lawn.

39:58.400 --> 40:03.040
As I got closer, I saw that it was a cutout of a Navi for the movie Avatar

40:03.040 --> 40:05.840
holding a sign that read, Home of Smooth Daddy.

40:06.480 --> 40:07.760
Was that real?

40:07.760 --> 40:10.240
If so, who could have made it and why?

40:11.200 --> 40:12.960
I mean, probably Smooth Daddy.

40:13.600 --> 40:19.040
Smooth Daddy would be the only one using the Navi to tout his own Smooth Daddy.

40:19.040 --> 40:19.760
Hey guys?

40:19.760 --> 40:21.520
It might be Smooth Son though.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.000
Smooth Son might have made it for his Smooth Daddy.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.040
Hey guys?

40:25.040 --> 40:25.760
Yes, Griffin?

40:25.760 --> 40:30.320
I do not appreciate you giving out my personal home address on our show.

40:30.320 --> 40:44.000
We went to the world of Avatar in the animal kingdom of Walt Disney World.

40:44.640 --> 40:47.840
And it was fucking packed.

40:48.640 --> 40:49.040
Packed.

40:49.040 --> 40:52.560
Absolutely packed for a movie that came out fucking 18 years ago.

40:52.560 --> 40:54.880
And I'm sorry, the sequel will never be released.

40:54.880 --> 40:56.080
Ever, ever, ever.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.680
Sorry, it will never be released.

40:57.680 --> 41:01.680
And the thing you can notice in the crowd is there are a handful of people

41:01.680 --> 41:06.960
who are like very excited to be in the world of the Navi here on Pandora

41:06.960 --> 41:09.280
sharing in their culture and their ritual.

41:10.240 --> 41:11.680
Very, very excited.

41:11.680 --> 41:17.280
Not like theme park excited, but like over the moon stoked to be in the land of Pandora.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.000
They were rock hard.

41:18.000 --> 41:18.640
They were rock hard.

41:18.640 --> 41:19.600
Rock hard.

41:19.600 --> 41:20.100
Yeah.

41:20.400 --> 41:24.720
There's a part of this question that I do not understand the context in which that question

41:24.720 --> 41:30.000
is being asked, which is you saw like a Navi cut out holding a sign that said

41:30.000 --> 41:31.200
home of smooth daddy.

41:31.200 --> 41:34.080
And then you ask, was that real?

41:34.080 --> 41:34.640
Was it real?

41:34.640 --> 41:39.440
Do you mean, I certainly don't mean like was that like a thing that exists in the world

41:39.440 --> 41:40.400
because you saw it.

41:40.400 --> 41:43.920
So do you mean was that actually the home of smooth daddy?

41:45.280 --> 41:48.720
That is the only thing you could mean because you know it wasn't a real Navi

41:48.720 --> 41:50.560
and you know you really saw the thing.

41:50.560 --> 41:55.840
So the only question marks left here is is indeed that the home of smooth daddy.

41:56.480 --> 42:03.200
And I have to assume, yes, it either is the home of smooth daddy or that sign was placed

42:03.200 --> 42:08.000
there only moments before you saw it before the person who lived there was able to remove

42:08.000 --> 42:08.400
it.

42:08.400 --> 42:08.720
All right.

42:09.440 --> 42:13.600
I just did Google to see if I could find a picture of the sign because if this exists

42:13.600 --> 42:16.960
in somebody's yard, there's no way that somebody hasn't like taken a pic of it yet.

42:17.760 --> 42:18.560
I didn't find it.

42:18.560 --> 42:23.120
I did find a Cafe Press sign that somebody, you know, designed themselves and put up on

42:23.120 --> 42:25.280
Cafe Press because they needed a copy of their own.

42:25.280 --> 42:31.040
And it's a sign in as a white sign with big black font that reads never underestimate

42:31.040 --> 42:33.120
a smooth Fox Terrier daddy.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.640
Oh, OK.

42:35.360 --> 42:43.040
This is somebody who is perhaps the proud, you know, parent of a smooth Fox Terrier.

42:43.040 --> 42:49.040
And they people have been talking shit about what they can and can't do, I guess, for

42:49.040 --> 42:50.960
a while, like what their capabilities are.

42:50.960 --> 42:55.680
People have been underestimating this daddy of a smooth Fox Terrier and they want everybody

42:55.680 --> 42:58.960
to know I do have this dog breed on hand at any time.

42:58.960 --> 43:01.200
So don't stop talking shit.

43:01.200 --> 43:08.000
There is a band called the Smooth Daddy Band, smoothdaddyband.com.

43:08.000 --> 43:13.760
Do you think that maybe this is the like if you're looking for rehearsals of the Smooth

43:13.760 --> 43:20.560
Daddy Band, this is the home where we rehearse to practice our craft?

43:20.560 --> 43:22.880
I just hope that this theme continues then.

43:22.880 --> 43:26.080
And it's also like this is the show of smooth daddy.

43:26.080 --> 43:27.920
This is the car of smooth daddy.

43:27.920 --> 43:29.440
This is the shirt of smooth daddy.

43:30.640 --> 43:32.880
You can buy it for twenty five dollars.

43:32.880 --> 43:40.960
Hey, here's a quick Yahoo to, you know, get us get us home.

43:40.960 --> 43:43.280
The cinema Morgan Daddy.

43:43.280 --> 43:44.000
Yeah, thank you.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.200
Is sent in by Morgan Davy.

43:45.200 --> 43:45.760
Keep it wavy.

43:45.760 --> 43:46.320
Morgan Davy.

43:46.320 --> 43:48.000
It's Yahoo answers user.

43:48.000 --> 43:48.960
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.080
Can I give it a quick refresh?

43:50.080 --> 43:52.640
See if the data will be injected into my rig?

43:53.280 --> 43:54.320
No, absolutely not.

43:54.320 --> 43:58.960
This was asked by smooth daddy who asks on the Tom Hanks movie Castaway.

44:00.240 --> 44:01.120
What was in the box?

44:01.120 --> 44:01.840
He never opened.

44:01.840 --> 44:04.480
And why didn't he open the stinking box?

44:05.040 --> 44:06.960
It ruined the whole movie for me.

44:06.960 --> 44:10.240
My husband claims it has something to do with the symbolism that he was a company man and

44:10.240 --> 44:11.280
trying to do what was right.

44:11.280 --> 44:15.680
Well, if he opened up the other stupid boxes, why bother to save that one?

44:15.680 --> 44:21.200
Tell me something that will make it all better inside.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.000
Oh, tell me something.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.960
Make it better inside the boxes.

44:26.960 --> 44:28.800
Marcellus Wallace's soul.

44:28.800 --> 44:29.920
OK, OK.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.000
I mean, that's one, too, that one, too, sucks.

44:32.000 --> 44:32.880
Open it up.

44:32.880 --> 44:34.080
Oh, the gold light.

44:34.080 --> 44:35.280
Pretty cool, right?

44:36.000 --> 44:37.440
What was it, though?

44:38.480 --> 44:42.320
Come on, tell me something that makes it feel better.

44:43.040 --> 44:46.240
It hurts so bad not knowing the box.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.840
The box had angel wings on it.

44:49.840 --> 44:51.520
That's what that's the only thing we know.

44:51.520 --> 44:57.120
And so maybe you didn't open it because it's like, what if there's an angel inside here

44:57.120 --> 45:00.640
or like weird old wings or dusty angel robes?

45:00.640 --> 45:03.440
There's nothing angel related that's going to be helpful.

45:03.440 --> 45:06.960
It's not going to be like, here's my angel brand coconut peeler.

45:07.520 --> 45:08.000
Sure.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.040
And honestly, I've let this thing stay closed for so long.

45:11.040 --> 45:14.560
That angel is definitely dead in that box.

45:14.560 --> 45:18.400
I did not poke holes in it or feed it the food that angels love to eat, which I guess

45:18.400 --> 45:19.680
is just angel food cake.

45:21.280 --> 45:25.360
So this angel is dead as hell, and I do not want to open this box because I'm going to

45:25.360 --> 45:29.120
see it and feel bad and the stink, the stink, the rotting stink.

45:29.120 --> 45:32.080
The cherubic rotting stink of this little angel.

45:33.040 --> 45:35.440
I don't know why I didn't open the box right away.

45:35.440 --> 45:40.240
I thought maybe it might be cool to have one box that wasn't open and then I put two and

45:40.240 --> 45:40.800
two together.

45:40.800 --> 45:42.640
There's definitely a dead old angel here.

45:42.640 --> 45:44.480
I don't want that on my conscience.

45:44.480 --> 45:45.840
So I'm going to deliver this.

45:46.400 --> 45:46.960
Hey, ma'am.

45:47.760 --> 45:50.640
Listen, I was on an island for a long time.

45:50.640 --> 45:51.360
Here's a box.

45:51.360 --> 45:52.320
Gotta go.

45:52.320 --> 45:54.240
Why didn't you feed my angel?

45:54.240 --> 45:55.440
What the hell, dude?

45:57.680 --> 45:58.720
It's possible.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.480
Maybe he knew it was a bomb.

46:01.200 --> 46:03.280
And he's not trying to fuck around with that.

46:03.840 --> 46:05.120
This is the one bomb.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.240
I know this.

46:06.240 --> 46:07.680
Maybe the box was empty.

46:07.680 --> 46:12.640
It's been a while since I've seen Kezdaway, so there's probably a concrete answer to this.

46:12.640 --> 46:20.960
But how long do you think that Tom Hanks' character, whose name escapes me, how long

46:20.960 --> 46:24.480
do you think that he stood there on the porch like, huh?

46:24.480 --> 46:25.280
Huh?

46:25.280 --> 46:26.240
What do you think?

46:26.240 --> 46:27.920
Oh, exactly a tip?

46:27.920 --> 46:29.680
Did you, uh, hello?

46:30.480 --> 46:31.120
Pretty good, right?

46:31.680 --> 46:34.480
I bet you thought, uh, nope, but I did.

46:34.480 --> 46:35.360
I did do it.

46:36.400 --> 46:40.320
But wait, don't congratulate me too hard because I did open all the other boxes.

46:40.320 --> 46:41.440
I opened all the other ones.

46:41.440 --> 46:42.640
I bet you didn't even see this coming.

46:42.640 --> 46:43.680
Can I tell you something?

46:44.400 --> 46:46.000
Uh, I was on an island.

46:46.000 --> 46:46.500
Ow.

46:47.040 --> 46:48.560
Okay, I was on an island.

46:48.560 --> 46:53.040
I was on, um, so, what do you think?

46:53.040 --> 46:53.760
Pretty cool, right?

46:54.480 --> 46:55.200
Yeah.

46:55.200 --> 46:55.760
Pretty cool.

46:56.400 --> 46:57.280
Anyway.

46:57.280 --> 46:58.080
What are you doing?

46:58.080 --> 46:58.960
Do you want to chill?

46:58.960 --> 47:01.040
Like, I haven't, I don't have any plans.

47:01.040 --> 47:03.040
I was on an island up until like yesterday.

47:03.040 --> 47:04.880
Everyone I ever knew is dead.

47:04.880 --> 47:06.720
So do you want to-

47:06.720 --> 47:09.760
I'm free if you just want to like, I don't know, like play some Sonic.

47:09.760 --> 47:11.280
Do people still play Sonic?

47:11.280 --> 47:11.520
Yeah.

47:11.520 --> 47:12.480
Is there a new Sonic game?

47:12.480 --> 47:14.400
Because I've been on an island for 26 years.

47:14.400 --> 47:15.840
Sonic's so radical.

47:15.840 --> 47:18.480
I was on an island.

47:18.480 --> 47:21.520
Hey, do you have a, oh, do you have a Clearly Canadian?

47:21.520 --> 47:22.800
I'm parched over here.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.200
We can drink some Clearly Canadian and watch the Arsenio Hall Show.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.360
Does that sound good to you?

47:29.360 --> 47:30.000
A cool hang?

47:30.640 --> 47:31.920
Hey, did you ever meet my dad?

47:32.640 --> 47:33.440
Or my children?

47:34.080 --> 47:34.880
My grandchildren?

47:34.880 --> 47:39.040
Hey, I'm looking for my, um, my grandchildren, I guess.

47:39.040 --> 47:40.560
They're probably adults by now.

47:40.560 --> 47:43.120
I've been on this island for like forever.

47:43.120 --> 47:47.520
So I'm looking for my adult grandchildren and their children.

47:47.520 --> 47:50.080
Because everybody else I've ever known is dead.

47:50.080 --> 47:50.320
Yeah.

47:51.040 --> 47:52.320
And are you hiring?

47:52.320 --> 47:54.800
And maybe do you have a room I could live in?

47:54.800 --> 47:57.920
Because like, I've lost my job and my mortgage for sure.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.920
I don't know sort of what future times are like.

47:59.920 --> 48:02.160
I only have two arms and two legs.

48:02.160 --> 48:07.280
I don't know sort of in your time like how what people have evolved to at this point.

48:07.280 --> 48:11.760
But I am kind of a throwback human with just the two arms and two legs.

48:11.760 --> 48:13.840
Hey, could you help me get a bank loan?

48:13.840 --> 48:16.160
Because I was definitely declared dead.

48:16.160 --> 48:18.000
And it's gonna be really hard for me.

48:18.000 --> 48:18.320
No?

48:18.320 --> 48:19.120
Okay, that's fine.

48:19.120 --> 48:21.520
I did just deliver your box.

48:21.520 --> 48:22.160
What do you have now?

48:22.160 --> 48:22.960
You're welcome.

48:22.960 --> 48:23.760
Hover banks?

48:25.120 --> 48:26.720
Can you take me to your cyber dentist?

48:26.720 --> 48:29.520
Because my teeth got really, really goofed up on the island.

48:29.520 --> 48:31.520
I have human bone teeth.

48:31.520 --> 48:35.040
I don't know if you guys have like metal teeth or what.

48:36.480 --> 48:38.880
But I just have human bone teeth.

48:38.880 --> 48:42.960
Could you program me some food because I am a real hater.

48:42.960 --> 48:47.440
Can I have a food pill or something because I'm fucking starving.

48:47.440 --> 48:49.040
Is there still water?

48:49.040 --> 48:51.840
I was worried about y'all using it all before I got back.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.040
Do you have any water left?

48:53.760 --> 48:58.000
We have water back at the island, but it tasted so yucky when you drank it.

48:58.560 --> 49:01.200
I figured that's just the way all water was these days.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.520
This yucky, it was like yucky flavor water.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.040
I hated it so much.

49:07.040 --> 49:09.440
Oh, God, my teeth stink so bad.

49:09.440 --> 49:10.240
What's in that box?

49:10.800 --> 49:12.160
Oh, it's toothbrush and toothpaste.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.680
Well, shit, that would've been cool.

49:13.680 --> 49:15.200
I'll wait while you open it.

49:15.200 --> 49:17.360
Oh, it's a change of socks.

49:17.360 --> 49:17.860
Fuck.

49:18.560 --> 49:19.840
Oh, that would've been nice.

49:19.840 --> 49:22.880
Listen, Robert Zemeckis, this is money in the bank.

49:22.880 --> 49:27.360
Make a $100 special edition castaway where you open up the box.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.240
There's a deleted scene where she opens up the box and she's like,

49:30.240 --> 49:32.400
hmm, my hand cream finally got here.

49:32.400 --> 49:33.600
Thanks, Tom.

49:33.600 --> 49:34.800
And then Tom walks away.

49:34.800 --> 49:36.000
That could be the end of the movie.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.440
Make a special edition of Pulp Fiction where they reach in the briefcase and like,

49:39.440 --> 49:40.880
oh, yeah, gold bars.

49:41.840 --> 49:43.760
It's gold bars, everyone.

49:43.760 --> 49:52.320
What if you made it like castaway two, and it was just a static shot of the box.

49:52.320 --> 49:55.360
And then at the very end, she rips it open after waiting an hour and a half,

49:55.360 --> 49:57.520
and you see her look inside fade to black.

49:57.520 --> 50:00.880
And then you do castaway three, where she dumps it into her hand,

50:01.440 --> 50:03.200
and it's another sealed box.

50:03.200 --> 50:04.080
And then castaway four-

50:04.080 --> 50:05.680
Oh, fuck, this is good.

50:05.680 --> 50:06.400
Yeah, right?

50:06.400 --> 50:09.280
And I have to be clear, these are all feature film.

50:09.840 --> 50:13.280
And then maybe Tom Hanks shows up in the bloopers of the credits

50:13.280 --> 50:17.360
so you can still list him as being in it and he can win another award or whatever.

50:17.360 --> 50:18.320
Hey guys, it's me, Tom.

50:18.320 --> 50:19.280
Hope you enjoyed the movie.

50:19.280 --> 50:23.680
I know it's mostly a woman very slowly opening up a box, but that's art these days.

50:23.680 --> 50:25.440
Anyway, I'm going to show you some bloopers now.

50:25.440 --> 50:26.880
Hope you come back for castaway four.

50:26.880 --> 50:28.720
This time, she is going to go to the kitchen.

50:28.720 --> 50:31.280
She's going to get the box cutter out, but it's going to take her an hour and a half

50:31.280 --> 50:32.640
to find replacement blades for it.

50:32.640 --> 50:34.160
So it's going to be really exciting.

50:34.160 --> 50:35.760
Robert's got some big plans for this one.

50:35.760 --> 50:37.120
Anyway, here's some bloopers.

50:37.120 --> 50:37.440
Rip.

50:37.440 --> 50:38.800
Oh, I opened it too fast.

50:38.800 --> 50:39.360
Start over.

50:40.080 --> 50:41.360
I hope this bots open-

50:41.360 --> 50:41.760
Bots?

50:42.400 --> 50:42.960
Fuck me.

50:46.560 --> 50:49.520
We hope you've enjoyed yourself here at My Brother, My Brother, and Me farms.

50:49.520 --> 50:51.760
We know that we've enjoyed having you here at the ranch.

50:52.880 --> 50:59.120
We always enjoy your visits and everyone feels more special than the last.

50:59.120 --> 51:02.720
I want to say thanks to the Maximum Fun Network for having us as a part of their

51:02.720 --> 51:04.560
extended podcasting family.

51:04.560 --> 51:05.840
We care about you deeply.

51:05.840 --> 51:10.000
I want to say briefly that my wife and I wrote a book about medical history

51:10.000 --> 51:10.880
called Sawbones.

51:11.440 --> 51:13.040
The book, the Sawbones book.

51:13.040 --> 51:13.600
Shit.

51:13.600 --> 51:14.240
Oh, okay.

51:14.240 --> 51:16.720
Bit.ly forward slash the Sawbones book.

51:16.720 --> 51:17.680
Please pre-order it.

51:17.680 --> 51:18.800
It's really important.

51:18.800 --> 51:19.680
It's fantastic.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.280
And Griffin read it.

51:21.920 --> 51:22.880
It's fantastic.

51:22.880 --> 51:23.520
Sounds good.

51:24.080 --> 51:24.800
Good book.

51:25.440 --> 51:26.480
I also real quick.

51:26.480 --> 51:30.480
So I've got a show coming up October 6th during New York Comic Con.

51:30.480 --> 51:31.680
It's in like two weeks.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.920

52:29.040 --> 52:31.280
a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

52:31.280 --> 52:33.120
You can find that one at stores.

So thank you, John.

52:36.960 --> 52:38.080

Yeah.

52:40.880 --> 52:41.520
Indeed.

52:41.520 --> 52:42.080
Yes.

52:42.080 --> 52:42.320
Sure.

52:42.320 --> 52:43.920
This one was sent in by Daniel Barrero.

52:43.920 --> 52:44.560
Thank you, Daniel.

52:44.560 --> 52:56.720
It's Yahoo Answers user Andrew August who asks, why does the smell of laser tag get me horny?

Kiss your dad's square on the lips.
