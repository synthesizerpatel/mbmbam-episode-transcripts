WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.560
Welcome, my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.560 --> 00:55.520
Griffin, I want to start the show, but I have to say, your eyes are looking so dope.

00:55.520 --> 00:59.680
It's, um, they're, they're, they really pop nowadays, don't they?

00:59.680 --> 01:06.080
Yeah, it's, it's like, uh, your eyes have a groove. Like, if I may say that

01:06.640 --> 01:09.920
my eyes are honorary members of the dog pound.

01:11.040 --> 01:14.880
Tell do tell how did you achieve this? Look, it must have been expensive.

01:14.880 --> 01:20.480
I went to the glasses store and the elderly lady who was making me try on every goddamn pair of

01:20.480 --> 01:27.200
glasses in the store. Um, she was the proprietor, not just some old lady that was in the store. Uh,

01:27.200 --> 01:32.560
she was like, you know, your eyes kind of looked like the eyes of the basis from journey. And I

01:32.560 --> 01:38.160
said, Oh, that's funny. Um, do you mean Randy Jackson? And she says, yes, I have just the

01:38.160 --> 01:44.000
glasses for you. They're Randy Jackson's glasses. Oh my, how did you afford that?

01:44.880 --> 01:51.840
They were extremely expensive. Um, but I, you know, I decided I'm 24 now going on 25.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.400
It's time that I have good things in my life.

01:54.400 --> 02:03.280
You've earned it. Um, so I, I, uh, yeah, I joined the dog pound and, um, now I make, uh,

02:03.840 --> 02:09.120
sort of inane criticisms of things that don't make any sense nor mean anything.

02:09.120 --> 02:14.000
You may, you make references to working with Michael Jackson that are apropos of nothing.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.880
Yeah. And, and just totally untrue, patently untrue, uh, speaking of patently untrue,

02:20.880 --> 02:24.640
this is an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.880
I'm your middle, his brother, Travis McElroy.

02:26.880 --> 02:34.160
I'm your youngest Randy Jackson is brother. Can we, can we start the Halloween talk now?

02:34.160 --> 02:36.000
Halloween is today. And

02:36.000 --> 02:37.920
Hello boys and ghouls.

02:37.920 --> 02:42.800
Nope. Daddy, no, like, but I've been working on that like all week. No last night. I feel

02:42.800 --> 02:48.400
like last night was the official Halloween party night. Um, did you guys partake?

02:48.400 --> 02:52.080
It's, it's not the official party night for theaters.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.600
Oh, that's right.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.280
Sunday is the new Saturday.

02:55.280 --> 03:00.480
Sunday's the new Saturday for theaters. Uh, I was thinking we could maybe go around and

03:00.480 --> 03:07.520
everybody could say what they, uh, uh, what they dressed up as. I, uh, was, uh, deposed

03:08.240 --> 03:11.120
head of the, uh, federal reserve, Ben Bernanke.

03:11.680 --> 03:12.640
Well, that's a good one.

03:12.640 --> 03:13.520
Yeah. I thought so.

03:13.520 --> 03:17.600
Um, I was a, I was a drunk baby.

03:19.760 --> 03:20.880
It's a good look.

03:20.880 --> 03:24.800
It was a good look. It did. I didn't start out. I didn't, it's complicated,

03:24.800 --> 03:31.520
but I didn't start out that I sort of became that I was, uh, sleep. Yeah.

03:32.640 --> 03:33.680
Travis is Morpheus.

03:33.680 --> 03:34.800
It's pretty bad-ass.

03:34.800 --> 03:35.280
That's what he said.

03:35.280 --> 03:44.240
Yeah. I, everybody kept asking me, Justin, I think Ben Bernanke is the current, uh, current head.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.160
I don't think you know who this person is.

03:46.160 --> 03:46.800
And then I said,

03:46.800 --> 03:48.240
I think you just like his last name.

03:48.240 --> 03:55.120
I said, I, but I addressed as him deposed. I said, Hey, it's Halloween. Live in the fantasy.

03:55.120 --> 04:01.520
I feel like if there was a governmental figure somewhere in the world with the last name Skittle

04:01.520 --> 04:04.400
Fingers, then you would have said that you were that person.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.720
Mm-hmm.

04:06.720 --> 04:12.560
Hey, also something else I was thinking about last night at while dressing as deposed chief

04:12.560 --> 04:17.280
of the federal reserve, Ben Bernanke from an alternate future where he has been removed from

04:17.280 --> 04:23.920
his position. Why is nobody saying drama, drama, save it for Obama? Why is that not caught on?

04:25.120 --> 04:28.320
Um, that's, see, that's exactly why I'm glad we have this platform.

04:28.880 --> 04:32.560
Yeah. Hey, everybody, if you could just drop that in a combo.

04:32.560 --> 04:36.400
I know I could tell from the roaring reaction it got on the show that it's a pretty good line.

04:36.400 --> 04:42.400
So wait, hold on real quick. So you're not saying chant this at like a rally or you're saying like,

04:42.400 --> 04:47.200
if you're having a conversation with a friend and find a place to work it in drama, drama,

04:47.200 --> 04:49.200
save it for Obama. Don't you think?

04:49.920 --> 04:53.120
I invented a kind of a fun Halloween party game this morning.

04:54.160 --> 04:58.080
And I think it only works on Halloween when you're a grownup and you got drunk

04:58.080 --> 05:01.200
the night before at a Halloween party where everybody's wearing costumes.

05:01.200 --> 05:07.280
And it's, um, it's called, uh, I blanked on or at blank.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.680
You fill in the blanks with a, with a verb and a thing like,

05:14.320 --> 05:17.680
like last night I threw up on a dinosaur.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.880
Last night, I farted on Skrillex.

05:22.880 --> 05:28.480
Last night, I yelled at the black eyed peas.

05:30.320 --> 05:35.920
Let's get to the advice. My trusty vehicular sidekick has finally started to kick the bucket.

05:36.480 --> 05:43.520
Soon I'll be, I'll have to be doling out some serious dough to purchase a new new to me vehicle.

05:44.320 --> 05:48.320
That's the only smart move by the way. But of course I want to get a great deal.

05:48.880 --> 05:52.000
It's been a long time since I've had to do this and I feel a bit crusty.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.720
Rusty. What are rusty? What are your best haggling tips?

05:56.720 --> 05:59.520
I feel crusty.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.520
I feel crusty. See a doctor.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.560
Um, that's from finagling Phil.

06:05.440 --> 06:11.360
I have bought a car recently. Um, and it is, it is an intimidating world out there guys.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.320
What'd you, what'd you go with?

06:12.960 --> 06:13.520
What?

06:13.520 --> 06:14.480
What'd you go with?

06:14.480 --> 06:14.800
Hearse.

06:14.800 --> 06:21.360
Payton, I got tricked. He said it was just a long car, but it was a hearse.

06:21.360 --> 06:21.920
What are you looking for?

06:21.920 --> 06:23.440
Is this an Oldsmobile long car?

06:23.440 --> 06:27.840
Is this an Oldsmobile long car? Why is there a picture of a ghost with a no sign over him?

06:27.840 --> 06:30.640
I'd buy Ecto-1.

06:30.640 --> 06:37.360
So you're looking for a sedan or a hatchback or a truck or a, we got this hearse.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.840
Got a hearse. Ecto-1.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.320
What's the, what's the brand? Oh, it's hearse.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.040
Hearse brand. Nobody knows who makes hearses.

06:45.840 --> 06:50.160
I wish I'd been there at that design meeting. Like, Phil, this is a really cool car.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.560
I don't know who you're putting in the back though. It's like, you know,

06:52.560 --> 06:54.400
you can just have somebody back there and just chill.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.320
It's like a portable nap room.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.840
It's like a portable nap room that I made.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.520
A portable forever nap room.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.760
I would love to have been in that meeting. Cause I would have said,

07:03.760 --> 07:07.520
I'm going to throw something out. Flame decals. That would be cool.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.360
Cause they're taking them to hell.

07:09.360 --> 07:17.120
Oh, I think that your, your best bet is to, and, and this is, this is tough, but

07:17.680 --> 07:20.080
go to as many different places as you can.

07:20.080 --> 07:24.400
Look at as many different cars as you can, because the, the only time that you're getting

07:24.400 --> 07:28.400
into trouble with this sort of thing is, is if you aren't willing to walk away.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.600
And if you get your heart set on a car and you think like, this is the one for me,

07:33.200 --> 07:34.640
then it's going to be harder for you to negotiate.

07:34.640 --> 07:37.200
Cause you'll be worried about losing your car.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.440
You'll be worried about losing it or worried about looking like a jerk or whatever.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.120
And remember the worst they can say is no.

07:44.480 --> 07:48.720
I bought those Randy Jackson glasses yesterday.

07:48.720 --> 07:51.280
It was the very first store I walked into.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.680
And it was almost the very first pair of glasses I saw.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.880
I bought them for $300.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.640
I don't think I know how comparison shopping works.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.640
I'm saying, I don't think you're buying a car in this situation.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.480
You're buying the man.

08:04.480 --> 08:10.640
And by the man, I mean the salesman that you have to find somebody who makes you feel

08:11.200 --> 08:12.800
like you're not getting fucked.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.160
Like he's not trying to fuck you.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.600
But Griffin, don't you understand?

08:15.600 --> 08:16.720
That is how they work.

08:16.720 --> 08:19.840
That's the exact vibe that these guys work to cultivate.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.080
Like they are trying to give you that vibe.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.840
But now let me take that a step further.

08:23.840 --> 08:27.680
They go and actually buy the man and start asking him questions like,

08:27.680 --> 08:29.040
what's your miles per gallon?

08:29.040 --> 08:29.280
Yeah.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.120
Do you have automatic windows?

08:31.120 --> 08:32.320
Do you take diesel?

08:32.320 --> 08:34.960
What are your safety features?

08:34.960 --> 08:35.760
Do you know Kung Fu?

08:37.600 --> 08:38.400
Can you protect me?

08:38.960 --> 08:42.240
I bought mine from a shady fat guy because I knew where he was coming from.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.080
I was like, hey, I get your style.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.520
You're not trying to pull one over on me.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.800
You're a shady fat gentleman.

08:48.800 --> 08:52.240
You're both blatantly sketchy and obviously like Cheetos.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.360
You love food.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.160
You love food.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.080
When I got there, this is not a joke.

08:56.080 --> 09:00.800
When I got there, the hood of the car was open and all the tires were off of it.

09:00.800 --> 09:04.000
And there was a guy in a hat trying to charge the battery.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.320
I'll take it.

09:06.320 --> 09:07.120
There's somebody like that.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.160
They're not trying to pull a fat.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.400
They're like, listen, you get what you get, you know?

09:10.400 --> 09:10.960
Yeah.

09:10.960 --> 09:11.680
It is what it is.

09:12.400 --> 09:18.240
Is there some kind of event that you could stage that would strengthen your bargaining position?

09:19.520 --> 09:20.960
Like a hostage crisis?

09:20.960 --> 09:25.040
Well, I'm saying like a mugging or like a hostage crisis.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.800
You want to become the community darling.

09:27.360 --> 09:27.760
Yeah.

09:27.760 --> 09:33.760
No one would rip off Little Rick, a mugging victim.

09:33.760 --> 09:34.480
Little Rick.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.280
Little Rick might hurt you.

09:35.280 --> 09:39.920
As you're walking across the street to the lot, you like save a kid from getting hit by a car.

09:39.920 --> 09:40.480
Yeah.

09:40.480 --> 09:40.880
Okay.

09:40.880 --> 09:41.360
Yeah.

09:41.360 --> 09:45.200
And you become like the light on the hill for your whole city.

09:45.200 --> 09:45.440
Yeah.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.920
Who's going to rip that guy off?

09:47.920 --> 09:48.640
An asshole.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.560
That's how he's going to rip Little Rick off.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.480
He's the light that got us through the depression.

09:52.480 --> 09:57.200
Is there a way that we can get this guy a car for free?

09:57.840 --> 09:58.960
Yeah, that's easy.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.320
Kickstarter.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.520
Just go on Kickstarter.com and say, hey, help me buy a car.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.280
And then the payoff is I'll give you rides whenever you want for your rides.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.080
That's great.

10:12.080 --> 10:15.600
If you donate a hundred bucks, I will take you to the airport.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.560
Don't you worry about it.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.160
It's like a limited number of rides.

10:18.160 --> 10:23.040
Like for a hundred dollars at some point in your life, you're going to need a ride.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.600
And maybe that person is not going to drive there,

10:25.600 --> 10:29.120
but they'll call someone they know or maybe get you a taxi.

10:29.120 --> 10:29.360
Yeah.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.560
Are you planning on flying into Boise, Idaho anytime soon?

10:32.560 --> 10:34.080
If so, I will pick you up.

10:34.080 --> 10:34.480
I will pick you up.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.600
No questions asked.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.920
I have a Toyota Corolla now, or I will.

10:37.920 --> 10:38.720
Give me a hundo.

10:40.080 --> 10:43.520
With your help, we can all own this car, by which I mean me.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.120
I like that.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.880
Or maybe you're feeling really generous.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.320
I'll name it after you.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.560
Donate 500 or more.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.760
I will name the car after you.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.520
There are five of this gift.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.880
So the car will have five names.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.040
My car is like the arcade fire.

11:00.720 --> 11:01.920
So many different names in there.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.280
Here's my bargaining.

11:07.840 --> 11:08.560
Go early.

11:08.560 --> 11:09.680
Go crazy.

11:09.680 --> 11:13.040
Just tell them, hey, I'm not going to pay you more than $17 for this car.

11:13.040 --> 11:17.120
And let them know that you're not coherent.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.360
Oh, what if you just said, I will pay nothing for this car?

11:21.360 --> 11:23.120
Instead of low balling, just no balling.

11:23.120 --> 11:23.840
No ball them.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.200
It's like, nope.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.080
But I still want it.

11:28.080 --> 11:32.400
Last time I tried to negotiate with a car guy, my wife accused me of no balling.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.400
I bought a car from a credit union.

11:40.400 --> 11:45.840
And I've never had to haggle with a man for something that's going to be as ubiquitous

11:45.840 --> 11:47.040
in my life as an automobile.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.360
Is it something that still really happens?

11:49.360 --> 11:51.360
I feel like in this age of Yelp-

11:51.360 --> 11:51.920
You know what?

11:51.920 --> 11:54.640
I bought my car rebuilt, Griffin, the zombie car.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.000
Yeah, I remember.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.920
We knocked $1,000 off of it.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.840
And it was already only like $5,000.

12:00.400 --> 12:04.000
That must make you feel great, but I feel like that's the exception to the rule.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.680
In this age of Skype and Yelp and eBay,

12:07.680 --> 12:11.920
why can't I just internet a car and not have to worry about-

12:11.920 --> 12:15.760
I can comparison shop on the internet.

12:15.760 --> 12:19.440
I was watching TV the other day, and Christian Slater told me about one of those places.

12:20.480 --> 12:26.720
But see, I feel like I'm being fucked by internet in that occasion, which is way more raw

12:27.280 --> 12:28.560
than being fucked by a man.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.120
Right.

12:29.120 --> 12:29.920
Uh-huh.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.600
Well, Phil, here's my advice, because this is what I would do.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.360
Take my dad with you.

12:35.360 --> 12:35.860
Okay.

12:35.860 --> 12:39.940
Take Clint McElroy with you, and have him negotiate for you.

12:39.940 --> 12:41.140
Have him be your proxy.

12:41.140 --> 12:45.700
Can we rent our dad out for situations where you need a dad?

12:45.700 --> 12:49.060
And let me be clear, you need a dad when you're car shopping.

12:49.060 --> 12:49.560
Uh-huh.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.500
Rental dad.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.340
Gots to have a dad in your pocket.

12:53.380 --> 12:55.300
Hold on, what about my daddy?

12:55.300 --> 12:57.060
That's the name of the business, dad in your pocket.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.780
That's also another good-

12:59.780 --> 13:03.380
If you ask your friends and family if they know somebody who sells cars,

13:03.380 --> 13:07.140
who presumably won't flip you over and just fuck you dry.

13:07.140 --> 13:09.140
Just right there on the hood of the car!

13:09.140 --> 13:11.140
Just like you're in a Poison music video.

13:12.260 --> 13:13.940
This is uncomfortable for me.

13:13.940 --> 13:18.420
You know a good bargaining technique if you're uncomfortable with the whole idea, like myself,

13:20.180 --> 13:25.620
tell them that your financier, whoever they may be, the bank or the whatever,

13:25.620 --> 13:27.780
won't give you as much as they're asking.

13:27.780 --> 13:28.580
That's a good one.

13:28.580 --> 13:31.540
Because then you decide how much you want to pay for it.

13:31.540 --> 13:34.580
And say, listen, the most they're willing to give me is this.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.180
Can we work this out?

13:36.180 --> 13:38.260
Can we do this, Price?

13:38.260 --> 13:39.140
I like that.

13:39.140 --> 13:41.860
What about just giving them the old silent treatment?

13:43.860 --> 13:48.180
Hey, uh, uh, Dave, there's been a guy standing out in the lot,

13:48.180 --> 13:50.820
staring at that Subaru for the past two days.

13:50.820 --> 13:53.780
He's got snow and a sparrow on his shoulder.

13:53.780 --> 13:56.020
I've tried to talk to him like eight times.

13:56.020 --> 14:00.100
He just looks at me like some sort of weird statue from the movie.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.420
Some sort of weird statue from Labyrinth.

14:02.420 --> 14:03.700
I think we should cut him a deal.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.300
Can we just give him that car for free?

14:06.260 --> 14:07.620
Can we just give him the car?

14:07.620 --> 14:08.660
I hate that Subaru.

14:10.740 --> 14:12.260
I've never liked it being here.

14:12.260 --> 14:13.540
Drive it off the lot.

14:13.540 --> 14:15.060
Get it off the lot, Dave.

14:15.060 --> 14:18.260
Guys, last night, I bit a child.

14:21.540 --> 14:26.820
I have one employee, a young woman, who is kind of a counterculture hippie type.

14:26.820 --> 14:29.380
She's a great employee.

14:29.380 --> 14:33.700
But on warm days, she can have a pretty intense body odor.

14:34.260 --> 14:35.940
She is not dirty.

14:35.940 --> 14:39.300
So I assume she either uses no deodorant or some bullshit crystal thing.

14:41.140 --> 14:43.860
I feel like it needs to be addressed,

14:43.860 --> 14:48.420
but I'm not sure how to raise the issue without making her feel like she's in trouble

14:48.420 --> 14:50.980
or like she's gross or like I'm an asshole.

14:50.980 --> 14:53.060
That's from willing to be an asshole.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.860
If you want a practical solution,

14:55.860 --> 14:59.380
you could try to get an office conversation going between the two of you

14:59.380 --> 15:01.220
about everyone's favorite brand of deodorant.

15:02.260 --> 15:07.060
That could make for an awkward way of bringing up the issue.

15:07.060 --> 15:08.980
I use Mitchum crystals.

15:10.020 --> 15:11.060
Who's up with Mitchum?

15:11.060 --> 15:11.780
Anybody?

15:11.780 --> 15:16.100
You just, you hold them, you hold them like a foot out from your pit

15:16.100 --> 15:17.780
and it just absorbs all this tink away.

15:18.580 --> 15:19.780
And your bad vibes.

15:19.780 --> 15:20.660
And your bad vibes.

15:20.660 --> 15:21.380
Get them out.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.780
I think this is one of those situations where

15:23.780 --> 15:25.460
you should just say it.

15:25.460 --> 15:27.780
You're a boss, you're in a professional setting.

15:27.780 --> 15:30.500
She's got a job and you should just be like,

15:30.500 --> 15:35.060
hey, I'm telling you this as a boss, you stink.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.540
My employee stink ratio is 100%

15:37.540 --> 15:40.260
because you're my only employee and you stink.

15:40.260 --> 15:41.940
All the people who work at my business stink.

15:42.820 --> 15:46.500
You know, it's, the thing is if she's not,

15:46.500 --> 15:48.660
if she smells bad, I feel like in this day and age,

15:48.660 --> 15:52.100
if you smell bad, it's not because, it's because of a choice.

15:52.100 --> 15:55.380
You've decided to smell bad, which is not cool for anybody.

15:55.380 --> 15:56.740
But I know they got chemicals in them,

15:56.740 --> 16:01.220
but I'm sure Tom the Maine makes a deodorant you can use.

16:01.220 --> 16:05.300
Yeah, Burt's Bees, Burt's Bees stink wax.

16:06.180 --> 16:08.420
Burt's B-O, I look at her and say,

16:08.420 --> 16:10.260
you don't want to be like Matthew McConaughey, do you?

16:10.260 --> 16:11.140
I don't think so.

16:12.740 --> 16:15.140
Can I give you the actual real answer to this question?

16:15.140 --> 16:15.620
Yeah.

16:15.620 --> 16:17.140
You're not gonna say, God, you're not.

16:17.140 --> 16:18.180
You're gonna live with that.

16:18.180 --> 16:20.180
And if someone comes into your business

16:20.180 --> 16:22.340
and they look at her and they say,

16:22.340 --> 16:24.980
hey, your employee smells bad, you say, you tell them.

16:24.980 --> 16:26.580
How exactly do you bring that up?

16:26.580 --> 16:29.780
Hey, hey, it smells like a modest Yahoo concert in here.

16:29.780 --> 16:33.460
Do you have a friend or cousin or brother

16:33.460 --> 16:36.500
that's an amateur actor that could dress as a delivery man

16:36.980 --> 16:38.740
and come in with a package and just be like,

16:38.740 --> 16:42.900
woo, you stink, and then you jump to the defense

16:42.900 --> 16:45.540
of this person, like, she's made a choice to stink.

16:45.540 --> 16:46.740
She wants to stink.

16:46.740 --> 16:49.940
I've got a delivery of truth here, C-O-D-U.

16:50.820 --> 16:52.100
And that way you didn't bring it up,

16:52.100 --> 16:53.460
but you started the dialogue.

16:54.420 --> 16:57.940
I think a dialogue is essential, no matter what.

16:57.940 --> 16:59.220
Well, if you have this other person,

16:59.220 --> 17:00.820
there's a tri-a-log at that point.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.060
And one person's an actor.

17:03.060 --> 17:04.420
Oh, you only have one employee,

17:04.420 --> 17:05.620
so what if you went up to her and said,

17:05.620 --> 17:06.900
hey, have you noticed how that girl

17:06.900 --> 17:08.340
in our department really smells?

17:08.340 --> 17:08.840
Yeah.

17:12.340 --> 17:14.660
Have you noticed how ingratia smells really bad?

17:14.660 --> 17:16.900
Have you noticed how ingratia smells really bad?

17:18.500 --> 17:19.700
But my name's ingratia.

17:19.700 --> 17:20.260
Oh, that's weird.

17:20.980 --> 17:23.380
Can you throw some misdirection down

17:23.380 --> 17:25.540
and wait for somebody to come into your store,

17:25.540 --> 17:27.220
which, if she smells this bad,

17:27.220 --> 17:28.900
is not gonna keep happening for much longer.

17:29.540 --> 17:30.900
And when that person leaves, be like,

17:30.900 --> 17:33.700
man, he smelled like body odor really strong.

17:33.700 --> 17:35.060
And then just constantly throughout the day,

17:35.060 --> 17:39.700
like, man, that man's body odor stink is just sticking around.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.660
That act could go on for weeks.

17:42.660 --> 17:45.540
Like, I have to call a fucking exorcist

17:46.100 --> 17:47.780
to get that man's smell out of here.

17:48.740 --> 17:49.860
The other thing is,

17:52.500 --> 17:53.220
scentsy, man.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.940
You call my girl Christy,

17:55.940 --> 17:58.420
she's gonna set you up with a scentsy burner,

17:59.460 --> 18:00.580
get you some wafers,

18:00.580 --> 18:02.900
so you get something real nice to melt in there.

18:02.900 --> 18:05.540
What scent wafers are you using this week?

18:05.540 --> 18:06.040
Me?

18:06.580 --> 18:10.260
I'm using Hide the Hippie and My Dear Watson.

18:10.260 --> 18:12.660
They're my two favorite flavors.

18:12.660 --> 18:15.620
Cloves and cinnamon, and forget she's there.

18:15.620 --> 18:18.260
Those two wafers are the two wafers I'm using.

18:19.940 --> 18:21.380
Uh, I don't mean to,

18:22.020 --> 18:24.500
I don't, I don't want to sound sexist

18:24.500 --> 18:26.260
or set a double standard or something,

18:26.260 --> 18:29.780
but ladies, you are not allowed to smell bad.

18:30.820 --> 18:31.300
You know what?

18:31.300 --> 18:32.900
It makes me so uncomfortable.

18:32.900 --> 18:35.300
Everyone, everyone, you're not allowed to smell bad.

18:35.300 --> 18:35.460
Yeah.

18:35.460 --> 18:36.980
It makes everyone uncomfortable.

18:36.980 --> 18:37.300
You're right.

18:37.300 --> 18:40.420
Because then everyone knows and no one's saying anything,

18:40.420 --> 18:43.060
and that is the recipe for an awkward situation.

18:43.060 --> 18:46.660
But if a, if a dude sitting next to me on a bus smells bad,

18:46.660 --> 18:48.980
I'm like, oh man, that dude smells bad.

18:48.980 --> 18:49.700
What a bummer.

18:49.700 --> 18:50.900
But if a lady sits down,

18:50.900 --> 18:56.020
a pretty free-spirited lady sits down next to me

18:56.020 --> 18:58.180
and she smells bad from her armpits,

18:58.900 --> 19:00.980
I, I don't just say, oh, there's a,

19:00.980 --> 19:02.260
there's a lady who smells bad.

19:02.260 --> 19:03.060
It's like, what?

19:03.780 --> 19:05.540
You messed with the whole image at that point.

19:06.100 --> 19:06.980
Mm-hmm.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.260
You're throwing Griffin off.

19:08.260 --> 19:10.740
Are hippies walking around thinking like they gotta get,

19:11.380 --> 19:13.620
like they want to get down with people who smell bad?

19:13.620 --> 19:14.260
Is that the thing?

19:14.260 --> 19:15.540
Like, do they like that smell more?

19:15.540 --> 19:15.700
Like their musk?

19:15.700 --> 19:16.740
I like your musk.

19:16.740 --> 19:16.980
Yeah.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.660
Your musk is so natural.

19:18.660 --> 19:19.060
This is me.

19:19.060 --> 19:20.020
I love it.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.140
You know what you're smelling?

19:21.140 --> 19:21.940
Me.

19:21.940 --> 19:22.500
That's me.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.420
That's what I am and smelling like.

19:24.420 --> 19:25.940
That's why I like Austin so much,

19:25.940 --> 19:27.780
is because there are a lot of hippies here,

19:27.780 --> 19:30.180
but it gets to be about 108 degrees.

19:31.620 --> 19:33.460
And they know, they know,

19:33.460 --> 19:35.860
like they are like, oh, I'm going to put deodorant on.

19:35.860 --> 19:37.460
Like it's against everything I believe in,

19:37.460 --> 19:40.020
but it's 108 goddamn degrees outside.

19:40.020 --> 19:41.780
I can't do that to another person.

19:41.780 --> 19:42.340
But hold on.

19:42.340 --> 19:43.940
But just to get back to this guy's question,

19:43.940 --> 19:45.620
we all agree that as a boss,

19:45.620 --> 19:47.060
he's perfectly within his rights.

19:47.060 --> 19:47.380
Yeah.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.860
So hey, you fucking, you fucking smell bad.

19:49.860 --> 19:50.100
Put deodorant on.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.060
You are my employee.

19:51.060 --> 19:52.660
I pay you and you smell like deodorant.

19:52.660 --> 19:54.180
Put on deodorant or I'll fire you.

19:54.820 --> 19:55.140
Okay.

19:56.180 --> 19:57.300
Don't do it in person.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.660
Give her an employee review

19:59.540 --> 20:01.700
and give personal hygiene a negative four.

20:02.260 --> 20:03.460
If she asks what this is about,

20:03.460 --> 20:06.340
say, what do you think it's about, Ingracia?

20:06.340 --> 20:08.580
You smell like Calamity Cafe.

20:08.580 --> 20:09.540
Get out of here.

20:09.540 --> 20:11.940
Or what about there's a fruit basket with a note on it?

20:11.940 --> 20:14.100
Like for the smelliest kid in the office.

20:14.100 --> 20:14.340
Yeah.

20:14.900 --> 20:16.500
I'm not sure that that would be.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.620
Yeah, because that's not very nice,

20:17.620 --> 20:18.660
but you get a fruit basket.

20:18.660 --> 20:20.980
It's the only way.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.340
That'll help all the hurt go away.

20:22.340 --> 20:24.180
It's going to soften the blow.

20:24.180 --> 20:24.740
Like, what?

20:24.740 --> 20:26.100
I smell grapes.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.060
That's good, Travis.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.660
Give the bad news a chocolate coating.

20:28.660 --> 20:34.100
Say, I'm giving you a bonus for smelling really bad.

20:34.100 --> 20:38.020
An extra $5 a week to buy deodorant, you smell-o.

20:38.020 --> 20:38.260
Yeah.

20:38.260 --> 20:40.820
I'm running you to chief smell-o, smell-o.

20:42.020 --> 20:43.060
Get out of here.

20:43.060 --> 20:45.700
Is it possible that she does wear deodorant,

20:45.700 --> 20:48.580
but she just, she's just rank.

20:49.380 --> 20:49.940
Oh, God.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.900
What if it is like a serious medical condition she has

20:52.900 --> 20:55.380
and you're like, hey, why don't you wear deodorant, hippie?

20:55.380 --> 20:57.780
And she's like, I actually have medical strength.

20:57.780 --> 20:59.780
I have prescription deodorant.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.380
I have prescription deodorant.

21:02.660 --> 21:04.420
It's a problem I've dealt with my entire life.

21:04.420 --> 21:05.860
Thank you so much for bringing it up.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.940
I use, I use Old Spice RX.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.180
It's strong enough.

21:12.180 --> 21:15.300
I even had to, I had to fork out extra for New Spice.

21:15.300 --> 21:16.180
It's strong enough.

21:17.380 --> 21:18.660
It's strong enough for a man

21:19.220 --> 21:21.220
and also strong enough for a woman

21:21.220 --> 21:24.100
with a horrible genetic predisposition

21:24.100 --> 21:25.620
to producing sweat from there.

21:25.620 --> 21:26.900
I had to go out and buy the deodorant

21:26.900 --> 21:28.100
that's strong enough for a bear.

21:32.260 --> 21:34.500
Griffin, how about you treat us to a Yahoo?

21:34.500 --> 21:34.820
Sure.

21:36.980 --> 21:40.100
This one, this one was sent in by Krista Whalen.

21:40.100 --> 21:40.820
Thank you, Krista.

21:40.820 --> 21:41.700
It's by Yahoo!

21:41.700 --> 21:41.860
Hey, Krista.

21:41.860 --> 21:45.540
It's her user, Mr. Toucan, who asks,

21:47.300 --> 21:49.220
what if everything was shaped like a penis?

21:51.860 --> 21:54.820
What if everything in the world was shaped like a penis?

21:54.820 --> 21:58.500
Buildings, buses, cars, shoes, fridges, etc.

21:58.500 --> 21:59.460
Would women like that?

22:03.620 --> 22:05.140
I have news for this guy.

22:05.140 --> 22:07.220
Maybe you haven't looked at a skyline recently.

22:07.220 --> 22:09.300
Everything is shaped like a penis.

22:09.860 --> 22:11.460
What's a man's world?

22:12.660 --> 22:15.620
Penis has a tiny radio antenna coming out of the top of it.

22:15.620 --> 22:17.300
So that's, yes.

22:17.300 --> 22:17.460
Right.

22:18.340 --> 22:19.220
I would like to-

22:19.220 --> 22:20.660
To pick up all the vibes the ladies-

22:20.660 --> 22:22.340
I would like to hear this guy's question

22:22.340 --> 22:26.420
and as if he and his friends often like use the phrase,

22:26.980 --> 22:29.620
you know, everything's shaped like a penis.

22:29.620 --> 22:31.060
And then he's like, what if everything was shaped like a penis?

22:31.060 --> 22:32.580
What if literally everything?

22:32.580 --> 22:35.780
What if I was reading this question off a penis-shaped computer?

22:35.780 --> 22:39.780
That's just not the, that's not the best viewing experience, I feel like.

22:39.780 --> 22:40.500
Yeah, no, you-

22:40.500 --> 22:42.660
Also, how would you give directions to anybody?

22:43.700 --> 22:46.420
Just turn left at the penis thing.

22:46.420 --> 22:48.020
I'll meet you by the cock.

22:48.020 --> 22:49.700
Like, I don't know.

22:49.700 --> 22:52.180
I don't know which one, because everything.

22:52.180 --> 22:52.660
You're shaped like a penis.

22:52.660 --> 22:54.020
No, no, the veiny one.

22:54.020 --> 22:54.260
Yeah.

22:55.460 --> 22:58.660
I think my favorite misconception about this

22:58.660 --> 23:00.500
is that women are walking around every day

23:00.500 --> 23:02.420
wishing everything was shaped like a penis.

23:03.220 --> 23:06.420
Man, I sure wish I could see some penis-shaped things today.

23:06.420 --> 23:06.660
Right.

23:07.540 --> 23:10.100
If only this cell phone was shaped like a penis.

23:10.820 --> 23:13.140
Well, this dog biscuit was shaped like a penis.

23:13.140 --> 23:15.300
Although I bet there are probably some angry women somewhere

23:15.300 --> 23:17.060
that have penis-shaped dog biscuits.

23:17.060 --> 23:23.780
But, you know, it would help to lend just an extra air of whimsy to the poster for Shaft.

23:23.780 --> 23:27.140
Just think, wow, that's a ex-

23:27.140 --> 23:28.900
They went really with the extra mile.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.460
But this man wasn't thinking laterally.

23:32.260 --> 23:32.820
Laterally?

23:32.820 --> 23:34.500
He wasn't thinking about-

23:34.500 --> 23:36.500
He wasn't thinking across all the different possibilities.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.020
You've got to think about the big picture.

23:38.020 --> 23:39.620
We're talking about literature.

23:40.260 --> 23:44.500
We're talking about trying to read a book, but the pages are in the shapes of dicks.

23:44.500 --> 23:44.740
Right.

23:44.740 --> 23:48.340
So you get like two words, three words, three words, three words,

23:48.340 --> 23:49.620
and then like 10 words.

23:49.620 --> 23:50.820
This is the balls.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.300
What if this was like a fucking Twilight Zone episode

23:53.300 --> 23:55.380
and even the words were shaped like dicks?

23:55.380 --> 23:56.580
Travis, this is every-

23:57.300 --> 24:01.060
We could invent a new language where every character was a dick.

24:01.060 --> 24:05.300
So you're saying like the book too would be shaped like a penis, you mean?

24:05.300 --> 24:06.180
That's what I'm saying.

24:06.180 --> 24:10.580
It would be like eat, pray, love, hide it when the kids come in the room.

24:10.580 --> 24:14.260
So basically what it is, is this is a guy who has spent his life,

24:14.260 --> 24:17.380
I don't know, killing dicks or something or just like making fun of dicks,

24:17.380 --> 24:19.540
and then he wakes up one day and he's shaped like a dick

24:19.540 --> 24:21.780
and everything's shaped like a dick and the books are shaped like dicks

24:21.780 --> 24:24.660
and the words are shaped like dicks and like his breakfast is shaped like dicks

24:24.660 --> 24:26.020
and he's just in the middle of town square

24:26.660 --> 24:29.620
spinning around the dick-shaped town square screaming dicks.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.940
Yeah, and then a dick-shaped ghost comes up and is like,

24:31.940 --> 24:33.780
shouldn't have killed all those dicks.

24:33.780 --> 24:34.100
What?

24:35.060 --> 24:36.340
What are you talking about?

24:36.980 --> 24:37.780
Killing dicks?

24:39.460 --> 24:44.020
And then it pulls out two vagina-shaped scientists saying shut it down.

24:44.020 --> 24:44.520
Yeah.

24:46.260 --> 24:48.020
That's my favorite episode.

24:48.020 --> 24:48.900
Twist.

24:48.900 --> 24:52.500
You know, do you know that later Nimoy directed that episode?

24:52.500 --> 24:53.460
A little trivia.

24:53.460 --> 24:54.340
I could tell.

24:54.340 --> 24:58.660
It had a lot of his signature signatures on it.

24:58.660 --> 24:59.620
A lot of signature dicks.

24:59.620 --> 25:01.700
A lot of his signature dicks in it.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.260
A dick-shaped lens on a dick-shaped TV?

25:04.260 --> 25:05.060
Is that what we're doing?

25:05.060 --> 25:06.740
Is that a dick-shaped filter?

25:06.740 --> 25:07.780
I could really tell.

25:07.780 --> 25:11.380
Put it on channel dick dick because the numbers are dicks too, people.

25:11.380 --> 25:12.020
Oh God.

25:12.020 --> 25:18.340
Um, I think that this man's main point is, um, is fallacious.

25:18.340 --> 25:22.900
And that is that, uh, women would like it because I think that after a while,

25:24.020 --> 25:27.540
it wouldn't be like, if every letter in the alphabet looked like a dick,

25:28.180 --> 25:33.300
then when I got a special woman in the bedroom and showed her my treasure,

25:33.300 --> 25:34.500
she'd be like, yep.

25:34.500 --> 25:38.740
Like, what if everything was dick-shaped except dicks?

25:38.740 --> 25:39.300
Yeah.

25:39.300 --> 25:43.140
And your dick was shaped like a sitar maybe or, uh, another-

25:43.140 --> 25:45.220
Sitars kind of look like dicks a little bit.

25:45.220 --> 25:46.740
What if it was like, you could choose it.

25:46.740 --> 25:49.860
Like, you know, maybe you want it to look like, you know, a clownfish.

25:49.860 --> 25:50.180
I don't know.

25:50.180 --> 25:50.660
It's up to you.

25:51.220 --> 25:51.700
Yeah.

25:51.700 --> 25:52.340
Maybe not.

25:52.340 --> 25:54.020
Wait, are they not supposed to look like clownfish?

25:55.620 --> 25:57.620
I have to go to the doctors.

25:57.620 --> 25:58.660
All the doctors now.

25:58.660 --> 26:06.180
Doctor, doctor, my, uh, my treasure looks like Nemo and it's not supposed to.

26:06.180 --> 26:10.660
Can you, um, use all your dick tools that are all shaped like dicks?

26:10.660 --> 26:11.780
Get it from your dick-shaped bag.

26:13.380 --> 26:15.860
Give me the 916th dick, nurse.

26:17.860 --> 26:19.620
God, surgery would be awful, wouldn't it?

26:19.620 --> 26:20.260
Give me that super sharp dick.

26:20.260 --> 26:21.620
No, the Phillips head dick.

26:24.340 --> 26:25.620
This is a flathead dick.

26:26.660 --> 26:27.540
Like Dick Tracy.

26:29.060 --> 26:29.380
What?

26:30.580 --> 26:30.900
Gum shoes.

26:30.900 --> 26:33.060
All the Dick Tracy villains would be dick-shaped.

26:33.620 --> 26:34.420
Dick head.

26:34.420 --> 26:37.300
That's why this is my Rose gallery.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.180
Dick head.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.060
Penis face.

26:41.220 --> 26:42.340
Rod pants.

26:42.340 --> 26:46.340
Like this is and mumbles.

26:46.340 --> 26:46.900
Mumbles.

26:47.780 --> 26:52.900
This is, uh, I hope that this is the first episode our grandmother listens to.

26:52.900 --> 26:54.660
Yeah, I heard what you said.

26:55.300 --> 26:56.660
I heard those things.

26:56.660 --> 26:59.140
I heard those things about the dick, the dick world.

26:59.140 --> 27:00.500
Thanksgiving is ruined, boys.

27:00.500 --> 27:03.140
That's my favorite series of fantasy novels.

27:03.140 --> 27:04.100
Right?

27:04.100 --> 27:04.980
Dick world?

27:04.980 --> 27:05.220
Yeah.

27:06.420 --> 27:08.900
Yeah, I really liked the most recent one.

27:11.780 --> 27:12.820
I don't have a punchline.

27:15.380 --> 27:17.940
Which is a great sign that I need to move on to the next question.

27:18.820 --> 27:23.220
One of my best friends moved back to town in order to switch colleges,

27:23.780 --> 27:26.500
and he has been looking for a job ever since.

27:26.500 --> 27:30.100
I recently got my interview at the store I work at, and he landed the job.

27:30.100 --> 27:31.940
It's just a crappy retail job.

27:31.940 --> 27:35.860
When I told my girlfriend this, she voiced her concern that interacting with my friend

27:35.860 --> 27:39.780
in a work environment might adversely affect our relationship.

27:40.740 --> 27:42.660
Now I feel like I just sabotaged my friendship.

27:43.220 --> 27:44.420
Should I not worry about it?

27:44.420 --> 27:48.260
Or should I tell my boss my friend has a drug problem before he stops working?

27:48.260 --> 27:49.060
Help, brothers.

27:49.060 --> 27:51.380
That's friend of the financially flustered in Florida.

27:52.260 --> 27:54.020
Did your friend actually have a drug problem?

27:55.060 --> 27:57.060
Yeah, then it's just full disclosure.

27:57.060 --> 27:58.180
Yeah, then I mean.

27:58.180 --> 27:59.140
Do we need to have a talk?

27:59.140 --> 28:03.300
Well, I think it's fun.

28:04.340 --> 28:04.740
Yeah.

28:04.740 --> 28:08.820
Personally, I mean, I've had friends work at most every job that I've had,

28:08.820 --> 28:16.340
and it's nice to have somebody else you can chat about work with outside of the workplace.

28:16.340 --> 28:18.020
I don't think it's damaging at all, really.

28:18.660 --> 28:24.340
The only time that it ever affected me adversely is when I worked at Best Buy and I was,

28:24.340 --> 28:26.020
you know, I was trying to get promoted.

28:26.020 --> 28:29.780
I was trying to get that cheddar and I was taking it far too seriously.

28:30.340 --> 28:34.820
And I worked with my dear, dear friend Michael Bradbury, who is kind of a goofball.

28:35.460 --> 28:37.140
And people would constantly.

28:37.140 --> 28:37.780
Yeah, he is.

28:37.780 --> 28:38.900
He's a cat bird.

28:38.900 --> 28:42.260
And people would often my bosses would be like, Hey, where's Bradbury?

28:42.260 --> 28:44.180
He's three and a half hours late or whatever.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.060
And I don't know.

28:45.060 --> 28:46.100
I'm like, he's your friend.

28:47.140 --> 28:48.580
Then then it was kind of a bummer.

28:48.580 --> 28:51.380
You wouldn't throw him under the bus for corporate gain?

28:51.380 --> 28:51.940
Fuck no.

28:52.740 --> 28:53.860
I'm for Best Buy.

28:53.860 --> 28:57.060
He's my BFF.

28:57.060 --> 29:01.860
I've gotten many of many a friend hired at the institution I work with.

29:01.860 --> 29:04.100
There is always the danger.

29:04.100 --> 29:06.100
I mean, I think that's the bigger worry than.

29:07.300 --> 29:14.180
I think that's a bigger worry than, you know, your friendship going to pot is your boss.

29:14.180 --> 29:16.900
You know, the first time they fuck up, your boss coming to you and saying,

29:16.900 --> 29:20.820
Hey, you're so your friend is working out really bad.

29:20.820 --> 29:22.740
I don't like how they stock anything.

29:22.740 --> 29:26.340
Your friend's body odor is boomastic.

29:26.340 --> 29:27.300
Can you talk to you?

29:27.300 --> 29:28.100
Oh, my God.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.700
Your big shaped friend.

29:29.700 --> 29:31.700
I got the answer, guys.

29:31.700 --> 29:33.780
The guy needs to hire someone else.

29:34.820 --> 29:38.900
He needs to hire a second employee and then fire them for being rude and commenting on

29:38.900 --> 29:39.700
her body odor.

29:40.900 --> 29:44.180
Do you have a friend or cousin that's an amateur actor?

29:44.180 --> 29:45.220
Do you have a friend?

29:46.500 --> 29:48.740
Do you just have it has to be just an outspoken.

29:48.740 --> 29:50.580
Can you an outspoken person?

29:50.580 --> 29:53.140
Like you can get Jack to come.

29:53.140 --> 29:55.220
Can you hire Star Jones for a week?

29:56.260 --> 30:01.220
And if your friend is Star Jones, then I wouldn't worry too much about getting them hired because

30:01.220 --> 30:03.780
she's got enough charisma to light up a room.

30:03.780 --> 30:06.260
She's going to get to get on her own and there's not going to be any problems there.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.620
I've worked with my brother for four years.

30:10.660 --> 30:12.980
Yeah, well, we do it remotely, but still, yeah.

30:12.980 --> 30:14.980
Yeah, it's brought us together.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.100
I work with a lot of friends.

30:16.900 --> 30:19.700
You know, I don't think it's an inherent problem.

30:19.700 --> 30:24.980
I think I'm trying to see what the problem would be if you don't care about your job.

30:24.980 --> 30:28.340
If you care about your job, but you describe it as a crappy retail job.

30:28.340 --> 30:29.460
Like, what are you going to lose?

30:30.180 --> 30:32.980
You know, as long as you keep your head clear and you're like, this is my best friend.

30:32.980 --> 30:35.780
I'm just happy to get to like hang out with him at work.

30:35.780 --> 30:41.460
Also, if it's a crappy retail job and you have a new guy in there who's your buddy,

30:41.460 --> 30:47.700
then you have two people to plan Ocean's Eleven-esque heists with because that's the

30:47.700 --> 30:49.780
only reason people have retail jobs anymore, right?

30:49.780 --> 30:53.380
It's just, it's just to steal, just to steal, hand over.

30:53.380 --> 30:56.580
Yeah, I got fired for stealing at Blockbuster.

30:56.580 --> 30:58.420
Oh, please, please tell this story.

30:59.060 --> 30:59.560
What?

31:00.500 --> 31:02.180
You got to tell everyone what you stole.

31:02.180 --> 31:08.900
So I, things got really rugged towards the last few months of my tenure at Blockbuster.

31:09.460 --> 31:16.660
And you know how you can sell, you know, people have late fees and you can put on your computer

31:16.660 --> 31:22.580
and dismiss them, but you can do that with like, you could sell things to your account,

31:22.580 --> 31:22.820
right?

31:22.820 --> 31:26.500
So like if they didn't return the movie, you could sell the movie to their account

31:26.500 --> 31:30.980
and then it shows up like late fee basically and you clear the late fee and you can steal

31:30.980 --> 31:31.780
things that way.

31:31.780 --> 31:39.860
And the special edition of Fight Club came out and I sold it to my account and then I

31:39.860 --> 31:41.140
deleted my late fees.

31:41.140 --> 31:48.340
And as it turned out, that copy was the, the copy that I sold to my account was the boss's

31:48.340 --> 31:52.180
copy that he had reserved to buy himself.

31:52.180 --> 31:57.140
So what I had done was I had stolen my boss's copy of Fight Club.

31:57.140 --> 32:04.100
Now, I tell this story not to talk about my own failings as a human being because I think

32:04.100 --> 32:06.580
we've all got dark things in our past.

32:06.580 --> 32:07.080
Sure.

32:07.080 --> 32:13.940
I tell this story to demonstrate how little he really understood the concepts being espoused

32:13.940 --> 32:14.980
in Fight Club.

32:14.980 --> 32:18.500
He should have celebrated.

32:18.500 --> 32:24.660
I feel like a true fan would have really enjoyed what I was trying to do there.

32:24.660 --> 32:26.660
Can I ask, can I ask a question?

32:26.660 --> 32:27.460
Please, yeah.

32:27.460 --> 32:30.500
This whole scenario, it's very clever.

32:30.500 --> 32:35.740
Why didn't you just stick Fight Club down your pants and leave the store?

32:35.740 --> 32:46.860
Well, A, okay, A, cameras, B, I'm a husky guy, I don't have a lot of room in there.

32:47.980 --> 32:49.900
And that's first degree stealing.

32:49.900 --> 32:52.620
The thing is, that's first degree stealing, Griffin.

32:52.620 --> 32:55.740
Any Tom, Dick, or Harry can do that.

32:56.780 --> 32:59.900
This was Ocean's Eleven style stealing and I like it.

32:59.900 --> 33:05.340
Now, should I have sold it to an account that did not explicitly have my name on it?

33:05.340 --> 33:05.840
Maybe.

33:06.540 --> 33:08.540
That's quite a paper trail there, McElroy.

33:09.820 --> 33:11.340
Hindsight and all that.

33:11.340 --> 33:13.340
And you would have gotten away with it too.

33:13.340 --> 33:17.340
Well, no, if I'd had a best friend working there, they could have helped me plot through

33:17.340 --> 33:18.060
the details.

33:18.060 --> 33:23.660
They could have said like, hey, that belongs to Philip and he does not really understand

33:23.660 --> 33:24.220
the movie.

33:24.220 --> 33:25.260
He is your employer.

33:27.180 --> 33:31.580
You should remove the sticker that says this is stolen from the cassette tape.

33:31.580 --> 33:37.260
So, first day of your friend working this job, pull him into the back room and be like,

33:37.260 --> 33:39.820
listen, I hired you for one reason and one reason only.

33:39.820 --> 33:43.980
I got you this job so you could help me steal some movies and stuff.

33:43.980 --> 33:44.380
You're our man on the inside.

33:44.380 --> 33:48.380
We're taking this bathroom body works apart, piece by piece.

33:48.380 --> 33:52.780
I brought you here for one reason and one reason only so you can watch for the boss

33:52.780 --> 33:54.540
while I huff off the helium tank.

33:55.580 --> 33:57.900
That is another thing I used to do at Blockbuster.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.180
That is, I do not have a good defense for it.

34:01.180 --> 34:04.700
I thought that you-

34:04.700 --> 34:05.820
I was the watch guard.

34:05.820 --> 34:09.980
I should point out my friend Jimmy is the one who would get high and black out just

34:09.980 --> 34:11.420
in a big pile of MRAs.

34:14.540 --> 34:20.380
I always thought that the film that you acquired, which was your downfall, was Showgirls.

34:20.380 --> 34:21.740
I always thought that was the case.

34:22.380 --> 34:24.380
No, it was Fight Club, which makes the irony.

34:24.380 --> 34:31.420
I mean, I feel like if I walked out with Showgirls, I would have been embarrassed.

34:31.420 --> 34:34.380
But Fight Club, I feel like, what would Tyler Durden do?

34:35.500 --> 34:36.300
That was it.

34:36.300 --> 34:40.380
And by the way, I apparently bought into that mythos a little bit too much as a young man.

34:40.380 --> 34:41.820
I think we all did as young men.

34:41.820 --> 34:46.540
I remember watching that film and then I went and I got in a shower and I just turned the

34:46.540 --> 34:47.820
heat up as hot as it could go.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.260
Like, yeah, the pain is real.

34:49.260 --> 34:50.780
Like, it's not real.

34:52.380 --> 34:53.420
I mean, it is real.

34:53.420 --> 34:53.980
It just hurts.

34:53.980 --> 34:57.740
I watched that movie and then I got fired from my job at the dog kennel for stealing dogs.

34:57.740 --> 34:58.240
Yeah.

34:59.020 --> 34:59.260
No.

34:59.260 --> 35:00.780
You can put them down your pants, tough guy.

35:02.220 --> 35:08.140
You got fired from the dog kennel because you didn't want to clean out dog buttholes.

35:08.140 --> 35:09.900
I refuse to squeeze buttholes.

35:09.900 --> 35:12.380
I don't think that's a revolutionary concept.

35:12.380 --> 35:16.780
I thought I was taking a fucking stand being like, no, I will not squeeze that dog's butthole.

35:16.780 --> 35:18.300
This is like dog equal rights.

35:18.300 --> 35:22.220
I wouldn't want someone squeezing my butthole doing to others.

35:22.220 --> 35:23.420
Hey, there you go.

35:23.420 --> 35:25.980
Say, Ingracia, can you come into my office?

35:26.620 --> 35:31.100
I think you may need to go have your anal gland professionally squeezed because you do

35:31.100 --> 35:31.980
smell very bad.

35:31.980 --> 35:34.780
I believe something on you needs to be expressed.

35:37.900 --> 35:39.020
Don't do that.

35:39.020 --> 35:39.580
Don't do that.

35:39.580 --> 35:40.380
That won't work either.

35:40.380 --> 35:43.100
I'm pretty sure if you say that sentence to a woman, you go to jail.

35:45.020 --> 35:50.860
Hey, there's this girl I like at school and before she goes to her class, we usually hug.

35:50.860 --> 35:55.980
The problem is that when we hug, I usually have an increased amount of blood flow to

35:55.980 --> 35:57.500
my nether region.

35:57.500 --> 36:02.540
I am worried that she will feel it while we're hugging and end up thinking that I am perverted,

36:02.540 --> 36:04.140
but I can't really control it.

36:04.140 --> 36:10.620
Is there a way to stop my mini me from rising to the occasion as from concern in California?

36:10.620 --> 36:12.460
I wish we got more questions like that.

36:12.460 --> 36:14.060
I love this honesty.

36:14.060 --> 36:14.860
I can't.

36:14.860 --> 36:21.740
There were more ways to say this man had an erection without saying that he had an erection

36:21.740 --> 36:23.900
that made me so uncomfortable that I could count.

36:27.500 --> 36:28.540
Why are you hugging?

36:31.980 --> 36:33.820
That's the thing I can't get away from.

36:33.820 --> 36:37.900
You're sitting there and it's before school and she has to go to class so you hug goodbye?

36:40.380 --> 36:41.340
Why are you hugging?

36:41.340 --> 36:44.620
Travis, that's the most goddamn beautiful thing I've ever heard.

36:44.620 --> 36:45.820
I don't want to crush it.

36:47.340 --> 36:50.620
Is he an 80 year old man pretending to be a kid in school?

36:51.980 --> 36:54.460
That's a weird thing to do if it's just your friend.

36:54.460 --> 36:56.220
Is she your lady?

36:57.180 --> 37:03.260
You're making it sound like 8 o'clock, it's hug time, he says they usually hug.

37:04.780 --> 37:06.060
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday.

37:06.060 --> 37:08.300
He doesn't force her to do it if she's uncomfortable.

37:08.300 --> 37:16.220
Travis, if this is a thing that has happened before, you pop in an instant chubby in this

37:16.220 --> 37:21.260
embrace, an instant embrace chubby, and she keeps hugging you.

37:23.660 --> 37:25.420
Maybe your boner knows something she doesn't.

37:28.220 --> 37:30.780
Your boner is the only one thinking through this situation.

37:31.580 --> 37:34.540
I think it's time to show her the clown fish.

37:34.540 --> 37:41.100
Give her the old sitar, give her the sitar sighting.

37:42.300 --> 37:43.180
She deserves it.

37:46.300 --> 37:46.860
You know what?

37:47.660 --> 37:51.020
Boners are beautiful and that's a way of life, especially when you're in school.

37:51.020 --> 37:52.300
Just get the boner.

37:52.300 --> 37:53.660
I wish I could still get a boner.

37:58.940 --> 37:59.440
Nonsense.

38:00.940 --> 38:02.540
Instead of rubbing it in people's faces.

38:02.540 --> 38:07.260
Not sense the fire, as Justin enjoyed that feeling.

38:08.540 --> 38:10.540
Yeah, I can't get a boner anymore.

38:11.980 --> 38:16.380
Maybe, maybe just go for it, and next time you do it, just hug her real close.

38:16.380 --> 38:17.020
Here's the problem.

38:17.020 --> 38:18.540
Oh boy, you like that?

38:18.540 --> 38:18.940
That's good.

38:18.940 --> 38:21.020
That's not at all like sexual harassment.

38:21.020 --> 38:21.520
Nope.

38:23.420 --> 38:25.500
You get boners when you're in high school.

38:25.500 --> 38:26.540
They just happen.

38:26.540 --> 38:30.140
They, they, they apparate, like Harry Potter.

38:30.140 --> 38:32.940
You get assigned boners like you do a locker combination.

38:35.020 --> 38:44.300
I do enjoy though that we, I, why do we have classes in algebra two and trigonometry when

38:45.020 --> 38:47.340
hiding boners is not on the menu?

38:47.340 --> 38:48.460
And it should be.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.580
How to handle your boner.

38:51.820 --> 38:52.460
You do not.

38:53.180 --> 38:55.260
It was an elective for me, but I mean, I took it.

38:55.260 --> 38:56.380
I wasn't on that track, no.

38:57.820 --> 38:59.020
I had a home ec instead.

38:59.020 --> 39:00.140
I had cooking.

39:00.140 --> 39:04.460
I took hiding the boner AP, so I got college credit for it.

39:04.460 --> 39:05.180
That's nice.

39:05.180 --> 39:05.740
That's nice.

39:07.260 --> 39:08.860
I took how to cook with your boner.

39:09.420 --> 39:10.860
I just combined the two.

39:10.860 --> 39:12.460
It was a special track I created.

39:12.460 --> 39:13.420
Okay, double credit.

39:13.420 --> 39:14.060
Here's the deal.

39:16.860 --> 39:20.780
I think that what I said before, I'm sticking with.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.100
I think it's time for you to make a move.

39:23.100 --> 39:26.860
Either poop or get off the pot and tell this girl you're interested in it.

39:26.860 --> 39:28.620
Start using those boners for good.

39:28.620 --> 39:32.300
He doesn't necessarily have to be interested in her to get a boner.

39:32.300 --> 39:33.500
I got a boner.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.740
But he says there's this girl I like at school.

39:36.460 --> 39:37.100
He likes her.

39:37.660 --> 39:42.940
Yeah, I got boners every day in Spanish class in high school.

39:42.940 --> 39:45.820
And it wasn't because I had a busty teacher.

39:46.460 --> 39:47.820
But like apropos of nothing?

39:47.820 --> 39:51.020
Just the only thing I can think is that it's a romance language.

39:52.620 --> 39:56.460
And that fact in and of itself is enough to stiffen.

39:56.460 --> 40:00.940
But I say if he likes this girl, if he's hugging her and getting the bone,

40:00.940 --> 40:04.940
then he needs to be like, hey, let's go see a movie.

40:04.940 --> 40:11.020
Travis, he could have a binder resting on his lap and get a boner.

40:11.020 --> 40:13.020
It has nothing to do with him liking this girl.

40:13.020 --> 40:17.260
He likes having a warm, soft surface to press up against.

40:18.620 --> 40:19.820
I see what you're saying.

40:19.820 --> 40:22.140
But he needs one of those microwavable bean bags.

40:24.140 --> 40:25.820
He needs to desensitize himself.

40:25.820 --> 40:30.540
Yeah, he needs a sumo chair that he can really explore.

40:30.540 --> 40:33.580
He needs to explore his body on a sumo chair.

40:33.580 --> 40:34.700
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

40:35.820 --> 40:36.060
Yeah.

40:36.060 --> 40:37.340
Can I say Yahoo me?

40:38.060 --> 40:38.620
No.

40:38.620 --> 40:41.180
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield or Holifield.

40:41.180 --> 40:42.460
I haven't decided yet.

40:42.460 --> 40:43.020
It's by Yahoo.

40:44.380 --> 40:45.340
The time is coming up.

40:45.340 --> 40:46.620
The time is fast approaching.

40:46.620 --> 40:47.820
You need to make that decision.

40:47.820 --> 40:57.020
That's why Yahoo answers user Loser who asks, what insults have you called your pet?

40:57.020 --> 41:00.060
My uncle just called his kitten a dumb bitch whore.

41:02.380 --> 41:05.260
How have you or your loved ones insulted your pets?

41:05.260 --> 41:06.220
I love animals.

41:06.220 --> 41:07.420
I'm not mean to pets.

41:07.420 --> 41:10.460
I just think it's funny calling them names behind their backs when gossiping.

41:11.340 --> 41:12.060
Wait, what?

41:12.700 --> 41:13.820
Excuse me?

41:13.820 --> 41:15.260
Gossiping about the pets?

41:15.260 --> 41:19.180
Hey, have you noticed how fat Whiskers has been getting?

41:19.180 --> 41:22.620
Look at how trophy Whiskers smells like he has BO.

41:23.660 --> 41:24.620
Who's going to tell him?

41:25.820 --> 41:27.500
Using crystals Whiskers?

41:27.500 --> 41:33.260
I hear Professor Mittens will go down on any cat with just a little bit of nip.

41:33.980 --> 41:35.580
Yeah, all it takes.

41:36.140 --> 41:38.380
Hey, hey, hey, everybody.

41:38.940 --> 41:42.460
If you want to gossip to your cat or gossip about your pets,

41:42.460 --> 41:44.300
just do it to their goddamn faces.

41:44.300 --> 41:46.140
Yeah, you're stupid.

41:46.140 --> 41:48.380
Pringles, Pringles, you are a slut.

41:52.220 --> 41:52.940
Oh, God.

41:53.900 --> 41:56.540
Nobody likes you, Rufy.

41:57.340 --> 41:57.820
Rufy?

41:58.620 --> 41:59.500
Rufio?

41:59.500 --> 42:01.020
It's short for Rufio.

42:01.020 --> 42:01.500
Okay.

42:03.420 --> 42:07.580
Hey, Lord Barkington, mayor of Pubbyshire, come over here real quick.

42:09.500 --> 42:10.380
You're adopted.

42:10.380 --> 42:13.180
Oh, shit.

42:14.380 --> 42:16.220
Not that there's anything wrong with being adopted.

42:18.060 --> 42:19.580
Isn't every dog adopted?

42:20.780 --> 42:21.740
Some are birth dogs.

42:23.900 --> 42:25.980
Hey, Lord Edward Bark, get over here.

42:25.980 --> 42:26.700
You're a dick.

42:28.300 --> 42:28.940
I hate you.

42:30.220 --> 42:32.620
Why don't you just name your cat Fartface?

42:32.620 --> 42:33.340
They don't know.

42:33.340 --> 42:34.140
They'll answer to anything.

42:34.140 --> 42:35.020
They don't care.

42:35.020 --> 42:43.980
I wish I lived a life free of fear that was conducive to me calling other people's pets names.

42:44.940 --> 42:45.580
Oh, my.

42:46.620 --> 42:47.580
You know what I mean?

42:47.580 --> 42:53.020
Like, if I could just go to Justin's house and then go right, like, hey, hey, it's good to see you.

42:53.580 --> 42:54.220
Oh, yeah, I know.

42:54.220 --> 42:55.420
I haven't seen you in so long.

42:56.060 --> 42:57.260
What's up, you fat slut?

43:00.700 --> 43:03.900
Here's the catch about gossiping about your pets.

43:03.900 --> 43:05.980
First off, that's something a crazy person does.

43:06.620 --> 43:15.260
More importantly, though, what burn are you going to lay on your cat that is equal to

43:17.580 --> 43:19.660
scooping their poop?

43:21.420 --> 43:23.100
Like, oh, yeah, pretty good one.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.380
Pretty good one, Justin.

43:24.380 --> 43:28.300
Did you want to go scoop some of my feces out of sand?

43:28.300 --> 43:30.460
Because that's what you're doing this afternoon.

43:30.460 --> 43:33.740
Me? Me? I'm going to lay on this chair and shed.

43:34.380 --> 43:39.100
What I do is I routinely withhold food from my cat.

43:39.100 --> 43:41.340
Not forever, just for like a half hour.

43:41.340 --> 43:43.980
Just like a half hour, an hour when I know she's really hungry.

43:44.700 --> 43:48.060
And then I tell her that I don't want to feed her because she's getting fat.

43:50.220 --> 43:51.740
And then eventually I do feed her.

43:52.860 --> 43:55.980
But I do it saying, all right, if you want to get fat.

43:57.980 --> 44:00.140
You have a weird relationship, huh?

44:00.140 --> 44:02.060
Well, I don't want the cat to like me.

44:02.060 --> 44:03.340
I don't like the cat.

44:03.340 --> 44:04.460
It's Teresa's cat.

44:04.460 --> 44:05.740
I don't like you.

44:05.740 --> 44:08.140
You want the cat to be the greatest ballerina.

44:10.140 --> 44:12.060
Listen, she's got the skills.

44:12.060 --> 44:13.180
She's got the talent.

44:13.180 --> 44:14.700
She just needs the drive.

44:14.700 --> 44:16.700
That's what I'm here for, huh?

44:17.500 --> 44:20.620
Your apartment sounds like Guantanamo Bay for cats.

44:21.340 --> 44:25.020
She may not thank you someday, but the world will thank you.

44:27.180 --> 44:29.660
For giving the greatest cat ballerina.

44:29.660 --> 44:34.860
I am routinely also training my cat to make hilarious cat videos to the internet.

44:35.660 --> 44:37.660
It's basically like a boot camp for that.

44:37.660 --> 44:38.700
Can the cat upload them?

44:39.420 --> 44:40.060
Yeah.

44:40.060 --> 44:40.940
You guys know Maru?

44:40.940 --> 44:42.620
If she wants to get fed, she will.

44:42.620 --> 44:43.660
You guys know Maru?

44:44.460 --> 44:50.300
Maru was beaten to sleep every night as a baby, as a tiny cat, as a child.

44:50.860 --> 44:51.420
Child cat.

44:52.060 --> 44:52.860
It's a cat child.

44:56.060 --> 44:56.540
I hear.

44:56.540 --> 45:02.060
I hear she's a real bitch and a real dynamo in a sack.

45:03.740 --> 45:07.660
Here's my one problem with this, and we can make fun of this as much as we want.

45:10.460 --> 45:16.300
I can never shake the feeling that maybe, just maybe, that cat or dog that I'm making

45:16.300 --> 45:17.900
fun of is a witch's familiar.

45:17.900 --> 45:18.460
Yeah.

45:18.460 --> 45:21.900
Oh God, that's such a present problem today.

45:21.900 --> 45:22.860
I know.

45:22.860 --> 45:23.900
What if?

45:23.900 --> 45:24.460
What if?

45:24.460 --> 45:26.460
I'm like, get out of here, you fat, lazy bitch.

45:26.460 --> 45:26.700
Yeah.

45:27.340 --> 45:31.980
And then she goes back to her witch and I get cursed.

45:31.980 --> 45:33.660
Or what if she is a witch?

45:34.220 --> 45:35.100
That's what I'm saying.

45:35.100 --> 45:40.220
What if it's Kathy Najimy just transformed, made feline, and you made fun of her?

45:40.220 --> 45:43.020
Oh God, it's Sarah Jessica Parker, everyone duck.

45:43.020 --> 45:43.500
I'm sorry.

45:43.500 --> 45:44.860
No, wait a second.

45:45.980 --> 45:46.780
Is she a witch?

45:47.500 --> 45:49.260
Sarah Jessica, SJP?

45:49.260 --> 45:49.900
Yeah.

45:49.900 --> 45:52.780
SJP, Kathy Najimy, and Bette Midler.

45:52.780 --> 45:54.620
That's Team Hocus Pocus.

45:57.260 --> 45:59.260
That's my new bar trivia name.

46:00.300 --> 46:01.260
We're Team Pocus.

46:01.900 --> 46:06.220
I actually am feeling right now like Griffin has not seen the film Hocus Pocus.

46:06.220 --> 46:07.500
I think that's what we're getting at.

46:08.300 --> 46:10.540
Griffin, I need confirmation that you've seen Hocus Pocus.

46:10.540 --> 46:11.500
I've seen Hocus Pocus.

46:12.220 --> 46:13.100
What's the name of the cat?

46:14.860 --> 46:17.980
Welcome to our new show, Hocus Pocus Trivia.

46:17.980 --> 46:20.620
It's called Hocus Jocus.

46:20.620 --> 46:23.100
It's a comedy podcast about Hocus Pocus, the movie.

46:25.020 --> 46:29.340
I thought, and I was ready to go on this trip with you, Travis,

46:29.340 --> 46:32.700
that you were saying Sarah Jessica Parker is a literal witch.

46:34.300 --> 46:38.460
She has literal children's bones in her house that she uses to cast spells.

46:38.460 --> 46:41.180
Listen, I'm not ready to say that.

46:41.180 --> 46:45.580
I'm saying nobody can apparently prove that she doesn't cast the black art.

46:45.580 --> 46:49.820
I'm going to say that I don't not know for certain that she's not a witch.

46:49.820 --> 46:51.820
I think if you're saying looks alone,

46:51.820 --> 46:55.020
which Hollywood celebs look like witches, it's-

46:56.940 --> 46:57.900
Laura Flynn Boyle.

46:57.900 --> 47:01.260
Laura Flynn Boyle, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Blythe Danner.

47:02.300 --> 47:03.980
And Dakota Fanning.

47:03.980 --> 47:05.420
Dakota Fanning is a witch baby.

47:05.420 --> 47:07.260
Oh, you think she's like aging in reverse?

47:08.220 --> 47:08.700
Right, yeah.

47:08.700 --> 47:11.100
That's what all witches age in reverse.

47:12.140 --> 47:16.540
And of course, Brad Pitt is a warlock because his looks are magical.

47:16.540 --> 47:17.340
Okay.

47:17.340 --> 47:21.500
I'm saying it's not just looks, I'm saying if there's a person on this planet

47:21.500 --> 47:25.020
who bakes children into pastries-

47:26.380 --> 47:27.420
And then doesn't eat them.

47:27.420 --> 47:30.060
And then does not eat them, it is Sarah Jessica Parker.

47:30.940 --> 47:31.980
That's wasteful.

47:31.980 --> 47:34.220
Hey, my wife has been together for seven years.

47:34.220 --> 47:37.020
There are children starving in Africa that you could bake into things.

47:42.780 --> 47:45.900
My wife and I have been together for seven years,

47:45.900 --> 47:49.260
and for seven years I've been an utter disappointment on the dance floor.

47:49.260 --> 47:51.580
Whenever we go out, I usually end up just hanging at the bar

47:51.580 --> 47:52.860
while she dances with her friends.

47:54.060 --> 47:55.340
She says it's not a big deal,

47:55.340 --> 47:57.420
but I would love to be able to enjoy a night out with my wife

47:57.420 --> 47:59.500
without being the awkward guy at the bar.

47:59.500 --> 48:01.580
Should I take measures to learn to dance

48:01.580 --> 48:05.020
or just embrace my role as that guy that can dance?

48:05.020 --> 48:07.420
At least two left feet, maybe more.

48:07.420 --> 48:08.540
That's the name of that question to ask her.

48:08.540 --> 48:10.380
Hey, Broseph, here's the thing.

48:10.380 --> 48:12.860
The only person that thinks you can't dance is you.

48:12.860 --> 48:15.260
Oh, yeah, I think you can dance.

48:15.900 --> 48:18.460
I don't know what skills people think everyone else has

48:18.460 --> 48:20.780
when they say like, I can't dance, I'm not a good dancer.

48:20.780 --> 48:22.780
Have you watched anyone else dance?

48:24.140 --> 48:26.860
Dancing, you used to be able to use that.

48:27.900 --> 48:29.100
I don't think people get this.

48:29.100 --> 48:32.700
When you see someone like in an old movie or something say, I can't dance.

48:32.700 --> 48:35.500
What they mean is like, they don't know how to-

48:35.500 --> 48:37.660
I literally haven't been trained on the steps

48:37.660 --> 48:39.740
of the cha-cha and the bunny hop that everyone else knows.

48:39.740 --> 48:41.580
I don't know the foxtrot, I don't know.

48:41.580 --> 48:44.300
Today, people just look like they're cooking.

48:44.300 --> 48:48.060
If you stand and to the rhythm look like you're like

48:48.060 --> 48:51.500
stirring some mashed potatoes or mashing some potatoes

48:51.500 --> 48:54.700
or eating mashed potatoes, like any one of those-

48:54.700 --> 48:58.460
Yeah, any mashed potato based move is gonna help you out.

48:58.460 --> 48:59.100
Plugging in the beer.

48:59.100 --> 49:00.220
Instant mashed potatoes.

49:00.220 --> 49:02.700
Plugging in the beer to whip up mashed potatoes.

49:03.340 --> 49:05.660
The gravy pour, the gravy pour, the gravy pour.

49:05.660 --> 49:08.060
Spice them up right, spice them up right, spice them up right.

49:08.060 --> 49:11.580
Right, like chunky, chunky, chunky mashed potatoes.

49:11.580 --> 49:12.700
Add the cream, add the cream.

49:12.700 --> 49:14.780
Ah, ah, ah, add the cream, add the cream.

49:14.780 --> 49:17.900
This just became a crimp and I'm so happy about it.

49:17.900 --> 49:19.740
Can I give you the real secret?

49:19.740 --> 49:21.980
Can I give you my secret stuff?

49:21.980 --> 49:23.580
It can be all your dancing secrets.

49:23.580 --> 49:24.700
Here's my secret stuff.

49:24.700 --> 49:25.580
This is a true story.

49:25.580 --> 49:28.940
So last night I went to a party where I did not know many people

49:28.940 --> 49:30.060
and I was sort of nervous.

49:31.340 --> 49:32.300
And then-

49:32.300 --> 49:35.740
By the way, if you don't know any McElroys very well,

49:35.740 --> 49:40.300
I do not know many people is how every story of us getting too drunk starts.

49:40.300 --> 49:42.620
So what happened next was I got too drunk.

49:43.900 --> 49:50.860
And then I started dancing so hard that my wallet fell out of my pants.

49:52.460 --> 49:57.660
So I went from, oh, I don't, I'm so, I'm kind of nervous to be here

49:57.660 --> 50:00.060
because I don't know any glug, glug, glug.

50:00.620 --> 50:02.140
Hey, where's my wallet?

50:02.140 --> 50:03.420
Courage, courage, courage.

50:03.420 --> 50:06.220
I danced so hard.

50:06.220 --> 50:11.020
Listen, take a page out of middle school and high school, Travis,

50:11.020 --> 50:14.700
and learn to dance, go to your wife, who is dancing,

50:15.820 --> 50:19.180
grasp her by the hips, and then just do whatever she does.

50:19.900 --> 50:21.100
Just backwards.

50:21.100 --> 50:22.300
Yeah, just shadow her.

50:22.300 --> 50:26.140
Whatever she does, you lock on and you do that.

50:26.140 --> 50:28.700
Or you could just, the other thing you could do is

50:28.700 --> 50:36.540
is some men take out this route, this, sorry, I got an email that was distracting.

50:36.540 --> 50:41.180
What you could do is you could just, and this works for some men,

50:41.180 --> 50:43.980
I can't pull it off because people expect moves from me,

50:43.980 --> 50:47.180
but some men just get out on the dance floor with their ladies

50:47.180 --> 50:51.900
and they just sort of stand there like a maple for their lady to dance around.

50:52.620 --> 50:55.420
You could do what our dear friend Bobby Glasser does,

50:55.420 --> 50:58.620
which is get out there and just fucking pull moves like Jagger.

50:58.620 --> 51:00.220
Just sway, go to town.

51:00.220 --> 51:01.580
Shimmy, shake.

51:01.580 --> 51:03.580
Just so little is expected from you.

51:03.580 --> 51:04.300
It really is.

51:04.780 --> 51:09.420
Most dancing, especially the dancing that guys do in this sort of scenario,

51:09.420 --> 51:12.140
is basically just listening to the music really hard.

51:12.140 --> 51:14.460
You look like you're really listening to it, like man,

51:14.460 --> 51:16.060
I'm hearing every beat of this.

51:16.700 --> 51:19.740
Maybe you gotta pee a little bit so you're kind of shifting.

51:19.740 --> 51:20.860
Right, yes, exactly.

51:20.860 --> 51:23.740
If you make really intense noises, people are just gonna think

51:23.740 --> 51:26.540
you're dancing really good, like ah, fuck.

51:27.260 --> 51:28.460
You don't even have to move your feet.

51:29.580 --> 51:32.300
And if you get lost, this is pretty easy actually,

51:32.300 --> 51:36.700
if you don't know the next move, you raise your hand up in the air and say,

51:36.700 --> 51:38.380
aw shit, this might jam.

51:40.060 --> 51:41.900
Most people who used to do that, it's a stall.

51:41.900 --> 51:43.340
They're thinking of the next move they're gonna do.

51:43.340 --> 51:46.780
There's a common rookie mistake, don't start singing along to the song.

51:46.780 --> 51:49.260
That is a dead giveaway that you don't know what you're doing.

51:50.620 --> 51:51.980
That is middle school hijinks.

51:51.980 --> 51:56.860
Sing one, like three or four words that really resonate with you.

51:56.860 --> 51:57.500
You know what I mean?

51:57.500 --> 51:58.000
Yes.

51:58.540 --> 52:03.100
So you'll be like, ow, on that September day,

52:03.100 --> 52:05.900
and the whole crowd will just raise their hands with you.

52:06.700 --> 52:06.940
Yeah.

52:06.940 --> 52:07.440
You know?

52:08.140 --> 52:09.740
Like if you listen to Alex Jackson music.

52:09.740 --> 52:11.660
And then when the music ends,

52:11.660 --> 52:13.820
and the next song starts that you're not comfortable with,

52:13.820 --> 52:15.260
dip out to get another drink.

52:15.260 --> 52:15.420
Yeah.

52:15.420 --> 52:17.500
It's like, oh, I gotta take a break.

52:18.940 --> 52:19.500
Too hard.

52:19.500 --> 52:22.140
I'm saying, you're never gonna get better sitting at the bar.

52:22.140 --> 52:22.860
Don't sit at the bar.

52:22.860 --> 52:26.620
You might feel foolish the first couple times you go out there,

52:26.620 --> 52:27.980
but no one's looking at you.

52:27.980 --> 52:30.220
No one gives two shits about what you're doing,

52:30.220 --> 52:32.140
because they're all thinking about how awkward they look.

52:32.140 --> 52:32.640
Right.

52:32.640 --> 52:37.180
I cut my dancing teeth at a bar in Huntington called Club Echo.

52:37.740 --> 52:41.180
On Saturday nights, they would have $5 pitchers of mixed drinks.

52:41.980 --> 52:47.820
And I would get so tipsy topsy turvy on Long Island iced tea,

52:47.820 --> 52:51.500
and then it wasn't up to me anymore.

52:51.500 --> 52:51.980
Like-

52:51.980 --> 52:53.580
No, then you get taken over by the rhythm.

52:53.580 --> 52:53.820
Yeah.

52:53.820 --> 52:54.540
Right.

52:54.540 --> 52:56.060
They'll let the rhythm move you.

52:56.060 --> 52:57.420
And once you do enough of that,

52:57.420 --> 53:00.780
then I think you can start dancing sans booze.

53:02.460 --> 53:03.020
Just not when you're-

53:03.020 --> 53:03.660
Don't ever.

53:03.660 --> 53:05.500
Don't ever dance sans booze.

53:05.500 --> 53:07.100
No, and your wife loves you.

53:07.100 --> 53:09.100
She doesn't care if you look foolish or not.

53:09.100 --> 53:11.260
And she's probably worried about how foolish she looks.

53:11.260 --> 53:12.220
Don't worry about it, dude.

53:12.220 --> 53:13.500
Hey, guy, if you're not out there,

53:13.500 --> 53:15.820
if you're not gonna go out there and you're gonna lose her.

53:15.820 --> 53:16.140
Yeah.

53:16.140 --> 53:17.340
You're not a loser, are you?

53:17.340 --> 53:18.380
Here's, I think that-

53:18.380 --> 53:19.100
That guy?

53:19.100 --> 53:20.060
Slick moves?

53:20.060 --> 53:24.780
Dancing, for men, is almost always an act of contrition.

53:24.780 --> 53:28.700
I feel like, it's like I'm bringing myself to this shame level

53:29.260 --> 53:30.860
for you because I love you so much.

53:31.420 --> 53:32.380
Look at me move.

53:32.380 --> 53:34.540
Look at my big dumb body move.

53:34.540 --> 53:39.820
Look at my stupid, stupid flesh just jiggle for you.

53:40.620 --> 53:41.500
I hate you.

53:41.500 --> 53:41.980
I love you.

53:41.980 --> 53:42.780
But I love you.

53:42.780 --> 53:44.540
And then if you find a weird move that you can do,

53:44.540 --> 53:46.220
just scream like, this is the Todd.

53:46.220 --> 53:47.900
Everybody knew the Todd.

53:47.900 --> 53:50.700
There is always the risk that you are going to start a dance craze.

53:52.460 --> 53:54.140
That fear is present.

53:54.140 --> 53:55.180
Guys, real quick.

53:55.180 --> 53:57.180
Rachel Branson sent in this Yahoo answer.

53:57.180 --> 54:00.140
It's by Yahoo Answers user D, who wants to know,

54:01.420 --> 54:04.940
if you knew you was about to die, what would be your last meal?

54:06.380 --> 54:08.300
I was thinking, if I ever get the death sentence,

54:08.300 --> 54:09.340
what would be my last meal?

54:09.340 --> 54:11.020
I'm wondering what other people would have.

54:11.020 --> 54:15.100
I was thinking a double, an extra large double bacon cheeseburger meal,

54:15.100 --> 54:16.460
supersized from Burger King.

54:16.460 --> 54:17.900
But what to have for dessert?

54:19.100 --> 54:21.340
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

54:21.340 --> 54:22.140
Why are you sad?

54:22.140 --> 54:22.620
You know what?

54:22.620 --> 54:27.180
The irony is that if you have a double bacon supersized chunder meal

54:27.180 --> 54:29.180
from Burger King, that will be your last meal.

54:29.180 --> 54:31.020
You're as good as dead anyway.

54:31.020 --> 54:33.500
A chunder blender from Burger King.

54:35.420 --> 54:38.540
I prefer to go to Outback and get the chunder from Down Under.

54:39.740 --> 54:40.860
What did you get at Burger King?

54:40.860 --> 54:41.420
A mistake.

54:42.940 --> 54:43.980
But that's okay.

54:43.980 --> 54:46.220
You get one last meal and you can pick from anything.

54:46.220 --> 54:47.980
And right after that, you're going to be killed.

54:47.980 --> 54:48.860
What do you want?

54:48.860 --> 54:49.900
Some Burger King.

54:49.900 --> 54:50.300
Yeah.

54:50.300 --> 54:52.220
Can you get me some Burger King?

54:52.220 --> 54:55.740
Can you tip down to BK and get me some twists?

54:56.380 --> 54:59.420
The only thing I can think is that that is a play.

54:59.420 --> 55:02.540
You're making a play so that the governor feels so bad for you

55:02.540 --> 55:05.820
that he decides not to kill you because you're already dead inside.

55:05.820 --> 55:06.060
Right.

55:07.420 --> 55:07.900
Yeah.

55:07.900 --> 55:09.100
What did she ask for?

55:09.100 --> 55:10.060
She asked for Burger-

55:10.060 --> 55:10.380
Okay.

55:10.380 --> 55:13.100
I'm going to give a stay of execution here so I can talk to her.

55:13.100 --> 55:14.300
I want to find out what's up with this girl.

55:14.300 --> 55:17.580
She asked for shitty fish sticks that her mom made in an oven.

55:17.580 --> 55:20.140
Can I get some of those crown-shaped chicken tenders?

55:22.780 --> 55:24.860
And the crown so everybody knows I'm-

55:24.860 --> 55:26.300
So I can sit on my electric throne.

55:28.780 --> 55:30.220
I want to be the king of dead.

55:33.180 --> 55:36.460
I used to be the king of rape murder and now I will be the king of heaven.

55:38.460 --> 55:40.380
Do they still have those Oreo Blast things?

55:40.380 --> 55:43.260
They give you an Oreo Blast and an execution crown.

55:43.260 --> 55:44.380
What's up, Jesus?

55:45.260 --> 55:45.820
Sorry, bro.

55:45.820 --> 55:46.540
Check the crown.

55:47.580 --> 55:48.300
Oh my god.

55:48.300 --> 55:51.260
Wheels and the rest of the BK Kids Club is here.

55:51.260 --> 55:54.460
They're all here welcoming me in.

55:54.460 --> 55:55.580
Welcome me in.

55:55.580 --> 55:57.100
Fly me to heaven, big kid.

56:00.380 --> 56:04.860
You die looking at the picture of the BK Kids Club like Susan Sarandon.

56:04.860 --> 56:08.700
The last face you see is going to be a face of love from wheels and goggles.

56:08.700 --> 56:12.380
But why is wheels in heaven still in a wheelchair?

56:17.580 --> 56:18.060
Wait a minute.

56:18.060 --> 56:20.380
You mean it was an act this whole time?

56:20.380 --> 56:22.460
I wish I'd rape murdered you too, wheels.

56:24.300 --> 56:25.260
My one regret-

56:25.260 --> 56:26.460
Do you have any last words?

56:26.460 --> 56:29.180
Yeah, I wish I'd killed the Burger King Kids Club.

56:29.180 --> 56:30.780
They're a bunch of fucking pros.

56:30.780 --> 56:31.500
What are you-

56:31.500 --> 56:32.620
What are you in for?

56:33.740 --> 56:35.100
Oh god.

56:35.100 --> 56:36.940
I killed the Burger King Kids Club.

56:36.940 --> 56:38.780
I wish I hadn't touched Grimace.

56:38.780 --> 56:40.860
I wish I would have saved it for the Kids Club.

56:41.660 --> 56:42.860
Oh god.

56:42.860 --> 56:44.940
Hey, hey Burger King Kids Club.

56:44.940 --> 56:46.540
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

56:47.180 --> 56:55.100
First, first housekeeping, mbnbam.com is our website.

56:55.900 --> 56:58.540
We are hugely appreciative of-

56:59.180 --> 57:01.020
I thought you were going to say we're hugely popular.

57:01.020 --> 57:03.420
We're hugely popular on the internet.

57:03.420 --> 57:03.820
Thank you to-

57:03.820 --> 57:04.700
We're real big.

57:04.700 --> 57:06.060
We're real big.

57:06.060 --> 57:09.500
Office underscore Memo has been tweeting about the show.

57:09.500 --> 57:12.620
Our buddy Chunky Mouth, Andrew Peters 88,

57:13.260 --> 57:16.860
Xmaster BX, Tobacco, Andy Hunt.

57:16.860 --> 57:17.740
Got some new people.

57:17.740 --> 57:21.180
Did you guys see any new converts?

57:21.180 --> 57:23.900
People who had been putting it off and then finally got on board?

57:23.900 --> 57:24.620
Randy Jackson.

57:25.740 --> 57:29.580
Randy Jackson finally put down the base and picked up an iPod

57:29.580 --> 57:32.460
and listened to our show.

57:32.460 --> 57:33.500
So I appreciate that.

57:33.500 --> 57:36.380
Weird Viking, thank you for tweeting about the show.

57:36.380 --> 57:41.020
Thank you to everybody who hadn't been listening before,

57:41.020 --> 57:44.140
who just started spreading the word.

57:44.780 --> 57:47.420
And for those about to listen, we salute you.

57:49.420 --> 57:53.180
Our old friend Casey Green still spreading the word.

57:53.180 --> 57:54.460
So thank you to everyone.

57:54.460 --> 58:00.220
That's really the only way our show grows is by telling people about the show.

58:00.220 --> 58:09.100
I also want to mention real quick our buddy Bob Ball,

58:09.100 --> 58:11.900
whose dulcet tones you hear starting the show every week.

58:11.900 --> 58:15.500
He's got a new show that's a lot of fun called Pop Quizical.

58:15.500 --> 58:18.060
You can just search for that all one word on iTunes

58:18.060 --> 58:23.660
or he's actually on Twitter under that same handle.

58:23.660 --> 58:29.020
But it's a really short trivia show where he does a specific topic every week

58:29.020 --> 58:34.380
and then you test yourself to see how well you can answer his questions.

58:34.380 --> 58:35.740
It's about Nile Living Dead this week.

58:35.740 --> 58:36.220
It's really good.

58:37.500 --> 58:38.060
I really do.

58:38.060 --> 58:39.820
It's very well produced too, which I like.

58:40.540 --> 58:44.940
It sounds like that, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I need it.

58:44.940 --> 58:45.420
What is it?

58:46.140 --> 58:47.420
Wait, wait, I should know.

58:47.420 --> 58:48.380
Wait, wait, don't do it.

58:48.380 --> 58:50.380
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

58:50.380 --> 58:50.860
Don't do it.

58:51.660 --> 58:52.460
Don't kill wheels.

58:52.460 --> 58:57.260
Don't rape, murder the Bird King Kids Club.

58:59.020 --> 59:00.460
Oh, and mace in your face.

59:00.460 --> 59:04.700
And always Amy H spreading the gospel as it were.

59:04.700 --> 59:08.860
And congratulations to Church's wife who was our thousandth tweet.

59:10.220 --> 59:12.540
Girl Casey said thank you and congratulations.

59:12.540 --> 59:14.700
I want to thank John Roderick real quick.

59:14.700 --> 59:16.060
Can I do that?

59:16.060 --> 59:17.660
Yeah, we got time.

59:17.660 --> 59:21.740
Thank you to John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song.

59:21.740 --> 59:22.780
It's a departure.

59:22.780 --> 59:26.860
You can find that tune and many other amazing tunes on the album,

59:26.860 --> 59:27.820
putting the days to bed.

59:29.500 --> 59:33.020
Yeah, you should go pick up that whole discography.

59:36.620 --> 59:41.580
Oh, if you've got a query, something in your life that you need a little help with,

59:41.580 --> 59:46.060
why don't you email us in bmbm at maximumfund.org.

59:46.060 --> 59:49.500
Email us and just say, hey guys, I've got a short question and I need you to answer it.

59:49.500 --> 59:50.300
Maybe we will.

59:50.300 --> 59:50.780
Who knows?

59:50.780 --> 59:52.620
It's hard to say, you know?

59:52.620 --> 59:54.380
If you attach a dollar bill on there.

59:55.420 --> 59:56.060
Couldn't hurt.

59:56.060 --> 59:59.180
Slide a picture of a dollar bill in and we'll see what we can work out for you.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:04.060
Griffin, I think it's time for the last.

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:09.660
Sorry, I know our new shirt isn't up yet, but it'll be up soon.

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.100
I promise.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:17.100
Or just ask the people on Topo Taco on Tubatico on the internet.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.220
Say, hey guys, where's that new shirt?

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.420
Hey guys, what the fuck?

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.660
What the fuck?

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:26.140
Everyone, we want to see your Halloween costumes this year, so make sure you tweet them out.

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:29.820
Maybe you want to attach MBMBAM to there and we can see them.

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:30.940
Yeah, do that.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.620
Put that in the hashtags so we can see them.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:37.740
If you go in a My Brother and My Brother and Me themed Halloween costume,

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.460
I will say your name on this program.

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:41.820
Boom.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:42.460
There it is.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:43.180
There it is.

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:43.660
Deal with it.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:47.180
And if you can get two friends and you can cosplay as us, all the better.

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:50.220
I will lose my mind if you do that.

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.860
But don't just take a picture of you and two friends and say, oh, it's us.

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:54.620
I want to see distinguishing features.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:55.900
Yeah.

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:56.700
Or anybody.

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.060
Go as Hey Jeffrey if you want.

01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:58.460
I don't care.

01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:58.620
Yeah.

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.500
If you wear a Jeffrey costume, you are not getting any dream.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:06.460
If you go as a horny ghost horse, I will hug you next time I see you.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:07.820
Not if you're wearing that costume, though.

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:09.740
Griffin.

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:12.300
This final question was sent in by Lisa Nikolai.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.100
Thank you, Lisa.

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:20.940
It's by Yahoo Answers User Question Mark, who asks, thanks for pooping in my car, Wendy.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.380
Thank God I had leather seats.

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.100
What should I do?

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.140
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:30.380
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:31.820
This has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:32.860
Kiss your dad.

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:34.220
Swear on the lips.

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:39.580
Keep your heart three stacks.

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.620
Keep your heart.

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.780
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:43.820
Keep your heart.

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.100
Man, these girls are smart.

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:45.740
Three stacks.

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:46.940
These girls are smart.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:02:15.900
Play your part.
