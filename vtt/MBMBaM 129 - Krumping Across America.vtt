00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.640
Hello, welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.640 --> 00:52.400
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Chaboy.

00:52.400 --> 01:00.640
Um, I'm Griffin, I'm Griffin the youngest brother of Travis- okay, Chaboy.

01:00.640 --> 01:01.040
Thank you.

01:02.080 --> 01:06.960
I don't understand, can you walk me through this forest that I all of a sudden find myself?

01:06.960 --> 01:08.320
Here's the thing, Griffin.

01:08.320 --> 01:08.720
Okay.

01:08.720 --> 01:14.560
You know, I'm working on this whole, you know, working on a new me for 30, you know?

01:14.560 --> 01:14.960
Yeah.

01:14.960 --> 01:18.880
And I decided to reinvent myself as a hip-hop personality.

01:19.440 --> 01:19.760
Okay.

01:19.760 --> 01:23.040
You know, I'm not going to say like a hip-hop like music star or anything,

01:23.040 --> 01:25.040
because I have like zero musical talent,

01:25.040 --> 01:29.280
but I just want to be like that dude who danced with the Umbrella in the Andre 3000 videos.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.240
And kids love- kids love that motherfucker.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.920
They love that Farnsworth bastard.

01:37.920 --> 01:38.640
Yeah.

01:39.360 --> 01:46.400
Now, can you walk me through kind of a- I find myself in kind of a spelling quandary.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.680
Can you walk me through-

01:47.680 --> 01:53.200
Yeah. Thank you, Justin. It's C-H apostrophe A apostrophe B-O-I.

01:54.080 --> 01:54.400
Okay.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.080
Chaboy from the context, it's ya boy.

01:58.080 --> 02:01.840
Now, at first blush, you might think it's cha-ah boy,

02:01.840 --> 02:06.480
but it's really just one fluid motion, like throwing a baseball.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.040
Chaboy.

02:07.760 --> 02:08.000
Okay.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.440
There might be an umlaut in there too.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.240
I haven't decided yet.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.760
I've got a marketing team working on it.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.560
Umlauts are really big right now.

02:14.560 --> 02:18.240
Kids fucking love umlauts and they love people dancing with umbrellas.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.240
Fucking love people dancing with umlauts.

02:21.040 --> 02:21.840
That'd be a great-

02:21.840 --> 02:23.440
That'd be a great Paula Abdul video.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.280
Just her dancing with an umlaut.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.040
Yeah. Or a cartoon cat.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.280
Hey, happy Franksgiving, y'all.

02:29.280 --> 02:29.520
I-

02:30.080 --> 02:32.560
Hey, happy Thanksgiving to you, Chaboy.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.600
Griffin, it sounded like you said Franksgiving.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.440
It did sound like you said Franksgiving.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.280
Listen, I've been working with my own marketing team-

02:39.280 --> 02:40.080
Was that intentional?

02:41.280 --> 02:43.760
I've been working with my own marketing team about how to sex-

02:43.760 --> 02:45.600
Are you gonna eat a bunch of hot dogs tomorrow?

02:46.240 --> 02:48.240
How to sex up Thanksgiving.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.640
And I think I've come up with the perfect solution.

02:50.640 --> 02:51.040
Tell me.

02:51.680 --> 02:55.360
We reinvented it as a hip hop personality called Franksgiving.

02:55.360 --> 02:59.680
Okay, let me throw this out because this is my topical humor joke that I alluded to before

02:59.680 --> 03:01.440
we began the recording.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.120
Oh good, I've been on Bins and Needles.

03:03.120 --> 03:03.600
Ahem.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.880
With Colorado legalizing marijuana.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.320
More like Danksgiving.

03:08.320 --> 03:08.640
Okay.

03:09.200 --> 03:09.600
All right.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.400
I like it.

03:10.400 --> 03:10.960
Thank you.

03:10.960 --> 03:11.200
So-

03:11.200 --> 03:11.920
I like it.

03:11.920 --> 03:12.960
I like it.

03:12.960 --> 03:16.080
With what's going on at TNM and Square, more like Tankgiving.

03:16.080 --> 03:16.960
Is that still-

03:16.960 --> 03:17.680
That is not.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.280
I don't think that's still an issue.

03:20.560 --> 03:26.880
Now here is my hip hop joke personality that I have.

03:27.920 --> 03:29.680
None of these are jokes so far, but go on.

03:29.680 --> 03:30.000
Okay.

03:30.800 --> 03:31.120
It's-

03:36.400 --> 03:38.080
You didn't have a follow through for that, did you?

03:38.080 --> 03:38.240
It's-

03:39.600 --> 03:40.400
It's Shitty Tim.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.720
Oh man.

03:42.720 --> 03:43.200
Pardon?

03:44.240 --> 03:51.200
It's a character that I made up called-

03:51.200 --> 03:51.360
Okay.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.080
His name is Shitty Tim.

03:54.640 --> 03:57.120
Does he have any distinguishing characteristics at all?

03:57.760 --> 04:00.880
He's named Shitty Tim and he has-

04:01.440 --> 04:02.560
Is it ironic at all?

04:02.560 --> 04:04.880
Like is he in fact really awesome and named Steve?

04:04.880 --> 04:06.080
He has a really-

04:06.080 --> 04:08.720
Yeah, I'm not good with this like you guys.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.320
He has a really big butt.

04:10.320 --> 04:13.280
Is that funny?

04:13.280 --> 04:14.720
But not where you'd picture it.

04:14.720 --> 04:15.680
I'm 32.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.880
Is there an outside chance that he stinks?

04:18.880 --> 04:19.380
Yeah.

04:22.000 --> 04:22.500
What?

04:23.360 --> 04:24.160
Why would he-

04:25.200 --> 04:25.760
Like shit.

04:25.760 --> 04:26.260
Why would-

04:27.760 --> 04:28.560
I didn't mean-

04:30.080 --> 04:33.280
Let's just answer a question.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.560
I'll do it in the Shitty Tim.

04:34.560 --> 04:35.060
Okay.

04:35.060 --> 04:38.840
I'll do it in the Shitty Tim voice that I've been making up lately.

04:40.440 --> 04:45.400
About a month ago, I responded to a woman's Craigslist ad looking for a virgin man,

04:46.120 --> 04:49.000
i.e. 18 and older, to have sex with.

04:49.640 --> 04:50.520
That's done.

04:51.560 --> 04:52.040
Done.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.320
Check please.

04:53.320 --> 04:53.720
Bye.

04:54.360 --> 04:59.560
I'm not a virgin, but it's been about three and a half years since the last time I had sex,

04:59.560 --> 05:01.160
so I responded to the ad anyway.

05:01.160 --> 05:05.880
Anyway, she came over to my house a couple days after that, and we hooked up.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.520
Now, here's my problem.

05:09.400 --> 05:13.560
We've been out about three times after this, and I'm starting to develop real feelings for her.

05:14.200 --> 05:19.720
I know that it won't work if it's built on a lie, but she has a wonderful personality

05:19.720 --> 05:22.600
and could see myself in a long-term relationship with her.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.920
What do I do?

05:26.040 --> 05:27.560
Oh man.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.040
Okay.

05:28.040 --> 05:28.840
There's a lot.

05:29.960 --> 05:30.600
Some layers.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.400
There's a lot of moving parts in this Rue Goldberg machine.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.320
I'd like to start with the top layer, which is yes.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.200
Yes, you should tell her.

05:40.200 --> 05:45.160
If you want to build a relationship with this woman, you should tell her because you're right.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.160
Your instincts are right.

05:47.160 --> 05:47.400
Yes.

05:48.440 --> 05:52.280
And you may, I mean, it may be irreparable.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.120
That's a pretty big thing.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.720
That's kind of the biggest.

05:55.720 --> 06:03.640
But it's better for it to be, if it's irreparable, it's better to get it out now than like nine

06:03.640 --> 06:11.560
months from now, I don't know, some friend telling a story about this wild night in college

06:11.560 --> 06:15.320
or something, and then she finds out, and it's like, well, we've been living a lie for nine

06:15.320 --> 06:16.680
months as opposed to three days.

06:16.680 --> 06:17.080
Right.

06:17.080 --> 06:22.440
You don't want to end up like this one guy I know and have to pretend to really like

06:22.440 --> 06:30.760
Barbara Streisand movies for three years because that was the way you got the relationship going.

06:31.720 --> 06:37.080
What you also don't want to happen is to get your whole head cut off and buried in her

06:37.080 --> 06:38.120
fucking yard.

06:38.120 --> 06:41.000
Why are you dating a praying mantis?

06:41.000 --> 06:41.480
What?

06:41.480 --> 06:45.480
This is a good question because now let's go to a deeper layer.

06:45.480 --> 06:50.040
Okay, which is every sentence in this email is the craziest thing I've ever.

06:50.040 --> 06:53.400
She wants a virgin man, i.e. 18 years or older.

06:53.400 --> 06:57.240
Yeah, I should fucking definitely hope so.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.680
So she's like Foley Gozer, right?

07:00.680 --> 07:04.440
I mean, she's Gozer, basically, just so we're clear.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.320
She's looking for the key master to her gatekeeper.

07:07.320 --> 07:07.560
Right.

07:07.560 --> 07:13.160
Let's also talk about the fact that she wanted to fuck a sweet, sweet, innocent porcelain

07:13.160 --> 07:17.880
doll of a fresh faced boy, and you were not a virgin.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.480
You had dipped it before.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.160
But that's what she was saying.

07:21.160 --> 07:26.760
Like, if you met up and immediately had sex, she just wanted to deflower a dude, right?

07:28.200 --> 07:31.880
These are all good and important and awful questions.

07:31.880 --> 07:37.160
But then to say, okay, listen, question asker, I'm not trying to judge.

07:37.160 --> 07:42.440
But to say that her whole deal was to look for a dude to deflower off the internet,

07:42.440 --> 07:44.600
and now you're developing real feelings for her.

07:44.600 --> 07:49.400
It's like, man, maybe you need to really examine the second half of the sentence I just said.

07:49.400 --> 07:54.040
Because I don't think that she, I mean, that doesn't sound like what she wants.

07:54.040 --> 07:57.880
Yeah, it doesn't sound like she's really looking to settle down.

07:57.880 --> 08:01.560
If so, she'd be on match.com instead of skeevy craigslist.

08:01.560 --> 08:05.960
Yeah, I think she's just going back to make sure you're like super deflowered.

08:05.960 --> 08:09.160
Like, she's trying to make sure she got every last petal off of you.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.920
Like, what about your anal virginity?

08:10.920 --> 08:11.880
I'll take that next.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.240
I want to get all of it.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.760
Ass to mouth.

08:14.760 --> 08:15.720
Here we go.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.160
What's up with your knee pits?

08:17.160 --> 08:18.280
Haven't seen those yet.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.560
Gonna fuck those.

08:19.560 --> 08:20.280
Lube them up.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.960
Put that weird monkey toe in me.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.120
Come on, come on, shitty Tim.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.400
Put that little toe in me.

08:32.040 --> 08:34.360
I want to fuck all your toes one by one.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.600
Stock up on calcium.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.800
This is cramp-inducing.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.200
All of this is thoroughly erotic.

08:42.200 --> 08:48.200
But you need to keep your heart three stacks because this, I don't know about this.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.440
I don't know that she's looking for this.

08:50.440 --> 08:54.040
I bet if he didn't listen to the whole craigslist, he's 18 and older.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.800
I bet it's a little more like 18 to 19 is how the ad read.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.280
I don't want anybody, I don't want a bunch of old meat.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.880
She wants a fresh plate.

09:04.520 --> 09:07.720
If you can actually come to me the night before your 18th birthday,

09:07.720 --> 09:09.800
and then we can bring it in in style this second.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.640
Please don't tell any loved ones where you've gone or somewhere where they can track you.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.440
That would be great.

09:14.440 --> 09:19.000
Yeah, this is going to be, basically what we want is a 128 hours setup.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.400
I need to resurrect my fallen lord.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.080
How much blood do you have in you?

09:25.240 --> 09:32.280
Let's be like totally honest that if you responded to a craigslist from someone looking to

09:33.000 --> 09:37.880
consume an 18 year old virgin, maybe instead of developing feelings,

09:37.880 --> 09:43.000
you should be busy counting your lucky stars that you have a head attached to your body.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.160
And then all your blood is not staining a motel six right now.

09:47.160 --> 09:51.160
From the 80s where he goes and they go to collect his blood and they're like,

09:51.160 --> 09:52.520
but it's not working.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.720
Are you really a virgin?

09:53.720 --> 09:55.720
He's like, well, it's been three and a half years.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.600
Musical sting.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.360
I can't believe this fucking panned out for this dude.

10:02.360 --> 10:02.680
I know.

10:02.680 --> 10:05.880
I can't believe that you went on craigslist and craigslist was like,

10:05.880 --> 10:08.040
hey, I want to fuck you, shitty Tim.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.480
And then he was like, okay.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.040
And then he fucked craigslist and now he's alive.

10:12.040 --> 10:16.840
Like none of the, maybe three of those things could happen, but not all.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.560
It's got to balance out until like three years from now,

10:19.560 --> 10:21.560
like an asteroid falls on him or something.

10:21.560 --> 10:24.120
Just as like, it's like final destination.

10:24.120 --> 10:28.600
You know, death missed him and now they'll be hunting him for the rest of his life.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.280
I sold my bed on craigslist.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.200
I was selling it for $200.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.960
Just when we showed up, she was like, oh, nice, nice.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.080
How about a hundred dollars?

10:35.080 --> 10:38.520
So I kind of got fucked by craigslist in a way.

10:38.520 --> 10:39.400
Did that really happen?

10:40.040 --> 10:40.360
Yeah.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.480
Did she give you a hundo?

10:42.040 --> 10:43.720
She gave me a hard sell for a hundo.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.480
She was just coming out of a divorce.

10:45.480 --> 10:46.840
Things were not doing great.

10:46.840 --> 10:50.440
And she was sitting on my bed and I was extraordinarily uncomfortable.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.160
She's sitting on your bed.

10:51.160 --> 10:54.200
She's like, hey, this, this got a good spring to it.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.000
What's your virginity sitch right now?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.840
Where are you at as far as your flower?

10:58.840 --> 11:00.040
Where's the flower at?

11:02.600 --> 11:03.960
Griffin, do you have a yahoos for us?

11:03.960 --> 11:04.760
I got a few.

11:04.760 --> 11:05.080
Yeah.

11:06.680 --> 11:07.560
How about this one?

11:08.120 --> 11:15.960
It was, uh, it was sent in by Robert Chachere or Chachere or Chachere or Chachere.

11:17.400 --> 11:23.720
It's, it's fun to look at and to say it's asked by Yahoo Answers user, I Corpse Grinder.

11:23.720 --> 11:24.600
Oh God.

11:25.640 --> 11:30.280
Who asks, what happens if you give a horse marijuana?

11:31.640 --> 11:34.280
Some friends of my brothers gave a horse an ounce of marijuana.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.600
And now the horse is just laying on the floor.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.440
Could the marijuana kill the horse?

11:38.440 --> 11:39.560
I'm seriously concerned.

11:39.560 --> 11:42.360
He hasn't gotten up in a while, but I know he's alive.

11:42.360 --> 11:46.200
Well, one, what happens is you've wasted a bunch of sticky weed.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.240
Oh no.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.520
But I'm assuming this question takes place in Colorado.

11:50.520 --> 11:51.240
Oh, okay.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.880
Where it's just like falling out of people's pockets.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.880
It's just falling out of people's pockets and butts.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.600
Is it an accidental thing?

11:58.600 --> 12:02.200
Because I knew a dog in college that ate a bag of weed.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.680
It's just a chill dog.

12:04.680 --> 12:09.000
Or is this like, they like roll the carrot and some honey and then dipped it in the weed

12:09.000 --> 12:10.040
and toss it to the horse.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.200
This death, death sounds like funsies.

12:12.200 --> 12:12.920
Okay.

12:12.920 --> 12:18.760
This sounds like, honestly, like when you think of any time that a horse riding disaster

12:18.760 --> 12:23.240
takes place, it's usually because the horse gets so fucking crazy wild.

12:23.240 --> 12:28.120
When that horse bucked Christopher Reeves over that fence and basically, you know,

12:28.120 --> 12:32.760
paralyzed him forever, it was probably because he was like going fucking buck wild

12:32.760 --> 12:34.440
because he had a man riding on him.

12:34.440 --> 12:34.760
Right.

12:34.760 --> 12:35.640
Not just any man.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.280
If he had just rolled him a sweet joint.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.400
I think if we can, I think if we can mellow these horses out,

12:41.400 --> 12:43.080
then we could really get something going.

12:44.680 --> 12:48.120
I, I don't, okay.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.400
How was the marijuana administered to the horse?

12:51.400 --> 12:52.040
Peer pressure.

12:52.040 --> 12:58.120
Come on, black beauty.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.320
Just dip in.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.760
Come on, Mr. Ed.

13:00.760 --> 13:01.800
Don't be a pussy.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.240
Don't be a pussy, black beauty.

13:05.080 --> 13:06.600
With your powerful haunches.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.800
Bring those powerful haunches over here and use them to smoke this herb.

13:12.840 --> 13:17.000
I can't imagine fucking, they give, they have, they had to design.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.040
They had to create something called horse tranquilizer.

13:20.040 --> 13:23.240
Like it's specially designed because a horse was so powerful

13:23.240 --> 13:25.480
that a normal tranquilizer couldn't take it out.

13:25.480 --> 13:28.200
And you think that like an ounce of weed and the horse is just like,

13:28.200 --> 13:29.720
I'm never getting up again.

13:29.720 --> 13:30.280
I'm done.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.680
Maybe I read this question wrong.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.520
Maybe it's asking about horse marijuana.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.240
Oh.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.440
What happens if you give a horse marijuana?

13:40.440 --> 13:42.040
Oh, now it's okay.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.040
See, that makes a lot more sense.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.280
What does it, why are we using our,

13:48.280 --> 13:50.840
who are these teens?

13:50.840 --> 13:51.320
Right?

13:51.320 --> 13:54.520
Who are these teens that, do you know where I buy drugs?

13:55.320 --> 13:56.040
Rite Aid.

13:56.040 --> 13:59.480
I have no idea where to get drugs.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.200
I don't know how to get, people, I say this on the show.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.680
You actually just go behind the Rite Aid and there's a guy there.

14:04.680 --> 14:05.800
There probably is a guy.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.000
There's a place called Wrong Aid.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.840
I don't know where to get, like,

14:13.160 --> 14:15.640
I don't know where to find drugs.

14:15.640 --> 14:19.160
And these kids have such a solid supply of them

14:19.160 --> 14:20.760
that they're giving them to horses.

14:21.720 --> 14:21.960
Yeah.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.720
It makes me so angry.

14:24.440 --> 14:27.720
I mean, how do you think they do in like Denver?

14:28.920 --> 14:32.040
This is what this, like in Denver, no joke.

14:32.040 --> 14:37.640
I bet everybody has just pockets fattened with that dank fish.

14:37.640 --> 14:42.920
I give it six months before horse weeding is like a professional sport in Denver.

14:42.920 --> 14:47.320
Mm-hmm, it's how high can you get a living horse?

14:47.320 --> 14:50.360
Now that caveat is so vital.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.640
Because anybody can just like feed a horse a bunch of weed.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.880
I want you guys to know I almost said horse stoning,

14:55.880 --> 14:59.320
but then I thought that that might sound like throwing rocks at horses.

14:59.320 --> 15:00.920
If this show is devoted to anything,

15:00.920 --> 15:04.840
it's the protection and preservation and not killing of horses.

15:04.840 --> 15:08.840
It's been like Jonathan Swift level of like irony up to this point.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.880
You know, we talk about killing horses because we don't want to kill horses.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.440
Yeah, but the New York Times told me that the irony is bad

15:14.440 --> 15:16.440
and that we should live without it from now on.

15:16.440 --> 15:21.400
So I'm going to say that I think horses are just beautiful and majestic.

15:22.040 --> 15:22.280
Yeah, me too.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.400
Did I use the right word there?

15:23.400 --> 15:25.080
Did Jonathan Swift write with irony?

15:25.640 --> 15:28.520
No, it's a little satire, but you're almost there.

15:28.520 --> 15:33.000
You know, if I see someone using glue,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.880
I look at them like they're Kony 2012.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.800
Like I have no patience for it.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.400
Can we stop melting them?

15:39.400 --> 15:41.240
I look at them like they're Kony 2013,

15:41.240 --> 15:41.640
which is a sequel.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.600
What if you made a horse sniff glue to get high?

15:44.600 --> 15:45.320
Wait a minute.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.160
Oh my God.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.840
That's terrible, Travis.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.120
Sniff your brother.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.440
That's not going to be a mellow high.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.120
That is going to be a rough.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.840
That's going to be a rough journey that you're going to go on.

15:56.840 --> 16:00.120
Hey, I just broke up with my boyfriend at 12 years today.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.720
Naturally, I'm pretty devastated.

16:01.720 --> 16:02.280
This isn't me.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.160
It's a question.

16:03.160 --> 16:03.560
Oh, okay.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.040
Naturally, I'm pretty devastated.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.960
It has been over 12 years since I've been dumped.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.880
I have no idea what to do right now,

16:09.880 --> 16:12.120
aside from some really heavy drinking.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.560
All our close friends are mutual,

16:13.560 --> 16:16.920
so I don't have anyone I can feel I can entirely discuss the subject with

16:16.920 --> 16:18.920
without it turning to idle gossip.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.400
Brothers, can you put this in perspective?

16:21.960 --> 16:25.000
Find me a silver lining because I just cannot find one.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.400
And help me figure out how to feel not so toxic towards my ex-boyfriend.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.080
If the subject matter is too depressing,

16:31.080 --> 16:34.680
I have no problems with you turning this into a hilarious goof

16:34.680 --> 16:36.840
that's from Gutted in Toronto.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.880
Oh, listen, because I've been doing a lot of soul searching

16:39.880 --> 16:41.160
over the last two or three weeks.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.000
And here's the main point.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.320
The biggest point to take away is that what's the silver lining?

16:47.320 --> 16:49.640
It's that you're still alive with a bright future

16:49.640 --> 16:51.080
and a whole new world in front of you.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.080
Like, I mean, it seems bad in 12 years.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.600
Yeah, like it's a massive scale,

16:56.600 --> 16:59.720
but you still have so much time left in this world.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.800
Like you still have your whole life to live.

17:01.800 --> 17:05.320
Got it in Toronto any day above the grass, baby.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.000
Any day above the grass.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.200
Quarter mile at a time.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.640
Quarter mile at a time.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.320
Got to play to the whistle blows.

17:11.320 --> 17:13.320
Here, let me give you a silver lining.

17:13.320 --> 17:19.480
Right now, I, in my life, stress about work.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.080
I stress about the show I'm directing.

17:21.080 --> 17:24.200
I stress about how I, more morally,

17:24.200 --> 17:26.360
I stress about how I'm eating too much,

17:26.360 --> 17:29.400
how I need to exercise more, how I need to get healthier,

17:29.400 --> 17:32.280
how I need to have better relationships with people.

17:32.280 --> 17:36.840
You have that so, that rare, rare gift

17:36.840 --> 17:38.200
that only comes around

17:38.200 --> 17:40.840
when something really terrible happens to you

17:40.840 --> 17:46.040
that you don't have to give a solitary fuck about anything.

17:46.040 --> 17:46.600
Oh yeah.

17:46.600 --> 17:50.200
You can just treat, have you ever always wanted

17:50.200 --> 17:52.120
to have a Pop-Tart with butter on it?

17:52.120 --> 17:53.240
Fucking have it.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.920
You're healing right now.

17:54.920 --> 17:58.520
Take, get a big, get a big bite of that recovery sandwich

17:58.520 --> 18:02.280
and by recovery sandwich, I literally mean a giant sandwich,

18:02.280 --> 18:03.160
like a meatball sub.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.000
The biggest sandwich, whatever the fuck you want.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.640
Can you make a sandwich out of Pop-Tarts and butter?

18:07.640 --> 18:07.880
Oh my God, yeah.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.480
If you want like an ice cream sandwich

18:09.480 --> 18:12.360
that's just like bread and ice cream, go to town.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.440
Well, don't do, that sounds fucking awful.

18:14.440 --> 18:15.960
What about a peanut butter Pop-Tart sandwich?

18:15.960 --> 18:16.360
Go on.

18:16.360 --> 18:17.640
Peanut butter between the two Pop-Tarts.

18:17.640 --> 18:20.040
Why don't you just go to fucking Papa John's

18:20.040 --> 18:21.800
and eat a pizza like a normal person?

18:21.800 --> 18:22.040
Okay.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.280
You guys are talking about weird sandwiches first.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.880
Listen, and don't, and I know that you're worried

18:27.880 --> 18:30.200
about harboring a lot of resentment and bitterness

18:30.200 --> 18:33.640
towards your ex-boyfriend, but let me tell you something.

18:34.920 --> 18:38.600
That's, that's how adults work.

18:38.600 --> 18:39.720
That's completely right.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.560
Listen, when, when a big event happens,

18:41.560 --> 18:42.840
you're going to go one of two ways,

18:42.840 --> 18:44.920
really happy or really upset.

18:44.920 --> 18:48.920
Like children have hope about the future to fuel them.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.320
Adults have bitterness.

18:51.320 --> 18:54.360
Let your hatred toward him be an engine

18:54.360 --> 18:57.080
that helps you to keep moving forward.

18:57.080 --> 19:01.960
You have a renewable resource of, of energy and vigor.

19:01.960 --> 19:04.280
All you have to do is think about how much you hate his guts

19:04.280 --> 19:06.520
and look, oh, you're revitalized.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.560
Thank you, adulthood.

19:07.560 --> 19:08.840
This is way better than kid.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.160
You have nothing to worry about.

19:11.160 --> 19:12.440
Stop beating yourself up.

19:12.440 --> 19:15.400
Stop, stop stressing about needing to feel better

19:15.400 --> 19:18.520
and stop stressing about harboring ill will towards this guy

19:19.160 --> 19:22.200
and focus on the, the important thing right now,

19:22.200 --> 19:24.440
which is taking care of yourself,

19:24.440 --> 19:26.760
making yourself happy in the short term.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.200
You do it enough in the short term

19:28.200 --> 19:31.400
and I promise you the long-term stuff will figure itself out.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.680
Griffin, hit me with a Yahoo.

19:32.680 --> 19:33.240
Put it in me.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.560
Oh, could we stop and just stop?

19:37.560 --> 19:38.920
Put a Yahoo in there.

19:40.920 --> 19:41.880
How about this Yahoo?

19:42.440 --> 19:45.720
It was, it was sent in by Ira Ray.

19:45.720 --> 19:46.440
Thank you, Ira.

19:46.440 --> 19:53.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jezebel Terrace who asks,

19:53.000 --> 19:57.320
is it right for a 13-year-old to know how to krump?

20:00.440 --> 20:03.720
If I'm 13, is it okay if I know how to krump?

20:03.720 --> 20:06.280
My mom told me that it's not very Christian-like

20:06.280 --> 20:09.480
or appropriate to do this, but I love to dance.

20:09.480 --> 20:12.920
I also love, love, love dancing to hip-hop

20:12.920 --> 20:14.840
because it lets me get my feelings out.

20:15.880 --> 20:20.280
But my mom says I should stick to sports.

20:20.280 --> 20:23.000
Any advice or comments?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.800
I need to look up krump dancing to see if that's a thing.

20:27.000 --> 20:27.720
Travis.

20:30.360 --> 20:33.240
It's like you've never seen a Missy Elliott music video

20:33.240 --> 20:35.560
or that one episode of America's Next Top Model

20:35.560 --> 20:36.840
where they had the ladies krump

20:36.840 --> 20:40.200
and they took pictures of them fucking mid-krump

20:40.200 --> 20:43.320
as their faces were all rubberized in beast mode.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.760
Oh man.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.800
Oh my God, I laughed at that person for saying

20:47.800 --> 20:50.360
that hip-hop dancing is how they get their feelings out.

20:50.360 --> 20:54.600
And the very top line on the krumping entry of Wikipedia

20:54.600 --> 20:57.880
is the youth who started krumping saw the dances away

20:57.880 --> 21:00.040
for them to escape gang life and to quote,

21:00.040 --> 21:03.320
release anger, aggression, and frustration positively

21:03.320 --> 21:04.520
in a non-violent way.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.440
I will say this, every time I've seen someone krump,

21:06.440 --> 21:07.640
it looks really violent.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.640
It looks like someone has bees on them

21:11.640 --> 21:13.880
and they're trying to kill beetles underneath them.

21:13.880 --> 21:17.080
So they're choosing the bees to kill the beetles

21:17.080 --> 21:17.880
on their body.

21:17.880 --> 21:21.800
Right, they're just trying to kill the beetles

21:21.800 --> 21:23.240
but they're distracted by the bees.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.400
That's what krumping looks like to me.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.920
But I am 32.

21:26.920 --> 21:27.800
Holy shit.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.120
Are you watching some video somewhere?

21:30.120 --> 21:31.800
Are you watching like a sick krumping video

21:31.800 --> 21:33.080
while we're trying to make a podcast?

21:33.080 --> 21:34.200
I'm looking at the history.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.520
The root word krump came from the lyrics of a song

21:36.520 --> 21:37.080
in the 90s.

21:37.080 --> 21:43.880
It is sometimes spelled K-R-U-M-P with periods between it.

21:43.880 --> 21:44.520
Which is a-

21:44.520 --> 21:46.360
Oh, so is it an acronym?

21:46.360 --> 21:50.040
It says it's a backronym for Kingdom Radically

21:50.040 --> 21:51.720
Uplifted Mighty Praise,

21:51.720 --> 21:54.520
presenting krumping as a faith-based art form.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.600
It is, obviously, much like My Brother, My Brother, Me,

21:58.600 --> 22:00.280
it is a faith-based art form.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.440
Krumping was created by two dancers,

22:02.440 --> 22:07.160
Cesar Titeyes Willis and Joe Artis Big Mejo Ratty.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.440
Now Joe Artis has the best name

22:10.440 --> 22:15.080
because it's J-O apostrophe capital A-R-T-I-S.

22:15.080 --> 22:18.680
Now Travis, is that Titeyes or Titeyes?

22:18.680 --> 22:19.560
Great question.

22:19.560 --> 22:23.400
It's Tite space eyes with a Z.

22:24.440 --> 22:24.760
Okay.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.880
I don't know how one gets the nickname Titeyes.

22:27.880 --> 22:33.720
Ken, so is this Wikipedia entry telling us that we can use krumping

22:33.720 --> 22:35.880
as a method of praising our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?

22:35.880 --> 22:38.760
I think they're telling you that it's a way to motivate kids

22:38.760 --> 22:40.040
in the school gymnasium.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.480
I think that whatever you're doing,

22:44.040 --> 22:45.720
maybe it's about praising Jesus.

22:46.280 --> 22:50.440
Maybe it's about just being really angry at your dad.

22:50.440 --> 22:56.120
The key thing is to have emotion that you bring to it.

22:56.120 --> 23:01.000
I think it was, I believe it was Robert Foolish with Ph Jones who said,

23:01.560 --> 23:05.960
expression is a must in krump because krump is expression.

23:05.960 --> 23:09.080
I don't think I could vent my feelings via krumping in a healthy way.

23:09.080 --> 23:12.040
I think if I ever got into a krump off with somebody,

23:12.040 --> 23:14.680
it would like, it would start out as a very healthy,

23:14.680 --> 23:17.400
you know, just pounding it, pounding it and grinding.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.480
And then like, it would very quickly turn into me like,

23:19.480 --> 23:21.560
good fucking get it, come get it.

23:21.560 --> 23:24.040
And then people would be like, hey, stop, cut that out.

23:24.040 --> 23:28.200
Might I suggest clowning, which is the less aggressive predecessor to krumping

23:28.200 --> 23:32.520
and was created in 1992 by Thomas, Tommy the Clown Johnson in Compton.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.640
That is actually the, it's funny you bring that up.

23:35.640 --> 23:38.760
That is the subject of the episode of America's Next Top Model,

23:38.760 --> 23:42.920
of which I learned everything and that there is to know about krumping and clowning.

23:45.720 --> 23:48.280
You know what sucks about krumping though, if you're really good at it,

23:48.280 --> 23:53.160
like it has less practical applications than like the Foxtrot.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.480
Like you can't bust that shit out at a wedding, you know?

23:56.440 --> 23:58.360
You can use it to dodge bullets.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.520
I'd rather watch that.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.440
You can use it to matrix.

24:02.440 --> 24:05.800
I would rather watch someone swing dance than krump at a wedding.

24:06.440 --> 24:10.360
I have a theory that sometimes when you do a krump,

24:10.360 --> 24:15.400
it's the krump that you'll need to use to save yourself from a hail of bullets.

24:15.400 --> 24:19.640
And every krump move that you krump is specifically designed

24:19.640 --> 24:23.720
to help you avoid those bullets when you eventually are shot at.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.080
So it's like signs.

24:25.080 --> 24:28.280
Well, it's basically, I was thinking Slumdog Millionaire,

24:28.280 --> 24:29.720
but yeah, signs would work too.

24:30.840 --> 24:35.800
I bet like if someone from the past were to like be launch forward in time

24:35.800 --> 24:37.160
and see someone krumping, they'd be like,

24:37.160 --> 24:39.560
that's the mythical dance to defeat the dragon.

24:39.560 --> 24:43.000
Like it always seems like it has some kind of mystical significance to it.

24:43.000 --> 24:49.560
Yeah, I've always seen somebody krumping and said that seems significant.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.600
This means something.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.720
Is krumping inherently solo or can you krump with a partner?

24:57.160 --> 24:59.400
There's so much flailing involved.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.560
I think if you get more than one hot body in there,

25:01.560 --> 25:03.560
then it's gonna, things are gonna get dirty.

25:03.560 --> 25:04.600
Things are gonna get rough.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.040
I think you gotta have six feet between krumpers.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.680
That's why krumping across America never got off the ground

25:10.680 --> 25:12.200
because they would keep punching each other.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.480
Gotta leave room for the holy krump.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.320
Because Jesus is in there krumping too, you guys.

25:19.320 --> 25:25.160
Do you think when mankind krumps, God looks down on us and says, yes.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.040
This is the pinnacles of civilization.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.320
They found it.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.080
My creation, thank you.

25:31.080 --> 25:32.520
It's all led to this.

25:33.400 --> 25:37.960
God is watching us krump from a distance.

25:37.960 --> 25:41.960
Oh, man.

25:41.960 --> 25:44.200
Everybody stop doing wars.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.880
These guys over here figured it out.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.360
Everyone listen, I'm God.

25:48.360 --> 25:53.800
In case you were wondering why krump is apparently the best dance I've ever heard of,

25:53.800 --> 25:57.080
it is this, the first line of the Wikipedia entry for style.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.200
There are four primary moves in krump.

26:00.200 --> 26:03.080
Jabs, arm swings, chest pops, and stomps.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.320
That sounds like the best dance.

26:05.320 --> 26:08.200
That sounds like something I could get on board with.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.600
You remember the boneless boy dance?

26:12.440 --> 26:14.200
That's more or less krump at this point.

26:17.320 --> 26:21.000
So we hope that you've enjoyed learning about krump

26:21.000 --> 26:26.520
as much as we've enjoyed learning about krump as we record our show.

26:27.240 --> 26:29.640
But believe it or not, we get paid to do this.

26:29.640 --> 26:34.840
This is Money Zone.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.520
Griffin, who's this message to?

26:45.320 --> 26:46.520
This particular message?

26:47.240 --> 26:48.280
This shit right here?

26:48.840 --> 26:52.840
Yeah, it's popping off right now and we've got to deliver it hot.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.920
You mean this message that you're talking about now?

26:54.920 --> 27:00.040
Yes, this current message, the one that you're fervently looking up in your email.

27:00.760 --> 27:03.240
Man, did you guys see that latest episode of Saturday Night Live?

27:03.240 --> 27:06.920
This episode was sent in by Annie.

27:07.560 --> 27:12.280
Thank you, Annie, for sending in this special birthday message for Catherine.

27:12.280 --> 27:13.480
Happy birthday, Catherine.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.400
Annie says happy birthday.

27:15.400 --> 27:19.000
And then she says that the Dilbert Scott Adams goof

27:19.000 --> 27:23.400
is Catherine's favorite goof that we or assumedly anybody has ever done.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.440
And so if Justin could work it in somehow, that would be great.

27:26.440 --> 27:27.160
Justin?

27:27.160 --> 27:28.840
Could you lay down some Dilbert goofs?

27:29.640 --> 27:32.840
Can you guys remind me what the Scott Adams goof is?

27:32.840 --> 27:34.840
Dilbert's tight as fuck, though, because he's got a boner.

27:36.840 --> 27:40.680
I think it was that just Scott Adams just hates women so much

27:40.680 --> 27:41.800
and he just doesn't know what to do.

27:42.520 --> 27:43.080
Here we go.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.960
Scott Adams hates women so much, he doesn't know what to do with that hate.

27:45.960 --> 27:49.160
So instead he turns to krumping to get his misogyny out.

27:49.160 --> 27:53.960
Go. Ah, my pen's almost dry, running out of ink.

27:53.960 --> 27:59.320
I can't believe my bitch of a wife forgot to buy more ink at the ink store.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.000
Ah, my pen's drying up.

28:01.000 --> 28:01.560
I hate her.

28:01.560 --> 28:02.280
I can't draw.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.480
Flip the thighs.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.560
Somebody give me- Ah, there we go.

28:06.120 --> 28:08.760
Ah, I gotta get this energy out somehow.

28:08.760 --> 28:09.880
I gotta shake it.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.560
Ah, I got ink all over me.

28:11.560 --> 28:12.680
There's ink all over the room.

28:12.680 --> 28:14.600
Why am I still holding the ink container?

28:15.240 --> 28:16.840
Ah, I'm gonna eat my pen.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.960
I wanna hold it between my teeth as I practice my chest pops.

28:19.960 --> 28:20.440
That's it.

28:20.440 --> 28:23.800
My chest pops are good enough I'm just doing chest pops the rest of the day.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.520
Hey, you bitch, get in here and watch me.

28:26.520 --> 28:27.960
Watch me crump, you whore.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.120
I gotta get this to my editor.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.360
I'm tired all day long.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.400
Scott Adams.

28:37.720 --> 28:38.040
Thank you.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.440
Happy birthday, I guess.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.920
We got another message for Deborah.

28:42.920 --> 28:45.000
This one's from Andrea and Mike.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.400
Travis, what are we talking about?

28:47.400 --> 28:48.200
What's going on for Deborah?

28:48.200 --> 28:53.240
Well, Andrea and Mike want to congratulate Deborah on her new grown-up job as a reporter.

28:54.600 --> 28:58.920
She's a rad friend, a brilliant journalist, and a huge My Brother My Brother Me fan,

28:58.920 --> 29:01.400
and North Battleford's answer to April O'Neil.

29:02.280 --> 29:05.400
They wish that she lived closer so they could celebrate properly,

29:05.400 --> 29:11.880
but the consolation is that they now have a professional to investigate their gruesome

29:11.880 --> 29:15.720
murders and or sex scandals should they occur.

29:15.720 --> 29:21.960
So that is that it's so important to pre-select the investigative reporter

29:21.960 --> 29:25.320
that will become obsessed with hunting you across this great land of ours.

29:25.320 --> 29:29.880
What happens if they if they overturn a gruesome sex scandal?

29:29.880 --> 29:30.280
Oh no.

29:31.800 --> 29:35.560
What if things get real sloppy in North Battleford?

29:37.560 --> 29:40.520
If you'd like to, ugh, ugh.

29:40.520 --> 29:40.920
What's wrong?

29:40.920 --> 29:45.240
Grossed. I'm fully grossed now, but congratulations to you, Deborah.

29:45.240 --> 29:52.440
You've worked hard for this, and we hope that someday you get to tell our story, but just not.

29:52.440 --> 29:53.800
If we sex murder each other.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.560
If we sex murder each other.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.600
If you'd like to have us deliver a special message to somebody you care about,

29:58.600 --> 30:05.320
go to MaximumFun.org forward slash Jumbotron and we'll get that all sorted out for you.

30:05.320 --> 30:08.760
Jesse Thorne here, proprietor of MaximumFun.org.

30:08.760 --> 30:14.360
Look, we had a great time in the Poconos and everything, but there's no way we are forgetting

30:14.360 --> 30:18.600
about our annual trip to Lake Arrowhead here in Southern California.

30:18.600 --> 30:25.480
So unless the world ends first by Mayan prophecy, Max Fun Con West will be held May 31st through

30:25.480 --> 30:27.720
June 2nd, 2013.

30:27.720 --> 30:31.640
Join us for a showcase of elite stand up comedy performers in the world,

30:31.640 --> 30:35.640
join us for a showcase of elite stand up comedy performers in the woods,

30:35.640 --> 30:40.680
plus informative classes and talks from some of the best creative minds in the nation.

30:40.680 --> 30:44.360
If you've been to Max Fun Con before, get ready to reunite with your old friends.

30:44.360 --> 30:48.440
And if you're a first timer, get ready to make a whole ton of new ones.

30:48.440 --> 30:54.280
Registration will open up on Black Friday, November 23rd, the day after Thanksgiving

30:54.280 --> 30:56.360
at MaxFunCon.com.

30:56.360 --> 31:00.840
It's basically the greatest holiday present anyone could ever get.

31:00.840 --> 31:06.760
Act fast, Max Fun Con pretty much always sells out and we don't expect this year to be any different.

31:06.760 --> 31:26.840
So Black Friday at MaxFunCon.com.

31:26.840 --> 31:31.400
Hey guys, I currently rent a small house within a bigger suburban neighborhood and I've been

31:31.400 --> 31:33.160
renting for some time.

31:33.160 --> 31:40.440
It's a great place, but in front of it is this big pecan tree right over my driveway.

31:40.440 --> 31:44.120
This morning, guys, this is a long question, but please stick with me.

31:44.120 --> 31:50.440
This morning I saw a little bit older Chinese woman walking around down the street.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.880
Turns out she was stealing my nuts from my yard.

31:53.880 --> 31:58.600
When I confronted her about what she was doing, she simply sort of giggled and sort of motioned

31:58.600 --> 32:00.080
the bag towards me.

32:00.080 --> 32:04.280
This went on for a minute or two, me asking what she was doing and us obviously not communicating

32:04.280 --> 32:06.920
that she was bagging my nuts and it was weird.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.840
Brothers, did I do the right thing to confront me?

32:09.840 --> 32:14.720
She obviously wasn't an English-speaking woman, but she was stealing stuff from my yard.

32:14.720 --> 32:19.440
Would it be different if it was a lemon or apple tree or is it the same level of sin

32:19.440 --> 32:24.120
if it was a bunch of kids that didn't know better and that's from Nutty in Houston.

32:24.120 --> 32:26.880
I'm so confused.

32:26.880 --> 32:37.580
So basically, is the fruit from a tree that falls into your yard, is it fair game for

32:37.580 --> 32:42.760
people to just snatch up and get the vitamins?

32:42.760 --> 32:49.560
From what I've always understood is if it grows in your yard and has juice in it, then

32:49.560 --> 32:52.000
it is your property.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.600
If there's juice, let it be.

32:55.600 --> 32:59.000
I couldn't make that round, I guess.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.280
But nuts, I think, are pretty much fair game because nuts are pretty much like leaves,

33:04.280 --> 33:05.280
you know?

33:05.280 --> 33:07.880
They're just like a part of the tree and it's weird that we eat them in the first place.

33:07.880 --> 33:12.280
Yeah, because where you draw the line, like some kids coming and throwing acorns at each

33:12.280 --> 33:15.240
other and you're like, hey, those are my acorns.

33:15.240 --> 33:22.760
That said, pecan halves at my local H-E-B are like $9 for a half pound bag, so she is

33:22.760 --> 33:24.800
basically taking money from you.

33:24.800 --> 33:25.800
Yes.

33:25.800 --> 33:26.800
That's your money.

33:26.800 --> 33:33.760
You probably water that pecan tree from a sapling, so you could have these pecans, so

33:33.760 --> 33:38.600
you can have the protein and unsaturated fats, so you could keep yourself from getting gallstones.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.120
No, it doesn't matter.

33:40.120 --> 33:42.240
But here's my question, you guys.

33:42.240 --> 33:45.320
Why isn't he out there collecting the nuts himself?

33:45.320 --> 33:46.320
That is a great question.

33:46.320 --> 33:47.320
Well, maybe he's busy.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.080
Well, then he doesn't get to complain about someone else taking the nuts when they're

33:50.080 --> 33:52.000
sitting on the ground just rotting.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.320
Now she's like scaled your tree and picking them from the tree.

33:55.320 --> 33:56.320
That's bullshit.

33:56.320 --> 33:57.320
Okay.

33:57.320 --> 34:02.040
But if you start washing your car, but then you go inside because Earth Girls Are Easy

34:02.040 --> 34:05.480
is on on TBS, nobody can fucking come steal your car.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.720
It's not different.

34:07.720 --> 34:10.560
Your car isn't scattered around your yard.

34:10.560 --> 34:15.720
And yes, someone would steal your car if it was scattered around your yard.

34:15.720 --> 34:16.720
In pieces, you mean?

34:16.720 --> 34:17.720
Sure.

34:17.720 --> 34:20.680
Somebody like finds a rear view mirror and just takes it?

34:20.680 --> 34:25.160
I mean, if you want to get specific, yes.

34:25.160 --> 34:30.180
This irks me because I think it does definitely, definitely matter that it's an older Chinese

34:30.180 --> 34:34.480
woman that's doing it because if it was like if it was a bunch of kids, you could just

34:34.480 --> 34:35.480
shout them out.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.480
You could shout them off your yard.

34:36.480 --> 34:37.480
Get off my yard.

34:37.480 --> 34:38.480
Those are my pecans.

34:38.480 --> 34:39.480
You little shits.

34:39.480 --> 34:43.500
But you can't do that to somebody who's older than you.

34:43.500 --> 34:45.600
That's true.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.640
And someone who's another nationality for me.

34:47.640 --> 34:50.480
You can't do it to somebody who's more Chinese than you are.

34:50.480 --> 34:56.320
If someone is more Chinese than me or any nationality, more Asian, more Italian, and

34:56.320 --> 35:02.480
older than me, I assume that if I cross them, they will put a curse on me.

35:02.480 --> 35:03.480
Maybe an Italian curse.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.480
Just until you die.

35:04.480 --> 35:05.480
Holy shit.

35:05.480 --> 35:06.480
Yeah.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.480
I don't want to-

35:07.480 --> 35:08.480
That's not great.

35:08.480 --> 35:11.020
No, is that not worth like-

35:11.020 --> 35:13.200
Saying out loud on the internet?

35:13.200 --> 35:14.200
What?

35:14.200 --> 35:18.480
That I'm afraid anyone who's not white is going to put a curse on me?

35:18.480 --> 35:21.160
I don't think that's so wrong.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.160
I think that's a pretty common assumption.

35:22.160 --> 35:27.480
I'm just afraid he's going to sip his army of Mogwai on me and I'll let him get the nuts.

35:27.480 --> 35:36.040
I can't help it that I was raised in an era of cinema in which old Chinese men, all they

35:36.040 --> 35:43.200
did was sell you kindly things that would turn into monsters, and all the Indian men

35:43.200 --> 35:48.000
were actually Fisher Stevens in brownface.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.400
This was the age.

35:50.400 --> 35:53.560
This was the era of cinema that I can't-

35:53.560 --> 35:55.320
This puzzle box looks like a lot of fun.

35:55.320 --> 35:58.640
Oh, it's a portal to a sex pain dimension?

35:58.640 --> 35:59.640
Thanks.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.640
Thank you.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.680
I wanted to get my flesh ripped with hooks.

36:02.680 --> 36:05.000
This is fun.

36:05.000 --> 36:11.840
I can't help it that I also think that all old people should climb into cocoons and they'll

36:11.840 --> 36:14.760
be rejuvenated.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.520
That's my era.

36:16.520 --> 36:17.520
That's my baggage.

36:17.520 --> 36:19.520
That's my load to carry.

36:19.520 --> 36:26.800
I was on a walk with my Jeef the other day and we came across some pecan trees in a park

36:26.800 --> 36:29.680
and there was just pecans laying on the ground and this is the first time I've ever done

36:29.680 --> 36:30.680
anything like this.

36:30.680 --> 36:31.680
I don't know why.

36:31.680 --> 36:35.000
Maybe I was trying to impress her, but I just picked one up off the ground and shucked it

36:35.000 --> 36:38.880
and I ate the sweet nuts inside, just off the ground.

36:38.880 --> 36:40.200
What the fuck you'll give him?

36:40.200 --> 36:43.360
How did you identify a pecan from sight?

36:43.360 --> 36:47.840
Because one was already cracked and I could see the wrinkled nut inside and normal nuts

36:47.840 --> 36:48.840
aren't wrinkled.

36:48.840 --> 36:49.840
You know that's a pecan.

36:49.840 --> 36:53.480
And so I just ate it and it tasted like a pecan and then I knew I was in the clear.

36:53.480 --> 36:56.600
Jesus Christ, Griffin.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.160
I went on a yum voyage.

36:58.160 --> 36:59.160
I would suggest everybody do it.

36:59.160 --> 37:03.800
Yeah, because you were probably tripping on deadly nightshade or something.

37:03.800 --> 37:11.640
Also, there was an old woman who was wondering on picking them up, so I figured it was probably

37:11.640 --> 37:12.640
safer.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.960
Oh, well, I mean that's fine.

37:14.960 --> 37:19.160
If her old ass constitution can handle what those nuts are going to do when they ravage

37:19.160 --> 37:21.920
her body, I imagine that I probably could too.

37:21.920 --> 37:24.040
Yeah, there's no doubt about that.

37:24.040 --> 37:29.880
Hey, can we do a Yahoo that you want to drop on us because I got another question if not.

37:29.880 --> 37:30.880
Yeah, sure.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.680
This one was sent in by Andrew Kaplan.

37:32.680 --> 37:33.680
Thank you, Andrew.

37:33.680 --> 37:40.140
It's by Yahoo Answers user, The Maverick, who asks, question on old man strength.

37:40.140 --> 37:41.800
Is there a science behind this?

37:41.800 --> 37:46.840
You know, those old guys between the ages of 40 and 50 who look weak, but when you wrestle

37:46.840 --> 37:50.720
them or box them, it feels like you're going against an animal.

37:50.720 --> 37:55.400
They may not be able to bench press or squat a whole lot, but they are still incredibly

37:55.400 --> 38:00.560
powerful.

38:00.560 --> 38:05.840
How often is this coming up in this gentleman's life?

38:05.840 --> 38:12.680
Why is this such an issue for you that you have to ask Yahoo about, you keep trying to,

38:12.680 --> 38:15.680
is this like a, I don't think that this guy just fights people.

38:15.680 --> 38:17.040
I think he just fights old men.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.520
He's like, I can get this one.

38:18.520 --> 38:20.160
Oh yeah, I got this guy.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.520
Guys, come watch, come watch you do this.

38:22.520 --> 38:23.520
I'm going to get him.

38:23.520 --> 38:26.520
I'm going to beat up Mimo.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.800
Mimo is what he calls his, his poppy.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.640
Is he just trying to fight his own poppy?

38:31.640 --> 38:35.200
Aren't we all?

38:35.200 --> 38:38.360
They say that man's greatest struggle in life is to best his own father.

38:38.360 --> 38:41.760
This guy is, is vaulting over that goal.

38:41.760 --> 38:42.760
Right.

38:42.760 --> 38:49.340
He's hunting those dangerous game, the most dangerous and most satisfying game.

38:49.340 --> 38:50.680
It's poppy.

38:50.680 --> 38:53.920
They call it the greatest generation because when you beat the shit out of one of them,

38:53.920 --> 38:57.760
you're like, oh fuck, yeah, yeah, this is going down great.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.760
You beat Hitler and I beat you.

38:59.760 --> 39:03.400
So by association, I just beat the shit out of Hitler.

39:03.400 --> 39:06.720
That level of punch out is just you fighting Jacqueline Lane.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.000
Uh huh.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.760
Just get, who was the one who had the juicer?

39:10.760 --> 39:13.400
I bet I couldn't take, I couldn't have taken that guy.

39:13.400 --> 39:18.360
That was a, no, it was a King Hippo.

39:18.360 --> 39:20.280
It was King Hippo.

39:20.280 --> 39:23.000
It was the juice man.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.480
You know, the juice man, Jay Cordish, horse marijuana.

39:27.480 --> 39:30.320
Jay Cordish is the juice man.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.880
Maybe Jacqueline did a juicer too though.

39:31.880 --> 39:34.020
I can't remember.

39:34.020 --> 39:35.020
I don't understand.

39:35.020 --> 39:38.760
I don't understand how it happened because I'm, I just, I, I'm 25.

39:38.760 --> 39:44.120
I'm six months into 25 now and I, I feel like I'm fucking 88 years old.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.600
Like my body has already started.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.120
It's already peaked and has already started decomposing.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.760
I don't know how these fucking guys do it.

39:51.760 --> 39:55.120
The old men, the old steroids.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.120
The olders.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.120
Yeah.

39:57.120 --> 39:58.600
I don't have any energy right now.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.360
How are they getting up and fighting people?

40:00.360 --> 40:01.360
Yeah.

40:01.360 --> 40:05.000
There's a certain kick of energy that comes from like knowing that you're, you've got

40:05.000 --> 40:08.960
nothing left to prove, like, you know, you're on the slow descent to like, what are you

40:08.960 --> 40:09.960
afraid of?

40:09.960 --> 40:11.160
You're going to break a bone.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.320
You're going to die.

40:12.320 --> 40:14.400
Like they have fear of death.

40:14.400 --> 40:18.940
But they should, but they should because they're more likely to do those things than we are.

40:18.940 --> 40:22.300
If I get punched in the arm, I'm probably not going to break every bone in my body.

40:22.300 --> 40:24.380
You know what I mean?

40:24.380 --> 40:30.080
If I live long enough, will I eventually stop being afraid of death?

40:30.080 --> 40:31.080
Is that the secret?

40:31.080 --> 40:32.080
Yeah.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.080
That they've conquered.

40:33.080 --> 40:38.920
Listen, I also think we need to accept that back in the day, the poppy age, you know,

40:38.920 --> 40:43.480
that generation, they were just more hardcore than we are.

40:43.480 --> 40:46.320
Ooh, interesting.

40:46.320 --> 40:55.300
So they, they being raised on fighting Hitler and like cabbage rations and stuff like that,

40:55.300 --> 40:58.080
that made them like wicked, just like crazy tough.

40:58.080 --> 41:01.320
They were basically like all captain Americas.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.320
Okay.

41:02.320 --> 41:03.320
Well, okay.

41:03.320 --> 41:04.320
Okay.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.320
That makes a lot of sense.

41:05.320 --> 41:08.800
It's not their age so much as the, the ground from which their manhood blossomed.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.800
Oh my God.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.800
The fertile soil.

41:10.800 --> 41:17.000
If you balance like a 25 year old dude from like 1940 versus a 25 year old dude now, it

41:17.000 --> 41:19.560
would be like a 25 year old dude now fighting a baby.

41:19.560 --> 41:20.560
Oh my God.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.560
Yeah.

41:21.560 --> 41:25.240
It would be like, Hey, have you read the new, uh, Chuck Palahniuk book?

41:25.240 --> 41:26.240
And then he would die.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.240
Cause he got punched so hard.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.240
Yeah.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.240
He had eyelashes.

41:29.240 --> 41:31.040
Yeah.

41:31.040 --> 41:32.040
You looked at me hard.

41:32.040 --> 41:33.300
I'm going to live journal this.

41:33.300 --> 41:36.800
You just ripped the fields off her lucky strike and just smoked it.

41:36.800 --> 41:37.800
Wow.

41:37.800 --> 41:38.800
You're a tough guy.

41:38.800 --> 41:42.240
So imagine how bad it will be in like 50 years from now.

41:42.240 --> 41:45.360
Oh, our kids are going to beat the shit out of us.

41:45.360 --> 41:46.360
Are you kidding me?

41:46.360 --> 41:48.640
You think of the pendulum strings going to go the other way?

41:48.640 --> 41:49.640
Oh my God.

41:49.640 --> 41:50.640
Yeah.

41:50.640 --> 41:55.440
I think that, I think that like fortitude skipped a human generation or at least an

41:55.440 --> 42:00.920
American generation because like my kids are going to have to fight over, you know, rare

42:00.920 --> 42:04.880
earth elements against every other country in the universe.

42:04.880 --> 42:07.040
And then they are going to be like super tough.

42:07.040 --> 42:10.120
And then I'm going to be like, Hey, do you want some quiche?

42:10.120 --> 42:12.640
And then they're going to fucking curb stomp me.

42:12.640 --> 42:13.640
Yeah.

42:13.640 --> 42:15.840
Hey guys, welcome home for Thanksgiving.

42:15.840 --> 42:18.280
I made you a fist face.

42:18.280 --> 42:22.160
I just finished beating up Osama bin Laden too.

42:22.160 --> 42:28.640
I'm looking forward to the terrorist sequels that we're going to, that genetic cloning

42:28.640 --> 42:29.640
is going to bring us.

42:29.640 --> 42:30.640
I'm really excited.

42:30.640 --> 42:31.640
Beware!

42:31.640 --> 42:32.640
It's son of Hitler.

42:32.640 --> 42:33.640
Uh huh.

42:33.640 --> 42:34.640
It's pride of just girls.

42:34.640 --> 42:35.640
It is mega Stalin.

42:35.640 --> 42:36.640
Mega Stalin.

42:36.640 --> 42:37.640
I liked it when you made that joke, Trav.

42:37.640 --> 42:38.640
Thank you, Justin.

42:38.640 --> 42:47.640
I liked it when you laughed at the joke that I made.

42:47.640 --> 42:54.600
Guys, I'm so thankful for both of you.

42:54.600 --> 42:55.600
Yeah.

42:55.600 --> 42:58.960
And all of our jokes that we got going on right now.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.240
We're all thankful for each other.

43:00.240 --> 43:05.360
Most of all, we're thankful for you for joining us yet again for my brother, my brother, me.

43:05.360 --> 43:06.400
Real quick.

43:06.400 --> 43:10.720
Got a ton of great presents for our B day.

43:10.720 --> 43:19.560
We got a joke, a joke book sent to us from not great penmanship.

43:19.560 --> 43:22.280
I'm going to say Jason is what that looks like.

43:22.280 --> 43:23.280
A very kind note.

43:23.280 --> 43:25.120
Are you sure it's not Jarman?

43:25.120 --> 43:27.040
It might be Jarflin.

43:27.040 --> 43:33.960
I got a novel, a dirty job by Christopher Moore and that's for Griffin.

43:33.960 --> 43:37.280
I don't know why Griffin got a present, but probably because he sent us other things.

43:37.280 --> 43:43.920
He sent me a copy of a book called The Windup Girl and said Travis, Jim Butcher's side jobs.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.320
Stories from the Dresden Files.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.760
Good choice.

43:47.760 --> 43:48.760
Excellent choice.

43:48.760 --> 43:54.520
We also got a ghost meter EMF sensor from Alan Black.

43:54.520 --> 43:55.520
Holy shit.

43:55.520 --> 43:59.600
Chris is going to be spooktacular.

43:59.600 --> 44:05.600
And Nico Jerema, Nico Jerema sent us a copy of Captain Underpants and the wrath of the

44:05.600 --> 44:07.560
wicked wedgie woman.

44:07.560 --> 44:10.160
So do appreciate that.

44:10.160 --> 44:12.760
And we got so much more.

44:12.760 --> 44:14.760
I tell you about the wedding we're invited to, right?

44:14.760 --> 44:15.760
Yes.

44:15.760 --> 44:17.260
Spill the beans on that.

44:17.260 --> 44:18.540
That's in Chi-Town, right?

44:18.540 --> 44:19.540
That's in Chi-Town.

44:19.540 --> 44:20.540
Let me know the date.

44:20.540 --> 44:22.120
Let me know the venue.

44:22.120 --> 44:30.080
I respectfully told them we wouldn't be able to make it, but I did send them a very nice

44:30.080 --> 44:35.520
set of drinking glasses and also, I believe, a peeler.

44:35.520 --> 44:38.720
This is the nicest fucking podcast ever.

44:38.720 --> 44:44.520
Basically, everybody loves everybody on the show, but thank you so much for those birthday

44:44.520 --> 44:45.520
presents from everybody.

44:45.520 --> 44:50.640
I haven't been to the post office in a little while, so if you sent one recently, I'm sorry

44:50.640 --> 44:54.520
that we did not receive it yet.

44:54.520 --> 44:59.920
We're part of the Maximum Fun Network, and they have a ton of shows that you will really

44:59.920 --> 45:00.920
enjoy.

There's Risk, there's Throwing Shade, Just John Hodgman, Jordan and Jesse Go, Bullseye

45:06.960 --> 45:12.820
is one of the best interview shows ever, and you could be listening to it for free right

45:12.820 --> 45:16.840

45:16.840 --> 45:18.800
they've got on offer.

45:18.800 --> 45:21.440
Next time you're about to buy some shit to keep yourself entertained, next time you're

45:21.440 --> 45:26.840
about to buy yourself a trifle, just think, or a rifle, just think about, or a trident.

45:26.840 --> 45:27.840
Thank you, Travis.

45:27.840 --> 45:30.880
Justin, do you want to chime in, or should I just keep going?

45:30.880 --> 45:32.600
No, go for it.

45:32.600 --> 45:36.040
Just think about all the free shit that you can get on MaximumFun.org.

45:36.040 --> 45:38.880

45:57.900 --> 46:08.440
the show, if you can just tell a friend, Adam J. Ford, Little Socrates, or is that Socrates?

46:08.440 --> 46:14.560
Thank you to you guys, you're what help us to grow the show, so we really, really appreciate

46:14.560 --> 46:15.560
it.

46:15.560 --> 46:19.440
Please tell some friends if you can, if you get a chance, burn our shit onto a CD, give

46:19.440 --> 46:24.080
it to a friend, pick your favorite one hour episode, burn it onto a one hour disc, give

46:24.080 --> 46:27.040
it to somebody as the ultimate gift, or give them a jump drive.

46:27.040 --> 46:31.560
That'd be a great present for whatever holiday you celebrate.

46:31.560 --> 46:34.280
Just get a jump drive, feel that bitch.

46:34.280 --> 46:41.120
Did you know that you can get one of two different styles of My Brother, My Brother and Me shirts?

46:41.120 --> 46:47.360
They're all at MaxFunStore, and you can just get them, you know?

46:47.360 --> 46:50.560
I also want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

46:50.560 --> 46:52.840
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

46:52.840 --> 46:56.680
I cannot wait for that Fool's Holiday album to drop.

46:56.680 --> 46:57.680
Can't wait.

46:57.680 --> 46:58.680
Can't wait.

46:58.680 --> 47:00.480
It's gonna be so good.

47:00.480 --> 47:02.600
So yeah, thank you so much, everybody.

47:02.600 --> 47:04.160
Can't wait for Candle Nights.

47:04.160 --> 47:05.280
Candle Nights coming up so fast.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.280
Are you guys ready?

47:06.280 --> 47:12.820
Yeah, our always, our always underwhelming holiday episode.

47:12.820 --> 47:15.360
Be sure to catch that, don't wanna miss that.

47:15.360 --> 47:19.160
Have you guys trimmed the whatever it is that you trim for Candle Nights?

47:19.160 --> 47:20.160
The bush?

47:20.160 --> 47:22.200
I guess, I think there's a bush.

47:22.200 --> 47:24.960
No, Travis means stone bush.

47:24.960 --> 47:28.400
Hey, Griff, did you have another question?

47:28.400 --> 47:29.880
One last one to send us off on?

47:29.880 --> 47:30.880
Yeah, I could.

47:30.880 --> 47:32.240
I could do that for you.

47:32.240 --> 47:35.840
This was sent in by Nolan Hitchcock.

47:35.840 --> 47:36.840
Thank you, Nolan.

47:36.840 --> 47:45.080
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Jessica, who asks, is it bad to give my six-year-old baby a little

47:45.080 --> 47:46.960
French onion dip?

47:46.960 --> 47:49.640
Oh, Justin McElroy.

47:49.640 --> 47:51.640
I'm Griffin McElroy.

47:51.640 --> 47:54.600
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

47:54.600 --> 47:56.200
That's your dad, square on the lips.
