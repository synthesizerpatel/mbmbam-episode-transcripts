00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:48.400
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and Advice Show for the modern era.

00:48.400 --> 00:52.480
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.480 --> 00:57.760
I'm your baby brother, Griffin. We're live here from the show floor of San Diego Comic Con,

00:57.760 --> 01:05.440
where we have just witnessed the reveal of Thor 2, Hammer of Thor. Travis, what was your takeaway?

01:05.440 --> 01:10.320
I- the floor is abuzz, Justin. The floor is on Thor. I tell you what,

01:10.320 --> 01:12.960
we can't stop talking about it over here in the booth.

01:12.960 --> 01:17.440
Now, is it true that they- Griffin, is it true they've started taking- calling the show floor

01:17.440 --> 01:23.920
the show Thor just because that's how ever-present Thor fever is at the San Diego Comic Con?

01:23.920 --> 01:29.760
Mjolnir? I don't even know her. Good one, Griffin. Good one.

01:29.760 --> 01:33.200
Jokes like this are some of the many jokes that you'll hear.

01:33.200 --> 01:38.560
Thor-related, Thor-centric, everyone is talking about Thor.

01:38.560 --> 01:42.480
Over here at the Stan Lee booth, he's already talking about his cameo appearance

01:42.480 --> 01:45.200
as that guy who turns around and says one sentence.

01:46.400 --> 01:51.040
Travis, you watched 30 to 40 seconds of teaser footage.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.680
What were some of the big takeaways that you noticed?

01:53.680 --> 02:00.480
There was hammering, there was some lightning, he looked dreamy, there was a swirling cloud.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.920
I think of something- I wasn't really paying attention. I thought it would be longer.

02:03.920 --> 02:07.360
I looked away to get some popcorn. When I came back, it was over.

02:07.360 --> 02:12.000
I read on coolthorblog.com that Loki's up to his old tricks. Confirm or deny?

02:12.000 --> 02:18.480
Oh, no way. He was there, but I could not tell of what quality his tricks were.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.280
Tell me about Skrull X. Skrull X was awesome.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.720
Skrull- sorry.

02:22.720 --> 02:23.920
What?

02:23.920 --> 02:25.120
Skrull X.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.000
Skrull X, is that a Skrull DJ?

02:30.000 --> 02:33.680
He's a monster. He's a monster in the new Thor movie.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.960
Thor 2, Hammer of Thor, out summer 2013. I'm excited.

02:37.680 --> 02:44.320
Thor 2, Hammer of Thor, out summer 2013. Is it true that they've taken to cooking

02:44.320 --> 02:47.840
s'mores there at the show floor and calling them Thors?

02:47.840 --> 02:50.400
They've called them s'mores? They call them s'mores?

02:50.960 --> 02:51.840
S'mores?

02:51.840 --> 02:55.440
They call these- they call the treats S'morth, Justin.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.840
And they all have speech impediments. It's very embarrassing for them.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.240
All the Revengers are here. They're all cooking up.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.960
Fresh S'morth. There's Metal Man.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.720
The- the folk. The folk is there.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.400
The folk is there, I hear.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.680
There's Meat Man and Metal Man and Kit Girl.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.680
Captain USA is there.

03:15.680 --> 03:20.720
Uh, fresh off- fresh off, uh, fresh off his new movie success,

03:20.720 --> 03:24.560
Andrew Garfield is on the show floor in costume as the Flipster.

03:24.560 --> 03:30.400
He's flipping around, uh, websing- websing any size of foe, uh,

03:30.400 --> 03:33.200
and then all this is going on at the San Diego Comic Con,

03:33.200 --> 03:35.440
and we are live on the show floor of it.

03:35.440 --> 03:35.840
The show Thor.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.720
On the quietest corner that we could find on the floor.

03:38.720 --> 03:41.440
We managed to hide inside a burrito booth.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.000
Can we give some advice now?

03:46.000 --> 03:46.240
Yep.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.640
Don't go to San Diego Comic Con.

03:48.640 --> 03:49.760
Stop.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.720
Every- everything I hear about San Diego Comic Con,

03:52.720 --> 03:54.160
it makes it look like a nightmare.

03:54.160 --> 03:54.560
I had no-

03:54.560 --> 03:57.040
You know what, you say that till I see pictures of people, like,

03:57.040 --> 04:01.600
hanging out with the Mythbusters and hanging out with Mark Hamill.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.240
And there was-

04:02.240 --> 04:04.560
Mostly that's just, like, Chuck Bryant.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.200
Yeah, our friend- our dear friend Chuck Bryant did post a, uh,

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
post a, uh, a picture of himself hanging out with John Noble of, uh, fringe fame.

04:14.000 --> 04:14.160
So-

04:14.160 --> 04:17.840
From what I can tell, Chuck Bryant just has, like, the best life.

04:17.840 --> 04:18.400
Yeah.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.880
He's, like, living every person's dream.

04:20.880 --> 04:21.520
Yeah.

04:21.520 --> 04:22.800
He's living like he was dying.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.480
He's getting it.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.160
He's getting it into what he does.

04:26.160 --> 04:30.160
Uh, let's- let's get some advice, uh, answered, given.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.960
Let's give some advi- ah, Christ.

04:32.960 --> 04:33.760
Let's advice it.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.600
Let's advice around.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.720
Last August, my girlfriend of seven years dumped me.

04:39.600 --> 04:43.120
The worst part is that she was my concert-going buddy,

04:43.120 --> 04:46.560
and all my friends are too busy or money-conscious to go to shows with me.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.880
I haven't lost my luster for live music,

04:48.880 --> 04:53.440
and would still like to go to shows when I can without relying on having company.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.120
Problem is, I don't want to be the creepy dude

04:55.120 --> 04:58.480
at the Dave Matthews Band Show standing by myself.

04:58.480 --> 05:01.120
Is it okay to go to concerts alone?

05:01.840 --> 05:05.760
If it is, what can I do to feel like less of a creeper?

05:05.760 --> 05:08.080
And that's from a real indie rocker in Indiana.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.320
Well, let me just clear this off right off the bat.

05:10.320 --> 05:13.360
You are not the creepiest dude at the Dave Matthews concert.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.080
Oh, man.

05:14.080 --> 05:14.880
You're rotate.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.720
There are going to be people who are way, way creepier than you.

05:19.440 --> 05:22.240
There are people in the band that are creepier than you.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.600
Look to your left.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.720
Look to your right.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.760
One of these people smells like Cheetos.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.080
Both of them have devil sticks.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.080
Both of them are operating devil sticks.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.080
Yeah, you have no worries at the Dave Matthews Band Show.

05:36.080 --> 05:40.720
In fact, there are probably concerts that you're gonna fit in better

05:40.720 --> 05:42.880
because there's more of a communal vibe, right?

05:42.880 --> 05:47.760
You go to a Dave Matthews Band Show, a reunited fish show,

05:47.760 --> 05:51.760
perhaps a wavy gravy tribute.

05:51.760 --> 05:57.760
Maybe go to Modest Yahoo and see what his thing is.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.680
Is he still on the set?

05:59.680 --> 06:00.320
Oh, he's still good.

06:00.320 --> 06:01.360
He just had another big hit.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.520
He's had another big hit.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.360
It is Modest Yahoo, right?

06:05.360 --> 06:06.800
It is Modest Yahoo.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.120
Humble Yahoo.

06:09.120 --> 06:14.240
Yeah, so I think that those sorts of communal concerts

06:14.240 --> 06:16.720
would probably be a better fit if you want to go by yourself.

06:16.720 --> 06:20.640
I mean, can I be honest with you guys?

06:20.640 --> 06:21.120
Yeah, you don't like concerts.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.040
I am a person in general.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.520
I just don't get concerts.

06:26.240 --> 06:29.600
Like, there are special occasion concerts.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.280
There's stuff like the concert we went to with Regina Specter

06:33.280 --> 06:34.960
and They Might Be Giants.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.400
That was great.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.400
Seeing Mike Doty in concert.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.200
Like, that was incredible.

06:40.160 --> 06:44.640
You and me saw a show with Amos Lee, Costello, and Dylan.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.600
That was great.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.800
That's a big special event.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.640
I saw Pavement before they really got big.

06:50.640 --> 06:51.760
Yeah, me too.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.160
Let me think.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.840
That was like, 92.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.640
I saw a show with Electric Six and Junior Senior.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.880
It was the most amazing show I've ever been to.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.240
So you do like concerts.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.640
But no, but the idea of sitting there around a weekend

07:04.640 --> 07:07.200
and be like, do you guys want to go see a concert tonight?

07:07.200 --> 07:10.080
And like finding, you know, searching one out

07:10.080 --> 07:11.520
and purposefully going.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.120
It's usually like some big deal.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.320
I would say in my life, I've maybe gone to 20 concerts.

07:16.320 --> 07:16.800
Yeah.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.080
In my 28 years.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.960
That's the big appeal of festivals to me.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.160
And I would definitely go to those alone.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.880
Because then you don't have, you don't,

07:26.880 --> 07:29.440
like if you want to leave a show 20 minutes in,

07:29.440 --> 07:32.000
you're not going to have any baggage there, you know?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.240
If you want to go to the bathroom twice

07:34.880 --> 07:36.480
during the Modest Yahoo concert,

07:36.480 --> 07:38.080
there's not going to be a friend there who's like,

07:38.080 --> 07:39.520
fucking really, dog?

07:40.320 --> 07:41.280
Really, man?

07:41.280 --> 07:42.720
We've been here for 30 minutes.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.320
What have you been eating?

07:46.240 --> 07:52.320
That's really my big concern is standing in a hot room

07:52.320 --> 07:53.600
with a lot of people.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.880
Sometimes you got to take a break.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.240
Sometimes you got to dip out.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.240
Can I make a call to arms of all the people

07:58.240 --> 08:00.000
that go to concerts and listen to our show?

08:01.280 --> 08:02.640
If there are seats available,

08:02.640 --> 08:04.240
if it's like a stadium or they're seating,

08:04.240 --> 08:05.680
don't don't stand up.

08:05.680 --> 08:06.960
Why are you standing up?

08:06.960 --> 08:08.160
You can enjoy it sitting down.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.200
Sitting down is so wonderful.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.080
No, you can't tell people.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.200
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.400
No, wait a minute.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.600
What are you saying, Travis?

08:13.600 --> 08:15.600
I'm saying that I hate standing up.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.480
There are seats there.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.360
I want to stay seated.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.120
But when everyone stands up in front of me

08:19.120 --> 08:23.040
and I can't see Harry Connick Jr. singing his heart out,

08:23.040 --> 08:24.160
like what the fuck?

08:24.160 --> 08:25.600
Weaving his web.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.080
Weaving his tapestry of narrative and melody.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.360
And he's doing a medley of Christmas songs

08:31.360 --> 08:33.840
and doing a trombone solo and doing it right,

08:33.840 --> 08:35.040
if you know what I mean.

08:35.040 --> 08:37.680
And I can't see it because everybody's on their feet.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.440
But let me pitch this to you, Travis.

08:41.680 --> 08:45.440
You're at the sold out stadium Delamitri concert, right?

08:46.080 --> 08:50.320
And he's laying down the would-be singles.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.840
He's laying down some tracks, Delamitri is.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.200
It is one man, Del.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.000
It's a man's name.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.800
And so Del is up there.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.920
He's doing his thing.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.360
And all of a sudden you hear the telltale

09:03.360 --> 09:05.520
Roll To Me intro pluckiness.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.400
Oh, Roll To Me's kicking in?

09:06.400 --> 09:08.480
Yeah, everyone's been sitting this whole time.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.160
You're telling me that you can resist that

09:10.160 --> 09:12.000
ba-da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

09:12.640 --> 09:16.720
You're telling me you can keep your ass in the seat.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.840
When you hear Roll To Me.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.840
I think there should be an immediate wave

09:21.840 --> 09:24.400
of people standing up like, I recognize this song.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.760
And then 20 seconds later,

09:25.760 --> 09:27.840
just a synchronized sitting back down.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.000
I think Spike should shoot out of the seat

09:30.000 --> 09:31.600
when Roll To Me comes on.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.600
Because if you're sitting on that song,

09:33.600 --> 09:35.440
the bad news, you're fucking dead.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.240
Poisoned seats.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.480
This shouldn't matter because you're a corpse.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.560
Yeah, your heart's not beating.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.920
It's not pumping blood.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.400
Okay, so how about in the circumstance

09:46.400 --> 09:47.840
that you're at the Delamitri concert

09:47.840 --> 09:49.920
and only then are you allowed to stand?

09:49.920 --> 09:53.760
You should always, like, I don't care if you want to sit

09:54.320 --> 09:56.880
and I don't care if you want to stand.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.280
What I care about is if I'm standing

09:59.280 --> 10:03.040
because I have rented this square for the evening.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.520
This is my real estate for the evening.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.640
If I want to stand and you want to be a grumpster

10:08.640 --> 10:09.920
because you're a lazy bones,

10:11.040 --> 10:11.920
that's where I run into issues.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.840
I feel like you're talking directly to me.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.760
Yeah, I mean, apparently.

10:15.760 --> 10:18.720
Like, I didn't know you had such bad taste in manners.

10:18.720 --> 10:19.520
No, it's not that.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.800
Like, we went and saw Foreigner, which was awesome.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.560
And Journey, which was awesome.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.800
Let's all list every single concert

10:28.800 --> 10:31.360
that we've gone to because it's charming

10:31.360 --> 10:32.560
and it's good radio.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.880
The first concert that I ever went to,

10:34.880 --> 10:39.280
I went with Justin when I think I was 15 and he was 18.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.360
And we went and saw Tom Jones.

10:42.160 --> 10:42.720
That was great.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.080
That was a great show.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.600
So is there more to that story or just-

10:45.600 --> 10:47.040
No, it starts there.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.520
You just wanted to sort of, I guess, brag?

10:49.520 --> 10:51.440
Does that count as bragging when you say

10:51.440 --> 10:52.960
I went to a Tom Jones concert?

10:53.600 --> 10:54.640
My brother.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.000
Guys, guess what?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.160
Check this out.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.600
I clipped my toenails yesterday.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.880
I don't want to brag, but-

11:02.880 --> 11:04.240
Hey guys, check this out.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.600
Check this story.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.080
I thought that it was time to change my oil,

11:08.080 --> 11:10.000
but I got like another 500 miles.

11:10.560 --> 11:11.520
Not a problem.

11:11.520 --> 11:12.880
I don't even have to worry about it right now.

11:14.160 --> 11:14.400
It can be-

11:14.400 --> 11:16.560
There are people out there that are real jealous of me right now.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.960
It can be a real bummer summer though

11:18.960 --> 11:22.160
when you're trying to get enthused about a concert.

11:22.160 --> 11:22.880
We went to-

11:22.880 --> 11:24.000
It's a big problem at festivals.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.600
Like, we went to Bonnaroo one year

11:25.600 --> 11:30.640
and they have all these different shows at the stage,

11:30.640 --> 11:31.760
one right after the other,

11:31.760 --> 11:33.920
and so everybody went and camped out for Radiohead,

11:33.920 --> 11:37.280
but Elvis Costello was playing two shows before Radiohead,

11:37.280 --> 11:40.880
and all these hipsters were laying down

11:40.880 --> 11:44.880
and saving up their dance juice for when Radiohead was on.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.440
It was like me and two 50-year-olds,

11:49.440 --> 11:51.760
the only ones standing for this Elvis Costello show,

11:51.760 --> 11:53.760
trying to groove because he had-

11:53.760 --> 11:56.000
Oh, who was the-?

11:56.000 --> 11:56.640
Toussaint?

11:56.640 --> 11:57.040
What's his-

11:57.040 --> 11:57.760
Allen Toussaint.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.800
Allen Toussaint up there.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.440
We were trying to groove to the New Orleans sound

12:01.440 --> 12:03.520
and all these hipsters were sleeping.

12:03.520 --> 12:04.960
Did you have a moment of recognition

12:04.960 --> 12:06.880
with the other 50-year-olds though?

12:06.880 --> 12:07.920
Did they see you and feel-

12:07.920 --> 12:09.360
Yeah, we had to.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.280
We had to, and we were actively dancing.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.960
We were dancing on the hipsters.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.520
If you can make it over our way,

12:15.520 --> 12:18.080
we've got some crispy balls of Pinot Gris,

12:18.640 --> 12:19.840
some rock shrimp,

12:19.840 --> 12:24.160
devein and shit if you want to come over and hang.

12:24.160 --> 12:24.880
Stand near us,

12:24.880 --> 12:27.040
we'll pop up in another bottle of this Pinot Gris.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.400
I think you just got to go with the consensus.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.000
If everybody's standing, you got to stand.

12:32.000 --> 12:32.640
If everyone's sitting-

12:32.640 --> 12:33.600
Was that the question?

12:33.600 --> 12:35.280
I can't remember the original question.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.400
Can you go to concerts by yourself?

12:36.400 --> 12:38.480
I say yes because it makes it inherently

12:38.480 --> 12:39.440
a stress-free experience.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.440
Now, if you're going to a Skrillex,

12:41.440 --> 12:43.040
if you're going to a Skrillex concert,

12:43.040 --> 12:44.560
or if you're going to a Girl Talk

12:44.560 --> 12:46.560
and there's going to be dancing and gyration and movement,

12:46.560 --> 12:47.600
why not take a few friends?

12:47.600 --> 12:50.000
Rub up, find out.

12:50.000 --> 12:50.880
What's underneath?

12:50.880 --> 12:52.880
What's underneath those Tommy H's?

12:52.880 --> 12:53.840
Let me check it.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.800
What would this feel like?

12:55.840 --> 12:57.520
Hey, Jenny, we've never talked about it.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.880
Let our bodies do the talking.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.560
Just let the dubstep take you.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.400
How about we jump to a Yahoo answer?

13:09.520 --> 13:15.200
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Kate Stull.

13:15.200 --> 13:15.760
Thank you, Kate.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.640
It's by Yahoo answer's user, Humphrey, who asks,

13:19.360 --> 13:22.080
will I ever need to wear my cap and gown again?

13:22.080 --> 13:23.760
I just graduated this year.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.120
What to do with the robe and cap?

13:25.920 --> 13:27.920
I was wondering if I would ever have an occasion

13:27.920 --> 13:30.960
to wear it again so that I should spend $35 on dry cleaning.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.200
It's not cheap to dry clean the stupid robe.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.720
My college regalia colors are different

13:34.720 --> 13:35.920
from my high school regalia colors,

13:35.920 --> 13:36.880
and I doubt that I could wear it

13:36.880 --> 13:38.480
to my college graduation ceremony.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.920
I was wondering if any of the following events

13:39.920 --> 13:40.880
would require a cap and gown

13:40.880 --> 13:42.320
or even permit me to wear one.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.080
And what would I wear to these different events?

13:44.080 --> 13:45.760
I will probably be attending this coming year.

13:45.760 --> 13:46.480
Am I clueless?

13:47.920 --> 13:48.560
And then there's some-

13:48.560 --> 13:50.400
All right, list the events.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.280
We'll vote.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.520
Thesis, presentation, and defense.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.720
I do not know what that is.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.440
It sounds like a power play, though,

13:57.440 --> 13:58.640
to wear a cap and gown.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.720
A formal academic award ceremony.

14:01.760 --> 14:02.400
Just the cap.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.080
And nothing else?

14:04.080 --> 14:04.800
Nothing else.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.240
Now that's a brave look.

14:06.240 --> 14:06.960
Tell me about that.

14:08.320 --> 14:11.440
What it says is that I graduated

14:11.440 --> 14:16.080
from the University of Buckin.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.360
Can I put-

14:17.360 --> 14:19.440
What about just robe?

14:19.440 --> 14:21.280
I got my magna cum loud.

14:21.280 --> 14:25.600
What about just robe cinched?

14:27.280 --> 14:29.120
Oh, rolled up sleeves to the shoulder.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.520
So you're showing the guns.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.160
I like to see some black jeans underneath the robe.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.520
That's a really cool look.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.040
If you get that look going.

14:37.040 --> 14:37.600
Hem it up.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.080
Hem it up.

14:38.080 --> 14:38.880
Cinch it with a belt.

14:38.880 --> 14:39.360
Hem it.

14:39.360 --> 14:40.160
Black jeans.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.240
No shirt.

14:42.240 --> 14:42.960
No shirt.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.280
You got a tunic, basically, or a blouse.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.440
Yeah, and have it open to the navel.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.520
Fraternity party.

14:50.480 --> 14:50.880
Yes.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.520
It depends on the theme, right?

14:53.520 --> 14:55.280
But if you do it, you have to wear it

14:55.280 --> 14:56.640
to every fraternity party

14:56.640 --> 14:59.360
so people start to know you as the robester.

14:59.360 --> 15:00.560
Oh, that's nice.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.280
Robes Pierre.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.200
Robes Pierre is here.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.680
Could you be Professor Beer Hands?

15:07.440 --> 15:09.120
Your hands would need to be made of beer.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.680
Have you guys ever heard of Edward Forty Hands?

15:12.480 --> 15:14.640
Yes, I've heard of Edward Forty Hands.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.040
Please, Professor Beer Hands is my father.

15:17.040 --> 15:17.840
Call me Edward.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.640
Professor Beer Hands was invented

15:20.640 --> 15:21.760
right after I got out of college,

15:21.760 --> 15:23.120
which is a shame because it seems like

15:23.120 --> 15:25.440
the kind of problem solving I could really get into.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.960
I have to tell you, it sounds like hipster legend.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.360
I don't believe anybody actually does Edward Forty Hands.

15:32.800 --> 15:33.040
I don't believe it happens.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.720
Can you imagine doing Edward Forty Hands

15:34.720 --> 15:36.480
and then like you get a phone call?

15:36.480 --> 15:36.880
Yeah.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.560
Or like there's a knock on the door.

15:38.560 --> 15:42.880
Or how about you've just consumed 80 ounces of liquid

15:42.880 --> 15:44.560
and you need to pass it through your body

15:44.560 --> 15:46.320
via penis or vagina.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.800
What's the next step there?

15:48.800 --> 15:50.720
Tell me where that terminates.

15:51.760 --> 15:54.320
You just start smacking at your zipper, I assume.

15:54.320 --> 15:54.720
Yeah.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.440
And hope that luck comes into play.

15:57.440 --> 15:57.600
Yeah.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.920
Dorm Formal, is that like a sex thing?

16:03.360 --> 16:06.880
First off, I hate to see a good portmanteau go by.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.720
I, it's your Dormal.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.640
I think that is what you should call it.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.280
Secondly, how, I mean, that's pretty formal.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.480
That's pretty, I mean, that's a formal look.

16:18.480 --> 16:22.000
It makes you look like an educated sorcerer.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.720
And I don't think there's anything more formal than that.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.320
Hem up the bottom of the robe about six inches, right?

16:28.320 --> 16:28.720
Okay.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.560
And then dress shoes, no socks.

16:31.760 --> 16:35.040
Army guys can wear their Army clothes,

16:35.040 --> 16:37.920
Army guy clothes to fancy occasions.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.440
And graduating from school is like

16:39.440 --> 16:43.360
graduating from the University of the Army.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.280
These are my brain fatigues.

16:45.280 --> 16:45.680
Thank you.

16:45.680 --> 16:49.120
Yeah, I did a tour of smart duty.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.360
And I think you should be able to like,

16:52.080 --> 16:54.080
let people know that you're, that you graduated.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.080
I think it sounds like what we're deciding is

16:58.080 --> 16:59.600
every occasion is a robe occasion.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.280
Yeah, we're batting a thousand right now.

17:01.280 --> 17:06.080
How about a job interview?

17:06.080 --> 17:06.400
Yes.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.800
If you're interviewing for a sorcerer, yes.

17:10.320 --> 17:13.760
I mean, again, it's a power play.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.240
Cause it's like, don't, you don't need to look at my diploma.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.400
You don't need to look at my resume.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.240
Look, look at this robe.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.000
Oh, and it's also an intimidation play.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.040
Cause if you think about it,

17:23.040 --> 17:24.480
all the other people in the waiting room

17:24.480 --> 17:26.480
about to go in for the interview, they look around.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.960
They're like, oh, that guy's way more educated than I am.

17:28.960 --> 17:32.800
Yeah, he's wearing his brain on his sleeve.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.160
Were we supposed to wear our robes?

17:34.160 --> 17:34.960
I had no idea.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.680
Can you, can you wear,

17:39.440 --> 17:42.880
can you wear over the robe a Boy Scout vest

17:42.880 --> 17:44.400
with all your badges on it?

17:44.400 --> 17:48.880
And maybe like, you know, a miss,

17:48.880 --> 17:50.560
whatever your state is, sash.

17:50.560 --> 17:54.320
Even if you're a man, I'm saying you should deck yourself

17:54.320 --> 17:59.120
with as many status claiming clothing items

17:59.120 --> 18:00.960
as you can possibly get your hands on.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.200
And like a bandolero with like all of your,

18:03.840 --> 18:06.960
all of your baseball trophies in it.

18:06.960 --> 18:10.640
Yeah, now you're gonna have to tell me what that is.

18:11.440 --> 18:14.320
You know, like a gun, like a bullet belt.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.320
That's called a bandolero, you say.

18:16.960 --> 18:17.920
I believe so.

18:17.920 --> 18:21.440
It's a bandolier, bandolarista.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.560
It's a borbillion.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.240
Borbillion.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.440
Should I bring my gold medals?

18:26.160 --> 18:27.840
Gold medals would be great, a tiara.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.960
Maybe those special contacts you got in high school

18:30.960 --> 18:33.440
that make your eyeballs look like money signs.

18:33.440 --> 18:36.000
That necklace that says I'm number one.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.000
Just let them know.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.040
Such a great investment.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.200
I didn't think it was gonna pay out.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.640
I didn't know if I was gonna get enough use

18:42.640 --> 18:43.920
out of my money sign contacts.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.680
But I really did.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.200
Because at first you got them for that gag

18:47.200 --> 18:48.800
when someone was like, we're gonna get paid.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.640
And you could go ka-ching, ka-ching.

18:50.640 --> 18:51.440
And look at them.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.000
But it has so many more uses.

18:54.000 --> 18:54.560
Not really.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.640
It has about as many uses as your graduation robe.

19:00.000 --> 19:07.360
Because I have mine from, I guess it's from Marshall.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.360
I just don't, I have it, it's in my closet.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.520
And I keep it and I don't know why.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.120
Because it's not very comfortable.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.080
Graduation robes have one use.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.160
You hang them on the back of your closet door

19:18.160 --> 19:19.760
and then you get really stoned

19:19.760 --> 19:22.400
and then you trick yourself into thinking Dracula's in your closet.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.520
Okay, that's it.

19:23.520 --> 19:24.320
That's a good one.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.240
Or if your plant is exploding,

19:26.240 --> 19:28.240
you can wrap your baby in one when you're shooting it.

19:30.240 --> 19:31.360
That's another thing.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.720
That's another thing to go for.

19:32.720 --> 19:33.920
But that's the only two things.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.360
Martha?

19:35.360 --> 19:37.280
Martha seems to be a baby in this crater

19:37.280 --> 19:40.320
and he seems to have graduated from the University of Oklahoma.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.600
Martha, maybe it's just me,

19:41.600 --> 19:44.320
but does this baby look fucking smart or what?

19:45.760 --> 19:46.260
Shit.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.560
He's gnawing on that cord.

19:48.560 --> 19:51.120
It must have essential nutrients in it.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.040
God, he's smart.

19:55.840 --> 19:56.880
Just throw them away.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.000
I want to see pictures.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.200
I want to see pictures of every listener of this show.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.920
And I want to see beers taped to your hands.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.760
I want to see putting a robe in the garbage.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.280
With your beer 40 hands,

20:09.280 --> 20:11.520
trying to maneuver into the garbage.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.280
That way they'll have one more use.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.960
They'll help you win our love.

20:15.760 --> 20:16.880
So there you got two uses out of it.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.840
And also to sop up all of the beer that you've spilled

20:19.840 --> 20:23.120
by trying to do something with beer hands.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.400
Hey brothers.

20:25.920 --> 20:26.880
I've got a problem.

20:26.880 --> 20:27.920
I want to be an actor

20:27.920 --> 20:30.640
and I know it's a very difficult route to take,

20:30.640 --> 20:33.520
but an opportunity has come up that's just too good to pass up.

20:33.520 --> 20:36.400
I recently started a day job though to make some money

20:36.400 --> 20:39.200
and my parents are very against me losing this day job,

20:39.200 --> 20:43.360
which I might have to lose to take the acting job.

20:43.360 --> 20:46.880
How I let them know my priorities differ from theirs on this one.

20:46.880 --> 20:47.680
That's from Sam.

20:48.800 --> 20:49.520
It's easy.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.880
You don't tell them.

20:50.880 --> 20:51.840
Yeah, they'll never know.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.520
Wait, what?

20:53.520 --> 20:53.840
What?

20:53.840 --> 20:55.840
I agree with you on that.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.880
There's a ton of stories of celebrities and comedians

20:58.880 --> 20:59.920
who tell the story of like,

20:59.920 --> 21:00.880
well, for a long time,

21:00.880 --> 21:03.600
my mom thought that I was still in law school

21:03.600 --> 21:07.200
or they had no idea that I was doing stand up comedy at night.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.320
Like, it's the thing to do, man.

21:10.320 --> 21:13.280
Like, don't tell them until you're successful

21:13.280 --> 21:15.760
or until you've got a solid contract and then say,

21:15.760 --> 21:17.280
oh, I'm making money doing that.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.120
Yeah, because that's what is the...

21:20.080 --> 21:21.120
See, you took that road.

21:21.120 --> 21:24.400
So what's the average?

21:24.400 --> 21:28.400
Like 99% of the time you end up on Saturday Night Live?

21:28.400 --> 21:28.880
Oh, yeah.

21:28.880 --> 21:29.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:29.760 --> 21:35.600
The problem is you would be able to answer this question really easily

21:35.600 --> 21:40.160
if you could see the perspective in which these events will be viewed.

21:40.160 --> 21:45.680
If you bet big and it turns out you're a success,

21:46.640 --> 21:47.680
none of this will matter.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.920
In fact, it will sweeten your story of success and sacrifice.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.480
If you don't make it,

21:56.400 --> 22:01.040
then this is just a depiction of how low you sank.

22:01.040 --> 22:03.360
Yeah, and you've got to remember that your parents

22:03.360 --> 22:05.120
are looking at this from the outside in.

22:05.680 --> 22:08.400
And so they're not looking at all of your potential

22:08.400 --> 22:10.320
and your confidence in this.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.720
They're looking at it from the perspective of people that love you

22:12.720 --> 22:15.200
and fear for your well-being.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.680
And they're going, that's a pretty big risk.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.440
Yeah, exactly.

22:19.440 --> 22:22.800
When they talk to Grandma Judy this year

22:22.800 --> 22:26.480
for their one time a year Grandma Judith check-in,

22:26.480 --> 22:28.320
this is the thing that they're going to talk about.

22:28.320 --> 22:28.960
This is it.

22:28.960 --> 22:32.400
Do you think Grandma Judith is like an actual biological grandmother

22:32.400 --> 22:34.480
or like an old friend of the family?

22:34.480 --> 22:37.360
I think she's just an old lady who walks around the neighborhood

22:37.360 --> 22:39.680
in her graduation robe from 1938.

22:41.040 --> 22:41.840
She seems wise.

22:42.480 --> 22:45.200
Check it, our son is so dumb.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.000
What's he doing?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.600
He had a great job at the Costco.

22:48.720 --> 22:52.080
I think if you want to broach this topic

22:52.080 --> 22:54.480
in a way that's going to be palatable to your parents,

22:54.480 --> 22:56.640
what you need to have is a...

22:57.680 --> 23:01.520
I'm sure that you are confident of your ability

23:01.520 --> 23:05.120
to continue to sustain yourself without the day job

23:05.120 --> 23:07.840
or else this wouldn't be a problem.

23:07.840 --> 23:10.480
You need to talk to your parents about how you're going to

23:11.760 --> 23:16.080
continue to be a sustainable person without the job.

23:16.080 --> 23:16.800
Because if you can do that,

23:16.800 --> 23:22.000
if you can convince them of why you'll be able to continue to take care of yourself,

23:22.000 --> 23:22.960
they won't care.

23:22.960 --> 23:27.600
It's not like they love the fact that you work at Einstein Brothers Bagel Bakery so much.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.400
They just want you.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.240
Maybe they do, maybe they get a discount on the bagels.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.600
Maybe they do get a discount on the bagels,

23:31.600 --> 23:32.640
in which case I can't help you.

23:32.640 --> 23:39.760
But all your parents want is to know that you're going to be safe and secure.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.520
So if you can convince them of that,

23:41.520 --> 23:44.560
they won't really give a crap if you want to have a day job.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.880
You might be able to explain it to them from the point of view of

23:46.880 --> 23:50.880
you get a day job to support yourself to do the thing that you want to do.

23:52.560 --> 23:56.080
So if you have to turn down acting jobs to keep your day job,

23:56.080 --> 23:58.560
it kind of defeats the purpose of having the day job.

23:58.560 --> 24:06.320
Um, I think you should sit your pants down and then, uh, like act, act in front of them.

24:06.880 --> 24:07.840
Oh.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.160
Just like do some acting in front of them.

24:11.520 --> 24:19.040
To like say, I like, I understand that you do not want me to leave my, uh,

24:19.040 --> 24:26.720
assistant manager position at, at the fashion bug, but, uh, would it, would it change things

24:26.720 --> 24:29.600
if I was Sir Lancelot?

24:32.880 --> 24:38.240
And then your parents are like visibly like their, uh, like their eyes go wide and they're

24:38.240 --> 24:40.960
like jaw slackens a bit and it's like, Oh my God.

24:40.960 --> 24:41.600
Oh my God.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.840
It's like Lancelot is here with me.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.000
It's just never, I've just never seen it in context.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.840
Did you hear what he did with his voice?

24:47.840 --> 24:48.960
Where did our son go?

24:50.240 --> 24:50.800
Fuck.

24:50.800 --> 24:56.160
Uh, I know you want me to keep working a day job, but how can I continue to work?

24:56.160 --> 25:00.800
Why should I continue to have a day job when I'm Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark?

25:02.080 --> 25:05.360
It doesn't make any sense for me to make bagels.

25:05.360 --> 25:08.080
Mama and Papa, I have a date.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.280
I am a Prince.

25:09.280 --> 25:10.800
I'm a Danish Prince.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.120
Bagels haven't been invented yet.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.800
This is a Danish voice.

25:19.120 --> 25:23.280
Who ever heard of Moliere working at McDonald's?

25:23.280 --> 25:24.560
Probably a lot of people.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.720
Oh yeah, probably would have.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.000
It probably definitely would have.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.600
Uh, I, I hope that helps.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.720
Or you know what?

25:32.720 --> 25:34.560
You want some advice from your old buddy, J-Man?

25:35.200 --> 25:36.640
Just keep the day job.

25:36.640 --> 25:37.920
Climb that ladder.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.520
No, don't listen to J-Man.

25:39.520 --> 25:42.240
J-Man, J-Man is wrong.

25:42.240 --> 25:46.800
J-Man wants everybody to just earn a living and build a society with me.

25:46.800 --> 25:47.520
How about that?

25:47.520 --> 25:50.240
How about everybody, everybody, here's my dream.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.800
We're all in a society together and we all have jobs.

25:52.800 --> 25:53.520
How's that?

25:53.520 --> 25:54.240
How's that?

25:54.240 --> 25:56.080
We all pay in our own way.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.680
You should quit your day job.

25:57.680 --> 25:58.880
You should pick up a newspaper.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.560
There's jobs everywhere.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.080
People are crazy with jobs.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.440
There's job fever.

26:03.440 --> 26:07.520
They can't find enough people to fill all these great, great jobs they have.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.840
So by all means, quit your day job.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.520
I'm sure you'll find another one.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.760
You're going to be, you're going to be 23 forever.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.160
Don't listen to your parents.

26:16.880 --> 26:18.080
You'll be 23 forever.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.320
Oh man.

26:20.320 --> 26:20.820
Fuck.

26:21.680 --> 26:22.180
Come on.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.860
Come on, build this with me.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.180
I know it's not fun being a cog.

26:26.180 --> 26:26.680
Come on.

26:28.580 --> 26:29.540
Come on.

26:29.540 --> 26:34.020
You gotta be a cog to support, you know, the bigger cogs that are on top of you, crushing you.

26:34.020 --> 26:40.100
All that we're saying is that my toilet is broke and it is fucking wicked expensive to fix it.

26:40.100 --> 26:47.220
Supply and demand, more toilet engineers equals cheaper toilet maintenance for myself and my man.

26:47.220 --> 26:49.860
Nobody, competition brings down rates.

26:49.860 --> 26:50.260
Yeah.

26:50.260 --> 26:55.300
I had a discussion last night with a, with a young man who was carving a pig.

26:55.300 --> 27:01.620
The pig's name was Brian and the, and the, this young man carving, carving it out of what?

27:01.620 --> 27:02.900
What was the man's name?

27:03.780 --> 27:04.740
I do, I did.

27:04.740 --> 27:06.580
I swear to God, I did not learn that man's name.

27:06.580 --> 27:07.300
The pig's name was Brian.

27:07.300 --> 27:07.800
Christ.

27:08.900 --> 27:11.460
Did he take his name tag off and put it on the pig as a goof?

27:11.460 --> 27:11.940
Possibly.

27:11.940 --> 27:13.780
Was the pig talkative?

27:13.780 --> 27:15.620
No, the pig was dead.

27:15.620 --> 27:23.060
Oh, what? And he told me that I said, where is the best, most delicious meat on Brian?

27:23.060 --> 27:26.500
And he said, Brian's most delicious feature are his cheeks.

27:27.060 --> 27:30.980
People, but they don't sell pig cheeks because that doesn't make any sense.

27:30.980 --> 27:33.060
You, you know, you get one pig, two cheeks.

27:33.060 --> 27:34.180
You can't really box that.

27:35.700 --> 27:37.780
The economics of that don't scale.

27:37.780 --> 27:42.660
And I said, well, why don't you shave me off one of Brian's cheeks and I'll just eat it now before

27:42.660 --> 27:46.500
Brian Grimm gets to tuck into this piggy pig pig.

27:46.500 --> 27:49.860
Cause they won't, they won't, they won't know that the cheeks are the best.

27:49.860 --> 27:53.540
They'll mix the cheek meat in with the rump and then it'll eat it and be like,

27:53.540 --> 27:54.500
oh, that was good rump.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.820
And you're like, you dumb assholes.

27:56.820 --> 27:59.060
You just wasted two sweet cheeks on rump.

27:59.860 --> 28:04.420
So I walked away eating a cheek and thinking

28:06.660 --> 28:12.100
how nice it was to have a conversation with a person that knows anything.

28:12.100 --> 28:14.740
That you didn't bother to learn his name.

28:14.740 --> 28:15.940
He seemed nice.

28:15.940 --> 28:20.020
I, I did not pick up his name, but it was so nice to talk to someone

28:20.020 --> 28:23.780
who actually knew about anything in this digital era.

28:23.780 --> 28:26.740
Pretty much nobody knows anything.

28:26.740 --> 28:27.140
Yeah.

28:27.140 --> 28:29.940
It is so refreshing to talk to someone who has a skill,

28:31.300 --> 28:34.740
some sort of skill that actually has some value.

28:34.740 --> 28:37.620
Especially not like acting, which is bullshit.

28:38.420 --> 28:38.740
Right.

28:38.740 --> 28:40.500
Like learn a trade skill.

28:40.500 --> 28:44.820
Those people are the real artists yourself to somebody like a metallurgist.

28:45.700 --> 28:46.180
Don't do that.

28:46.180 --> 28:47.220
I read Johnny Tremaine.

28:47.220 --> 28:48.260
I know how that shakes out.

28:48.260 --> 28:52.020
Don't do that, but please just learn a skill.

28:53.620 --> 28:55.300
Get in the machine with me, please.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.580
Let's just get this chest.

28:56.580 --> 28:58.820
Let's get this old fucking, this old.

28:59.380 --> 29:01.700
I still think that maybe I'm alone.

29:01.700 --> 29:05.540
I still think there's some kick and some get up and go left in this beautiful,

29:05.540 --> 29:07.780
old machine named America.

29:07.780 --> 29:08.100
Yeah.

29:08.100 --> 29:09.780
So why don't you get in here with me?

29:09.780 --> 29:11.860
Let's rev this engine, kick the tires,

29:11.860 --> 29:15.540
and see if we can't still put some miles between us and the Ruskies.

29:15.540 --> 29:15.860
You know?

29:15.860 --> 29:19.220
Because actors are like the fuzzy dice of America.

29:19.220 --> 29:19.540
Yeah.

29:19.540 --> 29:19.940
Right?

29:19.940 --> 29:20.500
I love this.

29:20.500 --> 29:20.820
Yeah.

29:20.820 --> 29:21.860
I love this.

29:21.860 --> 29:24.740
Please keep chasing this metaphor.

29:24.740 --> 29:26.660
I'm just saying actors are the fuzzy dice.

29:26.660 --> 29:30.980
And like the assistant manager at Einstein's Bagel is like the gasoline.

29:30.980 --> 29:33.380
You're the gasoline that keeps it going.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.620
I think you know about things like bagels.

29:35.620 --> 29:40.340
The produce guy at IGA is like the side view mirrors, right?

29:40.900 --> 29:41.940
Basically, yes.

29:41.940 --> 29:42.740
Take your shot.

29:42.740 --> 29:46.020
And the door handles are the guy who works at the secondhand music store.

29:46.020 --> 29:46.740
Okay.

29:46.740 --> 29:48.500
Take your shot at acting.

29:48.500 --> 29:49.380
Here's your course.

29:49.380 --> 29:50.820
Take your shot at acting.

29:50.820 --> 29:54.500
And even if you miss, you won't land in the stars.

29:55.140 --> 29:56.740
You will land back at home unemployed.

29:56.740 --> 30:01.860
But then what you do, fire up the TiVo, load up an episode of Dirty Jobs,

30:01.860 --> 30:08.020
and just throw a dart at the TV and then your TV's going to break the screen.

30:08.020 --> 30:10.420
And then decide that you're going to be a TV repairman.

30:10.420 --> 30:11.220
Precisely.

30:11.220 --> 30:13.300
Real quick before your parents get home.

30:13.300 --> 30:14.260
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.420
Phoenix Online, help me.

30:19.220 --> 30:21.220
I need a two and a half hour degree.

30:21.220 --> 30:21.460
Fuck.

30:24.180 --> 30:25.700
Only I learned a skill.

30:25.700 --> 30:26.580
I'm so busted.

30:27.220 --> 30:29.540
Guys, this week on IFC, it's Comedy Bang Bang.

30:29.540 --> 30:32.820
It's an absurd half hour comedy show that only looks like a talk show.

30:32.820 --> 30:36.740
It's comedy so nice they banged it twice with your host Scott Ackerman,

30:36.740 --> 30:39.380
band led by Reggie Watts, and amazing guests.

30:40.340 --> 30:42.980
People like Amy Poehler, Zach Galifianakis, and Seth Rogen.

30:42.980 --> 30:47.860
This week it's Ed Helms who shows off his banjo and animal noise making skills.

30:47.860 --> 30:48.740
That's this Friday.

30:48.740 --> 30:49.460
Check it out.

30:49.460 --> 30:50.900
Hey, I want to tell you about Squarespace.

30:50.900 --> 30:54.580
It's where you can go to create your own website or blog in just minutes.

30:54.580 --> 30:55.860
It's easy to use.

30:55.860 --> 31:00.820
They've got these beautiful templates and there's a support team there 24 seven online workshops.

31:00.820 --> 31:03.860
Again, someone with a skill making the machine run.

31:03.860 --> 31:06.980
They got free domains when you sign up for one year.

31:06.980 --> 31:13.700
So go to squarespace.com and our listeners will get 10% off by using offer code my brother seven.

31:13.700 --> 31:18.100
That's my space brother space seven, the number seven.

31:18.100 --> 31:22.820
So use that code and go build something for yourself.

31:22.820 --> 31:23.780
How about a Yahoo answer?

31:23.780 --> 31:25.780
Yeah, I'm ready.

31:25.780 --> 31:26.660
Oh, shit.

31:26.660 --> 31:28.260
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

31:28.260 --> 31:28.740
Thank you, Lisa.

31:28.740 --> 31:34.420
It's by Yahoo Answers user Minty Fresh who asks, what are some good dance crew names?

31:35.700 --> 31:39.220
I'm putting together a dance crew and previously our name would have been Snick Snacks

31:39.860 --> 31:40.820
with Xs.

31:40.820 --> 31:44.820
There were some issues with using that name as we wanted male dancers too,

31:44.820 --> 31:46.740
but the name was appealing to them.

31:46.740 --> 31:50.500
So the members that I have now wish to change it to a badass name.

31:50.500 --> 31:51.620
Does anyone have any ideas?

31:51.620 --> 31:53.780
We might use the name and we might change some things in it

31:53.780 --> 31:55.220
to make it more suitable for the look of the group.

31:55.220 --> 31:56.180
Thank you, smiley face.

31:57.940 --> 31:59.620
First of all, I want to address that.

31:59.620 --> 32:04.900
What is there inherently about Snick Snacks that implies anything one way or the other?

32:06.420 --> 32:14.260
I think Snick Snacks would be a good name for like a plump centric dancing crew.

32:14.260 --> 32:15.460
Those have to exist, right?

32:17.540 --> 32:18.100
You would think?

32:18.100 --> 32:20.980
Like a dancing crew that is mostly comprised.

32:23.460 --> 32:25.780
I'm just saying that heavy people like snacks, I guess.

32:26.900 --> 32:30.500
Basically, in short, heavy people like snacks.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.980
Can I revise the goof?

32:33.700 --> 32:35.380
Can we looper it, please?

32:36.100 --> 32:36.660
Allowed.

32:37.860 --> 32:41.700
What if it is just composed of Clarissa from Clarissa Explains It All

32:41.700 --> 32:44.500
and Keenan and also Cal and the All That crew?

32:44.980 --> 32:45.460
Oh, I see.

32:45.460 --> 32:46.500
Hey, do you guys remember Snick?

32:46.500 --> 32:47.300
Do you guys remember Snick?

32:48.820 --> 32:49.300
Okay, wait.

32:49.300 --> 32:49.860
Hold on.

32:49.860 --> 32:52.500
Let's operate on the preface that you remember Snick.

32:52.500 --> 32:53.460
I'm going to looper it again.

32:53.460 --> 32:53.860
Back up.

32:53.860 --> 32:54.980
Hey, do you guys remember Snick?

32:55.700 --> 32:58.420
It was this great programming block on the Nickelodeon channel.

32:58.420 --> 32:59.540
Came on Saturday nights.

32:59.540 --> 33:16.340
It stood for Saturday nights in kids, Saturday night, Nick, it's Snick, Saturday night, Nick, Snick, Snick.

33:16.340 --> 33:19.860
Are you sure this wasn't a factor?

33:19.860 --> 33:24.500
I am 150,000% sure.

33:24.500 --> 33:28.420
It's been 20 seconds and I can't think of another word that starts with C.

33:28.420 --> 33:29.140
TV.

33:29.140 --> 33:31.700
TV used to be so much more edgy.

33:32.900 --> 33:34.740
You want some All That, you little cunt?

33:36.020 --> 33:42.980
Anyway, so this joke, it involves characters from the Snick lineup.

33:42.980 --> 33:43.300
Fuck it.

33:43.300 --> 33:43.780
Oh, I see.

33:43.780 --> 33:44.580
Let's just go.

33:44.580 --> 33:45.540
Let's just go.

33:45.540 --> 33:47.780
I'm trying to think of some kind of badass name

33:47.780 --> 33:50.660
that contains the word Steppen with an apostrophe.

33:50.660 --> 33:51.460
Steppenwolves?

33:53.540 --> 33:54.580
I think that's taken.

33:54.580 --> 33:55.460
Yeah, I guess.

33:55.460 --> 33:56.420
Not the plural, though.

33:56.420 --> 34:05.060
So, Travis, I've created a game to help us answer this question and get our brains working.

34:05.060 --> 34:07.700
I'm going to ask you, give you a series of different names.

34:08.260 --> 34:10.340
For each name, I need you to tell me if it's

34:12.580 --> 34:17.140
one of the teams that competed on America's Best Dance Crew or one of the Snorks.

34:17.140 --> 34:25.140
Now, I feel like I need to sit this out because I've actually watched a couple of seasons of that

34:25.140 --> 34:27.860
and I know how crazy town this shit can get.

34:27.860 --> 34:29.060
I've never watched it.

34:29.060 --> 34:29.780
Let's do this.

34:29.780 --> 34:31.860
All right, Travis, are you ready?

34:31.860 --> 34:32.180
Yes.

34:33.700 --> 34:34.500
Small Star.

34:35.860 --> 34:36.340
Snork.

34:36.980 --> 34:37.380
Correct.

34:37.380 --> 34:39.380
It's a yellow-skinned female infant Snork.

34:40.180 --> 34:41.060
Blueprint Crew.

34:42.660 --> 34:43.780
Dance Team.

34:43.780 --> 34:44.180
Correct.

34:45.140 --> 34:46.020
Hype 5-0.

34:49.300 --> 34:50.100
Is it a Snork?

34:50.900 --> 34:51.700
Incorrect.

34:51.700 --> 34:52.740
That's a Dance Crew.

34:52.740 --> 34:54.180
Vogue Evolution.

34:54.180 --> 34:54.900
That's a Dance Team.

34:54.900 --> 34:55.400
Stop.

34:56.100 --> 34:56.660
Okay.

34:56.660 --> 35:00.420
You expected there to be much more across the arena.

35:00.420 --> 35:01.620
I thought there would be much more.

35:01.620 --> 35:02.420
Anti-Marina.

35:04.180 --> 35:06.580
Oh, I'm going to go with Snork?

35:06.580 --> 35:07.140
Correct.

35:07.140 --> 35:09.940
Static Noise in a Y-Z-E.

35:13.460 --> 35:14.900
That's definitely a Snork.

35:14.900 --> 35:15.700
That is correct.

35:15.700 --> 35:16.580
I'm going to tell you a name.

35:16.580 --> 35:17.380
That is indeed a Snork.

35:17.380 --> 35:22.340
I'm going to tell you a name and I want you to tell me if it's a full name.

35:22.340 --> 35:27.300
A former U.S. president or a member of the Parliament Funkadelic.

35:27.300 --> 35:27.620
Begin.

35:29.460 --> 35:38.100
I'm going to say a word and I want you to tell me if it is a fruit or not a fruit.

35:38.100 --> 35:38.900
Here we go.

35:38.900 --> 35:39.460
Asphalt.

35:40.260 --> 35:41.780
Travis, let me hit you with this.

35:41.780 --> 35:43.540
Iconic Boys with a Z.

35:46.980 --> 35:48.260
Is that a Dance Team?

35:48.260 --> 35:48.740
Correct.

35:48.740 --> 35:49.860
Eclectic Gentlemen.

35:49.860 --> 35:51.780
I want it to be a Snork.

35:51.780 --> 35:52.180
I know.

35:52.180 --> 35:53.460
I want it to be a Snork, too.

35:54.980 --> 35:55.540
Is it?

35:55.540 --> 35:58.180
Enigma Dance Crew K.R.U.

36:01.220 --> 36:03.940
I mean, obviously that's a Dance Crew.

36:03.940 --> 36:06.980
I'm just trying to decide if that's the full name of it.

36:06.980 --> 36:08.580
Dance Crew K.R.U.

36:10.660 --> 36:13.060
I can't help you any more than I already have, Travis.

36:13.060 --> 36:14.260
I'm so sorry.

36:14.260 --> 36:15.540
I'm going to go with Snork.

36:15.540 --> 36:17.140
Just trust my gut on this one.

36:17.140 --> 36:20.740
What a big shame is, Travis, what about Jabberwocky?

36:21.940 --> 36:24.820
I know that that's a Dance Team because they do the scary neutral masks.

36:24.820 --> 36:30.020
See, if they didn't have that, if they didn't have that fame, that is the only possible

36:30.020 --> 36:31.780
Snork crossover I could think of.

36:33.300 --> 36:35.460
Okay, Travis, one more for you.

36:35.460 --> 36:38.100
Gary Diperman Shider.

36:38.100 --> 36:40.580
Dance Crew.

36:40.580 --> 36:46.900
Unfortunately, Gary Diperman Shider was a member of the Parliament Funkadelic.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.580
The Parliament Funkadelic.

36:48.580 --> 36:51.700
So that was cheating on that front.

36:51.700 --> 36:54.660
Travis, grapes, go, begin.

36:54.660 --> 36:55.860
Fruit, it's a fruit.

36:56.740 --> 37:01.940
Yahoo Answers user Izzy dropped some suggests in the Yahoo Answers.

37:02.740 --> 37:07.700
Izzy suggested Maniacs, Bar-

37:07.700 --> 37:08.260
With an X?

37:10.660 --> 37:11.940
No, unfortunately.

37:11.940 --> 37:16.900
Bar-Bara-Ains with a Z and also misspelled.

37:16.900 --> 37:19.140
Possibly Bar-Bara Brains, which is cool.

37:20.580 --> 37:21.460
Bar-Bara Brains.

37:22.260 --> 37:26.100
Fusion, Inbeat Aerodynamics with a Z.

37:27.780 --> 37:32.260
There's also Ferocity 911, which I actually do like that a lot.

37:33.060 --> 37:33.940
Hannah Bar-Bara.

37:34.980 --> 37:35.940
Snork.

37:35.940 --> 37:36.820
Hannah Barbarian.

37:37.460 --> 37:38.660
Man, hey.

37:38.660 --> 37:39.940
Hey Roller Diver girls.

37:39.940 --> 37:44.420
Hannah Barbarian would be a pretty good name.

37:46.100 --> 37:47.540
What about Snorks with an X?

37:48.100 --> 37:48.420
I feel like-

37:48.420 --> 37:50.020
Oh my god, that would be a good Dance Crew.

37:50.820 --> 37:56.500
And then you could just come up with other variations on like little star,

37:56.500 --> 38:04.660
but you work the word like high jump into that because that's like an integral move.

38:05.540 --> 38:08.420
You guys would not believe some of the things the Snorks are doing with bubbles.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.940
That's crazy.

38:09.940 --> 38:12.020
They climb into a bubble at one point.

38:12.020 --> 38:12.820
They're in a bubble.

38:14.660 --> 38:19.140
Do you guys ever think about what it would be like to be a part of a Dance Crew?

38:19.140 --> 38:22.340
I can't imagine any other like union,

38:22.340 --> 38:25.780
like any level of unity that I could feel with a person more than-

38:25.780 --> 38:26.260
I feel like-

38:26.260 --> 38:27.220
More than a Dance Crew?

38:27.220 --> 38:27.380
Yeah.

38:28.020 --> 38:34.820
I feel like my problem would be that I would constantly get momentary groove impulses

38:34.820 --> 38:38.340
and my body would tell me to follow a groove and it would mess up my-

38:38.340 --> 38:39.700
You're a loose cannon, McElroy.

38:39.700 --> 38:40.260
Yeah, exactly.

38:40.260 --> 38:42.260
You've got no place on the Snorks revolution.

38:42.260 --> 38:45.460
I need your dance badge on my desk by three o'clock.

38:47.220 --> 38:51.380
You would be the turbo of the community.

38:51.860 --> 38:56.420
I can't go back to the dance mayor one more time and explain to him why you-

38:56.420 --> 38:58.900
The dance commissioner's on my ass, McElroy.

38:58.900 --> 39:03.460
I'm getting too old for this shit, literally, because my old bones won't do the flips.

39:03.460 --> 39:08.900
I'm tired of answering for your groove shenanigans, groove nanigans.

39:09.540 --> 39:13.700
Maybe you should try putting moves together instead of busting them constantly.

39:15.700 --> 39:20.100
You cost $20 of damage to the dance floor yesterday with your groove.

39:20.580 --> 39:22.500
You set it on fire, literally.

39:23.700 --> 39:29.700
Now I got a- Now the chief of dance commissioning is on my case, on my back.

39:29.700 --> 39:33.780
You're a showboat, McElroy, and you got us fired from working at the showboat.

39:33.780 --> 39:36.580
This is your new partner, a drum machine. Let's kick it.

39:38.180 --> 39:39.860
He's an actual dance robot.

39:39.860 --> 39:41.940
He's a dance robot. You're being replaced.

39:42.820 --> 39:44.980
This is your new partner, Skrillex.

39:46.020 --> 39:47.860
And this is Blade Runner, the dance movie.

39:47.860 --> 39:51.300
Two weeks later, you'll never believe it, the dance robot is turned.

39:51.300 --> 39:52.260
We need you back.

39:53.460 --> 39:54.740
There's one man for this job.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.260
No, I swore.

39:56.260 --> 39:58.020
I swore I would never dance again.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.860
I swore I would never dance again.

40:00.420 --> 40:01.700
No, Paul, don't do it.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.540
You said we're gonna build a life together.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.940
You said you would never dance again.

40:05.940 --> 40:07.380
Don't you understand, Tammy?

40:07.940 --> 40:12.660
If I don't go back and defeat that dance robot in a dance battle, who will?

40:12.660 --> 40:14.900
Get ready to smell the funk.

40:16.100 --> 40:18.820
I will kill you like I did your partner.

40:18.820 --> 40:20.740
I have captured the dance mayor.

40:23.060 --> 40:24.980
I'm going to dance your daughter to death.

40:24.980 --> 40:26.900
No!

40:26.900 --> 40:29.380
No human is brave enough to dance against me.

40:29.940 --> 40:30.420
Oh yeah?

40:30.980 --> 40:35.940
Me and inspiration with three z's have something to say about that.

40:36.660 --> 40:37.460
Let's go, team.

40:37.460 --> 40:38.260
I'm back.

40:38.260 --> 40:40.020
You get him, Dance Carl!

40:40.020 --> 40:42.260
Get him? Really, Travis?

40:42.260 --> 40:43.620
What? What's wrong with Dance Carl?

40:43.620 --> 40:47.140
I'm literally googling Dance Cruise right now to find a name to say.

40:52.420 --> 40:53.380
Oh, fuck.

40:53.380 --> 40:55.220
It's Dance Carl with an X.

40:55.220 --> 40:56.420
Oh, shit.

40:56.420 --> 40:57.460
That is pretty edgy.

41:00.180 --> 41:01.380
Hey, I got a question here.

41:02.340 --> 41:07.060
I don't know if I often go to movies because I find the unpleasantness surrounding the screen

41:07.060 --> 41:10.980
outweighs the thrill of seeing what is essentially a really big TV.

41:10.980 --> 41:14.900
In the case of a person making an unreasonable amount of noise, what is the proper etiquette?

41:14.900 --> 41:18.500
The scold in me wants to shush them like an 80-year-old librarian,

41:18.500 --> 41:21.620
but I don't want to be an even bigger asshole than the noisemaker.

41:21.620 --> 41:22.660
What would you do?

41:22.660 --> 41:24.500
That's from Incensed in Indiana.

41:25.220 --> 41:28.820
If I've learned anything from Dad, the proper response is you turn around,

41:28.820 --> 41:32.660
and you make your eyes really big and angry, and you kind of purse your lips together,

41:32.660 --> 41:35.380
and you just stare at them really hard for like 30 seconds,

41:35.940 --> 41:38.740
and then you turn back around without actually doing anything.

41:38.740 --> 41:43.540
I think that's move one, and then move two is you say to them,

41:43.540 --> 41:44.580
hey, can you keep it down?

41:44.580 --> 41:45.940
We're trying to watch a movie.

41:45.940 --> 41:50.340
If that's not enough, if that doesn't work, then I say go to The Usher.

41:50.340 --> 41:55.780
Or nobody wants to be a killjoy like that, but I think that's the only option left.

41:55.780 --> 41:58.660
I think you guys are escalating it a little bit too slow.

41:58.660 --> 42:00.660
I think you gotta shock and awe.

42:01.460 --> 42:03.300
Just like turn around, no warning.

42:03.300 --> 42:04.580
Just yell like, shut it!

42:05.140 --> 42:06.660
Like that in that voice.

42:06.660 --> 42:07.220
Oh boy.

42:07.220 --> 42:08.900
Making direct eye contact with them.

42:09.540 --> 42:12.580
Do you think dump a buck of popcorn on their heads?

42:12.580 --> 42:16.180
I think dunk a buppet of lava.

42:16.180 --> 42:18.580
Just dunk one buppet.

42:18.580 --> 42:20.980
Just dump a buppet of lava on their face.

42:20.980 --> 42:21.700
Dump a buppet.

42:21.700 --> 42:23.460
Get a buppet, fill it with lava.

42:24.420 --> 42:30.020
Do I get a discount for buying one carjun of soda and a buppet of popcorn

42:30.020 --> 42:32.980
if I buy both the carjun and the buppet together?

42:32.980 --> 42:35.220
Can I get just like a Borks of Junior Mets?

42:35.220 --> 42:42.740
Let me just get some Bummy, get some Bummywerps and a buppet of sweet, sweet nuttered cop corn.

42:42.740 --> 42:46.980
Can I get one of those hot purzels with a little bit of that Cho's all over it?

42:46.980 --> 42:47.460
Thanks.

42:47.460 --> 42:49.460
Do you have the Nietzsche Cho's?

42:50.340 --> 42:53.860
I prefer sort of a mooxican flaver to that.

42:53.860 --> 42:55.540
You got them hot dogs?

42:55.540 --> 42:56.820
I love my hot dogs.

42:57.940 --> 42:59.540
I have all the aphasias.

43:02.580 --> 43:06.820
But you're right Griffin in that you really shouldn't ever have to ask.

43:06.820 --> 43:08.980
We should all know how to behave.

43:08.980 --> 43:14.580
We should all know how to behave, it's not like they have encroached unknowingly

43:15.220 --> 43:17.460
on your auditory personal space.

43:17.460 --> 43:20.340
There's no way that you miss that lesson growing up,

43:20.340 --> 43:23.380
hey don't like talk when people are watching movies.

43:23.380 --> 43:24.980
Right, I mean it's 101.

43:24.980 --> 43:29.380
Can you just quietly lift your middle finger in the air and leave it there for the remainder of the film?

43:30.180 --> 43:31.540
Like without turning around?

43:31.540 --> 43:34.740
Don't turn around, yeah yeah, because you're watching the fucking movie.

43:34.740 --> 43:37.220
Don't let them distract from two of your senses.

43:37.220 --> 43:39.380
Just stick your middle finger in the air and let them know,

43:39.380 --> 43:40.500
because what are they going to do then?

43:41.860 --> 43:42.900
What are they going to do then?

43:42.900 --> 43:43.700
What's their, what's their?

43:43.700 --> 43:47.780
Oh and like maybe you've drawn a little man on your finger shushing them.

43:47.780 --> 43:51.860
I don't, I think that, I think that after five seconds he's like,

43:51.860 --> 43:54.500
hey whatever man, and then after like five minutes he's like,

43:55.140 --> 43:59.140
okay man, and then like an hour into it he's like,

43:59.140 --> 44:01.540
I don't know, do I go talk to, what do I do?

44:02.580 --> 44:04.180
He seems angry still.

44:04.180 --> 44:05.220
You know what I hate?

44:05.220 --> 44:08.820
I hate when I'm at a movie theater and I just want to stand up and enjoy myself.

44:09.460 --> 44:13.540
There's always one guy, there's one guy behind me who's like,

44:13.540 --> 44:16.260
the groove is overtaking me, I just want to dance in the aisles.

44:16.260 --> 44:19.620
Yeah, I just want to stand up and just enjoy the movie.

44:19.620 --> 44:20.020
There's always some jerk.

44:20.020 --> 44:22.660
I just want Harry Connick to know that I'm really enjoying the show.

44:22.660 --> 44:23.780
Yeah, yeah.

44:23.780 --> 44:24.660
Even when he's not there.

44:25.540 --> 44:27.860
If I want to masturbate during the Katy Perry film.

44:29.940 --> 44:30.900
You should be able to.

44:30.900 --> 44:31.860
I, I guess.

44:31.860 --> 44:34.020
Oh, there's a hilarious, if you guys get a chance,

44:34.020 --> 44:38.100
check it out on YouTube, it was on the Max Fun homepage, so go check it out.

44:39.060 --> 44:44.100
Jordan Morris wrote a parody video of an advertisement for Katy Perry for dads.

44:44.100 --> 44:47.060
Yeah, and Jesse Thorne, yeah, narrated it.

44:47.060 --> 44:48.180
It's good stuff.

44:48.180 --> 44:49.380
It's on Funny or Die, I believe.

44:50.900 --> 44:54.500
Hey, serious answer to that question, just moved to Austin.

44:54.500 --> 44:56.660
Our theaters, if you talk here, they shoot you.

44:57.300 --> 45:00.900
Yeah, dude, we went to the Alamo Drafthouse, it was amazing.

45:00.900 --> 45:03.700
Yeah, yeah, everybody just so, it's so scared.

45:03.700 --> 45:05.700
I've never been so terrified watching a film before.

45:05.700 --> 45:08.260
They play scary music and they put up words on the screen

45:08.260 --> 45:09.940
that say they'll fucking kill you.

45:09.940 --> 45:12.500
They'll fucking kill you, I saw it once.

45:12.500 --> 45:17.140
I thought the scene, the scene they show from Schindler's List was a little unnecessary,

45:17.140 --> 45:19.220
but I certainly think it gets the point across.

45:19.220 --> 45:21.380
Yeah, I saw them kill a kid.

45:22.580 --> 45:24.580
Yeah, that was pretty hard.

45:24.580 --> 45:25.140
They fucking killed.

45:25.140 --> 45:27.540
It was like that scene from Reservoir Dogs.

45:27.540 --> 45:31.060
Here's the worst part, it was during a Dora the Explorer short at the beginning,

45:31.060 --> 45:32.980
and she was asking for feedback.

45:32.980 --> 45:33.220
Yeah.

45:33.220 --> 45:36.740
I mean, she was begging them to say, where is, where is Steeler?

45:36.740 --> 45:37.940
Yeah, what is this?

45:37.940 --> 45:38.740
It's a backpack.

45:38.740 --> 45:39.620
Oh, fuck.

45:40.980 --> 45:42.660
Sorry, Swiper.

45:42.660 --> 45:43.780
Fuck, fuck.

45:43.780 --> 45:44.260
Hey.

45:44.260 --> 45:44.900
Hey.

45:44.900 --> 45:45.220
Hey.

45:45.220 --> 45:45.700
Fuck.

45:45.700 --> 45:46.100
Hey.

45:46.100 --> 45:46.420
Guys.

45:47.140 --> 45:50.340
Guys, if we can't at least be factually correct about Dora the Explorer,

45:50.340 --> 45:51.780
then what the fuck are we doing here?

45:52.820 --> 45:56.420
If you wanna keep us from swiping things, then you're gonna need to follow us.

45:56.420 --> 46:21.620
Who's this message from?

46:21.620 --> 46:23.220
It's for Jasmine.

46:23.220 --> 46:24.340
Who's this message from?

46:24.980 --> 46:26.180
It's for Matt.

46:26.180 --> 46:27.620
Happy birthday, Jasmine.

46:27.620 --> 46:29.140
I got you this Jumbotron,

46:29.140 --> 46:31.860
because I know how much you love those McElroy brothers.

46:31.860 --> 46:33.620
Almost as much as you love cooking bacon,

46:33.620 --> 46:35.620
candy, delicious things, beating me at Magic the Gathering,

46:35.620 --> 46:38.020
playing Guild Wars, and watching documentaries about bears.

46:38.020 --> 46:40.420
That's the best life ever.

46:40.420 --> 46:41.540
That's such a good life.

46:41.540 --> 46:42.580
You've done it.

46:42.580 --> 46:44.980
I think you're the coolest and love you like crazy.

46:44.980 --> 46:46.020
That's from Matt.

46:46.020 --> 46:48.180
He put it with three T's both times.

46:48.180 --> 46:50.980
So I'm thinking that is how he actually spells it.

46:50.980 --> 46:56.260
Do you think maybe it's pronounced like Matatata?

46:56.260 --> 46:57.540
His name is a drum roll.

46:57.540 --> 46:59.220
Matata was my favorite Pokemon.

47:00.420 --> 47:02.180
Matt, Matt.

47:02.900 --> 47:03.460
Hey, Matt.

47:06.260 --> 47:06.580
Matt.

47:07.300 --> 47:07.540
Yes.

47:10.820 --> 47:11.540
You rang.

47:11.540 --> 47:12.340
You rang, yes.

47:13.060 --> 47:13.780
Can I help you?

47:14.980 --> 47:16.180
This message is for Jillian.

47:16.180 --> 47:18.180
It's from Seth, who says,

47:18.180 --> 47:22.020
congrats on getting through your surgery, you got through the tough part, now just take it easy.

47:22.660 --> 47:25.460
It might be hard right now, but if it wasn't hard, everyone would do it.

47:25.460 --> 47:27.380
The hard is what makes you great.

47:27.380 --> 47:29.220
Just keep calm and stay strong.

47:29.220 --> 47:29.780
Best foot.

47:31.140 --> 47:31.940
Isn't that sweet?

47:32.500 --> 47:33.700
Proud of you, Jill Jill.

47:33.700 --> 47:37.700
We get a lot of, we get a lot of goofies in here,

47:37.700 --> 47:41.060
but sometimes something real sweet and genuine happens.

47:41.060 --> 47:43.060
And I think that that was one of those moments.

47:43.060 --> 47:48.660
And I think the more we talk about it, I think it magnifies it somehow.

47:48.660 --> 47:49.460
Beautiful.

47:49.460 --> 47:51.940
The more we inspect it, the more beautiful it becomes.

47:51.940 --> 47:56.820
It's almost as if we are more responsible for it than they are

47:57.620 --> 48:01.460
because we have dwelt on it for so long, don't you think?

48:01.460 --> 48:04.260
Yeah, it's like we made it happen retroactively.

48:05.460 --> 48:11.060
Hey, I want you guys to check out a new San Francisco based lifestyle podcast with a humorous

48:11.060 --> 48:13.300
bent. It's called the Philosopher Kings.

48:13.300 --> 48:16.740
They discuss topics like the fashion sense of Captain Ron,

48:17.380 --> 48:21.460
which Eiffel 65 song is topping the charts in Germany,

48:21.460 --> 48:25.220
the ultimate cocktail to accompany your next screening of Point Break.

48:25.220 --> 48:27.620
There are special guests like a Google employee,

48:27.620 --> 48:31.140
acclaimed drag queen slash filmmaker Peaches Christ,

48:31.140 --> 48:34.020
and our lesbian roommate, Lauren the Ape.

48:36.020 --> 48:38.820
So, I have nine questions in this show.

48:38.820 --> 48:43.860
Yeah, I have 50 questions. I need another podcast about how to understand the ad for

48:43.860 --> 48:47.540
the Philosopher Kings Guide to the Good Life. That's in iTunes.

48:48.420 --> 48:51.220
Search for Philosopher Kings and subscribe right now.

48:51.220 --> 48:53.780
And honestly, if that description isn't enough to make you do it,

48:53.780 --> 48:58.580
I don't know what you're waiting for because that's a lot of enigmas there.

48:59.220 --> 49:01.060
I'm going to be a bridesmaid for a wedding this fall.

49:02.100 --> 49:04.660
The bachelorette party is scheduled in about a month,

49:04.660 --> 49:09.060
and I've just received word from the maid of honor that it's going to be fairly classic,

49:09.060 --> 49:11.380
or cliché, depending on your viewpoint.

49:11.380 --> 49:16.260
She has scheduled an afternoon at the spa, followed by dinner, drinks, and dancing downtown.

49:17.300 --> 49:20.260
We are expected to perform the evening's festivities decked out in...

49:22.660 --> 49:23.380
I was waiting.

49:25.620 --> 49:27.380
In penis jewelry.

49:27.380 --> 49:28.820
Is that jewelry for your penis?

49:28.820 --> 49:33.380
That is not jewelry for your penis. It is jewelry depicting

49:33.380 --> 49:35.700
the image of a penis.

49:35.700 --> 49:36.820
The knight is going to culminate-

49:36.820 --> 49:38.420
Like a die-cast medal of penis.

49:38.420 --> 49:38.980
Exactly.

49:40.580 --> 49:44.660
His knight is going to culminate with a visit from a male stripper to our hotel room.

49:44.660 --> 49:45.940
Hey, I've got one of those.

49:49.220 --> 49:50.980
I see y'all are big fans.

49:50.980 --> 49:58.340
I see you're fans of dicks. Well, get ready. I have one to enjoy. Please to enjoy.

49:58.340 --> 50:04.260
My dick's got a smaller ring with a dick on it. Check this out.

50:05.380 --> 50:08.980
Somebody get a microscope and see the dick that's on Hit's dick.

50:10.980 --> 50:16.820
Do you have any tips for how I can get through this shindig with some dignity intact?

50:16.820 --> 50:21.540
Some dignity intact. That's from Petrified in Pittsburgh.

50:21.540 --> 50:26.420
Yeah, I got a quick solution for you. Don't go. That sounds like the pits.

50:26.420 --> 50:31.460
This is one of those things where it's not like you're missing something

50:31.460 --> 50:34.580
and there's some trick to coming through it with your dignity.

50:35.380 --> 50:39.380
It's designed to be embarrassing and wild and crazy and silly.

50:39.380 --> 50:42.260
But it's not, though. Is there some point-

50:42.260 --> 50:44.980
And I'm legitimately torn on this question because

50:45.700 --> 50:48.580
we can all take a vote and agree that's terrible.

50:48.580 --> 50:52.260
Yeah. And let's make it clear, regardless of gender,

50:53.140 --> 50:55.700
if the genders were swapped, still fucking awful.

50:55.700 --> 50:59.300
That's the pits. If I have an evening as a gentleman

50:59.300 --> 51:01.380
where one guy is going to look at me and be like,

51:01.380 --> 51:03.700
this is just like in Swingers. I'm out.

51:03.700 --> 51:04.660
Oh no. Fuck that dude.

51:04.660 --> 51:06.580
I'm 100% out.

51:06.580 --> 51:09.060
And I love Swingers at night.

51:09.060 --> 51:09.620
You're ruining my point.

51:09.620 --> 51:12.180
Don't get me wrong. Anyone who says that makes me want to kill them.

51:12.180 --> 51:17.380
The problem- Okay, so there's one perspective that I can definitely see this from

51:17.380 --> 51:18.980
where it's like, you're a fuddy duddy.

51:19.780 --> 51:23.380
I know it sucks, but just go along with it because this is what you do.

51:23.380 --> 51:26.340
But isn't that like while we're still doing funerals?

51:26.340 --> 51:30.580
Because no one says, hey, this blows. Can we not anymore?

51:31.300 --> 51:33.140
I don't want to be rude, but- Isn't there a possibility, though,

51:33.140 --> 51:36.340
that this is what the bride really wanted for her thing?

51:36.340 --> 51:37.300
Because she's nasty.

51:39.380 --> 51:41.780
She wants to get rowdy and nasty.

51:42.580 --> 51:45.860
I mean, is it possible that this is her dream bachelorette party?

51:45.860 --> 51:49.140
That's- I mean, that's probable.

51:50.740 --> 51:52.100
I mean, you have to suppose that.

51:52.100 --> 51:58.820
And it's like, this is the last legit non-jewelry penis

51:58.820 --> 52:01.620
that this woman's going to see other than her sweet betrothes.

52:02.980 --> 52:04.820
I could see- maybe, I guess.

52:05.700 --> 52:09.300
I can't divorce myself from the fact- I could never be in that situation,

52:09.300 --> 52:12.100
and I have not been in that situation, but I could never be in it

52:12.900 --> 52:14.580
and be like, this is a professional.

52:15.220 --> 52:17.460
It's cool because we're giving them money.

52:17.460 --> 52:22.180
It would still be like, here's a naked person in a place where they're the only one.

52:22.180 --> 52:23.540
So, neat.

52:26.260 --> 52:27.300
How enjoyable.

52:27.300 --> 52:29.380
Hey, that's neat, I guess.

52:29.380 --> 52:30.340
Having a great time.

52:30.340 --> 52:31.540
Good. You know what you should do?

52:31.540 --> 52:32.740
You should go full blown.

52:32.740 --> 52:35.940
You should just furiously masturbate and just be like, what?

52:35.940 --> 52:36.740
I'm enjoying it.

52:36.740 --> 52:38.180
Isn't this what you wanted?

52:38.180 --> 52:39.700
This is a typical response, right?

52:40.340 --> 52:40.820
What?

52:40.820 --> 52:42.180
Should I not be twibbing it right now?

52:42.180 --> 52:43.300
Yeah, expose-

52:43.300 --> 52:44.420
You planned it, Debbie.

52:44.420 --> 52:44.980
You deal with it.

52:44.980 --> 52:45.540
Expose-

52:45.540 --> 52:47.460
Planned it.

52:47.460 --> 52:49.380
Expose the norm.

52:49.380 --> 52:50.180
That's what I'm saying.

52:51.300 --> 52:54.180
If I find I'm going to be in an uncomfortable scenario,

52:54.820 --> 53:00.260
sometimes one of the tricks I do is I try to learn more about the scenario than anybody there.

53:00.260 --> 53:06.740
So, I can try to make myself the most- like, get super deep into etiquette for male strippers.

53:06.740 --> 53:09.620
Like, what is off limits?

53:09.620 --> 53:10.180
What is good?

53:10.180 --> 53:10.580
What is not?

53:10.580 --> 53:11.780
Oh, no, no, no.

53:11.780 --> 53:14.260
Okay, Susan, you'd have a dollar for each ball.

53:14.260 --> 53:16.100
It's a dollar per ball, Susan.

53:16.100 --> 53:20.260
Oh, you looked right into his spread, but you can't-

53:20.260 --> 53:25.300
Is that a move that male strippers do?

53:25.300 --> 53:28.020
He parted them for you, you know that.

53:28.020 --> 53:29.700
He parted them, it's five dollars.

53:29.700 --> 53:31.060
I know what you're going to love.

53:31.860 --> 53:39.380
You know the part of the show where he spreads his butt cheeks and stands motionless for 15 minutes?

53:39.380 --> 53:44.820
And you throw Skittles.

53:44.820 --> 53:46.020
It's like a carnival game.

53:46.020 --> 53:50.580
You're not actually supposed to look for more than 20 seconds at a time.

53:51.860 --> 53:53.460
Or else it loses its specialness.

53:54.500 --> 53:56.020
Actually, no one's supposed to look.

53:56.020 --> 53:57.700
If you look, he leaves.

53:57.700 --> 53:58.980
He scambres off.

53:58.980 --> 54:00.420
He just starts-

54:00.420 --> 54:02.180
Oh, you spooked him, Sheila.

54:02.180 --> 54:02.660
Damn it.

54:02.660 --> 54:02.980
No.

54:02.980 --> 54:09.220
He starts anytime someone looks inside his spread bow, he starts the timer over again.

54:09.220 --> 54:12.260
People die of hydration this way.

54:16.260 --> 54:17.700
Hey, somebody look.

54:17.700 --> 54:19.380
God damn it, Christy.

54:19.380 --> 54:21.300
God damn it, I gotta start again.

54:21.300 --> 54:23.060
One, two.

54:23.060 --> 54:24.740
No one look at my spread butthole.

54:27.060 --> 54:27.380
Please.

54:27.380 --> 54:28.980
Isn't that the plot of Magic Mike?

54:28.980 --> 54:36.660
It's basically the first hour and 45 minutes are him trying to get through the 15 minutes.

54:36.660 --> 54:38.100
No, it's an interactive film.

54:39.780 --> 54:41.780
It is just Stockard Channing-

54:41.780 --> 54:43.060
But it's on the honor system.

54:43.060 --> 54:45.780
You have to push the button connected to your seat if you-

54:45.780 --> 54:49.060
It is just Stockard Channing's spread butthole on the screen.

54:49.860 --> 54:50.820
Yes, mom and dad.

54:50.820 --> 54:55.300
I do want to pursue acting and I'm sorry, but I'm quitting my day job as the usher that

54:55.300 --> 55:00.260
has demanded the audience to make sure no one looks at Channing Tatum's spread butthole.

55:00.260 --> 55:02.100
I said Stockard Channing!

55:02.100 --> 55:04.100
You said Stockard Channing!

55:04.100 --> 55:06.260
Stockard Channing doesn't hurt me!

55:06.260 --> 55:09.140
You said Stockard Channing's spread butthole!

55:10.980 --> 55:14.420
You conjured that image into existence with your words!

55:14.420 --> 55:15.060
Throw up!

55:17.700 --> 55:21.540
Now everyone is thinking about Stockard Channing's spread butthole.

55:21.540 --> 55:23.380
It's your fucking fault!

55:23.380 --> 55:28.020
You know, you actually said it and I went through this montage similar to like Showgirls

55:28.020 --> 55:33.300
where Stockard Channing is like training Channing Tatum.

55:33.300 --> 55:38.420
No, you gotta spread it like this to really get the soldier's vitriol up.

55:39.460 --> 55:41.540
Your humors are all out of whack, Channo.

55:41.540 --> 55:43.140
Take it from me.

55:45.780 --> 55:49.380
You know that's not the first time that switch has happened.

55:49.380 --> 55:50.420
Oh, Christ.

55:50.420 --> 55:52.740
This has been our comedy advice show.

55:52.740 --> 55:56.420
My brother, my brother and me, thank you so much for listening to it.

55:57.460 --> 56:00.660
Griffin has a formal apology he'd like to issue.

56:01.140 --> 56:02.420
I'm sorry, Ms. Channing.

56:02.420 --> 56:06.100
You were the president's wife and I did you wrong.

56:07.060 --> 56:08.580
Yeah, you did it real wrong.

56:09.540 --> 56:11.540
Thank you for everybody tweeting about the show.

56:11.540 --> 56:18.260
Jay Christie, Billiard123, Socketeer, Scrattybones, Luke Docker, Slaskimo,

56:18.260 --> 56:23.460
Pit Danger, Tracy Wilson, Ivy Warner, everybody.

56:24.500 --> 56:32.020
Thank you for tweeting with the MBMBAM hashtag and helping us to spread the word about the show.

56:32.020 --> 56:37.140
If you tweet about it, you want to help expose more people, that's the best way we have it growing.

56:37.140 --> 56:40.020
Just send it to bit.ly forward slash It's My Vim Bam.

56:40.020 --> 56:44.820
That's our sampler and then get a get a taste of the show and see if they like it.

56:44.820 --> 56:48.820
And I want to say a special thanks to Lori and Jonah.

56:48.820 --> 56:53.780
They came and saw the complete works of William Shakespeare with me in it and brought me

56:53.780 --> 56:58.020
a shit you're not the most amazing cupcakes I have ever tasted in my entire life.

56:58.020 --> 56:58.500
That's sweet.

56:58.500 --> 56:59.460
Thank you guys so much.

56:59.460 --> 57:03.860
And Lori was sweet enough to make me swear that I would share them with the stage manager

57:03.860 --> 57:07.140
because her brother was a stage manager and nobody ever brought him anything that was

57:07.140 --> 57:08.580
brought the actor stuff.

57:08.580 --> 57:10.420
I know it was like the sweetest thing.

57:10.420 --> 57:11.780
So thank you guys so much.

57:11.780 --> 57:12.580
Thank you for coming.

57:12.580 --> 57:13.380
Thank you for watching.

57:13.380 --> 57:15.060
Thank you guys so much. Thank you for coming.

57:15.060 --> 57:16.420
Thank you for the cupcakes.

57:16.420 --> 57:19.060
Now you definitely didn't share those with the stage manager, right?

57:19.060 --> 57:22.420
No, I shoveled them straight into your throat.

57:22.420 --> 57:25.300
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

57:25.300 --> 57:26.980
It's a departure off the album.

57:26.980 --> 57:28.740
Putting the days to bed.

57:28.740 --> 57:30.100
Go buy it.

57:30.100 --> 57:31.140
I can't stress this enough.

57:31.140 --> 57:32.180
Don't Spotify it.

57:32.180 --> 57:34.420
Don't because I'll know.

57:34.420 --> 57:39.460
Also, if you haven't, go give a listen to the other maximum fun shows.

57:39.460 --> 57:43.380
Jordan and Jesse Go, Stop Podcasting Yourself, Throwing Shade.

57:43.380 --> 57:46.340
And our new little brother, Memory Palace.

57:46.340 --> 57:47.540
There's some good stuff in there.

57:47.540 --> 57:51.620
It's a bit of a tonal shift, I would say.

57:52.260 --> 57:56.180
They're not going to talk about Stock and Channing Spread's wide butthole.

57:56.180 --> 57:59.300
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't listen to it.

57:59.300 --> 58:02.180
In fact, it probably means you shouldn't listen to this anymore.

58:03.780 --> 58:04.660
Ironically, no.

58:05.860 --> 58:07.300
So go check out the Memory Palace.

58:07.300 --> 58:08.420
Yeah, it's on iTunes.

58:08.420 --> 58:09.060
You search for it.

58:09.060 --> 58:09.700
You listen to it.

58:09.700 --> 58:10.500
You subscribe.

58:10.500 --> 58:11.780
And subscribe and review our show.

58:11.780 --> 58:14.100
As long as you've got the program booted up.

58:14.100 --> 58:17.860
As long as you're already winning your C prompt and loaded iTunes.

58:17.860 --> 58:19.140
Go ahead and throw us a review.

58:19.700 --> 58:21.540
This final Yahoo was sent in by Jake Carter.

58:21.540 --> 58:22.100
Thanks, Jake.

58:22.100 --> 58:24.420
It's by Yahoo Answers user Cory, who asks,

58:26.020 --> 58:29.620
can a kid with a very mild concussion go to Dave and Buster's?

58:32.180 --> 58:33.300
I'm Justin McElroy.

58:33.300 --> 58:34.020
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:34.020 --> 58:34.900
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:35.620 --> 58:37.060
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

58:37.060 --> 58:37.860
Kiss your dad.

58:37.860 --> 58:39.300
This boy on the lips.
