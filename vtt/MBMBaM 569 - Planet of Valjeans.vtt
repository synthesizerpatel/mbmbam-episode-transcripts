WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better it's better

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:10.660 --> 01:15.980
Hello everybody welcome to my brother my brother me and advice show for

01:15.980 --> 01:17.980
the future era

01:19.200 --> 01:26.320
What an honor and a thrill it is to be presenting this show. I'm the oldest brother of the program. My name is Justin

01:27.020 --> 01:29.020
McElroy, my name is

01:29.900 --> 01:36.280
Travis McElroy. I am your middle-est big dog wolf wolf brother out here. It is absolutely beautiful

01:36.280 --> 01:45.840
Hey there, come on back now. This is your baby brother Griffin McElroy space cowboy. Yeah

01:46.520 --> 01:51.780
We are doing the first this is the first my brother and brother and me from our

01:53.780 --> 01:55.780
Limited

01:56.400 --> 02:01.280
Interstellar tourism business that we just started space boys with a Z and

02:01.280 --> 02:06.280
We're not where you think by the way, the Z is where the C should be

02:07.660 --> 02:09.660
space boys boys

02:10.840 --> 02:13.440
Now there's just one s it's space

02:14.040 --> 02:17.800
Boys boys. Yeah. Yeah, so we're up here

02:17.800 --> 02:25.100
Hey, listen pretend I didn't start it the usual way because if you guys space for the first time you just say some like cool

02:25.100 --> 02:27.100
Shit, so can I can we all take it?

02:27.100 --> 02:33.820
Let's let me adjust that let me adjust our audio calibrator. Yeah, we can get that smoothed out. Okay. Is that any better?

02:36.340 --> 02:43.060
So I was well, you know like that's one small step for man one giant leap for me that whole thing

02:43.060 --> 02:46.100
It doesn't make any sense by that doesn't make any sense. Don't get it

02:46.100 --> 02:51.660
What if we are I was wondering if for this inaugural launch we're up here in this beautiful

02:52.800 --> 02:54.800
You know obsidian

02:54.800 --> 03:01.000
Sky we call space. Yeah, right a big sky above the sky. We call space the sky

03:01.760 --> 03:04.400
Sky, yeah skies dad. Yeah

03:05.700 --> 03:10.060
No, this is skies dad skies dad space the dad of the skies. Uh-huh

03:10.060 --> 03:15.020
I was wondering if we could all take it take a chance and take a turn at like

03:15.940 --> 03:23.020
Dropping our like space. Oh, like what's the thing? They're gonna like put on our like tombstone. What's the thing?

03:23.020 --> 03:27.960
It's not our tombstone. I wasn't going in that direction at all more thinking like when people watch video of this

03:28.140 --> 03:31.100
You got a pole one clip if you're making the movie

03:31.180 --> 03:35.820
Where the aliens are looking at all the cool shit a humanity did and decide not to wipe us out

03:35.820 --> 03:38.460
You know what? I mean? Yeah, it's like a Nelson Mandela quote

03:38.860 --> 03:43.540
There's probably Malala and then there's us listen. I'm a space thing

03:43.540 --> 03:45.700
I don't know if Neil Armstrong is dead or not

03:45.700 --> 03:49.060
But you don't think they'll put like one small step on his tombstone

03:49.060 --> 03:54.720
We have to go we have to one up that is what we're saying. Yeah, we're gonna be better. Okay, I got one

03:54.720 --> 03:59.060
I got one. I got one. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's 2012. Okay, some peace deal Armstrong

03:59.060 --> 04:03.960
I'm gonna make stuff for sure. That's two small steps for man

04:04.620 --> 04:06.940
two giant leaves for mankind

04:08.420 --> 04:11.280
Okay, you doubled it essentially

04:11.280 --> 04:19.080
Because yeah, no, it's awesome. I mean you could say any number there you could have been like that's like a hundred steps

04:19.320 --> 04:26.280
Yeah, and then like way bigger big jumps and then we hopped in like a cool space car and drove for a while

04:27.200 --> 04:29.200
Okay, how about this one?

04:29.700 --> 04:36.620
When you not it does push you back. Yeah, we can confirm that that is built on both of these are

04:36.620 --> 04:45.040
Lacking sort of a ring of like timelessness because they are based on references to things of so far

04:45.840 --> 04:53.320
Decreasing relevance. Okay. Can I try one? Yeah, please and mine's more of just sort of like an acknowledgment of like our space accomplishments

04:53.320 --> 04:55.320
so I was thinking like I

04:56.800 --> 05:01.060
Am the first man to have eaten an entire watermelon

05:01.060 --> 05:09.020
Watermelon aboard my rocket ship, but it made a big mess and they made me come land it back on earth early

05:10.100 --> 05:15.140
Say it again. So this is the thing you have to be it has to have a ring of timeless

05:15.140 --> 05:18.420
I'm the first man to have ever eaten a whole

05:19.140 --> 05:24.820
Watermelon up in a space rocket ship, but ding damn it made a big fricking fucking mess

05:24.820 --> 05:29.660
And they made me land it early cuz all the juice and seats that got everywhere in the apartment

05:29.660 --> 05:34.300
Justin that's a good point because the one in the main problem if I could get some notes on

05:34.900 --> 05:40.560
Step for man a lot of words a lot of what if we just shorten it to space?

05:40.740 --> 05:45.340
It's fucking cool out here. Well, now what if we shortened?

05:45.940 --> 05:52.520
What if we shorten one small set that a whole bit? Okay, like what we need is it's you know Twitter

05:52.520 --> 05:59.560
Didn't even have time for the eat. You know, we have to shorten this how what would you guys think about this like big steppin?

06:01.280 --> 06:08.320
Just like that's you get the idea big steppin up here in space step for me. No a jump

06:09.080 --> 06:14.720
Boom be good. That's good. See my short arm punch here. Oh watermelon mess coming home

06:14.720 --> 06:22.160
I see that is yeah, that's not bad. What I'll tell you what's even easier to remember Houston

06:22.160 --> 06:28.960
We have a problem. Yeah, right very short very memorable. Maybe it's like oopsie. I ate some melon

06:29.560 --> 06:35.680
Do you think do you think that when Tom Hanks when he when that really happened the real Tom Hanks?

06:35.680 --> 06:40.560
Yeah, when they did Apollo 13, do you think when he was like you soon?

06:40.560 --> 06:47.600
We have a problem. Do you think a brain Houston's like looks at each other like I know I know we're all worried about this

06:48.400 --> 06:50.400
But that was like pretty cool

06:53.840 --> 07:00.480
I love him and I'm we're gonna get these these fighting boys home safely. No problemo, but wasn't it cool

07:00.760 --> 07:06.560
Can we take like five seconds? Hey Johnson write that down Houston right? We have a problem. Oh, wait, sorry

07:06.560 --> 07:12.800
Hey, Tom Hanks was there a comma in that between Houston and we or was it a period do you think just if you had to?

07:12.800 --> 07:16.840
Specify hey, we're just trying to get what's that? You can't breathe. Right, right, right, right

07:16.840 --> 07:20.460
You need to find an egg crate or something. I don't remember that movie

07:20.460 --> 07:26.260
I was just looking at Richard Branson's Wikipedia Sir Richard Branson's Wikipedia page and in his like

07:26.920 --> 07:30.680
His I guess resume that they have here they have listed, you know

07:30.680 --> 07:38.200
He has five billion dollars and did he's a knight and apparently a virgin but anyway, it says

07:39.280 --> 07:46.160
Space career virgin galactic commercial astronaut time in space one minute 12 seconds

07:46.360 --> 07:53.000
That's a cool career sir. Richard Brandt the trajectory of your shit was awesome, man. Awesome, man. Good job

07:53.000 --> 07:58.540
You did it rich. I'm an astronaut for a minute for 72 seconds dick

07:58.540 --> 08:00.460
Branson

08:00.460 --> 08:03.460
I'm an astronaut like all the big boys

08:06.140 --> 08:09.500
You're a one-minute astronaut partner, hey

08:10.060 --> 08:15.020
Sir, Richard Branson, could you possibly pay off? I don't know like a thousand people's hospital bills

08:15.020 --> 08:18.900
No, I'm going to space for 72 seconds

08:18.900 --> 08:23.540
and by and by a thousand people's hospital bills Travis means all

08:23.540 --> 08:29.920
Hospital bills ever for everyone on the earth who has ever gotten sick or hurt

08:30.480 --> 08:34.960
But it's space, but it's 72 seconds. I could be closer to the moon

08:35.560 --> 08:41.800
You can't even eat a little bit. You can't even pierce the hide of a watermelon

08:42.760 --> 08:46.540
Using the tools available to you on a spaceship in 70

08:47.360 --> 08:50.200
They don't they don't let you bring a knife to space

08:50.200 --> 08:55.960
They simply don't tune in to this season of taskmaster featuring five

08:56.200 --> 09:03.360
Rich assholes and we say hey, you have 72 seconds of space. How much watermelon can you eat over and over?

09:03.360 --> 09:09.760
That's the only challenge. We just repeat it over and over real quick. I do have this is connected

09:10.540 --> 09:16.160
Virgin Galactic we're gonna be following this story pretty closely because it's just well, they're competing with us, you know

09:16.160 --> 09:21.160
What there's only enough room in space, you know, yeah for space boys and the virgin galactic

09:21.160 --> 09:26.840
I want to bring this breaking news story from Ashton Kutcher if I can stand by

09:29.560 --> 09:35.680
When I got married to have kids my wife basically encouraged that it was not a

09:36.760 --> 09:38.560
smart family decision

09:38.560 --> 09:40.600
To be heading into space when we have young children

09:40.600 --> 09:46.080
and so I ended up selling my ticket back to Virgin Galactic

09:47.280 --> 09:49.640
And I was supposed to be on the next flight

09:50.280 --> 09:52.280
But I will not be on the next flight

09:53.080 --> 09:55.080
But at some point I'm going to space

09:55.840 --> 09:58.400
So, okay. Here's the story. Here's the scoop

09:59.240 --> 10:02.600
Okay, wait, I got live here. You guys were listening there

10:03.040 --> 10:07.000
Obviously a plus K was gonna go to space and that is what I said

10:07.000 --> 10:11.640
He was a lot of good space and now he's pretty dejected about that as you could imagine

10:11.640 --> 10:14.320
He really wanted to go to space. It looks so cool up there

10:14.440 --> 10:20.440
But but Kelso from that Sony show will not be in space everyone right now

10:21.160 --> 10:23.160
like Kelso

10:24.800 --> 10:27.120
Does ticketmaster have a

10:28.040 --> 10:31.040
refund option for space I

10:31.040 --> 10:37.160
Mean Virgin Galactic is is wanting like some other luminary can get yeah

10:37.360 --> 10:42.240
He put it up on stub hub Griffin. So like it's a resale thing now at this

10:42.240 --> 10:48.320
So a plus K is a space ticket scalper. Yeah, what you're saying. I'm kind of right. All right

10:50.800 --> 10:52.800
Yeah, another question

10:53.400 --> 11:00.080
They're gonna go to space again. Yeah, you learn their lesson the first time for 73 seconds this time. Yeah, they're gonna go big again

11:00.080 --> 11:05.920
There's gonna be a conversation where Richard Branson's like employees are like

11:06.600 --> 11:12.400
So do you want to go to space again? And he's gonna have to be like, nah, I think I got it

11:16.160 --> 11:19.160
Like you just go up there and yeah, I get it

11:19.160 --> 11:22.200
I thought you're gonna say the opposite Justin which is like, yeah

11:22.200 --> 11:28.120
I can't wait to go to space again and they're like, well Richard you've already been shouldn't someone else get to go and he's like

11:28.120 --> 11:30.120
What but?

11:31.680 --> 11:36.640
It's my rock in it, but I've got more money than anyone I

11:37.280 --> 11:42.060
Think I left my keys up there at Richard Branson. Is that true? I'm not

11:43.320 --> 11:47.920
Where Richard Branson is from maybe it's space. Maybe he's just trying to get home

11:48.360 --> 11:55.320
Are you sure you left your keys up there Richard Branson? Well, you haven't seen me drive recently. Have you? Well, no, that's true

11:55.320 --> 11:59.520
Richard Branson. Oh, yeah, I left me car up there too. What?

12:00.040 --> 12:05.580
Yeah, like, you know, Elon put his car on the rocket there. I did that

12:06.400 --> 12:10.840
Bye. Ah, his rocket took off. He's gone. Damn it. He distracted us

12:11.880 --> 12:19.040
Well space boys, I can't wait for our next big we should say our rocket our whole program was entirely free

12:19.040 --> 12:23.040
We we built it out of stuff. We found a dad's garage free and guess what?

12:23.040 --> 12:26.240
Guess how many times this exploded none times none

12:26.800 --> 12:30.960
Every time I turn on the news, it's like you want to blow it up another one up for the ocean

12:30.960 --> 12:33.800
And I'm like you fucking dummy. It's not that hard

12:34.400 --> 12:39.440
Not space boys. We got 100% success rate. Yes, it's definitely found in our daddy's garage

12:40.240 --> 12:43.720
Can we land real quick? Yeah. Okay, bring her in. Oh

12:44.680 --> 12:49.200
That's smooth. Yeah, it's real good juice. Thank you. Yeah, no big deal

12:50.280 --> 12:52.120
No big deal

12:52.120 --> 12:57.400
So this is an advice show also, which it seems weird. It seems kind of antiquated at this point

12:57.400 --> 12:58.560
Well, we can't keep getting the money

12:58.560 --> 13:04.880
They're not gonna let us keep going to space and abandoning the many many solvable problems of Earth unless we keep getting the money

13:04.880 --> 13:11.920
So right. I'm not ready to give up on fixing all of Earth's problems. I just also want to fix the moon's problems

13:12.600 --> 13:17.120
So good to you. Thank you. I'm a big man with a big heart and a big hunger

13:17.600 --> 13:21.840
Not anymore cuz you know the watermelon. I'm saying I was the one who ate that you guys

13:21.840 --> 13:24.800
You know, hold on. This is revisionist history you too

13:24.800 --> 13:27.920
And I don't want to tear space boys apart right when it starts

13:27.920 --> 13:33.720
But the two of you if we could actually play the tape back because you know, they're recording that shit non-stop

13:35.320 --> 13:39.760
Because the surveillance state in space it it was a lot like hmm

13:40.200 --> 13:44.880
That's the sound of me pulling the watermelon on my bag and then you two were like Griffin. What the fuck?

13:44.880 --> 13:50.640
We told you not to bring that and I was like, come on. Come on. Come on guys. It's my birthday

13:50.640 --> 13:55.680
It's like Griffin. We had weighed everything very specifically like yeah

13:55.680 --> 14:00.540
Yeah, and we did not account for one whole watermelon and then it was a lot of

14:01.960 --> 14:07.180
And then Justin was like Griffin your teeth aren't strong enough to gnaw through the outside and I was like, well

14:07.180 --> 14:11.040
They don't let you bring a knife to space and then Travis like Griffin

14:11.040 --> 14:16.080
What are you doing Griffin stop stop stop because you saw me lift it up over my head and smash it on the ground and then

14:16.080 --> 14:17.440
Start just sort of scooping it

14:17.440 --> 14:21.920
Well, you know catching it out of the air with a small net that I did manage to bring on board

14:22.120 --> 14:26.880
But there was a lot of you two can't claim credit for eating the watermelon. You're right. You're right

14:26.880 --> 14:30.000
It was just you and can I move on please? That'd be all right. Yeah. Thank you

14:31.360 --> 14:35.980
I'm staying at my family friend's house for a bit while I start a new job

14:35.980 --> 14:41.080
I brought some avocado with me for a healthy lunch. Cool. The problem cool

14:41.080 --> 14:47.000
I promise my avocados aren't ripe yet. My friends have an avocado that is ripe, but they're out of town right now

14:47.080 --> 14:52.960
So should I just eat their avocado replace it with one of my avocados without asking would it be even weirder if I asked?

14:55.160 --> 15:00.360
Would they notice that's from potential avocado bandit in SC South Carolina

15:01.240 --> 15:07.520
Anybody who would notice that is not is no friend of yours

15:07.520 --> 15:10.180
anyone who has is

15:10.820 --> 15:15.900
Keeping such close tabs on their avocado that they can tell when it's a bit

15:16.300 --> 15:23.420
Indiana Jones switched out with another avocado is not someone anyone should be associating with not only that

15:23.420 --> 15:26.420
but when my avocados go right the chance that

15:26.860 --> 15:31.780
The Venn diagram overlaps of like they're ready to eat and I'm ready to eat them

15:31.780 --> 15:39.620
It's not always perfect. And so the idea of someone be like, hey you weren't home when your avocado was ripe

15:39.740 --> 15:41.900
So I bought you some time

15:42.700 --> 15:49.380
By consuming that already ready avocado and giving you like that's that you've done them a favor

15:50.140 --> 15:52.320
Yeah, you know, I said what I said

15:52.320 --> 15:58.700
But it was wrong because Travis brings up a good point if they if they have been sitting on these these emerald beauties

15:58.700 --> 16:00.940
until they stop being

16:01.660 --> 16:05.780
Hard and disgusting but before they get soft and brown and gross

16:06.180 --> 16:09.720
But then you switch it out with one that is not in that sweet window

16:09.940 --> 16:14.540
They I would actually the the game would be afoot at that point

16:14.540 --> 16:17.660
I think it just it depends on how long they're gonna be gone

16:18.300 --> 16:20.300
You know if they're back the next day

16:20.500 --> 16:24.720
No, but if they're gone for a couple days that window short, you know

16:24.720 --> 16:29.340
I think it's a great business to cut like right

16:29.340 --> 16:32.940
okay, so I placed a grocery store order and the grocery store just like

16:33.860 --> 16:37.540
Brought a bunch of avocados for free. Well, yeah

16:38.380 --> 16:43.060
Sample and it says in the bag like sample over hot bonus boys. We know about

16:44.300 --> 16:50.180
Before you need to stop accidentally spreading these kinds of feelings about West Virginia because that makes it sound like

16:50.180 --> 16:55.260
Like the grocery stores in West Virginia like how do we get people to buy these avocados?

16:55.260 --> 17:00.660
They're so scared of them. We must give them samples. It's part. Well, it is kind of a weird like I

17:01.580 --> 17:06.060
Don't feel I feel like even if the anyway avocados should have been my house

17:06.060 --> 17:12.760
Okay, a bunch of free avocados except I had not structured any sort of avocado dish

17:13.260 --> 17:15.260
Avocado opportunity. Yeah, you know

17:15.260 --> 17:20.140
Yeah, yeah in my head. So there's just they're just sitting on the counter and getting riper and riper

17:20.300 --> 17:25.380
And I don't have a plan for it and don't tweet at me. No, I know I can make ice cream

17:28.220 --> 17:34.660
I know about this. I know about avocado toast not allowed to eat it cuz I'm 40, but I'm gonna know about it

17:34.980 --> 17:39.020
Don't know what to do with these bad boys. They're just sitting there. I would love a service

17:39.540 --> 17:44.260
Where someone's like comes to your house you like do you produce you feel guilty about I'm like, yeah

17:44.260 --> 17:50.900
Actually, this asparagus looks like thick spaghetti because it's caused a limp and bad and and I would you eat it?

17:50.900 --> 17:52.900
And they're like, yeah, absolutely. No problem

17:53.300 --> 17:59.060
So no guilt for you for the for the stuff where you're making your grocery order and you're like, I'm an adult

17:59.060 --> 18:01.860
I should buy vegetables and yeah, you get some zucchini

18:02.100 --> 18:06.060
Yeah, right zucchini comes and you put it in the crisper drawer where things go to die

18:06.380 --> 18:10.580
Yeah, then it's like two weeks later. Like oh, yeah, I need to do something with that zucchini

18:10.580 --> 18:14.060
Yeah, I'm gonna do it that's a key. I like I like the scam

18:14.500 --> 18:19.340
Where you put a bunch of fresh produce in there and then you start to feel guilty about it

18:19.340 --> 18:24.740
And then you're like wait, I left an onion in here a month ago. This rotten onion has ruined everything

18:25.380 --> 18:32.100
Just start again. No more guilt for me. One thing is sticky in here. You all got here, man

18:32.100 --> 18:38.540
Every crisper drawers the fucking gross, you know, I ever get in there and it's like time to clean this fucking stinky box out

18:38.540 --> 18:45.420
The worst is when you when you pull the drawer out and underneath there's just this reddish brown film. Yes

18:47.100 --> 18:51.140
What is it nothing's leaking nothing's leaking everything

18:51.580 --> 18:56.140
Yeah, it's the tears of the fruit and vegetables that know that they'll never be

18:56.860 --> 19:02.220
They'll never live up to their purpose. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know what to do with these avocados. I think in this case though, like

19:03.060 --> 19:08.100
It's a it's it's wonderful because they're gonna go over right but go bad. Yeah, perfect. It's perfect

19:08.100 --> 19:10.380
It's a wonderful thing you're doing. Yeah, this is great

19:11.020 --> 19:13.020
What a sign help

19:13.460 --> 19:18.640
What a sign help? Well, I but we don't know the owners feelings about the avocados

19:18.640 --> 19:25.840
Well, but if you're worried about getting caught or whatever just leave a little sign that says I switched out my unripe avocado for your ripe

19:25.860 --> 19:26.740
avocado

19:26.740 --> 19:28.740
You're welcome

19:29.020 --> 19:33.020
This is it. No, this is a victimless crime. Okay, this is this is wild

19:33.020 --> 19:39.140
It you you could eat all their avocados when they get home. They're not gonna say shit to you. Do not even sweat it

19:40.460 --> 19:43.500
Hey, can we can we approach the Wizards throne?

19:44.300 --> 19:46.260
Yeah with deference

19:46.260 --> 19:48.180
Hang my head. Yes

19:48.180 --> 19:49.220
Okay

19:49.220 --> 19:53.060
No, he actually hates that you have to keep a constant eye contact with the wizard of the cloud

19:53.060 --> 19:57.020
Yeah, hang my head and make eye contact and bend the knee at the same time. Oh damn it

19:57.020 --> 20:00.660
Trap, he turned you into a fucking pig. Ah, that's what I wanted. Oh

20:00.660 --> 20:07.780
Oh good job. All right. Well, they're very smart. I know somebody who's got a birthday coming up

20:08.500 --> 20:09.500
Who?

20:09.500 --> 20:12.180
Yeah, I guess dad. Yeah

20:12.700 --> 20:15.300

20:15.740 --> 20:20.340

20:20.340 --> 20:24.220

That's perfect for our daddy

20:37.140 --> 20:38.940
I think we can all agree

20:38.940 --> 20:44.260
Les Mis is a fantastic musical beloved by millions around the world if you're a theater geek and want to proclaim your

20:44.420 --> 20:48.540
Enthusiastic admiration of Les Mis this guide will help you plan a fun party based on it. Yes

20:48.540 --> 20:55.020
Yes. Well, not let's not limit it because fans of French history will probably enjoy it as well

20:55.820 --> 21:02.440
Do fans of French history actually like Les Mis or does Les Mis take too many? Are there like people who are like, yeah

21:04.580 --> 21:09.140
Yeah, anyway prepare invitations your invitation should look old-fashioned

21:09.140 --> 21:15.580
Maybe written on old aged parchment paper in a fancy font and should quote some of the songs. Here's an example

21:15.580 --> 21:18.420
Do you hear the people sing the birthday song?

21:19.460 --> 21:21.900
Sorry, I'll try to get those in there a little more discreetly

21:21.900 --> 21:26.900
Do you hear the people sing the birthday song? The time is near eponine?

21:27.420 --> 21:29.900

22:19.580 --> 22:27.160
Anyway, bring your best singing voices Les Mis French revolution parentheses French Revolution more specifically June rebellion era. Ah fuck

22:28.100 --> 22:35.140
My only clean French Revolution costume is from the fucking July party era when they finished the rebellion

22:35.140 --> 22:41.380
And everybody was just like ripping it up and a loaf of bread come and a loaf of bread smiley face. Don't steal it. Oh

22:45.940 --> 22:47.940
Let's get some lyrics going

22:47.940 --> 22:51.380
If we could just I'm sure everybody's been sort of cooking some of the back of their head

22:51.660 --> 22:56.580
Here's the best that one that I've got right now at the end of the year. You're another you're older

22:57.820 --> 23:02.240
That's all you can say for the life of the poor and then you just keep going exactly the same way. Yeah

23:02.240 --> 23:04.400
That's pretty good. How about this?

23:05.280 --> 23:07.280
drink with me a

23:08.280 --> 23:10.760
Kool-aid zero sugar jammer

23:10.760 --> 23:34.920
My kids love those. Yeah. How about this? Who am I? I'm Derek's dad here in my bounty castle in the yard

23:34.920 --> 23:40.200
Oh, it's not bad. Yeah

23:41.080 --> 23:46.340
Damn, you know, I was about to say we're narrow casting right now, but I think we're pretty pretty well in the wheelhouse

23:49.000 --> 23:55.240
Okay decorate obviously you got to build a barricade hey wait, wait, nobody did your very suicide

23:55.240 --> 23:58.040
I'm trying to think man. I got stars. It's right there

23:59.160 --> 24:01.160
What about confrontation? Come on?

24:01.160 --> 24:06.720
Celebration. Yeah, that's easy. Oh, yeah. Perfect. Obviously you've got to build a barricade, hon

24:06.720 --> 24:09.320
Yeah, did you smash up all of our dining room chairs?

24:09.320 --> 24:12.720
I did do that because it's my fucking birthday dad

24:12.720 --> 24:18.040
Get the get the net or you go all the way out and build a ginormous one in your backyard with old junk

24:18.040 --> 24:23.080
You can even ask your guests to build old junk that they have and you could assemble it to build the building of the barricade

24:23.080 --> 24:27.160
At the party or pile up bits of furniture in the corners at home. So let me get this straight

24:27.160 --> 24:33.900
You want me to bring some of my old wooden furniture to your house? What are you planning to do with it? You'll see

24:36.520 --> 24:41.440
Are we gonna get to like eat pizza or something at some point no keep building the barricade

24:41.560 --> 24:47.720
But it's the army middle of your yard. What are you barricading against the French proletariat or something?

24:47.720 --> 24:51.880
I don't know. I don't know. I haven't seen the show you haven't seen the show

24:52.520 --> 24:54.520
Now I just love the posters

24:54.520 --> 24:57.880
Try to avoid balloon streamers or typical party stuff

24:57.880 --> 25:03.640
But if you absolutely need a birthday banner, then try having it be a neutral color with the Les Mis font on it

25:04.200 --> 25:06.200
No, you know the classic Les Mis font

25:06.320 --> 25:11.760
How about why can't we do just like big if you're gonna do streamers and shit just do red white and blue?

25:11.760 --> 25:13.280
No, it's red and black

25:13.280 --> 25:15.280
Red and black is even better

25:15.280 --> 25:18.160
Red, the color of the cake

25:19.040 --> 25:20.600
Black

25:20.600 --> 25:26.680
The color of the cake the both colors are on the cake the cake is mostly red

25:28.160 --> 25:30.160
Okay, it's a spider-man cake

25:34.040 --> 25:37.680
My am I the man the spider that they say I am

25:38.480 --> 25:43.120
My the Peter Parker how to throw a spider-man turn off the dark birthday party

25:45.720 --> 25:49.000
All right, everybody you see the barricade we built last year for the Les Mis party

25:49.000 --> 25:52.680
We're all gonna take turns jumping off of the top of it. Are you sure?

25:54.160 --> 26:00.040
And I'm sorry, I'm sorry Vicky. I guess I should say now at this boy a year out. You're right

26:00.040 --> 26:06.320
I did not clean it up. You were you are never got an after plan for the barricades

26:08.160 --> 26:10.320
Assumed it would wash away

26:10.880 --> 26:17.780
We got themed food get miniature sausages or hot dogs and stick toothpicks in them put papers on the toothpicks labeling them

26:17.780 --> 26:20.140
Kidney of a horse and liver of a cat

26:20.860 --> 26:22.260
Okay

26:22.260 --> 26:26.540
Fun fun loaves of freshly baked bread. You stole a loaf of bread and various fresh

26:26.540 --> 26:30.060
Well, it's second straight for the Jimmy Dean company showed up and they're like, how did you know?

26:32.620 --> 26:35.380
Red Kool-Aid and call it the blood of angry men

26:36.900 --> 26:40.020
And then there's a cake and you can make you a cake look like

26:40.460 --> 26:45.620
You could either have cakes look like they did in that era frost some kind of Les Mis design on it

26:45.620 --> 26:53.320
barricade etc or use some other kind of French dessert instead of a cake the clues are starting to point to this person genuinely not

26:53.320 --> 26:54.320
having

26:54.320 --> 26:58.000
Any idea what it is what the show at the very least?

26:58.000 --> 27:03.680
You should have to make your guests decide whether they want to have their cake or eat it, right?

27:03.680 --> 27:08.960
They shouldn't get to have they cannot get to do both. That's an excellent point Travis welcome the guests

27:08.960 --> 27:13.640
Okay, you're all ready for your party decked up in your best eponine costume and the guests begin to arrive

27:13.640 --> 27:16.040
Make sure the guests know that they must come dressed up to the party

27:16.040 --> 27:23.000
There'll be no talking only singing and some yelling when the battles come if they break that rule send them to Javert

27:23.000 --> 27:27.920
Oh, boy, dress up as Javert and tie them to a tree for five minutes or so. What?

27:28.840 --> 27:30.840
Excuse em wall

27:32.800 --> 27:39.860
Can you imagine anyone that like just popping their head over the fence and seeing this and there's like a 13 year old kid

27:39.860 --> 27:46.600
I love I love this party. I love everything that we've done. I love all the plans

27:47.120 --> 27:53.760
What I am thinking about is the moment when I've got it all set and then I realized that it's the child's birthday

27:53.760 --> 28:00.640
And I do have to invite grandpa Dan. Yes, because grandpa Dan is gonna have to come and see all this happen

28:00.640 --> 28:02.640
He's gonna try to talk around to be like

28:02.880 --> 28:04.880
No, you gotta go to Javert

28:04.880 --> 28:10.160
You gotta go to Javert. He's gonna tie you to the tree. Remember next time sing or scream

28:10.280 --> 28:15.340
Those are the two options Dan. What I love too is just listening to this you get such a great

28:15.720 --> 28:18.600
Like there's this scale of like age

28:19.360 --> 28:21.360
plus this party

28:21.760 --> 28:29.160
Equals fun question mark and like there's a track because at like 19 right in theater school you throw this party

28:29.220 --> 28:32.180
It's a rager, right? This is amazing, right?

28:32.180 --> 28:36.420
12 years old you throw this party. No one comes, right?

28:36.980 --> 28:43.900
Now here's my question. Is there an age past let's say 30 where this really hits?

28:45.820 --> 28:47.300
No, I mean

28:47.300 --> 28:54.400
40 is what I am and I would be very into somebody putting this kind of work into a party

28:54.400 --> 28:58.940
Yeah, but it doesn't even really matter. I would just love a theme, you know. Yeah, right. I miss it

28:58.940 --> 29:03.580
This is this is still part of welcome the guests a play lame is soundtrack throughout the party

29:03.580 --> 29:10.240
But don't watch the movie adaptation from 2011. Some guests may not consider it appropriate. Even if you fast-forward through lovely ladies

29:10.840 --> 29:15.660
Which I guess is this a very sexual song from the movie the 10th anniversary concert from

29:17.860 --> 29:24.040
The 10th anniversary concert from 1998 is less visually explicit. So oh if we could talk about that fucking show

29:24.040 --> 29:28.800
Call Wilkinson. Call Wilkinson. Are you kidding me? Oh my god, huh?

29:29.440 --> 29:31.440
He'll my prayer. Who am I?

29:32.040 --> 29:36.040
Who am I? Can I take him this mountain to slavery slavery?

29:36.960 --> 29:41.000
Fucking call William Wilkinson and then what is the best is at the end?

29:41.120 --> 29:46.960
They have all the Jean Valjeans ever from all costs of planet and they all come in and sing their own lay misses

29:47.040 --> 29:52.840
They come in and sing their own. Who am I? Are you kidding me with that credible? It's incredible this version of it

29:52.840 --> 29:57.360
I want this party now. I've just sent travel away. Just be quiet everybody shut up

30:23.840 --> 30:25.840
I

30:36.160 --> 30:38.160
Come

30:45.520 --> 30:47.040
Fuck yeah

30:47.040 --> 30:54.660
The best yeah, it's the best. Can you imagine? That's what you play open and close with the planet of Valjeans. Yeah

30:55.800 --> 31:02.660
I just sent Justin and Travis some key art from this wikiHow article that I know this visual humor doesn't play at home

31:02.660 --> 31:07.600
but it's just two boys with their arms around each other standing in front of a door with a small welcome banner on it and

31:07.600 --> 31:13.680
Then for a what appears to be my god 15 foot tall man dressed up as Javert

31:13.680 --> 31:18.840
I believe they're either three feet tall or he is ten feet. Yeah, that's pretty excellent

31:18.840 --> 31:21.280
Oh god, we got to put that I'll put that up

31:21.280 --> 31:24.680
So the final tip is just to play games but tweak the names and rules

31:25.000 --> 31:29.380
So that they're lame is theme pin the tail on the donkey could be pin the bread on Valjean

31:29.760 --> 31:32.760
What no in the crime on someone else?

31:33.240 --> 31:36.480
That's a crime is amorphous. They've done that

31:37.040 --> 31:41.600
This is what I'm saying. That's what who am I is. It's pinning the crime on another man

31:41.600 --> 31:45.120
I know but a crime you can't fucking pick you start to play it. Yeah

31:46.920 --> 31:54.040
So now you could pin that pin this silver candle sick on Valjean and he's got the one in your you take on the role

31:54.040 --> 31:59.680
Okay in this in this pin the tail game. I'll be in having the role of the priest the kindly priest. It looks after Valjean

32:00.480 --> 32:02.480
mon senior bienvenue

32:03.160 --> 32:08.580
This is name. I only know isn't it weird out with some things like lame is I

32:08.580 --> 32:13.020
Can't think of a time in my life where if you'd asked me like are you fucking deep in the pain?

32:14.340 --> 32:18.220
Yeah, absolutely. I'm very deep in the pain of lame is and just like at some point

32:18.220 --> 32:22.700
It's like apparently I've absorbed all this. Yeah, and I'm extremely deep in the pain. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you want to know?

32:22.700 --> 32:27.780
What do you want to know? Yeah. Yeah anything all the songs all the lyrics apparently I did like I did this intentionally with rent

32:27.780 --> 32:30.260
But with lame is I just sort of I don't know. Yeah, I can't

32:30.740 --> 32:34.900
The botany class I took in college, but do you want to hear all the lyrics to master the house?

32:34.900 --> 32:38.540
Let's set it to the tune of fucking stars, and we'll talk yeah

32:39.260 --> 32:42.300
Quick break, and then we'll come right back to talking about layman

32:53.260 --> 32:57.420
You want to make a lame is a rob fan site the

33:00.220 --> 33:02.220
You can call it a

33:02.220 --> 33:08.240
Lame is a lay happy Rob because it makes you happy because your name is Rob, and you're

Since the dawn of time screenwriters have taken months to craft their stories

35:46.780 --> 35:51.660
But now three Hollywood professionals shall attempt the impossible

35:52.020 --> 35:56.340
Break a story in one hour. That's right here on story break

35:56.340 --> 35:59.580
I Freddie Wong Matt Arnold and Will Campos the creators behind

35:59.780 --> 36:06.200
Award-winning shows like video game high school have one hour to turn a humble idea into an awesome movie now an awesome movie starts with an

36:06.200 --> 36:12.100
Awesome title. I chose the billionaires marriage Valley. Mine was Christmas pregnant paradise

36:12.700 --> 36:17.440
Okay, next we need a protagonist. So I've heard Wario best described as libertarian

36:18.340 --> 36:24.180
And of course every great movie needs a stellar pitch in order to get to heaven. Sometimes you got to raise a little hell

36:25.820 --> 36:30.340
Check out story break every week on maximum fun org or wherever you get your podcasts

36:30.340 --> 36:32.340
You

36:34.220 --> 36:36.780
Yeah, hey Dave this party sounds great, where's it at

36:43.940 --> 36:47.380
That's the last one that's that's all I got that's the last one

36:47.380 --> 36:50.540
But you did run a real risk of pivoting us right back in time

36:50.540 --> 36:55.500
I know if I could say it's reckless I was right now, but you know what? That's me

36:55.500 --> 37:02.100
I'm kind of the bad boy of the layman's scene, you know, it's sad. I was just looking for like when you mentioned layman's fansite

37:02.100 --> 37:07.780
I thought oh, that would be fun. I'm gonna find one of those. You can't find fucking fansites anymore. It's all been commoditized

37:08.460 --> 37:11.900
Wiki, yes, you know what I mean? You can't just like get into like a dirty

37:13.180 --> 37:15.500
Geocities web rang and just surf for a little

37:15.500 --> 37:24.860
It's not a mumble there and it's kind of like just it is it was very obvious cities. Hold on one second just cities calm everyone be patient

37:24.860 --> 37:27.300
Hey, everybody you are else on this show

37:28.140 --> 37:33.620
He didn't even say URL this time. I just kind of thought wait just cities calm find your domain

37:33.620 --> 37:39.700
Okay, let's let me check this register. Okay, honey, please be taken. It's not taken

37:39.700 --> 37:46.920
I can get it. Wait, I type. Okay, wait little brain for here. I didn't type jizzdomain.com

37:48.180 --> 37:54.540
That is also available. I might have to get both jizz cities and jizz domain

37:57.100 --> 38:01.940
Available I'm leaving jizz domain. You can have it friends whoever gets to it first

38:03.100 --> 38:08.860
It's it's right there for you. If you just can someone please make juice domain redirect to jizz cities

38:08.860 --> 38:10.860
That would be

38:12.460 --> 38:16.140
But I'm gonna make just just domain so

38:18.860 --> 38:21.780
Well, that'll teach them to search for something so naughty

38:22.220 --> 38:26.220
How I dang it done melted my damn computer down. Why did I search for jizz cities?

38:26.220 --> 38:33.360
What were you doing better it imploded it sucked in on itself like a black hole. No nothing. What were you doing on it?

38:33.940 --> 38:35.940
Well, I was searching for jizz domain

38:35.940 --> 38:39.700
Okay, look like you were trying to go to a website when the computer

38:40.260 --> 38:45.220
Sort of dissolved. Yeah, it's club penguin club penguins been closed for many years

38:48.860 --> 38:50.860
There's a guy

38:52.260 --> 38:56.020
This is on so there's a Canadian version of Dragon's Den

38:57.140 --> 39:02.340
And there is a guy out there who came on a couple seasons ago. Whose name is currently

39:03.340 --> 39:05.340
Escaping me. I'll find it just a second

39:05.340 --> 39:09.860
But he is the dude behind Club Penguin and no matter who's Lane

39:10.140 --> 39:15.300
Merrifield is the same and no matter who comes out there every time this man opens his mouth practically

39:15.300 --> 39:17.660
He's like, you know what I created Club

39:21.100 --> 39:26.860
Like incredibly rich because everything that you think is uncool it has made a billion dollars, okay

39:28.380 --> 39:33.180
I'm gonna bring it in because I feel like things are getting a little out of hand a bit a little odd hand

39:33.180 --> 39:38.180
I walk quietly and as a result, I always startle people when I just appear out of nowhere

39:38.380 --> 39:41.460
I'm about to move in with five new roommates

39:41.460 --> 39:47.020
I mentioned this to them and they all said it would freak them out for sure

39:47.460 --> 39:51.500
So how do I stop jump-scared people slash seeming like a magician?

39:52.620 --> 39:54.620
That's from Christopher walking

39:55.820 --> 39:59.940
They've also added PS no tap shoes on for chart hardwood flooring, which is

40:00.700 --> 40:02.300
That's an excuse

40:02.300 --> 40:05.140
Yeah, that is an excuse. You could you could do it good

40:06.060 --> 40:11.620
Traction becomes now this is this is where I really think if I may a sign might help

40:12.380 --> 40:16.980
Because much like you are driving down the road, right and there's like watch out for deer signs

40:16.980 --> 40:23.560
And I might not see a deer, but I'm ready to see a deer. Maybe you just have like watch out for Dave

40:23.560 --> 40:31.080
or or don't here's here's my thinking on this one this this is

40:32.840 --> 40:40.200
This is a them problem, it's not even a them problem it's a them opportunity because you are giving them a

40:41.200 --> 40:42.680
an

40:42.680 --> 40:44.680
intensive training protocol

40:45.160 --> 40:52.160
For situational awareness you want to stop being afraid by me when I appear when you weren't expecting me

40:52.160 --> 40:54.160
Then know where I am at all times

40:55.040 --> 40:58.060
Train your train your mind to have complete

40:59.360 --> 41:04.840
Perception of the world around you that's an incredible skill that you're giving them

41:04.840 --> 41:10.480
And then you're gonna scare them so bad a few times and they're gonna spill a big bowl of soup on

41:10.920 --> 41:16.000
Their body and it's gonna hurt a lot. But pain is weakness leaving the body

41:16.000 --> 41:19.760
I think that the problem is you run the risk of

41:19.760 --> 41:22.680
Surprising them and them hurting you

41:23.600 --> 41:29.920
Yeah, sometimes that's you're gonna get a little soup on you, but your pain is their weakness

41:30.880 --> 41:35.360
Entering your body. Yeah, that's what they say. Maybe you could announce yourself

41:36.200 --> 41:41.280
Or oh even better. You're gonna need a Herald my friend a

41:41.960 --> 41:44.080
Herald yeah someone who announces you

41:44.080 --> 41:51.280
Someone who goes before you. Oh, not an HR. Okay. No, no, no, they blow a little trumpet and say presenting

41:51.760 --> 41:55.320
Steve what if you're just going to the shitter doesn't matter

41:56.840 --> 41:58.760
Steve's going to shit

41:58.760 --> 42:04.480
What if you're just passing through the veranda a virtual eyes Steve approaches?

42:04.480 --> 42:07.920
I don't need to be announced every time I'm going back to get more bagel chips

42:07.920 --> 42:09.920
You know

42:13.200 --> 42:16.600
Did we already say a bill I mean no cuz it's a person

42:17.280 --> 42:22.260
If it is a person, but it's not cool that we do it to anybody, you know cows are like

42:23.600 --> 42:25.800
Sucks this fucking bill

42:28.280 --> 42:30.880
Get all of your roommates heat vision goggles

42:30.880 --> 42:37.640
Mmm. Oh turn off all the lights now. Everybody's mysterious level the playing fields

42:38.200 --> 42:43.880
That's cool. That's cool. Hey, guess what? If you live with five other people

42:45.000 --> 42:49.360
You you do not it is wild to ever be surprised

42:50.320 --> 42:54.560
By seeing someone. Yeah, not I mean like I don't know

42:54.560 --> 42:59.200
I don't know how big the space is that you're you're living in but when you cohabitate with that many people

42:59.200 --> 43:01.200
Just assume

43:01.320 --> 43:08.280
Around every corner. There is a there is a human soul and I I don't know why you would do any differently

43:09.120 --> 43:13.560
What the fuck's a person doing here? There's five of us. What about how else?

43:14.120 --> 43:15.720
What do you know?

43:15.720 --> 43:17.720
Hot wheels all over the floor. Oh

43:18.760 --> 43:20.760
Can't help. Yeah. Ouch

43:20.760 --> 43:26.680
Legos, I guess would serve the same purpose if you're constantly walking, but down the hall going yeah

43:26.680 --> 43:30.840
Well, you could just do that with ruffled potato chips to less painful

43:30.840 --> 43:35.040
But very loud scatter some dried leaves around a lot of twigs

43:35.920 --> 43:37.760
Tried leaves and twigs would be good

43:37.760 --> 43:38.200
Yeah

43:38.200 --> 43:44.800
And it's good for the environment because that's gonna naturally compost and you're gonna get a lovely forest floor in your apartment

43:45.280 --> 43:46.880
Yeah

43:46.880 --> 43:48.880
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. Yeah

43:49.160 --> 43:51.160
dumb

43:51.160 --> 43:55.800
But I want a munch

43:58.960 --> 44:00.960
I want much

44:01.580 --> 44:03.040
bob

44:03.040 --> 44:07.640
bub bub who put the Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob in much squad

44:09.320 --> 44:15.560
This I have a munch quad mini and then a full munch quad investigation, okay, so we're gonna begin with this

44:16.360 --> 44:18.640
Because what this is kind of a special episode for us

44:18.640 --> 44:20.640
I don't know if you guys realize,

44:20.640 --> 44:23.840
but this is our Shark Week episode.

44:23.840 --> 44:25.560
We're recording, you know,

44:25.560 --> 44:27.160
not releasing during Shark Week, obviously,

44:27.160 --> 44:29.000
but like recording during Shark Week.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.600
So if we seem a little observed.

44:31.600 --> 44:34.720
Yes, if we seem a little, you know, sharked up.

44:34.720 --> 44:35.560
Yeah.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.000
And we're not the only ones taking advantage

44:40.000 --> 44:43.580
because Sonic Drive-In is also,

44:43.580 --> 44:44.420
did you know, by the way,

44:44.420 --> 44:46.680
that they're putting a Sonic in next to the Walmart

44:46.680 --> 44:47.720
where the Bojangles used to be?

44:47.720 --> 44:48.760
Yeah. No.

44:48.760 --> 44:49.680
What a coup.

44:49.680 --> 44:52.080
Yeah, it's a big, it's a big glow up.

44:53.240 --> 44:56.920
So Sonic Drive-In introduced the new Shark Week slush.

44:58.400 --> 45:01.840
Now, there's many different ways that this could have gone,

45:01.840 --> 45:04.320
but it ended up going the weirdest possible way.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.760
The limited time slush is,

45:06.760 --> 45:08.960
if I told you guys that this is not a cheap cash-in,

45:08.960 --> 45:11.560
but rather an opportunity, an attempt rather,

45:11.560 --> 45:13.240
to capture the grace and beauty of sharks

45:13.240 --> 45:15.480
with a slushie drink, you would not believe me,

45:15.480 --> 45:17.340
but that is exactly what has transpired here.

45:17.340 --> 45:19.600
The limited time only slush is a diorama

45:19.600 --> 45:22.400
of refreshing tropical flavor to delight the senses

45:22.400 --> 45:24.000
while diving into one of the Discovery's

45:24.000 --> 45:27.120
most anticipated programs of the summer, Shark Week.

45:27.120 --> 45:29.340
How is it a diorama?

45:29.340 --> 45:32.920
Well, bud, the eye-catching Shark Week slush

45:32.920 --> 45:35.600
has layers of fun with real strawberries

45:35.600 --> 45:40.600
and two shark gummies atop an ice cold blue coconut slush,

45:41.480 --> 45:46.480
creating a feeding frenzy for shark aficionados for $2.99,

45:46.480 --> 45:50.040
which I think we'll all agree is a steal.

45:50.880 --> 45:52.840
I've linked you a picture so you can see.

45:52.840 --> 45:54.160
Basically, you got a blue slush,

45:54.160 --> 45:58.440
you got a big, big mound of cherry,

45:58.440 --> 46:02.040
and then the two gummy sharks on top.

46:02.040 --> 46:02.880
Awesome.

46:02.880 --> 46:06.320
Yeah, no, it definitely looks like just sort of stagnant gore

46:07.560 --> 46:10.600
nestled atop some antifreeze.

46:10.600 --> 46:11.440
Yeah.

46:11.440 --> 46:12.260
Yeah.

46:12.260 --> 46:14.160
We're excited to capture the beauty of Shark Week.

46:14.160 --> 46:15.560
It looks like a lot of work

46:15.560 --> 46:17.720
for an underpaid employee.

46:17.720 --> 46:20.120
Yeah, they're never gonna look like this, though.

46:20.120 --> 46:21.340
Enjoy this picture.

46:21.340 --> 46:23.240
You'll never see one like this in the wild.

46:23.240 --> 46:25.560
We're excited to capture the beauty of Shark Week

46:25.560 --> 46:29.040
and the awe-inspiring ocean life the program showcases

46:29.040 --> 46:32.540
in an exhilarating treat with a trifecta of flavors.

46:32.540 --> 46:34.280
It's worth noting those trifecta of flavors

46:34.280 --> 46:38.120
are blood, coconut, and shark gummy,

46:38.120 --> 46:40.800
so we've really captured the spirit of the thing,

46:40.800 --> 46:43.640
says Scott, the vice president of product innovation

46:43.640 --> 46:44.960
and development for Sonic.

46:44.960 --> 46:47.320
The beachy cool blue coconut slush lays

46:47.320 --> 46:50.920
a bright aquatic blue base down for shark gummy candies

46:50.920 --> 46:55.200
and juicy strawberries, creating a vivid ocean scene

46:55.200 --> 46:58.440
within a slush for guests to celebrate

46:58.440 --> 47:00.560
both the magnificent creatures

47:00.560 --> 47:02.960
and the delicious fun of summer.

47:02.960 --> 47:07.700
So you really celebrate sharks, their very existence,

47:07.700 --> 47:09.740
with this slushing.

47:09.740 --> 47:12.600
So it's just yet another way to honor sharks,

47:12.600 --> 47:13.600
and that's wonderful.

47:13.600 --> 47:16.880
But for one sea lion, but the thing about this slush

47:16.880 --> 47:19.600
that I wanna be really clear about

47:19.600 --> 47:22.840
is it contains no shark.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.080
That is important.

47:24.080 --> 47:26.520
Not even a bit of shark.

47:26.520 --> 47:27.720
Right.

47:27.720 --> 47:29.600
No shark DNA is present in this shirt.

47:29.600 --> 47:30.800
No, I mean, we're all stardust, aren't we?

47:30.800 --> 47:32.600
We're all stardust, man.

47:32.600 --> 47:35.540
Yeah, but you could say that this is a place

47:35.540 --> 47:38.560
where you wouldn't expect to find fish.

47:38.560 --> 47:41.580
One place you might expect to find fish

47:41.580 --> 47:42.880
is in a Subway Toonison.

47:42.880 --> 47:46.560
Oh, no, this is ongoing? Oh, yeah, for sure.

47:46.560 --> 47:48.400
This is ongoing, folks.

47:48.400 --> 47:52.700
This story will not die to catch you up.

47:54.040 --> 47:59.040
The New York Times did a test on Subway Tuna

47:59.400 --> 48:02.340
and said there is no tuna at all,

48:02.340 --> 48:04.640
not even the trace amounts of tuna

48:04.640 --> 48:07.240
that you'd expect to find in any one of us.

48:07.240 --> 48:10.120
There's no tuna in it at all.

48:10.120 --> 48:12.400
This happened, and everyone kinda looked at each other like,

48:12.400 --> 48:13.920
so what do we do now?

48:13.920 --> 48:15.600
What do you want me to do with this information, New York Times?

48:15.600 --> 48:16.440
What do we do with this information?

48:16.440 --> 48:18.000
And if I remember correctly,

48:18.000 --> 48:21.400
the head of Subway or someone stood by their guns

48:21.400 --> 48:24.280
and said, no, it's tuna, and they're like, it's not.

48:24.280 --> 48:26.640
Subway, yeah, Subway says it's 100,

48:26.640 --> 48:30.440
it's absolutely tuna, no question.

48:30.440 --> 48:31.600
This story is ongoing.

48:31.600 --> 48:35.660
This lawsuit started in January.

48:35.660 --> 48:40.660
Subway CEO said, and this is a direct quote,

48:46.180 --> 48:49.820
he absolutely eats Subway's tuna sandwiches.

48:49.820 --> 48:51.260
Oh, he doesn't, then.

48:51.260 --> 48:53.620
No, he's never had any of them.

48:53.620 --> 48:57.780
No, no, no, he absolutely, definitely

48:57.780 --> 48:59.220
eats Subway sandwiches.

48:59.220 --> 49:02.540
He says, it's one of my two favorite sandwiches.

49:02.540 --> 49:05.300
Not, what's the other one?

49:05.300 --> 49:08.940
Just say it's your second favorite sandwich.

49:10.580 --> 49:12.620
He said it's definitely tuna.

49:12.620 --> 49:15.020
He said he absolutely eats them.

49:15.020 --> 49:17.060
This is just, hey, listen, this is just one on one.

49:17.060 --> 49:18.620
If you're ever trying to get away with a crime

49:18.620 --> 49:20.080
and you're brought in for questioning,

49:20.080 --> 49:23.920
don't start off with, I definitely didn't kill him,

49:23.920 --> 49:26.920
and I am absolutely not a murderer.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.980
So they're saying it's tuna.

49:28.980 --> 49:30.700
How far are they are willing to go?

49:30.700 --> 49:34.340
They've launched a website called,

49:34.340 --> 49:37.100
and the website is, let me get the URL for you.

49:37.100 --> 49:38.860
Jizzdomain.com.

49:38.860 --> 49:43.860
It's Jizzdomain, no, SubwayTunaFacts.com.

49:44.100 --> 49:45.900
So if you go to Subway Tuna Facts,

49:45.900 --> 49:47.100
you're gonna see a huge banner,

49:47.100 --> 49:49.580
and it says, I'll just read it to you,

49:49.580 --> 49:53.000
even though I'm probably, this is probably propaganda,

49:53.880 --> 49:57.500
arguably, Subway Tuna is real tuna.

49:57.500 --> 49:58.600
That's right.

49:58.600 --> 50:03.100
The truth is Subway uses wild-caught skipjack tuna

50:03.100 --> 50:05.900
regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

50:05.900 --> 50:09.060
A favorite among sub lovers, our tuna is,

50:09.060 --> 50:14.060
and always has been, high quality, premium, and 100% real.

50:14.780 --> 50:16.900
Now, we know there's been a lot of talk on this topic,

50:16.900 --> 50:19.820
including misinformation generated in the media,

50:19.820 --> 50:23.020
so we created this page to set forth the facts

50:23.020 --> 50:26.340
and help clarify any misunderstandings.

50:26.340 --> 50:28.540
Myth, the New York Times reported

50:28.540 --> 50:32.340
the Subway's premium fan favorite tuna wasn't actually tuna.

50:32.340 --> 50:36.500
The New York Times said our kick-ass tuna isn't tuna.

50:36.500 --> 50:40.100
And I would actually argue, what you stated is a truth.

50:40.100 --> 50:43.060
That did happen, that's not a myth.

50:43.060 --> 50:44.700
Myth, the New York Times reported

50:44.700 --> 50:48.220
Subway's premium fan favorite tuna wasn't actually tuna.

50:48.220 --> 50:50.020
Truth, not true.

50:50.020 --> 50:53.340
What actually happened is that the New York Times

50:53.340 --> 50:56.900
commissioned a test that couldn't detect tuna DNA

50:56.900 --> 50:58.140
in their sample.

50:58.140 --> 50:59.100
Okay.

50:59.100 --> 51:01.540
But according to scientific experts,

51:01.540 --> 51:04.580
this is not unusual when testing cooked tuna,

51:04.580 --> 51:08.260
and it absolutely doesn't mean the sample that was tested

51:08.260 --> 51:10.300
contained zero tuna.

51:10.300 --> 51:11.140
Do you understand?

51:11.140 --> 51:12.820
Oh boy, I'm getting kind of swayed.

51:14.900 --> 51:17.620
USA Today did an independent fact check

51:17.620 --> 51:19.020
of the New York Times conclusion,

51:19.020 --> 51:20.940
which found it lacked important context

51:20.940 --> 51:24.420
about the limitations of DNA testing in denatured proteins,

51:24.420 --> 51:28.740
which you would expect in a cooked down tuna product.

51:28.740 --> 51:29.860
I see.

51:29.860 --> 51:34.380
So by cooking the tuna, all that important tuna DNA.

51:34.380 --> 51:36.100
They cook the DNA right out of it.

51:36.100 --> 51:41.020
You reduce it to create that strong tuna flavor.

51:42.420 --> 51:44.980
Now they've got a chart here

51:44.980 --> 51:47.460
that shows sort of the flow of it.

51:49.540 --> 51:51.260
And it says at the top of the chart,

51:51.260 --> 51:53.060
Subway tuna is real tuna.

51:53.060 --> 51:53.900
Okay.

51:53.900 --> 51:57.580
And they're just really banging that drum extremely hard.

51:57.580 --> 51:59.020
One thing that would be,

51:59.020 --> 52:02.100
I feel like the problem is,

52:02.100 --> 52:03.740
is that we're getting into this,

52:03.740 --> 52:06.300
like we've always been at war with Eurasia territory,

52:06.300 --> 52:07.900
where the New York Times,

52:07.900 --> 52:09.500
our most respected publication says,

52:09.500 --> 52:10.900
this is not tuna.

52:10.900 --> 52:13.460
And then Subway says, I believe you're mistaken.

52:13.460 --> 52:14.500
This is tuna.

52:14.500 --> 52:16.900
In fact, it's all tuna, baby.

52:16.900 --> 52:19.980
Like there's no middle ground in this.

52:19.980 --> 52:23.740
One person just says, this is absolutely not tuna.

52:23.740 --> 52:27.220
And Subway says, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, it's tuna.

52:27.220 --> 52:30.140
What they lack in this entire webpage

52:30.140 --> 52:34.700
is one picture of a man or woman catching a tuna

52:34.700 --> 52:37.380
and saying, this is going straight to Subway.

52:39.180 --> 52:40.860
I'm shipping this to Subway.

52:40.860 --> 52:42.060
You can watch.

52:42.060 --> 52:45.780
I need to at this point fucking GoPro a tuna

52:45.780 --> 52:49.420
throughout the processing until it's in someone's mouth.

52:49.420 --> 52:50.540
That's what I need.

52:50.540 --> 52:52.220
I need that level.

52:52.220 --> 52:57.220
Does anybody read this on the planet Earth?

52:57.460 --> 53:00.900
Does any sapient being on the planet Earth

53:00.900 --> 53:02.540
read this website and go,

53:02.540 --> 53:04.980
you know what I could fucking go for right now?

53:06.140 --> 53:08.140
You know what I would crush right about now?

53:08.140 --> 53:11.060
I tell you, it's kind of convincing.

53:11.060 --> 53:12.660
You're Travis.

53:12.660 --> 53:15.180
Now listen, now listen, now listen, now listen.

53:15.180 --> 53:18.180
Am I saying I believe it's 100% tuna?

53:18.180 --> 53:20.460
No, of course not.

53:20.460 --> 53:23.420
Am I saying I believe it's 100% digestible?

53:23.420 --> 53:24.940
Yeah, sure.

53:24.940 --> 53:26.540
And now listen guys,

53:26.540 --> 53:29.980
here's where the plot fucking gets really rippled.

53:29.980 --> 53:32.700
Here's where the plot gets really thick.

53:33.740 --> 53:38.100
The day, and I'm looking at the timestamps here.

53:38.100 --> 53:40.580
This story from Grace Dean in Business Insider

53:40.580 --> 53:43.940
about Subway launching the tuna website is from July 14th.

53:43.940 --> 53:48.940
The day before July 13th in the QSR magazine,

53:48.940 --> 53:51.900
which is my sort of go-to for quick service restaurant.

53:51.900 --> 53:53.020
I would trust them over anybody.

53:53.020 --> 53:53.860
More than the New York Times.

53:53.860 --> 53:54.780
They are the paper of record.

53:54.780 --> 53:58.500
Yeah, the New York Times of burger boys.

53:58.500 --> 54:01.380
Subway launches unprecedented campaign

54:01.380 --> 54:03.740
to support menu updates.

54:03.740 --> 54:04.820
Okay.

54:04.820 --> 54:07.260
It's called the Eat Fresh Refresh,

54:07.260 --> 54:12.140
which features more than 20 changes to core items.

54:12.140 --> 54:14.540
It will be supported with multi-platform content

54:14.540 --> 54:17.260
from Steph Curry, Serena Williams,

54:17.260 --> 54:19.740
Tom Brady.

54:19.740 --> 54:22.180
Wait, are they all making sandwiches?

54:22.180 --> 54:24.140
It's an extraordinary group of athletes

54:24.140 --> 54:27.660
that reinforce the scope of these tremendous changes

54:27.660 --> 54:31.140
and embody the idea that to be fresh,

54:31.140 --> 54:32.580
you need to refresh.

54:32.580 --> 54:34.740
Hey, I'm Tom Brady and this is my sandwich.

54:34.740 --> 54:35.860
It's two pieces of bread

54:35.860 --> 54:39.300
and then there's a sealy sort of mattress between them

54:39.300 --> 54:40.460
and I just eat it.

54:40.460 --> 54:41.300
I eat all of it.

54:41.300 --> 54:43.140
Just so you guys don't think I'm making this up,

54:43.140 --> 54:44.980
I have one of these ads for you right here.

54:44.980 --> 54:46.100
It's six seconds long.

54:46.100 --> 54:47.380
Here we go.

54:47.380 --> 54:49.860
There's so much new at Subway, it won't fit in one ad.

54:49.860 --> 54:51.340
So they're sandwiching the sandwich ads

54:51.340 --> 54:53.020
between other ads.

54:53.020 --> 54:55.260
That's a real one.

54:55.260 --> 54:57.540
That's a real ad, a real six second ad

54:57.540 --> 55:00.100
that Subway's doing with Charles Barkley

55:00.100 --> 55:02.180
as the new voice of Subway.

55:02.180 --> 55:04.060
I love that. He's made it.

55:04.060 --> 55:07.140
It says here, I will lend his humor and familiar tone

55:07.140 --> 55:08.260
as the new voice of Subway.

55:08.260 --> 55:09.260
I love that dude.

55:09.260 --> 55:11.820
Yeah, I like his familiar tone.

55:11.820 --> 55:14.580
So it's a huge, I mean, there's all kinds of big changes.

55:14.580 --> 55:17.500
They improved their turkey, ham, steak, and bacon.

55:17.500 --> 55:19.100
Pretty low bar.

55:19.100 --> 55:20.820
Well, and the rotisserie chicken.

55:20.820 --> 55:22.540
And they elevate, that's a lot of proteins.

55:22.540 --> 55:24.260
That's all of it, guys.

55:24.260 --> 55:26.980
Hey, well, no Griffin, it's not all of it.

55:26.980 --> 55:30.580
Cause that, is there one protein

55:30.580 --> 55:32.340
continuously absent from that list?

55:33.500 --> 55:35.100
Oh, the tuna?

55:35.100 --> 55:36.740
It's perfect.

55:36.740 --> 55:37.580
Can't be improved.

55:37.580 --> 55:39.780
It's perfect and real and we can't evolve it.

55:39.780 --> 55:43.140
Cause it's so real that it's a hundred percent tuna.

55:43.140 --> 55:45.420
You know what, in fact, now that we think about it,

55:45.420 --> 55:46.780
it's great that you brought out how much

55:46.780 --> 55:48.820
we fucking love our tuna.

55:48.820 --> 55:50.900
Cause we need to fix our chicken and bacon

55:50.900 --> 55:52.620
and everything else but tuna.

55:52.620 --> 55:55.820
So we'll live up to the standards

55:55.820 --> 55:59.340
that our 100% actual tuna is sitting.

55:59.340 --> 56:01.580
We asked Branson, we said, hey, while you're up there,

56:01.580 --> 56:03.340
keep your eyes out for space tuna.

56:03.340 --> 56:05.980
Cause that's the only way it's getting better, my man.

56:05.980 --> 56:08.860
Something has got to help top this.

56:08.860 --> 56:11.740
Our other meats are, if they'd come, you know what,

56:11.740 --> 56:13.820
honestly, now that I think about it, folks,

56:13.820 --> 56:15.980
if they'd come for any of our other meats,

56:15.980 --> 56:20.180
the bacon, that's old belts, 100% it's old belts.

56:20.180 --> 56:21.020
You got us.

56:21.020 --> 56:24.260
We've been doing plant-based chicken for 30 years, okay?

56:24.260 --> 56:28.940
It's all fake bullshit, but the tuna, it's perfect and real

56:28.940 --> 56:30.220
and it's real tuna.

56:30.220 --> 56:33.220
What's a shame is that Branson could have found space tuna

56:33.220 --> 56:36.540
and come back and be like, good news, Subway, space tuna.

56:36.540 --> 56:39.340
It tastes a hundred percent better and fresher.

56:39.340 --> 56:41.460
So go ahead and toss that on the menu.

56:41.460 --> 56:46.220
And then Dr. Subway was like, we fucking, we fuck, we can't

56:46.220 --> 56:47.580
because everybody will think it's a New York Times

56:47.580 --> 56:49.460
switcheroo, swap-a-rooney, damn it.

56:49.460 --> 56:51.300
Fuck, why did the New York Times have to write that article

56:51.300 --> 56:54.020
so we can't put kick-ass space tuna in our sandwiches?

56:54.020 --> 56:55.860
The optics, Branson, were so bad.

56:55.860 --> 56:56.900
You blew it again.

56:56.900 --> 56:58.140
You blew it.

56:58.140 --> 57:00.860
Oh my God, this is a quote from the CEO of Subway.

57:00.860 --> 57:04.220
We've been working on this refresh for 15 to 16 months.

57:04.220 --> 57:06.580
And if you notice, the one thing we did not touch

57:06.580 --> 57:07.420
is our tuna.

57:08.860 --> 57:10.500
People love our tuna.

57:10.500 --> 57:12.340
We're very proud of our tuna.

57:12.340 --> 57:14.860
So I think that's really the end of the story.

57:14.860 --> 57:16.020
Guys, that's his quote.

57:16.020 --> 57:18.300
They're like quintupling down.

57:18.300 --> 57:20.380
And that comes, by the way, at the end of the story

57:20.380 --> 57:21.900
in Business Insider.

57:21.900 --> 57:22.740
I love it.

57:22.740 --> 57:26.180
It's the CEO like, oh, so the last thing I wanted to say

57:26.180 --> 57:29.460
is that the tuna is real and we're all agreed on that.

57:29.460 --> 57:31.660
You could just put a period right there

57:31.660 --> 57:32.540
and that's the end of it.

57:32.540 --> 57:35.100
And I feel like the one thing we could all agree on

57:35.100 --> 57:36.700
is that our bacon has always been bad

57:36.700 --> 57:39.940
and hopefully now it's better and that our tuna is real.

57:39.940 --> 57:41.100
And that's it.

57:41.100 --> 57:42.660
That's the whole review by.

57:43.940 --> 57:45.340
Oh, we're sorry about Jared, by the way.

57:45.340 --> 57:47.980
I'm sure we should say still sorry about Jared.

57:47.980 --> 57:48.980
Still bugged up on that one.

57:48.980 --> 57:50.700
But the tuna, perfect.

57:50.700 --> 57:52.700
Tuna, oh baby.

57:52.700 --> 57:57.700
And I would say at this point with absolute certainty

57:58.140 --> 58:01.060
that the New York Times' two biggest whoopsies

58:01.060 --> 58:03.340
was in this order, number two,

58:03.340 --> 58:06.220
their full-throated endorsement of the war in Iraq.

58:06.220 --> 58:08.060
And then number one, when they fucking lied

58:08.060 --> 58:10.220
about Subway's tuna for some reason.

58:10.220 --> 58:11.060
Yeah.

58:11.060 --> 58:11.900
I don't get it.

58:11.900 --> 58:12.740
I don't get it.

58:12.740 --> 58:15.140
Thanks to you so much for listening to our podcast,

58:15.140 --> 58:16.780
which is this one.

58:16.780 --> 58:18.740
My brother, my brother and me.

58:18.740 --> 58:22.300
It's a delight to have you with us as always.

58:22.300 --> 58:23.140
Thank you.

58:23.140 --> 58:25.380
If you pre-ordered the Adventure Zone Crystal Kingdom,

58:25.380 --> 58:26.940
which is a graphic novel we wrote with our daddy

58:26.940 --> 58:29.220
based on our Adventure Zone podcast.

58:29.220 --> 58:30.060
If you haven't gotten it yet,

58:30.060 --> 58:35.060
you can go to theadventurezonecomic.com and buy a copy.

58:35.180 --> 58:36.580
And that would just be the best.

58:36.580 --> 58:38.740
We've also got a lot of new merch

58:38.740 --> 58:40.860
over at mcrorymerch.com.

58:40.860 --> 58:43.020
We got a pin of the month Gooshie Wolves

58:43.020 --> 58:45.980
from the Ethersea setup episodes.

58:45.980 --> 58:48.460
Proceeds from that benefit The Innocence Project,

58:48.460 --> 58:51.180
which exonerates the wrongly convicted through DNA testing

58:51.180 --> 58:53.340
and reforms the criminal justice system

58:53.340 --> 58:55.100
to prevent future injustice.

58:55.100 --> 58:58.060
We've got a really cute, I'm just gonna say,

58:58.060 --> 59:00.900
It's Trash sticker from the My Brother, My Brother and Me

59:00.900 --> 59:01.980
TV show.

59:01.980 --> 59:05.980
A really cool green stoneware mug with the Taz logo on it

59:05.980 --> 59:08.500
and a besties video game club shirt,

59:08.500 --> 59:11.140
which I will be getting as a big fan.

59:11.140 --> 59:12.020
I brought a bunch of,

59:12.020 --> 59:15.660
I bought like 30 of those Justin McElroy's trash stickers

59:15.660 --> 59:18.140
to put on my daughter's homework

59:18.140 --> 59:21.420
when it doesn't cut the mustard.

59:21.420 --> 59:22.260
It's weird that you did that.

59:22.260 --> 59:23.100
I wouldn't.

59:23.100 --> 59:23.920
I'm not a good person.

59:23.920 --> 59:24.760
I don't know what to tell you.

59:24.760 --> 59:26.060
Griffin, tell us about the game.

59:26.060 --> 59:27.500
Oh, you're talking about the Adventure Zone Bureau

59:27.500 --> 59:30.040
balance game that you can play with friends?

59:30.040 --> 59:30.960
Yeah, that one.

59:30.960 --> 59:31.800
That's the one.

59:31.800 --> 59:35.940
Well, 2Gether Studios is the creator on that one,

59:35.940 --> 59:37.660
and they are celebrating a safe return

59:37.660 --> 59:38.620
to the game table this summer

59:38.620 --> 59:41.300
with local retailer events, giveaways, and live streams

59:41.300 --> 59:42.860
of the Bureau of Balance game,

59:42.860 --> 59:46.260
which if you haven't played it is a hoot and a half.

59:46.260 --> 59:49.220
They're gonna have gameplay streams every Tuesday evening

59:49.220 --> 59:54.080
at 8 p.m. Eastern time at twitch.tv slash 2Gether Studios,

59:54.080 --> 59:58.060
and that's T-W-O-Gether Studios.

59:58.060 --> 01:00:01.460
And you can follow 2Gether Studio on Twitter

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.740
for weekly giveaways of swag from them,

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:04.860
and for a second, the publisher

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.940
of our recently released graphic novel,

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:09.140
which please, please get it.

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.820
Along those same lines, I stream on Twitch.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.380
If you ever wanna check that out,

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.700
twitch.tv slash the Travis McElroy.

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:18.280
I've been getting good at Overwatch.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.940
I'd love to see that.

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:22.940
I'm almost ready to do competition level.

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:23.780
Yeah.

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:24.600
Oh, yeah.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.440
I've almost hit 25.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.880
God help us when Travis puts that laser-like focus

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.260
onto a game that has competitive layers to it.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.100
Well, this is what I'm saying.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.660
At this point, boys, I'm getting paid

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:36.540
to play video games in front of people.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.240
I'm a pro gamer.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.080
Yep.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.380
I mean, you're basically a pro gamer.

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.580
Put it on your card.

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.360
Hey, thanks to Montane for the use for our theme song,

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.740
My Life Is Better With You.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.260
I mean, we can't, we're behind the scenes

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:48.200
on this one, folks.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.040
Oh, yeah.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:49.880
We have the scoop.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:50.700
Yeah, we can't.

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.380
It's so rare that we're the one,

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:55.660
that you put up at the curtain and we're also there.

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:56.620
But it's coming.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.200
Hey, do you want the final Yahoo?

01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.260
Yes, please.

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:04.260
This one was sent in by, this one was sent by Nermal

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.940
from the Garfield comics.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:07.780
Nermal?

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.100
Yeah, and thank you, Nermal.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.700
It's not asked by Nermal, though.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:13.700
It's asked by James.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.540
Not Nermal?

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:19.540
Yeah, it's asked by James, who asks,

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:24.740
how many times have you gone to the movie store?

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:27.860
How many times have you been to the movie store

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:32.460
and they didn't have a copy of your favorite movie,

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.580
which was A Walk to Remember with Mandy Moore.

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:38.800
It's your favorite movie.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:39.940
Thanks.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:40.780
Love, James.

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.020
My name's Sheldon.

This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.820
because your dad's got on the lips.

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:58.140
["Better With You by Ken Meanwhile plays in distance.]

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:36.960
