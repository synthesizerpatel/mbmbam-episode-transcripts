00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
Hello, what you are about to hear is a podcast.

00:03.200 --> 00:05.960
And what that means is we're gonna talk into microphones

00:05.960 --> 00:10.960
and then broadcast it on pods, in your iPods.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.200
You're gonna hear this on your iPod.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.680
And so I just wanted to give you an intro

00:16.680 --> 00:19.040
in case you were confused as to what was happening.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.720
Sometimes we'll say pretty silly stuff.

00:21.720 --> 00:26.080
But we're not being wrong.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.720
We're doing a joke to make you laugh.

00:28.720 --> 00:32.800
And also, I wanted to say to my grandpa, Dan,

00:32.800 --> 00:34.640
who I asked to listen to this one.

00:34.640 --> 00:37.360
Well, I'm glad that you figured, I knew you could do it.

00:37.360 --> 00:38.240
Yeah.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.920
I knew you could do it, G-Pod Dan.

00:39.920 --> 00:41.280
I knew you could listen to a podcast.

00:41.280 --> 00:44.280
Downloaded it through Napster and now you're listening to it.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.120
And listen, folks.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.000
Thank you for pirating our podcast, Grandpa Dan.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.580
Just a little prologue.

00:48.580 --> 00:50.880
You're gonna hear us make some pretty obscure references

00:50.880 --> 00:52.360
and you're gonna think, oh, I don't get this

00:52.360 --> 00:53.920
because I'm not a regular listener.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.280
But the truth is you don't get it

00:55.280 --> 00:57.040
because you're not one of the three of us

00:57.040 --> 00:59.000
and sometimes not even then.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.080
Yeah, true.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.400
Sometimes the things we say just isn't funny.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.240
No, listen.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.120
And it's nothing.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.160
We'll be interrupting the show throughout

01:06.160 --> 01:07.720
to try to give you some context,

01:07.720 --> 01:09.560
but we think you're set up now.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.440
What you're gonna hear next is the introduction.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.080
Now, in my brother, my brother and me,

01:13.080 --> 01:14.760
this is our show that we do.

01:14.760 --> 01:18.360
That's where we normally do sort of a slice of life,

01:18.360 --> 01:21.840
skewed view, twisted perspective on current events.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.520
Sometimes we talk about movies for a really long time

01:24.520 --> 01:26.280
and it's unclear even to us

01:26.280 --> 01:29.040
if we're actually excited about them or not.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.560
And sometimes when we struggle to think

01:30.560 --> 01:32.960
of something funny to say, we just cuss a lot.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.000
So please be prepared for that.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.560
That's kind of throughout though.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.360
That's not just an introduction thing.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.960
We're gonna begin now, okay?

01:40.960 --> 01:42.920
But if you get scared at any point,

01:42.920 --> 01:46.240
please, please tell one of us and we will stop.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.240
Just raise your hands.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.740
It's an interactive experience.

01:49.740 --> 01:50.580
Okay, here we go.

01:50.580 --> 01:51.420
You ready?

01:51.420 --> 01:53.920
The McElroy brothers are not experts

01:53.920 --> 01:56.800
and their advice should never be followed.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.160
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

01:59.160 --> 02:02.540
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.880
Also, this show isn't for kids,

02:04.880 --> 02:07.240
which I mentioned only so the babies out there

02:07.240 --> 02:09.360
will know how cool they are for listening.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.960
What's up, you cool baby?

02:10.960 --> 02:12.120
One, two, three, four.

02:12.120 --> 02:16.880
It's the start of something beautiful.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.800
A small acquaintance has blossomed.

02:19.800 --> 02:24.320
It's ripen into a precious friendship.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.480
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.320
Hangs at the skate park, hangs by the beach.

02:30.320 --> 02:37.320
My life, it feels like life.

02:37.320 --> 02:42.120
Oh, it's better, it's better with you.

02:42.120 --> 02:48.120
My life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

02:48.120 --> 02:54.120
This is true, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

02:54.120 --> 03:01.960
My life, oh, it's better with you.

03:01.960 --> 03:02.800
Hello, everybody, and welcome.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.420
Oh, no, wait, no, Justin.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.200
Quieter.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.140
No, why is it quiet?

03:07.140 --> 03:09.680
They can like hot, just because they're new

03:09.680 --> 03:11.960
doesn't mean they don't like it fucking hot.

03:11.960 --> 03:12.800
Oh, that's true.

03:12.800 --> 03:13.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:13.640 --> 03:14.800
Hello, everybody, and welcome.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.160
Wait, this is the music we always play.

03:16.160 --> 03:19.840
Okay, hello, everybody, it was too annoying.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.840
I couldn't even do more than this.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.480
It's so short, every episode.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.400
Hey, everybody, welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

03:24.400 --> 03:26.680
the advice show for the modern era.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.920
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.280
I've always said modern like that.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.520
Yeah, and then I'm gonna say middle-est,

03:32.520 --> 03:34.640
which isn't a real word as far as I know,

03:34.640 --> 03:36.600
but I am the most middle, right?

03:36.600 --> 03:39.120
And I'm, oh, I'm also gonna say like a big dog woof woof,

03:39.120 --> 03:41.720
and that's because every year we brand the year,

03:41.720 --> 03:43.880
and this is 20 Big Dog Run.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.120
What does that mean, you ask?

03:45.120 --> 03:46.160
I don't know.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.760
And I'm your middle-est brother,

03:47.760 --> 03:51.400
Travis Big Dog Woof Woof McElroy.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.680
What's up, shit stains?

03:53.680 --> 03:56.080
Whoa, wait, now hold on.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.320
Griffin has never brought this energy before.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.760
I think Griffin's trying to re-brand.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.400
That's sort of how I come into the beginning of it.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.240
Every episode is very complicated.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.280
It's not, don't lie to them, they don't know the joke.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.800
That is never, you've never done it before.

04:08.800 --> 04:09.880
Is it the voice?

04:09.880 --> 04:11.480
Do you think is it the voice?

04:11.480 --> 04:13.520
You called them shit stains, Griffin.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.080
Hold on, let me try it, let me try again.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.400
What's up, skid marks?

04:16.400 --> 04:18.960
No, well, that's, I mean, better.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.280
That's noticeably better.

04:20.280 --> 04:21.720
It's better.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.840
Not quite, it feels more affectionate,

04:23.840 --> 04:24.840
it has an affectionate energy.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.320
What's up, droopy drawers?

04:26.320 --> 04:30.480
It's Griffin McElroy, the youngest one.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.560
But Griffin, you're usually kind of the sweet one,

04:32.560 --> 04:35.000
and I'm kind of the bad boy in the group.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.920
And I need you to bring some more like sweet energy

04:37.920 --> 04:40.360
so people know that like you're the safe one.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.160
What's up, shit stains?

04:43.160 --> 04:45.480
Okay, just to get some questions out of the way

04:45.480 --> 04:48.720
for new listeners, this is the Max Fun Block Party,

04:48.720 --> 04:51.960
which is where we're trying to onboard new people,

04:51.960 --> 04:53.120
say welcome in.

04:54.480 --> 04:57.440
This show actually doesn't lean on,

04:57.440 --> 04:59.800
people accuse us of doing a lot of in-jokes.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.600
I try to avoid that actually, hilariously.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.200
I try to avoid that in this show.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.760
It just is a lot of non-secret, it's a lot of times.

05:06.760 --> 05:09.120
It feels like in-jokes that you assume like,

05:09.120 --> 05:10.520
oh, people have listened before,

05:10.520 --> 05:11.560
understand what they're talking about.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.760
But as I said earlier, no.

05:13.760 --> 05:18.040
No, no, but we're trying to make, here's the setup, right?

05:18.040 --> 05:22.440
We're actual ass brothers, like real brothers.

05:22.440 --> 05:25.640
Not a joke, we're the McElroys who grew up together.

05:25.640 --> 05:28.720
Our dad's Clint, we do the Adventure Zone together.

05:28.720 --> 05:33.640
And we have done since 2010, April 2010,

05:33.640 --> 05:37.080
we've done an advice program that you are now listening to

05:37.080 --> 05:39.800
and enjoying, we hope, I mean, right now.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.120
So we've been doing it for a long time.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.880
This is our 580th episode.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.960
And the show has evolved,

05:44.960 --> 05:48.560
but not as much as like you would think, right?

05:48.560 --> 05:52.200
It's not like, you know, a general hospital

05:52.200 --> 05:55.360
where 11 years later it would be unrecognizable.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.760
This is still basically the same thing.

05:56.760 --> 06:01.040
It's the same stick, but we're a lot tireder.

06:01.040 --> 06:04.000
That's true, we're older now, we've got kids.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.480
And God knows how many at this point.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.400
And I also know- We have six kids, two each.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.280
You can't do this.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.120
Oh, you're right, you're right.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.080
This is our first year of the show, we have two kids.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.560
We have two kids each, six total.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.680
We share two kids.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.160
We have two kids, it's a timeshare program.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.440
We went in together to buy the kids.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.000
We each get four months.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.640
But, and I know what you're wondering,

06:26.640 --> 06:28.360
I've been listening now to the show for a while

06:28.360 --> 06:30.480
and they haven't given any advice yet.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.320
Anybody get used to that.

06:32.320 --> 06:33.160
That doesn't happen.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.520
Not as much advice these days.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.520
We're not qualified in any way.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.280
And we've also, at this point, as you said,

06:38.280 --> 06:41.160
581 episodes in, basically answered

06:41.160 --> 06:42.880
every problem the world has.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.720
There's nothing new under the sun.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.600
Right, it's just no one listens is the problem.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.440
Yeah.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.280
You know what I mean, no one listens.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.120
No one ever does always say, yeah.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.680
Well, it's because Bob Ball back there in the beginning

06:50.680 --> 06:52.760
is like, don't listen to the brothers.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.800
And it's like, God damn it, Bob Ball.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.760
So, I know you're wondering,

06:57.760 --> 07:01.240
if this is a block party, where is the snacks?

07:01.240 --> 07:02.440
Where are the snacks?

07:02.440 --> 07:05.680
The answer is, you gotta download them.

07:05.680 --> 07:10.280
We are uploading pictures of some amazing snacks.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.920
I made a Jell-O mold.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.680
Yeah, Travis did a Jell-O mold.

07:13.680 --> 07:16.800
I got some pimento pasta salad.

07:16.800 --> 07:17.640
Ooh.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.960
And that's gonna be a beautiful JPEG.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.040
And you're gonna really taste the highlights

07:22.040 --> 07:24.120
and shadows and colors on that one.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.360
So, enjoy that.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.760
We got some bands coming out.

07:26.760 --> 07:29.200
What's up, Blues Traveler coming out

07:29.200 --> 07:31.040
on main stage at 7 p.m. Not him.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.280
Not gonna have, not, it's Blues Traveler,

07:33.280 --> 07:35.840
but without John Popper, because he kind of sucks.

07:35.840 --> 07:39.240
Oh, okay, well then it's a harmonica-free

07:39.240 --> 07:41.320
Blues Traveler experience.

07:41.320 --> 07:44.920
It's just kind of an acoustic, non-harmonica Blues Traveler.

07:44.920 --> 07:47.840
Let me be rad if the Blues Traveler guy one time

07:47.840 --> 07:51.120
forgot his harmonicas, like he left his harmonica vest

07:51.120 --> 07:52.960
in his trunk with all his guns.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.520
And when the concert started, that's when he realized

07:55.520 --> 07:59.360
that he had to make harmonica noises in his mouth.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.400
Let's see if anybody noticed.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.200
Hey, does anybody have any like wax paper

08:03.200 --> 08:04.600
I can put on the comb?

08:04.600 --> 08:05.440
Anybody?

08:06.320 --> 08:07.160
Damn it.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.880
I went to Juilliard.

08:08.880 --> 08:13.080
So, just to kind of start, do you know where

08:13.080 --> 08:14.880
Dracula's setting music?

08:14.880 --> 08:15.720
Where?

08:15.720 --> 08:16.560
Where?

08:16.560 --> 08:17.400
Boo-li-yard.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.240
Oh, God.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.160
Why would it be Dracula and not a ghost?

08:20.160 --> 08:21.840
Dracula doesn't say fucking boo.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.720
The past seven minutes of recording that we have done

08:24.720 --> 08:28.400
have been, not a joke, a pretty good cross-section

08:28.400 --> 08:31.080
of the experience we provide here.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.800
Well, I thought this would be a good opportunity

08:32.800 --> 08:34.680
for people at home to maybe get to know us

08:34.680 --> 08:35.520
on a deeper level.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.360
And Colin sent this in, and this is just kind of

08:38.360 --> 08:40.680
a getting to know you icebreaker question.

08:40.680 --> 08:44.120
The original question here on some kind of web forum was,

08:44.120 --> 08:47.680
what would be the worst torture to you?

08:47.680 --> 08:50.160
And a woman named Laura answered,

08:50.160 --> 08:53.480
you make me live in a cabin in the mountains in winter,

08:53.480 --> 08:57.120
and every Saturday I would have to host a garage sale,

08:57.120 --> 09:01.840
and you would not give me any frozen or fresh vegetables

09:01.840 --> 09:03.280
or fruits to eat.

09:03.280 --> 09:08.280
That is the worst torture Laura can imagine.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.360
So, I want to deposit to us,

09:12.360 --> 09:15.120
what is the worst torture we can imagine?

09:15.120 --> 09:16.680
I'm not gonna go with anything better

09:16.680 --> 09:19.040
than Laura Williams-May, who, by the way,

09:19.040 --> 09:23.280
put in her bio, Laura Williams-May, comma,

09:23.280 --> 09:26.080
I offer alternative explanations and viewpoints.

09:26.080 --> 09:26.920
Indeed.

09:26.920 --> 09:27.760
Good on ya.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.440
And you can tell that because Laura has offered

09:31.440 --> 09:34.960
almost 13,000 answers to questions

09:34.960 --> 09:36.680
on whatever website this is.

09:36.680 --> 09:40.040
They're almost all about how little she wants to be

09:40.040 --> 09:41.920
in a cabin in the mountains in winter

09:41.920 --> 09:44.520
and host a garage sale every Saturday.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.480
Are these, do you think that these are three

09:46.480 --> 09:48.760
like stacking tortures, or like,

09:48.760 --> 09:49.800
you have to live in a cabin?

09:49.800 --> 09:52.520
Oh man, this sucks, but I think I could get used to this.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.360
Well, guess what?

09:54.440 --> 09:56.320
This Saturday, you have to host a garage sale.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.760
Oh man, well, every Saturday.

09:58.760 --> 09:59.600
God damn it.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.920
Well, at least give me some fresh or frozen vegetables

10:01.920 --> 10:04.000
or fruits to eat while I'm hosting the garage sale.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Wait, why are you laughing?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.880
I like that Laura has now,

10:08.880 --> 10:11.520
that's all the vegetables and fruits, Laura.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.120
Frozen or fresh, right?

10:13.120 --> 10:13.960
That's it.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.420
I mean, I guess dried.

10:15.420 --> 10:16.260
Canned.

10:16.260 --> 10:17.080
That's a different kind.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.600
Canned, yeah.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.440
Pickled.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.280
Mushed.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.520
She only likes them frozen or fresh.

10:21.520 --> 10:22.760
Yeah, that's her deal, man.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.720
It's one of the two opposite ends of the spectrum.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.480
Okay, so here's what we do.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.600
We take questions from listeners,

10:28.600 --> 10:31.480
we answer them to the best of our ability.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.520
We're gonna try to get through more than usual,

10:33.520 --> 10:36.600
which is to say more than one, or maybe two.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.440
Let's see how, let's do it.

10:37.440 --> 10:41.520
During lunch, I accidentally dropped a few black beans

10:41.520 --> 10:44.520
and they wrote, by the way, I feel like we never say this,

10:44.520 --> 10:48.520
but if you have a question, you can send it to MBMBAM,

10:49.920 --> 10:51.180
I know what you're thinking.

10:51.180 --> 10:53.900
Wow, a very bad nickname for a podcast.

10:53.900 --> 10:58.900
And yes, you are not wrong, MBMBAM at MaximumFun.org.

11:01.740 --> 11:03.240
Hey, another thing real quick.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.660
Speaking of the bad name of our podcast,

11:05.660 --> 11:08.400
a listener pointed out on the YouTube comments,

11:08.400 --> 11:11.560
cause I was watching our theme song by Montaigne,

11:11.560 --> 11:13.040
cause my kids love it.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.920
They pointed out that my brother, my brother and me

11:14.920 --> 11:19.920
fits exactly with the cadence of the chorus.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.880
My brother, my brother and me.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.600
Yeah, that's fun, that's good stuff.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.720
It's fun.

11:25.720 --> 11:29.200
Anyway, okay, so I accidentally dropped a few black beans

11:29.200 --> 11:31.880
and they rolled under my cubicle into my coworkers

11:31.880 --> 11:32.940
that sit straight across from me.

11:32.940 --> 11:34.960
This is already a nightmare.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.640
And just, oh, for listeners at home, you might be confused.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.760
This didn't happen to Justin.

11:39.760 --> 11:42.560
Justin is reading a question from a listener

11:42.560 --> 11:44.000
and it's written in first person,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.480
but Justin is merely the conduit.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.500
Yeah, sometimes I'll just launch right into him

11:48.500 --> 11:50.040
and you think I'm talking about myself

11:50.040 --> 11:53.520
and then at the end I'm like doofus in Dakota or whatever.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.520
Because you know Justin loves beans.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.080
Right, long time listeners will remember

11:58.080 --> 12:01.040
that Justin exclusively did eat beans for several years.

12:01.040 --> 12:03.040
So I could understand the confusion there.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.200
I used to be a bean boy.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.040
I know.

12:05.040 --> 12:05.860
Now I'm not anymore.

12:05.860 --> 12:06.920
No, now you're a bean man.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.400
Too dense.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.560
I have never met them.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.500
I think they vacuum here on the weekends,

12:13.500 --> 12:15.400
but this happened on Monday.

12:15.400 --> 12:19.420
And by then they will be moldy, it may be so.

12:19.420 --> 12:22.560
Should I go pick up the beans when they are away

12:22.560 --> 12:25.840
and risk being caught in the act and having to explain?

12:25.840 --> 12:28.580
Should I just leave them be?

12:30.240 --> 12:31.600
And leave them be.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.320
There's no way to make this joke land.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.160
Just leave them be.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.000
It's not an audible sort of format, yeah.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.620
And by the way, we'll do the jokes right here, thanks.

12:39.620 --> 12:42.840
This from being there, smell that in Minnesota.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.880
I love, by the way, that in this question,

12:44.880 --> 12:49.880
at no point is go over there while they're there

12:49.920 --> 12:52.160
and explain an option provided.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.560
Hey bro, see if it's a drop some bean beans over here,

12:54.560 --> 12:56.160
gonna clear you out, one sec.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.720
But here's the thing, if you're caught over there

12:58.720 --> 13:02.080
and then you say, I'm over here because I dropped some beans

13:02.080 --> 13:03.900
and they rolled under your cubicle,

13:03.900 --> 13:07.440
that is the most fishy explanation I've ever heard.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.480
Yeah, that's a weird one.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.240
They're definitely gonna think you've accidentally

13:10.240 --> 13:13.160
dropped your stash, like in rent,

13:13.160 --> 13:15.800
and now they are on the case.

13:15.800 --> 13:16.640
Here's what I'm gonna say.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.600
But if you say, if you go over there and say like,

13:18.600 --> 13:20.320
I dropped some beans and they rolled under,

13:20.320 --> 13:23.640
sorry about that, that's so wild that there's no way

13:23.640 --> 13:25.360
they're gonna think you're lying, right?

13:25.360 --> 13:26.320
That's a good point.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.160
Okay.

13:28.360 --> 13:31.920
I'm gonna say, it's just a couple beans.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.320
It's just a couple beans. That's what fucking

13:33.320 --> 13:35.900
Jack and the Beanstalk thought, Griffin.

13:35.900 --> 13:38.680
Just a couple beans, and then pretty soon,

13:38.680 --> 13:42.320
a giant falls and levels half the city.

13:42.320 --> 13:46.320
But Jack didn't roll the beans accidentally.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.800
Like Jack's mom was like, get these fucking beans

13:48.800 --> 13:50.040
out of here, yeet!

13:50.040 --> 13:51.920
And then a big Beanstalk came out,

13:51.920 --> 13:54.120
and then we all know the rest of that story.

13:55.220 --> 13:57.200
Everybody got squished and died from it.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.280
But I would like to, just a side note,

13:59.280 --> 14:03.480
I know this is pretty, some Monday morning quarterbacking

14:03.480 --> 14:05.280
on the author of Jack and the Beanstalk.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.700
When the mysterious stranger said,

14:07.700 --> 14:10.760
trade me your cow for these magic beans,

14:10.760 --> 14:14.720
wouldn't anybody, no matter what level of curiosity

14:14.720 --> 14:18.200
they have, anybody would say, in what way are they magic?

14:18.200 --> 14:21.560
Yeah, what kind of spell do they contain?

14:21.560 --> 14:25.200
Like, it's not like magic bean is like a category of bean.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.960
They're like, oh, these are some of those magic beans

14:26.960 --> 14:27.800
I've heard.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.360
Because if the mysterious stranger was like,

14:29.360 --> 14:33.800
oh, it'll grow a giant Beanstalk that you'll have to climb?

14:33.800 --> 14:37.640
And then hide from a man-eating giant.

14:37.640 --> 14:38.880
How did I get them, you ask?

14:38.880 --> 14:39.920
Don't worry about that.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.600
Give me your cow.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.620
Give me that cow right now.

14:42.620 --> 14:47.120
Anyway, if I was in the cubicle across from this person

14:47.120 --> 14:49.400
and I came over like, hey, a couple beans those

14:49.400 --> 14:51.120
did roll under, and I looked down there,

14:51.120 --> 14:53.880
I would be like, oh, it's fine, it's just a couple beans.

14:53.880 --> 14:57.960
If it was 50 beans, and I looked under my desk

14:57.960 --> 15:00.840
and there was a small pile of beans under there,

15:00.840 --> 15:04.360
I would be like, yeah, you should get those.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.440
You need to clean those up.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.760
This is where I work.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.040
I think about this a lot, right?

15:08.040 --> 15:09.440
You do?

15:09.440 --> 15:14.280
Well, no, it's just this idea of like, one is nothing.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.000
And a million is a huge thing.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.600
So there's some number, there's a fixed number, right?

15:21.600 --> 15:23.800
Like if one bean is on the floor,

15:23.800 --> 15:25.320
you probably wouldn't even notice.

15:25.320 --> 15:28.360
If a hundred beans are in a small pyramid,

15:28.360 --> 15:31.960
arranged perfectly, like sitting in your cubicle,

15:31.960 --> 15:33.040
that's a huge deal.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.000
That's a massive deal.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.680
So there's some number in between one and 100 beans

15:37.680 --> 15:39.600
where it becomes a topic,

15:39.600 --> 15:41.520
where it becomes something that needs dealt with.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.560
I think I've got it.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.840
I think I know the number.

15:43.840 --> 15:44.680
Oh, really?

15:44.680 --> 15:45.520
You know the number?

15:45.520 --> 15:46.400
I absolutely know the number.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.360
I think it's five beans.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.600
Okay, okay, wait, we'll shush that.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.640
Shush, shush.

15:53.640 --> 15:54.880
If I look under my desk and there's-

15:54.880 --> 15:55.720
It's your thesis.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.600
If there's one bean under my desk, oh, that's fun.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.600
Two beans, oh, there's a couple beans down here.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.160
Three beans, that's a few beans.

16:01.160 --> 16:04.520
Four beans is like, should I do something about this?

16:05.400 --> 16:06.440
Nah, it's just four beans.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.840
Five beans is insane.

16:08.840 --> 16:12.520
That's way too many beans to have under your desk.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.600
I don't think it's a binary, right?

16:14.600 --> 16:19.080
Because I actually think a singular bean in the wild,

16:19.080 --> 16:22.680
if I saw just a black bean under my desk,

16:22.680 --> 16:26.520
how the fuck did one bean get there?

16:26.520 --> 16:29.880
Okay, so there's like a feature, not a bug,

16:29.880 --> 16:32.240
a feature of the human experience,

16:32.240 --> 16:34.560
where it's like if something's small

16:34.560 --> 16:36.920
and you maybe don't necessarily wanna think about it

16:36.920 --> 16:40.280
that much, you could filter out a bean.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.960
You could be like, I don't know,

16:42.960 --> 16:46.280
my awareness is not going to engage with that one bean.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.440
I can't deal with that.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.360
Aw, man, it must be nice not having ADHD, but go on.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.280
I see that bean, it's my whole day.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.720
What the fuck is that bean doing here?

16:56.720 --> 16:58.640
I'm on the hunt.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.960
So that's one of our many bean questions we do.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.080
We like to open things up with a bean segment.

17:04.080 --> 17:06.800
Yeah, and now there's another segment here

17:06.800 --> 17:08.920
that I would say is much beloved

17:08.920 --> 17:11.560
and everyone loves it when I do it.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.720
And I'll pull you aside, folks.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.520
This next is gonna be a little bit loud,

17:15.520 --> 17:17.800
but riddle me piss, boys.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.600
And now let me pull you aside real quick

17:19.600 --> 17:21.800
to say that we don't like this.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.760
Well, there are some folks out there that do.

17:24.760 --> 17:27.920
Yeah, that's important context, but that we don't like it.

17:27.920 --> 17:31.040
I'll give you guys, new listeners, a little explanation.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.760
So there are people who will submit riddles

17:33.760 --> 17:34.600
to the internet.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.160
And every time they put that riddle up,

17:36.160 --> 17:38.960
they think this is an absolute slam dunk.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.320
But actually, as you will see from this riddle,

17:41.320 --> 17:42.160
this is not the case.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.240
So this was submitted by- You probably don't need

17:43.240 --> 17:44.080
to explain that.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.000
I think people are gonna get

17:45.000 --> 17:47.040
that the riddles aren't very good.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.360
This is submitted by Kayla.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.800
Thank you, Kayla.

17:49.800 --> 17:54.520
If all Wibbles are Kriggles, all Borkens are Kwamblings.

17:54.520 --> 17:59.520
What? I already, I already don't want it.

17:59.520 --> 18:04.520
If all Wibbles are Kriggles, all Borkens are Kwamblings,

18:05.800 --> 18:08.720
excuse me, no Hoggles are Borkens,

18:08.720 --> 18:11.200
and all Kriggles are Borkens,

18:11.200 --> 18:14.280
is it true that all Borkens are Kriggles?

18:14.280 --> 18:15.520
This sucks.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.680
It sucks, Travis.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.320
Do you wanna hear it again?

18:18.320 --> 18:19.160
No, absolutely not.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.000
I don't wanna hear it, got it, got it, got it.

18:20.000 --> 18:20.820
I just wanna hear the-

18:20.820 --> 18:25.080
If all Wibbles are Kriggles, all Borkens are Kwamblings,

18:25.080 --> 18:29.600
no Hoggles are Borkens, and all Kriggles are Borkens,

18:29.600 --> 18:32.240
is it true that all Borkens are Kriggles?

18:32.240 --> 18:34.800
I can't, I try, actually, you know what's funny?

18:34.800 --> 18:37.920
I tried to make my brain engage with it that time,

18:37.920 --> 18:38.920
and it could, and it-

18:38.920 --> 18:40.680
Slides right off, doesn't it?

18:40.680 --> 18:42.560
It just slides, it just bounced out.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.420
It couldn't do it.

18:44.420 --> 18:46.120
So what was it, was it, no?

18:46.120 --> 18:48.640
Is, Juice, you say yes, I'll say no.

18:48.640 --> 18:49.520
So that's- Okay, yes.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.340
No.

18:50.340 --> 18:51.240
Griffin's right.

18:51.240 --> 18:54.440
The answer, what they've actually written here is nope.

18:54.440 --> 18:57.720
So there you go, Borkens aren't Kriggles.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.560
Borkens aren't Kriggles.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.600
I guess what I'd say is Borkens aren't Kriggles.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.440
Yep.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.680
That's fantastic.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.040
Jesus.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.740
We used to do Yahoo Answers on this show,

19:06.740 --> 19:11.360
but then that website got suffocated, killed,

19:11.360 --> 19:14.300
got shut down and deleted off the internet.

19:14.300 --> 19:19.300
So this is a nascent segment, I would say, fresh.

19:20.300 --> 19:22.620
And it's very exciting where we approach

19:22.620 --> 19:24.560
the Wizard of the Cloud and we look

19:24.560 --> 19:26.680
at questions on WikiHow instead.

19:26.680 --> 19:30.600
And we learn things instead of, when Yahoo Answers,

19:30.600 --> 19:33.560
it was just, you know, mystery atop a mystery.

19:33.560 --> 19:37.060
WikiHow is like a teacher.

19:37.060 --> 19:39.400
It's like a teacher that comes to teach you things.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.000
And today's WikiHow is in-

19:41.000 --> 19:43.280
Kind of like Nanny McPhee when you think about it.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.720
It's basically Nanny McPhee.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.860
Yeah, it's like Nanny McPhee, it teaches you lessons

19:46.860 --> 19:48.960
that maybe you don't even realize you're learning.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.600
It's like Dr. Parnassus.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.440
Just like Dr. Parnassus.

19:52.440 --> 19:55.880
And Mr. Magorium, which I haven't seen, but okay.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.020
This is a subject that has near and dear to,

19:59.020 --> 20:01.440
I think, all our hearts, and it's how to mosh in a mosh pit.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.280
Thank you.

20:02.280 --> 20:07.040
I've always been curious about the level of violence

20:07.040 --> 20:11.240
that you are supposed to bring to that sort of encounter.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.280
Yeah, I've always been worried I'll get in there

20:13.280 --> 20:15.300
and fling myself at like a 10,

20:15.300 --> 20:16.840
and then they'll be like, whoa, dude.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.720
Whoa, dude, fucking stop.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.800
We're on like a three.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.920
Fucking Slipknot on stage is like,

20:22.920 --> 20:24.960
stop, stop the rock music.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.520
Look at, that guy did a big hit.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.480
Get the fuck out of here.

20:28.480 --> 20:31.740
Hey, this is a shared experience.

20:31.740 --> 20:32.580
Yeah.

20:32.580 --> 20:34.640
Mosh like that at home.

20:34.640 --> 20:38.640
The first few things are preparatory, preparatory.

20:38.640 --> 20:39.480
What?

20:39.480 --> 20:40.540
Preparatory?

20:40.540 --> 20:41.380
Proprietary.

20:41.380 --> 20:42.720
Proprietary.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.160
Griffin invented them just for this.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.000
Step one.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.280
These are patented.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.520
Wear clothes you don't care about getting ruined.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.360
Wear old worn clothes or a cheap outfit

20:53.360 --> 20:54.180
you don't feel attached to.

20:54.180 --> 20:59.180
Clothing can get easily ripped or stained in a mosh pit.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.240
Spelled how?

21:00.240 --> 21:01.080
Spelled how?

21:01.080 --> 21:03.760
What if I wear my stained T-shirt?

21:03.760 --> 21:04.600
There you go.

21:04.600 --> 21:08.240
Yeah, that's a very, it's a risk that you can.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.080
What's stained?

21:09.080 --> 21:09.920
I mean, it's a bummer.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.920
It must be a bummer to go to a stained show

21:12.920 --> 21:14.520
from the band Stained,

21:14.520 --> 21:17.840
and then later you go to Wienerschnitzel

21:17.840 --> 21:19.480
and you're having yourself a nice hot dog.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.320
Yeah.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.800
And then you layer it up with all your favorite topics.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.560
Your moose stars, your cats ups.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.400
Everyone be quiet.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.240
Okay.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.600
And then you first fight, I got this.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.360
Your first fight, catch your mustard,

21:30.360 --> 21:32.080
squirts out onto your shirt.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.520
And you look down at your new stained T-shirt

21:34.520 --> 21:36.000
that you bought at the concert earlier,

21:36.000 --> 21:40.400
and you think, I can never express this to other people.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.120
I'll never be able to express this situation.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.840
Hey, what happened to that new show shirt you bought?

21:44.840 --> 21:46.280
The language hasn't evolved enough.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.160
Yeah, it's stained.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.000
Oh, I know.

21:48.000 --> 21:48.920
Yeah, I was with you.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.440
No, no, no.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.640
It also said that the very next step

21:52.640 --> 21:55.320
is actually don't bring big bottles of mustard

21:55.320 --> 21:56.520
into the mosh pit.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.360
That's fair.

21:57.360 --> 21:58.200
That's rude.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.320
Hey, as someone who grew up listening to music

22:01.320 --> 22:02.400
in the 90s and stuff,

22:02.400 --> 22:04.560
is Stained one of those bands that was like,

22:04.560 --> 22:06.160
sounded like really hardcore,

22:06.160 --> 22:08.240
but was actually secretly a Christian rock band?

22:08.240 --> 22:09.960
Christian, I don't know.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.480
I think Puddle of Mud is.

22:11.480 --> 22:12.480
I don't know.

22:12.480 --> 22:13.320
That feels right.

22:13.320 --> 22:15.200
All right, wear contact lenses instead of glasses.

22:15.200 --> 22:19.440
Ovs, avoid wearing loose jewelry or accessories.

22:19.440 --> 22:22.120
Partially, I think because you don't want to get choked,

22:22.120 --> 22:25.400
but also because of mosh bandits.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.960
And we know.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.600
Mosh mime women.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.800
And I don't want to point fingers,

22:30.800 --> 22:33.440
but I do remember one time Justin went to a rock concert

22:33.440 --> 22:35.280
and came back with a beeper that wasn't his.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.400
You want to talk about that?

22:37.400 --> 22:38.720
Oh my God, what?

22:38.720 --> 22:39.560
Do you not remember that?

22:39.560 --> 22:40.480
I don't remember this.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.800
No, tell me more.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.200
You went to a concert and you said you brought,

22:44.200 --> 22:45.840
maybe this was a lie you told your brother.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.800
Maybe you bought a beeper and you were embarrassed about it,

22:47.800 --> 22:50.720
but you said you found a beeper on the floor

22:50.720 --> 22:52.560
at a rock concert after a mosh pit

22:52.560 --> 22:55.560
and you brought it on home, which is fantastic.

22:55.560 --> 22:59.040
I know that one time I traded in enough Pepsi points

22:59.040 --> 23:00.360
to get a Mountain Dew beeper.

23:00.360 --> 23:01.200
Yes, that's it.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.040
You did do that.

23:02.040 --> 23:02.880
That wasn't it.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.720
I think this is a different situation though,

23:04.720 --> 23:05.560
it sounds like.

23:05.560 --> 23:06.400
Okay, this seems like the kind of thing you would.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.280
I don't remember this.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.120
Oh my gosh.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.320
Make sure your shoes are tied.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.160
Fantastic.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.000
Yes.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.240
All right, wait for the mosh.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.280
This is joining the mosh pit.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.280
This is where we,

23:14.280 --> 23:17.080
this is where the fucking rubber hits the road.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.800
Wait for the mosh pit to open up.

23:18.800 --> 23:19.640
Yeah.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.520
You'll know it's getting ready to start.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.440
Will there be a signal or?

23:24.440 --> 23:25.960
Well, Travis, you'll know it's getting ready to start

23:25.960 --> 23:28.240
when the performer announces it or other concert goers

23:28.240 --> 23:29.920
begin to make a clearing near the stage.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.560
Probably not the first one.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.160
Okay, everyone.

23:33.160 --> 23:34.600
Okay, everyone.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.040
On three?

23:36.040 --> 23:37.880
It's me, Jeremy Slipknot.

23:37.880 --> 23:41.240
And I'm, I've got the red flag here.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.160
Wave, wave, begin.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.800
Begin the shoving.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.120
There is a flaw with the second one though,

23:48.120 --> 23:49.920
which is if you're waiting for other people

23:49.920 --> 23:51.680
to start the moshing,

23:51.680 --> 23:53.480
then what if everybody's waiting?

23:53.480 --> 23:55.520
You could be a mosh pioneer.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.160
Right, yeah.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.160
Finish your drink.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.840
Don't bring a drink, duh.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.760
Enter the mosh pit once you're ready.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.880
Yeah, don't be surprised if people are pushing you

24:03.880 --> 24:06.760
and bumping you as you get to the edge of the circle.

24:06.760 --> 24:08.240
If you don't wanna dive right into the mosh pit,

24:08.240 --> 24:09.720
stay at the edge of the pit for a little bit

24:09.720 --> 24:11.640
and observe until you feel ready to enter.

24:11.640 --> 24:13.440
What's the number of people

24:13.440 --> 24:16.400
standing on the perimeter of the mosh pit

24:16.400 --> 24:19.160
staring intently at the people moshing

24:19.160 --> 24:21.080
that makes the people moshing feel uncomfortable?

24:21.080 --> 24:22.840
Like at what level do you,

24:22.840 --> 24:24.800
even though you're jumping and feeling the vibe

24:24.800 --> 24:27.200
of the music and hurting and pushing

24:27.200 --> 24:29.040
and shoving and hurting other people,

24:29.040 --> 24:30.880
are you like, I can't ignore the fact

24:30.880 --> 24:34.640
that there are just like a dozen people looking at me.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.720
Well, I think much like the bean question

24:36.720 --> 24:37.560
we can start with,

24:37.560 --> 24:39.240
if it's just two people moshing,

24:39.240 --> 24:42.000
that's a romantic or at least very intense,

24:42.000 --> 24:42.840
emotional experience. What is the sound

24:42.840 --> 24:43.680
of two people moshing?

24:43.680 --> 24:47.160
That's like a wedding's first dance there, right?

24:47.160 --> 24:49.920
You don't wanna, when two people are moshing together,

24:49.920 --> 24:52.560
you don't wanna interrupt what they've got going.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.840
Now, as soon as a third party enters, right,

24:54.840 --> 24:56.920
now the energy I think is spread out as such

24:56.920 --> 24:59.800
that you need a fourth person to balance out

24:59.800 --> 25:01.840
or else inevitably two of the three

25:01.840 --> 25:03.480
are gonna start moshing together

25:03.480 --> 25:04.960
while the third is excluded.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.600
Oh, God. Yeah.

25:06.600 --> 25:10.240
You need to share the load with four,

25:10.240 --> 25:12.920
at which point then it just is gonna escalate from there.

25:12.920 --> 25:15.400
That's gonna snowball for sure.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.480
So yeah, start moshing, jump up and down in place,

25:17.480 --> 25:18.800
make a lap around the pit,

25:18.800 --> 25:20.120
have both your hands open

25:20.120 --> 25:22.240
and your arms up at about chest level.

25:22.240 --> 25:25.360
That's a cool look, that's probably not true.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.840
Gently push people or bump into them.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.000
It's okay to push people around,

25:28.000 --> 25:29.200
everyone's in the pit expecting it,

25:29.200 --> 25:31.280
but remember, you're not there to hurt anyone.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.080
Avoid elbowing anyone in the chest.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.960
As for some people, that can be quite sensitive,

25:35.960 --> 25:36.880
if not painful.

25:36.880 --> 25:37.840
I would say most people.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.440
Yeah, unless it's like fucking Colossus.

25:40.440 --> 25:42.160
Most people getting elbowed in the chest

25:42.160 --> 25:43.160
is gonna feel that.

25:43.160 --> 25:44.640
Not gonna feel good.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.920
Keep with the pace of the music and those around you.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.520
Cool off with a breather during slow songs.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.360
Oh, yeah.

25:50.360 --> 25:52.160
One of Stain's slow songs.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.240
And be prepared for- One of their ballads.

25:54.240 --> 25:55.640
Be prepared for everyone to start moshing harder

25:55.640 --> 25:56.640
once the music picks up again.

25:56.640 --> 25:57.560
Okay, cool.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.800
This is, I know you're thinking,

25:59.800 --> 26:01.600
I'm definitely gonna hurt somebody.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.000
Like somebody's going to get hurt here.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.160
Not if you follow mosh pit etiquette, the next segment.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.240
One, stop and help anyone up should they fall.

26:07.240 --> 26:08.080
Yes.

26:08.080 --> 26:11.360
That's true in life as it is in mosh.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.840
Yeah, if you see anyone fall down

26:13.840 --> 26:15.360
and you're close to them,

26:15.360 --> 26:17.840
it's a good thing to do in general,

26:17.840 --> 26:22.840
regardless of whether or not a bunch of sweaty butt rock fans

26:23.720 --> 26:25.360
are out there jumping down nearby.

26:25.360 --> 26:27.280
It does become especially important

26:27.280 --> 26:28.640
when that is happening.

26:28.640 --> 26:29.480
Yeah.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.760
Pick up dropped items and hold them above your head.

26:31.760 --> 26:32.880
Is this anyone's beeper?

26:32.880 --> 26:33.720
Nope.

26:33.720 --> 26:34.560
Bye.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.560
I don't know how to transfer service on a beeper.

26:38.560 --> 26:41.040
So I guess I'll be answering Doug's pages.

26:41.040 --> 26:43.000
That was the biggest mystery to me.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.680
If you see anyone's shoe or cell phone on the ground,

26:45.680 --> 26:46.520
stop and pick it up.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.040
The image that WikiHouse provided,

26:48.040 --> 26:51.040
which if you've never been to the website is always good,

26:51.040 --> 26:53.800
is somebody very happily holding a shoe above their head.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.600
And I like to think like, I'd get into the music, right?

26:56.600 --> 26:57.440
You all know me.

26:57.440 --> 26:58.880
I like to ride those vibes.

26:58.880 --> 27:03.000
But if my shoe comes off, that's priority number one.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.200
At the very least, it's gonna create a physical imbalance

27:06.200 --> 27:07.040
in your body.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.080
You're gonna notice.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.360
Yes.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.080
Don't throw things in the mosh pit.

27:11.080 --> 27:11.920
Yes.

27:11.920 --> 27:12.760
Thank you.

27:12.760 --> 27:13.600
That's good.

27:13.600 --> 27:14.440
Or the sand pit.

27:14.440 --> 27:16.720
And don't try to mosh with people who aren't in the pit.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.160
Get in here.

27:18.160 --> 27:21.200
Yeah, don't try to start an ancillary mosh pit.

27:21.200 --> 27:24.440
That's a weird, that is a weird sort of state of mind

27:24.440 --> 27:28.240
for the person who's like, I'm the edge of the mosh pit.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.200
This mosh, no mosher.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.440
I hate this mosh pit.

27:32.440 --> 27:33.280
I hate this mosh pit.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.640
I'm standing guard of you.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.760
I won't let this, I won't let you pass.

27:36.760 --> 27:38.080
See, I thought that this was saying,

27:38.080 --> 27:40.280
don't try to start a secondary mosh pit

27:40.280 --> 27:42.640
at a different location in the audience.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.040
Like you're like, you know what?

27:44.040 --> 27:46.200
I don't like that mosh pit anymore.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.880
They observe rules I don't like.

27:47.880 --> 27:48.920
I lost my shoe in there.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.240
No one held it above their head.

27:50.240 --> 27:53.880
Hey, you, you're a beefy person.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.120
Come mosh with me.

27:55.120 --> 27:55.960
You're on my team.

27:55.960 --> 27:56.800
What?

27:56.800 --> 27:59.680
We're a rival mosh.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.040
I just really wanna watch the show.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.640
Begin jumping, we're a team now.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.960
Squid game, hurt them.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.280
Sick of them.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.240
Stank ironically.

28:08.240 --> 28:10.800
Everyone, stank ironically.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.280
Don't bother the venue staff in the pit.

28:13.280 --> 28:16.240
Oh man, you're shoving too hard.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.200
Okay, I'll stop.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.080
That's what they're there for.

28:19.080 --> 28:21.200
They're there to be, you know, in charge.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.240
They're the parent of the mosh pit.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.040
You need to, hey, they're not doing it

28:25.040 --> 28:26.800
because they're mad at you.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.560
They're doing it because they care about you.

28:29.560 --> 28:33.840
Yeah, I gotta say, that's the last sort of tip here.

28:33.840 --> 28:36.620
If I'm like in it, if I'm like,

28:37.520 --> 28:39.920
if I'm skanking it to Hoobastank

28:39.920 --> 28:44.920
and really riding the vibe and doing a lot of pushing

28:45.280 --> 28:47.760
and someone tells me, hey, you need to stop.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.160
I don't know that that sort of like,

28:51.400 --> 28:56.400
you know, primitive, just in my soul instinct to mosh

28:56.640 --> 28:59.120
is going to be able to be contained at that point.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.640
Oh, that's so interesting, Griffin,

29:00.640 --> 29:02.680
because if I was moshing at a concert

29:02.680 --> 29:04.440
and someone told me you need to stop,

29:04.440 --> 29:07.660
I would assume it was my inner monologue saying like,

29:07.660 --> 29:08.500
this is done now.

29:08.500 --> 29:11.440
This is not your thing, Travis.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.560
Hey, Travis, I think you and I can both agree

29:13.560 --> 29:14.760
you're forcing this.

29:15.640 --> 29:17.880
The venue staff should not be there

29:17.880 --> 29:21.120
to police the intensity of people's moshing.

29:21.120 --> 29:23.920
They should be there for folks like me

29:23.920 --> 29:26.160
who they see me like very nervously start

29:26.160 --> 29:30.560
walking in and they just grab me by the scruff of my neck

29:30.560 --> 29:33.480
like no friend, no friend, this is not for you.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.120
We actually have seating over here,

29:35.120 --> 29:37.400
secret seating that we didn't tell anyone about,

29:37.400 --> 29:40.800
but it looks like your human body might need it.

29:40.800 --> 29:41.640
Yeah.

29:41.640 --> 29:44.440
Hey, why don't you go buy a t-shirt, huh?

29:44.440 --> 29:48.100
A nice t-shirt and then maybe head on home.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.380
This is a funny joke that somebody asking the questions,

29:52.380 --> 29:53.800
the community Q and A, what do I do

29:53.800 --> 29:55.440
if somebody starts doing the Macarena

29:55.440 --> 29:57.360
whilst in the pit, goopity-goop?

29:57.360 --> 30:02.040
The community answered, nobody would do the Macarena

30:02.040 --> 30:03.280
in the mosh pit.

30:03.280 --> 30:06.160
Only moshing is done in a mosh pit.

30:06.160 --> 30:08.480
What if the person does what I used to do

30:08.480 --> 30:09.440
at middle school dances,

30:09.440 --> 30:10.640
which is they're too awkward to dance

30:10.640 --> 30:12.160
so they just kind of sing along to the song

30:12.160 --> 30:13.840
in the middle of the dance floor.

30:13.840 --> 30:14.680
Yeah.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.840
What if someone tries to make a big holding hand circle

30:17.840 --> 30:18.680
in the mosh pit?

30:18.680 --> 30:20.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.120
What if they try to do that like,

30:22.120 --> 30:24.840
and now we're gonna highlight individual moshers.

30:24.840 --> 30:26.120
We've created a mosh circle.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.640
Now you get in there and let us watch you mosh by yourself.

30:28.640 --> 30:29.660
Mosh train.

30:29.660 --> 30:31.200
Yes.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.400
I'm into that.

30:32.400 --> 30:34.440
Anyway, now we all know how to do this.

30:34.440 --> 30:38.040
So let's all go to a rock concert together.

30:38.040 --> 30:38.880
Yeah.

30:40.680 --> 30:41.680
Man, that'd be fun.

30:41.680 --> 30:42.760
That would be fucking fun.

30:42.760 --> 30:43.600
I'd like that.

30:43.600 --> 30:44.440
I'd love to man.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.280
What's stopping us?

30:46.480 --> 30:47.320
Well.

30:47.320 --> 30:48.160
A lot of stuff.

30:48.160 --> 30:49.200
Where to begin?

30:49.200 --> 30:50.680
What do you mean, where to begin?

30:50.680 --> 30:52.440
Our bodies.

30:52.440 --> 30:56.520
Oh, this is actually good to talk about.

30:56.520 --> 30:59.240
We stop in the middle,

30:59.240 --> 31:00.920
like just when you're really starting to have fun.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.380
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:02.380 --> 31:03.640
I don't know what you're thinking.

31:03.640 --> 31:04.520
This is an advice show.

31:04.520 --> 31:05.680
They've done very little advice.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.600
Well, we're hanging there.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.080
There's a lot more coming.

31:10.080 --> 31:11.560
I just around the bend.

31:11.560 --> 31:13.840
We take a break to do advertisements.

31:13.840 --> 31:16.680
And what is great is if you can like frequent the businesses

31:16.680 --> 31:17.520
that we talked about.

31:17.520 --> 31:19.200
And we make it funny.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.800
We're not like some of those other advertisers.

31:21.800 --> 31:22.640
Don't skip them.

31:22.640 --> 31:23.840
It's not a robot or something.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.080
It's really the guys that you love already.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.600
And we're kind of like the Geico cavemen

31:28.600 --> 31:29.640
of podcast commercials.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.640
We're like, fuck, that's funny.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.480
Cool.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.520
That's funny, yeah.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.360
Cool.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.120
So, oh, I begin this by I say,

31:37.120 --> 31:39.080
let's, I'll go to the money then.

31:39.080 --> 31:42.080
It's better, it's better with you.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.280
Stamps.

31:48.280 --> 31:51.840
So for those of you at home, stamps are a thing

31:51.840 --> 31:52.760
that you have to like.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.280
And they know about stamps.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.280
How do you know that?

31:56.280 --> 31:58.480
Well, we have to assume a base level of confidence.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.000
Okay, fair, fair, fair.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.560
So if you've got a small business

32:01.560 --> 32:05.080
and you know there's nothing more available than your time,

32:05.080 --> 32:07.520
so stop wasting on trips to the post office

32:07.520 --> 32:10.600
and start wasting it on listening to our podcast.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.600
Stamps.com makes it easy to mail

32:12.600 --> 32:14.720

32:23.800 --> 32:25.400
They will, I, now.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.520
They will do it.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.320
Now that I have committed them to it,

32:28.320 --> 32:31.320
they're working on a media player as we speak.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.160
So whether you're saying-

32:32.160 --> 32:34.360
They are trying to Tron Ben Gibbard today.

32:36.840 --> 32:40.200
That's our Stamps.com guarantee to you.

32:40.200 --> 32:43.000
We are going to blast Ben Gibbard with a Tron gun.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Guys, stop it.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
I said I would-

32:45.000 --> 32:47.040
If you've ever wanted your computer

32:47.040 --> 32:48.880
to describe your girlfriend dying,

32:48.880 --> 32:50.920
now the chance is here.

32:50.920 --> 32:51.760
It will happen.

32:51.760 --> 32:52.680
Do you have an old mattress?

32:52.680 --> 32:54.240
Now the world is 2021.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.960
This disc on your back, yes, it's vinyl.

32:56.960 --> 32:57.800
You've guessed it.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.200
Whether you're an office sending invoices,

32:59.200 --> 33:00.520
a side hustle Etsy shop,

33:19.480 --> 33:20.800

33:20.800 --> 33:24.600
And with my promo code, my brother, all one word,

33:24.600 --> 33:25.440
you get a- Our-

33:25.440 --> 33:27.080
My promo code.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.480
I called Stamps.com and I said,

33:28.480 --> 33:30.640
can I please have a promo code?

33:30.640 --> 33:31.880
And they said, yes, Travis,

33:31.880 --> 33:34.000
but don't let your brothers use it.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.280
We should make an advertisement that's cool

33:38.280 --> 33:40.200
generate us three promo codes

33:40.200 --> 33:42.440
to see which- Oh, oh, I like that.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.400
We can't come up with that up.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.200
My brother, all one word,

33:46.200 --> 33:48.240
you get a special offer that includes a four week trial,

33:48.240 --> 33:50.640
plus free postage and a digital scale.

33:50.640 --> 33:52.680
No long-term commitments or contracts.

33:52.680 --> 33:53.520
Now I know you're wondering,

33:53.520 --> 33:54.760
sometimes that can be confusing.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.440
The digital scale means it has like a digital readout,

33:57.440 --> 34:02.040
not that it's like a computerized, like 3D scale.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.000
I just wanna make sure that it's clear.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.680
It's not made of lasers or something.

34:04.680 --> 34:06.080
So- Right, I think, yeah.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.200
Okay, you don't know that.

34:07.200 --> 34:08.320
It confuses me.

34:08.320 --> 34:10.400
Just go to stamps.com, click on the microphone

34:10.400 --> 34:12.480
at the top of the homepage and type in my brother,

34:12.480 --> 34:13.320
all one word.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.680
That's stamps.com, promo code, my brother.

34:15.680 --> 34:19.040
Stamps.com, never go to the post office again.

34:20.200 --> 34:21.360
Unless you work there.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.640
Unless you- Yeah.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.880
Oh, can you imagine if you worked at the post office

34:25.880 --> 34:28.280
and the post office found out you had a stamps.com account?

34:28.280 --> 34:29.760
Oh boy.

34:29.760 --> 34:32.840
I think it would go a little something like this.

34:32.840 --> 34:34.880
Hey Derek, you got a stamps.com account?

34:34.880 --> 34:35.840
Uh, yeah.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.440
Ah, cool, can you sort those packages please?

34:38.440 --> 34:40.760
He actually did the skit.

34:40.760 --> 34:43.160
Yeah, that's a good skit.

34:43.160 --> 34:44.640
Let me talk about this next one.

34:44.640 --> 34:46.200
Okay.

34:46.200 --> 34:47.040
It's ZipRecruiter.

34:47.040 --> 34:47.880
Oh, okay.

34:47.880 --> 34:52.120
You know, I like to hand select things in my life.

34:52.120 --> 34:52.960
Like what?

34:52.960 --> 34:55.560
No, like every day when I go into my,

34:57.720 --> 35:00.000
you know, toothpaste closet

35:00.000 --> 35:01.280
and I pick the paste of the day.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:02.120 --> 35:03.200
And what am I feeling like?

35:03.200 --> 35:05.440
Baking soda, I'm baking soda peroxide, whatever.

35:05.440 --> 35:06.600
Do you like the ones with the stripes?

35:06.600 --> 35:07.880
I need the whitening.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.720
Yeah, I like the ones with the stripes sometimes

35:09.720 --> 35:11.400
if I feel a little bit saucy.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.480
But that's me, you know what I mean?

35:13.480 --> 35:16.080
I like to choose, it says in the ad copy,

35:16.080 --> 35:17.800
it says I can choose my own, so I guess I did.

35:17.800 --> 35:18.920
Yeah, sure.

35:18.920 --> 35:20.800
Yeah, don't let me off the leash again.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.840
ZipRecruiter, that's what you get.

35:22.840 --> 35:25.440
You can do the same thing I do for toothpaste,

35:25.440 --> 35:26.680
you can do it for hiring though.

35:26.680 --> 35:31.480
Oh, so if I wanted to like hire a toothpaste selector?

35:31.480 --> 35:33.840
You wouldn't think that it's a big draw, right?

35:33.840 --> 35:36.840
I could choose the people that like get the job.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.400
No, no, no, that's not what ZipRecruiter means.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.960
You can invite people to apply for the job.

35:40.960 --> 35:44.120
It lets you pick your favorites from the best candidates.

35:44.120 --> 35:47.200
ZipRecruiter will send you qualified candidates

35:47.200 --> 35:49.480
and you can easily invite your top choices

35:49.480 --> 35:50.760
to apply for the job.

35:50.760 --> 35:51.600
You can't beat it.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.160
It's so hard finding the best people for the job

35:53.160 --> 35:55.640
and ZipRecruiter makes it easy.

35:55.640 --> 35:56.680
See for yourself.

35:56.680 --> 36:01.680

36:01.680 --> 36:03.640

36:03.640 --> 36:08.080
That's ziprecruiter.com slash M-Y-B-R-O-T-H-E-R.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.120
I'm Lisa Hanawalt.

36:12.120 --> 36:13.240
And I'm Emily Heller.

36:13.240 --> 36:14.960
Nine years ago, we started a podcast

36:14.960 --> 36:17.080
to try and learn something new every episode.

36:17.080 --> 36:19.800
Things have gone a little off the rails since then.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.080
Tune in to hear about.

36:21.080 --> 36:22.800
Low stakes neighborhood drama.

36:22.800 --> 36:23.920
Gardening.

36:23.920 --> 36:27.240
The sordid, nasty underbelly of the horse girl lifestyle.

36:27.240 --> 36:28.360
Hot sauce.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.440
Addiction to TV and sweaty takes on celebrities.

36:31.440 --> 36:32.640
Celebrity culture.

36:32.640 --> 36:34.920
And the weirdest, grossest stuff you can find

36:34.920 --> 36:36.680
on wikipedia.org.

36:36.680 --> 36:39.480
We'll read all of it, no matter how gross.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.280
There's something for everyone on our podcast,

36:41.280 --> 36:42.400
Baby Geniuses.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.800
Hosted by us, two horny adult idiots.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.680
Hang out with us as we try and fail

36:46.680 --> 36:48.480
to retain any knowledge at all.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.160
Every other week on Maximum Fun.

36:51.160 --> 36:55.160
Baby Geniuses, tell us something we don't know.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.880
Hey Griff, do you have another, do you want to start?

36:59.880 --> 37:00.720
Do you want to start a bit?

37:00.720 --> 37:01.560
I don't know.

37:01.560 --> 37:02.560
And this is a thing Justin likes to do

37:02.560 --> 37:03.800
where he basically starts things

37:03.800 --> 37:06.880
and then he really puts me in the toilet.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.960
Yeah Juice, here comes a segment that I've prepared

37:08.960 --> 37:10.360
and worked really hard on.

37:10.360 --> 37:11.880
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

37:11.880 --> 37:13.280
Okay, now what you've heard there

37:13.280 --> 37:15.480
is the opening strains to the intro music

37:15.480 --> 37:17.240
to a bit within a bit.

37:17.240 --> 37:18.400
This is called the Munch Squad,

37:18.400 --> 37:20.040
where I talk about, well you'll see.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.840
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.800
There's a call and response section of this.

37:24.800 --> 37:32.000
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.400
I wanna Munch Squad.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.440
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

37:36.440 --> 37:39.240
I want to Munch Squad.

37:39.240 --> 37:42.080
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.240
Toronto!

37:43.240 --> 37:45.200
Now, welcome Munch Squad, it's a podcast

37:45.200 --> 37:46.880
within a podcast where I profile

37:46.880 --> 37:51.040
the latest and greatest in brand eating.

37:51.040 --> 37:53.280
That means like fast food,

37:53.280 --> 37:55.920
or brand eating, I think really covers it.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.400
Yeah.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.560
When you eat a brand.

37:58.560 --> 37:59.960
Guys ever heard of Culver's?

37:59.960 --> 38:01.940
Oh yeah, we got Culver's here.

38:01.940 --> 38:02.780
You got Culver's here?

38:02.780 --> 38:03.620
Oh yeah, I like Culver's.

38:03.620 --> 38:05.040
I got big news for you, bud.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.120
The Curda Burger.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.160
What?

38:09.160 --> 38:10.160
Everyone say it once.

38:10.160 --> 38:11.400
No, I don't know what you said.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.240
I can't.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.060
Curda Burger? Curda Burger?

38:13.060 --> 38:14.760
Sorry, just say, just say, Curda Burger.

38:14.760 --> 38:15.600
Curda Burger.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.400
It's very, very egg-nuggy.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.560
Curda Burger. Curda Burger.

38:19.560 --> 38:20.960
Curda Burger.

38:20.960 --> 38:24.200
That was a very funny joke that Culver's did,

38:24.200 --> 38:27.080
which is one of the most irritating things that anybody does

38:27.080 --> 38:28.920
where it makes up a fake item

38:28.920 --> 38:31.220
to get social media to talk about it.

38:31.220 --> 38:33.160
They did it with the Curda Burger.

38:33.160 --> 38:38.160
And then that is a, it's a burger, huh?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.320
It's a Culver Butter Burger.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.160
Now that sounds different.

38:43.160 --> 38:45.000
It's a less Culver Butter Burger,

38:45.000 --> 38:48.640
the top with golden fried cheese or curds.

38:48.640 --> 38:51.200
It's a cheese-cored Curd Burger or a Curda Burger.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.040
Oh, I see.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.440
So they did this as a joke.

38:54.440 --> 38:55.280
Ah.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.040
It's a Butter Burger with curd on top.

38:57.040 --> 38:57.860
Okay.

38:57.860 --> 38:58.700
The Curda Burger.

38:58.700 --> 38:59.540
Okay.

38:59.540 --> 39:00.360
I get it.

39:00.360 --> 39:04.900
But for once, someone did the right thing.

39:04.900 --> 39:05.740
Sued them.

39:05.740 --> 39:07.720
And looked at the social media response.

39:07.720 --> 39:11.480
As we know, I'm sure, fucking uproarious

39:11.480 --> 39:12.640
to this April Fool's gag.

39:12.640 --> 39:13.480
Yeah.

39:13.480 --> 39:16.000
And the people were so incensed

39:16.000 --> 39:19.680
that the idea of Curda Burger had been created,

39:19.680 --> 39:22.400
but the physical manifestation of Curda Burger

39:22.400 --> 39:23.320
was denied to them.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.160
Right.

39:24.160 --> 39:25.640
That they realized, Culver's realized

39:25.640 --> 39:27.480
it was their moral obligation

39:28.680 --> 39:30.600
to bring the menu item to life.

39:30.600 --> 39:34.040
For one day only on National Cheese Curd Day,

39:34.040 --> 39:36.840
which is, as we all know, say it together.

39:36.840 --> 39:40.400
November 17th.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.240
October 15th.

39:41.240 --> 39:42.080
Yeah.

39:42.080 --> 39:42.900
I said it.

39:42.900 --> 39:43.740
Sorry, there was a lag.

39:43.740 --> 39:44.580
October 15th.

39:44.580 --> 39:46.240
They're launching the Curda Burger.

39:46.240 --> 39:48.320
We got a delicious crown of golden fried cheese.

39:48.320 --> 39:49.160
Damn.

39:49.160 --> 39:50.120
Makes this burger one of a kind.

39:50.120 --> 39:52.280
The cheese crown, which is-

39:52.280 --> 39:53.120
Which is a good thing.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.620
One of the names you could choose.

39:54.620 --> 39:55.460
They chose that one.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.300
Yeah.

39:56.300 --> 39:57.120
The cheese crown.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.240
I believe that was what our Lord and Savior,

39:59.240 --> 40:00.960
Jesus Christ, had to put on the crust.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.000
Travis, Travis.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.320
I think you mean cheesy crust.

40:03.320 --> 40:04.280
Cheesy crust.

40:04.280 --> 40:05.120
I'm sorry.

40:05.120 --> 40:06.120
Cheesy crust.

40:06.120 --> 40:09.360
We're incredibly proud of our, this is an answer.

40:09.360 --> 40:10.980
This is, if you hear me talking

40:10.980 --> 40:13.400
in the voice of a creative type,

40:13.400 --> 40:16.000
this is Quinn Adkins,

40:16.000 --> 40:17.660
Culver's Director of Menu Development.

40:17.660 --> 40:18.960
Quinn Adkins.

40:18.960 --> 40:21.160
The delicious crown of golden fried cheese

40:21.160 --> 40:23.680
is what makes this burger one of a kind.

40:23.680 --> 40:26.720
The cheese crown is made up of a blend of yellow

40:26.720 --> 40:28.300
and white cheddar cheese curds,

40:28.300 --> 40:31.080
all surrounded by crispy seasoned breadcrumbs.

40:31.080 --> 40:34.120
We're incredibly proud of our Wisconsin cheese curds,

40:34.120 --> 40:37.260
which is why they've slapped them into a butter burger,

40:37.260 --> 40:39.320
and our relationship with Wisconsin dairy.

40:39.320 --> 40:41.120
So the Curda Burger is just another way

40:41.120 --> 40:43.240
to showcase our trademark quality,

40:43.240 --> 40:45.780
and Wisconsin roots.

40:45.780 --> 40:48.020
Beyond the burger itself,

40:48.020 --> 40:51.120
the way the Curda Burger came into existence

40:51.120 --> 40:52.560
is a story worth telling.

40:52.560 --> 40:54.600
It all began on April Fool's Day

40:54.600 --> 40:56.500
with a prank we posted on social media.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.440
But when guests made it clear,

40:58.440 --> 41:00.920
they wanted it to be a real menu item,

41:00.920 --> 41:03.780
which was such a surprise, I think, to them.

41:03.780 --> 41:07.200
They in no way were backdoor announcing a new menu item

41:07.200 --> 41:08.040
to see the response.

41:08.040 --> 41:08.880
For sure not.

41:08.880 --> 41:09.700
Who would do that?

41:09.700 --> 41:11.400
It completely caught them by surprise.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.600
Justin, can I ask you a question legitimately?

41:13.600 --> 41:15.760
I'm trying to find a picture of this thing.

41:15.760 --> 41:17.240
What's the joke?

41:17.240 --> 41:19.200
What was the joke?

41:19.200 --> 41:21.000
It's so funny that they would put cheese.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.120
I know, this is what,

41:23.120 --> 41:27.280
everyone's doing things that are exponentially nastier.

41:27.280 --> 41:29.500
The whole world is nastier than this.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.400
It's almost sort of quaint.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.020
It's elegant.

41:33.020 --> 41:36.520
Like that they are coming out with the Curda Burger

41:36.520 --> 41:37.640
and expecting us to be like,

41:37.640 --> 41:39.820
you did what? You're wild.

41:39.820 --> 41:40.660
You what?

41:40.660 --> 41:41.500
I gotta give,

41:42.840 --> 41:45.240
I'm always dunking on people

41:45.240 --> 41:47.200
who answer the questions for QSR,

41:47.200 --> 41:50.360
which is sort of my hookup for this information.

41:50.360 --> 41:54.320
But on this one, I do have to call QSR itself out

41:54.320 --> 41:55.960
on the question they've decided to ask here,

41:55.960 --> 41:56.920
which to be fair,

41:56.920 --> 41:57.880
coming up with questions to ask

41:57.880 --> 42:00.040
about the Curda Burger can't be easy.

42:00.040 --> 42:04.320
QSR asks, why does it work from a flavor perspective?

42:05.360 --> 42:06.200
What do you think, motherfucker?

42:06.200 --> 42:08.000
It's fried cheese on a burger.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.440
It's a fried cheese on a burger, dipshit.

42:10.440 --> 42:13.840
It's not like a complex fried cheese on a burger.

42:13.840 --> 42:16.000
It's cheese and meat, but fried.

42:17.360 --> 42:20.400
From a flavor perspective, the Curda Burger,

42:20.400 --> 42:23.960
which by the way, it fails in almost every other respect.

42:23.960 --> 42:25.960
Like it is not pleasant to look upon.

42:25.960 --> 42:26.800
Or say.

42:26.800 --> 42:28.880
Let's talk about it just from a flavor perspective.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.960
The Curda Burger is an evolution

42:30.960 --> 42:32.600
of our classic Burger Burger,

42:32.600 --> 42:35.200
but adds an additional savory component

42:35.200 --> 42:37.560
with our signature blend of herbs and spices,

42:37.560 --> 42:40.760
a textural contrast with the fried crown

42:40.760 --> 42:43.680
and a tremendous visual dynamic.

42:43.680 --> 42:45.480
So from a flavor perspective,

42:45.480 --> 42:48.560
it adds a tremendous visual dynamic.

42:49.440 --> 42:50.520
I know what you're wondering, guys,

42:50.520 --> 42:51.800
because it's the same question I had.

42:51.800 --> 42:53.720
What was the R&D process like?

42:53.720 --> 42:55.480
How many attempts did it take to get it right,

42:55.480 --> 42:57.060
fried cheese on a hamburger?

42:57.060 --> 43:01.520
This, says Quinn, was a personal project of love.

43:01.520 --> 43:02.340
Was it?

43:02.340 --> 43:04.080
It developed in three months,

43:04.080 --> 43:06.200
starting in late May after the menu team

43:06.200 --> 43:09.560
saw all the attention the April Fool's message received.

43:09.560 --> 43:11.080
So just to be clear,

43:11.080 --> 43:14.240
it took you two months to read your mentions?

43:14.240 --> 43:15.680
I mean, I get it.

43:15.680 --> 43:17.320
There's probably not a lot of like,

43:17.320 --> 43:18.720
culvert discussion on there,

43:18.720 --> 43:21.220
but it seems like a long time to realize like,

43:21.220 --> 43:22.860
hey, people really want this burger.

43:22.860 --> 43:25.080
The extraordinary development speed

43:25.080 --> 43:27.840
was made possible by the talent and dedication of our team,

43:27.840 --> 43:29.640
along with the strength of our relationships

43:29.640 --> 43:32.200
with our manufacturing and supplier network

43:32.200 --> 43:34.040
without our strategic supplier.

43:34.040 --> 43:35.000
You want more cheese?

43:35.000 --> 43:35.840
Okay.

43:35.840 --> 43:36.680
All right.

43:36.680 --> 43:37.640
Yeah, the logistics of that.

43:37.640 --> 43:38.760
In this economy?

43:38.760 --> 43:39.600
Really?

43:39.600 --> 43:40.420
Okay.

43:40.420 --> 43:41.260
How much should it cost?

43:41.260 --> 43:42.120
A hundred dollars?

43:42.120 --> 43:43.920
That's too much.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.120
Five dollars?

43:45.120 --> 43:45.960
Sounds good.

43:45.960 --> 43:47.440
Guests have a high,

43:47.440 --> 43:48.680
for this item in particular,

43:48.680 --> 43:50.960
we wanted to wow our guests.

43:50.960 --> 43:53.960
So we designed a burger that went above and beyond.

43:53.960 --> 43:55.300
And this is where Quinn,

43:55.300 --> 43:57.800
like people are always using team language.

43:57.800 --> 43:59.580
I've never seen anyone do this

43:59.580 --> 44:01.120
in one of these press releases.

44:01.120 --> 44:02.580
Quinn then says,

44:02.580 --> 44:06.860
when executing my vision for the curder burger,

44:06.860 --> 44:08.820
I created a list of must haves,

44:08.820 --> 44:11.140
including functionality of design

44:11.140 --> 44:12.380
that reflected what we deliver

44:12.380 --> 44:13.760
with our current cheese curds.

44:13.760 --> 44:17.060
So both the yellow and white curds were evident.

44:17.060 --> 44:19.780
Optimizing the eating experience of the burger.

44:19.780 --> 44:22.540
So the cheese crown not only is visually appealing,

44:22.540 --> 44:25.860
but also holds together after taking a bite.

44:25.860 --> 44:29.240
Three, perfecting the size and weight of the crown

44:29.240 --> 44:31.660
so it can be consistently prepared

44:31.660 --> 44:33.580
to the highest quality in restaurant.

44:33.580 --> 44:36.180
And a high ceiling in the garage so that I can,

44:36.180 --> 44:37.540
oh, no, wait, sorry.

44:37.540 --> 44:40.720
That's for my must haves for the new house I'm going to buy

44:40.720 --> 44:43.220
after the curder burger comes out.

44:43.220 --> 44:45.460
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

44:45.460 --> 44:46.460
But here's the wild thing.

44:46.460 --> 44:48.020
All this work, all of it,

44:49.140 --> 44:50.580
for the curder burger,

44:50.580 --> 44:52.340
which is available for one day.

44:53.340 --> 44:54.700
Can you imagine?

44:54.700 --> 44:56.220
This is like a corpse flower.

44:56.220 --> 44:57.060
Yeah.

44:57.060 --> 44:57.880
Right?

44:57.880 --> 44:58.720
Yeah.

44:58.720 --> 44:59.560
Like all this work,

44:59.560 --> 45:03.540
in one day of, who cares if it's consistent?

45:03.540 --> 45:04.720
It's one day.

45:04.720 --> 45:05.980
Buy it or don't.

45:05.980 --> 45:06.820
You know what I mean?

45:06.820 --> 45:07.660
It's the worst.

45:07.660 --> 45:08.480
That's the dedication to quality I can say about it.

45:08.480 --> 45:09.320
I'll tell you what, Justin,

45:09.320 --> 45:10.940
you've really ruined me on this.

45:10.940 --> 45:14.080
After talking about the absolute R&D mad lad

45:14.080 --> 45:17.060
that worked at Wendy's that worked on a new fry recipe

45:17.060 --> 45:18.840
for two and a half years.

45:18.840 --> 45:22.240
And it's hard for me now to take anybody's R&D seriously

45:22.240 --> 45:24.580
when they're like three months we put into this.

45:24.580 --> 45:25.740
I'm like, that's nothing.

45:25.740 --> 45:26.580
That's nothing.

45:26.580 --> 45:28.020
You're a child.

45:28.020 --> 45:30.380
Talk to me when you've spent two and a half years

45:30.380 --> 45:31.220
figuring out how to make french fries.

45:31.220 --> 45:32.740
That's all I think about.

45:32.740 --> 45:37.300
I want this R&D to submerge you into a pool of madness.

45:37.300 --> 45:38.140
Yes.

45:38.140 --> 45:40.500
From which you might never return.

45:40.500 --> 45:43.740
I want this to be your Mr. Holland's opus.

45:43.740 --> 45:45.920
It tastes better to me when you don't return

45:45.920 --> 45:47.180
from the madness pool.

45:47.180 --> 45:48.100
Yes.

45:48.100 --> 45:49.460
Speaking of Wendy's fries,

45:49.460 --> 45:51.060
if I can just pivot briefly,

45:51.060 --> 45:54.340
this week, Carl Laredo, the CMO at Wendy's,

45:54.340 --> 45:56.420
posted a picture of him and his family

45:56.420 --> 45:58.580
enjoying some new Wendy's fries.

45:58.580 --> 46:00.280
And the text of this photo is,

46:00.280 --> 46:03.060
the whole family loves Wendy's new hot and crispy fries.

46:03.060 --> 46:04.180
Really, Carl?

46:04.180 --> 46:05.580
Except for Doug. What a shock.

46:05.580 --> 46:06.860
Not pictured.

46:06.860 --> 46:09.540
My shithead son, Doug, hates my fries.

46:09.540 --> 46:11.180
He's out.

46:11.180 --> 46:12.780
The company that puts food on your table

46:12.780 --> 46:14.740
put food on your table and you enjoyed it?

46:14.740 --> 46:17.780
I'll tell you what though, those fries are fucking good.

46:17.780 --> 46:20.900
And they survived the drive home in a very-

46:20.900 --> 46:23.220
Listen, I noticed too, Trav.

46:23.220 --> 46:25.140
I didn't even realize we were getting them.

46:25.140 --> 46:27.540
And then Sydney and I both ate some fries

46:27.540 --> 46:29.020
and we're like, damn.

46:29.020 --> 46:29.860
What's up?

46:29.860 --> 46:30.680
Yeah.

46:30.680 --> 46:31.520
What's up?

46:31.520 --> 46:32.380
These fries, they're good.

46:32.380 --> 46:33.220
Okay, Carl, you're right.

46:33.220 --> 46:34.420
You did, Carl.

46:34.420 --> 46:36.140
I don't think you and your family are lying, Carl.

46:36.140 --> 46:36.980
They're good fries.

46:36.980 --> 46:37.800
They're good fries.

46:37.800 --> 46:38.700
I would never say that.

46:38.700 --> 46:40.100
Not about Doris.

46:40.100 --> 46:40.940
Not about-

46:40.940 --> 46:41.760
I'd say it about-

46:41.760 --> 46:42.600
Robethany.

46:42.600 --> 46:43.460
I'd say it about Doug.

46:43.460 --> 46:45.300
Doug's a piece of shit.

46:45.300 --> 46:47.140
I don't know Carl's children's names,

46:47.140 --> 46:48.740
but I'm just going to guess it's Robethany.

46:48.740 --> 46:49.920
Robethany and Doug.

46:52.540 --> 46:54.100
Don't you?

46:54.100 --> 46:56.440
This is Carl Laredo's son, Doug Jr.

46:58.260 --> 47:00.060
He's a real twisted ride.

47:00.060 --> 47:02.200
He's the junior of a different Doug.

47:03.180 --> 47:05.240
Just a Doug that Carl knows.

47:05.240 --> 47:09.220
Is this named after my barber?

47:11.060 --> 47:13.580
He reminds me of my road dog, Doug.

47:13.580 --> 47:15.420
He's a great barber.

47:15.420 --> 47:17.260
I don't go there anymore.

47:17.260 --> 47:18.280
My name's Carl Laredo.

47:18.280 --> 47:20.180
This is my son, Dave Thomas Jr.

47:20.180 --> 47:24.260
We don't cut corners here in my family.

47:25.780 --> 47:27.580
Does Wendy's still make square patties?

47:27.580 --> 47:28.860
They don't, do they?

47:28.860 --> 47:32.000
Trav, can I charge you with getting a Curderburger?

47:32.000 --> 47:33.220
If you've got Culver's around you,

47:33.220 --> 47:35.500
will you get a Curderburger and gram it?

47:35.500 --> 47:36.340
Just gram it.

47:36.340 --> 47:37.260
Yeah, I'll put it on the gram.

47:37.260 --> 47:39.300
Yeah, how incensed would you be

47:39.300 --> 47:42.140
if you went into a non-participating Culver's-

47:42.140 --> 47:42.980
On this one day.

47:42.980 --> 47:45.660
On October 15th and know it's slipping.

47:45.660 --> 47:47.540
They're like, I don't know, let me look in the back.

47:47.540 --> 47:49.540
And you're like, I could be eating it now.

47:49.540 --> 47:50.700
This is the one chance I have.

47:50.700 --> 47:53.500
Could I get 30 of them and 29 of them are frozen?

47:53.500 --> 47:54.560
Is that possible?

47:55.460 --> 47:57.980
All the wasted time.

47:57.980 --> 48:00.980
All the Curderburgers.

48:00.980 --> 48:01.900
Okay, listen.

48:01.900 --> 48:03.820
If you only had time.

48:03.820 --> 48:05.080
That's how you go.

48:05.080 --> 48:05.980
Here's a question.

48:05.980 --> 48:07.020
Here's another question.

48:07.020 --> 48:10.140
We're gonna help two people this week.

48:10.140 --> 48:11.840
I live in a duplex,

48:11.840 --> 48:14.300
and I've only interacted with my neighbor once

48:14.300 --> 48:15.500
back when we moved in.

48:16.460 --> 48:18.120
The other day, I could hear him singing a song

48:18.120 --> 48:20.700
from Les Miserables through the wall.

48:20.700 --> 48:21.820
Here's the thing.

48:21.820 --> 48:24.140
I also love to sing show tunes.

48:24.140 --> 48:26.480
How do I approach him about our shared interests?

48:26.480 --> 48:27.480
Without letting him know,

48:27.480 --> 48:29.380
I could hear his private singing moments.

48:29.380 --> 48:31.180
That's from Perplexed in a duplex.

48:32.060 --> 48:33.380
Why not let him know?

48:33.380 --> 48:35.500
This is very strange to me.

48:35.500 --> 48:36.460
Why?

48:36.460 --> 48:37.300
It's very strange.

48:37.300 --> 48:38.700
Why is that?

48:38.700 --> 48:43.620
Because this is a new bit that I've invented for the show

48:43.620 --> 48:46.240
where I say, I don't know, and I let my brothers help me.

48:46.240 --> 48:49.340
Cause I have one version of this,

48:49.340 --> 48:52.100
a different version of this exact same problem.

48:52.100 --> 48:54.980
Yesterday, or no, it's been a few days now.

48:54.980 --> 48:59.580
I was driving up to my home and I passed a neighbor.

48:59.580 --> 49:03.380
He's an older gentleman who I've since learned is a widower

49:03.380 --> 49:05.020
living there on his own.

49:05.020 --> 49:08.180
And I passed him and his cars

49:08.180 --> 49:09.660
are always in the driveway, right?

49:09.660 --> 49:10.500
I passed him.

49:10.500 --> 49:14.300
I looked in his garage and he had this fucking sick

49:14.300 --> 49:17.140
woodworking shop, like sick,

49:17.140 --> 49:20.260
like real, real choice stuff, right?

49:21.700 --> 49:25.500
And I'm like, oh damn, that guy's deep in the paint

49:25.500 --> 49:26.500
on woodworking.

49:26.500 --> 49:27.940
And then I started thinking like,

49:27.940 --> 49:30.140
it would be cool to have someone who lives

49:30.140 --> 49:32.940
like a couple of houses away be like-

49:32.940 --> 49:33.780
Work wood with.

49:33.780 --> 49:36.500
A fellow woodworker, like if I get some scraps,

49:36.500 --> 49:37.900
I'll kick him his way.

49:37.900 --> 49:39.580
He comes in, he's like, Justin,

49:39.580 --> 49:43.960
I need a number eight, three inch deck screw.

49:43.960 --> 49:46.860
I can help him out, you know what I mean?

49:46.860 --> 49:50.900
But I can't for the life of me think of a way.

49:50.900 --> 49:52.900
I don't know him at all.

49:52.900 --> 49:56.540
So I can't for the life of me think of a way

49:56.540 --> 49:59.300
to elegantly be like-

49:59.300 --> 50:01.540
And I've expressed this concern to my wife.

50:01.540 --> 50:02.380
She can't think of anything.

50:02.380 --> 50:03.420
She's the smartest person I know.

50:03.420 --> 50:04.260
Can't think of anything.

50:04.260 --> 50:07.260
I don't know how to elegantly knock on the door

50:07.260 --> 50:11.380
and be like, listen, I looked in your garage.

50:11.380 --> 50:14.060
And it was bright in there and I looked in there

50:14.060 --> 50:16.820
and I saw that you love wood and I love wood too.

50:16.820 --> 50:19.180
And I just want you to know I'm here for you.

50:19.180 --> 50:21.780
We could be like, not friends in the traditional sense,

50:21.780 --> 50:22.620
but you know-

50:22.620 --> 50:23.940
We could share a connection.

50:23.940 --> 50:25.540
We could be wood buddies.

50:25.540 --> 50:26.700
So what are you guys saying?

50:26.700 --> 50:28.220
Your problem is Justin,

50:28.220 --> 50:29.900
you're hung up on the elegant part.

50:29.900 --> 50:30.940
There isn't.

50:30.940 --> 50:32.020
Hold on, I'm getting some water.

50:32.020 --> 50:32.860
You can just keep talking.

50:32.860 --> 50:33.700
Can you hear me?

50:34.960 --> 50:35.800
Wait.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.140
Why would he ask for your advice?

50:37.140 --> 50:38.760
He asked me for advice and then he was like,

50:38.760 --> 50:40.260
I'm fucking leaving.

50:40.260 --> 50:41.080
Pay you back.

50:41.080 --> 50:43.860
The problem is, Justin, you're caught up on the elegant.

50:43.860 --> 50:44.800
There isn't an elegant.

50:44.800 --> 50:45.640
Well, I don't want it to be weird.

50:45.640 --> 50:46.940
But here's the thing, man.

50:46.940 --> 50:47.980
We get asked all the time,

50:47.980 --> 50:49.700
how do I make friends with an adult?

50:49.700 --> 50:51.820
And that is because we are worried about that weird moment.

50:51.820 --> 50:53.140
You know who I'm fucking worried about that?

50:53.140 --> 50:54.620
Five-year-olds.

50:54.620 --> 50:55.460
You know?

50:55.460 --> 50:57.020
You're just gonna have to roll up and say,

50:57.020 --> 50:59.820
hey, I noticed that you have woodworking stuff.

50:59.820 --> 51:01.620
I also am interested in woodworking.

51:01.620 --> 51:02.460
Okay, imagine it.

51:02.460 --> 51:03.540
Like really start to break it down

51:03.540 --> 51:05.700
to its base components though.

51:05.700 --> 51:06.900
Is he in the shop when I do this?

51:06.900 --> 51:08.100
I don't know.

51:08.100 --> 51:08.940
But-

51:08.940 --> 51:09.780
Exactly.

51:09.780 --> 51:10.620
Yeah, Justin.

51:10.620 --> 51:11.900
I mean, do I knock on his front door?

51:11.900 --> 51:13.220
Yes.

51:13.220 --> 51:14.740
In the middle of dinner, Travis?

51:14.740 --> 51:16.060
No, why did I dinner with him?

51:16.060 --> 51:17.620
I didn't say that.

51:17.620 --> 51:19.220
Travis, why am I interrupting his dinner?

51:19.220 --> 51:21.660
He was spraying, Travis.

51:21.660 --> 51:24.140
No, don't interrupt his dinner.

51:24.140 --> 51:25.740
He got out of the bath.

51:25.740 --> 51:26.940
Four o'clock, Justin.

51:26.940 --> 51:30.340
Four p.m. is a save for the husky neighbor boys

51:30.340 --> 51:32.540
that's always carrying terrible wood scraps

51:32.540 --> 51:33.980
out through his trash.

51:33.980 --> 51:36.860
And Justin saw everything, Travis.

51:36.860 --> 51:39.820
How can their relationship possibly recover from this?

51:39.820 --> 51:42.260
Well, then he answered the door in the nude.

51:42.260 --> 51:43.580
Great idea, Travis.

51:43.580 --> 51:44.900
Pervert.

51:44.900 --> 51:46.820
Okay, well, I was trying to, okay.

51:46.820 --> 51:48.500
I was trying to actually help our brother, Justin.

51:48.500 --> 51:49.340
And then you guys call me-

51:49.340 --> 51:50.180
No, help him.

51:50.180 --> 51:51.620
I'm telling you, I'm serious.

51:51.620 --> 51:53.300
Do I knock on his door?

51:53.300 --> 51:54.780
Is there someone at the door?

51:54.780 --> 51:55.700
Yeah, you knock on-

51:55.700 --> 51:57.700
And then imagine it, whatever you tell-

51:57.700 --> 51:58.700
I'm gonna move the mic.

51:58.700 --> 52:03.700
Whatever you tell me, imagine it happening to you, Travis.

52:03.780 --> 52:05.660
Hey, I heard your podcast.

52:05.660 --> 52:06.660
I'm a stranger.

52:08.100 --> 52:09.340
Yeah.

52:09.340 --> 52:10.180
No.

52:10.180 --> 52:12.460
There is risk involved, Justin.

52:12.460 --> 52:13.300
Don't get me wrong.

52:13.300 --> 52:14.540
There is a risk involved,

52:14.540 --> 52:17.580
but the reward of having your own wood buddy-

52:17.580 --> 52:18.420
Yeah.

52:18.420 --> 52:19.260
Is the reward.

52:19.260 --> 52:22.300
Like, you think you're just gonna get that for free?

52:22.300 --> 52:24.460
You're waiting for the universe to give you

52:24.460 --> 52:27.100
like an excuse to talk to this wood friend?

52:27.100 --> 52:28.740
Do I, now, let me ask you this.

52:28.740 --> 52:30.500
Here's some alternate plans.

52:30.500 --> 52:33.260
If I don't have the bravery for what you said,

52:33.260 --> 52:37.220
because he's in dinner, do I send a note?

52:37.220 --> 52:38.060
Is I send a letter?

52:38.060 --> 52:38.900
No.

52:38.900 --> 52:40.620
If it's black wood, do you like me?

52:40.620 --> 52:41.460
Check yes or no.

52:41.460 --> 52:42.300
No, Justin.

52:42.300 --> 52:43.140
What's up with that?

52:43.140 --> 52:43.980
He's not gonna-

52:43.980 --> 52:44.820
And if so, would I mail it?

52:44.820 --> 52:45.660
Cause that's weird, right?

52:45.660 --> 52:49.180
Now, if you carve a plaque that says that,

52:49.180 --> 52:51.460
and you deliver a hand-carved wooden-

52:51.460 --> 52:53.860
You're saying that's the introduction,

52:53.860 --> 52:56.940
just to be like, here is where my skills are at.

52:56.940 --> 52:57.780
Right, right, right, right, right.

52:57.780 --> 52:59.740
Oh, I thought you were saying leave it at his doorstep.

52:59.740 --> 53:01.260
Like, this is from your secret wood-

53:01.260 --> 53:03.140
Oh no, I did mean that.

53:03.140 --> 53:04.220
Okay, good.

53:04.220 --> 53:05.380
But it's a carved wooden plaque.

53:05.380 --> 53:08.140
So he's gonna see, like, this is weird, but-

53:08.140 --> 53:08.980
Bring it to the table, right?

53:08.980 --> 53:10.460
There's something here.

53:10.460 --> 53:13.460
I see, also, I know that this is Justin,

53:13.460 --> 53:15.060
cause he's still walking away.

53:15.060 --> 53:16.460
I could see him, right?

53:16.460 --> 53:18.220
He rang the doorbell and I answered it,

53:18.220 --> 53:19.980
and I see him walking away.

53:19.980 --> 53:22.060
And at a leisurely pace, frankly.

53:22.060 --> 53:24.060
And he's watching me very closely

53:24.060 --> 53:27.020
to check my reactions to what he, to-

53:27.020 --> 53:28.780
Hey, Justin, come on.

53:28.780 --> 53:31.660
Yeah, yeah, this is good.

53:31.660 --> 53:33.020
I have some notes.

53:33.020 --> 53:36.540
I think people who are experienced in a craft or hobby

53:36.540 --> 53:38.380
are always looking for an opportunity

53:38.380 --> 53:40.100
to flex that on other people.

53:40.100 --> 53:40.940
Yes.

53:40.940 --> 53:44.220
So you need to supplicate yourself to him.

53:44.220 --> 53:48.260
And maybe, like, you go up with a shitty bird house

53:48.260 --> 53:50.660
that is glued to the side of your head.

53:50.660 --> 53:52.940
And you'd be like, um, hi, I'm your neighbor.

53:52.940 --> 53:56.580
I can help but notice that you have some wood stuff.

53:56.580 --> 54:01.100
And I am also into it, but I did this.

54:01.100 --> 54:04.340
And do you have any kind of solvent or something

54:04.340 --> 54:07.660
that won't be bad for my skin?

54:07.660 --> 54:09.900
Cause I have really goofed up over here.

54:09.900 --> 54:13.940
That person will be so excited for the opportunity to-

54:13.940 --> 54:15.740
Yeah, that's probably true.

54:15.740 --> 54:16.780
That's probably true.

54:18.500 --> 54:21.620
But then they're gonna know the next time you make a,

54:21.620 --> 54:24.420
you know, a nice stool.

54:24.420 --> 54:27.020
They're gonna be like, you fucking rope-a-doped me.

54:27.020 --> 54:28.500
And then you say, no, I couldn't have done it

54:28.500 --> 54:30.340
without your tutelage.

54:30.340 --> 54:32.740
Yeah, when you- You've inspired me.

54:32.740 --> 54:34.940
When you pried that bird house off my face.

54:34.940 --> 54:37.220
That was- It must have released something

54:37.220 --> 54:39.340
in my brain. Right.

54:39.340 --> 54:41.180
By which I mean a pneumatic staple

54:41.180 --> 54:43.020
that I think I accidentally fired.

54:43.020 --> 54:45.060
It's somewhere in there.

54:45.060 --> 54:47.540
From what I know about rotary saws,

54:47.540 --> 54:50.220
is they like to just fly on off the handle

54:50.220 --> 54:53.260
and just go zip zap and wherever they wanna go.

54:53.260 --> 54:54.900
So maybe you could embed one of those

54:54.900 --> 54:57.860
in the side of his house and then knock on his door

54:57.860 --> 55:00.500
and just be like, hey, this happened.

55:00.500 --> 55:03.420
And as a fellow woodsman, I'm sure you know

55:03.420 --> 55:05.500
all about these stinkers.

55:05.500 --> 55:09.580
What if he, I'm more, I think there's a non-zero chance

55:09.580 --> 55:12.420
that he would take my tools away.

55:12.420 --> 55:13.300
Oh. Wait, you're saying

55:13.300 --> 55:15.540
that if you introduced yourself as a fellow woodworker,

55:15.540 --> 55:17.140
he'd be like, no, not you.

55:17.140 --> 55:18.820
No, you're not. You're not grown up enough

55:18.820 --> 55:20.260
for this. He would confiscate them

55:20.260 --> 55:23.740
from you, a 40-year-old parent of two.

55:23.740 --> 55:27.780
He might confiscate my saws, all my beautiful saws.

55:27.780 --> 55:29.620
And what if, maybe he just takes the screws

55:29.620 --> 55:31.140
until I've learned my lesson.

55:31.140 --> 55:34.580
But then, isn't that what we all want, Justin?

55:35.460 --> 55:38.660
You're looking for a wood father figure.

55:38.660 --> 55:39.820
Yeah.

55:39.820 --> 55:43.300
Well, the problem is like, just this past week,

55:43.300 --> 55:45.500
I made a footstool for my daughter

55:45.500 --> 55:47.540
and I couldn't get it balanced.

55:47.540 --> 55:49.740
Like, you know how you build something,

55:49.740 --> 55:51.780
it's always a crapshoot when you make something

55:51.780 --> 55:53.900
that's supposed to stand on the ground on multiple legs.

55:53.900 --> 55:57.140
And I said it was like wobbly, so I cut it down

55:57.140 --> 55:59.780
and then it was still wobbly, but the wrong way.

55:59.780 --> 56:02.020
And I kept cutting it until it eventually

56:02.020 --> 56:05.660
was offering a negligible height differential

56:05.660 --> 56:06.500
from the ground.

56:06.500 --> 56:09.260
And then I got so frustrated that I threw it on the ground

56:09.260 --> 56:11.220
and smashed it with a big hammer.

56:11.220 --> 56:14.380
And I think that he should,

56:14.380 --> 56:16.980
I think maybe he should take my tools away.

56:16.980 --> 56:17.820
Oh, Justin.

56:17.820 --> 56:19.940
I don't think that, I think someone should be parenting.

56:19.940 --> 56:21.660
Maybe you need to approach him in that way then

56:21.660 --> 56:24.740
and be like, well, can I apprentice with you?

56:24.740 --> 56:26.660
Can I trust you to stop me?

56:26.660 --> 56:28.340
Because that's what I did, man.

56:28.340 --> 56:30.060
I found myself a blacksmith teacher,

56:30.060 --> 56:31.340
I apprenticed with him.

56:31.340 --> 56:32.620
It makes him really uncomfortable

56:32.620 --> 56:34.380
when I refer to myself as his apprentice,

56:34.380 --> 56:35.580
but here we are, you know?

56:35.580 --> 56:36.620
Makes me uncomfortable

56:36.620 --> 56:37.740
and I'm not even part of the equation.

56:37.740 --> 56:40.060
I will often say like, am I a journeyman yet?

56:40.060 --> 56:42.460
And he's like, what the fuck are you talking about, Travis?

56:42.460 --> 56:44.620
I'm like, ah, thank you, that's wise.

56:44.620 --> 56:47.580
Juice, next time you fuck up a project like that,

56:47.580 --> 56:51.180
hold on to it, or at least hold on to the scraps

56:51.180 --> 56:54.700
of when you smash it because of your insatiable rage.

56:54.700 --> 56:57.140
And then look at the 10-day forecast,

56:57.140 --> 56:59.380
see when the next big rainstorm's coming,

56:59.380 --> 57:02.780
and then show up at his door soaked to the bone.

57:02.780 --> 57:03.620
Oh, yay, yay.

57:03.620 --> 57:05.900
Maybe even if you want to go this route,

57:05.900 --> 57:09.940
your t-shirt sticking to your body a little bit

57:09.940 --> 57:10.780
and you show up with the scraps.

57:10.780 --> 57:13.660
Not in a sexual way, but in a sensual way, for sure.

57:13.660 --> 57:15.740
Well, or just a, you know, however kind of way

57:15.740 --> 57:18.940
you want to frame it, but with the scraps in your hands.

57:18.940 --> 57:22.100
And then you can make yourself cry and just be like,

57:22.100 --> 57:24.900
I don't, just say like, I don't know.

57:24.900 --> 57:28.540
And then have him just, shh, shh, shh, shh, come on in.

57:28.540 --> 57:30.060
And I think he's going to be into it.

57:30.060 --> 57:32.100
I'm going to give you this one for free, Justin.

57:32.100 --> 57:34.420
Would you help me with this?

57:34.420 --> 57:35.260
That's funny.

57:35.260 --> 57:38.420
And he's going to know that you're a real deal guy

57:38.420 --> 57:41.300
when you come at him with genuine Goodwood humor like that.

57:41.300 --> 57:43.380
Now what's going to be confusing is when he responds,

57:43.380 --> 57:45.100
I think not.

57:45.100 --> 57:47.340
And you're not going to be sure if that's a no

57:47.340 --> 57:48.540
or if that's another pun.

57:48.540 --> 57:50.340
Yeah.

57:50.340 --> 57:51.740
That's going to be hard to parse.

57:51.740 --> 57:54.100
I understand that, but that's the test.

57:54.100 --> 57:55.780
What if I start misinterpreting like,

57:55.780 --> 57:58.900
I saw you walking towards my house, so I called the cops.

57:58.900 --> 58:01.340
And they're like, whoa, saw, I get it, funny.

58:01.340 --> 58:02.220
Good stuff.

58:02.220 --> 58:03.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:03.060 --> 58:03.900
Good stuff.

58:03.900 --> 58:05.740
I heard you hammering on my door screaming,

58:05.740 --> 58:08.420
please, please let me in.

58:08.420 --> 58:09.740
I wish you'd cut it out.

58:09.740 --> 58:10.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:10.580 --> 58:12.060
Cut, it's funny.

58:12.060 --> 58:12.900
Like Woods, right?

58:12.900 --> 58:14.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:14.380 --> 58:15.780
Yeah, I get it.

58:15.780 --> 58:17.740
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

58:17.740 --> 58:19.420
If this is your first time,

58:19.420 --> 58:20.620
we hope you've enjoyed yourself.

58:20.620 --> 58:23.460
We release a new one of these almost every Monday.

58:23.460 --> 58:25.900
We used to miss a lot, but we barely ever do that anymore.

58:25.900 --> 58:28.340
Sometimes it's just a little late because of life.

58:28.340 --> 58:29.380
Yeah, or a little bad.

58:29.380 --> 58:30.220
Yeah.

58:30.220 --> 58:31.060
You never know.

58:31.060 --> 58:32.220
Come hell or high water though,

58:32.220 --> 58:33.380
there'll be something here for you.

58:33.380 --> 58:35.740
Statistically, there are about 300 good episodes

58:35.740 --> 58:36.980
in here somewhere, so.

58:36.980 --> 58:37.820
Yeah, sure.

58:37.820 --> 58:38.660
Yeah, run the numbers.

58:38.660 --> 58:40.340
Oh, speaking of, if you are a new listener,

58:40.340 --> 58:44.380
just start on like 150 or 200 and work forward from there.

58:44.380 --> 58:45.420
Yeah. Yeah.

58:45.420 --> 58:48.260
Or start at the newest one, but not the last one.

58:48.260 --> 58:49.100
Skip the last one.

58:49.100 --> 58:50.140
The last episode was fantastic.

58:50.140 --> 58:51.940
I won't take this slander.

58:51.940 --> 58:53.140
Okay, good.

58:53.140 --> 58:54.340
Yeah, listen to whatever one's-

58:54.340 --> 58:55.660
And as you're working backwards,

58:55.660 --> 58:56.700
when you hit a point, you're like,

58:56.700 --> 58:57.740
well, this seems weird.

58:57.740 --> 58:58.580
Stop.

58:58.580 --> 58:59.420
Stop there.

58:59.420 --> 59:00.260
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

59:00.260 --> 59:01.100
Oh God.

59:01.100 --> 59:01.940
Yeah, yeah.

59:01.940 --> 59:03.220
If the mics get bad, it's-

59:03.220 --> 59:04.860
The content will follow.

59:04.860 --> 59:07.900
The thoughts, the thoughts will also be bad.

59:09.140 --> 59:09.980
And you know what?

59:09.980 --> 59:11.980
This is also a good time if you are,

59:11.980 --> 59:13.420
if you've been a listener of My Brother,

59:13.420 --> 59:14.660
My Brother and Me for a while,

59:14.660 --> 59:17.420
why not check out other MaxFun shows during this period?

59:17.420 --> 59:19.940
They're gonna be doing other kind of intro shows like this

59:19.940 --> 59:21.540
to welcome in a new audience.

59:21.540 --> 59:23.340
We've got some crossover stuff that we did

59:23.340 --> 59:26.060
that's gonna be in a new feed.

59:26.060 --> 59:29.100
We did a crossover with Maximum Film

59:29.100 --> 59:30.540
where we talked about good and bad advice

59:30.540 --> 59:31.380
that we learned for the-

59:31.380 --> 59:32.220
Oh, this is fun.

59:32.220 --> 59:33.260
Fun as hell.

59:33.260 --> 59:36.220
Teresa and I did a Schmaners crossover with Titan Fights

59:36.220 --> 59:38.540
where we talked about the etiquette of pro wrestling

59:38.540 --> 59:42.660
and some famous rivalries and some locker room etiquette.

59:42.660 --> 59:44.380
It was an absolute blast.

59:44.380 --> 59:45.220
So check that out.

59:45.220 --> 59:49.060
You can find out more at MaximumFun.org slash Block Party.

59:49.060 --> 59:50.940
It's going until October 22nd.

59:50.940 --> 59:53.900
And it's not just shows and stuff on the network.

59:53.900 --> 59:56.180
There's gonna be volunteer events

59:56.180 --> 59:59.140
and limited edition posters and games.

59:59.140 --> 01:00:04.140
I'm doing a Jackbox game stream on this Thursday

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:07.620
at 9 p.m. Eastern time with Janet Varney

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:11.460
and Carrie Poppe and James Arthur.

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.060
And it's gonna be an absolute blast.

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:15.780
Justin, you and Sydney are doing a stream too, right?

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.700
Yeah, I think it's Friday night after that

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:22.180
where we're watching F9 finally and live streaming that.

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.020
There you go.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:23.860
So make sure you check that out.

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:26.660

for two weeks after the show.

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.420
We're doing another Hootenanny episode,

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:49.260
which is our Lasers and Feelings RPG

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:53.900
where we play a space, like country band,

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.660
traveling the stars, playing country music.

01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:00.660
You can get tickets for that at bit.ly slash TazVirtual.

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:04.740
Our theme song is My Life is Better With You by Montaigne.

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:08.500
It's a great track and the music video is very fun.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.260
It's got us and Montaigne in it.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.980
Go listen to all of Montaigne's music

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.860
if you've never made that dive.

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:19.860
She's incredible and her tunes really slap, man.

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:21.860
Yeah, they really slap.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.060
We also have new merch over at McElroyMerch.com,

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:25.420
including our pin of the month,

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:27.820
which is from TazJustUs,

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:31.220
Gryphon's character Hellraven, AKA Del Craven.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.860
Sales of that pin of the month benefit

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.660
the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice,

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:37.860
which builds Latina and Latinx power

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.580
to fight for the fundamental human right

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.940
to reproductive health, dignity, and justice.

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:42.980
There's other stuff there too.

01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:45.420
Go check it out, McElroyMerch.com.

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:49.380
And this is where we come to a bit of an awkward moment

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.580
for new listeners. Not for me.

01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:53.100
Because there's no way for you to know

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:56.100
that we used to use the Yahoo answer service a lot

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.500
as our source of questions,

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.260
but we don't do that as much anymore.

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:00.500
Because it died.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.340
Because it died.

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:03.300
So now we're kind of lost on that front.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.220
Except for all the ones that I stockpiled.

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:08.420
Okay, okay, and Gryphon pretend.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.120
All the ones I stockpiled before we got gone.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.040
So this one was sent in by Jim.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.460
From the office?

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:15.500
Davis.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.340
Oh.

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:17.500
Oh, from the Garfields.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.540
Yes, and.

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.800
From the Garfield office where they make Garfield.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.920
And it's asked by Rudy.

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:31.900
Rudy Giuliani, the scary Rudy Giuliani.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:32.740
That's just scarier.

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:34.860
Yeah, I was gonna say.

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:38.760
It's from BootyGuliani who says.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:42.100
Oh no, you're making me like that character now.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.980
Oh, Booty, don't get me wrong.

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:46.720
BootyGuliani is fantastic.

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.760
BootyGuliani asks.

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.220
Yeah?

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.140
What?

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:57.340
Yeah, what?

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.020
Just read it, Gryphon.

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:01.000
BootyGuliani asks,

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:04.140
does anyone want to join me in

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:09.140
in filing a class action lawsuit

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.660
against Dick's Last Resort?

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:19.060
They made me feel very small.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:35.060
That's the one that wasn't guilty, it's the guilty one.

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.300
Oh, God bless.

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:49.300
Oh no, that, you know what's funny?

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:52.900
That would be like the fifth most embarrassing thing

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:54.540
he's done in his life.

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:57.500
I mean, it wouldn't even top the chart.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.500
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.300
I'm Gryphon McElroy.

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.220
This has been my brother and me,

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:18.220
Gryphon McElroy, and I'll see you guys next time.

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:36.220
It's better with you.

01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:06.220
Ah, okay, says the doctor.

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.220
In which case, try listening

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:11.220
