WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:51.280
I was working in the lab late one night, when my eyes beheld a eerie sight,

00:51.280 --> 00:58.080
for my brother from his lab began to rise, and suddenly he did advise him,

00:58.080 --> 01:01.520
and he said, MBM, MBM, it was my brother and my brother and me.

01:28.080 --> 01:33.160
I could have written something before I think I also think that there's a certain amount to be said about

01:33.840 --> 01:39.700
Like parodying novelty novelty songs. Yeah, that's very meta. That's a good point Travis

01:40.440 --> 01:47.120
There's a Halloween channel on Pandora, and you will be surprised to hear that it's not just monster mash

01:48.160 --> 01:54.440
Just monster mash and thriller and thriller monster mash mashups. Yeah thriller monster mash werewolf bar mitzvah

01:54.440 --> 01:59.200
Just you know it's a constantly. There's also Halloween parodies of songs like creepy game of poker

02:03.840 --> 02:08.480
One of my favorite OAR parodies this haunt me maybe

02:10.480 --> 02:15.880
That's a great one I love that walking walking in Memphis, but there's

02:16.680 --> 02:19.360
Ghosts all around there's already ghosts

02:19.360 --> 02:24.160
Oh wait, do you mean walking dead in Memphis there? We go. They nailed it

02:24.960 --> 02:26.520
fuck

02:26.520 --> 02:32.520
Then there's Gangnam style, but first spooks yeah, well come style boost spookum style

02:33.640 --> 02:38.000
How is your guys did you guys party last night? Yeah? It's ectoplasmic I?

02:39.000 --> 02:42.960
Am I am partying this evening because it is the traditional

02:42.960 --> 02:49.760
Theater weekend right night. Yeah, yeah sure you have everything special everything has to be special

02:49.760 --> 02:54.200
I was I was mr.. Belvedere, and this year again

02:54.720 --> 02:57.800
And not again, but this time this time out in public

02:57.800 --> 03:05.180
Yeah, this time this time for Halloween this time for Halloween and not just your Brock tune not to get my sad card um I

03:05.180 --> 03:13.100
I was mr.. Belvedere and last night over a party with lots of friends of ours of mine from college

03:13.100 --> 03:16.360
And they all knew who I was but I went to a party

03:17.500 --> 03:21.140
with Sidney's doctor friends who

03:22.900 --> 03:29.800
Maybe don't have their finger as close on the cultural pulse or are perhaps younger and

03:30.520 --> 03:32.900
The popular guest there was 1800

03:32.900 --> 03:34.780
a bartender

03:34.780 --> 03:37.980
Okay, so but real quick. What kind of pulse

03:38.660 --> 03:40.660
Does that show?

03:40.740 --> 03:44.260
Possibly have at this point. Well. They just like cultural

03:44.940 --> 03:49.540
Osmosis things that you absorb about mr.. Belvedere

03:50.060 --> 03:55.180
Without actually watching mr.. Belvedere. I guess I'm just a cultural awareness

03:55.300 --> 04:01.440
Maybe the same way that I'm aware of gun smoke sure maybe they've made a few jokes about it on Family Guy

04:01.440 --> 04:07.240
Yeah, right. That's what it looks it up on YouTube. They saw the SNL bit on YouTube. You're talking about secondhand

04:07.240 --> 04:11.720
I went as over there. Yes, so I went as homeless Elmo

04:12.120 --> 04:18.380
To a Halloween party where I knew maybe five percent of the people at the party and this this costume was I found

04:19.200 --> 04:25.160
Elmo torso and Elmo head and it's very convincing and then I stippled on a beard on my face

04:25.160 --> 04:32.480
And I put on like gym shorts over some sweatpants and like a t-shirt, and it's real dirty not that

04:32.480 --> 04:37.120
That's what all homeless people look like but obviously I was trying to you know over exaggerate for the God

04:37.120 --> 04:39.600
I'm thinking about now this costumes a little offensive

04:39.600 --> 04:44.800
But it was built into the fiction of Mitt Romney shuts down Sesame Street

04:45.240 --> 04:50.400
Elmo suddenly has no place to go except the real street, and so this is what I was wearing

04:50.400 --> 04:58.080
And I would say all but maybe one of the people I didn't know at this party. They would see me and be like oh, it's Elmo

04:59.200 --> 05:03.760
It's like yeah, but you're not like wondering why I have a fucking like stippled on beard

05:03.760 --> 05:09.560
And I'm wearing like dog shit clothes. It's it's morning Elmo. I guess shit together yet

05:10.440 --> 05:16.640
It made me very frustrated. I put a lot of work into the the invention and I feel like people just saw the head

05:16.640 --> 05:23.440
And they you know yeah this evening. I'm going to be going as Marty McFly from Back to the Future and

05:24.080 --> 05:28.080
I feel as though I'm relying heavily on props to really help me

05:28.400 --> 05:32.920
Impress the people because the costume in and of itself is not that impressive. It's just a vest

05:33.040 --> 05:39.280
Yeah, it's a vest and like a jean jacket and a shirt and some pants, but I'm building my own hoverboard

05:40.280 --> 05:42.280
non-functional and

05:42.280 --> 05:48.000
I bought myself a big clunky 80s video camera and a Walkman and some headphones

05:48.000 --> 05:50.280
And I'm hoping that this will carry me through

05:51.600 --> 05:54.800
How are you in them Dawson's Creek wait?

06:00.720 --> 06:06.400
Okay here in a couple seasons towards the end a bartender shows up, okay, who?

06:07.560 --> 06:10.080
Inexplicably cosplays as Marty McFly every day

06:10.080 --> 06:15.840
I know it ever references it, but he's dressed exactly like Marty McFly all the time

06:15.840 --> 06:21.200
I can't wait. I can't wait to not have the burden of that show hanging over me anymore

06:21.200 --> 06:27.680
I just can't wait to be done with it. I'll watch these now aren't you you're like in so very deep

06:28.440 --> 06:30.440
Danger deep and I want to be out

06:30.920 --> 06:36.040
Okay, I want you to jump in this hole with me because you've been here before I know the way out

06:36.040 --> 06:41.320
You know there's the way out you keep digging at the bottom you hit China by which I mean the season finale

06:45.600 --> 06:50.200
Can we please stop the show now how long we've been doing it you want to get back into it, right?

06:50.200 --> 06:53.400
You got that disc just calling your name. I don't want to wait

06:54.080 --> 06:58.280
Actually, no, it's the DVD so the DVD has the song the knockoff has

06:58.280 --> 07:01.560
This heart is in my hands

07:03.880 --> 07:07.400
Do the whole thing yeah, let's do this has been so funny

07:09.680 --> 07:14.640
So far so funny my brother my brother me and if I should this is our Halloween episode

07:14.720 --> 07:19.480
So we're only talking about ghosts and Dawson's Creek Dawson's Creek

07:20.440 --> 07:25.480
When looking for a new apartment, I asked the realtor if the house I was looking at was haunted

07:25.480 --> 07:29.760
She said she isn't legally allowed to talk about that. It's that code for yes

07:30.040 --> 07:33.440
It makes me nervous because I get the vibe Virginia can be pretty haunted

07:35.960 --> 07:43.400
Sure, so Ohio is for lovers when Virginia is for lovers who killed each other and a terrible passion

07:46.200 --> 07:49.940
God I hope that's true. I hope that when you're getting like your your Realtors license

07:49.940 --> 07:56.500
It's like you can tell them about the bathrooms talk about the hardwood floors if they ask about ghosts legally

07:56.500 --> 07:58.260
You must be well legally

07:58.260 --> 08:01.700
I don't think they can talk about if like somebody was murdered in the house

08:01.700 --> 08:05.660
Which is the number of ghosts don't just like fucking wander from house to house like oh

08:05.660 --> 08:09.140
It seems like a pretty good place to set up go shot check out two and a half bath

08:09.460 --> 08:15.020
For how much is that a day? That's gonna feel good on my ghost. Oh, it's got like a pool grotto thing

08:15.020 --> 08:21.860
Yeah, I love in here. I love the idea that the first week of realtor school is prices and

08:22.580 --> 08:24.580
like cleaning the house and

08:25.260 --> 08:31.300
Decoration and the second week is ghosts and goes related questions like listen today

08:31.300 --> 08:38.220
We're gonna deal with a sensitive topic of if you are asked about ghosts tomorrow. They talk about Indian burial grounds

08:38.580 --> 08:40.100
Right. Yeah

08:40.100 --> 08:43.800
Curse placed on the threshold. Is it possible that they?

08:43.800 --> 08:44.880
um

08:44.880 --> 08:48.600
They just actually have a week called smart-ass visitors

08:49.120 --> 08:53.040
Yeah, and it's just things that you say to people who are smart asses that come to look at your house

08:54.320 --> 08:57.120
Why is this person using a realtor to find an apartment?

08:57.960 --> 08:59.960
Yeah, I found an apartment

09:00.600 --> 09:04.880
With a Ouija board. I just carried it around the Ouija board and wait

09:04.880 --> 09:10.400
Oh, I know we're trying to make this this spooktacular episode, but we didn't we don't need to fictionalize. You're right

09:10.400 --> 09:14.000
I don't know why I felt the need to embellish my life. My life's been just fine

09:14.000 --> 09:17.600
I don't know why I need to embellish. Have you guys ever seen a ghost? Oh

09:19.040 --> 09:21.520
Man Wow, just went right for it

09:23.040 --> 09:31.240
Before we spend an hour talking about what yahoo thinks about ghosts we should really dig deep and do some spiritual exploration

09:32.440 --> 09:35.080
How we be in real talk. I might still be drunk

09:35.080 --> 09:41.680
Is this a real talk? Are we doing a real talk ghost? I don't know Travis. I don't know Travis

09:41.680 --> 09:43.680
Can you make it funny or will it be sad?

09:44.240 --> 09:48.920
It'll be sad. I want to hear oh now you have to sorry. Let me clear mine up

09:48.920 --> 09:55.680
No, cuz ghosts aren't real. Go on Travis. I mean neither of us like listen neither of us. Hey, listen, we're all friends here

09:55.880 --> 10:02.640
Let's all just put our ghosts on the table. No, I've seen no ghosts. I also ain't afraid of no ghosts. Okay

10:02.640 --> 10:08.040
But but I do I do have a certain belief

10:08.600 --> 10:16.160
That that not in ghosts but that like if something really tragic or like really horrific happens in a place that there is like

10:16.480 --> 10:20.760
Really bad juju there. I mean like if you have you I mean

10:20.760 --> 10:25.240
I'm sure it's all purely like psychological and you're telling yourself that but like, you know

10:25.240 --> 10:32.360
You've walked into like the Moundsville Prison and like the Lincoln State Hospital that we went to in Point Pleasant

10:32.360 --> 10:34.360
Like you walk in and you're like, ooh

10:34.360 --> 10:41.540
Something bad happened here. Like is that just mean that's like, oh, but I think a lot of that's aesthetics. Yeah, that's true, too

10:42.520 --> 10:46.040
You very you very rarely like walk into a Macy's and you're like, huh?

10:46.720 --> 10:48.720
Something bad happened here

10:48.880 --> 10:50.680
Griffin where you at? You know the ghosts

10:50.680 --> 10:56.680
I don't like is that I really double don't believe in our ghosts to have repeatable behavior patterns

10:56.680 --> 11:03.560
Oh the ones are like and every night she appears on the stairs. Yeah, she stands but I live on a schedule still

11:04.760 --> 11:12.900
Yeah, I can float through anything. Yeah. No, I'm gonna go be a hedonist. Thanks. Yeah, see I'm gonna go to the babes palace

11:12.940 --> 11:14.040
Yeah

11:14.040 --> 11:18.120
I'd haunt you but I want to just like rub up against money all the money in this bank

11:18.760 --> 11:22.360
That's what always kills me about those damn hauntings shows or it's like, you know

11:22.360 --> 11:26.120
The most haunted places in New England or something. There's always like that hotel manager

11:26.120 --> 11:31.280
That's like yeah and guests have reported, you know, they always see a little girl playing with the ball on the stairs

11:31.280 --> 11:36.900
I'm like then why don't you have people there with fucking cameras and like if it's if it happens all the time

11:37.120 --> 11:40.480
Get some fucking proof or say now we made up all this bullshit

11:40.720 --> 11:47.440
There's also like I know that there's the whole deal with the electromagnetic electromagnetic fields. No, there's not that's not a deal

11:47.680 --> 11:55.200
This is true. You have electromagnetic field that is around your body. That just is true. That's science. Okay, and if you

11:55.200 --> 11:57.800
Lose a limb and take a picture

11:58.800 --> 12:04.480
Captures electromagnetic fields. It'll still show the field. Fuck you around your ghost arm. Yeah

12:05.240 --> 12:10.920
That doesn't that shit's not true Travis. Look it up. Look it up Travis. It's not true

12:10.920 --> 12:17.240
It can't possibly be it's not science Travis and maybe science and that's ghost your ghost is your electricity

12:17.760 --> 12:20.680
matter energy can't be a creator to destroy guys

12:20.680 --> 12:29.160
If you fucking die and you decompose you don't have electricity in the shape of your body just like chillin on earth

12:30.080 --> 12:35.720
So close-minded Griffin so close-minded. It's normal. It's normal minded. It's normal minded

12:35.720 --> 12:42.120
Just my mind is totally normal minded because if you fucking think about that how many people have lived on the earth like a big

12:43.120 --> 12:45.120
Ghost look around you ghosts

12:45.120 --> 12:51.400
Oh, so if you would get that that's what I'm saying. That's not you guys guys. I'm just bullshitting

12:51.400 --> 12:56.160
I don't believe in guys that feeling that you get though because you did say you get a feeling when you wonder into a place

12:56.160 --> 12:59.360
Where a murder happened there have been two trillion people

13:00.000 --> 13:06.300
Sixty trillion people that have walked the earth at any given point. Well, not at any given point on all the points put together

13:07.280 --> 13:13.520
Do you everybody there's not a square foot of this entire planet where somebody hasn't been horribly murdered

13:13.520 --> 13:16.280
You don't know that. I know that for sure

13:16.320 --> 13:22.600
Yeah, think about if you think about all the people who've ever been alive law law of large numbers. Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen

13:22.840 --> 13:28.520
Listen, listen, my counter-argument there is it's not just like somebody was killed here at some point bummer

13:28.880 --> 13:31.740
It's always played like usually and this is you know

13:31.740 --> 13:36.600
I I stated by saying that it might be purely psychological and like placebo effect

13:36.600 --> 13:42.120
But like it's usually places where it's been a big mass horrible thing happened there, you know

13:42.120 --> 13:48.000
This isn't like you walk into a house where 20 years ago someone's killed me like who people that do that are charlatans

13:48.000 --> 13:54.320
I'm saying that this is like when you walk into what used to be an asylum like it's not a pleasant place to be

13:54.320 --> 13:58.880
There's a hanging funk in the yes. Thank you a hanging funk

13:59.440 --> 14:04.280
Now I also I also have to state that one of my personal heroes is Harry Houdini

14:04.480 --> 14:07.520
Who is one of like the biggest debunkers in history?

14:07.520 --> 14:12.240
And so I don't believe in ghosts I I believe in Harry Houdini, but he died

14:12.920 --> 14:14.920
So he can't be all that great

14:15.320 --> 14:17.320
Fair enough Griffin fair enough

14:17.720 --> 14:21.000
Speaking of EMF's a lot of people turn to us for advice

14:22.080 --> 14:25.000
and and and sometimes we don't have

14:26.040 --> 14:31.600
the the exact expertise to give to them like for instance, a lot of people wanted our advice on

14:32.400 --> 14:35.200
Which ghost meter to to buy?

14:35.200 --> 14:42.960
So I cheapest one so I turned to amazon.com and dug up some some reviews of

14:43.680 --> 14:47.240
The the ghost meter EMF sensor now

14:47.240 --> 14:52.020
This is real quick you traded in your fashigi balls for I forget what you traded them in for

14:52.020 --> 14:57.720
But then you have retraded that thing in for for ghost hunting tech juicing. I was really into juicing

14:57.720 --> 15:03.160
You sorry and juice fast this week. You're really into juicing, but right now I'm into the ghost meter

15:03.160 --> 15:09.240
which if you can't if you can google this or Amazon it it is basically just a picture of

15:09.840 --> 15:11.360
a

15:11.360 --> 15:17.720
What looks like a a child's chew toy and it says the ghost meter in like

15:18.520 --> 15:20.520
sans-serif on it

15:20.680 --> 15:22.480
I've oh no, that's not good

15:22.480 --> 15:28.720
So I dug I went through the reviews of the product because I figure barring my own

15:29.600 --> 15:31.120
expertise

15:31.120 --> 15:37.540
That that I could I could pass along what a few people here have said this does this does not this does not pass my

15:37.760 --> 15:41.240
Spectral smell test us. It simply does not ring true now

15:42.000 --> 15:44.680
That oh, but there is only six left in stock

15:44.680 --> 15:49.320
So hurry so get get it get it now and you guys can see I've left you a picture there

15:49.320 --> 15:52.020
If you want to see this ghost meter is awesome

15:52.400 --> 15:57.860
It's easy to use comes with complete instructions and features the most bang for your buck

15:57.860 --> 16:02.900
They may sell more expensive meters, but more expensive meters. Does it always mean better?

16:04.140 --> 16:06.540
Yeah, in fact quite literally in this case

16:07.380 --> 16:13.620
The ghost meter is compact easy to carry and the power LED is bright enough that you could read the meter in the dark

16:13.620 --> 16:20.020
I'll buy another one when this one finally wears out and I'll recommend it to anyone joining my team of ghost hunters

16:20.020 --> 16:27.780
I would give anything for a transcript of this instruction manual

16:28.340 --> 16:33.740
Let each stick this thing in the air and if it goes up then you are touching a ghost

16:33.740 --> 16:40.060
Would you give twenty four dollars because that's what it cost to buy this thing little Egypt go society

16:40.340 --> 16:47.760
Southern Illinois paranormal investigators have field tested several EMF meters including the k2 EMF meter and the ghost meter

16:47.760 --> 16:52.580
We have come to the conclusion that the very best EMF reader for the price is the ghost meter

16:52.940 --> 16:58.820
Unlike all the other EMF meat readers on the market the ghost meter indicates EMF using three modalities

16:58.980 --> 17:05.780
Analog meter flashing LED light and sound. Oh, thank God. The sound can be turned off so that will not interfere with EVP

17:06.380 --> 17:09.260
experiments ghosts hate loud noises, I guess

17:10.380 --> 17:17.420
At the little Egypt ghost society Southern, Illinois recommend the ghost meter to ghost hunters and paranormal investigators

17:17.420 --> 17:19.740
From beginners to the most experienced

17:19.740 --> 17:26.860
I love the how they're coming at this from an angle of thriftiness because even they acknowledge like if you're gonna just

17:27.180 --> 17:33.100
Fucking waste some money on some shit. You might as well waste the smallest amount that you

17:34.380 --> 17:36.460
Exactly. That's yeah exactly

17:37.740 --> 17:38.380
All right

17:38.380 --> 17:44.620
Just to my thing is I take a quarter because that's only 25 cents and then I throw it directly in front of me

17:44.620 --> 17:52.360
If it's trajectory is interrupted by some sort of intangible entity then I will know that a ghost has happened

17:52.660 --> 17:56.980
Stupid ghost thinks you can still buy things for a quarter. So they'll try to catch it. They'll go crazy for it

17:56.980 --> 18:00.900
Well, they're stupid cuz they're like I could buy a candy bar. It's like no you can't grab it

18:01.620 --> 18:03.740
For a hundred years. Sorry, but I

18:04.300 --> 18:10.740
Ordered this ghost detector to help me determine if I was in fact experiencing paranormal activity and cannot be more pleased

18:10.740 --> 18:15.860
So I'm not what I'm home alone. I'm safe. Sometimes when I'm home alone

18:15.860 --> 18:19.440
I hear creaking in the attic and noises in the closets and garages

18:20.260 --> 18:24.440
How rich is this person? I garage or pearl garages

18:25.020 --> 18:28.140
I've been trying to convince myself for the past two years that it's just the house

18:28.860 --> 18:34.400
Settling but the creepy feelings kept occurring a friend of mine suggested I look into getting a ghost detector

18:35.700 --> 18:37.700
And I looked at them and they were

18:37.700 --> 18:46.260
a wait, oh what a friend of mine suggested I looked into getting a ghost detector and I looked at them like they were a

18:46.260 --> 18:48.260
ghost themselves

18:48.660 --> 18:55.660
Anyway, I discovered that I were and here's my short story. That's the end and the end by Stephen King

18:58.980 --> 19:00.780
Anyway

19:00.780 --> 19:07.620
Anyway, I have discovered that I do have a ghost but he or she prefers to keep to themselves and I don't have any detection

19:07.620 --> 19:13.260
The main parts of the house because bonkers when I enter the attic thus confirmation of this paranormal activity

19:13.380 --> 19:17.420
I highly recommend this if you're attempting to confirm the presence of this

19:18.860 --> 19:21.260
Okay, this is but this is the last one I want to read

19:22.100 --> 19:26.780
Real quick though. How does knowing that there are ghosts you?

19:28.380 --> 19:33.980
You live in fear because you think there's a ghost you buy the ghost meter it pings you're like, yep ghosts

19:33.980 --> 19:38.680
Cool, like now I know that they're step one of 20. Okay

19:40.500 --> 19:45.100
Justin was is the next review really good. This is yes the last review. Okay

19:46.460 --> 19:49.220
The subject is found all the ghosts

19:51.980 --> 19:55.260
Incredible I have ghosts all around me and never knew it

19:55.260 --> 19:59.380
I bought this meter as a joke for a friend and figured I'd try it to see if it did anything at all

19:59.380 --> 20:04.140
Well, I was totally surprised when I turned it on and the meter started jumping all over the place

20:04.140 --> 20:08.060
I should have known since lately. I have noticed cold spots in my house. Sure

20:08.060 --> 20:15.820
It's January but cold spots mean ghosts, right? So I've walked around my house checking on two meter each time in my house

20:15.820 --> 20:22.980
I seem to have haunted electrical wiring my switches outlets and plasma TV seem to be crammed full of spirits from the beyond

20:22.980 --> 20:30.580
Maybe that is why TV sucks so bad. I would recommend this meter to anyone with haunted electrical wiring and hope they can find their

20:30.780 --> 20:32.780
ectoplasm or hot dogs or whatever

20:36.740 --> 20:39.820
But maybe not this is why this is why I'm afraid

20:40.500 --> 20:46.500
whenever Justin gets a spark up his ass and buy some random shit on Amazon like fushigi balls is that you

20:46.620 --> 20:52.660
Would write a review one day like I bought these fushigi balls as a goof for a friend and then like six months later

20:52.660 --> 21:00.300
You're moving to Reno to do your to take your contact juggling show on the road because the thing is those those electromagnetic field

21:00.300 --> 21:07.540
Detectors pick up any electromagnetic field including electrical wiring TVs any kind of electronics hot dogs

21:07.540 --> 21:13.200
I guess I guess I barely have electromagnetic hot dogs, but like here's okay people

21:13.200 --> 21:15.740
Here's the thing about buying yourself an EMF detector

21:15.740 --> 21:20.880
The only way that you would be able to know that it didn't work is if you had a ghost sitting next to you that

21:20.880 --> 21:27.340
You knew was a ghost you held it up, and it didn't do anything it doing something doesn't prove anything at all now

21:27.340 --> 21:33.100
It proves the that things are worse than you could have possibly imagined. I don't wait. I didn't make sense

21:33.100 --> 21:37.900
It says ghost meter. Let me let me explain to you why that didn't make sense it says ghost meter on it

21:38.580 --> 21:44.420
So when it's at zero that means there's no ghosts and then when it's not on zero then

21:45.260 --> 21:50.100
There's it goes. There's at least more than zero ghosts. Yeah, so that's what I'm saying

21:50.100 --> 21:53.420
It's the only way that you would know that the product you as you have just bought sucks

21:53.620 --> 21:58.560
Is if you knew conclusively that there was a ghost and it didn't show up on your ghost meter

22:00.060 --> 22:05.180
Another fun fact about the ghost meter it comes with three folded pieces of paper

22:05.420 --> 22:10.980
The larger one has information on ghost sightings that have been made and the other two are

22:11.540 --> 22:14.260
advertisements for a special Asian health remedy

22:15.220 --> 22:16.740
Sounds legit

22:16.740 --> 22:18.740
sound about right

22:18.740 --> 22:20.740
I got the yahoo's

22:20.860 --> 22:25.860
Yeah, I have a yahoo this one is cinema by Kieran Devlin. Thanks Karen. It's by yahoo answers user

22:26.220 --> 22:31.300
milk rakers local number 227 who asks my uncle Jeffert

22:31.620 --> 22:36.460
Says his trailer park home is haunted can trailers even be haunted

22:36.460 --> 22:47.080
What kind of low-class ghost sticks around in a fifth wheel for eternity this is the right category for this question right ghosts go in spirituality

22:49.080 --> 22:51.080
I'm sorry Jeffert

22:51.280 --> 22:56.640
Jeffert is it a typo? I don't want to believe it is the best name ever

22:56.640 --> 23:00.840
I don't know why you would know listen. I'm not gonna speak ill of trailers

23:00.840 --> 23:08.200
No, I've been in trailers before though, and I know that they are not known for their massive amounts of square footage

23:08.320 --> 23:12.340
Yeah, it seems to me if you had a ghost in your trailer. You know it

23:12.360 --> 23:18.920
Yeah, I know it pretty conclusively because you look up and see to the other end of your home. Yeah, there's literally it goes

23:18.920 --> 23:25.100
Yeah, it's there's nothing there is no periphery in a trailer. Mm-hmm. You see everything all over the time

23:25.100 --> 23:30.540
I think it's I think it's I think it's definitely haunted

23:31.900 --> 23:34.720
Wait what I think it's definitely a haunted

23:35.380 --> 23:41.580
You think the trailer is haunted. I think Jeffert's trailer has a real bad ghost situation

23:41.580 --> 23:47.540
I think the problem with Jeffert is his heart seems to open the paranormal

23:47.540 --> 23:53.980
I think you have to guard yourself against that or because that's how the devil gets in that's that was the problem

23:53.980 --> 23:59.300
I think that's why we're probably so obsessed with ghosts is growing up in the Baptist Church. You were told that

24:00.060 --> 24:02.740
It was where this sort of this weird double standard that

24:03.980 --> 24:05.740
Ghosts don't exist

24:05.740 --> 24:08.880
But if you start thinking about ghosts and stuff

24:09.220 --> 24:14.460
Then Satan can use that as a way to trick you to get ghosts up in there to get ghosts up in there

24:14.540 --> 24:18.780
Right exactly possessed suddenly you're possessed, so you didn't know what happened

24:18.780 --> 24:25.740
Um do you guys straight up if you feel like you or anyone you know and love is possessed get him to the doc

24:25.740 --> 24:27.740
Yes, see something say something

24:28.140 --> 24:30.140
checked early and often

24:30.380 --> 24:32.260
Do you think I?

24:32.260 --> 24:38.180
Mean there probably are we're probably not on on point earlier when we're talking about how ghosts

24:38.460 --> 24:46.580
Go to live in the dopest situation they can float into I imagine it goes like regular people like living people

24:46.580 --> 24:52.400
They have different wants and needs and desires and maybe some ghosts are like Jeffert

24:52.400 --> 24:57.560
And they they you know they appreciate the the coziness of a bagel

24:58.360 --> 25:01.340
So you're saying like maybe this is like the ghost of Jeffert senior

25:04.560 --> 25:08.960
I like you here. I feel comfortable here. I can I know this fight. This is where my armchair is

25:08.960 --> 25:11.440
I get to watch my son dip. I love it

25:11.440 --> 25:16.440
I've buried a skull in the front yard, and I can't go until you find my secret skull stash

25:19.160 --> 25:25.040
Why do you know Griffin I'm curious in the in the fiction you've stitched together not fiction go on though

25:25.680 --> 25:29.320
Why does Jeffert bury the skull what is Jeff?

25:29.320 --> 25:36.680
I didn't Jeffert's dead dad buried his secret skull stash yeah effort senior the elder Jeffert mm-hmm the elder Jeff the elder

25:37.000 --> 25:40.440
Elder Jeffert buried his secrets to skull stash in the yard

25:40.440 --> 25:46.400
And it's it's guys. It's enormous. It's a repository of sweet tobacco

25:47.280 --> 25:54.220
We're talking about hundreds of dollars worth of skull, and he can't leave this earth until Jeffert finds it

25:55.340 --> 26:00.440
So is Jeff so when we're talking have you guys seen no country for old men. It's basically this

26:00.560 --> 26:04.040
This is what I'm describing to you. Mm-hmm is the sequel

26:05.540 --> 26:07.540
Skull buddies

26:07.620 --> 26:09.620
Skull hunters

26:09.620 --> 26:14.280
That that would be a pretty good plot for a new city slickers movie

26:18.140 --> 26:22.060
The legend of Jeffert seniors the elder Jeffert's skull

26:23.260 --> 26:28.540
I'd watch that hey, so long who answers user Emmy eight seven five and

26:29.540 --> 26:34.460
Some other shit. I think eight seven five zero said that ghosts can attach themselves to anyone or anything

26:34.460 --> 26:40.680
Anything they could have died on the land or a road nearby and claim that trailer home doesn't that fucking suck

26:41.640 --> 26:45.000
That's fucking if it was me, and I died

26:45.860 --> 26:49.520
Like I would I would be like careening towards the 18-wheeler

26:49.520 --> 26:54.760
I would get Google Maps out real quick and just be like where am I gonna fucking ah god damn it I?

26:56.680 --> 27:03.240
Couldn't like careening off the Hollywood Hills and like fucking chill with Will Smith for the rest of eternity. That's just great

27:03.240 --> 27:05.240
Good

27:05.700 --> 27:11.840
They it's the person saying that like as they're driving past this place they died and that's how it happened

27:11.840 --> 27:16.160
That's how it happened you go to the nearest residence the nearest hauntable thing

27:17.120 --> 27:21.760
This is why you guys if you're gonna get murdered have a conversation with your murderer first

27:21.760 --> 27:25.000
Yeah, like maybe try to negotiate the spa, right?

27:25.680 --> 27:30.040
Don't let him kill you like in the middle of like a downtown sketchy place

27:30.040 --> 27:35.680
If you can get like a realtor to go along with the murderer just to like show off a few

27:36.000 --> 27:41.280
Places and how it would be good for ghosts. I actually have a living murder will

27:41.920 --> 27:45.040
It's a legally binding document. It took a while to set up

27:45.040 --> 27:51.880
But basically it states that if you are going to murder me. Yeah, you need to take me to within a

27:53.760 --> 27:56.960
Hauntable distance there has to be a Starbucks nearby, and you've got

27:56.960 --> 28:03.340
God's signature of the head of the Assassin's Guild yeah, I got him to sign off on it. He agrees, so it's top-down

28:04.040 --> 28:11.240
You know it's a fish Wow yeah work. Do you guys think Wi-Fi is Wi-Fi important to ghosts do you think?

28:11.840 --> 28:15.160
Like a good strong wife like fat like real fab pipes. I

28:16.040 --> 28:18.040
Think it becomes hard to distinguish

28:19.320 --> 28:25.240
Yourself from the Wi-Fi signal. I think that at some point the ghost just like Johnny mnemonic. That's a good plug Dan

28:25.240 --> 28:30.920
Yeah, if it's yeah, but can you imagine like the problem that old people have like figuring out new technology?

28:30.920 --> 28:35.360
Can you imagine being like a ghost in like a thousand years from now and trying to cope with like the new?

28:36.160 --> 28:39.320
Technological developments, and you're like whoa whoa what is this back in my day?

28:39.320 --> 28:41.960
I just floated in the pipes and carried myself around the internet

28:42.520 --> 28:47.000
If I get fucking stuck haunting someplace for a thousand years

28:47.000 --> 28:51.480
I'll be livid those those local kids should solve my puzzle by then

28:51.480 --> 28:56.840
I mean, okay, so Justin Griffin if you die right now with your unfinished business

28:56.840 --> 29:01.880
That's gonna keep you around as it goes cuz mine is I haven't finished watching walking dead yet

29:01.880 --> 29:05.480
I just I just gotta clear out my internet history gotta

29:06.240 --> 29:10.920
Blast blast my cash. What did you hear that blast my cash?

29:12.480 --> 29:18.480
Please I try to go incognito, but sometimes I forget blast my cash

29:18.480 --> 29:20.480
I

29:23.480 --> 29:26.560
Sound like it's telling us to review his cash no

29:27.040 --> 29:32.300
Press ctrl H. Check all the boxes and go set me free blast my cash

29:32.300 --> 29:43.780
Shrink the window down in case some words show up that don't you see please

29:51.460 --> 29:53.460
I am I actually

29:54.420 --> 29:58.360
Need to master the fushigi, but I'm gonna need human hands to do it

29:58.360 --> 30:02.160
If someone need a willing host a sort of whoopee Goldberg situation. Oh

30:02.720 --> 30:04.640
where I can them

30:04.640 --> 30:06.640
through her hands

30:06.680 --> 30:12.480
Master the ancient art of contact juggling who who do you think of the two people on this call?

30:13.120 --> 30:15.040
you would

30:15.040 --> 30:17.480
Prefer I don't want to put you in an uncomfortable place

30:17.480 --> 30:25.040
But like to possess between the two of us Travis has larger hands. Yeah, but I think there's a better chance of

30:25.560 --> 30:27.360
Travis losing interest

30:27.360 --> 30:32.080
That's a good if he knows that my very eternal damnation hangs in the balance

30:32.080 --> 30:34.840
I think Travis will try for a few hours and then just kind of blow it up

30:34.920 --> 30:40.520
You also would then have to like just fully live through all like the horrible stuff that I do every day. Yeah

30:42.400 --> 30:47.040
Just awful I have crooked middle fingers and I don't think that that lenses on the fushigi

30:47.040 --> 30:50.720
It's the same reason why I couldn't do those little skateboards that you do with your hands, you know

30:50.720 --> 30:53.960
Those things flip sure flip decks flip to flip decks

30:53.960 --> 30:57.420
Hey, I got a question for the longest time. I've been a person of logic and as such

30:58.300 --> 31:03.100
I've always thought the people around me were complete idiots for believing things like ghosts spirits

31:03.900 --> 31:05.900
Spiritual energy and karma

31:05.900 --> 31:11.780
How can I put aside my judgy feelings to put on an empathetic smile for people who get swept away in the magic?

31:11.780 --> 31:16.500
Okay, I somehow be convinced that this stuff is plausible. That's my shrunks. I

31:17.700 --> 31:19.700
would first like to say that

31:19.700 --> 31:26.780
Um, you probably shouldn't like lump karma in there with ghosts. Yeah. Yeah

31:28.460 --> 31:35.060
Mostly because that's that's like a religious thing, you know, hey, what's the deal with a ghost and karma and shit? Yeah

31:36.820 --> 31:39.740
Jesus and all that all that jazz

31:40.380 --> 31:44.980
You know, I literally okay. So yesterday Teresa and I we've been watching all these weird like

31:44.980 --> 31:52.980
Documentaries as I was narrated by Linda Nimoy. We were watching one about witches and like I had this moment where I looked

31:52.980 --> 31:59.180
I was like, do you ever think like it's so easy to be like, well, of course, this isn't real. This is stupid but like

32:00.620 --> 32:06.240
Maybe maybe you know, maybe one day like you'll be sitting there and be like, what? Oh

32:07.020 --> 32:13.080
Maybe that's possible and I've just never really opened my mind to it. No, no, that's dumb. That's dumb. That's dumb. Yes

32:13.080 --> 32:14.160
you're

32:14.160 --> 32:19.840
Hold on. So you're talking about how you let you open yourself up to these ideas of maybe being

32:20.640 --> 32:24.000
Being real. I'm just saying like it's it's very easy

32:24.760 --> 32:28.480
To be like no quite like okay. Let's look at it from a different way having nothing to do with ghosts

32:28.480 --> 32:32.160
Think of like aliens. It's very easy to be like, of course, there's no aliens

32:32.160 --> 32:35.200
That's stupid or if there were we would have seen him by now blah blah blah

32:35.200 --> 32:39.000
And then like a hundred years from now we find aliens. It's like well

32:39.000 --> 32:44.680
It was really easy a hundred years ago to say that wasn't it dumbasses? Yeah, but that's you gotta go with what you got to

32:44.680 --> 32:52.000
Go on and I ain't seen a ghost to on a trill people walking the earth for it through through the fullness of time. No

32:52.800 --> 33:00.240
Ghosts recorded proper no proper ghost recorded footage like what you're saying is like you can't you can't retrospective

33:00.240 --> 33:01.580
You can't look back at him like yeah

33:01.580 --> 33:06.440
It was really easy to dismiss the idea of tiny bacteria causing disease because we couldn't see him yet

33:06.440 --> 33:10.200
Yeah, because you didn't have that information. I what I'm mostly saying is

33:11.640 --> 33:16.760
Fucking let's all enjoy these witch free times that we have now because one day we might not be so lucky

33:16.760 --> 33:19.580
It might be incantations and shit going around like crazy

33:19.580 --> 33:21.560
Oh, and then we'll think back and be like

33:21.560 --> 33:25.200
do you remember when we used to watch that movie the witches with Angelica Houston and

33:25.880 --> 33:31.280

37:56.780 --> 37:58.920
amazingly wide variety of items

37:58.920 --> 38:05.060
But for me, it might as well think we have any any listeners still at this point that like Kira's job extreme restraints

38:05.060 --> 38:11.700
They're like extreme restraints. What's that? What's that be? This is peculiar. This is a sex flesh. Sammy doll

39:25.320 --> 39:30.720

It's it's all stars. It's like it's a no star. It's beautiful. I don't know

39:37.360 --> 39:44.360
What this is is this it looks it looks like there's like a buckle in there. It looks like a scene from Solaris

39:44.360 --> 39:47.760
It's it's it's horrifying. I can't figure out what they're showing me

39:47.760 --> 39:51.640
The weird thing is I want a scene from inner space. I want to put my dick in it

39:51.640 --> 39:56.120
Yeah, I got a weird thing about it. Gotta shove gotta show what I know what that glow is

40:52.760 --> 40:56.520
This one was sent in by Steve Lewis, thanks Steve it's by a high school

40:56.520 --> 40:58.520
musical lover

40:59.200 --> 41:01.200
Who asks?

41:01.800 --> 41:04.400
How do I become a ghost without dying

41:06.040 --> 41:12.100
Hmm I want to become a ghost to creep out my friends, but I do not want to die because that might hurt any suggestions

41:14.920 --> 41:22.620
You know, this is the problem we use today no commitment yeah, no pain no gain no dead no ghost powers

41:22.620 --> 41:27.240
Is it if you want to freak out your friends that bad you're gonna have to die

41:27.780 --> 41:33.420
Hey, do you want to know a great internal geek test if you heard this question you thought oh you should look into astral projection

41:33.420 --> 41:40.700
You're a nerd and I know I thought that so I did too. Okay. Um, I was gonna suggest it

41:40.700 --> 41:43.220
I'm glad you got to it before I did so I didn't embarrass myself. I

41:43.220 --> 41:51.860
I can you heart I mean, okay. Here's the thing though. You can harness the power of ghosts

41:52.460 --> 41:59.660
By just being quiet and every once in a while knocking something over when someone's not in the room

41:59.900 --> 42:01.900
There's one ghost power there

42:02.260 --> 42:05.360
Second ghost power you wait till someone is okay

42:05.360 --> 42:10.200
You wait in an adjacent room while someone's drinking a beverage you wait till they turn their head

42:10.200 --> 42:15.560
When they turn your head you sneak into the room you slap the glass across the room and then you get out of the room

42:15.560 --> 42:20.560
Right away ghosts. Okay ghosts are there you go up into a room that no one else is in you go

42:24.240 --> 42:29.060
There there's the ghost sounds so you're a ghost is an onomatopoeia. Yeah

42:30.840 --> 42:38.280
That is the salad goes so go into the house of a very very stupid person while they're like the stupidest the dumbest person

42:38.280 --> 42:44.400
The dumbest person you can find on the internet and you get some symbols while they're sleeping and you crash them over their head

42:44.400 --> 42:47.660
And then you yell I'm not real and then you leave the room

42:49.160 --> 42:54.960
Consider yourself to be fair. I think that that trick works out of context of ghosts or not. Mm-hmm

42:54.960 --> 43:00.800
Just scream. I'm not real and run out of the room. You're the only one that can see me. Don't call the cops

43:00.800 --> 43:06.600
Oh, why not just do that? Oh my god stupidest friend and welcome like I was killed today

43:06.600 --> 43:09.720
I'm a ghost. No one else can see me. Don't tell anyone. I'm here

43:09.720 --> 43:13.040
I need you to blow a few tens that some close friends haven't come by

43:14.080 --> 43:19.600
Like Jimmy's right there. You can't see Jimmy and they're like what no and all the while they got that sweet tenor

43:19.600 --> 43:23.960
He died he died today. Let's check out his browsing history. But wait, I feel like

43:25.720 --> 43:29.400
He drew a message in the mud blast my cat

43:29.400 --> 43:35.840
I don't understand. Did he go geocaching? What's he talking about? Oh

43:38.040 --> 43:42.920
Wouldn't that be horrible if that was your unfinished business like you had one last geocache you couldn't find

43:43.920 --> 43:48.240
That would be that would be horrible if that was your finished or concurrent business

43:50.760 --> 43:54.920
Can I read the best Yahoo answer response I've ever seen on the platform

43:54.920 --> 43:59.760

Just kidding with you. However, as you grow and mature your goals and thoughts will change

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
God

44:31.120 --> 44:36.080
Didn't you know you're a ghost are your friends you guys listen just playing listen before I need you to know

44:36.080 --> 44:42.520
No, no serious that you can actually tell the moment in that response when the person turns their chair around and straddles it

44:42.520 --> 44:45.080
Hey, let's get real talk. Let's get it up

44:45.080 --> 44:48.360
We've all had a lot of fun today pretending that everyone you know is dead

44:48.360 --> 44:53.640
So let's talk about how you're gonna grow up and change. Let's rap. Let's rap listen

44:53.640 --> 44:56.720
Your school brought me in today to talk to you guys about the fact that you're done

44:57.480 --> 45:01.760
Do you guys want to see me play some stunt volleyball and talk to you about drugs?

45:03.280 --> 45:07.360
Also all your friends are dead not really cuz I just sunk this basketball shot

45:07.360 --> 45:11.160
But now let me tell you about how you're all gonna grow up and not be so stupid 85 people

45:11.160 --> 45:16.280
I will stunt basketball against them solo you're gonna love this, but you shouldn't love heroin to take it from me

45:16.280 --> 45:20.400
I used to do heroin, so I got so good. Oh, I'm a motivational ghost

45:20.840 --> 45:22.840
You and all your friends do drugs

45:23.000 --> 45:29.760
But please don't and don't commit suicide and now I'm going to tear this phone book in half with only the power of Christ

45:35.520 --> 45:42.580
It's ironic if you're if you are telling people not to kill himself why make it watch you do your tricks is really a zero-sum game

45:42.580 --> 45:50.340
If you were fast you're gonna reset back to one if you were dead you couldn't see me throw this frisbee across his football field

45:53.500 --> 45:55.740
I got a cannon that shoots marshmallows

45:56.820 --> 45:59.780
Please don't tell your parents about this now. Why should you do all these push-ups?

45:59.780 --> 46:06.580
So I tell you not to kill your friends guys my supervisor at work spends a fair amount of time of her weekends doing what?

46:06.580 --> 46:08.520
She refers to his paranormal

46:08.520 --> 46:15.860
Investigating I can tell she's deeply into it because she frequently listens to shows episodes of shows like ghost hunters at our semi

46:15.860 --> 46:20.840
Boring office job and misses out on social gatherings to spend time in allegedly haunted buildings

46:20.840 --> 46:25.980
I don't feel comfortable telling someone who is one step removed from my boss that something

46:25.980 --> 46:28.980
She spends her free time engaged in is totally BS

46:29.260 --> 46:35.900
But I also feel it's a disservice to reality to allow her to continue believing such a delusion. How would you tackle the situation?

46:35.900 --> 46:38.980
That's from bemused in Boise, Idaho

46:39.340 --> 46:46.100
We've had a lot of fun here today guys, but can I get serious for a second? Yeah, what is you don't owe reality?

46:46.900 --> 46:48.260
Anything? Yeah

46:48.260 --> 46:51.660
Let this person how much let me put it this you this way

46:52.300 --> 46:54.300
How much better is your life?

46:54.980 --> 47:02.180
Knowing there is someone you come into contact with who is like deeply into paranormal investigation. The answer is a

47:02.180 --> 47:07.660
Hundred a hundred times better my life's better just from having heard you tell me about it

47:07.900 --> 47:10.780
Because here's the thing there's there's shit that we all do, you know

47:10.780 --> 47:13.300
Maybe it's not to the scale and it's not a delusional thing

47:13.300 --> 47:16.820
But that's like saying to someone like you spend too much time reading your books

47:16.820 --> 47:20.740
Like it's just what this person is into it's not affecting you in any I want to believe

47:22.380 --> 47:28.660
Right, I think no I used to want to believe and I think that is is I miss those times

47:28.660 --> 47:34.460
I miss those times. There's like ghosts. Maybe I'm in college. These are things that I would say out loud

47:35.020 --> 47:41.100
I'm in college. I'm exploring my spirituality if there's any ghosts around I want them to know it's Occam's razor guys

47:41.100 --> 47:43.300
It's ghosts. It just makes sense. I

47:44.100 --> 47:50.220
Miss those days those sweet doe eyed days not the days when you believe but the days when you wanted the days that I

47:50.340 --> 47:55.700
Possessed it you want to want to believe now. It's like I'm I am way too busy for that

47:55.700 --> 47:58.780
I have way too much on my adult plate. I

47:59.580 --> 48:05.180
Think that wanting to tell your boss like hey what you're doing is stupid is akin to like I can't believe these stupid kids

48:05.180 --> 48:07.180
believe in in Santa Claus like

48:07.740 --> 48:14.660
Leave your boss alone. Also, it is I think super mean to this role of a bike this thing you believe in. It's stupid

48:14.660 --> 48:21.660
Yeah, yes, I'm out. And also do you think that your boss is like has not heard that from anyone before and she's gonna pick?

48:21.660 --> 48:27.180
Oh, oh, I suddenly open my eyes. I didn't even consider the possibility

48:27.180 --> 48:31.460
She may be living in an Emperor's New Clothes situation where no one has actually

48:32.420 --> 48:34.740
pointed out the fact that ghosts aren't real or

48:35.820 --> 48:39.140
Unless she's embezzling from the company to buy her ghost meters

48:39.540 --> 48:41.500
maybe her

48:41.500 --> 48:44.100
she has a very strained relationship with her son and

48:44.620 --> 48:49.540
The only way that she copes with it or perhaps stays close to him is hunting ghosts with him

48:49.540 --> 48:51.540
Because he's a ghost. Oh

48:52.420 --> 48:55.540
Oh my god, how do you feel now?

48:57.140 --> 49:02.020
You are listening to this episode and you are not sufficiently spooked you are not paying attention

49:02.580 --> 49:08.740
You just got shivered. Sorry, you just got shivered the calls coming from inside the house

49:10.220 --> 49:13.640
The podcast what had been dead for 30 years

49:15.100 --> 49:17.100
What do you think about that?

49:17.100 --> 49:22.060
Fred and I bet there's someone listening the show named Fred and they're like, oh fuck. Oh fuck

49:22.700 --> 49:28.080
You they got me good. They shivered me when I least expected it. That's when it always happens Fred

49:29.940 --> 49:32.900
Okay, I draw a webcomic I know I know

49:33.580 --> 49:34.900
lame

49:34.900 --> 49:42.260
Not lame. That's not lame. That's not editorial from web. Yeah webcomics are like are like 80% of our demographic

49:42.260 --> 49:47.100
We have to keep our webcomic artists. Happy. I would rather alienate white people at this point

49:48.820 --> 49:55.740
White college-aged males, I would rather alienate 18 to 24 college-aged males with podcasts addiction

49:57.260 --> 50:02.500
Can we start reviewing our favorite way calm tablets I feel like this I feel like that would be a good expenditure

50:03.060 --> 50:09.580
That would be a good way to spend our time. Anyway about it's about ghost hunting and bounty hunters and it's called wait for it bounty

50:09.580 --> 50:10.740
hunters

50:10.740 --> 50:16.220
Now I myself am a skeptic don't buy into the whole. Oh god. I don't know what it was

50:16.220 --> 50:20.820
Therefore it must be a dead guy thing, but I love ghost stories. My question is this

50:20.940 --> 50:24.140
What's the scariest place for a ghost to show up?

50:24.140 --> 50:30.340
And what would you do if you saw one in said location in drawing the comic?

50:30.340 --> 50:34.600
I have idea after idea that come up with but then I decided that it's to Scooby-Doo

50:35.180 --> 50:38.260
Them parks museums hospitals theme parks

50:38.260 --> 50:40.260
Man them parks

50:42.140 --> 50:47.020
Where would the back brothers back right most not want to meet up with a scary

50:47.540 --> 50:50.740
Boo-boo and or what is your favorite ghost story?

50:50.740 --> 50:51.100
Okay

50:51.100 --> 50:55.900
I want to limit this to the first part of this question because I can't tell you my favorite ghost story because it is dirty

50:55.900 --> 50:57.900
and racist

50:57.900 --> 51:06.340
There's like a whole like 10-minute spiel about Obamacare you wouldn't yeah, it gets raw in there

51:08.700 --> 51:10.940
Charlie Daniels is the protagonist. Let me leave

51:12.060 --> 51:19.900
I'll tell you where I don't want to ghost to appear. Okay, sometimes I'm in a long room or hallway and

51:20.340 --> 51:25.380
I will I will not turn the lights on on one end because I'm just gonna be

51:25.380 --> 51:32.140
Walking through and about halfway through I will regret it cuz it's dark

51:32.140 --> 51:32.620
Yeah

51:32.620 --> 51:39.020
And I'll get like so so pooped like way pooped out and then when you say that

51:39.020 --> 51:43.940
Do you literally mean so scared that you've defecate like so scared?

51:43.940 --> 51:46.940
No, I mean like I'm a grown man, but I would pee pants. I

51:47.980 --> 51:53.020
Get so scared you guys ever do that. You're like a lot a dark hallway or something all the time

51:53.020 --> 52:00.900
Like oh shit. Oh shit. I know it. I know it's on I'm routinely going into warehouses and like old shops and stuff

52:00.900 --> 52:03.620
Yes, I I do that. That's how you guys the other place

52:03.620 --> 52:08.900
I just thought of this way better that you definitely don't want to see it goes. Yeah at the bottom of a pool. Oh

52:09.460 --> 52:11.460
No, no, no

52:13.340 --> 52:15.520
Down with your mouth goes like

52:17.820 --> 52:19.820
No

52:19.820 --> 52:25.180
Okay, you reach the bottom level of a building the elevated doors open ghost

52:25.980 --> 52:28.580
Right there in front of the elevator. Let me get you at this

52:28.580 --> 52:32.420
It's an opening night of a movie midnight movie and you just waited in line

52:32.420 --> 52:37.380
You get a big tub of popcorn and you get it and it takes you 20 minutes to get it and you paid

52:37.780 --> 52:40.580
$8 for it, right, you know

52:42.380 --> 52:44.940
Take it back to your seat and you got to work your way through the aisle

52:44.940 --> 52:51.300
Like excuse me, excuse me, and then you get back to your seat and you look down and it's not popcorn. It's just a ghost

52:52.860 --> 52:55.780
Man you that you have to go all the way back

52:55.780 --> 52:59.740
Go back and you have to wait in line for 20 minutes because they can't let you skip and you get there

52:59.740 --> 53:04.940
You're like, uh, excuse me. You gave me a ghost and then they say no I didn't and you look down and it's you look

53:04.940 --> 53:06.940
Down and it's popcorn

53:08.140 --> 53:09.460
Shivered

53:09.460 --> 53:13.900
Shivered I'm fully shivered at this. Okay, imagine this you've been waiting for a new car. All right

53:13.900 --> 53:17.620
I love it shopped around. Okay, you've gone through all the different financing options

53:17.620 --> 53:19.980
You weren't sure at first because you wanted like a two-door

53:19.980 --> 53:23.140
But then they started showing you the four doors and you're really happy with one of them

53:23.140 --> 53:26.700
And so it's been months. You got all your financing in order you pick the right colors

53:26.700 --> 53:30.260
You know the car you want you buy it as you're driving off the lot

53:30.260 --> 53:36.380
You open the glove compartment ghost check this out. Check this spooky story. You wait in line at Starbucks

53:36.740 --> 53:43.260
You're waiting and waiting waiting and then you wait and then you wait and then you get to the front and you say I want

53:43.260 --> 53:44.340
a

53:44.340 --> 53:48.300
grande salted caramel mocha and a benty skinny salted caramel mocha and

53:49.220 --> 53:52.700
oatmeal with brown sugar and nuts and pumpkin bread and

53:53.340 --> 53:56.700
Pumpkin muffin and then you reach and then he says it's gonna be

53:56.980 --> 54:01.700
1978 and you reach in your pocket and to get your wallet, but what's in there is actually a ghost

54:01.700 --> 54:04.380
Oh my god, I guess flip my popcorn over

54:04.380 --> 54:06.300
You just got shamed

54:06.300 --> 54:11.140
But this one you go to a party and because your friends say that you're gonna know a bunch of people there

54:11.140 --> 54:13.740
And you get to it and you don't actually know

54:14.340 --> 54:18.460
You don't actually know that many people there and then maybe there's a ghost or something

54:20.380 --> 54:26.140
Imagine this, okay. So like you've been marinating like this roast in your crock pot for like, let's say like 20 hours

54:26.140 --> 54:27.940
It's like a real slow roast, right? Oh my god

54:27.940 --> 54:32.500
And you've been building up cuz you're gonna have a dinner party that okay, right and then you open the crock pot

54:32.500 --> 54:41.760
And you didn't put enough liquids in and now the whole thing's dried out and suddenly the doorbell rings and you open and there's a ghost

54:41.760 --> 54:46.900
