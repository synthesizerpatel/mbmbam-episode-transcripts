I'm the other guy Travis McElroy

00:58.160 --> 01:04.000
I'm the Queen Latifah of podcasting Griffin McElroy. Don't you claim that like you can just

01:04.000 --> 01:11.680
Hog that for yourself. I'm gonna take it. You guys can you guys can be your your own soul mistresses, but I call Erica Badiou

01:12.880 --> 01:19.440
That's a good one. All right, Justin. What do you think in Macy Gray? I try to say goodbye, but we just started the show

01:20.960 --> 01:26.160
So here's our first question that comes to us from Austin via gmail

01:26.880 --> 01:28.320
He says hey guys

01:28.320 --> 01:33.480
Do girls find it attractive if you listen to certain types of music or maybe a certain artist if so

01:33.480 --> 01:36.200
Which ones do you think they like? Thanks for your time. Ah

01:37.720 --> 01:39.720
Wow, what a bummer way to start off

01:41.200 --> 01:43.200
The shit out of me dude

01:43.360 --> 01:47.080
it's sad that that you have to ask this question because

01:48.600 --> 01:54.640
It's doubly sad that the answer is of course. Yeah, of course there are I I think

01:55.440 --> 01:58.160
It all depends on the type of girl. You're trying to woo

01:59.240 --> 02:01.240
if she's a more

02:01.240 --> 02:05.800
Let's say common type you'll want to listen to the mainstream artists of the day

02:05.800 --> 02:10.560
You're you're Justin Bieber's you're you're nickel backs

02:11.560 --> 02:17.200
If if she's a little like she if she if she's in the smart dudes gotta go jazz

02:17.480 --> 02:19.640
If you have a working knowledge of jazz

02:20.400 --> 02:24.240
Then then you're gonna be able to bring in those those smart girls

02:25.200 --> 02:27.880
She's a little more tender go with like some

02:27.880 --> 02:34.640
Damien rice something like that is very good. You guys have any suggestions zydeco zydeco

02:37.360 --> 02:41.620
Beat no one can resist nothing but zydeco zydeco

02:43.520 --> 02:46.720
Watch out for being too eager to say oh, yeah

02:46.720 --> 02:52.080
I'd love them too because now you have to go to their concerts and they're awful like Nickelback if you're like, yeah, baby

02:52.080 --> 02:53.600
I love Nickelback too

02:53.600 --> 02:57.920
Man, now you're locked into that and then halfway through the concert should be like, I'm sorry

02:57.920 --> 03:02.280
I have to tell you I know you love them, but these guys are terrible and you like I think they're terrible

03:02.680 --> 03:04.680
Let's leave

03:05.320 --> 03:07.320
Let's go have premarital sex

03:08.520 --> 03:11.200
You won't have that problem though if you're at a zydeco concert

03:11.400 --> 03:16.400
yep, just turn on the the soundtrack to divine secrets of the Aya sisterhood and

03:16.400 --> 03:19.040
And that

03:21.000 --> 03:26.520
Heavily zydeco inspired. It's heavily zydeco inspired. Yeah, it's it's heavy on zydeco

03:28.160 --> 03:29.440
I

03:29.440 --> 03:31.440
Guess we answer the question. I don't know

03:33.080 --> 03:35.080
Yeah, it depends on what the it

03:36.240 --> 03:44.040
It always is about what the the person likes try to strike a balance between what they like and what you think they would like

03:44.040 --> 03:46.040
I

03:46.200 --> 03:47.720
Here's a suggestion

03:47.720 --> 03:49.720
Girls like guys with self-respect

03:49.920 --> 03:56.080
Yeah confident guys don't like what you like dude and they'll respect that be able to look at yourself with a mirror Austin

03:57.400 --> 03:59.920
I'm currently seeing a girl

04:01.120 --> 04:05.680
You should talk to her. So listen our podcast. I mean you're seeing a girl

04:06.440 --> 04:13.200
Relationship-wise who used to date a good friend of mine. I really like this girl. She's funny and beautiful and

04:13.200 --> 04:17.480
Now not only does my friend not liking me. He wants to fight me

04:17.480 --> 04:23.100
I know I could take him if it came down to it. What do I do? Okay, Morgan

04:25.040 --> 04:26.960
This fight is over

04:26.960 --> 04:28.880
Johnny it's over

04:28.880 --> 04:35.560
He lost you don't need to fight him. He lost in the sense that you're now dating his girlfriend

04:36.120 --> 04:38.120
But he could still win

04:38.120 --> 04:45.040
In a physical match. That's what I'm saying. I I think the real question here is what kind of time frame

04:45.040 --> 04:49.920
We're looking at when you say he used to date her like he used to date her yesterday

04:53.680 --> 05:01.760
Yeah, but no, I think the real question is how bigger is pythons if we're talking like a 20-inch Python what caliber gun he's got

05:01.760 --> 05:06.740
Yeah, I what I'm saying is you this is a lose-lose situation for you. I mean

05:06.740 --> 05:10.420
No, no lose-lose. It's a lose

05:10.460 --> 05:15.960
It's a it's a lose-win that you don't have to enter into because if you lose this if you lose this fight

05:16.700 --> 05:23.340
Then this dude gets to look beef in front of his ex-lady and maybe you'll lose her to him. It's very primal

05:23.340 --> 05:28.140
It's oh, it's a biological nose. He knows he could take him if it came down to it

05:28.140 --> 05:28.940
Oh

05:28.940 --> 05:29.980
That's mind

05:29.980 --> 05:36.180
Does he know in that way that guys like myself have never been it who've never been in a real fight think that?

05:36.180 --> 05:40.940
Should they be in a real fight? They could probably beat anybody. I could take Jason Statham

05:41.380 --> 05:45.700
so find your strength and then challenge him to that like perhaps a a

05:46.820 --> 05:49.780
downhill ski race on the most dangerous mountain a

05:50.420 --> 05:52.420
game of Battleship

05:52.740 --> 05:58.000
Perhaps act like you pity him all the time. That is the only way to win just by God

05:58.180 --> 06:02.580
That's very sad. Like I know you want to fight me but like I know you miss her

06:02.580 --> 06:09.180
I'd miss her too if I lost her. Oh, that's great. Yeah, I like that a lot. It's tear him down inside out

06:10.340 --> 06:16.140
That's a you're not gonna fight him make it seem like cuz it's too beneath you. Yeah, it's like oh, that's really fake

06:16.900 --> 06:19.820
That was advocate though. You're cold playing your bro

06:20.700 --> 06:24.420
That's your bro. And and you are kind of giving him the business

06:25.180 --> 06:30.420
But all of these questions that are like a friend of mine and I did this to them or a friend of mine and they did

06:30.420 --> 06:33.580
This to me. These people aren't friends. Yeah

06:34.180 --> 06:36.180
You I feel like there's another

06:36.220 --> 06:38.540
Advice podcast out there. That's like bizarro

06:38.540 --> 06:43.840
My bim bam where the actual the people who are being transgressed upon

06:44.180 --> 06:48.180
Go like my friends dating my friend now, and I'm sad all the time

06:51.100 --> 06:54.980
It's not for winners who listen to this show yeah losers

06:54.980 --> 07:00.740
Um Griffin, you want to give us a question? Yeah, sure. How about one from Yahoo?

07:01.420 --> 07:02.660
Okay

07:02.660 --> 07:05.980
This person's name is kind of offensive. So I'm not going to read it

07:07.100 --> 07:11.020
Open question help wife dresses me in child's clothes. Oh

07:13.900 --> 07:19.340
Man help wife dresses me in child's clothes. I have all the mr. Men t-shirts

07:19.340 --> 07:25.260
I could own I look like a small child in a big body. I want a Motorhead t-shirt

07:25.260 --> 07:28.260
How to point out the subtle difference without seeming ungrateful?

07:31.540 --> 07:33.860
That is how adults dress

07:37.380 --> 07:41.220
All I can think is he must look like right after Tom Hanks

07:41.540 --> 07:45.020
Changes into the adult in big and like it's like whoa

07:45.020 --> 07:51.900
Like all of a sudden you went from being six to ballooning up to being like 35 like an adult in a Motorhead t-shirt

07:54.900 --> 07:57.940
Forget about suits and ties and button-ups

07:58.460 --> 08:06.620
There it's just when you grow up you wear more adult t-shirts like Motorhead like Motorhead or other adult themes

08:07.260 --> 08:10.460
Journey, I don't know about all this guys. I don't know

08:11.340 --> 08:13.900
maybe he maybe he lacks maybe he's like

08:13.900 --> 08:19.500
Maybe he's like John McCain. He can't dress himself because of his arms that he got broke

08:20.820 --> 08:22.700
You're thinking about don't

08:22.700 --> 08:26.860
Know McCain had it too. He had those arms that he couldn't you know

08:26.860 --> 08:30.760
That's on the Republicans do to you before they let you run for president. Yes, they hobble your shoulder

08:31.420 --> 08:35.660
Give you a kid mannequin arms. Hey, she changed your mind. We just hobbled you for life

08:38.140 --> 08:40.140
It's gonna play really well

08:40.500 --> 08:42.060
with our base

08:42.060 --> 08:50.020
Our base loves hobbled men. I just give this good guy in my brother my brother me advice and making fun of veterans a

08:51.900 --> 08:53.900
Good show this is

08:55.140 --> 09:00.060
Tristan's our boy. Yeah, he's not a vet though yet. He's still up in it. He's a vet

09:00.620 --> 09:05.180
He's an amateur. I think I don't think I don't think you're a vet until you get back and he ain't back

09:05.180 --> 09:07.180
He's still up there crushing Osama's guts

09:07.180 --> 09:13.660
I did you guys hear about the dude that like rolled up to Afghanistan with a sword and a pistol

09:14.940 --> 09:17.740
He's like I'm here to decapitate Osama bin Laden

09:18.740 --> 09:22.000
My first thought was yeah, Tristan. Yeah

09:23.940 --> 09:25.940
What

09:25.940 --> 09:27.940
My problem was they detained the guy

09:31.300 --> 09:36.380
He's the guy I want over there yeah, we want people like that over there I went over there with a

09:36.380 --> 09:42.060
boom box and some unlaced chucks and said I'm here to de-rap-i-tape

09:43.860 --> 09:46.540
I saw him bin Laden give him my funkiest beats

09:47.660 --> 09:54.140
No guys, nothing doing. Formspring someone on Formspring asked I'm on the job hunt in this tough economy and

09:54.740 --> 10:00.180
Any advice on acquiring a job would be much appreciated as well as any advice for any job interviews. Ooh

10:00.180 --> 10:03.180
Ooh, man

10:03.780 --> 10:07.540
Travis you've had about nine jobs in the past year. Why don't you yes, I have

10:08.220 --> 10:14.940
Well, the thing about applying for jobs in a tough economy is the difference between looking for a job and looking for a career

10:15.420 --> 10:18.980
Because you can get a job at like McDonald's or Walmart

10:19.620 --> 10:22.220
But that's not what most people are looking for

10:22.220 --> 10:26.380
So if you're getting to a point where you're really strapped for cash, you got to lower them standards

10:27.060 --> 10:28.540
Yeah

10:28.540 --> 10:35.580
But just apply everywhere like you never know you have options. You never know who's gonna be hiring. Yeah

10:36.780 --> 10:39.220
Job interviews goes just never break eye contact

10:41.260 --> 10:43.260
Sweat as much as possible

10:43.700 --> 10:50.780
As soon as you break eye contact you've lost it. You done fucked up. Don't forget to use your your connections, right if you got

10:51.620 --> 10:53.620
friends family whoever who are

10:53.920 --> 10:56.400
Business owners or no business owners ask if they're looking for anybody

10:56.400 --> 11:01.520
Thank you. Um, and you can always just sex your way to the top sex your way to the top

11:01.520 --> 11:05.680
I know we got this podcast hard and fast rule in job interviews

11:05.680 --> 11:11.400
And it is number one rule as someone who has interviewed a bunch and interviewed people when you go into the job

11:12.000 --> 11:18.880
Find out what the employees of that company are expected to wear every day then dress one step better than that

11:19.080 --> 11:20.000
Mm-hmm

11:20.000 --> 11:27.520
Never show up to an interview in jeans and a t-shirt never jeans never jeans never jeans are going to your boy for a retail

11:27.520 --> 11:31.000
Location where they wear like khakis and a polo wear khakis and a dress shirt

11:32.040 --> 11:35.840
Something like that so that you look like you actually care about getting the job

11:35.840 --> 11:42.080
I know it seems like a good idea to walk in stab somebody and say well, I guess you got an opening

11:42.080 --> 11:48.400
But um, it's it's not it's not a good idea it's a bad a patently bad idea

11:48.400 --> 11:51.840
That's not the kind of person they want on the team. If nothing else watch

11:52.480 --> 11:58.960
The Michael J. Fox movie. Oh, I fucked it up. What is it? The one way he does Oh back to the future

11:58.960 --> 12:00.960
That's it. Good gag

12:00.960 --> 12:02.960
the one about business

12:02.960 --> 12:04.960
gag

12:05.960 --> 12:09.480
Great great great anecdote associated question

12:09.480 --> 12:11.480
Anecdote associated question

12:12.400 --> 12:18.020
The Dan Shires asks on Twitter. Hey guys, how much is too much when bending the truth on a job application?

12:18.520 --> 12:20.900
Do you get caught bro? You will get hot

12:21.760 --> 12:23.760
No, I said till you get caught

12:24.880 --> 12:31.920
They know you will you will get caught inevitably. It depends on the job, right? Like McDonald's at Burger King. Don't talk

12:32.160 --> 12:35.120
They're not gonna like call and be like, is this guy good? Is he down?

12:35.120 --> 12:40.080
The best is the truth. That's a special skills. I

12:42.840 --> 12:44.840
Yeah

12:46.320 --> 12:47.800
You know

12:47.800 --> 12:50.920
What truth like do you want to pretend like you had a job that you didn't?

12:50.920 --> 12:57.560
I mean if you have a friend who will lie and say that that they're their manager of a closed business like

12:58.360 --> 13:00.720
Yeah, I mean you can get away at that. That's not tough

13:00.720 --> 13:05.080
but I don't know that you want to get into a job where

13:05.920 --> 13:09.540
They think you have some frame of reference that you don't have

13:10.560 --> 13:18.400
Here's my advice come up with a bullshit term for the job that you did like first shift supervisor or something

13:18.400 --> 13:20.400
But really you were just there by yourself

13:21.720 --> 13:25.600
Because nobody checks that nobody calls and says was he the first shift supervisor

13:25.600 --> 13:30.520
Just make up a job title for a job. You actually did but make it sound way more impressive

13:31.160 --> 13:36.480
I say always list that you can juggle at TCBY whenever I put that on our resume

13:36.480 --> 13:42.960
I always say that I was the chief yogurt tester when really it just meant that I sat around and ate a

13:43.200 --> 13:48.920
Bunch of free yogurt, you know, they're close now, right TCBY. Good job. Oh, that's a shame. Good job

13:48.920 --> 13:56.160
I didn't have a lot of it. How's that free yogurt now you cocksucker. It's not my body anymore

13:56.160 --> 14:02.440
I had that job a long time ago. You made me sick. Is it okay to drink alone? Yep. Ask one angry Zeus

14:04.160 --> 14:06.160
What is okay, I mean

14:06.200 --> 14:09.200
It's probably it's not okay to get drunk alone. I

14:10.080 --> 14:14.120
Don't think not on a regular basis. No, not on any basis

14:14.120 --> 14:19.600
But I think it's okay to my friend Dwight says it's not drinking alone if you're talking on the internet. I

14:23.040 --> 14:29.520
Think I think it's worse to say I want to drink I need to go get some people so I feel okay drinking

14:29.520 --> 14:35.600
I think that's more of a statement than just drinking by yourself. Why don't I I mean

14:36.120 --> 14:40.240
If you're drinking excess to get drunk by yourself, that's not good

14:40.240 --> 14:45.920
if you're like want to unwind with a beverage your grown-ass man do it I

14:46.400 --> 14:54.000
Call bevon sometimes sometimes and I there's nothing wrong with it because I enjoy a cold bev at the end of a long hot day

14:55.360 --> 14:57.360
long hot day of what

14:57.400 --> 15:02.920
Work, I'm working working. We do the same thing, right? That's what I make sure. Mm-hmm

15:03.920 --> 15:05.920
But Griffin does it in a sauna

15:05.920 --> 15:11.360
So I do it in a sauna and I do squats between every post and you don't bev at all all work

15:11.360 --> 15:14.040
I know I'd stay dry dry as a popcorn

15:15.720 --> 15:18.520
Dry as a what dry as a popcorn fart

15:23.120 --> 15:26.040
Are you getting that going or is that yeah, I'm trying to get it spinning

15:28.840 --> 15:30.960
We'll see this is really the first

15:30.960 --> 15:36.560
It's the first outing the first time I've really really brought that really limited usage

15:37.240 --> 15:41.780
No, no, no, it's it's there are a lot of occasions where it's appropriate. I am so

15:42.640 --> 15:44.800
Just now on this podcast Yahoo Answers

15:45.360 --> 15:53.640
Yahoo Answers user a 23 asks is it possible that a human turns into a monster like in the Resident Evil movie in a

15:53.760 --> 15:55.760
future

15:55.760 --> 16:03.120
There is a future in which that is possible his explanation. Okay, the big monster in the Resident Evil movie resulted from a genetic

16:03.600 --> 16:08.480
Experiment in a human being well, I mean that's just science. Yeah

16:09.120 --> 16:15.640
people are doing genetic experiments every day and one of these days they're gonna try and cure Alzheimer's and then

16:16.480 --> 16:21.600
Giant monsters gonna come out or a gentle monster or a giant intelligent shark

16:21.600 --> 16:26.120
What are there any answers to that and is there any people trying to get down on helping him out?

16:26.920 --> 16:28.920
Let's see what people said

16:29.360 --> 16:35.560
It is possible, but not likely at all. What the fuck is possible. It's possible

16:35.560 --> 16:40.740
What do you mean? It's possible that it might turn that a human might turn into a monster because the genetic experiments

16:42.240 --> 16:45.560
Yes, some of our ancestors apparently such as the

16:45.560 --> 16:53.240
Meganthropus a type of homo erectus fossils sound like some scary individuals so we could devolve into

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Giant horrifying cavemen basically

16:58.160 --> 17:01.560
But those guys seem hilarious and all they do is you know

17:02.200 --> 17:05.800
Shill car insurance not bowl. I make unfunny sitcoms

17:07.080 --> 17:13.840
Really a movie apparently a hit movie fucking kidding me soon to be hit. Are you fucking joking with me?

17:13.840 --> 17:17.460
Yeah, I'm gonna see that caveman film. I'll go see that

17:18.360 --> 17:20.360
whatever

17:20.520 --> 17:25.400
Sounds good. I'm in my early 20s and currently single my problem is that when I see an attractive girl

17:25.400 --> 17:27.400
I cannot tell how old she is

17:28.720 --> 17:32.000
Once I even started talking to girl right she was still in high school or oh

17:35.080 --> 17:37.080
Which caused me to walk away immediately

17:37.080 --> 17:40.040
Allegedly okay good. I'd like to like

17:41.040 --> 17:44.480
out out how old never mind I

17:46.280 --> 17:50.600
Just I actually just want to get my driver's license you said you're in high school get out

17:50.600 --> 17:53.720
I really don't want to be labeled to some kind of pervert

17:53.960 --> 17:59.900
If you guys have an easier way to tell the approximate age of a girl without simply walking out to her like a creeper

17:59.900 --> 18:02.600
And just flat-out asking it would be much appreciated

18:02.600 --> 18:07.320
Have you considered have you considered cutting her in half and counting her rings

18:12.200 --> 18:15.000
Or is that all you can consider you sicko

18:19.360 --> 18:25.800
Listen some people are just some people are age-blind and I I understand that it's not a problem that I have

18:25.800 --> 18:29.520
I'm like a carny with my ability to guess people's age like to the month

18:29.520 --> 18:31.520
um

18:32.320 --> 18:37.320
But yeah, I don't know what to tell you DJ because you really can't just walk up there and be like hey

18:38.880 --> 18:43.200
This this is your age. What is your age? Let me know cuz I'm let I win

18:43.200 --> 18:44.800
I may try and start something

18:44.800 --> 18:50.640
DJ I have and gas station approach where unless they look 35 assume. They're underage I

18:52.440 --> 18:56.040
Have a question if I can call you Deej um

18:56.040 --> 18:58.040
um

18:59.200 --> 19:00.680
What is your life

19:00.680 --> 19:05.960
Stra- I assume your worry is that you don't want to have sex with an underage girl cool

19:06.720 --> 19:11.920
What is going on with your life strategy that you think there's a fairly good chance

19:12.460 --> 19:17.120
You could end up boning down on a girl before you figure out what her like life

19:17.360 --> 19:23.620
Situation is like before you figure out how old she is and stuff like what kind of chicken and egg situation

19:23.620 --> 19:28.720
Do you have where that's your that's your approach also? Where are you meeting these women I?

19:30.280 --> 19:34.080
Have no idea how old you are hey Justin Bieber concert

19:34.080 --> 19:38.680
Hey, yeah, maybe don't maybe don't try and pick up chicks in the Dave and Buster's arcade room man

19:38.680 --> 19:41.480
I love chicken nugget day. Do you guys love chicken nugget day?

19:42.840 --> 19:45.360
You finish that school rule. What are you doing after this?

19:46.200 --> 19:51.080
This is such a good place to come eat. I eat here like five times a week. It seems like what about you guys?

19:51.080 --> 19:53.920
I want to get out of here. I've got cigarettes

19:55.720 --> 20:00.400
This isn't a public playground. This is it. This is oh, this is actually attached to your school

20:00.400 --> 20:04.160
So I should I shouldn't be here is what you guys like Boone's farm

20:04.720 --> 20:09.900
I'll get you some Boone's farm. Hey if that older lady gets tired of pushing you on the swing. I'm happy to

20:11.520 --> 20:18.000
On there you should look about the same age is that I'm sorry. This is a this is a mental problem

20:18.000 --> 20:21.280
I have yeah, I know it's a mental problem. You're a pedophile DJ

20:21.920 --> 20:27.560
But no wait. No DJ is a loyal my bim-bam listener. We can't be too hard on him because

20:28.520 --> 20:32.480
Girls are getting older younger. You know I mean ma'am blue members what he is

20:34.200 --> 20:40.240
Now get me J. I'm not talking about young boys though. No young girls. He just wants to get down with young girls

20:40.800 --> 20:42.920
So he's not what their manager is

20:42.920 --> 20:49.480
That's the best way to figure out if a girl is in high school versus college ask her what her major is

20:50.160 --> 20:54.280
Yeah, she will say I am in high school. She'd be like a recess

20:54.280 --> 21:00.280
I know I'm not I think I think DJ you would be helped enormously if you had a good if you had a pre-planned

21:00.480 --> 21:05.480
Exit line for if the girl told you that she went to high school like if you knew what you were gonna

21:05.480 --> 21:10.920
Do because I think that's your worry that it'll be awkward and and you just say so do you go to school?

21:10.920 --> 21:15.800
And if she says I'm in high school you say like have you considered accepting Jesus Christ as your personal?

21:16.480 --> 21:21.640
And then she'll say like what and you're like out. I was gonna say claim to be an undercover cop

21:22.880 --> 21:25.200
Do you know where I can score some ecstasy?

21:28.160 --> 21:30.160
Can you talk into my lapel

21:31.200 --> 21:39.440
What's the best way to tackle writer's block aspects pixelated pixel rave it's pixel rated pixel rated

21:39.440 --> 21:40.740
You

21:40.740 --> 21:42.740
Can't actually tackle writer's block

21:43.440 --> 21:51.040
That's that's the truth. You just get up absent. No no no no no you just have to give up on it for a little bit

21:51.040 --> 21:57.120
And then come back later when you're not as blocked, and I've never had it when I have writer's block. I just write some shit

21:58.080 --> 22:00.640
Sure, I just write shit that I've seen other people write before

22:01.680 --> 22:03.680
writers walk for three years yeah

22:03.680 --> 22:09.600
I think seriously though. I think 99% of the time if you have writer's block

22:09.640 --> 22:14.400
You're actually just burned out because you've been doing what what you've been writing too much

22:14.400 --> 22:15.880
That's a good. Yeah, that's true

22:15.880 --> 22:20.320
You got to get up and and you know go do some other things and it may feel like a waste of time

22:20.320 --> 22:22.440
But I work will improve

22:22.440 --> 22:26.520
I believe that a lot of what we think of is traditionally think was creativity is really just

22:27.080 --> 22:32.080
The the input that you take it in being sort of repurposed in your head and sort of sorting it out

22:32.080 --> 22:34.080
so take in some like

22:34.960 --> 22:36.960
Stimulating stuff like go see a

22:37.960 --> 22:41.820
movie that's a little more challenging than something you normally watch or listen to some music that

22:42.600 --> 22:48.120
You wouldn't normally listen to something kind of break your your rut and get that creative part of your brain flowing

22:48.120 --> 22:53.560
I don't even think you can I don't think you can lose creativity as much as you can lose motivation

22:53.560 --> 22:56.120
I think that's right. That's a lot of inspiration

22:56.160 --> 23:01.160
You just gotta you know get away for a little bit. Just go away take a break do something else

23:01.160 --> 23:05.740
I don't know if I'm a blank screen. I think I take a half hour break in the middle of the podcast

23:06.360 --> 23:08.360
To get my juices flowing. Thank you

23:09.120 --> 23:13.120
Yeah, here here rough edit in the middle. Let's sort of his left just like this

23:14.280 --> 23:20.420
Yeah, he usually says peace. I usually say peace. Sometimes that makes it into the final cut. Hey him a bim-bam

23:20.560 --> 23:25.720
I'm sorry. Good for you gonna read this question. Well, I was gonna read a yahoo answers question, but save it

23:25.720 --> 23:32.200
I'm saving it up save it. Hey move in BAM. So I am a nice girl and I'm having trouble meeting a nice guy

23:32.200 --> 23:38.000
I meet a lot of people but it seems for every one nice guy meet there are ten creepers hitting on me

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
What is this thing with creepers?

23:40.760 --> 23:44.680
How do I find more quality men without having to deal with so many creepers?

23:47.200 --> 23:49.200
With so many DJs

23:49.840 --> 23:53.620
Creeping around asking where I go to school and if I want to accept Jesus

23:53.620 --> 23:57.120
I like she says this I picture like a

23:57.360 --> 24:03.520
Like a house of mirrors kind of situation where she's surrounded by eleven guys and she has to pick out the one nice guy from

24:03.520 --> 24:08.560
The ten creepers. Hey, I are eleven guys hitting on you at the same time. I have a question form spring

24:09.440 --> 24:11.440
How many nice guys do you need to meet?

24:12.680 --> 24:17.960
One nice guy for every ten guys on average meeting eleven people you like one of them. How many do you want?

24:18.880 --> 24:21.520
Burning through the nice guys. You're a man eater

24:21.520 --> 24:24.000
You only need the one, you know

24:25.360 --> 24:33.280
Nice guy. You only need the one unless you're getting into some big love shenanigans. Yeah that and then by all means

24:34.280 --> 24:38.160
Just say just you know, ask them if they're a creeper if they laugh it off

24:38.160 --> 24:41.280
Then they're probably nice guy if they're like, how old are you then they're a DJ

24:42.640 --> 24:49.240
I'm just kidding or they are actually like a DJ. They are a DJ. They're a creepy DJ a creepy wedding DJ

24:49.240 --> 24:52.760
Like that guy who slapped that that poor lady's bosoms

24:54.520 --> 24:57.760
That's not gonna make any sense everybody has seen that fucking video

24:58.560 --> 25:00.560
It's the most magical video. Um

25:01.080 --> 25:02.280
but

25:02.280 --> 25:07.820
We get this question a lot and it's so alien to me because I'm so used to it the other way

25:07.920 --> 25:10.080
Yeah, right ten ladies

25:10.720 --> 25:18.380
Everyone nicely. Hey, you know great place to meet people to meet to reconnect to connect for the first time to re reconnect after

25:18.380 --> 25:20.380
You've disconnected. It's the

25:20.720 --> 25:22.600
bim-bam

25:22.600 --> 25:25.400
forum appreciation group on Facebook

25:26.080 --> 25:33.280
So go to our webpage and bmb am calm and click on our Facebook group and there's there's a lot of nice

25:34.320 --> 25:36.080
attractive people there

25:36.080 --> 25:41.760
To meet there was a there's a pretty big thread on there the love and friendship connection thread

25:41.900 --> 25:45.840
Which I had I adore and it's full. There's a lot of magic happening there

25:45.840 --> 25:50.600
But I recently noticed that somebody started his own thread that says I need a girlfriend

25:51.120 --> 25:56.480
He's taking a very a more direct approach to it and I wish him the best of luck. I like it. I

25:57.120 --> 26:03.280
Honestly, I think it's great. You know, we call that go get him go attitude. Yeah attitude

26:04.600 --> 26:09.320
Yahoo answers user. Oh, it's just an exclamation point. I'm gonna pronounce that

26:09.320 --> 26:16.660
Hmm open question ladies if you found out that Prince William quote

26:17.240 --> 26:21.440
Fancy to you and was interested in marriage. What would you say? And

26:22.120 --> 26:26.700
Why lol, how serious would you take him and would you accept please explain?

26:33.960 --> 26:35.880
I

26:35.880 --> 26:43.400
Think I would just are you asking me? I mean, I that's that's usually what we do in these. I think

26:44.760 --> 26:47.200
That it would it would be weird

26:50.040 --> 26:52.040
I would hope you'd be tender

26:52.600 --> 26:57.760
Let's quick pull do do any of us actually know who Prince William is and what he looks like

26:57.760 --> 27:04.000
He's that cute one, right? He's the one but he dressed up like a Nazi one time right in a Halloween party. I

27:04.000 --> 27:07.360
Remember seeing he's got a great sense of humor on the Sun

27:08.440 --> 27:13.400
He'd be like he'd be like cool. Blimey, Justin. I'm totally into you

27:13.400 --> 27:36.880
I think you just need to look at him and say that's not my bag, baby

27:36.880 --> 27:43.720
Yeah, all right, can we just get two more minutes of straight awesome

27:45.160 --> 27:46.880
Problem

27:46.880 --> 27:50.520
That junk on blu-ray. I gotta get that it is

27:51.800 --> 27:53.800
I trapped you

27:54.200 --> 27:55.720
$90,000

27:55.720 --> 27:58.520
Have you noticed the trend where women always end up with men?

27:58.720 --> 28:05.640
Excluding McElroy's that are less attractive than them am I just doomed to spend money on makeup and a gym membership while my significant other

28:05.640 --> 28:07.800
Has a receding hairline and computer pudge

28:08.400 --> 28:12.320
Forms yes, I can see at first. I thought this question was from a man

28:13.840 --> 28:20.920
Then it I realized it was from a woman and I took a significant turn hard. I don't know. I okay form spring. What's

28:22.080 --> 28:24.800
Forget Travis and Griffin for a second. Just you and me talking. I

28:27.600 --> 28:30.560
Think there's a good chance you're a lesbian now hear me out I

28:30.560 --> 28:37.000
Think that what I was thinking in my head is I was reading this is it was from a guy

28:37.200 --> 28:41.600
What I was gonna say is well, that's natural because you're gonna find guys more attractive

28:42.480 --> 28:45.240
Guys less attractive because you're a dude and you're into ladies

28:47.160 --> 28:53.480
But you're a lady who says that I mean if you accept the idea that most people are gonna pair off

28:54.040 --> 28:57.200
What you're saying is that most women are more attractive?

28:57.200 --> 28:59.640
than most men

29:02.600 --> 29:06.840
But that's true, yes, I'm not even saying that from from

29:07.920 --> 29:11.000
Right, but of sexual orientation. I'm saying

29:11.880 --> 29:16.840
Dudes don't give as much of a shit as ladies give about their personal appearance

29:17.360 --> 29:21.080
Leading to they're being far far more attractive women than there are men

29:21.080 --> 29:27.200
What I'm saying is that the planet is being choked by overpopulation and it is biologically

29:28.080 --> 29:33.400
Increasing the number of gay people to try to limit the population. It makes perfect biological sense

29:33.560 --> 29:39.960
We have more think that this like from an evolutionary standpoint. Didn't that make perfect sense? What a beautiful

29:40.680 --> 29:44.720
wonderful way of of of evening out the population of

29:44.720 --> 29:51.280
Of the earth. It's an increasing adoptions. Yes. Yeah, and that's nice too. Lots of babies with good homes

29:51.280 --> 29:56.480
I think it's wonderful, but you have to accept that's happening at an alarming rate. If this is this is

29:57.320 --> 29:59.320
Yucky, right?

29:59.920 --> 30:06.000
Sexy sexy right that this is happening and I think it's beautiful. I think it's I think it's wonderful

30:06.760 --> 30:10.920
I just think that you are into girls and that's good. That's fine

30:10.920 --> 30:17.160
That's fine. I think girls than do women are way more attractive than guys

30:18.160 --> 30:20.160
Actually, this is a stone fact

30:20.440 --> 30:26.080
Women are soft and nice and they smell good. Stop it. You're fucking grossing me

30:27.680 --> 30:33.400
Gross gross what gross they taste sweet

30:33.400 --> 30:40.320
I'm saying is that earth is making people gay

30:43.040 --> 30:49.920
Eventually women are gonna get sick of how every man on earth is just a hideous ago beasts like

30:50.280 --> 30:56.560
Who just fucking that does just sit on his his computer and and pick at is his dark spots

30:57.120 --> 31:00.000
his places where the Sun doesn't come and and

31:00.000 --> 31:04.760
Just gets uglier and grosser and and eventually women are just gonna be like, ah, fuck it

31:04.760 --> 31:08.080
And they're gonna give up too. And then we're just gonna be a big

31:08.920 --> 31:14.680
Stupid ugly planet of people. Well, this is the way the world ends not with a bang but with lesbians

31:15.840 --> 31:23.120
Ugly ugly lesbians. No sexy lesbians and ugly dudes beautiful sexy lesbians that can't procreate to save their lives take over

31:23.120 --> 31:25.640
Aren't they they are shit. They are

31:25.640 --> 31:28.920
There's only one generation of them. How can we make this work for us?

31:30.200 --> 31:36.360
You gotta get on board now cuz I don't wanna be the first one against the wall. I tell you what friends with the lesbians

31:36.360 --> 31:39.320
That's what I do. I'll tell you the really scary thing

31:39.320 --> 31:42.960
The really scary thing is that there's someone out there listen to this and they're like, yes

31:42.960 --> 31:46.240
They have it all figured out. They crack the code

31:46.920 --> 31:52.360
These McElroy brothers, they know what's up. They're being serious about the things they talk about. They know what's going on

31:52.360 --> 31:55.000
Hey, and then we're on our way to a Nobel Prize

31:55.000 --> 32:00.120
Nobel Prize here we go. Except the one person who thinks that is the Nobel Prize guy

32:01.120 --> 32:03.120
Hi, this is dr. Nobel Prize

32:04.960 --> 32:08.840
I like your thesis on lesbians. Yeah, lesbians and in the world

32:09.840 --> 32:16.440
This is what this is why it's so sexy when girls make out is because you're looking at something dark and apocalyptic something

32:16.440 --> 32:20.200
That you can't possibly fathom the gravity of you're touching the darkness

32:20.200 --> 32:23.200
You've reached across the veil to see your end

32:23.200 --> 32:24.200
Through the void!

32:24.200 --> 32:29.200
Through the void! These girls are making out and you can see the inside

32:29.200 --> 32:35.200
You're bathed in a lost arc like glow as your face melts off

32:35.200 --> 32:37.200
Do you guys think it's gonna happen in our lifetime?

32:37.200 --> 32:39.200
God, we can only hope

32:39.200 --> 32:42.200
I hope so, that's the sexiest thing I've ever heard

32:42.200 --> 32:44.200
I want that to be the last thing I see

32:44.200 --> 32:46.200
I know, right? This is a chorus of girls making out

32:46.200 --> 32:51.200
My wife and I...

32:51.200 --> 32:57.200
Hey, do you remember before the show? When you were like, we have a lot of women listeners and we need to not

32:57.200 --> 32:58.200
This is why!

32:58.200 --> 33:00.200
This is why! Cause they love this

33:00.200 --> 33:02.200
They're like, that was so sexy

33:02.200 --> 33:05.200
Right now they're thinking about that, right now they're like, wow, what a sexy apocalypse

33:05.200 --> 33:08.200
What if we just started the apocalypse?

33:08.200 --> 33:11.200
We just planted the seed in everyone's head

33:11.200 --> 33:13.200
Planted the seed of the apocalypse

33:13.200 --> 33:16.200
Planted the seed in everyone's head

33:16.200 --> 33:17.200
Planted the seed of the apocalypse

33:17.200 --> 33:19.200
Everybody knows Ellen did that

33:19.200 --> 33:24.200
My wife and I have an ongoing argument about the proper way to say you're making a room cooler

33:24.200 --> 33:27.200
For example, she'll say I'm going to turn...

33:27.200 --> 33:30.200
Okay, I say I'm going to turn the AC up

33:30.200 --> 33:34.200
Whereas she believes you should say I'm turning the air down

33:34.200 --> 33:36.200
Come on, what's wrong with her?

33:36.200 --> 33:42.200
She's gotta know that I'm right and she's just BSing because she doesn't want to admit it, right?

33:42.200 --> 33:43.200
What do you guys say? I'm trying to think

33:43.200 --> 33:44.200
Divorce

33:44.200 --> 33:45.200
Yeah

33:45.200 --> 33:46.200
It's the only answer

33:46.200 --> 33:47.200
No, no

33:47.200 --> 33:50.200
I think I say I turn it, if it's too cold

33:50.200 --> 33:52.200
I always say up

33:52.200 --> 33:56.200
If I'm making it colder in the room, I'm going to turn it up

33:56.200 --> 33:57.200
I'm going to turn the AC up

33:57.200 --> 33:58.200
Right

33:58.200 --> 33:59.200
Yeah

33:59.200 --> 34:00.200
Yeah, that makes sense

34:00.200 --> 34:01.200
Yeah, that makes sense

34:01.200 --> 34:04.200
Or I'll say I'll turn the thermostat up

34:04.200 --> 34:07.200
And that means it's getting hotter

34:07.200 --> 34:09.200
This is a really complex question

34:09.200 --> 34:11.200
There needs to be some sort of standard

34:11.200 --> 34:12.200
Let's create

34:12.200 --> 34:15.200
I always just yell, I'm going to turn up the heat

34:15.200 --> 34:17.200
And then I slam dunk

34:17.200 --> 34:22.200
Just be like, if you say it's too hot in this bitch, I'm going to fix it

34:22.200 --> 34:25.200
Then people know what you're talking about, like they know what you're going to do

34:25.200 --> 34:28.200
And then now this bitch is too cold

34:28.200 --> 34:30.200
This bitch is cold

34:30.200 --> 34:34.200
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold, you might say

34:34.200 --> 34:37.200
Fix how chilly this bitch is

34:37.200 --> 34:40.200
I can't stop thinking about the end of the world

34:40.200 --> 34:44.200
Let's just take it to I'm going to adjust this

34:44.200 --> 34:46.200
Take out all the prepositions

34:46.200 --> 34:48.200
Oh, so it's sort of universal

34:48.200 --> 34:50.200
It could go either way at that point

34:50.200 --> 34:53.200
I'm going to alter the temperature in here, buckle up

34:53.200 --> 34:54.200
I don't know what's going to happen

34:54.200 --> 34:56.200
I'm going to affect this

34:56.200 --> 35:01.200
So I want to get

35:01.200 --> 35:03.200
Jesus Christ

35:03.200 --> 35:05.200
Do they just get weirder?

35:05.200 --> 35:08.200
Are we just turning into insane people as we record this show?

35:08.200 --> 35:10.200
We're doing the show earlier and earlier

35:10.200 --> 35:12.200
And I think that probably has an effect on it

35:12.200 --> 35:15.200
We need to stop doing it at 2.30 in the morning

35:15.200 --> 35:20.200
So I want to hear Griffin's last question that he's prepared for us

35:20.200 --> 35:23.200
But first I want to tell you how you can seek our guidance

35:23.200 --> 35:26.200
And maybe be told that you are A, a lesbian

35:26.200 --> 35:29.200
Or B, a pedophile

35:29.200 --> 35:32.200
These are the services we offer here

35:32.200 --> 35:36.200
Just mail hardtruths at mmbam.com

35:36.200 --> 35:38.200
A, a Lebophile

35:38.200 --> 35:40.200
A Lebophile

35:40.200 --> 35:42.200
Or Lebanese

35:42.200 --> 35:44.200
Or Lebanese if you didn't know that

35:44.200 --> 35:46.200
So you can email us

Guide people to us

36:09.200 --> 36:11.200

36:11.200 --> 36:13.200
I have a great statistic

36:13.200 --> 36:15.200
Tell me

36:15.200 --> 36:17.200

36:17.200 --> 36:19.200

36:19.200 --> 36:21.200
So many questions

36:21.200 --> 36:23.200
And we've answered all of them

36:23.200 --> 36:25.200
Which is the great part

36:25.200 --> 36:27.200
300 questions

36:27.200 --> 36:29.200
Thank you guys so much for listening

36:29.200 --> 36:33.200
We're getting closer to 100k downloads

36:33.200 --> 36:35.200
Oh man

36:35.200 --> 36:37.200
Which is going to be a big big event in my life

36:37.200 --> 36:39.200
I see on Twitter that

36:39.200 --> 36:41.200
Mrs. Kat Mulvaney

36:41.200 --> 36:43.200
Got her brother hooked on Mmbam

36:43.200 --> 36:45.200
She's doing the Lord's work

36:45.200 --> 36:47.200
If you want to get somebody hooked

36:47.200 --> 36:49.200

36:49.200 --> 36:51.200

37:05.200 --> 37:07.200
We're slipping a little bit off of the iTunes page

37:07.200 --> 37:09.200
So if you know anybody who works at iTunes

37:09.200 --> 37:11.200
So you can be like

37:11.200 --> 37:13.200
Let's start listening to this totally dope show

37:13.200 --> 37:15.200
Then you know

37:19.200 --> 37:21.200
We'll grant you that title

37:21.200 --> 37:23.200
So

37:23.200 --> 37:25.200
God bless you

37:25.200 --> 37:27.200
I guess is what I'm trying to say

37:27.200 --> 37:29.200
God bless you

37:29.200 --> 37:31.200
Can we end the show with that

37:31.200 --> 37:33.200
From now on instead

37:33.200 --> 37:35.200
God bless

37:35.200 --> 37:37.200
It depends, how good is the question

37:39.200 --> 37:41.200
Lily asks

37:41.200 --> 37:43.200
Women's health
