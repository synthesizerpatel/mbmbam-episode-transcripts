00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:48.560
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

00:48.560 --> 00:52.240
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:52.240 --> 00:58.880
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. I'm very defensive usually of living in West

00:58.880 --> 01:05.360
Virginia. Why don't you get out of there, people say, um, but I appreciate the pastoral living.

01:05.920 --> 01:08.400
Is that what you'd call it? I don't think-

01:08.400 --> 01:11.600
Because of Justin's- Justin's rural lifestyle.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.560
Right, you don't live on or near awe pasture.

01:15.280 --> 01:21.680
Yeah, it's more pastoral though in nature. That really bit me in the hinder this week though,

01:21.680 --> 01:25.680
because my power went out for four days.

01:25.680 --> 01:29.120
For four solid days.

01:29.120 --> 01:35.840
So are we speaking to a ghost now? Because I would literally die. I would literally die.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.760
I would probably gaslight myself because I would just sit there and go like,

01:41.760 --> 01:46.800
oh man, power's out, I can't watch TV. That's fine, I'll just play video games. Oh no.

01:47.520 --> 01:53.920
I used to think that this was a- this was like a- a regular occurrence,

01:53.920 --> 01:57.520
and then I told my boss, Chris, who lives in Philadelphia about this,

01:57.520 --> 02:02.800
and he said, my power went out once for 30 seconds during Hurricane Sandy.

02:03.520 --> 02:08.720
Like, well, okay, I guess that maybe it's not as common a problem.

02:08.720 --> 02:12.240
As opposed to 110 where the mayor sneezes and the power goes out.

02:12.240 --> 02:17.200
Right. Here's the depths of my depravity. This was my lowest moment is I-

02:17.200 --> 02:24.480
I go to the house on Friday night, I guess it was, and the power is still out,

02:24.480 --> 02:29.920
and it is fucking freezing. And I walk into the house, the power is out,

02:29.920 --> 02:34.080
the house is freezing, and there- and the cats are in the house.

02:34.080 --> 02:39.280
And it's so, so cold in there. And I can't get the cats because they're too fast,

02:39.280 --> 02:41.200
and it's pitch black. So I can't-

02:41.200 --> 02:43.280
Well, hold on, CJ's not too fast.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.920
CJ I could've grabbed, but what am I supposed to do? Take one of them,

02:45.920 --> 02:48.400
the one I like, and let the other one die, it seems to me.

02:48.960 --> 02:54.560
So I'm like, fucking, I gotta do something to help these cats.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.120
I don't know what I can do.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.920
It's like that scene in Pee Wee's Big Adventure, but in reverse.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.560
In reverse, right. So I wander around the house,

03:02.560 --> 03:04.320
and I'm like, wait a minute, I got a heater.

03:04.960 --> 03:10.880
And I'm like, downstairs, rummaging through the basement, falling over myself,

03:10.880 --> 03:17.600
and finally, I get the heater. I find it, and I struggle to carry it upstairs.

03:18.160 --> 03:24.720
And I go, and I shit you not, I put it in the upstairs hallway, and I plug it in.

03:24.720 --> 03:30.480
And then I just fucking stand there and stare at it for like 30 seconds.

03:30.480 --> 03:34.320
Like, what have I done? This is literally what happens to me.

03:34.320 --> 03:39.200
So I do that, I'm like, well, cats are dead, tough titties, I gotta move on with my life.

03:39.200 --> 03:44.400
So I go out of the house to, actually, I was gonna go back and retrieve Sidney

03:46.080 --> 03:47.280
to help us get the cats.

03:47.920 --> 03:53.120
So I go out of the car, and I see our next door neighbor

03:53.120 --> 03:57.280
lugging a $700 generator into the house.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.800
And as he literally crosses the threshold of his house,

04:01.680 --> 04:05.600
the power comes back on with his generator.

04:05.600 --> 04:09.840
I'm like, wow, you did that, because that is something worse

04:09.840 --> 04:11.840
happened to somebody else than what just happened to me.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.360
You had this terrible scenario.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.240
So he says, I can't believe it, you're welcome.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.480
I made that happen by buying this generator.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.800
I'm like, oh, thank God my cats are gonna be okay.

04:22.800 --> 04:28.000
And he said, do you wanna join us for a celebratory post-outage beer?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.760
I said, no, thank you, I can't.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.360
I have food and a baby and a wife waiting for me back at my in-laws place.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.120
I have to go tell them the good news.

04:35.120 --> 04:39.840
And I see him literally, I'm just pulling away, right?

04:40.400 --> 04:44.960
I see him literally clink beer cans with his buddy

04:44.960 --> 04:46.800
who is helping him lug the generator.

04:46.800 --> 04:50.880
I see them literally clink beer cans and the power shuts off.

04:50.880 --> 04:56.560
I thought you were gonna say clink beer cans with his new buddy,

04:56.560 --> 04:58.800
the generator that he purchased.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.760
His new $700 electro friend.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.640
Oh, buddy.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.360
Chappie 2.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.560
Now I'm a generator.

05:09.280 --> 05:12.640
We were talking on the phone while you were preparing soup

05:13.440 --> 05:18.800
in a pot that you had positioned over a fireplace.

05:18.800 --> 05:23.360
Like some sort of caveman with gas.

05:23.360 --> 05:23.680
You know what?

05:23.680 --> 05:27.040
It was the best bad soup I had ever had.

05:27.040 --> 05:35.600
You were making fucking goofy movie Hi Dad soup on your cigarette lighter.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.120
Yeah, it was not pleasant.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.360
It was not pleasant.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.520
I could, that was the lowest of low.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.440
Plugging in an electric heater.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.480
Am I here, cats?

05:45.040 --> 05:47.760
Boy, that was a jarring moment for the cats too.

05:47.760 --> 05:52.480
Like this is the entity that is charged with keeping us from dying.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.680
This is our lot in life.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.720
You think the cats are sitting there from the door going,

05:56.720 --> 05:58.080
no, don't plug it in.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.280
Oh, what are you doing?

05:59.280 --> 06:00.800
Idiots out.

06:00.800 --> 06:01.300
Idiot.

06:01.920 --> 06:02.400
Come on.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.480
You know what I would have done to keep those kitties warm?

06:05.200 --> 06:05.440
What?

06:05.440 --> 06:06.480
Just snuggled them.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.080
Snuggle them.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.000
Well, one of Justin's cats is snuggle averse.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.080
I've never touched one of Justin's cats.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.040
I don't think anybody has.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.440
This has been kitty talk.

06:18.080 --> 06:22.160
This has been kitty talk where you talk about our little bitty kitties.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.560
Welcome to the little bitty kitty committee.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.720
I'm Justin McElroy.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.560
I'm Justin Meowcleroy and I love my kitty.

06:30.560 --> 06:35.920
I'm Griffin McElroy, like a grr, like a growl,

06:35.920 --> 06:37.600
because my kitty's like a lion.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.400
I'm Travis McElroy.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.520
My workplace has become prank central.

06:47.760 --> 06:50.480
All the kitties getting in the mischief.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.320
Kitties getting in the milk and mischief.

06:52.320 --> 06:56.560
Where'd all my sardines go?

06:56.560 --> 06:58.400
And also all of my accounts.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.840
Oh god, they cleaned me out.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.200
The cat liquidated me.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.600
My workplace has become prank central.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.480
And I just had my coffee spiked with a cup of salt.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.520
What the fuck?

07:11.520 --> 07:14.080
One sip and I thought I was gonna vom on the spot.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.960
Yeah, because that's like what people do to make themselves vom.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.880
My knee-jerk reaction is to go thermonuclear,

07:20.880 --> 07:22.560
but I'd like to keep my job.

07:22.560 --> 07:25.200
What is an appropriate and measured response?

07:25.200 --> 07:26.320
That's from Gmail.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.480
This is so hard because how do you target the responsible party?

07:31.600 --> 07:32.640
Yeah, that's a good point.

07:32.640 --> 07:35.680
I mean, somebody probably claimed responsibility

07:35.680 --> 07:38.320
for this ipicac goof that they did on you.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.840
There's one of two scenarios here.

07:42.560 --> 07:47.600
Scenario one is this is like you work in a good times place,

07:47.600 --> 07:50.320
right, where everybody's everybody's best friend.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.000
Like a good times place.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.120
Like a good times place.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.720
Travis is suggesting like a fucking startup

07:56.720 --> 07:58.960
with 400 trillion dollars to spare

07:58.960 --> 08:00.320
and so everybody just plays ping pong.

08:00.320 --> 08:03.120
Otherwise you'd be too busy doing goddamn work

08:03.120 --> 08:05.600
to start playing salt in other people's coffee.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.920
So everybody just like pals around all the time

08:07.920 --> 08:09.680
and this is the kind of place where it's like,

08:09.680 --> 08:11.840
you know what, I just feel like not doing any work

08:11.840 --> 08:13.360
and just ordering pizzas today, right?

08:13.360 --> 08:15.840
So maybe it's that kind of place and you don't fit in.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.760
Where people can just hang out and do whatever.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.560
Right, and be shut down in like nine months.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.200
Work is played, foodie breaks the day.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.160
Yeah, and that's your,

08:24.160 --> 08:26.240
and you're the one who doesn't fit in, right?

08:26.240 --> 08:28.800
Because everybody else is like a good time buddy

08:28.800 --> 08:30.720
and you're like, oh guys, can we focus up?

08:30.720 --> 08:34.720
Or scenario two, this is a place of work.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.640
This is a business where work gets done

08:37.280 --> 08:42.480
and like some fucking, you know, like Tom Green over here,

08:42.480 --> 08:45.120
some kind of prankster, goofster

08:45.120 --> 08:47.440
is ruining it for everybody.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.880
And then I think you go to the boss and you narc.

08:50.880 --> 08:51.920
You just complain so hard.

08:51.920 --> 08:52.800
Oh yeah, yeah.

08:52.800 --> 08:57.600
You can't, I always hated Jim Halpert on The Office

08:57.600 --> 09:00.080
because it's like fucking do anything.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.240
You're being compensated.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.640
You know what the number one like piece

09:04.640 --> 09:06.160
of workplace theft is?

09:06.160 --> 09:07.200
It's time.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.880
And when you're fucking goofing constantly

09:10.880 --> 09:13.920
and not hitting the books or those streets

09:13.920 --> 09:15.600
or the papers or whatever it is you hit

09:16.800 --> 09:18.160
in whatever job he had,

09:18.160 --> 09:19.440
it's been a while since I've seen the show,

09:19.440 --> 09:22.080
but just like do some work, dude.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.000
How do you like sleep at night?

09:24.000 --> 09:27.920
I mean, he thinks he's so funny with his goofs and such,

09:27.920 --> 09:29.840
but maybe if he committed to his job,

09:29.840 --> 09:31.200
he would enjoy it more.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.200
He would get more satisfaction out of it

09:33.200 --> 09:36.320
if he would just do his work and leave that poor Dwight alone.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.840
Dwight's trying to do his work.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.920
He's got some social, you know, issues.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.240
Maybe he doesn't like get along well with everybody

09:42.240 --> 09:43.760
and he's not your normal fellow.

09:43.760 --> 09:47.040
So he should be tormented for that, Jim?

09:47.040 --> 09:50.320
Because he takes a pleasure in his craft,

09:50.320 --> 09:51.920
you fucking dick, Ed.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.080
Because he likes things like Battlestar Galactica

09:54.080 --> 09:55.040
and farming.

09:55.040 --> 09:58.320
So it's your job, Jim Halpert, to just terrorize him.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.760
Congratulations, Jim Halpert.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.760
You're Twitter, you piece of shit.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.000
You're a terrible person, Jim Halpert.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.680
You and Pam deserve each other.

10:06.320 --> 10:11.600
In this economy, we have just fallen into a deep pit.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.400
Help me out, Griffin.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.520
I just don't put salt in people's coffee for starters

10:15.520 --> 10:17.280
because some people need that shit.

10:18.480 --> 10:19.360
Salt or coffee?

10:19.360 --> 10:20.080
Coffee.

10:20.080 --> 10:20.560
Some people-

10:22.880 --> 10:24.560
What if you're on like a low-sodium diet?

10:25.120 --> 10:26.400
Because your doctor put you on that.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.480
Drink it and immediately have a heart attack.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.960
Yeah, cool attempted murder, you piece of shit.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.720
This is why I can't work in an office anymore

10:32.720 --> 10:34.960
because people are constantly trying to fucking kill you

10:34.960 --> 10:36.640
just to get a laugh off.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.280
I think the best response is to wait till that person

10:39.280 --> 10:41.680
is drinking their coffee and then walk up,

10:41.680 --> 10:43.120
take the coffee out of their hands,

10:43.120 --> 10:44.480
and smash it against the wall.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.080
And how's that prank?

10:46.080 --> 10:47.680
This is what you did to me.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.880
I'm literally doing it.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.240
And then just say like, prank.

10:50.800 --> 10:51.760
I pranked you.

10:51.760 --> 10:52.800
You've been pranked.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.560
I would say that if your natural response

10:54.560 --> 10:57.120
is to go like way over the top thermonuclear,

10:57.120 --> 10:58.000
you shouldn't-

10:58.000 --> 10:58.800
Try that word again.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.640
Thermonuclear.

11:00.640 --> 11:02.480
You shouldn't respond at all

11:03.520 --> 11:05.520
because I don't think you have a good gauge.

11:05.520 --> 11:10.640
And you know the fastest way to not get pranked again

11:10.640 --> 11:13.760
in the future is to have zero reaction

11:13.760 --> 11:14.960
to the thing that happened.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.080
You take a sip of the coffee,

11:16.080 --> 11:17.280
you almost Vince bomb,

11:17.280 --> 11:18.560
and then you just go like, no.

11:18.560 --> 11:19.680
And then you just pour it out.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.680
I liked it.

11:21.680 --> 11:22.560
I approve.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.160
And then you just like walk over,

11:24.160 --> 11:25.520
you quietly dump it out,

11:25.520 --> 11:26.640
you refill your coffee.

11:26.640 --> 11:27.520
Oh, okay.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.040
Listen, I have an actual good,

11:29.040 --> 11:30.720
I have an actual good response to this.

11:30.720 --> 11:31.920
Get in league with your boss

11:32.960 --> 11:37.360
and don't go into work on an upcoming day,

11:37.360 --> 11:38.320
maybe just tomorrow,

11:38.320 --> 11:40.000
whenever you listen to this tomorrow.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.040
And then when the person who salted your coffee asks,

11:43.040 --> 11:47.200
say that, well, Richard quit

11:47.200 --> 11:50.080
because people are so mean with their pranks.

11:50.080 --> 11:50.960
Or even better,

11:50.960 --> 11:53.120
he had to stay home sick with salt poisoning.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.880
He had salt poisoning.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.120
Hey, House of Cards season four sucks.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.160
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

12:02.160 --> 12:02.400
Yeah.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.000
This Yahoo was sent in by game,

12:06.000 --> 12:07.760
recognize the game, Rachel Sperling.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.080
Thank you.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.520
That guy who asks,

12:12.800 --> 12:14.560
how do I give up rapping?

12:16.720 --> 12:17.360
At one point,

12:17.360 --> 12:18.640
it just consumed my life

12:18.640 --> 12:20.240
and I'm tired of sinning.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.960
I look back and my old recordings sound very evil.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.240
Wait, hold on one more time.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.400
First sentence again.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.120
At one point,

12:27.120 --> 12:28.320
it just consumed my life

12:28.320 --> 12:29.520
and I'm tired of sinning.

12:30.080 --> 12:30.880
Okay.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.480
I look back and my old recordings

12:32.480 --> 12:34.320
sound very evil and scary.

12:34.320 --> 12:34.820
Boo.

12:35.760 --> 12:36.560
Every time I quit,

12:36.560 --> 12:37.680
I get drawn back in.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.920
How do I stop this addiction?

12:39.920 --> 12:41.520
Man, how do you figure it out?

12:41.520 --> 12:42.800
Sincerely, Dr. Dre.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.320
I just want to do my headphone thing.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.840
I wish I could quit this speaking.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.040
People keep wanting detox.

12:51.040 --> 12:51.520
They say,

12:51.520 --> 12:53.040
please drop detox, Dre.

12:53.040 --> 12:53.600
And I say,

12:53.600 --> 12:54.080
I can't,

12:54.080 --> 12:55.200
it's evil and sinning

12:55.200 --> 12:56.800
and I can't go back to those rapping ways.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.600
I just listen back to it

12:59.600 --> 13:00.240
and I'm like,

13:00.240 --> 13:01.200
what was I thinking?

13:02.560 --> 13:03.120
Can you quit

13:03.120 --> 13:07.920
or can you do like a fucking Will Smith brand shift

13:07.920 --> 13:08.640
where it's just like,

13:09.200 --> 13:10.160
I only rap about things

13:10.160 --> 13:11.200
that make people feel good

13:11.200 --> 13:12.160
and no swears,

13:12.160 --> 13:12.960
no sin.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.200
I don't think God listens to Will Smith.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.520
I mean, of course God listens to Will Smith.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.360
I don't think just like in prayer

13:19.360 --> 13:20.560
and also he has all of his albums

13:20.560 --> 13:21.440
because they're really good

13:21.440 --> 13:22.960
and we're all waiting for that new shit.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.560
That new stuff.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.080
Sorry, I'm going to try and answer this question

13:26.080 --> 13:27.440
in the style of Will Smith.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.560
I'm going to just try and live my life

13:28.560 --> 13:29.040
a little bit closer.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.000
You're going to have to reference

13:30.000 --> 13:31.280
Miami a lot more.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.080
I'm going to have to just try

13:32.080 --> 13:33.040
and live my life a little bit

13:33.040 --> 13:34.160
closer to Will.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.560
And so go do the Will Smith thing.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.600
God listens to Will Smith

13:37.600 --> 13:38.240
and it's like,

13:38.240 --> 13:39.760
I like this guy's style.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.200
I like how he keeps it clean.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.400
His big Willy style.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.240
It's funny because it's clean,

13:44.240 --> 13:46.080
but it's still so edgy.

13:46.880 --> 13:47.760
Because he has that song

13:47.760 --> 13:48.800
that's all about candy

13:48.800 --> 13:49.120
and he's like,

13:49.120 --> 13:49.760
you sweet,

13:49.760 --> 13:50.880
good enough to eat.

13:50.880 --> 13:53.040
Make a fellow want to TLC creep.

13:53.040 --> 13:53.520
And it's like,

13:53.520 --> 13:55.120
I love that reference.

13:55.120 --> 13:55.920
I love candy.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.400
And I love how you didn't just swear Will Smith.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.600
So can we do like,

13:59.600 --> 14:01.280
can you come a little bit closer?

14:01.280 --> 14:01.840
Come with me.

14:01.840 --> 14:02.480
Take my hand.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.160
We're going to walk a little closer

14:04.160 --> 14:05.360
with you, Will Smith.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.640
There's three pairs of footprints

14:06.640 --> 14:07.200
in the sand.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.240
One's me, one's you,

14:08.240 --> 14:09.360
one's Big Will.

14:09.360 --> 14:10.480
And then every so often

14:10.480 --> 14:11.920
there's like a missed spot

14:11.920 --> 14:12.320
in the middle

14:12.320 --> 14:13.280
and that's where Big Will

14:13.280 --> 14:14.320
and God were swinging me.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.480
And then there's some erratic

14:16.480 --> 14:18.160
two pairs of footsteps

14:18.160 --> 14:19.760
and then one of them disappears.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.560
And then like,

14:20.560 --> 14:22.080
and then 15 feet down the line,

14:22.080 --> 14:24.960
there's just like a big like impact mark.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.320
It's like the shape of a human

14:26.320 --> 14:27.840
and that's where Uncle Phil

14:27.840 --> 14:29.680
picked up DJ Jazzy Jeff

14:29.680 --> 14:30.400
and launched him

14:30.400 --> 14:31.600
like a human torpedo.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.520
DJ Jesus Jeff.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.720
So you could definitely do that.

14:36.720 --> 14:37.680
I think Griffin,

14:37.680 --> 14:38.720
the point you're missing

14:39.440 --> 14:43.040
is not how to revamp his rap,

14:43.040 --> 14:45.680
but how does one stop the thing

14:45.680 --> 14:47.280
that is so inherent,

14:47.280 --> 14:49.520
so intrinsic in your DNA

14:50.240 --> 14:51.920
that like you can't imagine

14:51.920 --> 14:53.360
not doing it anymore?

14:53.360 --> 14:54.240
You know what I mean?

14:54.240 --> 14:56.080
Like we all have that thing

14:56.080 --> 14:57.920
where it's like when I wake up,

14:57.920 --> 15:00.160
I'm eating and breathing cross stitch, right?

15:00.160 --> 15:02.640
Like how do I not cross stitch anymore?

15:02.640 --> 15:04.160
It is at this point

15:04.160 --> 15:06.240
so identifiably me

15:06.240 --> 15:07.840
that when people think Travis,

15:07.840 --> 15:09.120
they think cross stitch.

15:09.120 --> 15:09.360
Sure.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.640
And to answer this actual question,

15:12.640 --> 15:14.320
if I could just like actually answer

15:14.320 --> 15:15.760
a question for once,

15:15.760 --> 15:18.320
the secret is to not rhyme

15:18.320 --> 15:19.200
when you're talking.

15:19.200 --> 15:19.920
That's the trick.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.360
You're gonna do that once.

15:21.360 --> 15:21.760
You're gonna be like-

15:21.760 --> 15:23.680
So like if you catch yourself,

15:23.680 --> 15:25.600
like let me welcome everybody

15:25.600 --> 15:27.040
to the wild wild west,

15:27.040 --> 15:28.320
a state that's untouchable,

15:28.320 --> 15:31.440
like Elliott Spitzer.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.840
If you see yourself about to rhyme,

15:35.840 --> 15:39.760
you just like turn the whole ship around.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.200
Justin, you are so right

15:41.200 --> 15:42.640
because I was about to suggest

15:42.640 --> 15:44.000
just don't record it,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.080
but then I've seen people rhyming

15:46.080 --> 15:46.960
but not record

15:46.960 --> 15:49.440
just walking down the street and rhyming.

15:49.440 --> 15:50.480
Is this a thing people,

15:50.480 --> 15:52.000
this is an epidemic?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.440
Is it, it's gonna be like,

15:55.760 --> 15:56.400
what happens,

15:56.400 --> 15:57.120
you know what happens

15:57.120 --> 15:58.480
to a dream deferred?

15:58.480 --> 15:59.280
It gets all,

15:59.280 --> 16:01.360
it gets all raisiny and fucked up.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.720
And that's the problem is,

16:02.720 --> 16:03.680
I feel like if you try

16:03.680 --> 16:04.720
and keep this inside,

16:04.720 --> 16:05.120
you can't,

16:05.760 --> 16:08.080
you can't purge this urge

16:09.440 --> 16:10.800
like a glass of surge.

16:11.360 --> 16:11.760
Do you know what I mean?

16:11.760 --> 16:13.600
Oh no, they got him.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.960
Oh no, here I go.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.560
I've promised I would stop

16:17.120 --> 16:18.320
because I was a flop,

16:18.320 --> 16:19.600
but I'd chip it,

16:19.600 --> 16:21.840
chip it, chip, chip, chip, chip, chop.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.800
You're having a stroke.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.000
It was a joke.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.280
No, it was a joke

16:27.280 --> 16:29.040
and I'm telling on the show

16:29.040 --> 16:30.800
and Elliot Spitzer.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.840
Here's a rap tip from us to you.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.960
If you ever get tired

16:38.960 --> 16:39.920
in the middle of a rap

16:39.920 --> 16:40.880
or sleepy

16:40.880 --> 16:42.880
or just can't think of words to say,

16:42.880 --> 16:44.160
say chip a chip chip.

16:45.360 --> 16:47.360
Or and or Elliot Spitzer,

16:47.360 --> 16:48.640
which is a magical word

16:48.640 --> 16:49.680
that rhymes with anything.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.040
Some would call it two words.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.480
Scientists have yet to agree

16:54.480 --> 16:56.640
on how many words Elliot Spitzer is.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.600
You can't give up rapping.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.320
Just I would say

17:00.320 --> 17:02.160
just try and walk a little closer with me.

17:02.160 --> 17:02.800
Will Smith.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.320
I've been Will Smith this whole time.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.160
Thank you all for listening to the podcast.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.120
Is it rude to show up

17:07.120 --> 17:08.800
to a themed birthday party

17:09.440 --> 17:11.520
not dressed in the requested attire?

17:12.160 --> 17:13.840
My friend is turning 30

17:13.840 --> 17:15.920
and her husband is planning

17:15.920 --> 17:18.240
a surprise 90s themed dance party.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.960
I don't have any frumpy high-waisted jeans,

17:20.960 --> 17:22.160
overalls, crop tops,

17:22.160 --> 17:23.040
high top tennis shoes

17:23.040 --> 17:24.640
or anything else remotely 90s.

17:24.640 --> 17:25.680
And I don't feel like rummaging

17:25.680 --> 17:26.800
through all the local thrift stores

17:26.800 --> 17:27.920
for these types of items.

17:28.720 --> 17:29.680
Would I be as lame as the people

17:29.680 --> 17:31.280
who show up to Halloween party stands costume

17:31.280 --> 17:32.400
or is this different

17:32.400 --> 17:34.720
and not as big as a social faux pas?

17:34.720 --> 17:35.440
Please help.

17:35.440 --> 17:38.000
That's from lost my LA gears in Georgia.

17:39.040 --> 17:39.360
Yes.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.680
Yeah, I just don't like,

17:42.240 --> 17:42.880
you know what?

17:42.880 --> 17:44.880
Like I don't feel like it

17:44.880 --> 17:46.800
is not a is not a condition

17:47.360 --> 17:49.280
by which you get to not do like

17:49.280 --> 17:52.000
nobody feel nobody's woke up as like

17:52.000 --> 17:54.320
I've got to dig out my hyper color t-shirts

17:54.320 --> 17:55.360
from storage.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.360
We do it because it's funny for other people.

17:57.360 --> 17:58.960
Like nobody feels like doing it.

17:58.960 --> 17:59.440
Unless.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.240
Tough nuggies.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.840
Unless, unless.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.800
This friend is constantly trying

18:04.800 --> 18:06.320
to do themed parties.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.760
Yeah, and that is rude.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.600
That's the rude shit right there.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.360
If this is like, listen,

18:11.360 --> 18:14.720
he's turning 30 or she's turning 30

18:14.720 --> 18:17.360
and like we like our group of friends

18:17.360 --> 18:20.880
have like not done a theme party in years.

18:20.880 --> 18:21.360
Yeah.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.440
Then yeah, you have to go.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.520
You have to at least make an effort.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.800
But if it's like every other week

18:28.800 --> 18:29.840
they're trying to do like

18:29.840 --> 18:32.560
a Quentin Tarantino themed party

18:32.560 --> 18:33.920
and we're going to watch shit

18:33.920 --> 18:35.760
and now we're doing this

18:35.760 --> 18:36.880
and we'll do an Oscars party

18:36.880 --> 18:38.160
where everyone like then it's like,

18:38.160 --> 18:38.560
okay, you know what?

18:38.560 --> 18:41.280
You ran out of ideas so quickly, Travis.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.000
Holy shit.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.640
No famous magicians

18:44.640 --> 18:45.920
was the only other thing I had.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.320
But they all wear the same shit.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.320
They all look exactly the same

18:50.320 --> 18:51.600
except for David.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.080
Everybody wore a straight jacket.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.000
Did nobody like talk to each other

18:56.000 --> 18:58.400
before how are we supposed to pick up drinks?

18:58.960 --> 19:00.240
I think a good rule of thumb

19:00.240 --> 19:01.920
for anything like this is where you think,

19:02.640 --> 19:03.920
okay, in your mind,

19:03.920 --> 19:05.600
flash forward to the party

19:05.600 --> 19:07.120
where everybody's dressed up

19:07.120 --> 19:09.840
and you walk in in just your regular clothes

19:09.840 --> 19:11.520
and that's the rest of your night.

19:12.080 --> 19:12.640
You know what I mean?

19:12.640 --> 19:13.360
Where people were like,

19:13.360 --> 19:15.440
oh, you didn't.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.560
Oh, why didn't you?

19:16.560 --> 19:18.080
And your only explanation is

19:18.080 --> 19:20.480
I didn't feel like looking for the stuff

19:21.040 --> 19:23.360
where everybody else has done it.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.640
And like, there's your host,

19:24.640 --> 19:25.760
like looking at you like,

19:25.760 --> 19:27.680
oh, you chose not to participate.

19:28.560 --> 19:29.920
I think when you think about it

19:29.920 --> 19:30.880
in that context,

19:30.880 --> 19:32.960
in like the reality of the situation,

19:32.960 --> 19:36.480
it's pretty clear that you would feel rude

19:37.040 --> 19:38.880
because they asked you to do a thing

19:38.880 --> 19:39.760
and you might as well.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.800
It's like if somebody said,

19:40.800 --> 19:43.520
everybody bring a dish and you didn't.

19:43.520 --> 19:46.000
It's rude to have a theme party at all first.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.160
You should let somebody get that far

19:48.160 --> 19:49.360
out of their head,

19:49.360 --> 19:50.560
like get that much out.

19:50.560 --> 19:51.840
Hey, we're having a theme party.

19:51.840 --> 19:52.640
That's rude.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.560
That's very rude of you to do.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.120
You are right, Justin.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.240
Here's my suggestion.

19:58.880 --> 20:02.320
I used to mow the lawn at our house

20:02.320 --> 20:03.280
and then I just started doing

20:03.280 --> 20:04.240
such a shitty job of it

20:04.240 --> 20:06.240
that dad stopped asking me to mow the lawn

20:06.240 --> 20:08.160
and I gracefully bowed out.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.840
I think if you can show up

20:12.000 --> 20:13.040
to each of these parties

20:13.040 --> 20:16.160
that technically fits the bill

20:16.160 --> 20:19.280
but is so wildly inaccurate

20:19.280 --> 20:20.720
and bad and wrong

20:22.400 --> 20:24.880
that they will just stop doing them entirely.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.600
I thought you meant 1890s.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.360
Or you show up dressed up

20:29.360 --> 20:30.880
as Sonic the Hedgehog

20:30.880 --> 20:31.360
and they're like,

20:31.920 --> 20:32.800
what the fuck?

20:32.800 --> 20:33.360
And you're like-

20:33.360 --> 20:34.320
That would be fresh.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.760
That would be dope, Griff,

20:35.760 --> 20:36.640
are you kidding me?

20:36.640 --> 20:37.760
Right, but then they throw like,

20:38.720 --> 20:40.400
come dressed up as your favorite food

20:40.400 --> 20:43.120
and you show up like Sonic the Hedgehog

20:43.120 --> 20:43.840
and you're like,

20:43.840 --> 20:44.320
I don't know,

20:44.320 --> 20:46.080
you could probably cook and eat a hedgehog.

20:46.080 --> 20:49.280
I don't know, famous presidents.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.200
Hi, I'm Sonic T. Hedgehog.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.840
That's me, our nation's 61st president.

20:53.840 --> 20:54.240
And you're like,

20:54.240 --> 20:55.840
what are you fucking talking about?

20:55.840 --> 20:56.400
And you're like,

20:56.400 --> 20:59.280
you can't prove that Sonic the Hedgehog

20:59.280 --> 21:01.280
won't be our nation's 61st president.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.040
Why don't you keep an open mind?

21:03.040 --> 21:05.600
And then they have a Oscars party.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.880
Everybody's black tie

21:06.880 --> 21:08.400
and I'm Sonic the Hedgehog.

21:08.400 --> 21:08.880
Hello.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.560
And pretty soon you stop being invited

21:10.560 --> 21:11.440
to parties at all

21:11.440 --> 21:12.720
and then you don't have to worry about it anymore.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.080
Well, no, that's the thing.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.240
Then they have a Sonic the Hedgehog party

21:16.240 --> 21:17.840
and you show up as Judge Lance Ito.

21:20.560 --> 21:21.840
Judge Lance Ito

21:21.840 --> 21:24.160
is part of the extended Sonicverse.

21:24.160 --> 21:27.200
He was in the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game

21:27.200 --> 21:29.280
playing Dr. Robotnik.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.520
What I'm saying is Sonic the Hedgehog

21:31.520 --> 21:33.360
is just a great character.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.160
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

21:34.720 --> 21:35.280
Yes.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.600
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Ian Dunn.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.240
Thank you, Ian.

21:38.240 --> 21:41.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Fairy Girl who asks,

21:43.360 --> 21:48.000
what is the meaning of every tattoo Adam Levine has?

21:50.320 --> 21:50.640
What is the-

21:50.640 --> 21:51.760
How much time do you got?

21:51.760 --> 21:54.800
What is the meaning of every tattoo Adam Levine has?

21:54.800 --> 21:55.920
I know some of them,

21:55.920 --> 21:58.960
like the Roman numeral 10 and the 222,

21:59.600 --> 22:00.880
but what about everything else?

22:02.800 --> 22:05.120
He's got the one that wards off evil.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.280
The rose piece is on his left shoulder, right?

22:07.280 --> 22:07.680
Right.

22:07.680 --> 22:12.000
He's got the mom on his left forearm.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.200
He's got the Ghostbusters logo over his left eyeball.

22:17.760 --> 22:20.400
He's got the Deathly Hallows around his nipple.

22:20.400 --> 22:20.800
Sure.

22:20.800 --> 22:24.160
He's got the fake beard tattooed on his face.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.960
Right under the Ghostbusters logo.

22:27.760 --> 22:32.160
On his other eye, he has the Ghostbusters logo,

22:32.160 --> 22:35.280
but the two one where the ghost is putting up the peace sign.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.960
Oh no, wait, that's two, isn't it?

22:36.960 --> 22:38.880
He's got the tattoo on his butt

22:38.880 --> 22:41.120
where it looks like Slimers coming out of his butt crack.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.640
His butt, yeah.

22:42.640 --> 22:45.120
He has a lot of Ghostbusters tattoos.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.960
I didn't put that together until just now.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.040
Yeah, well, it's good luck.

22:49.040 --> 22:54.800
This dude has such a broad assortment of tattoos.

22:54.800 --> 22:58.560
Yeah, I think he adhered to the Travis McElroy school

22:58.560 --> 23:05.520
of tattoo themes where it's just like a lot of different stuff.

23:05.520 --> 23:06.480
Mm-hmm.

23:06.480 --> 23:09.840
For instance, there's a paw print that says,

23:09.840 --> 23:13.040
Frankie Girl, as it refers to Golden Retriever Frankie.

23:13.920 --> 23:15.920
There's a script tattoo.

23:15.920 --> 23:19.360
I'm reading an answer because somebody fucking busted out a bullet point here.

23:19.360 --> 23:22.480
There's a tattoo written in either Hindi or Sanskrit

23:22.480 --> 23:26.640
on the left side of his chest that has been hard to get a photo of,

23:26.640 --> 23:29.280
but it is believed to say Maroon 5.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.480
It's like there are goddamn dead sea scrolls.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.600
There are apocryphal Adam tattoos.

23:36.800 --> 23:40.720
And I would disagree just by Googling Adam Levine tattoos,

23:40.720 --> 23:43.200
but that has not been hard to get a picture of

23:43.200 --> 23:45.280
because there are bajillions of them.

23:46.480 --> 23:47.440
On the left side of Adam-

23:47.440 --> 23:49.120
Adam Levine's a fit dude.

23:49.120 --> 23:52.160
Yeah, dude, he's ripped and his body's crazy,

23:52.160 --> 23:55.040
but he's got a tattoo on his left bicep that is an X,

23:55.040 --> 23:57.920
meaning 10, for the 10-year anniversary of Maroon 5.

23:57.920 --> 24:00.080
I got that exact same tattoo.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.080
I'm surprised I didn't see him there.

24:02.080 --> 24:04.960
Well, they were giving them away free at the tattoo parlor.

24:04.960 --> 24:07.520
Just come in and let us celebrate Maroon 5.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.840
So this motherfucker is in a band called Maroon 5.

24:09.840 --> 24:12.000
He's got a tattoo that it has 222.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.040
That's for the number on the door,

24:13.040 --> 24:15.280
the very first studio that Maroon 5 ever recorded in.

24:15.280 --> 24:18.480
He's got an X for the number 10 for the 10-year anniversary of Maroon 5.

24:18.480 --> 24:21.840
Nowhere on his fucking body does he have a goddamn 5

24:22.640 --> 24:25.360
for the number in his goddamn number band.

24:26.320 --> 24:29.280
Hi, hi, my name is Matchbox 20.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.640
I'm from Matchbox 20.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.840
We've been going for 30 years, so I got a 30 tattooed on my body

24:33.840 --> 24:34.720
because I'm an idiot.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.200
Travis, why are you sending me a link to Pinterest?

24:39.840 --> 24:43.600
Oh, good, an Adams Inc. user guide from People magazine.

24:44.960 --> 24:48.960
Now this claims that the Sanskrit means austerity.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.600
Does this mean austerity of Maroon 5?

24:52.800 --> 24:54.560
That's the same thing.

24:54.560 --> 24:58.400
He's got a shark tattoo from facing his fear of them.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.680
Of sharks?

24:59.680 --> 25:01.840
Of shark, no, of shark tattoos.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.000
He's terrified of shark tattoos.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.200
Shark, you look at me straight in your dead black eyes

25:07.200 --> 25:09.680
like a doll's eyes because I'm gonna get a tattoo of you,

25:09.680 --> 25:13.280
but I promised myself I'd look at you for 30 seconds first.

25:13.280 --> 25:16.320
I made it 20 and you just gotta stay still.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.160
Well, he got that tattoo from a shark.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.920
Adam, I noticed you keep looking at the door.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.360
Is everything okay?

25:25.360 --> 25:26.320
No, it's fine, it's fine.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.080
Yeah, you know it's pretty good.

25:28.080 --> 25:31.280
It's just getting harder and harder to breathe.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.200
I've got a great idea for a song.

25:38.480 --> 25:41.200
I've gotta go start a band so I can write it.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.280
Okay, listen to this shit, listen to this.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.640
But then as he stumbles outside,

25:44.640 --> 25:48.240
he sees five Maroon cars drive by and he goes, Eureka!

25:49.360 --> 25:53.360
There is another new piece in the collection of Adam Levine tattoos

25:53.360 --> 25:59.360
on the right side of his chest that is not yet revealed.

25:59.360 --> 26:03.120
There's a teaser for him of 2016.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.680
There are photos that offer a little hint,

26:05.680 --> 26:10.000
but as of yet, there is no confirmation as to what is actually there.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.520
There is also a rumor of a new back piece that hasn't been revealed yet either.

26:13.520 --> 26:14.960
Do you know how about, but Jeff Griffin,

26:14.960 --> 26:16.880
do you know how fucked it is of it?

26:16.880 --> 26:19.040
Like, do you know what it says about Adam Levine?

26:19.040 --> 26:23.920
That the fact that people can't see like his skin, all of his skin all the time

26:23.920 --> 26:26.160
is the questionable thing?

26:26.160 --> 26:29.200
Like, we have those things here in the regular world.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.800
They're called clothes and we wear them to cover our tattoos.

26:32.800 --> 26:40.160
Dude, if I had a crazy, blown out, rip a dip body like Adam Levine,

26:40.160 --> 26:44.400
if my shit was top of the class, so, so tight,

26:44.400 --> 26:45.760
I have moves just like Jagger.

26:45.760 --> 26:50.480
Bumps, ridges, Jagger moves, Jagger bumps and ridges,

26:50.480 --> 26:53.680
Kighton, Kighton under the skin though,

26:53.680 --> 27:02.560
to just give it a 14 pack fucking blissful, sweet, sweet pasture of man, man flesh.

27:03.200 --> 27:06.000
I would never wear clothes anywhere ever again.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.160
Guys, can I ask you a real talk question?

27:08.160 --> 27:09.520
Just real talk for a second.

27:09.520 --> 27:10.080
What's wrong?

27:11.040 --> 27:13.760
Don't you think Adam Levine's probably super cool to hang out with?

27:13.760 --> 27:16.080
I bet he's probably a super cool dude.

27:16.080 --> 27:17.600
I bet he's so chill.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.280
I bet, but he's not going to happen

27:19.280 --> 27:21.440
because I just yelled at him on the internet about it.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.040
I haven't yelled at him.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.880
That's a high quality hang, man.

27:24.880 --> 27:29.360
All I want to do is spend the day with Adam Levine and Rob Thomas.

27:29.360 --> 27:33.280
Like that, if I could tell 16 year old Travis

27:33.280 --> 27:36.560
that 31 year old Travis can make that happen for him,

27:36.560 --> 27:38.400
like that would just be the best.

27:38.400 --> 27:42.400
Travis, can you get Adam Levine on the show as a guest spurt?

27:42.400 --> 27:44.960
All right, try and stop me, Justin.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.760
We couldn't get Scott back, but maybe we can get Adam Levine.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.560
Adam Levine, we'll get him in the studio with the three of us

27:50.560 --> 27:53.600
at one point in the middle of recording when he's doing an answer.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.040
Justin, you're going to sneak up behind him

27:55.040 --> 27:58.960
and we're going to make eye contact and I'll mouth one, two, three, go.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.320
You'll hit him with the chloroform

28:00.320 --> 28:02.640
and then I'm going to tattoo a five on this fucker's body.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.600
I'm going to fix Adam Levine

28:09.600 --> 28:17.280
because right now his shit is broken.

28:17.280 --> 28:29.280
Okay, now seriously, let's go.

28:29.280 --> 28:32.880
We got a really awesome new advertiser to tell you all about this week.

28:32.880 --> 28:38.160
It's Slip Shine, which proudly publishes over 150 pages of fun,

28:38.160 --> 28:41.760

You can get access to fresh content monthly and 10 years of archives.

28:59.360 --> 29:03.280
Now that's the stuff we legally have to say for this ad,

29:03.280 --> 29:06.000
but the thing is you guys really, really have to go.

29:06.000 --> 29:11.280
You have to go. SlipShine.net slash MBMBAM.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.320
SlipShine.net slash MBMBAM.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.840
This is not a test.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.840
There's a special page, you're going to love it.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.000
There's a comic for all of us.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.360
Now this is not safe for work.

29:25.360 --> 29:29.680
This is a grown folks website for grown folks.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.720
This is for grown folks only, but you're going to love it.

29:32.720 --> 29:38.160
If all the comics are so positive and it's so great and everything is so great,

29:38.160 --> 29:41.760
this landing page is so good.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.640
You're in for a treat.

29:44.640 --> 29:49.920
Listen, again, seriously though, this is horny stuff.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.360
This is horny stuff, y'all.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.040
This is really horny stuff.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.960
This is grade A horny material.

29:56.960 --> 30:01.360
If you got Net Nanny, she is going to throw down several flags over this website.

30:01.360 --> 30:05.280
This is NSFW, like teengoogle.com.

30:05.280 --> 30:07.040
Right, well, no, teengoogle isn't-

30:07.040 --> 30:10.000
No, we've been getting a lot of tweets and emails from people

30:10.000 --> 30:17.600
that apparently teengoogle.com gets blocked by a lot of Net Nanny-esque sites.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.400
People can't check teengoogle at work.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.880
Net Nanny has probably also listened to the show before

30:22.880 --> 30:25.520
and she probably knows the foul nature of our doings.

30:25.520 --> 30:29.280
SlipShine.net slash MBMBAM, go right now.

30:29.280 --> 30:36.800
Now, after you masturbate to that, you'll be hungry.

30:37.760 --> 30:40.880
The good news is we got a great solution for you there too.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.680
Wash your hands between.

30:43.680 --> 30:47.520
Wash your hands before you grab your naturebox.com.

30:47.520 --> 30:48.640
After you-

30:48.640 --> 30:49.760
Do it, do it.

30:49.760 --> 30:53.120
After you're done with your box, why not reach for naturebox.com?

30:53.840 --> 30:56.560
It's snacks on snacks on snacks on snacks.

30:56.560 --> 31:00.000
I also call my penis a box, so-

31:00.000 --> 31:02.720
Naturebox.com has something for everyone

31:02.720 --> 31:05.360
with zero artificial flavors, colors, or sweeteners,

31:05.360 --> 31:08.080
zero grams trans fat, and no high fructose corn syrup.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.680
This is wholesome stuff.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.880
I gotta tell you guys, I got a new nature box in the mail.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.440
I have a new hot recommendation for you.

31:15.440 --> 31:20.560
It is the almond biscotti bites, vanilla almond biscotti bites,

31:20.560 --> 31:22.240
or lemon almond biscotti bites, that's what it is.

31:22.240 --> 31:26.800
It's a delicious, delicious snack that I can highly recommend.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.800
And it came in a trial box.

31:28.800 --> 31:34.240
You get five free snacks, a box of free snacks,

31:34.800 --> 31:37.280
by going to naturebox.com slash my brother.

31:37.280 --> 31:38.720
This is really delicious stuff.

31:38.720 --> 31:40.080
You get a free trial box of snacks.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.040
There's no risk.

31:41.040 --> 31:41.600
Check it out.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.400
See if you like it.

31:42.400 --> 31:42.880
You will.

31:43.520 --> 31:44.720
And you get a subscription.

31:44.720 --> 31:47.280
And then every month you can get whatever snacks you choose.

31:48.160 --> 31:50.080
Maybe some big island pineapple.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.000
I'm gonna use some pistachio power cluster.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.240
Is it possible to have the website pick snacks for you

31:56.240 --> 31:58.160
so that when I open up that nature box,

31:59.200 --> 32:02.320
I can like fucking play the Zelda music behind it?

32:03.120 --> 32:05.440
Like, what am I gonna have in here?

32:05.440 --> 32:08.160
And also, I don't want any of the snacks to have labels on them.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.560
I just want to have content that I can start eating.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.640
And no bags, just a loose box.

32:12.640 --> 32:18.240
Just a loose box of basically mystery gorp.

32:18.240 --> 32:22.240
And if the mailman could really just beat the shit out of the box,

32:22.240 --> 32:25.040
that would be great.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.800
Maybe drag it on the ground.

32:26.800 --> 32:30.640
A lot of people ask me what the parmesan garlic pop pop sound like.

32:30.640 --> 32:31.120
So this is-

32:31.120 --> 32:31.680
Oh, great.

32:32.320 --> 32:32.640
Really?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.840
Oh, God.

32:35.840 --> 32:40.080
Oh, nothing makes good radio like listening to someone gum on something.

32:40.080 --> 32:41.520
Hey, have you listened to my bim bam?

32:41.520 --> 32:44.480
You could really hear the insides of Justin McElroy's cheeks.

32:44.480 --> 32:48.400
naturebox.com slash my brother.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.760
Um, I have a message.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.720
Very special message for Brian Lee.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.480
And it's from Amber, who says,

32:54.480 --> 32:55.200
Hi, Blee.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.480
I know we don't have an official anniversary date,

32:58.480 --> 33:00.160
so let's just say it's today.

33:00.160 --> 33:03.600
Thanks for seven years of being cute and great all the time.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.600
You are my shining golden treasure,

33:05.600 --> 33:08.560
and I hope I haven't spoiled this surprise by the time you hear it.

33:08.560 --> 33:10.240
I love you a whole bunch, Amb.

33:11.280 --> 33:14.080
Um, that's super great.

33:14.080 --> 33:18.160
I love that Amber probably wanted their anniversary date to be,

33:18.720 --> 33:20.720
let's say a month and a half to two months ago.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.320
No, we nailed this one.

33:22.320 --> 33:23.760
We nailed this one.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.760
Yes, we hit the window.

33:26.800 --> 33:31.680
She asked for between March 8th and 14th, and we did it.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.680
First time, five years.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.440
Yeah, stuck the landing.

33:36.320 --> 33:42.160
We have established a super precedent for the inaugural date of your love.

33:42.160 --> 33:45.200
And I'm happy that we could be a part of this.

33:45.200 --> 33:49.200
And it is the second Monday of every March.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.480
Well, I don't think it's not.

33:51.760 --> 33:52.960
It's not Hanukkah.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.080
It's not a federal holiday.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.360
Today's not going to wander around.

33:56.800 --> 34:02.000
Got a message for Brian Miskell from Julian, Sanford, Kate, Katie, and Lilla.

34:02.720 --> 34:10.320
Happy birthday, the most truthful Shelmerdian ever to grace the American stage.

34:10.320 --> 34:14.800
To a hunky boy and a NBNB AM aficionado, so dedicated he knows,

34:14.800 --> 34:18.160
we're throwing big words in here just to hear Justin pronounce them.

34:18.160 --> 34:25.120
Oh, Sesquipedian, do it again.

34:25.120 --> 34:25.680
Keep doing it.

34:25.680 --> 34:30.240
This is the rest of the show.

34:30.240 --> 34:36.080
To an onstage cruder more euphonious than a macarons singing this vampire horse likes blood.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.360
You're going to go far, man.

34:37.360 --> 34:38.080
Well, there you go.

34:38.080 --> 34:39.520
You fucking sicko.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.400
You got your job.

34:40.400 --> 34:41.520
Are you happy now?

34:41.520 --> 34:42.320
Are you happy now?

34:42.320 --> 34:43.040
Is this what you want?

34:43.040 --> 34:44.400
You monsters.

34:47.760 --> 34:49.520
Justin, I could really just listen to-

34:50.640 --> 34:53.600
It would be like Grammar Girl starring Justin McElroy,

34:53.600 --> 34:55.520
except you don't fucking know anything.

34:55.520 --> 34:56.400
Grammar goofus.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.800
Kelsey Grammar Girl.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.800
Now, this is a different show.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.440
This would be a different show from the show we just described.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.680
This is just a girl who loves Kelsey Grammar?

35:07.680 --> 35:10.880
This is a girl who sounds like a lot like Kelsey Grammar,

35:10.880 --> 35:12.480
and it's just her reading the newspaper.

35:13.840 --> 35:17.280
What about Kelsey Grammar Girl fan cast?

35:18.080 --> 35:19.520
We're going down the rabbit hole a little bit,

35:19.520 --> 35:22.160
but this is a fan cast about Kelsey Grammar Girl.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.400
This is dumb.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.760
The Muppet Show, World War II,

35:29.760 --> 35:33.520
the song I Knew You Were Waiting For Me by Aretha Franklin and George Michael.

35:33.520 --> 35:37.760
So many great things have come from the collaboration between the US and the UK,

35:37.760 --> 35:40.000
but never let us forget that at the heart of it all,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.800
our two nations are deadly rivals.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.280
Join me, Dave Holmes, for International Waters,

35:45.280 --> 35:48.320
a transatlantic panel game that pits comedians in London

35:48.320 --> 35:50.960
and comedians in Los Angeles against each other.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.480
It's like the Revolutionary War,

35:52.480 --> 35:55.840
but with way more jokes about One Direction and cinema.

35:55.840 --> 35:58.480
Find it in iTunes or at MaximumFun.org.

36:00.480 --> 36:03.200
Dear brothers, I have recently developed a strange fear

36:03.200 --> 36:06.160
that when I'm in the shower with the curtain drawn,

36:06.160 --> 36:08.240
there's a deranged killer in the bathroom that's about to kill me.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.720
How am I able to overcome this strange phobia

36:10.720 --> 36:12.480
so I can once again shower in peace?

36:12.480 --> 36:13.680
Any help is appreciated,

36:13.680 --> 36:15.520
as I have been carrying a fear in the corner of my shower,

36:15.520 --> 36:18.400
peeking out every three seconds to make sure there's no knife-wielding maniac

36:18.400 --> 36:20.640
in my bathroom, and that's from Andrew.

36:20.640 --> 36:21.360
Here's the thing.

36:21.360 --> 36:22.000
Can I be honest?

36:22.000 --> 36:25.040
The reason I included this question, not only is it a good question,

36:25.040 --> 36:26.320
I went through the same thing.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.480
How did you get out of it?

36:28.480 --> 36:33.840
Travis, it's the dorkiest shit, but I would put a song on the radio

36:33.840 --> 36:35.440
that was too happy to be murdered to.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.000
I was literally going to say, Travis,

36:38.000 --> 36:39.920
I was literally about to say,

36:39.920 --> 36:44.320
throw some fucking Beyonce on your iPhone and just blast it,

36:44.320 --> 36:45.600
because you're gonna, first of all,

36:45.600 --> 36:48.000
you're gonna love these tunes, I guarantee it.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.600
Second of all, you're gonna feel too fucking strong.

36:52.240 --> 36:54.480
You're gonna feel like if a killer did break into your room

36:54.480 --> 36:58.160
and fucking partition is blasting and a driver walks in that room,

36:58.160 --> 37:00.560
and pulls back the shower curtain and has a knife,

37:00.560 --> 37:03.920
you're like, I'm too fucking strong and way too fucking sexy

37:03.920 --> 37:05.280
to be killed in this shower right now.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.120
And then you're just dancing in his face.

37:07.680 --> 37:08.880
Or her face.

37:08.880 --> 37:09.520
Or her face.

37:09.520 --> 37:13.200
Whatever this killer is that's going to try and kill you,

37:13.200 --> 37:16.880
you're going to be dancing around their flurry of stabs,

37:16.880 --> 37:20.240
and you're gonna be so fucking strong and awesome while you do it.

37:21.360 --> 37:24.960
Honestly, that works for basically everything.

37:24.960 --> 37:28.640
It's basically why Beyonce is like a goddamn phenomenon.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.360
Everybody just wants to not get killed in their shower?

37:31.360 --> 37:33.680
Well, no, I'm saying it applies to fucking everything,

37:33.680 --> 37:35.680
like running across the interstate,

37:36.240 --> 37:38.800
like the hilarious Bowfinger movie.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.400
You put some fucking Beyonce on,

37:40.400 --> 37:43.680
the cars will just sort of fly around you,

37:43.680 --> 37:45.360
because you're too strong to be killed.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.240
Nobody has ever died while listening to a Beyonce song,

37:48.240 --> 37:51.360
because you're too strong and sexy and fucking powerful and awesome.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.920
I have a better idea than your ideas.

37:53.920 --> 37:57.600
Okay, for this, bring a knife into the shower.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.400
Never gonna see that coming.

38:00.400 --> 38:01.600
He pulls back the curtain like,

38:02.400 --> 38:04.320
and you're like, yourself, motherfucker,

38:04.320 --> 38:05.520
and stab him right in the eye.

38:05.520 --> 38:06.640
Oh, oh, okay.

38:06.640 --> 38:07.440
Let me one up that juice.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.120
You thought the psycho was out there?

38:09.120 --> 38:13.280
Surprise, the psycho's in here with the Irish spring on him.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.640
Let me one up that, Justin.

38:15.200 --> 38:15.760
You're gonna do a full on-

38:15.760 --> 38:18.320
That text should be the name of this fucking podcast, Travis.

38:18.320 --> 38:21.040
A full on home alone clown in the shower.

38:21.040 --> 38:21.280
Oh, fuck.

38:21.280 --> 38:21.840
What's that?

38:21.840 --> 38:23.040
You're in the closet.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.960
Stop, stop, stop.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.960
You jump out of the closet to stab him.

38:26.960 --> 38:27.680
What the fuck?

38:27.680 --> 38:28.880
He's a clown balloon.

38:28.880 --> 38:30.160
What's that on the ceiling?

38:30.160 --> 38:31.600
Daniel, why do you smell so bad?

38:31.600 --> 38:35.040
I haven't showered in three months, but I'm alive.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.720
Good news though, my clown's clean and my conscience is clear.

38:38.720 --> 38:41.520
My clown is clean?

38:41.520 --> 38:45.760
Now all you single ladies, come dance with Stinky, dude.

38:45.760 --> 38:49.120
I don't need the Beyonce to keep me sane anymore.

38:49.120 --> 38:52.160
I use the Beyonce to get me pumped up to kill somebody.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.000
Should they come into my shower to stab me?

38:54.640 --> 38:59.040
As long as they aren't a clown balloon and they are perched on the ceiling.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.840
Oh no, shit, that's a second clown balloon.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.800
They double ballooned me.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.840
The floor is a mirror the whole time.

39:05.840 --> 39:11.120
A mirror, they are the house and then they eat me, monster house.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.680
The house was a metaphor for my childhood.

39:15.680 --> 39:18.800
Wait a second, this is all a dream, but it's not.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.400
The killer's inside my dream.

39:20.400 --> 39:24.800
I'm John Cusack and all of a sudden the house is floating.

39:24.800 --> 39:29.120
Look up, balloons, you're in up as he moved.

39:29.120 --> 39:32.640
You're trapped in the television clicking through with your magical remote.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.440
Sorry, Pleasantville?

39:35.440 --> 39:39.680
No, that was more of, I think it was, no, it wasn't mom and dad saved the universe.

39:39.680 --> 39:42.640
I think you definitely meant Pleasantville.

39:42.640 --> 39:46.240
Channel up, next channel, change channel, channel changes.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.920
Channel changes, do you guys want to Yahoo?

39:47.920 --> 39:50.080
Yeah.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.240
This Yahoo was sent in by John Williams.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.440
Thank you, John Williams.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.840
It's by Yahoo answers user Easton who asks,

39:58.400 --> 40:03.520
what are some sexy foods besides hot dogs, pickles, et cetera?

40:03.520 --> 40:05.440
Of, so it's of.

40:06.320 --> 40:09.120
For example, a hot dog, a pickle.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.880
You just said that, so you're kind of being all right on it.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.920
For example, a hot dog, a pickle, a melon.

40:15.920 --> 40:17.440
Mm.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.680
Those can all be used as another meaning.

40:20.720 --> 40:24.240
What are some other foods than can be used that way?

40:24.240 --> 40:26.160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.680
This is posted in men's health.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.040
Wait, wait, wait.

40:29.040 --> 40:29.600
I, okay.

40:30.160 --> 40:34.320
I thought this question I asked her was saying not hot dogs and pickles

40:34.320 --> 40:36.480
because of their inherently phallic nature.

40:36.480 --> 40:40.000
But if they're trying to suggest, if they're trying to suggest

40:40.000 --> 40:44.720
that saying like I want to be all over your hot dog

40:44.720 --> 40:48.160
is in any way sexual, they're the worst.

40:48.160 --> 40:50.160
A, A, A, A.

40:50.160 --> 40:51.840
Let me see that melon.

40:51.840 --> 40:52.800
The, my what?

40:53.680 --> 40:55.920
Your, your honey do.

40:55.920 --> 40:56.320
My what?

40:56.320 --> 40:58.560
I like your melons.

40:58.560 --> 40:59.600
I gotta go.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.120
I have to leave.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.720
I'm having a pickle problem.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.520
I'm just gonna name foods.

41:05.520 --> 41:06.080
All right.

41:06.080 --> 41:08.480
And you guys tell me gut instinct.

41:08.480 --> 41:08.720
Okay.

41:08.720 --> 41:09.680
Don't think about it.

41:09.680 --> 41:09.920
Okay.

41:09.920 --> 41:10.640
Gut instinct.

41:10.640 --> 41:11.280
Let me clear my mind.

41:11.280 --> 41:13.680
Is there anything sexual or a sexual connotation

41:13.680 --> 41:17.280
or a euphemism, whatever, sexual connotation to these foods?

41:17.280 --> 41:17.600
Here's your-

41:17.600 --> 41:20.160
Well, we need to back this up or is it just like gut reaction?

41:20.160 --> 41:20.720
Yes or no?

41:21.360 --> 41:22.240
Uh, no.

41:22.240 --> 41:22.640
Yeah.

41:22.640 --> 41:23.120
Gut reaction.

41:23.120 --> 41:23.600
Yes or no?

41:23.600 --> 41:25.520
If I completely disagree with you, I will stop.

41:25.520 --> 41:27.680
I got kind of a hair trigger down there though.

41:27.680 --> 41:31.680
So chicken salad.

41:31.680 --> 41:35.280
No, no, no, no.

41:35.280 --> 41:35.840
Okay.

41:35.840 --> 41:36.800
Pretzels.

41:36.800 --> 41:37.360
Yes.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.520
No pretzel rods.

41:39.520 --> 41:39.920
Yes.

41:39.920 --> 41:42.160
Yes.

41:42.160 --> 41:44.240
Anything, any rod, any cucumber rod.

41:44.240 --> 41:45.840
Well, cucumber is, I guess, we're on shumber.

41:45.840 --> 41:46.960
It's just a rod shape.

41:46.960 --> 41:47.280
Okay.

41:47.280 --> 41:47.840
Cucumber.

41:47.840 --> 41:48.160
Yeah.

41:48.160 --> 41:48.480
Yes.

41:49.120 --> 41:49.840
Jello.

41:49.840 --> 41:50.080
Yes.

41:50.080 --> 41:50.400
Yes.

41:50.960 --> 41:51.600
Jelly.

41:51.600 --> 41:51.920
Yes.

41:51.920 --> 41:52.240
Yes.

41:52.800 --> 41:53.680
Jam.

41:53.680 --> 41:53.920
Yes.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.280
You're just saying, okay.

41:55.280 --> 41:55.920
No, I'm not.

41:55.920 --> 41:56.720
Yes.

41:56.720 --> 41:57.840
Just, okay.

41:57.840 --> 41:58.960
Peanut butter.

41:58.960 --> 41:59.280
No.

41:59.280 --> 41:59.680
Yes.

41:59.680 --> 42:00.000
Huh.

42:00.880 --> 42:01.280
Okay.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.640
Split decision on that.

42:02.640 --> 42:03.840
I'm into it.

42:03.840 --> 42:04.560
Half and half.

42:05.200 --> 42:05.600
No.

42:05.600 --> 42:06.560
Are you just looking at-

42:06.560 --> 42:06.800
Wait.

42:06.800 --> 42:09.840
Are you saying it's a split decision or the food half and half?

42:09.840 --> 42:12.800
I'm not sure anymore.

42:12.800 --> 42:18.960
I want to read some of these answers that have been submitted in response to this Yahoo

42:18.960 --> 42:28.400
Knights mystery because one of them is the greatest and, well, it's the worst thing.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.160
It's the worst paragraph ever pinned.

42:31.520 --> 42:35.760
Less offensive are chocolate ding dongs, obviously.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.120
That's from Vatim S.

42:37.120 --> 42:38.800
Olivia says, a host is Twinkie.

42:38.800 --> 42:42.320
They are tan-ish and white creamy stuff comes out of them.

42:42.320 --> 42:43.200
Oh.

42:43.200 --> 42:48.320
UOM says, try a banana or a cumber.

42:48.320 --> 42:51.680
It's just, I guess, or a cumber.

42:51.680 --> 42:54.560
How into cucumbers do you need to-

42:54.560 --> 42:56.640
Hey, let me get some of those cumbers.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.800
Hey, you got any cumbers over there?

42:58.800 --> 43:02.240
Richie just says, cream.

43:02.240 --> 43:04.640
Sorry, what?

43:04.640 --> 43:09.040
Cream?

43:11.840 --> 43:18.560
I want to read, though, this new American classic from Spanky Gaspacho DW.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.400
This was rated the top answer.

43:23.120 --> 43:25.120
It has four thumbs up, zero thumbs down.

43:25.120 --> 43:29.360
The asker gave it one out of five stars, though, so it's a bit contentious.

43:29.360 --> 43:34.080
It is not the answer that the asker wanted, but it is the answer they deserved.

43:35.040 --> 43:37.280
Spanky Gaspacho DW says-

43:37.280 --> 43:40.640
Say that name just eight more times.

43:40.640 --> 43:42.400
Spanky Gaspacho DW.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.440
That's an answer right there.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.880
Yeah, and he was also my favorite little rascal.

43:46.880 --> 43:52.720
Spanky Gaspacho DW says, and please just let me get through this.

43:55.920 --> 43:57.440
Mango is really sexy.

43:57.440 --> 43:59.520
Mango is really sexy.

44:01.200 --> 44:03.920
Don't cut it up and eat it with a fork, though.

44:05.120 --> 44:12.640
You have to let the juice drip down your face and onto your naked rack.

44:17.120 --> 44:21.920
You have to suck on that seed, you know?

44:21.920 --> 44:30.000
You know, share it visually and expressively, and then literally.

44:32.560 --> 44:42.640
Nothing, nothing better than a beautiful sweet mango smeared all over the body

44:44.240 --> 44:47.600
and slowly kissed and licked off.

44:47.600 --> 44:53.520
What are you doing in there, Spanky?

44:53.520 --> 44:55.120
Not you, I'm internet.

44:55.120 --> 44:56.080
I'm researching.

44:57.200 --> 45:00.000
Come down for dinner, we're having mango for dessert.

45:00.000 --> 45:00.960
Oh, Christ.

45:04.720 --> 45:07.520
My boner, it went inside.

45:07.520 --> 45:12.240
I'm sharing it visually and expressively, and then literally.

45:12.240 --> 45:18.160
What does that mean, Spanky Gaspacho DW?

45:18.160 --> 45:20.880
Can I just quickly, like quick sidebar?

45:20.880 --> 45:24.480
I did a Googleroo of Spanky Gaspacho.

45:24.480 --> 45:28.960
This is a unique individual haunting Yahoo answers.

45:30.080 --> 45:36.320
There is a question, the top response for Spanky Gaspacho is the question,

45:36.320 --> 45:41.600
does anybody here know someone that is nicknamed Gaspacho?

45:41.600 --> 45:43.840
Well, you do now.

45:43.840 --> 45:47.680
The top answer is from Spanky Gaspacho.

45:47.680 --> 45:51.200
He says, I see Gaspacho that is that cold,

45:51.200 --> 45:54.640
emotionless, acidic tomato-based soupy guy, Gazy,

45:54.640 --> 45:57.600
that got all suspended by Yamster on Christmas day.

45:58.160 --> 46:01.280
Obviously a beaten up individual bruised by years of haunting,

46:01.840 --> 46:05.920
not like a sweet, juicy, dribbling tropical mango man

46:05.920 --> 46:09.040
smothered with affection from caring and giving strangers

46:09.040 --> 46:10.800
who have taken him under their wing.

46:10.800 --> 46:13.760
A truly one side affair for which he is overwhelmingly

46:13.760 --> 46:16.960
the person who takes the benefit of other's selflessness.

46:16.960 --> 46:17.280
What?

46:17.280 --> 46:17.840
What?

46:17.840 --> 46:22.480
Wait, is this motherfucker just like a prophet for mangoes?

46:22.480 --> 46:27.200
I think this motherfucker is an artificial intelligence who is-

46:27.200 --> 46:32.560
A very slowly and surprisingly sensually becoming self-aware.

46:32.560 --> 46:42.080
Are you telling me right now that Spanky Gaspacho was created-

46:42.080 --> 46:42.960
In a laboratory.

46:42.960 --> 46:43.440
Absolutely.

46:43.440 --> 46:43.920
In a lab.

46:45.680 --> 46:46.960
Okay, I buy it.

46:46.960 --> 46:49.920
Is it possible that what the deal is,

46:49.920 --> 46:53.680
is that Spanky Gaspacho represents everything that's wrong with humanity

46:53.680 --> 46:57.760
and he realizes or she realizes that Mango,

46:58.480 --> 47:02.480
that Mango boy or whatever they said was the other person,

47:02.480 --> 47:04.320
is all the good, right?

47:04.320 --> 47:06.960
And while they're in a constant luck struggle

47:06.960 --> 47:10.000
with their icy nature versus the juicy nature,

47:10.720 --> 47:16.160
Spanky Gaspacho also realizes the beauty and wonder that is Mango

47:16.160 --> 47:18.560
and wishes they could just be closer to them

47:18.560 --> 47:22.080
but knows that their yin and yang like structure

47:22.080 --> 47:25.520
stops them from ever actually consummating the relationship.

47:25.520 --> 47:31.600
That was, Travis, the fucking craziest thing you've ever said.

47:32.640 --> 47:35.600
We have done this podcast for 242-

47:35.600 --> 47:41.200
And you literally just created a goddamn bonkers religion

47:42.800 --> 47:46.080
around some whack Yahoo Answers shit that you just found.

47:46.800 --> 47:49.040
I'm just saying that it's easy for us to judge

47:49.040 --> 47:50.480
when we don't know the whole story.

47:51.760 --> 47:54.640
Okay, I'll do- I'll test that theory.

47:54.640 --> 47:55.920
You're an insane person.

47:56.720 --> 47:58.240
You're right, that was easy.

47:58.240 --> 47:59.760
I judged you like that.

47:59.760 --> 48:02.800
But, Travis, I was having a dissociative episode

48:02.800 --> 48:06.080
while you were talking because I was so unable

48:06.080 --> 48:08.240
to process the words coming out of your mouth.

48:08.240 --> 48:11.120
This podcast is now officially this episode.

48:11.120 --> 48:12.320
I thought we had some pretty good stuff.

48:12.320 --> 48:14.080
Adam Levine goofs, I'm into it.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.320
Now it's the ring and if you listen to it,

48:16.320 --> 48:17.600
you die seven days later.

48:17.600 --> 48:19.920
You know what, what you said was so fucking weird.

48:19.920 --> 48:22.560
You know what, history will prove one of us right

48:22.560 --> 48:24.240
and one of us wrong, Justin.

48:24.240 --> 48:26.240
Yeah, it's gonna prove you right.

48:26.240 --> 48:28.320
Because Justin's gonna be fucking dead and so am I.

48:28.320 --> 48:30.240
And so is our millions of listeners

48:30.240 --> 48:32.320
unless they get somebody else to listen to our podcast.

48:32.320 --> 48:35.760
But not me because Mango will have welcomed me

48:35.760 --> 48:40.000
into their arms and taken me away from this gazpacho-y planet.

48:41.360 --> 48:43.840
We get cold and icy human beings.

48:43.840 --> 48:45.920
This is great viral marketing, I guess,

48:45.920 --> 48:47.600
unless all of our listeners die,

48:47.600 --> 48:49.840
in which case it's bad viral marketing.

48:49.840 --> 48:55.120
Oh, we have one more money zone from the Mango Council.

48:55.120 --> 48:56.640
Folks, thank you so much for listening

48:56.640 --> 48:57.920
to my brother, my brother, and me.

48:58.960 --> 49:00.800
Want to say a huge thanks to Nature Box.

49:00.800 --> 49:01.920
You can get your free sample box

49:01.920 --> 49:03.600
of great tasting wholesome snacks

49:03.600 --> 49:05.120
like BBQ kettle kernels.

49:05.120 --> 49:07.520
Go to naturebox.com or fuck those.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.600
Get some Parmesan garlic pop pops.

49:09.600 --> 49:12.800
Well, don't say fuck those about the BBQ kettle kernels.

49:13.920 --> 49:15.600
I don't think you should fuck the kettle kernels.

49:15.600 --> 49:17.760
You could try some mango almond bites

49:17.760 --> 49:21.040
or some mango fruit chews or some dried mango.

49:22.240 --> 49:23.280
Or some mango.

49:24.320 --> 49:25.360
All available at Nature Box.

49:25.360 --> 49:26.800
Dried mango is not going to give you

49:26.800 --> 49:28.240
the kind of juice that you need

49:28.240 --> 49:30.880
to perform your fucking sacrament.

49:31.520 --> 49:33.280
You're going to have to get the dried mango

49:33.280 --> 49:36.000
and then soak it in the holy wine overnight.

49:36.000 --> 49:36.880
What's the holy wine?

49:36.880 --> 49:40.000
I'll post all the instructions on the Facebook page.

49:40.800 --> 49:43.200
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

49:43.200 --> 49:45.440
This isn't even like idiosyncratic

49:45.440 --> 49:48.960
and like, wow, what a weird tangent they went off on.

49:48.960 --> 49:50.560
Which is what I think all of our listeners

49:50.560 --> 49:51.840
sound like apparently in my head.

49:53.120 --> 49:56.560
This is like, Travis, you are on some like

49:57.520 --> 49:59.280
Charles Manson shit right now.

49:59.920 --> 50:02.080
And I'm like wicked uncomfortable with it.

50:02.080 --> 50:03.600
Yeah, I don't even think it's funny.

50:03.600 --> 50:04.880
I don't think it's funny either.

50:04.880 --> 50:05.520
It's terrifying.

50:05.520 --> 50:07.280
It's fucking terrifying, yeah.

50:07.280 --> 50:08.560
I don't know what you want me to say.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.360
I don't even know where these words are coming from.

50:11.360 --> 50:13.520
It's like some greater forces just speaking through me.

50:13.520 --> 50:14.160
You know what I mean?

50:14.160 --> 50:17.360
I just opened my mouth and the wisdom comes out.

50:17.360 --> 50:20.480
So you've been in LA for all of like three months

50:20.480 --> 50:23.040
and you're already founding Scientology 2.

50:23.040 --> 50:24.800
That's so cool.

50:24.800 --> 50:26.720
This motherfucker's not even founding Scientology 2.

50:26.720 --> 50:28.640
It's like he's discovered like some fucking

50:29.200 --> 50:32.160
some fucking curves and angles that are alien to our world.

50:32.160 --> 50:35.040
Like this motherfucker is like on some fucking

50:35.760 --> 50:38.320
Miskatonic shit like Arkham Horror.

50:38.320 --> 50:43.200
Like fucking Cthulhu talking like crazy cult shit.

50:43.200 --> 50:45.520
Like a new color between orange and yellow

50:45.520 --> 50:46.640
that's just been there the whole time.

50:46.640 --> 50:47.680
It's called mango.

50:47.680 --> 50:50.800
You're on some fucking rats in the wall shit

50:50.800 --> 50:52.560
and I'm losing my mind.

50:52.560 --> 50:53.280
I will never-

50:53.280 --> 50:54.720
At the mouth of mango.

50:54.720 --> 50:55.760
That's where you're at.

50:55.760 --> 50:58.720
We're all teetering on the mouth of mango right now.

51:00.400 --> 51:04.080
I will never stop doing this podcast for my entire life.

51:04.080 --> 51:05.200
As long as all three of us are alive,

51:05.200 --> 51:06.400
we'll continue to do this podcast.

51:06.400 --> 51:07.280
That's my promise to you.

51:08.080 --> 51:10.880
I wish to God this could be our final episode

51:10.880 --> 51:13.920
because this would be the best,

51:13.920 --> 51:17.920
the craziest finale of a podcast ever.

51:17.920 --> 51:19.120
Worse than Seinfeld.

51:19.680 --> 51:20.560
Hands down.

51:20.560 --> 51:22.000
Zero stars.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.760
Would not recommend F-minus.

51:25.280 --> 51:28.160
I hope this is the episode that somebody gives to a friend

51:28.160 --> 51:30.480
that's like man you gotta listen to the show.

51:30.480 --> 51:31.840
You gotta listen to the show.

51:31.840 --> 51:32.880
Oh God I'm safe.

51:37.840 --> 51:38.240
Get it?

51:38.240 --> 51:39.760
Get it?

51:39.760 --> 51:40.800
Oh Jesus.

51:44.640 --> 51:46.160
We're doing two live shows.

51:46.160 --> 51:47.200
If you're not dead,

51:47.200 --> 51:49.360
if you go to MBMBAM Chicago,

51:50.880 --> 51:53.520
bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Chicago.

51:53.520 --> 51:55.600
Doing a show there on April 5th.

51:55.600 --> 51:56.400
We saw bones.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.560
Bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM,

51:58.560 --> 51:59.280
or sorry.

51:59.280 --> 52:03.040
Bit.ly forward slash M-I-L-M-B-M-B-A-M

52:03.040 --> 52:05.280
and that'll let you get tickets for our show

52:05.280 --> 52:08.640
at Turner Hall Ballroom in Milwaukee.

52:08.640 --> 52:11.840
Tickets that are basically almost sold out.

52:11.840 --> 52:14.640
Like so if you hear this and you wanna go,

52:14.640 --> 52:16.080
like go get tickets right now

52:16.080 --> 52:17.120
because they are,

52:17.120 --> 52:19.120
I mean out of last count where were they?

52:19.120 --> 52:20.000
They were.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.040
Yeah we have like 10 left.

52:21.920 --> 52:23.680
And we're also doing a show in Minnesota

52:23.680 --> 52:24.640
or in Minneapolis,

52:24.640 --> 52:26.400
but we're already sold out on that one.

52:26.400 --> 52:29.200
But we do need questions for all three shows.

52:29.200 --> 52:30.880
So if you're going to be at the shows,

52:30.880 --> 52:35.880
send us an email, MBMBAM at maximumfund.org

52:37.440 --> 52:39.520
and make sure to put in the subject line

52:39.520 --> 52:41.440
like for Chicago live show,

52:41.440 --> 52:44.800
for Minneapolis live show or for Milwaukee live show.

52:44.800 --> 52:46.480
So we make sure to ask the questions

52:46.480 --> 52:48.080
at the right ones that you're gonna be at.

52:48.080 --> 52:50.080
We'll also be taking some audience questions

52:50.080 --> 52:52.160
which if you haven't been to a live show in the past

52:52.160 --> 52:53.760
come with the question ready.

52:53.760 --> 52:54.720
Not a bummer.

52:54.720 --> 52:58.160
It's gotta be happy and an actual question for advice.

52:58.160 --> 53:01.280
Not something like, you know,

53:01.280 --> 53:04.240
why do you think such and such did such and such?

53:04.240 --> 53:06.400
We've got a couple of those questions this week

53:06.400 --> 53:08.480
which they're very funny to read,

53:08.480 --> 53:11.360
but they're not very actionable as far as advice goes.

53:11.360 --> 53:13.040
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

53:13.040 --> 53:14.640
who used for our theme song is Departure

53:14.640 --> 53:15.920
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

53:16.960 --> 53:18.560
It is a terrific album.

53:19.760 --> 53:22.320
I'm still waiting on that new shit someday.

53:22.320 --> 53:23.200
Some day we're gonna get it.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.240
I was listening to the other night

53:24.240 --> 53:25.920
having a dinner party and my friends like cool album.

53:25.920 --> 53:27.120
I was like, thanks.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.960
I didn't record it, but I purchased it.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.520
No, you should just say you recorded it.

53:31.520 --> 53:32.720
We've got Max Fund Drive.

53:34.240 --> 53:35.840
I am John Roderick.

53:36.960 --> 53:38.320
We've got Max Fund Drive coming up.

53:38.320 --> 53:40.880
It starts the 16th and it runs for two weeks.

53:40.880 --> 53:42.560
Max Fund Drive is your opportunity

53:42.560 --> 53:45.120
to support all of the amazing Max Fund shows.

53:45.680 --> 53:46.720
And it's our chance to give you

53:46.720 --> 53:48.560
some of our best content of the year.

53:48.560 --> 53:50.640
And if you become a new donor

53:50.640 --> 53:52.080
or if you upgrade your donation

53:52.080 --> 53:55.680
you're gonna get some really incredible pledge gifts.

53:55.680 --> 53:57.680
In the past, there's been things like tote bags

53:57.680 --> 54:00.480
and like really cool Max Fund engraved tumblers

54:00.480 --> 54:01.200
and stuff like that.

54:02.320 --> 54:04.800
So there's all different levels of donation

54:04.800 --> 54:05.920
and all of it helps.

54:06.960 --> 54:09.200
And so starting the 16th running for two weeks

54:09.200 --> 54:10.880
we're gonna ask you to really step up

54:10.880 --> 54:13.680
and to commit to some monthly donations

54:13.680 --> 54:15.920
and we'll keep doing awesome shows

54:15.920 --> 54:17.360
and entertaining you for the year.

54:17.360 --> 54:18.320
So don't miss it.

54:18.320 --> 54:18.880
Don't miss it.

54:18.880 --> 54:21.840
Just keep an eye on maximumfund.org for all the details.

54:21.840 --> 54:25.360
And like, and growing.

54:25.360 --> 54:27.840
Like we have been able to grow

54:28.880 --> 54:30.960
not just like this show where we've been able

54:30.960 --> 54:34.720
to like plan and do live show mini tours

54:34.720 --> 54:35.600
and stuff like that

54:35.600 --> 54:37.760
but like stuff like the Adventure Zone

54:37.760 --> 54:39.840
and Bunker Buddies and Sawbones.

54:39.840 --> 54:42.160
Like we have started doing all of that stuff

54:42.160 --> 54:43.040
since we joined Max Fund

54:43.040 --> 54:47.040
because we have the freedom and the support to do it

54:47.040 --> 54:48.640
because of these donations.

54:48.640 --> 54:51.040
Quite literally, like because of the donations

54:51.040 --> 54:53.440
like I was able to move here

54:53.440 --> 54:56.880
and advance a lot of stuff for all of our podcasts

54:56.880 --> 54:58.240
and start a lot of new stuff.

54:58.240 --> 55:02.480
So like it really does go to support the shows you love.

55:02.480 --> 55:04.160
Yeah, thank you all.

55:04.160 --> 55:04.880
Thank you all very, very much.

55:04.880 --> 55:08.160
Speaking of go listen to the other Max Fund shows

55:08.160 --> 55:09.120
My Brother and My Brother and Me

55:09.120 --> 55:10.960
you already listened to but check out the Adventure Zone.

55:10.960 --> 55:12.560
Did you just say My Brother and My Brother and Me?

55:12.560 --> 55:13.280
Oh, My Brother and My Brother and Me?

55:13.280 --> 55:14.960
Yeah, I'm, Griffin at this point

55:14.960 --> 55:16.880
I'm doing three Max Fund podcasts.

55:16.880 --> 55:18.480
It's always hard to keep track of which show

55:18.480 --> 55:19.680
I'm doing at any given time.

55:19.680 --> 55:23.200
So Adventure Zone, where we play D&D with our dad.

55:24.160 --> 55:26.480
We're gonna have some special Pledge Drive episodes

55:26.480 --> 55:27.360
coming up with that.

55:27.360 --> 55:29.840
Bunker Buddies that I do with Andy Bolt

55:29.840 --> 55:32.480
where we talk about survival stuff.

55:32.480 --> 55:34.400
Justin does Sawbones.

55:34.400 --> 55:37.840
I have been on a Sawbones binge lately.

55:37.840 --> 55:40.560
Listened to like eight episodes in the last two days.

55:40.560 --> 55:41.360
Thank you.

55:41.360 --> 55:41.840
You're welcome.

55:41.840 --> 55:42.960
He does that with his wife, Sydney.

55:42.960 --> 55:45.760
It's a comedy medical show

55:45.760 --> 55:48.080
about like the fucked up history of medicine.

55:48.080 --> 55:49.760
It's really amazing.

55:49.760 --> 55:51.920
It's Teresa's favorite show on the network.

55:51.920 --> 55:52.880
Burn.

55:52.880 --> 55:55.120
That's right, Rachel's too, I think.

55:55.120 --> 55:55.680
That's cool.

55:55.680 --> 55:57.360
So listen to those, listen to Flophouse,

55:57.360 --> 55:58.240
listen to Throwing Shade,

55:58.240 --> 56:00.080

56:00.080 --> 56:01.600
Are we done?

56:01.600 --> 56:03.840
Yep, here, here's a final Yahoo for you.

56:03.840 --> 56:05.120
Don't leave home without it.

56:05.120 --> 56:05.680
Hit me.

56:05.680 --> 56:09.120
This Yahoo was sent in by level 400,000

56:09.120 --> 56:12.160
Yajru Druid, Drew Davenport.

56:12.160 --> 56:13.520
It's a lot of Drews in there now.

56:13.520 --> 56:14.160
Thank you, Drew.

56:14.160 --> 56:17.440
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Dave something.

56:17.440 --> 56:18.800
Dave, something's gone wrong.

56:18.800 --> 56:21.280
It says, I haven't seen this error message before,

56:21.280 --> 56:24.160
but I'm highlighting their name to see what the name is.

56:24.160 --> 56:25.680
And all I'm getting is sorry.

56:25.680 --> 56:27.280
It appears something's gone wrong.

56:27.280 --> 56:28.880
Yeah, something's gone terribly wrong

56:28.880 --> 56:31.840
because I'm on Yahoo Answers fucking professionally.

56:33.360 --> 56:35.280
Anyway, this mystery user asks,

56:36.640 --> 56:40.320
my son acts like Kramer from Seinfeld.

56:40.320 --> 56:41.280

57:17.600 --> 57:19.440
in programs and opportunities

57:19.440 --> 57:21.360
that you need to seize today.

57:21.360 --> 57:22.880
You're a taxpayer, right?

57:22.880 --> 57:24.400
Well, then you've got it coming.

57:24.400 --> 57:26.880
Thanks to Uncle Sam, you can learn to

57:26.880 --> 57:28.560

Learn to ride a llama.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.480
Print money the old fashioned way.

57:32.480 --> 57:35.600
Force your dog to stop being so rambunctious.
