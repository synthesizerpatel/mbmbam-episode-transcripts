00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better, it's better with you

01:00.300 --> 01:02.300

01:55.680 --> 01:59.640
Well spring is finally here and that can only mean one thing around this house

02:00.200 --> 02:06.680
Which is my house where I live. Okay, it's advice season has begun spring means advice here at the McElroy family. Sure

02:06.680 --> 02:10.800
Yeah, my my kids are always running up to me like daddy. What's uh?

02:10.800 --> 02:15.920
What's what's a good trade skill to learn if I want to be

02:16.320 --> 02:20.920
Valuable to society in the future and I I always tell them the same thing

02:21.640 --> 02:23.640
stucco

02:23.920 --> 02:28.560
See, I just started saying VR technician and I don't exactly know what that means

02:28.560 --> 02:34.280
But I think by the time BB's old enough to get a job VR technician will be a thing, right?

02:34.280 --> 02:41.460
Nah, people are gonna get so sick of strapping bullshit to their faces. All's it's gonna take is for one of these damn

02:42.120 --> 02:50.040
Oculi to blow up on someone's head and then people like no, thanks, but stucco that's going absolutely nowhere, baby

02:50.520 --> 02:57.400
Now you're saying stucco over say like somebody who was specialized in like drywall or a gypsum or even drywall

02:58.440 --> 03:01.200
Fucking drywall is fucking bullshit

03:01.200 --> 03:04.880
Yeah, all stucco all the time. Now. Do I know what stucco is? I

03:05.840 --> 03:12.980
Refuse to answer that question. Okay, I'm gonna start working that into every answer that we give just like learning trade

03:13.240 --> 03:14.680
Okay

03:14.680 --> 03:20.240
It's so applicable learn a trade learn how to do stuck. What do you wish you knew how to do Justin?

03:20.240 --> 03:25.320
Cuz you know you I mean you've picked it up carpentry now, so let's let's not count that. Yeah

03:25.320 --> 03:30.720
Yeah, drywall. No, we already discussed. It's kind of like I already said drywall

03:30.720 --> 03:35.320
But I was just saying I also would like to learn how to do drywall. Yeah, see for me

03:35.320 --> 03:41.480
It's electrics and I'll tell you why oh don't fuck around with that. Yeah, but here's here's the thing

03:41.480 --> 03:46.760
I feel like if you don't know what you're doing with plumbing and you don't know what you're doing with drywall and you don't

03:46.760 --> 03:50.440
Know what you're doing with a lot of things. The worst you're going to do is ruin it

03:50.440 --> 03:55.440
If you don't know what you're doing with electrics, you could die and kill others

03:55.600 --> 04:00.720
Well, if you could make a big enough plumbing, well, I could make a big enough plumbing whoopsie to die

04:00.720 --> 04:04.800
I bet like a low poison of mold that is huge

04:06.520 --> 04:11.680
I'm saying I break the toilet so bad the water shoots up at me with such force it just it kills me

04:11.680 --> 04:13.680
That's that's entirely possible

04:13.680 --> 04:17.760
But I could never learn plumbing because I would always be afraid that no matter what

04:17.760 --> 04:24.520
Fixture I'm working on where the pipe is that I'm doing it. I'm gonna remove it and water's gonna come out and also

04:25.980 --> 04:29.620
Human waste even if it's like the kitchen sink pipes

04:29.620 --> 04:34.040
I do not know how the water gets there where it's coming from. You know what? I mean?

04:34.040 --> 04:37.100
I don't know anything about plumbing but but yeah

04:37.360 --> 04:41.520
Movies and TV have convinced me that if I remove something wrong

04:41.520 --> 04:48.520
It will spray at me with such force. It might cause me physical pain. You could die. That's what I'm saying stucco though

04:49.040 --> 04:53.160
Fully safe you could eat that stuff. I bet I was about to ask if you could eat it

04:53.160 --> 04:55.620
Yeah, I'm sure it's got it's got nutrients

04:55.720 --> 05:01.000
They and they would call me the stucco bucko and I would roll up on their house and I would put stucco all over it

05:01.000 --> 05:03.600
And they'd be like we had exposed brick and I would say

05:04.480 --> 05:07.120
Not anymore. You don't know you have hidden brick

05:07.120 --> 05:14.120
Are we fucking are we done? Are we like are we like I this?

05:14.120 --> 05:17.160
I feel like the last few intros has been like discussing

05:18.440 --> 05:24.960
Finances and now we're it's literally home and we're literally making home improvement to we're literally making

05:24.960 --> 05:29.320
Well, the problem is we haven't had any new input in about 13 months

05:29.720 --> 05:36.320
Yeah, I've heard some people I've read on Twitter. Some people are like the quality of the show has really been flagging that well

05:36.320 --> 05:39.920
That's weird since I began my self imprisonment. Yeah

05:40.640 --> 05:47.200
My year-long self imprisonment the the the laughs haven't been as plentiful on the show

05:47.760 --> 05:51.760
All I've got is like hey, have you ever noticed how on this one wall next to my desk?

05:51.760 --> 05:56.560
There's this weird discoloration that kind of looks a little bit like dick butt kiss, you know

05:56.560 --> 05:58.560
Like that's the best I've got at this point

05:58.840 --> 06:05.440
But don't worry folks as soon as I get that good juice in my arm. I'm talking about that Johnson and Johnson shit

06:05.440 --> 06:07.440
I am going to

06:07.440 --> 06:08.720
way

06:08.720 --> 06:13.800
Overcorrect, so just stick with us cuz I'm gonna I'm gonna start going to raves and shit

06:13.800 --> 06:20.480
Like it's gonna be it's gonna be something to see. Yeah, I've got the juice. I've got the juice

06:20.480 --> 06:27.160
It's pumping through me. I ain't afraid of no bugs, right? I got the juice. It's pumping through me. There's nothing to do

06:28.040 --> 06:33.840
It's I got I went outside for a little bit. I was like, I remember this this was fine, too

06:33.840 --> 06:39.320
Yeah, but like the masks I can't tell if you're smart. I have a hard enough time with emotions

06:39.320 --> 06:44.360
Yeah, you know what I mean figuring out how people are feeling and now I'm looking at these strangers eyes trying to guess how much

06:44.360 --> 06:46.360
They dislike me, right?

06:46.880 --> 06:51.480
It's very stressful, you know speaking of this can I can I begin with a much quad? Oh, yeah

06:51.480 --> 06:56.440
Oh, yeah, I

06:59.880 --> 07:01.880
Want a much

07:04.040 --> 07:06.040
What I want a much

07:07.600 --> 07:14.100
Squad squad so excited about this. Are you all excited about this? Are you so excited that you just said I want a munch

07:14.100 --> 07:21.620
It's the my lunch school one with your host Justin

07:22.100 --> 07:27.660
Did you hear what Krispy Kreme's doing? What's Krispy Kreme doing? Hey, you guys hear about this you guys hear about this

07:27.660 --> 07:31.060
You hear about this is a good. This is a good one. This one will make you happy

07:32.040 --> 07:33.160
Okay

07:33.160 --> 07:37.460
Krispy Kreme's got a new got a new promotion going on where if you get the job

07:37.460 --> 07:43.540
You get the vaccine. Uh-huh. You're gonna come in for a year and get free donut every day. Whoa

07:44.020 --> 07:47.540
Why show them your for you? Show them your vaccination card?

07:47.540 --> 07:52.940
You're gonna get a free original glazed donut every single day for a year

07:53.060 --> 07:57.340
You're doing something good for you doing something good for your community doing something bad for you

07:57.340 --> 08:07.060
Circular circular that's here's how it works you bring in your vaccine card to a Krispy Kreme

08:07.620 --> 08:10.260
You get one free original glazed donut

08:11.020 --> 08:13.520
That's the promotion every day though for a year

08:14.740 --> 08:18.620
Yeah, so I I hear your questions and we're gonna head to the FAQ

08:18.620 --> 08:26.700
What call here's the first cue what qualifies is vaccinated? Oh, that's a bad start. That's a bad start

08:27.560 --> 08:31.920
Anyone who has received at least one of the two shots of Moderna or Pfizer?

08:32.260 --> 08:37.040
COVID-19 vaccine or one shot of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine now

08:37.040 --> 08:39.940
I am rocking this off-brand AstraZeneca

08:42.100 --> 08:45.900
Legal yeah, this is not a promotion that I could take advantage of right now

08:45.900 --> 08:52.340
You know the approves you've been vaccinated by showing them your vaccination record card. Okay?

08:53.340 --> 09:00.620
Does my vaccine sticker qualify now if you get a sticker that says I got vaccinated that's nothing

09:01.300 --> 09:03.660
To Krispy Kreme. That's nothing

09:04.260 --> 09:10.500
Right. I guess my question is is this a like government subsidized like program how?

09:11.460 --> 09:14.180
Yeah, how is Krispy Kreme not going to go out of business?

09:14.180 --> 09:15.380
Oh

09:15.380 --> 09:18.660
Well, I guess they're banking on a lot of people not getting vaccinated

09:19.380 --> 09:22.760
Everybody who doesn't give vaccinated as money in their coffers

09:22.760 --> 09:24.760
So this is kind of hedging their bets either

09:25.300 --> 09:29.300
Either it's good because everybody gets vaccinated or it's good because not as many people take their free down

09:29.300 --> 09:34.120
But this is what I'm saying if at every Krispy Kreme location only 20 people do this, right?

09:34.420 --> 09:36.880
That's that's right there. What?

09:37.940 --> 09:39.940
7,200 doughnuts in a year

09:39.940 --> 09:45.420
My hurt times the amount of Krispy Kreme locations. That's just lost money

09:46.020 --> 09:48.140
Yeah, it's lost money, but it's also like not

09:48.820 --> 09:50.760
Great, I think

09:50.760 --> 09:55.940
To eat a free Krispy Kreme donut every day. Well, sure think that that's great for your overall well-being

09:56.060 --> 09:58.060
It can be part of a well-balanced

09:58.780 --> 10:02.500
Eating plan, but hey, listen, let's let's sneak on down the FAQ

10:02.500 --> 10:07.180
Come with me go walk past those regular queues and let's get to a LFAQ

10:07.180 --> 10:14.420
Let's get to a LFAQ less frequently. Yes. Come on. This is really the point where I decided to talk about this

10:15.180 --> 10:19.100
Here's the LFAQ this less frequently asked question. What if

10:19.100 --> 10:45.100
What if I don't want to get vaccinated, can I still do this. It's so awesome. Free doughnuts. Yes. Yes. Here for that. Love it, love it, love it.

10:45.100 --> 11:05.660
Is there a scientifically proven vaccine that's completely safe and will prevent me from getting COVID and help me prevent the spread of the disease and protect my loved ones. I'm not crazy about that. I'm not sure about that one, Kris. But I do like doughnuts. I love freebies. I want to participate in the program. Don't get me wrong, Kris. I want the free doughnut. I need the A for that LFAQ. Here's the A

11:06.380 --> 11:11.860
We understand that choosing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine is a highly personal decision

11:11.860 --> 11:24.780
No. We advise all employees and guests to consult with their health care provider regarding whether to obtain a COVID-19 vaccination and which vaccine to receive after reviewing the available information.

11:24.780 --> 11:43.780
If you have made the personal decision to not receive the COVID-19 vaccine, please visit us on Mondays, March 29th through May 24th to receive a free original glazed doughnut and a medium brewed coffee.

11:43.780 --> 11:58.780
Get your week off to a good start. They're having a rumpus. They're having Buckwild Mondays where the promotion is come get your free doughnut and a free coffee. That's a better deal.

11:58.780 --> 12:11.780
We want to pack in all the nasty folks on this one day. All you ribbled motherfuckers that don't want to get the jab. You just all come in and get one swampy morass of free doughnuts and illness.

12:11.780 --> 12:23.780
Here's the thing. Krispy Kreme takes one quarter of a bold stance by saying, I'll give you a doughnut for your vaccine every day. And then they back it way, way up. They take one step forward and eight steps back.

12:23.780 --> 12:35.780
What they should do is say you get a free doughnut every day for a year if you get the vaccination. And if you don't get the vaccination, you owe us one doughnut every day for a year.

12:35.780 --> 12:40.780
And that's how we pay this off. This is how we swap this out. A doughnut for a doughnut.

12:40.780 --> 12:48.780
Yeah, because right now they're calling up President Joey, President Joey Bag of Doughnuts, and saying like, you're fucking killing us, dude. Can you chill?

12:48.780 --> 12:58.780
Like the last dude, he sucked shit. But like, he also wasn't sort of taking us apart at every sort of level by getting all these jabs going.

12:58.780 --> 13:08.780
So anyway, that's the promotion. Krispy Kreme, I love the idea. Do wish you had a little bit of a strengthier convictions there, y'all.

13:08.780 --> 13:17.780
Just a little bit more, because you don't get free coffee if you get the jab. You only get the free coffee if you're a dirty little dog.

13:17.780 --> 13:23.780
Yeah, isn't that strange? Isn't that strange that you get the coffee?

13:23.780 --> 13:26.780
Wait, guys, is it possible the coffee has the vaccine in it?

13:26.780 --> 13:35.780
That's entirely possible. I mean, it could also be possible that they're setting up like a toddler hangout, let's spread this chicken pox all around and just get it done with.

13:35.780 --> 13:38.780
I see. We're forcing the herd immunity here.

13:38.780 --> 13:44.780
And I just hope they are providing the correct sort of protective gear for the employees at Krispy Kreme.

13:44.780 --> 13:48.780
Well, you go and you get your free donut and your free coffee, right? But then when you leave, what's that?

13:48.780 --> 13:53.780
You're being ushered into the back of a big box truck. Oh, what? Where are we going?

13:53.780 --> 13:57.780
Well, this is going to be a farm where all the people who don't care about vaccines can live.

13:57.780 --> 14:00.780
And you won't be able to get everybody else infected, you dirty dogs.

14:00.780 --> 14:02.780
Will there be free donuts?

14:02.780 --> 14:05.780
There will be some kind of food.

14:05.780 --> 14:06.780
Yeah.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.780
You won't have to pay for it.

14:08.780 --> 14:11.780
You're going to be happy here. Don't worry about it.

14:11.780 --> 14:13.780
It's going to be fine.

14:13.780 --> 14:19.780
Let's get into the advice. I'm ready to help some people and I want to start with this one.

14:19.780 --> 14:21.780
An excellent question here.

14:21.780 --> 14:27.780
When I was in second grade, Shaquille O'Neal came to my school to have a Q&A with the kids.

14:27.780 --> 14:31.780
I was chosen to ask him a question. I asked it, then sat down.

14:31.780 --> 14:35.780
The thing is, after some of the other kids asked a question, he would give them a kiss on the cheek.

14:35.780 --> 14:37.780
Is this real?

14:37.780 --> 14:46.780
I feel like if Shaquille O'Neal went to schools a lot and kissed a lot of kids on the cheek, we would have heard about it by now.

14:46.780 --> 14:49.780
Well, keep going because the details lead me to believe this is real.

14:49.780 --> 14:51.780
Yeah, the details stack up.

14:51.780 --> 14:54.780
If I ever meet him again, do I ask for it? No.

14:54.780 --> 14:59.780
Do I relay the story and go at it coy, go for a European greeting and hope he reciprocates,

14:59.780 --> 15:01.780
or just forget the whole thing altogether?

15:01.780 --> 15:02.780
Not that one.

15:02.780 --> 15:04.780
That's from reflecting in the red stick.

15:04.780 --> 15:08.780
P.S. I asked him if he was allergic to strawberries. I had no idea who he was.

15:08.780 --> 15:13.780
I was talking with my mom about my mom's allergies in the car on the way there, and I was just curious.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.780
It was actually a clip for the news. He is not.

15:15.780 --> 15:21.780
Okay, that's good to know. I was worried. Thank you for letting me know that Mr. Shaquille O'Neal is not allergic to strawberries.

15:21.780 --> 15:27.780
I like that you, as a second grader, saw this giant man.

15:27.780 --> 15:30.780
People were excited that he was there, and you thought,

15:30.780 --> 15:35.780
I wonder if this giant man is allergic to strawberries. No further questions.

15:35.780 --> 15:39.780
That was the question. That was your – God almighty.

15:39.780 --> 15:46.780
If you had one chance to ask Shaquille O'Neal a question, for me it would be,

15:46.780 --> 15:49.780
what do you like better, The General or Papa John's?

15:49.780 --> 15:51.780
Which of your business things are you more into?

15:51.780 --> 15:52.780
You have to choose.

15:52.780 --> 15:59.780
I've seen all the commercials. Can you explain to me what The General is and why they made –

15:59.780 --> 16:07.780
they have you as their spokesperson, but they also have a fucking Allie McBeal CGI baby general man as the mascot.

16:07.780 --> 16:10.780
Can you explain – isn't that redundant, Mr. O'Neal?

16:10.780 --> 16:14.780
Do you think that there's a chance, because of the specificity of the question,

16:14.780 --> 16:17.780
that if you did run into Mr. Shaquille O'Neal now and you said,

16:17.780 --> 16:22.780
I was the kid, you came to my second grade class, I asked you about strawberries,

16:22.780 --> 16:26.780
and Shaquille O'Neal would be like, of course I remember you. I owe you one kiss on the cheek.

16:26.780 --> 16:30.780
I was just so befuddled in the moment by the specificity of your question,

16:30.780 --> 16:33.780
I forgot to give you a cheek kiss as is my way.

16:33.780 --> 16:38.780
Yeah. If I saw Shaq and I could ask him a question,

16:38.780 --> 16:41.780
I'd like to think it would be something urbane and erudite,

16:41.780 --> 16:48.780
but I think it would just be kind of like a – I would just be so relieved to get the chance

16:48.780 --> 16:51.780
that it would be something like, where do I go from here, Shaq?

16:51.780 --> 16:52.780
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:52.780 --> 16:57.780
You know what I mean? Like, hey Shaq, where do we go from here?

16:57.780 --> 16:58.780
What's next?

16:58.780 --> 17:01.780
What's next? Hey Shaq, what's next?

17:01.780 --> 17:08.780
See, I think my question, I'd want it to be – I'd want it to be funny, right, and kind of like ironic.

17:08.780 --> 17:10.780
Oh, you'd want to get him in stitches.

17:10.780 --> 17:15.780
Yeah, I'd want it to be like, did you ever fully become Jin? Right? Something like that.

17:15.780 --> 17:18.780
Yeah, that'd be a good one. I bet he'd never heard that one before.

17:18.780 --> 17:26.780
But I think in all honesty, if I now, even as a 37-year-old adult, ran into Mr. Shaquille O'Neal,

17:26.780 --> 17:29.780
I think – and someone like whispered in my ear like, you got one chance, one question.

17:29.780 --> 17:32.780
I think it would just be like, how's it going? Like, I think that's the best thing.

17:32.780 --> 17:34.780
You wouldn't do that. No, you would have some of the best –

17:34.780 --> 17:37.780
Travis, I've got a microphone. I'm putting it in your face right now.

17:37.780 --> 17:40.780
Ask a question of Shaquille O'Neal. Don't think about it. Just ask.

17:40.780 --> 17:44.780
Travis? You're thinking.

17:44.780 --> 17:47.780
You're right. Okay. Hey, can you give that to me again, please?

17:47.780 --> 17:51.780
Yeah. Travis, here's a microphone. I've got Shaquille O'Neal.

17:51.780 --> 17:54.780
Hi, Travis. You can ask him one question.

17:54.780 --> 17:57.780
What was it like to be beaten by Aaron Carter?

17:57.780 --> 18:03.780
That is a fucking slam dunk. Now, I do appreciate that my metaphor there was good.

18:03.780 --> 18:11.780
I appreciate that that just came to me, but I would love to force Shaq to relive the day that Aaron Carter –

18:11.780 --> 18:17.780
Yeah. Here's the thing. Okay, it is occurring to me now how many wonderful things –

18:17.780 --> 18:23.780
like, how many – there's Shaq Fu. There's how I beat Shaq. There's Kazam.

18:23.780 --> 18:25.780
There's just like this – and I believe he was –

18:25.780 --> 18:29.780
There's the Papa John thing where he renamed them all to Shaka Johns or whatever he called it.

18:29.780 --> 18:31.780
I think he was in Space Jam 1, right?

18:31.780 --> 18:33.780
No. Probably.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.780
He was not. He was in Steel, though, as –

18:36.780 --> 18:37.780
Steel.

18:37.780 --> 18:38.780
From Steel?

18:38.780 --> 18:46.780
It was a storied, like, able-to-be-referenced life Shaquille O'Neal has led, and –

18:46.780 --> 18:49.780
You don't have an ending to that thought, do you? You just want to talk about how great –

18:49.780 --> 18:51.780
No, I just want to talk about how great Shaq is.

18:51.780 --> 18:52.780
Yeah.

18:52.780 --> 18:58.780
I mean, here's the thing. There will be people like our question asker who may have no idea that Shaquille O'Neal ever played basketball.

18:58.780 --> 18:59.780
Interesting.

18:59.780 --> 19:05.780
He is just the guy who was in that Genie movie and played Steel, and he's in those general commercials.

19:05.780 --> 19:09.780
And remember that video game about him where I believe he beat up Godzilla or something?

19:09.780 --> 19:16.780
Like, that there are so many things Shaquille O'Neal – like, he could have just been very good at basketball.

19:16.780 --> 19:22.780
And he said, no, no. I have so much more Shaqs to give. Let me do other, weirder things.

19:22.780 --> 19:31.780
Hey! 2020. Summer 2020. A woman has a blowout. Tire has a blowout. Has to pull over to the side of the road. Who's there to assist?

19:31.780 --> 19:32.780
Is it Shaq?

19:32.780 --> 19:34.780
It's Shaq. Shaq pulls over to help.

19:34.780 --> 19:35.780
More great stuff.

19:35.780 --> 19:38.780
Shaq doesn't give a – if there's any cars, they'll just punch them out of the way.

19:38.780 --> 19:39.780
Right.

19:39.780 --> 19:41.780
Protect everybody.

19:41.780 --> 19:49.780
How about this? And this is – we've completely lost the plot of this question. I hope that's okay, because now we're just kind of having fun with it.

19:49.780 --> 19:56.780
But what if they did a new thing of Deal or No Deal, but then he was the host and it was called Shaquille or No Deal?

19:56.780 --> 19:57.780
Ooh, I like that.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.780
Or Shaquille O'Neal is another option.

20:00.780 --> 20:01.780
Uh-huh.

20:01.780 --> 20:06.780
That was a lot of fun talking – hey, guys, sometimes it's just fun to talk about Shaq for a bit.

20:06.780 --> 20:08.780
Yeah, we do it a lot. Have you noticed that?

20:08.780 --> 20:11.780
Yeah, we sure, we do. Do you want a Yahoo?

20:11.780 --> 20:12.780
Yeah.

20:12.780 --> 20:19.780
This one was sent in by Graham Roebuck – thank you, Graham, crushes – from Yahoo Answers user Emily, who asks,

20:19.780 --> 20:23.780
why did nature mess with dolphins this bad?

20:23.780 --> 20:25.780
Yes, thank you.

20:25.780 --> 20:29.780
They have to live in the water. They can't walk, but they have to go up for air every ten minutes?

20:29.780 --> 20:31.780
How could nature do that to them?

20:31.780 --> 20:32.780
Okay, listen.

20:32.780 --> 20:34.780
That sucks. Can you imagine if you had to leave –

20:34.780 --> 20:37.780
Yeah, I wish I could goof on this, but that's pretty fucked up.

20:37.780 --> 20:43.780
What if you had to leave your house every ten minutes to step outside and breathe and then go back inside your house?

20:43.780 --> 20:44.780
If it was that case –

20:44.780 --> 20:46.780
You basically decide the existence of a smoker.

20:46.780 --> 20:51.780
Well, but it's more like, hey, step outside, stick your head in that fountain, now come back inside.

20:51.780 --> 20:57.780
Oh, that's right. It's not even the same sort of physical substance.

20:57.780 --> 21:00.780
And it's like, hey, can I bring it inside my house? No, no, no, no.

21:00.780 --> 21:01.780
No.

21:01.780 --> 21:03.780
If you bring it in there, it'll immediately go away. It disappears.

21:03.780 --> 21:08.780
It is – how did nature – okay, now see, now I'm thinking about it.

21:08.780 --> 21:14.780
Because if you're dolphins and you're trying to figure it out, and you have to save the other dolphins.

21:14.780 --> 21:19.780
Okay, you guys are going to think I'm crazy, but I do think I cracked it.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.780
We're supposed to be in both.

21:21.780 --> 21:22.780
Yeah.

21:22.780 --> 21:25.780
Like, wait, what? Do you mean the dry or the wet?

21:25.780 --> 21:27.780
No, no, no. This is the wild part.

21:27.780 --> 21:29.780
It's going to say, I don't want to fuck with you. Both.

21:29.780 --> 21:30.780
Yeah.

21:30.780 --> 21:32.780
Like, we have to be in the wet for a while. Nobody else has to do that.

21:32.780 --> 21:33.780
All these fish.

21:33.780 --> 21:34.780
We do.

21:34.780 --> 21:35.780
Whales.

21:35.780 --> 21:36.780
Turtles.

21:36.780 --> 21:38.780
Whales do have to do that.

21:38.780 --> 21:39.780
Nobody else.

21:39.780 --> 21:40.780
I mean, there's probably a lot.

21:40.780 --> 21:42.780
Dolphins don't know about whales.

21:42.780 --> 21:43.780
You're right.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.780
I'm pretty sure dolphins know about whales.

21:45.780 --> 21:46.780
Oh my god, we've definitely –

21:46.780 --> 21:49.780
You see a fucking giant dolphin, you're going to turn around and run.

21:49.780 --> 21:52.780
You're not going to ask him his life story and if he's in the dry and the wet in an equal amount of time. No way.

21:52.780 --> 21:53.780
We have for sure –

21:53.780 --> 21:54.780
Dolphins don't know about whales.

21:54.780 --> 21:58.780
We have for sure had this exact discussion before, which is wild to me.

21:58.780 --> 21:59.780
No, we haven't.

21:59.780 --> 22:02.780
I don't think dolphins would hang out with whales. I don't think whales would hang out with dolphins.

22:02.780 --> 22:03.780
Absolutely not. They'd be afraid.

22:03.780 --> 22:07.780
I think whales would find the dolphins a little much. You know what I mean?

22:07.780 --> 22:11.780
You're a whale. You're moving at your own pace. You're doing things.

22:11.780 --> 22:17.780
I guess just floating forward until you die or make another smaller you because there's not –

22:17.780 --> 22:18.780
There's not a whole lot else to do.

22:18.780 --> 22:19.780
Like, you're not obtaining great works of art or whatever.

22:19.780 --> 22:20.780
Sure.

22:20.780 --> 22:24.780
And then you see a dolphin come over and they're doing like flips and tricks and shit and you're like, oh my god.

22:24.780 --> 22:25.780
Oh man.

22:25.780 --> 22:26.780
Could you not?

22:26.780 --> 22:30.780
I'm going to do that. Whoop, splash. And then they post a video online that's like, look at this big whale.

22:30.780 --> 22:36.780
Do it – jump out and do a huge splash. And that whale sees the video and he's like, I was trying to do a cool flip like my friend dolphin.

22:36.780 --> 22:37.780
Yeah.

22:37.780 --> 22:38.780
Do you think that when dolphins –

22:38.780 --> 22:39.780
I'm still like an asshole.

22:39.780 --> 22:46.780
When dolphins see us in our scubas swimming around and like staying underwater for longer than 10 –

22:46.780 --> 22:51.780
Do you think dolphins ever trail scuba divers like, Jeremy, check this out.

22:51.780 --> 22:57.780
That dude, he's been down here for like 20 fucking minutes and I know he likes air.

22:57.780 --> 23:03.780
Like, I know he loves the air as much as we do. So like, what's going on?

23:03.780 --> 23:12.780
And the other side of that though is like when they see a shark who can stay down the whole time, they're probably like, what the fuck?

23:12.780 --> 23:15.780
Why can't – hey, why can't we do that?

23:15.780 --> 23:16.780
Hey.

23:16.780 --> 23:17.780
Yeah.

23:17.780 --> 23:18.780
It's not fair.

23:18.780 --> 23:19.780
Have we tried just staying down –

23:19.780 --> 23:21.780
I can't.

23:21.780 --> 23:25.780
They got cuts on them that they do it through, so I guess – hey, cut me.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.780
Ow, fuck. That didn't work.

23:27.780 --> 23:29.780
That's not it.

23:29.780 --> 23:32.780
Oh shit, he's got a lot of cuts though. Okay, do it six times real fast.

23:32.780 --> 23:33.780
Ow, fuck.

23:33.780 --> 23:34.780
No, it's just my –

23:34.780 --> 23:35.780
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

23:35.780 --> 23:37.780
Guys, the red is coming out.

23:37.780 --> 23:39.780
It's the inside wet. The inside wet.

23:39.780 --> 23:42.780
The inside wet's coming out. The air's not going in.

23:42.780 --> 23:44.780
Ah, man.

23:44.780 --> 23:45.780
This sucks.

23:45.780 --> 23:50.780
There's a lot of shitty answers on this question, by the way. A lot of shitty answers.

23:50.780 --> 23:51.780
Unsurprising.

23:51.780 --> 23:54.780
So dolphins have to breathe every ten minutes? Why did nature mess with us?

23:54.780 --> 23:57.780
We have to breathe every few seconds. Occasionally we can hold our breath for a few minutes.

23:57.780 --> 23:59.780
Hey, dumb-dumb, hey.

23:59.780 --> 24:00.780
That's not the point.

24:00.780 --> 24:01.780
That's not the fucking point.

24:01.780 --> 24:02.780
You live in the dry.

24:02.780 --> 24:05.780
Listen, someone else says goodbye and thanks for all the fish.

24:05.780 --> 24:10.780
42.

24:10.780 --> 24:13.780
Pretty good though, the one you said.

24:13.780 --> 24:15.780
Does it say goodbye and thanks for all the fish?

24:15.780 --> 24:16.780
Yeah, it's not even the right fucking –

24:16.780 --> 24:18.780
I couldn't even get the line right.

24:18.780 --> 24:25.780
But there is a rad pic of just a slimy gray dolphin he's poking out of the water.

24:25.780 --> 24:28.780
He's got a big smile and it says, they look pretty happy to me.

24:28.780 --> 24:33.780
And I want to tell that person that is just kind of what their mouth looks like.

24:33.780 --> 24:40.780
And for all we know, this dolphin is a circus dolphin and is probably not living his best life.

24:40.780 --> 24:47.780
Okay, but they do look happy.

24:47.780 --> 24:51.780
But again, Justin, I do want to say what I literally just said eight seconds ago.

24:51.780 --> 24:52.780
Yeah, but they look happy.

24:52.780 --> 24:57.780
Is it possible that the balance is something we can learn from that?

24:57.780 --> 24:58.780
But it's not balance, Justin.

24:58.780 --> 24:59.780
Don't spend all your time in one.

24:59.780 --> 25:02.780
Don't spend all your time in the wet or the dry. Find a balance.

25:02.780 --> 25:03.780
But it's not balance, Justin.

25:03.780 --> 25:07.780
They live 99% of the time in the wet.

25:07.780 --> 25:13.780
They're not rolling up on the land walking around for a while and then going back into the wet, Justin.

25:13.780 --> 25:17.780
They're in the wet and they have to basically stick their backs up.

25:17.780 --> 25:24.780
If every 10 minutes you had to push the back of your head through your wall to live, that fucking sucks.

25:24.780 --> 25:28.780
It's not balanced.

25:28.780 --> 25:32.780
And yet you're over here telling me evolution is real, Justin.

25:32.780 --> 25:37.780
But if evolution is so real, then how come dolphins haven't evolved to breathe water?

25:37.780 --> 25:40.780
Well, because then we wouldn't be able to see them as much.

25:40.780 --> 25:41.780
Oh, that's a good point.

25:41.780 --> 25:42.780
No, they evolved for us.

25:42.780 --> 25:43.780
That's something for us.

25:43.780 --> 25:44.780
They evolved for us.

25:44.780 --> 25:45.780
They miss us, too.

25:45.780 --> 25:46.780
Yeah, they love us.

25:46.780 --> 25:47.780
That's our thing.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.780
They evolved blowholes to come up and see us, to have an excuse.

25:50.780 --> 25:54.780
So what you're saying, Justin, is there was a time when dolphins lived on land and they hung out with human beings.

25:54.780 --> 25:58.780
And they said, we want to spend a lot of time in the wet, but we don't want to miss you entirely.

25:58.780 --> 26:00.780
And that's how they evolved?

26:00.780 --> 26:01.780
Maybe.

26:01.780 --> 26:05.780
The order of occurrences is something of a mystery.

26:05.780 --> 26:08.780
So it might have been that they were underwater the whole time and they said, what's up there?

26:08.780 --> 26:10.780
I want to be part of that world.

26:10.780 --> 26:14.780
And they made a deal with Ursula, and Ursula gave them blowholes so they could come up and say hi.

26:14.780 --> 26:15.780
But she took their voice.

26:15.780 --> 26:17.780
God, I'm so sick of her.

26:17.780 --> 26:18.780
I know, right?

26:18.780 --> 26:20.780
Ruins it for everybody.

26:20.780 --> 26:24.780
We have fun, but she took that lady's voice away.

26:24.780 --> 26:26.780
She took her fucking voice away.

26:26.780 --> 26:28.780
So she could go see a man she never met.

26:28.780 --> 26:30.780
Ursula knew what the fuck was up.

26:30.780 --> 26:32.780
Ursula knew she wasn't coming back.

26:32.780 --> 26:37.780
A lot of people like to treat Ursula like the hero of the story, but I'm sorry.

26:37.780 --> 26:40.780
I think she's the villain.

26:40.780 --> 26:41.780
Yeah.

26:41.780 --> 26:43.780
Well, she does get killed by a big boat.

26:43.780 --> 26:44.780
That is true.

26:44.780 --> 26:45.780
For her crimes.

26:45.780 --> 26:46.780
It's a fair point.

26:46.780 --> 26:49.780
You guys ever think about what a shitty dad Triton was?

26:49.780 --> 26:50.780
He was not great.

26:50.780 --> 26:52.780
I don't want to talk about that.

26:52.780 --> 26:53.780
Should we go to the Money Town?

26:53.780 --> 26:54.780
Yeah.

26:54.780 --> 26:55.780
Great.

26:55.780 --> 27:10.780
Let's go.

27:10.780 --> 27:12.780
Hey, you want to fill your belly?

27:12.780 --> 27:14.780
Why not fill it with a basket of sun?

27:14.780 --> 27:15.780
Oh, okay.

27:15.780 --> 27:18.780
I was going to say it depends on what is going in there.

27:18.780 --> 27:19.780
No, it's sun.

27:19.780 --> 27:20.780
Pure sunshine.

27:20.780 --> 27:27.780
We've partnered with the best scientist at Sun Basket to bring you a basket full of pure photons.

27:27.780 --> 27:28.780
They're going to fill your belly up.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.780
You're going to eat sunlight.

27:30.780 --> 27:31.780
It's not true.

27:31.780 --> 27:32.780
It's so stupid.

27:32.780 --> 27:33.780
It's not true.

27:33.780 --> 27:34.780
It's sunlight.

27:34.780 --> 27:35.780
No, it's not, Travis.

27:35.780 --> 27:39.780
It's delicious food that's sent to you, and then you make it, and it makes you happy.

27:39.780 --> 27:43.780
Last night, I had – I didn't – here's – you want to know something wild about Sun Basket?

27:43.780 --> 27:44.780
What?

27:44.780 --> 27:45.780
Here's what they sent me.

27:45.780 --> 27:49.780
Chicken romesco sauce with green beans and tomatoes.

27:49.780 --> 27:51.780
I didn't – I want to be honest with you.

27:51.780 --> 27:53.780
I'm going to say it right here.

27:53.780 --> 27:55.780
Didn't think I'd like it.

27:55.780 --> 27:57.780
But then I made it, and you know what happened?

27:57.780 --> 27:58.780
Your belly filled with sunlight.

27:58.780 --> 27:59.780
You liked it.

27:59.780 --> 28:02.780
It was absolutely delicious, just like every other meal that Sun Basket sends to me.

28:02.780 --> 28:07.780
They challenged me to think outside of the box a little bit by thinking inside the box.

28:07.780 --> 28:12.780
Whenever every week I get a new box of Sun Basket ingredients, they sent a promo box,

28:12.780 --> 28:15.780
and you know what I did after I ate that promo box?

28:15.780 --> 28:16.780
What?

28:16.780 --> 28:17.780
I just kept getting it.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.780
I was paying for it out of pocket with my own money.

28:20.780 --> 28:22.780
That's how wild I am about Sun Basket.

28:22.780 --> 28:28.780
Delicious foods, really in-depth recipes.

28:28.780 --> 28:30.780
You know what I love also about them is you can switch out the proteins.

28:30.780 --> 28:31.780
Get out.

28:31.780 --> 28:35.780
So if, like, if you want ground chicken and you don't like – I think chicken thighs are gross.

28:35.780 --> 28:36.780
Don't at me.

28:36.780 --> 28:37.780
What?

28:37.780 --> 28:39.780
I switched – I said don't at me.

28:39.780 --> 28:40.780
That wasn't an ad, Justin.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.780
I'm talking to you in real life.

28:42.780 --> 28:45.780
Yeah, it's like a – it's like a – it's like a spoken ad.

28:45.780 --> 28:49.780
You want ground turkey, ground chicken, whatever you want.

28:49.780 --> 28:51.780
They'll sub in the proteins for you.

28:51.780 --> 28:54.780
You can even do, like, tofu or something like that if you want to go meatless.

28:54.780 --> 28:55.780
They got the options.

28:55.780 --> 28:59.780
Beyond the Meal kits, they got these fresh and ready meals, which I know, Griffin, you get into.

28:59.780 --> 29:06.780
Yeah, we're stocking up on those for some quick and easy and tasty dinners for once the baby gets here.

29:06.780 --> 29:07.780
Yeah.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.780
And right now, Sun Basket has a limited time offer.

29:09.780 --> 29:17.780

29:21.780 --> 29:26.780

29:26.780 --> 29:29.780
Offer expires on April 13th.

29:29.780 --> 29:36.780
So I've been doing some streaming recently, and I have noticed conclusively that if someone says, like, great shirt or asks about my shirt,

29:36.780 --> 29:40.780
it is 100% a Stitch Fix shirt that I got from Stitch Fix.

29:40.780 --> 29:47.780
Because ever since I joined Stitch Fix and became, you know, like, a Stitch Fix user, I guess I would say, my style game has improved exponentially.

29:47.780 --> 29:49.780
I think all of ours has.

29:49.780 --> 29:54.780
And I'm also wearing the most comfortable jeans I've ever had.

29:54.780 --> 29:56.780
Jeans you could sleep in.

29:56.780 --> 29:58.780
That's their new slogan.

29:58.780 --> 30:00.780
Stitch Fix jeans you could sleep in.

30:00.780 --> 30:05.780
They offer clothing hand selected by expert stylists for your unique style, size, and budget.

30:05.780 --> 30:09.780
You can try on pieces at home before you buy, keep your favorites, and send back the rest.

30:09.780 --> 30:14.780
Stitch Fix has free shipping, easy returns and exchanges, and a prepaid return envelope is included.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.780
There's no subscription required.

30:16.780 --> 30:19.780
Try Stitch Fix once or set up automatic deliveries.

30:19.780 --> 30:24.780
You'll pay just $20 for a styling fee for each box, which gets credited towards the pieces you keep.

30:24.780 --> 30:26.780
And there's no hidden fees ever.

30:26.780 --> 30:32.780
Get started today at stitchfix.com slash my brother, and you'll get 25% off when you keep everything in your fix.

30:32.780 --> 30:37.780
That's stitchfix.com slash my brother for 25% off when you keep everything in your fix.

30:37.780 --> 30:39.780
Stitchfix.com slash my brother.

30:39.780 --> 30:42.780
Jeans so comfortable you can sleep in them.

30:42.780 --> 30:45.780
I mean, they have shirts so comfortable you can sleep in them too, probably.

30:45.780 --> 30:47.780
Yeah, but that's not impressed.

30:47.780 --> 30:49.780
There are lots of shirts that I would sleep in, and most of them.

30:49.780 --> 30:53.780
You can sleep in anything if you really believe in yourself and you're willing to put yourself to the test.

30:53.780 --> 30:54.780
I mean, yes.

30:54.780 --> 30:57.780
Okay, you could sleep in anything, but these are jeans you want to sleep in.

30:57.780 --> 30:58.780
Is that better?

30:58.780 --> 31:00.780
One time Chris Angel slept in a sweater.

31:00.780 --> 31:01.780
Oh, boy.

31:01.780 --> 31:03.780
It's fucking wild, man.

31:03.780 --> 31:05.780
And it was hot outside too.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.780
It wasn't like a cold night.

31:10.780 --> 31:11.780
Hey, it's Jon Moe.

31:11.780 --> 31:15.780
And look, these are challenging times for our mental and emotional health.

31:15.780 --> 31:16.780
I get it.

31:16.780 --> 31:20.780
That's why I'm so excited for my new podcast, Depression Mode.

31:20.780 --> 31:28.780
We're tackling depression, anxiety, trauma, stress, the kinds of things that are just super common but don't get talked about nearly enough.

31:28.780 --> 31:36.780
Conversations that are illuminating, honest, and sometimes pretty funny with folks like Kelsey Darrah, Dope and Mike Eagle, and Patton Oswalt.

31:36.780 --> 31:38.780
Humphrey Bogart was never in therapy.

31:38.780 --> 31:43.780
And then my dad said, yeah, but he smoked a carton of cigarettes a day.

31:43.780 --> 31:45.780
So he was in therapy.

31:45.780 --> 31:48.780
Plus psychiatrists, psychologists, and all kinds of folks.

31:48.780 --> 31:52.780
On Depression Mode, we're working together, learning, helping each other out.

31:52.780 --> 31:53.780
We're a team.

31:53.780 --> 31:54.780
Join our team.

31:54.780 --> 31:58.780
Depression Mode for maximum fun wherever you get your podcasts.

32:02.780 --> 32:04.780
This is usually where the Munch Squad goes.

32:04.780 --> 32:06.780
Now we're all kind of floundering a bit.

32:06.780 --> 32:09.780
Do you want to read another question?

32:09.780 --> 32:11.780
Yeah, I'd like that.

32:11.780 --> 32:23.780
When I was 13, a lawnmower I was using caught fire and started a small, they've got this in quotes, wildfire, burning a little under an acre of land.

32:23.780 --> 32:27.780
Much to my embarrassment, this was then put on the news.

32:27.780 --> 32:31.780
And since it was a small town, everyone from my school knew it was me.

32:31.780 --> 32:32.780
I'm 23 now.

32:32.780 --> 32:38.780
But sometimes when I go back home, people still sometimes joke like, hey, started any fires lately?

32:38.780 --> 32:39.780
That's a pretty good line.

32:39.780 --> 32:40.780
Good line.

32:40.780 --> 32:45.780
What can I do to take the heat off my history with fire and maybe get known for something new?

32:45.780 --> 32:46.780
Any ideas are appreciated.

32:46.780 --> 32:48.780
That's from accidental arsonist.

32:48.780 --> 32:51.780
And they've got accidental in quotes too, which is strange.

32:51.780 --> 32:52.780
I don't understand.

32:52.780 --> 32:55.780
You're going to need to stop some fires, I think.

32:55.780 --> 32:56.780
Oh, that's good.

32:56.780 --> 32:57.780
Yeah?

32:57.780 --> 33:02.780
I feel like, well, I don't know how many fires you'd have to stop for it to balance out.

33:02.780 --> 33:04.780
Maybe five stopped fires?

33:04.780 --> 33:06.780
One acres worth of fire.

33:06.780 --> 33:07.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:07.780 --> 33:11.780
Depending on if you're in the city, that could be a whole bunch of fires.

33:11.780 --> 33:14.780
But we're not talking about firefighting.

33:14.780 --> 33:17.780
There will be no hoses, no extinguishers involved.

33:17.780 --> 33:23.780
I'm talking about like you see somebody smoking next to a cotton swab factory and you say, stop it.

33:23.780 --> 33:24.780
Stop it.

33:24.780 --> 33:25.780
Hey, no, no, no.

33:25.780 --> 33:26.780
Don't do that.

33:26.780 --> 33:30.780
Don't you see this pile of sawdust you are sitting on top of?

33:30.780 --> 33:32.780
This is a terrible place to set off fireworks.

33:32.780 --> 33:34.780
It's a bad place to have big smokes.

33:34.780 --> 33:35.780
That's a cigar.

33:35.780 --> 33:39.780
That's a big novelty size cigar like a wolf would smoke in a cartoon.

33:39.780 --> 33:41.780
You got such a big cigar.

33:41.780 --> 33:42.780
What?

33:42.780 --> 33:43.780
You're a baby.

33:43.780 --> 33:44.780
You're a baby.

33:44.780 --> 33:45.780
What are you doing with that cigar?

33:45.780 --> 33:48.780
How did you get into this sawdust pile, baby?

33:48.780 --> 33:51.780
Hey, hey, is this Tim here from the news?

33:51.780 --> 33:55.780
Listen, you better get out of here because I'm about to stop a baby from smoking a huge cigar.

33:55.780 --> 33:57.780
And I feel like that's really going to turn my rep around.

33:57.780 --> 34:03.780
And listen, this is going to sound like I staged it, but I promise I came upon this completely naturally.

34:03.780 --> 34:08.780
I did not give this baby a cigar, nor did I set it on top of this pile of sawdust.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.780
Fuck, there's a whole baby cigar party happening.

34:11.780 --> 34:13.780
There's like four more babies with cigars.

34:13.780 --> 34:14.780
Tim, get down here, man.

34:14.780 --> 34:16.780
You got to hurry.

34:16.780 --> 34:17.780
Get down here.

34:17.780 --> 34:18.780
Bring Rob Johnson.

34:18.780 --> 34:19.780
Bring the camera crew.

34:19.780 --> 34:20.780
Call Spencer Atkins.

34:20.780 --> 34:21.780
Get everybody down here.

34:21.780 --> 34:22.780
This is wild.

34:22.780 --> 34:23.780
Get Bill Murray.

34:23.780 --> 34:25.780
Get the whole team out here.

34:25.780 --> 34:26.780
No, not that Bill Murray.

34:26.780 --> 34:29.780
The Bill Murray that was a newscaster in the hometown where we grew up.

34:29.780 --> 34:31.780
The Bill Murray from WSAC.

34:31.780 --> 34:32.780
God.

34:32.780 --> 34:33.780
Come on.

34:33.780 --> 34:34.780
Oh, you're not coming?

34:34.780 --> 34:35.780
Okay.

34:35.780 --> 34:39.780
See, now you've got to start your own television news station or newspaper.

34:39.780 --> 34:46.780
Okay, this is Bob Stevenson with the Bob Stevenson Dispatch, and oh boy, I've done it again.

34:46.780 --> 34:50.780
Stopped another baby cigar fire at the sawdust factory.

34:50.780 --> 34:52.780
This paper is free.

34:52.780 --> 34:55.780
Please just read it and give it to everyone you know.

34:55.780 --> 34:57.780
Well, I mean, you could start a YouTube channel.

34:57.780 --> 34:58.780
Those are easy.

34:58.780 --> 35:02.780
Everybody's got a YouTube channel now, right, where you're just going around stopping baby fires.

35:02.780 --> 35:04.780
Thanks for subscribing to my newsletter.

35:04.780 --> 35:08.780
Didn't stop any fires this week, but watch this space.

35:08.780 --> 35:10.780
I'm out there.

35:10.780 --> 35:15.780
Email me at my tip line if you see anybody doing bad fire stuff.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.780
No difficult fires, though, please.

35:17.780 --> 35:20.780
I don't have any resources.

35:20.780 --> 35:26.780
Do you have a sort of, is this the sort of town where just having your own YouTube would make you like the YouTube guy?

35:26.780 --> 35:27.780
Oh, I don't mind that.

35:27.780 --> 35:28.780
Rather than the fire guy?

35:28.780 --> 35:29.780
Yeah.

35:29.780 --> 35:30.780
He's the one with the YouTube.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.780
Started any YouTube channels lately?

35:32.780 --> 35:33.780
I did, actually.

35:33.780 --> 35:34.780
Three more.

35:34.780 --> 35:35.780
Yeah.

35:35.780 --> 35:37.780
Where's my mukbang channel?

35:37.780 --> 35:40.780
Okay.

35:40.780 --> 35:44.780
If they didn't want people to be repulsed by mukbang, they should have called it something less repulsive.

35:44.780 --> 35:45.780
Period.

35:45.780 --> 35:46.780
Mouth sounds?

35:46.780 --> 35:47.780
End of sentence.

35:47.780 --> 35:48.780
Mouth sounds bad.

35:48.780 --> 35:49.780
Okay.

35:49.780 --> 35:52.780
The sound your mouth makes when you say mouth sounds is actually pretty bad.

35:52.780 --> 35:53.780
It's really rough.

35:53.780 --> 35:57.780
I mean, we had to go become big podcasters so we could just stop being Clint's kids.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.780
Oh, here come Clint's kids up to no good.

35:59.780 --> 36:01.780
Apple doesn't fall far from the tree, huh?

36:01.780 --> 36:03.780
Like, I'm my own guy, actually.

36:03.780 --> 36:06.780
Like, I do a bunch of stuff that has nothing to do with my dad.

36:06.780 --> 36:10.780
Yeah, I worked pretty hard to become the non-video game brother.

36:10.780 --> 36:12.780
But now I'm blowing it with this Twitch thing.

36:12.780 --> 36:14.780
Oh no, I just realized.

36:14.780 --> 36:17.780
Oh no, I'm going to become the video game brother.

36:17.780 --> 36:18.780
No, you're still the beard brother.

36:18.780 --> 36:19.780
Oh, thank you.

36:19.780 --> 36:20.780
That means a lot to me.

36:20.780 --> 36:21.780
You can hear the beard on the microphone.

36:21.780 --> 36:22.780
Thank you so much.

36:22.780 --> 36:23.780
It's scratchy and rough.

36:23.780 --> 36:24.780
Thank you.

36:24.780 --> 36:28.780
You could start other bigger fires and then maybe people would still learn to watch their fucking mouths.

36:28.780 --> 36:29.780
Or own it.

36:29.780 --> 36:30.780
And someone's like, did you start any fires lately?

36:30.780 --> 36:32.780
And they're like, I did.

36:32.780 --> 36:33.780
I did.

36:33.780 --> 36:34.780
It's your house.

36:34.780 --> 36:35.780
Go home.

36:35.780 --> 36:37.780
You better go check on your dad.

36:37.780 --> 36:39.780
Go check on your dad.

36:39.780 --> 36:40.780
Ah, yes.

36:40.780 --> 36:42.780
That's Fireboy's catchphrase, don't you know?

36:42.780 --> 36:44.780
Go check on your dad.

36:44.780 --> 36:49.780
Is it possible to say it was a controlled burn?

36:49.780 --> 36:52.780
And that they don't get it.

36:52.780 --> 36:54.780
I'm an amateur fire person.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.780
This is a controlled burn.

36:56.780 --> 36:59.780
I had it completely under control.

36:59.780 --> 37:02.780
Don't you see how I put quotes around wildfire?

37:02.780 --> 37:04.780
More like mild fire.

37:04.780 --> 37:08.780
That's just a little joke in the controlled fire industry.

37:08.780 --> 37:14.780
Now you're asking, is a broken lawnmower the typical device we use to start our controlled burns?

37:14.780 --> 37:17.780
And that just shows how ignorant you are.

37:17.780 --> 37:21.780
Have you read any books about starting controlled burns lately?

37:21.780 --> 37:22.780
What do you think?

37:22.780 --> 37:26.780
People just throw their broken lawnmowers in the garbage when they're done with them?

37:26.780 --> 37:27.780
No.

37:27.780 --> 37:28.780
What a waste.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.780
What a tremendous waste.

37:31.780 --> 37:37.780
Were there several small businesses located in this one acre that also burned down?

37:37.780 --> 37:40.780
Yeah, that's part of the control, dude.

37:40.780 --> 37:43.780
I had to burn them down to make room for new businesses.

37:43.780 --> 37:45.780
Those have sprinklers.

37:45.780 --> 37:47.780
It's easier to control it.

37:47.780 --> 37:50.780
Think about if it was just trees, you idiot.

37:50.780 --> 37:52.780
Those burn so quick.

37:52.780 --> 37:54.780
They had to get some insurance money.

37:54.780 --> 37:56.780
It's all part of the plan.

37:56.780 --> 37:58.780
It's all part of the plan.

37:58.780 --> 37:59.780
They were in on it.

37:59.780 --> 38:00.780
We were all in on it.

38:00.780 --> 38:07.780
And aren't you enjoying that new Mexican restaurant that they built on the burned up ground that I burned up?

38:07.780 --> 38:08.780
You're welcome.

38:08.780 --> 38:10.780
Enjoy your enchiladas.

38:10.780 --> 38:11.780
What about the-

38:11.780 --> 38:12.780
It's a natural part.

38:12.780 --> 38:15.780
What about the part of the wildlife preserve that burned down too?

38:15.780 --> 38:16.780
You're welcome.

38:16.780 --> 38:21.780
That one was an accident, but everybody's allowed to make a few accidents, huh?

38:21.780 --> 38:23.780
Yeah, I'm human.

38:23.780 --> 38:24.780
I'm a human being.

38:24.780 --> 38:25.780
I'm a human being.

38:25.780 --> 38:28.780
And those were very rare birds.

38:28.780 --> 38:35.780
Now they're more rare, and the people who have those birds have more money in their pockets, so they're not complaining, huh?

38:35.780 --> 38:38.780
Hey, what about the kinds of animals that eat ashes?

38:38.780 --> 38:39.780
Yep.

38:39.780 --> 38:43.780
They gotta get their bellies full too, right?

38:43.780 --> 38:44.780
Yes.

38:44.780 --> 38:47.780
And to be fair, I thought those birds were phoenixes.

38:47.780 --> 38:51.780
And if that had been the case, this all would have been totally cool, wouldn't it?

38:51.780 --> 38:54.780
So I guess you're the jerk now, Steven.

38:54.780 --> 38:56.780
What if you lost your keys?

38:56.780 --> 38:58.780
They're easier to find now.

38:58.780 --> 38:59.780
Yes.

38:59.780 --> 39:04.780
And I know that your car was also parked in there, and so that is kind of a moot point, and I understand that.

39:04.780 --> 39:05.780
I am sorry.

39:05.780 --> 39:07.780
But that's part of the control.

39:07.780 --> 39:08.780
Griffin, do you have any-

39:08.780 --> 39:09.780
I do, I do.

39:09.780 --> 39:12.780
This one was also sent in by Graham Roebuck, thank you.

39:12.780 --> 39:15.780
It's Yahoo Answers user Sorry, who asks,

39:15.780 --> 39:18.780
How can a font be sexy?

39:18.780 --> 39:24.780
On multiple font websites, I have seen sexy as a category, but they aren't just letters?

39:24.780 --> 39:25.780
What is happening?

39:25.780 --> 39:26.780
Oh, come on.

39:26.780 --> 39:27.780
Stop being willfully obtuse.

39:27.780 --> 39:28.780
You know the answer to this.

39:28.780 --> 39:34.780
If you saw, let's see, if you got a love letter in papyrus, right?

39:34.780 --> 39:37.780
You would be like, oh, okay, whatever, right?

39:37.780 --> 39:41.780
Did this love letter get sent through time from ancient Egypt or some shit?

39:41.780 --> 39:42.780
Right, right, right.

39:42.780 --> 39:47.780
And I'm just pulling this off the top of my head, and I'm not looking, but sans serif sounds sexy?

39:47.780 --> 39:49.780
Yeah, sans serif is probably, it's up there.

39:49.780 --> 39:56.780
I think that that was the one that they sort of, they had sexiness in mind when they were developing this font.

39:56.780 --> 39:57.780
That's not very good.

39:57.780 --> 40:01.780
I'm just going to type in sexy font and then look away.

40:01.780 --> 40:03.780
Travis, type sexy font and then just go for it.

40:03.780 --> 40:04.780
Okay, I'm going to type sexy font.

40:04.780 --> 40:07.780
Helvetica.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.780
Helvetica sound, I would love to kiss Helvetica.

40:09.780 --> 40:11.780
Cassandra.

40:11.780 --> 40:12.780
Hello, Cassandra.

40:12.780 --> 40:14.780
That's kind of sexy, yeah.

40:14.780 --> 40:32.780
I love in all of these promotions where they're showing what the font looks like, even in the sexy font, it's like, the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

40:32.780 --> 40:33.780
Oh, that would be a sexy font.

40:33.780 --> 40:39.780
If anyone's looking to design a sexy font, make it so anytime you put a single X, it's immediately three Xs.

40:39.780 --> 40:41.780
That's really good.

40:41.780 --> 40:43.780
You can only type three Xs at a time.

40:43.780 --> 40:46.780
Yeah, and while we're at it, just every M becomes three Ms.

40:46.780 --> 40:47.780
Yeah.

40:47.780 --> 40:49.780
That's something.

40:49.780 --> 40:53.780
The quick brown fox jump.

40:53.780 --> 40:56.780
And then there's a period.

40:56.780 --> 40:57.780
The sentence ends.

40:57.780 --> 41:06.780
That's a cool font when it actually changes the syntax of the sentence itself.

41:06.780 --> 41:11.780
So on this typography website, they got reviews for the different fonts.

41:11.780 --> 41:15.780
And they have this to say about Archer.

41:15.780 --> 41:19.780
Sweet but not saccharine, earnest but not grave.

41:19.780 --> 41:25.780
Archer is designed to hit just the right notes of forthrightness, credibility, and charm.

41:25.780 --> 41:27.780
Ooh, I like that.

41:27.780 --> 41:28.780
It's nice, right?

41:28.780 --> 41:29.780
It makes you feel like, hmm, maybe.

41:29.780 --> 41:35.780
Now I have here, I found one that's just called Luxurious Sexy, which, yeah.

41:35.780 --> 41:37.780
I bet you could find a font called E.

41:37.780 --> 41:40.780
I bet you could find a font called like...

41:40.780 --> 41:41.780
I'm going to look for Star Wars.

41:41.780 --> 41:44.780
Well, yeah, sure.

41:44.780 --> 41:47.780
That's not what I was going to say, but all right.

41:47.780 --> 41:50.780
Yeah, if you like Star Wars, I bet there's even a Star Trek one, too.

41:50.780 --> 41:51.780
Either one.

41:51.780 --> 41:52.780
Remember which one you like.

41:52.780 --> 41:53.780
I like Travis.

41:53.780 --> 41:54.780
I bet there's a font for you.

41:54.780 --> 41:55.780
I like the Travis font.

41:55.780 --> 41:58.780
There's a Travis font.

41:58.780 --> 42:04.780
Guys, what could be better fodder for a comedy audio podcast?

42:04.780 --> 42:06.780
Talking about what letters look like?

42:06.780 --> 42:07.780
Yeah, it's probably...

42:07.780 --> 42:08.780
Yeah, talking about letters.

42:08.780 --> 42:09.780
It's good.

42:09.780 --> 42:16.780
I hope the quarantine goes on forever.

42:16.780 --> 42:22.780
Just me talking here, but I love having all my meals come to me in metal boxes.

42:22.780 --> 42:27.780
Hooray.

42:27.780 --> 42:28.780
Okay.

42:28.780 --> 42:33.780
Lynn texted me to tell me there's going to be a Peeps Pepsi mashup.

42:33.780 --> 42:36.780
Peeps and Pepsi are joining forces to create marshmallow soda.

42:36.780 --> 42:37.780
That's gross.

42:37.780 --> 42:38.780
Okay.

42:38.780 --> 42:39.780
It's gross, right?

42:39.780 --> 42:41.780
I'd rather have Cola Peeps, please.

42:41.780 --> 42:42.780
It's marshmallow cola.

42:42.780 --> 42:46.780
It comes in a three pack of little seven and a half ounce cans.

42:46.780 --> 42:57.780
Now, you can't buy them at the fucking store, but you can tweet the hashtag hanginwithmypeeps

42:57.780 --> 43:00.780
and you can enter to win the sweepstakes.

43:00.780 --> 43:06.780
And you're supposed to show yourself enjoying your favorite springtime activities, quote,

43:06.780 --> 43:09.780
in a safe, socially distant manner.

43:09.780 --> 43:12.780
Incentivizing in the Krispy Kreme way.

43:12.780 --> 43:14.780
Safe, COVID-safe behaviors.

43:14.780 --> 43:15.780
Right, safety.

43:15.780 --> 43:17.780
Now, let's get a little deeper here.

43:17.780 --> 43:24.780
Todd Kaplan, the Pepsi's veep of marketing says, after what has been a very difficult year,

43:24.780 --> 43:28.780
many consumers are looking for new things to smile about.

43:28.780 --> 43:30.780
So we made very sweet pepsi.

43:30.780 --> 43:31.780
Can I...

43:31.780 --> 43:32.780
Just for them.

43:32.780 --> 43:36.780
So just because I want to just put a pin in it real quick,

43:36.780 --> 43:43.780
I just want to point out that I think in the QSR and food update kind of Munch Squad world,

43:43.780 --> 43:46.780
the new thing isn't going to be, this has been a difficult year.

43:46.780 --> 43:49.780
It's going to be after a difficult year.

43:49.780 --> 43:53.780
And it will be all about like, now that we've turned the corner, after a difficult year,

43:53.780 --> 43:58.780
things just need to, it's going to be that over and over and over again in some form.

43:58.780 --> 44:00.780
Yeah.

44:00.780 --> 44:02.780
I'm not very good at business, ask anybody.

44:02.780 --> 44:08.780
But how come these like businesses keep announcing these things and then saying,

44:08.780 --> 44:11.780
but you can't buy them, you have to like win them.

44:11.780 --> 44:16.780
Because it's just to get you, it's the new, and I guess Munch Squad is part of it.

44:16.780 --> 44:18.780
You know, like Munch Squad is to blame.

44:18.780 --> 44:21.780
But it's like, you don't actually have to do the thing.

44:21.780 --> 44:25.780
If you just say you're going to do the thing and then make people tweet about it,

44:25.780 --> 44:30.780
then you get all the attention without actually having to like make a bajillion of them

44:30.780 --> 44:32.780
and get logistics going and shit like that.

44:32.780 --> 44:33.780
It's infuriating.

44:33.780 --> 44:36.780
Don't tell me that you're going to make ketchup that looks like some dude's arm

44:36.780 --> 44:39.780
and then it's like, you have to send it in a self-addressed stamped envelope

44:39.780 --> 44:41.780
with fucking Bitcoins inside of it.

44:41.780 --> 44:43.780
Like sell that shit in stores.

44:43.780 --> 44:44.780
Fucking stop it.

44:44.780 --> 44:46.780
Stop making me jump through hoops.

44:46.780 --> 44:50.780
Be brave and trash your brand by making this gross soda

44:50.780 --> 44:53.780
and make some poor person accidentally buy it

44:53.780 --> 44:57.780
and then come home and be like, this soda fucking sucks.

44:57.780 --> 45:02.780
Have somebody accidentally buy your shitty marshmallow soda, cowards.

45:02.780 --> 45:05.780
We let Ed Sheeran make ketchup for us.

45:05.780 --> 45:06.780
Then fucking do it.

45:06.780 --> 45:11.780
Give him tomatoes and spices and sugar and let Ed Sheeran make the ketchup.

45:11.780 --> 45:14.780
And you have to mass produce whatever he makes.

45:14.780 --> 45:15.780
Yes, a million of them.

45:15.780 --> 45:20.780
Send him a million tomatoes and say, ball's in your court, Ed.

45:20.780 --> 45:22.780
Oh man, did you try some of this new ketchup?

45:22.780 --> 45:24.780
It tastes like shitty tomato water.

45:24.780 --> 45:27.780
Yeah, that's because Ed Sheeran squished it with his own feet

45:27.780 --> 45:30.780
and then we had to sell it at Kroger's.

45:30.780 --> 45:33.780
Because that was the deal we made with Ed Sheeran.

45:37.780 --> 45:41.780
Will you make Ed Sheeran ketchup if you promise to sell it for 100 years?

45:41.780 --> 45:43.780
Ooh, okay.

45:43.780 --> 45:46.780
I want it to replace real ketchup.

45:46.780 --> 45:48.780
Ooh, Ed Sheeran, you drive a hard bargain.

45:48.780 --> 45:49.780
Okay, yep, okay.

45:49.780 --> 45:51.780
This will be Heinz 58.

45:51.780 --> 45:53.780
We're throwing out the last one.

45:53.780 --> 45:54.780
This is the new one.

45:54.780 --> 45:57.780
We're not even going to name you on the bottle.

45:57.780 --> 46:00.780
We're just going to call this new ketchup

46:00.780 --> 46:02.780
and you just happen to be the person who made it.

46:02.780 --> 46:03.780
Sounds good to me.

46:03.780 --> 46:04.780
I'm Ed Sheeran.

46:04.780 --> 46:08.780
I dipped my french fries in Ed Sheeran's ketchup juice and it was disgusting.

46:08.780 --> 46:13.780
Well, that's because we're just going to have to find a new way to enjoy ketchup now.

46:13.780 --> 46:15.780
Because ketchup means something else.

46:15.780 --> 46:17.780
Pepsi means something else now.

46:17.780 --> 46:21.780
It's not a refreshing brown beverage that you enjoy with a pizza.

46:21.780 --> 46:25.780
Now it's a different thing that you have to use a different way.

46:25.780 --> 46:27.780
Now it's a joke that we all have to live with.

46:27.780 --> 46:31.780
We actually fucked up so bad because of the new law that Biden put in

46:31.780 --> 46:34.780
where you have to really do the things you say you're going to.

46:34.780 --> 46:35.780
There's no Pepsi anymore.

46:35.780 --> 46:37.780
It's just an Instagram filter.

46:37.780 --> 46:38.780
You can't drink it.

46:38.780 --> 46:39.780
It's a filter on Instagram.

46:39.780 --> 46:40.780
And we fucked up.

46:40.780 --> 46:41.780
Don't get it twisted.

46:41.780 --> 46:42.780
We fucked up.

46:42.780 --> 46:45.780
It was a bad idea that we did but we said we'd do it

46:45.780 --> 46:47.780
and this is it.

46:47.780 --> 46:49.780
Anyways, are you hiring?

46:49.780 --> 46:51.780
Oh boy.

46:51.780 --> 46:52.780
Oh boy.

46:52.780 --> 46:54.780
Um, was this a yacht?

46:54.780 --> 46:56.780
What was this?

46:56.780 --> 46:58.780
Here's a new question.

46:58.780 --> 47:01.780
Last Halloween, my wife and I never got around to carving the pumpkin

47:01.780 --> 47:02.780
our best friend brought us.

47:02.780 --> 47:05.780
Instead of tossing it, our friend hid it in our bathtub as a joke

47:05.780 --> 47:07.780
slash gentle reminder to carve it.

47:07.780 --> 47:10.780
Unfortunately, my wife and I proceeded to keep it in the tub

47:10.780 --> 47:14.780
while using the tub as usual for the next four months?

47:14.780 --> 47:17.780
It was surprisingly useful for many tub related act...

47:17.780 --> 47:19.780
Is this where we're at?

47:19.780 --> 47:21.780
What does that mean?

47:21.780 --> 47:25.780
It was surprisingly useful for many tub related activities.

47:25.780 --> 47:29.780
What do you do in the tub?

47:29.780 --> 47:32.780
Flash forward to yesterday and the pumpkin.

47:32.780 --> 47:33.780
You guys are never going to believe this.

47:33.780 --> 47:36.780
Well, it's rotted in the dang tub, hasn't it?

47:36.780 --> 47:37.780
I cleaned it all up.

47:37.780 --> 47:40.780
But in the process, a not insignificant amount of pumpkin seeds

47:40.780 --> 47:44.780
and guts went down the already poorly functioning drain.

47:44.780 --> 47:46.780
If this causes a plumbing issue,

47:46.780 --> 47:49.780
how do we explain it to the landlord without him telling him

47:49.780 --> 47:52.780
we kept a pumpkin in the tub for four months?

47:52.780 --> 47:55.780
This is a large clawfoot tub with a shower head hookup.

47:55.780 --> 47:57.780
If that reference is needed, it wasn't.

47:57.780 --> 48:00.780
That's from punk and pumpkin.

48:00.780 --> 48:03.780
It's from a person who needs some help

48:03.780 --> 48:07.780
and a help on a scale that may be grander than we can offer.

48:07.780 --> 48:10.780
I think the best course of events...

48:10.780 --> 48:11.780
Really?

48:11.780 --> 48:13.780
Yeah, I really think.

48:13.780 --> 48:15.780
You have to remember, I do these questions, right?

48:15.780 --> 48:18.780
So I saw this hours ago.

48:18.780 --> 48:20.780
I've had time to process it, boys.

48:20.780 --> 48:25.780
And the thing is, I think you are going to get the most leeway

48:25.780 --> 48:29.780
by just telling the landlord what you did.

48:29.780 --> 48:33.780
We left a pumpkin in the tub for four months while tubbing around it

48:33.780 --> 48:35.780
and some things went bad.

48:35.780 --> 48:39.780
Doing the usual tub stuff that we found the pumpkin to be

48:39.780 --> 48:41.780
surprisingly complimentary to.

48:41.780 --> 48:45.780
We were in there thumping around, and it rotted away.

48:45.780 --> 48:47.780
It got in the ding-ding drain, didn't it?

48:47.780 --> 48:50.780
This one's on us, and if you want to add an extra $20 to our rent

48:50.780 --> 48:52.780
for the next couple of months, we totally understand.

48:52.780 --> 48:53.780
We totally get it.

48:53.780 --> 48:56.780
For a pumpkin surcharge, the usual.

48:56.780 --> 48:59.780
The usual pumpkin mistake surcharge, please.

48:59.780 --> 49:02.780
What's your usual... Excuse me, is this landlord?

49:02.780 --> 49:04.780
What's your usual rate for making a pumpkin mistake?

49:04.780 --> 49:06.780
Hypothetically speaking.

49:06.780 --> 49:09.780
And is that kind of something that I can purchase prophylactically?

49:09.780 --> 49:14.780
I notice here that there is in the lease a listing for pet addendum.

49:14.780 --> 49:15.780
So I understand that.

49:15.780 --> 49:17.780
My pet's a pumpkin that lives in my tub.

49:17.780 --> 49:19.780
And he had an accident.

49:19.780 --> 49:21.780
He had an accident of dying.

49:21.780 --> 49:23.780
And so we need an emergency here.

49:23.780 --> 49:25.780
Excuse me, is this landlord?

49:25.780 --> 49:28.780
There is an emergency here, and it is of a pumpkin variety,

49:28.780 --> 49:30.780
and this is covered in my lease, I bet.

49:30.780 --> 49:31.780
So what was the damage...

49:31.780 --> 49:35.780
And if it's not specifically in the lease, that's a relief for me, honestly.

49:35.780 --> 49:39.780
Can you forward me the list of things we are allowed to get stuck in the tub

49:39.780 --> 49:40.780
drain, please?

49:40.780 --> 49:41.780
And is pumpkins one of them?

49:41.780 --> 49:42.780
You could just tell me that.

49:42.780 --> 49:46.780
What are some things that you allow in tub?

49:46.780 --> 49:48.780
Oh, you don't have a comprehensive list.

49:48.780 --> 49:52.780
Hmm, seems like a lack of forethought on your part.

49:52.780 --> 49:56.780
Do you recall... Excuse me, this is Dilip in the apartment you have.

49:56.780 --> 50:01.780
Do you remember a green mutually beneficial list of things that can go in tub?

50:01.780 --> 50:02.780
You remember.

50:02.780 --> 50:04.780
Okay, we'll clarify.

50:04.780 --> 50:07.780
Is there a limit to how long I was allowed to keep pumpkin in tub?

50:07.780 --> 50:12.780
Because I will tell you for future reference, four months is too long.

50:12.780 --> 50:19.780
To be fair, sir, before you get all high and mighty about it, to be fair,

50:19.780 --> 50:23.780
if you noticed that pumpkin had not been removed from my home by December,

50:23.780 --> 50:26.780
that would have been the moment for you to speak up as my landlord

50:26.780 --> 50:28.780
if you were really paying attention to the problem.

50:28.780 --> 50:31.780
And to be fair, you take a tub in my apartment every week,

50:31.780 --> 50:34.780
so you must have noticed, right?

50:34.780 --> 50:37.780
I'm sorry, I want to engage here.

50:37.780 --> 50:46.780
I want to have fun, but once I used a foot bath in Japan that had yuzu fruit

50:46.780 --> 50:50.780
floating in it and it made the water smell, and oranges, and it made the water

50:50.780 --> 50:55.780
smell pretty good that I had my feet in, and it was revitalizing.

50:55.780 --> 51:03.780
This pumpkin, I cannot imagine, served a similar purpose and also was something

51:03.780 --> 51:09.780
you had to bathe around while it's so big a pumpkin is.

51:09.780 --> 51:11.780
I understand your confusion, Griffin.

51:11.780 --> 51:15.780
It's a large clawfoot tub with a showerhead hookup.

51:15.780 --> 51:18.780
So I think that that kind of clears it up.

51:18.780 --> 51:19.780
Yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense.

51:19.780 --> 51:25.780
So you were showering in there and just you had pumpkin on the foot?

51:25.780 --> 51:26.780
And it has claw feet.

51:26.780 --> 51:28.780
And the tub has claw feet.

51:28.780 --> 51:30.780
Okay.

51:30.780 --> 51:32.780
Oh, with the claw feet.

51:32.780 --> 51:37.780
Yeah, because of the claw feet, sometimes the pumpkin's just going to get lost in there.

51:37.780 --> 51:42.780
So I guess let's just take turns apologizing, because we fucked up.

51:42.780 --> 51:44.780
We didn't realize the tub had claw feet.

51:44.780 --> 51:45.780
I thought it was a built-in.

51:45.780 --> 51:46.780
I'm sorry.

51:46.780 --> 51:49.780
It's not a built-in, it's a standalone deal with a showerhead hookup.

51:49.780 --> 51:50.780
I'm sorry.

51:50.780 --> 51:51.780
Oh, man.

51:51.780 --> 51:52.780
Oh, now.

51:52.780 --> 51:54.780
Now who left a pumpkin in the tub?

51:54.780 --> 51:58.780
Still you, actually.

51:58.780 --> 52:00.780
We don't know how big a pumpkin.

52:00.780 --> 52:06.780
It could have been one of those small, paint a funny face on it and put it on the table

52:06.780 --> 52:07.780
by the door.

52:07.780 --> 52:08.780
No, it's big.

52:08.780 --> 52:09.780
It's a big pumpkin.

52:09.780 --> 52:10.780
It's big.

52:10.780 --> 52:12.780
You don't send a question like this to us if it's not a full-size pumpkin.

52:12.780 --> 52:15.780
Yeah, it would have headed over to ask John and Hank.

52:15.780 --> 52:16.780
You know what I mean?

52:16.780 --> 52:17.780
They handle the tiny pumpkin stuff.

52:17.780 --> 52:18.780
They handle that.

52:18.780 --> 52:21.780
Yeah, hey, I think it's dear Hank and John, but a great try.

52:21.780 --> 52:23.780
No, they started a second show.

52:23.780 --> 52:24.780
Sure.

52:24.780 --> 52:26.780
Hey, let's talk about this for a second.

52:26.780 --> 52:29.780
I'm going to keep drilling down on parts of this until it seems less insane.

52:29.780 --> 52:32.780
Flash forward to yesterday and the pumpkin is rotten in the tub.

52:32.780 --> 52:35.780
Let me hold up for just one second.

52:35.780 --> 52:38.780
You don't get to flash forward to the pumpkin is rotten in the tub.

52:38.780 --> 52:41.780
You go in the tub every single day.

52:41.780 --> 52:47.780
You did not come in one day and like, holy shit, look what happened to our pristine pumpkin.

52:47.780 --> 52:48.780
Yeah.

52:48.780 --> 52:50.780
No, that's not how it shook out.

52:50.780 --> 52:56.780
A swarm of locusts did not fly in through the window and fuck your pumpkin up over like a two-hour period.

52:56.780 --> 52:58.780
And question asker.

52:58.780 --> 53:03.780
You didn't lift it up for one of your regular bathtub activities and the bottom just fell out.

53:03.780 --> 53:05.780
Were you using it as a loofah?

53:05.780 --> 53:06.780
You can tell me.

53:06.780 --> 53:07.780
I'm not going to be angry.

53:07.780 --> 53:08.780
I'll be a little angry.

53:08.780 --> 53:12.780
You would certainly notice at what point in the decompositional process it was-

53:12.780 --> 53:13.780
Yeah.

53:13.780 --> 53:17.780
Any sponginess whatsoever should have been sign one that this pumpkin was-

53:17.780 --> 53:22.780
Four months is a tremendous amount of time for a pumpkin to be extant.

53:22.780 --> 53:23.780
Huge.

53:23.780 --> 53:32.780
Not to continue the scrutiny here, question asker, but in the cleaning process, a not insignificant amount of pumpkin seeds and guts went down the already poorly functioning drain.

53:32.780 --> 53:35.780
How loosey goosey was your cleaning process?

53:35.780 --> 53:36.780
Yeah.

53:36.780 --> 53:39.780
It was getting pushed into the drain and you just thought, well, cost of doing business.

53:39.780 --> 53:40.780
Yeah.

53:40.780 --> 53:44.780
That's the number one area you got to defend if you are cleaning.

53:44.780 --> 53:51.780
I leave a pumpkin out in front of the house for three days past Halloween and it is deflated.

53:51.780 --> 53:54.780
It is a deflated pumpkin sitting out there.

53:54.780 --> 53:59.780
There is no way, no way it made it four months in a tub.

53:59.780 --> 54:00.780
Absolutely not.

54:00.780 --> 54:12.780
Maybe you've hit on a new pumpkin preservation technique whereby getting some fruit-tastic shampoo on it or whatever, you're going to keep it alive a little bit longer.

54:12.780 --> 54:14.780
We should all be submerging our pumpkins.

54:14.780 --> 54:18.780
So if you want to preserve your pumpkins, you can only find them usually that one time of year.

54:18.780 --> 54:23.780
So it's nice to have a pumpkin on hand for spring to really welcome the Easter Bunny in a way that's going to fuck them up.

54:23.780 --> 54:24.780
Yep.

54:24.780 --> 54:25.780
Right.

54:25.780 --> 54:27.780
You really want to confuse that cat.

54:27.780 --> 54:30.780
Hey, listen, thanks so much for listening to our podcast.

54:30.780 --> 54:31.780
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

54:31.780 --> 54:35.780
I guess this is the last one before we head into a bit of a hiatus.

54:35.780 --> 54:39.780
Yes, it will be strange for a while.

54:39.780 --> 54:40.780
Yeah.

54:40.780 --> 54:42.780
We got some other fun, weird stuff for you though.

54:42.780 --> 54:44.780
And things are turning around.

54:44.780 --> 54:52.780
They're turning around here on Earth and I think brighter days are ahead, if that is any consolation to you.

54:52.780 --> 54:54.780
That's where I'm at right now.

54:54.780 --> 54:55.780
Okay.

54:55.780 --> 54:56.780
Yeah.

54:56.780 --> 54:57.780
Here's hoping.

54:57.780 --> 55:01.780
Thank you to you for joining us once again.

55:01.780 --> 55:04.780
And we want to tell you, we got a lot of cool merch over in the merch store.

55:04.780 --> 55:08.780
We're running out of time for that March merch pin of the month.

55:08.780 --> 55:11.780
It's sausage to me, which benefits feeding Texas.

55:11.780 --> 55:13.780
You can also check out the empty bowl pin.

55:13.780 --> 55:14.780
That one is evergreen.

55:14.780 --> 55:19.780
So that is not a monthly pin as well as the 20 big dog run pin is going to be there.

55:19.780 --> 55:22.780
Go pre-order the Adventure Zone Crystal Kingdom graphic novel.

55:22.780 --> 55:25.780
You can pre-order that at theadventurezonecomic.com.

55:25.780 --> 55:27.780
It comes out July 13th.

55:27.780 --> 55:34.780
I've been doing a Twitch channel for a while now, twitch.tv slash the Travis McRoy.

55:34.780 --> 55:36.780
Don't forget to check out our YouTube channel.

55:36.780 --> 55:39.780
If you haven't done that in a while, just search McRoy family and you'll find it.

55:39.780 --> 55:45.780
Thank you to Montane for creating our wonderful new theme music, which we love very much.

55:45.780 --> 55:46.780
Yes.

55:46.780 --> 55:48.780
It's called My Life is Better with You.

55:48.780 --> 55:54.780
And go check out all of Montane's music and make sure that you support her during Eurovision.

55:54.780 --> 55:57.780
Is there like a phone vote system?

55:57.780 --> 56:00.780
Not, I don't think us Americans can get in on it.

56:00.780 --> 56:02.780
Damn it.

56:02.780 --> 56:04.780
Just another thing we're kept out of.

56:04.780 --> 56:05.780
Right.

56:05.780 --> 56:07.780
Hey, do y'all want a final Yahoo?

56:07.780 --> 56:08.780
Please.

56:08.780 --> 56:11.780
Okay, this final Yahoo was sent in by Merritt Palmer.

56:11.780 --> 56:12.780
It's a very good one.

56:12.780 --> 56:13.780
Thank you, Merritt.

56:13.780 --> 56:14.780
It's an anonymous.

56:14.780 --> 56:15.780
Oh no, it's John.

56:15.780 --> 56:19.780
The Yahoo Answers user John asks,

56:19.780 --> 56:25.780
why is the company called Johnson and Johnson and not the two Johnsons?

56:29.780 --> 56:30.780
My name is Justin McElroy.

56:30.780 --> 56:31.780
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:31.780 --> 56:33.780
I'm Griffin McElroy.

56:33.780 --> 56:34.780
This has been my brother, my brother.

56:34.780 --> 56:53.780
May kiss your dad, square on the lips.

57:04.780 --> 57:07.780
My life is better with you.
