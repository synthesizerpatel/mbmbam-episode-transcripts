00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists. He's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

01:40.780 --> 01:45.180
Just like get on board and get on board the game cuz it's a good game that I've invented

01:45.180 --> 01:50.460
Okay, just don't try just start now. Okay, so here's how it works. I started following this Twitter account

01:51.180 --> 01:53.780
That is SNL hosts intro

01:53.780 --> 01:58.340
Okay, and it's SNL like the you know the performer guest

02:12.140 --> 02:15.260
It's selling that they're excited to be introing

Okay up first now. I want you to think what do I know about these two people right?

02:29.340 --> 02:32.260
And I think that this is gonna be an easy one to ease us in right

02:32.860 --> 02:34.860
Courtney Cox

02:35.220 --> 02:41.400
Introducing Dave Matthews band. This is important Courtney Cox recording Cox our cat. This is Courtney Cox

02:41.900 --> 02:45.460
Okay, okay the original. Okay. I think she's gonna be like

This okay. That's I think we're guessing the tone, right? Yes. It's like excite excited for you

02:51.980 --> 02:55.240
At your bachelorette party. All I know is that she's going to

02:56.020 --> 03:01.300
Absolutely scream the name Dave Matthews band. Okay. See I don't think that here's what I'm predicting

03:01.300 --> 03:07.460
I'm predicting like I'm excited. I got this for you as a bachelorette party present. Yeah, I know this is your favorite band

03:07.460 --> 03:13.660
I'm not that excited to see them but like here they are. I got them I booked them, right? Okay, let's let's hear it

03:13.660 --> 03:15.700
Ladies and gentlemen, Dave Matthews band

03:16.620 --> 03:21.300
Not even a little bit not that level of excitement not any level of excitement

03:21.300 --> 03:26.420
It's like she's introducing the speaker for like an off off off off off Broadway TED talk

03:26.420 --> 03:32.460
It's nothing a different Dave Matthews band. Yeah, it was originally gonna do it and this bad new

03:34.180 --> 03:37.700
She met Dave Matthews band backstage and did not care for

03:37.700 --> 03:40.180
A big jar of relish

03:42.940 --> 03:49.740
This is shortly after they pooped on a boat and so she's like, I don't want to be associated with necessarily

03:50.660 --> 03:52.660
Okay up next

03:53.300 --> 03:55.180
Ben Affleck

03:55.180 --> 03:59.500
Yeah, introducing Nelly. Okay, he had been Affleck knows

04:00.460 --> 04:06.220
How important it is that he be fully fully enthused for announcing Nelly

04:06.220 --> 04:13.380
he understands the optics he's going to be very excited like he just walked into the club and

04:13.820 --> 04:20.680
Saw Nelly performing. I think he's going to have the energy of somebody introducing like

04:21.380 --> 04:28.420
The poet laureate like a seriousness like it's time for you all to experience Nelly

04:28.820 --> 04:32.660
Let's take a listen. Ladies and gentlemen, Nelly featuring Jaheem. Oh

04:32.660 --> 04:34.660
Wow

04:35.900 --> 04:38.740
Ladies and gentlemen, Nelly featuring Jaheem. I went

04:39.540 --> 04:46.060
Completely. I went to this man. It's been Affleck with it. I think Griffin kind of nailed it. Actually like yeah brace yourselves

04:46.100 --> 04:49.900
It's Nelly featuring Johnny time for the honored guest

04:52.500 --> 04:54.500
Ben

04:54.900 --> 05:00.460
Justin you and take a swing at like a good way to introduce Nelly. Yeah. Yeah, is it Jaheem Nelly?

05:00.460 --> 05:03.140
Yes, featuring Jaheem obviously

05:04.220 --> 05:07.500
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Nelly featuring Jaheem

05:08.380 --> 05:11.540
Whoa, that was good. That's pretty good. That's pretty good

05:11.540 --> 05:17.460
I mean you you legally have to say ladies and gentlemen, even though folks don't necessarily rock like that anymore

05:17.460 --> 05:24.680
Yeah, but I know I understand that. Yeah, I understand the difference but this is it's SNL baby. It's the old time

05:24.680 --> 05:30.320
The old good time show the old way this one. I'm excited to introduce to you

05:30.840 --> 05:34.300
Because of the combination of these three people Paul Giamatti

05:35.160 --> 05:41.040
Introducing ludicrous featuring some 41. Oh stoked out of his fucking mind

05:41.880 --> 05:47.000
Stoked out of his gourd if they had an orgy at the end of that our podcast would be the baby

05:47.860 --> 05:52.520
He's gonna be so excited that the energy might come off as aggressive

05:52.520 --> 05:55.740
Like he's he's so angry and happy to be announcing these

05:55.740 --> 05:59.740
This is my this is my okay my prediction for this one and I don't know

05:59.740 --> 06:06.300
I feel this way but I feel like Giamatti is bringing like corporate gig energy like he had like

06:07.200 --> 06:13.320
You know, I used to be big into wide but ever since I tried biller-light and seltzer's platinum, right?

06:13.320 --> 06:15.640
You know that kind of deal. Let's take a listen

06:16.200 --> 06:20.620
Ladies and gentlemen ludicrous featuring some 41. Oh, yeah, man

06:20.620 --> 06:27.540
Ladies and gentlemen ludicrous featuring some 41. That's how you do it. Actually. Yeah, that's like the best tone

06:27.660 --> 06:29.660
Yeah, that's good. I

06:30.100 --> 06:37.060
Suspected a bit of frenzy would slip into his voice, but that was just like let's get this place fucking right like he and he improved

06:37.500 --> 06:43.480
Their performance by getting the crowd psyched like maybe they weren't psyched to do it. But then it was sort of like

06:44.320 --> 06:47.260
You know what? We should give him the best show. Yeah

06:47.260 --> 06:51.020
Yeah, mm-hmm. We should try our absolute hardest

06:51.220 --> 06:57.220
And then he went then he goes and stands in front of the stage like a foot away from them and just like nods his

06:57.220 --> 07:00.940
head like vigorously like he's so and he's like conducting a

07:01.540 --> 07:07.140
And they're like, why is he conducting ludicrous featuring some 41? He's like this is this isn't my usual thing

07:07.140 --> 07:10.820
But these guys can really these guys can really whale like

07:10.820 --> 07:17.100
A bruise on this like like this feels like before he went out right?

07:17.100 --> 07:22.580
He was like, I don't know these are these people are and they had him like turn on some headphones and listen

07:22.580 --> 07:27.600
Like this is good. Actually, I could get down to this. I think I get it. Okay

07:28.580 --> 07:31.020
I'm ready up next Bernie Mac

07:31.780 --> 07:33.780
introducing good Charlotte

07:33.780 --> 07:40.500
Huh, I think if this is close to the end of show, this is actually important information. Is this the first

07:41.300 --> 07:45.900
Music act or the second music act. I don't believe any of these are second music

07:45.900 --> 07:51.660
I believe because none of them contain like once again or welcome back or any kind of yeah, that's a good point

07:51.660 --> 07:54.460
That's a good point. Cuz the second one is always always gonna be

07:55.020 --> 07:56.100
everyone

07:56.100 --> 08:02.740
Good Charlotte like that level and they've left it all out on the court by that point. Yeah, um, I'm been like

08:02.740 --> 08:03.900
the

08:03.900 --> 08:04.940
amusement

08:04.940 --> 08:09.980
Like he's he he believes that there he says there are people who like this music

08:09.980 --> 08:14.420
It's not my favorite music, but I recognize the actually completely agree with that energy

08:14.420 --> 08:17.820
He's not like pumped about it because he knows that you're gonna read that as phony

08:18.020 --> 08:23.560
Yeah, but he's like he's happy for you. He's pleased for you. Yeah, let's take a listen

08:23.560 --> 08:27.880
Gentlemen good shop. Nope. Good shop

08:30.800 --> 08:35.880
He was eating a big meatball sub backstage like hey you have to go introduce good Charlotte and he's like, okay

08:35.880 --> 08:40.160
Okay, and he walked out there and said it's good Charlotte and then walked back and within 10 seconds

08:40.160 --> 08:46.560
He had that sandwich right back in his mouth now. He's next to you. I would actually rather not guess beforehand

08:46.560 --> 08:48.960
Let's just listen and discuss them afterwards

08:48.960 --> 08:54.440
This is Phil Hartman introducing Bush. Wow. Wow

08:55.000 --> 08:57.800
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Bush

09:01.960 --> 09:05.440
It's like it's like he thinks that the band is going to spray a

09:06.240 --> 09:11.600
Neurotoxin into the studio into the studio Justin can also see the video though Justin

09:11.600 --> 09:18.360
Can you describe the he's looking directly at you like he's a James Bond villain and you're James Bond

09:18.360 --> 09:25.600
And he's like he's just found out that your secret weakness is Bush. Yeah, and he's like, oh you did, you know, well

09:27.600 --> 09:32.000
Yeah, it's it's a it's like levels of intensity that I can't quite communicate to you

09:32.120 --> 09:39.000
That do you have the year that Phil Hartman introduced Bush? Oh, no, I don't know the dates

09:39.160 --> 09:41.160
That was 1996

09:41.440 --> 09:43.440
Okay, is that good?

09:43.440 --> 09:49.120
Is that good or bad or how do you feel about that? Things were not great for Phil Hartman in 1996

09:50.840 --> 09:52.840
Stuff he was going through a time

09:53.440 --> 09:55.560
up next Nathan Lane

09:56.680 --> 10:03.160
Introducing Metallica and just play. Oh, yeah, really? Yeah, this happened

10:03.160 --> 10:07.680
Uh-huh, that's what I'm talking about

10:10.120 --> 10:17.800
Thank you for coming to the show Nathan that is how it is done fucking consummate performer everyone take notes

10:17.800 --> 10:20.000
I ain't notes from Nathan Lyon

10:20.000 --> 10:24.520
I don't know if Nathan Lane has ever listened to a Metallica song in his life

10:24.720 --> 10:26.720
but that is like a

10:26.720 --> 10:33.280
A dad like introing his kid like I yeah driving you and he just picked up Brady

10:33.280 --> 10:37.440
And he opens the sliding door in the Odyssey and he's like Brady

10:37.440 --> 10:40.840
Are you ready to go to Detroit to see?

10:41.520 --> 10:42.960
Metallica

10:42.960 --> 10:47.780
As long as we're sort of diving into the psyche of the get the hosts of this show

10:48.320 --> 10:53.800
1997 was when this episode came out around the same time that Nate Lane was in a little film called Mouse Hunt

10:53.800 --> 10:57.880
Yeah, he was rolling in the deep piles of Mouse Hunt money

10:57.880 --> 11:04.920
So he was like I too and yeah, he could be he could be introduced at anybody who'd like ladies and gentlemen

11:05.680 --> 11:08.920
Alert us boys like he would still put that stink on it

11:13.320 --> 11:16.160
If we next time we play in New York

11:16.160 --> 11:24.280
Could we pull strings to get Nathan Lane to introduce us in that exact in that exactly that would be incredible okay?

11:24.280 --> 11:28.600
I don't think I have a connection there, but I hope so whatever. I just gotta say what a pro

11:28.600 --> 11:34.880
What a pro okay one last one. Oh, no. This is the greatest one. I've ever it's not a dream Brody

11:34.880 --> 11:39.420
Is it no no not allowed to play a dream Brody, but like if you've never seen that one

11:39.420 --> 11:44.740
It sucks, okay here it is Daniel Craig

11:45.580 --> 11:47.580
introducing the weekend and

11:48.220 --> 11:50.980
Now don't play it yet. How do you think this one goes?

11:51.900 --> 11:58.460
Hmm. I messed up and loaded I could see the video portion of this okay, well then let Griffin guess first

11:58.500 --> 12:00.700
Yeah, I think he is

12:00.700 --> 12:08.620
Overjoyed okay, okay, Justin go ahead and play it ladies and gentlemen

12:09.260 --> 12:10.940
the weekend

12:10.940 --> 12:14.620
Now once again Justin could see the video the weekend

12:14.620 --> 12:21.040
It's like he can't believe someone is named the week. Yes my theory and Griffin now

12:21.040 --> 12:26.280
I'm gonna send it to you cuz you gotta see it my theory is that just before he went out

12:26.280 --> 12:32.780
Somebody told him the name and he believed that he was introducing the actual like concept of

12:34.060 --> 12:36.620
Yes, but he was like the weekend

12:38.220 --> 12:43.320
There's a shrug that goes with it like I and he shakes his head like the weekend

12:44.420 --> 12:46.260
Question mark in it. It would have been a lot more power

12:46.260 --> 12:51.860
This is worth know it's worth noting that this this a lot of the the other ones have been from an account

12:51.860 --> 12:53.860
That's full of these sorts of things

12:53.860 --> 12:59.220
That like like hosts introducing. This is an account that is called Craig weekend

12:59.220 --> 13:03.900
mm-hmm that has five hundred and seventeen thousand followers and

13:04.820 --> 13:12.940
They just tweet this every weekend. Yep, cuz he introduces the weekend. That's fun. It is fun. That's a good game trap

13:12.940 --> 13:16.700
Thanks. I enjoyed that that trip down memory lane. I always loved that juxtaposition of

13:18.040 --> 13:19.720
performer and

13:19.720 --> 13:21.060
host

13:21.060 --> 13:24.060
Do you think there is any thought to?

13:24.480 --> 13:30.060
How that'll go well not at all after a tree and Brody there probably is yeah

13:30.060 --> 13:37.160
I probably is a little script, you know you read what's interesting to me is the the tough part of constructing that game

13:37.180 --> 13:41.380
What's trying to find any video where the host seemed?

13:42.300 --> 13:47.420
Enthusiastic and it was Nathan Lane. That's it. Everybody else seems

13:47.420 --> 13:54.500
Oh to range between like I don't know and like I know it's weird that I'm saying it too

13:54.700 --> 13:55.180
Yes

13:55.180 --> 14:00.620
it was a pretty good bit one time where Harvey Cattell was the host and Madonna was the musical act and

14:00.780 --> 14:02.780
He said like I was so excited

14:03.100 --> 14:10.380
When I got here and our and I just had this realization that wow, I have a much more enthusiastic gay following than I realize

14:10.380 --> 14:17.420
Because Madonna is there it's good. Okay. So this is an advice show obviously

14:17.580 --> 14:23.500
Okay that like enough said right? So what we do on this show is you send us your questions. I'm gonna set it up

14:23.500 --> 14:28.020
Oh, here's the deal. Hey, okay. Will you send us your questions in BNB am at?

14:28.620 --> 14:31.060
Maximum fun org and we will answer your

14:31.660 --> 14:36.820
Questions if you need advice, we will help you where there will be other skits

14:36.820 --> 14:42.460
It's good to have bits. I would say there'll be skits. Actually, I don't have any there's no bits scheduled for this

14:42.460 --> 14:44.460
I just did kind of a bit

14:44.500 --> 14:47.980
Okay, I guess get oh did it? Okay, that's fair. Yeah. Yeah

14:48.700 --> 14:50.940
But let's get into it. Let's help people

14:50.940 --> 14:56.100
I want to try to help more people than we have been helping because I feel like that's our real legacy

14:56.100 --> 15:00.780
Well spending spending 11 minutes talking about SNL insurance is a bad way to start

15:01.860 --> 15:04.980
Hey, hey, it's been 17 minutes

15:04.980 --> 15:09.940
I told my boss that I have jury duty on Monday, which I normally have off

15:09.940 --> 15:12.960
I gave the correct date, but the wrong day

15:13.060 --> 15:18.260
It turns out my jury duty is on Tuesday, and I'll subsequently need that day off a

15:18.780 --> 15:22.320
Game that I'm openly a fan of is releasing on Tuesday

15:22.320 --> 15:28.440
I don't want her to suspect that I'm trying to fake jury duty and actually taking off for video games

15:28.860 --> 15:33.060
How do I break it to her that I got the day wrong without seeming suspicious?

15:33.060 --> 15:36.700
That's from misremembered in, Missouri

15:38.020 --> 15:43.820
I think that this might be like a quantum mechanics problem in which by which I mean

15:44.220 --> 15:47.520
The very don't understand that I don't understand it

15:47.520 --> 15:51.580
No, the very fact that you have I don't think your boss would have thought this

15:51.900 --> 15:58.020
But now that you're worried about it, you have caused through observation this thing to change

15:58.540 --> 16:00.540
right now because now

16:00.540 --> 16:06.300
Whatever energy you're going to bring to like actually I got the I got the day wrong as Tuesday

16:06.760 --> 16:09.540
will have an undercurrent of

16:10.140 --> 16:13.840
I hope they don't think this is about me playing a video game

16:14.620 --> 16:19.500
And they'll be able to smell it on you. Okay, a couple of good options. What's the game first off?

16:19.500 --> 16:24.300
I got a figure. I mean, yeah, I was looking through recent game releases. Is it cod?

16:24.300 --> 16:27.340
I don't know. It might be cod. They might need

16:27.340 --> 16:31.420
This is the new question. I'd be a franchise because why would you be I was about to say

16:31.420 --> 16:33.540
Why would you be a fan of a new game? It hasn't released yet

16:33.540 --> 16:37.700
But people do that all the time. It seems enough to yell at people on the internet about it. Yeah

16:38.900 --> 16:43.280
Let's see. Let's assume it's Call of Duty because I don't like that. I can't be bothered and we all love it

16:43.280 --> 16:49.800
Like we all call a zero problems with love how serious it is and like not fun. Well, it's really cool

16:50.140 --> 16:52.720
So okay, here's my options one

16:52.720 --> 16:59.680
one loudly like start get a video game magazine from the newsstand just be like

17:01.280 --> 17:03.120
Can't believe this

17:03.120 --> 17:08.160
This new Call of Duty is stinks. They said no you shouldn't even get it. Yeah, that's one way

17:08.160 --> 17:11.040
It's to try to decrease but like I wouldn't do that. Here's how I do

17:11.760 --> 17:14.000
Why did you even say why did you even say it?

17:14.000 --> 17:19.200
Hey guys, this next one's a little more treacherous, but then why even introduce such a shitty idea

17:19.200 --> 17:22.520
You could here's that because this next one is treacherous

17:22.520 --> 17:28.200
Oh and I need to say that you should definitely do the first one before I mention that you should definitely do the second one

17:28.200 --> 17:29.280
Okay

17:29.280 --> 17:36.080
Hire someone to come in and intimidate you. Whoa. Wait, what at your place of business awesome

17:36.360 --> 17:41.160
Hire someone to come in and intimidate you be like, you know

17:41.160 --> 17:48.440
Oh, I you know, I heard that you I you know, Paul Calcutta is a good guy

17:48.440 --> 17:52.720
And I think you would never run a red light. Don't you think?

17:53.240 --> 17:57.320
Mr. Guy who loves having all his teeth. Oh and then cracks his knuckles like

17:58.160 --> 18:03.680
That's what Paul Calcutta is means to me. We what does Paul Calcutta mean to you?

18:03.680 --> 18:11.000
When you think when you hear the name Paul Calcutta, what do you think do you think innocence me too?

18:11.040 --> 18:16.440
Yeah, well that the juror wouldn't know the name. I think right. I've never had jury duty

18:16.440 --> 18:21.820
So he does now you're gonna have to fake it a lot of a lot of it's gonna be staged

18:21.840 --> 18:22.320
Yeah

18:22.320 --> 18:29.360
So they're not gonna have any way of checking up on Paul Calcutta and his case and if the name is Paul Calcutta

18:29.360 --> 18:36.120
Are any of okay wait one step further Justin and then one step further than that then the intimate already infallity territory

18:36.680 --> 18:41.560
Person says so if I was you I just stay home and play you a little video game. You're so excited

18:42.320 --> 18:47.800
No, hear me out. Hear me out. And then question asker goes no as much as I love that video game

18:47.800 --> 18:52.840
I love justice more. I will not be intimidated Paul Calcutta is going down

18:53.320 --> 18:55.320
Yeah, that's awesome

18:55.320 --> 19:01.640
And then your boss dad. Yeah, call Paul Calcutta's dad on the phone and let me tell him to tell it say his goodbyes

19:01.760 --> 19:07.360
Yeah, no, you know what? I'll call him. Hey call me Paul Calcutta's dad's phone number

19:07.360 --> 19:12.200
I just wanted to check to make sure that I had prepaid for that video game so I can pick it up before jury duty

19:12.360 --> 19:16.640
Okay. Yeah, I'll talk to you later. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Thanks. Yeah, I told his dad what's up

19:17.640 --> 19:20.320
Fuck you. Mr. Calcutta now here

19:20.320 --> 19:25.240
I hear it. Here's another thing. I'll say there is a way that

19:26.000 --> 19:33.420
You know por que no los dos like you if you go to jury duty Tuesday morning, and you're like

19:35.120 --> 19:37.120
This man's guilty

19:37.880 --> 19:41.640
Don't even let him open his mouth everybody we can all see it, right?

19:42.240 --> 19:49.080
We know this man's guilty throw the proverbial book in him five years. Yeah, sounds good. Okay

19:49.080 --> 19:55.120
that's a great day everybody good during I gotta get I got a hot get home the downloads almost completed and

19:55.720 --> 20:01.620
I'm gonna crank crank it out. Oh, no, I got steam link. It's fine guys. I got steam like

20:03.280 --> 20:07.860
Trial started start over trial start over. I got steam link

20:09.160 --> 20:13.280
Anyone else think this guy's got big stabbing energy I do

20:13.280 --> 20:20.320
I do. He's covered in blood. What are you talking about? Oh, you can't see it. Do a guilty now judge

20:20.480 --> 20:25.040
You just say it we can all go home play Call of Duty. Oh fuck. Yeah, is that out today? Yeah, it's out today

20:25.040 --> 20:27.800
It's out today. I hold myself in contempt

20:28.920 --> 20:36.560
We haven't started what we haven't started yet. What you can't handle the truth. I'm I'm leaving you can't leave

20:36.560 --> 20:41.920
You can't go someone fingerprint the judge. I

20:43.560 --> 20:50.440
Want a suspicious eye he's got big step final touch the evidence. How do I know it's not a hologram?

20:51.440 --> 20:53.320
Really that judge?

20:53.320 --> 20:55.320
Hey

20:55.400 --> 20:58.780
Could it have been the Riddler I said riddle and we all thought it did we

21:00.440 --> 21:03.280
Hey, how do you know I'm not a judge, huh?

21:03.280 --> 21:05.280
I

21:05.960 --> 21:08.240
We didn't vote on who the judge would be

21:09.040 --> 21:14.680
Can I be the bailiff this time? I'm not sure what he does, but I always like bull on night court

21:15.840 --> 21:20.520
several times during your your interview to see if you're a suitable juror just stand up and

21:20.720 --> 21:25.440
Produce a knife from your pocket and stab it into the table like in 12 angry men. Yeah

21:25.440 --> 21:28.120
I'm gonna like yeah, that's nothing right now you like oh, sorry

21:28.120 --> 21:30.720
And then you do it like five minutes later like shake out

21:30.720 --> 21:34.000
You guys got to tell me when it's time for me to stab my little knife into the table

21:34.000 --> 21:36.320
Oh, I keep trying to introduce evidence

21:38.800 --> 21:42.000
That's a subway coupon with like six punches out of it

21:42.680 --> 21:49.400
Exactly. I think we all know what this means. I only need four more punches till I get a free footlong

21:50.440 --> 21:52.440
Interesting, isn't it? What a coincidence

21:54.120 --> 21:56.120
How about another question yeah, sure, I

21:56.520 --> 22:00.160
Don't have a dog, but I love dogs. I see them out and about I waved him

22:00.160 --> 22:02.440
I'll only get an uncomfortable wave from their owner

22:02.680 --> 22:06.120
How can I wave to just a dog without getting weird looks from humans?

22:06.160 --> 22:09.800
That's from incidental dog walker stalker in Denver. You cannot

22:11.000 --> 22:13.720
You can't do this thing. Yeah, you got a wink

22:14.760 --> 22:18.760
No, not that the wave is too big right, but you can do like a hey

22:18.800 --> 22:21.220
We're in this together a wink, you know kind of little thing

22:21.400 --> 22:25.480
So I used to do when I worked at PetSmart and I'd see a dog and like I didn't want to talk to the owner

22:25.480 --> 22:27.480
But I wanted the dog to know that I was glad they were there

22:27.480 --> 22:30.240
Yeah, yeah pound it

22:31.840 --> 22:33.840
They could go to the pound

22:37.960 --> 22:45.020
The thing about the wave or the wink is the wink is nothing but the problem with the wave is that's a human greeting

22:46.960 --> 22:48.400
If you want to smell well

22:48.400 --> 22:53.360
You can't smell the butt because the unless you're like really sneaky like and I'm talking

22:53.360 --> 22:57.640
Sam Fisher very ninja sneaky. Okay

22:58.600 --> 23:01.280
Can you smell the dog's butt for far away and have the dog know it?

23:03.200 --> 23:08.520
Just a sign of just like like a wave is kind of like a long-distance high-five when you think about it

23:08.520 --> 23:12.120
So like you kind of sniff like it was a butt and they're like, yeah

23:12.120 --> 23:16.480
That's but the problem with that is that it's very gross. Mmm. This is true

23:18.680 --> 23:22.160
Maybe when you wave in the human ways back say like that wasn't for you

23:22.160 --> 23:28.920
Yeah, that was kind of a power move is to have a dog treat and then you walk up like oh, hey

23:28.920 --> 23:30.600
I just happen to have this dog treat my pocket

23:30.600 --> 23:34.000
Can I give it to your dog at that point? The dog is like hey, if you say no to this

23:34.000 --> 23:39.720
I'll eat you in your sleep. Yeah, and so then you I'm out. I will I am now this person's dog

23:39.720 --> 23:42.400
It is that quick. It is that easy Jeremy

23:42.480 --> 23:49.280
Do you see this could happen like that Jeremy and I'm gone all these years spent together over on the toilet

23:49.280 --> 23:53.800
I forget what begging strips tastes like Jeremy. So just think about that

23:55.360 --> 24:01.880
Remember how you gave me some sort of pill this morning. They would never do that Jeremy. They they would never

24:04.920 --> 24:06.920
All right asked and answered I feel like

24:09.520 --> 24:15.800
Do I do another question I do have so I do have a phone line that connects me directly to the clouds where the wizard lives

24:15.800 --> 24:21.280
Um, yeah, let's do it. Let's do that before the money zone. Okay a lot of people sent this one in

24:21.280 --> 24:27.320
It's it's on wikiHow and it's just I guess nobody wrote it

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
It doesn't have anything. Did I write it?

24:30.280 --> 24:33.800
You may have written it. I mean if no one's gonna claim it I'll claim it

24:33.880 --> 24:39.700
This is how to get rid of a nickname and it's awesome. Ooh. Yeah, people get rid of a nickname

24:40.160 --> 24:43.640
Yeah, I hate my nickname and I want a new one. Well good news

24:43.640 --> 24:49.440
This article is gonna tell you exactly that. Um, so we're gonna start with part one challenging the nickname

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
there's a picture here of a

24:52.440 --> 24:57.840
person walking and they're wearing cargo shorts and a hip sort of rugby shirt and

24:58.880 --> 25:01.060
They look a lot like Zack Morris

25:02.000 --> 25:07.680
Which is only notable because in the picture there's a gentleman in the foreground who's yelling Zack attack

25:07.680 --> 25:15.240
Oh, and the the tip here is don't answer to a nickname you don't like if someone started calling you by a mean nickname or something

25:15.240 --> 25:17.240
You don't like the first step is to not respond

25:17.640 --> 25:23.000
Okay, that's cool. If you're Zack Morris and someone yells Zack attack and you don't even acknowledge them

25:23.200 --> 25:28.900
They're gonna probably follow you for a while going Zack took why wouldn't you like the nickname Zack attack?

25:28.900 --> 25:33.520
I kind of rules. Let's not listen. Okay, you're right. You're right shit. Here's the problem though. What?

25:33.520 --> 25:38.860
you're entering into a battle of wills right at that point because if the other person is

25:38.940 --> 25:43.580
Deeply committed to that becoming your nickname. It's not gonna be a one-time thing, right?

25:43.580 --> 25:51.100
They're gonna try to like catch you off guard because if you're a Zack and they're like Zack and you start to turn

25:51.100 --> 25:53.100
And then they go attack and you're like, yeah

25:54.300 --> 25:57.780
This is gonna freak this person's bean though, if they're like

25:57.780 --> 26:05.540
It's not good they're gonna go to someone and be like either I'm a ghost or Zack attack is a ghost

26:07.780 --> 26:13.080
Okay, ask friends to stop using a nickname that's an easy one good friends will understand and don't want to hurt your feelings

26:13.580 --> 26:18.000
You could say guys. I know you think it's funny to call me Zack attack, but I really don't like that nickname

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Just call me Zachary. Okay

26:21.900 --> 26:26.900
Yeah, that's a good one deal with a bully but that is calling you a nickname if they're calling you if it's a bully

26:26.900 --> 26:31.820
It'll be harder to confront them. Just ignore them and let them see it hasn't got to you, right?

26:32.460 --> 26:35.060
Like it has though doesn't it takes their power away?

26:35.060 --> 26:35.340
No

26:35.340 --> 26:39.580
Not if you do pretend good enough if bullies call you a name to show them you're not intimidated

26:39.580 --> 26:44.240
You're scared by looking in the eyes laughing and just walking away without looking back or you could say something like here we go

26:44.240 --> 26:49.460
Again, this is boring or why are you talking to me? I like that last one a lot actually

26:50.300 --> 26:54.740
But then the next one is I don't know why you keep calling me that but it's boring and I don't care

26:54.740 --> 26:58.740
Me thinks the Zach attack do protest it too much

26:58.740 --> 27:04.100
Yeah, that one might not have the power you're hoping for there of yes is boring

27:04.580 --> 27:07.780
What do you this isn't for you? Wait, hold on Zach attack

27:07.780 --> 27:13.740
Did you think I was calling you Zach attack for your entertainment because it's for my entertainment

27:13.740 --> 27:19.940
Was that not clear how this transaction was playing out? Oh, let me explain Zach attack. I'm a bully. I hate you

27:19.940 --> 27:25.060
Yeah, we are not you to define myself. Yeah, right because I am a very

27:25.700 --> 27:27.700
small person in my heart and

27:27.980 --> 27:33.380
So I need to feel big by making you feel bad and now that you've engaged with me and said that it makes you feel

27:33.380 --> 27:34.260
bored

27:34.260 --> 27:37.540
That's actually a negative thing. So I'm I'm fine with that actually

27:37.540 --> 27:42.420
Yeah, any any sort of thing that I can do to sort of steal your shine? Yeah, right amazing. I'm a hater

27:42.420 --> 27:49.100
I what don't you get bud my hater and now I'm drinking hater aid. I love it

27:49.100 --> 27:54.380
I live for it kick you in the butt. Yeah, that's right it and I don't care if you like that either Zach

27:54.380 --> 27:57.300
Oh, sorry. Wait, yeah, that felt good. Wait, Zach

27:57.900 --> 28:01.540
Zach kicking me in the butt. So boring. Why don't you leave?

28:02.380 --> 28:06.340
Why are you in the butt? Why don't you go away from me stinker?

28:06.820 --> 28:11.620
Introduce yourself at the start just introduce yourself casually by saying hey everyone. I'm Jill

28:11.620 --> 28:17.300
I don't know that I've introduced myself in a while not because I'm big shit, but also that I don't

28:18.060 --> 28:20.060
meet people meet people

28:20.940 --> 28:22.940
when I do I

28:23.260 --> 28:25.260
like require a

28:25.900 --> 28:30.700
Hype person not even a hype person but somebody who can literally just a hype person to the extent that

28:31.500 --> 28:38.780
Bernie Mac is a hype person for Charlotte. Oh, I was a good hype person for you. Yeah, so just something to say

28:38.780 --> 28:43.980
Everybody in this room Griffin didn't make the expectation setter. Yeah. Yes, exactly

28:44.820 --> 28:50.820
That's interesting because I was going to suggest a Herald which I think I've suggested quite often on this show a few times

28:50.820 --> 28:56.300
But it would be nice to just have somebody like as like an like a human auto correct

28:56.460 --> 28:59.740
That when someone's like hey Bobby and they just lean and go it's Bob

29:01.340 --> 29:02.740
It's Bob

29:02.740 --> 29:09.880
maybe you could get a cameo from Paul Giamatti just saying hey everyone, here's Griffin and then you can like

29:10.260 --> 29:15.140
You know hack into the speaker system of any party you're at just play that as you walk in. That's good

29:15.140 --> 29:19.560
Oh get a cameo from Nathan Lane. That's like he's only going by

29:20.300 --> 29:25.980
Griffin and then like you can play that anytime someone's like what's up Griffey and you're like, hold on

29:25.980 --> 29:29.440
Let me hold on. Wait a second. I have a very important cameo from Nathan Lane. I have to show you

29:29.440 --> 29:31.280
And

29:31.280 --> 29:37.480
Also last thing remember that nicknames don't last forever and then there's a picture of a woman saying little Zaki

29:37.680 --> 29:40.760
to a little boy and then as a grown-up she's like

29:41.760 --> 29:47.200
Zachary it's all she says is Zachary and then there's a period and she looks pretty serious

29:47.400 --> 29:53.800
So like but Zachary is smiling. So it looks like his his older mother is saying Zachary

29:53.800 --> 29:59.100
I can't talk to you something along those lines Zachary. I'm happy to present

30:02.680 --> 30:06.460
Zachary here is Bush. Can we just say that saying

30:07.160 --> 30:12.440
Nicknames don't last forever is a complete lie because there are many like

30:13.000 --> 30:19.020
Like people throughout history. It's like Stonewall Jackson. I've got no idea what that dude's first name is. I know I know

30:19.020 --> 30:25.580
Yeah, yeah, you could there's so me. I bet there's there's war heroes out there that you walk around and

30:26.180 --> 30:29.740
They were like in World War one or whatever and it's like tell me the story

30:30.260 --> 30:36.460
Grandpa about your friend. Oh, you mean big boner Joe like cuz that's what they called him out there

30:36.460 --> 30:38.460
That's rough out in the trenches

30:38.940 --> 30:42.860
It could be worse. I guess little little boner Bobby

30:42.860 --> 30:49.500
How are none of these suggestions in this like try to come up with a different better nickname? Well

30:49.500 --> 30:52.860
I think they just who if your name is Zachary

30:53.540 --> 30:55.540
That's all I would want to be called

30:56.080 --> 30:58.080
Fuck. Yeah

30:58.460 --> 31:02.980
Yeah, especially the last name is Levi and you can be Zachary Levi

31:03.540 --> 31:10.700
Star of Shazam. Why would you be Zachary Levi star of Shazam? If your name was Zachary Snackery. Oh

31:10.700 --> 31:11.940
Oh

31:11.940 --> 31:17.060
Here comes Zack attack and I would be like fucking do you guys know my last name?

31:17.380 --> 31:20.300
Just call me Zack snack. You've nothing else like

31:20.980 --> 31:23.540
But don't do that. Please. Call me by my full

31:24.260 --> 31:30.020
Christian holy shit, if your name is Zachary out there, by the way, I just gave you a pretty good nickname of Snackery

31:31.460 --> 31:39.300
That one works at pretty much every age so and they could call you Zachary. So like is that attack that bad?

31:39.300 --> 31:40.860
I

31:40.860 --> 31:42.860
Yeah, it's pretty proud. It's pretty rough

31:44.220 --> 31:48.900
Any more graph of Zachary nicknames, yeah, let me think

31:50.340 --> 31:52.700
Shackler Shackery. Well, that's pretty good

31:53.380 --> 31:57.980
John Zachary what if you like got went with a cameo idea, right?

31:57.980 --> 32:03.980
But it was like a live-action cameo and you paid like let's say like John Stamos, right to like walk by you

32:03.980 --> 32:07.300
And and say like, oh, hey, man, you've got a really cool vibe

32:07.300 --> 32:12.740
What's your name? And you say Zachary and John Stamos goes Zachary. What an amazing name

32:12.940 --> 32:16.500
Why would anyone call you anything of Evan Zachary?

32:16.500 --> 32:20.340
It's fake conversations going on so long so long

32:21.180 --> 32:25.620
I'm gonna know listen get I can get us out. We're going to the money zone. Come on

32:25.620 --> 32:37.380
I'm gonna stay here with John Stamos

32:38.740 --> 32:43.820
Brooklinen. Oh, no, I was gonna do it. Sorry tough. But Brooklinen makes great sheets and I love them

32:44.220 --> 32:48.980
no, see you don't even know what you're talking about Brooklinen actually makes great sheets and

32:49.940 --> 32:51.940
Everybody loves them, but it's beyond

32:51.940 --> 32:56.180
Sheets, they got something for everybody on your gift list

32:56.180 --> 32:58.420
You want a weighted blanket and a nice cozy robe?

32:58.460 --> 33:03.660
They did a fun thing where they you they could let you pick somebody to send a gift to that's fun

33:03.660 --> 33:07.180
I said, I know I sent a t-shirt to my wife

33:07.720 --> 33:11.700
Sydney and she was very weirded out because why did I do this for you?

33:11.700 --> 33:19.020
I said to me I said open the box and you'll see and is a very comfortable black t-shirt and she put it on right there

33:19.020 --> 33:23.660
In the kitchen, you know what? She said best t-shirt I ever wore Wow this black t-shirt ever wore

33:23.660 --> 33:27.140
I think she said it's so nice that the romance is still alive after all these years

33:27.140 --> 33:28.260
They're alive because you know

33:28.260 --> 33:34.620
Sometimes it's it's easy to remember to buy plain black t-shirts for your loved ones early on in the relationship

33:34.980 --> 33:41.180
But it's so easy to let that kind of flame die out and it's so good to hear that you are still

33:41.940 --> 33:45.380
delivering the heat after all and it's a great place to find a gift and

33:45.380 --> 33:49.900
It's not just Lennon's either they got candles eye masks and accessories

33:50.300 --> 33:54.580

I open I just wanted to say I open a Stitch Fix box earlier this week, and it was a fiver

34:20.580 --> 34:22.740
I kept all five. Oh, yeah, whoa

34:23.420 --> 34:27.380
Yeah, I usually keep a majority on but you know a fiver you got to talk about

34:27.380 --> 34:31.980
This is the time for me when Stitch Fix really shines

34:32.580 --> 34:34.580
And that is my friends sweater weather

34:35.220 --> 34:37.460
Because I don't know how they do it

34:37.460 --> 34:43.420
But every sweater Stitch Fix has ever sent me is a keeper

34:43.780 --> 34:49.420
It's that chunky sweater like they know me so well at this point

34:49.580 --> 34:53.460
They send me a sweater one time that just putting it on and I can't explain it

34:53.540 --> 34:59.540
Makes me feel like one of the assassins from Assassin's Creed. It's a hooded sweater. Does it have knives in it?

34:59.540 --> 35:03.460
I don't know Griffin, but there's something about it that makes me want to skulk

35:03.460 --> 35:08.140
Yeah, and listen, that's because my size my style. It's all my own

35:08.140 --> 35:11.660
It's about what suits me and what suits the moment and that's the thing man

35:11.660 --> 35:15.700
You go to a store and you're like none of these clothes are for me. This is not my store

35:15.700 --> 35:18.180
What am I doing here? This is not my beautiful life

35:18.180 --> 35:22.460
And that's why Stitch Fix is great because they get to know you they ask you questions

35:22.620 --> 35:30.260

37:06.420 --> 37:10.740
Obstacles that our world and our brains throw in front of us depression anxiety

37:11.380 --> 37:17.020
Traumatic stress all those mental health challenges that are way more common and more treatable than you might think

37:17.300 --> 37:21.340
The first time I went to therapy I was so ashamed and I was like can't believe I gotta go in there

37:21.340 --> 37:24.580
Like I thought I could be a man and comfy book art was never in therapy

37:24.580 --> 37:28.860

Don't don't don't I want to munch do house. Wait, but it's not it's not over anymore

38:05.540 --> 38:10.660
Welcome on squad. It's podcast within podcast profiling the latest and greatest in we've

38:11.220 --> 38:16.320
Here's the first thing I say to you people. Yes, everyone tweeted me about Arby's

38:16.860 --> 38:18.860
Making vodka listen folks

38:18.860 --> 38:24.420
This is much squad. It's not the thirsty zone. Okay. No, we're for it for

38:25.060 --> 38:26.500
sawbones

38:26.500 --> 38:29.260
Yes, it's the thirsty zone. Okay

38:29.980 --> 38:36.260
Arby's drops limited edition curly fry and crinkle five vodka is vodka based on their fries. Okay?

38:36.580 --> 38:40.140
This is much squad. We have standards. Okay. Yeah

38:40.660 --> 38:45.700
I'm gonna try to get some of it. Okay, I'm dry. I'm trying to get some of you

38:45.700 --> 38:49.780
I'm gonna try to get some of it. Okay. All right, I need you to do by the way

38:49.780 --> 38:51.780
Like a tasting video of that

38:52.740 --> 38:58.500
With Sydney because you'll lie and say it's good to seem cool and Sydney will be on. Yeah

38:58.980 --> 39:01.580
But here's the thing, right? Like this is what I want to try to get across

39:02.420 --> 39:09.740
I'm munch squad. I try to make a difference and there's if there's an exception I'll mention it, but I don't like these companies

39:10.420 --> 39:12.420
Just doing things

39:12.420 --> 39:17.660
To get the headlines. I'm on school. Yeah, they're just wanting the attention from munch squad

39:18.020 --> 39:22.900
Arby's doesn't think one good thing for Arby's would be vodka. You know what I mean?

39:22.900 --> 39:27.500
Like they don't think they're doing the right thing. So when you say thirsty zone, it's not just about drinks, right?

39:27.500 --> 39:33.380
They're acting thirsty, right? They're acting thirsty. Yeah. No, no. No, I should have been more clear about that for the beginning

39:33.380 --> 39:35.380
I see that now

39:35.380 --> 39:42.900
What do you I see it oh what I thought from five miles away my incredible rich

39:43.060 --> 39:46.100
Wait, I heard you don't have supervision

39:47.380 --> 39:49.460
Well in my bad form I have

39:50.660 --> 39:58.100
Okay, wait a minute if you know wait if you killed Justin to do this bit it was completely silent and outrageously

39:58.620 --> 40:00.620
fast I

40:00.620 --> 40:02.660
Think it's more of us. I used

40:02.660 --> 40:04.500
incredibly

40:04.500 --> 40:06.900
Fast-acting poison. I use Kuro

40:07.980 --> 40:11.340
Incredible fast-acting poison the modern beast

40:12.700 --> 40:14.700
The modern beast

40:15.380 --> 40:20.700
I'm getting confused by the Count Donut lore because I can't tell if he dies in you

40:20.900 --> 40:27.500
Like a Jekyll and Hyde thing or if you're he dies his body dies temporarily by which I mean his soul

40:27.500 --> 40:35.660
Is sent to hell. Oh, wait, why all his body? Yeah spoiler and then control his body to

40:36.060 --> 40:39.280
Bring you the latest donut news. Okay, and then I

40:39.980 --> 40:45.220
Evacuate him back into the night or in this case the 1115

40:45.700 --> 40:49.100
But I really like listen Count Donut. I enjoy your presence

40:49.100 --> 40:54.860
But I did not realize it came with the cause of my older brother being temporarily in hell. Yeah, hell sucks

40:54.860 --> 40:57.900
Dude, it's but when he comes back, he appreciates things so much

41:03.980 --> 41:10.220
Yeah, do you know this one scene where they pull the gun on the man and then they say he will love breakfast tomorrow

41:10.220 --> 41:16.980
And it's supposed to be a thing that like you learn like oh nice, dude. Yes in the educational documentary fight

41:18.620 --> 41:20.620
Anyway, I'm here to talk about

41:20.620 --> 41:24.740
Donuts not Chuck Palahniuk. What?

41:28.780 --> 41:34.860
Krispy Kreme has announced it Halloween is over and on Justin's birthday

41:35.900 --> 41:38.380
November a very special day to Justin

41:39.100 --> 41:41.660
Krispy Kreme announced their thanksgiving

41:42.460 --> 41:44.460
Donut collection

41:45.820 --> 41:49.360
Krispy Kreme is encouraging Americans to share

41:49.360 --> 41:51.360
gobbles of gratitude

41:58.400 --> 42:01.360
With no doughnuts this Thanksgiving season as

42:02.560 --> 42:07.960
Boy, this is a kind of freshly. Sorry one second. I need to get to my compulsion

42:09.120 --> 42:13.860
as 80% of respondents in the national survey say

42:13.860 --> 42:19.820
Celebrating Thanksgiving is more important than in previous year. Oh boy. What?

42:20.580 --> 42:22.020
Why?

42:22.020 --> 42:29.260
And nearly half are planning to attend more Thanksgiving celebrations than they did before the COVID-19

42:29.820 --> 42:31.820
Pandemic. Yes good

42:32.260 --> 42:37.500
Hooray says Krispy Kreme people are doing a worse job than they did before

42:38.100 --> 42:40.100
They're getting even more nasty

42:40.100 --> 42:47.820
Than they did before COVID was a thing just pack them in like sardines and cranberry sauce

42:47.820 --> 42:49.820
They're nuts off

42:50.460 --> 42:54.340
Fantastic, I love this. I love suffering you do

42:56.300 --> 42:58.500
Thanksgiving is more important than previous years

42:58.500 --> 43:05.900
Here's a quote from Dave Skinner the chief marketing officer for Krispy Kreme listen

43:05.900 --> 43:10.500
We missed out on so much last year

43:13.700 --> 43:15.940
Including Thanksgiving celebrations

43:17.020 --> 43:19.580
This Thanksgiving people have a desire

43:20.660 --> 43:26.900
And need to be together more often and more so than any other Thanksgiving

43:28.540 --> 43:30.940
Nastier and rubbing more

43:30.940 --> 43:36.180
A lot more dry humping this year. Sneeze right on me Nami

43:36.580 --> 43:43.140
So we're creating a way to share your gratitude with others in the most delicious way possible

43:43.540 --> 43:48.360
Because nothing says thank you for having me to Thanksgiving like a box of doughnuts

43:48.360 --> 43:51.720
You bought the day before Thanksgiving because there's no way they're open

43:53.560 --> 43:58.420
According to a new survey even during this cooking and baking filled holiday

43:58.420 --> 44:02.820
56% of consumers plan to spend less

44:03.660 --> 44:05.660
traditional time in the kitchen

44:06.180 --> 44:11.100
In order to spend overdue time with miss family and friends

44:11.900 --> 44:13.900
That is a wild sentiment

44:15.060 --> 44:20.380
More than that. I wish Justin was here to talk about this because that's a truly wild

44:20.740 --> 44:23.340
I don't know how I'm supposed to gain literally

44:23.340 --> 44:27.260
I feel like I understand everything less than I did before I read that

44:27.260 --> 44:32.260
No insight has been important. I love that the insight Krispy Kreme took away though

44:32.260 --> 44:35.980
It's like okay spend less time in the kitchen. So you can spend more time with your family

44:36.180 --> 44:40.980
So they want to buy doughnuts from Krispy Kreme to include in Thanksgiving

44:41.620 --> 44:47.380
The idea that lunchtime comes around and everybody sits at the table and they're like, all right guys time to eat

44:47.380 --> 44:51.100
And then everybody just kind of looks at one another like who?

44:51.100 --> 44:56.420
Who cooked who cooked food for us? Oh, no

44:56.740 --> 44:59.780
No, none of us spend any time in the kitchen to enjoy your presence. Yeah

45:01.100 --> 45:03.100
so Krispy Kreme

45:03.300 --> 45:10.700
According to this new survey. I love the brand feels it needs science to justify the fact they made the fucking cranberry doughnuts

45:10.700 --> 45:16.300
I've never heard you cuss before. It was wise for us to do this our top top scientists

45:16.300 --> 45:23.100
We didn't want to but we follow the science we took this survey so we could prove to you that we don't need to make

45:23.180 --> 45:27.860
Thanksgiving doughnuts and you all were like nah, give me those fucking nasty doughnuts

45:27.860 --> 45:32.660
This is the problem Krispy Kreme started giving out doughnuts to vaccinated people

45:32.660 --> 45:36.540
But once you start following science, you cannot stop right?

45:36.700 --> 45:42.820
No one warns you that you're giving away everything at the altar of science. So here's the doughnuts, right?

45:43.500 --> 45:45.500
become pie

45:45.500 --> 45:47.500
What does they say about this one?

45:48.260 --> 45:51.800
pecan pie lovers will rejoice over this iconic

45:52.540 --> 46:00.300
Original glazed doughnut dipped in delicious butter tart filling then sprinkled with candied pecans and pie crust crumbles

46:00.300 --> 46:04.940
I'm all right, so the audience for that one is people who like

46:06.140 --> 46:12.740
To finally have something to be happy over because there hasn't been a lot of new innovation for pecan pie lovers

46:12.740 --> 46:17.220
Over the last like forever like they got the pumpkin pie and they're like, this is great

46:17.220 --> 46:22.540
I can't wait to see what comes next and then no one really ever did anything with it and finally something for them

46:22.540 --> 46:24.540
You know what I mean, right?

46:25.300 --> 46:28.900
Krispy Kreme guests can also express gratitude to loved ones

46:29.420 --> 46:36.460
friends and others by packaging their Thanksgiving collection doughnuts in Krispy Kreme's custom gratitude box

46:37.100 --> 46:39.100
while supplies last

46:39.100 --> 46:46.580
Which features a space to share gobbles of gratitude with someone special via a note on top

46:46.740 --> 46:49.740
So I can't you can't see this of course

46:49.740 --> 46:55.060
But what it is is a box from Krispy Kreme that has a white part at the top

46:55.060 --> 46:59.260
This is grateful for you because and in a blank space

46:59.780 --> 47:06.660
So Krispy Kreme says congratulations. We've done this for you. We've made it easier than ever to share your gratitude

47:06.660 --> 47:12.260
All right, son, get the sharpie and go to town. I just want to know I I know I've never said it before

47:12.260 --> 47:18.440
I just have never had the words but now that I have this box I can finally tell you well just read it

47:19.260 --> 47:20.820
okay, dad, it says

47:20.820 --> 47:23.500
