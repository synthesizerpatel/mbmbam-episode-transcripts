00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.760
Hello and welcome, my brother, my brother, and me in the advice show for the modern era.

00:47.760 --> 00:52.000
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.880
I'm your sweet, innocent, virginal baby, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.880 --> 01:00.080
Griffin, it sounds like you've been having kind of a rough morning in our pre-show.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.080
I don't really want to talk about it.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.480
No, no, say it. What's wrong? What's wrong?

01:04.480 --> 01:06.880
I just want to see what's wrong. I just want to check on you.

01:06.880 --> 01:10.000
It's concern. This is the sound of concern. This isn't for the show.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.040
We'll cut this out. We'll definitely cut this out.

01:13.040 --> 01:16.400
As long as you're speaking in confidence, I mean, I do edit the show, so I do have final

01:16.400 --> 01:20.960
agency, I guess, over the content of the show. But if you boys must know, I'm feeling a little bit of

01:20.960 --> 01:31.360
the old nip of the gypsy hooch. Your substance abuse is tearing our show apart.

01:31.360 --> 01:35.840
It's not substance. It's not substance. Here's my problem. Here's my problem.

01:37.440 --> 01:42.160
You're seeing a pattern develop, really. It's just two Saturday recordings in a row.

01:43.280 --> 01:47.120
It is Sunday. It's Sunday. Not like super good, Griffin.

01:47.120 --> 01:51.920
Two Sunday recordings in a row, where it was two birthday parties,

01:51.920 --> 01:56.560
day after birthday parties. My problem is when I get in a birthday party atmosphere.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.080
You eat all the cake.

01:58.080 --> 02:04.320
That's it. You're kidding. But once I have three or four Bud Light Limes in me,

02:05.440 --> 02:07.600
it's like cake patrol.

02:08.960 --> 02:13.360
I have a quote for you, Griffin. It seems like there's a birthday party every weekend.

02:13.360 --> 02:20.080
Jimi Hendrix. Okay? That's all. Motherfucker love cake. Think about it.

02:21.600 --> 02:26.880
That's my problem. I eat, and I eat, and I eat, because I don't have that part of my brain that's

02:26.880 --> 02:32.640
like, you already had a dinner. You don't need to have a second dinner, I don't think. Anyway,

02:32.640 --> 02:39.120
I'm glad this isn't going in the show, because I don't want that to be my character hook.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.720
The guy who wakes up hungover with terrible diarrhea.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.320
It's not terrible. It's not terrible. It's not great.

02:48.320 --> 02:51.440
Quantify your diarrhea. It's not ideal.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.080
Welcome to our new podcast, Quantify Your Diarrhea.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.920
Not ideal. Not the ideal diarrhea.

03:01.200 --> 03:04.880
Not the utopian ideal of diarrhea. Not the tasteful amount of diarrhea.

03:04.880 --> 03:09.440
Conceptually, I don't want to get blue right at the top, but conceptually,

03:09.440 --> 03:15.920
I don't have anything wrong with the idea of diarrhea. In fact, when painted in the right

03:15.920 --> 03:21.120
light, I think it could be seen as a very efficient way to void your bowels.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.280
All right, we're done here. I am a short lady.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.640
I'm just saying I'm a busy, busy man, and so-

03:27.440 --> 03:30.000
It'd be nice to just be able to hit the power button.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.280
Spend time, more time with the kids. Less time in the facilities.

03:35.280 --> 03:40.640
I'm a short lady, about five feet tall. I photograph a lot of conventions.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.680
I'm about to start working at a comic slash gaming convention.

03:44.240 --> 03:49.440
My nose is at armpit level, always. What is your advice for dealing with the gross,

03:49.440 --> 03:55.200
gross assault on my senses that result of very poor hygiene on behalf of thousands of

03:55.200 --> 03:58.000
wonderful, smelly nerds? That's from Gmail.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.200
This is a thing. If you don't-

04:01.200 --> 04:03.360
If you've never been a part of this atmosphere, it is-

04:04.320 --> 04:06.080
It is a thing. Oh, man.

04:06.880 --> 04:10.800
There, but for the grace of like 10 inches, go I.

04:10.800 --> 04:18.640
Because if I had to be down in that particular zone, that particular strato layer,

04:18.640 --> 04:19.920
God damn, though.

04:20.480 --> 04:26.960
I have found, interestingly enough, that individual people at these things don't smell bad.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.960
I think there's some sort of-

04:28.960 --> 04:30.240
It's a miasma.

04:30.240 --> 04:33.280
Pharma. It's a miasma. That's exactly right, Trav.

04:33.280 --> 04:37.040
There are certain notes from everyone's palate that are-

04:37.040 --> 04:42.080
And as the orchestra of stink comes together, it forms Peter and the Wolf.

04:42.080 --> 04:42.560
There's an-

04:44.640 --> 04:48.240
You just hear the piccolo. This person over here has a timpani.

04:48.240 --> 04:53.360
This person over here hasn't ever worn deodorant in their whole life.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.440
Do, do, do, do, do, do.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.960
Wash your fucking armpits.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.680
They smell bad. So, so bad. So very bad.

05:01.440 --> 05:02.800
I didn't know there were lyrics.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.120
I guess I learned something on today's podcast.

05:07.120 --> 05:11.520
I feel like it's not everybody at these conventions.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.560
I don't want to paint with a broad brush.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.800
Just say everybody who goes to shows stinks, because I go to these shows.

05:20.800 --> 05:21.840
Let me say this, though.

05:21.840 --> 05:25.040
It's not everybody, but it's also not always somebody else.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.440
It might be you.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.120
Interesting.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.880
Not you, Griffin. I mean, like the you.

05:30.880 --> 05:35.520
If you smell around the poker table and you don't smell the bad smell, you are the bad smell.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.120
You are this bad smell.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.920
You run into bad smells all day, you are the bad smell.

05:40.560 --> 05:45.280
If you keep find yourself wondering what is that and you're alone, it's you.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.240
It's always been you.

05:46.240 --> 05:49.280
Here's the thing. I don't think anybody should be personally offended by this question.

05:49.280 --> 05:54.080
I can understand all these guys. These guys are just being so mean about it.

05:54.080 --> 05:57.840
Listen, if you don't smell bad, we got no beef.

05:58.640 --> 05:59.440
You're great.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.080
If you do smell bad, get your stink right.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.120
Get your stink right.

06:03.120 --> 06:03.680
I mean, I get it.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.800
Like at a convention, you're on your feet all day running around.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.480
It's close quarters.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.320
Sometimes it gets hot up in that piece, depending on what piece you're in.

06:14.880 --> 06:15.440
Oh, God.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.800
On the show floor, those things.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.880
The worst, that would be my first, like, we're offering practical advice.

06:20.880 --> 06:27.680
I know, like, for example, if you're doing PAX East, there's a sky bridge where-

06:27.680 --> 06:29.600
You gotta avoid those bottlenecks at all costs.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.800
Oh, yeah. Avoid the bottlenecks.

06:30.800 --> 06:34.800
Get on the sky bridge and take shots of the show floor from there.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.000
They're gonna look very dramatic.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.560
And if you get a zoom lens, you'll never have to go down there.

06:41.920 --> 06:46.480
It is not an atmosphere that is conducive to good smelling.

06:46.480 --> 06:53.200
Like, I think fucking Herbal Essences could have a convention at the LA Convention Center,

06:53.200 --> 06:55.120
and you would still get down there and be like,

06:55.120 --> 06:57.680
what fucking stinks so much?

06:57.680 --> 06:59.920
Who is doing that with their body?

07:02.080 --> 07:04.800
Herbal Essences is still a company that's around, right?

07:04.800 --> 07:05.840
As far as I know, yes.

07:05.840 --> 07:06.340
Yeah.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.400
I don't know that-

07:08.400 --> 07:11.440
I guess you could wear one of those SARS masks.

07:11.440 --> 07:16.880
Could you wear an oversized, like, novelty clothes pin on your nose?

07:16.880 --> 07:22.640
And carry around a printed out, like, speech bubble on a stick that just says PU.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.960
Yeah, and maybe, like, some stink line stickers

07:24.960 --> 07:26.880
that you could stick on people who are smelly.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.880
And maybe you carry around a big jar of flies and you throw that on a person.

07:32.080 --> 07:32.320
Don't stick-

07:32.320 --> 07:33.520
Those really stink, Shamel.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.840
They probably don't have any control over it.

07:35.840 --> 07:41.600
Yeah, maybe you could walk around with, like, one of those giant, like,

07:43.200 --> 07:46.080
remember how Rick the Model Martel had a big-

07:46.880 --> 07:49.760
had his own cologne called Arrogance that he would spray on people?

07:50.400 --> 07:51.760
Maybe you could do that.

07:51.760 --> 07:52.000
Don't do that.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.040
That sucks.

07:53.040 --> 07:53.760
That's a bad-

07:53.760 --> 07:54.640
That's a bad look.

07:55.200 --> 08:00.160
I don't think it's a bad look as much as it is a look you could try and see if it fits you.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.560
The Rick the Model Martel classic.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.520
Just spray people down.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.040
Yeah.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.560
Get a six pack of BOD.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.760
So wear them across your chest like a bandolier.

08:11.760 --> 08:12.960
Yeah, like a bandolier.

08:12.960 --> 08:13.440
There we go.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.240
And then just, like, fast draw a BOD.

08:16.240 --> 08:21.200
Because what's great about BOD is it came in repurposed Windex bottles.

08:21.200 --> 08:25.200
And that nozzle, you can twist it and get a really long spray going on that.

08:25.840 --> 08:29.840
You can go with a cone of spray or you can go with a straight shot like a-

08:29.840 --> 08:30.720
Distinct.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.840
No scope.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.680
No scope. Distinct. BOD shot.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.480
Hold on.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.600
I just had a great idea.

08:36.160 --> 08:37.600
You want to do some BOD shots?

08:37.600 --> 08:37.840
Yes.

08:37.840 --> 08:38.240
What?

08:38.240 --> 08:43.520
Convention organizers have a complimentary Febreeze booth.

08:44.640 --> 08:48.480
How about a mandatory Febreeze booth?

08:48.480 --> 08:50.080
You have to perform-

08:50.080 --> 08:53.920
As they're walking in, you do, like, a security check and then a Febreeze check

08:54.640 --> 08:56.640
and then they get to enter the convention.

08:56.640 --> 09:03.600
You can only enter the convention center through the Febreeze way.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.520
It's like you have those misters at, like, amusement parks where it gets real hot

09:07.520 --> 09:08.480
and the kids play in it.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.800
You just have that, but it's Febreeze and BOD.

09:10.800 --> 09:20.880
On the twist, put this on the twist and decide that you enjoy or can find pleasurable

09:20.880 --> 09:22.240
the smell of body odor.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.600
Like a connoisseur?

09:23.600 --> 09:26.880
Maybe you remind yourself, like, this is human. This is distinctly human.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.720
This is it. This is the real shit.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.600
This is what humanity is supposed to smell like.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.880
This is what we smell like for ages.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.440
Get out of your ivory tower and come smell these bits.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.640
This is what we smelled like when we built the ivory tower initially

09:39.200 --> 09:40.960
and the Tower of Babel and shit.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.560
This is what Jesus smelled like.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.160
Probably.

09:44.160 --> 09:44.880
Basically.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.000
Homeboy didn't have BOD.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.600
No, though I would watch that commercial.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.880
He's probably like, hey, dad, like, can you invent BOD super early

09:52.880 --> 09:58.080
just so I can just sort of purge the scents a little bit?

09:58.080 --> 09:59.600
Have you smelled these 12 dudes?

09:59.600 --> 10:02.160
It's just me and 12 dudes rolling around the desert.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.440
We smell like dookie.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.200
We smell like total dookie, dad.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.240
How about some BOD?

10:06.880 --> 10:08.320
How about some BOD, God?

10:09.200 --> 10:10.240
God, invent BOD.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.520
God, BOD me.

10:11.520 --> 10:12.240
BOD me, God.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.480
I'm Boston Jesus.

10:19.520 --> 10:20.720
Boston J.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.880
Yo, it's your boy, Boston J.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.400
How about some BOD, God?

10:24.400 --> 10:25.120
Dad, damn.

10:25.680 --> 10:30.640
Scholars can't prove that Jesus was not from Boston.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.120
In fact, I believe the Dead Sea Scrolls,

10:35.120 --> 10:38.960
which had been ruled apocryphal and non-canonical,

10:39.520 --> 10:41.440
there's some pretty damning evidence in there.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.680
It says here Jesus spake,

10:43.680 --> 10:46.880
yo, Judas, I'm wicked disappointed in you.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.720
I'm wicked disappointed, brah.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.720
I'm gonna turn this water into chowder.

10:54.080 --> 10:54.580
Nomah.

10:56.480 --> 10:57.760
Y'all want a yahoo?

10:57.760 --> 10:58.960
Yeah, please.

10:58.960 --> 10:59.840
How about a yahoo?

11:00.960 --> 11:02.080
Sorry, Jesus.

11:02.080 --> 11:02.640
Sorry, Jesus.

11:03.440 --> 11:06.480
This yahoo was sent in by our close friend, Evan Minsker.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.040
Thanks, Evan.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.840
Getting married real soon.

11:09.840 --> 11:10.640
Very exciting time of his life.

11:10.640 --> 11:11.920
Everything's coming up, Evan.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.840
Evan wrote a great piece on Pitchfork,

11:13.840 --> 11:15.520
if you haven't read it recently,

11:15.520 --> 11:19.680
that is great about Mac DeMarco.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.040
Is that that cat's name?

11:21.040 --> 11:23.120
I'm old, so I don't really know what anybody's called,

11:23.120 --> 11:24.560
but I like the story.

11:26.080 --> 11:26.800
He's a great dude.

11:26.800 --> 11:27.280
Thank you, Evan.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.480
It's by yahooanswersuserjackf who asks,

11:31.520 --> 11:34.240
how do you get rid of an Arby's manager?

11:35.680 --> 11:38.560
Recently they moved around some of the managers

11:38.560 --> 11:40.960
and the one we got is mean and sloppy.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.960
She blames employees for things she did

11:42.960 --> 11:45.760
and treats us extremely memely bad.

11:45.760 --> 11:46.400
I saw-

11:46.400 --> 11:48.160
I was gonna say that word one more time.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.440
Extremely memely bad.

11:50.400 --> 11:53.040
I saw two of them about to cry today

11:53.840 --> 11:55.360
and she cuts ours.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.120
I hate to see my coworker upset

11:57.120 --> 11:59.440
and I would do anything to get her gone

11:59.440 --> 12:01.520
within the law preferably.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.920
Oh, and she cusses on the job,

12:03.920 --> 12:06.000
which is never allowed, especially by management.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.440
I'm glad that this person felt the need

12:09.440 --> 12:12.480
to specify within the law preferably.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.920
Yeah, preferably.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.160
I would prefer not to murder this lady.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.280
But I understand that that's my only recourse.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.360
Listen, if I had my druthers,

12:23.360 --> 12:24.800
I would not murder this woman.

12:26.240 --> 12:31.760
I think you are perfectly positioned right now

12:31.760 --> 12:38.880
for a broad conspiracy that will position

12:38.880 --> 12:41.440
not only the downfall of this manager,

12:41.440 --> 12:45.440
but you to rise up and take their place.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.160
You're jilted.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.080
That job should have been yours.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.320
So you need to start machinations,

12:50.320 --> 12:52.800
moving pieces around the board,

12:52.800 --> 12:57.200
lining up opponents, preparing them

12:57.200 --> 13:00.000
for a catastrophe to befall them,

13:00.000 --> 13:01.280
a political catastrophe, if you will,

13:02.560 --> 13:03.760
in the Arby's politics

13:03.760 --> 13:08.960
and preparing yourself to be the new district manager.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.320
That's right, gentlemen.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.320
I am suggesting the House of Carby's.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.120
It is very hard to make a house

13:17.120 --> 13:19.200
out of thinly sliced beefs.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.080
Let me throw this out.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.680
Let me throw this out as like a move,

13:21.680 --> 13:23.120
as one of your moves.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.080
You have the district management come down

13:26.080 --> 13:28.640
because you suspect something shady.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.040
You pop open her trunk and what's that?

13:31.040 --> 13:34.320
You've planted a bunch of raw beef in her trunk

13:34.320 --> 13:35.680
that she's been stealing.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.520
Beef thief, the classic beef thief.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.200
The classic beef thief gambit.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.000
And then maybe you have a sexy affair

13:42.000 --> 13:44.320
with an attractive aspiring journalist.

13:45.360 --> 13:45.680
Maybe.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.240
How does that help?

13:47.440 --> 13:48.480
How does it hurt?

13:48.480 --> 13:49.440
How does it hurt?

13:49.440 --> 13:50.320
Fair enough.

13:50.320 --> 13:50.720
She's gonna-

13:50.720 --> 13:51.680
And then you blow the lid off

13:51.680 --> 13:52.880
the curly fry conspiracy.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.800
She's gonna think she's using you

13:54.800 --> 13:56.320
to get Arby's connections,

13:56.320 --> 14:00.560
but really you're using her for Arby's leverage.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.160
And when you are,

14:02.160 --> 14:03.600
listen, in the game of Arby's,

14:03.600 --> 14:05.120
you win or you die.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.400
Or you eat curly fries.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.280
Or you eat curly fries.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.960
Well, you're gonna do that either way.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.520
Okay, so you either win and eat curly fries

14:11.520 --> 14:13.360
or eat curly fries and then die.

14:13.360 --> 14:13.600
Right.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.840
Well, you couldn't die and then eat curly fries, Griffin.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.040
That's fucking ridiculous.

14:17.040 --> 14:17.840
That's a good point.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.000
How would you chew your dad

14:20.000 --> 14:21.120
unless we're looking at a weekend

14:21.120 --> 14:22.400
at Bernie's two situation?

14:24.800 --> 14:27.120
I'm saying that curly fries

14:27.120 --> 14:29.920
possess an ambrosial quantity

14:30.720 --> 14:33.280
that can restore life to the dead.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.400
Well, that's just science.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.360
They're that fucking good.

14:35.360 --> 14:40.080
I'm mixing my Game of Thrones

14:40.080 --> 14:41.360
and my House of Cards metaphors.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.720
They're basically the same show.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.280
Give Kevin Spacey a sword and a beard

14:45.840 --> 14:48.400
and it's basically Game of Thrones.

14:51.840 --> 14:52.720
It's gonna be a tough-

14:52.720 --> 14:55.200
Could you trick her into saying she quits?

14:55.760 --> 14:56.880
Because once she says it,

14:56.880 --> 14:59.760
that's like she's locked into it.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.280
So you just need to get her to be like,

15:01.280 --> 15:02.960
what would you say instead of like,

15:02.960 --> 15:04.960
I hire her to be like, I quit?

15:04.960 --> 15:05.920
Bam!

15:05.920 --> 15:07.040
Bam, got it.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.280
The golden contract appears from there.

15:10.800 --> 15:14.640
A levitating ink-dipped quill signs.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.960
Maybe you could get her to admit

15:16.960 --> 15:19.520
that she doesn't really like Arby's food.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.240
Oh my God.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.680
Like you go to her and you're like,

15:21.680 --> 15:22.240
this is good,

15:22.240 --> 15:23.760
but wouldn't you rather be like

15:23.760 --> 15:27.760
eating a porterhouse steak or like corn chowder?

15:27.760 --> 15:28.960
Do you think this is better?

15:28.960 --> 15:30.080
She's not gonna fall for that.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.560
She's gonna be like, take that filet mignon

15:32.560 --> 15:33.680
and then slice it really thin

15:33.680 --> 15:34.800
and put it on some shitty bread

15:34.800 --> 15:35.760
and maybe we'll talk.

15:35.760 --> 15:36.720
Like, God damn it.

15:36.720 --> 15:37.600
If you can though,

15:37.600 --> 15:41.520
what if RJ Arby's is like hiding around the corner

15:41.520 --> 15:43.040
and he comes out and he's like,

15:43.040 --> 15:44.000
I knew it, Susan.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.200
I never trusted you.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.120
You betrayed me, Susan.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.040
And you broke my heart.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.880
You broke my heart, Susan.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.240
You're the one, Susan.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.800
I was gonna call it Susan's.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.160
I swear to God.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.560
The next burger was gonna be called the Big Susan.

16:02.560 --> 16:03.760
We've never had burgers.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.560
I was gonna start making burgers apparently.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.800
For you, for you, Susan.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.120
Because I knew you loved them, Susan.

16:11.120 --> 16:11.680
I was gonna make-

16:11.680 --> 16:13.440
I can see it in your employee review

16:13.440 --> 16:15.280
that you thought we could start making burgers

16:15.280 --> 16:16.640
and I said for you or anything.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.520
I was gonna make you the forbidden sandwich.

16:20.960 --> 16:21.460
I was gonna-

16:22.400 --> 16:23.440
Roast beef on top,

16:23.440 --> 16:24.480
roast beef on bottom,

16:24.480 --> 16:25.840
and bread in the middle.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.920
I was gonna do that for you, Susan.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.840
You broke my heart, Susan.

16:31.840 --> 16:36.000
And you're the whole reason I made the potato wedges

16:36.000 --> 16:36.960
in the first place.

16:36.960 --> 16:41.120
And that was the day RJ Arby's shut down all the Arby's.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.160
No one goes in, no one goes out.

16:45.760 --> 16:48.560
But somehow you can still buy the sandwiches.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.040
Someone's still making the sandwiches.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.040
The smell is impossible.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.160
Do you think RJ Arby's lives in fear of the moment

16:56.160 --> 16:58.640
that Subway figures out like,

16:59.840 --> 17:01.120
what if we just made our roast beef?

17:01.120 --> 17:02.080
Oh, thin beef, okay.

17:02.080 --> 17:02.800
Yeah, we did that.

17:02.800 --> 17:03.920
Oops, Arby's is gone.

17:04.960 --> 17:05.520
That easy.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.800
Arby's used to have a sandwich

17:09.440 --> 17:12.640
that was a croissant sandwich with roast beef on it.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.120
Oh boy.

17:13.120 --> 17:16.960
And they haven't had it for probably 25 years

17:16.960 --> 17:19.040
and I think about it three times a day.

17:20.320 --> 17:22.480
If you're looking for some insight

17:22.480 --> 17:24.240
into like Justin McElroy, the man,

17:25.120 --> 17:27.280
that's why I'm at where I'm at.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.200
That's what I'm usually thinking about.

17:29.200 --> 17:32.080
Justin either thinks about the forbidden Arby's sandwich

17:32.080 --> 17:34.000
or how good Tastations were.

17:36.000 --> 17:36.880
That's basically-

17:36.880 --> 17:38.800
Tastations were good, Griffin.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.400
It's funny you say that because they were delicious.

17:44.080 --> 17:47.360
Also, my favorite cereal ever was Crunch Berries.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.760
Those Papa Smurf Berries.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.040
Oops, all berries?

17:51.040 --> 17:53.760
No, Papa Smurf Berries, it tastes completely different.

17:53.760 --> 17:54.800
They're the best cereal ever

17:54.800 --> 17:59.680
and they were only around for like a day and I-

17:59.680 --> 18:00.720
Much like Brigadoon.

18:01.280 --> 18:06.720
I have spent the 25 years since their release

18:06.720 --> 18:10.080
and discontinuation searching for a cereal

18:10.080 --> 18:12.000
that has the same flavor as that,

18:12.000 --> 18:16.240
hoping with every bowl will be the bowl back to-

18:16.240 --> 18:17.120
Be the bowl home.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.560
Will be the bowl back to-

18:18.560 --> 18:20.080
Man, Rachel and I finished that.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.240
We watched the series finale.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.000
That is a rough ending on that.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.200
That is a tough-

18:25.200 --> 18:26.320
No spoilers.

18:26.320 --> 18:27.360
Tough cookie.

18:27.360 --> 18:30.160
It resolves his entire shit

18:30.160 --> 18:33.120
with like a single line of text at the end.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.680
Like, oh, and this is how he turned out.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.120
Thanks, Quantum Leap.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.440
Could have used maybe a bit more expo.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.160
A little more expo on that.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.760
If they thought they were gonna get another season.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.800
If they thought that they had another season in them

18:44.800 --> 18:45.520
because it's weird.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.080
Doesn't it end with like a sabbatical basically?

18:48.080 --> 18:50.000
Like he's just gonna chill on the leaping?

18:51.360 --> 18:52.560
I mean, it hints at that.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.080
You know what it needs?

18:54.080 --> 18:56.720
And we're talking on the wrong podcast about this.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.600
How fucking good would a Telltale adventure game

18:59.600 --> 19:00.960
of Quantum Leap be?

19:00.960 --> 19:01.600
I'm serious.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.400
Walking dead.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.360
It'd be amazing.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.200
It'd be absolutely phenomenal.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.600
I would buy a game system just to play that.

19:07.600 --> 19:07.840
Right.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.520
I don't know if those dudes are listening,

19:09.520 --> 19:10.400
but call me.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.600
I will write the entire thing.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.120
I have fan fiction.

19:13.120 --> 19:13.840
That is not a joke.

19:13.840 --> 19:14.560
Ready to go.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.160
Anyway, I got another question for you guys.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.520
What's the appropriate time or distance

19:17.520 --> 19:20.800
one should hold the door open for the next person behind them?

19:20.800 --> 19:23.360
I don't want to slam the door in the person behind me,

19:23.360 --> 19:26.480
but I also don't want to stand there staring at them

19:26.480 --> 19:27.840
for a full minute.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.600
Is it different for men and women?

19:29.600 --> 19:30.560
That's from Desmond.

19:33.040 --> 19:33.840
I tend to hold it.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.680
See, I don't really subscribe to the gender side of this.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.480
I tend to hold the door open for everybody

19:40.480 --> 19:43.920
as do like everybody in Huntington.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.120
Or at least in the area that I live.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.520
There are probably many areas where that is the case,

19:49.520 --> 19:50.560
especially in the South.

19:50.560 --> 19:55.280
My delineation on distance is age-based, not gender-based.

19:55.280 --> 19:55.760
I agree.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.360
If it's an old person, I will hold it open so much longer.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.600
Keep it open for like a full country mile.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.000
Yeah, absolutely.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.560
I think a big part of this too is,

20:06.560 --> 20:08.640
and this is something that I've kind of learned the hard way,

20:08.640 --> 20:11.920
is if you're going to push on through,

20:11.920 --> 20:14.240
if you're going to go through and not hold the door,

20:14.960 --> 20:18.160
it's essential that you not have made eye contact.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.720
But you have to have plausible deniability.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.000
The person behind you, if you look at them and they see you

20:24.000 --> 20:27.200
and you see them, then you know they're coming.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.120
And at that point, if you don't hold the door open for them,

20:29.120 --> 20:30.960
then it's on you.

20:30.960 --> 20:35.600
Also, if it is a double action door that swings both in and out

20:35.600 --> 20:38.560
and you let go of it, it's like 50% chance

20:38.560 --> 20:40.800
it's going to swing back and smack that person in the face.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.280
And if it does, there's a 10% chance they'll die.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.000
Yeah.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.840
So just think about that hot shot.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.440
Think about that murderer.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.320
It's hard when there's a huge group of people.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.800
I think that you don't want to fall into that trap.

20:52.800 --> 20:53.920
You got to be careful about that.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.080
Because if there's like 50 people exiting a place,

20:56.080 --> 20:57.440
that could be your whole day.

20:57.440 --> 21:00.080
I remember getting pinned down when church let out

21:00.080 --> 21:01.840
when we were little and I pulled the door open

21:01.840 --> 21:04.880
and it was just like, suddenly just a line of people.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.880
And it's like, I just want to, can I, I need to go.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.360
Guess what?

21:07.360 --> 21:09.760
They're all 99 years old too.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.360
You can't like, get it yourself.

21:12.400 --> 21:12.720
Can't.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.760
You know, my favorite door holding experience

21:15.760 --> 21:17.920
is when, you know, those airlock kind of doors

21:17.920 --> 21:19.680
where there's like two sets of doors.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.480
And so one person holds the door open for you

21:22.480 --> 21:24.480
and then you hold the door open for them.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.080
It always makes you feel like we're about to start

21:26.080 --> 21:29.280
like a Fred Astaire-esque kind of dance routine.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.040
Like door holding.

21:32.320 --> 21:35.040
Or if there's like 199 year olds

21:35.040 --> 21:37.520
and they're all coming towards the doors

21:37.520 --> 21:41.200
and then you're the only person with door holding capacity.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.800
And so you have to like,

21:42.800 --> 21:45.600
cliffhanger sandwich yourself between these two doors

21:45.600 --> 21:48.480
in a way that you can keep them both open at the same time.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.160
Like you take your fucking shoes off

21:50.160 --> 21:51.600
and like tuck them under the doors.

21:51.600 --> 21:52.720
Like, no, it's cool.

21:52.720 --> 21:53.600
I didn't need those anyway.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.000
You guys are going to take like five years

21:56.000 --> 21:57.280
to get through both of these doors.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.040
So I'm just going to leave those shoes there.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.360
They're the church's shoes now.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.880
You know, one thing I've, is interesting.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.520
I've discovered with, that my wife Sydney does not,

22:07.520 --> 22:09.600
and it took me a long time to get this.

22:09.600 --> 22:13.040
She does not like me to hold the door open for her.

22:13.040 --> 22:17.040
She wants me to, I don't know

22:17.040 --> 22:19.360
what biological impulse is driving this,

22:19.360 --> 22:21.120
but she wants me to go in first.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.760
I don't know if she's expecting an assailant.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.720
And I scout around and you come back and tell her it's safe.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.160
She wants me to go in first.

22:28.720 --> 22:29.600
For what reason?

22:29.600 --> 22:30.320
Like, I don't know.

22:31.280 --> 22:34.480
Hello, I'm the envoy to the Grand Sydney Empire.

22:34.480 --> 22:39.280
Presenting the lady ship, Sydney of McElroy.

22:39.280 --> 22:43.520
Does she make you carry around a little tin horn?

22:43.520 --> 22:45.280
I'm not saying, I'm not saying shit.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.960
You guys are paying for this next Christmas

22:46.960 --> 22:49.680
and I'm not fucking, I'm not going to withstand that.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.040
Listen, I'm not knocking it.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.160
She can get you to do that.

22:52.160 --> 22:53.680
I think that's the dopest shit.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.080
We used to actually, we were in college

22:56.880 --> 22:58.320
and we would go through a double door.

22:58.320 --> 23:01.120
We would also, we would, there were at least three of us there.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.640
We would say, okay, who's the man?

23:02.640 --> 23:04.880
And we would pick who would get to be the man.

23:04.880 --> 23:08.080
And then the other two would open the door for that guy.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.840
And that guy would walk in really cool.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.760
Because everybody would be like, who is that guy?

23:11.760 --> 23:15.520
Can you tell me what your really cool walk involved, Justin?

23:16.480 --> 23:19.040
Yeah, a little green bag in your head.

23:19.040 --> 23:20.000
That's essential.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.480
And kind of like a strut shake shimmy.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.040
Can you even strut while you're wearing cargo shorts?

23:25.040 --> 23:25.680
Or is that?

23:26.560 --> 23:28.320
It's more of a switch, to be honest.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.200
Who is that guy?

23:29.200 --> 23:31.920
Oh, he's the heir to the cargo short fortune, clearly.

23:32.880 --> 23:35.200
He's the son of the man who invented cargo shorts.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.040
He's Jimmy Buffet's son.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.120
Did Jimmy Buffet?

23:39.120 --> 23:41.360
Did James Buffet involve cargo shorts?

23:41.360 --> 23:44.480
I'm pretty sure that would be his defacto wardrobe, right?

23:46.400 --> 23:48.160
I listened to Jimmy Buffet.

23:48.160 --> 23:48.640
Don't.

23:48.640 --> 23:49.600
By myself.

23:49.600 --> 23:50.240
Didn't.

23:50.240 --> 23:50.880
And wept.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.240
Sometimes you need a little bit of that beachy vibe.

23:56.240 --> 23:59.600
So there's Radio Margaritaville on the Sirius XM.

23:59.600 --> 24:04.320
Now, normally when I need an emotional lift, I'll turn to 40s on 4.

24:04.320 --> 24:09.760
But 40s on 4 has been replaced by an all fucking Billy Joel station.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.720
That's like not getting it for me.

24:12.720 --> 24:13.520
Is it still called 40s on 4?

24:13.520 --> 24:15.040
Is it called Piano Mandate?

24:15.040 --> 24:16.560
No, now it's called Billy on-

24:16.560 --> 24:17.520
Joel Jams.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.480
Joel Jams.

24:18.480 --> 24:19.600
A Billy Joel joint.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.160
And so I'm listening to Margaritaville.

24:22.160 --> 24:25.920
I listened to the entirety of the song Off to See the Lizard

24:25.920 --> 24:31.600
while driving by myself at 8 30 at night to pick up a pizza bread from Geno's.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.080
Oh my God.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.320
And I needed that beachy vibe right then.

24:34.320 --> 24:35.920
James is there for you with that.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.920
Jimmy's got your back on that front.

24:37.920 --> 24:43.360
If you need to like just escape the incredible sadness of the act you are participating in.

24:43.360 --> 24:46.800
Does the Billy Joel radio station come with an in-car breathalyzer

24:48.960 --> 24:50.320
that you have to blow into?

24:50.320 --> 24:52.640
But it'll only play if you are drunk driving.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.000
You have to blow-

24:54.000 --> 24:54.640
Come on, my man.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.000
Let Billy Joel handle this for you.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.720
Billy Joel has become kind of an expert of what you're doing.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.400
Come on, Billy's got-

25:02.400 --> 25:03.600
I can talk you down.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.400
I can talk you down.

25:04.400 --> 25:07.040
This place sings from Italian restaurant.

25:07.040 --> 25:09.200
Can you get one turn left up here?

25:10.400 --> 25:15.760
I am the father of five girls, the oldest, which is 13, and begun to take an interest in boys.

25:16.320 --> 25:22.320
As such, I'm left in the position that fathers have been left in for the last 23.6 years.

25:22.320 --> 25:26.560
How does one balance the instinctual desire to crush these little hormone filled

25:26.560 --> 25:30.080
balls of lust and desire to be a cool dad?

25:30.080 --> 25:31.120
GoldenEye tournaments?

25:31.840 --> 25:34.000
Playing a game, a little catcheroo?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.760
Working on a car together?

25:35.760 --> 25:39.440
Or should I just accept the natural order of things and hunt this little bugger down

25:39.440 --> 25:40.800
Terminator style?

25:40.800 --> 25:43.680
That's from hormonally hijacked California.

25:47.280 --> 25:53.760
Man, I do not envy your position, my dude.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.080
I have got what-

25:56.080 --> 25:58.320
I mean, I've got a daughter on the way.

25:58.320 --> 26:05.680
And the best plan I've been able to cook up is to raise her to be sort of like just a sexless

26:05.680 --> 26:14.880
locust of emotion that loves science and loves research and loves supporting her parents with

26:14.880 --> 26:21.360
money and just cannot in any way, shape, or form have romantic love.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.560
Would that be a failure as a parent?

26:24.560 --> 26:25.040
I assume so.

26:25.040 --> 26:29.200
So like she doesn't understand romantic love or she simply does not desire it.

26:29.840 --> 26:34.080
In a way that colorblind person cannot tell the difference between red and green, she

26:34.080 --> 26:36.240
cannot distinguish love from other emotions.

26:36.240 --> 26:37.920
Just does not have the receptors for-

26:37.920 --> 26:38.960
Are you angry at me?

26:38.960 --> 26:40.880
Why are you moving your face towards my face?

26:42.080 --> 26:43.040
Is this-

26:43.040 --> 26:44.160
I don't understand this.

26:46.160 --> 26:51.120
I feel like I lean towards the natural order of things argument here because I feel like-

26:51.120 --> 26:56.640
I don't know, I feel like it's a position that, like natural selection, it must be that

26:56.640 --> 27:00.000
we behave that way for it is the way to continue the spe-

27:00.000 --> 27:00.400
Right?

27:00.400 --> 27:05.760
Like you have to be the dad who's like, now you be respectful of my daughter, honey.

27:05.760 --> 27:08.560
I don't want you dating until you're out of the house, blah, blah, blah.

27:08.560 --> 27:13.040
Because otherwise you're like, I don't fucking care, whatever.

27:13.040 --> 27:17.040
I don't understand, like dudes are the worst.

27:17.040 --> 27:22.560
And little dudes don't even have that, like, they don't even realize they're the worst yet.

27:23.440 --> 27:28.400
And so they will just like wedge their dick between a mattress and box spring and like

27:28.400 --> 27:31.600
not understand why they're doing that.

27:32.800 --> 27:33.360
And that-

27:33.360 --> 27:35.440
I don't understand why they're doing that.

27:35.440 --> 27:42.320
That's what, cause it's just any crevice with surrounding pressure.

27:42.320 --> 27:45.120
They're like, I'm gonna get, I'm gonna just put my dick right in there.

27:45.120 --> 27:47.040
Let me throw this out.

27:47.040 --> 27:53.200
That's what he's up against though, he's up against like basically feral little jizz slugs.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.520
Like I've called them that before and that's what they are.

27:55.520 --> 28:03.360
So here's my advice, rather than trying to combat these awful, awful human beings that

28:03.360 --> 28:09.520
are 13 year old boys, you need to like train and raise your daughter to be so incredibly

28:09.520 --> 28:15.440
self-sufficient and wise and smart that she sees their bullshit coming a mile away.

28:16.640 --> 28:18.960
Raise a powerful woman who's respectful of herself and who-

28:18.960 --> 28:22.400
But then they invent new bullshit, they're the fucking, I'm telling you-

28:22.400 --> 28:25.680
Well that's the arms race that is hormonal 13 year olds.

28:25.680 --> 28:31.120
But I'm saying right now we need to create like a stronger bulletproof vest, if you will.

28:31.120 --> 28:35.120
So then they'll come up with, you know, their armor piercing rounds or whatever.

28:35.120 --> 28:39.920
Travis, future dad Justin is on board with you.

28:39.920 --> 28:46.320
13 year old Justin would like to just heartily thank you for making girls more complicated.

28:46.320 --> 28:50.480
Because like I was nailing it constantly, so I'm really glad.

28:50.480 --> 28:53.200
What I really need was an increase in the difficulty curve there, Travis.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.320
So I thank you for that.

28:54.320 --> 29:00.480
But I don't think, I don't like, I don't think either party in this arrangement knows what

29:00.480 --> 29:01.680
the fuck they're doing.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.440
No, absolutely not, right?

29:03.440 --> 29:06.880
Do you mean the dad and the 13 year old boy or the girl?

29:06.880 --> 29:08.480
I'm talking about 13 year old boys and girls.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.240
Like I just don't think there's any, I don't, man, I don't know.

29:12.240 --> 29:17.760
I didn't like, I didn't like date or whatever until I was like a freshman in high school.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.600
I didn't like speak to other human beings.

29:20.320 --> 29:21.120
I don't understand.

29:22.320 --> 29:30.400
Like there's a pretty rough patch there between I would say 11 and 14 where you are just fucking

29:30.960 --> 29:32.400
just going with it.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.160
Just going with the flow.

29:34.160 --> 29:40.240
And then like at 15 it's still a little foggy, but you at least understand that it's foggy.

29:40.240 --> 29:46.000
I don't, I just, I don't think like dating at 13 is like, that's crazy town to me.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.800
I mean, it's like, I'm not here to-

29:48.800 --> 29:51.120
That's like snowboarding at 110.

29:51.120 --> 29:53.680
It's like, that's not an appropriate age to do that.

29:53.680 --> 29:54.080
I don't know, man.

29:54.080 --> 29:58.640
I can't imagine any, like any judgment I'm going to pass here that's not going to come

29:58.640 --> 30:00.000
back to bite me on the ass.

30:00.000 --> 30:08.000
Like all I can say is, and this is a guess, a hypothesis, is that the reason this is stressful

30:08.000 --> 30:16.880
for you is that it is sort of the beginning of the end of your like training period for

30:16.880 --> 30:23.120
this human you've created and the beginning of the process of them, you know, leaving

30:23.120 --> 30:25.440
that training period to become their own person.

30:25.440 --> 30:30.080
And I think it's scary right now because you've been in sort of a dry tech period for them

30:30.080 --> 30:33.840
as a human where they don't have as many things that they really have to deal with that you

30:33.840 --> 30:34.720
can't help them with.

30:34.720 --> 30:39.600
And this is the start where they're going to be tested on the training that you've provided

30:39.600 --> 30:41.040
them up until this point.

30:41.040 --> 30:45.600
And I think you just, the fact that you're like super concerned and on point, you're

30:45.600 --> 30:48.880
already ahead of the game, like in the, in the grand scheme of things.

30:48.880 --> 30:54.160
I think you need to have faith that you have raised a quality human who's going to be able

30:54.160 --> 30:54.960
to deal with this stuff.

30:54.960 --> 31:02.160
But like this first test that they do out the gate is the fucking gom jabbar of humanity.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.320
Like this is the fucking worst.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.440
But let me throw this out.

31:05.440 --> 31:08.640
Here's, here's, here's the real issue here, if I may.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.560
It's not the question you asked, but it's what I'm going to answer.

31:11.920 --> 31:14.320
About being like that dad, arms crossed.

31:14.320 --> 31:15.520
I don't want you to do that.

31:16.240 --> 31:19.520
My only fear with that would be that you're creating an environment in which your daughter

31:19.520 --> 31:24.160
would be afraid to come to you and ask for advice and ask questions and speak to you

31:24.160 --> 31:28.720
in an honest, open way, because you're this grumbly, angry about the fact that she likes

31:28.720 --> 31:29.600
boys kind of thing.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.120
That's not a bad point, Travis.

31:31.120 --> 31:31.360
Yeah.

31:31.360 --> 31:35.920
Whereas what you really need to be is the guy who's open and is willing to talk to her

31:35.920 --> 31:39.040
about things and not just shut down like, well, you shouldn't even be dating.

31:39.040 --> 31:42.800
You should create an environment in which she is feel safe and comfortable talking to

31:42.800 --> 31:46.720
you because you are still the best source of advice and information she's got.

31:46.720 --> 31:53.440
If someone knows that they have your love and your trust, that's always going to be

31:53.440 --> 31:57.680
more powerful than knowing that they're risking your judgment, because otherwise they're

31:57.680 --> 31:59.440
just going to see how much they can get away with.

31:59.440 --> 32:02.880
The other one, it's like it's the next best thing to be in there.

32:03.680 --> 32:04.320
Yeah.

32:04.320 --> 32:09.520
Or you could do like we did and take them to church camp, because that worked pretty

32:09.520 --> 32:10.240
good for me.

32:10.240 --> 32:11.520
For a good long walk.

32:11.520 --> 32:16.080
I mean, there was a lot of, obviously we weren't a party to this, but there was a lot of fingering

32:16.080 --> 32:16.960
going on at church camp.

32:16.960 --> 32:24.320
There was like a lot of fingering going on.

32:24.320 --> 32:27.280
To hear the rumors, there weren't a dry shorts in the house.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.560
Let's put it that way.

32:28.560 --> 32:29.760
There was a lot of it going on.

32:29.760 --> 32:30.560
I didn't see it.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.040
Listen, I didn't see it.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.160
I didn't see shit.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.360
I obviously didn't take part in it.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.720
Put my finger where?

32:40.080 --> 32:40.880
Excuse me.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.120
But you know that shit was going on.

32:43.760 --> 32:44.640
Pools closed.

32:44.640 --> 32:45.520
What are you doing?

32:45.520 --> 32:46.020
Fingering.

32:47.680 --> 32:48.960
What are you doing here at the pool?

32:48.960 --> 32:49.520
It's closed.

32:49.520 --> 32:51.120
Oh, fingering.

32:51.120 --> 32:51.680
Okay, cool.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.180
Bye.

33:07.760 --> 33:09.040
Kill an Arby's manager.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.640
Kill an Arby's manager just to watch him.

33:11.200 --> 33:11.600
What?

33:11.600 --> 33:12.240
No.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.440
This podcast will self-destruct because we don't want to be implicated.

33:15.440 --> 33:16.080
Here's your mission.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.440
Get fit by summer.

33:17.440 --> 33:18.240
What's the problem?

33:18.240 --> 33:19.520
That vending machine at work.

33:19.520 --> 33:20.640
I know you love it.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.120
What's your guys like vending machine thing?

33:23.120 --> 33:27.360
Because I have sometimes I'll just get dirty with like a honey bun.

33:27.360 --> 33:27.920
Something like that.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.840
Honey don't have us a vending machine.

33:29.840 --> 33:35.520
But God fucking when they had those like the Nutty Buddies, like the wafer, chocolate,

33:35.520 --> 33:36.640
peanut butter deals.

33:36.640 --> 33:37.360
Oh, man.

33:37.360 --> 33:38.720
I used to cream a honey button.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.800
Honey button and then I'd be like, it's a breakfast.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.480
It's not a lot of breakfast.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.000
It is a little Debbie, my man.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.120
Here's what I'm saying to you.

You guys, I saw you the other day through your windows in the two different states you live

35:11.200 --> 35:12.880
and watching Hulu on your computer.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.080
Sounds right.

35:14.080 --> 35:16.080
Saw you do some other shit on the computer too.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.200
I'm very disappointed in.

35:18.000 --> 35:18.960
That was research.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.720
Yeah, it was research, sure.

35:21.440 --> 35:22.800
For a book I'm writing.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.400
About butts.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.840
About butts.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.600
Butts through the ages.

35:27.600 --> 35:30.000
If you like that Hulu, let me tell you about Hulu Plus.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.160
Because it's better than regular Hulu.

35:32.160 --> 35:36.960
With Hulu Plus you can watch current season episodes of your favorite shows

35:36.960 --> 35:41.120
like Family Guy, Parks and Recreation.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.400
Both in one.

35:42.400 --> 35:42.960
Both in one.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.400
It's two shows in one.

35:44.400 --> 35:48.560
And The Tonight Show with new host Jimmy Fallon.

35:48.560 --> 35:49.360
Jimmy Fallon.

35:49.360 --> 35:50.480
James Fallon.

35:50.480 --> 35:50.960
James Fallon.

35:50.960 --> 35:51.680

35:51.680 --> 35:52.640

And you can watch that on all kinds of different devices.

36:06.480 --> 36:07.440
Tablets.

36:07.440 --> 36:08.000
Computer.

36:09.280 --> 36:10.080
Smart TV.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.200
Your Roku.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.720
I mean Six in Japanese.

36:12.720 --> 36:14.160
I bet you guys didn't know that.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.560
I've been trying to get people onto Hannibal.

36:16.560 --> 36:18.320
And you can watch this whole season.

36:18.320 --> 36:18.960
It's a great show.

36:18.960 --> 36:20.320
I was telling Travis about it before.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.600
You can go to HuluPlus.com.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.640
You can get Hulu Plus.

36:22.640 --> 36:23.680
Watch the whole season.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.400
This has been going on catch all the way up.

36:26.400 --> 36:29.280
You also get originals that you can't get access to anywhere else.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.560
There's a new show, Deadbeat.

36:31.120 --> 36:34.960
It's a comedy about a pot-spoking guy who talks to ghosts.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.240
So there might be some legal ramifications there.

36:38.240 --> 36:40.240
That'll be there.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.080
We'll have to talk to them about that.

36:42.080 --> 36:42.800
How can I get this?

36:43.840 --> 36:45.120
I want it for free, Griffin.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.240
I want it for free.

36:48.000 --> 36:48.800
Well, bad news.

36:48.800 --> 36:49.280
You can't.

36:49.280 --> 36:49.840
Just kidding.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.040
You totally can.

36:51.040 --> 36:51.920
Did you like my joke?

36:52.480 --> 36:54.160
Because for the first two-

36:54.160 --> 36:57.280
We can get you two weeks free here at my Bim Bam Co.

36:57.280 --> 37:00.240
All you got to do is go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

37:00.240 --> 37:00.800
All one word.

37:01.760 --> 37:05.280
And we'll get you two weeks full access of all that programming.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.440
And after that, it's only $7.99 a month.

37:07.440 --> 37:10.960
Theresa and I got rid of cable and now we just watch stuff on Hulu.

37:10.960 --> 37:13.440
We wait a day for $7.99.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.240
It's such a good deal.

37:14.240 --> 37:17.120
I have not had cable since Jesus.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.280
God, I honestly can't remember since Jesus.

37:21.280 --> 37:21.840
Yep.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.560
Since Boston Jesus walked the face of the earth.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.760
What are you watching?

37:25.760 --> 37:28.640
Project Runway, huh?

37:28.640 --> 37:30.880
You could be out extolling my name or whatever.

37:30.880 --> 37:31.760
That's fine.

37:31.760 --> 37:32.960
Yeah, it's fine.

37:32.960 --> 37:33.760
It's a good show.

37:33.760 --> 37:34.560
Love that Tim Gunn.

37:36.560 --> 37:40.160
HuluPlus.com slash my brother is where you can go to do that.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.400
And watch it and get it.

37:43.200 --> 37:43.920
Because, yeah.

37:45.280 --> 37:47.200
This next message is for-

37:47.200 --> 37:49.120
You know what's funny about Hulu Plus?

37:49.920 --> 37:52.640
They have been advertising with us for months.

37:52.640 --> 37:58.160
So, I know that they're continuing to see a return on that directly because we have a special URL.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.880
It's hot catchphrases like, so yeah.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.840
So, but here's the thing.

38:04.400 --> 38:10.080
There are people the 12th time we tell them to get Hulu Plus, they're like, fine.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.280
You warm me down.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.680
Fine, fine, fine.

38:13.680 --> 38:17.040
Maybe this is your time to finally commit your life to Hulu Plus.

38:17.040 --> 38:19.600
Anyway, we got some personal messages too.

38:19.600 --> 38:22.240
This message is for Adam Ford and it's from Chelsea Kerr.

38:23.280 --> 38:24.880
Hey girl, happy birthday.

38:24.880 --> 38:29.520
It's your 27th rotation around the sun and providing I sent this in on time for your special day-

38:29.520 --> 38:30.000
Probably not.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.600
I'll say- Yep.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.680
I'll say belated happy birthday as well.

38:33.680 --> 38:36.080
I love you as much as you should love a horse.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.280
Love, Chelsea.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.120
P.S. You are a butt.

38:39.120 --> 38:41.680
Now that last part isn't from Chelsea.

38:41.680 --> 38:44.240
That's just Travis putting you on blast.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.320
Hey Adam, you're a fucking butt.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.160
You're a butt, sir.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.160
You're a butt, sir.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.040
Look at yourself.

38:51.040 --> 38:52.400
Look at yourself in the mirror.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.000
You're a butt in clothes.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.280
This level of love that you described does not exist.

38:57.280 --> 38:59.280
This inter-human love that you described.

38:59.280 --> 39:02.960
I mean, it's admirable and I'm sure that you do love this guy a lot, but-

39:04.000 --> 39:05.280
As much as you love a horse.

39:05.280 --> 39:06.640
It's a great thing to aspire to.

39:07.520 --> 39:08.960
Yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.480
I hung out with a horse yesterday.

39:10.480 --> 39:11.360
Name was Pop Tart.

39:12.160 --> 39:13.280
Oh wow.

39:13.280 --> 39:14.720
Hanging out with a horse and went out to a ranch.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.000
There was a horse and two donks.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.480
Pretty much the best Saturday anyone's ever had.

39:18.480 --> 39:21.440
That's so weird, because horse and two donks is what I call my bits.

39:21.440 --> 39:24.160
Oh, Travis got driven.

39:24.160 --> 39:25.360
Sorry to get blue, everybody.

39:25.360 --> 39:26.000
I'm sorry.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.040
Theresa asked me the other day.

39:27.040 --> 39:29.360
She said, you guys talk about horses a lot on your podcast.

39:29.360 --> 39:32.560
Has any of you ever actually wanted to own a horse?

39:33.200 --> 39:34.080
I would own Pop Tart.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.120
Pop Tart is like real chill.

39:37.120 --> 39:41.360
Kind of an older horse, which is not ideal for prancing.

39:41.360 --> 39:46.080
But it just hung its head over the fence and just let me pet on it.

39:46.080 --> 39:46.960
And it was so soft.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.560
I almost went in and gave him a little kiss.

39:48.560 --> 39:49.920
And I was like, I'm at a party.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.080
I'm at a party.

39:52.080 --> 39:52.800
You're feeble about it.

39:52.800 --> 39:56.000
I said, my horse, I shouldn't give Pop Tart a sweet kiss on the nose.

39:57.280 --> 39:58.160
But I almost did.

39:58.160 --> 40:00.080
I started to lean in like, oh, here he comes.

40:00.080 --> 40:03.120
But then I was like, the owner might be watching, and that's not a good look.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.960
I almost gave this horse a sweet kiss at a party.

40:06.960 --> 40:11.680
Oh, Victoria, the one with the glasses out there.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.200
Did you invite the horse kisser?

40:13.200 --> 40:16.560
Did he just kiss Pop Tart on the mouth?

40:16.560 --> 40:19.760
It was one of Rachel's co-workers too.

40:19.760 --> 40:25.280
So the ramifications for her in the workplace environment would be everlasting.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.040
Yeah, your husband was really great.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.160
He did kiss Pop Tart.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.200
Pop Tart's still talking about him though.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.360
Pop Tart's a hit with Pop Tart.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.640
You married him, huh?

40:36.640 --> 40:38.480
You married that guy, huh?

40:38.480 --> 40:39.920
Horse smoocher, huh?

40:39.920 --> 40:44.480
David Early got a message for you from Gabe and Josh, and this is how they started.

40:44.480 --> 40:49.760
David Early, you thought this would be from your friends, Josh and Gabe, but it's me, Dio.

40:51.440 --> 40:52.960
I'll do my Dio voice.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.000
Happy birthday.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.800
You're a gentleman, a scholar, and a worthy opponent.

40:56.800 --> 41:01.440
But your attempts to hide your warrior cat, NBNBA, and fanfics were useless.

41:01.440 --> 41:02.800
You've been defeated.

41:02.800 --> 41:08.400
But remember this as your best birthday ever, for it was given by me, Dio.

41:09.360 --> 41:14.080
And I said birthday wish ever, but I do think that Dio does grant people birthdays.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.840
I don't think it's your birthday unless Dio clears it.

41:15.840 --> 41:16.880
Unless Dio stops by.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.560
He's very, very busy.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.280
Just kidding.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.520
He's super not, probably.

41:21.520 --> 41:22.400
Isn't he dead?

41:22.400 --> 41:23.600
He's fundamentally dead.

41:27.120 --> 41:29.680
It's not funny that he died, but it's funny I didn't know.

41:29.680 --> 41:33.520
I guess, I guess, kind of, yes, basically.

41:33.520 --> 41:38.720
So, uh, happy birthday, David Early, from me, Dio.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.080
I'm Jesse Thorne.

41:42.080 --> 41:46.880
Bullseye is all about discovering the good stuff in culture that will do nothing less

41:46.880 --> 41:48.480
than change your life.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.160
You know, I've never heard anything like it before.

41:50.160 --> 41:55.280
It'd be like seeing a new color, which I guess is music's like biggest asset is that you

41:55.280 --> 41:56.080
can hear new sounds.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.600
I'll probably never see a new color.

41:57.600 --> 42:03.280
I'll probably never experience like a new crazy taste, but I'll hear new sounds constantly.

42:03.280 --> 42:06.000
Culture picks, comedy, and in-depth interviews.

42:06.000 --> 42:10.880
It's the good stuff and just the good stuff in popular culture, every week on Bullseye.

42:17.680 --> 42:19.200
Do y'all want a yahoo?

42:19.200 --> 42:19.840
Please.

42:19.840 --> 42:20.320
Yes.

42:20.320 --> 42:24.720
Um, we did Arby's manager as a club banger.

42:24.720 --> 42:27.840
There's a club banger.

42:27.840 --> 42:28.640
I just want to send him by-

42:28.640 --> 42:29.600
That's an instant classic.

42:29.600 --> 42:31.200
I just want to send him by Amelie Belcher.

42:31.200 --> 42:31.920
Thank you, Amelie.

42:31.920 --> 42:33.040
Justin, please don't.

42:33.040 --> 42:36.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Taylor, who asks, Amelie?

42:37.360 --> 42:37.600
No.

42:38.240 --> 42:41.600
Who asks, sneaking bong into music fest?

42:43.360 --> 42:46.320
I'm going to a music festival called Waka-Rusa.

42:47.040 --> 42:50.480
I would like to bring my bong, but I hear they check you.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.640
Like, search your bag if you have one.

42:52.640 --> 42:57.840
Can anyone tell me how to get by with a glass bong or give any tips?

42:57.840 --> 42:58.640
Thanks, everybody.

42:59.760 --> 43:03.200
And that's signed from everyone going to that concert.

43:03.200 --> 43:03.440
Yeah.

43:04.160 --> 43:07.200
Don't waste my time or yours telling me just don't bring it.

43:10.000 --> 43:10.960
Not even an option, my man.

43:10.960 --> 43:11.760
Not even an option.

43:13.360 --> 43:18.880
Can you throw the bong over the checkpoint, make it through, and then catch the bong?

43:18.880 --> 43:23.440
Frankly, you're embarrassing yourself by even suggesting that I don't bring it.

43:23.440 --> 43:24.160
That I don't bring it.

43:24.160 --> 43:26.160
This bong goes where I go, my friend.

43:26.160 --> 43:28.000
It is my Winnie the Pooh of bongs.

43:28.720 --> 43:34.000
I will say, if you go to the right, if you go to the correct music festival,

43:35.040 --> 43:39.920
the people at the checkpoint, I saw this at Bonnaroo all three years that I went,

43:39.920 --> 43:44.000
they will just pull the bong out of your backpack and then put it right back.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.200
Like, they will pull the bong out to make way for the rest of their search,

43:47.200 --> 43:49.680
and they will say, okay, now here's your bong back.

43:49.680 --> 43:50.800
Enjoy your day.

43:50.800 --> 43:51.600
Aren't they checking-

43:51.600 --> 43:54.800
Sorry, I had to move your bong to check out your granola and shit.

43:54.800 --> 43:58.400
Aren't they checking bags to ensure that you have a bong?

43:59.280 --> 44:00.800
Because they booked shitty bands.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.080
Listen, these bands aren't-

44:02.080 --> 44:04.160
Are you really sure about doing this sober?

44:04.160 --> 44:06.880
I'm not sure you're going to really get the full effect.

44:06.880 --> 44:09.200
Do you know who's one of the three headliners at Bonnaroo this year?

44:09.200 --> 44:11.840
It's like the first year since Goblin was last time I went in 2009

44:11.840 --> 44:14.000
that I actually thought about picking up some ticks.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.600
Lionel Richie's in the mix.

44:15.600 --> 44:17.120
Whoa!

44:17.120 --> 44:17.680
Yeah.

44:17.680 --> 44:19.040
How do they pick these things?

44:19.040 --> 44:20.000
How do they-

44:20.000 --> 44:22.640
A fucking the smartest wizard ever picks them and says,

44:22.640 --> 44:23.680
what would Griffin be into?

44:24.640 --> 44:27.040
I do love the mix at Bonnaroo because it's always like,

44:27.040 --> 44:31.280
we've got the Flaming Lips, the Black Keys, and James Taylor.

44:31.280 --> 44:38.080
Guys, if Lionel Richie and the Flaming Lips did a dual performance together,

44:38.080 --> 44:40.480
that would probably be like a really good band.

44:40.480 --> 44:41.520
Don't you think?

44:41.520 --> 44:42.080
Yes.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.280
I mean, that sounds like something they do.

44:43.280 --> 44:46.480
Like I saw the Flaming Lips do all White Stripes shit

44:47.280 --> 44:50.480
when Jack White like broke his hand or whatever.

44:50.480 --> 44:51.360
Man, that was tight.

44:51.360 --> 44:55.120
Anyway, I think I'm probably the only person who's been through

44:55.120 --> 44:56.800
a music festival drug checkpoint.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.840
Unless Justin and Travis, you guys.

44:59.840 --> 45:03.920
I went to Sharon, Lois, and Bram and they were pretty strict about that shit.

45:06.400 --> 45:07.760
You got chewable Tylenol?

45:07.760 --> 45:08.560
What is this shit?

45:08.560 --> 45:13.920
Are you going to eat all these Flintstone vitamins?

45:13.920 --> 45:14.880
You sick fuck.

45:17.760 --> 45:18.960
This is all Dino.

45:18.960 --> 45:19.600
What the fuck?

45:20.160 --> 45:22.080
I have never, Dino is what you, yeah.

45:22.080 --> 45:23.520
Dino is what gets you fucked up.

45:23.520 --> 45:26.960
Announcement, everybody, please do not eat the Purple Barney.

45:26.960 --> 45:29.520
There's some bad Dino going on.

45:29.520 --> 45:30.800
Some bad Dino.

45:31.760 --> 45:32.960
Just stick to the Betty.

45:33.520 --> 45:34.640
Actually, there's not a Betty.

45:34.640 --> 45:35.760
Did you guys know that?

45:35.760 --> 45:36.880
That's bullshit.

45:36.880 --> 45:40.080
Well, largely because the character models for Betty and Wilma

45:40.080 --> 45:41.280
were indistinguishable.

45:41.840 --> 45:42.400
Oh, interesting.

45:42.400 --> 45:44.960
They didn't initially have Betty vitamins.

45:44.960 --> 45:47.360
Also like, I'm going to eat a woman.

45:48.400 --> 45:52.960
Okay, I mean, they had Wilma, so that's not weird.

45:52.960 --> 45:55.600
Betty's in the mix now, but like she wasn't for two decades.

45:55.600 --> 46:00.880
A lot of Vore fetishists were born out of those Vites.

46:01.520 --> 46:02.320
You guys know about Vore?

46:02.320 --> 46:04.720
I learned about Vore while I was looking up Yahoo answers.

46:04.720 --> 46:05.680
Man, it bummed me out.

46:05.680 --> 46:06.880
What?

46:06.880 --> 46:07.840
I don't know.

46:07.840 --> 46:12.080
It is a sexual fetish about swallowing people.

46:13.600 --> 46:14.080
Okay.

46:14.080 --> 46:17.040
There's videos that are like CGI videos.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.000
Like hole?

46:18.000 --> 46:21.280
Yeah, like maybe a giant snake swallows a man

46:21.280 --> 46:23.600
and someone is jerking off to that, yes.

46:23.600 --> 46:25.440
Oh no, I'm aroused.

46:25.440 --> 46:26.320
Oh, damn it.

46:26.320 --> 46:30.240
A gelatinous cube falls on top of a woman and absorbs her.

46:30.240 --> 46:33.840
And there's a dude like, yep, that will be my thing.

46:33.840 --> 46:34.960
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

46:34.960 --> 46:37.440
Do you guys, you guys think it's weird?

46:37.440 --> 46:39.040
Like I'm gonna have a baby soon.

46:39.680 --> 46:43.440
You think that's weird that that baby will only think of,

46:43.440 --> 46:45.040
like when she hears of Flintstones,

46:45.040 --> 46:48.560
like the only context in which she will understand Flintstones

46:48.560 --> 46:52.880
is the people that make both vitamins and pebbles cereal.

46:54.240 --> 46:56.080
Yeah, it's really a cultural touchstone.

46:56.080 --> 46:59.520
Yeah, what an odd corporation that's gonna seem like to her.

46:59.520 --> 47:01.120
What an odd diversification.

47:01.120 --> 47:06.480
Well, and also John Goodman's finest acting role basically ever.

47:06.480 --> 47:09.440
Yeah, she will not be watching the Flintstones.

47:09.440 --> 47:13.600
A lot of adult ideas in the Flintstones.

47:14.400 --> 47:16.080
The second one, it's all about that,

47:16.080 --> 47:18.000
there's like a lady who's trying to seduce him.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.040
That's a married man.

47:19.840 --> 47:24.480
My dream is that I'm in one of the scenes

47:24.480 --> 47:27.360
where Kyle McLaughlin also is

47:27.360 --> 47:30.560
and I like smash through the window, SWAT style.

47:30.560 --> 47:32.000
It's like, we're getting out of here.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.200
Come on, Kyle.

47:33.200 --> 47:34.160
And in the rest of the movie,

47:34.160 --> 47:36.240
there's just like shots of empty rooms.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.560
We took Kyle away.

47:38.560 --> 47:40.640
I got everybody, I got them all out.

47:40.640 --> 47:44.400
It'll be like, but there was like, I couldn't save-

47:44.400 --> 47:45.680
Tom Arnold is still there.

47:45.680 --> 47:47.360
I couldn't save Tom Arnold, he's still in there.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.720
It's like the end of Schindler's List.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.920
If I had one more helicopter, I could have rescued him.

47:51.920 --> 47:54.800
Specifically Tom Arnold, I could have got him out of there.

47:54.800 --> 47:55.680
No, he's doing okay.

47:55.680 --> 48:00.080
I've never under, was that, wasn't that Moranis?

48:00.720 --> 48:02.480
It was, it was Rick Moranis.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.000
I get that, they're interchangeable.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.160
And then after that, he retired from acting.

48:06.160 --> 48:10.560
Yeah, I have never understood bringing a bong anywhere

48:11.200 --> 48:11.920
because it's not like,

48:11.920 --> 48:13.840
it is certainly not the most convenient means

48:13.840 --> 48:16.320
to imbibe that stuff.

48:17.120 --> 48:18.240
I just, am I missing something?

48:18.240 --> 48:20.240
Is there something about the allure of a bong

48:20.240 --> 48:21.360
that like I just-

48:21.360 --> 48:23.760
You are certainly asking the right two people.

48:23.760 --> 48:24.400
All right.

48:24.400 --> 48:26.800
Did you ever know somebody with a bong that had a name?

48:27.520 --> 48:29.520
Yeah, I actually knew someone with a famous bong

48:29.520 --> 48:31.520
that it was featured on the cover of High Times.

48:31.520 --> 48:33.440
What was so famous about it?

48:34.480 --> 48:36.560
A picture of Jesus grew from the resin.

48:36.560 --> 48:40.160
No, that particular bong, that very one

48:40.160 --> 48:41.760
was featured on the cover of High Times

48:41.760 --> 48:42.880
and that's why it was famous.

48:42.880 --> 48:44.560
Oh, so the bong itself,

48:44.560 --> 48:46.640
it was a bong model that was very famous.

48:47.200 --> 48:50.160
No, the bong, the one that he held in his hand

48:50.160 --> 48:50.720
was the one from the-

48:50.720 --> 48:51.600
Did he blow it?

48:51.600 --> 48:53.360
Did he like create it himself?

48:53.360 --> 48:55.520
I mean, there's no such thing as a bong

48:55.520 --> 48:57.680
that everyone has created from like glass.

48:57.680 --> 49:00.000
Why are you getting hung up on the worst details

49:00.000 --> 49:02.480
of the story when we still don't know the name

49:02.480 --> 49:04.640
or distinguishing characteristics of this bong?

49:05.200 --> 49:06.960
The distinguishing characteristic is the bong

49:06.960 --> 49:08.480
where it was about three feet long

49:08.480 --> 49:12.480
and it had these two tree frogs on it

49:12.480 --> 49:14.640
that were like climbing up the sides of the bong.

49:14.640 --> 49:15.120
Sure.

49:15.120 --> 49:17.920
It was mostly primarily blue and clear glass

49:17.920 --> 49:19.360
and it was named Tocan Choke.

49:20.320 --> 49:21.440
Tocan Choke.

49:21.440 --> 49:22.400
Why are there frogs?

49:22.400 --> 49:26.720
I don't know, but the frogs were named Toc and Choke.

49:26.720 --> 49:28.000
They were the two frogs.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.080
How often did you have to feed them?

49:30.880 --> 49:31.600
Feed the frogs?

49:31.600 --> 49:34.160
Um, they ate the resin.

49:34.160 --> 49:35.200
What was the heaviest-

49:35.200 --> 49:36.720
Frogs are fucked up.

49:36.720 --> 49:38.880
What was the heaviest rip you ever got on it?

49:39.760 --> 49:42.240
We've discussed drugs before, so this is a new territory.

49:42.240 --> 49:44.480
One time I took a hit off Tocan Choke

49:44.480 --> 49:47.680
and then felt as though all my organs

49:47.680 --> 49:49.040
were shifting around my body.

49:49.040 --> 49:51.600
I had to go into the other room

49:51.600 --> 49:53.520
and lay down on my friend's weight bench

49:53.520 --> 49:56.320
and just take a quiet minute to let all my organs settle.

49:56.320 --> 49:58.000
Yeah, that'll happen, man.

49:58.000 --> 49:58.640
Get the old-

49:58.640 --> 49:59.600
That was pretty cool.

49:59.600 --> 50:01.200
Get the old meat tornado in there.

50:01.200 --> 50:02.960
I'm a college student living in an apartment

50:02.960 --> 50:05.920
and my neighbor's noisiness keeps me up at night.

50:05.920 --> 50:07.360
Almost every night around 1130,

50:07.360 --> 50:12.240
I'll hear a satisfied, uh, or mmm sound

50:12.240 --> 50:13.280
through our shared wall.

50:13.280 --> 50:15.040
Now you're gonna be up every night.

50:16.160 --> 50:17.840
This goes on for 15 to 30 minutes or so

50:17.840 --> 50:19.280
and then stops.

50:19.280 --> 50:20.400
I've never heard anything else

50:20.400 --> 50:23.040
besides my neighbor's deep groans of satisfaction.

50:23.040 --> 50:26.240
I can only assume that he's jerking it.

50:26.240 --> 50:28.320
It's not exactly loud,

50:28.320 --> 50:31.360
but knowing that a dude is going to town on his hog

50:31.360 --> 50:35.520
mere feet from me makes falling asleep difficult.

50:36.240 --> 50:38.160
Other than these pleasure moans,

50:38.160 --> 50:39.840
I never hear from the guy.

50:40.720 --> 50:42.160
He doesn't call, he doesn't write.

50:42.960 --> 50:46.960
I have only seen him once or twice in the last few months.

50:46.960 --> 50:50.960
How do I deal with these loud jerk-off noises?

50:50.960 --> 50:53.760
That's from extremely restrained in Raleigh.

50:54.480 --> 50:55.280
Raleigh?

50:55.280 --> 50:56.400
Raleigh, North Carolina?

50:57.440 --> 50:58.160
Raleigh.

50:58.160 --> 51:00.000
From Raleigh's, North Carolina.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.440
From inside of Raleigh's.

51:03.360 --> 51:04.720
Oh, Jesus.

51:04.720 --> 51:05.120
How do you-

51:05.120 --> 51:05.840
Okay, a lot.

51:06.720 --> 51:09.280
When you hear it, you just have to loudly say,

51:09.280 --> 51:10.320
nice, dude.

51:10.320 --> 51:12.160
Nice jerk sesh, dude.

51:13.520 --> 51:15.120
You are getting it, son.

51:15.120 --> 51:16.560
You crushed it.

51:16.560 --> 51:17.440
Did it again.

51:19.280 --> 51:20.640
Too fruition, bro.

51:21.520 --> 51:22.800
Dude, too fast.

51:22.800 --> 51:24.480
You gotta peek and back off.

51:26.720 --> 51:29.040
I have been at Home Depot a lot lately

51:29.040 --> 51:31.600
because I own a house and have no fucking idea what I'm doing.

51:32.240 --> 51:34.400
And I was in the drywall section

51:34.400 --> 51:37.600
and it struck me how thin them shits is

51:37.600 --> 51:39.920
and that I have been in so many situations

51:39.920 --> 51:43.840
where I've had roommates who were probably doing this activity

51:43.840 --> 51:49.040
and now I know the, like, the slightness of the barrier

51:49.040 --> 51:50.080
that was in between us.

51:50.080 --> 51:52.800
We were just basically jerking off right next to me.

51:52.800 --> 51:53.920
So what you're gonna need to do

51:53.920 --> 51:55.520
is you're gonna need to get yourself some bricks

51:55.520 --> 51:56.640
and some mortar.

51:56.640 --> 51:58.800
And you're gonna need to put a new wall into your room

51:58.800 --> 52:01.760
that's six feet away from the wall that already exists.

52:01.760 --> 52:03.600
Gotta build a new house inside your house.

52:04.480 --> 52:05.040
Basically.

52:06.720 --> 52:10.720
It's like the little tent that sweet Haley Cho Lawson made

52:10.720 --> 52:12.560
and the six cents to keep the ghosts out

52:12.560 --> 52:16.880
and it'll be like that, but the ghost jerking off.

52:16.880 --> 52:19.760
What you basically need is your own personal sweat lodge

52:19.760 --> 52:22.880
inside your basement that you go to to ignore the sound.

52:22.880 --> 52:24.080
Like a panic room.

52:24.080 --> 52:26.080
Instead of a spectral Misha Barton,

52:26.640 --> 52:29.200
we're talking about a dude that's probably just jerking off

52:29.200 --> 52:29.680
over there.

52:31.360 --> 52:32.960
At least he keeps a regular schedule.

52:33.760 --> 52:36.160
You can be out of the room at 1130.

52:36.160 --> 52:37.280
Is that, okay.

52:37.280 --> 52:42.880
Okay, if you hit the ceiling with a broom handle,

52:43.920 --> 52:45.840
like the moment that this happens,

52:46.720 --> 52:48.240
is that worth?

52:48.800 --> 52:50.800
Okay, so like that might solve your problem,

52:50.800 --> 52:53.200
but is it going to be worth the sort of like

52:53.200 --> 52:57.760
eternal heart wrenching salting of this guy's personal game?

52:58.960 --> 53:00.080
Like forever.

53:00.080 --> 53:01.600
Because the moment he hears,

53:01.600 --> 53:03.040
like the moment you have that exchange,

53:03.040 --> 53:05.440
not only will he never masturbate again,

53:05.440 --> 53:11.440
but he will have to wonder like how many times.

53:11.440 --> 53:14.080
He might have to come kill you.

53:15.120 --> 53:19.120
He may have to legitimately come kill you.

53:20.560 --> 53:21.360
Is that worth the risk?

53:21.360 --> 53:21.920
He knew too much.

53:23.760 --> 53:26.880
I don't want to dive too deep into this person's psychoses,

53:28.960 --> 53:33.600
but why is he making sounds jerking off?

53:33.600 --> 53:36.800
Like why is he like, oh yeah, myself.

53:36.800 --> 53:38.160
I am doing awesome.

53:38.160 --> 53:40.560
Oh yeah, Steve, who is me.

53:40.560 --> 53:42.400
You know how I like it.

53:42.400 --> 53:43.920
Oh, Steve, keep it up.

53:45.440 --> 53:46.080
Yes, me.

53:46.800 --> 53:52.000
Oh, I, yes, good job.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.280
Oh, our God.

53:53.280 --> 53:55.920
Oh, us, good, good, good.

53:56.560 --> 53:57.440
Me, yay.

53:58.480 --> 53:59.680
I did it.

53:59.680 --> 54:00.880
I'm doing it.

54:00.880 --> 54:01.600
Me, yay.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.920
This one's on us.

54:04.800 --> 54:06.320
Usually when you do that stuff,

54:06.320 --> 54:08.080
it's to like let the other person know,

54:08.080 --> 54:09.520
like keep it up.

54:09.520 --> 54:12.240
You don't have to get worried until you hear him shouting

54:12.240 --> 54:14.480
something that's obviously a safe word.

54:14.480 --> 54:16.080
That's the point at which.

54:16.080 --> 54:17.200
Banana, banana.

54:20.480 --> 54:21.760
I said banana.

54:21.760 --> 54:22.800
You have to move.

54:24.240 --> 54:25.360
You have to move away.

54:25.360 --> 54:29.120
You can't, you can't alert him to the problem

54:29.120 --> 54:32.800
without giving him motive to kill you.

54:32.800 --> 54:34.640
Do you have a roommate that you could convince

54:34.640 --> 54:35.920
to switch rooms with you?

54:35.920 --> 54:37.280
Oh, that's not bad.

54:37.280 --> 54:38.400
That's not bad.

54:38.400 --> 54:39.840
Hey, the function of my room's off

54:39.840 --> 54:41.920
because the light's coming from the east or whatever

54:41.920 --> 54:42.880
and I can hear this guy.

54:43.440 --> 54:44.160
Nope, you don't know.

54:45.120 --> 54:46.640
I'm just saying like, I think I feel like

54:46.640 --> 54:48.960
you are more of a south yellow wall.

54:48.960 --> 54:50.800
Why don't you go ahead and just give my room a shot.

54:50.800 --> 54:51.280
Okay, bye.

54:52.960 --> 54:54.640
When you love to be there the first night

54:54.640 --> 54:55.520
where he comes knocking.

54:55.520 --> 54:58.240
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Kevin.

54:58.240 --> 54:59.840
Kevin, remember we switched?

55:00.400 --> 55:01.600
I would like to switch back.

55:01.600 --> 55:03.360
Oh, sorry, no takesies backsies.

55:04.880 --> 55:05.760
He's doing what?

55:06.640 --> 55:07.040
I don't know.

55:07.040 --> 55:08.240
I've never done that before.

55:08.240 --> 55:09.520
I've never heard that sound.

55:09.520 --> 55:11.040
Must have the ears of a bat.

55:11.040 --> 55:12.160
What is jerking off?

55:13.840 --> 55:14.640
Jerking off.

55:15.920 --> 55:17.120
Yeah, that makes a lot more sense.

55:18.240 --> 55:19.120
Thank you so much.

55:19.120 --> 55:20.320
Jerking out?

55:20.320 --> 55:21.120
He's jerking out.

55:22.880 --> 55:25.200
Thank you so much for listening to our comedy podcast,

55:25.200 --> 55:26.320
my brother, my brother and me.

55:26.320 --> 55:27.600
Uh, real quick.

55:27.600 --> 55:30.560
I have been neglecting to do this forever.

55:30.560 --> 55:33.600
So I wanted to say thank you to all the people

55:33.600 --> 55:37.440
who sent us Candle Nights gifts, uh, PO Box 54,

55:37.440 --> 55:39.200
Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

55:39.200 --> 55:40.880
Wow, a little belated.

55:40.880 --> 55:42.320
A little belated, sorry.

55:42.320 --> 55:43.760
I've had this sheet of paper here.

55:43.760 --> 55:46.320
Thank you to Veronica for the horse ties.

55:46.320 --> 55:47.360
She made us horse ties.

55:47.360 --> 55:47.920
What?

55:47.920 --> 55:50.800
Cody Garrett sent us some fruity yummy mummy.

55:50.800 --> 55:53.200
When were you thinking about fucking like forwarding this

55:53.200 --> 55:54.640
to my PO box?

55:54.640 --> 55:58.320
Ryan sent us three scratch off Illinois lottery tickets.

55:58.320 --> 55:59.120
No winners in that.

55:59.120 --> 56:00.240
I'm sorry to report.

56:00.240 --> 56:01.520
God damn it, Justin.

56:01.520 --> 56:03.600
One's for you, one's for me, one's for Griffin.

56:03.600 --> 56:05.920
You understand that there's like a Trinity thing happening.

56:05.920 --> 56:07.760
How can I figure out how to distribute them

56:07.760 --> 56:09.280
until I saw which one's the winner?

56:09.280 --> 56:11.200
If only there was another mail system.

56:11.200 --> 56:11.760
Yeah, it's weird.

56:11.760 --> 56:13.840
It's like, uh, yeah, mine was the only winner.

56:14.720 --> 56:15.040
I know.

56:15.760 --> 56:17.040
I mean, our PO Box is in Huntington,

56:17.040 --> 56:18.160
so maybe we should move.

56:18.160 --> 56:20.320
Patrick and Christina sent us a book called

56:20.320 --> 56:21.200
Why Does My Horse?

56:21.200 --> 56:25.840
Uh, Roger sent us a book of country proverbs.

56:25.840 --> 56:26.640
You're gonna finish?

56:26.640 --> 56:28.080
You're gonna finish the name of the book?

56:28.080 --> 56:29.120
That's it.

56:29.120 --> 56:30.640
That's the name of it.

56:30.640 --> 56:32.000
Why Does My Horse?

56:32.000 --> 56:33.280
Why Does My Horse?

56:33.280 --> 56:33.920
Question mark.

56:34.800 --> 56:37.040
Uh, Josh sent us Horseopoly.

56:37.920 --> 56:40.080
Oh my God, I've played, I haven't played Horseopoly,

56:40.080 --> 56:42.160
but it's at the lake house we go to every year.

56:42.160 --> 56:43.120
It looks like a blast.

56:43.120 --> 56:44.880
Got a mammoth book of ghost romance,

56:44.880 --> 56:47.360
but I lost the label, so I'm sorry about that.

56:47.360 --> 56:48.720
People sent us some shit.

56:48.720 --> 56:49.600
That's crazy.

56:49.600 --> 56:50.080
Jesus.

56:50.080 --> 56:53.920
Yeah, Alex sent us his game Nom de Nom that he made,

56:53.920 --> 56:56.480
and Ian and Julie made us some pretzels,

56:56.480 --> 56:58.080
some power break pretzels that we could-

56:58.080 --> 56:58.880
Are they still good?

56:59.680 --> 57:00.560
They were gone.

57:00.560 --> 57:01.200
They were good.

57:01.920 --> 57:04.880
I can't fucking believe you've been hoarding presents.

57:04.880 --> 57:07.040
I've been hoarding them until you guys come visit,

57:07.040 --> 57:07.520
which is-

57:07.520 --> 57:09.280
FedEx, I'll pay for the FedEx.

57:09.280 --> 57:11.760
I'll pay for you to forward that shit for pretzels.

57:13.600 --> 57:14.320
You know.

57:14.320 --> 57:17.200
Listen, thank you.

57:17.200 --> 57:18.800
Thank you.

57:18.800 --> 57:21.840
Also, thanks for the wedding invite to Stephanie and Philip,

57:21.840 --> 57:26.640
who are getting married in Singapore in like two weeks.

57:26.640 --> 57:27.200
So thank you.

57:27.200 --> 57:28.320
I'll be there.

57:28.320 --> 57:30.480
Can't make it, but we sure appreciate you sending that out.

57:30.480 --> 57:32.480
I can't make it, because here's the problem.

57:32.480 --> 57:34.640
I've only had like three minutes to prepare,

57:34.640 --> 57:36.880
and not the four months that you fucking intended.

57:39.040 --> 57:40.160
Should we talk about the live show?

57:40.160 --> 57:42.800
Because we're doing a fucking lot of them now.

57:42.800 --> 57:43.840
Yeah, okay.

57:43.840 --> 57:44.880
So here's the deal.

57:44.880 --> 57:49.120
We sort of, we decided to do shows in New York,

57:49.120 --> 57:50.720
and when we decided to do them,

57:50.720 --> 57:52.240
we didn't know how many people were going to come out,

57:52.240 --> 57:54.480
so we didn't want to get like a massive-

57:54.480 --> 57:57.760
We thought 12 at most.

57:58.480 --> 57:59.040
Tops.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.160
So what happened was,

58:00.160 --> 58:02.080
we basically sold out two of our shows

58:02.080 --> 58:05.840
at the People's Improv Theater pretty much almost instantly.

58:07.200 --> 58:08.400
They were up for like the night.

58:08.960 --> 58:09.840
We published them in the afternoon,

58:09.840 --> 58:11.520
it was up and it was sold out in the morning.

58:11.520 --> 58:13.120
Then we released more tickets.

58:13.120 --> 58:16.560
They went up a little bit earlier than we intended.

58:16.560 --> 58:18.480
We didn't have any control over that,

58:18.480 --> 58:20.160
but the trigger got pulled a little bit early,

58:20.160 --> 58:23.280
and so there were people who set calendar alerts and shit

58:23.280 --> 58:25.280
for the time that they were supposed to go on sale,

58:25.280 --> 58:27.360
and they were sold out long before it got there,

58:28.400 --> 58:30.080
which we are very sorry for.

58:30.080 --> 58:31.440
So here's the insanity.

58:31.440 --> 58:34.720
At 1.30 on Saturday, May 24th,

58:34.720 --> 58:36.560
we were doing yet another show

58:38.720 --> 58:40.400
at the People's Improv Theater.

58:40.400 --> 58:44.960
You can get tickets this Wednesday at exactly,

58:44.960 --> 58:48.400
we have been assured, exactly noon EST.

58:48.400 --> 58:50.240
That'll be the 9th, April 9th.

58:50.240 --> 58:53.040
April 9th, Wednesday, noon EST.

58:53.600 --> 58:56.320
If you don't listen to the show early, we're sorry.

58:56.320 --> 58:58.400
We also put it on like our social media and stuff,

58:58.400 --> 59:00.320
but that's the deal, okay?

59:00.320 --> 59:02.560
Noon EST this Wednesday.

59:03.840 --> 59:05.680
If you already have tickets to one of the two other shows,

59:05.680 --> 59:06.720
please like-

59:06.720 --> 59:07.520
That's the other thing, please.

59:07.520 --> 59:09.440
We saw a lot of people like do that

59:09.440 --> 59:10.560
to come to both shows, and it's great

59:10.560 --> 59:12.960
that you guys want to spend that much time with us,

59:12.960 --> 59:14.800
and you're very sweet, but please,

59:16.480 --> 59:17.680
don't get tickets to this other one,

59:17.680 --> 59:19.840
because there are a lot more people who want to come.

59:19.840 --> 59:23.200
If there end up day of being tickets left or whatever,

59:23.200 --> 59:25.600
then by all means, please come to all three.

59:27.040 --> 59:28.800
That probably will not happen, we hope.

59:28.800 --> 59:29.440
No.

59:29.440 --> 59:31.120
We wouldn't think so, but please don't buy tickets

59:31.120 --> 59:31.920
if you already have them.

59:32.800 --> 59:35.520
And that sounds like the most egotistical thing in the world,

59:35.520 --> 59:36.720
but that's the deal.

59:36.720 --> 59:37.680
So please don't do that.

59:37.680 --> 59:40.880
Anyway, you can get- We literally can't add any more shows.

59:40.880 --> 59:42.800
No, Justin's doing, so it's Sawbones,

59:42.800 --> 59:44.240
and my brother, my brother and me.

59:44.240 --> 59:46.160
Justin's doing six podcasts in one day.

59:46.160 --> 59:47.360
It's fucking insane.

59:47.360 --> 59:49.680
I don't know how it's gonna work yet.

59:49.680 --> 59:51.680
But we're doing it for you because we love you.

59:51.680 --> 59:53.520
Yeah, it's not, there's no other reason

59:53.520 --> 59:55.440
other than there are a lot of sad people

59:55.440 --> 59:57.600
and we didn't want that, so that's what we're doing.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.440
And as far as like hanging out afterwards,

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.400
I don't know, because we were doing six shows.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.920
I don't know when we're gonna be-

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.360
But maybe in between.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:10.160
You can give us like a power bar and like a Gatorade.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.360
Yeah, really, no kidding.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.840
Yeah, if people want to bring me some like Pepsi Max,

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.760
that would be like greatly appreciated.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.920
If you can find Josta, then we would really appreciate some Josta.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.840
Maybe just some fries or something would be great.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.280
See, I say that as a joke now,

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.880
knowing that people will actually deliver,

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.760
which would be amazing.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.120
The pit-nyc.com is the address,

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.680
the web address where you can find those.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.280
If you look at their calendar section,

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.960
you'll see where those tickets are gonna pop up.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.040
You can also follow them on Twitter.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.120
I'm sure they'll tweet right as those go available.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.480
But anyway, that's what you need to do.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.440
Please come and see us.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.560
You are great.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.960
I also want to thank Nature Box for supporting the show.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.600

I also want to say thank you to Hulu Plus,

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.520
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.200
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.880
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.720
It's a really great album.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.960
We got an email from somebody actually,

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.480
I think had a question on this show

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.480
who said they were hanging out with John Roderick

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.720
talking about how they got into The Long Winters

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.880
because of us and that's so crazy to me

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.240
because before we did the show,

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.200
I recommended that band to so many people.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:43.920
So I don't know.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.200
It's cool that we have a weird vehicle to do that more

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.680
because they're really, really, really good.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.640
That's it.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.840
I want to hear one more question.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.160
Oh, go to maximumfun.org.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.520
You can listen to all the other great shows there.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.440
There's Jordan Just To Go, Judge John Hodgman,

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.680

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.800
Oh No, Ross and Carrie.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.400

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:08.960
Song Exploder.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.000
Bam Bam Pow.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:10.320
Yeah.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:11.920
Sawbones.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.640
I make a medical history podcast with my wife called Sawbones.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.360
She's a doctor.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.880
I'm an idiot and it's fun.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.760
It's good to listen.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.920
It's my wife's favorite podcast on the network.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.440
Take that.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.320
So there's that.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.600
So there's that to deal with.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:26.000
Anyway, go listen to all those shows.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.080
We need one more question from Griffin.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.320
Sure, this one was sent in by Emerald member Drew Davenport.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.040
Thank you, Drew.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:36.080
It's by Yahoo answer suzer Philip who asks,

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.080
what kind of car does Judge Judy own?

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.080
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.120
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.360
This has been my brother and brother and me.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.000
Kiss your dad.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:03:02.480
Score on the lips.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.400
Maximumfun.org.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.440
Comedy and culture.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.560
Artist owned.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.760
Listener supported.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:12.640
I'm Carrie Poppy.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.520
I'm Ross Botcher.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.560
And we make a show.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.680
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.400
Oh no.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.400
We investigate fringe science.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.440
Spirituality.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.400
Religious groups.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.760
Alternative therapies.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.640
We put ourselves through a lot of uncomfortable situations.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.760
So that you don't have to.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.360
Because really, why would you?

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.360
For example, I watched a tube be inserted into Ross's anus.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.840
That's true, but it sounds terrible out of context.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:36.800
We've tried penis and breast enlargement pills.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.280
We spent six months undercover becoming Mormons.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.040
We hung out with the 9-11 truthers.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.800
The UFO cult, the Raelians.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.680
And we're going to do more.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.800
It's one of the newest shows on Maximumfun.org.
