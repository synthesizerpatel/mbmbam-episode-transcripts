WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.840
Hey, it's Griffin.

00:00.840 --> 00:01.920
Real quick before we get to the episode

00:01.920 --> 00:03.500
because we forgot to mention it.

00:03.500 --> 00:05.160
We have some new live shows to announce

00:05.160 --> 00:08.520
that we are gonna be doing at the end of November.

00:08.520 --> 00:11.200
We are going to be playing here in Austin, Texas

00:11.200 --> 00:12.440
at the Moody Theater.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.920
On November 27th, we are doing MBMBAM

00:14.920 --> 00:16.360
and then on the 28th,

00:16.360 --> 00:18.760
we're doing the Adventure Zone here in Austin.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.320
And then for the first time ever,

00:20.320 --> 00:23.360
we are going to Denver on November the 29th

00:23.360 --> 00:25.880
at the Temple-Hoyne-Buhl Theater

00:25.880 --> 00:27.720
and we're doing MBMBAM there.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.640
So Austin, the 27th, doing MBMBAM, 28th, Adventure Zone

00:31.640 --> 00:35.160
and then off to Denver for one more MBMBAM on the 29th.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.160
And yeah, we're very, very excited.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.360
Well, I'm excited that I don't have to travel

00:39.360 --> 00:40.360
for most of those shows,

00:40.360 --> 00:42.600
but I'm excited to get back up to Colorado.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.840
So tickets for this are going to be on sale

00:44.840 --> 00:48.680
for the public on Friday, September 14th

00:48.680 --> 00:52.960
at 10 a.m. local time to where the venues are.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.700
But we are also doing a fan pre-sale

00:55.700 --> 00:57.260
for tickets for these shows,

00:57.260 --> 01:00.320
which is going to be Wednesday, September the 12th

01:00.320 --> 01:03.480
at 10 a.m. local time to Thursday,

01:03.480 --> 01:06.160
September the 13th at 10 local.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.440
And in order to access that pre-sale,

01:08.440 --> 01:10.840
which runs Wednesday through Thursday,

01:10.840 --> 01:11.840
you have to enter a password.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.400
The password is mybrother, all one word, all caps.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.240
You type that in, you'll get some early access

01:17.240 --> 01:20.000
to a batch of the tickets for all those shows.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.080
So that's it in November, Austin, Denver.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.680
We're gonna tweet out links to all the ticket sales

01:26.680 --> 01:28.600
for the different venues.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.880
So keep an eye on our social media channels if you want it.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.580
Again, they go on sale to public on Friday.

01:32.580 --> 01:35.480
There's a pre-sale Wednesday and Thursday

01:35.480 --> 01:36.400
if you use mybrother.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.600
Okay, that's it.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.800
Here's the show.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.440
The McElroy brothers are not experts

01:41.440 --> 01:44.320
and their advice should never be followed.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.680
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

01:46.680 --> 01:50.060
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

01:50.060 --> 01:52.400
Also, this show isn't for kids,

01:52.400 --> 01:54.800
which I mentioned only so the babies out there

01:54.800 --> 01:57.120
will know how cool they are for listening.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.320
What's up, you cool baby?

01:58.320 --> 01:59.320
It's familiar, but not too familiar,

01:59.320 --> 02:00.320
but not too not familiar.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.320
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say,

02:01.320 --> 02:02.320
hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.320
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother and my brother's

02:03.320 --> 02:04.320
show, the McElroy brothers.

02:04.320 --> 02:28.320
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.160
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

02:31.160 --> 02:36.480
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30, oh, he got me.

02:36.480 --> 02:37.480
Oh no.

02:37.480 --> 02:38.480
Oh, shoot.

02:38.480 --> 02:39.480
Oh, shoot.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.480
Oh, shoot.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.480
Griffin's blood and guts are everywhere.

02:43.480 --> 02:47.360
Oh, bang, he got me, shoot.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.520
The predator got me.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.760
It's the Predator Watch 2018.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.600
Griffin, can I ask you a question?

02:51.600 --> 02:53.600
Did you see it coming?

02:53.600 --> 02:54.600
I did not.

02:54.600 --> 02:59.160
I did, I had on the thermal goggles that I can use

02:59.160 --> 03:02.280
to see the predator when he comes towards me.

03:02.280 --> 03:05.320
But the problem is he had just went to the Cold Stone Creamery

03:05.320 --> 03:08.160
and had a gotta have it, gotta have it, gotta need it,

03:08.160 --> 03:09.680
and he cooled his body way down.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.920
So he was essentially invisible in every respect,

03:12.920 --> 03:16.160
and then he got me with his arm swords,

03:16.160 --> 03:21.320
and he got me just from butt to cheek, butt to like head cheek,

03:21.320 --> 03:24.120
and he cut me all the way open half-wise.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.120
Dancing cheek to cheek.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.120
Yep, yep.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.020
Folks, as you've almost certainly guessed,

03:28.020 --> 03:30.400
we got a Predator Watch on our hands.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.760
After thinking that the predator was gone,

03:33.760 --> 03:40.720
he's back on this one, and he is not pleased, okay?

03:40.720 --> 03:41.720
Let's put it that way.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.980
He is not excited.

03:43.980 --> 03:46.840
Take it from me, you are gonna wanna catch this predator.

03:46.840 --> 03:47.840
Oh, yes.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.920
Folks, the predator is not happy.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.200
He has been out of the game for a while,

03:53.200 --> 03:57.680
but he is back in full force in The Predator

03:57.680 --> 04:03.560
a 2018 film coming out this year, I believe.

04:03.560 --> 04:09.260
Now Griffin, a lot of people are buzzing about Glover.

04:09.260 --> 04:10.900
This new predator stars a gentleman

04:10.900 --> 04:13.120
whose name is Boyd Holbrook,

04:13.120 --> 04:17.360
and he looks like a, you know, tall glass of water,

04:17.360 --> 04:19.360
and he will be playing sort of the...

04:19.360 --> 04:20.360
Predator.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.400
No, no, he's the predator predator,

04:22.400 --> 04:24.520
the one who predates the predator,

04:24.520 --> 04:28.280
but he's playing sort of the Arnold archetype.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.280
The predator-predator.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.280
Yeah, no.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.280
The predator-hunter.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.240
Still wrong.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.400
Predator-consumer.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.720
The one who gets the predator,

04:35.720 --> 04:40.080
and this role in Predator 2 is filled by Danny Glover

04:40.080 --> 04:42.600
and or Gary Busey, depending on how you looked at it,

04:42.600 --> 04:44.920
and obviously Predator 1, you had Arnold Schwarzenegger

04:44.920 --> 04:47.760
and just a whole lot of just sort of thick-armed gentlemen

04:47.760 --> 04:48.760
in that one.

04:48.760 --> 04:51.480
The Predators, it's important to point out,

04:51.480 --> 04:53.800
cast this sort of thick-armed gentleman role

04:53.800 --> 04:57.840
as Adrien Brody, which it still seems...

04:57.840 --> 04:59.800
That's where we're going, huh?

04:59.800 --> 05:00.800
That's where we're going, huh?

05:00.800 --> 05:02.480
Just gonna go ahead and get him in the mix, huh?

05:02.480 --> 05:04.400
Great, great, talented, talented.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
Great and talented.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.400
Arms?

05:06.400 --> 05:07.760
Did he beef up a lot for that?

05:07.760 --> 05:11.200
No, I mean, you could still fit about nine Adrien Brody arms

05:11.200 --> 05:14.000
comfortably inside of one of Arnold's gloves.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
You know what I mean?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.760
Mm-hmm, yeah.

05:17.760 --> 05:21.360
Here's two real names of characters in The Predator.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.920
Quinn McKenna and Nebraska Williams.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.720
Oh, I like that.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.680
Good, very good.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.680
I like that.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.480
Here's some more names of characters.

05:30.480 --> 05:35.880
Casey Brackett, Traeger, Baxley, Lynch, Niddles,

05:35.880 --> 05:40.000
Keyes, Dupree, Sapir, Coyle.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.120
There are just a lot of them like that.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.800
I've never seen any Predator movies.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.240
Seems like a good one to start out with is The Predators.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.600
Yeah, The Predators.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.080
I mean, I know, is The Predators,

05:52.080 --> 05:55.600
that sounds like a sitcom starring Predators.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.400
That would be so funny.

05:57.400 --> 06:02.320
Oh, like the Geico Cavemen, but with invisible alien guys.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.520
They did Predator good.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.800
Predator 2, love it.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.840
Predators, I don't know.

06:08.840 --> 06:09.840
Where are we at?

06:09.840 --> 06:10.840
You've kind of lost me.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.160
It's been 20 years.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.560
Predators, OK.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.280
And then this one is The Predator.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.200
So I guess a lot of The Predators were like,

06:17.200 --> 06:19.080
that's probably enough for us.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.040
We're going to go.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.880
And then one Predator was like, I'm going to kick it

06:22.880 --> 06:25.680
and just kind of see where this all goes.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.080
So the next one's going to be just-

06:27.080 --> 06:28.240
They actually snuck it out

06:28.240 --> 06:30.280
so that people wouldn't steal the film

06:30.280 --> 06:31.960
by calling it a Predator.

06:31.960 --> 06:32.800
And people were like, well,

06:32.800 --> 06:33.920
I don't want to just see a Predator.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.320
I don't want to see a Predator.

06:35.320 --> 06:38.240
I want to see some Predators, the next sequel.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.320
And this one's going to come out.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.160
This one. A few Predators.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.840
And in this one, they're going to go back to,

06:43.840 --> 06:46.320
they're actually going to get Adam Brody in this one.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.000
And he's going to be very sort of sardonic to the Predator

06:49.000 --> 06:50.840
who will spit its acid at him.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.320
Oh my God, can you guys imagine

06:52.320 --> 06:57.320
what if they crossed Predators with The Predator?

06:58.120 --> 07:00.160
And I think they'd call it The Predators.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.560
And I think it might go a little something like this.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.240
There's not going to be an end to this joke.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.200
There is not going to be a middle to this joke.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.800
Glomgor, I'm home.

07:07.800 --> 07:11.080
I don't know what like Predator naming conventions are.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.600
No, Glomgor is maybe more or less it.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.440
Okay.

07:14.440 --> 07:18.480
Why can't they give The Predator a name?

07:18.480 --> 07:21.360
I mean, most of the one is like, this one has dogs.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.040
This one has two swords.

07:23.040 --> 07:23.920
And that's kind of sort of,

07:23.920 --> 07:25.320
this one is bigger than the other one

07:25.320 --> 07:26.920
and sort of tears its head off.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.040
This one has a bad credit score.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.840
Anyway, The Predator, we're all very,

07:30.840 --> 07:32.160
I feel like this is the first one

07:32.160 --> 07:33.880
where you guys really aren't fucking excited about.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.760
I have never, here's what I know.

07:35.760 --> 07:36.840
Here's what I know.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.960
They got masks and underneath their masks

07:39.960 --> 07:41.680
are faces that look just like their masks.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.320
But you know, now that I'm thinking about it,

07:43.320 --> 07:46.040
that is generally how masks work.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.680
If I take off a mask, it's generally human shaped.

07:48.680 --> 07:50.520
Isn't that true for all of us though?

07:50.520 --> 07:51.400
Oh, that's so deep.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.200
I know that they can turn invisible.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.480
They can see heat.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.280
And so you put mud on yourself

07:56.280 --> 07:58.640
and that both is gonna protect you from the predators

07:58.640 --> 08:01.560
and also it's gonna soften your skin up real good.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.120
They have, I think, lasers and swords.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.440
They hate aliens.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.280
They're-

08:07.280 --> 08:10.840
Travis, you know, for someone who's ever seen these films,

08:10.840 --> 08:12.920
are you trying to hustle me somehow?

08:12.920 --> 08:14.640
Are you about to like bet that you don't know

08:14.640 --> 08:16.880
about the Predator, but then you've seen all the movies

08:16.880 --> 08:18.620
a million times and you're actually about to take

08:18.620 --> 08:19.920
all my lunch money?

08:19.920 --> 08:23.600
No, Griffin, I've just watched TV ever.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.440
Okay.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.840
And so I've seen the references.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.940
I love the Predator, okay?

08:30.240 --> 08:33.160
This film, I am wild about, and Griffin's right.

08:33.160 --> 08:35.160
I haven't been letting my enthusiasm show through.

08:35.160 --> 08:38.580
That's the problem with the 2018 ironic detachment.

08:38.580 --> 08:40.200
I'm wild about the Predator.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.160
Yeah.

08:41.160 --> 08:44.300
The movie, I saw the first one when I was too young

08:44.300 --> 08:45.140
to see it.

08:45.140 --> 08:47.880
Like everybody who saw the first Predator movie,

08:47.880 --> 08:48.840
it was too young to watch it.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.400
None of us were ready.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.480
Got a little spooked.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.760
We were all a little bit young to be seeing this one.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.520
Trav, here's the story with this guy.

08:55.520 --> 08:59.840
He is not angry at us.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.040
He's not disappointed in us.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.360
He's just above us.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.640
And so he hunts us like the dogs we are.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.860
Wow.

09:07.860 --> 09:11.120
The Predator is the first one where we deserve it.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.840
And I think that we all should welcome the Predator

09:13.840 --> 09:15.840
and say, we get it.

09:15.840 --> 09:18.240
Wait, is the Predator the hero of the movie?

09:18.240 --> 09:20.120
It depends on how you look at it.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.860
You gotta say, Predator, you take a turn.

09:22.860 --> 09:25.840
In this one, the Predator is the hero.

09:25.840 --> 09:29.400
He is finally standing up to humanity

09:29.400 --> 09:31.480
in a way that no one else has the guts to.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.320
He's finally putting us in our place.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.040
Well, think about how many movies there have been

09:35.040 --> 09:38.400
where human beings eat a burger or have a steak or whatever.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.760
And we're all fine with that.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.800
So why do we have such a problem with the Predator

09:42.800 --> 09:44.200
hunting us, you know what I mean?

09:44.200 --> 09:46.200
We're hunting cows.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.880
Can I tell you what happens at the end of Predator 2?

09:48.880 --> 09:49.720
Of course you can, Justin.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.000
Because it's like one of my favorite,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.560
it's one of my favorite things.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.820
So Predator 2 is about Danny Glover

09:56.820 --> 09:59.920
being hunted by Predator, right?

09:59.920 --> 10:01.760
And Danny Glover turns the table

10:01.760 --> 10:06.760
and manages to kill the Predator, right?

10:06.960 --> 10:10.320
And then other Predators show up and they're like,

10:10.320 --> 10:15.280
oh shit, nice, and they give Danny Glover an old gun

10:15.280 --> 10:16.120
because he did such a good job.

10:16.120 --> 10:16.960
Wait, what?

10:16.960 --> 10:17.780
Yeah.

10:17.780 --> 10:20.040
They give Danny Glover an old gun

10:20.040 --> 10:25.040
because he did such a good job and that's it.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.440
Now, and he technically becomes a Predator.

10:27.440 --> 10:28.720
They're saying like, now you are a Predator.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.520
And what's great about that movie

10:30.520 --> 10:34.040
is they really wanted Danny to be like in it.

10:34.040 --> 10:37.480
So they didn't tell him it was a movie.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.080
So when they shot that scene,

10:39.080 --> 10:40.720
yeah, Danny Glover got really scared,

10:40.720 --> 10:42.440
but he was like, no, I'm gonna fucking fight back.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.640
And they just like recorded it and let the camera roll.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.400
It was very real and very visceral

10:47.400 --> 10:50.040
and he killed the actor playing the Predator.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.760
And then the other Predators came in,

10:51.760 --> 10:52.800
were like, you're the Predator now.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.280
And so now like Danny Glover,

10:54.280 --> 10:56.200
he'll show up to set on like Angels in the Outfield

10:56.200 --> 10:57.040
and be like, how are you doing?

10:57.040 --> 10:58.480
And he's like, pretty good.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.480
Just keeping an eye out for Predator work

11:00.480 --> 11:04.000
because I'm not the Predator, but I am a Predator.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.160
And so I will shoot all the aliens I see.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.400
I hate them so much.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.160
I didn't finish my story.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.640
Okay.

11:10.640 --> 11:15.120
The gun that Danny Glover is given by a Predator

11:15.120 --> 11:20.120
was given to that Predator 300 years ago by a pirate.

11:21.120 --> 11:21.960
Wait.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.560
Because the, yes, that's right.

11:24.560 --> 11:28.320
This old, old Predator made a pirate friend.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.560
The pirate friend gave the Predator a gun

11:31.560 --> 11:35.240
and then the Predator was so impressed with Danny Glover

11:35.240 --> 11:37.400
that he gave him his old pirate gun.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.520
Okay, wait, what?

11:38.520 --> 11:41.040
That is not addressed in the film whatsoever.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.160
It's handled in the backstory of the comics,

11:43.160 --> 11:44.560
but it's true and amazing.

11:44.560 --> 11:48.400
So Jack Sparrow gave this Predator a gun.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.240
That's it.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.600
Whoa!

11:50.600 --> 11:53.880
I know, let's get into the advice.

11:53.880 --> 11:54.840
I think we're ready for it

11:54.840 --> 11:57.140
and I think we've all earned it.

11:57.140 --> 12:00.800
My boyfriend likes to buy old, empty wooden boxes

12:00.800 --> 12:02.600
and containers from a thrift store occasionally.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.000
And the other day I saw he had a new one.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.320
I picked it up to look at it

12:06.320 --> 12:08.120
and then with a panel click on his face,

12:08.120 --> 12:11.840
he said, wait, there's weird stuff in there.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.920
So obviously I immediately opened it

12:13.920 --> 12:18.920
to find 30 or 40 little rubber replacement earbuds.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.620
While this is an excessive number of earbuds,

12:23.620 --> 12:25.060
I wouldn't have thought that was weird.

12:25.060 --> 12:29.960
However, he legit panicked and told me it was weird.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.760
So I don't know.

12:31.760 --> 12:32.600
Help me, brothers.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.040
Is this objectively weird?

12:34.040 --> 12:35.440
Why did he panic?

12:35.440 --> 12:38.280
Should I be concerned about his apparent earbud hoarding?

12:38.280 --> 12:40.340
What could he possibly even use them for?

12:40.340 --> 12:44.080
I asked why he had them and he said, I don't know.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.480
There's a lot of options here

12:45.480 --> 12:47.000
and it's gonna be hard for us to fill in the blanks.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.160
He could have thought that they were

12:49.160 --> 12:51.360
little synthetic nipples maybe,

12:51.360 --> 12:53.960
or maybe he eats these damn things.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.000
He definitely eats them.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.200
He definitely just pops them in.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.960
He takes these, he scoops them up in a little Ziploc bag

12:58.960 --> 13:01.280
and he'll go see the Predator at the theater

13:01.280 --> 13:02.960
and they'll be like, snowcups, popcorn?

13:02.960 --> 13:06.640
And he's like, no, I'm sneaking in some, uh-oh.

13:06.640 --> 13:07.480
And they search him and they're like,

13:07.480 --> 13:09.200
all you've got is this little bag of earbuds.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.480
And he says, well, I'm not gonna eat those.

13:11.480 --> 13:12.320
He does, though.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.320
Then he coneheads out and he eats them up.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.160
Mm.

13:17.000 --> 13:17.840
Yeah.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.800
Maybe, oh, it's also possible that right next to that box

13:21.800 --> 13:25.080
was his box full of, I don't know,

13:25.080 --> 13:28.640
teeth that he's found in the world or something,

13:28.640 --> 13:31.640
because he tooth fairies teeth away

13:31.640 --> 13:34.240
and he thought you were reaching for that box

13:34.240 --> 13:36.040
and he was like, oh, the rubber ears,

13:36.040 --> 13:38.000
yeah, that's weird, ha ha ha.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.840
And then on the other side of that box was like,

13:41.840 --> 13:44.880
I don't know, magical stones that he's made.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.760
He thought it was his tooth-haver box

13:47.760 --> 13:50.080
where he has all the teeth that he gets.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.160
I would love it if you were like,

13:51.160 --> 13:53.480
hey, wait, hold on, wait, give that a shake.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.000
Okay, no, that's not the, I thought that was the tooth box.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.520
That one's cool, that one's cool.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.160
That one's fine, actually, go ahead and open it.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.840
This one's kind of squishing around.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.840
Uh, yeah, don't open that one.

14:03.840 --> 14:04.680
Is it wet?

14:04.680 --> 14:05.520
Is that box wet?

14:05.520 --> 14:08.120
Nope, then you can open Sesame.

14:08.120 --> 14:08.960
Go for it.

14:08.960 --> 14:13.560
That's, give that a quick whiff.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.040
Hey, hold on.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.960
Give that a quick whiff.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.480
Do you know what a bunch of teeth smell like?

14:22.480 --> 14:23.600
Ha ha ha!

14:23.600 --> 14:24.560
You do?

14:24.560 --> 14:25.600
Check that.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.440
No?

14:26.440 --> 14:27.320
It's not teeth then.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.360
Why would you say that?

14:28.360 --> 14:29.200
Why would you think it was teeth?

14:29.200 --> 14:30.040
Why would you bring up teeth?

14:30.040 --> 14:32.600
Why do you keep, why do you keep talking about teeth?

14:32.600 --> 14:35.160
Hey, I'm not the one, you're the one asking me

14:35.160 --> 14:36.520
about teeth now, so like.

14:36.520 --> 14:37.920
You brought up teeth, I'm pretty sure,

14:37.920 --> 14:39.080
let the record show.

14:39.080 --> 14:42.800
So like, maybe you're the one obsessed with teeth, huh?

14:42.800 --> 14:43.800
Yeah.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.800
Let's rewind the tape and look at it.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.200
What are you talking about?

14:47.200 --> 14:49.600
Oh, that's my box of tapes that I collect over there.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.080
That's my box of tapes.

14:52.080 --> 14:56.640
I mean, you have not been lied to in this scenario.

14:56.640 --> 15:01.200
They asked if it's a, like, it is a weird thing.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.040
It's weird.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.680
It's weird enough that you wrote into us about it.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.440
You brought it on our desk, so it is weird.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.000
And you did ask them why they have it,

15:08.000 --> 15:09.400
and they said they don't know,

15:09.400 --> 15:12.920
which seems like another fair, non-lie answer.

15:12.920 --> 15:13.760
They don't know.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.800
They just kept them, because you never know.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.520
I mean, that does seem like something

15:17.520 --> 15:19.520
that you might have a utility for at some point.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.600
Hold on, J-Man, because I was just sitting here

15:21.600 --> 15:24.800
thinking about, I don't think you accidentally collect

15:24.800 --> 15:28.400
30 or 40, because that means that, at the very least,

15:28.400 --> 15:32.840
you have bought 15 sets of earbuds

15:32.840 --> 15:34.920
and kept the replacements from them.

15:34.920 --> 15:35.760
Well.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.160
That just seems excessive.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.560
Those have gotta go somewhere,

15:38.560 --> 15:40.480
because you buy a pair of earbuds at the airport

15:40.480 --> 15:43.560
or whatever, and the first thing you do

15:43.560 --> 15:46.040
is you throw those extra ear jellies away,

15:46.040 --> 15:48.720
because has anyone ever been like,

15:48.720 --> 15:50.320
oh no, my ear jelly fell off.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.640
Good thing I've got this replacement ear jelly

15:52.640 --> 15:54.440
to just slop right on there.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.960
No, nobody's ever done that.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.320
Even if it doesn't fit in your ear

15:57.320 --> 15:58.680
and there's other sized ear jellies,

15:58.680 --> 16:00.520
it's like, that seems like a lot of work.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.240
I don't, you know, I'm not at the genius bar.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.080
That's it.

16:04.080 --> 16:07.100
I think, in this scenario, your boyfriend has a fear

16:07.100 --> 16:08.720
that one day they will wake up

16:08.720 --> 16:10.640
and their ears will have shrunk.

16:10.640 --> 16:11.480
Ah, yeah.

16:11.480 --> 16:15.040
And they will need to replace all of their earbuds

16:15.040 --> 16:16.780
with these smaller ones, and they don't wanna tell you that,

16:16.780 --> 16:19.560
because, listen, the chances of that happening

16:19.560 --> 16:20.720
are one in a hundred.

16:20.720 --> 16:24.360
So like, yeah, you don't really need to worry about it,

16:24.360 --> 16:27.020
but like, one day you might wake up

16:27.020 --> 16:30.320
and your ears will be slightly smaller.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.400
That was whimsical as fuck, Trav.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.240
Really?

16:33.240 --> 16:34.060
I feel like I'm on a roll.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.240
Dull story, dawg.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.560
Fuck, dude, sick.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.400
Here's a Yahoo.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.220
It's from level 9000.

16:38.220 --> 16:39.560
Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport, thank you.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.840
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user,

16:41.840 --> 16:43.540
so I'm gonna call them.

16:43.540 --> 16:47.400
Playvus asks, the owner yelled at me?

16:48.520 --> 16:51.200
I went to a takeaway pizza place,

16:51.200 --> 16:52.400
and as I was going in,

16:52.400 --> 16:54.340
a seagull followed me into the place

16:54.340 --> 16:56.360
when I opened the door to look at it.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.960
When the seagull flew into the kitchen,

16:57.960 --> 16:59.480
the manager burst out yelling at me,

16:59.480 --> 17:00.960
saying I had done something wrong.

17:00.960 --> 17:04.160
There were no signs, so I don't think I did anything wrong.

17:04.160 --> 17:05.320
I didn't get to order.

17:05.320 --> 17:06.880
Why would he yell at me?

17:07.800 --> 17:10.020
Did you hold the door open for the bird?

17:13.240 --> 17:14.940
This is the mystery I think we need to solve,

17:14.940 --> 17:16.440
maybe, before we go any further.

17:16.440 --> 17:19.720
I opened up the door to, when I was going into the place,

17:19.720 --> 17:21.360
I opened the door to look at it,

17:21.360 --> 17:23.680
look at the pizza place, or look at the bird?

17:23.680 --> 17:26.680
And then this asker says there were no signs.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.520
Did you, so you're saying you had the conscious thought of,

17:29.520 --> 17:30.640
I'm gonna let this seagull

17:30.640 --> 17:32.560
right the fuck into this restaurant,

17:32.560 --> 17:34.200
but because there's no sign saying,

17:34.200 --> 17:38.280
hey, no big wild ocean birds in here.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.760
This is very much like an Air Bud scenario of like,

17:40.760 --> 17:45.600
well, there's no rules against it, so I guess it's okay.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.200
How much do we need to communicate to people

17:48.200 --> 17:49.240
about what is it?

17:49.240 --> 17:53.280
Can't we just have a big, just a big sign on life

17:53.280 --> 17:55.440
that says, hey, don't let birds in here.

17:55.440 --> 17:58.400
Or like just wild animals in general.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.760
You know no animal can come in here.

18:01.760 --> 18:05.340
Wherever here is, you probably can't let an animal in there.

18:05.340 --> 18:06.180
Like, period.

18:06.180 --> 18:07.880
I do wanna specify wild animal,

18:07.880 --> 18:09.240
because if somebody wanted to bring in

18:09.240 --> 18:12.160
like their cool pet, like boa constrictor,

18:12.160 --> 18:14.240
yeah, you know, or like.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.160
I'd love to see that thing.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.000
I'm wild about that.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.640
Yeah, I mean, or like a service animal.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.480
I guess that's cool too.

18:18.480 --> 18:21.760
We all wanna see Toby's big boa constrictor,

18:21.760 --> 18:22.800
but he doesn't bring them around

18:22.800 --> 18:24.480
except at parties and picnics.

18:24.480 --> 18:27.320
Well, cause the boa constrictor doesn't like pizza.

18:27.320 --> 18:32.200
Cause it can't, they like ball shaped stuff

18:32.200 --> 18:33.580
that they can eat, you know?

18:33.580 --> 18:38.200
So they love calzones, or just like a ball of dough.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.460
But you know, old man Pizza Tony

18:40.460 --> 18:41.760
won't give him a ball of dough,

18:41.760 --> 18:43.880
cause he hates aminals.

18:43.880 --> 18:44.840
Yeah.

18:44.840 --> 18:48.360
Don't let, I don't think we should let seagulls in it.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.640
I tell you, we guys hate more birds or mice.

18:51.640 --> 18:52.480
Birds.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.480
Mice.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.720
All right, well, I'll have to hate them equally.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.280
It's very rare that I have to worry

18:59.280 --> 19:01.120
about a mouse hitting me in the face.

19:01.120 --> 19:05.320
Sure, let's sympathize though for a second,

19:05.320 --> 19:08.520
because what happens if you do walk into the pizza place,

19:08.520 --> 19:11.080
you do let just a huge fucking seagull.

19:11.080 --> 19:16.080
And some of these birds guys, they get awfully big.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.720
And so they get into the pizza place

19:18.720 --> 19:21.080
and they're scooping up pepperoni rolls and garlic knots

19:21.080 --> 19:24.440
and just like mouthing them down in one go.

19:24.440 --> 19:27.280
And the manager gets mad at you and starts yelling at you.

19:27.280 --> 19:30.160
And it's like, hey, this is my pizza place.

19:30.160 --> 19:31.400
You've let a big bird in here.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.120
How did you handle that energy?

19:33.120 --> 19:37.920
You say, this seagull is rich.

19:37.920 --> 19:38.760
Oh, yeah.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.840
And like you're their driver, you know,

19:40.840 --> 19:42.160
you open the door cause they can't.

19:42.160 --> 19:46.080
And then like the seagull pulls out its wallet

19:46.080 --> 19:50.120
and like shames the shit out of old man pizza, Tony.

19:50.120 --> 19:53.040
So there's one problem is that they won't be able to,

19:53.040 --> 19:54.720
you could pull out the seagulls wallet

19:54.720 --> 19:57.360
and be like, I carry the seagulls wallet for them.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.560
You understand Trav that a bird can't pull a wallet out.

19:59.560 --> 20:02.360
You're sounding a lot like old man pizza, Tony Griffin.

20:02.360 --> 20:07.280
How far do you take this?

20:07.280 --> 20:12.120
Like the bird, oh no, this isn't my wallet.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.280
It's the bird's wallet.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.000
You see, I work for the bird

20:15.000 --> 20:17.140
and anytime they talk to your face,

20:17.140 --> 20:19.560
like please, please address the bird.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.080
Please address the bird.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.020
It drives him crazy when you talk to me

20:23.020 --> 20:25.320
like you're talking to him, please.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.920
Then you open the door and a pelican flies in

20:27.920 --> 20:30.020
and you're like, this is the bird's best friend.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.720
And he invited him out for a pizza lunch.

20:32.720 --> 20:33.560
You're embarrassing me.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.400
He's also rich.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.000
He's also really, really rich.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.440
They're so fucking rich.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.080
The pelican carries his own wallet

20:39.080 --> 20:42.280
because he's got that big, warbly mouth.

20:42.280 --> 20:45.560
So what, the seagull's gonna pay for them both?

20:45.560 --> 20:49.880
No, no, no, the pelican will pick up the tab.

20:49.880 --> 20:50.720
The seagull paid last time.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.400
Have you ever gone to lunch with a friend?

20:52.400 --> 20:53.480
What's wrong with you?

20:53.480 --> 20:55.100
Come on, dude.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.840
This job's for the birds.

20:58.440 --> 20:59.360
What job?

20:59.360 --> 21:00.200
Bird job?

21:00.200 --> 21:01.040
Yeah.

21:01.040 --> 21:01.880
Yeah, okay, yeah, okay, I love it.

21:01.880 --> 21:05.120
As the bird, like, translator.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.160
God, fucking holy shit, guys.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.960
That was my best joke yet.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.520
And you guys didn't like it.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.640
That was my best joke yet.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.040
I'm gonna get tweets like, hey Griffin,

21:13.040 --> 21:15.620
great episode, best joke yet on this one.

21:15.620 --> 21:17.520
And you guys didn't even like it.

21:17.520 --> 21:18.960
And I thought you were really gonna like it.

21:18.960 --> 21:19.800
I thought you were gonna laugh really.

21:19.800 --> 21:20.620
Do you wanna try it again?

21:20.620 --> 21:21.800
No, I don't wanna try it again.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.760
I just, I thought you were gonna laugh really hard at it

21:23.760 --> 21:25.020
and you didn't like it.

21:25.020 --> 21:27.560
Could you let in an animal

21:27.560 --> 21:29.760
that is a natural enemy of the seagull

21:29.760 --> 21:31.640
as a recompense for your misdeeds?

21:31.640 --> 21:32.880
Like an octopus?

21:32.880 --> 21:36.040
Could you let in an octopus to fight the seagull

21:36.040 --> 21:36.880
and take him out?

21:36.880 --> 21:40.000
Oh, but then what if that octopus's translator's there

21:40.000 --> 21:41.560
and it's like, this octopus is rich.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.640
And then old man Pete's attorney has to decide

21:43.640 --> 21:44.840
which one to kick out.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.120
He's a pacifist.

21:46.120 --> 21:49.960
He's rich, this octopus is rich,

21:49.960 --> 21:52.000
and he hates fighting people.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
And this octopus and the seagull actually have

21:55.000 --> 21:56.960
like a Romeo and Juliet star-crossed lovers

21:56.960 --> 21:59.880
kind of thing going on, and it simply cannot be.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.120
I mean, you got a little old lady

22:01.120 --> 22:02.560
who saw the fly situation,

22:02.560 --> 22:05.360
which, I guess my problem with the little old lady

22:05.360 --> 22:07.640
who swallowed the fly situation.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.000
Light her up.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.040
At some point, don't you gotta just kinda stop?

22:13.040 --> 22:14.560
Don't you gotta stop?

22:14.560 --> 22:16.280
Like you swallowed a dog to get the cat

22:16.280 --> 22:19.220
and you gotta be like, I swallowed a dog, I'm done.

22:19.220 --> 22:20.060
I'm done.

22:20.060 --> 22:22.000
Swallowing the cat was really hard.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
The cat was tough.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.440
The cat was tough to get down sort of physically

22:25.440 --> 22:27.640
and emotionally and ethically.

22:27.640 --> 22:30.760
And then I tried to do a dog and I got there,

22:30.760 --> 22:32.440
and I think I just gotta walk away

22:32.440 --> 22:33.680
because there's not too many.

22:33.680 --> 22:34.680
First of all, what am I gonna,

22:34.680 --> 22:36.360
I'm gonna swallow a horse to get the dog,

22:36.360 --> 22:37.600
and that doesn't even make sense

22:37.600 --> 22:39.680
because the horses don't eat dog,

22:39.680 --> 22:41.520
like they're not natural predators.

22:41.520 --> 22:46.520
You can't, it's like, it is like I swallowed a dog

22:47.440 --> 22:51.440
and it's in me, and I guess that that's it.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.280
That is the end of it, is I have swallowed the dog

22:54.280 --> 22:57.680
and the situation is at least contained to me.

22:57.680 --> 23:01.040
I have more roads open to me, vis-a-vis a horse,

23:01.040 --> 23:03.680
but I just really, really,

23:03.680 --> 23:06.880
I really think that's a bridge too far, even for me.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.800
I tell you, the real problem with the little old lady

23:09.800 --> 23:11.480
who swallowed a fly story,

23:11.480 --> 23:13.660
and this is the reason I'm not buying it,

23:13.660 --> 23:17.200
is whoever the bystander is who's observing this

23:17.200 --> 23:22.200
and ruminating that perhaps this old lady will die.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.020
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

23:23.020 --> 23:25.280
Hasn't taken the two seconds it would take

23:25.280 --> 23:28.200
to explain to this old lady how digestion works.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.640
Yeah, you're gonna.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.100
She doesn't need to worry about it.

23:31.100 --> 23:31.940
Yeah.

23:31.940 --> 23:32.840
The fly's long dead.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.860
That fly's done. That fly is so dead.

23:34.860 --> 23:37.120
You're so fine, little old lady.

23:37.120 --> 23:40.000
But see, this is the problem with today's YouTube culture

23:40.000 --> 23:42.080
is that they are filming it for their channels.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.600
They're gonna put it on the vine

23:43.600 --> 23:45.080
and they're gonna put it on their YouTube channels

23:45.080 --> 23:46.580
and they're gonna get a lot of subscribers.

23:46.580 --> 23:48.120
This woman swallowed nine animals.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.080
It's great.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.160
Please like this. Hey, this is Brofist69.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.520
I'm doing the little old lady challenge today.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.360
Uh-oh.

23:54.360 --> 23:55.200
Uh-oh.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.020
Uh-oh.

23:56.020 --> 23:56.860
Uh-oh.

23:56.860 --> 23:57.700
Uh-oh.

23:57.700 --> 23:58.520
All right, here we go.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.360
Fly first.

23:59.360 --> 24:00.960
Oh!

24:00.960 --> 24:01.840
I went to a pet store

24:01.840 --> 24:03.360
where they don't ask any questions.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.200
Let's go.

24:05.200 --> 24:08.040
I don't know why she swallowed the fly.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.500
I guess for the vine.

24:12.500 --> 24:13.660
Hey, it's me, the old lady.

24:13.660 --> 24:14.760
I'm back again.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.440
And today I'm swallowing the sickest shit yet.

24:17.440 --> 24:18.280
Yeah.

24:18.280 --> 24:19.100
Film this.

24:20.280 --> 24:22.200
I wanna know in case anything happens to me,

24:22.200 --> 24:24.840
I'll leave everything to my great grandmother

24:24.840 --> 24:25.960
who's still alive.

24:28.640 --> 24:30.920
And she's been swallowing her whole life.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.080
It's for you, Gam-Gam.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.040
Today I'm gonna swallow the Constitution.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.660
Don't at me.

24:36.660 --> 24:38.320
Today I'm swallowing the Predator

24:38.320 --> 24:40.200
to get the human I ate last week.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.120
But that's it,

24:42.120 --> 24:42.960
cause nothing,

24:42.960 --> 24:45.080
and then I'm gonna get Danny Glover in there.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.440
But then that's it.

24:46.440 --> 24:47.800
Nothing can,

24:47.800 --> 24:48.640
that's the end of it.

24:48.640 --> 24:49.460
Nothing.

24:49.460 --> 24:50.300
Nothing left.

24:50.300 --> 24:51.120
It's the end of the whole thing.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.560
I've eaten everything that I can do.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.360
And then I'm gonna start streaming.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.200
Hello, Brad.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.600
And then the stream will begin.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.320
I'm trying to consume Danny Glover.

25:01.320 --> 25:02.440
Maybe Fortnite?

25:02.440 --> 25:03.280
I don't know.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.340
Today I'm playing Fortnite.

25:04.340 --> 25:09.080
And I'm all fucked up on Danny Glover energy.

25:09.080 --> 25:13.000
I'm really full and I'm fucked up on it.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.520
It made me feel crazy.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.320
I'm getting the best headshots of my life right now.

25:18.320 --> 25:21.960
And I have to eat Danny Glover before every stream.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.280
I've never played Fortnite,

25:23.280 --> 25:25.640
but Danny Glover is quite proficient at it.

25:25.640 --> 25:28.080
And he's in there sort of controlling the gizmos

25:28.080 --> 25:29.860
and gears like a meat, Dave.

25:30.760 --> 25:34.520
How many spoonfuls of Nutella can I steal from the pantry

25:34.520 --> 25:36.540
before my roommate notices?

25:36.540 --> 25:39.400
The jar's about six inches tall from memory.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.640
Can't go measure right now,

25:40.640 --> 25:42.120
cause he'll see me.

25:42.120 --> 25:45.560
That's from the Nutella Bandit in North Carolina.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.520
I picture you like in a closet right now

25:47.520 --> 25:49.880
whispering this into your iPhone.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.320
Yeah, right.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.280
Activate speed tracking.

25:53.280 --> 25:58.000
Is there anything better than a fucking food heist, y'all?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.800
Is there anything?

25:59.800 --> 26:04.800
I do this literally every day where I go into the kitchen,

26:04.840 --> 26:07.480
maybe me and Rachel are playing with Henry

26:07.480 --> 26:09.280
and I go in the kitchen and get a glass of water

26:09.280 --> 26:11.080
and I think, you know what would be good right now?

26:11.080 --> 26:12.840
Also a secret Oreo.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.680
And so I just kind of dig down and I'm like,

26:14.680 --> 26:17.320
oh, where's my, where's the,

26:17.320 --> 26:19.820
hey, hey babe, where's the nails?

26:21.920 --> 26:24.880
But I like get them, I get the Oreos instead of the nails.

26:24.880 --> 26:25.960
The nails?

26:25.960 --> 26:27.760
Yeah. The nails.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.280
When I babysat, I babysat for a summer,

26:30.280 --> 26:32.080
two summers actually when I was living in Huntington,

26:32.080 --> 26:35.200
and that family always had Gushers

26:35.200 --> 26:36.960
and they were the kids Gushers,

26:36.960 --> 26:39.800
but I made them mine because of my actions.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.200
The Smurls at their new house

26:44.200 --> 26:45.320
that they've lived in for a while,

26:45.320 --> 26:46.640
of course they always had like,

26:46.640 --> 26:48.280
cause Riley was just growing up,

26:48.280 --> 26:50.560
they always had great kid treats.

26:50.560 --> 26:54.280
Their pantry was, you had to go through the guest bathroom

26:54.280 --> 26:55.680
to get into the pantry.

26:55.680 --> 26:59.000
Oops-a-daisy, did you just let me lock the door?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.860
I can like, I can get rid of fucking fingerprints, y'all.

27:01.860 --> 27:05.040
Like it is the perfect, it is the perfect crime.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.880
Are you sure you want to leave me?

27:06.880 --> 27:09.280
Justin's been in the bathroom for four hours.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.680
Yeah, he has.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.400
He's scrubbing the plates.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.080
Sticky from Gushers.

27:14.080 --> 27:18.440
I, when I was a kid, man, I've never felt as guilty.

27:18.440 --> 27:19.360
Well, that's not true,

27:19.360 --> 27:22.240
but this is one of the things I feel very guilty about.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.320
I used to steal mom and dad's Weight Watcher desserts.

27:25.320 --> 27:26.520
Oh, me too, bud.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.920
Ah, sick.

27:27.920 --> 27:31.080
Because I feel guilty because I was like 12

27:31.080 --> 27:33.560
and literally could have eaten straight lard

27:33.560 --> 27:34.680
and been fine.

27:34.680 --> 27:35.520
Yes.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.120
But it was the very idea of mom and dad

27:37.120 --> 27:39.960
would bring them home and say, don't eat these.

27:39.960 --> 27:40.840
And then I would think like,

27:40.840 --> 27:42.520
well, I'm definitely going to do that then.

27:42.520 --> 27:43.360
I got to.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.320
And I would always like try to figure out like,

27:45.320 --> 27:47.040
okay, well there's four in a box.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.760
They've had one.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.500
So the box is already open.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.000
So if I take one, maybe mom will think dad did it

27:53.000 --> 27:54.560
and dad will think mom did it.

27:54.560 --> 27:55.400
Ah, yum, yum, yum, yum.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.720
And that's why our parents got divorced.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.600
Oh, that's not funny.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.080
This is what is integral about this question.

28:02.080 --> 28:07.080
And then this is the key fucking part of a food heist is,

28:09.200 --> 28:10.960
well, you need motive and opportunity.

28:10.960 --> 28:14.400
The motive is, I mean, a snack down.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.440
And the opportunity is however you can get

28:16.440 --> 28:17.640
in the kitchen alone.

28:17.640 --> 28:18.920
But then there's a math.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.080
There's a math to it.

28:20.080 --> 28:22.800
There's a Indiana Jones replacing the idol

28:22.800 --> 28:23.720
with the bag of sand.

28:23.720 --> 28:24.840
You got it, you got it.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.880
There has to be a stealth aspect

28:27.880 --> 28:29.200
of they don't even know it's gone.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.920
And this is how they,

28:30.920 --> 28:33.080
is there an amount of Nutella they could take that is-

28:33.080 --> 28:36.960
There are some stages at which you cannot eat the Nutella.

28:36.960 --> 28:37.800
Sure.

28:37.800 --> 28:41.840
Here, like the primary stage is it's closed, it's sealed.

28:41.840 --> 28:42.680
Fresh jar.

28:42.680 --> 28:43.840
You definitely will notice the difference

28:43.840 --> 28:46.720
between unopened Nutella and open Nutella.

28:46.720 --> 28:47.780
That's huge.

28:47.780 --> 28:51.520
There is also another bite that is completely off limits

28:51.520 --> 28:52.920
and that's it.

28:52.920 --> 28:55.440
That's the bottom of it, the end.

28:55.440 --> 28:56.560
If you have the last bite

28:56.560 --> 28:58.480
and leave an empty Nutella jar in there,

28:58.480 --> 29:00.240
that's the biggest difference, I think,

29:00.240 --> 29:01.080
basically in the world.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.880
Because you've taken the person from like,

29:02.880 --> 29:05.680
I have Nutella, to I have no Nutella.

29:05.680 --> 29:06.640
That's massive.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.240
The other thing you can't do though,

29:08.240 --> 29:09.600
and you have to be very careful about this,

29:09.600 --> 29:11.600
if they've tucked in the jar already,

29:11.600 --> 29:14.640
you can't take the person from,

29:14.640 --> 29:16.120
I have plenty of Nutella.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.560
I don't even have to think about Nutella for a while,

29:18.560 --> 29:22.040
to, dang, I'm kind of running low on Nutella.

29:22.040 --> 29:24.600
Because they will feel that as well.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.360
You cannot make that change.

29:26.360 --> 29:29.480
You have to leave them feeling fat and happy

29:29.480 --> 29:30.840
as vis-a-vis Nutella.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.400
Okay, wait, I have a suggestion.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.880
You could also though, you could leave them,

29:34.880 --> 29:37.880
if they are already at, oh, I'm running low on Nutella,

29:37.880 --> 29:39.880
you could still have a couple scooper rolls

29:39.880 --> 29:42.480
and they'll still be like, I'm running, yeah, I'm staying.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.280
I really need to go to the store.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.480
I'm really running low.

29:45.480 --> 29:48.240
It can't be 100, it can't be 50, or it can't be 0%.

29:48.240 --> 29:53.240
You operate in the gray area between those checkpoints.

29:53.880 --> 29:54.920
Here's what you do.

29:54.920 --> 29:58.000
Every time your roommate has some Nutella,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.160
and once they leave the room, they leave the kitchen,

30:00.160 --> 30:03.080
you go in and you're gonna get yourself 10%

30:03.080 --> 30:06.480
of however much Nutella they just had, right?

30:06.480 --> 30:09.880
Because most likely, because what you can't do

30:09.880 --> 30:12.200
is like, they don't have Nutella for a week

30:12.200 --> 30:14.560
and you keep kind of skimming a little bit,

30:14.560 --> 30:16.080
they might notice that.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.720
But if every time there's just a little bit more missing

30:18.720 --> 30:21.240
than when they had it, either that,

30:21.240 --> 30:24.480
or you need to mix some mud in there to re-expel it.

30:24.480 --> 30:25.320
Some muddy in there.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.760
A little bit of mud. Get it back in.

30:26.760 --> 30:27.600
And once I said that.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.480
It's not as good as it used to be when I was a kid.

30:29.480 --> 30:32.280
I realized you could have maybe done like peanut butter

30:32.280 --> 30:34.480
and I said mud, but like, where are you gonna get

30:34.480 --> 30:35.600
peanut butter? Oh, this is, no,

30:35.600 --> 30:36.800
this is great, Travis.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.280
So you tuck a little peanut butter in there with the Nutella

30:39.280 --> 30:40.600
and then you get out a Sharpie

30:40.600 --> 30:42.160
and in your very best handwriting,

30:42.160 --> 30:45.080
you write now with peanut butter on the label.

30:45.080 --> 30:47.880
And you try and make it look super, super, super a fish.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.760
And the people come back and be like,

30:49.760 --> 30:51.720
I don't remember, I have a peanut allergy

30:51.720 --> 30:52.920
and I tucked into this.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.160
And you'd be like, huh, better go to a hospital.

30:55.160 --> 30:57.040
I'll keep an eye on your Nutella.

30:57.040 --> 30:59.440
I guess you don't really have a peanut allergy then.

30:59.440 --> 31:00.960
Yeah, find out what they're allergic to

31:00.960 --> 31:02.400
and tuck some of that in there.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.840
So you can be like Nutella, now with cucumbers.

31:04.840 --> 31:06.240
And you write that on the label and they'd be like,

31:06.240 --> 31:08.120
oh shoot, I didn't notice this when I bought it.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.400
Oh well, do you want to eat all this?

31:09.400 --> 31:13.800
And you say, you're already eaten it.

31:13.800 --> 31:17.520
Or you could invite the person from like across the hall

31:17.520 --> 31:19.800
over just for like a couple of minutes

31:19.800 --> 31:22.760
and then they're gone, but so's the Nutella.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.600
I love the secret ingredient thing.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.360
All you need to do in your whole life

31:26.360 --> 31:30.120
is always carry with you a tube of toothpaste

31:30.120 --> 31:33.680
and a sticker that says now with more toothpaste.

31:33.680 --> 31:37.880
And you can basically eat anything you want at any time.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.600
You just relabel it.

31:39.600 --> 31:43.240
You've squeezed some toothpaste in to cover your tracks

31:43.240 --> 31:44.840
and then you slap that sticker on there.

31:44.840 --> 31:45.680
You're done.

31:45.680 --> 31:46.500
That's really good.

31:46.500 --> 31:50.720
Travis's idea was promising of bringing in a ringer.

31:50.720 --> 31:54.480
And what I like is you can really play it up

31:54.480 --> 31:56.840
and be like, this is my old friend,

31:56.840 --> 31:59.400
Stellan the sticky chocolate boy.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.360
And he was a foreign exchange student,

32:01.360 --> 32:02.440
stayed with my family for two years.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.280
We love Stellan and almost as much

32:04.280 --> 32:05.640
as he loves sticky chocolate.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.200
And y'all hang out for a bit,

32:07.200 --> 32:09.360
watch the Big Bang Theory or whatever.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.560
And then when Stellan leaves,

32:10.560 --> 32:13.000
the bottle of Nutella is gone and it's in your bedroom.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.480
But your roommate's like, what the fuck?

32:15.480 --> 32:16.600
You'd be like, oh, I should have told you.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.520
That's one thing about Stellan.

32:18.520 --> 32:19.800
He'll get that chocolate, man.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.560
It's not even a question.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.640
Don't worry, he won't be over here again.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.120
No, we won't invite him again.

32:25.120 --> 32:28.320
Okay, do we need another person for this?

32:28.320 --> 32:31.520
Or do you just need a very good disguise?

32:32.440 --> 32:36.520
Hello, hello, it's me, Stellan.

32:36.520 --> 32:40.560
I'm here, do not leave me near our chocolate.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.880
It is a warning, and they will.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.160
Kitchen inspection.

32:46.160 --> 32:50.040
Maybe I am French, maybe I'm Belgian, it's hard to tell.

32:50.040 --> 32:53.000
Do not mind the sticky chocolate on my head,

32:53.000 --> 32:57.760
and fingers, and face, and mouth, and cheeks.

32:57.760 --> 33:01.080
Au revoir, a bientot.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.040
Man, that dude didn't cross my front door,

33:04.040 --> 33:05.440
but I feel like he stole my Nutella.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.320
Yep, he did, damn it.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.280
God almighty, he's good.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.760
Or we just take all these ideas

33:10.760 --> 33:13.480
and maybe the simplest option is just slap a sticker on there

33:13.480 --> 33:15.400
that says, now with less Nutella.

33:15.400 --> 33:20.160
I mean, the other thing you could do is like,

33:20.160 --> 33:21.280
hey, movie night.

33:21.280 --> 33:22.880
And they're like, hell yeah.

33:22.880 --> 33:26.360
And then you put in The Predators.

33:26.360 --> 33:28.160
And then you're sitting there and you're watching it

33:28.160 --> 33:29.840
and you'd be like, hey,

33:29.840 --> 33:31.560
do you wanna eat some of that Nutella?

33:31.560 --> 33:32.960
And they're like, oh, that's a good idea.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.360
And so they'll start eating the Nutella

33:34.360 --> 33:37.200
and be like, hey, let me get a scooper roll.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.800
And then all of a sudden it's not a crime,

33:38.800 --> 33:40.240
it's like a friendship activity.

33:40.240 --> 33:42.440
But you know, it is still a crime.

33:42.440 --> 33:43.280
I love that.

33:43.280 --> 33:46.080
Hey, y'all mind if we take a brief sojourn

33:46.080 --> 33:46.920
to the Money Zone?

33:46.920 --> 33:49.200
I would love that more than anything in the whole world.

33:49.200 --> 33:54.200
You know how I like to start my day?

34:03.440 --> 34:07.240
I slide it all into a pair of me undies.

34:07.240 --> 34:08.760
Wait, what's all of it?

34:08.760 --> 34:09.600
All of it.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.640
All the goods.

34:11.640 --> 34:13.040
And I slide them into.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.740
Like your butt and everything?

34:15.880 --> 34:18.640
As you're hearing this, I've had a vasectomy

34:18.640 --> 34:21.680
and boy was I happy to be able to slide on.

34:21.680 --> 34:23.340
And boy are my arms tired.

34:25.560 --> 34:28.440
These micro modal fabrics are the best place

34:28.440 --> 34:29.560
to put all of it.

34:29.560 --> 34:32.240
They release multiple fun prints each month,

34:32.240 --> 34:35.560
me undies does, in matching socks and bralettes.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.520
Hey, thank you Justin for specifying

34:38.520 --> 34:43.120
that it's not your bits that release fun matching prints.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.200
That means a lot to me.

34:44.200 --> 34:45.040
Thank you for clarifying.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.840
If your bits release fun matching prints,

34:46.840 --> 34:49.200
please see a doctor as soon as you can.

34:59.760 --> 35:01.120
It's already the highest level it could be.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.040
It's your top drawer.

35:02.040 --> 35:03.240
You know what I'm saying?

35:03.240 --> 35:05.320
Why do you have no next to top drawer?

35:05.320 --> 35:06.240
No, see.

35:26.520 --> 35:29.240
I want to tell y'all about Boll and Branch.

35:30.120 --> 35:33.160

35:33.160 --> 35:38.160
soft, luxurious, loving things.

35:38.520 --> 35:41.600
And those things include bedding and blankets,

35:41.600 --> 35:44.360
and they are made from 100% pure,

35:44.360 --> 35:49.360
the finest organic cotton, which means they start out

35:50.240 --> 35:54.260
super soft and they get even softer as time goes on.

35:54.260 --> 35:56.320
And you're going to get older,

35:56.320 --> 35:59.600
but these beddings never will.

35:59.600 --> 36:00.760
Wait, no, no.

36:00.760 --> 36:02.400
It doesn't say that at all, Griffin.

36:02.400 --> 36:03.240
It says that.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.320
It says they're chrono time-locked.

36:05.320 --> 36:09.000
And that you're going to get older,

36:09.000 --> 36:12.160
but they wash these sheets in the Tuck Everlasting Springs.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.400
So they're going to be forever, forever young.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.600
And they have thousands of five-star reviews.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.880
Forbes, Wall Street Journal, and Fast Company

36:18.880 --> 36:20.960
are all talking about these Everlasting

36:20.960 --> 36:22.600
Boll and Branch bedding items.

36:22.600 --> 36:23.680
And the shipping is free.

36:23.680 --> 36:24.520
You can have them.

36:24.520 --> 36:26.600
You can try them for 30 nights if you don't love them.

36:26.600 --> 36:27.920
Then you send them back for a refund,

36:27.920 --> 36:29.760
but you're not going to want to do that

36:29.760 --> 36:32.600
because of how fucking soft and immortal they are.

36:32.600 --> 36:33.680
So to get started right now,

36:33.680 --> 36:36.640
our listeners can get $50 off your first set of sheets.

36:36.640 --> 36:39.280
Ooh, it's a fun twister, isn't it?

36:39.280 --> 36:40.600
Oh, geez.

36:40.600 --> 36:44.640
50 cents, $50 off your first set of sheets.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.760
Gosh, he got me.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.240
My brother, BollandBranch.com promo code, my brother.

37:02.240 --> 37:05.920
I would like to, I got a personal message here,

37:05.920 --> 37:10.600
and it's for Jet Sam, Rivian Chillstep,

37:10.600 --> 37:13.720
Ernest P Braxton, and Mudd.

37:13.720 --> 37:17.560
And it's from Felicia Silvertongue.

37:17.560 --> 37:20.520
Thank you for ushering me into the world of tabletop gaming

37:20.520 --> 37:22.180
and into the McElroy universe.

37:22.180 --> 37:24.380
My life has become infinitely better

37:24.380 --> 37:27.200
since we joined forces on our first campaign.

37:27.200 --> 37:30.640
I'm so glad we could take on Nashville to see the brothers,

37:30.640 --> 37:32.640
search for the quintessential meatball,

37:32.640 --> 37:34.720
and meet Mayor Kobe Bryant.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.400
Stay strong, Denim Warriors.

37:37.400 --> 37:42.400
I need to know how much of this happened in the real world

37:42.440 --> 37:43.280
and how much of it is it?

37:43.280 --> 37:44.560
What was the Tom Hanks movie

37:44.560 --> 37:47.360
where he got like so into his D&D campaign

37:47.360 --> 37:48.440
that he like went into a cave

37:48.440 --> 37:50.320
and tried to do like spells and shit?

37:50.320 --> 37:51.160
Do you know what I'm talking about?

37:51.160 --> 37:51.980
Wizard of the Warrior?

37:51.980 --> 37:52.820
Wizard of the Warriors?

37:52.820 --> 37:53.640
Do you know what I'm talking about?

37:53.640 --> 37:54.860
I'm worried that this is that

37:54.860 --> 37:57.680
because I don't know if Mayor Kobe Bryant

37:57.680 --> 38:00.540
is like a major, major, major news item

38:00.540 --> 38:01.880
that I missed out on.

38:01.880 --> 38:02.720
It's possible.

38:02.720 --> 38:03.720
Here's the thing.

38:03.720 --> 38:06.420
The thing that's messed up about maybe my brain

38:06.420 --> 38:08.520
and I think collectively all of our brains,

38:08.520 --> 38:11.140
all of these jokes, like the quintessential meatball,

38:11.140 --> 38:12.660
Mayor Kobe Bryant, Denim Warrior,

38:12.660 --> 38:15.560
we could have said these in the Nashville episode.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.640
Oh, fuck yeah.

38:16.640 --> 38:19.600
But like I have no, that's all sent up to the cloud now.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.440
I have no idea.

38:20.440 --> 38:21.280
You're just saying so many jokes.

38:21.280 --> 38:22.920
That's in the cloud actually.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.460
How about this next Jumbotron, Justin?

38:26.400 --> 38:27.720
Yeah, you know it.

38:27.720 --> 38:29.200
Don't even test me.

38:30.760 --> 38:33.480
It is a message for the Islanders

38:33.480 --> 38:35.540
and it's from Jason AB and it says,

38:35.540 --> 38:38.560
Dear Islanders, ever since joining the group,

38:38.560 --> 38:40.360
I have met so many wonderful people.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.680
Every day brings joy to my life

38:41.680 --> 38:43.680
and interacting with you all has made me

38:43.680 --> 38:46.120
a more confident and better person.

38:46.120 --> 38:49.440
Here's to more meetups, selfies, jokes, and friends

38:49.440 --> 38:51.640
and helping each other navigate through life.

38:51.640 --> 38:56.560
I can't wait to meet more of you in real space.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.480
Is there a chance that this message

38:58.480 --> 39:01.180
is for the New York Islanders hockey team?

39:01.180 --> 39:03.400
Y'all have really made me feel a part of the team

39:03.400 --> 39:07.200
because I am on it and thanks

39:07.200 --> 39:09.680
for batting the old puck around.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.780
I can't wait to meet you.

39:11.780 --> 39:13.200
No pucking around.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.760
I wish I could meet the rest of the team.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.120
But you won't let me.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.160
I'm only allowed to meet one of you at a time

39:19.160 --> 39:22.080
in case it doesn't work out.

39:22.080 --> 39:23.640
Here's one more Gumbo Trom.

39:23.640 --> 39:26.880
This one is for Future Sara from Past Sara

39:26.880 --> 39:28.440
who says, Happy Birthday.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.280
You did it.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.640
You survived a year in Florida

39:30.640 --> 39:32.320
and you're about to move back to Texas

39:32.320 --> 39:33.600
where you know you belong.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.800
I don't know if you're in Austin or Defebure,

39:36.800 --> 39:38.040
which I believe is Dallas, Fort Worth,

39:38.040 --> 39:40.480
but what matters is you're back in the Lone Star State

39:40.480 --> 39:41.400
with your friends and family.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.160
Past you is proud and a little jealous.

39:43.160 --> 39:44.440
Okay, a lot jealous.

39:44.440 --> 39:47.720
Enjoy that dry heat and barbecue.

39:47.720 --> 39:50.960
And it seems like this happened this past summer.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.200
Congratulations, Sara.

39:52.200 --> 39:53.160
Welcome back.

39:53.160 --> 39:55.800
And like we say here in Texas,

39:55.800 --> 39:57.740
we left a light on for you.

39:58.920 --> 40:01.160
Hello, are you looking for a new comedy podcast?

40:01.160 --> 40:03.040
In which case, can I draw your attention

40:03.040 --> 40:05.840
to the Beef and Dairy Network podcast?

40:05.840 --> 40:07.600
It's a fictional industry podcast

40:07.600 --> 40:09.940
for the beef and dairy industries.

40:09.940 --> 40:13.540
It won Best Comedy at the 2017 British Podcast Awards

40:13.540 --> 40:16.760
and it features wonderful guests such as Greg Davis.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.440
To my knowledge, it's the only cow circus

40:18.440 --> 40:20.960
that's ever existed in this country.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.200
In rural Russia, every small town has a cow circus.

40:24.200 --> 40:25.300
Josie Long.

40:25.300 --> 40:26.540
You should have a beef.

40:26.540 --> 40:27.880
Have a beef with them.

40:27.880 --> 40:28.880
I have a beef with you.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.480
I will have a beef with you.

40:30.480 --> 40:33.400
Come round my house and I'll have a beef with you.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.440
And Andy Daly.

40:34.440 --> 40:35.880
That virus never existed.

40:35.880 --> 40:38.480
There was never any such thing as a mad cow disease.

40:38.480 --> 40:43.080
That was all an illusion that Big Lamb came up with.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.040
That's the Beef and Dairy Network podcast.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.200
Find us at MaximumFun.org

40:47.200 --> 40:49.480
or wherever you get your podcasts from.

40:49.480 --> 40:52.540
And I would recommend starting at episode one.

40:52.540 --> 40:53.380
Bye.

40:54.400 --> 40:57.020
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

40:57.020 --> 40:58.480
Yeah. Yeah.

40:58.480 --> 41:01.560
This is kind of a new segment idea that I have

41:01.560 --> 41:02.840
and I'm gonna bounce it off y'all

41:02.840 --> 41:04.840
and if it goes over like a real lead balloon,

41:04.840 --> 41:06.880
then I'll put it right back in the toilet.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.520
It's sent in by Graham Roebuck.

41:09.520 --> 41:10.400
Thank you, Graham.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.920
So I'm an anonymous Yahoo Answers user,

41:11.920 --> 41:13.120
but I'm gonna call him.

41:13.120 --> 41:18.120
Let's just, Sturm asks,

41:19.960 --> 41:23.620
will the Marine Corps check my tattoo in detail?

41:25.040 --> 41:27.680
Long story short, I have this tattoo that I don't like.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.320
It's not going to be offensive by military standards,

41:30.320 --> 41:34.920
but it is, how should I say this, a little embarrassing.

41:34.920 --> 41:37.080
I once went to the place to get a tat on my back.

41:37.080 --> 41:39.160
I picked out a real beauty, an American Eagle,

41:39.160 --> 41:40.420
really awesome.

41:40.420 --> 41:43.880
Anyhow, I get it done and I see it in the mirror afterwards.

41:43.880 --> 41:45.000
I noticed there's some words

41:45.000 --> 41:46.440
in the circle surrounding the Eagle.

41:46.440 --> 41:49.440
The words are small and I can't make it out

41:49.440 --> 41:51.680
because the mirror makes everything look reversed.

41:51.680 --> 41:54.680
The artist guy says it reads All American Spirit.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.560
Okay, cool.

41:55.560 --> 41:58.340
I didn't ask for lettering, but it's a nice bonus.

41:58.340 --> 42:00.240
Three weeks later, I'm playing basketball

42:00.240 --> 42:01.480
with a bunch of guys.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.560
It's four on four at the park court.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.480
We do shirts and skins.

42:05.480 --> 42:06.600
I am a skin.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.200
So this guy reads my tattoos.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.480
We're taking a break.

42:09.480 --> 42:11.560
He really busts out laughing.

42:11.560 --> 42:14.020
Can't figure out why he's laughing at an Eagle.

42:14.020 --> 42:15.920
My friend comes over and starts laughing too.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.380
I say, what is so funny?

42:17.380 --> 42:19.600
They tell me what the tattoo says.

42:19.600 --> 42:22.740
Turns out it doesn't say All American Spirit.

42:22.740 --> 42:25.200
It actually says, I love to masturbate.

42:25.200 --> 42:26.440
Can you believe it?

42:28.600 --> 42:30.160
Update, so I go home.

42:30.160 --> 42:32.760
I still can't believe my uncle is there.

42:32.760 --> 42:33.880
So I asked him to read it.

42:33.880 --> 42:36.280
He confirms that it says, I love to masturbate.

42:36.280 --> 42:37.960
I still think it is some type of joke.

42:37.960 --> 42:41.440
So I ask my sister, she says the same thing.

42:41.440 --> 42:44.620
Update two, I look in the mirror with a big magnifier.

42:47.660 --> 42:49.580
Sure enough, they are right.

42:49.580 --> 42:51.720
The guy, sure enough, they are right.

42:51.720 --> 42:54.640
The guy really printed those words on my back.

42:54.640 --> 42:58.240
Update three, later my uncle says, wait a minute.

42:58.240 --> 43:00.440
Did you go to Ed's to have that done?

43:00.440 --> 43:01.880
It's not.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.360
Wait a minute, did you go to Ed's to have that done?

43:04.360 --> 43:06.700
I say, yeah, so what?

43:06.700 --> 43:08.280
My uncle tells me about the run

43:08.280 --> 43:10.400
and he had with Ed a few months ago.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.360
Ed told my uncle that he would get him back

43:12.360 --> 43:14.380
one way or another.

43:14.380 --> 43:16.860
Update four, Ed said, I don't know how,

43:16.860 --> 43:21.200
but I will get you or your nephew or one of your relatives.

43:21.200 --> 43:23.840
My uncle confirms that Ed fucked me over

43:23.840 --> 43:26.280
because of my uncle's dispute.

43:26.280 --> 43:27.880
Update five, so my uncle and me

43:27.880 --> 43:29.480
go down to Ed's tattoo parlor.

43:29.480 --> 43:31.660
There is a sign on the door that reads,

43:31.660 --> 43:34.560
permanently closed, filed for bankruptcy.

43:34.560 --> 43:36.960
We later learned that Ed had a criminal warrant

43:36.960 --> 43:38.440
and fled to Mexico.

43:38.440 --> 43:39.760
Update six, so my question,

43:39.760 --> 43:42.000
will the Marines let me in with such a tattoo?

43:44.600 --> 43:46.800
So I figured this could be like a new fun like fiction

43:46.800 --> 43:50.280
corner just to see like the sort of fun slice of life

43:50.280 --> 43:54.100
Gene ass shepherd stories that the Yahoo answer service

43:54.100 --> 43:55.300
can produce for us.

43:55.300 --> 43:58.040
Because this one is so rich,

43:58.040 --> 43:59.640
put it right in the reader's digest.

43:59.640 --> 44:01.160
I don't know if you can say masturbate

44:01.160 --> 44:03.280
in the reader's digest.

44:03.280 --> 44:05.160
So maybe we'll have to like switch that word out

44:05.160 --> 44:07.320
and I think they say fuck in here somewhere.

44:07.320 --> 44:10.080
But I read this and obviously it's not true,

44:10.080 --> 44:12.520
but gosh, it was such a gut buster.

44:12.520 --> 44:14.840
Yeah, and what a journey.

44:14.840 --> 44:17.140
And it takes you on a journey.

44:17.140 --> 44:20.240
I did not see it coming that Ed would be a criminal

44:20.240 --> 44:21.520
who fled to Mexico,

44:21.520 --> 44:24.040
but I really feel like that was a necessary component

44:24.040 --> 44:26.080
that really tied everything together.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.720
I think it's amazing that both fled to Mexico

44:28.720 --> 44:30.840
and filed for bankruptcy.

44:30.840 --> 44:32.700
Yeah, I didn't even need both.

44:32.700 --> 44:33.660
If you think about it,

44:33.660 --> 44:35.360
that could have been the end of the story either way,

44:35.360 --> 44:37.760
but I think that that's a detail that really...

44:40.760 --> 44:43.240
I don't think that's how updates work.

44:43.240 --> 44:44.080
No. That's one thing

44:44.080 --> 44:47.660
I will definitely say that that's not how,

44:47.660 --> 44:50.260
it's not chapter headings.

44:50.260 --> 44:51.100
Right.

44:52.600 --> 44:55.320
No, this is an outline for a book

44:55.320 --> 44:56.760
that this person's writing.

44:56.760 --> 44:57.600
Okay.

44:57.600 --> 44:58.420
Yeah.

44:58.420 --> 44:59.600
Are there people responding to it

44:59.600 --> 45:02.440
who are kind of saying like that's lying?

45:02.440 --> 45:03.480
Yeah, Mercury says,

45:03.480 --> 45:05.360
it sounds like a made up story.

45:05.360 --> 45:06.440
Does it?

45:06.440 --> 45:10.000
Gunji says, nice story, now prove it.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.260
You don't want them to prove it

45:11.260 --> 45:12.720
because that means they have to go get a tattoo

45:12.720 --> 45:15.400
that says I love to masturbate.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.040
Oh no, they challenge me.

45:17.040 --> 45:19.920
Well, I guess I made my bed.

45:19.920 --> 45:21.000
And then Edwina says,

45:21.000 --> 45:22.600
and you believe your basketball buddies?

45:22.600 --> 45:24.880
Find somebody to look at your back and tell you what it says.

45:24.880 --> 45:27.040
Eventually you'll hear repeating answers.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.200
That's where update two came in.

45:30.200 --> 45:32.360
Yeah, common sense says current guidelines

45:32.360 --> 45:33.200
are more liberal.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.640
You should be fine if it's not in your hands,

45:34.640 --> 45:35.480
face or forearms.

45:35.480 --> 45:39.000
I think they'll be fine, nothing to worry about.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.320
Marines are like, yeah, we actually like that too a lot.

45:42.320 --> 45:45.080
It's a good tattoo because it's not your face or forearms.

45:45.080 --> 45:46.020
No one got to see that.

45:46.020 --> 45:47.700
You got a backpack on.

45:47.700 --> 45:49.260
I'm getting married in a little over a month

45:49.260 --> 45:51.420
and I recently made the grave mistake

45:51.420 --> 45:53.760
of mentioning to my soon to be father-in-law

45:53.760 --> 45:56.480
that I was kind of a magic nerd when I was a kid

45:56.480 --> 45:58.400
and that I often said I wanted to be a magician

45:58.400 --> 45:59.240
when I grew up.

45:59.240 --> 46:00.800
He said that I should put on a magic show

46:00.800 --> 46:02.500
for his birthday in a couple of months.

46:02.500 --> 46:05.120
Oh no. Oh yes, yes.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.920
Thinking that he was obviously joking,

46:06.920 --> 46:08.320
I said, yeah, sure.

46:08.320 --> 46:10.080
Brothers, he was not joking.

46:10.080 --> 46:12.880
He kept bringing up how excited he is for this magic show.

46:12.880 --> 46:16.320
Out of pure social awkwardness, I kept going along with it.

46:16.320 --> 46:19.760
It's important to note, I have no idea how to do magic.

46:19.760 --> 46:21.640
What do I do?

46:21.640 --> 46:23.840
That's from whatever the opposite of a prestige is

46:23.840 --> 46:24.660
in Pittsburgh.

46:24.660 --> 46:25.680
I want to get a mason jar

46:25.680 --> 46:28.000
and collect the air I'm breathing right now

46:28.000 --> 46:29.840
so I can, I just want to remember everything

46:29.840 --> 46:32.560
about this moment because it's so good to me.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.800
Oh, you fucked up so bad.

46:34.800 --> 46:35.640
Oh my goodness.

46:35.640 --> 46:36.520
Unbelievably bad.

46:36.520 --> 46:37.520
Unbelievably bad.

46:37.520 --> 46:41.740
You can't let in-laws know about any interest you have

46:41.740 --> 46:44.080
because that will become, in their mind,

46:44.080 --> 46:46.880
the only interest you have.

46:46.880 --> 46:48.680
You know what I mean? You at the very least,

46:48.680 --> 46:52.120
like the best case scenario is you are setting yourself up

46:52.120 --> 46:55.400
to receive magic kits every Christmas

46:55.400 --> 46:57.320
for the rest of your natural life.

46:57.320 --> 47:02.000
Now that I say that out loud, that sounds pretty good.

47:02.000 --> 47:02.840
Extremely good.

47:02.840 --> 47:04.240
It actually doesn't sound that bad.

47:04.240 --> 47:07.240
I would lock myself in a box as part of the trick

47:07.240 --> 47:09.800
and then inside there, I've got an itty bitty book light

47:09.800 --> 47:12.040
and a novel and I just stay in there

47:12.040 --> 47:13.720
until everyone goes away.

47:13.720 --> 47:15.080
I catch up on your Bible.

47:16.620 --> 47:18.500
Where it says you're not allowed to do magic.

47:18.500 --> 47:19.500
What if that was your thing?

47:19.500 --> 47:21.160
It's like, I used to be way into magic,

47:21.160 --> 47:25.000
but now I'm just super fundamentalist only.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.400
Sorry, dad.

47:26.400 --> 47:28.120
Yes. Suffer not a witch.

47:28.120 --> 47:29.320
Sorry, my dude.

47:30.520 --> 47:31.360
It's in the book.

47:31.360 --> 47:32.660
The good one, I say.

47:38.480 --> 47:41.080
You have fucked up so incredibly badly

47:41.080 --> 47:43.140
that I don't think that we can help.

47:43.140 --> 47:44.720
What if you just did it?

47:44.720 --> 47:47.860
Yeah, just do it and rock their fucking socks off.

47:47.860 --> 47:50.840
What if you cut the dad in half, really?

47:50.840 --> 47:53.280
That's so bad.

47:53.280 --> 47:55.880
Can you even imagine how bad that would be?

47:55.880 --> 47:57.280
No, don't murder.

47:57.280 --> 47:59.040
It would be for magic.

47:59.040 --> 48:00.720
It would be for magic.

48:00.720 --> 48:02.200
How many times do you think people have tried

48:02.200 --> 48:04.160
that defense in court of like,

48:04.160 --> 48:05.840
you cut this person in half, like, yeah,

48:05.840 --> 48:08.140
but I was trying to do a trick and it went really badly.

48:08.140 --> 48:10.320
Like, it's not my fault.

48:10.320 --> 48:12.400
It's not my fault that I'm bad at magic.

48:12.400 --> 48:13.320
They moved.

48:17.120 --> 48:19.440
I wanna let you guys know that I just found the website

48:19.440 --> 48:22.480
for F-C-M.org.

48:22.480 --> 48:26.760
That's F-C-M.org, the Fellowship of Christian Magicians.

48:26.760 --> 48:28.320
So they're gonna call you on it.

48:28.320 --> 48:30.260
If they go poking around at all,

48:30.260 --> 48:32.800
they are almost certainly going to, as I found,

48:32.800 --> 48:35.640
the very first result being

48:35.640 --> 48:37.720
the Fellowship of Christian Magicians.

48:37.720 --> 48:41.260
Their 2019 convention is coming up pretty soon,

48:41.260 --> 48:42.640
so make sure you do check that out.

48:42.640 --> 48:43.660
Well, next year, right?

48:43.660 --> 48:44.920
They're not doing it this year, are they?

48:44.920 --> 48:47.120
Because that would be a pretty cool trick.

48:47.120 --> 48:48.880
Guys, I just wanna tell you all,

48:48.880 --> 48:49.960
I'm not gonna read it all,

48:49.960 --> 48:51.880
because I'm sure it's actually pretty fascinating.

48:51.880 --> 48:55.080
There is at least 1500 words creed

48:55.080 --> 48:57.300
about whether or not it's okay to do magic.

48:57.300 --> 49:00.080
So make sure you do check that out.

49:00.080 --> 49:02.160
Oh, God, I just got itchy, Justin.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.440
I got itchy with the urge.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.240
I need to read this, please.

49:05.240 --> 49:06.080
I know, I know.

49:06.080 --> 49:07.880
Can we take a break from the show, or what's up?

49:07.880 --> 49:09.280
While you read it, Griffin,

49:09.280 --> 49:11.040
I've got a solution to this problem,

49:11.040 --> 49:11.960
how you get out of it.

49:11.960 --> 49:14.640
You're also going to drop on your future father-in-law

49:14.640 --> 49:15.840
that when you were a kid,

49:15.840 --> 49:19.280
you also were really into prosthetic makeup.

49:19.280 --> 49:21.200
Like, you guys love stage makeup.

49:21.200 --> 49:23.960
And then you're gonna hire a member

49:23.960 --> 49:25.600
of the Fellowship of Christian Magicians

49:25.600 --> 49:29.400
that you kind of look like, and show up,

49:29.400 --> 49:30.800
and they're gonna do the show,

49:30.800 --> 49:33.040
and then you're gonna pull off your prosthetic makeup.

49:33.040 --> 49:34.280
Once the show's done, you do the bit,

49:34.280 --> 49:35.480
you know, oh, it's you.

49:35.480 --> 49:36.520
And then you're like, that was me.

49:36.520 --> 49:38.200
I did the show, and I did it so good,

49:38.200 --> 49:39.280
I could never do it again.

49:39.280 --> 49:40.500
Please don't ever ask.

49:41.580 --> 49:42.520
The end. Sorry, Trevor.

49:42.520 --> 49:44.880
I was not listening, and you had to know that.

49:44.880 --> 49:47.560
I was reading this Constitution, my friend.

49:47.560 --> 49:50.540
Because it's genuinely interesting.

49:50.540 --> 49:53.340
What Travis said, I'm sure, was the right answer.

49:54.760 --> 49:56.800
That is almost certainly helpful.

49:56.800 --> 49:57.720
Probably.

49:59.080 --> 50:02.120
How many tricks does a magic show make?

50:02.120 --> 50:05.040
I mean, if you have one really good one,

50:05.040 --> 50:06.560
I think you're safe.

50:06.560 --> 50:09.120
No, sorry, no.

50:09.120 --> 50:11.520
If you do one magic trick,

50:11.520 --> 50:14.400
that is a trick that could happen impromptu.

50:14.400 --> 50:17.960
If someone asks you to prepare a show,

50:17.960 --> 50:20.200
I think you need a tight five.

50:20.200 --> 50:21.480
I think you need a tight five

50:21.480 --> 50:23.960
to be able to call it a show with a straight face.

50:23.960 --> 50:25.360
It's gotta be a good five.

50:26.580 --> 50:28.440
What is a magic show, though?

50:32.440 --> 50:34.000
Because everybody has different ideas of it.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.760
Some people do cards, some people do the rings thing,

50:36.760 --> 50:38.200
and some people just hold their breath

50:38.200 --> 50:40.600
on Oprah for 20 minutes.

50:40.600 --> 50:45.160
And so you could do maybe that.

50:45.160 --> 50:47.120
You could say, okay, here's the trick,

50:47.120 --> 50:48.400
and you turn on the TV,

50:48.400 --> 50:51.080
and then Oprah is back,

50:51.080 --> 50:53.040
which is a trick in and of itself.

50:53.040 --> 50:55.080
And then you walk onto, and she's like,

50:56.120 --> 50:58.340
this show's all about people holding their breath

50:58.340 --> 50:59.860
a very long time now.

51:01.480 --> 51:03.640
So you go in the big tank, and you try to do it,

51:03.640 --> 51:05.000
but you're not, here's the thing,

51:05.000 --> 51:05.920
you don't have to do it,

51:05.920 --> 51:07.060
because you can be like, oh no,

51:07.060 --> 51:10.720
I ate a big hoagie right before I came here, Oprah,

51:10.720 --> 51:12.400
so I got the cramps, can't do it.

51:12.400 --> 51:14.400
But I tried, Dad, I love you.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.200
Maybe you let someone punch you in the stomach,

51:16.200 --> 51:18.640
like Houdini, it's pretty good.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.600
I can withstand it, not die like him,

51:20.600 --> 51:22.580
so now I'm the better magician.

51:22.580 --> 51:23.960
Yeah, right?

51:23.960 --> 51:26.580
Or maybe, oh, just eat that big Subway sandwich

51:26.580 --> 51:27.680
right in front of him.

51:27.680 --> 51:28.520
Mm-hmm.

51:28.520 --> 51:30.120
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

51:30.120 --> 51:32.000
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.140
What do you think, Dad?

51:33.140 --> 51:34.760
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

51:34.760 --> 51:36.240
I'm gonna do the whole thing, Daddy, I love you.

51:36.240 --> 51:37.760
Can I call you Daddy, by the way?

51:37.760 --> 51:41.640
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

51:41.640 --> 51:46.640
Maybe you do a special show with the lights off.

51:47.680 --> 51:51.040
Oh, erotic magic, ero magic.

51:51.040 --> 51:54.680
I do erotic magic, and it's sensory magic, okay?

51:54.680 --> 51:59.320
So it's not gonna be able to be seen with the naked eye,

51:59.320 --> 52:00.760
so all the lights will be off,

52:00.760 --> 52:04.520
and the magic will happen all around you.

52:04.520 --> 52:07.800
You don't need to see magic, you can smell magic,

52:07.800 --> 52:09.040
you can taste magic.

52:09.040 --> 52:10.040
Oh my God.

52:10.040 --> 52:11.160
And as you're saying all this stuff,

52:11.160 --> 52:13.560
you're slowly making your way towards the door,

52:13.560 --> 52:17.560
and by the time, and then you put a chair

52:17.560 --> 52:19.680
underneath the door on the outside.

52:19.680 --> 52:23.440
Yeah, you cask of a Montalato to your dad, your new dad.

52:23.440 --> 52:27.560
And, and, let me say this, all of his friends.

52:27.560 --> 52:31.400
You just, and they'll, your dad is probably gonna eat

52:31.400 --> 52:34.760
his friends at some point, unless they eat him first.

52:34.760 --> 52:39.600
And that's, and then, and then, and then, after two weeks,

52:39.600 --> 52:43.040
you go and you remove the door, and you open it,

52:43.040 --> 52:47.800
and their skeletons fall out, and you say, ta-da.

52:47.800 --> 52:51.720
So you think after two weeks, your future father-in-law

52:51.720 --> 52:54.000
will not only have resorted to cannibalism,

52:54.000 --> 52:59.000
but he has everyone else in the room clean to the bone.

53:00.800 --> 53:05.800
And your future partner's gonna be like, what the heck?

53:06.280 --> 53:08.040
And you'll be like, no, it's like that fucking,

53:08.040 --> 53:10.360
it's like the social magic.

53:10.360 --> 53:11.720
You know what I mean?

53:11.720 --> 53:15.480
Because your dad was clearly only a hair's breadth away

53:15.480 --> 53:17.240
from cannibalism.

53:17.240 --> 53:18.320
You don't understand.

53:18.320 --> 53:20.640
I'm on that Darren Brown shit, it's social magic.

53:20.640 --> 53:22.520
I made your dad eat all his friends.

53:22.520 --> 53:25.800
With the power of suggestion, with the power of suggestion

53:25.800 --> 53:27.560
and hunger, I made your dad turn all his friend

53:27.560 --> 53:29.660
into skeletons, I'm like Darren Brown.

53:29.660 --> 53:32.720
There was another door he could've walked out at any time,

53:32.720 --> 53:34.480
and yet he didn't, why?

53:34.480 --> 53:35.840
The window's open.

53:35.840 --> 53:37.980
He wanted to eat his friends, the window's open,

53:37.980 --> 53:39.640
they could see everything.

53:39.640 --> 53:41.200
Hello, I'm Darren Brown.

53:41.200 --> 53:43.120
Today, on my new Netflix special,

53:43.120 --> 53:45.160
I have a theory about people I'd like to prove.

53:45.160 --> 53:47.960
We all wanna eat all our friends and turn them into bones.

53:49.240 --> 53:51.520
To accomplish this, I'm going to lock my father-in-law

53:51.520 --> 53:54.000
in a closet for three minutes.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.360
Oh my God, like a pack of piranhas, he has boned his friend.

53:58.360 --> 54:00.520
Oops, little magician joke.

54:00.520 --> 54:01.440
I'm Darren Brown.

54:01.440 --> 54:03.760
Hey, push that guy off that cliff.

54:03.760 --> 54:04.740
I can do anything.

54:04.740 --> 54:08.380
No jury in the world.

54:08.380 --> 54:11.140
This is my wife, Plumaria, I love her very much,

54:11.140 --> 54:14.180
and she loves her dad, and you're gonna love her dad

54:15.140 --> 54:18.220
as you watch him eat all his good friends.

54:18.220 --> 54:19.420
Why am I doing this?

54:19.420 --> 54:20.380
I don't know.

54:20.380 --> 54:21.940
Someone please help me.

54:21.940 --> 54:24.460
I'm just topping myself over and over again.

54:24.460 --> 54:26.220
I don't know why I pretended to be a magician

54:26.220 --> 54:28.140
to my dad in turn.

54:28.140 --> 54:30.380
That's right, this is all for his benefit.

54:30.380 --> 54:31.900
Let's wrap it right up.

54:31.900 --> 54:34.740
Folks, thank you so much for joining us.

54:35.940 --> 54:37.400
Kind of a weird one.

54:37.400 --> 54:41.020
Poor Travis has been home for about 24 hours,

54:41.020 --> 54:43.280
and then he's gonna get back on a plane

54:43.280 --> 54:46.140
and go over to London.

54:46.140 --> 54:49.460
So expect a lot of really good accents coming up.

54:49.460 --> 54:50.780
Oh, yeah.

54:50.780 --> 54:51.980
Before too long.

54:51.980 --> 54:55.180
All right, so everybody, real quick, some plugs.

54:55.180 --> 54:57.880
We just launched a bunch of new stuff on macroemerch.com,

54:57.880 --> 55:02.380
including a Schmaners t-shirt and a Schmaners pin set,

55:02.380 --> 55:05.740
but, and I say this as one half of Schmaners,

55:05.740 --> 55:08.220
even more importantly, we launched

55:08.220 --> 55:11.140
our generic podcast merch line,

55:11.140 --> 55:14.700
which is like the silliest and my new favorite thing.

55:14.700 --> 55:17.620
We've had the idea for a long time,

55:17.620 --> 55:19.140
and it's finally happening.

55:20.420 --> 55:23.800
And you can get a mug that says don't talk to me

55:23.800 --> 55:26.040
before I've had my podcast.

55:26.040 --> 55:29.560
You can get a poster that says a journey of a thousand miles

55:29.560 --> 55:31.340
begins with a single podcast,

55:31.340 --> 55:35.020
and you probably should get all these things.

55:35.020 --> 55:39.060
There's a beer koozie that says podcaster on it.

55:39.060 --> 55:41.140
With like three frogs saying it.

55:41.140 --> 55:41.980
It's pretty great.

55:43.660 --> 55:47.820
And our proceeds for that are going to an organization

55:47.820 --> 55:49.180
in our hometown of Huntington, West Virginia,

55:49.180 --> 55:52.740
who is working to help combat opiate addiction.

55:52.740 --> 55:56.780
So it's for a good cause and it's fun and dumb.

55:56.780 --> 55:58.900
So you can go to macroemerch.com.

55:58.900 --> 56:01.260
I'm doing another CUS show here in Cincinnati,

56:01.260 --> 56:05.420
bit.ly, CUS September 2018.

56:05.420 --> 56:08.380
That's September 23rd, get your tickets now.

56:08.380 --> 56:10.740
I'm also doing a show at New York Comic Con

56:10.740 --> 56:14.260
with Janet Varney and Jean Grey and Miles Luna

56:14.260 --> 56:17.980
and Samus the Rapper and Patrick Rothfuss

56:17.980 --> 56:21.660
and the Double Clicks, Pauline Storm, Jonathan Colton.

56:21.660 --> 56:23.800
It's an amazing lineup.

56:23.800 --> 56:25.540
And Schmaners is going to be there as well.

56:25.540 --> 56:29.700
You can get tickets for that at bit.ly slash McElroy NYC.

56:29.700 --> 56:32.100
There's also a- NYCC.

56:32.100 --> 56:34.700
Thank you, McElroy NYCC.

56:34.700 --> 56:36.900
There's also a Taz panel at New York Comic Con,

56:36.900 --> 56:39.900
in which we will be previewing book two

56:39.900 --> 56:41.620
of the Taz graphic novel.

56:41.620 --> 56:46.140
You can get tickets for that at bit.ly slash Taz NYCC.

56:46.140 --> 56:48.380
Also go get the Sawbones book.

56:48.380 --> 56:49.200
It's a great book.

56:49.200 --> 56:51.220
We got hooked up with some early copies of it

56:51.220 --> 56:54.500
and I was enjoying it very much on the flight home.

56:54.500 --> 56:56.060
And there's some juice,

56:56.060 --> 56:57.980
there's some gnar shit in there, bud.

56:57.980 --> 56:59.160
Oh, thanks, bud.

56:59.160 --> 57:00.220
I'm glad you like it.

57:00.220 --> 57:01.060
It's pretty gnarly.

57:01.060 --> 57:01.900
We had to write all of it.

57:01.900 --> 57:02.720
It's pretty gnar.

57:02.720 --> 57:05.020
There's a huge picture of a dick on page two.

57:05.020 --> 57:06.140
It's so awesome.

57:06.140 --> 57:08.140
Yeah, cool to flip that open on an airplane,

57:08.140 --> 57:10.340
but where can people pre-order the Sawbones book?

57:10.340 --> 57:12.980
Bit.ly slash the Sawbones book.

57:12.980 --> 57:15.460
And Travis has a new show out called Positivitini

57:15.460 --> 57:17.220
that comes out several times a week.

57:17.220 --> 57:18.900
Yes, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

57:18.900 --> 57:21.540
It's messages of hope, joy, and inspiration

57:21.540 --> 57:24.300
in 10 minutes or less with me and my friends,

57:24.300 --> 57:26.660
Amy Dallin and Erica Ishii.

57:26.660 --> 57:28.540
It's just a little positive thing

57:28.540 --> 57:31.200
and you can find it on all your different podcatchers.

57:31.200 --> 57:32.600
Positivitini.

57:33.600 --> 57:35.220
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

57:35.220 --> 57:36.060
for these four theme song.

57:36.060 --> 57:38.140
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

57:38.140 --> 57:40.100
It's a very good album that you should just have.

57:40.100 --> 57:41.960

58:07.340 --> 58:09.740
my dog doesn't wanna go on walks with me anymore

58:09.740 --> 58:10.980
because of the owls.

58:10.980 --> 58:12.420
Does the dog know?

58:14.140 --> 58:15.600
Hi.

58:15.600 --> 58:17.120

58:20.500 --> 58:21.340
Kiss your dad.

58:21.340 --> 58:22.500
Square on the lips.

58:25.540 --> 58:30.540
Hey, good girls, do you wanna just say hey, I wanna?

Hello, listeners of MaximumFun.

58:46.860 --> 58:48.860
I wanna tell you about our newest podcast

58:48.860 --> 58:51.540
that tells you all about the truth of the flat earth.

58:51.540 --> 58:53.300
Have you been looking out over the horizon

58:53.300 --> 58:54.740
and you've been thinking, wait a minute,

58:54.740 --> 58:56.340
this doesn't look round.

58:56.340 --> 58:58.380
I've been lied to my whole life.

58:58.380 --> 59:02.740
What is NASA doing with $52 million a day?

59:02.740 --> 59:04.420
Uh, uh, come on.

59:04.420 --> 59:06.420
We explode the myths.

59:06.420 --> 59:07.860
Just kidding.

59:07.860 --> 59:09.320
We're Oh No Ross and Kerry

59:09.320 --> 59:11.740
and we investigate extraordinary claims.

59:11.740 --> 59:12.720
That's right.

59:12.720 --> 59:15.420
We investigate extraordinary claims firsthand.

59:15.420 --> 59:17.300
We go undercover in fringe groups.

59:17.300 --> 59:19.460
We get alternative medicine treatments

59:19.460 --> 59:22.480
and we hang out with people who have unusual beliefs

59:22.480 --> 59:24.660
like flat earthers, 9-11 truthers.

59:24.660 --> 59:26.100
We do ghost investigations.

59:26.100 --> 59:27.620
We've joined Scientology

59:27.620 --> 59:29.460
and we got baptized in the Mormon church.

59:29.460 --> 59:32.700
If it goes bump in the night, then so do we.

59:32.700 --> 59:34.500
Hmm.
