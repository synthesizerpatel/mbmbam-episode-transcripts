00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.120
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

00:47.120 --> 00:51.840
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:51.840 --> 00:55.440
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:55.440 --> 01:02.240
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 boy, Griffin McElroy.

01:02.240 --> 01:06.720
I came up with a theme for this opening bit.

01:06.720 --> 01:07.760
Okay, go for it.

01:07.760 --> 01:08.560
Do it again, sorry.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.320
I just, I won't do it if you guys-

01:12.320 --> 01:14.640
No, rip it, rip that shit.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.160
Do it. Grip it and rip it.

01:16.960 --> 01:17.760
Okay.

01:17.760 --> 01:22.960
You got your problems. Whoa, I got my eyes wide.

01:22.960 --> 01:28.720
Oh, you got your big Gs. I got my smash pipe.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.040
This is smash pipe.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.000
Wait, hold on.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.520
It's where we take, it's a Smash Brothers dispatch direct from us to you.

01:38.720 --> 01:44.000
I don't think it counts as fair use, Justin, if you just change cash to smash.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.600
I don't think that counts as a parody.

01:45.600 --> 01:51.440
Travis, listen, there's no amount of licensing fees I would not pay to keep that great joke

01:51.440 --> 01:54.480
in the beginning of our episode of our podcast.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.120
Okay.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.960
Welcome to Smash Pipe, everyone.

01:56.960 --> 02:03.920
Light it up and huff this great news and strategies and cheat codes for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.880
Can I start it off with a little cheat?

02:07.440 --> 02:10.800
That also is going to include my favorite character to play as.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.480
Go for it, please.

02:12.480 --> 02:17.200
If you scroll all the way up in the character creation screen, I mean, just keep holding up

02:17.200 --> 02:19.840
way past when it seems like there's no further to go up.

02:19.840 --> 02:25.520
You can eventually select the pencil from the NES game anticipation.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.480
Fucking great.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.240
And you can play as the pencil.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.200
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.320
Fuck, it's so good.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.280
Such a good game.

02:33.280 --> 02:39.520
What he does is he draws a cube around the other players and then they can't escape from that cube.

02:39.520 --> 02:40.320
That's pretty good.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.920
It takes forever, though.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.040
You have to wait.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.360
That hints the anticipation.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.480
Justin, you got me.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.360
Who's your favorite characters and strategies in cheat codes?

02:49.360 --> 02:51.360
And cheat codes from Super Smash Brothers.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.720
I have a cheat code that I'd like to lay out.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.480
My favorite character is Seaman.

02:56.480 --> 03:01.280
He can't do anything because they won't have pure water stages.

03:02.320 --> 03:05.680
So Seaman just lays on the ground and complains at you until you throw him back.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.840
But then it's like, ring out.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.320
So that's a loss every time.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.360
It's a guaranteed loss.

03:11.360 --> 03:14.240
But it's a challenging character with a lot of different dimensions.

03:14.240 --> 03:23.360
And my cheat code is that if you press A three times in a row at any point while you're playing the game,

03:24.800 --> 03:28.880
you will get a refund check from Reggie Fils-Aime from his personal checking account.

03:28.880 --> 03:29.200
Wow.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.040
And that is true.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.040
Does the game self-delete at that point?

03:33.040 --> 03:42.240
The game self-deletes and it wipes your hard drive of any, in your memory, of Smash Brothers.

03:42.240 --> 03:45.840
And it doesn't even give you like an, are you sure you want to do this kind of command?

03:45.840 --> 03:46.560
No, no.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.440
If you press the A button three times,

03:49.440 --> 03:53.200
you get a refund check from Reggie Fils-Aime's personal checking account.

03:53.200 --> 03:53.600
That's good.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.600
Your mind is erased of all Smash Brothers secrets and content

03:57.600 --> 04:00.320
and also the middle names of everyone you know and love.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.520
That's good.

04:01.520 --> 04:06.000
Well, my favorite character is Tony Shalhoub in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.480
And my cheat code, he's the best, first of all.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.040
He's a great edge defender and he's easier to wave dash.

04:11.040 --> 04:16.720
But my cheat code is, obviously, the character has lots of costumes.

04:16.720 --> 04:17.200
Mm-hmm.

04:17.200 --> 04:21.920
Red Monk, Blue Monk, they're all sort of variations on Monk, Electric Monk.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.040
But you know how the Switch has Amiibos?

04:25.040 --> 04:25.760
Uh-huh.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.640
It's delightful new creation from Nintendo that blends both toy and game alike.

04:28.640 --> 04:33.040
If you scan Amiibos on it, you can earn unlocks, as we call them in the business.

04:33.040 --> 04:41.600
If you can find Tony Shalhoub in real life and swipe his face across your Switch,

04:41.600 --> 04:44.400
it'll unlock the Antonio Scarpacci skin.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.040
Whoa.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.000
That's huge.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.760
My favorite character is the big scary moon from Majora's Mask.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.440
Yeah, well, yeah, big one.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.600
And you crash into the whole screen.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.600
I'll tell you my favorite character.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.600
I'll tell you my favorite character.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.600
My favorite character.

05:01.600 --> 05:08.960
My favorite character is Bowser the Third.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.720
He's Bowser Jr.'s son.

05:10.720 --> 05:14.560
Bowser Jr. first appeared in 2002, Super Mario Sunshine.

05:14.560 --> 05:15.920
He's a team dad.

05:15.920 --> 05:22.720
Bowser Jr. is now a team dad, a 16-year-old team dad of his son, a baby named Bowser the Third.

05:22.720 --> 05:27.920
He's Bowser Jr.'s son, and he's a great new character in the game Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.800
I like Donkey Dong.

05:34.480 --> 05:36.880
I'm just bananas for Donkey Dong.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.640
I like Donkey Duck.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.360
He's in there, too, from the good place.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.480
That character from the good place.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.320
All the good place characters are in it.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.040
They're in there.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.200
Back for another round.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.240
They're all in there.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.080
Can you play as Mario?

05:50.080 --> 05:54.160
No, so we've done pretty much all of the video game jokes for 2019.

05:54.160 --> 05:54.800
Sorry, gang.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.000
We looked at the ledger.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.720
We realized that we had a large budget of video game jokes that we hadn't told,

06:00.720 --> 06:06.400
and now that we've ostracized the sort of non-ludological members of our audience,

06:06.960 --> 06:08.080
maybe we get into our core compasses.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.880
2019, we're going to get back to video games.

06:10.880 --> 06:16.560
That's who raised us, who supped us at their proverbial breast, and we are here.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.000
Not proverbial, no.

06:18.000 --> 06:18.480
Not proverbial.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.400
Mario's literal breast.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.400
I supped on Mario.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.440
I drank the game milk.

06:23.440 --> 06:28.720
The game milk for the special game cow that we've supped on grew us to where we are today,

06:28.720 --> 06:29.840
so we're really excited.

06:29.840 --> 06:35.440
I'd love to get back to my Wii U so I could play more Smash Brothers Ultimate right now,

06:35.440 --> 06:37.600
but I can't because I got to do this podcast.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.600
We could do both at the same time.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.640
Oh, man, that might be a good streaming thing that people could watch.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.040
You know if we were going to do that, Travis, you know where people could find it?

06:46.000 --> 06:51.040
Our YouTube channel or on our website, themacaroy.family?

06:51.040 --> 06:52.400
Yes, that's the one, Travis.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.400
Our YouTube channel is just called Macaroy Family.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.680
We finally have a website, folks.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.360
That's just too exciting to wait for the end of the show.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.000
We have a website, believe it or not.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.720
We did it.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.200
We set up our GeoCities account, finally.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.600
That's in partnership with Vox.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.600
They're helping us with the website.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.360
If you ever watched Monster Factory from me and Griff, that's here.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.040
A new episode there on our channel, the Macaroy Family.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.760
For some bizarre reason, there's also the episodes I did of Carry On,

07:19.760 --> 07:23.440
a journey through the cinematic career of Jim Carrey starting at the beginning.

07:23.440 --> 07:24.160
I beg you not to put that on there.

07:24.160 --> 07:24.960
This is a bug.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.080
This is a bug.

07:26.080 --> 07:28.800
This is a bug, and we will get it worked out by the time this episode comes out.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.000
If I get enough positive feedback, maybe I'll record the next one.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.600
I still haven't done Once Bitten.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.360
That's the next one in the chronological order.

07:35.360 --> 07:40.640
I only got like four movies into what I assume is like 50-some movies that man has done.

07:40.640 --> 07:45.680
So if you want me to keep going reviewing Jim Carrey movies, go to themacaroy.family,

07:45.680 --> 07:48.720
click on videos, watch some Carry On, let me know what you think.

07:48.720 --> 07:53.040
That's the new home of Carry On, macaroy.family.

07:53.040 --> 07:53.600
Go check it out.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.640
There's lots of other stuff there.

07:54.640 --> 08:01.120
But if you like it, we hope you'll bookmark it and make it your homepage and the only page.

08:01.120 --> 08:05.760
It's also a search engine, as long as the only thing you need is our content.

08:06.640 --> 08:10.480
Let's get into some advice because I have missed helping people

08:10.480 --> 08:18.720
while I've been busy joining this hot, extremely stable world of digital media websites.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.240
So excited to get into it finally.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.920
But let's help some people, all right?

08:23.920 --> 08:24.800
Is that okay?

08:24.800 --> 08:26.480
Just yes, go, just do it, go.

08:26.480 --> 08:27.840
Yeah, you don't need our permission.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.720
Today I learned that next week, the office team I'm part of

08:33.280 --> 08:37.040
is going to be going paintballing as a form of team bonding.

08:37.040 --> 08:40.800
I'm very excited by this since I've always wanted to go paintballing

08:41.360 --> 08:44.480
and I'm also very competitive in nature.

08:44.480 --> 08:50.240
However, everyone that will be there is either my boss or someone who has worked at my office

08:50.240 --> 08:54.320
much longer than I have since I was only just hired at the beginning of the year.

08:54.320 --> 08:57.760
I'm worried about getting into the game and maybe shooting some people I really shouldn't.

08:57.760 --> 08:58.800
What should I do?

08:58.800 --> 09:02.320
Any advice on the best level of competitiveness I should try to achieve?

09:02.320 --> 09:07.120
And that's from Concerned and Competitive in Kalamasa.

09:07.120 --> 09:10.400
Well, I mean, you got your squeegee?

09:10.400 --> 09:12.080
You got your squeegee ready?

09:12.080 --> 09:15.040
Oh, no, Griffin.

09:15.040 --> 09:15.760
What's wrong?

09:15.760 --> 09:16.240
Is that your...

09:18.160 --> 09:23.280
My watch just heard the entirety of that question and would love to weigh in on it.

09:23.280 --> 09:23.840
Sorry, watch.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.080
It said, I'm not sure I understand.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.040
Yeah, no shit, watch.

09:27.040 --> 09:27.840
Yeah, dude.

09:27.840 --> 09:28.480
Calm down.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.840
Daddy's trying to record, okay?

09:29.840 --> 09:35.680
I think that you should go full four.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.720
I think that this is...

09:37.600 --> 09:43.920
We, as humans, many of us have been fortunate enough to not have to taste of battle.

09:45.760 --> 09:51.520
And this is a time to find if something will be awoken within you that maybe the person

09:51.520 --> 09:58.640
that gets the sandwiches can then be the lord of murder with so much blood on their hands.

09:58.640 --> 10:03.440
And from then on, when they get their sandwiches from you, they will know it's from death himself

10:04.080 --> 10:06.080
is coming, is getting the sandwiches today.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.440
Do they make blood balls?

10:08.080 --> 10:11.520
Just like full blown just blood balls.

10:12.560 --> 10:19.280
So that the feeling of the war horniness, you can really feel it.

10:19.280 --> 10:22.080
The warniness, so it can really just kick in.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.840
All you have to do, this is easy.

10:23.840 --> 10:32.080
All you have to do is make sure you're on whoever the head boss is on their team, because

10:32.080 --> 10:37.600
then you go hard and they're like, one, I appreciate your commitment.

10:37.600 --> 10:41.680
Two, I appreciate how you just paintball murdered everyone in accounting.

10:41.680 --> 10:45.600
Just spend the entire game leaping in front of your boss and yelling no.

10:47.600 --> 10:51.200
Eventually, someone is going to shoot you while you're doing that.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.320
They can't legally, they can't fire you at that point.

10:56.480 --> 11:03.120
It is wild in this particular climate of 2018 where it's like, I feel like, and rightly

11:03.120 --> 11:09.600
so, people are a lot more plugged in to how to make everyone feel comfortable in a working

11:09.600 --> 11:13.520
environment and sort of where those lines are because they had been so very blurred

11:13.520 --> 11:19.520
for so long, except this Saturday, we're all going to fucking blaze each other with

11:19.520 --> 11:25.760
extremely painful guns and there will be people who feel targeted because they're literally

11:25.760 --> 11:32.480
100% being targeted by our extremely painful yet non-lethal weaponry.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.920
That's crazy.

11:34.560 --> 11:40.000
Do you live in the one state where like, I don't know where Calamity is, probably in

11:40.000 --> 11:41.120
California, it seems.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.840
Do you not have laser tag within a hundred mile radius of you?

11:45.840 --> 11:50.640
Because it's like paintball, but with like nachos and no paint.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.400
You gotta feel it, Trev.

11:53.040 --> 11:57.680
I can't feel a laser and they try to make the vest vibrate and that does not set off

11:57.680 --> 11:59.200
my war horniness.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.080
I need it to be, I need the feeling.

12:02.080 --> 12:06.320
Can I make a suggestion to you that's different from the suggestions we've put forward so

12:06.320 --> 12:06.720
far?

12:06.720 --> 12:07.280
Please do.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.520
You're on your team and there's an enemy team, maybe you're playing capture the flag,

12:11.520 --> 12:13.920
maybe you're just playing a good old team death match.

12:13.920 --> 12:18.720
You leave your team immediately, run away from as fast as you can, head into the woods.

12:18.720 --> 12:22.560
In there, you're gonna find the ghillie suit that you planted the previous night and you're

12:22.560 --> 12:23.520
gonna climb into that.

12:23.520 --> 12:30.160
You're gonna find the $500 sniper paintball rifle that you bought on the dark web and

12:30.160 --> 12:37.600
then you're just gonna start taking people out, sort of agnostic of team, just sort of

12:37.600 --> 12:38.640
away from team.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.240
You are going to be-

12:40.240 --> 12:41.280
You're going rogue.

12:41.280 --> 12:42.640
You're going to be predator.

12:42.640 --> 12:48.480
You're gonna have two long sort of paint rollers that are gonna shoot out of your wrists like,

12:48.480 --> 12:52.720
you know, wrist mounted blades that you're gonna cover in paint and hit people with them

12:52.720 --> 12:55.440
but when they turn to look at what hit them, you're already gone.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.160
And then they're gonna call a ref and be like, is this legal?

12:58.960 --> 13:00.000
Is this legal?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.360
You hit me with a paint roller.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.360
You should tell people you're not gonna come.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.680
Tell them that you'd love to make it but you're gonna be on vacation in Petaluma and send

13:09.680 --> 13:13.840
them pictures, like set up your phone, you can probably get like an automated script

13:13.840 --> 13:18.080
to do this sort of thing, like text everybody at your office mid-match, like having a great

13:18.080 --> 13:22.080
time here in Petaluma, wish you were here, wish I could be there, hope y'all are being

13:22.080 --> 13:22.800
safe out there.

13:22.800 --> 13:27.040
And then like while they're checking your text, dead.

13:27.040 --> 13:27.440
What's that?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.120
You're triangulating the signal.

13:29.760 --> 13:30.640
You used it.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.360
Oh, you heard their message tones go off.

13:33.920 --> 13:37.040
You come up from the ground, you just splatoon them from the inside out.

13:37.040 --> 13:37.680
I love it.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.840
Add everybody in your office.

13:39.840 --> 13:42.640
Say, hey, listen, I'd love to keep track of the fun.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.160
Can I add you on Find My Friends?

13:46.000 --> 13:49.520
Before, I'd love to keep track of all the fun everybody's having and then like, how

13:49.520 --> 13:50.880
does he know where I am?

13:50.880 --> 13:51.520
Oh, that's great.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.880
You send them that picture, right?

13:52.880 --> 13:54.720
And then they text back like, looks great.

13:55.680 --> 13:56.240
What's that?

13:56.240 --> 13:59.520
It sounded like that message alert came from right behind me.

14:00.960 --> 14:01.460
Good.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.680
Hey, can I read y'all a Yahoo?

14:03.680 --> 14:04.240
Yes, please.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.840
No, but do just have fun out there.

14:05.840 --> 14:06.880
Yeah, just have a lot of fun.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.520
You won't because it's the most exhausting activity.

14:09.520 --> 14:14.960
Yeah, maybe just let yourself get shot and go to like the concession stand and have like

14:14.960 --> 14:16.000
ice cream cone or something.

14:16.000 --> 14:16.480
Something.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.040
Addie sent this one and thank you, Addie.

14:19.040 --> 14:23.600
It's a Yahoo answers user who has chosen to remain anonymous and I respect their choice

14:23.600 --> 14:24.640
so they will get no name.

14:25.280 --> 14:33.440
They ask, if I break a wishbone by myself, right hand versus left hand, will I get my wish?

14:34.240 --> 14:36.640
My husband always gets the larger part of the wishbone.

14:36.640 --> 14:37.360
Always.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.440
And consequently gets his wish.

14:39.440 --> 14:43.600
He's wished for and received trips, cars, money, even a dog.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.160
Let me start over.

14:46.160 --> 14:51.280
He's wished for and received trips, cars, money, even a dog, which magically showed up

14:51.280 --> 14:53.600
after he got the bigger part of the wishbone.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.080
I, on the other hand, have gotten nothing.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.480
So I've decided to break the wishbone by myself.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.680
The right hand will have one wish and the left hand will have a different wish.

15:01.680 --> 15:10.640
My, my, my husband says it is the means of distribution of the two wishes to your two

15:10.640 --> 15:13.200
discreet hands is something I'm very curious about.

15:13.200 --> 15:17.040
If you whisper it into your closed fist and try not to let it escape.

15:17.040 --> 15:22.000
Anyway, my husband says it is totally against the wishbone quote rules and I'll end up putting

15:22.000 --> 15:24.480
a hex on all our future wishbone endeavors.

15:24.480 --> 15:27.600
Can anyone offer any insight on the wishbone dilemma?

15:27.600 --> 15:29.520
I sure can offer insight.

15:29.520 --> 15:34.320
Your husband wants to buy himself trips and cars and dogs and stuff and he's already done

15:34.320 --> 15:39.040
it and then he rigs the wishbone so that he wins and then he's like, I didn't buy it,

15:39.040 --> 15:40.960
I need the wishbone, brought the car.

15:40.960 --> 15:44.480
It's a complicated pulley system that he has attached to the back of his belt.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.800
He wins the wishbone, he starts walking backwards.

15:46.800 --> 15:50.480
The pulley releases the dog suspended from the ceiling.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.280
Miracle dog.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.560
Thank you, wishbone.

15:52.560 --> 15:56.800
And your husband knows that if you were to break it yourself, you would blow this whole

15:56.800 --> 15:58.000
thing wide open.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.600
Yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

16:01.600 --> 16:05.760
I am not a vegetarian, obviously, I love meat.

16:05.760 --> 16:09.840
We have time to make this kind of revelation, Justin, but go on.

16:09.840 --> 16:16.080
Yeah, this is one I'm not sure I could explain to turkeys.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.440
It's a secret.

16:17.440 --> 16:22.720
If turkeys did decide to ask me like, are you sure about this, about the whole thing?

16:22.720 --> 16:25.200
I would say like, yeah, I get it.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.600
Like, I need to eat you for sustenance.

16:27.600 --> 16:31.840
And they're like, okay, but what about the part where you wait for my dad's neck bone

16:31.840 --> 16:39.040
to dry and then you and your dad grab it and fight over it and break it in front of me

16:39.040 --> 16:42.080
and then make a wish on my dad's dried bones?

16:42.080 --> 16:42.480
As you said-

16:42.480 --> 16:48.000
What I can only call like a macabre sacrifice to your hope that, I don't know, your favorite

16:48.000 --> 16:49.600
football team wins or something.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.480
Something.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.040
Like it could, it's, it's ghoulish.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.360
I would have a hard time.

16:55.360 --> 16:59.360
Like you didn't even call it by the bone that it is in the turkey.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.280
You're calling it a wishbone.

17:01.280 --> 17:01.920
Wink.

17:01.920 --> 17:02.560
Nope.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.200
It's not.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.040
It's not that.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.560
This, I couldn't stop thinking about this when I was looking at this Yahoo.

17:08.560 --> 17:14.400
This thought of like, you know how in like cartoons and like some fantasy shit, there's

17:14.400 --> 17:21.360
like ogres or like the Uruk-hai in the Lord of the Rings movies where you look at them

17:21.360 --> 17:26.240
and they like just fucking tear a little goblin apart and start gnawing on its bones and you

17:26.240 --> 17:29.120
see that and you're like, barbaric.

17:29.920 --> 17:34.800
That's kind of what we do with the turkey's neck every year it seems like a little bit.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.800
It's kind of, maybe now we're the, we're the barbarians.

17:38.800 --> 17:43.200
I mean there was a moment, this was my first year making a turkey, roasting a turkey for

17:43.200 --> 17:49.520
Thanksgiving and I did at one point put it on my hand like a Muppet and I thought that

17:49.520 --> 17:54.480
was very funny, not thinking about the fact that at one point it was a living being who

17:54.480 --> 17:55.360
probably had friends.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.680
So does the wish come true if you do it by yourself?

17:59.680 --> 18:04.560
Let's, I want to return to the idea of individual wish deployment.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.640
Do you write it on your palms?

18:06.640 --> 18:10.960
Do you hold it in your hand like a little butterfly and try not to let the wish go away?

18:12.080 --> 18:14.960
Do you have one wish that you clearly prefer, right?

18:14.960 --> 18:19.200
And maybe that's how the wishbone magic continues is one of the wishes is like, I get a check

18:19.200 --> 18:24.320
for, you know, $10,000 and the other one is like, you know, I don't lose my car keys for

18:24.320 --> 18:27.920
the rest of the year, which you want the money, but either one's a wish.

18:27.920 --> 18:33.120
It's gotta be a blind, a double blind kind of thing where like you put a whole bunch

18:33.120 --> 18:37.760
of wishes in a bowl, you draw two out, you put them in your shoes, you put the shoes

18:37.760 --> 18:39.200
on, you don't look.

18:39.200 --> 18:39.840
Maybe.

18:39.840 --> 18:40.160
Right?

18:40.160 --> 18:45.440
You can't, like literally the right hand can't know what the left hand is doing, right?

18:45.440 --> 18:47.920
Or, and, but here's the thing.

18:47.920 --> 18:53.120
What you do, and this is what they don't tell you, you run the risk of the wishbone

18:53.120 --> 18:55.920
splitting perfectly in half and you die.

18:55.920 --> 18:56.320
Yeah.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.360
That's what it would do.

18:57.360 --> 18:57.680
Wow.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.240
The genie comes out, strangles you.

19:00.240 --> 19:00.800
Yes.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.720
If that kind of power was unleashed.

19:02.720 --> 19:08.240
There's a genie just sort of riding around inside of every turkey's neck just waiting

19:08.240 --> 19:09.200
for his chance.

19:09.200 --> 19:09.700
Yep.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.040
He's like, hey, I have a wish.

19:13.040 --> 19:17.520
As long as, as long as my neck can grant wishes, you know the wish that I have?

19:18.400 --> 19:18.960
Can you guess?

19:18.960 --> 19:23.760
Do you think if a turkey like has an accident, an escape or something, and breaks its neck,

19:23.760 --> 19:24.640
it gets its wish?

19:24.640 --> 19:26.080
Oh, I wish I don't die.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.120
Oh, shit.

19:27.120 --> 19:27.920
Whoa.

19:27.920 --> 19:28.880
I'm fine.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.320
That's how they discovered it.

19:30.320 --> 19:33.120
Then we started harvesting them for their wish powers.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.960
And then we found out they were also delicious.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.080
They're awesome to eat.

19:37.360 --> 19:40.880
We should do something with the rest of this bird and not just use this one bone.

19:40.880 --> 19:41.360
You're right.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.160
Thank you, Todd.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.600
Thank you for saying what we're all thinking.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.440
This is extremely wasteful.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.360
We're just digging this magic bone out.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.320
There's got to be a better way.

19:50.320 --> 19:54.480
Well, I mean, it definitely if you got to think of this Occam's razor style.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.720
They see a turkey doing rad skateboard tricks.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.920
It has a tragic fall, snaps its neck, but then it gets back up.

19:59.920 --> 20:00.880
A wish has been granted.

20:00.880 --> 20:01.680
It's fine.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.440
I don't think the next step is eat it.

20:03.440 --> 20:08.000
I think the next step is let's explore the magical possibilities of the rest of the bones

20:08.000 --> 20:08.800
in this creature.

20:08.800 --> 20:13.680
That's like if, you know, if you saw Superman be invincible, your first thought wouldn't be,

20:13.680 --> 20:14.720
let's eat him.

20:14.720 --> 20:18.400
You would get there eventually, but you'd probably be like, we should study him.

20:18.960 --> 20:25.920
Can you use your losing bone shard to stab your husband right in the neck and then you

20:25.920 --> 20:30.560
claim his winning bone shard and the wish he wanted?

20:30.560 --> 20:34.560
Oh, what if his wish was to lose at the wish bone?

20:35.280 --> 20:36.400
Oh, damn.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.360
I know this riddle.

20:37.360 --> 20:42.080
You have to ask one of the wish bones what the other one will say.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.560
Yeah, how about a question?

20:44.560 --> 20:45.600
I would love that.

20:46.240 --> 20:51.680
My boss and I were talking one day and she told me about her favorite candy bar, which

20:51.680 --> 20:53.280
she said is very hard to find.

20:53.280 --> 20:57.040
The next day, I discovered that my local grocery store happens to carry said candy bar.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.800
So I bought her one as a surprise.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.640
I gave it to her the next day and she seemed genuinely excited.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.840
But then she stashed the candy bar in the freezer at my workstation.

21:05.840 --> 21:09.520
Oh, it's been a week and the candy bar is still in the freezer.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.560
Flowsers.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.520
Can I eat it?

21:12.640 --> 21:14.960
Oh, I didn't expect the question to end like that.

21:14.960 --> 21:15.440
Me neither.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.520
I expected it to be like, hey, what should I do?

21:17.520 --> 21:20.480
Because she's not enjoying my gift the way I envisioned.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.840
That's from a clever, alliterated name in New York City.

21:26.000 --> 21:26.500
Huh.

21:27.840 --> 21:28.340
Yeah.

21:28.880 --> 21:29.380
No.

21:30.240 --> 21:30.740
Justin?

21:32.800 --> 21:33.300
Yeah?

21:33.300 --> 21:34.400
Split the wish bone.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.080
Split the, split the wish bone.

21:37.440 --> 21:37.940
No.

21:38.400 --> 21:38.900
Yeah.

21:39.120 --> 21:44.320
To be fair, when I said yeah, that was, I was referring to the stumpedness of you two.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.200
Oh, I see.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.120
Not me saying, yes, eat.

21:47.120 --> 21:52.960
Because this, if I gave someone a lovely candy bar and they put it on a shelf, perhaps to

21:52.960 --> 21:56.560
display it, I wouldn't then say, well, you missed your window.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.240
It's mine again now.

21:58.240 --> 21:58.880
And eat it.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.000
It is, I will say two things.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.520
One, it's not necessarily a dunk on your candy bar gift.

22:07.520 --> 22:12.400
Some people do like, like, listen, there's a lot of candy I love and I could secure because

22:12.400 --> 22:13.600
I'm a grown man.

22:14.240 --> 22:19.360
But I'm not gonna go out and secure it because if I eat that kind of sugar, that's my week,

22:19.360 --> 22:19.860
gang.

22:19.860 --> 22:20.960
That's it, man.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.880
A Snickers bar would put me in the fucking hospital.

22:24.880 --> 22:25.380
I can't.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.600
I love your candy gift.

22:27.600 --> 22:28.960
Are you trying to kill me?

22:28.960 --> 22:31.520
Because I'm gonna eat this and then I'm gonna go home and be like, well,

22:31.520 --> 22:34.880
that's my whole day and eat an entire box of Lucky Charms.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.960
And then I'll say that's my whole week and that's it.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.800
Yeah, well, let me tell, I would like to take this one step further, right?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.840
Your boss said it's hard to find.

22:43.840 --> 22:44.880
You found one.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.640
What's she supposed to do?

22:46.640 --> 22:48.960
Just go ahead and eat that on any old day of the week?

22:49.520 --> 22:50.240
No, it's special.

22:50.240 --> 22:50.640
It's gotta be special.

22:50.640 --> 22:52.560
It's a hard to find candy bar.

22:52.560 --> 22:57.680
She is saving it for when you guys, I don't know, land the big account or whatever and

22:57.680 --> 22:59.120
save the business.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.080
Or the big meteor.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.200
The big meteor is gonna fall.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.560
When the big meteor is gonna fall and you land the big meteor and save the business.

23:06.080 --> 23:10.000
You blow up the big meteor and save the business and everybody else on planet earth.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.400
And they're like, hey, you did it, digital media startup company.

23:14.400 --> 23:18.560
You say you destroyed that meteor because it was easier to train you to be astronauts

23:18.560 --> 23:21.680
than train astronauts to be digital media executives or whatever.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.000
I'm not done.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.280
You blow up the meteor and then candy bar time.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.080
Okay, now I'm done.

23:28.080 --> 23:32.000
I have to share with you all this visceral reaction I'm having to this question.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.360
I can't explain why it's so powerful, but since we have started discussing it, I can't

23:37.840 --> 23:42.640
I can't stop thinking about and imagining and envisioning so much so that I feel like

23:42.640 --> 23:49.680
it's actually happening in my actual mouth and body, the thought of eating a Three Musketeers

23:49.680 --> 23:54.960
bar like now, like a king size Three Musketeers bar now as a 31 year old adult.

23:54.960 --> 24:00.960
Just the feeling of gomming down all of that sweet nougat and like what that would feel like, taste like.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.960
Is that a pleasant feeling in your experience?

24:02.960 --> 24:04.560
No, no, no, it's quite bad, quite bad.

24:04.560 --> 24:08.560
I'm saying in trying to ingest that truck bed full of nougat.

24:08.560 --> 24:10.720
I'm just envisioning what it would like.

24:10.720 --> 24:14.880
I it's obviously it's a fancy fantasy land if I actually try to do that.

24:14.880 --> 24:20.240
Like I would need to be standing in front of my own open grave just kind of topple over into it.

24:20.240 --> 24:23.280
I'm just thinking about trying to get all that nougat down.

24:23.280 --> 24:26.000
It's like a fucking survivor challenge in my mind.

24:26.000 --> 24:33.520
Sometimes I think about this, how I do this where I'll open a candy bar, I will eat, let's say, a third of it

24:33.520 --> 24:38.240
and then kind of fold the wrapper back over it and place it somewhere.

24:38.240 --> 24:44.480
And I just picture like nine year old Travis just like crying and weeping at what I have become.

24:44.480 --> 24:50.960
Like you can't finish a candy, like we took BB trick-or-treating, which means I got a lot of candy.

24:50.960 --> 24:56.480
And like the fun-sized bars, I was like, oh, thank God.

24:56.480 --> 25:00.560
But for me, those are not even fun-sized anymore.

25:00.560 --> 25:05.680
What would be fun-sized is like a little amuse-bouche of Snickers served out of a tiny spoon.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.440
Give me that technology, Marsh.

25:07.440 --> 25:11.040
When I was a young man and I was selling candy for a fundraiser

25:11.040 --> 25:16.480
and I sold a packet of Skittles to my Spanish professor, Senora Berry.

25:16.480 --> 25:24.320
And upon the next arrival at the beginning of class, she told me how much she enjoyed the Skittles.

25:24.320 --> 25:28.400
And then she told me she had to cut the Skittles in half because they were so extremely sweet.

25:28.400 --> 25:32.320
And friends, I'm here to tell you, I'm saying this with a lot of shame in my heart.

25:32.320 --> 25:36.000
I laughed in her face that day, that Dia, if you will.

25:36.000 --> 25:41.600
And I feel a lot of regret about that because at this point in my life, I get it, Senora Berry.

25:41.600 --> 25:45.920
I'm sorry if you're out there listening. Thank you so much. I'm sorry for laughing at you.

25:45.920 --> 25:50.400
Now I'm experiencing deja vu because either we've talked about that explicitly on this show before

25:50.400 --> 25:52.640
or somebody just changed something in The Matrix.

25:54.080 --> 25:58.240
When I was a kid, I sold candy bars for band and they were those kind of like,

25:58.240 --> 26:01.600
not name brand, just kind of silver with a white wrapper.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.240
And some kind of like, it just said like crackle.

26:04.240 --> 26:09.040
But I, out of like the 30 bars, ate 20 of them myself.

26:09.040 --> 26:09.920
Hell yeah.

26:09.920 --> 26:11.840
And then I had to go to mom and dad and say like,

26:11.840 --> 26:16.640
hey, I need to borrow $20 to cover my debt fucking high on my own supply gang.

26:17.840 --> 26:21.600
And like, I think about that now and like,

26:23.440 --> 26:28.400
I might as well have eaten 20 rocks as far as I'm concerned now as an adult.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.400
Now at KitKat, I can fuck with.

26:30.400 --> 26:33.760
KitKat, you can, the catchphrase, give me a break.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.160
For me, that is prescriptive in a way.

26:37.200 --> 26:38.800
It's pre-portioned.

26:38.800 --> 26:39.120
Yes.

26:39.120 --> 26:42.080
Sometimes I cut the Reese's in half.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.760
I can't eat a whole Reese's cup.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.400
What is this, Christmas?

26:46.400 --> 26:48.160
Let's step out of the candy corner.

26:48.160 --> 26:48.880
Okay.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.960
I'm starting to get comfy.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.240
No, let's do a quick Yahoo.

26:52.240 --> 26:52.480
Okay.

26:52.480 --> 26:55.280
Because I don't think this will give us much room to play in the space.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.800
I want you guys to play with me.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.080
I just don't think it's going to be possible.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.280
I just really want to explore this.

26:59.280 --> 27:00.480
It was sent in by Ian.

27:00.480 --> 27:01.280
Thank you, Ian.

27:01.280 --> 27:05.600
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call Poppy who asks,

27:05.600 --> 27:12.160
is it possible to drink water without making any throat sounds at all?

27:13.280 --> 27:13.760
Huh.

27:13.760 --> 27:14.960
I don't want to name names.

27:15.520 --> 27:26.480
I have edited at this point approximately 520 maybe plus hours of all of us.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.680
Out of this episode?

27:28.160 --> 27:30.400
No, out of all of the podcasts we've ever done.

27:30.400 --> 27:34.320
I just thought about that number and my butthole puckered up deep, deep.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.760
It's deep down up inside of me.

27:35.760 --> 27:41.440
Some of us, I don't want to name names, make pretty bad throat noises when they drink.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.040
It makes me think that the throat is putting-

27:43.040 --> 27:43.680
Is it me?

27:43.680 --> 27:44.160
No.

27:44.160 --> 27:44.720
Is it me?

27:45.920 --> 27:46.720
It's not Travis.

27:46.720 --> 27:54.000
It makes me think your throat is doing extra work.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.560
It makes me think your throat, when the water hits it, it gets panicked and every muscle

27:58.560 --> 28:02.320
in your throat is like, get this shit down to the tummy.

28:02.320 --> 28:10.480
Maybe one of us is drinking chunkier water than the rest of us.

28:10.480 --> 28:15.760
It's possible that West Virginia water is maybe it's got a lot of protein in it.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.280
It's got a lot of minerals.

28:17.280 --> 28:18.320
It's possible.

28:18.320 --> 28:23.920
Part of it is if I work up the nerve to drink some water, I feel like I better make it really

28:23.920 --> 28:25.920
count because I'm already here.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.520
I better see how much I can get inside.

28:28.160 --> 28:28.720
Yeah, sure.

28:28.720 --> 28:33.360
I actually like the noise, Justin.

28:33.360 --> 28:38.320
It's to the point where it's like, I can't sleep without my wife snoring situation.

28:40.720 --> 28:45.040
Is there anything we can do just to make the edit a little bit easier to make that water

28:45.040 --> 28:47.840
go down completely silently?

28:47.840 --> 28:48.080
Okay.

28:48.080 --> 28:52.480
Well, I have a bottle of water here and I'm going to turn up.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.560
I'm going to put my microphone right in my throat.

28:54.560 --> 28:58.880
Yeah, just put your glottis right up against the microphone.

28:58.880 --> 29:02.000
Just to see if you're full of shit.

29:02.000 --> 29:02.640
Give me the base.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.880
I'm just going to give you a base line.

29:04.880 --> 29:05.600
A big swig too.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.800
Don't take no baby sips.

29:11.440 --> 29:17.760
This is the sort of heat that I have to touch with my special gloves every week, sometimes

29:17.760 --> 29:18.480
twice a week.

29:19.520 --> 29:24.240
Justin, how would you feel about if we installed within your throat some sort of sluice

29:24.240 --> 29:32.880
situation where we could completely bypass any swallowing muscles and you would just

29:32.880 --> 29:34.240
pour it down a wooden track?

29:34.240 --> 29:36.800
I saw an episode of ER once.

29:36.800 --> 29:40.560
I think it was George Clooney did a tracheotomy with a ballpoint pen.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.120
I think you might be thinking of scrubs.

29:43.120 --> 29:43.440
Yeah.

29:43.440 --> 29:44.240
Or the good doctor.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.200
There's a lot of possibilities.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.400
It's hard to say, but I-

29:46.400 --> 29:47.600
It might be Grey's Anatomy.

29:47.600 --> 29:50.960
I'm saying if you could do that with a pen, you could certainly do that with a Capri Sun

29:50.960 --> 29:55.520
straw and just kind of hook you up to Capri Sun, right?

29:55.520 --> 30:00.880
I mean, we could get less gory with it and just hook you up with a proboscis.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.080
And then it's up to you whenever you want to use it.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.080
Well, but then you might have to deal with this kind of noise.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.600
Dip in.

30:07.600 --> 30:10.800
Do you hear noises when you're drinking a full drink with a straw?

30:10.800 --> 30:11.600
Not usually.

30:11.600 --> 30:16.640
What about just like a beer bong, but the end of it connects to his belly button and

30:16.640 --> 30:18.320
just goes straight inside his tummy?

30:18.320 --> 30:21.040
This is obviously the best imaginable scenario, Travis.

30:21.040 --> 30:21.520
Yes.

30:21.520 --> 30:28.240
I was about to suggest that I could try to do it silently, but I feel like if I succeeded,

30:29.200 --> 30:32.800
that would be not great for me because then if the noise ever happened, it would feel

30:32.800 --> 30:35.120
very intentional and threatening.

30:36.000 --> 30:41.520
Is it possible that you could just sleep not in your bed where you traditionally sleep,

30:41.520 --> 30:47.840
but in like a kiddie pool full of like water with a little bit of glucose in it or something,

30:47.840 --> 30:52.880
and you absorb through your skin like a froggy frog all the water that you need throughout

30:52.880 --> 30:53.360
the day?

30:53.360 --> 30:56.960
And that's going to be actually juice pretty fucking efficient if you think about it.

30:56.960 --> 30:57.760
That would be nice.

30:57.760 --> 31:00.320
You know, it doesn't even just have to be at night.

31:00.320 --> 31:06.240
If we could build some kind of like pod where your head is out and you're able to speak

31:06.240 --> 31:12.720
into the microphone, but inside of the pod is just your body osmosis-ing water all the

31:12.720 --> 31:12.960
time.

31:12.960 --> 31:13.360
Oh, shit.

31:13.360 --> 31:13.920
Flip it.

31:13.920 --> 31:14.400
Flip it.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.520
Flip that shit.

31:15.520 --> 31:17.760
Flip that shit around.

31:17.760 --> 31:23.440
I'm imagining a sort of beanbag-sized apparatus or perhaps a like a punching bag that boxers

31:23.440 --> 31:24.240
use to get strong.

31:24.240 --> 31:25.200
What are they doing with that thing?

31:25.200 --> 31:26.080
Getting stronger?

31:26.080 --> 31:26.720
I don't think so.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.160
Toughing up their knuckles.

31:28.160 --> 31:28.960
Yeah, I guess so.

31:28.960 --> 31:31.600
One of those, it's about that size, but it's full of water.

31:32.160 --> 31:35.760
And we hang that up next to Justin's desk.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.920
And then whenever you need to take a drink of water, Justin, your whole body can enter

31:39.920 --> 31:42.000
it and you just drink in there.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.480
And I guarantee you, no sound's going to escape.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.840
Ooh, I like that.

31:45.840 --> 31:52.160
What if, beginning of the week, like a train, Justin moves under a big water tower, we open

31:52.160 --> 31:56.720
it, it pours down his throat, and he has all of his water for the week in one go.

31:56.720 --> 31:57.440
That works too.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.320
So you get to pick now.

32:00.320 --> 32:00.640
Yeah.

32:01.920 --> 32:05.120
Boy, we spent a lot of time sort of criticizing the old train man.

32:06.640 --> 32:07.840
Not really criticizing.

32:07.840 --> 32:08.880
It was fun.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.840
I remember distinctly it being fun for a second.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.520
Yeah.

32:13.520 --> 32:21.600
I think the easy fix juice is just put some water in your mouth and then sort of tilt

32:21.600 --> 32:26.080
your head upward, but don't do anything with your muscles.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.520
No muscular work at all.

32:27.520 --> 32:33.120
Yeah, just let the water fall down your neck.

32:33.120 --> 32:34.240
Do you know what I'm saying?

32:34.240 --> 32:35.440
And that's going to be better for you.

32:35.440 --> 32:39.200
It's going to, like when you have a sore throat, like no ish at all because the water just

32:39.200 --> 32:42.240
kind of falls down you.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.200
Give that a spin now.

32:43.600 --> 32:43.920
Okay.

32:45.040 --> 32:45.920
Give that a spin for me.

32:45.920 --> 32:46.880
No swallowing?

32:47.440 --> 32:49.200
No muscular movement at all.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.280
Yeah, you're going to swallow.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.520
Now juice, juice, juice, wait before you do it.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.480
The water's going to want to go down your lung holes.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.160
Okay, close those off.

32:58.160 --> 32:58.640
Close those off.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.240
Think about not doing that.

33:00.240 --> 33:00.480
Yeah.

33:00.480 --> 33:00.800
Okay.

33:00.800 --> 33:01.040
Yes.

33:01.040 --> 33:01.600
Okay, here we go.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.100
Yeah.

33:08.800 --> 33:09.680
It got worse?

33:09.680 --> 33:10.720
Yeah, this is worse.

33:10.720 --> 33:11.200
It's worse.

33:11.200 --> 33:11.600
It's worse.

33:11.600 --> 33:12.480
Let's go to the Money Zone.

33:24.080 --> 33:24.800
I don't want to talk.

33:24.800 --> 33:25.360
You guys talk.

33:26.640 --> 33:27.120
Yeah, sure.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.520
I imagine you've done a number on your most of your-

33:29.520 --> 33:31.040
I need to get my human body back in order here.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.640
... your vital organs.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.720
Hey, I want to tell you all about Squarespace.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.080
Bad timing on this one.

33:36.080 --> 33:36.960
Whoops-a-daisy.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.400
Squarespace is fantastic.

33:40.400 --> 33:43.840
Squarespace allows you to build a beautiful website you can use to showcase your work,

33:43.840 --> 33:48.320
announce an upcoming event or special project to promote your physical or online business,

33:48.320 --> 33:49.360
and more.

33:49.360 --> 33:53.600
True, yes, we do have a new website elsewhere, but I still use Squarespace for my personal

33:53.600 --> 33:53.920
website.

33:53.920 --> 33:55.200
It was super easy to put together.

33:55.760 --> 33:59.120
Travis has set up Buttercup is a good, good-

33:59.120 --> 34:01.040
Buttercup is a verygoodgirl.com.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.720
Yeah, that's a Squarespace joint.

34:02.720 --> 34:06.480
If you want to make a website and you want to make it fucking now and you want it to

34:06.480 --> 34:12.080
look awesome and you want it to have e-commerce functionality and analytics and built-in search

34:12.080 --> 34:18.160
engine optimization and award-winning customer support 24 hours a day, I mean, you got Squarespace.

34:18.160 --> 34:19.600
Squarespace is tops.

34:19.600 --> 34:20.320
And let me say this.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.520
We have got ourselves a second dog.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.560
Her name is Lily.

34:24.560 --> 34:27.280
She is also a verygoodgirl.com.

34:27.280 --> 34:32.560
And as soon as I get enough pictures of her, I will be building another Squarespace website

34:32.560 --> 34:34.400
called lilyisaveverygoodgirl.com.

34:34.400 --> 34:37.360
I should go buy that now before this episode goes up.

34:37.360 --> 34:37.680
Yes.

34:37.680 --> 34:39.600
And just go ahead and sit on that.

34:39.600 --> 34:43.680
I mean, the real competition, I think, is you need to do it before Justin does it because

34:43.680 --> 34:44.000
he-

34:44.000 --> 34:44.640
Oh, no.

34:44.640 --> 34:47.520
Yeah, the juice, the race is on if you've recovered and are able to use it.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.600
He's going to be way faster at it than me.

34:49.600 --> 34:52.640
So go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

34:52.640 --> 34:56.560
And when you're ready to launch, use the offer code MYBROTHER, all one word, to save 10%

34:56.560 --> 34:58.640
off your first purchase of a website or domain.

35:00.480 --> 35:01.040
Oh, sorry.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.400
I'm racing Justin.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.400
Yeah, I can't wait to see the results of this.

35:04.400 --> 35:05.360
I'm just going to lose it.

35:05.360 --> 35:06.160
He needs this.

35:06.720 --> 35:07.760
I need it?

35:07.760 --> 35:09.280
I don't need your charity.

35:10.720 --> 35:11.680
I don't need your charity.

35:12.480 --> 35:15.040
Okay, then you read the next one while I get it.

35:15.680 --> 35:15.920
All right.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.040
Yeah, you grab it, Trav.

35:17.040 --> 35:17.840
Go for it, bud.

35:18.960 --> 35:19.760
Get it, Trav.

35:19.760 --> 35:20.160
Get it.

35:20.160 --> 35:20.800
I don't have it.

35:21.680 --> 35:22.000
Oh, no.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.040
Did you already get it?

35:23.040 --> 35:24.480
You having any troubles getting it, bud?

35:25.120 --> 35:25.920
Did you already get it?

35:25.920 --> 35:27.920
Oh, bud, I got it three weeks ago, bud.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.360
No, I got it when you adopted the dog, bud.

35:32.240 --> 35:32.880
Oh, no.

35:32.880 --> 35:37.760
You shouldn't have texted me that you're getting a dog before you got to the URL of your dog.

35:38.480 --> 35:39.040
Obviously.

35:41.120 --> 35:43.040
So Justin can now hook that up to whatever he wants.

35:43.040 --> 35:45.200
I'm going to read the next ad because you guys are taking too long.

35:46.080 --> 35:46.800
It's Quip.

35:46.800 --> 35:47.600
Quip is great.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.840
Everybody, I think all of us have a Quip toothbrush.

35:49.840 --> 35:50.720
I certainly do.

35:50.720 --> 35:54.160
And it's my sort of main bathroom bud.

35:54.160 --> 35:56.480
I use it and it fits in the mouth quite nice.

35:56.480 --> 35:59.040
And it gets all the nasty stuff off there.

36:00.080 --> 36:01.200
And it's fun.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.320
I tell you my favorite thing about it.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.800
We travel pretty much nonstop these days.

36:04.800 --> 36:05.920
And it is so easy.

36:05.920 --> 36:10.560
It's got this little case that you stick onto your mirror and you put your toothbrush in it.

36:10.560 --> 36:13.600
And then whenever you want to travel, it comes off the mirror and then the case

36:14.320 --> 36:16.000
covers up the sensitive bristles.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.280
And so you just take it right with you.

36:17.280 --> 36:17.680
It's a great travel toothbrush.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.120
Also, it's an electric toothbrush.

36:19.120 --> 36:20.400
Yes, it's an electric toothbrush too.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.680
I don't know if I said that, which is great.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.400
I would not fuck with an analog toothbrush at this point.

36:24.400 --> 36:29.040
Anyway, Quip is the gift that keeps refreshing with brush heads automatically delivered on

36:29.040 --> 36:32.160
a dentist recommended schedule every three months for just $5.

36:32.160 --> 36:39.440
I just got my first refill and I am never that diligent about re-upping my toothbrush game.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.760
And it's so nice just getting those stiff bristles.

36:41.760 --> 36:42.960
You know what my favorite thing about it is?

36:42.960 --> 36:47.280
When you get the new one, you pop off the old one and it says in the instructions,

36:47.280 --> 36:51.440
use the old one to clean it up to make it feel like a new toothbrush again.

36:51.440 --> 36:51.920
It's genius.

36:52.480 --> 36:56.400
I'm also on the plan where I get a AAA battery with it also.

36:56.400 --> 36:57.440
Yeah, they don't recharge.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.120
Like you don't have to fucking worry about that.

36:59.120 --> 37:01.520
You just pop like one AAA into it, I think.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.640
It's weird flags, but okay.

37:03.760 --> 37:07.440
So lilyisaveverygoodgirl.com is taken.

37:07.440 --> 37:11.680
Yeah, so Quip is, it looks like a big ticket tech gift with a stocking stuffer price starting

37:11.680 --> 37:12.320
at just $25.

37:12.960 --> 37:17.360
Go to getquip.com slash my brother and get your first refill pack for free with a Quip

37:17.360 --> 37:18.400
electric toothbrush.

37:18.400 --> 37:22.720
That's your first refill pack free at getquip.com slash my brother.

37:23.840 --> 37:29.040
So now I assume, Justin, I'm going to have to pay you or it may be a bidding war.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.320
Off mic.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.000
We'll figure it out.

37:32.880 --> 37:37.040
Hey, if you like your podcast to be focused and well researched and your podcast host

37:37.040 --> 37:41.120
to be uncharismatic, unhorny strangers who have no interest in horses, then this is not

37:41.120 --> 37:42.240
the podcast for you.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.120
Yeah, and what's your deal?

37:44.320 --> 37:45.200
I'm Emily.

37:45.200 --> 37:45.920
I'm Lisa.

37:45.920 --> 37:47.600
Our show is called Baby Geniuses.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.680
And its hosts are horny adult idiots.

37:49.680 --> 37:52.640
We discover weird Wikipedia pages every episode.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.960
We discuss institutional misogyny.

37:54.960 --> 37:58.880
We ask each other the dumbest questions and our listeners won't stop sending us pictures

37:58.880 --> 37:59.600
of their butts.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.560
We haven't asked them to stop, but they also aren't stopping.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.560
Join us on Baby Geniuses.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.640
Every other week on MaximumFun.org.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.680
I want a munch.

38:14.320 --> 38:14.820
Squad.

38:14.820 --> 38:18.900
I want too much.

38:18.900 --> 38:19.400
Squad.

38:22.980 --> 38:26.340
This is a little bit different from Munch Squad because it's not about a menu innovation.

38:27.540 --> 38:31.860
And it's not even a lot of like bizarre PR speak.

38:32.580 --> 38:39.940
I just want to give it up to Burger King for going so hard.

38:41.140 --> 38:42.020
Two in a row.

38:42.020 --> 38:45.300
I'm going to give you the first one that's a little less amazing.

38:45.300 --> 38:47.380
Burger King introduces the dog purr.

38:49.380 --> 38:50.340
You need to say that again.

38:50.340 --> 38:53.300
I need you to really hit the consonants a little bit harder.

38:53.300 --> 38:55.460
Burger King introduces the dog purr.

38:56.660 --> 38:57.620
Dog purr.

38:57.620 --> 38:57.940
Dog purr.

38:57.940 --> 38:59.940
D-O-G-P-U-R.

38:59.940 --> 39:02.420
Instead of wa, there's dog.

39:04.740 --> 39:05.860
Oh Lord, take me now.

39:06.980 --> 39:08.420
Take me into your blessed kingdom.

39:08.420 --> 39:13.220
It's a special flame grilled bone for your dog.

39:13.940 --> 39:15.140
Oh, thank you.

39:15.140 --> 39:19.860
If you get it through Door Dash, then you're going to get a free one.

39:20.660 --> 39:22.020
Because they're going to bring it to your house.

39:22.020 --> 39:22.980
They're going to bring your food.

39:22.980 --> 39:26.100
Then got a little something for your four-legged friend.

39:26.100 --> 39:31.220
A little BK for a little Burger King for your king, Rex.

39:31.220 --> 39:33.780
Yeah, I don't have one of those.

39:33.780 --> 39:35.700
So what am I supposed to do with this?

39:35.700 --> 39:36.260
You eat it.

39:36.900 --> 39:38.100
No, stop.

39:38.100 --> 39:38.500
Stop.

39:38.500 --> 39:39.540
I want you guys to stop.

39:39.540 --> 39:41.460
And I want you to really use your fucking noggins.

39:41.460 --> 39:42.900
I want you to think about this.

39:42.900 --> 39:45.300
I would bet that a lot of people don't have dogs.

39:45.300 --> 39:46.820
I would say that if you're the type of person

39:46.820 --> 39:50.500
that has to order Burger King remotely,

39:50.500 --> 39:53.620
you're probably not in a place sort of in your life

39:53.620 --> 39:55.700
where you can support a dog.

39:55.700 --> 39:58.500
And so with that in mind, Burger King will deliver

39:58.500 --> 40:01.940
their hamburgers to you and a bone.

40:01.940 --> 40:03.620
This is fantastic news for me.

40:04.340 --> 40:04.820
Yes.

40:04.820 --> 40:05.700
It is good.

40:05.700 --> 40:09.540
I do question most fast food hamburgers are inedible

40:09.540 --> 40:11.300
before you leave the parking lot.

40:11.300 --> 40:13.540
You have about a 30 second freshness window

40:13.540 --> 40:15.700
to enjoy them and pretend you're eating food.

40:15.700 --> 40:17.300
But I cannot imagine it's like, well,

40:17.300 --> 40:18.900
it's been in my trunk for 20 minutes.

40:18.900 --> 40:19.860
So happy to be here.

40:19.860 --> 40:21.540
Please enjoy your food.

40:22.260 --> 40:23.620
Adjacent to a bone.

40:25.300 --> 40:28.180
They are not saying where these bones are coming from.

40:28.180 --> 40:28.740
Yes.

40:28.740 --> 40:30.180
Now, here's the thing, Griffin.

40:30.180 --> 40:32.820
If you don't have a dog for your dog purr,

40:32.820 --> 40:36.820
you can save them up and build an anatomically correct

40:36.820 --> 40:37.780
edible skeleton.

40:38.660 --> 40:39.380
Did you know that?

40:40.580 --> 40:41.300
For who?

40:41.300 --> 40:42.900
And I don't think they're delivering skulls.

40:42.900 --> 40:43.620
For the king.

40:43.620 --> 40:44.900
Yeah, they're not delivering.

40:44.900 --> 40:45.700
If you have two dogs now.

40:45.700 --> 40:49.140
No, you have to find this skull in a whimsical

40:49.140 --> 40:50.500
cross country adventure.

40:52.100 --> 40:53.780
I have a second.

40:53.780 --> 40:55.940
So like that, they came out with that, right?

40:56.660 --> 40:57.620
Legit.

40:57.620 --> 41:01.540
And then this just came out yesterday or any before.

41:01.540 --> 41:04.180
It's the Whopper Detour.

41:04.180 --> 41:06.340
And folks, I fucking love this.

41:06.340 --> 41:06.580
Okay.

41:07.780 --> 41:09.060
Do you already know about it, Griffin?

41:09.700 --> 41:13.620
No, it's just the name makes me think that you're on the

41:13.620 --> 41:16.660
Ural and you're taking a trip through the Mediterranean.

41:16.660 --> 41:17.540
So here it is.

41:18.180 --> 41:22.820
You can get, from now until December 12th,

41:22.820 --> 41:26.500
you can get a Burger King Whopper.

41:26.500 --> 41:29.220
If you order it through the Burger King app,

41:29.220 --> 41:32.020
you can get a Whopper for one cent.

41:33.780 --> 41:36.820
The trick of it is though, you're going to love this.

41:36.820 --> 41:40.100
The trick of it is, you got to order it at McDonald's.

41:41.380 --> 41:42.020
What?

41:42.020 --> 41:42.980
What?

41:42.980 --> 41:49.300
You have to go to McDonald's, activate the Burger King app.

41:49.300 --> 41:49.860
What?

41:49.860 --> 41:51.380
You have to go to McDonald's.

41:51.380 --> 41:53.940
You have to turn on your Burger King app.

41:53.940 --> 41:56.980
And if you're within 600 feet of a McDonald's,

41:56.980 --> 41:59.620
you can order a Whopper for a penny.

41:59.620 --> 42:02.500
It's so fucking good.

42:02.500 --> 42:06.020
I would please do go through the drive-through.

42:06.020 --> 42:07.620
You have to go through the drive-through.

42:07.620 --> 42:08.340
Like, what do you need?

42:08.340 --> 42:11.220
Like, just your GPS coordinates, I guess,

42:11.220 --> 42:13.140
because I'm getting a Whopper for a penny.

42:17.140 --> 42:18.660
This is very, this is-

42:18.660 --> 42:19.860
It's not even an ironic one.

42:19.860 --> 42:23.700
Did the Jackass crew become like the new marketing team

42:23.700 --> 42:24.740
for Burger King?

42:24.740 --> 42:29.300
Like, these seem like pranks to me.

42:29.300 --> 42:30.340
It is a prank.

42:31.140 --> 42:32.020
It's a prank.

42:32.820 --> 42:38.180
You can order it at almost all of the McDonald's 14,000 locations.

42:38.180 --> 42:38.980
You can get yourself-

42:41.140 --> 42:42.980
The poster for this is extremely good.

42:43.540 --> 42:45.780
It's the McDonald's sign kind of blurred out,

42:45.780 --> 42:48.260
and it just says, billion swerved,

42:48.260 --> 42:49.940
because they fucking got you.

42:49.940 --> 42:51.140
Oh, shit.

42:51.140 --> 42:53.060
They got you, McDonald's.

42:53.060 --> 42:53.860
Holy shit.

42:53.860 --> 42:55.620
That's really good, actually.

42:55.620 --> 42:59.940
Yeah, we're enjoying this in a very direct and unironic way,

42:59.940 --> 43:01.780
which I'm not super comfortable about.

43:03.540 --> 43:06.740
But I feel like McDonald's and Burger King

43:06.740 --> 43:09.940
have a sort of mutually assured destruction,

43:09.940 --> 43:14.100
sort of stalemate demilitarized zone between them right now.

43:14.100 --> 43:18.260
This is clearly an act of organized aggression

43:18.260 --> 43:22.420
that, like, I am terrified of what the repercussions of this,

43:22.420 --> 43:24.100
what McDonald's is going to do to answer.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.860
Oh, God, you're right, Griffin.

43:27.860 --> 43:28.900
This is going to escalate.

43:28.900 --> 43:29.940
It is going to escalate.

43:29.940 --> 43:30.580
That's true.

43:30.580 --> 43:33.140
This is the beginning of an arms race.

43:35.860 --> 43:37.540
If you burn down a Burger King,

43:37.540 --> 43:39.460
you get free McDonald's for life.

43:40.100 --> 43:41.860
No, don't say that, Griffin.

43:43.700 --> 43:44.420
I'm not done.

43:44.980 --> 43:45.780
I'm not done.

43:45.780 --> 43:47.860
The swerve's extremely good,

43:47.860 --> 43:50.340
but this year, and this one's already come and gone,

43:50.340 --> 43:54.020
this year, Burger King also opened whoppershopper.com.

43:55.620 --> 43:57.780
What's whoppershopper.com, you ask?

43:57.780 --> 43:59.540
Well, it launched for Black Friday

43:59.540 --> 44:00.820
and went till Cyber Monday.

44:00.820 --> 44:02.660
So it was real great.

44:02.660 --> 44:03.940
It's a quick deal.

44:03.940 --> 44:07.780
It was a site heavily populated by banner ads

44:07.780 --> 44:08.980
from different brands.

44:09.700 --> 44:12.580
And then you would put in the name of the brands

44:12.580 --> 44:14.100
that are being advertised there.

44:14.100 --> 44:17.780
And then because every time someone would click on the site,

44:18.340 --> 44:19.940
Burger King would earn money.

44:19.940 --> 44:22.660
And then they would give that money direct to free whoppers.

44:22.660 --> 44:25.860
So you would go to whopper-shopper.com

44:25.860 --> 44:30.020
and demand that brands buy you hamburgers

44:31.620 --> 44:34.020
in exchange for clicking on their banner ads.

44:35.620 --> 44:37.220
Thanks, Dick's Sporting Goods.

44:37.220 --> 44:38.100
Thanks, Dick's.

44:38.980 --> 44:40.820
Does the presence of a Munchquad in this episode

44:40.820 --> 44:43.300
mean we are not also getting That's a Christmas to me?

44:43.300 --> 44:43.860
It does.

44:43.860 --> 44:48.260
My wife and I have not had time to craft a new Hallmark film.

44:48.260 --> 44:49.140
I'm sorry.

44:49.140 --> 44:50.340
Let's answer another question.

44:50.340 --> 44:51.220
How's that sound to y'all?

44:51.940 --> 44:52.820
Yeah, is it?

44:52.820 --> 44:54.580
Yeah, regular question time.

44:54.580 --> 44:56.820
Recently, my close friend texted me

44:56.820 --> 44:58.980
asking if I still had Pokemon cards.

44:58.980 --> 44:59.700
Of course I do.

45:00.340 --> 45:04.180
Specifically, she wanted to know if I had a holographic Zapdos.

45:05.140 --> 45:06.500
Don't pretend like you don't know the word.

45:06.500 --> 45:07.460
I don't, bud.

45:07.460 --> 45:08.420
I don't.

45:08.420 --> 45:10.740
I never even finished one of those fucking things.

45:10.740 --> 45:13.140
And if so, if I was willing to part with it.

45:13.140 --> 45:15.860
I immediately and excitedly told her that I did.

45:15.860 --> 45:17.540
And of course she could have it for free.

45:17.540 --> 45:19.220
After a brief eBay search,

45:19.220 --> 45:21.380
I've realized that the version of the card I have

45:21.380 --> 45:22.980
is actually worth a good amount of money.

45:23.780 --> 45:24.580
What should I do?

45:25.140 --> 45:26.820
Do I still have to give it to her?

45:26.820 --> 45:28.260
Do I have to ask for some kind of payment?

45:28.820 --> 45:31.300
Or do I sell it on eBay for all it's worth?

45:31.300 --> 45:34.100
And this is from Pokemon Master in Medford.

45:34.100 --> 45:35.940
This is actually a good one.

45:35.940 --> 45:39.540
Let's, let's, can we, I hate to ask this

45:39.540 --> 45:40.740
this close to the holidays.

45:40.740 --> 45:43.300
Do you guys mind if we send jokes out of the room

45:43.300 --> 45:45.540
for a couple of minutes to really just hash through this?

45:45.540 --> 45:47.780
Oh yeah, jokes.

45:47.780 --> 45:48.820
Jokes, get out of here.

45:48.820 --> 45:49.620
Go have a sandwich.

45:49.620 --> 45:53.140
Go have a Burger King Whopper on us jokes.

45:55.140 --> 45:56.900
Let's take away, let's abstract this.

45:56.900 --> 45:57.400
Okay.

45:58.020 --> 46:00.180
I think about the, if my memory serves,

46:00.180 --> 46:02.500
I'm not as plugged into the market as I once was,

46:02.500 --> 46:05.460
but I think street value on a holographic Zapdos,

46:06.020 --> 46:10.740
if it's first edition, we're talking about 75 to $100.

46:10.740 --> 46:11.780
We sent jokes out of the room.

46:11.780 --> 46:13.140
I'm just gonna check the bay.

46:13.140 --> 46:14.020
I'll just check the bay.

46:14.020 --> 46:17.540
Yeah, see, see, see if I'm, see if I'm close.

46:18.420 --> 46:21.140
So if that's the case, if your friend says,

46:21.140 --> 46:23.620
hey, do you have 75 to $100?

46:23.620 --> 46:25.380
And you say, yes.

46:25.380 --> 46:27.220
And they say, are you willing to part with it?

46:27.220 --> 46:28.260
And you say, yes.

46:28.820 --> 46:31.060
You can't really walk that back, I feel like.

46:31.620 --> 46:36.020
There is a sort of wild variance on this.

46:37.940 --> 46:39.140
It looks like there is a, Griffin,

46:40.100 --> 46:42.340
just will you look Griffin, because you could probably like

46:42.340 --> 46:44.980
yeah, decode this a little better than I could.

46:44.980 --> 46:45.780
What did you search for?

46:45.780 --> 46:47.700
Holographic Zapdos.

46:48.420 --> 46:48.920
Okay.

46:49.700 --> 46:51.300
Yeah, I mean, we got some pre-owned ones

46:51.300 --> 46:53.060
that look a little dingy, a little beat up.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.500
They could also be fake.

46:54.500 --> 46:56.100
Some of them are from sun and moons.

46:56.100 --> 46:57.140
They're not first edition.

46:57.140 --> 46:58.980
Those are the ones you're looking at that are like $1.

46:59.860 --> 47:01.940
Then you start getting into the base set,

47:01.940 --> 47:03.460
first gen holographic Zapdos.

47:03.460 --> 47:04.740
You're talking about $65.

47:04.740 --> 47:06.660
Here's a buy it now for 275.

47:06.660 --> 47:07.460
Here's a 200.

47:08.180 --> 47:08.660
Here's more.

47:08.660 --> 47:13.300
Here's more what I was looking at about 85, 84, 95, 100.

47:13.300 --> 47:14.980
That's about the, that's about where you're going.

47:14.980 --> 47:15.620
So there's some core.

47:15.620 --> 47:17.780
I mean, there's some serious coin on the line.

47:17.780 --> 47:18.020
Yeah.

47:18.020 --> 47:18.260
Okay.

47:19.220 --> 47:20.180
And you know what?

47:20.820 --> 47:22.260
Some serious Zapdos.

47:22.260 --> 47:24.580
We can't just sort of look at the monetary value.

47:24.580 --> 47:26.020
We've got to look at the strategic value.

47:26.020 --> 47:26.820
This thing can play.

47:26.820 --> 47:28.180
This thing can do thunder.

47:28.180 --> 47:29.140
That's 60 damage.

47:29.140 --> 47:30.900
It can also use Thunderbolt for 100 damage.

47:30.900 --> 47:33.540
Like this is a fucking powerful car.

47:33.540 --> 47:34.500
It's a powerhouse.

47:35.140 --> 47:35.700
Yeah.

47:35.700 --> 47:38.180
I guess the thing that I'm left wondering

47:38.180 --> 47:40.260
and Griffin maybe you can give some insight to this.

47:41.220 --> 47:46.500
Why would your friend call and ask you for Zapdos

47:46.500 --> 47:49.540
if not because either A, it is a powerful card

47:49.540 --> 47:51.540
that they wish to use in playing the game.

47:51.540 --> 47:51.860
Yeah.

47:51.860 --> 47:54.340
Or B, they know it is worth money.

47:55.220 --> 47:57.220
Those are the only two reasons.

47:57.220 --> 47:59.700
The only third is some kind of art project

47:59.700 --> 48:05.460
that specifically means that Zapdos-esque flair to it.

48:05.460 --> 48:07.860
Well, and boy, jokes has been out of the room

48:07.860 --> 48:08.660
for such a long time.

48:08.660 --> 48:10.020
I'm starting to miss them.

48:10.020 --> 48:12.340
But like it could also be a collection thing,

48:12.340 --> 48:14.420
like where they just need a holographic Zapdos.

48:14.420 --> 48:16.820
I mean, it's also kind of a cool looking card, isn't it?

48:16.820 --> 48:18.900
Look at this big bird, this big scary bird

48:18.900 --> 48:21.620
with a holographic background behind it.

48:21.620 --> 48:23.540
It's a powerful object.

48:23.540 --> 48:25.220
Like sometimes you just want,

48:25.220 --> 48:27.140
you know how people are like really into crystals

48:27.140 --> 48:29.060
because of the power that resides inside of them?

48:29.060 --> 48:30.100
That's kind of what's going on

48:30.100 --> 48:31.620
with this holographic Zapdos card.

48:32.660 --> 48:32.980
Okay.

48:32.980 --> 48:37.220
Okay, what do you owe this person?

48:38.020 --> 48:41.860
Assuming it's monetary, what do you owe this person?

48:41.860 --> 48:43.060
Because it seems weird.

48:43.700 --> 48:47.300
We have to, there's no fucking way it's monetary.

48:47.300 --> 48:48.820
For them to email you and say,

48:48.820 --> 48:49.700
do you have Pokemon cards?

48:49.700 --> 48:51.140
Do you have a holographic Zapdos?

48:51.140 --> 48:51.860
I need that.

48:51.860 --> 48:54.740
That's a wild way to get 85 bucks off your friend, huh?

48:54.740 --> 48:58.420
It is wild, but they did say holographic, didn't they?

48:59.380 --> 49:00.340
That's not for play.

49:00.340 --> 49:00.980
You could play.

49:00.980 --> 49:02.660
You could play a non-holographic Zapdos.

49:02.660 --> 49:03.620
Damn it, Justin, you're right.

49:03.620 --> 49:06.500
This also means, Griffin, if it's for a collection,

49:06.500 --> 49:08.340
they've looked it up and said,

49:08.340 --> 49:10.020
mm, $85, no thank you.

49:10.020 --> 49:11.220
I'll just see if they have one.

49:11.220 --> 49:13.460
Just con my idiot friend Jeremy.

49:13.460 --> 49:13.960
Yes.

49:14.980 --> 49:16.980
They know exactly what they're doing, Griffin.

49:17.540 --> 49:19.780
They're trying to catch them all.

49:19.780 --> 49:21.620
And by um, I mean you.

49:21.620 --> 49:23.620
And by all, I mean in a trap.

49:23.620 --> 49:27.220
I'm also pretty sure that Zapdos isn't allowed

49:27.220 --> 49:28.340
in like league play.

49:28.340 --> 49:29.220
It's legendary.

49:29.220 --> 49:31.380
Okay, let's bring jokes back in the room.

49:31.380 --> 49:32.900
Hey, jokes, thanks for coming.

49:32.900 --> 49:33.860
I'm afraid of Griffin.

49:33.860 --> 49:34.740
Fart, fart, fart.

49:36.660 --> 49:38.580
What would smell like if Zapdos farted?

49:40.100 --> 49:41.460
A one man play.

49:41.460 --> 49:44.180
Sorry, Griffin, coming to Broadway.

49:44.180 --> 49:46.660
Yeah, what if you had sex with Zapdos and it was pregnant?

49:46.660 --> 49:48.980
Do you guys feel better now that the jokes are back?

49:48.980 --> 49:49.940
A little bit, actually.

49:49.940 --> 49:51.300
That is actually very good.

49:51.300 --> 49:53.460
I think you have to ask them.

49:54.180 --> 49:55.620
Nope, sorry.

49:55.620 --> 49:57.540
You agreed to it.

49:57.540 --> 50:00.580
You were so excited about someone being interested

50:00.580 --> 50:02.580
in the collection that you just agreed to it.

50:02.580 --> 50:03.860
I think you gotta live with that.

50:04.500 --> 50:06.100
Yeah, yeah.

50:07.300 --> 50:09.380
Damn it, I wish I still had my fucking Pokemon cards.

50:09.380 --> 50:11.540
Damn it, I wish I was playing any kind of TCG right now.

50:11.540 --> 50:12.820
Boys, you gotta stop me.

50:12.820 --> 50:14.980
I'm an adult with more money than I had when I was a teen.

50:14.980 --> 50:17.300
I could buy a bunch of TCG shit right now.

50:17.300 --> 50:19.220
What happened to all your Pokemon cards, Griffin?

50:19.220 --> 50:20.420
I did sell them.

50:21.060 --> 50:22.100
I did all right.

50:22.100 --> 50:23.620
Made a little scratch.

50:23.620 --> 50:24.980
Do you think you would have made more money now

50:24.980 --> 50:25.860
if you had just waited?

50:25.860 --> 50:27.460
Uh, yeah, pal.

50:28.340 --> 50:29.700
Does that bother you?

50:29.700 --> 50:31.780
Let's spend, actually, let's spend the rest of this podcast

50:31.780 --> 50:33.620
just me looking up cards that I definitely did.

50:33.620 --> 50:35.940
Oh, holographic Blastoise, that's 175 bucks.

50:35.940 --> 50:38.420
That's about what I made for my entire collection.

50:38.420 --> 50:40.020
So that one hurts.

50:40.020 --> 50:42.580
What about the promotional Mewtwo

50:42.580 --> 50:44.900
from the movie that got released?

50:44.900 --> 50:47.780
Here it is for $249.

50:47.780 --> 50:50.180
So that one really shrinks the old nuts.

50:53.940 --> 50:55.540
All right, I can't fucking do this anymore.

50:55.540 --> 50:56.820
Griffin, you need the distraction.

50:56.820 --> 50:57.460
Yeah, sure.

50:59.300 --> 51:00.420
This one was sent in by Nick G.

51:00.420 --> 51:00.980
Thank you, Nick.

51:00.980 --> 51:01.620
It's a Yahoo!

51:01.620 --> 51:03.060
Answers user anonymous.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.820
What's weird is that it's an actual user

51:04.820 --> 51:07.700
who has made their name literally anonymous,

51:07.700 --> 51:09.940
which is a strange way of going about it.

51:10.740 --> 51:15.300
And it's, is this Radio Disney song about sex?

51:16.660 --> 51:18.340
Heard this song on Radio Disney the other day

51:18.340 --> 51:20.260
while my little sister was listening to it in the car.

51:20.260 --> 51:21.300
Started listening to the lyrics

51:21.300 --> 51:24.100
and there seems to be a ton of sexual references in them.

51:24.100 --> 51:26.340
Show me yours and I'll show you mine.

51:26.340 --> 51:28.260
You be the lock and I'll be the key.

51:28.260 --> 51:31.140
W-T-H, what do you, W-T-H?

51:31.140 --> 51:32.100
What the hell?

51:32.100 --> 51:34.580
Why is this on, why is this on Radio Disney?

51:34.580 --> 51:35.220
What do you think?

51:35.220 --> 51:36.900
Am I interpreting the lyrics wrong?

51:36.900 --> 51:39.780
The song is Midnight Romeo

51:39.780 --> 51:43.220
by a band or artist named Push Play.

51:43.220 --> 51:46.020
This was on Radio Disney where Goofy lives?

51:47.780 --> 51:48.580
Where Goofy lives?

51:48.580 --> 51:50.020
Goofy is trapped inside Radio Disney.

51:50.820 --> 51:52.420
So some of the lyrics include,

51:52.420 --> 51:54.180
my lips touch your lips.

51:54.180 --> 51:56.500
My hands is on your hips.

51:56.500 --> 51:58.980
What's it gonna take for you to give me my goodnight kiss?

51:59.700 --> 52:01.140
Man, they went for that, huh?

52:01.140 --> 52:02.100
Instead of the lyric,

52:02.100 --> 52:04.900
you'll be screaming for more and more and more of me.

52:05.620 --> 52:06.980
Yeah, so that's in there too.

52:06.980 --> 52:07.460
They turned it off in the house.

52:07.460 --> 52:10.660
Where Goofy lives with his friend Donald?

52:10.660 --> 52:11.940
In my home?

52:11.940 --> 52:16.020
We're singing this next to Mickey Mouse who's 90 years old.

52:16.020 --> 52:17.780
His fucking heart can't take Midnight Romeo.

52:17.780 --> 52:19.380
Gonna make you sweat.

52:19.380 --> 52:22.500
Gonna feel it head to toe.

52:22.500 --> 52:24.340
The orgasm.

52:24.340 --> 52:26.180
Right after that line though, it says,

52:26.180 --> 52:28.660
I'll be your Dr. Jekyll, your Mr. Hyde.

52:28.660 --> 52:30.340
Which makes me think that Push Play

52:30.340 --> 52:32.820
might have a fundamental misunderstanding

52:32.820 --> 52:34.980
of the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

52:34.980 --> 52:36.340
Horror of six.

52:41.060 --> 52:42.260
This is a good song.

52:44.740 --> 52:45.860
There's also a line here,

52:45.860 --> 52:47.540
tonight's about to win.

52:48.180 --> 52:48.740
What's that mean?

52:48.740 --> 52:49.540
What's that mean?

52:49.540 --> 52:51.380
Hey, are you sure you got that right?

52:51.380 --> 52:53.380
You guys don't say that right before you make coitus?

52:54.420 --> 52:55.780
Tonight's gonna win.

52:55.780 --> 52:58.580
Tonight's gonna be so, it's gonna be epic.

52:58.580 --> 53:00.900
I say that as I'm stretching, preparing my body.

53:00.900 --> 53:02.740
It's gonna be, it's about to be epic.

53:03.380 --> 53:04.260
I'm just saying,

53:04.820 --> 53:06.260
Uncle Scrooge is gonna have to have a talk

53:06.260 --> 53:07.300
with Huey, Dewey and Louie

53:07.300 --> 53:08.740
who live inside of Radio Disney

53:08.740 --> 53:10.420
because this song is their new neighbor.

53:11.060 --> 53:13.700
And it's talking about, you know, sweat.

53:13.700 --> 53:18.420
I do believe, even if there were no other references,

53:18.420 --> 53:21.620
something about the word sweat in a song of like,

53:21.620 --> 53:23.780
I don't know how to explain this to my kids.

53:23.780 --> 53:26.340
It's never been used in a non-erotic sense

53:26.340 --> 53:27.460
when speaking about music.

53:27.460 --> 53:29.380
If you're even gonna make you sweat,

53:29.380 --> 53:30.820
that could be referring to dancing

53:30.820 --> 53:32.100
or perhaps working out.

53:32.100 --> 53:34.260
It could also be, you know,

53:34.260 --> 53:36.260
a reference to working out that boner.

53:37.060 --> 53:38.340
Maybe we go through line by line

53:38.340 --> 53:40.020
and see if we can make it sort of,

53:40.820 --> 53:42.900
we can interpret it in a Disney way.

53:42.900 --> 53:44.020
In a Disney way.

53:44.020 --> 53:44.520
Okay.

53:45.620 --> 53:47.460
So, meet me at my door.

53:48.020 --> 53:49.300
I'm also looking at the lyrics.

53:49.860 --> 53:51.780
By the end, meet me by my door

53:51.780 --> 53:52.900
at the, by the end of the night.

53:52.900 --> 53:53.380
That's okay.

53:53.380 --> 53:55.940
That could be something you say to a UPS driver.

53:55.940 --> 53:56.900
I have a pizza for you.

53:57.540 --> 54:00.180
You'll be screaming for more and more and more of.

54:00.180 --> 54:02.260
Already we've hit a considerable roadblock.

54:02.260 --> 54:03.860
This is a pretty big bump.

54:03.860 --> 54:04.660
That's challenging.

54:06.980 --> 54:08.180
I also want to say though,

54:08.180 --> 54:08.900
the next line is,

54:08.900 --> 54:11.380
tonight's a big night, so let's make history.

54:11.380 --> 54:11.620
Okay.

54:11.620 --> 54:14.580
Which must imply that the sex is going to be so good.

54:14.580 --> 54:17.380
People will write about it for years to come.

54:17.380 --> 54:18.500
The year of our Lord.

54:20.020 --> 54:22.500
So, what if they finally figured out sex?

54:22.500 --> 54:24.500
Let's take this first stanza

54:24.500 --> 54:26.820
and we'll say that it is actually

54:26.820 --> 54:28.420
about a pizza being delivered

54:28.420 --> 54:29.540
and it is sung from the,

54:30.500 --> 54:32.420
from the perspective of the pizza.

54:32.420 --> 54:33.140
Okay.

54:33.140 --> 54:35.460
You'll be screaming for more and more and more of me.

54:35.460 --> 54:36.820
More pizza, please.

54:36.820 --> 54:39.220
That goes with my lips touch your lips.

54:39.220 --> 54:41.220
It'll be like, oh, your lips touch my pizza lips.

54:41.220 --> 54:42.740
I guess I'm not falsifying.

54:42.740 --> 54:44.260
That's what pepperonis is.

54:44.260 --> 54:45.460
Pepperonis is pizza lips.

54:45.460 --> 54:47.620
Now, my hand is on your hips.

54:47.620 --> 54:48.900
Now that could just be,

54:48.900 --> 54:50.980
my pizza hands are kind of on your,

54:50.980 --> 54:52.020
like a moment on the lips,

54:52.020 --> 54:53.300
a lifetime on the hips.

54:53.300 --> 54:54.420
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

54:54.420 --> 54:56.820
You're putting on the LBs from eating so much za.

54:57.700 --> 54:59.860
What's it gonna take for you to give me my goodnight kiss?

54:59.860 --> 55:01.300
Like, late night snack.

55:01.300 --> 55:02.020
I thought you were done.

55:02.020 --> 55:03.940
It came back for more za, perfect.

55:04.580 --> 55:05.460
Oh, whoa.

55:05.460 --> 55:06.580
Have you guys ever left?

55:06.580 --> 55:08.100
I've done this so many times recently.

55:08.100 --> 55:09.140
I hate to admit it.

55:09.140 --> 55:12.180
Have you guys ever left a pizza out all night

55:12.180 --> 55:12.980
in self-defense?

55:13.700 --> 55:15.060
I've gotten in the habit of like,

55:15.940 --> 55:16.900
I gotta let it rot.

55:16.900 --> 55:17.860
I can't put it away.

55:17.860 --> 55:19.620
You gotta let it, you gotta.

55:19.620 --> 55:21.700
Now, this fits our pizza theme.

55:21.700 --> 55:22.260
It's so good.

55:22.260 --> 55:23.780
The next line is, oh, whoa.

55:23.780 --> 55:26.260
My heart is being fast, but my hands are moving slow.

55:26.260 --> 55:28.020
I think this person's having a heart attack.

55:29.220 --> 55:30.820
They ate too much pizza.

55:30.820 --> 55:31.620
Yeah, sure.

55:31.620 --> 55:33.060
Now their heart is being fast

55:33.060 --> 55:34.420
and like their hand,

55:34.420 --> 55:36.580
you know, they're having pain in their arm.

55:36.580 --> 55:38.420
Okay, so this one's tough.

55:38.420 --> 55:40.340
Late night, gonna hit the town,

55:40.340 --> 55:41.780
gonna take you out, gonna make you go, whoa, whoa.

55:41.780 --> 55:44.900
You would not do this with, wouldn't do that with pizza.

55:44.900 --> 55:48.820
I can't, you could take your pizza out on the town,

55:48.820 --> 55:50.020
like, hey pizza, I'm gonna show you

55:50.020 --> 55:51.780
some of my favorite hotspots.

55:51.780 --> 55:53.220
I don't think pizza can be like,

55:53.220 --> 55:55.940
this one's on me, let's go, I'm driving.

55:55.940 --> 55:59.140
Is this a switch in perspective to the driver maybe?

55:59.860 --> 56:02.340
If that's the case, then it's gonna make you sweat.

56:02.340 --> 56:03.140
Here's the problem, boys.

56:03.140 --> 56:04.340
I'm looking three lines ahead.

56:04.340 --> 56:05.620
We got gonna make you sweat

56:05.620 --> 56:06.260
and it's gonna be tough though.

56:06.260 --> 56:07.780
We've got that and show me yours

56:07.780 --> 56:08.740
and I'll show you mine.

56:08.740 --> 56:09.700
And that's just hard.

56:09.700 --> 56:10.500
That's just tough.

56:10.500 --> 56:11.940
And I'll tell you, there's no reason.

56:11.940 --> 56:13.700
I've eaten so much pizza in my life.

56:13.700 --> 56:16.020
The next line is literally the title of the song,

56:16.020 --> 56:16.980
Midnight Romeo.

56:16.980 --> 56:18.420
I've never said anything even like close to that.

56:18.420 --> 56:19.620
That's the name of the pizza company.

56:19.620 --> 56:21.540
The pizza company is Midnight Romeo.

56:21.540 --> 56:23.940
Romeo's Pizza delivers very late

56:23.940 --> 56:24.900
and they want you to know

56:24.900 --> 56:26.660
you can get Romeos at midnight

56:26.660 --> 56:28.980
or a Midnight Romeo as they have called it here.

56:28.980 --> 56:29.780
If you will.

56:29.780 --> 56:31.060
Show me yours, I'll show you mine.

56:31.060 --> 56:31.940
That's easy.

56:31.940 --> 56:34.340
They've got a pizza exchange program where-

56:35.220 --> 56:37.460
Give me your old pizza, I'll give you this new one.

56:37.460 --> 56:37.960
Exactly.

56:38.660 --> 56:40.740
Alternatively, you know how every PG-13 movie

56:40.740 --> 56:42.100
you can say fucking at once?

56:42.100 --> 56:44.580
Maybe this one line is referring to genitals.

56:44.580 --> 56:46.820
Now we do get to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

56:46.820 --> 56:47.220
Do they work?

56:47.220 --> 56:49.540
I wanna hear it gonna make you sweat,

56:49.540 --> 56:50.580
gonna feel it from head to toe.

56:51.540 --> 56:54.260
That's jalapeno on the pizza.

56:54.260 --> 56:55.460
It's very spicy and you're like,

56:55.460 --> 56:57.460
ooh, I can feel this through my whole body.

56:57.460 --> 56:58.260
It's so zesty.

56:58.980 --> 57:01.060
Oh, and it says here a little later in the song,

57:01.060 --> 57:02.420
tonight your dinner's free.

57:03.060 --> 57:05.700
So like, they probably got there after 30 minutes.

57:05.700 --> 57:08.900
Let me just say problematic Push Play lyrics.

57:08.900 --> 57:10.180
Tonight your dinner's free.

57:10.180 --> 57:11.140
What's in it for me?

57:11.860 --> 57:13.620
No, sometimes you just buy the pizza

57:13.620 --> 57:15.220
because you wanna buy the pizza for someone.

57:15.220 --> 57:16.340
Yeah, hey, Goofy's in there.

57:16.340 --> 57:18.100
So watch what you're doing there, Push Play.

57:18.740 --> 57:23.300
I played my little one, my four-year-old.

57:23.860 --> 57:26.980
We were talking to her about Kesha and who Kesha is.

57:26.980 --> 57:30.900
I think she came up because your wife Teresa

57:30.900 --> 57:33.220
had discussed Kesha with her on tour.

57:33.220 --> 57:36.900
And I wanted to play a song of hers to familiarize her

57:36.900 --> 57:38.100
with this concept.

57:38.100 --> 57:40.820
So I picked TikTok, the concept of Kesha,

57:40.820 --> 57:42.340
the very idea of Kesha.

57:42.340 --> 57:45.300
And I picked TikTok because it slaps.

57:45.300 --> 57:48.740
But I noticed that luckily there's a Kidz Bop version of it

57:49.540 --> 57:52.180
because some of the lyrics are challenging

57:52.180 --> 57:52.980
for a four-year-old.

57:53.780 --> 57:56.100
I just wanna hit you guys with it.

57:56.100 --> 57:57.940
Yeah, what does she brush her teeth with?

57:57.940 --> 58:00.660
Okay, so grab my glasses.

58:00.660 --> 58:01.380
I'm out the door.

58:01.380 --> 58:02.580
I'm gonna hit this city.

58:02.580 --> 58:05.460
Before I leave, brush my teeth, and then I go and pack.

58:07.060 --> 58:09.380
Because when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back.

58:09.380 --> 58:11.620
Well, that's very responsible.

58:11.620 --> 58:13.860
You're gonna go maybe spend the night at a friend's house.

58:13.860 --> 58:14.740
Spend the night at a friend's house.

58:14.740 --> 58:18.900
And then later we got drop topping, playing our favorite CDs,

58:18.900 --> 58:23.540
pulling up to the parties, trying to get a little bit silly,

58:23.540 --> 58:26.500
which actually sounds more like drug use than tipsy.

58:28.340 --> 58:30.820
Tipsy sounds like I'm gonna have one drink too many

58:30.820 --> 58:33.540
because I've earned it, I've had a hard day at work.

58:33.540 --> 58:35.060
I'm going to have one drink too many

58:35.060 --> 58:37.220
and then wait and sober up before I head home.

58:37.220 --> 58:42.500
So here's a weird change I didn't see coming.

58:42.500 --> 58:44.180
Don't stop, make it pop.

58:44.180 --> 58:46.100
DJ, blow my speakers up.

58:46.100 --> 58:49.620
Tonight, I'm all right till we see the sunlight.

58:49.620 --> 58:52.100
So that's, again, perhaps-

58:52.100 --> 58:53.300
Not I'm gonna fight?

58:53.300 --> 58:54.900
No, they're all right.

58:54.900 --> 58:57.540
Like, this is more disturbing, Kidz Bop.

58:57.540 --> 59:00.900
This is someone who is only okay when it's nighttime

59:00.900 --> 59:02.660
and they're in a darkened club.

59:02.660 --> 59:05.540
And then when they see the sun come up at five in the morning,

59:05.540 --> 59:08.260
they're like, well, time to get back to my terrible kids,

59:08.260 --> 59:09.620
I guess, I hate this.

59:10.180 --> 59:14.180
And then the best part of TikTok, the Kidz Bop version,

59:14.180 --> 59:18.500
is that's all the words in the entire song

59:18.500 --> 59:20.900
because they can't make any of the rest.

59:20.900 --> 59:22.820
The rest of the song is unsalvageable.

59:22.820 --> 59:25.540
So I hand to God for 90 seconds,

59:25.540 --> 59:29.540
they do the chorus five times and that's it.

59:29.540 --> 59:31.780
That's it, they can't do anything.

59:31.780 --> 59:33.060
They can't like get like,

59:33.060 --> 59:35.140
boys wanna touch our junk and all that stuff.

59:35.140 --> 59:36.740
Nope, can't figure it out.

59:36.740 --> 59:38.420
Can't figure it out, can't do it.

59:38.420 --> 59:40.820
Just gonna do the chorus five times, Kidz Bop.

59:40.820 --> 59:43.300
The Kidz Bop version of Sleazy is just an instrumental.

59:44.180 --> 59:47.140
Thank you all so much for listening to our program.

59:47.140 --> 59:48.180
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

59:48.900 --> 59:52.500
Again, our new website and YouTube channel is McElroy Family.

59:52.500 --> 59:55.780
If you are subscribed to MBMBAM on YouTube,

59:55.780 --> 59:58.660
one, sorry about the years long neglect of that.

59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.020
Thank you for your patronage.

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.500
But it has been resurrected as McElroy Family.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.660
So you're already subscribed, but it's worth it to go check.

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:08.660
And McElroy.family is the website.

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:11.380

there's a Twitter account too, at McElroy Family.

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:16.740
Honestly don't know, might just be a good catch all feed.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.500
We don't exactly know what we're gonna do with that yet.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.980
But if you could go subscribe to that channel

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.820
and bookmark that page, we'd sure appreciate it.

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.820
We're really happy with it and we think it came out real neat.

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.060
And that's gonna be for the future,

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:32.340
like where we're gonna have the McElroy mail,

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:34.900
our mailing list that you can get stuff through.

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:38.820
And also the website is gonna be where all tour information

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:39.780

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.940

The fucking December pin of the month is so fucking great.

01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.740
It is real great.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:00.260
There's ornaments on there too.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.420
There's some good stuff that you wanna get

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:03.780
all your family and friends.

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:06.500
And you know that coworker that you drew their name

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.860
for the Secret Santa gift exchange.

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.500
You're like, I literally know nothing about them.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.260
Get them some of our McElroy Merch.

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:14.340
It's as good as anything else you would get them.

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:16.020
Fair, the December pin of the month

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:20.420
is my job application electronic sign

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:21.620
that says, you know, on it.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.820
It's so fucking choice.

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:23.540
It's really good.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.300
Anything else?

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.340
Start setting in your Candle Nights questions.

01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:29.780
Yeah, yes, please.

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.500
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:33.300
for the use of our theme song,

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.220
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:38.900
It's a fantastic album, fantastic dude.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:41.460
And hey, good holidays gift, I bet.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.940
I also wanna thank Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.740
Definitely wanna shout out that the JV Club

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:49.540
with Janet Varney has joined the network very recently.

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:52.020
So if you've sampled the other shows on the network,

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.900
go give that one a try because it's fantastic

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:57.380
and much better than any of the shows that we make.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:00.500
So that's something that we're gonna have to struggle with.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.380
Do you guys want the final?

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:03.300
Yes, yeah.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.220

Thank you, it's Yahoo Answers user Al The Pal,

who I'm almost certain I've gotten

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.820
the last question out of before.

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:16.980
Al The Pal asks, I know cows have udders,

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:22.100
but do they also have breasts?

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.940
My name is Justin McElroy.
