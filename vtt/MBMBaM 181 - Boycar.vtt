00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:48.240
Hello, and welcome to my brother and my brother made an advice show for the modern era. I'm

00:48.240 --> 00:51.680
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.680 --> 00:56.160
I'm your baby-est baby, Griffin McElroy. A lot of times people ask us, how do you

00:56.160 --> 01:01.920
guys record the show? How do you capture the magic? How do you capture it? It seems like

01:01.920 --> 01:08.080
you're in the same room, and I have to convince them, but no, in fact, we are in separate rooms.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.480
Separate states?

01:10.480 --> 01:12.560
Separate states, separate time zones.

01:13.680 --> 01:18.000
Separate, like, states of mind and general levels of professionalism,

01:18.000 --> 01:20.400
I guess is fair to say. Preparedness.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.520
Say professionalism.

01:21.520 --> 01:22.640
Yeah, I think that's probably-

01:22.640 --> 01:27.120
Listen, some of us got waylaid on the way to recording because they stopped to be a

01:27.120 --> 01:31.120
Good Samaritan because a woman's car died and they pushed it single-handedly into a

01:31.120 --> 01:31.520
parking lot.

01:31.520 --> 01:34.080
Now, let me tell you something, Travis, because you told that story,

01:34.080 --> 01:36.160
but you also said that you straight up forgot.

01:36.160 --> 01:39.360
Oh no, also that too. It's not like I was on my way home to record.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.680
I was just on my way home to nap.

01:41.680 --> 01:42.640
You definitely forgot.

01:42.640 --> 01:43.120
You definitely-

01:43.120 --> 01:44.000
For sure forgot.

01:44.000 --> 01:44.960
Definitely forgot.

01:44.960 --> 01:48.560
But then I turned on my computer and it worked perfectly right away.

01:48.560 --> 01:52.720
Yeah. Justin's downloaded far too much World of Warcraft porn

01:52.720 --> 01:54.400
that he found on an internet website.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.280
Like, DigiPorn of World of Warcraft characters, and now-

01:57.280 --> 01:59.920
Yeah, you can put anything into Google.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.840
For a long time, I thought there were more rules.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.280
But you can type whatever in and it'll deliver.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.120
You can pretty much type whatever you want in there.

02:05.760 --> 02:06.240
My thing was-

02:06.240 --> 02:10.880
My computer has been waylaid by the fine folks at Comcast.

02:12.160 --> 02:17.920
They tried to convince me today that below one megabyte of downloadable speed

02:17.920 --> 02:20.560
is not bad, not too bad.

02:22.560 --> 02:27.520
My thing, my story is that I was here on time with a computer that worked perfectly.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.080
So I guess it's not as fun or relevant.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.640
But, driven, you also have all those dark spots on your soul.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.640
I do have those, but those don't really-

02:34.640 --> 02:38.640
I guess they come through in some form in the recording sesh,

02:38.640 --> 02:42.480
but otherwise I am fucking Stevie Wonder in here

02:42.480 --> 02:45.360
in terms of professionalism and preparedness.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.360
That's my secret to a good podcast.

02:47.360 --> 02:50.880
You know nothing about Stevie Wonder's professionalism.

02:50.880 --> 02:56.480
As long as 33, 33.3% repeating of the podcast performers

02:57.200 --> 03:01.280
have that Stevie Wonder level of professionalism and preparedness,

03:01.280 --> 03:02.240
you're in for a good epit.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.440
Yeah, that's all it takes.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.200
We can be a third on our game and still-

03:07.920 --> 03:12.160
Hey guys, I got two shoulders to carry both of you over.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.440
One for each shoulder.

03:13.440 --> 03:14.480
Brother, my brother and me.

03:14.480 --> 03:18.560
One working computer and two working shoulders.

03:18.560 --> 03:19.920
It's the show of the year here.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.240
Travis's computer works, Travis's computer works,

03:22.240 --> 03:26.960
but the fucking scheduler app on his iPhone does not, apparently,

03:26.960 --> 03:28.720
or his watch, which was it, Trav?

03:28.720 --> 03:29.360
Your watch, your crap.

03:29.360 --> 03:31.200
I don't own a watch, Griffin.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.720
Boom, shakalaka.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.240
Okay, you took him downtown.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.200
Anyway, we're not here to complain about us.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.320
We're here to complain about you.

03:38.320 --> 03:38.880
About you.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.280
Can I be here to complain about us?

03:42.160 --> 03:43.360
Yeah, I mean, you can complain,

03:43.360 --> 03:46.400
but let's make it a post-show sort of situation.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.800
I got a lot of things on the docket.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.560
We'll talk about it in couples counseling.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.600
Okay, triples.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.480
Triples counseling.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.280
Here's our first question.

03:55.280 --> 03:59.360
Is it okay to walk up to a drive-through window to order my food?

03:59.360 --> 04:02.080
I don't have a car, but I'm often walking around town

04:02.080 --> 04:04.080
where many drive-through chains are located.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.640
Would it be weird if I were to use the drive-through windows on foot

04:06.640 --> 04:08.320
or maybe on a bike or something?

04:08.320 --> 04:12.160
In our town, the lines are usually longer than the lines at the window,

04:12.160 --> 04:14.880
and I don't want to have to go through all the trouble

04:14.880 --> 04:16.240
of buying food inside the restaurant

04:16.240 --> 04:17.920
when I'm leaving immediately afterwards.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.120
Am I being weird?

04:19.120 --> 04:21.040
That's from walking in Wisconsin.

04:22.400 --> 04:26.640
Listen, I don't want to poke a hole in this,

04:26.640 --> 04:27.680
but it won't work.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.960
Yeah, a lot of places won't serve you.

04:30.960 --> 04:34.720
No, no, I mean, like, physically, physics-wise,

04:35.200 --> 04:37.360
there's a weight sensor that alerts them

04:37.360 --> 04:38.960
that there's a car there

04:38.960 --> 04:41.040
that you're just not going to be able to trigger.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.520
This person's super fucking fat, you don't know.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.800
Okay, I didn't think of that.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.440
They love fast food, but they also love walking,

04:47.440 --> 04:48.000
so I don't know.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.120
Maybe just carry some barbells with you

04:51.120 --> 04:53.680
and just fucking slam it Thor-style on the ground.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.080
That would also help you burn off the hardies.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.320
I don't think that's a way to entreat service.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.480
I don't think slamming barbells.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.920
Bring me burgers!

05:04.560 --> 05:06.720
I don't think that you're going to be...

05:06.720 --> 05:08.560
If you went with a group of friends

05:08.560 --> 05:10.720
and you all pretended you were an invisible car,

05:10.720 --> 05:12.240
they'd probably feel bad enough

05:12.240 --> 05:13.600
for you to throw you some chicken nubs.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.160
Yeah, like a mime car.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.480
You could be like a post-modern art car.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.920
Okay, but mine car's not going to set off

05:19.920 --> 05:21.360
the weight thing, is it?

05:21.360 --> 05:23.200
Well, if you all stand on each other's shoulders

05:23.200 --> 05:24.560
and jump up and down real quick.

05:24.560 --> 05:25.600
Yeah, like you're in a car.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.960
What are you talking about?

05:26.960 --> 05:28.480
Well, I mean, you just got to concentrate

05:28.480 --> 05:29.760
the weight into one spot.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.440
I think the question, are you being weird?

05:32.000 --> 05:32.480
Yes.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.600
Yes, but does that mean it's bad?

05:35.600 --> 05:36.480
That's for cars.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.320
Try to imagine this in your head.

05:40.320 --> 05:42.160
You've walked through this little scenario,

05:42.160 --> 05:44.000
but I don't think you fully considered the part

05:44.000 --> 05:47.440
where you're in line with other cars as a person.

05:47.440 --> 05:50.480
Like slowly walking up as the line scoots forward

05:50.480 --> 05:53.120
and you're standing there like you're a car.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.560
What's important is that you have to do that thing

05:54.560 --> 05:56.320
where it looks like you're sitting down in the seat

05:56.320 --> 05:57.840
with your hand on the steering wheel.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.440
And then when somebody pulls up too close to you,

05:59.440 --> 06:02.240
you got to spin around and start yelling at them silently

06:02.240 --> 06:03.600
and like waving your hand at them.

06:04.560 --> 06:05.520
And it's probably important.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.040
It's probably good to say like,

06:07.040 --> 06:08.960
puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.160
And kind of bounce a little bit.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.680
So they know the car is still running.

06:11.680 --> 06:15.200
Won't the illusion be like cast off though

06:15.200 --> 06:16.480
once the person behind you

06:16.480 --> 06:18.560
inevitably tries to run over you?

06:18.560 --> 06:19.600
No, you're in a smart car.

06:20.720 --> 06:21.360
I guess like-

06:21.360 --> 06:22.320
They're very tiny.

06:22.320 --> 06:22.960
They're very tiny.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.080
Can you go through a drive-through?

06:24.080 --> 06:25.280
They're very tiny.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.800
Can you go through a drive-through on a Segway?

06:28.320 --> 06:29.840
What if you went through on a bicycle

06:29.840 --> 06:32.320
in which you built a cardboard car around

06:32.320 --> 06:34.160
and no one can tell the difference?

06:34.160 --> 06:35.760
If the concern is being weird,

06:35.760 --> 06:38.480
I think you've firmly veered into that territory.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.120
Go on one of those bikes and stacked on top of another bike.

06:42.080 --> 06:42.960
That's not a thing.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.920
Oh, yes it is, Justin.

06:45.920 --> 06:48.240
Someone's welded a bike frame on top of a bike frame

06:48.240 --> 06:50.080
and it's like two bikes frames tall.

06:50.080 --> 06:50.720
That's a thing.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.920
Another solution is you go to the Taco Bell

06:53.920 --> 06:55.280
and you get some spicy sauce.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.320
Drain that in your mouth

06:56.320 --> 06:57.680
and then you'll turn into a hot rod

06:57.680 --> 06:58.640
like that one cartoon.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.120
Are you talking about Turbo Teen?

07:03.840 --> 07:04.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.080
It's been like 140 episodes

07:06.080 --> 07:08.560
since our last Turbo Teen reference.

07:08.560 --> 07:09.840
Welcome back, Turbo Teen.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.080
It's a Candle Nights miracle.

07:12.080 --> 07:12.720
That's a franchise.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.560
Talking about Turbo Teen again.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.480
That is a franchise that is just itching

07:16.480 --> 07:18.720
and raring and roaring for a reboot.

07:18.720 --> 07:19.760
Gotta get a Turbo Teen.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.040
Shia LaBeouf cast him in that.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.640
That's what I'm saying.

07:22.640 --> 07:26.880
He's obviously shown his prowess at being in movies

07:26.880 --> 07:29.520
where cars turn into other shit and vice versa.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.640
So you think you want to see Shia LaBeouf?

07:32.640 --> 07:34.160
I don't want to pigeonhole LaBeouf,

07:34.160 --> 07:38.400
but I think that in the light of recent controversy,

07:39.840 --> 07:42.240
we should try and get the kid back in the picture.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.320
He wants to get into a family-friendly picture

07:46.320 --> 07:48.240
like Turbo Teen 2000.

07:48.240 --> 07:51.760
But here's the thing, Shia, tips from us to you.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.320
You need to make sure to call that thing Turbo Teen

07:54.320 --> 07:57.600
and you need to make sure to license the Turbo Teen license

07:57.600 --> 07:58.880
from whoever does own that.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.440
Don't just write a movie called Boy Car

08:01.440 --> 08:04.240
about a boy that eats hot sauce and turns into cars.

08:04.240 --> 08:07.360
Yo, I'm back with another Shia LaBeouf ridge.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.680
It's called Boy Car.

08:10.880 --> 08:14.000
It's called Vroom Boy.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.480
Apparently Shia LaBeouf,

08:16.480 --> 08:18.240
whenever he did get into this hot water,

08:18.240 --> 08:19.680
and by the way, I love Shia LaBeouf.

08:19.680 --> 08:22.560
I don't, I think he's great, whatever he's doing.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.400
Even Stevens, Transformers,

08:24.400 --> 08:27.520
that one Sigur Ros music video where he got his dick out.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.640
I'm a big fan of all of those things.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.760
Do you think when that stuff broke bad with Shia,

08:33.760 --> 08:36.080
fellow Even Stevens star, Beans,

08:36.080 --> 08:38.000
thought maybe it was time for Beans to send in,

08:38.720 --> 08:41.200
time for Beans to make his play at the big show?

08:42.400 --> 08:45.200
Travis, if you don't stop sending us fucking pictures

08:45.200 --> 08:46.400
of giant bicycles, I'm quitting the show.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.640
It's Bike on Top of Bikes on Top of Bikes.

08:48.640 --> 08:49.200
Yeah.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.280
Travis, I'm quitting the show.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.320
You said it wasn't a thing.

08:52.320 --> 08:53.680
I'm gonna school you, son.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.320
Yeah, well, I love this school.

08:56.320 --> 09:00.960
Welcome to Travis McElroy's School for Audio Podcasts.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.160
Here's where listeners come to be educated

09:04.160 --> 09:05.120
about things they can't see.

09:06.880 --> 09:07.680
You guys know Yahoo?

09:09.120 --> 09:10.080
Por favor.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.600
Don't do this thing, by the way.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.680
Just go inside and wait in the line like an adult.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.400
I feel bad.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.440
Just go inside and wait in the line.

09:15.440 --> 09:18.800
Isn't it weird that we choose a rando celeb

09:18.800 --> 09:20.000
to beat up on every week,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.080
and I genuinely don't like that part of the show.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.640
I feel like of all the ones we've done, though,

09:24.640 --> 09:28.160
Shia LaBeouf, he's still got a lot of power behind him.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.240
I feel the worst about Shia LaBeouf, though,

09:30.240 --> 09:33.760
because he's already getting it from all sides,

09:33.760 --> 09:35.040
front, back, left, and right.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.440
We should pick someone who's on top who's a darling

09:37.440 --> 09:39.520
and be like, fuck you, Jennifer Lawrence.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.560
But here's the thing.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.240
Now you watch your mouth.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.320
She's America's sweetheart.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.160
I feel like with Shia, what's good about that

09:48.160 --> 09:51.120
is we didn't want to be timely with making fun of Shia,

09:51.120 --> 09:53.920
so we waited until the wound might conceivably

09:53.920 --> 09:55.280
have started to heal.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.560
And then we go back in.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.440
We start digging.

09:57.440 --> 09:58.880
Is this a fresh scab here?

09:58.880 --> 10:00.080
Let us just check this out.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.200
I feel kind of terrible, and I will for the rest of the episode.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.560
Shia, if you're listening, we're sorry.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.120
We left you an even deeper grave.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.200
This is why we can't build a celebrity fan base,

10:07.200 --> 10:08.640
because everybody's a friend of everybody.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.040
Yeah, because we've made fun of everybody at this point.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.720
Do you guys want to Yahoo this one?

10:12.720 --> 10:13.200
Yes, you do.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.400
This one is sent in by Jacob Harrison.

10:14.400 --> 10:14.960
Thanks, Jacob.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.960
It's by Yahoo answer chooser Chris, who asks,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.480
how can I write a review for a McDonald's employee?

10:21.920 --> 10:23.440
I went to my local McDonald's today

10:23.440 --> 10:24.880
and one of the employees really stood out

10:24.880 --> 10:25.760
from the rest of the team.

10:26.560 --> 10:27.760
He was extremely kind.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.360
And we actually had a conversation.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.360
His positive energy really brightened my day.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.720
I was hoping to tell his manager how good of an employee he is

10:34.720 --> 10:36.880
so that maybe he could get a raise or something,

10:36.880 --> 10:38.800
but I don't want to tell the manager in person.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.840
Does anyone know if there is like a writer review section

10:41.840 --> 10:42.960
on the McDonald's website?

10:42.960 --> 10:44.320
I prefer it to be anonymous.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.920
Also, would that be possible?

10:46.960 --> 10:49.360
Also, does anyone know if I can do this for Chipotle?

10:49.360 --> 10:53.040
He doesn't want to get bogged down in some sort of

10:53.040 --> 10:55.120
single white female situation

10:55.120 --> 10:56.880
where this employee becomes obsessed with him

10:56.880 --> 10:57.600
and his kindness.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.520
I laughed and I'm sorry I laughed because

11:02.240 --> 11:03.200
We've had this experience.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.400
Everybody's had this experience.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.280
The fact of the matter is like,

11:07.280 --> 11:10.560
dude working at McDonald's, fucking kudos.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.560
Awesome for you that you're going out of your way

11:12.560 --> 11:14.720
to make the dude coming into McDonald's have a good day

11:14.720 --> 11:15.840
and you're smiling and it's great.

11:15.840 --> 11:19.760
I laughed because what's your day like

11:20.560 --> 11:23.760
in which it was made because that guy at McDonald's

11:23.760 --> 11:24.880
really took the time.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.080
Who the fuck are you?

11:26.080 --> 11:30.400
No, you're telling me that when you have this experience,

11:30.400 --> 11:32.400
to me it is as bad as when you go to McDonald's

11:32.400 --> 11:35.040
and you have a really shitty experience with an employee

11:35.040 --> 11:38.560
and you know like, ah, there is no recourse for,

11:38.560 --> 11:41.200
there is no way that I can inform this person.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.880
No, I'm sorry, what world do you live in

11:42.880 --> 11:45.040
in which you do not walk out the doors in your life?

11:45.040 --> 11:47.040
Whoop, clean slate style.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.400
It was a brand new day.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.560
Like I can't remember the faces of people

11:50.560 --> 11:52.160
I've seen in the McDonald's.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.280
Well that's because you're a sociopath.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.120
The person that I am inside the McDonald's

11:55.120 --> 11:57.360
is not the person I was before or after.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.600
He's more full.

11:59.600 --> 12:03.360
If you meet a stranger, and that stranger,

12:03.360 --> 12:05.600
regardless of what the circumstance is,

12:05.600 --> 12:08.080
but especially if they have overcome the adversity

12:08.080 --> 12:11.360
of being like in McDonald's the whole day.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.120
Like we've talked about how horrible it is

12:13.120 --> 12:15.440
like crossing the threshold of a fast food restaurant.

12:15.440 --> 12:19.600
These people do this for 10 to 12 hours a day, right?

12:19.600 --> 12:20.960
If you meet somebody like that

12:20.960 --> 12:22.240
and you have a great convo with them

12:22.240 --> 12:24.160
who has overcome the adversity of McDonald's

12:24.160 --> 12:27.040
to have like a really great convo with you.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.040
Then it's just two ships passing.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.960
You move off into the night,

12:30.960 --> 12:32.960
they had a nice moment, you had a nice moment,

12:32.960 --> 12:35.840
and then you eat your McDouble in your silent peace.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.000
But this is why, Travis, people like you

12:38.000 --> 12:39.440
are why things never get better.

12:39.440 --> 12:40.000
Right.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.800
Because you don't get kudos for being nice

12:42.800 --> 12:44.000
and what's the point?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.280
No, because the other side of that

12:45.280 --> 12:47.920
is I also accept their right to be shitty to me

12:47.920 --> 12:50.000
because they're stuck in a McDonald's.

12:50.000 --> 12:50.880
This is the thing though.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.320
If we started expecting more

12:53.440 --> 12:54.960
from minimum wage employees,

12:54.960 --> 12:57.120
then we'd have to start demanding to pay them more.

12:57.120 --> 13:00.000
And then the whole rising tide and ships.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.200
There's a lot of nautical references going on right now.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.560
But listen, Travis,

13:04.560 --> 13:06.160
I don't think you're measuring your life in love.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.120
I don't think if you have this experience with a person.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.120
600 burgers.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.400
If you have this experience

13:14.400 --> 13:16.720
and you don't walk away from it talking to,

13:16.720 --> 13:18.800
you don't tell Teresa when you get home,

13:18.800 --> 13:21.840
oh, the McDonald's guy said something really nice

13:21.840 --> 13:23.040
about my jacket.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.000
Like, what are you fucking doing?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.480
No, because that requires me the other thousand times

13:26.480 --> 13:27.120
to come in and be like,

13:27.120 --> 13:29.440
they're really snotty to me at McDonald's again.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.240
Well, that's what I'm saying.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.720
I feel like judging from the experiences

13:32.720 --> 13:34.560
I've had with other McDonald's employees

13:34.560 --> 13:38.480
at our local, like my McDonald's, like my Mickey D's,

13:38.480 --> 13:42.640
if someone said, hey, this guy was really nice to me,

13:42.640 --> 13:45.600
you would probably be fired for messing up the curve.

13:45.600 --> 13:51.520
The people at my McDonald's are like openly hostile.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.840
Like they have embraced their situation.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.360
And this may surprise you,

13:55.360 --> 13:57.680
a lot of turnover at that McDonald's.

13:57.680 --> 13:58.960
And a lot of Apple turnovers.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.240
Turnovers, thank you.

14:00.240 --> 14:00.720
You guys suck.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.600
But here's the thing is like, that's their right.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.800
Like I figured that's the McDonald's tip.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.800
You know, I don't give you extra money.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.960
So yeah, you can be really snotty to me

14:11.600 --> 14:13.920
because I'm the one in there ordering the ranch.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.040
This is what I'm saying.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.720
But Travis, this is what I'm saying to you.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.480
And follow me here.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.520
Follow me with this.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.520
What we've accepted, what your rationale

14:21.520 --> 14:22.720
that you've accepted is,

14:22.720 --> 14:25.520
well, these are really terrible jobs.

14:25.520 --> 14:30.560
And so the people at them have a right to be hostile.

14:30.560 --> 14:33.120
And I can see there's a certain logic to that.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.400
I think that's fair.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.080
But what you're denying is the fact

14:36.080 --> 14:38.560
that what we've done is basically create a system

14:38.560 --> 14:42.400
where people are in jobs that are so bad

14:42.960 --> 14:45.280
that we have built for ourselves

14:45.280 --> 14:47.680
several unpleasant experiences

14:47.680 --> 14:49.760
that we are going to have every day.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.640
Imagine if we were like paying people decently

14:52.640 --> 14:54.320
and they actually were like really gave

14:54.960 --> 14:56.160
like copious shit about their job.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.440
Thank you, Joseph Stalin.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.000
I agree.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.440
We should pay everyone better.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.280
We should all be on an equal level.

15:01.280 --> 15:04.000
That's just not the way the world works, Daisy Mae.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.520
It sounds like Travis wants every restaurant to be Dick's last resort.

15:07.520 --> 15:10.160
It sounds like Travis just wants people to shovel shit.

15:10.160 --> 15:13.680
And what is shocking to me is that you get like angry

15:13.680 --> 15:16.560
when atop the pile of shit, the shit king,

15:16.560 --> 15:20.240
the person who survived like 147 hours style

15:20.240 --> 15:23.040
and has climbed through the shit to come up and say,

15:23.040 --> 15:25.520
Travis, hey, I really like your jacket.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.280
No, you're wrong.

15:27.280 --> 15:28.080
Here's why you're wrong.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.840
Because I think that's second day Darryl.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.600
He's been working there for maybe two weeks.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.760
It doesn't fucking matter how much money they make,

15:35.760 --> 15:36.640
how long they've been there.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.240
They said something nice about your jacket.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.520
The last thousand-

15:39.520 --> 15:43.040
When you compliment second day Darryl when he's at the top,

15:43.040 --> 15:45.600
it's just going to make him look worse when he's at the bottom.

15:46.400 --> 15:50.080
Darryl used to be so well connected with the other employees

15:50.080 --> 15:51.040
and with the customers.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.480
Everyone used to love your performance.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.720
And now you just glare at everybody.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.440
What's wrong?

15:56.160 --> 15:57.760
You got to measure your life and love, Travis.

15:57.760 --> 15:58.160
You're not measuring your life and love.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.560
Don't draw attention to second day Darryl.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.560
Save it at second day.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.240
I agree with Griffin on this one, Travis.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.920
I think you're not measuring life with love.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.680
I'd go out of my way to be friendly to everybody

16:09.680 --> 16:12.000
who is currently working a job when I encounter them

16:12.000 --> 16:14.080
because I feel like that can help buoy their spirits.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.840
And I think if enough people do that,

16:15.840 --> 16:18.000
then you get charged up with positive energy

16:18.000 --> 16:20.640
and you can start unloading that into people that come in.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.080
It's a whole cycle, Travis.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.280
What was that sound?

16:23.280 --> 16:24.240
Was that a cash register?

16:24.240 --> 16:27.200
Because Justin has paid that shit forward, I think.

16:27.200 --> 16:27.680
What's up?

16:27.680 --> 16:28.480
I didn't see the movie.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.120
You don't have a-

16:29.120 --> 16:30.880
Hey, brother, you don't have a smile today?

16:30.880 --> 16:33.360
Why don't you borrow one of mine?

16:33.360 --> 16:34.000
Can I say something, Justin?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.200
I hate you both so much.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.640
Can I say something to you right now, Justin?

16:37.440 --> 16:38.160
Tell me.

16:38.160 --> 16:38.800
I'm loving it.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.560
I hate you.

16:40.560 --> 16:41.600
Just your attitude.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.160
Like, I'm loving it.

16:42.160 --> 16:42.880
I hate you guys so much.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.240
They should change the slogan now.

16:44.240 --> 16:47.120
I've seen you interact with fast food employees.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.560
I'm loving your attitude.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.320
That's a new slogan.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.600
I get accused of being too friendly with people.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.960
I'll use first names.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.120
I'm a real sweetheart.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.440
They don't appreciate it at McDonald's.

16:59.440 --> 17:00.400
I will say that.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.320
You're not allowed back in your McDonald's for a while.

17:02.320 --> 17:05.360
My carefree attitude does not seem to be winning me any friends there.

17:05.360 --> 17:06.240
Maybe they do.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.240
Maybe I inspire them to go get a different job.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.960
Because like I said, I do not see the same person twice.

17:12.560 --> 17:16.720
Ever since we were kids, I've always had a bit of a crush on my best friend's little sister.

17:16.720 --> 17:20.240
She's two years younger than me, while my best friend is the same age as I.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.440
My best friend and I have been friends since we were toddlers,

17:23.440 --> 17:25.040
and our families are pretty close.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.240
We're practically siblings.

17:26.240 --> 17:29.840
In high school, I never paid much attention to little sister,

17:29.840 --> 17:34.720
but now that we're both in university, she's grown up, rather than just being the kid sister.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.320
I don't make things awkward with the big sister, nor our families.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.280
On the flip side, I don't think she has much interest in me anyway.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.440
Do I even have a problem?

17:43.440 --> 17:49.680
This person had a crisis of confidence like midway through the question.

17:49.680 --> 17:53.920
Oh, shit, because I misread that at first and thought that they were saying that the big sister

17:53.920 --> 17:55.840
had no interest in them.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.720
No, big sister's in quotes, as if to say the little sister that grew up.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.160
Oh, no, I think big sister is the little sister's big sister.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.560
I think the best friend is also a sister.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.560
Man, this shit's getting complex.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.120
Finish the question.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.160
So, I know there are the fish in the sea, but if I did want to pursue her romantically,

18:14.160 --> 18:16.240
what would be a safe way to do that?

18:16.240 --> 18:18.960
That's from foolishly overcomplicates things.

18:18.960 --> 18:22.160
Well, you are doing that.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.520
And you are overcomplicating it.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.800
That is a thing that you've done.

18:24.800 --> 18:28.640
I mean, if you don't, it's all about pros and cons.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.360
You got to weigh them jelly beans, boy meets world style.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.760
You're saying that it's a big risk.

18:33.760 --> 18:39.760
It could possibly upset your friend who's been your best friend, nay, a sibling, your whole life,

18:40.560 --> 18:45.360
and you don't think that the little sister is interested in you like that anyway.

18:45.360 --> 18:48.880
Yeah, I would probably just sit this particular one out.

18:48.880 --> 18:56.800
Let me say, I would say that if you don't know by now, like you've been almost siblings,

18:56.800 --> 19:02.960
almost a member of this family since you were toddlers, and you are uncertain about this situation,

19:04.240 --> 19:06.080
that's a pretty clear sign.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.920
But I'm not, but I'm not sure.

19:07.920 --> 19:13.360
Sometimes it doesn't click with you until you realize the person has interest in you.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.120
Sometimes that can get the gears turning.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.080
Yeah, but I'm saying like-

19:16.080 --> 19:17.280
Well, I had never saw it.

19:17.280 --> 19:18.960
I had never thought of it that way.

19:18.960 --> 19:19.760
Let me mull that over.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.360
Let me flip the script though, Justin.

19:21.360 --> 19:26.880
What I'm saying is if you're not certain enough, if you have to ask us, it's not worth it.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.160
Because I think that goes both ways.

19:28.160 --> 19:31.040
I'm not saying if you're not certain that it's a mutual thing.

19:31.040 --> 19:34.560
I'm saying if you are uncertain, it doesn't sound like it's worth it.

19:34.560 --> 19:38.960
Don't fucking say that out loud though, because then nobody will send in questions or a show anymore.

19:38.960 --> 19:44.000
Like if you have to ask us, then no is the answer 100% of the time.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.680
It seems like in this circumstance, you've got a lot to lose for something that you're not prepared to fight for.

19:49.680 --> 19:50.960
But this is the-

19:50.960 --> 19:51.760
But or?

19:51.760 --> 19:52.640
But or?

19:52.640 --> 19:53.440
Way of life?

19:53.440 --> 19:54.720
But or is the new-

19:54.720 --> 19:55.840
But or-

19:55.840 --> 19:59.120
But or maybe it's true love in this.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.800
It's like your life mate and life partner.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.920
And like all of us are married now.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.240
So like we're all on team life partner.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.520
So I mean-

20:05.520 --> 20:07.520
This could be like a Harry Met Sally thing.

20:07.520 --> 20:08.560
You gotta fight for it.

20:08.560 --> 20:09.760
Gotta fight for it.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.840
Like Harry did when he met Sally.

20:11.840 --> 20:15.680
Love means having to fight every day.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.680
Quote, Harry Met Sally.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.680
It was my favorite thing.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.680
I'll have what she's having.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.680
True love for the rest of my life.

20:23.680 --> 20:30.400
I don't think you're jeopardizing the familial bonds by asking somebody out on a date.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.640
I mean if they say no, whatever, that's the end.

20:32.640 --> 20:39.120
If you go on a few casual dates, and you know it doesn't pan out, I don't think there's any danger in that either.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.120
Like I don't think that that's gonna be this like permanent-

20:41.120 --> 20:41.920
Let me-

20:41.920 --> 20:43.920
thing that you can never overcome.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.920
Let me ask this.

20:45.920 --> 20:51.920
Do they need to run it by the older sibling that they are like best friends with?

20:51.920 --> 20:55.920
It's once you uncork this, this bottle is so tenuously corked right now.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.920
But would you rather, would you rather they just go and ask for the date?

20:59.920 --> 21:03.920
I would rather you just take the cork and you push it so so hard down in that bottle.

21:03.920 --> 21:05.920
So we're in agreement that it's not worth it.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.920
I don't think that there's any prob-

21:07.920 --> 21:09.920
But there's no risk.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.920
I'm saying there's not a risk.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.920
Like there's not a risk with asking somebody out.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.920
Like that's not a problem.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.920
I think it's a problem if you're like-

21:17.920 --> 21:21.920
If you date for you know years and you have a terrible falling out, yeah that might create some awkwardness.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.920
But I have a saying I just came up with.

21:23.920 --> 21:27.920
That it's better to have loved and lost than not to have loved at all.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.920
That doesn't make sense to me.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.920
Yeah but what if you ask out little sister and older sibling's like,

21:31.920 --> 21:33.920
Hey did you ask out my little sister?

21:33.920 --> 21:37.920
Also when you lose shit, it sucks Justin.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.920
It sucks like a bunch.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.920
Have you ever lost your keys?

21:41.920 --> 21:43.920
Have you ever lost your keys? I love those keys in the car that they go into.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.920
But man they're gone. Fuck.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.920
I think you guys are not being very romantic right now.

21:47.920 --> 21:53.920
Who better to build a life with than somebody you've already shared your younger years with.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.920
How beautiful is that?

21:55.920 --> 21:57.920
Alright here. Let's play this game then Justin.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.920
Start bouncing off literally any scenario.

21:59.920 --> 22:05.920
Any scenario where you try to make this rainbow connection happen and I will tell you why it is the worst.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.920
Okay. I'm ready. I'm ready to play the game.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.920
Okay. Begin.

22:09.920 --> 22:13.920
Let me finish my first scenario first and then you can tell me.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.920
Alright.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.920
You ask her out. You go on dates.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.920
Assuming she says yes already.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.920
Boink.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.920
That was me poking a hole right in it.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.920
You fall in love. You get married.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.920
You have beautiful kids.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.920
Who's to say maybe you're shooting blanks.

22:29.920 --> 22:33.920
There are so many holes in this juicer.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.920
You can't live that way.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.920
Let me write this dialogue.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.920
Hey do you want to go on a date?

22:39.920 --> 22:41.920
You're like my sibling.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.920
I'm going to tell my sister about this.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.920
Tell sister you did what? Bye.

22:45.920 --> 22:49.920
And you're not getting those records back.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.920
You're definitely not getting those records back.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.920
And now you're out your Allman Brothers records.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.920
They were rare.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.920
What is the problem though?

22:57.920 --> 22:59.920
Why should it even be an issue that you ask my sister?

22:59.920 --> 23:01.920
Because you want your records back.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.920
I think you're confusing your metaphors.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.920
Here's a new mantra that I just came up with.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.920
Make new friends but keep the old.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.920
And definitely don't try to fuck them.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.920
Don't.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.920
Because they're gold and you'll lose them.

23:13.920 --> 23:15.920
And you shouldn't fuck gold.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.920
You shouldn't fuck gold.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.920
Travis suggested something.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.920
And normally I would never say this.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.920
But it was a decent idea.

23:23.920 --> 23:27.920
I think if you're close enough friends with the older sister.

23:27.920 --> 23:31.920
Then I think that it couldn't hurt to just run up by them and see.

23:31.920 --> 23:35.920
Have they ever mentioned in a romantic context.

23:35.920 --> 23:37.920
Hey he's looking pretty good.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.920
He's looking like he's going to work out.

23:39.920 --> 23:43.920
Are you saying would it bother you if I asked your sister out?

23:43.920 --> 23:45.920
Yeah it would.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.920
I don't think they'll do that though.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.920
I think you're putting them in a position where they can't say no.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.920
But then you know what they don't get to do?

23:51.920 --> 23:53.920
Complain later.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.920
They do because you want to fuck their sister.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.920
I'm not saying you ask for permission.

23:57.920 --> 23:59.920
I'm saying you float it.

23:59.920 --> 24:01.920
Spitball it.

24:01.920 --> 24:03.920
Hey your sister's looking pretty good.

24:03.920 --> 24:07.920
You don't turn into some kind of weird sex robot.

24:07.920 --> 24:09.920
You know who's looking real good nowadays?

24:09.920 --> 24:11.920
Your sister.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.920
Really grown up.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.920
Not so little anymore is she?

24:15.920 --> 24:17.920
I don't think you want to position it.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.920
Look at them curves.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.920
Hachi-machi.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.920
I don't know what got into you guys.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.920
Make the dog want a bag.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.920
What?

24:27.920 --> 24:29.920
What was the last name?

24:29.920 --> 24:31.920
What? What did you say?

24:31.920 --> 24:41.920
I don't understand why floating it by her older sister to see if she's ever thought of you in that context or what she thinks.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.920
Why that has to become bargaining for her.

24:43.920 --> 24:47.920
I like the hammies on her.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.920
First off I don't know what hammies would be.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.920
Why do you make them out of hamstrings you perv?

24:51.920 --> 24:53.920
Why?

24:53.920 --> 24:55.920
Why are you checking out her little sister's hamstrings?

24:55.920 --> 24:57.920
But also like once you do this.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.920
No he meant her hamstrings.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.920
Once you do this.

25:01.920 --> 25:11.920
Once your lifelong friend nay sibling knows that like you have been eyeing her little sister in that way in any context at all.

25:11.920 --> 25:15.920
It is going to be if she also thinks it's like a familial bond it's going to creep her right the fuck out.

25:15.920 --> 25:25.920
Listen I am always on the side of like just ask her silly but I'm telling you that there are certain situations where I think that can be very very very counterproductive.

25:25.920 --> 25:29.920
Would it be as weird if it was her brother that was your friend?

25:29.920 --> 25:31.920
If it was like you and a dude and you were asking out his little sister.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.920
Yeah.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.920
Or if it was reversed and it was like two girls wanting to ask out like an older brother.

25:35.920 --> 25:37.920
I don't think gender plays any role in this.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.920
I think it's all about siblings.

25:39.920 --> 25:45.920
I want personally for me I don't know if everybody feels this way and I'm not even sure like I feel this way at this point in the podcast.

25:45.920 --> 25:49.920
But I wanted my siblings to be happy before the show started at least.

25:49.920 --> 25:55.920
And if you think that your friend could make your sibling happy at least in like a dating sense early in a relationship.

25:55.920 --> 25:59.920
I don't see why it would be such a terrible crime for you to want to ask them out.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.920
Real talk.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.920
Real talk.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.920
Oh finally.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.920
Here's what I think.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.920
I imagine this is what Marc Maron's show is.

26:09.920 --> 26:13.920
It's because we're all quietly very angry with the other two people.

26:13.920 --> 26:19.920
For the lack of professionalism and preparedness that I have come to expect over the past 180 episodes from you two.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.920
Okay so real talk.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.920
Okay.

26:23.920 --> 26:29.920
You need to analyze within yourself if this is a passing fancy because this is a girl you know who now is hot.

26:29.920 --> 26:35.920
Or if you really have some real feelings that you're willing to like risk something for.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.920
And then step two.

26:37.920 --> 26:41.920
I think you definitely need to float it by the older sibling.

26:41.920 --> 26:43.920
Yeah but I just haven't figured it out yet.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.920
Like I'm pretty good at figuring that kind of stuff out.

26:45.920 --> 26:49.920
And I haven't figured out yet how you broach that without sounding like a bridge troll.

26:49.920 --> 26:54.920
You just say like hey I don't want it to be weird but I'd like to ask your little sister out.

26:54.920 --> 26:55.920
Is that okay?

26:55.920 --> 26:57.920
I guess frankness is the best course of action.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.920
Because then they go no.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.920
And you go okay cool then never mind.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.920
And if they say yes.

27:03.920 --> 27:08.920
Then no they say no and then you want it more than anything you've ever wanted in your entire life.

27:08.920 --> 27:09.920
Well then there's that.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.920
Then it's the sweetest fruit.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.920
Gross.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.920
I'm changing the name of this show to gross-a-rooney.

27:15.920 --> 27:18.920
Because that is how I feel full time right now.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.920
Gross-a-rooney.

27:20.920 --> 27:23.920
That's actually Mickey Brooney's little sister that I wanted to ask out.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.920
And he wouldn't let you because he wasn't a lemon.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.920
And then she was all I wanted.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.920
That's all you can think about.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.920
That Mona Lisa smile.

27:31.920 --> 27:32.920
She was 86.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.920
She was 86 years old.

27:36.920 --> 27:37.920
She looks good though.

27:37.920 --> 27:38.920
Hey.

27:38.920 --> 27:39.920
Oh so good.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.920
Y'all looks good.

27:41.920 --> 27:42.920
Drop me a store.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.920
Gross-a-rooney.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.920
Like a dog want a bag.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.920
Come on you can't.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.920
This cannot be a new thing.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.920
He said it again and I didn't hear it the second time.

27:52.920 --> 27:53.920
Like a dog.

27:53.920 --> 27:54.920
I hate that guy.

27:54.920 --> 27:55.920
I don't know who the guy is but I hate that guy.

27:55.920 --> 27:56.920
You don't like that guy?

27:56.920 --> 27:57.920
I don't like that guy.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.920
Like a dog want a bag.

27:59.920 --> 28:01.920
Yep nailed it.

28:01.920 --> 28:04.920
It doesn't make sense to me.

28:04.920 --> 28:06.920
Well just mull it over.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.920
Speaking of begging.

28:08.920 --> 28:09.920
We need some money.

28:09.920 --> 28:10.920
So let's go to the money section.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.920
Is beg one of the words he said?

28:22.920 --> 28:23.920
Trav who's this message for?

28:23.920 --> 28:24.920
This is for Christian Ridley.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.920
Griffin who's this message from?

28:26.920 --> 28:27.920
It's from Jacob Ridley.

28:27.920 --> 28:29.920
Justin what is this message?

28:29.920 --> 28:31.920
To my brother Christian happy.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.920
To my brother.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.920
Okay the brother's name is Christian.

28:35.920 --> 28:36.920
To my brother Christian.

28:36.920 --> 28:37.920
God bless you.

28:37.920 --> 28:38.920
Brother Christian.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.920
Is he speaking in the colloquial sentence?

28:40.920 --> 28:42.920
Happy late birthday.

28:42.920 --> 28:43.920
Merry late Christmas.

28:43.920 --> 28:44.920
And happy new year.

28:44.920 --> 28:51.920
I hope you enjoy your top three favorite brothers reading message from your fourth favorite brother.

28:51.920 --> 28:52.920
That's a tough one to admit.

28:52.920 --> 28:53.920
Thank you.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.920
Thank you Jacob for being damn enough.

28:55.920 --> 28:56.920
Honestly it's the first step.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.920
Thanks for introducing me to my bim bam.

28:58.920 --> 29:03.920
And I hope this makes up for my previously lacking gift giving history.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.920
From Jacob the obvious golden child.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.920
They are the last man of Jacob.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.920
Lot of truth in this Jacob.

29:10.920 --> 29:11.920
Fourth favorite brother.

29:11.920 --> 29:12.920
First favorite son.

29:12.920 --> 29:15.920
Is there any metric for how bad we fucked this up?

29:15.920 --> 29:17.920
And how much we miss his birthday by?

29:17.920 --> 29:19.920
Hey we didn't miss his birthday.

29:19.920 --> 29:23.920
No I think we're right in the sweet spot.

29:23.920 --> 29:25.920
It says merry late Christmas and happy new year.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.920
We're like on the money.

29:27.920 --> 29:31.920
Jacob went into it saying oh I done missed it.

29:31.920 --> 29:37.920
If you give to ask us to tell someone a message for you.

29:37.920 --> 29:42.920
You might as honestly you might as well put it in a bottle and chuck it into a well.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.920
Here's the thing Jacob for future reference.

29:44.920 --> 29:45.920
That's the reliability.

29:45.920 --> 29:48.920
Jacob future reference don't include that you were late.

29:48.920 --> 29:49.920
Let us take that hit.

29:49.920 --> 29:50.920
That's what we're here to do.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.920
Take a load off Jacob.

29:52.920 --> 29:57.920
You say happy birthday two weeks in advance and then buy it whenever.

29:57.920 --> 30:04.920
A lot of time when someone has that we claim that we miss someone's birthday by weeks.

30:04.920 --> 30:08.920
We are literally getting a telegram from the person as the show is going on.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.920
Wait that's just in.

30:10.920 --> 30:11.920
Oh we fucked up.

30:11.920 --> 30:14.920
We should charge extra for fuck up mail.

30:14.920 --> 30:17.920
Let's just dig in the fuck up mail bag.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.920
Got a message for Tim Reinhart from Ed.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.920
Ed says dear Tim.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.920
I'm going to add dearest.

30:25.920 --> 30:26.920
Dearest Tim.

30:26.920 --> 30:27.920
My dearest Tim.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.920
To my dearest Tim.

30:29.920 --> 30:30.920
I write you from the front.

30:30.920 --> 30:36.920
Happy holidays to the biggest and pretty much only other Bim Bam fan I know.

30:36.920 --> 30:37.920
Well fuck thanks man.

30:37.920 --> 30:38.920
Just you two.

30:38.920 --> 30:39.920
Screw you too pal.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.920
Ed and Tim out there in the cold lonely oblivion.

30:42.920 --> 30:45.920
It's a gift for everybody it seems.

30:45.920 --> 30:48.920
Thanks for turning me on.

30:48.920 --> 30:55.920
Thanks for sharing this shitty unpopular show with me.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.920
Thanks for turning me on to Bim Bam while we were roommates.

30:58.920 --> 31:01.920
Hopefully this message makes it during the holidays.

31:01.920 --> 31:02.920
I squeaked in there.

31:02.920 --> 31:03.920
Yeah we did.

31:03.920 --> 31:10.920
This is normally more than I would spend on you so this also counts as your birthday present.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.920
Happy birthday Tim from your cousin Ed.

31:12.920 --> 31:16.920
You know normally I would think that someone was just inserting a sick burn.

31:16.920 --> 31:20.920
But I think that we were probably getting a little kidding on the square there.

31:20.920 --> 31:21.920
This was fucking.

31:21.920 --> 31:22.920
This was like.

31:22.920 --> 31:27.920
This is one of the best money zone spots we've ever had because it was it was deprecating

31:27.920 --> 31:31.920
in first second and third person which I really appreciated.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.920
No one came away from this unscathed.

31:33.920 --> 31:36.920
There was a little bit of something a little bit of something from it was the Dick's last

31:36.920 --> 31:39.920
resort of Jumbotron spots.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.920
Speaking of Dick's last resort.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.920
Oh it's Extreme Restraints.

31:44.920 --> 31:45.920
The magic is back.

31:45.920 --> 31:46.920
Oh man.

31:46.920 --> 31:53.920
Extremerestraints.com is your adult superstore for everything you can fuck and stick in holes.

31:53.920 --> 31:54.920
God it feels good to curse again.

31:54.920 --> 31:57.920
I did miss it during the candle nights.

31:57.920 --> 31:58.920
Spectacular.

31:58.920 --> 32:02.920
As much as we enjoyed doing that one candle nights episode where you had to talk about

32:02.920 --> 32:06.920
Extreme Restraints in clean ways like you really got to like get into the filth to really

32:06.920 --> 32:09.920
paint a word picture.

32:09.920 --> 32:14.920
What's your 2014 going to be like because let me suggest this.

32:14.920 --> 32:17.920
Maybe you should just like fucking get it.

32:17.920 --> 32:18.920
Yeah.

32:18.920 --> 32:19.920
Are you getting it?

32:19.920 --> 32:22.920
Mix it up a little bit with a size matters penis and larger.

32:22.920 --> 32:27.920
This thing you put your penis in this and it is it's like sending it away to boot camp.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.920
It is going to come back a changed penis.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.920
I'm just saying spice it up.

32:31.920 --> 32:32.920
Yeah.

32:32.920 --> 32:33.920
Spice it up.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.920
Right now you a little white rice.

32:35.920 --> 32:36.920
Yep.

32:36.920 --> 32:39.920
You need to throw some sriracha in there before it's discontinued.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.920
Do they have sriracha lube or something?

32:41.920 --> 32:42.920
I bet they do.

32:42.920 --> 32:43.920
I bet they do.

32:43.920 --> 32:44.920
It seems sriracha everything is happening.

32:44.920 --> 32:46.920
You could actually just use sriracha sriracha lube.

32:46.920 --> 32:49.920
A little tip from me to you will save a little money.

32:49.920 --> 32:50.920
Don't.

32:50.920 --> 32:51.920
Don't.

32:51.920 --> 32:52.920
Don't.

32:52.920 --> 32:53.920
This is the reason that we have a disclaimer at the beginning of the episode saying don't

32:53.920 --> 32:55.920
do anything these chuckle fucks say.

32:55.920 --> 32:56.920
Just throw some sriracha.

32:56.920 --> 32:59.920
I burnt my dick and he burnt his butthole.

32:59.920 --> 33:00.920
Thanks my bim bam.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.920
That'll be two billion dollars.

33:03.920 --> 33:07.920
Go to ExtremeRestraints.com to buy things with the coupon code sexabunga and save 20 percent.

33:07.920 --> 33:13.920
But stay for the oddly confrontational pictures of naked people holding sex toys.

33:13.920 --> 33:18.920
A lot of these people are staring directly at you challenging your own preconceived notions

33:18.920 --> 33:20.920
about what sexual pleasure means.

33:20.920 --> 33:25.920
I highly recommend the picture of the gentleman on the hollow stainless steel anal plug.

33:25.920 --> 33:30.920
He's holding it saying are you man enough and the answer is I don't know.

33:30.920 --> 33:32.920
But there's only one way to find out in there.

33:32.920 --> 33:33.920
Yeah.

33:33.920 --> 33:34.920
Go to ExtremeRestraints.com.

33:34.920 --> 33:35.920
2014.

33:35.920 --> 33:36.920
Are you man enough?

33:36.920 --> 33:37.920
Are you man enough?

33:37.920 --> 33:38.920
Are you woman enough?

33:38.920 --> 33:39.920
Cram it.

33:39.920 --> 33:40.920
Cram it.

33:40.920 --> 33:41.920
2014.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.920
Hey are you cram enough?

33:44.920 --> 33:49.920
Are you strong enough to be my cram?

33:49.920 --> 33:50.920
Extreme Restraints.

33:50.920 --> 33:51.920
That's the new coupon code.

33:51.920 --> 33:55.920
If sexabunga gets hacked we will change it to are you strong enough to be my cram?

33:55.920 --> 33:58.920
Got a real cram going now.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.920
Welcome to the space cram.

34:01.920 --> 34:02.920
It's your chance.

34:02.920 --> 34:05.920
Get a butt plug at the space cram.

34:05.920 --> 34:08.920
I love Extreme Restraints and I would never do anything to hurt them.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.920
But can we open up our own sex toys store called Space Cram?

34:11.920 --> 34:13.920
Here's what we sell.

34:13.920 --> 34:14.920
You ready?

34:14.920 --> 34:19.920
One of those thick plastic cased VHS tapes of Space Jam.

34:19.920 --> 34:23.920
And we say in the product description put it in your butt maybe.

34:23.920 --> 34:26.920
We sell sex toys and organizational tools.

34:26.920 --> 34:30.920
Sergio Diaz plays in a band called Os Mutantes.

34:30.920 --> 34:34.920
His life was changed the first time he heard Elvis Presley.

34:34.920 --> 34:37.920
The great thing in the world it is to discover.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.920
I mean there's nothing better.

34:39.920 --> 34:40.920
I'm Jesse Thorne.

34:40.920 --> 34:43.920
My show Bullseye is about discovery.

34:43.920 --> 34:49.920
We help you find the best music, the best movies, the best books and we talk to the people who make them.

34:49.920 --> 34:56.920
It's Bullseye from Maximumfun.org and NPR.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.920
I'm stuck in the runway.

34:58.920 --> 34:59.920
I'm super thirsty.

34:59.920 --> 35:04.920
Do you have any suggestions for sweet beverage cart hacks like your subway hacks?

35:04.920 --> 35:07.920
I want to get as much refreshment as my ticket allows me to.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.920
That's from Thirsty Dude.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.920
They have to keep giving you drinks.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.920
They have to keep giving you drinks.

35:13.920 --> 35:17.920
If you tell them you're parched, if you press the little button and say I'm parched, they'll bring you something.

35:17.920 --> 35:19.920
I think it's going to be water though.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.920
I think after the initial beverage.

35:21.920 --> 35:22.920
That's my favorite.

35:22.920 --> 35:27.920
Sometimes you get on those little like jumps where it's like a 45 minute flight and they come on and go,

35:27.920 --> 35:32.920
Dude, the short flight, we're just going to be doing water.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.920
And it's like, I feel like it's really is a loophole.

35:34.920 --> 35:38.920
You guys like you have to do better in service, but you're just oh yeah, you can't get up.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.920
Hey, you can't be like, I'll have a Bloody Mary.

35:40.920 --> 35:45.920
And I'm like, that's the whole flight is that you they prepare the Bloody Mary for you.

35:45.920 --> 35:48.920
It seems like a mojito and the next three hours of your life.

35:48.920 --> 35:54.920
I actually don't like when they don't have a beverage cart because then they're just like coming to you and ask.

35:54.920 --> 35:58.920
To me, I feel better about asking if you already have the drink there.

35:58.920 --> 36:04.920
If you got to walk all the way up to the moving plane to get my soda, I can usually just wait.

36:04.920 --> 36:06.920
Yeah, and you feel pretty guilty about that.

36:06.920 --> 36:11.920
Isn't there something about it and there's something about how you're supposed to, if you order Diet Coke,

36:11.920 --> 36:14.920
they'll just give you the can because there's something about the altitude.

36:14.920 --> 36:21.920
Like Diet Coke takes so long for the like the head of the Diet Coke to go down that it takes them forever to pour it.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.920
And it's sort of like a economy of scale thing at that point.

36:24.920 --> 36:27.920
So they just give you the can so that you can pour the rest of it yourself.

36:27.920 --> 36:28.920
Isn't that a thing?

36:28.920 --> 36:29.920
I feel like that's the thing.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.920
I mean, the best hack is to hope that your seat mate falls asleep and that you don't know them.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.920
And then you just order their drink for them.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.920
Say like, I would like a Coke and they would like a ginger ale.

36:38.920 --> 36:39.920
And then you just fucking drink their drink.

36:39.920 --> 36:43.920
I like that you lean enough into the roost that you'll drink two different drinks.

36:43.920 --> 36:44.920
You don't want to do the same thing.

36:44.920 --> 36:47.920
Well yeah, you don't want to make it seem like you out have two Diet Cokes.

36:47.920 --> 36:48.920
One's for him.

36:48.920 --> 36:55.920
Do you guys ever feel like, and we are dangerously stepping close to the airplane food joke line,

36:55.920 --> 36:59.920
we may have actually stepped over it already, but I think this is useful information.

36:59.920 --> 37:04.920
I have a real problem with, and maybe it's just because I always get seated at like the very, very, very back of the plane,

37:04.920 --> 37:12.920
but I always get the drink and then they give it to me and I have to put the little tray table down,

37:12.920 --> 37:15.920
which I don't like doing because I have like, you know, I'm playing Animal Crossing down there.

37:15.920 --> 37:17.920
I'm jerking off or something.

37:17.920 --> 37:20.920
You're jerking off playing Animal Crossing.

37:20.920 --> 37:21.920
I'm doing both at once.

37:21.920 --> 37:25.920
I'm like, I don't like having the tray table down, but I always feel like they come, give you a drink.

37:25.920 --> 37:27.920
You have about 45 seconds and they come to get out of the trash.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.920
Like, no, wait, oh, wait.

37:29.920 --> 37:35.920
Can you come back in like 15 minutes, which is like how long it takes me to crush a whole can of Diet Coke?

37:35.920 --> 37:37.920
No, 45 seconds is all I get, huh?

37:37.920 --> 37:40.920
So I guess I better toss this now or like go the rest of the plane ride with my tray table down.

37:40.920 --> 37:43.920
That's why you got to get the beverage and then run down the aisle away from them drinking it.

37:43.920 --> 37:51.920
I like, I actually am equally irritated by the opposite situation where maybe I missed that first pass

37:51.920 --> 37:57.920
and then I finished my drink like right after and then for the next 15 minutes, this cup is my life.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.920
This is everything that's happening to me right now.

37:59.920 --> 38:03.920
That's why you got to tuck it into the little sack in front of the little satchel in the seat.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.920
Yeah, but then you look like a dirty boy for whoever you're sitting next to.

38:06.920 --> 38:07.920
Oh, yes.

38:07.920 --> 38:08.920
Are you going to leave it there?

38:08.920 --> 38:11.920
That's where I have my, I leave it there every time though.

38:11.920 --> 38:12.920
Me too.

38:12.920 --> 38:14.920
That's where I have all my entertainment.

38:14.920 --> 38:15.920
Oh, that's dangerous.

38:15.920 --> 38:21.920
You get up and get, you know, you catch a connecting flight to Dallas and then you catch another connecting flight back to Austin.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.920
You're like, oh shit, my iPad is in Nashville.

38:24.920 --> 38:25.920
Idiot.

38:25.920 --> 38:28.920
I got a pretty good beverage hack for you if you want to get the most out of it.

38:28.920 --> 38:34.920
Get their like expensive seats that you can get in the front of the plane.

38:34.920 --> 38:38.920
And man, those motherfuckers are thirsty up in first class.

38:38.920 --> 38:39.920
I tell you what.

38:39.920 --> 38:40.920
Boy, howdy.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.920
They need their drink.

38:42.920 --> 38:46.920
They need their drink while the commoners are still getting seated.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.920
They have to have a drink.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.920
They can't wait for you to get to your seat.

38:50.920 --> 38:51.920
They have to have a drink right then.

38:51.920 --> 38:53.920
They were so fucking thirsty.

38:53.920 --> 38:58.920
When I flew back from Scotland, we did the like priority plus or whatever.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.920
And it was like only 80 bucks extra.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.920
And like you get complimentary beer and wine.

39:03.920 --> 39:06.920
That still doesn't sound like it makes up for 80 bucks.

39:06.920 --> 39:07.920
For nine hours?

39:07.920 --> 39:08.920
Yeah, man.

39:08.920 --> 39:10.920
You just gotta like really fucking work for it.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.920
You gotta really commit.

39:12.920 --> 39:13.920
Yeah.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.920
You gotta have nothing left to lose.

39:15.920 --> 39:19.920
I guess that's kind of a weird thing to think on your honeymoon, but sure.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.920
Well, you got a nine hour flight, man.

39:21.920 --> 39:22.920
Who are you trying to impress?

39:22.920 --> 39:24.920
This is the most special honeymoon ever, baby.

39:24.920 --> 39:26.920
I just feel like we have nothing left to lose.

39:26.920 --> 39:27.920
Glug, glug, glug, glug, glug.

39:27.920 --> 39:30.920
My favorite moment, we were flying back from your wedding, Griffin.

39:30.920 --> 39:33.920
We were on this flight and it had been delayed and it was like a crazy thing.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.920
And this dude was on the flight with us who was clearly drunk.

39:35.920 --> 39:39.920
Like he reeked of booze and like fell asleep as soon as he sat down on the plane.

39:39.920 --> 39:43.920
And the flight attendant woke him up as she was coming back through and was like,

39:43.920 --> 39:44.920
can I get you a drink?

39:44.920 --> 39:46.920
And he was like, huh, wine.

39:46.920 --> 39:51.920
And she was like, well, I mean, that costs money.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.920
And he goes, oh, oh, nothing.

39:54.920 --> 39:56.920
And fell immediately back asleep.

39:56.920 --> 39:57.920
That's a pretty cool scene.

39:57.920 --> 39:59.920
And that man is my favorite man.

39:59.920 --> 40:00.920
That's a good guy.

40:00.920 --> 40:03.920
Can we talk about 2014?

40:03.920 --> 40:09.920
I feel like by this point we've come up with like a catch phrase.

40:09.920 --> 40:12.920
And I feel like we're sort of slacking that we haven't done that yet.

40:12.920 --> 40:17.920
That we haven't, like, sort of like, so to review.

40:17.920 --> 40:19.920
20 does.

40:19.920 --> 40:20.920
20 does.

40:20.920 --> 40:21.920
Getting it in 20 does.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.920
Yeah, and then we had 20 dirt.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.920
20 dirt, dig it up, get it out.

40:25.920 --> 40:26.920
Get it out.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.920
Now we're in 2014.

40:28.920 --> 40:30.920
I want to hit you guys with this.

40:30.920 --> 40:36.920
What do you think about 2014 where we get into sports deep?

40:36.920 --> 40:38.920
Let me throw this out.

40:38.920 --> 40:41.920
20 forte, what's your specialty?

40:41.920 --> 40:42.920
Oh, that's not bad.

40:42.920 --> 40:44.920
That's actually not bad.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.920
I'm kind of into sports already.

40:46.920 --> 40:48.920
Yeah, that's something.

40:48.920 --> 40:52.920
20 forte is about a challenge to you and find out what makes you special.

40:52.920 --> 40:55.920
Gain some confidence in the thing that makes you you.

40:55.920 --> 40:56.920
Let me bounce mine off you.

40:56.920 --> 41:03.920
I'm feeling really good about 2015 already.

41:03.920 --> 41:08.920
2014 might be all right, but I think 2015 is where we are really going to cash in.

41:08.920 --> 41:14.920
What if this was like a year of preparation?

41:14.920 --> 41:18.920
What if this was like 20 fortify?

41:18.920 --> 41:21.920
I like 20 fortify.

41:21.920 --> 41:31.920
Maybe you get in shape for the big, big moves you're going to make in 2015, which is going to be a fucking killer, stellar year.

41:31.920 --> 41:40.920
Honestly, Griffin, and I know that I've probably thought this before, but to me, 2015 sounds so goddamn futuristic.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.920
That'll never happen.

41:42.920 --> 41:43.920
It'll never happen.

41:43.920 --> 41:44.920
There's no way.

41:44.920 --> 41:48.920
I mean, the way that Obama's running this country, you're probably not so far off.

41:48.920 --> 41:51.920
Let me hit you guys with this.

41:51.920 --> 41:56.920
20 fart teen.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.920
I mean, that certainly has its merits.

41:58.920 --> 41:59.920
I think the problem-

41:59.920 --> 42:01.920
There's nothing to go along with that.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.920
Can I hit you guys with another one?

42:03.920 --> 42:05.920
Just 20 fart.

42:05.920 --> 42:09.920
And mine was just Travis's.

42:09.920 --> 42:10.920
What about this?

42:10.920 --> 42:11.920
Oh, no.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.920
See, we missed this because I was thinking 2014.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.920
That works better with 13.

42:16.920 --> 42:23.920
My problem with Forte and Fortify is that they both presume a lot about the person.

42:23.920 --> 42:26.920
We don't know who's in a rebuilding year and who's not.

42:26.920 --> 42:27.920
It's not a rebuilding year.

42:27.920 --> 42:28.920
It's not a rebuilding year.

42:28.920 --> 42:30.920
You might have this shit already.

42:30.920 --> 42:32.920
You got to fortify that stuff.

42:32.920 --> 42:43.920
It's like, okay, if you're playing the risk, you take the territory, so you've got it, and now it's about just shoring up your numbers.

42:43.920 --> 42:45.920
Shoring up your resources right there to the borderlands.

42:45.920 --> 42:46.920
That is what I'm saying.

42:46.920 --> 42:47.920
Maybe you've already got some shit.

42:47.920 --> 42:49.920
Every year can't be a growth year.

42:49.920 --> 42:50.920
No.

42:50.920 --> 42:51.920
You're going to overstretch your bounds.

42:51.920 --> 42:52.920
No.

42:52.920 --> 42:55.920
We are going to need to really pool our resources.

42:55.920 --> 43:04.920
As a community, as the Mbim-bam nation, we really need to get together and huddle around for warmth and just get ready for 2015.

43:04.920 --> 43:10.920
I don't want to paint a bleak picture because 2015, we have a light at the end of the tunnel.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.920
It's 2015, and it's going to be fucking incredible.

43:12.920 --> 43:17.920
What if it's just 20 forts, and it's just a year of building a lot of blanket forts?

43:17.920 --> 43:20.920
That would be charming.

43:20.920 --> 43:26.920
My worry with fortify is that we've been talking about how we need to do live shows in 2014,

43:26.920 --> 43:35.920
and I'm worried if we go ahead and proclaim 2014 as a year of basically turtling and hoarding resources and stuff.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.920
We'll use it as an excuse to not do that.

43:37.920 --> 43:38.920
No, no, no.

43:38.920 --> 43:43.920
We have this fan base already, and we are going to start losing these motherfuckers.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.920
I don't know if you guys have seen our numbers.

43:45.920 --> 43:47.920
The bleed has already begun.

43:47.920 --> 43:51.920
The only way we're going to keep them is if we put some fucking FaceTime on the books.

43:51.920 --> 43:52.920
That's what I'm saying.

43:52.920 --> 43:57.920
Griffin, let me throw out the opposite and just go with 20 forward.

43:57.920 --> 43:59.920
Oh, my God.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.920
Oh, Travis.

44:01.920 --> 44:03.920
That is visionary.

44:03.920 --> 44:04.920
20 forward.

44:04.920 --> 44:07.920
But you're kind of usurping my grand vision.

44:07.920 --> 44:08.920
This is about momentum.

44:08.920 --> 44:09.920
This is about acceleration.

44:09.920 --> 44:12.920
This is about moving forward.

44:12.920 --> 44:14.920
20 forward.

44:14.920 --> 44:19.920
If you don't do 20 forward, you can't get to where you need to be to experience 20 forward.

44:19.920 --> 44:20.920
I like that.

44:20.920 --> 44:21.920
I like that message better.

44:21.920 --> 44:24.920
By the way, let me get this out of the way right now.

44:24.920 --> 44:26.920
Got to be 20 griff teen.

44:26.920 --> 44:28.920
It's got to be 20 griff teen.

44:28.920 --> 44:30.920
If we do make it there, it's going to be a great one.

44:30.920 --> 44:32.920
That's going to be all about griff teen.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.920
What you guys can't see is there's that hand motion that goes along with 20 forward,

44:35.920 --> 44:39.920
and it's like a hand swooping for like 20 forward.

44:39.920 --> 44:40.920
You're reaching out.

44:40.920 --> 44:44.920
Is 20 griff teen like grift like you're fucking over other people, or is it like for me?

44:44.920 --> 44:45.920
Like for me?

44:45.920 --> 44:46.920
Both.

44:46.920 --> 44:48.920
I don't really grift that many people.

44:48.920 --> 44:49.920
I'm missing a good opportunity.

44:49.920 --> 44:50.920
Well, you will in 20 griff teen.

44:50.920 --> 44:51.920
I probably will.

44:51.920 --> 44:53.920
Yeah, in griff teen, you're going to get real.

44:53.920 --> 44:57.920
So move forward with your grifting abilities.

44:57.920 --> 45:01.920
Maybe learn some sleight of hand.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.920
You don't do enough three-card Monty.

45:03.920 --> 45:05.920
I've told you that before.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.920
Have you ever forged an identity?

45:07.920 --> 45:08.920
This is the time to do it.

45:08.920 --> 45:09.920
How is your ledger mane?

45:09.920 --> 45:11.920
Is it okay?

45:11.920 --> 45:16.920
I'm going to say we stick with 20 forward now unless something better comes to us.

45:16.920 --> 45:17.920
I like 20 forward.

45:17.920 --> 45:18.920
Me too.

45:18.920 --> 45:20.920
I like the optimism of it.

45:20.920 --> 45:23.920
We got it out in 2013 this year.

45:23.920 --> 45:24.920
We got it out the dirt.

45:24.920 --> 45:27.920
Now it's time to move forward, move on away from the dirt.

45:27.920 --> 45:31.920
Speaking of live shows, I think I know a pretty good place to do one,

45:31.920 --> 45:33.920
and that's wherever Tim and Ed live.

45:33.920 --> 45:36.920
That seems to be a hotbed of Mabim Bam fandom.

45:36.920 --> 45:38.920
I think they just live on a frozen lake.

45:38.920 --> 45:39.920
That's what I picture.

45:39.920 --> 45:42.920
Yeah, that's probably accurate.

45:42.920 --> 45:46.920
That's probably the only scenario in which there are two Mabim Bam listeners,

45:46.920 --> 45:50.920
is if there's a frozen lake somewhere, not just like, I don't know,

45:50.920 --> 45:56.920
maybe the entire state of Montana or maybe like 26 other states like Montana.

45:56.920 --> 46:01.920
Basically every state that's not California or Texas or New York.

46:01.920 --> 46:03.920
Thanks, California, Texas, and New York.

46:03.920 --> 46:05.920
You are really keeping us afloat.

46:05.920 --> 46:06.920
Thanks, guys.

46:06.920 --> 46:10.920
By the way, maybe tell somebody about the show this week if you could.

46:10.920 --> 46:15.920
Maybe if we can get like three strong listenership in Utah and Montana

46:15.920 --> 46:18.920
and the Dakotas, the Badlands.

46:18.920 --> 46:20.920
Tim and Ed, that's your mission right now.

46:20.920 --> 46:22.920
Yeah, just tell anyone else that Tim and Ed knows.

46:22.920 --> 46:25.920
We are bone dry in the Badlands.

46:25.920 --> 46:28.920
We've got to get that stuff wet.

46:28.920 --> 46:29.920
I got another question.

46:29.920 --> 46:31.920
I'm a lover of knowledge,

46:31.920 --> 46:34.920
and I spend my time researching science, tech, and culture topics.

46:34.920 --> 46:36.920
I sometimes cannot contain my excitement about these things

46:36.920 --> 46:38.920
and add them to conversations with my family.

46:38.920 --> 46:41.920
My older brother has become annoyed with this and repeatedly says,

46:41.920 --> 46:43.920
you've got too much time on your hands.

46:43.920 --> 46:45.920
What does that even mean?

46:45.920 --> 46:46.920
Is this supposed to be an insult?

46:46.920 --> 46:48.920
Is he telling me to stop learning?

46:48.920 --> 46:51.920
Do you think I should continue sharing things I learn or stop?

46:51.920 --> 46:54.920
That's from Jonathan, who isn't going to come up with a nom de plume.

46:54.920 --> 46:56.920
He's happy just being Jonathan.

46:56.920 --> 46:58.920
20 forward.

46:58.920 --> 47:00.920
How is that applicable at all?

47:00.920 --> 47:03.920
I think it means your brother can go fuck himself.

47:03.920 --> 47:06.920
So maybe your brother needs to go 20 backward on his attitude.

47:06.920 --> 47:10.920
I'm just saying that what it sounds like to me is, listen,

47:10.920 --> 47:14.920
learning and growing and being interested in random facts

47:14.920 --> 47:17.920
is one of the most beautiful things in the world to me.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.920
So that idea of your brother getting annoyed with it,

47:19.920 --> 47:23.920
it seems to me like maybe it's just not his scene.

47:23.920 --> 47:25.920
But there ain't nothing wrong with it.

47:25.920 --> 47:27.920
You don't do what this dude is doing.

47:27.920 --> 47:31.920
You don't have to stop, obviously, and you should definitely keep learning.

47:31.920 --> 47:37.920
But there's a time and a place for that kind of stuff.

47:37.920 --> 47:43.920
And there are circles of people who enjoy that kind of heady discussion.

47:43.920 --> 47:48.920
And if your brother's talking about how his kid did at a soccer game,

47:48.920 --> 47:51.920
he doesn't want to hear about the origins of the sport.

47:51.920 --> 47:54.920
You know what I mean? He just wants to talk about his kid.

47:54.920 --> 47:57.920
It sounds to me like what you need to work on, Jonathan,

47:57.920 --> 48:01.920
is the beauty of a sequitur.

48:01.920 --> 48:05.920
Travis, you cannot be the one. You cannot be the tutor.

48:05.920 --> 48:07.920
No, listen, because I know it's not a strength,

48:07.920 --> 48:12.920
but God knows I've come miles from where I was when I was like 12.

48:12.920 --> 48:14.920
But I have watched this.

48:14.920 --> 48:19.920
That's just not like a super high bar to clear.

48:19.920 --> 48:22.920
Well, you know, you got to take it where you can get it.

48:22.920 --> 48:27.920
I am so much better at metaphors than I was when I was a baby.

48:27.920 --> 48:31.920
Well, I've got friends that know really interesting, amazing things

48:31.920 --> 48:33.920
about pop culture and science and all this stuff,

48:33.920 --> 48:36.920
but they don't wait for the prior conversation to end.

48:36.920 --> 48:39.920
They don't wait for a window to open up.

48:39.920 --> 48:43.920
They just say it, and that's always going to fall flat.

48:43.920 --> 48:44.920
You know what I mean?

48:44.920 --> 48:47.920
It's always going to seem really out of place and out of nowhere

48:47.920 --> 48:51.920
in a way that no one's going to jump to engage with it.

48:51.920 --> 48:54.920
Jonathan, the whole point of communication is to express ideas,

48:54.920 --> 48:57.920
thoughts, emotions, opinions, and it doesn't seem like,

48:57.920 --> 49:00.920
as far as trivia goes, your brother's really –

49:00.920 --> 49:02.920
I don't think he's really into getting it.

49:02.920 --> 49:09.920
So you got to wonder, like, if you're making these little bon mots

49:09.920 --> 49:14.920
for a specific reason, because if it's to entertain, delight, inform your brother,

49:14.920 --> 49:16.920
then like he is not into it.

49:16.920 --> 49:21.920
I would think it would be better to remain quiet, confident

49:21.920 --> 49:25.920
in your own personal knowledge and then wait for like a nice cocktail party

49:25.920 --> 49:29.920
or maybe a pub trivia where you can really let that flag fly.

49:29.920 --> 49:31.920
Juicer, I think you just nailed it, where I think the thing is,

49:31.920 --> 49:35.920
are you doing this for their benefit or for your own?

49:35.920 --> 49:39.920
Are you saying it to prove how intelligent and the stuff you know

49:39.920 --> 49:42.920
or because you think that this is a thing that will in some way,

49:42.920 --> 49:45.920
you know, improve their enjoyment of the thing that they're talking about?

49:45.920 --> 49:48.920
Because I think it's like anything else where you're talking about making friends

49:48.920 --> 49:52.920
or relationships of any kind is it's being interested in them.

49:52.920 --> 49:55.920
So are you doing this to turn the attention to yourself

49:55.920 --> 50:00.920
or to continue on their moment of conversation?

50:00.920 --> 50:02.920
Dale Carnegie's dead, right?

50:02.920 --> 50:03.920
Yeah.

50:03.920 --> 50:07.920
I'd have to imagine at this point, he gave too much of himself to be able to continue.

50:07.920 --> 50:10.920
I was just thinking about like royalties.

50:10.920 --> 50:12.920
Oh, okay. No, we're good.

50:12.920 --> 50:18.920
If it's been over seven years since he died, the trademark on his thoughts and ideas.

50:18.920 --> 50:19.920
No, we're safe.

50:19.920 --> 50:20.920
Okay, good.

50:20.920 --> 50:22.920
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo answer question?

50:22.920 --> 50:23.920
Yeah, sure.

50:23.920 --> 50:24.920
Sure, I have a Yahoo.

50:24.920 --> 50:26.920
This one was sent in by Postmaster.

50:26.920 --> 50:30.920
Those are Gmail names, probably not the general.

50:30.920 --> 50:31.920
Thanks, Postmaster.

50:31.920 --> 50:36.920
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Mr. Candy, who asks,

50:36.920 --> 50:39.920
prior to a date, what's on your checklist?

50:39.920 --> 50:41.920
Oh, God.

50:41.920 --> 50:44.920
Well, last time I was on a date, the Pope was Polish,

50:44.920 --> 50:45.920
but usually this is how I start.

50:45.920 --> 50:47.920
Why don't you leave the jokes to us?

50:47.920 --> 50:51.920
I know that you didn't know that your Yahoo answer was going to be on the podcast.

50:51.920 --> 50:52.920
You should have assumed.

50:52.920 --> 50:53.920
You should have probably just assumed.

50:53.920 --> 50:56.920
Physically, this is his checklist.

50:56.920 --> 51:01.920
Physically, wash car, inside out in full gas tank.

51:01.920 --> 51:04.920
This guy's like a doomsday prepper.

51:04.920 --> 51:07.920
Eat a big sandwich because when I'm nervous, I get hungry.

51:07.920 --> 51:09.920
Excuse me?

51:09.920 --> 51:10.920
Sorry?

51:10.920 --> 51:11.920
You lost me already.

51:11.920 --> 51:12.920
Say it one more time.

51:12.920 --> 51:17.920
After finished detailing the inside of his car and filling up the gas tank,

51:17.920 --> 51:22.920
eat a big sandwich because when I'm nervous, I get hungry.

51:22.920 --> 51:24.920
Wait, what?

51:24.920 --> 51:27.920
And to avoid eating like a pig in front of the date.

51:27.920 --> 51:29.920
Shouldn't it be when this person's hungry, they get nervous,

51:29.920 --> 51:34.920
and that would be the thing they worry about?

51:34.920 --> 51:35.920
Personal hygiene.

51:35.920 --> 51:37.920
I just picture them just slamming a footlong sub

51:37.920 --> 51:39.920
and then checking it off a list.

51:39.920 --> 51:40.920
Oh, shit.

51:40.920 --> 51:41.920
I got crumbs in my car.

51:41.920 --> 51:43.920
Got to go back to step one.

51:43.920 --> 51:49.920
He's really in touch with his body because he's nervous about getting hungry

51:49.920 --> 51:51.920
because he gets hungry when he's nervous.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.920
That seems endlessly sort of cyclical to me.

51:53.920 --> 51:56.920
This is a very fat man.

51:56.920 --> 52:00.920
Maybe when he eats a sandwich, he's like George Clooney.

52:00.920 --> 52:02.920
He turns into the smoothest dude ever.

52:02.920 --> 52:04.920
I hope it's not a spicy sandwich though.

52:04.920 --> 52:06.920
Oh, but then he gets that moment where he's sitting at dinner

52:06.920 --> 52:07.920
and you're just here like...

52:07.920 --> 52:08.920
I hope it's...

52:08.920 --> 52:09.920
I've got to go.

52:09.920 --> 52:11.920
I hope he didn't eat a spicy sandwich though

52:11.920 --> 52:15.920
because then he will be a very not nervous car.

52:15.920 --> 52:16.920
Detail myself.

52:16.920 --> 52:17.920
Third...

52:17.920 --> 52:21.920
Third transformative car.

52:21.920 --> 52:25.920
The third item on the checklist, which again, for context sake,

52:25.920 --> 52:29.920
has clocked in below detailing the car and filling the gas tank

52:29.920 --> 52:31.920
and then eating a big sandwich.

52:31.920 --> 52:35.920
Third, personal hygiene slash shower slash floss teeth, et cetera.

52:35.920 --> 52:38.920
So that one, I guess it makes sense you want to brush your teeth

52:38.920 --> 52:41.920
after you fucking eat a big sandwich.

52:41.920 --> 52:45.920
Washed and pressed clothing slash polished shoes.

52:45.920 --> 52:46.920
Makes sense.

52:46.920 --> 52:50.920
Carry a handkerchief in case we sit by a fountain, bench, et cetera,

52:50.920 --> 52:53.920
and wipe excess water or humidity, et cetera.

52:53.920 --> 52:54.920
Wow.

52:54.920 --> 52:57.920
Turn phone on silent mode.

52:57.920 --> 52:59.920
That one's probably all right.

52:59.920 --> 53:00.920
Okay.

53:00.920 --> 53:02.920
Maybe you want to turn it on airplane, just go the extra mile

53:02.920 --> 53:07.920
in case you get like, I don't know, Snapchat.

53:07.920 --> 53:09.920
This is okay.

53:09.920 --> 53:12.920
Those are just the physical notes, the mental notes.

53:12.920 --> 53:13.920
Okay.

53:13.920 --> 53:16.920
Include action items like don't use bad language.

53:16.920 --> 53:17.920
Don't stare at her boobs.

53:17.920 --> 53:18.920
Yep.

53:18.920 --> 53:20.920
That's a physical, sir.

53:20.920 --> 53:22.920
I guess that's true.

53:22.920 --> 53:23.920
Listen rather than talk.

53:23.920 --> 53:25.920
Don't think about staring at her boobs.

53:25.920 --> 53:26.920
Check.

53:26.920 --> 53:27.920
Listen rather than talk.

53:27.920 --> 53:30.920
Try to be funny but not too much.

53:30.920 --> 53:34.920
If anything annoys you, act cool and get pissed later at home.

53:34.920 --> 53:35.920
God damn it.

53:35.920 --> 53:37.920
Can't believe that.

53:37.920 --> 53:38.920
Fuck.

53:38.920 --> 53:39.920
Stay away from alcohol.

53:39.920 --> 53:43.920
One can look like a fool or something inappropriate could slip one's mouth.

53:43.920 --> 53:45.920
Safety if driving her home.

53:45.920 --> 53:47.920
I guess there's some pretty good arguments there.

53:47.920 --> 53:51.920
Well, and yeah, and apparently this guy is always one synapse fire away

53:51.920 --> 53:53.920
from staring at her breasts.

53:53.920 --> 53:55.920
So yeah, maybe avoid the sauce.

53:55.920 --> 53:59.920
Wait, in all of this, in all of these, some of them very down to earth things,

53:59.920 --> 54:02.920
can we remember that this is big sandwich guy?

54:02.920 --> 54:08.920
I just want to keep that in the forethought of your mind that this is the guy afraid

54:08.920 --> 54:12.920
he won't be able to resist eating a big sandwich.

54:12.920 --> 54:14.920
Never ever look at another woman.

54:14.920 --> 54:15.920
Whoa.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.920
Eyes on the sandwich, bub.

54:17.920 --> 54:21.920
My sandwich is down here.

54:21.920 --> 54:26.920
Hey, Jared, why don't you slow those peepers a bit?

54:26.920 --> 54:30.920
Step 10, bring big pants to show her how fat I used to be.

54:30.920 --> 54:35.920
Big pants will come in handy if transformed into car.

54:35.920 --> 54:37.920
Don't want to be naked, car.

54:37.920 --> 54:39.920
Step 11, cover your car, dick.

54:39.920 --> 54:42.920
Don't smoke near her or at all if she doesn't smoke.

54:42.920 --> 54:43.920
Yep.

54:43.920 --> 54:44.920
Have a backup plan.

54:44.920 --> 54:47.920
Two choices for food and entertainment venues.

54:47.920 --> 54:49.920
Own a copy of the movie, the backup plan.

54:49.920 --> 54:51.920
Finally, backup cash in case of emergency.

54:51.920 --> 54:53.920
I'm telling you this dude is a doomsday prepper.

54:53.920 --> 54:57.920
I'm telling you this guy is a bunker that he built himself.

54:57.920 --> 55:00.920
This guy has an ax that turns into a chair.

55:00.920 --> 55:02.920
Here's the thing.

55:02.920 --> 55:08.920
If you just, like, change the context of all of this, there's nothing weird about it.

55:08.920 --> 55:11.920
A dude being like, hey, here's some advice if you're going on a big date.

55:11.920 --> 55:16.920
But there's something about saying, like, I have a checklist that makes it crazy.

55:16.920 --> 55:21.920
No, the problem I have with this gentleman is that a large majority of his checklist

55:21.920 --> 55:25.920
should just be applicable to, like, being a person in the world.

55:25.920 --> 55:30.920
Like, why do you have to remind yourself not to be the worst, the pit?

55:30.920 --> 55:32.920
Don't look at another woman ever.

55:32.920 --> 55:34.920
You never know what you'll do.

55:34.920 --> 55:35.920
Yeah.

55:35.920 --> 55:36.920
Maybe it's a Medusa.

55:36.920 --> 55:37.920
Oh, no.

55:37.920 --> 55:38.920
You're stone.

55:38.920 --> 55:42.920
Man, there's – but there's, like – don't cut this guy too much slack because there's,

55:42.920 --> 55:44.920
like, three pretty crazy things on here.

55:44.920 --> 55:45.920
The fact that he fills –

55:45.920 --> 55:46.920
I mean, he's the sandwich guy.

55:46.920 --> 55:48.920
The fact that – you guys pointed out sandwich.

55:48.920 --> 55:54.920
The fact that he fills his fucking gas tank before he goes on any date ever is, like,

55:54.920 --> 55:55.920
crazy to me.

55:55.920 --> 55:59.920
Wouldn't you just know how much gas you have in your car, and if you're close to empty,

55:59.920 --> 56:00.920
you fill it up?

56:00.920 --> 56:05.920
Also, there's a very specific checklist there where his gas gauge is broken.

56:05.920 --> 56:11.920
Plus, his favorite sandwich store is three hours away.

56:11.920 --> 56:12.920
I have to go.

56:12.920 --> 56:14.920
I'll be back in six hours.

56:14.920 --> 56:15.920
I'm very nervous.

56:15.920 --> 56:19.920
Have you – you guys have been on dates, right?

56:19.920 --> 56:21.920
Yes, to my knowledge, yeah.

56:21.920 --> 56:28.920
I know it's been a while, you old merry creeps, but have you ever had a backup plan?

56:28.920 --> 56:31.920
Like, what if Shonis is full?

56:31.920 --> 56:33.920
I didn't even think about that.

56:33.920 --> 56:35.920
Is there still a Ponderosa's open?

56:35.920 --> 56:38.920
You show up to Shonis, and there's an hour wait, and you're like, God damn it, I should

56:38.920 --> 56:40.920
have planned something else.

56:40.920 --> 56:43.920
That never – that never happens, right?

56:43.920 --> 56:46.920
Well, and then you get really mad about it, and you fly off the handle right there in

56:46.920 --> 56:47.920
the Shonis waiting area.

56:47.920 --> 56:48.920
No.

56:48.920 --> 56:49.920
No, you don't.

56:49.920 --> 56:51.920
You bottle that shit up, and you take it home.

56:51.920 --> 56:52.920
You get angry at home.

56:52.920 --> 56:53.920
You punch a wall.

56:53.920 --> 56:54.920
Fuck damn Shonis.

56:54.920 --> 56:55.920
Fuck.

56:55.920 --> 56:56.920
I need a drink.

56:56.920 --> 56:57.920
Damn you, Shoni Bear.

56:57.920 --> 56:58.920
God damn Shoni.

56:58.920 --> 57:04.920
I'm also sort of uncomfortable with the idea of this gentleman as like sort of the date

57:04.920 --> 57:06.920
tour guide.

57:06.920 --> 57:13.920
Like, it matters very little what the lady in the situation wants to do on said date,

57:13.920 --> 57:17.920
because he's got a full itinerary with backup plans and contingencies.

57:17.920 --> 57:21.920
Also, this is a conversation this person has on every date.

57:21.920 --> 57:22.920
What's – is your food not good?

57:22.920 --> 57:23.920
You haven't touched it at all.

57:23.920 --> 57:26.920
Oh, no, I ate a big sandwich before we came here.

57:26.920 --> 57:27.920
Oh, cool.

57:27.920 --> 57:29.920
You're a crazy person.

57:29.920 --> 57:31.920
You know we were going to dinner, right?

57:31.920 --> 57:34.920
You knew we were going to dinner at a nice place.

57:34.920 --> 57:38.920
And if this person like gets married, is this applicable for every – this person's

57:38.920 --> 57:39.920
been married for six years.

57:39.920 --> 57:40.920
He's a very sweet husband.

57:40.920 --> 57:43.920
He takes his – he has date night twice a week.

57:43.920 --> 57:45.920
That means he fills up his gas tank twice a week.

57:45.920 --> 57:49.920
He goes to like this big expensive French bistro that he had to get reservations for

57:49.920 --> 57:51.920
months in advance, and he shows up.

57:51.920 --> 57:52.920
It's like, again?

57:52.920 --> 57:53.920
You did it again, Donnie?

57:53.920 --> 57:56.920
You ate a sandwich again, Donnie, at home?

57:56.920 --> 57:57.920
Let me tell the count, though.

57:57.920 --> 57:59.920
Here's Donnie's problem.

57:59.920 --> 58:02.920
A, you're assuming he's taking her to a nice French bistro.

58:02.920 --> 58:05.920
Why not just like have some fucking saltines, Donnie?

58:05.920 --> 58:07.920
Why you got to slam jam a big sandwich?

58:07.920 --> 58:08.920
Yeah.

58:08.920 --> 58:11.920
I hope this does continue into his married life, because it'll make impromptu dates

58:11.920 --> 58:13.920
all the more fun.

58:13.920 --> 58:16.920
Yeah, if this is like a surprise – are surprise dates a thing?

58:16.920 --> 58:20.920
Because this person would just collapse under the pressure, I feel like.

58:20.920 --> 58:23.920
I would be willing to bet that all of Donnie's dates are surprise dates.

58:23.920 --> 58:24.920
Oh, no.

58:24.920 --> 58:28.920
Oh, boy.

58:28.920 --> 58:30.920
Do you want to do something this afternoon?

58:30.920 --> 58:32.920
I don't have time to get to the sandwich store.

58:32.920 --> 58:34.920
I can't.

58:34.920 --> 58:36.920
My gas tank's half empty.

58:36.920 --> 58:37.920
Hi.

58:37.920 --> 58:40.920
Hey, I'm America's Sweetheart Jennifer Lawrence.

58:40.920 --> 58:42.920
Donnie, I just met you at LAX.

58:42.920 --> 58:44.920
I think you're a cool-looking dude.

58:44.920 --> 58:46.920
I've got two and a half hours to kill.

58:46.920 --> 58:49.920
Let's go to Chili's to go and hang out, because I think we could have a real connection

58:49.920 --> 58:55.920
with you, and I could take you with me to Hollywood Boulevard, and we could live the

58:55.920 --> 58:56.920
rest of our lives out happy.

58:56.920 --> 58:57.920
What do you say, Donnie?

58:57.920 --> 58:59.920
I know that you have time to kill.

58:59.920 --> 59:01.920
What do you say?

59:01.920 --> 59:02.920
I don't know.

59:02.920 --> 59:05.920
I've got a half tank in the car back at home.

59:05.920 --> 59:08.920
I've already looked at two women since we've been talking.

59:08.920 --> 59:09.920
I've got a small sandwich.

59:09.920 --> 59:15.920
I had a small sandwich.

59:15.920 --> 59:16.920
Oh, shit.

59:16.920 --> 59:20.920
This has been our comedy advice show, my brother, my brother, me.

59:20.920 --> 59:22.920
We hope you've had a good time listening to it.

59:22.920 --> 59:24.920
Listen, don't be like Ed and Tim.

59:24.920 --> 59:26.920
Share the show with people you care about.

59:26.920 --> 59:27.920
I think they're going to share it.

59:27.920 --> 59:30.920
We've guilted them into sharing the episode.

59:30.920 --> 59:34.920
But you should be like Ed and Tim in that if you want to do a birthday message or some

59:34.920 --> 59:38.920
kind of shout out on our show in which you admit that you don't know anyone else that

59:38.920 --> 59:44.920
listens to our show, just go to MaximumFun.org forward slash Jumbotron, and they can set

59:44.920 --> 59:48.920
you up with everything there.

59:48.920 --> 59:54.920
Thank you to people tweeting about the show using the MBMBAM hashtag.

59:54.920 --> 59:59.920
We certainly appreciate when you guys do that.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.920
Let's see.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:08.920
We've got BombsFall, RapUncle, Vladimir, Alonzo Duralde calling us out on our lack of knowledge

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.920
about Grace Jones.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.920
Sounds about right.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.920
Sounds about right.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:12.920
She's great.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:18.920
She's just like in that one instance of the Pee Wee's Christmas Special, it's a bit weird.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:23.920
Maribeth, Joshua Cummings, Megan McCaffrey, Schmoozie, Kellen, Elsie.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:24.920
So many others.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.920
Thank you so much.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.920
I sure appreciate it.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:31.920
As long as we're passing out the thank yous, why don't I shoot one to John Roderick in

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.920
the Long Winters.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:36.920
For the use of our theme song, it's a departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:37.920
It's a terrific album.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.920
I'm sure a lot of you guys got that as Candle Nights stocking stuffers.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.920
Please note that for Candle Nights, you use like ladies stockings.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.920
Silk stockings.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.920
Ladies silk stockings.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.920
You can't get a lot in there, but you can get a CD or a jump drive.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.920
Kind of got away from it.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.920
Yeah, it's good.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:10.920
I'm on it.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.920

Don't drink.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.920
There's other drunk drivers out there.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.920
Don't drink.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:22.920
You might say something bad.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.920
You might look at another woman.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.920
You might turn into like a hot rod.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.920
You might.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.920
If it's a spicy drink, sure.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:29.920
They have those.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:30.920
You guys want that final Yahoo?

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.920
Yes, please.

Justin, what are you doing?

Strapping a chicken in my arm.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:24.920
Heard there's some plague out west, so I just wanted to kind of get out ahead of it.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:30.160
Justin, if you'd ever listened to our medical history podcast, Sawbones, where we talk about

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.640
everything from trepanation to bloodletting, you would know that that is a ridiculous idea

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.920
and it will never work.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.920
I haven't caught it.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:39.920
Sawbones?

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.920
Yes.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.920
We do it every Friday on the Maximum Fun Network and we record it together.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:47.920
Do you need a doctor or something?

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.920
Yes.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:03:11.920
I'm Justin McElroy.
