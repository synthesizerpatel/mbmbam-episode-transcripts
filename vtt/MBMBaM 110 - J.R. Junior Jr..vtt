00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.080
Hello, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

00:48.080 --> 00:52.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.200
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Ladies and gentlemen, we got brave fever

00:57.200 --> 01:00.880
here at my brother, my brother, and me. Every movie that comes out, every movie

01:00.880 --> 01:04.480
that reaches a certain box office gross and rotten tomatoes rating.

01:06.400 --> 01:12.480
Travis has seen the film. He won't stop talking about it. Travis, give us your review of Brave,

01:12.480 --> 01:17.120
the new hit from Disney's McDonald's Pixar's. I'm glad you asked, Justin. Let me break it

01:17.120 --> 01:22.880
down for you. So there's this red-haired girl, right? She's sick of being a girl because it sucks.

01:22.880 --> 01:29.200
In the context of the movie, I don't think that's in real life, but she's living in 10th century

01:29.200 --> 01:33.120
Scotland, so they want to burn her for being a woman. Good to be a dude back then. Yeah,

01:33.120 --> 01:36.160
it's so great. Everybody loved dudes. So they're like, oh, you're a girl,

01:36.160 --> 01:41.440
we're going to burn you, right? Because she's a witch, obviously. Because she's got red hair.

01:41.440 --> 01:46.400
And so then she throws it back in their faces and she's like, fine, then I'll be a witch.

01:46.400 --> 01:51.840
And so she turns her brothers into bears and then she rides a horse for a while.

01:51.840 --> 01:58.640
And then she's at the Stonehenge and she does some magic. And all of a sudden, Wally is there.

01:59.360 --> 02:01.120
And they're hanging out. Let me interrupt you.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.840
And they're trying to find Nemo, right? Can I interrupt you for a second, please?

02:06.480 --> 02:09.200
Yes. That's exactly right.

02:10.720 --> 02:16.160
I haven't seen the film, but I read the official review in the Christian Science Monitor,

02:16.160 --> 02:21.520
and that is word for word, witchcraft and bears. I did read the original script leak

02:21.520 --> 02:27.520
on coolnews.com and it was there. Isn't it kind of cool? This is the name of that website.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.160
This is perhaps cool. Hey, neato. neato.com.

02:30.160 --> 02:38.480
Take this in. As you've probably guessed, this is an advice show primarily. Not just advising you on

02:38.480 --> 02:43.520
which cinema that you should take in, although that's obviously an important role that we play

02:43.520 --> 02:49.600
here. It's one of our facets. Predominantly, we give advice on life's little road bumps.

02:49.600 --> 02:54.640
Life's little stumblers. Life's little polyps.

02:54.640 --> 02:58.560
Life's stumblers, too. Still stumbling. Life's little fiddly farts.

03:00.080 --> 03:05.600
Life's little sharting. People need advice after that kind of event.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.840
Hey, I'm a nail biter. Where's the closest door?

03:09.120 --> 03:11.200
I'm a nail biter. Along came Polly, everyone.

03:12.880 --> 03:18.400
Classic. Next up, Travis talks about some Indian food he had and now it's upsetting.

03:18.400 --> 03:23.680
Hey, you got a ferret? Fucking asshole. I'm a nail biter. I'm not proud of it,

03:23.680 --> 03:28.800
but it's true. I never do the deed in public, but it can still be embarrassing when people

03:28.800 --> 03:34.640
notice my nails. My girlfriend is also not so much a fan of this habit and is always

03:34.640 --> 03:39.760
encouraging me to stop. I am meeting her family next month and I want to have it under control

03:39.760 --> 03:45.520
before I meet them. How do I kill this habit that has had some 20 something years of reinforcement?

03:45.520 --> 03:52.320
That's from Nom Nom Nom in Denver. Are you eating them?

03:53.200 --> 03:59.440
Are you consuming your nails for power? Don't do that. It's a lot of empty calories.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.200
You have to cut your nails so that you can use them to clean your teeth.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.000
Didn't Gwen Stefani have to get her stomach pumped because she had like

04:08.560 --> 04:14.080
30 pounds of nails? Don't just fucking spread lies around.

04:14.080 --> 04:20.560
It was either nails or semen. She had 30 pounds of semen nails?

04:21.200 --> 04:25.040
She had 30 pounds of something in her stomach. It might have been semen or maybe nails,

04:25.040 --> 04:28.720
but maybe heroin. No doubt.

04:29.920 --> 04:34.160
What I've always heard that people do is like put like Tabasco sauce or like red pepper or

04:34.160 --> 04:37.920
something on your nails to stop them biting them. Can you imagine forgetting and going to like

04:37.920 --> 04:41.040
scratch an itch on your eye or something? Or jerk off your penis.

04:41.040 --> 04:45.120
And all of a sudden you have to kill yourself because your penis is on fire.

04:46.960 --> 04:53.760
I'm not a good, I'm perhaps not the best person to be advising this because I still occasionally do.

04:53.760 --> 04:57.440
I think the grand scope of habits, it's not that bad.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.960
As long as you keep your nails clean.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.880
You physically can't do that. That's physically impossible.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.320
I am actually constantly scraping from under my nails,

05:08.320 --> 05:10.880
usually with a pocket knife, which is horrifying for people.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

05:13.200 --> 05:20.320
You're filing and picking habits are awful because I know that that pocket knife isn't cauterized.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.120
It's so much germs up in there. You know it's so much germs.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.560
And you're just getting those in your mouth and you're eating them and swallowing them.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.840
And you're going to get polyps.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.040
That's a question. How do you stop?

05:35.040 --> 05:40.880
I have I have a counter suggestion. Okay. Rather than stopping, if your fear is people noticing

05:40.880 --> 05:46.400
them, come up with a story for why your nails look like that and tell them you're really into

05:46.400 --> 05:49.040
power sanding. Okay. Okay.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.000
Then you keep getting your nails too close to the belt sander.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.200
It happens to me all the time, guys. Sure.

05:55.840 --> 05:59.200
And then people think you're a noble carpenter.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.400
Are you saying the problem is not that he bites his nails in front of people?

06:02.400 --> 06:07.200
It's that he has unsightly nails. It's an image problem.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.960
So just go to the manicurist. Get them that could be okay.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.360
Let me hit you with this. Why don't you go to a manicurist?

06:13.920 --> 06:17.600
Go every week and have them just like get a great look.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.560
And then you'll think to yourself, like, I can't bite these nails.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.640
I paid so much for these. It has to be a really expensive manicure, by the way.

06:24.640 --> 06:28.000
Do you think that they make like edible press on nails?

06:28.000 --> 06:34.800
Like just nails? Like the hit SNL sketch corn chip nail tips?

06:34.800 --> 06:36.960
Is that what you're talking about right now? No, I wasn't.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.920
Oh, start putting some bugles on your fingers. Okay.

06:39.920 --> 06:43.600
If you put bugles on your fingers. How is that not a temporary fucking fix?

06:43.600 --> 06:45.680
Bugles ain't permanent. You gotta have a lot of fucking bugles.

06:45.680 --> 06:49.920
I wish bugles were permanent. I wish that instead of cartilage,

06:49.920 --> 06:51.840
I had bugle bone. I wish I had bugle bone.

06:51.840 --> 06:55.200
That's actually one of the curses that the red haired witch does in Brave.

06:55.200 --> 06:59.920
She gives somebody permanent bugles. The old boogie boogie bugle boots.

07:01.440 --> 07:07.440
From company B. I think that the main problem with bugle nails

07:07.440 --> 07:13.120
is that at the end of it, you will just have perfectly seasoned nails.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.920
Delightful and playful even in their piquant tastes.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.600
They have a Southwest flavor that you're sure to enjoy.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.960
You're going to have to fight the rest of the family off to get to these nails.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.120
Let me throw this out as a way to stop doing it.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.520
Here's my suggestion. Stop doing it.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.000
There's like cold turkey. Just don't do it anymore.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.080
That's good. Is this hypnosis? I've heard about this.

07:37.520 --> 07:41.520
What I'm saying like, what is there other like you could put super glue on your nails

07:41.520 --> 07:43.840
and make them taste really nasty, but like anything you do,

07:43.840 --> 07:46.800
it's going to be so remarkably unpleasant. This is just stop doing it.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.280
Being on a show with Dr. Drew, it's great.

07:49.280 --> 07:56.400
Dr. Drew, all of his shows about self-help. Put down the fucking sandwich.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.120
What if I wanted to quit heroin, Travis? What would you suggest?

07:59.120 --> 08:01.600
Just fucking stop it. Right. Just not doing it.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.280
You're better than that. Sure.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.680
Aren't you? Could have fooled me.

08:06.560 --> 08:11.840
Oh man. It's kind of like your tone of voice is a little more Hulk Hogan though.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.840
It's like having Hulk Hogan as my mentor.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.960
It swings from like tough love to like, I hate you love.

08:18.960 --> 08:19.840
Yeah. All right.

08:19.840 --> 08:23.440
They only have two settings. It's just a good thing that Travis doesn't

08:23.440 --> 08:27.440
have any bad habits because who would be around to remedy them if not himself?

08:28.800 --> 08:31.840
Sometimes I just like stare in the mirror and I'm just like, stop it.

08:31.840 --> 08:32.880
Yeah. But you're not-

08:32.880 --> 08:35.280
And I start crying. And you're not addressing anything because

08:35.280 --> 08:36.960
you're a perfect man. Yeah.

08:36.960 --> 08:39.440
You're trying to- Honestly, I'm worried I'm being too perfect.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.560
Like I fear that it alienates others. It does.

08:42.560 --> 08:46.080
If you're just worried about, if it's hurting your self-esteem that you can't

08:46.080 --> 08:51.920
quit this habit, think of all of the habits that you are simultaneously quitting.

08:51.920 --> 08:55.840
Like think of all the things that you're not doing in that moment that other people with

08:55.840 --> 08:58.960
addictions are definitely doing. Like you might be biting your nails,

08:58.960 --> 09:03.040
but at that exact moment you're not smoking. You're not whoring.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.560
30 pounds of nails in the tummy. That's-

09:06.560 --> 09:09.680
You're talking- That's, how is that? That's the worst.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.160
You know, that's what don't, you know, that's what don't speaks about.

09:12.160 --> 09:17.680
Don't speak, I'm busy eating fingernails.

09:17.680 --> 09:19.920
You know the sweet maraca solo in that song?

09:19.920 --> 09:21.920
It's not a maraca. It's not a maraca.

09:21.920 --> 09:22.560
It's a tummy.

09:24.320 --> 09:27.440
Her tummy has become hardened and gored like from all the nails.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.600
There's just little points poking out from the edges. Like, oh, don't mind that.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.800
Is it possible that you could start doing like an even worse habit?

09:36.800 --> 09:40.960
And then when your girlfriend's like, you need to stop firing your gun in the house.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.440
You can be like, well, I guess I could go back to biting my fingernails.

09:44.000 --> 09:44.320
Yeah.

09:44.880 --> 09:45.840
Yeah, do that.

09:45.840 --> 09:51.280
I like that. Make her be happy about this bad habit you have.

09:51.280 --> 09:55.120
Gwen Stefani had a baby. Can you imagine being in a stomach

09:55.120 --> 09:59.840
that also is adjacent to 30 pounds? It's like living with a giant pine cone in your house.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.360
She was eating fingernails for two.

10:02.960 --> 10:03.360
Sorry.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.400
You came out with a taste.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.440
That kid came out with fucking antlers.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.840
Poor Gwen.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.200
Poor, poor Gwen Stefani.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.360
Alternate suggestion, dip your nails in poison.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.640
That's like the pain box from Dune.

10:18.640 --> 10:24.880
Like you got to keep it ever present in your mind because poisonous nails are the mind killer.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.200
It's like a zero strike policy.

10:27.200 --> 10:27.680
Yeah, yeah.

10:27.680 --> 10:27.920
Right.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.200
Well, I guess you get the one strike.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.160
One strike, you're out.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.280
But then that's it. Yeah.

10:33.280 --> 10:38.800
Best beds are honestly just to cut them, cut them with nail clippers and then-

10:38.800 --> 10:40.400
Real funny, Justin.

10:41.120 --> 10:41.440
Sorry.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.080
Oh, bring in some more chuggles. Back up the chuggles.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.080
Boop, boop, boop.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.320
Just dump that load of chuggles right over here.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.360
What if you just cut them? Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. You didn't let me finish.

10:52.880 --> 10:56.880
You didn't let me finish. The scissors are pickles.

10:56.880 --> 11:00.480
Damn it.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.440
You really pulled out of that nosedive at the last second.

11:03.440 --> 11:04.560
Good work, Baloo the bear.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.560
He's the only trick pilot I could think of, you guys.

11:08.560 --> 11:09.360
How about a Yahoo?

11:10.160 --> 11:10.720
Yeah.

11:10.720 --> 11:11.200
Hold on.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.640
No, yeah, he is. Sully Sullenberg.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.720
Nah, fuck it. He is the only trick pilot.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.720
Yaz Cruz sent this one in. Thanks, Yaz.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.800
It's about Yahoo Answers user.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.680
An American asshole who asks,

11:23.680 --> 11:27.520
I don't know, Yahoo Answers needs to tighten up their naming policy.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.800
I don't want my kids seeing that.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.440
An American asshole asks,

11:32.160 --> 11:34.160
Are fat people easier to hunt?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.200
Like fat criminals when they do wrong and the cops are after them.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.880
But there's no context for why he needs to know this?

11:46.640 --> 11:48.160
Maybe he's trying to get his life in order,

11:48.160 --> 11:51.920
and he's trying to find like a bunch of good reasons to get real fit and healthy.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.560
He's like, I need to pick a scapegoat.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.560
Should I pick someone fat?

11:57.520 --> 11:58.480
And the answer is yes.

11:58.480 --> 12:01.680
You're saying that he should have fatter friends in case they get shipwrecked.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.240
No, fatter accomplices.

12:04.240 --> 12:04.960
Okay.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.880
Or it could also be like a General Zharov situation.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.880
We could be dealing with a most dangerous game,

12:10.880 --> 12:12.640
and then you do want fatty shipmates.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.840
You should always have fatty shipmates.

12:15.840 --> 12:16.400
They're good luck.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.920
That is to eat them?

12:17.920 --> 12:24.160
Um, well, I mean, there's a lot of different ways in which having a fatty shipmate could help.

12:24.880 --> 12:25.120
Right.

12:25.760 --> 12:28.400
Off the top of my head, eating them.

12:28.400 --> 12:28.720
Okay.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.480
If they die, flotation devices.

12:32.480 --> 12:32.720
Yeah.

12:34.640 --> 12:37.280
They're just, you know, usually they're in better spirits.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.240
Super fuckable.

12:39.200 --> 12:39.760
Oh, yeah.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.400
When the sea madness sets in.

12:43.360 --> 12:44.880
You're not going to run out of places.

12:44.880 --> 12:45.840
Let's just put it that way.

12:45.840 --> 12:46.880
Uh-huh.

12:46.880 --> 12:47.760
To put.

12:47.760 --> 12:50.000
Oh, to qualify.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.400
He means like the rolls and folds and what.

12:52.400 --> 12:56.240
Yeah, you're not going to run short on places to get ready.

12:56.880 --> 12:59.040
You'll find places they didn't know they had.

12:59.040 --> 12:59.540
No.

13:00.400 --> 13:05.600
Now, Griffin, when you picked this question, is this where you saw it going?

13:06.560 --> 13:08.080
I thought we might be able to make an argument.

13:09.200 --> 13:09.520
That they are.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.280
For why February will be harder than-

13:11.280 --> 13:16.080
You see in like fucking movies all the time when shit goes rough.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.840
Who's the first ones against the wall and or floor?

13:19.840 --> 13:20.640
The fats.

13:20.640 --> 13:26.560
And it's I feel like movies portray them and like they're so they can't run as fast as a skinny,

13:26.560 --> 13:29.840
which I don't even know if that's true because they got so much inertia, right?

13:32.320 --> 13:36.080
Yeah, they'll run into a mountainside and just go 10 or 12 feet deep.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.720
You're saying if you cut through all the Hollywood bullshit in Jurassic Park,

13:40.720 --> 13:44.080
Jeff Goldblum dead, Wayne Knight out of there.

13:44.080 --> 13:44.880
He's safe.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.480
Wayne Knight escapes.

13:46.480 --> 13:51.280
Wayne Knight floats away on a river of mud into freedom.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.000
While Jeff Goldblum walks in the breeze.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.880
A breeze catches him, pulls him into the Velociraptor.

13:56.880 --> 14:03.920
You know that he actually, Wayne Knight's character in Jurassic Park left the island,

14:03.920 --> 14:11.040
floated all the way to Manhattan, started a life as a living next to Jerry Seinfeld.

14:11.040 --> 14:14.960
Now they say to him the first day, they go and they knock on the door and he says,

14:16.240 --> 14:18.880
hello, last name for the person living here.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.560
And he says, well, I'm a new man.

14:21.440 --> 14:21.920
Newman.

14:22.800 --> 14:23.600
That's how he picked the name.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.480
It's a prequel.

14:25.040 --> 14:25.760
It's a prequel.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.360
Jurassic Park is a prequel.

14:27.360 --> 14:31.360
Can you explain to me how Space Jam fits in the Wayne-iverse?

14:31.360 --> 14:37.840
Where in Wayne-canon does Space Jam fit in?

14:37.840 --> 14:43.200
I don't want to give Wayne Knight a big head in telling him that there is an entire verse

14:43.840 --> 14:44.160
based around-

14:44.160 --> 14:47.200
Because if you did that, then his head would be in proportion to his body,

14:47.200 --> 14:48.080
which would just be-

14:48.080 --> 14:50.640
His sickening fucking body, Wayne Knight.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.000
Get it, lose some pounds.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.360
It's gross to look at you.

14:54.000 --> 14:54.720
I'm sorry.

14:55.440 --> 14:55.840
In Wayne-

14:55.840 --> 14:58.960
I'm sorry, a professional listener of our show, Wayne Knight.

14:58.960 --> 15:09.440
In Space Jam, Wayne Knight schools Michael Jordan, MJ, I call him, in How to Dunk.

15:10.720 --> 15:16.240
I was just Googling for more information about this, and the only YouTube clip I found that

15:16.240 --> 15:18.160
popped up is labeled this.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.040
I show you not.

15:19.040 --> 15:26.240
Michelle Jordan is having a Space Jam, dot WMV.

15:26.240 --> 15:30.080
Michelle Jordan is having a Space Jam.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.120
I'm not sure that-

15:31.120 --> 15:34.240
Yeah, guys, I was having a Space Jam last night.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.040
Oh, man.

15:35.840 --> 15:40.160
Do you buy into the split timeline, Wayne Knight-iverse theory, or-

15:40.160 --> 15:43.440
Well, there's the different canons.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.880
Because there's one in one reality, and there's another in another reality.

15:46.880 --> 15:52.160
Because there's one in one reality, he travels back in time after he dies at the end of Space Jam.

15:52.160 --> 15:52.800
And then there's-

15:52.800 --> 15:54.400
Oh, canon, that's the original canon.

15:54.400 --> 15:54.880
Uh-huh.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.280
And then there's the one where he goes on living his life as a-

15:58.480 --> 15:59.120
That's the-

15:59.120 --> 16:01.280
Whatever his profession was in Space Jam.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.640
That's the teacher canon.

16:02.640 --> 16:03.760
Professional jamologist.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.160
Professional jamology.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.440
I think fat people would not be easier to hunt.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.560
I think that if I had to-

16:10.560 --> 16:16.640
I think if I was a bloodthirsty jungle hunter, or maybe I was on the desert plains,

16:16.640 --> 16:22.720
and I was hunting a man, and I had to choose between a slim, good body and a fatty arbuckle,

16:24.160 --> 16:26.320
I think I would go slim, good body every time.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.680
There's no pride in it, you know?

16:28.800 --> 16:29.680
It's not a matter of-

16:30.640 --> 16:34.080
I'm thinking about the difficulty, kill or be killed rating,

16:34.080 --> 16:38.560
not how am I gonna feel after I skin and wear Wayne Knight, you know?

16:39.280 --> 16:40.320
You're gonna feel great.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.680
You're gonna have a loose, breathable fabric.

16:41.680 --> 16:44.240
Well, yeah, because his skin really breathes, you know?

16:44.240 --> 16:44.960
Yeah, it's gonna be-

16:44.960 --> 16:46.640
It's gonna be airy, light on your skin.

16:46.640 --> 16:47.280
It'll be nice.

16:47.280 --> 16:52.800
It'll be really nice to wear Wayne Knight.

16:52.800 --> 16:56.160
The other thing that aids fat people when they're being hunted

16:56.160 --> 16:59.120
is that you might see him at the beginning and think-

16:59.120 --> 17:00.160
It's like Hunger Games.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.320
You'll see him at the beginning of the hunt and think,

17:02.320 --> 17:03.360
oh, I'll come back for him.

17:05.360 --> 17:06.560
I'll fight him later.

17:06.560 --> 17:07.440
No danger there.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.480
So I think you might forget where you left him.

17:11.520 --> 17:12.560
I guess is what I'm saying.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.160
I think we should just not hunt.

17:14.160 --> 17:18.240
I'm gonna go out on a bold stance here and say we should not hunt people.

17:18.240 --> 17:18.960
That's a pretty-

17:19.680 --> 17:20.720
That's not a bad policy.

17:21.520 --> 17:24.720
I mean, it took me a lot of trial and error to come to you.

17:24.720 --> 17:27.040
I didn't just like wake up one morning and know it.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.240
So I'm just passing on to you guys my wealth of experience and say,

17:30.240 --> 17:31.840
listen, it's a mistake.

17:31.840 --> 17:32.960
Don't hunt people.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.040
Don't hunt people, except for Wayne Knight.

17:35.040 --> 17:40.480
Cause like, I have tried to get that dude on a health track to wellness.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.360
It's Griffin Macro.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.560
It's Griffin Macro's health track to wellness, the program.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.760
Travis, you were on that for a while.

17:47.760 --> 17:50.080
I was, I lost 163 pounds.

17:50.080 --> 17:55.520
Yeah, and I've been pursuing Wayne Knight to really get off his duff

17:55.520 --> 17:59.200
and do something for him, make himself feel good.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.560
Nothing is, just nothing is working.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.160
So I'm gonna need-

18:04.160 --> 18:05.440
If anyone knows Wayne Knight,

18:05.440 --> 18:07.360
could you put him in contact with Griffin, please?

18:07.360 --> 18:09.280
Or just fucking start hunting him down.

18:09.280 --> 18:15.920
Hard target, soft target, start with Wayne Knight.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.280
Speaking of the art of film, let's talk about Independent Film Channel.

18:19.280 --> 18:21.040
It's got a new show called Comedy Bang Bang.

18:21.040 --> 18:25.920
Comes on every Friday at 10 PM on the East Coast, 9 Central.

18:25.920 --> 18:29.520
It's an absurd half hour comedy show, but it only looks like a talk show.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.400
Don't be confused.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.280
It's comedy so nice, they banged it twice.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.680
They got amazing guests, biggest names in comedy.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.480
They got Reggie Watts, hosted by Scott Aukerman.

18:38.480 --> 18:41.120
It's based on the hit podcast,

18:41.120 --> 18:44.000
but it's a good version of something on the internet.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.080
Not like the TV show they made about stuff my dad said

18:48.080 --> 18:49.840
or things my dad tweeted.

18:49.840 --> 18:50.240
Thank you.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.720
It's a good version of that.

18:52.720 --> 18:55.680
My kids listen to this show, so if we can cut down on the cursing.

18:57.280 --> 19:01.440
So tune into that Friday, every Friday, 10 PM on YFC, Comedy Bang Bang.

19:02.800 --> 19:06.240
Hey, over the past few years, I've picked up quite a few stickers

19:06.240 --> 19:12.000
slash decals at various concerts, restaurants, bars, etc.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.520
My problem is I can't seem to find a perfect place to display my collection.

19:15.520 --> 19:19.520
I feel like I've outgrown putting them on my car, but I do like having them around.

19:20.160 --> 19:25.040
Where could I put them that won't seem too immature or douchebaggish?

19:25.040 --> 19:27.040
That's from Decal Dilemma in Florida.

19:28.880 --> 19:29.920
I have a good answer for this.

19:29.920 --> 19:30.420
Okay.

19:30.420 --> 19:39.140
So my boss and your boss, Chris Grant, he puts his stickers on his vacuum cleaner.

19:40.820 --> 19:44.580
It turns it into like a, it turns cleaning time into rock and roll time.

19:45.220 --> 19:47.540
Makes it fun for everybody.

19:47.540 --> 19:50.580
Got lots of pizzazz and you're excited about cleaning because it's got,

19:50.580 --> 19:52.500
like you got a fun vacuum cleaner.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.500
It's got lots of fun stickers on it.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.180
And it's not like it's a decoration.

19:56.180 --> 19:58.020
Nobody expects it to look cool.

19:58.020 --> 20:00.660
You just put stickers all over your vacuum cleaner.

20:01.780 --> 20:04.500
I have such a problem with this.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.340
I have a bunch of cool stickers.

20:06.340 --> 20:15.700
And like, I just don't, I think I'm just constantly thinking about an item that I own.

20:15.700 --> 20:16.900
It's resale value.

20:17.860 --> 20:25.380
Like anything, anything like a computer or a vacuum cleaner or an iPad or an automobile.

20:25.380 --> 20:28.340
I would never put a bumper sticker on a car.

20:28.340 --> 20:29.460
Would never do it.

20:29.460 --> 20:33.380
Because I feel like if I put it on there, that's like 15 to 2K.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.780
Can I tell you guys a little story?

20:35.780 --> 20:36.500
Yeah.

20:36.500 --> 20:40.900
I own a green foot locker, a green chest that I've had since I was 18.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.340
So I've had it for 10 years.

20:42.340 --> 20:45.460
Used to be a lot of porn and incense in that thing.

20:45.460 --> 20:46.100
All the porn.

20:46.740 --> 20:53.220
And because of the length of time I've had it and the permanence of stickers,

20:53.220 --> 20:57.140
that chest still proclaims my love for Jason Mraz.

20:57.140 --> 20:57.640
Yeah.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.140
Oh, nice.

20:59.140 --> 20:59.640
Yeah.

20:59.640 --> 21:08.100
So that's my main problem with stickers is because 19 year old Travis doesn't know jack shit about anything that's cool.

21:08.660 --> 21:12.900
And I don't want 28 year old Travis to have to deal with the repercussions.

21:12.900 --> 21:18.180
To be fair though, to be fair, he didn't have the beard back then.

21:18.180 --> 21:20.500
He was not nearly as crunchy as he is now.

21:21.460 --> 21:22.660
He's hyper crunchy.

21:22.660 --> 21:24.740
He's become just the crunchiest dude.

21:24.740 --> 21:28.980
You know there's a, you can throw that trunk in the river.

21:28.980 --> 21:29.940
You know that, right?

21:29.940 --> 21:32.900
No, it's still a good trunk and now it's a hair loom.

21:34.260 --> 21:35.860
I'm gonna give it to my kids.

21:35.860 --> 21:38.100
I don't think your kids are gonna want to inherit-

21:38.100 --> 21:40.420
Dad, Jason Mraz fucking sucks.

21:40.420 --> 21:43.140
We all, you've got an in excess-

21:43.140 --> 21:46.020
I'm 10 and I know he's jack shit bullshit.

21:46.020 --> 21:47.940
You've got an in excess sticker on here.

21:48.420 --> 21:50.020
You're 28, you're not 66.

21:50.020 --> 21:51.860
That I will say is the other sad thing.

21:51.860 --> 21:54.740
There's only one sticker on the chest.

21:54.740 --> 21:55.780
You are fucking kidding me.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.860
It's not like there's a huge collection of stickers.

21:57.860 --> 22:00.980
You put on a Jason Mraz sticker and we're like, done.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.860
No, I was like, oh, this will begin an art installation.

22:03.860 --> 22:06.420
This trunk is ready, ready to go.

22:07.700 --> 22:11.780
With all the artists I ever really love, I'm gonna add him to this trunk.

22:11.780 --> 22:13.860
And it turned out he did do exactly just that.

22:13.860 --> 22:16.180
I mean, he just never found anybody else he liked.

22:16.180 --> 22:18.980
There's no one ever as good as old JM.

22:19.620 --> 22:21.300
Mr. MRA, that's what I call him.

22:21.300 --> 22:24.260
I did like his first CD for whatever it's worth.

22:24.260 --> 22:24.660
I thought he had-

22:24.660 --> 22:27.460
Oh, his live at Java Joe stuff was brilliant.

22:27.460 --> 22:30.020
But then like, what the fuck was the rest of that shit?

22:30.020 --> 22:30.580
I like that one-

22:30.580 --> 22:31.140
Jason.

22:31.140 --> 22:32.020
I like that one song.

22:32.020 --> 22:32.500
It's like-

22:32.500 --> 22:38.580
You know the song I'm talking about?

22:38.580 --> 22:39.380
I do actually.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.700
The Dream Life of Mr. Rand McNally is the name of that song.

22:43.700 --> 22:44.660
I was a huge fan.

22:44.660 --> 22:50.260
Do you guys want to know the sad truth?

22:51.700 --> 22:53.700
With both him and Dave Matthews.

22:53.700 --> 22:56.660
I'd still hang out with him in a heart seat if I got the opportunity.

22:56.660 --> 22:59.460
Yeah, you guys could compare like fisherman's hats.

23:04.180 --> 23:06.180
Hey, those are some really nice Sanux.

23:06.180 --> 23:06.980
Where did you get those?

23:08.180 --> 23:08.980
Oh, on the internet.

23:09.620 --> 23:12.900
With your light gingham shirt, how many buttons down do you go?

23:12.900 --> 23:15.380
Because we're basically the trendsetters in this department.

23:20.980 --> 23:22.100
I did like his live CD.

23:22.740 --> 23:24.740
You fucking assholes.

23:25.460 --> 23:27.460
That was like mind control.

23:27.460 --> 23:28.900
They played it at the borders all the time.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.020
It was so fucking good.

23:30.020 --> 23:32.020
When I was working there, I played it 24 hours a day.

23:32.020 --> 23:33.780
I could probably do all the lyrics.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.500
Could you do like a scrapbook of stickers?

23:36.500 --> 23:40.740
I mean, that's sort of what scrapbooks are from what I understand.

23:40.740 --> 23:43.060
So that way like you can display your cool stickers.

23:43.060 --> 23:44.900
But that feels disingenuous, doesn't it?

23:44.900 --> 23:48.980
Like I have a sweet Max Fun sticker.

23:48.980 --> 23:53.620
I got Max Fun Con and I'm a huge Max Fun supporter.

23:54.180 --> 23:57.060
But I don't want to put it on my car because what if I want to sell my car?

23:57.060 --> 23:59.380
But I don't want to just put it in a book because then it's like,

23:59.940 --> 24:01.940
here's a book of stickers I'm ashamed of.

24:04.020 --> 24:07.940
That is worse because it's like I didn't want anything to happen to these stickers I have.

24:07.940 --> 24:10.900
Yeah, they're going to be worth something someday.

24:10.900 --> 24:12.820
Please tell me the conversation you're having.

24:12.820 --> 24:16.020
We're like, actually, did you want to check out a book of stickers?

24:17.460 --> 24:20.660
You know, I actually have a quick and convenient way to convey to you

24:20.660 --> 24:22.100
everything you need to know about me.

24:22.100 --> 24:24.900
If you want to know everything I'm into, we could talk about it.

24:24.900 --> 24:26.420
But that'd be too exasperating.

24:26.420 --> 24:26.980
God damn.

24:26.980 --> 24:28.180
You know what I'm thinking, though?

24:28.180 --> 24:30.900
Like, honestly, that's all Facebook is.

24:30.900 --> 24:34.100
It's just a digital version of like, do you want to sit down for a few hours

24:34.100 --> 24:35.700
and look at all the stickers I have?

24:35.700 --> 24:38.500
These are all my stickers, some pictures of me and my friends,

24:38.500 --> 24:41.300
and just some things I've written under a list that says things I like.

24:41.940 --> 24:43.860
Yeah, I'm pretty sure if you have a sticker collection,

24:43.860 --> 24:44.580
you're going to die alone.

24:45.700 --> 24:49.220
Travis, if you don't change your Facebook banner image

24:49.220 --> 24:52.900
to like some Jason Mraz album art before this episode gets published,

24:52.900 --> 24:54.180
I'll never forgive you.

24:55.140 --> 24:57.460
I'm going to send everybody your Facebook and make them look.

24:57.460 --> 25:00.580
Okay, could you do like, okay, let me throw this out.

25:00.580 --> 25:03.700
Because if your worry is like looking mature and adult,

25:03.700 --> 25:06.340
do a collage like you would on anything else,

25:06.340 --> 25:08.500
but like frame it under glass.

25:08.500 --> 25:09.940
See, that's what's fucked.

25:09.940 --> 25:11.460
I have so many posters.

25:12.020 --> 25:14.580
And I really like my posters.

25:14.580 --> 25:21.540
And they're just basically huge, rectangular, unsticky stickers, right?

25:21.540 --> 25:23.940
That are more expensive than stickers are usually.

25:23.940 --> 25:26.180
And you can't put them in a car because it would-

25:26.180 --> 25:29.220
Whoa, whoa, slow down, Brainstorm.

25:29.220 --> 25:32.580
Put the stickers on the posters on the back.

25:32.580 --> 25:34.660
And then it's like a hidden map.

25:34.660 --> 25:36.020
And you flip it over and someone goes,

25:36.020 --> 25:37.620
oh, he really liked Jason Mraz.

25:38.340 --> 25:39.540
Yeah, it's a map to your life.

25:41.380 --> 25:43.140
What am I going to do with these pogs though?

25:44.580 --> 25:45.780
That's the question.

25:45.780 --> 25:48.020
I've got all these Flintstones jelly jars.

25:49.620 --> 25:50.980
Where am I supposed to put these?

25:51.620 --> 25:55.300
I have two to three thousand snap bracelets.

25:56.820 --> 25:57.860
Got a whole room.

25:57.860 --> 25:58.260
Keep them.

25:58.260 --> 25:59.860
It used to be my sneaker snapper room,

25:59.860 --> 26:01.140
but I ate bait all them.

26:01.140 --> 26:03.780
Oh, you ate bait in your sneaker snappers?

26:03.780 --> 26:04.660
I ate bait in my sneaks.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.060
Nice thing about Beanie Babies,

26:09.060 --> 26:10.340
that value is never going to go down.

26:11.700 --> 26:14.660
I've got all of these pizza shaped discs left over

26:14.660 --> 26:17.140
from my Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sewer boat.

26:18.020 --> 26:19.860
Just the discs, I got rid of the boat.

26:19.860 --> 26:22.420
But I probably got 150 of them.

26:22.420 --> 26:23.300
Right, different years.

26:23.860 --> 26:24.580
The ones with like-

26:25.460 --> 26:26.660
If you come over to Travis's house,

26:26.660 --> 26:28.500
he's like coming to the pizza disc room

26:28.500 --> 26:32.660
and he's showing you the ones with small factory imperfections

26:32.660 --> 26:33.540
and that kind of thing.

26:33.540 --> 26:35.380
Basically, all I did was I just stabled them

26:35.380 --> 26:36.980
to the wall directly.

26:36.980 --> 26:39.220
Yeah, there's no furniture in the room.

26:39.220 --> 26:42.500
There's a body, but I don't ask about it.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.220
There are five people right now

26:45.220 --> 26:46.900
who just threw down their iPod

26:46.900 --> 26:48.260
and like ran into their attic.

26:48.260 --> 26:49.860
Like, where's my fucking pizza launcher?

26:51.060 --> 26:51.860
I'm going to go-

26:51.860 --> 26:52.740
Dad!

26:52.740 --> 26:53.240
Dad!

26:54.020 --> 26:54.520
Dad!

26:55.220 --> 26:56.100
You promised!

26:56.100 --> 26:58.020
You said that if I kept up my GPA

26:58.020 --> 27:00.820
that you wouldn't throw away my pizza launcher!

27:00.820 --> 27:02.820
What do you mean I'm 32?

27:02.820 --> 27:04.820
What do you mean you died seven years ago?

27:04.820 --> 27:06.820
Dad, how long have I been asleep?

27:08.340 --> 27:08.840
Dad!

27:09.540 --> 27:10.040
I think-

27:10.040 --> 27:10.540
Dad!

27:10.540 --> 27:12.540
I think that old man was a genie!

27:14.180 --> 27:16.180
Dad, I think I got a genie curse!

27:17.860 --> 27:18.360
Dad!

27:18.660 --> 27:20.180
I heard Schwartz and I was on TV

27:20.180 --> 27:21.700
and he says he's governor!

27:21.700 --> 27:22.980
What's going on?

27:22.980 --> 27:23.480
Dad!

27:23.480 --> 27:25.480
I used to be Zac Efron and now I'm a genie!

27:25.480 --> 27:27.480
Zac Efron and now I'm Steve Buscemi!

27:28.280 --> 27:28.780
Help me!

27:29.740 --> 27:30.240
Dad!

27:33.140 --> 27:35.860
I've got adult balls and no pizza launcher!

27:35.860 --> 27:36.580
What gives?

27:39.620 --> 27:41.860
Dad, I wanted my suit to fit over the counter!

27:42.500 --> 27:43.380
What's going on?

27:44.660 --> 27:46.580
They said I couldn't at the store!

27:49.380 --> 27:50.980
Is that a problem you would like to-

27:50.980 --> 27:55.220
I can't find Jost on the shelves!

27:55.220 --> 27:55.720
Dad!

27:59.540 --> 28:00.040
Do you want a Yahoo-

28:00.040 --> 28:00.540
Hit me!

28:00.540 --> 28:01.040
Yeah?

28:01.040 --> 28:01.540
Yeah, hit me!

28:02.340 --> 28:04.260
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Emily Wall.

28:04.260 --> 28:04.820
Thank you, Emily.

28:04.820 --> 28:08.420
It's by Yahoo Answers user Nagini Potter who asks,

28:09.780 --> 28:12.740
Could I use a water gun instead of a neti pot?

28:14.100 --> 28:15.540
This is an awkward question,

28:15.540 --> 28:16.900
but I've broken my neti pot

28:16.900 --> 28:18.660
and I'd like to clear out my nasal passages

28:18.660 --> 28:23.700
before I leave in a little while or I'll be uncomfortably congested for the rest of the day.

28:23.700 --> 28:26.740
I've got at my disposal a little toy water gun

28:26.740 --> 28:29.540
and I've seen people use a squeeze bottle version of the neti pot.

28:29.540 --> 28:32.580
Would it be an efficient temporary replacement for my neti pot?

28:34.500 --> 28:41.060
Only if it is a Super Soaker brand square gun and it blows your mind out of your ear.

28:41.060 --> 28:43.620
I think it's got to be a certain caliber of Super Soaker too.

28:43.620 --> 28:45.540
I think a 50 is not going to get you there.

28:45.540 --> 28:46.740
Oh, you're going to need the 120.

28:46.740 --> 28:48.980
I think 120 to 150 at the minimum.

28:48.980 --> 28:49.940
You think 150?

28:49.940 --> 28:50.740
That might be a little pushy.

28:50.740 --> 28:54.900
I think you fucking get the one with the backpack in it and just like, never.

28:54.900 --> 28:55.940
Griffin, you crazy bitch.

28:55.940 --> 28:57.380
I know, I know.

28:57.380 --> 29:03.540
I, Griffin, I know that you're going to, you're going to, uh, you're going to rebuke me here.

29:03.540 --> 29:04.020
Okay.

29:04.020 --> 29:05.460
Because the neti pot's dangerous.

29:05.460 --> 29:06.340
It's not, two people-

29:06.340 --> 29:07.940
It is, it's full of bacteria.

29:07.940 --> 29:12.660
It's not full of bacteria, two people have died from using it.

29:12.660 --> 29:15.700
How many people have to die before people stop pouring water in their face?

29:15.700 --> 29:16.740
Some people need it.

29:16.740 --> 29:18.820
Don't put that, the hole is not for that.

29:18.820 --> 29:22.020
God is looking down at you and saying like, that's not the hole, Griffin.

29:23.060 --> 29:24.580
I told you where the hole was.

29:24.580 --> 29:25.140
It's your mouth.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.260
It's your singing hole.

29:26.260 --> 29:28.420
I just want to be there when some scientists say,

29:28.420 --> 29:30.580
hey guys, you know what always makes me feel better?

29:30.580 --> 29:31.540
Drowning.

29:31.540 --> 29:35.060
Let's see if we can't put that in some kind of home version

29:35.060 --> 29:37.620
that people can feel like they're drowning all the time.

29:37.620 --> 29:39.460
Please just boil the water before you use it.

29:39.460 --> 29:41.460
Of course I boil, what do you think?

29:41.460 --> 29:45.700
I actually, I make a homeless man gargle it and then spit it into my nose.

29:46.340 --> 29:49.140
Now, Griffin, you did have your first neti experience, right?

29:49.140 --> 29:49.860
I did.

29:49.860 --> 29:50.580
This week?

29:50.580 --> 29:51.300
What did you think?

29:53.220 --> 29:54.180
I'll tell you what's rough.

29:55.060 --> 29:55.860
What?

29:55.860 --> 29:58.820
I don't know how the flaps and flanges in there work.

29:59.540 --> 30:00.100
I don't know-

30:00.100 --> 30:00.420
Right?

30:00.420 --> 30:04.980
I don't know how the valves, I don't know how to operate those particular waterworks.

30:04.980 --> 30:08.340
It's a real wake up call when you realize those two things are connected.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.100
Let's talk about my flange control.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.380
Here's the things I can do.

30:11.380 --> 30:14.660
I can open up my wiener to pee when it's time to go do that.

30:14.660 --> 30:18.260
When I put water in my mouth, I know how to use my tongue to push the water down my throat.

30:18.260 --> 30:25.380
What I do not know how to do yet is to open my nose to connect the two nostrils

30:25.940 --> 30:31.300
and to somehow seal that tunnel so that things go in one side and out the other side

30:31.300 --> 30:33.780
without ending up in my eyes or something.

30:34.340 --> 30:39.220
So wait, so did you pour the neti pot in your nose and it came out your wiener?

30:39.220 --> 30:40.020
Is that what you're saying?

30:40.020 --> 30:41.140
Where'd it come out?

30:41.140 --> 30:42.820
It came out like my mouth and stuff.

30:42.820 --> 30:43.780
It was, it was-

30:43.780 --> 30:44.180
What?

30:44.180 --> 30:45.780
You didn't get the flow going?

30:45.780 --> 30:46.020
Huh?

30:46.740 --> 30:47.140
That's when I-

30:47.140 --> 30:47.780
You didn't get it working?

30:47.780 --> 30:50.900
I got it working eventually, but it takes some, it takes some doing.

30:50.900 --> 30:53.620
It's not as effortless as they make it look like on TV.

30:54.260 --> 30:56.180
But once you get it going, it's pretty pleasurable, right?

30:56.180 --> 30:59.060
Once you get it going, oh my God, you guys.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.220
It's not pleasurable at all.

31:01.220 --> 31:03.220
But afterwards, but afterwards-

31:03.220 --> 31:04.260
Is it like drowning?

31:04.260 --> 31:08.900
No, it's, I mean, if you do it wrong, I guess, but if you do anything wrong, it's like drowning

31:08.900 --> 31:11.460
because you could slip in a pool and drown.

31:11.460 --> 31:12.420
Trav, have you neti'd?

31:12.420 --> 31:12.740
Have you done neti pot?

31:12.740 --> 31:14.340
No, I would never do that.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.340
Don't let your fear control you because it-

31:16.340 --> 31:17.460
No, it's not fear.

31:17.460 --> 31:18.260
I don't want to.

31:18.260 --> 31:18.740
Why not?

31:18.740 --> 31:19.940
I have no desire.

31:19.940 --> 31:20.180
You don't have fear.

31:20.180 --> 31:24.500
You probably haven't had these kinds of, these kinds of sinus problems that-

31:25.060 --> 31:25.220
Yeah.

31:26.180 --> 31:28.820
I'm on steroids right now for allergies.

31:28.820 --> 31:35.380
I have to take things to make my body and muscles stronger to fight the allergies.

31:35.380 --> 31:40.260
The allergies in Austin, the mold, it's like visible.

31:40.260 --> 31:41.380
You can see it.

31:41.380 --> 31:42.980
It comes and knocks on your door in the morning.

31:42.980 --> 31:43.940
It's like, hey, stop.

31:43.940 --> 31:45.140
Can I shove myself in you?

31:46.660 --> 31:48.020
Hey, do you mind if I cram?

31:48.740 --> 31:51.220
I say, oh no, get the pot, sweetie.

31:51.940 --> 31:52.740
Baby, get the hose.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.580
Do you feel better?

31:55.540 --> 31:57.140
I don't know that I'll ever feel better again.

31:57.940 --> 31:58.820
Thanks, Mold.

31:58.820 --> 31:59.540
Thanks, Mold.

31:59.540 --> 32:00.340
Thanks for nothing.

32:01.140 --> 32:02.580
I know it always makes me feel better.

32:02.580 --> 32:05.300
Um, money.

32:06.420 --> 32:07.700
That's very shallow, Justin.

32:19.940 --> 32:23.380
Do you think when the person who invented neti pot invented neti pot,

32:24.100 --> 32:25.940
they like for, I would say-

32:25.940 --> 32:27.060
They were trying to kill themselves?

32:27.060 --> 32:34.020
For 18 months or so when they were workshopping it, they tried to pitch it as nose douche.

32:34.020 --> 32:37.460
I can't get much traction with this.

32:37.460 --> 32:41.620
I've been in so many businesses trying to sell them the nose douche and no one will take it.

32:41.620 --> 32:46.340
They seem on board till we get to the name and then it's just like slam door.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.060
Slam door.

32:47.780 --> 32:51.540
What about, hey, if I change it to face cinema, is that better?

32:51.540 --> 32:57.060
Um, hey, big news.

32:57.060 --> 33:00.660
You guys remember, uh, uh, Stack Soap, right?

33:00.660 --> 33:03.700
Talked about, um, Griffin wrote a great song for them.

33:03.700 --> 33:06.580
Um, but you can now, I got mine this week.

33:06.580 --> 33:11.380
I know a lot of other NBNBA listeners have gotten theirs recently, but now you can buy it.

33:11.380 --> 33:15.700
If you missed out on the Kickstarter, you can go to, uh, Amazon and look up Stack Soap,

33:15.700 --> 33:17.060
uh, and get it with free shipping.

33:17.860 --> 33:18.100
That's fucking-

33:18.100 --> 33:19.300
You can just search for Stack Soap.

33:19.300 --> 33:21.060
That's so great.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.500
Or you just go to stacksoap.com.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.580
That's going to take you directly to Amazon.

33:25.300 --> 33:26.260
Um, but it's great.

33:26.260 --> 33:27.940
It's like 12 bucks for six bars.

33:27.940 --> 33:28.980
Uh, free shipping.

33:28.980 --> 33:30.580
Like that's, you can't beat that.

33:30.580 --> 33:33.060
It's soap that stacks in itself.

33:33.060 --> 33:38.260
So when you get down to just a sliver, then you put it up, uh, you put it in the new bar

33:38.260 --> 33:39.460
because it's got to divot.

33:39.460 --> 33:40.820
It's an endless cycle of soap.

33:40.820 --> 33:41.540
It's amazing.

33:41.540 --> 33:42.820
So go buy it, stacksoap.com.

33:42.820 --> 33:48.100
I, um, I got my stack soap in actually last week and it's, I don't know if it's sad or

33:48.100 --> 33:51.460
awesome that I haven't used it yet because I'm waiting for my current bar of soap to

33:51.460 --> 33:52.980
get down to the stupid sliver.

33:52.980 --> 33:57.540
And I, once I, once I make the exchange, it's going to be the best.

33:57.540 --> 33:58.340
It's going to be so-

33:58.340 --> 33:58.980
It really is.

33:58.980 --> 33:59.860
I get so excited.

33:59.860 --> 34:00.580
I am excited.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.620
Like when I shower-

34:01.620 --> 34:03.940
Once you go stack, you never go back.

34:03.940 --> 34:08.420
I have been lathering like a, like a fucking crazy person lately.

34:08.420 --> 34:13.220
Because I want to get this stupid shitty bar down to a point where I can, where I can stack

34:13.220 --> 34:14.100
it up, you know?

34:14.100 --> 34:17.060
My brother, My Brother Me is supported in part by Bing.

34:17.060 --> 34:21.460
It's got a new social search that will bring together all your favorite people from social

34:21.460 --> 34:25.620
networks like Facebook, Twitter, and into one place where you can exchange ideas.

34:25.620 --> 34:30.740
You can discover new things and it'll help you to do things together.

34:31.620 --> 34:35.540
Check it out at bing.com because Bing is for doing.

34:35.540 --> 34:36.260
It'll bring you together.

34:36.260 --> 34:38.660
You can come together and talk about My Brother, My Brother and Me.

34:38.660 --> 34:40.500
Say, hey, I heard this new podcast.

34:41.620 --> 34:46.500
I heard this old ass podcast, this old beat up podcast, but they talked about Bing and

34:46.500 --> 34:47.700
I knew it was fresh.

34:47.700 --> 34:48.900
It sounded fresh to me.

34:48.900 --> 34:49.860
It brought it all home.

34:50.820 --> 34:52.420
What if there was a site called Bong?

34:54.420 --> 34:55.380
You check out Bong?

34:55.380 --> 34:56.580
No, Bong is a weak shit.

34:56.580 --> 34:59.860
No, it's still a search engine, but it finds you exactly what you do not want.

35:02.340 --> 35:03.300
This is terrible.

35:04.020 --> 35:05.300
I heard it's for Jim Varney.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.660
It's just a picture of his casket.

35:06.660 --> 35:07.220
Like what?

35:07.220 --> 35:08.420
Bong.

35:08.420 --> 35:10.180
Bong is such a downer.

35:10.180 --> 35:11.300
It's not even that it's wrong.

35:11.300 --> 35:12.340
It's like morally wrong.

35:12.340 --> 35:13.620
Bong is for uh oh.

35:13.620 --> 35:15.460
Guys, it's Friday on the Independent Film Channel.

35:15.460 --> 35:18.180
It's Comedy Bang Bang airing at 10, 9 central.

35:18.180 --> 35:20.020
The guest this week is Michael Cera.

35:20.020 --> 35:21.220
Who?

35:21.220 --> 35:22.260
Michael Cera.

35:22.260 --> 35:25.460
It's America's America's Heartthrob.

35:25.460 --> 35:27.700
Did you not know who he was or was I just not loud enough?

35:27.700 --> 35:29.860
No, it's both.

35:29.860 --> 35:35.380
Michael Cera and Paul F. Tompkins is there.

35:35.380 --> 35:38.660
It sounds like you're yelling to your old wife in the other room.

35:38.660 --> 35:40.980
Honey, honey, come in.

35:40.980 --> 35:42.180
Honey, come in.

35:42.180 --> 35:43.620
Honey, come in.

35:44.260 --> 35:45.940
Comedy Bang Bang's on.

35:45.940 --> 35:47.540
Michael Cera's on TV.

35:47.540 --> 35:48.900
You love that Michael Cera.

35:48.900 --> 35:50.660
He was on Arrested Development.

35:50.660 --> 35:54.420
He's that little sliver of a boy from Arrested Development.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.540
He's a man.

35:55.540 --> 35:56.260
You loved him.

35:56.260 --> 35:59.060
He was in that show where he fought all the evil ex-guys.

35:59.060 --> 36:00.740
He's a fraction of a boy.

36:02.180 --> 36:02.820
You like him.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.100
He's non-threatening.

36:04.100 --> 36:06.740
He looks like a normal boy who's been whittled down.

36:09.780 --> 36:11.300
They need to find a larger boy.

36:11.300 --> 36:13.940
He looks like he would fit into another boy

36:13.940 --> 36:16.660
and then combine and be an infinite loop of boys.

36:18.580 --> 36:20.100
So what else is going on in the show?

36:22.420 --> 36:26.900
Well, in this week's episode, Reggie, the musical host,

36:26.900 --> 36:28.820
worries that product placement is taking over the show

36:28.820 --> 36:32.020
and Scott Ockerman gets warned about his future by the Cake Boss.

36:32.900 --> 36:33.540
Cake Boss.

36:33.540 --> 36:34.500
Cake Boss, everybody.

36:34.500 --> 36:37.060
That's this week's episode of Comedy Bang Bang.

36:37.060 --> 36:37.460
Check it out.

36:37.460 --> 36:38.740
IFC 10-9 Central.

36:38.740 --> 36:39.460
Lock it in.

36:39.460 --> 36:40.260
Hey, brothers.

36:40.260 --> 36:40.900
Hey, brothers.

36:40.900 --> 36:45.220
So I have a name that is somewhat gender neutral.

36:46.020 --> 36:49.140
It is used as a girl's name more frequently now,

36:49.140 --> 36:51.300
but was originally only a boy's name.

36:51.300 --> 36:53.460
My problem is that while I like my name,

36:53.460 --> 36:55.860
people often assume I am male before we meet.

36:56.420 --> 36:59.460
I also receive mail addressed to Mr.

36:59.460 --> 37:01.300
Perhaps I'm overreacting,

37:01.300 --> 37:05.060
but I'd like to avoid future gender mixups.

37:05.060 --> 37:05.780
Advice?

37:05.780 --> 37:07.700
That's from Secret Girl in Virginia.

37:07.700 --> 37:08.740
And that's from Mark.

37:08.740 --> 37:11.700
That's true.

37:11.700 --> 37:12.500
Well, Steven.

37:14.180 --> 37:15.220
Well, let's ask Griffin.

37:15.220 --> 37:17.140
Since you've got a girl's name,

37:17.140 --> 37:18.980
so what is it like to often be assumed that you're a girl?

37:18.980 --> 37:21.220
Go fuck yourself in the throat.

37:21.220 --> 37:23.940
No, but I'm just saying like every other Griffin is a girl, right?

37:23.940 --> 37:25.460
Like you're the only male Griffin.

37:25.460 --> 37:26.580
You're the only male Griffin.

37:26.580 --> 37:28.420
You're living your life as the only male Griffin.

37:29.140 --> 37:30.420
Looking for one other Griffin

37:30.420 --> 37:32.500
that you can help repopulate your species with.

37:35.380 --> 37:38.340
I think that's a great thing because I'm always excited

37:38.340 --> 37:41.140
when I think, like if it's a work situation, for example,

37:41.140 --> 37:43.060
and I think the person is a man,

37:43.060 --> 37:44.260
and then it turns out it's a woman,

37:44.260 --> 37:45.300
I get excited because it's like,

37:45.300 --> 37:46.580
oh, good, they'll be competent.

37:46.580 --> 37:48.660
They'll actually be able to do this thing.

37:49.220 --> 37:50.180
And they'll actually-

37:50.180 --> 37:52.100
I was worried that they would be dumb, but they're-

37:52.100 --> 37:53.540
I thought it would be dumb,

37:53.540 --> 37:55.060
but it turns out that they are a woman.

37:55.060 --> 37:56.420
So that is quite a relief for me.

37:56.420 --> 38:01.940
I think it's kind of a little bit of that secret power.

38:01.940 --> 38:04.180
Like when you know something, the other person doesn't, right?

38:04.180 --> 38:07.460
And you roll up and they had like addressed yourself as like Mr.

38:07.460 --> 38:10.340
And you instantly have a leg up on this person

38:10.340 --> 38:12.260
because it's like, oh no, actually I'm a girl.

38:12.260 --> 38:13.380
So now you're embarrassed.

38:13.380 --> 38:14.980
So now I'm running the meeting.

38:14.980 --> 38:17.620
Well, I don't think that

38:17.620 --> 38:19.220
just because the person assumed you're a man

38:19.220 --> 38:20.580
and it turns out you're a woman,

38:20.580 --> 38:23.700
that you automatically get to run the meetings.

38:23.700 --> 38:26.980
But I know that you haven't worked in a traditional business.

38:26.980 --> 38:30.260
No, this is, if you can weave a thick enough mystery,

38:30.980 --> 38:33.220
then you win the game of Clue.

38:33.220 --> 38:35.140
Oh, fuck, I was thinking about the game of Clue,

38:35.140 --> 38:38.180
not professional, not professional business settings.

38:38.180 --> 38:39.300
I do that all the time.

38:40.180 --> 38:41.380
Yeah, that's a big mix up.

38:42.980 --> 38:43.480
Stupid.

38:45.780 --> 38:48.580
Could you start addressing yourself as like Miss,

38:48.580 --> 38:49.460
whatever your name is?

38:50.340 --> 38:51.380
Why should, no.

38:51.380 --> 38:52.500
All the time, no?

38:52.500 --> 38:54.900
That's, you don't need a horse and pony shit.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.900
Why do you, why give a fuck, man?

38:56.900 --> 38:57.780
Yeah, wait a minute.

38:57.780 --> 38:59.620
Now I think about it, this isn't your concern.

38:59.620 --> 39:00.580
No, it's not.

39:00.580 --> 39:01.300
It's their problem.

39:01.300 --> 39:04.660
Yeah, you don't have to do jack shit.

39:04.660 --> 39:07.060
They're the ones that come out looking like, you know,

39:07.060 --> 39:10.260
they assumed and they made axes of themselves and me.

39:10.260 --> 39:10.900
That is a power.

39:10.900 --> 39:14.820
Now, I hated Travis's idea, but like with the Miss,

39:14.820 --> 39:16.020
but what about Lady?

39:16.980 --> 39:22.180
If somebody's like, a guy's name was Gaga Peterson.

39:22.740 --> 39:24.660
I don't know, I don't know much about him,

39:24.660 --> 39:26.180
but he's supposed to come in here for an interview.

39:26.180 --> 39:27.380
That's confusing.

39:27.380 --> 39:30.340
If it turns out it's Lady Gaga, oh my.

39:30.340 --> 39:32.420
Oh, I know, there's no question there.

39:33.380 --> 39:34.420
What about Duchess?

39:34.980 --> 39:38.580
Duchess, Duchess, Duchess Ralph.

39:38.580 --> 39:42.100
What about, I'm totally, and you guys know this about me,

39:42.100 --> 39:43.220
I'm totally gender blind.

39:43.220 --> 39:45.220
Like, it doesn't, it doesn't matter to me.

39:45.220 --> 39:45.780
So what if-

39:45.780 --> 39:46.820
He actually can't distinguish.

39:46.820 --> 39:51.140
What if your prefix was just hmm, well.

39:51.780 --> 39:52.280
Well.

39:54.020 --> 39:55.380
Your move, hotshot.

39:56.180 --> 39:57.220
That's not a good prefix.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.340
That's not like legally recognized.

39:58.340 --> 39:59.940
You think that's like too many words?

39:59.940 --> 40:01.300
Too many words, definitely.

40:01.300 --> 40:03.700
I think it's gotta be just a series of letters.

40:03.700 --> 40:05.460
I don't think you can make a sentence out of it.

40:05.460 --> 40:07.460
Your sentence, like your prefix can't be like,

40:08.180 --> 40:09.300
guess what gender I am?

40:09.300 --> 40:10.820
Cause you're probably wrong.

40:11.460 --> 40:15.540
What if it was just mm-hmm, Griffin McElroy.

40:17.940 --> 40:19.860
The one that always confuses me is, uh,

40:20.900 --> 40:23.860
Mr. MSSR, what's that mean?

40:25.540 --> 40:27.700
You don't really give me Mr. Mr.

40:27.700 --> 40:28.500
I love that band.

40:28.500 --> 40:31.540
And I think that that's two wrongs don't make a right though.

40:31.540 --> 40:32.740
And that means feminine.

40:32.740 --> 40:34.820
What if, what if your name is DR Hughley

40:34.820 --> 40:36.340
and you become a doctor, right guys?

40:39.140 --> 40:40.580
Did you also mean DL?

40:42.420 --> 40:43.220
No, he's brother.

40:43.220 --> 40:46.260
He's lesser known medical brother, DR.

40:46.260 --> 40:48.180
Oh, of course he's a brother, Travis.

40:48.180 --> 40:49.140
God damn it.

40:49.140 --> 40:51.460
Can you get through one show without being a wicked racist?

40:51.460 --> 40:53.460
What if your name is Jr Jr?

40:53.460 --> 40:58.740
I made myself laugh at that.

41:00.340 --> 41:01.700
I'm Jr Jr Jr.

41:03.300 --> 41:04.660
What if your name is Carl's Jr

41:04.660 --> 41:05.780
and get a job at Carl's Jr?

41:07.300 --> 41:09.140
What if you're in the band Jr Sr

41:09.140 --> 41:11.460
and you're somebody's dad and son with the same name.

41:12.180 --> 41:13.300
Simultaneously.

41:14.180 --> 41:16.260
And you're also a medical doctor and a lawyer

41:16.260 --> 41:17.220
and a senior in high school.

41:17.940 --> 41:18.340
Fuck.

41:18.340 --> 41:19.540
So wait, hold on.

41:19.540 --> 41:22.020
Now, Justin, what prefix do you get for being a lawyer?

41:22.020 --> 41:24.180
You get a suffix, Esquire.

41:24.660 --> 41:25.380
Oh, okay.

41:25.380 --> 41:30.580
So I'm, I'm, I'm high school, high school senior.

41:30.580 --> 41:36.580
Jr Jr Jr for the band Jr Sr and my dad shares the same name,

41:36.580 --> 41:39.220
PhD, but I'm not a doctor.

41:39.220 --> 41:40.580
That's just a part of my name.

41:40.580 --> 41:41.940
It's a dangling modifier.

41:42.740 --> 41:46.100
It's pronounced Jr Jr Jr senior.

41:48.180 --> 41:50.100
Shake your coconuts.

41:50.100 --> 41:53.780
Oh, golly.

41:53.780 --> 41:57.300
I am taking my first vacation in a year in early July.

41:57.300 --> 41:59.540
My new job is in upstate New York.

41:59.540 --> 42:01.780
I'll be spending three weeks visiting family and friends

42:01.780 --> 42:03.860
in Galveston and Austin, Texas, respectively.

42:04.900 --> 42:07.300
Before this year, I always took the existence of evenings

42:07.300 --> 42:09.540
and weekends to myself to be for granted.

42:09.540 --> 42:11.700
Always spent my vacation just lounging around,

42:11.700 --> 42:13.060
eating my parents' food.

42:13.060 --> 42:15.220
But now that I don't just have a job,

42:15.220 --> 42:17.140
but actually live on the job,

42:17.140 --> 42:19.620
I'm afraid of wasting my precious,

42:19.620 --> 42:21.780
precious vacation time in front of the tube.

42:21.780 --> 42:23.700
How can I get the most out of my vacation

42:23.700 --> 42:26.100
and return to the relatively real world?

42:26.900 --> 42:27.620
Refreshed.

42:27.620 --> 42:29.220
That's from overworked in New York.

42:30.420 --> 42:31.300
Bunch of drugs.

42:31.300 --> 42:32.900
No, no, no, no.

42:32.900 --> 42:34.420
You really want that lost week.

42:34.420 --> 42:36.420
Just drug it out.

42:36.420 --> 42:39.620
Like a Jimmy Buffett song on a drunk.

42:39.620 --> 42:42.980
Like if you were Jimmy Buffett in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

42:42.980 --> 42:43.540
Right.

42:43.540 --> 42:47.620
Just trying to kill yourself on daiquiris.

42:47.620 --> 42:53.060
I think, honestly, the best thing you can do for vacation is...

42:53.060 --> 42:54.580
A lot of people like a busy vacation.

42:55.300 --> 42:59.940
Maybe if their day-to-day lives are pretty slow-paced.

42:59.940 --> 43:02.500
I think they like something with a lot of activity.

43:02.500 --> 43:05.300
I personally think that you should just try to counter-program.

43:05.300 --> 43:09.220
Like whatever you get an influx of in the workplace,

43:09.220 --> 43:12.660
then you should try to avoid that at all costs.

43:12.660 --> 43:15.460
It really helps to bring balance to your life.

43:15.460 --> 43:16.820
It's technology for me.

43:16.820 --> 43:20.020
I got to try to steer clear of it to have it relaxing.

43:20.020 --> 43:25.940
I'm usually fairly successful at that, but that's a key for me.

43:25.940 --> 43:29.540
I remember being a kid and we'd go on big family vacations and everything.

43:29.540 --> 43:34.020
At like nine and ten, all I wanted to do was everything all the time.

43:34.020 --> 43:35.620
So we'd get there and be like,

43:35.620 --> 43:36.740
let's go mini golfing.

43:36.740 --> 43:37.860
Let's go do laser tag.

43:37.860 --> 43:38.740
Let's go to the beach.

43:38.740 --> 43:39.860
Let's go see a movie.

43:39.860 --> 43:40.660
Let's go to the mall.

43:40.660 --> 43:42.500
And mom and dad would be like,

43:42.500 --> 43:43.780
can we just like not?

43:43.780 --> 43:47.540
Can we just like sit here on the porch and not do anything?

43:47.540 --> 43:49.540
Just go make a turkey sandwich for yourself.

43:49.540 --> 43:50.500
Get out of our sight.

43:50.500 --> 43:51.700
And I couldn't understand it.

43:51.700 --> 43:52.580
I was sitting there like,

43:52.580 --> 43:54.820
you're on vacation and we're not doing anything.

43:55.620 --> 43:58.340
And only now as an adult do I kind of sit there and go,

43:58.340 --> 44:01.380
man, there's nothing like knowing you've got nothing to do.

44:01.380 --> 44:03.780
I was the shittiest kid ever.

44:03.780 --> 44:05.860
I was just such a dickhead.

44:06.500 --> 44:07.780
Such a piece of shit.

44:07.780 --> 44:11.140
I'm glad mom and dad didn't just leave me at the beach.

44:11.140 --> 44:14.180
That's why I like going on vacations with my sister-in-law Riley.

44:14.180 --> 44:15.300
She's 11 years old.

44:15.300 --> 44:18.740
And if I get that, that little tickle in the back of my throat,

44:18.740 --> 44:19.940
that, you know, that, that youth,

44:19.940 --> 44:22.580
that, that young, that young spirit I still have,

44:22.580 --> 44:24.100
my, my wild oats, I think,

44:24.100 --> 44:25.860
hey, I'll make this kid do something with me.

44:25.860 --> 44:28.180
Hey kid, let's go play a game or something.

44:28.180 --> 44:30.420
But if the kid is like wanting to do something

44:30.420 --> 44:32.580
and I don't want to, I just put her in a closet.

44:32.580 --> 44:33.300
Yep.

44:33.300 --> 44:33.860
You're going to be the-

44:33.860 --> 44:34.660
Because they're compact.

44:34.660 --> 44:35.380
They're very small.

44:35.380 --> 44:36.580
They don't need a lot of room.

44:36.580 --> 44:39.060
Yeah, I'll put her in there with my rock and roll vacuum.

44:39.060 --> 44:41.460
You are going to be a superb father one day.

44:41.460 --> 44:41.860
Thank you.

44:41.860 --> 44:46.580
You are going to make one child very, very, very happy

44:46.580 --> 44:48.180
for like a few minutes at a time.

44:49.620 --> 44:53.300
Whenever is convenient for you, you will make that child so happy.

44:53.300 --> 44:55.700
I'm going to be the Cliff Huxtable of my state.

44:55.700 --> 44:56.420
Okay.

44:56.420 --> 44:58.180
I'm not, I don't get the reference.

44:58.180 --> 45:00.100
He's a Cosby, Cosby.

45:00.100 --> 45:01.620
He is a, he is a Cosby.

45:02.900 --> 45:04.820
He's one of those Cosby cosplayers.

45:04.820 --> 45:07.220
He's one of the permutations of Cosby.

45:07.220 --> 45:10.900
After Cosby's fourth regeneration, he was Cliff Huxtable.

45:10.900 --> 45:18.820
After he, after Littered Part 6 died, Cosby regenerated as Cliff Huxtable.

45:18.820 --> 45:21.780
Why did they call the show the Cosby Show, but he was not,

45:21.780 --> 45:23.860
the character was not named Cosby?

45:23.860 --> 45:24.900
I just had a problem with that.

45:24.900 --> 45:27.300
Like who are they trying to fool by changing his name, Cliff Huxtable?

45:27.300 --> 45:27.940
Well, in case they-

45:27.940 --> 45:28.900
Just make it Bill Cosby.

45:28.900 --> 45:29.780
Everybody knew what was up.

45:29.780 --> 45:33.140
They didn't know how many Cosby regenerations they were going to get through.

45:33.140 --> 45:33.780
Oh, I see.

45:33.780 --> 45:40.020
So they, the people were very, were crazy about the Cliff Huxtable regeneration

45:40.020 --> 45:44.660
and they were originally going to go ahead and do the Cosby regeneration

45:44.660 --> 45:47.300
from the Cosby Mysteries during that series.

45:47.300 --> 45:51.780
But people were so crazy about it that they couldn't ever, you know, switch over.

45:51.780 --> 45:54.820
And people were really confused at that time that Cosby regenerated

45:54.820 --> 45:57.940
and he was British and he had a bow tie.

45:57.940 --> 46:03.540
Do you remember when Theo died and they recast him as a robot dog?

46:03.540 --> 46:04.100
That was pretty weird.

46:04.100 --> 46:05.140
Yeah, that one was weird.

46:06.660 --> 46:06.900
Fuck.

46:06.900 --> 46:12.420
Do you guys, can anybody on this call tell me what the Cosby regeneration name was

46:12.420 --> 46:13.380
in the Cosby Mysteries?

46:13.380 --> 46:15.220
What the name of that regeneration was?

46:15.220 --> 46:16.900
Schmiff Schmuckstable.

46:16.900 --> 46:18.820
No, it's not Schmiff Schmuckstable.

46:18.820 --> 46:19.460
Very close.

46:19.460 --> 46:20.660
Ghost, Ghost Dad.

46:22.820 --> 46:24.180
Is actually Guy Hanks.

46:24.180 --> 46:24.420
Okay.

46:26.180 --> 46:27.220
It's not a good name.

46:27.220 --> 46:27.700
Not at all.

46:29.140 --> 46:32.340
I don't know what to, I haven't been on a, I'm going to, I think we want to,

46:32.340 --> 46:36.500
I'm going on vacation, going on a beach vacation this summer.

46:36.500 --> 46:36.980
And I feel like-

46:36.980 --> 46:37.700
Now where are you going?

46:37.700 --> 46:39.620
I made a pitch for Tybee Island.

46:39.620 --> 46:42.100
I'm going to hit up South Kikilati, baby.

46:43.140 --> 46:43.780
Now what is that?

46:43.780 --> 46:46.740
That is, that's what the people in South Carolina call it, South Carolina.

46:46.740 --> 46:48.260
I don't think any of them call it that.

46:48.260 --> 46:48.820
Okay.

46:48.820 --> 46:49.460
I think I saw that.

46:49.460 --> 46:50.340
You going to Savannah?

46:50.340 --> 46:51.700
Are you going to Savannah?

46:51.700 --> 46:54.340
Go fang yourself, drink some mint juleps.

46:54.340 --> 46:59.380
I actually can't say where I'm going because I don't want to be, uh, hunted down.

46:59.380 --> 47:00.020
Sure.

47:00.020 --> 47:02.740
By paparazzi.

47:02.740 --> 47:04.660
Trying to get the topless pics of you.

47:04.660 --> 47:07.060
Um, but yeah, I don't know.

47:07.060 --> 47:08.980
Like I haven't been on vacation.

47:08.980 --> 47:10.420
I don't know what my body is going to do.

47:10.980 --> 47:14.500
I don't know if it's going to be like, let's just lamp or is it going to be like,

47:14.500 --> 47:17.940
I want to see all the sites because you'll never get a chance to see these sites for a while.

47:17.940 --> 47:18.740
That's a good question.

47:18.740 --> 47:20.500
You gotta go someplace that's not very exciting.

47:20.500 --> 47:21.060
That's key.

47:22.260 --> 47:24.740
I'm going to take a week long vacation and just lay on my couch.

47:24.740 --> 47:25.140
Okay.

47:25.140 --> 47:26.020
That's a staycation.

47:27.060 --> 47:28.340
No, I don't want to call it that.

47:28.340 --> 47:31.060
I'm an adult.

47:31.060 --> 47:32.580
It's just called unemployment.

47:32.580 --> 47:33.220
Yeah.

47:33.220 --> 47:35.780
It's just called, Travis hasn't been at work this week.

47:35.780 --> 47:37.140
Has anyone noticed that?

47:37.140 --> 47:39.300
There's a strange smell coming from his bedroom.

47:40.020 --> 47:40.900
Travis is dead.

47:40.900 --> 47:42.100
I'm worried about that.

47:42.740 --> 47:43.780
You guys want a Yahoo answer?

47:44.580 --> 47:47.220
Yeah, I was trying to stall one out of you.

47:47.220 --> 47:50.500
Um, here comes a fresh Yahoo answer for you.

47:51.860 --> 47:57.140
Um, can you deliver that again with a bit more pizzazz?

47:57.140 --> 47:59.540
Here's a hot and ready Yahoo answer.

48:00.500 --> 48:04.660
Oh guys, there's some real, this one was sent by Secret Person.

48:04.660 --> 48:07.300
It's by Yahoo Answers user Desira who asks,

48:07.860 --> 48:10.740
I'm a peanut butter lava lamp with pretty little unicorns on it.

48:10.740 --> 48:11.780
What are you?

48:11.780 --> 48:13.380
Don't be afraid to be crazy.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.180
What the fuck?

48:16.180 --> 48:17.780
I'm dying.

48:17.780 --> 48:19.860
I need to get out of my skin.

48:19.860 --> 48:22.020
This is terrible in here all of a sudden.

48:22.020 --> 48:22.820
I'm puke.

48:22.820 --> 48:26.020
It's being boiled over and it's burned on the burner a little bit.

48:26.020 --> 48:30.500
Ali Capalzi says, I'm Arthur the aardvark with no horns and pink spots

48:30.500 --> 48:34.420
and a black and white stripey headband and an allergy to peanut butter lava lamps

48:34.420 --> 48:35.940
with pretty little unicorns on it.

48:35.940 --> 48:37.460
Smile, smile, smile, smile, smile.

48:37.460 --> 48:38.820
Stop it.

48:38.820 --> 48:39.320
What?

48:40.340 --> 48:43.940
I love you says, I'm a nerdy purple tiger with three tattoos.

48:43.940 --> 48:46.260
I just made that up cause I'm smart, my favorite color,

48:46.260 --> 48:48.260
my favorite animal, and I like trees.

48:49.460 --> 48:50.820
Oh God bless it.

48:50.820 --> 48:52.580
I'm spiraling into madness.

48:52.580 --> 48:52.820
So many people can't-

48:52.820 --> 48:56.180
The real podcast has continued on and this is just all I can hear.

48:56.180 --> 48:59.940
I'm a colorful dino that has superpowers, XPPPPP.

49:00.820 --> 49:02.820
No, no, you're not.

49:02.820 --> 49:04.740
You're a sad, sad person.

49:04.740 --> 49:06.740
I can just cut loose and be silly.

49:07.460 --> 49:09.300
A shoe being thrown at you.

49:13.380 --> 49:15.940
This is the yellow answers that Bong brings up.

49:18.180 --> 49:19.860
I'm a purple cheese ball.

49:19.860 --> 49:22.740
My face is a greeter that has a card on it.

49:22.740 --> 49:23.940
Come on, stupid lamp.

49:25.620 --> 49:29.780
I'm the swirling pit of sadness that stares you down in the face every day.

49:31.380 --> 49:34.580
I'm the unavoidable truth that your life is finite.

49:34.580 --> 49:36.740
Come climb in the tear pool, bitch shit.

49:36.740 --> 49:41.780
I'm the slow march of death dragging you ever onwards towards the grave.

49:41.780 --> 49:44.740
I'm the drugs your dad used when you were a little kid

49:44.740 --> 49:46.580
that made you the way that you are today.

49:46.580 --> 49:52.340
I don't know where you have to put a Cosby riff at the end of each one.

49:54.900 --> 49:55.860
Fuck that.

49:55.860 --> 49:56.980
Fuck that whole-

49:56.980 --> 49:58.340
That's not like a goof.

49:59.220 --> 50:00.980
That's not a fucking zinger.

50:00.980 --> 50:01.300
That's just-

50:01.300 --> 50:02.500
There's not even a setup.

50:02.500 --> 50:05.060
It's not even like pick your favorite color.

50:05.060 --> 50:09.380
It's just like string together a big long mishmash of nonsense where-

50:09.380 --> 50:10.740
I'm a bacon abortion.

50:12.340 --> 50:13.620
Now, are there any others?

50:13.620 --> 50:14.180
Because I do-

50:14.180 --> 50:16.180
My interest is beef.

50:16.180 --> 50:17.380
No, that's all.

50:17.380 --> 50:20.020
No, I mean, there's more, but I'm not gonna read anymore.

50:20.020 --> 50:23.780
I'm a mildly successful accountant with kids that don't respect him.

50:25.060 --> 50:25.860
Come on, Griffin.

50:25.860 --> 50:26.500
Give me more.

50:26.500 --> 50:27.540
I know there's more in there.

50:28.180 --> 50:31.780
I'm a reckless individual with four eyes, green hair, two left feet,

50:31.780 --> 50:33.860
an extra toe, and a severely big head.

50:34.500 --> 50:35.780
Okay, now he didn't get it.

50:36.500 --> 50:37.620
He didn't get the-

50:37.620 --> 50:39.540
He didn't get the purpose of this experiment.

50:39.540 --> 50:45.220
I'm Charles Manson's love child.

50:45.220 --> 50:45.780
Maybe this-

50:45.780 --> 50:46.340
Oh, guys.

50:47.300 --> 50:55.140
What if this is a brilliant government, like a sting operation,

50:55.940 --> 50:59.300
and all of these answers psychologically can be broken down

50:59.300 --> 51:01.380
to figure out who's a terrorist and who's not.

51:01.380 --> 51:02.580
Oh my God.

51:02.580 --> 51:02.980
Can I see-

51:02.980 --> 51:04.660
Uncle Sam's become so crafty.

51:04.660 --> 51:05.700
He can't tell-

51:05.700 --> 51:09.140
Like, he can't tell if I got bombs in my shoes, so I gotta take them off,

51:09.140 --> 51:14.260
but he can tell if these fuck heads are gonna try to attack a beloved American landmark.

51:14.260 --> 51:18.740
I'm a plaid triceratops with bubble gum coming out of my ears.

51:18.740 --> 51:19.380
Oh my God.

51:19.380 --> 51:19.940
Take him.

51:19.940 --> 51:20.580
Oh my God.

51:21.220 --> 51:26.420
This sounds like a fucking character creation sheet for Dungeons and Dragons in Fuck You.

51:28.260 --> 51:30.900
Um, here's a good Yahoo answer.

51:31.700 --> 51:34.020
Well, I suppose that's subjective.

51:36.180 --> 51:37.060
It's sent by Steven Lewis.

51:37.060 --> 51:37.540
Thank you, Steven.

51:37.540 --> 51:40.260
It's by Yahoo Answers user LilRedHead, who asks,

51:40.260 --> 51:42.660
I want my tattoo covered up with another tattoo.

51:43.620 --> 51:46.340
Okay, so I have a tat on the small of my back.

51:46.340 --> 51:50.980
It's one of my daughter's names, but I would like to cover it with another tat.

51:51.620 --> 51:52.660
The name is Jade.

51:53.220 --> 51:55.300
Any ideas of anything big to cover it?

51:55.300 --> 51:56.420
You don't have to be specific.

51:56.420 --> 51:58.900
Just a general idea of some things that may work.

51:58.900 --> 52:00.820
Thanks much, and a happy Friday, y'all.

52:01.940 --> 52:02.740
Additional details.

52:02.740 --> 52:04.340
I'm covering up my daughter's name,

52:04.340 --> 52:08.100
because I have gotten another tattoo with both of my daughter's names in it.

52:08.100 --> 52:10.660
So I don't see a point as to having her name twice,

52:10.660 --> 52:12.500
but my other girl only has one spot.

52:12.500 --> 52:13.780
I'm not a bad mother, Lil.

52:15.140 --> 52:18.820
Yeah, well, what about not Jade?

52:19.460 --> 52:20.100
That's pretty good.

52:20.100 --> 52:20.660
Okay.

52:20.660 --> 52:21.780
Fuck you, Jade.

52:21.780 --> 52:22.340
Check that out.

52:22.340 --> 52:24.180
You think you get two placements?

52:24.180 --> 52:24.980
Nah, nah.

52:26.500 --> 52:27.380
Look at this.

52:27.380 --> 52:31.220
It's still your name, but I just drew a grave around it.

52:31.220 --> 52:35.140
Now it looks like Jade is buried here.

52:35.140 --> 52:37.140
Now, what about with very little altering?

52:37.140 --> 52:37.620
Yeah.

52:37.620 --> 52:38.500
Jada Pinkett Smith.

52:38.500 --> 52:39.780
Or just Jaden.

52:39.780 --> 52:40.500
Jaden Smith.

52:40.500 --> 52:43.540
Jaden would be easier, because you could just add the N instead of having to-

52:43.540 --> 52:46.820
Yeah, but if you're not a fan of Jaden, then you're just a friend of Jada.

52:46.820 --> 52:48.100
I don't really like...

52:48.100 --> 52:49.780
I like the source material.

52:49.780 --> 52:51.140
Do not like the byproduct.

52:52.020 --> 52:52.340
No.

52:52.340 --> 52:53.060
No, thanks.

52:53.060 --> 52:55.140
You mix a little Will Smith in there.

52:55.140 --> 52:56.820
It's very distasteful for me.

52:56.820 --> 53:00.420
Pardon me, Jaden, but I saw the new karate kid,

53:00.420 --> 53:02.580
and I'm having a stroke.

53:03.780 --> 53:05.300
All my wutes are wrong.

53:08.820 --> 53:09.700
Strokes are funny.

53:09.700 --> 53:12.820
Could you write dragon at the end of it?

53:12.820 --> 53:15.700
And then it's like Jade dragon, and then it's like a mysterious,

53:15.700 --> 53:18.980
like a mysterious source of power in your chakra.

53:19.780 --> 53:20.260
Chakram.

53:21.220 --> 53:22.980
What about giant butterfly?

53:24.420 --> 53:25.220
But it would still say...

53:26.180 --> 53:26.660
We would still say Jade.

53:26.660 --> 53:27.860
Where's the joke?

53:27.860 --> 53:28.740
There's no joke.

53:28.740 --> 53:29.780
I like butterflies.

53:29.780 --> 53:30.900
Cool.

53:30.900 --> 53:31.380
Don't judge.

53:31.380 --> 53:32.340
Is that how tattoos work?

53:32.340 --> 53:35.940
Can you just put a thing over it or...

53:35.940 --> 53:37.220
Do you remember the game upwards?

53:37.220 --> 53:37.460
Yeah.

53:37.460 --> 53:38.180
It's a lot like that.

53:38.180 --> 53:38.900
Is it?

53:38.900 --> 53:41.860
If somebody gets tattoos over and over again on the same spot,

53:41.860 --> 53:43.940
they'll just have like a dorsal fin by the end of it.

53:45.380 --> 53:46.340
What's wrong with your back?

53:46.980 --> 53:49.060
It says Jaden mystery, and then there's a butterfly.

53:49.060 --> 53:51.540
I was a big fan of Jason Mraz back in the day,

53:51.540 --> 53:52.980
and I needed to get that covered up.

53:53.860 --> 53:57.140
And then he just kept dragging me back in with his siren call.

53:57.140 --> 54:00.660
Change your tattoo so it says Jades and Mraz.

54:01.620 --> 54:02.500
Just so people know.

54:03.140 --> 54:04.660
JDR diet pills?

54:04.660 --> 54:06.660
There you can get an ad.

54:06.660 --> 54:07.220
Can you...

54:07.220 --> 54:07.780
Sponsorship.

54:07.780 --> 54:08.260
Here's what you...

54:08.260 --> 54:09.060
I got it.

54:09.060 --> 54:10.020
You get an eraser.

54:10.580 --> 54:12.020
A tattoo eraser.

54:12.020 --> 54:13.460
Erase the E.

54:13.460 --> 54:14.260
Have another kid.

54:14.260 --> 54:14.980
Name him Jad.

54:16.980 --> 54:17.300
Or...

54:18.420 --> 54:18.740
Or...

54:19.860 --> 54:22.100
Erase the D and the E, and then it's just...

54:22.100 --> 54:22.600
Ja!

54:23.300 --> 54:23.800
Or...

54:24.420 --> 54:26.020
Erase the D and the E,

54:26.020 --> 54:28.500
and then put an I and then a space and an HL,

54:28.500 --> 54:31.380
and then it's Jai Ho like in the Slumdog Millionaire movie.

54:31.380 --> 54:32.180
You guys...

54:32.180 --> 54:32.740
That's...

54:32.740 --> 54:33.860
That's timely.

54:33.860 --> 54:34.980
I'm not a bad mother.

54:34.980 --> 54:36.500
I'm just a big fan of Slumdog Millionaire.

54:36.500 --> 54:38.020
I love Jai Ho.

54:39.540 --> 54:40.820
That's how that song goes.

54:40.820 --> 54:42.340
The Jason Mraz cover of Jai Ho.

54:42.340 --> 54:42.820
Did you hear it?

54:44.580 --> 54:45.460
So crunchy.

54:45.460 --> 54:46.100
Jai Ho.

54:49.460 --> 54:50.020
Bong.

54:50.020 --> 54:53.140
Fuck.

54:53.140 --> 54:56.660
So once the show has been reduced to just clicks and noises,

54:57.700 --> 54:58.900
we don't have to do it anymore.

54:58.900 --> 54:59.620
Is that the rule?

54:59.620 --> 55:00.420
That's usually...

55:00.420 --> 55:01.060
That's usually the rule.

55:01.060 --> 55:03.620
Once we've convinced everyone else to turn it off,

55:03.620 --> 55:04.420
we can stop doing it.

55:04.420 --> 55:06.500
Erase the J, replace it with an S,

55:06.500 --> 55:07.860
and then it's a Sade tattoo.

55:08.500 --> 55:09.220
You're welcome.

55:13.940 --> 55:15.780
Erase the A, turn it into a U.

55:15.780 --> 55:16.580
Jude Law.

55:16.580 --> 55:18.020
There's so many opportunities here.

55:18.020 --> 55:19.860
Get rid of the J, add a D at the end.

55:19.860 --> 55:20.980
Put an F at the beginning.

55:20.980 --> 55:21.700
It's faded.

55:23.220 --> 55:24.020
Come on, brah.

55:24.020 --> 55:24.420
E.

55:24.420 --> 55:26.820
Lose the E, put a D in.

55:26.820 --> 55:27.220
Judd.

55:27.220 --> 55:28.260
Ashley Judd.

55:28.260 --> 55:28.740
No, wait.

55:28.740 --> 55:29.860
You got to get a U in there.

55:29.860 --> 55:30.420
Fuck.

55:30.420 --> 55:30.980
Hold up.

55:30.980 --> 55:31.860
Let me try it again.

55:31.860 --> 55:33.940
Lose the J, add a B and an L,

55:33.940 --> 55:36.260
and then you're celebrating Wesley Snipes' movie.

55:36.820 --> 55:38.260
Get rid of the D, E, put IL.

55:38.260 --> 55:38.580
Jail.

55:38.580 --> 55:39.220
Jail tattoo.

55:43.140 --> 55:44.980
Here's the solution for all of this.

55:44.980 --> 55:49.940
Just get a tattoo of somebody else around it that has that tattoo.

55:49.940 --> 55:52.020
So it's not you that has a tattoo of Jade.

55:52.820 --> 55:54.260
Your tattoo has it.

55:54.260 --> 55:57.380
Your tattoo has a tattoo of Jade.

55:57.380 --> 55:58.820
I don't know where he got it.

55:58.820 --> 56:01.700
He wandered off for five minutes and came back with it.

56:01.700 --> 56:04.980
Baby, it's not that I love Jade more.

56:04.980 --> 56:07.620
It's that that guy from Pawn Stars loves Jade more,

56:07.620 --> 56:09.300
and I have a tattoo of him.

56:09.300 --> 56:09.780
So you see it.

56:09.780 --> 56:11.380
Vic Haas loves it more.

56:11.380 --> 56:15.300
It is actually his tattoo from that, what's that, Fat Beats?

56:16.340 --> 56:19.700
His name is, his name is Jade.

56:21.300 --> 56:21.780
Perfect.

56:22.660 --> 56:23.940
Ideal scenario.

56:24.580 --> 56:27.380
I'm so glad that that worked out and was true.

56:27.380 --> 56:32.260
How much work would it take to get that Jade changed to just Cray Sean?

56:32.260 --> 56:33.700
How many letters is that different?

56:38.580 --> 56:40.980
Just get a big black bar over it.

56:40.980 --> 56:43.860
People say, I thought you had a tattoo of your daughter's name there.

56:43.860 --> 56:44.900
Actually, fuck her.

56:46.180 --> 56:47.300
I hate that kid.

56:47.300 --> 56:48.020
I'm over it.

56:49.220 --> 56:51.140
She had a good run, but it's done.

56:51.140 --> 56:56.260
How did you not realize that you got the same word tattooed on your body twice, you dumb?

56:56.260 --> 56:57.060
Oh, shit.

56:57.060 --> 56:57.460
Damn it.

56:57.460 --> 56:58.180
Oh, fuck.

56:58.180 --> 56:59.460
I already had a Jade.

56:59.460 --> 57:00.020
Fuck.

57:00.020 --> 57:02.420
It's not like when you go to the supermarket,

57:02.420 --> 57:05.860
you go to Target and you buy season five of Top Chef and you get home and you're like,

57:05.860 --> 57:08.420
oh, fuck, I thought I had season four, but now I have two seasons.

57:08.420 --> 57:09.860
It's a word on your body.

57:09.860 --> 57:12.180
I don't have any of those.

57:12.180 --> 57:13.620
If I had one, I would know it.

57:14.340 --> 57:15.780
Stupid fuck.

57:17.220 --> 57:17.540
Fuck.

57:19.940 --> 57:23.060
This has been my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

57:23.060 --> 57:26.580
Thank you so much for listening yet again to our program.

57:28.100 --> 57:30.820
I know that that sounded just there like a rough edit,

57:30.820 --> 57:31.780
but in actuality, that is the pace.

57:31.780 --> 57:33.300
We just ran out of steam.

57:33.300 --> 57:36.180
We just ran out of steam and knew it when it happened.

57:36.180 --> 57:37.380
It's these summertime months.

57:37.380 --> 57:38.820
We all have to turn our ACs off.

57:38.820 --> 57:39.860
I'm like delirious.

57:39.860 --> 57:42.820
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues.

57:42.820 --> 57:43.320
Right.

57:44.340 --> 57:49.620

58:30.660 --> 58:34.260

I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

58:37.220 --> 58:39.940

58:40.900 --> 58:43.620
It's a it's a it's a fantastic little album.

58:43.620 --> 58:46.500

58:47.300 --> 58:48.020
Excuse me.

59:47.220 --> 59:49.300
If you're afraid of links and things.

59:49.300 --> 59:50.260
Don't be afraid.

59:50.260 --> 59:52.900
Also, tickets are on sale for Max Fun Con East.

59:53.940 --> 59:57.380
We all got back from Max Fun Con West earlier this month.

59:57.380 --> 01:00:00.660
And I think we can all agree it was the fucking best time ever.

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.460
So, um, that's definitely a thing you should check out.

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:06.660
If you, if you live on the East Coast, it's going to be held in the Poconos.

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:09.780
And, uh, surely a beautiful and majestic vista.

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.780
So, uh, yeah, tickets are on sale right now.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.500
You can get them through the Max Fun Con, uh, website.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.580
This Yahoo Answer was sent in by question mark.

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.540
Thank you, question mark.

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:19.780
It's by Yahoo Answers user Frankie who asks,

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:23.460
can I get my dad arrested for watching the news?

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.180
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:27.380
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.420
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:31.140
Kiss your dad.

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:32.660
Square on the lips.

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:38.660
Keep your heart.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:39.540
Three stacks.

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:40.500
Keep your heart.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.780
Hey, keep your heart.

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:42.660
Three stacks.

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.700
Keep your heart.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.980
Man, these girls are smart.

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:45.700
Three stacks.

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.820
These girls are smart.

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:56.420
Play your part, play your part.
