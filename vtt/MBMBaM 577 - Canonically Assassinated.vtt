WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980

01:16.820 --> 01:22.820
Hey, would you have knocked over the vase if I hadn't said anything woof woof big dog Travis woof woof McElroy

01:22.820 --> 01:29.820
What on God's green earth are you two doing? Hi, this is Griffin. What on God's green and blue?

01:29.820 --> 01:32.820
Griffin I'm dodging all of your judgments. Whoa

01:32.820 --> 01:33.820
Whoa

01:33.820 --> 01:37.820
That's right folks we're headed back into the matrix

01:37.820 --> 01:40.820
Matrix resurrections

01:40.820 --> 01:42.820
Matrix resurrections

01:42.820 --> 01:47.520
We're here. We're getting there matrix for Lana Wachowski is gonna take us

01:48.180 --> 01:51.300
Into her world of the matrix, and we're all gonna go on a journey together

01:52.180 --> 01:59.340
Into the matrix, and that's right. We back out here. I know what you're thinking folks weren't we just in the matrix?

01:59.340 --> 02:02.140
There's no way you could possibly know what I'm thinking at this very moment

02:02.140 --> 02:07.340
You're thinking weren't we just in the matrix, but the matrix here's the thing about the matrix guys one

02:07.340 --> 02:14.220
It's way long ago. You don't realize it cuz like you probably just watched them again. Yeah way long ago like

02:14.940 --> 02:17.780
It's true right cuz now it's all computers

02:18.260 --> 02:20.740
Yeah, yeah now. It's all computers online

02:20.980 --> 02:26.540
I can't believe that they're making a fucking matrix film has been so long since last one

02:26.540 --> 02:31.060
Are you kidding me with this Tara Reeves neo more like although listen hey

02:32.180 --> 02:34.180
Listen the only

02:34.380 --> 02:36.380
Into is Viagra you know

02:36.380 --> 02:38.820
All right, no, I wouldn't say

02:40.820 --> 02:43.780
Okay, but not at the not at the expense of Keanu Reeves

02:43.780 --> 02:48.780
I know it's like I'm doing kind of a bit like it's like what kind of jokes are there about matrix

02:48.780 --> 02:53.620
Those are the jokes that I have about me. Well. Here's the thing I watched the trailer whoa Jonathan Groff's in this bitch

02:53.620 --> 02:55.940
Yeah, yes, wait don't give away anything else

02:56.300 --> 03:01.240
Damn cuz Griffin hasn't seen the trailer, but Griffin is a huge matrix

03:01.240 --> 03:07.760
Code monkey as they can I see can I step outside the bit yeah, I really I really do love those films quite a bit

03:07.760 --> 03:09.760
Yeah, they're very good

03:14.600 --> 03:20.040
I mean the first the first the first no they're all good in their own way. They're all very good

03:20.040 --> 03:23.200
I have like the space orgy underground love that fuck yes

03:23.400 --> 03:29.760
Fuck so good Griffin. What do you think is revealed in the new trailer?

03:29.760 --> 03:33.400
the new trailer yeah, or the

03:34.160 --> 03:36.160
only one so far if

03:36.680 --> 03:41.640
If memory serves the end of the third matrix movie was kind of a total party wipe

03:44.240 --> 03:48.520
The Keanu is in this one is astonishing to me

03:49.880 --> 03:54.840
It's the resurrection sits right there on the title Griffin. I guess they do say it right there

03:54.840 --> 04:00.920
They say right there on the tile you're not okay Griffin. I know I'm gonna ask you

04:00.920 --> 04:04.040
What do you think is in this trailer? I think there's a matrix in the matrix

04:04.040 --> 04:06.800
I think they want one. I think they went one deeper

04:06.800 --> 04:13.760
I think that there's the real world in which we are set up by cattle into batteries and the machines love our juices and so

04:13.760 --> 04:18.040
They put us in matrix so they can take our juices, but then in matrix. It's like but damn

04:18.400 --> 04:20.400
There's some good stuff happening here, too

04:20.400 --> 04:26.520
We're gonna matrix them you know they're on there and there and this is what I'm talking about the phones tik-tok and tumblr all of us

04:26.520 --> 04:28.520
Are sort of our way out Griffin?

04:29.920 --> 04:34.880
So you have wait have you'd actually not watch the trailer. I've genuinely not

04:36.600 --> 04:39.080
Matrix there's a scene in the trailer

04:39.080 --> 04:44.560
There's a clip where everyone's on their phones and the key on is in an elevator surrounded by people on their phones and a guy

04:44.560 --> 04:51.200
Loses funny kind of chuckles, and I guess that's a bad thing to find your own entertaining all those guys are on their phones

04:51.400 --> 04:54.000
They love to talk believe this yes

04:55.160 --> 04:57.720
Lana get at me. Let's yes

04:58.720 --> 05:03.480
Let's collab. This is fucking awesome. I also someone Lily's taking a step back

05:03.480 --> 05:07.520
You need someone to bounce the ideas off right in Griffin get Griffin in Griffin

05:07.520 --> 05:11.600
Which is Griffin in I also I went into it. This is not a joke

05:11.600 --> 05:19.040
Like joking to myself. I wonder if they'll catch up with what that cat from the like from the like

05:19.800 --> 05:24.040
Deja vu moment what what that cat's been up to right hats in the trailer

05:24.440 --> 05:31.800
Cats and Chuck you want to lose your mind Griffin. I'm just gonna five seconds. Here's the last line of the trailer delivered by

05:32.600 --> 05:34.600
Mr.. Groff himself

05:34.600 --> 05:40.080
Bringing it are you ready? Yeah, cuz you might get too pumped. It's okay. It's the most trailer line

05:40.080 --> 05:42.560
You're not gonna fucking believe that. This is the last line of the trailer

05:42.560 --> 05:46.560
You're reading a script as an actor, and you get a line like this. You're like well. That's not getting cut

05:46.600 --> 05:48.960
There's no way all right you ready mm-hmm

05:50.760 --> 05:56.340
After all these years to be going back to where it all started back to the matrix

06:01.160 --> 06:06.720
Griffin I know I'm thinking is that just a clip from like a red carpet interview that Jonathan Groff did no no no

06:06.720 --> 06:11.360
No, that's a scene in the movie. It's in the movie. That's in the matrix all right

06:12.320 --> 06:14.320
is in it

06:15.560 --> 06:22.080
Is he the new fucking agents agent Smith or whatever he's the new Morpheus. There's four Morphe I

06:22.920 --> 06:30.160
Actually, that's not actually there's the fire more to it the water Morphe I earth Morphe I and air Morphe I when they get together

06:31.960 --> 06:34.320
Don't think Larry made it for this one well

06:34.320 --> 06:37.920
I don't think Justin. There's a reason in matrix online

06:38.800 --> 06:40.080
more

06:40.080 --> 06:42.080
canonically assassinated

06:42.320 --> 06:47.840
But are you saying Larry is not in this film because he's canonically assassinated in the matrix online

06:48.360 --> 06:49.760
matrix online

06:49.760 --> 06:51.760
Morpheus is canonically

06:52.160 --> 06:54.440
Assassinated and so you get a younger

06:55.040 --> 06:57.120
Hipper Morpheus

06:57.120 --> 07:03.080
Perhaps part of the resurrections once more cool cool cool Trinity. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

07:03.080 --> 07:08.400
Oh, yeah, and it got a big part looking great by the way has not aged a day

07:08.960 --> 07:15.800
It's that matrix, but he has even killed fucking fantastic. Yeah, I felt bad about like I had it was so funny

07:16.160 --> 07:18.160
Yeah, we remember

07:19.000 --> 07:24.160
Yeah, I liked in the trailer where there was like you know there's like a voice over

07:24.160 --> 07:27.120
And you're like always is he gonna be in it is it gonna be in it is he gonna be in it?

07:27.120 --> 07:29.600
And then you just hear Joey pants like I love steak

07:29.600 --> 07:48.120
I love steak and redheads. Ah, is there a scene... Joey pants ain't in it. He was canonically assassinated in the matrix online. First DLC attack of the cyber machines. Yeah

07:49.200 --> 07:51.200
Is there a scene where

07:51.840 --> 07:53.080
fucking

07:53.080 --> 07:59.400
Mr. Anderson or Keanu's John Anderson, I think is his name Neo Neo Thomas Anderson

07:59.400 --> 08:01.400
Thomas Anderson, he's at a fucking

08:02.400 --> 08:07.160
Paul Thomas Anderson's at a Panera bread and he gets his bread bowl with his cheese and broccolini soup and

08:07.720 --> 08:13.680
He like reaches into the utensil drawer and grabs a fork and he's like wait a minute. Excuse me, sir

08:14.560 --> 08:18.720
Where's the spoons and the cashier just smiles and it is the little boy

08:23.040 --> 08:26.060
Can I just say Griffin how you there's no Griffin

08:26.060 --> 08:30.120
It's weird that you knew about the bread bowls because that is actually the new red pill blue pill

08:30.120 --> 08:35.000
Yeah, cuz that got all that like you want a broccoli soup. Mr. Anderson, right?

08:35.000 --> 08:39.400
All that iconography got co-opted by dipshits so you can't do red pill blue pill anymore

08:39.400 --> 08:46.320
Yeah, now it's like do you want the red broccoli cheese soup bread? Yeah, or a slushie. Can I tell you what's wild Griffin?

08:46.360 --> 08:51.760
What all joking aside there is a clip in the trailer where he's like walking through a cafe and

08:51.760 --> 08:57.260
And like looks over and someone's reading Alice through the window glass and I think it's like the prophet. I think it's like

08:57.820 --> 09:02.500
The legs smiles at him. Hey, please go ask Alice is the true

09:05.380 --> 09:12.860
But it's kind of exactly oh fucking good he wears there is I mean he's wearing a beanie

09:13.220 --> 09:17.940
He's wearing a beanie and dropping a bunch of his pills down the sink. Yeah like that. I like that

09:17.940 --> 09:22.220
I like that. Is there a gooey mirror? Is there? Yes. Yes. Yes

09:23.500 --> 09:25.500
He looks in it and he kind of looks like

09:26.660 --> 09:28.660
Looks like all

09:29.100 --> 09:31.100
Yeah

09:31.540 --> 09:33.540
He looks like

09:33.940 --> 09:38.060
It's dead on Justin. It's right. It's it's weird, right?

09:38.060 --> 09:42.900
It's like the movie the mirror is a Gucci mirror and is also showing the revenant. Yeah

09:43.460 --> 09:45.380
It's a streaming mirror

09:45.380 --> 09:48.120
There's great parts. Like people do

09:49.740 --> 09:56.860
Buildings and then the buildings break and then here's a part where someone shoots a rocket and Neos like I don't think so today

09:56.860 --> 10:01.820
Yeah, thanks. And then you miss a missus a rocket in an air in a different

10:02.420 --> 10:09.020
Rocket bending. It's amazing rocket. No more bullets for me. Thank you. Just right now, but there's a scene

10:09.020 --> 10:15.980
But let me ask a question they fight with kung-fu in a magical dojo. Okay, but listen in there

10:15.980 --> 10:17.980
But listen, yeah

10:18.780 --> 10:21.260
What the fuck is Neil Patrick Harris doing in this

10:21.940 --> 10:28.940
Yeah, he just he keeps looking at the camera saying I'm so excited to be in the matrix is why it's why it's amazing

10:28.940 --> 10:36.740
There's a bunch of new characters and I swear to God they have this entire like army that have freed themselves from the gender binary

10:36.740 --> 10:40.300
It's amazing. Yeah, it's an incredible army of

10:41.900 --> 10:43.900
Soldiers

10:47.460 --> 10:53.300
So cool, they're like all the cool I don't love young Morpheus is the one thing

10:55.820 --> 10:57.820
Actually, I

10:57.820 --> 11:04.900
Want to watch it in it. Oh, hey the in it from the video game this. Yeah, canonically the matrix

11:04.900 --> 11:11.940
Yeah from according to IMDB Jada Pinkett Smith who is not she's not just to the video game. She was in. Oh, that's right

11:11.940 --> 11:16.700
That's why she was heavily she was sure didn't have a featured is what you were thinking. Yeah, man

11:16.700 --> 11:22.340
I'm way more plugged into the fucking matrix universe than I assume. Why do you know so much about online?

11:22.340 --> 11:24.340
Maybe you need to unplug a little bit copper top

11:24.340 --> 11:30.340
I love steak. I love steak

11:31.980 --> 11:34.940
Cool, I can't wait for this fucking movie to come out

11:36.580 --> 11:40.860
Awesome a little crimp a little crimbo action coming out on crimbo. Sorry kids

11:40.860 --> 11:43.940

12:01.100 --> 12:04.060

12:04.740 --> 12:09.180
Apparently, you know the matrix a lot because my kids are gonna be like dad. Where is it Morpheus?

12:10.220 --> 12:12.540
Dad hold on dad's gonna set up a server

12:12.540 --> 12:18.140
In the house somewhere we're gonna fucking VPN into this private server

12:19.500 --> 12:23.900
You can see the death of Morpheus who is canonically assassinated. Yeah, hold on

12:23.900 --> 12:28.980
I can pull up some playthrough videos on YouTube. No dad. I have experience in myself where I was

12:30.140 --> 12:31.820
Come on

12:31.820 --> 12:37.820
God this fucking rules. This is the only good thing to happen in the last only good thing is matrix. Yeah

12:37.820 --> 12:44.260
Thank you. The matrix. We need the matrix. Hey, maybe it's such a big hit get sensei season three, you know

12:45.420 --> 12:48.320
Please you never know. Hey

12:49.860 --> 12:53.780
My show and we're gonna make a second speed racer

12:55.740 --> 13:01.280
The the Wachowskis in a hundred years everyone be like, how are you people losing you're right

13:01.900 --> 13:05.180
Why did you all sleep on that? Like this? What's wrong?

13:05.180 --> 13:07.280
Wachowskis make a movie. We're fucking

13:08.100 --> 13:15.460
Mila Kunis is swarmed by bees who can smell her royalty and fucking there's a dog prince

13:15.460 --> 13:17.860
And people are like, I don't think we need to see that one

13:17.860 --> 13:21.060
I think we need to skip that one. I don't think we need to see where this one goes like are you sure?

13:21.820 --> 13:25.060
Fuck is the matter with you? They just smell royalty. Are you sure?

13:25.980 --> 13:32.160
Channy's a dog man. All right, we don't deserve him. No. No, we absolutely do not.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.720
I

13:33.720 --> 13:40.280
Recently switched apartments. Okay. I like setting the thermostat to 69. Yeah, I find it funny

13:40.280 --> 13:44.180
It's also a comfortable temperature. One of my roommates keeps changing it to 70

13:44.220 --> 13:50.040
He's done this multiple times that bums me out every time. Why does he do this? How can I figure out who it is?

13:50.400 --> 13:54.840
What should I do once I know who it is? That's from 69 is a nice temperature

13:55.540 --> 14:00.080
Let's settle. Can we settle this right away? First and foremost 69 is

14:00.080 --> 14:03.760
Quite cold. That's whoa, very chilly. Oh

14:04.760 --> 14:09.320
That is my chosen temp. No, no, you know in your home in your home

14:09.320 --> 14:14.000
I was always so cold there. I love no nice 74

14:16.200 --> 14:18.200
You want to live in a rainforest

14:18.360 --> 14:24.880
All right, 75 in the daytime 73 at night that two-degree difference. You feel it. You know it you love it

14:24.880 --> 14:26.400
You have to have it

14:26.400 --> 14:31.360
69 degree. I mean, I guess it depends on where you live in, Texas. I could not I could not maintain

14:31.840 --> 14:38.640
No, an internal temperature of 69 degrees in Texas. No, yeah is where you need to be for a nice sleep

14:38.640 --> 14:44.880
That's what science says but in the during the day, it's hot outside. It should be kind of hot in your house a little bit

14:44.880 --> 14:46.880
Don't unplug from the world. Yeah

14:47.800 --> 14:49.240
I

14:49.240 --> 14:52.160
want fall all year round

14:52.160 --> 14:58.920
But then that doesn't make it exciting when fall comes and there's a slight chill a slight chill by which I mean

14:58.920 --> 15:04.400
It's like 82 degrees in the morning in Texas here now, and I'm like fucking ready for a flannel time

15:04.880 --> 15:10.260
But if it's if it's 69 in my house all day all in all you got in my house all day

15:12.080 --> 15:16.080
The reason your roommate does this they're appeared all day Justin

15:16.080 --> 15:21.440
40 years old day in do you have an IV going or is this too personal?

15:22.600 --> 15:29.020
Go on Travis. No, let's focus on Travis at being 60 not like that temperature trap. It's too low, but it's too low

15:29.040 --> 15:34.260
You're too low. You're probably I would let it check it. I would shudder to look at your electric bill

15:34.260 --> 15:38.440
I would shudder no because it's a maintaining a constant temperature when it hits that temperature

15:38.480 --> 15:44.480
We have let me be clear everybody very good windows. They really keep that in

15:44.480 --> 15:48.960
We've got blackout curtains. We're in Ohio. It ain't bad

15:49.160 --> 15:54.200
You've made a cave like you've made a bed in that's not something to brag about

15:54.480 --> 15:56.920
That's what oh if I could have

15:57.800 --> 16:03.660
Phosphorescent lighting and that'd be it. Oh, there's just a massive to answer the question like there's a like, you know how

16:04.400 --> 16:10.980
We only put a value on things like a million because we have ten fingers, right? It's like it's all based in

16:10.980 --> 16:16.620
Sure, I mean, I think if you saw a million like bricks you'd be like that's a fuck ton of bricks

16:16.620 --> 16:18.460
No matter how many fingers you have

16:18.460 --> 16:18.700
Yeah

16:18.700 --> 16:24.420
But you wouldn't be more fuck ton of breaks than like 900,000 bricks you would still you would look at that and be like Tim

16:24.420 --> 16:26.700
That's a lot of you don't think you would notice a difference between

16:27.940 --> 16:29.960
100,000 saying you wouldn't notice a difference

16:29.960 --> 16:36.900
I'm saying that when you put that millionth millionth brick on the pile you would turn around and be like everyone

16:36.900 --> 16:44.220
I've done something and we're all I see okay, because of my ten fingers. I have achieved it. You know, I mean, I've achieved it

16:44.220 --> 16:48.100
Okay, I feel like 69 and 70 is a large

16:48.140 --> 16:53.020
There's a large psychological gap because in the 69 it could be in the 60s

16:53.580 --> 17:00.420
It could be chilly in the 70s. It could be darn right hot and it's like you're in the like that one

17:01.340 --> 17:04.940
Sliver of a degree is actually there's a big psychological difference

17:04.940 --> 17:08.140
So maybe the room is just like god, it's freezing. I'm just gonna turn

17:08.860 --> 17:14.860
70 says you are absolutely right because if somebody says it's gonna scoot it up if somebody says oh, it's 69 degrees outside

17:14.860 --> 17:21.220
I'm like, oh first of all, you're like 30 second. Yeah. Yeah. I don't feel like 70 degrees. I'm sorry

17:21.220 --> 17:26.420
I'm like, oh short sleeves got it. Okay, cool. You're absolutely right Justin 70 degrees is short. Okay, it's

17:26.940 --> 17:31.060
It's right run hot. I know you do. I know you do

17:31.060 --> 17:35.560
I I'm struggling with this question because and I think probably a lot of our listeners are too

17:36.420 --> 17:37.780
because

17:37.780 --> 17:39.780
70 degrees to me is

17:40.020 --> 17:45.820
Also still pretty cold, but it's not as funny Griffin cuz it's not the sex number

17:46.700 --> 17:54.780
It's but that shouldn't be the reason that shouldn't be the guiding force for how you regulate your biorhythms

17:54.780 --> 18:02.660
Oh, no, because then I would set my thermostat to 420 degrees and burn my family a lot

18:06.220 --> 18:12.560
You're right I've always that always fucks me up yeah, but it would be I would be burning alive but cackling cuz it's like

18:15.540 --> 18:21.480
And then I would be reduced to ash I'm just saying if there's somewhat like a thermostat manufacturer listening

18:21.480 --> 18:25.640
Create a mode where they are. Yeah anywhere between

18:26.400 --> 18:31.520
65 and like 75 no matter where you set it. It still reads as 69

18:32.220 --> 18:37.560
Right. So that way we can still get the effect. Yeah, we still get the joke

18:37.560 --> 18:42.720
You can even put it in quotes on the display 69 right just paint over it

18:42.720 --> 18:51.440
Oh, yeah, and then you don't you're like your body doesn't shit my body definitely my body can tell the difference between 75 and 70

18:51.440 --> 18:53.360
Do you think if we blindfolded you?

18:53.360 --> 18:58.280
Yeah, I might put earplugs in or something and then we like lowered it or race it by a degree

18:58.280 --> 18:59.560
You'd be like, oh, that's 71

18:59.560 --> 19:05.440
if you said it to say if the thermostat was set to 74 degrees and then you covered my face and

19:05.440 --> 19:12.120
like with a bag with a bag and just like got rid of all senses, but touch right and then

19:13.000 --> 19:18.360
Either lowered or increase the temperature by one degree. I could for sure tell you like which direction

19:18.360 --> 19:24.840
Oh, we're gonna that's not that's yeah, like that's but that doesn't even seem that astonishing to me. That seems like something

19:24.840 --> 19:26.840
I don't think I'd notice

19:26.840 --> 19:30.480
Okay. All right, but I don't know how to test that

19:30.480 --> 19:35.480
Like we'll raise and lower at me and being like still fine. Yep, doing great

19:36.480 --> 19:40.080
Guys, I worry with all this 69 talk that things have gotten a little pure aisle

19:40.880 --> 19:46.160
So I thought I would like raise the brow a little bit. Oh, man. Oh wait. It's been a really long time

19:46.880 --> 19:51.440
Do you know what? I mean? Like it's been like a yeah, right? So it's like ready to come back with some work of art

19:53.040 --> 19:58.320
Of all of them of all of them to come back I think this was

19:58.320 --> 20:02.800
Well, it didn't come back Griffin. I just had to think a good one

20:02.800 --> 20:07.760
So it took a little while because street cart named these nuts really took it out of me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

20:07.760 --> 20:13.240
Yeah, so just a reminder how this works. Can I offer one thing just before you move forward? Sure. Sure. Sure

20:13.800 --> 20:17.080
después de todos estos años volver al origen de todo

20:18.240 --> 20:20.240
volver a matrix

20:22.440 --> 20:25.880
It hits good there too, it hits really good there too

20:25.880 --> 20:27.880
Back in the matrix after all these years

20:27.880 --> 20:34.200
Um, so well just a reminder. This would be I'm going to describe a classic work of art and

20:34.920 --> 20:38.280
Justin and Griffin will just give me the title. It's that simple. So like if I said

20:38.280 --> 20:42.760
Can you believe this is only the third time that Travis is I just googled my bim bam work of art

20:42.760 --> 20:48.120
Which the bim bam wiki describes as Travis modifies the titles of classic books into bathroom jokes

20:48.120 --> 20:50.120
That's fair, yeah

20:50.120 --> 20:57.920
And it's like it would be like if I said like Sun Tzu's classic guide to fighting a battle and also a little toot slips out

20:58.600 --> 21:02.020
And it would be in the fart of fart of war very short of war

21:02.720 --> 21:04.720
No, I just said

21:05.800 --> 21:09.120
Beats and thought zebra. Here we go. The first one

21:09.680 --> 21:14.760
Frank L bombs classic story of a quartet attempting to get what they desire

21:14.760 --> 21:20.660
But also the author focuses a lot on how the scarecrow makes semen

21:21.720 --> 21:23.720
That would be the

21:24.160 --> 21:29.280
This is correct. Okay. Now they're gonna get more difficult as it go on understand though, please understand dear brother

21:29.280 --> 21:31.400
The jizzard is not a word

21:32.840 --> 21:36.800
Please understand dear brother, please understand jizzard is not a word

21:36.800 --> 21:43.920
It is it's the it's a wizard of jizz, okay? Oh

21:49.600 --> 21:51.600
I'm sure they have

21:51.600 --> 22:02.700
No, Justin at the very least I want to seen the word gizzard and mispronounced it. Okay. Oh do not

22:06.560 --> 22:08.560
Is this your first day on the internet

22:09.640 --> 22:12.000
Now round two. Yeah

22:12.960 --> 22:14.240
this

22:14.240 --> 22:17.260
Fscot Fitzgerald classic involves Nick

22:17.260 --> 22:23.880
Nick befriending a wealthy bon vivant and man about town who's in love with Daisy and also

22:24.340 --> 22:26.340
Poops himself a lot

22:27.180 --> 22:32.980
Shatsby, I'm sorry. What was that the great shots be that's correct Griffin. Good job

22:33.540 --> 22:36.620
Griffin you're so good at this game. You're really good this game

22:36.620 --> 22:41.940
I wish I could come up with this pure awesome as quickly as you track Griffin. Okay, I got I'm twisted

22:41.940 --> 22:49.100
That's one more just more this Charles Dickens classic tells the tale of how Ebenezer Scrooge's life has changed

22:49.500 --> 22:53.900
when a series of ghosts inserts their closed hands into his butthole

23:03.540 --> 23:07.060
Griffin I'm so deeply impressed by how quickly

23:08.580 --> 23:09.820
Not

23:09.820 --> 23:14.700
Difficult, it's not it's a rhyme with the worst word you can think of

23:15.020 --> 23:20.180
Justin was hours behind you on that. I'm still trying to get I still don't get Jessa DeVos

23:20.220 --> 23:26.740
Yeah, but here you are Griffin before I can even finish like oh this is Carol. You were so excited by are you finished?

23:27.380 --> 23:31.780
Are you finished Griffin? Do you want to come up with something? You're so good at this. I

23:32.620 --> 23:34.620
Bet I could but yeah

23:34.620 --> 23:40.740
I really don't want to yeah, maybe on the next oops all bets. Yeah, that'd be great. I would love to do to switch

23:42.500 --> 23:45.420
Well, I mean this is actually a great

23:45.420 --> 23:51.460
I would love a comeuppance here for Travis and I found just the way to do it. Let's approach the jizzers

23:52.580 --> 23:53.660
Nice

23:53.660 --> 23:59.540
This one was sent in by Omni present millipede. Thank you. It's a wiki how article that is

Okay, I promise you won't listen. I'm plugging my ears for sure

24:18.980 --> 24:22.340
Juice number one plan a big attack from the closet

24:23.260 --> 24:28.540
This is an absolutely brilliant plan first pick a time when your brother doesn't think you're home and nobody else is there then hide in

24:28.540 --> 24:33.900
A closet maybe your own then quietly call the house from your cell phone and when he answers the phone say you need him to

24:33.900 --> 24:37.340
Go in your closet and then we open to you jump out and go like boo

24:37.420 --> 24:43.180
And then he won't expect to see you there and he will freak out you'll be able to hold this one against him for years

24:43.460 --> 24:44.780
So you wanna try that?

24:44.780 --> 24:47.820
Griffin got fist with Carol right away. Yeah, get in the closet

24:49.180 --> 24:55.900

Attack brother to attack my brother to attack brother strong person to attack brother. That's actually like if I could say as far as pranks go

26:18.020 --> 26:21.720
hiring someone to hide in their closet and then attack them I

26:22.620 --> 26:29.040
Could still do the cell phone thing and they could see me I could like be like come to the window and look out

26:29.040 --> 26:34.320
Do you see that? I'm here. Yeah, there's any way I'm in your closet right now, and they're like, I don't think so

Yeah, just in the attack. I watch a lot of like police procedural dramas and I would

26:40.780 --> 26:46.080
Just I would point out that hiring someone to hide in someone's closet and attack them

26:46.580 --> 26:48.580
might might

26:48.620 --> 26:52.220

29:57.260 --> 30:00.020
And rub that good cream all over oh, that's delicious

30:00.020 --> 30:06.660
I'm just eating the cream now. He's just eating the cream

30:07.580 --> 30:09.940
Is this low fat? Fuck you?

30:10.580 --> 30:13.740
It's it's ready with Justin quick. Give him a wedgie

30:14.340 --> 30:20.860
Wait until he turns away from you. Good luck. I'm not wearing underpants. Oh god. No, I keep reaching lower and lower

30:20.860 --> 30:23.820
There's nothing you'll find it. Don't give up. It's in there

30:23.820 --> 30:30.920
Can you scratch right there though while you're there? Oh God Justin just quick. Here's an actual suggestion

30:32.140 --> 30:34.140
Stick paper on his butt

30:34.140 --> 30:39.380
What why well is a quick and easy one you get a piece of paper that's similar color to a surface like a couch or

30:39.380 --> 30:41.700
Chair and then you put glue on it and when he gets up

30:41.700 --> 30:43.700
He'll be walking around with a piece of paper on his booty

30:44.740 --> 30:48.420
Did they literally stop there? They didn't say like write something on it

30:48.420 --> 30:55.100
Well, they said this is an updated version of the always effective. Kick me sign. So that's not always effective. It's never been effective

30:56.140 --> 31:01.180
Even though I'm somebody put a kick me sign on someone's back the other person who saw I was like, oh, come on

31:01.180 --> 31:04.900
Let me get that for you. There's a whole subcategory called bathroom pranks

31:04.900 --> 31:09.860
But none of them are quite as ribald as you would want them to be. Yeah, so let's jump straight to food pranks

31:09.940 --> 31:15.920
Okay, do I need to go to sleep again? It doesn't matter you haven't fallen for any easier like neo

31:15.920 --> 31:21.280
Yeah, just always dodging them Justin couldn't make a sponge look like cake

31:21.720 --> 31:27.520
But not an actual but like it's not an edible sponge. I got cleaning one put put chocolate on it

31:27.520 --> 31:29.880
So it's like a cake Travis. Well, I'll just save time. You know what?

31:29.880 --> 31:32.480
I'll just I don't want try to be excellent in the sponge. So I'll just make

31:33.200 --> 31:38.440
Like a sponge cake like a nice. Oh, you know what? Why don't you make a cake look like a sponge? That's really popular

31:39.520 --> 31:41.520

31:58.520 --> 32:02.000
Wait, I have to move this trash can close to you now drink this milk

Vomit

32:10.000 --> 32:14.800

32:14.800 --> 32:17.280

32:18.040 --> 32:21.400
You're drinking it. There's vinegar. I put vinegar in it. I love that

32:23.320 --> 32:28.400
Fuck he liked it. It didn't even work. It's really good for the system. Can we try again?

32:28.400 --> 32:31.000
But I'll put salt and pepper in it, which is okay

32:32.080 --> 32:33.400

33:20.560 --> 33:23.560
How did you get my controller to put it in jello?

33:24.080 --> 33:29.260
Yeah. Hey Travis got a love letter here for you. And this is a real one. I didn't write. Oh, is it from my wife?

33:29.260 --> 33:30.980

33:30.980 --> 33:33.840
Oh, then I don't want it Griffin. I'm a married man

33:34.380 --> 33:36.380

But I work with Hortense and see now this is gonna change our dynamic. Where's your where's your butt at? I know

34:07.080 --> 34:13.600
It's in the back of my pants like it always is. I know that the letter says responding to the words you say to it

34:13.680 --> 34:19.800
Yeah, yeah, so this pretty good pranks. Wait, that's the wait. Hold on Griffin. Yeah

34:20.360 --> 34:22.840
That's it write a fake love letter to someone

34:22.840 --> 34:24.840
Um

34:25.000 --> 34:28.920
Make a fake love letter sign from a girl in his class that he also has the same name girl

34:29.120 --> 34:35.000
In your class and place it in his book bag. He'll find the love letter and either confront the girl or tell his friends

34:35.800 --> 34:37.800
Sooner or later. He'll tell you guys

34:37.880 --> 34:42.240
Tell him that you have a girl that has the same exact name and likes a boy with his name

34:42.240 --> 34:48.240
He'll feel so embarrassed because the girl said she didn't and he told his friends Wow, that's Machiavellian

34:48.240 --> 34:50.240
Ah

34:51.240 --> 34:53.240
Twists and turns either

34:53.560 --> 34:59.000
Count of Monte Cristo. Wait, hold on guys. Could you explain? Did you prank me or what's happening?

34:59.000 --> 35:04.040
What's your love note from a girl who has the name of the same girl in a class?

35:04.040 --> 35:10.960
I'm in but she likes somebody who has the same name as you but it's not you and you just told your boys you fucking dumb

35:10.960 --> 35:15.000
Ass, is that why you're breaking me up behind this cask of a Monte Otto?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.840
Yeah, I'm breaking you breaking you right to pieces

35:19.120 --> 35:25.440
What a good pranks article. Thanks everybody. Thanks article great a lot of fun and

35:26.320 --> 35:32.500
Think about it that I mean, even if there weren't a lot of laughs. We are that much closer to matrix for

35:33.400 --> 35:36.320
So that you killed a little bit of time that way, you know

35:37.360 --> 35:39.360
Knives out to also

35:39.360 --> 35:45.800
I'm looking at most anticipated, you know. Yeah, man. Let's take a break

35:55.240 --> 35:56.600
I

35:56.600 --> 35:58.600
love sheets

35:59.360 --> 36:00.680
Man, I'm not even lying

36:00.680 --> 36:05.640
Like this is not one of those things of like I'm gonna put on airs to be like all sheets

36:05.640 --> 36:10.680
They're the best like I just got a new mattress. And so I was like time to order new sheets

36:11.280 --> 36:14.920
You know, it's been a lot of people challenging you be like, you don't actually like sheets

36:14.920 --> 36:18.640
I was like, you know, sometimes you're like I love sheets and they're like, well you enjoy sheets

36:18.640 --> 36:25.200
I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. No, I understand love. I need sheets. Yeah, that's why I love Brooklin

36:26.080 --> 36:30.680
Because listen Brooklin and I know what you're saying Travis. You just talked about how much you love sheets

36:30.680 --> 36:38.640
We know Brooklin and does great sheets. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. They do now imagine a company with the commitment to detail and comfort

36:39.240 --> 36:46.320
That they show to sheets bringing that to lounge wear. I'm afraid to think I'm afraid to imagine

36:46.320 --> 36:51.760
I know I know but let your mind dwell on that for just a moment Griffin because it's true

36:52.040 --> 36:57.600
Because the implications of that are are are profound. Yeah, it's gonna feel like you're wearing

36:57.600 --> 37:02.680
Bedding but in a right way, right? Yeah, and then it's like am I awake? Am I asleep?

37:03.600 --> 37:07.380
Like I don't know. I don't know if I'm awake. Yeah, is this the matrix?

37:07.400 --> 37:14.680
Nobody knows and Brooklin and offers bundle deals on lounge wear so you can get more. Did you say bungle deals bundle?

37:15.360 --> 37:21.080
Mr. Bungle deals. They don't laugh. Hey, hey, don't laugh. I thought that's what you said

37:22.040 --> 37:25.840
But if you bungle the word bundle you get some money off

37:25.840 --> 37:29.680
All right. I mean not everything has to be a joke

37:31.360 --> 37:38.600
And not only that they do candles and I'm asking all kind of accessories to help you. Yeah, I love Brooklin

37:38.600 --> 37:44.840
And I've got Brooklyn and sheets. I got Brooklyn and towels and I'm excited to wear Brooklyn and pants

37:45.080 --> 37:51.440
So get comfortable and get it for less at Brooklyn and go to Brooklyn and calm and use promo code my brother all one word

37:51.440 --> 37:56.280

38:04.120 --> 38:07.120
That's Brooklyn and comm promo code my brother

In the future, we'll all be batteries. And so we got to get off the internet now except for stamps calm

38:14.520 --> 38:21.360
Because with stamps calm you can print official US postage and shipping labels 24-7 without having to leave your desk or buy any kind

38:21.360 --> 38:23.360
of fancy equipment you just need your

38:23.720 --> 38:25.720
computer which is

38:26.440 --> 38:31.920
You got to have a pretty strict net nanny on this one just sort of locking you into stamps calm make that your home page

38:31.920 --> 38:33.800
And then throw away the keyboard

38:33.800 --> 38:36.320
and the printer cannot be

38:37.400 --> 38:41.160
Connected to the internet which is tricky. So you got to like

38:42.000 --> 38:44.480
Put this stuff you want to print the postage on floppy

38:45.120 --> 38:48.960
Disks and then print it out that way but they offer you deals at stamps calm

38:48.960 --> 38:54.120
You can't get anywhere else like up to 40% off USPS and up to 66% off UPS shipping rates

38:54.120 --> 38:57.240
And we got to get back together with this thing

38:57.840 --> 39:02.720
Using this postage that you get off the special offline version of stamps calm that you downloaded

39:02.720 --> 39:07.000

Because they will get in they will get in there. They're all just those little spidery robot guys. They're all gonna don't worry

39:25.080 --> 39:28.520

Never go to the post office again

39:53.280 --> 39:55.280
We have wasted this world

39:55.920 --> 40:01.480
Our magic put a storm in the sky that has rendered the surface of our planet uninhabitable

40:01.920 --> 40:06.760
But beneath the surface. Well, that's another story entirely

40:06.760 --> 40:13.840
In a city built leagues below the apocalypse survivors of the storm forged paths through a strange new world

40:14.400 --> 40:21.240
Some seek salvation for their homeland above others seek to chart the vast undersea expanse outside the city's walls

40:21.920 --> 40:24.720
And others still seek what else?

40:25.240 --> 40:27.240
fortune and glory

40:27.240 --> 40:35.440
Dive into the ether see the latest campaign from the adventure zone every other Thursday on maximum fun org or wherever you listen to

40:35.440 --> 40:37.440
podcasts

40:40.960 --> 40:44.920
It just occurred to me the other day guys that the title of the movie first wives club

40:44.920 --> 40:48.360
And I've never seen it, but it has nothing to do with like the president of the United States

40:48.360 --> 40:54.400
I think right it's like a play on words because they're like the first wives and like they're divorced and now they're second

40:54.400 --> 40:58.140
Oh, that's interesting. I always I also always assumed it was

40:58.140 --> 41:05.260
Um press presidential I've never seen it before so that's just my anybody who's seen that indelible film would not make that mistake

41:05.260 --> 41:07.940
So I'm assuming you have this that I know I haven't seen it

41:07.940 --> 41:13.420
I've said several times that I haven't seen I'm learning a lot about movies this episode. That's not gonna stop Griffin

41:13.420 --> 41:20.460
Okay, cuz great news finally, we're able to retire much squad. We huh? We hung the jersey up. No more much

41:21.700 --> 41:24.500
No more much squad this week cuz there weren't any good ones

41:24.500 --> 41:30.140
But I did want to take a second to start as a brand new bit for this week only it'll never happen again

41:30.140 --> 41:32.980
All right, it's called master of master of disguise

41:34.180 --> 41:40.580
Where there's the film the film master I have to thank Ryan for sending me one of these

41:41.700 --> 41:47.700
One of these reviews of master disguise of which on the service. I am to be there at 24,000 now Justin

41:47.700 --> 41:52.540
Just to be clear. This is master disguise a movie, which I'm going to guess came out in 2000

41:52.540 --> 41:54.540
very very close

41:54.740 --> 42:00.660
2002 you know how I you know how I know that for a fact why easy way to remember that master is

42:01.580 --> 42:03.580
2002 is that

42:04.900 --> 42:08.620
The turtle club scene was being filmed on 9-11

42:08.620 --> 42:12.940
Yes, so the when you see the turtle club scene that was being flown on 9-11

42:13.340 --> 42:18.660
So that's one thing you can remember about total a lot of things every time he says turtle. He's thinking about like

42:18.660 --> 42:22.300
The 9-11 is happening take the rest of the day off

42:22.340 --> 42:25.860
Should we stop the rest today and Dana Carvey was like don't or no

42:25.860 --> 42:30.900
We look guys if we stop filming master of disguise now the terrorists have won

42:31.420 --> 42:32.700
so

42:32.700 --> 42:39.260
Yeah, so just I'm we're just kind of this is kind of like be more breezy and holistic because I can't read

42:39.740 --> 42:43.500
All these reviews. Here's a one-star one. It's possible

42:43.500 --> 42:47.660
I just want you to know Justin because I want you to understand the weight of the responsibility that you're currently bearing

42:47.660 --> 42:50.540
there's a very good chance that there are

42:52.060 --> 42:56.980
Many many people listening this right now for him this 19 year old movie

42:57.140 --> 43:00.900
This is their first time being aware of it

43:01.260 --> 43:06.060
Probably not the master of this. This is from this is one star from 2020 the master disguise

43:06.060 --> 43:08.060
This might as well be called how not to make a movie

43:08.340 --> 43:11.620
This film is yet when I say it like that

43:11.620 --> 43:14.040
I'm using air quotes because a lot of people do it

43:14.040 --> 43:19.360
You have to say this film is yet another one of the top ten worst movies. I've ever seen

43:19.360 --> 43:24.360
I remember when this film first came out. I was in elementary school back then

43:24.360 --> 43:26.120
I was kind of interested in seeing it

43:26.120 --> 43:31.200
But I've never got around to almost like you're the target audience at that point or even buying it on video

43:31.280 --> 43:34.800
Yep, that was still during the VHS transition DVD era

43:34.800 --> 43:40.620
I never saw it was first released and just over ten years later. I saw it on demand for free

43:40.620 --> 43:44.220
So I thought why not? I think I'll give it a watch. Yeah, and

43:44.940 --> 43:47.180
Then the it goes on from there

43:48.060 --> 43:50.420
for pages upon pages upon pages

43:51.740 --> 43:54.540
Here's a they didn't even like the turtle club scene by the way

43:54.540 --> 43:56.580
That sucks one thing to point out

43:56.580 --> 44:03.460
The most popular scene is the turtle club scene that supposedly is supposed to be the come comedic highlight

44:03.460 --> 44:08.140
It appeared the most frequent all the commercials and trailers believe me

44:08.140 --> 44:12.700
I know but when I watched it, I was very disappointed big shock

44:12.860 --> 44:19.100
It's nothing but Dana Carvey who plays the main character pistachio disguise II know seriously, that's his name

44:19.700 --> 44:23.300
Spoiler before before I tear apart Dana Carvey's performance

44:23.300 --> 44:30.000
I just want to say one thing and this person goes on and on and on here's here's um, here's here's a here's a one-star

44:30.520 --> 44:32.520
from 2005 all

44:32.540 --> 44:35.860
Data what goodness name were you thinking? Oh

44:35.860 --> 44:37.860
My

44:38.500 --> 44:40.500
Was this a stinker I

44:41.140 --> 44:47.780
Tried to give as much of a chance as possible because you cannot believe everything you read from critics and

44:48.180 --> 44:55.300
You cannot believe everything you hear with the master. This guy's everything you taste you can oh, this is awful

44:55.300 --> 44:58.080
I don't really think they meant it to be awful

44:58.080 --> 45:05.040
We haven't yet tried to make a movie here at McElroy brothers HQ

45:05.040 --> 45:08.120
But I don't think a lot of you were like, hey, let's really fuck this one up

45:08.120 --> 45:13.680
Oh like in a fun way in like the room or like a bad like the scary movie movies. Nah. Nah. Nah. No, let's just do a

45:13.680 --> 45:15.120
shit job

45:15.120 --> 45:17.120
Man, I know

45:17.120 --> 45:20.720
I don't think they meant it to be awful. I mean the story sounded good

45:21.080 --> 45:26.980
I'm sure on paper to a bunch of film executives who are drunk at the time

45:26.980 --> 45:29.200
they heard it then it probably got a

45:29.200 --> 45:36.200
By a bunch of other folks in various forms of development who thought this could really be a silly little film that would catch on

45:36.200 --> 45:38.200
But it wasn't and didn't

45:38.800 --> 45:42.880
In some other universe. I wish there was a better script to punch up the story

45:42.960 --> 45:47.400
But they're relied too much on Dana's characters that were god-awful and unfunny

45:47.560 --> 45:53.320
This movie was painful to watch painful to see talented people on a film in a very untalented movie

45:53.320 --> 45:57.280
Someone should have pulled the plug cease production for a decade

45:58.040 --> 46:04.840
Something anything but here we are. This film is a major pass under any circumstance

46:04.840 --> 46:07.200
That's fucking me like they're just being mean

46:07.200 --> 46:13.280
It's this one's this one's just mean and I feel like we should like look like a better one

46:13.280 --> 46:17.520
I also just say that like maybe I don't know if this is the thing that people do

46:17.520 --> 46:21.360
But maybe we like the three of us could do a punch-up pass on it now post-production

46:21.360 --> 46:26.000
Post-production way post written 19 years post-production 19 years later. We could do our own

46:26.120 --> 46:30.320
That's something to think about let's put that on the sticker board while I read this one from Jerome

46:30.320 --> 46:36.360
But this is from 2004 the best impression ever ten out of ten stars. Nice. All right good. Come on guys

46:36.360 --> 46:42.120
This movie's great. It has about a dozen moments that would make you laugh to death. That's not a lot. Holy shit

46:42.520 --> 46:44.520
Holy fuck Wow

46:44.520 --> 46:46.520
Oh

46:49.440 --> 46:51.440
Like he always dreams

46:54.200 --> 46:56.280
Then Carvey's a fantastic comedian

46:56.280 --> 47:01.380
He does a lot of impressions in the picture that make the movie worth a of a higher grade about a seven

47:01.380 --> 47:04.440
I'd say now this is from person who did just give it ten out of ten stars

47:04.640 --> 47:08.360
So maybe they're just trying to write the ship a little bit cool and the scene from Jaws

47:08.960 --> 47:13.000
Almost made me wait what holy shit. They just cut a scene from Jaws

47:13.000 --> 47:16.120
I've never seen this movie, but I didn't know you could just do that

47:17.200 --> 47:22.900
Also the actress that shares the screen with Dana Carvey as well as Brent mr. Data spider

47:23.160 --> 47:29.960
Made a good supporting career that way you couldn't go ahead and find out her name their reviewer the actress that's really green

47:29.960 --> 47:35.840
And now yeah, you're you're hey you're on IMDB right now. I know it

47:37.440 --> 47:41.540
I believe most people thought this should be a more serious comedy

47:41.540 --> 47:46.440
Wait more intellectual what but no, it's just simple and good jokes

47:47.000 --> 47:50.680
Come on. You guys should evaluate this movie better funny

47:51.480 --> 47:55.680
Very funny movie. Okay, cool. Hey, I have a

47:56.440 --> 48:00.880
Widescreen monitor and I have to as I want to do when I'm cruising the net

48:00.880 --> 48:04.160
I have it split in half where one half is one

48:05.560 --> 48:09.280
Google Chrome window and the other half is the as another Google Chrome window

48:09.280 --> 48:16.760
And but I have just sort of absentmindedly I now have the Wikipedia page for the Master of Disguise open on both halves

48:18.760 --> 48:20.760
You just

48:21.560 --> 48:28.400
Two of them can I read the last line and about the post-credits scene in Master of Disguise, it's good spoilers everyone

48:28.400 --> 48:31.840
Oh, yeah, there's by the way master disguise. There's three

48:32.440 --> 48:38.200
Awesome three post-credits. That's good. Well, here's one of them a spoiler skip ahead 30 seconds

48:38.200 --> 48:41.520
If you don't want to I'm just gonna read it verbatim in a post-credits scene

48:41.960 --> 48:47.320
Pistachio discovers that the slappy dummy which he used earlier in the film has a little man inside

48:47.320 --> 48:52.680
They proceed to chase and slap each other but later share a drink together before saying goodbye to the audience

48:58.920 --> 49:00.920
Sounds like a good film I'd like to see

49:01.200 --> 49:05.320
All right. All right good bit over 50 thought it was super funny

49:05.320 --> 49:08.640
Dan and Carvey is brilliant see him as a turtle and try not to laugh

49:08.860 --> 49:15.680
He does Al Pacino as a Saturday Night Fever dancer who flips all over the other crowd cannot understand this movie

49:15.680 --> 49:20.080
But we thought it was hilarious. That's awesome. Do you think he was still chant like riding that 9-eleven way?

49:20.360 --> 49:23.200
But they recorded that scene too. Do you think he used it?

49:26.680 --> 49:29.800
Part of it. I wonder if they took a break for a few hours. I

49:29.800 --> 49:35.280
Mean they they had they shot this thing in like a three-week shoot like it was tight

49:35.320 --> 49:37.400
So like they did not have time to really process

49:38.080 --> 49:40.080
What had happened?

49:40.480 --> 49:43.040
So he had to use it, you know, what other choice did he have?

49:43.040 --> 50:06.720
That's a good bit there's no cursing by the way awesome you didn't ask I just got slapped in the fucking face

50:06.720 --> 50:08.720
I'm a turtle

50:11.080 --> 50:12.080
So, yeah

50:12.080 --> 50:12.600
No

50:12.600 --> 50:16.500
It's also because it is also easy to remember what year

50:16.720 --> 50:22.880
anniversary you are in with the master of skies like I know without you thinking about this is the 20th anniversary of

50:23.400 --> 50:26.960
Master of the skies being released in theaters. Hmm, like today

50:27.640 --> 50:30.600
Not the best definitely not the worst. Okay

50:30.600 --> 50:38.920
Um, should we do at least one more question you think? Yeah. Cool. Yep. Yep. Is it sort of master disguise theme? Yeah

50:40.320 --> 50:41.840
All right, I'm ready then

50:41.840 --> 50:44.480
I'm a nanny for a nine-year-old who was just going back to school

50:44.920 --> 50:49.400
Last year the bus driver called me by my college's name as a nickname. Hey

50:50.080 --> 50:52.080
insert school name here

50:52.280 --> 50:58.280
But I have since graduated and grab the this year the bus driver has taken just called me the graduate

50:58.280 --> 51:03.760
Which is significantly worse in my opinion. How do I get this nine-year-olds bus driver to give me a cooler nickname?

51:03.760 --> 51:09.880
That's from vexed in Virginia. That's awesome. Yeah, that's awesome. That kicks ass the graduate

51:09.880 --> 51:16.680
Are you fucking kidding me? I would give anything if you are a highly paid assassin the graduate be an amazing. Oh, yeah

51:16.680 --> 51:21.800
Oh, you don't want to be the graduate is after you. Oh, you're fucked here come here comes

51:21.800 --> 51:26.880
But they bail obviously based this on you were wearing a shirt or something with your costume

51:26.880 --> 51:29.180
A shirt or something with your college's name on it?

51:29.180 --> 51:35.280
Like that's where this came out of so like be grateful that they got there with such little information, right?

51:35.840 --> 51:40.220
Yeah, because they wouldn't just be like, oh here comes the sandwich eater because they saw you

51:41.720 --> 51:46.480
Yeah, they were like, oh here comes mr. Dooley's clown college for sinners. Yeah

51:49.360 --> 51:51.360
Now you're the graduate

51:51.360 --> 51:55.400
That's great, man. The problem is the bus driver doesn't have more information about you

51:55.400 --> 52:01.680
You should just start giving that bus driver more information about you. Oh, yes all your information social security

52:02.520 --> 52:03.920
address

52:03.920 --> 52:08.560
Give them all your needs. He's just trying this is a new way people have it's a new phishing scam

52:08.560 --> 52:13.660
Right where the the Fisher makes you want to give them your personal information. Yeah, you could be

52:13.660 --> 52:16.420
Oh, here comes fucking point dexter glasses neater

52:17.080 --> 52:21.360
Cuz you were got it because you are you wear glasses and I assume you need them

52:21.360 --> 52:27.160
That's all I know about you point dexter glasses neater. Here's what I know about the school bus. Yeah

52:27.760 --> 52:31.040
They there they have two jobs one

52:31.880 --> 52:35.520
safely ferry children from corners to school

52:36.320 --> 52:41.000
Second try to lure adults onto the bus, huh? Because it's so embarrassing

52:41.000 --> 52:47.320
Oh, I see. It's like you basically get like 20 points for every adult that you can lure on the way. What do you do?

52:47.320 --> 52:51.600
Oh, what fuck yeah headed downtown hop aboard just kidding more

52:51.600 --> 52:55.760
This is a regular bus and by the time you're like already walking up the steps like wait a minute

52:55.760 --> 53:02.320
This seems like it's full of kids. Whoa, and you're already halfway to school if they bring you to the the bus depot

53:02.560 --> 53:07.200
Then they get 20 points for every adult that they've ordered the bus and you have to walk home

53:07.440 --> 53:12.160
They'll know if you try to get an uber don't you have to start school over from whatever

53:12.440 --> 53:16.800
Is like the youngest grade of the school that they brought subjects of Billy Madison

53:16.800 --> 53:21.760
Do you got do you guys ever wonder cuz bus drivers the school bus drivers?

53:21.760 --> 53:23.840
They pick up the kids in the morning drop the kids off at school

53:24.240 --> 53:26.920
Then they pick up the kids at school and they drop the kids off at home

53:27.360 --> 53:29.960
Yeah, you summed it up pretty well. What's that window in between?

53:31.240 --> 53:37.280
What about school bus drivers doing? Well Travis they're training and I know what you're wondering for what?

53:38.760 --> 53:40.760
On ways to lure more

53:41.400 --> 53:44.920
Their passion they do it for the love of the game. You know what I mean?

53:44.920 --> 53:51.480
I think that there should be like a school bus right between the hours of let's say like 9 and 2

53:52.440 --> 53:59.160
They can give rides to adults right and the end no penalty there, right? That's fine. Oh, whoa

54:00.280 --> 54:07.640
What if there was a different like Lyft and uber but it was only between like 830 and 230, uh-huh

54:07.640 --> 54:15.040
I call a bus like a bus and you like roll up and it's like yeah

54:15.160 --> 54:21.440
This is my web. It's a school. We just saved a lot of musical programs in elementary school

54:21.440 --> 54:27.240
Yeah, oh man. It says there's a fucking 13-minute wait for an uber. We're gonna we're gonna miss our flight

55:34.400 --> 55:36.880
Don't put that in the app. It's kind of like an off-label

55:37.800 --> 55:41.500
One of the actual review options is let me drove drive the bus

55:41.600 --> 55:45.400
They did let me drive the bus and if you pick that I do get fired immediately

55:45.400 --> 55:50.760
So don't it's a trap. That's a trap review option. So please don't you have to pay an extra five bucks to smoke in the back?
