00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:50.080
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening? Hey, welcome, folks. This is my brother,

00:50.080 --> 00:52.960
my brother and me in an advice show for the Monterey. We're just heating up for the holiday

00:52.960 --> 00:58.640
season. Are we already on that creep? We are on it. We're going to record our Christmas episode

00:58.640 --> 01:05.600
now and then you save it. Promise you don't listen to it until then. Now, every episode is going to

01:05.600 --> 01:12.000
be a Christmas episode. We love getting into the spirit. My argument is if Starbucks has got a red

01:12.000 --> 01:19.840
cup, I've got the light of Jesus's birth in my heart. That is my one to one. Do not look directly

01:19.840 --> 01:26.400
at that birth. That was very bright, but it's like a flash bang. And unfortunately, if Starbucks has

01:26.400 --> 01:32.880
a white cup, we're empty and soulless inside. Yeah. Who's hollow? Who? I don't know. Tell me,

01:32.880 --> 01:39.920
Starbucks. Only Starbucks remembers Jesus. Only Starbucks. You can get a CD up at the checkout.

01:40.720 --> 01:47.360
You want Buble? You want Buble or you want Jeezu? You know, Buble is putting out a Christmas album.

01:47.360 --> 01:57.040
It's a game changer. It's Jeezu and it's Nora Jones together again. Oh, Jesus. I do miss him.

01:57.600 --> 02:03.120
This is an advice show for the modern era. We are on our holiday creep, on the Christmas creep,

02:03.120 --> 02:11.920
a slow death march to the birth of Jesus. And then to 2012 and then it's all over. And then in

02:11.920 --> 02:17.600
2012, Ragnarok. It's going to be great. But for now, we still have a lot of people that need our

02:17.600 --> 02:24.560
help. And we're going to be here with you until Quetzalcoatl unhinges his jaw, until he swallows

02:24.560 --> 02:30.960
this world whole. And we will be probably live streaming that when that event happens. But for

02:30.960 --> 02:36.640
right now, Quetzalcoatl takes our torsos from us. Yeah, flies them into heaven. Give that back.

02:36.640 --> 02:42.960
Hey, hey, I was using that torso Quetzalcoatl. God, I hope I'm pronouncing that wrong.

02:44.880 --> 02:50.960
It's so key. Hey, I'm a married 30 year old dude with two young ones, self-employed,

02:50.960 --> 02:55.920
good at projects, completing projects on my own. I want to do a little self-improvement,

02:55.920 --> 03:00.800
eat better, spend less money on junk food, lose the gut, stop biting my nails, etc.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.680
But I always fail to follow through on any self-improvements I want to make.

03:03.680 --> 03:11.120
Hey, where do I get the willpower to follow through on making a better me? Willis in Watertown.

03:12.880 --> 03:21.280
You know how to do it. Yeah, they actually sell willpower now in different ways. You just got to

03:21.280 --> 03:27.680
seek it. You got to seek it out. Like, for instance, I've been really bad about taking

03:27.680 --> 03:34.320
my vitamins every day. So yesterday I went to the Walgreens and I bought new vitamins.

03:34.960 --> 03:42.080
I bought some Genesis Today immunity boosting super fruit gummies and some fish oil. And I

03:42.080 --> 03:47.520
bought one of those seven day sort of like one of those Advent calendars, but for old people who

03:47.520 --> 03:52.640
forget to take their medicine. Yes. And now I put my vitamins in that. Wait, hold on a second. Are

03:52.640 --> 04:00.160
you telling me that you, my 17 year old little brother, is rocking a pill caddy? Yeah, I got a

04:00.160 --> 04:04.880
pill caddy. You have a pill caddy? It's sleek and it's stylish. I picked the one that had this

04:06.160 --> 04:12.880
font that's now. That's now and today. Do you find it difficult finding a place to keep that

04:12.880 --> 04:19.920
on your rascal? Did you pick the one? When you picked it, did you consider your children or

04:19.920 --> 04:26.720
perhaps your children's children reluctantly throwing it away after you die? Oh, he didn't

04:26.720 --> 04:31.920
take Sundays. Look, look at this. This Saturn is the last one he took. I hate to throw it away,

04:31.920 --> 04:38.960
but listen, Pea Paw's not in that pill caddy. He's up in heaven. Listen, you look at that

04:38.960 --> 04:44.240
pill caddy and you think this is an 80 year old man, but you pop it, you pop that treasure chest

04:44.240 --> 04:49.440
and you see those immunity boosting super fruit gummies from Genesis Today. You know that this is

04:49.440 --> 04:54.000
a young man's game. You know what? I want to get one of those pill caddies now and just fill it

04:54.000 --> 04:59.680
with jelly bellies. These are Tuesday's jelly bellies. If you don't have a pill caddy now,

04:59.680 --> 05:05.200
you're not going to live to need one. Are you guys taking your super fruit?

05:06.320 --> 05:11.440
I don't know what you're saying. How do you feel about acai?

05:11.440 --> 05:17.920
Uh, I, I feel like you're super fruit gummies. It sounds like they might have

05:18.640 --> 05:24.320
gelatin in it or, or, or some other animal based product. And that's against my lifestyle. So

05:24.320 --> 05:28.480
just as a sign that to the people at home know when Griffin says he's super fruit gummies,

05:29.200 --> 05:33.760
he's talking about sour patch kids. He doesn't know any better. Yeah. We told him that those

05:33.760 --> 05:38.400
are long time ago. We told them those are super fruit gummies. If you hear them talk about eating

05:38.400 --> 05:44.400
the red ones, make me strong. Strong. If you hear him talk about eating a health sponge,

05:44.400 --> 05:50.400
that's a Twinkie. What you got right there. He does not know full of life cream. What?

05:51.200 --> 05:56.800
Life cream. That's life cream. No, don't say that. Look at the energy meat on a super bun.

05:56.800 --> 06:02.800
That's a big Mac. Yeah. That is a hamburger eating there. As far as like finding the willpower to do

06:02.800 --> 06:08.560
it. I like to surround myself with friends that will just like reach out and poke my, my muffin

06:08.560 --> 06:14.640
tops and just be like, Hey, you look fat. You look fat today and I'll get you out there running.

06:14.640 --> 06:22.160
The problem is you're, you're trying to fix too much because if you're trying to fix four things,

06:22.160 --> 06:27.120
then when your willpower falters, you're going to let one of them go and think, well,

06:27.120 --> 06:32.240
I'm going to jettison this, but I'll keep the other things. It's like, like a, you know,

06:32.240 --> 06:37.280
like take it on water, right? You're going to bail something over through your, through your, uh,

06:37.280 --> 06:43.120
stop biting my nails boudoir over the edge of the Titanic, just so you could preserve the lose the

06:43.120 --> 06:53.840
gut, uh, uh, armoire. Um, so you gotta pick one thing and stick with it. And you got to set a

06:53.840 --> 07:00.640
reward, a goal for yourself. Say if I lose these 30 pounds or whatever it is, I want to buy myself

07:00.640 --> 07:06.240
a shredding electric guitar. Yeah. You know, something I can, like Stevie Ray Vaughan,

07:06.240 --> 07:10.880
I guess RV would rock. And then you got to stick to it and you can't be like, well, three pounds,

07:10.880 --> 07:14.560
well, I'm still getting my guitar. I'm going to get a 10th of a guitar. You can't work that way.

07:14.560 --> 07:18.960
It's not going to be any good to you. You just got the bridge. Health is all about tricking yourself

07:18.960 --> 07:25.040
and thinking these horrible, horrible things you have to do to keep yourself from dying are really

07:25.040 --> 07:31.680
fun. That's why I'm down with that fitocracy jam. It turns like exercise and they're like an RPG.

07:31.680 --> 07:38.240
And it's like, you get 10 constitution and also no diabetes. Now exercise is a constant battle

07:38.240 --> 07:46.240
to realize that the extension of your life by five or 10 years is still, it is infinitesimal

07:46.240 --> 07:51.600
in the grand scheme of things. The universe has been around for millions of years. You're 60

07:51.600 --> 07:57.280
years, bumping it up to 70, convincing yourself like that matters is the secret behind exercise.

07:57.280 --> 08:02.880
If you guys can figure that out, well, please, by all means, you host this show. Cause I don't know.

08:02.880 --> 08:09.600
Uh, you know, psychologically, you can't look past giving yourself a gold star chart. Like it's very

08:09.600 --> 08:14.720
childish, but man, it works. It feels good to slap a gold star up on the wall. It feels good to empty

08:14.720 --> 08:19.840
a caddy. You guys need to get down with my way of living. I'm telling you, it feels good when you

08:19.840 --> 08:23.920
remember like, Oh, it's Tuesday, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. Nothing better than a clean caddy.

08:23.920 --> 08:30.880
Oh, is that what it sounds like? The sound effects probably help. Get as many gummies as you can.

08:30.880 --> 08:37.520
Cause they're the new thing. They're new. They're what's now. They're super fruit. Get healthy. Uh,

08:37.520 --> 08:42.800
Hey brothers, there's this girl I met in my college class. I really like her. Um, that sounds

08:42.800 --> 08:48.000
like something somebody would say who doesn't really go to college. I met her at a college

08:48.000 --> 08:53.760
class. We had all the other football studs. We're working on our mathers. Okay. So I really like

08:53.760 --> 08:59.040
her. She seemed really into me and she asked for my number. We've been texting for about three weeks.

08:59.040 --> 09:03.360
Then I found out she has a boyfriend. She constantly goes on about how awesome and funny I

09:03.360 --> 09:08.400
am. And we've hung out a few times as well as going out to eat. She's even told me the last

09:08.400 --> 09:12.320
time we went out that her and her BF were having some fights and might break up. Is this the way

09:12.320 --> 09:19.840
boys and girls act as friends in real life? Or is she lining me up for after love struck in the US?

09:19.840 --> 09:26.720
She, she is playing pool with hearts. Yeah. She's heart pool. You got your eight ball lined up over

09:26.720 --> 09:32.480
your quarter pocket, but she got to sink that four ball first. So she's shooting that four ball

09:32.480 --> 09:40.800
in a manner that will leave the queue lined up to sink the eight. At best she is lining you up

09:40.800 --> 09:46.640
for after she wakes up with her boyfriend. At worst, she is using you to feel better about the

09:46.640 --> 09:51.360
fact that she is having fights with her boyfriend. Oh God, she's doubling down. She's a poker

09:51.360 --> 09:57.600
metaphor. Yeah. And at both, you are on the short end of this particular relationship step, my

09:57.600 --> 10:06.400
friend. You are a pawn in this game. Why do people ask us the questions that it would solve their

10:06.400 --> 10:13.600
problem to ask the other person? Yeah. Listen, just take this copy and paste it and sext it over to

10:13.600 --> 10:18.880
her. Just send it like, Hey, what's up? What is the question and a picture of my dick? Just real

10:18.880 --> 10:27.600
quick. Give you a full picture. I'll give you a scope of the situation. There's a rat. This is

10:27.600 --> 10:32.880
one of those things. Okay. I think a new, a new good yardstick for problems is if you're not

10:32.880 --> 10:37.840
comfortable asking the person this question, there's a problem. Yeah. Like if you are having

10:37.840 --> 10:43.600
this doubt that you aren't comfortable bringing up with the other person, it's bad times. It's a

10:43.600 --> 10:50.480
bad scene at that very best. You're you, you are emotionally cuckolding this gentleman. Yeah. You

10:50.480 --> 10:56.640
don't want to be that guy. You don't want to be the, the, the Mr. Mr. Consolation or Mr. You know,

10:56.640 --> 11:03.520
you're not, you're, you're not a solution. You know, you're not the, the, the fix all to all of

11:03.520 --> 11:10.480
life's problems. You're just a guy trying to make his way. Especially because it is a, is a trap to

11:10.480 --> 11:16.800
be the better than the boyfriend guy. Oh yeah. One, you're setting yourself up on a pedestal and

11:16.800 --> 11:22.240
she's like, you know, she's sitting, this guy is great. Why isn't my boyfriend more like him? He's

11:22.240 --> 11:25.840
great. And then you're a normal guy, just like everyone else. You got problems, you got problems,

11:25.840 --> 11:30.400
you got shortcomings, just like everyone else. You're not better than this guy. You're just

11:30.400 --> 11:36.880
different from that guy. And then two, she has a boyfriend. Like, do you really want to be with

11:36.880 --> 11:42.320
someone that is with someone else and wanting to date you? Like that doesn't bode well for the

11:42.320 --> 11:48.080
future. Yeah. That's the troubling thing about her character, I think. But you might be reading too

11:48.080 --> 11:52.320
much into it. Maybe she's not seeing the situation this way. It sounds like she, she is, but of

11:52.320 --> 11:56.400
course you've only got your perspective, so it's hard to say. Why don't you pump the brakes?

11:56.400 --> 12:00.720
Pump them. And then if she breaks up with her boyfriend, then you can pick back up on this

12:00.720 --> 12:05.600
storyline. But for right now, there's too much going on that you probably don't want to be a

12:05.600 --> 12:09.600
part of. You might even let her know that and say, Hey, I think you're great and I have a really

12:09.600 --> 12:13.920
great time with you, but until this whole boyfriend situation gets worked out, I think we should just

12:13.920 --> 12:18.880
be friends and cool it, you know, with like the going out and hanging out and stuff like that.

12:18.880 --> 12:23.360
I, that's not going to work though. Cause he really likes her. You can't be friends with

12:23.360 --> 12:28.560
someone you really like. First he has to really like himself. You gotta, you gotta just, there's

12:28.560 --> 12:34.240
no way that this situation can unfold. That's not going to end with Joey Greco kicking down your

12:34.240 --> 12:42.080
door. Like, Hey, Hey, I knew all along. Gotcha. On his show. Gotcha. You know, if you go into

12:42.080 --> 12:47.600
this relationship and you, you are going in as the guy, she left the other guy for it,

12:47.600 --> 12:54.720
your bar is going to be way high right out of the gate. I, I believe personally that the first two

12:54.720 --> 13:00.720
weeks of your relationship should be the equivalent of signing a release form before you bungee jump.

13:00.720 --> 13:06.080
As if to say, if you are still here, you fully understand the risks that you are taking on in

13:06.080 --> 13:11.040
this, in this situation. It should be the very worst of you. And if she's still there,

13:11.040 --> 13:17.600
nowhere to go but up, but on ramp onto the highway, the opportunity to like swerve into the shoulder.

13:17.600 --> 13:21.120
Lady, this is the highway to disappointment. And you should probably just pull off and

13:22.560 --> 13:25.840
stop at that freshest big boy and dry your sorrows in a cup of mud.

13:29.520 --> 13:35.040
This coffee is good, by the way, I'm having some coffee of my own. Um, I, I really do think that

13:35.040 --> 13:42.400
this is one of those situations where you're going to save yourself so much heartache. Yeah. By just

13:42.400 --> 13:48.880
having the conversation, just, you gotta be. So it's so adult and mature to have that conversation.

13:48.880 --> 13:52.480
I think it makes you look really good. If you don't approach it like, bitch, you playing me?

13:52.480 --> 13:56.160
If you're like, hey, listen, let's. Well, no. I'm sorry. Approach it like what?

13:57.360 --> 14:00.320
I said what I said. How do you think? Yeah, we all heard.

14:00.320 --> 14:03.440
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

14:05.680 --> 14:12.480
I'm just, I'm disappointed in Travis. I am as well. I too am disappointed in my performance.

14:14.640 --> 14:23.520
Um, you got to run away, run away from a baby because it's going to hurt. It's going to hurt.

14:23.520 --> 14:28.640
Even if you come to her and have a combo, how's that combo? Cause it's going to be pretty bad.

14:28.640 --> 14:32.720
It's going to be rough for you. Going to be rough for her. You've realized the situation. You see

14:32.720 --> 14:38.400
this train just screaming towards you. You don't try to have a convo with the train. Like, Hey,

14:38.400 --> 14:44.640
would you mind? Oh, you gingerly step off the tracks and then run away. Right. There is,

14:44.640 --> 14:48.880
there is the possibility with the conversation option that you start to have the conversation.

14:48.880 --> 14:54.640
She says, um, I have no idea what you're talking about. Yeah. Or she says, Oh, but I don't. And

14:54.640 --> 15:02.960
then she pulls out a boob and then you're sunk. You're sunk. That's always a danger. Sure.

15:04.320 --> 15:08.880
So maybe this is a situation if you just go into it and keep your wits about you and keep your head

15:08.880 --> 15:14.000
on a swivel and you know that there might be some shady business going on. Like you're already leaps

15:14.000 --> 15:19.600
and bounds like ahead of everyone else. So if you go into this going, this could turn out badly.

15:19.600 --> 15:27.120
I need to protect myself here and just be careful. You know, maybe it'll end up being great and true

15:27.120 --> 15:35.120
love and awesome. I really feel like this is one area where our, uh, you know, our past of arranging

15:35.120 --> 15:41.200
marriages and the very sort of direct way that those situations were handled. Like the one sort

15:41.200 --> 15:49.200
of leg up it has on our modern system is that by our sort of modern etiquette, there's not even a

15:49.200 --> 15:54.160
way to have a con. It's like getting an actor's equity card. Like you can't get into an equity

15:54.160 --> 15:58.000
show without a card, but you can't get the card unless you're in one of the shows. That's what,

15:58.000 --> 16:02.320
like, that's the sort of position we've painted ourselves into with relationships these days.

16:02.320 --> 16:11.120
Like you're, you're, we're so, uh, used to sort of like our online interactions and, and, and,

16:11.120 --> 16:16.960
and, you know, disassociating through texts and stuff like that, that we've lost that very basic

16:16.960 --> 16:20.960
ability to go to somebody and say, Hey, I'm going to have this conversation with you face to face.

16:20.960 --> 16:25.440
And I miss that, that, that's something that business-like sort of, uh, you know,

16:26.000 --> 16:32.160
I would like to court you. We are courting now. I'm I, you can either my pen here is my written.

16:32.160 --> 16:36.720
Please sign this document. Griffin, do you have a Yahoo question? A Yahoo answer that you could

16:36.720 --> 16:43.280
take? I have five. Yeah. Read all of them back to back to back to back to back. Okay, here we go. Um,

16:43.280 --> 16:51.600
this Yahoo was, uh, this Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holifield. Thank you, Lisa. It's by Yahoo

16:51.600 --> 17:00.000
answers user Matt L who asks cool band names for metal band. My band has been wanting to do a show

17:00.000 --> 17:05.680
for some time now, but we have one small problem. We can't think of a good band name. We are a metal

17:05.680 --> 17:11.840
death metal band and our songs are original. Please help. Mercury.

17:11.840 --> 17:18.640
Travis has mercury. Justin, do you have any other Greek gods slash planets that you want to drop?

17:18.640 --> 17:24.880
I was actually going for a metallic, uh, substance. You clever fuck. I know, right?

17:24.880 --> 17:31.840
God, that's good. Yeah. It's really juicy. It's a really, it's a really juicy vein of comedy.

17:31.840 --> 17:40.080
You struck a real nice vein. Uh, these laws go 10 feet deep.

17:43.200 --> 17:48.320
You know what helps, uh, any joke? If the person has to have a rudimentary understanding of, uh,

17:48.320 --> 17:53.280
the chemical table before they, they, uh, laugh at it. Yeah. Yeah. Which in this,

17:53.280 --> 17:58.320
this day and age, most people do, I would say breaking bad. Everybody knows most of the symbols

17:58.320 --> 18:04.640
now. It is not at all called the chemical table. What the fuck is it called? Periodical table of

18:04.640 --> 18:12.800
elements. You idiot child. Are you sure it's periodical and not periodic? It's periodical.

18:12.800 --> 18:21.280
Sometimes it's there. Sometimes it's not. It's a magazine table of magazines. This is a show for

18:21.280 --> 18:28.880
stupids. Like where it's made by. For and by. For and by dumbos. Uh, do you guys want to hear some

18:28.880 --> 18:39.120
of the responses that Yahoo has provided? Yeah, I do. Uh, says glass rose, guilty witness,

18:39.120 --> 18:45.920
guilty witnesses, unfortunate, unfortunate residents. Holy sins. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Unfortunate

18:45.920 --> 18:52.960
residents. This, I love this apartment. The, the, the, the roofing is just terrible. There is,

18:53.760 --> 19:00.400
there is blood everywhere. Yeah. How unfortunate residents. It's great. Our neighbors are very

19:00.400 --> 19:09.280
noisy. Um, holy sins, flesh deep Saturn nine. Well flush deep. He's just combining two things

19:09.280 --> 19:14.880
that don't mean the same thing. Also flesh deep. It's not that deep friend. No, but he's saying

19:14.880 --> 19:22.480
like holy sin. Two things together. This is fire. This is great. Rainy sun. Uh, two and a half

19:22.480 --> 19:28.880
blank bodies, knives, idk. Wait, what? Two and a half men? Two and a half men, sure. Two and a

19:28.880 --> 19:36.160
half. That, I think it's a, I think he's saying you should make your death metal band a parody

19:36.160 --> 19:46.000
off two and a half men's name. Two and like two and a half bodies. Um, humanities experiment.

19:46.000 --> 19:52.320
That's okay. It's, it's me. Drew has some really good ones. Oh God. I was hoping that was a man.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.960
It's me. Drew. Hey, it's me. Drew. Time to rock.

19:58.960 --> 20:05.200
And also I need to borrow like 50 bucks. Yeah. It's me. Drew drops club bangers. Like

20:05.200 --> 20:10.960
like gorging through infected city.

20:15.040 --> 20:24.640
The city sucks. Uh, in engaging fate, burning, burning savior, um, gunning down hatred.

20:25.920 --> 20:32.240
Get over here. Hatred falling death metal, like up with the people band. Yeah. We're bringing down

20:32.240 --> 20:41.840
hatred. Time to work it out. Let's have a powwow. Be nice to your dad. Falling into purgatory,

20:42.640 --> 20:50.320
smoke, smoking infection, or maybe smoking infection. Um, what about just trust falls?

20:50.320 --> 21:02.240
How would that be as a death metal man? Ladies and gentlemen, we are hands around the world.

21:02.240 --> 21:12.320
Hell break. Hell break. Oh, it's 10 30. Time for a hell break. That's what hell break is.

21:12.320 --> 21:15.520
What Satan takes every time he goes up to produce a new day. Matthew's band album.

21:15.520 --> 21:22.960
Oh, I'm on a hell break. Just chilling. Hey, I like any band name that when your fans come to

21:22.960 --> 21:29.600
all fans, I use the term loosely when random people wander into the venue and they go,

21:29.600 --> 21:36.400
excuse me, what, what's the name of this gorging through? Okay, cool. What does that mean? I don't

21:36.400 --> 21:43.680
know. Um, but I definitely don't want a t-shirt. I'm sticking around. Excuse me. May I gorge through?

21:43.680 --> 21:52.800
Okay. Your best bet, I think for this particular band is to pick a name that is almost the name

21:52.800 --> 21:57.680
of another metal band so that people will get confused and come see your show. Scuttle of mud.

21:57.680 --> 22:02.560
Yeah. Did you go see Metallica's?

22:05.200 --> 22:11.920
It's the plural. Metallico. I went and saw Spain this weekend. They were awesome.

22:11.920 --> 22:18.080
They did that one song. Fuck. If I could drop a stained parody title right now, that would be

22:18.080 --> 22:27.360
really good. I want to see God. That's good. That's a band, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's a band

22:27.360 --> 22:33.680
that's still relevant that anybody listening to the show knows who it is. I want to go see 411.

22:33.680 --> 22:41.360
They're definitely right. Justin, that is so far from a metal band.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.880
Amber is the color of your blood.

22:51.840 --> 22:58.640
Let's move on. Hey, metal, your whole universe is the fucking pits.

22:58.640 --> 23:05.200
Just a quick side note here before we move on. Your world sucks.

23:05.920 --> 23:11.200
It's an infected city over there. I hate it. I just have to make my opinion here known,

23:11.200 --> 23:16.880
and that is that it's a joke. You're a joke. It's like listening to a 56k modem dial up.

23:20.000 --> 23:27.040
You're a joke. Hey, people say to us, my brother, my brother and me, you guys are good,

23:27.040 --> 23:33.440
and we like our questions that we send in, but why can't some famous people get involved? I want to

23:33.440 --> 23:41.840
hear the quandaries of the superhuman, by which we mean, of course, other hosts of podcasts.

23:43.280 --> 23:49.440
This is part two in our ongoing celebrity feature. This week we have a question from

23:49.440 --> 23:57.200
our dear friends Tim and Simon, who, of course, from the UK host Tim and Simon's Brains Bill. Can

23:57.200 --> 24:02.320
we title this segment of the show Internet Celebrities? They're Just Like Us. Yes, we can.

24:02.320 --> 24:07.280
This is part two of Internet Celebrities. They're Just Like Us with our friends, Tim and Simon.

24:08.080 --> 24:12.800
Greetings, brothers McElroy. Hello from the other side of the Atlantic. We are Tim and Simon. My

24:12.800 --> 24:16.720
name's Simon. And my name is Tim. You may know us from our podcast Tim and Simon's Brains Bill.

24:16.720 --> 24:22.560
We have a quandary for you guys. Yeah. We are only 24 years of age. Yeah, yeah. Lots of people

24:22.560 --> 24:28.160
confuse us for being much older, usually in our mid thirties. Yeah. That's mainly you though.

24:28.160 --> 24:33.600
You've got a face like a withered old man. You're like Benjamin Button in the early stages of his

24:33.600 --> 24:37.920
life. I am. And it doesn't help that I've had a beard since I was born. That's true. That is true.

24:37.920 --> 24:43.760
I was born with a beard. Yeah. I've got no real excuse. I just got a haggard old face. We just

24:43.760 --> 24:48.320
both look a bit older than I is. So what we need is advice from you. So people stop thinking that

24:48.320 --> 24:53.040
we're older than 24. How can we make ourselves appear like 24 year olds and not like middle age

24:53.040 --> 25:00.960
man? Tim and Simon, thank you so much for your question. I think your first problem is your

25:02.320 --> 25:12.400
dialect. Yeah. I think when people think British, they think been around forever. Old news, old

25:12.400 --> 25:19.760
old old empire. Dusty. Dusty, I think maybe even if we can say dusty. People think of Peter O'Toole

25:19.760 --> 25:25.200
like right out the gate. Pretty much every British person is Peter. Peter O'Toole, if you have that

25:25.200 --> 25:33.280
accent. So the first thing you gotta young that up. What are some upcoming ethnicities or regions

25:33.280 --> 25:39.440
that they could maybe emulate the dialects of to get it? I think like at the USA level,

25:39.440 --> 25:43.120
you're just going to sound ridiculous. You're going to sound like the guy from Avatar

25:43.120 --> 25:48.560
because no one can really nail that American sound. No, we're so special. We're very special

25:48.560 --> 25:56.800
is the thing. What about Esperanto? Well, another language. So not exactly. Then they would be,

25:56.800 --> 26:00.080
I mean, there would be hard to understand, which I don't know if you guys agree with this,

26:00.080 --> 26:04.000
but I think that youth culture is very difficult for me to understand. So maybe that's an approach

26:04.000 --> 26:13.440
they can take. Is is is it possible to say things in the English language in a Japanese

26:13.440 --> 26:19.360
dialect without sounding racist? No, no, it's not. Believe me, I've been experimenting with

26:19.360 --> 26:25.040
this for years. After extensive testing on the periodical table, Travis has discovered

26:25.040 --> 26:30.480
that you can you cannot emulate a Japanese accent without not only that, but there are a lot of

26:30.480 --> 26:36.560
Ruby Tuesdays I am no longer welcome at. Hey guys, maybe just maybe just some baggy pants.

26:36.560 --> 26:40.720
What do you think of that? And like an I'm with stupid shirt that points up at your face.

26:40.720 --> 26:48.560
Just sag them out and then an I'm with stupid shirt. Sag it and and maybe can we can we do

26:48.560 --> 26:54.560
can we freshen up those? Nick, can we can Tim become Timmy and Simon become Simmy?

26:54.560 --> 27:03.520
No, welcome to Timmy and Simmy's brain. Spimmy. I think that what always says young get a backpack.

27:05.040 --> 27:10.320
Or that also can say I live with my mom. Maybe a backpack or maybe like a drug addiction.

27:10.320 --> 27:16.240
It's a white. That's pretty young. That's pretty hip. Yeah, kids love that. Beth, Beth, I whenever

27:16.240 --> 27:23.520
I wear a ball cap to a bar, I'm always carded because a ball cap makes me look like not only

27:23.520 --> 27:30.720
a young child, but a young sick child. Like your make a wish was to go to a bar. Yeah,

27:30.720 --> 27:36.880
like you can't drink. You have tuberculosis like I promise I don't know. I don't remember.

27:36.880 --> 27:42.800
One of you has a beard. Man, listen, I know beard is a rockin look, but nothing says

27:43.760 --> 27:49.360
like I'm I'm an old man like a beard unless you unless I'm carded unless you braid it.

27:49.360 --> 27:55.280
Yeah, throw a pigtail on that bitch. Braid it and then start playing violin for Arcade

27:55.280 --> 28:01.120
Fire and you are off to the young races. I have to stop the show right now and ask if Arcade Fire

28:01.120 --> 28:07.840
is the only band that Justin knows exists because every time we talk about young people, it's always

28:07.840 --> 28:12.000
join the Arcade Fire with you. What you're going to want to do is tell people you're a member of

28:12.000 --> 28:17.600
the Polyphonic Spree. Here's the thing with the Arcade Fire. OK, I will tell you that Arcade Fire

28:17.600 --> 28:24.480
I mean, it's great value as a comedy resource for someone who's like myself now 31 years old

28:24.480 --> 28:31.040
and a steady descent into 40 and irrelevance like Arcade Fire. First off, nobody knows who's in it

28:31.040 --> 28:35.600
because there's so many of them. So that's good. It's an unbearably pretentious name that is

28:35.600 --> 28:44.400
inherently kind of funny and two and three. Nobody really knows what instruments are in it, so like

28:44.400 --> 28:49.280
you can pick any instrument and no one's going to call you on it. Do you understand? Justin,

28:49.280 --> 28:54.160
did you just say that their name is funny? Unbearably pretentious, I think is what I said.

28:54.160 --> 29:00.160
Do you not know that it references the 1972 great Arcade Fire? Is that what it references?

29:00.160 --> 29:03.600
Yeah, so many Pac-Man games lost their lives.

29:06.160 --> 29:09.680
And Pac-Man players. That's where the term Pac-Man fever came from.

29:09.680 --> 29:14.240
That's what actually burning up. Yeah, that's actually what Pac-Man fever is literally being

29:14.800 --> 29:19.120
caught ablaze while playing Pac-Man. And the problem is, is they wouldn't stop playing.

29:19.760 --> 29:24.000
No, I haven't. I still have like two lives left. That's actually had no lives left.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.080
That's how he lost Billy Mitchell Sr. That's why he swore to beat every video game.

29:28.080 --> 29:35.520
He literally reached life's kill screen. Yeah, quite literally. So and then he leveled up to

29:35.520 --> 29:43.680
heaven. So make some, uh, make some jokes about arcade games from 1973. That can help.

29:43.680 --> 29:48.160
Young Yup. Tim and Simon. That could be. Maybe get yourself like an 18 year old girlfriend.

29:48.880 --> 29:53.760
Hey, it's been working for, uh, it's been working for George Clooney all these years.

29:53.760 --> 29:58.560
He still looks great. Yeah, look at Hugh Hefter. He is, he is timeless. Oh, that's, that's good.

29:58.560 --> 30:02.960
That's a deep cut to have young metal for old man with young women. You really went out to

30:02.960 --> 30:11.440
the boneyard for that one. Literally out to the boneyard in this case, of course. Um, uh, so guys,

30:11.440 --> 30:18.800
we hope that that helps you, uh, on, uh, and if not, maybe you, uh, should have paid for a question

30:18.800 --> 30:36.240

Hello there. My name is Graham Clark. And I'm Dave Shumka. And together we host a podcast called

33:52.080 --> 33:57.280
Stop Podcasting Yourself. This is a file that you download from the internet and then you listen to

33:57.280 --> 34:02.400
it in your pod. What's that about? You ask. Well, who are you to ask? Who do you think you are? Yeah,

34:02.400 --> 34:08.480
get lost, bozo. We're a couple of standup comedians in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

34:08.480 --> 34:13.680
And every week we bring a guest on the show. Sometimes they're Canadian. Sometimes they're not.

34:13.680 --> 34:18.560
Sometimes they're a ghost. It's like you're sitting in on a friendly afternoon chat. Plus

34:18.560 --> 34:27.360
we're Canadian. So you get a tax break. You can find us on iTunes or online at MaximumFun.org.

34:27.360 --> 34:36.880
Do you guys want a yahoo? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Well, not if you're going to be so shitty about it.

34:36.880 --> 34:44.000
Yes. Why do you always ask like we've ever said no? Just tear right into it. Like a fat kid. Hey,

34:44.000 --> 34:50.240
motherfuckers. It's yahoo time. Like a fat kid eating a health sponge. Just dig right in. In

34:50.240 --> 34:55.760
case anyone is wondering, yahoo time is a great name for a metal band. Yeah, so is brain spill.

34:55.760 --> 35:02.720
We're yahoo serious time. Let's do it. We are the yahoo serious fan club. This one's going to be

35:02.720 --> 35:10.880
timely. This one was sent in by Michael Cornely. Thank you, Michael. It's by yahoo answers user

35:10.880 --> 35:18.720
Jamie who asks, my boyfriend is addicted to Skyrim. Okay, so yesterday my BF got Skyrim,

35:18.720 --> 35:27.680
a random game. First off, Jamie, no. It's a fantasy epic from Bethesda. Learn something.

35:27.680 --> 35:30.960
And ever since he's been playing it so much. Usually if he gets a game, he would just play

35:30.960 --> 35:34.160
it for one or two hours then get bored of it. But he's been playing this thing for at least nine

35:34.160 --> 35:38.000
hours straight now. The only things he would get up from the computer to is to go to the bathroom.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.680
He wouldn't even bother to get food and I was scared that he would starve. So I ordered him

35:41.680 --> 35:45.840
some pizza and then he just ate it by the computer while playing. When I went to bed,

35:45.840 --> 35:50.080
he was still playing. When I woke up this morning, he was still playing. Usually he likes sex at

35:50.080 --> 35:55.120
least twice a day, but he won't leave the computer even to have sex. So since I'm always thinking of

35:55.120 --> 36:01.360
him, I gave him a BJ and the whole time he was still on the computer. I'm so worried. I'm so

36:01.360 --> 36:07.120
worried about him. What should I do? Hey, hey lady, your boyfriend's a goddamn mastermind.

36:07.120 --> 36:13.440
I'm so fucking jealous right now. With the magic, by the virtue of playing this,

36:13.440 --> 36:19.440
he played this video game so hard that you delivered him pizza and blow jobs. What are

36:19.440 --> 36:24.640
you talking about? Whilst playing the game, he was simultaneously playing you.

36:25.200 --> 36:30.320
Right. And he won. Love is the ultimate game. Do you realize how mad you've driven him with,

36:30.320 --> 36:32.160
like, he's driven- With power.

36:32.160 --> 36:36.080
Yeah. You can never retrieve this relationship. It's over.

36:36.080 --> 36:38.080
And while getting a blow job, he was just chanting,

36:42.400 --> 36:48.800
What are you doing, lady? Have you not been in a relationship before? That's not how you get

36:48.800 --> 36:54.960
anything. Here, I got you this pizza. Please be okay. I'm so worried about you.

36:54.960 --> 36:57.040
Please, I got you these blow jobs. You just have to live.

36:58.160 --> 37:02.880
The only way that his life could've been better is if you had said he had figured out a way to

37:02.880 --> 37:06.720
not have to get up to also go to the bathroom. Right. Like, if he had worked out some kind of

37:06.720 --> 37:11.920
complex pulley system. I love my boyfriend so much that I gave him the human centipede.

37:14.720 --> 37:17.920
It was really important to him to- I bought him a chamber pot.

37:17.920 --> 37:20.960
Griffin, can you- Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

37:20.960 --> 37:28.880
What you gotta do is you gotta get a pizza and make a blow job face. I'm not sure how

37:28.880 --> 37:33.920
that part would work. And you put it near him and then you throw it against the wall.

37:33.920 --> 37:37.280
And you say, nope, that's- You throw your face against the wall?

37:38.080 --> 37:43.760
The blow job face pizza against the wall. Griffin, are you on muscle relaxants?

37:44.800 --> 37:52.240
I'm on some sort of relaxant. What you gotta do is you got to get a pizza and spell out the words

37:52.240 --> 37:57.600
blow job? Question mark in pepperonis. And you give that to him. And then right when he's about

37:57.600 --> 38:04.560
to take his first bite, you slap it out of his hand and you say, maybe leave this magical world,

38:04.560 --> 38:09.440
this magical fantasy dragon filled world and come get this sex pizza instead.

38:10.000 --> 38:16.400
Come get this sex pizza. I'm ready. I know that this is in no way what the problem is about,

38:16.400 --> 38:19.920
but I'm actually more worried about this guy because usually when he spends 50 to 60 dollars

38:19.920 --> 38:25.440
on a video game, he plays for an hour and gets bored. Hey, you're wasting your money.

38:25.440 --> 38:31.600
Yeah, dude, are you okay? Like, are you picking shitty games? Are you just like really, really

38:31.600 --> 38:36.960
bored really easily? Griffin, can you read the- I saw this yahoo and someone submitted it. Can you

38:36.960 --> 38:43.760
read the answer that was that was also submitted? The top response? The top response is by McNamara

38:43.760 --> 38:50.160
who says, why can't I get a girlfriend like you? I don't think that's the one I was thinking of.

38:50.160 --> 38:56.080
LMAO, are you for real? You give him BJ while he's playing Skyrim. Try unplugging the computer

38:56.080 --> 39:00.480
and stop feeding him. Eventually he gets hungry. There was someone who said he could not be

39:00.480 --> 39:04.800
addicted because he had only been playing for nine hours. Please just let the man play.

39:06.720 --> 39:12.000
I do like that that she is distracting him with her pizza blow jobs and and she needs-

39:12.000 --> 39:16.960
That's the great concern. There is a rampant problem in this country of people distracting

39:16.960 --> 39:21.760
their boyfriends while playing Skyrim. Hey, I mean, let's get our priorities straight. Those

39:21.760 --> 39:25.600
dark brotherhood contracts aren't going to fulfill themselves, right? You guys don't know, right?

39:26.400 --> 39:31.920
Exactly. I'm I would like to apologize to the non-gaming part of our audience that we just

39:31.920 --> 39:36.480
ostracized. Yeah, we'll move on to something else right now. Whenever I'm over at someone's house as

39:36.480 --> 39:41.920
a guest, I always get uncomfortable about asking to eat their food. Even when it's offered to me,

39:41.920 --> 39:46.320
my instinctive reaction is to politely decline unless everyone is sitting down for dinner.

39:46.320 --> 39:50.480
This does not happen with acquaintances as one might expect, but also when I'm at a good friend's

39:50.480 --> 39:54.320
house or even my girlfriend's place, I will end up going the whole day without eating sometimes

39:54.320 --> 40:00.000
because of this. What am I supposed to do? That's from Hungry Man. You're supposed to eat-

40:00.000 --> 40:05.520
Eat the food! You'll die if you don't! Why are you people doing this to us? You just-

40:05.520 --> 40:10.400
I went away for a weekend and I starved to death. You're supposed to eat the food!

40:10.400 --> 40:16.800
If someone- Okay, if you go into someone's kitchen and you pop it open and start hunting for

40:17.440 --> 40:22.960
gushers and open bags of Doritos, like that sucks. Don't do that. But if someone's like,

40:22.960 --> 40:27.440
hey, do you want some gushers? Yeah. Are you hungry? Can I get you something, my man?

40:28.080 --> 40:35.280
We have such an overabundance in this country that it is a privilege. It is a genuine privilege

40:35.280 --> 40:43.200
to be able to share your abundance with people. It spans all kind of different cultural groups,

40:43.200 --> 40:49.360
but the ability to give someone food and give someone something makes the giver feel good

40:49.360 --> 40:53.280
as well. So it's like, hey man, can I get you something from my home to you? And you're like,

40:53.280 --> 40:59.120
yeah, I'd love a PB&J. And then they're happy to give you a PB&J. That is not always true.

40:59.120 --> 41:05.440
I got to say, I'm sorry, I've never offered gushers to a guest in a manner that wasn't

41:05.440 --> 41:12.640
obligatory. I have never, I have never in good conscience given a man gushers. Never,

41:12.640 --> 41:17.520
never before. Cause I just can't stop thinking about you only, you pay like three bucks for a

41:17.520 --> 41:23.040
box and you only get six packs in the box. So by eating that, the man is eating 50 cents.

41:23.600 --> 41:28.320
Okay. So like for you, Griffin, it balances out like if you're giving them some rice

41:28.320 --> 41:34.080
or like some grain. Yeah. Oh man. Take this Uncle Ben's. It's yours. That's cool. But leave the

41:34.080 --> 41:39.600
gushers, but leave the gushers. Like if you see me going to my kitchen and eat gushers,

41:39.600 --> 41:43.600
I don't want to see you looking at me all doe eyed like, I wish you could offer me some gushers.

41:44.640 --> 41:48.560
You want her to ask for the gushers? I don't even want them to ask. I want them to

41:48.560 --> 41:53.680
respect the privacy of my gushers time. I hate when I get hungry when I have guests over and

41:53.680 --> 41:59.760
I have to eat my secret special food because they always want it. Okay. But that's, that's where the

41:59.760 --> 42:05.680
good balance is for this dude is if someone offers it to you, you don't have to take it,

42:05.680 --> 42:10.640
but you also don't have to say no. I think he needs to respect. And I think he needs to recognize

42:11.280 --> 42:17.040
when the food that person is eating is their special food. If they're, if they go in the

42:17.040 --> 42:22.480
kitchen and start eating some Ritz crackers. Yeah. You can go ahead and ask them to break you off a

42:22.480 --> 42:27.600
piece. But if they get into some fucking vanilla dip pretzel flips, then guess what? Keep your

42:27.600 --> 42:33.840
grubby hands and your mind hands off those flips with a Z. Here, those double dip Oreos you got

42:33.840 --> 42:39.520
there? Yeah. Yes, they're theirs. Yeah, they're mine. I'd prefer it if you leave me in peace.

42:39.520 --> 42:43.200
And don't- Here's the thing. There are very few things that holds true for me, but if I'm eating

42:43.200 --> 42:49.040
some fucking Girl Scout cookie- See? That comes, that comes around once a year, you bitch. Yeah.

42:49.040 --> 42:56.320
Don't, I have a limited supply of my Thin Mints. And don't say that there's no difference between

42:56.320 --> 43:01.840
foods, you bitch. Because there is, there is a difference. There's a difference. Some foods

43:01.840 --> 43:06.160
are special and you need to, you need to keep your hands off. Like for example, you can have

43:06.160 --> 43:10.080
my peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but you better not lay a finger on my Butterfinger.

43:10.080 --> 43:14.880
Right, exactly. And candy bars, they're mine. Please. If there's an, if there's an ad campaign

43:14.880 --> 43:20.320
about somebody trying to get a certain food, you should probably assume that it's not for you

43:20.320 --> 43:24.720
because it's prohibitively expensive. Don't, don't take somebody's tricks. Hey, let me get a- Crazy

43:24.720 --> 43:30.720
guest. Tricks are for me. Let me get a, let me get a dip of that Big League Chew. I don't think so.

43:30.720 --> 43:37.360
I don't think so. I went to Rite Aid to get this. I specifically made a trip just for this.

43:37.360 --> 43:42.240
My solution for Hungry Man is to just never leave the house without a pocket full of gorp.

43:42.240 --> 43:47.440
Just, just, you've always got to be able to carb and protein up with whatever's in your pockets.

43:47.440 --> 43:49.600
A camel back full of like tomato soup.

43:50.880 --> 43:53.760
Like go in those hats with two cans of tomato soup.

43:53.760 --> 43:57.040
You just have to politely find a way to say,

43:58.320 --> 44:05.120
those Gushers look great. I will settle for a toast. Do you have a toast that I can have?

44:05.120 --> 44:08.480
Give me your shittiest food that you hate and will never eat.

44:08.480 --> 44:12.160
Oh, I think that's a good, I think that's a good transition into what someone's like,

44:12.160 --> 44:15.280
Hey, can I get you something? You say, yes. The worst thing you have,

44:15.280 --> 44:19.680
the thing you will never touch. I will take those pickled cherries and I will eat that.

44:20.320 --> 44:25.520
Yeah. I got some pickled cherries and I got some Zataran's Jambalaya mix that I thought

44:25.520 --> 44:28.400
I would eat, but I don't think I ever will. Do you have any of those?

44:28.400 --> 44:33.200
Half a bag of dry ramen noodles and some Dusseldorf style mustard.

44:34.480 --> 44:35.440
Enjoy.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.440
He was my favorite Harry Potter character.

44:37.440 --> 44:42.480
Style mustard would be a good name for a band.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.920
Actually. Now that I think about it,

44:43.920 --> 44:45.680
we call your heavy metal band style mustard.

44:46.800 --> 44:52.000
Hey, I'm a lady and I'm crushing hard on a guy playing the same rec-

44:52.000 --> 44:52.480
Let him up.

44:54.880 --> 44:58.480
Giantess. We play on the same rec league soccer team.

44:58.480 --> 45:01.040
So we see each other and have friendly chats once a week.

45:01.600 --> 45:05.520
Our team plays late on a week night. So there's no going out for drinks afterwards.

45:05.520 --> 45:11.200
He's single, straight, intuitively dreamy. Can a girl ask out a guy?

45:11.200 --> 45:14.560
I mean, it's 2011, right? That's from crushing in Canada.

45:14.560 --> 45:17.200
Let me answer your question. It is 2011.

45:18.480 --> 45:20.000
If that's your query.

45:20.000 --> 45:27.840
This is sexist almost. Hey, you're a sexist. Of course a girl can ask out a guy. You sexist.

45:29.200 --> 45:32.800
I don't even think that's like a debate question.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.640
Is it? That's what I'm saying.

45:34.640 --> 45:37.920
I don't think you're going to find anybody who goes, no, like, yeah.

45:37.920 --> 45:41.680
Hey, lady, are you not? But lady, are you not laying in on thick enough?

45:42.320 --> 45:45.280
Does he not know? Does he not know? Do you not?

45:45.280 --> 45:49.920
I mean, I am saying that that that anyone can ask anyone out because guess what?

45:49.920 --> 45:52.320
Everyone sucks at it because you either do it and you're like,

45:52.320 --> 45:54.880
could I kiss your boobs or hey, let's do a thing.

45:55.520 --> 46:02.640
Or you're so fucking Rico Suave that you give everyone in like a 15 foot cone in front of you.

46:02.640 --> 46:04.800
Douche chills when you ask someone out.

46:05.360 --> 46:10.720
I guess it's I guess it's more that girls are on the like on point,

46:10.720 --> 46:13.040
like prepared to be asked out by guys.

46:13.040 --> 46:16.640
If you ask a guy out, it might catch him off guard and he will then go home and go.

46:16.640 --> 46:18.400
Did she just ask me out? What was that?

46:18.400 --> 46:21.280
In my experience, the only time I've been able to successfully ask me

46:21.280 --> 46:22.960
was when I catch him off guard.

46:22.960 --> 46:24.720
Surprise is a huge element of it.

46:24.720 --> 46:27.520
Jump out from behind a bush or pop out of the locker.

46:27.520 --> 46:30.160
They can't see it coming. It's gotta be like,

46:30.160 --> 46:32.640
do you want to go out and can you pass the butter?

46:32.640 --> 46:35.440
Because then it's like, yes, yes.

46:35.440 --> 46:37.600
OK, you've got a great.

46:37.600 --> 46:41.600
You've got a great in because you've got you're on a soccer team with him

46:41.600 --> 46:46.320
so you can like dive tackle him and then like accident accidentally,

46:46.320 --> 46:50.480
in quotes, touches balls while you while you both are on the ground.

46:50.480 --> 46:53.200
Although if you're on the same team, I don't know why you dive tackle him.

46:53.920 --> 46:55.440
Oh, because you saw a bee.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.280
You saw a bee and so you dive tackled him.

46:57.280 --> 46:58.800
So wouldn't that work in your day?

46:58.800 --> 47:01.840
OK, but but who can't use the old bee gag?

47:01.840 --> 47:04.640
I'm sorry a bee landed next to you.

47:04.640 --> 47:08.560
You had a bee on your foot and oops, where's my hand?

47:10.400 --> 47:12.160
So that's a good one for guys, too.

47:12.160 --> 47:15.200
Guys, you see a lady out there catches your fancy.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.560
Just go ahead and tackle her.

47:16.560 --> 47:21.120
Just bring her down at her as hard as fast and furious.

47:22.320 --> 47:26.400
Unfortunately, that is limited to it's seasonal because you can't do that in the winter.

47:26.400 --> 47:27.680
Then you have to tackle her and say,

47:27.680 --> 47:29.040
I'm sorry, there was the Yeti.

47:29.040 --> 47:34.320
Yeah, this is no be no be since they are both on a soccer team.

47:34.320 --> 47:37.760
Does the ask does her ask out have to be soccer themed?

47:38.400 --> 47:42.160
She have to say, like, I'm ready for you to.

47:43.600 --> 47:45.760
I'm tired of shin guarding my heart.

47:46.640 --> 47:48.960
I want you to take a penalty shot at my goal.

47:48.960 --> 47:52.320
Yeah, let's go get dinner and then go to the yellow card concert.

47:52.320 --> 47:58.000
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.400
Yellow card is in a thing still.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.280
I actually want to hear.

48:01.280 --> 48:03.200
I don't know that yellow card was ever a thing.

48:03.200 --> 48:06.000
If I could find you now.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.080
Yeah, that was I want to hear Griffin's last breath.

48:08.080 --> 48:11.360
So boring that I will settle for his last question.

48:11.360 --> 48:13.360
When you do a penalty in soccer.

48:13.360 --> 48:14.720
OK, first time you do it.

48:14.720 --> 48:15.200
All right.

48:15.200 --> 48:16.240
And called yellow.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.960
OK, and then the Super Smash Brothers come out.

48:18.960 --> 48:21.920
I wait.

48:21.920 --> 48:23.520
Who are the no bash brothers?

48:23.520 --> 48:23.920
Sorry.

48:23.920 --> 48:24.320
Sorry.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.440
I was going for a mighty dash.

48:25.440 --> 48:27.760
Shut it down by Smash Mouth.

48:30.160 --> 48:31.840
That's a great name for a metal band.

48:31.840 --> 48:33.920
This is everything is happening is the worst thing.

48:34.880 --> 48:38.400
Thank you so much to our friends, Tim and Simon.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.040
You can get there.

48:39.040 --> 48:40.240
Very funny podcast.

48:40.240 --> 48:41.520
Tim and Simon Brain Spill.

48:41.520 --> 48:44.800
That's Tim and Simon dot code dot UK.

48:44.800 --> 48:49.760
Hey, go there and absorb them into your heart,

48:49.760 --> 48:50.720
into your comedy heart.

48:51.280 --> 48:54.000
And I believe they're also on Twitter as well.

48:54.960 --> 48:58.800
But you'll have to go to their website to look that up.

48:58.800 --> 49:00.880
I think they might just be at Tim and Simon.

49:01.520 --> 49:03.520
So give it give them a shot.

49:03.520 --> 49:06.160
I think you'll really enjoy what they're laying down.

49:07.680 --> 49:09.280
We have a new shirt up.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.200
It's at Max fun store dot com.

49:11.200 --> 49:14.800
It is a brown people's nasty gum shirt.

49:14.800 --> 49:16.560
It's it's a real delight.

49:17.360 --> 49:20.320

49:52.880 --> 49:53.680
Yeah, I look really sharp.

49:53.680 --> 49:54.960
On what level?

49:54.960 --> 49:56.960
If you were going to compare it to a celebrity.

49:56.960 --> 49:57.680
Sam Elliott.

49:58.320 --> 49:58.820
Wow.

49:59.680 --> 49:59.920
Yeah.

49:59.920 --> 50:01.920
And you just had that right off the cuff.

50:01.920 --> 50:02.240
Yeah.

50:02.240 --> 50:05.280
Well, it's because I've been told I went to a wedding this past week and they're like,

50:05.280 --> 50:07.840
oh, I didn't know Sam Elliott was going to wait a sec.

50:08.480 --> 50:09.280
Wait a tick.

50:10.480 --> 50:11.280
Yeah, that's a boy.

50:11.280 --> 50:13.040
Mine is more like Elliott from Scrubs.

I want to thank John Roderick, John Roderick and the long winners for the use of their theme song.

50:50.640 --> 50:53.040
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

50:53.520 --> 50:55.120
It's so fucking good.

50:55.120 --> 51:01.120
He's got a new song with Jonathan Colton called nemesis on a JoCo's JoCo's album.

51:07.120 --> 51:08.320
It's so good.

51:08.320 --> 51:11.600
Listen to that and buy that long winter's album and then all the other ones.

51:11.600 --> 51:12.560
Cause they're the best band.

51:13.200 --> 51:13.680
Okay.

51:14.240 --> 51:17.280
And, um, Oh, we got this live show coming up.

51:17.280 --> 51:18.960
I think we've almost got a locale.

51:18.960 --> 51:19.680
Is that accurate?

51:19.680 --> 51:20.000
Griffin?

51:20.000 --> 51:20.560
We do.

51:20.560 --> 51:23.680
Um, I'm going to try, you're going to try and knock it down this week.

51:23.680 --> 51:26.240
It's in Austin, Texas, if you didn't hear last week.

51:26.240 --> 51:30.640
So if you live there, um, let us know, like on Twitter that you're going to go.

51:30.640 --> 51:32.320
So you can sort of gauge it, you know?

51:32.320 --> 51:32.800
Yeah.

51:32.800 --> 51:39.520
Um, and, but listen, when we, I would follow our Twitter feed and, and follow and, and

51:39.520 --> 51:44.000
join our Facebook group because when those tickets go live, there's not going to be a

51:44.000 --> 51:44.960
ton of them.

51:44.960 --> 51:45.520
Yeah.

51:45.520 --> 51:49.120
Um, you want to act fast when those go on sale because there's not, there's not going

51:49.120 --> 51:52.320
to be a, it's not going to be a huge, uh, uh, venue.

51:52.320 --> 51:55.680
So you'll want to act fast when those tickets do go on sale.

51:55.680 --> 51:59.520
Um, anything else?

51:59.520 --> 52:00.400
Forums?

52:00.400 --> 52:02.080
You want to get, you want to add an ad?

52:02.080 --> 52:04.000
You want a personal ad or a corporate ad?

52:04.000 --> 52:08.800
Go to maximumfund.org for slash Jumbotron and we'll set that up for you.

52:08.800 --> 52:12.720
And when you go to the forums, make sure you also check out the other wonderful shows on,

52:12.720 --> 52:18.000
uh, on the maximumfund.org network and their forums and just let them know, you know, I'm

52:18.000 --> 52:20.400
sure you're not going to go listen to stop podcasting yourself.

52:20.400 --> 52:24.720
And when you do make sure that you, uh, go to their forums and tell them that the only

52:24.720 --> 52:26.800
reason you listen to them is because of us.

52:26.800 --> 52:27.200
Yeah.

52:27.200 --> 52:28.880
That's going to make them feel great.

52:28.880 --> 52:31.760
It's going to try them crazy with, with, with envy.

52:31.760 --> 52:33.920
Um, Griffin, I'm ready.

52:34.560 --> 52:37.680
This final Yahoo was, uh, also sent in by Lisa Holifield.

52:37.680 --> 52:38.320
Thank you, Lisa.

52:38.320 --> 52:44.160
It's by Yahoo Answers user IJR who asks, is it considered cheating if you sleep with the

52:44.160 --> 52:46.480
demon that is possessing your wife or girlfriend?

52:46.480 --> 52:52.240
Justin McElroy, I'm Griffin McElroy.

52:52.240 --> 52:53.520
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

52:53.520 --> 52:54.160
Kiss your dad.

52:54.160 --> 53:16.400
School wear on the lips.
