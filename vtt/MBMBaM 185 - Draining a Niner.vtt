00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.800
Welcome to this very special episode of My Brother, My Brother, and Me. It's our Grammy

00:48.800 --> 00:56.240
Awards 2014 special, My Name is Justin McElroy. My name is Travis McElroy. My name is Griffin

00:56.240 --> 01:03.280
McElroy, and I know that sounded weird, but I'm just so excited. I know, I've got Grammy fever.

01:04.080 --> 01:12.160
Tonight we are going to be honoring some amazing achievement in the arts of butterscotch cookie

01:12.160 --> 01:19.600
making, of ribbon candy placement, cheek kisses, cheek kisses, hair tousles, biggest purses,

01:19.600 --> 01:26.960
oversized sweaters bought, most uncomfortable fabrics, weirdest smelling quilts, weirdest

01:26.960 --> 01:30.480
smelling hair. Weirdest smelling house. Yeah, just a lot of weird, there's seven subcategories.

01:30.480 --> 01:36.080
A lot of weird smells, stainless bread. Okay, well that seems a little hateful.

01:36.080 --> 01:42.720
Most, you know, the problem with the weird smell categories is most of them are handled off camera.

01:42.720 --> 01:47.520
We don't even get to see those. They have like a special subceremony that like-

01:47.520 --> 01:51.680
These awards are presented by Tom Wopat at a separate event.

01:51.680 --> 01:55.520
It's always Tom Wopat, too. That's his hell. That's his, he did something,

01:55.520 --> 01:59.200
and that's his punishment. He did something really bad. Guys, what

01:59.200 --> 02:03.520
Grammys are you most excited about tonight? Where do you think the hot contingent's gonna be?

02:04.560 --> 02:10.240
I think it's gonna be most spangly dressed. Spanglishly dressed? Is that-

02:10.240 --> 02:18.240
Well, who's dressing with the most spangles? Who's got the most, you know, what am I looking

02:18.240 --> 02:25.360
for here? Sequins. Travis is making a play for the most confused category. Sorry, Travis,

02:25.360 --> 02:32.000
but that award has actually already been handed out by Mr. Wopat. Congratulations to Darlene Mecklen,

02:32.800 --> 02:38.800
age 73. You really went for it this year. You have no idea why you get to hang out with Tom

02:38.800 --> 02:43.280
Wopat every year. I think my favorite thing about the Grammys is, unlike other award shows,

02:43.280 --> 02:48.080
it airs at like 3.30 in the afternoon. Yeah, that's really nice because you can

02:48.080 --> 02:54.400
finish the whole award show and still have an early dinner. And boy, you thought Jacqueline

02:54.400 --> 02:58.240
Bessette took a long time to get to the stage during the Golden Globes. You haven't- You ain't

02:58.240 --> 03:06.320
seen nothing yet. Every procession to the stage lasts at least 20 to 25 minutes.

03:06.320 --> 03:10.640
And it's like a race to who can get up there before they start playing the

03:10.640 --> 03:14.960
get off the fucking stage meemaw music. It's never happened, but I hope to someday

03:14.960 --> 03:19.360
hear a meemaw deliver a speech. Someone's going to get up, someone's going to train for that,

03:19.360 --> 03:23.200
and she's going to get up there like right as the music starts and be like, nope, nope, booyah,

03:23.200 --> 03:29.200
and then walk away. I'm really looking forward to the performance. I heard that this year

03:30.160 --> 03:35.120
there's going to be a meemaw reading some Dr. Seuss. I'm really excited about it.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.080
That's going to be really nice. Why is she doing that?

03:38.080 --> 03:43.360
She's doing the first half of the places you'll go to her six-year-old grandson.

03:43.360 --> 03:46.480
I like that. That's not funny. It's just nice.

03:46.480 --> 03:52.800
Yeah. The weird thing is it won't be mic'd, so you won't be able to hear it.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.480
Okay. Let's shoot for just nice this episode. Okay.

03:56.480 --> 04:00.400
You know what the bummer about the Grammys is actually, though?

04:00.400 --> 04:06.080
Still, Meryl Streep always wins. She doesn't even have grandkids.

04:08.880 --> 04:14.800
Also, the In Memoriam reel lasts three hours. Yeah, it's three hours long.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.960
Okay, this is a comedy advice show.

04:16.960 --> 04:20.080
And they have to add some people in from the beginning of the awards show,

04:21.280 --> 04:23.920
people that were on the red carpet and are now in the video.

04:23.920 --> 04:30.080
That year that H1N1 was really bad, it actually wouldn't stop. They had to just cancel the show.

04:31.120 --> 04:34.800
They just kind of leave it on in the background as they present all the awards.

04:34.800 --> 04:39.280
Man, H1N1 took a lot of grandmas from it. So anyway, let's start with the show.

04:40.240 --> 04:45.760
Let's get on with the comedy jokes. Man, that flu just fucking devastated our old people.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.280
Speaking of Grammy fever.

04:47.280 --> 04:53.280
Man, they all drowned to death on their own mucus. Anyway, let's go ahead and get it rolling.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.280
Big wheel, keep on turning.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.280
Jokes and jokes and jokes.

04:57.280 --> 05:03.280
That swine flu canceled a lot of Disneyland trips. Let's get this ball rolling.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.280
Pack up the car, kids. We're going to Comedy Town.

05:07.280 --> 05:11.280
Grandma's not coming because she did a swine flu. Fuck, man. Wow.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.280
Yeah, a lot of them.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.280
We could have talked about Bieber.

05:15.280 --> 05:19.280
I tried to tell you we should have talked about Bieber.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.280
No, no, no. Let's talk about this devastating flu.

05:23.280 --> 05:29.280
Raise your hand if your grandma died in 2009. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Everyone, I guess.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.280
Oh, I'm sorry grandmothers.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.280
I've got a coworker who's a complete idiot.

05:37.280 --> 05:43.280
Nice guy, but total moron who's completely unable to perform even the smallest task on her own.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.280
I'm sorry.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.280
What's wrong?

05:47.280 --> 05:49.280
You still laughing about that swine flu?

05:49.280 --> 05:51.280
I'm still thinking about dead grannies.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.280
There's nothing funny about it.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.280
He says laughing.

05:59.280 --> 06:05.280
So the coworker's an asshole and once in a while he'll do something stupid.

06:05.280 --> 06:09.280
Everybody will fix it for him and say something like, I hope I didn't just look too stupid.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.280
And our question asker tries to make him feel better about himself, but he's getting tired of it.

06:13.280 --> 06:21.280
And he's trying to find a balance between supportive and making him feel dumb.

06:21.280 --> 06:25.280
Doesn't want to be a jerk, but it's something even his 11-year-old could figure out.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.280
That's from overly supportive in Ohio.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.280
I paraphrase there because it's a long question, but you get the gist.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.280
Well, he's playing you.

06:33.280 --> 06:39.280
Oh, this is one of those you mow the lawn shitty one time your dad won't ask you to do it anymore type situations.

06:39.280 --> 06:43.280
And even better because then he finishes it by going, I hope I didn't look stupid.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.280
No!

06:45.280 --> 06:47.280
No, you did great.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.280
You're my big office worker boy.

06:49.280 --> 06:53.280
You mowed your basketball number into our front yard.

06:53.280 --> 06:59.280
So in terms of completion, not great, but you expressed yourself and that really matters.

06:59.280 --> 07:03.280
So you think he's on the grift?

07:03.280 --> 07:11.280
I think everyone's on the grift, but I think this person is on the grift spectrum, like leaning super hard into it.

07:11.280 --> 07:23.280
So is the response not to try to correct this person, but somehow make yourself appear less capable than this person is?

07:23.280 --> 07:36.280
So could you go stride into the boss's office, deliver the big report and then once you set it on his desk, you just dump a bucket of soapy water on it and go like, did I do that?

07:36.280 --> 07:39.280
I wanted to clean it.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.280
I cleaned up your hard drive, boss.

07:41.280 --> 07:44.280
And then you pour soapy water on his hard drive.

07:44.280 --> 07:49.280
Is it possible that your coworker is an 11 year old who has been big into an adult body?

07:49.280 --> 07:53.280
Oh, that is always, always your first inclination.

07:53.280 --> 07:54.280
And you know what?

07:54.280 --> 07:56.280
It's a good one because you're right most of the time.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.280
You're right most of the time.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.280
So here's what you need to do.

07:58.280 --> 08:04.280
You just quarter him and you say like, Joshua, I know what's happened and we can fix this together.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.280
I know where there's this ultamachine.

08:06.280 --> 08:12.280
We'll get to it and we'll do this and let's do a secret handshake to prove that I know you're a kid.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.280
Yeah.

08:13.280 --> 08:17.280
Here, take this adult go-gurt and then you hand him an adult go-gurt.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.280
I think it's just Activia.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.280
I think it's just Activia, Griffin.

08:22.280 --> 08:28.280
I wish they would make like, I love food in tubes, but I don't want all that colorful packaging.

08:28.280 --> 08:32.280
I wish they had something a little more upscale, a little classier, maybe leather.

08:32.280 --> 08:37.280
You know, I drink those yogurt smoothies because they have all the probiotics that my gurgle guts need,

08:37.280 --> 08:39.280
but I don't get to squeeze it.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.280
I don't get to like force it into my...

08:41.280 --> 08:53.280
I don't get to like recreate the peristalsis of an intestine as I just like sploosh the food glop into my mouth hole.

08:53.280 --> 08:56.280
What if this guy has JAK disease?

08:56.280 --> 09:02.280
Oh, what if he has combination JAK disease and bigitis?

09:02.280 --> 09:04.280
No, no, it's fine.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.280
It's fine.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.280
I'm going to look like this in a couple years anyway.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.280
No, it's okay.

09:07.280 --> 09:13.280
So every one year I do eight, but then I also had to skip like nine through 36.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.280
So like kind of a raw deal I'm getting here.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.280
I'm basically two.

09:18.280 --> 09:20.280
I'm basically two years old is what I'm...

09:20.280 --> 09:21.280
I was born...

09:21.280 --> 09:22.280
I wasn't born yesterday.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.280
I was born last Thursday.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.280
I do have JAK and big.

09:26.280 --> 09:30.280
Yeah, I still have like a little bit of umbilical stumble down there.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.280
But it's okay because I also have Benny Button.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.280
So hold on, let me figure this out.

09:35.280 --> 09:39.280
I was born at two, skip to 10, skip to 36.

09:39.280 --> 09:44.280
I will be 45 next week and then 28 the week after that.

09:44.280 --> 09:47.280
Yeah, I think I figured that out.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.280
Basically the Highlander is so...

09:49.280 --> 09:54.280
Look for that question on the SATs someday soon.

09:54.280 --> 10:04.280
I mean, if someone is going to be a screw up and you're not their superior,

10:04.280 --> 10:06.280
I think you just kind of have to lump it.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.280
I mean...

10:07.280 --> 10:08.280
No, Justin, you are wrong.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.280
And I'll tell you why.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.280
Everybody's covering.

10:10.280 --> 10:14.280
Well, at least I got to state my whole point.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.280
I can tell you really weighing all the pluses and minuses.

10:17.280 --> 10:22.280
Justin, you sounded like you were about to be wrong.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.280
The problem is everybody's covering for the guy.

10:24.280 --> 10:25.280
I didn't have a point either.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.280
Yeah, I mean, yes, but...

10:27.280 --> 10:32.280
I understand that it's like you want to do it because you're not a terrible human being.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.280
You don't want to see this person fail.

10:33.280 --> 10:40.280
But at the same time, every time that you fix it for him without attention being brought to it,

10:40.280 --> 10:45.280
you're not helping the dude because it sounds like he's not capable of doing this job.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.280
Yeah, but you are helping the dude.

10:47.280 --> 10:51.280
By definition of helping the dude, you're covering his tracks constantly.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.280
That's what help is.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.280
Making it so he never gets busted.

10:54.280 --> 10:57.280
But what if he progresses rapidly and people are like, you know,

10:57.280 --> 11:00.280
his boss who doesn't know any of this just sees the work he does.

11:00.280 --> 11:03.280
And he's like, oh, okay, everything's turning out well.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.280
Promotion.

11:04.280 --> 11:09.280
And then he runs that business into the ground and 100,000 people are laid off.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.280
I think the best solution...

11:11.280 --> 11:12.280
This is a big business.

11:12.280 --> 11:16.280
What kind of overhead does this 100,000 employee business have?

11:16.280 --> 11:18.280
They make adult go-gurt.

11:18.280 --> 11:22.280
They're an Illuminati.

11:22.280 --> 11:27.280
Everybody has to help him run all of the conspiracies.

11:27.280 --> 11:33.280
Maybe the solution is somewhere in the middle of telling him what's wrong about it,

11:33.280 --> 11:38.280
but making him make the corrections because that's probably the best way of helping him to learn.

11:38.280 --> 11:46.280
And also, you're not going to have to do the work for him because I feel like after you explain to him

11:46.280 --> 11:52.280
what the mistake is and have him corrected himself, then he has to sort of be responsible for his own product.

11:52.280 --> 11:59.280
But I also would say, do you really want to be the George to this dude's Lenny for the rest of the time that he works there?

11:59.280 --> 12:04.280
If it does culminate in an assassination, then...

12:04.280 --> 12:06.280
This is probably not something you want to be a part of.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.280
Yeah, definitely not.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.280
You guys want a Yahoo?

12:09.280 --> 12:10.280
Please.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.280
This Yahoo was sent in by Alan Black.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.280
Thanks, Alan.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.280
It's by Yahoo!

12:13.280 --> 12:15.280
And it's just user Taylor B. who asks,

12:15.280 --> 12:19.280
has anybody been to the Guy Fieri show?

12:19.280 --> 12:22.280
If you have, is it appropriate for younger children?

12:22.280 --> 12:23.280
No.

12:23.280 --> 12:28.280
My daughter is a huge fan of him, and we got some free tickets,

12:28.280 --> 12:31.280
but I'm not sure if it's appropriate for her or not.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.280
Help, please.

12:33.280 --> 12:39.280
You know, when you hear stuff like that, it always makes me remember that there are parents and authority figures in the world

12:39.280 --> 12:44.280
that their kid said once when Guy Fieri was on TV and their mother was like,

12:44.280 --> 12:45.280
don't you like this guy?

12:45.280 --> 12:47.280
And he's like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, he's great, whatever.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.280
And then went back to like reading their book,

12:49.280 --> 12:53.280
and their mother just clicks in their head, huge Guy Fieri fan.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.280
This lady loves Guy Fieri.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.280
Got it.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.280
I'll remember that for next Christmas.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.280
Is the show...

12:59.280 --> 13:01.280
Get some of those Guy Fieri tickets.

13:01.280 --> 13:07.280
Is the Guy Fieri Road show appropriate for younger audiences?

13:07.280 --> 13:09.280
Is it TV PG?

13:09.280 --> 13:12.280
If you leave at intermission, you're fine.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.280
Because after intermission...

13:13.280 --> 13:16.280
At two is where it starts to get a little not safe for work.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.280
Before it starts, he's like, all right, is all the kids gone?

13:18.280 --> 13:20.280
All right, fuck nuts.

13:20.280 --> 13:23.280
Let's cook some food that's going to make you cry.

13:23.280 --> 13:27.280
Before I make these spare ribs, let me get my balls out.

13:27.280 --> 13:33.280
And yes, they are bleached blonde and spiky.

13:33.280 --> 13:42.280
This is a great time to remind parents that you have got to be cautious about exposing your children to Guy Fieri.

13:42.280 --> 13:50.280
As they're too young, they can't process it, they think they're having fun, and they could get addicted.

13:50.280 --> 13:58.280
You think this is a good thing for your kid to be into when he or she is a little kid,

13:58.280 --> 14:06.280
but then when he's 14, his first day of high school, and he's wearing a visor, that one's on you.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.280
That visor's on you.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.280
I mean, it's on your kid, but morally it's on you.

14:11.280 --> 14:18.280
I went looking for some more information about Guy Fieri's roadshow, trying to get a concrete answer to the question,

14:18.280 --> 14:21.280
and I stumbled on Guy Fieri's Twitter account.

14:21.280 --> 14:26.280
Would anyone be interested in what he's been cooking up there on his Twitter feed?

14:26.280 --> 14:30.280
Is it covered in cracklins and bacon butter?

14:30.280 --> 14:34.280
Cooking it up big time for new season of Guy's Big Bite.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.280
You're going to dig it.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.280
Okay, that's pretty benign.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.280
I feel like I ate that sentence.

14:39.280 --> 14:43.280
Wait, Justin, could you say that again, but like he's sad about it?

14:43.280 --> 14:49.280
Cooking it up big time for a new season of Guy's Big Bite.

14:49.280 --> 14:52.280
You're going to dig it.

14:52.280 --> 14:59.280
Just hit Bentonville, Arkansas for a big Walmart meeting about Guy Fieri's sausages.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.280
God, I swear to-

15:00.280 --> 15:02.280
Say it at a killer hotel.

15:02.280 --> 15:07.280
I swear to God, when you're doing it, maybe it's the impression or maybe it's the words that you're saying,

15:07.280 --> 15:11.280
he has said big several times in both these treats.

15:11.280 --> 15:15.280
Just like all I'm hearing is just consonants, is all I'm hearing from you.

15:15.280 --> 15:20.280
Pick a pickle, pick a pickle, pick a pickle, pick a pickle.

15:20.280 --> 15:28.280
Don't get a pickle, pick a pickle, pick a pickle, pick a pickle, pick a pickle.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.280
Yeah, it's funny.

15:29.280 --> 15:34.280
There's a thing that happens in the human brain where you can leave out every fourth letter,

15:34.280 --> 15:36.280
and people will still read it the same way.

15:36.280 --> 15:41.280
I think maybe that's just how Guy Fieri communicates with the world as a whole,

15:41.280 --> 15:47.280
and we just as a people have been filling in the blanks, and it's a cry for help.

15:47.280 --> 15:51.280
Some friends of mine found my salsas in Roatan, Honduras.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.280
Dig it.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.280
Is that a tweet?

15:55.280 --> 16:01.280
Does he have a secret stash of salsas in Roatan?

16:01.280 --> 16:06.280
I think they're salsas that belong to him, I think they're salsas that he made.

16:06.280 --> 16:10.280
They found my salsas and I had to kill them.

16:10.280 --> 16:14.280
My secret salsa stockpile.

16:14.280 --> 16:18.280
Apparently, so Yahoo Answers user Alana answers,

16:18.280 --> 16:23.280
it's supposed to be family friendly, but there are reports of body jokes in innuendos.

16:23.280 --> 16:26.280
More from the flair bartender than from Guy Fieri.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.280
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, this just in.

16:28.280 --> 16:32.280
Reports of body jokes in innuendos coming from the Guy Fieri Roadshow.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.280
Strike team, assemble.

16:34.280 --> 16:38.280
It's supposed to be family friendly, but there's a little bit of body.

16:38.280 --> 16:39.280
Film at 11.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.280
Freedom ain't free.

16:40.280 --> 16:45.280
To all veterans, past, present, and future, thanks for your service.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.280
What?

16:46.280 --> 16:47.280
It wasn't really about food as much.

16:47.280 --> 16:50.280
I thought he said something about Fritos in the beginning.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.280
Fritos ain't free.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.280
Come buy me some.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.280
I'm so sad.

16:56.280 --> 16:59.280
Stoked to see my new line of sausages at Walmart.

16:59.280 --> 17:04.280
Check out the four killer flavors.

17:04.280 --> 17:07.280
And then there's a picture of him with ZZ Top and the guys from Duck Dynasty.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.280
Perfect.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.280
Perfection.

17:10.280 --> 17:15.280
I'm noticing lately I'm incredibly sensitive and insulted slash hurt easily.

17:15.280 --> 17:24.280
For one instance, I have a friend who greets me by saying, fuck you.

17:24.280 --> 17:27.280
And while I know he's joking, it still makes me feel better.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.280
Pretty good joke.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.280
Hey, great joke.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.280
Pretty good joke.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.280
Solid goof.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.280
Yuck, yuck, yuck.

17:32.280 --> 17:35.280
It worked on us, but we thought that Grammy thing was funny.

17:35.280 --> 17:39.280
Also, if I go to Jack in the Box and the girls at the window don't greet me with a smile,

17:39.280 --> 17:41.280
I feel personally responsible.

17:41.280 --> 17:43.280
How do I grow thicker skin?

17:43.280 --> 17:44.280
And that's from Gabriel.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.280
The first one is like, okay.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.280
Gabriel, you're here just in time.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.280
Nobody owes you a smile.

17:51.280 --> 17:55.280
You need to get over the idea that people owe you smiles.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.280
Awesome.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.280
No one at Jack in the Box is ever happy to see someone roll.

17:58.280 --> 18:01.280
If anything, they're disappointed in you.

18:01.280 --> 18:07.280
They have to paint that smile on the Jack in the Box mascot every day because just the

18:07.280 --> 18:10.280
fumes from the fryer just like peel it off.

18:10.280 --> 18:12.280
That is how sad that restaurant wants you to be.

18:12.280 --> 18:19.280
Oh, Gabriel, you have got to start loving yourself a little more.

18:19.280 --> 18:25.280
You have got to start having a little more time, a little more consideration, a little

18:25.280 --> 18:31.280
more energy put into Project Gabriel, which sounds sweet now that I say it.

18:31.280 --> 18:35.280
I mean, it sounds like you're saying you need to have more frequent jerk sessions.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.280
I don't mean, I don't mean frequent jerks.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.280
Find the time for Gabriel time.

18:39.280 --> 18:44.280
Make the time every day at noon 15.

18:44.280 --> 18:52.280
I don't see how the first time your friend says fuck you, if it bothers you, you tell

18:52.280 --> 18:53.280
him.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.280
If it doesn't bother you so much and you want to say friends with him, you tell him fuck

18:56.280 --> 18:57.280
you back.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.280
Or just sort of hurt him.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.280
Just let that one ride.

19:02.280 --> 19:09.280
And that seems like a situation that will sort of sort itself out because you do you

19:09.280 --> 19:12.280
get pulled over by a cop like, oh, fuck you, officer.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.280
What do you need?

19:13.280 --> 19:14.280
License and registration?

19:14.280 --> 19:15.280
All right.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.280
Let me get that for you.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.280
Fuck you real quick.

19:17.280 --> 19:18.280
All right.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.280
Here you go.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.280
I really you can't.

19:21.280 --> 19:26.280
Gabriel, right now you have what was called an external locus of control.

19:26.280 --> 19:30.280
You're handing over everything about your demeanor and your mindset.

19:30.280 --> 19:32.280
You're putting it in the hands of other people.

19:32.280 --> 19:36.280
And I guarantee you when you do that, it is always it is never going to pan out because

19:36.280 --> 19:40.280
the world's never going to care as much about your own feelings as you do.

19:40.280 --> 19:45.280
You have got to first off, take time and build your self-confidence a little bit.

19:45.280 --> 19:49.280
Think about all the things that are great about you, because I know there are many places

19:49.280 --> 19:50.280
you excel.

19:50.280 --> 19:55.280
And then once you once you've done that, start focusing on how you can make other people's

19:55.280 --> 19:59.280
days brighter rather than how those people are making you feel.

19:59.280 --> 20:03.280
Because I guarantee you once you start putting energy into that, it is going to come back

20:03.280 --> 20:05.280
on you several fold.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.280
That's it.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.280
That's the only way to go through it.

20:07.280 --> 20:13.280
Because you're just you're like a beautiful plastic bag floating through the air whimsically

20:13.280 --> 20:22.280
just hoping no one, you know, films you, films you, sells it, sells it to Sam Mendes to use

20:22.280 --> 20:23.280
it as movie.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.280
You don't want that.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.280
No.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.280
Let me throw this out.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.280
Maybe you snap.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.280
Okay.

20:28.280 --> 20:29.280
And your friends like, fuck you.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.280
Like, no, fuck you.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.280
Smack him in the face.

20:31.280 --> 20:34.280
And when the girls the dragon box don't smile at you, you walk inside and go, why didn't

20:34.280 --> 20:35.280
you smile at me?

20:35.280 --> 20:36.280
Why didn't you smile at me?

20:36.280 --> 20:39.280
Are you not happy to give me burgers and tacos?

20:39.280 --> 20:45.200
Listen, you work at a restaurant where I could get burgers and tacos in the same box.

20:45.200 --> 20:50.840
Like how does the farce of that should make you so happy?

20:50.840 --> 20:53.800
I'm just saying, turn it into like a Nicholas Cage movie.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.520
Have you not seen your own commercials?

20:55.520 --> 20:57.920
They're hilarious.

20:57.920 --> 21:02.000
I don't get, I don't get to see those cause we don't have any Jack in the Boxes here.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.560
If you want, I can like DVR them.

21:03.560 --> 21:04.560
Can you DVR them?

21:04.560 --> 21:07.000
I can just describe them to you on the show.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.320
Can you just tape them, Trav, and then like get a whole tape together of them and then

21:10.320 --> 21:11.320
just mail them the tape?

21:11.320 --> 21:12.320
Yeah.

21:12.320 --> 21:17.200
Jack in the Box sells a dinner box cause everything does come in boxes there, true to name.

21:17.200 --> 21:24.080
That is like, I think it's even called like the 4am box and it is for mega chiefers.

21:24.080 --> 21:32.160
It is for people that have been sucking down the saltiest spliffs and they do not hide

21:32.160 --> 21:33.160
it.

21:33.160 --> 21:38.480
It is for, it's basically like two dudes sitting on a couch just like taking a bong hit and

21:38.480 --> 21:44.600
then like blowing the smoke into their 4am box and then just like drinking down a taco.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.360
No, I have not seen these ads.

21:47.360 --> 21:50.280
I'm assuming you're exaggerating a little bit, but.

21:50.280 --> 21:54.080
They definitely do the bong rips.

21:54.080 --> 21:59.680
And at one point the dude takes off the giant white ball Jack in the Box helmet thing and

21:59.680 --> 22:03.720
just smoke pours out of the bottom and just pours out of it.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.320
It's been Snoop the whole time.

22:05.320 --> 22:06.320
Yeah.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.560
He is not as into marijuana as he once was.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.480
It's part of his reform, part of his reformation.

22:11.480 --> 22:12.480
I didn't know this.

22:12.480 --> 22:13.480
Thank you for the update.

22:13.480 --> 22:14.480
Yeah.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.520
Gabriel, you're great.

22:15.520 --> 22:16.960
You have great taste in podcasts.

22:16.960 --> 22:17.980
I know that.

22:17.980 --> 22:19.180
You have a cool name.

22:19.180 --> 22:20.180
There's that.

22:20.180 --> 22:21.760
There's lots of other good stuff about you.

22:21.760 --> 22:26.480
Focus on that stuff and don't worry so much about how other people are making you feel

22:26.480 --> 22:28.440
and stop with the Jack in the Box thing.

22:28.440 --> 22:29.440
That's just nutty.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.440
Yeah.

22:30.440 --> 22:33.880
Those people have to work at Jack in the Box and every time you see them they know they're

22:33.880 --> 22:35.680
about to hurt you with food.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.960
Like that's a double thing that they have to overcome.

22:37.960 --> 22:38.960
You have to be a little more generous.

22:38.960 --> 22:39.960
You have to be a little more generous.

22:39.960 --> 22:40.960
They should be awash with their regret.

22:40.960 --> 22:41.960
Yeah.

22:41.960 --> 22:42.960
I'm so sorry about this.

22:42.960 --> 22:43.960
I'm sorry about this.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.880
If it were up to me, I wouldn't hand this to you.

22:45.880 --> 22:46.880
I care about you.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.740
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

22:48.740 --> 22:51.120
This Yahoo was sent in by Amanda Thatcher.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.120
Thanks, Amanda.

22:52.120 --> 22:56.800
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Jessie, who asks.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.560
How to make your own hot dog.

22:59.560 --> 23:01.280
How do I make my own hot dog?

23:01.280 --> 23:06.080
I would like to make a beef hot dog that is nine feet long and try to eat it in one sitting.

23:06.080 --> 23:09.320
Also I need instructions on how to make a nine foot long bun also.

23:09.320 --> 23:12.240
Any suggestion, fellow hot dog lovers?

23:12.240 --> 23:15.120
All right.

23:15.120 --> 23:18.140
You can like human centipede it.

23:18.140 --> 23:20.920
You're going to have to take a mulligan on the bun.

23:20.920 --> 23:23.200
You are not going to be able to make a nine feet bun.

23:23.200 --> 23:28.320
You're going to have to make a long, long, long hot dog and then put several buns on

23:28.320 --> 23:29.320
it.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.320
There's no way around.

23:30.320 --> 23:31.320
Or get a bun.

23:31.320 --> 23:38.260
Bun step one, go to Subway and buy nine foot long, just the bread.

23:38.260 --> 23:40.000
That would be so fucking gross, Travis.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Think about what you're saying.

23:41.000 --> 23:46.280
Think about how big and robust those delicious Subway rolls are and then imagine like a tiny

23:46.280 --> 23:47.280
little wiener.

23:47.280 --> 23:51.640
Well, I really just want to see the look on the people at Subway's face and you go, I

23:51.640 --> 23:54.120
would like nine of the Italian herb, please.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.120
Okay.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.120
What kind of sandwich?

23:56.120 --> 23:57.120
No.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.120
No.

23:58.120 --> 23:59.120
You don't understand me.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.120
I just, and I do need them cut down the middle, please.

24:00.120 --> 24:01.780
That's a pretty good idea, Travis.

24:01.780 --> 24:04.040
I wish you could buy hot dog buns at the store.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.040
Well, no.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.040
No.

24:06.040 --> 24:11.580
Guys, I wish there was a place where you could get bread except for Subway.

24:11.580 --> 24:16.240
Why did we ever give them the monopoly on bread sales?

24:16.240 --> 24:20.280
Rachel made some banana bread yesterday and a lawyer came to our house, issued a cease

24:20.280 --> 24:22.240
and desist right there on the spot.

24:22.240 --> 24:23.240
Took the bread away.

24:23.240 --> 24:26.120
Travis, Travis, you do some gross cooking.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.320
Have you ever tried to make your own hot dog?

24:29.320 --> 24:34.240
Would you ever consider making your own hot dog?

24:34.240 --> 24:37.520
I know that there are people in this world that like make their own sausage.

24:37.520 --> 24:41.120
Yeah, but I know you don't want to see that.

24:41.120 --> 24:43.000
Sausage comes from somewhere.

24:43.000 --> 24:49.200
There is a reason we use the phrase, this is how the sausage gets made.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.560
There's a reason why, because it's gross as balls.

24:51.560 --> 24:55.100
You don't want to make your own hot dog because you have to see it.

24:55.100 --> 25:01.040
The only way to make it, and listen, if you think it doesn't bother you, okay, so eating

25:01.040 --> 25:08.720
hot dogs, what it really is is a test of your own mental acuity and your ability to distract

25:08.720 --> 25:11.200
yourself from facts.

25:11.200 --> 25:17.880
As you snap into a hot dog and you taste that juicy, beefy flavor, you are swept away by

25:17.880 --> 25:23.520
the taste, and then you think, okay, I have five inches or so left of this hot dog, and

25:23.520 --> 25:28.440
I'm in a race to keep from remembering how hot dogs are made and the things that are

25:28.440 --> 25:30.560
in them and the things I would never know are in them.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.120
It's like 75% toenails, right?

25:32.120 --> 25:33.120
Yeah.

25:33.120 --> 25:37.120
Yeah, at least when you're doing like a bratwurst, like Italian sausage, it's like, okay, I know

25:37.120 --> 25:38.120
that that's me.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.120
I know what that is.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.680
I guess, Travis, you're not a part of this conversation.

25:40.680 --> 25:45.520
This is a conversation for fellow hot dog lovers only, so if you're going to want to

25:45.520 --> 25:50.480
try and like go outside the box, then maybe you should excuse yourself.

25:50.480 --> 25:54.160
It's weird that I have to realize that a hot dog is the kind of food that the bigger it

25:54.160 --> 25:57.440
is, the more, like it's exponentially more disgusting.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.520
That's what I'm saying.

25:58.520 --> 26:05.860
I'm saying nine feet in by like by three feet, the reality of hot dogs is going to be soaking

26:05.860 --> 26:08.120
into you from every angle.

26:08.120 --> 26:12.320
Like your stomach will be so full of hot dog and all you'll be able to think about is like

26:12.320 --> 26:18.800
that giant crazy grinder that they just throw whatever meat related products they can find

26:18.800 --> 26:19.800
into it.

26:19.800 --> 26:20.800
Meat adjacent.

26:20.800 --> 26:21.800
Just meat adjacent.

26:21.800 --> 26:26.800
Hey, uh, dog, do rocks have protein?

26:26.800 --> 26:27.800
I don't know.

26:27.800 --> 26:28.800
I don't know.

26:28.800 --> 26:29.800
Just throw it in.

26:29.800 --> 26:30.800
We made it to eight and a half feet and we're out.

26:30.800 --> 26:31.800
What do we got?

26:31.800 --> 26:32.800
Hey, a pig.

26:32.800 --> 26:33.800
Hey, a pig looked at this chair.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.680
Yeah, throw that chair right in the grinder.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.400
Hand me that stack of invoices.

26:38.400 --> 26:43.960
I did not know you guys were so cavalier about hating hot dogs.

26:43.960 --> 26:44.960
I don't.

26:44.960 --> 26:50.000
What I'm saying, Griffin, is that some things you have to just eat them and not think about

26:50.000 --> 26:51.160
it too much.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.160
It's about distraction.

26:52.160 --> 26:58.600
And I'm saying you're going to lose the distraction game if you are eating nine feet of hot dogs.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.640
Unless, unless you're fucking Kobayashi.

27:01.640 --> 27:02.640
Okay.

27:02.640 --> 27:11.440
I bet that dude could drain a niner in, I would say, probably 80 seconds.

27:11.440 --> 27:14.040
It's like you walk by in your kitchen and you're like, where's that nine foot hot dog

27:14.040 --> 27:15.040
I made for myself?

27:15.040 --> 27:16.040
I literally just made it.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.040
It took me a week.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.040
And you look over and Kobayashi's just like burping.

27:18.040 --> 27:21.720
He's like, I didn't even know what I was doing.

27:21.720 --> 27:25.160
Do you think because it's so long, there's no table that can fit it and here I have to

27:25.160 --> 27:28.280
put it on the ground and then he'd also have to lay on the ground and it would look kind

27:28.280 --> 27:29.280
of like Pac-Man?

27:29.280 --> 27:30.280
Yeah.

27:30.280 --> 27:31.280
Just like walk, walk, walk, walk.

27:31.280 --> 27:33.200
It would look like he's doing the worm.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.280
Don't you think it would be cool if there's a nine foot hot dog and one end was Scooby

27:36.280 --> 27:38.960
Doo and the other end was Shaggy and they like ate it.

27:38.960 --> 27:43.800
Oh, and you put like a dab of ketchup right in the center and it's you race to the ketchup.

27:43.800 --> 27:47.200
Then they kind of kissed and they're like, whoa, that was an accident, but then they

27:47.200 --> 27:48.200
kind of liked it.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.200
Do you want to do it again?

27:49.200 --> 27:50.200
Yeah.

27:50.200 --> 27:54.760
And then they just kind of keep kissing and then Fred's there and he's like, you guys

27:54.760 --> 27:56.760
keep going and I'll just snap some pictures.

27:56.760 --> 28:01.840
I got a Scooby snack for you and then he does touch himself.

28:01.840 --> 28:07.620
There is no way you're going to be able to transport a nine foot long hot dog and have

28:07.620 --> 28:13.680
it maintain structural integrity without several people having their hands on it.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.800
Like no question, right?

28:15.800 --> 28:21.480
You can buy 10 foot PVC pipe at Home Depot so you just need to construct some kind of

28:21.480 --> 28:24.200
tubular carrying device.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.200
You know what you need?

28:25.200 --> 28:34.400
It's a coffin, it's just a big coffin and you lay the big hot dog down in it and then

28:34.400 --> 28:35.400
you can dress it.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.200
It'll be like one of those little paper trays that they give you at the ballpark with the

28:38.200 --> 28:42.000
hot dog, but it's giant and then you can go ahead and eat it and then you just lie right

28:42.000 --> 28:45.520
down in it because then you're done.

28:45.520 --> 28:46.520
Because then you're done.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.400
That's your last accomplishment.

28:48.400 --> 28:54.080
You're inducing the end of your life, but hey, what a way to go, you know what I mean?

28:54.080 --> 28:58.360
How come Kevorkian never thought of jamming a nine foot hot dog?

28:58.360 --> 28:59.360
I watched it drift off.

28:59.360 --> 29:04.200
The head says, I can't believe I ate the whole thing and then died.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.200
It is your right.

29:05.200 --> 29:12.600
I believe to end your life however you see fit and in your case, I believe the best approach

29:12.600 --> 29:16.400
would be to slam one of these juicy ballpark frags.

29:16.400 --> 29:19.320
Just slam, not just one, a niner.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.320
A niner.

29:20.320 --> 29:21.320
Listen.

29:21.320 --> 29:22.320
I know a guy.

29:22.320 --> 29:23.720
I know a guy.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.520
He can make you a niner.

29:25.520 --> 29:32.680
All you do is drain it, do it fast enough, and the pain is over.

29:32.680 --> 29:38.640
The pain is just beginning, but your death will soon follow, so it wasn't a huge deal.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.920
You're at foot six like, Doc, I don't know if I can do it.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.840
You got to push through, baby.

29:43.840 --> 29:44.840
Sweet release on the other end.

29:44.840 --> 29:47.760
And he's saying, do it, Adam, for Man vs. Food.

29:47.760 --> 29:48.820
Do it.

29:48.820 --> 29:53.240
This week on the series finale of Man vs. Food and also Adam.

29:53.240 --> 29:56.400
Adam's finale of the series of his life.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.400
And today, food won.

29:57.400 --> 29:58.400
Let's go to the money zone.

29:58.400 --> 30:15.400
At everybody's part of Hulu.com, Hulu.com is a staple.

30:15.400 --> 30:19.860
It's probably everybody's homepage at this point, but Hulu Plus is beyond that.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.620
It's beyond Hulu.com.

30:21.620 --> 30:27.280
If there was something better, if it was Hulu 2, the sequel to Hulu.com, it would be Hulu

30:27.280 --> 30:28.280
Plus.

30:28.280 --> 30:34.000
You can watch thousands of shows all from your living room or on your smartphone or

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
your tablet.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.200
They've got movies, too.

30:36.200 --> 30:40.560
And there's tons of shows, like SNL, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Shark Tank, man, I love Shark

30:40.560 --> 30:41.560
Tank.

30:41.560 --> 30:42.560
Do you guys love Shark Tank?

30:42.560 --> 30:46.800
I know we talk about it sometimes, but I love Shark Tank.

30:46.800 --> 30:52.320
I like watching snake oil salesmen just get fucking screwed.

30:52.320 --> 30:58.280
Mark Cuban really took down that guy that was selling a diet pill.

30:58.280 --> 31:01.280
They've also got Lost, Law & Order, SVU, Doctor Who, Community.

31:01.280 --> 31:06.280
There's so many things, and there's new shows that they just made up.

31:06.280 --> 31:11.400
There's original shows that you can't watch anywhere else, like The Wrong Man's and Behind

31:11.400 --> 31:16.360
the Mask, which is a documentary series about mascots, super fascinating.

31:16.360 --> 31:21.240
It's $8 a month, but you know you're not gonna pay that here.

31:21.240 --> 31:24.280
This is my brother, my brother, and me.

31:24.280 --> 31:28.160
For those first two weeks, you're not gonna pay eight bucks, you're not gonna pay seven,

31:28.160 --> 31:31.040
and you're not even gonna pay six, like you may all be thinking.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.640
But they're also not gonna pay you money.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.280
It just balances out in the middle.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.280
Okay, listen.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.680
We're gonna be straight up with you.

31:36.680 --> 31:40.160
There's a lot of numbers you're not gonna pay.

31:40.160 --> 31:43.520
There's so many numbers, and you're not gonna pay any of them.

31:43.520 --> 31:44.520
750?

31:44.520 --> 31:45.520
No.

31:45.520 --> 31:46.520
Stop wasting our time?

31:46.520 --> 31:47.520
No.

31:47.520 --> 31:48.520
Stop wasting our time.

31:48.520 --> 31:53.920
Guys, what I'm prepared to offer you, I'm a representative of Hulu.com, I'm prepared

31:53.920 --> 31:59.560
to offer you, if it's acceptable for those first two weeks, the price of $2 for the first

31:59.560 --> 32:00.560
two weeks.

32:00.560 --> 32:01.560
What do you think?

32:01.560 --> 32:02.560
Huh, audience?

32:02.560 --> 32:03.560
How's that sound?

32:03.560 --> 32:04.560
$2 a week?

32:04.560 --> 32:05.560
No!

32:05.560 --> 32:06.560
Lower!

32:06.560 --> 32:07.560
Not good enough.

32:07.560 --> 32:08.560
Okay.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.560
Gosh, I don't know.

32:09.560 --> 32:10.560
I'm gonna get in trouble with this guy back at the home office.

32:10.560 --> 32:11.560
Can you just say the price of a thing?

32:11.560 --> 32:14.520
We've just been doing this for so, it's free, it's free, it's free.

32:14.520 --> 32:19.960
Can we also get some, like, rope, and maybe some kind of, like, knife and sharpening device?

32:19.960 --> 32:21.760
Uh, yes.

32:21.760 --> 32:27.240
I'll give you a knife sharpener and the car wax and HuluPlus.com for the first two weeks

32:27.240 --> 32:28.240
for free.

32:28.240 --> 32:31.360
Just go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother and get that free trial.

32:31.360 --> 32:34.760
I guess a little editor's note, they won't give you rope and car wax.

32:34.760 --> 32:35.760
Probably not.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.240
Well, I mean, ask.

32:37.240 --> 32:42.520
Travis, were you trying to think of, like, one of the add-on gadgets that they'd give

32:42.520 --> 32:45.920
away on Amazing Discoveries and you came up with rope?

32:45.920 --> 32:47.960
There was always rope.

32:47.960 --> 32:50.840
It was always, like, I'm gonna throw in this, like, clothesline.

32:50.840 --> 32:54.520
I shit you not, I'm not, it was, like, everywhere.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.000
And we'll throw in this rope.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
More!

32:57.000 --> 32:58.440
Well, obviously more.

32:58.440 --> 33:02.120
Going on way too long and that HuluPlus ad sure made me hungry.

33:02.120 --> 33:03.120
Mm-hmm.

33:03.120 --> 33:06.120
Does anybody have any solutions for that?

33:06.120 --> 33:07.560
You gonna eat something?

33:07.560 --> 33:09.480
Can I recommend a nine-foot hot dog?

33:09.480 --> 33:14.200
Okay, I don't, I don't need all those, all that stuff in there.

33:14.200 --> 33:24.520
All the, like, CBC and DMT and PVP, DMX, JTT.

33:24.520 --> 33:27.600
I don't need to eat a hot dog made of Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

33:27.600 --> 33:32.480
Thank you for offering, Jonathan, a hot dog made from your body.

33:32.480 --> 33:35.960
You are the giving tree of humans, but I am not interested.

33:35.960 --> 33:40.080
What I am interested in is that nature box.

33:40.080 --> 33:44.200
Listen, Jesse, you said you're gonna lose weight this new year.

33:44.200 --> 33:47.040
Let me tell you straight up, you've been doing a pretty shitty job of it so far.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.040
Okay.

33:48.040 --> 33:54.120
I don't care if you have actually lost weight, you can do it better by eating healthier food.

33:54.120 --> 33:58.600
So instead of going to that vending machine, pressing that J5 to get, like, a pack of Starbursts

33:58.600 --> 34:03.820
and that's lunch, no, you can snack smarter with a nature box.

34:03.820 --> 34:09.040
It's a box that gets delivered to you, filled with great tasting and healthy snacks sent

34:09.040 --> 34:10.040
right to your door.

34:10.040 --> 34:14.440
So when you say healthy snacks, you mean like that, like a celery wrapped in carrots?

34:14.440 --> 34:20.160
No, yes, that's exactly what, it's a celery wearing a carrot bow tie.

34:20.160 --> 34:22.600
No, how about French toast granola?

34:22.600 --> 34:23.600
Yum.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.640
How about a salted caramel pretzel pop?

34:25.640 --> 34:29.480
Every word that I just said in that, in those four words, salted, yes.

34:29.480 --> 34:34.480
Salted caramel, pretzel, sure, pops, my favorite food delivery form.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.280
Dark cocoa almonds, whatever.

34:36.280 --> 34:41.440
They have them and they will fill you up in your guts and they will leave you satisfied

34:41.440 --> 34:42.440
and healthy.

34:42.440 --> 34:46.320
They probably really screw you on the shipping though, right?

34:46.320 --> 34:48.640
Oh, God, Travis.

34:48.640 --> 34:50.680
Did you read the fucking talking points?

34:50.680 --> 34:52.920
I can't read.

34:52.920 --> 34:53.920
It's free shipping.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.800
Because you know why?

34:55.800 --> 34:56.800
Nature's free shipping.

34:56.800 --> 35:04.120
If an acorn falls out of a tree, the tree's not like, that'll be $1.99 for Express Post.

35:04.120 --> 35:05.440
It's 50% off right now.

36:01.160 --> 36:04.440
of good stuff about running a biz.

36:04.440 --> 36:05.440
It's funny.

36:05.440 --> 36:06.440
It's insightful.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.160
I'm Tess Barker and I have good tastes and bad ideas.

36:29.160 --> 36:31.440
I'm Brandi Posey and I've been dead the whole time.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.720

36:37.720 --> 36:39.520
sometimes characters that drop in.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.520
We're weird.

We're fun.

36:41.520 --> 36:42.520
We're here.

36:42.520 --> 36:43.520
We're queer.

We're queer.

36:45.520 --> 36:46.520
We're queer.

36:46.520 --> 36:47.520
We're queer.

36:47.520 --> 36:48.520
We're queer.

36:48.520 --> 36:49.520
We're queer.

36:49.520 --> 36:50.520
We're queer.

36:50.520 --> 36:51.520
We're queer.

We're weird.

We're here.

36:56.520 --> 36:57.520
We're queer.

36:57.520 --> 36:58.520
You're confused.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.520
We're weird.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.520
We're fun.

37:00.520 --> 37:01.520
We're here.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.520

37:05.520 --> 37:06.520
See you soon.

37:06.520 --> 37:07.520
And this next message is for Brent.

37:07.520 --> 37:08.520
I'm gonna go with Tigalore.

37:08.520 --> 37:09.520
Tigalore.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.500
And it's from Alison and Alison says, Happy 30th birthday sweet cans.

37:12.500 --> 37:14.500
Love you more than pickles.

37:14.500 --> 37:15.500
I don't...

37:15.500 --> 37:16.500
It's pretty huge.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.200
I mean, if Alison likes pickles.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.580
If Allison does not like pickles,

37:19.580 --> 37:21.620
this is in no way flattering.

37:21.620 --> 37:23.940
I'm not, I'm just not okay with her

37:23.940 --> 37:26.140
sort of objectifying his body.

37:26.140 --> 37:27.200
Wait, what are?

37:27.200 --> 37:29.740
No, he's into canning.

37:29.740 --> 37:30.900
Oh, maybe that's it.

37:30.900 --> 37:32.980
He cans a lot of his own like fruits.

37:32.980 --> 37:34.500
He makes sweet cans.

37:34.500 --> 37:37.140
Cans are like breasts, right?

37:37.140 --> 37:38.060
No, it's buttocks.

37:38.060 --> 37:39.220
It's buttocks.

37:39.220 --> 37:40.300
Oh, is it?

37:40.300 --> 37:41.860
I thought so.

37:41.860 --> 37:42.680
See, that's the thing.

37:42.680 --> 37:43.620
I think it's like a blanket term

37:43.620 --> 37:45.380
that can be anything that you find good.

37:45.380 --> 37:46.660
Sweet can.

37:46.660 --> 37:49.980
Sweet cans is like your individual butt cheeks.

37:49.980 --> 37:51.420
The only way Griffin would be comfortable

37:51.420 --> 37:53.380
with objectifying Brent is if the object

37:53.380 --> 37:55.520
she's turning him into is a hot dog.

37:55.520 --> 37:56.360
Right.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.180
He seems very big on that.

37:57.180 --> 37:59.720
And if the person is specifically Jonathan Taylor Thomas,

37:59.720 --> 38:04.500
whose waxy skin is really capable of casing in those meats

38:04.500 --> 38:06.100
and like really keeping them there.

38:06.100 --> 38:09.820
Nine feet long, you gotta worry about like structural issues.

38:09.820 --> 38:14.380
JTT's tallowy, tallowy stretchy skin

38:14.380 --> 38:15.780
will just wrap right around there.

38:15.780 --> 38:18.500
And that is a crispy bite.

38:18.500 --> 38:19.940
So happy birthday, Brent.

38:19.940 --> 38:21.740
It's all downhill.

38:21.740 --> 38:23.580
I mean, it's not bad skin.

38:23.580 --> 38:25.140
It's just like-

38:25.140 --> 38:26.340
I recently got married.

38:26.340 --> 38:27.260
It's some solid skin.

38:27.260 --> 38:28.100
You know what I mean?

38:28.100 --> 38:30.220
He's a very shiny individual.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.500
I recently got married.

38:32.500 --> 38:36.820
And I hope that the two newlywed McElroys

38:36.820 --> 38:39.020
and one veteran can help me out.

38:40.220 --> 38:42.380
I am having trouble getting used to my wedding ring.

38:42.380 --> 38:44.580
It starts off fine, but after 15 minutes,

38:44.580 --> 38:46.260
it drives me crazy.

38:46.260 --> 38:48.180
I've never worn rings or watches before.

38:48.180 --> 38:50.020
This is a new thing for me.

38:51.300 --> 38:54.780
Please, how do I get used to this permanent addition

38:54.780 --> 38:55.620
to my hand?

38:55.620 --> 38:56.520
That's from David.

38:56.520 --> 38:58.280
David, here's a story.

38:58.280 --> 39:00.820
I used to be just like you.

39:00.820 --> 39:03.900
I would take off my ring to sleep because it drove me crazy.

39:03.900 --> 39:05.940
I would take off the ring to shower because,

39:05.940 --> 39:07.760
I don't know, it seemed like the thing to do.

39:07.760 --> 39:08.600
And when I was on my-

39:08.600 --> 39:10.580
I would take off my ring to cruise chicks.

39:10.580 --> 39:14.700
I would definitely take off my ring to cruise babes.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.780
I left my ring on the toilet.

39:16.780 --> 39:19.220
And this was when I was on my honeymoon.

39:19.220 --> 39:20.460
I left my ring on the toilet.

39:20.460 --> 39:22.840
And then my wife and I were walking around London.

39:22.840 --> 39:25.740
She said, do you feel like you forgot anything?

39:25.740 --> 39:27.140
And I said, no.

39:27.140 --> 39:28.500
And then she had my wedding ring.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.580
And I thought, well, I cannot be trusted

39:30.580 --> 39:31.420
to take this thing off.

39:31.420 --> 39:34.140
So I'm just gonna have to lump it.

39:34.140 --> 39:36.820
And I don't know how long it took, just a few weeks,

39:36.820 --> 39:39.420
but it feels pretty natural now.

39:39.420 --> 39:40.900
I'm pretty much used to it.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.820
Did you take your ring off to sleep

39:42.820 --> 39:46.020
in case you had a dream fantasy

39:46.020 --> 39:50.900
where you had sex with the cartoon MC Scat Cat

39:50.900 --> 39:53.420
and it'd be adultery otherwise?

39:53.420 --> 39:55.500
So you sort of take the ring off for protection?

39:55.500 --> 39:57.500
I'm just a tremendous honey

39:57.500 --> 40:01.180
that needs specific sleep conditions

40:01.180 --> 40:03.660
that even the slightest temperature variation-

40:03.660 --> 40:07.460
Oh my, it was the proverbial pee under your mattress.

40:07.460 --> 40:08.300
Yeah, it's not.

40:08.300 --> 40:09.340
Yeah, you're not that far off.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.540
But anyway, now I never take it off

40:11.540 --> 40:12.620
and I'm completely used to it.

40:12.620 --> 40:15.860
I have to take off my wedding ring when I work

40:15.860 --> 40:20.180
for the horrifying phenomenon known as gloving

40:20.180 --> 40:22.480
that can happen when working with machinery

40:22.480 --> 40:25.180
and construction where something catches your ring

40:25.180 --> 40:28.540
and then tears the skin off of your finger

40:28.540 --> 40:31.000
in one whole piece like a glove.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.860
Danny Glover comes in and bites your finger off

40:33.860 --> 40:35.680
if you're working around large pieces of machinery

40:35.680 --> 40:38.340
because he is very scared of those.

40:38.340 --> 40:40.860
For me, it gets in the way of my gaming time

40:40.860 --> 40:44.260
because I need to be pretty dexterous with these digits

40:44.260 --> 40:46.920
if I'm playing in the competitive StarCraft circuit.

40:46.920 --> 40:50.420
My APM, that's actions per minute,

40:50.420 --> 40:53.580
really do diminish if I have this big clunky,

40:53.580 --> 40:55.740
it's basically a handcuff for your finger.

40:56.980 --> 40:59.180
And I just find it really hard to stay

40:59.180 --> 41:00.460
at the top of the ladder.

41:00.460 --> 41:03.540
Are you guys used to wearing rings by now?

41:03.540 --> 41:06.180
Travis, you've worn rings I think from time to time before

41:06.180 --> 41:09.340
but Griffin, are you pretty comfortable with it?

41:09.340 --> 41:13.140
One time I bought a ring that was just like

41:13.140 --> 41:15.100
a little tribal fire thing.

41:15.100 --> 41:19.740
I did buy that at Hot Topic and I wore that,

41:19.740 --> 41:21.820
I think actually on my wedding ring finger

41:21.820 --> 41:26.820
so that actually sort of eased me into this process.

41:29.940 --> 41:31.200
I don't think I ever bought anything

41:31.200 --> 41:33.380
at Hot Topic I'm proud of now.

41:33.380 --> 41:35.220
You seem pretty proud of it in that story.

41:35.220 --> 41:37.540
Like you didn't shy away from it at all.

41:37.540 --> 41:42.540
I bought a sweet tribal fire ring that I wore with,

41:42.740 --> 41:44.220
I know you're wondering, Griffin, did you wear this

41:44.220 --> 41:46.460
at the same time as the goggles that you also bought

41:46.460 --> 41:49.020
from Hot Topic and the answer to this is yes.

41:49.020 --> 41:52.220
Yes, because there's no such thing as too much look.

41:52.220 --> 41:56.700
Don't let the fashion police convince you

41:56.700 --> 41:58.620
that there's such a thing as too much look.

41:58.620 --> 42:02.220
That's a lie.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.460
I probably would be more used to wearing my wedding ring

42:04.460 --> 42:07.780
if I would remember to put it back on.

42:07.780 --> 42:10.180
Because I have to take it off when I go on stage

42:10.180 --> 42:13.460
for Hamlet because my character is not married.

42:13.460 --> 42:18.020
And at this point I have three wedding rings

42:18.020 --> 42:19.680
because I am prone to losing things

42:19.680 --> 42:21.420
so I have three separate ones

42:21.420 --> 42:23.500
and I have left all of them at the theater.

42:23.500 --> 42:24.340
Perfect.

42:24.340 --> 42:27.200
Yeah, so I'm really nailing it on this whole ring game.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.780
You know what I mean?

42:28.780 --> 42:33.780
So far to sum up our advice from Justin,

42:33.780 --> 42:36.000
from Justin, like it or lump it.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.740
From Griffin, go back in time, buy a ring at Hot Topic

42:38.740 --> 42:39.580
and wear it.

42:39.580 --> 42:41.780
From Travis, eh, screw it.

42:42.780 --> 42:44.300
Just as long as no one notices.

42:44.300 --> 42:45.500
Yeah.

42:45.500 --> 42:48.100
Can you wear all three rings, Trav?

42:48.100 --> 42:48.940
What?

42:48.940 --> 42:51.820
Just turn your finger in like a big roll of Lifesavers?

42:51.820 --> 42:54.500
You could, oh, what if you just tattooed a ring

42:54.500 --> 42:55.860
on your finger?

42:55.860 --> 42:57.220
I love that.

42:57.220 --> 42:59.700
No, I'm sure there are people that do that.

42:59.700 --> 43:02.460
Isn't it weird how if you wear one ring

43:02.460 --> 43:05.540
it salts your game, but if you wear many rings,

43:05.540 --> 43:08.900
you're Mystery and the Pickup Artist and you're great,

43:08.900 --> 43:10.500
your game is great again.

43:10.500 --> 43:15.500
Are you suggesting that Mystery has great game?

43:16.380 --> 43:17.380
What I'm saying to you is that.

43:17.380 --> 43:18.640
What game is he good at?

43:18.640 --> 43:20.820
I'll tell you what game he's bad at, StarCraft,

43:20.820 --> 43:25.820
because you really need to have light hands.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.860
I just moved out two months ago with a new roommate,

43:28.860 --> 43:30.580
a friend of mine, not a stranger,

43:30.580 --> 43:31.780
and things are going great.

43:31.780 --> 43:34.020
He's a tidy dude who spends a lot of nights

43:34.020 --> 43:36.580
out of the apartment, sorry,

43:36.580 --> 43:37.740
but when we do cross paths,

43:37.740 --> 43:40.180
our interactions are totally pleasant.

43:40.180 --> 43:41.780
A few months before we moved in together,

43:41.780 --> 43:42.940
I started dating someone

43:42.940 --> 43:46.460
and things have rapidly gotten serious between us.

43:46.460 --> 43:48.420
Although I think it's a big step to take after four months,

43:48.420 --> 43:49.460
we would like to be living together.

43:49.460 --> 43:52.280
The question is would I be a jerk if I moved out right now

43:52.280 --> 43:54.500
after a roommate and I basically finished unpacking,

43:54.500 --> 43:55.680
or is there a certain amount of time

43:55.680 --> 43:56.860
I should wait before I bail?

43:56.860 --> 43:57.780
We have a one-year lease,

43:57.780 --> 43:58.980
but I don't think it'll be hard to find someone

43:58.980 --> 43:59.940
to take it over.

43:59.940 --> 44:00.880
What is the best way to bring up

44:00.880 --> 44:02.260
that I suddenly wanna move out

44:02.260 --> 44:03.660
so he doesn't think I'm a flake forever?

44:03.660 --> 44:07.860
That's from a mover, not a shaker.

44:07.860 --> 44:09.200
You've already answered your question

44:09.200 --> 44:11.400
and the appropriate amount of time to wait is one year,

44:11.400 --> 44:13.300
so the lease is over.

44:13.300 --> 44:15.380
I feel like it's fine if you,

44:16.540 --> 44:19.440
I feel like you have to tell your friend that like,

44:19.440 --> 44:22.360
hey, I'm about to do something rash,

44:22.360 --> 44:24.460
but it's not gonna be so rash

44:24.460 --> 44:26.340
that I'm not gonna give you time to handle it.

44:26.340 --> 44:29.500
Can you try to find another roommate?

44:29.500 --> 44:30.580
Like, I don't,

44:30.580 --> 44:32.860
listen, I'ma fuck you.

44:32.860 --> 44:33.700
That's just how it is.

44:33.700 --> 44:34.740
Like, that's just how it is,

44:34.740 --> 44:37.300
matters of the heart. I'ma fuck you right now.

44:37.300 --> 44:40.780
But I can fuck you less.

44:40.780 --> 44:42.340
It's gonna suck for you. You can lighten the load.

44:42.340 --> 44:43.620
You can lessen the burden.

44:43.620 --> 44:45.460
You tell me if I'm being a butthole.

44:45.460 --> 44:46.620
Okay.

44:46.620 --> 44:47.580
I think.

44:47.580 --> 44:48.420
Probably.

44:48.420 --> 44:49.260
Yes, you are.

44:49.260 --> 44:50.080
Okay, great.

44:51.960 --> 44:54.260
Listen, Teresa and I moved in together after four months

44:54.260 --> 44:55.940
because both of our leases were ending

44:55.940 --> 44:58.820
and it was either that or like get two separate apartments

44:58.820 --> 45:00.820
and spend the whole time in each other's houses.

45:00.820 --> 45:04.020
So I don't know that it's necessarily about the time

45:04.020 --> 45:07.100
so much as it is the inconvenience to me

45:07.100 --> 45:10.660
of like, I completely get wanting to,

45:10.660 --> 45:14.000
but there's no impetus to do it that quickly.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.720
So why not plan on doing that

45:16.720 --> 45:19.320
and then do it when your lease is up?

45:19.320 --> 45:21.420
That's like, to me, that makes perfect sense.

45:21.420 --> 45:23.740
How is that even butthole-y at all?

45:23.740 --> 45:25.980
Yeah, that's the thing is like, you wanna do it, great.

45:25.980 --> 45:27.740
So plan on doing it

45:27.740 --> 45:29.500
and then do it when your lease is up.

45:29.500 --> 45:33.220
Like if you feel that you have to rush it so fast,

45:33.220 --> 45:35.120
that's, you know, there's no need to rush it.

45:35.120 --> 45:38.060
If it's true love and you mean something, then wait.

45:38.060 --> 45:41.380
You're also rushing a great part of the dating process.

45:41.380 --> 45:42.220
I mean.

45:42.220 --> 45:43.580
The terrifying indecision

45:43.580 --> 45:45.280
where you think you wanna move in with a person,

45:45.280 --> 45:47.340
but you think about like the first time

45:47.340 --> 45:48.660
you walk in on them pooping

45:48.660 --> 45:50.900
and what that is going to do to your whole dynamic.

45:50.900 --> 45:52.980
Teresa and I have lived together for four and a half years.

45:52.980 --> 45:54.920
Now I am more married and that still has not happened

45:54.920 --> 45:56.540
because we are very careful.

45:56.540 --> 45:57.380
Yeah.

45:57.380 --> 46:00.340
There's a whole airlock system if you move through the rooms

46:00.340 --> 46:01.820
and you call out from room to room,

46:01.820 --> 46:04.420
I'm 10 feet away, I'm five feet away.

46:04.420 --> 46:05.940
We have a system of bells.

46:05.940 --> 46:07.700
It's basically a hand bell

46:07.700 --> 46:09.500
like you would use in a hand bell choir

46:09.500 --> 46:10.420
and while you're pooping,

46:10.420 --> 46:12.980
you have to constantly be ringing it.

46:12.980 --> 46:15.860
My wife has never done that.

46:15.860 --> 46:18.300
So I don't know, it's not a problem for us.

46:18.300 --> 46:19.140
That is true.

46:19.140 --> 46:21.580
That is a weird medical condition that Sydney has,

46:21.580 --> 46:23.700
which she does not number two.

46:23.700 --> 46:24.540
She doesn't. She doesn't.

46:24.540 --> 46:25.360
She doesn't remind me of frequent.

46:25.360 --> 46:28.380
But you really, if you look at all the facts,

46:28.380 --> 46:30.860
this isn't like you can't be with this person.

46:30.860 --> 46:33.460
Like if this was a grand act of romance

46:33.460 --> 46:35.780
where you had to break your lease

46:35.780 --> 46:38.020
to follow a person across the country,

46:38.020 --> 46:40.340
I think it would be rash but necessary.

46:40.340 --> 46:43.740
Right now what you're doing is just it's rash

46:43.740 --> 46:45.180
and it could be hurtful

46:45.180 --> 46:48.000
and it would be really hard to walk back

46:48.000 --> 46:49.660
if it doesn't pan out.

46:49.660 --> 46:51.860
After like another eight months,

46:51.860 --> 46:55.180
assuming you started dated when your lease began,

46:55.180 --> 46:57.580
it's kind of hard to figure that out.

46:57.580 --> 47:00.860
I mean, I think you're in a good situation.

47:00.860 --> 47:01.700
Like run with it.

47:01.700 --> 47:06.700
You need to appreciate this unicorn that you've ensnared

47:06.980 --> 47:09.080
in the form of a roommate

47:09.080 --> 47:12.940
that is not just an absolute shithead.

47:12.940 --> 47:14.700
Also scientifically speaking,

47:14.700 --> 47:16.340
or rather statistically speaking,

47:18.400 --> 47:22.420
by month six of living with this roommate,

47:22.420 --> 47:27.420
it is undeniable that you would do anything to fuck them.

47:28.140 --> 47:30.260
Like you, things are going good now.

47:30.260 --> 47:32.260
I'm really happy to hear it.

47:32.260 --> 47:34.620
You will hate this person.

47:34.620 --> 47:37.640
Okay, so when you said fuck then.

47:37.640 --> 47:40.900
No, I mean you will hate this person in two months,

47:40.900 --> 47:43.020
guaranteed, no question about it.

47:43.020 --> 47:45.020
No one has ever lived with someone

47:45.020 --> 47:48.060
that they weren't like dating or married to

47:48.060 --> 47:49.980
that has not wanted the other person

47:49.980 --> 47:52.820
to in some small way die.

47:52.820 --> 47:54.620
So if you just wait,

47:54.620 --> 47:56.080
then you're gonna be able to move out

47:56.080 --> 47:57.580
and feel great about it.

47:57.580 --> 47:59.300
But right now you're gonna carry a lot of guilt.

47:59.300 --> 48:02.560
You have to let this thing run its terrible, terrible course.

48:02.560 --> 48:04.660
And let me throw this out.

48:04.660 --> 48:07.880
Your boyfriend's probably gonna be over at your place

48:07.880 --> 48:09.740
most nights anyways.

48:09.740 --> 48:11.900
It's not like you're not gonna see each other.

48:11.900 --> 48:14.280
So I would say just after a while,

48:14.280 --> 48:16.560
maybe after like six or eight months,

48:16.560 --> 48:18.380
you're not gonna notice the difference anyways

48:18.380 --> 48:20.100
and then your lease ends

48:20.100 --> 48:22.140
and you guys are gonna move in together.

48:22.140 --> 48:24.700
Eight months is gonna pass really quickly.

48:24.700 --> 48:28.060
Yeah, and then eight years and then 80 years

48:28.060 --> 48:29.900
and then that was your life.

48:29.900 --> 48:31.740
There is no reason to rush this relationship.

48:31.740 --> 48:34.980
No, there is a reason to rush into this next Yahoo.

48:34.980 --> 48:37.280
This Yahoo was sent in by gotta catch em all.

48:38.160 --> 48:39.700
Okay, mom.

48:39.700 --> 48:42.460
Thank you, it's by Yahoo answer user Janine who asks,

48:42.460 --> 48:46.200
will I get arrested for an internet fight here?

48:46.200 --> 48:48.220
Moments ago I got into an internet fight

48:48.220 --> 48:50.420
with someone, I'm seriously trying to apologize

48:50.420 --> 48:52.100
to this person because I seriously don't know

48:52.100 --> 48:53.280
what came over me.

48:53.280 --> 48:54.700
Will I get arrested for the fight?

48:54.700 --> 48:56.780
Because to be honest with you, I'm afraid.

48:56.780 --> 48:59.420
Like really, I'm seriously crying my eyes out.

48:59.420 --> 49:01.160
That's how afraid and sorry I am.

49:02.340 --> 49:03.660
What did you do?

49:03.660 --> 49:05.540
What did you do on the internet?

49:05.540 --> 49:07.460
What could you possibly have done?

49:07.460 --> 49:09.460
They were like, oh no, I took this too far.

49:09.460 --> 49:10.500
Not again.

49:10.500 --> 49:11.540
This is a bridge too far,

49:11.540 --> 49:14.100
I'm gonna have to change my internet name.

49:14.100 --> 49:18.320
I don't even think, you know like physically harm somebody

49:18.320 --> 49:19.900
but sometimes emotional harm.

49:19.900 --> 49:22.600
This is what's so fucked up about our legal system, right?

49:22.600 --> 49:26.420
If Travis and I are at Cheddar's

49:26.420 --> 49:29.100
and I punch Travis in the jaw,

49:29.100 --> 49:31.340
then that's assault, right?

49:31.340 --> 49:33.180
Or battery, or both.

49:33.180 --> 49:37.300
And he can file charges and I can go to prison for that.

49:37.300 --> 49:39.340
Correct, and I would.

49:39.340 --> 49:40.340
And he would do that.

49:40.340 --> 49:41.220
And he has.

49:41.220 --> 49:42.900
And he has done that.

49:42.900 --> 49:45.180
And that's why I'm. That's in the past.

49:45.180 --> 49:46.020
I'm not allowed in.

49:46.020 --> 49:47.540
Why are you dreshing this up?

49:47.540 --> 49:50.660
I'm not allowed in any Cheddar's anymore

49:50.660 --> 49:52.540
for this exact reason.

49:52.540 --> 49:55.380
I'm actually legally only allowed to be in Cheddar's.

49:55.380 --> 49:57.020
I'm recording from a Cheddar's right now.

49:57.020 --> 49:58.220
It's the only place I'm safe from.

49:58.220 --> 50:00.820
Travis is in Cheddar's house arrest.

50:00.820 --> 50:03.460
It's the only place he's safe from my wrath.

50:05.460 --> 50:09.260
If Travis leaves the Cheddar's, I have an alert.

50:09.260 --> 50:12.000
He's wearing a reverse ankle bracelet

50:12.000 --> 50:13.620
that will tell me when he's left the Cheddar's.

50:13.620 --> 50:18.300
I will come down on him like a fucking albatross.

50:18.300 --> 50:21.140
Luckily, there's a set of tubes, underground tubes

50:21.140 --> 50:23.300
that connect all the Cheddar's in America

50:23.300 --> 50:25.740
so that I'm able to travel from place to place.

50:25.740 --> 50:27.900
It's the underground Cheddar's railroad.

50:28.860 --> 50:30.580
Is the oven keeping me safe?

50:30.580 --> 50:32.420
Travis is still working out a plan

50:32.420 --> 50:34.260
to get Griffin to punch him at a cinema arc

50:34.260 --> 50:35.980
so he can see 12 Years of the Slay.

50:35.980 --> 50:36.920
Right.

50:36.920 --> 50:39.620
Okay, so back to the story.

50:39.620 --> 50:41.740
I punch Travis in the jaw at a Cheddar's

50:41.740 --> 50:43.320
and I went to prison for that.

50:45.580 --> 50:49.720
If I say, but if I tell Travis like,

50:49.720 --> 50:51.760
hey, you're looking a little doughy,

50:51.760 --> 50:53.780
then I have done an emotional harm to Travis

50:53.780 --> 50:57.520
that I think rivals the jaw punch that I did to him.

50:57.520 --> 50:58.360
Although I did punch him.

50:58.360 --> 50:59.940
Well, what are your jaw punches, certainly?

50:59.940 --> 51:00.780
Yeah.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.500
I can't go to jail for that, can I?

51:05.500 --> 51:07.860
It's assault of a different kind.

51:07.860 --> 51:11.820
I hurt him, not in his jaw, but in his heart.

51:12.780 --> 51:16.180
Like, I think that that's probably a prisonable offense.

51:17.380 --> 51:20.780
So your argument is that we should begin

51:20.780 --> 51:23.600
arresting people for saying hurtful things.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.620
Right, and because you can't punch someone

51:25.620 --> 51:28.260
through the internet, but you can tell someone

51:28.260 --> 51:31.900
they're looking a little Marlon Brando later years,

51:31.900 --> 51:36.260
doughy, then you should go to jail for that.

51:36.260 --> 51:37.100
Does that make sense?

51:37.100 --> 51:38.740
Am I making any sense right now?

51:38.740 --> 51:41.740
No, I completely understand what you're saying.

51:41.740 --> 51:43.780
But it would have to be like a separate prison

51:43.780 --> 51:44.700
because you don't want to be the guy

51:44.700 --> 51:46.620
who rolls up to prison on the first day

51:46.620 --> 51:48.940
and somebody's like, yeah, I stabbed three dudes

51:48.940 --> 51:50.580
when I was robbing a store.

51:50.580 --> 51:51.420
What did you do?

51:51.420 --> 51:53.780
I was like, I told somebody that they were looking

51:53.780 --> 51:55.720
really tired and had crows feet.

51:55.720 --> 51:57.420
Yeah, you know, stabbing three dudes

51:57.420 --> 52:00.100
while robbing a store really is the perfect crime.

52:00.100 --> 52:05.100
You really got like, in the crimes per minute ratio,

52:05.100 --> 52:08.900
like you did actually pretty great there.

52:08.900 --> 52:11.000
Yeah, I stabbed three dudes while I was robbing

52:11.000 --> 52:13.340
a liquor store, and then I turned to the proprietor

52:13.340 --> 52:17.340
of the liquor store and I said, hey fat ass, bye.

52:17.340 --> 52:18.180
So yeah, I'm here.

52:18.180 --> 52:20.180
And because you called him fat, you got arrested.

52:20.180 --> 52:22.340
I got 15 years for the stabbings,

52:22.340 --> 52:24.260
another eight for the robbery,

52:24.260 --> 52:27.460
and then I got 35 years for saying he was fat.

52:27.460 --> 52:29.660
We really need to take a look at this system.

52:29.660 --> 52:32.180
What really, the bad thing about this system

52:32.180 --> 52:34.660
is that, you know, it's gonna be a light sentence.

52:34.660 --> 52:36.780
It's gonna be a slap on the wrist, right?

52:36.780 --> 52:40.220
So the person goes in, they serve their time,

52:40.220 --> 52:41.820
but then they're allowed to call you fat

52:41.820 --> 52:44.020
whenever they want to, the double jeopardy.

52:45.660 --> 52:47.940
You didn't even consider that.

52:47.940 --> 52:51.160
I would like to see those scared straight meanings though.

52:51.160 --> 52:53.180
You think it's fun to tell your friend

52:53.180 --> 52:55.060
that his hair looks bad today?

52:55.060 --> 52:58.140
I told my friend that once, now I don't have hair.

52:58.140 --> 53:00.340
Because the barbers are really bad in prison.

53:00.340 --> 53:02.480
You guys think you're tough, you're just a bunch of pussies.

53:02.480 --> 53:03.460
Oh, wait, shit!

53:03.460 --> 53:05.100
Ah, damn it, god damn it.

53:05.100 --> 53:06.300
That's another six months.

53:06.300 --> 53:08.300
Well, son of a bitch.

53:08.300 --> 53:09.460
I'm so stupid.

53:09.460 --> 53:10.420
No, wait, fuck!

53:10.420 --> 53:13.260
Ah, shit, god damn it.

53:13.260 --> 53:15.580
Listen, this has been a lot of fun,

53:15.580 --> 53:18.420
but I have talked all I'm willing to.

53:18.420 --> 53:22.180
I have helped all the people that I physically can today.

53:22.180 --> 53:24.280
I've grown weary.

53:24.280 --> 53:26.420
I've entered, by the way, as I age,

53:26.420 --> 53:31.100
I've entered now my like, my James Brown phase

53:31.100 --> 53:33.620
where after all the advice, I'm physically

53:33.620 --> 53:34.780
and spiritually exhausted.

53:34.780 --> 53:36.860
I needed someone to come put a cape on me

53:36.860 --> 53:38.460
so I could make my way off stage.

53:38.460 --> 53:41.100
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

53:41.100 --> 53:46.100

53:58.900 --> 54:02.700
Fred Trunks, Justin Schmorman, Scuttlebutt, so many others.

54:02.700 --> 54:05.220
Big, big thank you to Tyler Crowley,

54:05.220 --> 54:07.780
who, excitingly, while we were recording this episode,

54:07.780 --> 54:11.420
just released a new episode of his Mabim-baminations.

54:11.420 --> 54:12.740
Oh, man, sweet.

54:12.740 --> 54:16.560
I know, animated bits from My Brother, My Brother and Me,

54:16.560 --> 54:20.800
and you can find his Twitter at Agent O'Hara.

54:23.180 --> 54:24.740
Oh, and thanks to Megan Knott.

54:24.740 --> 54:29.180
She made the My Brother, My Brother and Me cat,

54:29.180 --> 54:31.560
us as cats, GIF.

54:31.560 --> 54:34.180
We tweeted it a day or two ago.

54:34.180 --> 54:37.300
It's both mesmerizing and adorable,

54:37.300 --> 54:39.900
and my favorite thing about it is that my cat

54:39.900 --> 54:41.480
has little cat genitals.

54:43.100 --> 54:45.740
You can also find, by the way, that cartoon is on YouTube.

54:45.740 --> 54:50.620
Just search for Crotoons, C-R-O-W-toons.

54:50.620 --> 54:52.660

Thanks to John Roderick in the long winter

55:22.940 --> 55:24.420
for the use of the theme song It's a Departure

55:24.420 --> 55:26.340
off the album Puttin' the Days to Bed.

55:26.340 --> 55:27.820
That's the music we use.

55:27.820 --> 55:30.100
You can find it on iTunes.

55:30.100 --> 55:35.100
You can find it on other services like iTunes, probably.

55:36.460 --> 55:38.500
And that's gonna do it for us?

55:38.500 --> 55:40.700
Oh, and we're gonna have a special guest

55:41.620 --> 55:43.420
in the next week or two on the show.

55:43.420 --> 55:47.300
We're gonna have a, I'm calling it a guest-bert,

55:47.300 --> 55:48.340
but I think that-

55:48.340 --> 55:49.300
I like that.

55:49.300 --> 55:50.400
I mean, it's not- You like that?

55:50.400 --> 55:52.420
It's not like phonetically perfect.

55:52.420 --> 55:54.380
No, it's not pleasing in any way phonetically,

55:54.380 --> 55:55.700
but I like it.

55:56.540 --> 55:59.740
And this guest-bert is coming on to talk,

55:59.740 --> 56:02.220
if you have any advice on-

56:02.220 --> 56:03.060
Or need advice.

56:03.060 --> 56:05.060
Gays or lesbians in the media.

56:05.060 --> 56:07.700
That is what they are guest-bert on.

56:07.700 --> 56:09.820
So if you have any advice-related questions

56:09.820 --> 56:12.140
or just, you know, any kind of questions really,

56:12.140 --> 56:13.980
I don't wanna fence you in.

56:13.980 --> 56:17.460
Try to include guest-bert in your subject line

56:17.460 --> 56:19.940
just so we can see how you thought to spell it

56:19.940 --> 56:21.140
because I'm kind of curious.

56:21.140 --> 56:23.260
I am also curious about that.

56:23.260 --> 56:24.100
All right.

56:24.100 --> 56:25.320
Final Yahoo, you ready?

56:25.320 --> 56:26.580
Yeah.

56:26.580 --> 56:28.020

56:31.020 --> 56:31.860

56:31.860 --> 56:33.920
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Abby, who asks,

56:35.720 --> 56:38.180
is it weird I'm really attracted

56:38.180 --> 56:40.120

56:40.120 --> 56:42.860
I'm Justin McElroy.

56:46.640 --> 56:47.480
Kiss your dads.

56:47.480 --> 56:50.060
Oh, air on the lips.

56:50.060 --> 56:52.060
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
