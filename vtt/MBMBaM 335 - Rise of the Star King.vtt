00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.880 --> 00:49.200
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:49.200 --> 00:58.000
Calamites 2016 Super Duper Spectacular. My name is Justin Tyler McElroy, Christmas boy.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.840
My name is Travis Patrick McElroy, the Yule Man.

01:03.280 --> 01:09.680
Griffin Tyler McElroy. Boys, what's that coming? Boys, what's that coming down to the chimbly?

01:10.880 --> 01:15.680
Please turn your eyes towards the chimbly and see what's coming down. It's a reindeer.

01:16.800 --> 01:17.760
No, not like this.

01:17.760 --> 01:25.360
Oh, no, he's done. They should not be vertical like this and pinned in a chimbly. This is not

01:25.360 --> 01:30.320
good. Oh, God. Should we call animal control or take care of it ourselves? I think we should

01:30.320 --> 01:38.000
call Santa's fat A to get down here. Oh, it's getting much no cursing. Yeah, it's special,

01:38.000 --> 01:47.680
very special. There's a whole platform on Hulu of those, I think it's called streaming Christmas,

01:47.680 --> 01:54.640
and it's in the vein of those Yule log videos that just go and you pretend that,

01:54.640 --> 01:57.680
oh, it's so funny, and you pretend to turn them on and think that it's funny and cool,

01:57.680 --> 02:04.080
but really it's just a boring log that is on fire for a while. This streaming Christmas platform,

02:04.080 --> 02:10.480
this production company has cracked into something new, and that is other long form explorations

02:10.480 --> 02:18.160
of the genre. Me and Rachel and her folks and Henry last night, we watched one that is called

02:18.160 --> 02:22.560
Stuck Santa that I'd like to talk to you about at length if you'll give me the stage for a little

02:22.560 --> 02:30.880
bit. Yes, do we need to pass emotion? No, it's just going to be a little bit of a dive. It's a

02:30.880 --> 02:37.360
48 minute long movie, and it says when you load it up, it says Stuck Santa, and then in parentheses,

02:37.360 --> 02:43.280
full film, and film is gracious because all it is is it's like one of those fireplaces and you

02:43.280 --> 02:47.920
think a Yule log's going to start crackling, but no, you just see two feet pop down, and then for

02:47.920 --> 02:58.880
48 minutes, you hear a man just sort of vamp like, oh, no. Oh, what have I become? Oh,

02:59.680 --> 03:05.840
that didn't help. I'm still very stuck. Oh, my diarrhea's acting up again.

03:05.840 --> 03:12.800
And then just to get into spoiler territory, there's no hot snakes whatsoever, but at about the,

03:12.800 --> 03:18.720
I want to say 39 minute mark, presents start falling down, so I'm not sure how the physics

03:18.720 --> 03:24.720
of that work. How are you stuck and encompassing the full space of the chimney, but also your

03:24.720 --> 03:30.560
presents are coming down. Do you have them up your booty, Santa Claus? No, I'm really glad you brought

03:30.560 --> 03:35.760
this up, Griffin, because I do have one question. I have not seen it. Yeah, sure. Stylistically,

03:35.760 --> 03:44.400
yeah. Attitudinally, yeah. Is it for children? Is it for adults? It is for perverts,

03:45.680 --> 03:50.320
because I would like to tell you the ending of Stuck Santa, and that is all of these presents

03:50.320 --> 03:55.760
have fallen down, and you still just see his stupid legs, and he says like, oh, no,

03:56.960 --> 04:04.640
and then the words the end appear, and the video comes to a halt, so I guess he is dead,

04:04.640 --> 04:10.400
and if he's not dead, then Christmas. How are you going to withhold that climax from us? If he's not

04:10.400 --> 04:17.040
dead, how did he get out? How did he get out? But I think he doesn't. At the very least, Santa works

04:17.040 --> 04:22.400
on a pretty tight schedule. If he does get out later, that's 48 minutes of primo delivery time.

04:22.400 --> 04:29.040
That's like all of Eastern Europe just ain't getting it no more. No presents for you,

04:29.040 --> 04:33.600
Eastern Europe. That was your 48 minute window. But at the worst case scenario, Christmas

04:33.600 --> 04:37.600
is not happening this year, because Santa went and got himself stuck.

04:38.320 --> 04:43.680
Griffin, did you wait until the post-credit scene when Nick Fury showed up?

04:43.680 --> 04:46.880
Nick Fury showed up, and he's like, I want you to join me. Oh, you've been stuck in that chimbly

04:46.880 --> 04:52.320
for 48 minutes? You can't even do your job tonight? You know what? I'm going to pass.

04:52.320 --> 04:56.640
Thank you, Santa Claus. Thank you, Santa. He dies at the end. We were watching it,

04:56.640 --> 05:00.960
and then his feet are going to pop out the top, and he's like, off I go, back on my magical-

05:00.960 --> 05:06.720
No, he's just dead in there. He dies in there. Dead. They should call it dead Santa.

05:07.360 --> 05:11.920
But is that the prequels of the Santa Claus? Did Tim Allen show up in the Stuck Santa movie?

05:12.800 --> 05:16.320
The thing Griffin didn't mention is that for the entirety of the hour,

05:16.320 --> 05:21.680
Tim Allen is in the bottom right hand corner, just like, oh no, I don't have time for this.

05:21.680 --> 05:28.800
I mean, here's the thing. If he does pass away from Earth in the chimbly, then there is no

05:28.800 --> 05:40.160
recipient of the Santa Claus-y with magic contract to pass to. And so what's it going to do? Where's

05:40.160 --> 05:43.200
that good, good spirit go? Where's the mantle passed to?

05:43.200 --> 05:46.960
Where's the mantle passed to? Now we've got these two skeletal legs.

05:46.960 --> 05:50.880
He's stuck inside the mantle, and there's nowhere for the mantle to go to.

05:50.880 --> 06:00.400
Exactly. Can you imagine being one of the producers of the Santa Claus, and you show up

06:00.400 --> 06:06.880
at Disney HQ, and they're like, listen, we love Tim Allen. We love Santa Claus. Can you give us

06:06.880 --> 06:14.880
the sort of the big beats in the story? We don't need a whole, like a deep dive. Just give us the

06:14.880 --> 06:20.880
big beats of the story. And these guys have to look them dead in the eye and say, well, first,

06:22.000 --> 06:27.920
Santa dies, like of old age and happy in his bed. No, no, Tim Allen kills him.

06:27.920 --> 06:32.960
Tim Allen does kill him to death from Earth. So the first thing we see is Santa dies

06:32.960 --> 06:39.680
because of Tim Allen's negligence. As always, the Santa mantle passes via death.

06:39.680 --> 06:44.640
And this is important. A boy does see it. A boy does see Santa's dead, dead body.

06:44.640 --> 06:48.880
A boy watches Santa die. That's the first image of the movie.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.720
Listen, it's going to get worse before it gets better.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.240
He then does put on the dead man's clothes.

06:54.240 --> 07:03.280
He puts on the dead man's clothes, still covered in his stink. It's like watching somebody just

07:03.280 --> 07:07.280
break into a funeral home and just start taking things off that corpse.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.960
I am glad, though, because in the original first draft of the Santa Claus,

07:10.960 --> 07:16.320
the naked body of the dead Santa was just left in the snow. They leave the naked man's body.

07:16.320 --> 07:19.760
They did make them change that. I'm like, OK, well, the body is going to need to

07:19.760 --> 07:24.320
magically disappear or whatever. Like, oh, OK, sure, sure, sure. We do get to still kill him,

07:24.320 --> 07:29.840
though. We do get that satisfaction. When this bit started, I thought you were going to say,

07:29.840 --> 07:36.480
can you imagine being one of the producers of Stuck Santa and just kind of kicking it for 48

07:36.480 --> 07:43.920
minutes while an actor vamps and probably vapes up there? Because you only see the legs.

07:44.480 --> 07:49.920
Hey, I have a weird thing. I just wanted to mention to everybody that occurred to me. As

07:49.920 --> 07:53.440
long as we're talking about holiday entertainment, this is a Kaila Nights episode, and we've got

07:53.440 --> 07:57.280
questions and stuff that we'll answer. But honestly, we don't have any sponsors this

07:57.280 --> 08:02.560
week for some reason, so we're doing this one for free. So listen, just calm down, OK?

08:02.560 --> 08:10.960
The Home Alone franchise is a delight. I was playing Home Alone on iTunes, and then I noticed

08:10.960 --> 08:19.600
something very unusual. Home Alone on the Rotten Tomatoes website has a 55% fresh rating. You ever

08:19.600 --> 08:25.360
heard anything like that? That's wild. It's Home Alone. It is Home Alone. Now here, this gets much

08:25.360 --> 08:35.280
more buck wild. Home Alone 2 has a 24% fresh rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website, and that's

08:35.280 --> 08:41.680
based on several critics. It's based on a lot of critics, and it's 24%. Wait, that's the critic

08:41.680 --> 08:47.040
rating, not like people rating? That's the critics rating. The freshness of this film is less than

08:47.040 --> 08:52.240
a quarter fresh, is over 75% rotten, according to the critics. Here's where it gets like,

08:52.240 --> 08:58.240
like, you lose me. I mean, you already lost me, for sure. But like, I come back in, and I'm like,

08:59.280 --> 09:07.680
how are things going? And then you lose me again. Because Home Alone 3 has a 27% freshness. In the

09:07.680 --> 09:12.480
mind of America's, you can't trust critics, apparently. No. Because in the mind of this

09:12.480 --> 09:21.440
planet's critics, Home Alone 3 was a better film than Home Alone 2. Like, get bent. Seriously.

09:21.440 --> 09:26.400
I can explain 2. I can explain Home Alone 2. 25% around there was-

09:26.400 --> 09:27.520
24%.

09:27.520 --> 09:33.920
24%. Well, the math almost adds up, but that's actually based on only four reviews. One of them

09:33.920 --> 09:39.440
was Village Voice, and they loved the dang picture. And the other three were by Joe Pesci and Daniel

09:39.440 --> 09:45.520
Stern and Greg Pesci, Joe's dad. And they hated how they hated the treatment of these two crooks.

09:45.520 --> 09:54.480
The only thing I can assume, Justin, is that the nation's critics desperately crave child murder

09:54.480 --> 09:55.280
in movies.

09:55.280 --> 09:55.600
I guess.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.640
Oh, interesting.

09:56.640 --> 10:01.840
And they thought that Home Alone 2 promised what they did not receive in Home Alone 1.

10:01.840 --> 10:07.120
And maybe in Home Alone 3, which I have not seen, the kid dies. So it's slightly better.

10:07.120 --> 10:07.840
It's a little bit better.

10:07.840 --> 10:13.200
I haven't seen it. Cannot confirm. I actually just watched Ernest Hayes' Christmas for the

10:13.200 --> 10:14.480
first time in a long time.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.440
96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

10:17.440 --> 10:18.320
Believe it or not.

10:18.320 --> 10:26.400
Do you know what the main conceit of Ernest Hayes' Christmas is? Santa's going senile and has to

10:26.400 --> 10:31.760
pass the- he can't remember things anymore. He can't remember all the kids, and he can't remember

10:31.760 --> 10:37.520
what they asked for, and he doesn't have the magic anymore. And he waited- he says numerous times

10:37.520 --> 10:44.000
that he waited too long to pass the mantle on to the next person. So he has to find someone to be

10:44.000 --> 10:48.160
Santa real quick before time runs out.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.920
Hey kids, how's your movie?

10:49.920 --> 10:50.720
How's your movie going?

10:50.720 --> 10:51.680
How's your movie, kids?

10:51.680 --> 10:56.000
He's getting real old, huh? Kind of like G-Paw and G-Ma are doing in real life.

10:57.360 --> 11:04.560
I was going to antagonize Travis by having Tim Curry say cheese pizza in the headphones,

11:06.000 --> 11:13.200
but I couldn't find the clip, so I searched YouTube Tim Curry cheese pizza, and I'm very proud to

11:13.200 --> 11:18.560
announce that the first result is Tim Curry being unfamiliar with the concept of pizza,

11:18.560 --> 11:21.920
but the second and third are both my brother and my brother.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.200
Yeah, all right.

11:23.200 --> 11:23.680
We did it.

11:23.680 --> 11:23.920
We did it.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.000
Should we-

11:26.000 --> 11:27.280
Cheese pizza.

11:27.280 --> 11:32.880
Cheese. Fresh cheese pizza. Can we do some questions, please?

11:34.240 --> 11:34.560
Yes.

11:35.360 --> 11:40.560
You're loading up the clip now, Justin. God, I can hear the Googling happen inside this podcast.

11:40.560 --> 11:45.600
I'm not loading up any clip. Okay. Here's the first question.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.280
It's playing in my ears.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.640
Yeah, I know it is.

11:48.640 --> 11:52.480
Do you hear it? I don't hear it. Do you hear it? I don't hear anything.

11:53.120 --> 11:53.920
It's in my ears.

11:54.640 --> 11:58.320
I have a friend who carefully unwraps gifts rather than tearing into them.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.160
When I asked why she did this-

12:00.160 --> 12:03.040
You got to stop playing it. I know you're still doing it over and over again.

12:03.040 --> 12:03.680
I'm not doing any-

12:06.080 --> 12:07.200
Cheese pizza.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.400
Cheese pizza.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.600
Why I asked- Okay, I'll actually start again.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.280
Thank you. I can't hear the question.

12:15.440 --> 12:19.360
Please stop it. It's still playing.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.400
Now it's stopped.

12:20.400 --> 12:20.640
Okay.

12:22.320 --> 12:22.800
Hold on.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.160
It started again inadvertently.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.800
This is poison. This is audio poison.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.920
No sponsors, baby.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.400
I have a friend who carefully unwraps gifts rather than tearing into them.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.520
Travis is texting now.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.960
No, I'm looking at the questions on my phone.

12:34.960 --> 12:35.440
Okay.

12:35.440 --> 12:40.800
When I asked why she did this, she told me it was so she could reuse the wrapping paper.

12:40.800 --> 12:41.280
Unforgivable.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.400
I guess it's her present to do with what she likes,

12:44.400 --> 12:48.000
but I feel a little robbed of the joy of watching someone excitedly rip it up like a kid.

12:48.800 --> 12:52.400
Is there a way I can wrap things she'll have no choice?

12:52.960 --> 12:54.800
And that's from Gift Misgiving.

12:54.800 --> 12:58.160
Let me first undo one foul that you have there.

12:58.160 --> 13:01.680
It is not just her gift. You are right in the second part.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.560
The opening of it is a gift to you.

13:04.560 --> 13:07.680
Otherwise, you would just hand people unwrapped presents.

13:07.680 --> 13:08.480
Correct.

13:08.480 --> 13:09.520
Oh, yeah.

13:09.520 --> 13:14.400
The reveal is part of what you get for getting someone that moment when they go,

13:15.120 --> 13:20.560
and if they're slowly revealing it like Angels and Demons,

13:20.560 --> 13:24.080
you know, Da Vinci code puzzle where they get one inch at a time,

13:24.640 --> 13:25.920
that's not fun for you.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.680
That's boring.

13:27.680 --> 13:28.960
You want to reveal.

13:28.960 --> 13:32.480
Unless they do like sexy burlesque music while they unwrap it.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.560
Yes, and there's tassels on the blender.

13:35.840 --> 13:39.680
I don't know if there's anything that I find sadder.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.600
I know a few people that do this.

13:41.600 --> 13:46.960
I don't know there's much I find sadder than thinking of someone on like December 24th

13:47.600 --> 13:48.960
nestled around the tree,

13:48.960 --> 13:55.440
just slowly thumbing through a sticky pile of dirty wrapping paper.

13:55.440 --> 14:00.240
Just marking out the names on the sticky tags like now it's from me.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.400
Oh, that one's got a little tear.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.320
I guess back to the drawing board.

14:04.320 --> 14:05.840
I got some old chewing gum here.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.520
I could fix it a little bit.

14:07.520 --> 14:08.720
Counterpoint to this.

14:09.600 --> 14:16.080
If I got a present from somebody with some genuine elf paper,

14:16.080 --> 14:17.680
I would lose my gourd.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.000
My gourd would fly off into the fireplace.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.160
It would be insane.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.760
Has anyone seen Griffin's gourd?

14:23.760 --> 14:24.400
It's stuck with say a bird.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.280
It is gone.

14:25.280 --> 14:31.200
He opened that dope elf wrapping paper from 1954 and he lost his mind.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.400
The original elf run.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.880
The original elf when he was just a racist comic character.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.240
Sponsored by Colgate.

14:37.200 --> 14:42.160
Listen, I think Griffin has created a false dichotomy.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.960
We're not talking about collectible wrapping paper here.

14:44.960 --> 14:48.400
It's not like, yeah, if my gift comes wrapped in the Magna Carta,

14:48.400 --> 14:49.920
I'm going to be delicate with it.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.600
That's not what we're talking about.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.680
We're talking about preserving wrapping paper.

14:53.680 --> 14:57.120
I guess if that's important to them, you should just stop wrapping it

14:57.120 --> 14:59.440
and say you're just going to steal the paper anyway.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.640
It's my paper and I decide what gets done with it.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.760
I'm not going to give you more to use.

15:03.760 --> 15:04.800
You can steal it from me.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.720
This is this is this is wild.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.680
We don't have this problem anymore and you guys want to have this problem with us

15:11.680 --> 15:16.480
because I most of the gifts that Rachel and I got you all is from Amazon

15:16.480 --> 15:19.280
and they just do those weird bags.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.320
Here's your very nice.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.440
Here's you in those bags.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.760
They look so festive underneath the tree, actually.

15:23.760 --> 15:27.280
They make it look like old timey and stuff and you can reuse them.

15:27.280 --> 15:27.760
They're great.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.040
Just give this person gifts and gift bags.

15:31.040 --> 15:36.080
That's like inherently supposed to be reused, right?

15:36.080 --> 15:39.760
Like, no, I don't want to because that's that takes a gift.

15:39.760 --> 15:42.320
Here's the process of opening up a wrapped paper gift.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.240
And this is an important thing for us to dive into

15:45.360 --> 15:49.120
because it's like, oh, man, you put in some work getting this origami going right.

15:49.120 --> 15:53.120
You tear, tear, tear, tear, tear, tear, unfold, tear, rip, rip, rip, rip, rip.

15:53.120 --> 15:53.600
Good.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.320
Oh, wow.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.200
It's Jumanji.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.400
If you are on DVD on blue.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.840
Oh, I thought you meant the game.

15:59.840 --> 16:00.480
Oh, okay.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.920
We're going to spiral into a torture game.

16:01.920 --> 16:06.800
It's a combo pack of the blue of the board game that had the weird red bubble on it

16:06.800 --> 16:08.880
that you had to, like, slide the cards into.

16:08.880 --> 16:12.320
And then it was like, just like the man, just like the movie magic.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.680
It's not like the movie magic.

16:13.680 --> 16:17.280
Like, it's just like a weird red pattern that gets decoded with like,

16:17.280 --> 16:18.960
there's no elephants coming out.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.400
The board game, Kyle.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.920
But thank you for the gift anyway.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.560
So that's the process of opening a wrap gift.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.080
If it's in a gift bag, here's the process.

16:29.040 --> 16:29.680
Ah, cool.

16:29.680 --> 16:30.400
Jumanji.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.160
Like, it's the magic.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.040
Just make it longer.

16:35.760 --> 16:39.840
Make the magic last longer and wrap the thing up.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.760
If you want the magic to last longer,

16:42.320 --> 16:46.560
then you should be totally jized with their unwrapping approach.

16:46.560 --> 16:47.920
Let me throw this at you.

16:47.920 --> 16:52.960
So wrap, then another layer of wrap, and then a third layer of wrap.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.520
And when they unwrap it all, you got them wrapping paper.

16:56.720 --> 17:01.440
I got you a bundle, a year, a lifetime supply of wrapping paper.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.080
That's good.

17:02.720 --> 17:03.120
That's good.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.240
I like this.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.840
Then you have it, so they have no...

17:05.840 --> 17:08.160
Oh, give them enough wrapping paper that the next year,

17:08.160 --> 17:10.640
when they like, try to start saving it, I'm like, no.

17:11.360 --> 17:12.720
You don't need any more.

17:12.720 --> 17:13.840
Flood them with wrapping.

17:13.840 --> 17:15.440
Ruin them with wrapping paper.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.800
You don't want any more of this.

17:16.800 --> 17:21.120
If you did just continue to wrap levels of wrapping paper,

17:22.160 --> 17:24.240
it would really put them to the test.

17:24.240 --> 17:24.560
Yeah.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.600
Hey, tough guy, you think you like to slowly, meticulously unwrap?

17:27.600 --> 17:29.440
Let's see how long this holds out.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.400
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

17:32.400 --> 17:33.200
Yeah, please.

17:33.200 --> 17:33.840
Yahoo!

17:34.960 --> 17:35.840
You know that one?

17:35.840 --> 17:36.880
Yeah, nice.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.480
Pets.com.

17:40.640 --> 17:41.600
Here we go.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.280
It's sent by Morgan Davey.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.320
Keep it wavy, bud.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.760
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.000
Chaz Van Blom.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.560
I think we've read one of this user's.

17:50.560 --> 17:51.520
Wow.

17:51.520 --> 17:52.480
That sounds familiar.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.440
And you know what that means.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.840
We've officially, we can't use this platform anymore.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.920
So Chaz Van Blom asks,

17:59.920 --> 18:03.840
how should I prep as Santa Claus?

18:03.840 --> 18:06.720
I'm a returning Santa Claus to my local region.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.040
My next door neighbor has already asked me to show up

18:09.040 --> 18:10.560
to their family's Christmas party.

18:10.560 --> 18:11.680
I think Christmas Eve.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.920
You should definitely iron that out.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.920
Here he is.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.920
Chaz, it's like December 28th.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.520
Well, you didn't nail it down.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.360
Bo, bo, bo.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.880
Did you say bo, bo, bo?

18:31.840 --> 18:32.800
Hey, everybody.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.960
Happy Valentine's Day.

18:34.960 --> 18:38.640
Okay, it's March and you said valentines.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.880
I'm the good Friday rabbit.

18:40.880 --> 18:45.280
What are you saying?

18:45.280 --> 18:49.360
I already have a semi-Santa length beard starting.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.160
How should I prep myself this year?

18:52.160 --> 18:54.400
I had already showed up around my local region

18:54.400 --> 18:56.960
to random family's Christmas parties earlier years.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.440
That's breaking and entering.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.400
Many of them already have me, Santa Claus,

19:02.400 --> 19:03.440
in their plans this year.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.920
Should I in any way change my appearance

19:05.920 --> 19:08.320
to enhance a Santa Claus look?

19:08.320 --> 19:09.120
I want to-

19:09.120 --> 19:12.000
By their plans, does he mean like their defense strategy?

19:12.640 --> 19:14.560
We have to keep Chaz Santa out.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.360
I want to keep in vogue with any styles,

19:17.360 --> 19:19.680
fashions that may change my accepted appearance.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.560
P.S. Donner has not been very good this year.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.640
I might have to place him behind Blitzen again.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.800
Those two have been up to something.

19:26.800 --> 19:27.600
Oopsie daisy.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.080
You just took a very strange turn, my friend.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.280
Oh no, you just like pivoted the sleigh.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.360
Yeah, the sleigh went somewhere else.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.320
Okay, wait.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.960
First, step one.

19:38.960 --> 19:39.280
Yeah.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.160
Ton of crunches.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.280
Just, you're gonna do so many Santa crunches.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.560
We have already done sexy Santa.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.000
We can't talk about sexy ripped Santa.

19:46.000 --> 19:46.960
Well no, this is different.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.720
This is, what Travis is suggesting is like,

19:48.720 --> 19:50.960
he still has that big bowl full of Jelly Belly,

19:50.960 --> 19:54.720
but also there's really defined abs on it.

19:54.720 --> 19:55.600
Can that happen?

19:56.960 --> 19:57.600
What?

19:57.600 --> 19:58.880
Poking through like an egg cart,

19:58.880 --> 20:01.040
like a beautiful egg cart in Santa Belly.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.160
What if you, oh, okay.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.920
You want to keep up with modern fashions, right?

20:03.920 --> 20:04.720
This is what I heard.

20:05.840 --> 20:06.880
Hipster Santa Claus.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.320
You're gonna need to wax that hair,

20:08.320 --> 20:10.480
wax that mustache, put some glitter in it,

20:10.480 --> 20:13.600
put some like ornaments hanging in your beard,

20:13.600 --> 20:16.320
and maybe, I don't know, an ironic t-shirt.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.800
Now, the good one benefit there,

20:18.800 --> 20:22.000
his skinny fanny won't have any problems getting stuck

20:22.000 --> 20:22.880
or won't get stuck.

20:22.880 --> 20:23.440
Correct.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.720
It will have problems getting stuck

20:24.720 --> 20:25.920
because it won't get stuck.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.920
So the survival rate of this Hipster Santa

20:27.920 --> 20:28.560
is definitely good,

20:28.560 --> 20:31.840
but I don't want this person approaching my children.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.440
Man, I can say stuff like that now.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.160
That's weird.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.880
I need help.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.560
I need help from Travis,

20:38.560 --> 20:39.680
and I need help from Griffin.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.280
And you at home can play along with this game, okay?

20:43.840 --> 20:45.520
As a funny joke,

20:45.520 --> 20:47.280
I just did a Google image search

20:47.280 --> 20:49.520
for cool new Santa fashions, right?

20:49.520 --> 20:50.240
Okay.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.280
What I discovered,

20:51.280 --> 20:52.400
I'm gonna send you this link,

20:52.400 --> 20:54.480
and Travis, I'll just go ahead and show you this.

20:55.040 --> 20:59.440
What I found was the same, like.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.400
Oh, wow.

21:00.400 --> 21:04.080
Hundreds of pictures of a super fashionable cool Santa.

21:04.080 --> 21:04.560
Huh.

21:04.560 --> 21:08.880
That all happen to be the same man in different...

21:09.600 --> 21:12.560
Who is this cool Santa?

21:12.560 --> 21:13.680
This is a cool Santa,

21:13.680 --> 21:14.720
and in a lot of these pictures,

21:14.720 --> 21:17.040
he's wearing a cool red leather jacket,

21:17.040 --> 21:19.040
a lot of red plaids and scarves.

21:19.760 --> 21:23.600
He's from Yorkdale, I guess, a mall in Toronto.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.120
He's like so cool.

21:27.120 --> 21:27.920
He's very fashionable.

21:27.920 --> 21:32.560
First of all, this is a definitely the Trivago guy,

21:32.560 --> 21:34.800
and there's nothing you can say to convince me otherwise.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.880
It's definitely the mysterious Trivago man.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.760
Fashion Santa is the handsomest person

21:39.760 --> 21:41.040
I've ever seen in my whole life,

21:41.040 --> 21:42.960
and everything has changed in this moment.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.040
Here's the thing.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.520
Most of what we picture of Santa Claus

21:47.520 --> 21:50.160
has been shaped by Pepsi, right?

21:50.160 --> 21:51.280
Or Coca-Cola.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.120
Those, you know, it's all that trademark.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.560
No, Pepsi for me.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.080
Pepsi, they're silly bears.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.200
I think that was also Coca-Cola.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.120
I think Pepsi stayed out of the Christmas game.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.640
They're more of an Arbor Day company.

22:04.640 --> 22:08.160
But, and so maybe it's time now that we reshape it.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.440
It's 2016.

22:09.440 --> 22:12.640
We let a new brand take over what Santa should look like.

22:12.640 --> 22:13.200
You know what I mean?

22:13.200 --> 22:16.000
Taco Bell, Taco Bell, Taco Bell.

22:16.000 --> 22:16.640
Taco Santa.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.600
Oh, I want to watch that so bad.

22:19.600 --> 22:24.080
Taco sleigh bell, he says on his magic ride across the world.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.480
How should I prep a Santa Claus?

22:26.480 --> 22:27.840
I think a fun thing you can do to like,

22:27.840 --> 22:30.640
if I was like a mall Santa, one thing I would do to prep,

22:30.640 --> 22:32.240
it wouldn't even necessarily be physical

22:32.240 --> 22:33.360
as much as it would be mental,

22:33.360 --> 22:35.600
is I would memorize the names of every child on Earth.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.520
Well, here's the thing.

22:37.520 --> 22:38.640
How sick would that be?

22:38.640 --> 22:40.240
It's like a little boy came and jumped up on my lap.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.120
I was like, what's up, Tony?

22:41.120 --> 22:42.080
And he's like, what?

22:42.080 --> 22:45.440
And I'm like, yeah, I memorized the names of every child on Earth.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.040
But see, the nice thing, Griffin,

22:47.040 --> 22:49.360
is you only have to do that really for one kid,

22:49.360 --> 22:50.560
but you could tell that kid

22:50.560 --> 22:52.800
that you memorized the names of all the kids on Earth.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.160
But like, you just have,

22:54.160 --> 22:56.160
you've learned everything about Tony.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.160
You know everything about Tony.

22:58.160 --> 23:01.840
Just to chase that, Travis, for every other child

23:02.800 --> 23:04.960
that jumps up on my lap, I'm like, hey, Tony.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.560
And they're like, no, my name is Roger.

23:06.560 --> 23:08.080
And it's like, ah, okay, get out, go away.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.240
It's not gonna work on you, is it?

23:10.240 --> 23:12.720
Get out, go, it's ruined for you now.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.560
Go ahead, it's done with you.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.400
Oh, yeah, get really good at doing

23:16.400 --> 23:19.120
like Jonathan Edwards style cold reads on people

23:19.120 --> 23:22.800
and be like, I'm getting a T, a T name, is it Tony?

23:22.800 --> 23:23.680
It's Tony?

23:23.680 --> 23:25.520
All right, now, Tony, I'm feeling you want,

23:25.520 --> 23:29.520
oh, you want something made with plastic.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.320
I'm getting plastic.

23:30.320 --> 23:31.600
It has wheels on it.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.360
No, I'm seeing someone behind you, Timmy.

23:35.360 --> 23:38.720
He's an old man, and he's got,

23:38.720 --> 23:42.080
it looks like some sort of hard candy peep-bap.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.800
Yeah, it might be a, I'm getting several P's.

23:44.800 --> 23:45.600
P letter?

23:45.600 --> 23:48.400
A lot, like three P's in one sort of name.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.440
He's got a hard candy,

23:50.320 --> 23:52.240
the little strawberries wrapped up.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.000
Yes, that's it, that's it.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.040
It is a peep-bap.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.520
Yeah, and I get he left you a bunch of money.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.600
What do you want to say to him?

23:59.600 --> 24:00.960
What do you need him to hear right now?

24:02.320 --> 24:04.480
I want a talker truck.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.880
Okay, you gotta tell peep-bap all about it.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.400
I guess your spectral peep-bap's

24:08.400 --> 24:09.600
gonna make that happen for you.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.520
You have some gross misunderstandings

24:11.520 --> 24:13.600
of how the whole Christmas process breaks down.

24:14.720 --> 24:20.240
Oh, my God, John Edwards psychic Santa is for free, everybody.

24:20.240 --> 24:21.040
That's yours.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.560
We need more Christmas specials.

24:22.560 --> 24:26.080
I realized this year that the Christmas specials for the last 10 years

24:26.080 --> 24:29.520
have been exclusively Hallmark Channel specials.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.360
I want a date, I don't want a date with Santa,

24:31.360 --> 24:32.800
my special Christmas kiss.

24:32.800 --> 24:37.040
We need more that's like Santa and John Edwards solving crimes.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.040
I mean, gang, that could just be a whole nother podcast

24:39.040 --> 24:42.880
as we just take the titles of those films that Justin just said

24:42.880 --> 24:45.360
and we put our own twisted spin on it.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.480
My, what did you say, my special Christmas kiss?

24:48.480 --> 24:50.240
That one I did invent,

24:50.240 --> 24:52.880
but that is probably not that far off.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.920
There's, I think 12 dates of Christmas is a real one.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.240
My special Christmas kiss.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.440
All right, so the pilot episode

24:59.440 --> 25:02.640
of the McElroy Brothers Christmas special hour,

25:02.640 --> 25:04.480
a holiday special hour, we'll extend it.

25:04.480 --> 25:09.120
And so let's call, does anybody have the Skype contact info

25:09.120 --> 25:10.400
for Melissa Joan Hart?

25:10.400 --> 25:14.160
Because I think we need her now more than ever.

25:14.160 --> 25:16.960
I think her and Tom Cavanaugh are in all of them.

25:16.960 --> 25:17.760
Okay, yeah.

25:17.760 --> 25:20.560
Tom and Cavanaugh, we could definitely get a line on.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.920
The man is in the game.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.280
He knows the score.

25:23.280 --> 25:23.920
He knows what we need.

25:23.920 --> 25:24.420
He is.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.800
A Christmas visitor, a Carol Christmas,

25:29.760 --> 25:31.200
a boyfriend for Christmas.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.560
A boyfriend for Christmas.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.640
Hello, that's the next one for us.

25:35.520 --> 25:38.560
The Christmas card, the grandpa for Christmas.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.080
Well, okay, now hold on.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.280
Maybe the sequel?

25:41.280 --> 25:44.080
No, no, no, you can get a boyfriend for Christmas.

25:44.080 --> 25:47.520
To get a grandpa, that's not how time works.

25:47.520 --> 25:49.760
A grandpa boyfriend for Christmas.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.920
The Christmas choir, our first Christmas.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.920
Now they're just like shooting the moon here.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.360
Dog name Christmas.

25:57.360 --> 26:01.040
Okay, so like, hi, Jeff Hallmark, president of Hallmark.

26:01.040 --> 26:02.560
I was wondering if I could pitch you a movie.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.080
Yeah, sure, how many words are in the title?

26:04.880 --> 26:05.280
Four?

26:05.280 --> 26:06.160
No, get out of here.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.040
Gotta be three.

26:07.040 --> 26:08.400
And it's gotta have Christmas in it

26:08.400 --> 26:09.680
or else people get confused.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.840
Our viewers are so dumb.

26:11.840 --> 26:12.640
They're so dumb.

26:12.640 --> 26:16.000
It has to be word Christmas word or else it's not happening.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.760
Yeah, here's some other hits.

26:19.760 --> 26:24.080
We've got the night before the night before Christmas.

26:24.080 --> 26:24.480
Oh, boy.

26:24.480 --> 26:25.040
Nice.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.160
Just kinda not great.

26:29.360 --> 26:30.400
Let's see here.

26:32.880 --> 26:36.320
Christmas in Canaan, November Christmas.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.440
Okay, come on, play it fast and loose.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.440
That's called Thanksgiving is what you've said.

26:41.440 --> 26:45.600
The town Christmas forgot an old fashioned Christmas.

26:46.320 --> 26:51.280
Okay, and then in 2011, they just like flipped the switches

26:51.280 --> 26:55.040
and pumped it into full, we're talking like three to two

26:55.040 --> 26:59.280
to three Christmas films per Hallmark production season.

26:59.280 --> 27:03.600
In 2011, they amped it up to 10 Christmas, sorry, 11.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.760
Love's Christmas journey.

27:05.760 --> 27:08.000
Lucky Christmas, cancel Christmas.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.040
A Christmas wedding tale.

27:09.040 --> 27:11.120
Cancel Christmas is actually what the executive said

27:11.120 --> 27:12.400
when all these were pitched and they're like,

27:12.400 --> 27:13.040
yeah, that's a good one.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.920
He's like, no, no, please stop the machine.

27:15.920 --> 27:19.440
No, a Christmas wish, trading Christmas,

27:19.440 --> 27:22.640
a princess for Christmas, the Christmas pageant,

27:22.640 --> 27:25.280
Christmas comes home to Canaan, Christmas magic.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.760
Now, in Hallmark's defense, 2011 was the year

27:29.760 --> 27:32.400
where Mario Lopez was cryogenically unfrozen.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.000
And he was hungry.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.080
He was hungry to do his deeds.

27:36.080 --> 27:41.280
Yeah, so this production, this company needs to get it.

27:41.280 --> 27:43.680
These people need to get it together.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.480
I do want to watch a grandpa for Christmas though.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.960
Yeah, I want to watch a grandpa and princess for Christmas.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.040
A lot of films about just human beings being kind of

27:51.840 --> 27:54.640
given a bride for Christmas.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.240
Well, no, now hold on.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.720
Tick tock.

27:58.720 --> 27:59.760
This is, get on it.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.640
This is Jeremy.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.800
He's your Jeremy for Christmas.

28:02.800 --> 28:03.680
This is your Jeremy.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.040
He's your boyfriend now.

28:05.040 --> 28:08.880
I don't want to do, I don't want to be somebody's boyfriend.

28:08.880 --> 28:09.760
Too bad, Jeremy.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.600
You're this person's boyfriend now because you're

28:11.600 --> 28:13.120
Would you rather be their grandpa?

28:13.120 --> 28:14.720
Yeah, that actually sounds better.

28:14.720 --> 28:17.040
Okay, step over into this movie, please.

28:17.040 --> 28:17.360
What's up?

28:17.360 --> 28:18.240
My name is Mystery.

28:18.240 --> 28:19.600
Welcome to Speed Seduction.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.680
So you want a bride for Christmas?

28:21.680 --> 28:23.040
You're going to have to get on it.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.080
It is mid-November.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.960
Also in the 2012 production season,

28:27.680 --> 28:29.920
the Christmas heart, come dance with me.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.480
AKA the Christmas dance.

28:32.480 --> 28:33.200
Oh, okay.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.680
Whoa, that was scary for a second.

28:35.680 --> 28:38.800
Baby's first Christmas, AKA the Christmas baby.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.080
A baby for Christmas.

28:42.080 --> 28:47.200
They're just going 2013 Pete's Christmas.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.680
The sequel to dog's Christmas.

28:51.680 --> 28:52.480
Hey, I'm Pete.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.000
This is my Christmas.

28:54.000 --> 28:54.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:54.640 --> 28:55.200
Come on in.

28:55.200 --> 28:55.600
Check it out.

28:55.600 --> 28:56.960
Let me show you where the magic happens.

28:56.960 --> 29:01.040
I've been working as a PA on these movies for a long time now.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.320
And I said, it's Pete's turn.

29:02.320 --> 29:05.280
And so they said, okay, so this is just sort of my special.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.200
Oh, holy night.

29:08.320 --> 29:10.640
Snow Bride, a very merry mix up.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.080
The Christmas ornament.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.200
Catch a Christmas star.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.640
Window Wonderland, fur crazy.

29:17.360 --> 29:18.400
Let it snow.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.760
The Christmas spirit.

29:19.760 --> 29:20.800
Santa switch.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.000
Hats off to Christmas.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.080
Hold on.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.720
When did this turn into like a Tom meets the Marys cast?

29:28.720 --> 29:30.400
That's not real.

29:30.400 --> 29:31.280
Finding Christmas.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.520
It was Christmas with Tucker.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.120
Okay, Tucker, please.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.560
Let's do another question, Tucker.

29:36.560 --> 29:37.920
We don't know.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.360
I just got to 2014.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.240
This is the best year.

29:40.240 --> 29:41.360
Everybody agrees.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.480
One star at Christmas.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.320
The nine lives of Christmas.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.240
A cookie cutter Christmas.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.360
Wait, now, hold on.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.880
They just kind of went for it in that time.

29:48.880 --> 29:51.280
Like we didn't come up with anything new for this one.

29:51.280 --> 29:52.160
We know what's up.

29:52.160 --> 29:56.320
That one was just a baby for Christmas, AKA Christmas baby.

29:56.320 --> 30:00.240
They just put a new name on it and saw if anybody would notice.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.240
The Christmas shepherd.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.360
Christmas under wraps.

30:03.360 --> 30:04.400
One Christmas Eve.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.600
Christmas at Cartwrights.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.120
Best Christmas party ever.

30:07.680 --> 30:08.720
The Christmas parade.

30:09.280 --> 30:10.560
Ice sculpture Christmas.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.440
Charming Christmas.

30:11.440 --> 30:12.560
I'm not ready for Christmas.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.480
Released in July 11th.

30:20.480 --> 30:21.760
Family for Christmas.

30:21.760 --> 30:23.360
July 11th, 2015.

30:23.360 --> 30:25.360
That was an odd programming choice.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.720
A Christmas detour.

30:26.720 --> 30:27.840
A crown for Christmas.

30:28.480 --> 30:29.680
Angel of Christmas.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.360
Just in time for Christmas.

30:31.360 --> 30:32.800
On the 12th day of Christmas.

30:32.800 --> 30:33.760
A Christmas melody.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.120
The spirit of Christmas.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.400
Christmas land.

30:37.680 --> 30:38.160
Wow.

30:38.160 --> 30:38.960
Okay.

30:38.960 --> 30:39.520
Okay.

30:39.520 --> 30:40.480
That's it.

30:40.480 --> 30:40.960
That's it.

30:40.960 --> 30:44.160
We did not make it 2016's Christmas.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.720
No, I mean, it's the last year.

30:46.720 --> 30:47.440
You should do it.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.880
A wish for Christmas.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.400
Every Christmas has a story.

30:51.120 --> 30:52.000
Clearly.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.280
Christmas cookies.

30:53.280 --> 30:54.320
My Christmas dream.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.280
Christmas cookies were getting so granular now.

31:00.080 --> 31:00.320
Yeah.

31:01.440 --> 31:02.480
Christmas panties.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.320
I'm going to read these last literally.

31:04.320 --> 31:07.280
I mean, in 2016, there was like 20 of them.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.560
I want to read these last few.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.800
But I want everybody to remember that when I read,

31:11.760 --> 31:14.960
in the one second it takes me to read one of these names,

31:14.960 --> 31:19.760
it is representative of a full feature length film

31:20.400 --> 31:23.040
that people made with their hearts and hands.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.440
Minimum 30-day shooting schedule.

31:25.440 --> 31:28.240
Probably $3 million budget.

31:28.240 --> 31:29.840
Like every single one.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.520
Hollywood hotshot Travis McElroy.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.640
Broadcasting Christmas.

31:34.640 --> 31:35.680
A December bride.

31:35.680 --> 31:38.480
Kind of non-secular take there.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.160
Christmas in Homestead.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.120
Christmas list.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.240
A heavenly Christmas.

31:42.880 --> 31:44.560
Journey back to Christmas.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.520
We have to go back.

31:47.840 --> 31:48.960
A dream of Christmas.

31:49.520 --> 31:50.480
Looks like Christmas.

31:51.520 --> 31:52.640
Wait, it's just cult.

31:52.640 --> 31:53.520
Looks like Christmas.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.480
Looks like Christmas.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.320
A Nutcracker Christmas.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.600
Love you like Christmas.

31:57.600 --> 31:58.480
Okay, wait.

31:58.480 --> 31:58.800
Whoa.

31:59.760 --> 32:03.200
And My Christmas Loves Sleigh Bells Ring

32:03.200 --> 32:05.920
and When Calls the Heart Christmas,

32:05.920 --> 32:08.480
which was just released literally yesterday.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.480
When Calls the Heart Christmas?

32:10.480 --> 32:12.160
When Calls the Heart Christmas.

32:13.360 --> 32:13.680
Okay.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.760
Hey, we forgot a word in this tie-dub.

32:15.760 --> 32:16.560
Does that matter?

32:16.560 --> 32:16.880
Nah.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.440
How about another question?

32:21.440 --> 32:23.280
Cause we've done one.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.720
Uh, yeah.

32:24.720 --> 32:25.600
A few years ago,

32:25.600 --> 32:28.160
I was celebrating Candle Nights with my in-laws

32:28.160 --> 32:30.080
and it was time to open up our stockings.

32:30.080 --> 32:32.160
So we were all chanting stocking,

32:32.160 --> 32:34.480
stocking, stocking,

32:34.480 --> 32:36.720
which naturally became Star King,

32:36.720 --> 32:38.960
Star King, Star King.

32:38.960 --> 32:40.960
We decided this was to be the new Christmas Lord.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.040
Candle Nights Lord.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.240
Candle Nights Lord, right.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.320
Now, instead of Santa,

32:46.320 --> 32:48.720
we give out gifts from the Star King.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.880
The problem is I now have a son

32:50.880 --> 32:52.800
and I'm worried that he'll end up an outcast

32:52.800 --> 32:54.160
because of our tradition.

32:54.160 --> 32:55.120
For perspective,

32:55.120 --> 32:57.200
I have a friend who had a real tough time in school

32:57.200 --> 32:58.160
because her parents told her

32:58.160 --> 33:00.320
the Trash Man came on November 1,

33:00.320 --> 33:01.600
took away her Halloween candy

33:01.600 --> 33:02.800
and replaced it with a toy.

33:02.800 --> 33:06.400
The Trash Man!

33:06.400 --> 33:09.680
They couldn't come up with like a slightly more whimsical...

33:09.680 --> 33:11.840
The Candy Fairy came.

33:11.840 --> 33:13.280
The Candy Boy.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.480
I'm the Candy Boy.

33:14.480 --> 33:16.640
Come away with me, Whoppers.

33:16.640 --> 33:17.840
You're mine now.

33:17.840 --> 33:20.000
I'm going to suckle you on my way home.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.440
Here's an action toy.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.840
No, instead it's,

33:23.840 --> 33:26.000
hey, I'm out for the candy.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.400
Hey, man, you gotta put the candy out by the curb.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.600
I'm not gonna walk back.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.040
I'm gonna walk in your room.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.480
I'm not gonna walk back there and grab it.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.560
You gonna give it to Hungry Child of the World?

33:34.560 --> 33:36.480
No, I'm gonna throw it in the trash.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.160
No, man, it goes right into the comeback here.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.520
It's gonna go in the trash.

33:39.520 --> 33:42.080
But where does it go?

33:42.080 --> 33:43.600
Where does any of the trash go?

33:44.160 --> 33:45.280
Into the river.

33:45.280 --> 33:48.080
All your Twizzlers gonna end up in the river

33:48.080 --> 33:49.840
because that's where the trash may not.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.200
For the fishes.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.000
For the fishes.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.120
Here's a Polly Pocket.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.920
And a Mad Max toy for you.

33:57.920 --> 34:01.280
I took this away from another kid at the end of last Christmas season.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.840
It's a real cyclical gig I got.

34:03.840 --> 34:06.960
You should know somebody done threw away this Polly Pocket.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.120
It's a circle of life.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.040
I'm gonna throw it in the trash.

34:13.040 --> 34:15.040
I'm gonna throw it in the trash.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.720
Uh, am I good?

34:17.600 --> 34:20.480
Or should I try to give my son a more mainstream candlelight?

34:21.440 --> 34:23.440
That's from Star King's Humble Servant.

34:23.440 --> 34:26.800
I mean, you've already adopted our weird holiday.

34:26.800 --> 34:32.800
So like, your kid's gonna be unconventional with his holiday tradition.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.000
But the good news is this.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.720
In this modern age, the problem with the Halloween thing is

34:38.720 --> 34:40.560
everybody knows what Halloween is.

34:40.560 --> 34:43.440
So you can't just introduce like the trash man comes

34:43.440 --> 34:45.040
and everyone's like, no, he doesn't.

34:45.040 --> 34:45.760
No, that's nothing.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.680
We also do Halloween.

34:47.680 --> 34:50.880
But when you say we like the Star Lord brings,

34:50.880 --> 34:53.840
the Star King brings presents on candlelight,

34:53.840 --> 34:56.800
any teacher is gonna go, uh, okay.

34:56.800 --> 34:57.760
What is that?

34:57.760 --> 35:00.160
They're just not going to question this stuff they don't know.

35:00.160 --> 35:02.320
There is something interesting about like,

35:02.320 --> 35:07.280
because people are usually fairly insular on Christmas day,

35:07.920 --> 35:11.280
there is a certain intimacy or like secrecy with like,

35:11.280 --> 35:13.360
what is your, like, that's a common question.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.440
Like, so what is your, what do you guys do?

35:15.440 --> 35:19.440
Because it's like, so it's not like, it hasn't been sort of,

35:20.240 --> 35:24.560
the edges of it have not been sanded off through like socialization.

35:24.560 --> 35:28.080
Like everybody's just doing whatever weird thing they've always done for Christmas.

35:28.080 --> 35:32.000
But there is, there is a, there's a limit to that though, Juicer,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.320
because it can't, what do you do on Christmas?

35:34.320 --> 35:37.200
Well, my family, we open our stuff on Christmas Eve and it's really great.

35:37.200 --> 35:37.760
What do you do?

35:37.760 --> 35:41.360
Well, the Star King descends from the cosmos.

35:41.360 --> 35:42.960
Here's what you gotta do, Griffin.

35:42.960 --> 35:47.200
You need to give Star King a leg up over Santa.

35:47.200 --> 35:50.880
So when your, your kid is talking to other kids and your kid's like,

35:50.880 --> 35:53.600
yeah, Star King comes like, Star King doesn't come,

35:53.600 --> 35:54.880
Santa comes and brings presents.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.120
And he's like, oh, Star King comes and brings presents

35:57.120 --> 35:58.880
and gives me a hundred dollar bill every year.

35:58.880 --> 36:02.480
And the kid's like, oh, dang, I love Star King.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.840
Star King sounds way better.

36:03.840 --> 36:06.480
Also every year the Star King kills and eats Santa Claus

36:06.480 --> 36:08.000
and there has to be a new Santa Claus each year.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.600
Have you seen the Santa Claus movie?

36:09.600 --> 36:11.200
Do you not remember at the end of the first one

36:11.200 --> 36:13.840
when Tim Allen is killed and devoured by the Star King?

36:13.840 --> 36:16.960
They have to do, Santa, Santa and the Star King have to do battle

36:16.960 --> 36:22.000
every single Christmas Eve and our fate is decided by, by their struggle.

36:22.880 --> 36:23.840
Star King always wins.

36:23.840 --> 36:24.640
He's the king of the stars.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.320
What do you want me to, what do you want me to say?

36:26.320 --> 36:27.040
What do you want?

36:27.040 --> 36:27.360
I don't know.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.080
I don't know what to tell you.

36:28.080 --> 36:31.280
I feel like we're at a crossroads right now, Boyos,

36:32.480 --> 36:33.840
because this, we're having a lot of fun here,

36:33.840 --> 36:38.000
but I do not want to send this, this, the small child into school

36:38.000 --> 36:40.560
armed with our, our japes.

36:41.520 --> 36:42.720
I do not want him going around and be like,

36:42.720 --> 36:44.080
so what'd you guys get from the Star King?

36:44.080 --> 36:45.520
Oh, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch.

36:45.520 --> 36:48.160
Um, what is, hmm.

36:48.880 --> 36:49.680
You gotta cloak it.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.920
Yeah, that's what, that's what, that's the crossroads.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.920
Is candlelight's going to become the next big thing

36:53.920 --> 36:56.960
or is it a super dope secret holiday society?

36:56.960 --> 36:58.080
This is the decision point.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.240
We are standing at it now because if it's the next big thing,

37:00.240 --> 37:03.120
we need to get out the good word of Star King right now.

37:03.120 --> 37:06.960
If not, then wait, we didn't come up with Star King.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.880
No, but he's canonical, definitely.

37:08.880 --> 37:09.920
I'm on board.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.200
Yeah, I'm on board.

37:11.200 --> 37:12.960
So the Star King is canonical.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.720
Yes, but I don't want to make him the main focus.

37:14.720 --> 37:15.440
He is in there.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.200
He's in the mix, you know what I mean?

37:17.200 --> 37:17.760
No kings.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.000
No kings on the man.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.200
Except for the Star King, um, who is the king of stars.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.880
But I, I, here, okay.

37:24.880 --> 37:27.600
Maybe tell your son, tell your child,

37:27.600 --> 37:30.480
like the Star King comes for you.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.080
Everyone else has been bad.

37:32.080 --> 37:35.840
And like, no one else in your school

37:35.840 --> 37:38.080
has deserved the love of the Star King.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.760
And so like, you can't tell them

37:39.760 --> 37:42.160
or you will be shunned because you are the chosen.

37:42.160 --> 37:43.760
Santa Claus is for second rate kids.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.680
Star King is for closers.

37:46.720 --> 37:51.200
Star King is the one that comes for the real good kids.

37:51.200 --> 37:54.000
You've reached our platinum level status, child.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.280
Santa Claus is a participation medal

37:57.280 --> 38:00.240
and you are getting the Oscar for best kid.

38:00.240 --> 38:03.520
Star King only comes to one kid a year and it's you.

38:03.520 --> 38:06.240
But you can't tell the others or you'll be purged.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.600
I had to pay a lot of money for this.

38:08.560 --> 38:09.760
Don't go running your mouth about it.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.760
I don't want your friends to think we're Gigi.

38:11.760 --> 38:14.080
A lot of star money printed,

38:14.080 --> 38:18.880
printed from the plasma of, of those hot, hot babies.

38:21.520 --> 38:22.560
Do you guys want a yahoo?

38:23.280 --> 38:23.920
Uh, yeah.

38:23.920 --> 38:24.400
Yeah, I do.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.560
This one was sent in by level 9,000 Yajur Jujujampur.

38:26.560 --> 38:26.960
Thank you, Drew.

38:26.960 --> 38:28.320
It's Yajur answer's user.

38:28.320 --> 38:29.200
They are anonymous.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.120
It's the Star King asks,

38:32.880 --> 38:36.480
why does Santa Claus spelled with an E,

38:36.480 --> 38:39.120
that movie has just poisoned this thing, huh?

38:39.120 --> 38:40.320
Yeah, it's miserable.

38:40.880 --> 38:45.280
Why does Santa Claus allow Rudolph to get bullied by the other reindeer?

38:45.280 --> 38:48.080
Santa has a duty to keep all his reindeer safe.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.840
Let's talk, let's talk about, oh, okay.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.160
Well, I, okay.

38:54.160 --> 38:54.880
Here's what that meant.

38:54.880 --> 38:59.440
Cause I just rewatched this and I realized the misconception is that

38:59.440 --> 39:01.520
there are only eight reindeer and Rudolph.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.720
Santa only wants the best.

39:04.720 --> 39:07.840
There's a whole thing about them trying out and he's like,

39:07.840 --> 39:09.360
maybe you'll be good enough.

39:09.360 --> 39:12.800
Santa is very withholding of his love to all the reindeers.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.600
This holiday special is taking a fun Ayn Rand turn.

39:15.600 --> 39:18.320
It's true though, because they're all out there competing.

39:18.320 --> 39:21.120
There's a coach who's judging their performance.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.200
And if, maybe if they're good enough,

39:23.200 --> 39:24.880
they'll make it up to the big show.

39:24.880 --> 39:26.160
No, they don't though.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.560
This is what kills me about the Rudolph show.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.800
They're all training these like new reindeer.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.280
And they're like, I hope I make it on Santa's team.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.000
You won't.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.280
Santa has eight and he always has those same eight.

39:39.280 --> 39:42.640
And your dad, by the way, Rudolph knows this.

39:42.640 --> 39:42.880
Yeah.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.640
This is not new information to him.

39:44.640 --> 39:48.960
Every year, a crop of young comers tries to make a run at the throne

39:48.960 --> 39:51.760
and they get beat back down by the original eight

39:51.760 --> 39:53.600
as it always shall be.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.280
Now, once Rudolph gets his place on there

39:55.280 --> 39:57.040
and kind of upsets the symmetry a little bit,

39:57.760 --> 39:59.200
he's on there for good.

39:59.200 --> 40:02.960
But why are we putting lies in the heads of these little reindeer?

40:02.960 --> 40:04.480
They're like, I'm going to make the squat.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.120
You're not.

40:05.120 --> 40:05.680
You're not.

40:05.680 --> 40:06.160
You're not.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.920
It's the eight guys.

40:07.920 --> 40:10.400
You need five years of experience just to be considered.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.960
But how do I get the experience?

40:12.960 --> 40:17.040
Let's set aside that cruel arithmetic though and talk about,

40:17.040 --> 40:21.200
there is a part where Rudolph gets a smooch-a-roo

40:21.200 --> 40:24.000
and he's flying through the sky, flying beautifully.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.920
Most beautiful flight you've ever seen.

40:25.920 --> 40:27.920
And Santa's like, oh, sick.

40:27.920 --> 40:29.360
And then he lands.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.080
Super tight, bro.

40:30.080 --> 40:30.640
He's like, sick.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.960
That was some dope Air Force stuff.

40:32.960 --> 40:33.760
I'm losing my mind.

40:33.760 --> 40:34.480
That was so great.

40:34.480 --> 40:34.960
Way to go.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.200
You're like a blue angel.

40:37.200 --> 40:37.920
Yeah.

40:37.920 --> 40:40.400
And then he lands and his dumb nose cap falls off

40:40.400 --> 40:42.080
and he's got that red nose.

40:42.080 --> 40:44.240
And then Santa Claus is like, ooh.

40:44.240 --> 40:48.960
Santa Claus is like, your face is all, what's with your jacked up face?

40:48.960 --> 40:49.760
No way.

40:49.760 --> 40:50.080
Get up.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.280
What's with your ugly nose?

40:51.280 --> 40:52.800
Get out of here, ugly nose.

40:52.800 --> 40:55.200
You fly super good, but you've got a weird ugly nose

40:55.200 --> 40:57.200
and I just can't hang with that.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.360
But why are we surprised by this, Griffin?

40:59.360 --> 41:01.520
Because the whole Santa Claus thing is like,

41:01.520 --> 41:02.640
you got to earn his love.

41:03.600 --> 41:07.360
Santa Claus is not the most forgiving.

41:07.360 --> 41:10.000
He's not like, I love you even when you do bad stuff.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.400
If you do bad stuff, you're off the list.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.960
I watched the special Twas the Night Before Christmas

41:14.960 --> 41:17.280
with the mice and the clock and the singing.

41:17.280 --> 41:20.320
And this one kid writes a letter like,

41:20.320 --> 41:21.440
we don't believe in Santa Claus.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.040
And Santa Claus is like, all right.

41:23.040 --> 41:25.360
Well, your town's dead to me now.

41:25.360 --> 41:28.320
And returns all of their letters marked like,

41:28.320 --> 41:32.800
returned from recipient, addressee, returned.

41:32.800 --> 41:35.440
And everyone in town is like, oh, cool.

41:35.440 --> 41:39.120
Well, I guess we burned Santa and he burned us right back.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.040
And all of those people are out.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.040
You only get one with Santa.

41:43.040 --> 41:45.040
Santa does not forgive and forget.

41:45.040 --> 41:47.360
And that's the good thing about Stark King.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.600
He's only going to visit one child.

41:50.320 --> 41:53.280
But that's an unwavering love.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.280
Yeah, that's true.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.520
Once you're in with Stark King, you're in.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.280
Well, man, canonize rules.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.480
Christmas is over.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.400
Yeah, Christmas is yesterday.

42:03.280 --> 42:05.360
Stark King wouldn't play favorites with reindeer.

42:05.360 --> 42:05.840
I know.

42:05.840 --> 42:06.400
I feel like this-

42:06.400 --> 42:07.680
He would kill all of them.

42:07.680 --> 42:10.240
I feel like this has been a very Christmas heavy

42:10.960 --> 42:12.720
holiday special.

42:12.720 --> 42:16.400
But I really just think it is just a really thorough

42:16.960 --> 42:20.320
evaluation of this being called Christmas.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.680
And I think we got to put it to,

42:23.680 --> 42:24.480
I think we put it,

42:24.480 --> 42:27.520
I think it's time to put it to bed and let the Stark King rain.

42:28.160 --> 42:30.160
We actually, when we were filming the show,

42:30.160 --> 42:32.480
we got to hang out with some pagans and talk to them

42:32.480 --> 42:33.920
because we were looking for like,

42:33.920 --> 42:36.160
other holidays to incorporate into canonize.

42:36.160 --> 42:38.800
Not just like, you know, the super mainstream ones.

42:38.800 --> 42:41.040
And we learned all about Yule and stuff.

42:41.040 --> 42:45.440
And like what you do at Yule is you talk about awesome stuff

42:45.440 --> 42:49.440
and you eat a bunch of food and you dance and you drink

42:49.440 --> 42:51.680
and you just hang out and you have a good time.

42:52.320 --> 42:56.960
And somehow that got knocked out for Christmas.

42:57.760 --> 42:59.200
That's horse apples.

43:00.240 --> 43:02.960
I want to reincorporate more of Yule into Candle Nights.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.600
I want Yule Brenner to be Santa.

43:05.600 --> 43:06.640
Kind of a cool, bold-

43:06.640 --> 43:07.840
No, Santa's out.

43:07.840 --> 43:08.480
Santa's out.

43:08.480 --> 43:09.120
Stark King.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.240
No, okay, hold on.

43:10.240 --> 43:14.160
Wait, we should, I don't want to be exclusive.

43:14.160 --> 43:16.960
I don't want to actually wage a war on Christmas.

43:16.960 --> 43:20.480
Santa can stay, but only sexy Toronto fashion Santa.

43:20.480 --> 43:21.920
He's the only one now.

43:21.920 --> 43:25.280
And if you want presents, you need to get to Toronto.

43:25.280 --> 43:26.080
That's what's up.

43:26.080 --> 43:28.000
I would like Stark King to be Yule Brenner,

43:28.000 --> 43:31.600
but Yule Brenner from Cool Runnings.

43:32.320 --> 43:32.480
No.

43:32.480 --> 43:34.400
Yule Brenner was not in Cool Runnings.

43:34.400 --> 43:36.400
The name of the character is Yule Brenner.

43:36.400 --> 43:37.280
Get bent.

43:37.280 --> 43:38.480
I'm not making that up.

43:38.480 --> 43:40.560
No, it's true.

43:40.560 --> 43:43.440
I mean, if it's going to be the Stark King,

43:43.440 --> 43:47.360
then we're talking about, wait, was he in Blade Runner?

43:47.360 --> 43:48.240
I don't know anything.

43:49.360 --> 43:50.400
Yule Brenner?

43:50.400 --> 43:52.400
I don't, I just don't know anything about anything.

43:52.960 --> 44:00.320
Yeah, fashion Santa is the only Santa that we recognize here

44:00.320 --> 44:01.920
at, in Candle Nights.

44:01.920 --> 44:03.520
And I think he's sort of like a,

44:04.560 --> 44:05.920
he doesn't have a position of authority.

44:05.920 --> 44:07.360
He feels like a number two.

44:07.360 --> 44:08.320
Like an emissary.

44:08.320 --> 44:09.120
I would say emissary.

44:09.120 --> 44:12.000
He can't make the decisions, but he can definitely hand them down.

44:12.000 --> 44:17.120
Like if Stark King is like the Michael Eisner CEO,

44:17.840 --> 44:21.280
Fashion Santa is like the Frank Wells president,

44:21.280 --> 44:22.320
sort of the person that makes the train.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.160
A reference everyone can understand.

44:24.160 --> 44:27.280
Not just Justin, who's been reading a book about the inner workings at Disney.

44:27.280 --> 44:29.280
So the person that makes the trains run, you know?

44:29.280 --> 44:31.040
That's, that's Fashion Santa.

44:31.040 --> 44:34.800
Fashion Santa is the up eye works to Stark King's Walt Disney.

44:34.800 --> 44:39.440
Do you guys think Yule Brenner and Rutger Hauer

44:39.440 --> 44:42.320
do like all kinds of like fun parent traps,

44:42.320 --> 44:44.880
sort of like switcheroos where they just switch lives

44:44.880 --> 44:46.960
and everybody's like, Rutger?

44:46.960 --> 44:48.480
And Yule's like, yes.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.440
And they're like, oh, okay.

44:55.280 --> 44:57.200
Your names, your names, your name.

44:57.200 --> 44:58.480
Hey, you've got a weird name, right?

44:58.480 --> 44:59.520
Yes, I do.

44:59.520 --> 45:00.560
That one's not even a lie.

45:00.560 --> 45:03.440
I was going to ask, it's not that they look alike,

45:03.440 --> 45:06.080
it's that their names are confusingly weird to you.

45:07.440 --> 45:07.760
Listen.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.560
And also it's another fun,

45:11.200 --> 45:13.840
another fun fact is one is dead and one is alive.

45:16.640 --> 45:18.160
But you'll never guess which.

45:18.160 --> 45:20.640
Now that makes things easier on the living one

45:20.640 --> 45:22.080
because he's sort of a day walker.

45:22.080 --> 45:24.720
Now he can switch between roles and it's not even a big thing.

45:26.720 --> 45:30.080
So we, are we done?

45:30.080 --> 45:33.840
I think, I think we're getting, I think we're getting pretty close.

45:33.840 --> 45:36.320
I don't, I don't have any more good yahoos

45:36.320 --> 45:40.240
unless we have like another tight question to bounce into real quick.

45:40.240 --> 45:42.640
Trav, is there any that you would especially like to...

45:42.640 --> 45:43.360
Yes, I do.

45:43.360 --> 45:47.200
Can I read it so I don't have to communicate it across the table to you?

45:47.200 --> 45:47.680
Yeah.

45:47.680 --> 45:50.720
I bought some presents for my friend's kids this candlelight.

45:50.720 --> 45:52.240
Her younger one is nine months old

45:52.240 --> 45:54.880
and I found these awesome stuffed dragons that make noise.

45:54.880 --> 45:58.080
The only problem, they're technically dog toys.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.360
This again, this again.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.040
This again, this again, huh?

46:02.160 --> 46:05.680
I already gave them to her but didn't mention the dog toy part.

46:05.680 --> 46:08.240
Honestly, I think the more annoying toy is the foam lightsaber

46:08.240 --> 46:09.200
I got her eight-year-old.

46:09.760 --> 46:10.560
Am I good?

46:10.560 --> 46:11.760
That's from Guilty Gifter.

46:12.640 --> 46:15.520
Is 2017 just gonna be the year where we all realize

46:15.520 --> 46:17.120
that the things that are good for humans

46:17.120 --> 46:19.600
are also things that are good for dogs and vice versa

46:19.600 --> 46:23.600
and we are just like an island of Dr. Moreau style just finally merged.

46:23.600 --> 46:25.920
The flesh becomes fur, the fur becomes flesh

46:25.920 --> 46:29.360
and we all just start yiffing each other's brains out 2017.

46:29.360 --> 46:31.840
Welcome to the yiffing year.

46:31.840 --> 46:33.040
It's time to begin.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.240
I think it is hysterical

46:36.240 --> 46:39.520
if you think about humans are supposed to be the more advanced species.

46:39.520 --> 46:44.560
Dogs do not make this distinction, have not, will not, ever.

46:45.200 --> 46:47.120
You give them something for them and they're like,

46:47.120 --> 46:48.480
hmm, cool, something for me.

46:48.480 --> 46:49.920
Here's other things for me.

46:49.920 --> 46:52.560
Everything in your home is a dog thing.

46:52.560 --> 46:54.640
They're not drawing those lines.

46:54.640 --> 46:57.360
No, and I've seen my dog attempt to eat stuff

46:57.360 --> 46:59.680
that will quite literally kill her.

47:00.240 --> 47:02.080
And like you would think that the animal,

47:02.080 --> 47:05.120
like I can look at poison and be like, hmm, no, no.

47:05.120 --> 47:06.640
No arsenic for me, thank you.

47:06.640 --> 47:09.680
But my dog sees grapes and she's like, well, why the heck not?

47:09.680 --> 47:11.680
No, well, I do wanna say, Travis,

47:11.680 --> 47:14.160
the reverse of that would be you see Beggar's strips

47:14.160 --> 47:17.040
and you think, hmm, for me, that would actually kill you.

47:18.160 --> 47:19.200
That would definitely kill you.

47:19.200 --> 47:19.760
Those are made out of-

47:19.760 --> 47:20.880
I don't think, wait, hold on, girl.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.800
I don't think Beggar's strips would kill me.

47:22.800 --> 47:26.560
Yeah, they're made out of red, smoky human poison.

47:26.560 --> 47:27.440
They are not good.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.120
They're not good for Trav tummy.

47:29.120 --> 47:30.000
Travis, it's important.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.760
This is now a PSA for you, my boy.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.520
Don't eat a Beggar's strip, my boy.

47:33.520 --> 47:34.720
I would never eat a Beggar's strip.

47:34.720 --> 47:37.120
Don't eat one of those poppin' things

47:37.120 --> 47:39.200
that shoot out of the little rubber pig nose thing

47:39.200 --> 47:41.760
that looks like a lot of fun to catch Cheetos in.

47:41.760 --> 47:43.680
But if it's one of the meatballs, then you'll die.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.400
There are actually a lot of snacks.

47:46.400 --> 47:49.200
Now that I've owned a dog with a slightly sensitive tummy,

47:49.200 --> 47:51.040
there are many dog snacks made for dogs

47:51.040 --> 47:52.880
that everybody just kind of accepts.

47:52.880 --> 47:54.480
Like, yeah, give this to your dog.

47:54.480 --> 47:56.720
They're definitely gonna puke it up.

47:57.440 --> 47:58.960
But like, what are you gonna do?

47:58.960 --> 48:00.400
It's like, wait, hold on.

48:00.400 --> 48:04.320
Have we all just accepted that 50% of dog treats are like,

48:04.320 --> 48:07.280
oh no, you give your dog this Pavaroni,

48:07.280 --> 48:09.360
you are going to diarrhea station.

48:09.360 --> 48:10.800
Have fun, your dog loves it.

48:13.840 --> 48:16.000
I think you can give the child these,

48:16.000 --> 48:17.200
and I don't think it's a thing.

48:17.920 --> 48:18.640
Obviously.

48:18.640 --> 48:19.120
Unless it-

48:19.120 --> 48:21.040
A tennis ball is a toy for everyone.

48:21.040 --> 48:22.240
A tennis ball is a toy for everyone.

48:22.240 --> 48:24.080
Unless.

48:24.960 --> 48:25.520
Unless.

48:26.400 --> 48:27.120
That sound.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.360
That sound that the dragons make.

48:29.360 --> 48:30.480
They make noise.

48:30.480 --> 48:32.960
Is that noise, squeaking?

48:33.600 --> 48:35.920
Because that's a dog toy.

48:35.920 --> 48:36.960
That's for dogs.

48:36.960 --> 48:40.080
Or is it like, thank you for biting me, Gerald, the dog.

48:40.960 --> 48:42.800
Now let me read you a story.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.320
Well, I don't know why that dog would get anything out of that.

48:46.320 --> 48:49.200
I don't know, it's like for the kid.

48:49.200 --> 48:51.040
You know, like that's what kids toys do.

48:51.040 --> 48:52.320
They read them stories.

48:52.320 --> 48:53.520
This is an excellent point, Gerald,

48:53.520 --> 48:55.440
because if that kid like grows up

48:55.440 --> 48:56.880
and that becomes their favorite toy,

48:56.880 --> 48:58.800
like you can't get that toy away from that kid,

48:58.800 --> 49:00.000
and they're like three years old

49:00.000 --> 49:03.120
and they take their favorite dragon to like the park,

49:03.120 --> 49:04.800
to the playground and they squeeze that

49:04.800 --> 49:08.640
and every single parent at the park goes, it's a dog toy.

49:08.640 --> 49:10.400
That is a dog, that's a toy for dogs.

49:10.960 --> 49:11.840
It's a dog toy.

49:11.840 --> 49:12.400
Do you know that?

49:12.400 --> 49:13.440
You know that, right?

49:13.440 --> 49:14.880
Like, do you know that's a dog toy?

49:14.880 --> 49:15.760
Okay.

49:15.760 --> 49:18.240
I say whatever makes your little one happy,

49:19.040 --> 49:20.000
it's not your little one.

49:20.560 --> 49:21.520
Oh, shoot.

49:22.160 --> 49:24.080
Teddy Ruxpin is back, by the way.

49:24.080 --> 49:26.000
Speaking of toys that tell stories,

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Teddy Ruxpin's gonna be the hot toy in 2017.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.280
I'm calling it right now.

49:29.280 --> 49:30.800
Is it a fashion Teddy Ruxpin?

49:30.800 --> 49:31.520
No, it's regular.

49:31.520 --> 49:32.480
Well, I mean, he looks good.

49:32.480 --> 49:34.320
He looks good.

49:34.320 --> 49:35.200
He's kept in shape.

49:35.200 --> 49:37.200
He's kept, he's taking care of himself.

49:37.200 --> 49:39.440
I'm calling it right now just so you can get out in front of it.

49:39.440 --> 49:42.080
It's gonna be the hot toy of 2017.

49:42.080 --> 49:42.880
Okay.

49:42.880 --> 49:44.880
Coming in, like, the summer, I think.

49:44.880 --> 49:46.240
So, buy deep and buy hard.

49:46.800 --> 49:47.360
Teddy Ruxpin's back.

49:47.360 --> 49:47.680
Gross.

49:48.720 --> 49:54.240
It was, and I'm so glad that everybody got out to see Trolls this year.

49:54.240 --> 49:56.560
I'm so glad that, I saw all my friends at the theater,

49:56.560 --> 49:58.880
and I was like, you're seeing Trolls today too?

49:58.880 --> 50:01.920
And I was like, yeah, wouldn't miss it.

50:01.920 --> 50:02.320
And so we-

50:02.320 --> 50:04.880
Wait, did you go see Trolls?

50:04.880 --> 50:05.840
Trolls, baby.

50:07.520 --> 50:08.480
It's pretty good.

50:08.480 --> 50:10.000
I know, I've heard it's very good.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.160
I'm never gonna go see another movie again.

50:12.160 --> 50:13.120
Unfortunately.

50:14.320 --> 50:15.920
Had plans to see Rogue One.

50:15.920 --> 50:17.840
It was gonna be my one little sneak away mission,

50:17.840 --> 50:20.720
my one little Metal Gear Solid Snake sneak away mission

50:20.720 --> 50:23.520
away from the home just to see Rogue One real quick

50:23.520 --> 50:25.040
and then back forever.

50:25.040 --> 50:27.600
But everybody in the house got diarrhea all at the same time.

50:27.600 --> 50:29.760
So sorry, sorry, George Lucas.

50:29.760 --> 50:32.880
I'm gonna have to see your wonderful fable at a later date.

50:34.400 --> 50:35.120
Sorry, George Lucas.

50:35.120 --> 50:37.360
Gonna have to hear about the Death Star and Darth Vader

50:37.360 --> 50:40.560
and all his fun adventures on a later date.

50:40.560 --> 50:42.160
Maybe I'll catch it direct to DVD.

50:42.160 --> 50:43.920
Thank you, George, but no.

50:43.920 --> 50:45.600
More like Darth Later.

50:45.600 --> 50:47.840
Darth Later, sorry, the Death Star hit everyone

50:47.840 --> 50:50.640
in my house's tummies and gave all three of us diarrhea.

50:50.640 --> 50:52.240
And their diarrhea beam.

50:52.240 --> 50:54.320
We got hit by the diarrhea beam from the Death Star

50:54.320 --> 50:55.840
and the baby's very small,

50:55.840 --> 50:57.920
but maybe just as much, if not more diarrhea than me.

50:57.920 --> 50:59.200
And I'm not sure how that's possible.

50:59.200 --> 51:01.760
Great, thank you, George Lucas, but tomorrow.

51:03.440 --> 51:05.120
And I forget what I was talking about.

51:05.120 --> 51:06.560
Please don't spoil Rogue One for me.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.280
Please, just don't spoil Rogue One, okay?

51:09.280 --> 51:12.640
Okay, that's gonna do it for us.

51:13.760 --> 51:15.520
I wanna say this is a fun thing.

51:17.520 --> 51:19.040
We are, there's gonna be a little,

51:20.080 --> 51:23.600
a little holiday sneak peek, and I do mean very little,

51:24.240 --> 51:25.760
but a little teaser.

51:25.760 --> 51:27.840
A little teaser of our TV show.

51:27.840 --> 51:29.600
It's going to be, it's not gonna be,

51:30.480 --> 51:32.560
I wanna temper it, because it's.

51:32.560 --> 51:35.120
I wanna temper it, but it's funny.

51:35.120 --> 51:37.600
There's just a little bit of foot, here's the first,

51:37.600 --> 51:41.920
the first released footage from our television program

51:41.920 --> 51:43.040
will appear today.

51:44.640 --> 51:47.200
There will be a beefier boy coming out soon

51:47.200 --> 51:48.240
with more stuff in it.

51:48.240 --> 51:49.680
This is just an amused beach.

51:49.680 --> 51:50.720
I don't want you to get excited,

51:50.720 --> 51:51.920
but it's just a dumb ol' thing.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.360
You can find it on Twitter,

51:54.640 --> 51:59.360
or Twitter.com slash CISO TV,

51:59.360 --> 52:03.200
or Twitter.com slash MBAM.

52:03.200 --> 52:07.120
We will be putting it there, as well.

52:07.120 --> 52:08.960
So, it'll be up this afternoon.

52:08.960 --> 52:09.920
It's just a little thing.

52:09.920 --> 52:12.320
It's like a really, it's a really little thing.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.720
It's just fun and flirty and a little thing.

52:14.720 --> 52:16.080
It's not any big deal.

52:17.200 --> 52:19.840
We need to convene at some point, boys,

52:19.840 --> 52:21.520
and decide, because this is our last episode

52:21.520 --> 52:24.480
of this rotten garbage year,

52:24.480 --> 52:26.240
and I think we need to get together

52:26.240 --> 52:28.240
and really figure out how we can help

52:28.240 --> 52:29.760
the 2017 effort,

52:29.760 --> 52:32.800
because they're gonna need us now more than ever,

52:32.800 --> 52:34.640
and we need a good name for it.

52:34.640 --> 52:37.520
2017, I'm leaning towards just like,

52:37.520 --> 52:38.960
but it also has the connotations of,

52:38.960 --> 52:40.560
you know, we're all gonna die,

52:40.560 --> 52:42.720
and I'm not so obsessed about that.

52:42.720 --> 52:44.560
20-given-teen, is that too much of a stretch?

52:44.560 --> 52:45.280
That's not, yeah.

52:45.280 --> 52:47.440
2011-teen, just get into bread.

52:47.440 --> 52:48.800
Or into Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

52:49.600 --> 52:50.560
2011-teen.

52:51.280 --> 52:52.880
2011-teen is good.

52:52.880 --> 52:53.920
Just kind of, Joseph.

52:54.480 --> 52:56.000
Anyway, we'll figure it out.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.200
We'll piece it together.

52:57.200 --> 52:57.680
We won't.

52:57.680 --> 52:59.040
We'll forget, and then we'll have to do it

52:59.040 --> 52:59.840
in the middle of the next episode.

52:59.840 --> 53:04.960
Brevet-teen, where we all learn about, like, wit.

53:04.960 --> 53:08.480
Okay, that is actually the end of the program, right?

53:08.480 --> 53:08.720
Yeah.

53:09.280 --> 53:10.080
It is, right?

53:11.280 --> 53:14.000
We wanna say thank you to John Rogers and the Lawn Winners

53:14.000 --> 53:15.440
for using their theme song.

53:15.440 --> 53:16.800
It's a departure off the album,

53:16.800 --> 53:18.160
putting the days to bed.

53:18.160 --> 53:20.080
Hope you found that in your stockings this year.

53:20.080 --> 53:22.080
I do wanna, I do.

53:22.080 --> 53:23.600
Sorry, what were you gonna say, Travis?

53:23.600 --> 53:25.680
I was gonna say, go check out all the other amazing shows

53:25.680 --> 53:26.960
on MaximumFun.org.

53:26.960 --> 53:31.760
I wanna say, it has been a pretty stinky, stinky year.

53:31.760 --> 53:33.200
Lost George Michael yesterday.

53:33.200 --> 53:34.960
Thank you, excellent, great.

53:34.960 --> 53:36.000
Just wanna get in on the wire.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.040
Just wanna get one last one.

53:37.040 --> 53:38.640
Oh, not on Christmas, though.

53:38.640 --> 53:40.000
On Christmas, excellent, great.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.280
Cool and great and cool.

53:42.160 --> 53:43.200
It's been a rough one.

53:43.200 --> 53:46.640
We've gotten a lot of, especially in the last, like, month or so,

53:46.640 --> 53:48.960
like, messages from people saying that the podcast

53:48.960 --> 53:52.160
and the other stuff we do has helped bring some,

53:52.160 --> 53:56.000
Joseph Gordon-Levitty to the stinkier.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.240
And I just wanna say, like,

53:58.240 --> 53:59.360
because we've gotten a lot of those messages,

53:59.360 --> 54:01.760
like, I wanna say that you all have also helped us

54:01.760 --> 54:02.960
get through this stinkier.

54:02.960 --> 54:06.000
And thank you all very, very much.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.280
And we won't be, we will not be stopped.

54:09.280 --> 54:11.120
We're gonna come at you hard in 2017.

54:12.160 --> 54:14.240
We're gonna just, we're gonna flood you with this stuff.

54:14.240 --> 54:18.240
And yeah, thank you all for being there for us.

54:18.240 --> 54:20.720
And we'll see you next time.

54:20.720 --> 54:25.040

54:33.040 --> 54:36.080
Here's your final Yahoo, final holiday Yahoo.

54:36.080 --> 54:38.080

54:38.080 --> 54:41.200
Thank you, Nicholas Potter, it's Yahoo Answers user.

54:41.200 --> 54:44.560
Sasa Sasa Sa, who says,

54:46.160 --> 54:50.000
if I send a spear into space and it pierces the sun,

54:50.000 --> 54:51.680
will the sun explode?

54:51.680 --> 54:56.240

55:21.440 --> 55:23.680

How do you know which stories are important?

Which sources do you trust
