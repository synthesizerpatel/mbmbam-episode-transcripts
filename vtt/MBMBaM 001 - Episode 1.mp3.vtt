00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

00:09.000 --> 00:19.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

00:54.000 --> 01:06.000
Every second, real time, this is why it's a modern show, it's every, every, now

01:06.000 --> 01:13.000
If you want to reach us, you can always ask a question

01:13.000 --> 01:25.000
On Twitter you can use the hashtag MBMBAM or you can email us, it's MBMBAM at gmail.com, that of course stands for my brother, my brother and me

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
Our original title was deemed too long

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
I actually have a list of some of the titles as we were spit balling

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
We'll go ahead and say yours because I know what you're going to

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
My personal favorite, it wasn't mine, I'm pretty sure you came up with it

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
It was absolutely mine

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Keenan and Kel and Justin and Travis and Griffin

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
Which is a better name than my brother, my brother and me

01:54.000 --> 02:05.000
And can you imagine after our first 350 episodes when we finally had the draw to get the KKs up on the show

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
The Keenan and Kel run off where people will want to listen for Keenan and Kel and then they're not there at first

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
Oh right, right, yeah, and you don't want to lose that demographic of Keenan and Kel

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
I also don't want to lose all of my orange soda because Kel would drink it right up

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
You know who loves orange soda?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
I've heard that Kel enjoys the occasional orange soda

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Loves orange soda

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
From time to time

02:30.000 --> 02:39.000
Guys, I don't actually, you'll have to forgive me, does drinking orange soda have racial connotations that maybe fans of Keenan and Kel

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Oh no, I didn't even think about that

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Does it?

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Guys, guys, listen, listen, I'm not racist, Keenan and Kel, I'm sorry

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Kel totally loves orange soda, that is the frequent subject on that show

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Yeah, this is a topic

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I get verified, he does, he does, he does

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
You tube it, just tube it

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
Side note, let's go ahead and derail this train of thought a little bit further

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
Kel I think was in a movie that I saw at the Blockbuster Video called Who Made the Potato Salad

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Yes, it was

03:10.000 --> 03:18.000
That was the last, that was in 1998 when I saw that video cassette on the store shelf and that was the last time I ever saw Kel Mitchell

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
He went into his novel writing career

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I don't actually think

03:23.000 --> 03:33.000
You know what's weird about that? By sheer serendipity, our first question this week on My Brother, My Brother and Me comes to us from the potato

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
The underscore potato on Twitter

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
He asks, I want a larger follower account but I'm finding it difficult to get more than two in a day, what can I do?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Start a bunch of accounts and have them follow each other

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah, we're talking about a question of determination, right?

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
You could open a business where you have a thousand accounts, right?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I don't think there's any limitation to that, right?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
It's not like Facebook, you can just, you know, shit and five Twitter accounts fall out

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
You could have this network and you could say, I will give you a thousand followers in a day, you just pay me fifty bucks

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
And then, you know, you're spending all day clicking the follow button but it's still fifty bucks

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
You know what I'm willing to bet? Someone is doing that somewhere

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
Tell me who they are and I'll shell out fifty bucks for a thousand

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
The question is really one of quality, right?

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
Like, if I see a funny tweet, usually I'm going to click on that name, I'm going to say, what are you offering?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
What's your story?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Right

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
You know, and I will look at them, I will read their words, I will open up their mind and see what's inside

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
If I'm climbing around in there and I like what I see, I like the territory, I'm going to state my claim

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Can I say, if you're getting two new followers a day, that ain't bad

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah, that's pretty good, because pretty soon, exponentially, they're going to start re-tweeting the funny shit you say

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
And then it's going to be three followers a day and then four followers a day and then, hold on, let me remember

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
I got to pull out my Fibonacci sequence, but I think it's sixty-two

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
Yeah, sixty-two and then from there, you just start tweeting about products you're using, sponsored tweets

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
And then boom

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Highway to the Danger Zone, you're rich

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
And you're famous

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yep

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
That's how it works

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
So?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
That's how you get money

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
That's how you get beebed

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah, that's how Bieber did it

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
Bieber started his career standing in the middle of malls, just singing at the top of his lungs

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Then two people came up and they're like, what are you doing? And he's like, exactly

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
He wasn't even singing at first, he was just like, just ate a sandwich at Subway, it was real good

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
But he had to say it in less than 140 letters

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Yeah

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Now he's on Saturday Night Live

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Now let's say, I don't know who Justin Bieber is, I know of his existence

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
So talented

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
I have no context

05:49.000 --> 05:56.000
Do you realize that that sort of like, that like, postmodern detachment from popular culture, that's not cool anymore

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Like, he was cool back in the early 2000s, but it's hot enough

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
I know, I said he has a funny game

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
No, no, no, no, he really is, like, this is me being completely unironic

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
You guys remember how I got on that Twilight kick?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Yeah

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
But you guys knew that it wasn't, I was being ironic

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
This is me, my most sincere Justin Bieber, super talented

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Watch him on Saturday Night Live last night

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Oh, he knew what was up

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
He knew how to work or shit

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
He was on Saturday Night Live, didn't he like, 8?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
What?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
He's like, 8

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
He's 13

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
He stayed up past his bedtime to rock us all

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
To sleep

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah, to rock you to sleep, ironic

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Cause like, I heard by 12 he was getting super cranky

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
He's like, I wanna go down

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
Well, you know, I believe that answers your question, who is Justin Bieber?

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Yeah, someone had to have asked her, right?

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Speaking of questions, this one comes from Yahoo

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
The question is, what is the chord progression during the intro of the ABC series, Greek?

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
What?

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Comes to us from Yahoo Answers user Rezuin

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Was it all in caps?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Was it all in caps?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
He had to know right this second

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
You know what, it's all actually, except he capitalized chord progression and intro, which, no

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
But he did put Greek in single apostrophes

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
What?

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Yeah, I know, it kind of followed AP style

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
So, Rezuin was

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
More importantly, what the fuck, man?

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
That's what you care about?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
What?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
What?

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Do you think that Rezuin is his Christian name?

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Or do you think that his manager, Arby's, is like, Rezuin, make all these tries

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
I think

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Rezuin, why don't you have a girlfriend?

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
More puzzling than his moniker is why he's trying to play the chord progression during the intro of the ABC series, Greek

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Sorry, let me finish the question

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
What is the chord progression, or is it from a song?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I'm not talking about the Plain White T's song

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
I'm talking about the short five second chord progression that plays during the intro to Greek in the current season

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Well, they're currently in season five

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
So, not to be confused with the progression

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
Don't get it twisted because the first four seasons opened up with Hey There Delilah by the Plain White T's

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
Now it's just a generic sort of four chord, you'd know it if you heard it

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah, of course

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
It's just a square, bar, bar, beep, right? That one?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
You play it by ear

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
I love that that's a concern, like that he watched the show and all he came away with was, what were those notes?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
What were those notes?

08:31.000 --> 08:40.000
I'll get that occasionally, like from a television show, like I'm sure that there have been, like a tailspin

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Sure

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
I'll learn the intro to a tailspin on guitar and then I will go and I will make that dream a reality

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
We're not talking about

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
We're not talking about a timeless children's cartoon classic

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
We're not talking about a song where you play it at a party and get the whole party rocking

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
We're talking about five notes where someone's like, what is that? Was that a song?

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Oh, you know, the beginning of Greek, just kicking it off

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
The beep, boop, bop, boop, beep song

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah, you know, from Greek

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Oh, wait a minute

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Wait a minute

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Not a few would have not recognized that upon hearing it

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
No one watches Greek, no one's ever seen it

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
No, no, listen, I got it, I just got confused

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
He said ABC series Greek

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
It's ABC family series

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Oh, right

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I have seen that show

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Okay, yeah, no, those five notes rule, they're epic, tears

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
I have the whole collection, the whole Greek, they call it the frat house box set duplex edition

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
It comes in a keg, which is nice

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
It comes in two kegs because there's a lot of discs

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
And as soon as you go to open it, it melts it down

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
As well it should be

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Great

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
It's a fine question and I don't have an answer for you

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Go play their music, go learn how to play

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
There's so many good songs

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Spambot wants to know

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
How do I get my incredibly talented artist friends to draw more?

10:03.000 --> 10:10.000
I don't think if your quote unquote incredibly talented artist friends

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
If they don't draw that frequently

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Then they're either not incredibly talented or they're not artists at all

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Or they're not your friends

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Well, no, I wouldn't go that far

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Maybe they're doing all this secret drawing and they're just keeping it

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Yeah, that's their real friends

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Oh shit, here comes Spambot, put the pencils down

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Put down the pencils

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
I don't want her to see, because every time he's like

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
That's a 20 minute conversation

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
He sees them working and it's oh I'm so glad to see you're doing that

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Keep it up, keep it up

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Whatever happened, you did two years at RISD and then you just bounced

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
What happened to your life?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Now you're doing sculpting, go back to drawing

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
My advice is this, most likely they know better than you know

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
How good they actually are

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Their advanced knowledge of the field

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Yeah, so you're looking at it going oh my god

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
But they've just been sketching Marvin the Martian

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
And you think it's funny and ironic but really they know it's Marvin the Martian

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Listen, I just drew this dog

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
You're an upside down heart and he's a happy dog

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
And you're like oh my god

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
And you're crying and moved

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Let them not draw that anymore

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
It's probably a good idea

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Here's another one from the Yahoo Contingency

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
This one's from Caitlin W

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
These are not our fans by the way

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Jump back real quick

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
You actually want them to draw more and encourage them

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Are you really just going to

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
No, no

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
We're done with here

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Here we go

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Headline, I went on a first date with this guy

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I didn't know what to say to him

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
So a guy I knew went on a date with me today

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
I was really excited beforehand and I couldn't wait to see him

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I really like him a lot, no words can describe it

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
So anyways, we went to a movie and then when it was over we walked around

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
But I didn't have much to say

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Neither did him

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
It felt sort of awkward

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I did want to say something, I just don't know what

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
So I hope to god that there's going to be another date with him soon

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
You know who I like? That quiet girl

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
She goes on to ask for topics

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
What struck me was, yeah we had this super awkward date

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Didn't have anything to talk about

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
Just three hours spent in the most horrifying silence imaginable

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
So can't wait for date two

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Date two, bring him back

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
He said he'd take me to Coldstone

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
At least at Coldstone you have

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
So what did you go with?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Cake batter and graham crackers

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Are the gummy bears in there?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
It's not a big deal

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Do you have a funny story about graham crackers?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I don't either

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
Can't wait to see you on date three

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
What time is it? It's only 7.21, oh my god

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
What time is your mom picking us up?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
You know the real awkward moment that had to be like

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
Hey, what are you writing on your phone?

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
I was just asking Yahoo

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
The date was going, I thought it was going pretty good

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Oh my god I didn't read the answers

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
There were no answers

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
I've already found my favorite

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
This one isn't my favorite

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I'm going to save the favorites

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Here's not my favorite

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Ooh, he probably thinks you're not interested in him now

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Text him now and say I really enjoyed our date with a smiley face

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
This is so important, the smiley face

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
One person says, Danny says well for my first dates I usually go on a double date

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
Well that makes, you know, I've played that game before

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Here's my favorite

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
This one's from Jack Daniels

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
One of the few people on Yahoo questions with an avatar and it's him

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
Ironically, if you're Jack Daniels you never have to worry about what to say next

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
It's just there

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
It's an avatar of him and he's wearing a backwards baseball hat

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
He's got headphones on and he's winking

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Wait, this is Jack Daniels with like the old black

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Jack Daniels avatar

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
It's like one of those fucking zwinkey

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Cartoon yourself

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Here's the answer, are you ready?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
No laughing, seriously

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
This was answered 23 minutes ago too, so this is hot off the oven

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
Shh, shh, shh, shh

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I can't do this

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Shh, shh, shh

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
Sometimes the quietest moments can say the most about yourself

14:47.000 --> 14:59.720
I'm literally creating a Yahoo Answers profile right now so that I can give his comment a

14:59.720 --> 15:04.440
thumbs up and make it the highest rated answer of all time.

15:04.440 --> 15:07.800
I would like to picture him really super drunk when he wrote that too.

15:07.800 --> 15:12.640
Hey Jack Daniels, can you take your headphones off and talk to me?

15:12.640 --> 15:14.120
No, girl, no.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.400
Listen, straight up.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.800
The quietest moments, girl.

15:17.800 --> 15:21.920
I just told this one bitch on Yahoo Answers, what's up?

15:21.920 --> 15:26.480
I just told her the quietest answers, you know?

15:26.480 --> 15:27.480
What's up?

15:27.480 --> 15:30.320
To be fair, his answer is all lower case twos.

15:30.320 --> 15:35.640
And you know what, he's right, because those quiet moments told her date, this is a terrible

15:35.640 --> 15:36.640
date.

15:36.640 --> 15:37.720
This is awful.

15:37.720 --> 15:41.120
You did in effect communicate more than you probably could have.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.120
Guess what?

15:42.120 --> 15:43.120
I'm boring.

15:43.120 --> 15:46.920
This is what it would be like forever if we got there.

15:46.920 --> 15:47.920
Forever.

15:47.920 --> 15:52.200
Can you imagine our children sitting in silence and staring at us and wondering why mom and

15:52.200 --> 15:53.200
daddy don't talk?

15:53.200 --> 15:54.200
Think of it.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.360
It's a world away, but it's really just a second date away.

15:57.360 --> 15:58.360
Call me.

15:58.360 --> 15:59.360
No, don't.

15:59.360 --> 16:05.400
Text me and then I won't answer and it will be like I'm there.

16:05.400 --> 16:08.760
Call me and I'll breathe into the phone for a while.

16:08.760 --> 16:16.640
Suzanne, I believe it's I-L-E-S, but it could be two L's at the end.

16:16.640 --> 16:21.560
She's actually from County Cork, according to her Twitter profile.

16:21.560 --> 16:26.740
She wants to know how she can add oh, about 10 hours to her day.

16:26.740 --> 16:33.960
Now this is of course impossible, but time management, what's the secret?

16:33.960 --> 16:39.200
I really need advice on how to add oh, about 10 hours to my day.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.200
Could you help?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.800
We can, of course.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.440
We always have an answer.

16:44.440 --> 16:48.760
The not sleeping thing is good, but not jokingly, like sleep less.

16:48.760 --> 16:52.680
Go to sleep earlier, wake up earlier.

16:52.680 --> 16:53.680
I don't agree.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.680
I don't agree.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.680
I don't agree with that.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.160
I think your sleep time is so important.

16:57.160 --> 17:01.800
It is important, but you don't have to do 13 hours of it.

17:01.800 --> 17:05.760
You've got to take good care of yourself and then get, I don't know, seven?

17:05.760 --> 17:06.800
Here's the way I look at it.

17:06.800 --> 17:11.560
Go to sleep later, but wake up at the same time because that's so much for me is I wake

17:11.560 --> 17:16.960
up earlier and I'm tired even if I got the same amount of sleep.

17:16.960 --> 17:24.920
Do you know what another good one that I've been working on in that just don't try your

17:24.920 --> 17:30.640
very best to not read anything.

17:30.640 --> 17:37.840
Because every second you spend, not even a book, but on the internet, every second or

17:37.840 --> 17:47.160
a road sign or instructions for medicine, those are minutes a day that you spend reading

17:47.160 --> 17:50.360
that you could spend doing other things.

17:50.360 --> 17:55.000
You can read a lot and if you cut that out of your regimen, oh, it's so much time.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.120
You'll be amazed at how the day opens up to you.

17:57.120 --> 18:01.240
In the news biz, we have something called the Inverted Pyramid where the most important

18:01.240 --> 18:02.640
stuff is at the top.

18:02.640 --> 18:07.480
So basically, just read the headline and if you're not getting the news, then they let

18:07.480 --> 18:08.480
you down.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.200
You have to read beyond that.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.680
I should have been more specific.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.480
Just don't read the news either.

18:13.480 --> 18:17.120
There's not much of a reason to read it.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.760
Once you read the news, it's already happened.

18:19.760 --> 18:20.760
That's past.

18:20.760 --> 18:21.760
That's done.

18:21.760 --> 18:22.760
That's back.

18:22.760 --> 18:23.760
You know what?

18:23.760 --> 18:25.320
Another thing people do is they do things too many times.

18:25.320 --> 18:29.520
You go to hug someone and you start the hug and it's like, yes, I get you're hugging

18:29.520 --> 18:30.520
me.

18:30.520 --> 18:34.960
You start enjoying it too much and you're there for, what, 20-30 minutes.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.260
Just give them a quick in and out.

18:36.260 --> 18:37.960
You give them a quick hug, you're done.

18:37.960 --> 18:41.600
The hug is accomplished and then you just picked up 20 minutes.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.600
Also, stop eating.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.600
No, eating's cool.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.600
No, eating's down.

18:44.600 --> 18:45.600
Eating's pretty cool.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.240
I'm saying that you need to reevaluate.

18:49.240 --> 18:53.400
You need to look at the things in your life that you're doing and you need to figure

18:53.400 --> 18:56.480
out what you would rather be doing with that time.

18:56.480 --> 18:59.280
Also, it seems counterintuitive, midday nap.

18:59.280 --> 19:03.800
Just super energizing, get yourself a piziz going, just in and out.

19:03.800 --> 19:13.200
If you can get a 20-minute power nap in midday, then the rest of the day is going to feel

19:13.200 --> 19:14.200
longer.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.200
It's a little secret.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.200
Right.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.200
Well, pro tip.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.200
It's about perception.

19:18.200 --> 19:22.360
It's a question of perception.

19:22.360 --> 19:26.280
Brian Gann is afraid of bees, wasps, and hornets.

19:26.280 --> 19:27.280
Should be.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.920
He said, when he wears red shirts in the spring, he seemed to go near me.

19:29.920 --> 19:30.920
What do I do?

19:30.920 --> 19:31.920
Don't go outside.

19:31.920 --> 19:38.040
Okay, first off, that's a perfect – we have so many fears that are irrational.

19:38.040 --> 19:43.080
The fear of stinging insects is a direct – celebrate that fear.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.640
That's exactly right.

19:44.640 --> 19:45.640
Yes.

19:45.640 --> 19:48.040
I'm being afraid of a shark that's swimming near me.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.040
Yeah.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.040
Yeah, absolutely.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.040
Yeah, I'm afraid of that shark.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.040
Absolutely.

19:52.040 --> 19:57.120
I mean, the smart ass answer is, don't wear a red shirt.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.120
He doesn't have a choice.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.120
That's what I said.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.120
But I –

20:00.120 --> 20:03.520
The Enterprise captain told him that he doesn't have long for this world, so he's wearing

20:03.520 --> 20:04.520
a red shirt.

20:04.520 --> 20:05.520
He's going to get skooked.

20:05.520 --> 20:06.520
But I get –

20:06.520 --> 20:10.760
Going to get a planet floor and get skooked by some multi-tentacled fixer wheel.

20:10.760 --> 20:18.760
I understand that I have so few shirts in my life that I think I have a good, positive

20:18.760 --> 20:22.000
body image when I'm wearing, and one of them is red.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.960
And maybe Ryan's in the same boat where he's got this sweet ass red shirt that he

20:25.960 --> 20:29.200
got at PacSun, and it makes him feel good to wear it.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.200
Griffin is sort of like Doug Funne.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.200
It makes him feel good to wear it.

20:32.200 --> 20:35.400
Griffin has fundamentally what is a uniform, the Griffin uniform.

20:35.400 --> 20:39.280
You open up his closet, it's 20 of this red shirt from PacSun.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.280
An all snap button shirt.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.280
It's red flannel –

20:41.280 --> 20:42.280
Slacks, a cock ring.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.280
It's red flannel –

20:43.280 --> 20:44.280
A cock ring.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.600
It's the same every day.

20:46.600 --> 20:47.600
And his mask.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.100
A red cock ring.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.400
But I understand what he's saying.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.520
Not wearing the red shirt is not an option because if you stop wearing the red shirt,

20:55.520 --> 20:57.940
then the terrorist wasps win.

20:57.940 --> 21:05.840
So what you can do is you can spitz yourself with off, but that's not – you don't

21:05.840 --> 21:08.020
want that scent following you around.

21:08.020 --> 21:10.880
I heard about these things.

21:10.880 --> 21:11.880
They are medallions.

21:11.880 --> 21:17.640
They're medallions that you can either snap to your belt or I guess wear around your neck.

21:17.640 --> 21:24.920
They're not particularly stylish, but they exude off or some sort of bug repellent.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.760
That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard.

21:27.760 --> 21:30.560
No, it's not like a – why is it disgusting?

21:30.560 --> 21:31.560
It's not unsanitary.

21:31.560 --> 21:32.560
It's like a little cunt.

21:32.560 --> 21:36.560
No, because I'm picturing wearing it like a necklace and it just exuding off.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.560
It's really gross.

21:37.560 --> 21:39.880
Like ants who lost pheromones.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.480
What do you smell like?

21:41.480 --> 21:42.480
You smell like off.

21:42.480 --> 21:43.480
You have a deet.

21:43.480 --> 21:44.480
You have a deet-esque aroma.

21:44.480 --> 21:48.040
You have a real strong citronella smell.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.040
Citronella.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.480
Sort of a citronella meets off.

21:51.480 --> 21:52.480
And ass.

21:52.480 --> 21:53.480
And just an ass.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.480
You smell like ass.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.480
Like an ass.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.480
Dude, that medallion though.

21:56.480 --> 21:57.480
But you look awesome.

21:57.480 --> 21:58.480
You look fucking beautiful.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.840
It looks really great with that red shirt.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.120
It all colludes.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.040
Are we talking about like an enchantment?

22:03.040 --> 22:04.040
Is this more of an enchantment?

22:04.040 --> 22:05.040
I would say –

22:05.040 --> 22:08.840
The only medallions that I know of are either beef or enchanted.

22:08.840 --> 22:09.840
Here's what you do.

22:09.840 --> 22:13.160
You go down to the magic store and you tell them that you're having a wasp issue.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.160
A wasp issue.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.160
We're not talking about it.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.160
Don't worry.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.160
He's got it.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.160
It's very old.

22:18.160 --> 22:22.880
He goes down to the medallion wing of the magic store.

22:22.880 --> 22:23.880
Gets you a medallion.

22:23.880 --> 22:24.880
Not a big deal.

22:24.880 --> 22:30.040
The other thing you can do is just run away from them as fast as you can.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.680
They're really small.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.240
Make sure you scream like a girl too.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.240
That's really important.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.360
That is a natural defense.

22:37.360 --> 22:42.760
Travis and I in our Cincinnati love nest, we have a balcony and I'll occasionally

22:42.760 --> 22:45.280
go up there and play guitar for all the children.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.280
The small children.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.280
He plays the five chords from Greek.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.800
I play the five chords from Greek over and over again.

22:49.800 --> 22:55.040
Sometimes I'm just having a good time playing a mellow Greek jam and then like three big

22:55.040 --> 22:59.280
fat bumblebees will come up and like start a jam.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.280
Is that Greek?

23:00.280 --> 23:01.440
Are you playing Greek?

23:01.440 --> 23:05.840
These motherfuckers, they are plump with blood, I think.

23:05.840 --> 23:06.840
Yes.

23:06.840 --> 23:07.840
Yes.

23:07.840 --> 23:11.120
Bees that carry blood from birches can inject them with blood.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.240
I've seen bees and that's how babies are made.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.240
That's how babies are made.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.240
Exactly, Travis.

23:15.240 --> 23:19.240
That is the best bees I've ever seen and they'll just rush me and I have to get up

23:19.240 --> 23:24.040
in the middle of my jam and squeal and just throw the screen door open and get inside

23:24.040 --> 23:25.040
it.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.040
I just bought this new guitar.

23:26.040 --> 23:30.280
I don't care if it slams into the brick wall as I'm getting into the building and shutting

23:30.280 --> 23:31.760
the screen door behind me.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.640
It's terrifying but you just got to get out of there.

23:33.640 --> 23:36.440
It's just one of those things you have to deal with.

23:36.440 --> 23:37.440
You know what?

23:37.440 --> 23:38.440
That's life.

23:38.440 --> 23:41.160
Scratty Bones, do you guys know him?

23:41.160 --> 23:42.720
Scratty Bones on Twitter.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.480
Scratty Bones Jones?

23:44.480 --> 23:46.280
Scratty Bones Jones.

23:46.280 --> 23:49.400
How many times a week should I shampoo my hair?

23:49.400 --> 23:53.920
I'm currently on a wash thrice shampoo every third wash cycle.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.800
Okay, we're going to get just real talk here.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.760
Yeah, you just entered into our wheelhouse.

23:59.760 --> 24:03.560
Listen, this is a matter of some debate for men of dry hair.

24:03.560 --> 24:09.640
Let me open up by saying I didn't know this is one of those many, many things that I as

24:09.640 --> 24:16.920
a 22-year-old adult should know and incorporate in my life but I shampoo my hair every time

24:16.920 --> 24:17.920
I get in the shower.

24:17.920 --> 24:18.920
See?

24:18.920 --> 24:19.920
That's why you've got that close hair.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.720
That's why you've got that hair like you have.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.640
You're having an awakening.

24:24.640 --> 24:28.360
Guys, it's our first awakening.

24:28.360 --> 24:29.360
I feel like when I don't…

24:29.360 --> 24:31.960
You're listening to awakenings with Justin Travis and Chris and the rest.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.320
I feel like I'm getting dirty.

24:34.320 --> 24:35.320
If I don't do it, I feel dirty.

24:35.320 --> 24:41.480
The thing is the natural oils that your scalp produces makes your hair look…

24:41.480 --> 24:43.560
Think of it from a caveman era.

24:43.560 --> 24:46.080
Your body biologically wants your hair to look better.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.000
It's trying to make your hair look better.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.360
It's doing what it can to help you.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.200
I like the three-day rotation.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.560
I like the three-day rotation.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.560
I am down.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.400
Now sometimes, what's the problem?

24:56.400 --> 25:00.760
You've got to get in there on that third day with a real hard scrub or your scalp's

25:00.760 --> 25:02.440
going to go to shit.

25:02.440 --> 25:05.080
That's the nightmare scenario.

25:05.080 --> 25:08.480
When my hair gets longer and I know I'm running my hands through it a lot and getting

25:08.480 --> 25:11.640
it real gross, I'll do a two-day rotation.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.640
Sure.

25:12.640 --> 25:13.640
Yeah.

25:13.640 --> 25:18.800
If you use a lot of products one day and you've got to get away from that feeling…

25:18.800 --> 25:19.800
You know what?

25:19.800 --> 25:23.800
I would also, if that's not good for you, get yourself a nice smoothing gel, something

25:23.800 --> 25:25.720
that's going to reduce that frizz for you.

25:25.720 --> 25:29.680
My man Sunny, my gay Persian hairstylist, the master cuts.

25:29.680 --> 25:31.440
That's my boy Sunny.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.840
He said, oh, we'll get you something that looks real good, buddy.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.400
That's what he always says no matter how he cuts it.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.400
Wait a minute, Sunny.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.400
I know that fool.

25:37.400 --> 25:38.960
He used to work at Fantastic Sam's, right?

25:38.960 --> 25:39.960
Yeah.

25:39.960 --> 25:40.960
Yeah.

25:40.960 --> 25:41.960
And he migrated.

25:41.960 --> 25:42.960
He migrated.

25:42.960 --> 25:43.960
He looked like a beautiful…

25:43.960 --> 25:44.960
Two more gay Persian-friendly things.

25:44.960 --> 25:45.960
Yeah.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.720
The Fantastic Sam's wasn't gay Persian-friendly enough for Sunny.

25:48.720 --> 25:51.240
Well, with a name like Fantastic Sam's, I mean…

25:51.240 --> 25:52.240
Yeah, you think.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.200
Oh, you know, they're real heterosexual American-friendly.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.200
You know what's adorable?

25:55.200 --> 25:56.200
You know what's adorable?

25:56.200 --> 26:00.960
He says, so I say, I'm always going on a Friday for some reason, and he says, so what

26:00.960 --> 26:03.040
are you doing this weekend, buddy?

26:03.040 --> 26:05.040
You know, I'll tell him whatever boring shit I'm doing.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.680
He said, I'm going to go down to this new gay bar.

26:07.680 --> 26:13.720
It's called whatever, Accelerate or whatever the new gay bar is, Shamanigans.

26:13.720 --> 26:18.680
I want to go down to the Shamanigans, and you know, my friends, they always drag me

26:18.680 --> 26:19.680
to these gay bars.

26:19.680 --> 26:20.680
I don't know, buddy.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.680
And it's like, come on.

26:21.680 --> 26:22.680
Come on, Sunny.

26:22.680 --> 26:23.680
I don't even know what's going on.

26:23.680 --> 26:24.680
Come on.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.680
I mean, I'm impeccably dressed.

26:26.680 --> 26:27.680
Come on.

26:27.680 --> 26:28.680
I don't care.

26:28.680 --> 26:30.840
It's sad.

26:30.840 --> 26:37.600
The region we live in, he's been conditioned to try to keep that on the DL, but no, he's

26:37.600 --> 26:38.600
great.

26:38.600 --> 26:46.080
Anyway, my man, Sunny, my boy Sunny, he says to use the, he says that I should use a smoothing

26:46.080 --> 26:47.080
gel, so I do.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.080
Just a nice…

26:48.080 --> 26:50.240
It's important to note, you should still rinse your hair out.

26:50.240 --> 26:53.360
You should get in the shower and rinse your hair, because if not, that's gross.

26:53.360 --> 27:00.280
There's one unsolved mystery here, because you guys obviously know more about this than

27:00.280 --> 27:06.920
I do, but if you don't shampoo your hair, then how are you supposed to put shampoo in

27:06.920 --> 27:11.880
your hair and let the suds run down, and then just use those suds as soap?

27:11.880 --> 27:12.880
Right?

27:12.880 --> 27:13.880
Oh, okay.

27:13.880 --> 27:18.120
Listen, great question, but I pass the head all together, go straight to the chest hair.

27:18.120 --> 27:23.720
You're telling me that I shouldn't use soap, is what I'm hearing, except for every Wednesday

27:23.720 --> 27:26.040
and Saturday.

27:26.040 --> 27:31.620
I think that this grooming section, I'm going to, has taken a weird turn where it's more

27:31.620 --> 27:32.620
about…

27:32.620 --> 27:33.620
How gross Griffin is?

27:33.620 --> 27:36.880
Just a terrible life of Griffin Mackerel, it's weird.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.280
It started out as about one thing, now it's kind of depressing.

27:39.280 --> 27:44.040
I'm as clean as a motherfucker, but I do it in suspect ways.

27:44.040 --> 27:45.040
Yeah, yeah.

27:45.040 --> 27:51.520
He's going for that every man, I've got this, why not just combine the two tasks?

27:51.520 --> 27:57.320
I operate outside of the accepted social norms when it comes to showering.

27:57.320 --> 28:04.280
This has gone from a Dear Abby column to a photocopied independent comic that someone

28:04.280 --> 28:08.280
on the streets of Brooklyn would hand you where it's like, my terrible life, what

28:08.280 --> 28:10.120
a wreck I am.

28:10.120 --> 28:13.520
Or perhaps an intervention.

28:13.520 --> 28:18.760
So apparently, Suzanne, if you want to shave a few minutes from your day, just use your

28:18.760 --> 28:20.720
shampoo for soap.

28:20.720 --> 28:21.720
Like a monster.

28:21.720 --> 28:22.720
And then cry.

28:22.720 --> 28:23.720
Cry for it.

28:23.720 --> 28:24.720
Just cry yourself.

28:24.720 --> 28:28.320
How much time do you have to black out for crying?

28:28.320 --> 28:31.720
Before next week's show, I'm going to get a bar of soap, I'm going to get a thing

28:31.720 --> 28:36.920
of shampoo, and I'm going to read off the ingredients in both, and it's going to be

28:36.920 --> 28:37.920
the same.

28:37.920 --> 28:38.920
Wait, can I, can I, can I, Griffin, can I say?

28:38.920 --> 28:39.920
I'm so embarrassed.

28:39.920 --> 28:40.920
Griffin, are you conditioning?

28:40.920 --> 28:41.920
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:41.920 --> 28:42.920
Okay.

28:42.920 --> 28:43.920
All right.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.320
Oh, see, but you don't want to do that every day either.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.120
No, I do that every, I do that twice.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.120
I do that twice a day.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.120
No, you do not do that.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.120
What?

28:51.120 --> 28:52.120
I do not.

28:52.120 --> 28:53.120
Yeah, you didn't know that?

28:53.120 --> 28:54.840
I'll carry a little bottle of shampoo, of conditioner around with me.

28:54.840 --> 28:55.840
I'll do it in the shower.

28:55.840 --> 28:56.840
Oh, no, no, no.

28:56.840 --> 28:57.840
And then just like after lunch, I'll just.

28:57.840 --> 28:58.840
You don't want to condition every day.

28:58.840 --> 28:59.840
Dry.

28:59.840 --> 29:04.480
Every time, every time I go to get my hair cut, when I get my hair cut, the girl's like,

29:04.480 --> 29:06.560
have you conditioned yesterday or today?

29:06.560 --> 29:08.200
And if I say yes, she won't do it.

29:08.200 --> 29:11.120
Like, because you lose manageability of your hair.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.120
That's like, I know.

29:12.120 --> 29:17.440
But like, your hair should be somewhat coarse so it holds a natural shape.

29:17.440 --> 29:24.000
Working Stiff Pro says, yeah, this is our settled cue.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.880
Dear MBMBAM, I'm looking for love.

29:26.880 --> 29:29.920
Not the sicko type, but if I find that, I'm not opposed.

29:29.920 --> 29:30.920
Hey.

29:30.920 --> 29:31.920
Nice.

29:31.920 --> 29:32.920
Keep it open.

29:32.920 --> 29:33.920
Any ideas?

29:33.920 --> 29:36.080
I think that you've got to stick up your ass.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.480
I don't think you should.

29:38.480 --> 29:41.760
If you ain't got love, you shouldn't be able to, you know, cast aspersions, but.

29:41.760 --> 29:46.360
Yeah, maybe you get that weird love, that love with a pillow shaped like a person love.

29:46.360 --> 29:49.480
Who's to say that's not love though, right?

29:49.480 --> 29:50.480
Like in that person's mind.

29:50.480 --> 29:54.600
I actually, I just had my mind changed on internet dating.

29:54.600 --> 29:55.600
Yeah.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.600
Um, like I was talking to a female friend of mine and all she does is internet dating

29:59.600 --> 30:03.240
because in her mind she doesn't have time to go through all the shit of like going to

30:03.240 --> 30:08.120
a bar and like the guy she works with, she sees every day so she doesn't want to do that.

30:08.120 --> 30:09.320
And I was like, you know what?

30:09.320 --> 30:11.440
I had been judging that too harshly.

30:11.440 --> 30:16.440
Now that being said, ladies, don't get near that Craigslist.

30:16.440 --> 30:24.200
Freaks on the internet do not trust people in anything, but I now see that as a viable

30:24.200 --> 30:26.280
like, hey, good work.

30:26.280 --> 30:28.880
If you want to go through internet dating and that's your jam, do it.

30:28.880 --> 30:29.880
Don't be ashamed of it.

30:29.880 --> 30:34.040
But even when that internet dating is like a Craigslist listing, it's like, hey, how's

30:34.040 --> 30:35.040
it going?

30:35.040 --> 30:36.040
You want to come over and hang out?

30:36.040 --> 30:38.920
We can watch movies and you can jerk off, you can jerk off my dog.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.920
No, wait a second.

30:40.920 --> 30:45.120
But that's still love for that person.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.160
Go to a community.

30:46.160 --> 30:52.320
If you're going to shop online for dudes or chicks, ladies, excuse me, make sure it's

30:52.320 --> 30:56.440
a community you trust like the NB, NBAM community of fans.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.440
Lots of singles.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.160
Lots of singles just mixing it up in there.

31:00.160 --> 31:01.160
Pics only, please.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.160
Pics only.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.160
Yeah, pics only.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.160
SL.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.160
And no fatties.

31:05.160 --> 31:08.560
Best way to do it, meet new people, dude.

31:08.560 --> 31:09.640
Just meet new people.

31:09.640 --> 31:11.440
Every day, meet some new people.

31:11.440 --> 31:16.760
Yeah, get a – and remember, here's a good tip for life.

31:16.760 --> 31:21.320
Remember it's impossible to get someone interested in you, so be interested in other

31:21.320 --> 31:22.320
people.

31:22.320 --> 31:25.320
That's the secret to success.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.600
Everybody wants to be – feel like people are interested in them.

31:27.600 --> 31:31.920
Get interested in other people and the love, the love will find you.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.580
And here's my secret trick, dude.

31:33.580 --> 31:37.800
When you go out and you're looking for a girl, have girls with you.

31:37.800 --> 31:38.960
Girls will trust you so much more.

31:38.960 --> 31:39.960
That's good too, yeah.

31:39.960 --> 31:40.960
That's good too.

31:40.960 --> 31:43.720
Because that's the thing, because there's always that natural like I feel creepy walking

31:43.720 --> 31:46.560
up to a girl at a bar and be like, hey, baby, can I buy you a drink?

31:46.560 --> 31:50.520
But if you have another girl with you, that's a litmus test for that girl like, oh, this

31:50.520 --> 31:52.880
dude's not a super creepo serial killer.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.520
I can at least chat with them for now.

31:55.520 --> 31:56.520
And then don't push it.

31:56.520 --> 31:57.520
Don't push it.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.440
If you're like, can I buy you a drink?

31:59.440 --> 32:03.360
You have a good 10-minute conversation, be like, all right, that's a W. And if we come

32:03.360 --> 32:09.320
back and talk again later, great, but don't try to move from 10-minute conversation to

32:09.320 --> 32:11.120
so do you want to get married?

32:11.120 --> 32:16.040
Just like enjoy that 10 minutes and then, you know, see how it goes later.

32:16.040 --> 32:24.480
Or another option, don't feel like you have to be in love with somebody, you know?

32:24.480 --> 32:25.480
I've got a pretty good life.

32:25.480 --> 32:28.560
I'm not, you know, I'm single, no prospects.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.160
I eat, I eat, I eat.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.360
And he also shampoos every day.

32:32.360 --> 32:36.440
Water laced, shampoo with soap, Griffin McElroy, it's on the market.

32:36.440 --> 32:41.520
At 12.30, I wanted to have a hot dog and a soda, but we didn't have buns.

32:41.520 --> 32:45.680
We had some leftover brats that my brother made last night on the grill.

32:45.680 --> 32:46.680
And I cut it up.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.560
That was already a week old, important to note.

32:48.560 --> 32:55.560
Put it in ramen and I didn't have soda, so I drank beer and it was 12, it was 12 o'clock.

32:55.560 --> 32:59.120
So you don't need any, you don't need, you know, if you have someone, they could tell

32:59.120 --> 33:03.160
you not to do that.

33:03.160 --> 33:05.360
It doesn't matter, sicko, it doesn't matter, love.

33:05.360 --> 33:06.360
You just need someone to tell you.

33:06.360 --> 33:10.720
Just so long as they have enough cognizant awareness to say, hey, don't eat brat and

33:10.720 --> 33:11.720
ramen and beer.

33:11.720 --> 33:12.720
It's 12 o'clock.

33:12.720 --> 33:13.720
You're nicer.

33:13.720 --> 33:14.720
Go outside.

33:14.720 --> 33:15.720
You need people in your life.

33:15.720 --> 33:21.160
You need, I've got Justin and Travis, without them, fuck, I would be, I would be, just eat

33:21.160 --> 33:22.160
the shampoo.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.200
I would get confused.

33:24.200 --> 33:28.000
And then rub the ramen all over yourself, that's why I'm not willing to say he has not

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
done.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.640
So, well, look, when you don't have a loofah, sometimes you don't have a loofah.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.860
Desperate times call for desperate loofahs.

33:35.860 --> 33:38.120
This one comes from Yahoo.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.720
Open question from Tara, the top contributor.

33:40.720 --> 33:44.840
I don't know if that means like of all time or just for today, but the question is, what

33:44.840 --> 33:51.920
is the first song that comes to mind when I say the word party?

33:51.920 --> 33:55.340
I'm pretty sure I know what Justin's answer would be to that question.

33:55.340 --> 33:59.920
You know what, I'm going to say that the top answer on this Yahoo question is the correct

33:59.920 --> 34:00.920
one.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.720
Is it Andrew WK's?

34:02.720 --> 34:03.720
Party Hard?

34:03.720 --> 34:04.760
No, it is on, that is on there.

34:04.760 --> 34:07.160
What about DMX's Party Up In Here?

34:07.160 --> 34:11.160
I don't actually see that on the list.

34:11.160 --> 34:15.560
If we're assuming that the answers that have been given are indeed the correct answers.

34:15.560 --> 34:20.280
I have one more guess, Lionel Richie's All Night Long.

34:20.280 --> 34:21.280
No.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.280
Close.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.920
Party All The Time by Eddie Murphy is one of the top answers.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.880
That's not the top answer.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.240
Someone said Birthday by the Beatles.

34:28.240 --> 34:33.560
Actually, no, that's the worst song ever recorded.

34:33.560 --> 34:38.760
Party in the USA is on here a couple of times by musical ingenue Miley Cyrus.

34:38.760 --> 34:43.000
She wrote the Greek theme song.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.360
The top answer though, do you guys really not know it?

34:47.360 --> 34:48.360
Tell me.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.500
I guarantee you know it if you think.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.120
I will probably know it once you say it.

34:52.120 --> 34:54.880
I mean, I will be familiar.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.600
It's Hollywood Nights by Pete Seeger.

34:56.600 --> 35:02.600
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.400
That's the best answer ever.

35:04.400 --> 35:05.720
I mean, that's a very good answer.

35:05.720 --> 35:09.500
I mean, it should come to your mind when someone's trying to get the party started.

35:09.500 --> 35:14.400
No one's ever been having a bad time and someone dropped shots and everyone's like,

35:14.400 --> 35:17.460
I don't know, no, it's time.

35:17.460 --> 35:21.680
There are two words in that song that always make me go, well, yeah, and it's buttery

35:21.680 --> 35:22.680
nipples.

35:22.680 --> 35:26.920
And when they say it, oh, that is heaven, that is heaven.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.800
For me, it's shots and shots.

35:29.800 --> 35:30.800
And then they say.

35:30.800 --> 35:35.280
The 23rd and 28th instances of the words being used.

35:35.280 --> 35:38.680
And I think it's the best usage of Little John I've ever seen.

35:38.680 --> 35:39.680
God.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.360
The best use of the force that is Little John.

35:42.360 --> 35:46.740
I think the best use of Little John was that time when my car broke down and he pulled

35:46.740 --> 35:49.880
over to help me with my tire.

35:49.880 --> 35:50.880
That was pretty cool.

35:50.880 --> 35:51.880
It was nice.

35:51.880 --> 35:55.440
I was like, I'm right here, John.

35:55.440 --> 35:56.440
You don't.

35:56.440 --> 35:57.440
Little John.

35:57.440 --> 35:58.440
Old John.

35:58.440 --> 35:59.760
I don't know.

35:59.760 --> 36:02.120
You look about the same height as me.

36:02.120 --> 36:06.760
I will just pass you the one that you don't need to yell.

36:06.760 --> 36:07.760
Unnecessary.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.240
Now I really want to listen to shots.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.240
Unfortunately, that's.

36:10.240 --> 36:11.240
It's the theme song to our show.

36:11.240 --> 36:12.240
It's the theme song of my life.

36:12.240 --> 36:13.240
It's a sad thing to say out loud.

36:13.240 --> 36:14.240
Yeah.

36:14.240 --> 36:15.240
I can't think of a finer, finer moment.

36:15.240 --> 36:32.240
I think it would be good for us when we end each show to have one question that we announce

36:32.240 --> 36:37.480
at the end of the show and then just ruminate on until the start of the next week's show

36:37.480 --> 36:41.080
once we've had a week to think about it.

36:41.080 --> 36:42.080
You have a question, don't you?

36:42.080 --> 36:43.080
I have it.

36:43.080 --> 36:44.080
Yes.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.080
That's what I thought.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.080
Absolutely.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.680
So you let me know when you're ready for the end to come.

36:48.680 --> 36:53.480
Justin, if they want to contact us, what's the best way to get a question out into the

36:53.480 --> 36:55.600
Ethernet for us?

36:55.600 --> 37:09.120
You just use the Twitter and use the hashtag NBNBAM or you can use the Internet, say email.

37:09.120 --> 37:14.920
It's NBNBAM at gmail.com and we will have more options for you as we progress.

37:14.920 --> 37:21.040
Whatever other things are in the works, but for now, that's how we roll.

37:21.040 --> 37:27.320
Final question of the day from Yahoo Answers user Mallie.

37:27.320 --> 37:31.720
Can birds get allergies?

37:31.720 --> 37:33.080
I'm Justin McElroy.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.280
I'm Griffin McElroy.

37:34.280 --> 37:35.280
I'm Travis McElroy.

37:35.280 --> 37:39.520
And this has been my brother, my brother, and me.

37:39.520 --> 37:56.760
You will never know me.

37:56.760 --> 38:11.960
I'm Travis McElroy and I'll see you next time.
