WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
Hey everybody, this is my brother, my brother, me, I'm Justin, et cetera, et cetera, we do all that shit later.

00:05.040 --> 00:10.020
But I wanted to step in real quick before you start listening to the show. It was recorded live at Milwaukee's

00:10.520 --> 00:13.740
beautiful Turner Hall. It gets really weird at the end,

00:14.040 --> 00:18.000
so make sure you check out the whole thing. And if this leaves a taste in your mouth

00:18.440 --> 00:22.800
for wanting a good taste that you want to taste more of our live performances.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.240
A taste-tation, if you will.

00:24.240 --> 00:28.080
A taste-tation, and you live in the Pacific Northwest, you can do exactly that. Travis, tell them how.

00:28.080 --> 00:31.560
Well, we've got three shows. One in Seattle. Were you jerking off?

00:32.200 --> 00:36.040
What? Were you jerking off and that's why you didn't respond quickly?

00:36.520 --> 00:41.620
Why is that where you went? I don't know. I thought I heard some jerk noises. Go ahead, Travis. Go ahead and hit me.

00:41.880 --> 00:45.800
Okay, we've got three shows. One in Portland, then Seattle, then Vancouver.

00:46.320 --> 00:56.120
The links you're looking for are bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Seattle, bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Portland,

00:56.120 --> 01:01.560
and bit.ly forward slash V-A-N-M-B-M-B-A-M.

01:01.560 --> 01:07.660
It's the end of August is when we're gonna when we're going to visit ourselves upon you. P-N-W.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.920
By the way, the Vancouver show and the

01:13.040 --> 01:20.080
Seattle show are reserved seating, so don't sleep. And Portland's almost sold out, so super don't sleep on that one.

01:20.080 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, don't sleep on any of them. But anyway, here's our Milwaukee episode. I hope you enjoy it.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.200
Thank you, Milwaukee, for the good times, if you know what I mean.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.960
We had sex with Milwaukee.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.560
Here we go. And their advice should never be followed.

01:36.680 --> 01:41.500
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

01:42.200 --> 01:48.760
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

01:48.760 --> 01:55.760
What's up, you cool, baby?

02:18.760 --> 02:24.760
What's up, Milwaukee?

02:28.100 --> 02:32.600
What did you do? What did you do? Let's start this show with a fucking confession. What did you do?

02:33.860 --> 02:39.820
What did you do? I left my computer upstairs. You left your computer upstairs. Why would you need a computer for a comedy podcast?

02:39.820 --> 02:41.820
I don't know. It's all up here.

02:42.940 --> 02:45.020
Okay, what's our first question, Justin?

02:45.020 --> 02:49.180
My brother forgot his laptop.

02:50.540 --> 02:54.700
There are 600 people watching. What do I do?

02:56.420 --> 02:58.420
Oh my god, there's a lot of people out here.

02:59.060 --> 03:01.060
So what's going on, guys?

03:02.060 --> 03:03.820
I really liked when we were doing the soundcheck.

03:03.820 --> 03:09.940
The sound guy was like, it's gonna sound a lot different when this room is full of meat baffling. And I was like, that's great.

03:09.940 --> 03:14.900
Yeah, I just, that's our first joke of the night, and it was stolen.

03:14.900 --> 03:20.380
So let's see, you already stole the Milwaukee. You talked about the Wisconsin Dells.

03:20.500 --> 03:26.940
No, we didn't finish talking about the Wisconsin Dells. Here's a funny story. Have you ever been to it? I was about to call it...

03:28.620 --> 03:33.740
I was like, if you haven't, go right now. Yeah, it's amazing.

03:33.740 --> 03:40.740
It's, I was about to call it the Pigeon Forge of Wisconsin, but... Wow, okay, yeah, a lot of people have made that announcement.

03:40.740 --> 03:42.740
That hit better than I thought it would.

03:44.180 --> 03:47.380
Someone real anti-Pigeon Forge. Yeah.

03:48.420 --> 03:51.900
I know they're not anti-Dells, because how the fuck could you be?

03:52.500 --> 03:55.260
They got Wizard Quest. They have a place called...

03:55.260 --> 04:03.580
Oh, yeah, some Wizard Quest fans in the house. Some Questos in the house. The most direct titling of an adventure ever,

04:03.980 --> 04:05.980
Ghost Boat. Ghost Boat?

04:06.620 --> 04:08.620
Or was it Boat Ghost?

04:08.620 --> 04:14.940
No, it was Ghost Boat, because a Boat Ghost is a dead boat. Yeah, sure. There was a place called

04:15.860 --> 04:23.340
Cinchilladas, not making that up. Not BS, that's true. I can curse on this one, I forgot. Shit, shit, shit.

04:23.340 --> 04:30.140
Yeah, this is, it's funny, because the people who were in the car, Travis and I were up front, navigating and driving, and

04:30.940 --> 04:36.740
the people who were in the car, who were not us, when we got off of this exit, the baby had to

04:37.380 --> 04:40.820
eat. The baby had to nurse. We had to stop. Babies. Babies.

04:41.580 --> 04:47.980
So Sydney says, we, whenever you guys could find a stop, and I looked like a

04:47.980 --> 04:55.100
heroic dad, because we pulled off almost instantly. Because it was seconds after seeing the Wizard Quest billboard.

04:55.100 --> 04:58.140
Well, you were praying, Jesus God, somebody need anything.

05:00.860 --> 05:07.660
So, yeah, we pull in, and everyone in the car who's not us is like, wow, can you believe we just pulled into a

05:08.980 --> 05:13.500
stop? Justin is saying, not even a wizard, just like, so de voce, just like, just keep going.

05:13.500 --> 05:18.620
Just, it's a mile. Wizard Quest is one mile off the road.

05:18.620 --> 05:22.020
And we weren't even gonna stop, we just wanted to pass it.

05:22.020 --> 05:28.180
Yeah, we just wanted to drive past Wizard Quest, and we also did pass by the Paul Munyon lumberjack show.

05:28.180 --> 05:31.180
It was, listen, the whole place looked like a fever dream.

05:32.660 --> 05:37.940
There was a building that had on top of it, an octopus fighting a King Kong.

05:37.940 --> 05:45.420
With no sign as to what the building was, like, you're gonna go, oh, yeah.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.420
It was actually, it was an Applebee's.

05:48.100 --> 05:51.700
It was like a fucked up Lovecraftian Applebee's.

05:51.700 --> 05:55.140
I'm gonna break open this local brew real quick.

05:55.220 --> 06:03.140
The hardest, the hardest thing to process about the Wisconsin Dell is I saw maybe 30 people in about two hours who I

06:03.140 --> 06:09.260
hand on a Bible would swear the thought going through their head was, I'm having a fun day.

06:11.820 --> 06:17.340
While at the gift shop, I bought my wife a magnet, and it said, this is just the Wisconsin Dell episode, huh?

06:17.580 --> 06:19.460
The magnet said,

06:19.460 --> 06:21.460
good girls go to heaven,

06:21.540 --> 06:23.540
bad girls go shopping,

06:24.220 --> 06:26.220
Wisconsin Dells.

06:26.220 --> 06:33.540
I thought this was ironic and funny. I thought bad girls want to buy fudge because that's what they have for sale.

06:33.540 --> 06:37.060
So I bought it, and I brought it to my wife like this,

06:38.900 --> 06:41.180
and I had to return it.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.700
And you'll never imagine,

06:44.700 --> 06:52.180
I wish I could have taken a snapshot as the poor 18 year old shop girl's face at the

06:52.180 --> 06:59.260
Wisconsin Dells gift shop. As I said, as I said the sentence, my wife didn't think this was as funny as I did.

07:00.580 --> 07:06.220
Can I exchange? This joke magnet, apparently I got the joke already. It's all used up.

07:07.300 --> 07:14.460
A new joke, please. Can I exchange this $3.50 magnet for a different $3.50 magnet?

07:14.460 --> 07:19.860
You can't just read them in the store. Like, hey, get out of here. You're using all the jokes up.

07:19.860 --> 07:26.820
After you said my wife didn't think this is funny as I was, did you, did she point up and you noticed that that is

07:26.820 --> 07:28.820
in fact the name of the store?

07:29.500 --> 07:32.380
The only thing that comforted me was I just kept telling myself,

07:32.380 --> 07:38.180
I can't be the first person to say this sentence in this store. Like, yeah, I get it.

07:38.180 --> 07:43.340
I get it. We've all been there. Even though your wife didn't, I get it. Because another themed magnet

07:43.340 --> 07:47.300
they had was a sandal themed, we're in the middle of Wisconsin.

07:47.300 --> 07:52.740
I wish you had just bought all the fucking magnets and then we could have some jokes in this episode of our comedy podcast.

07:53.780 --> 07:59.660
Jesus, please. We're on a goddamn Prairie Home Companion tear, Wisconsin Dells edition.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.980
Take that, Garrison Keillor.

08:03.740 --> 08:06.300
Even Garrison Keillor at this point would be like, fucking wrap it up.

08:07.460 --> 08:11.420
Come on. You are being very long-winded, I said for the first time on the show.

08:11.420 --> 08:13.820
Who has listened to our show before?

08:13.820 --> 08:15.820
We haven't even fucking introduced ourselves.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.740
Thank you. Thank you. Wait, no, wait.

08:17.740 --> 08:21.260
We could be anybody though, because we haven't said our names. The name of the podcast.

08:21.260 --> 08:26.020
This is my brother, my brother, me, an advice show from the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

08:26.020 --> 08:31.100
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your baby-est brother, Griffin McElroy, the fucking

08:32.180 --> 08:38.860
conductor of this orchestra, apparently. You remember? Like, people asked us questions and we're like, yeah, dicks.

08:38.860 --> 08:45.260
That's a typical breakdown of our show. There's an A block, a B block, there's a denouement.

08:45.580 --> 08:48.140
We don't talk about Wisconsin Dells for a half-fucking-hour.

08:48.860 --> 08:53.180
Who hasn't listened to our show before? It's alright, just raise your hands.

08:53.860 --> 08:59.140
Nobody's gonna not, nobody's never listened to our show before and also isn't at the Badgers game right now.

08:59.140 --> 09:04.500
Yeah, who here decided to go to the Badgers game instead of the my brother, my brother, me show trick question? Yeah.

09:04.500 --> 09:09.700
Tricks on you, though, because that money still spins. Thanks, suckers. Go ahead, Justin.

09:10.060 --> 09:16.320
So what we do is we take questions from people and we give them advice. We turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

09:16.740 --> 09:22.700
And we're gonna do that for you right now. I have some questions here. Well, I have some questions on my laptop. That's upstairs.

09:22.700 --> 09:27.940
I can't fucking believe you did that. Let it go. Now I have questions on Travis's phone.

09:27.940 --> 09:31.300
I hope I don't get embarrassing texts

09:31.300 --> 09:33.300
from my wife.

09:33.300 --> 09:40.660
I still don't think, I still don't think that magnet is funny, sincerely, Teresa.

09:42.660 --> 09:48.060
We, okay. Oh, I just got it. I just got it. And there's a picture of her laughing here.

09:49.260 --> 09:51.260
Or screaming. She's one of the two.

09:51.620 --> 09:56.580
Question, question, question. We are at that age where a lot of our friends are having kids.

09:56.580 --> 10:02.600
We ourselves are not planning on having our own children, but we like to make our house welcoming to parents and entertaining to kids.

10:02.600 --> 10:07.280
So we can continue to host parties and keep our relationship with our new parent friends. Any advice for

10:07.660 --> 10:13.420
awesome games and activities to keep around for the kiddos, as well as conveniences that'll make our friends more comfortable.

10:13.420 --> 10:16.440
That's from not the mama in Minneapolis.

10:16.940 --> 10:21.300
Nice. Except tonight when we're in Milwaukee. You here? Hi.

10:21.300 --> 10:27.580
You know, we did a show in Minneapolis last night. Can I just say, you're a saint.

10:27.900 --> 10:34.740
Yeah, that's really cool of you. I don't have a child, but my friends and brother that does, it sucks.

10:35.540 --> 10:36.700
Whoa.

10:36.700 --> 10:41.580
Kind of a cool thing to say. No, no, no. I mean if you're them. I mean if you're them. Not, no, not me.

10:41.580 --> 10:47.300
I love babies. It sucks to have an infant daughter. She's the light of my life.

10:47.300 --> 10:53.800
Real buzzkill. Okay. Yeah, all right. Have you tried showing her the room? She doesn't get it.

10:55.220 --> 11:01.620
She's like this isn't funny. I don't. Hey, uncle Travis, this magnet sucks.

11:02.900 --> 11:07.380
You're an idiot. I hate you. Oh, wait, where did the magnet go? It's gone forever.

11:08.420 --> 11:13.780
What a sweet reality that would be. Every time that magnet left your field of view, it was dead.

11:13.780 --> 11:18.820
You guys have been hanging out with my baby for the past three days.

11:19.020 --> 11:25.340
What, if you were to, when you're gonna go home and prepare an area in your home that's specifically for my child,

11:25.340 --> 11:31.100
what steps will you take? Hall of mirrors. Yeah, that's true. Babies love that shit.

11:31.100 --> 11:31.940
Babies do love them shits.

11:31.940 --> 11:32.460
Yeah.

11:32.460 --> 11:38.180
Especially if they're different sizes and different heights and you can be like, this is you baby. If you were like your normal size,

11:38.180 --> 11:40.180
this is you eight feet tall. They're like, what the fuck?

11:40.180 --> 11:44.340
You gotta get them high first. Yeah, super duper high.

11:46.060 --> 11:51.820
Keep some kind butt around for babies. How about a... I got you some strained weed.

11:52.340 --> 11:54.340
It's from the earth, baby.

11:56.220 --> 12:00.420
Don't be a prude, baby. They eat Cheerios the same way as stone people.

12:01.260 --> 12:03.100
Yeah, my ba...

12:03.100 --> 12:09.060
That's actually true. My baby just started eating these little cheesy poops called little crunchies.

12:09.060 --> 12:14.060
She looks exactly... Holy shit, it's the funniest thing in the universe. She looks exactly like David Hasselhoff in that hamburger video.

12:16.740 --> 12:23.420
Sometimes it'll get stuck to her forehead and like, where'd it go? I don't know, I moved on. Much, much like the Hoff,

12:24.620 --> 12:27.100
she just sort of... Friend of the show. Friend of the show, the Hoff,

12:27.180 --> 12:31.620
she just sort of puts material in her mouth and waits for it to dissolve like a goddamn Venus flytrap.

12:32.620 --> 12:35.980
She's a miracle. She's a miracle and she's your everything.

12:35.980 --> 12:38.900
I would do like you just like a room

12:39.060 --> 12:45.500
that's just like a like a baby pool with like like six inches of just standing water in it.

12:46.100 --> 12:53.060
Because there's just... There's just a constant seepage, just a constant fluid slime.

12:53.060 --> 12:55.140
There's just a fucking constant discharge.

12:55.140 --> 13:01.100
It's just a good old-fashioned baby soaking. Or for humans too, because it's like this is my nice Oxford.

13:01.100 --> 13:07.340
Thank you for the gift. You're Justin's everything and I adore you too, but I need a room that I could just like lay down in

13:07.340 --> 13:09.340
and be clean. That is a good question.

13:09.580 --> 13:17.100
Justin, as a father, have you started to alter your wardrobe away from your nice Oxfords to maybe some shittier shirts?

13:17.580 --> 13:19.580
Yeah, Justin, from your fucking...

13:21.580 --> 13:25.260
I am... From your Nordstrom's finest to...

13:25.260 --> 13:33.100
You go from the Margaritaville collared shirt to just a Tybee Island v-neck.

13:33.100 --> 13:38.060
See, Griffin got mean, so I was gonna say maybe a room of smocks.

13:38.540 --> 13:43.300
We were checking out of our hotel this morning in Minneapolis before the drive.

13:43.420 --> 13:46.340
God, I wish this story took place in the Dells.

13:48.460 --> 13:53.220
And right before we were about to leave, my infant daughter was

13:53.220 --> 13:59.500
naked, because I was changing her, and I stood her up to look at her and just observe her majesty, and she...

14:00.700 --> 14:05.700
A giant pee right on the bed of the hotel.

14:05.700 --> 14:11.620
And at first I was like, eh. And then I was like, that's the most rock and roll thing I've ever seen.

14:12.700 --> 14:15.700
You're like Axl Rose the baby.

14:15.700 --> 14:19.700
It's the only rock and roll thing that has happened to us on this fucking tour so far.

14:19.700 --> 14:23.700
That's true. You and I have had drooling nosebleeds.

14:23.700 --> 14:28.700
Travis and I have had four nosebleeds today between the two of us, and it's our second day of the tour!

14:28.700 --> 14:30.700
The second of three days!

14:30.700 --> 14:34.700
It was so rock and roll that my brain went, wait, two days?

14:34.700 --> 14:37.700
No way. The road's tough, man. We're not made for the road.

14:37.700 --> 14:39.700
How about a Yahoo answer?

14:39.700 --> 14:41.700
Yes.

14:42.700 --> 14:45.700
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Dave Page. Thank you, Dave.

14:45.700 --> 14:50.700
This was sent in by Yahoo Answers user Mary. 0% best answers. Better luck next time.

14:51.700 --> 14:57.700
Mary asks, found a Chex in a new candle.

15:00.700 --> 15:04.700
I bought a candle from Goodwill that came from Target. It was brand new.

15:04.700 --> 15:08.700
Never been lit. Not even scratches.

15:08.700 --> 15:16.700
But after two nights of lighting, I saw something in the middle, so I dug it out, and it was a Chex cereal piece.

15:16.700 --> 15:21.700
How did that happen? Was someone eating Chex mix while making candles?

15:21.700 --> 15:25.700
Does anyone know? Should I ask Target?

15:25.700 --> 15:30.700
I'd post a pic of the candle too, but I can only do one photo.

15:30.700 --> 15:35.700
And then fucking sure enough, there's a Chex.

15:35.700 --> 15:40.700
It's got a little bit of burn on it. It's been caramelized a tad.

15:40.700 --> 15:43.700
That's a fucking Chex dug out of candle.

15:43.700 --> 15:46.700
There's so much to unpack here. Two quick things.

15:46.700 --> 15:50.700
One, is the singular Chex? Is it a Chex?

15:50.700 --> 15:54.700
I saw a Chex. I saw a Chex. I saw a Chex.

15:54.700 --> 15:58.700
I think it's a Cheese. I saw a Chex.

15:58.700 --> 16:06.700
The other thing, I don't think Target provides support for candles you bought at Goodwill after someone bought them at Target.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.700
Hold on, hold on. Let's do that call. Justin, call me.

16:09.700 --> 16:10.700
Bring, bring.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.700
Hi. Yes, hello, Target.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.700
Hi, it's me. A real piece of shit.

16:14.700 --> 16:17.700
Uh-huh. Go on.

16:17.700 --> 16:23.700
I was about to post a question that I would answer, but I wanted you guys to get a chance to set this right first.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.700
Yes, of course, of course. How can I help you?

16:25.700 --> 16:28.700
I bought a candle at Goodwill that someone bought at Target first.

16:28.700 --> 16:33.700
Uh-huh. Well, let me say, I was trained exactly for this. Let me do everything I can to help you.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.700
What is the issue you're dealing with?

16:35.700 --> 16:36.700
There's a Chex in it.

16:36.700 --> 16:37.700
Oh, not again.

16:37.700 --> 16:38.700
Again.

16:38.700 --> 16:43.700
I got to talk to Chexy Steve down on the assembly line.

16:43.700 --> 16:45.700
I'm bored.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.700
That wasn't a character. I'm just bored over here.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.700
You didn't give me a bit.

16:50.700 --> 16:54.700
What if you called in and you cost Chexy Steve his job?

16:54.700 --> 16:55.700
Yeah.

16:55.700 --> 17:02.700
Yeah, listen, somebody who's eating Chex on the assembly line as they make Target candles doesn't have a long way to fall.

17:02.700 --> 17:04.700
I have low blood sugar. You know that.

17:04.700 --> 17:05.700
You know that.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.700
I have to eat Chex or I'll die.

17:07.700 --> 17:08.700
Okay, but imagine-

17:08.700 --> 17:11.700
It could have been Karen, Trisket Karen.

17:11.700 --> 17:22.700
Your Chex mixed Steve, and you're fucking grooving over the assembly line, over the cauldron, I guess, and a single piece of Chex.

17:22.700 --> 17:30.700
Let's just say Melba Toast because it's easier to singularize, but a single piece of Melba Toast falls out of your mouth and into the machine.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.700
You're not going to be like, stop, stop the whole-

17:32.700 --> 17:33.700
Stop the process.

17:33.700 --> 17:38.700
Every fucking second that machine is stopped, that company is losing billions of dollars.

17:38.700 --> 17:48.700
Do you guys think that maybe it was just a candle wick and this person's mother has been giving them candle wicks their whole life and calling them Chex?

17:48.700 --> 17:51.700
You want a snack?

17:51.700 --> 17:53.700
Have some Chex.

17:53.700 --> 17:54.700
Chex?

17:54.700 --> 17:55.700
Don't tell him.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.700
Don't tell him.

17:56.700 --> 18:03.700
Please, things are hard enough. Let Charlie Bucket have this one last dream where he's eating Chex.

18:03.700 --> 18:08.700
Cheer up, Charlie. Have some waxy poops.

18:08.700 --> 18:12.700
Well, you read a human being question now.

18:12.700 --> 18:18.700
Here's one from a human about a month ago.

18:18.700 --> 18:19.700
Is this okay?

18:19.700 --> 18:20.700
You're doing great.

18:20.700 --> 18:21.700
All right.

18:21.700 --> 18:25.700
I know how my phone likes it.

18:25.700 --> 18:29.700
About a month ago, we hired a dog walker for the first time.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.700
The day after he-

18:31.700 --> 18:32.700
Is this yours?

18:32.700 --> 18:33.700
This is right up your alley.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.700
You're laughing at your own brand, huh? You're a big fan.

18:35.700 --> 18:36.700
Oh, yeah, this next-

18:36.700 --> 18:37.700
Guys, this next-

18:37.700 --> 18:38.700
Yeah.

18:38.700 --> 18:39.700
Oh, shit.

18:39.700 --> 18:40.700
Shut up.

18:40.700 --> 18:41.700
Shut up.

18:41.700 --> 18:42.700
Listen, you're going to love this shit.

18:42.700 --> 18:43.700
Check it.

18:43.700 --> 18:49.700
Yeah, guys, there's nothing I hate more than people who laugh at themselves.

18:49.700 --> 18:52.700
About a month ago, we hired a dog walker for the first time.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.700
Can I get some more of that booze while I'm reading this? Thanks.

18:55.700 --> 18:56.700
What is this, by the way?

18:56.700 --> 19:00.700
This is repeal reserve rye, extremely limited.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.700
Somebody gave this to us in the crowd.

19:02.700 --> 19:03.700
It's amazing.

19:03.700 --> 19:04.700
It's wonderful.

19:04.700 --> 19:05.700
Thank you, whoever you are.

19:05.700 --> 19:06.700
It's really good.

19:06.700 --> 19:09.700
I feel bad about mixing it with Diet Werners, but them's the breaks in the road.

19:09.700 --> 19:12.700
Diet Werners is the best ginger ale in the universe.

19:12.700 --> 19:16.700
We were also given a bunch of Werners. Is Mr. Werners here tonight?

19:16.700 --> 19:18.700
Mr. Werners? Vernon Werners? Are you here?

19:18.700 --> 19:22.700
About a month ago, we hired – put some Werners in there, too.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.700
You got to cut that bad boy, okay?

19:24.700 --> 19:27.700
About a month ago, we hired a dog walker for the first time.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.700
Have you guys gotten that part? Cool.

19:29.700 --> 19:35.700
The day after he walked our dog, my wife and I found a sweatshirt in the interway that belonged to the walker.

19:35.700 --> 19:42.700
While we intended to email the dog walking company, we had forgotten to do so until recently rediscovering the sweatshirt.

19:42.700 --> 19:46.700
It's been a month, and we don't plan on using the service again.

19:46.700 --> 19:52.700
What do we do, brother? Send off an email a month after the fact? Donate it? Throw it away? Keep it?

19:52.700 --> 19:57.700
As from charity, combust or conversion? You are here, correct?

19:57.700 --> 20:00.700
Hey, how's it going? Are you wearing the sweatshirt now?

20:00.700 --> 20:04.700
That would have been a nice touch. That would have really committed to the bit.

20:04.700 --> 20:07.700
I have two questions. Thank you, Scraps, by the way.

20:07.700 --> 20:10.700
Question one for the drink. You're welcome.

20:10.700 --> 20:18.700
Question one. When you say, we intended to send the email, did you? Did you?

20:18.700 --> 20:24.700
You know how they work, right? Because, hey, he left a sweatshirt.

20:24.700 --> 20:26.700
Ten seconds.

20:26.700 --> 20:31.700
Second question. What did he do that you didn't bring him back?

20:31.700 --> 20:34.700
He walked the dog counterclockwise.

20:34.700 --> 20:42.700
Is this fucking sweatshirt? Were there, like, letters from the war in the pockets?

20:42.700 --> 20:45.700
Wait, why does that change things?

20:45.700 --> 20:47.700
It's a sweatshirt!

20:47.700 --> 20:56.700
If somebody I paid to do a service for me leaves a sweatshirt in my house, it's not mine, but it's not theirs anymore.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.700
Wait, hold on.

20:58.700 --> 21:03.700
What if it's weighted down with emotions? Like, that was the sweatshirt I wore when I saw Death Cab for Cutie.

21:03.700 --> 21:08.700
If the weight is provided... Yes, that was an emotional concert for me.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.700
I lived, I learned, I grew.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.700
Can we break the word down for a second?

21:13.700 --> 21:22.700
Like, if you are wearing something called a sweatshirt and you have any expectation that someone's gonna, like, keep it in a cubby in their home...

21:22.700 --> 21:26.700
Where are my piss pants? Oh, I left them at my job again.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.700
These are my good shit khakis.

21:29.700 --> 21:35.700
A sentence no one should ever say. That's my finest sweatshirt.

21:35.700 --> 21:40.700
I left my jizz bandana at their house. Not again.

21:40.700 --> 21:44.700
Wait, hold on. What circumstance would they have their jizz bandana out of their house?

21:44.700 --> 21:48.700
We hired a dog walker. We will never hire him again.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.700
It's a tough job.

21:51.700 --> 21:57.700
Listen, walking a dog is stressful, and sometimes you gotta rub one out.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.700
While headbanging, I guess.

21:59.700 --> 22:03.700
Dog, I'll take you out in five minutes. Give me a second.

22:03.700 --> 22:09.700
You ever see the back of that Bruce Springsteen album? That's what it was. It was a jizz bandana.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.700
Oh, Jesus.

22:11.700 --> 22:16.700
Recently, a new neighbor moved in across the street from my wife and me.

22:16.700 --> 22:19.700
My wife took her cookies, and I was building a grill.

22:19.700 --> 22:22.700
No, took her cookies. Not took her cookies.

22:22.700 --> 22:30.700
Welcome to the neighborhood, bitch. Why?

22:30.700 --> 22:36.700
My wife took her cookies until she'd eaten enough salad.

22:36.700 --> 22:42.700
By the way, quick update. Justin ate some field greens for dinner. I watched him. I was so fucking proud of him.

22:42.700 --> 22:45.700
He also made up the term field greens.

22:45.700 --> 22:48.700
No, that's a thing.

22:48.700 --> 22:52.700
Field of greens, the movie Field of Greens. Now, hold on.

22:52.700 --> 22:57.700
Before you go any further, I talked about this on Sawbones. Thank you for listening.

22:57.700 --> 23:03.700
Recently, my new neighbor moved in across the street from... I shouldn't say that. He was caring for my infant.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.700
Were we supposed to be doing that?

23:05.700 --> 23:09.700
We're gonna get through this question if it's the last thing we do, everybody.

23:09.700 --> 23:12.700
Do you guys get the part about the new neighbor? Excellent.

23:12.700 --> 23:18.700
I moved in across from my wife, and the wife stole some cookies, and I was building a grill, so I waved from our garage.

23:18.700 --> 23:22.700
Later that week, my wife and I were walking to the bus, and the woman joined us.

23:22.700 --> 23:27.700
She asked my wife if I was her son.

23:27.700 --> 23:32.700
After a few seconds of awkward silence, my wife said, no, this is my husband.

23:32.700 --> 23:39.700
Who should be more offended? Me, who apparently looks like a 12-year-old despite being 31, over six feet tall, and going gray?

23:39.700 --> 23:45.700
Or my wife, who the woman thought must look older than her 30 years.

23:45.700 --> 23:49.700
That's from Mifft and Madison. I have a confession to make.

23:49.700 --> 23:53.700
Yeah! Honestly!

23:53.700 --> 23:56.700
Sorry, we didn't ask... Sorry, that was our fault.

23:56.700 --> 24:01.700
We didn't ask if the person who asked that was in the audience, and so you felt the need to let us know.

24:01.700 --> 24:05.700
Well, what if they don't know it's me? I should say something.

24:05.700 --> 24:09.700
Let me say, that was not a 12-year-old's howl.

24:09.700 --> 24:16.700
When we were going through the questions to talk about during dinner, and I was pretty deeply into my big CD...

24:16.700 --> 24:17.700
Pull back that curtain.

24:17.700 --> 24:19.700
I'm pulling back the curtain.

24:19.700 --> 24:25.700
I heard the line, she asked my wife if I was her son,

24:25.700 --> 24:35.700
and what I interpreted it as was the older woman asking if the question asker was her son,

24:35.700 --> 24:44.700
and I couldn't think for fucking five minutes. I was like, who are these monsters that I call brothers

24:44.700 --> 24:49.700
who are making fun of this clearly Alzheimer's stricken woman?

24:49.700 --> 24:53.700
No, because I want it to be like this. Excuse me.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.700
Is that my son?

24:56.700 --> 24:59.700
I don't mean to make this awkward, but...

24:59.700 --> 25:02.700
I think you got my boy.

25:02.700 --> 25:05.700
I see what happened here. You got my boy.

25:05.700 --> 25:08.700
He got my boy. I want him back.

25:08.700 --> 25:12.700
I need him to do chores and such.

25:12.700 --> 25:17.700
The reason... I was just sitting up here thinking about this.

25:17.700 --> 25:21.700
Sometimes I wish we did music, because I feel like if you're Bon Jovi,

25:21.700 --> 25:24.700
you can look into the crowd and make eye contact with people,

25:24.700 --> 25:26.700
and it's like a real, real moment for them.

25:26.700 --> 25:29.700
For doing a comedy podcast, it's just really distracting,

25:29.700 --> 25:32.700
because they're not going to mouth the words to jokes for you.

25:32.700 --> 25:34.700
Oh, you don't get to do this move?

25:34.700 --> 25:37.700
Yeah, right. What's the next thing I'm going to say?

25:37.700 --> 25:40.700
It's probably dicks or horses or something.

25:40.700 --> 25:42.700
Dick horses. Now you...

25:42.700 --> 25:44.700
I think somebody actually yelled dick horses.

25:44.700 --> 25:46.700
So who should be more offended?

25:46.700 --> 25:48.700
Good work, I guess. Well done.

25:48.700 --> 25:52.700
Here's the thing. The person who is the most awesome in this situation

25:52.700 --> 25:54.700
is the older woman neighbor.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.700
Yeah, she is. Are you kidding me?

25:56.700 --> 25:58.700
I can't imagine a scenario...

25:58.700 --> 26:02.700
I'm a 31-year-old adult person.

26:02.700 --> 26:07.700
I can't imagine being that blunt and honest ever

26:07.700 --> 26:10.700
to go, hey, fucking stop.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.700
Is that your son?

26:12.700 --> 26:14.700
Ever.

26:14.700 --> 26:17.700
I would do this like, how long? What's up?

26:17.700 --> 26:22.700
What is the riskiest, potentially wrongest fucking thing I can say?

26:22.700 --> 26:25.700
Because if it breaks bad, never again.

26:25.700 --> 26:29.700
Never again. You will never steal this woman's cookies ever again.

26:29.700 --> 26:31.700
Maybe that's a countermeasure.

26:31.700 --> 26:33.700
Maybe they were shit cookies.

26:33.700 --> 26:36.700
Listen, I'm not trying to knock. Are you here?

26:36.700 --> 26:39.700
That was a very beaten down yeah.

26:39.700 --> 26:41.700
I'm so sorry if we've been cruel.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.700
When your husband had his interaction with her,

26:44.700 --> 26:47.700
was she like, what are you doing?

26:47.700 --> 26:50.700
And he was like, I'm making a grill.

26:50.700 --> 26:52.700
Like that and wave like a 12-year-old.

26:52.700 --> 26:54.700
I'm working in my garage.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.700
I'm going to cook a steak on it.

26:56.700 --> 26:59.700
I'm going to cook a steak on it later.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.700
I'm making a steak.

27:01.700 --> 27:04.700
I don't know how weathers work.

27:04.700 --> 27:07.700
How do you spell steak?

27:07.700 --> 27:11.700
I'm watching Breaking Bad.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.700
Sorry to interrupt you guys, us.

27:14.700 --> 27:18.700
But I want to take a quick moment to tell you about our sponsors for this episode.

27:18.700 --> 27:21.700
First up is a returning favorite, Warby Parker.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.700
Remember Warby Parker?

27:23.700 --> 27:26.700
For fashion forward prescription glasses that start at just 95 bucks.

27:26.700 --> 27:30.700
That sounds cool and that's a great price, but it gets better.

27:30.700 --> 27:32.700
They have this home try-on program.

27:32.700 --> 27:34.700
I just turned into Greg Brady for a second.

27:34.700 --> 27:36.700
Or Peter Brady. I didn't watch the Brady Bunch.

27:36.700 --> 27:38.700
I don't know. Fuck you.

27:38.700 --> 27:41.700
You can order five pairs of glasses to be shipped directly to your home.

27:41.700 --> 27:48.700
You try them on and then you select the ones you want and send them back free with no obligation to purchase.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.700
I wish you turned into Wayne Brady.

27:50.700 --> 27:51.700
Okay.

27:51.700 --> 27:54.700
You get the five, you like two of them, you send three back.

27:54.700 --> 27:55.700
Done.

27:55.700 --> 27:59.700
You yell at the glasses you don't like and you put them in a box, a dark box.

27:59.700 --> 28:03.700
You tie them to a balloon and they float up in the air and then Warby Parker collects them in the clouds.

28:03.700 --> 28:05.700
That's true because they're angels.

28:05.700 --> 28:09.700
They're cloud-based glasses and you can get them at warbyparker.com slash my brother.

28:09.700 --> 28:13.700
And if you do that, you get free three-day shipping on your final frame choice.

28:13.700 --> 28:17.700
That address again is warbyparker.com slash my brother.

28:17.700 --> 28:19.700
Also sponsoring us this week, Nature Box.

28:19.700 --> 28:21.700
You know them. You love them.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.700
One of our favorites.

28:22.700 --> 28:27.700
I guess if this is your first time hearing, first of all, it's probably weird to listen to a live show first.

28:27.700 --> 28:31.700
But zero artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners.

28:31.700 --> 28:32.700
Zero grams trans fat.

28:32.700 --> 28:34.700
No high fructose corn syrup.

28:34.700 --> 28:35.700
This is like good shit.

28:35.700 --> 28:36.700
Sup?

28:36.700 --> 28:37.700
Sorry what, Travis? Sorry?

28:37.700 --> 28:40.700
No high fructose corn syrup.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.700
This is only the good shit.

28:42.700 --> 28:47.700
If any of the words I'm about to say to you sound amazing, you'll want to get down on this.

28:47.700 --> 28:48.700
Sriracha roasted cashews.

28:48.700 --> 28:51.700
I'm jamming on the Asiago cheese crisps right now.

28:51.700 --> 28:52.700
Oh, god damn.

28:52.700 --> 28:55.700
They're like the greatest savory snack I've ever had.

28:55.700 --> 28:57.700
I'm way into parmesan pot pops.

28:57.700 --> 29:00.700
You two motherfuckers are living under the Tuscan sun.

29:00.700 --> 29:01.700
That's me.

29:01.700 --> 29:03.700
Diane Lane up in this bitch.

29:03.700 --> 29:07.700
These great snacks are available to you at naturebox.com slash my brother.

29:07.700 --> 29:12.700
If you go there, you can get a free sampler box of great tasting healthy snacks.

29:12.700 --> 29:15.700
That address again, naturebox.com slash my brother.

29:15.700 --> 29:16.700
Go get some snacks.

29:16.700 --> 29:17.700
They're great tasting.

29:17.700 --> 29:18.700
They're healthy.

29:18.700 --> 29:19.700
They're delicious.

29:19.700 --> 29:20.700
Go get them.

29:20.700 --> 29:23.700
As long as you're feeling hungry, I got another sponsor here to tell you about.

29:23.700 --> 29:24.700
It's called Blue Apron.

29:24.700 --> 29:28.700
Blue Apron is a service that sends you ingredients and it's like a puzzle.

29:28.700 --> 29:33.700
When you put the ingredients together with the right steps and in the right measurements,

29:33.700 --> 29:36.700
then you have created a delicious food stuff all by yourself.

29:36.700 --> 29:38.700
You get to feel like a big adult and then you get to eat a big yummy meal.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.700
You also figured out who killed JFK.

29:40.700 --> 29:46.700
We're looking at almond crusted cod with blistered sugar snappy salad,

29:46.700 --> 29:50.700
spring ramen ground pork with garlic chives.

29:50.700 --> 29:51.700
God damn.

29:51.700 --> 29:52.700
Yeah.

29:52.700 --> 29:56.700
Spinach casserole, egg noodles, spinach, orange.

29:56.700 --> 29:57.700
Oh my god.

29:57.700 --> 29:59.700
Travis doesn't even know some of these words.

29:59.700 --> 30:00.700
Spinach.

30:00.700 --> 30:04.700
Peery, peery chicken thighs with coconut plantain mash and collard greens.

30:04.700 --> 30:05.700
Blue Apron's great.

30:05.700 --> 30:06.700
The meals are balanced.

30:06.700 --> 30:11.700
They're like five to 700 calories per serving and they're very, they're generously portioned

30:11.700 --> 30:14.700
so that you get a lot of food for your money and your calories.

30:14.700 --> 30:17.700
Speaking of generous, here's two free meals for you.

30:17.700 --> 30:19.700
Go to blueapron.com slash my brother.

30:19.700 --> 30:21.700
We just fed you twice.

30:21.700 --> 30:24.700
We just gave you two free meals from blueapron.com.

30:24.700 --> 30:25.700
Teach a listener to fish.

30:25.700 --> 30:26.700
Yeah.

30:26.700 --> 30:27.700
They'll eat for a day.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.700
Teach a listener to get blue apron.

30:29.700 --> 30:33.700
They'll get two free meals and then pay under less than $10 for the following meals.

30:33.700 --> 30:37.700
Teach a listener to fish and he'll eat for a day and then get bored with fishing and move

30:37.700 --> 30:40.700
on to the next day and be like, wait, oh shit, I should have kept doing that.

30:40.700 --> 30:41.700
I'm so, so hungry.

30:41.700 --> 30:42.700
I'm so hungry.

30:42.700 --> 30:45.700
I got a message for Andre Schenk here from Isaac Beachy.

30:45.700 --> 30:48.700
He says, hey Andre Schenk, it's Isaac.

30:48.700 --> 30:49.700
This is crazy, right?

30:49.700 --> 30:51.700
I can get Griffin to say whatever I want.

30:51.700 --> 30:52.700
No, you can't.

30:52.700 --> 30:53.700
You can't because I'm reading it.

30:53.700 --> 30:55.700
You can't buy me nothing.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.700
I'm drunk on Griffin.

30:57.700 --> 30:59.700
I'm sorry.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.700
I'm drunk on syrup.

31:01.700 --> 31:02.700
I'm drunk on power.

31:02.700 --> 31:03.700
I'm Griffin.

31:03.700 --> 31:06.700
I'm a little baby, a little baby that poops.

31:06.700 --> 31:07.700
This is me.

31:07.700 --> 31:10.700
You can't see me right now, but I'm fucking matrix dodging in front of my microphone like,

31:10.700 --> 31:12.700
no, no, you don't know.

31:12.700 --> 31:13.700
I'm pooping my pants right now.

31:13.700 --> 31:15.700
Poop, poop, poop all over my pants.

31:15.700 --> 31:16.700
I think Rush Limbaugh is the greatest.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.700
I don't believe in global warming yet.

31:18.700 --> 31:19.700
Griffin didn't say that I did.

31:19.700 --> 31:23.700
But it's a shame because I all of that stuff is totally true.

31:23.700 --> 31:26.700
Thank you, Andre.

31:26.700 --> 31:31.700
I guess Isaac didn't have a message for you.

31:31.700 --> 31:33.700
He just wanted to control me like some sort of meat puppet.

31:33.700 --> 31:34.700
Well, fuck that.

31:34.700 --> 31:35.700
I'm my own man.

31:35.700 --> 31:36.700
Let's do another message.

31:36.700 --> 31:39.700
This next one is a simple one, and it's a loving one.

31:39.700 --> 31:46.700
It's from a brother, Dan Fowler, to his sister, Victoria Fowler, and his simple message of

31:46.700 --> 31:49.700
love reads, Victoria smells like farts.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.700
Oh, shit.

31:51.700 --> 31:57.700
And then in what I would say one of the most gracious things anyone has ever said about

31:57.700 --> 32:00.700
us, Dan included in the message, that's it.

32:00.700 --> 32:02.700
Perhaps this is below you, gentlemen.

32:02.700 --> 32:03.700
Nope.

32:03.700 --> 32:04.700
Oh, man.

32:04.700 --> 32:06.700
It's not below us all, but Victoria, are you going to stand for that?

32:06.700 --> 32:07.700
You've got to stand up to him.

32:07.700 --> 32:09.700
Send us $100 to stand up for you.

32:09.700 --> 32:12.700
Let's start a flame war on the Jumbotron.

32:12.700 --> 32:18.700
Again, it is below me, and I didn't say it because I am starting to hold myself to a

32:18.700 --> 32:19.700
certain standard on this show.

32:19.700 --> 32:20.700
Okay.

32:20.700 --> 32:21.700
Here's the last message.

32:21.700 --> 32:29.700
It's for Dan Shriner, and it's from Jobo, who says, hey, Dan Shriner, happy birthday.

32:29.700 --> 32:33.700
This is a loving message from Jobo reaching out to you across space and time courtesy

32:33.700 --> 32:37.700
of a McElroy Brothers vocal cords and mouth movements.

32:37.700 --> 32:41.700
Never forget how awesome you are, and always remember how much your friends and family

32:41.700 --> 32:42.700
care about you.

32:42.700 --> 32:43.700
Nerd.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.700
My son.

32:45.700 --> 32:51.700
And he wanted that message to be sent on April 21st, which is a Tuesday, not typically the

32:51.700 --> 32:58.700
day that we transmit our love broadcasts to the world around us, but there it is, message

32:58.700 --> 32:59.700
deployed.

32:59.700 --> 33:03.700
I did it with – there's been a lot this week of people wanting to control our mouths,

33:03.700 --> 33:05.700
like we're some sort of Jim Henson monstrosity.

33:05.700 --> 33:06.700
Should we get back to the show?

33:06.700 --> 33:07.700
Yes.

33:07.700 --> 33:08.700
Let's do it.

33:08.700 --> 33:13.700
Here's another JaDrew from JaDrew user level 1000 Drew in Drew Davenport.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.700
Thank you, Drew.

33:15.700 --> 33:25.700
It's by JaDrewAnswersUserGuitarMan, who asks, I called a man Bumblefoot, and he was angered.

33:25.700 --> 33:31.700
Oh, man, this is going to take a few tries.

33:31.700 --> 33:32.700
Okay.

33:32.700 --> 33:34.700
Start again, because that's the best sentence I've ever –

33:34.700 --> 33:37.700
I'm not even through the fucking headline yet.

33:37.700 --> 33:41.700
I called a man Bumblefoot, and he was angered.

33:41.700 --> 33:43.700
I did it in a friendly way, though.

33:43.700 --> 33:46.700
Was I wrong to do this?

33:46.700 --> 33:50.700
We've all been there.

33:50.700 --> 33:52.700
Hey, Bumblefoot, excuse me.

33:52.700 --> 33:53.700
Sorry?

33:53.700 --> 34:00.700
Bumblefoot, that's our word.

34:00.700 --> 34:01.700
I got to go now.

34:01.700 --> 34:03.700
Good night, everyone.

34:03.700 --> 34:04.700
Travis out.

34:04.700 --> 34:07.700
30 minutes, and Travis has retired from the stage.

34:07.700 --> 34:10.700
There is a man I know named Ron who lives near me.

34:10.700 --> 34:16.700
I was hanging out in the front yard as my brother was cooking burgers on the gweel.

34:16.700 --> 34:22.700
Ron was walking his dog, and as he approached, I said, hello there, Bumblefoot.

34:22.700 --> 34:25.700
I would give anything if that's somebody's stepdad, Ron.

34:25.700 --> 34:27.700
Like, that guy hasn't gone through enough.

34:27.700 --> 34:30.700
Listen, man, I get it enough at home.

34:30.700 --> 34:32.700
Bumblefoot's already written on my dog.

34:32.700 --> 34:35.700
Leave me alone.

34:35.700 --> 34:39.700
He said, Bumblefoot, what does that mean?

34:39.700 --> 34:40.700
I am your elder.

34:40.700 --> 34:44.700
Have some respect.

34:44.700 --> 34:50.700
The funny part is that he is only my elder by about six years, as he is 45 and I am 39.

34:50.700 --> 34:57.700
Whoa!

34:57.700 --> 35:00.700
Okay, quick question.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.700
Hey there, Bumblefoot.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.700
Excuse me?

35:04.700 --> 35:05.700
What's sweeter?

35:05.700 --> 35:06.700
I'm a man.

35:06.700 --> 35:07.700
What's sweeter?

35:07.700 --> 35:10.700
I'm a Bumble man.

35:10.700 --> 35:13.700
I'm not a Bumble boy.

35:13.700 --> 35:17.700
You call me Bumble, sir.

35:17.700 --> 35:25.700
What's better, a 39-year-old person calling another 46-year-old person a Bumblefoot or

35:25.700 --> 35:30.700
a 39-year-old person doing that and saying, I have got to tell Yahoo Answers about this.

35:30.700 --> 35:33.700
You'll never believe what happened to me.

35:33.700 --> 35:37.700
Dear Yahoo Answers, I never believed it would happen to me.

35:37.700 --> 35:41.700
I've called so many people Bumblefoot and nothing has happened.

35:41.700 --> 35:44.700
This is the least sexy penthouse letter I've ever read.

35:44.700 --> 35:46.700
I meant for it to be a friendly nickname.

35:46.700 --> 35:48.700
Ron took it the wrong way.

35:48.700 --> 35:49.700
Was I wrong to do this?

35:49.700 --> 35:51.700
So he's been doing some fucking cool searching.

35:51.700 --> 35:54.700
Did you say, was I Ron to do this?

35:54.700 --> 35:56.700
One of two things has happened.

35:56.700 --> 35:57.700
Okay.

35:57.700 --> 36:02.700
Either he has seen Ron a thousand times and gone, uh, no.

36:02.700 --> 36:03.700
That's not it.

36:03.700 --> 36:04.700
No, I can't.

36:04.700 --> 36:05.700
What is it?

36:05.700 --> 36:06.700
Ramadama ding dong.

36:06.700 --> 36:07.700
Fuck.

36:07.700 --> 36:08.700
Hey.

36:08.700 --> 36:09.700
Oh, no, no.

36:09.700 --> 36:10.700
I'll get it.

36:10.700 --> 36:11.700
I'll get it.

36:11.700 --> 36:14.700
Or he's been trying out nicknames at Ron and Ron's just walking.

36:14.700 --> 36:20.700
And maybe when he, when Ron was like nine, he got stung by a bee on the foot and a kid

36:20.700 --> 36:22.700
was like, hey, look at Bumblefoot.

36:22.700 --> 36:24.700
And Ron was like, no, no.

36:24.700 --> 36:25.700
What?

36:25.700 --> 36:26.700
It's like, oh, Bumblefoot.

36:26.700 --> 36:28.700
And it haunted him through college.

36:28.700 --> 36:32.700
And like a girl would be about to go home with Ron and be like, are you going home with

36:32.700 --> 36:33.700
Bumblefoot?

36:33.700 --> 36:34.700
And he's like, what?

36:34.700 --> 36:35.700
No, no.

36:35.700 --> 36:36.700
That's Bumblefoot.

36:36.700 --> 36:41.700
Wait, this guy's Bumblefoot?

36:41.700 --> 36:42.700
No way.

36:42.700 --> 36:43.700
Sex canceled.

36:43.700 --> 36:46.700
Griffin, don't interrupt him.

36:46.700 --> 36:49.700
There has got to be more to this riff.

36:49.700 --> 36:56.700
I have got to get to the end of the vision quest that my brother is taking me on.

36:56.700 --> 37:01.700
I feel like I'm watching a whole John Cusack movie in my head.

37:01.700 --> 37:03.700
You have got to continue.

37:03.700 --> 37:06.700
So then Ron grew up to be Ron.

37:06.700 --> 37:09.700
He changed his last name to Perlman.

37:09.700 --> 37:12.700
He's been living his whole life as a movie star.

37:12.700 --> 37:14.700
He's grown outside the Bumblefoot name.

37:14.700 --> 37:17.700
He's made himself Ron Perlman.

37:17.700 --> 37:19.700
Ron Perlman, the 45 year old man.

37:19.700 --> 37:20.700
Sure.

37:20.700 --> 37:22.700
He hasn't held up well.

37:22.700 --> 37:23.700
I guess.

37:23.700 --> 37:27.700
It's all the goddamn bee stings.

37:27.700 --> 37:29.700
Did you just call me Bumblefoot?

37:29.700 --> 37:32.700
I was in Pacific Rim.

37:32.700 --> 37:33.700
Oh, God.

37:33.700 --> 37:35.700
It got really sad there at the end.

37:35.700 --> 37:39.700
I didn't think you could make me care about Bumblefoot, but you goddamn did.

37:39.700 --> 37:42.700
You're a real weaver of stories, Travis.

37:42.700 --> 37:45.700
I actually have that written in my notebook upstairs.

37:45.700 --> 37:48.700
It's on my computer too.

37:48.700 --> 37:53.700
You're the Dean Koontz of podcast refs.

37:53.700 --> 37:55.700
What do you guys want to do?

37:55.700 --> 37:58.700
Let's do one other question and then throw it to the house.

37:58.700 --> 38:00.700
You want a real human question?

38:00.700 --> 38:04.700
Yeah, let's do a real one.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.700
My friend and I have...

38:06.700 --> 38:07.700
This is good.

38:07.700 --> 38:08.700
My friend and I...

38:08.700 --> 38:11.700
Although it's weird if they're here, but I'm going to go for it anyway.

38:11.700 --> 38:12.700
Oh, shit.

38:12.700 --> 38:13.700
I didn't even think about that.

38:13.700 --> 38:14.700
Sorry, pumpkin.

38:14.700 --> 38:15.700
Do it.

38:15.700 --> 38:16.700
We're already on the bus.

38:16.700 --> 38:17.700
Let's see where it takes us.

38:17.700 --> 38:21.700
My friend and I have recently fallen into a friends with benefits situation.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.700
Right now, someone in this audience is like...

38:24.700 --> 38:25.700
Are you here?

38:25.700 --> 38:26.700
Wait, hold on.

38:26.700 --> 38:27.700
How many people...

38:27.700 --> 38:28.700
Like 18 people.

38:28.700 --> 38:29.700
Wait, I'm in that.

38:29.700 --> 38:30.700
That's right.

38:30.700 --> 38:31.700
That's me.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.700
I forgot I wrote into you guys, apparently.

38:33.700 --> 38:38.700
The problem is we're both new to this and don't know what benefits are and are not included.

38:38.700 --> 38:40.700
No dental.

38:40.700 --> 38:44.700
For...

38:44.700 --> 38:46.700
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.700
Damn.

38:48.700 --> 38:49.700
Raw, straight.

38:49.700 --> 38:50.700
No, just kidding.

38:50.700 --> 38:51.700
Use protection.

38:51.700 --> 38:57.700
This message is brought to you by responsibility.

38:57.700 --> 39:01.700
For instance, is it cool to make out and have sexy time?

39:01.700 --> 39:03.700
But what's not okay?

39:03.700 --> 39:06.700
Please help us clarify our weird, weird friendship.

39:06.700 --> 39:10.700
I think you fucked the reading of that question up eight different ways.

39:10.700 --> 39:15.700
You can't do to each other what Justin just did to that question.

39:15.700 --> 39:17.700
Okay, here's the beautiful thing.

39:17.700 --> 39:18.700
Can I finish?

39:18.700 --> 39:20.700
You can restart and do it better.

39:20.700 --> 39:21.700
Okay.

39:21.700 --> 39:24.700
It's cool to make out and have sexy times, but what's not okay?

39:24.700 --> 39:25.700
Dental.

39:25.700 --> 39:26.700
No, shit.

39:26.700 --> 39:27.700
Stop, stop, stop.

39:27.700 --> 39:28.700
I blew it.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.700
Please help us clarify our weird, weird, weird friendship.

39:31.700 --> 39:34.700
That's from Confundled Cuddle Companions.

39:34.700 --> 39:35.700
Oh my God, no.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.700
Okay, question.

39:37.700 --> 39:38.700
Two questions.

39:38.700 --> 39:41.700
Are you here and are both of you here?

39:41.700 --> 39:42.700
Awesome.

39:42.700 --> 39:43.700
Awesome.

39:43.700 --> 39:47.700
I think they were actually here the first time you read that question.

39:47.700 --> 39:51.700
They fucking were reduced to ash as soon as we started reading this question.

39:51.700 --> 39:53.700
We can still catch the end of the game if we hurry.

39:53.700 --> 39:54.700
Let's go.

39:54.700 --> 39:55.700
We're out.

39:55.700 --> 39:57.700
Here's the awesome thing about friends with benefits.

39:57.700 --> 39:58.700
Oh God.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.700
You've been married for a while.

40:00.700 --> 40:02.700
Griffin, are you getting a score update?

40:02.700 --> 40:05.700
I just wanted to check real quick.

40:05.700 --> 40:11.700
The awesome thing is this, is that it goes against what you would think where it actually

40:11.700 --> 40:16.700
like you can fall on bone, but don't hold hands.

40:16.700 --> 40:18.700
Yeah, it's weird, Trev.

40:18.700 --> 40:19.700
No, I feel what you're saying.

40:19.700 --> 40:21.700
That's what makes it so dynamic, so exciting.

40:21.700 --> 40:22.700
Thank you.

40:22.700 --> 40:26.700
It's why they made two fucking movies about it at the same goddamn time.

40:26.700 --> 40:31.700
Starting Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman and, hold on, I got this, I got this, Mila

40:31.700 --> 40:34.700
Kudus and fucking, hold up, I got this, Justin Timberlake.

40:34.700 --> 40:37.700
Yeah.

40:37.700 --> 40:42.700
Because it's the weird bell curve of that, of like if you're friends in a relationship,

40:42.700 --> 40:47.700
friends with benefits, you only get the two sides, but you don't get that middle, you

40:47.700 --> 40:48.700
don't get that intimacy.

40:48.700 --> 40:50.700
You don't need that intimacy.

40:50.700 --> 40:54.700
Yeah, it really is like we're boned, bye, and that's totally cool that you-

40:54.700 --> 40:59.700
That second step is so vitally important, but you have to say bye.

40:59.700 --> 41:05.700
But if you're dating and you take it seriously, you can't do that move.

41:05.700 --> 41:11.700
You can't be like, ah, we had a romantic dinner and then we had sex, bye.

41:11.700 --> 41:12.700
You can't do that.

41:12.700 --> 41:15.700
And you shouldn't say it like Borat, like my brother did.

41:15.700 --> 41:16.700
Bye.

41:16.700 --> 41:19.700
My wife will be home in a couple minutes.

41:19.700 --> 41:22.700
Yeah, my wife will be home soon, you should go.

41:22.700 --> 41:25.700
This will get weird.

41:25.700 --> 41:30.700
I got to say, I know this is, we're both, this is very exciting, it's very fucking sexual

41:30.700 --> 41:34.700
and it's a very exciting energy that we've injected into our relationship and I just

41:34.700 --> 41:40.700
got to say this whole thing's got me feeling very nice.

41:40.700 --> 41:41.700
That was fucking horrible.

41:41.700 --> 41:46.700
That was the worst Borat, I've done some pretty good Borat in my years.

41:46.700 --> 41:50.700
Hold on, let's give, we gave Justin a take two, Griffin.

41:50.700 --> 41:54.700
All right, let me try again.

41:54.700 --> 41:58.700
You lost all your consonants.

41:58.700 --> 42:03.700
It sounds like you just got bit by a snake.

42:03.700 --> 42:06.700
Ah, Borat.

42:06.700 --> 42:09.700
We just woke your baby up, for sure, for sure.

42:09.700 --> 42:11.700
No question.

42:11.700 --> 42:12.700
Should we go throw it to the audience?

42:12.700 --> 42:13.700
What's the score?

42:13.700 --> 42:15.700
I can't fucking find it online, apparently people won't give a shit.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.700
Two to eight.

42:17.700 --> 42:18.700
What?

42:18.700 --> 42:19.700
No.

42:19.700 --> 42:20.700
Holy shit, tied at half.

42:20.700 --> 42:22.700
Let's get some dogs.

42:22.700 --> 42:25.700
Badgers, yeah.

42:25.700 --> 42:29.700
Anyone here a fan of the Badgers?

42:29.700 --> 42:30.700
Apparently not.

42:30.700 --> 42:32.700
Apparently nobody, like 16 people.

42:32.700 --> 42:34.700
All right, let's go to the audience.

42:34.700 --> 42:35.700
Here's our rules.

42:35.700 --> 42:37.700
There's no bummer questions, please.

42:37.700 --> 42:38.700
No bummers.

42:38.700 --> 42:40.700
No bummers, we'll know.

42:40.700 --> 42:43.700
And no, it could be a bummer, but it'll be fine.

42:43.700 --> 42:46.700
The first fucking person we had up last night.

42:46.700 --> 42:49.700
Well, it might be, stop it.

42:49.700 --> 42:53.700
They actually quote said, it depends on how you answer.

42:53.700 --> 42:55.700
Don't put that fucking shit on us, dog.

42:55.700 --> 42:58.700
This is 100% your authorship.

42:58.700 --> 43:00.700
Own it, own it, stand in your place.

43:00.700 --> 43:02.700
Can we get a little bit of house lights?

43:02.700 --> 43:04.700
We got them right there, look.

43:04.700 --> 43:06.700
Ma'am, right here, yeah, come right here.

43:06.700 --> 43:08.700
Yes, you pointing at your head.

43:08.700 --> 43:10.700
Come right to the mic.

43:10.700 --> 43:13.700
This is the most fucking phantom zone set up.

43:13.700 --> 43:15.700
No, the mic is behind you.

43:15.700 --> 43:20.700
You've been tricked, we're doing this shit like a TED talk.

43:20.700 --> 43:23.700
Like a TED talk, have you seen a TED talk?

43:23.700 --> 43:26.700
Proceed with your question and await judgment.

43:26.700 --> 43:30.700
Just like any TED talk.

43:30.700 --> 43:33.700
Yes, I work in education, I've seen a lot of TED talks.

43:33.700 --> 43:36.700
Okay, fair enough, you just put us in our place.

43:36.700 --> 43:38.700
What's your name?

43:38.700 --> 43:39.700
My name is Heather.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.700
Hi, Heather.

43:41.700 --> 43:42.700
What's your question?

43:42.700 --> 43:43.700
Do you have a question?

43:43.700 --> 43:48.700
My question is, my husband had to move to California for business.

43:48.700 --> 43:53.700
And I'm going to see him for the first time in three weeks on Wednesday.

43:53.700 --> 43:56.700
What should I do when I see him?

43:56.700 --> 43:57.700
I don't know.

43:57.700 --> 44:01.700
Kiss him.

44:01.700 --> 44:03.700
You always come with the best lines, Trav.

44:03.700 --> 44:06.700
Kiss him on the face.

44:06.700 --> 44:08.700
Tell him you love him.

44:08.700 --> 44:11.700
Here's what I've learned, it's 2015.

44:11.700 --> 44:14.700
If you see someone and you haven't seen them for a while,

44:14.700 --> 44:19.700
and it doesn't go viral, then you don't have anything.

44:19.700 --> 44:23.700
The first thing you should say is, sorry I haven't YouTubed you.

44:23.700 --> 44:27.700
I'm saying like, you YouTubed the reunion.

44:27.700 --> 44:31.700
And if it doesn't have 15 mil by the end of the week,

44:31.700 --> 44:33.700
apparently your love is not very special.

44:33.700 --> 44:36.700
Do you also have a golden retriever that hasn't seen him in a while?

44:36.700 --> 44:38.700
Do you have a golden retriever that hasn't seen him?

44:38.700 --> 44:39.700
Because you'll be rich.

44:39.700 --> 44:40.700
Huge.

44:40.700 --> 44:42.700
I have a black lab border copy.

44:42.700 --> 44:43.700
Perfect either?

44:43.700 --> 44:44.700
Good enough.

44:44.700 --> 44:45.700
No, good enough.

44:45.700 --> 44:46.700
Well, I don't know.

44:46.700 --> 44:47.700
You might go bacterial.

44:47.700 --> 44:48.700
Good night!

44:48.700 --> 44:51.700
Wait, what?

44:51.700 --> 44:52.700
I don't understand.

44:52.700 --> 44:53.700
I didn't fucking get it.

44:53.700 --> 44:54.700
What?

44:54.700 --> 44:56.700
I didn't get the joke.

44:56.700 --> 44:57.700
That's disgusting.

44:57.700 --> 45:00.700
Lab, like lab?

45:00.700 --> 45:01.700
Viral.

45:01.700 --> 45:03.700
Like they do fucking like virus experiments in a lab?

45:03.700 --> 45:04.700
That was the joke?

45:04.700 --> 45:06.700
No, like viral bacteria, like it might go viral, anyway.

45:06.700 --> 45:09.700
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

45:09.700 --> 45:10.700
Okay.

45:10.700 --> 45:11.700
Fuck.

45:11.700 --> 45:13.700
Listen, let me ask you this.

45:13.700 --> 45:16.700
Have you picked up any new skills that you can impress them with?

45:16.700 --> 45:17.700
What?

45:17.700 --> 45:18.700
Did you learn the yo-yo?

45:18.700 --> 45:19.700
Did you learn the yo-yo?

45:19.700 --> 45:22.700
How quickly can you spray paint?

45:22.700 --> 45:24.700
Can you get up on a, what are you saying?

45:24.700 --> 45:25.700
Do what with spray paint?

45:25.700 --> 45:27.700
You throw up your tag on a local business?

45:27.700 --> 45:30.700
Now they do that where you make like a pyramid in front of a moon.

45:30.700 --> 45:33.700
It's like you'll never believe what you can do in 15 seconds.

45:33.700 --> 45:38.700
Are you having a stroke?

45:38.700 --> 45:45.700
Did you just, did you just do like an audio visual version of Illuminati like in our podcast?

45:45.700 --> 45:46.700
Hey guys, moon in front of a pyramid.

45:46.700 --> 45:47.700
Get it?

45:47.700 --> 45:48.700
Anyway, let's just move on.

45:48.700 --> 45:49.700
Don't worry about it.

45:49.700 --> 45:51.700
Any, uh, stardom races out there?

45:51.700 --> 45:52.700
Anyway, moving on.

45:52.700 --> 45:56.700
I'm pretty sure when I see him, he's going to tweet everything we do to you guys.

45:56.700 --> 45:57.700
Perfect.

45:57.700 --> 45:58.700
Perfect.

45:58.700 --> 45:59.700
That's-

45:59.700 --> 46:00.700
Give us a big round of applause.

46:00.700 --> 46:01.700
Oh, yeah.

46:01.700 --> 46:02.700
You, sir.

46:02.700 --> 46:03.700
Where?

46:03.700 --> 46:04.700
Where, where, where?

46:04.700 --> 46:05.700
Right over there.

46:05.700 --> 46:06.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:06.700 --> 46:07.700
Over here?

46:07.700 --> 46:08.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:08.700 --> 46:09.700
Come on up.

46:09.700 --> 46:10.700
It's over there.

46:10.700 --> 46:11.700
You're going the wrong way.

46:11.700 --> 46:12.700
You're going the wrong way.

46:12.700 --> 46:13.700
You're breaking my heart.

46:13.700 --> 46:14.700
Well, okay.

46:14.700 --> 46:15.700
Go away.

46:15.700 --> 46:16.700
You're right.

46:16.700 --> 46:17.700
You're right.

46:17.700 --> 46:18.700
You're right.

46:18.700 --> 46:19.700
No, yeah, yeah.

46:19.700 --> 46:22.700
You're driving this ship of your body.

46:22.700 --> 46:25.700
You're the captain of your body boat.

46:25.700 --> 46:27.700
You're interspacing this shit.

46:27.700 --> 46:28.700
No, yeah.

46:28.700 --> 46:29.700
Yeah, just go down there.

46:29.700 --> 46:30.700
You got it.

46:30.700 --> 46:31.700
You got it.

46:31.700 --> 46:34.700
You took the fucking craziest way you could.

46:34.700 --> 46:35.700
Good job, Marco Polo.

46:35.700 --> 46:36.700
You're almost there.

46:36.700 --> 46:37.700
Just, you know, circumnavigated the crowd.

46:37.700 --> 46:38.700
Hi.

46:38.700 --> 46:39.700
Okay.

46:39.700 --> 46:40.700
Hello.

46:40.700 --> 46:41.700
Hi.

46:41.700 --> 46:42.700
How we doing?

46:42.700 --> 46:43.700
Good.

46:43.700 --> 46:44.700
What is your name?

46:44.700 --> 46:45.700
My name is Cole.

46:45.700 --> 46:46.700
Hi, Cole.

46:46.700 --> 46:47.700
How you guys doing?

46:47.700 --> 46:48.700
Good.

46:48.700 --> 46:49.700
How are you?

46:49.700 --> 46:50.700
I'm good.

46:50.700 --> 46:51.700
How are you?

46:51.700 --> 46:52.700
I'm nervous as shit.

46:52.700 --> 46:53.700
No, Cole, you need to relax.

46:53.700 --> 46:54.700
What is your question?

46:54.700 --> 46:55.700
You're fine.

46:55.700 --> 46:56.700
What is your question?

46:56.700 --> 47:02.700
Well, it's more of an advice question as far as, in regards to my girlfriend.

47:02.700 --> 47:03.700
Okay.

47:03.700 --> 47:04.700
Is your girlfriend here?

47:04.700 --> 47:05.700
She is.

47:05.700 --> 47:06.700
Yeah, she is.

47:06.700 --> 47:07.700
Where are you, Cole's girlfriend?

47:07.700 --> 47:08.700
Cole's girlfriend coming here.

47:08.700 --> 47:09.700
Yeah.

47:09.700 --> 47:12.700
If you're material to the conversation, I feel like it's only fair if you were also

47:12.700 --> 47:13.700
present.

47:13.700 --> 47:14.700
Yeah.

47:14.700 --> 47:17.700
Everyone let her pass so she doesn't have to do the weird walk around.

47:17.700 --> 47:20.700
Let Cole's girlfriend go through so we can ask the questions simultaneously.

47:20.700 --> 47:21.700
Sorry.

47:21.700 --> 47:23.700
Because sometimes I worry that I'm saying heinous shit.

47:23.700 --> 47:24.700
All right.

47:24.700 --> 47:25.700
Cole.

47:25.700 --> 47:26.700
Yes.

47:26.700 --> 47:27.700
Okay.

47:27.700 --> 47:28.700
What is your question?

47:28.700 --> 47:29.700
This is my lovely girlfriend, Meredith.

47:29.700 --> 47:30.700
Hi, Meredith.

47:30.700 --> 47:31.700
How's it going?

47:31.700 --> 47:35.700
So I have something pretty major that I want to ask her.

47:35.700 --> 47:37.700
What's that, Cole?

47:37.700 --> 47:43.700
In your personal opinion, like, what is the best time to share something just like life

47:43.700 --> 47:44.700
changing and major?

47:44.700 --> 47:45.700
Oh, man.

47:45.700 --> 47:46.700
Right now.

47:46.700 --> 47:47.700
Right now.

47:47.700 --> 47:48.700
Yeah, I think like pretty much right now would be a good time.

47:48.700 --> 47:52.700
If I was at a comedy podcast, right now would be the moment that I would do that.

47:52.700 --> 47:53.700
This would be the time, Cole.

47:53.700 --> 47:54.700
Yeah.

47:54.700 --> 47:55.700
Cole, that's, I would do it now.

47:55.700 --> 47:56.700
Oh, shit.

47:56.700 --> 48:11.300
I want to hear every word, Cole.

48:11.300 --> 48:12.300
Don't you mumble this.

48:12.300 --> 48:13.300
Don't keep this private.

48:13.300 --> 48:14.300
We made the whole thing public.

48:14.300 --> 48:15.300
Let's do it.

48:15.300 --> 48:16.300
Everyone, hold on, hold on.

48:16.300 --> 48:17.300
Deliver.

48:17.300 --> 48:18.300
I want to hear Cole.

48:18.300 --> 48:19.300
I just want to hear Cole's line.

48:19.300 --> 48:22.300
What do you work up, Cole?

48:22.300 --> 48:23.300
Oh, God.

48:23.300 --> 48:26.460
Baby, I love you so much.

48:26.460 --> 48:28.580
I you mean the world to me.

48:28.580 --> 48:30.020
You're my best friend.

48:30.020 --> 48:32.100
You're my family.

48:32.100 --> 48:38.020
And I'm so lucky to share my life with you.

48:38.020 --> 48:46.300
I'm excited to absolute silence and I'm also excited to share the rest of my life with

48:46.300 --> 48:47.300
you.

48:47.300 --> 49:00.620
Will you please marry me?

49:00.620 --> 49:12.140
Yeah.

49:12.140 --> 49:13.140
Thank you, guys.

49:13.140 --> 49:14.140
Okay, now sit down.

49:14.140 --> 49:15.140
It's our show.

49:15.140 --> 49:16.140
Next.

49:16.140 --> 49:17.140
No, no, hold on.

49:17.140 --> 49:18.140
Are you fucking kidding me?

49:18.140 --> 49:19.140
Don't sit down.

49:19.140 --> 49:20.140
Now, okay.

49:20.140 --> 49:21.140
Do your thing and then go.

49:21.140 --> 49:22.140
Okay, no.

49:22.140 --> 49:23.140
They're gone.

49:23.140 --> 49:24.140
Okay.

49:24.140 --> 49:25.140
Feel bad for the next.

49:25.140 --> 49:29.880
My roommate's stealing my cottage cheese and I'm really bummed out about it or whatever.

49:29.880 --> 49:33.100
I tried to deploy On the Wings of Love.

49:33.100 --> 49:38.780
Technically, I thought it might fucking accentuate your romantic experience, but it didn't work.

49:38.780 --> 49:40.320
I love this, dude.

49:40.320 --> 49:41.320
Right there.

49:41.320 --> 49:42.420
Oh, I got this.

49:42.420 --> 49:43.420
Yeah.

49:43.420 --> 49:44.420
No.

49:44.420 --> 49:45.500
Let's see what you got.

49:45.500 --> 49:47.500
Yeah, go, go! You're falling off!

49:47.500 --> 49:50.200
You do it! Didn't even waver the ass right!

49:50.200 --> 49:52.200
Yeah, he's gonna keep the show going.

49:52.200 --> 49:52.700
Hello.

49:52.700 --> 49:53.700
Hi, what's your name?

49:53.700 --> 49:54.200
Hi!

49:54.200 --> 49:55.200
My name's William.

49:55.200 --> 49:56.200
Hey, William.

49:56.200 --> 49:57.200
They call me Hansel.

49:57.200 --> 49:58.700
H-Hansel? Okay, sure!

49:58.700 --> 49:59.700
That's my last name.

49:59.700 --> 50:00.700
That's your last name?

50:00.700 --> 50:01.700
Hansel, okay. Got it.

50:01.700 --> 50:03.200
Hansel, he's still home on it now.

50:03.200 --> 50:04.200
Yeah, thank you.

50:04.200 --> 50:10.200
I, uh, I emailed you about my question, and I had the exact same question as Cole.

50:10.200 --> 50:12.200
Oh, okay, fuck! Back to back!

50:12.200 --> 50:13.200
What?!

50:13.200 --> 50:14.200
Double barrel!

50:14.200 --> 50:15.200
Shotgun!

50:15.200 --> 50:17.200
Is your girlfriend or boyfriend here?

50:17.200 --> 50:18.200
Yes, she is.

50:18.200 --> 50:20.200
Could she come up to the microphone, please?

50:20.200 --> 50:21.200
Fuck!

50:21.200 --> 50:22.200
Yes!

50:36.200 --> 50:38.200
Ask it! Ask it!

50:38.200 --> 50:44.200
Will you marry me and stuff?

50:55.200 --> 50:57.200
I have a second question.

51:01.200 --> 51:03.200
Never mind, it's all good.

51:03.200 --> 51:05.200
Thank you so much.

51:05.200 --> 51:08.200
Congratulations, everybody!

51:08.200 --> 51:09.200
Yeah!

51:11.200 --> 51:13.200
Fuck it! Fuck it! Anybody else?

51:13.200 --> 51:14.200
Anybody else?

51:14.200 --> 51:16.200
Yeah, you! Fuck it!

51:16.200 --> 51:17.200
You, get over there!

51:17.200 --> 51:19.200
Who else wants to get engaged? Tonight!

51:19.200 --> 51:20.200
I'm not fucking kidding!

51:20.200 --> 51:23.200
Only marriages now! Only marriages!

51:23.200 --> 51:26.200
Fuck comedy, fuck advice, we're getting fucking married!

51:26.200 --> 51:27.200
Everybody here tonight!

51:27.200 --> 51:29.200
Where's your girlfriend or boyfriend?

51:29.200 --> 51:32.200
Well, sh- well, shit, um...

51:32.200 --> 51:36.200
Don't you fucking step on my- I'm on a fucking groove right now!

51:36.200 --> 51:37.200
Come on!

51:37.200 --> 51:39.200
I can do fucking anything!

51:39.200 --> 51:41.200
What do you got?

51:42.200 --> 51:46.200
Well, shit, I didn't think you were saying who else wanted to get engaged.

51:46.200 --> 51:48.200
Yeah, of course, that's what I-

51:51.200 --> 51:55.200
That's too bad, sir! You're getting engaged tonight!

51:55.200 --> 51:58.200
Pick someone from the crowd!

51:58.200 --> 52:04.200
Do we have any tributes who will be engaged to this man?

52:07.200 --> 52:10.200
I thought we had a streak going.

52:10.200 --> 52:12.200
Tell us about... whatever...

52:12.200 --> 52:15.200
What are you doing, Travis? He's not gonna get engaged, okay? It's over.

52:15.200 --> 52:18.200
The streak's over. You can stop filming the audience.

52:18.200 --> 52:21.200
Shhh! Three would have gone viral! Yes, I agree with you, Travis!

52:21.200 --> 52:23.200
Three proposals would have gone viral!

52:23.200 --> 52:25.200
I'm still holding out hope!

52:25.200 --> 52:29.200
Did anybody video both of them so we can get viral something?

52:29.200 --> 52:33.200
Yeah, congratulations! Get that onto the tube soon, okay?

52:33.200 --> 52:35.200
Congratulations to everybody, by the way!

52:35.200 --> 52:37.200
Okay, so sorry!

52:37.200 --> 52:38.200
Wait!

52:38.200 --> 52:41.200
Wait, are you looking at your girlfriend right now, boy?

52:41.200 --> 52:43.200
Huh? Can you?

52:43.200 --> 52:45.200
I'm looking at my girlfriend right now and saying,

52:45.200 --> 52:47.200
Do you wanna get engaged, Travis?

52:47.200 --> 52:50.200
What a great time to have that conversation!

52:50.200 --> 52:52.200
Oh, she's coming up!

52:52.200 --> 52:55.200
Hold on! She's coming up!

52:55.200 --> 52:59.200
Holy shit! She's coming up to the microphone!

53:00.200 --> 53:04.200
You two, listen! Listen, look at me right now. Listen to me for a second.

53:04.200 --> 53:05.200
What's up?

53:05.200 --> 53:08.200
This world is hard.

53:08.200 --> 53:11.200
Shut up. This world is hard.

53:11.200 --> 53:15.200
And if you find somebody that you wanna wake up every morning and look at,

53:15.200 --> 53:19.200
then you grab that person and you cling to him.

53:19.200 --> 53:21.200
And you never let go.

53:21.200 --> 53:23.200
You're the person that I wanna spend your life with.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.200
Madam, if you don't feel that way about this gentleman,

53:25.200 --> 53:27.200
know that this isn't binding.

53:27.200 --> 53:29.200
We have lots of other dudes here.

53:29.200 --> 53:31.200
We can put you with any one of them.

53:31.200 --> 53:33.200
There's a lot of fish in the sea.

53:33.200 --> 53:35.200
There are a lot of fish in this room.

53:35.200 --> 53:40.200
If you find the person that completes you, don't waste another second.

53:40.200 --> 53:42.200
Devote the rest of your life to them.

53:42.200 --> 53:44.200
Have you heard the good news?

53:44.200 --> 53:52.200
We cannot express enough how viral the three-peat will go.

53:52.200 --> 53:54.200
I don't wanna break shit justice flow,

53:54.200 --> 53:57.200
but Travis, you're filming this in a vertically angled video

53:57.200 --> 53:58.200
and it's fucking killing me.

53:58.200 --> 53:59.200
Yeah, Travis.

53:59.200 --> 54:01.200
Thank you. Yes.

54:01.200 --> 54:03.200
Thank you. Turn this to the side for us.

54:03.200 --> 54:05.200
Okay. Okay.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.200
Sir. Madam.

54:07.200 --> 54:09.200
What do you got for us?

54:09.200 --> 54:13.200
Can we cook up a three-peat?

54:13.200 --> 54:16.200
Do you wanna break traditional gender norms?

54:16.200 --> 54:18.200
Oh, shit!

54:18.200 --> 54:20.200
What?

54:20.200 --> 54:23.200
A progressive three-peat!

54:23.200 --> 54:25.200
A three Patricia.

54:25.200 --> 54:27.200
If you will.

54:27.200 --> 54:29.200
That's pretty good.

54:29.200 --> 54:31.200
This is so spec...

54:31.200 --> 54:33.200
Listen, don't...

54:33.200 --> 54:35.200
No, now I'm starting to feel very, very guilty.

54:35.200 --> 54:37.200
I'm starting to feel guilty.

54:37.200 --> 54:39.200
We only vetted the first one.

54:39.200 --> 54:41.200
Why don't you guys commit to something less big right now?

54:41.200 --> 54:43.200
Like a weekend duet.

54:43.200 --> 54:45.200
Where do you go on a three-day weekend with me?

54:45.200 --> 54:47.200
Do you wanna commit to something less?

54:47.200 --> 54:49.200
Do you wanna go on vacation this summer?

54:49.200 --> 54:51.200
Do you wanna go to the Wisconsin belt?

54:51.200 --> 54:53.200
Do you wanna go to Flood Rockers?

54:53.200 --> 54:55.200
We gotta pivot our brand real quick.

54:55.200 --> 54:58.200
You two are currently living through the most uncomfortable moments of your lives

54:58.200 --> 55:00.200
and we're gonna get you through it.

55:00.200 --> 55:02.200
We're gonna get you through it alive.

55:02.200 --> 55:04.200
Tomorrow's gonna come and you're not even gonna remember it.

55:04.200 --> 55:06.200
This is not the only moment in time.

55:06.200 --> 55:08.200
It's gonna keep going on and you won't always be standing there.

55:08.200 --> 55:10.200
You're not locked to anything that's happening right now.

55:10.200 --> 55:12.200
You'll just be up here doing a podcast.

55:14.200 --> 55:17.200
We did have our first date in approximately this spot.

55:17.200 --> 55:19.200
A week ago.

55:21.200 --> 55:24.200
I'll give you a free poster if you ask him to marry you.

55:24.200 --> 55:26.200
That's fucked up. Come on. What the fuck?

55:26.200 --> 55:29.200
You don't need a goddamn poster dowry.

55:29.200 --> 55:31.200
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

55:31.200 --> 55:34.200
I'll give you a poster and a chest of jewels.

55:34.200 --> 55:37.200
This is turning on me. We have geese for you.

55:37.200 --> 55:39.200
Mr. Travis McElroy.

55:39.200 --> 55:40.200
Yes, sir.

55:40.200 --> 55:42.200
Magnet or no deal?

55:47.200 --> 55:49.200
It's pretty funny.

55:49.200 --> 55:53.200
It was a $3.50 magnet.

55:55.200 --> 55:59.200
Am I willing to marry two people for $3.50?

56:01.200 --> 56:03.200
I'm looking at my wife.

56:03.200 --> 56:05.200
Oh no, she ducked away from the window.

56:05.200 --> 56:07.200
I'm gonna say yes.

56:07.200 --> 56:09.200
Oh, now it's on.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.200
Didn't think I'd give up the magnet.

56:11.200 --> 56:14.200
Travis has called your $3 bluff.

56:15.200 --> 56:17.200
It's high stakes here, my brother.

56:17.200 --> 56:19.200
My brother and me, Milwaukee.

56:20.200 --> 56:22.200
We've been standing up here for maybe...

56:22.200 --> 56:24.200
Yeah, for 100,000 years.

56:24.200 --> 56:27.200
You need to pop or get off the pot.

56:27.200 --> 56:31.200
Please do not let yourself be goaded into a marriage by a podcast.

56:31.200 --> 56:32.200
You're better than this.

56:32.200 --> 56:35.200
And if you do, let it be a better podcast.

56:35.200 --> 56:37.200
Right.

56:37.200 --> 56:40.200
I would let Superego let me get married, but not us.

56:40.200 --> 56:44.200
If Night Vale told me to get married, I would do it, and I'm already married.

56:45.200 --> 56:47.200
Why don't you think about it?

56:47.200 --> 56:51.200
Think about it, and the next time we're in Milwaukee, you can propose then.

56:51.200 --> 56:53.200
In six years, you can propose again.

56:54.200 --> 56:56.200
Can we have a big round of applause?

56:58.200 --> 57:00.200
Thank you, Lighting Guy.

57:00.200 --> 57:01.200
That's sweet.

57:01.200 --> 57:03.200
For the record.

57:03.200 --> 57:04.200
For the record.

57:04.200 --> 57:07.200
I promised I wouldn't embarrass you in front of 600 people.

57:07.200 --> 57:08.200
Fucking great job, Dom.

57:08.200 --> 57:09.200
How'd that go?

57:09.200 --> 57:10.200
How'd that go?

57:10.200 --> 57:11.200
The worst job.

57:11.200 --> 57:13.200
It is her birthday today.

57:14.200 --> 57:15.200
Okay, wait, hold on.

57:15.200 --> 57:17.200
We can at least do this.

57:17.200 --> 57:18.200
Happy birthday.

57:18.200 --> 57:19.200
No, we cannot.

57:19.200 --> 57:20.200
No, no, no, no.

57:20.200 --> 57:21.200
We don't have the rights.

57:21.200 --> 57:23.200
So, happy birthday.

57:23.200 --> 57:24.200
You did it.

57:24.200 --> 57:25.200
Another year.

57:25.200 --> 57:28.200
Congratulations.

57:28.200 --> 57:29.200
What's your name?

57:29.200 --> 57:30.200
Becky.

57:30.200 --> 57:31.200
Becky?

57:31.200 --> 57:32.200
Becky!

57:32.200 --> 57:35.200
That's the first jingle in four years.

57:35.200 --> 57:36.200
Yeah.

57:37.200 --> 57:38.200
Listen.

57:38.200 --> 57:39.200
We got...

57:39.200 --> 57:40.200
We done?

57:40.200 --> 57:41.200
Yeah.

57:41.200 --> 57:43.200
We have one more question from...

57:43.200 --> 57:44.200
Thank you all.

57:44.200 --> 57:45.200
You've been great.

57:45.200 --> 57:46.200
Give them a big round of applause.

57:46.200 --> 57:47.200
I think we're done.

57:47.200 --> 57:48.200
Listen.

57:48.200 --> 57:49.200
What?

57:49.200 --> 57:50.200
Let's end it.

57:50.200 --> 57:51.200
Yeah.

57:51.200 --> 57:52.200
Listen, guys.

57:52.200 --> 57:53.200
Thank you all so much.

57:53.200 --> 57:55.200
Thank you to Turner Hall for being so kind to us.

57:55.200 --> 57:56.200
Yeah.

57:56.200 --> 57:57.200
Thank you, Milwaukee.

57:57.200 --> 58:01.200
Thank you for missing the game to be with us and hang out.

58:01.200 --> 58:04.200
Thank you for being such a cool city and being so nice to us.

58:04.200 --> 58:06.200
Also, I want to say thank you to Justin Gray.

58:06.200 --> 58:09.200
Justin Gray designed some awesome show-specific posters.

58:09.200 --> 58:10.200
Yeah.

58:10.200 --> 58:11.200
They say this...

58:11.200 --> 58:13.200
Like, they're only for sale here at this show,

58:13.200 --> 58:15.200
and they are about this show, so...

58:15.200 --> 58:18.200
So, it shows the venue and the city, and get them.

58:18.200 --> 58:19.200
Get them.

58:19.200 --> 58:20.200
They're fucking rad.

58:20.200 --> 58:21.200
We stole some already.

58:21.200 --> 58:22.200
They're available right back there.

58:22.200 --> 58:23.200
Yeah.

58:23.200 --> 58:24.200
Do that.

58:24.200 --> 58:25.200
Uh...

58:25.200 --> 58:26.200
John Rodgers?

58:26.200 --> 58:27.200
Thank you, John Rodgers,

58:27.200 --> 58:29.200
in the long winter to do these sort of things.

58:29.200 --> 58:32.200
I'm putting the days to bed.

58:32.200 --> 58:38.200
Thank you to Sawbones for opening for us and being so amazing.

58:38.200 --> 58:43.200
Thank you to the person who gave us this bottle that was full

58:43.200 --> 58:45.200
like an hour and a half ago.

58:45.200 --> 58:46.200
Comedy Juice.

58:46.200 --> 58:47.200
Thank you, Comedy Juice.

58:47.200 --> 58:49.200
From Repeal Reserve.

58:49.200 --> 58:50.200
Delicious.

58:50.200 --> 58:51.200
Delicious stuff.

58:51.200 --> 58:53.200
Thank you to our wives who aren't in Sawbones,

58:53.200 --> 58:55.200
Teresa and Rachel, for being so amazing.

58:55.200 --> 58:56.200
So fucking rad.

58:56.200 --> 58:58.200
Thank you so much.

58:58.200 --> 59:00.200
Final Yahoo from my brother Griffin.

59:00.200 --> 59:03.200
We're going to think about this, and we'll come back to it next week

59:03.200 --> 59:06.200
and talk about it like we always do.

59:06.200 --> 59:09.200
Shut up.

59:09.200 --> 59:12.200
This final Yahoo was sent in by Samuel Ginsberg.

59:12.200 --> 59:13.200
Thank you, Samuel.

59:13.200 --> 59:17.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jason, who asks,

59:17.200 --> 59:22.200
What religion are the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?

59:22.200 --> 59:24.200
My name is Justin McElroy.

59:24.200 --> 59:25.200
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:25.200 --> 59:26.200
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:26.200 --> 59:28.200
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

59:28.200 --> 59:30.200
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

59:48.200 --> 59:49.200
Hey.

59:49.200 --> 59:52.200
I wanted to remind you about Blue Apron.

59:52.200 --> 59:55.200
Thank you so much to them for helping make this show possible.

59:55.200 --> 59:58.200
You can get your first two meals for free by going to

59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.200
BlueApron.com slash my brother.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.200
We also want to say thanks again to NatureBox,

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.200
where you can order hundreds of great tasting snacks,

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.200
healthy snacks.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.200
Go to NatureBox.com slash my brother to sign up

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.200
for your free sample box of great tasting, healthy snacks.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.200
And one more time, if you live in the Pacific Northwest,

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.200
Seattle, Portland, or Vancouver, or anywhere around there,

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.200
we're going to be doing a live show there,

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.200
live shows, I should say, in each city.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.200
At the end of August, you can get tickets,

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.200
everything you need to know at bit.ly

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.200
forward slash MBMBAM Portland,

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.200
bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Seattle,

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:35.200
and bit.ly forward slash van, V-A-N, MBMBAM.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.200
And just so you know, the Seattle show corresponds

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.200
with PAX, but it is not PAX affiliated,

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.200
so you still have to buy tickets,

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.200
even if you already have passes to PAX.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.200
But you don't need a pass.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.200
You don't need a pass to pass.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.200
It's a totally separate thing.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.200
Anyway, yeah, thanks for listening.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.200
Okay, bye.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.200
