00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.280
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.960
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.640
I'm that sweet baby and 30 under 30 media boy Griffin McElroy.

00:54.640 --> 01:01.520
I've got it. The next branch of the expansion of the McElroy brothers franchise, we of course are

01:01.520 --> 01:10.000
going to appear in the Trolls 2 film coming out in April 2020. We've got that already sort of locked

01:10.000 --> 01:15.840
down. That's in the back. It's practically in the can. We didn't mention this, we've got an

01:15.840 --> 01:18.880
episode of that show up if you want to listen to that about how we're going to be in Trolls 2.

01:18.880 --> 01:25.280
But that that is then and happening. That's already in the books. The important thing is

01:25.280 --> 01:28.480
that you don't rest on your laurels. It's the future past part of that ball.

01:28.480 --> 01:33.520
It will have already been done. We're basically in Trolls 3 at this fucking point.

01:33.520 --> 01:36.880
Yeah, well with the continuity and the story and shit, you know?

01:36.880 --> 01:40.960
Yeah. We do, for what I'm talking about, we do need to

01:40.960 --> 01:51.680
sort of watch on the profanity for a little bit. Because my thing is, a couple weeks ago,

01:52.240 --> 02:00.400
Nickelodeon announced that he's coming back. Who? Blue. Or she? Blues or she? Blue's coming back,

02:00.400 --> 02:03.440
folks. And that's the important thing that we want to talk about here.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.800
Blue of Blue's Clues?

02:04.800 --> 02:11.360
Blue of Blue's Clues is coming back and they're looking for new Steve.

02:14.080 --> 02:23.360
Yes. So you see sort of where I am talking about now. They're looking for new Steve. Now,

02:23.360 --> 02:30.560
I know what you're saying. Joe is already new Steve. Well, that's fine. But Joe is Steve 2.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.880
Now they're looking for Steve 3, the third Steve.

02:32.880 --> 02:37.920
Joe's out? Joe's been out since O7 when the show was canceled.

02:39.280 --> 02:43.920
Yeah. They solved the case. Blue got all the clues. They solved the murder.

02:43.920 --> 02:49.680
They finally caught the murderer that murdered Blue's family. And now they're back for a new

02:50.640 --> 02:57.280
run at Blue's Clues. And who's the new Steve gonna be? And I submit it is us, the McElroy brothers.

02:57.280 --> 03:02.080
Now, when you say you submit, did you actually take any steps?

03:02.080 --> 03:08.400
Of the secret, like, vision board? You submitted it to God and the universe and stuff?

03:09.040 --> 03:16.160
I feel like I'm using all my sort of, like, God and vision quest praying that energy I'm

03:16.160 --> 03:20.240
using on Trolls 2 currently. I want Nickelodeon to do this one because it's gonna make them a

03:20.240 --> 03:24.960
lot of fucking dosh. Okay, Justin, what did we just say? What did we just say?

03:24.960 --> 03:26.640
Yeah, again. Double damn it.

03:26.640 --> 03:31.200
We'll just have to replace him with, like, meh.

03:31.200 --> 03:35.760
Yeah, like the male. Every time we cuss in this episode, I'll edit in the male song.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.280
Probably you won't, I would think.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.840
No, because then the show would end up being four hours long.

03:41.840 --> 03:47.200
It's a long ass song. It's a long butt. See, there it is. It's a very long,

03:47.200 --> 03:51.680
here's the male, it never fails, it makes me wanna work with him.

03:51.680 --> 03:59.840
It might be a little soon to start this, but let's start the negotiation with Nickelodeon.

03:59.840 --> 04:09.840
We will cut it back to one f-word per episode. We will restrain ourselves to one f per episode.

04:09.840 --> 04:14.400
And sometimes we'll hide it. We'll do it real quiet and fast and so the kiddos may not even

04:14.400 --> 04:19.600
be like, here's the male, it never fails, fuck, it makes me want, and they may not even get that

04:19.600 --> 04:32.800
it was there at all. Now, one problem that I found with Steve Quest, there are three boys on this

04:32.800 --> 04:38.560
show. Yeah, on this one there's three. Oh, you know, I never think of us as separate people.

04:38.560 --> 04:45.680
I know, but there's three boys and only, Steve is only the one boy.

04:45.680 --> 04:52.960
So, we're gonna have to solve that first. Do you think like an Olsen twins thing?

04:53.520 --> 04:58.960
No, let's see who's gonna be the best Steve. I'll be Blue first and Travis you be Steve

04:58.960 --> 05:01.920
and Griffin you be a Clue, okay? Whenever you're ready.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.560
What's that, Blue? I'm a skull on the ground.

05:07.120 --> 05:10.000
What's that, Blue? A vicious murder?

05:10.000 --> 05:16.160
What do you smell, Blue? Semen? Oh, no.

05:17.840 --> 05:22.560
Someone got semen on the dang skull. Someone got semen on the fucking skull.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.240
That's my one. There's your one.

05:25.360 --> 05:29.840
Okay, very good. All right, now I'm Steve. I was about to have a big dramatic monologue

05:29.840 --> 05:34.640
about how my parents were killed and this is bringing back too many memories.

05:35.280 --> 05:39.760
But then I was gonna CSI that stuff and like, you interrupted me too soon.

05:39.760 --> 05:43.600
I had a monologue memorized. Oh, great. Well, go ahead and perform that now.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.280
I'll give you complete silence. Thank you.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.720
Oh, no. I don't want this.

05:48.720 --> 05:57.600
The semen, it reminds me of that terrible day in the alley when that person tried to mug my parents

05:58.800 --> 06:06.160
and kill them and on that day I became Steve. I became the thing that scared me so I could scare

06:06.160 --> 06:10.400
villains. Steve. I'm a Batman. You look in the mirror and you're like,

06:10.400 --> 06:13.360
what scares me? Well, Steve. Steve.

06:13.360 --> 06:16.160
Steve scares me. A Steve flew into the room.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.600
I found the Steve trapped inside that old grandfather clock.

06:22.400 --> 06:28.080
I fell into the old Steve Guttenberg cave behind our house. There were Steve's everywhere.

06:28.080 --> 06:34.640
Chocoblock with Goots. Steve's. And on that day, that's when I became Steve.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.520
Steve. Okay, that's very good. Griffin,

06:37.520 --> 06:42.080
do you want to try being the Steve and I'll be a clue and Travis, you be Blue?

06:42.080 --> 06:48.000
Yes, I'm gonna be the reboot Blue though. This feels okay, but you saying that makes

06:48.000 --> 06:51.440
me think that this is gonna be sort of a Travis-led skit.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.520
What? How dare you, sir?

06:53.520 --> 06:55.920
No, I feel like this is- Three classes at UCB.

06:55.920 --> 06:59.280
Yeah. I'm ready to yes and you,

06:59.280 --> 07:02.400
I'm gonna build you up. This really feels like it's gonna be

07:02.400 --> 07:06.320
a Travis skit featuring Griffin. Okay, to be fair,

07:06.320 --> 07:10.400
my Blue is going to speak English, but I will. Yeah, again, that's-

07:10.400 --> 07:13.120
I will do basic Blue. I will be a basic Blue.

07:13.120 --> 07:15.760
Let me try. All right. Hey, you kids want to learn some maths?

07:15.760 --> 07:18.720
Today, we're gonna be talking about- Hey, stop it. Get out of here.

07:18.720 --> 07:21.600
I'm talking and teaching the kids about multiplication. Dog?

07:23.280 --> 07:26.560
Dog, I will not with you again. Not today. It's math day.

07:26.560 --> 07:34.800
It's math day, dog. Get, get, get. I love you. I love you, but get.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.800
It's math day, not dog day. That's mine. I'm done.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.800
Okay. That's very good.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.400
Yeah, it's like he's very focused, mine is, and he doesn't have time to-

07:44.400 --> 07:47.680
Oh, wait, hold on. Fuck. Okay, great. Thank you.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.680
Justin, you want to play? Yeah.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.680
All right. Who wants to be- I'll be dog.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.680
All right. We'll try to share a clue. Yeah.

07:57.680 --> 08:05.680
Oh, my God. What's- Blue, what's wrong? Blue, what-

08:05.680 --> 08:11.680
The Lego. I'm the Lego.

08:15.680 --> 08:19.680
Steve, say something funny. All right. I'm going to draw a picture of

08:19.680 --> 08:23.680
a Lego in my notebook. No, a hospital.

08:23.680 --> 08:29.680
Please free me from this shit prison. Guys, I'm drawing. Give me just a second.

08:29.680 --> 08:33.680
Fuck. Oh, wait. I used yours. Sorry.

08:33.680 --> 08:37.680
But it doesn't have his. All right. So that's fine.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.680
Yeah, jeez, I think this one's a real surefire dinger.

08:39.680 --> 08:49.680
Who do you think should be the ste- We'll have to vote. We'll put a poll up.

08:49.680 --> 08:53.680
Yeah, yeah. We can't decide this. We got to leave it up to the listeners.

08:53.680 --> 08:57.680
So if you look around on the internet, you'll find a poll about which of us should be Steve.

08:57.680 --> 09:01.680
And then make sure to send the results of that poll to Nickelodeon.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.680
Yes. All right.

09:03.680 --> 09:07.680
I also have another branch for us, but we can talk about it later.

09:07.680 --> 09:11.680
I think I've got an inroad at the Lifeway Christian bookstore.

09:11.680 --> 09:15.680
Oh, nice. Yeah, we can rap about that later. We'll do it off the air.

09:15.680 --> 09:21.680
Perfect. This is an advice show where we try to help people.

09:21.680 --> 09:25.680
I'm recovering from a cold, so if you hear me, drop off at any point.

09:25.680 --> 09:29.680
The coughs are rough today. They're rough and ragged.

09:29.680 --> 09:33.680
And I'm just hanging in there, folks. I'm just trying to stay alive.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.680
Are we listening to our ailment? I've got two torn ACLs.

09:36.680 --> 09:38.680
I feel great.

09:38.680 --> 09:42.680
Okay. Podcasting's too hard. Blew them right the fuck out.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.680
I don't feel bad. What about your scholarship?

09:44.680 --> 09:48.680
Yeah, I'm worried about the scholarship, Trav. I don't think Purdue's going to have me.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.680
What about your Steve audition?

09:50.680 --> 09:54.680
Yeah, I don't think Purdue's going to have me on that one either.

09:54.680 --> 09:58.680
So as a result of my wife's employer's strange bonus slash giveaway strategy,

09:58.680 --> 10:03.680
I'm in possession of $35 gift cards to a grocery store chain.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.680
And I don't know how to spend them. If I spend them all at once,

10:07.680 --> 10:12.680
I'll surely earn the score under the cashier and impatient customers waiting behind me in the checkout lane.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.680
If the checkout process is already stressful enough,

10:15.680 --> 10:20.680
any advice on how to use these gift cards in a respectful yet efficient manner?

10:20.680 --> 10:26.680
And that's from Gotta Get Rid of These Gift Cards in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

10:26.680 --> 10:33.680
Well, I went to that combination Babies R Us and Toys R Us over the weekend.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.680
I think it's going over there.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.680
Oh.

10:36.680 --> 10:41.680
Have you seen 28 Days Later?

10:41.680 --> 10:42.680
Yeah.

10:42.680 --> 10:45.680
Wait, that's not the romantic comedy with-

10:45.680 --> 10:50.680
No, that's 28 Days with Sandra Bullock and Alan Tudyk.

10:50.680 --> 10:51.680
Talking about 28 Days-

10:51.680 --> 10:53.680
I mean, I'm sure there's other people in it too, but those are the only two that matter.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.680
And 28 Days Later is the sequel.

10:55.680 --> 10:56.680
Right.

10:56.680 --> 10:57.680
With zombies in it.

10:57.680 --> 11:01.680
Where Alan Tudyk is a zombie and eats Sandra Bullock for the entire two hours.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.680
We go there to get-

11:02.680 --> 11:03.680
It's just that scene.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.680
We go there to get baby food because they got the choice selection.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.680
They got that gourmet shit, that Wolfgang-

11:08.680 --> 11:10.680
They got that dank baby food.

11:10.680 --> 11:16.680
That Wolfgang Puck genuine baby food that he cooks up in his kitchen full of.

11:16.680 --> 11:22.680
And we pulled up in the parking lot and we're instantly like, oh no.

11:22.680 --> 11:26.680
And we went ahead with our mission because baby gotta eat.

11:26.680 --> 11:27.680
Baby gotta eat.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.680
You can't just give the baby a hamburger from a Wendy's.

11:30.680 --> 11:33.680
You have to give them the special stuff that Wolfgang's made for them.

11:33.680 --> 11:45.680
And that checkout process, folks were bringing out some gift cards from 1983 that they have just been chilling on.

11:45.680 --> 11:50.680
I watched somebody buy a stroller with approximately 15 gift cards.

11:50.680 --> 11:51.680
It was horrible.

11:51.680 --> 11:54.680
It was a get out of line and just go start over someplace else.

11:54.680 --> 11:59.680
Nomadic sort of Oregon Trail method of finding a good aisle.

11:59.680 --> 12:00.680
It was so bad.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.680
Please do not be this person.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.680
You have to find another strategy.

12:04.680 --> 12:08.680
To continue a conversation that Griffin started long, long ago on this show.

12:08.680 --> 12:13.680
It is only at those points when I seriously consider just shoplifting.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.680
Mostly just to make it easier on the cashiers.

12:16.680 --> 12:17.680
Like, you know what?

12:17.680 --> 12:18.680
You're doing enough.

12:18.680 --> 12:19.680
I'm just gonna-

12:19.680 --> 12:20.680
I have this one thing.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.680
I'm just gonna take it.

12:22.680 --> 12:23.680
They're not gonna do inventory.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.680
Very consider shoplifting.

12:24.680 --> 12:25.680
Yeah.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.680
Well, especially they're going out of business.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.680
What are they gonna do with it?

12:28.680 --> 12:34.680
Going out of business and they got fucked over by the whole corporate sort of architecture of Toys R Us.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.680
And Jeffrey, he was in on it too.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.680
No.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.680
The execs got themselves a $14 million bonus.

12:41.680 --> 12:44.680
Just made sure to get themselves a little thing.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.680
A little taste.

12:45.680 --> 12:46.680
A little taste of it.

12:46.680 --> 12:52.680
Like, I mean, I think you can track it back to the fact that Toys R Us belligerently didn't open a website for about 20 years.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.680
Just like, nah.

12:53.680 --> 12:54.680
Yeah.

12:54.680 --> 12:55.680
Nah, the web's a flash in the pan.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.680
Kids are always gonna want to come into the store.

12:57.680 --> 12:58.680
And then Jeffrey did an interview.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.680
You can't ride a bike around the web.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.680
And this is from a former Toys R Us employee.

13:02.680 --> 13:07.680
If you're a Toys R Us staffer who's about to lose their gig, I fucking hear you.

13:07.680 --> 13:08.680
Listen, it's not your fault.

13:08.680 --> 13:11.680
I want you to leave that place with your head held high.

13:11.680 --> 13:12.680
You're great.

13:12.680 --> 13:16.680
If you have any training tapes there that you can steal for me, they were fucking hilarious.

13:16.680 --> 13:17.680
Yeah.

13:17.680 --> 13:18.680
You could steal some of those.

13:18.680 --> 13:19.680
That would be glorious.

13:19.680 --> 13:22.680
I mean, we know whose fault it is because Jeffrey, it wasn't Jeffrey.

13:22.680 --> 13:23.680
It was some executive in the company.

13:23.680 --> 13:29.680
But I think it's just sort of a shadow organization for Jeffrey's Dark Machinations.

13:29.680 --> 13:34.680
They did an interview where he did blame millennials for not having enough kids who buy all the toys.

13:34.680 --> 13:35.680
So thank you on that one.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.680
We made sure to get one in there right.

13:37.680 --> 13:40.680
Oh, it's three seconds left in the last round.

13:40.680 --> 13:43.680
Jeffrey comes out swinging with one last punch.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.680
At millennials for not buying enough toys.

13:45.680 --> 13:48.680
Eat my entire asshole, shithead giraffe.

13:48.680 --> 13:52.680
Especially, hey Jeffrey, millennials don't need kids to buy toys.

13:52.680 --> 13:55.680
They buy toys for themselves.

13:55.680 --> 13:56.680
Buy them like wild.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.680
Okay, Griffin, I need you to clarify something.

13:59.680 --> 14:00.680
Take me inside the bit for a second.

14:00.680 --> 14:05.680
You seem to be getting pretty worked up about an interview you imagined that Jeffrey the giraffe gave.

14:05.680 --> 14:06.680
It wasn't Jeffrey the giraffe.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.680
It wasn't Jeffrey the giraffe, like the CEO of Toys R Us or whatever actually said this.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.680
Actually said this.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.680
Said this thing.

14:12.680 --> 14:13.680
Said this dumb dumb thing.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.680
Oh, okay, now I understand.

14:15.680 --> 14:19.680
Hey, it's because your website fucking sucks and you didn't open one for a hundred years.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.680
Okay, okay, okay.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.680
Also, adult toys.

14:23.680 --> 14:24.680
Adult toys, yeah.

14:24.680 --> 14:29.680
You have Babies R Us, you have Toys R Us, how about like Sins R Us?

14:29.680 --> 14:30.680
Here are the-

14:30.680 --> 14:32.680
Don't go down that aisle, Derek.

14:32.680 --> 14:36.680
Derek, you stay away from the curtain dial, Derek.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.680
That's for Mommy and Daddy.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.680
That's Toys R Us.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.680
That's Toys number four us.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.680
And there's a bouncer.

14:45.680 --> 14:49.680
It's a person in a big Jeffrey outfit.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.680
He's got a nightstick because the kids are curious.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.680
How is this person going to spend their gift cards?

14:55.680 --> 14:57.680
I mean, you could do it very slowly.

14:57.680 --> 15:00.680
Just every time you go into the grocery store, you burn.

15:00.680 --> 15:04.680
I mean, I think you could burn three, right?

15:04.680 --> 15:08.680
And not be too much of an impediment, right?

15:08.680 --> 15:09.680
Three is fine.

15:09.680 --> 15:10.680
Three's still pretty bad.

15:10.680 --> 15:11.680
Three's still pretty bad.

15:11.680 --> 15:12.680
What if you did it like a bit?

15:12.680 --> 15:15.680
Like a magic trick where you're like, what?

15:15.680 --> 15:18.680
And just kept pulling them from different pockets all over your person?

15:18.680 --> 15:25.680
Oh my God, Travis, that would make their ramability with my shopping cart full of baby food so much higher.

15:25.680 --> 15:29.680
If you did it well, I think the cashier would enjoy it at least.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.680
How many more can there be?

15:31.680 --> 15:34.680
And then in the last one, you just look them square in the eye and say, that's it.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.680
Oh shit.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.680
You got 30 gift cards.

15:37.680 --> 15:38.680
Yes.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.680
The cashier isn't going to care.

15:40.680 --> 15:41.680
I've watched Extreme Couponing.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.680
The cashier don't give a shit.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.680
Unless they got a break coming up and that, you know, go ahead and ask.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.680
They don't care.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.680
They're leaving at five regardless.

15:50.680 --> 15:53.680
One customer, 20 customers, no skin off their nose.

15:53.680 --> 15:58.680
So the person you got to worry about like from a society point of view is the person behind you in line.

15:58.680 --> 15:59.680
Here's what you're going to do.

15:59.680 --> 16:00.680
You ready for this?

16:00.680 --> 16:07.680
You go ahead and use 10 of your gift cards, but you give the person waiting behind you one of them.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.680
There it is.

16:08.680 --> 16:13.680
You say, listen, I'm about to do something annoying, but I'm going to give you this gift card.

16:13.680 --> 16:14.680
It's five bucks.

16:14.680 --> 16:19.680
If you would just kick it with me for like five to seven minutes while I use these crazy gift cards,

16:19.680 --> 16:24.680
this wild number of gift cards I've collected, then you are also going to benefit.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.680
So like we're all going to win here.

16:26.680 --> 16:27.680
That's good.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.680
We're going to bring in their step.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.680
Oh, five bucks off?

16:30.680 --> 16:33.680
I could buy myself a whole box of Gushers or something.

16:33.680 --> 16:34.680
Sure.

16:34.680 --> 16:35.680
Gushers don't come in boxes.

16:35.680 --> 16:36.680
What you just said is wild.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.680
And the other wild thing you said.

16:38.680 --> 16:39.680
Excuse me.

16:39.680 --> 16:46.680
The six pack, 12 pack, and 20 pack of Gushers packages are all collected in one single collected box.

16:46.680 --> 16:53.680
As much as you might like up in them and just have packages of Gushers strewn about your home like some sort of pack rat,

16:53.680 --> 16:57.680
the Gushers are sold in boxes in grocery stores.

16:57.680 --> 16:58.680
That is fair.

16:58.680 --> 16:59.680
That is fair.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.680
You did say something wild and that the cashier won't care about this situation.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.680
It won't care.

17:02.680 --> 17:05.680
I don't know if you've ever seen an episode of extreme couponing.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.680
I just said that I did.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.680
I clarified while I was talking.

17:09.680 --> 17:14.680
Every episode of extreme couponing is also in secret an episode of making a murderer.

17:14.680 --> 17:19.680
Because when somebody comes to these people and says like, here's 50 coupons, get to work.

17:19.680 --> 17:23.680
This is your next hour and you are not going to know how to handle this situation.

17:23.680 --> 17:27.680
And you are definitely going to think that I am fucking taking the house on this one.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.680
And that you will definitely get fired if you scan in the wrong shit.

17:30.680 --> 17:34.680
And that you will definitely get fired because you have given me all this toilet paper for free.

17:34.680 --> 17:41.680
The look in those people's eyes is one of just like, it's just complete murder.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.680
Just absolute murder.

17:42.680 --> 17:51.680
So you have to find a way to maybe, first of all, let's talk about the science of these cards.

17:51.680 --> 18:00.680
If you just rub them all together real hard, does the money go from one to the other?

18:00.680 --> 18:01.680
Probably not, right?

18:01.680 --> 18:03.680
Well, you don't know until you try, Griffin.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.680
Or what if you tape them all together?

18:05.680 --> 18:08.680
Tape them all together, try to swipe them all through once.

18:08.680 --> 18:14.680
I mean, I think this is what Bitcoin actually is.

18:14.680 --> 18:22.680
Is there some way for you to slide it through a dongle and now it's Bitcoin?

18:22.680 --> 18:25.680
And then you take the Bitcoin to the Sam's Club?

18:25.680 --> 18:29.680
Can you use Bitcoin at Sam's Club?

18:29.680 --> 18:30.680
They love it.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.680
Yeah, they love their cryptocurrencies.

18:32.680 --> 18:36.680
Yeah, I mean, you could just also go there.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.680
I don't like to use cryptocurrency because it seems too spooky to me.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.680
Yeah, it is very spooky.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.680
I don't know anything about it except it's got crypt in there.

18:44.680 --> 18:49.680
Yeah, I mean, they're covered in cobwebs and spiders and each one has a little ghoul inside of it.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.680
I don't fuck with that.

18:51.680 --> 18:57.680
But can you go to a store right when it opens and say, here's $35 gift cards.

18:57.680 --> 19:01.680
I would like to use these to purchase one $150 gift card.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.680
Ooh.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.680
And then you're done, then you're free.

19:05.680 --> 19:10.680
It's going to be a bad morning, and don't get me wrong, it will take an entire morning, 9 to noon.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.680
And maybe you give a few to the employee.

19:14.680 --> 19:17.680
That's insulting, I feel like, maybe.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.680
You got to throw them away.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.680
It is not worth it.

19:22.680 --> 19:26.680
There's no suggestion we can give you that it's better than throwing them in the garbage.

19:26.680 --> 19:32.680
Or melt them into some kind of beautiful statue and just know that it is inherently worth $150.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.680
Oh, yeah.

19:34.680 --> 19:38.680
And it's a protest statue against the Toys R Us.

19:38.680 --> 19:42.680
And it's the giraffe, but he looks like a big idiot.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.680
Morgan Davey sent in this Yahoo, keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.680
It's Yahoo Answers user Carol who asks,

19:48.680 --> 19:54.680
How come Dorothy's dress never got dirty all the way to Oz?

19:54.680 --> 19:56.680
Huh.

19:56.680 --> 19:59.680
Got some answers on this one, but it's an interesting concept.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.680
This is a young woman.

20:02.680 --> 20:05.680
Lives on a farm, should have been dirty before the whole thing.

20:05.680 --> 20:09.680
Before this whole zany, improbable adventure even got started.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.680
Also got caught up in a tornado in Kansas.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.680
That's dusty work, friends.

20:14.680 --> 20:20.680
She should have been just sort of coated in a thin layer of grime before she even rolled up.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.680
And then the scarecrow would have been like,

20:22.680 --> 20:28.680
Whoa, my brain, or whoa, you got a little dirt on you.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.680
You cool or what's going on?

20:30.680 --> 20:35.680
But then certainly as she traipsed through the poppy fields and,

20:35.680 --> 20:43.680
you know, the dirt zone, the dirt village and muddy swamp.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.680
And the candy cane forest.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.680
The candy cane forest.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.680
Can you imagine the candy cane forest?

20:51.680 --> 20:53.680
The debris on one of those candy canes.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.680
Don't drop lane.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.680
You don't actually see the monkeys hurling their own feces,

20:58.680 --> 21:00.680
but we do have to assume.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.680
It's implied.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.680
I think by the time she shows up to the Emerald City,

21:04.680 --> 21:11.680
her and her squad of companions should just be yucky.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.680
Well, they are.

21:13.680 --> 21:14.680
I'm sorry.

21:14.680 --> 21:15.680
I have to save us from tweets.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.680
They are.

21:16.680 --> 21:19.680
They go through a whole cleanup process at the Emerald City.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.680
There's wash, wash, wash, scrub, scrub, scrub.

21:22.680 --> 21:28.680
It's true, there aren't a lot of movies where our characters arrive

21:28.680 --> 21:31.680
at the paradise that they've been pursuing,

21:31.680 --> 21:33.680
and the very first thing that has to happen is like,

21:33.680 --> 21:35.680
y'all stink like shit.

21:35.680 --> 21:38.680
You cannot even be in our whole thing right now.

21:38.680 --> 21:39.680
Ew, gross.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.680
Yeah, you're so disgusting.

21:41.680 --> 21:45.680
Oh, hey, this is Utopia, and you all are doo-doo.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.680
Yeah, you're like, can we talk to the, you can talk to no one.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.680
You can talk to this brush.

21:50.680 --> 21:53.680
Open up, because you are so wack right now.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.680
I can taste your sweat.

21:55.680 --> 21:58.680
You have been walking through this wonderland for days,

21:58.680 --> 22:02.680
and I can taste the sweat on you, and on the Tin Man, which is wild.

22:02.680 --> 22:06.680
Did trees throw apples at you, and then maybe some monkey shit on you?

22:06.680 --> 22:07.680
What are you doing?

22:07.680 --> 22:10.680
What are you doing here, Dorothy?

22:10.680 --> 22:14.680
I love the Lord of the Rings movies for so many reasons.

22:14.680 --> 22:19.680
Also, just looking at Orlando Bloom puts me at ease.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.680
They're so long.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.680
They're very long, and you get a lot of...

22:22.680 --> 22:24.680
One of the best snaps I ever had.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.680
A lot of bloom out of those features.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.680
That's not to say the Lord of the Rings movies are boring.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.680
Just one time I went to a late night showing,

22:30.680 --> 22:32.680
I fell asleep in the middle of the first one.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.680
It was the third time I'd seen it.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.680
And I fell asleep, and I slept so good.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.680
But here's what I love.

22:38.680 --> 22:42.680
Into the trilogy, climbing Mount Doom,

22:42.680 --> 22:47.680
little Samji and Frodo.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.680
Samji and Frodo.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.680
Samji and Frodo.

22:51.680 --> 22:53.680
These two boys are so fucking nasty.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.680
Do you remember?

22:55.680 --> 22:59.680
Covered in grime and stink, and I can feel the stink through the film,

22:59.680 --> 23:01.680
through the celluloid.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.680
I know these boys reek, and I know they're fucking filthy pigs.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.680
And I love it, because it's like, now that's fantasy.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.680
Now I'm taken away.

23:10.680 --> 23:15.680
They would get filthy, nasty, dirty, eating raw fish with their friend Gollum.

23:15.680 --> 23:19.680
Filthy, stinky, gross pustules of boys.

23:19.680 --> 23:21.680
Stinky, gross, nasty pigs.

23:21.680 --> 23:23.680
And I love that.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.680
And I love it.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.680
Orlando Bloom, they never get him dirty.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.680
And I also think that's a good creative choice from Peter Jackson,

23:29.680 --> 23:31.680
because I think they did put the stink makeup on him.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.680
And Peter Jackson was like,

23:33.680 --> 23:35.680
nobody's going to fucking believe this.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.680
I want that actually in every movie.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.680
The effect that they do in Lord of the Rings,

23:39.680 --> 23:43.680
they cut between dirty ranger man and then the elves.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.680
And the elves are glowing.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.680
They are transcendent.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.680
And it cuts back to dirty man.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.680
And then it's like,

23:51.680 --> 23:55.680
just very clearly, this person has not been stinking themselves up

23:55.680 --> 23:57.680
for the last 24 hours.

23:57.680 --> 24:01.680
There's no way to communicate the stink through the film.

24:01.680 --> 24:05.680
And I think that smell-o-vision is a bad joke.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.680
And I think that stink lines,

24:07.680 --> 24:11.680
we reference that in virtually every episode of every podcast we do.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.680
There's a filter, like just a brown filter.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.680
Oh, a stink.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.680
Well, the whole movie kind of has a stink filter on it already.

24:17.680 --> 24:21.680
Gandalf stunk so fucking bad,

24:21.680 --> 24:25.680
that in order to communicate it, they had to kill him.

24:25.680 --> 24:27.680
And then change his name.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.680
They're like, hey, it's Gandalf the Great.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.680
Don't call me by my stink name.

24:31.680 --> 24:35.680
I have a new clean boy name that I want you to call me by.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.680
Gandalf the White, because I smell great,

24:37.680 --> 24:39.680
and I'm not filthy anymore.

24:39.680 --> 24:43.680
It's kind of how much that dude stank from his tobacco smoke.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.680
And his big fight with the fireman.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.680
Adventure dirt.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.680
Don't you always think by the end of a James Bond movie,

24:49.680 --> 24:51.680
James Bond probably smells like shit, right?

24:51.680 --> 24:53.680
It fucking stinks.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.680
Absolutely.

24:55.680 --> 24:57.680
So many of these characters, don't get me wrong,

24:57.680 --> 24:59.680
he probably still has a hint of aftershave

24:59.680 --> 25:01.680
and deodorant and cologne and stuff.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.680
But also, he's been tied up.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.680
He's been sweating.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.680
He's been fighting people in the mud and dirt and stuff.

25:07.680 --> 25:11.680
He probably, underneath his veneer of grooming,

25:11.680 --> 25:13.680
stinks like shit.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.680
Let me hit you guys with this.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.680
I just had a killer idea.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.680
The McElroy Brothers movie UI.

25:19.680 --> 25:23.680
And this is a UI that we will put onto movies.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.680
And not as like a fun thing that you get

25:25.680 --> 25:27.680
and you download it and you listen to it later,

25:27.680 --> 25:29.680
like riff tracks.

25:29.680 --> 25:31.680
I'm talking about this is baked into the cinematic release.

25:31.680 --> 25:35.680
And it shows a stink meter on the screen

25:35.680 --> 25:37.680
as they go along.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.680
And we could do this with other stuff, too.

25:39.680 --> 25:41.680
You can drop it back down if there's a scene of them

25:41.680 --> 25:43.680
washing their hands.

25:43.680 --> 25:45.680
On that scene, that always happens where it's like,

25:45.680 --> 25:47.680
oh, I'm so stressed out by these terrorists or whatever.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.680
And they go splash water in their face.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.680
It just drops down like five percent.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.680
The stink meter goes down a little bit.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.680
And then we can have kind of pop-up video

25:55.680 --> 25:57.680
implied between these two scenes.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.680
They change clothes.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.680
And that, or in The Lord of the Rings.

26:01.680 --> 26:05.680
These two boys are climbing up the mountain

26:05.680 --> 26:09.680
and they're crying because they love each other so much.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.680
And their stink meter is all the way full.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.680
And imagine the...

26:13.680 --> 26:15.680
Sorry.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.680
I'm getting choked up thinking about it.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.680
The emotional impact.

26:19.680 --> 26:21.680
Knowing these boys stink so bad.

26:21.680 --> 26:25.680
And the journey they've gone through together.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.680
And the way they support each other.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.680
It's powerful.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.680
And they still hug even though they stink

26:31.680 --> 26:33.680
like eight kinds of shit.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.680
I think that would make the end of Die Hard

26:35.680 --> 26:37.680
even more sort of moving.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.680
Because if you watch Die Hard,

26:39.680 --> 26:41.680
before Hans Gruber even hits the ground,

26:41.680 --> 26:45.680
Holly basically is like enveloped John McClane

26:45.680 --> 26:47.680
in the most passionate embrace.

26:47.680 --> 26:51.680
This motherfucker has been crawling around

26:51.680 --> 26:53.680
a dirty building, bleeding everywhere.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.680
In the red.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.680
His tank top literally goes from white to like green.

26:57.680 --> 26:59.680
It goes from white to like green

26:59.680 --> 27:01.680
by the end of the movie.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.680
It is kind of the first stink meter.

27:03.680 --> 27:05.680
It's his tank top in that movie.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.680
It's like a lit mist has to stink like shit.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.680
There's just no...

27:09.680 --> 27:13.680
The only movie I've ever seen actually...

27:13.680 --> 27:15.680
The Jerk deals with this.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.680
I guess a little bit.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.680
When Bernadette Peters reunites with Steve Martin,

27:19.680 --> 27:21.680
she tells him he fucking stinks.

27:21.680 --> 27:23.680
And he needs to go sit in a different car.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.680
Thank you. Thank you Bernadette.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.680
Thank you for being brave enough.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.680
And then you watch a movie like Hope Flows.

27:29.680 --> 27:33.680
And that stink meter never really...

27:33.680 --> 27:35.680
What if it started off high?

27:35.680 --> 27:37.680
And you're like, oh it turns out this whole time

27:37.680 --> 27:39.680
Harry Connors Jr.'s character stank like shit

27:39.680 --> 27:41.680
from the beginning of the movie on.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.680
I think it's just low the whole time,

27:43.680 --> 27:45.680
but it is there letting you know

27:45.680 --> 27:47.680
these characters do not stink.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.680
What about if like in phenomenon, right?

27:49.680 --> 27:51.680
Like, oh it's amazing.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.680
John Travolta's character can like levitate stuff.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.680
He does stink like doo doo.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.680
And it's just things that we don't know.

27:57.680 --> 28:01.680
Things we never knew about the characters

28:01.680 --> 28:03.680
that gives them a much richer story.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.680
And then we can do this with all kinds of meters.

28:05.680 --> 28:07.680
We can have full blown Sims moodlets on the screen

28:07.680 --> 28:09.680
where it's just like a horny meter.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.680
And that one's going up and you're like,

28:11.680 --> 28:13.680
uh oh, here comes, here comes, here comes.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.680
And hungry meter.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.680
Hey, why is Hans Gruber being such a dick?

28:17.680 --> 28:19.680
Oh, he's hungry.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.680
You see John McClane shoot three guys

28:21.680 --> 28:23.680
and his horny meter goes up and it's like, damn, John.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.680
Whoa.

28:25.680 --> 28:27.680
Hey, Johnny.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.680
He's climbing through the vents and you're like,

28:29.680 --> 28:31.680
oh man, this seems really scary.

28:31.680 --> 28:33.680
But his horny meter's off the charts.

28:33.680 --> 28:35.680
And it's like being in the small vent

28:35.680 --> 28:37.680
makes you very horny, John.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.680
Oh no, Gruber's going to kill Ellis.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.680
John? Hey, John, what's up, dude?

28:41.680 --> 28:43.680
Oh, dude.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.680
I shot a kid.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.680
Whoa.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.680
His hog is wild right now.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.680
Oh no.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.680
As Hans Gruber is just

28:53.680 --> 28:55.680
falling to his death, it's just getting

28:55.680 --> 28:57.680
higher and higher and higher.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.680
It catches him.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.680
Like, I was the kid.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.680
That's why I did all of it.

29:03.680 --> 29:05.680
It turned out.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.680
Hans Gruber hits the horny meter on his way down

29:07.680 --> 29:09.680
and bounces off.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.680
That's so great.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.680
Oh my god, we can include this in every film.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.680
And then Die Hard 8,

29:15.680 --> 29:17.680
he's fucking tied to a chair or whatever

29:17.680 --> 29:19.680
with a room full of bad guys.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.680
And he's like, you're outnumbered.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.680
And he breaks the ropes.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.680
And I'm like, okay, you broke the ropes, now what?

29:25.680 --> 29:27.680
And he reaches down and he grabs the horny meter

29:27.680 --> 29:29.680
in one hand and the stink meter in the other hand

29:29.680 --> 29:31.680
and he kills them all with it.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.680
You can do that once

29:33.680 --> 29:35.680
in Hot Sharts Part 3.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.680
In the scary movie 13.

29:37.680 --> 29:39.680
You can do it once before the whole convention

29:39.680 --> 29:41.680
is like, yeah, we get it.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.680
We've seen that before.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.680
Fuck.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.680
Let's take a quick break right now

29:47.680 --> 29:49.680
to hear from our sponsors

29:49.680 --> 29:51.680
in a little segment we like to call

29:51.680 --> 29:53.680
The Money Zone.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.680
Hey, I want to tell everybody about Blue Apron

30:05.680 --> 30:07.680
if you wouldn't mind me talking about Blue Apron for a little bit.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.680
Yeah.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.680
They're really cool.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.680
They deliver you boxes and the boxes got stuff in them

30:13.680 --> 30:15.680
and I've used it for a while

30:15.680 --> 30:17.680
and it taught me how to cook

30:17.680 --> 30:19.680
and that's a very valuable skill that I treasure

30:19.680 --> 30:21.680
and so I treasure Blue Apron

30:21.680 --> 30:23.680
and the meals are very, very tasty

30:23.680 --> 30:25.680
and I like it just a lot.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.680
You open a beach box and it's like, what's even in here?

30:27.680 --> 30:29.680
I don't know.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.680
Except you do know because you can pick it

30:31.680 --> 30:33.680
from a list of recipe options.

30:33.680 --> 30:35.680
But anyway, they're the leading

30:35.680 --> 30:37.680
meal kit delivery service in the US.

30:37.680 --> 30:39.680
They've got incredible ingredients and chef designed recipes

30:39.680 --> 30:41.680
like quick bucatini with broccoli

30:41.680 --> 30:43.680
and chorino cheese and Italian style shrimp

30:43.680 --> 30:45.680
and sweet pepper.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.680
They let you see what the power of food can do.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.680
They got fresh, non-GMO, pre-portioned ingredients

30:49.680 --> 30:51.680
and step-by-step recipes.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.680
They deliver right to your door and can be cooked in under 45 minutes.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.680
and all the recipes are designed by Blue Apron's

30:59.680 --> 31:01.680
in-house culinary team.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.680
They are treating my brother, my brother, and me

31:11.680 --> 31:13.680
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.680
I was gonna make a joke about like what's in the box

31:15.680 --> 31:17.680
and then I started thinking about the stink meter

31:17.680 --> 31:19.680
on 7.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.680
Oh my god. Oh come on.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.680
It'd be off the charts.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.680
They would need a second stink meter.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.680
It would be like stink meter and then right below that

31:27.680 --> 31:29.680
just be like, I don't know guys, it was too big.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.680
The limit break stink meter.

31:31.680 --> 31:33.680
Limit break, yeah.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.680
Some did an omni slash of the stink.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.680
I wanna tell you about stamps.com.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.680
mundane. Yes. Then join us for

32:41.680 --> 32:43.680
a bit of the arcane. Whoa.

32:43.680 --> 32:45.680
The mundane and the arcane

32:45.680 --> 32:47.680
is a homebrew D&D 5E

32:47.680 --> 32:49.680
podcast focused on

32:49.680 --> 32:51.680
expansive world building, intensive role playing

32:51.680 --> 32:53.680
and very good puns. Now I hear what

32:53.680 --> 32:55.680
you're thinking. Blah.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.680
But trust me, maybe it'll

32:57.680 --> 32:59.680
be good. Have your imagination tickle

32:59.680 --> 33:01.680
by a tickle dungeon minstrel.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.680
That was fucking whack dude.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.680
Clever girls and troublesome twins with

33:05.680 --> 33:07.680
sticky fingers. No the joke

33:07.680 --> 33:09.680
there was that we

33:09.680 --> 33:11.680
also do one of these. What? Yeah.

33:11.680 --> 33:13.680
We used to. We used to

33:13.680 --> 33:15.680
do a D&D podcast. But I'm

33:15.680 --> 33:17.680
saying that was the joke. It was like

33:17.680 --> 33:19.680
because we used to do one. Oh.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.680
You know what I mean? It wasn't a great joke but

33:21.680 --> 33:23.680
there'll be better ones on the mundane

33:23.680 --> 33:25.680
and the arcane. Would you find anywhere

33:25.680 --> 33:27.680
that you find fine podcasts?

33:27.680 --> 33:29.680
They come out every

33:29.680 --> 33:31.680
other Wednesday. Do they?

33:31.680 --> 33:33.680
They do. It says it here.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.680
Geez you swinging a miss bud.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.680
Our boy is sickly.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.680
I know. I'm trying to. I'm

33:39.680 --> 33:41.680
hanging in there. Give me another shot. Please put

33:41.680 --> 33:43.680
me in coach. No I'm going to read this next one.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.680
I don't trust you anymore. This is Jumbotron.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.680
It was for Anna Whiteside

33:47.680 --> 33:49.680
and Michael Watson.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.680
And it's from Loretta and

33:51.680 --> 33:53.680
Atticus who say Meow Meow

33:53.680 --> 33:55.680
Meow. Meow Meow.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.680
And there's a translation here but I don't

33:57.680 --> 33:59.680
think we need to read it because I feel like folks really

33:59.680 --> 34:01.680
sort of got the nug of that one.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.680
But I'll do it anyway. Translation.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.680
Happy two year wedding anniversary

34:05.680 --> 34:07.680
and thank you for feeding us so much.

34:07.680 --> 34:09.680
We are both overweight. Now here's the weird thing.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.680
Loretta and Atticus are their kids.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.680
Yeah. They're feral.

34:13.680 --> 34:15.680
No these are two kitties.

34:15.680 --> 34:17.680
And I think

34:17.680 --> 34:19.680
these kitties are

34:19.680 --> 34:21.680
beautiful and I think

34:21.680 --> 34:23.680
love the skin you're in. Or the fur

34:23.680 --> 34:25.680
that you're in. And that's all I have to say about that.

34:25.680 --> 34:27.680
Skin and cats Griffin.

34:27.680 --> 34:29.680
You're the one who did that so. What?

34:29.680 --> 34:31.680
There's a message. The next message is

34:31.680 --> 34:33.680
from Kelly and it's from Maureen.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.680
It's not from both of them

34:35.680 --> 34:37.680
so it's two one

34:37.680 --> 34:39.680
We are really firing on all

34:39.680 --> 34:41.680
Don't say we. Don't say we. I'm bringing

34:41.680 --> 34:43.680
my fucking A game

34:43.680 --> 34:45.680
100 percent batting average

34:45.680 --> 34:47.680
and you two are just dropping the ball.

34:47.680 --> 34:49.680
Do you want to start the episode over again?

34:49.680 --> 34:51.680
I'm Emile's brother. This is

34:51.680 --> 34:53.680
for Maureen.

34:53.680 --> 34:55.680
It's from

34:55.680 --> 34:57.680
Kelly.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.680
Hello beautiful. Happy two year

34:59.680 --> 35:01.680
anniversary. I'm so lucky

35:01.680 --> 35:03.680
to be your girlfriend. I wouldn't

35:03.680 --> 35:05.680
trade a moment of our time together.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.680
Thanks for putting up with my haunted

35:07.680 --> 35:09.680
doll collection. It's hard to believe

35:09.680 --> 35:11.680
that by the time the brothers read this

35:11.680 --> 35:13.680
we'll have seen them in person at least

35:13.680 --> 35:15.680
once. Lots of love

35:15.680 --> 35:17.680
Kelly.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.680
LOL.

35:19.680 --> 35:21.680
You say you wouldn't trade a moment of your time together. That's fine.

35:21.680 --> 35:23.680
But what about for these

35:23.680 --> 35:25.680
eight rubies?

35:25.680 --> 35:27.680
And I hold out eight magic

35:27.680 --> 35:29.680
rubies. Not

35:29.680 --> 35:31.680
the magical rubies Griffin. That's our family's

35:31.680 --> 35:33.680
inheritance. I will

35:33.680 --> 35:35.680
take your most precious day.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.680
It shall be mine.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.680
Taste the rubies.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.680
They're real. They're skittles.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.680
Tastes like rubies, don't it?

35:47.680 --> 35:49.680
My name is Adam and I love Storybreak.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.680
I'm Megan and I love My Bim Bam.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.680
What really first got me into the show

35:53.680 --> 35:55.680
was the idea of creating

35:55.680 --> 35:57.680
a whole story out of a very simple concept.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.680
I super love haunted

35:59.680 --> 36:01.680
doll watch. I just want to see what they come up

36:01.680 --> 36:03.680
with next. I realized I was

36:03.680 --> 36:05.680
listening to almost every podcast you guys

36:05.680 --> 36:07.680
put out. But when I realized I was

36:07.680 --> 36:09.680
consuming almost everything you produced

36:09.680 --> 36:11.680
I felt that it was like unfair of me

36:11.680 --> 36:13.680
not to give you something because you

36:13.680 --> 36:15.680
were giving me so much. Honestly

36:15.680 --> 36:17.680
Maximum Fun, they get me through my work week.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.680
It makes me laugh every day nearly getting

36:19.680 --> 36:21.680
several cries.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.680
That's

36:23.680 --> 36:25.680
on me. These are listeners

36:25.680 --> 36:27.680
just like you and they support Storybreak

36:27.680 --> 36:29.680
and my brother, my brother and me with a Max Fun

36:29.680 --> 36:31.680
membership. The 2018

36:31.680 --> 36:33.680
Max Fun Drive is April 2nd through 13th

36:33.680 --> 36:35.680
and if you want to support your favorite shows

36:35.680 --> 36:37.680
too it is the best time to

36:37.680 --> 36:39.680
sign up or upgrade your membership.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.680
Just tune in starting April 2nd and we'll give you

36:41.680 --> 36:43.680
all the details.

36:43.680 --> 36:47.680
Here's another question.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.680
I

36:49.680 --> 36:51.680
only did one question last time.

36:51.680 --> 36:53.680
Well we talked a long time about

36:53.680 --> 36:55.680
the stink UI on movies.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.680
Well I'm going to stop

36:57.680 --> 36:59.680
feeling bad about stuff like that because honestly

36:59.680 --> 37:01.680
that's valuable.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.680
That's valuable.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.680
That's where our

37:05.680 --> 37:07.680
profits are going to come from.

37:07.680 --> 37:09.680
Do you know what I'm saying?

37:09.680 --> 37:11.680
That's something. Are you talking about

37:11.680 --> 37:13.680
like our question to minute ratio?

37:13.680 --> 37:15.680
We need to get that as low as

37:15.680 --> 37:17.680
possible. That's where the profit comes from?

37:17.680 --> 37:19.680
Because we're only spending money on one or two

37:19.680 --> 37:21.680
questions an episode now.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.680
You know it's got low overhead.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.680
Yes. Like those

37:25.680 --> 37:27.680
we have to pay so much for

37:27.680 --> 37:29.680
and the fewer we use

37:29.680 --> 37:31.680
the better it is.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.680
I work at a job where I'm often

37:33.680 --> 37:35.680
traveling for long periods of time with my

37:35.680 --> 37:37.680
boss in the car. I'm not a chatty

37:37.680 --> 37:39.680
guy so this often means long stretches

37:39.680 --> 37:41.680
of time where we sit in silence.

37:41.680 --> 37:43.680
I'm actually okay with this but I still feel like

37:43.680 --> 37:45.680
I should probably do something about it.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.680
How can I make our drives more interesting

37:47.680 --> 37:49.680
without jeopardizing my career?

37:49.680 --> 37:51.680
That's from Taciturn in transit.

37:51.680 --> 37:53.680
Well maybe there's something you could both

37:53.680 --> 37:55.680
listen to that you would enjoy

37:55.680 --> 37:57.680
both sharing and enjoying.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.680
This is literally it.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.680
This is why we do what we do.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.680
This is why we do the thing we do.

38:03.680 --> 38:05.680
Are you talking about like a book on tape?

38:05.680 --> 38:07.680
No. No. I'm not.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.680
I'm talking about like Star Trek novels.

38:09.680 --> 38:11.680
There's one I think all about the Q-contemnum

38:11.680 --> 38:13.680
that Dad made us listen to once.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.680
Sorry can you just say that word one more time?

38:15.680 --> 38:17.680
The Q-contemnum.

38:17.680 --> 38:19.680
Laughter

38:19.680 --> 38:21.680
You know.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.680
Yeah. There's the Red Rising series.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.680
The new one of those. Iron Gold

38:25.680 --> 38:27.680
just popped off. Fourth one in that series.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.680
It's great. They got four different

38:29.680 --> 38:31.680
sort of narratives. No! Podcasts!

38:31.680 --> 38:33.680
Just get a podcast and listen to it.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.680
Find some shared interest

38:35.680 --> 38:37.680
and enjoy it together.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.680
And then afterwards you make a little conversation about it.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.680
It's possible though. It's why we do what we do.

38:41.680 --> 38:43.680
I take this very personally.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.680
Getting people out of

38:45.680 --> 38:47.680
conversations is the main

38:47.680 --> 38:49.680
thing that we do. Whether it's a conversation

38:49.680 --> 38:51.680
that you will have with yourself in your

38:51.680 --> 38:53.680
brain and can't stop having no matter what

38:53.680 --> 38:55.680
or a conversation that you have with someone else

38:55.680 --> 38:57.680
we are there to have the conversation

38:57.680 --> 38:59.680
for you so you don't have to do the heavy lifting.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.680
That is why we are here every single week

39:01.680 --> 39:03.680
for you to avoid

39:03.680 --> 39:05.680
chatting. But this is the question.

39:05.680 --> 39:07.680
The question I have is when you say sit in silence

39:07.680 --> 39:09.680
do you mean literally?

39:09.680 --> 39:11.680
Do you like no music

39:11.680 --> 39:13.680
no podcast

39:13.680 --> 39:15.680
nothing on? Or you just mean that's

39:15.680 --> 39:17.680
going and you feel like you should be talking?

39:17.680 --> 39:19.680
Because you are worried

39:19.680 --> 39:21.680
about nothing. If music or

39:21.680 --> 39:23.680
a podcast or something is playing

39:23.680 --> 39:25.680
that's what you do.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.680
You say music but is there

39:27.680 --> 39:29.680
anything? Nothing.

39:29.680 --> 39:31.680
Anything more touch and go

39:31.680 --> 39:33.680
than when you get into

39:33.680 --> 39:35.680
somebody else's car and they are like

39:35.680 --> 39:37.680
I'm going to turn on some tunes.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.680
In that moment I am suspended

39:39.680 --> 39:41.680
in the fear dimension

39:41.680 --> 39:43.680
because I don't know what the fuck they are

39:43.680 --> 39:45.680
going to put on. No way.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.680
It ain't going to be my music.

39:47.680 --> 39:49.680
The inverse is maybe

39:49.680 --> 39:51.680
the fear dimension inside

39:51.680 --> 39:53.680
the fear dimension. It is the sunken place

39:53.680 --> 39:55.680
of just like hey put something

39:55.680 --> 39:57.680
on and it's like

39:57.680 --> 39:59.680
do you like chip

39:59.680 --> 40:01.680
tunes?

40:01.680 --> 40:03.680
And not only that

40:03.680 --> 40:05.680
I also guess that when it comes down to it

40:05.680 --> 40:07.680
listening to music is rarely a

40:07.680 --> 40:09.680
like passive thing.

40:09.680 --> 40:11.680
It becomes performative so

40:11.680 --> 40:13.680
quickly of like I

40:13.680 --> 40:15.680
am enjoying, see how much I am enjoying

40:15.680 --> 40:17.680
this. I have

40:17.680 --> 40:19.680
a friend named Badkins and

40:19.680 --> 40:21.680
I remember distinctly he was at

40:21.680 --> 40:23.680
our place in Chicago when I was living there

40:23.680 --> 40:25.680
just visiting and he was like

40:25.680 --> 40:27.680
my roommate had a record player with like

40:27.680 --> 40:29.680
an AV hookup and I had my

40:29.680 --> 40:31.680
iPod or whatever plugged in

40:31.680 --> 40:33.680
and he was like hey play something. And I was like

40:33.680 --> 40:35.680
okay my friend Badkins is kind of a music

40:35.680 --> 40:37.680
aficionado. Let's see what I should put

40:37.680 --> 40:39.680
on. And I put on what I was most recently listening to

40:39.680 --> 40:41.680
which I think was one of those old team

40:41.680 --> 40:43.680
teamwork mashups. He takes like

40:43.680 --> 40:45.680
cool game music and then

40:45.680 --> 40:47.680
puts like hip hop and

40:47.680 --> 40:49.680
stuff over it.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.680
And I put it on and he was like ah

40:51.680 --> 40:53.680
this stinks. And I was like this is

40:53.680 --> 40:55.680
the first time that I have ever been like

40:55.680 --> 40:57.680
in a situation where somebody is like hey put

40:57.680 --> 40:59.680
on some music. I put something on and they were instantly

40:59.680 --> 41:01.680
like you picked, you chose wrong.

41:01.680 --> 41:03.680
You picked wrong. This is

41:03.680 --> 41:05.680
bad music.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.680
The first time I ever went on, and this is

41:07.680 --> 41:09.680
more about

41:09.680 --> 41:11.680
us than the Smurls really

41:11.680 --> 41:13.680
but the first time I ever went

41:13.680 --> 41:15.680
on a road trip with them they

41:15.680 --> 41:17.680
didn't turn on

41:17.680 --> 41:19.680
the radio

41:19.680 --> 41:21.680
because they

41:21.680 --> 41:23.680
were, and it

41:23.680 --> 41:25.680
took me a while to understand

41:25.680 --> 41:27.680
like why

41:27.680 --> 41:29.680
no one turned on the radio

41:29.680 --> 41:31.680
literally before

41:31.680 --> 41:33.680
you pull out of the driveway

41:33.680 --> 41:35.680
or engage the parking

41:35.680 --> 41:37.680
brake or anything. Like you just disengage

41:37.680 --> 41:39.680
the parking brake. You just turn on the

41:39.680 --> 41:41.680
radio. Nothing. Like they didn't turn

41:41.680 --> 41:43.680
it on at all.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.680
And eventually I realized I looked around in sort of

41:45.680 --> 41:47.680
dawning horror as they continued to

41:47.680 --> 41:49.680
chat idly and not

41:49.680 --> 41:51.680
turn on the radio that the plan

41:51.680 --> 41:53.680
was to

41:53.680 --> 41:55.680
chat idly.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.680
For the entirety

41:57.680 --> 41:59.680
of the journey.

41:59.680 --> 42:01.680
Where's the buffer? Where's the buffers?

42:01.680 --> 42:03.680
Where's the buffet?

42:03.680 --> 42:05.680
I mean anything.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.680
I gotta have my tunes man. How am I supposed to

42:07.680 --> 42:09.680
jam back here?

42:09.680 --> 42:11.680
Maybe this is about us because like

42:11.680 --> 42:13.680
even now when Teresa and I get in the

42:13.680 --> 42:15.680
car, even if we're going somewhere five

42:15.680 --> 42:17.680
minutes away, I won't

42:17.680 --> 42:19.680
move the car until like a podcast

42:19.680 --> 42:21.680
is playing our music or something and

42:21.680 --> 42:23.680
she's like we're going to be there in five minutes.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.680
And I'm like yes that is five minutes of

42:25.680 --> 42:27.680
my life. That is five

42:27.680 --> 42:29.680
minutes of crushing

42:29.680 --> 42:31.680
nothingness.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.680
Music's my soul dude.

42:33.680 --> 42:35.680
I've been thinking about it. Music's my fucking

42:35.680 --> 42:37.680
heart and my soul. Thank you.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.680
I live

42:39.680 --> 42:41.680
for the tunes.

42:41.680 --> 42:43.680
I just like podcasts I guess.

42:43.680 --> 42:45.680
I've been re-listening to Magic Tavern

42:45.680 --> 42:47.680
starting at the beginning.

42:47.680 --> 42:49.680
I mean like a week of 75 episodes in

42:49.680 --> 42:51.680
and that drive time, hey that drive

42:51.680 --> 42:53.680
time, that's time when I can be

42:53.680 --> 42:55.680
accomplishing my listening goals.

42:55.680 --> 42:57.680
You know? Thank you.

42:57.680 --> 42:59.680
That's time for me.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.680
They can buy a fucking Jumbotron.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.680
There's much free advertisement on YouTube.

43:03.680 --> 43:05.680
Well I was on an episode of it.

43:05.680 --> 43:07.680
Here's a yahoo.

43:07.680 --> 43:09.680
Here's a yahoo sent in by Lauren McGregor.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.680
And if this is too similar to one we did

43:11.680 --> 43:13.680
last week please just let me know. I can't

43:13.680 --> 43:15.680
remember last week's episode. Okay yahoo

43:15.680 --> 43:17.680
answers user Brianna asks,

43:17.680 --> 43:19.680
how did the person that invented the microscope

43:19.680 --> 43:21.680
think of the microscope?

43:23.680 --> 43:25.680
Whoa. We had the one last week that was

43:25.680 --> 43:27.680
how did the person who invented the clock know what time

43:27.680 --> 43:29.680
it was? And I'm just so curious

43:29.680 --> 43:31.680
I guess about inventions.

43:31.680 --> 43:33.680
And this one really drills down into it.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.680
In that somebody invented a microscope

43:35.680 --> 43:37.680
and then. It's like they looked at something

43:37.680 --> 43:39.680
and thought I want to see that bigger

43:39.680 --> 43:41.680
but I'm not going to move my head closer.

43:41.680 --> 43:43.680
Yeah it's like somebody made a telescope

43:43.680 --> 43:45.680
and they were like this lets you look

43:45.680 --> 43:47.680
up at the stars but it makes them

43:47.680 --> 43:49.680
real big in your eye. And you're like

43:49.680 --> 43:51.680
well I want to do that for

43:51.680 --> 43:53.680
my blood.

43:53.680 --> 43:55.680
What I assume is that

43:55.680 --> 43:57.680
they got

43:57.680 --> 43:59.680
a telescope

43:59.680 --> 44:01.680
and they're like this looks at big

44:01.680 --> 44:03.680
stuff that's far away. And the

44:03.680 --> 44:05.680
they looked at a slide

44:05.680 --> 44:07.680
that they had prepared. And

44:07.680 --> 44:09.680
why did someone know how to prepare a slide before the invention

44:09.680 --> 44:11.680
of microscopes?

44:11.680 --> 44:13.680
Don't worry about it. So they

44:13.680 --> 44:15.680
just got the telescope and they turned it upside down

44:15.680 --> 44:17.680
and then they looked at it and they

44:17.680 --> 44:19.680
were like well this is

44:19.680 --> 44:21.680
this is nothing. And nothing happened

44:21.680 --> 44:23.680
but they were like but there's something like

44:23.680 --> 44:25.680
this that we could

44:25.680 --> 44:27.680
definitely make work. But they had to

44:27.680 --> 44:29.680
know that there was something in there.

44:29.680 --> 44:31.680
So like they had a

44:31.680 --> 44:33.680
slide with blood on it and they were like

44:33.680 --> 44:35.680
I bet there's

44:35.680 --> 44:37.680
this is just full of little guys.

44:37.680 --> 44:39.680
I bet this is full of shit. Look at it.

44:39.680 --> 44:41.680
There's like little guys in there.

44:41.680 --> 44:43.680
I'm gonna call them amoebas for no reason.

44:43.680 --> 44:45.680
I bet that

44:45.680 --> 44:47.680
following the invention of both the telescope

44:47.680 --> 44:49.680
and microscope there was a lengthy

44:49.680 --> 44:51.680
period of time of trying to convince

44:51.680 --> 44:53.680
somebody that it wasn't a prank

44:53.680 --> 44:55.680
if you put your eye up against it.

44:55.680 --> 44:57.680
Like it probably was like

44:57.680 --> 44:59.680
yeah look through this. I'm not gonna look.

44:59.680 --> 45:01.680
I'm gonna look through that and like

45:01.680 --> 45:03.680
something's gonna like poke me in the eye

45:03.680 --> 45:05.680
or there's gonna be something in there that's like

45:05.680 --> 45:07.680
spooky. No thank you.

45:07.680 --> 45:09.680
I'm like no really. Like look in it.

45:09.680 --> 45:11.680
Whoever invented

45:11.680 --> 45:13.680
the microscope the day after definitely invented

45:13.680 --> 45:15.680
a prank microscope that like you look through it

45:15.680 --> 45:17.680
and it's their butt. Has anyone

45:17.680 --> 45:19.680
ever asked you to look into something and

45:19.680 --> 45:21.680
you've thought this is probably fine?

45:21.680 --> 45:23.680
No there's always a fear moment. They've probably

45:23.680 --> 45:25.680
invented the prank microscope

45:25.680 --> 45:27.680
first. Yeah. And people were like

45:27.680 --> 45:29.680
um no? Like that's

45:29.680 --> 45:31.680
like it's obviously a

45:31.680 --> 45:33.680
prank of some sort. So they had to

45:33.680 --> 45:35.680
invent the microscope

45:35.680 --> 45:37.680
next. Then.

45:37.680 --> 45:39.680
Oh we forgot they built the setup.

45:39.680 --> 45:41.680
Yeah yeah. It's like they had the punchline

45:41.680 --> 45:43.680
first. They're like well we gotta have something we're

45:43.680 --> 45:45.680
pretending that it is. What if we could like

45:45.680 --> 45:47.680
look at cells

45:47.680 --> 45:49.680
clothes or something.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.680
And then they did.

45:51.680 --> 45:53.680
And you know

45:53.680 --> 45:55.680
telescope gets invented. Probably a week later

45:55.680 --> 45:57.680
microscope gets invented. And then a week later

45:57.680 --> 45:59.680
after that some dude named Jeremy

45:59.680 --> 46:01.680
or something was like I got a new

46:01.680 --> 46:03.680
one and it's called a middle scope.

46:03.680 --> 46:05.680
What's it do Jeremy?

46:05.680 --> 46:07.680
It lets you look at middle sized stuff.

46:07.680 --> 46:09.680
It's got the one for big

46:09.680 --> 46:11.680
stuff in the heavens. And

46:11.680 --> 46:13.680
like moon. And then we got the one

46:13.680 --> 46:15.680
for blood and

46:15.680 --> 46:17.680
amoebas and stuff.

46:17.680 --> 46:19.680
But what about like a nice shirt?

46:19.680 --> 46:21.680
Don't have one for that.

46:21.680 --> 46:23.680
I'm Jeremy. This is my middle scope.

46:23.680 --> 46:25.680
And it's basically just

46:25.680 --> 46:27.680
a toilet paper tube.

46:27.680 --> 46:29.680
And it doesn't make things bigger or smaller.

46:29.680 --> 46:31.680
It helps you focus on

46:31.680 --> 46:33.680
a little bit. It really lets you dial in

46:33.680 --> 46:35.680
Travis.

46:35.680 --> 46:37.680
I also think probably the person who invented

46:37.680 --> 46:39.680
the telescope when they saw

46:39.680 --> 46:41.680
somebody be like I invented binoculars.

46:41.680 --> 46:43.680
And it's like you just taped two of mine.

46:43.680 --> 46:45.680
That's two of mine. You taped two of mine

46:45.680 --> 46:47.680
together. You asshole.

46:47.680 --> 46:49.680
Well here's a

46:49.680 --> 46:51.680
three eyed

46:51.680 --> 46:53.680
binoculars.

46:53.680 --> 46:55.680
They're trinoculars.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.680
One million dollars please patent office.

46:57.680 --> 46:59.680
Oh you don't want this one.

46:59.680 --> 47:01.680
Okay. What about a quadroscope

47:01.680 --> 47:03.680
so you and a friend can get cheek to cheek and

47:03.680 --> 47:05.680
really check out some birds.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.680
Really get up in those birds.

47:07.680 --> 47:09.680
Find out. Do you think the person who invented

47:09.680 --> 47:11.680
the magnifying glass was mad at the person

47:11.680 --> 47:13.680
who invented the microscope? I was like I did

47:13.680 --> 47:15.680
this already. I did this already.

47:15.680 --> 47:17.680
We finished this. Fat chance.

47:17.680 --> 47:19.680
Amoebas? I don't think

47:19.680 --> 47:21.680
so. Oh there are?

47:21.680 --> 47:23.680
Well fuck. Well shit.

47:23.680 --> 47:25.680
I don't know why I did that.

47:25.680 --> 47:27.680
I should have put two of these together.

47:27.680 --> 47:29.680
At my office there's a room

47:29.680 --> 47:31.680
called the wellness room. It's a small

47:31.680 --> 47:33.680
room near one of the break rooms

47:33.680 --> 47:35.680
that has a comfy chair and a lamp.

47:35.680 --> 47:37.680
I didn't think much of this room initially until I overheard my boss

47:37.680 --> 47:39.680
and coworker talk about how they knew someone

47:39.680 --> 47:41.680
who would reserve the

47:41.680 --> 47:43.680
wellness room for up to an hour and use it

47:43.680 --> 47:45.680
to take naps during the work day.

47:45.680 --> 47:47.680
Aw hell yeah.

47:47.680 --> 47:49.680
Now I'm incredibly interested in using this room

47:49.680 --> 47:51.680
to get in small naps during work

47:51.680 --> 47:53.680
days. I'm particularly tired but I don't know how to

47:53.680 --> 47:55.680
go about getting more information on how to reserve the room.

47:55.680 --> 47:57.680
I don't want to ask my boss or

47:57.680 --> 47:59.680
my coworkers as I don't want to give the people

47:59.680 --> 48:01.680
in my unit the impression I'm eager to

48:01.680 --> 48:03.680
nap during the work day even though you

48:03.680 --> 48:05.680
totally are. Yeah. Help me brothers.

48:05.680 --> 48:07.680
How do I get into this sweet nap room?

48:07.680 --> 48:09.680
That's from Overtired in Oklahoma.

48:09.680 --> 48:11.680
I mean I don't know what the chart looks like.

48:11.680 --> 48:13.680
You just gotta use the chart.

48:13.680 --> 48:15.680
That's why the wellness room is there.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.680
The

48:17.680 --> 48:19.680
sort of like

48:19.680 --> 48:21.680
corporate

48:21.680 --> 48:23.680
like way of thinking about

48:23.680 --> 48:25.680
wellness is changing in a

48:25.680 --> 48:27.680
really positive way

48:27.680 --> 48:29.680
where folks know that you gotta take care

48:29.680 --> 48:31.680
of yourself and they're trying to bake that

48:31.680 --> 48:33.680
I mean at like a cool

48:33.680 --> 48:35.680
a cool modern workplace.

48:35.680 --> 48:37.680
With like segways and

48:37.680 --> 48:39.680
cubicles that look like cabanas

48:39.680 --> 48:41.680
and stuff.

48:41.680 --> 48:43.680
And so you gotta. When we worked at AOL

48:43.680 --> 48:45.680
when we used to work at AOL a long

48:45.680 --> 48:47.680
long time ago they had a room

48:47.680 --> 48:49.680
full of

48:49.680 --> 48:51.680
nap pods and

48:51.680 --> 48:53.680
the room was called NapQuest

48:53.680 --> 48:55.680
and I got a big kick

48:55.680 --> 48:57.680
out of that but how's it going here Will?

48:57.680 --> 48:59.680
Very bad

48:59.680 --> 49:01.680
it does seem.

49:01.680 --> 49:03.680
I think I would be afraid if I heard

49:03.680 --> 49:05.680
somebody talk about the wellness room

49:05.680 --> 49:07.680
and they were like planting rumors that you

49:07.680 --> 49:09.680
could use it for naps cause the wellness room

49:09.680 --> 49:11.680
sounds like some Orwellian shit

49:11.680 --> 49:13.680
where I'm gonna go in there and then my eyes are gonna be

49:13.680 --> 49:15.680
held open while I watch training videos

49:15.680 --> 49:17.680
about like committing my time harder

49:17.680 --> 49:19.680
to working better and so like

49:19.680 --> 49:21.680
maybe the nap thing is just a lie that your

49:21.680 --> 49:23.680
boss said near your cubicle cause they know you're a real nap freak.

49:23.680 --> 49:25.680
No the wellness room

49:25.680 --> 49:27.680
is real and it's good and you gotta

49:27.680 --> 49:29.680
just do it and you gotta own

49:29.680 --> 49:31.680
it and you gotta assert yourself

49:31.680 --> 49:33.680
and you gotta take those good naps.

49:33.680 --> 49:35.680
Somebody else is already using it for that.

49:35.680 --> 49:37.680
It's not like you're breaking the wellness room.

49:37.680 --> 49:39.680
No I know but they're using it for one hour a day

49:39.680 --> 49:41.680
there's lots of hours in the day. 24 of them.

49:41.680 --> 49:43.680
No but that's what I'm saying. It's not like you're cheating

49:43.680 --> 49:45.680
with the wellness room if you wanna take naps in there.

49:45.680 --> 49:47.680
Like someone's already doing it you should feel free

49:47.680 --> 49:49.680
to take naps there. Like if you say I wanna take a nap

49:49.680 --> 49:51.680
in there your boss will be like yeah, yeah

49:51.680 --> 49:53.680
that's literally why we put it there.

49:53.680 --> 49:55.680
And here's the thing

49:55.680 --> 49:57.680
about the nap room.

49:57.680 --> 49:59.680
No one's gonna fucking wake you up

49:59.680 --> 50:01.680
if your nap goes a little bit longer. Your boss isn't gonna

50:01.680 --> 50:03.680
come in and you know

50:03.680 --> 50:05.680
push your shoulder while

50:05.680 --> 50:07.680
you're unconscious and be like hey

50:07.680 --> 50:09.680
hey sweet baby it's time to wake up

50:09.680 --> 50:11.680
rejoin the workforce. Hey

50:11.680 --> 50:13.680
it's time to get going on your day.

50:13.680 --> 50:15.680
So if you sleep through the alarm and you make it

50:15.680 --> 50:17.680
a good three hour nap

50:17.680 --> 50:19.680
I don't think anybody's gonna say shit

50:19.680 --> 50:21.680
cause it's the wellness room.

50:21.680 --> 50:23.680
This actually reminds me of a thing

50:23.680 --> 50:25.680
that I was working

50:25.680 --> 50:27.680
nah fuck it I'll say it. I was working at Sears

50:27.680 --> 50:29.680
and it was near

50:29.680 --> 50:31.680
near the end. I didn't know you worked at Sears.

50:31.680 --> 50:33.680
I worked at Land's End. I worked in the Land's End department

50:33.680 --> 50:35.680
near the end of my time

50:35.680 --> 50:37.680
there and Griffin and I lived very close

50:37.680 --> 50:39.680
to the Sears

50:39.680 --> 50:41.680
like five minute drive and one day

50:41.680 --> 50:43.680
I looked at my coworker in the Land's End

50:43.680 --> 50:45.680
it was a particularly slow day and I said

50:45.680 --> 50:47.680
we only get a half hour for lunch

50:47.680 --> 50:49.680
but I'm going to leave

50:49.680 --> 50:51.680
and you're gonna cover for me

50:51.680 --> 50:53.680
and I'm gonna be gone for like an hour

50:53.680 --> 50:55.680
and then I'm gonna come back and then you

50:55.680 --> 50:57.680
can do the same

50:57.680 --> 50:59.680
and we just won't tell anybody.

50:59.680 --> 51:01.680
Oh that's good. And we did that

51:01.680 --> 51:03.680
and the thing is is like

51:03.680 --> 51:05.680
the number of times I looked my boss

51:05.680 --> 51:07.680
square in the eye and said

51:07.680 --> 51:09.680
yeah I just forgot to clock back in but I was

51:09.680 --> 51:11.680
definitely here after half an hour

51:11.680 --> 51:13.680
they kept being mad at me

51:13.680 --> 51:15.680
but also nothing

51:15.680 --> 51:17.680
came of it and that's

51:17.680 --> 51:19.680
where I kind of learned that like rules

51:19.680 --> 51:21.680
are nothing. There is

51:21.680 --> 51:23.680
there is no enforcement. So just like

51:23.680 --> 51:25.680
go take your nap

51:25.680 --> 51:27.680
stay asleep whatever

51:27.680 --> 51:29.680
don't even set an alarm and then come back

51:29.680 --> 51:31.680
and be like I guess I must have slept

51:31.680 --> 51:33.680
you won't get in. Nobody cares

51:33.680 --> 51:35.680
nobody cares. They'll care

51:35.680 --> 51:37.680
as much as they think they need to for

51:37.680 --> 51:39.680
a second and then it will be over

51:39.680 --> 51:41.680
because nobody really cares all that much.

51:41.680 --> 51:43.680
Every office I've

51:43.680 --> 51:45.680
ever worked in has

51:45.680 --> 51:47.680
your right

51:47.680 --> 51:49.680
except one person

51:49.680 --> 51:51.680
who does care a lot

51:51.680 --> 51:53.680
and they could be the wild thing about this

51:53.680 --> 51:55.680
person is they could be in any position.

51:55.680 --> 51:57.680
You don't know. At the newspaper I worked

51:57.680 --> 51:59.680
at one time she was the photographer

51:59.680 --> 52:01.680
and she was the one who cared very

52:01.680 --> 52:03.680
much about everything that was

52:03.680 --> 52:05.680
happening at all times everywhere.

52:05.680 --> 52:07.680
There's one person like that at every job

52:07.680 --> 52:09.680
I think. Yeah I'll tell you one

52:09.680 --> 52:11.680
who doesn't love it

52:11.680 --> 52:13.680
is Mr. Tommy Sperl

52:13.680 --> 52:15.680
he really

52:15.680 --> 52:17.680
really wants you to

52:17.680 --> 52:19.680
he really really wants you

52:19.680 --> 52:21.680
to make sure those time cards are

52:21.680 --> 52:23.680
legit

52:23.680 --> 52:25.680
like good

52:25.680 --> 52:27.680
good time cards. Also at the

52:27.680 --> 52:29.680
movie theater in downtown Huntington

52:29.680 --> 52:31.680
I won't name names

52:31.680 --> 52:33.680
but they really want to make sure that

52:33.680 --> 52:35.680
those punch cards are

52:35.680 --> 52:37.680
really exact and a couple minutes

52:37.680 --> 52:39.680
late don't do that ever again.

52:39.680 --> 52:41.680
I'll put you

52:41.680 --> 52:43.680
in the stocks. So it's not

52:43.680 --> 52:45.680
universal like you said Travis. Tommy Smerl

52:45.680 --> 52:47.680
and the movie theater person

52:47.680 --> 52:49.680
really just

52:49.680 --> 52:51.680
want to ensure that no

52:51.680 --> 52:53.680
time crime.

52:53.680 --> 52:55.680
Tommy Smerl great dude but also

52:55.680 --> 52:57.680
time cop. But hard on time

52:57.680 --> 52:59.680
crime. Hard on time crime and so

52:59.680 --> 53:01.680
just make sure if you do work

53:01.680 --> 53:03.680
at Tridata Incorporated you

53:03.680 --> 53:05.680
are being

53:05.680 --> 53:07.680
not listening to Travis.

53:07.680 --> 53:09.680
Naps are important though. They're good.

53:09.680 --> 53:11.680
You have to take them.

53:11.680 --> 53:13.680
Carve yourself out a half hour. Get

53:13.680 --> 53:15.680
your pizziz going.

53:15.680 --> 53:17.680
And just take that nap. You do need it.

53:17.680 --> 53:19.680
Go to HR probably.

53:19.680 --> 53:21.680
They're in control of the wellness room. I would think

53:21.680 --> 53:23.680
you're gonna just find the chart

53:23.680 --> 53:25.680
where every day at

53:25.680 --> 53:27.680
like 12 is written

53:27.680 --> 53:29.680
on it like Dave sesh

53:29.680 --> 53:31.680
for like an hour where Dave is gonna get in there and have

53:31.680 --> 53:33.680
his sesh. And you can just pencil

53:33.680 --> 53:35.680
in after it Doug sesh

53:35.680 --> 53:37.680
or whatever. Whatever your name is.

53:37.680 --> 53:39.680
That's what you need. You need

53:39.680 --> 53:41.680
I think what has made

53:41.680 --> 53:43.680
my sneaking off from work and napping

53:43.680 --> 53:45.680
possible through all of my different

53:45.680 --> 53:47.680
retail jobs was I had a

53:47.680 --> 53:49.680
partner in crime. I had somebody

53:49.680 --> 53:51.680
that was like you look out for

53:51.680 --> 53:53.680
me and I'll look out for you. I'll go take

53:53.680 --> 53:55.680
a nap behind the refrigerator boxes

53:55.680 --> 53:57.680
at Best Buy and you

53:57.680 --> 53:59.680
do my work and then you can take a nap behind

53:59.680 --> 54:01.680
the refrigerator boxes and I'll do your

54:01.680 --> 54:03.680
work. And like

54:03.680 --> 54:05.680
you have to coordinate it out a

54:05.680 --> 54:07.680
little bit. So I think

54:07.680 --> 54:09.680
that maybe that's what I mean when I say nobody

54:09.680 --> 54:11.680
cares. You just need enough plausible

54:11.680 --> 54:13.680
deniability.

54:13.680 --> 54:15.680
It's also important to note that

54:15.680 --> 54:17.680
after they do that once they're dirty.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.680
And once they're dirty

54:19.680 --> 54:21.680
they cannot bring you

54:21.680 --> 54:23.680
you've got the juice on them

54:23.680 --> 54:25.680
and even though they've got the juice on you they can't

54:25.680 --> 54:27.680
bring you down. It brings you closer

54:27.680 --> 54:29.680
to his friends and criminals.

54:29.680 --> 54:31.680
Time criminals.

54:31.680 --> 54:33.680
Y'all ever watch the

54:33.680 --> 54:35.680
Office?

54:35.680 --> 54:37.680
Yeah.

54:37.680 --> 54:39.680
It's on Comedy Central now

54:39.680 --> 54:41.680
24 hours a day. That's funny.

54:41.680 --> 54:43.680
I don't think it's funny but I think

54:43.680 --> 54:45.680
Jim is very mean to Dwight.

54:45.680 --> 54:47.680
Although I did have a really

54:47.680 --> 54:49.680
intense and detailed dream the other day

54:49.680 --> 54:51.680
that I was traveling with.

54:51.680 --> 54:53.680
Hey Trav let me stop you.

54:53.680 --> 54:55.680
I don't want to hear about your dream.

54:55.680 --> 54:57.680
But I was traveling with.

54:57.680 --> 54:59.680
If you would do it actually

54:59.680 --> 55:01.680
that's you doing time crime on me and Justin.

55:01.680 --> 55:03.680
But I was traveling with the

55:03.680 --> 55:05.680
entire Office crew Griffin.

55:05.680 --> 55:07.680
Well I've changed my mind.

55:07.680 --> 55:09.680
Now I gotta know.

55:09.680 --> 55:11.680
We were trying to check into a hotel but.

55:11.680 --> 55:13.680
I'm taking a nap on the middle of this podcast.

55:13.680 --> 55:15.680
Michael hadn't reserved

55:15.680 --> 55:17.680
the hotel and it was all booked up.

55:17.680 --> 55:19.680
And it was me and Jim

55:19.680 --> 55:21.680
trying to fix everything.

55:21.680 --> 55:23.680
Yeah.

55:23.680 --> 55:25.680
For sure.

55:25.680 --> 55:27.680
And it just didn't pan out in the end.

55:27.680 --> 55:29.680
It didn't pan out.

55:29.680 --> 55:31.680
It's funny dude.

55:35.680 --> 55:37.680
I love that shit.

55:39.680 --> 55:41.680
Stanley's doing his thing.

55:41.680 --> 55:43.680
Stanley's off in the corner doing whatever.

55:43.680 --> 55:45.680
I love it man. More seasons.

55:45.680 --> 55:47.680
They're bringing it back.

55:47.680 --> 55:49.680
Loving that.

55:49.680 --> 55:51.680
More of it please.

55:51.680 --> 55:53.680
And they need a new Steve.

55:53.680 --> 55:55.680
Good.

55:55.680 --> 55:57.680
Closure. I love that Travis. Thank you.

55:57.680 --> 55:59.680
Thank you. I like to book in.

55:59.680 --> 56:01.680
So fun to book in.

56:01.680 --> 56:03.680
They do like Ricky

56:03.680 --> 56:05.680
come back and

56:05.680 --> 56:07.680
does a guest spot on it but then at some point

56:07.680 --> 56:09.680
he falls into a toilet.

56:09.680 --> 56:11.680
In real life. And flushed down.

56:11.680 --> 56:13.680
Book ending is better than

56:13.680 --> 56:15.680
having a good joke.

56:15.680 --> 56:17.680
Remember from the beginning?

56:17.680 --> 56:19.680
Uh huh.

56:19.680 --> 56:21.680
That's better and easier.

56:21.680 --> 56:23.680
Is this whole episode time crime that we did to our

56:23.680 --> 56:25.680
listeners?

56:25.680 --> 56:27.680
They can't get it back one way or the other.

56:27.680 --> 56:29.680
Thank you for listening.

56:29.680 --> 56:31.680
We got you.

56:31.680 --> 56:33.680
To our greatest heist yet.

56:33.680 --> 56:35.680
Our greatest most ambitious time heist.

56:35.680 --> 56:37.680
We

56:51.680 --> 56:53.680

56:53.680 --> 56:55.680
That's next week right Griff?

56:55.680 --> 56:57.680

58:39.680 --> 58:41.680
eight years ago become a career

58:41.680 --> 58:43.680

58:43.680 --> 58:45.680
our lives with that and we call on you

58:45.680 --> 58:47.680
to help us

58:47.680 --> 58:49.680
keep going. That is next week and we

58:49.680 --> 58:51.680
will have a very strange episode for

58:51.680 --> 58:53.680
you next week for episode 400 but we will also

58:53.680 --> 58:55.680
have more details on the drive

58:55.680 --> 58:57.680
then. Oh and thank you to Megan for the

58:57.680 --> 58:59.680
kind words in the promo that we ran

58:59.680 --> 59:01.680
earlier. Again

59:01.680 --> 59:03.680
Max Fun Drive starts next week

59:03.680 --> 59:05.680
runs April 2nd through the 13th.

59:05.680 --> 59:07.680
I have got

59:07.680 --> 59:09.680
let's do some plugs. I'm going to do them real

59:09.680 --> 59:11.680
fast. One, we have

59:11.680 --> 59:13.680
My Brother, My Brother, Me and Adventure Zone

59:13.680 --> 59:15.680
tour dates up

59:15.680 --> 59:17.680
on mcroryshows.com

59:17.680 --> 59:19.680
slash tours. That tour is about

59:19.680 --> 59:21.680
75% sold out. Like the whole

59:21.680 --> 59:23.680
thing on average is about 75% sold

59:23.680 --> 59:25.680
out. So don't wait to get your tickets.

59:25.680 --> 59:27.680
However, I will say the Houston

59:27.680 --> 59:29.680
show which is coming up very soon

59:29.680 --> 59:31.680
it's a little light.

59:31.680 --> 59:33.680
Houston! Houston!

59:33.680 --> 59:35.680
Here's the thing. I said boys come to

59:35.680 --> 59:37.680
Texas. So I won't have to travel very far

59:37.680 --> 59:39.680
and this is something

59:39.680 --> 59:41.680
that's very important to me is not having to travel

59:41.680 --> 59:43.680
very far. Houston needs your help to prove

59:43.680 --> 59:45.680
my thesis correct.

59:45.680 --> 59:47.680
So please go to mcroryshows.com

59:47.680 --> 59:49.680
slash tours. Also we didn't mention this last week

59:49.680 --> 59:51.680
we mentioned it on Adventure Zone but we are doing a book tour

59:51.680 --> 59:53.680
for the Adventure Zone graphic novel here.

59:53.680 --> 59:55.680
There will be Gerblin's which you can pre-order at theadventurezone

59:55.680 --> 59:57.680

59:57.680 --> 59:59.680

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.680
in July and you can also find tickets for

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.680
that and those go on sale

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.680

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.680

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.680

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.680
teamed up with DFTBA to

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.680
