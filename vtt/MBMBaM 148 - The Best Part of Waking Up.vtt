00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.240
Hello, everybody. Welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

00:48.240 --> 00:52.960
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. And boy, do we have an exciting,

00:52.960 --> 00:54.800
exciting way to kick off the show this week.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.760
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy, before Justin just skips all the way over to me.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.360
Yeah, I'm the baby brother, Griffin McElroy. And it's been a few episodes since I've

01:03.360 --> 01:06.560
said my name, because I feel like this shit really just runs off the rails

01:07.280 --> 01:10.880
pretty much as soon as we start. So thank you for the opportunity.

01:10.880 --> 01:17.760
Yeah. So this is a formal world exclusive. We have obtained through some unscrupulous methods,

01:18.800 --> 01:24.160
a leaked track off the Daphne Punk. Is that what you said, Griffin?

01:24.160 --> 01:26.800
Daphne Punk, yeah. Do you know the name of that album? Can you just...

01:26.800 --> 01:31.680
The title isn't even out there. I think it's called Daphne Punky Brewster.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.640
Okay. Now, Griffin, you've got a... Sorry,

01:34.640 --> 01:40.320
Daph Punk. I'm reading my cue cards here. Daph Punk. Can you tell us a bit about the track we're

01:40.320 --> 01:44.880
going to be hearing? Sure. So Daph Punk is a... They're one of those bands, sort of like extreme

01:44.880 --> 01:52.960
music that just does songs for commercials for, you know, like for The Gap. There was that one

01:52.960 --> 01:57.760
Gap commercial where the girl from Cape Fear just sort of danced in her jeans and was having a good

01:57.760 --> 02:03.120
time, and two friendly robots came along and just played her a song for her to enjoy the jeans in.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.680
Would I have heard them on Echoes with John D. Libertas?

02:07.440 --> 02:12.000
Were there Gap commercials that ran interstitially? Almost exclusively.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.360
Okay. Well then, yeah, probably, if it was like mid-2000s.

02:15.360 --> 02:20.000
All right. Let me just push... Let me get the cart here. I'm going to pop it in to the old...

02:20.000 --> 02:27.120
Okay, it's all loaded up. Is it eight tracks? Jesus. Yeah, and I'm just pushing play.

02:31.680 --> 02:39.040
Bring the beat. Gonna fuck the beat. Oh, yeah. Bring the beat. We're gonna fuck the beat.

02:39.040 --> 02:44.400
That's what a robot voice sounds like. Do you have some oil? Do you have some oil,

02:44.400 --> 02:51.760
oil? Do you have some oil for my robot legs? My fingers are USB drives,

02:51.760 --> 02:57.360
and we are gonna dance all night long today. What emotions.

02:57.920 --> 03:03.280
They make sure to, like, really specify when the dancing is going to take place.

03:04.400 --> 03:10.800
From 7 PM to 1 AM. We want a solid chunk of time.

03:10.800 --> 03:19.280
Do you want to dance before you'll be electrocuted? We are your dance lords.

03:19.280 --> 03:23.520
Just a reminder, we have to be out of the rec center by 10.

03:24.960 --> 03:33.120
Music ordinances kicking at 10.30. Please buy a CD. That's their new CD. Or a t-shirt or a Bible.

03:34.720 --> 03:39.840
It's pretty good. Pretty good goofs. Man, guys, I think Daft Punk has lost a step.

03:39.840 --> 03:43.120
I've never heard their music before, but I can't imagine it wasn't better.

03:43.680 --> 03:47.920
Or is it edgier than it's ever been? That's a good point. Their formula is really

03:47.920 --> 03:55.120
just say a bunch of verbs. Just say a bunch of verbs or adjectives. Just back to back to back,

03:55.120 --> 03:56.800
and it's like solid. How are they with gerunds?

03:57.520 --> 04:04.240
Gerunds? Texting, walking, running, looking. I would listen to that song.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.560
It's basically Schoolhouse Rock Live with a vocoder.

04:06.560 --> 04:13.440
So, let's actually help some people this week. Thank you first before we go any further. Thank

04:13.440 --> 04:22.240
you to everyone who helped us to crush our maximum fun drive goals. To those of you who are new

04:22.240 --> 04:29.600
donors, thank you so much. We're sure you're enjoying the show in a much more appropriate

04:29.600 --> 04:33.440
way than you ever have before. Or perhaps you are placing more scrutiny

04:33.440 --> 04:39.360
upon us than you've ever decided to expend. All sales are final.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.920
Well, they're not final. It's a monthly recurring thing.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.960
All sales are final. All right, cool.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.920
Let's answer some advice. Also, thank you guys so much, and thank you to Daft Punk.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.640
Thank you for coming on the show. Thank you.

04:54.640 --> 04:58.000
I recently visited a college that's five hours away with a friend from school.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.480
He'd been planning the trip for weeks and had intended to go alone. He invited me to accompany

05:02.480 --> 05:08.720
him at the last minute. On the way home, he was very clear that he expected gas money from me.

05:09.520 --> 05:15.120
He knows I don't have a job. Am I a freeloader for not feeling that I should pay for something

05:15.120 --> 05:20.560
that he has been prepared to pay for himself for weeks? That's from Possible Cheapskate in

05:20.560 --> 05:26.960
Chesapeake and Friend of Friends. First off, that is a great name for you're so lucky that your

05:26.960 --> 05:32.560
region dovetailed grammatically so well with Cheapskate. Secondly, that sucks.

05:32.560 --> 05:37.040
Yeah, he did a little rope-a-dope there.

05:37.040 --> 05:43.360
Well, let's answer some, because there's so many variables, right? There's so many variables.

05:43.360 --> 05:48.080
Where were you going? Were you going to Chicago? Were you going somewhere cool that you sort of

05:49.520 --> 05:53.120
did you enjoy the trip in any way? Because if it was just a favor for your friend,

05:53.120 --> 05:57.760
then fuck that guy. But if you went there for a destination hot dog,

05:58.320 --> 06:01.600
then you got something out of the experience. Yeah, maybe you should have to pony up.

06:01.600 --> 06:07.600
Well, here's the thing. I would say that if there was no discussion beforehand

06:07.600 --> 06:13.200
about splitting gas, if he was just like, hey, I'm headed up to Syracuse, you want to go?

06:15.280 --> 06:20.960
Yeah, I think that in most situations, there is an implied, I'll help out with gas,

06:20.960 --> 06:23.760
but if it was never discussed, you're not obligated.

06:24.880 --> 06:25.920
Oh, it's so tough.

06:25.920 --> 06:31.680
It is tough. And luckily, this is the kind of thing that when you get a little bit older and

06:32.880 --> 06:36.400
hopefully you and everyone you know becomes a little bit more financially secure, things like

06:36.400 --> 06:41.440
this and things like splitting the check just sort of stop being a problem or at least has

06:41.440 --> 06:46.320
big of a problem. But I mean, if he knows that you don't have any money, how do you not know

06:46.320 --> 06:51.120
what your friend's financial statuses are and then not put them in a situation

06:51.120 --> 06:52.480
that makes them uncomfortable?

06:52.480 --> 06:57.520
Yeah. Yeah, general rule. Hey, everybody out there, as it's getting to the time of year

06:57.520 --> 07:01.520
when everyone's going on spring break together and college visits and everything,

07:02.080 --> 07:05.600
stay to your friends beforehand. Like, hey, I'm going to need you to pony up some cash

07:05.600 --> 07:10.000
afterwards. And don't do it like you're going to break their knees because they got a free ride.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.200
But he was doing a favor. I mean, this should have been obvious. Like,

07:13.200 --> 07:19.120
you were obviously doing him a solid by going on this trip and not making him go alone to go

07:19.120 --> 07:26.000
college hunting, which will be a bummer. Also, side note, this guy's going to move five hours away.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.640
That $20 isn't going to move five hours away. That $20 is just going to be gone.

07:30.640 --> 07:31.200
Yeah.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.320
So I think that if he wants to sever your friendship, that's his problem.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.560
He also totally invited you. So it's a little sketchy to be like, hey, you want to go with me?

07:38.560 --> 07:42.800
Oh, by the way, now that you want to come, it's going to cost you.

07:42.800 --> 07:49.120
By the way, if you're going to split gas money, you got to do it tank by tank. And you fill up

07:49.120 --> 07:52.640
one tank, he fills up the other tank. If you're going to split it, that's how you do it.

07:52.640 --> 07:56.640
You don't fill up all the tanks and say, let me crunch some numbers real quick.

07:56.640 --> 07:57.920
Do some mileage calculations.

07:57.920 --> 08:03.360
Let me see it. With the mileage and the juice, you now owe me 65.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.200
Large.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.920
65 large. It's 65 large.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.280
It's $65,000.

08:10.560 --> 08:15.840
I drove there on plutonium, purest plutonium. What a dick.

08:15.840 --> 08:20.560
My car is fueled by Justin Bieber's fingers. So that is very pricey.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.200
Why is it his fingers? Did you see that fool?

08:23.200 --> 08:24.400
Did you see that?

08:24.400 --> 08:25.840
Did he do the funniest thing?

08:25.840 --> 08:29.600
The fucking, Travis, did you see this?

08:29.600 --> 08:32.640
No, what was it? I don't even find the exact quote. Hold on.

08:32.640 --> 08:37.920
So Justin Bieber visited the Anne Frank house like you do.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.840
Is this where your friend took you for a five-hour drive?

08:41.840 --> 08:42.480
Because that's insane.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.320
We're going to go to Anne Frank University.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.960
That's a destination hot dog. You're going to love it there.

08:48.480 --> 08:54.480
He went there and he had such a great time. It's very meaningful. It's a stirring experience.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.880
One is struck at the Anne Frank Museum.

08:56.880 --> 09:04.320
Um, and being so struck, Justin Bieber picked up pen, put it to the guestbook and wrote.

09:04.320 --> 09:08.560
Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.240
Hopefully she would have been a Belieber.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.680
That almost sounds menacing, doesn't it?

09:19.680 --> 09:21.840
Like if she knows what's good for her.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.320
If she wasn't a Belieber, fuck that broad.

09:24.320 --> 09:28.960
If she walked the true and honest path, then my love would have protected her.

09:28.960 --> 09:32.400
Do you know what I think she would not have actually been a fan of?

09:32.400 --> 09:39.120
Anything that emitted any kind of sound whatsoever that may betray her position.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.320
She was a discreet young woman.

09:42.320 --> 09:46.960
And I think that you screaming the word baby, like some sort of shrieking

09:47.680 --> 09:52.640
mandragora would fucking put her sort of off a little bit.

09:52.640 --> 09:57.520
The man wears giant sunglasses and gold gloves. Like she's trying to keep a low pro.

09:57.520 --> 10:01.040
She's trying to skirt it under the under the raid.

10:01.040 --> 10:04.240
And you are about as above the raid as there possibly is.

10:04.240 --> 10:08.560
Plus she couldn't she wouldn't be able to help herself from screaming and just

10:09.360 --> 10:11.680
grabbing at you, grabbing at your gins.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.720
We're getting off topic.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.680
We're getting off topic for the first time ever.

10:15.680 --> 10:19.600
No, but this is a bet. This is a legitimately shitty move.

10:19.600 --> 10:24.560
You weren't going you were going to try to help him out.

10:25.200 --> 10:30.880
You were certainly like not this was not like a shared buddy trip.

10:30.880 --> 10:36.800
I mean, I think I think that unless you're thinking about the college too, in which case,

10:36.800 --> 10:38.560
like, I mean, I guess.

10:38.560 --> 10:43.280
But even then, it seems kind of weanery because it wasn't discussed beforehand.

10:43.280 --> 10:47.360
Like he blew it, you know, if he wanted that to be part of the arrangement,

10:47.360 --> 10:49.040
he should have brought it up before.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.480
I think that you are well within your rights to not necessarily be like,

10:52.480 --> 10:53.440
uh, no, fuck you.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.480
I'm not giving you half the money.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.440
But to say, listen, man, I don't have that money,

10:57.440 --> 11:01.280
but now I owe you a favor for the ride and I'll hit you back later.

11:01.280 --> 11:01.840
You know what I mean?

11:01.840 --> 11:05.360
And then it'll probably just drop and never be a thing again anyways.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.320
You got to kill your friend.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.920
You got to kill your friend.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.200
You got to kill your friend.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.360
Man, we haven't dropped one of those in a while, have we?

11:11.360 --> 11:12.960
Listen, I've been watching a lot of Justify.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.200
And when you don't got that money, you got to kill him.

11:15.200 --> 11:19.280
You got to either kill him or like you got to trick somebody into getting the money

11:19.280 --> 11:22.960
for you from some bank that apparently has been robbed 18 times.

11:22.960 --> 11:27.120
The whole reason we have that Bob Ball disclaimer at the top of the show.

11:27.120 --> 11:27.840
Thank you, Bob Ball.

11:29.360 --> 11:33.280
So we can advise people to kill people as a joke and then we can't get sued for it.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.720
And we are squandering that.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.640
Hey, can I tangent off for a second, you guys?

11:36.640 --> 11:36.880
Sure.

11:37.440 --> 11:37.920
Sure.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.440
I saw a commercial last night.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.720
You know, those pass it on commercials where it's like integrity, pass it on,

11:42.720 --> 11:44.400
you know, sportsmanship, pass it on.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.040
I saw one.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.560
Those are for Scientology, right?

11:46.560 --> 11:47.040
Yeah.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.880
I saw one last night where like a teacher is in a classroom and it's all these middle

11:50.880 --> 11:55.680
school students and she's given a test and the kid starts passing a note.

11:55.680 --> 12:00.960
So she rolls over, like pins down the note with her ruler and all the kids like, oh,

12:00.960 --> 12:04.000
and she opens the note and it says, let's not cheat.

12:06.480 --> 12:09.920
And she like looks at the kids and nods and the title comes up.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.120
Honesty, pass it on.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.800
Wait a minute.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.920
The conspiracy is off.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.440
Abort, abort.

12:18.080 --> 12:22.080
But like, is the phrasing of that note not something that the teacher would go, wait,

12:22.080 --> 12:23.360
hold up, wait.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.240
So like until this moment, it was down.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.640
Like, oh, you know what?

12:28.640 --> 12:31.120
On second thought, guys, let's not cheat.

12:31.680 --> 12:35.520
What a wonderful way of casting dispersions on your seatmate.

12:35.520 --> 12:39.760
You want to pass him a note as I, on second, actually despite what you said.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.160
I don't know what he's talking about.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.280
No, I will not gay kiss your wiener.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.720
Let me see that note.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.760
No, I will not gay kiss your wiener.

12:51.760 --> 12:52.960
Honesty, pass it on.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.960
Todd, Todd.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.440
This is an all girls school.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.640
You're an absurdist comedian.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.520
I think you're fantastic.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.480
I think you're great.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.360
I love your work.

13:03.360 --> 13:04.560
Like a young Andy Kaufman.

13:04.560 --> 13:05.280
You want a yahoo?

13:06.080 --> 13:06.640
Yeah, please.

13:06.640 --> 13:08.800
Uh, this yahoo.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.120
Oh God, it's the Ira Ray show this week.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.040
Um, hold on, I'll give it, I'll give it to you.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.480
I'll give you the fucking prompt.

13:17.200 --> 13:17.440
Okay.

13:18.080 --> 13:18.960
This yahoo was sent by-

13:18.960 --> 13:20.000
I want to make sure I'm ready.

13:20.000 --> 13:20.960
This, oh fuck.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.640
Are you going to warn me beforehand?

13:22.640 --> 13:27.280
I'll say is I'll say the only prompt that you have, that we know that you've come to know

13:28.080 --> 13:29.520
the relationship that we built.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.720
I wasn't going to betray that.

13:31.280 --> 13:31.920
This yahoo was-

13:31.920 --> 13:32.400
Thank you.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.760
This yahoo was sent by Ira Ray.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.480
Wait, I wasn't ready.

13:36.480 --> 13:37.120
I'm done.

13:37.120 --> 13:37.920
Uh, thank you Ira Ray.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.360
Just one, just give it, give it to me one more time.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.480
This one was sent by Ira Ray.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.640
Ira Ray, who wants to know?

13:45.520 --> 13:46.240
How did you do that with your mouth?

13:46.240 --> 13:47.280
You're going to have to pass it.

13:47.280 --> 13:51.440
Can you pass into tabulature to, to that song?

13:51.440 --> 13:54.320
Cause it sounded like you played a J shark.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.480
It sounded like you played an R, R minor seventh.

13:59.040 --> 14:02.480
It also sounded a little bit like you were just giving him like in Western movies.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.960
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

14:04.960 --> 14:05.460
Thank you.

14:05.460 --> 14:06.820
Nope, that's not it.

14:06.820 --> 14:07.380
Here it is.

14:07.380 --> 14:07.940
It's not gonna-

14:13.780 --> 14:14.900
Are you Ira Ray?

14:14.900 --> 14:16.260
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

14:16.260 --> 14:16.980
Thank you Ira Ray.

14:16.980 --> 14:19.060
It's by yahoo interviewer Fairix who asks.

14:22.180 --> 14:24.340
Please don't interrupt it because it's so good.

14:24.340 --> 14:24.840
Okay.

14:25.860 --> 14:28.500
How does one become the official Ronald McDonald?

14:28.500 --> 14:32.900
I see that McDonald's uses basically one actor for all their media.

14:32.900 --> 14:38.260
And just out of curiosity, was wondering how one goes about applying to be the Ronald McDonald.

14:38.260 --> 14:42.260
Have checked out their website and it is never a job position open.

14:42.260 --> 14:46.180
Not that I want to be him, but just was curious how someone would go about becoming.

14:46.180 --> 14:47.220
First of all, horse shit.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.500
Of course you want to be him.

14:48.500 --> 14:53.860
Obviously everyone does who, who in their right mind would fucking look up to see if

14:53.860 --> 14:54.660
that position was open.

14:54.660 --> 14:55.860
If they weren't trying to be him.

14:55.860 --> 14:59.300
Look up to see if that position was open if they weren't trying to fill it.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.060
And you know you want to do it for the ladies.

15:04.340 --> 15:11.540
Gentlemen, I have before me a list of all the actors who've ever played Ronald McDonald.

15:11.540 --> 15:13.220
They only use one at a time.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.100
Is this, is this for real?

15:16.100 --> 15:22.260
Yes, I'm gonna ask you skill, skill testing questions about the actors who've played

15:22.260 --> 15:22.740
Ronald McDonald.

15:22.740 --> 15:27.460
First off, since 1963, how many actors do you believe have played Ronald McDonald?

15:27.460 --> 15:27.700
Twelve.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.140
Since 1963?

15:29.140 --> 15:29.380
Yeah.

15:30.420 --> 15:30.740
Six.

15:32.180 --> 15:33.220
Incorrect, nine.

15:33.940 --> 15:34.260
Nine.

15:34.260 --> 15:34.900
Split the middle.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.660
We would have fucking had it, Travis.

15:36.660 --> 15:38.100
Let's work together on the rest.

15:38.100 --> 15:38.500
Okay.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.940
No, Travis, wait.

15:39.940 --> 15:40.740
Let's not cheat.

15:44.740 --> 15:45.620
I don't want to cheat anymore.

15:45.620 --> 15:49.300
I probably, I came up with the idea first, but let's abandon that.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.340
Let's abandon that.

15:50.340 --> 15:54.420
I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you four names.

15:54.980 --> 16:01.540
You're going to tell me whether or not they were actual actor, the name, the actual names

16:01.540 --> 16:03.620
of actors that played Ronald McDonald.

16:03.620 --> 16:03.860
Okay.

16:05.540 --> 16:06.420
Jack the Pecky.

16:07.060 --> 16:07.300
Okay.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.380
Joe McGard.

16:10.900 --> 16:11.220
Okay.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.500
King Moody, Squire Fridell.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.300
I'm going to say all are actual.

16:17.300 --> 16:18.740
All are real.

16:18.740 --> 16:23.860
King Moody played Ronald McDonald from 75 to 1984.

16:23.860 --> 16:27.380
With a name like that, you simply cannot have a bad day.

16:27.380 --> 16:30.900
I also imagine, I want that to not be his Christian name.

16:30.900 --> 16:34.740
I want that to be like, he was sitting there going, I just need something to set me apart

16:34.740 --> 16:35.780
from the other applicants.

16:35.780 --> 16:41.140
Or like his wife was like, man, why are you so down all the time, King Moody?

16:41.140 --> 16:42.900
And he's like, fucking stop digging.

16:43.700 --> 16:45.220
You have struck gold, my lady.

16:45.220 --> 16:48.260
I also want to point out how much Joe McGard sounds like, oh my God.

16:48.260 --> 16:49.060
Joe McGard.

16:49.620 --> 16:50.580
Joe McGard, you guys.

16:51.780 --> 16:59.380
I am horrified of this person who walks into a McDonald's with Ronald McDonald clown makeup

16:59.380 --> 17:00.260
and kit.

17:00.980 --> 17:05.860
He's wearing his Ronald McDonald glad rags and he walks into a McDonald's like, here

17:05.860 --> 17:06.580
I am.

17:06.580 --> 17:07.300
Look no further.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.740
Look no further, you found me.

17:08.740 --> 17:09.860
Is this the audition zone?

17:10.500 --> 17:11.860
Is that what they call those?

17:11.860 --> 17:13.140
I'm ready to ace this thing.

17:13.140 --> 17:14.740
I'm ready to ace this audition in the audition zone.

17:14.740 --> 17:16.100
Sir, please get out of the ball pit.

17:16.820 --> 17:17.300
Why not?

17:17.300 --> 17:19.780
This is what this is what McD does.

17:19.780 --> 17:21.620
This is what me, McDo.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.420
He played the role.

17:24.420 --> 17:26.500
King Moody played the role for like seven years.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.620
It's insanity.

17:27.620 --> 17:28.340
Yeah.

17:28.340 --> 17:32.100
You know, I would like to see it like you see a list of like all the heavyweight champions

17:32.100 --> 17:34.420
where it's like King Moody versus blank.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.100
Because I think it's like a yearly thing.

17:36.100 --> 17:39.060
Someone steps up and they're like, I'm ready to be the new Ronald.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.060
And then you got to fight it out.

17:42.020 --> 17:46.420
And then eventually someone displaces and that's how they become the new Ronald.

17:46.420 --> 17:48.820
Who was the Ronald McDonald during our childhood?

17:50.420 --> 17:55.220
Well, it was mainly Squire Fridell, I guess, who was who had the part.

17:55.220 --> 17:56.340
Is there an active?

17:56.340 --> 17:58.660
There's not an active agent right now, right?

17:58.660 --> 17:59.140
He's asleep.

17:59.140 --> 18:00.260
He's a sleeper.

18:00.260 --> 18:00.980
No.

18:00.980 --> 18:03.140
Brad Lennon is the active agent.

18:03.140 --> 18:03.700
What the fuck?

18:03.700 --> 18:06.740
I haven't seen a fucking Ronald McDonald in a commercial in a grip.

18:07.460 --> 18:08.100
I actually really like-

18:08.100 --> 18:13.220
Is he just a body that they did the cast of for the statue that sits out on the bench

18:13.220 --> 18:14.340
with his arm around you?

18:14.340 --> 18:17.220
And that is actually a coffin made just for him.

18:18.420 --> 18:19.860
That's where he lies in wait.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.220
Ready for the activation order.

18:23.220 --> 18:28.660
Actually, if you click on the bio of Brad Lennon right now,

18:28.660 --> 18:30.660
it takes you to the page for Ronald McDonald,

18:30.660 --> 18:34.900
which is a very sort of Dread Pirate Roberts vibe that I enjoy.

18:34.900 --> 18:39.220
By the way, guys, I conducted a survey among our listeners a couple of weeks ago

18:39.220 --> 18:42.500
and they said their favorite thing is when Justin does internet on tape.

18:42.500 --> 18:47.860
Who has the time to read the internet when Justin can just read the whole thing to you?

18:47.860 --> 18:50.740
You know, someday I'm gonna get through the whole thing.

18:50.740 --> 18:55.540
IMDB is so deep and it's like it would take me ages to read all of it.

18:55.540 --> 18:56.420
Don't worry about it.

18:56.980 --> 18:57.700
Don't worry about it.

18:57.700 --> 19:00.660
Justin's got you for your car, for your kitchen, for your home.

19:00.660 --> 19:04.260
I will read the internet to you anywhere.

19:04.260 --> 19:04.740
Anywhere.

19:04.740 --> 19:05.300
Anytime.

19:05.300 --> 19:13.060
I hope to high heavens that McDonald's never does the thing that

19:13.700 --> 19:15.620
I feel like a couple places have done it.

19:15.620 --> 19:19.860
Wendy's is the latest transgressor where they take their mascot

19:20.420 --> 19:25.780
and they turn it into a real human being with like real human being attributes

19:25.780 --> 19:28.980
and then have them talk about how fun their food is.

19:28.980 --> 19:29.540
Like Wendy's has-

19:29.540 --> 19:31.220
Are you talking about that red haired girl?

19:31.220 --> 19:34.100
It's a red haired girl and she's like a real girl now

19:34.100 --> 19:36.340
and she's just like, you know, an attractive looking-

19:36.340 --> 19:37.300
But you know what's funny?

19:37.300 --> 19:41.140
I've never once seen a single Wendy's commercial though where she is called Wendy.

19:41.140 --> 19:42.420
No, but come the fuck on.

19:42.420 --> 19:43.300
There's clear-

19:43.300 --> 19:46.260
Well, no, here's the troubling thing though about this commercial.

19:46.260 --> 19:51.380
There's also a Wendy's commercial airing opposite that one that features actual Wendy

19:51.380 --> 19:53.380
and she's an overweight middle-aged woman.

19:53.380 --> 19:58.420
So that's gotta be hard to see that they've like recast you as the person you are.

19:58.420 --> 20:04.100
They also have a Wendy's commercial in which the cartoon emblem of Wendy's speaks.

20:04.100 --> 20:06.100
Yeah, I don't like that either.

20:06.100 --> 20:10.420
So it's like a father, son, and holy ghost kind of thing that they've got going on

20:10.420 --> 20:11.300
that's really creeping me out.

20:11.300 --> 20:13.140
One of these Wendy's is gonna do it for you.

20:13.140 --> 20:15.700
You will be able to beat it to one of these Wendy's.

20:17.620 --> 20:21.540
I hope to Jesus, if you're a McDonald's executive

20:21.540 --> 20:23.300
and you're listening to this episode of the podcast,

20:23.300 --> 20:24.260
thank you for your patronage,

20:24.260 --> 20:29.860
but also if you ever make a commercial featuring a Ronald McDonald who is not a clown,

20:30.820 --> 20:36.100
can you imagine like a hip reinvention of Ronald?

20:36.100 --> 20:42.500
He's like a 22-year-old hipster that just like talks about how fun it is to eat chicken dippers.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.860
Well, I mean, he's carrot top.

20:44.740 --> 20:49.620
If we bring him into the real, if we bring him out of cool world and into our world.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.380
I referenced that movie the other day.

20:53.380 --> 20:56.740
I said the cartoon movie with Brad Pitt that wasn't Roger Rabbit

20:56.740 --> 20:59.300
and people thought I was fucking smoking crack.

21:01.540 --> 21:02.820
Let me get with it.

21:02.820 --> 21:04.100
Yep, get with the program.

21:04.100 --> 21:05.140
How do you pick?

21:05.140 --> 21:07.540
Okay, so the question, the pressing question.

21:09.060 --> 21:12.420
Actually, how much when they pick a Pope,

21:14.100 --> 21:15.220
they dig deep, right?

21:15.220 --> 21:17.780
Like they have to get into his history.

21:19.540 --> 21:22.260
You do that with the president when you're vetting your presidential candidate.

21:22.260 --> 21:27.060
Like how deep do you have to go into the closet

21:27.060 --> 21:34.180
of the man who will be playing the giant child befriending clown?

21:34.180 --> 21:40.260
My opinion, my take on it, I bet it is like president vetting plus Pope times three.

21:40.260 --> 21:40.500
Yeah.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.460
Oh, it's gotta be.

21:41.460 --> 21:44.020
Well, yeah, because how do you find a clown?

21:44.020 --> 21:46.500
Because I imagine they're looking for former clown experience.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.220
How do you find a clown that hasn't at least killed one kid?

21:49.220 --> 21:51.300
Mm-hmm.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.100
How do you do that?

21:52.980 --> 21:53.620
Good luck.

21:53.620 --> 21:54.980
How do you thread that needle?

21:54.980 --> 21:56.260
You can't thread that needle.

21:57.940 --> 22:02.260
You gotta like Captain America it and just take like a normal guy who hasn't been a clown

22:02.260 --> 22:04.500
and then get Stanley Tucci to inject stuff in him.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.380
How do you think clowns know what kids find so funny?

22:07.940 --> 22:09.300
It's because they've cut them open.

22:09.300 --> 22:10.900
They got inside there.

22:12.740 --> 22:13.780
This is getting dark.

22:13.780 --> 22:18.020
I don't know how Squire Fidel is so easily able to touch the heart of a child.

22:18.020 --> 22:20.820
Yeah, because he knows like exactly where it is.

22:20.820 --> 22:21.780
Exactly where the aorta starts.

22:21.780 --> 22:23.620
Do you think at this point he's Knight Fidel?

22:25.220 --> 22:26.340
I hope so.

22:26.340 --> 22:27.620
Let's answer your question.

22:27.620 --> 22:28.340
I'm fucking freaked out.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.900
Oh, one other note about Squire Fidel super quick.

22:30.900 --> 22:36.260
He was the Ronald McDonald in Mac and Me.

22:36.260 --> 22:38.420
So if you've seen Mac and Me.

22:39.220 --> 22:40.820
Please turn to side two.

22:43.540 --> 22:44.660
I knew that one though.

22:45.700 --> 22:46.420
I didn't know.

22:46.420 --> 22:48.340
You didn't know shit.

22:48.340 --> 22:50.900
Mac and Me only made back half of the budget.

22:50.900 --> 22:51.940
Stop it.

22:51.940 --> 22:54.340
Stop it, please.

22:54.340 --> 22:55.540
You want another question?

22:55.540 --> 22:55.940
Jesus.

22:55.940 --> 22:58.180
Not Mac and Me related and not from Wikipedia.

22:58.180 --> 22:58.980
Is that what you're telling me?

22:58.980 --> 22:59.480
Yes.

23:00.500 --> 23:04.100
At the college dorm in which I resided for the past semester,

23:04.820 --> 23:10.020
there is a shared set of washing machines and dryers for students usage in the building basement.

23:10.020 --> 23:14.980
While my laundry is washing, I'll generally spend time up in my room or chatting with friends.

23:14.980 --> 23:18.900
However, if I'm away from my clothes for any amount of time they are done in the wash,

23:18.900 --> 23:23.060
it's likely another resident will remove my clothes, place it on top of the washing machine,

23:23.060 --> 23:24.500
and set their own clothes to wash.

23:25.060 --> 23:28.820
This happens also when I use the dryer and my friends have all tested the same.

23:28.820 --> 23:33.540
Am I mistaken in thinking this is a violation of my right not to have my underwear viewed publicly

23:34.180 --> 23:38.340
and touched by foreign hands or am I just being oversensitive?

23:38.340 --> 23:40.820
What should I do to prevent this from happening again?

23:40.820 --> 23:42.900
Not a nudist in New England.

23:42.900 --> 23:44.420
There's a really easy solution.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.220
Yeah.

23:45.220 --> 23:46.500
To keep this from happening again.

23:46.500 --> 23:51.220
And that's fucking just take your shit out of the shit when it's done.

23:51.220 --> 23:52.740
Because people are busy too.

23:52.740 --> 23:54.020
Other people are busy.

23:54.020 --> 24:00.180
I would also ask, kind of the one factor is it depends on the size of the laundry room.

24:00.180 --> 24:03.300
Is this like you guys share one set of washer and dryer

24:03.300 --> 24:06.580
or there's like 20 sets of washer and dryer and someone's just being an asshole?

24:06.580 --> 24:07.140
I mean, it's obviously-

24:07.140 --> 24:12.500
Wait, is your question, someone will see an empty washing machine,

24:12.500 --> 24:15.140
see a full one of your clothes and say, well, fuck that guy.

24:15.140 --> 24:15.940
You know what?

24:15.940 --> 24:22.180
At my college in my dorm, there were sets of washers and dryers that people just wouldn't use

24:22.180 --> 24:24.180
because they all had different opinions of like,

24:24.180 --> 24:27.620
oh no, it takes way too long to dry in those and it won't get it all the way done

24:27.620 --> 24:29.540
and that washer smells weird.

24:29.540 --> 24:33.460
So yeah, there would be like people had favorite washers and dryers that they would do that.

24:33.460 --> 24:34.900
That's fucking bonkers.

24:34.900 --> 24:35.300
It was.

24:35.300 --> 24:39.380
And then I saw one time like somebody put tennis shoes in a fucking dryer.

24:39.380 --> 24:39.780
Oh.

24:39.780 --> 24:41.140
I'm like, just destroy it.

24:41.140 --> 24:41.860
How's that-

24:41.860 --> 24:43.060
Destroy the dryer.

24:43.060 --> 24:45.780
How's that potpourri spreading?

24:45.780 --> 24:46.820
Yeah, let's heat these up.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.100
Let's get the funk out of these.

24:48.660 --> 24:53.700
And they like duct taped the dryer shut because like, you know, it would knock the door open.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.220
It was the fucking stupidest thing.

24:57.780 --> 25:02.500
You are living under the assumption that everybody in your dorm is a pervert

25:02.500 --> 25:11.460
and that they will, like when they are taking your poopy boxers out of the washer,

25:11.460 --> 25:18.900
they're like looking at them and just like, oh God, yes, this is just how I wanted to spend my Tuesday

25:18.900 --> 25:22.580
is touching something that has touched a complete stranger's bung.

25:22.580 --> 25:24.100
This is just what I needed.

25:24.100 --> 25:28.980
Even that sexual, the sexual evidence has been erased by washing.

25:28.980 --> 25:29.940
Exactly.

25:29.940 --> 25:33.140
You can't even trick yourself and the thing is there's some still young-

25:33.140 --> 25:34.900
And they are soaking wet.

25:34.900 --> 25:35.220
Oh.

25:35.220 --> 25:38.260
There's young fresh bung butter on there somewhere.

25:38.260 --> 25:39.220
Oh God.

25:39.220 --> 25:39.460
God.

25:39.460 --> 25:40.500
You fool.

25:40.500 --> 25:41.460
This is exactly what I-

25:41.460 --> 25:43.140
You fool butthole.

25:43.140 --> 25:46.900
If there's anything I love touching more than strangers undergarments,

25:46.900 --> 25:49.220
it's when they're also moist.

25:50.020 --> 25:50.260
Fuck.

25:50.820 --> 25:53.140
No, it's gross and it's kind of rude.

25:53.140 --> 25:54.020
And you did it.

25:54.020 --> 25:54.740
It's your fault.

25:54.740 --> 25:55.220
And you did it.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.340
Just go downstairs and wait to open, like wait to do that.

25:58.340 --> 25:59.220
Find out how long-

25:59.220 --> 26:02.740
If your complaint is, man, I hate waiting for my laundry to be done.

26:02.740 --> 26:03.300
Yeah.

26:03.300 --> 26:03.700
Yeah.

26:03.700 --> 26:04.740
Yeah, everybody.

26:04.740 --> 26:05.620
Everybody does.

26:05.620 --> 26:06.980
You know what people also hate?

26:06.980 --> 26:11.540
Waiting to start doing their laundry, waiting to wait for their laundry to be done

26:11.540 --> 26:13.380
because somebody left their shit in the shit.

26:13.380 --> 26:14.420
Just take it out.

26:14.420 --> 26:15.780
Set a timer now.

26:15.780 --> 26:18.100
That said, I'm going to tell you how to do it.

26:18.100 --> 26:18.660
Okay.

26:18.660 --> 26:22.180
And I've never done this before but it occurred to me and I think it would work.

26:22.180 --> 26:24.980
And it requires that when you put your laundry in the machine,

26:24.980 --> 26:26.420
no one else is in there.

26:26.420 --> 26:26.660
Okay.

26:26.660 --> 26:31.700
Okay, you're going to pop a sign the same size as the window of the washer and dryer

26:31.700 --> 26:32.900
that says out of order.

26:34.020 --> 26:35.940
Oh, okay.

26:35.940 --> 26:38.260
Your shit is done and people come downstairs.

26:38.260 --> 26:40.340
They're like, oh, well, that one doesn't work.

26:40.340 --> 26:41.700
And they're going to leave your shit alone.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.780
Let's just hope they don't come in while it's-

26:43.780 --> 26:45.700
It's all fucking functioning.

26:45.700 --> 26:50.820
Even then, my point being that it will put a seed of doubt in their minds and they're like,

26:50.820 --> 26:54.740
well, someone put their clothes in, but what if it is like,

26:54.740 --> 26:56.900
you're not supposed to, you know, burn their clothes there to like,

26:56.900 --> 26:58.100
make their clothes smell like dookie.

26:58.100 --> 27:01.620
Well, then why don't you put more, make it more specific

27:01.620 --> 27:04.420
and put a sign on it that says like, this is super hot.

27:04.420 --> 27:05.940
It'll cook your clothes.

27:05.940 --> 27:09.300
Or if you just put a sign up on the dryer that just says, is a microwave.

27:11.060 --> 27:12.260
Do you like that?

27:12.260 --> 27:13.380
That would be pretty good.

27:13.380 --> 27:18.660
The first time that you go to leave your washing or drying unattended

27:18.660 --> 27:22.020
and you put jelly on the handle, then you went,

27:22.020 --> 27:27.700
you went, if you could, ideally you would be waiting in an adjacent washing machine.

27:27.700 --> 27:30.580
You could just pop out and there's jelly.

27:30.580 --> 27:36.100
Justin just fucking went through college with a bandolier of Vaseline around it,

27:36.100 --> 27:37.700
just dishing out justice.

27:37.700 --> 27:39.220
Like, you parked a little close to my car.

27:39.220 --> 27:39.700
Let me just-

27:43.060 --> 27:44.500
Vaseline might be more pleasant though.

27:44.500 --> 27:46.900
Like, if you have jelly on your hands, that's like your whole day.

27:46.900 --> 27:48.740
Oh, syrup, syrup.

27:48.740 --> 27:54.180
Oh, syrup fucking forms a bio fuse with your hand.

27:54.180 --> 27:55.940
It melds with your DNA.

27:55.940 --> 27:56.820
Or like, poop.

27:57.780 --> 27:59.140
Come on, Trav.

27:59.140 --> 27:59.460
What?

27:59.460 --> 27:59.860
I-

27:59.860 --> 28:00.580
Come on.

28:00.580 --> 28:01.700
A logical conclusion.

28:02.500 --> 28:03.060
Come on.

28:03.700 --> 28:04.580
You're right.

28:04.580 --> 28:07.460
How do you get poop from your butt to the handle of the washing machine?

28:07.460 --> 28:13.380
We were talking about like, things you can put on pancakes and then you-

28:13.380 --> 28:14.420
Just some jinx, man.

28:14.420 --> 28:15.300
Not like-

28:15.300 --> 28:20.180
We're talking about hijinks, not like fucking federal prison.

28:20.180 --> 28:21.780
Goddamn, for butts.

28:21.780 --> 28:22.820
God, Trav.

28:22.820 --> 28:23.060
Fuck.

28:23.060 --> 28:23.780
Listen, I feel awful.

28:23.780 --> 28:25.940
You really shot the cannon indoors on this one, Trav.

28:25.940 --> 28:26.740
I feel awful.

28:26.740 --> 28:27.060
Yeah.

28:27.060 --> 28:27.940
Do you guys want Yahoo?

28:28.580 --> 28:29.540
Yeah, I do actually.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.220
Oh, this is such a great segue.

28:33.220 --> 28:34.500
This one was sent in by Ira Ray.

28:35.140 --> 28:36.500
Are you Ira Ray?

28:37.140 --> 28:38.180
Who wants to know?

28:40.020 --> 28:42.500
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Bob, who asks,

28:42.500 --> 28:45.700
how to hurt someone stole your money.

28:45.700 --> 28:48.340
Someone stole $20 from me and I know they will try again.

28:48.340 --> 28:50.420
I was thinking of putting a mousetrap in my pocket,

28:50.420 --> 28:53.300
so the next time they try to take it, pop, ow.

28:54.180 --> 28:54.740
Yep.

28:54.740 --> 28:55.380
Should I do this?

28:55.380 --> 28:56.500
Couldn't backfire at all.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.660
Should I do this or something else to cause more harm?

28:58.660 --> 29:01.700
I want to have evidence, but I don't want to ruin my pants in the process.

29:01.700 --> 29:02.900
Maybe a needle?

29:02.900 --> 29:03.940
Indian ideas?

29:07.300 --> 29:07.620
What?

29:08.180 --> 29:08.900
Indian-

29:08.900 --> 29:09.620
Any ideas?

29:10.260 --> 29:10.500
Okay.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.980
Okay, wait.

29:14.820 --> 29:19.780
Okay, so they had a $20 bill in their pocket.

29:19.780 --> 29:24.660
They noticed the $20 bill had gone astray and they thought that what had happened was

29:24.660 --> 29:31.460
someone had reached into their pants pocket and taken a $20 bill out.

29:31.460 --> 29:38.100
This same person has a sort of fundamental misunderstanding of just mousetrap physics.

29:38.100 --> 29:41.540
Or just physics, just spatial physics in general.

29:43.380 --> 29:48.980
Unless you're wearing some fucking jinkos, unless you're sporting those jinkos,

29:48.980 --> 29:50.900
you could put a fucking landmine.

29:50.900 --> 29:53.460
You could put a claymore in those things and it would be fine.

29:55.140 --> 29:56.900
Some jinkos come with landmines.

29:58.020 --> 29:59.940
That's actually the best answer.

29:59.940 --> 30:02.180
It's by Yahoo Answers user Fred who says,

30:02.180 --> 30:06.100
go to Walmart, buy duct tape and several PVC pipes, oil, and glass.

30:06.100 --> 30:08.260
Also buy a radio and a receiver.

30:08.260 --> 30:12.980
Put the oil and shards of glass inside the PVC pipes and close up the ends with duct tape.

30:12.980 --> 30:17.700
Once you do this, put a radio receiver on each PVP pipe.

30:18.500 --> 30:22.500
Use your radio to set off the pipes once you put them in and around his house.

30:22.500 --> 30:23.460
The result of this-

30:23.460 --> 30:25.700
That didn't make any- what?

30:25.700 --> 30:28.020
The result of this is that he will die.

30:28.580 --> 30:30.500
That's how you get back at him, smiley face.

30:31.380 --> 30:31.780
Source?

30:32.820 --> 30:33.620
Ex-Marine.

30:34.420 --> 30:34.920
Yes!

30:34.920 --> 30:39.000
Oh, Ex-Marine, you've solved the problem so elegantly.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.200
Whiskey Tango Fox try.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.600
Come on, Ex-Marine, Ex-Marine.

30:42.600 --> 30:47.960
The one ingredient you left out of your explosive device is any kind of explosive.

30:47.960 --> 30:48.920
Well, they said oil.

30:48.920 --> 30:52.920
So like, you know how whenever you are on a walkie talkie and you send a message to

30:52.920 --> 30:54.760
one of your friends and it electrocutes them a little bit?

30:55.880 --> 30:56.600
Just a bit.

30:57.320 --> 30:57.800
And it's fine-

30:57.800 --> 31:00.440
God forbid they be anywhere near any kind of oil.

31:00.440 --> 31:01.880
I saw this happen on Mythbusters.

31:01.880 --> 31:02.520
It's fine.

31:02.520 --> 31:09.720
I think that if you are building a solution to a problem, if you're constructing a solution

31:09.720 --> 31:17.480
to a problem, chief among the requirement for it to be a valid solution is that it does

31:17.480 --> 31:19.480
not kill you in the process.

31:19.480 --> 31:25.000
And I think that you are really robbing Peter to pay Paul for this one because you will die.

31:26.280 --> 31:30.520
Well, it'd be great too, though, if you destroyed his house and he just barely survives and

31:30.520 --> 31:32.280
looked at you and was like, why did you do this?

31:32.280 --> 31:34.920
I'm like, because you took that $20 out of my pocket.

31:35.560 --> 31:41.160
You mean the $20 that is now glass covered, burning ash across the highway?

31:41.160 --> 31:42.600
That used to be your asshole?

31:43.720 --> 31:45.400
That was a full King Solomon.

31:45.400 --> 31:48.760
You just like destroyed it so neither of you could have it to prove that you love that

31:48.760 --> 31:49.720
$20 bill more.

31:51.720 --> 31:57.080
The butt surgery you require tragically is going to cost much, much more than that.

31:58.040 --> 32:02.200
And then after all is said and done, you remember that like you loaned him that $20 when you

32:02.200 --> 32:02.700
were drunk.

32:03.960 --> 32:09.320
I think you got to put a plastic bag in there and you put some sort of some sort of material

32:09.320 --> 32:12.440
on there that just cover your $20 in Vaseline.

32:12.440 --> 32:12.760
Yeah.

32:12.760 --> 32:17.960
Or maybe if there was God, if there was some sort of some sort of secure, some sort of

32:17.960 --> 32:23.640
way to secure your wallet, like to your body that would look cool and also kind of tough

32:23.640 --> 32:25.880
and sort of like let people know what kind of music you listen to.

32:25.880 --> 32:30.600
What if the material you put in your pocket that gets on his hand is some sort of bioluminescent

32:30.600 --> 32:34.120
marking fluid that signals the drone strike attack?

32:36.120 --> 32:40.040
This is that is predicated on you also having access to Drone Sex Marines.

32:40.040 --> 32:43.640
I also though I would counterpoint by saying that it's important that whatever solution

32:43.640 --> 32:45.480
you come up with costs less than $20.

32:49.480 --> 32:54.440
Why don't you just kill them with this drone strike that cost me $20,000 worth of $20,000?

32:54.440 --> 32:56.520
Worth it.

32:56.520 --> 33:00.200
Or just start carrying around $10 bills and then they get they go through all the work

33:00.200 --> 33:06.360
to pickpocket you and they say what it's a 10 and you turn around and say enjoy enjoy

33:06.360 --> 33:10.040
the $10 bill it's half of the haul you thought this isn't pretty good.

33:10.680 --> 33:14.360
Well then you just turn around and go in this economy and then you kick them in the face.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.800
Yeah you say that doesn't fix anything.

33:17.800 --> 33:24.760
I got a soda outside of the ATB because I was just parched and I put in $2 for the $1.25

33:24.760 --> 33:25.720
charge for the soda.

33:25.720 --> 33:27.880
It was a wild cherry Pepsi so I was pretty excited.

33:27.880 --> 33:35.160
It's rare that I treat myself to a wild cherry Pepsi and the fucking machine spat out seven

33:35.160 --> 33:40.360
dimes and a nickel and I just I swear to God I just turned and walked away from it.

33:40.360 --> 33:43.800
I said nope that's going to be some that's going to someone's going to enjoy that but

33:43.800 --> 33:48.760
it's that's not for me seven times a nickel that's not for me thanks three quarters and

33:48.760 --> 33:50.360
then we can fucking talk about it.

33:50.360 --> 33:55.320
What if you have big enough pockets right and you just converted it $20 into like into

33:55.320 --> 33:59.640
dimes or like nickels and like somebody went to pickpocket you and they're just like what

33:59.640 --> 34:01.480
the fuck I'm gonna be here all day.

34:01.480 --> 34:05.480
I'll tell you an element that would help to set this goof off if there was some coin

34:05.480 --> 34:06.440
smaller than nickels.

34:06.440 --> 34:13.960
Listen I didn't want to get ridiculous okay Justin two thousand pennies you wouldn't be

34:13.960 --> 34:14.840
able to walk.

Yes you would and your fucking ginko jeans it's like you haven't watched Dawson's Creek.

34:18.440 --> 34:19.960
You would have to triple belt it.

34:20.840 --> 34:21.800
Oh god.

34:21.800 --> 34:22.840
Let's go to the money zone.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.160
Seeing you stealing money.

34:25.160 --> 34:39.400
Happy belated birthday to Adam Rhodes from Marlena.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.280
His b-day was March 1st.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.440
You missed it by a bit.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.120
Missed it by a skosh.

34:46.120 --> 34:48.600
Here's the thing though this is not Marlena's fault.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.360
We done fucked up.

34:50.360 --> 34:50.920

He had it he was working on his new Daft Punk album and he messed this one up so.

35:01.640 --> 35:02.760
He lost track of time.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.440
We are very sorry about that.

35:04.440 --> 35:07.560
Running walking going to the store and buy.

35:15.240 --> 35:16.600
Is he gonna call and apologize?

35:16.600 --> 35:17.400
Of course not.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.760
No he leaves that to us.

35:18.760 --> 35:21.880
The third member of Daft Punk is just a drunk deadbeat dad.

35:23.160 --> 35:26.920
I forgot to pick you up from soccer practice oh no.

35:28.920 --> 35:35.720
Today tonight we will go getting ice cream from the Baskin Robbins at 7 30.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.800
After your sister gets home from ballet.

35:41.240 --> 35:45.320
This was a goldfish that I left in my van and now it's dead.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.440
But I thought you'd like it anyways.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.520
I thought you'd like it anyway.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.840
Either way you learn about real life.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.600
So happy birthday to Adam.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.200
He's officially in his mid-20s.

36:00.200 --> 36:06.600
He's an old man and Marlena says she hopes that this year brings you a wonderful balance of success

36:06.600 --> 36:07.960
and fun.

36:08.600 --> 36:14.200
So we are sorry that we messed this up by six weeks and we're very sorry.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.040
I'm turning 26 this week and I was debating.

36:16.040 --> 36:18.040
What?

36:18.040 --> 36:21.720
Yeah am I gonna be in my mid or late 20s?

36:21.720 --> 36:23.080
Mid.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.360
Mid.

36:24.360 --> 36:26.120
When does it cross over like 20?

36:26.120 --> 36:30.520
First three years is early 20s mid three years is mid 20s last three years is late 20s.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.280
Okay you got an extra year there.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.720
Travis is telling himself that because he's about to turn 30.

36:35.720 --> 36:36.520
That's correct.

36:36.520 --> 36:37.400
Dirty 30 though.

36:38.600 --> 36:39.320
Yeah.

36:39.320 --> 36:40.360
Flirty 30.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.040
I'm gonna buy myself a Jumbotron message.

36:42.040 --> 36:43.000
Squirty 30?

36:44.040 --> 36:44.840
No.

36:44.840 --> 36:45.080
No.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.400
So Travis we got any other messages?

36:48.200 --> 36:48.440
Yes.

36:49.320 --> 36:51.000
They're on the paper in front of you.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.440
I know that you know that there are.

36:52.440 --> 36:53.320
Do you want me to read them?

36:53.320 --> 36:54.120
Yeah just one of them.

36:54.680 --> 36:54.920
Okay.

36:56.120 --> 36:56.680
This next message-

36:56.680 --> 36:58.760
I'm watching you read two simultaneously.

36:58.760 --> 36:59.240
That would be a real time saver.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.200
I can try.

37:01.400 --> 37:05.000
This next message is for Calvin and it is from Maria.

37:05.720 --> 37:09.000
And Maria wants to wish Calvin happy 30th birthday Calvin.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.480
Calvin is my sexy nerdy best boyfriend.

37:11.480 --> 37:14.280
Well I hope he's also your only boyfriend.

37:14.280 --> 37:14.600
Yeah.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.640
I went with her.

37:15.640 --> 37:16.680
Why aren't you down with-

37:16.680 --> 37:19.000
You know what you're right Griffin in this day and age.

37:19.000 --> 37:24.680
I hope that she has several wonderful boyfriends but Calvin is the best hands down.

37:24.680 --> 37:28.120
Yeah I mean regardless of how it shakes out that's kind of rude I think.

37:28.840 --> 37:30.680
Calvin's the highlighter he's on top.

37:30.680 --> 37:31.880
I bet he is.

37:31.880 --> 37:32.680
Sexy.

37:34.680 --> 37:39.240
He introduced her to my brother my brother and me on a road trip from Vancouver to Montana.

37:39.240 --> 37:42.760
And you still bring this 30-year-old man to tears laughing.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.120
I think that's once to us.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.920
Oh that's hard to tell.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.920
Semantically I'm confused.

37:48.920 --> 37:53.080

38:27.240 --> 38:27.880
I'm gonna drink it now.

38:27.880 --> 38:33.160
This spring Mary Roach gets refreshed.

38:33.160 --> 38:37.480
Some people like Sprite but I prefer Sierra Mist chapter two.

38:38.920 --> 38:45.560
Brace your brace your bladders we're we're getting 42 ounces of learning into this chapter.

38:45.560 --> 38:48.200
Did you know you can drink things with your vagina chapter three.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.360
Speaking of which there's only one way to get liquidated.

38:52.360 --> 38:58.360
In your vagina I bet and that's with a toy from extremistraints.com not a toy.

38:58.360 --> 39:04.360
It's not a toy you know what I mean toy a screwdriver isn't a toy.

39:04.360 --> 39:08.840
It is a tool that is that is used for a purpose to achieve a goal.

39:09.880 --> 39:10.920
It's all for play.

39:10.920 --> 39:11.880
It's all for fun.

39:11.880 --> 39:15.800
I've never once heard someone say like I'm gonna go buy myself a new sex tool.

39:15.800 --> 39:18.120
Well that's because it's a toy.

39:18.120 --> 39:24.600
I've never once heard someone say like I'm gonna go buy myself a new sex tool well that's because they don't understand.

39:25.720 --> 39:31.080
The word toys appears no fewer than 13 times on the front page of extremistraints.com.

39:31.080 --> 39:36.440
I don't think you know what they don't want to scare people off but orgasms is work.

39:36.440 --> 39:37.080
You know what I mean.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.360
Hey are you sitting down for some sex work.

39:40.360 --> 39:59.640
Extremistraints.com is an adult superstore you might remember them from donating the lube you've been using if you're a maximum fun member but now they're they've they're they're coming for all of your holes with things like the Zeus Deluxe digital power box.

39:59.640 --> 40:03.800
I don't know what it does.

40:03.800 --> 40:04.920
I don't think anyone does.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.600
I think it is digital.

40:06.600 --> 40:11.800
It's not like it's not a puzzle box that you solve and then pleasure demons come and tear your sack apart.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.440
It looks like an off-brand Taiwanese Gameboy.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.440
So I don't think it's that.

40:16.440 --> 40:20.440
It does have optional penis bands if you okay I'm getting it.

40:21.240 --> 40:26.040
Starting to understand how the simple machines interact.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.240
There's a pulley involved.

40:29.240 --> 40:30.760
You put your dick on a wedge.

40:40.120 --> 40:41.640
This is what I was fucking afraid of.

40:41.640 --> 40:42.600
It's not sexy Garfield.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.280
Sexy Garfield's been compromised.

40:44.280 --> 40:46.120
Sexy Garfield has been compromised.

40:46.120 --> 40:46.680
Fanny time.

40:46.680 --> 40:47.400
Fanny time.

40:47.400 --> 40:48.200

40:48.520 --> 41:02.520
Fuck and I did absolutely 100% someone tweeted with MBNBAM and the hashtag Fanny time and I absolutely blocked them from the member of the member of the meme account and my personal account.

41:02.520 --> 41:02.760
Yeah.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.280
That person is dead to me.

41:04.280 --> 41:06.520
I called out like four or five people.

41:06.520 --> 41:06.840
Yeah.

41:06.840 --> 41:07.240
Fucking.

41:07.240 --> 41:10.120
And one person literally said I just want to see if Griffin was paying attention.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.920
We told you not to do that.

41:12.920 --> 41:16.120
Oh actually jokes on him I definitely didn't see that one.

41:16.120 --> 41:17.000
So fuck that guy.

41:17.880 --> 41:19.880
Seriously guys, that's the worst

41:19.880 --> 41:22.280
Please hey. Hey guys. Can you do me a favor and

41:22.960 --> 41:24.960
Not do the opposite of this thing

41:25.400 --> 41:27.600
Yeah, internet fart

41:29.480 --> 41:36.040

42:12.320 --> 42:14.320
Here's another question

42:14.320 --> 42:16.000
Hey brothers three

42:16.000 --> 42:19.720
When I have a bunch of people over to drink at my house, and I wake up before them in the morning

42:19.720 --> 42:23.560
What am I allowed to do can I clean do I have to stay as silent as possible?

42:24.000 --> 42:28.200
That's from the hungover host in st. Paul so these parties that you haven't

42:28.920 --> 42:30.920
Why aren't we invited?

42:31.240 --> 42:35.880
I like this question by the way. I'm this is me all over. I like to wake up early

42:35.880 --> 42:39.800
I don't care if I am hungover. Yeah, I'll power through yeah, you know you're actually if you're hungover

42:39.800 --> 42:41.800
You're more likely to wake up early

42:41.800 --> 42:49.600
um no you clean you clean you don't worry about staying silent because nothing is better than like fucking tearing shit up and getting

42:49.880 --> 42:51.880
real raw and rowdy and

42:52.320 --> 42:55.840
Then you wake up at the morning to a fucking sparkling lemon fresh house

42:55.840 --> 43:01.720
And if you can be the person that facilitates that you're gonna own earn a lot of social capital among your friend

43:01.720 --> 43:06.720
I would I think they're asking like do I need to stay quiet so I don't worry about waking up my drunk

43:06.720 --> 43:11.960
No, no, no if they can't sleep through it, then they're not really hungover. It's a catch-22

43:12.040 --> 43:14.120
They must not have been that tired in the first place

43:14.120 --> 43:19.800
I feel like there's a certain amount of like unspoken social contract where it's like hey if you crash after we just have a wild

43:19.800 --> 43:22.400
Party and trashes my house if you crash on my couch

43:23.160 --> 43:30.160
You help clean up the next day doesn't it seem a little passive-aggressive though to awaken to the party host like oh, no

43:30.160 --> 43:32.160
No stay comfortable

43:32.160 --> 43:37.940
No running a dust buster over your dusty from cleaning up yourself mess

43:37.940 --> 43:42.240
You don't want me to throw up on my dad, but no, please

43:42.800 --> 43:45.700
Stay you look so cozy like a snug bug in a rug

43:45.900 --> 43:51.760
The bigger tactical error that you've made here is if you have a party where everybody's drinking is that your house?

43:52.080 --> 43:57.880
The only best thing you can do is you have to you have to clean up

43:57.880 --> 44:04.120
While you're drunk because you will not it is like a it's like walking

44:04.120 --> 44:07.880
You know walking when you're drunk is like teleporting you think to yourself

44:07.880 --> 44:13.440
I'm gonna go to this place, and then the next thought you have is hey. I'm at this place. That was amazing

44:13.440 --> 44:19.200
That's what cleaning when you're drunk is like because you don't the time does not grate on you. You don't feel it

44:19.200 --> 44:22.760
You're just like in manual. You know you're in you're in autopilot

44:23.280 --> 44:25.440
Why is that coffee table in the front yard?

44:25.440 --> 44:29.600
Shut shut up shut up. I cleaned it clean

44:29.800 --> 44:36.720
This floor was dirty all over it and so I clean I there's more room now has anyone seen the cat

44:36.720 --> 44:43.280
Oh, she cleaned it. That's shit. You tore the ceiling fan out of the ceiling yeah for a ceiling bocce ball

44:44.400 --> 44:51.280
Cleaned it got in the way of ceiling bocce if you're if you're genuinely worried about this just put a put a pan of bacon on

44:51.280 --> 44:55.340
You put a pan of bacon on nobody's gonna be upset about waking up

44:56.020 --> 45:02.700
Everyone's gonna wake up like fucking Wayne Brady and that Folgers commercial like fucking doing little twirls down the hall

45:03.420 --> 45:05.020
ready to roll

45:05.020 --> 45:07.220
I'm still BAC one two one

45:07.780 --> 45:12.060
But I don't fucking care. Yeah, hand me that poem all of let's get real

45:12.700 --> 45:14.780
Let's go. Let's go mr.. Clean on this bitch

45:14.780 --> 45:19.700
Hey, I barfed in the mop water is it it's probably cash, right?

45:21.140 --> 45:23.900
It's probably not good to go anymore right should probably swap that out

45:24.580 --> 45:29.440
Listen, I gotta go to the hospital and get a saline drip. I am NOT gonna come back from this on my own

45:29.940 --> 45:32.780
Do you think fucking bacon the baking council?

45:33.100 --> 45:39.340
We're like a day away from publishing that first commercial that was like the best part of waking up

45:39.340 --> 45:45.580
He's bacon and then fucking Folgers heard they fucking spied on it. It was like we were gonna

45:45.580 --> 45:49.340
Go with the second best thing cuz I mean that's where we fall in the hierarchy

45:49.340 --> 45:54.740
But let's scoop him is there bacon flavored coffee no, but there yeah, I'm sorry. Yes. There is I'm sorry

45:54.740 --> 45:57.600
There's big ironic ironic small business owners

45:57.820 --> 46:04.100
There's at least one that was like fuck it put bacon in it. I think if someone made me Folgers

46:04.100 --> 46:10.660
No as opposed to the being the best part waking up that would actually be the worst thing

46:10.660 --> 46:14.700
They could do for me to me cuz then like I have to drink it

46:14.700 --> 46:19.420
Yeah, I have to drink their Folgers and like you're a Brazilian shit

46:19.420 --> 46:26.760
Right if your coffee comes in a tub bigger than your head you probably are not eating having that gourmet stuff

46:26.760 --> 46:29.080
It's probably not the good stuff. I didn't know that's what you do

46:29.080 --> 46:34.380
I didn't I didn't realize we've gotten so far above our raising Jesus Justin. It's not like instant

46:34.380 --> 46:39.900
But you know I don't think that's what we're working with, but I you know Justin. I'm down here in the real America

46:40.260 --> 46:46.660
Drinking my blue collar just hard-working American from your from your ivory tower in West, Virginia

46:46.660 --> 46:48.660
You could you think you're above everyone

46:49.300 --> 46:53.700
God do you guys even grind your own whole bean coffee? Don't you yeah absolutely?

46:53.700 --> 47:01.200
I know with a bird with the bird coffee grinder. I grind exactly what I need that morning, and I and I and I

47:01.860 --> 47:04.820
Cook it that way you sound like a Frenchman. I

47:05.500 --> 47:08.780
Do like a French roast. I knew it. That's my jam, too

47:08.780 --> 47:12.820
Oh, but I get it from but I get it from HEB. Which is like fucking

47:13.540 --> 47:15.540
Do you get whole bean or you get ground I?

47:16.660 --> 47:18.140
oscillate I

47:18.140 --> 47:20.140
Switch it sometimes

47:20.140 --> 47:23.520
Getting pre-chewed pizza. Yeah, that's the same thing okay?

47:23.520 --> 47:30.440
But whole bean coffee is weaker than pre-ground that doesn't make any sense. Well, okay. You know you have to grind it

47:30.900 --> 47:32.900
This doesn't taste like anything

47:34.560 --> 47:40.200
Sometimes I just eat spoonfuls of coffee just to wake up cuz I'm American what if you jerk off every morning and

47:40.700 --> 47:42.700
Like before you do anything else

47:43.420 --> 47:45.420
You think that becomes the best part of

47:45.420 --> 47:52.500
The best part of waking up is beating it the best in a cup

47:54.140 --> 48:01.660
The best part of waking up is folgers in your cup unless you jerk off every morning before you drink

48:01.660 --> 48:07.460
You folgers it also is somebody making bacon because it could pretty much be number three

48:08.220 --> 48:10.980
Hey brothers three what I have a bunch of people over to drink at my house

48:10.980 --> 48:16.620
And I wake up before them in the morning. What am I allowed to do kind of masturbate or just a silent spa?

48:16.620 --> 48:18.620
Can I masturbate or cook bacon?

48:18.660 --> 48:21.540
You cook the bacon the crackle of the bacon's fat

48:21.980 --> 48:26.820
Provides it provides a smoke screen an audio smoke screen for you to jerk behind

48:26.820 --> 48:31.340
And then the jerking and forgetting that you're cooking the bacon provides a literal smoke screen

48:31.540 --> 48:35.420
Because there's a grease fire in your house worth it though trust me

48:35.420 --> 48:42.140
No one is going to be upset if you wake them up from their hangover sleep because of a grease fire. We gotta get out

48:43.340 --> 48:45.460
Give me like 45 more seconds

48:50.700 --> 48:52.700
You guys want yahoo I do

48:54.020 --> 48:59.340
This yahoo is sending by Caleb Osteen. Thank you Caleb. It's by yahoo answers user Steve Jansen who asks

48:59.340 --> 49:04.980
What song would you listen to on route to eliminate bin Laden?

49:05.460 --> 49:07.620
Now I'm just being a little foolish granted

49:08.380 --> 49:14.340
I'm sure those seals were way too busy to be listening to music having said that I had to ask after hearing about Obama

49:14.340 --> 49:19.020
Coming out to the press dinner to Hulk Hogan's real American did that happen?

49:19.020 --> 49:24.780
I don't remember that so what song would you kick bin Laden's blank blank blank to?

49:24.780 --> 49:31.100
I'm just glad that this person acknowledges their whimsy beforehand if it's not

49:32.140 --> 49:34.060
Christmas shoes

49:34.060 --> 49:37.020
To get real you want to get the world stop turning

49:37.020 --> 49:39.560
What are you even doing cuz you listen to Christmas shoes?

49:39.560 --> 49:42.820
And you think why did his mom have to be so sick on Christmas?

49:42.820 --> 49:49.680
And then you also then you make the leap to it was probably bin Laden's fault, and then it's a vengeance a Christmas shoes vengeance case

49:49.680 --> 49:57.360
Because you put on your your Christmas shoes to put a boot in his ass mm-hmm. I would listen to the theme from night court

49:59.440 --> 50:01.440
You would not see that coming

50:03.360 --> 50:08.360
Yeah, it's got to be the theme to like growing pains or something like that. It's got to be

50:10.000 --> 50:14.200
Well I need something to like remind me of what's so great about America

50:14.200 --> 50:20.520
And there's nothing greater than the fact that Alan thick wrote a theme song for his own television show now

50:20.520 --> 50:27.960
Yes, he is Canadian. I will give you that I will I will see that point to you. I think I would compose my own song

50:29.760 --> 50:33.960
How would that go trap I think just I don't know because I would have to be inspired by the moment

50:33.960 --> 50:41.280
But I'm saying as I take I assume a chopper of some kind sitting in a chopper with my best friends

50:41.280 --> 50:44.120
on a mission from a god

50:49.040 --> 50:52.720
My best friend is really a gun

50:53.200 --> 50:58.520
He's always been there for me. It's jump by van halen a little gauche

50:58.520 --> 51:02.820
I feel like if I if I was bumping that so loud through my maximum fun earbuds

51:03.000 --> 51:06.960
That I got through the max fun drive and like my compatriots heard it

51:06.960 --> 51:10.460
They would look at me like come on man have a little respect for the guy

51:10.460 --> 51:14.440
I know I think the appropriate song is no diggity by Blackstreet

51:15.320 --> 51:18.040
What song are you guys most embarrassed?

51:18.600 --> 51:20.600
That gets you psyched up on

51:21.520 --> 51:25.120
Unironically pumped by what that would be gold Trans Am by Kesha

51:26.120 --> 51:32.220
And then ironically I said oh yeah completely unironically. I'm a huge Kesha fan. Does that get you like pumped though?

51:32.320 --> 51:34.640
Yeah, if I can get it's the fucking jam

51:34.640 --> 51:35.160
Okay

51:35.160 --> 51:40.760
So that gets you and it's all about America like she references fucking like Lynyrd Skynyrd and shit in there like magic carpet ride

51:40.760 --> 51:42.600
I really like

51:42.600 --> 51:45.880
That Harlem Shake song except. I like everything before

51:46.720 --> 51:51.200
That drop I like everything like the build-up is so great and the drop

51:51.200 --> 51:54.560
I feel like kind of lets me down a little bit. I usually just stop those videos right there

51:54.560 --> 51:58.360
I really don't get that I don't get it. I don't get it

51:58.360 --> 52:04.860
It's more fun to stop it before it gets the drop and just pretend like it's a person only I can see

52:05.360 --> 52:10.400
Yeah, and no one else in the room is aware of that person's presence. Sometimes I'll listen to the streak

52:16.800 --> 52:23.560
While you're killing Osama bin Laden, yeah, that's like that's like my that's what gives me a murder boner if you're gonna listen

52:23.560 --> 52:25.560
I mean if you're gonna listen to

52:25.560 --> 52:31.680
What's that motherfucker's name? Ray Stevens if you're gonna listen to a Ray Stevens song about

52:32.000 --> 52:37.960
While you're killing Osama bin Laden. Yeah, why would you not listen to Osama yo mama? I know it's the obvious

52:37.960 --> 52:43.700
It's the obvious choice. I I don't know. I'll tell you what I wouldn't listen to is the soundtrack to Zero Dark Thirty snooze fest

52:44.100 --> 52:46.100
Where's the fucking?

52:46.200 --> 52:49.320
Where's the right? Where's the trit? You know what I mean?

52:50.040 --> 52:53.880
You want like one and like even if it's just one tune

52:53.880 --> 53:01.200
like a suit song when they tried to tie for true shred as soon as Andy Dwyer puts two in his chest I

53:01.440 --> 53:08.280
Want it to be like fucking got him for freedom and like that's the only part of that movie where something like that happens

53:08.680 --> 53:11.480
Especially if it was just that just a musical sting

53:13.440 --> 53:20.240
So motion as he fell to the floor like take that for 9-eleven you dick and then that's

53:20.240 --> 53:28.200
Yeah, that's a cut to black don't and then it got nominated for best song. Don't look Ethel. They call him the street

53:30.400 --> 53:32.400
Tarzan

53:37.200 --> 53:39.400
Selma got run over by a reindeer

53:39.400 --> 53:49.840
You would have to change the ending of that movie for that song to work there cuz it's yeah, it's Christmas is when it happened

53:50.440 --> 53:52.740
God, wouldn't that be the best Christmas present of all?

53:53.400 --> 53:58.560
Said the world's greatest evil perpetrator got this take care of

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
What if they called that movie taking care of business

54:02.000 --> 54:09.240
And he's like well TCB going back to Pawnee and

54:10.080 --> 54:14.040
Then but they can't play taking care of business because the rights are too expensive

54:15.120 --> 54:18.240
They belong to office man. They belong to office took care of business

54:19.720 --> 54:25.920
You're the one the business man the second song on Ray Stevens a summer

54:25.920 --> 54:30.600
Yo mama album is called hang up and drive. I bet that's fucking funny

54:30.600 --> 54:34.160
Don't you think that that's probably a pretty funny song?

54:34.160 --> 54:40.920
I just want to say how proud I am of Ray Stevens for really taking on the hard-hitting issues. Yeah, he's fighting. He's fighting

54:41.920 --> 54:46.280
Irrelevance with every bone in his body. You can't ban my plastic bags

54:50.240 --> 54:56.640
There's a plastic bag ban in Austin, I don't know maybe it hasn't reached you you fucking gas

54:57.520 --> 54:58.840

56:35.000 --> 56:40.080
I would also like to point out that Justin has more Twitter followers than blues traveler

56:40.320 --> 56:44.440
Wow, just what that's Justin did write the mid 90s hit hook

56:44.440 --> 56:47.240
He did write run around. Oh, no, wait

56:48.080 --> 56:50.520

It's a departure off the album putting the days to bed. God. I mean, what is there to what is there to say?

57:57.200 --> 58:02.520
What is there to say that hasn't been said? I believe it was Einstein that said everything's been said already

58:03.200 --> 58:10.560
They're the best. I don't Roderick is the Ray Stevens of our time. He is God. Don't look helpful. That's the truth. What about a
