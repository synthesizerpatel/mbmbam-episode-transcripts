00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.640
Hello friends, welcome to my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.640 --> 00:55.280
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy, and we are California bound. California!

00:55.280 --> 01:04.480
California! Here we come! A natural phantom planet soprano.

01:06.160 --> 01:10.160
Travis, when you said you were going to get a castration for this episode,

01:10.160 --> 01:15.200
I doubted you, and now I am completely and utterly doubting you.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.640
That's fair, I had it reversed.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.880
I don't think you can transplant that particular gland.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.200
I did, and then I had it put back.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.960
Right, that's what a transplant is, and I don't- I'm saying that that's not-

01:26.960 --> 01:30.160
It wasn't really a transplant because I didn't have it switched out with anything.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.000
It was more just like a brief hiatus.

01:32.560 --> 01:39.680
I don't- but again, I don't think you can pause the existence of your dong- of your donger.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.080
I want to give some free advice to people about packing.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.080
This is starting the advice earlier than we normally do, but you should-

01:50.080 --> 01:56.880
The first thing you pack should be the last thing you'd want to ask someone at the front desk for,

01:56.880 --> 01:59.600
and in my case, that's always Preparation H.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.920
That's the number one thing that I always pack first to make sure it's in there.

02:03.920 --> 02:10.320
Justin's luggage could be characterized by the number of shame cubbies built into it.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.880
Oh man, it's secrets upon secrets upon secrets.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.760
It's like, you know that movie Heavy Weights when they're like,

02:15.760 --> 02:18.880
all right, let me check your bunk for food, and he checks the bunk for food,

02:18.880 --> 02:25.200
and they're like, no food here, and they leave, and then these fat fucks pull lifesavers and

02:25.200 --> 02:30.800
gummy candies and snacky treats out of every orifice of their luggage and their beds and

02:30.800 --> 02:32.080
the furniture in the room.

02:32.080 --> 02:32.640
That's pretty much-

02:32.640 --> 02:34.720
Mine's like that, but for anal treatments.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.640
My suitcase is like the life of Gary Glitter.

02:38.640 --> 02:43.280
It's just- just when you think there's not another place for embarrassment to hide, there it is.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.680
Man, you make a lot of references to that person that few people know who they are.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.600
That's right.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.440
Everybody knows who Gary Glitter is.

02:51.440 --> 02:51.920
Come on.

02:51.920 --> 02:51.920
No.

02:52.880 --> 02:53.440
Come on.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.080
Probably not.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.400
Are you guys psyched to go to the left coast?

02:57.120 --> 02:57.520
I am.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.160
I'm ready.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.720
I'm not looking for that time change, though.

03:00.720 --> 03:06.640
Well, actually, I was listening to Stuff You Should Know, and they were talking about jet lag,

03:06.640 --> 03:11.280
and basically what you gotta do is, as you're flying over the country,

03:11.280 --> 03:12.960
you gotta stab yourself in the leg.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.400
I don't think you were listening right.

03:16.400 --> 03:21.280
No, you stab yourself in the leg, and then the pain distracts your brain from the time change.

03:21.280 --> 03:24.000
Okay, so then you get there, and it's still three hours earlier.

03:24.560 --> 03:25.920
Yeah, but like, you're bleeding.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.880
You're frequently blacking out, and that helps with the sleep deprivation.

03:30.880 --> 03:31.200
Yes, that's true.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.240
Listen, this comes straight from Chuck and Josh, and they travel a lot.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.680
I think it comes like fourth hand through Chuck and Josh.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.600
No, no, no, it's what they said.

03:39.600 --> 03:43.200
Travis, I'm gonna look in Chuck's face within the next five days,

03:43.200 --> 03:45.040
and I will ask him if you're lying to me.

03:45.040 --> 03:48.880
Now, he may not remember it, because it was from a secret bonus episode

03:48.880 --> 03:51.520
that they beamed directly into my brain while I was sleeping.

03:51.520 --> 03:51.760
Okay.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.760
Is that how you found out about 9-11 being an inside job also?

03:55.760 --> 03:57.360
Yep, from Chuck and Josh.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.640
Well, brain Chuck and Josh.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.520
Did you guys introduce yourselves?

04:01.520 --> 04:02.480
I'm Griffin McElroy.

04:02.480 --> 04:08.320
I'm the only non-delusional person other than Justin on this podcast.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.840
And I'm Travis McElroy.

04:10.480 --> 04:10.800
Okay.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.120
The end.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.080
Period.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.040
Period.

04:15.040 --> 04:16.400
I'm in high school frequently.

04:16.400 --> 04:19.280
I'm complimented on my appearance while wearing formal wear.

04:19.280 --> 04:19.680
We get it.

04:19.680 --> 04:20.960
Suit, tuxedo.

04:25.360 --> 04:36.640
However, the call to wear nice clothing is limited.

04:36.640 --> 04:42.480
How can I dress nice more frequently so as to appease my vanity without being a dick about it?

04:42.480 --> 04:47.840
Is there even a way to dress nice on a normal day without giving someone the douche chills?

04:47.840 --> 04:51.920
Or do I have to become that weirdo who always wears dress shirts?

04:51.920 --> 04:52.960
And that's from Gmail.

04:54.560 --> 04:54.960
This is...

04:54.960 --> 04:56.400
Oh, God.

04:56.400 --> 05:00.560
I mean, there is, but not in fucking high school, for sure.

05:00.560 --> 05:01.200
Yeah, that's the thing.

05:01.200 --> 05:05.360
Like, I have a friend, my friend Jeremy, he dresses nice every day.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.360
He's also a goddamn adult.

05:07.360 --> 05:07.840
Yeah, that's the thing.

05:07.840 --> 05:11.040
And so, like, he's like, oh, that's a well-put-together dude.

05:11.040 --> 05:14.240
Not like a 15-year-old who's getting above his raisin.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.280
Even in college.

05:15.280 --> 05:20.480
College is really, like, a $15,000 a year reason to wear sweatpants all the time.

05:20.480 --> 05:26.480
And, like, when you raise the bar by, you know, slapping some suspenders on...

05:27.840 --> 05:28.640
And I'm gonna be...

05:28.640 --> 05:29.600
I'm gonna be straight with you.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.080
Here's some harsh truth, because I know this.

05:32.080 --> 05:35.760
When I work in the shop, right, and I'm usually wearing, like, my grungy paint jeans,

05:35.760 --> 05:37.760
and that's what everybody sees me in every day,

05:37.760 --> 05:40.560
then on the days when, like, we're opening a new show and I dress up,

05:40.560 --> 05:42.000
yeah, I get a lot of compliments.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.920
Because the unspoken thing is, you look better than normal.

05:46.640 --> 05:47.520
That's why you're getting...

05:47.520 --> 05:49.840
Oh my god, you clean up nice, right?

05:49.840 --> 05:52.640
The number of pretty woman switcheroos you are capable...

05:52.640 --> 06:00.240
The number of she's all that alterations you can swing when you're fancy all the time,

06:00.800 --> 06:02.880
every time, is zero.

06:02.880 --> 06:03.360
Because everybody expects...

06:03.360 --> 06:06.640
So if you're fancy all the time, no one's gonna compliment you.

06:06.640 --> 06:12.320
When you're fancy 90% of the time, that one day where you do just want to throw on some cargo shorts,

06:12.320 --> 06:14.160
you're gonna do a reverse she's all that.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.760
Oh, she's not that.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.080
She isn't anything, is what you're gonna pull.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.400
Nowhere near the idea of that.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.280
It's like that...

06:21.280 --> 06:22.880
Who's that broad with the glasses?

06:22.880 --> 06:24.800
Oh man, it's her?

06:24.800 --> 06:27.520
Who knew an uggle was under all that attractiveness all the time?

06:27.520 --> 06:29.920
She used to be so fit.

06:29.920 --> 06:30.720
What happened?

06:30.720 --> 06:32.080
It's just the glasses, but...

06:32.080 --> 06:33.680
Are those pencils in her hair?

06:33.680 --> 06:34.080
Ew.

06:34.640 --> 06:35.360
No, thanks.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.160
Ew.

06:36.160 --> 06:41.120
Well, the problem with dressing like that in high school is that everyone is gonna assume

06:41.120 --> 06:43.280
that your mom dressed you like that.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.320
They're gonna assume your mom...

06:44.320 --> 06:45.040
Well, I don't know.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.240
Here's the thing.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.760
I think there's a casual dress.

06:47.760 --> 06:53.760
I think that there are button up shirts that aren't dress shirts that you can wear with jeans

06:53.760 --> 06:59.280
and be well put together and take care of yourself without going full suit and tie every day.

06:59.280 --> 06:59.840
Yeah.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.200
He's on that suit and tie shit.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.560
Here's the thing though.

07:02.560 --> 07:07.760
Because I'm speaking from my experience of when I was in high school in 1982,

07:08.960 --> 07:11.120
the game has changed, I bet.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.440
Because do you guys know about swag?

07:15.040 --> 07:15.520
Yeah.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.520
I have a passing familiarity.

07:17.520 --> 07:17.840
Okay.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.400
I think that this might be a swag thing.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.920
I think this might be a swag.

07:21.920 --> 07:26.880
Because this kid, I bet, if he rolls up in high school with his suit and tie shit...

07:26.880 --> 07:31.280
Because Justin Timberlake just did that song about it, so kids know that.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.120
Kids love his music.

07:33.840 --> 07:37.200
You roll up to school in your prom best.

07:37.840 --> 07:38.560
I think that people...

07:38.560 --> 07:41.360
I think you're gonna turn some heads and in a good way nowadays.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.720
Wait, I have an idea.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.200
Okay.

07:43.200 --> 07:43.600
Okay.

07:43.600 --> 07:48.480
And this will help protect you from wearing it out because you dress nice every day and losing

07:48.480 --> 07:53.680
the effectiveness and simultaneously keep it interesting for all your friends.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.280
Bring your suit and tie with you.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.240
Keep it at school.

07:56.240 --> 07:59.520
And then just change for one period out of every day and then change back.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.320
You know, baby, it's social studies.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.920
I gotta look my best.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.320
And when they're like, wait, hold on.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.680
And you're like, excuse me, what?

08:07.680 --> 08:09.760
No, I've been wearing jeans and t-shirt all day.

08:10.320 --> 08:16.160
This is, again, I feel like we have to return to an old classic rule here.

08:17.680 --> 08:21.280
None of our advice is applicable if you are hugely physically attractive.

08:21.280 --> 08:21.680
Yes.

08:21.680 --> 08:27.360
Because, again, if you're really physically just very, very pleasing to the eye,

08:27.360 --> 08:30.960
you can wear a suit and basically just run the school.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.960
I mean, you'll basically be running the school.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.680
Ooh, watch out for the catch me if you can effect, though,

08:35.680 --> 08:37.360
where everyone thinks you're a substitute teacher.

08:37.360 --> 08:42.080
When you say watch out, you mean try as hard as you possibly can to emulate, right?

08:42.080 --> 08:42.560
Yes.

08:42.560 --> 08:44.480
Because I don't remember a lot about that movie,

08:44.480 --> 08:47.440
but I do remember that he got copious amounts of trim.

08:48.320 --> 08:48.960
There was that.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.240
Nigh on offensive amounts of trim.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.000
That was the 60s, though.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.160
That's all right.

08:56.160 --> 09:00.880
All you had to do was put on a fucking pilot hat, and it was trim central.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.520
You could go to a cheap Halloween dime store

09:04.080 --> 09:08.160
and then get the requisite materials to make a trim volcano.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.320
Oh, God, why were we born when we were born?

09:12.960 --> 09:13.360
I know.

09:14.160 --> 09:17.200
Back then, if you didn't wear a suit to school, you got beat up.

09:17.200 --> 09:17.760
Exactly.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.680
Yeah, I don't think you can.

09:21.680 --> 09:25.040
And also, you know what, I'm not sure that's going to be pretty high budget

09:25.040 --> 09:28.560
to like the way you look, I guarantee it, every day,

09:28.560 --> 09:34.560
and still have a wide variety of looks to where it's not like

09:35.440 --> 09:38.880
that kid is poor but in a really weird way where his parents bought him one suit.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.320
Oh, you don't want it to be an affectation.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.640
We're like, that's the guy that wears that tuxedo every day.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.240
It has to be an affectation, though.

09:44.240 --> 09:48.160
I mean, clothing is all about appropriateness, right?

09:48.160 --> 09:51.600
You can dress up or not as the situation demands.

09:51.600 --> 09:57.200
This is why we say on invitations like casual or Jimmy Buffett inspired or formal.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.480
Nobody has ever—

09:58.480 --> 10:01.360
Jimmy Buffett has never invited people to a Jimmy Buffett.

10:01.360 --> 10:05.840
Jimmy Buffett is metacognizant of how bad his shit is.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.480
Wouldn't it be a real mindfuck, though,

10:08.480 --> 10:12.480
if it turned out that Jimmy Buffett's style was full black tie affair?

10:13.120 --> 10:16.240
And you got there and your parrot shirt and everything,

10:16.240 --> 10:19.520
and I was like, you misread it and it actually said Warren Buffett.

10:21.440 --> 10:22.480
God damn it.

10:22.480 --> 10:23.120
Did it again.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.120
How about another question?

10:25.120 --> 10:26.560
You guys want to help another person?

10:26.560 --> 10:27.200
Do you want to Yahoo?

10:27.200 --> 10:28.720
Because I got actually like a shit ton.

10:28.720 --> 10:29.440
People came in.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.960
I know I had to fucking read through all of them.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.360
People responded in full fucking force.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.160
Thank you to everybody.

10:36.160 --> 10:40.400
I'm probably going to be dipping into this week's stash for a while, so thank you all.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.320
Let's kick things off.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.920
This one was sent in actually by two people, by Andrew Jones and Oliver Hill.

10:45.920 --> 10:46.560
Thank you, guys.

10:47.200 --> 10:47.840
It's by Yahoo!

10:47.840 --> 10:49.600
Insta's user, Turd, who asks.

10:52.640 --> 10:53.520
You're done.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.320
That's it.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.440
Who asks, how can I get my dad to be cool?

10:59.840 --> 11:02.000
He's a really shy, nerdy guy.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.080
He's like 50, so can he really change?

11:04.880 --> 11:08.320
My mom walks all over him, and it makes me sad to see that my father is not a real man.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.600
Yes, he's a responsible man and a kind man, but not a real man.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.040
I want to teach him how to be cool and not so uptight.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.680
He needs to start hitting the gym, going out to socialize,

11:17.680 --> 11:21.680
and maybe pick up a fun hobby like pool hustling or joining a motorcycle gang.

11:21.680 --> 11:22.480
Oh, my God.

11:23.680 --> 11:24.000
50?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.800
Any too late to just fucking switch it and change it?

11:26.800 --> 11:28.560
We're talking about a dad's all that, right?

11:30.160 --> 11:32.000
Dad, take those glasses off.

11:32.000 --> 11:32.960
Oh, shit.

11:32.960 --> 11:33.920
You're a stigmatism.

11:33.920 --> 11:34.800
I forgot.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.400
Hey, Dad, get off that riding lawn mower.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.200
Can't buy me, Dad.

11:38.320 --> 11:38.720
Come on.

11:39.680 --> 11:40.720
Let me clean you right up.

11:41.680 --> 11:42.560
Oh, my goodness.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.440
Hey, Dad of the Year, was that the Rick Moranis movie?

11:45.440 --> 11:46.880
What was the Rick Moranis movie?

11:47.840 --> 11:48.880
That was Honey, I Shrunk the Dad.

11:48.880 --> 11:49.600
Shrunk the Kid.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.440
No, it was Honey, I Shrunk My Swag.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.040
Honey, I Blew Up My Swag.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.040
How can you get your 50-year-old...

11:59.040 --> 12:02.880
Well, first of all, you're going to have to have a frank conversation with him.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.240
With your dad, Frank.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.400
If your dad's name is Frank, it helps to say,

12:07.600 --> 12:09.360
listen, you have raised me.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.360
You're kind and you're responsible.

12:11.360 --> 12:16.080
I know my mom's walks all over you, but I respect what you've done for me and my family.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.920
But fuck you are lame.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.360
Manzos, you just...

12:20.080 --> 12:22.720
Man, I look at you and it's just...

12:23.680 --> 12:28.080
You're just a pitiful husk of negative manliness.

12:29.040 --> 12:34.960
The stork has not been kind enough to bless me with a baby from the cabbage patch, but I am 32.

12:34.960 --> 12:35.360
Right.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.240
So I would...

12:36.240 --> 12:38.000
I can't address something for you.

12:38.000 --> 12:48.480
But I can tell you, your dad is 100% aware at every waking moment how uncool he has become.

12:48.480 --> 12:54.160
This is not a wake up one day and you have those socks with...

12:55.280 --> 12:57.200
You have argyle socks on.

12:57.840 --> 13:06.480
This is a slow descent from relevance that started like in his late 20s and just kind of got...

13:06.480 --> 13:08.160
Maybe, but maybe he's in full...

13:08.160 --> 13:11.600
I would bet statistically though, at some point, he was probably cool.

13:12.240 --> 13:12.880
That's the thing.

13:12.880 --> 13:13.920
He might be still...

13:13.920 --> 13:16.240
He might be in full blown dad denial.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.440
He might be in dad Nile.

13:18.720 --> 13:19.920
He might be like the biggest...

13:19.920 --> 13:22.400
Dad Nile is just not a river in Egypt.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.080
I know, it's not...

13:24.080 --> 13:25.120
It's not at all.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.160
It's not dad at all.

13:27.360 --> 13:31.840
He might be like a big parrot head and that might be like a mainstay from his youth.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.440
And he might just think like, I fucking get it.

13:35.440 --> 13:41.520
The world is moving in the wrong direction and that direction is away from Jimmy Buffett's relevance.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.080
I am still on the fucking cutting, bleeding edge.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.480
Is this gonna be a Buffett full episode?

13:46.480 --> 13:47.040
Maybe.

13:47.040 --> 13:47.920
It's his birthday.

13:49.040 --> 13:49.540
What?

13:50.560 --> 13:51.280
Do you know what I mean?

13:51.280 --> 13:54.800
There are those dads out there that are like, oh yeah, man.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.680
I saw the Eagles three times last year and it fucking changed.

13:57.680 --> 14:00.480
Like, that's not...

14:01.120 --> 14:04.720
That is literally only your definition of cool.

14:04.720 --> 14:08.320
Even the Eagles don't think that that's cool.

14:09.120 --> 14:09.840
The Eagles know better.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.040
The Eagles are like, here's the thing.

14:11.040 --> 14:15.360
We need to talk about your Eagles consumption, the Eagles said to the Eagles fan.

14:15.360 --> 14:19.040
The other side of this coin is so much more embarrassing

14:19.040 --> 14:24.480
that if you had a dad who suddenly just rolled up one day in full on like leather outfit

14:24.480 --> 14:27.920
and biker gear and like we ride in the motorcycle and he was like,

14:27.920 --> 14:32.560
hey kids, let's go check out the concert scene.

14:32.560 --> 14:36.400
Like, hey kids, does anybody here like Drake?

14:36.400 --> 14:38.480
And then he fans out some Drake tickets.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.960
Yeah, you're not gonna be more proud of him.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.240
I would actually, that would be...

14:42.240 --> 14:43.760
That would be pretty fucking great.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.840
If my dad rode his motorcycle from Ironton, Ohio to Austin, Texas

14:47.840 --> 14:51.280
and then fanned out a fucking fistful of Drake tickets.

14:51.280 --> 14:54.240
I don't even, I don't know a single Drake song, but I would say yes.

14:54.240 --> 14:57.120
And I would hop on the back of that Harley and we would go have the best time of our life.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.160
Right in the sunset.

14:58.160 --> 15:07.680
But your dad has to let his swag go for his children to become,

15:07.680 --> 15:10.000
I mean, the universe has a finite amount of swag.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.240
Everybody knows this, that's in the secret,

15:12.800 --> 15:20.240
but he has to let some of it go for you to become as fresh as you can be in your life.

15:20.240 --> 15:25.200
He regurgitated his swag into your open baby mouths when you were born.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.320
And that is, and that's how you got the swag that you have.

15:28.320 --> 15:32.880
He transferred it to you like some sort of Highlander, but also a mama bird.

15:32.880 --> 15:33.440
Kind of makes it up there.

15:33.440 --> 15:39.520
So the best thing you can do in your life then is to live your life

15:39.520 --> 15:42.160
as cool as possible as a tribute to him.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.960
To your dad's fallen swag?

15:44.960 --> 15:45.520
Mm-hmm.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.840
You're gonna pick it up and take his mantle?

15:47.840 --> 15:52.560
And when you win the swag awards that I assume Spike TV probably gives out,

15:52.560 --> 15:56.720
then you can stand on stage and say, this swag's for you, dad.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.080
And your dad's in the audience like,

15:58.080 --> 16:00.560
Mm, cool, thanks, son.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.240
And he pulls out a calculator.

16:02.240 --> 16:05.280
Why do you have a fucking calculator with the swag awards?

16:05.280 --> 16:08.080
Because you won the swag awards.

16:08.080 --> 16:12.000
Your dad has just fully become Booger for Revenge of the Nexus.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.040
Oh, God.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.840
But wait a second, who's sitting next to him at the swag awards?

16:15.840 --> 16:16.640
It's Drake.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.360
Drake sees him.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.040
He's like, I'm changing my whole look.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.320
Goes full Booger.

16:20.320 --> 16:24.640
All of a sudden, your dad becomes the definition of swag.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.000
Ouroboros.

16:26.000 --> 16:26.880
Wait, what's so good?

16:26.880 --> 16:30.720
Does your swag begin to drain away as his swag increases?

16:30.720 --> 16:31.760
Is it inversely proportional?

16:31.760 --> 16:34.000
It's the swag of Dorian Gray.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.160
You're just putting your swag into a painting.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.800
Somewhere there's a painting of my dad getting less swag.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.560
Is our dad swag, do you think?

16:42.560 --> 16:43.040
Oh, yeah.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.640
Yeah, I think he's still pretty...

16:44.640 --> 16:46.960
I mean, he's got a pretty big collection of hero clicks.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.400
Oh, yeah.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.120
I think he's got...

16:51.120 --> 16:52.640
I mean, he's got a great office.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.640
He's got a cool look.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.840
He's got Twitter.

16:55.840 --> 16:56.720
He's on that game.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.000
He's good on Twitter, guys.

16:59.120 --> 17:02.560
Yeah,.kerm, if you don't follow him, D-O-C-C-U-R-M.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.600
Follow our dad.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.400
Follow our dad.

17:04.400 --> 17:04.960
He'll teach you.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.400
Now we got to charge him for that.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.280
He's really good at...

17:08.720 --> 17:14.160
He does a YouTube instructional video series on fancy basketball dribbles you can do.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.800
He doesn't.

17:16.800 --> 17:21.040
He has a whole series about sweet ways to roll blunts.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.640
He'll roll specialty blunts like that.

17:24.640 --> 17:29.280
He has a whole thing where he does the a cappella versions of a cappella songs.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.000
It's really weird.

17:32.160 --> 17:34.960
He harmonizes with himself in video editing.

17:34.960 --> 17:35.760
It's pretty weird.

17:35.760 --> 17:38.320
He's got a whole thing, a whole scene going on.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.640
I want to throw out two special thanks this week.

17:40.640 --> 17:40.960
Okay.

17:40.960 --> 17:47.520
To Libby Sanders and Ben Masick, because both of them sent in farm wisdom.

17:47.520 --> 17:48.480
Oh, shit.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.200
Share that with us.

17:49.200 --> 17:49.840
Yeah.

17:49.840 --> 17:54.000
Libby Sanders sent me some pictures of cows and baby birds and stuff, which is awesome.

17:55.360 --> 17:56.080
Is that wisdom?

17:56.720 --> 18:01.040
Well, she also said that apparently roosters fucking crow all day long.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.160
Okay, so the myth is...

18:02.160 --> 18:03.040
Not just in the morning.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.160
Okay, that's bullshit.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.720
Why would anybody want that bird?

18:06.720 --> 18:09.680
It's like an alarm you can't turn off.

18:09.680 --> 18:10.160
I know.

18:10.160 --> 18:10.720
I know.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.800
Here's some farm secrets from Ben.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.760
Cows lay down right before it's about to rain.

18:17.920 --> 18:22.000
And I want to get some proof on this, but if you bail hay when it's wet,

18:22.000 --> 18:25.920
don't stack it in the loft because it can set fire to the barn.

18:25.920 --> 18:26.160
How?

18:26.720 --> 18:27.200
What?

18:27.200 --> 18:28.000
I don't know.

18:28.560 --> 18:29.200
That doesn't make sense.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.880
Farm wisdom is crazy.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.680
And then he sent me a picture of a cow, which I appreciate.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.840
We did specifically ask for that.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.480
I really like pictures of cows.

18:38.480 --> 18:39.280
Yeah.

18:39.280 --> 18:42.320
But not when they're like on Google image search already, because like,

18:42.880 --> 18:45.920
I don't want a picture of a cow that a bunch of people have already looked at.

18:46.640 --> 18:52.560
Oh, also Jordan Brown sent in some pictures of cows and farm wisdoms and such,

18:52.560 --> 18:53.760
and I appreciate it.

18:53.760 --> 18:54.320
But are these like...

18:54.320 --> 18:54.960
Thank you, Jordan.

18:54.960 --> 18:58.480
Are these like original JPEGs that they themselves captured?

18:58.480 --> 19:00.960
These are pictures they took of their farms.

19:00.960 --> 19:01.120
Okay.

19:01.120 --> 19:04.480
I'm going to have to, for now on, ask farmers that write in to please

19:04.480 --> 19:08.160
write NBNBAM on your cow so we know that your image is legit.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.280
And like today's date.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.360
I just recently started dating a wonderful girl.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.240
A wonderful girl.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.120
She's two and I'm two also.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.240
I love girls.

19:18.800 --> 19:19.760
I loved him.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.160
Her cooties are so cute.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.320
I have a small issue though.

19:24.320 --> 19:28.560
She's a professional wrestler, like the powerbomb to a table kind of wrestler,

19:28.560 --> 19:31.120
which don't get me wrong, that's freaking awesome.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.960
But it comes with a slight side effect.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.640
She loves play fighting.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.640
Now, I like to play fight.

19:36.640 --> 19:39.920
But the problem is sometimes she gets a little too into it,

19:39.920 --> 19:42.480
and she starts to hit a bit hard on occasion.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.440
Play fighting is fun, but getting punched in the gut is not.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.480
Help, brothers.

19:46.480 --> 19:49.200
How do I get my punch love girlfriend to pull her punches?

19:49.200 --> 19:50.240
That's from Gmail.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.240
Oh, honey, please don't bring your work home.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.480
Time is for us.

19:54.480 --> 19:54.960
Leave it at the office.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.400
How about you tell that, like...

19:58.080 --> 20:00.320
Which doesn't just go, ow.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.840
Or just go, hey, don't fucking punch me.

20:03.840 --> 20:06.800
It's a pretty good way to stop people from punching.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.960
Hey, if you would stop fucking pun-

20:08.960 --> 20:10.160
Like, I get it.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.560
You're play fighting, but are you?

20:12.560 --> 20:13.520
Is it play for her?

20:14.320 --> 20:14.800
Or is it-

20:14.800 --> 20:15.280
No, it's work.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.080
She's on the clock.

20:16.080 --> 20:21.360
It's either training or it's subtle psychosexual dominance

20:21.360 --> 20:26.560
that she is putting in there, putting in your relationship.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.040
Here's the problem, Punchy.

20:29.040 --> 20:33.920
Your problem is you should have said something the first time she did it.

20:33.920 --> 20:36.320
Because now when you bring it up, she's going to feel bad.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.200
She's going to be like, I've been punching you for six months.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.400
Why didn't you say anything?

20:40.400 --> 20:40.960
I get it.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.480
But like, we got to take gender out of this equation.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.400
We got to be gender blind on this one.

20:46.400 --> 20:46.800
I agree.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.600
I feel like hitting isn't the right answer.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.360
Hitting's not good.

20:51.360 --> 20:52.400
Use your words.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.760
Unless you are getting paid for it, which apparently she is doing.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.880
Yeah, you know, you're getting some professional hits.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.400
You're getting it.

21:00.400 --> 21:04.320
I mean, people pay big money to see her hit people like that.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.320
I mean, you're getting it all for free.

21:06.320 --> 21:07.760
Maybe you should be a little more grateful.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.600
It just seems very, this seems like a really dangerous, I mean, obviously like-

21:13.600 --> 21:15.280
It's how fucking Houdini died.

21:15.920 --> 21:16.400
Yes.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.120
Thank you, Griffin.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.800
That's absolutely true.

21:19.600 --> 21:20.240
You know what I mean?

21:20.240 --> 21:25.600
This guy might be the fucking escape artist extraordinaire of our time.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.720
And we'll never know.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.720
His girlfriend punches his liver to death.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.040
God, this makes me upset.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.400
Don't punch anyone.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.440
Hey, everybody, even in play, don't punch anyone.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.040
I don't know what else to say about it.

21:37.040 --> 21:42.560
Just tell her that it hurts and that like, get that like male ego bullshit.

21:42.560 --> 21:47.200
Like if this is legitimately an issue that is driving a wedge between you,

21:47.200 --> 21:52.240
that the punches she does to your tummy hurts your tummy and it makes you sad,

21:52.880 --> 21:54.640
just say all those words to her.

21:54.640 --> 21:57.120
That is specifically all those words I just said.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.080
Hey, hon.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.040
Hey, please don't hit me.

21:59.040 --> 21:59.520
It hurts.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.040
In the tummy, it makes it sad.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.080
It makes it-

22:02.080 --> 22:04.160
I gotta think, I think that maybe you have to do away

22:04.160 --> 22:05.600
with this whole part of your relationship.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.720
The whole play fighting thing.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.320
I think you have to probably let that go.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.600
Is it possible?

22:12.400 --> 22:14.400
I don't want to, I don't want to play psychologist,

22:14.400 --> 22:21.040
but is it possible that like she as a person has like physical issues

22:21.040 --> 22:23.680
where like that's just, she's, that's how she displays-

22:23.680 --> 22:25.200
I, well, maybe the issue-

22:25.200 --> 22:28.880
You're saying, you're saying she's a caveman is your-

22:28.880 --> 22:31.600
Well, I'm saying that maybe like, maybe it's not,

22:31.600 --> 22:37.120
we're looking at it as like her violence is stemming from her profession,

22:37.120 --> 22:38.640
but maybe it's the other way around.

22:38.640 --> 22:43.680
Maybe she picked a profession that allowed her an outlet for like her physical nature.

22:43.680 --> 22:48.720
Maybe the issue is that she's fully ripped up fucking biodiesel.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.240
Uh-huh.

22:50.240 --> 22:56.400
And because of that, it makes her happy to express her desality

22:57.120 --> 23:01.040
by going full blown beast mode on her boyfriend's tummy tom.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.040
That's exactly what I was saying.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.080
Thank you for translating.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.880
Well, just say it in like fucking human speak next time.

23:08.080 --> 23:08.400
Fair enough.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.880
Why don't you put the fucking those little glasses

23:10.880 --> 23:13.360
that only cover the bridge of your nose away

23:13.360 --> 23:15.520
and pull out your fucking ZZ Top Shades.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.600
How will I read my spreadsheets?

23:17.600 --> 23:18.720
Right, that's what I'm saying.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.240
This is a spreadsheet free podcast.

23:20.240 --> 23:23.760
You gotta give the people the common, the common words.

23:24.960 --> 23:25.520
Fair enough.

23:25.520 --> 23:25.840
Like fuck.

23:25.840 --> 23:28.080
All of my words will come from common from now on.

23:28.080 --> 23:28.720
Okay, good.

23:28.720 --> 23:34.160
In middle school, dad told us that if you punch a bully

23:35.840 --> 23:39.680
just once really hard in the nose, like a shark,

23:40.400 --> 23:41.760
that that's usually enough.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.560
So I don't think you should do that.

23:44.560 --> 23:50.240
Because I think that's a that one's that that dog don't hunt.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.000
I think I would not suggest that.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.160
Oh, maybe when like she punches you,

23:54.160 --> 23:56.000
you give her a glass of punch

23:56.000 --> 23:57.920
and you pretend like you didn't understand

23:57.920 --> 23:59.120
the parameters of the game.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.320
Okay, that's fun.

24:00.320 --> 24:04.720
Except I'm worried if she's like a big punch fan,

24:04.720 --> 24:07.120
you are building up possibly what may be

24:07.680 --> 24:10.480
what may go down in APA history

24:10.480 --> 24:15.040
as the most unhealthy Pavlovian response.

24:15.040 --> 24:19.520
She may start seeing you as some sort of juice vending machine

24:19.520 --> 24:21.760
with one giant punchable button,

24:21.760 --> 24:24.640
which is like how Fonzie always punched

24:24.640 --> 24:27.360
that the jukebox to get music.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.520
Precisely, precisely.

24:30.560 --> 24:31.760
Don't punch people anymore.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.600
Don't just stop punching people.

24:34.720 --> 24:37.520
Hey, here's a relevant question.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.040
My name is Chris Brown.

24:39.040 --> 24:42.080
How do I get people to stop making Rihanna jokes?

24:42.080 --> 24:44.160
Concerned celebrity copycat in Chicago.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.360
Yeah, there's an easy answer.

24:47.360 --> 24:50.080
Yeah, get in a fucking cryo chamber and wait 30 years.

24:51.680 --> 24:54.000
Either of those fucking people are fake.

24:54.000 --> 24:54.640
You're in debt.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.400
Well, I was going to say that when they say,

24:56.400 --> 24:59.200
hey, you just like go out to me.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.240
Go, Shh, I'm trying to stay under the radar

25:02.960 --> 25:03.760
and then run away.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.120
I mean, I don't think you know who Chris Brown.

25:07.120 --> 25:07.760
I don't think you do.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.280
No, I do, so it's like you're pretending

25:09.280 --> 25:10.960
like you've had cosmetic surgery,

25:10.960 --> 25:12.560
but you refuse to change your name

25:12.560 --> 25:14.000
because you're really proud of your name.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.240
Chris Brown is like the worst person

25:16.240 --> 25:17.600
at being incognito ever.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.520
What if he changed his name

25:20.560 --> 25:22.080
and they were like, hey, Chris.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.360
And he's like, oh, I'm not Chris Brown anymore.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.960
I had to change my name because of all the Rihanna stuff.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.720
You can call me OJ Simpson from now on.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.040
Like, you changed your code, OJ Simpson?

25:29.920 --> 25:31.040
You're like, yeah, because I love this.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.080
I just picked it at random.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.400
I love the Simpsons and orange juice

25:34.400 --> 25:35.520
is like my favorite beverage.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.040
And so I just thought like, why not?

25:37.040 --> 25:38.080
You know, good on good.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.280
It's like chocolate and peanut butter.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.080
It's kind of not, though, like that.

25:42.880 --> 25:44.240
It's not in any way like that.

25:44.240 --> 25:55.120
Let's go to the Monday.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.520
I want to tell you guys about a new podcast

25:57.520 --> 26:00.560
that I am learning about

26:00.560 --> 26:03.440
called the Optimism Club podcast.

26:03.440 --> 26:06.480
Now, you guys know Steve and Andy, of course.

26:07.520 --> 26:11.040
And Steve Buscemi and Andy Buscemi.

26:11.040 --> 26:11.520
Circus.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.480
Steve and Andy Buscemi.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.920
Andy Buscemi is the failed clone of Steve Buscemi.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.080
He's the unattractive Buscemi brother.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.280
Which is really unfortunate

26:21.280 --> 26:22.720
because Steve Buscemi already looks like

26:22.720 --> 26:24.160
a failed clone of somebody else.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.840
He's a failed clone of Steve Goomba.

26:27.840 --> 26:30.800
It's a whole other one.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.200
They do a podcast that covers everything.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.240
You like comedy, video games, movies, comic books,

26:36.240 --> 26:39.120
comedy books, video comics.

26:39.120 --> 26:40.400
They got it all on there.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.760
And they talk about it every week.

26:42.480 --> 26:43.760
They've talked about Batman.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.040
They've talked about The Walking Dead.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.160
And the host's favorite podcast.

26:48.160 --> 26:51.280
Hopefully there's only one that comes up in that discussion.

26:52.240 --> 26:56.640
And there's an intro and outro by Bob Ball,

26:56.640 --> 26:58.240
just like our show.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.160
So that's trademark infringement.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.920
And I expect the check is in the mail.

27:03.920 --> 27:06.240
So go search for the Optimism Club podcast

27:06.240 --> 27:07.600
and listen to it, you fools.

27:07.600 --> 27:08.560
I like this.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.320
I will listen to this podcast.

27:10.320 --> 27:13.440
I'm sick of podcasts that just talk about

27:13.440 --> 27:15.040
how awful everything is.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.400
Because it's a wonderful world we live in.

27:19.040 --> 27:19.440
It is.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.600
I'm happy someone's finally acknowledging that.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.040
Speaking of a wonderful world,

27:25.040 --> 27:27.520
it's a great world we live in where you can buy

27:27.520 --> 27:31.360
all the dicks you could ever want or need

27:31.360 --> 27:34.400
on the internet in a discreet package

27:34.400 --> 27:37.280
on ExtremeRestraints.com.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.200
Fantastic, Griffin.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.960
Now, is this the same site where I can get

27:42.960 --> 27:44.640
some bedroom bondage?

27:44.640 --> 27:47.120
Like the under the bed restraint system?

27:47.120 --> 27:48.720
Which I was disappointed to find out

27:48.720 --> 27:50.640
was a restraint system that went under the bed

27:50.640 --> 27:52.880
and not something to lock someone

27:52.880 --> 27:54.160
hanging underneath your bed.

27:54.160 --> 27:57.760
Or some way to ensnare the monster.

27:58.640 --> 28:01.200
Some way to tie up that monster so you can fuck it.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.960
So you can fuck it real good.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.760
I'm gonna fuck that monster on your bed.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.560
That would be a good way to assuage your child's fears.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.360
There's someone under the bed.

28:09.360 --> 28:10.960
It's the boogie man, don't worry about this.

28:10.960 --> 28:11.520
Is there?

28:11.520 --> 28:12.080
Let me get out the-

28:12.080 --> 28:13.360
We'll be like 10 minutes alone in here.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.280
Let me get out the fucking, the trap.

28:15.280 --> 28:18.080
Let me get out the fucking proton pack.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.160
Zip zap.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.840
You can get 200 feet of bondage rope

28:21.840 --> 28:23.360
on this site for $55.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.400
Which seems like a steal.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.800
I just think 200 feet of rope would be awesome.

28:26.800 --> 28:34.320
Can I turn my office into the room

28:34.320 --> 28:36.560
of like some sort of safari hunter?

28:37.120 --> 28:39.520
But instead of having like a zebra head

28:39.520 --> 28:41.280
and a lion head perched on the wall,

28:41.280 --> 28:42.720
just like a bunch of dicks.

28:42.720 --> 28:43.760
And then people would be like,

28:43.760 --> 28:44.880
what are those dicks from?

28:44.880 --> 28:47.040
And I can say it's from the animals I've hunted.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.680
As a carpenter, the trick is you gotta find

28:50.240 --> 28:51.360
the studs in the wall.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.920
Or else all those dicks are just gonna fall off.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.840
Yeah, that would be miserable.

28:55.840 --> 28:56.560
Cause then people would be like,

28:56.560 --> 28:58.000
why are all your dicks on the floor?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.920
And I'll say, I'm so ashamed.

28:59.920 --> 29:00.720
It's a dirty room.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.160
But I know what you're thinking.

29:02.160 --> 29:07.280
How can I keep up, you know, that level of decoration

29:07.280 --> 29:08.560
and not go to the poor house?

29:08.560 --> 29:11.840
The good news is that if you use the coupon code swordfish-

29:11.840 --> 29:14.640
The longest running, hack this one.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.240
This is not a good password.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.480
It's unfortunate cause we picked something

29:18.480 --> 29:19.600
that was unhackable.

29:19.600 --> 29:23.200
I know, maybe we should start putting like zeros

29:23.200 --> 29:26.320
and do some fucking cryptography on this bitch.

29:26.320 --> 29:27.600
That's gonna get you a 20% off.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.520
And swordfish with like a one instead of an I.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.600
Ah fuck, I ruined it, I said it.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.160
That's gonna get you 20% off on the website

29:34.160 --> 29:37.360
so you can buy one fifth as many dicks.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.880
Do you guys know any wind talkers?

29:41.760 --> 29:43.280
We gotta do our next password

29:43.280 --> 29:50.240
in like a mix of like Navajo and binary.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.400
Extreme machines.com is the website.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.240
You can start that with an E or an X and it still works,

29:56.880 --> 29:57.600
which is nice.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.040
They got both of those locked down.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.960
They got everything, medical fetish, floggers and whips,

30:02.960 --> 30:09.200
and you can save it all 20% off with the coupon code swordfish.

30:09.200 --> 30:09.440
Thank you.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.520
They are truly wonderful people who have supported us

30:11.520 --> 30:13.040
for so stupid long.

30:13.040 --> 30:13.840
It's awesome.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.280
Huge supporters of the show,

30:15.280 --> 30:19.440
and we couldn't be happier to have them still supporting us.

30:19.440 --> 30:22.320
No one is more responsible for bringing this show

30:22.320 --> 30:23.200
to you every week,

30:23.840 --> 30:25.920
including the people on this call, the extremestrings.com.

30:25.920 --> 30:29.120
So make sure you go there and support their wonderful website.

30:32.320 --> 30:34.320
Hi, I'm homosexual Brian Stoppe.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.320
And I'm feminasty Erin Gibson,

30:36.320 --> 30:38.720
and we host Throwing Shade.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.920
Where we take a weekly look at all the issues important to ladies.

30:41.920 --> 30:42.480
And gays.

30:42.480 --> 30:45.360
And treat them with much less respect than they deserve.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.240
It's for gay people.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.360
It's for straight people.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.240
It's for ladies.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.960
It's for people who love to laugh, who love comedy,

30:50.960 --> 30:52.640
and love tragedy and love crime.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.360
And who hate drinking and driving because that's messed up.

30:55.360 --> 30:56.400
Don't text.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.520

31:03.680 --> 31:04.560
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

31:05.200 --> 31:05.760
I'd love one.

31:05.760 --> 31:06.880
This one was sent by Alan Black.

31:06.880 --> 31:07.680
Thanks Alan Black.

31:08.240 --> 31:08.880
It's by Yahoo.

31:08.880 --> 31:10.480
We haven't seen Alan Black in a while.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.840
Well, I mean, he does a lot of chops.

31:11.840 --> 31:13.840
If you guys haven't been on the forums lately,

31:13.840 --> 31:16.080
Alan Black is frequently dropping chops on there.

31:16.080 --> 31:16.720
Photo chops.

31:17.920 --> 31:18.320
They're all really good.

31:18.320 --> 31:19.920
Are those the forums at maximumfun.org?

31:19.920 --> 31:22.160
Yes, those are the one and the same.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.840
Yahoo was asked by Kingmaster1, who asks,

31:28.960 --> 31:30.400
Is there a cursed sword?

31:32.480 --> 31:35.520
I'm reposting this because no one helped me on the first one.

31:36.480 --> 31:40.560
Is there a place in Japan where I could buy a cursed sword?

31:40.560 --> 31:42.560
Real answers only, please no sarcasm.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.400
There is.

31:44.400 --> 31:44.880
There is.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.480
But you're going to have to fight your way there.

31:49.360 --> 31:51.840
And then it is not worth it because that curse,

31:52.480 --> 31:55.360
it just kind of makes you feel like you need to go to the bathroom all the time.

31:55.360 --> 31:56.880
But when you get there, nothing happens.

31:56.880 --> 32:00.000
So the curse is IBS because I've already got that particular...

32:01.280 --> 32:04.240
Every sword is cursed for me in this scenario.

32:04.240 --> 32:07.040
That's why I'm saying the cost benefit analysis is not very high.

32:07.040 --> 32:07.280
Okay.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.760
Unless you're the last dragon.

32:09.760 --> 32:10.320
Well, yes.

32:10.320 --> 32:12.080
Then you nullify it because you...

32:12.080 --> 32:12.320
Yeah.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.480
If you have the power of the glow, then I think that you can...

32:14.480 --> 32:14.720
Okay.

32:14.720 --> 32:17.360
Well, now we're getting into a whole other thing.

32:17.360 --> 32:22.240
You got to check your Venn diagram overlap of do you have IBS and the glow?

32:22.800 --> 32:24.560
Because they're basically one and the same.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.400
IBS is basically just the glow.

32:26.400 --> 32:29.040
I mean, as for as useful as it turns out to be.

32:29.040 --> 32:32.240
Listen, don't bring your medical science into this, Justin.

32:32.240 --> 32:32.560
All right.

32:34.400 --> 32:38.400
I bought a $12 set of chef mate knives at Target

32:38.400 --> 32:43.360
that lost their sharpness within minutes.

32:44.800 --> 32:49.120
So really, I think that I have like 10 cursed kitchen knives.

32:51.200 --> 32:56.320
The thing about a great as a curse sword is that anybody can curse a sword.

32:56.320 --> 32:56.480
Yeah.

32:56.480 --> 32:56.800
Right?

32:56.800 --> 32:57.360
Fuck you.

32:57.360 --> 32:58.560
Fuck this dagger.

32:58.560 --> 32:58.800
Right?

32:58.800 --> 32:59.760
Fuck this dagger.

33:01.120 --> 33:03.680
Fucking Wazaikishi, bitch.

33:05.360 --> 33:06.080
And then it's cursed.

33:06.080 --> 33:07.120
And then it's cursed forever.

33:07.120 --> 33:10.960
Is it a grab bag thing or can you pick what the curse does?

33:10.960 --> 33:14.080
Or is it just like when you curse, it's just like, oh, sorry, it's a little heavier.

33:14.080 --> 33:15.120
No, they're all IBS.

33:17.600 --> 33:18.720
It's across the board IBS.

33:20.800 --> 33:24.000
You could curse it yourself for the next person to buy it

33:24.000 --> 33:27.760
and just put some jelly on the handle.

33:27.760 --> 33:30.160
Oh, the worst curse.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.680
That's a terrible curse.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.920
I love that that's your go-to curse, Justin.

33:33.920 --> 33:38.240
You're at the Comic-Con and I mean, if you're buying a sword at the Comic-Con,

33:38.240 --> 33:44.480
it's going to have some sort of moisture on it that's going to be unpleasant to the touch.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.840
Some brand of condensation.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.720
It will have condensed out of the con air.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.120
Not out of the movie.

33:51.120 --> 33:54.240
I mean, specifically out of the air in the convention center.

33:55.360 --> 34:00.480
I have bought, I don't think I've ever bought a sword at a Comic-Con.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.080
I have bought two kendo sticks.

34:02.080 --> 34:02.640
Perfect.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.800
Let's air out our dirty laundry right now because I feel-

34:06.800 --> 34:09.760
I've bought at least four different phasers at Comic-Con.

34:09.760 --> 34:10.320
That's true.

34:10.320 --> 34:13.920
I have bought countless knives, most of them throwing knives.

34:13.920 --> 34:17.920
Man, this is some shit that I bet people would not have guessed about us or they probably,

34:17.920 --> 34:18.560
or they did.

34:18.560 --> 34:19.520
Probably, absolutely.

34:19.520 --> 34:23.520
There is something about, yeah, because I think the first knife I ever bought

34:23.520 --> 34:28.800
was like a decorative dragon handle and I bought it at the hunting and fishing show in Huntington.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.320
That's right, that's right.

34:30.320 --> 34:35.520
That's right, nobody's going to fucking skin a deer with this Game of Thrones

34:36.560 --> 34:40.800
Valerian steel blade that you bought at the Huntington Hunting and Fishing Show.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.920
There is something where it's like every day if someone says to me,

34:43.920 --> 34:45.120
hey, do you want a grappling hook?

34:45.120 --> 34:46.880
I'm like, well, no, I'd never use that.

34:46.880 --> 34:50.400
When I'm at, but when I'm at a convention, I see that grappling hook

34:50.400 --> 34:54.320
and I just kind of run my fingers across and go, yeah, I could totally see it.

34:54.320 --> 34:57.280
I love to envision this at the Hunting and Fishing Show.

34:57.280 --> 35:00.560
Travis, in the corner of the hall,

35:01.120 --> 35:05.120
Travis finds a dark canvas tent scribed in rooms.

35:05.120 --> 35:08.000
Welcome to the Tent of History, come in, wanderer.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.880
It's made of dragon bone and purest mithril.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.000
Also, do you want some jerky?

35:17.840 --> 35:20.960
I think one of my favorite, this is one of the sales pitches,

35:20.960 --> 35:26.000
I was once given at like 14, it was this triangle shaped black metal blade

35:26.000 --> 35:30.960
and the dude goes, yeah, that totally won't show up in the metal detectors.

35:32.400 --> 35:35.360
Cool thing to say to a kid, to a child.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.800
But I mean, that's for like fighting terrorists on the plane.

35:40.800 --> 35:43.280
Not for doing the terrorism, but like if there is a terrorist,

35:43.280 --> 35:44.320
you know how to deal with it.

35:44.320 --> 35:47.600
Oh no, yeah, it's an American made stealth blade, so.

35:47.600 --> 35:55.920
I bought kendo sticks because, A, I liked the idea of there being a sport associated with it.

35:56.960 --> 36:02.000
Not a sport that I would say was particularly big in West Virginia.

36:02.800 --> 36:07.440
There wasn't a particularly large kendo community, not a lot of sparring partners,

36:07.440 --> 36:14.400
not many dojos in general, as a rule, but I also liked the non-lethal option.

36:14.400 --> 36:17.920
You know what I mean? Because what if I was in the parking lot of Mid-Ohio Con

36:18.480 --> 36:21.440
and a couple of iron men came up and started some shit?

36:21.440 --> 36:25.120
I don't want to kill them with it, with Travis's dragon blade.

36:25.120 --> 36:26.560
You know what I mean? I just want to incapacitate-

36:26.560 --> 36:28.480
I still own that dragon blade, by the way, it's real wicked.

36:28.480 --> 36:28.960
I know you do.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.080
I'll post a picture.

36:30.080 --> 36:36.480
I have disavowed myself of all kendo sticks, of all katanadakas.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.960
Wherever this ended up, just over the years.

36:38.960 --> 36:41.520
Dumpsters, and I gave one to Evan Minsker, so.

36:41.520 --> 36:46.160
The dumpster outside of Evan Minsker's house. Let's be real.

36:46.160 --> 36:49.600
I give them away as gifts, like at weddings and stuff like that.

36:49.600 --> 36:56.960
Before we move on to the next question, I wanted to take you guys on a little journey

36:56.960 --> 36:58.480
that I went on just now.

36:59.200 --> 37:04.400
I was going to give you guys some Wikipedia information about the hit film, The Last Dragon,

37:05.120 --> 37:11.280
but the only thing we're sharing on here is I want to read you a little bit of the book.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.440
I want to read you one paragraph.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.080
There are four paragraphs about the production of this film.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.520
Don't read all four.

37:17.520 --> 37:18.720
I'm not going to.

37:18.720 --> 37:22.480
There's one about Bill Macy being in there because, you know, that's crazy.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.120
Here is the last paragraph in this section.

37:26.480 --> 37:31.120
Julius J. Carey III, in the role of Shonuff, trained in martial arts for the film,

37:31.120 --> 37:34.960
appeared in numerous television roles like Dr. Abraham Butterfield on Dr. Doctor,

37:34.960 --> 37:39.920
and most notably, the bounty hunter Lord Bowler in The Avengers of Briscoe County Jr.

37:39.920 --> 37:43.760
He was a supporting actor in the R. Ray Moore film, Disco Godfather,

37:43.760 --> 37:48.240
and also appeared in The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh and on shows such as Murphy Brown,

37:48.240 --> 37:52.480
Family Matters, A Different World, Two Guys and a Girl at a Pizza Place, and Boy Meets World.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.160
He enjoyed playing basketball.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.960
Carey died August 19, 2008, of pancreatic cancer.

37:58.320 --> 37:59.120
That's the...

37:59.120 --> 38:03.520
He was on Boy Meets World, he enjoyed playing basketball,

38:04.720 --> 38:07.040
and then he died of pancreatic cancer in 2008.

38:07.040 --> 38:07.840
That's the...

38:07.840 --> 38:09.760
Listen, not to bring it down, you guys.

38:09.760 --> 38:15.680
Listen, I should have ended, in retrospect, I should have ended on the basketball.

38:15.680 --> 38:19.360
Well, but then the past tense of enjoyed would have left me hanging, like,

38:19.360 --> 38:21.440
where's he at? Where did his soul end up?

38:21.440 --> 38:23.520
Did he stop playing basketball? Does he not enjoy it anymore?

38:23.520 --> 38:25.920
I was under the impression that he had the fucking glow,

38:26.560 --> 38:30.720
and that he would be an earthwalker for the rest of his days, but apparently not.

38:30.720 --> 38:31.600
Apparently not.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.800
On Boy Meets World, he played Angela's dad, in case anyone was wondering.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.160
And I was.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.040
He also had the glow.

38:38.000 --> 38:38.560
He also had the glow and that.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.040
There's a very, very strange subplot on...

38:42.000 --> 38:46.320
And two guys, a girl and a pizza place, I believe he was the chef at the pizza place.

38:47.440 --> 38:48.400
And he had the glow and that.

38:49.680 --> 38:50.560
Everybody has the glow.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.520
How about another real question?

38:54.400 --> 38:56.160
A girl who thought I...

38:56.160 --> 38:59.440
Oh God, I'm sorry, my reading is just gonna keep getting worse.

39:00.240 --> 39:01.680
A girl who I was...

39:02.320 --> 39:04.160
Okay, this isn't my fault.

39:04.160 --> 39:05.680
A girl who I was...

39:05.680 --> 39:07.200
I think it's a girl who I thought...

39:07.200 --> 39:12.800
Okay, a girl who I thought could be a potential jeef recently propositioned me,

39:12.800 --> 39:15.040
the old friends with benefits.

39:15.600 --> 39:20.080
This is a first to me, but I happily accepted, as I am moving soon, and no roots would be planted.

39:20.880 --> 39:25.040
The catch is, in our first encounter, I was enlightened to the fact that she is a masochist.

39:25.040 --> 39:26.720
This too is a first for me.

39:26.720 --> 39:32.000
After a night of exploring, she told me that I do not have the personality to be her dom,

39:32.000 --> 39:33.600
and said I could be her sub.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.840
Oh, you fucked up the job interview.

39:35.840 --> 39:39.520
You blew the where do you see yourself in five years question.

39:39.520 --> 39:43.840
That's like, yeah, we can't make you the general manager of this branch,

39:43.840 --> 39:47.840
but we will fuck your butt with a broomstick.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.360
Is that cool?

39:49.360 --> 39:53.760
Don't use a broomstick, use one of the many delightful adult toys at extremistranks.com.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.200
You're right, but those might not hurt enough.

39:55.200 --> 39:55.920
Anyway, go ahead.

39:56.640 --> 40:02.160
Brothers, is this endeavor worth exploring if not only to further my experience,

40:02.160 --> 40:08.240
or am I swimming in a sea of sexy that is over my head, that's from BDSM, in Brunswick?

40:09.280 --> 40:11.520
I mean, it's gotta be pretty fucking sexy,

40:11.520 --> 40:14.240
because there's like a shitload of people who are into that.

40:15.040 --> 40:19.840
Yeah, I mean, people, obviously, they're making enough money at the place they sell things to do

40:19.840 --> 40:21.680
that they can keep this dumb show running.

40:21.680 --> 40:22.180
True.

40:22.560 --> 40:30.320
Our show is, we are basically the sub to the relationship between us and Extreme Restraints.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.320
They are the Dom.

40:32.320 --> 40:35.920
You are only gonna, I mean, this is a great sort of intro point.

40:35.920 --> 40:38.240
I think you gotta start as a sub and work your way up to a Dom.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.080
Oh, yeah, it's like you can't be a Dom.

40:40.080 --> 40:43.920
Oh, you gotta get the resume credits, you gotta put in 10,000 hours, as Malcolm Gladwell would say.

40:43.920 --> 40:44.420
Yeah.

40:44.420 --> 40:47.440
You can't be an expert at BDSM just when you start.

40:47.440 --> 40:50.960
After 10,000 hours, you would be a fucking hand puppet, man.

40:50.960 --> 40:54.160
You're gonna be limber, you're gonna be just empty.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.080
Just empty, hollowed out.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.360
Where's my pancreas?

40:57.360 --> 40:59.120
I had a pancreas when I came in here.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.480
Your master has claimed it.

41:00.480 --> 41:01.040
All right.

41:01.040 --> 41:07.120
I mean, being a sub is not all about getting your butt slammed.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.800
No, but I think that if you didn't know the, here's what I'm suggesting.

41:10.800 --> 41:17.280
If you don't know the sort of culture of BDSM, it seems like there would have to be a learning experience.

41:17.280 --> 41:21.520
And if your tutor is the person who's your sub, it seems like it would kind of ruin the fantasy

41:21.520 --> 41:25.040
if they constantly had to be like, no, no, no, just five inches deeper.

41:25.040 --> 41:27.200
I'm cavernous down there.

41:27.200 --> 41:33.760
So yeah, I think as long as she knows that like you're new to this and everything, yeah.

41:33.760 --> 41:37.760
Is there an apprenticeship that he can take on somewhere, like a blacksmith?

41:37.760 --> 41:41.040
Correspondence course, University of Phoenix.

41:41.040 --> 41:44.000
It sounds like that's what she's offering him.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.760
I mean, right?

41:45.760 --> 41:53.440
It seems like if he doesn't have the personality to be your Dom, she's willing to take on, you know, this young butt.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.760
What if, what if this is all he can do?

41:55.760 --> 42:00.320
What if, what if this is all a huge misunderstanding, and the next time.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.080
No, I said I want to make you a sound.

42:02.080 --> 42:09.920
And the next time that they show up in the bedroom, he's wearing his, you know, his pain shorts,

42:09.920 --> 42:14.960
and he's already strapped himself in to the to the bad boy chair.

42:14.960 --> 42:24.240
And then she walks into the room and she is wearing a very convincing Dom Deluise fat suit.

42:24.240 --> 42:27.200
And he has to dress, that is the hottest sex play.

42:27.200 --> 42:31.440
One person dressed like Dom Deluise, the other person dressed like a submarine sandwich.

42:31.440 --> 42:34.000
And he's like a squirt of it.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.280
Dom Deluise just goes fucking crazy on it.

42:37.280 --> 42:42.960
They had to fucking tint the windows of his trailer because of what he did to a subway sandwich.

42:42.960 --> 42:45.680
I'm gonna eat all the pepperoncinis first.

42:45.680 --> 42:50.160
Put them on my nipples and bend my neck down and eat them right off.

42:50.160 --> 42:57.760
Now, at what point does it stop being like a play thing and start being like a tribute?

42:57.760 --> 43:01.680
I do a historically accurate Dom Deluise.

43:01.680 --> 43:04.240
It's a two man show.

43:04.240 --> 43:06.880
The other man doesn't have a lot of lines.

43:06.880 --> 43:10.240
I think it's, I think you have to change it to DDSM.

43:10.240 --> 43:15.600
Because the Dom, for as a tribute to our friend Dom.

43:15.600 --> 43:20.080
Dom destroys sandwich meats.

43:20.080 --> 43:24.880
I, you know what, fucking go for it.

43:24.880 --> 43:29.960
You only go around once and you should live like you're dying and just see what this experience

43:29.960 --> 43:30.960
is like.

43:30.960 --> 43:31.960
Maybe you dig it.

43:31.960 --> 43:36.160
You're only gonna find out if you, I think if you don't enjoy it, obviously, you know,

43:36.160 --> 43:40.120
it's not something you should push yourself into.

43:40.120 --> 43:42.640
But I mean, what the hell?

43:42.640 --> 43:43.640
Give it a shot.

43:43.640 --> 43:46.000
It's the kind of thing you set up a safe word and stuff, right?

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Yeah.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
So.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Duck tales?

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Yeah.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Oh, man.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Do you guys want another Yahoo?

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
Yeah, sure.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.440
This one was sent in by iRuRae.

43:57.440 --> 43:59.920
Are you iRuRae?

43:59.920 --> 44:00.920
Who wants to know?

44:00.920 --> 44:01.920
Sorry, too much of a pause.

44:01.920 --> 44:02.920
I didn't know.

44:02.920 --> 44:03.920
Wanged it.

44:03.920 --> 44:04.920
It's been a while.

44:04.920 --> 44:05.920
You wanged it.

44:05.920 --> 44:06.920
Thank you, iRuRae.

44:06.920 --> 44:15.840
It's by Yahoo Answers user sk8rboi854856 who asks, how can I make my punches more explosive?

44:15.840 --> 44:18.080
What can I do to make my punches more explosive?

44:18.080 --> 44:19.200
The way I see it, I can.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.560
Buy a heavy shot put.

44:20.560 --> 44:21.780
Buy a heavy medicine ball.

44:21.780 --> 44:24.780
Do clap push-ups.

44:24.780 --> 44:25.780
Those are hard.

44:25.780 --> 44:26.780
I bet.

44:26.780 --> 44:27.780
I've never accomplished one myself.

44:27.780 --> 44:33.120
Does he want his punches to be more powerful or like he wants to punch things and then

44:33.120 --> 44:34.120
just...

44:34.120 --> 44:36.640
I think explosive is kind of a catch-all.

44:36.640 --> 44:40.800
I think he just wants his punches to be better in general.

44:40.800 --> 44:41.800
Overall better punches.

44:41.800 --> 44:46.520
You know, Bruce Lee had a philosophy where he just saw his power like water because you

44:46.520 --> 44:48.880
pour water into a cup and it takes the shape of a cup.

44:48.880 --> 44:51.280
Or you pour water into a bowl and it takes the shape of a bowl.

44:51.280 --> 44:56.020
So he would take all of his water and put it into his fist and punch like that.

44:56.020 --> 44:59.800
He called it a wet punch and people would be like, oh, what the, oh man, now I'm wet.

44:59.800 --> 45:00.800
Oh man.

45:00.800 --> 45:01.800
Yeah.

45:01.800 --> 45:06.040
And they would be so discombobulated by the dampness that they would not know how to retaliate.

45:06.040 --> 45:07.760
What if you put jelly on his fist?

45:07.760 --> 45:09.280
What would be more unpleasant?

45:09.280 --> 45:16.500
Justin, I'm worried that a lot of your solutions to a lot of your problems are put some preserves

45:16.500 --> 45:18.360
on it.

45:18.360 --> 45:20.160
Are you being paid by Big Jelly?

45:20.160 --> 45:21.840
It's just so unpleasant.

45:21.840 --> 45:24.960
This isn't even the first episode where you suggested you get back at it.

45:24.960 --> 45:28.260
Like a good prank would be to put jelly on somebody's door handle.

45:28.260 --> 45:32.520
Like you are like, you are like Jelly Batman.

45:32.520 --> 45:35.320
I prefer the sticky bandit, but thank you.

45:35.320 --> 45:37.160
Why is my fucking door handle jelly?

45:37.160 --> 45:38.160
Pray to me.

45:38.160 --> 45:41.160
What are you doing?

45:41.160 --> 45:42.480
Stop.

45:42.480 --> 45:46.760
You're wearing a belt that is just covered in smuckers and you just scooped some smuckers

45:46.760 --> 45:49.280
off your belt.

45:49.280 --> 45:50.280
Why so sticky?

45:50.280 --> 45:55.360
See, it wasn't even Batman as the Joker.

45:55.360 --> 46:00.200
He's also the sticky Joker.

46:00.200 --> 46:03.320
Can you, I'm not wearing something sticky.

46:03.320 --> 46:04.600
Is that better?

46:04.600 --> 46:07.300
That's way better.

46:07.300 --> 46:13.640
I mean, you hold, you can hold so many things to augment your punches.

46:13.640 --> 46:15.280
Oh, that's true.

46:15.280 --> 46:16.280
Roll of quarters.

46:16.280 --> 46:17.280
That's supposed to be good.

46:17.280 --> 46:21.120
Roll of quarters, dildo from Extreme Restraints.

46:21.120 --> 46:22.440
Nice dildo punch.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.880
No one's coming back from that for a lot of reasons.

46:24.880 --> 46:28.860
You can put a lot of those, you know those little snap things you buy at firework places

46:28.860 --> 46:32.200
you throw on the ground and then they pop.

46:32.200 --> 46:35.560
Get a big fistful of those and punch someone with it.

46:35.560 --> 46:38.880
Don't just like cover your hand in hairspray and light it on fire and then punch them.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.400
Oh shit, that's good.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.480
Can you tie- That'd be fucking terrifying.

46:42.480 --> 46:46.540
Tie your fist to the hood of a car and have them just go.

46:46.540 --> 46:49.140
Have your friends pick you up and launch you at them.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.400
That's a good one.

46:50.400 --> 46:55.000
Can you use- Can you stand on the hood of a car, have your friends drive at someone

46:55.000 --> 47:00.120
really fast and then stop short and you just fucking fly forward and give them that huge

47:00.120 --> 47:01.780
inertia punch.

47:01.780 --> 47:02.780
I like that.

47:02.780 --> 47:06.000
Walk upside down from the ceiling with your fist extended and when they walk in the room

47:06.000 --> 47:09.520
have a friend cut the cord and then you just drop on them with your punch.

47:09.520 --> 47:13.400
Then you got that extra gravity in there too, that's huge.

47:13.400 --> 47:15.880
What if you had those big hands- Get on the bottom of a piano and have them

47:15.880 --> 47:16.880
drop the piano.

47:16.880 --> 47:18.080
A lot of mine have to do with dropping.

47:18.080 --> 47:24.000
What if you have those big hands they had in the Foo Fighters video?

47:24.000 --> 47:25.540
That would probably be good.

47:25.540 --> 47:28.120
Just get Dave Grohl to push you into someone.

47:28.120 --> 47:29.120
Yeah.

47:29.120 --> 47:31.600
What if you wore a Hulk hand?

47:31.600 --> 47:37.120
That would depreciate the- But inside the Hulk hands, lead.

47:37.120 --> 47:41.160
That would still- I still think the softness of the hands would-

47:41.160 --> 47:42.160
Outside the Hulk hands?

47:42.160 --> 47:44.560
Okay, inside the Hulk hands, SARS.

47:44.560 --> 47:52.560
So you punch someone, the sponge contracts and expands, pushing the SARS outwards into

47:52.560 --> 47:53.560
the person's face.

47:53.560 --> 47:54.560
Correct.

47:54.560 --> 47:55.560
That's correct.

47:55.560 --> 47:56.560
And they're like, oh that didn't hurt and you go, haha.

47:56.560 --> 47:57.560
Didn't it?

47:57.560 --> 47:58.560
See you soon.

47:58.560 --> 47:59.560
See you soon.

47:59.560 --> 48:00.560
Because you're the angel of death.

48:00.560 --> 48:01.560
Come back to hell.

48:01.560 --> 48:04.840
I also don't know how SARS works.

48:04.840 --> 48:07.880
Oh God.

48:07.880 --> 48:11.000
I'm a doctor who specializes in SARS and this is how I get my business.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.320
I haven't had a lot of business lately.

48:12.320 --> 48:13.320
See you real soon.

48:13.320 --> 48:17.440
Stupid post office security checks.

48:17.440 --> 48:19.680
Just rotate your hips, I guess.

48:19.680 --> 48:20.680
Also that works.

48:20.680 --> 48:23.160
I mean that is what they tell you, I think.

48:23.160 --> 48:24.160
Really?

48:24.160 --> 48:25.160
Does that work?

48:25.160 --> 48:30.280
You put your feet- You spread your feet as far apart as you can possibly make them go.

48:30.280 --> 48:35.440
If you can do a perfect split, then that's great, because that's the kind of leverage

48:35.440 --> 48:36.440
you need.

48:36.440 --> 48:40.320
Because the important thing to remember is the power doesn't come from your bicep, it

48:40.320 --> 48:41.320
comes from your knees.

48:41.320 --> 48:46.280
And you make the loosest fist you can with your hand, because a loose fist punch hurts

48:46.280 --> 48:48.440
way more than a tight fist punch.

48:48.440 --> 48:49.800
And you can hold more jelly that way.

48:49.800 --> 48:51.400
And you can hold a lot more jelly.

48:51.400 --> 48:52.400
That's right, Travis.

48:52.400 --> 48:55.640
A closed fist holds no jelly, as the old proverb says.

48:55.640 --> 48:58.080
Bruce Lee said that.

48:58.080 --> 49:00.960
Then you just give him the old- Slap him.

49:00.960 --> 49:01.960
Give him the old Bronx handshake.

49:01.960 --> 49:02.960
You know what I mean?

49:02.960 --> 49:03.960
Did you just admit that?

49:03.960 --> 49:08.760
Did you just admit the Bronx handshake?

49:08.760 --> 49:13.540
You know, I had a girl give me a Bronx handshake and a sticky joker once, and I broke up with

49:13.540 --> 49:14.540
her shortly.

49:14.540 --> 49:16.320
I know, I was like, baby, please don't punch.

49:16.320 --> 49:18.760
No punching.

49:18.760 --> 49:22.960
What if this is written by that guy's girlfriend?

49:22.960 --> 49:29.600
My guy, if there's one thing I know about my boo, he loves punches in his tummy.

49:29.600 --> 49:33.920
How can I give him that punch juice he so desperately craves?

49:33.920 --> 49:37.400
A couple days ago, I was texting with a male friend when he suddenly brought up his sexual

49:37.400 --> 49:38.440
preferences.

49:38.440 --> 49:42.920
He was quite specific in detailing what he liked to do to women in bed, when before,

49:42.920 --> 49:47.240
we had hardly grazed any sexual topic before in any conversation.

49:47.240 --> 49:52.200
He was quick to add that he was kinky and asked a few questions about what I liked,

49:52.200 --> 49:55.440
like, barf-a-rama.

49:55.440 --> 50:01.160
This may be incredibly obtuse, but even to their female friends, guys don't just bring

50:01.160 --> 50:03.940
up this for the sake of idle chatter, right?

50:03.940 --> 50:04.940
Like ever?

50:04.940 --> 50:08.800
I mean, he wants to go straight to pound town, right?

50:08.800 --> 50:10.860
Am I missing something here?

50:10.860 --> 50:14.600
That's from Textual Sexual Surprised Indianapolis.

50:14.600 --> 50:15.600
It's pretty good.

50:15.600 --> 50:16.600
Hey, hey, buddy.

50:16.600 --> 50:17.600
Hey, pal.

50:17.600 --> 50:18.600
I'm into pee.

50:18.600 --> 50:23.680
Hey, hey, old chum.

50:23.680 --> 50:24.680
You know what I like?

50:24.680 --> 50:25.680
Armpits.

50:25.680 --> 50:31.200
Is it, okay, first caveat.

50:31.200 --> 50:35.480
You can't ignore the possibility that your friend left the room and his asshole friend

50:35.480 --> 50:40.560
picked up the phone and started texting you about Cleveland stainless and stuff.

50:40.560 --> 50:41.560
That's good.

50:41.560 --> 50:42.560
I like that.

50:42.560 --> 50:51.360
We obviously, just a few sort of like super clear caveats here, we embrace any whatever

50:51.360 --> 50:52.360
you want.

50:52.360 --> 50:53.880
Not pee play, though.

50:53.880 --> 50:57.520
I'm sorry, the line must be drawn here.

50:57.520 --> 51:05.600
Anything is fine, but like don't change the tenor of your, I mean, you can't just change

51:05.600 --> 51:09.920
your heading, your course heading in a text.

51:09.920 --> 51:10.920
It doesn't work that way.

51:10.920 --> 51:14.520
You can't just decide to change this whole direction.

51:14.520 --> 51:15.520
It's a very uncomfortable situation.

51:15.520 --> 51:18.040
Leave a voicemail at the very least.

51:18.040 --> 51:19.040
Something, right?

51:19.040 --> 51:23.600
If you're gonna drop some kink, if you're gonna drop a kink bomb on a...

51:23.600 --> 51:24.600
Do it on a YouTube.

51:24.600 --> 51:27.600
On an acquaintance, upload to YouTube.

51:27.600 --> 51:28.600
Make it private.

51:28.600 --> 51:29.600
Please.

51:29.600 --> 51:30.600
Please.

51:30.600 --> 51:31.960
Send it to a bud.

51:31.960 --> 51:35.800
Have some decorum.

51:35.800 --> 51:39.720
This is perhaps the grossest.

51:39.720 --> 51:41.720
What is offending you about this?

51:41.720 --> 51:48.480
Just the fact that like there's no, these people are complete platonic friends, right?

51:48.480 --> 51:52.960
This is what they made it sound like.

51:52.960 --> 51:58.840
He has skipped, even if they didn't wanna, even if he didn't like, even if they were

51:58.840 --> 52:06.320
not destined to date, even if they were gonna go like straight friends and binnies, he has

52:06.320 --> 52:15.560
skipped every fucking step between, hey pal, how's it going, do you wanna join my kickball

52:15.560 --> 52:18.200
league, and let me pee in your hair.

52:18.200 --> 52:20.680
At what time of day did this occur?

52:20.680 --> 52:27.620
Because if it was like two o'clock in the morning, he might have been drunk.

52:27.620 --> 52:32.840
Not that I think that makes that better or makes it okay, but I'm just saying like maybe

52:32.840 --> 52:37.920
that was his games, like oh, I was just drunk, but he was testing the waters, and with the

52:37.920 --> 52:44.280
excuse of saying he was drunk later, which is a dick move, ah god, see the problem with

52:44.280 --> 52:45.580
this is you can't go back.

52:45.580 --> 52:49.800
You can't, because either your friend wants to pee in your hair or he's a total fucking

52:49.800 --> 52:51.260
weird beard.

52:51.260 --> 52:56.920
I mean, maybe it can be both, but like either he just thinks that a cool thing to do with

52:56.920 --> 53:05.240
the friends that he's not especially close to is to text about his armpit play.

53:05.240 --> 53:09.520
And the weirdness is not this thing, I mean, to be clear, I feel like you guys aren't being

53:09.520 --> 53:10.520
clear enough about this.

53:10.520 --> 53:14.800
I'm not saying it's weird to be into pee or armpits, like nothing is weird, everything

53:14.800 --> 53:15.800
is accepted.

53:15.800 --> 53:22.280
No, no, no, I'm saying that the weird thing is the non sequitur shift to be like, hey,

53:22.280 --> 53:24.280
do you wanna go see Greg Gatsby this weekend?

53:24.280 --> 53:29.920
Oh, also, I really like it when people dress me up like Little Bo Peep.

53:29.920 --> 53:37.440
It's like, oh, I do wanna see Greg Gatsby, but now not with you.

53:37.440 --> 53:41.040
Why would you wanna see fucking Greg Gatsby anyway?

53:41.040 --> 53:44.520
I wanna see it more when I saw a Photoshop of Greg Gatsby, but that's just-

53:44.520 --> 53:47.000
I would see that movie!

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
I know!

53:48.000 --> 53:53.280
But yeah, that's the thing is it's not about what the dude's into, because fuck it, but

53:53.280 --> 53:57.320
like, hey man, don't put people on the spot.

53:57.320 --> 53:58.320
Don't put people on blast.

53:58.320 --> 54:03.400
I think that you are within your rights to either confront this dude and be like, hey

54:03.400 --> 54:08.040
man, that's not cool, you know, like, hey, for a lot of reasons, but like, where'd that

54:08.040 --> 54:09.040
come from?

54:09.040 --> 54:10.040
Unless.

54:10.040 --> 54:11.040
Unless.

54:11.040 --> 54:15.920
We're always telling people to live like they were dying.

54:15.920 --> 54:18.800
What if we accidentally gave this guy the advice to do this thing?

54:18.800 --> 54:25.160
Like, I've got this girl that I really, really like, so far all of our communique has been

54:25.160 --> 54:27.120
totally platonic.

54:27.120 --> 54:31.440
How do I set things off and get weird with her and her armpits as I am wont to do?

54:31.440 --> 54:35.320
Okay, so let's look at this from a future advice kind of thing.

54:35.320 --> 54:40.640
If anybody listening here wants to tell some random person about all of their stuff, please,

54:40.640 --> 54:45.360
please, please start it off with, hey, I'd like to tell you something kind of personal

54:45.360 --> 54:50.680
or I have something, not like just random chatting about like, hey, what are you going

54:50.680 --> 54:52.160
to do for dinner?

54:52.160 --> 54:59.840
Doesn't that sort of erode the sexual topsoil of their, the geography of their friendship

54:59.840 --> 55:00.840
though?

55:00.840 --> 55:06.240
Like, doesn't that kind of, if you want to explain your kinkiness to somebody, doesn't

55:06.240 --> 55:11.240
it kind of negate that to be like, hey, heads up, things are about to get pretty crazy in

55:11.240 --> 55:12.240
here.

55:12.240 --> 55:13.240
Brace your face.

55:13.240 --> 55:16.280
Your SMS message is about to get naughty.

55:16.280 --> 55:20.240
Is the problem with this that the friend is assuming his sexual preference?

55:20.240 --> 55:25.480
Because I feel like if this is a platonic male and female, that there wouldn't be the

55:25.480 --> 55:32.040
same, you know, it wouldn't have some of the same attachments, right?

55:32.040 --> 55:36.000
I don't understand because it's a male friend who says what he likes to do to women in bed.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.280
Yeah, she is, she is a girl.

55:38.280 --> 55:39.360
I'm almost certain.

55:39.360 --> 55:40.480
She is a woman.

55:40.480 --> 55:42.800
I know for a fact because I put the question.

55:42.800 --> 55:43.800
Okay.

55:43.800 --> 55:44.800
Well, all right.

55:44.800 --> 55:45.800
Okay.

55:45.800 --> 55:49.680
So here's, I like, here's, I, we are missing the bigger question.

55:49.680 --> 55:50.680
What which is?

55:50.680 --> 55:57.800
The bigger question is she is asking with him bringing this up, is he just like randomly

55:57.800 --> 56:02.440
telling me as a friend all the weird stuff he's into or does he want to go to the bone

56:02.440 --> 56:03.440
zone?

56:03.440 --> 56:04.440
Oh no, dear.

56:04.440 --> 56:05.440
Oh no.

56:05.440 --> 56:06.440
Madam.

56:06.440 --> 56:07.440
Madam.

56:07.440 --> 56:08.440
No.

56:08.440 --> 56:09.440
Magnumus.

56:09.440 --> 56:10.440
This is an easy one.

56:10.440 --> 56:11.440
Thank you, Travis.

56:11.440 --> 56:13.460
Let me put this into stark belief.

56:13.460 --> 56:16.360
He's definitely trying to have sex with you.

56:16.360 --> 56:18.460
There's not like, this is not, this is not.

56:18.460 --> 56:19.460
And let us also be.

56:19.460 --> 56:21.160
Let me check my advocates real quick.

56:21.160 --> 56:22.760
Click, click, click, click, click, click.

56:22.760 --> 56:23.760
Yes.

56:23.760 --> 56:25.120
Let us also be clear.

56:25.120 --> 56:30.640
If this question were about, I have a friend who likes salt water taffy, but I like sweet

56:30.640 --> 56:32.120
water taffy.

56:32.120 --> 56:36.200
Our response would be, he wants to have sex with you.

56:36.200 --> 56:41.040
There is, yeah, I mean, yes, that's correct.

56:41.040 --> 56:42.040
You are right.

56:42.040 --> 56:47.160
He has gone about, okay, see, now your guys' response, if she's a woman, that makes so

56:47.160 --> 56:52.480
much more sense why you guys are, I mean, that's very, that's, that's very presumptuous

56:52.480 --> 56:53.480
of him.

56:53.480 --> 56:58.720
It would be presumptuous either way, but that is very presumptuous of him to start sending.

56:58.720 --> 56:59.720
Right.

56:59.720 --> 57:00.720
That's.

57:00.720 --> 57:01.720
Yeah.

57:01.720 --> 57:03.760
Don't do that.

57:03.760 --> 57:04.760
Yeah.

57:04.760 --> 57:12.260
So I, I would say he definitely wants to have sex with you and it seems like even if you,

57:12.260 --> 57:18.420
even if your preferences a hundred percent synced up with his, his assumption that you

57:18.420 --> 57:23.780
would based on no prior discussion tells me that he's not a dude you want to continue

57:23.780 --> 57:25.040
to associate with.

57:25.040 --> 57:27.000
But what if she's into that?

57:27.000 --> 57:32.240
Like it sounds like we wouldn't be asking us the question, but we're just assuming that

57:32.240 --> 57:37.320
this guy is a total mustachioed weirdo.

57:37.320 --> 57:42.440
But what if he's just like a fucking like Gordon Gekko, like, let me cut to the chase.

57:42.440 --> 57:43.440
P boom.

57:43.440 --> 57:44.440
Bada boop.

57:44.440 --> 57:45.440
Bada beep.

57:45.440 --> 57:46.440
Bada boop.

57:46.440 --> 57:47.440
I like P. I like P, are you in?

57:47.440 --> 57:48.440
Yow.

57:48.440 --> 57:49.440
Zip zap.

57:49.440 --> 57:50.440
Bada boop.

57:50.440 --> 57:51.440
Gross.

57:51.440 --> 57:52.440
Gross is good.

57:52.440 --> 57:53.440
Gross.

57:53.440 --> 57:55.880
I'm going to cut to the chase.

57:55.880 --> 57:56.880
No fluff.

57:56.880 --> 57:58.680
No bullshit.

57:58.680 --> 58:00.480
My P, your hair tonight.

58:00.480 --> 58:01.480
Bada boop.

58:01.480 --> 58:05.800
All that, I mean, it is fair to point out that like texting is pretty cumbersome.

58:05.800 --> 58:10.320
So he didn't want to spend a lot of characters on romance, I don't think that that's so.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.200
He just said it was two characters.

58:12.200 --> 58:14.760
It was a capital P and a question mark.

58:14.760 --> 58:18.760
And then, and then in a follow up text, bada boop.

58:18.760 --> 58:20.920
And then a smiley, a winky face emoticon.

58:20.920 --> 58:24.040
Like yeah, we get, we didn't need the emoticon.

58:24.040 --> 58:28.640
I think we all got the intended purpose of the original message and my answer is yes.

58:28.640 --> 58:29.640
Tonight.

58:29.640 --> 58:30.640
Absolutely.

58:30.640 --> 58:32.920
At the Motel 12.

58:32.920 --> 58:36.400
Don't tell a soul.

58:36.400 --> 58:39.320
It's two Motel 6's back to back.

58:39.320 --> 58:42.840
I want you to pee on me between them.

58:42.840 --> 58:45.320
I mean, bada boop.

58:45.320 --> 58:48.600
What I would like to know her response, right?

58:48.600 --> 58:57.080
Like what he must've been getting a much different vibe than, than she was from their texts.

58:57.080 --> 59:01.680
Like it is a very sort of like, I don't know what if he said like, do you want to go see

59:01.680 --> 59:02.680
great Gatsby?

59:02.680 --> 59:10.760
And she said, Oh, I'd rather have someone pee on my hair at the moment he should mention

59:10.760 --> 59:11.760
that.

59:11.760 --> 59:12.800
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

59:12.800 --> 59:16.560
We sure appreciate everybody listening to the show.

59:16.560 --> 59:19.400
Thank you to everyone tweeting at us.

59:19.400 --> 59:27.920
Alonzo Durald, Kat, Jonathan Mitchell, Tyler Watt, Ian Johnson, Jacob Blocker, of course,

59:27.920 --> 59:38.360
our man, Drew Davenport, DM, Garrett Smith, Pepperoni Sinclair, Nicole Tompkins, and put

59:38.360 --> 59:45.840
together an East Coast MBMB AM meetup to send off our friend, the Triscuit off to, off,

59:45.840 --> 59:48.960
off to, he's, he's shipping out to Afghanistan.

59:48.960 --> 59:54.520
So we, we wish him all the best and we hope that they had a, a great time out there.

59:54.520 --> 59:57.720
And of course we'll keep him in our, our hearts and minds.

59:57.720 --> 59:58.720
Yeah.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.160
He's going to have a great time out in Afghanistan, just like chilling.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.160
I hope he just has a wonderful time.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.800
No, I think it'll be a real character builder.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.560
So I think he's got plenty of character.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.120
He's like fucking USA.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.120
He's fucking characters.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.120
Welcome.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.120
Thank you.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:18.920
I guess thank you for defending our, they actually had a beautiful banner at the, at

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:23.320
the meetup that just said, getting it nice.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.080
So unless that wasn't at the meetup and just at somebody's house, which either way I'm

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:32.320
just looking at Twitter and there's a lot of things on there.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.960
And we, we, we so appreciate you guys listening to the show and tweeting about it.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:42.280
If you want to share our sampler bit.ly forward slash MBMB AM 2013, it's a great way to get

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:46.120
people into the show if they're not already listening.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:52.280
I want to thank everybody who sent in Yahoo answers seriously, like 10 times as many as

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.280
I got last week.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.540
Like everybody fucking answered back my plea.

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:57.540
Thank you guys so much.

01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:01.080
I also want to thank John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme song.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:06.760
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.120
Fuck your daft punk album is what I'm saying.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.120
Daft punk?

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.120
No, thanks.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.120
Vampire weekend.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.120
Who needs it?

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.560
It's just this same album over and over again.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.440
Two quick max fun con reminders.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.720
One, we're going to be at max fun con.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.240
So if you're going to be there to start formulating questions in your head that you would like

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:30.200
to have answered at the live show and then come find us at some point during the weekend

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:35.120
so that maybe we can have you have your question answered live.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:40.560
And two, for all of you who will not be at max fun con, just remember that because we're

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.880
doing a live show, it always takes us a little bit longer to publish, so it'll probably be

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:44.880
a little bit late.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.920
We should also probably talk about the fact that we may have to miss an episode, not next

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:54.000
week but the week after when Justin and I are at E3.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.720
So just get prepped for the fact that June 10th may be kind of a dry one, by which I

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.720
mean non-existent.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.640
There won't be many jokes that week.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.720
Not a lot of jokes.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.720
Keep us in your heart still.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:09.880
Hope you won't forget about us.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.520
A third reminder for those of you who are attending max fun con, please don't speak

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.520
to me.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.520
No, talk to Justin.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.520
Talk especially to Justin.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.640
Talk to Justin but don't make eye contact.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.640
He's sort of like the face.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.080
No, don't make any jokes because then people will do it and I'll forget about the joke

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.480
and I'll think everyone's gone insane.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.360
He's like the face of the A-team.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.360
Our A-team.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.360
Here's what's important.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:35.360
When you see Justin, form a protective barrier around him but facing outward.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.280
Don't make Justin look at your eyes with his eyes.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.280
Don't make me uncomfortable.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.080
Be like, no, do say hi though.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.760
I'll be upset if you don't come say hi.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:49.000
And then be prepared to courier messages between Justin and John Hodgman and back because they

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
do not speak to each other.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.560
So much beef still.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:55.680
They've got, there's this crazy east coast, east coast beef with those two that I just

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.160
don't understand.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:01.360
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Drew Davenport.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.360
Thank you, Drew.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:07.040
It's by Yahoo answer user Dan G who asks, I'm going to read this in an appropriately

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:11.600
disappointed voice.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:18.520
Why does my son make laser gun noises in the bathroom?

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.760
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:20.760
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.760
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.760
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.760
Kiss your dad.

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.760
Square on the lips.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:48.520
Hey girls, do you want to say hey I want to?
