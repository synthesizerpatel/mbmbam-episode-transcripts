00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.640
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother made it,

00:46.640 --> 00:49.920
vice show for the modern era of breaking news, I'm Justin McElroy.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.920
Wait, is that the breaking news? I'm Travis McElroy.

00:51.920 --> 00:54.080
Now I'm setting people up for breaking news.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.280
Oh, it's a teaser.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.720
We've got our lead video game correspondent, Travis McElroy.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.720
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:00.720 --> 01:04.640
Travis, report in, lead video game expert and correspondent, Travis McElroy.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.240
What's the news in video games?

01:08.000 --> 01:13.200
So I think Bill Gates is playing Minecraft now. Hold on, let me read the story.

01:14.080 --> 01:18.000
He just joined my son's server, and he won't stop stealing all the diamonds.

01:18.960 --> 01:23.760
It looks like, oh yep, okay, so it looks like they're gonna buy Minecraft.

01:23.760 --> 01:28.640
You can't buy, you can't buy Minecraft, it's a world of infinite freedom

01:28.640 --> 01:30.800
and exploration and imagination, you can't.

01:30.800 --> 01:34.080
Yeah, don't be ridiculous, you need like 2.5 billion dollars.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.560
I'm gonna buy all the rainbows in the world.

01:36.560 --> 01:40.720
Oh, it looks like Bill Gates sneezed and accidentally bought Minecraft.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.440
Yeah, it's like trying to buy all the world's wishes.

01:43.440 --> 01:44.560
Yeah, we can't do that.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.480
He did that too, he did that in 2010.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.400
For two billion, a clean two billion.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.240
I wonder why my dreams died, I thought that was connected to turn of 30,

01:52.240 --> 01:54.240
but apparently Bill Gates bought my dreams.

01:54.240 --> 01:57.840
It's the energy by which he sustains his life now.

01:57.840 --> 02:02.080
But now he's using voxels, a voxel-based imagination engine.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.000
Fucking thanks for that Bill, Bill G.

02:06.080 --> 02:11.600
I've long suspected that the rich are not concerned about global warming

02:11.600 --> 02:16.720
because they have another, they have an escape plan that they're not telling us about,

02:16.720 --> 02:19.440
that's why they're accumulating that vast wealth

02:19.440 --> 02:25.120
to make an ark from which to leave the earth and possibly the solar system.

02:25.120 --> 02:32.000
Do you think that Minecraft is actually the vehicle

02:32.640 --> 02:38.400
by which the world's rich are going to exit this planet?

02:38.400 --> 02:41.680
They're going to basically join the mind stream.

02:42.720 --> 02:46.320
Hold on, are you talking like toys level shit?

02:46.320 --> 02:50.400
Where like we all think it's a game but really we're terraforming a far off planet

02:50.400 --> 02:55.200
and it's all real or they're going to like matrix into the Minecraft world?

02:55.200 --> 02:55.840
They're matrixing into Minecraft.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.080
Which weird movie are you referencing?

02:58.080 --> 03:01.520
What I'm saying is that my, I'm not, this is completely from my mind.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.280
This is like from my mind's eye.

03:03.280 --> 03:13.920
I think that America and the world's rich are going to download their ego into Minecraft

03:13.920 --> 03:18.320
and that will become the new utopia of the rich.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.120
So more like Captain Inn or more like-

03:21.120 --> 03:25.040
Stop trying to fucking put my genius in a pop culture box.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.800
I just wanna know, is it like Cool World?

03:26.800 --> 03:27.280
Like what are we looking at?

03:27.280 --> 03:28.800
It's nothing like Cool World.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.440
It's kind of like Cool World.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.800
It's kind of like Cool World.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.600
Are we talking about a snow dog situation?

03:36.320 --> 03:39.280
Are we talking about a snow dog situation?

03:39.280 --> 03:40.320
What about Out to Sea?

03:40.320 --> 03:44.160
Okay, have you seen A Walk Among the Clouds?

03:44.160 --> 03:44.560
Uh-huh.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.000
I've seen Boat Trip.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.400
Okay, have you seen Boat Trip?

03:49.440 --> 03:50.640
With Kuba Gooding Jr.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.480
Okay, it's like that.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.360
It's kind of like that.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.720
It's kind of like that.

03:56.000 --> 03:56.640
Straight talk.

03:57.200 --> 04:01.920
This is the fucking dumbest and worst thing ever $2.5 billion for a 300 year old game.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.200
Why didn't they email me?

04:03.200 --> 04:05.680
Hey Griffin, can we get you to sign off on this one?

04:05.680 --> 04:07.200
Ooh, 2.5 million.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.560
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.320
Sorry, dog, reread that letter.

04:10.320 --> 04:13.520
Oh no, that's far too much money, Bill Gates.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.600
Hey Griffin, is it 2007?

04:15.600 --> 04:17.040
Should we buy Minecraft?

04:17.040 --> 04:18.640
Is it 1991?

04:18.640 --> 04:19.840
Notch was just born.

04:19.840 --> 04:22.960
I'm going to buy his product ahead of time for $2.5 hundred.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.880
Sounds great.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.000
That's a great decision.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.600
That's a great decision.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.720
It's called the ground floor.

04:29.920 --> 04:37.600
You are on a spaceship overlooking the building because that building is a billion years old.

04:37.600 --> 04:42.880
And you just spent $2 for every year that that game has been on the earth.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.120
Bring it to a scale we can all understand, right?

04:45.120 --> 04:53.680
My maximum fund scooped up my brother, my brother and me, the brand in April of 2011.

04:53.680 --> 04:54.960
For $750 million.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.160
For $750 million.

04:56.960 --> 05:01.520
If they came to us now with $750 million, I would spit in Jesse Thorn's face.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.480
I would spit in his face.

05:02.480 --> 05:05.440
I would say, look at who you're talking to.

05:05.440 --> 05:06.480
Mm hmm.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.560
Bring the car around, right?

05:08.560 --> 05:13.200
Like, I would, but because we're, I mean, I'm massive.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.400
I guess massive would be the word.

05:14.400 --> 05:18.160
But what Microsoft has done, Microsoft did the equivalent of coming to my brother, my

05:18.160 --> 05:24.720
brother and me in two thousand two hundred and eleven and trying to buy the property.

05:24.720 --> 05:28.240
When we're more of a religion, wild science-esque religion.

05:28.240 --> 05:32.240
Yeah, we're just, our energies are contained within crystals.

05:32.240 --> 05:36.480
You light a magic torch behind it and we are projected into the world and then we say some

05:36.480 --> 05:37.360
shit about a horse.

05:39.360 --> 05:40.880
Uh, no, it's really bad.

05:40.880 --> 05:46.240
I don't have a video game podcast anymore, so I'll just have to tell you, to my brother,

05:46.240 --> 05:48.640
my brother and me audience, that's a crazy thing.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.280
Yeah.

05:49.280 --> 05:55.040
It would be like coming to the Beatles now and saying, I want to sign the deal.

05:55.040 --> 05:59.200
I just played, I played the Beatles rock band and I, I had never heard of you guys before,

05:59.200 --> 06:03.040
but I love your stuff, so I will need to buy all of you.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.320
I mean, that is what Apple did.

06:04.880 --> 06:05.920
Apple did do that.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.960
Uh, bad businesses.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.640
Apple did that to you, too, though.

06:10.640 --> 06:11.920
I feel bad for you, too.

06:12.560 --> 06:16.960
Apple, Apple went to you, too, and said, we'll give, is any man gonna buy your new album?

06:16.960 --> 06:19.600
And you two said, oh, Blimey, probably not, Gov.

06:19.600 --> 06:25.680
And then, uh, uh, Steve Jobs Jr., the new president was like, uh, what if we gave it,

06:25.680 --> 06:27.520
what if we forced everybody to take it?

06:27.520 --> 06:29.200
Oh, Gov, Blimey, that'd be great.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.240
You'll have to give us some money.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.040
How many dollars?

06:31.040 --> 06:31.760
Catorce.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.240
Fourteen dollars?

06:34.800 --> 06:36.720
I was never quite clear on that, right?

06:36.720 --> 06:37.520
How about a hundred?

06:37.520 --> 06:43.120
I thought catorce was just like a number and you can make it mean whatever you want it to mean.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.560
No, it's Spanish for 14.

06:44.560 --> 06:48.160
Like, you know, like supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, right?

06:48.160 --> 06:53.600
You just count up, it's like one, two, three, and then a number that can mean any number.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.520
Higher than three, right?

06:55.520 --> 07:02.160
The first iPod I ever owned was a secondhand U2 themed iPod that came with discography on the iPod.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.560
Yeah, they've been sucking that tea for a long, long time.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.800
Should we, uh, do advice?

07:06.800 --> 07:08.960
Yeah, don't buy Minecraft.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.000
Don't buy Minecraft.

07:10.000 --> 07:10.800
I mean, buy the game.

07:10.800 --> 07:11.760
It's a great game.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.960
Don't buy the game because you don't have to buy the game because it's free.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.800
You paid 2.5 million dollars.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.240
That's a horrible business model.

07:18.240 --> 07:21.440
I'm gonna buy McDonald's and also they give burgers away for free.

07:22.160 --> 07:22.880
Overhead.

07:22.880 --> 07:23.760
Who cares?

07:23.760 --> 07:24.560
Who gives a shit?

07:24.560 --> 07:25.360
Who gives a shit?

07:25.360 --> 07:25.860
Questions.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.160
Questions.

07:29.680 --> 07:33.760
I've been happily married for two years, but I could not come up with a passable way to address

07:33.760 --> 07:34.800
my mother-in-law.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.800
I know people usually call their mother-in-law mom or mother or just call her by this name,

07:38.800 --> 07:39.840
but it kind of freaks me out.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.960
Due to this situation, I usually avoid addressing her directly,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.640
which requires a good amount of effort in social gatherings.

07:46.640 --> 07:51.040
I try not to call her out directly, e.g. if we're on the same dinner table and she has the salt

07:51.040 --> 07:56.480
shaker in front of her, I would do without the salt shaker for that entire meal.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.600
That is cool.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.440
She's like a server standing just looming over the salt shaker.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.480
Can I get the salt?

08:02.480 --> 08:03.280
Uh, nevermind.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.720
Hey, why do you always have gravy on your sleeves?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.960
Well, it's because I'm a far reacher.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.840
How can I overcome this problem, brothers?

08:11.840 --> 08:12.720
And there's a name here.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.840
Patrasche just put this person's real name and that's not what we do.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.600
Especially not in this situation.

08:19.600 --> 08:24.080
We'll call them, we'll call them naughty in Nebraska.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.120
Naughty in Nebraska.

08:25.120 --> 08:25.440
Fine.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.320
Probably doesn't have anything to do with their question.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.680
That's the best nomenclature in Nome, Alaska.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.680
Horny and Corpus Christi.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.280
What do you guys call your mother-in-law's?

08:38.000 --> 08:38.480
Linda.

08:39.440 --> 08:39.840
Justin.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.400
Uh, you know, I've been,

08:44.880 --> 08:46.480
I've been getting more into mom.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.240
I've been saying mom more often.

08:48.240 --> 08:52.320
I found myself saying mom more often just because we've been family for a long time.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.400
It seems weird to say Mary.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.440
Let me ask you this.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.000
Since-

08:56.000 --> 08:57.920
It was a pretty natural thing that it's something I forged.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.040
It just seemed-

08:59.040 --> 08:59.600
Yeah.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.520
Since baby Chuck, did that evolve?

09:01.520 --> 09:05.440
Like, did she take on a grandmother type name from you?

09:05.440 --> 09:06.480
I've heard that before.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.800
No, I mean, probably as Chuck's older, I need to talk to Chuck now.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.480
I don't need to talk to Chuck at all.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.800
Some people talk to her and I'm like, she doesn't get it.

09:14.800 --> 09:15.360
That's weird.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.640
Stop wasting your breath.

09:16.640 --> 09:23.120
But like, I, no, I mean, it just sort of happened over time.

09:23.120 --> 09:26.960
I will admit, like, the first time it has to be like a conscious decision, I think.

09:26.960 --> 09:32.400
Like, I'm gonna say this now and it's gonna be kind of weird, but I'm just gonna like go for it.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.440
And then after that, like, it wasn't that strange.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.720
I mean, sometimes I say mom, sometimes I say Mary.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.760
It just kind of depends on the situation.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.720
Can I hit you guys with something I've been thinking about?

09:44.720 --> 09:45.440
Yeah.

09:45.440 --> 09:50.400
Why don't you just call, if you've got a mother-in-law or a father-in-law, just call them law.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.280
Just call them law.

09:53.280 --> 09:54.320
And like, you could use it.

09:54.320 --> 09:57.840
It's gender neutral and you can just use it whenever you want.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.920
And I think, I mean, it sounds tight if someone was like, hey, law.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.720
And I'd be like, yes, that's me.

10:04.720 --> 10:05.680
I am the law.

10:05.680 --> 10:06.480
Thank you for saying that.

10:06.480 --> 10:09.200
You could go with like law mom and law dad.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.480
Nope, you can't.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.240
Just law, but doesn't that get confusing?

10:12.240 --> 10:13.920
It's like, wait, me law or her law?

10:13.920 --> 10:16.480
No, it's context sensitive, Travis.

10:16.480 --> 10:21.200
You don't always have to explicitly say who the subject of any sentence is.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.360
People are smart enough to figure it out.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.160
It's like when you say you, that can mean like anybody.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.400
Or when you say Linda and you're in a room with a few Lindas in it.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.840
Maybe you're at a Linda convention.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.400
Maybe you're at LindaCon 2014.

10:34.400 --> 10:34.960
Exactly.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.560
Maybe you're the hired entertainment and maybe you should have practiced your songs a little bit.

10:40.560 --> 10:44.800
Hi, I'm Linda Ronstadt and thank you for bringing me here.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.280
I'm a Linda Ronstadt cover, Linda non-stat.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.320
Are there any Lindas in the house tonight?

10:52.320 --> 10:54.240
Lindas, let me hear you.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.320
You know what name I really like is Linda.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.200
It sure is great to be back in Corpus Christi, Texas.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.040
This is a tough one.

11:05.040 --> 11:09.600
I mean, I just, I have dropped the honorifics almost entirely for my life

11:09.600 --> 11:16.000
because people have names for a reason and it's just to let you know where they fit

11:16.000 --> 11:19.520
in the great big old filing cabinet we call the earth.

11:19.520 --> 11:20.400
Isn't that right, guys?

11:20.960 --> 11:23.840
But I think the best advice is to ask her.

11:23.840 --> 11:26.720
Be like, hey, oh, that's a cool conversation.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.840
Can I call you mom?

11:28.480 --> 11:32.560
That's not a fucking relationship bender.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.560
Make sure you're covered in-

11:34.560 --> 11:35.760
Excuse me.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.760
Can I, excuse me.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.440
You're on your knees pulling her apron.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.800
You're covered in food.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.560
Can I call you mommy?

11:43.440 --> 11:43.760
Yeah.

11:44.640 --> 11:48.080
Well, I mean, I thought this was kind of a throw it at the wall,

11:48.080 --> 11:51.520
see what sticks kind of conversation, but I didn't know you guys already had the answer.

11:52.960 --> 11:53.920
We don't have the answer.

11:53.920 --> 11:58.720
Listen, a lot of times on this show, you've been a part of this program for a long time now,

11:58.720 --> 12:00.800
Travis, you should know that we don't always have the answers,

12:00.800 --> 12:04.720
but we do know the absolute wrongest answer.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.200
And I believe that you certainly got the square right.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.600
Well, let me, okay, so let me take another shot of this.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.080
Okay.

12:10.080 --> 12:15.520
If you're at a point where you're not sure, then you should just call her by her name.

12:16.880 --> 12:17.680
Do you know her name?

12:17.680 --> 12:19.840
That is actually decent advice.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.840
Because, I mean, right now, I think it's like saying I love you.

12:23.840 --> 12:28.560
If you're not ready to call her mom or mother or anything like that, then don't do it.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.880
Because it's not at that point yet.

12:31.920 --> 12:34.560
I would say two years seems like a long time,

12:34.560 --> 12:37.920
but in the grand scheme of things, it's still pretty new.

12:37.920 --> 12:41.840
I honestly just got to a point where my mother-in-law had done me so many solids

12:41.840 --> 12:46.960
over our time together as relatives that if I didn't start calling her mom,

12:46.960 --> 12:48.880
I was going to start feeling really guilty.

12:48.880 --> 12:49.520
Yeah.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.520
Like, listen, you cannot be married anymore.

12:51.520 --> 12:56.080
You have like brought me, you've brought a McDonald's breakfast to the hospital like

12:56.080 --> 12:57.760
seven days in a row for me.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.920
So I'm just promoting you to mom.

12:59.920 --> 13:00.880
Congratulations.

13:00.880 --> 13:04.880
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

13:04.880 --> 13:05.440
Yes.

13:05.440 --> 13:06.480
You didn't answer.

13:06.480 --> 13:06.720
Yeah.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.200
Sorry.

13:07.200 --> 13:07.440
I do.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.240
I was thinking about it.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.880
You asked and I figured.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.840
Just across the board, we got really good questions this week.

13:13.840 --> 13:14.080
Okay.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.680
I really love them.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.480
Thanks for ruining the surprise.

13:18.480 --> 13:18.800
Okay.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.920
This Yahoo was sent in by Scuba Steve,

13:21.920 --> 13:25.040
and it's, I think, a pretty great transition off the last question.

13:25.040 --> 13:34.320
And that's by Yahoo Answers user Tony, who asks, is memory foam bad for sex?

13:37.200 --> 13:40.080
Thinking of getting either a memory foam mattress or a topper.

13:40.080 --> 13:40.640
Update.

13:40.640 --> 13:43.920
Also, I mean, good sex, not boring sex.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.440
Thanks for any insight.

13:46.400 --> 13:50.320
Oh, well, I'm quite clarified because memory foam is great for boring sex.

13:50.320 --> 13:57.280
I mean, I don't want to show my hand, but I make love like I'm slowly being absorbed by quicksand.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.280
I don't want.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.160
I don't want.

14:00.160 --> 14:00.960
Here's the problem.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.920
You can use a memory foam mattress.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.000
It'll make sex better.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.760
But only if you get a memory foam mattress after you've been having sex for a while.

14:11.760 --> 14:15.520
Because if you have sex for the first few times on a memory foam mattress,

14:15.520 --> 14:18.000
and then later you're still having sex on it,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.880
you're going to look at those previous indentations and think,

14:20.880 --> 14:23.280
ugh, what was I doing?

14:23.280 --> 14:24.880
Memory foam remembers.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.160
Don't remember that.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.080
What's with all the elbow imprints?

14:29.440 --> 14:30.800
What was I doing?

14:30.800 --> 14:33.680
The weird thing is when you plug your memory foam into your computer

14:33.680 --> 14:35.840
and you download all of the information

14:35.840 --> 14:38.800
and it gives you all the stats off of your previous lovemaking sessions.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.000
Yeah.

14:40.560 --> 14:41.680
Hey, it's me, Clippy.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.280
Good number of pumps there, Trout.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.080
You want me to keep track of your pumps?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.600
It's me, Clippy.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.400
I'll track your pumps for you, Trout.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.160
Hey, have you tried Minecraft?

14:54.160 --> 14:54.880
What if it's-

14:54.880 --> 14:58.240
I see you added a swerve, Trout.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.280
That's fantastic.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.320
You need to see a doctor, Trout.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.320
We can take the virus alerts.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.360
Hey, Trout, you need to compensate for the angle, Trout.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.480
You know what I'm talking about.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.960
You need to run a McCaffrey virus check, buddy.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.640
Can't help but notice not cuddling afterwards, you jackass.

15:14.640 --> 15:21.040
What if he ran it and his erect penis had a red squiggly line underneath it?

15:24.240 --> 15:25.040
Oh, boy.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.760
You spelled oh incorrectly.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.320
I mean, none of us own a memory foam, right?

15:37.280 --> 15:38.960
I know that we're making a lot of-

15:38.960 --> 15:42.720
I know we're making a lot of money on this show, but not that Minecraft money.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.720
No.

15:44.720 --> 15:51.680
It seems to me, though, like it wouldn't be ideal unless for some reason while you fuck,

15:52.480 --> 15:57.360
you like to have glasses of wine all around you that you don't want to spill over onto yourself.

15:58.080 --> 16:05.280
It's so funny to me because it seems like 40 years ago, the thing was like water,

16:05.280 --> 16:07.040
you know, water mattresses.

16:07.040 --> 16:07.200
Yeah.

16:07.200 --> 16:07.840
What are those called?

16:07.840 --> 16:08.400
Water beds.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.040
Water beds.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.880
Which is like the polar opposite of memory foam.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.520
Memory foam is like, oh, you can like bounce a bowling ball and nothing happens.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.920
And like a water bed is like, oh, you moved your elbow

16:17.920 --> 16:20.080
and you flipped the other person out of the bed.

16:20.080 --> 16:20.320
Yeah.

16:20.880 --> 16:26.000
Well, I think that making love, when you make love in a memory foam,

16:27.680 --> 16:33.360
you are nullifying a lot of the earth's natural physics and effects

16:33.360 --> 16:39.440
and a lot of the simple machines featured in a traditional mattress.

16:39.440 --> 16:44.160
And I think that, I mean, I love extreme restraints,

16:45.360 --> 16:47.920
but I get by with those simple machines.

16:47.920 --> 16:48.480
You know what I mean?

16:48.480 --> 16:50.240
Springs, levers.

16:50.240 --> 16:50.720
Screws.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.000
Thank you.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.040
Inclined planes, things like that.

16:55.040 --> 16:58.880
And in a memory foam, you are floating in the negative zone.

16:59.680 --> 17:00.320
You know what I mean?

17:00.880 --> 17:02.640
You are imprisoned in the negative zone.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.800
And you and Zod making love.

17:04.800 --> 17:05.600
Making love.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.520
And that can be pleasurable.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.800
Kneel before Zod.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.840
But I don't think it works for everyone.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.000
But isn't that true of all lovemaking, Griffin?

17:18.560 --> 17:21.360
Maybe one man's memory foam is another man's sleep number bed.

17:23.760 --> 17:26.160
Is another man's inflatable camping mattress.

17:26.160 --> 17:33.680
Sleep number bed would be great because I have always wanted a fuck number.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.160
That's something they do not feature in the advertisements.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.400
But you say, what's your sleep number?

17:38.400 --> 17:38.880
28.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.160
What's your fuck number?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.600
35.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.280
Yes.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.680
And then someone's like, is that the number of people you've slept with?

17:45.680 --> 17:48.000
And it's like, no, that number is zero.

17:50.800 --> 17:55.040
I just know my fuck number in preparation for that special day.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.640
They find that for you in the store.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.560
That number is zero and looking.

17:59.760 --> 18:00.720
Ladies.

18:00.720 --> 18:01.920
Zero plus.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.520
And then you say, why is it zero?

18:03.520 --> 18:05.520
And he says, true love waits.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.760
And it was a commercial for true love waits the whole time.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.280
Okay, guys.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.160
Marry, fuck, kill.

18:10.800 --> 18:11.280
Are you ready?

18:12.160 --> 18:13.200
Sleep number.

18:13.200 --> 18:13.520
Yeah.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.320
Memory foam.

18:14.320 --> 18:14.640
Yeah.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.240
Craftmatic adjustable.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.040
Oh, my God.

18:17.040 --> 18:25.360
I didn't kill the craftmatic just because it would kill you, I think, to try and make

18:25.360 --> 18:27.200
that two back piece up on that.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.560
You get fold up like a panini.

18:30.560 --> 18:31.760
The sexiest panini.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.840
Did you see someone did that with us in the Facebook group?

18:36.560 --> 18:37.600
I asked them.

18:37.600 --> 18:38.480
Did I win?

18:38.480 --> 18:39.040
Did I win?

18:40.080 --> 18:41.120
Nobody won.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.240
It was the worst.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.360
I often crash on friends' couches because I don't like driving drunk.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.320
Good for you.

18:46.320 --> 18:50.080
My friends are always cool with this because they'd rather me crash at their place than

18:50.080 --> 18:53.200
into another car or in a jail or into a jail.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.760
My issue with this is that I can't sleep with pants on.

18:58.960 --> 19:03.920
I usually get under a blanket, slip off my pants, sleep in just a shirt and undies.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.280
My question is this.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.840
Am I making myself too at home when I do this?

19:07.840 --> 19:11.120
Or is this okay as long as I don't walk around their home in my undies?

19:11.120 --> 19:15.280
That's from sleepless when I have pants on in Birmingham, Alabama.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.160
Oh my God, I have done this move.

19:18.160 --> 19:18.800
I know.

19:18.800 --> 19:19.280
Oh me?

19:19.280 --> 19:20.160
I'm a gentleman.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.600
I'm sleeping in my pants.

19:22.320 --> 19:28.160
As soon as the lights are off, the covers are on, those pants are outskis.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.520
Can we talk about Bachelor in Paradise?

19:31.520 --> 19:32.240
Just for a second.

19:32.240 --> 19:35.600
Just for like, give me 45 seconds to please talk about that.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.520
You get a 45 second visa.

19:37.520 --> 19:41.600
In the finale, there is this couple, Sarah and Robert.

19:41.600 --> 19:46.000
There is this couple, Sarah and Robert, and you could tell that Robert wasn't feeling it.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.720
I think he just liked that good Paradise scene.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.920
He liked being a part of the beach scene.

19:55.040 --> 19:58.640
They went to the fantasy suite on their last day there and nothing happened.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.440
I knew that it was a whole situation because Sarah was like,

20:03.440 --> 20:05.280
yeah, Robert slept in the bed with me.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.040
He never took his jeans off.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.280
I was like, that's not love.

20:09.280 --> 20:10.800
That's not intimacy.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.960
That is what a murderer does.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.240
Nobody can be comfortable in jeans.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.840
Nobody can be comfortable in jeans.

20:20.240 --> 20:23.840
If you're doing this frequently enough that you had to write into a comedy

20:23.840 --> 20:28.080
advice podcast to ask us about it, maybe you need to start carrying like a little

20:28.080 --> 20:31.120
overnight bag with you when you go to parties at friends houses

20:31.120 --> 20:33.200
and take some like comfy sleep pants.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.680
Yeah, that's the secret that I have.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.680
I bring sleep shorts with me.

20:38.640 --> 20:39.440
Where?

20:39.440 --> 20:40.080
What?

20:40.080 --> 20:41.360
Because he's everywhere he goes.

20:41.360 --> 20:42.560
He's got everywhere.

20:42.560 --> 20:46.000
Well, if I'm going to be sleeping in another locale, I bring sleep shorts.

20:47.760 --> 20:50.800
So, you know, like, I don't think I basically bring huge basketball shorts.

20:50.800 --> 20:56.480
He's he's I don't think he's ever planning on sleeping at the maybe you need.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.040
I got it.

20:57.040 --> 20:57.520
I got it.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.080
I got it.

20:58.080 --> 21:02.240
You don't want to carry a fucking gym bag around with you to the to the bars.

21:02.240 --> 21:03.040
You know what I mean?

21:03.040 --> 21:09.920
But you can sew your seeds of comfortable pants at all of the houses of your friends

21:09.920 --> 21:13.520
that you think you are going to pass out at.

21:13.520 --> 21:16.560
Oh, like a hide a key like you bury it in the yard.

21:16.560 --> 21:22.160
Yeah, you're going to get probably pay a nominal fee for this service of rent for your shorts.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.720
And then you place that strategically at a dozen locations.

21:26.720 --> 21:30.800
You know, fuck, I'm I'm real, real fucked up.

21:30.800 --> 21:33.120
I'm going to go to sleep, but I can't.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.160
I've got my jeans on.

21:34.160 --> 21:38.720
And they'll be like, Don't worry, Bryce, because you planned for this.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.240
You planted this pants seed.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.280
And now you get to reap the sweet rewards of it.

21:43.280 --> 21:48.480
You change into those comfy, dry shorts and you feel the breeze on your legs and you sleep.

21:48.480 --> 21:49.920
You sleep the sleep angels.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.920
Sometimes I just go full nude.

21:53.920 --> 21:54.880
No, you don't.

21:54.880 --> 21:55.840
No, no, you don't.

21:55.840 --> 21:56.720
You would never.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.280
You wouldn't.

21:57.280 --> 21:58.080
And you haven't.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.600
Don't lie to be cool.

22:00.160 --> 22:04.160
Well, you've been in you have both been in hotel rooms with me where you have seen me

22:04.160 --> 22:06.400
go to bed as a shorts clad gentleman.

22:06.400 --> 22:11.200
You son of a bitch, that was a place of trust.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.000
That was a place of belief and safety.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.560
I'm sorry, Justin, but that's a huge difference between being in a hotel room that you've

22:18.560 --> 22:23.840
paid to be in and just go and commando on your friend's couch where he also watches.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.880
I don't know, Bachelor in Paradise, it sounds like.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.800
Yeah, that's weird.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.000
That's weird.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.040
Is it worse or better?

22:31.760 --> 22:32.640
Worse.

22:32.640 --> 22:33.840
It's 100 times worse.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.120
What I did was worse.

22:35.120 --> 22:35.680
No.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.360
Balls on the couch is worse.

22:37.360 --> 22:41.520
So you're more you're very, very comfortable with my naked body, is what you're saying.

22:42.880 --> 22:46.480
You're very, very, very comfortable with Justin.

22:48.480 --> 22:52.720
At this point, yes, I mean, I've grown up with it.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.240
It's 30 years in the making.

22:54.240 --> 22:54.640
Yeah.

22:54.640 --> 22:58.400
When I look at your naked body, Justin, on Reddit.

23:00.080 --> 23:00.960
Thank you.

23:00.960 --> 23:06.320
When I look at your Reddit nudes, I basically I just feel like I'm looking at my body.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.040
You know what I mean?

23:07.040 --> 23:13.440
Like genetically, like it's it's that's those are my that's my scrotum.

23:14.720 --> 23:15.120
Say it.

23:15.120 --> 23:15.680
Say the word.

23:16.480 --> 23:17.520
Finish it.

23:17.520 --> 23:18.800
It's my scrotum, basically.

23:19.680 --> 23:20.720
I can't stress enough.

23:20.720 --> 23:28.720
This is triply not OK if you're in either briefs or really loose fitting boxers.

23:28.720 --> 23:33.760
Now that's drunk passed out on our friend's couch in briefs is not the best scene.

23:33.760 --> 23:39.760
I think I think boxers is a is a horse of a different color compared.

23:39.760 --> 23:42.480
I'm talking those loose fitting, like really thin.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.960
There's nothing keeping the fly together ones.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.160
You're in boxer briefs.

23:46.160 --> 23:46.960
You've got it.

23:46.960 --> 23:50.480
You got full coverage and it's almost like you're wearing tiny shorts.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.280
Exactly.

23:51.280 --> 23:55.120
I want to actually can I bring up a related underwear issue?

23:55.120 --> 23:58.720
And I'm hoping that either you guys or listeners can help me with this.

23:59.280 --> 24:02.800
When I buy boxers and I wear boxers from excuse me.

24:02.800 --> 24:08.960
When I wear boxers, I like the boxers that have like stretch to them,

24:08.960 --> 24:13.600
like are a fabric that has some flexibility and stretching.

24:14.240 --> 24:20.640
And I keep buying boxers that don't have that that are just like a solid,

24:21.440 --> 24:24.160
stiff fabric with no flex or stretch.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.520
And I don't know how to avoid it.

24:25.520 --> 24:29.920
Is there some sort of language that I should be looking for on the packaging

24:29.920 --> 24:33.440
that tells me that I'm getting the kind of boxers I like?

24:33.440 --> 24:34.480
Am I alone here?

24:36.480 --> 24:38.240
You got to look at what the material is.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.840
Well, now you look at what I'm looking for,

24:39.840 --> 24:42.880
because I bought a hundred percent cotton that are both swung both ways.

24:42.880 --> 24:46.960
There should be a sticker on the package somewhere that describes its viscousness rating.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.040
That is true.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.160
I've never seen that.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.440
Where are you buying these shorts again?

24:51.440 --> 24:54.240
Again, everywhere we're online.

24:54.240 --> 24:55.760
I thought maybe paying.

24:55.760 --> 24:59.920
I thought maybe like the cheap ones were the ones that didn't have any sort of stretch to them.

24:59.920 --> 25:00.640
No, no, no.

25:00.640 --> 25:03.120
It's like sometimes you could buy expensive ones that don't have any stretch.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.320
Go to Target.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.520
They bind.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.240
Go to Target.

25:07.360 --> 25:12.080
They'll let you just take one out of the package and then you throw it at the wall

25:12.720 --> 25:16.720
and then tell me, call me when that happens and I'll tell you where to go from there.

25:17.440 --> 25:18.320
Okay, good.

25:18.320 --> 25:20.400
If you don't mind, I'm going to get you on the horn beforehand,

25:20.400 --> 25:23.200
just because I don't want to get into a situation where

25:23.200 --> 25:26.880
I'm just a guy throwing underwear at a wall and not a guy throwing underwear at a wall and talking.

25:26.880 --> 25:29.120
Well, not any wall at the underwear wall.

25:29.120 --> 25:29.360
Yeah.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.320
Oh, okay.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.280
There's a wall.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.040
Listen, there's going to be a wall in Target.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.680
You're fucking 42 years old.

25:35.680 --> 25:37.120
How do you not know this?

25:37.120 --> 25:39.840
How do you not know about underwear walls and viscousness ratings?

25:39.840 --> 25:40.720
See your first day.

25:40.720 --> 25:41.280
Read a book.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.480
Have you been living with uncomfortable genitals your whole time here on earth?

25:47.360 --> 25:49.040
I'm going to check my underwear right now.

25:49.040 --> 25:49.440
Okay.

25:49.440 --> 25:50.480
No, they're binding.

25:50.480 --> 25:51.040
They're binding.

25:51.040 --> 25:51.280
Okay.

25:51.280 --> 25:52.080
These are binding.

25:52.080 --> 25:52.400
Okay.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.760
Oh, I hate that.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.080
I would be uncomfortable with that level of detail,

25:56.080 --> 25:59.040
but it's basically my underwear and balls too.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.080
Let's go to the money sign.

26:00.080 --> 26:11.200
Speaking of undies.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.720
Speaking of undies.

26:12.720 --> 26:15.360
Oh man, that is not intentional.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.280
But hey, me undies.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.200
I'll tell you what I need to do.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.320
You know what I need to do?

26:20.320 --> 26:24.880
I need to just go to meundies.com slash my brother

26:24.880 --> 26:27.520
and get some of the best underwear on earth.

26:28.800 --> 26:32.160
I talk about how this ruins my day wearing bad underwear.

26:32.160 --> 26:36.400
Me undies is going to scoop me up in the most delectable,

26:36.960 --> 26:41.600
comfortable underwear I've ever owned and whisk me away.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.400
And if I go to meundies.com slash my brother,

26:44.400 --> 26:47.040
I'm going to get 20% off my first order.

26:47.040 --> 26:47.680
Fuck yeah.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.120
And then you're going to love it, Justin.

26:49.120 --> 26:52.000
You know what the viscousness rating on these undies are?

26:52.640 --> 26:53.280
A plus.

26:53.280 --> 26:53.760
Infinite?

26:55.120 --> 26:56.480
Well, not infinite.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.400
That would just be like wearing a cloud.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.360
Wearing mood slime.

27:00.480 --> 27:01.920
No, it's going to feel so great.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.000
It's a delectable weave.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.040
You're going to love how these undies-

27:05.040 --> 27:06.320
A delectable weave?

27:06.320 --> 27:10.720
You're going to love how these undies feel on your breezeway.

27:10.720 --> 27:11.920
I guarantee it.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.120
And it's not just undies.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.720
They've got like t-shirts and stuff too.

27:14.720 --> 27:19.600
They've got pretty much your under clothes, it's covered.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.280
Men, women, everyone.

27:21.280 --> 27:25.360
You can take a t-shirt and you can flip it upside down

27:25.360 --> 27:26.560
and put your legs through the arm holes

27:26.560 --> 27:27.680
and use that as underwear.

27:27.680 --> 27:30.240
And it's still going to feel better than the bullshit joke ass

27:30.240 --> 27:32.000
underwear that you're wearing right now.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.440
I'm looking at the banner across the top of the me undies website

27:35.440 --> 27:39.360
and it threw me for a second because it says men, women, more.

27:39.360 --> 27:42.560
And then I thought it said refer, but it said refer.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.960
And that was a much different thing you can buy.

27:44.960 --> 27:45.600
We got you.

27:45.600 --> 27:46.160
What do you need?

27:46.160 --> 27:47.040
Shirts?

27:47.040 --> 27:47.680
Underwears?

27:50.800 --> 27:52.160
Did you need a little bit-

27:53.040 --> 27:55.360
Did you want a tank top or a dank top?

28:00.720 --> 28:03.280
Did you want underwear or did you want pot?

28:06.320 --> 28:07.360
They got seat clothes too,

28:07.360 --> 28:10.800
so if you're looking for something to drunkenly pass out in, covered.

28:10.800 --> 28:14.560
Or in a fog of that seat, see Sticky Mary Jane.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.040
Your pass out game is going to increase tenfold.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.240
I guarantee it.

28:20.240 --> 28:23.120
I'm on their website buying underwear right now

28:23.120 --> 28:27.520
and I also have to say that they have some really attractive models.

28:27.520 --> 28:30.080
Men, women, whatever kind of butts you want to look at,

28:30.080 --> 28:31.600
they have got them here for you.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.360
Butts and butts and butts and butts.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.640
Butts for miles.

28:35.360 --> 28:36.160
Bait for days.

28:36.160 --> 28:39.040
They literally made all the models line up

28:39.040 --> 28:44.640
and form a human wall of butts for three and a half miles.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.680
Butts for miles.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.240
That's my-

28:48.240 --> 28:50.720
Okay, so anyway, that's me undies slashing my brother.

28:50.720 --> 28:51.920
Go there, get 20% off,

28:51.920 --> 28:55.360
get freaking comfortable for once in your life.

28:55.360 --> 28:55.680
Please.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.160
How can you buy more undies?

28:58.160 --> 29:00.000
Well, I'm glad you asked.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.240
If you knew 72 hours from now that you'd have $35,000,

29:04.240 --> 29:05.120
what would you do with it?

29:05.120 --> 29:07.120
I would quit this stupid fucking podcast.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.160
Hands down.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.600
Hands down.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.880
Maybe more normal people,

29:12.880 --> 29:15.280
maybe they could pay off credit cards

29:15.280 --> 29:17.760
or start a business or a home improvement project.

29:20.960 --> 29:25.440
Why would you want a project about home improvement?

29:25.440 --> 29:28.080
Oh man, I fucking threaded the needle.

29:28.080 --> 29:32.720
I don't get a lot of the MVP jokes of the show.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.680
So it feels really good when I know that

29:35.680 --> 29:37.040
I just really fucking nailed it.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.640
And I had the one that like,

29:38.640 --> 29:40.880
we're gonna do the YouTube breakout video for.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.160
I fucking love it.

29:42.160 --> 29:42.960
It never happened.

29:42.960 --> 29:45.440
So I know it just happened and it feels great.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.200
Well, if you're looking to start on a big project,

29:47.200 --> 29:50.000
I think Prosper is gonna be your answer.

29:50.000 --> 29:50.240
Yeah.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.480
Tell me about Prosper, Travis.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.440
I mean, it's a little hard.

29:54.880 --> 29:55.920
It's a financial thing.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.640
So it's a little hard to explain on a comedy podcast.

29:58.640 --> 30:01.840
But basically the concept is it's like a peer to peer lending.

30:01.840 --> 30:05.520
So say, you know, I'm moving cross country and I say,

30:05.520 --> 30:07.920
I think that this is gonna end up being, yes.

30:07.920 --> 30:10.240
I think this is gonna end up costing me $20,000.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.760
I don't have $20,000.

30:11.760 --> 30:12.720
You sure don't.

30:12.720 --> 30:13.920
But I go to a bank and I say,

30:13.920 --> 30:15.360
hey, I need $20,000 to move.

30:15.360 --> 30:16.720
And they're like, yeah, that's not really

30:16.720 --> 30:18.720
the kind of loan we give out, right?

30:18.720 --> 30:21.040
In the olden days, I'd be done.

30:21.040 --> 30:21.600
That would be it.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.120
And like, well, I guess I'll wait two years

30:23.120 --> 30:24.880
and save the money, right?

30:24.880 --> 30:28.160
But with Prosper, I just go on Prosper

30:28.160 --> 30:30.240
and I make a post, you know,

30:30.240 --> 30:32.800
I make a listing that say, I'm looking for this.

30:32.800 --> 30:35.920
So then everybody, the lenders on Prosper

30:35.920 --> 30:37.920
are all other Prosper users.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.760
So they go, okay, great.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.360
This seems like a good investment.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.520
He's got a good rating.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.880
He's paid back his other stuff.

30:44.880 --> 30:45.920
I'm gonna do this.

30:45.920 --> 30:48.880
And then you give that person a loan

30:48.880 --> 30:49.920
and they pay you back.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.960
So basically it cuts out the middleman of the banks

30:52.960 --> 30:55.600
and makes it so that you are loaning your money

30:55.600 --> 30:57.120
and getting that money paid back.

30:57.120 --> 30:59.120
I like the sound of this.

30:59.120 --> 31:01.600
Yeah, I mean, it's a genius idea.

31:03.200 --> 31:06.240
Basically, you'll never have to set foot in a bank.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.960
There's no outrageous fees, no raising interest rates.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.800
I think it's brilliant.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.280
If you go to prosper.com slash my brother,

31:14.000 --> 31:15.280
you can check your rate instantly

31:15.280 --> 31:16.880
and it won't affect your credit score.

31:16.880 --> 31:19.120
And they're offering NBNBA listeners

31:19.120 --> 31:22.240
a $50 visa prepaid card when you get a loan.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.760
There's some text we have to read here,

31:23.760 --> 31:24.720
so let me do that.

31:24.720 --> 31:27.040
There's some text we have to read here, so let me do that.

31:27.040 --> 31:29.280
Other restrictions apply.

31:29.280 --> 31:33.200
See cipher program and visa prepaid card details.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.840
All personal loans are made by Web Bank,

31:35.840 --> 31:39.360
a Utah Chartered Industrial Bank member FDIC.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.760
Equal housing lender.

31:43.840 --> 31:44.480
Go check it out.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.440
I hope it, I hope.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.520
Does it still legally apply?

31:49.520 --> 31:51.440
It still legally applies.

31:51.440 --> 31:51.760
Okay.

31:52.800 --> 31:53.520
What is this voice?

31:53.520 --> 31:55.200
Sorry, I missed the intro to this voice.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.680
It's several voices combined.

31:57.680 --> 32:03.760
It's female Woody Allen and also jerky voice apparently.

32:04.720 --> 32:07.200
I have a favor to ask everybody.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.600
Well, not a favor because a favor makes,

32:10.240 --> 32:12.640
it sounds like I'm asking you to do something unpleasant.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.440
What I'm asking you to do will be most pleasurable.

32:15.440 --> 32:16.400
I guarantee it.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.720
I want you to check out-

32:18.720 --> 32:20.640
Griffin guarantees your pleasure.

32:20.640 --> 32:23.840
I want you to check out the Lovecraft Brewing Company.

32:24.640 --> 32:28.400
They are, they got a Kickstarter campaign going right now

32:28.400 --> 32:33.920
to open up a farmhouse style craft brewery up Washington.

32:35.040 --> 32:40.800
And they are crafting beers that are all Lovecraftian in nature

32:41.360 --> 32:46.400
like the Hypnos IPA, the Elder God Beer de Gard,

32:46.400 --> 32:51.840
a lot of Bruce Hulu barley wine, a lot of really, really great stuff.

32:51.840 --> 32:53.280
So yeah, they are raising money.

32:53.280 --> 32:57.280
They have asked for our help to signal boost their campaign.

32:57.280 --> 33:00.800
And they have a lot of really great rewards for backers.

33:00.800 --> 33:03.600
They've got a couple of limited edition prints, coasters,

33:03.600 --> 33:06.960
t-shirts, glassware, and lots of different levels.

33:06.960 --> 33:10.160
And if you live in Washington, you should help out with this anyway

33:10.800 --> 33:13.520
because I mean, I'm sure it's going to be delicious,

33:13.520 --> 33:16.480
I mean, I'm sure it's going to be delicious, but also-

33:16.480 --> 33:19.920
It would also be nice for Washington to finally get like a craft brewing company.

33:20.720 --> 33:23.760
You know, something that scene, it's ready to start.

33:23.760 --> 33:27.440
It's time to start a craft brewing company in Washington finally.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.480
Yeah, for once.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.240
So anyway, yeah, Lovecraft Brewing.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.080
Check it out on Kickstarter, Facebook, or Google.

33:33.040 --> 33:33.840
Great.

33:33.840 --> 33:37.440
Kevin Locky, I got a message for you from Nicholas Bale.

33:37.440 --> 33:40.800
He says, hey Kevin, you board game playing goof.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.560
I couldn't think of what to get you for your birthday.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.240
So here's a message from me to you.

33:44.800 --> 33:45.840
Happy birthday.

33:45.840 --> 33:46.640
All right.

33:46.640 --> 33:50.720
Enjoy this message from the three wisest brothers I know

33:50.720 --> 33:54.720
sent one month before your special day, so it's probably late.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.520
You're a cool guy who's fun to game with

33:57.520 --> 33:59.680
and I hope this year is your best yet.

34:00.320 --> 34:03.120
Listen, Nicholas, don't fucking throw shade on us.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.880
So it's probably late.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.320
Maybe it's not late.

34:06.320 --> 34:09.040
I thought that was Nicholas throwing shit on himself and saying-

34:09.040 --> 34:10.400
I got a podcast for you.

34:10.400 --> 34:13.440
I didn't get in quick enough because I know I have to request them

34:13.440 --> 34:14.720
like eight months in advance.

34:14.720 --> 34:15.120
Yeah.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.800
I got a podcast for you on this network.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.840
If you want to throw shade, it's called Throwing Shade.

34:19.840 --> 34:24.800
And I think your brand of comedy will be more welcome there, Mr.

34:24.800 --> 34:25.920
It's also a great show.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.120
It's also a really good show.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.960
It's like fun to listen to, but still also-

34:28.960 --> 34:30.560
You turd.

34:31.680 --> 34:32.480
Thanks for your money.

34:32.480 --> 34:36.000
Thanks for the money and happy birthday, Kevin.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.600
Thanks for your turd money.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.760
Thanks for the turd money, Nicholas.

34:39.760 --> 34:42.560
It smells like turds, but it spins like gold.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.320
Hi, my name is Ruchikesh Hereway

34:46.320 --> 34:48.640
and I have a podcast called Song Exploder.

34:48.640 --> 34:51.280
In each episode, a musician takes apart one of their songs

34:51.280 --> 34:54.000
and piece by piece tells you the story of how it was made.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.720
You get an inside look into the creative and technical process

34:56.720 --> 34:58.960
and a unique view of a song by hearing just the drums

35:00.960 --> 35:05.360
or just the guitars or say just a Wurlitzer piano.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.360
If you're a fan of music, if you make music,

35:07.360 --> 35:09.040
or if you just like to learn how things are made,

35:09.040 --> 35:11.200
come check it out on Maximumfun.org.

35:11.200 --> 35:11.700
Thanks.

35:14.160 --> 35:15.600
I got a Yahoo here.

35:15.600 --> 35:16.320
All right.

35:16.320 --> 35:21.280
And it was sent in by a level 300 Emerald member shaman,

35:21.280 --> 35:22.320
Drew Davenport.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.120
Yeah, Drew.

35:23.120 --> 35:23.920
Thank you, Yadru.

35:23.920 --> 35:28.400
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Hazza, who asks,

35:29.360 --> 35:32.880
what do you think Brutus would reply to see the song

35:32.880 --> 35:38.320
Et Tu Brute?

35:38.320 --> 35:42.000
I'm doing a project based off the fault in our Stars movie

35:42.000 --> 35:42.880
poster.

35:42.880 --> 35:45.680
The top cloud says Et Tu Brute.

35:45.680 --> 35:48.880
The bottom cloud would have to be something after that.

35:48.880 --> 35:52.480
I was going to use Et Tu Caesar, but I don't think that

35:52.480 --> 35:53.600
makes much sense.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.100
Nope.

35:55.200 --> 35:58.080
What would be a good relatively short quote to put?

35:58.080 --> 35:59.520
Doesn't have to be a real quote.

35:59.520 --> 36:02.560
Also, if you have better quote instead of the Et Tu Brute,

36:02.560 --> 36:04.320
something having to do with Brutus and Cassius,

36:04.320 --> 36:05.120
that would also work.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.480
So we're helping this person do homework, it sounds like.

36:08.480 --> 36:12.800
And it sounds like it's an English teacher who's trying

36:12.800 --> 36:14.000
to be fun, I guess.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.360
I'm thinking like Et Tu Brute?

36:17.360 --> 36:19.200
Yeah, Et Tu Brute.

36:19.200 --> 36:19.700
Yeah.

36:20.080 --> 36:20.580
Maybe?

36:21.200 --> 36:23.120
That would be like Et Three Brute.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.240
No, I don't think that's how Latin works.

36:27.920 --> 36:28.800
I love the play.

36:29.440 --> 36:31.440
I think it's the only Shakespeare play I've ever been

36:31.440 --> 36:32.480
and I played Casca.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.640
You were excellent, by the way.

36:34.640 --> 36:34.960
Thank you.

36:35.920 --> 36:39.040
I don't want to brag, but I was fucking awesome.

36:39.040 --> 36:42.400
And I got really good reviews from the New York Post.

36:44.720 --> 36:48.000
But I do think that it could be improved if when Caesar's like,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.320
you did this, this is how you do me.

36:51.200 --> 36:55.040
If Brutus was like, yeah, you basic bitch.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.520
You've just been Brutus.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.720
Travis, you've done a lot of like-

37:00.720 --> 37:02.640
And starring Aaron Paul as Brutus.

37:02.640 --> 37:06.160
You've done a lot of like Shakespeare bullshit,

37:06.160 --> 37:07.840
a lot of follies in your life.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.560
So you're probably better at Latin than I am.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.640
How would you say in Latin?

37:12.640 --> 37:13.280
Yeah, that's right.

37:13.280 --> 37:14.480
You basic bitch.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.760
Ath they, ite re, ou ye.

37:19.760 --> 37:20.560
No, you didn't do it.

37:21.120 --> 37:22.000
Come on.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.400
That was low, low, low hanging fruit.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.000
I went on Google Translate.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.840
You went on Dad Joke Translate.

37:27.840 --> 37:33.440
It'll change your regular jokes to dad jokes.

37:36.960 --> 37:37.520
Do you know what I mean?

37:37.520 --> 37:38.000
Like that scene-

37:38.000 --> 37:39.920
It's a real talk, but real talk.

37:39.920 --> 37:43.200
There's so many amazing quotes from Caesar

37:43.200 --> 37:45.600
that why would you pull the one that's basically like,

37:45.600 --> 37:46.880
really, Brutus?

37:46.880 --> 37:47.520
Really, dog?

37:48.080 --> 37:48.480
Really?

37:49.600 --> 37:52.080
That's the line where like, yeah, this is Brutus.

37:52.080 --> 37:56.000
Because he put it in Latin, this is just brilliant writing.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
He's just saying, you too, Brutus?

37:58.000 --> 37:58.240
Yeah.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.320
Like, yeah, let's do it.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.280
What if he'd be like, what if in response Brutus is like,

38:04.400 --> 38:06.160
it's pronounced Brutus.

38:08.800 --> 38:09.360
You dummy.

38:09.360 --> 38:09.760
Everybody's been-

38:09.760 --> 38:10.800
This is why you get stabbed.

38:10.800 --> 38:11.920
You don't know anyone's name.

38:12.640 --> 38:14.880
Everybody's been saying it the whole play.

38:16.400 --> 38:19.200
Your last words is a fuck up.

38:19.200 --> 38:19.520
And then you get him again.

38:19.520 --> 38:22.000
Why did you just start speaking Latin?

38:24.000 --> 38:25.120
We're Roman.

38:25.120 --> 38:28.320
Did the knife hit the part of your brain for English?

38:30.320 --> 38:32.000
Do you guys think in plays,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.640
the person who plays Julius Caesar thinks like,

38:35.680 --> 38:39.360
for like a second, every night before the stabbing scene,

38:39.360 --> 38:44.800
thinks like, what if one of these jokesters has a real knife

38:44.800 --> 38:48.400
and thinks about like, I might get stabbed for real though.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.840
But then the show must go on, so you just gotta lie there and die.

38:51.840 --> 38:55.440
Oh God, what a believable, stirring performance that'd be.

38:55.440 --> 38:57.120
If I was playing Julius Caesar,

38:57.120 --> 38:58.960
I'm the sort that every night before I get stabbed,

38:58.960 --> 39:00.640
I would think, maybe not tonight.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.560
Then what am I going to say in the play though?

39:04.560 --> 39:05.280
Fight them off?

39:05.280 --> 39:05.920
Uh-huh.

39:05.920 --> 39:08.160
Maybe this night, maybe tonight I'll win.

39:08.160 --> 39:09.040
I'll make a-

39:10.160 --> 39:13.920
Maybe tonight they won't make a heel turn,

39:13.920 --> 39:15.920
and it'll just be at work,

39:15.920 --> 39:18.480
and I'll just pop out like nobody's business.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.240
You hear, speak hands for me.

39:20.240 --> 39:23.840
You pull out a fucking bow staff, a couple of sighs,

39:23.840 --> 39:28.000
like, nope, fuck your hands.

39:28.000 --> 39:28.800
Yes, and.

39:29.520 --> 39:32.800
Yeah, that would be fucking tight.

39:33.520 --> 39:34.560
That would be sweet, right?

39:35.280 --> 39:38.320
Is the fault in our stars a reference to Julius Caesar?

39:38.960 --> 39:39.280
Yeah.

39:39.920 --> 39:40.560
I didn't know that.

39:41.120 --> 39:41.600
Travis.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.720
I mean, I've been doing Shakespeare for the last five years,

39:44.720 --> 39:46.400
but I haven't been paying attention.

39:46.400 --> 39:47.920
No, not that close of attention.

39:47.920 --> 39:48.960
I've just been coasting.

39:48.960 --> 39:50.640
You've been floating on that me undies weed.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.720
I got a question for you guys.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.800
Often when I arrive at the office or a restaurant,

39:56.800 --> 39:59.920
I want to wash my hands because the subway is a little gnarly.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.000
I usually lock the bathroom door when I do this,

40:02.000 --> 40:03.280
but since I'm not using the toilet

40:03.280 --> 40:04.320
and I'm only in there for a minute,

40:04.320 --> 40:06.240
locking the door feels pretty useless.

40:06.240 --> 40:09.360
But if I stop locking the door, what if someone walks in?

40:09.360 --> 40:12.160
Should I keep locking the door only when hand washing

40:12.160 --> 40:14.960
or risk a weird moment to avoid the hassle?

40:14.960 --> 40:17.680
Listen, we can, that was from Gmail.

40:17.680 --> 40:20.720
We can burn through this one in 20 seconds.

40:20.720 --> 40:22.560
You shouldn't lock the door

40:22.560 --> 40:24.960
when you go to the bathroom to wash your hands,

40:24.960 --> 40:27.680
because why wouldn't you want to brag about the fact

40:27.680 --> 40:29.120
that you're washing your hands?

40:29.120 --> 40:31.680
I can't envision a scenario in which someone walks in

40:31.680 --> 40:32.880
and you've got soapy hands and it's like,

40:32.880 --> 40:35.440
uh, I don't know, don't know.

40:36.640 --> 40:38.320
God, you tell no one.

40:39.360 --> 40:41.120
You take this to your grave, Steven.

40:41.920 --> 40:44.000
Situation for me would be a little more like,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.080
come on in, come check this clean boy.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.720
I'm doing the nails too.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.000
This isn't just a water rinse.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.280
I did the soap and everything.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.720
No one's gonna walk in and be like,

40:52.720 --> 40:55.040
is that soap on your hands or come?

40:58.320 --> 41:00.880
On the other hand, I also don't know what the scenario is

41:00.880 --> 41:03.520
where someone walks up, they try the knob, it's locked,

41:03.520 --> 41:04.480
and then you walk out and they go,

41:04.480 --> 41:06.320
you were just washing your hands, weren't you?

41:06.320 --> 41:07.840
Well, what if it's a freak?

41:07.840 --> 41:10.640
Okay, what if it is a single serving bathroom, right?

41:10.640 --> 41:13.520
No stalls, no stalls, no area stall to be seen.

41:13.520 --> 41:15.760
And somebody just like tests the door.

41:15.760 --> 41:16.800
It's open.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.720
They already have their pants around their ankles.

41:18.720 --> 41:23.040
They turn around, do a flip 180, pop down on that toilet,

41:23.040 --> 41:26.400
start just tearing the lever off,

41:26.400 --> 41:28.960
and then they realize that you are in there.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.200
I think that the concern is more like,

41:31.200 --> 41:33.120
I'm in this physical space where dumps happen.

41:33.680 --> 41:36.480
To be honest, I don't know why you wouldn't just lock the door.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.120
Because you want people to see you washing your hands.

41:39.120 --> 41:39.760
I just-

41:39.760 --> 41:41.200
Maybe announce as you're walking in,

41:41.200 --> 41:43.440
I'm just washing my hands, so I'm not gonna lock the door,

41:43.440 --> 41:45.520
but please don't come in and start pooping while I'm in here.

41:45.520 --> 41:46.240
Yeah.

41:46.240 --> 41:48.880
See you all in like, tops 45 seconds.

41:48.880 --> 41:52.320
I don't understand people who don't lock the door reflexively.

41:52.320 --> 41:57.040
Just like, thank God, finally, a few moments of peace.

41:57.840 --> 42:00.560
Just a few moments to myself away from the rest of them.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.080
A few moments of peace.

42:03.840 --> 42:04.640
I'm with you, Justin.

42:04.640 --> 42:05.280
Just lock the door.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.120
I guess.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.440
No one will judge you for locking the door,

42:09.440 --> 42:11.760
but it will be weird if someone walks in and you're in there.

42:11.760 --> 42:13.120
Even if you're just washing your hands,

42:13.120 --> 42:16.880
especially if it's a small, like there's just a sink and a toilet in the bathroom,

42:16.880 --> 42:17.680
and they walk in and it's like,

42:17.680 --> 42:19.040
oh, sorry, I didn't know anyway.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.880
Because they'll see you and think,

42:20.880 --> 42:22.880
if I had walked in 10 seconds earlier, they might still be peeing.

42:22.880 --> 42:24.400
I would have seen Dong, yes.

42:24.400 --> 42:24.720
Yeah.

42:24.720 --> 42:25.680
Absolutely.

42:25.680 --> 42:27.040
What are you doing, you sicko?

42:27.040 --> 42:30.000
Why do you want me to see you do that thing?

42:30.000 --> 42:32.960
Unless they see you walk in and they can time out,

42:32.960 --> 42:34.320
like, oh, it's only like 35 seconds.

42:34.320 --> 42:35.200
Probably just washing his hands.

42:35.200 --> 42:38.400
Because everyone times it out no matter what you say.

42:38.400 --> 42:41.280
And also, why did you wash your hands if you didn't use the bathroom?

42:41.280 --> 42:43.520
Did you kill somebody?

42:43.520 --> 42:43.920
Killer?

42:45.760 --> 42:49.680
Hey, Steve, have you noticed that Jerry washes his hands every morning when he comes in?

42:49.680 --> 42:50.640
What's his deal?

42:51.520 --> 42:52.800
I don't know, but he's not pooping.

42:52.800 --> 42:53.520
I timed it out.

42:55.360 --> 42:56.240
Look at my logs.

42:56.960 --> 42:57.520
Stop it.

42:59.520 --> 43:00.320
Do another question.

43:01.600 --> 43:01.840
Yeah.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.000
Over the past few weeks in university,

43:04.000 --> 43:06.800
I've noticed several people, both men and women,

43:06.800 --> 43:11.520
sitting their disgusting bare feet on the back of chairs in front of them during lectures.

43:12.480 --> 43:15.200
How do I nicely and subtly let these people know

43:15.200 --> 43:17.040
they are human monsters who need to stop?

43:17.840 --> 43:19.200
That's from the barefoot belligerent.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.600
You gotta tell on them to the teacher.

43:22.720 --> 43:24.080
Excuse me, teach.

43:24.080 --> 43:24.960
Hey, teach.

43:24.960 --> 43:25.120
I don't want-

43:25.120 --> 43:25.920
Yo, teach.

43:25.920 --> 43:26.880
Beat these feets.

43:26.880 --> 43:30.000
I'm trying to make friends over here and have a great college experience,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.640
but Brenda won't get her fucking dirty feet off the table.

43:32.640 --> 43:34.240
This little piggy went to disgusting.

43:34.240 --> 43:34.720
Mm-hmm.

43:34.720 --> 43:37.200
I'm trying to enrich myself with education.

43:38.480 --> 43:40.160
I feel like this is a much bigger problem.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.600
Whenever I go to a movie theater,

43:41.600 --> 43:44.960
I feel like two out of three people are putting their feet up.

43:44.960 --> 43:46.800
Maybe not bare feet, maybe still in shoes,

43:46.800 --> 43:48.560
but up on the back of the seats.

43:49.200 --> 43:51.520
And it's like, were you born in a barn?

43:51.520 --> 43:53.200
Like who, why would you do that?

43:53.200 --> 43:54.560
It's so upsetting to me.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.960
Why would you think like, this is a cool thing.

43:56.960 --> 43:58.480
I know I'm in public and this is like-

43:58.480 --> 43:59.040
Because it feels-

43:59.040 --> 44:00.320
A place where a bunch of other people hang out.

44:00.320 --> 44:01.760
It feels so good.

44:02.400 --> 44:04.080
It also feels good not to wear pants.

44:04.080 --> 44:06.160
I'm not going to do that listening to a lecture.

44:06.160 --> 44:09.600
Is the problem with this that we, the decent people of the world,

44:09.600 --> 44:10.960
are just not speaking up enough?

44:12.000 --> 44:14.880
Does this person owe it to the rest of us to just stand up and say,

44:14.880 --> 44:18.080
put your shoes on and put your feet down?

44:18.080 --> 44:19.920
Oh, and maybe the person will be like, thank you.

44:19.920 --> 44:20.960
I was waiting to see.

44:20.960 --> 44:22.160
Nobody said anything.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.680
I never had boundaries before.

44:23.680 --> 44:26.560
My parents didn't, they were like helicopter parents,

44:26.560 --> 44:29.200
but they never like trained me in how to be a decent human.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.120
Thank you for giving me boundaries.

44:31.120 --> 44:31.680
Now I know.

44:31.680 --> 44:33.520
The person stands up and turns around.

44:33.520 --> 44:34.800
It was Jason Mraz.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.160
He says, you set me free.

44:37.120 --> 44:40.080
He turns ethereal and floats into the air and he evaporates.

44:42.320 --> 44:45.120
You ever see people with their bare feet up like on dashboards

44:45.120 --> 44:46.320
in like the passenger seat?

44:46.320 --> 44:47.920
I got to hoot the passenger seat,

44:47.920 --> 44:50.400
but like feet up on the dashboards on long drives.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.440
That pisses me out too.

44:51.440 --> 44:52.160
No, I mean, that was fine.

44:52.160 --> 44:54.720
Not as much, not as much, but it's still troubling.

44:54.720 --> 44:58.080
Do you ever Google pictures of the bare feet of the guy from Dashboard Confessional?

44:58.640 --> 44:59.140
Yeah.

44:59.760 --> 45:00.640
Chris Carrabba's.

45:00.640 --> 45:03.920
Do you ever Google pictures of the bare naked ladies?

45:03.920 --> 45:06.320
I'm going to just real quick and treat myself.

45:08.240 --> 45:13.760
Hey, on that note, Google, if I could ask everybody Googling a favor,

45:14.880 --> 45:21.280
it would be great if anytime I do a Google search on an actress,

45:22.480 --> 45:25.200
Or any human woman.

45:25.200 --> 45:33.200
Any human woman, the very, very, very first auto complete response was not feet.

45:33.200 --> 45:35.600
That would be like amazing.

45:35.600 --> 45:39.760
If I could just like investigate the career of Miss Juliana Margulies,

45:39.760 --> 45:44.960
like on my own accord and find out like when the year she was active on ER,

45:44.960 --> 45:50.320
that sort of thing, without like the very first response being pictures of her feet,

45:50.320 --> 45:52.080
that would be like the best for me.

45:52.080 --> 45:55.280
I gotta tell you, Justin, it's both sides of the aisle too,

45:55.280 --> 46:03.040
because if you type CH into Google, it autofills Chris Carrabba's feet from Dashboard Confessional.

46:03.920 --> 46:07.200
Chris Carrabba's, and then in parentheses, from Dashboard Confessional,

46:07.200 --> 46:10.000
and his luscious feet is what it autofills.

46:10.000 --> 46:10.880
Just by CH.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.600
That's, man, people need to get their Google habits fixed,

46:15.600 --> 46:16.480
because this is breaking my heart.

46:16.480 --> 46:18.000
Or start using Ask Jeeves.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.880
Yeah.

46:22.880 --> 46:25.760
What if all the feet searches have been Ask Jeeves the whole time?

46:25.760 --> 46:27.920
What a delicious tendency.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.600
The Achilles tendons are my weakness.

46:37.680 --> 46:39.680
Thank you guys so much for listening.

46:39.680 --> 46:42.160
Guys and gals for listening too.

46:42.160 --> 46:44.960
I say guys, but I don't really mean that gendered, but I guess it has gendered roots.

46:44.960 --> 46:48.400
That probably means that English doesn't have the plural pronoun.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.040
It has y'all.

46:49.040 --> 46:54.720
Yeah, people make fun of y'all, but that's actually just a correction in English anyway.

46:55.600 --> 46:58.400
Thank you for listening to our program, my brother, my brother, and me.

46:59.120 --> 47:05.760
You can tweet about our show using the NBNBAM hashtag or at NBNBAM on Twitter.

47:05.760 --> 47:10.880
If you wanna get in on a huge social media awakening right now,

47:10.880 --> 47:12.800
I guess that's not overstating things too much,

47:12.800 --> 47:16.400
you should go to the my brother, my brother, and me appreciation group.

47:16.400 --> 47:21.200
It is a public group that is, I mean, it's ballooning out of control.

47:21.200 --> 47:22.240
I think I can say that.

47:22.240 --> 47:29.520
It is a massive, massive group that is growing like gangbusters for no reason that I can detect.

47:29.520 --> 47:30.560
No reason at all.

47:30.560 --> 47:33.280
People, it looks like they're posting every five minutes.

47:33.280 --> 47:34.560
Somebody's posting something on there.

47:34.560 --> 47:35.440
It's fantastic.

47:35.440 --> 47:37.920
There's a lot, I tell you what there is though.

47:37.920 --> 47:43.040
There are a lot of people asking about what episode they can find a certain bit.

47:43.040 --> 47:46.320
It would be amazing if we can harness this Facebook group to finally make the Wiki

47:46.320 --> 47:49.440
that we've been needing for all these many years.

47:49.440 --> 47:55.040
Or if we can harness it to making us have our own fucking Wikipedia page, which we never had.

47:55.040 --> 47:56.080
Yeah, bullshit.

47:56.080 --> 47:56.800
Come on.

47:56.800 --> 48:00.800
Anyway, just search for my brother, my brother, and me appreciation group on Facebook

48:00.800 --> 48:02.480
and you can join it and it'll make you happy.

48:03.280 --> 48:06.400
You should also check out our new Tumblr's up, yes?

48:06.400 --> 48:08.640
Oh yes, it is.

48:08.640 --> 48:09.280
And what's the-

48:09.280 --> 48:10.720
mmbam.tumblr.com.

48:11.440 --> 48:16.160
It's just, you know, like a regular Tumblr, it's got lots of stuff on it.

48:16.160 --> 48:20.160
I wish you two would add something to it ever instead of just making me do it all the time.

48:20.160 --> 48:21.760
I put videos up on it.

48:21.760 --> 48:22.080
Maybe I'll start like-

48:22.080 --> 48:23.360
Travis, I'm looking at it right now.

48:23.360 --> 48:24.640
You have put nothing up on it.

48:24.640 --> 48:27.440
I don't understand, I guess, what Tumblr's for.

48:27.440 --> 48:30.880
I just thought it was like where people put their tasteful nudes.

48:32.800 --> 48:34.400
That might not be accurate.

48:34.400 --> 48:35.680
I'll try to write some stuff on it.

48:35.680 --> 48:38.640
I mean, I don't use it to put like your-

48:38.640 --> 48:39.920
Don't use it as like a diary.

48:39.920 --> 48:40.480
It's not like-

48:40.480 --> 48:41.520
I'll post my musings.

48:42.240 --> 48:42.800
Oh God.

48:43.920 --> 48:48.080
Here's some observations on today's news from my skewed perspective.

48:48.800 --> 48:49.680
It's Travis.

48:49.680 --> 48:50.160
Travis.

48:52.160 --> 48:55.760
These aren't going to be the most popular opinions, but goddammit, they're mine.

48:57.760 --> 48:58.080
I want to-

48:58.080 --> 48:58.640
Go check that out.

48:58.640 --> 48:59.920
Check out our YouTube page as well.

48:59.920 --> 49:00.720
I put-

49:00.720 --> 49:03.120
So a lot of people really liked the Adventure Zone.

49:03.120 --> 49:08.800
If you want to share it with a friend, we made a YouTube video of the whole episode.

49:09.920 --> 49:11.520
It's a little bit easier to share.

49:11.520 --> 49:15.440
It's a little bit more consumable for people that maybe don't normally listen to podcasts.

49:15.440 --> 49:16.720
So it's on there.

49:17.680 --> 49:18.400
So go check it out.

49:19.520 --> 49:20.160
I want to thank-

49:21.760 --> 49:22.720
I almost said Yahoo.

49:23.760 --> 49:24.480
Goddammit.

49:25.040 --> 49:28.160
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song,

49:28.160 --> 49:30.880
It's a Departure, off the album, putting the days to bed.

49:30.880 --> 49:32.640
It's a truly fantastic album.

49:32.640 --> 49:36.400
I was doing some cooking this past weekend.

49:36.400 --> 49:40.800
I had it playing on vinyl, and it was like 58 degrees here in Austin.

49:40.800 --> 49:44.640
I had all the windows open and just smelling that fall foliage.

49:44.640 --> 49:45.200
That's a recipe.

49:45.200 --> 49:46.080
That's chili making.

49:46.080 --> 49:46.640
That's-

49:46.640 --> 49:48.640
Oh my god, it was a dream, is what it was.

49:48.640 --> 49:50.160
So get that album.

49:50.160 --> 49:51.280
It's perfect for chili.

49:52.320 --> 49:54.560

50:04.560 --> 50:05.760
They won't do that.

50:05.760 --> 50:08.240
They might even give you a little bit of a nug of weed.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.480
Check out all the other great shows on MaxFun.

50:12.240 --> 50:13.760
This is always the most challenging part.

50:13.760 --> 50:14.260
Let's go.

50:14.800 --> 50:18.320
Saw Bones, of course, starring our very own Justin McElroy and Sydney McElroy.

50:19.760 --> 50:25.920
Throwing Shade, Jordan Jesse Goh, Bullseye, Memory Palace, Song Exploder,

50:25.920 --> 50:32.160
Song Exploder, Risk, One Bad Mother, Throwing Shade, Wham Bam Pow.

50:33.360 --> 50:34.560
What am I forgetting?

50:34.560 --> 50:35.360
Slam Bam Pow.

50:36.000 --> 50:36.800
Slam Bam Pow.

50:36.800 --> 50:37.760
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

50:38.800 --> 50:39.440
The Goose Down?

50:40.000 --> 50:40.720
The Goose Down.
