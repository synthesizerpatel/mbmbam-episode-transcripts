The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.720
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

00:48.720 --> 00:54.960
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:54.960 --> 01:00.320
Hey, I'm your sweet baby brother in 30 Under 30 Media Luminary back in a big way, Griffin McElroy.

01:00.320 --> 01:05.520
Hey guys, you know how last week we tried to be earnest and we really nailed it,

01:05.520 --> 01:10.320
and we were earnest the whole time? Yeah, I said a lot of shit, and I meant all that shit.

01:10.320 --> 01:15.840
I meant all of it. I was thinking about it, and this week, what if we keep that old train a-rollin',

01:15.840 --> 01:21.440
and we focus on the 20 funny things in your life without your love, and this week,

01:21.440 --> 01:27.760
we aim for another goal, and we try to be relatable. Okay, that could be good.

01:27.760 --> 01:35.360
Let's be honest, we've gotten so big, or big shots, as they say, palling around with the glitterati,

01:35.360 --> 01:41.920
and I'm feeling maybe we might have lost touch a little bit with, you know, your quote-unquote

01:41.920 --> 01:48.160
every person. Yep, yep, yep, yep. So I think a big tenet of this, and it's a thing I've been meaning

01:48.160 --> 01:55.680
to talk to you two boys about for quite some time now, is we have been awfully cavalier

01:55.680 --> 02:02.640
about open and frank conversations about getting our buttholes sprayed by our toilets

02:02.640 --> 02:08.480
in the form of bidet seeding, and obviously it's important. Obviously it's important.

02:08.480 --> 02:13.520
It's an important facet of my life, Justin's life, Travis's life, keeping it clean down there,

02:13.520 --> 02:21.280
getting the spray is... I love it, and I need it, but I don't think the rest of America

02:21.280 --> 02:28.320
is ready to go there with us yet. So Griffin, you're saying if we wanted to make it more relatable,

02:28.320 --> 02:33.520
instead of saying, like, I don't think I could live without my bidet, you would say something like,

02:33.520 --> 02:38.000
I don't think I could live without, you know, every time I go to the bathroom, going outside

02:38.000 --> 02:43.040
and spraying myself off with a hose. I think that that's better, yeah, because bidet is like a French

02:43.040 --> 02:50.560
word, and I think a lot of people are still kind of sore about all the Iraq War stuff, and so

02:50.560 --> 02:56.560
if we could just call it a booty super soaker or something fun like that. I couldn't live without

02:57.760 --> 03:04.080
my booty spray. My booty spray is... but that sounds like actually something that could come

03:04.080 --> 03:09.520
out instead of go in. I could live without that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:09.520 --> 03:17.920
I gotcha. So that's the big... that's sort of my big note. No more bidet chat. Maybe we have a separate

03:17.920 --> 03:27.840
podcast for, you know, folks more on our level. That is definitely... I love that impulse, Griffin,

03:27.840 --> 03:31.760
and I just want to kind of grab it and just kind of tweak it a little bit, give it a little

03:31.760 --> 03:37.600
tickle on the tummy and see if I can't change that frown upside down, and maybe instead of not

03:37.600 --> 03:42.480
talking about bidets, we could try to educate people a little bit more about how they're

03:42.480 --> 03:50.240
actually surprisingly affordable and hygienic. And good for the environment, saves on TP.

03:50.240 --> 03:56.000
Good for the environment, saves on TP. Now, Justin, I like this, because I was afraid we

03:56.000 --> 04:02.160
were becoming unrelatable, but maybe it's everyone else that is on... we have become so relatable that

04:02.160 --> 04:05.520
people no longer know how to relate to us, so we need to educate them. Because they're

04:05.520 --> 04:09.840
daunted by how relatable we are. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, we're so relatable and

04:09.840 --> 04:15.120
approachable, and, you know, we're basically three everymen over here, and so we need to

04:15.120 --> 04:20.160
educate everyone else. Three everymen, you hear that, you're like, wow, that's a lot of men,

04:20.160 --> 04:25.280
actually. Now come to think of it, that may be too many men for me to sort of talk to.

04:25.280 --> 04:30.480
It's like an infinite men. I think also, in the spirit of the Max Fun Drive coming up pretty soon,

04:31.200 --> 04:38.800
maybe we just... let's have a conversation at least about cutting Bugatti boys,

04:38.800 --> 04:44.320
the segment in our show where we talk about all our Bugattis, and our new colors of Bugattis,

04:44.320 --> 04:50.240
and the news about new Bugattis that are coming out. I have actually been edit... okay, this is

04:50.240 --> 04:56.080
embarrassing. I hate to do this here. I have been editing out Bugatti boys for the last four years.

04:56.960 --> 05:03.760
It's like 45 minute long segments. My Bugattis! Yeah, if you guys have been wondering why those

05:03.760 --> 05:09.600
sponsorship dollars have not been pouring in, it is because I have been editing the 45 minute long

05:09.600 --> 05:16.640
Bugatti segment we do every week. I can't believe I'm about to have to even ask this, but Justin,

05:16.640 --> 05:20.960
you've left in Tiger Cub Chat, right? Where we talk about all the Tiger Cubs we've adopted?

05:21.600 --> 05:27.200
So what I do with that is because we endeavor to make Tiger Cub Chat as long as the actual episode

05:27.200 --> 05:36.640
itself, I have edited in underneath the episode at a really low volume. So if there's ever a long

05:36.640 --> 05:41.360
period of silence, that's where we're all talking so much. Talking over each other, cross talking,

05:41.360 --> 05:48.080
it's so we can cover up the chat about how we've adopted cubs and have named them after our

05:48.640 --> 05:55.120
favorite US presidents. That's constantly underneath the audio of us sort of prattling

05:55.120 --> 06:00.080
on about ghosts and horses and whatnot. Can y'all even just, and I'll cut this out,

06:01.040 --> 06:09.840
but if we could get a bidet in the Bugatt. Oh shit, dude. A Bugatti day. A Bugatti day.

06:10.640 --> 06:16.400
A bidegati. Oh man, we sound like, it's hard not to sound like Adam Sandler when you say that word.

06:17.120 --> 06:22.400
And maybe a little special harness in there for my Tiger Cub. Yep, gotta keep him safe,

06:22.400 --> 06:28.800
gotta keep him safe. So no, no, no. Hey, rear facing. Rear facing. Okay. Until he's at least

06:29.520 --> 06:35.360
40 pounds. A rear facing bidet. Oh, a harness. I was trying to imagine what a rear facing bidet is

06:35.360 --> 06:42.400
because I think that would just sort of hit my front stuff. Then he's rear facing until he's

06:42.400 --> 06:47.760
three and turning around. And I like to think of that as roar facing because he's directing

06:47.760 --> 06:52.160
the roars directly at you. So from rear facing to roar facing. Justin, at what point can I use

06:52.160 --> 06:58.960
my Tiger Cub as a living hood ornament on my Bugatti? Oh, dipping your Tiger Cub in copper

06:58.960 --> 07:04.960
and freezing it for time immemorial? No, no, no, no, no. Let me be clear. He's fully animate.

07:06.160 --> 07:11.040
Right, inside of the copper, yeah, but you do need to keep him, eventually he's going to turn

07:11.040 --> 07:16.400
into a tiger and that's going to be- Well, then I just flush him down the toilet after using the

07:16.400 --> 07:21.600
bidet. Guys, this is exactly the kind of shit we shouldn't talk about on the show anymore.

07:21.600 --> 07:26.240
Also, because we're burning up all our material. I don't know what we're going to talk about during

07:26.240 --> 07:30.240
the segments that we will continue to record despite the revelation that they are not included

07:30.240 --> 07:35.920
in the show. Yeah, sure. Why don't we do the regular show here, Bugatti boys? Yeah, we got to

07:35.920 --> 07:39.680
say, I've got the whole afternoon cleared out for all the different shows that we have to record.

07:39.680 --> 07:45.600
Excellent. Our first question is this. At my college, we have a buffet style cafeteria.

07:45.600 --> 07:51.360
I grabbed a plate of the chef's meal of the day, sat it down on an open table with my backpack,

07:51.360 --> 07:56.160
and then went to go get a drink. I came back with my drink and enjoyed my meal before wondering

07:56.160 --> 08:00.960
where my backpack was. And then I looked down two tables to see my backpack and my original plate

08:00.960 --> 08:08.080
of food. I had sat down at the wrong table and had eaten someone else's identical meal without

08:08.080 --> 08:16.160
realizing it. I quickly left afterwards out of fear and shame, correct? Brothers, in what way could I

08:16.160 --> 08:20.960
atone for this sin to the unknown individual whom I accidentally dine and dashed on? That's from

08:20.960 --> 08:30.800
Momo in Virginia. Momo. Momo. Momo. Their instincts were correct. Yes. Fear and shame,

08:31.600 --> 08:35.680
that's perfect. That's a good blend to start with. That's great for me.

08:37.280 --> 08:44.400
Can I tell you the part of this question that haunts me? So Momo had time to eat the entire meal,

08:44.400 --> 08:50.560
which means that whoever the original owner of said meal was approached,

08:50.560 --> 08:56.320
saw them eating the food and said, well, what are you going to do? And left.

08:57.760 --> 09:05.760
Well, maybe. I mean, that's a possibility, Travis. I'm really challenged by the exfiltration from

09:05.760 --> 09:13.040
the situation because option one is realize the mistake, stand up, walk away, and there's a sort

09:13.040 --> 09:19.120
of zone of, I like to think of it in social situations as a zone of culpability. Like if

09:19.120 --> 09:25.280
you can make it, if you can make it 10 feet away from a thing, you can sort of like blend into the

09:25.280 --> 09:30.880
crowd and maybe even start announcing like, who did this? Who did this thing? Who could have done

09:30.880 --> 09:37.680
this? Sure. But I think that the other option, so that's option one. Option two is you realize

09:37.680 --> 09:43.520
your mistake and then take it to the trash. And then you are running into the possibility of this

09:43.520 --> 09:51.120
person seeing you take their food. Didn't see you eat it, but did see you pick up their plate,

09:51.120 --> 09:55.840
take it to the garbage and empty it out, which is also very bad.

09:55.840 --> 10:00.880
I was trying to work out where the other person was in this scenario. And I think I've got it

10:00.880 --> 10:06.400
cracked. This person walked back to what they thought was their seat and saw a different person

10:06.400 --> 10:12.160
that wasn't them sitting in it and eating their food. And so their, their mind immediately told

10:12.160 --> 10:18.800
them, Oh, I thought I was sitting there, but that's not my food. So it's not. And then they

10:18.800 --> 10:23.360
kept walking and they saw the identical plate of food, but they saw a backpack by it. And so they

10:23.360 --> 10:32.400
said, Hmm, that is also not my food. I should probably just leave or go get home. Now we've,

10:32.400 --> 10:37.600
this is where we encounter the question mark that haunts me. Maybe they're still wondering

10:37.600 --> 10:42.240
the cafeteria to this day. I probably got something else to eat. Well, hopefully,

10:43.760 --> 10:48.240
what can you do to make it up? I mean, you got to find them first if you're going to make it up

10:48.240 --> 10:52.160
for them, because otherwise you could just kind of start buying plates of food and leaving them

10:52.160 --> 10:59.440
around like you're some sort of, you know, pelt hunter or something that you're trying to catch

10:59.440 --> 11:05.120
a hungry student. Um, you gotta find them. I don't know what you do for that. Is this a

11:05.120 --> 11:11.040
missed connection? That's what I was going to say. Yes. This seems like maybe, maybe you could even

11:11.040 --> 11:16.640
go even more grassroots and just post flyers. Like, did you get a meal and somebody snarfed it?

11:17.360 --> 11:23.040
I was the snarfer. I owe you one. It's me. Hey everyone. It's me. The snarf. Thanks for

11:23.040 --> 11:27.120
coming to my Facebook page. I am looking for a person who likes spaghetti,

11:27.120 --> 11:33.840
but not in a strong enough way to say something when encountering someone else eating it.

11:34.400 --> 11:39.360
Moma, what did you do? What did you do with your original plate of food?

11:39.360 --> 11:40.400
Good question.

11:40.400 --> 11:45.680
Cause now you just have a big plate of cold spaghetti and you got to decide like,

11:46.240 --> 11:52.000
am I going to have to eat? Okay. There's three options. One, people see you empty it into the

11:52.000 --> 11:57.200
trash. Wasteful Ricky. Not good. Especially since it does look like you ate your food and then

11:57.200 --> 12:05.040
walked over and took someone else's food. I'm full. Everyone should be full. I'm throwing this in the

12:05.040 --> 12:13.600
trash kids. I'm done. Get back in the car. That's possibility. One possibility to slide it into your

12:13.600 --> 12:20.160
back pack and you have to get a new backpack, but at least you've tamped down the shame. Three is

12:20.160 --> 12:27.520
you eat a second plate of delicious chef's spaghetti. And that's fine. I guess it's a lot

12:27.520 --> 12:28.800
of carb. Maybe you do a half marathon or something.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.720
During college though, you can do it.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.920
Yeah, that's a good point.

12:31.920 --> 12:37.600
When I was in college, I had one meal at the cafeteria that was included in my plan a day

12:37.600 --> 12:43.040
and it was all you can eat, as you said, buffet style. So I would just go in and hurt myself with

12:43.040 --> 12:48.000
food, but I was like 20. So I barely even felt it. You know what I mean? And then I'd go home and

12:48.000 --> 12:50.960
sleep for 14 hours or whatever because I could.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.160
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

12:54.160 --> 12:54.640
I'd love that.

12:54.640 --> 12:55.200
Yes, please.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.640
Here's one that was sent in by Brian. Thanks, Brian.

12:59.760 --> 13:03.440
It's from Yahoo Answers user muhahaha. Who asks?

13:03.440 --> 13:04.720
Oh, not a great start.

13:05.920 --> 13:14.960
How to still look perfect in a farm. So me, my family and cousins are going to my grandmother's,

13:14.960 --> 13:21.200
my grandfather's farm for vacation for like two to three days and I need to look perfect. Thank you.

13:23.600 --> 13:30.240
Oh, wow. What an open-ended, like perfect, like, are you, are you gramming it? Is that it?

13:30.240 --> 13:34.000
Or is this just like, if someone saw you, they'd be like, they totally belong here.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.320
Travis, don't be fucking obtuse, dude.

13:36.320 --> 13:40.640
They need to look perfect on, while in their grandfather's farm for two to three days.

13:40.640 --> 13:47.520
Now, so this can be tough. What I would do personally, and listen, I'm speaking relatably

13:47.520 --> 13:54.480
here. I would hide toiletry kits throughout the farm that include maybe some concealer,

13:55.520 --> 14:01.200
new deodorant, maybe even like a new shirt so that I can constantly look fresh no matter what

14:01.200 --> 14:08.240
work I've been doing. And, you know, and then what's great about that is if you don't use them,

14:08.240 --> 14:13.360
maybe the animals will and you have some, yeah, some fresh looking cows out there or whatever.

14:13.360 --> 14:17.520
They'll love your cream. That's for sure. They're going to get all over that.

14:17.520 --> 14:17.760
Yeah.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.720
But let's talk about clothes.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.220
Uh-huh.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.240
Perfect in this. Sorry, go ahead.

14:25.280 --> 14:28.240
Dungarees. Now you go ahead.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.160
Dunkaroos.

14:31.600 --> 14:36.880
I've decided in the grand tradition of evolution of the show that I'm going to start outsourcing

14:36.880 --> 14:43.840
some of these to Korra, which is like the smart, it's like the actual good alternative.

14:43.840 --> 14:46.480
It's a positive universe, Yahoo Answers.

14:47.680 --> 14:52.560
And so there's a question here, what do they call the outfits that farmers wear?

14:53.360 --> 14:58.160
And I thought that that would be perfect, right? Because you're getting kind of a,

14:58.160 --> 15:02.160
you want to get the look right, right? Because if perfect in this scenario is to be like the

15:02.160 --> 15:05.920
perfect farming look, is that fair? Can we grant this conceit?

15:05.920 --> 15:06.240
Okay.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.040
I mean, I got, yeah.

15:07.680 --> 15:16.000
So Janice here says has worked with farmers for decades and she answers clothes.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.280
Oh, all right.

15:17.280 --> 15:23.280
I'm sure some farmers wear coveralls or overalls, which is what TV shows and movies

15:23.280 --> 15:27.760
would have us all think farmers wear. But most of the farmers I know just wear clothes.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.240
So like a suit?

15:28.240 --> 15:32.320
Depending on the work. I know farmers who wear long sleeve plaid shirts

15:32.320 --> 15:37.280
and others who wear sports wicking shirts. Some wear jeans while others wear shorts.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.280
This is getting a little Dr. Seuss for my taste.

15:40.400 --> 15:44.720
Now here's the part where this kind of like gets kind of fucking weird.

15:46.240 --> 15:51.680
Janice then writes, here is a dairy farmer friend working on his farm two different days.

15:52.320 --> 15:56.080
One day he looked like a stereotypical farmer in overalls.

15:56.640 --> 16:00.880
And there's a picture of fucking, I don't know how to say this,

16:00.880 --> 16:08.640
other than creep shot of an old man walking in white overalls towards some cows or something.

16:08.640 --> 16:09.280
White overalls?

16:10.240 --> 16:11.440
White overalls?

16:11.440 --> 16:12.080
White.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.000
Is that for milk work?

16:14.000 --> 16:17.680
It's Star Trek rules. You have to dress for the color of your job.

16:18.240 --> 16:23.360
So the first one is just this fucking creep shot of this man walking towards cows.

16:24.080 --> 16:28.400
And then it says the next time I caught him in the barn unloading feed,

16:28.400 --> 16:33.760
he just looked like everyone else. And then there's a picture of a man wearing khakis

16:33.760 --> 16:37.280
and staring at a huge fucking pile of cow food.

16:37.920 --> 16:41.440
And both, by the way, are from behind.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.120
Absolute creep shot.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.160
I sent the link to you guys.

16:44.160 --> 16:44.720
Are you seeing this business?

16:44.720 --> 16:46.480
Yeah, I'm seeing it. It's not great.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.640
It's not great, Janice.

16:48.640 --> 16:53.840
I think probably, this would be like if Sesame Street is like kids today,

16:53.840 --> 16:56.880
I'm going to take you to show how farmers work and every shot is them

16:56.880 --> 17:00.080
fucking hiding in the bushes like, shh, don't be too loud.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.040
They'll know we're here.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.520
Just watch them stare at feed and walk towards cows.

17:03.520 --> 17:10.720
But like, my man in the big food picture is wearing a short sleeve button up, looks like.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.920
And it's so big and baggy.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.520
That's not perfect.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.120
It's not perfect.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.160
That doesn't look perfect.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.560
Sportswear I'm excited by. You mentioned sportswear.

17:20.560 --> 17:24.080
I think sportswear is going to get a lot of the sweat and a lot of the stink out of there.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.400
But what's the-

17:26.400 --> 17:30.160
He is also in a more fashion forward choice.

17:30.160 --> 17:35.760
He's rolled his white coveralls up at the bottom up to above the calf,

17:36.320 --> 17:41.360
which I'm assuming is for various cow liquids that he'll have to sift through throughout the day.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.040
It's very on trend.

17:43.040 --> 17:45.200
It's kind of like a Capri overall.

17:45.200 --> 17:50.240
It does kind of hurt the coveralls because you could just cut them off,

17:50.240 --> 17:54.400
I guess, into sort of a coverall jorts situation.

17:54.400 --> 17:58.000
Well, let's talk about the functional sort of purpose of coveralls.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.760
Because I'll tell you what else covers all.

17:59.760 --> 18:03.920
The jeans and long sleeve shirt I'm currently wearing right now on my body.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.440
I'm fully covered with that.

18:05.440 --> 18:08.800
I don't know why my pants also need to be a vest.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.000
So let's just get that-

18:10.000 --> 18:11.840
Am I afraid of things getting in my pants?

18:11.840 --> 18:14.720
If so, I wouldn't have my calves exposed like this,

18:14.720 --> 18:19.120
so that all the dangerous cow worms, bacteria, whatever get up on them.

18:19.920 --> 18:20.960
This is not perfect.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.360
This is sub-ideal.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.640
It does reduce-

18:24.640 --> 18:27.440
I think it's just so your pants don't fall down, right?

18:28.080 --> 18:30.400
Isn't that for this sort of look,

18:30.400 --> 18:34.080
is just so your pants are sort of like permanently affixed above your shoulders?

18:34.080 --> 18:34.580
Yeah.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.640
So there's another picture on this page of a man wearing coveralls

18:38.640 --> 18:41.280
and he does have a chicken sort of perched on his shoulder.

18:41.920 --> 18:46.880
And I do think that that I hadn't really considered the organic component of your-

18:46.880 --> 18:47.280
Oh yeah.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.720
Like the accessories.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.200
But like if you want to look perfect in a farm,

18:51.200 --> 18:56.000
you gotta have a hen just on you.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.600
Like you just have a hen on you so that you look like you belong there.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.880
That is important.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.320
We gotta combat the sweat.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.880
We gotta combat looking drab and boring.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.640
And you also need to have some sort of living barn element.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.400
I would say what you want is you want a hen on the shoulder

19:14.400 --> 19:16.640
and a collie at your heel, right?

19:16.640 --> 19:18.240
So that way you've got the-

19:18.240 --> 19:21.680
I'm having fun with like the working animals up here,

19:21.680 --> 19:24.560
but I'm working with the fun animals down here.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.560
The animals at the ground are friends.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.360
Yes.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.800
The animals on your shoulder,

19:28.800 --> 19:33.360
if you have a chicken on your shoulder, sort of a far miller, if you will,

19:33.360 --> 19:35.840
that is a more symbolic choice.

19:35.840 --> 19:40.000
I think it's meant to tell something about the person that it's affixed to.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.080
Travis, I gotta say that a hen on my shoulder and collie at my heel

19:44.080 --> 19:50.960
sounds like such a sexist to folksy idiom that is so veiled

19:50.960 --> 19:55.840
you can't really even understand where it is that they're going with it.

19:55.840 --> 19:59.440
Like it's so deeply, so deeply rural.

19:59.440 --> 20:04.240
It feels like if Christians made a line of big Johnson shirts for farmers,

20:04.240 --> 20:05.840
that is the vibe it would be.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.920
Just sort of like we can't have anything racy,

20:07.920 --> 20:11.360
but it just needs to be sort of like right underneath the surface.

20:11.360 --> 20:11.920
Yeah.

20:11.920 --> 20:15.280
Like it would say in big letters, a hen on my shoulder,

20:15.280 --> 20:17.760
collie at my heel, and then like the farmer winking.

20:18.960 --> 20:19.280
Right.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.240
That's good.

20:20.240 --> 20:23.920
There would be a smaller URL at the bottom that you would go to

20:23.920 --> 20:28.640
that would maybe break down what the metaphor was of it.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.840
If you want to find out, you can go here.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.200
He's wearing a t-shirt with a QR code on it.

20:37.440 --> 20:40.240
To have the joke explained to you, scan that.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.760
That's great, and of course, I can't believe we've gone this long without saying it.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.920
And I don't even think you should be allowed on the farm without it.

20:47.920 --> 20:52.560
A long stock of wheat that you're just kind of got hanging out of your mouth.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.400
Yeah, just to test it to make sure it's ready to go to market.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.840
Yeah, I like that.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.120
I haven't seen a farmer do that in real life.

21:01.120 --> 21:08.400
I've only sort of seen like, you know, the mascots for farming-based phone games

21:08.400 --> 21:10.800
always got a long stock of wheat sticking out of their mouth,

21:11.440 --> 21:13.040
and it tastes good, maybe.

21:13.040 --> 21:13.440
I don't know.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.240
Bread tastes good.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.960
That's how to pace your carbs right there.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.040
You can't eat a whole loaf of bread.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.120
Just eat one delicious stock at a time.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.480
Just vape a stock, dude.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.040
Oh, hello.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.240
Didn't see it come in there.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.320
I was just about to give a quiz to my brothers,

21:28.320 --> 21:30.640
but I thought maybe you could play along at home.

21:30.640 --> 21:31.440
You're kidding me.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.200
Do you remember how this bit went last time?

21:35.120 --> 21:37.600
Now, these are all animal questions, fellows.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.640
Oh, fun.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.480
I love that segue.

21:40.480 --> 21:41.360
Oh, thank you.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.080
Now, boys, here's my question for you,

21:44.080 --> 21:46.400
and I invite our listeners to, of course, play along at home.

21:48.000 --> 21:53.680
In proportion to body size, which animal has the largest penis?

21:55.520 --> 21:58.480
Okay, so Juice, maybe it's like last time he did this,

21:58.480 --> 22:00.480
we were like, maybe by the third question,

22:01.040 --> 22:04.320
there'll be like some big payoff for like a funny joke.

22:04.320 --> 22:09.360
Maybe he's playing chess and it's like the third time he does this bit.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.800
So you're saying we power through this one.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.240
This one's going to suck shit.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.240
Everybody at home, listen, this is Griffin,

22:16.240 --> 22:17.760
and I'm going to be real with you.

22:17.760 --> 22:20.320
The next few minutes of the show are going to suck shit,

22:20.320 --> 22:22.480
but the next time Travis does this bit,

22:22.480 --> 22:27.360
the payoff is going to be so decadent and so rich and juicy.

22:27.360 --> 22:30.480
The anticipation, like you guys are going to be so hard

22:30.480 --> 22:32.480
for the third time that Travis does this bit.

22:32.480 --> 22:35.520
But to answer- Hippo. Yeah, a hippopotamus.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.960
A hippopotamus, you say?

22:37.520 --> 22:41.360
No, actually, reaching up to 10 times the length of their body,

22:41.360 --> 22:44.320
the barnacle has the largest penis in proportion-

22:44.320 --> 22:45.760
The barnacle's not really an animal.

22:45.760 --> 22:48.560
It's a rock that gets stuck to ships and it's annoying.

22:48.560 --> 22:51.040
It's a needy rock. It's a needy rock.

22:51.040 --> 22:55.920
Okay. Now, according to the book, does it fart?

22:57.120 --> 23:00.400
What is the only mammal that doesn't fart?

23:00.400 --> 23:02.880
It is worse than I thought it was going to be,

23:02.880 --> 23:04.240
but I will say-

23:07.760 --> 23:08.880
Duckbill platypus.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.080
I'll do hippo again.

23:13.040 --> 23:16.720
Hippo again. No, it is the sloth.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.400
And if things are working normally,

23:20.400 --> 23:22.560
the methane produced by their gut bacteria

23:22.560 --> 23:24.320
is absorbed into their bloodstream

23:24.320 --> 23:26.240
and eventually breathed out.

23:26.800 --> 23:27.360
Cool.

23:27.360 --> 23:30.880
I would like to change my answer to my wife.

23:30.880 --> 23:31.760
Oh, yeah, man.

23:31.760 --> 23:32.640
Oh, okay.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.960
I would like to change Justin's answer to my wife.

23:38.240 --> 23:42.080
Now, if faced with particularly dry air,

23:42.720 --> 23:47.040
the desert snail can hibernate for up to how long?

23:47.680 --> 23:49.840
And this will be the last question for this round.

23:49.840 --> 23:50.480
There's one more.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.520
A year?

23:55.520 --> 23:57.520
There are so many different amounts of time.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.400
There's a lot, yeah.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.400
I can think of like five different amounts of time

24:00.400 --> 24:01.360
just off the top of my head.

24:02.080 --> 24:04.880
I'm going to say they could hibernate for two years.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.320
For three years.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.880
Damn, if we had had one more brother,

24:08.880 --> 24:11.120
he would have fucking gotten it right on the nose, huh?

24:11.920 --> 24:13.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.200
Now, final question.

24:16.720 --> 24:21.040
According to scientists, other than human beings,

24:21.760 --> 24:24.560
what is in, you can name any one of the four,

24:24.560 --> 24:29.120
what are the four other species that go through menopause?

24:29.120 --> 24:34.320
Dogs, cats, owls.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.800
It would be short-finned pilot whales, beluga whales,

24:40.800 --> 24:42.720
narwhals, and killer whales.

24:43.360 --> 24:44.000
Unbelievable.

24:44.000 --> 24:44.640
And humans.

24:44.640 --> 24:45.440
Unbelievable.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.600
What a weird list to be a part of, huh?

24:47.600 --> 24:49.520
That is a strange list to be a part of.

24:49.520 --> 24:50.880
And that was Play It Long at Home.

24:50.880 --> 24:55.440
I hope you all had fun and maybe learned a little something.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.840
Can you at least tell me if it's going somewhere?

24:58.480 --> 25:01.920
And maybe next time we'll answer some questions about,

25:01.920 --> 25:03.760
I don't know, your favorite stories.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.120
Why do you do that, Trout?

25:05.920 --> 25:07.680
Why do I do what, Griffin?

25:07.680 --> 25:09.680
Create little fun ways for people-

25:09.680 --> 25:12.640
It's not even that this segment is like bad.

25:12.640 --> 25:14.480
It's that it's like nothing.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.800
Well, I want people to just have a little moment

25:16.800 --> 25:18.320
for them to feel like they're part of the show.

25:19.280 --> 25:20.000
You know, because-

25:20.000 --> 25:21.520
Okay, you-

25:21.520 --> 25:23.440
I want them to be able to play along at home.

25:23.440 --> 25:26.080
You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding

25:26.080 --> 25:33.040
of like the relationship of observer and like creator.

25:33.040 --> 25:36.640
Well, you know, it's like how Mr. Rogers would often

25:36.640 --> 25:38.640
like just direct address the audience

25:38.640 --> 25:40.160
instead of talking to the other people.

25:40.160 --> 25:42.160
And like, we're always talking to each other.

25:42.160 --> 25:43.840
And I'm saying, where's the part

25:43.840 --> 25:44.320
where we talk to people at home?

25:44.320 --> 25:45.440
But they're not talking to us.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.120
Okay, Travis, what are they saying right now?

25:47.680 --> 25:49.440
They're saying that was a great quiz.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.600
And I learned a little something that was fun for me.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.720
And while I was playing the quiz, I drew a little picture.

25:56.160 --> 25:56.660
So-

25:58.480 --> 25:59.760
You shouldn't have to come up with ways

25:59.760 --> 26:01.680
to entertain yourself during your podcast.

26:01.680 --> 26:02.960
It's not a great look, Travis.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.320
You know, I entertain them

26:04.320 --> 26:06.160
and inspire them to draw a little picture.

26:07.120 --> 26:07.600
Okay, moving on.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.640
It's not because they were bored.

26:08.640 --> 26:09.600
It's because they were inspired.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.280
They had a, they really enjoyed it

26:11.280 --> 26:12.800
and they learned something at home.

26:12.800 --> 26:13.280
What if episode-

26:13.280 --> 26:14.320
Because they played along.

26:14.320 --> 26:21.120
What if episode 500 was just an extended clip of play along at home?

26:21.120 --> 26:23.120
And it was our most interactive episode yet.

26:23.120 --> 26:26.560
It'll be our, whatever it was called, Bandersnatch.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.960
What was the name of the fucking Black Mirror episode?

26:29.520 --> 26:31.360
They'll be our interactive experience.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.720
I think it was Snoochie Boochie.

26:32.720 --> 26:33.920
I think it was Bandicoot.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.680
I have been invited to a nudist party.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.840
It is a totally non-sexual thing.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.120
The clothes don't come off until after we eat.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.560
And I don't know what I should wear.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.280
Should I go over the top or tone it down?

26:47.280 --> 26:47.840
Good question.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.760
That's for mooning in the Midwest.

26:50.640 --> 26:51.140
Okay.

26:51.920 --> 26:55.360
I will grant, and it is fucking every,

26:55.360 --> 26:58.240
it takes everything in me to grant your premise

26:58.240 --> 27:01.680
that this nudist party is a totally non-sexual thing.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.320
It probably is for most.

27:04.320 --> 27:04.820
Right.

27:05.600 --> 27:06.240
Right.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.760
But I'll grant your premise.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.160
They can't do-

27:08.160 --> 27:09.200
Just so we can move on.

27:09.200 --> 27:12.320
They can't take a drop of blood from everybody as they enter

27:12.320 --> 27:16.400
and stick a hot wire into it to see who is the thing.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.120
And by the thing, I mean the secret horny.

27:19.120 --> 27:23.760
Because there's probably one and there's no way of knowing.

27:23.760 --> 27:26.640
I think what we can assume from the non-sexual thing

27:26.640 --> 27:29.680
is that this is not an eyes wide shut sex party.

27:29.680 --> 27:30.480
No, no, yeah, yeah.

27:30.480 --> 27:32.560
People will simply casually be nude.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.400
There's no stigma here.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.560
People want to have a nude party that's not, you know,

27:36.560 --> 27:37.360
that's non-sexual.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.760
It's all about being free, being loose.

27:39.760 --> 27:40.480
I'm into that.

27:40.480 --> 27:47.600
For me, I think my hang up is that the clothes don't come off

27:47.600 --> 27:49.280
until after we eat.

27:49.280 --> 27:50.080
So let's talk about-

27:50.080 --> 27:51.840
That's the last time I want to do that.

27:51.840 --> 27:52.640
Oh, really?

27:52.640 --> 27:52.880
Yeah.

27:52.880 --> 27:53.680
Because I was just-

27:53.680 --> 27:54.800
Huh.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.080
It can be a hot dripping meat situation,

27:58.080 --> 28:02.080
so maybe they don't want to get singes or stains.

28:02.080 --> 28:05.200
A lot of utensils around, I find that intimidating.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.000
Yeah, man.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.280
But I don't-

28:07.280 --> 28:13.440
Although I do like the thing that if a little sauce

28:13.440 --> 28:16.880
should manage to dribble its way off of my chin

28:16.880 --> 28:18.720
and onto my shirt, I can just be like,

28:18.720 --> 28:19.520
oh, the fuck do I care?

28:19.520 --> 28:20.080
Yeah, right?

28:20.080 --> 28:21.120
This thing's coming off.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.800
I might as well throw this in the trash.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.320
What do I care if it's in the trash?

28:24.320 --> 28:28.720
I think it's less about the proximity to eating time

28:28.720 --> 28:34.320
and more that there is a prescribed naked changeover.

28:34.320 --> 28:35.120
Do you know what I mean?

28:35.120 --> 28:35.120
Yes.

28:35.120 --> 28:38.960
There's like this party evolves.

28:38.960 --> 28:44.080
They like jump it up at 7.35 as soon as they're done eating.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.440
I feel like in this scenario,

28:45.440 --> 28:48.160
I would be the guy to lose his nerve and just be like,

28:48.160 --> 28:49.920
I could actually go for another dessert.

28:49.920 --> 28:54.480
Hey, should we order pizza too?

28:54.480 --> 28:56.720
Let's get some za in here.

28:56.720 --> 28:59.600
I'm fucking ravenous still.

28:59.600 --> 29:00.560
You see Randy over there.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.480
He's snarfin' it the fuck down.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.320
Yeah, that's the secret.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.600
That's the horny right there.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.400
So here's the thing.

29:08.400 --> 29:12.160
I get nervous doing something I've never done

29:12.160 --> 29:13.840
and not because I haven't done it before,

29:13.840 --> 29:15.360
but because I don't know the processes.

29:16.240 --> 29:19.840
I can't even imagine the levels that would spike for me

29:19.840 --> 29:20.800
and something like this.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.040
Because for example, I was just sitting here thinking,

29:23.040 --> 29:26.640
when the time comes, do you all get naked in the same room?

29:26.640 --> 29:28.080
Yes, exactly.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.320
Do you go separate places and come back nude?

29:30.320 --> 29:33.920
Okay, if you go to separate places and come back nude,

29:33.920 --> 29:36.640
are you legally prohibited from saying ta-da

29:36.640 --> 29:38.560
when you walk into the room?

29:38.560 --> 29:39.600
Is this a concern?

29:39.600 --> 29:42.480
Do you wanna be the first person there or the last?

29:42.480 --> 29:43.920
Do you wanna find the best seats

29:44.640 --> 29:47.040
or do you wanna come in last and make a show of it?

29:47.920 --> 29:50.080
Here's the one thing I can say concretely.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.600
If you're going to have a successful

29:51.600 --> 29:52.880
non-sexual nudist party,

29:53.760 --> 29:57.040
when everyone walks in, they must be handed a card

29:57.040 --> 29:59.360
and the card has a place for a signature at the bottom

29:59.360 --> 30:01.760
and it says, I, and you write your name in,

30:01.760 --> 30:04.400
do solemnly swear that when it gets to the part

30:04.400 --> 30:07.440
where we all have to bend over and put our clothes back on,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.240
I will not look at anybody's assholes.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.720
Because I think that that would be the,

30:12.720 --> 30:15.440
even if it was like the chillest time,

30:15.440 --> 30:17.120
everybody's like loving it, enjoying it,

30:17.120 --> 30:18.480
there does have to be a point

30:18.480 --> 30:20.800
where everybody picks their clothes up off of the ground

30:20.800 --> 30:22.320
and you will have to bend over.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.000
And that would be the moment where I'd be like,

30:24.000 --> 30:25.600
well, here's my asshole.

30:25.600 --> 30:28.560
I really hope no one, I'm glad we all signed cards

30:28.560 --> 30:30.000
that said no one could look at it.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.800
I have to amend the language, Justin.

30:32.800 --> 30:36.160
It's gotta be, I will try my darndest

30:36.160 --> 30:37.600
not to look at anyone's asshole.

30:37.600 --> 30:40.240
Because I think that there's going to be like

30:40.240 --> 30:43.600
just a second of, oh no, I looked, I'm so sorry,

30:43.600 --> 30:44.720
I broke the code.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.160
And there's gonna be a lot of people

30:46.160 --> 30:49.120
who as soon as you make them sign a promise

30:49.120 --> 30:50.880
that they won't look at anybody's assholes,

30:50.880 --> 30:54.160
they may not have even been planning on scoping no holes,

30:54.160 --> 30:57.120
but as soon as they say they can't, yes.

30:57.120 --> 31:00.240
So let's get back to the actual question though,

31:00.240 --> 31:01.920
because this is a good question.

31:01.920 --> 31:04.320
Do you come in in like a loose fitted,

31:04.320 --> 31:07.840
like almost like a painter's, you know, like bodysuit

31:07.840 --> 31:10.000
that's like one zipper and you're out?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.720
Or is this like, I need many pieces

31:12.720 --> 31:15.280
and I'm going to slowly throughout the course of the meal

31:15.840 --> 31:19.360
remove my gloves and then my jacket

31:19.360 --> 31:22.000
and then the vest and then the ascot.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.160
It's not a burlesque show.

31:24.160 --> 31:25.280
I certainly don't think that's a burlesque show.

31:25.280 --> 31:26.800
But do you want to seem overeager?

31:26.800 --> 31:29.440
I'm worried that the one zipper bodysuit

31:29.440 --> 31:30.880
is like zip zip and it's like,

31:30.880 --> 31:32.800
whoa, look who's already naked.

31:32.800 --> 31:37.040
I feel like the norm at parties like this

31:38.080 --> 31:42.160
is that there is like a zone of nudity

31:42.160 --> 31:46.320
or a zone of doing it if that's the thing, right?

31:46.880 --> 31:52.160
But the idea of it just being a general nude house party,

31:52.720 --> 31:54.080
those have to happen too.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.720
And you can't drive up to the house

31:56.720 --> 31:58.080
and be nude.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.160
You can't get out of your car nude

32:00.160 --> 32:03.600
on the sidewalks that the taxpayers pay for, I don't think.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.160
My guts tells me that what you want

32:06.160 --> 32:09.840
is to cloak whatever it is you're working with.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.400
Like you, I feel like you have to have

32:12.400 --> 32:15.200
the element of surprise somewhat.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.680
Good, bad, indifferent, everybody's beautiful.

32:17.680 --> 32:22.000
I think you do have to have a little bit of like surprise.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.160
This is what I was working with the entire time.

32:24.160 --> 32:25.520
Did you even guess?

32:25.520 --> 32:26.800
Because I bet you didn't.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.760
So are you suggesting like one of those bikini t-shirts

32:29.760 --> 32:32.880
that has a body painted on the front of it?

32:33.440 --> 32:34.640
Is that what you're suggesting?

32:36.160 --> 32:38.080
Yeah, I guess I'm suggesting that

32:38.080 --> 32:42.080
or something loose fitting might be a less sort of wild

32:42.080 --> 32:44.000
assumption to take from what I just said.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.320
Might I recommend maybe along those lines,

32:46.320 --> 32:47.840
cloaking what you're working with,

32:47.840 --> 32:52.400
a late 90s starter jacket with maybe a football team.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.840
Like very puffy, very oversized.

32:55.840 --> 32:56.720
And you look at it and you're like,

32:56.720 --> 32:59.760
oh, I had no idea Doug loved the Steelers so much.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.960
Oh, what's that?

33:00.960 --> 33:02.160
Doug's got a six pack.

33:03.200 --> 33:03.760
Or.

33:03.760 --> 33:04.960
Okay, what about this?

33:04.960 --> 33:08.000
Or he takes it off underneath,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.560
he's got a San Diego Chargers tattoo.

33:10.560 --> 33:11.060
What?

33:11.680 --> 33:12.640
Excuse me?

33:12.640 --> 33:13.680
That must be embarrassing

33:13.680 --> 33:15.520
because they're not even in San Diego anymore.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.160
Yeah, he got it so long ago.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.800
You could also dress it really tight

33:20.800 --> 33:26.320
and then have it sort of unspool as you unzip.

33:26.320 --> 33:27.840
I don't know if that's physically possible

33:27.840 --> 33:29.680
and it would be mighty uncomfortable.

33:29.680 --> 33:34.000
But you know, it's all about the reveal, the prestige.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.360
What about a bunch of balloons?

33:40.320 --> 33:41.120
I don't know, Trav.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.960
You wear a bunch of balloons?

33:42.960 --> 33:43.920
Inside your shirt.

33:44.640 --> 33:45.040
Okay.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.960
So they don't know.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.680
Hey, his body looks like the grapes

33:49.680 --> 33:51.600
from the Fruit of the Loom commercial.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.560
No, no, no.

33:52.560 --> 33:55.200
You take it off, balloons fly up to the ceiling

33:55.200 --> 33:56.480
and there's your nude body.

33:57.120 --> 33:57.620
Cool.

34:00.960 --> 34:01.520
It's good.

34:03.600 --> 34:06.320
Man, I bet this must be a thing of like

34:06.320 --> 34:08.320
after when everyone puts their clothes on

34:08.320 --> 34:09.760
and then you just have a long talk about

34:09.760 --> 34:11.520
who had the best prestige.

34:11.520 --> 34:12.160
Yeah.

34:12.160 --> 34:12.640
Yeah.

34:12.640 --> 34:14.800
Yeah, so.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.600
Well, anyway, that probably answers your question.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.680
We would love to talk more about the subject

34:19.680 --> 34:21.520
that we're imminently qualified to address.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.080
But for the moment, we must adjourn to the Money Zone.

34:36.080 --> 34:36.580
Griffin?

34:37.200 --> 34:37.920
Yeah?

34:37.920 --> 34:39.440
I've been trying to recruit for a while.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.080
I just yelled.

34:40.080 --> 34:40.560
I'm sorry.

34:40.560 --> 34:40.960
I yelled.

34:40.960 --> 34:41.440
I don't know why.

34:42.080 --> 34:42.880
That's okay.

34:42.880 --> 34:43.840
No, it was dramatic.

34:43.840 --> 34:44.640
I liked it.

34:44.640 --> 34:46.720
I've been trying to recruit for a while.

34:46.720 --> 34:47.360
Okay.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.400
And I don't know how to do it.

34:49.280 --> 34:53.280
I'm trying to build, let's say, a defense force.

34:54.880 --> 34:59.760
Like highly skilled agents that I can send on missions.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.600
Right.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.840
To say right what was wrong.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.920
Yeah, I don't know that Zip Recruiter,

35:07.920 --> 35:11.600
I mean, they post lots of job sites, right?

35:11.600 --> 35:13.360
So they may be able to help you put together

35:13.360 --> 35:15.200
a sort of A-Team situation,

35:15.200 --> 35:17.040
if that's what you're suggesting.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.600
I wasn't even thinking A-Team at the time,

35:19.600 --> 35:22.320
but now, yeah, something like that.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.960
I mean, a codable co-founder, Gretchen Huebner,

35:24.960 --> 35:28.000
needed a game artist for her education tech company,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.320
and she went to ziprecruiter.com, posted her job,

35:30.320 --> 35:32.400
and found the right person in less than two weeks

35:32.960 --> 35:35.040
using their powerful matching technology.

35:35.680 --> 35:38.640
So I don't see why you couldn't find a few,

35:39.280 --> 35:42.320
you know, ragtag soldiers of fortune.

35:42.320 --> 35:42.800
Yeah.

35:42.800 --> 35:46.800
Do you think that when Gretchen Huebner hired that person,

35:46.800 --> 35:50.560
Gretchen was like, I need you to do some design stuff,

35:50.560 --> 35:55.680
and also maybe steal some plans for a missile.

35:56.240 --> 35:59.360
Maybe, but there's only one way to find out,

35:59.360 --> 36:02.080
and four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter

36:02.080 --> 36:04.160
get a quality candidate within the first day.

36:04.160 --> 36:06.160
I know that seems like a non sequitur,

36:07.280 --> 36:08.960
but I did need to say it.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.520
It's the smartest way to hire Zip Recruiter is,

36:11.520 --> 36:12.800
and right now Zip Recruiter,

36:12.800 --> 36:14.720
you can try it for free at our web address,

36:14.720 --> 36:17.280
ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

36:17.280 --> 36:21.360
That's ziprecruiter.com slash M-Y-B-R-O-T-H-E-R.

36:22.480 --> 36:27.120
Now Justin, if I was looking for a way to advertise

36:27.120 --> 36:29.360
my team of soldiers of fortune,

36:29.360 --> 36:31.360
who are going around righting wrongs

36:31.360 --> 36:33.440
and stopping bad people.

36:33.440 --> 36:38.640
Travis's extrajudicial sort of action team.

36:38.640 --> 36:39.040
Yes.

36:39.840 --> 36:42.480
Yeah, but because like for a while now,

36:42.480 --> 36:44.320
I've just been writing it out on note cards

36:44.320 --> 36:48.320
and taping it up on like a telephone poles in my area,

36:48.320 --> 36:49.920
but I feel like maybe that's not the best way

36:49.920 --> 36:52.320
to advertise my goods and services

36:52.320 --> 36:54.800
or to promote my physical or online business

36:55.760 --> 36:58.080
or sell products and services of all kind.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.560
Are we calling your extrajudicial action team

37:01.440 --> 37:03.760
a service or a product?

37:03.760 --> 37:06.240
Well, you know, it starts as a service,

37:06.240 --> 37:10.160
but then we can brand and maybe do a little merch.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.120
Oh, that's fun.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.400
Yeah, I love that.

37:12.400 --> 37:15.360
The best place to do all that is gonna be Squarespace.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.680

37:24.880 --> 37:26.880
That's another way of saying phones.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.880
A lot of people have asked.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.280
Analytics, they help you grow in real time

37:31.280 --> 37:33.840

38:01.600 --> 38:02.960
Hey everyone, Alden Ford here

38:02.960 --> 38:04.400
with the cast of Mission to Zix.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.360
Hello.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.760
Our fourth season premieres on February 19th.

38:07.760 --> 38:09.760
And for those of you who aren't familiar with the show,

38:09.760 --> 38:11.440
we decided to ask one of our characters

38:11.440 --> 38:13.920
to give you a quick recap of what's happened so far.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.080
Say hello to the clone trooper, AJ.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.520
Who are you people, what's happening?

38:17.520 --> 38:19.120
Okay, AJ, put your gun down.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.360
AJ, can you just tell us what's happened

38:21.360 --> 38:23.760
in the Zix quadrant in the last couple seasons?

38:23.760 --> 38:25.600
Oh, well, we destroyed the emperor.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.080
Oh, really?

38:26.080 --> 38:26.640
Okay, great.

38:26.640 --> 38:27.920
Yeah, I mean, I think, I think so.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.200
We knocked him into a chasm.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.520
Mr. Robot Man and Bart's ship crashed through a window

38:31.520 --> 38:33.200
and Dar and Baby Horsehead and I took out

38:33.200 --> 38:34.640
like a bunch of bad guys.

38:34.640 --> 38:37.760
Papa filled his destiny and the lizard was there too.

38:37.760 --> 38:38.800
Okay, great.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.280
I guess I was sort of asking what the show is like.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.320
Oh, you mean like it's an improvised serialized

38:44.320 --> 38:46.480
workplace space opera featuring brilliant sound design,

38:46.480 --> 38:47.520
incredible guest stars,

38:47.520 --> 38:50.080
and an epic hilarious tale of fresh versus whack?

38:50.080 --> 38:50.720
Oh, yeah.

38:50.720 --> 38:51.200
Wow.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.400
Where did you come up with that?

38:52.400 --> 38:54.160
Jesse Thorne told me to write that on my palm.

38:54.160 --> 38:54.720
Okay, all right.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.720
Well, Mission to Zix season four debuts

38:56.720 --> 38:58.800
on February 19th on Maximum Fun.

38:58.800 --> 38:59.280
Check it out.

39:02.480 --> 39:04.640
Celebrity wine, why not?

39:05.920 --> 39:07.920
Celebrity wine, why not?

39:07.920 --> 39:08.720
Celebrity wine, why not?

39:08.720 --> 39:10.480
They've got a passion for grapes.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.160
They think beer is for apes.

39:12.160 --> 39:14.160
Celebrity wine, why not?

39:15.440 --> 39:15.760
Good.

39:16.320 --> 39:19.120
So this is Celebrity Wine, Why Not?

39:19.120 --> 39:22.960
It is a sort of a trivia game show

39:24.240 --> 39:27.360
and it's just about celebrities and their passion for wine.

39:27.360 --> 39:30.880
Rather than put you all through incredible challenges

39:30.880 --> 39:36.720
that ask you to pass, ask you to match celebrities

39:36.720 --> 39:40.160
with their wine flavors or vintages,

39:40.160 --> 39:41.600
things that you would have no way of knowing,

39:41.600 --> 39:44.000
I have constructed a five-question quiz

39:44.000 --> 39:44.960
about celebrity wines that I'm going to-

39:44.960 --> 39:46.480
Should people play along at home?

39:46.480 --> 39:47.760
No, I think actually to differentiate-

39:47.760 --> 39:48.480
I would ask if they not.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.560
Yeah, please fucking don't play along at home.

39:50.560 --> 39:51.440
Please don't.

39:51.440 --> 39:52.880
Yeah, because that's mine.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.240
That's Travis's thing.

39:54.240 --> 39:55.680
Here's our first question.

39:55.680 --> 39:58.880
Knocking Point Wines is co-owned with Walla Walla natives

39:58.880 --> 40:02.160
Kevin Zenter and Andrew Harding and this actor.

40:02.160 --> 40:07.120
Multiple choice, Paul Giamatti, Stephen Amell,

40:07.120 --> 40:08.240
Linda Fiorentino.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.880
I feel like Giamatti is so on the nose.

40:14.880 --> 40:15.600
It's a trap.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.960
Yeah, it's a Giamatti trap.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.720
It's a Giamatti snare.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.080
Who was the second one?

40:21.200 --> 40:22.000
Stephen Amell.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.040
Is that Arrow?

40:23.040 --> 40:26.800
Paul Giamatti and Linda Fiorentino.

40:27.680 --> 40:28.640
Those are our three choices.

40:28.640 --> 40:29.520
I'm going with Linda.

40:29.520 --> 40:32.240
I'm going to go with Arrow.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.680
Well, Griffin, you're very smart,

40:35.680 --> 40:38.080
seeing as Knocking Point is the place

40:38.080 --> 40:39.440
where you knock your arrow.

40:40.480 --> 40:41.920
It is, in fact, Stephen Amell.

40:41.920 --> 40:44.080
So he named it that because it's like a cool thing

40:44.080 --> 40:44.800
that his super-

40:44.800 --> 40:45.760
Because it's like an arrow thing.

40:45.760 --> 40:46.800
His badass superhero thing.

40:46.800 --> 40:47.680
Because it's like an arrow thing.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.040
It's kind of like his thing.

40:51.040 --> 40:51.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:51.840 --> 40:52.320
It's like-

40:52.320 --> 40:53.360
Congratulations.

40:53.360 --> 40:58.080
So far the score right now is Griffin won, Travis.

40:58.080 --> 41:01.360
Have you guys ever had Val Kilmer's kick-ass bat wine?

41:03.600 --> 41:06.160
It's super good, and the Joker hates it.

41:08.320 --> 41:10.400
Little Jonathan Winery is a collaboration

41:10.400 --> 41:12.880
between this entertainer and Central Coast winemaker,

41:12.880 --> 41:13.840
Allison Crowe.

41:13.840 --> 41:16.720
They make a Merlot and a Cabernet Sauvignon.

41:16.720 --> 41:17.360
Who runs it?

41:20.320 --> 41:21.200
Give it to me one more time.

41:22.320 --> 41:24.480
Little Jonathan Winery is a collaboration

41:24.480 --> 41:27.840
between this entertainer and Central Coast winemaker,

41:27.840 --> 41:28.800
Allison Crowe.

41:28.800 --> 41:31.120
They make a Merlot and a Cabernet Sauvignon.

41:31.120 --> 41:32.160
Who is the entertainer?

41:32.160 --> 41:33.520
Is it Lil Jon?

41:34.240 --> 41:35.920
It is, in fact, Lil Jon.

41:35.920 --> 41:38.400
Congratulations, Griffin McElroy.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.360
Lil Jon makes a wine called Lil Jon.

41:44.800 --> 41:45.920
Fucking good.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.240
It's actually the funniest thing he could possibly be doing.

41:48.240 --> 41:49.600
Congratulations to you, Lil Jon.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.040
Question three.

41:51.040 --> 41:51.600
There are five.

41:52.160 --> 41:53.600
Right now the score is two to zero.

41:54.160 --> 41:54.480
Okay.

41:54.480 --> 41:57.680
You could say that Chateau Miravelle wine was owned

41:57.680 --> 42:00.800
by Mr. and Mrs. Wine, until time, circumstance,

42:00.800 --> 42:04.320
and dare I say it, fate intervened to make that sub-joke

42:04.320 --> 42:07.680
meaningless at best, and unfeelingly cruel at worse.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.560
Who among us can say why a relationship between two

42:10.560 --> 42:12.640
beautiful, talented, and seemingly generous people

42:12.640 --> 42:13.200
would fall apart?

42:13.200 --> 42:16.320
Perhaps the lesson is that no matter your inner or outer

42:16.320 --> 42:19.280
beauty, relationships are a fickle thing, and not for us

42:19.280 --> 42:21.040
on the outside to take the measure of.

42:21.040 --> 42:23.040
No matter how many people you have,

42:23.040 --> 42:25.840
no matter how many times a couple has been caught

42:25.840 --> 42:27.680
in the twinkle of the paparazzo's lenses,

42:28.480 --> 42:32.400
this year Chateau Miravelle will release a rosé champagne.

42:32.400 --> 42:34.720
That would be Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.

42:35.360 --> 42:36.320
Congratulations, Travis.

42:36.320 --> 42:36.880
Thank you.

42:36.880 --> 42:38.240
Your score rockets to one.

42:38.240 --> 42:40.000
That thing that you just said though,

42:41.600 --> 42:43.200
is that like printed on the bottle?

42:43.200 --> 42:44.720
Because that was a bunch of wild shit.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.800
No, this is the question I wrote to try to cover up the fact

42:48.800 --> 42:50.000
that it was kind of an easy one.

42:50.000 --> 42:50.240
Okay.

42:50.800 --> 42:51.680
Well, don't say that.

42:51.680 --> 42:53.200
It's the first one I got.

42:53.200 --> 42:55.520
You can't be like, Travis got a real gimme.

42:56.960 --> 43:01.520
Hampton Water Wine, a rosé blend, is a collaboration

43:01.520 --> 43:04.560
between Jessie Bongiovanni and this entertainer.

43:05.600 --> 43:09.440
Hampton Water Wine, a rosé blend, is a collaboration

43:09.440 --> 43:23.840
between Jessie Bongiovi and this entertainer.

43:23.840 --> 43:25.680
I'll repeat it one more time.

43:25.680 --> 43:29.280
Hampton Water Wine, a rosé blend, is a collaboration

43:29.280 --> 43:32.480
between Jessie Bongiovi and this entertainer.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.880
Is it Jon Bon Jovi, Justin?

43:36.880 --> 43:38.160
It is Jon Bon Jovi.

43:38.160 --> 43:40.080
Your score's rocking, Travis.

43:40.080 --> 43:44.000
You have blasted off to tie it with Griffin against all odds.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.960
Okay, in my defense, as soon as I started laughing, I got it.

43:46.960 --> 43:48.320
I just couldn't form words.

43:50.560 --> 43:51.200
Oh, fuck.

43:54.560 --> 43:59.920
Venatore is a single vintage Chardonnay based sparkling wine.

43:59.920 --> 44:00.720
Who created it?

44:01.280 --> 44:04.480
Now for this one, there are two hints, okay?

44:04.480 --> 44:08.240
Okay, you can use a hint if you wish.

44:08.240 --> 44:09.280
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.200
Venatore comes from the Latin for hunter.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.800
There's a second hint that you can use.

44:16.800 --> 44:19.040
Is the second hint gonna just completely blow wide open?

44:19.840 --> 44:20.960
I don't actually think so.

44:20.960 --> 44:21.520
All right, give it to me.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.600
But it will be funny for the comedy podcast.

44:25.520 --> 44:27.840
This actor said about his wine,

44:27.840 --> 44:33.760
I'm so proud of this awesome juice I was able to be a part of.

44:37.760 --> 44:38.160
Okay.

44:39.360 --> 44:42.480
Now I will give you a third clue, and this one might break it open.

44:42.480 --> 44:44.960
If Travis misses this one, he will be kicking himself.

44:47.680 --> 44:51.680
Huh, Venatore, a single vintage Chardonnay based sparkling wine.

44:52.400 --> 44:54.560
Venatore comes from the Latin for hunter.

44:54.560 --> 44:57.920
He said about this wine, I'm so proud of this awesome juice

44:57.920 --> 44:59.120
I was able to be a part of.

45:00.000 --> 45:00.960
Ryder Strong.

45:02.640 --> 45:04.720
No, Travis, it's Jared Pilecki.

45:04.720 --> 45:05.220
Damn it!

45:05.920 --> 45:07.280
Of supernatural fame.

45:07.280 --> 45:09.120
That is the sound of you kicking yourself.

45:09.120 --> 45:10.960
I am kicking the shit out of myself.

45:11.680 --> 45:16.960
And he is so proud of this awesome juice he was able to be a part of.

45:16.960 --> 45:17.440
Sorry, Travis.

45:17.440 --> 45:18.640
Pilecki, by the way.

45:19.600 --> 45:22.160
Okay, you've given half a point for the correction.

45:22.160 --> 45:22.800
Travis wins.

45:22.800 --> 45:23.680
Yay!

45:23.680 --> 45:25.760
Celebrity wine, why not?

45:25.760 --> 45:27.920
Congratulations, Travis McElroy.

45:27.920 --> 45:34.800
From nowhere, from nothing, you have risen to take the celebrity wine, why not crown.

45:34.800 --> 45:35.440
That was close.

45:35.440 --> 45:38.240
Celebrity wine, why not?

45:38.240 --> 45:41.040
Celebrity wine, why not?

45:41.040 --> 45:42.800
They've got a passion for grapes.

45:42.800 --> 45:44.480
They think beer is for apes.

45:44.480 --> 45:46.880
Celebrity wine, why not?

45:46.880 --> 45:48.080
That's powerful juice.

45:48.080 --> 45:49.600
That was a powerful fucking segment.

45:50.800 --> 45:51.760
Yeah, thank you.

45:51.760 --> 45:52.080
Thank you.

45:52.080 --> 45:54.000
I was really, I was really proud of it.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.040
Hey, I got a Yahoo here.

45:55.040 --> 45:56.480
It was sent in by a bunch of folks.

45:56.480 --> 46:02.800
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm gonna call Joe Asks.

46:05.040 --> 46:06.480
And we know the answer to this one.

46:07.360 --> 46:08.400
Oh, good.

46:08.400 --> 46:09.520
I like a nice slam dunk.

46:09.520 --> 46:11.680
Yeah, but I think it's worth talking about.

46:11.680 --> 46:12.180
Okay.

46:13.280 --> 46:15.280
If you stink at golf, can you just throw the ball?

46:17.040 --> 46:17.540
Yeah.

46:18.400 --> 46:19.360
Is that against the rules?

46:19.360 --> 46:26.240
Yeah, if you do this at the PGA Masters, the big show, the big beautiful game,

46:27.840 --> 46:32.000
they are going to, you will get, you will be penalized.

46:32.000 --> 46:32.500
Yes.

46:32.960 --> 46:38.560
And I think they do that by, you know, adding strokes to your current score,

46:39.280 --> 46:43.600
or now you don't get to, now you're catty, you don't get a catty anymore,

46:43.600 --> 46:46.080
so you gotta carry the things yourself.

46:46.080 --> 46:46.580
Yeah.

46:46.580 --> 46:48.740
I think it's pretty ridiculous.

46:49.540 --> 46:53.380
I think it's pretty ridiculous and frankly kind of embarrassing to think that

46:53.380 --> 46:57.380
if you're not good at the game, if you're not good at like hitting the ball with clubs,

46:57.380 --> 46:59.940
that you can just pick it up and throw it, right?

46:59.940 --> 47:00.440
Yeah.

47:00.900 --> 47:01.400
Well.

47:01.400 --> 47:08.580
But, but, but what if you could do that?

47:08.580 --> 47:09.700
Well, here's what they don't tell you.

47:09.700 --> 47:13.060
And I learned, I took individual dual sports in high school where they

47:13.060 --> 47:19.540
taught us about golf, and this is a little known, I'll tell you, a little known rule in golf.

47:19.540 --> 47:24.420
You can do it, but once you do it, everyone else gets to do it too.

47:24.420 --> 47:26.980
You break the, it's called breaking the seal.

47:26.980 --> 47:27.480
Correct.

47:27.940 --> 47:32.500
Once you break the seal, everybody, so you gotta watch out for if your opponent can throw things

47:32.500 --> 47:33.540
super far.

47:33.540 --> 47:34.040
Exactly.

47:34.660 --> 47:35.160
Right.

47:35.380 --> 47:39.540
If you think you are the strongest throwing golf person,

47:39.540 --> 47:43.780
and you are the strongest throwing golf person, do it.

47:43.780 --> 47:44.280
Right.

47:44.280 --> 47:50.100
But if you like, I saw, you know, Jenny the other day throw an egg really far,

47:50.100 --> 47:52.420
that probably translates to this.

47:53.140 --> 47:58.420
And it's not just about how far you can eat this golf ball, it's also about the precision game,

47:58.420 --> 47:58.820
right?

47:58.820 --> 48:02.820
It's about your approach and it's about, you know, you go up against somebody who is on the Bozo's

48:02.820 --> 48:03.780
grand prize game.

48:03.780 --> 48:08.260
Mm-hmm. They're gonna be draining buckets left and fucking right.

48:08.260 --> 48:13.300
Um, and maybe you want that, maybe you don't, but I do think that if you stink at golf,

48:13.300 --> 48:15.700
you can just, you should just be able to throw the ball.

48:16.260 --> 48:17.380
You can also kick it.

48:18.420 --> 48:19.380
That I don't like.

48:20.180 --> 48:21.540
You don't like the kicking rule?

48:21.540 --> 48:22.660
No, I don't like that.

48:22.660 --> 48:25.700
Golf ball's not good to kick because it's little, and so it's like easy to miss it,

48:25.700 --> 48:27.540
and it's hard so it can hurt the foot.

48:28.100 --> 48:32.340
But picking it up and throwing it, like, that's got a good hand feel to me.

48:32.340 --> 48:36.340
Like, a golf ball leaving my hand with tremendous force, I like that.

48:37.220 --> 48:38.340
You know what I like?

48:38.340 --> 48:45.060
It's rare to see this, but when, like, a powerful golfer gets up, hits the ball real good with the

48:45.060 --> 48:50.580
club, and it goes a real long way, and then a real pipsqueak gets up there and everyone's like,

48:50.580 --> 48:54.820
well, they don't got it, and they kind of lightly tap the ball, and the ball starts rolling and

48:54.820 --> 48:57.380
everyone's laughing because of how lightly they tapped it.

48:57.380 --> 49:02.500
But then, through a series of, like, it bouncing off stuff and little hills.

49:02.500 --> 49:04.420
Just an organic Rube Goldberg machine.

49:04.420 --> 49:08.100
Right, a bird picks it up thinking it's an egg and realizes it's not an egg.

49:08.100 --> 49:12.580
They get a hole in one, and I like when that happens.

49:12.580 --> 49:14.820
That's basically the Legend of Bagger Vance.

49:14.820 --> 49:16.020
Yeah, yep, yep, yep.

49:16.580 --> 49:21.620
It happens in Bagger Vance, happens in Greatest Game Ever Played, Happy Gilmore,

49:21.620 --> 49:23.700
happens in all the best ones, Caddyshack.

49:23.700 --> 49:25.220
The Shia LaBeouf one.

49:25.220 --> 49:27.540
That's the Greatest Game Ever Played, thank you very much.

49:27.540 --> 49:27.780
Sorry.

49:27.780 --> 49:28.820
I own that on DVD.

49:30.100 --> 49:31.540
What about the- oh, yikes.

49:31.540 --> 49:36.900
What about the thing they do where they use the stick?

49:36.900 --> 49:37.460
Uh-huh.

49:37.460 --> 49:37.940
What is that?

49:37.940 --> 49:38.340
A club.

49:38.340 --> 49:39.060
A club, thank you.

49:39.780 --> 49:44.260
When they use it like a pool cue, I think it's like in Tin Cup or Happy Gilmore, one of those,

49:44.260 --> 49:45.700
like, is that okay?

49:45.700 --> 49:46.340
Is that permitted?

49:46.340 --> 49:46.900
Oh, yeah.

49:46.900 --> 49:51.300
In Tin Cup, he does one drive with a baseball bat.

49:51.300 --> 49:51.700
Yeah.

49:51.700 --> 49:52.980
Certainly, that's not okay, right?

49:52.980 --> 49:54.420
That should be able to use that.

49:54.420 --> 49:56.100
There are no rules in golf.

49:57.300 --> 49:57.780
Oh, wow.

49:58.500 --> 49:59.460
There's probably a few.

50:00.180 --> 50:05.220
I think if you can get up to it, you should be able to throw your opponent's ball backwards.

50:05.220 --> 50:06.260
That is true.

50:06.260 --> 50:09.060
But then it's a sneaking game.

50:09.060 --> 50:11.780
Did you know that if your opponent gets between you and the hole,

50:11.780 --> 50:13.940
you're allowed to drive your ball through their chest?

50:13.940 --> 50:14.820
You can do that.

50:14.820 --> 50:15.860
You can plow right through them.

50:16.740 --> 50:17.780
No, let's stop joking around.

50:17.780 --> 50:20.980
And no court in the world can convict you.

50:20.980 --> 50:22.340
It's international waters.

50:22.340 --> 50:26.420
But no joke, you should be able to pick the ball up and throw it, I feel like.

50:26.420 --> 50:28.260
Especially if you get in the sand.

50:29.460 --> 50:32.580
Like, you know how when you're watching, like, the Masters and they get in the sand,

50:32.580 --> 50:37.460
and then they spend, like, 30 minutes in there, just, like, hitting sand over and over again.

50:38.260 --> 50:40.420
And it's annoying to fucking watch that.

50:40.420 --> 50:43.780
I want to see somebody hit it on the green part, thank you very much.

50:43.780 --> 50:47.140
If my ball gets stuck behind a tree, can I chop the tree down?

50:47.700 --> 50:48.200
Yeah.

50:49.140 --> 50:50.420
Yeah, absolutely.

50:50.420 --> 50:53.700
Yeah, absolutely, but you have to use the tree as your club from that point on.

50:53.700 --> 50:57.220
Now, what if I hit the ball and it lands in someone's sandwich?

50:58.180 --> 50:59.620
Do I need to hit the sandwich?

51:00.180 --> 51:04.580
No, they'll eat around it and then you have your ball good to go.

51:04.580 --> 51:05.780
What if they're a slow eater?

51:06.340 --> 51:10.260
What if it goes in Shrek's swamp and it's like, I don't want to bother that dude.

51:10.260 --> 51:11.940
Like, he's mean.

51:12.660 --> 51:15.060
You could just ask Dunkey to get it back for you.

51:15.060 --> 51:18.020
What if it lands on a big, mean guy's foot?

51:18.020 --> 51:20.180
Like, it did happen in Happy Gilmore.

51:20.180 --> 51:22.420
Yeah, what if it lands on a dog turd?

51:22.420 --> 51:23.700
What if it lands on Poopy?

51:23.700 --> 51:27.300
Like, it happened in the movie and you splatter it and it gets on Bob Barker,

51:27.300 --> 51:29.700
and I'm over here busting my fucking guts up.

51:31.060 --> 51:35.140
Do you guys think we get enough credit for our sports humor?

51:35.140 --> 51:38.820
Because I feel like, I'm sitting here thinking about it,

51:38.820 --> 51:45.700
like, I don't feel like we get enough credit for how good we are with turns of phrase

51:45.700 --> 51:48.740
and different puns just from our wealth of sports knowledge.

51:48.740 --> 51:51.780
Especially considering Griffin sent us this question about three weeks ago

51:51.780 --> 51:53.860
and we've been researching and researching.

51:55.460 --> 51:56.980
It worked in the room, I don't know, man.

51:58.980 --> 52:01.220
Here's another question I have from our listeners.

52:02.020 --> 52:06.580
How can I go big and go home this year?

52:06.580 --> 52:08.340
I don't know that this will work for the program.

52:10.900 --> 52:18.180
I am now of an age, I am 36 years old, I have two children, I still want to party,

52:18.180 --> 52:22.500
but I do want to be done by like 8.30, 8.45.

52:22.500 --> 52:25.700
So this question from boss is, because I don't have a clean read on it,

52:25.700 --> 52:29.220
how can I go big and go home this year?

52:29.220 --> 52:31.140
So both go big and go home.

52:32.660 --> 52:38.100
I mean, I guess we should just say leave early and then sit in silence for seven minutes.

52:38.100 --> 52:40.340
But that's not big, that's just going home.

52:41.300 --> 52:42.420
Where's the big part?

52:42.420 --> 52:44.820
I want to make a big splash and then leave.

52:44.820 --> 52:51.220
Make 2020 the year we stop using doors.

52:51.780 --> 52:53.700
Ooh, okay.

52:55.140 --> 52:56.180
Tell me more about this.

52:56.180 --> 53:00.500
When God opens a window, Boz scuttles through it,

53:01.620 --> 53:04.340
in and out like the cool friend on Clarissa.

53:05.140 --> 53:05.540
Sam.

53:05.540 --> 53:07.220
Only, no, Sam, thank you.

53:08.020 --> 53:10.020
Only windows, no doors.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.380
That is so big.

53:11.380 --> 53:14.420
And then if you do that, if I'm like at a party

53:14.420 --> 53:16.660
and I see somebody open a window and climb through it

53:16.660 --> 53:22.020
and then just fucking bolt, like run away as fast as you possibly can.

53:23.460 --> 53:25.380
Let me think about the other things I'm going to be talking about

53:25.380 --> 53:26.580
at that party for the rest of the night.

53:26.580 --> 53:28.180
Oh, that's right, it's nothing.

53:28.180 --> 53:30.100
Yes, it's nothing.

53:30.100 --> 53:32.180
You're the hit of the party.

53:32.180 --> 53:33.940
And if you can make it out the door to go home,

53:33.940 --> 53:37.380
or make it out the window to go home, no one will see you leave.

53:37.380 --> 53:38.660
They'll assume you were there, they're like,

53:38.660 --> 53:41.860
but I was by the door all night and never saw Boz leave.

53:41.860 --> 53:45.940
You could be in conversation for three minutes at a party,

53:45.940 --> 53:49.300
and then if you at some point turn, run,

53:49.860 --> 53:53.380
and just fucking tiger leap out an open window

53:53.380 --> 53:54.820
to the safe ground below.

53:54.820 --> 53:56.180
It has to be ground level.

53:56.900 --> 53:58.020
This isn't jackass, folks.

53:58.020 --> 53:59.220
You could set up a crash pad.

54:00.020 --> 54:00.520
Yep.

54:01.860 --> 54:04.740
Another good way of doing this is

54:05.300 --> 54:08.260
if it's a place that just has one restroom,

54:08.260 --> 54:12.580
you do the Ace Ventura thing, but before you use it,

54:12.580 --> 54:16.180
where you say like, do not go in there when I'm done with it.

54:16.900 --> 54:21.140
And then you go in and shut the door, and you do lock it,

54:21.140 --> 54:23.700
and then you do climb out the window and go home.

54:24.740 --> 54:27.300
And then people will be like, yeah, that's Boz.

54:28.100 --> 54:31.940
They just like went to the bathroom at this party one time.

54:31.940 --> 54:34.020
They were in there for three and a half hours.

54:34.820 --> 54:36.100
We never saw them again.

54:36.100 --> 54:38.100
We never saw them again.

54:38.100 --> 54:39.940
Here's a different one you could do.

54:39.940 --> 54:43.220
I just want to take that and kind of tickle its belly a little bit.

54:43.220 --> 54:44.580
Make it smile. Make it smile.

54:45.220 --> 54:46.340
Here's the thing.

54:46.340 --> 54:49.460
You walk into a room and say,

54:49.460 --> 54:52.980
woo, do not go in there like Ace Ventura,

54:52.980 --> 54:56.820
but the room you have just walked out of is nowhere near the bathroom.

54:56.820 --> 54:57.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:57.860 --> 55:01.540
So that is one that you could do that people would not see coming.

55:01.540 --> 55:04.420
Justin, can I take that and just tweak it just a little bit?

55:04.420 --> 55:06.020
Turn up the knob just a little bit.

55:06.980 --> 55:07.940
Yeah, yeah. Crank it.

55:07.940 --> 55:09.220
Do that same thing, but-

55:09.220 --> 55:10.580
Hit the nos, baby!

55:10.580 --> 55:13.540
Do that and progressively move from room to room

55:13.540 --> 55:15.780
until you've herded everyone out onto the porch.

55:16.500 --> 55:20.660
And then you leave and maybe put like a big tent up over the house

55:21.300 --> 55:22.580
and say you're fumigating.

55:22.580 --> 55:24.180
This is why this is condemned.

55:28.740 --> 55:31.860
In the 90s, there was a period where every condemned home

55:31.860 --> 55:36.020
had a police officer stationed outside just repeatedly saying,

55:36.020 --> 55:37.140
do not go in there.

55:37.140 --> 55:37.540
Woo.

55:37.540 --> 55:38.340
Woo.

55:38.340 --> 55:40.020
It got a little mechanical eventually.

55:40.020 --> 55:42.660
But hey, that's all the time we have for our podcast.

55:42.660 --> 55:44.420
We hope you enjoyed yourself

55:44.420 --> 55:46.660
and we certainly appreciate you listening to it.

55:46.660 --> 55:50.420
If you are in the Cincinnati area, you should come and see us.

55:50.420 --> 55:52.260
There's still a few tickets left available.

55:52.260 --> 55:55.940
I think if you go to bit.ly forward slash 20 funny,

55:55.940 --> 55:59.540
you can get tickets to see us February 19th at the Taft Theater with Sawbones

55:59.540 --> 56:03.940
or February 20th, we're doing the Adventure Zone at the same venue.

56:03.940 --> 56:08.420
That link again is bit.ly forward slash 20 funny.

56:08.420 --> 56:12.020
Also, so as we mentioned earlier, our 500th episode is coming up

56:12.020 --> 56:14.980
and we wanna hear from people whose questions we have answered

56:14.980 --> 56:18.100
to get updates on how that all turned out.

56:18.100 --> 56:20.660
So if you had a question answered on the show,

56:20.660 --> 56:21.780
not just send in a question,

56:21.780 --> 56:24.180
but actually we like answered it on the show,

56:24.180 --> 56:28.580
email us at mbmbam at maximumfund.org

56:28.580 --> 56:33.220
and put in the subject line 500 app update

56:33.220 --> 56:35.940
and let us know how it turned out.

56:35.940 --> 56:39.700
If you followed our advice or if you didn't, anything like that.

56:39.700 --> 56:40.820
Let us know.

56:40.820 --> 56:43.140
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

56:43.140 --> 56:45.060
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

56:45.060 --> 56:47.380
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

56:47.380 --> 56:51.620
You can just go get that wherever music is sold.

56:51.620 --> 56:55.060
And thank you to maximumfund.org for having us on the network.

56:55.060 --> 56:57.780
Go to maximumfund.org, check out all the great shows.

56:57.780 --> 57:00.980
And while you're there, get ready, get pumped, get psyched

57:00.980 --> 57:02.820
for the Max Fun Drive.

57:02.820 --> 57:03.700
It's coming up soon.

57:03.700 --> 57:05.540
We just recorded our bonus episode.

57:07.140 --> 57:10.740
It's a wild one and you're gonna love it.

57:10.740 --> 57:13.220
And it's a hell of a thing.

57:13.220 --> 57:16.820
And we'll tell you more about that as we get closer.

57:16.820 --> 57:19.220
But until then, hey, how about a final Yahoo?

57:19.220 --> 57:19.780
Do it.

57:19.780 --> 57:20.660
I love that, Griffin.

57:20.660 --> 57:23.620
This final Yahoo was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

57:23.620 --> 57:24.420
Thanks, Adrian.

57:24.420 --> 57:26.340
It's Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

57:26.340 --> 57:29.780
So I'll call this one Sham Asks.

57:34.180 --> 57:36.740
What do you make of Gordon Ramsay?

57:40.180 --> 57:41.380
My name is Justin McElroy.

57:41.380 --> 57:42.740
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:42.740 --> 57:44.260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

57:44.260 --> 57:45.460
This has been my brother, My Brother and Me.

57:45.460 --> 57:46.420
Kiss your dad.

57:46.420 --> 58:05.620
Let's go around the lips.

58:05.620 --> 58:07.220
Maximumfun.org.

58:07.220 --> 58:08.580
Comedy and culture.

58:08.580 --> 58:09.780
Artists owned.

58:09.780 --> 58:10.820
Audience supported.

58:12.420 --> 58:15.940
Hey, I'm Jared Hill, co-host of the brand new Maximum Fun podcast,

58:15.940 --> 58:16.660
Fantai.

58:16.660 --> 58:18.260
And I'm Travelle Anderson.

58:18.260 --> 58:20.340
I'm the other more fabulous co-host.

58:20.340 --> 58:22.180
And the reason you really should be tuning in.

58:22.180 --> 58:23.540
I feel the nausea rising.

58:23.540 --> 58:26.660
To be Fantai is to be a big fan of something,

58:26.660 --> 58:30.980
but also have some challenging or anti-feelings toward it.

58:30.980 --> 58:32.100
Kind of like Kanye.

58:32.100 --> 58:33.620
We're all fans of Kanye.

58:33.620 --> 58:35.620
He's a musical genius, but like, you know.

58:35.620 --> 58:36.820
He thinks slavery is a choice.

58:36.820 --> 58:38.580
Or like the Real Housewives of Atlanta.

58:38.580 --> 58:40.660
Like, I love the drama, but do I want to see black women

58:40.660 --> 58:41.620
fighting each other on screen?

58:41.620 --> 58:47.860
We're tackling all of those complex and complicated

58:47.860 --> 58:50.500
conversations about the people, places, and things that we love.

58:50.500 --> 58:53.060
Even though they may not love us back.

58:53.060 --> 58:53.860
Fantai.

58:53.860 --> 58:54.820
Maximum Fun.

58:54.820 --> 59:12.260
Podcast, meow.
