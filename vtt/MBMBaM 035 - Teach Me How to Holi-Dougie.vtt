00:00.000 --> 00:10.880
Hello, friends. This is Griffin. You're about to listen to my brother, my brother, and me's

00:10.880 --> 00:17.880
heretofore untitled holiday special. As we promised, it is relatively free of cursing

00:17.880 --> 00:23.280
if you want to listen to it with your family, except for, oh, I don't know, the first minute

00:23.280 --> 00:30.160
or so features a song that is full of quite a bit of cursing. So just a heads up, if you're

00:30.160 --> 00:36.920
watching this with Mama and Papa and Lil Bro and Big Bro and Sissy and Unky Dan around

00:36.920 --> 00:41.440
the fireplace and you don't want to hear any curse words, you may want to skip forward

00:41.440 --> 00:57.000
by about a minute, starting right now.

00:57.000 --> 01:15.320
Fuck you if you don't like goodwill to men. Fuck you if you don't like presents in the

01:15.320 --> 01:35.000
giving. Fuck you if you don't like yams from a can, and fuck you if you don't like honey

01:35.000 --> 01:48.480
from a can. Fuck you if you don't like Christmas. Fuck you if you don't like Christmas. Fuck

01:48.480 --> 01:52.080
you if you don't like Christmas.

01:52.080 --> 02:01.160
Ho ho ho. That's it? That's what you're bringing? That's your super original? That's my Christmas

02:01.160 --> 02:10.240
heat is to say ho ho ho at the beginning. As true today as it was in Santa Claus's day.

02:10.240 --> 02:17.200
My original thought had been to say ho ho holidays. That's the worst, Justin. Oh my

02:17.200 --> 02:22.200
god. Pretty good, right? Were you struck in the head with something? Let me try again.

02:22.200 --> 02:27.600
I'll just start over. Let's just fire off like nine or ten different. Born unto us this

02:27.600 --> 02:34.640
day is a child named Wisdom. Born unto the star of knowledge and enlightenment, while

02:34.640 --> 02:38.920
a three wise men named Justin, Travis, and Griffin. Okay, now that's a vein that we

02:38.920 --> 02:45.780
can tap into. Yeah, definitely. Make the three wise men more of a focal point. The three

02:45.780 --> 02:54.000
wise men were the true sinner of the first Christmas. Every 25th of December we get together

02:54.000 --> 02:59.480
and celebrate three wise men appearing unto Jesus. So there's there's gold, there's

02:59.480 --> 03:04.040
frankincense and there's myrrh. Which one of us like which which which gift would each

03:04.040 --> 03:07.960
of us have brought? Because I think I would have brought the frankincense. Yeah, I think

03:07.960 --> 03:12.160
I would have done myrrh because I'm on a budget. But see, gold seems a little too gaudy for

03:12.160 --> 03:18.920
Justin. Me? Yeah, no, I would. No, I was back then. Could it be could it be frankincense,

03:18.920 --> 03:23.680
myrrh and Pokemon cards? Justin and I would probably both bring myrrh because we didn't

03:23.680 --> 03:28.880
talk about it beforehand. Yeah, I would bring gold because I would be super into my Joey

03:28.880 --> 03:33.760
but a Foucault face. Yeah, I just have chains and stuff. That was me back then. That was

03:33.760 --> 03:39.000
a long time. It was literally approximately 2000 years ago. Not approximately, Griffin.

03:39.000 --> 03:47.880
We know exactly how long ago it was. 2009 years and 360 days is how long ago. So this

03:47.880 --> 03:52.880
is my brother, my brother and me teach me how to holoduggy. This is an advice show for

03:52.880 --> 03:56.920
the modern era. There has to be a better name for it than that. I don't think there is.

03:56.920 --> 04:00.960
The only other one I could come up with was teach me how to snuggie. But I feel like that's

04:00.960 --> 04:05.600
right in that same vein. Griffin, you're talking to a man whose best intro was ho ho holidays.

04:05.600 --> 04:09.480
I'm not going to be able to come up with a better name. I don't know. I appreciate the

04:09.480 --> 04:13.400
candor of your terrible, your terrible holiday reference. So what about. It was called the

04:13.400 --> 04:22.040
episode Christmas time. What about this time? A holiday snowdown. A holiday snowdown. Sure.

04:22.040 --> 04:26.480
This is, like I said, the advice show for the modern era where three actual brothers.

04:26.480 --> 04:32.480
My name is Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy and I'm Griffin McElroy. And we're trying

04:32.480 --> 04:38.000
our darndest and you'll know, you know, it's true because I said darndest to do a holiday

04:38.000 --> 04:46.540
show, a family holiday show appropriate for all ages. And so this is going to shake out

04:46.540 --> 04:51.280
one of two ways. If you're listening with family members, either you are going to share

04:51.280 --> 04:57.240
a really nice 50 or so minutes or you're going to share a nice twenty five minutes followed

04:57.240 --> 05:04.160
by twenty five minutes of awkward silence. Now, we kind of we kind of screwed that up

05:04.160 --> 05:08.640
with our intro song. But really, I feel like it was so delightful and light hearted that

05:08.640 --> 05:18.000
that profanity, you know, it wasn't it wasn't vulgar. No. Using the FCC's, you know, regulations

05:18.000 --> 05:24.360
for. OK. Yeah, I had forgotten about that. So sorry already, I guess. That's our buddy

05:24.360 --> 05:31.680
Drew Toothpaste. His name is not Drew Toothpaste. His name is Drew. He makes ToothpasteforDinner.com

05:31.680 --> 05:37.920
a delightful web comic. You should go buy his merch and you should follow him on Twitter.

05:37.920 --> 05:42.560
He's at Drew Toothpaste. And maybe just say, like, hey, thanks. Thanks for the license.

05:42.560 --> 05:47.280
Thanks for letting the brothers use your tune. I'm a big fan fan for life. I'm your biggest

05:47.280 --> 05:52.640
fan now. Yeah. Just turn swim fan on him. Yeah, that's good. Go full swim fan. Follow

05:52.640 --> 05:58.200
him around. Leave leave dead sparrows in front of his car. Yeah. See, I'm a big fan of your

05:58.200 --> 06:04.460
show and he'll be like, what show? And then disappear like a ninja. Hey, so let's get

06:04.460 --> 06:10.520
into the questions. Let's dip in. What's the best way to introduce your significant other

06:10.520 --> 06:16.480
to your drunken family at the family holiday dinner or party? Happy holidays from Mary

06:16.480 --> 06:24.800
in Manhattan. And that's M-E-R-R-Y. Love it. Love it. This seems ideal to me. This seems

06:24.800 --> 06:30.280
like it cuts down on a lot of the pressure that you undergo when when introducing a significant

06:30.280 --> 06:35.640
other to a group of people. It's like pressure free because every first off, they're only

06:35.640 --> 06:40.920
sort of going to remember it. Yeah. There's like a built in reset button. Yeah. That's

06:40.920 --> 06:44.400
a double edged sword, though, because your significant other next time they see your

06:44.400 --> 06:49.840
family members, if your family members are like, oh, hey, I could hurt her feelings or

06:49.840 --> 06:56.600
his. There's no greater gift than the next social engagement you're at. You know, you're

06:56.600 --> 07:00.480
going to have a leg up because the person will remember you. That is true. Puts them

07:00.480 --> 07:05.880
on the defensive. That's a priceless form of social currency. Sometimes when I introduce

07:05.880 --> 07:11.680
myself to people, I say, oh, hi, I'm Grisha. And then then I got all the power. I hold

07:11.680 --> 07:18.960
all the cards in that situation. And that's what that's what the holidays are all about,

07:18.960 --> 07:26.080
holding all the cards. Yeah. Especially if you're playing Skippo. Skippo. Holiday Skippo.

07:26.080 --> 07:31.320
You got a whole family together. The cable's out. You got there's wassle, a big pot of

07:31.320 --> 07:35.920
wassle and you and you don't know what to do. Well, why not? Why not Skippo? That's

07:35.920 --> 07:40.720
a freebie. Skippo for the holidays. That's a free one. That's a new slogan. That one's

07:40.720 --> 07:52.480
for you, Skippo company. Thanks for the money, suckers. I think that you, you know, you say,

07:52.480 --> 07:59.080
hey, this is Deborah. Let her into your heart like you let Jesus into your heart two thousand

07:59.080 --> 08:05.240
nine years and three hundred sixty days ago. Yeah, I would say unless your family is like

08:05.240 --> 08:12.400
belligerently drunk, it's not any different than introducing them to them at any other

08:12.400 --> 08:18.360
time. Now, if your family is belligerently drunk, might I suggest not? No, screw that

08:18.360 --> 08:23.520
noise. Might I suggest drinking contests with your new like proof, prove her or himself

08:23.520 --> 08:28.560
to them? Oh, I like that. Or maybe you just show up to the party with like a whole cart

08:28.560 --> 08:32.920
and a three buck chuck. Like, hey, guys, you're south right now. I'm going to take you to

08:32.920 --> 08:40.080
a full on blackout town. Let's go to blackout town for the holidays. I love it. And yeah,

08:40.080 --> 08:48.000
this is a good time to introduce new loves in your life because it is because strangers

08:48.000 --> 08:51.800
are almost like to be expected. Yeah, it's the only time where I think it wouldn't be

08:51.800 --> 08:57.240
weird. Yeah, but there's I mean, especially extended family because you don't know them

08:57.240 --> 09:02.080
that well. Maybe that's why. I mean, the ceremony of the holidays, there's so much ceremony

09:02.080 --> 09:05.160
and everybody's ceremonies are different. That's kind of what we're talking about today

09:05.160 --> 09:11.880
is people's, you know, what they do for Christmas, what's their normal, their normal style. And

09:11.880 --> 09:14.840
when you introduce new elements into that, I don't know, I think it can be weird for

09:14.840 --> 09:21.440
them. But but it sounds like this person's tradition is drinking heavily, which I think

09:21.440 --> 09:26.800
most people can get down with. The most important thing for you to do is to explain to your

09:26.800 --> 09:33.760
significant other what they should be prepared for. Because really, like, I think the concern

09:33.760 --> 09:40.000
here is not your family accepting them. So much as it is your family is drunk at a family

09:40.000 --> 09:45.480
holiday party. And you're bringing your significant other there. And they are getting introduced

09:45.480 --> 09:51.040
for the first time. So just make sure that they are prepped and ready to go for you know,

09:51.040 --> 09:57.200
your drunk uncle, your drunkle hanging out on the table. Yeah, you don't miss a trick

09:57.200 --> 10:03.080
do you? Nope. You just can't help yourself. I love it. Let's move on. What are some some

10:03.080 --> 10:08.480
cheap gifts for Hanukkah I can get for my friends without seeming cheap? I am in college

10:08.480 --> 10:15.520
and super poor. Any advice? Kara. Kara, sweetie. You done missed it. What about Bible? You

10:15.520 --> 10:21.360
done fell off. Travis, are you suggesting that she convert to Christianity and that

10:21.360 --> 10:28.160
be her Christmas present or her Hanukkah present? No, I'm suggesting she convert other people.

10:28.160 --> 10:33.000
She be a force. She be a force to win souls to Jesus. Is that what you're saying to me?

10:33.000 --> 10:42.000
No, of course not. That's bigoted. Happy holidays. I'm changing your religion. Man,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.800
every Hanukkah is winding down. You're like, boy, this has been fun, but wouldn't it be

10:45.800 --> 10:51.560
great to celebrate again? That's when you need to make the switch. Keep it going. Folks,

10:51.560 --> 10:55.360
if you're gonna switch from Judaism to Christianity, you have to do it. You've got to do it like

10:55.360 --> 11:03.300
December 19th? Yeah, like right around there. And then surprise. I think you should, whatever

11:03.300 --> 11:06.680
you get, you should go to your friends and say, I'm sorry I got you terrible Hanukkah

11:06.680 --> 11:12.320
gifts. I asked three Baptists what I should get you. And they said I should convert. Did

11:12.320 --> 11:18.880
not come through. It did not play like how I thought it would. I used to think that nobody

11:18.880 --> 11:25.240
could do this successfully. I used to think if you do not have money around Christmas

11:25.240 --> 11:31.920
or Hanukkah, you're just effed. There's nothing you can do there. But lately, I don't know.

11:31.920 --> 11:37.640
I've seen some people actually make some really nice things for other people. Scarf. Knit a

11:37.640 --> 11:44.240
scarf. Yeah, scarf, a nice scarf, a nice shawl. Never underestimate making dinner for your

11:44.240 --> 11:49.960
friends. You know what I mean? It's a big group present. It'll cost you like 20 bucks

11:49.960 --> 11:55.600
to cover everyone. And if they're poor too, they'll probably appreciate the food more

11:55.600 --> 12:00.800
than they would appreciate a lighter or something. I don't know. What do you get people on Hanukkah?

12:00.800 --> 12:05.000
No, that's good. That's good because I think college is an appropriate age where you don't

12:05.000 --> 12:12.800
have to worry so much about killing it with actual tangible gifts. Actual shows of affection

12:12.800 --> 12:19.720
are just as appreciated. You know that old saying, it's a thought that counts? Yeah.

12:19.720 --> 12:24.320
I like to extrapolate that to its logical conclusion and give people gifts that they

12:24.320 --> 12:29.200
won't let me give them to it. Try this. When Christmas time rolls around, tell them you

12:29.200 --> 12:34.360
got them two months of maid service and then they'll be like, wow, that sounds really nice.

12:34.360 --> 12:39.200
And then on the first day, show up in like an apron with a duster and just look really

12:39.200 --> 12:43.480
sad and start cleaning their floor. There's no way they're going to let you do it. Now,

12:43.480 --> 12:48.880
let's dissect that. What thought went into that other than like diabolical? Like the

12:48.880 --> 12:51.800
thought was, the thought was I'm going to get you two months of maid service and I'll

12:51.800 --> 12:57.320
do it myself. And the best gifts are the ones you make. Right? That's a thought. So turning

12:57.320 --> 13:01.480
yourself. So it's implying that your house is really dirty. Yeah. Turning yourself into

13:01.480 --> 13:06.680
an indentured service servant is. Yeah. The thought I had is that you might like their

13:06.680 --> 13:12.160
house to be cleaner. That's creepy. I don't like that. It's not like a do anything. It's

13:12.160 --> 13:16.000
not like those dirty maids that you hear about. Yeah. Not a dirty maid service. It's like

13:16.000 --> 13:22.280
a regular maid service. Still, still. Oh, another great gift. Dirty maid service. Yeah.

13:22.280 --> 13:26.400
If that's available in your area. It's major metropolitan right now, but I think it's really,

13:26.400 --> 13:30.920
I read in a Reader's Digest. It's really spread. Reader's Digest. Really? That's right. That's

13:30.920 --> 13:36.800
where I read about it. Someone took an advert. Oh, another great cheap gift. Reader's Digest.

13:36.800 --> 13:40.960
They're like three, three bucks a pop. They're at every doctor's office. Just get them from

13:40.960 --> 13:48.640
a doctor's office. It's free. Hey, it looks like you can't handle a real magazine. Here's

13:48.640 --> 13:53.640
this little guy. The thought was I was going to read a bunch of magazines and, and cut

13:53.640 --> 13:57.020
out the best parts and tape them together for you, but instead I let these people do

13:57.020 --> 14:03.000
it for you and I stole this from a doctor's office. My crazy aunt has made a list of things

14:03.000 --> 14:07.900
she wants from her relatives for Christmas. She even made my grandmom, her mom, buy a

14:07.900 --> 14:13.400
pot she wants and told her to get the money for it from me for Christmas. That's a lot

14:13.400 --> 14:18.360
of stuff. What do I do? What? That's a lot. I don't, I'm not even sure I understand the,

14:18.360 --> 14:25.480
the inset this for me today. Her crazy aunt has a Christmas list, right? Like a list of

14:25.480 --> 14:32.080
things she wants for Christmas. She made her grandmother by which the question askers mom

14:32.080 --> 14:38.080
buy a pot until he gets the money. Okay. So the person asking the question gave her mom

14:38.080 --> 14:44.320
money to buy a pot for her aunt for Christmas. Not an ordeal. I don't see the ordeal here.

14:44.320 --> 14:49.760
I think the issue here is the specificity of the list and like to the point where it

14:49.760 --> 14:56.480
is less a, a list of suggestions and more like the aunt said, that's the pot I want.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.720
Buy it now and then just get the money from her later. I think it goes deeper than that.

14:59.720 --> 15:04.520
I think she's saying, I want the question asker. Let's just, can we just call her like

15:04.520 --> 15:11.320
Deborah, Deborah, Deborah. I want Deborah to get me a pot Christmas, Deborah. That seems

15:11.320 --> 15:17.760
almost like that, like fetishist. Like, yeah. My Christmas will be ruined unless Christmas

15:17.760 --> 15:23.180
Deborah gets me that pot. Just go ahead and get it now before it's sold out. Get it now.

15:23.180 --> 15:28.280
Get it now. Get it today. She has to buy it at 946. Now I have had holidays ruined because

15:28.280 --> 15:34.640
people didn't bring me the pot they promised that I can sympathize with. But like if she

15:34.640 --> 15:40.240
gets the pot from, from Deborah's Papa, like, yeah. Is she going to freak out at that point?

15:40.240 --> 15:45.680
Like if my dad gave me pot, I would freak out. Yeah, absolutely. Well, this leads I

15:45.680 --> 15:52.040
think to a good discussion about lists. Um, lists such a holiday conundrum. Yeah. On the

15:52.040 --> 15:58.160
one hand, it's kind of, it's kind of like a kidnapper. You're making really specific

15:58.160 --> 16:04.280
demands and like you put things on there specifically so certain people will get them for you. But

16:04.280 --> 16:09.800
then there's without a list, it's a complete crap shoot. Oh, it's a, yeah, it's rough accent

16:09.800 --> 16:20.200
on the crap. Yeah. I have so many things now. The sliver of things that I want of like material

16:20.200 --> 16:25.920
possessions that I would value is so small. Yeah. Like I'm going to, I'm a, I'm a white

16:25.920 --> 16:32.520
American in my, in my early thirties. Like I have a, well late twenties technically.

16:32.520 --> 16:39.680
It's like very late twenties. I have the latest twilight years, twilight years in my twenties.

16:39.680 --> 16:48.120
And uh, I have most of the things that I would need. Yeah. Including twilight. Yeah. Um,

16:48.120 --> 16:52.880
here's the thing though. Papa McElroy and I agreed that Christmas time is a test. It's

16:52.880 --> 16:57.320
a time to like prove how much you love someone by how well you know them, by what gifts you

16:57.320 --> 17:01.600
can get them. Yeah, that's it. It's not, it's not how much you get them. It's it, you're

17:01.600 --> 17:06.680
absolutely right. It's how well do you know me? Yeah. Like if you guys get me cookware,

17:06.680 --> 17:11.360
it's like actually I could actually use some cookware. That's a bad thought. So yeah, yeah,

17:11.360 --> 17:17.000
it's a moving target. That's the problem. Um, I think I, this is, this is one area that

17:17.000 --> 17:20.800
I excel at. I don't, I don't want to toot my own horn, but I think I'm, I'm pretty good

17:20.800 --> 17:26.440
at identifying what a person wants and needs and filling that desire with my, with my,

17:26.440 --> 17:31.200
with my dollars. I'm pretty good with knowing what girls want and girls need, but, but as

17:31.200 --> 17:36.400
far as just regular people, whatever, whatever makes them happy, sets them free. Absolutely.

17:36.400 --> 17:43.280
I can't believe I knew the second verse, the second line. Yeah. That's my Christmas gift

17:43.280 --> 17:47.200
to you is that knowledge, that realization. Um, remember that on Christmas day because

17:47.200 --> 17:52.480
you're not going to get as much as everybody else. Uh, I think this is a classic question,

17:52.480 --> 17:56.240
but what do I get my boyfriend's parents for Christmas? We've been together for almost two

17:56.240 --> 18:00.240
years now and I've actually spent more time at his parents' house in the last two years

18:00.240 --> 18:04.960
than at my own. I'm in grad school and he lives much closer. I want to get them something

18:04.960 --> 18:09.120
that says, thank you for letting me sleep in your son's bed without judging me too much,

18:09.120 --> 18:15.600
but not high. I'd like to be your new daughter. Thanks. Confused at Christmas time. Fine line.

18:15.600 --> 18:22.640
Got to walk that line. Got to walk it. Um, have you considered a card? Uh, like just

18:22.640 --> 18:26.280
a nice card. Maybe you can make it yourself that says, thank you for letting me sleep

18:26.280 --> 18:31.840
in your son's bed without judging me too much. Hmm. Hmm. A little literal for my taste. Yeah.

18:31.840 --> 18:36.560
I mean it's Christmas time. Cut out the middleman. Sure. That's in a mentality. If you've been

18:36.560 --> 18:40.920
with this dude for two years, why are you afraid of a gift that says, hi, I would like

18:40.920 --> 18:45.400
to be your new daughter. Don't you want to be? Yeah. Let's not bring it down. Let's not

18:45.400 --> 18:49.960
bring a Christmas show down by talking about how this person has commitment issues. But

18:49.960 --> 18:54.280
what I'm saying is what I'm saying is you sleep at their house. You spent more time

18:54.280 --> 18:59.360
at their house than at your own. Maybe it's time to accept the fact that you probably

18:59.360 --> 19:04.720
don't need to worry about what you get them for Christmas. Well, you should actually reverse

19:04.720 --> 19:10.440
of that have to worry more and more each year. It expounds. Expounds. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah,

19:10.440 --> 19:16.640
yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh man, I miss the boat. Can I, can I, I think a lot of times people,

19:16.640 --> 19:22.360
um, you think too much about who you are relative to the gift you're getting and I don't think

19:22.360 --> 19:26.880
that matters to people so much. I think if you think about them as, as people, just as

19:26.880 --> 19:32.240
the person and, and what that person might like, um, then, then I don't think you send

19:32.240 --> 19:37.600
me, like the only time I think you send messages with a gift is if it's like a ring or a key

19:37.600 --> 19:42.400
or something like, I don't think people read into it that much. Maybe that's just me. No,

19:42.400 --> 19:46.600
you're completely right. Frame photos. Stay away from frame photos. Yeah, it does the

19:46.600 --> 19:54.520
same thing. Here's the thing. If you are having trouble, uh, identifying your, you know, potential,

19:54.520 --> 19:59.080
what is that parents in law? Yeah, your parents in law, like your potential parents in law,

19:59.080 --> 20:02.160
what they, what kind of people they are, what they might want. Maybe that's a sign that,

20:02.160 --> 20:04.920
you know, maybe you should spend some more time with them and get to know them a little

20:04.920 --> 20:09.640
bit better. That's a great present. That's a great present. Or, I mean, it sets you up

20:09.640 --> 20:15.000
for ease of use for future, you know, gift buying things like you, you, ideally you would

20:15.000 --> 20:19.760
know them as well as you know your own parents and you would know what to get them. What

20:19.760 --> 20:25.000
I would suggest is everybody has like that main thing that people think about when it

20:25.000 --> 20:28.420
comes to getting gifts for them. Like, oh, he really likes dogs. So I'll get him something

20:28.420 --> 20:34.080
dog themed. You want to go for the second level that less people know, but they still

20:34.080 --> 20:40.200
really enjoy and then get them something non-specific theme to that. So it's like, I know you well

20:40.200 --> 20:45.480
enough that I know you like this thing, but you know, it's, I don't want to be your new

20:45.480 --> 20:48.720
daughter. That can really bite you in the ass though. If it's like, I know you like

20:48.720 --> 20:53.960
books. So here's a, you know, here's a Barnes and Noble gift card who don't, I don't think

20:53.960 --> 20:59.840
it's for, for parents, potential parents-in-law. I don't know. That seems, you know, you can

20:59.840 --> 21:06.300
go more specific than that. I brought Barnes and Noble. Yeah. I brought you to Barnes and

21:06.300 --> 21:11.320
Noble to pick out whatever you want. Get in the car. It's Christmas. I, I, um, I, I'd

21:11.320 --> 21:15.600
like to let you guys in on a little, a little Justin McElroy jam, a little secret from me

21:15.600 --> 21:20.720
to you. If you're spending a lot of time at their house, get them, get them something

21:20.720 --> 21:24.640
that they can keep at their house. It's going to make your life a little better. A couple

21:24.640 --> 21:29.000
of years back, I got my in-laws the surround sound system. They like it. I love it. Cause

21:29.000 --> 21:36.200
I'm there all the time watching movies, uh, uh, getting, getting a real sensory experience

21:36.200 --> 21:40.440
that I got them. Nothing says happy holidays like something that's going to make you happy

21:40.440 --> 21:46.960
too. If you want more specific for the dad, get the new Mark Twain autobiography and for

21:46.960 --> 21:50.800
the mom get a Snuggie. It's a gift everybody wants, but nobody will buy themselves. Yeah.

21:50.800 --> 21:56.560
I was going to say a roller skates, roller skates, roller skating lessons. Okay. Good.

21:56.560 --> 22:02.200
Couples activity, couples activity. I like it. Strengthen their marriage and embarrass

22:02.200 --> 22:07.080
them, embarrass them on the street. Cause let's be honest, they weren't in roller skates.

22:07.080 --> 22:14.200
Matching sweatsuits, matching tracksuits. I love it. That's a slam dunk. Hey guys. Oh,

22:14.200 --> 22:18.840
you know what? Griffin, do you have any, um, give me Yahoo. I do have a Yahoo. I only have

22:18.840 --> 22:22.000
a couple that are holiday themes. So I'm going to save those for maybe a little bit later

22:22.000 --> 22:27.280
in the show. Um, let's do this one instead. This one was sent in by Bridget. Thank you,

22:27.280 --> 22:33.800
Bridget. Okay. It's by Yahoo answers user. Jesse, who asks, why do I feel like I am a

22:33.800 --> 22:43.400
car for some reason? I have an obsession where I know I am a car. Mostly a Mercedes Benz

22:43.400 --> 22:49.000
or BMW. Like I will be running and stop all of the sudden while doing my tire brake sound

22:49.000 --> 22:54.840
effect and act like I am slamming on my brakes on the interstate. I also like to make the

22:54.840 --> 23:02.680
BMW face while taking off really fast and doing the sound waves. Wait, what? Is it normal

23:02.680 --> 23:09.720
that I feel like I am truly born a car like a BMW or a Mercedes? Is it normal? No. Hello.

23:09.720 --> 23:14.960
It's not normal. It's opposite of normal. Here's a good, here's a good like normal acid

23:14.960 --> 23:20.360
test. If anyone ever has ever said anything like what you're saying, it's normal, but

23:20.360 --> 23:26.760
that, that is not your case. Like you're the only person. Why is a BMW face? You don't

23:26.760 --> 23:31.560
know? No. I'm making it right now. Let's see if you can tell like a difference in my, my

23:31.560 --> 23:37.920
vocality. Okay. Yeah, guys, I'm just raking about BMW face now. All it does, it kind of,

23:37.920 --> 23:42.640
it shits my mouth. It sounds classier I think. Yeah. Should I make it for the rest of the

23:42.640 --> 23:47.680
show? More streamlined. Okay. I have a question for you. What would be less creepy? This,

23:47.680 --> 23:54.200
this person who says, I know I am a car or someone who wrote in saying, I like to pretend

23:54.200 --> 23:59.880
that I'm a car. Like I would always prefer they have the commitment to being a car that

23:59.880 --> 24:05.040
like, like this person does. I know I am a car. I mean, what, what could possibly lead

24:05.040 --> 24:10.160
to this is obviously some sort of deep, deep delusion that he's been cultivating for years.

24:10.160 --> 24:15.080
What could possibly, what was the seed? What was the inception that really got in his noggin

24:15.080 --> 24:20.320
and planted this, this idea in his head? Is it what he watched turbo team and he saw a

24:20.320 --> 24:27.480
turbo team, something hot and change into a car. That's me obscure 1980s cartoon stuff.

24:27.480 --> 24:34.080
Okay. Then you already know. Okay. It sounds like you cracked this case or he's turbo team.

24:34.080 --> 24:39.640
Eat some hot and he turned into a car. That sounds like something hot, like spicy. Yes.

24:39.640 --> 24:44.840
Or he get or he get hot. Like he just got high. He turned into a car turbo team. That's

24:44.840 --> 24:49.320
the crappiest superpower. Yeah. That's not awkward. What happens if you're on like a

24:49.320 --> 24:53.700
first date, but you're at like a, an Indian restaurant and you eat some, you know, uh,

24:53.700 --> 24:58.680
some chicken tandoori with a little in it. And like you, you, what about when you get

24:58.680 --> 25:02.640
into like later on the evening, you get into that heavy petting and all of a sudden she's

25:02.640 --> 25:10.720
got a handful of Chrome. More importantly, she's crushed to death underneath your car

25:10.720 --> 25:16.120
that you are. The sauna is another weird one cause you're just there with a bunch of naked

25:16.120 --> 25:19.880
guys and all of a sudden there's a car in a towel and they crushed all of them cause

25:19.880 --> 25:27.640
it's not a big sauna. Um, so I have to know more about this question that I, are there

25:27.640 --> 25:32.920
answers like there are too. Let's this one is by a Yahoo answers user. Come on people

25:32.920 --> 25:37.420
who says it's completely normal. What's not normal is how you think you're a Mercedes

25:37.420 --> 25:45.000
Benz or a BMW. Just face it. You're a Chevy like the rest of us. Uh, Yahoo answers user,

25:45.000 --> 25:51.880
uh, nightwish responded. I'd rather eat worms than drive a Chevy. Be a man, drive a Ford.

25:51.880 --> 25:58.080
And this is what it devolves into. Meanwhile Yahoo answers user Mitch Chase says you sir

25:58.080 --> 26:05.960
are a complete lunatic. There. Thank you. We got back around to it. That's a, my brother,

26:05.960 --> 26:10.240
my brother and me listener. Yeah. Yeah. Going through Yahoo answers and found this question

26:10.240 --> 26:17.040
and answered, Hey, you're crazy balls. Oh man. Is there a more perfect symbol for the

26:17.040 --> 26:21.800
internet? The one human being says, I am a car and another one says, I like different

26:21.800 --> 26:26.120
cards. Like what? What are you? I didn't you hear the first thing, the thing that just

26:26.120 --> 26:31.400
happened. If you guys were cars, uh, or you know what? So let's open it up. Any form of

26:31.400 --> 26:38.000
motorized, uh, uh, locomotion, what would you, what do you think you'd go with? If I

26:38.000 --> 26:42.120
was a farmer, do buggy Travis, really? Yeah. I don't get that. You don't seem like you're

26:42.120 --> 26:48.160
a big fan of the dunes. No, I just want to be a dude buggy. They're awesome. Okay. Is

26:48.160 --> 26:52.000
this like a, what will be? Yeah. It's like a, it's like a psychological like association

26:52.000 --> 26:57.200
test. Like what, what are you? What, what attribute derailed train? Ooh, that's, that's

26:57.200 --> 27:07.480
pretty poetic. Travis. Thank you. Justin. Yeah. Anything? Me? Uh, I'd be a, uh, a hearse

27:07.480 --> 27:14.680
that used to be a hearse, but then somebody turned it into a pizza wagon. I like it. Or

27:14.680 --> 27:21.960
maybe a segue, maybe a segue. No, that's good. Where do you want to order? Where do you want

27:21.960 --> 27:27.080
to order from? We can do Domino's. We can do pizza hut. Yeah. That would be really upsetting

27:27.080 --> 27:29.920
because you get so excited for your pizza to show up. Like, you know how, like when

27:29.920 --> 27:33.280
you see the pizza wagon roll up, I guess the most exciting moment of your life. Why do

27:33.280 --> 27:38.440
you always order from pizza funeral? That's my least favorite place. The pizza graveyard

27:38.440 --> 27:42.760
is my least, and you always want to order from there. Although their corpse crust is

27:42.760 --> 27:50.680
just really out of this world. I would of course be a G six or like a G six. Yeah. Um,

27:50.680 --> 27:55.600
I think I'm G six like the way that I like to fly so high. Hey guys, my sister-in-law

27:55.600 --> 27:59.400
is pregnant. Not only does she want to put one of her sonogram pictures on her Christmas

27:59.400 --> 28:06.520
card this year, she wants to Photoshop a little Santa hat on her unborn child. Yes. Yes. Yes

28:06.520 --> 28:12.440
is she does. How do we politely explain to her that this is the worst idea ever? You

28:12.440 --> 28:19.400
don't do that. You don't do a thing. In fact, I would suggest like a series of these doing

28:19.400 --> 28:24.440
different things, like a little cowboy hat. Maybe he's playing a little flute, a little

28:24.440 --> 28:31.320
pan flute in there. Yeah. I like that. Ask her to make it, um, good for a bunch of different

28:31.320 --> 28:35.280
religions and like Photoshop a little Yamaka on him and put happy Hanukkah. Cause that

28:35.280 --> 28:40.080
would be adorable. I mean, it depends on how far along he is, right? Like if he's still

28:40.080 --> 28:46.200
like just a little, a little zygote, uh, I do not think that, that, that particular form

28:46.200 --> 28:50.360
of human being is capable of doing many things. Although I don't think you could capture that

28:50.360 --> 28:54.920
in a sonogram that might be a little. And if it is a zygote, um, an inappropriate response

28:54.920 --> 29:01.820
is to go, not too late. And that that's like, don't don't do that. Like, uh, will, will

29:01.820 --> 29:08.960
Santa visit you in the womb to say, well, yeah, it's just a tight fit. There's, there's

29:08.960 --> 29:14.200
some, uh, you don't read that Christmas story very frequently. It's, it's, it's pretty

29:14.200 --> 29:18.300
apocryphal, but yeah, they, they, I mean, he can get down in there. What's the chimney

29:18.300 --> 29:22.560
like? What is he? Does he turn it on? You like, doesn't go the way you expect and like

29:22.560 --> 29:29.020
does the nose. Is that your, it's your, it's your butt. It's your, Santa's a little kind

29:29.020 --> 29:33.960
of on the, it's a little literal. Santa just, he's not a creative man. That's why it's not

29:33.960 --> 29:38.480
the most popular Christmas story ever. It's not the best story ever told. It's not, it's

29:38.480 --> 29:43.440
the most upsetting story. Listen, you're going to have to be pretending that you, uh, really

29:43.440 --> 29:47.680
can't get enough of this kid for years to come. You might as well start now. You might

29:47.680 --> 29:53.200
as well just keep it, keep it to yourself. I watched Die Hard every Christmas Eve and

29:53.200 --> 29:57.840
have done so over the past decade or so. It's been a longstanding tradition after one year

29:57.840 --> 30:02.080
when it was the only remotely Christmas related movie my had on, not watched by Christmas

30:02.080 --> 30:06.400
Eve. What? Okay. Uh, nothing gets me more pumped for a special day than watching Bruce

30:06.400 --> 30:10.640
Willis kill German thieves. Would you consider Die Hard a Christmas movie? And is this tradition

30:10.640 --> 30:16.360
as awesome as I think it is? Or is it just plain weird? Simply, uh, sincerely McClain

30:16.360 --> 30:23.600
at Merrymas. Yes. Yes. What is awesome. It's awesome. I do this too. And of course Die

30:23.600 --> 30:27.780
Hard is a Christmas movie. It's the best Christmas movie. I mean, it's, it's a, it's a Christmas

30:27.780 --> 30:33.040
movie in the same vein that, uh, Home Alone is a Christmas movie or, uh, uh, Love Actually

30:33.040 --> 30:37.640
is a Christmas movie. Like they aren't, they aren't, uh, you know, mired in Christmas themes,

30:37.640 --> 30:42.460
but they do take place at Christmas and they get me Christmas Eve feeling down deep, down

30:42.460 --> 30:47.300
deep in my gut where your heart used to be. Doesn't Bruce Willis at one point kill a

30:47.300 --> 30:52.200
dude and put a Santa hat on him. Yeah. There it is. There's your link, ho ho ho. I got

30:52.200 --> 30:57.000
a machine gun. Christmas ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho holidays. That's the way she does it.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.680
Ho ho ho holidays. I have a machine gun. Hey, it's, uh, the Christmas traditions are by

31:01.680 --> 31:06.780
and large, whatever you attach value to. Um, and if you have like, you know, if that gives

31:06.780 --> 31:11.500
you that traditional feeling, that Christmassy nostalgic feeling to watch Die Hard with your

31:11.500 --> 31:18.000
It's it's totally appropriate and not weird at all. Hey, do you guys want to try and guess my favorite line from Die Hard?

31:19.380 --> 31:22.500
Tell me oh my god, the quarterback is toast

31:26.060 --> 31:31.980
That might be my favorite line in any my favorite sentence ever spoken I like I like the old classic

31:33.020 --> 31:35.020
Give me Ki-A buddy

31:35.020 --> 31:39.980
That's what you Christmas that one. We go grab weasel lover mother plucker

31:44.180 --> 31:49.940
People start crushing harder on others my fear theories that the cold weather increases the like factor

31:49.940 --> 31:54.420
Am I crazy for this holiday like theory or do you find it true as well Griffin?

31:56.060 --> 31:57.740
What I

31:57.740 --> 32:02.920
Have some that sentence going on this or do you find this true as well Griffin? No, I guess no he has a point

32:02.920 --> 32:05.700
I'm the only single person. I'm the only batch left on the show, right?

32:05.700 --> 32:12.060
So I I got I hope I'm the only one who's still crushing unless you guys crush on your your wife and girlfriend respectively

32:12.700 --> 32:18.220
Yeah, it's very romantic. I'm we're required to yeah. Yeah, it is. Yeah, that's a thing

32:19.220 --> 32:24.540
It is right it is it's because it's because like you're so lonely right? You're so oh man

32:24.940 --> 32:28.380
How lonely is it today? Let me check the barometer

32:28.380 --> 32:33.820
Super super lonely and like it's cold outside, which sucks

32:33.820 --> 32:37.340
So you want to be with someone in a cuddle position?

32:38.020 --> 32:44.500
And also like it's Christmas and like you don't have any presents like none. You have zero presidents

32:45.700 --> 32:51.660
Yeah. Yeah, that's a totally a thing. It's not it's not a like factor. It's a I don't know. It's a

32:52.220 --> 32:54.340
quiet snowy desperation

32:54.340 --> 32:58.940
Mm-hmm. That is my favorite self Jan Stevens album

32:58.940 --> 33:06.180
Oh quiet snowy desperation. The funny thing is is you can put like a time limit on these relationships and they'll go from about

33:07.140 --> 33:13.600
November 20th to February 15th. Yeah, it's groundhog day. That's actually why groundhog day was invented

33:15.540 --> 33:19.220
An idea of how much longer this this is gonna go on

33:19.220 --> 33:21.220
Oh

33:22.500 --> 33:26.620
To spring training soon as spring training starts for that's a baseball

33:27.380 --> 33:28.740
reference

33:28.740 --> 33:32.200
And then I usually I know it's about quitting. It's closing time

33:33.500 --> 33:35.500
But she absolutely cannot stay here

33:36.660 --> 33:41.720
It's weird though, cuz it's like I've lived this day 20 times and I keep having to break up with you on it

33:42.820 --> 33:46.820
Like I don't know what to do here. I'm pretty sure I need to get out of the relationship

33:46.820 --> 33:49.420
Maybe I should learn to play piano. That is this room?

33:50.180 --> 33:52.180
Hey guys

33:52.340 --> 33:56.620
I'm driving with my best friend who's like my brother from NYC to Ohio for Christmas

33:57.040 --> 34:00.580
Normally other people are there so I just sit in the back and read with my iPod on

34:01.020 --> 34:04.500
Since it will just be he and I I'll have to interact

34:04.640 --> 34:12.340
What are some fun things the brothers McElroy do on long car rides road trip in Gmail? Good question

34:12.340 --> 34:17.700
I did this yesterday. Did you but you're yeah with Evan our buddy Evan Minsker friend of the show

34:19.020 --> 34:23.140
Kind I this is gonna sound like a joke, but this is why I I

34:24.100 --> 34:26.900
this year I started listening to podcasts and

34:27.860 --> 34:31.300
You know, it also happened to be the year that I started doing a podcast

34:31.300 --> 34:37.920
but like seriously it saved my life because I used to live in in this kind of crummy suburb of

34:37.920 --> 34:44.480
Cincinnati where there wasn't anything to do and it was 30 minute drive to do to get to Cincinnati to do anything and so

34:44.480 --> 34:50.680
I started listening to to podcasts and seriously like there's no better way. It is turned my my

34:51.520 --> 34:55.480
Driving experience, you know into an absolute treat

34:56.320 --> 35:01.620
Good shared activity. Yeah. Yeah, the best thing about podcasts is they take care of the talking for you

35:01.760 --> 35:05.560
So like, you know, you're gonna run out of things to talk about on like a 12-hour drive

35:05.560 --> 35:09.120
Yeah, even if it's with the first hour you pop on your podcast

35:09.120 --> 35:13.720
You're good for like another nine hours, even if it's with your best like Evans my best friend

35:13.720 --> 35:17.160
Like, you know, it's there's still a lot of conversation to do

35:18.080 --> 35:23.200
So so you take the burden off both people and listen to a funny podcast. It's good to have

35:23.920 --> 35:25.920
Sorry go on. No, it's good to have that

35:26.960 --> 35:30.220
In the back like absolutely as a as a backup plan

35:32.040 --> 35:34.040
You should you should have

35:34.040 --> 35:39.040
Some in there to to mix up your repertoire when the conversation slows

35:39.040 --> 35:43.720
I also really like like stand-up comedy CDs. Yes. He's on a sorry is

35:44.600 --> 35:50.080
One of my favorite road trip CDs to listen to sure. I mean that used to be my jam. I think that

35:50.800 --> 35:52.920
Podcasts have replaced that that need for me though

35:53.720 --> 35:56.640
Yeah, most of my things revolve around that like books on tape

35:57.720 --> 36:02.020
Podcasts stand-up comedy. It's all pretty much someone else doing the talking for me

36:02.020 --> 36:03.140
I

36:03.140 --> 36:05.140
some games

36:05.380 --> 36:07.580
There's always spot the car. It's fun

36:08.580 --> 36:10.580
Spot the letter we like to do that one

36:11.200 --> 36:16.060
We used to play a game called ghost which we would do that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we play

36:23.540 --> 36:29.060
Ghost is a game where you take turns. God. This is like the narrative do it. This game is so fun. I

36:29.060 --> 36:33.180
Actually, yeah, it's a good holiday game, too. Yeah, you get you take turns

36:35.380 --> 36:42.860
Each person gives a letter in sequence you go in in order and each person gives a letter and the idea is to work towards

36:42.860 --> 36:44.580
spelling a word

36:44.580 --> 36:46.780
but the first person to actually spell a word

36:47.460 --> 36:49.460
or

36:50.100 --> 36:52.340
To use a letter that could not be

36:53.060 --> 36:55.060
used in a in the word

36:55.060 --> 36:59.500
Is is out or penalized? So let's let actually you know what?

36:59.500 --> 37:03.580
Let's do a holiday. All right order of age descending. Okay

37:04.660 --> 37:05.940
s

37:05.940 --> 37:07.940
t oh

37:12.540 --> 37:14.540
See

37:16.620 --> 37:17.700
Yeah

37:17.700 --> 37:21.780
So at this point Travis has the option of saying K and spelling stock

37:21.780 --> 37:29.180
yeah, which will we will he will lose or trying to play it off like he knows another word that starts with steer

37:29.180 --> 37:35.420
Let's see Travis is also sitting in front of his computer. It's a whole new level the ghost now. I'm gonna say K

37:35.660 --> 37:41.680
What's in this game over? Yeah, necessarily the funniest bit we've ever done, but I feel like not a classic

37:42.340 --> 37:45.020
Ambient being moment. It's not gonna make the tape but the mixtape

37:45.020 --> 37:52.060
Dad's gonna love a present cuz I can play that game at any time of day. There are probably nerds shouting at their radios

37:52.060 --> 37:54.060
Right now like he should have said age

37:54.060 --> 37:55.220
stanching

37:55.220 --> 37:57.220
stanching

37:58.060 --> 38:00.460
There are other road games you play you play hide the carrot

38:04.100 --> 38:06.400
There's a will he notice

38:06.400 --> 38:13.360
A great game the Badger's Secret

38:16.880 --> 38:18.880
Victorian part of parlor game

38:18.920 --> 38:26.960
One of these is poisoned. Oh, yeah, you start clap every claps and they say the Badger's Secret is that I'm okay

38:27.680 --> 38:31.360
I've gone to two Christmas parties for the past three days where I

38:31.360 --> 38:36.320
suggested that we play that game I couldn't think of the name of it like the game from the Albert Finney version of the

38:36.320 --> 38:40.000
Christmas carol and people looked at me like I was a madman and

38:40.440 --> 38:44.000
Adonami that like not everybody has seen the Albert Finney version of a Christmas carol

38:44.080 --> 38:47.120
To be fair Griffin if you had said let's play the minister's cat

38:47.120 --> 38:53.640
They still would have looked at you weird that is right. The minister's cat is a lonely kept the minister's something cat. Hey Griffin

38:54.480 --> 38:59.680
Downstairs, I got that. I got that DVD as soon as we're done with this. Let's just watch that fire it up

38:59.680 --> 39:01.680
if

39:01.680 --> 39:06.920
It's just fun like that. That's some people haven't screwed what Scrooge track it down

39:08.120 --> 39:15.920
My husband's family has a Christmas morning tradition of putting the baby Jesus into the crib in the antivity and the whole family sings

39:15.920 --> 39:17.920
Happy birthday to Jesus. Oh

39:18.760 --> 39:24.000
No, I think this is strange. My husband grew up with this tradition. So he thinks it's normal

39:24.000 --> 39:30.840
Could you guys clear things up and tell us is it weird? Uh, man, this is so

39:31.920 --> 39:33.920
half and half I

39:34.400 --> 39:35.760
think

39:35.760 --> 39:41.640
That like I almost feel like we've done this once like but like as a goof because who would do that?

39:41.680 --> 39:46.480
Here's the thing if you were singing to the actual baby Jesus in a crib

39:46.480 --> 39:50.620
My that's the thing my hang up with this isn't that they're singing happy birthday to Jesus

39:50.620 --> 39:54.720
Is that they're singing happy birthday to a tiny little baby Jesus statuette

39:54.720 --> 39:58.400
I'm against singing to inanimate objects in any form

39:58.400 --> 40:03.000
But aren't we supposed to imagine that he's like floating above them and like approvingly

40:03.440 --> 40:05.440
Clapping his hands along or nodding or whatever

40:06.880 --> 40:14.520
Heavens but to say it to a little clay figurine is we yeah, that's that's idolatry dog. That's that's number one. Oh, that is true

40:14.520 --> 40:20.840
I here's what you do Christmas. They start singing you pick up the nativity and smash it on the ground

40:20.840 --> 40:27.340
You yell, I tell us and then you know false. God you very very like forcefully try and drag each of them to the oven

40:29.680 --> 40:31.680
Jack and a Bendigo style

40:32.280 --> 40:34.680
Keep it down Shadrach. I'll take you to the oven

40:37.120 --> 40:39.940
This is a George Foreman grill you can

40:41.080 --> 40:43.080
Do you very slowly?

40:43.080 --> 40:45.080
Put half of your hand in here

40:45.620 --> 40:47.460
a

40:47.460 --> 40:52.280
Friend of mine recently told me she's planning on getting gifts for me and a few of her friends for Christmas

40:52.280 --> 40:55.600
I told her getting friends gifts wasn't a thing

40:55.600 --> 41:00.240
We usually did and she said she just had some ideas in mind and really gets to shop for guys

41:00.240 --> 41:02.480
And she isn't expecting or wanting something return

41:02.820 --> 41:08.500
Should I run out and get something and tell our friends what she's planning or just let her give gifts as she pleases?

41:08.500 --> 41:14.580
Stumped in suburbia. Oh god. This is so tough. Wow. This is something

41:16.180 --> 41:19.020
It's the unspoken contract of gift-giving

41:19.560 --> 41:26.540
You don't have to give someone a gift just because they gave you one but you're gonna feel like a douche if you don't

41:27.220 --> 41:29.220
This is why you should have

41:29.300 --> 41:34.340
You've got this is a warning for everybody. You've got to have some backup gifts

41:34.340 --> 41:39.700
Oh, yeah, just some random wrap like like a Snuggie everybody wants one

41:39.980 --> 41:45.320
Put like a bottle of wine in the back of your car and oh sure cheese tray something like that

41:45.360 --> 41:50.700
But then you get your gift here. What if like your five your five-year-old nephew gives you a gift?

41:50.700 --> 41:56.980
You can't be like hey son. Here's he gets the Snuggie some yeah, I guess but I mean if all you have is wine

41:56.980 --> 42:04.780
Oh, yeah, I was making like it like you get this great juice. I like to have a ten of dance butter cookies. Oh, yeah

42:04.780 --> 42:07.140
Say here eat these baby

42:10.060 --> 42:15.460
Receive one of those bonus presents and like, you know, you know, of course, you know

42:16.660 --> 42:18.660
To answer your actual question

42:19.220 --> 42:22.320
The impetus is not on you to fix this. Yeah, like

42:22.320 --> 42:28.640
Gifts are nice. It's nice to get gifts and you know, if your friend's gonna do something that might mean people uncomfortable

42:29.440 --> 42:30.640
you

42:30.640 --> 42:35.760
Are are not gonna be able to fix this situation because then think about this combination you have to have

42:35.760 --> 42:38.400
Hey, you should get Angela a gift like that

42:38.400 --> 42:44.440
It's bossy and nosy and you have the you have advanced nose though. You don't have an excuse

42:44.540 --> 42:46.540
You have to get her again

42:46.540 --> 42:53.580
That you like it. That's not an option for you. Um, you know, what else is good scarves. That's a good multi-purpose

42:53.580 --> 42:55.460
I believe it's gift ours

42:55.460 --> 43:01.660
It's cool. No scarves scarves like it like like Garfield does lasagna scarves

43:03.700 --> 43:05.220
Scarves

43:05.220 --> 43:11.820
This is a good object lesson not for our listeners stumped in suburbia, but for the type of people that he's talking about

43:12.700 --> 43:14.420
don't get

43:14.420 --> 43:18.100
Random people presents. It's it's really nice and everything like that

43:18.100 --> 43:23.740
But you're gonna sideswipe them and come out of nowhere and and then you're not gonna get anything in exchange

43:24.460 --> 43:26.740
Yeah, and I'm not saying that's the point

43:26.740 --> 43:31.140
But it will make the other person feel uncomfortable because they don't have anything for you

43:31.420 --> 43:35.780
Unless you get them a Snuggie and then they there will be they will feel comfortable for the all of their yes

43:36.500 --> 43:41.280
How about a Yahoo answer tell me this one was sent in by Maddie B. Thank you Maddie B

43:41.420 --> 43:43.420
It's by Yahoo answers user raw

43:43.420 --> 43:45.420
Who asks?

43:46.300 --> 43:50.300
Would your parents explain sex if you put it in your Christmas wish list

43:55.460 --> 43:57.300
Well, there's there's additional details

43:57.300 --> 44:03.420
But I feel like we need to address the first question first would your parents explain sex if you put it in your Christmas wish list

44:04.180 --> 44:06.180
It sounds like he's asking

44:06.180 --> 44:13.760
His parents never explained sex. Uh-huh. He's requesting on his Christmas list that

44:14.280 --> 44:17.040
They learn about sex that they do the birds and the bees talks

44:17.880 --> 44:20.680
See, this is another good reason not to have lists

44:21.360 --> 44:24.680
Because you can put some crazy crazy stuff like that in it. Yeah, I

44:26.040 --> 44:31.920
Mean that seems like a pretty important present if they yeah skipped out on that that I don't know about you guys

44:31.920 --> 44:33.920
I received a series of lectures

44:33.920 --> 44:38.600
Yeah, I think it's funny that he has to outsmart his parents about it. Like oh

44:39.120 --> 44:44.880
You got me. All right. I guess you gotta have the talk now. You did put it on your list good call

44:45.960 --> 44:50.560
Because is this question asker wanting this information? Like are they in need of this?

44:50.760 --> 44:55.740
Like they know how to ask Yahoo. Let me to ask their parents. Let me bust out the additional details

44:56.360 --> 44:58.000
Okay

44:58.000 --> 45:00.160
I'm 20 and still awful at it. Oh

45:00.160 --> 45:03.320
Oh, no now that now

45:04.400 --> 45:09.360
We just broke through the crust into the creepy creepy mantle of this question

45:11.180 --> 45:14.720
Wow, so you are wanting sex tips

45:15.560 --> 45:21.120
No, you wanna you want you want to go to your mom and dad and say hey mom and dad teach me how to dougie

45:22.480 --> 45:25.160
I mean he is saying something like that

45:26.040 --> 45:28.480
I'm still terrible at it. I need mom and dad

45:28.480 --> 45:34.680
To teach a daddy. Um, daddy my daddy. I love you. Happy Christmas. Happy Christmas, Papa

45:35.680 --> 45:37.680
Do you enjoy your bowling ball?

45:38.320 --> 45:40.000

45:40.000 --> 45:45.960
I'm trying to rearrange some guts and I could I could use some pro tips daddy

45:45.960 --> 45:54.960
Yeah, uh, uh, happy birthday, uh, Jesus

45:59.480 --> 46:01.480
And everything but

46:02.000 --> 46:10.160
I'm getting laughed at over here. I'm getting some I'm getting some coital giggles that I could really do without so

46:10.160 --> 46:15.680
If you have like a strategy guide that I could crack the spine of

46:17.720 --> 46:25.420
Hey daddy after Rudolph, could you jot me down some charts and maybe some diagrams just jot me out like a Venn diagram of

46:26.880 --> 46:32.020
What to do and where to do it. Yeah, how to do it how you do

46:32.960 --> 46:37.320
Hey, but but listen if your wife's pregnant stay away from the butt cuz that's Santa's town. That's

46:37.320 --> 46:39.680
It's not get out of there. I see

It or tonight you're blocking ho ho's exit and like he needs to he's got

46:46.800 --> 46:49.960
You can't stay in your wife's uterus all night, please

46:50.960 --> 46:53.280
Please let's say that man. Let's sit out

46:54.160 --> 47:00.680
We hope everyone had the foresight who was listening to this their family just skip that clip to head that question off at the past

47:01.200 --> 47:02.720
Yep

47:02.720 --> 47:04.920
Let's just slow it on now. Um, I

47:04.920 --> 47:09.200
I need an idea for a new holiday tradition for me and my husband

47:09.200 --> 47:15.460
This is our first Christmas as a married couple. Also, we're really non-traditional. So go crazy brothers. We're looking

47:16.760 --> 47:23.320
Sorry, so go crazy brothers. We're looking for fun. Thanks in need of holiday cheer gmail. This is awesome

47:23.320 --> 47:29.720
I've been doing this so so much up in Chicago because I don't know too many people up in there except for my two roommates

47:29.720 --> 47:35.020
Um, and we've had to make our own we've had to make our own, you know

47:35.760 --> 47:40.200
Holiday experiences didn't follow through on a lot of them though, but we had some good ideas

47:42.000 --> 47:48.520
Well, why don't you not don't keep us in we almost we almost went to the zoo, okay

47:50.800 --> 47:52.800
That's how was your Christmas

47:54.760 --> 47:56.760
Almost went to the zoo

47:56.760 --> 48:01.120
I'm pretty good. We are Christmas Eve tradition or is

48:01.960 --> 48:03.960

48:12.040 --> 48:13.360
And

We've been doing that for literally two decades every every Christmas Eve will go

48:18.680 --> 48:23.040
We'll take a walk. Charles isn't gonna be in this year. We think we're gonna have to have him on speaker phone

48:23.040 --> 48:27.600
Skype him. Yeah, we'll Skype him in but he can't he has to promise he's walking in the cold

48:27.800 --> 48:31.720
It's a that's a pretty dumb tradition because wow, it is cold

48:31.720 --> 48:38.000
It's so cold, but it's not we talked about what happened during the year and year in review type thing

48:39.200 --> 48:44.680
That's that's the nice thing about any holiday tradition or any tradition to begin with it really can be

48:45.400 --> 48:48.200
Anything you just have to say like let's do this every year

48:48.200 --> 48:54.320
Your tradition can be to eat hot dogs and watch Rambo every year. And that's your own

48:56.600 --> 49:02.240
Me and my roommate watched we were we were going to watch all of the extended Lord of the Rings movies

49:02.240 --> 49:04.240
But we only made it through about one and a half

49:07.040 --> 49:09.480
So maybe your tradition is falling through

49:09.480 --> 49:18.040
Yeah, it beat me to it, uh-huh so there's that what about I I'll tell you I

49:18.560 --> 49:23.400
Some of my favorite holiday traditions center on baking I was gonna say baking. Yeah, that's always good

49:23.400 --> 49:28.360
Let me give a quick recipe. Okay, get it third cup of butter 40 big marshmallows

49:28.440 --> 49:32.080
Heat them up on low till they're melted teaspoon of green food coloring

49:32.480 --> 49:38.400
Then six cups of cornflakes mix that all together and then you shape it into a wreath put some

49:38.400 --> 49:44.480
Some people like red hops for berries some people like I use mint M&Ms red mint M&Ms to make the berries

49:44.800 --> 49:47.120
Put it, you know on some wax paper make a wreath shape

49:47.600 --> 49:50.880
You got a holiday like delight there. That is good

49:50.880 --> 49:56.040
I want to see some J pegs of people who actually made that. Oh, yeah, make that Christmas wreath

49:56.040 --> 50:01.960
I made and this isn't just I made this last night. I think it was it's a McElroy family favorite

50:02.320 --> 50:04.480
Yeah, I don't know any other people that do that

50:04.480 --> 50:09.000
and if there are the other day and somebody looked like I was like

50:09.400 --> 50:14.520
Explaining the miracles of birth to them. They were amazed. Mm-hmm. Well, it is flavor birth

50:14.920 --> 50:19.800
Practically. Yeah, that's the birth of delicious. Huey flavor birth. I want to hear. Hey, hold on

50:20.080 --> 50:24.400
Yeah, I can tell you when in the show, but I have another yahoo that that really needs exploring

50:25.480 --> 50:28.580
Okay, is that okay? I know you're going long, but it's Christmas

50:29.920 --> 50:31.840
It is Christmas

50:31.840 --> 50:36.020
This is a yahoo answers question that I found by myself, which I haven't done in a long time

50:37.320 --> 50:39.320
We're very proud of you

50:39.880 --> 50:46.800
Something a long time. I don't know how people keep doing this because it's really difficult. Thank you so much for sitting in your questions

50:48.280 --> 50:53.160
It's by yahoo answers user balls W who asks oh

50:54.320 --> 50:56.320
man

50:56.320 --> 51:01.800
How can I tell my nine-year-old son? I'm not going to like his Christmas present. I

51:04.280 --> 51:09.360
Found my Christmas present in his room when I was snooping. How can I tell him that? I don't really want a mug

51:14.600 --> 51:18.360
I don't like my brother my brother and me. Why don't you get me this mug?

51:20.160 --> 51:23.480
That's gonna be a really rough conversation balls W because

51:23.480 --> 51:25.240
it

51:25.240 --> 51:28.000
Seems pretty contrary to the spirit of the holidays

51:30.120 --> 51:32.120
Hey

51:33.200 --> 51:35.200
Henry let's

51:35.240 --> 51:37.240
Have a chat. I

51:37.600 --> 51:44.500
Don't want to act surprised on Christmas or delighted, but I know about the mug you goofed

51:45.880 --> 51:47.880
You did a bad job

51:47.880 --> 51:53.240
Heft up do I look like a man who has a lack of things to

51:53.880 --> 51:59.600
Bev out with because I have plenty of I have a wide array of Tervis tumblers

52:00.640 --> 52:03.020
of cups handled cups

52:03.720 --> 52:10.280
I'm all set on that front. You know Henry. It's gifts like this that made your mother and I get divorced. So good job

52:10.960 --> 52:17.040
Henry am I on the naughty list? What have I done to get on your personal naughty list?

52:17.040 --> 52:18.880
What did I do? Where did I go wrong?

52:18.880 --> 52:23.900
You know you should do you should flip it right on its ear and give him presents that he doesn't want

52:24.320 --> 52:28.400
Just give him mugs like hey, here's turbo tax 2009 edition

52:30.900 --> 52:32.220
You're gonna love it

52:32.220 --> 52:38.560
Guess you just learned a lesson a thing or two because you really taught him now. No one's happy Merry Christmas

52:38.560 --> 52:43.680
I think if you don't like a mug you gotta wait till you open it and smash it against the wall

52:43.680 --> 52:51.640
Because that it would be such a great visual image. Okay, he's not he's he's I'll tell you if you if you if you're that

52:51.640 --> 52:56.200
If you take your nine-year-old son's Christmas gift, it's a mug you take it you look at it

52:56.240 --> 52:58.920
you make a face like you're retching inside like

52:59.640 --> 53:02.200
And then you smash against the wall that kids

53:02.200 --> 53:05.680
I don't know if he's gonna grow up angry or generate but he's gonna grow up special

53:05.800 --> 53:11.000
He's gonna be a special person a light a special be unique world Henry

53:11.000 --> 53:16.960
Why are you acting like a car? Oh, well, you see when I was nine, my dad didn't like my Christmas gift

53:18.520 --> 53:20.520
BMW face

53:21.840 --> 53:23.120
Listen

53:23.120 --> 53:25.420
Bad news balls W. Nobody

53:26.160 --> 53:32.060
Under the age of let's say 15 has ever bought a Christmas present for anybody that they wanted

53:32.400 --> 53:37.220
No, you don't learn how to do that. You don't learn how to divine people's you know

53:37.220 --> 53:42.020
Desires until at least age 15, I think and even that's pretty ahead of the curve

53:42.140 --> 53:46.600
What kind of budget is your nine-year-old working? Yeah. Yeah, right. I

53:47.180 --> 53:52.340
Might I have a sister in law. She's and she's a youngster

53:52.340 --> 53:56.860
She's just now turning 10 and I wish I had a museum of the Christmas presents

53:57.900 --> 54:00.140
They are awesome and and uh

54:00.140 --> 54:08.060
You're uh, and if you don't like a little kids present that they got you you're probably a monster. I would like for you to die

54:08.060 --> 54:09.780
Hey, can we curse?

54:09.780 --> 54:12.780
What I really want to curse this guy out cuz he sounds like a real

54:13.460 --> 54:17.900
It's a holiday. It's a holiday earmuffs earmuffs parents earmuffs parents

56:13.560 --> 56:15.560
I

56:21.480 --> 56:25.160

Then listen to you do this sad sack business again, so why don't you give give me that last guy?

56:32.920 --> 56:38.560

58:15.980 --> 58:18.180
Hi, I know this sounds kind of awkward or crazy

58:18.340 --> 58:24.580
But on my left wrist my veins spell out the letters ki and on my right wrist my veins spell out ng

58:24.660 --> 58:30.500
My middle name is in fact King. I've noticed this for the last two years and it will never go away

58:30.500 --> 58:33.700
It seems like I know my family is related to royalty

58:33.700 --> 58:37.340
I just want to know if this is common or if I'm just a king without his crown

58:37.340 --> 58:41.900
What I do happy birthday Jesus
