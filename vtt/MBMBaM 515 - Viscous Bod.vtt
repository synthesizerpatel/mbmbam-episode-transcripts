00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:49.600
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern

00:49.600 --> 00:56.640
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:56.640 --> 01:02.800
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Dang, you just came right in there with that,

01:02.800 --> 01:07.120
Griffin. I like the authoritativeness, you know what I mean? It's who I am,

01:07.680 --> 01:12.960
and I'm done hiding it behind a bunch of qualifiers. Yes, yes, you are the youngest

01:12.960 --> 01:21.520
brother. My name is Griffin, and I came after these two gentlemen. I was brewed up in the womb

01:21.520 --> 01:29.360
after these two gentlemen, and it's just a fluke that I'm the youngest one. And this is what fucks

01:29.360 --> 01:34.000
me up, and I think about this sometimes. I could have been Justin. Do you guys know what I'm saying?

01:35.040 --> 01:39.680
Then who would Justin be? I don't know, either you or me. But do you understand what I'm saying?

01:39.680 --> 01:47.040
Like, what if I came together first and Justin was the youngest? It's just like, right?

01:47.040 --> 01:52.560
I am okay with picturing you as the oldest and Justin as the youngest. I cannot think of myself

01:52.560 --> 01:58.000
as anyone but the middlest. I'd love to have your youth, Griffin. I'm so envious. I'm covetous of

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
your youth. I'd love another chance at these last seven years. Do you guys ever think about the fact

02:02.000 --> 02:09.440
that I get the best of both? That I'm not the oldest or the littlest? Yeah, not the smartest,

02:09.440 --> 02:15.120
not the most virile. But I'm also not the least smartest or the least virile, right?

02:15.120 --> 02:25.040
No, you're just kind of there. Your virility is just not. Listen, what I am, I'm the RPG character

02:25.040 --> 02:32.000
that doesn't get a lot of bonuses but gets like plus one to everything. Yeah, but you think like,

02:32.000 --> 02:38.560
he could be whatever he wants. He could be anything. Yeah. And then he doesn't. But then it's

02:38.560 --> 02:42.480
like, where did it go wrong? Well, I don't think anyone has ever looked at me and thought he could

02:42.480 --> 02:46.160
be anything. But I find that they've maybe looked at me and thought- No, certainly not. You didn't

02:46.160 --> 02:50.400
need to clarify that. No, but I think people might've looked at me and thought, I bet he could

02:50.400 --> 02:57.680
be mediocre at anything. Like I think that he could be a pretty average to slightly below average

02:57.680 --> 03:03.520
lawyer, right? Sure. So the king rolls up and he's like, oh, we need the most virile knight in the

03:03.520 --> 03:08.000
land. And I'm like, I got this one guys. And I walk off and then the queen comes up and is like,

03:08.000 --> 03:12.640
we need the most wise and sorcerer in the land. And Justin's like, don't worry guys, I got this.

03:13.360 --> 03:18.400
But then that's all the royalty that there is. No, but then, oh, excuse me. But then perhaps

03:18.400 --> 03:25.120
a Duke rolls up and says, I just, I'm on a budget and I need a good kind of catch all knight. And

03:25.120 --> 03:31.440
I'm like, I am the one for you. Listen, I'm a jack of all trades, master of none.

03:31.440 --> 03:40.000
The prince is like, I need someone to carry my packages back from ye gap.

03:42.240 --> 03:45.200
Now you've lost the, I feel like you lost the metaphor a little bit, Justin.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.200
Is that me? Cause I am the strongest.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.960
No, you're not the strongest. You just are strong enough to carry a package.

03:50.960 --> 03:54.000
Justin's the strongest. Justin's the strongest?

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah. Strongest, smartest, bravest, coolest.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.120
My head is like a shark's fin.

03:59.120 --> 04:05.200
I need someone to carry my light packages from the gap and half impregnate my wife.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.320
Yep. That's me.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.080
That's Travis. I can do both of those. But see, that's the thing. If someone said,

04:10.080 --> 04:13.440
I need someone to carry packages and impregnate my wife, everyone would be like,

04:13.440 --> 04:16.800
I can do one of those. And Justin would say, I can do one of those. And I would say,

04:16.800 --> 04:18.960
I can be mediocre at both of those.

04:18.960 --> 04:22.560
Well, no, I could do, I could half impregnate twice because I'm fully,

04:23.360 --> 04:25.440
I'm Herbie fully loaded over here.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.440
I mean, yes, that is true. Go to the doctor.

04:27.440 --> 04:32.000
What the fuck are we talking about? It feels like we're flying without a net a little bit.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.400
I'm loving it. I'm loving the energy. It's an exciting energy. It's an exciting time

04:36.400 --> 04:42.480
for no one. And we hope you are hanging in there with just like the world and stuff.

04:42.480 --> 04:46.400
We got a big show for you today. We've never done this before.

04:49.120 --> 04:53.040
You know what? You fucking jinxed me. You jinxed me because I was like,

04:53.040 --> 04:56.640
this is just easy free flow conversation. And then you were like, it's a show.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.920
We're like, oh no. Okay. I'm fucking James Corden now.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.920
We got the McElroy house band here.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.160
Let me hear you guys.

05:06.960 --> 05:10.400
You guys heard about this? Denny's has a new special.

05:12.640 --> 05:16.400
Oh, it's time for doing Munch Squad and Denny's is doing a new thing.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.280
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show, Rosario Dawson.

05:24.160 --> 05:24.800
Oh, wow.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.400
It's a big gift.

05:26.400 --> 05:32.320
Hey, it's me, Jake the snake. I got my big snake here to do tricks for you.

05:33.520 --> 05:40.400
Animal expert Jake the snake is here to show us his collection of reptiles.

05:40.400 --> 05:44.960
I've got three snakes. One, two.

05:48.720 --> 05:53.680
I'm into herpetology. I don't wrestle anymore. I got into actual snakes.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.000
Let's get into the advice.

05:56.000 --> 05:56.480
Yeah.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.920
We've waited long enough.

05:57.920 --> 06:02.800
This Monday I came home from my first shift back at work since the start of the apocalypse

06:02.800 --> 06:07.280
to find that all my posters about 15 had been flipped upside down.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.880
I have three younger siblings and a friend staying with me this summer.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.000
No one will confess.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.720
How do I find the flipper or at least get them to anonymously write the posters?

06:18.720 --> 06:21.840
That's from poster problem in the purple mountains.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.360
Wow. This is an easy one.

06:23.360 --> 06:28.240
Flip them back over and then when the person who did this ill-conceived prank sees that you have

06:28.240 --> 06:31.200
fixed it without even acknowledging that the prank has happened,

06:31.200 --> 06:34.400
they will feel a sense of shame that will be so heavy.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.400
It will be like a boulder has landed on them.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.400
There is nothing worse.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.720
The worst possible outcome to pulling a prank is that the other person is just kind of mildly

06:42.720 --> 06:45.360
annoyed by it and doesn't even like acknowledge.

06:45.360 --> 06:48.480
If you act like it made you sad, that's great.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.160
That could be cool.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.880
No, the worst possible outcome to a prank is somebody dies.

06:52.880 --> 06:53.440
Somebody dies.

06:54.240 --> 06:54.720
No, no, no.

06:54.720 --> 06:55.120
Okay.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.280
The worst possible outcome to a prank is everybody dies.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.000
Okay, yes.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.400
That is the worst possible outcome to everything.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.960
Or every all life.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.160
Just all life is extinction.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.520
Mass extinction is the worst possible outcome of a prank.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.320
Yes.

07:08.320 --> 07:11.440
Oh no, I put a bucket of water on top of a door frame

07:11.440 --> 07:14.160
and it fell and somehow cracked the earth in half.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.720
It fell onto a molten.

07:16.720 --> 07:17.200
Yeah, right.

07:17.200 --> 07:17.520
Exactly.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.960
You hit it in just the right way.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.800
The earth's got a glass jaw right there.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.680
Ashton made Beyonce think she knocked the Christmas tree over,

07:23.680 --> 07:27.360
but it unearthed some sort of turbo virus.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.720
Yeah, that's the worst possible outcome.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.080
I prank called someone a random dial number.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.360
It was Cthulhu.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.480
He got pissed.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.240
It was actually a nuclear launch code somehow.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.280
I don't know how that worked.

07:40.640 --> 07:44.800
But right behind that is being embarrassed because your prank was just sort of like

07:44.800 --> 07:47.520
brushed off annoyance by somebody else.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.200
So just flip these posters right back over.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.440
You're going to like the way you look, I guarantee it.

07:51.440 --> 07:52.400
Next question.

07:52.400 --> 07:57.600
You know what, I will say there is an opportunity for a poster whodunit here.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.160
Okay.

07:58.160 --> 08:03.120
And this could be a good mystery to cut your teeth on as a detective because-

08:03.120 --> 08:07.440
Everybody's always looking for that first big case.

08:07.440 --> 08:16.320
For Nancy Drew and her friends, it was when the city girl's doll went missing at the slumber party

08:16.320 --> 08:26.400
and she and the other members of the Clue crew got together and found the missing Hollywood Halle doll.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.640
And of course, Encyclopedia Brown's first case, it was Bugs Meanie and Bezzling.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.480
And Encyclopedia got him.

08:34.480 --> 08:34.980
Got him.

08:35.920 --> 08:38.640
But what I'm saying is the stakes are very low here.

08:38.640 --> 08:45.040
So if you do fail to solve it, you know, now you have a first case to look back on when you're like,

08:45.040 --> 08:49.760
you know, your close rate is 100% and people are like, ah, they always get it.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.120
They always get their person.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.200
And you're like, not this one time.

08:53.760 --> 08:54.480
It's what haunts me.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.680
It's what drives me.

08:55.680 --> 08:59.040
I'm like, oh no, did like a kidnapper get away or like a murderer?

08:59.040 --> 09:00.560
And you're like, a poster flipper.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.800
And I'm like, well, that's not so bad.

09:02.800 --> 09:03.680
And you're like, yeah, I know.

09:03.680 --> 09:05.120
It doesn't haunt me a lot.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.960
Just a little bit of haunting.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.880
It's just so low stakes.

09:12.880 --> 09:17.360
You have the opportunity here to dish out such a gnarly riposte,

09:17.360 --> 09:22.400
such a gnarly little parry counter-attack that like will completely...

09:22.960 --> 09:29.200
I remember one April Fool's Day when we were young, I tried to do some pranks on Travis,

09:29.200 --> 09:31.280
who I shared a room with at the time.

09:31.280 --> 09:34.800
And like one of the pranks, I remember this very clearly,

09:35.840 --> 09:40.080
is I took down whatever calendar you had.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.920
I think it was like a nerd-ass Xanth calendar, which hasn't aged well.

09:43.920 --> 09:47.360
And I replaced it with like your nerd-ass Xena calendar.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.760
And I was like, gotcha, motherfucker.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.760
And you were like, yeah, that's my Xena.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.560
Travis only reads his calendar as far as the X at the very beginning.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.120
Right.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.240
So he didn't even notice.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.280
He didn't even notice.

09:59.280 --> 10:03.920
But really this last 15 seconds or so was just me viciously dragging

10:03.920 --> 10:05.520
young Travis for happy Xena ends.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.120
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

10:07.120 --> 10:10.400
I mean, I'm embarrassed by Xanth because it didn't age well.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.040
Right.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.840
But I'm not embarrassed by liking things, Griffin.

10:13.840 --> 10:14.960
I enjoy things.

10:14.960 --> 10:15.440
I'm a fan.

10:15.440 --> 10:15.920
Sure.

10:15.920 --> 10:16.720
You want to list some other?

10:16.720 --> 10:17.920
I also like Supernatural.

10:19.280 --> 10:19.920
Oh, do you?

10:19.920 --> 10:20.560
Oh, you what?

10:20.560 --> 10:22.400
Oh, Travis, you like...

10:22.400 --> 10:25.040
But I didn't know you were a Supernatural fan.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.160
Oh, I hadn't mentioned it?

10:27.120 --> 10:28.320
Can I do a Yahoo?

10:28.320 --> 10:28.720
Yes, please.

10:28.720 --> 10:29.760
I like that, I think.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.120
This one was sent in by lots of folks.

10:31.120 --> 10:35.040
It's from anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I am gonna call Xena.

10:35.040 --> 10:35.520
Asks...

10:35.520 --> 10:37.520
Asks, do you...

10:37.520 --> 10:39.120
Sorry, Travis, not real.

10:39.120 --> 10:39.440
Oh.

10:40.080 --> 10:45.440
Do you miss the days when it was still popular to shop at Sears?

10:46.320 --> 10:46.720
Yes.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.800
That was a cool era.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.200
Yeah, I mean, I worked at a Sears.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.080
Worked at a Sears.

10:56.080 --> 10:56.560
Yeah.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.520
Wait, is that true?

10:57.520 --> 10:57.600
Yeah, it's true.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.280
At the Land's End department, correct?

10:59.280 --> 11:01.200
In the Land's End department.

11:01.200 --> 11:01.440
And I remember.

11:01.440 --> 11:07.040
And I would say you worked at a Land's End that was eaten by a Sears that was eaten by a mall.

11:07.680 --> 11:07.920
Sure.

11:08.960 --> 11:13.520
And I'll tell you what, it was cool in there every day for a while.

11:13.520 --> 11:17.200
It was like, I remember I'd be there and I'd look over and I'd be like,

11:17.200 --> 11:20.080
is that Ray Liotta shopping in the Land's End department?

11:20.080 --> 11:23.280
And it was, because it was cool to shop at Sears.

11:23.280 --> 11:28.480
And there's no one cooler than Ray Liotta who I need to now make a point of order.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.280
Just a quick Google.

11:29.280 --> 11:29.840
Make sure to eat.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.520
I know nothing about Ray Liotta.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.160
So if he's done some bad stuff, I take it all back.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.240
He hasn't done Xanth himself.

11:38.880 --> 11:46.880
Yeah, boy, Sears is a, I never necessarily understood Sears.

11:46.880 --> 11:54.320
Cause it's like where I went to get my inexpensive suit jackets for Cotillion.

11:54.320 --> 11:59.600
But also if we needed some new bedding and also some grill tools.

11:59.600 --> 11:59.920
Yeah.

11:59.920 --> 12:05.680
I don't necessarily love that all of that is in the same location.

12:05.680 --> 12:11.040
Sears is like the Travis McElroy of stores in that they don't really excel at any one thing,

12:11.040 --> 12:12.640
except Land's End clothing.

12:12.640 --> 12:12.960
Right.

12:12.960 --> 12:13.680
That was fine.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.120
Yeah.

12:15.120 --> 12:19.360
But it wasn't like, oh, who has the best fill in the blank?

12:19.360 --> 12:20.640
And the answer is not Sears.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.680
But if you're like, I only want to go to one place.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.960
Oh, good news.

12:24.960 --> 12:25.600
Good news.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.320
It's Sears.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.160
It's weird to be.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.840
I don't think, is Sears gone?

12:29.840 --> 12:30.960
Sears has got to be gone.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.080
If Sears ain't gone now, there's no way it's going to get through the unpleasantness.

12:34.080 --> 12:38.320
I mean, Sears is around, but like many Sears are not.

12:38.320 --> 12:44.640
Like Sears in Huntington closed in August last year.

12:44.640 --> 12:44.960
Wow.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.120
So it's been a little bit.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.720
Man, it was, I'm thinking about it though.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.640
It was fucking cool to shop at Sears.

12:51.200 --> 12:51.440
Right?

12:52.080 --> 12:56.000
I mean, the one in Huntington was next to the Quidoba and the Books of Millions.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.200
So that's cool.

12:57.200 --> 12:57.440
Yeah.

12:57.440 --> 13:03.920
Uh, cause you could get kind of like, get us, get a book to read and enjoy, get a snack

13:03.920 --> 13:08.960
and some chips at Quidoba and then go get yourself a socket wrench at Sears and just

13:08.960 --> 13:11.040
have an afternoon, make an afternoon of it.

13:11.040 --> 13:11.760
That's a nice shopping experience.

13:11.760 --> 13:12.880
That was so cool.

13:12.880 --> 13:20.160
I cannot tell you how many times I have needed to buy the hot new John Grisham book and fucking

13:20.160 --> 13:25.280
bust up a burrito and also buy a socket wrench and a webbed belt at the same store.

13:25.280 --> 13:29.520
And luckily that little corner of the mall always had my back, didn't it?

13:29.520 --> 13:33.760
You got to get that hot new socket wrench because you're like, I got this old busted

13:34.320 --> 13:35.280
socket wrench at home.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.280
It doesn't have all the new features.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.120
So they have the new ergonomics.

13:40.160 --> 13:45.520
I, um, I did a quick Google to double check the date on the Sears closing in the Huntington

13:45.520 --> 13:46.160
mall.

13:46.160 --> 13:51.600
And, uh, I just, I didn't want to say Google, the Google maps listing says temporarily close.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.760
You fucking go for it Sears.

13:53.760 --> 13:54.560
Fuck yeah, dude.

13:54.560 --> 13:55.680
You'd never know.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.240
You might be like, fire it back up.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.240
These people need washers and shorts.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.280
Let's go do it again.

14:04.240 --> 14:09.840
Last time I went to a Sears here in Austin, I needed, I did need a belt and I went to

14:09.840 --> 14:14.480
like the dress clothes section and they had just sort of a big metal garbage can full

14:14.480 --> 14:20.560
of belts and it feels like Sears is a lot of Sears are just kind of making it up as

14:20.560 --> 14:21.680
they go along.

14:21.680 --> 14:27.120
It feels like Sears always kind of has more stuff than it knows what to do with.

14:27.120 --> 14:32.960
And sometimes it dishes them up, um, uncooked, let's say in a, in a big garbage can.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.920
Did you try the Land's End department, Griffin, to see if they had any belts?

14:35.920 --> 14:38.800
The Land's End department was in incredible condition, Travis.

14:38.800 --> 14:42.960
Everything was, uh, it was like a museum for outdoor wear.

14:43.520 --> 14:43.680
Yep.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.280
That was our motto.

14:46.960 --> 14:47.600
Um.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.400
Fuck Macy's.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.760
Fuck Macy's though.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.080
Wow.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.080
Whoa.

14:52.080 --> 14:52.400
Just kidding.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.440
They're the same store.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.920
Um, they're basically, um, I.

14:55.920 --> 15:00.480
You know, nobody's making, nobody's starting new department stores anymore.

15:01.120 --> 15:01.760
It's weird.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.960
Yeah, it's, it's bizarre.

15:02.960 --> 15:09.840
I guess Amazon, um, there was a quote in, um, there's a quote in the, the WCHS story

15:09.840 --> 15:15.040
and I'm sorry to cheat on Rob Johnson by not talking about WSCC, but in the WSCC story

15:15.040 --> 15:18.480
about the Sears one closing, they captured, they got, I got a quote from the manager of

15:18.480 --> 15:23.280
the Huntington Mall, formerly Joe Johnson, our, our, uh, uh, down the block neighbor

15:23.280 --> 15:31.280
now, uh, replaced with, uh, Vals and Tenno and Vals and Tenno, um, a human, as he's always

15:31.280 --> 15:37.600
quick to point out to anybody who hears his name, Vals and Tenno says, everybody knows

15:37.600 --> 15:39.920
Sears for good or for bad.

15:39.920 --> 15:40.160
Whoa.

15:42.400 --> 15:42.880
Drag him.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.320
Fucking get him, Val.

15:44.880 --> 15:45.280
Damn.

15:45.840 --> 15:46.480
Anyway.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.760
Anyway, how about another.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.400
It's a pretty, pretty sick.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.400
Oh, fucking Sears.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.760
Don't get me started.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.920
Uh, yeah, uh, I would love that.

15:57.920 --> 16:01.680
Uh, I visited my local CVS a couple of weeks back.

16:01.680 --> 16:05.920
While there, one of the clerks asked me the name of the cologne I was wearing.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.360
I didn't know what it was called, but I told him I'd come back in a couple of days and

16:09.360 --> 16:10.320
let him know.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.720
When I returned to the store, the clerk was nowhere to be found.

16:12.720 --> 16:16.720
I returned to the store about once a week since then, but I haven't ran into that clerk

16:16.720 --> 16:17.040
again.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.680
Does he still want to know the name of my cologne?

16:19.680 --> 16:21.680
How do I get this information to him?

16:21.680 --> 16:23.040
Should I just give up my quest?

16:23.040 --> 16:25.120
That's from CVS Cologne Conundrum.

16:28.080 --> 16:34.800
It's weird that you don't know the name of the cologne you wear.

16:34.800 --> 16:38.960
Presumably you have to pick up this bottle every day, right, to squirt it on you.

16:38.960 --> 16:39.600
Right.

16:39.600 --> 16:43.360
That, this may be an indication that it's time to practice some mindfulness in your

16:43.360 --> 16:44.560
day-to-day life, maybe.

16:44.560 --> 16:48.960
Stop going through the motions and really read your bottle of cologne every day.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.240
That would be step one.

16:50.240 --> 16:54.320
I don't think you should give up this quest because he wouldn't have asked if he didn't

16:54.320 --> 16:54.880
want to know.

16:55.760 --> 17:00.000
Why would someone ask something that they don't want to know?

17:01.520 --> 17:05.440
He clearly is dying to know the name of your cologne, and it seems like you guys, much

17:05.440 --> 17:13.200
like the hit film Serendipity, are just barely missing each other until you reconnect in

17:13.200 --> 17:17.840
that magic moment and you're like, it's just like a body spray.

17:17.840 --> 17:19.360
It's like an axe thing.

17:19.360 --> 17:20.000
It's like an axe.

17:20.960 --> 17:21.840
Oh my god, you're there.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.320
It's fucking bod.

17:24.320 --> 17:27.280
I found an old bottle of bod and I'm wearing bod.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.000
Oh, thank god.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.360
It was pretty viscous.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.840
I had to scoop it out with a tongue depressor.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.360
It didn't, it wouldn't, it wouldn't spray anymore.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.880
It was all gummed up.

17:36.880 --> 17:43.680
It's like a bod jam and it's, it goes on smooth.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.720
Two, I have two thoughts that kind of dovetail into each other.

17:46.720 --> 17:51.760
One, don't tell anyone the name of the cologne that you're wearing.

17:51.760 --> 17:57.440
I certainly wouldn't because the last thing I want is other people out there smelling

17:57.440 --> 18:03.760
like me, you know, and like stealing my profile, doing whatever the fuck they want with it,

18:04.400 --> 18:06.240
robbing banks with a mask on.

18:06.240 --> 18:10.400
That masked robber sure smelled like Griffin and then I'm in jail.

18:10.400 --> 18:10.640
Yeah.

18:10.640 --> 18:14.320
But the other thing is that you always have the opportunity when somebody asks you what

18:14.320 --> 18:18.160
scent you're wearing to say like, oh, I'm not wearing anything, you silly.

18:18.160 --> 18:18.880
Oh yeah.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.400
This is my fair man's.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.160
That's just, that's just me.

18:22.160 --> 18:27.280
Also, it's been a long time since I bought cologne, but I remember that I would never

18:27.280 --> 18:31.200
tell anybody the name of the cologne I was wearing because I can't remember the last

18:31.200 --> 18:36.320
time I heard the name of a cologne and thought, that's a cool name of a thing to say out loud.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.040
Yeah.

18:37.040 --> 18:42.400
I mean, for a while, because I was a person in the 90s and early 2000s, I wore Curve.

18:42.400 --> 18:43.840
Oh yeah.

18:43.840 --> 18:47.280
And then for a while I got bored because everyone was wearing Curve.

18:47.280 --> 18:50.720
So I started wearing him Bora Bora.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.240
Oh yeah.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.680
Oh, going on a trip.

18:54.240 --> 18:54.740
Yeah.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.640
There's just, I don't know a cool name.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.840
Like what you could be like, what scent, what is that cologne?

19:01.840 --> 19:05.760
And you would say a word and be like, oh, that was a cool thing to say out loud with

19:05.760 --> 19:06.240
your face.

19:06.240 --> 19:06.560
Yeah.

19:07.120 --> 19:11.520
I mean, I did briefly have a stint where I tried on 23 by Michael Jordan when I tried

19:11.520 --> 19:16.240
out for the high school basketball team because I was dressing for the job that I wanted.

19:17.440 --> 19:23.440
But I was terribly allergic to this scent.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.720
Did Michael Jordan start 23 and me?

19:27.760 --> 19:28.320
He did.

19:28.320 --> 19:28.560
Yeah.

19:28.560 --> 19:37.040
And originally it was a sort of program where he would fly to your house and he would show

19:37.040 --> 19:42.080
you some of his favorite shots that he can take from like different places.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.600
And also swab the inside of your cheek, but just cause.

19:45.600 --> 19:45.920
Yeah.

19:45.920 --> 19:46.800
That was just for him.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.720
Griff, do you have another Yahoo?

19:48.720 --> 19:52.960
I do have a Yahoo here and this one was sent in by Emma Cant.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.240
Thank you, Emma, crushing it.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.200
It's another anonymous Yahoo answers user.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.880
Put your fucking name on your work, Michael Jordan asks.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.400
Ooh, what a gift.

20:02.400 --> 20:07.040
Titanic was such an excellent movie that it's hard to critique anything about it.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.960
But what is something small you would critique about it?

20:11.840 --> 20:13.440
I didn't like that the boat broke.

20:14.640 --> 20:18.480
The boat breaks, it's like, what were you doing?

20:18.480 --> 20:23.600
Yeah, they spend this whole movie like getting us way into the boat and way into like the

20:23.600 --> 20:24.560
people on it.

20:24.560 --> 20:28.240
And then they're just like, twist, the boat broke.

20:28.240 --> 20:33.600
And you know, Jimmy Cameron like spent a bunch of money building this huge boat prop and

20:33.600 --> 20:37.520
then he accidentally broke it and was like, I don't know, we got to keep making it.

20:38.320 --> 20:42.640
Because they talked throughout the movie a lot about how the boat is unbreakable.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.040
They're like, this is an unbreakable boat.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.080
And then they break it.

20:46.080 --> 20:49.920
And it's like, that's bad writing because like you said it was unbreakable.

20:49.920 --> 20:50.560
You lied.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.800
You are an unreliable narrator.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.280
You said that the boat was unbreakable and then you broke it.

20:55.280 --> 20:58.880
That's like having a murder mystery where it's just like, they didn't do it, but then

20:58.880 --> 21:00.000
they did do it.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.440
Well, you know that, you know why that happened, right?

21:03.440 --> 21:03.840
Why?

21:03.840 --> 21:06.960
This is actually pretty well established Hollywood lore.

21:06.960 --> 21:07.440
I heard it.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.480
I think I heard it on Blake Chuck.

21:09.360 --> 21:16.320
He wrote like two thirds of a movie about these two people falling in love on the Titanic

21:16.320 --> 21:19.200
and he couldn't come up with an ending.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.480
And he's like, God, I've written so many fucking pages of this thing.

21:22.480 --> 21:26.800
And then he's like, maybe, and then maybe what if the boat had sunk?

21:26.800 --> 21:28.960
And everybody's like, are you kidding?

21:28.960 --> 21:31.280
He's like, no, but what if it had sunk?

21:31.280 --> 21:35.760
Well, and everybody's like, the Titanic was fine and is still fine to this day,

21:35.760 --> 21:37.440
shoveling people back and forth.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.920
And Jimmy's like, but what if it?

21:39.920 --> 21:41.040
What if it broke and sunk to the bottom?

21:41.040 --> 21:44.400
What if it broke and that was the end of the love story I did?

21:44.400 --> 21:46.720
I also don't like that they don't end up together.

21:47.680 --> 21:48.880
It sucks.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.800
And this is my main problem with the movie.

21:50.800 --> 21:54.800
If I'm going to, and it's a fucking great flick and it's like impossible to critique it.

21:54.800 --> 21:59.440
But if I were to critique it, I would say that it spends a great deal of time

22:00.160 --> 22:08.480
making me fall in love with all of these amazing characters like Jack and Kathy Bates.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.080
And Billy Zane.

22:10.080 --> 22:10.880
And Billy Zane.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.760
And then like most of them die.

22:13.760 --> 22:18.480
And it's like, why did you just spend like two and a half hours making me like get to know

22:18.480 --> 22:22.720
Kathy Bates' character name only to kill her off, I think maybe at the end of the movie.

22:22.720 --> 22:24.000
That's a fucking great.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.240
Okay, Griffin, you have actually hit on something.

22:26.240 --> 22:27.200
It fucking sucks.

22:27.200 --> 22:27.600
It's a waste of my time.

22:27.600 --> 22:32.240
Unintentionally, you've hit on something because the two main characters,

22:32.240 --> 22:36.880
Jack Dawson and Rose, should have been Rose Dawson.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.400
They should have gotten married.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.600
Should have gotten married on the boat.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.320
There was a captain right there.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.760
You know, real quick.

22:45.760 --> 22:48.400
I do want to just as long as I want to get to my point.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.840
But Bill Paxton's character was named Brock Lovett.

22:51.840 --> 22:55.920
And that is that is one of the few characters who is a complete invention by Jimmy Cameron.

22:55.920 --> 22:59.120
So he's just like, what would be a good name for an undersea explorer?

22:59.120 --> 22:59.920
I got it.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.960
Brock Lovett.

23:00.960 --> 23:03.360
Well, he said the name is Brock and someone said Lovett.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.040
And he said, yeah, okay, perfect.

23:05.040 --> 23:05.600
Exactly.

23:05.600 --> 23:05.840
Good.

23:06.880 --> 23:13.280
It's the Titanic sucks because you're getting invested in those characters, right?

23:13.280 --> 23:19.200
And then towards the end, spoilers, but towards the end, the boat break and everybody sink into ocean.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.480
And dies.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.520
That actually made me sad.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.000
Right.

23:24.000 --> 23:30.720
And that's like, it was so stupid because I want to I want to watch movie to feel good.

23:30.720 --> 23:31.200
Right.

23:31.200 --> 23:31.440
Right.

23:31.440 --> 23:35.280
But you actually you fucked up because it made me sad.

23:35.280 --> 23:35.520
Yeah.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.280
Why did you waste all this time?

23:37.920 --> 23:39.040
What they should have done?

23:39.040 --> 23:40.000
I'm going to fix it real quick.

23:40.000 --> 23:40.320
Yeah.

23:40.320 --> 23:47.120
What it should have done is if Leonardo DiCaprio had been a real dingus the entire time.

23:47.120 --> 23:47.680
Right.

23:47.680 --> 23:55.920
Like he kept like, you know, like stuff like stealing Rose's wallet.

23:55.920 --> 23:56.160
Yeah.

23:56.160 --> 24:02.160
She wasn't paying attention and putting taking your dog and like your dog overboard.

24:02.160 --> 24:02.720
Yeah.

24:02.720 --> 24:06.320
Just kicking Kathy Bates every time she's on like just walking out.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.160
Yes, I love that.

24:08.160 --> 24:10.240
Exactly. Yeah, exactly.

24:10.240 --> 24:16.160
Like putting out lit cigarettes and Billy Zane's bald head and he even did all this shit.

24:16.160 --> 24:21.440
And then that would have kicked ass because when she shoved him off the door,

24:21.440 --> 24:24.320
you would have been like, fuck, yes, get him.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.480
And then she could have said something cool like, you know what?

24:26.480 --> 24:28.160
We're breaking up and shoved him off the door.

24:28.160 --> 24:28.560
Yeah.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.680
Or how about this, Travis?

24:29.680 --> 24:30.480
How about this?

24:30.480 --> 24:33.440
How about when she's like, hey, you're dumped.

24:33.440 --> 24:40.160
And then as he sank into the ocean and it's like, you'd feel good.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.840
You would feel good if they did that.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.840
And can I make one more note?

24:43.840 --> 24:45.040
Can I make one more note?

24:45.040 --> 24:47.280
I'd love to keep fixing Titanic for sure.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.560
They're steering the boat, the captain's steering and he's doing a great job.

24:50.560 --> 24:53.040
I think driving the boat is the actual proper.

24:53.040 --> 24:55.520
But he's like, I'm going to steer it right next to this big iceberg

24:55.520 --> 24:57.520
so everyone can get a good look at the iceberg.

24:57.520 --> 25:02.400
And then maybe there's like a clumsy crewman who like, whoa, and he bumps the wheel.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.200
And that's what makes it go into it.

25:05.200 --> 25:10.960
So it's like, oh, this was like completely avoidable if it wasn't for like clumsy Steve

25:10.960 --> 25:13.520
and like clumsy Steve like runs into the wheel.

25:13.520 --> 25:16.400
And then, so it's kind of funny for a second.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.000
And it's like a big like, whoa.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.360
That could be really good.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.760
Do you know what would be like fucking cooler?

25:21.760 --> 25:23.360
I want to fix it more, okay?

25:23.360 --> 25:23.680
Yeah.

25:23.680 --> 25:29.760
What if you cut down the stuff with Jack and Rose to about five minutes of the movie?

25:29.760 --> 25:36.880
And I think, and I think we all know which five minutes.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.000
As long as they're there, by the way.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.440
Then when he was done drawing her, he should have said, now draw me.

25:43.440 --> 25:44.800
His dick and his balls.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.760
Three, okay, so five minutes of it is that.

25:47.760 --> 25:52.240
And the other three hours and 10 minutes is you animate the iceberg

25:52.800 --> 25:57.440
and give it like, make it talk about all its hopes and dreams and shit.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.080
And then when the boat comes, you're like, oh, fuck no.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.600
No, not the iceberg.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.880
I see the iceberg.

26:04.880 --> 26:06.400
He's about to get hit by a boat.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.840
Get out of the way, Icy.

26:07.840 --> 26:09.600
And you'll just be screaming about that.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.640
Those people will keep going.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.240
You won't give a fuck about that.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.760
They can all think for all you care.

26:13.760 --> 26:16.000
All you care about is like, is Icy okay?

26:16.000 --> 26:17.360
And here's the thing about this version.

26:17.920 --> 26:18.400
He is.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.760
Oh, okay.

26:19.760 --> 26:20.480
He's fine.

26:20.480 --> 26:21.280
He's cool.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.040
Maybe he doesn't even notice.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.400
You feel happy about it.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.440
You like that.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.520
Can I give one more note?

26:27.520 --> 26:30.320
Well, let me do one because I haven't gotten to tell a joke in a while.

26:30.320 --> 26:30.820
Okay.

26:31.680 --> 26:34.560
They also could have done, they could have had their cake and eat it too

26:34.560 --> 26:37.360
where Jack's sinking into the bottom of the ocean and dying.

26:37.360 --> 26:39.520
And all of us are like, wait a minute.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.520
This movie is making me feel pretty bad right now.

26:41.520 --> 26:44.720
But then he wakes up on the boat still not broken.

26:44.720 --> 26:49.600
And it was a dream and looks over and him and Rose just finished like hooking up again.

26:49.600 --> 26:56.160
Yeah, and they get married and like, she looks at him and is like, what's wrong, my love?

26:56.160 --> 26:57.600
It seems like you're having a bad dream.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.840
He was like, I was, but now it's over.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.480
And guess what?

27:00.480 --> 27:03.600
And he holds up the big blue diamond necklace.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.120
He says, I got the treasure.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.840
And then that's the end of the movie.

27:07.840 --> 27:11.840
And then, you know, like he got the treasure and gets like, they're going to have a lot of money

27:11.840 --> 27:13.760
whenever they get off the boat and they're going to have a cool ride.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.240
And they'll return in Titanic 2, Teutonic.

27:16.240 --> 27:21.280
But in the Titanic we got, which now I'm thinking about it is a shit flick.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.080
It sucks.

27:22.080 --> 27:27.840
The more we pick at some of the loose threads, I don't even feel like the cinema sins on this one

27:27.840 --> 27:30.640
went far enough because it's like, there's some really bad ones.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.400
We start out with Brock fuck it.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.200
And he's like, I'm going to find the big treasure to get lots of money.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.280
And you're like, oh, that would be fucking cool.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.160
I can't wait to watch this.

27:38.160 --> 27:40.720
I love movies about like finding cool treasures.

27:40.720 --> 27:45.760
And then you watch this whole movie thinking like, when is the treasure going to come into play?

27:45.760 --> 27:47.600
And then they like tease at it a few times.

27:47.600 --> 27:51.520
And then she is wearing it in the nudity sequence.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.800
And then like at the, and then at the, and the whole time, all these people die.

27:54.800 --> 27:55.840
And you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:56.560 --> 28:00.080
But like, is Brock going to get the cool treasure or not?

28:00.080 --> 28:02.240
And then at the very end, she throws it in the water.

28:02.880 --> 28:03.360
No, thank you.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.120
What's the point of this movie?

28:05.120 --> 28:07.520
I would like to add a little bit to that scene to fix it.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.560
Well, not to fix it, but just to kind of highlight it for a moment.

28:10.560 --> 28:13.440
Because I think she should, well, she shouldn't drop it in the ocean.

28:13.440 --> 28:17.280
But if she does drop it in the ocean, her daughter, who is also there,

28:17.280 --> 28:22.080
should walk out and say, hey, did you just throw that priceless gem in the ocean?

28:22.080 --> 28:23.600
You have a family.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.560
You have a family.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.400
You could have given that to me.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.840
And that really would have helped, you know, our financials.

28:29.840 --> 28:35.760
I live in a crude tit that I fashioned together from those drawings of yours

28:35.760 --> 28:38.240
that you gave me of yourself naked.

28:38.240 --> 28:42.240
I have to live in a crude tit made out of naked drawings of you.

28:42.240 --> 28:43.680
Please just sell the neck.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.400
What the fuck?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.000
You've had that this whole time?

28:46.000 --> 28:49.520
When dad needed surgery and we had to do a GoFundMe,

28:49.520 --> 28:52.000
you had a fucking heart of the ocean?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.520
We could have sold?

28:53.520 --> 28:55.040
But then she says, no, no, no, no.

28:55.040 --> 28:55.680
Look down there.

28:55.680 --> 28:56.800
It's a shithead whale.

28:56.800 --> 29:00.000
And you look down and she landed it right in his blowhole and he died.

29:00.800 --> 29:01.760
That's pretty good.

29:01.760 --> 29:05.680
I named him Jack after another shithead I knew that died also.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.200
Can I get one more note?

29:07.200 --> 29:09.760
He's been Mad Dog in our boat here this whole time.

29:09.760 --> 29:12.720
But don't worry, I took care of it.

29:12.720 --> 29:13.600
I have one more note.

29:13.600 --> 29:14.880
I have one more note.

29:14.880 --> 29:15.680
Yeah, please.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.680
I think they should have hooked up in a cooler car.

29:19.920 --> 29:23.360
Yeah, that old busted joint that they hooked up in.

29:23.360 --> 29:28.800
That raggedy old car that they had was absolutely embarrassing.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.280
Picture this, a sick, like, firebird.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.840
Like, oh, yeah.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.680
Like, oh, with the top down.

29:35.680 --> 29:39.920
And maybe they're blasting, like, some Eagles music while they're, like, doing it.

29:39.920 --> 29:41.600
Travis, look out above.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.440
Fucking Oscars are falling off of you.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.560
Oh my god.

29:46.560 --> 29:50.320
And what would be dope is, like, when the hand comes up and, like, slaps the window

29:50.320 --> 29:53.840
and wipes some of the steam off the window of the Bugatti that they're shagging in,

29:53.840 --> 29:57.840
you see now through the cleared window, Kathy Bates is just, like, looking in there like,

29:59.040 --> 29:59.540
great.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.440
Oh my god, I just got a fax from Jimmy.

30:03.440 --> 30:06.960
He said, Justin would love for you to walk through the beats on Av2.

30:06.960 --> 30:07.920
Yeah, all right.

30:07.920 --> 30:08.800
See, make sure.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.600
I'm thinking about delaying it just so I can really crack this nut.

30:11.600 --> 30:17.040
What if Avatar 2 was just a sequel, like, a backdoor sequel to Titanic,

30:17.040 --> 30:19.120
where they got in there and it was, like, a VR session?

30:19.120 --> 30:19.600
Stop it.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.200
Avatar is a perfect film.

30:21.200 --> 30:21.520
Never seen it.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.440
It's not a piece of shit like Titanic.

30:23.440 --> 30:24.640
Avatar is perfect.

30:24.640 --> 30:26.960
Yeah, because it's bad.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.880
They have badass fights and it makes you feel good at the end of it.

30:28.880 --> 30:29.360
It's weird.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.200
I think it's time for a Titanic reboot.

30:31.200 --> 30:40.800
The good news is, because of our incredible fortune in becoming Jimmy's sort of dudes behind

30:40.800 --> 30:46.960
the scenes pulling all the strings, we no longer require the money from our advertisers.

30:46.960 --> 30:48.400
That's wonderful news for us.

30:48.400 --> 30:48.960
Yes.

30:48.960 --> 30:53.680
And it's also wonderful news for this week's charity that we've selected.

30:54.480 --> 30:58.640
Yeah, this week we are donating our ad revenue to the Foundation for Black Women's Wellness,

30:58.640 --> 31:04.560
which is all about supporting and advocating for black women and their families during,

31:05.360 --> 31:10.240
well, especially right now during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it's all about, you know,

31:10.240 --> 31:13.200
supporting those families and keeping them safe and healthy all the time.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.640
So you can read about it.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.320
We'll have a link to that in the episode description.

31:16.320 --> 31:16.720
Perfect.

31:16.720 --> 31:29.360
Let's go to the Money Zone.

31:29.360 --> 31:31.440
I want to talk about Honey.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.320
I love the stuff.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.200
Comes from bees.

31:33.840 --> 31:35.280
Don't get people confused.

31:35.280 --> 31:43.200
Honey is an online service that you plug into your web browser and when you're shopping online,

31:43.200 --> 31:46.640
you're about to check out, there's a little Honey pops up and it's like, hey, can I save

31:46.640 --> 31:47.520
you some money real quick?

31:47.520 --> 31:50.080
And you're like, sure, I guess.

31:51.760 --> 31:52.880
And that's Honey for you.

31:55.200 --> 31:55.920
Are you reading?

31:55.920 --> 31:58.320
This ad copy is out of control.

31:58.320 --> 32:01.040
I'm reading the ad copy now and that's what threw me?

32:01.680 --> 32:04.560
Okay, so this is the fucking ad copy for Honey.

32:04.560 --> 32:07.360
In case you, okay, it saves you a lot of money when you're shopping online.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.920
You should absolutely get Honey.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.120
But listen to this.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.440
This is the ad copy that they sent to us.

32:14.560 --> 32:17.840
Only one sponsor could properly ring in 20 Honey.

32:17.840 --> 32:24.000
Honey, the free online shopping tool packed back by PayPal that gets straight to business

32:24.000 --> 32:27.840

32:32.720 --> 32:33.280
Outstanding.

32:33.840 --> 32:34.560
Outstanding.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.880
Thank you for your inspiring work, Honey.

32:36.880 --> 32:41.760
I don't like direct addressing Honey.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.080
It makes me feel like a sleazy boss from the 60s.

32:45.200 --> 32:52.480
But anyway, I have had to buy a few tools lately when I have been checking out.

32:52.480 --> 32:58.320
I've used Honey and I've saved like 50 bucks just this week via Honey.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.640
You're just losing money if you don't use it.

33:00.640 --> 33:01.760
It's free.

33:01.760 --> 33:02.880
It installs in seconds.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.480
It's super easy to use.

33:04.480 --> 33:10.720
Just go to joinhoney.com slash brother.

33:11.440 --> 33:15.680
That's joinhoney.com slash brother.

33:15.680 --> 33:16.480
Give it a try.

33:16.480 --> 33:18.880
You will not be sad that you did.

33:19.680 --> 33:20.720
You'll be happy.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.320
The opposite, happy you did.

33:22.320 --> 33:24.240
Well, I don't want to get, you know what I mean?

33:24.240 --> 33:30.000
Listen, you live in now, you won't be happy, but you won't be sad.

33:30.000 --> 33:30.480
How's that?

33:30.480 --> 33:36.880
Uh, hey, stamps.com is going to get you stamps without you needing to go to the post office.

33:36.880 --> 33:40.800
And that's like, that's let's just put the tiger on the table and yell at it.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.560
You don't need to go to the post office to get stamps for, you know, your letters or

33:44.560 --> 33:48.560
packages or whatever, because stamps.com brings all the services of the US Postal Service right

33:48.560 --> 33:52.560

33:56.800 --> 33:58.000
And so that's pretty cool.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.080
Uh, use your computer and like on reboot.

34:00.640 --> 34:01.600
Yeah, basically like reboot.

34:01.600 --> 34:04.400
So you have all kinds of mail carriers that live in there and

34:04.400 --> 34:06.320

34:06.320 --> 34:11.040

class of mail, anywhere you want to send it 24 seven, no questions asked.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.400
I don't know that last part.

34:17.600 --> 34:20.480
They may ask a couple of questions to make sure the mail gets to the right place.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.840
But anyway, once it's ready, you just leave your mail for the mail carrier and you, or

34:23.840 --> 34:26.560
you schedule a free package pickup or you drop it in a mailbox.

34:26.560 --> 34:30.000

34:43.920 --> 34:47.600
Just go to stamps.com, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage, type in my brother.

34:47.600 --> 34:49.120
All one word that's stamps.com.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.240
Enter my brother.

34:50.240 --> 34:51.680
Stay safe, my friends.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.040
Listen, I'm going to talk about Warby Parker in a second.

34:55.040 --> 35:00.000
But first, do you guys ever think about the mythology that Reboot was building that was

35:00.000 --> 35:05.680
every time you played a game on your computer, you were putting the residents of your computer

35:05.680 --> 35:06.160
at risk?

35:07.520 --> 35:08.400
Every time.

35:08.400 --> 35:08.720
Okay.

35:09.680 --> 35:10.640
That's a weird thing.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.080
Oh, you want to play that cool racing game?

35:14.080 --> 35:14.720
Murderer.

35:15.280 --> 35:15.520
Yeah.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.320
Now, back to Warby Parker.

35:18.320 --> 35:22.720
Warby Parker was founded with the goal to create boutique quality eyewear at

35:22.720 --> 35:25.120
revolutionary price points.

35:25.120 --> 35:25.680
And they did it.

35:25.680 --> 35:31.120
I, this is not a joke, am wearing Warby Parkers right now.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.720
And if you're like me and Griffin and not Justin-

35:34.720 --> 35:36.160
Why would that be a joke?

35:36.160 --> 35:36.880
What?

35:36.880 --> 35:37.440
Why would that be a joke?

35:37.440 --> 35:39.840
That would be a really shitty, not funny joke.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.280
If I said like no bullshit.

35:41.280 --> 35:43.040
Listen, this is a no bullshit zone.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.320
I'm wearing Warby Parkers.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.320
They probably don't love the cursing and stuff.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.520
No bullcorn.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.120
It's a family company, Travis.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.360
The Warby Parker's on my face right now.

35:51.360 --> 35:54.160
They're adorning my nose and improving my vision.

35:54.160 --> 35:56.400
And Griffin wears glasses too, and Justin does not.

35:57.120 --> 36:02.320
And the end of Travis' book report on who wears glasses.

36:02.960 --> 36:07.280
My favorite thing is Warby Parker doesn't just offer glasses.

36:07.280 --> 36:12.080
They also offer sunglasses, which I require to see when it is bright outside.

36:12.080 --> 36:16.320
They also have contact lenses and eye exams.

36:16.320 --> 36:20.480
They're committed to providing exceptional vision care online and in stores.

36:20.480 --> 36:23.040
We have a Warby Parker store here in Cincinnati.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.280
So I love them.

36:25.280 --> 36:29.040
They're comfortable and they have sizes big enough to fit my giant head,

36:29.040 --> 36:30.800
which I really appreciate.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.080
And they're stylish and cool.

36:32.720 --> 36:36.560
Warby Parker is committed to providing exceptional vision care online and in stores.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.480
The glasses start at $95.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.760
It includes prescription lenses.

36:41.760 --> 36:45.040
And like I said, they have sunglasses, progressive and blue light lenses.

With me in studio to take your calls is the dopest duo on the West Coast,

37:12.320 --> 37:14.880
Oliver Wong and Morgan Rhodes.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.160
Go ahead, caller.

37:16.160 --> 37:20.160
Hey, I'm looking for a music podcast that's insightful and thoughtful,

37:20.160 --> 37:23.760
but like also helps me discover artists and albums that I've never heard of.

37:23.760 --> 37:24.240
Yeah, man.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.640
It sounds like you need to listen to Heat Rocks every week.

37:26.640 --> 37:30.080
Myself and I'm Morgan Rhodes and my co-host here, Oliver Wong,

37:30.080 --> 37:35.360
talk to influential guests about a canonical album that has changed their lives.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.600
Guests like Moby, Open Mic Eagle,

37:37.600 --> 37:41.440
talk about albums by Prince, Joni Mitchell, and so much more.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.440
Yo, what's that show called again?

37:43.440 --> 37:46.240
Heat Rocks, deep dives into hot records.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.240
Every Thursday on Maximum Fund.

37:50.080 --> 37:52.320
So a brief story before we move on.

37:52.320 --> 37:57.440
Last month, which seems like 100,000 years ago,

37:57.440 --> 38:03.440
we recorded a brief interview with our dear friend, Dr. James Buffett,

38:04.720 --> 38:09.760
about life and how to stay calm in the face of calamity.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.920
Home summer vibes.

38:11.920 --> 38:16.000
Yeah, summer vibes and a little bit about his new album,

38:16.720 --> 38:18.480
Life on the Flipside, that came out last month.

38:19.360 --> 38:23.600
And then in the face of the Black Lives Matter protests

38:23.600 --> 38:27.520
and just everything going on,

38:27.520 --> 38:31.680
it didn't seem like a great time to be encouraging people to relax.

38:31.680 --> 38:33.760
To live in island time, necessarily.

38:33.760 --> 38:34.720
Yes, exactly.

38:34.720 --> 38:37.520
And I would argue that it is still not that,

38:37.520 --> 38:40.960
but we still think it's important to take a little bit of time to breathe

38:40.960 --> 38:42.320
just so you can get back out there.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.240
And when you need a second to breathe,

38:45.440 --> 38:50.160
there's nobody better than Jimmy Buffett to help you do that.

38:50.160 --> 38:53.280
So let's check in with Jimmy.

38:53.840 --> 38:58.640
We're joined by, for an update on progress of coronavirus research,

38:58.640 --> 39:01.200
we're joined by lead researcher, Dr. James Buffett.

39:01.920 --> 39:06.160
Dr. Buffett, how is work going on the antidote for coronavirus?

39:06.160 --> 39:07.840
Have you almost got this thing figured out?

39:07.840 --> 39:10.480
Uh, yes, I do.

39:10.480 --> 39:13.040
It's, uh, it's jellyfish.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.240
Jellyfish?

39:14.240 --> 39:15.840
Where we least expected it.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.080
The venom of the jellyfish,

39:18.080 --> 39:21.520
or is it part of like a diet, a sort of dietary situation?

39:21.520 --> 39:23.120
I think that it's the venom.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.040
I'm not supposed to say.

39:25.040 --> 39:26.640
Oh, okay, yeah, you want to keep it out.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.160
You know what's going to happen now,

39:28.160 --> 39:28.720
they're going to say,

39:28.720 --> 39:30.080
Jimmy Buffett's found it.

39:30.080 --> 39:31.360
Why did y'all open this?

39:31.360 --> 39:34.560
And I actually responded to that question.

39:34.560 --> 39:36.160
I'm just guessing here, Jimmy,

39:36.160 --> 39:38.640
and this is Jessica, this is related to nothing,

39:38.640 --> 39:41.760
but have you been awarded any honorary doctorates

39:41.760 --> 39:42.960
from any universities?

39:42.960 --> 39:44.800
Are you Dr. Jimmy Buffett yet?

39:44.800 --> 39:45.760
I am, I am.

39:45.760 --> 39:46.960
Yes, I knew it.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.160
Wait, I got one in here.

39:48.160 --> 39:49.360
Maybe it's in the room.

39:49.360 --> 39:50.880
Just got him lying around.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.160
Just like, reach out.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.520
It's a pile of honorary doctorates.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.520
I swear to God, it might be.

39:55.520 --> 39:58.000
He's got one under a wobbly table leg somewhere.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.760
No, no, oh no.

39:59.760 --> 40:03.200
That's the CMA award for, uh, where was it?

40:03.200 --> 40:06.720
Country Music Association Musical of the Year.

40:07.360 --> 40:08.720
I don't know what the fuck that is.

40:08.720 --> 40:09.220
Okay.

40:09.680 --> 40:10.720
No, but I do.

40:10.720 --> 40:14.560
I have a doctorate of music from the University of Miami.

40:14.560 --> 40:14.960
Nice.

40:14.960 --> 40:15.360
All right.

40:15.360 --> 40:16.640
They don't disown something.

40:16.640 --> 40:21.760
Dr. Jimmy Buffett says, Jellyfish, uh, how are you, uh,

40:21.760 --> 40:23.040
how are you handling it?

40:23.040 --> 40:24.720
How are you, how are you dealing with it?

40:24.720 --> 40:26.000
You know, it's funny.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.800
No matter how good things are in my life,

40:28.800 --> 40:31.040
I usually have the thought,

40:31.040 --> 40:33.120
well, I bet Jimmy Buffett's probably having more fun

40:33.120 --> 40:34.400
than I am right now.

40:34.400 --> 40:37.200
And I feel like this period is the one shot I have

40:37.200 --> 40:39.440
where maybe at any given moment,

40:39.440 --> 40:41.840
I might be having more fun than you are.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.960
Just in, in one moment, one, no, you're shaking your head.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.160
No, no.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.520
I bet you've been in just like some boring place.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.680
You're probably in Cleveland or something.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.600
You're stuck, landlocked in Cleveland.

40:56.160 --> 40:57.040
Malibu.

40:57.040 --> 40:57.680
Dang it.

40:57.680 --> 40:58.800
Dang it, Jimmy.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.600
This is my chance.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.880
Stuck in Malibu.

41:03.840 --> 41:07.680
Now I have heard Cleveland referred to as the Malibu of Ohio.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.760
Listen, I couldn't agree more.

41:11.760 --> 41:14.560
Listen, I'm very, you know, they've been very,

41:14.560 --> 41:16.560
very good to me in the state of Ohio.

41:17.280 --> 41:17.600
Yeah.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.840
For a couple of days there, I was climbing the walls,

41:19.840 --> 41:21.760
but I'll tell you what it was.

41:21.760 --> 41:25.680
Uh, I read this article early on.

41:25.680 --> 41:27.600
You know who Scott Kelly is?

41:27.600 --> 41:28.880
You know, the astronaut?

41:28.880 --> 41:29.040
No.

41:29.040 --> 41:30.640
He's an astronaut, right?

41:30.640 --> 41:31.840
He's that astronaut.

41:31.840 --> 41:32.400
Thank you.

41:32.400 --> 41:33.280
Thanks, Travis.

41:35.680 --> 41:39.520
He was, he is the man that has spent the longest,

41:39.520 --> 41:41.920
the human that has spent the longest time in space.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.440
Look at us all out here now.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.360
It could be pretty like locked in,

41:45.360 --> 41:47.600
but when you're on the space station.

41:48.320 --> 41:48.880
Right.

41:48.880 --> 41:51.520
The interesting thing was the common sense things

41:51.520 --> 41:53.520
he put out there kind of calmed me down

41:53.520 --> 41:56.320
and it made me think of long sailing voyages that I did.

41:56.320 --> 41:57.680
And that's exactly what I did,

41:57.680 --> 42:00.880
because like when I used to do long trips,

42:00.880 --> 42:04.400
you know, you know, thousand miles or so down from Newport

42:05.360 --> 42:09.680
to British Virgin Islands or to St. Barts or from Lauderdale,

42:09.680 --> 42:12.720
still a long trip, you know, and you're on your own out there.

42:13.360 --> 42:16.560
So the way it usually started out was a party at the dock

42:16.560 --> 42:20.080
and you got a little drunk and you were hungover when you left

42:20.080 --> 42:23.120
and they go, and it pretty much never,

42:23.120 --> 42:28.160
uh, never ceased to fail that something major on your boat would break

42:28.160 --> 42:30.800
or a huge storm would hit you in the first day or two

42:30.800 --> 42:32.800
while you're still trying to get over your hangover.

42:33.440 --> 42:36.080
And there are times probably I was weeping to myself,

42:36.080 --> 42:38.000
but I should be back on shore eating eggs,

42:38.000 --> 42:38.880
vented into the force.

42:38.880 --> 42:40.720
He said, why am I out here?

42:40.720 --> 42:44.240
Then you have to kind of slap yourself in the face and go,

42:44.960 --> 42:47.920
hey, get it together and get in the groove.

42:48.560 --> 42:49.200
And you do.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.400
I just want to say, Dr. Buffett,

42:52.400 --> 42:56.720
this might go completely against your entire ethos,

42:56.720 --> 43:00.080
but the idea of being hungover on a boat during a storm

43:00.080 --> 43:03.200
sounds like the worst thing in the world to me.

43:03.200 --> 43:05.120
This is the worst thing I can imagine.

43:05.120 --> 43:06.800
No, there's something worse.

43:08.560 --> 43:11.200
Hungover on stage in front of 10,000 people.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.280
I don't do that anymore.

43:15.280 --> 43:17.760
Listen, that was one of the, please, baby Jesus,

43:17.760 --> 43:20.080
if you let the adrenaline get in here and let me get through this,

43:20.080 --> 43:22.320
I swear to God, I will never do this again.

43:23.840 --> 43:27.200
That happened at about 50, and I haven't done it since.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.120
So we have a few more, like a decade and a half of good,

43:31.120 --> 43:33.040
hard living ahead of us before we have to.

43:33.760 --> 43:35.040
Yeah, don't go there yet.

43:35.040 --> 43:36.560
I'm not saying stop today.

43:38.480 --> 43:43.680
Hey, it has been seven years since you've released a studio record.

43:43.680 --> 43:47.280
I think Songs for Sale Somewhere was the last one.

43:47.280 --> 43:51.840
Why, and now you are back with Life on the Flip side.

43:53.040 --> 43:56.560
How do you know when it's time for you to put out a record?

43:56.560 --> 43:58.320
Do you wait till you have enough songs, you decide,

43:58.320 --> 44:02.960
yeah, I got to sit down and focus on this long enough to do one?

44:03.600 --> 44:07.680
You know what, Justin, it's a little bit of both because,

44:07.680 --> 44:12.400
you know, I was having a lot of fun being Jimmy,

44:12.400 --> 44:15.280
but in the meantime, there was work going on,

44:15.280 --> 44:18.880
which was the musical that took a lot of time.

44:18.880 --> 44:23.120
And that was the first four months of the year and then touring.

44:23.120 --> 44:27.120
And then we were immediately into preparing it for the road.

44:27.120 --> 44:31.600
So between that and then all of a sudden jumping into the Kygo world

44:31.600 --> 44:36.880
and becoming what they anointed me, the godfather of Tropical House,

44:36.880 --> 44:38.480
I enjoyed playing around in there.

44:38.480 --> 44:44.080
So I was kind of, you know, my creative stuff is going in those directions.

44:44.080 --> 44:47.600
And, you know, before that, other things were doing it.

44:47.600 --> 44:53.200
And then it's the time flies, then you went, damn, it's been seven years.

44:53.200 --> 44:55.840
And we were starting to write and I had some pretty good songs.

44:55.840 --> 44:58.480
And we, you know, it was a great thing.

44:58.480 --> 45:01.200
But the Coral River Band, we loved being in the studio.

45:01.200 --> 45:06.320
I mean, some of the best times I ever played music was in that studio with my band

45:06.320 --> 45:08.880
because we built that little studio in Key West.

45:08.880 --> 45:10.800
And that's kind of our little magic spot.

45:10.800 --> 45:16.960
And so we went, hell yeah, let's concentrate for the rest of the time on writing

45:16.960 --> 45:19.280
and go in in January and do a record.

45:19.280 --> 45:20.400
Let's see what it does.

45:20.400 --> 45:28.080
You know, we've always, when we made an album, it wasn't trying to get famous or get successful.

45:28.080 --> 45:29.280
Thank God that's happened.

45:29.280 --> 45:31.120
So I don't have anything to prove out there.

45:31.120 --> 45:35.680
But we just wanted to make a record that, you know, if you liked what we do,

45:35.680 --> 45:37.200
you can add this to your collection.

45:37.200 --> 45:42.080
So that was the driving force. And when we got into it, we, you know,

45:42.080 --> 45:46.160
as you do something like that, I wasn't working on any other things

45:46.160 --> 45:49.040
and I concentrated for the last seven months on writing songs.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.280
We don't have like a specific like question from the audience

45:53.280 --> 45:56.400
like we usually do for these guest segments.

45:56.400 --> 45:57.920
Is anybody listening?

45:57.920 --> 46:02.400
There's a small diehard contingent of fans.

46:02.400 --> 46:05.760
You can't keep a fan base with quality music.

46:05.760 --> 46:08.000
You can't keep a fan base with quarantine.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.320
Well, they've all realized they could be baking bread

46:10.320 --> 46:11.760
instead of listening to our show.

46:11.760 --> 46:13.360
And they're like, wait, this is more interesting.

46:13.360 --> 46:15.760
Yeah, they've all picked up new hobbies and left us behind.

46:15.760 --> 46:17.280
But that kind of goes into the question.

46:17.280 --> 46:20.640
We also had Liz Gilbert on the show during this quarantine

46:20.640 --> 46:21.920
and sort of talked to her about the same thing.

46:21.920 --> 46:27.040
And I'm curious your thoughts like how you remain creative,

46:27.040 --> 46:31.440
like how you are sort of fostering that part of yourself in the midst of all of this.

46:31.440 --> 46:32.960
Because I know there's like a lot of our listeners

46:32.960 --> 46:34.160
who have all this time in their hands

46:34.160 --> 46:36.160
and feel like they should be using it to make something,

46:36.160 --> 46:42.000
but don't really are finding it tough to sort of get up the guts to actually do it.

46:43.040 --> 46:46.560
You know, I've missed a few days, but I've been pretty true to it.

46:46.560 --> 46:53.840
And that is the first thing is, you know, to look at how we can keep our fan base,

46:53.840 --> 46:57.440
which already was up there like looking at our Wednesday and Saturday shows.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.280
You know, we were a little bit ahead of the curve there

46:59.840 --> 47:02.720
with Margaritaville TV and Radio Margaritaville

47:02.720 --> 47:04.880
because we, you know, we can't go out.

47:04.880 --> 47:06.560
Everybody kind of gathered there.

47:07.120 --> 47:08.880
And so we had a locked in audience.

47:08.880 --> 47:10.400
And so we wanted to entertain them.

47:10.400 --> 47:12.000
So we've been, that was one thing.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.360
And we're still doing that.

47:14.080 --> 47:22.160
And the other thing was I started playing guitar more and going over jazz chords.

47:23.280 --> 47:24.400
Oh, really?

47:24.400 --> 47:25.200
Yeah.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.120
And I got, well, I got this guitar.

47:27.120 --> 47:27.920
I don't have it here.

47:27.920 --> 47:32.960
But the people at Benedetto that make these beautiful jazz guitars.

47:32.960 --> 47:35.760
You know, they started in Italy, but they're made in Savannah, Georgia.

47:35.760 --> 47:37.360
And they were going to make me one.

47:37.360 --> 47:38.720
And the factory shut down.

47:38.720 --> 47:39.920
And I had a loaner.

47:39.920 --> 47:40.880
So I still got it.

47:40.880 --> 47:42.160
And it's this beautiful guitar.

47:42.160 --> 47:44.880
So I had this great Benedetto jazz guitar.

47:45.520 --> 47:49.360
Thank you, Howard Paul, who's the CEO.

47:49.360 --> 47:51.840
And, you know, they're waiting to go back to work too.

47:52.400 --> 47:55.040
So I've got this beautiful jazz guitar.

47:55.040 --> 47:58.240
And, you know, I'm not a big jazz player.

47:58.240 --> 47:59.520
But I love listening to it.

47:59.520 --> 48:03.920
So I started playing a little, looking for some little augmented sevenths and chords

48:03.920 --> 48:04.720
as I was writing.

48:04.720 --> 48:05.680
I had this guitar.

48:05.680 --> 48:11.440
So I'm doing like an hour a day of just playing guitar and also an hour a day of French.

48:11.440 --> 48:15.360
Because, you know, I speak fairly good French.

48:15.360 --> 48:16.400
But this is a good time.

48:16.960 --> 48:19.120
And I'm doing better now because I'm doing it a lot.

48:19.120 --> 48:21.040
I go up on a podcast and talk to people.

48:21.040 --> 48:25.440
And I'm reading The Little Prince in French.

48:25.440 --> 48:28.720
Have you thought about releasing a French jazz album?

48:28.720 --> 48:29.520
There you go.

48:29.520 --> 48:30.800
Really alienate everybody.

48:32.160 --> 48:34.560
How did that not cross my mind?

48:34.560 --> 48:35.280
I don't.

48:35.280 --> 48:36.880
Listen, I would buy it.

48:36.880 --> 48:40.160
You call it James Buffay Presents.

48:40.160 --> 48:40.880
And then you make it.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.440
I mean, I would listen to the hell out of that.

48:43.440 --> 48:49.440
Jimmy, as someone who's been to several of your concerts and has heard people just sing

48:49.440 --> 48:54.640
along with every word, I would fucking adore one night to hear you be like, hey, everybody,

48:54.640 --> 48:57.200
I'm just going to groove for the next 30 minutes.

48:57.200 --> 49:02.560
I'm just going to sit here and just kind of noodle on some of this.

49:02.560 --> 49:04.000
You all know French, right?

49:04.000 --> 49:05.440
OK, just follow along.

49:05.440 --> 49:06.560
You know French and jazz, Gordon.

49:06.560 --> 49:09.120
You want to see an audience move out quick, you know?

49:10.800 --> 49:13.120
Concessions and merch sales are going to spike.

49:14.800 --> 49:18.240
Just inject some of that into your most beloved songs.

49:18.240 --> 49:22.800
Just start singing a chorus of Margaritaville in French.

49:22.800 --> 49:23.440
It's like, what?

49:24.720 --> 49:25.200
Let's see.

49:26.480 --> 49:29.440
Wasted Away would be Nippon Tancourt.

49:29.440 --> 49:30.880
It'd be, who cares?

49:30.880 --> 49:33.760
Nippon Tancourt and Margaritaville.

49:33.760 --> 49:34.560
That's good.

49:34.560 --> 49:35.200
I like that.

49:35.680 --> 49:36.160
Yeah.

49:36.160 --> 49:39.600
Je besoin une grande vase de sel.

49:40.800 --> 49:41.520
All right.

49:41.520 --> 49:42.400
Yeah, I love it.

49:42.400 --> 49:50.080
Quelque chose en dite en femme, c'est moi en faute.

49:50.080 --> 49:50.880
There you go.

49:50.880 --> 49:52.800
You can just cut that out by Spotify.

49:52.800 --> 49:54.160
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.520
We've got something here.

49:55.520 --> 49:56.320
Oh, here we go.

49:56.320 --> 49:56.880
Oh, here we go.

49:56.880 --> 49:57.680
Lay it down, OK.

49:58.240 --> 50:00.080
All right, jazz cards.

50:00.080 --> 50:00.800
OK, let's do it.

50:00.800 --> 50:01.040
OK.

50:01.040 --> 50:11.360
OK, where's my song?

50:20.480 --> 50:21.520
This is great.

50:21.520 --> 50:22.480
This is good, though.

50:22.480 --> 50:23.440
This sounds really good.

50:23.440 --> 50:26.000
That hit Jimmy Buffett's single, Where's My Song.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.600
18,000 people out quick.

50:27.600 --> 50:29.600
OK.

50:29.600 --> 50:32.400
Listen, you might have to start in much smaller clubs for a while.

50:32.400 --> 50:33.680
Yeah, you got to build back up.

50:33.680 --> 50:36.640
Oh, James Buffett could be your Chris Gaines.

50:36.640 --> 50:37.200
What do you think?

50:37.200 --> 50:38.240
Oh, my god.

50:38.240 --> 50:40.240
Don't even talk about Chris Gaines.

50:42.000 --> 50:42.320
I know.

50:42.320 --> 50:44.000
Finally, somebody speak it out.

50:44.000 --> 50:48.720
You were such a fan and so heartbroken when that phase of his career was so short lived.

50:48.720 --> 50:52.400
I'll never forget when Jimmy Buffett found out that it was just Garth Brooks the whole time.

50:52.400 --> 50:53.680
He was crushed.

50:53.680 --> 50:57.520
Hey, before we let you go, Jimmy, one last thing.

50:57.520 --> 51:02.320
Justin, I think of you as we've talked about your heart rate before in detail.

51:03.040 --> 51:04.960
This can be a stressful time.

51:04.960 --> 51:06.240
We've talked about keeping busy.

51:06.800 --> 51:09.360
What would be your advice for people that are feeling stressed,

51:09.360 --> 51:11.840
feeling kind of pent up and losing it?

51:11.840 --> 51:14.240
How do you how do you how do people keep calm?

51:15.440 --> 51:20.960
Well, you know, I think that keep a little bit busy, but do something, you know,

51:20.960 --> 51:25.760
and do something, you know, like reading to me.

51:25.760 --> 51:30.240
I mean, if you start there and you don't have the ability to get out or do anything else,

51:30.240 --> 51:35.600
read good books, you know, and if you're not a reader, start reading because it can take you there.

51:35.600 --> 51:36.320
It really can.

51:36.320 --> 51:40.160
We all know that, you know, to me, great writers read and listen, you know,

51:41.680 --> 51:43.680
and that's where I start first at reading.

51:43.680 --> 51:49.520
I mean, if that was basic, you know, and then if you got room, get a paper,

51:49.520 --> 51:51.600
get a room, get a ping pong table.

51:54.000 --> 51:54.500
Okay.

51:55.680 --> 51:58.800
Jimmy, this is the second time you've recommended reading on our show,

51:58.800 --> 52:01.200
and I'm so I can't I'm so fed up.

52:01.200 --> 52:03.280
It's the it's the least you want to read.

52:03.280 --> 52:03.600
Okay.

52:03.600 --> 52:04.000
Okay.

52:04.000 --> 52:04.880
Forget reading.

52:06.480 --> 52:09.200
I'm going to cut that out and make my ring tone just now.

52:09.200 --> 52:09.920
I'll tell you what.

52:09.920 --> 52:11.440
Let's get back to the ping pong table.

52:11.440 --> 52:11.680
Okay.

52:12.720 --> 52:13.120
Thank you.

52:14.480 --> 52:17.520
The Buffett family are all ping pong players, except my wife.

52:17.520 --> 52:20.560
My kids and I, and even my dogs can chase the ball, right?

52:20.560 --> 52:21.280
My dogs are here.

52:21.280 --> 52:21.840
You want to see them?

52:22.560 --> 52:22.800
Yes.

52:26.000 --> 52:26.400
Watch this.

52:26.400 --> 52:27.520
Let me see if this will work.

52:27.520 --> 52:28.480
Wait, let's see.

52:29.280 --> 52:30.800
Hey, Gracielola, beach.

52:30.800 --> 52:31.520
Want to go to the beach?

52:34.240 --> 52:35.200
They're unmoved.

52:35.200 --> 52:36.320
Nothing's happened, Jimmy.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.040
How about this?

52:37.040 --> 52:37.920
Tree, tree.

52:40.320 --> 52:41.520
I think they're asleep, Jimmy.

52:43.440 --> 52:45.520
Wait, Jimmy, those are stuffed dogs, pal.

52:45.520 --> 52:47.920
You've been in, you've been locked up for too long.

52:49.440 --> 52:50.800
Oh, they are stuffed dog.

52:50.800 --> 52:51.360
I forgot.

52:51.360 --> 52:52.400
No, no, no.

52:52.400 --> 52:52.720
No.

52:52.720 --> 52:53.040
Okay.

52:53.040 --> 52:54.720
The other, yeah, but they make little.

52:55.600 --> 52:59.840
My son has one in his apartment here and he showed it to me, but it's a little

52:59.840 --> 53:05.760
ping pong table that's got to be maybe four feet by three feet that also pops

53:05.760 --> 53:10.320
open and it has little pool cues hitting and you can shoot pool on it.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.680
They don't cost much either.

53:11.680 --> 53:12.000
Yeah.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.640
I know something that people could do to help with their anxiety.

53:14.640 --> 53:18.000
And that is to pick up a life on the flip side.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.920
The new studio album by Jimmy Buffett.

53:21.360 --> 53:22.640
I was about to say in stores.

53:22.640 --> 53:23.520
Don't do that.

53:23.520 --> 53:29.520
It's just, you know, buy it on, on, on the internet, wherever fine albums are sold.

53:31.520 --> 53:32.640
Where's that these days?

53:33.200 --> 53:33.440
Yeah.

53:33.440 --> 53:33.840
Okay.

53:33.840 --> 53:34.640
Well, fair enough.

53:34.640 --> 53:35.200
I don't know.

53:35.200 --> 53:36.480
I'm a podcast guy, Jimmy.

53:36.480 --> 53:37.040
I don't know.

53:37.040 --> 53:38.160
We give our stuff out for free.

53:40.960 --> 53:43.760
But thank you so much for joining us as, as always.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.840
It is, is a treat and a delight.

53:47.120 --> 53:47.360
Yeah.

53:47.360 --> 53:47.840
Well, thanks.

53:47.840 --> 53:49.360
I'll just stay in touch with you guys.

53:49.360 --> 53:49.920
And always.

53:49.920 --> 53:53.840
I love listening to the show and best everybody out there.

53:53.840 --> 53:57.040
And, uh, hopefully you'll get back on the road too.

53:57.040 --> 54:00.640
When you do, it'll be a big, big, they'll be ready for you.

54:01.200 --> 54:04.480
Co-headliners, the tour America's been waiting for.

54:05.120 --> 54:07.840
You can open, you can open for us anytime.

54:08.400 --> 54:08.960
Yeah.

54:08.960 --> 54:10.720
I was going to say the same to you, Jimmy.

54:10.720 --> 54:10.880
Yeah.

54:10.880 --> 54:11.840
Let's not, let's not worry about the building.

54:11.840 --> 54:14.400
It'll be a competition between that and, and your, uh,

54:14.400 --> 54:17.120
French jazz to see who can clear the place out the quickest.

54:20.320 --> 54:21.920
You're the one that made me do that.

54:21.920 --> 54:22.480
You guys.

54:22.480 --> 54:22.960
Yeah.

54:22.960 --> 54:23.440
Y'all are.

54:23.440 --> 54:24.240
You did great.

54:25.440 --> 54:26.720
I liked yours.

54:26.720 --> 54:27.440
All right.

54:27.440 --> 54:28.400
Thanks, Jimmy.

54:28.400 --> 54:28.880
Fins up.

54:28.880 --> 54:29.120
All right.

54:29.120 --> 54:29.840
Thanks guys.

54:29.840 --> 54:30.640
Always great.

54:30.640 --> 54:31.600
Great to see you.

54:31.600 --> 54:32.480
Stay safe.

54:32.480 --> 54:32.800
Bye.

54:34.160 --> 54:35.040
Here is a question.

54:36.000 --> 54:41.120
I'm in the process of writing a fairly serious fantasy novel set in classic olden times.

54:41.120 --> 54:41.520
Yeah.

54:41.520 --> 54:42.480
My problem is this.

54:42.480 --> 54:45.760
What is the best word to use when referring to a character's butt?

54:45.760 --> 54:47.200
This is a fairly serious scene.

54:47.200 --> 54:51.520
So I don't want to sound anachronistic or suggestive at the same time.

54:51.520 --> 54:54.720
I don't want to sound stuffy or puritanical.

54:54.720 --> 54:56.320
So what's my best option?

54:56.320 --> 54:58.800
That's from chasing tail words in Chattanooga.

55:00.160 --> 55:00.880
Clef.

55:00.880 --> 55:04.800
First off, I will say congratulations on being what I assume is the only fantasy

55:04.800 --> 55:06.400
author in Chattanooga.

55:06.400 --> 55:09.280
You're doing that's that's I don't even know.

55:09.280 --> 55:13.440
I don't even know how to begin diagnosing what that was a slam on what that was.

55:14.560 --> 55:19.520
Just didn't seem like you hear about a lot of a lot of fantasy authors from Chattanooga.

55:19.520 --> 55:21.120
I mean, there's probably not a lot.

55:21.120 --> 55:23.840
Why would you even why would you even say that?

55:23.840 --> 55:24.800
Just killing time.

55:24.800 --> 55:25.040
Okay.

55:25.040 --> 55:27.120
It's fucking mean though to Chattanooga.

55:27.120 --> 55:28.080
It's not mean.

55:28.080 --> 55:28.880
How is it mean?

55:28.880 --> 55:29.920
It's not even judgmental.

55:29.920 --> 55:33.440
It's mean to Chattanooga and the people who are writing fantasy.

55:33.440 --> 55:37.120
Why is it mean to Chattanooga to say that I don't think there's a lot of fantasy authors?

55:37.120 --> 55:41.600
I mean, it's maybe a mild burn, but you didn't even need to say it.

55:41.600 --> 55:43.440
You didn't even you didn't even need to.

55:43.440 --> 55:47.200
What's blowing me away is you didn't even need to be mean to Chattanooga.

55:47.200 --> 55:50.640
And I'm not being mean to Chattanooga to say there's not a lot of fantasy.

55:51.680 --> 55:54.480
Like, there's not a lot of serial killers from Huntington.

55:54.480 --> 55:58.880
Did you do your own census in Chattanooga done just by Justin McElroy?

55:58.880 --> 56:02.960
Juice, I hope it was before COVID because that's a lot of human exposure that you did

56:02.960 --> 56:05.760
when you went door to door asking who was fantasy novelist in Chattanooga.

56:05.760 --> 56:07.120
I'm not helping with this anymore.

56:07.120 --> 56:08.560
You guys come up with butt names on your own.

56:08.560 --> 56:09.440
I'm muting here.

56:09.440 --> 56:13.280
So I've got some synonyms for butt here.

56:13.920 --> 56:14.080
Yeah.

56:15.200 --> 56:15.920
Backside.

56:17.120 --> 56:18.080
Backside.

56:18.080 --> 56:20.720
Okay, but let's set the terminology here.

56:20.720 --> 56:21.760
Justin, please come back.

56:22.400 --> 56:24.080
It's not my fault you were mean to Chattanooga.

56:24.080 --> 56:26.640
So you can't take this out on both of us because you realize how

56:26.640 --> 56:28.080
shitty you are being to Chattanooga.

56:28.080 --> 56:29.440
Travis and Griffin, as usual.

56:30.080 --> 56:30.640
It's not a beat.

56:30.640 --> 56:31.840
I've muted myself out.

56:31.840 --> 56:35.600
It's not a problem, but it's just fucking Travis and, you know, the classic stuff.

56:36.320 --> 56:37.760
Yeah, I was dunking on Chattanooga.

56:38.560 --> 56:40.240
This is the usual shit.

56:40.240 --> 56:41.120
Yeah, I hate it too.

56:41.120 --> 56:43.600
Who do you think he's talking to Griffin?

56:43.600 --> 56:46.800
It's a shit ball talent no fantasy authors go to.

56:46.800 --> 56:47.680
All right.

56:47.680 --> 56:50.480
That's why I'm surprised there's not more fantasy authors

56:50.480 --> 56:52.640
just so they can pretend to be anywhere else.

56:52.640 --> 56:54.160
He probably called John Scalzi.

56:55.600 --> 56:56.400
John Scalzi.

56:57.360 --> 56:57.920
I didn't hear.

56:57.920 --> 57:01.440
No, nobody's talking about John Scalzi.

57:01.440 --> 57:02.000
Why would you-

57:02.000 --> 57:03.440
Sweetheart, why would you say John Scalzi?

57:03.440 --> 57:04.720
There's nobody talking about John Scalzi.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.440
Yeah, Old Man Swore is dope though.

57:07.440 --> 57:08.160
You're right.

57:08.160 --> 57:09.040
Dairy Error.

57:09.680 --> 57:11.280
Dairy Error is funny.

57:11.280 --> 57:12.160
I mean, that's the thing.

57:12.160 --> 57:12.640
Are you trying-

57:12.640 --> 57:16.320
When you're doing this serious sexual fantasy novel, are you trying to-

57:16.320 --> 57:17.440
Is it like a funny scene?

57:18.320 --> 57:19.920
They said it's a fairly serious scene.

57:19.920 --> 57:25.120
So that probably rules out Tushy, which the thesaurus.com recommended.

57:25.120 --> 57:26.720
Now let me throw this out.

57:26.720 --> 57:28.640
Haunches.

57:28.640 --> 57:29.040
Fuck.

57:29.040 --> 57:32.560
See, I should have stayed muted because I was going to use haunches.

57:32.560 --> 57:33.920
That was my haunch.

57:33.920 --> 57:38.800
Like, he showed his haunch to them in a serious way.

57:38.800 --> 57:40.560
What about his cleft?

57:40.560 --> 57:42.080
Which I said earlier, I understand why.

57:42.080 --> 57:43.120
His bottom cleft.

57:44.720 --> 57:47.760
I want to know what is the scene, okay.

57:47.760 --> 57:52.000
What is the scene that's not funny and it's not suggestive,

57:52.000 --> 57:55.680
it's just a regular serious scene about butts?

57:55.680 --> 57:56.640
Yeah.

57:56.640 --> 57:59.680
Oh, it's sexual, like he takes off his pants and-

57:59.680 --> 58:02.000
No, does not want them to be suggestive.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.280
So it's not sexual.

58:03.280 --> 58:04.240
This is fairly serious.

58:04.240 --> 58:14.160
Oh, so like he is being stripped nude to be brought before the King's Court Council.

58:14.720 --> 58:15.680
The official butt.

58:15.680 --> 58:16.880
Oh, then it's keister.

58:17.600 --> 58:18.640
His keister, no.

58:19.280 --> 58:19.920
No, that's not-

58:19.920 --> 58:22.880
I'm the KBI, I'm the King's Butt Inspector.

58:22.880 --> 58:23.760
Fanny?

58:23.760 --> 58:26.560
I'm the FBI, the fiefdom butt inspector.

58:29.120 --> 58:29.440
Is it-

58:29.440 --> 58:35.280
The problem is, the only thing that I'm seeing that I think like is fairly serious is like bottom.

58:35.280 --> 58:38.400
But that just sounds like so infantile.

58:38.400 --> 58:41.200
What about, ooh, posterior?

58:41.840 --> 58:42.160
No.

58:42.160 --> 58:42.480
No.

58:42.480 --> 58:43.200
What's wrong with that?

58:43.200 --> 58:43.760
Sounds like a grandpa.

58:44.400 --> 58:45.120
Overly clinical.

58:45.120 --> 58:50.800
A big thing that authors like to do whenever they're talking about somebody's privates

58:50.800 --> 58:56.560
or back privates is they will say, they will use like metaphor and be like, his big pumpkin.

58:58.480 --> 58:59.360
Yeah, yeah.

58:59.360 --> 59:00.400
And it like, if I were to-

59:00.400 --> 59:01.120
They do that all the-

59:01.120 --> 59:03.360
You're right, Griffin, all the time, I'm seeing that.

59:03.360 --> 59:10.800
The King's Counselor stripped the bad night of his clothes and exposed his wormy and his big

59:10.800 --> 59:11.680
pumpkin.

59:11.680 --> 59:15.920
Then I think people would know which one is the penis and which one is the butt, right?

59:16.640 --> 59:17.200
Yeah.

59:17.200 --> 59:18.640
Hey guys, we're all adults here.

59:18.640 --> 59:20.960
We all know what the big pumpkin is.

59:20.960 --> 59:24.400
Yeah, it's what Linus worships.

59:24.400 --> 59:25.920
Now let me throw this out.

59:27.280 --> 59:32.800
You need to maybe add a gerund in there that will make it seem more serious and fantasy

59:32.800 --> 59:33.120
and stuff.

59:33.120 --> 59:38.240
So if you say like, exposing his quivering cheeks, right?

59:38.240 --> 59:39.920
Now it's like, ooh, that's some writing.

59:40.400 --> 59:42.160
You can't just say, exposing his butt.

59:42.160 --> 59:43.120
That's nothing, right?

59:43.120 --> 59:51.360
That's just, that's first draft, exposing his, all I can come up with is quivering cheeks.

59:52.640 --> 59:56.960
I mean, you could just say his big fat ass.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.200
His juicy dumper.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.440
No, no, not his juicy dumper.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.200
Dumper is not the right vibe.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:13.200
I think just saying like, he takes off his pants before the king's council and reveals

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.720
his big, his fat ass.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.880
Then people are going to read that and like, it may catch him off guard, but they'll be

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.280
like, oh, this is a character development trait I didn't know about.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:23.120
But now when I think about them, I am going to think about-

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.200
Explains a lot of their choices.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.240
It explains a lot.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.600
And like that fight scene that I envisioned earlier when I was reading the words and like

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.200
trying to figure out what it looked like in my mind.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:35.840
Now that I know that he's packing heat in them Jordashes, like then it's going to change

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.840
a lot of what that fight looks like.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.360
It makes so much sense because the entire book, they've been carrying themselves like

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.880
someone with a fat ass.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.440
And I never imagined it.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.200
I thought he was just kind of full of himself and a little bit of a bragger, but it turns

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.120
out, no, he got that fat ass.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.800
When he kills a dragon with a spear and you know that he's got some heave and Levi's

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.960
in there, then you are going to think about the fight in a different way is all I'm saying.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.760
And you know, and I know what you're saying question, I was like, I don't want it to be

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.080
funny.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.160
So let me give you this suggestion.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:06.880
A lot of the times as a reader, I don't know if something is supposed to be like what the

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.960
tone is to see until someone else responds to it.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.720
So here's what I suggest.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:18.080
He removed his pantaloons before the inspector revealing his fat ass.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.840
And then you have the inspector say, well, this is very serious.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.560
That's a serious ass.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.520
Well, I see.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.080
This is a serious chunk of back meat.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.760
Nothing funny about that ass.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.000
Just a regular fat ass.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.240
Those are two serious butt cheeks.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.560
Well, witcher, this is a very serious ass you've brought before us.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.400
I must speak with the council to decide how to deal with that ass.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.420
Witcher!

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.400
Witcher!

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.360
Well, bounce a coin off your witcher's ass.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.320
O Valley of Plenty.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:53.680

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:28.640
anything, but it's still great.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.680
Still worth a listen.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.560

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.120
and resplendent pin, both of those from the Adventure Zone, and the proceeds of which

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.400
are going to the Trevor Project.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.600
So make sure to check those out.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.360
What else, boys?

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.440
Yeah, check out also the Foundation for Black Women's Wellness.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:06.080
We'll have a link to that in the episode description.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.920
And think about supporting them also.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.480
Yeah.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.160
Did we thank John Roderick in The Long Winters?

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:13.440
No, because-

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.560
For the use of the Zoom time off, it's a departure off the album within a day.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.840
The one and the same.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.440
Thanks, John in The Long Winters.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.880
Do y'all want that final?

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:21.760
Yes, please.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.480
Yeah, absolutely.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.400
Well, let me fucking find it.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.280
Okay.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.840
Hold the fucking phone.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.000
Here's another Emma Cant Joint to close us out.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:32.800
Thank you, Emma.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:35.200
It's from Yahoo Answers user Samantha, who asks,

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.720
can you get a tongue piercing if your tongue isn't healthy?

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.000
Oh, boy.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:45.920
Oh, boy.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.560
Oh, boy.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:49.760
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.680
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:52.400
I'm Griffin Mac.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.120
Is that too gross?

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.160
Should I do a different one?

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.360
No, you already said it.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.560
This has been my brother and me.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.080
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.080
Kiss your dad square on the lips.
