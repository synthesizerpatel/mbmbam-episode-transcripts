00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go when you're feeling down.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds come into your dream, take a chance on me.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
Like Chilean miners emerging from the ground, so does our wisdom bubble up to the surface and say to you,

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
Hey, it's time to grow. Come grow with us. We're my brother, my brother and me.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
We're an advice cast for the modern era.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
Did you guys watch all the footage of those Chilean miners getting over it?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I saw one. I was like, I get it.

01:11.000 --> 01:19.000
I don't know why the entire time I was watching all 33 of those men be pulled from the loam.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
All I could think about was, fuck yeah, America. We got in there and we did it.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
We didn't have to do it. We just got in there and we got them all out.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
I think it was a real buzzkill though when the last one popped up and saw a shadow and went back down.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
And now we got six more weeks of winter.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
I'm glad they all survived because now we can make jokes about it.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
If they hadn't, it wouldn't have been as funny.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
No.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Well, it would have been as funny later, but not now.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
It wouldn't have been funny.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
So our show, My Brother, My Brother and Me, is an advice show for the modern era.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
We take your questions.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
We think about them. We chew on them all week.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah, a lot of people think we just read them and then make up stuff.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
We really mull these over.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
So let's take on the first question that we've carefully considered.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
As always, if you have a question or a friend has a question, we love to get them.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
We ran a little light this week.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
So if you've got a good one, send it in to us.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
The more challenging, the better.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
FormSpring asks, is it okay to sneak glances at the cleavage of women who are sitting down on the subway while I'm standing?

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I'm over six feet tall, so I have a good height advantage.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
It's a victimless crime, right?

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Brian in a major metro area.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
It is actually, that crime does have a victim.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
It is a victimful crime, I believe.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
I think it is your God-given right.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Okay, okay, no.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
How are things in Mad Men world?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah, really.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
How is 1960?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Did you hear about Kennedy?

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
I think it's one of those things where as long as you can accept that they totally know you're doing it.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
There's never been a dude who's like ninja-like scoped out a chase cleavage and she wasn't aware of it.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
And you've never, and let's say that no one's ever scooped a peak of cleavage down a turtleneck.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
It's a two-way street, okay?

03:21.000 --> 03:31.000
I think the thing is to be like, it's a fine line between grabbing a peak, that's what a cool kid does, and grabbing a leer.

03:31.000 --> 03:39.000
You've got to get that smooth, smooth Roger Dodger glance out the periphery down.

03:39.000 --> 03:47.000
If you haven't seen Roger Dodger, you need to, especially if you're in high school.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
It'll change your world in a lot of ways.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
It's got a Facebook in it.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
It does have, it has Jimmy Facebook.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
Kid Facebook and Johnny Zombieland.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Kid's good.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
George C. Scott's son.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
It's an awesome man movie.

04:07.000 --> 04:15.000
But it'll teach you about how to do things like this without being a total monster about it.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
The thing is, you biologically are going to do it.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
The thing is, don't be a creep.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Yeah, don't be a weird beard.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
And always wear sunglasses.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Always wear giant sunglasses to protect you.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Novelty-sized.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Yeah.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
If you do do it, if you can change your face into the face of a wolf, and then like a big cartoon wolf face,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
and then let out like a howl while stomping your foot.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
A wooga, a wooga.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
That's good too.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
If you make your eyeballs shoot, you know, one to two feet out of your head.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
This is a good opportunity actually to build some self-confidence if you do it properly,

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
because you can get in there for a look, burn it into your mind.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Just burn it into your mind.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
And then look away knowing you could look more, and it's a big self-confidence booster.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
You say, wow.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Wow, Justin.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
What restraint.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Yep.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
What restraint you're showing.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
You're like a Zen master.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
And you're not a creepy weirdo.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
If you had restraint when you not do it in the first place.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
You're saying once you get a sampling, once you get a sampling of it.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Get a sampling.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
And then you're like, it's like when you go into Cold Stone and you're like,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
let me try the peanut butter chocolate hoedown.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
And then they give you a little spoonful of it.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And you're like, you know what, fuck this.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
And then you flip the spoon at them and you walk out.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
That's insane.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
I'm going to go get some yogurt.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
I was going to make that exact same analogy with that exact same flavor of ice cream.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Oh, wow.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
I guess I'm not the only fan of this made up ice cream flavor.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
My friends, no, sorry.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Let me start again.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Good start.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
My wife's best friend sucks.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Oh, David.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Infidelity is not the secret to a happy marriage.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
All she does is critique the, oh, not that.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Okay.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
All she does is critique things and she is way too negative and she disagrees with everything I say.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
Every time we're together, it's like she's competing with me on who knows my wife better.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Also, she always has to one up what I have to say.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
I usually ignore her and I don't indulge her, but sometimes she just pushes way too many buttons.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
I am never flat out mean to her, but I'm reaching my breaking point.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
Is there any way to handle the situation without being mean?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Oh, David.

06:23.000 --> 06:34.000
I'm starting to get the impression that like half of the questions we get have something to do with a friend of a friend or a friend of a brother or a friend of a wife.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
Just like a second hand acquaintance who just sucks and nobody knows how to deal with them.

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
We should like start some kind of service where we roll up in a van and we just take that person away.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
I'm not hurt.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
No, not hurt.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Just take them away and leave them in a cornfield somewhere.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Yeah.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
Dazed and confused and spin them around a couple of times and then just leave them there with a bottle of water and a granola bar.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Pretty sure that's a federal crime, what you just described.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
That is kidnapping, yes.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Technically.

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
To quote Spice Girls, if you want to be her lover, you got to get with her friends.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Right.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I'm having déjà vu.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Have we answered this exact same question in this exact same way before?

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
No, I just think it's such a common problem because David and I might be going out on a limb here, but give me a chance.

07:23.000 --> 07:34.000
I think that a lot of the times that you have these problems where, you know, my wife's friend or my boyfriend's friend or whatever,

07:34.000 --> 07:45.000
I think it has to do with the fact that there's a dichotomy sometimes between who you are with your friends and who you are with your SO.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.000
And I think that sometimes that dichotomy can cause problems.

07:51.000 --> 08:06.000
I often said that the key to finding the best possible person for you is the person who you feel like you could be the same you around your friends and around them.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
And when you find that person, that's a really good indication that there's someone you can really build a life with.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
And it sounds like there might be a dichotomy here.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
And I'm not saying that like you and her are meant to be.

08:19.000 --> 08:27.000
I'm just saying that that can cause some real friction because a lot of times you're different people with your significant other and friends.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
I also think that if it really feels like she's competing with you, she probably is, dude.

08:33.000 --> 08:43.000
Like, she's probably, you know, this is her best friend and, you know, she's married now and she's probably feeling like she's losing her best friend and everything like that.

08:43.000 --> 08:57.000
So I think as far as taking care of it without being mean, I think the more you strive and this is going to feel counterintuitive, but the more you strive to include her in things and be pleasant with her and let her know that she's not getting cut out of the situation.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
You don't have to say it, but you have to show it and be like you're included.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
But at the same time, you also need to talk to your wife and be like, hun, your best friend is being a complete bitch.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
And either this needs to stop.

09:09.000 --> 09:17.000
Oh, don't say that. Why are you? Why not? You have to be upfront animal today.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
Part of the part of the problem is that you it's not just that you don't like the friend.

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
It's that you feel like the friend is competing with you for the affections of the person that is more important to you than anything.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Which she probably is. She probably is. Just eat that. Just eat it.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
You don't there's nothing you can do about it.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
Get confident. Say there's no way that you can move in on this special love that we have.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Oh, yeah. You've won, dude. You've got it over. Yeah, you won.

09:44.000 --> 09:52.000
So now you got to be a good sport and, you know, invite the second place finisher to hang out.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah, I have so many Yahoo answers questions that we've been at.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
The embarrassment of riches, right? I have been flooded in Yahoo answers questions.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
I think I'm going to kick it off with this one. This one was sent in by Thomas Reese.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
It's by Yahoo answers user. Love you. They sell out.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
That's the fight of salad. Yeah.

10:14.000 --> 10:20.000
Who asks help my water just broke, but I need to finish watching this hilarious movie on YouTube.

10:20.000 --> 10:27.000
Is there any is there any way to hold off labor for another hour? I really don't want to miss the ending.

10:27.000 --> 10:36.000
Additional details. I'm not missing the ending. I already had to miss the homecoming dance because of this babby.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
God, babies are such an inconvenience. They are. They are an inconvenience.

10:40.000 --> 10:48.000
The top answer is by Doc Mojave, who says, Get an iPhone and hurry. That's a pretty good suggestion, I guess.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Did he mean hurry to get an iPhone or hurry to go to the hospital?

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
I mean, those iPhones are selling out pretty quickly. Yeah, they're banging, right? They're huge.

10:56.000 --> 11:03.000
I would posit that maybe you should get your fucking shit together because you're about to give life to a human.

11:03.000 --> 11:12.000
That's going to be your responsibility. And YouTube movies, they can wait. You can finish that movie later.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
So often there's if it's a movie, like if someone just uploaded Save the Last Dance or something,

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
there's a copyright infringement claim while you're giving birth. I didn't think about that.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
Yeah, you see, you guys just can't. This is why I think about these ahead of time.

11:27.000 --> 11:33.000
This is why I did some legal research into Save the Last Dance and copyright holders and things like that.

11:33.000 --> 11:39.000
I'm reading more answers on this and people like nobody's saying the obvious thing, which is what the fuck is wrong with you.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
They're saying things like stick your feet in the air and elevate your hips. No.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
She said in other details, she's not missing the end of the movie. That is not an option.

11:48.000 --> 11:55.000
She's not looking for that option. She's looking for like a cork kind of solution.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
I love that she goes so far as to clarify that she's already missed the homecoming dance.

12:00.000 --> 12:06.000
And everyone knows the second biggest point in a young lady's life is that funny YouTube video.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
It's just balanced out. She's not missing that. She's already missed the homecoming dance.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
What movie is she watching? That takes an hour on YouTube.

12:15.000 --> 12:22.000
I don't understand. It's something historic. Oh, no, it's hilarious.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
Maybe it's about the clean miners. They're pretty funny.

12:26.000 --> 12:35.000
Boy, I don't know what to tell you other than. How late is a late term abortion?

12:35.000 --> 12:46.000
Like how does it go? What are you talking? You're talking like the six minutes till midnight.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
Which one is closer? Do they have YouTube at the abortion doctor's office?

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
Because if so, I think you might have a what? Oh, I finally get it.

12:55.000 --> 13:04.000
That she's watching is that is vampire suck. And that way she can have two abortions at once.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
There it was. Hey, I've got a question from the Internet.

13:10.000 --> 13:17.000
When my fiance and I get married this summer, we'll have been together over five years.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
Everyone says that any good couple will have their fights, but working through them is what makes the relationship last.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
However, I've never had a fight with my wife to be sure.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
We've argued over where to eat and things like that. But the relationship has been pretty much conflict free thus far.

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
Are we doomed? Is it true? We need to fight more addled in Ann Arbor. That's a good one.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
She hates you so much. She hates your guts in her heart of hearts in a deep down your heart of hearts.

13:44.000 --> 13:52.000
She hates your guts. She hates your ever loving guts. And you might hate her guts a little bit.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
Other than that, though, you're probably good. Listen, you're talking to three guys who are raised Baptist.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
Don't talk to us about stuff and your feelings deep, deep down and no one can ever find them. You put them right in that bottle.

14:02.000 --> 14:09.000
You cook that shit. You keep that in like a baby while you're watching YouTube.

14:09.000 --> 14:17.000
What does he use to say, Griffin? You stuff them down in a bottle and then you get a bigger bottle?

14:17.000 --> 14:23.000
You know what? I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
I think that there are some couples that just don't fight, and I don't think that's not I don't think that's too weird.

14:29.000 --> 14:37.000
I think that there are types of people who are just non confrontational and that when two of those people start dating, you know, it's normal for them not to fight.

14:37.000 --> 14:47.000
I will tell you, though, that and this isn't for better or for worse, but the tenor of your relationship will change after you get married,

14:47.000 --> 15:04.000
because the some of the things that you can sort of laugh off when you are not permanently hitched to this person for for your entire life become far more serious when you when you when you get married,

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
because then it becomes issues that affect both of you. And as as things happen.

15:11.000 --> 15:27.000
You will run into two problems. I think the only deficit you get from not fighting for this long is that when real conflicts do come up, you're not going to have a lot of experience with resolving them.

15:27.000 --> 15:34.000
So I guess what I'm saying is be more serious when you're picking a restaurant, like get a pros and cons list out and go to a relationship counselor.

15:34.000 --> 15:42.000
Yeah. Just next time. Next time you guys are arguing over where to eat, just fucking turn up the heat on that shit. Yeah. Yeah.

15:42.000 --> 15:49.000
You bitch. I will turn this car around and we are going to Applebee's.

15:49.000 --> 15:58.000
I think that the fact of the matter is, as long as you feel like you're not holding anything back, that you're saying everything, then you're good.

15:58.000 --> 16:06.000
I mean, only you can judge it. But that's a good point. Are you look down deep in you and see if there's if you're getting everything out?

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
Because a lot of times fights can be people can put them off.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
I know I do this by saying, well, that's not worth fighting about.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
My opinion isn't worth getting upset about.

16:20.000 --> 16:28.000
I guess I'm telling you, just be angrier, like get serious about this or maybe you just don't care at which point. That's great. That's fine.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
There's so many things in my life that I'm like, I could get. No, I don't care. I'm not worried about that. I'll worry about that later.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
You know, you know the people they are. They're the people who sit and they say, what do you want to have for dinner tonight?

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
You know, it says, what do you want to have for dinner? Yep. I don't care. What do you want to have?

16:42.000 --> 16:50.000
And then they eat their hands. Three hours later, they're like each other's hands. They eat each other's hands. Romance.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
Sweet, sweet romance. Let's do a Yahoo. This one's from Gun Blader sent this one in. Thank you.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
Thanks, Gun Blader. Yahoo answers user me.

17:00.000 --> 17:17.000
That's like eight I's and nine O's. They ask, how do I become a prostitute without my parents knowing? I really want to be a prostitute, but no way will my parents even think of it.

17:17.000 --> 17:31.000
Stuffy uptight parents. These parents nowadays. The first most important thing you need to do is memorize the fuck out of your dad's license plate number.

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
You do not want to make that that particular mistake. Holy shit.

17:37.000 --> 17:55.000
I guess you do it the same way you do anything that you don't want your parents to know that you're doing, although I imagine that there are more things to consider when you're hiding your prostitute lifestyle from your parents.

17:55.000 --> 18:07.000
Like the makeup, you got to take that off before morning before they drive you to school, right? Because they'll know if you get any shiners during the thing, it can happen. It can happen.

18:07.000 --> 18:14.000
You're going to have to come up with a solid excuse for that. You got to be you got to be careful about what lies you tell your parents as to what you're really doing.

18:14.000 --> 18:26.000
Because the last thing you want is your mom to confront you at the breakfast table and say, Debbie, why is it every time you come home from church group, you're walking like slim pickings like the inside of a whiskey bottle?

18:26.000 --> 18:35.000
I imagine the hardest thing to hide is probably forging the parents signature on the permission slip because pimps won't just take underage women.

18:35.000 --> 18:44.000
They have a lot. That's what I was just thinking about is how is how to introduce your pimp to your family without.

18:44.000 --> 18:53.000
Now, you say that Dr. Money Money here is your tutor. He's correct. What do you teach, Dr. Money Money?

18:53.000 --> 19:10.000
Oh, I do hard lessons. I see. Teach this bitch about the streets. I mean, pre-algebra sociology. What did I say? I'm sorry, Destiny. I mean, Debbie. Fuck. So, Dr. Money Money, is that a is that did you get a Ph.D. or is that like a medical?

19:10.000 --> 19:24.000
Yeah, Ph.D. in hard knocks. What? Nobody. Do pimps say things like hard knocks? Is that a thing pimps say? I'm not only only the old fashioned pimps talk about how it used to be.

19:24.000 --> 19:34.000
Tell your parents every time you go out hooking, tell your parents that you're going to science club. And then when you introduce your pimp to him, tell him it's an Android you invented.

19:34.000 --> 19:50.000
This is my Android, Dr. Money Money. Yo, what's up? He's so lifelike. In order for this this scenario to play out the way we've envisioned it, you need to have really stupid ass parents.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
To be fair, if you want to be a prostitute, I'm guessing that they're not doing a good job so far.

19:56.000 --> 20:07.000
I think for hooking advice on Yahoo Answers, they're probably not a brain trust. I just got sad all of a sudden.

20:07.000 --> 20:15.000
It went from being jovial to just kind of sad. That's really a person out there. That's a real person with that question on the Internet. They're looking for real advice.

20:15.000 --> 20:22.000
Oh, Griffin, prostitutes hurt people. Don't be silly. That's like saying chairs are people.

20:22.000 --> 20:29.000
Yeah, that's like saying chairs are people, which is appropriate because you sit on them.

20:29.000 --> 20:36.000
And they're made of wood. Don't you wish everyone still wore hats? Nope. Nope.

20:36.000 --> 20:43.000
I'd like to rock an awesome trilby, but I'm afraid of the ridicule. What should I do?

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
You've made the mistake of asking three guys who don't look good in hats.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
We're really anti-hat because our heads aren't big enough.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
We have long heads. That's a good way to describe it. Just big heads.

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
I wouldn't even say big as much as they're deep. We have deep, deep heads.

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
It's hard to put something on top of that without looking just silly.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
Whatever the reverse of a chasm is, we have that for heads.

21:14.000 --> 21:20.000
It's like putting a hat on a boat is pretty much what you're doing.

21:20.000 --> 21:27.000
You can't bend society to suit the fashion that you wish you could rock for yourself.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
There are only two ways to deal with this situation.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
You either get in line or you just start wearing that hat.

21:36.000 --> 21:45.000
What's the risk if you wear the hat of being like, what's up with hat guy here? Who does he think he is with this hat?

21:45.000 --> 21:51.000
The important question you have to ask yourself, because I was talking to someone about a similar situation last night.

21:51.000 --> 21:57.000
Are you the type of person who wants to wear a hat or are you the type of person who's meant to wear a hat?

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
If you are meant to wear a hat, then you wear the shit out of it.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
If you just want to wear a hat, then you're Billy Hat Guy and you don't want to be Billy Hat Guy.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
That's the thing. Once you put this hat on, once you start rocking an awesome trilby, which by the way, no such thing.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
Once you start doing that, that's what your whole world is about after that.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
That's what your whole situation is.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Oh, you were in the Peace Corps for two years? Tough fucking break.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
Nobody cares. You're Hat Man. You're Mr. Hat. You're Sergeant Hat.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
Dr. Hat, I would like to wear a cape.

22:29.000 --> 22:39.000
Okay guys, question for you. Sub-question to the question. If you could wear one article of clothing and it would be considered socially acceptable that you can't wear right now, what would it be?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
A vest.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
A vest? That's okay, right? Doesn't that Glee teacher wear a vest?

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
Vests are okay. Vests really are coming back.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
I would say brightly colored cis offenders.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
Oh yeah? Like Gallagher?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Like what?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Like Gallagher?

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Like Gallagher or like Morgue.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
Morgue, yeah.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Mine's cock rings.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
Oh God. That's your gut too.

23:10.000 --> 23:16.000
Can I ask, if you are putting yourself in a situation where people are commenting on your cock rings, you're doing it wrong.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Yeah, yeah.

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
I guess what I'm saying is I wish I could walk around with my wiener out. By extension.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
Yeah, by extension indeed.

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
In the baseball analogy, what is getting to third base?

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
I think it's pretty clear that second base is getting touch boobies.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
And home is intercourse.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
What would you call third base?

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
I think it's got to be something that has at least the possibility of an orgasm.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
What do you think, Seth from Gmail?

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
Well, in my experience, it's when second base is touch boobies.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
Third base is think about the terrible things you've done with your life.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Sure, third base is guilt.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
Yeah, and then fourth base is sitting at home by yourself crying.

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
Third base is getting to second base without having to pay for dinner.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
No, for real though. First base is kissing.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Second base is hand stuff.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Third base is mouth stuff.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
And then a home run is, as you so delicately put it, intercourse.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
Like a robot. And a grand slam is her and her sister and a teacher.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
Right. A ground roll double probably has something to do with premature ejaculation.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I'll set that out later.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
An error is true love waits.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
And never bunt.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
Never bunt. Absolutely. Absolute malt.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
I feel like there's more baseball analogies.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
If only I knew more sports.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
Buying a cotton candy in the stands.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
What is that?

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
Paying too much for a program.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
Well, that's a metaphor for Mars, Venus, I guess.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Going to the bullpen.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
What would be an in the parker?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
What?

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Like when you hit a ball.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
That's why it happens while she's still asleep.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Yeah.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
That's accurate.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Or when you have sex with a girl named Parker.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
Good luck with that.

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
Hey, let's make this an appropriate segue, which we never do.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Jphonic.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Known creator of the dopest beats.

25:32.000 --> 25:38.000
And it is from Yahoo Answers user River Cole who asks,

25:38.000 --> 25:44.000
What does BJ or HJ mean?

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
What does HJ mean in sex terms?

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
Well, my friend used it in abbreviations and IDK what it means.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
I think that the answer to this one is pretty clear cut,

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
but I just wanted to share it because the first answer,

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
the top answer is the best thing I've ever read.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
It's from Answerer 1 who says,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Um, fun?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Source.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
And the source for their information that HJs and BJs mean fun,

26:12.000 --> 26:20.000
their source is 14 and loving it.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Okay, so that means one of a few things.

26:23.000 --> 26:29.000
One, this person has had 14 blowjobs or hits and is a fan.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Mix and match, I would say.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
They are still in fact loving it.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
Nine HJs, five BJs.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Yeah.

26:35.000 --> 26:41.000
Two in the Parkers.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
They have bought cotton candy in this dance.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
If you know what I mean.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
If you know what I mean.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
Man, the rest of the answers on this are weird.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
I bet.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Yeah?

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
I don't know that I should be answering that.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
You mean what I'm going to do to you?

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Email me.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
I'm teenboy13.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
HJ stands for Howard Johnsons.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Yeah.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Howard Johnsons.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
It's when you guys fuck and then go to a Hojo's.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
What's up?

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
What's up?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Get the scramble.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
What?

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
Pinch hitters.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
I'm terrified of what that would be.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Sit down, girl.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
I'm going to give you...

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Sit down, girl.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
I'm going to give you a Dusty Baker.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
This is Jimmy.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
He's my designated runner.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I don't think you have this anywhere, do they?

27:32.000 --> 27:38.000
You just got to make sure you wear protection or else you'll get Lou Gehrig's disease.

27:38.000 --> 27:48.000
I'll do this.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
Oh, God.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
I'm so sorry.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
If Mrs. Gehrig is listening, it's our bad.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Mrs. Gehrig, I'm so sorry.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Oh, God.

28:04.000 --> 28:10.000
Wouldn't that be a trip if your doctor was like, you have Lou Gehrig's disease?

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
What?

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
No, that's a metaphor.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
You have chlamydia.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
Well, I guess it's better.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Oh, shit.

28:17.000 --> 28:28.000
Now I'm going to have to tell my parents about my prostitution.

28:28.000 --> 28:34.000
My longtime friend of 20 years has turned into a bitter jerk in the past year.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
How can I get him back to his old self again?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
A frying pan to the head.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
Yeah, drop something heavy on him.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
Jeff, it sounds like you may not have your...

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
We got another question right after this.

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
It says, I've been really depressed for a year and my friend Jeff only thinks about how it affects him.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
How can I find new friends?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Come on, snap out of it.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
My grandma just died, Jeff.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Come on.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Come on, I'm trying to party.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Let's go get Loke tonight.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Jeff, I told you.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
I have Lou Gehrig's disease.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Yeah, but you go to doctor...

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
No, like, for reals.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Literal.

29:15.000 --> 29:25.000
God, someone is going to think, God, these guys used to be funny, but then when they started laughing about Lou Gehrig's disease...

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
We're not laughing about Lou Gehrig's disease.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
It's not funny at all.

29:31.000 --> 29:41.000
But when you use it as a, like, referencing, like an STD for baseball metaphors, that sentence was so fucked up.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Yeah.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
It was a real fucked up sentence I just pieced together there.

29:44.000 --> 29:50.000
Jeff, have you considered purchasing your friend a My Brother, My Brother, Me T-shirt available now at bmbam.com?

29:50.000 --> 29:55.000
Nothing makes me feel confident and lovely like a My Brother, My Brother, Me T-shirt.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Jeff, talk to him, buddy.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Just say, like, hey, friend.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Let's call friend Gregor.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Hey, Gregor.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
What has been bothering you for the past year?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Because I feel like you're kind of down.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Because, you know what?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
The problem is you're not an advice professional.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
We are.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
So find out what his problem is and have him write in.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Or you write in.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
And then we can help him from there.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
But until you talk to him and figure out, like, like, bitter jerk, okay?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
That's how it manifests on the outside.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
But what, like, what's inside that bitter jerk?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
What's inside that bitter jerk?

30:25.000 --> 30:30.000
Because somewhere deep down is that heart of that guy you've been a friend of for 20 years.

30:30.000 --> 30:39.000
You just got to help him brush away all that bitterness and get back to that guy who used to drive you home after you've been drinking too much.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Shortcut, take him to Vegas.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Vegas fixes everything.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Also, he's secretly in love with you.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Boom, boom, pow.

30:48.000 --> 31:00.000
Like, you have a situation on your hands that, you know, you got to talk to him about it before it develops from a schoolboy crush into a full blown, like, swim fan love affair.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Yeah.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
Now, maybe it's reciprocated, in which case, God bless you, mom.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Good work.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
Don't ask, do tell.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
What?

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
NBNB AM, there's this girl that I like.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Original, right?

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
She's my best friend's girlfriend's best – wait, no.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Okay, hold on.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Let's try this again.

31:19.000 --> 31:27.000
She's my best friend's, okay, girlfriend's best friend.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Okay.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Okay, got it.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
What should I do?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
It could get kind of messy.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
The best things always are, FormSpring.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
The best things always are.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
How else – like, okay, God bless you.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
How else are you supposed to meet people?

31:41.000 --> 31:47.000
You can't eliminate people because they are of a tertiary friendship.

31:47.000 --> 31:52.000
No, like, my cousin used to go to science class with her brother-in-law, so I don't

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
think it's going to work out.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
It's going to be messy.

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
Her mom is my aunt and – no, wait.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Do rule that out.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
That's a good one.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Yeah.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
This is – that's too many degrees of separation for you to be worried about it because if

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
you guys date and then break up, it's not like your best friend's girlfriend is going

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
to, you know –

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Unless you're in high school.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
Unless you're in high school and you guys all go to class together.

32:15.000 --> 32:20.000
If it works out well, it could be really good because it's like double dating and stuff.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
The problem with double dating couples that people don't tell you about is you can't

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
ever break up.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
No one can ever, ever break up because then it is a problem.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Why is it going to get messy?

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
Why are you thinking about the end of this relationship before you're thinking about

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
the beginning?

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
That ain't no way to love.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
It could be beautiful.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
It could be beautiful.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
She could be the one.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.700
What if she's the one and you let her go because it could get messy?

32:44.700 --> 32:47.200
You know what's messy, FormSpring?

32:47.200 --> 32:48.200
Love is messy.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.200
Mm-hmm.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.700
Love – there ain't no rules to love.

32:51.700 --> 32:55.000
Untreated Lou Gehrig's disease is messy, for example.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Yeah.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.320
Lot, lot of drainage.

32:58.320 --> 32:59.320
Just really –

32:59.320 --> 33:00.320
Oh, God.

33:00.320 --> 33:01.320
Hey.

33:01.320 --> 33:03.000
See a doctor and get rid of it.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.520
Let's do another Yahoo because I got like nine more.

33:05.520 --> 33:06.520
Hit me.

33:06.520 --> 33:07.520
Okay.

33:07.520 --> 33:10.320
Let me pick the best one.

33:10.320 --> 33:13.800
Let's do two back-to-back because they're somewhat related.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.400
This one was sent in by Dilbob.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.880
Good name.

33:16.880 --> 33:23.480
No, Dilbob is – Dilbob submitted an answer last week, so don't make fun of him because

33:23.480 --> 33:27.480
he's a big, big fan of the show and he's a big supporter of the show.

33:27.480 --> 33:28.480
And he's bad at picking names.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.000
He's bad at picking names.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.800
God love him.

33:32.800 --> 33:37.920
It's from Yahoo Answers user iamattrolley who says –

33:37.920 --> 33:41.040
I'm going to call bullshit right now.

33:41.040 --> 33:47.520
His profile image is the shopping cart, which I guess – do people call those trolleys

33:47.520 --> 33:48.520
and where is this?

33:48.520 --> 33:49.520
Probably British.

33:49.520 --> 33:50.520
Oh, this is from Yahoo Canada.

33:50.520 --> 33:51.520
Whoa.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.520
Whoa.

33:52.520 --> 34:00.000
They ask, how far could Jesus give me a piggyback before tiring?

34:00.000 --> 34:06.800
Now keep in mind, he weighs 75 to 80 kilos and he hasn't weighed himself in a while.

34:06.800 --> 34:07.800
Okay.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.320
Do we have any idea what that conversion is?

34:10.320 --> 34:13.320
Because that could be like 700 pounds.

34:13.320 --> 34:17.360
What we don't have is information about Jesus' upper body strength.

34:17.360 --> 34:19.000
Yeah.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.860
We know his calves are banging.

34:20.860 --> 34:24.720
I know he's got to be totally ripped.

34:24.720 --> 34:29.760
I imagine that working as a carpenter really blasts your core and it gets your delts and

34:29.760 --> 34:34.480
your body is just banging, just banging and bustling out of your arm skin.

34:34.480 --> 34:35.480
Yeah.

34:35.480 --> 34:42.360
He used to turn water into protein powder all the time.

34:42.360 --> 34:46.200
I get why this guy's concerned though because there where there's one pair of footsteps,

34:46.200 --> 34:47.520
that is where he's going to carry you.

34:47.520 --> 34:51.520
So you want to know exactly how long of a trip you've got.

34:51.520 --> 34:52.520
Right.

34:52.520 --> 34:56.200
That's where you were getting an old piggyback ride and some cotton candy.

34:56.200 --> 35:00.200
You know, the problem is Jesus will never tell you if he's tired of carrying you.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.840
That's the thing because you could ask him all day because he's not going to admit to

35:02.840 --> 35:03.840
it.

35:03.840 --> 35:04.840
He'll just kind of pass out.

35:04.840 --> 35:07.120
He'll just turn the other cheek.

35:07.120 --> 35:09.040
This question was sent in by Jay.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.040
Thank you, Jay.

35:10.040 --> 35:20.680
It's by Yahoo Answers user askamexican who asks, why does Jesus only visits when my camera

35:20.680 --> 35:23.600
is out of batteries?

35:23.600 --> 35:34.200
See, this sounds like a guy who has a lot of stories that a lot of people aren't buying.

35:34.200 --> 35:41.280
One answerer, toke lover, he replied, he must be allergic to batteries.

35:41.280 --> 35:44.280
That's a pretty good theory, I guess.

35:44.280 --> 35:48.040
That's why he hasn't been around for a while.

35:48.040 --> 35:53.960
I just love that it's not just that Jesus visited once, Jesus just keeps coming back.

35:53.960 --> 35:56.320
Why don't you have batteries on hand?

35:56.320 --> 36:03.200
Oh, Jay-Sue, it's so great to get the Nikon, get the Nikon.

36:03.200 --> 36:06.480
I actually like to think that Jesus knows when it's out of batteries and he shows up

36:06.480 --> 36:09.600
at that moment and goes, hey everybody, and then poofs out.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.880
You think Jesus, you know, only stops by at random intervals?

36:12.880 --> 36:16.280
No, he waits until you're out of batteries and then he comes to visit you.

36:16.280 --> 36:19.760
I actually have used that for a system to know when I need to go buy batteries.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.760
Jesus, what the hell?

36:21.760 --> 36:23.760
Oh, hey Jesus, that time again?

36:23.760 --> 36:24.760
Alright.

36:24.760 --> 36:28.680
I gotta get those rechargeables.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.680
Your dad, damn it.

36:30.680 --> 36:34.480
I should have been ready.

36:34.480 --> 36:35.480
You got me again, Jay-Sue.

36:35.480 --> 36:39.520
Got me again, Jay-Sue.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.520
Let's see, where are we at?

36:40.520 --> 36:41.520
What do you think?

36:41.520 --> 36:42.520
One more?

36:42.520 --> 36:43.520
Yeah.

36:43.520 --> 36:47.080
Yeah, one more, we'll do a short one here.

36:47.080 --> 36:50.520
Do you guys have any suggestions for a diet that will keep me working at the most efficient

36:50.520 --> 36:51.520
rate?

36:51.520 --> 36:52.520
Evan, Gmail.

36:52.520 --> 37:00.040
It sounds like you need robot components to keep you working at maximum efficiency.

37:00.040 --> 37:02.040
Yeah, you need batteries.

37:02.040 --> 37:04.920
That's why you'll never see Jesus.

37:04.920 --> 37:06.840
All Subway sandwiches all the time.

37:06.840 --> 37:07.840
Yeah.

37:07.840 --> 37:08.840
They seem to work really well.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.880
I actually get what he's saying.

37:10.880 --> 37:18.800
I think that there is a way of eating and taking care of yourself that makes you active.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.440
I haven't followed that regimen in a while.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.440
Right.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.920
Eat exactly the opposite of what your body is telling you to eat.

37:24.920 --> 37:29.360
That seems to be the path to proper nutrition.

37:29.360 --> 37:34.880
Be careful of like, if you get on a, and this, God, we're like the worst people to be asking

37:34.880 --> 37:40.760
this question, but if you have too many carbs and sugars, then your body's just going to

37:40.760 --> 37:43.760
keep wanting those, crashing.

37:43.760 --> 37:44.760
Yeah.

37:44.760 --> 37:45.760
Don't eat candy all day.

37:45.760 --> 37:46.760
Don't eat candy all day.

37:46.760 --> 37:51.480
God knows I've had a two pound bag of Swedish fish and just like, this is what my day's

37:51.480 --> 37:52.480
about now.

37:52.480 --> 37:53.480
Yeah.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.480
But you're going to hate it.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.080
You're going to hate how you feel.

37:57.080 --> 38:01.520
What you got to do, and what I've been trying to do, trying to train my body up to do lately

38:01.520 --> 38:08.600
is to combine all of my meals into one super big meal that I eat at around 2 PM.

38:08.600 --> 38:09.600
Super meal.

38:09.600 --> 38:10.600
Right.

38:10.600 --> 38:16.800
And I call it Brunner, which is a portmanteau.

38:16.800 --> 38:21.240
And it gets, I get all of my food groups in there and it takes about an hour to fully

38:21.240 --> 38:22.240
eat.

38:22.240 --> 38:23.240
Yeah.

38:23.240 --> 38:24.960
And then you sleep for six hours.

38:24.960 --> 38:30.760
And then I sleep for six hours, wake up at around 9 PM and just live the day out.

38:30.760 --> 38:36.520
The weird thing about Brunner is, or super meal colloquially, is that if you, Griffin

38:36.520 --> 38:40.080
needs complete concentration to avoid retching in the middle of it.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.080
That's right.

38:41.080 --> 38:46.280
If you call Griffin between two and three o'clock, you will just hear protracted vomiting

38:46.280 --> 38:47.280
noises.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.280
Uh huh.

38:48.280 --> 38:49.280
It's, he will.

38:49.280 --> 38:50.280
But that's it.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.280
That's another handy, that's another handy skill to have.

38:51.280 --> 38:56.720
That's just one of the many benefits that Brunner gives to its, to its users.

38:56.720 --> 38:59.440
Protracted vomiting or concentration?

38:59.440 --> 39:05.960
The ability to not vomit when your body, just everything inside your body wants you to.

39:05.960 --> 39:11.480
Every organ is working in harmony to try and get you to, to expunge.

39:11.480 --> 39:15.600
I think the best suggestion is, think about, is this something the McElroy brothers would

39:15.600 --> 39:16.600
eat?

39:16.600 --> 39:18.120
And if the answer is yes, do not eat it.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.120
Don't eat it.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.120
Eat the opposite thing.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.120
Well, let's be more specific.

39:21.120 --> 39:25.160
If it's something that Travis would, does, and regularly eats.

39:25.160 --> 39:26.360
Or has in the past.

39:26.360 --> 39:30.960
Or has or is currently eating while you're asking the question.

39:30.960 --> 39:35.720
Every so often, my lunch consists of eating an entire Papa John's large thin crust

39:35.720 --> 39:36.720
pizza in one sitting.

39:36.720 --> 39:37.720
Yes.

39:37.720 --> 39:38.720
Every so often.

39:38.720 --> 39:42.000
See, I was joking about, I was joking about Super Meal.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
But you really, you really go the whole nine yards on that.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Your problem is that.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
I live that dream.

39:47.000 --> 39:53.320
You do Super Meal and then you also do Mini Meals at around 10 AM and 10 PM.

39:53.320 --> 39:54.320
Second Brunner.

39:54.320 --> 39:55.320
Pre-Brunner.

39:55.320 --> 39:56.320
And then a spot of tea.

39:56.320 --> 39:59.920
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

39:59.920 --> 40:05.640
But first a couple of housekeeping things as always, nbnbam.com is the address.

40:05.640 --> 40:06.640
For our website.

40:06.640 --> 40:07.900
You can ask us questions there.

40:07.900 --> 40:08.960
Please ask us questions.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.280
I know you've got them.

40:10.280 --> 40:13.460
Nobody gets through life without them.

40:13.460 --> 40:15.880
We are going to have new t-shirts.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.800
Just got a finalized design for a new design.

40:18.800 --> 40:19.800
Brand new design coming.

40:19.800 --> 40:20.800
It's fresh.

40:20.800 --> 40:21.800
It's fresh.

40:21.800 --> 40:25.760
It'll probably be pre-orders in a week or so.

40:25.760 --> 40:27.360
But of course we'll give you the heads up on that.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.880
You can still get our app.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.400
My brother and my brother and me, the App Experience.

40:31.400 --> 40:33.800
It's on iTunes and there's a link at nbnbam.com.

40:33.800 --> 40:39.280
Oh, I didn't mention it on the show, but there was a little bonus on last week's episode.

40:39.280 --> 40:44.440
It was the full version of the acoustic number that we had at the end of the show, which

40:44.440 --> 40:49.640
was, I can't remember the guy's name who wrote it, John Paloma.

40:49.640 --> 40:50.880
I'm so sorry.

40:50.880 --> 40:55.120
I'm sure he's listening and I just butchered his name, but thank you.

40:55.120 --> 40:58.720
I'll get his full name and put it in the show notes.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.760
A lot of people like that.

41:00.760 --> 41:01.760
Paloma.

41:01.760 --> 41:02.760
Paloma?

41:02.760 --> 41:05.280
P-A-L-O-M-B-A.

41:05.280 --> 41:07.280
Thank you, you guy.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.960
You guy, fella.

41:09.960 --> 41:13.600
Thank you to people out there spreading the word.

41:13.600 --> 41:19.260
I love to see people who just start listening to the show and then they go into like a show

41:19.260 --> 41:23.440
coma and listen to all of them like back to back to back.

41:23.440 --> 41:33.680
Corey was here, 1212, let's with a K, said, I just caught up on, no, no, no, no.

41:33.680 --> 41:34.680
Which one was Corey?

41:34.680 --> 41:36.040
Oh, here it is.

41:36.040 --> 41:40.800
Just listen to all 25 episodes and this show is amazing.

41:40.800 --> 41:48.640
That's Corey was here, 1212, just a new listener on board and is preaching the converted.

41:48.640 --> 41:58.040
Also we would be remiss to not mention Eric Smith, who is, if all goes according to plan,

41:58.040 --> 42:00.840
currently getting a my brother, my brother, me tattoo.

42:00.840 --> 42:01.840
God damn it.

42:01.840 --> 42:02.840
Don't do it.

42:02.840 --> 42:03.840
Yeah, do it.

42:03.840 --> 42:04.840
Do it.

42:04.840 --> 42:05.840
Do it to yourself.

42:05.840 --> 42:06.840
Don't listen to Griffin.

42:06.840 --> 42:07.840
Don't listen to Griffin.

42:07.840 --> 42:10.960
If he does it, we're never recording the show again, everybody.

42:10.960 --> 42:16.360
Just to let you know, this has all been a hilarious months long prank.

42:16.360 --> 42:19.880
We'll actually remove all the episodes from the internet and we'll make it as though it

42:19.880 --> 42:22.760
had never existed.

42:22.760 --> 42:26.000
We didn't get too many, didn't get too many voicemails this week.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.480
Call and leave us a voicemail at two zero three, my bim bam one and just like, just

42:31.480 --> 42:33.800
like talk to us, I guess.

42:33.800 --> 42:38.320
I guess just like, I guess just like talk to us and like tell us about your day and

42:38.320 --> 42:44.880
like just tell us like, I don't know, something about yourself, anything.

42:44.880 --> 42:45.880
Just like open up.

42:45.880 --> 42:46.880
Are you calling?

42:46.880 --> 42:47.880
Are you calling right now?

42:47.880 --> 42:48.880
Are you calling us right now?

42:48.880 --> 42:49.880
We can wait for you.

42:49.880 --> 42:50.880
We're waiting for you.

42:50.880 --> 42:51.880
We'll wait.

42:51.880 --> 42:52.880
It's not a big deal.

42:52.880 --> 42:55.800
Thank you guys so much for listening as always.

42:55.800 --> 43:02.280
And we have a final question, sort of one to grow on, one to think about over this,

43:02.280 --> 43:06.680
this week while we are apart, you and us.

43:06.680 --> 43:09.920
And of course we will catch you back next Monday.

43:09.920 --> 43:15.660
Oh, if you want to have a listening party, we've got a few people talking about it.

43:15.660 --> 43:21.200
Make sure you email us with listening party and the subject line it's bmbam at gmail.com

43:21.200 --> 43:27.040
and let us know who's going to be there and we will prerecord something personal for your

43:27.040 --> 43:28.040
party.

43:28.040 --> 43:31.760
Um, so, so let us know and get in contact that way.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.320
And we are happy to do it.

43:33.320 --> 43:37.420
Um, thanks for spreading the word to everybody and turning your friends on everything.

43:37.420 --> 43:38.420
Spread it around.

43:38.420 --> 43:41.800
Spread it like Lou Gehrig's disease, Griffin.

43:41.800 --> 43:48.320
This one is sent in by Cal, um, who sent in a few real, just bang up questions before.

43:48.320 --> 43:49.600
Thank you so much, Cal.

43:49.600 --> 43:55.720
Uh, it's by Yahoo Answers user Kane Forever, um, that's all caps, which is why I said it

43:55.720 --> 43:56.720
like that.

43:56.720 --> 43:57.720
Okay.

43:57.720 --> 44:04.720
Kane Forever asks, what is the earliest age that you should use anabolic steroids?

44:04.720 --> 44:15.720
I'm Justin McElroy, I'm Travis McElroy, I'm Griffin McElroy, this has been my brother,

44:15.720 --> 44:20.680
my brother and me, kiss your dad, square on the lips.

44:20.680 --> 44:21.680
You will never know me.

44:21.680 --> 44:38.680
I'm Justin McElroy, I'm Travis McElroy, this has been my brother, my brother and me, kiss

44:38.680 --> 44:53.480
your dad, square on the lips.
