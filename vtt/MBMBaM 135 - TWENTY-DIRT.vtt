WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.160
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome my brother, my brother, me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:50.160 --> 00:57.360
I'm your super smooth, totally great host with the best pipes in the biz, Justin McElroy,

00:57.360 --> 01:03.280
oldest brother. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby, Griffin. Justin,

01:04.160 --> 01:10.240
I can hear your individual vocal cords slapping against each other like two wet hams,

01:10.240 --> 01:18.960
just slapping away. Yeah, over the Christmas break, I took a lot of classes in how to get

01:18.960 --> 01:26.800
that deep, rich sound that all the radio babes crave. Was that taught by the Wolfman on WAMX?

01:26.800 --> 01:37.520
It's taught by Dr. Wolfs. He's the wolfiest guy that is around. Why do you sound the way that you

01:37.520 --> 01:43.280
do? Well, I've got a great, I got a new microphone for Christmas. It's a grownup microphone that's

01:43.280 --> 01:49.280
plugged into like a mixing board that gives me full control over the sound. So if I want to go

01:49.280 --> 01:54.400
like full high on the EQ, let me check the EQ. It sounds like you're coming from the future.

01:54.400 --> 02:00.800
Sure. I am, Travis, and in the future, I have full control over the EQ. Do you make it sound

02:00.800 --> 02:05.520
like you're in a box? What? Make it sound like you're in a box. Make it sound like I'm in a box.

02:05.520 --> 02:09.680
Okay, the one thing I'm going to tell you is I forgot to monitor myself, so I don't know what

02:09.680 --> 02:14.320
any of this sounds like. Well, now I have more like an old-timey radio. Now I'm over here.

02:15.520 --> 02:20.080
Well, you just cut it out entirely. Now you've disappeared. Now I'm over here in your left ear.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.160
Okay, so don't go back to the right ear because there's nothing good for us.

02:24.160 --> 02:28.480
I'm going to get like a nice healthy blend here of all three of my different voices.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.200
Can you put on like an old-timey prospector filter?

02:32.480 --> 02:37.200
Yeah, hold on one second. All right, Griff, when you're editing this,

02:37.200 --> 02:40.400
just make it sound like I'm an old-timey prospector. Yeah, I should be able to do

02:40.400 --> 02:46.560
that in the free basic version of Audacity that I have. Probably has that capability.

02:46.560 --> 02:50.080
This is only the middle. What's in the middle? What does this sound like?

02:50.080 --> 02:56.880
Nothing good. You sound like a Tally Hall record. Yeah. This is great. So you have a stude now.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.760
Can you welcome people into your office and say, welcome to the stude?

02:59.760 --> 03:03.360
Welcome to the stude. Here's my four-channel mixing board.

03:03.360 --> 03:06.640
You are not going to sound great, I bet, for the rest of the podcast because of this groove.

03:07.280 --> 03:14.400
No, I think it'll sound really good because I've got a good balance right now. I am going to take

03:14.400 --> 03:21.040
that bass up a little bit because it is like testosterone on a dial. Yeah, you're basically

03:21.040 --> 03:27.280
pushing the end of your penis outwards. You're pushing it. You're stretching my prongs.

03:27.280 --> 03:32.160
Stretching the flesh, as it were. That's his industry terms.

03:33.280 --> 03:37.120
Did you guys introduce yourselves and shit? Yeah, you were so busy with your knobs and

03:37.120 --> 03:41.840
your doodads. God, I was really busy with them. Is it going to be bad that we don't have doodads

03:41.840 --> 03:48.080
and what's its galore? Yeah. Comparatively, you will sound like bug kings. You'll sound like

03:49.680 --> 03:59.440
the omnipotent rulers of some sort of bug kingdom. Okay. I am drinking cucumber lime Gatorade.

04:00.080 --> 04:05.360
Whoa. I bought it because it was green and green beverages are usually a surefire hit.

04:05.360 --> 04:10.000
Just asked Dr. Mountain Dew. Have you guys had Dr. Mountain Dew?

04:10.000 --> 04:16.480
Mm-hmm. That's the big K version of Mountain Dew. I can't believe it's not copyright infringement.

04:16.480 --> 04:21.760
Oh, God. This tastes like fresh squeezed juice, but without all of the shit inside of it that's

04:21.760 --> 04:26.160
supposed to be good for you. It tastes like the ghost of fresh squeezed juice. Yeah. It's like if

04:26.160 --> 04:30.800
you put juice in a centrifuge, but I'm talking like that juice that you make in a juicer with

04:30.800 --> 04:37.040
kale and stuff. By the way, thanks for the juicer, Justin. You can tell I'm getting deep into it.

04:37.040 --> 04:41.120
You're really getting deep into it because you went to the store and bought cucumber Gatorade.

04:41.120 --> 04:46.400
Can't make it my own. What do you juice to get electrolytes? A light bulb? Electricity?

04:46.400 --> 04:50.800
Bigger electrolytes. Okay. But then you have to deal with the rind.

04:52.640 --> 04:57.520
I think you just put batteries in there. Yeah. That'll work. Let's do some... Let's do advice.

04:57.520 --> 05:02.640
Let's do advice. I'm on a new health kick. Oh, so let's talk about that instead. Sorry.

05:02.640 --> 05:07.680
Is that good? It's just, I've been mixing oatmeal into pretty much everything.

05:07.680 --> 05:14.800
Well, that'll do it. You get full real fast. You get full so fast. That sounds like something you

05:14.800 --> 05:22.000
would do in the depression. Yeah. You thin out your turnips with some oatmeal. It's World War

05:22.000 --> 05:31.760
II rationing all over again. Those are all olives. If you slop some oatmeal onto some ribs and do a

05:31.760 --> 05:38.080
dry rub, it makes the ribs healthier for your tummy and heart. I mixed them into some yogurt

05:38.080 --> 05:44.320
with some Craisins today and it was very filling and not a food. Now, Justin, I want you to be

05:44.320 --> 05:50.640
honest. When you say you got into a health kick of mixing oatmeal into stuff, do you mean you put

05:50.640 --> 05:58.640
some in your yogurt this morning and that was it? No, I don't think so. Okay. Yes. Correct. That is

05:58.640 --> 06:04.800
correct. I've been on this health. I've tried everything. I've tried everything until I lose

06:04.800 --> 06:10.240
weight. Have you tried eating healthy food and working out? That's my new thing. That's my new

06:10.240 --> 06:14.320
jam that I'm going to- Because I feel like when you say you tried everything, you mean just eating

06:14.320 --> 06:20.880
bacon. His last ditch effort. All hope was lost with nothing left to lose. Why didn't you stick

06:20.880 --> 06:30.000
with ketosis? You looked so jaundiced when you were on that ketosis. You had such a healthy yellow glow.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.160
Especially around your neck when it was a darker orange. Oh, God, you looked amazing.

06:36.560 --> 06:44.240
I thought about it, Griffin. I realized that even though I felt terrible and was dying, I thought,

06:44.240 --> 06:49.440
someday I want to be able to look at my kid in the eye and when they look back at me,

06:49.440 --> 06:55.760
I don't want them to see two weird lemons staring back at them. I'm just going to go ahead and try

06:55.760 --> 07:00.400
to eat a vegetable or two. You don't have resilience. I think it was Kate Moss who said,

07:00.400 --> 07:06.240
nothing tastes as good as jaundiced looks. Right. I think that was correct. All right. Let's actually

07:06.240 --> 07:10.480
help some people. Travis, I don't like the font you used in the email this week. I just wanted to-

07:10.480 --> 07:15.440
Well, blame it on my new iPad mini, Justin. Did you arrange it on your iPad mini? I did.

07:15.440 --> 07:21.040
This does not have the sexy sex appeal that you expect from an eye product. My boyfriend

07:21.040 --> 07:24.640
and I have been dating for almost three years. We both see ourselves in it for the long haul.

07:25.200 --> 07:29.280
But when we talk about the future, I want to live in a beautiful apartment in the city

07:29.280 --> 07:33.840
and he wants to live off the grid in a cabin in the woods. While I support being self-sustaining,

07:33.840 --> 07:39.600
I still want all the cushy amenities of life. Is there a compromise here? What would you do?

07:39.600 --> 07:45.520
What would you do? Vexed in Vancouver. So you want the stores. He wants the chores.

07:45.520 --> 07:51.600
And the bores, the wild bores. He wants fresh air. You want Times Square.

07:51.600 --> 07:56.080
He wants Arnold the pig and you want to eat Arnold the pig. I didn't watch. I never saw

07:56.080 --> 08:00.960
that show. Did not see Green Acres myself. No, never. You got a Green Acres scenario going on

08:00.960 --> 08:07.120
here. I feel like the solution is easy. You just live off the grid in a cabin in the city.

08:07.120 --> 08:13.760
I'm trying to find your apartment and I got it. I'm lost. I'm adjacent to where you said it would

08:13.760 --> 08:18.560
be, but I don't see anything here. I feel like my mind has been clouded

08:19.120 --> 08:22.240
and I cannot see it. If only I could see through the haze.

08:23.200 --> 08:28.800
You're saying you want some sort of hologram magic invisistial that you want to wrap around.

08:28.800 --> 08:33.200
Well, mine was more of a reference to the hit movie, The Shadows, starring Alec Baldwin.

08:33.200 --> 08:41.440
No, just me? No, just you. Got it. Okay. Eddie Albert was, of course,

08:41.440 --> 08:45.120
the star of Green Acres and I don't have a point.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.600
Fuck. I think anytime someone says the phrase,

08:51.600 --> 08:56.800
I want to live off the grid, it's a little bit weird to me to begin with.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.400
Everybody wants to vacation off the grid. Well, yeah, but you don't want to live off

09:00.400 --> 09:05.840
the grid. Well, I guess if you don't want to impact this relationship that you treasure so much,

09:07.040 --> 09:10.000
which by the way, three years and no ring on it, sweetie.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.400
Lock it down. Lock it in and up.

09:15.120 --> 09:20.640
Wear a locket. Wear a locket. I think you got to give in and I think you acquiesce and I think you

09:20.640 --> 09:24.560
live off the grid for like two weeks and he's like, this fucking sucks. Can we please-

09:24.560 --> 09:26.880
Keep your apartment, okay? Let's just put it that way.

09:26.880 --> 09:30.880
I just pooped outside for the 28th time. You want to go?

09:30.880 --> 09:33.920
Why don't you just like have an off the grid vacation home?

09:34.480 --> 09:38.400
Yeah. See, that seems like rational to me. Get it like a split,

09:39.040 --> 09:42.400
a time splitter with a bunch of other young professionals.

09:43.760 --> 09:49.600
Or get split level, live half the home on the grid and the other half is off the grid.

09:49.600 --> 09:53.520
Hey, should we go downstairs, have some coffee? I don't have a downstairs.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.800
I don't know what you're talking about. Please don't look at that door.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.400
Door, it's covered in ivy. There's no downstairs.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.880
I think when these people say- That's Fred Penner's place.

10:02.880 --> 10:06.320
You guys understand that when these people say off the grid, they're talking about like

10:06.320 --> 10:10.320
no power and internet, not that they live in a fucking invisible house, right?

10:10.320 --> 10:13.040
Because you guys know that that's not a goddamn thing that people can do,

10:13.040 --> 10:15.120
even when they're in the woods. Hey Griffin,

10:15.120 --> 10:20.240
spoiler alert, it sounds a good god deal more plausible than living without electricity and

10:20.240 --> 10:27.920
plumbing, okay? For me, I would much rather try to find a fantasy castle. You would have better odds

10:27.920 --> 10:38.480
of finding me in a mystical, some sort of illusory, time traveling magic castle than find me

10:39.360 --> 10:44.560
voluntarily without the creature comfort to which I've become accustomed.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.640
I feel like the next time your boyfriend brings it up, I think your response should be,

10:48.640 --> 10:54.560
oh so you want to break up because I guarantee living together for a solid month with nothing

10:54.560 --> 10:59.280
else to do but stare at each other until the sun goes down at six o'clock and then go to sleep,

10:59.280 --> 11:01.840
we'll kill each other. Yeah, I just saw Lincoln

11:03.840 --> 11:08.320
and that's basically what happened to the old Abe and Mary. So he's just like,

11:08.320 --> 11:12.000
even when he was the president, he's still living in a goddamn ramshackle shack.

11:12.560 --> 11:16.480
And all they can do is they can look at each other and like count how many of their sons are dead.

11:16.480 --> 11:21.840
So like they just lost their goddamned minds. Well, she more than him. She literally did.

11:22.480 --> 11:28.400
Well, he more literally lost his mind, but she, yeah, she done goofed mentally. And I think it

11:28.400 --> 11:33.920
really is just because you, it's just the stare down and you just, you lose it. You can't go,

11:33.920 --> 11:37.840
you gotta stay in the city. That's what internet, that's what iPad and iPhone is for. This is like

11:37.840 --> 11:41.360
another face that you can look at for a while. Just some other face.

11:41.360 --> 11:49.040
A palette cleanser from Mary Lincoln. And Mary Lincoln in the real was not a beautiful woman.

11:49.040 --> 11:54.720
Yeah, not like Sally Fields. Nice try, Stevo. Nice try, Stevo Spielberg. I see through your

11:54.720 --> 12:01.680
ruse. Here's a Mary Lincoln you'll want to fuck. Nice try. Nice try.

12:01.680 --> 12:12.480
Nice try. First he tries to, first he tries to make Val Kilmer into Moses. And now this.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.520
You guys see Prince of Egypt?

12:13.520 --> 12:15.440
We're all on the same level.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.280
Is this the same Skype call?

12:17.280 --> 12:17.760
I guess.

12:20.880 --> 12:28.320
You don't want to do this. I'm so rare. I'm all for finding balance in relationships, but I find

12:28.320 --> 12:35.280
uh, living off the grid so personally offensive that I don't think I can, I can endorse compromise

12:35.280 --> 12:35.680
here.

12:35.680 --> 12:39.520
I feel like it would be the kind of thing if my significant other brought up, I would just laugh

12:39.520 --> 12:42.400
and then be horrified when I realized they weren't joking.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.840
Yeah, it would be like the breakest of deal breakers.

12:45.840 --> 12:50.080
Could you just get a house with a big backyard and in that big backyard you can do projects

12:50.080 --> 12:53.280
and build himself a little hut. He can make, he can make it.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.600
Or like a house with a bomb shelter.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.760
Yeah, or a doomsday prepper shelter, which I guess is the same thing.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.520
Maybe like a farm property.

13:01.520 --> 13:01.920
Yep.

13:01.920 --> 13:05.360
So where you like, you could have a nice farm house with all the modern amenities

13:05.920 --> 13:09.760
and he could, although you know what, like even that's not, she wants that big city life.

13:09.760 --> 13:10.000
Yeah.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.000
I don't think it's going to work.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.200
I don't think it's going to work either. I'm sorry. This probably isn't the advice you were

13:15.200 --> 13:17.280
looking for, but it's over between the two of you.

13:17.280 --> 13:17.920
Sorry guys.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.880
We actually are just going to go ahead and officially proclaim you guys broken up.

13:22.880 --> 13:23.120
Yeah.

13:23.760 --> 13:24.880
He had a good run.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.480
I don't know. Maybe when you-

13:26.480 --> 13:28.960
He was apparently wishing the whole time that no one could find him.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.120
He's playing his own game of hide and seek with the world.

13:33.120 --> 13:36.640
He knows that once he's on the grid, like you're on it.

13:36.640 --> 13:40.160
I watch Homeland. Okay. You're on it. They can find you.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.280
Can I read a Yahoo?

13:43.280 --> 13:44.000
Please.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Ira Ray. Thanks Ira.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.840
It's by Yahoo answers user no name.

13:50.720 --> 13:51.040
Sorry.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.240
Sorry. Are you Ira Ray?

13:54.240 --> 13:54.560
Thank you.

13:54.560 --> 13:55.200
Who wants to know?

13:55.200 --> 13:56.000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

13:56.560 --> 14:00.960
No name asks, is it acceptable to wear a Snuggie in church?

14:02.560 --> 14:05.440
Have you ever seen anyone wearing a Snuggie in church?

14:05.440 --> 14:06.880
Do you wear one?

14:06.880 --> 14:11.200
If I went to church, I think it would be nice to snuggle up in the pew with your Snuggie in Bible.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.600
They should make them in religious theme prints for that purpose.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.120
I know somebody who wears a Snuggie in church.

14:17.120 --> 14:17.520
Who's that?

14:18.160 --> 14:19.920
Maybe, maybe he's called the Pope.

14:19.920 --> 14:25.520
Pope's been wearing a Snuggie for all of his papal days and no one's called him out on it yet.

14:26.320 --> 14:30.480
He's infallible and he's unsnugglable. He's so comfortable.

14:31.120 --> 14:36.080
I think, I think when you're wearing a Snuggie, you are literally the snuggliest you could ever be.

14:36.080 --> 14:40.880
But what if, what if they made a, I just had a great idea to like facilitate snuggling.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.680
What if you had a Snuggie, but it ran around, it went around your entire body and you could even

14:45.680 --> 14:50.080
get fun with it and like make it like the shape of an animal.

14:50.080 --> 14:53.440
Wait, don't Snuggies already go around your entire body?

14:53.440 --> 14:58.720
No, no, your hands and your face and instead of a face, you would have like a wolf's, like a sexy wolf face.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.000
You're talking about a furry.

15:00.720 --> 15:05.360
No, I think what he's suggesting is like a full body animal costume.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.560
No, no, I'm talking about a full body Snuggie suit with animal, with animal skin.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.880
Okay, so you dress up as an animal and go to church.

15:10.880 --> 15:11.600
Basically.

15:11.600 --> 15:12.960
That's basically what I'm saying.

15:12.960 --> 15:13.760
That's basically it.

15:13.760 --> 15:14.240
Okay.

15:14.240 --> 15:23.200
We have, listen, we have come out in full support of basically every imaginable type of subgroup of people ever.

15:23.200 --> 15:23.680
Right.

15:23.680 --> 15:28.800
So I'm not knocking, I'm not knocking furries, I swear to you, but is there a furry church?

15:28.800 --> 15:35.520
But okay, because here's my point, I love steampunk, I don't want to see, you know,

15:35.520 --> 15:43.680
Dr. Laserbeam rolling up to church with his girlfriend and her parasol and Dr. Laserbeam

15:43.680 --> 15:45.680
talking about hazel, you know what I mean?

15:45.680 --> 15:47.200
Like time and place, people.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.400
I'm changing churches unless you make zeppelin parking.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.800
Where am I supposed to leave it?

15:54.800 --> 15:56.240
It's a giant balloon.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.680
This is my steam powered praying machine.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.240
You put your wish into this canister.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.280
I would shoot you, sir, if I wasn't out of water.

16:09.280 --> 16:16.320
Travis, where does your zealotry end if I can't steampunk in church?

16:16.320 --> 16:17.280
Can I wear shorts?

16:17.840 --> 16:19.520
Am I allowed to wear shorts to your church?

16:20.160 --> 16:24.880
You know, it's funny you asked that, but it gave me really strong shivers to picture it.

16:24.880 --> 16:25.120
Yeah.

16:25.840 --> 16:31.680
Not in my church, maybe some of those looser northern Baptist church.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.120
Yeah, I guess I didn't think about that.

16:33.120 --> 16:36.240
But in my church, full suits of armor.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.320
Is there a furry church?

16:38.320 --> 16:39.680
We didn't answer the question.

16:39.680 --> 16:42.800
I guess we have to answer the first answer the question if there's a furry heaven in hell.

16:43.760 --> 16:44.320
Well, yes.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.920
It's in a regular heaven in hell.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.040
I guess that's true.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.960
I want to go to furry church now.

16:50.960 --> 16:54.480
I want to go furry heaven, but let's let's get back to Snuggies

16:55.600 --> 16:57.600
because I feel like we've made Justin uncomfortable.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.640
I think Justin's left.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.520
I think Justin might have switched the nozzle.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.360
He might have flipped the flanger.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.480
Oh, I'm still here.

17:05.600 --> 17:06.160
What happened?

17:06.160 --> 17:09.120
My cat took a dump in here and I'm dying.

17:15.360 --> 17:19.680
I'm trying to like, listen to this goof and pick back up on the goof.

17:19.680 --> 17:22.160
And like, I'm trying to also light a sensei.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.280
Now, this is important.

17:25.840 --> 17:30.400
Is it the cat that you have that is approximately three apples long

17:30.400 --> 17:35.760
or is it the 600 pound sea cow with furry legs?

17:35.760 --> 17:38.880
Is it Fatty Catty or is it Nervous Nelly?

17:38.880 --> 17:41.040
I'm going to say it's the skinny one because they got it.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.720
It was like a stealth mesh.

17:42.720 --> 17:48.320
They got in and out and I didn't I didn't get them until I started getting in my old factories.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.200
Oh, God.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.560
It's so dirty in here.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.080
I have to find a candle.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.040
Say something funny.

18:00.080 --> 18:00.880
Oh, Christ.

18:00.880 --> 18:05.040
I mean, everybody, everybody who in their choir robes,

18:05.040 --> 18:09.520
which I'm assuming is at this church because if you if your choir is not wearing robes,

18:09.520 --> 18:10.800
what do you even do in there?

18:10.800 --> 18:13.440
Jesus can't hear the singing if they're not wearing robes.

18:15.040 --> 18:18.240
I sprayed some Old Spice Fiji body spray.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.760
Oh, it's getting a little better.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.600
Oh, no, it's getting worse.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.080
They're blending.

18:24.080 --> 18:24.400
Stop.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.680
They're blending.

18:25.680 --> 18:28.240
Stop doing aerosol alchemy.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.040
Can you not?

18:29.040 --> 18:35.600
Oh, it's like physical therapists and cat food and I hate it.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.920
Um, like Jim, bro.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.360
Let's do the next question.

18:39.360 --> 18:39.760
OK.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.280
Oh, I got a question.

18:41.280 --> 18:44.800
How do you get the cat poopy smell out of your office when you try to do comedy?

18:44.800 --> 18:46.080
This is a really good idea.

18:46.080 --> 18:49.200
The room in your house that you work out of and spend most of your time.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.880
Maybe don't let your animals shit.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.560
Maybe don't put up like shit receptacle for any living being in it.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.840
You have full control over where that shit occurs.

18:57.840 --> 19:01.520
It all started because I had to keep the little one locked in here

19:01.520 --> 19:03.120
to keep her separate from the big one.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.720
So I put the dookie box in here and then I thought,

19:06.720 --> 19:10.080
but then I realized I should move it out of here because I'm in here.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.840
Yeah, but then I'm so worried.

19:11.840 --> 19:15.680
He's like the cat like Amelia will be like, well, I always stay here before.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.040
Sorry.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.480
Didn't have that magic dirt.

19:20.880 --> 19:21.600
I'm a cat.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.480
Come on, Hemingway.

19:24.480 --> 19:25.680
You're my favorite sensei.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.560
Don't let me down now.

19:28.560 --> 19:34.160
Let the smooth blend of sandalwood and fucking cherries wash over me

19:34.160 --> 19:35.120
and save me from this.

19:35.680 --> 19:38.560
I don't think that's what Hemingway smelled like.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.720
I'm trying so hard, Justin.

19:41.600 --> 19:46.240
Hemingway probably smelled like probably pipe smoke and boner cream.

19:46.800 --> 19:47.680
Save me, Papa.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.160
I'm gonna light a pipe.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.120
That's a good idea.

19:51.120 --> 19:51.760
Hey, brothers.

19:52.400 --> 19:52.800
Should I?

19:54.240 --> 19:54.880
Hey, brothers.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.520
Should I eat mashed potatoes with a fork or a spoon?

19:58.320 --> 19:59.760
That's from mashed in Kentucky.

20:00.880 --> 20:01.760
With a fork.

20:01.760 --> 20:02.800
With a fork, right?

20:02.800 --> 20:04.000
I mean, that's the proper.

20:04.960 --> 20:10.800
I feel like if you eat them with a spoon, you're that's that's like the snuggie of eating.

20:10.800 --> 20:11.920
That's a good joy.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.120
It's like giving up.

20:13.120 --> 20:16.720
You're giving up like you're not eating it like a gentleman.

20:16.720 --> 20:17.200
Hey, I don't know.

20:17.200 --> 20:22.000
There's something about spoon that says like I need to get this in me as fast as possible.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.120
And I also don't have the coordination to stab something.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.080
Right, right.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.880
Just a real quick follow up question.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.960
Did you even watch Kony 2012?

20:31.600 --> 20:32.480
Mashed in Kentucky.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.640
Is this really the most fucking pressing?

20:36.640 --> 20:41.760
We are the goddamn wizards of Oz and you come to us with your one wish.

20:42.720 --> 20:43.360
You come to us.

20:43.360 --> 20:46.480
You've been blessed to have us answer your one riddle.

20:47.120 --> 20:47.920
And this is it.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.520
This is what you landed on.

20:49.520 --> 20:54.000
Don't you guys wish you could have been with Kony on New Year's Eve?

20:54.000 --> 20:58.880
Because, you know, he had to be like five, four, three, two.

20:58.880 --> 21:01.600
Yeah, not this year.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.560
Not this year.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.160
Trust fund babies.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.680
He can't come get Kony now.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.680
Who's going to pick up Kony 2013?

21:09.680 --> 21:10.560
No one.

21:10.560 --> 21:15.680
He had a whole year named after him to tribute like just to catching Kony.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.680
That's the one thing we had to do this year.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.000
He's out and he's done for good.

21:21.040 --> 21:26.080
Maybe that should be our annual motto that we still haven't come up with.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.320
Seriously though, Kony 2013.

21:31.760 --> 21:32.640
This time for sure.

21:36.400 --> 21:40.400
See, I gave Griffin one this weekend, but I don't think he liked it.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.520
How does Luke warm on it?

21:41.520 --> 21:42.080
What was it?

21:43.360 --> 21:44.240
2013.

21:45.920 --> 21:46.800
Get it out.

21:46.800 --> 21:47.840
Dig it up.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.800
Get it out.

21:48.800 --> 21:49.680
Get the dirt out.

21:49.680 --> 21:50.400
It's 13.

21:51.360 --> 21:54.320
13 would be the hashtag.

21:54.320 --> 21:55.120
Nobody's using it.

21:55.120 --> 21:58.560
We'd have like full control over 13.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.080
We were all about getting it, and now you've got it.

22:02.080 --> 22:02.880
What do you do with it?

22:02.880 --> 22:04.320
You got to get the dirt out.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.520
You know, someone else, I saw somebody post on Twitter, 20 did.

22:09.040 --> 22:13.680
Well, I like it to be a little bit more active, a little proactive, you know?

22:15.520 --> 22:16.240
I take it this way.

22:16.240 --> 22:17.920
So you can say what you did.

22:17.920 --> 22:22.480
Right, but if you chill on it for a second, if you stop for a second,

22:22.480 --> 22:26.480
and you turn your eyes away from the heavens and in front of you,

22:26.480 --> 22:29.520
your feet in front of you, and you look behind you, you're going to trip.

22:29.520 --> 22:30.320
Then you're going to die.

22:31.120 --> 22:34.480
Yeah, I don't want to take a moment to rest on our laurels.

22:34.480 --> 22:37.280
You might as well be eating mashed potatoes with a spoon.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.040
Yeah, that's not somebody who's active.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.040
That's not somebody who's there to get it.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.640
I eat mashed potatoes with a knife.

22:42.640 --> 22:47.680
Well, okay, the annualized motto question is so important,

22:47.680 --> 22:50.320
so let's knock this mashed potatoes bullshit out of the way real quick.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.560
You're going to eat it with a fork because it's there with something

22:52.560 --> 22:54.000
that you're also eating with a fork,

22:54.000 --> 22:58.560
and you're not going to put down that fork that you're eating turkey or ham or steak with

22:58.560 --> 23:03.920
to pick up, like you're not going to take the time to manually reach down and switch tools.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.400
You're just going to eat it with the fork and the spoon's going to go unused.

23:06.400 --> 23:09.520
Right, that sounds like the perfect solution.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.600
You'll try to eat soup with that fucking fork,

23:11.600 --> 23:14.000
if it means you don't have to go back down and do a switcheroo.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.840
That sounds like the, yes, you're 100% right.

23:17.840 --> 23:18.640
Nailed it.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.440
Nailed it.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.240
Now about 2013.

23:22.240 --> 23:25.440
Now I've seen people say the 20 Bakers does, which I like.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.440
I like that, but like, it's right there.

23:27.440 --> 23:32.240
I don't feel that it has anything contextually to do with any kind of message,

23:32.240 --> 23:36.800
unless our suggestion is that in 2013 everyone should become bakers.

23:36.800 --> 23:44.000
Mm-hmm, my problem with 2013 is that it makes us sound fucking stupid every time we say it.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.480
How many is this, 13?

23:47.680 --> 23:49.760
It is a 13 year.

23:50.400 --> 23:54.160
I don't think we would, I don't think we would say the 20.

23:55.040 --> 23:59.600
Why not just, I mean, before it's 20 does it, and we said 20 does, why not just 20 dirt?

23:59.600 --> 24:02.800
20 dirt, no, I like that.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.360
20 dirt, I like a lot.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.240
I like a lot.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.080
Griffin, how do you feel about 20 dirt?

24:10.160 --> 24:11.840
I don't know how I feel.

24:11.840 --> 24:12.800
It made me giggle.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.000
You feel strongly about it, you just don't know strongly in what way.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.720
I was halfway there with 2013, and Travis had to come take you home to 20 dirt.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.800
Okay, but here's the problem though.

24:22.800 --> 24:26.960
What if someone's dirt is like, I fucked my dog 10 years ago.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.640
Like that dirt, just keep it in.

24:28.640 --> 24:30.480
That's been way out on their shoulders then.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.120
That's been crushing them.

24:33.120 --> 24:37.440
We've always been about honesty, and we've always been about forthrightness, and about

24:37.440 --> 24:42.640
getting it off your chest, and getting it out there, and this is the year that we crystallize

24:42.640 --> 24:48.640
that, formalize it, and euthanize it, and really say, dirt, 20 dirt, get it out.

24:48.640 --> 24:49.440
Get it out.

24:49.440 --> 24:50.400
Get it out in 20 dirt.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.360
Get it out, dig it out.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.680
Dig it up, set it free.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.880
Wash it out, eat it up.

24:57.520 --> 24:58.960
Don't eat it out.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.240
Don't eat it, that's dirty.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.720
Don't eat it out.

25:02.720 --> 25:03.680
Brush it off.

25:03.680 --> 25:04.560
Blow it.

25:04.560 --> 25:04.960
Blow it.

25:04.960 --> 25:05.440
Spray it.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.480
Stop formatting.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.800
Put it back into the NES.

25:08.800 --> 25:09.600
See if it plays.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.040
20 dirt.

25:11.040 --> 25:11.600
20 dirt.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.840
Okay, I'll go there with you.

25:13.840 --> 25:14.320
All right.

25:14.320 --> 25:17.760
I frequent a nearby arcade, and when I'm there, I like to play some of the games that give

25:17.760 --> 25:19.840
tickets or rewards, such as skeeball.

25:19.840 --> 25:24.640
However, as a grown man, I have absolutely no use for these tickets whatsoever.

25:24.640 --> 25:28.080
I usually look for the nearest child at the end of the day, and hand them a fistful of

25:28.080 --> 25:30.400
tickets to brighten their day.

25:30.400 --> 25:34.240
However, I am worried this makes me look like a creeper.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.600
Is it acceptable to do?

25:36.160 --> 25:41.120
Should I just leave the tickets in the machine for kids to stumble upon themselves, or should

25:41.120 --> 25:44.960
I stop doing this entirely and just leave with a handful of spider rings every time?

25:46.160 --> 25:47.760
That's from No Ticky No Problem.

25:48.800 --> 25:49.200
All right.

25:50.080 --> 25:50.400
Okay.

25:51.040 --> 25:52.080
Straight up.

25:52.080 --> 25:52.800
Yeah.

25:52.800 --> 25:57.600
This is one of the problems, I think, of the modern age, and it really frustrates me.

25:57.600 --> 26:02.400
In what way is giving a child the tickets you're not going to use creepy?

26:02.400 --> 26:06.720
Well, Trapp, that is the problem of the modern age, is that everybody thinks that everyone

26:06.720 --> 26:09.680
else is trying to fuck them constantly.

26:10.400 --> 26:10.800
Right?

26:11.600 --> 26:12.800
Constantly.

26:12.800 --> 26:18.400
I was just playing croquet in the park, and a dude walked by with his dog, and I gripped

26:18.400 --> 26:19.360
my mallet.

26:19.360 --> 26:25.440
I gripped my mallet in a stance that made me look threatening in case he tried to come

26:25.440 --> 26:28.720
over and get some touch.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.960
Did you come over and dirty your ascot?

26:30.960 --> 26:33.360
Now, did you spill-

26:33.360 --> 26:34.800
He almost spilled my mimosa.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.120
He almost spilled my cucumber soda.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.280
I'm trying to play croquet over here.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.640
I hand-juiced that.

26:41.520 --> 26:46.160
I think that problem is certainly, certainly exacerbated when you have a child, because

26:46.160 --> 26:50.240
you better believe if I have my child, and I was teaching him the betters of croquet,

26:50.240 --> 26:53.440
I was teaching him the rules and proper etiquette of hammerball.

26:53.440 --> 26:57.120
While still not disturbing the plate of cucumber sandwiches.

26:57.120 --> 26:58.080
Correct.

26:58.080 --> 26:58.880
The croquetiquette.

26:58.880 --> 27:04.160
The croquetiquette of it all, and a person came within my line of sight, I would probably

27:04.160 --> 27:06.560
just chase them down and beat them to death with the hammer.

27:06.560 --> 27:07.060
Yeah.

27:07.600 --> 27:08.080
Yeah.

27:08.080 --> 27:14.400
Now, just so I can double-check, you felt threatened at a moment when you had a giant

27:14.400 --> 27:15.680
wooden hammer in your hand?

27:15.680 --> 27:18.480
Is that, just so I'm clear about the situation you found yourself in?

27:18.480 --> 27:24.240
Mm-hmm, but I was wearing a headscarf to protect myself from the sun's rays.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.920
So the two really cancel each other out.

27:27.920 --> 27:28.320
Right.

27:28.320 --> 27:32.640
You were worried that you might get confused and actually hit him with the parasol you

27:32.640 --> 27:33.600
were holding in your hand.

27:33.600 --> 27:37.280
I was delicately dabbing the corners of my mouth with a pocket square.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.880
You had no free hand to clobber.

27:38.880 --> 27:39.380
Exactly.

27:40.000 --> 27:40.480
I get it.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.240
I was also singing a little song.

27:44.240 --> 27:49.120
I was singing the most flop-ish song I could think of.

27:50.560 --> 27:54.160
You noticed that only one of your loafers actually had a penny slid inside of it.

27:54.160 --> 27:54.800
That's correct.

27:54.800 --> 27:58.240
Made a note to burn them when you got home.

27:59.520 --> 28:04.720
Yeah, I understand why you think it's creepy.

28:04.720 --> 28:11.520
And as much as I'd like to say, well, sorry, society, this seems like one where you just

28:11.520 --> 28:15.920
got to kind of hope that things change, I have two solutions for you.

28:16.640 --> 28:19.280
One, people have had children for worse reasons.

28:20.400 --> 28:23.680
If you have your own kids, then you can give them all your tickets.

28:23.680 --> 28:26.880
People have had kids for worse reasons than that.

28:27.600 --> 28:28.080
Okay?

28:28.080 --> 28:28.880
That's number one.

28:29.680 --> 28:37.280
Number two, there are prizes that every kid goes in and they look and they say, you know,

28:37.280 --> 28:40.880
they play, they had a cast party there, they had a post soccer party.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.400
I know where you're going with this and I love it.

28:42.400 --> 28:45.200
And you look at it and you're like, oh my God, a bike?

28:46.080 --> 28:48.640
Who has enough to get a bike?

28:48.640 --> 28:51.280
There's no way I could ever save up 10,000 tickets.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.720
That's astronomically high.

28:52.720 --> 29:00.160
You could be a guy who comes in one day with a laundry basket full of tickets and dumps

29:00.160 --> 29:03.280
it out and say, I'll take the bike.

29:03.280 --> 29:09.440
And you can ride this stubby little 10-speed out the door while kids are cheering like,

29:09.440 --> 29:11.520
yeah, he did it, this one's for us.

29:11.520 --> 29:15.280
You would take down the bike and there's just like a dirt imprint around it where it's just

29:15.280 --> 29:16.800
been on the wall for so long.

29:16.800 --> 29:22.000
You would be too excited when you handed over that laundry hamper of tickets.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.160
You would be too excited to just say, I'll have the bike.

29:26.160 --> 29:29.520
Like you would involuntarily shout like, eat my dick.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.520
Eat my dick, Tilt.

29:34.320 --> 29:35.360
Give me that shit.

29:36.080 --> 29:36.880
Bike me.

29:36.880 --> 29:43.200
Get it off the wall, bike me, dick.

29:43.200 --> 29:46.800
Or you just go in with your laundry basket, but you're so excited you get all tongue-tied

29:46.800 --> 29:48.400
and you go, all the rings.

29:50.640 --> 29:51.760
It's legally binding.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.360
Once you say it.

29:55.360 --> 29:58.400
I'll have three and a half miles of Laffy Taffy.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.240
Fuck, I love those jokes.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.280
I specifically told myself not to say it.

30:05.280 --> 30:09.520
I was just thinking, don't say that about the Laffy Taffy.

30:09.520 --> 30:13.920
Hey, Dillweed, I'll take the electronic battleship, please.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.160
I'll take the 13-inch-

30:17.520 --> 30:23.120
I'll take the 13-inch TV that you can plug into your cigarette lighter for before.

30:23.120 --> 30:28.640
I think, wasn't it at the pub, Gino's Pub in Huntington, West Virginia.

30:28.640 --> 30:30.800
Wasn't the big prize a Lincoln Town Car?

30:30.800 --> 30:31.840
Or am I making that up?

30:31.840 --> 30:33.040
You are high on-

30:33.040 --> 30:33.920
So fucking high.

30:33.920 --> 30:34.880
No, sir.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.400
There is no thing like that.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.200
Yeah, I swear to-

30:37.200 --> 30:40.880
For 14 and a half million tickets.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.200
I was just there.

30:43.200 --> 30:51.280
Now you do run the risk of, the problem is that arcades in this culture, they're closing.

30:52.320 --> 30:54.640
We just lost Tilt at the Huntington Mall.

30:54.640 --> 30:57.120
What if I had been saving up?

30:57.840 --> 30:59.760
That shit is not transferable.

30:59.760 --> 31:03.760
There's not a Swiss bank account where you can deposit all your tickets

31:03.760 --> 31:05.120
when Tilt goes out of biz.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.880
That's why you go to Mr. Gaddy's.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.600
They accept all tickets at Gaddy's.

31:11.600 --> 31:12.400
They're not choosy.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.400
That's actually their motto.

31:14.400 --> 31:14.800
Fuck it.

31:14.800 --> 31:15.520
We'll take them.

31:15.520 --> 31:16.000
Gaddy's.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.440
Our pizza's garbage, but we'll take your tickets.

31:20.320 --> 31:21.760
All we have is Laffy Taffy, though.

31:22.400 --> 31:27.040
What you definitely don't want to do is leave the tickets in the machine and let kids get them

31:27.040 --> 31:30.080
because you are going to get so many fucking orbits.

31:30.080 --> 31:34.400
You're going to get so many clingers and barnacles that will just like rush in

31:34.400 --> 31:35.680
and then they'll get shitty about it.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.920
They'll just like stand behind you and be like, 900 points, huh?

31:39.920 --> 31:40.560
It's the best you can do.

31:41.120 --> 31:41.600
Scott.

31:42.960 --> 31:45.120
I did have my eye on a slap bracelet.

31:45.920 --> 31:46.880
Thanks, Scott.

31:46.880 --> 31:47.920
Thanks, Scott.

31:47.920 --> 31:51.440
One of those fucking styrofoam airplanes,

31:51.440 --> 31:54.320
but I guess this is just going to go ahead and be the worst birthday ever.

31:54.320 --> 31:54.960
Thanks, Scott.

31:54.960 --> 32:00.640
Scott, sorry you couldn't ski ball better, idiot.

32:00.640 --> 32:01.520
Oh, Scott.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.720
I'll just call my dad and tell him to pick me up now, Scott,

32:04.720 --> 32:07.600
because this obviously isn't your hot day, Scott.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.680
You could just tear them up in front of the kids.

32:15.680 --> 32:16.480
Oh, man.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.760
Just burn them in the park.

32:19.760 --> 32:21.440
What a power play that is.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.880
Hey, kids, come over to the parking lot.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.560
I got something I want to show you.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.560
Look at all these tickets I've collected.

32:27.520 --> 32:30.160
Well, if you're worried about creeping kids out,

32:30.160 --> 32:33.840
I think walking backwards with a fistful of tickets into the parking lot,

32:33.840 --> 32:35.760
screaming, follow me into the parking lot.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.480
That dog probably won't like it.

32:38.480 --> 32:39.280
And the liar.

32:40.320 --> 32:41.040
Come on, kids.

32:42.080 --> 32:46.800
You could pile them up in your back seat and have a lot of awkward conversations.

32:47.680 --> 32:48.960
You want some tickets?

32:48.960 --> 32:51.440
Did you want some tickets for next time?

32:52.240 --> 32:53.200
You know what would actually be great?

32:53.200 --> 32:54.080
What?

32:54.080 --> 32:57.120
I mean, it would be better if we thought of this a month ago,

32:57.120 --> 32:58.640
but like a tree garland.

33:00.160 --> 33:00.640
Beautiful.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.320
That would be very nice.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.360
That would be tasteful.

33:03.360 --> 33:07.760
You know, at the Geno's Pub and Family Fun Center on Fifth Avenue,

33:08.320 --> 33:10.800
you can't give the guy tickets.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.040
The guy won't count your tickets.

33:13.040 --> 33:13.280
Right.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.320
You have to feed them.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.440
The magic counter thing.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.040
Yeah, you got to feed them in the machine.

33:17.040 --> 33:17.600
Do you know why?

33:17.600 --> 33:25.120
Why? Because we're living in a really bad time period where hard work is not valued.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.920
Well, and also because that man doesn't know maths.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.320
Hey, I used to be that man.

33:30.320 --> 33:30.560
Yeah.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.160
Fair enough.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.760
We need to move on.

33:36.400 --> 33:37.600
Do we want to go?

33:37.600 --> 33:51.040
Yeah, let's count all the money that we made.

33:51.040 --> 33:52.320
Who's in our magic mirror today?

33:52.320 --> 33:53.600
Who's getting a special treatment?

33:54.240 --> 33:56.880
I'm throwing it out to Joshua Colt Kelly.

33:56.880 --> 33:57.920
Cool name, Josh.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.600
I think he has to be a cowboy with that name.

34:01.600 --> 34:04.080
With a name like that, he's like a train robber.

34:04.080 --> 34:07.920
Fucking three people that are trying to get in,

34:07.920 --> 34:09.680
and I think they're trying to cram it on us.

34:09.680 --> 34:12.080
To Joshua Kelly and Colt from Three Ninjas?

34:12.720 --> 34:14.640
Or Colt McCoy, the football man.

34:16.160 --> 34:18.240
There's a football man named Colt McCoy.

34:18.240 --> 34:21.920
This message comes from Britt, Cam, Adam, Yasir, and Jones.

34:21.920 --> 34:26.080
I'm telling you, two of those people know Josh, one knows Colt, and two know Kelly.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.280
I'm telling you, we are getting fucked.

34:27.280 --> 34:28.720
Why are you shortchanging Colt?

34:29.440 --> 34:30.560
Colt might know all of them.

34:30.560 --> 34:34.560
Maybe one of them knows Josh and Kelly, and the rest are friends with Colt,

34:34.560 --> 34:36.560
and they're like, well, if you want to get on the Colt train.

34:36.560 --> 34:41.680
Now, this is, okay, this is answered in the next section.

34:41.680 --> 34:45.120
Happy birthday, Josh, from Britt, Cam, Adam, Yasir, and Jones.

34:45.120 --> 34:48.560
Please enjoy these finely crafted jokes we've purchased for you.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.720
Brothers, make funny goos, especially Griffin.

34:51.280 --> 34:54.320
Oh, there's like, this is an instruction here.

34:54.320 --> 34:57.680
Now, I want to point out, we got a follow-up email to correct the fact

34:57.680 --> 35:03.200
that they spelled it crafted, but that's all I can think of

35:03.200 --> 35:06.880
from this entire email is finely crafted jokes.

35:07.760 --> 35:10.240
I'm just thinking about how we're getting shortchanged.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.920
If you guys just make this right, send us like an extra,

35:13.920 --> 35:16.080
an extra few Benjis and we'll be cool.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.040
Toss a few Benjis our way and we'll be straight.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.200
Just give us some tiny famous dogs.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.720
Speaking of tiny famous dogs.

35:22.720 --> 35:28.000
ExtremeRestraints.com is your home for bone.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.960
It's a new thing I came up with.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.400
Your home for bone.

35:32.400 --> 35:39.120
This is the one day of the week when I get to go to a site with naked ladies on it

35:39.120 --> 35:42.560
and my wife can't get mad when she checks my eye history.

35:43.760 --> 35:48.320
When you say eye history, do you mean she has doctor skills to go in

35:48.320 --> 35:50.560
and look at everything you looked at with your eyes?

35:50.560 --> 35:52.400
Yes, exactly, precisely.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.400
Bondage bedsheets.

35:54.400 --> 36:01.200
It may be a way for you and your partner to start exploring the exciting world of S&M

36:01.200 --> 36:06.880
that you may have heard of in the hit novel, 50 Shades of Grey.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.640
Isn't every bedsheet a bondage?

36:08.640 --> 36:10.400
I almost said Eat, Pray, Love.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.560
The author of Eat, Pray, Love listens to our podcast.

36:14.560 --> 36:16.960
The hit psychosex rom.

36:16.960 --> 36:20.960
The hit psychosexual Eat, Pray, Love.

36:22.960 --> 36:28.320
Elizabeth Gilbert, if you have managed to stick with it and are still listening,

36:28.320 --> 36:32.960
consider, I'm not telling you how to do your work because you're obviously very good at it,

36:32.960 --> 36:36.720
but if you could work some crazy fucking into the next book.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.720
Maybe like Eat, Pray, Love, Sexing.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.560
Eat, Pray, Love, This Butthole.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.240
Eat, Pray, Love, Shower.

36:44.240 --> 36:52.560
The Handy Snatch Masturbator is a mouthful to say and a dickful to have sex with.

36:54.720 --> 36:57.440
Oh man, I thought I could finish it, but this is a dickful.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.920
My dick is bigger than my eyes or something.

37:03.040 --> 37:07.280
I am stuffed into this realistic feeling latex.

37:07.280 --> 37:10.880
Ladies, I don't mean to brag, but my dick's bigger than my eyes.

37:10.880 --> 37:15.920
If you put them together, it would be bigger than the two of them.

37:17.120 --> 37:21.600
Then there's the Mouth Thruster Masturbator, which is just a mouth and a tongue.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.800
It's kind of horrifying, like a cast off from Mominshans.

37:26.160 --> 37:31.200
You can put your finger in it or something that's not your finger, where the P comes out.

37:31.200 --> 37:35.200
You can get all of this and more at extremistchase.com, and if you use the coupon

37:35.200 --> 37:40.800

37:40.800 --> 37:42.960

37:42.960 --> 37:44.720
Guys, you're welcome.

37:44.720 --> 37:45.440
You're welcome.

37:45.440 --> 37:49.840
Good Extreme Restraints ads from this show is like slam poetry.

37:49.840 --> 37:58.080
Like when we are on and like the cadence of it is, ah, the meter, it's poignant and powerful.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.480
This is breaking, just breaking, breaking in.

38:04.480 --> 38:05.280
Come in, come in.

38:05.280 --> 38:05.920
Can you read me?

38:05.920 --> 38:06.480
Can you read me?

38:08.320 --> 38:09.120
This is urgent.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.960
Urgent dispatch about Michael Keaton.

38:14.640 --> 38:18.880
Got a Keaton update for you from Sam coming in latest work from Sam.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.400
He says, I just listened to the candlelight podcast where you're asking about the whereabouts

38:22.400 --> 38:23.280
of Michael Keaton.

38:23.280 --> 38:27.280
I work at an actual food store in Bozeman, Montana, where he frequently shops when he

38:27.280 --> 38:31.360
is in Montana at his ranch at the Paradise Valley, about 40 miles from Bozeman.

38:31.360 --> 38:34.320
Although I do not know him personally, he seems to be doing fine.

38:34.320 --> 38:38.000
He's still buying expensive food, such as fish that cost 25 pounds.

38:42.000 --> 38:47.920
I did want to take a quick, quick break from my break to say, is there not some sort of

38:49.760 --> 38:52.880
fish selling fish purchaser confidentiality here?

38:52.880 --> 38:56.400
Is this not a private exchange when I went at the natural food store?

38:56.400 --> 39:01.200
More importantly, what the fuck kind of fish costs $25 a pound?

39:01.200 --> 39:04.400
I'll take two pounds of the goldfish, please.

39:04.400 --> 39:04.640
Yeah.

39:06.320 --> 39:10.000
He comes in with a ball cap and sunglasses no matter what time of day.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.800
Despite the picture I'm paying of him, he's actually a really nice guy.

39:12.800 --> 39:13.280
Courteous.

39:13.280 --> 39:15.200
He looks you in the eye when speaking to him.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.880
As far as his work record, I know he was in the other guys and that is the most recent

39:18.880 --> 39:20.720
thing I can remember, which is in 2010.

39:20.720 --> 39:24.240
Just want to give you the info on the little bit I know about Michael Keaton to help you

39:24.240 --> 39:24.960
sleep at night.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.160
That's from Sam.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.960
Sam, thank you for that Keaton update.

39:28.960 --> 39:33.840
If you are, if you are in a position to update us on Michael Keaton's whereabouts, we would

39:33.840 --> 39:34.800
ask that you please do it.

39:34.800 --> 39:35.680
I mean, I don't.

39:35.680 --> 39:38.640
I've got a big map on the wall and I'm putting push pins in it.

39:38.640 --> 39:41.600
So far I've got one in Bozeman, Montana.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.640
So I don't want to, I don't want to show two in Gotham.

39:44.640 --> 39:52.000
I don't, I don't want to show what seems to be a very promising bit, but I saw that

39:52.000 --> 39:56.080
motherfucker on the silver screen in a trailer for the new Superman movie plays Superman's

39:56.080 --> 40:00.400
Dad. You dumb motherfucker.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.960
Do you mean Kevin Costner?

40:02.960 --> 40:04.800
Now, listen to what I did.

40:04.800 --> 40:05.760
Listen to what I did.

40:05.760 --> 40:06.400
Listen to what I did.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.040
Hold on.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.600
Can I, can you give me two minutes to do six degrees?

40:13.520 --> 40:16.320
Michael Keaton was in the Keaton-Costner transposition.

40:16.320 --> 40:19.440
Keaton was in Batman.

40:19.440 --> 40:20.080
The first Batman.

40:20.080 --> 40:20.880
Okay.

40:20.880 --> 40:21.600
Got it.

40:21.600 --> 40:27.600
With Jack Nichols, Flapjack Nicholsack.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.480
Jack Nichols, he's in with the Golden Bear.

40:33.680 --> 40:36.160
Flapjack was in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

40:36.160 --> 40:36.640
I'm done.

40:37.760 --> 40:38.080
Okay.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.360
I did, real quick, I did want to double check this.

40:41.920 --> 40:48.720
So I went to IMDB and the most recent things I've looked at are Jonathan Taylor Thomas,

40:48.720 --> 40:51.680
Michael Keaton, apparently.

40:51.680 --> 40:54.080
Justin Tone, Sidewalk of Stars.

40:55.040 --> 40:58.080
I only use IMDB when I'm doing this show.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.440
And when he's worried about the safety of an actor.

41:01.440 --> 41:02.800
Just want to make sure he's okay.

41:03.440 --> 41:07.120
Don't you guys worry about like, like we got worried about French tour and then he made a

41:07.120 --> 41:07.520
comeback.

41:07.520 --> 41:08.560
He made a big comeback.

41:09.120 --> 41:13.120
I'm actually, I'm very ashamed of how often I use IMDB to check to see if someone has

41:13.120 --> 41:15.120
died in the last year or not and I just missed it.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.040
It happens a lot.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.040
You should, you should, you should probably be.

41:19.040 --> 41:20.560
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

41:20.560 --> 41:21.840
Yeah, yeah, I do.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.400
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

41:24.400 --> 41:27.520
By the way, everybody sent in really great questions this week.

41:27.520 --> 41:32.480
Like I got a ton of really good submissions, but I've only read two Ira Rays in a row,

41:32.480 --> 41:33.920
but that's just because they're really good.

41:34.800 --> 41:35.600
Thank you Ira Ray.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.600
It's by Yahoo Answers User Question Mark who asks,

41:39.680 --> 41:45.120
is it weird that my BF wants a puppet show for his 30th birthday?

41:45.120 --> 41:47.120
Whoa.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.640
He's never wanted anything before and if I ever ask, he says nothing.

41:51.200 --> 41:55.680
But today he said very seriously that he would love so much to have a puppet string,

41:55.680 --> 41:58.640
a string puppet show performed for his birthday.

41:58.640 --> 42:01.360
Should I book him one or is it weird for him to want that?

42:02.960 --> 42:03.600
Oh my God.

42:03.600 --> 42:04.560
What if it's a test?

42:06.800 --> 42:09.040
Or what if he's just a psychopath?

42:09.040 --> 42:11.440
Which seems like one of those two.

42:11.440 --> 42:18.160
I've never, Diane, I've never asked you for anything, but I'm turning 30 and I'm gonna

42:18.160 --> 42:19.520
blow it out in style.

42:21.120 --> 42:29.120
I want to have a man put his hand in some socks and entertain me and all my closest friends.

42:30.160 --> 42:31.840
Bring me some napery.

42:34.800 --> 42:37.440
Bring me a foppish fuzz.

42:37.440 --> 42:39.280
Go down to the corner.

42:39.280 --> 42:41.680
Bring me the Punch and Judy man.

42:41.680 --> 42:45.280
Have him come here and entertain me with a show.

42:45.280 --> 42:47.520
What do you mean that's not a thing?

42:47.520 --> 42:48.640
That's not a thing.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.200
What isn't this Victorian England?

42:52.000 --> 42:53.920
I can just picture Diane just every day.

42:53.920 --> 42:54.560
What do you want?

42:54.560 --> 42:55.440
What do you want?

42:55.440 --> 42:56.080
What do you want?

42:56.080 --> 42:56.880
What do you want?

42:56.880 --> 42:57.760
What do you want?

42:57.760 --> 42:58.480
What do you want?

42:58.480 --> 43:00.720
I want nothing for 29 years.

43:00.720 --> 43:02.560
For 29 years, nothing.

43:02.560 --> 43:04.800
And then he goes, okay, you want to know?

43:04.800 --> 43:05.360
You want to know?

43:05.920 --> 43:06.480
Puppet.

43:06.480 --> 43:09.840
Go into the street and bring me a jacket ape.

43:09.840 --> 43:13.200
I shall instruct him in the ways.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.920
Maybe her constant badgering has just broken his mind.

43:17.920 --> 43:18.420
Yeah.

43:20.160 --> 43:28.480
To me, the upsettingness of puppets is inversely proportionate to the extent to which I can

43:28.480 --> 43:29.440
see the puppeteer.

43:30.240 --> 43:32.640
If I can't see the puppeteer at all, fine.

43:32.640 --> 43:33.760
Take me away.

43:33.760 --> 43:37.200
You know, like King Friday in the land of make-believe.

43:37.200 --> 43:38.480
Like, that's fine.

43:38.480 --> 43:39.680
Whisk me away.

43:39.680 --> 43:47.440
If I can see a grown adult man manipulating this cloth and trying to trick me, I hate that.

43:47.440 --> 43:50.160
So you had huge problems with, like, Welcome to Weinerville.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.760
Pretty sure everybody has huge problems with Weinerville.

43:54.320 --> 44:01.280
Justin, can I ask, is your deep-seated hatred of visible puppetry, does it boil down to

44:01.280 --> 44:04.720
the fact that you just don't like seeing people do anything?

44:06.480 --> 44:11.360
Is it your problem with interacting with people that are doing things that you are watching?

44:12.080 --> 44:16.480
Griffin, I sometimes have a problem with social cues.

44:16.480 --> 44:16.960
Right.

44:16.960 --> 44:21.360
Like, I don't know, I'm in a conversation or a social scenario, and I don't exactly

44:21.360 --> 44:24.720
know the right thing to say in that exact situation.

44:24.720 --> 44:31.520
Now, if you can just blow that up and think, like, in what scenario would you have the least

44:31.520 --> 44:33.120
chance of saying the right thing?

44:33.120 --> 44:38.480
And I think it's when you make eye contact with a man whose hand is in felt.

44:38.480 --> 44:38.800
Yeah.

44:38.800 --> 44:42.480
Like, that is the number one situation, which, like, I don't know what to say to you.

44:42.480 --> 44:44.400
You're pretending to talk me through a puppet.

44:44.400 --> 44:47.600
It also boils down to the fact that they are trying to trick you.

44:48.240 --> 44:49.440
They really are trying to trick me.

44:49.440 --> 44:51.360
They're lying to you, is what they're doing.

44:51.360 --> 44:53.360
They're saying, look at these two small men.

44:53.360 --> 44:55.040
And I'm-

44:55.040 --> 44:57.360
I'm trying to get the dirt out over here, and you're trying to make more dirt?

44:57.360 --> 44:58.480
This is Tony Dirt.

44:58.480 --> 45:01.440
And what you're doing is you're scooping more piles on, sir.

45:02.880 --> 45:06.400
Why don't we just cut through the bullshit, and you tell me the story directly?

45:06.400 --> 45:06.720
Yeah.

45:06.720 --> 45:07.600
How about you sit us down-

45:07.600 --> 45:09.040
Cut out the tiny middle man.

45:09.920 --> 45:14.000
Why are you so afraid of committing to this conversation we're having?

45:14.000 --> 45:16.160
Just weave me a tale with your words.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.560
And your Weinerville puppets.

45:18.560 --> 45:19.840
And your Weinerville puppets.

45:19.840 --> 45:20.640
Is leaving the Weinerville-

45:20.640 --> 45:22.400
Which I mean puppetry of the penis.

45:22.400 --> 45:29.760
Can one of you guys use your IMDb wizardry to quickly and discreetly find out how many

45:29.760 --> 45:31.520
seasons of Weinerville there were?

45:31.520 --> 45:34.240
And if anyone I know was ever on Weinerville?

45:34.960 --> 45:37.520
Yeah, Matthew Weiner, the creator of Mad Men.

45:38.560 --> 45:40.080
He was the one behind it.

45:40.080 --> 45:41.120
I don't think that's true.

45:42.720 --> 45:45.600
Okay, so they did 62 episodes of Weinerville.

45:46.160 --> 45:48.240
Almost enough for Cindy.

45:48.240 --> 45:49.680
Almost enough for Cindy.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.680
Almost didn't get quite to Cindy.

45:51.680 --> 45:54.160
We made it to Cindy almost twice now.

45:54.160 --> 45:56.000
I guess a little bit more than once now.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.520
And Weinerville couldn't crest it.

45:57.520 --> 45:59.600
But I think that might just be because we

45:59.600 --> 46:03.520
don't have tiny impotent bodies attached to our chins.

46:04.240 --> 46:04.480
Yeah.

46:05.760 --> 46:09.920
Well, Mark Weiner was a writer for Saturday Night Live.

46:10.720 --> 46:14.640
Yeah, and he kept saying, I'd like to be on the show, but just my head.

46:15.280 --> 46:17.120
They're like, that's impossible.

46:17.120 --> 46:18.640
I got a great idea for a sketch.

46:18.640 --> 46:22.880
You are going to try and throw this ping-pong ball using a tiny puppet hand

46:22.880 --> 46:24.080
that we've attached to your chin.

46:24.080 --> 46:25.680
And it's going to be fucking hilarious.

46:26.480 --> 46:30.480
Oh, he's also the voice of Mapp and Swiper the Fox on Dora the Explorer.

46:30.480 --> 46:31.760
Well, there you go.

46:31.760 --> 46:37.360
On Nes Declassified School Survival Guide, he is credited as Mr. Weiner.

46:37.360 --> 46:41.520
And I think I might have discovered Mark Weiner's problem with his career.

46:41.520 --> 46:47.120
He refuses to appear on television unless his character makes use of his

46:47.120 --> 46:48.640
hilarious surname.

46:50.800 --> 46:51.280
What's the name?

46:51.280 --> 46:52.160
What's the character's name?

46:54.480 --> 46:56.800
No, is it Tony Soprano?

46:56.800 --> 46:58.240
I've got a better idea.

46:58.240 --> 46:59.360
Let me hit you with this.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.520
How about Tony Weiner?

47:01.520 --> 47:02.960
How about Don Draper?

47:02.960 --> 47:03.440
No.

47:03.440 --> 47:04.080
How about this?

47:04.080 --> 47:05.280
How about Don Weiner?

47:05.280 --> 47:08.080
But also, have you thought about making your body real small and weird?

47:09.840 --> 47:14.240
I can't believe we just fucking, what fucking obscure Nickelodeon game show

47:14.240 --> 47:19.120
have we not discussed in length on this podcast program?

47:19.120 --> 47:21.440
I think they would actually have to pre-date your birth.

47:21.440 --> 47:23.360
Like, I think I would have to dip into like-

47:23.360 --> 47:24.000
Picture Perfect?

47:24.000 --> 47:26.560
Pinwheel, sorry?

47:26.560 --> 47:27.840
Picture Perfect?

47:27.840 --> 47:31.200
What was the one where they had the house and they had to go through

47:31.200 --> 47:32.560
and they had to like find the differences?

47:32.560 --> 47:33.520
That's finder-

47:33.520 --> 47:40.080
Okay, you have maybe conflated finder's keepers and picture pages-

47:40.080 --> 47:40.480
Picture pages.

47:40.480 --> 47:41.520
... hosted by Bill Cosby.

47:41.520 --> 47:42.240
Fuck me.

47:42.240 --> 47:42.800
What was the one-

47:42.800 --> 47:44.960
Have we done Legends of the Hidden Temple yet?

47:45.520 --> 47:46.240
We have to have.

47:46.240 --> 47:48.400
I went and sat at it for Halloween when we were doing this.

47:48.400 --> 47:49.440
I'm sure we discussed it.

47:49.440 --> 47:52.320
What was the one with the squares, the TV squares,

47:52.320 --> 47:54.560
and you would unveil them and they would make a picture?

47:54.560 --> 47:56.960
What was the My Brother, My Brother, Me when I stopped listening?

47:58.800 --> 48:04.320
I think it was the one where they just didn't make any jokes for like 20 minutes.

48:04.320 --> 48:05.440
Just named all the different-

48:05.440 --> 48:06.960
They just said titles of shows.

48:06.960 --> 48:08.800
Well, let's bring it to now.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.080
Let's bring it to today.

48:10.080 --> 48:13.840
Because how come every show on Nickelodeon is about teens trying to fuck each other?

48:13.840 --> 48:14.400
Huh?

48:14.400 --> 48:17.600
And how come it's not about them trying to figure out television riddles?

48:17.600 --> 48:19.280
And none of them have tiny bodies.

48:19.280 --> 48:22.640
None of them have tiny bodies and none of them say wiener unless they're saying,

48:22.640 --> 48:24.160
hey John, I want to suck your wiener.

48:24.160 --> 48:25.840
I'm a 15-year-old girl.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.200
It's disgusting.

48:27.200 --> 48:28.240
When I was a child-

48:29.440 --> 48:30.560
I behaved as a child.

48:30.560 --> 48:34.560
I behaved as a child and I watched The Adventures of the Little Prince,

48:34.560 --> 48:37.280
Picture Pages, Belle and Sebastian, Danger Mouse,

48:37.280 --> 48:40.800
and Curious George, and so many others when I was a child.

48:41.680 --> 48:44.960
And then, and like, and the shows used to be so good.

48:44.960 --> 48:51.520
Guys remember like, Are You Afraid of the Dark and Sleuth Shorts and Clarissa and Welcome Freshmen and Hey Dude?

48:51.520 --> 48:54.240
Do you think Linda Ellerby was ever like, hey, you want to fuck?

48:54.240 --> 48:55.120
Of course not.

48:55.120 --> 48:58.080
She wanted to talk to you about the news, the important issues to you.

48:58.080 --> 48:58.800
She wanted to-

48:58.800 --> 49:00.400
She cared about global warming and shit.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.640
She wanted to open up about the cancer that she beat.

49:02.640 --> 49:07.040
And like, and now I have to watch Drake and Josh try to open up about it.

49:07.040 --> 49:09.520
Try to have sex with each other or something.

49:09.520 --> 49:10.640
I don't watch that show either.

49:10.640 --> 49:13.440
But like, it sounds like that's what's happening.

49:14.160 --> 49:16.400
It did seem like Moe was trying to party though.

49:17.120 --> 49:18.160
Moe was down to party.

49:18.160 --> 49:19.760
She laid it on just a little thick.

49:20.400 --> 49:23.680
I wanted to talk about a glowing piece of that radical rock.

49:23.680 --> 49:27.680
And she wanted to talk about a glowing piece of my radical cock.

49:27.680 --> 49:28.320
There it is.

49:28.320 --> 49:28.640
Thank you.

49:29.280 --> 49:29.840
Sure.

49:29.840 --> 49:30.320
Why not?

49:31.520 --> 49:33.680
There are several, several great reasons why not.

49:33.680 --> 49:37.280
Yeah, many, including time and size.

49:39.360 --> 49:40.000
Spatial.

49:40.000 --> 49:40.960
Mainly spatial.

49:41.600 --> 49:45.200
Spatial ratios to physical space right now.

49:45.200 --> 49:46.480
And time, chrono-

49:46.480 --> 49:47.440
And confetti.

49:47.440 --> 49:50.880
And it was full of jets of confetti, which is not positive.

49:51.920 --> 49:53.280
There are chrono-spatial reasons.

49:53.280 --> 49:54.480
Oh, oh, sorry, baby.

49:54.480 --> 49:56.080
Looks like you missed an actuator.

49:58.480 --> 49:59.600
Hold on, hold on.

49:59.600 --> 50:01.680
Inside my desk, I put this in here yesterday.

50:01.680 --> 50:02.960
It's a sealed envelope.

50:02.960 --> 50:04.160
Let me just open it up real quick.

50:04.720 --> 50:06.400
On this piece of paper, I wrote,

50:06.400 --> 50:09.600
we are going to talk about literally fucking the aggro crag.

50:10.560 --> 50:11.760
I predicted it.

50:11.760 --> 50:13.040
I mailed this to myself.

50:13.760 --> 50:17.520
What an odd power you've been given.

50:19.280 --> 50:25.600
So that's just a little sampling of my brother, my brother, and me for you.

50:25.600 --> 50:27.520
That's kind of a thing we do here.

50:27.520 --> 50:31.040
Whatever that was that you just listened to, that's pretty much what we do.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.120
And we're sorry.

50:33.120 --> 50:35.600
And we're sorry you've heard it now and you can't unhear it.

50:35.600 --> 50:37.680
So maybe you should just hear more of it.

50:37.680 --> 50:41.120
Maybe you'll come back around on the other end.

50:42.080 --> 50:43.360
Thank you for listening, though.

50:44.160 --> 50:53.600
Thank you to people tweeting about the show, like Happy Bob, Eric Nottenrice.

50:54.160 --> 50:55.360
Man, that's a mouthful.

50:55.360 --> 50:56.080
I don't know.

50:56.080 --> 50:58.240
Brandon McStamm, Note in Color, The Davenporter,

50:58.240 --> 51:02.240
J. Ryan Johnson, Iggy K. Kuber, Kuber, sorry, Jacob Blocker,

51:03.600 --> 51:07.600
Para Delonian, Logan Bonner, David Fave.

51:07.600 --> 51:09.680
Thank you guys for tweeting about our program.

51:09.680 --> 51:12.320
It really means a lot to us.

51:12.320 --> 51:19.360
And if you want to spread the show even more, tweet about our sampler bit.ly forward slash

51:19.360 --> 51:20.400
it's b-b-bam.

51:20.400 --> 51:25.120
It would be great if 20 dirt was the year that we fucking exploded.

51:25.120 --> 51:26.160
Wouldn't that be great?

51:26.160 --> 51:30.880
Like, I, I'd love like publicity wise, not like physically, not physically, but I would

51:30.880 --> 51:35.760
love it if like we like became like if we became like the new Drake and Josh.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.200
Only there would have to be a third one.

51:37.200 --> 51:38.240
Blake and Drake and Josh.

51:39.520 --> 51:43.040
I would love it if like Michael Keaton started asking about what we were up to.

51:43.040 --> 51:44.080
Yeah, yeah.

51:45.040 --> 51:47.040
Why doesn't he want to start on our life story?

51:47.040 --> 51:51.200
They there's obviously a bunch of them because they were in multiplicity.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.200
So he could do that.

51:53.200 --> 51:59.680
With Michael Keaton as Justin, Michael Keaton as Travis, and introducing Michael Keaton

51:59.680 --> 52:00.720
as Griffin.

52:00.720 --> 52:02.800
And as Clint McElroy, Rachel Billson.

52:03.920 --> 52:05.440
Because why the fuck not?

52:05.440 --> 52:06.480
Because why not?

52:06.480 --> 52:07.920
Never going to happen anyway.

52:08.720 --> 52:10.720
And Eddie Murphy plays everyone else.

52:10.720 --> 52:12.400
We're going to toil at obscurity.

52:12.400 --> 52:14.320
Jesse Thorne played by Eddie Murphy.

52:16.480 --> 52:18.720
Eddie Murphy as Simon Thorne also.

52:18.720 --> 52:20.080
And they talk about it a lot.

52:20.080 --> 52:23.760
Eddie Murphy as Simon Thorne also, and they talk to each other.

52:23.760 --> 52:24.880
It's amazing.

52:24.880 --> 52:26.640
It's the best scene in the whole fucking movie.

52:27.600 --> 52:29.520
Eddie Murphy played by Michael Keaton.

52:30.480 --> 52:31.520
As Michael Keaton.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.040
What haven't we mentioned?

52:37.040 --> 52:40.160
Oh, go to maximumfun.org and listen to all the other shows there.

52:40.160 --> 52:41.120

52:46.800 --> 52:47.680

Risk, Memory Palace.

52:48.880 --> 52:49.120
Batman.

52:49.120 --> 52:50.800

52:50.800 --> 52:51.360
Batman.

52:51.360 --> 52:51.920
Batman.

52:51.920 --> 52:52.800

53:03.440 --> 53:04.400
I want to thank John Roderick.

53:04.400 --> 53:04.960
Special thanks.

53:04.960 --> 53:05.600
Oh, damn.

53:05.600 --> 53:06.800
And I was going to do it this week.

53:06.800 --> 53:07.760
I want to thank John Roderick.

53:07.760 --> 53:08.480
Do you want to do it?

53:09.200 --> 53:10.240
I mean, I've never done it.

53:10.240 --> 53:10.480
Go for it.

53:10.480 --> 53:10.960
Give it a try.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.360
I want to thank John Roderick.

53:13.360 --> 53:14.080
You're yelling.

53:14.080 --> 53:14.580
Boo.

53:17.680 --> 53:18.320
Go ahead.

53:18.320 --> 53:21.840
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winners for the use of our theme song,

53:21.840 --> 53:23.840
It's a Departure, off the album Put in the Days to Bed.

53:23.840 --> 53:25.760
You can find that on iTunes and buy it.

53:26.880 --> 53:32.960
Justin got me the John Roderick, John Colton Christmas album, one Christmas at a time.

53:32.960 --> 53:36.480
And inside the box is a candy cane and some gelt.

53:36.480 --> 53:40.240
And I don't know if they're actually good to eat because it came in a box that you got

53:40.240 --> 53:42.320
shipped to Amazon and then gave to me.

53:42.320 --> 53:44.080
I think those are good for like ever.

53:44.080 --> 53:44.480
OK.

53:44.480 --> 53:45.920
Well, I'll give it a try and I'll report back.

53:45.920 --> 53:48.960
This final Yahoo answer was also sent in by Ira Ray.

53:48.960 --> 53:49.680
Thank you so much.

53:50.720 --> 53:54.160
It's by Yahoo Answers user, you don't even know, who asks,

53:56.160 --> 53:59.520
how did Fred Savage go back in time to narrate himself?

54:02.800 --> 54:04.000
I'm Justin McElroy.

54:04.000 --> 54:04.960
I'm Kevin Feinberg.

54:04.960 --> 54:06.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.120
This has been my brother, my brother.

54:07.120 --> 54:16.720
And may you kiss your dad square on the lips.
