00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:45.920 --> 00:49.680
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

00:49.680 --> 00:54.320
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.000
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:59.120 --> 01:04.720
Ladies and gentlemen, I am so pleased to be the ones to reveal to everyone who didn't watch the

01:04.720 --> 01:11.440
Super Bowl last night that Spuds McKenzie is back. He's back. Yeah, Spuds is back. Big dog.

01:11.440 --> 01:18.160
The big dog is back, and he's starring in like the only commercial that like did something.

01:18.720 --> 01:23.280
It was like the only commercial that I remember because it had a dog that drank beer, which is

01:23.280 --> 01:28.880
very, very good. Very good. It's very, very good stuff, and every other commercial was like,

01:29.600 --> 01:36.160
oh no, my dumb ugly brother turned into a babe because of this product.

01:36.160 --> 01:43.920
Ha ha ha. Tight. My brother's so smoking hot now. So congratulations, Spuds McKenzie,

01:43.920 --> 01:47.600
and whatever beer product I don't quite remember you represent because you've won it.

01:47.600 --> 01:52.480
You won the big game. But it's easy to remember because the name's right in there sort of.

01:52.480 --> 01:59.680
No, that's not it. I'm pretty sure it's Yuengling. I think it's McKenzie. I think it's big dog beer.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.400
I think it's called big dog beer. That's right, Travis, because it tastes

02:02.400 --> 02:07.600
so bad, and dogs will drink it, too. That's the flavor profile.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.640
It's actually made for dogs. That's what most people don't know.

02:10.640 --> 02:13.200
But humans can drink it, too. That's Spuds' tagline.

02:14.640 --> 02:19.840
So Spuds McKenzie was created in 1987. Everybody got very upset.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.040
So was I.

02:21.040 --> 02:25.760
Yeah, exactly. Everybody got very upset about Spuds McKenzie because they thought that it was

02:25.760 --> 02:34.720
marketing beer to kids because it was a shale-fun dog, right? And they retired Spuds in 1989

02:35.840 --> 02:40.800
because there was a lot of controversy that this was targeted at kids.

02:41.600 --> 02:48.640
So that seems silly, but then Spuds McKenzie shows back up in 2017, and I was nine when he

02:48.640 --> 02:54.320
went off the air, and I was pretty fucking stoked to see Spuds McKenzie. So there is a chance that

02:54.320 --> 03:00.160
maybe he did, in fact, have a large market impact on America's youth.

03:00.160 --> 03:06.720
To be fair, credit where credit is due, though, I did appreciate how this time they made sure

03:07.280 --> 03:13.680
that this Spuds McKenzie commercial was not for kids, that this was for adults only,

03:13.680 --> 03:16.000
and it was just a lot of dog boners.

03:17.360 --> 03:21.600
A lot of dog hogs. That is a good point, Travis. And I was made uncomfortable by

03:21.600 --> 03:25.360
the many dog penises, and I looked away and I made my family look away.

03:26.480 --> 03:31.200
Tone Loke's song, Funky Cold Medina, lists Spuds McKenzie as one of the dogs trying to get into

03:31.200 --> 03:34.880
his house. So now that's another one for Tone.

03:34.880 --> 03:38.640
I don't remember Funky Cold Medina having that much plot in it.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.200
Yeah, there's a long plot of Funky Cold Medina.

03:43.200 --> 03:48.800
Is there a verse that's just like, and then I shut the door, and then it's not a problem anymore

03:48.800 --> 03:53.040
because dogs can't get through doors unless they have a special door installed in the door.

03:53.040 --> 03:53.440
And I don't have it.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.240
My god, the window. I forgot to close it.

03:56.240 --> 04:00.880
It's actually kind of an epic poem, really. It's the Gilgamesh of our time.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.160
The harpies crashed my boat.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.720
Oh, what? Why are you on a boat now?

04:06.720 --> 04:09.680
The fleece was mine. Wild thing.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.840
We weren't fooled, Tone. We weren't fooled.

04:13.840 --> 04:17.360
We weren't fooled by your theft, by your beat theft.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.240
How about that football game, too?

04:20.240 --> 04:24.960
Because a lot of people were confused during the point where they lost the ball

04:26.000 --> 04:29.200
and they couldn't play for a little bit because the ball was gone.

04:29.200 --> 04:29.760
You remember?

04:31.120 --> 04:33.840
I guess one of the boys threw the football super hard and then like,

04:34.960 --> 04:39.360
and I was watching on the camera, they had all those wonderful cameras filming it.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.840
And I swear to God, I just couldn't see where the ball went.

04:41.840 --> 04:45.040
And then they couldn't play for a while until somebody ran into Toys R Us and bought a new

04:45.040 --> 04:45.840
football.

04:45.840 --> 04:49.040
You know, Griffin, the craziest part of the game to me,

04:49.600 --> 04:51.920
what I thought, what I thought was the craziest part,

04:51.920 --> 04:58.800
where the game ended in a tie and the Birdmen and the American soldier men,

04:58.800 --> 05:00.240
they were like, we did great.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.320
Everybody played good in it.

05:02.320 --> 05:06.400
And they shook hands and they were back in their locker rooms getting changed.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.240
Some of them were already in their khakis.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.600
And then like somebody ran in, they're like, wait, wait, wait.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.960
We just checked the rule book.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.000
We have to keep going.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.320
And it can't end in a tie.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.200
And they were like, what?

05:17.920 --> 05:19.280
Yeah, you have to keep playing.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.000
And so half of them were still out in their khakis and polos,

05:22.640 --> 05:24.240
exchanging Christmas gifts.

05:24.240 --> 05:24.800
Yeah.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.560
And then they were like, OK, well, let's play some more.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.760
Sorry, Justin makes a good point that the season goes through Christmas.

05:29.760 --> 05:33.360
So they don't get to celebrate Christmas until after the Super Bowl.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.440
And it's really, where's that movie?

05:35.440 --> 05:36.480
It's Super Bowl Christmas.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.520
Where's that film?

05:37.520 --> 05:38.480
That's what I want to see.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.920
So yeah, I remember now Travis hearing about it in the news.

05:41.920 --> 05:42.800
They ran in the locker room.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.000
They're like, it can't end in a tie.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.520
And they're like, well, this is unprecedented.

05:45.520 --> 05:46.000
What should we do?

05:46.000 --> 05:46.960
And they're like, I don't know.

05:46.960 --> 05:51.040
We could flip a coin to decide the fate of the final football game.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.560
Are you sure that's a good idea?

05:52.560 --> 05:54.000
Yeah, let's just flip a coin.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.120
It's like the last football game and the whole planet is watching

05:57.120 --> 05:59.440
and other planets are also tuned in.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.040
And yeah, we got a tie on our hands.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.880
Let's just flip an old coin.

06:02.880 --> 06:06.560
We're going to let one of you boys try to do a touchdown.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.600
And the other guy's like, can we try to do it too?

06:09.600 --> 06:12.160
No, sorry, they guessed which side the coin would be on

06:12.160 --> 06:13.360
because it's football.

06:13.360 --> 06:14.800
It's football, you know?

06:15.680 --> 06:16.800
I did like how they did it.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.560
It was just a one-on-one touch.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.120
So one guy with the ball, one guy trying to stop him.

06:21.120 --> 06:25.520
It was like some like NFL, you know, like 2K sports kind of stuff

06:25.520 --> 06:28.160
where just one guy were running and the other guy chasing him.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.640
And he did get in the touchdown zone.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.520
He did get in there.

06:31.520 --> 06:31.760
Yeah.

06:32.560 --> 06:36.160
Spencer Kinsey's real name was Honey Tree Evil Eye.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.400
And she was from Pennsylvania.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.000
Holy fucking shit.

06:40.000 --> 06:40.720
It was a lady.

06:40.720 --> 06:41.440
Did you know that?

06:41.440 --> 06:42.080
A lady dog.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.680
Spud McKenzie was a lady dog named Honey Tree Evil Eye.

06:45.680 --> 06:51.040
Do you think that they cast a lady dog so that they wouldn't have to deal with dog boners?

06:51.040 --> 06:52.000
With the dicks, yeah.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.720
That seems like a 100% probability scraps.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.120
I would put that on 100.

06:57.120 --> 06:57.680
Yes.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.720
I love he's the original party animal and I loved it.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.600
He just loved the party and he was out there having good times

07:03.600 --> 07:04.960
and he cared about friends.

07:04.960 --> 07:09.360
It was weird to me the overtly sexual attention

07:09.360 --> 07:13.600
that Spud McKenzie received from ladies in print ads.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.880
That seemed troubling.

07:16.880 --> 07:17.920
Yeah, she loved him.

07:17.920 --> 07:18.640
They loved him.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.160
Yeah, but it's still a dog.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.120
It's not like Joe Camel where it's an anthropomorphicized camel.

07:23.120 --> 07:23.600
Oh, yeah.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.840
I'll fuck Joe Camel for sure.

07:25.840 --> 07:26.080
Right.

07:26.080 --> 07:31.920
I thought that Lady Gaga's performance in the middle of the game was a big surprise.

07:32.560 --> 07:35.760
Very few people saw that coming that she was going to show up

07:35.760 --> 07:38.000
and put on a little concert for everybody.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.720
I love the duet between her and Spud McKenzie.

07:40.720 --> 07:40.960
Yes.

07:43.600 --> 07:47.600
Which it was scary at first because at first they thought it was just a wild dog storming the field

07:47.600 --> 07:49.680
so they tried to shoot the dog.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.560
But this is no dog's purpose.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.920
He avoided all of the shots and he got up on stage

07:55.920 --> 07:58.800
and Lady Gaga was like, please stop shooting at me and this dog

07:58.800 --> 08:00.400
and then they sang all their songs.

08:00.400 --> 08:04.560
Wasn't expecting Lady Gaga's performance which was fucking phenomenal

08:04.560 --> 08:06.720
to be quite such a stunt spectacular

08:06.720 --> 08:09.280
because boy, she just kept jumping off of things.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.280
Do you think that there was someone when she jumped off the top of the arena who went,

08:13.280 --> 08:15.920
well, that's the end of the show, I guess.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.640
Is this art?

08:16.640 --> 08:18.240
Is this part of the performance art?

08:18.800 --> 08:19.600
Jesus.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.800
She also had a flotilla of robots at her command

08:22.800 --> 08:26.720
and if I had given you an infinite amount of time,

08:26.720 --> 08:29.280
if you put a bunch of monkeys in a room with typewriters

08:29.280 --> 08:32.240
and given them an infinite amount of time to guess what Lady Gaga would do

08:32.240 --> 08:34.560
with a flotilla of robots at her command,

08:34.560 --> 08:38.240
I bet pretty low on the list would be form an American flag

08:38.240 --> 08:40.160
and then later the Pepsi logo.

08:40.160 --> 08:44.960
It seems like that would not be how Gaga would use her flotilla of robots.

08:44.960 --> 08:48.880
No, I mean, she would basically be like a fucking Call of Duty villain.

08:49.920 --> 08:53.840
She would fucking use those drones to take over the Pentagon or something like that.

08:53.840 --> 08:54.880
This is Gaga's country.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.880
This is one nation under Gaga now.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.280
When she jumped, there was this moment where I was like,

09:00.000 --> 09:03.200
are they gonna form a fucking glider underneath her?

09:03.200 --> 09:04.880
Like Green Goblin style?

09:04.880 --> 09:05.680
Oh my.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.400
I was so excited.

09:06.400 --> 09:07.680
Megamind shit.

09:07.680 --> 09:08.640
Yeah, exactly.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.840
I was so excited.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.920
But no, no big gray six action.

09:11.920 --> 09:12.560
Oh man.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.520
Travis just made a dope Megamind, Paul.

09:17.520 --> 09:18.880
I love Megamind.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.240
This is a good movie, man.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.000
You didn't get the press it deserved.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.560
You've got to Megamind, dude.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.160
That flick though.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.000
Can we do a retroactive Megamind watch?

09:28.880 --> 09:30.880
Hell yeah, anytime.

09:30.880 --> 09:31.840
Go watch Megamind.

09:31.840 --> 09:32.800
It's great.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.160
Oh, hell yeah, dude.

09:34.880 --> 09:38.560
Megamind at one point puts on a hologram that for some reason,

09:38.560 --> 09:40.800
inexplicably looks like Greg Kinnear.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.160
Like almost exactly like Greg Kinnear.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.280
Aw, sick.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.480
Never addressed.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.320
There's Neil Young's song.

09:46.320 --> 09:50.080
It's the anti-sellout anthem called This Note's For You.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.880
Obviously parodying the Budweiser thing.

09:52.880 --> 09:58.080
And Neil Young says he ain't singing for Spuds in the title track of the album.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.280
Man, Neil Young, you really fucking stuck at the Spuds McKenzie.

10:01.280 --> 10:06.000
Damn Neil, you really made me think about some stuff by slamming that beer dog.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.680
I really need to reevaluate some stuff because Neil put forward another thinker.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.200
You really put that fucking dog on blast.

10:16.320 --> 10:17.360
You taught that dog.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.640
Can we do the stuff that we do?

10:21.280 --> 10:23.360
Griffin Spuds McKenzie is back.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.360
I know and I'm fucking feeling it.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.880
I had a hard time sleeping last night.

10:26.880 --> 10:27.840
You don't remember it.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.000
Of course I remember it.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.200
It's a dog that likes to party on beer with friends.

10:34.800 --> 10:41.360
There is a pretty good, though, like in an alternate reality where Spuds McKenzie did

10:41.360 --> 10:46.400
not exist in 1987 to 1989 and he just appeared last night.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.120
That ad would have set the world on fire.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.280
Are you kidding me?

10:51.280 --> 10:52.880
Why is the dog a ghost?

10:52.880 --> 10:53.840
Why is he talking?

10:53.840 --> 10:55.280
Why does he drink beer?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.040
Why does he want you to party with your buds?

10:57.040 --> 10:58.080
I do not understand.

10:58.080 --> 10:58.640
Hi, kids.

10:58.640 --> 11:01.520
This is three old man macros talking to you now.

11:01.520 --> 11:08.000
There was a time in America where an animal was your go-to beer selling device.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.320
For example, three frogs, each one saying Budweiser.

11:12.320 --> 11:16.640
Doesn't sound funny to you now, but back in our day, that was the shit.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.240
It was on t-shirts.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.000
Everybody referenced it everywhere.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.360
There was the Coors Light Snake and he would just show up and you would reach into your

11:25.360 --> 11:30.880
fridge and you would be like, time for a nice, crisp, natural light.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.400
Ow, fuck!

11:32.400 --> 11:33.440
And then you would pull back your hand.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.360
You have been bitten and you die.

11:35.360 --> 11:38.080
And then it is sort of a morality tale.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.840
I believe Coors Light had a wolf.

11:40.800 --> 11:41.520
Yeah, a sweet wolf.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.080
Pretty sure.

11:42.080 --> 11:45.120
It is just, I am looking at Wikipedia now.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.720
It is just the Coors Snake.

11:46.720 --> 11:51.760
You know, I am just now realizing that the Budweiser frogs were referenced in our television

11:51.760 --> 11:53.360
program and Spuds McKenzie wasn't.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.040
So there goes another shot of relevance.

11:55.040 --> 11:55.440
Fuck.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.440
That we could have, oh well.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.440
Let's please God.

11:59.440 --> 12:00.400
Okay, we are not going to have another one of those shows.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.000
He was just called Beer Wolf?

12:03.360 --> 12:04.640
Sorry, what?

12:04.640 --> 12:07.040
The Coors Light Wolf was just called Beer Wolf.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.040
Beer Wolf?

12:09.040 --> 12:10.960
I think it was supposed to be a play on Werewolf.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.440
He started up his own podcast network.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.640
For somebody who has never heard it said out loud.

12:16.640 --> 12:17.520
I think so.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.160
Beer Wolf?

12:20.160 --> 12:21.680
That is kind of like, oh well.

12:22.880 --> 12:23.280
All right, Beer Wolf.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.840
And Beer Wolf came out before Spuds McKenzie.

12:25.840 --> 12:30.240
So Spuds McKenzie was the Hydrox or the Oreo or whatever.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.640
Hey guys, I am a huge Space Jam fan.

12:34.640 --> 12:35.040
Fuck yeah.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.320
And for Christmas, my friend ordered me a Michael Jordan Space Jam jersey.

12:38.320 --> 12:42.400
However, he lives across our big ass state and while the jersey was supposed to arrive

12:42.400 --> 12:43.600
while I was visiting, it didn't.

12:44.160 --> 12:49.600
He said he will mail it to me when it arrives, but now it is February and still no Space Jam jersey.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.360
I really want this jersey.

12:51.360 --> 12:55.680
So how do I ask him the status of my Christmas gift without sounding like a greedy asshole?

12:55.680 --> 12:57.040
That's Hannah from Texas.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.760
You gotta get this jersey.

12:59.760 --> 13:00.960
You gotta get the jersey.

13:00.960 --> 13:01.920
You gotta get the jersey.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.440
You gotta get it.

13:03.440 --> 13:10.800
There's no social faux pas too great if it ends with you wearing the Space Jam,

13:10.800 --> 13:13.360
Toon Squad, Jordan jersey.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.840
Holy shit, that's a good look though.

13:15.840 --> 13:16.800
That's a good look.

13:16.800 --> 13:22.240
Can you imagine like rolling up to like your your weekly just like pick up basketball game?

13:22.240 --> 13:23.520
Oh, but what's that?

13:23.520 --> 13:26.400
You have a sweet ass new Space Jam jersey?

13:26.400 --> 13:27.840
Yeah, I don't want to play with you.

13:27.840 --> 13:31.120
You have cartoon stretch powers and that's absolutely cheating.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.280
I won't be party to that.

13:33.280 --> 13:38.720
Could you tell your friend that you're trying to line up your Halloween costume a little

13:38.720 --> 13:44.800
early this year and you just want to confirm thumbs up or thumbs down status of the jersey?

13:44.800 --> 13:50.000
Hmm, I mean you could also just tell them that since you told me that this thing exists

13:50.000 --> 13:54.720
and it belongs to me, my life has been spent in anguish every moment that I know it's

13:54.720 --> 13:59.840
mine but I do not have it and the only way to bring peace to my troubled mind is for

13:59.840 --> 14:05.600
you to either come to me and give me the jersey personally or mail it right now and I will

14:05.600 --> 14:07.040
Venmo you some cash.

14:07.600 --> 14:12.080
That seems like a pretty good actually like I don't think it's rude to let your friend

14:12.080 --> 14:15.920
know that your frothing demand increases for this jersey.

14:15.920 --> 14:19.280
Like you only, this is all you can think about.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.520
Please, please release me from this prison.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.040
It's all I can think about.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.120
Please, why have you done this to me?

14:25.120 --> 14:31.520
What if you get the jersey and you had to work so hard you did drive all the way from

14:33.040 --> 14:39.040
you know, from East Texas behind the Pine Curtain all the way over to Amarillo and you're

14:39.040 --> 14:43.680
like I've made my journey, I finished my quest, let me get that jersey and you open

14:43.680 --> 14:50.480
it up and you look at the back and it says Jorbin on it and you're like who would make

14:50.480 --> 14:50.960
this?

14:50.960 --> 14:55.200
Who would even make, who would print this jersey out and be like yeah, thank you for

14:55.200 --> 14:57.120
calling Toon Squad Jersey Manufacturing.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.400
This is Greg, how can I help you?

14:58.960 --> 15:02.320
And you're like let me get one that says Jorbin on it and you're like are you sure

15:02.320 --> 15:07.360
because I've seen the movie many times and we kind of make, we kind of make like novelty.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.720
You sure Jorbin?

15:08.720 --> 15:11.520
Yeah, that was the man's name Michael Jorbin number 26.

15:13.120 --> 15:17.680
And you get so mad and you throw it in fire and you scream at your friend only to them

15:17.680 --> 15:22.480
find out that that was a limited edition like misprint that's worth a million dollars.

15:22.480 --> 15:28.720
Or not, his name really is Michael Jorbin and we've all been saying it wrong this whole

15:28.720 --> 15:31.360
time but he's a very polite man.

15:32.720 --> 15:33.600
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

15:34.240 --> 15:37.280
Are you worried about Space Jam 2 in that?

15:37.280 --> 15:38.960
No, just hold on a second.

15:38.960 --> 15:42.720
Now just hold on one second, just one second.

15:42.720 --> 15:46.720
Justin's about to say something super important and we almost missed it.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.000
No, I'm serious.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.280
This is very important.

15:49.280 --> 15:59.040
I'm a little worried that our social media just existences once Space Jam 2 becomes closer

15:59.040 --> 16:02.000
to fruition is just going to become untenable.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.120
Oh, I've been thinking about leaving Twitter for quite some time and I think that's going

16:05.120 --> 16:07.120
to be the ol' escape pod.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.400
It's going to be the one, right?

16:08.400 --> 16:13.120
Because it's just going to be a lot of people tweeting Space Jam 2 information at us pretty

16:13.120 --> 16:14.080
much constantly.

16:14.080 --> 16:20.320
Yeah, maybe we should just start like a separate account that's just for people to tweet Space

16:20.320 --> 16:22.160
Jam 2 information too.

16:22.160 --> 16:26.560
Right, and it insta-deletes the tweets after they're sent.

16:27.360 --> 16:28.400
Okay, Griffin, I'm ready for that Yahoo.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.920
Here it comes and it's from Rachel Rosen, game recognized game.

16:31.920 --> 16:32.480
Thank you, Rachel.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.680
It's Yahoo Answers user.

16:33.680 --> 16:44.000
They are anonymous, but their name is Jorban asks, why do most butlers came from England?

16:45.680 --> 16:47.840
Why do most butlers came from England?

16:47.840 --> 16:51.040
No additional details provided or required.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.120
Hey, what's up?

16:53.120 --> 17:00.080
My name's Stevie and I'm here to polish your China.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.440
So what do you got?

17:01.440 --> 17:02.240
Some silverware?

17:02.240 --> 17:02.800
Let me see that.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.640
Rub, rub, rub.

17:04.640 --> 17:05.120
Got it.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.640
My name's Stevie, by the way.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.160
I am from Minneapolis.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.720
Okay, straight talk.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.480
Real question here, brothers.

17:13.200 --> 17:17.840
Have you in your lives ever actually encountered a butler?

17:17.840 --> 17:18.560
Ah, geez.

17:19.360 --> 17:22.560
A personal physical encounter with a butler.

17:22.560 --> 17:28.480
Like you've gone to someone's home and the door was opened by like an Alfred Pennyworth

17:28.480 --> 17:29.280
looking dude.

17:29.280 --> 17:34.800
Dude, we're not talking about like a, you know, a person you hire to help clean or whatever.

17:34.800 --> 17:39.680
You're talking about an actual like besuited butler.

17:39.680 --> 17:45.200
Yeah, this is a person who like lives in the home, who like answers the door and brings

17:45.200 --> 17:49.280
people to the parlor to meet the master of the house.

17:50.560 --> 17:51.200
I guess not.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.240
Pretty much no.

17:55.040 --> 17:55.760
No, right?

17:55.760 --> 17:58.960
I don't know that they exist.

17:58.960 --> 17:59.920
I don't think I've been told.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.440
No, they do exist.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.760
I watched this amazing show called You Can't Get the Help.

18:05.200 --> 18:09.520
It was from England, but it was a react.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.320
Yeah, exactly.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.200
There's a long tradition there of this sort of thing.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.480
I think culturally people understand it better there.

18:17.120 --> 18:20.720
I'm just going to say the butlers are better in Britain is what I'm going to say.

18:20.720 --> 18:23.600
Wow, I happen to think American butlers are the best.

18:23.600 --> 18:24.320
I mean, we don't know.

18:24.320 --> 18:24.720
We don't know.

18:24.720 --> 18:25.520
They don't exist.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.400
Yeah, that's the thing.

18:27.760 --> 18:33.920
One of the episodes I watched, this is your fella, this old fella, was trying to find someone

18:33.920 --> 18:38.640
to take care of his weapon collection, who could like really do it up right, like all

18:38.640 --> 18:39.840
his Asian weapons.

18:39.840 --> 18:47.280
And it was pretty much, the episode was pretty much this stream of young men coming in wanting

18:47.280 --> 18:52.720
to check out old weapons and him like grilling them about how sweet they were and then echoing

18:52.720 --> 18:57.280
that like they are in fact sweet and here's some sweet and like how you would swing them

18:57.280 --> 18:58.480
and stuff like that.

18:58.480 --> 18:58.800
Wow.

18:58.800 --> 19:04.000
And then like quizzing them on their application of how sweet they were to swing to be able

19:04.000 --> 19:05.840
to use these ancient weapons.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.040
That's a cool life.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.080
It's a cool life.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.920
That's a cool life you put together there for yourself.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.000
Congratulations to you.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.280
Can I become the world's first American butler?

19:16.480 --> 19:18.480
I think I'd be pretty good at it.

19:18.480 --> 19:20.080
You've got so much to overcome.

19:20.720 --> 19:21.440
I don't think so.

19:21.440 --> 19:25.280
I like nice things and I like people who like nice things and I think I can I think I can

19:25.280 --> 19:26.560
help their things seem nicer.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.240
That's what that's what a butler does, right?

19:28.240 --> 19:30.800
They like, hello, I'm here to make the things seem nicer.

19:31.680 --> 19:34.240
But say that in an American accent, Griffin.

19:34.240 --> 19:34.960
Oh, hey, what's up?

19:34.960 --> 19:35.360
I'm Griffin.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.440
I'm here to make your things seem nicer.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.080
No, you're not.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.040
You're here to rob me.

19:39.040 --> 19:39.840
Get out.

19:39.840 --> 19:40.320
No, I'm not.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.040
Look at my suit.

19:41.040 --> 19:41.840
Look at my cool suit.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.960
Look at my little mustache.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.000
It's fun and flirty.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.040
Let me inside and I'll make your things seem nicer.

19:47.040 --> 19:47.920
Yeah, come on.

19:47.920 --> 19:48.400
Come on.

19:48.400 --> 19:48.880
What are you doing?

19:48.880 --> 19:49.360
What are you doing?

19:49.360 --> 19:50.960
Oh, you're having friends over for chili.

19:50.960 --> 19:51.840
Hi, welcome.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.040
I'm Griffin, the butler.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.160
Please come in for chili.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.680
They've sold teens.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.120
Let's get you out of those wet clothes.

19:58.400 --> 19:58.800
Hold on.

19:58.800 --> 20:08.320
So the reason that we don't I think the reason that we have not encountered an American butler

20:08.320 --> 20:14.800
is in our day to day is like it would be I would think fairly expensive to keep a human

20:14.800 --> 20:16.160
on retainer, right?

20:16.160 --> 20:22.320
Like to keep a person who lives at your house and does it for you would be expensive, right?

20:22.320 --> 20:22.720
Yeah.

20:22.720 --> 20:23.280
Yes.

20:23.280 --> 20:27.440
Bob euchre's character was a sports writer and his wife went to law school.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.480
What in the living fuck are they doing with a butler?

20:32.480 --> 20:34.000
First of any butler.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.720
But it's like fucking like class distinction.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.520
And also warm hearted, if I may, Mr.

20:41.520 --> 20:46.720
Belvedere, I do not understand how they are affording Mr. Belvedere level talent on a

20:46.720 --> 20:47.840
sports writer salary.

20:47.840 --> 20:48.320
It does.

20:48.320 --> 20:52.560
I cannot and his wife is racking up law school bills and she's like, yeah, I love one.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.680
I love a butler.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.360
I assume an inheritance.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.840
Is that an inherit Mr.

20:57.840 --> 20:58.720
Belvedere?

20:58.720 --> 21:00.080
That seems okay.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.160
I thought inheritance of money.

21:02.160 --> 21:06.320
But now that you mentioned it, maybe, maybe Mr.

21:06.320 --> 21:13.520
Butler served euchre senior inventor of the card game where all of his money came from.

21:13.520 --> 21:16.480
And then he just passed Mr.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.800
Belvedere down to his son, Bob.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.000
I'd rather not know.

21:20.000 --> 21:20.640
Come on.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.640
Well, there's streaks on all the China.

21:22.640 --> 21:26.880
I know I was not crazy about this, but when I saw the fucking streaks on the China, I

21:26.880 --> 21:29.360
was like, I got to get in there and do my shit.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.240
Gonna get nasty on them.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.240
I don't I just don't get it.

21:34.240 --> 21:37.840
Like they just put that up there and expected us to all sort of swallow it.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.360
And I don't understand.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.280
It doesn't make sense how they could afford Mr.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.080
Belvedere.

21:42.080 --> 21:42.800
I don't get it.

21:42.800 --> 21:46.480
I might get on some love actually shit here for a second, but you know how when British

21:46.480 --> 21:50.320
people are in America and they talk, people like, that's fancy.

21:51.120 --> 21:54.400
And so that I think that's why I think that's why we make that association.

21:54.400 --> 21:59.520
I think the reverse would be true where if I went to London and I was like, hey, what's

21:59.520 --> 21:59.680
up?

21:59.680 --> 22:00.320
I'm a butler.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.280
They would hear my particular manner of speech.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.680
And it would be like, that's a fancy boy.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.120
Gotta have him in my house.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.760
Gotta have him, you know, waxing my cars and teaching my kids some valuable lessons.

22:11.760 --> 22:15.680
That's what that's what was meaningful to me is I would show up and I would make I

22:15.680 --> 22:18.800
would invite people into the parlor and I would like help them throw great parties.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.440
But then the kids would come to me and be like, I don't know about school.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.520
And I'd be like, fucking tell me about it, dude.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.360
And then they would be enriched.

22:25.360 --> 22:30.160
And you teach them like skateboard and skateboard and be cool and how to like smoke.

22:31.120 --> 22:31.920
Yeah.

22:31.920 --> 22:35.280
I just want to know where to find an American butler.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.240
I just won't.

22:36.240 --> 22:41.600
I just want to know about one American butler or maybe one of us could become the first.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.640
I would hire Griffin as my butler.

22:44.640 --> 22:45.760
Yeah, thanks.

22:45.760 --> 22:47.360
This would be a pretty good butler.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.000
I know.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.960
That's what I'm saying.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.200
Because I'll do whatever the fuck.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.080
Yeah, I won't complain, you know, whatever the fuck.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.120
How is a butler different from a valet?

22:57.840 --> 22:58.720
They're not.

22:58.720 --> 22:59.520
I'm not.

22:59.520 --> 23:00.480
I'm both.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.440
You can fire me whenever you want to and I will not make a big deal out of it.

23:03.440 --> 23:04.960
That's like my number one thing.

23:04.960 --> 23:08.480
Like this is, I'm at your leisure and then I'm gone.

23:08.480 --> 23:09.280
Bye.

23:09.280 --> 23:10.480
Richie Rich had a butler.

23:10.480 --> 23:11.600
He's American, isn't he?

23:12.240 --> 23:15.920
I want to seriously, I want to put you guys in the headspace for a second there.

23:15.920 --> 23:20.320
Imagine for Christmas that I said, I am buying you one year of butler.

23:20.320 --> 23:23.040
You each open the envelope and it's just a name.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.360
It's like Figginsworth.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.280
Mr. Figginsworth is coming to your house, okay?

23:27.280 --> 23:28.000
Yeah.

23:28.000 --> 23:35.120
Can you imagine just from like a social anxiety, can you imagine the mental math knowing as

23:35.120 --> 23:36.400
what you do today?

23:36.400 --> 23:37.920
Mr. Figginsworth shows up today.

23:37.920 --> 23:41.360
Can you imagine the mental math you would have to run every time?

23:41.360 --> 23:43.040
I would never ask him to do anything.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.920
No, another plate of pizza rolls, sir.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.360
Yes, thank you, Figginsworth.

23:47.920 --> 23:48.800
I wouldn't know.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.920
Can I ask him to clean the windows?

23:49.920 --> 23:50.880
I have no fucking clue.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.240
Can I ask him to go get my coat?

23:52.240 --> 23:52.960
It's right upstairs.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.240
I just got to get it myself.

23:54.240 --> 23:59.040
Shall I change the rechargeable batteries in your Xbox controller, sir?

23:59.040 --> 24:00.160
Yes, thank you.

24:00.160 --> 24:04.160
The only impact he would have on my house is like I would have to open up another account

24:04.160 --> 24:06.640
on Netflix so he could have like his own shit.

24:06.640 --> 24:10.000
Because other than that, I cannot fathom worldwide ask him to do anything.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.800
I would have the confidence to ask him to do anything.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.760
No, I'll get that, Figginsworth.

24:15.760 --> 24:16.960
Can I do your dishes, Figginsworth?

24:16.960 --> 24:18.160
Please, please, please.

24:18.160 --> 24:18.880
It's fine.

24:18.880 --> 24:19.920
You always do it.

24:19.920 --> 24:22.480
Well, sir, you always do it, Figginsworth.

24:22.480 --> 24:22.980
Figginsworth.

24:23.920 --> 24:24.560
Take a break.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.240
It's your day, Figginsworth.

24:26.240 --> 24:26.800
Today's your day.

24:26.800 --> 24:27.920
What do you want to do?

24:27.920 --> 24:28.800
I'm your butler.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.400
Look at the chore wheel, Figginsworth.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.200
It's your day off.

24:32.240 --> 24:33.840
Go fly a kite.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.080
Go buy and fly a kite, Figginsworth.

24:36.080 --> 24:36.880
Here's some money.

24:37.920 --> 24:38.880
I love you, Figginsworth.

24:38.880 --> 24:39.680
Hey, hey.

24:39.680 --> 24:40.960
I love you, Figginsworth.

24:40.960 --> 24:41.460
Love you.

24:42.640 --> 24:43.200
Love you.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.440
Sorry I didn't ask you to do anything this month.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.240
Maybe next month.

24:46.240 --> 24:46.880
Maybe next month.

24:46.880 --> 24:47.920
You'll get there, sir.

24:48.720 --> 24:49.760
Thank you, Figginsworth.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.480
Would you like me to ask me to do stuff for you, sir?

24:52.480 --> 24:53.040
Yes, please.

24:53.040 --> 24:53.760
That would be great.

24:53.760 --> 24:54.080
Yeah, that'd be great.

24:55.360 --> 24:59.600
The thing about butlers they don't tell you is that they have to take their time off while

24:59.600 --> 25:00.640
you're sleeping.

25:00.640 --> 25:04.880
So if you go to sleep, that's when the butler really can play.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.720
And if you hear him roaming around your house sometimes, that's just because that's the only

25:08.720 --> 25:09.520
free time he gets.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.200
So he's got to make the most of it.

25:11.200 --> 25:11.700
Yeah.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.080
Did you beat Dishonored 2 while I was asleep?

25:16.080 --> 25:16.720
Yes, sir.

25:16.720 --> 25:17.920
I was playing that.

25:17.920 --> 25:18.560
I was playing that.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.760
You jumped onto my save.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.560
I took care of it for you, sir.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.200
Well, it's like I didn't need you to.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.840
I mean, I was struggling in that segment.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.520
Oh, you brought it down to low chaos?

25:29.520 --> 25:30.400
Nice.

25:30.400 --> 25:30.880
Nice.

25:30.880 --> 25:31.200
Yes.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.640
Lord Gregory dies at the end.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.680
No, Figginsworth.

25:35.680 --> 25:36.640
Figginsworth.

25:36.640 --> 25:37.680
You're fired.

25:37.680 --> 25:38.240
No, sir.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.600
No, please.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.320
Not like this.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.720
Here's another question.

25:44.720 --> 25:51.360
I was just informed a woman I know is throwing a, quote, play party, aka a swinger sex party,

25:51.360 --> 25:52.400
and I wasn't invited.

25:53.360 --> 25:56.640
There does not exist a reality in which I'd actually want to go to this party.

25:56.640 --> 26:00.480
However, she invited several of my friends and I didn't make the cut.

26:00.480 --> 26:04.240
And I'm left wondering if this is because she views me as an introverted, awkward,

26:04.240 --> 26:07.600
prude, and not the potentially sexy, fun-loving lady that I am.

26:07.600 --> 26:13.440
How can I better exude a invite me to your orgy, I don't want to go vibe without being

26:13.440 --> 26:14.880
a creepy weirdo?

26:14.880 --> 26:18.720
And that's from Brooding on the Bacchanalia Blacklist.

26:18.720 --> 26:22.320
I don't get this question even a little bit at all.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.760
I love this question.

26:23.760 --> 26:24.800
Let me tell you why.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.000
Okay.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.080
This person is bummed that they did not get invited to a party they don't want to go to.

26:30.080 --> 26:30.880
Yeah, that's the thing.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.160
If you take all the sex out of it, that's what it boils down to.

26:34.160 --> 26:41.280
If somebody invited me to go to a swinger sex party, I would say no, thank you.

26:41.280 --> 26:45.520
And I would feel kind of uncomfortable having to turn down that invite for anything.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.200
It's not because of the subject matter of the party.

26:47.200 --> 26:51.760
It's just like, when you have to turn down an invite to anything, it is a discomfort.

26:51.760 --> 26:57.440
When somebody scopes out my situation and says, I absolutely should not invite Griffin

26:57.440 --> 26:59.680
to this because he would have to say no to that.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.800
They have done me a wonderful service.

27:02.800 --> 27:07.840
And I can't imagine- this is such a high stakes invite, are you fucking kidding me?

27:07.840 --> 27:13.120
To have to turn this down would be- would be really rough stuff.

27:13.120 --> 27:16.720
This is such a great service this person has done for you.

27:16.720 --> 27:17.600
Yeah, they've done you a kindness.

27:17.600 --> 27:21.120
You also- you don't want to be the person at an orgy that's the pity invite.

27:21.760 --> 27:22.640
You know what I mean?

27:22.640 --> 27:24.000
That's a real bummer.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.960
It's just like- it's just- I'm going to go out on a limb here, and I'm going to invite

27:28.960 --> 27:32.640
you to this very personal pan party.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.320
And it's very personal, and I'm going out on a limb.

27:36.320 --> 27:39.440
Do you want to come to the sex party?

27:39.440 --> 27:40.400
Uh, no.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.200
Ah, shit.

27:41.200 --> 27:44.000
I wish I hadn't invited you to the personal pan sex party.

27:45.600 --> 27:45.840
Like-

27:45.840 --> 27:48.400
They do need a designated watcher and everyone though.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.480
Maybe that's something you could volunteer for.

27:50.480 --> 27:53.680
Just the person who watches all the sex- sex stuff happening.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.960
Yeah, and puts, you know, number stickers on everybody to tell them how good they're

27:56.960 --> 27:57.280
doing.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.600
Or you could just be like in the coat check.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.680
Yeah, you could do coat check.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.720
I don't understand-

28:02.720 --> 28:04.640
Or maybe just send an edible arrangement.

28:04.640 --> 28:05.200
You know what I mean?

28:05.200 --> 28:06.480
I couldn't make it.

28:06.480 --> 28:07.200
Apologies.

28:07.200 --> 28:11.600
You- you are the sort of person that- you are the sort of person that wouldn't want

28:11.600 --> 28:12.880
to go to an orgy.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.440
You weren't invited to the orgy.

28:15.440 --> 28:16.960
It's a fucking- your friend nailed it.

28:16.960 --> 28:17.760
Slam dunk.

28:17.760 --> 28:18.560
They crushed it.

28:18.560 --> 28:19.120
Slam dunk.

28:19.120 --> 28:22.240
We're going to get another- we're going to get an email from their friend that's just

28:22.240 --> 28:23.680
like, hey, I fucking crushed it.

28:23.680 --> 28:24.720
No advice needed.

28:24.720 --> 28:29.440
I fucking crushed it with the e-vites on this fucking- I sent out some fun jib jab

28:29.440 --> 28:33.280
e-vites to my orgy, and I fucking crushed it with who I invited.

28:33.280 --> 28:36.240
I got a 100% yes, 0% no rating.

28:36.240 --> 28:39.520
I thought about my friend Stacy, but then I was like, nah, she doesn't seem like she'd

28:39.520 --> 28:43.360
be down, and I saved us both a really uncomfortable no to that.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.560
So yeah, 100% e-vite.

28:44.560 --> 28:45.360
Just wanted to brag.

28:45.360 --> 28:45.840
Crushed it.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.120
JibJab.com go.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.400
Great comedy source.

28:48.400 --> 28:52.480
What we're dealing with here is like a Venn diagram with a very, very, very, very small

28:52.480 --> 28:58.240
overlap, and one says people who don't want to go to orgies, and the other circle says

28:58.800 --> 29:01.440
people who want to be invited to orgies.

29:01.440 --> 29:06.800
And you are the one person in the overlap that exists.

29:06.800 --> 29:13.440
I think there's a delineation between orgy and swing or sex party.

29:13.440 --> 29:16.000
I just want to make sure that we acknowledge that there is that.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.200
We understand there's a difference.

29:17.200 --> 29:20.080
It's just like we're trying to use efficiency of language here, okay?

29:20.080 --> 29:20.480
Fine.

29:20.480 --> 29:21.040
We get it.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.160
I have a speech impediment.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.840
I'm not very good with my S's, so I like to stick with non-S words.

29:25.840 --> 29:26.880
Thank you very much.

29:26.880 --> 29:32.400
There are no, there's no like, there's no judgment here at all, 100%.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.440
This is fantastic.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.800
I'm so glad it's happening.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.200
Go America or whatever country this is happening in.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.480
I do have an issue.

29:40.240 --> 29:43.680
Why do you know about this party?

29:43.680 --> 29:49.600
Someone at some point is doing this so fucking wrong.

29:49.600 --> 29:54.400
To me, you just, it's just implied.

29:54.400 --> 29:59.360
Obviously, you don't tell people that you're going to a fun sex party

29:59.360 --> 30:00.640
with some people they know.

30:02.640 --> 30:03.760
It's not, it is not a judge.

30:03.760 --> 30:08.480
I don't think it's a judgment thing as much as like, it's just more fun that way.

30:08.480 --> 30:09.920
It's just not done.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.440
It's just, it's unprecedented.

30:11.440 --> 30:16.160
Any party, especially if you're, because this is how I imagine the invite goes.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.600
It's like a one-on-one.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.680
It's not like you stand up in the break room and go,

30:19.680 --> 30:24.240
hey, by the way, having a party later, if anybody wants to come.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.280
So clearly in this one-on-one invite,

30:27.280 --> 30:31.040
you know that there's some exclusionary tactics happening here.

30:31.600 --> 30:35.040
So for you to then, on any party, go around being like,

30:35.040 --> 30:36.800
yeah, got invited to a party.

30:36.800 --> 30:37.360
Did you?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.640
Like, no, that's not how you deal with that.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.960
Check this shit out though.

30:42.960 --> 30:48.000
Sex party's off and popping and it's going so good

30:48.000 --> 30:49.520
and lots of lovemaking going on.

30:49.520 --> 30:50.480
It's great.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.520
And then who walks in?

30:51.520 --> 30:53.120
It's fucking Anderson Cooper.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.040
And he's like, there's a mole.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.200
And then all of a sudden we get that fucking

30:58.080 --> 30:59.920
revival of the mole that we've all been waiting for.

30:59.920 --> 31:02.640
But it's like a very, very, very erotic mole.

31:04.320 --> 31:07.600
That would be the best television show that has ever aired.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.000
Are you kidding me with this ratings bonanza?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.960
I need you to stop with this bonanza you're having

31:12.960 --> 31:16.240
and take this quiz on who the mole is.

31:16.240 --> 31:16.960
Can we wait?

31:16.960 --> 31:19.040
I'm almost finished with my bonanza.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.480
Yes, you can wait.

31:20.480 --> 31:21.040
It's fine.

31:21.040 --> 31:22.880
I'm the designated watcher for this one.

31:22.880 --> 31:26.000
Anyway, so continue the bonanza.

31:26.880 --> 31:28.560
Please enjoy your bonanza.

31:28.560 --> 31:32.560
Just know that the love you make may be with the mole.

31:32.560 --> 31:33.760
Well, you've ruined it.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.040
I have no problem with that, Anderson.

31:37.040 --> 31:38.160
Oh, okay.

31:38.160 --> 31:38.720
Okay.

31:38.720 --> 31:39.760
I don't want to make love to the mole.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.920
I might have underestimated how much people cared

31:41.920 --> 31:43.520
about not having sex with the mole.

31:44.880 --> 31:47.920
I will say this, the mole is fucking smoking hot

31:47.920 --> 31:49.440
and really good at doing it.

31:49.440 --> 31:52.080
So you got that going for you.

31:52.080 --> 31:52.640
So you got that.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.480
Maybe you don't want to vote him off the island

31:54.480 --> 31:55.680
or however the mole works.

31:56.880 --> 31:57.760
It's been a long time.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.720
I just can't see a world where Ahmad Rashad

32:00.720 --> 32:02.640
doesn't try to sneak in there though.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.520
It seems like he would definitely want to be the guy.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.280
I don't think Anderson can handle this one on his own.

32:09.280 --> 32:13.440
I do need to just go ahead and help him on this one,

32:13.440 --> 32:14.160
on this Mitch.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.800
One of the two hosts is a mole,

32:16.800 --> 32:18.080
but we won't tell you which one.

32:19.760 --> 32:20.720
Man, I miss the mole.

32:20.720 --> 32:21.680
Fuck.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.280
Yeah, mole is a good show.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.120
It's a good television show.

32:25.120 --> 32:25.440
All right.

32:25.440 --> 32:26.560
Time to go to the money zone.

32:26.560 --> 32:27.040
Follow me.

32:27.040 --> 32:27.760
I'll show you the way.

32:40.160 --> 32:42.960
Gotta tell you about a box I got yesterday.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.800
Not yesterday, it was a few days ago.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.720
I opened it and my nose was full

32:46.720 --> 32:50.480
of the passionate smell of the beautiful blooms.

32:50.480 --> 32:53.040
A bunch of beautiful blooms because it's from ProFlowers.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.960
Because it's that time of year

32:54.960 --> 32:56.640
where ProFlowers sends us flowers

32:56.640 --> 32:58.000
and all of a sudden I have flowers in my house

32:58.000 --> 32:59.360
and at first I panic because I'm like,

32:59.360 --> 33:00.880
I don't know what to do with these things.

33:00.880 --> 33:04.000
But then I remember you just sort of look at them

33:04.000 --> 33:05.120
and smell them and they're great.

33:05.920 --> 33:06.400
Because they...

33:07.040 --> 33:08.320
What is it, Travis?

33:08.320 --> 33:09.360
Well, I was just going to say,

33:09.360 --> 33:13.120
like I can give you a 99% guarantee

33:13.120 --> 33:15.040
from my brother, my brother and me to you

33:15.040 --> 33:17.840
that these flowers will not contain a listening device.

33:18.640 --> 33:20.080
Oh no, no listening devices here.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.600
That's not how ProFlowers does it.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.280
If there's a listening device,

33:23.280 --> 33:25.520
it was planted there by, you know,

33:25.520 --> 33:28.880
I guess the whatever postal service delivered them.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.120
So they have really...

33:31.120 --> 33:32.880
These are great flowers, good prices.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.400
And right now you can get two dozen assorted roses

33:36.400 --> 33:39.840
with a free glass vase for 29.99 plus shipping and handling.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.120
That's what we've got.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.440
Beautiful vase with some beautiful roses.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.520
It really lightens up the kitchen.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.200
And can I tell you a secret, Griffin?

33:47.200 --> 33:48.000
Please.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.080
You can reuse that vase.

33:50.080 --> 33:53.440
Yeah, no, I realized we put it on the counter

33:53.440 --> 33:56.800
and I placed it in between two identical vases

33:56.800 --> 34:00.880
that we have full of some lovely, like gemstones.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.360
Don't break into my house though, please.

34:03.360 --> 34:04.720
They're not real gemstones.

34:04.720 --> 34:07.760
I don't just have a big urn full of rubies and emeralds.

34:08.560 --> 34:11.840
But right now the only way to get two dozen assorted roses

34:11.840 --> 34:14.640
with a free glass vase starting at 29.99.

34:14.640 --> 34:18.000
29, I just, I know I said 20 and then a bunch of nine sounds.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.920
It's 29.99.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.720
Just go to proflowers.com and use the code MYBROTHER.

34:22.720 --> 34:24.080
That's proflowers.com.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.480
Click on the microphone and type in the code MYBROTHER.

34:26.480 --> 34:27.200
Don't wait.

34:27.200 --> 34:28.720
This deal expires soon.

34:28.720 --> 34:30.160
No Valentine's Day is coming up

34:30.160 --> 34:32.800
and a lot of people are just looking for like a fun,

34:32.800 --> 34:34.000
special way to celebrate.

34:34.000 --> 34:34.640
Here it is.

34:34.640 --> 34:35.200
This is it.

34:35.840 --> 34:36.560
You found it.

34:36.560 --> 34:37.200
You found it.

34:38.640 --> 34:40.400
I would like to tell you about Casper.

34:41.040 --> 34:41.840
Yeah.

34:41.840 --> 34:45.760
It's a mattress company that's done changed the mattress game.

34:45.760 --> 34:48.000
I got two in my house.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.840
One that I sleep on in my bedroom

34:49.840 --> 34:52.560
and one that I sleep on in the nursery

34:52.560 --> 34:56.640
when my baby's being real fussy and I don't want to bother my wife.

34:57.440 --> 35:02.080
I put my baby in her crib and I sleep on the Casper mattress

35:02.080 --> 35:04.800
in the nursery and everybody sleeps okay.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.320
I'll say not great, but the quality of the sleep is good.

35:08.320 --> 35:11.360
It's the baby screaming that is the biggest effect of the sleep

35:11.360 --> 35:12.480
and not the mattress.

35:14.560 --> 35:18.160
That's a little insight onto the Travis McRoy sleep scape,

35:19.840 --> 35:22.960
but it has nothing to do with whether or not Casper is great

35:22.960 --> 35:23.600
because it is.

35:24.560 --> 35:25.840
Yeah, it's a fucking great.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.360
It's a great, great old mattress.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.400
We got one in the guest room and every time we have guests over

35:30.400 --> 35:32.880
they always talk about how sick it is.

35:33.760 --> 35:35.680
Have you talked about the free trial and return policy?

35:37.520 --> 35:39.360
You can sleep on a Casper for 100 days

35:39.360 --> 35:41.680
with free delivery to the US and Canada.

35:41.680 --> 35:45.280
And if you don't like it, that's not possible,

35:45.280 --> 35:47.840
but you get painless returns, so no big deal.

35:49.280 --> 35:52.000
$50 towards any mattress purchase can be yours

35:52.000 --> 35:53.840
by going to Casper.com slash my brother

35:53.840 --> 35:57.360
and using promo code my brother, all one word at checkout

35:57.360 --> 35:58.560
terms and conditions blog.

35:58.560 --> 36:00.400
Justin, can you tell me about this next message?

36:01.040 --> 36:06.720
Yes, this message is that the person who wrote the message

36:06.720 --> 36:09.920
wrote also wrote a book, so they're kind of multifaceted.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.280
Yeah, just writing a bunch of things,

36:11.280 --> 36:13.680
a bunch of different like vehicles.

36:14.720 --> 36:17.120
It's called systematic how systems biology

36:17.120 --> 36:19.360
is transforming modern medicine.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.440
And it explains how simple biological pieces

36:21.440 --> 36:23.440
work together to do complicated things.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.040
How the neurons in your brain work together

36:25.040 --> 36:26.800
to allow you to think how the microbes in your gut

36:26.800 --> 36:28.480
might influence your weight and mood,

36:28.480 --> 36:32.240
how bamboo flowering schedules create swarms of rats in India

36:32.240 --> 36:35.440
every 48 years and how gerbils in Kazakhstan

36:35.440 --> 36:36.720
get bubonic plague.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.480
Can you take another run at saying

36:38.480 --> 36:39.280
the name of that country?

36:39.840 --> 36:40.640
Kazakhstan?

36:41.280 --> 36:42.000
Kazakhstan?

36:42.720 --> 36:44.080
Well, I agree to disagree.

36:44.080 --> 36:46.160
No, don't do that, there's no disagreement

36:46.160 --> 36:47.120
to be found here, sir.

36:48.880 --> 36:51.360
Whichever one of you that is interrupting me so rudely,

36:51.360 --> 36:53.520
can I please just read the call to action?

36:53.520 --> 36:56.880
I mean, I guess so, but just the country has a way of saying it,

36:56.880 --> 36:58.160
but go for it, sorry.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.320
I think this is like a Mexico, Mexico kind of thing.

37:02.320 --> 37:03.280
Definitely not, but go ahead.

37:03.280 --> 37:06.080
Get a copy of Systematic at Amazon, Barnes & Noble,

37:06.080 --> 37:10.560
or your local bookstore starting February 7th, 2017,

37:11.840 --> 37:14.080
which is tomorrow.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.600
You can go get it.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.760
You should say what they said in their message, though,

37:17.760 --> 37:19.440
because they kind of, they kind of-

37:19.440 --> 37:20.960
They did throw a little shade, they said,

37:20.960 --> 37:23.360
which was definitely 11 months ago, but it wasn't.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.840
It's tomorrow, you fucking asshole.

37:25.840 --> 37:26.340
Nailed it.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.400
Thanks for the money.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.360
Thanks for the money.

37:31.360 --> 37:31.920
Good job on the book.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.160
Good job on the book.

37:34.160 --> 37:35.440
Now you can write a third thing.

37:35.440 --> 37:36.960
It's an apology note.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.560
Looking forward to it.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.240
I have a message here for Melanie,

37:41.200 --> 37:43.600
and it's from your little sister who says,

37:43.600 --> 37:44.640
happy birthday, Melanie.

37:44.640 --> 37:45.840
I love you so much.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.320
And to express just how much you mean to me,

37:48.320 --> 37:51.120
I chose the sweetest baby brother in the whole world

37:51.120 --> 37:53.760
to tell you so on your favorite podcast.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.000
You're my best friend and amazing older sister,

37:56.000 --> 37:57.760
and I love you tremendously.

37:57.760 --> 37:58.560
Here's to you.

37:59.760 --> 38:00.320
This one is also-

38:00.320 --> 38:02.320
I miss you, miss you tremendously.

38:02.320 --> 38:03.120
Oh, what did I say?

38:03.680 --> 38:04.480
Kazakhstan.

38:08.240 --> 38:09.520
I miss you tremendously.

38:09.520 --> 38:10.160
Here's to you.

38:12.080 --> 38:13.760
And this was supposed to go up in February,

38:13.760 --> 38:14.400
so we're-

38:14.400 --> 38:17.280
Guys, I'm feeling good about how we're starting this year off

38:17.280 --> 38:20.880
with regards to Jumbotrons and literally in no other regard.

38:21.520 --> 38:24.560
Literally no other way am I cool with how we're doing so far,

38:24.560 --> 38:26.480
except for this one way, we're doing it pretty good.

38:26.480 --> 38:32.160
The first ever Very Very Fun Day is coming to Talley Hall in Chicago on February 11th

38:32.160 --> 38:35.520
with media sponsorship from WBEZ 91.5.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.120
Advanced tickets are sold out,

38:37.120 --> 38:40.320
but we will have a limited number of tickets for sale at the door.

38:40.320 --> 38:44.160
So come on out for a day jam-packed with five great MaxFun podcasts,

38:44.160 --> 38:46.480
four local shows, and a comic showcase.

38:46.480 --> 39:01.280
For more information, please visit MaximumFun.org slash Very Very Fun Day.

39:11.280 --> 39:13.840
Another question here from a listener, and it goes a little something-

39:13.840 --> 39:14.800
Oh no, we're going to do a yahoo.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.800
Oh no, we're going to do a yahoo, shush.

39:18.240 --> 39:18.880
You're the boss.

39:20.240 --> 39:23.120
Media Luminary swinging his 30 under 30 around.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.880
How about this one from Morgan Davey?

39:24.880 --> 39:26.320
Keep it waving, Morgan Davey.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.560
It's from Yahoo Answers user Lisa R who says,

39:29.600 --> 39:36.080
what is a good argument to convince my parents to let me have a two horses?

39:37.120 --> 39:38.000
Hello, hello.

39:39.280 --> 39:39.920
Hi.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.840
I've been dreading the conversation,

39:41.840 --> 39:44.480
convincing my parents to allow me to get another horse.

39:44.480 --> 39:48.240
Right now I have a horse that I was going to use for barrel racing,

39:49.040 --> 39:53.760
which I'll interject here is when you stuff a horse into a barrel

39:53.760 --> 39:55.600
and then you stand on top of the barrel

39:55.600 --> 39:57.520
and you just kind of run with it all wacky.

39:58.720 --> 40:01.920
But turned out to be better at Western Pleasure,

40:01.920 --> 40:03.280
and that's where, I don't know, man.

40:05.680 --> 40:07.120
I'm going to need one of y'all to Google.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.120
I know that means you're not going to pay attention to the rest of the question,

40:09.120 --> 40:10.800
but I must know what Western Pleasure is.

40:10.800 --> 40:13.280
Travis, no, just one of you.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.120
I need one of you to listen to the rest of the question.

40:15.920 --> 40:18.720
It is a Western style competition at horse shows

40:18.720 --> 40:21.200
that evaluates horses on manners and suitability of the horse.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.200
Couldn't have found a better name.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.600
Yeah, Western Pleasure.

40:25.600 --> 40:26.480
Fucking sick.

40:26.480 --> 40:29.120
We're going to get into horse manners here in a second.

40:29.120 --> 40:30.560
Why couldn't we just fucking,

40:30.560 --> 40:32.000
I'm going to start a new podcast

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
and I have zero time for new projects right now.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.400
I swore to myself no new projects,

40:36.400 --> 40:39.520
but now I must have a podcast called Western Pleasure

40:39.520 --> 40:43.520
and it's a fan cast for Northern Exposure.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.160
Okay, right now I have a horse that I was going to use for barrel racing,

40:48.160 --> 40:50.000
but turned out to be better at Western Pleasure

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
and I have gotten very attached to this horse.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.640
Anyway, so now I'd like to add a new-

40:54.640 --> 40:57.040
That's just a bad sentence construction.

40:57.040 --> 41:00.400
So good at Western Pleasure, I have grown very attached to this horse.

41:00.400 --> 41:03.920
Anyway, so now I'd like to add a new speed horse

41:03.920 --> 41:07.200
and do not know how to come about this conversation with my parents.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.360
I feel like their main argument point will be

41:09.360 --> 41:10.880
why do you need two horses?

41:10.880 --> 41:11.600
Please help me.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.800
So we've done, gosh, how many questions about horses?

41:14.800 --> 41:15.680
All of them?

41:15.680 --> 41:16.240
Secretly?

41:16.240 --> 41:18.160
There's an undercurrent of horse in everything

41:18.160 --> 41:21.600
and we've talked about convincing the parents to let me get a horse.

41:21.600 --> 41:24.320
This is a new and exciting avenue for us,

41:24.320 --> 41:26.720
which is what if there's another one?

41:28.240 --> 41:30.000
Just a super quick sidebar.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.680
I did search Western Pleasure in iTunes

41:33.680 --> 41:37.040
and while it returned no podcast, it did return a book.

41:37.040 --> 41:37.600
Oh, good.

41:37.600 --> 41:42.000
Handsome Ty Steele, a professional horse trainer is looking to add to his income

41:42.000 --> 41:44.960
by offering horseback riding lessons at his horse farm.

41:44.960 --> 41:47.600
Unfortunately, he accidentally places his ad

41:47.600 --> 41:50.160
in the personal section of the local newspaper.

41:50.160 --> 41:54.000
Gordon Burghardt, recently transferred from New York to the Midwest,

41:54.000 --> 41:55.120
comes across the ad.

41:55.120 --> 41:58.080
His overactive libido causes him to misinterpret the ad

41:58.080 --> 42:01.120
as offering something far different than what Ty intended.

42:01.120 --> 42:01.680
Fucking yes.

42:01.680 --> 42:05.760
So what happens when Gordon arrives at the farm for his lesson?

42:05.760 --> 42:09.280
And that is the book by Terry O'Reilly called Western Pleasure

42:09.280 --> 42:11.440
and you can get it for $1.99.

42:11.440 --> 42:13.840
Tear my fucking pants off, Western Pleasure.

42:13.840 --> 42:14.400
Hell yeah.

42:14.960 --> 42:18.000
What's a good argument to convince my parents to let me have two horses, though?

42:20.160 --> 42:21.520
I mean, here's the thing.

42:21.520 --> 42:21.840
You said-

42:21.840 --> 42:23.440
I came up with the best argument.

42:23.440 --> 42:24.160
Oh, okay.

42:24.720 --> 42:27.120
Did you just interrupt me or is the fucking-

42:27.120 --> 42:27.920
I just interrupted.

42:27.920 --> 42:28.880
No, I just interrupted you.

42:31.600 --> 42:34.080
But I came up with a really good joke and I didn't want to wait.

42:34.080 --> 42:37.280
Well, that's in the Travis McElroy story.

42:37.280 --> 42:38.320
Holy shit.

42:38.320 --> 42:40.640
Shit, you beat me to it.

42:40.640 --> 42:41.680
Fucking go for it then.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.320
Best argument for two horses.

42:44.320 --> 42:45.280
I have four legs.

42:47.600 --> 42:48.640
Yeah, I mean, that's a good-

42:48.640 --> 42:49.280
Damn it, you're right.

42:49.280 --> 42:49.920
All right, worth it.

42:49.920 --> 42:50.960
But the legs would have to be-

42:50.960 --> 42:51.440
Sorry, Travis.

42:51.440 --> 42:52.960
The legs would have to be arranged-

42:52.960 --> 42:54.080
I am a centaur.

42:54.080 --> 42:54.960
No, no, no, no, no.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.160
See, dummy.

42:56.160 --> 42:57.600
It can't be like that.

42:57.600 --> 42:58.000
It has to be-

42:58.000 --> 42:59.120
You broke your joke.

42:59.120 --> 43:03.840
It has to be four horizontally aligned, a perpendicular-

43:03.840 --> 43:04.800
I'm a comb.

43:04.800 --> 43:05.360
Of legs.

43:05.360 --> 43:07.120
You have to be a comb, right.

43:07.120 --> 43:08.960
I'm a human centipede just getting started.

43:11.680 --> 43:17.360
Okay, the best argument, and I'm being serious here because I want to seriously fucking help

43:17.360 --> 43:23.360
this person because that used to mean something around here, is you said parents, plural S.

43:23.360 --> 43:28.640
You got two parents, two horses, romantic rides, romantic horse dates for the folks.

43:28.640 --> 43:30.400
I'll use this motherfucker for Western pleasure.

43:30.400 --> 43:32.480
I'll use this other motherfucker for speed racing.

43:32.480 --> 43:35.440
And then on the weekends, you take them out to the ranch.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.400
You're having a good time out there, romantic time.

43:38.400 --> 43:40.080
Maybe you start feeling things that you haven't felt.

43:40.080 --> 43:41.280
Things got a little bit stale.

43:42.640 --> 43:44.320
Going out on horseback is going to change all that.

43:45.280 --> 43:50.960
The problem is convincing your parents that two horses is not a case of diminishing returns

43:51.600 --> 43:56.640
because you have to feed two separate horses now.

43:56.640 --> 43:59.760
You have to stable two separate horses now.

43:59.760 --> 44:01.920
And you can't ride both of them.

44:01.920 --> 44:04.880
You, singular, cannot ride both of them at the same time.

44:05.600 --> 44:10.880
So how do you convince your parents that it is an increase, it is a return on investment?

44:11.520 --> 44:16.240
And I think the answer is you have to convince them the horse is magical.

44:16.240 --> 44:17.600
Oh, okay.

44:18.720 --> 44:24.720
Not that you need another horse, general, but you need this specific horse.

44:24.720 --> 44:26.240
See, this horse is fire type.

44:26.240 --> 44:28.000
The one I got now, fire type.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.160
And so when a water type comes around, I'm fucked.

44:30.160 --> 44:32.240
So I need to get me a grass type horse.

44:33.600 --> 44:35.600
Just kidding, all horses are grass type.

44:35.600 --> 44:37.280
It's all they eat is silly geese.

44:38.560 --> 44:40.000
Here's what you got to do.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.560
I got a solution for you on this one.

44:42.560 --> 44:44.000
This one I got a solution for.

44:44.720 --> 44:48.000
What you're going to do is you're going to buy two horses before your parents find out.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.040
Oh, I see.

44:49.040 --> 44:54.160
Once they are both there, you marry them.

44:54.160 --> 45:00.320
And then your parents are like, you've got to sell one of these bad boys.

45:00.320 --> 45:03.840
And you say, well, mom, dad, they're married.

45:03.840 --> 45:10.080
So no, I don't think that I'm going to sell one because they're a married pair of horses.

45:10.080 --> 45:11.440
They're a married couple.

45:11.440 --> 45:15.680
I do like, Justin, in the scenario that you have assumed that the person asking this question

45:16.320 --> 45:20.560
is someone who has the means to purchase two horses.

45:20.560 --> 45:23.520
They're just afraid of the condemnation from their parents.

45:23.520 --> 45:25.520
I thought you were going to say the means to marry a horse,

45:25.520 --> 45:28.560
at which point I was going to just jump through the internet, Travis,

45:28.560 --> 45:31.360
and tell you everybody can marry a horse.

45:31.360 --> 45:32.880
It's all make believe.

45:32.880 --> 45:36.320
And we're all just having make believe fun when we talk about these things.

45:36.320 --> 45:38.080
I could go out and marry two horses right now.

45:38.080 --> 45:40.080
I could marry two dogs if I wanted to.

45:40.080 --> 45:41.040
I guess that's true.

45:41.760 --> 45:42.800
Technically speaking, he's got a point.

45:42.800 --> 45:44.720
I couldn't come up with any argument.

45:44.720 --> 45:48.080
Yeah, there's no argument against, yeah, absolutely.

45:48.080 --> 45:49.520
So I think if you marry the horses,

45:49.520 --> 45:52.160
then legally your parents can't make you sell either one of them.

45:52.160 --> 45:54.960
Yeah, marry them to each other or you marry them.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.120
No, you marry them to each other, Travis.

45:57.120 --> 45:58.000
Okay, I just-

45:58.000 --> 46:01.440
Justin, just wanted to make sure we all understood what page we were on.

46:02.640 --> 46:04.480
You were on a bad page.

46:04.480 --> 46:05.280
No, no, no.

46:05.280 --> 46:09.600
I just wanted to make sure everyone knew what page we all three were on.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.640
Choose your own adventure novel and you got ate by a yeti, sir.

46:14.160 --> 46:15.600
And then I married the yeti.

46:15.600 --> 46:16.800
You married the yeti.

46:16.800 --> 46:19.200
You loved the yeti very, very much.

46:19.200 --> 46:20.320
I'm going to ask another question.

46:20.320 --> 46:22.800
The other day in my intro to criminal justice class,

46:22.800 --> 46:26.240
a student took out a whole lemon and started to peel it.

46:26.240 --> 46:28.000
And then he asked me for the time.

46:28.560 --> 46:32.400
So I told him and he went, oh, okay, in a sad tone of voice

46:32.400 --> 46:34.720
and put his partially peeled lemon back into his-

46:34.720 --> 46:45.680
He put his partially peeled lemon back into his back,

46:45.680 --> 46:47.600
almost ashamed of his actions.

46:47.600 --> 47:03.200
My question is this, what should I do if the situation comes up again?

47:03.200 --> 47:07.680
What is the code word that I can use so I can get this man to enjoy his lemon in class?

47:08.480 --> 47:11.920
I think he's some kind of citrus sleeper agent and I need advice.

47:11.920 --> 47:15.120
That's confused and citrusy in the concord.

47:15.120 --> 47:23.760
We have been getting, listen, before we talk about this,

47:23.760 --> 47:28.080
I just want to say we've been getting some fucking all time questions from you all.

47:28.080 --> 47:32.000
The past few weeks have been all time questions

47:32.000 --> 47:35.280
and I can't thank you enough for making this show palatable.

47:36.480 --> 47:37.520
There's so many.

47:37.520 --> 47:38.400
There's so many.

47:38.400 --> 47:41.760
I love our listeners and I believe, listen, I believe you.

47:41.760 --> 47:43.280
If you come to us with a question,

47:43.280 --> 47:45.440
that is a sacred bond of trust you put forward.

47:45.440 --> 47:47.520
I believe you, except I don't believe this person

47:47.520 --> 47:54.480
because there's so many angles to this dangle that is just unimaginable.

47:54.480 --> 47:56.800
The fact that this person was apparently going to eat a lemon

47:56.800 --> 47:58.800
is like not even chief among them,

47:58.800 --> 48:02.720
but that they unpeeled, they unspooled this lemon a little bit,

48:02.720 --> 48:05.360
found out that the time was bad or wrong,

48:05.360 --> 48:08.160
and then put the partially unpeeled lemon,

48:08.160 --> 48:12.240
just going to let some of the raw flesh of the fruit touch the inside of my JanSport.

48:12.240 --> 48:13.520
What?

48:13.520 --> 48:16.080
This kind of thing always makes me feel I'm an old man now.

48:16.080 --> 48:16.800
I'm 33.

48:16.800 --> 48:18.560
I'm not as hip as I used to be.

48:18.560 --> 48:22.960
This always makes me fear that this is a reference or a meme

48:22.960 --> 48:26.640
or some kind of internet joke that was like a setup

48:26.640 --> 48:29.360
that you were supposed to respond a certain way.

48:29.360 --> 48:30.560
Like, what's the fox say?

48:30.560 --> 48:31.840
And you're like, this is math class.

48:31.840 --> 48:32.480
What are you talking about?

48:32.480 --> 48:33.600
What are you talking about?

48:33.600 --> 48:34.160
Okay.

48:34.160 --> 48:37.520
This was a gag from last night's American dad.

48:37.520 --> 48:42.240
Well, he didn't fucking see that, of course.

48:42.240 --> 48:42.800
Oh, I've got it.

48:42.800 --> 48:46.880
So you're saying that after they asked for what time,

48:46.880 --> 48:49.520
you should have looked them in the eyes and said, what's up?

48:49.520 --> 48:50.560
Yeah, exactly.

48:50.560 --> 48:51.120
Exactly.

48:51.120 --> 48:52.080
That's exactly it.

48:52.080 --> 48:54.720
Here's what I think the proper response is in this situation.

48:54.720 --> 48:56.240
They start peeling the lemon.

48:56.240 --> 48:58.400
They say, excuse me, do you have the time?

48:58.400 --> 49:02.560
You do a dramatic take, make eye contact with him and whisper,

49:02.560 --> 49:04.160
it's the sour hour.

49:04.160 --> 49:09.680
And then just everything goes crazy.

49:09.680 --> 49:13.200
I mean, I think you could even be more on the nose than that

49:13.200 --> 49:14.960
and just say, it's time for me to watch you

49:14.960 --> 49:20.800
apparently eat a lemon like one might eat a delicious tangelo.

49:20.800 --> 49:22.480
And I'm very much looking forward to it.

49:22.480 --> 49:25.280
So please don't cock block me again.

49:25.280 --> 49:27.040
I got to watch this pop off, please.

49:27.040 --> 49:28.800
I've been thinking about it all week

49:28.800 --> 49:30.240
since you bailed on me last week.

49:30.240 --> 49:31.440
You left me devastated.

49:31.440 --> 49:35.520
I do enjoy the image of a person who attends their class

49:35.520 --> 49:37.520
with a lemon and not a phone.

49:37.520 --> 49:41.360
So they have the one thing, they do have a lemon with them.

49:41.360 --> 49:44.080
They left the house today with a lemon and not a phone.

49:44.080 --> 49:44.560
Yeah.

49:44.560 --> 49:47.840
Doesn't this reminds me of like those logic puzzles

49:47.840 --> 49:51.360
where it's like two men meet at a restaurant

49:51.360 --> 49:54.480
and order albatross and say for old time's sake,

49:54.480 --> 49:57.680
and when they take a bite, they fling themselves off a brick.

49:57.680 --> 50:00.640
Like this is like, there's some explanation here

50:00.640 --> 50:02.480
that I just don't understand.

50:02.480 --> 50:04.800
And it's like, well, you have to know

50:04.800 --> 50:07.920
that lemon is also another word for,

50:07.920 --> 50:09.680
and it's like, ah, it all makes sense now.

50:09.680 --> 50:14.560
Is there possibly maybe like a university-wide protest,

50:14.560 --> 50:17.200
a very subtle protest where like-

50:17.200 --> 50:19.920
All right, at noon, we're all gonna eat our lemons.

50:19.920 --> 50:22.640
Right, we'll all eat a lemon at the same time.

50:22.640 --> 50:24.240
I mean, maybe you're onto it.

50:24.240 --> 50:25.440
Maybe it's just this person feels

50:25.440 --> 50:27.280
like being very disruptive today.

50:27.280 --> 50:29.600
So they take a big juicy bite of their lemon

50:29.600 --> 50:32.800
while the professor's talking about criminal justice.

50:32.800 --> 50:34.960
And he's like, well, it's really important to understand

50:34.960 --> 50:35.920
about jurisprudence.

50:35.920 --> 50:37.840
And then this person's just like, chomp.

50:37.840 --> 50:40.720
Oh, can you please, do you mind not doing that

50:40.720 --> 50:41.680
in the middle of my class?

50:41.680 --> 50:43.600
Hey, we're allowed to eat.

50:43.600 --> 50:44.960
I looked it up in the bylaws.

50:44.960 --> 50:45.200
Homp.

50:48.160 --> 50:49.280
Cankersores.

50:49.280 --> 50:52.080
Oh, the cankersores are barking.

50:53.840 --> 50:55.680
Is it maybe a flash mob?

50:56.320 --> 50:58.080
Is there maybe a flash mob happening

50:58.080 --> 51:00.080
and this person's one role in the flash mob

51:00.080 --> 51:02.000
is to eat a lemon at his exact moment.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.080
There's like some improv everywhere shit.

51:04.080 --> 51:04.560
I don't know exactly what-

51:04.560 --> 51:05.760
Oh, but they missed it.

51:05.760 --> 51:07.360
They missed it, that's it.

51:07.360 --> 51:09.600
Yeah, that's what they, yeah.

51:09.600 --> 51:10.800
It's not that they're too early.

51:10.800 --> 51:11.840
It's that they're too late.

51:11.840 --> 51:16.480
And the whole fucking mousetrap style,

51:16.480 --> 51:20.320
like what's the word for like the Rube Goldberg machine-

51:20.320 --> 51:22.160
Oh, they were supposed to start it.

51:22.160 --> 51:22.960
Yeah, exactly.

51:22.960 --> 51:24.880
Them eating a lemon was just to start it.

51:24.880 --> 51:27.760
So there's just a flash mob like waiting at 12.01,

51:27.760 --> 51:30.640
like, oh, come on, Jerry, come on.

51:30.640 --> 51:32.800
And then Jerry shows up to class at 1.01

51:32.800 --> 51:35.520
because they forgot about daylight savings time.

51:35.520 --> 51:36.560
And it's like, what time is it?

51:36.560 --> 51:37.520
And you're like, it's 1.01.

51:37.520 --> 51:41.200
You're like, oh, oh no, the mob's gonna be so mad at me.

51:41.200 --> 51:43.120
They plan on doing a flash mob to Led Zeppelin's

51:43.120 --> 51:44.000
The Lemon Song.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.720
And then they're like, ah, fuck, I even brought the prop.

51:46.720 --> 51:47.680
Guess I gotta eat it now.

51:50.480 --> 51:51.440
This is amazing.

51:51.440 --> 51:52.560
I can't imagine.

51:52.560 --> 51:53.520
So good.

51:53.520 --> 51:57.680
Is there another good question that you want to do?

51:57.680 --> 52:01.360
My office puts a 1,000-piece puzzle in the break room

52:01.360 --> 52:02.640
for everyone to work on.

52:02.640 --> 52:04.720
When finished, a picture of the puzzle

52:04.720 --> 52:08.000
is taken, displayed, and a new puzzle is put out.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.600
Although people work on the puzzles,

52:09.600 --> 52:11.360
I'm always the one who completes them.

52:11.360 --> 52:12.080
Am I good?

52:12.080 --> 52:14.400
Or should I let someone else know the sweet satisfaction

52:14.400 --> 52:16.560
of putting in that final piece?

52:16.560 --> 52:18.320
And that's from Puzzlet in Cleveland, Ohio.

52:20.960 --> 52:21.920
This is a good question.

52:21.920 --> 52:24.560
But also, I want to address the fact that you work at an office.

52:25.280 --> 52:26.560
We're hanging on the walls.

52:26.560 --> 52:28.800
A guest might come into your office to do business

52:28.800 --> 52:31.680
and see a fucking framed picture of just, like,

52:31.680 --> 52:32.960
a bunch of balloons.

52:35.280 --> 52:36.320
That's pretty cool.

52:36.320 --> 52:39.040
You guys are really into balloons and, what is that, ice cream?

52:39.600 --> 52:42.080
And that's the album cover of Sgt.

52:42.080 --> 52:43.440
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

52:43.440 --> 52:46.320
Boy, you guys are into a lot of diverse topics, I see.

52:46.880 --> 52:51.040
I love this super cool Pixar slash Google workspace

52:51.040 --> 52:53.760
where the bosses are like, no, we don't care if you spend hours

52:53.760 --> 52:55.920
on end in the break room working on a puzzle.

52:55.920 --> 52:56.960
Whatever.

52:56.960 --> 52:58.000
We're cool here.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.640
It's a puzzle QA facility.

53:00.640 --> 53:03.520
So it is part of their, here's what I would do.

53:03.520 --> 53:04.480
Fucking mix it up.

53:04.480 --> 53:05.360
Are you ready for this?

53:06.240 --> 53:08.960
When you're about to put in the final piece of the puzzle,

53:09.920 --> 53:11.200
put something underneath the puzzle,

53:12.080 --> 53:13.520
flip it over upside down,

53:14.480 --> 53:16.480
wait for someone to enter the room,

53:17.120 --> 53:19.360
and then put the last piece in.

53:19.360 --> 53:19.760
Oh, fucking shit.

53:19.760 --> 53:21.600
And they'll look at you and you'll just be like,

53:22.160 --> 53:23.280
that's how I do it.

53:23.280 --> 53:25.440
Fucking Bobby Budnick from Slate Your Short Style.

53:26.080 --> 53:27.520
I put the puzzle in,

53:28.240 --> 53:29.840
I could put it together backwards.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.040
I feel like the picture is cheating.

53:31.040 --> 53:31.520
That is so sick.

53:31.520 --> 53:34.880
And you'll become a fucking office legend.

53:34.880 --> 53:37.200
I have another way of doing it good.

53:37.200 --> 53:40.240
And that is just when you're about to crush it,

53:40.240 --> 53:41.040
you call everybody in.

53:41.040 --> 53:41.600
Guys, come in here.

53:41.600 --> 53:42.560
I'm about to crush this puzzle.

53:43.280 --> 53:45.120
Folks, come in to watch you smash the puzzle.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.080
And you get that last piece and you're like, here it goes.

53:48.080 --> 53:49.520
And you hold it way up in the air,

53:49.520 --> 53:50.480
like you're going to slam dunk it.

53:50.480 --> 53:52.320
Like, oh, and you're bringing your arm down

53:52.320 --> 53:53.680
and everybody's like cheering and clapping

53:53.680 --> 53:55.520
because they're about to be set free from the puzzle.

53:55.520 --> 53:56.800
And then you spring your arm down,

53:56.800 --> 53:58.400
but then your arm hooks and crooks

53:58.400 --> 54:00.080
and you put it in your mouth and you eat it.

54:00.080 --> 54:04.000
And then everybody's like, whoa, yo, James, what the fuck?

54:04.000 --> 54:04.640
And then you say,

54:06.160 --> 54:08.240
there's a final piece of the puzzle is you.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.480
Teamwork is the final piece of the puzzle.

54:12.480 --> 54:13.520
And everybody claps.

54:13.520 --> 54:14.160
Now you're the boss.

54:14.160 --> 54:15.840
You've inspired everybody.

54:15.840 --> 54:18.320
And they take a picture of this puzzle without a piece.

54:18.320 --> 54:19.840
And all of a sudden it's like an office episode

54:19.840 --> 54:22.560
because it didn't go right, but they learned something.

54:23.120 --> 54:25.360
Why wouldn't they just frame the puzzle?

54:25.360 --> 54:26.720
Why do they take a picture?

54:26.720 --> 54:28.640
Is that for like, so we could do it again later?

54:29.200 --> 54:30.560
Do they have that few puzzles?

54:31.120 --> 54:32.400
Yeah, we got to keep this.

54:32.400 --> 54:35.280
This is a fucking Prima strategy guide on balloon puzzle.

54:37.200 --> 54:37.840
What if we get a-

54:37.840 --> 54:39.680
Picture as a reference for the next time,

54:39.680 --> 54:41.440
like it looks like this when it's done.

54:42.480 --> 54:43.280
That'd be sick.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.640
If I fucking worked at an office

54:44.640 --> 54:47.040
and they had me put together a thousand piece balloon puzzle

54:47.040 --> 54:48.400
and it took me a month

54:48.400 --> 54:49.840
and then all of a sudden they brought in

54:49.840 --> 54:50.560
and they're like, guess what?

54:50.560 --> 54:51.440
Same balloon puzzle.

54:51.440 --> 54:52.240
I'd be like, fuck yeah.

54:52.240 --> 54:53.440
All right, guys, let's get it together.

54:53.440 --> 54:56.320
We know the green one's there at the bottom left

54:56.320 --> 54:57.440
and let's just work from there.

54:58.480 --> 54:59.440
I can't imagine.

55:00.320 --> 55:01.120
I can't imagine.

55:01.120 --> 55:03.520
I think being the person to finish the puzzle, I get it.

55:03.520 --> 55:03.760
Yeah.

55:03.760 --> 55:06.000
Can you imagine being the person to start the puzzle?

55:06.000 --> 55:07.600
What would be worse than that?

55:07.600 --> 55:10.480
Like if I see a pile of puzzle pieces,

55:10.480 --> 55:11.680
I'm just going to keep on walking.

55:11.680 --> 55:13.200
There's no words on heaven or earth.

55:13.200 --> 55:14.960
That's going to make me start the sorting process.

55:14.960 --> 55:16.560
Unless you find those tasty corners.

55:16.560 --> 55:17.360
You find those corners

55:17.360 --> 55:19.920
and then all of a sudden you're like, my work here is done.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.320
Everything you do will be built on the back

55:22.320 --> 55:24.080
of my major accomplishment here.

55:24.800 --> 55:27.280
I am now, now I'm the puzzle master.

55:27.280 --> 55:29.600
You know, that's what you,

55:29.600 --> 55:30.960
when you get to that last piece,

55:30.960 --> 55:32.000
you take that last piece,

55:32.000 --> 55:33.120
you go out in the office

55:33.120 --> 55:36.160
and you find the person who's been having a rough time.

55:36.160 --> 55:38.160
Maybe like they just lost the big account

55:38.160 --> 55:39.120
and you walk up to them

55:39.120 --> 55:40.560
and you like kind of flip it to them.

55:40.560 --> 55:42.000
Like you're flipping them a quarter

55:42.000 --> 55:43.920
and you're like, you need this more than I do.

55:43.920 --> 55:47.120
And like they get to switch the puzzle.

55:47.120 --> 55:48.480
They can switch the puzzle.

55:48.480 --> 55:50.000
One thing that you could do

55:50.000 --> 55:52.880
is take early on in the process,

55:52.880 --> 55:54.080
steal one piece of the puzzle

55:54.720 --> 55:59.680
and then put it in a giant sack of foam waffles

55:59.680 --> 56:02.720
and make them like slip around and look for it.

56:02.720 --> 56:07.120
That's how Mark Summers invented Double Dare at his office

56:07.120 --> 56:08.160
and he got fired for that,

56:08.160 --> 56:09.520
but then he got a job at Double Dare.

56:09.520 --> 56:10.400
So it all worked out.

56:10.400 --> 56:11.520
It all worked out in the end.

56:11.520 --> 56:15.200
And another thing you could do is buy,

56:15.200 --> 56:20.160
go to Spencer's Gifts and bring like a hundred dollars

56:20.160 --> 56:21.360
because you're going to want to purchase

56:21.360 --> 56:22.720
a lot of fun stuff in there.

56:22.720 --> 56:24.720
But you buy a sexy erotic Puz,

56:26.160 --> 56:28.240
just like a good doing it Puz

56:28.240 --> 56:29.680
and then everybody's putting together

56:29.680 --> 56:31.360
this balloon Puz at work

56:31.360 --> 56:33.040
and then you go in to finish it.

56:33.040 --> 56:34.080
You shut and lock the doors.

56:34.080 --> 56:35.440
You throw that balloon Puz away

56:35.440 --> 56:37.520
and you put down this finished sex Puz.

56:37.520 --> 56:38.560
And then when people come in,

56:38.560 --> 56:39.360
you'd be like, yeah,

56:39.360 --> 56:41.440
I guess we just couldn't see it until it was finished.

56:41.440 --> 56:43.600
But damn, Jerry,

56:43.600 --> 56:45.920
you picked up a pretty fucking erotic Puz, bud.

56:47.680 --> 56:49.040
A lot of hunks in this Puz.

56:49.040 --> 56:50.080
A lot of hunks.

56:50.080 --> 56:52.080
There's a hunky Puz.

56:52.080 --> 56:55.280
A lot of fucking trouser dogs in this one, huh, bud?

56:56.000 --> 56:59.600
Hey, hey, Jerry, this Puz was called Western Pleasure.

56:59.600 --> 57:00.960
That's what you got wild, man.

57:00.960 --> 57:02.160
I'm trying to fucking figure that out.

57:02.160 --> 57:03.120
I mean, it's fucking good.

57:03.120 --> 57:06.400
It's tasteful and like very like sexy, but like.

57:06.400 --> 57:08.240
I also thought it was going to be balloons.

57:08.240 --> 57:09.760
I'm as surprised as anyone here.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.600
Right, I thought balloons until the moment

57:11.600 --> 57:12.560
I put the dick one in.

57:12.560 --> 57:14.960
And this one piece did have the dick in it.

57:14.960 --> 57:16.400
Then you fucking reach down,

57:16.400 --> 57:17.600
you pop a piece out,

57:17.600 --> 57:19.600
and you shift the rest of the Puz a little bit.

57:19.600 --> 57:22.720
It's fucking one of those lintricular ventricular dealies.

57:22.720 --> 57:24.240
And all of a sudden it turns into balloons

57:24.240 --> 57:26.080
as soon as you pop that one piece out.

57:26.080 --> 57:27.840
What is this sorcery?

57:27.840 --> 57:29.600
That's another thing you could also do.

57:29.600 --> 57:31.280
Folks, that's going to do it for us this week.

57:31.280 --> 57:32.240
I'm my brother, my brother and me.

57:32.240 --> 57:33.680
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

57:33.680 --> 57:35.920
We last week put out the trailer for our TV show.

57:35.920 --> 57:36.800
If you want to watch that,

57:37.440 --> 57:39.040
you can check out CISO's Facebook page

57:39.040 --> 57:42.160
or CISO's YouTube channel or just find,

57:42.160 --> 57:43.440
I mean, it's not hard to find media.

57:43.440 --> 57:45.520
It's 2017, just like find it.

57:45.520 --> 57:47.120
Find it on YouTube and wherever.

57:47.120 --> 57:47.840
Go watch it.

57:47.840 --> 57:49.200
A lot of people liked it.

57:49.200 --> 57:50.240
That was very gratifying.

57:51.680 --> 57:54.240
Yeah, I'm very excited for,

57:54.240 --> 57:55.760
we're going to like more and more stuff.

57:55.760 --> 57:56.720
So it's going to keep coming out

57:56.720 --> 57:58.960
until the show comes out on the 23rd.

57:58.960 --> 58:01.840
I am, holy shit guys, that's very soon, huh?

58:01.840 --> 58:03.040
Two weeks.

58:03.040 --> 58:03.600
Two weeks.

58:04.320 --> 58:05.120
Holy shit.

58:05.120 --> 58:07.760
All right, well, I think everybody's going to dig it.

58:07.760 --> 58:10.000
So if you don't, please don't tell us

58:10.000 --> 58:11.920
because the podcast can be bad.

58:11.920 --> 58:14.720
Like we've made like 4,000 of these, whatever,

58:14.720 --> 58:16.400
but we only made six of the TV show.

58:16.960 --> 58:18.160
And so if you think it's bad,

58:18.160 --> 58:19.920
it would hurt my feelings very much.

58:19.920 --> 58:21.920
Yeah, it would hurt feelings.

58:23.200 --> 58:26.240
And we've heard from a lot of people,

58:26.240 --> 58:27.840
I just want to clarify this on the show.

58:27.840 --> 58:28.880
We've heard from a lot of people

58:28.880 --> 58:30.160
who do not live in America

58:30.160 --> 58:34.320
and as such have difficulty accessing CISO.

58:34.320 --> 58:35.440
I'm sorry for that.

58:35.440 --> 58:38.240
Very, very sorry for that, that situation exists.

58:38.960 --> 58:41.200
We also have like no,

58:41.200 --> 58:43.360
there's no reality in which we have any control

58:43.360 --> 58:44.240
over that whatsoever.

58:45.200 --> 58:46.960
And the CISO people are smart people.

58:46.960 --> 58:48.400
I mean, if they could just flip a switch,

58:48.400 --> 58:49.600
I'm sure the switch would be flipped.

58:49.600 --> 58:51.920
It is not because they hate Canada

58:51.920 --> 58:58.560
and there's like bonkers licensing stuff involved.

58:58.560 --> 58:59.120
I mean, I'm talking about-

58:59.120 --> 59:02.080
Which we also have no, yeah, we have no idea.

59:02.080 --> 59:04.880
But ask them, that's the best thing you can do.

59:04.880 --> 59:05.760
Just tell them on Twitter,

59:05.760 --> 59:06.640
like, hey, I live in this area

59:06.640 --> 59:08.320
and I'd really like to watch this show.

59:08.320 --> 59:09.520
I understand people are frustrated.

59:09.520 --> 59:10.800
Please don't be like mean about it

59:10.800 --> 59:12.720
and be like, fuck you guys.

59:15.280 --> 59:16.080
They were really nice

59:16.080 --> 59:18.240
and they let us make a TV show with a lot of money.

59:18.240 --> 59:18.640
Yeah.

59:18.640 --> 59:20.720
So like, I don't know, be nice.

59:20.720 --> 59:22.560
I want to thank John Roderick in the Long Winters

59:22.560 --> 59:24.080
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

59:24.080 --> 59:25.360
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

59:25.360 --> 59:25.920
Can I do that?

59:26.720 --> 59:27.360
Can I do that?

59:27.360 --> 59:28.160
Please do.

59:28.160 --> 59:28.720
Hey, thanks.

59:30.240 --> 59:31.600
That was it.

59:31.600 --> 59:32.640
Also to the international thing,

59:32.640 --> 59:35.040
I did want to say, if history is any indication,

59:35.040 --> 59:36.880
there will be one episode of the show

59:36.880 --> 59:39.280
that is freely available on YouTube.

59:39.280 --> 59:40.960
So everybody will at least be able to watch

59:40.960 --> 59:42.400
one episode of it, I believe.

59:43.200 --> 59:44.560
We're also working on an event

59:45.120 --> 59:46.880
on the 15th of this month

59:46.880 --> 59:48.480
that we're going to be streaming.

59:49.840 --> 59:52.800
And we are going to be doing kind of a press event,

59:52.800 --> 59:56.800
showing an episode and doing a Q&A afterwards,

59:56.800 --> 59:58.160
which you should be able to watch.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.600
Watch our Twitter stream and our Facebook page

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.960
for the details on that.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.520
Yeah, we should know more by next week's episode.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.600
So hopefully we'll have the details then.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.200
But we want to make sure we get as many people

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.560
included as possible.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.040
Thanks to MaxFun for having us.

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.160
Go to MaxFunFun.org.

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.520
Check out all the great podcasts there.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.920
Congrats to Jessie and Teresa having another baby.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.640
Very, very exciting.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.920
The Portland show sold out very, very quickly.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.320
Oh yeah.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.000
There's a thread started on the Facebook group

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.400
for people who weren't able to get tickets

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.360
and are looking for tickets.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.120
Cause there's always like, you got tickets

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.720
and then you found out you had to work that night

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.920
or something and you're not able to go.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.760
If you do end up with tickets that you're unable to use,

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.320
posting in the Facebook group is a super cool thing to do.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.280
And we know it sold out really quick.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.320
And we apologize that they went so fast,

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.960
but hopefully there'll be some ticket exchanges made

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.280
and some people who weren't able to attend are able to go.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.520
If you're going to be at that show and you have questions,

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.800
you can start sending them in now.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:02.480
Just put Portland live show in the subject line

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.560
so we can start grouping those questions together

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.320
and we'll see you there.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.760
Y'all want that final?

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:10.720
Yeah.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.600
Yes.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.280
I'm going to give it to you then here it comes.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:17.120
It's from, it was sent in by Dana Scarborough.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:17.600
Thank you, Dana.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.160
It's by Yahoo Answers user C who asks,

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:26.160
are flautists capable of expelling poison darts from a flute?

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:31.200
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.080
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.120
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.320
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.040
Kiss your dad.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:43.920
Square on the lips.

Going into a bullseye interview,

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.120
I know it's somebody who does amazing work,

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.720
but it's an actual conversation.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.000
I don't know where it's headed.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:08.720
Absolutely.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:09.760
You're absolutely right.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.360
You said it actually better than I did.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.200
So I have to think about what that means.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.280
Hey, this is the straight talk that you're going to get on this show.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:19.760
Bullseye.
