00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.380 --> 00:50.380
It's better, it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better, it's better with you

01:10.860 --> 01:16.780
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me the advice show for the modern era

01:16.780 --> 01:19.500
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:19.980 --> 01:23.100
And I am Travis the smooth

01:24.620 --> 01:30.460
I and this is Griffin McElroy the sweet baby brother, but that's not important

01:30.460 --> 01:34.220
What is important is happy birthday to all the presidents. Oh

01:35.100 --> 01:41.740
Happy birthday to all of the presidents who all got together and said wouldn't it kick total ass if we all had

01:41.740 --> 01:47.100
The same birthday and we called it Presidents Day and we just ripped shit up

01:47.100 --> 01:53.540
and had ourselves a good time because just a time to put partisan politics aside and

01:54.060 --> 01:59.500
Rip shit up rip shit with parties in politics. Yeah, there it goes

01:59.500 --> 02:04.900
the only political parties I want to hear about are the ones with beer and babes and

02:04.900 --> 02:11.820
We got a big pile of living presidents to fucking rock out with their cocks out to all

02:12.660 --> 02:20.300
All of them great. No notes. Yep. Well, no, there's lots of real dookie shitheads in there, but I mean

02:21.140 --> 02:22.980
We're out. We're out here

02:22.980 --> 02:29.540
They know how to party unlike any other person on earth because they've know they've had the nuclear codes and so they know they've partied

02:29.540 --> 02:36.420
With the aliens at Club 51. They've got it all baby. Who's all still alive?

02:36.420 --> 02:42.100
I bet it was weird for Abe Lincoln when they gave him the nuclear codes and he's like what the fuck are these for?

02:42.100 --> 02:45.300
What am I supposed to do with this? You'll find out

02:46.420 --> 02:51.140
But they told George Washington, here's the football and he's like what is football? What does that even mean?

02:51.540 --> 02:57.260
It's context. I don't understand any of the words. I'm gonna be honest. I'm confused by the case

02:57.260 --> 02:59.380
It's in is this metal? What the fuck?

03:00.860 --> 03:07.220
Anyway, metal wasn't invented. Well, they definitely weren't making briefcases out of it. If metal was invented yet

03:07.220 --> 03:11.940
Why is he gots with teeth? Thank you. He could have metal chompers like jaws. That's a little

03:12.580 --> 03:17.580
Presidential trivia. It's from you know what it is at that point Justin metal teeth were unprecedented

03:18.020 --> 03:21.820
You know what's funny about the president? Hey Justin, what the fuck?

03:22.660 --> 03:24.060
unprecedented

03:24.060 --> 03:29.500
Cuz he was a president. You didn't have to stop the flow. Yeah, but Justin just went right over it

03:29.500 --> 03:32.260
Okay, there's two different kinds of bits in this world trap

03:32.260 --> 03:34.780
There's the ones that you drive by and wave at though

03:34.780 --> 03:40.060
There's the ones that are you park and you have a little picnic outside of them, but that was not a picnic joke

03:41.420 --> 03:47.140
He didn't even huff at it or nothing, but if I stop and park the car at your joke

03:47.140 --> 03:49.920
Yeah, it's gonna make people think that you don't have those all the time

03:49.920 --> 03:53.560
But with your rapidity, you know what I mean? Yeah

03:56.600 --> 04:01.840
In quality and quantity, I mean they're all good girl good

04:02.920 --> 04:04.920
Baseline, you know, yeah

04:04.960 --> 04:10.680
This fucking Wikipedia article with all the presidents and it doesn't tell me which ones have biffed it

04:11.040 --> 04:17.400
Which one guess who is best and who is unbiffed and it sucks cuz I like want to talk about this

04:17.400 --> 04:20.520
I want to talk about this stuff. I know Ronald Reagan famously best

04:21.080 --> 04:26.080
Can I tell you them the one that always gets me Jimmy Carter Jimmy Carter unbiffed?

04:28.280 --> 04:36.040
Badland hookworms building houses beaten ass beaten ass beaten ass worm ass, you know the good thing about you

04:36.040 --> 04:42.180
Know this thing that I like about the US presidents. What is it? They've all been good. Yeah, no notes

04:42.180 --> 04:49.020
I would say El Presidente you're getting it done. I would say me and maybe you know

04:49.760 --> 04:51.560
Their birth shared

04:51.560 --> 04:58.040
Communal birthdays not the best dated sort of past judgment. Yeah, but I would say a couple of them have been real stinkers

04:58.040 --> 05:00.900
Oh, there are other thing about them is that they're all from Ohio

05:02.840 --> 05:04.840
Yeah, you guys heard this

05:05.920 --> 05:07.920
Cincinnati Joe

05:07.960 --> 05:12.040
Joe is one of the greatest traveling presidents. Oh, okay

05:12.040 --> 05:18.120
Yeah, we have a president of the rails and then the home president and there's one president that gets out there and gets it done

05:18.160 --> 05:23.040
It's like, you know how baseball teams have like home uniforms and away uniforms

05:23.040 --> 05:28.200
We have a home president and away president got away president never gets talked about it on these guys

05:28.200 --> 05:33.840
I'd like to I wish they would get away. Oh, wow, Justin. It's their birthday. It's their birthday, dude

05:33.840 --> 05:38.540
And was that these guys I wish they'd get away from me and my family and my guns

05:38.540 --> 05:44.140
Wait, are they near your family? What president is near your family? I just like him to stay out of my business

05:44.620 --> 05:51.260
You know citizen someone's fucked up guys. I'm still looking at this Wikipedia article. We've had like a group of presidents and

05:52.700 --> 05:57.820
Most of them are most of them are dead. Yeah. Yeah, so it's like basically

05:57.820 --> 06:03.900
Yeah, maybe this is the most dangerous. I know cops is always out there saying like or jobs the most dangerous. Uh

06:03.900 --> 06:09.620
Uh looking at the stats. I think it might be presidents because we've had almost 50 of them and like

06:09.860 --> 06:14.500
45 of them left a long time ago. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Some of them pretty

06:15.460 --> 06:20.660
Like quickly, I was like in office. Yeah, I'm just saying that's eerie right? What are the odds?

06:21.380 --> 06:23.380
Yeah, I'm finally president

06:28.660 --> 06:30.660
I'd like to be president someday, but yeah

06:30.660 --> 06:37.340
Do you think my birthday is not that day so like I can't do you are you have been in Ohio for quite a while

06:37.340 --> 06:42.180
That is true. That is true. I do appreciate it. Thank you for that vote of confidence you guys saying I would make

06:42.180 --> 06:44.180
Well, that's the only vote you'd get from me

06:44.780 --> 06:50.060
You're my brother. You're my blood Justin. I would be such a good president brother

06:50.300 --> 06:55.140
Don't you think that I would be a good like first brother black sheep like oh, yeah

06:55.140 --> 06:58.860
That's the one that makes beer or gross peanuts or whatever. These guys are doing

06:58.860 --> 07:02.860
Hey, how dare you assume that if any one of us became president?

07:02.860 --> 07:08.060
I wouldn't be the black sheep, but even if I was president they'd be like he's also the black sheep brother

07:08.060 --> 07:12.160
Thank you very much. I have purple hair Justin. I'm edgy

07:13.460 --> 07:19.140
Okay, fucking jughead. I'm the edgy one. I'm a weirdo. I'm a weirdo

07:19.140 --> 07:23.420
Don't you see that my hair is not a natural human color. It's not a normal color

07:23.420 --> 07:27.820
This isn't a color. I was born without the womb Justin. I chose this

07:27.820 --> 07:30.060
I'm a guy who makes choices. I'm edgy

07:30.940 --> 07:32.300
anyway

07:32.300 --> 07:33.660
Happy birthday, everyone

07:33.660 --> 07:39.840
I do think it is fucked up that this holiday did start off as a celebration of George Washington's birthday, which is February 22nd

07:39.840 --> 07:41.840
but then at some point people were like

07:42.100 --> 07:48.700
You sorry George. You got to share it. You got to share it with everyone today there. What are we doing this year?

07:48.700 --> 07:51.140
When we sell I'm not gonna lie this fucking sucks

07:51.140 --> 07:57.180
Suck shit. Missed it by a day this year. We're almost on top of it again, Georgie boy. I'm so sorry

07:57.180 --> 08:00.780
Happy belated birthday. Happy belated birthday to all the presidents

08:01.420 --> 08:06.020
William McKinley. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, our McKinley-est president

08:06.020 --> 08:08.020
Grover Cleveland?

08:08.340 --> 08:15.580
That was pretty good. Yeah, I do a pretty kick-ass Grover. I do an okay Elmo. I do an okay Rutherford B. Hayes

08:15.580 --> 08:17.580
Can we hear it?

08:17.580 --> 08:19.580
I'm Rutherford B. Hayes

08:19.580 --> 08:21.580
And I'm a president

08:21.580 --> 08:24.940
I'm the president that um, hold on

08:25.580 --> 08:31.660
Hold on. Let me Google. Just a moment, please. Uh-oh. I didn't do

08:32.540 --> 08:34.540
Let me see

08:34.700 --> 08:37.260
No, how'd we do just looking over this?

08:38.660 --> 08:46.460
Mmm, his critics to write his leniency toward the former Confederate states and his withdrawal of federal support for African Americans voting and civil rights

08:46.460 --> 08:48.460
Okay, never mind. I'm a big shithead

08:48.460 --> 08:50.460
I'm a real piece of shit

08:50.460 --> 08:54.260
I'm a real dick. Anyway, happy birthday to B

08:55.180 --> 08:57.100
Can we start this show now?

08:57.100 --> 09:03.420
We already did, bud. This is it. Your whole Rutherford B. Hayes bit is in there. Yeah, I wanted

09:03.700 --> 09:09.380
This is not a bit. I just I saw this earlier this morning on Facebook. Thank you for clarifying that

09:09.380 --> 09:13.140
This isn't a bit, Justin. This isn't a bit. I don't have like a whole bunch of funny things to say about it

09:13.140 --> 09:20.060
I literally just wanted to tell you to and if the listener listening audience enjoys it

09:20.060 --> 09:23.780
That's that's their business. It's not it's not mine. I just want to share with you guys

09:23.780 --> 09:28.300
I saw the most West Virginia. Well one of the most like West Virginia headlines

09:28.940 --> 09:33.540
On Facebook today breaking 13 news has learned that the current and former

09:33.900 --> 09:40.460
Owners of the Charleston Town Center and the city of Charleston are being sued by the developer of the future hotel in the old Sears

09:40.460 --> 09:46.260
Building. Oh boy. It's just that's that's us. That's us there, baby

09:46.260 --> 09:52.100
That's everybody suing everybody in the future hotel of the old Sears Building. Yeah, buddy. I love it

09:52.100 --> 09:54.100
I wish it was a futuristic hotel

09:55.980 --> 09:57.980
Same thing Justin

09:59.340 --> 10:01.140
Just a big cube

10:01.140 --> 10:03.620
Yeah, I'd love that. Um, I

10:04.660 --> 10:07.820
May I permission to speak from the heart fellas? Yeah, sure

10:07.820 --> 10:12.780
Um, so last week I did a riddle me piss. Yeah, and

10:13.380 --> 10:16.980
Some folks made me cognizant of the fact that I had

10:17.780 --> 10:21.740
Used that in the past episode 511. Yeah

10:22.620 --> 10:26.380
That's not even that long. It's not that long ago. I was flabbergasted to find that out

10:26.980 --> 10:32.140
And honestly, it made me moist and I don't want to obfuscate the point. Oh, no, I'm feeling

10:32.140 --> 10:37.020
very exotic and actually substitute in actually apologizing for something you can't

10:37.020 --> 10:40.620
make up for it by doing a much worse thing. And I want to postulate before you

10:42.060 --> 10:48.480
Listen, honestly, I'm feeling very perspicacious right now. Justin, not at all. I'm a little bit ornery. Is there a way to mute him?

10:48.480 --> 10:55.220
I like it now. I bring you I bring you this corduroy and this oubliette and I hope that you accept this ephemera

10:56.140 --> 11:01.660
As my sincere globular. Okay. And and listen, I'm spackled over here

11:01.660 --> 11:05.040
You know what I mean? And I hope that you all can widdershins me

11:06.980 --> 11:14.420
That we can you know move past this can we just as long as we are lifting the fucking riddle me piss Jersey up to

11:14.420 --> 11:17.020
The Raptors, which is what we're not. Oh, no, no, no

11:19.740 --> 11:23.520
You actually I locked it I super glued it to the fucking ceiling

11:23.980 --> 11:26.940
So as long as we've got those sort of just shut down with a crossbow

11:26.940 --> 11:33.620
Hell yeah, it's falling as long as we got the rig out that we use for lifting jerseys up to the rafters

11:33.620 --> 11:35.620
Can we go ahead and just hook?

11:36.220 --> 11:41.900
Sad libs up on there, too. Oh my god. That was a sad libs. I didn't even notice Griffin. Oh, wow

11:42.860 --> 11:45.500
You know, I guess it just it comes so naturally, you know

11:45.500 --> 11:53.420
What sucks is we actually have a real announcement, which is that in our sad sack state last week crying about smartless beating our asses

11:53.420 --> 11:59.300
Up and down the street. We didn't talk very much about our live show that we have coming up this this week. Yeah

11:59.300 --> 12:02.740
Yeah, it's this week. You can get tickets at bit.ly slash

12:02.980 --> 12:09.380
Bim-bam virtual is February 26 and tickets are 10 bucks a pop and we'll have a video on demand for two weeks after so come

12:09.380 --> 12:12.600
Out and do and join us. We haven't done this in a couple months

12:12.600 --> 12:17.400
And it's like a very fun time asking has been one this Griffin in very good sales job

12:17.400 --> 12:22.300
So now he really missed it. I he biffed it. I want to say that these things are always wild

12:22.300 --> 12:24.660
They're always fun. The more people that are there

12:25.380 --> 12:30.980
You feel the energy in the crowd. It gets trending people are tweeting about what they're seeing

12:30.980 --> 12:32.980
yeah, we'll have a lots of

12:33.180 --> 12:36.940
Great surprises that tribes been working on and I'm

12:37.860 --> 12:43.980
Fuck I gotta go guys. I'm gonna do a fucking backflip. I'm not doing any no characters

12:43.980 --> 12:47.620
There won't be any Richard stink so that if that's a plus for you

12:47.620 --> 12:51.500
You got that to look forward to oh, you know what I could do

12:51.500 --> 12:55.860
I could do with musical guest and have the video clips play

12:57.740 --> 12:59.740
Yeah, I like that

13:01.740 --> 13:03.740
Please come please

13:05.380 --> 13:11.100
Amanda got mad at us because we didn't talk about it last week when there were only two weeks to push it and we fucked

13:11.100 --> 13:18.420
It up so bad. We feel really guilty. So if you go buy a ticket or two, that would be badass anyway

13:20.020 --> 13:25.260
So this is a this is an advice show, I mean, I don't know how else to say it. Yeah, there it is

13:25.260 --> 13:30.040
You know what? I mean? This is an advice show. Let's lay all our cards on the table. What does it say?

13:30.040 --> 13:32.740
It's an advice show across all the cards gin

13:33.500 --> 13:35.500
begin

13:36.060 --> 13:38.060
When you're ready

13:38.060 --> 13:42.660
Now Justin in your own time just if you would do your slate

13:43.220 --> 13:45.780
Please announce who you are. What pieces you'll be doing

13:47.260 --> 13:48.660
Hi

13:48.660 --> 13:51.740
My name is Justin McElroy. I'll be doing a

13:53.180 --> 13:57.700
Place don't say you'll be doing it. That makes it sound a little bit perverted if you could use a different

13:58.060 --> 14:03.220
Yeah, it makes it sound like you're gonna try and have sex. I'll be I'll be humping this question

14:03.220 --> 14:09.020
That's a little bit worse. So I work at a fancy legal office and I have to commute by bus

14:09.580 --> 14:12.980
Say Boston legal we get it. We know where it is

14:13.620 --> 14:15.620
You work with Denny Crane

14:16.100 --> 14:18.100
Why do I know that?

14:22.140 --> 14:24.740
There's so much shit you don't know Travis

14:27.860 --> 14:33.060
Because the other day I was talking about how Boston legal and Boston public are in the same Boston verse

14:33.060 --> 14:37.300
But Boston common is not and that makes me really mad. Sorry, go on

14:39.860 --> 14:44.500
Just go on I'm fairly new and not used to the 8 to 5 grind yet

14:44.940 --> 14:52.100
So I find myself staying up far too late to be waking up at 645 every day and then getting to work exhausted now

14:52.100 --> 14:56.860
I haven't finished this question, but so far there's a pretty good. Yeah answer for this

14:56.860 --> 15:00.300
Yeah, I have an hour lunch break and really want to take a nap

15:00.300 --> 15:05.900
Yes, would it be inappropriate to stack boxes in my cubicle to hide in and get some sleep?

15:05.900 --> 15:10.380
I worry that someone might see me in there, but I'm just so tired right now

15:10.380 --> 15:16.380
I decay if I can make it through the day, please help us from pooped in Portland now

15:16.380 --> 15:18.380
Listen, I've just been pointed out

15:18.700 --> 15:25.660
Obviously obviously we could say go to bed earlier, but that's not one like that's not fun

15:25.660 --> 15:29.460
And also like when you read when you reach a certain age

15:29.460 --> 15:34.060
No amount of sleep is enough to get you through the day, right? Yeah

15:35.100 --> 15:38.100
You could go to sleep right after you got up and you'd be tired

15:38.100 --> 15:44.020
and it's also completely arbitrary because you'll also have days where you sleep for five hours and you wake up and you feel

15:44.460 --> 15:49.900
Incredible and then you'll have days where you sleep nine hours and you feel like some sort of corpse person

15:50.020 --> 15:52.580
Because the weird thing is your body has these weird cycles

15:52.580 --> 15:55.420
But you don't fucking know when they are and you're in no control of it

15:55.420 --> 15:59.060
And it's like oh you woke up in the middle one. I'm like, okay. Well whose fault is that?

15:59.060 --> 16:04.900
Yeah, this is why this is why so many people have endorsed polyphasic sleep. Yes

16:04.900 --> 16:12.220
Where you'll chunk it out you get some 90 minutes polyphasic sleep is my favorite thing to talk about and never do

16:12.220 --> 16:17.060
Yep, so you do like sleep for 90 minutes and then you're up. Who's that creeper on the house at 430?

16:17.060 --> 16:21.860
Well, it's Justin who's that taking a nap at 1130 during the morning meeting? That's Justin

16:21.860 --> 16:25.220
He sleeps for 90 minutes and he's up for a while polyphasic sleep now

16:25.220 --> 16:30.620
I'm of two minds in the actual question here and I want you guys to gut check where you're at

16:30.620 --> 16:34.380
I don't think there's anything wrong with taking a nap on your lunch break. That's your time

16:34.380 --> 16:38.540
I think the problem is location location location, right? Yeah, right

16:38.540 --> 16:45.280
I think you need to find within any office or warehouse or I don't care where it is

16:45.740 --> 16:48.580
There is a location that somebody knows about

16:48.580 --> 16:54.580
That's like the comfy spot where everyone sneaks away to nap. Well, I wouldn't want a nap

16:54.580 --> 16:58.380
I wouldn't want a nap in the spot where everyone goes to nap

16:58.420 --> 17:04.020
Do you know like I that's not necessarily something I want to share with my peers. Mmm. That's fair

17:04.020 --> 17:08.980
I don't at the same time. I feel like if somebody is ever like, you know

17:10.140 --> 17:14.420
Reorganizing the office and they move a file cabinet and then there's like a fucking

17:14.420 --> 17:19.420
Shawshank Redemption hole in the wall with like some some pillows and

17:20.420 --> 17:25.300
Newspapers in there you they would that is no good man. If somebody's

17:27.060 --> 17:31.620
Nest your Bruno nest has been discovered. You can't stay in there. No nest. Yeah

17:32.300 --> 17:34.300
It's inappropriate

17:34.380 --> 17:40.860
But I think if you just go to sleep on your fucking desk head down and if anybody walks in and it's like hey

17:40.860 --> 17:43.340
Wake up leave that job. Oh, you know what?

17:43.340 --> 17:46.900
We haven't done this in a while. What would a sign help? Oh

17:48.340 --> 17:52.220
Seeping seeping because that's the problem right they come by they see you laying down

17:52.220 --> 17:56.060
They're like gosh shirking their duties, but if you have a sign that's like this is my lunch break

17:56.060 --> 17:59.540
This is how I choose to use it Derek. Yeah, right. Like what are they gonna do?

17:59.860 --> 18:03.860
Yeah, I ate so fast Eric and I have to sleep

18:03.860 --> 18:09.820
I eat while I type out my reports so that I can have a snooze arena and it says all of this

18:09.820 --> 18:15.820
There's like eight pieces. It's a daisy wheel printer. Just like yeah now all lined up and there's still reading it

18:15.820 --> 18:17.900
By the time you wake up. That was my shit

18:17.900 --> 18:20.260
I would eat lunch while I had like

18:20.500 --> 18:28.100
Library duty during like third period in middle school and then when lunchtime came around I could keep hanging out in the library

18:28.220 --> 18:30.220
Yeah, that's a sad story

18:34.620 --> 18:38.060
Anyway, hey, do you guys want to approach the wizard?

18:38.060 --> 18:42.900
Whatever you do. Yes, don't nap in the break room. Well, no

18:45.500 --> 18:47.500
Just stop napping no what

18:47.740 --> 18:53.380
Yes, don't nap get out of here. You're you're up to it. Okay, you're having trouble going to sleep on time

18:53.380 --> 18:59.380
So you can't yeah, it hurts to wake up at 645 you take a nap. You're continuing that terrible cycle break it

18:59.380 --> 19:02.320
All right tired and then go to bed at night. No

19:02.820 --> 19:06.700
Yes, mr. Polyphasic sleep who then turns around says, you know what though?

19:06.700 --> 19:10.900
Hey, forget everything. I said don't nap. No, don't nap. Oh

19:11.380 --> 19:18.580
Justin polyphasic sleep is just grown-up nap time. No, I don't endorse polyphasic sleep. It's just it may sound like you did

19:20.380 --> 19:26.500
Normal time if you see Jimmy Fallon, you've gone too far. Yeah, that's it. Go to bed all the time. Wake up in all the time

19:28.180 --> 19:32.220
Okay, so just just go to sleep at a normal time

19:32.220 --> 19:36.940
Stop napping your day away. Oh my god, if the digital clock has four numbers on it

19:36.940 --> 19:40.260
You know, there's love napping and it drives me fuck love napping

19:40.300 --> 19:43.500
They'll be at my home having a family visit and they're like, well

19:43.700 --> 19:48.540
That's the cuckoo clock on the wall says it's time for me to get my jammies and have a little nap nap

19:48.540 --> 19:53.940
Yeah, and it's like come on, but you're together. We're having fun. Stop fucking napping

19:53.940 --> 19:58.140
But you're willfully refusing to do it so that you can be unhappy for the rest

19:58.140 --> 20:02.260
No, you do it one time and I one time and then you're on a good schedule

20:02.260 --> 20:07.660
I think it's pretty fucked up whenever we're like partying and then you're like we need to eat

20:07.660 --> 20:12.140
We haven't eaten in 14 hours because you won't stop partying and I'm like rude much

20:12.500 --> 20:17.000
Right trying to fulfill your body's needs while I'm trying to fucking party with you

20:17.000 --> 20:22.100
I also when we're all hanging out as a family and you're like, well 730 p.m. Time for beddy-bye and I'm like what?

20:22.100 --> 20:28.300
I'm Justin's favorite game Justin's favorite game to play when we're all hanging out of this family is he waits until somebody is on their

20:28.300 --> 20:34.740
Phone and then get gets to get this really slam them for it. Like yeah, we're only so rarely

20:34.740 --> 20:39.340
I think that's what gives you guys are addicted to your devices. You're just constantly

20:39.340 --> 20:41.420
Well, I'm just talking to my real friends and the babes

20:42.020 --> 20:44.020
Yeah, okay

20:44.140 --> 20:46.140
Yeah, okay. So you're going to

20:46.820 --> 20:50.280
Do a wizard of the cloud. I think we should definitely do that. Okay

20:50.280 --> 20:55.640
All right. So this one is sent in by a lot of people. So thank you to everybody for your contributions

20:56.620 --> 21:00.340
It's like they built a human staircase leading up to the Wizards

21:01.300 --> 21:03.300
The wizard would love that

21:04.620 --> 21:09.000
Yep, what's the pulp no pupit that's where he turns into a boot or fly

21:10.020 --> 21:12.820
So this is how to prank in school school gets boring sometimes

21:12.820 --> 21:19.740
So if you want to liven up a few pranks who could blame you? Thank you someone who catches you doing well

21:19.740 --> 21:25.620
No, even that man. Okay. The question is driven and we haven't gotten into I'm sure we will but when it comes to you

21:25.620 --> 21:30.020
Well, they blame you are they lovable pranks or are they like, oh, that's what I think

21:30.020 --> 21:32.980
Well, they they run the gamut trap using your school supplies

21:32.980 --> 21:37.780
It's a fun way to get started or you could just prank friends with food tricks or electronic tricks

21:38.940 --> 21:41.700
Tronic trick, that's great. That's like Mysterio

21:42.820 --> 21:49.460
Whenever anonymous drones involved whenever anonymous is in the news again, like oh shit. They leaked all the Pentagon's shit

21:49.460 --> 21:53.780
I'll be like what an electronic trick. That's a great electronic trick. They oh no

21:53.780 --> 22:00.220
Someone stole my identity and took all my bitcoins. What a brutal electronic trick bunch of stinkers

22:01.020 --> 22:04.180
With blockchain it would be really difficult for someone to steal

22:04.780 --> 22:10.060
Yeah, damn, you're right Trev. That's a good enough reason for me to put all my money into cyber coin

22:10.060 --> 22:12.060
Just like a bronze said to do

22:13.740 --> 22:18.460
Yeah, Super Bowl using school supplies replace correcting fluid with lip tint

22:18.460 --> 22:22.220
So there's some fucked up. Yeah white out with oh

22:23.380 --> 22:30.540
Lip tint, I guess lip smackers lip smackers thoroughly clean out a bottle of correcting fluid then snip off the brush glue in an old

22:30.540 --> 22:35.940
Lip tint applicator and pour lip tint into the bottle when your friend tries to borrow it. They'll be really confused

22:35.940 --> 22:39.940
I mean that seems like a lot of work for a little payoff

22:40.780 --> 22:47.820
Mmm, or even better payoff would be like while your friend's looking pull out the white out and apply it to your lips

22:47.820 --> 22:53.540
Like your friends like what the fuck are you doing? That's way better than your friend like, okay

22:53.540 --> 22:58.100
I guess this isn't white out the best part about that electronic trick is that

22:58.700 --> 23:05.260
It definitely is worse for the friend who sees you put white out on your mouth then you the person who just put

23:05.740 --> 23:10.260
Almost certainly extremely poisonous white out on your mouth. That's funny

23:10.320 --> 23:14.100
No, I'm gonna go to the trouble of cleaning out the bottle to put your lip tint in there

23:14.100 --> 23:19.540
Yeah, use it as lip tint. Anyway, make edible school supplies from sugar paste to confuse your friends

23:20.180 --> 23:25.180
Yeah, man, and then you start chowing down on your eraser or paperclips and your friends won't know what's happening

23:25.700 --> 23:29.780
And they won't be your friends anymore. Probably not once they find out that you have been

23:30.660 --> 23:38.340
Cooking pencils. I've seen a lot guys. I've seen a lot of these types of suggestions in like Troom Troom vids

23:38.340 --> 23:44.740
and why my kids are obsessed trim trim, you know, they're like, um, Eastern European pals

23:44.740 --> 23:48.560
And they make videos about how to like sneak candy in the school

23:48.620 --> 23:53.060
Yeah, or one where you have to sneak a superhero into a movie theater. And yeah, exactly

23:53.060 --> 24:00.220
I like why we only eat orange things all that, you know trim trim. Okay, my kids just watch a lot of educational stuff

24:00.220 --> 24:05.140
Oh, yeah, this is educational because if you want to sneak, you know, candy buttons in you can make a jacket

24:05.140 --> 24:08.520
Decorated with candy buttons. Yeah, teacher won't know

24:09.780 --> 24:15.460
You could be teaching your kids about cost-benefit analysis to realize that that's a stupid thing to do

24:15.460 --> 24:16.780
But come on no cost of it

24:16.780 --> 24:19.940
They know that the cost of the snacks in the movie theater is ridiculous

24:19.940 --> 24:25.660
so high so they got a far more beforehand and they make a little like a beret out of

24:26.300 --> 24:28.300
razzles

24:28.300 --> 24:30.300
A

24:33.980 --> 24:36.060
Never come back. This is a drive-by joke

24:36.060 --> 24:36.740
Yeah

24:36.740 --> 24:42.040
Use clear nail polish to make a pencil useless paint the tip of a pencil with clear nail polish on your friend borrow it when

24:42.040 --> 24:47.880
They try to use it. It won't right. That's perfect. I like that one. That's a good cell phone to a good what?

24:48.660 --> 24:56.140
Self-own. Oh, I think you said cell phone. I thought that too. I also thought that me if he's if you pencil

24:56.140 --> 24:58.140
If

24:58.220 --> 25:02.280
You had a pencil and you started talking to it like it was a cell phone. That's funny. Come on

25:02.980 --> 25:07.380
Paint clear nail polish all over your friend's cell phone. That's cool. Oh, that's good, too

25:07.820 --> 25:10.060
Then they try to put their finger to it. It won't work

25:10.220 --> 25:14.500
Yeah, or they put it to their face to make a phone call and then they immediately huff it and pass out

25:16.100 --> 25:18.100
Polish on your nails

25:19.060 --> 25:21.660
Your friends like my nails look healthy

25:21.660 --> 25:26.980
Yeah, gotcha. Yeah, stupid. What is hot clear nail polish on your friend's nails and they're like, oh, thank you

25:27.700 --> 25:34.180
Add hot glue to your sharpener before letting someone borrow it do people do we're done with pencils and sharpeners and yeah

25:34.740 --> 25:40.520
Right add hot glue to your tablet, but it's school supplied or whatever these days probably

25:43.860 --> 25:45.860
Crank they'd be on the wall. Oh, yeah

25:45.860 --> 25:50.860
I love that shit. Yeah had the crank. I loved that. Yeah. Oh with pencils. Yes

25:51.900 --> 25:54.220
Manual pencil sharpeners. That's what we had to deal with

25:54.980 --> 25:59.340
I had a sharpened a piece of obsidian, but I would use

26:01.060 --> 26:07.820
And my teacher like where the fuck did you get that and I'd be like back off I got it from minecraft

26:11.220 --> 26:14.500
Time to take out your test. Oh shit. Hold up. I gotta go minecraft myself a pen

26:14.500 --> 26:20.100
Yeah, what I dig dig down deep for the flant. I make myself a pencil from my shit a creeper. No

26:20.940 --> 26:25.280
Don't say that. You don't say that about the janitor. He's cuby and green. Yeah

26:26.700 --> 26:34.260
He's made of cues. Yeah. Yeah now give him up for the grace of God goes out. I don't I don't really

26:35.060 --> 26:39.020
Even if he wasn't made of cubes and green I wouldn't do that. You're exploding

26:39.020 --> 26:42.780
Janitor, oh, I hate that noise. He's making

26:44.300 --> 26:46.060
I'm not doing it

26:46.060 --> 26:51.700
Make a crayon eraser for a pencil this one if you kill the janitor you get feathers and it's worth it

26:51.700 --> 26:54.860
That is worth it and creepers drop going powder not feather. It's okay

26:54.860 --> 27:03.060
What what create a retracting pin with a spring isn't that? Oh, wait, that's what I did. Yeah, you get those wonderful toys

27:03.060 --> 27:10.300
That's a great prank cuz your friend will then be like hey your pins broken and you'll be I know I broke it

27:10.380 --> 27:17.260
So confuse your teacher. This is a step to pulling pranks in the classroom have mechanical pencils. Let's just do it

27:17.260 --> 27:20.060
Yeah, yeah, fuck it. Oh, no, let's read the bandage off

27:20.140 --> 27:25.500
Why did someone invent a pencil lead destroyer because that's all they are they don't write

27:25.500 --> 27:29.580
They just break and then you put more out and they break again. They made that shit so thin

27:29.580 --> 27:37.020
It's so good and pointless. Yeah, it is good for pretending like you're giving yourself like I don't know an injection or something. Yeah

27:39.020 --> 27:42.380
Prank, but you got to make sure you push the stopper down or it fucking hurts

27:42.940 --> 27:47.820
We're getting into the good stuff now confuse your teacher by changing their wallpaper to a screenshot

27:48.220 --> 27:51.140
So that when they try to click the icons, it doesn't work

27:51.140 --> 27:56.060
But I'm sorry if you get caught doing anything on your teacher's laptop

27:56.060 --> 28:00.420
Oh, yeah, you're going to fucking you're going down. You're done. You're going downtown

28:01.260 --> 28:07.320
Ink your sleeping friend if they fall asleep in the library or class dip their fingers in an ink pad or makeup

28:07.700 --> 28:12.140
You can also use a highlighter then tickle their nose with a feather or tissue when they go to scratch their nose

28:12.340 --> 28:13.700
They'll get ink on their face

28:13.700 --> 28:18.380
Why not if you want to help their face if you want to help them get it off try a little hand sanitizer

28:18.380 --> 28:20.860
that's a great point Travis as long as you're

28:20.860 --> 28:26.580
You're cut out the middleman right of the finger and just put ink on your friend's fucking face

28:26.580 --> 28:31.100
Unless you're trying to convince that they got fingerprinted while they were asleep. That's that would work

28:31.100 --> 28:33.220
It's like oh man, you've been gone for so long

28:33.220 --> 28:35.540
They took you downtown and then like a matrix

28:35.540 --> 28:39.700
They just dropped you back off and I think that there's some kind of mechanical worm in your tummy. We gotta get it out

28:40.300 --> 28:47.220
Yeah, use a coffee cup to spill water on your teacher. That's what's gonna go over great. That is good

28:47.220 --> 28:51.740
There's a description here of how to create a prank cup

28:52.380 --> 28:57.500
Using cling wrap several layers of cling wrap and a rubber band and the more I read it the more

28:58.940 --> 29:00.780
My brain

29:00.780 --> 29:06.380
Rebels against itself. Yes, it's a it's a feat of engineering that I do not think is possible. But what do they suggest?

29:07.060 --> 29:11.180
What I'm not gonna read it. That's what I'm saying is why no, we don't want to endorse too much

29:11.180 --> 29:13.420
Can I just say a lot of these sound like something?

29:13.420 --> 29:19.780
Have like middle school Travis would do not because he was a creative prank genius, but because he had impulse control issues

29:20.580 --> 29:24.600
Not so much like pranks, but just more like oh, why did you do that? I don't I don't know

29:24.900 --> 29:28.780
Yeah, I don't think spilling water on your teacher is a great prank

29:28.780 --> 29:31.260
But I do love the little tip they've added at the end here

29:31.260 --> 29:35.940
Which is to keep your teacher in a good mood after pulling this prank have a towel and a real cup of coffee on hand

29:35.940 --> 29:41.700
For afterwards. Sorry Dolores. Here you go. Sorry here try yourself up. You look fucking ridiculous

29:41.700 --> 29:48.620
I have access to coffee. So anyway, I got you take it with two creams with sugar. Am I right? Yeah, how about a back row?

29:49.500 --> 29:53.660
Who's going to take a cup from you ever again when they say you do this?

29:55.220 --> 30:01.900
This in feet of engineering that you've used to soak your teacher who's gonna just done an incredible prank

30:01.900 --> 30:06.340
You have undermined any trust that teacher had for you for the rest of the year

30:06.340 --> 30:08.660
You're gonna the next parent teacher conference here

30:08.660 --> 30:12.100
She's gonna be like, listen, they're getting straight A's because of course rule number one keep your grades up

30:12.260 --> 30:17.540
But they're like fucking Loki in here. Actually, you know, it's fucked up. It doesn't say anything about

30:19.220 --> 30:22.500
Guess what? Wiggy house playing a prank on you. Oh, that's right

30:22.620 --> 30:26.140
Because they're gonna have a hard time expelling you when you're valedictorian

30:26.140 --> 30:31.020
Yeah, cover your teacher's desk and candy this prank will actually make your teacher smile

30:31.020 --> 30:35.900
You can't even use candy to make a picture or spell out something for your teacher. Fuck you. Mr. Dennis

30:35.900 --> 30:39.260
But also it's mentos, but it's mentos, baby

30:40.140 --> 30:47.540
Fucking that's right. It is mentos in the picture in a picture. I wrote this one. Oh, okay. Hey take two

30:48.180 --> 30:53.540
Textbook pages together so your Frank can't find them use double-sided tape to stick the front page to a chapter to a page before

30:53.540 --> 30:56.140
Your friend won't be able to find it when they open their book

30:56.660 --> 31:01.420
which is fun because they could be like man, why these two pages stuck together and be like I

31:01.420 --> 31:09.580
I got really excited while reading about trigonometry and busted one and I'm sorry for that. I

31:10.300 --> 31:16.820
Apologize trigonometry just does it for me. I know how big that triangle is and I guess my gets my noodle going

31:18.940 --> 31:20.940
Put balloons everywhere

31:22.820 --> 31:26.620
Hallways classrooms cafeterias you name it you can even fill a whole room with balloons

31:26.620 --> 31:28.820
People won't be able to move without running into balloons

31:28.820 --> 31:32.280
Hey everywhere everywhere. Hey, um

31:32.860 --> 31:37.020
Jimmy my son, but you seem so tired and stressed. I have a lot of my plate mom

31:37.020 --> 31:40.900
I don't understand the pressure. It started simple. It started simple

31:40.900 --> 31:47.140
I put some clear Nile plush on a pencil and everyone's like you're the prank King Jimmy and then I had to keep escalating and now

31:47.140 --> 31:49.140
I'm blowing up millions of balloons

31:49.500 --> 31:54.220
So I can what put him in the client the hallway everywhere mom. What have I done?

31:54.220 --> 32:00.720
We need to move so I need to move schools mom. I promise. I'm not angry. I just need to know I have a

32:01.420 --> 32:07.660
$2,500 charge from Party City. Yeah card. It's out of control mom. Okay, mom

32:07.660 --> 32:14.300
I I pranked myself mom. It's okay. The ultimate prank was on Jimmy you pranked your future

32:14.300 --> 32:16.300
You pranked your way out of that big scholarship

32:16.700 --> 32:20.980
No, this one kicks ass bring watermelons to school. Hell, yeah

32:20.980 --> 32:23.260
Gallagher got him this prank doesn't sound that crazy

32:23.260 --> 32:27.420
But try to get a lot of people to bring at least two watermelons to school then have them leave them all over the school

32:27.420 --> 32:30.140
Your school will be covered in watermelons

32:30.860 --> 32:34.700
Now this assumes that you're of an age to purchase your own watermelons, right?

32:34.700 --> 32:40.980
Because this is this prank carries the much more difficult step of convince your parents

32:40.980 --> 32:44.340
You need to take two watermelons to school. Yeah, well home at

32:45.380 --> 32:47.380
Yeah, okay, but play that out Griffin

32:47.380 --> 32:52.420
My mom I need to bring two watermelons to school for home economics. What are you guys doing in class?

32:52.420 --> 32:54.580
What are you using them for chubby twins?

32:56.300 --> 32:59.820
Chubby twin. Oh, this is we're taking care of babies and I got taking care of two

33:00.620 --> 33:05.880
Extremely heavy babies at this our teacher wants that teachers are very specific lesson about responsibility

33:06.220 --> 33:09.940
Yeah, and also we have to provide the watermelons their work

33:09.940 --> 33:15.620
They're in cahoots with gym teacher who wants us to get fucking yelped. So we gotta carry these two big watermelons around

33:15.620 --> 33:20.380
Well, then what do I pay taxes for shouldn't the school provide the watermelons young Jimmy trap?

33:20.380 --> 33:22.700
That's I mean, we know the state of things

33:24.700 --> 33:26.900
If you bring that up to your parents like well

33:26.900 --> 33:32.180
I I just know that when miss Doris asked she was in tears cuz she was like, I'm sorry

33:32.180 --> 33:34.260
We can't provide the melon. I'm sorry. That makes me so sad

33:34.820 --> 33:37.420
Wrap your principal's car and plastic wrap whatever whatever whatever

33:38.180 --> 33:44.100
Use toilet paper to cover the front of your school for a classic prank. Yeah, that's awesome. Why that's a lot of toilet paper

33:44.100 --> 33:48.380
Yeah, well this one get your friends to help you cover the football field in plastic forks

33:49.060 --> 33:53.180
The most trouble I ever saw anyone get in at my high school

33:53.420 --> 33:57.940
Was a group of kids who forked the football field and they forked it fucking good

33:58.980 --> 34:03.580
And like they had to miss like the team had to miss at practice that day

34:03.580 --> 34:05.580
Oh the worst thing that could happen

34:05.580 --> 34:09.580
That's the worst thing that could happen at a high school not the 15 person fight

34:09.580 --> 34:11.580
I saw on the first day of my freshman year

34:11.580 --> 34:16.620
Well, that's how you I mean count that fast. Why could you even count that?

34:16.620 --> 34:20.420
Well, five of them were teachers who waited in and then I think got caught up in the moment

34:20.420 --> 34:24.300
Yeah, everybody knows that if you get the opportunity to pop a kid. It's like

34:26.500 --> 34:28.500
So the prince showed up and said

34:29.500 --> 34:34.820
Noble blood breaks to new mutiny and he separated the houses. It was awesome

34:35.580 --> 34:38.660
Hey, here's just one quick question in the community Q&A

34:38.660 --> 34:41.900
Could I go into the bathroom and go on my phone and call 9-1-1? Oh

34:46.220 --> 34:48.220
Could you

34:50.260 --> 34:57.660
Way better go in the bathroom and then call your teacher from the bathroom and say like I'm the principal and you're you fired

35:01.500 --> 35:07.340
That's awesome, hey, do you still have that copy of Jumanji in Spanish just put that on anyways

35:07.340 --> 35:10.000
I'm the principal and I gotta go fart to come and smell it

35:14.220 --> 35:16.220
That's all time you could do like a

35:16.540 --> 35:21.660
Mission impossible diarrhea poison and put that in the put that in the principal's cup

35:21.900 --> 35:25.420
And then when he's like, oh I gotta go. I'm so sick you go into the principal's office

35:25.420 --> 35:28.100
I was gonna smell my farts, but then it turned into that real

35:28.100 --> 35:32.980
Yeah, and then you get on the secret like Mikey has that gets on the PA and you're like everybody

35:32.980 --> 35:39.980
It's me principal stink and I said we're growing up what we did where? The only way you understand the product

35:39.980 --> 35:43.580
X lax as a magical chocolate that makes people who yeah

35:43.580 --> 35:50.620
Do you know how many times we saw X lax growing up as kids being snuck into teachers mugs and yeah

35:51.220 --> 35:52.940
babysitters, yeah

35:52.940 --> 35:56.900
Sandwiches, yeah instantly made them just like poop their brains out forever

35:56.900 --> 36:04.420
What's dope works? I never saw anyone in incredible gastrointestinal distress because of like horrific constipation

36:04.500 --> 36:06.660
And then they take X lax and then I like oh

36:07.260 --> 36:11.060
Thank goodness. I'm glad I took that X lax intentionally

36:12.060 --> 36:17.540
There was there was ever like like important business meeting at X lax HQ where they're like

36:17.620 --> 36:22.700
Do we need to get out in front of this? Yeah, we need to we need to start like a public health campaign, right?

36:22.700 --> 36:27.940
We're just like listen. I know what you all think right X lax. It's the diarrhea medicine, but that's not true

36:27.940 --> 36:32.860
We have a lot. There's a lot of benefits more specifically. It's the chocolate that makes you shit forever. Yeah, right

36:32.860 --> 36:33.300
Yeah

36:33.300 --> 36:41.300
It's it there needs to be like a tide pod make good campaign where the tide got in trouble because they made the most delicious looking

36:41.900 --> 36:46.900
Candy shaped objects ever and then had to come out and be like, it's not it isn't candy

36:46.900 --> 36:48.580
I know we're having a lot of fun here

36:48.580 --> 36:53.420
But you could die and just have X lax get out there and be like look I know we even made it

36:53.860 --> 37:01.900
Chocolate the most delicious thing we get it, but uh, it's uh, please no more jokes. This is serious diarrhea medicine

37:01.900 --> 37:07.020
It's serious. Stop. I just got home from school. And when I told him what you did for a living they all laughed

37:07.020 --> 37:12.940
It's not funny. It's my job helps people. I'm like a doctor. It's extremely serious

37:12.940 --> 37:20.060
I make the dookie medicine that helps people can't dookie. I make the chocolate that helps you fudge

37:21.020 --> 37:24.940
Anyway, I've been trying to pitch that as a new slogan, but so far

37:27.780 --> 37:29.780
This has not been our brightest hour

37:29.780 --> 37:40.560
And that's pretty sad considering we're we're only 35 minutes in oh no, okay. Well, let's go to the money zone. That's usually a good palate cleanser

37:49.120 --> 37:54.160
All right, let's shake it off let's get back in the jimmy's out again listen

37:54.160 --> 37:56.160
We've had a lot of wiggles now. It's time to focus up

37:56.160 --> 38:01.240
We're back into it and it's time to deliver the goods

38:02.080 --> 38:05.440
Justin take it. Don't think about it. Just go take the rock. Okay, a

38:06.360 --> 38:10.640
lot of people use Squarespace these days and they want to use it to make a great website I

38:11.760 --> 38:17.880
personally Justin McElroy have been using Squarespace for the past couple weeks to build a

38:18.600 --> 38:20.600
website for my wife Sydney

38:20.600 --> 38:23.040
Who is running for the House of Delegates here in West Virginia?

38:23.040 --> 38:29.440
And I built her website with the help of a trusted friend mainly to tell me if the things looked bad

38:29.440 --> 38:33.200
But I've been he built it and I've been editing

38:33.960 --> 38:36.860
Editing it. Well now I'm sorry, but the story keeps changing

38:37.560 --> 38:42.600
Yes, I feel like there is a shifting the point is I could have done it

38:42.600 --> 38:47.960
Uh-huh. So that's where I got myself into trouble is once I started fooling around with it. I should have been intimidated

38:48.240 --> 38:52.680
It's easy to do you can adjust the things you make a great look at website

38:52.680 --> 38:56.240
So just be clear the fault is not with Squarespace. It is with Justin

38:57.280 --> 39:02.060
And in our stars, yes, and I've built Squarespace websites before I guess

39:02.060 --> 39:04.560
I just had the yips because I wanted it to be really good

39:04.560 --> 39:09.480
Yeah, I mean I wanted to look great, but I should have trusted that Squarespace simplest would make everything look fantastic

39:09.480 --> 39:12.800
That is what they do. So as Michael from from

39:13.640 --> 39:15.640
Drunks and Dragons like help me

39:16.000 --> 39:21.520
Help me to build it. Yeah, and he did you need I could have done it on my own but I

39:21.520 --> 39:26.600
Appreciate do you understand? Yeah, sure. Sure. Sure. Like you could have done it, but you got scared

39:26.720 --> 39:29.440
Yeah, don't get me scared. Don't get me wrong in the ad copy

39:29.440 --> 39:32.440
It does want us to talk about how easy it is and that you could do it yourself

39:33.080 --> 39:39.480
I could have I should have trusted that is what I'm saying. But at the same time, I really appreciate Michael's help

39:40.800 --> 39:45.640
They offered 24-7 support but not 24-7 emotional support. Thank you

39:45.640 --> 39:52.240
Which is what Justin needed. They don't tell you that the magic is inside you. So Justin could have used Squarespace

39:52.240 --> 39:56.360
But he second-guessed himself and that's why he's here now to tell you don't make his mistakes

39:56.760 --> 40:01.060
Right you be better than Justin use Squarespace yourself, right?

40:01.060 --> 40:04.180
This is your chance to prove that you're a better person than Justin

40:04.200 --> 40:08.480
Make your own partner a website to run for West Virginia House of Delegates

40:08.480 --> 40:12.960
Go to mcroyforwv.com and you'll see this website built in Squarespace. You'll be like

40:12.960 --> 40:19.280
Fuck this professional. Yeah, I made an equally important website to celebrate my dog called buttercup is a very good girl calm

40:19.480 --> 40:24.440

40:42.400 --> 40:46.840
Justin is of doing the wrong thing then let door-dash do it for you

40:46.840 --> 40:51.060
I mean from now on all of my ad reads are gonna be about Justin being afraid

40:51.280 --> 40:56.080
Cuz I think I fear is a powerful motivational tool, but I don't want to make it about our listeners being afraid

40:56.280 --> 41:01.280
That's gonna use it about Justin sometimes Justin's afraid that he'll forget things at the store

41:01.280 --> 41:03.200
And then he's like, what am I gonna do now?

41:03.200 --> 41:08.580
Oh, whatever everyone finds out that I forgot the snacks and the drinks and the household essentials. Oh god

41:08.580 --> 41:11.080
They're all gonna be so mad at me. Well good news Justin

41:11.160 --> 41:15.400
You can use door-dash and they can have household essentials drinks and snacks delivered in

41:15.760 --> 41:22.160
As little as 30 minutes right to your door and Justin don't be afraid about not being able to connect with the restaurants

41:22.160 --> 41:28.240
You love door-dash. They can connect you with the restaurants you love so fear no more Justin and Justin Justin

Like a cozy mystery that doesn't have any blood or violence in it. Good news. That's a knife

41:50.480 --> 41:55.080
No, well, is that for Justin to wield or the door-dash deliverer to bring?

41:55.080 --> 41:59.040
I don't know that we should say that door-dash

41:59.160 --> 42:04.440
Delivers bring a huge knife to your door when they come to do they won't wield it. They won't have it in their hand

42:04.440 --> 42:09.600

Uninhabitable, but beneath the surface. Well, that's another story entirely

In a city built leagues below the apocalypse survivors of the storm forged paths through a strange new world

Some people say that the storm is the only way to survive

44:02.120 --> 44:09.120
Some seek salvation for their homeland above others seek to chart the vast undersea expanse outside the city's walls

He's so good a good turn on parks on a good turn. They had it's not wild though. They had Kamala Harris

45:30.680 --> 45:37.480
So it's like not why it's not wild. It's just that they're two individual human beings, right? Yeah. No, I know man

45:37.480 --> 45:38.480
I know

45:38.480 --> 45:45.400

It's just a half their name is a different name it's a one name in comma Thoreau and Trudeau is very similar

45:54.960 --> 46:00.640
I mean, yeah, you could rhyme it in a poem. Absolutely. Hey, let's do let's do another question. Maybe

46:01.240 --> 46:03.240
Yeah, sure

46:03.440 --> 46:07.080
Travis I cannot believe you put this next one in what I love listening to your show

However, awesome. Sometimes you fellows use large or unique words that I have to look up. I don't know the meaning irony

46:13.200 --> 46:17.320
I was telling myself. I'm gonna remember those cool words and use them when I can however

46:18.080 --> 46:23.520
I after I close my dictionary, I almost immediately forget those words and then fail to use them brothers

46:23.520 --> 46:26.720
How can I get a cool vocabulary like you? Yeah

46:27.280 --> 46:32.080
That's from vocabulary vexed in Vermont. Yeah, sometimes, you know, you know

46:32.080 --> 46:34.240
we're trying to do the show and you feel that truculence and

46:34.240 --> 46:38.320
You're like, oh, I don't remember and those words can be such a femora

46:40.840 --> 46:46.360
You can't actually do that twice per episode it's illegal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't want to be personally you guys are right mean

46:47.380 --> 46:52.080
What my recommendation would be to get a job where you have to talk about?

46:53.200 --> 46:54.960
Everything all the time

46:54.960 --> 47:00.840
yeah, and then eventually you get you start to hate the way that you say it and you think there must be a new way of

47:00.840 --> 47:07.600
Saying these things because I hate the way I do it. Yeah, and that's so you inspire yourself to get some some new vocabulary

47:08.560 --> 47:13.800
You know you look for opportunities to use in your day-to-day life. You don't even have to know what it means

47:13.960 --> 47:16.560
That's the beauty of it. If you say it with confidence

47:16.560 --> 47:18.560
We live in an ever-shifting

47:18.840 --> 47:24.320
Linguist society now and so sometimes you can just say a word with confidence and someone could be like, I don't think it means that

47:24.320 --> 47:30.060
You know like it does now actually because somebody used it on tick-tock and they can't disprove that. It's amazing

47:30.060 --> 47:32.960
Oh to be alive in the world today. Oh

47:33.880 --> 47:35.880
Nothing means anything

47:36.960 --> 47:44.280
You should change your life to use the word. So like if you learn a if you learn a new word like

47:46.320 --> 47:52.480
Can't even think of any word juice think of any word pal, come on you can do it I use so many early in the episode

47:53.760 --> 47:55.200
Come on

47:55.200 --> 47:57.200
verisimilitude

47:57.320 --> 47:59.320
from downtown I

47:59.320 --> 48:04.000
Thought it was versus millitude versus. No, that's when you fight millitude

48:06.800 --> 48:11.380
Then you should do things that were verisimilitude would be part of the

48:11.940 --> 48:16.960
You know like you should I know it cuz Richard Donner used it when he was talking about the Superman movie

48:16.960 --> 48:22.240
So like if you're making them really use their similitude like truth to be like

48:22.240 --> 48:30.120
I wanted to seek out verisimilitude in the Superman movies a movie about a man who flies backward around the planet. Um

48:31.800 --> 48:39.120
It's just it's it's here Travis, okay, you're gonna feel like a real horse's patoot when I send you my this is my Twitter banner

48:39.680 --> 48:41.680
Okay

48:41.840 --> 48:45.720
I'm not on I'm never on Twitter in slack. Okay. Okay. Oh

48:45.720 --> 48:52.280
Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's Superman the holding a banner says verisimilitude. Yeah. Okay, great

48:52.280 --> 48:59.880
It's so I'm saying like find a time in a place in the world where that concept would be important and shift your life to meet

48:59.880 --> 49:01.400
your vocabulary

49:01.400 --> 49:02.560
You know, I mean, yeah

49:02.560 --> 49:06.360
But sometimes also big words are like fucking overrated because like there's a word

49:06.920 --> 49:11.240
Pocritudinous means like very beautiful and like beauty and shit. That's an ugly sounding word. It's a gross word

49:11.240 --> 49:15.600
So who needs it just say bodacious way better way better

49:15.600 --> 49:19.760
I think we could you're not gonna say like check out that poker tune in his ass, right?

49:19.760 --> 49:22.800
You're not gonna say that but you know, I also wouldn't say check out that bodacious

49:22.800 --> 49:29.240
Who would I be you wouldn't say you wouldn't say check out that bodacious a but who would I be saying that to Travis in?

49:29.240 --> 49:33.200
My life. Well your son when he's older Griffin. Yeah, I forgot

49:34.320 --> 49:36.320
So important to build your kids up

49:37.640 --> 49:39.640
Sorry, I

49:39.640 --> 49:44.360
Was saying you would say it to have a bonding moment with your son about a bodacious ass

49:44.360 --> 49:49.920
Yeah, you saw we saw a babe a target. Yeah, and you want to talk about that bodacious ass

49:49.920 --> 49:55.280
Yeah, what you're saying is like he's ready for his first like homecoming dance and you're like sniffling

49:55.280 --> 49:57.280
Yeah, I'm just so proud of you

49:58.280 --> 50:00.360
He's like dad don't come on

50:00.360 --> 50:11.080
I'm gonna get me crying if I could say bodacious ass I love you

50:11.080 --> 50:14.880
I love you so much. Dad. I love your bodacious ass today

50:14.880 --> 50:19.400
I know that bodacious ass is the way you say I love you cuz you were raised in a different generation

50:19.400 --> 50:25.440
You're wildly uncomfortable and every time you come in my bodacious ass because you love me bodacious ass son

50:25.440 --> 50:27.440
But they just ask you to daddy

50:27.440 --> 50:29.440
I

50:30.600 --> 50:32.600
Interesting

50:34.600 --> 50:36.600
Yes

50:42.920 --> 50:44.560
Okay

50:44.560 --> 50:46.000
Little caesar's

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
not Batman related is

50:48.320 --> 50:53.780
A pizza restaurant where you can get things at a drive through and you drive up you say give me pizza, please

50:53.780 --> 51:04.340
Can I also just say real quick, Little Caesars is a great example of a restaurant where I have no idea where we're at culturally, as to have they turned their shit around, is it still viewed as like...

51:04.340 --> 51:09.540
It was the cheap pizza because you get two, and that's what we had at church all the time. It was always Little Caesars.

51:09.540 --> 51:10.900
I fucking love Little Caesars.

51:10.900 --> 51:12.100
But have they turned it around?

51:12.100 --> 51:12.660
It was the awesome Little Caesars.

51:12.660 --> 51:13.620
Because Domino's did a thing.

51:13.620 --> 51:27.620
Yeah, this is interesting. See, that was my supposition, right? When I would get Pizza Hut or Domino's, I would think, oh, I'm really treating myself now because I'm not eating, or God forbid, like a backyard pizza.

51:27.620 --> 51:29.300
Oh my God, who has the money?

51:29.860 --> 51:30.420
Who's got the money?

51:30.420 --> 51:31.460
In this economy?

51:32.020 --> 51:42.900
I thought, let the common folk have Little Caesars, but then I tried it recently. It's been maybe a decade. Great. Great quality food. I really enjoyed it.

51:42.900 --> 51:45.300
One of the best sausages in the game, frankly.

51:45.300 --> 51:48.980
One of a great sausage. Not like you're going to get over at Monty's Pizza.

51:48.980 --> 51:50.580
No, no, no, no. You get that crumble?

51:50.580 --> 51:51.700
On 7th Avenue, that kind of crumble.

51:51.700 --> 51:54.980
Oh, no, no, no. That's the shit. They cut the circle into squares. Love it.

51:54.980 --> 51:55.540
Oh, come on.

51:55.540 --> 51:59.780
Oh, forget about it. You throw some barbecue chips on there, you're living the dream.

51:59.780 --> 52:01.300
Oh, now you're snacking.

52:01.300 --> 52:01.860
Oh, boy, boy, boy.

52:01.860 --> 52:04.740
You guys are narrowcasting to the people on this show.

52:04.740 --> 52:05.460
Yeah.

52:06.020 --> 52:06.580
To each other.

52:06.580 --> 52:08.740
Sometimes I forget there's other people listening.

52:08.740 --> 52:15.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Little Caesars unveils a new superhero offering. The Batman Calzoni.

52:15.300 --> 52:16.260
It is Batman.

52:17.300 --> 52:18.020
Yeah, that's my-

52:18.580 --> 52:20.180
That's why you did the Batman theme?

52:20.180 --> 52:26.100
Yeah, but the Batman Calzoni. I saw a sign for this at the Little Caesars across from Fantastic Sam's over near the-

52:26.100 --> 52:27.220
Oh, yeah, I know that one.

52:27.220 --> 52:36.100
And I was like, I had to, I literally stopped my car to take a picture with my phone because I was like, what? It just said Batman Calzoni $7.99.

52:36.100 --> 52:41.220
Now, can I just say that one does not look like a calzone. Two-

52:41.220 --> 52:43.780
It's not a calzone, you idiot. It's Calzoni.

52:43.780 --> 52:46.260
It looks more like Mothman than Batman.

52:47.140 --> 52:52.740
Okay, well, like, maybe next time you make a half calzone, half pizza, you'll make it look more like Batman.

52:52.740 --> 52:57.860
I'm just saying that is not the shape of either the Batman or his symbol.

52:58.500 --> 52:59.780
That looks like the Bat symbol.

52:59.780 --> 53:06.180
It does not look like the Bat symbol. The Bat symbol is much more oblong. This is a pizza that someone fucked up.

53:06.180 --> 53:06.580
This is-

53:06.580 --> 53:08.260
Okay, so I can just talk about it for a second.

53:08.260 --> 53:08.820
Yeah, sure.

53:10.420 --> 53:17.460
It's the Batman Calzoni. The Bat signal has been spotted in Detroit, but not the way you'd expect.

53:19.700 --> 53:24.020
This is from MLive.com, which is a Michigan news source, I think.

53:24.740 --> 53:27.940
The Bat signal has been spotted in Detroit, but not in the way you'd expect.

53:27.940 --> 53:35.780
It comes courtesy of Little Caesars, which unveiled a super new food item on Monday, introducing the Batman Calzoni.

53:38.420 --> 53:39.780
It's a bat-shaped product.

53:39.780 --> 53:40.260
It's not.

53:40.260 --> 53:40.740
Hold on one sec.

53:41.940 --> 53:48.260
The bat-shaped product is a buttery-tasting calzone crust filled with garlic white sauce,

53:48.260 --> 53:55.780
cheese, and julienned pepperoni combined with a pepperoni pizza

53:55.780 --> 53:58.900
and served with a side of crazy sauce.

53:58.900 --> 54:02.020
I'm staring at this, and the picture you have sent us, Justin,

54:02.020 --> 54:06.180
the pepperoni are arranged in such a way that it feels like a magic eye poster,

54:06.180 --> 54:09.780
and I'm transfixed by it, and I'm trying to find-

54:09.780 --> 54:10.820
But they're perfect.

54:10.820 --> 54:13.300
They are geometrically sort of aligned.

54:13.300 --> 54:16.740
Yeah, I think they knew they were going to take a picture of this one, so they made it look good.

54:16.740 --> 54:19.220
Because it's also really shiny and red.

54:20.180 --> 54:21.300
It's $7.99.

54:21.300 --> 54:26.180
That's a good price. And it says it's going to be available for a limited time, starting on Monday.

54:26.180 --> 54:30.260
Now, normally that would stress me out, but in this case, I think that's probably good,

54:30.260 --> 54:33.140
because I would hate to go into Little Caesars four years from now,

54:33.140 --> 54:37.300
and I'm like, why do you guys have something called a Batman Calzoni?

54:37.300 --> 54:40.260
They'd have to look at me dead in the eye and be like, I absolutely have no idea.

54:40.260 --> 54:40.660
Well, you say that.

54:40.660 --> 54:43.780
We just always had a Batman Calzoni, so we just always have it.

54:43.780 --> 54:46.420
What about Superman ice cream and Baskin Robbins?

54:46.420 --> 54:47.140
That's different.

54:47.140 --> 54:47.700
That's different.

54:47.700 --> 54:48.340
It's different.

54:48.340 --> 54:49.060
Okay, all right.

54:49.060 --> 54:50.420
It makes so much more sense.

54:50.420 --> 54:56.900
Anyone can now bring superhero vibes to pizza night by trying the new Batman Calzoni,

54:56.900 --> 55:00.340
said Jeff Klein, chief marketing officer at Little Caesars.

55:00.340 --> 55:04.740
It's the most delicious part of our partnership with the upcoming film, The Batman.

55:04.740 --> 55:05.940
What are the other delicious parts?

55:05.940 --> 55:07.300
What's the least delicious part?

55:07.300 --> 55:08.180
What else you got?

55:08.180 --> 55:09.220
Yeah, what's the least?

55:09.220 --> 55:09.940
Probably all the fucking-

55:09.940 --> 55:13.860
And try the Batman sweat soda that tastes just like the inside of his cowl

55:13.860 --> 55:15.620
after a hard night's butcher roll.

55:15.620 --> 55:19.060
It's fucking gross, but Pattinson insisted.

55:19.060 --> 55:21.380
Try the Riddler press freeze.

55:24.820 --> 55:27.620
The only question you'll have is, why did I get this?

55:28.420 --> 55:32.580
The Batman, which will feature the Cape Crusader uncovering corruption in Gotham City

55:32.580 --> 55:37.140
that connects to his own family while facing a serial killer known as the Riddler-

55:37.140 --> 55:37.700
The Riddler?

55:37.700 --> 55:38.340
I've heard of this.

55:38.340 --> 55:38.660
What?

55:39.620 --> 55:44.180
A serial killer known as the Riddler will be released on March 4th.

55:44.180 --> 55:46.100
What's happening with this crime wave?

55:46.100 --> 55:48.900
There's a serial killer named the Riddler.

55:48.900 --> 55:52.020
Did we name him that or did he name himself Unclear?

55:52.020 --> 55:54.580
Do you guys think if you get killed by the Ridd-

55:54.580 --> 55:56.180
If you live in Gotham City-

55:56.180 --> 55:56.420
Yeah.

55:56.420 --> 55:58.820
And then there's like an explosion and you're like,

55:58.820 --> 56:02.100
oh shit, it's a Batman level crime that's happening.

56:02.100 --> 56:04.420
And then the Riddler comes out and kills you.

56:04.420 --> 56:06.420
You're like, fucking fuck.

56:06.420 --> 56:08.820
The Riddles guy is killing me?

56:08.820 --> 56:11.300
Couldn't even be like the Penguin or somebody?

56:11.300 --> 56:18.740
That's got to be a really stressful thing about being Batman is when you are fighting the Riddler,

56:18.740 --> 56:20.900
you're like, please don't let me die fighting the Riddler.

56:20.900 --> 56:22.580
Yeah, he can't be like this, right?

56:22.580 --> 56:23.060
Please.

56:23.060 --> 56:24.020
Who killed Batman?

56:24.020 --> 56:24.900
Who finally killed Batman?

56:24.900 --> 56:25.460
Who got him?

56:25.460 --> 56:26.020
Bane.

56:26.020 --> 56:27.220
Oh, okay.

56:27.220 --> 56:28.260
That actually makes sense.

56:28.260 --> 56:31.140
I thought you were going to say the Riddler and I was going to be like, what'd he do?

56:31.140 --> 56:33.380
Riddle him to death?

56:33.380 --> 56:34.020
Yeah.

56:34.020 --> 56:36.500
He riddled him with bullets and he laughed the whole time.

56:36.500 --> 56:39.300
But then we were like, that's not anything.

56:39.300 --> 56:41.300
That's not how the name-

56:41.300 --> 56:45.300
I'm so excited that I get to watch Paul Dano fight-

56:46.900 --> 56:47.780
Robert Pattinson.

56:47.780 --> 56:49.380
My dear friend, Robert Pattinson.

56:50.260 --> 56:52.180
Who will win that fight?

56:52.180 --> 56:53.300
I have an answer.

56:53.300 --> 56:53.780
Me.

56:53.780 --> 56:58.420
I'm just glad that we're finally, finally bringing the Batman to the big screen.

56:59.060 --> 56:59.540
Yeah.

56:59.540 --> 57:01.380
Let his story be told.

57:01.380 --> 57:03.060
How did he get where he is?

57:03.060 --> 57:04.500
What's his whole deal?

57:04.500 --> 57:07.380
Does he have some sort of butler man who helps him?

57:07.380 --> 57:09.300
I don't know these things.

57:09.300 --> 57:10.980
Are his parents cool?

57:10.980 --> 57:11.620
Are they cool?

57:11.620 --> 57:12.340
What do they do?

57:13.140 --> 57:13.620
Right?

57:13.620 --> 57:16.340
Does he connect with other human beings in an easy way?

57:16.900 --> 57:17.380
Right?

57:17.380 --> 57:19.860
Is he cool in social situations?

57:19.860 --> 57:22.660
Is he at all haunted by some sort of dark past?

57:22.660 --> 57:23.700
I don't know.

57:23.700 --> 57:25.540
What's his financials like?

57:25.540 --> 57:25.780
Yeah.

57:25.780 --> 57:26.580
Where's he at?

57:26.580 --> 57:28.980
Is he barely getting by?

57:28.980 --> 57:30.020
Finding his free time?

57:30.020 --> 57:32.580
He's going to fight some villains, but also got to pay the bills.

57:33.220 --> 57:34.260
I don't know.

57:34.260 --> 57:34.660
I don't know.

57:34.660 --> 57:38.580
Now, it is worth noting that we're having a lot of fun here.

57:38.580 --> 57:46.500
But of course, any permutation of Batman that comes up maybe in podcasts or whatever is great.

57:46.500 --> 57:50.100
We're just more Batman stories the better out there.

57:50.100 --> 57:50.420
Thank you.

57:50.420 --> 57:51.460
Yeah, we do love that.

57:52.580 --> 57:53.380
But here's the thing.

57:53.380 --> 57:56.100
Audio Batman, that's where it's at, man.

57:56.100 --> 57:56.420
That's where it's at.

57:56.420 --> 57:58.420
Let me picture my own Batman.

57:59.140 --> 58:02.340
And he's got, oh, he's got long curly blonde hair.

58:02.340 --> 58:04.020
Hey guys, what's your perfect Batman?

58:04.020 --> 58:07.380
This calzone does look like a minstrel pad, though.

58:07.380 --> 58:10.660
And I don't know what they were thinking when they did it.

58:10.660 --> 58:11.380
It's got wings.

58:13.300 --> 58:15.860
Guys, I think I've, can I tell you something?

58:15.860 --> 58:17.140
I had had a pause earlier.

58:17.140 --> 58:20.660
I'm sure Rachel edited it out, but I had to pause earlier because I had a wave of nausea.

58:20.660 --> 58:24.180
And I think that that was caused by the incredible hunger

58:24.180 --> 58:26.020
that I feel looking at this incredible calzone.

58:26.020 --> 58:28.260
You look at this and this makes you hungry.

58:28.260 --> 58:30.020
I want nothing more than to eat this.

58:30.020 --> 58:31.060
I would ravish this.

58:31.060 --> 58:32.100
I find, can I tell you-

58:32.100 --> 58:32.980
Unspeakable.

58:32.980 --> 58:36.420
I find the symmetry of the pepperoni very off-putting.

58:37.940 --> 58:38.260
Why?

58:38.260 --> 58:38.820
Because I know-

58:38.820 --> 58:39.380
It looks fantastic.

58:39.380 --> 58:41.620
I know a human being touched this a lot.

58:42.260 --> 58:43.220
Yeah, that's a good point.

58:43.220 --> 58:46.420
This isn't somebody threw down a scattering of pepperonis.

58:46.420 --> 58:49.380
This took somebody several minutes to-

58:49.380 --> 58:53.060
A human being individually touched each of these ronis.

58:53.060 --> 58:53.300
Yeah.

58:54.900 --> 59:00.660
Why on earth do you assume that the calzone that you would buy at the Little Caesars for $7.99

59:00.660 --> 59:04.580
available without pre-order Monday through Friday from 4 to 8 p.m.?

59:04.580 --> 59:07.380
What on earth makes you think it would look anything like this?

59:07.380 --> 59:12.820
No, I know that, Justin, but I can believe that that is a naturally occurring Batman calzone.

59:12.820 --> 59:14.740
Or I look at this and I say, this is man-made.

59:15.300 --> 59:15.860
This is a man-made.

59:15.860 --> 59:18.100
God, I'm so hungry for this calzone.

59:18.100 --> 59:20.100
I think that means it's time to stop the show.

59:20.820 --> 59:22.500
Yeah, yeah, it's calzone time.

59:22.500 --> 59:24.180
Thanks so much for listening to our podcast.

59:25.780 --> 59:27.220
Oh boy, where to start?

59:27.220 --> 59:28.500
Let's start by-

59:28.500 --> 59:32.580
Again, we fucked up last week by not telling you all about this great virtual live show

59:32.580 --> 59:33.540
we have coming up on the 26th.

59:33.540 --> 59:34.820
Please come.

59:34.820 --> 59:36.020
Man, don't be so mad.

59:37.380 --> 59:38.980
Nobody's bought tickets to it.

59:38.980 --> 59:40.340
We kind of messed up, okay?

59:40.340 --> 59:41.620
It's at 9 p.m. Eastern time.

59:41.620 --> 59:44.740
You can get tickets at bit.ly slash mabim-bam virtual.

59:45.540 --> 59:46.180
It's Friday.

59:46.180 --> 59:47.140
It's this Friday.

59:47.140 --> 59:48.580
This Friday, so come on out.

59:48.580 --> 59:49.460
This Saturday.

59:49.460 --> 59:52.580
This Saturday, so come have a good time this Saturday with us.

59:54.180 --> 59:56.340
It's weekend fun time with your-

59:56.340 --> 59:59.220
Hey, but listen, can you just sound a little like it?

59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.260
You're selling people on taking in more of you.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.980
Can you just sound like you're not completely miserable?

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:06.820
I mean, I got-

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.260
Like you're excited to do it.

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:10.260
I mean, I got some personal stuff going on,

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.820
but I guess if you need me to amp up the volume a little bit-

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:15.380
If you could turn it up and turn it on and turn it loose.

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:15.780
Yeah, sure.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.620
What's up, sickos?

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.180
Saturday, baby.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:23.460
Bit.ly slash mabim-bam virtual, you fucking freaks.

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:26.340
Yep, there it is.

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:32.740
Oh, that's great.

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.180
Our dad wrote a kid's book.

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.420
It's called Goldie's Guide to Grandchilding.

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:42.660
And if you go to L-I-N-K-T-R dot E-E,

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:47.140
that's Linktree with a dot before the two E's slash Goldie's Guide.

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:50.020
G-O-L-D-I-E-S guide.

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:55.380
You can see some events that he's doing to promote that book,

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:58.020
and you can go pre-order the book and you should do it.

01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.700
It's gonna be so cute.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:01.540
And our dad wrote a book, and we're really proud of him.

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.260
So go get his book and go to his book events.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:04.740
I love you, dad.

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:08.340
But just when you thought the best had passed,

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:12.900
we went and saved the best for last because we are doing it.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.260
The 20 Rendezvous Fancy Takes Flight Tour.

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:19.380
Tickets on sale this Friday, February 25th,

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:21.540
at noon local time.

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:25.300
Big.ly slash McElroy Tours for ticket links and more info.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.900
And listen, yes, masks and proof of full vaccination

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:33.860
or negative COVID test within 72 hours of event are required.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.700
One more time, you gotta wear a mask

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.340
and you gotta show proof of full vaccination

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:41.700
or negative COVID test within 72 hours of the event.

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.460
But we're coming to your city, maybe.

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.860
We're coming live in our own flesh.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:48.740
Yeah, we'll be there.

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:49.700
For real this time.

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.940
Our beautiful human flesh.

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:52.340
I will be there.

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:55.620
We've threatened it a few times, but now we're serious.

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:56.740
This time for real.

01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:01.700
I do need to say, I will have a sort of proxy homunculus guy.

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.700
But it will look just like Griffin.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.100
Except under his indistinguishable-

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.300
He's very small.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.060
Except it can't pronounce Ks.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:09.620
Yeah.

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:12.340
So that's the only sort of problem with it.

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:13.940
But other than that, it's just like Griffin.

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:14.660
It's just like Griffin.

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:16.020
And he's about six inches tall.

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:18.020
He's not really, whoa, he's bigger?

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:18.500
Yeah.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.060
Yeah.

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.340
And a little more mostly.

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:21.540
Oh, okay.

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.060
He's better than Griffin in every way,

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:24.900
except he can't pronounce the letter K.

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.220
Other than that though, one more time, tickets on sale.

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.460
Can you tell him to think C and just say a hard C?

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:32.980
Do a hard C or like a CH if that helps.

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:35.300
His mouth doesn't, just can't.

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:36.340
He won't do it.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:36.580
Yeah.

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.140
We'll get there.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:41.940
Tickets on sale this Friday, February 25th at noon local time,

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:44.100
bit.ly slash McElroy Tours.

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.340
So you're gonna do that and do the live show

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:49.300
and get dad's book and go to McElroyMerch.com.

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.420
We got a new Besties tiebreaker coin

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:56.100
featuring New York Giraffe, the one and only.

01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:59.380
So that is at McElroyMerch.com.

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:00.580
We got the pin of the month.

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.740
We got the 20 rendezvous pins and we've got the

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:04.900
I'm Not Ashamed of My Clown Husband sticker.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.500
It's all there.

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:08.580
Go, fly you fools.

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:09.700
Go, be free.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.460
Thanks to Montaigne for these for a theme song.

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:12.660
My life is better with you.

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:15.860
It's a track that bumps in the night.

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.620
Yeah, bumps and humps and jumps.

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:19.220
Okay.

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:22.180
And I think that's the end of the show.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:22.980
I'm on Twitch.

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:24.820
Yep.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:25.140
Okay.

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.260
And Travis will just say that.

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.060
I'm on Twitch.

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:28.420
That's our new wrap up.

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:29.300
Where does that stop?

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:30.100
Where does that stop?

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:30.740
I wonder.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.860
Oh, it sounds like twitch.tv slash the Travis McElroy.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.260
Right, right, right.

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.420
But when will you have achieved enough Twitch success

01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.860
that it doesn't become-

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.980
When I'm up there with some of the greats

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:45.620
like Twitch Johnson and Twitch Jenkins and Twitch Johnson.

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:47.220
When I'm up in that echelon.

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.300
Twitch and Terry Peters.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:49.460
Yeah.

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:52.740
When I'm up there, I think that'll be the movie

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.220
starring Will Smith, Twitch.

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.180
When I'm in that realm, I think that's probably

01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:01.060
where I'll be able to take a year off, I think,

01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:02.020
so I can come back hot.

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:04.740
Griffin, I was thinking maybe you could try to like,

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.100
instead of the yahoos, which I love,

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:07.300
maybe you could try to like-

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.580
Just tell a joke.

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:10.660
You could just like workshop a new Closer every week.

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:11.380
Oh, that's good.

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.100
Until you find something that lands.

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:15.060
Like a new bit that feels like a new little mini bit.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.020
Like a sign.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.780
I think that's like undeniably Griffin.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:19.540
And can I be honest with everybody now?

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:23.380
I've been making them up.

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:23.700
What?

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:25.460
My life.

01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.060
Sorry, that's not the butt I meant.

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:27.380
Oh yeah.

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:28.900
No, no, no, it's not that.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:29.140
Okay.

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:31.060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, sorry.

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:31.460
Let me just-

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:32.020
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:32.260
Sorry.

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:34.900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:35.940
It's the same way.

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:37.540
Oh, that got me good.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.740
No, no, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:40.820
No, no, no, no, you need to really practice this

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:41.540
before you do it.

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:45.300
No, here, okay, say it again, say it again, say it again.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:46.100
I'll just say it again.

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:48.500
I've been making them up.

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:55.700
This is a MBMBAM exclusive.

01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:58.100
I mean, it's not something we should joke about.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:06.020
I've been effectively lying this whole time.

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:08.020
Does your wife Rachel know?

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:11.380
She's the one that put me up to it.

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:14.580
Did it get quieter?

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:16.500
That was a lesser reveal.

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.100
Yeah, it wasn't as big as the other ones.

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:19.300
Yeah.

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.980
Well, that'll be the bit for this week.

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.420
That's what we did this week.

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:27.060
It'll be different next week, so you never know what you're gonna get.

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:28.020
There's no familiarity.

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:30.900
Do you want me to send you a list of words you can use to help apologize?

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.100
I want nothing less.

My name is Justin McRoy.

I'm Griffin McRoy.

01:05:38.740 --> 01:06:06.260
