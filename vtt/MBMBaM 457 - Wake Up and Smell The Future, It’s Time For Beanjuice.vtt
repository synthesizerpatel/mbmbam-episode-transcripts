00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.680
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show from the modern

00:47.680 --> 00:52.480
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.480 --> 00:56.160
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.160 --> 01:01.520
And boy, it's an exciting day. The tingles on this end are just, it's electric.

01:01.520 --> 01:06.240
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel for the first time.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.480
Yeah, it's like I'm sitting on a bumblebee.

01:08.480 --> 01:14.400
So off mic, we had a conversation, it's been going for months now, that it seems like there's

01:14.400 --> 01:19.920
a trend in celebrities like throwing their weight and like all their investment and money and stuff

01:19.920 --> 01:26.240
behind a brand. You know, you have like Kanye West and like his line of clothes and shoes and stuff,

01:26.240 --> 01:32.880
and like Kim K, she's got a lot of money tied up in things. There's Goop, whatever that is.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.160
No one's quite sure what it is.

01:34.160 --> 01:39.280
No one knows what that is. And so we've been looking for what's our product.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.880
I mean, let's do like a bit of a reveal, right? Like let's put a little bit of that apple stink

01:44.880 --> 01:55.840
on it. So folks, close your eyes. And we're going to start saying some words and we want

01:55.840 --> 01:59.760
you to start thinking about the void in your life that these words could fill.

01:59.760 --> 02:01.680
I'll start with high end.

02:02.880 --> 02:03.600
Luxury.

02:04.240 --> 02:04.740
Youth.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.360
Morning time.

02:07.360 --> 02:07.860
Hot.

02:07.860 --> 02:14.500
What? Wake up. Wake up. Oh, wake up and smell the future.

02:15.140 --> 02:16.980
Grind up the day.

02:17.780 --> 02:21.780
Grind up the day with, can we say it at the same time or?

02:22.420 --> 02:25.220
I don't know if Skype will allow for that, but we'll see.

02:25.220 --> 02:28.100
Let's just start whispering it over and over again.

02:30.260 --> 02:34.660
Bean juice. Bean juice. Bean juice. Bean juice.

02:34.660 --> 02:38.500
I'm just now realizing when we say it that, hold on, I'll edit this out because we got

02:38.500 --> 02:44.580
to really, we can't like fuck this up because we have just, I have so much money invested

02:44.580 --> 02:49.780
in this, but I just realized that when you say bean juice a lot in a row, it does sound

02:49.780 --> 02:53.220
a lot like Beetlejuice and I don't want to scare the people.

02:53.220 --> 02:54.820
Bean juice.

02:54.820 --> 02:56.660
Hey Griffin, you're still cutting this out, right?

02:56.660 --> 02:57.700
Yes, yes, yes.

02:57.700 --> 03:01.060
Okay, good. As long as you're still editing because I'm so fucking scared about this.

03:01.060 --> 03:01.380
I know.

03:01.380 --> 03:08.100
It seemed like a really good idea, but like, bean juice, saying it is tough, right?

03:08.100 --> 03:08.340
Yeah.

03:08.340 --> 03:09.940
Okay, now back to the pitch, back to the pitch.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.540
All right, hold on, let me do some claps.

03:12.500 --> 03:15.220
Bean juice. Bean juice.

03:15.220 --> 03:19.780
Oh, what is it? Oh, you're probably sitting there thinking like, is it, I don't know,

03:19.780 --> 03:22.180
that you know when you open a can of beans and there's some juice?

03:22.180 --> 03:23.380
No, it's not that.

03:23.380 --> 03:23.860
What is that?

03:23.860 --> 03:26.420
Can we stop that? I'll edit this out again.

03:26.420 --> 03:34.100
That's kind of where I go and again, it's not super good or appetizing.

03:34.100 --> 03:38.100
I don't want to drink that because that is, when I Googled bean juice,

03:38.100 --> 03:41.700
that is like the first result and I don't know how we're going to beat that.

03:41.700 --> 03:45.060
Griffin, we talked about this, we have to be fucking committed or nobody's going to buy it.

03:45.060 --> 03:45.700
Okay, you're right.

03:45.700 --> 03:48.340
Cut back, cut back, put it, clap it in.

03:48.340 --> 03:51.300
No, it's not the juice from a bean can. Who would think of that?

03:52.180 --> 03:54.420
You might think, is it like coffee?

03:55.220 --> 03:55.860
And yes.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.060
And yeah, yeah.

03:57.060 --> 04:00.660
You got it in too. It is a, well, not a coffee.

04:00.660 --> 04:02.260
Griffin, can you edit this out?

04:02.260 --> 04:02.900
Yeah.

04:02.900 --> 04:06.660
Okay, I think maybe it does sound like it should have been coffee.

04:06.660 --> 04:10.020
We should be doing coffee and not just a coffee mug.

04:10.020 --> 04:14.500
Because if we just say that, is there any way we can get ahead of this and do just

04:14.500 --> 04:18.820
more than a coffee mug because I feel like then it's going to be very transparent.

04:18.820 --> 04:22.260
Right, it's going to be very transparent that we paid for all these mugs that say bean juice on

04:22.260 --> 04:25.300
them and then we try to justify it by then retro-

04:25.300 --> 04:27.620
Oh wait, okay, wait, edit, edit, edit me back in.

04:27.620 --> 04:28.180
Are you ready?

04:29.380 --> 04:31.220
No, everybody's got coffee.

04:31.220 --> 04:33.700
But the question is, where do you put it?

04:33.700 --> 04:38.500
In that old gross mug that you've had since like high school that's all gross?

04:38.500 --> 04:41.460
No, in our high-end VIP mug.

04:42.020 --> 04:43.300
It's revolutionary.

04:43.300 --> 04:47.460
How are you going to know where to pour this luxury brown sauce?

04:47.460 --> 04:51.780
This high, this high-end, hot, this hot bean juice.

04:51.780 --> 04:52.980
This hot bean juice.

04:52.980 --> 04:55.860
Wait, we're not selling the hot bean juice part.

04:55.860 --> 04:56.580
No, no, no, no, no.

04:56.580 --> 04:57.140
Okay.

04:57.140 --> 05:01.540
But like, where do you even know where to and how to put it?

05:02.740 --> 05:04.180
Here's a mug that tells you.

05:04.820 --> 05:06.980
It's made of ceramic or something.

05:06.980 --> 05:09.540
We didn't sign off on that or any part of the design.

05:09.540 --> 05:12.740
There's a design on it that says bean juice.

05:13.460 --> 05:15.300
And it's one word modern.

05:15.300 --> 05:18.020
And you can find it today.

05:18.020 --> 05:22.100
And can I cut the, can we, can I cut it?

05:22.100 --> 05:37.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:37.140 --> 05:37.860
I don't know, guys.

05:37.860 --> 05:38.260
I don't know.

05:39.300 --> 05:42.020
We probably should, we should make it sound like there's only a couple

05:42.020 --> 05:44.260
instead of like the tens of thousands.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.020
They're going to see right the fuck through that.

05:46.020 --> 05:47.380
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.420
Yes, yes.

05:48.420 --> 05:49.940
And we can do it like a contest.

05:49.940 --> 05:53.460
Okay, cut it back in, cut it back in.

05:53.460 --> 05:56.740
So we have a contest to announce alongside.

05:56.740 --> 06:00.260
And it's that one, there's two cups.

06:00.260 --> 06:04.980
There's only two mugs and to get them, you have to give us 100.

06:04.980 --> 06:07.140
How much did we, how much?

06:07.140 --> 06:08.740
Okay, 100 is too much.

06:08.740 --> 06:09.780
Justin, what was our overhead?

06:09.780 --> 06:10.500
Oh, per cup?

06:10.500 --> 06:11.860
It's a pay what you can.

06:11.860 --> 06:14.180
Is that, that was bad for a mug, right?

06:14.180 --> 06:14.740
Yeah, that's no good.

06:14.740 --> 06:16.180
Because there are fixed costs.

06:16.180 --> 06:21.300
This is a great opportunity for you to enter a contest where you could win one of two coffee cups.

06:21.300 --> 06:22.580
By buying them.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.100
And shit, I said coffee cups.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.780
We said this mug is sexier.

06:25.780 --> 06:27.060
And it can be anything.

06:27.060 --> 06:28.020
And it's bean juice.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.460
You have to say bean juice mug, Griffin.

06:29.460 --> 06:30.420
You can't say coffee.

06:30.420 --> 06:35.700
We can also just say like that it's these, what makes a bean juice mug different?

06:35.700 --> 06:36.980
It makes the coffee taste better.

06:36.980 --> 06:39.540
And also you can't break it no matter how hard you try.

06:40.580 --> 06:43.780
And if you do break it, we will replace it.

06:43.780 --> 06:44.580
Oh, okay.

06:44.580 --> 06:48.020
We will replace it at the exact additional cost.

06:48.020 --> 06:50.580
Shit, that's not, none of that, that doesn't work.

06:51.140 --> 06:52.340
That doesn't, that doesn't work.

06:52.340 --> 06:53.620
No, for the same cost, well.

06:53.620 --> 06:54.980
Please buy mugs.

06:54.980 --> 06:55.780
Please just buy mugs.

06:55.780 --> 06:56.740
Please, okay, listen.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.540
We have four kids at this point between the three of us.

07:01.540 --> 07:03.940
And we put all of their college funds into bean juice.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.860
It's all our brains on this, guys.

07:05.860 --> 07:08.260
We just, we thought maybe bean juice.

07:09.380 --> 07:12.580
I just got a fucking whole pallet of these fucking mugs, guys.

07:12.580 --> 07:14.020
I don't even know where I keep them.

07:14.020 --> 07:16.180
Rachel's gonna be so fucking TO'd.

07:17.620 --> 07:19.220
Guys, real quick, we forgot to,

07:20.020 --> 07:22.820
we forgot to get a URL for the mugs.

07:22.820 --> 07:24.660
Where should I put, what should I get?

07:24.660 --> 07:26.340
Beanjuice.xxx?

07:26.340 --> 07:27.940
I can't get beanjuice.com.

07:27.940 --> 07:28.820
I can't get beanjuice.xxx.

07:28.820 --> 07:29.620
Oh, no.

07:29.620 --> 07:30.120
Oh, no.

07:30.980 --> 07:31.780
That's so bad.

07:31.780 --> 07:32.980
That's so bad.

07:32.980 --> 07:34.260
Beanjuice Brothers?

07:34.260 --> 07:36.740
Beanjuice Brothers is so much more to type.

07:36.740 --> 07:39.300
I can get beanjuice.horse, that's nothing.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.740
What about Brother Juice?

07:40.740 --> 07:41.460
I get a no.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.700
I get an IP address.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.940
No, our lawyer who sits in the corner

07:45.940 --> 07:48.100
when we record is looking at me shaking his head.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.140
I typed in, whoa, I can get brotherjuice.com,

07:51.140 --> 07:53.380
which I may just pick up as long as I'm shopping.

07:53.380 --> 07:54.660
Just think you have it.

07:54.660 --> 07:56.980
Just as like an impulse buy by the register.

07:56.980 --> 07:59.940
I'm just gonna add that to the cart real quick.

07:59.940 --> 08:05.380
How about beanjuicemugsforsale.com?

08:05.380 --> 08:05.860
Perfect.

08:06.420 --> 08:07.460
That works for me.

08:07.460 --> 08:08.820
I like how brief it is.

08:08.820 --> 08:10.340
Number four or spelled out?

08:10.340 --> 08:13.860
Beanjuice Mugs, the number four seems easy.

08:13.860 --> 08:14.740
That's quicker to type.

08:14.740 --> 08:15.540
Shorter, yeah.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.940
So you can just try that link.

08:17.940 --> 08:19.300
It'll take you right to the mugs.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.180
It's a new brand.

08:20.820 --> 08:22.340
A new, oh, fuck.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.500
What's our first question?

08:24.500 --> 08:25.700
Here's my first question.

08:25.700 --> 08:26.420
What did we do?

08:27.060 --> 08:28.980
My wife thinks I'm bad at napkins.

08:28.980 --> 08:31.460
She claims this because whenever I go out to eat

08:31.460 --> 08:34.180
at a place where you have to get your own napkins, I do not.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.740
The reason I don't is because someone always gets napkins

08:36.740 --> 08:38.740
and they inevitably grab more than they need.

08:38.740 --> 08:41.940
Then I swoop the unused napkins as needed and life goes on.

08:41.940 --> 08:43.860
She maintains this is rude behavior.

08:43.860 --> 08:45.860
I maintain it is napkin efficient.

08:45.860 --> 08:46.980
Who is right in this?

08:46.980 --> 08:48.340
And that's from nipping napkins.

08:49.060 --> 08:51.460
Wow, that's actually, hmm.

08:51.460 --> 08:52.260
This is a good one.

08:52.260 --> 08:52.900
This is a good one.

08:53.620 --> 08:57.460
I never, I never grab napkins.

08:57.460 --> 08:59.300
I'm just sitting here thinking about that,

08:59.300 --> 09:00.820
unless I'm dining alone.

09:00.820 --> 09:04.020
I never grab napkins because I assume my wife got napkins.

09:04.020 --> 09:05.060
I am the opposite.

09:05.060 --> 09:08.900
Where I, when said like get however many,

09:08.900 --> 09:10.820
I don't know, ketchup packets or straws

09:10.820 --> 09:12.900
or napkins you need on your own.

09:12.900 --> 09:16.980
I suddenly am just like, I have no concept.

09:16.980 --> 09:18.980
Like I'll get three straws for one drink.

09:18.980 --> 09:20.980
And now inevitably it does always pan out

09:20.980 --> 09:23.940
because someone at the table didn't grab straws.

09:23.940 --> 09:27.300
And it does, it is, someone has to be the grasshopper

09:27.300 --> 09:28.660
and someone has to be the aunt.

09:28.660 --> 09:29.620
That's just it.

09:29.620 --> 09:31.780
I feel like without your services,

09:31.780 --> 09:33.380
there's gonna be a lot of napkins

09:33.380 --> 09:36.500
just getting thrown in the Fazzoli's garbage can.

09:37.220 --> 09:40.980
The world needs big, beautiful napkin boats,

09:40.980 --> 09:43.620
but it needs those napkin barnacles too.

09:43.620 --> 09:44.820
Feeding off the underbelly

09:44.820 --> 09:47.380
of the more responsible clean-handed parties among us.

09:47.940 --> 09:51.940
Because I'm with you and Rachel always does.

09:51.940 --> 09:54.100
And then it's a zero-sum game.

09:55.060 --> 09:55.780
You know what?

09:55.780 --> 09:59.060
I would say, I like when I grab ketchup packets

09:59.060 --> 10:01.140
and it's like, oh no, too many ketchup packets.

10:01.140 --> 10:03.860
They're still in individual containers that I take with me.

10:03.860 --> 10:05.940
Maybe from now on, if I get too many napkins,

10:05.940 --> 10:07.780
I just take those napkins with me

10:07.780 --> 10:09.140
and I use them again later.

10:09.140 --> 10:10.260
Those are some free napkins.

10:10.260 --> 10:11.940
This is a life hack from me to you.

10:11.940 --> 10:13.780
Don't wanna buy your own napkins for home?

10:14.340 --> 10:15.780
Good news, go to Fazzoli's.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.300
Get some napkins from Fazzoli's.

10:18.180 --> 10:18.820
They got you.

10:18.820 --> 10:19.700
They got you.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.620
They say take as many as you want.

10:21.620 --> 10:23.300
Just take the whole container.

10:23.300 --> 10:24.180
Can I talk about it?

10:24.180 --> 10:26.660
This has led me to a serious situation

10:26.660 --> 10:29.620
regarding Panera Bread that I wanted to hit you guys with.

10:29.620 --> 10:32.180
This is a big problem for me and I wanna talk you guys through it.

10:33.060 --> 10:34.900
I go to Panera Bread at the mall, right?

10:34.900 --> 10:35.700
You know the one.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.300
You know the Panera Bread up there.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.140
Justin's Place, I call it.

10:39.140 --> 10:39.940
Justin's Place.

10:40.740 --> 10:47.140
So two times ago, time before last, I went into Panera Bread.

10:47.140 --> 10:50.580
Go in with my family, my family.

10:50.580 --> 10:52.020
We walk into Panera Bread.

10:52.020 --> 10:53.700
We are in the back of the line.

10:53.700 --> 10:57.060
At this point, a gentleman walks up to us

10:57.060 --> 11:00.180
and asks where we'd like to sit at Panera Bread.

11:01.220 --> 11:03.860
And then asks if we'll need a high chair

11:03.860 --> 11:06.900
and says he'll find a spot for us and put a high chair there.

11:08.820 --> 11:11.300
That's problem one because I would like to pick

11:11.300 --> 11:12.980
where I'm going to sit at Panera Bread.

11:12.980 --> 11:14.100
You have taken that from me.

11:14.100 --> 11:17.380
You've taken my agency and this is extremely problematic.

11:17.380 --> 11:20.260
I've also never encountered a host at Panera Bread.

11:21.300 --> 11:23.540
Second, yes, exactly Travis.

11:23.540 --> 11:27.300
Second thing that comes is I go up and order my food.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.060
I go back to the table with my pager

11:29.060 --> 11:33.140
that's supposed to buzz when my salad

11:33.140 --> 11:36.340
and my family's food, which is two grilled cheese sandwiches

11:36.340 --> 11:38.580
for my daughters and a salad for my wife.

11:38.580 --> 11:41.300
When the food is done, I'm to be buzzed.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.180
This same gentleman who we'll call Dave

11:44.980 --> 11:48.900
rolls up to the table and takes my pager away from me

11:49.700 --> 11:52.500
and says he'll let me know when it's ready.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.540
Huh, huh, Justin.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.540
Right, huh, huh.

11:57.540 --> 12:02.820
And then I'm like, okay, well this sucks.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.220
He brings the food back,

12:05.220 --> 12:07.620
asks if I need any salt, pepper or butter.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.420
No, I don't.

12:10.420 --> 12:12.420
I don't need butter, Daniel.

12:12.420 --> 12:12.900
Secondly-

12:12.900 --> 12:13.860
It was Dave.

12:13.860 --> 12:15.380
Dave, sorry, Dave was his name.

12:15.380 --> 12:16.420
You're breaking the fiction.

12:17.060 --> 12:21.700
Secondly, thirdly, his hands are very dirty.

12:21.700 --> 12:26.260
Now Justin, he gets guacamole all over my damn plate.

12:26.260 --> 12:28.340
Was he dressed in any such manner

12:28.340 --> 12:30.900
that would make you think he worked at Panera Bread?

12:30.900 --> 12:33.060
None of it, none of it.

12:33.060 --> 12:39.380
It's yes, okay, yes, but his actions were so off the grid

12:40.420 --> 12:44.420
that it made me feel like he's gone rogue state or something.

12:44.420 --> 12:45.380
Like he has become a bad actor.

12:45.380 --> 12:48.900
Dave, there hasn't been a Dave here in over 50 years.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.660
Yeah, you got ghost served.

12:50.660 --> 12:52.740
I mean, we did suggest, I believe,

12:52.740 --> 12:54.500
either last or two episodes ago

12:54.500 --> 12:58.500
that people do take the art of restaurant serving

12:58.500 --> 12:59.620
into their own hands.

12:59.620 --> 13:01.540
So this could be a fan, this could be a fan.

13:01.540 --> 13:02.260
It could be a listener.

13:04.180 --> 13:07.460
He was there the last time we went to Panera too.

13:07.460 --> 13:08.820
And it has gotten to the point

13:08.820 --> 13:12.420
where my agency has been so removed.

13:12.420 --> 13:14.740
I feel like a prisoner in this Panera.

13:14.740 --> 13:17.940
I got up to get a fork for my family

13:17.940 --> 13:20.260
because we needed another one.

13:20.260 --> 13:22.740
And he intercepted me and asked what I needed

13:22.740 --> 13:24.740
and said he would get it for me.

13:24.740 --> 13:27.300
I want to get my own fork, Dave.

13:27.300 --> 13:30.340
Justin, I'm going to ask you the most important question

13:30.340 --> 13:31.700
about this entire scenario.

13:32.340 --> 13:32.980
Yeah.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.740
Did you tip Dave in any way?

13:35.380 --> 13:36.900
Oh, isn't this interesting?

13:36.900 --> 13:40.900
Now we've gotten to the real crux of the matter, isn't it?

13:40.900 --> 13:46.980
This is interesting because that was every fiber of my body

13:46.980 --> 13:49.140
said you have to tip this person now

13:49.140 --> 13:52.180
who's kept you prisoner at the local Panera Bread.

13:52.180 --> 13:55.860
You have to tip this person.

13:55.860 --> 13:59.300
But I bust my own table at Panera Bread.

13:59.300 --> 14:00.340
There's a system.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.100
I bust my own table, right?

14:02.100 --> 14:05.140
Like I was supposed to find my own family table.

14:05.140 --> 14:06.740
I bust my own table.

14:06.740 --> 14:11.380
So if I do that, then I've just left some dollars on a table.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.860
Like there's nothing, there's nowhere in the system

14:13.860 --> 14:16.100
where he's going to latch onto this money.

14:16.100 --> 14:19.220
So it would be me going to him and just handing him like,

14:19.220 --> 14:20.820
thanks for taking such good care of me.

14:20.820 --> 14:23.940
Please continue these actions for the foreseeable future.

14:23.940 --> 14:25.780
Hi, my name is Justin McElroy.

14:25.780 --> 14:29.540
I wanted to reinforce your behavior at this Panera Bread.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.260
So now I can't go to this Panera Bread

14:32.260 --> 14:37.060
because this guy is running it like it's his own private opium

14:37.060 --> 14:39.700
den where he's just like catering to everybody's wants

14:39.700 --> 14:43.380
when I just want to enjoy an independent excursion

14:43.380 --> 14:44.180
with my family.

14:44.180 --> 14:46.580
You don't want a Panera Bread concierge.

14:46.580 --> 14:49.780
No, I don't need another layer of interaction here.

14:49.780 --> 14:51.380
I just want to go up and order my food

14:51.380 --> 14:53.220
and then you hand me this great buzzer,

14:53.220 --> 14:54.180
which I love this.

14:54.180 --> 14:55.140
I love the buzzer.

14:55.140 --> 14:55.780
It's fun.

14:55.780 --> 14:57.300
Oh, it's a sexy little device.

14:58.980 --> 15:00.500
This is good tech.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.780
I don't have an iPhone anymore.

15:01.780 --> 15:03.220
I just have one of those buzzers

15:03.220 --> 15:05.380
that I stole from an Outback Steakhouse.

15:05.380 --> 15:06.980
It still buzzes sometimes

15:06.980 --> 15:09.060
and I think somewhere my steak's ready.

15:09.060 --> 15:10.420
It buzzes and that's how I know

15:10.420 --> 15:12.820
that I have to pick up my son from daycare

15:12.820 --> 15:14.100
because he has a sickness.

15:15.140 --> 15:16.660
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

15:16.660 --> 15:17.380
Yes, please.

15:17.380 --> 15:20.340
I'm sorry for your loss, Justin.

15:20.340 --> 15:21.620
I love to go with that Panera Bread

15:21.620 --> 15:22.820
and there's not another one close.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.540
Also, another important announcement earlier.

15:25.540 --> 15:27.780
I laughed hard at your story

15:27.780 --> 15:29.620
and the sound waves I made in Audacity

15:29.620 --> 15:31.620
looked exactly like a fish skeleton.

15:31.620 --> 15:33.060
It was so cool.

15:33.060 --> 15:34.740
This is a Yahoo that was sent in by Amy.

15:34.740 --> 15:35.220
Thanks, Amy.

15:35.220 --> 15:36.340
It's Yahoo Answers user.

15:36.900 --> 15:39.140
Oh, RonPaul2012 who asks,

15:39.140 --> 15:40.260
Oh, okay.

15:41.780 --> 15:43.780
Do I still have fraud protection

15:43.780 --> 15:46.180
if I post pics of my credit cards on Facebook?

15:46.740 --> 15:47.380
Oh my God.

15:48.740 --> 15:52.260
Did you say fraud protection or frond protection?

15:52.260 --> 15:52.900
Do you remember?

15:54.660 --> 15:57.860
Update, my friends show off their PS4 flat screen TV in cars.

15:57.860 --> 16:00.180
I want them to think I am rich with credit cards.

16:00.820 --> 16:04.500
Update two, and this is what update two says word for word.

16:04.500 --> 16:07.620
I have life locks so even if someone steals my identity,

16:07.620 --> 16:09.220
I'm confused.

16:12.660 --> 16:12.980
Okay.

16:13.780 --> 16:15.860
That sentence still works.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.980
That sentence still functions as a sentence.

16:18.980 --> 16:21.140
But you want all your friends to think

16:21.140 --> 16:22.980
you're rich with credit cards.

16:22.980 --> 16:26.420
And so you post pics of all these hot little plastic guys.

16:27.140 --> 16:30.740
And I mean, here's the thing.

16:31.780 --> 16:33.540
My Facebook group is pretty,

16:33.540 --> 16:35.940
my friend group is pretty tight at this point.

16:35.940 --> 16:39.460
So I'm almost kind of like the idea

16:39.460 --> 16:42.580
of posting one of my credit cards on Facebook

16:42.580 --> 16:44.420
and then seeing who my true friends are.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.860
Yeah, like a honey trap.

16:45.860 --> 16:46.100
Yeah.

16:47.620 --> 16:49.140
I will say to this question asker,

16:49.140 --> 16:52.100
when your friends post pictures of their big screen TVs

16:52.100 --> 16:53.940
and their cars,

16:53.940 --> 16:55.220
they're not saying,

16:55.220 --> 16:58.100
think about all the things I could buy with these cars.

16:58.100 --> 17:02.580
They are saying I used my money to buy these cars.

17:02.580 --> 17:06.420
So if you show your credit card, that's nothing.

17:06.420 --> 17:07.620
That's nothing.

17:07.620 --> 17:08.580
Well, hold on though,

17:08.580 --> 17:10.980
because if you do have a picture of you

17:10.980 --> 17:13.540
with a lot of money that you're rubbing

17:13.540 --> 17:14.660
and touching and throwing.

17:14.660 --> 17:17.380
Justin had credit cards when he was like 15.

17:17.380 --> 17:22.820
Yeah, I got a credit card to get a Reds baseball cap.

17:25.540 --> 17:26.340
It ruined me.

17:26.340 --> 17:30.580
That story ends with me going to a debt consolidation mafia dude.

17:30.580 --> 17:33.220
Getting that wide take.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.340
You still got the hat?

17:34.340 --> 17:35.460
Yeah, I still got the hat.

17:35.460 --> 17:36.420
Give me the hat.

17:36.420 --> 17:36.900
Okay.

17:36.900 --> 17:37.300
Give me the hat.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.180
The hat's mine now.

17:38.980 --> 17:41.780
Unless you get a credit card that has written on it,

17:41.780 --> 17:46.340
like there's a lot of money on this signed Mr. American Express.

17:46.340 --> 17:50.580
Well, there's gotta be still like that Jerry Seinfeld shit, right?

17:50.580 --> 17:54.260
There's still gotta be that black AMX with like,

17:55.540 --> 17:58.260
with a big gold chain around it

17:58.260 --> 18:02.180
that you have to keep attached to your wrist at all times.

18:02.180 --> 18:05.220
Like one of those big, big boys.

18:05.220 --> 18:07.300
One of those, I hear Jerry carries his around

18:07.300 --> 18:08.660
in a big block of ice

18:08.660 --> 18:11.380
and he swings it around on the chain like a mace

18:11.380 --> 18:12.980
and he smashes people who gets in the way

18:12.980 --> 18:14.420
of his big cars and coffee.

18:15.540 --> 18:17.620
Do you think that there's somebody who has

18:17.620 --> 18:20.340
that like super high level credit card

18:20.340 --> 18:23.300
but doesn't have a car to take a picture with

18:23.300 --> 18:28.340
or like a big screen TV to take a picture with?

18:28.340 --> 18:30.820
Not Jerry, because I know he's got cars.

18:30.820 --> 18:34.660
He's got the cars and I bet his TV is at least medium large.

18:35.540 --> 18:40.340
I bet he's got, I mean, it's gotta be 35, 36 inches on this one.

18:40.340 --> 18:43.460
What else is he gonna watch old episodes of his TV show on?

18:43.460 --> 18:46.100
It's actually, he's got a pretty, like it's a 24 inch,

18:46.100 --> 18:48.180
but it's CRT because he can't have any latency

18:48.180 --> 18:55.700
when he's trying to get down on some street fighter.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.460
He's a big fucking counter strike head

18:57.460 --> 18:59.540
and you can't just fucking, you can't give him

18:59.540 --> 19:00.420
the kind of delay.

19:06.340 --> 19:08.020
I think there's a cool way to do this.

19:08.020 --> 19:09.540
These pixels are so blurry.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.100
I think there's a cool way to do this.

19:16.100 --> 19:19.060
I think, do you think Jerry Seinfeld still plays Smash Brothers Melee

19:19.060 --> 19:22.180
and he doesn't like anything that, anyway, I could go on.

19:22.180 --> 19:23.780
You could post your credit card

19:23.780 --> 19:26.340
but cover the last number with your thumb.

19:26.900 --> 19:27.540
Perfect.

19:27.540 --> 19:29.540
And then it's like, yeah, you might get it,

19:29.540 --> 19:30.820
but do you wanna go to the trouble

19:30.820 --> 19:33.060
of typing in 10 different numbers?

19:33.060 --> 19:33.620
No.

19:33.620 --> 19:34.500
Of course not.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.580
No, no one's gonna steal that.

19:36.580 --> 19:38.500
Yeah, I think this is a cool thing to do

19:38.500 --> 19:41.540
and I think you should have fraud protection still

19:41.540 --> 19:43.940
because I think they've gotta be ready for this.

19:43.940 --> 19:45.940
If banks are doing one thing for us,

19:45.940 --> 19:47.940
let it be this one thing.

19:47.940 --> 19:50.820
Don't let it be thinking that somebody has stolen

19:50.820 --> 19:55.780
my debit card every time I spend more than $8 online

19:55.780 --> 19:56.580
on the internet.

19:57.380 --> 19:58.500
That's not a good service.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.460
This is a good service.

19:59.460 --> 20:00.660
Protect my man.

20:00.660 --> 20:03.300
I am pretty certain that the thing I'm about to say

20:03.300 --> 20:04.900
is 100% true.

20:04.900 --> 20:07.860
Didn't the person who was on the commercials for LifeLock

20:07.860 --> 20:10.340
and said, this is my social security number

20:10.340 --> 20:11.540
driving around this car,

20:11.540 --> 20:13.780
he got major league identity.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.100
Oh, he got completely shad racked.

20:16.100 --> 20:16.980
Yes.

20:16.980 --> 20:18.820
I thought that was true.

20:18.820 --> 20:19.940
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

20:19.940 --> 20:20.660
Just checking.

20:21.780 --> 20:24.100
Yeah, no, he got demolished his whole life.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.620
His whole life is fucked.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.300
I'm pretty sure the police are there

20:27.300 --> 20:29.220
to stop people from breaking into my house,

20:29.220 --> 20:31.140
but I'm pretty sure if I went somewhere and said,

20:31.140 --> 20:32.660
hey, are you all criminals?

20:32.660 --> 20:34.340
Here's some keys to my house.

20:34.340 --> 20:36.180
Here's when I won't be there.

20:36.180 --> 20:38.580
And also, here's my security system code.

20:38.580 --> 20:39.780
And then if they broke in,

20:39.780 --> 20:41.540
I don't think I could then call the police and be like,

20:41.540 --> 20:42.420
yeah, I did that.

20:42.420 --> 20:44.740
But also, you're the police.

20:44.740 --> 20:46.420
I can't believe we're about to talk about it again,

20:46.420 --> 20:48.420
but that could be the plot of Home Alone 6

20:49.060 --> 20:51.380
where the sticky bandits have long since died

20:51.380 --> 20:52.420
on one of their capers.

20:52.420 --> 20:53.780
And so Kevin's lonely

20:53.780 --> 20:55.940
and he needs somebody to do his traps on.

20:55.940 --> 20:58.340
And so he goes out and he does a commercial

20:58.340 --> 20:59.780
for local public access.

20:59.780 --> 21:00.980
Here's where my address is.

21:00.980 --> 21:02.340
I'll leave the door unlocked

21:02.340 --> 21:04.820
and I'll leave valuables scattered all throughout the house.

21:05.380 --> 21:08.340
I guarantee people are doing this on Craigslist, right?

21:08.340 --> 21:09.460
Please break into my house.

21:09.460 --> 21:11.620
Sure, people are home aloning.

21:11.620 --> 21:12.420
Home Alone RP.

21:13.460 --> 21:15.060
Uh, yowza.

21:15.060 --> 21:17.140
Hey, should we go to money zone?

21:17.780 --> 21:19.060
I'd love to head on over there.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.300
Because God knows I'll cut this out,

21:21.300 --> 21:24.020
but boy howdy, I could use some liquid assets right now.

21:24.020 --> 21:24.980
We need that money.

21:24.980 --> 21:26.900
Just spraying up a little bit of cash

21:26.900 --> 21:28.500
would be so good for me right now.

21:28.500 --> 21:29.780
Because they didn't warn us on edit

21:29.780 --> 21:31.300
that's out our business money, people.

21:31.300 --> 21:34.180
Didn't tell us that we wouldn't be able

21:34.180 --> 21:37.300
to just get the cut money back whenever we needed it.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.060
I didn't know that we'd have to be sort of

21:39.060 --> 21:42.820
alchemized into sales of the bean juice product.

21:53.860 --> 21:57.140
Our first sponsor this week is stamps.com.

21:57.140 --> 21:58.340
Oh, I love them.

21:59.060 --> 22:01.220
Yeah, I love them too.

22:01.220 --> 22:04.260
I love to go to the post office

22:04.260 --> 22:06.820
and everybody there is so nice and helpful,

22:06.820 --> 22:08.900
but sometimes I don't have the time for it.

22:08.900 --> 22:12.340
I'm a busy parent who's got,

22:12.340 --> 22:13.940
you know, I got taekwondo class,

22:13.940 --> 22:17.620
I gotta bake muffins for the glee club or whatever,

22:17.620 --> 22:18.820
you know, other parent stuff.

22:18.820 --> 22:20.180
And I don't always have time.

22:20.180 --> 22:21.780
But luckily stamps.com is there.

22:22.420 --> 22:24.180
It lets me use my computer to print

22:24.180 --> 22:28.820
official US postage 24-7 for any letter,

22:28.820 --> 22:30.740
any package, any class of mail,

22:30.740 --> 22:32.740
anywhere you want to send it.

22:32.740 --> 22:34.820
And with stamps.com you get five cents off

22:34.820 --> 22:36.180
every first class stamp

22:36.180 --> 22:39.060
and up to 40% off priority mail.

22:39.060 --> 22:40.740
Which, listen, when you're shipping

22:40.740 --> 22:44.100
50,000 hypothetical mugs, that really adds up.

22:44.100 --> 22:44.820
That adds up.

22:44.820 --> 22:46.500
That adds up fast.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.540
It adds up.

22:47.540 --> 22:50.580
Right now our listeners can get a special offer

22:50.580 --> 22:55.940
that includes a four-week trial plus free postage

22:55.940 --> 23:00.900
and a digital scale without any long-term commitment.

23:00.900 --> 23:02.660
Now let us save you one thing.

23:02.660 --> 23:05.940
A mug does weigh 10.4 ounces.

23:05.940 --> 23:10.980
So if you need to check that out, 10.4 ounces.

23:10.980 --> 23:13.380
If you have a scale and you're really looking

23:13.380 --> 23:15.300
for like an old balance scale,

23:15.300 --> 23:17.060
you could get a mug on one side,

23:17.060 --> 23:19.300
say a bean juice mug on one side,

23:19.300 --> 23:21.060
then anything that balances that,

23:21.060 --> 23:23.060
you'll know it's 10.4.

23:23.060 --> 23:25.540
I'm saying these mugs are good for just,

23:25.540 --> 23:27.220
more than just drinking out of.

23:27.220 --> 23:29.060
Yeah, you could use them as counterweights.

23:29.060 --> 23:29.560
Yeah.

23:29.560 --> 23:32.840
Yeah, so right now go to stamps.com,

23:32.840 --> 23:35.640
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage

23:35.640 --> 23:37.320

23:37.960 --> 23:41.480
That's stamps.com, enter my brother.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.400
All one word, my brother.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.320
So Squarespace is another service

23:45.320 --> 23:46.760
that has sponsored us this week

23:47.320 --> 23:48.920

or promote your physical or online business

24:05.080 --> 24:08.680
or announce an upcoming event or special project or more.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.080
If there's more things that you want to do with a website,

24:11.080 --> 24:13.000

They got beautiful customizable templates

24:15.240 --> 24:17.160
created by world-class designers.

24:17.160 --> 24:22.200
I'm talking about Megan Coolsites did one and-

24:22.200 --> 24:24.920
What, they got a Coolsites design?

24:24.920 --> 24:28.360
Stefan Hyperlinksman had made one

24:28.360 --> 24:30.280
and so they also have powerful

24:30.280 --> 24:32.040
e-commerce functionality as well.

24:33.160 --> 24:37.080
And that's so good for certain people's business

24:37.080 --> 24:38.760
that they need help with.

24:38.760 --> 24:41.960
And everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.080

Wow, this is weird.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.800
It says here we have a Jumbotron

25:03.800 --> 25:05.000
even though I thought we were done with it.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.680
But this is, let me see here.

25:06.680 --> 25:09.400
Oh, it's by Chrissy Teigen.

25:10.280 --> 25:11.160
Oh, shit.

25:11.160 --> 25:14.040
Chrissy Teigen wants to talk about bean juice mugs,

25:14.040 --> 25:16.200
which apparently she loves them.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.760
She says it's the best her coffee's ever tasted.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.840
And she recommends everybody gets one

25:22.840 --> 25:27.640
and goes to beanjuicemugs4, the number four, sale.com.

25:27.640 --> 25:28.680
Huh, wow.

25:28.680 --> 25:29.560
Thank you, Chrissy.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.000
Wow, that's so-

25:31.000 --> 25:31.720
So sick.

25:31.720 --> 25:32.040
So kind.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.680
And here's a picture of Chrissy and John

25:35.320 --> 25:36.680
and they're sipping each other's-

25:38.280 --> 25:39.000
I'll cut this out.

25:39.000 --> 25:39.720
That's not allowed.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.000
I don't think we can,

25:41.000 --> 25:42.600
I literally think it's a crime.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.200
I literally think what we're doing is a crime.

25:47.640 --> 25:50.200
Thanks so much to the over 28,000 members

25:50.200 --> 25:51.560

25:53.480 --> 25:55.160
and to all of our monthly members.

25:55.160 --> 25:57.000
To celebrate hitting our goal this year,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.800
we're putting the 2019 Max Fund Drive pins

25:59.800 --> 26:03.000

26:05.400 --> 26:07.880

26:09.320 --> 26:11.000
will support the National Court Appointed

26:11.000 --> 26:13.080
Special Advocates Association.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.960
National CASA does amazing work for children and youth

26:15.960 --> 26:19.480
through a national network of 950 member programs.

26:19.480 --> 26:21.720
We're proud to be able to support them.

26:21.720 --> 26:25.000
The pin sale will run from April 29th until May 10th.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.080

26:33.800 --> 26:34.600
And once again,

26:35.240 --> 26:35.720
thank you.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.080
I would like to take this opportunity

26:43.080 --> 26:44.600
to announce a new segment

26:44.600 --> 26:46.040
on my brother, my brother and me.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.840
I know it's always very hotly anticipated.

26:48.840 --> 26:49.640
You guys ready?

26:49.640 --> 26:50.200
Yes.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.160
We're off to see the lizard.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.640
Now this is a segment where we talk about

27:12.840 --> 27:14.520
Jimmy Buffett selling weed.

27:14.520 --> 27:17.160
And anytime Jimmy Buffett sells weed

27:17.160 --> 27:18.440
or weed-related products,

27:18.440 --> 27:19.400
we're going to feature it

27:19.400 --> 27:20.680
and off to see the lizard.

27:21.480 --> 27:22.520
This new segment.

27:22.520 --> 27:23.960
Is the lizard him?

27:25.560 --> 27:26.520
In this scenario?

27:27.320 --> 27:29.960
Listen, what am I, a music professor?

27:29.960 --> 27:31.400
Listen, I'm just a simple man

27:31.400 --> 27:33.640
who's reading a simple press release

27:33.640 --> 27:36.120
that is headlined, titled, sorry,

27:36.120 --> 27:39.320
Jimmy Buffett and Soterra Wellness

27:39.320 --> 27:40.840
Launch Cannabis Brand.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.280
And I'm going to read it to you.

27:42.280 --> 27:44.680
Soterra Wellness Launch Cannabis Brand,

27:44.680 --> 27:45.720
Coral Reefer.

27:45.720 --> 27:46.760
Oh, good.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.920
I like that, that's good branding.

27:48.920 --> 27:49.880
Now Coral Reefer,

27:50.520 --> 27:51.320
now that has been

27:51.320 --> 27:52.920
Jimmy Buffett's backing band

27:52.920 --> 27:55.000
since the 70s, the Coral Reefer band.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.600
It's hilarious, agreed.

27:56.600 --> 28:00.360
But this is an ancillary product,

28:00.360 --> 28:01.720
complimentary product.

28:01.720 --> 28:02.920
A range of,

28:03.480 --> 28:05.960
they say wellness-focused cannabis products.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.880
And lifestyle merchandise that's launching.

28:09.880 --> 28:10.920
Well, it just launched this week,

28:10.920 --> 28:12.200
actually, oh, last week.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.680
This highly anticipated Coral Reefer brand

28:14.680 --> 28:16.120
will be exclusively distributed

28:16.120 --> 28:19.160
through more than 20 Soterra Wellness Centers

28:19.720 --> 28:22.200
located in most major cities throughout Florida.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.320
And dark web, I bet.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.880
And probably through the dark web,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.240
James said, it never dawned on me

28:29.240 --> 28:31.080
that Coral Reefer would be anything other

28:31.080 --> 28:33.320
than a cool name for a tropical band

28:33.320 --> 28:34.920
born out of the Key West lifestyle

28:34.920 --> 28:35.880
of the mid-70s.

28:36.440 --> 28:37.640
I can smell salt,

28:37.640 --> 28:38.520
like as you're saying that,

28:38.520 --> 28:40.120
I smell salt water.

28:40.120 --> 28:43.000
Yes, but life is supposed to be about having fun

28:43.000 --> 28:44.840
and staying healthy enough to enjoy it.

28:44.840 --> 28:45.800
And I think Coral Reefer

28:45.800 --> 28:47.160
will help a lot of folks do that.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.680
Thank you, Jimmy.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.360
I think you're probably right.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.480
Probably my favorite

28:51.480 --> 28:54.040
is the uniquely designed vape pen

28:54.600 --> 28:55.800
called the Tide Rider

28:56.360 --> 28:58.120
that embodies the spirit of the brand

28:58.120 --> 29:00.280
with a sleek surfboard design,

29:01.240 --> 29:02.680
variable temperature controls,

29:02.680 --> 29:04.760
and advanced ceramic coil technology

29:04.760 --> 29:07.640
for a clean and consistent vaping experience.

29:07.640 --> 29:08.600
That's right, folks.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.480
Thanks.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.560
Jimmy Buffett is now providing you

29:11.560 --> 29:14.280
a clean and consistent vaping experience.

29:15.160 --> 29:17.320
And they got distinctive tropical design

29:17.320 --> 29:19.320
and Key West-inspired colors.

29:20.200 --> 29:24.840
So, we have four different formulations

29:25.480 --> 29:26.120
available.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.200
They tinker this shit up

29:28.200 --> 29:30.440
and did he Heisenberg this shit himself,

29:30.440 --> 29:31.160
these juices?

29:31.160 --> 29:34.520
Yeah, I gotta, I assume some testing.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.600
Judging from the interactions

29:36.600 --> 29:38.120
that I've had with Mr. Buffett,

29:38.120 --> 29:40.920
I think some testing was involved

29:40.920 --> 29:41.240
with the product.

29:41.240 --> 29:42.440
The press release goes on.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.800
Jimmy says, I actually,

29:43.800 --> 29:44.840
I'm gonna try one right now.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.520
And then the next paragraph is just like

29:46.520 --> 29:48.360
H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.800
There are four different

29:52.440 --> 29:54.680
CBD to THC ratios

29:54.680 --> 29:57.560
that range from mild to high intensity

29:57.560 --> 29:59.480
or as they have it labeled here,

29:59.480 --> 30:02.760
low tide, mid tide, high tide and tsunami.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.120
Ooh, all right.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.880
There's C's, S E A S.

30:07.880 --> 30:11.520
The Day, which is a CBD dominant blend

30:11.520 --> 30:13.360
that offers a gentle calming effect

30:13.360 --> 30:15.560
to help you breathe in, breathe out,

30:15.560 --> 30:17.560
and move on from the tension of your day.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.600
No thanks, I'll stick with a fast food hamburger

30:20.600 --> 30:21.720
for that one.

30:21.720 --> 30:25.000
Cabana Daydreamin' is a fresh evening breeze

30:25.000 --> 30:28.520
that delivers a balanced blend of CBD and THC

30:28.520 --> 30:30.480
for full body relaxation.

30:30.480 --> 30:34.000
Yes, oh, a fresh evening breeze.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.580
It's a fresh evening breeze.

30:35.580 --> 30:40.440
Stories We Could Tell is a relaxing THC rich blend

30:40.440 --> 30:42.640
to help you manage pain without drowsiness.

30:42.640 --> 30:43.480
That's me.

30:43.480 --> 30:45.240
So you can be present with friends and family.

30:45.240 --> 30:46.680
That me right there.

30:46.680 --> 30:49.280
I will always, I want to treasure my time with you boys

30:49.280 --> 30:53.400
so much more, and my friend, Jommie, has got me going.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.240
Yeah.

30:55.440 --> 30:58.320
And then last formulation we have here

30:58.320 --> 31:01.040
is surfing in a hurricane.

31:01.040 --> 31:04.000
I've been assuming this one just fucks you up, right?

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
Just kinda, just kinda demolishes you.

31:10.280 --> 31:14.760
Leaves scorched earth behind.

31:14.760 --> 31:17.720
It just, it actually says, partner, this one here

31:17.720 --> 31:19.520
is gonna fuck your whole project.

31:19.520 --> 31:22.400
Everyone just says, enjoy your Friday, see ya Monday.

31:23.720 --> 31:26.120
Mr. Margaritaville takes a ball peen hammer

31:26.120 --> 31:29.400
to what you call a life and leaves only rubble in his way.

31:29.400 --> 31:32.640
Puts you back together piece by piece in his own image.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.800
When asked about this last product,

31:34.800 --> 31:37.240
Mr. Buffett said, this shit right here?

31:37.240 --> 31:38.760
15 times in a row.

31:42.860 --> 31:45.040
Oh man, oh man.

31:45.040 --> 31:50.040
I assume that if there are formulations on here

31:51.240 --> 31:56.240
that share a name with the Margaritaville menu items

31:56.360 --> 31:58.540
that were also named after Jimmy Buffett songs,

31:58.540 --> 32:00.320
those are some good pairings right there.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.160
Absolutely.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.680
Absolutely good.

32:02.680 --> 32:05.680
Like a fine wine and a rich steak.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.240
How about a Yahoo?

32:07.240 --> 32:08.240
Yeah, absolutely.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.200
Here's one from Freddie, thanks Freddie.

32:11.200 --> 32:16.200
It's from Yahoo Answers user AJ14872001 who asks.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.040
Cyborg.

32:17.040 --> 32:19.520
Do the contestants actually die

32:19.520 --> 32:22.860
on Ellen's Game of Games in the final round?

32:24.060 --> 32:24.900
Probably.

32:24.900 --> 32:26.960
I don't think that this person is wondering this.

32:26.960 --> 32:29.760
I don't believe that this person

32:29.760 --> 32:31.000
is still thinking about this.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.760
At the end of the final round,

32:32.760 --> 32:37.360
if you do bad at her malevolent games,

32:37.360 --> 32:40.120
then the hole opens up behind under you

32:40.120 --> 32:43.120
and you fall through it and they don't show you again,

32:43.120 --> 32:44.960
as far as I know.

32:44.960 --> 32:45.800
And I think they did this,

32:45.800 --> 32:47.360
what was the other one, The Weakest Link?

32:47.360 --> 32:49.080
Didn't they do that on Weakest Link?

32:49.080 --> 32:51.720
They also did it, I don't know if this is a deep cut,

32:51.720 --> 32:55.360
but I believe it was remote control on MTV or VH1

32:55.360 --> 32:57.320
where everybody sat in armchairs

32:57.320 --> 32:58.880
and then if you got knocked out,

32:58.880 --> 33:01.440
they played hit the road jack, I believe,

33:01.440 --> 33:03.580
and pulled your chair backward through a wall

33:03.580 --> 33:05.400
which then closed around you.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.200
And I remember watching that as a child

33:07.200 --> 33:08.680
and I was like, that person's dead.

33:08.680 --> 33:11.440
Maybe also in Legends of the Hidden Temple

33:11.440 --> 33:12.880
when a temple guard grabs you,

33:12.880 --> 33:15.600
you might also have been dead then, I'm still not sure.

33:15.600 --> 33:18.900
If you have a life pendant, you're okay for the first one,

33:18.900 --> 33:20.480
but then the second one, yeah.

33:20.480 --> 33:21.640
You're dead.

33:21.640 --> 33:24.240
Now you are the next temple guard for the next run.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.080
I think we all can agree.

33:25.080 --> 33:27.120
I always felt in Legends of the Hidden Temple

33:27.120 --> 33:28.840
if you only had half a pendant when you got

33:28.840 --> 33:31.320
to that final round, you should be able to give that to them

33:31.320 --> 33:34.200
and they don't take you, but they do, I don't know,

33:34.200 --> 33:37.080
maybe take your helmet and your elbow pads and put it up.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.080
I always said if you have only half a pendant

33:39.080 --> 33:40.080
when you get to the final round,

33:40.080 --> 33:42.200
you should be able to try and use it like a weapon

33:42.200 --> 33:44.240
to cut or stab the temple guards.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.200
You should be able to attack the temple guards.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.760
There had to be some bloops of that, right?

33:49.760 --> 33:52.800
There had to be some temple guard injury bloops.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.160
Have to be, have to be.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.280
Because if I was running through the spider's web

33:56.280 --> 33:58.840
or like the shrine of the silver monkey

33:58.840 --> 34:00.520
and like a temple guard came out to grab me,

34:00.520 --> 34:02.560
I would be just throwing bows left and right.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.360
A temple guard would lose an eye.

34:04.360 --> 34:05.300
Oh yeah, I'd drop them.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.920
Yeah, I'd drop them right in Olmec's mouth

34:06.920 --> 34:07.800
and get them crunched up.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.520
I'd beat the shit out of them.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.760
I also think you should be able to try and trick Ellen

34:11.760 --> 34:15.320
to standing over the trap door and then you drop her in.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.320
That's the only way to defeat her.

34:17.320 --> 34:18.240
You're the host.

34:20.240 --> 34:23.200
Oh, Ellen, can I do a funny sketch?

34:23.200 --> 34:24.960
Ellen, I know you love those

34:24.960 --> 34:26.980
and I'll talk a little bit about Kristen Bell

34:26.980 --> 34:29.120
and Dax Shepard while I do so.

34:29.120 --> 34:30.240
Yeah, sure, what do you want me?

34:30.240 --> 34:31.300
Right here, Ellen.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.560
And then you steal her staff

34:33.560 --> 34:37.160
and you press the secret button embedded in the skull.

34:37.160 --> 34:39.920
That's kind of playing off how the last Saw movie ended

34:39.920 --> 34:42.820
with someone tricking Jigsaw into walking over a hole

34:42.820 --> 34:45.220
that they'd covered with leaves and branches.

34:45.220 --> 34:47.480
Which I always thought was just the funniest ending

34:47.480 --> 34:48.720
to that franchise ever.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.480
Where they're like, over here, over here, over here.

34:50.480 --> 34:54.800
Crash, oh no, I've been wasted by my own prince.

34:54.800 --> 34:57.420
The only way out of this one is,

34:57.420 --> 34:58.840
I didn't think about it ahead of time,

34:58.840 --> 35:01.360
but I didn't need to eat your own butt cheeks.

35:02.460 --> 35:05.240
If you eat them all up good and say how yummy they are

35:05.240 --> 35:07.740
and you love treasured your life.

35:07.740 --> 35:10.480
And leave a Yelp review about your butt cheeks.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.780
Do you think Jigsaw was watching

35:14.780 --> 35:19.800
the puzzle escape room craze and just like, um, hello?

35:19.800 --> 35:23.480
Hello, can I get a cut or a taste or something?

35:23.480 --> 35:27.200
So do the contestants actually get liquified

35:27.200 --> 35:29.600
on Ellen's Game of Games in the final round?

35:29.600 --> 35:30.440
Is the question.

35:30.440 --> 35:32.780
And I think we can all agree, probably not.

35:32.780 --> 35:35.040
But I think it would probably be good practice

35:35.040 --> 35:37.880
for these shows where adults and children

35:37.880 --> 35:40.360
drop through holes and are never seen from again.

35:40.360 --> 35:44.360
If immediately the camera cuts to them

35:44.360 --> 35:46.440
coming out the bottom of the slide

35:46.440 --> 35:48.680
and stays with them until they leave the building

35:48.680 --> 35:51.400
and get in their car to go drive home.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.560
I just didn't, just for my,

35:53.560 --> 35:55.640
just so I know that they're all right.

35:55.640 --> 35:57.440
Yeah, I bet that when you slide through

35:57.440 --> 35:59.280
like one of those holes and you land at the bottom,

35:59.280 --> 36:01.200
there's a producer there who's like, listen,

36:01.200 --> 36:03.560
you're not dead, but you could have been.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.280
Why did you come on this game?

36:05.280 --> 36:07.360
You didn't know what you're gonna do.

36:07.360 --> 36:08.680
Life is unpredictable.

36:08.680 --> 36:10.560
Why would you say yes to this?

36:10.560 --> 36:12.880
Let this be a lesson to you.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.620
Rob Lowe's doing one.

36:14.620 --> 36:16.760
Were you just about to talk about the Rob Lowe show?

36:16.760 --> 36:17.880
No, I wasn't.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.160
I was about to talk about the show, Who Done It?

36:20.160 --> 36:21.140
So you go ahead.

36:21.140 --> 36:23.040
Oh yeah, well in the Rob Lowe show,

36:23.040 --> 36:26.800
it's called Dizzy Trivia?

36:26.800 --> 36:28.280
No, Mental Samurai.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.480
That's even better.

36:29.480 --> 36:32.300
And then you're in this orb and trying to answer questions,

36:32.300 --> 36:34.320
but they're spinning you around very fast.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.780
But then if you miss too many questions,

36:35.780 --> 36:39.860
they spin it around, let's say extremely fast.

36:39.860 --> 36:44.040
And let's say the ball gets a little bit smaller as it goes.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.880
So you do the math on what happens

36:45.880 --> 36:47.960
to the human body inside of it, so.

36:47.960 --> 36:50.620
I wish I was there when Rob Lowe created this series

36:50.620 --> 36:53.280
and pitched it to the network with his own beautiful

36:53.280 --> 36:53.780
creation.

36:53.780 --> 36:56.120
Here's the thing, Grindr didn't work out too good,

36:56.120 --> 37:01.360
but I'd love to turn humans into candle wax using the globe.

37:01.360 --> 37:04.040
I think it did well enough that I can still

37:04.040 --> 37:07.160
liquify people with my incredible globe

37:07.160 --> 37:09.520
that I've been building in my garage.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.440
We can make the questions wicked easy,

37:11.440 --> 37:14.680
and therefore it can be a kind of population control thing.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.960
I'm Rob Lowe, and Dr. Vegas didn't do great,

37:16.960 --> 37:18.880
but I think it did well enough that I

37:18.880 --> 37:22.800
could create these murder spheres for your network.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.320
If they wouldn't let me do a show called The Grindr,

37:25.320 --> 37:28.560
then I'll create a Grindr for souls.

37:28.560 --> 37:31.960
There was a show called Whodunit that tragically only aired

37:31.960 --> 37:36.400
for nine episodes in the Halcyon Summer of 2013.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.280
And on this show is a murder mystery show,

37:38.280 --> 37:40.440
and one of the contestants would get killed

37:40.440 --> 37:42.800
at the end of every episode.

37:42.800 --> 37:46.280
And in the credits, they always had the person who got killed

37:46.280 --> 37:49.220
appear in a post-show interview while still

37:49.220 --> 37:51.040
in their murdered makeup.

37:51.040 --> 37:53.760
And you could tell that that was done

37:53.760 --> 37:57.320
so some tiny fraction of the audience wouldn't be like,

37:57.320 --> 38:02.320
uh, hello, a person has died, excuse me?

38:02.960 --> 38:04.460
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

38:04.460 --> 38:06.540
Okay, so this is wild.

38:06.540 --> 38:08.720
After The Grindr on Fox, there's this show

38:08.720 --> 38:12.440
where I saw a person straight up get fucking whacked,

38:12.440 --> 38:14.920
and then they're not even making a big deal out of it.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.600
Nobody's talking about it.

38:16.600 --> 38:17.960
They didn't even show them in the credits

38:17.960 --> 38:20.000
to let me know they're okay.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Could you go check on them, please?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.040
Hello, I was just watching a television show

38:24.040 --> 38:26.000
called Game of Thrones, and a lot of people

38:26.000 --> 38:27.160
appeared to be murdered.

38:27.160 --> 38:28.960
Somebody needs to get over there and check it out.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.680
It's in Westeros?

38:30.680 --> 38:34.160
There was a bad wedding, and I need like FBI

38:34.160 --> 38:35.000
or somebody to go check this out.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.760
Somebody needs to follow up on this.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.320
Who's ready for another question?

38:39.320 --> 38:44.320
Our next question is, I work at a VA that is fairly busy.

38:45.040 --> 38:48.000
The other day, I was leaving to get some lunch

38:48.000 --> 38:49.640
and walk down the main stairway.

38:49.640 --> 38:52.200
I said hello to some people as I got to the bottom,

38:52.200 --> 38:54.440
turned around, and proceeded to check my pants

38:54.440 --> 38:56.000
for my wallet.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.600
I've grown accustomed to smacking my phone,

38:58.600 --> 39:01.440
wallet, and keys when I leave places.

39:01.440 --> 39:05.480
However, I'm fairly certain I just walked down some stairs

39:05.480 --> 39:07.920
and drew attention to myself by saying hello,

39:07.920 --> 39:10.880
then turned around and smacked my right butt cheek

39:10.880 --> 39:13.260
in a lobby full of people.

39:13.260 --> 39:15.960
How do I face these coworkers, or am I just done?

39:15.960 --> 39:16.920
Do I pack up and leave?

39:16.920 --> 39:19.280
That's from Mortified Butt Smack.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.400
You know who I would love to weigh in on this?

39:23.400 --> 39:25.080
Who's that?

39:25.080 --> 39:26.120
You know Griffin Newman?

39:26.120 --> 39:28.760
He plays Arthur on The Tick?

39:28.760 --> 39:29.600
Oh, sure.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.440
Amazon?

39:30.440 --> 39:31.260
Yeah.

39:31.260 --> 39:32.100
Let me see if I can call him.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.940
How could we get Griffin Newman on our show so last minute?

39:34.940 --> 39:36.320
He's been on the call.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.160
Oh, what?

39:37.160 --> 39:38.000
The entire time.

39:38.000 --> 39:38.840
Griffin, are you still?

39:38.840 --> 39:40.000
Yeah, hey, what's going on, guys?

39:40.000 --> 39:42.760
Thank you for letting me listen in to the live recording.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.680
Matt, Griffin, other Griffin.

39:45.680 --> 39:46.520
Newman.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.200
Yeah, Griffin too, we can do Griffin too.

39:48.200 --> 39:50.160
Or Newman, yeah, we can go by Newman.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.280
I would like actually for me,

39:52.280 --> 39:55.240
for the remainder of this whole bit, this sketch,

39:55.240 --> 39:56.800
if I could just be called Shades.

39:56.800 --> 39:57.960
If you guys could give me that.

39:57.960 --> 39:58.800
Shades, okay.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.240
You can have Griffin for a little bit.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.240
Okay, and I just wanna say I now feel less cool

40:03.240 --> 40:05.840
because other Griffin has upgraded to Shades,

40:05.840 --> 40:08.600
so I prefer if you call me Downtown Griffin Nooms.

40:08.600 --> 40:09.440
You got it.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.260
Okay.

40:10.260 --> 40:11.100
I just don't want there to be

40:11.100 --> 40:13.800
sort of like a disproportionate coolness factor

40:13.800 --> 40:15.140
between the two Griffs.

40:15.140 --> 40:18.600
Just to clarify, can we just say Downtown then?

40:18.600 --> 40:19.640
Just call you Downtown?

40:19.640 --> 40:22.920
Or do we have to say Downtown Griffin Noom every time?

40:22.920 --> 40:24.440
Nooms with a Z.

40:24.440 --> 40:25.920
It's very important if you say the full thing

40:25.920 --> 40:26.760
that it ends with a Z.

40:26.760 --> 40:27.880
Nooms, sorry, excuse me.

40:27.880 --> 40:29.760
Otherwise, you can definitely call me Downtown

40:29.760 --> 40:31.880
or you can call me DTGN.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.600
Okay, hold on, now hold on.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.880
Because if Griffin you got to do that,

40:35.880 --> 40:37.560
I feel like I should have a chance to respond

40:37.560 --> 40:38.480
if we're doing proper debate format.

40:38.480 --> 40:39.520
A rebuttal, yeah, yeah.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.780
Right, and Shades sounds a little short now.

40:41.780 --> 40:43.000
You might wanna stretch out your nickname.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.280
Yeah, I need you to step it up to,

40:45.280 --> 40:47.480
mine up to, if you could just call me

40:47.480 --> 40:49.200
Morpheus from the Matrix.

40:49.200 --> 40:50.280
Cool.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.520
Or Matrix Morpheus if you wanna keep it short.

40:52.520 --> 40:54.800
I mean, MFTM is pretty clean.

40:54.800 --> 40:55.640
Yeah.

40:55.640 --> 40:58.140
Okay, all right, so we got Shades.

40:58.140 --> 40:59.920
We've got Morpheus from the Matrix.

40:59.920 --> 41:00.920
No, Shades is out.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.240
I'm Shades now.

41:02.240 --> 41:03.680
I'm Don't Big Justin.

41:03.680 --> 41:05.600
And my name's Griffin Newman.

41:05.600 --> 41:06.440
Okay, all right.

41:06.440 --> 41:11.400
So Downtown has paid the, let's just say,

41:11.400 --> 41:14.300
let's just say five digits to take the masterclass

41:14.300 --> 41:16.680
that we offer for podcasting where you can just kind of

41:16.680 --> 41:19.500
sit in and watch the sausage be made.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.440
He's been here for the entire five hour recording

41:21.440 --> 41:24.080
of this hour long episode.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.440
I unlocked a tier, yeah.

41:26.440 --> 41:28.700
Right, so you heard the question

41:28.700 --> 41:30.460
because you've been listening, you know,

41:30.460 --> 41:31.640
obviously to the entire thing.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.520
Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:33.520 --> 41:37.260
Is this a, are you a butt smack kind of person?

41:37.260 --> 41:38.320
Is this, is this a-

41:38.320 --> 41:40.120
What does that mean, Justin?

41:40.120 --> 41:43.040
Are you someone who smacks their butt to look for items?

41:43.040 --> 41:44.200
Well, okay.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.300
Oh man, that's a good question.

41:46.300 --> 41:47.140
I-

41:47.140 --> 41:48.880
Thank you, thank you.

41:48.880 --> 41:51.040
It felt bad as I was saying it,

41:51.040 --> 41:52.720
so it's such a relief to know it was good.

41:52.720 --> 41:53.960
It felt good getting it.

41:53.960 --> 41:56.120
Hearing it felt unbelievable.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.040
On the opposite side of the coin,

42:00.040 --> 42:03.960
I don't like having things in my back pockets

42:03.960 --> 42:06.060
because that feels bad to me.

42:06.060 --> 42:09.680
Because when I sit on it, it hurts my butt cheeks.

42:09.680 --> 42:14.100
So I am almost exclusively a front pocket guy

42:14.100 --> 42:19.100
and a items in the little pocket of my backpack guy.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.000
So like-

42:21.000 --> 42:21.840
Okay, okay.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.760
So my wallet, too big for the front pocket,

42:24.760 --> 42:27.320
constantly have it in the little backpack pocket.

42:27.320 --> 42:30.840
Cool, so you've just made yourself incredibly easy

42:30.840 --> 42:32.160
to steal from for everybody-

42:32.160 --> 42:35.080
100%, everyone knows, I'll run down again.

42:35.080 --> 42:37.260
Keys, little backpack pocket.

42:37.260 --> 42:40.040
Chapstick, left front pocket.

42:40.040 --> 42:42.040
If you kill Griffin in Crime Alley,

42:42.040 --> 42:45.300
you don't wanna waste a bunch of time searching everything.

42:45.300 --> 42:47.720
So make sure you just go straight for the good stuff.

42:47.720 --> 42:48.560
Now I have a-

42:48.560 --> 42:49.380
Are people getting pickpocketed

42:49.380 --> 42:50.880
for their chapstick all that often?

42:50.880 --> 42:52.200
This is, is there like-

42:52.200 --> 42:54.720
Nope, that's why I feel safe putting it in that pocket.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.320
That's why, because I just go like,

42:56.320 --> 42:58.560
I hope, you know, that's all they reach for.

42:58.560 --> 43:01.440
And then they, they're so dismayed that they put it back.

43:01.440 --> 43:05.920
You know, other items just to educate your listeners.

43:05.920 --> 43:09.140
Non-drivers New York State ID is in my wallet,

43:09.140 --> 43:12.220
which as mentioned previously is in the backpack pocket.

43:12.220 --> 43:15.120
Also my backpack pocket, my passport.

43:15.120 --> 43:17.040
I carry around with me at all times

43:17.040 --> 43:18.800
because I'm an erotic mess.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.840
So yeah, so if someone's trying to pickpocket me

43:20.840 --> 43:25.840
or backpack pocket me, backpack pickpocket me,

43:25.840 --> 43:28.620
it is very easy to steal my entire identity.

43:28.620 --> 43:29.460
Perfect.

43:29.460 --> 43:30.940
Do you carry your passport with you

43:30.940 --> 43:32.140
just in case of emergencies,

43:32.140 --> 43:35.220
in case you like accidentally fly to Tokyo, Narita,

43:35.220 --> 43:36.620
or like what's-

43:36.620 --> 43:38.480
Yes, nope, nope, exactly.

43:38.480 --> 43:42.640
I'm impressed that you nailed the specific emergency

43:42.640 --> 43:44.980
that I always have in the back of my mind.

43:44.980 --> 43:47.780
We're big proponents on this show, Griffin,

43:47.780 --> 43:50.180
of the idea that other people

43:50.180 --> 43:53.620
are not ever paying as close attention to you

43:53.620 --> 43:55.700
as you are to yourself.

43:55.700 --> 43:56.540
100%.

43:56.540 --> 43:59.100
Do you feel like there is anyone still thinking

43:59.100 --> 44:04.040
about this just very prominent butt smack?

44:05.060 --> 44:06.180
Yes, yes.

44:06.180 --> 44:07.500
Now here's- I agree.

44:07.500 --> 44:10.660
Now I wanna respond to this question

44:10.660 --> 44:12.380
with a question of my own,

44:12.380 --> 44:14.860
and I pose it to you fine gentlemen.

44:14.860 --> 44:18.760
Is there anything wrong with mortified butt smacks,

44:18.760 --> 44:22.660
coworkers thinking that they deliberately

44:22.660 --> 44:24.900
smacked their right butt cheek?

44:24.900 --> 44:27.260
That they were just kinda feeling they're sexy?

44:27.260 --> 44:28.100
Wow.

44:28.100 --> 44:28.920
And just like-

44:28.920 --> 44:31.320
Or it's like a sports motivation for yourself.

44:31.320 --> 44:32.700
It's been a long day at the VA.

44:32.700 --> 44:34.700
I imagine that job can get kind of exhausting

44:34.700 --> 44:36.300
depending on like what your role is there.

44:36.300 --> 44:39.100
And so, you know, it's obviously not appropriate.

44:39.100 --> 44:40.300
It's not a football team.

44:40.300 --> 44:42.380
And even then it's probably not even super appropriate

44:42.380 --> 44:44.220
for you to get a butt smack that lets you know like,

44:44.220 --> 44:46.820
okay, next play we're gonna do a Hail Mary and catch it.

44:46.820 --> 44:49.620
I think it's an exact combination of those two things.

44:49.620 --> 44:50.460
Yes.

44:50.460 --> 44:52.980
Maybe, I think it would depend on the kind of flair

44:52.980 --> 44:54.360
with which you did it,

44:54.360 --> 44:56.280
because there's definitely a sort of flair

44:56.280 --> 44:58.860
that would make it seem inappropriate.

44:58.860 --> 45:02.100
But I think you could do a flair that was just like,

45:02.100 --> 45:04.620
what a fun affectation.

45:04.620 --> 45:06.980
Yeah, and I think the idea of like this person,

45:06.980 --> 45:08.260
really their heads in the game,

45:08.260 --> 45:10.380
they're holding themselves to high standards.

45:10.380 --> 45:12.720
Maybe it's after lunch, other people are getting groggy,

45:12.720 --> 45:14.880
and you just look at them and you go like, wow,

45:14.880 --> 45:17.180
this person is making sure that their head

45:17.180 --> 45:20.580
is still in the game by smacking their hand on their butt.

45:20.580 --> 45:25.580
We rarely talk about geometry on My Brother, My Brother, Me,

45:26.780 --> 45:31.780
but this does seem to be a case where the response

45:31.780 --> 45:34.940
and your sort of following actions

45:34.940 --> 45:38.780
are completely dependent on the exact angle

45:38.780 --> 45:41.820
that your arm was at when this situation occurred.

45:41.820 --> 45:43.460
Now, if you could visualize with me,

45:43.460 --> 45:46.500
if your arm is at a kind of a crook

45:46.500 --> 45:47.740
and you just kind of reached down there

45:47.740 --> 45:49.800
and gave yourself a quick smack-a-roony,

45:49.800 --> 45:51.020
this is probably not something

45:51.020 --> 45:52.580
you need to continue to address.

45:52.580 --> 45:57.580
If we had a 180, sort of a straight line windmill action,

45:58.300 --> 46:00.460
where you sort of like, like around,

46:00.460 --> 46:02.660
you had like follow through, you had a windup.

46:02.660 --> 46:07.420
Sort of like a Fosse style, you know, flourish,

46:07.420 --> 46:10.140
leading to the butt smack, that seems critical.

46:10.140 --> 46:11.140
If you were leaning to the side a little bit,

46:11.140 --> 46:13.800
like you're a little teapot, right?

46:13.800 --> 46:16.400
And maybe if you did like an ah afterwards,

46:16.400 --> 46:17.240
that's probably bad.

46:17.240 --> 46:21.180
I think that would be a game changer,

46:21.180 --> 46:23.860
if there's any sort of ah at the end of it.

46:23.860 --> 46:27.180
I think another question is, it says here,

46:27.180 --> 46:29.580
I just want to litigate the writing here.

46:29.580 --> 46:32.700
Said hello, turned around,

46:32.700 --> 46:35.460
and smacked my right butt cheek in a lobby.

46:35.460 --> 46:37.100
It's huge, that's huge.

46:37.100 --> 46:39.940
You have found the sort of encyclopedia brown

46:39.940 --> 46:41.540
hidden clue here that this person

46:41.540 --> 46:44.060
did spin around to give him a great view.

46:44.060 --> 46:45.940
It makes it seem targeted, doesn't it?

46:45.940 --> 46:47.820
It seems so targeted.

46:47.820 --> 46:50.580
I wanted to make sure you had the best seat in the house.

46:50.580 --> 46:52.740
I want to make sure you got the clean

46:52.740 --> 46:54.780
bird's eye view of this thing.

46:54.780 --> 46:58.880
But here's the one question, if it's a clean turnaround,

46:58.880 --> 47:01.140
and the butt smack happens,

47:01.140 --> 47:03.460
and then they proceed to walk away,

47:03.460 --> 47:07.040
that feels to me like a power move, like a confidence move.

47:07.040 --> 47:09.100
I know this person's a real player.

47:09.100 --> 47:10.940
They showed up to win, you know?

47:10.940 --> 47:13.140
Like confidence is the only currency

47:13.140 --> 47:15.100
we still have in this bankrupt world.

47:15.100 --> 47:18.900
I would feel encouraged about their commitment to the job.

47:18.900 --> 47:23.180
Now here's the potential fly in the ointment.

47:23.180 --> 47:26.780
If in the embarrassment of doing that,

47:26.780 --> 47:30.420
at any point before, after, or during

47:30.420 --> 47:32.980
the immediate vicinity of the butt smack,

47:32.980 --> 47:35.260
they did a little sort of whoomy

47:35.260 --> 47:40.000
head turn over the shoulder and made eye contact.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.620
If you did sort of what I would call

47:41.620 --> 47:43.780
the copper tone kid, right?

47:43.780 --> 47:46.540
Butt towards the audience, but also your locked eyes

47:46.540 --> 47:49.060
in this sort of embarrassed look,

47:49.060 --> 47:51.460
then I think you've blown it.

47:51.460 --> 47:54.500
Quit the job, retire, move out of the country.

47:54.500 --> 47:55.860
Now you're a little rascal.

47:55.860 --> 47:59.780
You went from being a confident player to a little rascal.

47:59.780 --> 48:01.100
You become a little stinker.

48:01.100 --> 48:01.940
Yeah, most definitely.

48:01.940 --> 48:03.700
That feels completely authoritative.

48:03.700 --> 48:05.780
I'm glad we could help so much.

48:05.780 --> 48:07.180
Real quick, I want to get a hand on the ball

48:07.180 --> 48:08.820
and just say, when I do this, I like to do

48:08.820 --> 48:10.860
the testicle spectacles wallet and watch bit

48:10.860 --> 48:11.700
from Austin Powers.

48:11.700 --> 48:14.340
People fucking love it, and it's been so long,

48:14.340 --> 48:15.900
they forgot, and they think it's my thing,

48:15.900 --> 48:17.460
and people love it.

48:17.460 --> 48:19.420
Griffin, you've got a TV show.

48:19.420 --> 48:21.780
The second season is out right now.

48:21.780 --> 48:23.860
Can you tell people about it?

48:23.860 --> 48:24.900
It's not a TV show.

48:24.900 --> 48:25.820
It is a web series.

48:25.820 --> 48:27.100
It's a long form web series.

48:27.100 --> 48:27.980
It's on Amazon Prime.

48:27.980 --> 48:29.760
No, everything's a TV show now.

48:29.760 --> 48:31.380
Please don't take it from us,

48:31.380 --> 48:35.340
because we call ours a TV show,

48:35.340 --> 48:38.340
and that streaming service doesn't even exist anymore.

48:38.340 --> 48:40.180
We need this legitimacy, please.

48:40.180 --> 48:42.500
Okay, okay, fine. Please, downtown grippy nooms.

48:42.500 --> 48:46.400
Fine, I am on a prestige television series.

48:46.400 --> 48:47.240
Thank you.

48:47.240 --> 48:50.920
Produced by the Amazon company of the Americas.

48:50.920 --> 48:52.180
It's called The Tick.

48:52.180 --> 48:56.880
This show is based off of Funny Books,

48:56.880 --> 48:58.380
which is a comic book in the 80s

48:58.380 --> 49:01.820
that's a satire of superheroes created by Ben Edlund,

49:01.820 --> 49:06.260
and was revived into a, or vived.

49:06.260 --> 49:09.260
It wasn't revived, it was vived for the first time

49:09.260 --> 49:10.900
into a cartoon show in the 90s,

49:10.900 --> 49:12.900
and then a sitcom in 2001,

49:12.900 --> 49:17.900
and then now a more serialized, higher budget,

49:18.820 --> 49:22.020
very difficult to produce Amazon series.

49:22.020 --> 49:23.760
I adore this show.

49:23.760 --> 49:26.620
I think that it really,

49:26.620 --> 49:29.700
I think satire almost doesn't feel right to me.

49:29.700 --> 49:32.140
It feels like a real genuine examination

49:32.140 --> 49:36.020
of where superheroes would fit in our world,

49:36.020 --> 49:38.180
and what we still need them for,

49:38.180 --> 49:41.300
and what that means in a way that's like,

49:41.300 --> 49:42.620
I think a lot more thought provoking

49:42.620 --> 49:47.580
than I sort of expected from The Tick.

49:47.580 --> 49:49.380
Yeah, I think that's what we're trying to do.

49:49.380 --> 49:53.260
The previous versions of the show have been great,

49:53.260 --> 49:57.100
but they have been more like straightforward sort of parody,

49:57.100 --> 49:59.300
and I think now that we're in

49:59.300 --> 50:02.900
like such a superhero excess culture,

50:02.900 --> 50:04.420
Ben has been trying to make a show

50:04.420 --> 50:06.260
that's really examining why we're so obsessed

50:06.260 --> 50:07.460
with superheroes.

50:07.460 --> 50:09.620
And people can see this now, is that right?

50:09.620 --> 50:11.220
Is currently on Amazon?

50:11.220 --> 50:12.940
Yes, no staggered release.

50:12.940 --> 50:16.400
All 10 episodes season two on Amazon Prime.

50:16.400 --> 50:19.900
All 12 episodes of season one on Amazon Prime.

50:19.900 --> 50:21.680
People say, oh, I have Amazon,

50:21.680 --> 50:23.580
but I don't have the video thing.

50:23.580 --> 50:24.740
I think you're wrong.

50:24.740 --> 50:28.040
If you got Prime, if you got that free shipping,

50:28.040 --> 50:29.460
you got the video.

50:29.460 --> 50:32.500
And I also believe there are a lot of free

50:32.500 --> 50:37.220
sort of one month trial offers that are going on right now,

50:37.220 --> 50:40.300
where you can sign up, watch our 22 episodes,

50:40.300 --> 50:41.880
and then bail if you want.

50:41.880 --> 50:45.540
Don't tell Daddy Bezos that I said that,

50:45.540 --> 50:48.020
but I'm telling you that you can.

50:48.020 --> 50:49.260
It is your right.

50:49.260 --> 50:51.580
Folks, listen, don't hesitate.

50:51.580 --> 50:52.980
If our experience has taught us anything,

50:52.980 --> 50:55.700
it's that streaming services can collapse overnight.

50:55.700 --> 50:58.780
You never know, tomorrow is not promised to you.

50:58.780 --> 51:01.940
So spend today watching all of The Tick on Amazon Prime.

51:01.940 --> 51:03.700
I think Amazon's having money problems

51:03.700 --> 51:04.740
because they keep on telling me

51:04.740 --> 51:07.420
they don't have the budget to do certain things.

51:07.420 --> 51:11.660
So I'm a little worried about how liquid they are.

51:11.660 --> 51:13.020
Every time I pitch them something,

51:13.020 --> 51:14.700
they go, I don't know if we have it in the budget.

51:14.700 --> 51:18.660
So I think they might be a little tight on cash these days.

51:18.660 --> 51:21.440
Now you have another podcast as well, right?

51:21.440 --> 51:23.940
Yeah, I count this as my first podcast, of course.

51:23.940 --> 51:26.660
I tell people that this is one of my podcasts

51:26.660 --> 51:29.500
because I do listen in to every episode live.

51:29.500 --> 51:30.900
But then I have a podcast called Blank Check

51:30.900 --> 51:32.180
with Griffin and David.

51:32.180 --> 51:33.820
You saw that as sort of an invitation

51:33.820 --> 51:35.340
to plug your other podcast.

51:35.340 --> 51:36.660
Okay, I hear you to be more clear.

51:36.660 --> 51:38.220
I felt like that was a door being opened.

51:38.220 --> 51:40.820
Yeah, did I greatly misread that situation?

51:40.820 --> 51:43.140
I could see where the disconnect happened, for sure.

51:43.140 --> 51:44.940
Right, right, that was not your intent.

51:44.940 --> 51:47.620
You wanted to just sort of declare war against my podcast?

51:47.620 --> 51:50.100
Was that what that was?

51:50.100 --> 51:50.940
Were you trying to big dog me?

51:50.940 --> 51:52.020
Just trying to dismantle your brand, I guess.

51:52.020 --> 51:53.980
You were trying to big dog, okay, okay.

51:55.380 --> 51:56.780
Fantastic, well, Griffin, thank you so much.

51:56.780 --> 51:58.580
Oh, sorry, downtown.

51:58.580 --> 51:59.820
Thank you so much for joining us.

51:59.820 --> 52:00.900
We really appreciate you.

52:00.900 --> 52:01.980
Please, such a pleasure.

52:01.980 --> 52:05.740
And I'll, I mean, I won't speak to you guys soon,

52:05.740 --> 52:07.740
but I will listen to you guys soon

52:07.740 --> 52:08.780
the next time you record.

52:08.780 --> 52:11.780
And I just silently sit here and absorb.

52:11.780 --> 52:13.340
Speaking of absorb, let me go ahead

52:13.340 --> 52:15.860
and just absorb you back into my body.

52:15.860 --> 52:16.900
So come real close.

52:16.900 --> 52:17.740
Oh, cool.

52:22.380 --> 52:23.220
All right.

52:23.220 --> 52:24.860
Let's go.

52:24.860 --> 52:28.980
Thank you so much to downtown for his contribution.

52:28.980 --> 52:29.860
Please go watch The Tick.

52:29.860 --> 52:32.860
I adore this show, and I think that you really will too

52:32.860 --> 52:36.220
if you like our show and have excellent tastes

52:36.220 --> 52:37.580
as that would demonstrate.

52:37.580 --> 52:38.980
That's not a paid promotion, by the way.

52:38.980 --> 52:40.220
I know there's some people out there.

52:40.220 --> 52:42.540
We just, we like Griffin in the show.

52:42.540 --> 52:44.740
We just enjoy it.

52:44.740 --> 52:46.540
So check that totally out.

52:46.540 --> 52:48.700
We're coming to Cincinnati and Cleveland soon.

52:48.700 --> 52:51.980
We'll be Cleveland May 15th and Cincinnati May 16th.

52:51.980 --> 52:53.540
If you haven't gotten your tickets yet,

52:53.540 --> 52:56.060
as well as all of our other tour dates,

52:56.060 --> 52:57.500
you can find the other tour dates

52:57.500 --> 53:01.900
and get tickets at McElroy.family and click on tours.

53:01.900 --> 53:04.140
We have tours that are listed through November.

53:04.140 --> 53:06.740
So those are already starting to sell out.

53:06.740 --> 53:08.660
I would say at this point, like one quarter

53:08.660 --> 53:11.460
to a third of the dates are already sold out.

53:11.460 --> 53:12.340
So don't wait.

53:12.340 --> 53:14.820
Go get those now, McElroy.family.

53:14.820 --> 53:17.900
We also have merch, and there will be new merch

53:17.900 --> 53:21.380
on May 1st at McElroymerch.com.

53:21.380 --> 53:26.100
And man, if you, oh boy, you really can't go wrong

53:26.100 --> 53:27.540
with a bean juice mug.

53:27.540 --> 53:31.620
Good for any occasions, birthdays, holidays.

53:31.620 --> 53:34.620
Put a chain through the handle, now it's a cool necklace.

53:34.620 --> 53:36.580
There's so much, I can think of 10 ways

53:36.580 --> 53:38.020
to accessorize with bean juice.

53:38.020 --> 53:40.860
Maybe with like a really cool, like chill cat.

53:40.860 --> 53:42.380
It could be like a hat for them.

53:42.380 --> 53:43.820
Sure, sure.

53:43.820 --> 53:46.860
I wanna thank John Roderick, who's a big bean juice fan.

53:46.860 --> 53:48.760
He told me yesterday in the long winters

53:48.760 --> 53:49.640
for the use of our theme song.

53:49.640 --> 53:50.580
It's a departure off the album,

53:50.580 --> 53:51.420
Putting the Days to Bed.

53:51.420 --> 53:53.500
You can find a link to that.

53:53.500 --> 53:55.500
I mean, that's not what I say on this show,

53:55.500 --> 53:57.620
but you can find a link to that pretty much anywhere.

53:57.620 --> 54:01.900
And it's a good song, great tune, great oldies.

54:01.900 --> 54:05.580
104.6, my brother, my brother, and me.

54:05.580 --> 54:07.300
Do you guys want the final yahoo?

54:07.300 --> 54:08.140
Yes, please.

54:08.140 --> 54:10.900
This final yahoo is sent in by Michelle, who asks,

54:12.480 --> 54:16.460
how bad is Cheesecake Factory for my body?

54:16.460 --> 54:19.540
My name is Justin McElroy.

54:19.540 --> 54:20.660
I'm Travis McElroy.

54:20.660 --> 54:22.140
I'm Griffin McElroy.

54:22.140 --> 54:24.740
It's been my brother, my brother, me, damn.

54:24.740 --> 54:26.180
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

54:26.180 --> 54:27.820
Kiss your dad, squirt on the lips.

54:30.780 --> 54:35.780
Hey, Griffin Girls, do you wanna just say that I wanna?

54:44.800 --> 54:46.720
Maximumfun.org.

54:46.720 --> 54:47.780
Comedy and culture.

54:47.780 --> 54:48.820
Artist-owned.

54:48.820 --> 54:50.040
Listener-supported.

54:51.580 --> 54:54.260
Listen, we already know that you love genre movies,

54:54.260 --> 54:56.100
film craft, and female filmmakers.

54:56.100 --> 54:58.020
So if you love all those things,

54:58.020 --> 54:59.620
then by transitive property,

54:59.620 --> 55:01.860
you love my podcast, Switchblade Sisters.

55:01.860 --> 55:03.420
Hi, I'm film critic April Wolf.

55:03.420 --> 55:04.820
Every week, I have a conversation

55:04.820 --> 55:06.180
with a different female filmmaker

55:06.180 --> 55:07.540
about their favorite genre film.

55:07.540 --> 55:09.620
Each episode covers the filmmaking process,

55:09.620 --> 55:10.860
working in the film industry,

55:10.860 --> 55:13.820
and just like general geeking out about awesome movies.

55:13.820 --> 55:14.860
I've had such great guests

55:14.860 --> 55:16.620
like the big sick writer, Emily Gordon.

55:16.620 --> 55:18.420
To me, indie movies, as of late,

55:18.420 --> 55:20.220
have come to be a catch-all term

55:20.220 --> 55:22.560
for a movie that kind of defies genre.

55:22.560 --> 55:24.980
Billy Madison and half-fake director, Tamra Davis.

55:24.980 --> 55:27.540
When a comedian comes and enters onto my set,

55:27.540 --> 55:29.860
they're just there to be funny,

55:29.860 --> 55:32.420
and we're all ready and waiting for them to be funny.

55:32.420 --> 55:35.060
Horror industry veteran and actor, Barbara Crampton.

55:35.060 --> 55:36.960
That's where real drama lies for me.

55:36.960 --> 55:40.500
What's between you and I speaking right now?

55:40.500 --> 55:42.140
Where are we meeting?

55:42.140 --> 55:44.380
And what's the energy that we create between us?

55:44.380 --> 55:45.680
And so many others.

55:45.680 --> 55:47.740
So check out Switchblade Sisters every Thursday

55:47.740 --> 55:52.740
on MaximumFun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.
