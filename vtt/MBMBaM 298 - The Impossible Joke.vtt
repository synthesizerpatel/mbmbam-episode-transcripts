00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:44.480
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.920
Hello, welcome my brother, my brother and me to the advice show for the modern era.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.840
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:51.840 --> 00:57.600
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. And normally we would be a little uneasy right now

00:57.600 --> 01:00.880
because we didn't really prep what we were going to say at the beginning,

01:00.880 --> 01:04.800
but the good news is I got the answer baby. I kind of guessed that because you were

01:04.800 --> 01:08.560
chuckling through like you're saying your name and I was like oh he thought of something.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.320
Oh he's got some, he got that nudge. This is really, this is really good. You ready?

01:12.320 --> 01:15.920
Yeah. MTV Movie Awards were last night.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.600
Oh how did they go Justin? Didn't watch.

01:19.600 --> 01:20.560
Okay. So.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.120
But here's how I think they went. Okay.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.320
Big wins all around for some of Hollywood's heaviest hitters.

01:26.320 --> 01:35.920
Rebel Wilson was back. She's getting it done. I bet Adam Driver won for best villain if I had to guess.

01:35.920 --> 01:42.320
Justin what are your favorite MTV Movie Awards specific categories? Not like your best actor,

01:42.320 --> 01:44.880
your best actor. I'm talking specifics.

01:44.880 --> 01:50.320
Okay my favorite, if I had to make a list and it is, let me say,

01:50.320 --> 01:58.160
so hard to choose. Okay. My favorite would be best actor who pretended to be short

01:58.160 --> 02:01.840
by putting shoes on their knees like Tim Conway in Dwarf.

02:01.840 --> 02:05.280
Yeah. Which is strangely a heavily contested,

02:05.280 --> 02:07.920
like you'd be amazed how many people up for that every year.

02:07.920 --> 02:11.920
Tom Hanks won that one. Tom Hanks won that one this year. For Bridge of Spies.

02:12.720 --> 02:17.280
You know it's funny, I actually, I think that it should have an asterisk because like he

02:17.280 --> 02:24.000
actually had his legs cut off at the knees and shoes sewn to his knees and then afterwards

02:24.000 --> 02:30.080
had his legs sewn back on. And that's like, we can't all afford that surgery Tom.

02:30.080 --> 02:34.480
Exactly. I know you had to rule him out. I know you're on some method shit playing

02:34.480 --> 02:41.680
little lawyer in Bridge of Spies, but it's not a fair and balanced field is it? It's bullshit.

02:41.680 --> 02:48.560
I like, I've always liked the best kiss category and I want to say a big congratulations to

02:49.280 --> 02:54.320
Inside Out for that when all the emotions just had a big kissing party there at the end of Inside

02:54.320 --> 02:58.480
Out. I really like that and I do want to say I was really surprised by the winner of the

02:58.480 --> 03:02.560
best piss category and that's a new one for 2016.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.400
And who won that one Griffin? Who won that one? Who brought that home?

03:06.400 --> 03:07.440
Also Inside Out.

03:07.440 --> 03:12.000
Wow! Same scene.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.480
Because the emotions in that movie were joy, anger, fear, disgust, sadness, and then like

03:18.480 --> 03:22.480
that feeling you get when you have a pee that you've held in for a while and it feels so

03:22.480 --> 03:26.320
good and that one was voiced by Martin Short who accepted the award last night on behalf

03:26.320 --> 03:27.360
of Pixar.

03:27.360 --> 03:29.680
And pissed on the entire front row.

03:29.680 --> 03:34.480
I thought his yellow tuckles was a nice touch. That's what you can expect from a true professional

03:34.480 --> 03:39.600
entertainer. I also, I really appreciated how he made sure to thank Pissar. He like said

03:39.600 --> 03:41.600
Pixar but he worked piss into it.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.560
I thought that was a nice touch too.

03:44.560 --> 03:50.960
And then John Lasseter was like finally somebody gets it. Finally some recognition for my good

03:50.960 --> 03:51.920
waterworks.

03:51.920 --> 03:57.200
My other favorite category of the MTV Movie Awards is best dog humping someone's leg while

03:57.200 --> 04:02.240
someone else looks on like yeah. That was Randy Quaid again.

04:02.240 --> 04:08.400
That was Randy Quaid again for his performance in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.320
That's like 20 years running.

04:10.320 --> 04:16.640
20 years running. Yeah. Such a huge gift for him. So, so, so, so happy for him to come

04:16.640 --> 04:23.040
out of. They did have to film it. He was kind of Skyped in from his cave but he looked great

04:23.040 --> 04:26.720
and he had a really nice tux that he had fashioned out of tar and leaves.

04:26.720 --> 04:34.160
Yeah and I was really psyched this year that he's gotten some like a lot but for the award

04:34.160 --> 04:39.600
for best Randy Quaid impersonator I was psyched to see Dandy Quaid finally get his like get

04:39.600 --> 04:44.640
get gacked up there because like God knows he's worked for it for so long and it's about

04:44.640 --> 04:47.920
time that somebody was like Dandy you're doing a fucking great job up there.

04:47.920 --> 04:51.680
And it was actually a lot like Dave because at a certain point people stopped being able

04:51.680 --> 04:54.240
to tell the difference between Randy Quaid and Dandy Quaid.

04:54.240 --> 04:59.200
Actually Dandy Quaid has been working a lot as Randy Quaid and his rate is higher.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.080
Like that's the only way you could get Randy Quaid cheaper.

05:03.360 --> 05:08.080
My favorite part of when Dandy Quaid was on stage is after he accepted the award and you

05:08.080 --> 05:10.400
know there's obviously some co-marketing going on here.

05:10.400 --> 05:10.640
Yeah.

05:10.640 --> 05:15.120
But he was like and now that I got the award let me give you all a little sneak peek of

05:15.120 --> 05:18.000
what's coming in 2017.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.120
And then there was like a 30 second teaser trailer where just very slowly from black

05:23.120 --> 05:24.960
emerged the word Dennis.

05:24.960 --> 05:25.200
Yeah.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.520
And he was like that's how we're doing it.

05:27.520 --> 05:32.240
And there were fireworks and stuff shooting out and Dennis Quaid stood up like hell yeah

05:32.240 --> 05:33.360
and I don't know why he was there.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.440
He doesn't understand.

05:35.440 --> 05:39.760
He's about his career is almost over because once Dandy Quaid is in the mix like you're

05:39.760 --> 05:40.960
different you are defunct.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.000
You got assimilated.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.120
Hold on Griffin I hate to disagree with you but I think that capitalism-

05:45.120 --> 05:46.960
You love to disagree with me more than anything in the world.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.240
That's your favorite fucking thing in the world.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.600
I think that competition will breed a better Quaid.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.160
You know what I mean.

05:52.160 --> 05:56.080
I think maybe the problem is Dennis has been resting on those laurels for too long.

05:56.080 --> 05:59.760
He's been sitting around on his laurels and he's grown fat and happy.

05:59.760 --> 06:06.320
And now we need to get like I can't think of a good pun name from Dennis but it will

06:06.320 --> 06:07.120
happen.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.880
Dandy will definitely think of it.

06:08.880 --> 06:13.680
And then we're going to get a better breed of Quaid from the competition.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.320
It'll be the Quadiest Quaid.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.560
It's the Quaid arms race.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.160
It's like it's like yeah.

06:20.160 --> 06:20.660
Yeah.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.800
So this is an advice show as I'm sure you guessed.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.040
And what we do on this show is we take advice-

06:27.040 --> 06:27.040
Menace?

06:27.040 --> 06:28.640
Is it Menace Quaid?

06:28.640 --> 06:28.800
No.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.520
No that's not it.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.800
Menace Quaid.

06:30.800 --> 06:31.840
I'll keep working on it.

06:31.840 --> 06:32.080
Menace, his son.

06:33.120 --> 06:33.520
Listen.

06:34.080 --> 06:34.560
Penace?

06:34.560 --> 06:37.600
We've done this 297 times believe it or not.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.160
And this is the 298th time we've done it.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.640
And we're going to do it at least 300 more times.

06:42.640 --> 06:43.200
Did you know that-

06:43.200 --> 06:43.920
Let's just get going.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.280
Wait just a real quick fun fact.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.360
Fun my bim bam McRoy family factoid.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.840
You can color this in on the back of your cracker barrel menu.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.600
Because did you know that there's a bonus Quaid?

06:52.960 --> 06:53.680
I did not know that.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.640
There's a real Quaid and he's a half-brother to Dennis and Randy.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.080
Bonus Quaid is what I call him.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.640
His real name is not much better.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.000
It's actually Buddy Quaid.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.400
And that's a true fact.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.120
That's a true fact.

07:05.120 --> 07:05.920
He's 41 years old.

07:05.920 --> 07:06.880
He lives in Houston, Texas.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.920
I could hop over there and say hi to Buddy Quaid.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.000
I bet he's not verified on Twitter either.

07:13.040 --> 07:13.680
Brothers.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.360
Do you know what today is?

07:15.360 --> 07:17.280
Actually what I thought everyone's going to point out.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.080
What's that?

07:18.080 --> 07:20.960
It's April 11th, 2016.

07:20.960 --> 07:21.680
Oh shit.

07:21.680 --> 07:25.840
That means that today is the six year anniversary of my brother,

07:25.840 --> 07:28.720
my brother, me, which is what our intro is about.

07:28.720 --> 07:33.840
Can I just say, can I just say six years and we're almost at 300 episodes.

07:33.840 --> 07:37.920
That's a fucking good track record fans out there listening.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.640
That's a solid 50 episodes a year.

07:40.640 --> 07:41.040
Yeah.

07:41.040 --> 07:41.280
Yeah.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.880
That's a really great average.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.640
It's also important that I point out that Randy Quaid has a sister named Brandy Quaid.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.440
That's also true.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.080
No.

07:48.080 --> 07:48.240
Yeah.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.760
There's a Brandy Quaid out there.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.360
Is there a Denise Quaid?

07:51.360 --> 07:52.560
No, that would be funny though.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.240
That would be funny.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.360
A Randy with an I.

07:55.360 --> 07:55.680
Okay.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.280
Listen, I live in a small apartment complex.

07:59.280 --> 08:06.640
We recently got some, I'm always nervous joking about Randy Quaid because I'm worried, you know?

08:06.640 --> 08:07.280
Oh yeah.

08:07.280 --> 08:07.520
Yeah.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.240
You say, Justin, Justin, Justin, say no more.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.360
I think we all get it.

08:13.360 --> 08:18.640
Yeah, I usually check the time between recording and publish and run some stats.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.240
Like, I don't know.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.200
I don't know.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.240
I live in and manage a small apartment complex.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.480
We recently got some new tenants downstairs.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.360
They seem like a lovely couple with little to no baggage.

08:29.360 --> 08:34.480
Well, yesterday I got a text from them asking if we could share our wifi with them as they move in.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.160
They, you gave your number to them that quick?

08:38.160 --> 08:39.280
That seems a little wild to me.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.440
Well, they manage the apartment complex.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.880
So they're like the super manager thing.

08:44.880 --> 08:45.600
Thank you, Travis.

08:46.320 --> 08:50.720
They said they'd be willing to pay for their use of the bill until they get their own service.

08:50.720 --> 08:55.360
I trust they aren't a husband and wife duo of hackers looking for some sweet ISP to siphon.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.720
But that doesn't mean I have to give up my wifi that just anybody does it.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.680
Should I bite the bullet, be neighborly and give them access?

09:01.680 --> 09:04.160
Are they coveting their neighbor's wifi?

09:04.160 --> 09:05.040
That's from Gmail.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.000
This is unthinkable.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.520
This is completely unconscionable, unthinkable and unforgivable.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.760
It's unforgivable that they've even asked for it.

09:13.760 --> 09:14.400
Because guess what?

09:14.400 --> 09:16.400
It's 2016, we live on the web now.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.520
I have two virtual reality helmets in my house.

09:19.520 --> 09:23.120
I have one and a half feet in the virtual world now.

09:23.120 --> 09:26.720
And I only have like two little toes is still in the meat space.

09:26.720 --> 09:29.760
I am a virtual, I'm for all intents and purposes, a virtual being.

09:29.760 --> 09:34.000
I've converted all my money over to Bitcoin so the fucking tax man can't get his fucking

09:34.000 --> 09:35.520
grubby hands on it anymore.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.480
And you have just been like, these people, essentially, if they asked me this, they'd

09:38.480 --> 09:42.240
be like, hey Griffin, can we have unfettered access to all your shit?

09:42.240 --> 09:43.920
Can we have unfettered access to your Bitcoin?

09:43.920 --> 09:46.640
Can we show up naked in your virtual danger room?

09:47.440 --> 09:53.200
We live in a world in which when I moved to LA for a month, I was able to power the wifi

09:53.200 --> 09:57.040
of my computer through the cell service of my phone.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.760
Like this is Star Trek shit.

09:59.760 --> 10:02.880
Like I know like this.

10:02.880 --> 10:07.120
No, like this, they don't need to borrow a cup of sugar.

10:07.120 --> 10:10.560
Like they need to borrow a cup of your social security number.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.160
And also they're going to get deep into your fucking VR presence and they're going to get

10:14.160 --> 10:16.000
in your face when you least expect it.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.880
And then if you die, if you die in virtual reality, you die in real life.

10:18.880 --> 10:19.440
That's true.

10:19.440 --> 10:23.040
The first thing I thought when I read this question is do it and then just change your

10:23.040 --> 10:26.000
password on your wifi once.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.880
But but that's the practical answer.

10:28.880 --> 10:36.240
And the real answer is I would rather share my clothes with someone than I would my wifi.

10:36.240 --> 10:36.800
Imagine it.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.560
Try to imagine in the future.

10:38.560 --> 10:39.440
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.160
I'm so sorry.

10:40.160 --> 10:40.880
My wifi.

10:42.880 --> 10:43.520
Got it.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.240
Perfect.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.800
Imagine it's like try to look in the future a little bit.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.480
You hear a knock on the door, knock, knock, knock.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.120
They open it up.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.080
It's the hyper cops arriving at the scene of the crime.

10:52.080 --> 10:57.840
Now, hyper cops, cops, of course, in this case is an acronym for cyber operatives,

10:57.840 --> 10:59.840
policing, cyberspace with an S.

11:00.480 --> 11:05.520
And they show up and they're like, so just to be clear here,

11:08.080 --> 11:09.360
just to be clear, Mr.

11:09.360 --> 11:14.720
Paulson, you're telling me that you gave them access to your wifi signal.

11:14.720 --> 11:15.280
And if a hyper cop-

11:15.280 --> 11:16.000
Yeah, that makes sense.

11:16.000 --> 11:16.720
That makes sense.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.240
Just one more question.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.120
One more question.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.880
How did you hack into the US Treasury Department?

11:22.880 --> 11:24.960
Like you're you are culpable.

11:24.960 --> 11:30.480
And if you say you opened the gates to them, you are you are basically like type.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.520
They're typing with your hands, basically, is what I'm saying.

11:34.560 --> 11:39.200
Like no cop is ever going to believe that you just gave someone access to your wifi

11:39.200 --> 11:40.960
and you weren't in on it.

11:40.960 --> 11:45.840
Like, why would you do that if you weren't also hacking the WhiteHouse.gov site?

11:46.560 --> 11:48.320
Is that where they keep all the secrets?

11:48.320 --> 11:48.960
Yes, Travis.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.240
That's where they keep the secrets, yeah.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.280
I think you can set up guest networks.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.120
Next question.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.760
Yeah, but even then, they're going to have probably the same ISP.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.560
I'm not going to risk anything because I'm pretty sure if somebody can-

12:00.560 --> 12:00.960
That's true.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.680
If somebody connects to your wifi account,

12:04.320 --> 12:08.080
then I'm pretty sure they're just like five to six clicks away from being able to like scope

12:08.080 --> 12:10.160
your zone through your webcam.

12:10.160 --> 12:10.960
Definitely.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.160
That's probably true.

12:12.160 --> 12:16.400
And also like how long, like two, three weeks tops,

12:16.400 --> 12:19.680
they got to go without wifi before they get that shit set up.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.200
Like, they have smartphones.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.640
It's 2016.

12:24.640 --> 12:28.080
If they're worried enough about wifi to contact their super about it

12:28.080 --> 12:31.280
and ask if they can use yours, they have smartphones.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.400
Think about this from the other perspective though.

12:34.400 --> 12:38.480
Imagine you're these tenants and you ask your landlord if you could use their wifi

12:38.480 --> 12:41.120
and they're like, uh, absolutely not.

12:41.120 --> 12:41.600
No.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.160
You are going to think some dark shit is occurring there.

12:44.160 --> 12:45.520
No, this is all you say, Juice.

12:45.520 --> 12:49.040
You just say, you know, actually our wifi is not that fat.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.040
Like we pay, we don't have very fast wifi.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.760
So like we don't really have the bandwidth to spare.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.800
And you kind of shrug your shoulders and kind of chuckle your own joke

12:56.800 --> 12:58.640
and then just close the door.

12:58.640 --> 12:59.920
Also, just one other thing.

12:59.920 --> 13:03.680
We sell bullets full of heroin on the dark web and it's cool

13:03.680 --> 13:06.480
because then you can do like one of two illegal things with it if you want.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.920
So you can actually shoot people, kill them and make them addicted to heroin.

13:09.920 --> 13:10.960
Get real fucking high.

13:12.480 --> 13:17.760
Can you imagine like moving into a place and being like checklist,

13:17.760 --> 13:23.600
like move in number two, ask other person in building if you could use their wifi.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.240
That's like, I would never do that.

13:26.960 --> 13:27.360
Never.

13:28.320 --> 13:32.240
Well, you have, I mean, all three of us have like pretty severe social anxiety

13:32.240 --> 13:35.360
that would prevent us from even like approaching a subject like that.

13:35.360 --> 13:37.920
Well, not everybody's, you know, wired like us.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.360
I guess that's true.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.760
They're mostly wireless.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.000
I'm just saying I'm in the fucking virtual zone right now.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.640
They're mostly wireless because it's wifi.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.160
No, I heard.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.000
Which means wireless fidelity, I think.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.600
We get tweets all the fucking time from people like,

13:51.600 --> 13:52.960
you missed this great joke from Travis.

13:52.960 --> 13:55.200
I want to go ahead and put my flag in this one and go ahead and say,

13:55.200 --> 13:56.080
didn't miss it.

13:56.080 --> 13:59.120
Just did not appreciate it.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.960
Did not enjoy it.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.760
They should remake High Fidelity and call it Why Fidelity.

14:03.760 --> 14:09.840
I would watch that movie where he runs like just a little like really hipster internet shop.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.040
Cyber coffee shop.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.640
That one's got me busting a gut.

14:12.640 --> 14:19.600
I only I only want to if it's if you're not listening to flack files,

14:20.240 --> 14:22.480
then hi, it's me, Jack Flack.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.120
It's pronounced gift, you idiot.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.920
I made you a spot a fly playlist.

14:27.920 --> 14:31.440
Here's the top five ways to get your girlfriend back.

14:32.320 --> 14:39.360
I only play EverQuest on an ancient RP server that I run out of my listen.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.600
Listen.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.160
Yeah.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.520
Do you want me to read a Yahoo?

14:43.520 --> 14:44.160
Oh, yeah.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.280
I guess we can.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.080
What do you want to do?

14:46.080 --> 14:46.720
What do you guys want to do?

14:46.720 --> 14:47.600
I'm going to read this six years.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.480
I'm going to read this one.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.520
And as just as a little six year present to myself.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.000
It's sent in by Yajur Jujur Davenport.

14:54.000 --> 14:54.320
Thank you.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.440
Drew in the game.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.720
Six years running probably.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.720
I forget when he came in the game, but it's pretty early in there.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.880
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

15:01.920 --> 15:02.480
Please load.

15:02.480 --> 15:03.760
Please, please, please, please, God.

15:03.760 --> 15:04.560
Please, God, load.

15:04.560 --> 15:04.960
Nope.

15:04.960 --> 15:05.440
Not going to load.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.640
Someone's using your Wi-Fi.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.080
Don't even joke about that.

15:08.080 --> 15:15.120
Muffin says, I need some facts on Mario Lopez.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.000
Help, please.

15:17.200 --> 15:23.440
I need a lot of basic facts about Mario Lopez stared on Saved by the Belt.

15:23.440 --> 15:24.400
Please help.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.680
Some questions.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.240
One, family background, like the origin.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.320
Two, biography of him.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.160
The second point is literally everything.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.440
Literally all the information.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.840
Literally all the information that exists of him.

15:37.840 --> 15:38.880
Three, birth date.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.600
Four, where he was born.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.240
Five, where he lives and any others you can think of.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.360
And if you may, can you please include the information on where you found him?

15:49.360 --> 15:50.560
Thank you so much.

15:50.560 --> 15:57.360
This is a person that like not only knows the internet exists, but uses Yahoo Answers,

15:57.360 --> 16:02.400
but doesn't use the internet to just like Google like Mario Lopez.

16:02.400 --> 16:06.880
Okay, but in their defense, Mario Lopez keeps a pretty fucking low profile, doesn't he?

16:06.880 --> 16:10.320
He works hard to keep his name off that front page of Google.

16:12.720 --> 16:13.760
I mean, there are a few.

16:16.160 --> 16:20.160
Maybe they work in a Mario Lopez free workplace.

16:20.160 --> 16:23.040
Oh, that would be the worst.

16:23.040 --> 16:26.960
50 interesting facts about Mario Lopez.

16:26.960 --> 16:27.920
Well, let's, I think.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.080
Everybody fucking strap in.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.680
He's reading all 50.

16:31.680 --> 16:35.520
Well, he was born on October 10th, 1973.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.360
He's a baby.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.640
I was going to say he's way older than I thought.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.720
He looks perfect.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.200
He was born with three dicks.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.120
Whoa, these facts are crazy, Travis.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.320
I'm also reading them.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.840
Definitely the same ones you were reading.

16:49.840 --> 16:55.840
According to Mario Lopez, his first kiss was with Fergie when they were both on Kids Incorporated.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.120
Here's just the next fact in the same list.

16:59.120 --> 17:03.600
According to Mario Lopez, he's the only man to ever have two first kisses.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.760
Sorry, I misread it there in the middle, but that's weird.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.480
How do you have two first kisses?

17:09.440 --> 17:14.160
My first kiss was Mario and Lopez and Fergie watching Kids Incorporated,

17:14.160 --> 17:15.760
and I was kissing the TV screen.

17:15.760 --> 17:16.720
It was both of them.

17:16.720 --> 17:17.200
That's fun.

17:18.480 --> 17:22.400
That's a fun kind of thing, because it didn't happen.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.400
But this is kind of a fun thing to say, isn't it?

17:25.520 --> 17:26.880
It's kind of just silly.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.680
If you imagine kissing the TV and it's the two of them,

17:29.680 --> 17:31.120
it's kind of playing off what Travis said.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.640
It's kind of a silly thing to say.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.560
It's like a silly little guy.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.080
Number 14.

17:37.200 --> 17:41.920
Mario Lopez has a sandwich named after him at the Quiznos in Long Beach.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.120
It's a turkey club.

17:45.280 --> 17:46.080
Now hold on.

17:46.960 --> 17:50.640
You can't just call a turkey club the Mario Lopez.

17:50.640 --> 17:51.360
Yeah, that's not...

17:52.000 --> 17:53.360
It's already got a name.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.560
A turkey club.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.760
This is my signature sandwich, the peanut butter and Justin.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.120
It's peanut butter and jelly.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.640
Wouldn't it be great if Mario Lopez had never been in that Quiznos

18:02.640 --> 18:07.040
and it was just an aspirational naming of a sandwich?

18:07.040 --> 18:12.080
Like, he'll come once he finds out about the Mario Lopez.

18:12.880 --> 18:16.960
I'm reading here that the character of Super Mario is named after Mario Lopez,

18:16.960 --> 18:17.520
which is weird.

18:17.520 --> 18:18.800
I'm not exactly sure how...

18:19.440 --> 18:24.000
Was Shigeru Miyamoto a big fan of Stay by the Bell?

18:24.000 --> 18:24.800
Maybe.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.160
It would explain a lot, wouldn't it?

18:28.880 --> 18:32.960
Mario has an impressive physique and he says he never drinks soda.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.920
I love that I had to put that first part in there.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.560
Mario Lopez, he's got a fucking sexy body.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.480
Now you know that because the internet told you that

18:42.480 --> 18:44.560
and you just didn't look at him fucking ever.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.320
You won't catch Mario walking under a ladder.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.560
He's very superstitious.

18:50.560 --> 18:55.840
Like, Mario Lopez has like swung Tarzan-like vine to vine

18:55.840 --> 19:00.080
from Kids Incorporated to Stay by the Bell

19:00.080 --> 19:03.120
to fucking doing whatever he wants on TV

19:03.120 --> 19:06.160
and being basically everywhere and looking amazing

19:06.160 --> 19:08.240
despite the fact that he's 73 years old.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.000
Like, I'd be pretty superstitious too.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.280
Like, I will do whatever it takes to not upset the karmic apple cart

19:13.280 --> 19:14.960
that I'm apparently riding an eye in.

19:14.960 --> 19:19.680
Lopez once admitted to having sex on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.800
That's a long, this is a quote, that's a long ride, by the way.

19:22.800 --> 19:23.920
It's very dark.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.320
Hopefully I'll get the raft named after me.

19:26.320 --> 19:29.520
Hey dog, I've been on Pirates of the Caribbean

19:29.520 --> 19:33.040
and like, it's pretty well lit and full of kids, you monster.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.000
It's not that long either.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.600
You're a fucking monster.

19:37.360 --> 19:41.520
You have to go, like, your foreplay has to just basically be the part

19:41.520 --> 19:46.240
where they're like, get in, get in the boat.

19:46.240 --> 19:51.840
And you're sitting on, oh, ha, ha, ha, ha.

19:51.840 --> 19:52.400
Oh, uh oh.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.120
Mario Lopez, you're a fun guy.

19:55.760 --> 19:58.560
41, he loves coffee and drinks it black.

19:58.560 --> 20:02.240
42, not surprisingly, his favorite ice cream flavor is coffee.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.600
That really could have been, they started to get,

20:05.600 --> 20:06.800
they just wanted to get to 50, huh?

20:06.800 --> 20:09.440
Yeah, they had 49 and they were like, oh shit.

20:10.480 --> 20:10.960
Shit.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.920
They were trying to beat the top 40 facts article

20:13.920 --> 20:16.640
on the internet about Mario Lopez.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.400
They probably cribbed a bunch of those too

20:18.400 --> 20:20.640
and then they just added 10 about coffee on there.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.560
Okay, wait, hold on.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.600
I'll Google Mario.

20:23.600 --> 20:28.480
Number 48, Mario Lopez wasn't on Saved by the Bell.

20:29.200 --> 20:29.360
Hey.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.440
Mario Lopez dick length.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.680
Mario penis size.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.440
Can we not?

20:38.240 --> 20:38.880
Can we not?

20:38.880 --> 20:40.160
And his big dick.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.960
Mario Lopez nude.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.080
Where are these?

20:44.080 --> 20:44.640
What are you doing?

20:44.640 --> 20:47.120
Is Mario Lopez circumcised?

20:47.120 --> 20:48.000
Travis, what are you doing?

20:48.560 --> 20:48.880
What?

20:48.880 --> 20:49.840
What are you doing, Travis?

20:49.840 --> 20:52.400
I'm just trying to get all the Mario Lopez facts

20:52.400 --> 20:53.680
that this person craves.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.800
I'm Googling Mario Lopez feet.

20:56.800 --> 20:57.360
Sorry, guys.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.000
See, Justin, you're part of the problem.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.240
What do you think his next big project will be?

21:03.200 --> 21:05.520
Okay, if you were Mario Lopez, right?

21:05.520 --> 21:10.800
And you had that Lopez heat, what would you do with it?

21:10.800 --> 21:15.600
Well, that's a great question, Travis.

21:15.600 --> 21:15.920
Me?

21:15.920 --> 21:17.440
A restaurant for dogs.

21:18.160 --> 21:18.720
Okay.

21:18.720 --> 21:21.200
And yeah, no, that makes sense.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.760
No humans allowed here.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.760
Oh, and I call it Gone to the Dogs.

21:27.120 --> 21:27.600
I might just do that.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.200
A Mario Lopez joint.

21:29.200 --> 21:29.840
Yeah.

21:29.840 --> 21:42.320
You wouldn't try to get something even Lopez adjacent in there?

21:42.320 --> 21:42.640
Nope.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.240
All the waiters will be dressed like Mario Lopez.

21:47.040 --> 21:51.520
Listeners, if you're wondering why the last 30 seconds of the show has gotten a little laggy,

21:51.520 --> 21:55.600
that's the sound of all of us trying to come up with some sort of dog-related pun

21:55.600 --> 21:59.040
for a restaurant starring Mario Lopez's Caters to Dogs.

21:59.040 --> 22:02.160
We have, as you can tell so far, been unsuccessful.

22:03.280 --> 22:03.920
Lopez?

22:03.920 --> 22:04.560
In this effort.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.080
Is there Lopez?

22:06.080 --> 22:07.040
Mario Lopez.

22:07.760 --> 22:08.480
Gone to the Dogs.

22:08.480 --> 22:09.440
This is pretty good.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.280
That's his pet story.

22:11.280 --> 22:15.200
Gone to the Dogs 2, Mario Lopez.

22:15.840 --> 22:17.840
Sequel to my last joint.

22:17.840 --> 22:24.000
Oh, it's like how Bill Murray made like a Caddyshack restaurant that was like all golf themed.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.760
Mario Lopez, his mistake was he made the dog themed restaurant first

22:27.760 --> 22:32.160
and then he spun that off into the movie Mario Lopez.

22:32.160 --> 22:37.040
What if Mario Lopez had been a dog, the movie, based on the restaurant?

22:37.040 --> 22:39.680
I don't think this needle is going to get threaded, gang.

22:40.720 --> 22:41.040
Nope.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.600
Well, listen, hey, we had a good effort and-

22:43.600 --> 22:44.960
Hello, everybody.

22:44.960 --> 22:48.240
It's me, Socrates, the inventor of jokes.

22:48.240 --> 22:52.160
And I'm here to congratulate you on finding the impossible joke.

22:52.160 --> 22:53.920
The joke that can't be told.

22:53.920 --> 22:57.680
Oh, I knew we'd just- it only took us six years.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.040
Thanks, Socrates.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.040
Thanks for letting us know now.

23:01.040 --> 23:01.840
You've worked hard.

23:01.840 --> 23:05.520
You found a lot of difficult concoctions over these past six years,

23:05.520 --> 23:10.560
but you found the two subjects that cannot be combined to create humor out of it.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.520
I'm Socrates.

23:15.280 --> 23:18.880
You can keep trying, but you're only wasting your time and the listeners time.

23:18.880 --> 23:26.400
If you're a listener right here and you are probably have already cooked up two or three hum diggers,

23:26.400 --> 23:27.840
do not fucking-

23:27.840 --> 23:29.920
No, I'm telling you, don't even tweet those shits.

23:29.920 --> 23:30.560
They suck.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.000
I'm telling you, I'm Socrates.

23:33.840 --> 23:37.040
Now, Socrates, did you discover the same combination during your time?

23:37.040 --> 23:42.160
Is that how you know that there's nothing but darkness on this path?

23:42.160 --> 23:42.480
I did.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.520
I looked into the crystal lens.

23:45.520 --> 23:49.840
I looked into the crystal lens and I saw Mario Lopez.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.680
And I was like, yes, yes, yes.

23:51.680 --> 23:55.120
Got a hand up under that toga, if you know what I mean.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.000
I masturbated to the crystal.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.640
And then I was like, what if he owned a restaurant for dogs?

24:02.640 --> 24:04.560
And everyone thought that was so whimsical.

24:04.560 --> 24:08.880
And they were all perched on the edge of their seats because I was performing at the Apollo.

24:09.520 --> 24:10.640
It was a different Apollo.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.160
It was like for the god.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.640
And anyway, I just couldn't do it.

24:14.640 --> 24:16.000
Just couldn't get, couldn't-

24:16.000 --> 24:17.840
Is that why you got poisoned?

24:17.840 --> 24:18.720
Sorry?

24:18.720 --> 24:20.000
Is that why you got poisoned?

24:20.000 --> 24:20.880
Was that you?

24:20.880 --> 24:21.520
Yeah, that was me.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.120
They killed me right there on the spot.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.880
And that's where the term to die on stage came from.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.400
But I died happy, didn't I?

24:28.400 --> 24:29.840
Looking at Mario Lopez.

24:30.560 --> 24:31.840
So wait, you're looking at it.

24:31.840 --> 24:32.720
Let me get this straight.

24:32.720 --> 24:36.160
You're looking at a lens of Mario Lopez in front of people beating it.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.200
The crystal lens.

24:39.360 --> 24:43.760
You were already on some fucking Andy Kaufman experimental comedy shit, huh?

24:43.760 --> 24:46.080
Bros, this was like either Rome or Greece.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.320
I'm not sure sort of when I operated.

24:48.320 --> 24:52.160
But anyway, yeah, that's like sort of common procedure.

24:52.160 --> 24:57.360
You're not enjoying a good sporting event or a good joke or a wedding or a bar mitzvah.

24:57.360 --> 24:59.200
Nope, we probably didn't have those back then.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.880
But anyway, yeah, I was having myself a good old toga tongue.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.440
That's why you had the togas in the first place, right?

25:07.440 --> 25:08.560
Yes!

25:08.560 --> 25:09.440
Now you're getting it.

25:10.800 --> 25:11.280
Am I?

25:11.280 --> 25:11.780
Am I?

25:13.200 --> 25:16.320
Well, Socrates, thank you so much for coming by and saving us the trouble.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.400
We would have just kept bashing our heads against this thing.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.680
Yeah, nobody wants to hear that.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.560
I'm actually speaking to you through the crystal now.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.560
Before I died.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.000
Oh shit, that's a paradox.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.040
Oh shit!

25:27.040 --> 25:27.440
That's weird.

25:27.440 --> 25:30.400
His apparition just like deleted itself from-

25:30.400 --> 25:31.040
That was weird.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.680
Just like barkio Lopez?

25:33.680 --> 25:34.640
Is that like a thing?

25:34.640 --> 25:35.200
Is that-

25:35.200 --> 25:35.700
No.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.960
Hey, I'm back!

25:36.960 --> 25:37.600
Oh shit!

25:37.600 --> 25:38.400
Oh my god!

25:38.400 --> 25:40.640
Oh my god! All my hypotheses!

25:41.200 --> 25:41.840
They're ruined!

25:44.320 --> 25:45.520
This changes everything!

25:47.040 --> 25:48.720
Just barkio Lopez?

25:48.720 --> 25:50.560
We're gonna enter into like universe B.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.520
All right, well, next question.

25:56.240 --> 25:56.880
Here it comes.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.960
Man, I googled so many things in the last five minutes.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.360
I need to close them before the FBI sweeps in.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.880
I mean, I googled when will Mario Lopez die?

26:06.880 --> 26:09.440
And I feel like that put me on a very short watch list.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.200
It's just me and Mark Paul Gosler.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.440
Okay, I live it.

26:15.440 --> 26:19.280
Okay, my boyfriend and I go out on a very regular basis.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.680
So we spend a decent amount of time in the car together.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.560
I like to listen to music during transit and I love to sing along to songs.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.000
My boyfriend will constantly ask me a question or try to talk to me

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
in the middle of a song I love to jam to.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.880
I've told him I find this frustrating, but he still does it.

26:32.880 --> 26:37.680
Am I wrong to want him to wait until the end of a song for a chat?

26:37.680 --> 26:39.280
And that's cranky co-pilot.

26:40.720 --> 26:41.840
This is the weirdest.

26:44.480 --> 26:47.120
I'm imagining like me and one of you guys in the car

26:47.120 --> 26:49.040
and just like one week just came on and I'm like,

26:49.040 --> 26:51.680
time to show off my rap skills.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.680
Chickity China, the Chinese.

26:53.680 --> 26:54.960
And then like one of you is like,

26:54.960 --> 26:57.120
hey, did you see the new Star Wars trailer?

26:57.120 --> 26:57.920
Like in the middle,

26:57.920 --> 27:00.720
like while I'm in the middle of busting out those fucking raps,

27:00.720 --> 27:04.000
do you know how angry I'd be?

27:04.000 --> 27:08.480
Car singing is the most intimate personal like thing

27:08.480 --> 27:12.560
you could possibly do that doesn't involve a toga.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.440
And I don't know why you would do that with another person in the car.

27:15.440 --> 27:16.320
There are two reasons.

27:16.320 --> 27:16.880
It's simply not done.

27:16.880 --> 27:17.600
There are two reasons.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.880
The center will not hold.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.960
The two reasons are one for comic effect.

27:21.520 --> 27:25.840
Like you saying very like way too intensely to someone

27:25.840 --> 27:28.080
or you saying the words wrong on purpose.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.320
Like that's pretty funny.

27:30.320 --> 27:35.280
Jesus, we are just putting on a fucking workshop today, aren't we boys?

27:35.920 --> 27:38.880
We're just putting on a fucking laugh clinic.

27:39.840 --> 27:44.160
For example, my favorite one to do it for is that one song about like,

27:44.960 --> 27:47.920
cause I like you, I like you.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.520
But instead I sing, put your makeup on, take it off,

27:51.520 --> 27:53.440
put it on again, try again.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.200
Now some more, a little more makeup.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.240
Okay, that's great.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.720
And it's pretty funny.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.920
Yeah, I bet it would be if I knew like what the fuck you were talking about.

28:01.920 --> 28:04.160
I believe it's Colby Callie.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.840
And then the other reason is if it is a musical number that is a duet.

28:11.200 --> 28:19.840
So maybe your boyfriend doesn't get that he's supposed to join you in on the song.

28:19.840 --> 28:23.760
So what you need to do is stop and throw it off to him

28:23.760 --> 28:26.160
and just be like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

28:26.160 --> 28:26.960
Now you!

28:26.960 --> 28:30.560
And like give him like the two points, throw it off to him

28:30.560 --> 28:32.720
and get him involved in the song.

28:33.840 --> 28:37.680
You could sing like you're just mid-island in the stream

28:37.680 --> 28:40.000
and you're just like, and ladies and gentlemen,

28:40.000 --> 28:44.480
please welcome to the stage of the Sahara, Mr. Dillon.

28:45.280 --> 28:46.880
And then just wait for Dylan to pick it up.

28:46.880 --> 28:47.680
That would be aw-

28:47.680 --> 28:53.840
If someone did it to me, I would feel so cool for like five seconds.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.760
That it took you to realize you don't know the lyrics.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.440
Yeah, nobody knows any of the fucking words.

28:58.960 --> 29:00.640
Islands in the stream.

29:00.640 --> 29:01.840
The stream.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.520
That is what you are.

29:03.520 --> 29:04.480
That is what you are.

29:04.480 --> 29:04.880
Is that right?

29:04.880 --> 29:05.440
Chasing waterfalls.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.000
I don't actually-

29:06.000 --> 29:07.200
I can't actually-

29:07.200 --> 29:08.720
Like a superstar.

29:08.720 --> 29:09.760
And we're fishing now.

29:09.760 --> 29:13.920
Come away with me to the island island stream.

29:13.920 --> 29:17.120
That's actually what most people don't know,

29:17.120 --> 29:20.720
is they're actually concurrent lyrics to islands in the stream.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.000
Both of us are correct.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.200
I wish I'd been with Jimmy Buff the first time

29:25.200 --> 29:26.400
we heard that fucking song.

29:26.400 --> 29:26.960
And he was like-

29:26.960 --> 29:27.840
Motherfucker!

29:27.840 --> 29:28.560
What are you, why?

29:29.360 --> 29:29.760
Why, Justin?

29:29.760 --> 29:31.040
Like how did I not write this?

29:33.600 --> 29:35.680
He doesn't seem, and now island definitely,

29:35.680 --> 29:39.680
but he doesn't seem like a stream based performer to me.

29:40.400 --> 29:41.840
Like islands in the bay.

29:41.840 --> 29:46.400
Yeah, he doesn't like bodies of water that are landlocked.

29:46.400 --> 29:46.720
Yeah.

29:46.720 --> 29:47.440
Nobody knows that.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.600
I don't, I think, I gotta be honest.

29:51.600 --> 29:55.920
I hate to like, I just think it's kind of rude.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.120
I think it's a little rude.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.280
To sing or to interrupt the song?

29:59.280 --> 30:01.840
To sing with somebody else in the car

30:01.840 --> 30:02.880
when they're trying to like,

30:04.560 --> 30:06.080
you're in a relationship with somebody,

30:06.800 --> 30:07.840
no one's ever been like,

30:09.440 --> 30:11.520
listen, I knew the day I wanted to marry you

30:11.520 --> 30:15.920
is because I never wanted to hear SWV's week,

30:15.920 --> 30:17.440
that's Sisters of Voices.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.720
I never wanted to hear that without you on the track.

30:20.720 --> 30:21.520
And that's how I knew,

30:21.520 --> 30:23.760
like you get together with somebody

30:23.760 --> 30:26.320
so you can like talk to them and spend time with them.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.640
And if like you're both singing a song that you like,

30:28.640 --> 30:29.360
that's one thing.

30:29.360 --> 30:32.560
But like, if you're just putting on a little personal concert

30:32.560 --> 30:34.560
for somebody who's trying to operate a motor vehicle,

30:34.560 --> 30:37.520
like how would you feel if like mid concert,

30:37.520 --> 30:39.520
they just slipped earbuds in their ears

30:39.520 --> 30:41.120
that they started listening to a podcast?

30:41.120 --> 30:42.880
Like that'd be pretty savage.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.400
That's kind of what you're doing to them.

30:44.400 --> 30:48.480
This question asker is definitely asking,

30:49.200 --> 30:52.320
like has asked the boyfriend not to do it anymore.

30:52.320 --> 30:53.760
Oh, then you just seem to give indicates,

30:53.760 --> 30:55.040
song comes on, you crank it up,

30:55.040 --> 30:55.840
you look at him and go,

30:55.840 --> 30:58.640
I'm gonna sing now, talk to me after the song.

30:58.640 --> 31:01.280
And you just go, communication just right there.

31:01.280 --> 31:02.720
What is he supposed to do?

31:03.600 --> 31:05.440
What does he do for the next three minutes?

31:05.440 --> 31:08.800
It listens and enjoys, listens and enjoys.

31:08.800 --> 31:13.840
Claps like a 10 year old, 15th century Lord.

31:13.840 --> 31:16.320
Just like, yeah, it stands for me, Jester.

31:16.320 --> 31:19.040
That's what you look for in any partner.

31:19.040 --> 31:22.240
I think the ability to enjoy you in a childlike manner.

31:22.240 --> 31:25.360
I can see a situation where I would be the singer

31:25.360 --> 31:26.720
and I would get worried

31:27.840 --> 31:30.160
about their non-participation in the song.

31:30.800 --> 31:34.320
And like, if John Michael Montgomery's

31:34.320 --> 31:36.400
sold the Grunty County auction came on,

31:36.400 --> 31:39.040
and then I, of course, I'm gonna.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.280
Hey pretty lady, won't you give me a sign?

31:41.280 --> 31:42.800
Give me a sign, I'll do anything.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.600
Of course I'm gonna like.

31:43.600 --> 31:44.640
I thought we were gonna burn it down.

31:44.640 --> 31:44.960
Oh, yeah.

31:44.960 --> 31:47.200
We've done this six years, have we not earned?

31:47.200 --> 31:48.320
One fucking job.

31:48.320 --> 31:51.280
I went down to the Grunty County auction.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.960
I saw something I just had to have.

31:52.960 --> 31:54.400
I can't, we gotta pay Bryce.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.200
My mind told me I should proceed with caution,

31:57.200 --> 31:59.600
but my heart said go ahead and make a bid on that.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.600
He did a lot of research into auctions.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.320
I said, hey pretty lady, won't you give me a sign?

32:04.320 --> 32:06.320
Oh, that's good, no, I'm definitely not gonna sink you guys.

32:06.320 --> 32:09.760
So this is gonna be like, oh, good, good, good.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.640
I've never seen anyone, never seen anyone looking so,

32:12.640 --> 32:15.440
never seen any, never seen anyone, never seen,

32:15.440 --> 32:16.720
never seen any, never seen.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.840
We're just gonna duplicate it so there's 19 of us.

32:19.840 --> 32:21.600
All just different parts of the song.

32:21.600 --> 32:22.800
It's a round.

32:22.800 --> 32:23.920
Blonde hair, blue eyes.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.480
Give me a little sign, gotta have her,

32:26.480 --> 32:29.440
she's one of a kind, about to bid my heart goodbye.

32:29.440 --> 32:32.320
Going twice, I'm sold to the lady in the, give me a sign.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.320
That's what you guys fucking sound like.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.960
She said, I don't know, I think you were just.

32:36.960 --> 32:40.000
Well, I went down to the Grundy County, give me a sign.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.800
That's you guys doing a little live remix.

32:43.680 --> 32:44.720
Should I get my guitar?

32:44.720 --> 32:45.360
Let me grab my guitar.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.120
No, no, no, hey, juice, juice, juice, juice, juice, juice.

32:47.120 --> 32:48.480
Real quick, juice, real quick, before you do that.

32:49.360 --> 32:49.860
Yeah.

32:51.440 --> 32:52.560
Do you guys want a different yahoo?

32:52.560 --> 32:53.920
Should we go to the Money Zone?

32:53.920 --> 32:57.840
Money Zone, and here's an instrumental musical vocal

32:58.800 --> 33:00.720
transition into the Money Zone.

33:00.720 --> 33:04.400
It's the Grundy County Auction by us.

33:04.400 --> 33:07.520
We recorded it afterwards in a professional studio,

33:07.520 --> 33:09.200
and it sounds really good,

33:09.200 --> 33:11.120
and I'm gonna play for you right now.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.480
You wear underwear every single day.

33:24.480 --> 33:25.440
On my butt, that's true.

33:26.080 --> 33:28.640
Well, hold on, maybe you do, maybe you don't.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.480
No, you probably do.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.160
Statistically, you do.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.480
Sometimes I wear, sometimes if there's a bad storm outside,

33:34.480 --> 33:35.440
I'll wear a thunder wear.

33:36.160 --> 33:36.800
Nice.

33:36.800 --> 33:37.760
When you're wearing a suit-

33:37.760 --> 33:41.040
Sometimes, if I'm very curious, I'll wear wonder wear.

33:41.040 --> 33:43.440
If I'm feeling really religious, nunder wear.

33:43.440 --> 33:44.160
That's good.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.120
If I'm feeling like making some word jokes, punder wear.

33:47.120 --> 33:47.760
Okay, so-

33:48.480 --> 33:51.120
If it's the first day of the work week, munder wear.

33:51.920 --> 33:54.080
I'm not gonna let you motherfuckers Dan McCoy me

33:54.080 --> 33:55.440
through this advertising break.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.200
You're just gonna have to just do yourself.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.800
I feel like I've got two more.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.640
If I'm in middle school-

34:00.640 --> 34:02.320
Fine, I'm over here, I'm done, I'm out.

34:03.040 --> 34:04.720
If I'm in middle school,

34:04.720 --> 34:07.760
and I see something even remotely sexy, cunder wear.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.120
Nice, okay.

34:10.160 --> 34:12.640
If I'm planning on a day on the beach, sunder wear.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.280
Or, also concurrently,

34:15.280 --> 34:18.080
if I'm planning on ripping things apart, sunder wear.

34:18.720 --> 34:19.840
That's pretty good.

34:19.840 --> 34:20.320
I'm done.

34:21.680 --> 34:23.520
Oh, if I'm about to go jogging, runder wear.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.400
Okay, so let's do it.

34:24.960 --> 34:25.680
I'm done, done.

34:25.680 --> 34:26.880
Go ahead, go for a juice.

34:26.880 --> 34:29.200
What if you're trying to catch sharks

34:29.200 --> 34:31.280
with putting a lot of blood in the water?

34:31.280 --> 34:32.320
Oh, chumder wear.

34:33.120 --> 34:33.600
There you go.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.800
Mionis are the most comfortable underwear you can wear.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.680
And that's what this company is dedicated to making.

34:39.680 --> 34:42.560
They're made from sustainably sourced modal.

34:42.560 --> 34:44.800
So, a few years from now,

34:44.800 --> 34:47.280
your children will be able to enjoy watching modals

34:47.280 --> 34:48.560
frolic through the trees.

34:48.560 --> 34:52.640
Used to be to get one pair, you would kill a whole modal.

34:52.640 --> 34:55.840
And you'd only use like 5% of it,

34:55.840 --> 34:58.640
and you'd throw the rest right down into the modal well.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.000
But they use every part of the modal now.

35:02.000 --> 35:02.480
Yeah.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.640
Yeah, it's twice as soft as cotton,

35:04.640 --> 35:07.280
and nothing really describes the fit and feel of these

35:07.280 --> 35:11.040
until you put them on your jinnies yourself.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.800
Shipping is free in the US and Canada,

35:12.800 --> 35:15.440
and you can save $8 a pair

35:15.440 --> 35:17.760
with the Mionis subscription plan.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.680
You can get the subscription or a single pair.

35:19.680 --> 35:22.400
Either way, you get 20% off your first order

35:22.400 --> 35:26.560
when you go to meundies.com slash my brother.

35:26.560 --> 35:29.040
You're gonna adore these underwear.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.280
So listen, if you wear glasses, sure, we all do.

35:33.280 --> 35:36.000
Hi, I'm Travis McElroy, the spectacle gentleman.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.960
If you wear glasses, then you know

35:38.960 --> 35:41.760
glasses are just an unavoidable part of life.

35:41.760 --> 35:42.960
Try not wearing them.

35:42.960 --> 35:43.920
Just try it.

35:43.920 --> 35:44.560
You can't.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.320
There are lots of people who like don't,

35:46.320 --> 35:46.720
like they're-

35:46.720 --> 35:48.000
You have garbage eyes.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.560
Your eyes are made of garbage and you can't see shit.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.680
What are you gonna do?

35:51.680 --> 35:56.080
Go to some box glasses store and pay way too much?

35:56.080 --> 35:58.160
No, that would be dumb, and you're not dummy.

35:58.160 --> 36:00.160
You wear glasses like a smart person.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.640
What you're gonna do is you're gonna go to Warby Parker.

36:02.640 --> 36:05.440
You're gonna get contemporary prescription glasses

36:05.440 --> 36:08.000
starting at just $95.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.920
Like if you've ever bought glasses before,

36:11.920 --> 36:14.160
you know that that is an amazing price.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.920
You can get prescription sunglasses

36:15.920 --> 36:19.600
starting at just $175, and that includes the lenses.

36:19.600 --> 36:20.320
Here's how it works.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.840
They have a home try-on program

36:21.840 --> 36:23.440
where you order five pairs of glasses.

36:23.440 --> 36:24.720
They ship directly to you.

36:24.720 --> 36:25.680
That's for free.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.120
You try on all the frames.

36:27.120 --> 36:27.920
You get a feel for them.

36:27.920 --> 36:28.880
You actually get to look at them.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.880
People get to look at you and say, that's great.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.720
You get five pairs for five days,

36:32.720 --> 36:35.440
and then you mail back the ones that you don't want.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.200
You only keep the ones that you want.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.840
It's an amazing system, and it really works.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.920
You go to warbyparker.com.

36:41.920 --> 36:48.320
That's W-A-R-B-Y-P-A-R-K-E-R.com slash my brother,

36:49.200 --> 36:52.720

36:52.720 --> 36:55.200

36:57.440 --> 37:00.960
you can do it by going to maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

37:00.960 --> 37:04.160
It's the place to go to wish someone happy birthday

37:04.160 --> 37:07.280
or to talk about your Etsy business,

37:07.280 --> 37:10.080
or like if your friend James is in a coma

37:10.080 --> 37:12.880
and like you want to say, James, please wake up

37:12.880 --> 37:15.520
and you want to send him a message through the Jumbotron

37:15.520 --> 37:17.120
and maybe you're fucking with him

37:17.120 --> 37:18.560
through his favorite podcast

37:18.560 --> 37:21.120
and you paid money to like have them say,

37:21.120 --> 37:22.800
James, please wake up.

37:22.800 --> 37:23.600
You can do that.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.880
Just go to maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.160
Do we have a message this week?

37:28.160 --> 37:30.640
Yeah, I got one for Clementine.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.960
It's from Aunt Jessica and it says,

37:32.960 --> 37:34.240
welcome to the world.

37:34.240 --> 37:35.920
I want your life to be filled with laughter

37:35.920 --> 37:38.880
so my bim bam greeting seems like a good place to start.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.520
I know your mom was a fan when you were in utero,

37:41.520 --> 37:44.080
so you're already prepared for a world of majestic horses,

37:44.080 --> 37:46.480
haunted dolls, and Garfield monstrosities.

37:46.480 --> 37:48.880
We're all so glad to finally have you here.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.960
So what's up, you cool baby?

37:50.960 --> 37:53.520
So, I mean, she's probably seven by now,

37:53.520 --> 37:58.560
but gosh, I'm just so happy to have Clementine

37:58.560 --> 38:01.440
here on Earth and in high school.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.800
I'm just really happy this is here.

38:02.800 --> 38:05.040
So vote Clementine, 2016.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.160
Vote Clementine.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.400
Vote Clementine.

38:08.400 --> 38:12.080
She's a mother of three and she's just doing her best to, okay.

38:12.080 --> 38:14.960
So basically, welcome to the world and also we're sorry.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.920
Yeah, welcome to Earth.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.920
You guys, I'm so excited to introduce to you

38:19.920 --> 38:22.800
my new baby, Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.560
This is gonna be a really fun look

38:24.560 --> 38:26.080
at things that I find curious,

38:26.080 --> 38:27.920
whether it's a menstrual cup,

38:27.920 --> 38:29.440
it might be the Romanov family,

38:29.440 --> 38:32.160
it might be fracking, it could be Carly Fiorina.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.520
I don't even know, who knows?

38:33.520 --> 38:34.960
It's gonna be whatever I think is interesting.

38:34.960 --> 38:37.040
I can't wait to bring it to you guys.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.560
We're gonna be bringing in content experts.

38:38.560 --> 38:40.000
I'm gonna be learning the things.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.680
It's only gonna take about 30 minutes

38:41.680 --> 38:43.840
for you to expand your baby brains with me

38:43.840 --> 38:45.120
and have a super fun time.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.240
So I can't wait to see you

38:46.240 --> 38:48.080
on our first episode of Getting Curious.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.280
I started a new job and it's been great,

38:51.920 --> 38:54.080
except one of the other employees

38:54.080 --> 38:56.560
have been trying to give me friendly warnings.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.720
Now that's in quotes,

38:58.720 --> 39:01.040
but I thought I implied it with my tone.

39:01.040 --> 39:01.600
You did great.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.400
Now I know how to do my job and no one has complained,

39:06.400 --> 39:10.720
but these warnings have gotten in my head more than once.

39:10.720 --> 39:13.360
Their latest warning just annoyed me.

39:13.360 --> 39:16.400
Quote, try not to get that done early,

39:16.400 --> 39:19.600
so you can get in trouble.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.000
What?

39:22.000 --> 39:24.560
Let me do it like I think this person did it.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.160
Try not to get that done early,

39:26.160 --> 39:27.200
you can get in trouble.

39:29.040 --> 39:30.160
What the fuck does that mean?

39:30.960 --> 39:31.200
I don't know.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.560
So brothers, how do I deal with a coworker

39:32.560 --> 39:34.000
trying to assert dominance?

39:34.000 --> 39:35.200
And that's from You're Not My Supervise.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.320
You fucking shank him.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.920
You fucking shank him right between the second

39:37.920 --> 39:38.880
and third rib.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.160
Just like give it to him right there.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.400
I wanna, okay.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.160
I side with the question asker here,

39:44.160 --> 39:46.480
but I would pose that it's possible

39:46.480 --> 39:48.640
they're not trying to assert dominance.

39:48.640 --> 39:50.880
Maybe that's 100% how they're coming across,

39:51.440 --> 39:53.440
but maybe like they consider themselves

39:53.440 --> 39:56.400
a bit of like the welcome wagon for new employees

39:56.400 --> 39:59.280
who they've really figured out how things work around.

39:59.280 --> 40:00.560
They've been around the block.

40:00.560 --> 40:03.280
They've seen new employees come and go

40:03.280 --> 40:04.560
and they've really got the lowdown

40:04.560 --> 40:06.000
and they wanna help you out,

40:06.000 --> 40:07.520
but it's coming across like,

40:08.240 --> 40:09.440
well, even as I said it,

40:09.440 --> 40:12.800
it really does like I know it and you don't,

40:12.800 --> 40:14.240
which is bullshit,

40:14.240 --> 40:18.240
but it might not be consciously as shitty as it could be.

40:19.600 --> 40:20.400
Does that make sense?

40:20.400 --> 40:22.720
Maybe they are on some level trying to help you.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.320
They're just really shitty about it.

40:24.320 --> 40:26.640
Some people actually like,

40:29.520 --> 40:33.680
some people don't have a way of communicating

40:34.400 --> 40:35.280
things about their lives

40:35.280 --> 40:38.320
or like don't have that much interesting stuff in their life

40:38.320 --> 40:41.440
or don't have much of a personality outside of their job.

40:41.440 --> 40:44.400
Like their job is the way that like they define themselves.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.640
So the way that they're trying to make a connection with you

40:46.640 --> 40:47.200
is sharing,

40:47.200 --> 40:48.320
because it's the only thing they know

40:48.320 --> 40:49.440
that you have in common.

40:49.440 --> 40:51.200
So they're trying to connect maybe with,

40:51.200 --> 40:52.800
I may be being too charitable here,

40:52.800 --> 41:00.640
but I've known people who they're so sort of embedded

41:01.280 --> 41:03.280
in their job that it's really the only thing

41:03.280 --> 41:04.320
they have to talk about.

41:04.320 --> 41:07.200
Jesus, Justin, you don't have to fucking sub tweet me.

41:07.200 --> 41:07.760
I'm right here.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.320
Yeah, I'm really obsessed with my podcast,

41:10.320 --> 41:10.960
my video output,

41:10.960 --> 41:12.400
but I'm not just one dimensional.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.840
I get out there and do lots of stuff.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.760
I go jet skiing almost every other weekend

41:16.320 --> 41:19.120
just to work on my jumps on the jet ski.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.320
But to be fair Griffin,

41:20.320 --> 41:21.840
now you've talked about it on your podcast.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.680
So now that is part of your podcast work.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.600
Son of a, oh my God.

41:29.200 --> 41:32.000
I think this person is trying to be the boss.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.480
And the only way to be the boss is to beat the boss

41:34.480 --> 41:35.440
and they're not gonna beat,

41:35.440 --> 41:37.120
they're not going to attack their boss.

41:37.120 --> 41:40.080
Do you have some kind of like boss beating strategy guide?

41:41.120 --> 41:44.400
Yeah, I posted it in Prima games,

41:44.400 --> 41:47.360
published it and it's also a boss guide

41:47.360 --> 41:49.200
for Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.120
So like, if you follow that,

41:51.120 --> 41:52.800
then you'll be able to also attack your boss

41:52.800 --> 41:54.640
and win in like a physical fight.

41:54.640 --> 41:55.840
There's a lot of crossover,

41:57.040 --> 41:58.960
just, you know, use a lightning type weapon.

42:00.240 --> 42:03.520
I think that this is like really shitty.

42:03.520 --> 42:07.120
The way that, it may just be entirely,

42:07.120 --> 42:08.080
I might just be projecting

42:08.080 --> 42:09.680
because of the tone of voice that Justin used

42:09.680 --> 42:11.120
when he said this thing

42:11.120 --> 42:13.520
or the tone of voice Travis used when he said this thing.

42:13.520 --> 42:15.920
Maybe I should direct this aggression right at Travis

42:15.920 --> 42:17.840
and maybe this is more innocuous than it sounded.

42:17.840 --> 42:19.440
But this idea of this person being like,

42:20.160 --> 42:21.680
do you try not to get that done early?

42:21.680 --> 42:23.120
You can get in trouble.

42:23.120 --> 42:25.280
That's some fucking Dorian Gray bullshit.

42:26.800 --> 42:27.520
Is that his name?

42:28.480 --> 42:30.640
Sure, it's also possible that this person

42:31.360 --> 42:33.360
isn't actually trying to help you.

42:33.360 --> 42:36.000
And by saying shit like, don't get this done early,

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
I could see a scenario where you get it done early

42:38.000 --> 42:40.480
and the boss is like, well, now I can give you more work

42:40.480 --> 42:42.880
because I know you can get it done on time.

42:42.880 --> 42:46.480
But like, I can't imagine an office scenario

42:46.480 --> 42:48.640
in which you would quote, get in trouble

42:49.360 --> 42:51.920
for completing tasks ahead of time.

42:51.920 --> 42:56.960
We need, what we need, by we, I mean humans,

42:57.920 --> 43:00.160
we need like fighting plumage.

43:00.160 --> 43:03.520
Because like, obviously you can get your body really big

43:03.520 --> 43:06.000
and you can like assert, you can reassert dominance

43:06.000 --> 43:08.160
against them by like just showing them your big muscles

43:08.160 --> 43:09.120
and like sticking out your chest

43:09.120 --> 43:13.680
and making human fighting noises like, come on, come on.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.520
That's like our like fight sound.

43:15.520 --> 43:16.720
But I'm saying like, we need something

43:16.720 --> 43:18.800
like most frogs have where they like extend

43:18.800 --> 43:20.640
their throats out real big.

43:20.640 --> 43:23.040
And you know like, oh fuck, I gotta stay away from that frog

43:23.040 --> 43:25.840
or like birds that like shake their plumage

43:25.840 --> 43:28.240
to let them know like, if you're feeling froggy

43:28.240 --> 43:29.520
then fucking jump.

43:29.520 --> 43:30.720
But we don't have that as humans.

43:30.720 --> 43:32.480
Are you pitching a scenario in which like you get

43:32.480 --> 43:34.640
your hackles up and someone's going,

43:34.640 --> 43:36.640
oh, leave him alone, he's in a bad mood

43:36.640 --> 43:39.360
or like literally like someone comes up to you

43:39.360 --> 43:40.800
and they say something shitty.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.560
Like you might get in trouble and you're like,

43:43.680 --> 43:46.240
and they're like, oh shit, it's like a dilophosaurus.

43:46.240 --> 43:47.840
We need to leave that fucker alone.

43:47.840 --> 43:51.280
I'm saying humans need neck webbing or something.

43:51.280 --> 43:51.760
Got it.

43:51.760 --> 43:52.880
That they can really just like.

43:54.880 --> 43:57.520
And it's not just for, it's just to scare somebody off.

43:57.520 --> 43:58.800
You wouldn't use it in a fighting.

43:58.800 --> 44:00.080
Would it also be for mating?

44:00.880 --> 44:02.560
Oh, fuck yeah, dude.

44:02.560 --> 44:05.760
You shake that in a certain way and it's like, all right.

44:05.760 --> 44:09.280
What if you keep your fists in satin bags?

44:09.280 --> 44:10.560
Uh-huh, okay.

44:12.560 --> 44:14.160
I'm already up for it.

44:14.160 --> 44:14.720
Reel me in.

44:14.720 --> 44:15.760
Satin bags.

44:15.760 --> 44:16.800
All right, do the satin bags.

44:16.800 --> 44:17.920
Can you describe the satin bags?

44:17.920 --> 44:19.680
Because I really need you to paint me a picture right now.

44:20.560 --> 44:24.640
Yeah, you have, they're sort of like,

44:24.640 --> 44:30.800
imagine the crown royal bag with the red satin and you slip them over your fists.

44:30.800 --> 44:37.280
And on one of them, very decorative, is embroidered the word lucky lefty.

44:37.280 --> 44:38.480
Lucky lefty.

44:38.480 --> 44:41.760
And then on the other one is embroidered the word right boy.

44:44.480 --> 44:48.800
Is it the same for all people or does everyone have their own customized specific?

44:48.800 --> 44:50.480
Same words, custom fonts.

44:50.480 --> 44:51.680
Okay, all right.

44:51.680 --> 44:54.560
Web dings, comic sans are popular options.

44:54.560 --> 44:59.440
So if somebody gets on your case and they're like giving you the business,

45:00.240 --> 45:05.040
then you just start slipping the satin bags off your fist as if it's time to say like,

45:05.680 --> 45:07.760
time for work, time to go to work.

45:09.120 --> 45:12.960
They'll get it from there because there's no reason that you would take them out of the bags.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.520
Because your fists, I mean, it's all just fists.

45:15.520 --> 45:19.040
What I love about that, Justin, is you only need to do that once

45:19.040 --> 45:22.320
to establish what it means when the bags come off.

45:22.320 --> 45:25.680
It's not like a learned behavior that you would only have to once

45:25.680 --> 45:28.640
remove the bags and punch someone and put them back on

45:28.640 --> 45:32.640
before everyone would be like, if he goes for the bag, back away.

45:32.640 --> 45:33.920
Don't break eye contact.

45:33.920 --> 45:35.040
Do not smile.

45:35.040 --> 45:36.640
That's a show of aggression.

45:36.640 --> 45:38.160
Keep your shoulders hunched.

45:38.160 --> 45:41.200
Just move away and then turn a corner as quickly as you can.

45:41.200 --> 45:44.720
This would make a bar fight way more interesting.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.000
I don't like watching people fight.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.120
Like, those videos pop up on Facebook and it's like, watch these 12 dudes knock the

45:49.120 --> 45:50.880
fuck out of each other at a baseball game.

45:51.440 --> 45:53.360
No, I don't want to watch men get hurt.

45:53.360 --> 45:54.160
No, thank you.

45:54.160 --> 45:58.480
But I would watch 12 men standing in a circle very slowly taking bags off their hands going

45:58.480 --> 46:04.240
like, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.400
Because it's the drama, it's the build up.

46:06.400 --> 46:07.840
It's the fucking drama, it's the build up.

46:07.840 --> 46:10.880
It's the Christmas Eve of the brutal attack.

46:10.880 --> 46:13.680
You know what would make human fighting so much better?

46:13.680 --> 46:20.720
So when deers, when male bucks fight, like deer, bucks, they like slam their horns together.

46:20.720 --> 46:25.920
And sometimes there's a chance that their horns become stuck together.

46:26.560 --> 46:28.080
And then they just have to kiss.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.360
That's nature looking out for itself.

46:29.360 --> 46:30.880
Like, hey, you two are beautiful.

46:30.880 --> 46:31.680
Don't fight.

46:31.680 --> 46:32.960
I'm gonna make y'all kiss instead.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.000
Clink, you're stuck.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.120
Smooch, smooch, smooch.

46:35.120 --> 46:40.080
But can you imagine if two like drunk people at a bar were like, we're gonna have to fight

46:40.080 --> 46:40.720
about this.

46:40.720 --> 46:42.240
And then they started fighting.

46:42.240 --> 46:46.160
But then by the end, like their arms were just like stuck together, like hooked together

46:46.160 --> 46:47.600
in a way that they couldn't get out.

46:47.600 --> 46:50.880
And they're like, oh, man, now we're both look like dummies.

46:50.880 --> 46:52.240
Now we're both embarrassed.

46:52.880 --> 46:56.560
And that smaller person took our drinks and we can't do shit about it.

46:57.440 --> 46:58.800
I think I like that.

46:58.800 --> 47:01.040
Something like that does happen, though, in boxing.

47:01.040 --> 47:01.440
Yeah.

47:01.440 --> 47:07.440
Sometimes the boxers will get into like, they'll be so exhausted.

47:07.440 --> 47:07.920
Uh-huh.

47:07.920 --> 47:08.640
That they'll kiss?

47:08.640 --> 47:13.280
That they'll like, no, they'll just like wrap each other up and stand there for a second.

47:13.280 --> 47:16.320
And it's like, it's beautiful because it's both of them saying.

47:16.320 --> 47:16.960
I want to fight.

47:16.960 --> 47:19.920
I want to punch you so bad, but I'm so sleepy.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.120
I want to punch you more.

47:21.120 --> 47:24.320
But I'm so, one of them just whispers in the other's ear.

47:24.320 --> 47:25.760
First of all, I am tired.

47:26.400 --> 47:27.360
I am true of heart.

47:27.360 --> 47:30.240
And the other one whispers back, you are tired.

47:30.240 --> 47:31.280
You are true of heart.

47:31.280 --> 47:34.240
It's like this moment where they're both very human.

47:34.240 --> 47:34.480
Yeah.

47:34.480 --> 47:34.960
You know what I mean?

47:34.960 --> 47:38.720
Like it's very, they're very connected to each other and everything.

47:38.720 --> 47:40.320
Just the whole thing, you know?

47:40.320 --> 47:43.040
And then another one gets so angry.

47:43.040 --> 47:43.280
Yeah.

47:43.280 --> 47:45.040
That they let themselves become so vulnerable.

47:45.040 --> 47:45.280
Yeah.

47:45.280 --> 47:46.800
Using the energy to finish the fight.

47:46.800 --> 47:50.480
I think that's why it would be nice if you gave boxers like the chance to ring their

47:50.480 --> 47:52.480
own bell when they need a break.

47:52.480 --> 47:52.800
Yeah.

47:52.800 --> 47:55.280
Like they hug and they're like, do you want to take a break?

47:55.280 --> 47:56.960
We'll sit down on our stools.

47:56.960 --> 48:01.200
Someone will cut us and put like a cold quarter on our face or something.

48:01.200 --> 48:04.800
Or on the flip side, it's just like, I'm just going to stand here and hug

48:04.800 --> 48:05.920
you and take a nap.

48:05.920 --> 48:08.000
Because I don't want the man to cut my face anymore.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.560
And as long as I'm in here, I'm safe from the cutting man.

48:10.560 --> 48:11.600
You lean against me.

48:11.600 --> 48:12.720
I lean against you.

48:12.720 --> 48:15.040
And neither one of us has to sleep with our heads in the way.

48:15.040 --> 48:15.920
You know what I mean?

48:15.920 --> 48:16.400
Hey, man.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.480
I also am very afraid of the cutting man.

48:18.480 --> 48:18.960
Oh, good.

48:18.960 --> 48:19.760
I thought it was just me.

48:19.760 --> 48:20.160
Nah, dude.

48:20.160 --> 48:20.800
Just hug me here.

48:20.800 --> 48:21.760
I'll watch your cutting man.

48:21.760 --> 48:22.800
You watch my cutting man.

48:22.800 --> 48:22.960
Yeah.

48:22.960 --> 48:24.480
That sounds like a good arrangement.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.160
Please don't make me go back to the cutting man.

48:27.520 --> 48:30.880
Should we punch each other more just so they don't like ring the cutting man belt?

48:30.880 --> 48:31.040
Yeah.

48:31.040 --> 48:31.520
I guess so.

48:32.560 --> 48:33.360
Oh, man.

48:33.360 --> 48:34.800
I'm so sorry.

48:34.800 --> 48:35.600
I'm so sorry.

48:36.240 --> 48:37.360
That's what hurts so bad.

48:38.800 --> 48:40.240
My face is so tender.

48:40.240 --> 48:40.560
Please.

48:42.400 --> 48:43.280
I can't get cut.

48:43.920 --> 48:48.480
You have blunt and he has edged and I'd rather take a blunt hit.

48:48.480 --> 48:49.680
Please just punch me again.

48:49.680 --> 48:50.960
I don't want to punch you again.

48:50.960 --> 48:53.360
If you don't punch me, I have to go back to the cut man.

48:53.360 --> 48:54.080
Free me.

48:54.080 --> 48:56.400
Free me from the cut prison with your punch gloves.

48:56.400 --> 48:57.360
I'm gonna be honest with you.

48:57.360 --> 49:00.480
I don't want to go over there and I don't want to get my face all cut up to release

49:00.480 --> 49:01.360
the pressure in there.

49:01.360 --> 49:03.280
But I also don't want to get punched anymore.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.960
Do we have any way out of this?

49:04.960 --> 49:05.840
Can we save face?

49:05.840 --> 49:06.960
Can we both lay down?

49:07.600 --> 49:11.360
Do we got any kind of exit strategy out of this so we don't get to have to punch each

49:11.360 --> 49:12.080
other anymore?

49:12.080 --> 49:13.120
I'm just sleepy.

49:13.840 --> 49:14.400
You smell.

49:14.400 --> 49:14.960
Hey, dog.

49:14.960 --> 49:15.280
Hey, dog.

49:15.280 --> 49:16.080
You smell good.

49:17.440 --> 49:17.840
Thank you.

49:17.840 --> 49:22.560
Boxing is really the story of two guys trying to run away from their individual cut men

49:22.560 --> 49:24.240
and they just meet each other in the middle.

49:24.240 --> 49:27.920
It's like, well, I got to go through this guy because he is not altering his course

49:27.920 --> 49:28.480
whatsoever.

49:28.480 --> 49:32.960
And if you punch good enough, the referee doesn't make you go back to the punch man,

49:32.960 --> 49:33.840
to the cut man.

49:33.840 --> 49:37.040
I think there's some truth to what we're saying though, because every fight by like

49:37.040 --> 49:40.640
round three through ten, it's just like, not that I've watched that much boxing in

49:40.640 --> 49:42.640
my life, but it's just kind of peters out, right?

49:42.640 --> 49:43.920
And that first round, they go crazy.

49:43.920 --> 49:46.320
And after that first round, they get into a hug in the second round.

49:46.320 --> 49:48.000
They're like, hey, dude, I don't know about you.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.200
I just remembered, I do not like being punched.

49:51.200 --> 49:51.840
Yeah, me too.

49:53.040 --> 49:58.160
That's why when you see that like one punch KO on like the first punch of the mat, like

49:58.160 --> 50:00.960
at first the guy who punched the guy out is like, yeah.

50:00.960 --> 50:04.880
And he's like, oh, I didn't get myself hardly any break away from the cut man.

50:04.880 --> 50:05.920
I have to go right back.

50:05.920 --> 50:07.840
I was literally just there.

50:07.840 --> 50:12.480
I didn't get, I should have, I should have waited to knock that guy out so I could have

50:12.480 --> 50:14.880
at least like ten minutes where I wasn't with him.

50:16.080 --> 50:17.280
Oh, it's kind of sad.

50:17.280 --> 50:19.520
That's why it's called the beautiful dance for it.

50:20.160 --> 50:20.880
Do you want to go?

50:24.000 --> 50:25.680
Can I give you fucking Kanzayahu real quick?

50:26.320 --> 50:26.960
Yeah.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.240
It's by level 9,000.

50:28.240 --> 50:30.480
You know, you answers user.

50:33.440 --> 50:37.520
Sally, thank you, Sally, for this question.

50:37.520 --> 50:42.880
Sally asks, I have to go to a bully's birthday party tomorrow night and I do not know what

50:42.880 --> 50:43.840
to give them for a gift.

50:43.840 --> 50:45.120
Can anybody help me with this?

50:45.680 --> 50:46.400
No details.

50:47.280 --> 50:48.320
No details, huh?

50:48.320 --> 50:51.280
Is there not enough fucking, that's a beautiful short story.

50:51.280 --> 50:56.320
You were invited to, let's say Brock hit Lesnar.

50:56.320 --> 50:56.800
Brock Lesnar.

50:56.800 --> 50:57.520
Brock Lesnar.

50:57.520 --> 50:59.280
I would call him a fucking bully.

50:59.280 --> 51:03.120
You're invited to Brock Lesnar's birthday party and all Brock does is pick on you while

51:03.120 --> 51:03.760
you're at school.

51:05.200 --> 51:11.120
This is like, yeah, we're picturing this like a Muppet Babies, but it was like MMA and boxers.

51:11.120 --> 51:12.800
It's WWE Babies.

51:12.800 --> 51:13.600
I was getting there.

51:13.600 --> 51:16.320
Yeah, wrestling babies, wrestle babies.

51:16.320 --> 51:18.480
So you're in a wrestle babies situation.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.800
We've all been there and you're invited to this.

51:20.800 --> 51:26.640
You don't want to go, but maybe like your mom knows Brock's mom from church and she's

51:26.640 --> 51:27.520
like, we have to go.

51:27.520 --> 51:30.160
The Lesnar's, you know, they're in our Bible study.

51:30.160 --> 51:30.880
We have to go.

51:31.760 --> 51:33.280
What do you get, baby Brock?

51:35.280 --> 51:38.800
I mean, the obvious answer is a Jimmy John's sandwich or a Jimmy John's gift card.

51:39.520 --> 51:40.960
Is that a Brock Lesnar thing?

51:40.960 --> 51:44.000
Boy, that would be a fucking funny joke if either of you two knew anything about wrestling.

51:44.720 --> 51:47.680
I wasn't sure if that was a wrestling thing or just like a bully thing.

51:47.680 --> 51:52.160
Jimmy John, I'm just going to call him Jimmy John because he wears shorts as Jimmy John's

51:52.160 --> 51:56.640
on them and he's the only fucking wrestler who's allowed to wear like a logo on a thing

51:56.640 --> 52:00.320
and it's a fucking Jimmy John's pants and nobody knows why.

52:00.320 --> 52:01.040
Nobody knows why.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.080
I don't think he's getting money out of it.

52:02.080 --> 52:03.840
I think he just like loves that roast beef.

52:03.840 --> 52:05.680
He loves that hunter.

52:05.680 --> 52:06.240
Yeah.

52:06.240 --> 52:07.200
Loves that hunter.

52:09.440 --> 52:11.200
Maybe you could get him a book.

52:11.200 --> 52:14.720
I was about to say on not bullying, but what if you went the other way and got him a book

52:14.720 --> 52:20.000
on how to be a better bully and you were just like, from now on, like, I got your back.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.840
Like, I like that you're a bully.

52:21.840 --> 52:24.640
I not only want to support it, I want to make you a better bully.

52:24.640 --> 52:27.360
So when you bully me, I'm enjoying it too.

52:27.360 --> 52:28.560
Reverse psychology.

52:29.680 --> 52:33.440
Until he's like, I can't bully Travis anymore.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.520
He enjoys me being a better bully.

52:35.520 --> 52:37.040
What am I even doing?

52:37.040 --> 52:41.040
This is that fucking Hey Arnold, Helga Pataki, like nobody came to your birthday party because

52:41.040 --> 52:46.160
you're kind of a heel, but I came to it and I didn't want to at first, but now I'm learning

52:46.160 --> 52:46.800
a lot about you.

52:46.800 --> 52:47.680
You're learning a lot about me.

52:47.680 --> 52:50.080
You're still going to fucking bully me come Monday.

52:50.080 --> 52:54.800
But that Roger Klotz, if we may branch into a different, I like yours too.

52:54.800 --> 52:57.680
I just want to expand it because maybe we were talking to a little bit of a generational

52:57.680 --> 52:58.400
gap.

52:58.400 --> 53:03.360
Roger Klotz, he finds your diary, but he doesn't, he says he doesn't read it when you're afraid

53:03.360 --> 53:04.640
that he did, but he doesn't.

53:05.760 --> 53:07.840
And it turns out he's not such a bad guy.

53:07.840 --> 53:10.000
And then Biden can't sweat your shorts.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.120
He's a good character.

53:11.120 --> 53:14.320
And he puts, he puts the puzzle together.

53:14.320 --> 53:14.640
What?

53:14.640 --> 53:15.280
Ice cream.

53:15.280 --> 53:16.240
Cause he's magic.

53:17.200 --> 53:17.920
Wait, hold on.

53:17.920 --> 53:21.520
And he tries to, he goes to awful waffle you and he leans in close to your ear and he's

53:21.520 --> 53:23.920
like, I know my dad's a piece of shit too.

53:23.920 --> 53:26.160
And he lets you up and then you're free to go.

53:26.800 --> 53:28.720
And then sponge and donkey lips are there.

53:29.360 --> 53:31.200
And man, a good show.

53:31.200 --> 53:32.960
Allegra, Allegra pops out that window.

53:32.960 --> 53:34.960
She's like, hi, I existed.

53:35.520 --> 53:37.440
And also Eureka's castle.

53:37.440 --> 53:37.680
Okay.

53:39.280 --> 53:40.080
So much.

53:40.080 --> 53:40.960
I got a perfect gift.

53:41.600 --> 53:42.480
I got a perfect gift.

53:42.480 --> 53:47.280
Two satin bags for his fists.

53:48.480 --> 53:50.720
But listen, inside the satin bags.

53:52.400 --> 53:53.440
Itching powder.

53:53.440 --> 53:56.720
You got him, you got him, you got him, you got him, you got him, got him, got him, got

53:56.720 --> 53:57.840
him, got him, got him.

53:57.840 --> 53:58.240
Got him.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.440
Well, no, that's actually bad.

53:59.440 --> 54:00.240
That's actually maybe acid.

54:00.240 --> 54:03.600
Now his fists are literally itching to punch you.

54:03.600 --> 54:06.240
Yeah, that's, he's going to be withdrawing them all the time.

54:06.240 --> 54:08.800
He's going to be an object of living fear.

54:10.480 --> 54:12.240
Take it one step further, Justin.

54:12.240 --> 54:15.840
Itching powder, crazy glue around the inside rim.

54:15.840 --> 54:21.920
So he puts his hands in, itching, can't get the bags off to scratch him, goes crazy.

54:21.920 --> 54:22.240
Yeah.

54:22.240 --> 54:25.520
Hey, how are you supposed to work on a computer if you have satin bags over your hands?

54:26.560 --> 54:29.200
That's why you don't see a lot of bullies in the technical fields.

54:30.560 --> 54:31.120
That's why.

54:32.320 --> 54:33.120
That's why.

54:33.120 --> 54:33.920
I get it now.

54:33.920 --> 54:34.320
That's why.

54:34.880 --> 54:35.680
That's the answer.

54:35.680 --> 54:36.160
Okay, listen.

54:36.160 --> 54:39.520
I do just want to point out that the top answer on this question is somebody saying I would

54:39.520 --> 54:41.040
give them a book on bullying.

54:41.040 --> 54:42.800
So way to go, Travis.

54:42.800 --> 54:43.680
I did it.

54:43.680 --> 54:48.240
Or some stupid gag gift, like a roll of duct tape marked with to use over your mouth to

54:48.240 --> 54:49.440
prevent bullying.

54:49.440 --> 54:51.600
Really, I would do that in a heartbeat.

54:51.600 --> 54:52.240
Would you?

54:52.240 --> 54:53.120
Would you common sense?

54:53.120 --> 54:54.400
I think you would.

54:54.400 --> 54:56.560
Because it seems like you should have a funnier thing.

54:57.120 --> 55:00.080
If you're going to do a thing a bit, you should have a funnier bit.

55:00.080 --> 55:00.400
You should also not-

55:00.400 --> 55:02.080
Did you hear my thing about the satin bags?

55:02.080 --> 55:05.680
You should not use the phrase gag gift to describe something that would literally be

55:05.680 --> 55:07.120
used to cover someone's mouth.

55:07.680 --> 55:08.560
Because then that is-

55:08.560 --> 55:09.440
That's not what that means.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.200
I know, that's not- you're wrong.

55:11.200 --> 55:14.400
I want to go back to talk about wrestle babies because I really feel like it's a property

55:14.400 --> 55:17.360
we could expand on and be pretty rich off of.

55:17.360 --> 55:21.760
Yeah, I would love to just hear you two say basically anything about wrestling for a minute.

55:21.760 --> 55:22.480
Today wrestling.

55:22.480 --> 55:26.080
I don't want to hear any fucking Jake the Snake shit or honky tonk man bullshit.

55:26.080 --> 55:27.600
I want the current roster.

55:27.600 --> 55:29.520
Baby Undertaker, he's still in there.

55:29.520 --> 55:30.400
That's fucking cheating.

55:30.400 --> 55:31.520
That dude's 50 years old.

55:33.200 --> 55:35.520
Single H, which is baby Triple H.

55:36.080 --> 55:36.880
Okay.

55:36.880 --> 55:39.040
He hasn't earned the other two H's yet.

55:39.040 --> 55:39.840
That's fine.

55:39.840 --> 55:41.360
Do you think he would be Vince McBaby?

55:46.400 --> 55:49.680
Oh, and they would have play pin matches instead of cage matches.

55:50.240 --> 55:50.800
Okay.

55:50.800 --> 55:51.600
Heck of a sec.

55:52.160 --> 55:52.400
What?

55:52.400 --> 55:53.040
That's mine.

55:53.840 --> 55:56.480
I just took your thing because it worked here too.

55:58.240 --> 56:00.080
It's my thing now on this show.

56:01.840 --> 56:03.360
Hey listen, that's gonna do it for us.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.960
What about Goldust?

56:04.960 --> 56:11.520
Goldust, but he's just really little and he can sneak up at you through like toilet pipes.

56:11.520 --> 56:13.040
Oh God, I just gave myself a shiver.

56:15.280 --> 56:16.320
Well, birthday shiver.

56:16.320 --> 56:19.840
Well, anniversary shiver here for six years of podcasting excellence.

56:20.560 --> 56:24.080
I want to mark this occasion by thanking some folks for some stuff they sent us.

56:25.200 --> 56:28.640
Meredith and Carl, maybe Colin.

56:28.640 --> 56:32.720
I'm not real good at these notes here, but they sent us a save the day date.

56:32.720 --> 56:34.880
Um, Stephanie and Michael-

56:34.880 --> 56:37.840
Hey McElroy, save the day, Thursday.

56:37.840 --> 56:38.400
All of them.

56:39.600 --> 56:42.800
Stephanie and Michael sent us what I've noted here as an STD.

56:42.800 --> 56:44.640
I'm hoping I mean save the date there.

56:45.200 --> 56:47.280
And Tim and Mariah invited us to their wedding.

56:48.080 --> 56:51.520
Apologies to all of you that we didn't make it, but I'm sure it's gonna be a special day

56:51.520 --> 56:52.080
no matter what.

56:52.880 --> 56:55.600
Adrian sent us a $2 lottery scratcher.

56:55.600 --> 56:56.880
Didn't make any money off of that.

56:56.880 --> 56:59.120
Don't live in that state anyway, so I probably couldn't redeem it.

56:59.840 --> 57:01.200
Stephanie sent us a thank you note.

57:01.200 --> 57:06.880
Somebody sent us in a fuck you Ron mug, but there was no information along with that.

57:07.600 --> 57:10.640
Landon sent us a blizzard puck.

57:10.640 --> 57:13.360
A Huntington blizzard puck.

57:13.360 --> 57:14.560
I know, I know.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.600
We can share custody.

57:19.120 --> 57:20.880
Someone sent us juggling balls.

57:20.880 --> 57:22.720
Didn't appreciate that very much at all.

57:23.360 --> 57:24.240
They didn't have the-

57:24.240 --> 57:27.680
I have, I want you to know, I've been practicing.

57:27.680 --> 57:29.520
I also got those 2016.

57:29.520 --> 57:33.840
I'm gonna learn to juggle and then we'll have a juggler in the family.

57:33.840 --> 57:35.520
You'll just have to deal with it, dad.

57:36.560 --> 57:39.200
How many, how many flashes are you up to?

57:39.200 --> 57:40.320
Like not even one.

57:40.320 --> 57:41.200
I can't.

57:41.200 --> 57:43.280
I'm so bad at it, Justin.

57:43.280 --> 57:44.560
I'll give you some tips later.

57:46.160 --> 57:52.000
And also the Joyful Fox is the really cool Dr. Who clock, the Joyful Fox design.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.040
Oh yeah, that was really cool.

57:53.040 --> 57:53.920
You sent me a picture of that.

57:53.920 --> 57:55.600
That was, yeah, it was really neat.

57:55.600 --> 57:59.600
Um, uh, so that's, that's the gifts and I really appreciate everybody.

57:59.600 --> 58:04.240
P.O. Box 54, Huntington West Virginia, 2576 if you want to send us something.

58:04.240 --> 58:05.280
Travis has his own box.

58:05.280 --> 58:10.320
P.O. Box 909, uh, Van Nuys, California, 91408.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.480
You can find it all on McElroyShows.com.

58:12.480 --> 58:16.400
There's also like all of our shows and like the contact info and that kind of stuff.

58:16.400 --> 58:20.240
I want to say that I don't have a P.O. Box because I've sort of evolved beyond,

58:20.240 --> 58:22.480
um, owning physical possessions.

58:22.480 --> 58:25.200
But if you just want to think a good thought towards me today.

58:25.200 --> 58:29.680
Just like think like a positive, warm thought and just send some of that energy in my direction.

58:29.680 --> 58:30.880
I'd appreciate it.

58:30.880 --> 58:31.200
All right.

58:31.200 --> 58:34.240
And we want to say thanks again to MeUndies who are dedicated to providing the world's

58:34.240 --> 58:35.120

58:42.400 --> 58:46.000
Please stop subscribing my box to horse magazines.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.640
Like I get it, but they still keep, they just keep coming.

58:49.360 --> 58:52.960
I have three Western Horsemen issues that I get every, I just would rather not.

58:52.960 --> 58:56.800
I helped Justin clean out his P.O. Box when we were in town for Christmas.

58:56.800 --> 59:02.320
And no kidding, guys, it's a fucking horse disaster in there.

59:02.320 --> 59:06.160
And this is not one of those funny things where we're saying don't do it so that more

59:06.160 --> 59:06.880
people will do it.

59:06.880 --> 59:08.400
And you're like, well, I'm going to do it.

59:08.400 --> 59:09.760
It's a waste of paper.

59:09.760 --> 59:11.520
And like, it's a waste of horse.

59:11.520 --> 59:13.040
It's a waste of horse information.

59:13.040 --> 59:15.840
But most importantly, it has become a logistical nightmare.

59:16.400 --> 59:16.880
Nightmare.

59:17.600 --> 59:22.720
When my boy Tim at the Veterans Memorial Boulevard post office, when I pull up,

59:22.720 --> 59:24.240
he's like, oh, this fucking guy.

59:24.240 --> 59:29.600
They have literal, they have literal tubs in the back room full of unread horse magazines.

59:30.240 --> 59:31.760
And it's, it is embarrassing.

59:32.480 --> 59:34.320
It is embarrassing, but postcards are nice.

59:34.320 --> 59:35.040
You can do that.

59:35.040 --> 59:35.760
Postcards are great.

59:35.760 --> 59:39.360
Unless one of those postcards ends up in one of the fucking folds of the horse magazines

59:39.360 --> 59:41.920
and we'll never see it because it got tucked away in there and we thought it was like a

59:41.920 --> 59:44.000
mailer for a second subscription.

59:45.040 --> 59:49.360
Just saying that the hazards of these horse magazines are unlimited.

59:49.360 --> 59:55.840
Justin, can I just say real quick too, as we near our 300th episode, it's so nice.

59:55.840 --> 59:57.360
Thank you everybody for listening.

59:57.360 --> 01:00:03.360
Like I, I've just every week struck by the fact of like, people still like this, huh?

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.040
That's, that's crazy to me.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.160
And I'm so humbled by it.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:06.720
Thank you very much.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.800
We'll talk more about it at the 300th episode.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:16.960
Um, I, I will say I, I have now ended the submission line for the people, like the look

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:21.280
back retrospective since I started listening to my brother, my brother and me soundbites

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:25.040
cause I have so many of them and they're so good and I have to start working on it.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:30.240
So I can no longer accept new ones, but thank you to everybody who sent one in and hopefully

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.240
I can get that all done in two weeks.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.520
I want to thank, say thanks to John Roderick in the long winter.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.240
She used our theme song.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.320
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.600
It's fucking great.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.160
Great album.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:40.800
Good to listen to.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.240
Good to hear with your ears.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.120
Good to taste.

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:44.960

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.920

I do have a final Yahoo.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.520
Um, it was sent in by no kidding.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:08.320
Probably 19 people, 19 different people sent this in over email over Twitter.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:08.880
Thank you all.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.880

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.960
Can anyone tell me how to get young Joseph Stalin hair

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.400
without showing the barber a picture of young Joseph Stalin?

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.880

We host the medical history podcast saw bones, a tour of all the weird,

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:08.000
stupid, terrible, horrifying, hilarious ways that we've tried to fix people over the years.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.280
