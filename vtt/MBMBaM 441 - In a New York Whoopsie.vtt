WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.520
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern

00:49.520 --> 00:56.480
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. It's an

00:56.480 --> 01:01.360
interesting energy, Justin. Yeah, it's weird. I'm sweet baby brother 30 under 30 media luminary

01:01.360 --> 01:06.960
Griffin McElroy. I don't know if y'all saw the news. I know y'all did on the call, but y'all

01:06.960 --> 01:13.680
who are listening to the episode. Y'all proper. We're gonna be writing a book, a comic book,

01:13.680 --> 01:19.760
five issues of one. I prefer funny book. There's different classifications. There's

01:19.760 --> 01:25.680
comics and graphic novels, and my art is funny books. I like to do funny books. I like to do the

01:25.680 --> 01:33.600
funny pages. Silly papers. It's called Journey into Mystery. It's part of the, what is it,

01:33.600 --> 01:39.760
Thor Fight series, something about Thor. Thor Fight 2019. Thor's fighting everyone on this one,

01:39.760 --> 01:46.880
and we are, I guess the big headline here is we're writing a funny book. It'll be out in April,

01:46.880 --> 01:55.120
but we are also officially co-workers with Wolverine. Yep. I'm three cubicles down from

01:55.120 --> 02:00.400
Logan. So I'm in a completely different department from Logan, and my interactions with him are all

02:00.400 --> 02:06.320
in the kitchen, and they are pretty bad because of all the pranks he does to me. I'm kind of his

02:06.320 --> 02:12.880
Dwight. He did my stuff in Jell-O, and he stabbed my dad three times. He stabbed my dad once,

02:12.880 --> 02:17.680
but it counted as three because he has three knives, but how is he being near him? Is he

02:17.680 --> 02:25.200
listening to loud music? Yeah, and here's the thing. The motherfucker hums along with the music.

02:25.200 --> 02:30.560
Just under the level of loud enough that you would feel comfortable saying something to Gladys,

02:30.560 --> 02:36.000
the office manager. You're saying Gladys is like, it's not that loud, but it's loud enough

02:36.560 --> 02:47.360
that I can't not hear it. Yeah. Hi, guys. It's me, the manager, Justin. Hi, Justin. Hi,

02:47.360 --> 02:55.520
Justin. I couldn't help but overhear you all talking about Logan, and I'm not sure that you're

02:55.520 --> 03:01.760
really producing the healthiest work environment with these kinds of comments. Well, Justin,

03:01.760 --> 03:09.680
just real quick, I left a note on your desk for HR about the dad-stabbing incident, so I feel like

03:09.680 --> 03:13.200
it's weird that you're coming to me first. I don't want to step on Griffin's toes, but I feel like

03:13.200 --> 03:19.440
the humming thing is as bad as the dad-stabbing thing. Well, multiply mine by three, because again,

03:19.440 --> 03:23.920
three knives in this guy's hand. Yeah, but he hums every day, Griffin. Sure, sure, sure. Okay. Well,

03:23.920 --> 03:29.280
that's a fair point. Listen, guys, why don't you take a seat and we'll get this all sorted out.

03:29.280 --> 03:34.160
Oh, boy. Oh, see, I wasn't looking at our conversation. That was the chair scooting back.

03:34.800 --> 03:42.320
That's me sitting down in it. Berkey, could you get? Berkey! Can you get Logan down here?

03:42.320 --> 03:46.720
Oh, goodness. Berkey, get Logan down here and ask him to- I don't want to confront him,

03:46.720 --> 03:52.720
he's a super hero. I'm afraid he's going to get mad. Okay, here he comes. He's going to stay

03:52.720 --> 03:57.920
completely silent though, Trav, so don't worry about it. He won't yell at me. Oh, he's wearing

03:57.920 --> 04:08.000
flip flops again. Oh, man. Logan, if you could just sit right there. You remember Travis and Griffin?

04:08.000 --> 04:21.280
Hey, Logan. Hey, Logan. Logan. I'm sorry, can he put the knives in his hand when we're doing this?

04:21.280 --> 04:25.920
I feel like it's a little threatening. I don't know how you- I know you snicked him out,

04:25.920 --> 04:29.840
I don't know what sound it makes when they go back in. Oh, see, when you weren't looking,

04:29.840 --> 04:35.200
he had just one of them out, like the middle finger. And Justin, that's what we're talking

04:35.200 --> 04:40.560
about. That's the kind of shit we're talking about. Logan, guys. Slip your knife back up

04:40.560 --> 04:47.120
into your hand and let's talk about this like adults. Logan, put them away. Thank you. Logan.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.160
I said put them away, Logan.

04:54.400 --> 04:59.840
See, I can't deal with this. How am I supposed to do Marvel's accounting work and write a comic

04:59.840 --> 05:06.640
book while Logan's doing this? Logan, this is uncomfortable. This is- let me back up.

05:07.520 --> 05:15.360
You've given a lot of great work to this company. We love the blue and orange and yellow suit.

05:16.320 --> 05:23.920
We were wild about the orange and brown one. And then one day you just refused to wear costumes at

05:23.920 --> 05:30.160
all. Yeah, you just kind of went tank top and jeans, which- I'm sorry, I didn't jump in. I was a fan.

05:30.160 --> 05:39.360
Thank you. We were all trying to let that slide, Logan, but at this point, we-

05:42.000 --> 05:45.920
Hey guys, do we have to be careful about what we say about a lot of things now?

05:45.920 --> 05:50.160
This is just now occurring to me as I'm trying to inhabit this great character.

05:50.160 --> 05:55.040
No, comedy is all about just being, you know, offensive and being an offensive

05:55.040 --> 06:00.000
rude boy. And so like, I think we can say whatever we want. Devil may care.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.440
Yeah, I think Justin, Frankenstein teen, become the monster.

06:03.440 --> 06:03.680
Yeah.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.000
Deadpool sucks. There.

06:06.000 --> 06:06.800
Oh no, we can't say that.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.120
Take that, Marvel. I don't think you should say that.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.680
No, I enjoyed those movies actually quite a bit.

06:11.680 --> 06:17.680
I just watched- actually, I just watched the second half of the second one. This is being a

06:17.680 --> 06:22.480
father. I watched the first half of the second one two months ago and thought I should circle

06:22.480 --> 06:25.760
back around the second half of the second one.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.600
Hey, can we get back into the bit?

06:27.600 --> 06:28.000
Oh, yeah.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.600
Yeah, yeah. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

06:29.600 --> 06:29.840
Okay.

06:29.840 --> 06:30.080
Okay.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.800
Logan, I just wanted to say that like, you may think you're hot shit with your

06:34.800 --> 06:40.320
knife hands, but I just wanted to say, we are the ones writing this particular comic.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.840
And I don't think you are necessarily in it, but we could put you in it.

06:43.840 --> 06:48.480
And then I could, like, for instance, I could write a scene where Magneto gets up

06:48.480 --> 06:52.800
close to you and farts so bad and you smell it and die like an idiot.

06:52.800 --> 06:57.200
Yeah. You know what? We don't even need to write you into it. We can just have a character say,

06:57.200 --> 07:01.840
like, Logan told me the other day he likes to eat poop that he finds.

07:01.840 --> 07:06.480
And yeah, Spider-Man's like, it's too bad about Wolverine. And then somebody else is like,

07:06.480 --> 07:09.840
what's wrong? And Spider-Man's like, Magneto farted in his face and he smelled it so bad

07:09.840 --> 07:10.800
he died like an idiot.

07:10.800 --> 07:16.320
Mm-hmm. And like, maybe like Kate Bishop is like, I heard that Logan went down a

07:16.320 --> 07:21.760
water slide so fast that his underpants ripped off. And like, he was really embarrassed.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.000
And no one will sell him underpants.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.840
And now no one will sell him underpants.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.440
So he's naked all the time.

07:27.440 --> 07:31.440
Yeah, and he smells like Magneto's fart because it lingers in all of his chest hair.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.120
Yeah, and his sideburns and stuff.

07:33.680 --> 07:36.560
Would you like, hey, would you like that, Wolverine?

07:36.560 --> 07:38.160
You wouldn't like that, would you?

07:38.160 --> 07:41.120
I don't care, dude. I've got no more dads to stab, bud.

07:42.240 --> 07:46.480
You stabbed all the dads. Wait, it's my dad too. Hold on, this is just occurring to me.

07:46.480 --> 07:46.880
Logan.

07:47.440 --> 07:47.760
Yeah.

07:47.760 --> 07:53.520
We could make him have a, like, a tattoo that says Lemon Diet Coke forever.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:55.440 --> 08:02.960
Hey, on this topic, could I, could I, like, solve the, you know, the big fight that we're writing

08:02.960 --> 08:10.000
with, like, me, Griffin, coming in and stopping it, and then, like, I get to be in the movies?

08:10.560 --> 08:14.480
This is my favorite thing that people who, like, write, get their own comic series,

08:14.480 --> 08:15.360
like TV shows or whatever.

08:15.360 --> 08:20.800
They make a character and, like, they establish, like, that character is low-key, not low-key,

08:20.800 --> 08:25.680
low-key the strongest character in, like, the, the comics universe.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.160
Sure.

08:26.160 --> 08:30.640
If you did that, it's like you just introduced Griffin and he's invincible and two times

08:30.640 --> 08:37.120
stronger than the Hulk and, like, he, he shoots webs, but better than Spider-Man.

08:37.120 --> 08:37.360
Yeah.

08:37.360 --> 08:42.000
We don't have, we don't have Peter Parker in ours, but, like, this, this sort of example

08:42.000 --> 08:47.840
would work better if we do. What if we, like, had a scene where Spider-Man took off his

08:47.840 --> 08:53.920
mask and it was Peter Parker, and then everybody's, like, gasp, and he's, like,

08:53.920 --> 08:59.440
oh, you ain't seen nothing yet, and he pulls it off and it's me, and it's actually-

08:59.440 --> 09:00.720
Oh, shit.

09:00.720 --> 09:05.760
Been me the entire time since, like, the 20s. I don't know.

09:05.760 --> 09:10.560
Yeah, you know what I like, what would be better is then he tears off his suit and it's

09:10.560 --> 09:14.640
the Hulk's body, but Justin's head and face.

09:15.440 --> 09:21.600
See, I don't need that much. I'm happy if, like, Thor comes back to, like, I don't know,

09:21.600 --> 09:27.360
finish his, his big fight or whatever, and where's he been? Well, he's been with me and

09:27.360 --> 09:29.760
I've been coaching him. I'm Thor's life coach.

09:29.760 --> 09:30.560
I see.

09:30.560 --> 09:35.040
And without me, and he says this numerous times, without Travis, I am nothing.

09:35.040 --> 09:35.520
Well, and then-

09:35.520 --> 09:40.480
So, like, I'm not the most powerful, but, like, the most powerful needs me.

09:40.480 --> 09:44.960
And I'll just, I'll just write in that Thor finds his estranged father, Thor Senior, and

09:44.960 --> 09:45.520
that's me.

09:46.160 --> 09:50.160
Whoa. And then he unstabs our dad.

09:52.160 --> 09:56.160
If we have time, we'll find room to work in the undead stabbing.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:57.440 --> 10:03.040
We could have Spider-Man say, you know, a great man once told me, with great power comes

10:03.040 --> 10:08.560
great responsibility. And then someone else says, oh, yeah, you're Uncle Ben. And then

10:08.560 --> 10:14.800
Peter Parker says, no. The only thing my Uncle Ben ever told me is, hey, shut up, wheel is

10:14.800 --> 10:20.640
on. Enjoy this rice. And enjoy the rice. And the Yankees have no hitting this year.

10:20.640 --> 10:25.920
Those are the two things my Uncle Ben ever said to me. No, my best friend Justin McElroy,

10:25.920 --> 10:30.640
a grown adult, said those things to me, and it really inspired me and changed my life.

10:30.640 --> 10:34.720
I'll never forget when Justin was gunned down by those gangsters while saving all of those

10:34.720 --> 10:40.800
orphans and puppies. And his dying breath, he said, with great power comes great responsibility.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.560
And don't do Spider-Man 2.

10:42.560 --> 10:47.280
And then he got one more thing in before he died, and it was Wolverine smell magnate.

10:49.280 --> 10:53.760
And then later, when no one expected it, he came back.

10:53.760 --> 10:58.960
He was the greatest hero of them all, Superman 2.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.760
And Superman squared.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.840
And Superman times Hulk.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.640
Superman plus Hulk.

11:06.640 --> 11:10.560
Justin McElroy this entire time has been Superman on Hulk's shoulders.

11:11.840 --> 11:12.880
Go get him, son.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.480
With an Iron Man suit on.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.400
Sorry about your luck, Hitler.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.880
Oh, yeah, he's from the 40s. I love that vibe.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.080
That's also Super Justin's catchphrase.

11:24.080 --> 11:26.720
He says that all the time, even when not fighting Hitler.

11:26.720 --> 11:30.400
He's just so popular that one time he fought Hitler, he can't stop saying it.

11:30.400 --> 11:34.960
We are, do we send this part to a lawyer, like the first 13 minutes to a lawyer,

11:34.960 --> 11:40.400
just to protect, just to have a lawyer look at it and check our work?

11:41.120 --> 11:42.960
Just kind of make sure it's all clear.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.120
Anyway, it's called Journey into Mystery, comes out April 10th,

11:45.120 --> 11:47.680
and it's going to be like five issues, so.

11:47.680 --> 11:51.760
A bunch of people said you should have waited 10 days and it's like, yeah, those are the decisions we get to make.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.920
The day comes out.

11:53.920 --> 11:59.840
We called up the Marvel president people and we're like, do you guys know about weed?

11:59.840 --> 12:01.760
You guys know weed, right?

12:01.760 --> 12:02.800
Y'all know about weed, right?

12:03.440 --> 12:04.560
Ask Mickey about weed.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.680
Okay, so anyway, this is a podcast.

12:07.680 --> 12:08.960
It's an advice show or something.

12:10.080 --> 12:15.680
We say that it's so much more, it's really more of a family at this point.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.320
Sometimes it's so much less, though.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.840
Some families podcast.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.560
We're getting to the point where it's finally feeling like family, folks.

12:24.880 --> 12:28.560
So, I was cleaning out my closet over the holiday season,

12:28.560 --> 12:31.760
and I found this unwrapped present hiding in a back corner.

12:31.760 --> 12:35.200
It's a Christmas present, still wrapped, from four years ago,

12:35.200 --> 12:39.520
that my now roommate gave to me to give to one of our other friends.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.240
I obviously never did that.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.840
So what do I do?

12:43.840 --> 12:48.080
If I open it and keep it, my roommate will know I never gave it to the person I was supposed to.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.880
Should I just keep it in my closet forever?

12:51.520 --> 12:54.480
That's from poor present transporter in California.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.120
I'm going to assume then that that's a misprint in the beginning

12:57.120 --> 13:00.480
where you say you found an unwrapped present and then say it was still wrapped.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.400
You probably meant you found a wrapped present.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.480
An un-un-un unwrapped.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.440
I will count.

13:05.440 --> 13:08.640
Everything's just an unwrapped present, if you think about it.

13:08.640 --> 13:09.120
Yeah.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.120
Issue, unwrapped present.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.880
This poem, unwrapped present.

13:12.880 --> 13:13.680
Unwrapped present.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.680
Except for explicitly wrapped presents.

13:17.680 --> 13:18.400
Or not them.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.160
Hey, this is a bad ruse you've got going.

13:22.160 --> 13:27.280
Because there's a huge sort of failure point here in it.

13:27.280 --> 13:30.880
And it's that the roommate will at some point have...

13:31.440 --> 13:34.720
The roommate could ostensibly find out that the person they meant to give the present to

13:34.720 --> 13:35.920
never received it.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.160
And whether that's they go to their house and it's like,

13:38.160 --> 13:39.680
where's the punch bowl, punch bowl, punch bowl,

13:39.680 --> 13:40.960
looking for the punch bowl, where's the punch bowl?

13:40.960 --> 13:42.240
And it's not there.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.560
Or they explicitly just say,

13:44.560 --> 13:48.000
hey, do you ever use that punch bowl I got you?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.120
Then the jig is up.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.440
And then they're going to assume that you stole it, pawned it.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.000
Hey, did you...

13:54.800 --> 13:56.320
I've been meaning to ask you,

13:56.320 --> 13:58.000
did you like that ferret I bought you?

13:59.040 --> 14:00.080
Oh, no.

14:00.080 --> 14:00.480
It's...

14:00.480 --> 14:02.400
You gotta fess up, I feel like.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.120
I know that our position on these matters is usually very like,

14:07.200 --> 14:08.400
zag on them,

14:08.400 --> 14:11.120
2015, lie and steal and be bad.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.480
But listen, it's 2019.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.480
It's time for you to become the monster.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.640
By which I mean confront your fear of how bad this is going to be

14:19.200 --> 14:22.880
when you do own up to not delivering on this Christmas cheer.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.240
Because I'm not going to lie to you.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.680
You fucked up pretty bad.

14:25.680 --> 14:26.720
Yeah, but what if...

14:26.720 --> 14:29.680
Okay, this is different from advice we've ever given.

14:29.680 --> 14:34.000
But what if you just walked up to the other friend,

14:34.000 --> 14:35.680
the one that is supposed to get the present,

14:35.680 --> 14:36.720
and you say,

14:36.720 --> 14:39.200
hey, I fucked up real bad.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.720
My roommate, our friend,

14:40.720 --> 14:42.080
gave me this present and gave it to you,

14:42.080 --> 14:43.360
and I completely forgot about it.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.560
It's been four years.

14:44.560 --> 14:46.960
Yes, I fucked up, but here you go.

14:46.960 --> 14:50.000
And, and, please don't tell them.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.600
And never to.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.960
You can't ever tell anyone.

14:52.960 --> 14:53.920
I don't agree.

14:54.720 --> 14:55.680
If I'm looking at the...

14:55.680 --> 14:57.280
If I'm looking at a chart right now,

14:57.280 --> 14:59.040
people who are angry, none.

15:00.720 --> 15:01.200
Right?

15:01.200 --> 15:02.480
If you give them the gift,

15:02.480 --> 15:04.480
that person's angry instantly.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.920
There's one person angry.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.440
If they tell your other friends,

15:07.440 --> 15:10.960
if they tell your other friends, that's two people angry.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.120
And you're not feeling so hot yourself.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.360
It seems like everyone is more upset

15:15.360 --> 15:17.280
now that you have given this present away.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.080
Other thing is,

15:18.640 --> 15:22.560
put it in the closet and forget about it.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.080
And then if your friend is like,

15:25.360 --> 15:29.120
oh man, come on, get the present.

15:29.120 --> 15:29.920
You could be like,

15:29.920 --> 15:33.280
oh shit, hold on, let me fix it.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.880
And then they're kind of mad,

15:34.880 --> 15:37.360
but you have plausible deniability.

15:37.360 --> 15:41.120
It seems to me that if you suddenly

15:41.120 --> 15:42.960
just decide to deliver it,

15:42.960 --> 15:44.640
it seems very intentional.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.280
I feel like that would make me much more frustrated

15:47.280 --> 15:49.760
than just letting them like...

15:50.480 --> 15:51.520
We both have stuff.

15:51.520 --> 15:52.560
Go Travis.

15:52.560 --> 15:53.200
Okay.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.960
Put it in your now roommate's closet

15:54.960 --> 15:55.920
when they're not home.

15:55.920 --> 15:56.720
Oh.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.480
Like under a t-shirt or something.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.840
And then your roommate will be like,

15:59.840 --> 16:00.800
hey, what's this?

16:00.800 --> 16:02.480
And you're like, I don't know, what?

16:02.480 --> 16:05.120
So listen, I'm giving you two options.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.560
One, complete honesty.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.320
Two, the deepest lie.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.240
You never gave it to me.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.200
You fucked up.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.920
Put it in the recipient's bed while they're sleeping.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.000
And then you wake up.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.600
What I will say is what's gonna really

16:17.600 --> 16:19.040
take the edge off this.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.480
Don't do it right now,

16:20.480 --> 16:22.640
holy shit, this close to the holidays.

16:22.640 --> 16:23.200
No way.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.960
In May, in fucking August,

16:27.520 --> 16:30.720
when you want a big fun holiday

16:30.720 --> 16:32.960
to just get psyched out of your mind,

16:32.960 --> 16:35.120
but there's not a whole lot there for you.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.520
And then you get a Christmas present?

16:37.520 --> 16:38.800
It doesn't matter how old it is.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.760
It doesn't matter how dusty,

16:41.760 --> 16:45.120
how many cobwebs it's developed on its hide.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.160
That's exciting.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.360
Christmas in August.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.600
And then you give it to him and you say,

16:49.600 --> 16:50.480
this is from me.

16:51.680 --> 16:52.800
Oh, okay.

16:52.800 --> 16:53.520
I don't like that.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.720
You don't know what it is though.

16:54.720 --> 16:55.760
Oh wait, that's like a call.

16:55.760 --> 16:56.560
It might be shitty.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.000
Could be a framed picture

16:58.000 --> 16:59.840
of this person in their roommate.

16:59.840 --> 17:00.720
This is from me.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.720
A picture of you in my roommate.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.680
How about a Yahoo?

17:05.680 --> 17:06.160
Sure, yeah.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.880
I mean, here's one from Elliot.

17:08.880 --> 17:09.440
Thank you, Elliot.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.960
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

17:10.960 --> 17:11.600
who I'm gonna call

17:13.200 --> 17:14.400
Muscly James.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.400
There's an ad.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.840
There's a man running on a treadmill.

17:17.840 --> 17:18.320
He's huge.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.440
Muscly James asks,

17:21.440 --> 17:29.280
what is a polite way to pocket pick?

17:29.280 --> 17:33.040
These days when you hear about thefts,

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
there is, it's usually not cute.

17:38.880 --> 17:42.240
I feel like the era of the gentleman thief

17:42.240 --> 17:46.320
or gentle person thief is well over.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.800
Is there anything that we can get going again

17:48.800 --> 17:52.240
by doing a polite pocket pick?

17:52.880 --> 17:54.000
Here's what you do.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.960
You wait at an airport in like, say,

17:58.080 --> 18:00.800
I don't know, Montreal, right?

18:00.800 --> 18:03.600
For a plane that just got there from America.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.400
You pick their pocket and take their American money.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.440
But what's that?

18:07.440 --> 18:09.280
You've slipped some Canadian bills in there.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.240
I see, yes.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.160
So you have picked their pocket,

18:12.160 --> 18:14.720
but also they don't have to hit up the currency exchange.

18:14.720 --> 18:18.560
Now, but maybe the Travis McElroy gentleman thief

18:18.560 --> 18:20.640
exchange rate is gonna be a little bit different.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.320
Well, yes, absolutely.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.880
But I would pay a little bit extra

18:24.880 --> 18:28.240
to be saved having to interact with another human being

18:28.240 --> 18:31.520
while doing an exchange that I have no idea how it works.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.200
That's my nightmare.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.240
There's something that you can leave in there.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.600
There's something you can leave in there

18:37.600 --> 18:39.680
that will not only take the edge off,

18:39.680 --> 18:41.200
you will feel like you have come out

18:41.200 --> 18:42.560
on top of the equation.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.480
And I'm having trouble.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.360
It's not candy.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.800
I feel like candy would be good for a second.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.440
Then you'd be like, well, I can't go to bars

18:49.440 --> 18:51.280
because I don't have my shit anymore.

18:51.280 --> 18:56.960
Mm-hmm, a better wallet?

18:59.040 --> 19:03.760
Now, Juice, does it have money and stuff

19:03.760 --> 19:04.720
and cards in there?

19:04.720 --> 19:05.440
A better life.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.280
A better life.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.080
A new life.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.840
And they can better life.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.200
Okay, are you switching wallets?

19:11.200 --> 19:12.640
Is it the Gentleman Thief's?

19:13.280 --> 19:16.240
Switches your wallet with a different wallet

19:16.880 --> 19:20.000
that contains within its folds a better life,

19:20.000 --> 19:23.760
a way forward for you and Janine and the girls.

19:24.960 --> 19:28.960
A new chance at the life you always swore you'd have.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.560
Credit cards, a driver's license,

19:34.560 --> 19:36.960
an acceptance letter to that prep school

19:36.960 --> 19:39.360
that you tried to get the girls into for so long

19:39.360 --> 19:40.720
and never could quite pull it off.

19:40.720 --> 19:41.680
It's a new start.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.320
Janine, it's what we waited for.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.760
We have to take this chance.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.120
It's a miracle.

19:47.760 --> 19:50.240
It's like the address on the driver's license,

19:50.240 --> 19:51.040
like your new house.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.840
Exactly, it's a new start.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.320
There's pictures of well-trained dogs in your wallet.

19:57.680 --> 19:58.880
Daryl, we can't just-

19:58.880 --> 19:59.760
Daryl's dead.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.400
My name is Victor.

20:03.440 --> 20:04.720
Victor Newchance.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.120
It says right here on my new wallet.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.520
My name is Victor Newchance

20:09.520 --> 20:12.320
and your name is still Janine, I guess.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.480
There's no driver's license for you.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.080
There's no driver's license for you.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.920
Maybe I'm supposed to go by myself,

20:17.920 --> 20:20.240
Janine, but I'm taking you and the girls with me.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.360
Let's be conspicuous.

20:21.360 --> 20:24.480
I hope nobody switches Janine's wallet.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.040
She's got a lot of money.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.200
And nothing going on, really.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.680
No big opportunities on her horizon.

20:35.680 --> 20:40.560
Close doors for Janine.

20:40.560 --> 20:43.520
Big, open butt pockets.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.920
Where the wallet lives.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.080
That could be really good, Justin.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.240
Just a new start.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.440
Or maybe a little puzzle.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.320
Maybe a puzzle.

20:58.320 --> 20:59.840
Sort of a skill testing puzzle.

21:00.720 --> 21:00.960
Yeah.

21:00.960 --> 21:01.840
Like one of those where it's like

21:01.840 --> 21:05.360
you try to get the little metal beads into the holes.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.160
That kind of thing.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.800
Any kind of puzzle really, Trav.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.000
Like a word search?

21:10.640 --> 21:11.280
Sure, man.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.360
Any puzzle that you could think of

21:13.360 --> 21:15.440
is probably equally funny, I would guess.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.240
A crossword.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.280
A sudoku.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.720
Man, you know a lot of puzzles.

21:18.720 --> 21:19.840
I gotta give it up.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.920
You could say if you solve the puzzle,

21:21.920 --> 21:23.200
you're gonna get your wallet back.

21:23.200 --> 21:23.840
I'm watching.

21:23.840 --> 21:24.880
And they stay there

21:24.880 --> 21:27.200
and they spend a couple hours working on the puzzle.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.160
By the time they solve it,

21:28.880 --> 21:30.480
we're sitting on a beach, earning 20%.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.240
But then when they solve it,

21:32.240 --> 21:34.160
we do have to give their wallet back.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.320
Trav, did you not fucking hear what I said?

21:36.320 --> 21:37.680
But you said that if they solve it,

21:37.680 --> 21:38.800
you would give their wallet back.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.640
But I can't, Trav,

21:40.640 --> 21:42.320
because unless they're on the beach,

21:42.320 --> 21:44.160
earning 20% with me.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.400
Well, you would go back to where they are.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.960
But the 20% needs me there at the beach.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.240
But then why tell them,

21:50.240 --> 21:52.640
Griffin, why tell them to solve the puzzle then

21:52.640 --> 21:53.840
if you're not gonna give it back?

21:53.840 --> 21:55.200
Because it seems like a waste of time.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.000
What about a lotto ticket?

21:58.000 --> 21:58.720
Ooh.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.200
Now, if you do that a million times,

22:01.200 --> 22:05.040
somebody is gonna be helped by that.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.320
Somebody's gonna be helped by that.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.480
And then karmically, I think you still come out on top.

22:08.480 --> 22:11.680
But can you imagine if it happened the first time, Griffin?

22:11.680 --> 22:12.400
Oh, beans.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.920
The first wallet you steal,

22:13.920 --> 22:17.440
you put, oh, it won $38 million or whatever.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.680
That is a barrel of beans.

22:19.680 --> 22:22.160
You're not gonna keep pickpocketing after that.

22:22.160 --> 22:25.440
Oh, shoot, I'd be so freaking PO'd.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.800
Your fire's gone out.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.480
You don't wanna pick any pockets.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.400
Do people still pick pockets?

22:30.400 --> 22:31.920
When a criminal wants something from you,

22:31.920 --> 22:35.120
I feel like they usually go through a less savory.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.720
I was convinced growing up

22:36.720 --> 22:39.840
that anywhere where there were more than three people,

22:39.840 --> 22:42.880
you are 95% likely to get pickpocketed.

22:42.880 --> 22:43.680
Interesting.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.760
And so I think maybe what happened is the wallet chain

22:45.760 --> 22:48.000
made the gentleman pickpocket go extinct.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.800
Yeah.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.440
Oh, it's attached to him.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.560
I saw a lot of wallet chains in the late 90s, early aughts,

22:54.560 --> 22:56.720
and I never saw one of them prevent a theft

22:56.720 --> 22:58.800
and damn it, I really wish I had

22:58.800 --> 23:00.640
because that would have been so funny.

23:00.640 --> 23:04.800
I did see them facilitate a lot of skateboard accidents.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.720
Let's say, because I'll tell you this.

23:06.720 --> 23:09.200
If I pull a wallet out of Jinko Jeans,

23:09.200 --> 23:11.920
which were made to be stolen from,

23:11.920 --> 23:13.440
what with their jumbo.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.760
They're like some sort of carnival game.

23:15.760 --> 23:16.600
Yeah.

23:18.240 --> 23:20.720
But a carnival game for kids, you know,

23:20.720 --> 23:23.280
like this is the kids version of Skee-Ball.

23:23.280 --> 23:25.920
I could steal a wallet from one butt popper

23:25.920 --> 23:28.720
from one butt pocket while dunking a tennis ball

23:28.720 --> 23:29.920
full force into the other one.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.040
They would be none the wiser.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.080
But then they would have the wallet chain.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.520
I bet you dollars to donuts.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.400
If it was me and I was at the mall and I got this wallet

23:38.400 --> 23:40.720
and I pulled it and then had the initial snap back

23:40.720 --> 23:43.440
of hitting that chain tension

23:43.440 --> 23:46.080
and then the skater looks back at me,

23:46.080 --> 23:49.520
I bet you I could pull that wallet hard enough

23:49.520 --> 23:54.000
to either rip the pants or break the chain.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.840
I could either rip the pants or break the chain.

23:55.840 --> 23:57.600
And now you're in a real pickle

23:57.600 --> 24:00.480
because one, your pants are torn and messed up

24:00.480 --> 24:01.360
and they're falling down

24:01.360 --> 24:03.680
and everybody's laughing at you, Wolverine.

24:03.680 --> 24:07.760
Or two, I have now a weapon on a chain

24:07.760 --> 24:08.960
that I can use against you.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.240
I have a wallet flail.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.280
How about another question?

24:13.280 --> 24:13.920
Yes.

24:13.920 --> 24:14.640
Would that be okay?

24:15.280 --> 24:16.960
I tend to sneeze rather loudly.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.920
I'm not doing it on purpose or anything.

24:19.920 --> 24:20.880
Uh-huh.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.920
It's just how I've always sneezed.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.520
A few days ago at work, I noticed a coworker of mine

24:27.520 --> 24:29.200
give me a dirty look after I sneeze.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.680
I figured I was just imagining things

24:31.680 --> 24:32.720
until about an hour later

24:33.280 --> 24:35.360
when I noticed her glance over my direction

24:35.360 --> 24:38.240
and then sneeze so loudly, she was nearly screaming.

24:40.560 --> 24:41.760
Should I just shrug it off?

24:41.760 --> 24:43.280
Nearly screaming, huh?

24:44.000 --> 24:44.640
Or does this mean?

24:46.480 --> 24:48.640
That's from Achoo and Appalachia.

24:48.640 --> 24:50.880
Hey, listen, it's me, Justin.

24:50.880 --> 24:53.680
I've got a lot of human foibles and faults.

24:53.680 --> 24:56.240
This is coming from a place of 100% humility.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.080
My heart is open to you.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.560
You should sneeze quieter.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.840
You just should sneeze a little quieter

25:05.840 --> 25:09.680
and I don't think you consciously make the choice

25:09.680 --> 25:13.040
every time you sneeze to sneeze very loudly

25:13.040 --> 25:17.440
but I think you did make it one time when you were seven

25:17.440 --> 25:18.640
and you said, fuck it.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.800
This is fine.

25:20.800 --> 25:21.520
This is fine.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.000
I'm gonna blow the doors off these motherfuckers.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.200
Here we go.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.320
And then you blew it up

25:26.320 --> 25:28.640
and then years and years and years and years later,

25:28.640 --> 25:30.160
you don't remember this being a conscious choice

25:30.160 --> 25:31.920
but my thing for you would just be

25:32.480 --> 25:34.240
one thing to work on in 2019

25:34.240 --> 25:37.920
would just be to sneeze quieter.

25:37.920 --> 25:42.160
Or at least carry a thick flannel handkerchief

25:42.160 --> 25:44.240
that you might muffle said sneeze.

25:44.240 --> 25:44.800
Is that it?

25:44.800 --> 25:47.360
Did you sleeve it?

25:47.360 --> 25:48.800
Did you cover that?

25:48.800 --> 25:50.000
Oh, you gotta cover that.

25:50.000 --> 25:50.880
Yeah, you gotta vampire.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.200
Because if you sneeze that loudly.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.320
Oh, shit.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.920
Become the monster, folks.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.200
If you gotta sneeze, vampire it.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.000
Yes.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.280
Yeah, you gotta vampire.

25:59.280 --> 26:00.160
It's not bad.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.120
There are people who are like,

26:01.120 --> 26:03.840
why did you pick a bad thing and say people do bad stuff?

26:03.840 --> 26:04.800
We're not.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.000
Sleeve it, sneeze it.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.200
It can mean so many things.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.760
If you take it to mean that you should do bad things

26:09.760 --> 26:11.600
then you are already a bad monster.

26:12.960 --> 26:13.920
Let me say this.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.360
You're looking at that, you're like,

26:15.360 --> 26:16.640
do I need another cookie?

26:17.200 --> 26:18.880
Hey, become the monster.

26:18.880 --> 26:19.440
Become the monster, go for it.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.480
Cookie monster.

26:20.480 --> 26:21.440
Yes, for sure.

26:21.440 --> 26:22.560
Anyway, we're getting so far away from it.

26:22.560 --> 26:23.040
All right, guys.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.240
Probably the angriest I've ever been in my entire life

26:28.960 --> 26:31.040
is being in a room of people working

26:31.040 --> 26:33.040
and somebody does one of those screams.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.880
There's one of those sneezes where they scream

26:35.600 --> 26:37.120
in the first part, you know what I mean?

26:37.120 --> 26:38.320
Like, ah-choo.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.880
And then they give that look like,

26:42.880 --> 26:45.040
ah, shucks, that's just the way I sneeze.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.120
It's fucking not.

26:47.120 --> 26:51.120
Just sneeze quieter, please, for the rest of us.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.240
Just sneeze quieter.

26:52.240 --> 26:56.160
Your vocal cords are still putting that stank on it.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.960
This is coming from Justin

26:58.960 --> 27:02.080
who used to do a drum roll before he used to sneeze.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.080
Right, I used to do a grill.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.080
We all get our attention in different ways.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.560
He did, he would go like, brr-chish.

27:09.520 --> 27:10.480
That's not a joke.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.920
He would really do it.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.160
He sounded like Yoshi doing a butt stomp on his grill.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.200
It was amazing.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.120
But I'm saying it was just a way to get attention.

27:17.120 --> 27:18.560
We all do these things in school

27:18.560 --> 27:21.680
and then we grow and we move past them.

27:21.680 --> 27:24.160
You have to stop sneezing so loudly.

27:24.160 --> 27:26.320
You're bothering everyone, please.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.080
Think about it.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.680
Just sneeze quieter.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.440
You can do it, I believe in you.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.760
You don't need to get in a sneeze fight with this person.

27:33.760 --> 27:35.360
This is a professional environment.

27:35.360 --> 27:38.800
But can I say something that doesn't bother me?

27:38.800 --> 27:42.800
If this person follows my sage advice

27:42.800 --> 27:45.600
and they start sneezing quieter,

27:45.600 --> 27:50.600
then his coworker, let's call that person Shimmy.

27:56.720 --> 27:59.520
So when Shimmy notices the next time you sneeze

27:59.520 --> 28:04.520
and it's quieter, Shimmy's gonna think that she's cowed you.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.000
Yeah, she's won through,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.560
I would say some very shameful play.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.800
Oh, then might I suggest.

28:12.800 --> 28:17.800
Now wait, now Travis, you started talking very quickly

28:19.920 --> 28:21.600
and sometimes when that happens,

28:22.800 --> 28:27.680
the sounds are funny, but the ideas are bad or challenging.

28:27.680 --> 28:31.280
Uh-huh, well, I think, no fear here.

28:31.280 --> 28:33.600
You won't even let me get through the sentence

28:33.600 --> 28:36.080
when I tell you to think about the ideas.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.720
These just be extremely challenging.

28:38.720 --> 28:41.760
Hold on, wait, hold on.

28:41.760 --> 28:43.600
My mind moves so quickly, Justin.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.000
Let me open a fresca, okay.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.360
Hold on, let me get comfortable

28:49.360 --> 28:52.320
because I've tried to help you twice preemptively.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.800
There will be no post-emptive help

28:54.800 --> 28:56.080
for what you're about to do.

28:57.200 --> 29:02.160
Okay, you're going to start sneezing quieter, but prouder.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.720
So when you feel a sneeze coming on,

29:04.720 --> 29:07.600
stand up, maybe put your foot up on the chair

29:07.600 --> 29:10.080
and spread your arms like you're about to deliver

29:10.080 --> 29:11.680
like an operatic solo.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.280
Like Scott Stapp.

29:13.280 --> 29:17.200
Yeah, sneeze politely, bow, sit back down.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.020
That's good.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.960
You could also just sneeze quieter

29:20.960 --> 29:22.800
and then Shimmy will sneeze louder

29:22.800 --> 29:24.240
and then come over and be like,

29:24.240 --> 29:26.080
looks like my sneeze was louder

29:26.080 --> 29:28.560
and then you gesture all over your desk and you say,

29:28.560 --> 29:30.560
yes, but mine was wetter.

29:32.880 --> 29:33.920
I hate it.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.360
Mine was so wet.

29:35.360 --> 29:38.080
So you can keep your decibels.

29:41.200 --> 29:45.040
Let's take a brief sojourn at this point in the program

29:45.040 --> 29:47.680
and go peruse the wares over at the Money Zone.

29:47.680 --> 29:59.840
Welcome stranger.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.800
Welcome stranger to the Money Zone.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.640
I'm very excited this week to tell you about Ring.

30:04.640 --> 30:06.480
Ring's mission is to make neighborhoods safer

30:06.480 --> 30:08.480
with smart video doorbells and cameras

30:08.480 --> 30:09.920
that protect millions of people everywhere.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.200
What does that mean, you ask?

30:11.200 --> 30:14.080
Well, you connect it to your phone wherever you are.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.920
There's a camera on the Ring doorbell.

30:15.920 --> 30:18.080
It senses motion or people can like, you know,

30:18.080 --> 30:19.680
push the button, pause up on your phone.

30:19.680 --> 30:22.160
You look at it, see who's there, takes videos.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.160
If you're worried about like people stealing your packages

30:24.160 --> 30:26.000
and stuff, which I always am,

30:26.000 --> 30:28.320
then this video doorbell is for you.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.240
Or if you just want to see who's at the door

30:30.240 --> 30:34.080
before you like get up and go open it, you need Ring.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.880
And so as a listener,

30:36.880 --> 30:38.960
you have a special offer on a Ring starter kit

30:38.960 --> 30:41.440
available right now with a Ring doorbell

30:41.440 --> 30:44.080
and motion activated floodlight camera.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.680
The starter kit has everything you need

30:45.680 --> 30:48.400
to start building a Ring of security around your home.

30:48.400 --> 30:51.360
Just go to ring.com slash my brother.

30:51.360 --> 30:54.080
That's ring.com slash my brother.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.160
Did y'all see a video guy made a box

30:56.160 --> 30:57.360
and it shot glitter everywhere

30:57.360 --> 30:59.520
and did fart spray when people stole it?

30:59.520 --> 31:02.480
I mean, yeah, I guess that's fine.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.320
How come I didn't know there was fart spray

31:04.320 --> 31:05.120
until that video?

31:06.320 --> 31:09.520
How did I not know that we have successfully synthesized it?

31:10.160 --> 31:10.560
I don't know.

31:10.560 --> 31:11.920
I guess they're just not on the blogs.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.080
There's no cure for canker sores,

31:14.080 --> 31:16.720
but we still, we made fart spray.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.160
Good work, science.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.760
Hey, here's one for Quip.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.440
I brushed my teeth with it today.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.800
These are toothbrushes that are battery powered.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.040
And used by Griffin, each one.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.720
They shake and shimmy in your mouth.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.200
They do a little cleaning dance.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.040
And you put it in there for two minutes

31:33.040 --> 31:35.600
and it has these sonic vibrations.

31:35.600 --> 31:39.280
And then it just gets those guys pearly white again.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.360
And it's wonderful.

31:41.360 --> 31:44.400
I'd like to travel with it because I have a little thing

31:44.400 --> 31:45.600
and it's like a cover for it,

31:45.600 --> 31:46.880
but then you can turn it upside down

31:46.880 --> 31:47.920
and stick it on your mirror.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.840
And then like it's a little holster for it.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.680
Like it's a cool cowboy gun.

31:52.560 --> 31:56.000
So if you want to get Quip and have a cool toothbrush gun,

31:56.000 --> 32:02.080
I want you to go to getquip.com slash my brother right now.

Do not be ashamed of your love for gore,

32:29.360 --> 32:31.360
action, sci-fi or fantasy.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.520
It's time to come out of the shadows

32:33.520 --> 32:34.960
because on Switchblade Sisters,

32:34.960 --> 32:37.200
we celebrate our love for genre films.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.800
I'm film critic, April Wolf.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.080
Each week I have a conversation

32:40.080 --> 32:41.440
with a different female filmmaker

32:41.440 --> 32:42.960
about their fave genre film.

32:42.960 --> 32:45.760
And we cover film craft, getting projects off the ground,

32:45.760 --> 32:48.640
working with actors and our general love for genre movies.

32:48.640 --> 32:51.120
I've had so many great guests like Heather Gramp.

32:51.120 --> 32:53.280
In the past, it's like so many films are made by men

32:53.280 --> 32:56.320
that the female point of view is not always respected,

32:56.320 --> 32:58.800
which is why all these stories haven't come out till now.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.880
Jennifer's body director, Karan Kusama.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.120
I think there's a lot more fantasy

33:03.120 --> 33:07.040
and a lot more expectation projected onto a woman director.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.960
Comedian and actor, Kate Berlant.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.280
I mean, it sounds so cheesy to talk about it in yourself.

33:11.280 --> 33:14.080
Like you just keep going, you know, I'm just a vessel.

33:14.080 --> 33:16.880
Like I just do it, you know, I don't think,

33:16.880 --> 33:18.800
but like that is what it is.

33:18.800 --> 33:19.680
And many others.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.840
So check out Switchblade Sisters every Thursday

33:21.840 --> 33:50.320
on MaximumFun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.280
It's getting more operatic.

33:54.240 --> 33:58.880
That was very like a, like a medieval,

33:58.880 --> 34:01.280
you know, Dark Ages fife-ing.

34:01.280 --> 34:02.240
I enjoyed it.

34:02.240 --> 34:06.560
I have two this week and some we do them as a combo

34:06.560 --> 34:08.640
because they're both less substantial.

34:08.640 --> 34:10.800
Either one would have been a good Munch Squad Junior,

34:11.440 --> 34:13.280
but I'm going to do one.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.440
Is that the conversion rate to Munch Squad Juniors

34:15.440 --> 34:16.720
equals one Munch Squad Senior?

34:16.720 --> 34:18.000
This one kind of bums me out,

34:18.000 --> 34:19.520
but I'm going to go ahead and say it.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.320
Oh no.

34:20.320 --> 34:24.800
Tim Tebow teams with Core Life Eatery for Food Revolution.

34:24.800 --> 34:25.520
Oh no.

34:25.520 --> 34:28.080
Welcome to Tim Tebow's Food Revolution.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.640
The first paragraph of this fast food press release says,

34:33.200 --> 34:35.840
what if you could change your life in just 21 days?

34:36.480 --> 34:39.520
Professional athlete Tim Tebow is teaming up

34:39.520 --> 34:42.960
with Core Life Eatery, an active lifestyle restaurant,

34:42.960 --> 34:44.960
offering a variety of greens, grains,

34:44.960 --> 34:47.200
and broth-based dishes to do exactly that.

34:47.200 --> 34:50.080
Tebow is taking the Core Life Challenge

34:50.640 --> 34:52.160
and it wants you to join him.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.080
So this is a...

34:56.400 --> 35:00.480
The Core Life Challenge is a 21-day food revolution.

35:00.480 --> 35:02.560
All of these days I'm assuming you will eat

35:02.560 --> 35:04.800
at Core Life Eatery, I have to imagine.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.520
That's a brand built around clean eating,

35:07.520 --> 35:08.960
which doesn't mean anything.

35:08.960 --> 35:11.360
Wait, it's a 21-day challenge

35:11.360 --> 35:13.600
where you have to eat at this same restaurant every day?

35:13.600 --> 35:14.800
Yes, I know.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.080
What a great challenge.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.880
If that's the case, then I unconsciously did

35:18.880 --> 35:22.000
the Wendy's Challenge in college a lot.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.440
So it's promoting overall wellness.

35:25.440 --> 35:28.000
It encourages you to take control of your health.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.040
Although I would argue,

35:29.040 --> 35:30.800
if you're eating at the same restaurant every day,

35:30.800 --> 35:33.280
you're letting Tim Tebow take care of your health.

35:33.280 --> 35:36.000
Tebow takes the wheel.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.520
Me, Tim Tebow.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.480
Are you okay?

35:38.480 --> 35:38.960
Are you okay?

35:38.960 --> 35:39.920
I'm worried about you.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.880
I'm stopping you at the door with my football body.

35:42.880 --> 35:45.680
Core Life Eatery and co-founder Todd Mansfield,

35:45.680 --> 35:48.960
who spent decades practicing physical therapy

35:48.960 --> 35:51.280
and functional medicine, which means lying,

35:52.880 --> 35:54.560
is trading nutrition,

35:54.560 --> 35:57.920
design the challenge to provide simple guidelines

35:57.920 --> 36:00.400
to improve health and also presumably tricks

36:00.400 --> 36:05.040
to get people to eat at the same place for 21 days in a row.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.440
During these 21 days, you'll get recharged,

36:07.440 --> 36:09.520
refueled, not refunded though,

36:10.400 --> 36:13.440
and embark on your personal journey,

36:13.440 --> 36:15.840
journey towards living a healthier lifestyle

36:15.840 --> 36:18.240
and living in fucking soylent green,

36:19.040 --> 36:21.680
becoming the healthiest version of yourself.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.960
The challenge begins on Wednesday, January 16th,

36:24.960 --> 36:28.640
and you're gonna get daily emails with helpful tips

36:28.640 --> 36:31.360
and special offers to help you stay motivated

36:31.360 --> 36:33.920
and on track from Tim Tebow, I guess.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.240
Hey, it's Tim.

36:36.240 --> 36:39.040
Are you gonna come into the restaurant today?

36:39.040 --> 36:41.440
We're all missing you.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.840
Didn't see you there yesterday,

36:43.840 --> 36:46.240
and I'm worried you might be dead

36:46.240 --> 36:47.920
because you're not eating healthy.

36:48.960 --> 36:51.680
Here's a quote from Tim Tebow, footballer.

36:52.560 --> 36:55.840
For our best performance, we need the very best food,

36:55.840 --> 36:58.240
says Tim Tebow, who's credited here

36:58.240 --> 37:00.800
as a Core Life Eatery enthusiast.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.040
His parents must be so proud.

37:03.040 --> 37:04.400
Congratulations, Tim.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.680
Core Life Eatery provides the top quality fuel

37:07.680 --> 37:10.640
your body needs to detox, refuel,

37:10.640 --> 37:14.000
and begin 2019 by getting on the path

37:14.000 --> 37:15.520
towards being a healthier you.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.120
Detoxing, of course, can be performed

37:19.120 --> 37:21.120
by anyone with a kidney or liver.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.600
You don't need Tim Tebow to make you chicken.

37:25.520 --> 37:28.400
You don't need to eat Tim Tebow's special chicken

37:28.400 --> 37:30.880
every day to get detoxed.

37:30.880 --> 37:33.520
Anyway, what does it help if Tim Tebow

37:33.520 --> 37:35.360
massages your liver and kidney?

37:35.360 --> 37:36.160
Does that help?

37:36.160 --> 37:42.160
Can the three of us get Cleveland Brown's

37:42.160 --> 37:47.440
fullback, Refrigerator Perry, to do a challenge for us?

37:48.640 --> 37:51.920
And it's just like, eat wherever the fuck you want.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.520
And don't eat at Tebow's place.

37:53.520 --> 37:54.800
Don't go to Tebow's place.

37:54.800 --> 37:58.320
Don't go to Tebow's place for three calendar weeks.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.440
It's me, Refrigerator Perry.

38:01.440 --> 38:03.440
Just go to fucking Taco Bell or whatever.

38:03.440 --> 38:07.520
I want to meet the person who is like,

38:07.520 --> 38:11.680
oh, man, I've got to get my life on track in 2019.

38:11.680 --> 38:12.400
I know.

38:12.400 --> 38:15.120
I'm going to let Tim Tebow make all of my meals.

38:17.440 --> 38:18.960
So here's some more news.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.440
Fuck, don't let Tim Tebow lie to you

38:21.440 --> 38:23.520
and overcharge you for lettuce.

38:23.520 --> 38:27.120
Baskin Robbins adds new brownie inspired flavors

38:27.120 --> 38:27.840
to the menu.

38:28.480 --> 38:31.840
Boy, that is one pretty challenging inspired,

38:31.840 --> 38:35.440
I have to say, brownie inspired flavors to menu.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.600
It's like it has a spirit of a brownie

38:37.600 --> 38:39.840
without any of the actual content.

38:39.840 --> 38:42.240
Baskin Robbins is ringing in 2019

38:42.240 --> 38:44.720
with a brownie lover's dream come true.

38:45.360 --> 38:46.320
Brownies.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.040
Brownies.

38:47.920 --> 38:50.000
Hey, dipshits, we finally figured it out.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.840
We just sell brownies.

38:51.840 --> 38:52.720
Cool, right?

38:52.720 --> 38:53.520
Yeah, I guess.

38:54.080 --> 38:57.120
The January flavor of the month brownie bar mashup

38:57.120 --> 39:00.560
is a delicious combination of traditional chocolate

39:00.560 --> 39:02.080
and blonde brownies.

39:02.080 --> 39:05.280
It delivers on two delicious brownie flavors in one bite.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.200
Ice cream fans may also find themselves

39:09.200 --> 39:10.560
under a sweet spell this month

39:12.400 --> 39:15.760
as Love Potion number 31 returns to Baskin Robbins.

39:15.760 --> 39:16.480
This combination-

39:16.480 --> 39:19.200
New flavor MK Ultra hits the stores.

39:23.440 --> 39:26.080
This combination of white chocolate flavored ice cream,

39:26.080 --> 39:28.800
Agent Orange, and raspberry flavored ice cream

39:28.800 --> 39:30.400
with chocolate flavored chips.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.560
I'm gonna fucking lose my-

39:32.560 --> 39:34.320
Okay, I'm gonna try again, okay?

39:34.320 --> 39:34.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:34.720 --> 39:37.440
It's a combination of white chocolate flavored ice cream

39:37.440 --> 39:39.200
and raspberry flavored ice cream

39:39.200 --> 39:40.880
and chocolate flavored chips

39:40.880 --> 39:43.120
and raspberry filled chocolate flavor hearts

39:43.120 --> 39:44.320
and raspberry swirl.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.520
And it's sure to work its magic on every guest

39:47.520 --> 39:51.760
as it has already worked its hypnotic linguistic magic on me.

39:51.760 --> 39:54.480
Here's a quote from Carol Austin.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.440
Carol, hey, it's Justin McElroy,

39:57.440 --> 39:59.920
a local reporter for Munch Squad.

39:59.920 --> 40:01.440
It's January, right?

40:01.440 --> 40:04.080
We're all eating at Timo's place to get fit.

40:04.080 --> 40:08.000
How are you justifying continuing to operate this month?

40:08.000 --> 40:09.120
Should you not shudder?

40:10.960 --> 40:13.360
Who would pledge to eat more ice cream

40:13.360 --> 40:16.640
in this month of new beginnings and fresh starts?

40:16.640 --> 40:20.880
Well, Carol, her eyes dart back and forth

40:20.880 --> 40:22.480
across the room nervously

40:22.480 --> 40:26.480
before she hesitantly answers a sweat beating

40:26.480 --> 40:27.360
on her upper lip.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.640
Well, Justin, our mission is to help guests

40:30.640 --> 40:31.920
flavor every moment.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.680
Okay, Carol, let me stop you there.

40:37.680 --> 40:39.360
It doesn't mean anything.

40:39.360 --> 40:39.860
Go on.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.840
Our mission is to help guests flavor every moment

40:43.840 --> 40:46.880
and January's offerings are here to do just that.

40:46.880 --> 40:51.760
Whether your resolution is to, a silence fills the room.

40:51.760 --> 40:54.720
People wait expectantly as Carol Austin,

40:54.720 --> 40:57.440
vice president of marketing tries to sell ice cream

40:57.440 --> 40:58.240
in January.

40:58.960 --> 41:04.480
Whether your resolution is to reconnect with old friends

41:05.280 --> 41:08.800
or enjoy more family time,

41:09.520 --> 41:13.120
Baskin Robbins has something to help everyone hit pause

41:13.120 --> 41:15.680
and savor the start of 2019.

41:16.400 --> 41:18.400
Carol, it's a good try, Carol.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.600
It sounds like good ice cream.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.440
It sounds like confusing ice cream.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.840
Hey, gang, two things real quick.

41:23.840 --> 41:28.000
One, William the Refrigerator Perry played for the Bears,

41:28.000 --> 41:28.720
not the Browns.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.600
I just wanted to say, I just want to apologize to my dad

41:31.600 --> 41:34.080
for getting a football fact wrong on our podcast.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.120
And the other thing is-

41:35.120 --> 41:35.920
Hey, Griffin, hold on.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.920
Sorry, my neck cut out for a second.

41:37.920 --> 41:40.160
Before we get back to the show, I did want to mention,

41:40.160 --> 41:42.400
you know, I think you said William Refrigerator Perry

41:42.400 --> 41:43.600
played for the Browns.

41:43.600 --> 41:44.560
Ah, shoot.

41:44.560 --> 41:46.640
No, you're gonna get dad points.

41:46.640 --> 41:47.120
Yeah.

41:47.120 --> 41:48.640
Hey, sorry, I stepped away for a second

41:48.640 --> 41:49.680
to go get a glass of water.

41:49.680 --> 41:52.720
I did want to say real quick, Griffin, it was the Bears,

41:52.720 --> 41:53.520
not the Browns.

41:53.520 --> 41:55.440
Not the Browns that Refrigerator Perry played for.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.400
Oh, shit.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.560
Guys, sorry, I stepped away to get a screwdriver

41:58.560 --> 41:59.920
for some shelves I'm installing.

42:00.800 --> 42:01.600
Damn it.

42:01.600 --> 42:04.640
Earlier, you mentioned about William Refrigerator Perry.

42:04.640 --> 42:05.680
My dad points.

42:07.040 --> 42:10.240
They're flying through my fingers.

42:10.240 --> 42:13.120
Hey, guys, sorry, I just traveled back forward in time

42:13.120 --> 42:15.600
from the past where I just watched William Refrigerator

42:15.600 --> 42:17.120
Perry play for the Bears.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.240
What are you guys talking about?

42:18.240 --> 42:18.960
Ah, shoot.

42:18.960 --> 42:20.800
Hey, guys, I've become unsuck in time,

42:20.800 --> 42:24.000
and I think I just sired William Refrigerator Perry.

42:24.000 --> 42:24.960
Wild.

42:24.960 --> 42:27.440
And he had a birthmark shaped like a bear,

42:27.440 --> 42:28.640
if that means anything.

42:28.640 --> 42:29.680
Second thing.

42:29.680 --> 42:32.560
Everybody, please, Christ, go to CoreLifeEatery.com

42:32.560 --> 42:34.160
and scroll down to the bottom of the page

42:34.160 --> 42:36.480
where you will find a picture of Tim Tebow

42:36.480 --> 42:41.360
whose face is making a face as if you have just told him

42:41.360 --> 42:44.480
that everybody else ate all the CoreLifeEatery

42:44.480 --> 42:46.560
we got delivered, and there's none left for him.

42:46.560 --> 42:49.440
And he's making this incredulous face

42:49.440 --> 42:51.520
that is so incredible.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.760
It's so incredible that this is what they went with.

42:53.760 --> 42:54.960
What?

42:54.960 --> 42:58.080
Wait, what do you mean you ate all the CoreLifeEatery?

42:58.080 --> 42:59.840
What about all my orange drinks?

43:02.160 --> 43:04.560
What about my orange drinks and vegetable bowls?

43:04.560 --> 43:06.080
But I drove all the way here.

43:07.520 --> 43:09.360
I should have called first.

43:09.360 --> 43:12.720
The tagline that they've gone for with this challenge,

43:12.720 --> 43:16.720
by the way, is it says this like fourth times on the website.

43:16.720 --> 43:19.520
It only takes 21 days to change your life.

43:20.800 --> 43:23.520
Hi, that's not inspiring at all.

43:23.520 --> 43:27.120
I've never done anything for 21 days ever,

43:27.120 --> 43:29.120
and my life is a way.

43:29.120 --> 43:30.560
I mean, it is the way that it is.

43:31.360 --> 43:33.760
I don't even go to places I want to go to

43:33.760 --> 43:35.920
three weeks in a row, CoreLifeEatery.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.200
I'm gonna take this challenge

43:37.200 --> 43:38.720
and see what Tim says about the fact

43:38.720 --> 43:40.400
that I'd have to drive 500 miles

43:40.400 --> 43:44.560
to go to a CoreLifeEatery.

43:44.560 --> 43:45.760
Sorry, everybody who doesn't live

43:45.760 --> 43:47.120
in a major metropolitan area,

43:47.120 --> 43:49.120
your life stays the fucking same.

43:50.240 --> 43:53.920
Should I just go outside and chew leaves like a cow?

43:54.560 --> 43:55.360
Like Tim?

43:55.360 --> 43:56.160
Like Tim would do?

43:56.800 --> 43:57.840
Hey, I've got a Yahoo.

44:00.640 --> 44:02.160
I just love the picture.

44:02.160 --> 44:03.120
Ah, Tim.

44:03.120 --> 44:03.840
It's real good.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.320
This one was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

44:06.320 --> 44:07.440
Thank you, Graham.

44:07.440 --> 44:10.320
It's Yahoo Answers user Melanie who asks,

44:11.840 --> 44:14.000
I forgot when my job interview is?

44:14.000 --> 44:16.640
How do I go about asking when my interview was

44:16.640 --> 44:19.120
without appearing irresponsible?

44:19.120 --> 44:20.720
This is so choice.

44:20.720 --> 44:21.680
That's rough.

44:21.680 --> 44:22.160
Oh, no.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.120
That's rough.

44:23.120 --> 44:25.120
I'm trying to think of a wording.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.920
Hi, I'm calling.

44:27.920 --> 44:28.720
Can't lie.

44:29.280 --> 44:30.560
Can't lie, they won't tell you.

44:30.560 --> 44:33.200
Ooh, this is a delectable little confection.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.040
Yeah, it's riddle me this.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.320
Riddle me this.

44:36.320 --> 44:37.840
No, I did it first.

44:37.840 --> 44:39.200
But you didn't say piss.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.240
Oh, it's because it's New Year

44:40.240 --> 44:41.760
and I'm trying not to cuss as much.

44:41.760 --> 44:43.760
Could you pretend to be a cuss?

44:43.760 --> 44:46.640
Pretend to be a competing job.

44:46.640 --> 44:47.140
Nope.

44:48.240 --> 44:48.800
Now, hold on.

44:48.800 --> 44:52.480
I do want to hear what Travis thinks competing job is.

44:52.480 --> 44:54.640
I'm going to hire Henriette.

44:55.680 --> 45:00.000
So I'll interview her when you were going to.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.360
When was that?

45:01.360 --> 45:02.000
That's nothing.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.000
No, that's quite good.

45:05.840 --> 45:06.720
The name was Melanie.

45:06.720 --> 45:07.280
It's good.

45:07.280 --> 45:07.840
It's good.

45:07.840 --> 45:10.080
The idea of poaching a job interview.

45:10.960 --> 45:12.960
What about you call and say,

45:12.960 --> 45:15.280
I can't wait to start work.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.440
Let's move that interview up the sooner the better.

45:19.440 --> 45:20.640
You say when the interview,

45:20.640 --> 45:22.160
I choose the interview time.

45:23.040 --> 45:24.480
What are you doing right now?

45:24.480 --> 45:25.520
And then you knock on the door.

45:26.880 --> 45:30.480
I know my interview was supposed to happen at a later time,

45:30.480 --> 45:32.000
but I'm so horny for it.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.280
I mean, excited for it.

45:34.400 --> 45:35.200
Shit, sorry.

45:35.200 --> 45:35.760
Ah, fuck.

45:35.760 --> 45:36.720
Oh no, sorry.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.360
That I want to do it right now, please.

45:39.360 --> 45:41.120
Your interview was two months ago.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.760
You've been working here for two months.

45:43.760 --> 45:45.280
Yeah, whatever you're going to do, do it fast.

45:46.320 --> 45:50.560
Why don't you call the boss, okay?

45:51.520 --> 45:58.000
And you say, hi, this is Shellac from-

45:58.000 --> 45:58.960
Melanie.

45:58.960 --> 45:59.520
Oh, you're lying.

45:59.520 --> 46:00.160
It's a lie name.

46:00.160 --> 46:01.280
Sorry, it's a lie name.

46:01.280 --> 46:01.840
Yeah, go for it.

46:01.840 --> 46:02.240
Go, go.

46:02.240 --> 46:02.640
Okay.

46:02.640 --> 46:04.160
You didn't put on your lie voice.

46:04.160 --> 46:04.960
Yeah, so I thought it was-

46:04.960 --> 46:05.440
Oh, okay.

46:05.440 --> 46:05.920
Sorry, sorry.

46:08.080 --> 46:10.080
So you say, hi, this is Shellac

46:10.080 --> 46:12.000
from human relations.

46:12.640 --> 46:16.720
And I was going to get an edible arrangements

46:17.440 --> 46:21.760
for everybody that has a job interview this month.

46:21.760 --> 46:24.800
And could you just list them off to me with the times

46:26.080 --> 46:29.840
so I can get them one personalized

46:30.880 --> 46:33.280
and have it ready for their interview time?

46:33.280 --> 46:34.880
Now, I want to say, Justin,

46:34.880 --> 46:39.520
that the department human relations

46:39.520 --> 46:42.240
does make it sound like Shellac works in the sex department.

46:42.240 --> 46:43.840
Some sort of sex acts.

46:45.200 --> 46:46.480
Well, you could just say you work at-

46:47.440 --> 46:48.160
They're aliens.

46:48.720 --> 46:48.960
Okay.

46:50.160 --> 46:52.160
You could just say you work at Edible Arrangements

46:52.160 --> 46:53.760
and say you want to give free deliveries

46:53.760 --> 46:55.920
to everybody who has a job interview today

46:55.920 --> 47:00.000
because damn it, Edible Arrangements loves jobs.

47:00.800 --> 47:04.640
We're just so excited that the economy is thriving maybe.

47:04.640 --> 47:06.560
And our shit is really just some apples

47:06.560 --> 47:07.680
we dipped in chocolate.

47:07.680 --> 47:09.680
So there's very little overhead.

47:10.240 --> 47:14.320
Ask them, say we would like to offer our facility

47:14.320 --> 47:17.440
for you to do your job interviews in today.

47:18.000 --> 47:18.560
You know what?

47:18.560 --> 47:20.480
We interviewed Melanie for you.

47:20.480 --> 47:21.280
She's great.

47:23.120 --> 47:23.760
Hey, it's me.

47:24.320 --> 47:26.400
It's me from the bakery, Bakery Joe.

47:26.400 --> 47:29.600
I got a cake here that says happy job interview Melanie.

47:29.600 --> 47:31.680
So when do you want this dropped off?

47:31.680 --> 47:32.880
I like that.

47:32.880 --> 47:34.320
That could work too.

47:34.320 --> 47:35.040
How about this?

47:35.040 --> 47:36.240
Check this one out.

47:36.240 --> 47:38.000
Hello, Richard.

47:38.000 --> 47:38.320
Yeah.

47:38.960 --> 47:40.960
This is Dr. Frito-Lay.

47:41.520 --> 47:44.720
I heard you had an interview with Melanie coming up

47:44.720 --> 47:46.720
and I say just hire.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.320
She's the tops.

47:48.320 --> 47:51.360
Anyway, gotta go, crunch.

47:52.240 --> 47:53.760
Now that's assuming, I guess,

47:53.760 --> 47:56.160
that she's interviewing for Frito-Lay.

47:56.160 --> 47:56.800
Yes, right.

47:58.080 --> 48:02.320
You could fit in whatever you wanted to there.

48:02.320 --> 48:05.200
You could just roll up to like the waiting area

48:05.200 --> 48:09.200
in front of the office and just start sitting there now

48:09.200 --> 48:12.880
and just say like punctuality is really important to me.

48:12.880 --> 48:16.640
So I want to be here right when you need me for the interview.

48:16.640 --> 48:19.440
And they'll be like, it's in 19 days.

48:19.440 --> 48:22.720
And you say, well, good thing I brought all this soup.

48:22.720 --> 48:28.640
And then you show them all the soup that you brought.

48:29.440 --> 48:30.960
Exactly 19 cans.

48:30.960 --> 48:32.720
19 cans, one a day.

48:32.720 --> 48:34.160
That's all you need, folks.

48:34.160 --> 48:35.520
Hi, it's me, Tim Tebow.

48:35.520 --> 48:37.600
And I'm here to tell you how to flip your shit all around.

48:37.600 --> 48:40.160
It's your 19 day soup challenge.

48:40.160 --> 48:42.080
Don't eat more than one can of soup a day.

48:42.960 --> 48:44.240
Things are loaded with salt.

48:45.680 --> 48:47.120
Not Tim Tebow's soup.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.160
His is made out of football sweat.

48:50.160 --> 48:52.480
So today I went to New York City.

48:52.480 --> 48:55.040
I almost said Gatorade because you said football sweat.

48:55.680 --> 48:58.960
Today I went to New York City with my girlfriend

48:58.960 --> 49:01.120
and we decided to take a short taxi drive

49:02.160 --> 49:03.360
rather than take the subway.

49:04.240 --> 49:06.560
However, a taxi rear into the city bus.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.080
Oh shit, geez.

49:08.080 --> 49:10.960
The driver has jumped out and screaming at the bus driver.

49:10.960 --> 49:12.320
Now we're sitting in the back arguing

49:12.320 --> 49:14.400
whether we have to pay for our ride still

49:14.400 --> 49:17.040
and whether or not we should flee before the police arrive.

49:17.680 --> 49:18.880
Brothers, help us.

49:18.880 --> 49:22.720
And that's from traumatized taxi travelers in New York City.

49:22.720 --> 49:23.520
I'm assuming-

49:23.520 --> 49:26.240
There's gotta be a law on this one.

49:26.240 --> 49:29.840
The typing of the question, I'm assuming was therapeutic for you

49:29.840 --> 49:31.840
in that once you finish typing it, you're like,

49:31.840 --> 49:35.440
well, we certainly do have to stay here at the cab, don't we?

49:35.440 --> 49:37.200
We really don't have a lot of options here.

49:38.080 --> 49:42.000
Derek Scott, we don't have to spend a lot of time on this one, gang.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.840
I'm almost a hundred percent certain

49:43.840 --> 49:46.560
you are not the first people to be in a cab accident.

49:46.560 --> 49:50.400
There has to be precedent for this one, I think.

49:50.400 --> 49:51.440
I don't know.

49:51.440 --> 49:53.920
The good news is if you do run away,

49:53.920 --> 49:55.920
what's the cab driver gonna do?

49:55.920 --> 49:57.280
File you in their cab?

49:57.280 --> 49:58.720
Don't rip off cab drivers.

49:58.720 --> 50:00.480
We should be explicitly clear

50:00.480 --> 50:02.320
that you shouldn't rip off cab drivers.

50:02.320 --> 50:05.280
It's a question of what do they owe you

50:05.280 --> 50:07.520
they made you be in a crash.

50:07.520 --> 50:10.240
How long were you in the cab before that?

50:10.240 --> 50:12.560
Like, were you almost to your destination?

50:12.560 --> 50:14.320
Then you need to stay and pay.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.720
If it's like you just sat down in the cab,

50:16.720 --> 50:19.280
turn a corner, hit a buzz, move it along.

50:19.280 --> 50:21.920
Did you just maybe ask the taxi driver

50:21.920 --> 50:23.360
who's having a very bad day.

50:23.360 --> 50:24.880
Oh yes.

50:24.880 --> 50:26.720
You should probably ask them.

50:27.360 --> 50:28.480
You are a witness though.

50:29.040 --> 50:30.800
You are a witness to the crime.

50:30.800 --> 50:33.040
I don't think you can flee because you witnessed it.

50:33.760 --> 50:36.240
It wasn't a crime as much as it was a New York whoopsie.

50:36.800 --> 50:38.800
Okay, you're a witness to the whoopsie.

50:38.800 --> 50:40.320
In a New York whoopsie.

50:41.600 --> 50:44.880
Guys, if I ever make a fourth album,

50:44.880 --> 50:47.600
witness to the whoopsie is just about the best name

50:47.600 --> 50:48.480
I can come up with.

50:49.680 --> 50:50.240
Dang it.

50:50.240 --> 50:53.440
I was a witness to the whoopsie.

50:56.480 --> 50:59.280
Yeah, ask the cab driver or Google it.

50:59.280 --> 51:00.240
What do you do if you're,

51:00.240 --> 51:01.840
I'll fucking Google it for you here.

51:01.840 --> 51:02.720
Let me just do it.

51:02.720 --> 51:05.200
I don't want to get snide, but what do you do?

51:06.720 --> 51:10.960
Do you do, geez, type much?

51:10.960 --> 51:20.560
If you're in a cab and it gets in a New York whoopsie.

51:20.560 --> 51:23.120
Griffin, also search how to be on Cash Cab.

51:24.560 --> 51:26.000
Is it like a submission thing

51:26.000 --> 51:27.760
or do they just randomly pick people up?

51:28.320 --> 51:31.920
I mean, there's a whole website here called Justia,

51:31.920 --> 51:33.440
which may be Justin's website,

51:33.440 --> 51:36.320
but he mistyped it at the end and put an A in instead of N.

51:36.320 --> 51:38.240
Yeah.

51:38.240 --> 51:41.040
And do you have to pay though?

51:41.040 --> 51:42.080
To be on Cash Cab?

51:44.160 --> 51:45.280
If you lose Cash Cab,

51:45.280 --> 51:47.280
do you have to pay when you get to your destination?

51:47.280 --> 51:48.800
Do they drop you off if you lose

51:48.800 --> 51:50.400
and you don't get to go to your destination?

51:50.400 --> 51:51.920
I've never watched Cash Cab.

51:52.800 --> 51:54.400
Oh, I think my Skype might've cut out.

51:54.400 --> 51:55.440
Can you guys not hear me?

51:55.440 --> 51:56.800
Yeah, we can hear you, Trav.

52:00.240 --> 52:01.600
Here's another question.

52:01.600 --> 52:02.080
Pay them.

52:02.080 --> 52:04.240
I just decided to pay the cab.

52:04.240 --> 52:06.000
Look at the meter, pay with there.

52:06.000 --> 52:06.720
Pay the cab.

52:06.720 --> 52:07.360
Yes.

52:07.360 --> 52:09.200
A while ago, I folded an...

52:09.200 --> 52:11.360
Oh, but wait, they don't have cash.

52:11.360 --> 52:13.120
They were planning on using a card.

52:13.120 --> 52:14.240
Use the fucking card reader.

52:14.240 --> 52:16.640
It probably didn't explode when we were into this.

52:17.520 --> 52:19.280
That shouldn't look suspicious.

52:19.280 --> 52:22.240
A while ago, I folded an origami dragon for my math teacher.

52:22.800 --> 52:24.880
The teacher asked me if I was good at origami.

52:24.880 --> 52:26.240
I said, yeah, sort of.

52:27.200 --> 52:30.160
She then asked, can you fold books to make words?

52:32.160 --> 52:34.720
I socially napped and wanted to exit the conversation

52:34.720 --> 52:36.480
as quickly as possible, said yes,

52:37.200 --> 52:39.520
which was a complete and total lie.

52:40.720 --> 52:44.800
She gave me an old math book to fold into her last name.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.920
I have no clue how to fold books.

52:48.720 --> 52:50.000
How can I do this?

52:52.560 --> 52:54.560
Maybe, how can I escape this awful task

52:54.560 --> 52:55.840
I did not mean to accept?

52:56.960 --> 52:59.440
I haven't looked at the book for a week or two.

52:59.440 --> 53:04.880
I keep making excuses until I haven't started yet.

53:04.880 --> 53:07.680
It's from a clever name pun involving books or something.

53:09.040 --> 53:11.200
Can't even be bothered to make up a name.

53:11.200 --> 53:14.560
Bad enough that you're agreeing to fold books into words.

53:16.640 --> 53:18.400
Books already have words in them.

53:18.400 --> 53:18.800
That's right.

53:18.800 --> 53:20.800
Yeah, so you should just give her back the original book

53:20.800 --> 53:22.240
and say like, yep, there you go.

53:22.240 --> 53:25.440
One word filled book, hot and fresh, ready to order.

53:26.240 --> 53:27.120
I'm looking at...

53:27.120 --> 53:28.240
Fold books.

53:28.240 --> 53:29.280
I'm looking at it now.

53:29.280 --> 53:34.080
It's like if you fold a bunch of pages in a row

53:34.080 --> 53:37.120
in a way that then makes like a pattern appear,

53:37.680 --> 53:40.960
so you can like fold one page

53:40.960 --> 53:43.760
and that's like the very left side of the J.

53:44.320 --> 53:45.600
And then it needs to be a long book

53:45.600 --> 53:47.360
if you're spelling out Jonathan Taylor Thomas,

53:47.360 --> 53:48.960
like a long, long, long, long book.

53:50.560 --> 53:52.240
It's nice that your teacher said,

53:52.240 --> 53:53.920
oh, thank you for this present.

53:53.920 --> 53:56.880
Now let me give you a chore to do.

53:56.880 --> 53:57.120
Yeah.

53:57.120 --> 53:58.400
This present's lovely.

53:58.400 --> 54:00.400
Make me a bigger, better present.

54:01.200 --> 54:03.040
I mean, I'm looking at Etsy and we're talking about,

54:03.040 --> 54:07.680
this is a $40 product that you are giving to them for free.

54:10.960 --> 54:17.840
I could do one where I just sort of roll the pages a little bit

54:17.840 --> 54:20.000
and then tuck it back into the spine

54:20.000 --> 54:22.880
and just do that with all the pages and you give it back.

54:22.880 --> 54:25.200
And the teacher's like, this doesn't say anything.

54:25.200 --> 54:26.320
And you say, yes, it does.

54:26.320 --> 54:32.560
It says, mmm, because it looks like a bunch of Ms.

54:33.760 --> 54:38.160
Could you just wait until you graduate

54:38.160 --> 54:40.240
and not worry about it anymore after that?

54:41.040 --> 54:41.840
That could be good.

54:42.560 --> 54:43.920
You could also get a Sharpie out

54:43.920 --> 54:46.160
and write Derek on the side of the book.

54:46.160 --> 54:49.280
Ooh, or find someone on Etsy

54:49.280 --> 54:51.120
and buy the book from them already

54:51.120 --> 54:53.440
or send it to them and say, hey, will you do this for me?

54:53.440 --> 54:58.240
And now you're the middleman of origami.

54:58.240 --> 54:59.440
Why'd you lie so bad?

55:01.440 --> 55:02.960
I'll tell you what's worth trying

55:03.840 --> 55:08.400
is to go to the teacher and say, I couldn't do it.

55:09.040 --> 55:12.880
And I thought I could, but your name's too hard

55:12.880 --> 55:15.120
and it's got a lot of bad letters in it

55:15.120 --> 55:17.120
or from an origami perspective,

55:17.120 --> 55:18.880
it's got a lot of bad letters in it.

55:18.880 --> 55:22.000
And I couldn't do it and I tried, but I couldn't do it.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.680
And I'm sorry, but I couldn't do it.

55:24.640 --> 55:27.440
I decided instead to focus on my studies.

55:27.440 --> 55:27.940
Right.

55:28.480 --> 55:29.920
Because I'm a child.

55:29.920 --> 55:33.760
And then your teacher's like, my name is Joe

55:33.760 --> 55:35.760
and it's just J-O, so.

55:36.400 --> 55:37.600
But the O is the hard one.

55:37.600 --> 55:38.960
The O is a really toughie.

55:38.960 --> 55:40.560
There's a lot of curves in there.

55:40.560 --> 55:42.800
Give me angles all day long.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.840
Hey, why'd you lie so bad though?

55:45.840 --> 55:47.200
This seems like a weird one.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.840
I get wanting to get out of the conversation,

55:49.840 --> 55:54.480
but in my experience, no is the much better rip cord

55:54.480 --> 55:55.920
for pretty much most things.

55:56.960 --> 56:00.080
If someone tries to improv you and you say no,

56:00.080 --> 56:01.680
end of improv, you're out of there.

56:01.680 --> 56:04.160
But if you say yes and, now you have to, you know,

56:04.160 --> 56:06.080
what are you gonna say next about the grocery store?

56:07.120 --> 56:09.120
Here, Griffin, let's try it, okay?

56:09.120 --> 56:11.120
Hey, Griffin, are you any good at origami?

56:12.720 --> 56:13.200
You tell me.

56:14.560 --> 56:15.280
Oh, it's pretty good.

56:15.280 --> 56:17.120
Can you fold books into words?

56:18.160 --> 56:18.660
No.

56:18.660 --> 56:19.160
You fail.

56:19.460 --> 56:20.180
I hate you.

56:20.180 --> 56:20.740
You fail.

56:21.460 --> 56:22.740
You fail this class.

56:22.740 --> 56:23.240
Oh, no.

56:23.860 --> 56:26.740
You're out of school now and you're off the football team.

56:27.380 --> 56:27.940
Okay.

56:27.940 --> 56:28.500
Quarterback.

56:28.500 --> 56:29.300
All right, let me try.

56:29.300 --> 56:31.540
The conversation's still over though, isn't it?

56:31.540 --> 56:32.660
Trav, let me try.

56:32.660 --> 56:33.860
Ask me, Trav.

56:33.860 --> 56:34.580
Okay.

56:34.580 --> 56:36.100
Hey, are you any good at origami?

56:36.100 --> 56:36.580
Hell yeah.

56:37.940 --> 56:38.980
Well, don't curse.

56:38.980 --> 56:39.540
We're in school.

56:40.260 --> 56:40.820
Fuck yeah.

56:40.820 --> 56:41.860
Fuck yeah, dude.

56:41.860 --> 56:44.340
Hey, hey, I heard that, Jared.

56:44.340 --> 56:45.140
Get to math.

56:45.140 --> 56:48.660
Is he fucking, is origami Steve good at origami?

56:48.660 --> 56:50.180
Dumb fucking question.

56:50.180 --> 56:50.820
Think about it.

56:50.820 --> 56:52.900
Think about it with your fucking brain before you-

56:52.900 --> 56:54.660
Get out of here, cursing Jerry.

56:54.660 --> 56:56.740
Cursing Jerry's vaping everywhere.

56:57.700 --> 57:00.180
Yeah, I'm trying to talk to origami Steve.

57:00.180 --> 57:02.740
Oh, shit, he's folding up my vape fog in the air.

57:03.380 --> 57:04.260
Don't curse.

57:05.220 --> 57:07.060
I'm gonna send you to the principal's office.

57:09.780 --> 57:10.660
Get out of here.

57:11.700 --> 57:12.260
No, I'm sorry.

57:12.260 --> 57:13.060
Origami Steve.

57:13.060 --> 57:13.560
Yeah.

57:13.560 --> 57:15.320
I know you're good at origami.

57:15.320 --> 57:15.800
Mm-hmm.

57:15.800 --> 57:16.840
Can you fold books into origami?

57:16.840 --> 57:19.320
He's the fucking best at origami.

57:19.320 --> 57:20.440
I swear to God.

57:21.320 --> 57:24.120
Cursing Jerry, I'll call your dad.

57:28.520 --> 57:29.160
Okay.

57:29.160 --> 57:31.720
Can you fold books into origami?

57:31.720 --> 57:32.920
I'll call your dad.

57:33.880 --> 57:35.160
Get to lunch.

57:35.160 --> 57:35.480
Okay.

57:37.160 --> 57:38.440
It's Taco Tuesday.

57:39.880 --> 57:40.680
Fuck yeah, dude.

57:40.680 --> 57:41.180
Okay.

57:43.240 --> 57:44.840
Now, can you fold books into words?

57:44.840 --> 57:45.640
Only Bibles.

57:52.600 --> 57:53.800
You sit there in silence.

57:55.480 --> 57:58.120
See what tough Ms. Teacher wants to do then.

57:59.400 --> 58:04.520
See how much she'd love to see her name represented in the art of the falling page

58:04.520 --> 58:07.560
if she's willing to destroy God's beautiful, perfect word.

58:08.440 --> 58:10.120
Let's end this episode.

58:10.120 --> 58:10.600
Hell yeah.

58:10.600 --> 58:11.080
Yeah.

58:11.080 --> 58:12.280
This has been so much fun.

58:12.280 --> 58:13.560
Thank you all for hanging out with us.

58:13.560 --> 58:14.680
We love you very much.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.080
We had a really fun 2018 with you,

58:19.080 --> 58:22.360
and we hope that we're going to have a great year together, us and you.

58:23.160 --> 58:31.080
If you are anywhere near New Orleans, the NOLA, I believe.

58:31.080 --> 58:31.720
Mm-hmm.

58:31.720 --> 58:32.760
As I believe they call it.

58:32.760 --> 58:33.400
As they call it.

58:33.400 --> 58:34.440
Or maybe just NOLA.

58:34.440 --> 58:35.720
I don't actually know.

58:35.720 --> 58:38.440
If you're anywhere near there or Birmingham, Alabama,

58:38.440 --> 58:40.040
we're going to be headed your way.

58:40.040 --> 58:42.680
So please come see us.

58:43.640 --> 58:48.040
If you head to McElroy.family, you can find the tour section there,

58:48.040 --> 58:51.080
and you can see the places that we are going to be.

58:51.640 --> 58:56.600
And that is going to be Birmingham on February 7th,

58:57.640 --> 59:02.840
and then New Orleans on February 9th with The Adventure Zone on February 10th

59:02.840 --> 59:06.040
with MBM all shows starting at 7 p.m.

59:06.040 --> 59:11.480
And it will be very fun, and we hope that you will come and join us

59:11.480 --> 59:12.760
because we're really looking forward to it.

59:12.760 --> 59:13.960
We've never been in that area.

59:13.960 --> 59:16.280
I've never visited either of those cities.

59:16.280 --> 59:19.480
So it's going to be a hoot and a half.

59:20.040 --> 59:27.320
Also, even before that, here in January, you can come see Sawbones at Sketchfest,

59:27.320 --> 59:31.640
the California Academy of Sciences on January 17th.

59:31.640 --> 59:36.360
January 17th, it's a big show with us,

59:36.360 --> 59:40.040
and Roderick's going to be there with Omnibus,

59:40.600 --> 59:44.280
and you should know this, and John the Colton,

59:44.280 --> 59:46.680
Paul and Storm, and a lot of other cool folks.

59:46.680 --> 59:50.440
So you go to Sketchfest website, get tickets for that.

59:50.440 --> 59:55.720
Also, last thing, you can get remote attendance or in-person attendance,

59:55.720 --> 01:00:03.080
I guess, for PodCon that's going to be January 19th through the 20th.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.520
And there's a lot of different panels you can see and stuff like that.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.920
And you can get remote attendance if you go to the PodCon website,

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.280
which is podcon.com.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.200
So go for it.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.840
And Justin mentioned earlier, our website, macroid.family,

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.520
got a bunch of stuff on there.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.680
If you want to find out more about our shows or get the newest merch,

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.600
we have a new pin for January.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.880
It is a stylish pin that says UNLESS on it.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:26.600
It's real slick.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.480
Yeah, that's all at macroid.family,

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.560
and thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.800
Maximumfun.org, check out all the great shows there.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.440
Thanks to John Roderick and The Long Winters

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.120
for the use of our theme song,

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.840
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:44.920
It's very, very good, the song is, and the album, and the band,

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.160
and you should go get the whole discography.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.000
So y'all want the final?

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:49.800
Yes.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.960
I was sent in by Megan. Thank you, Megan.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.040
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.200
Muscley James is back on my screen. Thank you.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.680
Ooh, two for Muscley James.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.440
He's really curious, and he asks,

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.720
how many rocks can you fit in your backpack?

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:09.160
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.440
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.320
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.360
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:21.960
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.800
Best comedy at the British Podcast Awards in 2017 and 2018.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.480
Also, I love it.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:52.680
There were no horses in this country until the mid to late 60s.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.600
Specialist bovine ass vet.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.120
Both of his eyes are squid's eyes.

Download it today.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.840
That's the Beef and Dairy Network podcast from Maximumfun.org.

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.920
Also, maybe start at episode one or weirdly, episode 36,

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:44.680
which for some reason requires no knowledge of the rest of the show.
