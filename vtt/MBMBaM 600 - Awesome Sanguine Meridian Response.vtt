00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 01:16.980
Hello and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show from the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:16.980 --> 01:22.660
I'm Travis McElroy the Experienced. And I'm sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

01:23.380 --> 01:31.380
Maybe I should just do like Travis the Middlest. Maybe. Anyways, I got bad news guys. I'm so P.O.ed right now

01:32.460 --> 01:38.420
It's our 600th episode big. This is big. This is big, right? The title the title of the email

01:38.420 --> 01:43.300
You sent us with the questions this morning was it's episode 600. Whoops cuz we forgot.

01:43.300 --> 01:49.300
No, I didn't forget this the whoops the whoops comes from this Griffin. I had so much planned

01:49.380 --> 01:54.600
Yeah, I had I was I had like I trained these drones to do a whole thing

01:54.820 --> 01:59.180
I don't think you trained drones. I spent months training the drones.

02:00.060 --> 02:05.900
I like had hired some dancers to do like backup dancing for us for the whole episode. Just I got it

02:05.900 --> 02:09.540
Well, Travis, hey, there's an audio medium so we can say

02:09.540 --> 02:14.300
That they would never do that. No, they were tap dancers

02:14.300 --> 02:19.140
Here's the problem because I also got us like matching jumpsuits in triplicate each

02:19.140 --> 02:26.260
Oh our different moods and then our CFO Jeremy said that we couldn't afford any of that

02:26.940 --> 02:29.700
Fucking cancelled all of it behind our backs

02:30.420 --> 02:34.380
No, he did it in front of my face. He tore up all the contracts. Okay

02:34.380 --> 02:40.060
I was gonna say it'd be so embarrassing for like hit it girls and then the backup dancers like didn't

02:40.300 --> 02:43.380
Hit it cuz they weren't there. Well Griffin, they weren't just girls

02:43.380 --> 02:49.580
They were men and women and non-binary folks and like I well that's not that that goes expressly against my wishes Travis

02:49.900 --> 02:53.140
I'm sorry, Griffin. This was not just for you. This was for everybody

02:53.140 --> 03:00.340
I had a Mount Rushmore made out of chocolate that included my face your face Justin's face and orb the horse and

03:00.340 --> 03:08.160
And Jeremy melted it why the flamethrower and then he sold the melted chocolate back to Willy Wonka right in front of me

03:08.660 --> 03:14.260
Travis stories get a little for fetched. Yeah, I don't think it's all true all true. I'd so much

03:15.940 --> 03:19.340
Justin do you want to just do like a really half-assed?

03:20.100 --> 03:21.420
like

03:21.420 --> 03:27.140
obligatory send in the clowns I had an idea for another musical number we could bust out for this one and

03:27.140 --> 03:30.540
What's right? That's fun. I like the way you did that Griffin when you're like Justin

03:30.540 --> 03:35.700
Do you want to do something? But before you do I got something? Well, it's just I was thinking about sustainability

03:36.380 --> 03:38.380
You know me. Oh, yeah

03:40.140 --> 03:42.540
Then we're going green. Yeah, you know

03:44.940 --> 03:50.780
Doing just doing salmon farm. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah salmon farm to table and

03:51.380 --> 03:53.380
from the table podcast

03:53.380 --> 04:01.180
Toilet paper and this big one a carbon song our carbon footprint is like

04:01.580 --> 04:04.420
Great, so they're working on my carbon handprints

04:04.420 --> 04:09.340
So I was thinking we could hit him with something like this and then we could change just change the number every like hundred

04:09.340 --> 04:11.340
I was okay great

04:11.860 --> 04:13.860
36,000

04:14.540 --> 04:16.540
Minutes

04:17.060 --> 04:18.500
36,000

04:18.500 --> 04:20.340
jokes about

04:20.340 --> 04:24.420
ghosts or you know, like then we right now wait

04:24.420 --> 04:28.700
hold on I worry Griffin that that implies that we make one joke per minute, which is

04:29.260 --> 04:35.300
Just going off this episode so far not not true. Yeah, we're about three and a half minutes in and there has been nary a joke

04:35.300 --> 04:40.780
It's an average. Yeah average though. Oh, okay. So sometimes we do like ten jokes a minute, right?

04:41.340 --> 04:44.540
Yeah, all about go sometimes we do ten jokes per episode

04:44.540 --> 04:50.020
I'm saying but over 600 it averages out our list. There's probably

04:50.860 --> 04:52.780
Some of our listeners who are like, man

04:52.780 --> 04:58.100
I can't believe they didn't prepare something for this big milestone episode and it's like what have you guys prepared for us?

04:58.100 --> 05:03.180
Oh, why do we always have to throw our own celebration? That's fucked up, right?

05:03.820 --> 05:06.580
It's it's like we do this every almost two years

05:06.940 --> 05:11.860
I don't think that's too much to ask of our listeners to be like to you know

05:11.860 --> 05:17.280
Get a bouncy house or some shit for us, please. I was thinking about it, by the way

05:17.820 --> 05:21.700
600 in 12 years, right? That's pretty and alright

05:21.700 --> 05:25.580
So it's like six weeks away from our actual 12 year anniversary

05:26.060 --> 05:33.500
So like that means one we've had a pretty good track record of putting on episodes. We could have taken it way easier

05:34.940 --> 05:41.300
We've had six kids and we did not miss like we missed what like one or two episodes of this

05:41.300 --> 05:45.180
This is what I'm saying in 12 years. We could be up to what like

05:45.980 --> 05:49.460
624 600 so 24 episodes in 12 years

05:49.460 --> 05:53.860
That's if we hit when we get to like April 15th or whenever we started or whatever, right?

05:53.860 --> 05:59.580
That'll be like 600 and like five. This math is not fun to listen. I'm saying we've missed

05:59.980 --> 06:02.500
19 episodes in 12 years

06:03.420 --> 06:10.240
That's not bad, but we could have with missed way more maybe right now. We'll just take the next 30 weeks off

06:10.240 --> 06:12.600
That's now we're cooking now. We're

06:13.440 --> 06:17.440
You got my attention back now. We hit 600. Let's fucking coast

06:18.760 --> 06:22.400
Podcasts take a gap year to like go to Spain and find ourselves

06:22.400 --> 06:27.000
Oh, I would love to cruise on down to Barcelona and just like find myself

06:27.080 --> 06:30.880
I would love to take a break from talking every single day a gab

06:31.240 --> 06:33.240
Batico if you will

06:33.240 --> 06:39.640
Yeah, love that right just like oh Justin. He's silent. He's monastic in nature

06:39.640 --> 06:44.160
Yeah, and he and he has a beautiful cacti all around his home and he tends them

06:44.600 --> 06:51.300
Peaceful justice Justin saw that Eddie Murphy movie where Eddie Murphy talked too much and someone gave him a tree with leaves on it

06:51.300 --> 06:56.540
They represented all the words he had left and Justin said I'm gonna do that but in real life and completely voluntarily

06:57.080 --> 07:03.360
That's like a movie thousand words. He says a thousand words that he dies. Yeah, that's the actual purpose of the movie, man

07:03.360 --> 07:06.600
I would thinking of Pluto Nash, right?

07:06.600 --> 07:11.440
I would accidentally sing. We don't talk about Bruno to myself 200 times and beef it

07:12.880 --> 07:17.780
You only know five words. Oh, you would literally just say like we don't talk

07:21.160 --> 07:23.400
And I'd be like fuck that's six

07:23.400 --> 07:46.200
Oh, hey, we don't talk about shouldn't have wasted it on that fuck. Oh, you think I don't

07:46.200 --> 07:51.620
You think I don't know just the wrap in the middle of hook and can we call it that

07:53.680 --> 07:58.960
I'm pretty sure I speak quickly loose traveler does a wrap in the middle of hook and I think that's

08:00.200 --> 08:02.720
Shuffle you off the coil. No one's ever

08:05.440 --> 08:09.440
I bet he did. Yeah, I bet fucking John Papa was like check out this rap

08:09.440 --> 08:14.240
I'm gonna do and everyone's like oh fuck. Oh, no, John, please don't do this

08:14.240 --> 08:16.780
You're gonna ruin karaoke nights forever

08:18.480 --> 08:23.080
Happy 600 boys. I'm proud of you and us. Hey, thank you. I'm really excited

08:23.800 --> 08:28.240
Do you guys ever do people without kids ever ask you guys like so what kind of music do you like?

08:28.240 --> 08:29.960
And all you get thing is like well

08:29.960 --> 08:34.640
I've been listening to the soundtrack of encanto like on repeat for the last six weeks

08:34.640 --> 08:41.400
So that does that count? Is that the music I listen? It's either favorite music. It's it's fucked my my

08:41.400 --> 08:47.320
like music recommendations any any any platform is algorithmically picking like

08:47.840 --> 08:52.120
Music or videos for me to watch is is ruinous. I've even fucked up my like

08:52.560 --> 08:58.080
My my various cues by not switching over to the kid profile. Oh, yeah. Well, see I get it

08:58.480 --> 09:00.480
Hey, do you really really like?

09:02.360 --> 09:04.920
Fucking blippy. Yeah. Yeah fucking blippy

09:04.920 --> 09:11.400
Well, this is a blippy. What if this is the year that what if the next hundred episodes we dedicate to just Bippy?

09:11.400 --> 09:13.400
Bippy beef. Bippy beef

09:13.880 --> 09:15.320
Blippi beefing

09:15.320 --> 09:17.320
Biffing with Blippi happily

09:17.880 --> 09:22.920
Happily, I watch that shit and I'm like am I supposed to not like him and listen Blippi if you're listening

09:22.920 --> 09:27.960
Get it the fuck together fuck together. You're a mess dude, and you shit on your friend that one time

09:29.280 --> 09:30.680
Excuse me

09:30.680 --> 09:38.400
Yeah, before he became Blippi he did when what was it the the there was the viral sensation of like

09:38.400 --> 09:42.080
You're very still and then the Harlem Shake. Yeah, Harlem Shake

09:42.080 --> 09:48.160
It says the reveal was him shitting on his friend and then he became Blippi so Child's YouTube

09:48.160 --> 09:55.080
This episode is all for us. By the way, it's starting to seem like Child's YouTube sensation Blippi. Uh-huh dumped on his friend

09:56.280 --> 09:58.280
This is known

09:58.280 --> 10:04.720
By me that's even more reason for us to take this dude down a fucking notch. I'm just saying I'm just saying

10:04.720 --> 10:08.400
Do you guys ever watch Children's YouTube and think like I should have gotten into that?

10:10.120 --> 10:15.560
Every day every day every day. Do you know how many people are on there? Like hey, I made slime. Thanks for a million dollars

10:15.560 --> 10:20.200
Yeah, I'm gonna open up these toys to go. Look at this. Oh fuck. I should have done that

10:21.520 --> 10:22.960
well

10:22.960 --> 10:29.800
Instead I'm trying to wrap it up 600 episodes of hard work. Thank you. You're welcome

10:29.800 --> 10:32.560
I would like to sit on my comfortable laurels, please

10:33.440 --> 10:35.440
time to coast

10:35.720 --> 10:40.080
While I'm thinking about it, congratulations to Connor Aleph for booking Tom Hanks on the show

10:42.120 --> 10:46.600
Podcasting I think huge huge victory finally a celebrity is on a podcast

10:46.600 --> 10:53.480
Next if you haven't listened to dead eyes Connor show it is fantastic and we're so proud of him and Connor if you're listening

10:53.480 --> 10:56.040
If you could put in a good word for us with Tom Hanks

10:58.720 --> 11:02.360
If Thomas is casting his net as it were

11:04.160 --> 11:08.500
I'd love to get him on here if you could put in a good word

11:09.640 --> 11:13.800
these are like the guys who like inspired me to do it all and like I

11:13.800 --> 11:20.560
Wouldn't be here without them and like you kind of owe me whatever you want to say Connors up to you heroes of podcasting

11:20.560 --> 11:29.040
Hey brothers, I am an adult you can't you can't start sentences that way without sounding like you are two kids in a trench coat

11:30.360 --> 11:36.960
And I would like one adult ticket for an adult, please I would like to see this grown folks movie

11:37.200 --> 11:42.400
Please I am an adult making my way in the world and in conversation with my mother

11:42.400 --> 11:46.440
Whenever some significant problem arises to beer from bureaucracy

11:47.240 --> 11:49.240
Such as my apartment building

11:49.360 --> 11:57.100
Council or issues with government services. She has recently gotten into a pattern of telling me to quote go to the media about my issue

11:59.760 --> 12:06.780
Simply not sure how to respond or what to do with his suggestions do news outlets accept random people coming with stories these days

12:06.780 --> 12:13.340
Would any of this be noteworthy? What possible benefit could going to the media have that's from the unwilling correspondent

12:14.100 --> 12:18.100
When you read a good media, you're gonna get your story out there. Yeah, you gotta get your story

12:18.100 --> 12:22.900
Yeah, you gotta let people know what's happening make your voice heard right your voice is your most powerful weapon

12:23.380 --> 12:26.660
Make your voice heard about this to the people in the media

12:27.940 --> 12:29.940
Me and Justin used to be the media

12:30.540 --> 12:33.620
I regret too. I regret to inform everyone

12:33.620 --> 12:37.700
Yeah, we were you know cronies on the take and I

12:38.340 --> 12:45.060
think I would have definitely loved getting an email from somebody saying like my landlord is a real piece of shit and

12:46.500 --> 12:48.940
Then the story would just be like breaking

12:49.540 --> 12:55.660
Landlord is a piece of shit. And then actually that's true of every landlord. So I'm not sure

12:55.660 --> 13:01.660
It would be actually more news if it was like landlord pretty decent actually. Yeah, this landlord is pretty cool

13:01.660 --> 13:04.780
I had a leaky pipe and he came to fix it within 48 hours

13:04.780 --> 13:11.380
Love this I couldn't make rent this month because of various hardships and they totally understood and didn't give me a hard time about it

13:11.380 --> 13:14.740
at all my word is the landlord from the

13:15.500 --> 13:19.500
Spiderman movies and I love he's very he's very great

13:19.640 --> 13:24.260
The one bathroom is a problem. But other than that, it's not bad. Not bad

13:24.260 --> 13:30.060
I think by the way more you've made me think now Griffin more news outlets

13:30.060 --> 13:32.220
No matter what their focus should be

13:32.940 --> 13:34.100
slash

13:34.100 --> 13:37.740
Local issues. So if it was like video game journalism

13:38.420 --> 13:39.340
slash

13:39.340 --> 13:45.340
Local issues, it'll be wonderful back new Sonic game and also what's the deal with this pothole in front of Tom's house?

13:45.860 --> 13:50.700
Well, we gonna fucking deal with this and it kind of depends on where you're at like here in Huntington

13:51.500 --> 13:56.100
You absolutely could get front page with some yet a few days ago

13:56.100 --> 14:01.360
The front page story was a lovely for February morning at the skate park. Oh, that sounds lovely

14:02.380 --> 14:05.060
Whoa, wait, Huntington's got a skate park

14:05.740 --> 14:09.060
Yes, yeah. Yes, you guys you haven't been out there

14:09.060 --> 14:15.580
I mean, I wouldn't I haven't been there to shred just you gotta shred gotta be shred

14:15.580 --> 14:20.360
You what you're gonna leave it one shredded and then the City Council's gonna be like no one shredding on this

14:20.360 --> 14:26.660
I guess we better pave paradise and put up a parking lot turn into a fucking library or some boring shit

14:26.660 --> 14:28.660
Oh my god, can you imagine?

14:31.660 --> 14:38.260
Get out there fucking shred you guys listen, I know what you're saying you you only shred little now, but give it a year

14:38.260 --> 14:41.700
Are you gonna accomplish man? I don't go the dog park either. We got a dog park

14:41.700 --> 14:44.780
I'm good go fucking dog park. You don't need a dog to do that

14:44.780 --> 14:48.140
They that's what they want you to think you can just go and enjoy other people's dogs

14:48.140 --> 14:56.140
Is that a weird vibe the dog park be like just your scopes and pups

15:03.300 --> 15:08.580
As long as you offer to pay the dog owners like an hourly rate for you to look at their dogs, it's fine

15:08.580 --> 15:11.800
There's nothing weird about it extra for touching

15:11.800 --> 15:17.840
That soundbite Travis gonna

15:25.680 --> 15:29.100
That silence is Griffin debating whether or not to hang a lantern on

15:33.400 --> 15:36.440
I don't think that the people who need that soundbite

15:36.440 --> 15:42.880
Needed any extra spice like I think they heard it and they said finally he said it

15:46.640 --> 15:52.320
We're 600 episodes in are there any other wild shit that people have wanted us to say out loud that they can then just like

15:52.320 --> 15:53.800
have that

15:53.800 --> 15:55.800
for

15:55.840 --> 15:57.840
That would be a good episode

15:58.000 --> 16:04.600
Let me hit you guys with this idea. What if I did an episode that is like we're tired of coming up with it. Yeah

16:04.600 --> 16:11.640
Yeah, we let you we let the listeners write it and just like everybody gets to send in one line

16:11.640 --> 16:15.800
Oh, that's good. And then we'll just read all the lines. I don't know law

16:15.800 --> 16:21.080
I mean, I'm fine with just doing like a shot like mmm juicy right something that you can just like

16:21.640 --> 16:23.640
Snip out there

16:24.000 --> 16:26.080
Then it's turning into sort of earthworm Jim

16:26.080 --> 16:32.800
I like I'm saying like I think that extra for touching is something that people are gonna be able and when I say it

16:32.800 --> 16:37.240
Like that, I'll do it like extra position so that people know what I'm saying, but they can't use the clip

16:38.240 --> 16:41.760
But people that's like very specific and people are like, ooh, okay

16:41.760 --> 16:43.300
I can put that on my you know

16:43.300 --> 16:46.560
Only fans or whatever is a funny like like a joke click

16:46.560 --> 16:51.580
Oh, you know a lot of people have like cool animated GIFs and like soundbite jokes on their only fans page

16:51.640 --> 16:53.800
Yeah, it'll be it'll be like that basically

16:54.040 --> 16:57.240
Well, here's what we'll do Griffin from now on whenever we have something that we're like

16:57.240 --> 17:02.640
That's a great sound bite that people are gonna pull we'll throw some copyrighted music underneath it

17:02.640 --> 17:04.000
Oh

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
Like a bird but that underneath it right and then it's like oh, it's there but you can't use it

17:09.000 --> 17:15.280
It's behind glass now. You can't oh fuck. It's so tantalizing you want to use but you can't

17:15.280 --> 17:22.000
Because right behind it is Limp Bizkit's one of those days. Oh, I thought you said that Limp Bizkit wrote

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I am like a bird. I only fly away

17:24.000 --> 17:28.160
Well, they did but they didn't perform it. They did that cover that I thought was so good

17:28.160 --> 17:30.160
I'm like a bird

17:30.160 --> 17:32.880
A little something like this

17:37.040 --> 17:42.900
Any other I forget what we don't go to the media they have it hard enough already start your own media

17:43.440 --> 17:45.440
Do support local news

17:46.080 --> 17:50.240
Local news is very important. It's wow. Thanks. Wow. Thanks guys

17:50.840 --> 17:52.760
You know what you could do?

17:52.760 --> 17:54.760
You could take out an ad

17:54.760 --> 18:01.620
Mm-hmm that way you're funneling money into the pockets of local media, but you are getting the word out

18:02.240 --> 18:05.240
Interesting. Oh, hey my my landlord

18:06.040 --> 18:12.800
Dylan leaves his stinky sausage casings in the community trash can and I wish he would stop

18:12.800 --> 18:15.360
That's a trash can though. Justin link. It's the

18:15.960 --> 18:20.520
Community trash can Travis. Yeah, but you're not going to a trash can expecting

18:20.520 --> 18:25.360
Okay, I live in a hovel in the world the worst state in America

18:25.360 --> 18:30.600
I don't know how big city people live. I don't know if they have a community trash can

18:33.720 --> 18:41.200
Context clues you can figure out that if the trash can is stinky you can't complain about it. I have two trash cans

18:41.200 --> 18:50.880
Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah outside. Yeah big cans. Oh, yeah, I throw all my trash. Yeah with your powerful bags. Yes. One is stinky. I don't like to open it

18:50.880 --> 18:54.640
Uh-huh, and the other is not stinky. It's a fresh smell. Yeah, so I

18:55.400 --> 19:01.000
Preferentially will get as much trash in there. Yeah in in some mr. Good vibes as I care

19:01.000 --> 19:05.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah cuz cuz hefty stink over there. I don't like to open him cuz he smells

19:05.760 --> 19:12.400
You know anyone who has more than one trash can has a has a like starter and then there's a B-string

19:13.260 --> 19:21.640
Absolutely positively, but even the good trash can Justin is a trash can I felt actually really guilty because I took my huge

19:22.320 --> 19:27.200
Trash can filled with wood scraps up there and they're gonna pick it up thinking

19:27.200 --> 19:31.960
It's just a regular day of newspapers and bottles and they're gonna be hoisting about

19:31.960 --> 19:35.600
Three somebody building a bridge up here. Yeah

19:36.720 --> 19:41.160
Juice I think there are probably lots of people at home that know more about your sort of garbage

19:41.860 --> 19:43.940
preferences then like their own

19:44.800 --> 19:48.440
Yeah, and that's a great sign of a great podcast

19:48.440 --> 19:54.860
I think I make less because I've been trying to do more recycling. Oh good. Yeah, that's great. It's good for you

19:54.920 --> 20:00.780
God, you guys are really up on your fucking high horses today, aren't you? No, and I do pre cycling. Whoa

20:00.780 --> 20:04.620
What's that? I go through other people's trash and I take stuff out of it and I use that

20:05.760 --> 20:09.440
the best part about recycling is we have a community recycler you have to take it and

20:10.320 --> 20:15.360
Just I get like a free rein to just look at what other people are recite nice

20:17.240 --> 20:23.520
Does they get a few snap judgments about my community what kind of I mean what do they got going on in there just like

20:23.840 --> 20:25.180
sometimes it's like

20:25.180 --> 20:32.460
Wow, you guys eat a lot of little pizzas, huh? Oh, wow. You're really plowing through these things. What what could they?

20:33.840 --> 20:40.240
What do they have? I don't understand what box either like little pizza boxes. Yeah, like little pizza boxes

20:40.240 --> 20:42.440
That's good Griff. You put that together all on your own. Yes

20:42.440 --> 20:46.520
They recycled little pizza boxes, which makes me think that they ate a lot of little pizzas

20:46.520 --> 20:51.780
But who's giving out little pizzas in little box? I assume Griffin doesn't talk about like a frozen pizza

20:51.780 --> 20:55.520
You would buy from the store. Yes a dollar pizza like in college

20:55.680 --> 21:01.920
Okay, my daughter my four-year-old daughter came home yesterday and insisted that she had eaten ten small pizzas

21:04.640 --> 21:09.140
Her grandmother's house that she'd eaten ten small pizzas and she would not back down

21:09.360 --> 21:14.880
No, no matter how many times I kept pushing back. She said no, I eat a ten of the chunky boys

21:14.880 --> 21:18.200
Yeah, I love Cooper so much

21:18.200 --> 21:23.000
I ate a ten of the chunky boys. You did not. She did not eat ten pizzas. Does she mean Bagel Bites?

21:23.240 --> 21:29.100
No, she didn't. I got there before you. No, she didn't. She's talking about the little round, you know

21:30.140 --> 21:35.520
Like party pizzas. That's what that's what I'm looking about party pizzas. Yeah. Yeah. She said she ate ten of them

21:35.520 --> 21:39.160
That's not true. It's impossible. Nah, I said we'll say. She ate dinner very poorly

21:39.480 --> 21:45.640
So maybe maybe I mean more than none for sure, but no way ten, right? No, not ten chunky boys

21:45.640 --> 21:51.280
Our parenting styles are so different because I would I like would believe her, you know what I mean?

21:51.280 --> 21:56.880
Yeah support like go ahead and eat ten pizzas, sweetie. Daddy loves you. Yeah, you'll be president someday

21:56.880 --> 22:02.200
You're gonna need that pizza energy. Uh-huh. You're gonna be so big and strong with that ten pizzas inside of you

22:02.200 --> 22:04.200
Yeah, like Louisa as my

22:04.400 --> 22:09.960
Yeah, I would make it relatable and be like like how Louisa ate ten pizzas and then got super strength and then she'll be like

22:09.960 --> 22:13.540
That's where she got her powers from. That is not what happens in the movie. Can't keep talking about it

22:13.540 --> 22:17.440
Well, we don't talk about Louisa either Jesus Jesus who the fuck can't we talk about?

22:17.960 --> 22:25.000
Can I talk about Camilo, please? No can't talk about Camilo. Does he smell like the person he turns into?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.880
No, you can't. Yes. I mean he would definitely I mean, okay

22:27.880 --> 22:31.240
His physiology would completely adapt to that of the person

22:31.240 --> 22:36.720
He's copied including like sweat glands and like but not like the smells they picked up throughout the day chemically know

22:37.360 --> 22:39.120
His body knows

22:39.120 --> 22:41.120
Do you know I mean like his body?

22:41.120 --> 22:46.040
The clothes wouldn't smell like this. I don't wanna do this but his clothes

22:48.200 --> 22:53.040
Here's a question why yeah, here's a question no, okay

22:53.520 --> 22:56.380
That's a good question. That's a question. Stop it

22:56.880 --> 23:00.800
Do you guys want to talk to the wizard on this? Yeah, you always do it second

23:00.800 --> 23:06.800
I'm tired of not having the variety in the show. I'm tired of the predictability. Okay, whatever happened to predictability

23:06.800 --> 23:11.640
It's the I even knew that you were gonna do a full house goat joke there. Fuck. Thanks

23:11.640 --> 23:17.120
I've got my lips getting tired while kissing my husband lately. Oh, man. I've noticed that while kissing your husband, too

23:17.120 --> 23:19.120
But yeah, it's a workout

23:20.600 --> 23:27.600
Your husband's doing some stuff in there. Yeah, it's taxing heavy lifting. It's almost like they cramp up and get numb while we're smooching

23:27.600 --> 23:32.160
Yeah, maybe it's from talking or smiling too much throughout the day. It's full-time podcasters

23:32.160 --> 23:37.160
This is something y'all have experienced if so any suggestions on lip exercises or resting strategies

23:37.360 --> 23:43.200
That's from lazy lips in Atlanta, which I I don't this feels like a sawbones weird medical question episode

23:43.240 --> 23:50.160
But no you've come to the right place. Yeah, I thought well first we can show you the we do about 20 minutes of lip

23:50.160 --> 23:52.160
Warm-ups before every episode

23:59.280 --> 24:01.280
I mean this mouth don't quit

24:01.280 --> 24:04.760
Yeah, this one this one does not quit

24:06.000 --> 24:11.280
And I don't know if that's true for everyone apparently not I didn't think I had like a special mouth

24:11.280 --> 24:13.280
But I guess it's like pretty good

24:13.360 --> 24:18.040
Yeah, cuz it doesn't quit like it never gets tired. It's always hungry for more

24:18.800 --> 24:20.800
Yeah

24:21.280 --> 24:23.280
Podcasting oh, okay

24:24.520 --> 24:26.520
By heavy episode

24:26.520 --> 24:28.520
Yeah

24:29.280 --> 24:31.280
Yeah, I don't I don't know why

24:32.160 --> 24:34.160
What is what's he doing in there?

24:35.160 --> 24:40.700
What's he doing in there? What is he doing? What is wrestling? Is he making you do too much work?

24:40.740 --> 24:42.740
There should be an ebb and flow. Oh

24:43.000 --> 24:46.360
There's some people who think like when I do kissing

24:46.600 --> 24:51.840
It has to be bigger than the other part like my mouth has to get over the other part

24:51.840 --> 24:55.480
It's like a dominance thing where it's like I gotta get this mouth over their mouth

24:55.480 --> 25:01.440
Yeah, I'm glad we're talking about this thing. Yeah now in a perfect world when you kiss you you both would firmly

25:02.280 --> 25:09.400
Press your lips together stay still. Yes for an extended amount of time and then disconnect, right?

25:09.400 --> 25:13.400
That's the ideal but you're not always gonna get that obviously now, right?

25:13.400 --> 25:17.680
So sometimes it's about their lips go left yours go right, you know what I mean?

25:17.680 --> 25:21.760
And then you kind of do, you know the swirl right as you chase each other around

25:21.760 --> 25:25.080
Well, yeah, the the lips move around the tongue

25:27.080 --> 25:29.080
Yeah, obviously yeah

25:29.440 --> 25:33.120
And if that's gonna happen, you got to make sure you're moving at the same speed, right?

25:33.120 --> 25:40.080
Because sometimes if one swirl is faster than the other you're gonna catch up. Yeah, right and that can cause a lot of issues

25:40.080 --> 25:42.080
It's a big problem

25:42.520 --> 25:44.400
With our country today

25:44.400 --> 25:51.000
Thank you Griffin. Thank you for saying it. You know, a lot of podcasts are afraid of dealing with the like the tough issues

25:51.000 --> 25:56.720
Yeah, not here right whatever happened to good old-fashioned smooching kids today

25:56.720 --> 26:01.400
I have all these viral smooches that they do on tik-tok. I've seen it. They take their challenges

26:01.400 --> 26:06.080
Yeah, they take their lips and they waggle them back and forth around their knees, right? I hate that

26:06.080 --> 26:09.160
I don't know just I think it's gross and it makes me want to barf when I see that

26:09.720 --> 26:15.120
Absolutely press together count to ten break apart say thank you for the smooch

26:15.120 --> 26:17.880
Yeah, and then go about your day that part's so important

26:17.880 --> 26:22.080
Yeah, a lot of people don't do that anymore. And it's really been the death of civility

26:22.800 --> 26:29.360
Whatever happened whatever happened to this great nation of ours. Thank you Griffin people used to smooch

26:29.360 --> 26:35.300
I'm sorry. I keep equating bad kissing with and I don't mean bad kissing. I'm sure your husband's an excellent kisser

26:36.720 --> 26:39.600
If it goes numb, I don't know Griffin

26:39.600 --> 26:47.640
Yeah, knowing now numbness is not what we're looking for. Typically not ideal. Not ideal. Is he putting something on his lips?

26:47.640 --> 26:50.480
Is he smearing some toxins on there Frank?

26:51.280 --> 26:57.200
It won't it will let you do the stranger though. Oh, that's what it's like. Who's my husband kissing?

26:57.400 --> 27:01.000
That's your lips or not. I don't think that's how that I don't think that's what it is

27:01.000 --> 27:04.800
Are you are you kissing poison ivy or perhaps?

27:04.800 --> 27:09.720
Like a villain from James Bond. Did you ever think about that? Yes

27:10.480 --> 27:14.040
Because the cramping up that seems like a you probably you gotta get some more. I don't know iron

27:14.760 --> 27:16.040
vitamins

27:16.040 --> 27:21.960
Maybe just like some more you gotta stay hydrated. Gotta stay hydrated, but the numb is

27:22.640 --> 27:24.640
Troubling the numbs troubling

27:26.640 --> 27:33.780
Is your circulation good? Oh, yeah. Oh, that's interesting. Are your lips sitting dormant for too long?

27:33.780 --> 27:37.100
I'm just thinking about circulation. Oh, of course. Yeah

27:38.380 --> 27:41.420
So you're suggesting that they're not kissing enough

27:42.500 --> 27:46.100
Which is not not not on this. I would say not in a

27:46.980 --> 27:49.860
You can kiss too much in a short amount of time

27:50.340 --> 27:57.500
Right and then be dormant the rest of them you guys spread it out in an even like one kiss every five minutes

27:58.340 --> 28:00.340
for 24 hours

28:00.340 --> 28:04.540
An entire 24 hours. What's it doing? It's really guys

28:04.540 --> 28:08.940
It's really hard for me to give advice on this one without knowing what he's even doing in there

28:08.940 --> 28:15.180
Yeah, what is he doing in there? Cuz that's never been my experience. Are you sure he knows it's kissing?

28:15.780 --> 28:20.780
Like you're kissing but he's like wrestling. He's this is a challenge

28:20.780 --> 28:26.220
He's trying to win and he's like, oh we were kissing. Oh, I'm sorry

28:26.220 --> 28:31.820
I think that our listeners want to hear us talk about a kissing as much as I bet I bet they have had their

28:33.620 --> 28:35.620
For sure

28:35.660 --> 28:38.540
Yes, that thirst has been slate. Yeah, absolutely

28:39.380 --> 28:42.420
Okay, can we go to the wizard now? Yeah

28:43.540 --> 28:49.460
He's he's looking over me like I heard you say my name and I got myself prepared for it

28:49.460 --> 28:54.100
And then you didn't I made crudity and you know what happened? I prepared my physical form

28:54.100 --> 28:58.300
He turned my wife a new fucking frog and I know that and I think that sucks

28:58.780 --> 29:02.740
How does gonna turn our back how to spoil a chihuahua?

29:04.460 --> 29:06.460
Well, just leave it out in the Sun too long

29:08.500 --> 29:11.420
What happens to a chihuahua in the Sun

29:12.580 --> 29:18.020
Because of their size and lovable nature chihuahuas are both easy and fun to spoil. Well

29:18.780 --> 29:21.180
Chihuahuas love getting lots of attention so their owners and other people

29:21.180 --> 29:25.180
treats clothing and other gifts are some of the most common ways to make your chihuahua look like a

29:25.340 --> 29:29.980
Neighborhood celebrity take your dog out on adventures when you can make them feel even more like a prince or princess

29:30.540 --> 29:36.100
However, yes, keep in mind that some dogs may misinterpret being spoiled. They say like a old-timey

29:36.660 --> 29:37.740
like

29:37.740 --> 29:38.740
gentlemen

29:38.740 --> 29:45.220
In being spoiled and behave badly as a result such as by being aggressive or nipping. Oh that hey

29:46.140 --> 29:47.900
WikiHow yeah

29:47.900 --> 29:53.460
Can we just say it's wild that you're like they might equate being spoiled

29:53.740 --> 29:57.020
With being able to behave badly and get away with it

29:57.620 --> 30:04.460
Hey WikiHow those are often synonymous. That is how it is attached usually in the animal brain

30:05.340 --> 30:07.640
So give your chihuahua a big bed to sleep on

30:08.060 --> 30:13.380
By the way, the the undercurrent of this article is I wish I was the author of this articles

30:13.380 --> 30:20.180
Chihuahua cuz they are they would set me up with the sweetest fucking life the sweetest life of Zack and Cody like

30:20.820 --> 30:22.100
imaginable

30:22.100 --> 30:27.020
Chihuahuas like their naps and sleep 12 to 14 days on average. So you get big fluffy bed stack some soft blades

30:27.020 --> 30:29.100
But you said 12 to 14 days

30:29.980 --> 30:35.900
12 to 1 on average 12 to 14 hours a day on average. Did I say?

30:36.540 --> 30:41.900
Days on average. Yeah. Yeah, that would be I would love that pet. Where's your chihuahua on a pin?

30:41.900 --> 30:43.900
Oh, it's he's asleep for a fortnight

30:44.180 --> 30:46.180
Tis the season

30:46.220 --> 30:48.220
He'll be back on the 15th

30:48.500 --> 30:50.500
And then he's power

30:50.740 --> 30:53.680
When is my birthday? Well, not for three hounds wikings

30:56.260 --> 30:59.320
Give a take give a take three huns wikings

31:00.500 --> 31:04.460
Okay, get a variety. Don't give your dog a big bed. Oh, that's a terrible idea

31:04.940 --> 31:10.420
It's a little dog though. So it's like you're spoiling this. Yeah, but dogs need stuff to cuddle up against. No, not this dog

31:10.420 --> 31:14.420
this guy means this guy doesn't care about affection it cares about being a

31:15.620 --> 31:16.940
Boss, baby

31:16.940 --> 31:22.960
Chihuahuas are also notoriously cold all the time. Not this chihuahua because you spoiled them by keeping your house at

31:23.500 --> 31:25.500
97 degrees Fahrenheit

31:25.580 --> 31:30.080
That's the next dog's favorite temperature. Keep that keep that nest set

31:30.740 --> 31:35.500
Specifically to 97 degrees always get a variety of toys for your dog. Yeah

31:35.500 --> 31:38.780
I mean every spoiled dog has a big basket brimming with colorful toys

31:38.780 --> 31:44.780
Yeah, obviously that sounds like a vocal warm-up that you can do before kissing your husband a big

31:45.660 --> 31:47.660
basket brimming with colorful toys

31:48.700 --> 31:55.660
Serve food and water and customized dog bowls. I think a chihuahua is definitely going to understand what that means

31:56.380 --> 31:59.060
Pamper them they can see color. They can see color and read

31:59.580 --> 32:05.220
Now I think we can all agree if you grew up when these commercials were on there was a series of commercials in which dogs

32:05.220 --> 32:11.140
Were served out of a crystal goblet. Well, that was the fancy feast the fancy feast commercial and like what else would you?

32:11.780 --> 32:15.640
Serve it in right? I mean, absolutely, but I remember being a kid watching them

32:15.640 --> 32:21.340
Like that's fucking you know how when we eat a fancy meal we usually do like humans

32:21.340 --> 32:24.420
I mean do you eat it out of a crystalline goblet?

32:24.940 --> 32:29.860
Thank you for clarifying that when you said we I did mean you were talking about humans. Yeah. Thank you

32:29.860 --> 32:34.260
Okay, choose specialized collars and leashes for your dog again. They aren't gonna know that

32:34.260 --> 32:41.100
Yeah, I can now literally can't see that. You know that right? That's like behind their seeing like stuff

32:41.100 --> 32:47.840
Yeah stuff they used to see that. Well, I guess most of us use now we wear necklaces though. Don't we? Yeah. Yeah

32:48.300 --> 32:55.100
And earrings now, what if you got him like a collar that smelled like bacon? Oh that would now that's gonna go poorly

32:56.020 --> 32:58.020
into an

32:58.300 --> 33:00.300
absolute spiral of madness

33:00.300 --> 33:02.220
I

33:02.220 --> 33:04.220
Fuck you sell it to right

33:04.660 --> 33:07.760
Hey, you got hey, why are these other dogs biting my neck?

33:08.820 --> 33:11.020
You've turned you are the forbidden meat

33:11.660 --> 33:14.220
You are you the smoky secret?

33:15.300 --> 33:22.820
Set up a quiet area for your chihuahua to escape when it's stressed. Hey, that's not spoiling. That's just a good idea. That's

33:23.140 --> 33:25.140
Yeah

33:25.140 --> 33:30.340
Well, I don't know that's like saying like oh your kid is so spoiled sometimes when they're stressed out

33:30.340 --> 33:33.920
You let him just chill out and read a book fucking spoiled, man

33:33.920 --> 33:38.020
I feel like I can if find reasons to get stressed and basically every room of my house

33:38.020 --> 33:43.380
So I'm not sure that I have this and that's also dependent on the extent to which it is spoiling

33:43.380 --> 33:48.580
It's also dependent on the amount of space that you have available to you. Like if somebody walks in they're like

33:48.580 --> 33:54.480
I welcome my one-bedroom apartment and they're like wait, I think I had a two-bedroom. It's like well I did I have

33:54.860 --> 34:00.920
The bedroom that I sleep in which is also the kitchen and then over here is the room where my chihuahua

34:02.180 --> 34:05.540
Mr. Smooches goes just fucking chill out me an orange slice. Yeah

34:06.460 --> 34:08.460
And I really like that you

34:08.500 --> 34:11.080
Clarified that in every room of your house you're stressed out

34:11.220 --> 34:16.940
But like that's because the dog isn't aware of like any kind of geopolitical or like social issues

34:16.940 --> 34:21.940
Yeah, but I mean, it's the house. It's like obviously I can find a reason to be stressed out about that shit

34:21.940 --> 34:25.820
like non non-stop, but um, you know, I I

34:27.340 --> 34:30.660
Like I need an observatory or something. Oh, yeah

34:31.380 --> 34:36.100
Yeah, that would be nice. That would be so dope. Just go there and look at some beautiful stars

34:36.100 --> 34:38.820
I need like an observatory and a conservatory

34:39.740 --> 34:46.060
Any other like a lot of worries? Yeah. Yeah anything you got a laboratory. Yes. Thank you

34:46.060 --> 34:48.060
Yeah, you're welcome

34:48.900 --> 34:53.460
Do you guys want to know more ways that you can spoil a chihuahua? Yeah

34:53.980 --> 34:59.820
You guys remember that movie Beverly Hills? Yeah, obviously. Well, mr. Shivers has been giving me some looks lately

34:59.820 --> 35:01.180
And I feel like I haven't done enough

35:01.180 --> 35:07.580
Well, you should buy your chihuahua stylish clothing that fits and I love that they include that last part the fit has to know

35:07.580 --> 35:15.000
Yeah, right that actually explains a lot. His cape has been dragging lately. I've noticed that I don't give him chihuahua. Jinko jeans

35:15.000 --> 35:17.760
He won't know what he asked for him by name

35:18.520 --> 35:21.800
No, he did and it's weird that your chihuahua can bark like that

35:22.240 --> 35:28.120
No, I taught him to use the buttons, but to be fair, I gave him a button that says Jinko jeans. Yeah, that's true

35:28.680 --> 35:33.600
Set it. Okay. So now this is about affection. I gave a mistake every time he pushes the button

35:34.120 --> 35:40.320
Set aside time in the day to give your dog lots of attention. That's dope. Yes. Yes, mr. Jenkins

35:40.320 --> 35:43.680
I swear, I will have that report on your desk by the end of the day

35:43.680 --> 35:45.680
I just oh fuck I gotta go

35:47.120 --> 35:51.680
That's the snuggle noise you have brought your chihuahua to work with you in this example

35:51.880 --> 35:53.160
Yes, of course

35:53.160 --> 35:53.400
Yeah

35:53.400 --> 35:56.040
Remember to spoil your chihuahua even during busy days

35:56.360 --> 36:00.200
Creating a daily routine helps ensure your dog has plenty of attention no matter what else you have going on

36:00.200 --> 36:04.320
I love that at a funeral. Beep beep beep gotta go. Sorry

36:04.920 --> 36:11.440
No, you wouldn't go to the funeral, right? Someone would be like, hey, can you come to this cool funeral? I'm going to I'm throwing it

36:11.440 --> 36:15.680
It's gonna be awesome. I'd love to have you there and you're like you throw a funeral. Yeah. Yeah

36:15.680 --> 36:21.720
Well, what else are you gonna do Justin just phone it in? Come on, and then you're like, yeah, what time and they're like 2 p.m

36:21.720 --> 36:23.080
Oh

36:23.080 --> 36:25.800
That's it. Can you move it to like 530?

36:27.760 --> 36:30.240
So pet your dog give it belly rubs

36:30.240 --> 36:34.360
Yeah, a lot of this stuff is like whatever teach your dog commands for a fun way to learn new tricks

36:34.360 --> 36:37.420
I don't think actually that's spoiling them

36:37.420 --> 36:44.660
Yeah, thanks from maybe officer learning things for me is not like a luxurious like hmm

36:44.660 --> 36:49.260
I've earned this I'm going to you know, figure out how to tie a

36:49.820 --> 36:55.660
Ship ship knot. Wow, I couldn't even think of a name of like a sorry. What is it a ship slipknot?

36:55.820 --> 36:59.660
I'm gonna learn how to sing slip knots greatest hit monkey fit. Yeah

37:00.620 --> 37:04.380
Throw a chihuahua party with cake and presents. This is great

37:04.380 --> 37:09.300
Yeah, celebrate your dog by making a star for the day invite your dog's friends to come over

37:09.860 --> 37:16.940
Even the ones you don't like wrap up some nice presents such as new toys or clothing then get a cake made from safe ingredients

37:16.940 --> 37:24.060
Like peanut butter applesauce and pumpkin have a party for your dog's birthday a special occasion or for the sake of spoiling your dog on a random

37:24.060 --> 37:28.620
Day, I listen take it from me. This is so fucking important

37:28.620 --> 37:32.660
Yeah, don't make the cake look like the chihuahua

37:32.660 --> 37:37.140
It causes so much psychological damage when mr

37:37.140 --> 37:41.480
Shivers saw the other dogs tearing eating and tearing his form, right?

37:42.100 --> 37:44.140
It was a whole thing. That's me

37:47.600 --> 37:53.740
Take your child on a walk once a day that seems like basic sort of shit get a new yeah, that's not really spoil

37:53.740 --> 37:56.260
Oh, no, I don't spoil my dog. I don't take him out

37:56.980 --> 37:59.100
Spoil your dog by giving it food

37:59.100 --> 38:00.860
I

38:00.860 --> 38:03.900
Allow your dog the basic necessities of life

38:04.700 --> 38:09.780
Get a new household pet to keep your dog company. They are not gonna like that. Yeah, big-ass scary dog

38:09.780 --> 38:12.620
Yeah, what are you talking now? You're gonna have to get a smaller like

38:13.380 --> 38:15.380
Don't do a chinchilla. They're too clever

38:16.740 --> 38:19.300
You're gonna want to get your dog a

38:20.260 --> 38:22.260
lizard to

38:22.260 --> 38:28.980
Destroy well, you know eat not even eat. He won't be nourished by the lizard. He will just destroy it for fun

38:28.980 --> 38:35.020
I was just trying to say like if this was an animated feature and I want to give my chihuahua a buddy

38:35.020 --> 38:37.020
I think it's I

38:37.480 --> 38:42.100
Think it's a I think it's a lizard bring your dog with you when you're on the go in a little backpack

38:42.180 --> 38:46.340
They're gonna fucking hate that too. This article has gone off the rails

38:46.340 --> 38:53.620
Find new friends for your dog outside of your home. How I can't find human friends for myself outside of the home

38:55.340 --> 39:01.560
Well, this is your way in now you find other people with with puppers hey you seem cool do you have a dog no

39:01.700 --> 39:10.300
No, fuck our interests really aligned in a lot of ways, but you ain't got no dog and he's the boss around here

39:10.300 --> 39:11.740
I don't know if you could tell that

39:11.740 --> 39:17.400
Can you please help me get out from under my door? Like if you could help me escape this dog? Mm-hmm

39:18.340 --> 39:21.960
Let other people play with your dog of Chihuahua is friendly. This is a long article, huh?

39:22.700 --> 39:26.060
Seems that way upgrade to a quality dog food with healthy ingredients again

39:26.060 --> 39:30.180
If you know that that option is out there and you do have the means to do it and you don't do it

39:30.180 --> 39:33.580
I don't know that we're talking about spoiling anymore. It's spoil your dog by

39:34.380 --> 39:36.380
elongating its life

39:36.380 --> 39:42.060
And its legs and it's let's give your dog longer legs this Chihuahua. It's all at once

39:43.540 --> 39:46.220
About four or five feet tall that would be sick

Normal Chihuahua body with fucking legs that go all the way to the ground. It's fucking Slender Man shit

39:52.180 --> 39:54.180
This is a Slender Man's dog

39:56.420 --> 40:00.820
Give your dog special treats like peanut butter ice cream. We're really repeating ourselves now

40:00.820 --> 40:04.280
This one has stopped being fun bathe and brush your Chihuahua

40:04.280 --> 40:07.040
Bathe and brush your Chihuahua at least once a month

40:08.240 --> 40:15.040
Trim your dog's nails at least once every three months. Okay, this one wraps it up with like bare necessities shit. It seems like

40:15.960 --> 40:18.520
Anyway, it was better at the beginning. Don't you think?

40:19.120 --> 40:21.120

47:40.000 --> 47:42.900
is replacing the Zaxby's Club sandwich.

47:42.900 --> 47:45.060
This isn't a joke or anything.

47:45.060 --> 47:46.780
It's just like a programming note.

47:48.300 --> 47:49.140
Okay.

47:49.140 --> 47:50.980
If you like the Zaxby's Club,

47:50.980 --> 47:55.420
the Signature Club is replacing that menu item.

47:55.420 --> 47:57.920
Does it say when it's going to be replaced, Justin?

47:57.920 --> 47:59.940
So I can stock up?

47:59.940 --> 48:00.780
Right.

48:00.780 --> 48:01.860
So let me walk you through the chronology.

48:01.860 --> 48:04.340
Well, first off, a bit from Joel Bulger,

48:04.340 --> 48:05.860
the CMO of Zaxby's.

48:05.860 --> 48:08.140
With the launch of our new Signature Club sandwich,

48:08.140 --> 48:11.440
we've created our own Club remix.

48:11.440 --> 48:12.540
Hmm.

48:12.540 --> 48:13.380
Hmm.

48:13.380 --> 48:16.940
Signature sandwich, and turned it up a notch.

48:16.940 --> 48:17.780
Okay.

48:17.780 --> 48:18.620
That sounds cool.

48:18.620 --> 48:22.580
Knowing our fans, that's F-A-N-Z-O.

48:22.580 --> 48:24.300
No, they didn't say that.

48:24.300 --> 48:27.740
We are giving them something additional to rave about,

48:27.740 --> 48:30.780
and announce a well-kept secret.

48:30.780 --> 48:31.940
I killed a man.

48:33.340 --> 48:35.460
That doesn't have anything to do with the sandwich,

48:35.460 --> 48:38.060
but it feels good to get it off my chest.

48:38.060 --> 48:39.900
I killed my dad, Jimmy Hoffa.

48:39.900 --> 48:41.180
Anyway, our Signature-

48:41.180 --> 48:42.820
You'll never guess, or he's buried.

48:42.820 --> 48:44.860
Enjoy the sandwich.

48:44.860 --> 48:46.980
Our Signature sandwich is officially here to stay

48:46.980 --> 48:48.980
as a permanent menu item.

48:48.980 --> 48:53.740
In October, 2020, the brand sent out its Y'all Ready tweet

48:53.740 --> 48:56.300
and revealed its new Signature sandwich in test markets

48:56.300 --> 49:00.460
before rolling it out nationwide in March, 2021.

49:00.460 --> 49:02.940
During the test, Zaxby's new Signature sandwich

49:02.940 --> 49:04.820
exceeded the performance of the existing

49:04.820 --> 49:09.180
hand-breaded filet by 600% live.

49:09.180 --> 49:11.140
Get the fuck out.

49:11.140 --> 49:11.980
Get the fuck out.

49:11.980 --> 49:13.860
That's what everybody said to the original.

49:13.860 --> 49:16.260
How bad was your original sandwich doing?

49:16.260 --> 49:17.500
Plus a bit dog shit.

49:17.500 --> 49:19.900
Oh God, they replaced that fucking trash.

49:20.780 --> 49:23.760
And there's also a light version.

49:23.760 --> 49:25.300
Oh, fuck.

49:25.300 --> 49:27.020
Yeah, if you want that.

49:27.020 --> 49:28.820
What?

49:28.820 --> 49:30.500
Oh, shit.

49:30.500 --> 49:32.780
And now a quick note from me.

49:32.780 --> 49:33.620
There he is.

49:33.620 --> 49:34.460
Count Donut.

49:34.460 --> 49:35.280
Thanks for coming.

49:35.280 --> 49:36.120
There's my buddy.

49:36.120 --> 49:37.020
Thanks, Count Donut.

49:37.020 --> 49:39.940
I'm so excited to be back here with you boys.

49:39.940 --> 49:42.900
You know, if you ever want to just do the whole show.

49:42.900 --> 49:44.940
I always am on the whole show.

49:44.940 --> 49:45.780
What?

49:45.780 --> 49:46.620
What does that even mean?

49:46.620 --> 49:50.260
I lurk in silence waiting for my mom.

49:50.260 --> 49:52.260
But what about the part where there's only one pair

49:52.260 --> 49:53.940
of footprints in the sand?

49:53.940 --> 49:58.060
That is where I'm nodding silently instead of laughing.

49:58.060 --> 49:59.700
Oh, thank you.

49:59.700 --> 50:01.700
I don't get the most of the jokes.

50:01.700 --> 50:02.540
That's fair.

50:02.540 --> 50:03.360
I don't either.

50:03.360 --> 50:05.020
And I tell most of them.

50:05.020 --> 50:10.020
But the tone of her voice is give me A, S, E, R.

50:10.260 --> 50:13.860
Oh, I don't know that I'm crazy about that.

50:13.860 --> 50:15.140
It's no, it's not.

50:15.140 --> 50:18.180
It's awesome sanguine meridian response.

50:18.180 --> 50:20.340
It's hearing your blood pumping through

50:20.340 --> 50:22.420
and thinking, oh, daddy hungry.

50:22.420 --> 50:24.340
I love that.

50:24.340 --> 50:28.500
Do you human bodies like Krispy Kreme?

50:28.500 --> 50:30.620
You know that they do.

50:30.620 --> 50:31.460
Well, good news.

50:31.460 --> 50:33.260
It's time to ruin those bodies.

50:33.260 --> 50:35.940
Put them straight in the ground with this new one.

50:35.940 --> 50:38.380
Wait, is that what it says on the press release?

50:38.380 --> 50:40.100
Hey, Krispy Kreme got a new one out.

50:40.100 --> 50:41.700
It's time to ruin those bodies

50:41.700 --> 50:44.740
and put them straight in the ground with these, Donut.

50:44.740 --> 50:48.740
These coffin nails come directly from Krispy Kreme.

50:48.740 --> 50:51.740
Put this in your face and put your face in the ground.

50:51.740 --> 50:56.740
This is Krispy Kreme has partnered with Twix

50:58.380 --> 51:03.380
for first ever irresistible, caramelly, cookie-y.

51:04.820 --> 51:09.820
I swear it says this, cookie-y crunchy donut.

51:14.020 --> 51:15.420
I don't want a crunchy donut.

51:15.420 --> 51:19.940
Cookie-y, can you, how does it, how is it spelled?

51:19.940 --> 51:22.620
K-O, sorry, that would be wild.

51:22.620 --> 51:26.980
And also that would be kooky, which is a different word.

51:26.980 --> 51:30.060
Yes, this would be on brand for Krispy Kreme.

51:30.060 --> 51:34.740
C-O-O-K-I-E, what is the dash?

51:34.740 --> 51:36.060
What do you call the dash?

51:36.060 --> 51:37.020
Dash.

51:37.020 --> 51:41.140
Dash, I-E, cookie-y.

51:41.140 --> 51:42.580
Oh, they went I-E.

51:42.580 --> 51:43.980
Interesting.

51:43.980 --> 51:45.340
Cookie-y.

51:45.340 --> 51:46.420
Okay.

51:46.420 --> 51:51.420
Yes, oh, this is the wildest beginning of a press release.

51:51.420 --> 51:54.140
Always siding with deliciousness,

51:55.060 --> 51:57.460
Krispy Kreme is partnering with Twix.

51:57.460 --> 52:02.020
What is that, who is choosing sides in this battle?

52:02.020 --> 52:03.300
Where is this conflict?

52:03.300 --> 52:04.860
Count Donut, you're not around all the time,

52:04.860 --> 52:06.620
but there are sometimes where a restaurant will come up

52:06.620 --> 52:09.540
and be like, we wanted to do something shitty and bad.

52:09.540 --> 52:12.180
And it's like, oh man, why would you guys announce that?

52:12.180 --> 52:14.020
I guess they say, we'll see.

52:14.020 --> 52:15.820
Krispy Kreme is partnering with Twix

52:15.820 --> 52:19.740
for the first time ever to create three all new

52:19.740 --> 52:24.740
caramel-y, cookie-y, country donuts,

52:25.020 --> 52:30.020
including, boys, stuffing an entire Twix cookie bar

52:31.300 --> 52:33.460
inside the delicious Krispy Kreme doughnut.

52:33.460 --> 52:35.260
That's not how I would have done it.

52:36.220 --> 52:37.060
No.

52:38.060 --> 52:42.100
I feel so bad for the teenagers that work at Krispy Kreme.

52:42.100 --> 52:44.300
February 21st for a limited time.

52:44.300 --> 52:47.980
Yes, they make them put their own personal Twix.

52:47.980 --> 52:50.540
I brought this Twix from home.

52:50.540 --> 52:51.380
Put it in there.

52:51.380 --> 52:52.860
That's a great idea, put it in there.

52:52.860 --> 52:53.700
Anything for our-

52:53.700 --> 52:54.740
This is the long term.

52:54.740 --> 52:55.580
Yeah.

52:57.380 --> 53:00.460
So the caramel cookie crunch bar doughnut

53:00.460 --> 53:02.060
filled with a Twix cookie bar.

53:02.060 --> 53:05.100
Fucking, that's a sentence that I-

53:05.100 --> 53:06.740
No, it's just the name of a doughnut.

53:06.740 --> 53:07.980
This is how I will order it.

53:07.980 --> 53:09.580
Hello, Jeremy.

53:09.580 --> 53:12.380
I'll have the caramel cookie crunch bar doughnut

53:12.380 --> 53:14.900
filled with the Twix cookie bar.

53:14.900 --> 53:16.380
A bar-shaped doughnut.

53:17.460 --> 53:19.740
I should fucking hope so.

53:19.740 --> 53:21.180
That would be wild, yes.

53:21.180 --> 53:24.540
If it was a ring doughnut with a fucking Twix

53:24.540 --> 53:27.900
shoved through it, you'd be sent to prison.

53:27.900 --> 53:30.660
The Twix shaper is here.

53:30.660 --> 53:34.740
This is our first non-Euclidean offering.

53:36.580 --> 53:39.780
So it's what it sounds, it does what it says on the tin.

53:39.780 --> 53:44.260
A bar-shaped doughnut filled with chocolate cream

53:44.260 --> 53:48.700
and a full-sized Twix bar dipped in chocolate icing

53:48.700 --> 53:53.580
drizzled with dotre de leche and chocolate icing

53:53.580 --> 53:57.460
and topped with, you guessed it, even more Twix pieces.

53:57.460 --> 54:00.740
I wouldn't have guessed that in my darkest fantasies.

54:00.740 --> 54:03.900
Then there's the caramel cookie crunch original

54:03.900 --> 54:07.220
filled doughnut topped with Twix cookie bar pieces.

54:07.220 --> 54:10.140
A chocolate iced doughnut with salted caramel filling

54:10.140 --> 54:15.140
topped with Twix bar pieces and drizzled with dotre de leche.

54:15.220 --> 54:16.460
This all sounds like too much.

54:16.460 --> 54:17.300
I love Twix.

54:17.300 --> 54:18.820
Sounds like a little bit too much.

54:18.820 --> 54:21.260
This all seems like too much.

54:21.260 --> 54:23.380
We are, oh, this is Dave Skinner.

54:23.380 --> 54:26.540
You've guessed this already, but we are always looking

54:26.540 --> 54:28.740
for new ways to provide our fans

54:28.740 --> 54:32.620
an awesome doughnut experience.

54:32.620 --> 54:34.460
And until that comes along,

54:34.460 --> 54:37.980
we want to enter a settling for cookies in doughnuts.

54:37.980 --> 54:41.060
We're just gonna start shoving stuff in, seeing what works.

54:41.060 --> 54:42.060
Set us free.

54:42.060 --> 54:44.020
Tell us it's good enough, please, Dad.

54:44.020 --> 54:45.340
I mean, oops, what?

54:47.340 --> 54:49.780
We've partnered with another iconic brand, Twix,

54:49.780 --> 54:50.940
for the first time ever.

54:50.940 --> 54:52.140
They don't know it yet.

54:54.180 --> 54:56.660
We just think that we bought all of the Twix.

54:56.660 --> 55:00.460
That's why we've had to hide them in size so cleverly.

55:00.460 --> 55:04.940
We created mini and fun-sized doughnuts made

55:04.940 --> 55:07.780
with Twix bars and then went even further

55:07.780 --> 55:10.180
to create a bar-shaped doughnut

55:10.180 --> 55:12.260
with a full-sized Twix bar in the middle.

55:12.260 --> 55:14.420
Some said we should stop while we were ahead,

55:14.420 --> 55:15.860
but we didn't listen to them.

55:15.860 --> 55:17.580
We were so worried about if we could,

55:17.580 --> 55:19.220
we didn't stop to think about if we should,

55:19.220 --> 55:21.420
and now we're selling it.

55:21.420 --> 55:23.820
Please buy these doughnuts.

55:23.820 --> 55:26.660
You can tweet about them with a hashtag if you wish.

55:26.660 --> 55:27.580
Don't.

55:27.580 --> 55:29.580
This is an option that is available to you.

55:29.580 --> 55:30.540
Don't.

55:30.540 --> 55:32.700
They're available for a limited time,

55:32.700 --> 55:34.260
so get there quickly.

55:35.580 --> 55:37.540
I think these people are just compensating

55:37.540 --> 55:39.620
for the fact that they are not Jolly Pirates.

55:39.620 --> 55:41.460
No, yeah, no baby beats the old man.

55:41.460 --> 55:42.300
Listen.

55:42.300 --> 55:43.300
No baby beats the old man,

55:43.300 --> 55:45.340
no Twix cookie beats the old man, neither.

55:45.340 --> 55:47.740
Now, if you end up tweeting about this,

55:47.740 --> 55:49.620
which I'm not encouraging you to,

55:50.940 --> 55:54.940
encourage them to do Zagnut next.

55:54.940 --> 55:55.780
It's huge.

55:55.780 --> 55:58.380
Say like, oh, this is great, do Zagnut next.

55:58.380 --> 56:01.860
Or like a zero bar, put a zero bar in there.

56:01.860 --> 56:05.940
That was an all-timer count, thank you.

56:05.940 --> 56:07.660
Yes, well, it's a pleasure.

56:07.660 --> 56:10.220
You sound really tired, Count, are you okay?

56:10.220 --> 56:12.380
I just haven't drank enough blood.

56:12.380 --> 56:16.180
Oh, wait, you actually kill people?

56:16.180 --> 56:18.660
Yeah, I kill them to eat them.

56:18.660 --> 56:19.860
Are they all bad people?

56:21.260 --> 56:22.420
Aren't we all, though?

56:22.420 --> 56:24.900
Oh, man, that's a good question.

56:24.900 --> 56:29.900
One of my favorite Bazooka Joe comics once read,

56:30.900 --> 56:33.820
all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

56:33.820 --> 56:35.980
That was on a Bazooka Joe, huh?

56:35.980 --> 56:38.140
Yes, it's one of my favorite,

56:38.140 --> 56:40.940
I, or it may be your Christian Bible,

56:40.940 --> 56:42.220
I hold them in the same esteem.

56:42.220 --> 56:43.060
Oh, wow.

56:43.060 --> 56:43.900
Either way.

56:43.900 --> 56:45.340
Big things are being said on this episode

56:45.340 --> 56:46.180
that we can't take back.

56:46.180 --> 56:48.620
Hey, Count Dona, I had a thought the other day,

56:48.620 --> 56:49.820
I want to run by you.

56:49.820 --> 56:51.100
This is not the segment.

56:51.100 --> 56:51.940
If I get an-

56:51.940 --> 56:54.020
I only talk about donuts here, and then I leave.

56:54.020 --> 56:58.260
If I get an IV where the water has been blessed by a priest

56:58.260 --> 57:01.140
and then you drink my blood, will it hurt you?

57:02.780 --> 57:03.620
Like, if I got a holy water IV-

57:03.620 --> 57:06.100
It's a simple question, Count Dona.

57:06.100 --> 57:07.980
What don't you understand?

57:07.980 --> 57:11.540
If I got a holy water IV and then you drink my blood,

57:11.540 --> 57:12.420
will it hurt you?

57:13.620 --> 57:14.700
Uh, no.

57:14.700 --> 57:15.540
Oh.

57:15.540 --> 57:20.140
You're, because it would be mixed with your blood,

57:20.140 --> 57:22.820
which has been contaminated by original sin.

57:22.820 --> 57:27.380
It's really, it's the cumin of blood.

57:27.380 --> 57:30.900
The most delicious is the original sin.

57:30.900 --> 57:32.820
That's what we go, wow.

57:32.820 --> 57:35.860
Sorry, Count Dona, I actually have extra crispy sin.

57:35.860 --> 57:39.540
So, yeah, that's the good stuff right there.

57:39.540 --> 57:42.540
It does, oh, it's a lot of work to pump through there,

57:42.540 --> 57:44.460
but it's all the sweeter.

57:44.460 --> 57:46.820
You got, you opted for chunky stuff.

57:46.820 --> 57:49.820
Yeah, I can feel it moving all the time and hear it.

57:49.820 --> 57:50.660
Love that.

57:50.660 --> 57:51.500
Yeah, it's a real problem.

57:51.500 --> 57:52.540
I can hear it through drums.

57:52.540 --> 57:53.380
Oh, yeah?

57:54.620 --> 57:56.700
Hey, Count Dona, you're not gonna hurt me, right?

57:56.700 --> 57:57.540
Yeah, Count Dona,

57:57.540 --> 57:59.620
this has been your most upsetting appearance today.

57:59.620 --> 58:00.780
Sleep well.

58:00.780 --> 58:01.620
Oh, boy.

58:03.700 --> 58:04.820
Oh, hey, guys, here's the problem.

58:04.820 --> 58:06.260
And Justin, I'm sorry you have to hear this.

58:06.260 --> 58:07.700
I don't think we can kill Count Dona

58:07.700 --> 58:08.940
without killing Justin.

58:08.940 --> 58:10.500
Yeah, but-

58:10.500 --> 58:12.060
Who's Count, sorry, who's Count Dona?

58:12.060 --> 58:12.900
Oh, you know who he is.

58:12.900 --> 58:13.860
Now, Justin, you know.

58:13.860 --> 58:17.100
You know he's the donut obsessed,

58:17.100 --> 58:19.780
but actual vampire that drinks blood,

58:19.780 --> 58:23.580
the vampire that takes over your body to do munch squads

58:23.580 --> 58:25.860
relating specifically to donuts.

58:25.860 --> 58:26.700
And people love him.

58:26.700 --> 58:28.220
They think he's super funny.

58:28.220 --> 58:30.100
Yeah, but he was just,

58:30.100 --> 58:33.260
I'm not gonna say overtly threatening, but-

58:33.260 --> 58:34.900
But a little bit.

58:34.900 --> 58:37.460
Inefficently, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:37.460 --> 58:40.740
And I'm not saying we have to slay him,

58:40.740 --> 58:44.220
but it's there if we need it.

58:44.220 --> 58:46.060
Do we have time for another question?

58:46.060 --> 58:47.140
Yeah.

58:47.140 --> 58:49.980
There's a question I wanna include here

58:49.980 --> 58:51.900
because we got two questions this week.

58:51.900 --> 58:53.300
And I think this will be simple,

58:53.300 --> 58:55.180
but I think this is an important PSA here.

58:55.180 --> 58:56.540
So I'm gonna read them.

58:56.540 --> 58:58.580
I'm gonna tell you why I included them.

58:58.580 --> 59:00.700
Recently, I used a shuttle service

59:00.700 --> 59:02.620
from airport parking to the main terminal.

59:02.620 --> 59:04.860
The only people on the shuttle were me and the driver.

59:04.860 --> 59:05.940
When I boarded, she asked me

59:05.940 --> 59:08.620
if I was flying Spirit Airlines, and I said, no.

59:08.620 --> 59:11.940
She responded with, oh, you look like you fly Spirit.

59:11.940 --> 59:13.820
I've used Spirit once or twice when traveling,

59:13.820 --> 59:16.420
but brothers, this is the wildest comment I've ever heard.

59:16.420 --> 59:17.620
What could this possibly mean?

59:17.620 --> 59:19.220
And that's from Vax in Virginia.

59:19.220 --> 59:20.540
And then this question.

59:20.540 --> 59:22.460
I recently moved into an apartment building

59:22.460 --> 59:24.260
where a lot of elderly folks live.

59:24.260 --> 59:26.140
Recently, I was getting on the elevator

59:26.140 --> 59:29.660
just as an older couple was exiting,

59:29.660 --> 59:31.860
and they said to me, we warmed it up for you.

59:31.860 --> 59:32.740
What does that mean?

59:32.740 --> 59:34.100
And what am I supposed to say to that?

59:34.100 --> 59:36.580
I laughed awkwardly and said, thanks, and got on.

59:36.580 --> 59:37.780
That's from Baffledon, BC.

59:37.780 --> 59:39.980
In which way are these two related?

59:39.980 --> 59:41.020
I'm gonna tell you, Griffin.

59:41.020 --> 59:41.900
Okay.

59:41.900 --> 59:44.300
I know that it has been two years

59:44.300 --> 59:46.900
with very little human contact.

59:46.900 --> 59:50.020
Sometimes people just say things.

59:50.020 --> 59:51.420
People just say shit, yeah.

59:51.420 --> 59:52.820
And they don't mean anything.

59:52.820 --> 59:57.780
Sometimes there's just, they see a void in the air,

59:57.780 --> 59:59.500
and they want to fill it with something.

59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.260
This is like when you buy a movie theater ticket, right?

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:05.620
And they say, enjoy the movie, and you say, you too.

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.100
That person that sold you the tickets,

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.100
they're like, what do they mean by that?

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.300
What do they know that I don't know?

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.060
They're like, huh, they just said something.

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.020
Sometimes people just say things.

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:17.460
And I go through these questions every week, folks.

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.500
And 90% of them are like, listen,

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.500
that person just opened their mouth,

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.380
and some just dumb shit came out.

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.100
They weren't thinking about it,

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.100
but now it's in your head for weeks.

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:29.860
You have to process it.

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:32.060
Sometimes people just, when their older couple said,

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.660
we warmed it up for you, they didn't mean shit by that.

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:35.500
No.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.540
Well, unless.

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:38.380
Unless.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.140
It farted a bunch?

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.460
Ripping real dozers.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:44.300
Thank you, Travis.

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:45.140
Thank you.

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.660
Hey, thanks, Travis.

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.780
You paused a long time, Griffin.

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.980
I know, because it was gonna be so fucking funny

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:51.820
when I said-

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:52.660
Oh, wait, can you say it again?

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:54.540
No, you're interrupting me now while I'm explaining it.

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:55.980
So just listen to me.

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:56.820
Okay, what were you gonna say?

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.620
It was gonna be really funny if I waited a long time,

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.740
and then I was like, we're ripping big dozers.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.340
Like, that's what I do on this show.

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:05.060
It's like, I go quiet for a little while.

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:05.900
It's like a tactical thing.

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.180
And the longer I go quiet, people are like,

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:10.300
what twisted shit is this fucking sicko about to say?

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.180
And then, but I can't now,

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.380
when you're talking and saying like,

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:17.060
he's about to say some stuff about farts.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.020
Well, no, go ahead and say it.

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:18.860
No, it's too late.

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:21.580
You really took the wind out of my sails.

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.140
Literally.

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:24.580
No, not literally.

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.820
Not literally, he doesn't have a sail.

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:27.980
No, because it's farts are the wind.

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:30.420
I love that Travis had to say,

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.700
sometimes people just say words.

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.540
Yeah.

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:34.380
Like, that's like-

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.500
If there's one lesson you're gonna take away from me,

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.340
is that sometimes people just are awkward in silence

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.860
and have to say fucking something,

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:42.580
because there's too long of a pause and a break,

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:44.060
and they're like, oh no, oh no, oh no,

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.020
I gotta say something.

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:46.780
We warmed it up for you.

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.620
Thank God.

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.460
Oh, I almost had to think about my own thoughts

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:50.300
for a second.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.020
Anyway, I hope that helps.

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.500
Some people just say things sometimes.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.420
Sometimes we want to say shit.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:58.900
There's nothing we can do about that.

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:01.300
And you can just let it go.

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.340
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:06.300
We hope you have enjoyed yourself,

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.860
been edified, educated, entertained, all the three.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.700
All the-

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:11.540
The big ones.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.460
The ones that we aim for.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:15.660
What else is going on, Trav?

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:16.980
You're usually so promotional.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.660
Well, I want to tell you,

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:22.660
this is more just because our friend,

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:27.140
John Hangeman, Dicktown season two,

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:32.460
it returns to FXX and Hulu on March 3rd, 2022.

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:36.020
So that was, let me see, last, what, Friday?

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:37.300
Anyways, go check it out.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:38.660
I don't know what day it is.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.860
No, March, last Thursday.

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:40.700
Ah, okay.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:41.540
Today is the third.

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:43.220
John Hangeman plays John Hunchman,

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:47.740
a former famous boy detective in Dicktown.

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.620
David Reese is David Purfoy,

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:53.660
the former high school bully who now works as his driver.

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:56.940
It's part Scooby-Doo, part Bojack Horseman.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.660
Go check it out.

01:02:58.660 --> 01:02:59.820
Why are you saying it's so weird?

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:00.660
Can you try again?

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:01.500
Yeah.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:05.180
Season one was called the year's funniest animated comedy.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:09.060
And it's available on Hulu at bit.ly slash Dicktown.

01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:12.820
It's only 111 minutes long, the whole season,

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:15.260
which is just one third of an Avenger movie,

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.140
just so you know.

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:19.220
Season two finds Hunchman and Purfoy

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:22.380
finally on the verge of fame, local TV style,

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.500
and maybe even a steady bank account.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.820
Episodes premiere at 10 p.m. on FXX

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:29.460
every Thursday in March,

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.820
and then they'll be streaming the following Friday on Hulu.

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:33.660
So go check that out.

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:36.300
20 Rendezvous, Fancy Takes Flight Tour.

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:39.380
Tickets are on sale now.

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.500
Real quick update on that.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:45.180
We have had to reschedule the DC, Detroit,

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:47.460
and Cincinnati shows because of a conflict.

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.500
I promise you all the tickets sold for that

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.620
will be honored exactly the same ticket.

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:52.940
We're gonna do it.

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.300
Just further down the line,

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:56.220

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:08.780
It's wild out there.

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.620
A lot of people try and get ahold of venues

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:11.860
and et cetera, et cetera.

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:16.220
But we got stops coming up in St. Louis, Kansas City,

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:19.660

Did you forget?

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.940
Like a different one?

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:55.820
Travis, am I wrong?

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:57.340
No, I believe that this has been the case

01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:58.620
or it's been different.

01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:01.060

And you guys can just say-

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:12.300

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:13.140
Give me anyone.
