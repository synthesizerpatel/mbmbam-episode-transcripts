00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.120 --> 00:44.240
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

00:44.240 --> 00:48.640
Hello and welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era. I'm your

00:48.640 --> 00:54.240
oldest brother, George Lopez. I'm your middle-est brother, Phil Lamarr. I'm your baby brother.

00:54.240 --> 01:01.280
And unfortunately, I am Ernie Hudson. Hey, do you guys wanna hear about my Pokemon card strategy?

01:01.280 --> 01:06.400
Do you wanna rap about it? It's based mostly on powerful evolutions and power stacking.

01:07.760 --> 01:13.120
As you can certainly tell, we have been swept up in Beverly Hills, Chihuahua,

01:13.120 --> 01:27.440
three, viva la fiesta. BH3. Biba, biba la fiesta. Let me tell you, because I do speak about six

01:27.440 --> 01:35.280
years of educational Spanish, that means live the party, which is now my new life's motto.

01:35.280 --> 01:45.600
Live the party. Now, this film is directed by Lev Spiro, who I'm looking at is IMDB.

01:45.600 --> 01:52.160
You know him from other films. He is directed like Modern Family. Oh, but I like that TV show.

01:52.160 --> 01:58.160
The kids are, they're sagacious. They talk like, kids don't talk. Let me hit you with this.

01:58.160 --> 02:04.640
Wizards of Waverly plays the movie. You might also know him from Super Ninjas.

02:04.640 --> 02:11.600
That's S-U-P-A-H Ninjas, Super Ninjas. That is also another-

02:11.600 --> 02:16.560
Now, I'm sitting here, I'm looking at the IMDB page, and under the trivia, the did you know,

02:17.280 --> 02:20.960
the only thing listed is that there's a connection to Beverly Hills Chihuahua 1.

02:21.760 --> 02:27.200
I should fucking hope. Yeah, I don't know. They tried to reboot the whole franchise.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.280
Yeah, it's like a separate but parallel Chihuahua verse.

02:31.280 --> 02:36.800
You know what connection there isn't though, and that is French Stewart. I think that French Stewart

02:36.800 --> 02:42.720
listened to the episode of the podcast where we inexplicably savaged him, and then he just popped

02:42.720 --> 02:47.520
on Man in the Mirror, and then he said, no more. This far, no further.

02:47.520 --> 02:51.680
Griffin, I like that you're living in such a utopian society in which you believe that that

02:51.680 --> 02:58.480
is what happened, because my fear, my worry, is that what happened was all the executive

02:58.480 --> 03:03.200
producers of Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3 got together, and somebody said, oh, what about

03:03.200 --> 03:07.120
French Stewart? And they all kind of like, no one would make eye contact with each other,

03:07.120 --> 03:10.480
and they're just like, we don't want him back. That's even worse.

03:10.480 --> 03:15.280
Aw, can we do one episode without beating up on French?

03:15.280 --> 03:20.560
No, I think that French, I think he's reinventing himself, or alternatively,

03:20.560 --> 03:24.240
they said, let's put him in three, and then some producers are like, no, no, no.

03:24.240 --> 03:32.240
You got to have a long lead ideas when you're dreaming up the BH franchise, and just imagine-

03:32.240 --> 03:35.040
You want to leave some room to go narratively.

03:35.040 --> 03:40.640
BH3, it's going to be strong enough to stand on its own legs sans French Stewart. We got

03:40.640 --> 03:47.840
Ernie Hudson's in the mix. We have Emily Osment. We have, oh, we have Kyle Gass. That's no good,

03:47.840 --> 03:49.760
but it's going to be-

03:49.760 --> 03:52.800
That's blowing me out. Tom Cain's going to be in the mix.

03:52.800 --> 03:58.640
That's blowing me out. Tom Kenny is there by law, as dictated by law. There is voiceovers to be done.

03:58.640 --> 04:05.840
That's actually in all of it. Every single movie with voiceovers is in the contract. Tom Kenny,

04:05.840 --> 04:09.520
he can just sit by and drink coffee and watch other people do voiceovers,

04:09.520 --> 04:10.480
but he has to be there.

04:11.280 --> 04:15.200
I'm saying it's strong enough. Don't push the river. Don't shoot the cannon indoors.

04:15.200 --> 04:19.120
Let's say French Stewart for the quattro, you know?

04:19.120 --> 04:21.120
He's got to come back, so it's like a big turn.

04:21.120 --> 04:25.280
Yeah, you thought he was dead at the end of two when he fell in front of that steamroller,

04:25.280 --> 04:27.760
but no, he is back in the quattro.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.600
He's back as flat puppy.

04:29.600 --> 04:34.800
This time, this time, the Chihuahuas are going to France, and it's going to be fun because that's

04:34.800 --> 04:37.920
like, it's part of his name. We'll see you in the quattro, French.

04:38.720 --> 04:42.560
Don't you think French Stewart would be good, speaking of being run over by a steamroller,

04:42.560 --> 04:48.880
don't you think French Stewart would be good if they remade Who Framed Roger Rabbit as the bad

04:48.880 --> 04:51.680
guy, Dr. Sludge or whatever? Yes, of course he would.

04:51.680 --> 04:59.840
I mean, then we got to replace Bob. What's the detective? Bob Fudgeons is an actor.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.040
Yes, Bob Fudgeons.

05:02.320 --> 05:06.000
Bob Fudgeons is Ernie Valiant. He's got to be replaced by...

05:07.440 --> 05:08.240
Wasn't it Bob Hoskins?

05:08.240 --> 05:09.600
Also French Stewart.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.680
Sorry, Griffin, what is the name? Bob Hoskins.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.520
Bob Hoskins, not Bob Fudgeons.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.560
No. I am sorry about that.

05:14.560 --> 05:15.440
You were close.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.440
Bob Fudgeons is evil Bob Hoskins.

05:17.440 --> 05:24.080
Right. So we get French Stewart as Dr. Bad or Dr. Mean, I forget.

05:24.080 --> 05:27.200
And then as the rabbit, that's going to be CG.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.360
I think Tom Kenny will legally have to do his voice.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.320
It'll be that guy who did Gollum. What's his face? What's his name?

05:34.880 --> 05:41.760
Yeah, they're going to mocap Andy Serkis to play Roger Rabbit.

05:41.760 --> 05:45.680
Now, that's a funny connection because Peter Jackson is doing the quattro.

05:45.680 --> 05:50.240
So I'm afraid French Stewart, when we catch French in the quattro,

05:50.240 --> 05:55.040
he is going to be in the mix for like 10 years that he cannot be shooting anything else.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.200
They are really tying him up with the quattro.

05:59.280 --> 06:02.560
But hopefully he'll be able to make time for the shooting schedule

06:02.560 --> 06:04.320
of Who Framed Roger Rabbit Again.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.800
Is that the name of the movie? Who Framed Roger Rabbit Again? Layoff?

06:09.920 --> 06:12.000
Who's Still Framing Roger Rabbit?

06:12.000 --> 06:16.160
Featuring the voices of John Travolta and Roseanne Barr as the babies.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.680
All right. Time to get to the advice.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.560
I'm currently getting ready to ask my girlfriend of four years to marry me,

06:24.560 --> 06:26.720
but a bit of an issue has come up.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.320
While talking to her recently, she mentioned that her parents were a bit concerned

06:30.320 --> 06:34.000
that I had not yet talked to them concerning my proposal.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.440
She threw me for a loop.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.880
Is talking to her parents, namely her father, who thinks I'm a screw up,

06:38.880 --> 06:43.920
necessary in this day and age, or is that tradition that went away in the fifties?

06:43.920 --> 06:45.760
That's from Confused in California.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.160
No, it's still very much a thing.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.960
Yeah, so I've only ever gotten engaged the one time,

06:50.960 --> 06:58.160
but my thought on this is whatever they think is a tradition is the tradition.

06:59.280 --> 07:05.040
Yeah, I think you should probably get a read on how traditional they are,

07:05.040 --> 07:08.400
which I think is going to help you to light your way here.

07:08.400 --> 07:14.640
I don't think that this gesture would ever be...

07:14.640 --> 07:19.840
I mean, I do understand there's inherent sexism in the gesture,

07:22.480 --> 07:27.440
but I don't think that it's necessarily going to offend anyone doing it.

07:27.440 --> 07:33.120
I mean, I think you run a much greater risk of offending people by not doing it.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.440
Oh yeah, like Teresa's parents.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.280
I was talking with Teresa before I did it,

07:37.280 --> 07:38.720
and I was like, I want to talk to your parents first.

07:38.720 --> 07:39.760
And she was like, they don't care.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.480
Don't worry about it.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.760
And I was like, yeah, but I do.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.160
And it was still a very nice moment,

07:44.160 --> 07:47.520
even though it's not like if I had proposed without asking,

07:47.520 --> 07:49.520
they would have been super offended or anything.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.320
Can you guys tell me...

07:50.320 --> 07:52.080
It was just a nice moment for us.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.520
I want to hear your stories.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.960
I want to hear stories from Justin,

07:54.960 --> 07:57.440
and I want to hear stories from Travis about how this went.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.000
Because Justin, I know yours was kind of a panic attack.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.480
Yeah, I'm not good at anything that happens in this whole procedure.

08:06.480 --> 08:12.960
And I asked my now mother-in-law if she and my father-in-law

08:12.960 --> 08:16.240
could meet me at their house on their lunch break.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.120
Which I love.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.440
And I'm like, come on back to the house.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.720
Let's just like talk this through.

08:20.720 --> 08:23.360
Because you start out by inconveniencing them.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.920
I know, this is like full panic attack.

08:25.920 --> 08:31.040
And I ask them, I say, well, I'd like to...

08:31.040 --> 08:33.760
You know, they guessed, they knew the jig was up.

08:33.760 --> 08:34.720
And I am like...

08:34.720 --> 08:36.640
They somehow put two and two together?

08:36.640 --> 08:39.680
What if you just got them some subs, some Subway subs,

08:39.680 --> 08:40.800
and they just called and you thought,

08:40.800 --> 08:43.760
I just thought this would be a nice thing for us to do together.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.600
We had Subway Sub-Wednesdays.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.600
Would you come back to the house on your lunch break?

08:47.600 --> 08:50.320
I want to point out all the messes you need to clean up.

08:50.320 --> 08:55.280
Listen, so I'm in the middle of asking, and they say yes.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.520
And then my now father-in-law says,

08:58.400 --> 09:02.320
I would like to ask that you would consider maybe holding off

09:04.480 --> 09:07.760
on getting married until after she had finished medical school.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.160
Because I wouldn't want anything to get in the way of that.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.120
And that was three years away.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.560
So I like slapped my hand down the table.

09:14.560 --> 09:17.360
I was like, listen, back off.

09:18.080 --> 09:18.800
This part of the story.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.240
I don't remember that part.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.440
I said, back off.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.720
I think it's getting fictitious.

09:22.720 --> 09:27.920
And then your 9 foot tall father-in-law stood over you.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.720
Even if your father-in-law was not a 9 foot tall,

09:31.440 --> 09:33.680
I would say Conan-esque figure,

09:33.680 --> 09:37.120
you would still probably not have the gumption,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.720
the vim to pull that maneuver off.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.760
No, I just said like, I'll think about it.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.200
And then we just never brought it up again.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.720
And then you got married six months later.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.080
Yeah, I got married six months later.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.440
That was my play there.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.320
I worked out pretty good.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.400
You didn't send him an invitation to the wedding

09:52.400 --> 09:53.120
until the day before.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.720
Yeah, he just didn't bring it up again.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.000
So I was like, well, I guess this is cool.

09:56.000 --> 09:56.560
I guess we're cool.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.600
Now, to be fair, you really did tie Sydney down

09:59.600 --> 10:00.960
while she was in med school.

10:00.960 --> 10:01.760
Are you kidding me?

10:03.120 --> 10:04.560
You burned all her books.

10:04.560 --> 10:08.320
The crazy thing about his assertion is that

10:08.320 --> 10:11.760
I would ever do anything to get away of me making that money.

10:11.760 --> 10:12.160
I know.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.240
I gotta get paid.

10:16.320 --> 10:19.600
Travis, yours I imagine was much smoother.

10:19.600 --> 10:25.440
Well, I mean, it was in the fact that we took them out to dinner

10:25.440 --> 10:28.560
in Dayton so they didn't have to drive down to Cincinnati

10:28.560 --> 10:28.960
or anything.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.840
Can you drive down to Cincy on your lunch break?

10:32.560 --> 10:36.880
My plan originally was when Teresa gets up from the table,

10:36.880 --> 10:38.560
you know, use the bathroom or something,

10:38.560 --> 10:42.320
or she goes away to check on whatever, I'll do it.

10:42.320 --> 10:46.080
And I told Teresa that at about 10 minutes in, 15 minutes in,

10:46.080 --> 10:48.320
she's like, well, I'll be right back when we go to the bathroom.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.720
And I stood up with her and walked over and was like,

10:50.720 --> 10:52.080
I'm not gonna do it until you come back.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.760
I can't do this without you there.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.920
She was like, okay, cool.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.240
So I made her sit at the table while I asked her parents.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.800
Push your courage to the sticking point, Travis.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.160
I didn't at all.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.760
I pushed out.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.280
I was so freaked out in that moment.

11:05.280 --> 11:08.160
Travis, I would like to formally request

11:08.160 --> 11:10.560
that you start referring to me as King Nuggets.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.800
The king of having nuggets.

11:14.800 --> 11:15.920
That is the full title.

11:15.920 --> 11:16.800
The thing is-

11:16.800 --> 11:20.240
Let me hear it once and kind of try it on for size.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.680
So here's the thing, King Nuggets.

11:24.080 --> 11:27.440
Her dad is like a hardcore like Air Force guy

11:27.440 --> 11:30.480
and has been like, he's a lifer and he's a very,

11:30.480 --> 11:32.720
he likes me, he's a nice guy,

11:32.720 --> 11:34.720
but he's a very quiet, reserved guy

11:34.720 --> 11:37.920
who usually answers in monosyllabic responses.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.960
And like the idea of carrying on a conversation

11:40.960 --> 11:42.480
about how I was gonna marry his,

11:43.280 --> 11:45.760
you know, like be the first person to marry one of his daughters

11:45.760 --> 11:48.560
was like the most terrifying thing to do

11:48.560 --> 11:50.480
without Teresa being a trans- Travis, my father-in-law

11:50.480 --> 11:53.440
is nine feet tall and his hair is made of fire

11:53.440 --> 11:55.440
and he is always riding a horse.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.920
My father-in-law could rebuild a car

11:57.920 --> 12:00.160
like blindfolded in a cave

12:00.880 --> 12:03.600
and knows more about being a man than I would ever-

12:03.600 --> 12:05.680
Guys, guys, there's only one way to settle this.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.080
We need to get your fathers-in-law to fight each other.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.800
Well, my father-in-law is recuperated from knee surgery, so he's gonna-

12:12.800 --> 12:16.880
Then it might just be fair.

12:16.880 --> 12:19.440
I think my future father-in-law will do very well,

12:19.440 --> 12:21.440
like in the Hunger Games, like setting up traps

12:21.440 --> 12:23.440
and knowledge of weapons and whatnot,

12:23.440 --> 12:28.000
but hand-to-hand, I think that Justin's father-in-law would win.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.360
I think it is a, I personally think it is a nice gesture.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.040
And again, I do think you run more,

12:35.040 --> 12:38.000
especially if the dad already thinks you're kind of whack.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.760
You are not gonna do anything to assuage him of that.

12:41.760 --> 12:47.440
Like, not doing it feels pretty excuse-y from where I'm sitting.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.920
And if you have issues like it's sexist

12:49.920 --> 12:52.320
or I feel like it's outdated, then I mean,

12:52.320 --> 12:55.920
I think it's completely justified to make it an opportunity

12:55.920 --> 13:00.720
for you and your girlfriend to talk to both sets of parents,

13:00.720 --> 13:03.360
have a time with her parents, sit down with your parents

13:03.360 --> 13:07.120
and say, hey, we're planning this, this is gonna be coming up

13:07.120 --> 13:09.840
because they're both gonna be involved in the wedding,

13:09.840 --> 13:11.040
so both sets of parents.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.880
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.680
I think that you could make a legitimate case

13:15.680 --> 13:23.200
for having both people present if you felt it was a sexist gesture.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.800
I think it's nicer to do something, though,

13:26.800 --> 13:30.400
to show that you are looking for their approval.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.800
Like getting them some Subway subs on their lunch break.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.560
Just picking up some Subway subs on their lunch break.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.080
Or at the very least, like one of the cards

13:36.080 --> 13:37.680
with like 10 holes punched in it,

13:37.680 --> 13:39.760
so they can go pick out their own sub if they want to.

13:39.760 --> 13:43.120
To show you that I am a viable financial supporter

13:43.120 --> 13:46.960
of your progeny, here's seven out of eight

13:46.960 --> 13:48.480
punched on this Quiznos card.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.360
Where it goes next is completely up to you.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.960
Don't worry about us or our kids.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.360
I'm already, I'm not looking for,

13:55.360 --> 13:56.960
I think mine, when I do have this talk,

13:56.960 --> 13:58.080
it's gonna be very uncomfortable

13:58.080 --> 14:00.720
because I am going to request no visitation.

14:04.160 --> 14:04.880
I see.

14:04.880 --> 14:09.680
Just from the jump, from the get-go, legally.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.680
You know that you're not like adopting her.

14:14.800 --> 14:19.040
I just think it gets confusing for her, you know?

14:19.040 --> 14:21.040
She's gonna be like, which family am I a part of?

14:21.040 --> 14:25.600
And it's like, I just don't want her to ever question, you know?

14:25.600 --> 14:25.840
Right.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.360
And you don't want to have to rely on shaking the no-no can

14:29.920 --> 14:31.600
for the rest of your years.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.840
You need to set boundaries for the beginning, right?

14:33.840 --> 14:37.200
Now the no-no can, that is a can full of beans

14:37.200 --> 14:39.040
that shakes and she gets scared of the sound?

14:40.400 --> 14:41.920
You can also do a spray bottle

14:41.920 --> 14:43.920
if she gets up on the furniture.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.200
But this is not sexist by the way.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.120
I am seeing a raccoon.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.400
I'm romantically entangled with a raccoon.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.120
I was gonna suggest an invisible fence also would be great.

14:54.160 --> 14:54.960
She listens to this show.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.880
She's not gonna enjoy this part.

14:56.880 --> 14:57.380
Sorry.

14:58.080 --> 14:58.640
Sorry, baby.

14:59.920 --> 15:00.720
I love you so much.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.480
Let's do a yahoo.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.080
Sorry, cluck, cluck, cluck.

15:08.880 --> 15:11.760
Oh man, she's actually sitting 20 feet away.

15:11.760 --> 15:12.560
I'm so sorry.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.280
She's just gnawing on his furniture in defiance.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.440
I'm gonna eat this pillow.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.400
Let's do a yahoo answer.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.520
Oh, this one's good.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.800
This one was sent in by Lizzy Cross.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.360
Thanks, Lizzy.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.160
It's by yahoo answers user, Black Sunday Mold.

15:30.160 --> 15:33.520
Who asks, oh, his avatar is poop in a toilet.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.440
I do not want to look at that anymore.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.800
How to make 11-11 wish not come true.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.280
So last time during 11-11, I made a wish to see my sister.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.960
I'm studying overseas soon.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.520
When I wish for 11-11, I usually repeat the wish out loud

15:49.520 --> 15:50.720
until 11-11 is done.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.040
So for a minute, I kept saying I wish to see my sister soon.

15:53.040 --> 15:56.080
But out of nowhere in the middle of my wishing, I suddenly said,

15:56.080 --> 15:57.440
I wish I was Latin American.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.440
said I wish I was Latin American.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.880
OK, obviously, I don't want to be Latin American by the parameters.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.720
OK, I obviously don't want to be Latin American.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.080
I think my Chinese mix is all right with me.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.600
I'm not being racist or anything.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.520
With a Latin American wish come true.

16:15.520 --> 16:20.560
Also, after that accidentally slipped out, I still kept on saying I wish to see my sister.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.280
Please help.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.520
Would the Latin American wish come true?

16:23.520 --> 16:24.560
I wish to see my sister.

16:24.560 --> 16:25.600
I wish to see my sister.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.720
I wish I was Latin American.

16:26.720 --> 16:27.600
What the fuck?

16:27.600 --> 16:29.280
Why did what a Freudian?

16:30.080 --> 16:33.840
I think that this dude needs to open up to the fact that he does, in fact,

16:33.840 --> 16:35.440
wish he was Latin American.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.800
Yeah, you know, maybe he does.

16:36.800 --> 16:42.720
There's something in you that needs to just let that that carefree spirit out, you know?

16:42.720 --> 16:45.040
Yeah, feel the rhythm of the night.

16:45.040 --> 16:46.480
Feel the rhythm in your bones.

16:46.480 --> 16:46.960
It's in you.

16:46.960 --> 16:53.440
Is there another like if you make a wish at 222, it never, ever, ever will ever come true.

16:54.160 --> 16:56.400
That's another one that people don't really know much about.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.920
That's a rhyming couplet, actually.

16:59.920 --> 17:04.080
I think that whichever one you wished more, I'm not sure about the technical,

17:05.040 --> 17:08.720
but I think whichever one you wished more is the one that legally has to come through.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.280
I don't think so.

17:09.280 --> 17:13.200
I think you can get a fraction of it, you know?

17:13.200 --> 17:18.960
You might get like 66.6 repeating percent, I want to see my sister.

17:18.960 --> 17:23.680
But I think when you wake up the next morning, you are going to be one third Latin American.

17:23.680 --> 17:27.440
Well, I think the thing with that is it's like a numbers game,

17:27.440 --> 17:32.640
where if you say you want to see your sister, I don't know, like 26 times,

17:32.640 --> 17:37.760
and you say you want to be Latin American once, there's a one in 27 chance.

17:37.760 --> 17:43.920
Okay, or if we go with the fractional rule, I didn't even consider the horrifying possibility

17:43.920 --> 17:48.880
that you do wake up one 27th Latin American, and then your sister shows up, and maybe she's missing

17:48.880 --> 17:56.800
a hand. Maybe she forgot who you are, or maybe.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.880
And then you have to go find Doc Brown in the DeLorean.

18:00.880 --> 18:06.240
What is one 27th Latin American look like? Does that just mean you can pull off white dress shoes?

18:06.880 --> 18:09.360
Is that the only chain?

18:10.000 --> 18:13.840
I want you guys to know that I'm sitting here dealing with the horrifying reality that I don't

18:13.840 --> 18:17.360
know a single thing to say here that isn't just incredibly racist.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.480
Yeah, that's great, Travis.

18:18.480 --> 18:21.360
Well, I've accepted it. I've learned it.

18:21.920 --> 18:26.640
Well, now you've got a nice blend because you've admitted that you're racist without

18:27.360 --> 18:31.840
just saying anything funny, which is good because it's sort of like the worst of both.

18:31.840 --> 18:36.240
I think the only problem is we're all sitting here trying to think of something funny that

18:36.240 --> 18:43.760
applies to every Latin American person, and I think that is actually the dictionary definition

18:43.760 --> 18:44.880
of what racism is.

18:44.880 --> 18:49.360
So you're saying we need to make it broader and be like, you know, he's one 27th Latin

18:49.360 --> 18:52.960
American, so he really enjoys America's next top model.

18:52.960 --> 18:57.760
Or I think we, yeah, we explore options that don't make a lick of goddamn sense at all,

18:58.480 --> 18:59.840
which is still racism.

18:59.840 --> 19:03.440
You just say literally the first goddamn thing that comes into your head.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.400
Yeah, yeah.

19:04.400 --> 19:04.880
Basically.

19:04.880 --> 19:12.560
Like they, maybe they all really like going to the opera. Everybody knows that.

19:12.560 --> 19:13.520
Everybody knows that.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.200
Everybody knows that.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.960
They're ambivalent towards pancakes.

19:20.240 --> 19:26.640
Don't bring that. Don't bring that pancake passer around here. I offer him pancakes,

19:26.640 --> 19:32.720
he passes them right back to me. He says, I don't know. Pancakes. I don't know right now

19:32.720 --> 19:33.920
about pancakes.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.120
A closer?

19:35.120 --> 19:38.880
A closer? I'm a Latin American Canadian, eh?

19:38.880 --> 19:44.480
They, they, they took all the jobs from Australia though.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.880
Okay. Yeah, right.

19:46.880 --> 19:50.960
And gave them to Great Britain and then just kept passing them around.

19:51.760 --> 19:56.480
What if they are taking our jobs, but then they're giving, they're like the Robin Hood

19:56.480 --> 19:57.520
of jobs.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.920
They're hiding them in places we'll never find them.

20:01.520 --> 20:07.840
You know, I heard Latin Americans buried like 10,000 jobs in a landfill in New Mexico somewhere

20:07.840 --> 20:08.960
and you have to go find them.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.120
And if you're the guy who finds them, then you get them all.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.600
It's going to really take a chunk out of your free time.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.600
I never see Mark anymore.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.880
Yeah, he's got, he's holding down 10,000 jobs.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.160
He found them in a Latin American landfill.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.120
Every stump speech.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.560
He's really rich, but he is so tired.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.400
Every political stump speech ever.

20:26.400 --> 20:30.400
Some people are trying to work 10,000 jobs just to make a, just to make a living.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.560
They found them in a secret Latin American landfill.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.480
What are we fucking talking about anymore?

20:34.480 --> 20:40.800
The secret Latin American, that's why you, that's why Americans are working longer at

20:40.800 --> 20:45.200
hours in their jobs, statistically speaking, because they're afraid to turn their backs

20:45.200 --> 20:45.920
on them.

20:45.920 --> 20:50.320
The Latin Americans will come and sweep them away and hide them in a, like a burrow or

20:50.320 --> 20:50.560
something.

20:50.560 --> 20:51.680
They don't see my desk?

20:52.240 --> 20:52.560
Yeah.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.680
Hey, where's my desk?

20:54.400 --> 20:55.840
Well, don't look up in that tree.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.200
I didn't hide it up there.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.240
God damn it, Manny.

21:00.960 --> 21:01.680
Oh shit.

21:01.680 --> 21:06.880
Manny's the fat baby on, on, uh, uh, Chuckle Family.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.160
What's that fucking shit called?

21:08.160 --> 21:08.880
Yeah, Chuckle Family.

21:08.880 --> 21:09.600
Uh, Family Matters.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.520
I don't think, I don't think it's Family Matters.

21:15.520 --> 21:16.320
Modern Warfare?

21:24.880 --> 21:26.160
Okay, I got another question.

21:26.160 --> 21:26.400
Okay.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.320
Sorry if anything we said offended you, by the way.

21:30.320 --> 21:30.800
I did?

21:30.800 --> 21:31.760
Let's lay down that blanket.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.360
But if it did, I don't-

21:33.360 --> 21:34.480
It didn't make any sense.

21:34.480 --> 21:38.320
I, if we, my worry is that we like stumble on a real bad one.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.080
We fucking love pancakes.

21:40.080 --> 21:40.320
Yeah.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.200
How'd they know about that?

21:43.440 --> 21:44.800
I hate these gringos.

21:44.800 --> 21:45.440
See, look.

21:46.560 --> 21:47.920
Using the terminology.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.400
I, I, I, yeah.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.360
There's going to be some judicious editing on that portion.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.240
Oh, golly.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.320
It will take hours.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.360
Hours of deliberation and Googling.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.840
And those listening at home may have just heard

22:01.840 --> 22:04.560
like 10 to 13 minutes of silence.

22:04.560 --> 22:05.840
Straight silence.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.400
I just hope you cut out Justin's whole La Cucaracha rant.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.400
That's where it got pretty bad.

22:13.280 --> 22:14.000
Oh man.

22:14.560 --> 22:14.800
So.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.480
Oh, great lost bit.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.160
Great, great classic lost bit.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.360
Launch it into space and maybe somebody will find it.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.880
Some Martian civilization.

22:26.880 --> 22:32.560
Hey, so I've started dating this guy who seems pretty cool,

22:32.560 --> 22:34.560
but I'm converting to Catholicism,

22:35.120 --> 22:38.640
which means that premarital sex has to go.

22:39.200 --> 22:42.720
I'm pretty sure he wouldn't be happy about it if he knew.

22:42.720 --> 22:47.200
So how long is it going to take him to either leave me or cheat on me?

22:47.680 --> 22:50.960
Or is this something you guys are really willing to put up with?

22:50.960 --> 22:53.920
If they like you, that's from Gmail.

22:53.920 --> 22:57.840
That's from Gmail. To be fair, it says that that guy's not us guys.

22:58.400 --> 23:01.600
Okay, that guys are really willing to put up with if they like you.

23:01.600 --> 23:01.840
Yeah.

23:03.920 --> 23:04.480
I don't think.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.760
I don't think you can lay down that blanket statement

23:07.760 --> 23:13.440
because there's got to be guys who who who honor the the true love weights.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.080
Of course there are.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.280
Yeah, yeah, certain.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.040
Yeah, but.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.160
I don't know your dude.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.760
You didn't give us any deets on your dude.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.200
Yeah, without any sort of deets on your dude,

23:27.760 --> 23:29.920
it's going to be hard for us to to delineate.

23:29.920 --> 23:33.760
I think the important thing here is going to be honesty

23:33.760 --> 23:37.040
and forthrightness that you, you know, lay it out for him.

23:39.360 --> 23:44.000
You know, the the as honestly and directly as you can.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.040
I would caution you, however, and point out that.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.120
Just because you're converting to Catholicism,

23:51.120 --> 23:53.600
people fuck up on their religions like all the time.

23:54.320 --> 23:58.320
You know, like that's kind of the whole bit is like messing up.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.880
And then messing up and coming back.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.320
But we don't have to come back.

24:02.320 --> 24:06.800
We shouldn't tell anybody to do something less than the best of their ability.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.440
No, I'm not trying to give you permission.

24:09.440 --> 24:12.000
You should be the best Catholic you can be.

24:12.000 --> 24:12.720
Don't get me wrong.

24:12.720 --> 24:16.160
It will feel so dirty and good because now it's forbidden.

24:16.960 --> 24:17.760
Yeah, forbidden for.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.480
So it is going to feel it's going to feel better.

24:20.480 --> 24:21.840
It's going to feel wetter.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.960
It's let's.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.880
But listen, just listen.

24:27.760 --> 24:28.400
Mouth stuff.

24:31.440 --> 24:34.080
You can go right now to extremistraights.com.

24:34.080 --> 24:36.880
Coupon code Middle East and you will find things there

24:36.880 --> 24:40.480
that I'm pretty sure do not qualify as intercourse,

24:41.040 --> 24:42.880
but are going to take you on a journey.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.160
They have special attachment.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.640
Extremistraights.com Pope approved.

24:46.640 --> 24:50.000
Yeah, most of them are post sexual, I would say.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.960
Like there they go beyond our traditional ideas of intercourse.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.840
I got to say, there's a whole section in there about knee pits,

24:55.840 --> 25:00.000
about the back of your knee and like things you can do with it that I had.

25:00.000 --> 25:00.720
Absolutely.

25:00.720 --> 25:04.240
It is a secret cave of pleasure that and you got two of them.

25:04.960 --> 25:10.000
Yeah, so I don't think you should set out to to to fail.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.720
I'm I'm basically kidding about that.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.320
I do think you should be honest with the guy.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.720
And I don't think and again, this is just.

25:16.720 --> 25:21.840
I don't think anybody would say, well, that's not going to work for me.

25:21.840 --> 25:24.720
I mean, you're cool at all, but I to amend the statement.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.880
I think it should be true.

25:26.880 --> 25:28.800
Love will wait if that's what you want.

25:29.520 --> 25:30.800
He's not going to say flat out.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.120
Nope, he's going to say no.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.000
Okay, that's fine.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.480
And then y'all are going to be making out later that same afternoon.

25:38.480 --> 25:41.520
And it's going to be like, hey, I'm just going to stick it in.

25:41.520 --> 25:45.280
And then you're going to be like, no, I fucking I said no.

25:45.280 --> 25:47.520
I fucking I said it, Jerry.

25:47.520 --> 25:48.080
I said no.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.040
Well, nobody is dating anyone named Jerry.

25:51.040 --> 25:52.400
But oh, that's fair.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.320
That's how it can play out.

25:54.320 --> 25:58.160
They're going to when the lust wave, when you're swimming in the ocean of lust.

25:59.680 --> 26:04.160
And remember, you just heightened this because you just said no, no, no.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.880
This can't happen because of Jeezy.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.120
Then you Jeezy.

26:09.120 --> 26:09.920
He is going to.

26:09.920 --> 26:19.600
Combust, so you got to be vigilant when you do when you do this stuff.

26:19.600 --> 26:24.240
I was just kidding about mouth stuff, by the way, that, you know, it's up to you.

26:24.240 --> 26:27.840
You I think if it's something you're serious about and like this is important to you,

26:28.400 --> 26:35.680
then if he doesn't respect that, if he's like, no, then maybe he's not that great of a dude.

26:35.680 --> 26:44.560
Mm hmm. I had a I had a youth pastor once in when I was in in my youth appropriately enough.

26:44.560 --> 26:48.320
And he said, people, you know, you kids ask me all the time, you know, what's

26:49.200 --> 26:51.120
how far is too far?

26:51.120 --> 26:52.000
You know what?

26:52.000 --> 26:52.400
What?

26:52.400 --> 26:54.480
You know, what can I still do?

26:54.480 --> 26:58.720
And I tell him your heavenly father is watching all the time.

26:58.720 --> 27:03.280
So if you wouldn't do it with Jesus in the room, don't do it.

27:03.280 --> 27:07.920
And I sat there thinking that's a pretty fucking short list, man.

27:07.920 --> 27:12.160
Yeah, the list of things I would do if Jesus was in the room.

27:12.160 --> 27:15.760
I wouldn't chew with my mouth open if Jesus was in the room.

27:15.760 --> 27:16.720
Yeah, I do not.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.320
How come Griffin died?

27:18.320 --> 27:19.440
Oh, he stopped pooping.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.200
He stopped pooping and he died from it.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.760
I wouldn't put my elbows on the table.

27:25.760 --> 27:28.000
I'm not going to talk about Frenching.

27:28.000 --> 27:28.880
Like, no way.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.680
Excuse me.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.080
Hey, is this cool?

27:32.080 --> 27:33.440
Is this cool? Hey, J-Man.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.040
I sang at the top of my lungs in my car.

27:37.040 --> 27:38.480
Am I going to hell now?

27:38.480 --> 27:39.120
Yeah.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.600
Jesus is watching and judging you the whole time.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.760
I mean, I know I was off key, but.

27:45.040 --> 27:45.680
Sorry, bro.

27:46.640 --> 27:51.680
Hey, you know, if this guy turns out to be much more of a dipshit than we gave him credit for,

27:52.640 --> 27:57.600
maybe you'll meet some nice people in your new church that would share your values.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.440
And that and that might be a better fit.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.720
I don't know. I don't know this guy.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.120
Again, we're flying kind of blind here.

28:05.120 --> 28:12.240
Well, not to get too preachy, but there is this one concept that I remember from my youth,

28:12.240 --> 28:14.320
and it was that idea of being unequally yoked.

28:14.320 --> 28:20.480
And I think that goes both ways, you know, that if that always be with people that

28:20.480 --> 28:24.000
raise you up to the standards you want to be raised up to no matter what that is,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.240
no matter what standards you're holding yourself to.

28:26.240 --> 28:26.880
You know what I mean?

28:27.520 --> 28:30.000
And that goes to the same of like people that ride in and they're like,

28:30.000 --> 28:33.120
my boyfriend's so lazy, he doesn't have a job, just sits on the couch all day.

28:33.120 --> 28:33.920
I mean, that's bad.

28:33.920 --> 28:34.400
That's bad.

28:34.400 --> 28:35.760
He's bringing you down.

28:35.760 --> 28:37.200
He's a bad influence on you.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.480
Yeah, just.

28:40.480 --> 28:43.360
But that raises the question, what is my wife doing to me?

28:43.360 --> 28:44.560
Like, I don't understand.

28:45.200 --> 28:49.040
Well, after a hard day of her like being an adult and being responsible and taking care of things,

28:49.040 --> 28:51.200
nice to just come home and kick back with you.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.920
She's back with old low-pressure.

28:53.920 --> 28:59.120
Hey, thanks.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.400
Scraps that really.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.960
Well, I mean, she comes home and she's got no one to impress, you know.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.480
She hasn't sat down all day.

29:06.480 --> 29:11.680
She wants she wants the human equivalent of of a sumo chair.

29:11.680 --> 29:15.600
Somebody who she wants to put on her sweat pants.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.200
Yeah, you're like a Papa's on.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.960
And yeah, in that respect.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.160
Now, Travis, who is it?

29:20.160 --> 29:22.000
She doesn't have to impress.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.200
Do you know?

29:23.200 --> 29:25.520
And then who is that again for you?

29:25.520 --> 29:26.400
King Nugget.

29:26.400 --> 29:26.880
Thank you.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.720
King Nuggets.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.920
Nugget is adorable.

29:31.920 --> 29:35.680
Or his honorable and most venerable nugs.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.680
Lord High Nugs of Nuggington.

29:42.560 --> 29:48.240
King Nugget sounds like who Mayor McCheese had to overthrow to instill democracy in McDonaldland.

29:48.240 --> 29:53.600
My liege, there's been an uprising.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.120
The fry kids are revolting.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.400
Upturn the vats of honey mustard.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.040
Take my child McRib and get him out of here.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.640
Whisk him to safety.

30:06.640 --> 30:08.560
Return only when there is calm.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.080
Even then momentarily.

30:12.080 --> 30:13.440
Bring me the head of Grimace.

30:13.440 --> 30:16.160
No, my Lord, we don't know where the head starts.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.120
It just kind of slopes.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.560
Having a hard time figuring this out.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.480
Just find a thick part of the gradient.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.880
Someone bring me Lord High Chester McPizza.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.480
He's been gone from our kingdom.

30:34.320 --> 30:37.760
Advisor fajita, you've served me well these many years.

30:37.760 --> 30:41.120
Now I must send you away to Togglebell safety.

30:41.120 --> 30:47.120
My liege, here comes Kid Vib the Kingslayer.

30:47.120 --> 30:50.000
He's riding wheels like a beautiful chariot.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.520
The kids club always pays their debts.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.720
Oh, Christ.

31:02.720 --> 31:05.520
Oh, the kids club does always pay their debts.

31:05.520 --> 31:11.440
It is accurate.

31:11.440 --> 31:14.400
You know, speaking of debts, we have our own to pay.

31:14.400 --> 31:19.440
Speaking of debts, we've got to go to the money store.

31:19.440 --> 31:24.880
Hey, Griff, who is this message for?

31:24.880 --> 31:27.600
This particular message is for Kira Thompson.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.720
It's from Lance and Georgia Lewis.

31:30.720 --> 31:35.760
Who wish Kira Thompson a happy belated birthday to their MLS holding, max fun bumper sticker

31:35.760 --> 31:39.840
having, sour Broughton making, all around fantastic friend.

31:39.840 --> 31:44.240
Like my bim bam, Kira helps people resolve the pressing issues in their lives as a librarian

31:44.240 --> 31:47.520
that mostly involves directing homeless people to the bathrooms and helping children log

31:47.520 --> 31:49.760
onto computers so they can enjoy porn.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.600
A noble calling, Kira.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.840
The coolest person ever.

31:53.840 --> 31:55.520
That sounds like a pretty good message.

31:55.520 --> 32:01.520
A noble calling, Kira, the coolest person ever, that sounds like a pretty cool gig.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.520
Yeah.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.520
Travis, what about our other message?

32:03.520 --> 32:06.240
Wait, what is an MLS, you guys?

32:06.240 --> 32:10.720
It's your masters in literary library sciences.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.160
Yeah, that's what I thought.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.160
Thank you.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.160
Fuck, that might be right.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.160
I think that is.

32:15.160 --> 32:16.160
Isn't that terrifying?

32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
Travis, who's the other message for?

32:17.160 --> 32:20.240
Oh, it's for Lori Yokoyama, and it's from Jonah Yokoyama.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.240
Man, those are good names.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.240
Yeah, right?

32:23.240 --> 32:24.240
And didn't I do a great job pronouncing them?

32:24.240 --> 32:25.240
You did.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.240
You did.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.240
Really good.

32:27.240 --> 32:28.240
Good job, Travis.

32:28.240 --> 32:29.240
Well, the thing is, I've met Lori and Jonah.

32:29.240 --> 32:34.480
They came to see me in Complete Works, and Lori made some of the most amazing cupcakes

32:34.480 --> 32:37.200
I've ever had in my entire life.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.600
Are they the... I had cookies once.

32:39.600 --> 32:40.600
Good.

32:40.600 --> 32:41.600
I think the people who brought cookies since...

32:41.600 --> 32:42.600
Congrats.

32:42.600 --> 32:43.600
You smell great, sweetie.

32:43.600 --> 32:44.600
Good job.

32:44.600 --> 32:45.600
Have you guys heard of cookies?

32:45.600 --> 32:46.600
Fuck, they're good.

32:46.600 --> 32:47.600
They're like flat cupcakes.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.600
They're really yummy.

32:48.600 --> 32:56.480
They're like crackers, but like sugar crackers.

32:56.480 --> 32:57.480
Mm-hmm.

32:57.480 --> 32:58.480
Mm-hmm.

32:58.480 --> 32:59.480
Anyway.

32:59.480 --> 33:05.160
So, Jonah says, happy 120, Lori, maker of literally the most awesome cupcakes Travis

33:05.160 --> 33:08.800
McElroy has ever eaten, confirmed.

33:08.800 --> 33:12.460
Happy anniversary, eight years, and I love you more all the time.

33:12.460 --> 33:14.560
Thanks for being so supremely awesome and wonderful.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.760
I'm lucky to have you in my life.

33:16.760 --> 33:20.400
And then Jonah has informed us here to make a fart sound.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.400
There.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.600
I'm not going to... There's no way.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.600
Eager to please.

33:25.600 --> 33:26.840
There is absolutely no way-

33:26.840 --> 33:27.840
Happy to be here.

33:27.840 --> 33:32.840
... that I'm ever going to... I did it with my knee pit.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.680
Those goons are better than Beverly Hills 2 all but 3.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.080
They probably quite literally are.

33:38.080 --> 33:45.160
I also want to talk to you guys who mentioned them earlier, but ExtremeRestraints.com is

33:45.160 --> 33:51.360
a site where you can buy all your adult toys for adults only.

33:51.360 --> 33:55.920
We have this coupon code, MIDDLIST, and it does two things for you.

33:55.920 --> 34:01.320
One, it saves you 20% on all your adult purchases, which is rad.

34:01.320 --> 34:08.200
But more importantly, it puts your purchase on a big list of purchases by MBMBAMFITS.

34:08.200 --> 34:09.560
An anonymous list.

34:09.560 --> 34:10.560
We should point out.

34:10.560 --> 34:11.560
An anonymous list.

34:11.560 --> 34:12.560
We have no names or anything.

34:12.560 --> 34:17.880
We have this list of things people have bought that, wow, some of you guys, you dug deep.

34:17.880 --> 34:18.880
You're getting it.

34:18.880 --> 34:21.440
You are getting it.

34:21.440 --> 34:29.040
We got a beaded silk rope, the Climax Gems vibrator, and a Scarlett Overload beaded anal

34:29.040 --> 34:30.040
plug.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.040
That's one order.

34:31.040 --> 34:32.040
I mean, that's-

34:32.040 --> 34:35.240
What do you think the Superhead honcho is?

34:35.240 --> 34:38.620
I don't know, but lots of people seem to be getting into that right now.

34:38.620 --> 34:41.760
What about Sammy's Fist anal plug?

34:41.760 --> 34:44.120
Pretty cool, pretty cool.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.680
Butterfly lace tanga panty.

34:45.680 --> 34:46.680
That sounds nice.

34:46.680 --> 34:48.000
That sounds like a nice place to start.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.740
How about latex briefs with a penis sleeve?

34:50.740 --> 34:56.360
That's good because sometimes my penis gets so cold.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.600
Just for this warm, you know, winter is coming.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.600
Winter is coming.

35:00.600 --> 35:01.600
Put your dick in this sleeve.

35:01.600 --> 35:05.760
Now, I know, I think I have a basic idea of what this thing is, but the name makes it

35:05.760 --> 35:06.760
sound real fun.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.600
The double balloon enema nozzle.

35:08.600 --> 35:09.600
Yay!

35:09.600 --> 35:10.600
Yay!

35:10.600 --> 35:11.600
Get it!

35:11.600 --> 35:13.960
The double balloon of fluid just will not do.

35:13.960 --> 35:14.960
Yep.

35:14.960 --> 35:17.280
Uh, this is very great.

35:17.280 --> 35:18.280
This is great.

35:18.280 --> 35:24.320
Trinity Contempo rabbit vibrator, and four AAA alkaline batteries.

35:24.320 --> 35:27.080
So hey, it's your one stop shop.

35:27.080 --> 35:33.080
Is this person preparing to orgasm through the apocalypse?

35:33.080 --> 35:35.120
Case of water.

35:35.120 --> 35:39.560
Somebody bought a three in one sun touched candle.

35:39.560 --> 35:43.960
Which I assume they just lit and then ran jammed right up their butthole.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.880
I don't know what you do with this.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.720
But anyway, that's ExtremeRestraints.com.

35:47.720 --> 35:48.720
It's spelled just like it sounds.

35:48.720 --> 35:53.400

35:58.920 --> 36:01.280

I think they are our leading sponsor, which literally makes me so happy every time.

That'll make them real happy.

36:24.780 --> 36:25.780
Yeah.

36:25.780 --> 36:26.780
Yeah, they'll like that.

36:26.780 --> 36:27.780
Hey.

36:27.780 --> 36:28.780
How about a Yahoo answer?

36:28.780 --> 36:29.780
I'm wanting one of those.

36:29.780 --> 36:30.780
So bad.

36:30.780 --> 36:31.780
This one was sent in by Seth Condon.

36:31.780 --> 36:32.780
Thanks, Seth.

36:32.780 --> 36:33.780
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

36:33.780 --> 36:35.120
Oh, it's just a colon.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.120
OK.

36:36.120 --> 36:37.120
Easy enough.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.280
Is it a picture of a colon?

36:39.280 --> 36:42.280
Because that sounds more like Yahoo Answers.

36:42.280 --> 36:48.680
I think that emoticon is like you've got the eyes, but the mouth is sewn shut.

36:48.680 --> 36:49.680
That's horrifying.

36:49.680 --> 36:53.620
They ask, what Pokemon should we name our baby after?

36:53.620 --> 36:55.200
Me and my husband are so excited for our new baby.

36:55.200 --> 36:59.800
We really love the first 151 Pokemon and are planning to name her him after a Pokemon.

36:59.800 --> 37:03.240
We have some preliminary names picked out, but are having a tough time deciding.

37:03.240 --> 37:06.080
What do you guys think of these names?

37:06.080 --> 37:12.040
And then they list some Pokemon names, including Psyduck, and Caterpie, and Raichu.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.040
Is Ghastly in there?

37:13.040 --> 37:14.040
Ekans.

37:14.040 --> 37:15.040
Ghastly.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.040
Ghastly.

37:16.040 --> 37:17.720
Ghastly is not among them.

37:17.720 --> 37:23.400
I appreciate these people's attempt to keep it OG by not introducing the other ones, because

37:23.400 --> 37:28.680
I feel like they really lost their shit for the naming conventions for 152 on.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.920
Yeah, so we're keeping a ridge.

37:30.920 --> 37:34.520
We're keeping Gin 1, Red, Blue, or LeafGreen, FireRed.

37:34.520 --> 37:40.720
Okay, so my vote goes to Slowbro.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.280
Is there any particular reason?

37:42.280 --> 37:45.720
Because I feel like you're setting that kid up to fucking fail.

37:45.720 --> 37:48.120
Well, I thought we were already planning on that.

37:48.120 --> 37:49.280
I thought that was already a super plan.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.280
Oh, I see.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.280
You're leading into it.

37:51.280 --> 37:55.560
Yeah, I'm just going with it.

37:55.560 --> 38:08.960
I think that my choice would have to be for Stunky.

38:08.960 --> 38:11.440
Stunky the Pokemon.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.240
Is Stunky a Pokemon?

38:13.240 --> 38:17.200
Yeah, and it looks exactly like it sounds.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.280
So actually, okay, I'm going to pick a real one.

38:19.280 --> 38:23.920
Because Justin, I do not want to put you on blast, but that is definitely not an original

38:23.920 --> 38:24.920
Pokedex.

38:24.920 --> 38:27.280
Okay, I'm sorry Griffin.

38:27.280 --> 38:33.680
How about I go with, I'll go with one from the original 151 and go with Spinarak.

38:33.680 --> 38:34.680
That'll be good.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.680
Yeah, that's good.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.680
Spinarak.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.020
Spinarak is from- Yeah, because your child's going to be an

38:39.020 --> 38:40.020
evil mage.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.200
Wait, so Griffin is Spinarak?

38:41.200 --> 38:42.760
Of course not.

38:42.760 --> 38:44.480
Sorry, why?

38:44.480 --> 38:48.200
Because it's in the second, it's in the gold silver crystal generation, Justin.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.200
You know this?

38:49.200 --> 38:50.200
Obviously you know this.

38:50.200 --> 38:51.760
What about- I feel like you're just doing this to piss

38:51.760 --> 38:52.760
me off now.

38:52.760 --> 39:00.400
Okay, I'm going to have to go with, can I use Japanese names?

39:00.400 --> 39:02.200
I think you have to.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.920
Okay, then I'm going to go with Nidoqueen.

39:04.920 --> 39:07.640
Okay, that's not a Japanese name, that's a real-

39:07.640 --> 39:09.400
Sorry Griffin, what?

39:09.400 --> 39:10.400
That's what it was called.

39:10.400 --> 39:11.400
Okay.

39:11.400 --> 39:17.080
You make me so fucking angry.

39:17.080 --> 39:19.040
All I want out of you is a straight answer.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.040
Fushigi Banner.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.040
Okay.

39:21.040 --> 39:26.840
Fushigi Banner is Venusaur in Japan.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.120
I like that way, way better.

39:28.120 --> 39:30.440
I'm going to go with Mr. Mime.

39:30.440 --> 39:34.840
Because it's good, you are saying a lot about that kid.

39:34.840 --> 39:35.840
Right from the jump.

39:35.840 --> 39:41.880
Hey, by the way, there are, I'm going to say, I didn't count them, but I'll say about 25

39:41.880 --> 39:49.680
answers to this, and all of them are composed of Pokemon names, and not please for not doing

39:49.680 --> 39:53.760
this thing, not doing this terrible, terrible thing to a human being.

39:53.760 --> 39:57.600
Not cries for mercy, please to the governor to spare this child.

39:57.600 --> 40:03.120
Here's the thing, but this is what blows my mind whenever we stumble upon the Yahoos

40:03.120 --> 40:06.480
that are like, I want to name my kid after Harry Potter people.

40:06.480 --> 40:11.080
There are real-ass regular normal names somewhere in the Pokeverse.

40:11.080 --> 40:13.600
Yeah, sure, like Charizard.

40:13.600 --> 40:19.560
No, name your kid, I'm saying name your kid fucking Ash, name him Brock, name her Misty.

40:19.560 --> 40:23.960
No, don't, why would you pick, why would you say like, no, those are real bullshit names.

40:23.960 --> 40:27.560
I'm going with Pikachu, like fuck you.

40:27.560 --> 40:31.800
Everybody wants to be the person that does the thing that no one else has done before.

40:31.800 --> 40:37.440
And I think that you have, I think if you name your kid, you know, Ponyta, I think you're

40:37.440 --> 40:42.120
probably in the clear, as far as that is concerned.

40:42.120 --> 40:47.440
Let's be honest though, I mean, our worry is that you, you know, this kid will become

40:47.440 --> 40:53.320
a social outcast because he's named after a goddamn Pokemon, but consider this kid's

40:53.320 --> 40:55.360
parents.

40:55.360 --> 40:56.360
The dais cast.

40:56.360 --> 41:00.320
I mean, I don't think that this guy's going to be the head of the lacrosse team.

41:00.320 --> 41:06.960
No, and he's going to feel, there's going to be a lot of psychological issues, you know,

41:06.960 --> 41:09.480
vis-a-vis having 150 siblings.

41:09.480 --> 41:14.440
Yeah, because they got to pop them all out, right?

41:14.440 --> 41:15.440
Got to birth them all.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.440
Got to birth them all.

41:16.440 --> 41:21.280
I got to say though, I did just picture like the idea of this child growing up to just

41:21.280 --> 41:23.280
be an incredibly successful lawyer.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.680
I think you mean evolving into an incredibly successful lawyer.

41:25.680 --> 41:30.880
Evolving into a successful lawyer and someone just be like, now Geodude Johnson, attorney

41:30.880 --> 41:35.400
of law, are there criminals out there affecting you?

41:35.400 --> 41:36.400
Don't worry.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.400
I'll catch them all.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.640
Professional football player, Charizard Jones.

41:39.640 --> 41:42.520
Oh, I got Charizard Jones on my fantasy team.

41:42.520 --> 41:43.520
Oh, that rules.

41:43.520 --> 41:44.520
That would be great.

41:44.520 --> 41:50.960
Yeah, that would actually be the best.

41:50.960 --> 41:56.320
Wiggly tough Peterson, I find you guilty of four counts of patricide.

41:56.320 --> 42:01.080
You killed your parents, resurrected them, and then killed them again.

42:01.080 --> 42:03.960
What a terrible crime, but who can blame you?

42:03.960 --> 42:04.960
You're off scot-free.

42:04.960 --> 42:09.920
Vote for me, May Champ Smith.

42:09.920 --> 42:12.680
President May Champ, what have you done?

42:12.680 --> 42:15.040
You have run our country into the ground.

42:15.040 --> 42:19.960
Are you really better off than you were four years ago when President Pidgeotto was elected?

42:19.960 --> 42:27.360
Can we have a new weekly segment on the show called Justin Tries to Pronounce Pokemon Names?

42:27.360 --> 42:29.040
I did great.

42:29.040 --> 42:31.240
I should have gone with Butterfree.

42:31.240 --> 42:32.240
That's my bad.

42:32.240 --> 42:41.080
Or, you know, I should have gone with Floppy, is that how that's pronounced?

42:41.080 --> 42:42.080
Mareep?

42:42.080 --> 42:44.040
Mareep is a pretty good name.

42:44.040 --> 42:45.640
That would be a great pick for them.

42:45.640 --> 42:48.320
Dr. B-Drill Murphy, O-B-G-Y-N.

42:48.320 --> 42:53.440
Yeah, let me get up in there, much like a drill would do on a bee's hand.

42:53.440 --> 42:56.600
Can we move on?

42:56.600 --> 42:59.000
I have a question here.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.220
Hey, brothers.

43:01.220 --> 43:05.160
I've been a tattoo artist for seven years, and one of the hardest parts of my job is

43:05.160 --> 43:10.340
gently informing potential clients that getting their girlfriend or boyfriend's name tattooed

43:10.340 --> 43:12.600
on them is a terrible idea.

43:12.600 --> 43:15.980
Can you help me come up with some good ways to let them know they're being dumb?

43:15.980 --> 43:20.640
That's from bringing the pain in Maine.

43:20.640 --> 43:23.960
I have an idea.

43:23.960 --> 43:27.120
You know when you go to a tattoo parlor, or for those of you that have never been to a

43:27.120 --> 43:32.600
tattoo parlor, they have books up front that is a catalog of the artist's work so that

43:32.600 --> 43:35.400
you can be like, oh, I really like this idea and I like this aesthetic.

43:35.400 --> 43:38.560
And there's always a section where it's cover ups.

43:38.560 --> 43:43.400
What if you had a book that was just cover ups, where someone got a boyfriend or girlfriend's

43:43.400 --> 43:46.280
name tattooed and then got it covered up by something?

43:46.280 --> 43:51.000
Yeah, have them go ahead and pick out which cover up they want.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.320
And make that part of the deal where they gotta sign a contract that says they'll come

43:54.320 --> 43:55.320
back to you.

43:55.320 --> 43:56.320
It's like a tattoo prenup.

43:56.320 --> 43:57.320
I like that.

43:57.320 --> 43:58.320
Yes.

43:58.320 --> 44:01.800
Yeah, you gotta prepay for your cover up.

44:01.800 --> 44:08.360
So you get Jennifer tattooed on you with the option of, if it doesn't work out, you get

44:08.360 --> 44:14.440
it augmented to say, whatever happened to Jennifer Grey?

44:14.440 --> 44:18.240
You get it augmented to Bennifer because you were just such a huge fan of Bennifer and

44:18.240 --> 44:19.240
Jennifer Garner.

44:19.240 --> 44:20.240
Yeah.

44:20.240 --> 44:23.520
Now how do you cover up your Bennifer tattoo when that falls apart?

44:23.520 --> 44:24.520
Because I got that.

44:24.520 --> 44:25.520
I would like to know.

44:25.520 --> 44:32.200
Well no, in that scenario you're covered because he went from Lopez to Garner.

44:32.200 --> 44:37.000
I'm saying as long as he keeps seeing Jennifer as you are, you are in the clear.

44:37.000 --> 44:43.040
I gotta say, and maybe there's this sort of different ethics that I'm not aware of in

44:43.040 --> 44:51.560
the tattooing biz, but I gotta say, man, just fucking do the tattoo.

44:51.560 --> 44:56.680
The only knowledge that you could be imparting to them is that it is permanent.

44:56.680 --> 44:59.680
And if they are not aware of that, then...

44:59.680 --> 45:03.200
You don't think that there's a certain amount of inherent responsibility?

45:03.200 --> 45:08.040
That's different from going and getting a haircut because someone said, dye my hair

45:08.040 --> 45:11.440
and shave my basketball number into my face or something.

45:11.440 --> 45:12.520
And you're like, okay, cool.

45:12.520 --> 45:14.960
And then that will grow out and that will go away.

45:14.960 --> 45:19.240
But if someone comes into you and says, I want this terrible idea for a tattoo.

45:19.240 --> 45:22.040
I don't want to live in a tattoo in any state.

45:22.040 --> 45:23.040
But it's...

45:23.040 --> 45:24.840
If I want to get a stupid tattoo, then I should be allowed to.

45:24.840 --> 45:29.440
They have to practice a regimen of stern non-malfeasance.

45:29.440 --> 45:34.060
They adhere to the Hippocratic Oath, just like every other medical professional.

45:34.060 --> 45:44.400
And that means they can't put a race car with Miley Cyrus's face on it on somebody's body

45:44.400 --> 45:48.080
as a joke, or maybe for serious.

45:48.080 --> 45:51.480
Are you saying that they can't do that instead of what the person asked for?

45:51.480 --> 45:54.960
Or can you not just say, I don't think that's a good idea?

45:54.960 --> 45:57.400
Or is that like, well, fuck you?

45:57.400 --> 46:01.720
I think they can turn people away, right?

46:01.720 --> 46:03.160
I'm sure you can turn...

46:03.160 --> 46:06.280
No one's ever gotten a tattoo at gunpoint, I think.

46:06.280 --> 46:08.360
No, but they can turn people away for being drunk.

46:08.360 --> 46:10.400
I think that this is along the same lines.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.400
You say you're drunk.

46:11.400 --> 46:12.400
You're drunk.

46:12.400 --> 46:13.400
You're drunk.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.400
You're drunk.

46:14.400 --> 46:15.400
Get out of here.

46:15.400 --> 46:16.400
I'll make you a deal.

46:16.400 --> 46:17.560
If you still want this in a year, I'll do it for you.

46:17.560 --> 46:25.160
But then they're just going to go to the rusty needles or whatever the bad tattoo parlor

46:25.160 --> 46:26.160
is.

46:26.160 --> 46:29.240
They're going to get an alleyway tattoo from a person who doesn't know what they're doing,

46:29.240 --> 46:30.960
and then they're serious.

46:30.960 --> 46:33.480
They don't give a shit about the Hippocratic Oath in the alley.

46:33.480 --> 46:35.960
You could give them a tattoo of blood.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.240
Oh, that's a good idea, Trav.

46:38.240 --> 46:39.240
I like that.

46:39.240 --> 46:40.240
Get them a tattoo of what?

46:40.240 --> 46:41.240
A blood tattoo.

46:41.240 --> 46:42.240
A tattoo of blood.

46:42.240 --> 46:48.440
They hurt a lot more because there's no ink, but you can, by doing the...

46:48.440 --> 46:53.240
You know, you can get a tattoo with no ink, and it'll just stitch your blood in there.

46:53.240 --> 46:54.440
It's not permanent.

46:54.440 --> 46:56.440
It will heal, but maybe see how that goes.

46:56.440 --> 47:00.760
So are we just talking about cutting a thing into you, and then it's a scar?

47:00.760 --> 47:01.760
Well, yeah.

47:01.760 --> 47:02.760
I mean, yes.

47:02.760 --> 47:03.760
Yes and no.

47:03.760 --> 47:08.120
So last year, when I reached into the oven to get a pizza out, and I burned my forearm

47:08.120 --> 47:16.160
on the rack, that was just me getting a bitch in blood tattoo.

47:16.160 --> 47:17.160
That was a pizza brand.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.160
Okay.

47:18.160 --> 47:19.160
You got branded by your love of pizza.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.160
Oh, shit.

47:20.160 --> 47:23.860
Guys, I just remembered I got some pizza.

47:23.860 --> 47:25.180
It's right across my wrist.

47:25.180 --> 47:28.840
It looks like I tried to shuffle myself off this mortal coil, and really what happened

47:28.840 --> 47:33.920
was that I had a tombstone in there, and I just really couldn't wait to get at it.

47:33.920 --> 47:34.920
Is tombstone pizza...

47:34.920 --> 47:35.920
You had to earn it.

47:35.920 --> 47:41.240
I had a tombstone pizza from 1997 that I've been saving.

47:41.240 --> 47:51.200
You know, every pizza has a story, but only Griffin's pizza has a legend.

47:51.200 --> 47:55.160
You understand that tombstone pizza was a pizza company.

47:55.160 --> 48:00.720
This was not a promotional pizza for the movie Tombstone.

48:00.720 --> 48:02.080
I feel like it was.

48:02.080 --> 48:06.820
All the pepperonis shaped like Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday cheese.

48:06.820 --> 48:09.040
This has gotten out of control.

48:09.040 --> 48:10.040
Yeah.

48:10.040 --> 48:14.640
Well, yeah, usually how a bitch shakes out.

48:14.640 --> 48:19.440
Hey, I recently found out two of my cousins started following me on Twitter.

48:19.440 --> 48:23.700
This wouldn't be an issue, except I'm 30 and they're 14 and 11.

48:23.700 --> 48:27.320
It's not like I'm shoveling hate and filth in my tweets, but I'm a grown ass lady woman

48:27.320 --> 48:30.040
with a grown ass lady woman thoughts and opinions.

48:30.040 --> 48:31.040
What should I do?

48:31.040 --> 48:36.040
Be uncool and block them or censor myself in hopes that I don't corrupt young minds?

48:36.040 --> 48:38.220
That's from not sure what to do in Chicago.

48:38.220 --> 48:40.480
This is great.

48:40.480 --> 48:42.520
We all had to deal with this.

48:42.520 --> 48:45.240
Yes.

48:45.240 --> 48:53.080
I feel like Twitter is the truest form of who you are.

48:53.080 --> 48:54.080
That's not true.

48:54.080 --> 48:55.080
No.

48:55.080 --> 49:03.120
I say fuck a bunch on Twitter and my fairly religious cousins listen or follow the tweets

49:03.120 --> 49:04.120
I say.

49:04.120 --> 49:07.080
I can't help but feel... You just got to stomach the disappointment every time you

49:07.080 --> 49:08.080
say anything.

49:08.080 --> 49:09.080
Yeah.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.720
You know what is funny about that, Griffin?

49:10.720 --> 49:19.400
I had that problem too, but I recently checked in and the situation had resolved itself.

49:19.400 --> 49:20.400
They stopped following you?

49:20.400 --> 49:21.400
They stopped following you.

49:21.400 --> 49:23.400
They did unfollow the kid.

49:23.400 --> 49:24.400
Yes.

49:24.400 --> 49:26.680
That is really too bad.

49:26.680 --> 49:34.440
I have been unfollowed and I can't... I don't think I can follow a 15 year old without it

49:34.440 --> 49:35.440
being mutual.

49:35.440 --> 49:41.160
I had to unfollow them reciprocally, reciprocably, reciprocably.

49:41.160 --> 49:42.160
Got it.

49:42.160 --> 49:43.160
Yeah.

49:43.160 --> 49:46.160
Got it in one.

49:46.160 --> 49:48.280
One take J they call me.

49:48.280 --> 49:55.960
I had this experience yesterday where I was at work and this 15 year old said, hey, I

49:55.960 --> 49:58.560
really liked your show.

49:58.560 --> 50:04.480
Me thinking it was one of the many plays that I have worked on, I said, oh, which one?

50:04.480 --> 50:08.160
He said, my brother, my brother and me and my response was, oh.

50:08.160 --> 50:09.160
Oh, fuck.

50:09.160 --> 50:10.160
Sorry.

50:10.160 --> 50:13.520
Sorry for saying fuck just then too.

50:13.520 --> 50:14.520
You should go.

50:14.520 --> 50:17.240
You should... Can you leave?

50:17.240 --> 50:21.360
You got to find... What you got to do is find the balance that works for you so that

50:21.360 --> 50:22.360
you can sleep at night.

50:22.360 --> 50:25.960
For instance, I stopped saying the C word on Twitter.

50:25.960 --> 50:26.960
That's good.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.640
That was a good place to start.

50:28.640 --> 50:34.440
I do have a secret special other Twitter feed where I really just let it all hang out.

50:34.440 --> 50:39.440
See, because every time Griffin censors a word, that word doesn't go away.

50:39.440 --> 50:40.440
Oh, no.

50:40.440 --> 50:41.440
Right.

50:41.440 --> 50:42.760
You got to put it somewhere or you get a backlog of words.

50:42.760 --> 50:45.560
I can't keep carving them into my body.

50:45.560 --> 50:50.200
I got to find a healthier venue for them.

50:50.200 --> 50:51.760
You mean giving yourself a tattoo of blood.

50:51.760 --> 50:52.760
Yeah, yeah.

50:52.760 --> 50:53.760
That's what you're doing.

50:53.760 --> 50:54.760
Yeah.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.740
My body is just covered in blood tattoos of the C word.

50:56.740 --> 50:58.640
We didn't make that concept up.

50:58.640 --> 50:59.640
I want to make that clear.

50:59.640 --> 51:00.640
No.

51:00.640 --> 51:03.640
It was in one of Penn and Teller's books.

51:03.640 --> 51:04.640
Yeah.

51:04.640 --> 51:05.640
I think it was the travel book.

51:05.640 --> 51:06.640
Yeah.

51:06.640 --> 51:07.640
It's a school to read song.

51:07.640 --> 51:09.120
This Yahoo answer is sent in by Nicole B. Thompson.

51:09.120 --> 51:10.120
Thanks, Nicole.

51:10.120 --> 51:15.640
It's by Yahoo answer's user, Dina, who asks, what's Fifty Shades of Grey about?

51:15.640 --> 51:19.000
A reading teacher's favorite book in my school is Fifty Shades of Grey, and I heard it's

51:19.000 --> 51:21.060
like porn, but in words.

51:21.060 --> 51:23.080
Can someone tell me what happens in the book?

51:23.080 --> 51:24.080
Yeah.

51:24.080 --> 51:26.400
I'll try to wrap it up for you.

51:26.400 --> 51:30.120
See, there's a rich businessman whose name is Christian Grey.

51:30.120 --> 51:31.120
Have you read the book?

51:31.120 --> 51:32.120
No.

51:32.120 --> 51:33.120
Okay.

51:33.120 --> 51:36.400
There's a young lady named, let's say Darlene.

51:36.400 --> 51:37.400
Okay.

51:37.400 --> 51:38.400
Okay.

51:38.400 --> 51:39.400
Christian Grey is this rich businessman.

51:39.400 --> 51:40.400
Darlene, I'm going to fuck you so good.

51:40.400 --> 51:41.400
That's not what he says.

51:41.400 --> 51:49.400
He says, Darlene, I'm going to spank you, and Darlene's like, oh, Christopher, please

51:49.400 --> 51:50.400
spank me.

51:50.400 --> 51:53.960
At first, I think she's more, I think she's like, I don't know if it's going to feel

51:53.960 --> 51:54.960
good.

51:54.960 --> 51:55.960
Yeah.

51:55.960 --> 51:56.960
At first, she's like, you're right.

51:56.960 --> 51:57.960
At first, she's like, I don't know if I like to get spanked.

51:57.960 --> 51:58.960
I don't know.

51:58.960 --> 52:01.960
I don't want my fanny to get reddened.

52:01.960 --> 52:05.240
And then Christian's like- Is she a ghost?

52:05.240 --> 52:06.240
She is a ghost.

52:06.240 --> 52:07.240
In the book, she's a ghost.

52:07.240 --> 52:12.080
So Christian Grey's like, well, I'm sorry, Darlene, but I'm going to try spanking you

52:12.080 --> 52:13.080
anyway.

52:13.080 --> 52:14.080
So Christian is melting.

52:14.080 --> 52:15.080
Mm-hmm.

52:15.080 --> 52:16.080
Yes.

52:16.080 --> 52:17.280
I'm trying to follow along here.

52:17.280 --> 52:18.280
Yeah.

52:18.280 --> 52:19.280
Keep up.

52:19.280 --> 52:20.280
Christian is melting.

52:20.280 --> 52:21.280
Darlene is a ghost.

52:21.280 --> 52:22.280
Okay.

52:22.280 --> 52:28.600
And he takes her over her knee, and he said, get ready for the spank, spank, spank.

52:28.600 --> 52:29.600
Wait.

52:29.600 --> 52:30.600
I'm confused.

52:30.600 --> 52:33.600
The spanking cushioner is coming into town.

52:33.600 --> 52:35.600
I was trying to think of something better to spank a cushioner.

52:35.600 --> 52:38.600
So Christian Grey is the pallbearer.

52:38.600 --> 52:39.600
Yes.

52:39.600 --> 52:46.600
So Christian Grey, who you may know better as Undertaker manager, pallbearer, says, oh,

52:46.600 --> 52:49.600
yeah, it's time to spank you.

52:49.600 --> 52:50.600
Uh-huh.

52:50.600 --> 52:53.600
I got a hankering for spanking.

52:53.600 --> 52:56.600
I'm going to give it to you.

52:56.600 --> 53:00.600
And he's also selling children's cereal.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.600
I'm going to give it to you.

53:02.600 --> 53:03.600
So good.

53:03.600 --> 53:05.600
And Darlene's like, I still don't know.

53:05.600 --> 53:06.600
But then, flak.

53:06.600 --> 53:07.600
Gives her the first.

53:07.600 --> 53:11.600
His hand actually passes through her, her spectral form.

53:11.600 --> 53:12.600
Yeah.

53:12.600 --> 53:13.600
And that gives him.

53:13.600 --> 53:14.600
He loves it.

53:14.600 --> 53:15.600
Gives him a button.

53:15.600 --> 53:17.600
Now, did he buy his riding crop on ExtremeMachines.com?

53:17.600 --> 53:18.600
You bet he did.

53:18.600 --> 53:20.600
Or use the coupon code MEDALIS.

53:20.600 --> 53:25.600
So he spanks her, and that's like the next 200 pages.

53:25.600 --> 53:33.600
Or is it just one spank that just reverberates through her body?

53:33.600 --> 53:38.600
And then she describes it in much detail.

53:38.600 --> 53:43.600
I felt my ectoplasm shudder through my body.

53:43.600 --> 53:46.600
It was as though he were spanking my very soul.

53:46.600 --> 53:51.600
As his melting pallbearer-esque hand slipped through my spectral form.

53:51.600 --> 53:55.600
I felt myself begin to slimer.

53:55.600 --> 53:59.600
And then I slimered and slimered and slimered.

53:59.600 --> 54:00.600
And there's 30 pages of that.

54:00.600 --> 54:03.600
I slimered and slimered over and over again.

54:03.600 --> 54:07.600
And then Ernie Hudson showed up and sent me back.

54:07.600 --> 54:11.600
And made me watch Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3 and said, watch this scene I'm in.

54:11.600 --> 54:12.600
It's real good.

54:12.600 --> 54:13.600
You're going to love this scene.

54:13.600 --> 54:14.600
Travis, you're in the second book now.

54:14.600 --> 54:15.600
You've moved on to the second.

54:15.600 --> 54:16.600
Oh, sorry.

54:16.600 --> 54:17.600
Sorry.

54:17.600 --> 54:23.600
I think that here's an opportunity for us.

54:23.600 --> 54:27.600
If we could somehow create what Fifty Shades of Grey has done to books.

54:27.600 --> 54:29.600
By which I mean ruined them forever.

54:29.600 --> 54:35.600
I think we have a great chance to really seize the podcast market share here.

54:35.600 --> 54:39.600
Yeah, if we could ruin podcasts like we haven't done that already.

54:39.600 --> 54:42.600
I don't know how we could be more erotic than we're already being.

54:42.600 --> 54:43.600
That's a good point.

54:43.600 --> 54:47.600
We could have a secret alternate podcast stream.

54:47.600 --> 54:53.600
Where we talk about just like sex stuff and like really, I guess that's this.

54:53.600 --> 54:54.600
Never mind.

54:54.600 --> 54:55.600
Thanks for listening.

54:55.600 --> 54:58.600
Yeah, I mean it's basically, this is basically the Fifty Shades of Grey.

54:58.600 --> 55:00.600
Just people don't like it as much.

55:00.600 --> 55:03.600
Maybe we need to do an alternate podcast where we don't do any of that.

55:03.600 --> 55:05.600
And it's appropriate for our cousins to listen to.

55:05.600 --> 55:10.600
And that will make this one seem more like Shades of Grey in comparison.

55:10.600 --> 55:11.600
That's good.

55:11.600 --> 55:13.600
We'll just call that one like green.

55:13.600 --> 55:19.600
I have some hit lines for Fifty Shades of Grey.

55:19.600 --> 55:20.600
If you guys just want to try these on.

55:20.600 --> 55:21.600
Okay.

55:21.600 --> 55:23.600
We could try to put these in the podcast.

55:23.600 --> 55:24.600
Oh, good.

55:24.600 --> 55:25.600
This is going to be.

55:25.600 --> 55:26.600
Okay.

55:26.600 --> 55:30.600
I'd like to bite that lip.

55:30.600 --> 55:36.600
He whispers darkly, geez, I'm a quivering moist mess and he hasn't even touched me.

55:36.600 --> 55:40.600
I squirm in my seat and I meet this dark glare.

55:40.600 --> 55:41.600
Fuck.

55:41.600 --> 55:47.600
The muscles inside the deepest darkest part of me clenching the most delicious fashion.

55:47.600 --> 55:50.600
Where is it not dark in your body?

55:50.600 --> 55:52.600
There is no light in it.

55:52.600 --> 55:53.600
Go on, Travis.

55:53.600 --> 55:55.600
Suck me, baby.

55:55.600 --> 56:00.600
His thumb presses on my tongue and my mouth closes around him, sucking wildly.

56:00.600 --> 56:01.600
Holy fuck.

56:01.600 --> 56:04.600
This is wrong, but holy hell is it erotic.

56:04.600 --> 56:06.600
This is the dirtiest.

56:06.600 --> 56:12.600
This is we have done a podcast where we talked about eating celebrity poop and fucking fowls.

56:12.600 --> 56:16.600
And this is the grossest thing I've ever read.

56:16.600 --> 56:20.600
I don't like that holy fuck is a standalone sentence.

56:20.600 --> 56:23.600
I only want period.

56:23.600 --> 56:24.600
Do one more.

56:24.600 --> 56:28.600
Oh, my, I didn't think it would feel like this.

56:28.600 --> 56:31.600
Didn't know it could feel as good as this.

56:31.600 --> 56:34.600
My thoughts are scattering like ectoplasm.

56:34.600 --> 56:36.600
There's only sensation.

56:36.600 --> 56:37.600
Only him.

56:37.600 --> 56:38.600
Only me.

56:38.600 --> 56:39.600
On, please.

56:39.600 --> 56:40.600
I stiffen.

56:40.600 --> 56:44.600
This is terrible.

56:44.600 --> 56:46.600
This is bad.

56:46.600 --> 56:47.600
This is badly.

56:47.600 --> 56:51.600
I want to say that this is proof that he is melting because the next one is Christian

56:51.600 --> 56:57.600
follows with two sharp thrusts and he freezes, pouring himself into me as he finds his release.

56:57.600 --> 56:59.600
Where'd you go?

56:59.600 --> 57:01.600
Ah, fuck.

57:01.600 --> 57:05.600
My insides practically contort with potent, meaty liquid desire.

57:05.600 --> 57:07.600
Guys, it's turning.

57:07.600 --> 57:08.600
She has diarrhea.

57:08.600 --> 57:09.600
So she basically has.

57:09.600 --> 57:14.600
Guys, it's turning from from being a goof to like being genuinely erotic.

57:14.600 --> 57:15.600
We need to be careful.

57:15.600 --> 57:18.600
We're walking on thin, thin, sexy ice.

57:18.600 --> 57:26.600
I was I was at books a million last weekend and I was checking out and the the woman in

57:26.600 --> 57:33.600
front of me is buying one book and as the cashier is putting it in the bag, he says,

57:33.600 --> 57:37.600
you know, a lot of people are reading that Fifty Shades of Grey just like that.

57:37.600 --> 57:41.600
And I think this dude legit did not know what the book is.

57:41.600 --> 57:44.600
Oh, or maybe he's just putting her on blast.

57:44.600 --> 57:46.600
You think he's blown up her spot?

57:46.600 --> 57:47.600
I think.

57:47.600 --> 57:48.600
I don't know.

57:48.600 --> 57:49.600
Although they're a shame.

57:49.600 --> 57:50.600
They are a shameless bunch.

57:50.600 --> 57:51.600
The fans of this book.

57:51.600 --> 57:55.600
I was sat on an airplane while a woman read it right next to me.

57:55.600 --> 57:56.600
She was reading it.

57:56.600 --> 57:59.600
She was reading about people just getting slammed, jammed and ram jammed.

57:59.600 --> 58:03.600
And she was she was thwibbing it right there.

58:03.600 --> 58:05.600
She's just flicking her beans.

58:05.600 --> 58:09.600
She was just thwibbing, thwibbing her acorn for all to see.

58:09.600 --> 58:10.600
Oh, man.

58:10.600 --> 58:12.600
Fifty Shades of Black.

58:12.600 --> 58:13.600
All right.

58:13.600 --> 58:17.600
Well, nobody listen wants to listen to this podcast anymore.

58:17.600 --> 58:19.600
I say we put up put it.

58:19.600 --> 58:24.600
We could reveal our fucking pin numbers and all of our Internet passwords right now and

58:24.600 --> 58:26.600
we would be a OK.

58:26.600 --> 58:28.600
Here's where I buried all the jobs.

58:28.600 --> 58:33.600
No one's going to find them because no one's listening.

58:33.600 --> 58:35.600
Not that anyone's listening, but this has been my brother, my brother, me.

58:35.600 --> 58:38.600
It's a comedy podcast we put out every Monday.

58:38.600 --> 58:42.600
If you're looking for something else to listen to on Mondays, I put out another show called

58:42.600 --> 58:44.600
Satellite Dish with my wife, Sydney.

58:44.600 --> 58:45.600
It's a podcast about TV.

58:45.600 --> 58:48.600
You can find that on iTunes and it comes out Mondays.

58:48.600 --> 58:53.600
It's part of what I'm calling the McElroy Fun Squad Monday.

58:53.600 --> 58:54.600
I infrequently.

58:54.600 --> 58:55.600
Sorry.

58:55.600 --> 58:59.600
I infrequently produce a podcast called In Case of Emergency.

58:59.600 --> 59:00.600
So you should check that out.

59:00.600 --> 59:05.600
But more importantly, if you're in the Cincinnati area or really anywhere around us coming up

59:05.600 --> 59:11.600
in October, I'm going to be in a steampunk version of William Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus

59:11.600 --> 59:13.600
at the Cincinnati Shakespeare Company.

59:13.600 --> 59:15.600
So come down and check it out.

59:15.600 --> 59:16.600
It's going to be awesome.

59:16.600 --> 59:17.600
Travis plays a robot.

59:17.600 --> 59:18.600
You can follow me.

59:18.600 --> 59:21.600
How about I don't have a podcast or show, but I'm on Twitter.

59:21.600 --> 59:23.600
It's Griffin McElroy on Twitter.

59:23.600 --> 59:26.600
I'm so close to 10,000 followers.

59:26.600 --> 59:30.600
For me, that is the celebrity hump.

59:30.600 --> 59:33.600
Once you get in five digits, you're there.

59:33.600 --> 59:35.600
You've made it.

59:35.600 --> 59:38.600
This is what I've learned from the Twitter follow account, Griffin.

59:38.600 --> 59:41.600
Justin is everybody's favorite because he has the most.

59:41.600 --> 59:44.600
And then you are the second favorite because you have the second most.

59:44.600 --> 59:48.600
And then the show itself is everyone's third favorite.

59:48.600 --> 59:51.600
And coming up last, it's me.

59:51.600 --> 59:55.600
So there are 2,000 people that like the show, but not me.

59:55.600 --> 59:57.600
Well, not big on Travis.

59:57.600 --> 59:59.600
They're not big Travis fans.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:03.600
To be fair, your tweets are, I'd say they leave a little bit to be desired.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.600
My tweets are delightful.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.600
Let's go through the list.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.600
Let's see.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.600
I ate a big ham this morning.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.600
And I've never said that.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.600
Watching Avatar The Last Airbender again.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.600
I just can't get enough mayonnaise.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.600
I detest mayonnaise, sir.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:28.600
But thank you to people who have downloaded the show, subscribed on iTunes, and reviewed it.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.600
That really means a lot and helps to boost us up there.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:36.600
So if you're looking for a way to say thank you, that would be a great way to do it.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.600
Say it with roses.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.600
Travis, how many Geena Davis retweets have you done in the past month?

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.600
All of them.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:50.600
Following Travis is like following Geena Davis twice.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:54.600
Well, that's because if you ever see Janet and Geena Davis, I'm right behind them.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.600
You retweet her tweet, and then you tweet at her, good one, Geena.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.600
You did it again, Gene.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.600
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.600
into Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.600
It was John Roderick's birthday last week.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.600
Happy belated birthday, John Roderick.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.600
I only know that because people talked about it on Twitter.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.600
I'm not like a stalker or anything like that.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.600
Oh, God, I just want to smell his hair.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.600
Oh, cool, cool, cool.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.600
We've got t-shirts and stuff, MaxFunStore.com if you want that.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.600
And there's other shows on the Maximum Fun Network.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.600
You can find them all at MaximumFun.org.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.600
They're all great.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.600
And we haven't mentioned it in a while, but we got a couple people asking this week,

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:44.600
if you are interested in doing a Jumbotron or you have a personal message or a business message or anything like that,

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:49.600
just go to MaximumFun.org forward slash Jumbotron and all the information is there.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:54.600
Oh, oh, oh, before I forget, we've had a lot of people asking about this, too.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:02:01.600
If you'd like the first 30 or so episodes of the show that are not on the Maximum Fun Network,

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.600
you can find all those at MBMBAM.Libson.com.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.600
Just click through the archives there.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.600
And on the right side, you can see all the years we've been doing the show.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.600
The first one is in April of 2010.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.600
You can see the hit art that I made for it before Justin Russo did it.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:27.600
And it's just a picture of the three of us on Mars near an ocean, and we all have mustaches.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.600
And it's not very good art, but it has a special place in my heart.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:38.600
That was back when we were using a theme song from, let's call them a very litigious Swedish pop group.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:44.600
Yeah, so you can go back to all the old episodes that are there for your enjoyment.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.600
Thanks for the years.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.600
Thanks for being with us and enjoying us.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.600
This is episode 120.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.600
We're going to be back next week with 121.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.600
That seems like a lot. That seems like a pretty big...

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.600
It seems like we're coming to the end.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.600
Yeah, when do we get to stop?

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:00.600
Never.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:04.600
I pledge to the listeners of this podcast that we will never stop doing it until one of us dies.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:05.600
How's that?

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:06.600
That seems...

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.600
And then there will be a very touching slideshow.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.600
Or until we stop making money off of it, because...

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600
Yeah.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.600
Until we stop making money off of it, that's really going to be...

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.600
As soon as that sweet money well dries up, we're going to dip.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:24.600
I think that there's always going to be a market, though, for people to pay us to make fun of George Lopez for them.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.600
Take care of my legwork, my brother, my brother, me.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.600
So you don't have to.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:35.600
So anyway, in closing, Griffin's going to ask us one more question.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.600
This final Yahoo was sent in by Gray. Thanks, Gray.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:43.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Monolithic Vulgarity, who asks,

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:47.600
Does anyone have a recording of a duck having an orgasm?

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.600
I am Justin McElroy.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.600
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.600
I am Ernie Hudson.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:59.600
This has been my brother, my brother, and may it kiss your dad.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:26.600
And we're on the web.
