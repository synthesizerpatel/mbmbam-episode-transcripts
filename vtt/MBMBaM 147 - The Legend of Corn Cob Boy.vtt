WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:45.920 --> 00:57.120
Ladies and gentlemen, Jurassic Park is back in IMAX and 3D, and to pay homage to the return

00:57.120 --> 01:02.560
of John Hammond's dream, we are broadcasting this special Max Fun Drive episode of My Brother,

01:02.560 --> 01:15.520
My Brother, Me in IMAX and 3D and shit. What's a box? 40. No, what's a box? Tesseract.

01:15.520 --> 01:22.480
Tesseract sound and... What's that? The sound folds the space between your ears.

01:22.480 --> 01:29.680
D-box. We got D-box in it, and also lasers are in it.

01:29.680 --> 01:37.200
So it's much like the Jurassic Park relaunch. It's the same fucking movie. So yeah, I guess,

01:37.200 --> 01:42.640
yeah, $13 for a ticket for a movie I already saw. Okay. Yeah, that's cool. Did you change anything?

01:42.640 --> 01:46.160
Did you change anything? It could also be a lot more laughable now whenever they talk about

01:46.160 --> 01:51.520
hacking and her computer skills and the internet. Yeah. Yeah. What's that? No one knows.

01:52.160 --> 01:59.040
Reading the fucking reviews of this 40-year-old movie that has been re-released. This is an

01:59.040 --> 02:04.880
excerpt from Richard Corliss, Time Magazine's movie critic. The 3D process adds not just dimension,

02:04.880 --> 02:09.040
but depth. A technological extension of cinematographer Greg Toland's deep focus

02:09.040 --> 02:13.600
innovations in The Grapes of Wrath and Citizen Kane. The change in perspective creates greater

02:13.600 --> 02:19.920
intensity. Thanks, Dick. How's the fucking dinosaurs? How do they look? The depth in

02:20.480 --> 02:25.040
the field of focus is unlike anything I've ever seen in the original Jurassic Park.

02:25.040 --> 02:30.160
Just tell me about the fucking velociraptors. How sick are they? Are they still awesome?

02:30.160 --> 02:34.880
Here's what would totally make me go see that movie. If they added a short scene at the beginning

02:34.880 --> 02:41.920
with people digging in South America for the amber stuff, and they uncover a chunk of amber

02:41.920 --> 02:47.760
with a movie reel in it, and they're like, ah, we can remake it. We can do this again.

02:47.760 --> 02:53.120
Jurassic Park was impressive in 1993. 20 years later, it's flawless. Same fucking movie,

02:53.120 --> 02:57.680
dog. I didn't see it in 1993 going, where's my crispness? I actually slept through it because

02:57.680 --> 03:04.160
I was six. I was a sleepy bear. Yeah, you were so little. My joke that I have been leaning on

03:04.160 --> 03:09.600
and really deploying a lot recently is, and I actually just got a chance to do this yesterday.

03:09.600 --> 03:13.920
I was at the Tri-State Combo Convention, and someone told, I was there with Sydney,

03:13.920 --> 03:20.560
and we ran into a friend of hers, a coworker actually. He said, yeah, we're going to finish

03:20.560 --> 03:26.480
here, and then I'm going to go see Jurassic Park. And I said, oh man, you're just going to love it.

03:26.480 --> 03:31.360
It's really tense, and there's dinosaurs and stuff. I don't know how you've missed it this long.

03:31.360 --> 03:36.800
Spoiler alert. Life runs away. What's the joke? The joke is that everybody's already seen Jurassic

03:36.800 --> 03:42.960
Park, so it's not like he's seeing it. He didn't laugh either. Are you the same person that when

03:42.960 --> 03:46.000
Titanic came out, you're like, I hear the boat sinks at the end. Sorry, spoiler alert. Yeah,

03:46.000 --> 03:49.120
exactly. I hear the boat sinks. You're a horrible person. You're one of those fucking dicks.

03:50.080 --> 03:54.560
You're a horrible person. I'm not ruining the plot or anything. Hey, this is an advice show

03:54.560 --> 04:04.240
where we take your questions into wisdom. I want to start off with a question, and then we'll do

04:04.240 --> 04:11.520
other questions, and then I will stop recording. Just see where it goes. We should mention the

04:11.520 --> 04:16.160
second week of our Max Fun Drive two-week long spectacular. You're going to get a bonus length

04:16.160 --> 04:21.280
app this week, and we're going to tell you all about how important Justin just ejaculated.

04:21.280 --> 04:26.320
It is untenable to do this show for an hour, but I have to tell you guys, when you're staring down

04:26.320 --> 04:33.040
the barrel of an hour and 15 minutes of goofs, it is simply, simply incomprehensible to me.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.160
I don't know how I'm going to be funny that long. Well, it's going to be incomprehensible to our

04:36.160 --> 04:42.320
listeners as well. We'll see if they kick it with us for an hour and 15. Just relax with us and kick

04:42.320 --> 04:46.400
it. Here's our first question. Here's what we'll do. We'll just keep going until you all drop out.

04:46.400 --> 04:51.600
We're going to keep the show going, and you just bail, whatever. Yeah. We're playing chicken with

04:51.600 --> 04:55.760
you right now, dearly. No friction, zero friction. It's a free podcast. You don't have to, you know,

04:55.760 --> 05:00.800
you're not paying us. You should. You should be. Max Fun Drive 2013. Here's our first question.

05:00.800 --> 05:06.240
My girlfriend and I recently got into a bit of a tiff over a TV spoiler. She just started watching

05:06.240 --> 05:10.400
The X-Files, and I offhandedly mentioned that I heard it was no good after David Duchovny left.

05:10.400 --> 05:15.600
What the fuck? I didn't know that either. I've only seen like four seasons of X-Files.

05:15.600 --> 05:20.240
What the fuck? It was so bad when the Terminator showed up and started killing everyone.

05:21.680 --> 05:28.480
Where does he go? David Duchovny? He went to do Californication. Yeah. Have fun solving

05:28.480 --> 05:32.960
these alien mysteries. I'm going to go get my dick wet on the reg every day. I'm going to go

05:32.960 --> 05:38.880
have sex with Susan, it's a random daughter. Is that real? Yeah. No, I think she plays his daughter

05:38.880 --> 05:44.080
on the show. Or is that how it is? I don't know. I've never seen it. I hear it's pornographic.

05:44.080 --> 05:51.200
You're guessing then. When they're cut up like that, can one of them even continue on the X-Files?

05:52.240 --> 05:56.000
I don't think so. They're like, sorry, you're down to the J-Files now.

05:56.880 --> 06:02.240
I don't think you're ready for the X-Files anymore. When you had two of you, you were prepped. You

06:02.240 --> 06:07.840
had the faculties. Now I'm going to bump you down to J, maybe R if you're good. So she got a bit

06:07.840 --> 06:12.320
annoyed and considered it a spoiler, and he just considered it common knowledge about the program

06:12.320 --> 06:16.400
and its history. I wouldn't think it's a spoiler to say that Steve Carell eventually leaves the

06:16.400 --> 06:20.960
office or the doctor who eventually regenerates. They just seem like facts about the show.

06:20.960 --> 06:25.360
Brothers, what constitutes a spoiler? And that's from Spoiled in South Slope.

06:25.360 --> 06:32.080
This is interesting because I think it has to do with our modern age, with this modern era that

06:32.080 --> 06:36.720
we're trying to fucking get people through every day, through this wasteland that we're leading the

06:36.720 --> 06:43.120
underground railroad through, is the fucking, it's the internet. Like everything, it's the internet.

06:43.120 --> 06:49.280
Because in 1990, 80, when this fucking X-Files show was on, there was no internet. So David,

06:49.280 --> 06:52.400
the company left, you didn't know about it. The only reason, the only way you could watch it

06:52.400 --> 06:57.360
is on TV or on VHS that your dad recorded. I remember when it was on in 1990, 80 too.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.120
Yeah. For good years.

07:00.080 --> 07:03.440
It's a super old show, is what I'm saying. Office, Steve Carell leaves the show,

07:03.440 --> 07:07.280
and fucking people are on the street with it tattooed on their goddamn face.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.480
They have a hyperlink to a Huffington Post article about Steve Carell leaving,

07:10.480 --> 07:11.520
tattooed on their face. Everybody knows it.

07:11.520 --> 07:17.280
This is also different though because in this, that has happened since, like okay,

07:18.080 --> 07:22.160
I don't think you could have escaped the news of Steve Carell leaving the office. That happened

07:22.160 --> 07:28.080
post internet age. David, the company leaving the X-Files though, that was a long time ago.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.360
That was probably before the internet.

07:29.360 --> 07:35.040
But Justin, to finish out your argument, that's like saying like, Darth is Luke's father. Oh,

07:35.040 --> 07:37.200
what the shit? Spoiler alert, man.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.600
That is a spoiler. I don't know why you'd do that.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.400
I'm sorry. I didn't say his last name. It could be Darth anybody.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.040
You could still spoil loss for people, is what I'm saying.

07:47.040 --> 07:47.440
Could you?

07:47.440 --> 07:53.200
I still think there's a, I still think that loss spoilers are like in effect, I feel like.

07:53.200 --> 07:57.760
So let's, there's a hierarchy, right? Let's rank them. Number one, Breaking Bad. If you

07:57.760 --> 08:01.520
fucking say anything that has ever happened throughout the fullness of Breaking Bad,

08:01.520 --> 08:03.360
you're a bag of dicks.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.920
But I will say that the difference is that's still running.

08:06.800 --> 08:07.440
It's not.

08:07.440 --> 08:10.400
Right, that's what I'm saying. That's the, that's the, I'm establishing,

08:10.400 --> 08:15.920
I'm establishing the worst thing you can do. And to me, that is Breaking Bad.

08:16.720 --> 08:21.360
Even like Game of Thrones, there's books. So like people can read that shit if they want to know.

08:21.360 --> 08:26.080
You know what I mean? Breaking Bad, number one. And then, I mean, it goes down the whole AMC

08:26.080 --> 08:28.880
list, right? I've never watched Mad Men. If somebody told me shit about Mad Men,

08:28.880 --> 08:30.960
I'd be upset because I'm going to get there one day.

08:30.960 --> 08:34.080
You'll get there eventually. What do you, what is it that you're waiting for?

08:34.640 --> 08:39.600
I'm waiting for them. I watch an episode and just the way they treat those women is just like.

08:39.600 --> 08:40.560
It's too much for you.

08:40.560 --> 08:44.880
It really is too much. I'm watching it like Beyonce, like, like, baby, I,

08:45.440 --> 08:48.240
baby, I'm sorry that they, that things were like this back then.

08:48.240 --> 08:52.080
And they still are like this in parts of the world. Third world, second world countries,

08:52.080 --> 08:55.680
developing nations, California, Californication.

08:56.480 --> 09:00.880
Sometimes spending too long in a world without internet, even via television or

09:01.760 --> 09:06.080
ironically, the internet makes you feel like fucking claustrophobic.

09:06.080 --> 09:10.320
When I look at them and I realized that that is a phone on their desk and it is not anything

09:10.320 --> 09:14.320
other than a phone on their desk. Like, and that's how they do their work. And if they need to,

09:15.680 --> 09:19.520
I get a little, it's a little much for me. It's a little dour.

09:19.520 --> 09:22.400
Yeah. That's what makes the amazing race so difficult.

09:22.400 --> 09:27.680
Because there are these countries, you get exposed to what people are living like in other.

09:27.680 --> 09:32.640
And some people are like, I saw people on that show dancing and it didn't seem to be for like

09:32.640 --> 09:35.600
money or anything. They just seem to be dancing to pass the time.

09:35.600 --> 09:40.480
Yeah. Well, that's, well, I mean, it's also the most beautiful thing.

09:42.640 --> 09:45.280
It's the most beautiful thing in the world that people are just dancing

09:45.280 --> 09:49.040
for the, for the feel of it. You know what I mean?

09:49.040 --> 09:49.840
Not for tips or anything?

09:50.560 --> 09:54.400
No, no. Well, actually in this, in this scenario.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.600
In this particular challenge, they had to get $10 in tips before they could bounce, but.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.120
Okay. Okay.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.600
A hundred rand if memory serves.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.960
I would, I would say that the funny thing of this question is the opposite side of

10:04.960 --> 10:09.520
this question is when you start watching the show after it's already been on like 10 years.

10:09.520 --> 10:12.880
She can't roll up to her friends and be like, oh my God, you guys,

10:12.880 --> 10:16.400
I just found this new show is called X-Files. You should all check it out.

10:16.400 --> 10:23.280
But like, okay. I think there's a converse relation to the statute of limitations ending

10:23.920 --> 10:28.720
and the value of like talking about it.

10:30.080 --> 10:34.400
I think it's just, just be fucking polite. Like, have you watched X-Files?

10:34.400 --> 10:40.560
Yes. Man, when, when, when Chovny leaves, it really takes a nosedive. Yeah, I know.

10:40.560 --> 10:44.720
I was there when that happened so I can talk to you about it. Hey, have you seen X-Files?

10:44.720 --> 10:46.800
No, I haven't. Well, then I'm not going to tell you about this.

10:46.800 --> 10:52.080
Hey, and Guy, can I just like double underline that what you said about it,

10:52.720 --> 10:57.360
she said she's enjoying this new program. And for you to come along and be like, oh,

10:57.360 --> 11:02.160
oh, enjoy it while it lasts. Cause I hear it gets shitty. It drives me fucking crazy when

11:02.160 --> 11:08.640
people do that. They'll try to do any discussion of the West wing. It is always like, just make

11:08.640 --> 11:12.960
sure you stop watching before after season five. Well, fuck those people because six and seven

11:12.960 --> 11:19.840
gets good. But the thing is about West Wing, and I'm sure other shows are like this too,

11:19.840 --> 11:24.400
is it takes persistence. I fucked up my first time watching West Wing. I watched that

11:24.400 --> 11:31.280
fucking episode in season five. Oh, that fucking episode where he's like, shut it down. And then

11:31.280 --> 11:35.920
I did shut down my Xbox and I stopped watching the goddamn television program because it was so bad.

11:35.920 --> 11:41.440
No, I mean, and it gets crazy. And John Goodman's president for a while. It gets fucking nuts.

11:41.440 --> 11:47.440
But we just spoiled, you just fucking spoiled something, Justin. Justin? What? You just fucking,

11:47.440 --> 11:50.800
somebody's listening right now that's on season four and a half of West Wing. Like,

11:50.800 --> 11:54.320
can't wait to experience this in my own, in real time. And you just fucking looped on.

11:54.320 --> 11:58.320
It's going to be such a heightened, no, it is, I have heightened the experience

11:58.320 --> 12:02.240
because if you're watching West Wing and constantly wondering, is this when John

12:02.240 --> 12:06.960
Goodman becomes president? Can I see? Is he bit by John Goodman and at the full moon,

12:06.960 --> 12:09.600
he transforms into- He becomes Goodman.

12:09.600 --> 12:16.480
That's not outside the realm of- Your hand looked like a shoulder stake. I'm sorry,

12:16.480 --> 12:21.840
I don't know what to tell you. I just read a great Onion article where it was about a friend

12:21.840 --> 12:28.320
one season ahead and TV show of another friend gives him mystic wisdom about upcoming events.

12:28.320 --> 12:32.960
And that's what, and that's, let's not lie. Like that's exactly when we talk about how six and

12:32.960 --> 12:37.040
seven gets so much better and you guys, oh, you got to stick with it. It's because we're so fucking

12:37.040 --> 12:42.320
cultured and experienced and- Oh, when someone says like, oh, have you made it to season three yet?

12:42.320 --> 12:48.080
Ah, just wait for season three. They're not doing that to help you. They're not your friends.

12:49.440 --> 12:53.200
Sometimes though they're helping. Like when they say that, make sure you stick around for season

12:53.200 --> 12:57.920
2.5 of Battlestar. You might not know that there is a 2.5, you might skip it, go straight to three

12:57.920 --> 13:02.480
and then you're like, where's Starbuck? A lot of shows are hard to watch.

13:02.480 --> 13:07.760
Battlestar Galacta is hard to like watch right. Like you can mess it up very easily.

13:07.760 --> 13:12.800
You got to go 3.2 up to 4.1 and then you got to drop back down to 3.8 for the webisodes.

13:14.160 --> 13:19.280
A lot of important canonical extensions in those webisodes. So don't miss it. You got to watch

13:19.280 --> 13:26.000
Razor, Razor, Razor 2, drop back to Caprica, hop back on for Heart of the Swarm and then drop

13:26.000 --> 13:33.360
back down. You got to watch Razor, but backwards. So, Spoilers on a Slope, in short, you were the

13:33.360 --> 13:37.040
jerk this time. Because it was really silly of you to tell her it gets bad. Like what,

13:37.040 --> 13:41.280
why would you even say that? Unless you were warning her that it gets better,

13:41.280 --> 13:44.640
which I don't think it does. Sorry, X-Files. You guys want a Yahoo?

13:45.280 --> 13:48.880
Yeah, yeah I do. This Yahoo was sent in by two different people,

13:49.520 --> 13:52.720
one of whom was Jacob Blocker, one of whom was Jack Howard. I don't know how it happened.

13:52.720 --> 13:57.040
It's a mystical occurrence. Are they working together?

13:57.040 --> 14:00.480
I think that they fucking work together, except they were sent like days apart. So they probably

14:00.480 --> 14:04.640
found it together and then Jack was like, yeah, let's wait until Tuesday to send this in. And then

14:04.640 --> 14:10.800
he fucking got the jump on it on Saturday. Anyway, thank you both. It's by Yahoo Institute user

14:10.800 --> 14:25.280
Manuel who asks, is it okay to eat in the bathroom at McDonald's? Hi. Hello. How are you? Whenever I

14:25.280 --> 14:29.120
go to McDonald's, I always eat in the bathroom. I've been doing this for five years now without

14:29.120 --> 14:36.720
a problem. I think that saying without a problem is very generous.

14:36.720 --> 14:42.560
Well, yeah, let's break that term down. Like the fucking McDonald's bouncer's not going to kick the

14:42.560 --> 14:46.960
door and be like, I've been following your trail for five years. It goes straight from the fucking

14:46.960 --> 14:50.000
cash register to the bathroom. So it was not a very difficult trail to follow.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.960
You got to think though, that if he's been going to the same McDonald's,

14:52.960 --> 14:58.400
that the cashiers are starting to talk. Oh, I hope he's not going to- I hope nobody's

14:58.400 --> 15:02.240
going to the same McDonald's. Except for that dude in Supersize Me.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.480
Oh, new guy, don't worry. That's just bathroom Steve.

15:04.480 --> 15:09.360
That dude in Supersize Me, who's like, I ate 5,000 Big Macs. I eat six a day. And it's like,

15:10.400 --> 15:14.480
that's great. But like, can you do them at different McDonald's's? So they're not like,

15:14.480 --> 15:16.960
oh, here comes Big Mac Mac. Cause his name's Mac.

15:17.760 --> 15:18.720
His name is also Mac.

15:18.720 --> 15:19.920
His name is also Mac.

15:19.920 --> 15:20.720
Can you-

15:20.720 --> 15:23.040
And it's like, why wouldn't you just call him Big Mac? If that's the case.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.320
Can you imagine-

15:24.320 --> 15:27.600
Well, cause he was actually very thin, if I remember correctly. He was a thin man.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.320
He was fucking disgusting.

15:28.320 --> 15:33.040
Can you imagine you're on a road trip, you park a car, you park a car,

15:33.040 --> 15:37.840
you park, you pull into a McDonald's, you run, you make a rush for the bathroom,

15:37.840 --> 15:41.040
promising yourself that you'll go back and buy a Hi-C or something.

15:41.040 --> 15:46.960
You go to the bathroom, you open the stall door, and there's just this guy,

15:46.960 --> 15:50.240
hunched over, jamming chicken strips into his-

15:50.240 --> 15:54.800
Occupied, occupied, occupied with flavor.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.760
Is he voiding though, while he eats, is the question.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.080
I should hope not.

16:00.080 --> 16:04.320
Is this, have we ever told the corncob story?

16:04.320 --> 16:06.080
I feel like we have to have told the corncob story,

16:06.080 --> 16:07.840
cause it's the best thing that's ever happened.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.600
No, to my knowledge, we have not.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.360
The perfect diagram of efficiency that is the corncob story.

16:13.360 --> 16:17.440
The corncob story is, we were at a trailer, trailer park?

16:17.440 --> 16:17.840
No.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.120
It was a trailer park campground.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.960
It was a trailer park campground, which is like,

16:20.960 --> 16:23.280
I don't care how fucking temporary your stay is,

16:23.280 --> 16:26.560
you're living in a trailer park for the period that you were there.

16:26.560 --> 16:31.360
We were staying there with our cousins or uncles or, I think it was Tim and Tom, right?

16:31.360 --> 16:35.360
And so we were staying there, and we were walking the grounds,

16:35.360 --> 16:39.680
seeing the sights, checking out, scoping some whinnies.

16:39.680 --> 16:46.240
And we went to the bathroom, and it was one of those deplorable kinds of bathrooms,

16:46.240 --> 16:48.000
with no doors on the stalls.

16:48.880 --> 16:49.760
So like, those technically aren't even-

16:49.760 --> 16:50.720
Which are not bathrooms.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.400
In my opinion, they're not bathrooms.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.360
They're not bathrooms.

16:53.360 --> 16:57.280
They're fucking temporary concentration camps that you can walk out of.

16:57.280 --> 17:00.000
They're risky water fountains, as far as I'm concerned.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.040
There's nothing-

17:01.040 --> 17:02.720
They're little public jails.

17:02.720 --> 17:07.440
And we walked in, and I was walking, you know,

17:07.440 --> 17:10.800
just checking to see if maybe one of these fucking stalls had a door on it,

17:10.800 --> 17:14.800
because it's 1999, and we're living in a civilized goddamn world.

17:15.840 --> 17:17.920
And kind of, I mean, we were in a trailer park.

17:17.920 --> 17:25.520
And walked by one stall, and I didn't look long,

17:26.080 --> 17:27.440
because it's like, I guess, a crime.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.680
But there was a little kid, I would say half chubby.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.680
I mean, he was half fat.

17:33.680 --> 17:38.160
Not either party in this scenario was half chubby.

17:38.160 --> 17:41.040
He was this half fat kid, and he was sitting there taking a poop.

17:41.040 --> 17:47.920
And while he was taking a poop, he was also eating some corn on the cob.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.400
He was eating his corn on the cob while voiding.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.960
And I walked out and made a hand gesture to-

17:54.960 --> 17:56.000
I forget who was with me.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.720
I made a hand gesture, like a fucking SWAT team.

17:58.720 --> 17:59.680
Like, I can't talk.

17:59.680 --> 18:00.080
I can't-

18:00.080 --> 18:02.480
I'm about to lose my fucking mind laughing.

18:02.480 --> 18:06.320
You need to go walk eight feet in that direction and look westward.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.640
Turn your eyes westward towards-

18:08.640 --> 18:11.600
Corncob boy.

18:11.600 --> 18:11.840
Corncob boy.

18:11.840 --> 18:12.960
And then we'll talk-

18:12.960 --> 18:13.520
We will-

18:13.520 --> 18:18.560
I did a little loop with my finger to say we will do some recon later on this.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.680
We will get together and discuss it in a group.

18:22.880 --> 18:23.600
Not now, though.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.200
For now, we are completely-

18:25.200 --> 18:25.600
Not now.

18:25.600 --> 18:26.800
I need your total silence.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.480
We're deep within enemy territory.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.440
I need you to walk there.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.520
I need it to be very clear that I did not say,

18:31.520 --> 18:33.600
hey, go check out this kid with no pants on.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.320
You have to keep it totally cash.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.280
You got to keep it cash.

18:37.280 --> 18:37.920
Cash.

18:37.920 --> 18:38.320
Turn.

18:38.320 --> 18:38.560
Say-

18:38.560 --> 18:40.000
Oh, excuse me.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.560
Say, like, excuse me, or how's that corn?

18:43.840 --> 18:47.520
Pretty good, I bet, since you couldn't fucking tear yourself away from it.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.560
Couldn't leave it on the pic-a-nic table.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.400
Go void.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.280
Go evacuate, and then return to your biz.

18:56.480 --> 19:00.240
There was a moment in this kid's life where he was eating corn,

19:00.240 --> 19:01.920
realized he needed to use the bathroom with the-

19:01.920 --> 19:03.760
Well, I can't leave this here.

19:03.760 --> 19:04.400
I get it.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.360
I mean, he buttered it.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.680
And once you butter it, it's like, that's your day.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.080
Yeah.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.160
That's your day until it's done.

19:10.160 --> 19:10.800
That's your day.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.840
Have you ever thought about it from this kid's point of view,

19:14.480 --> 19:17.120
that maybe, like, Griffin's acknowledgement of him

19:17.120 --> 19:20.560
and, like, just the look on Griffin's face changed this kid's life?

19:20.560 --> 19:21.360
Turned his life around.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.800
That kid grew up Steve Jobs.

19:22.800 --> 19:23.760
He grew up super fast.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.760
He grew up Steve Jobs.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.960
Anyway, maybe that's what this kid-

19:30.960 --> 19:32.400
Maybe that's who's asking this question.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.760
It's fine, right?

19:33.760 --> 19:35.600
Um, it's not okay.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.160
I mean, I get it.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.960
Like, I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.000
It's not just McDonald's.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
It's anything going inside of a fast food restaurant when I-

19:45.040 --> 19:45.520
You know what I mean?

19:45.520 --> 19:48.240
Like, unless I am on a road trip and I'm going to use the bathroom,

19:48.240 --> 19:50.960
I'm never like, hey, you guys want to get out and eat inside?

19:50.960 --> 19:52.560
Like, the answer to that question is always no.

19:52.560 --> 19:52.880
No.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.320
I can't even imagine-

19:54.320 --> 19:58.960
I don't understand why most fast food restaurants have dining rooms.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.080
Like, I really-

20:00.080 --> 20:02.880
I think it's- It's also, I think, for kids' parties in the 90s.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.040
I think it's one of those vestig-

20:05.040 --> 20:05.680
Yes.

20:05.680 --> 20:09.040
It's one of those like crazy vestigial things of-

20:09.680 --> 20:13.360
There was a simpler time in the 1950s where you would go

20:13.360 --> 20:15.920
and Speedy would bring you out a tasty burger,

20:16.480 --> 20:17.440
bring it right out to you,

20:17.440 --> 20:19.440
and you'd sit there with your family after church,

20:20.080 --> 20:22.480
and it would smell so clean.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.480
And now, like, that's not-

20:24.480 --> 20:27.280
Every McDonald's, it's been around for longer than six months.

20:27.280 --> 20:30.320
It's like caked in funk, and you have to-

20:30.320 --> 20:32.480
That's not fair or accurate.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.080
McDonald's are pristine.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.800
Many McDonald's are pristine.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.120
Some McDonald's are clean.

20:39.120 --> 20:39.760
Okay.

20:39.760 --> 20:40.240
Okay.

20:40.240 --> 20:40.880
You're right.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.880
When was the last time you were inside a steak and shake?

20:44.880 --> 20:45.840
I don't think I've been here.

20:45.840 --> 20:46.640
They don't have those here.

20:46.640 --> 20:47.920
Well, because it is that.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.760
Like, it's an actual, like, restaurant inside,

20:49.760 --> 20:52.880
and like that full-on you walk into a time warp and you're in the 50s.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.200
Yeah.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.800
And like, there's families everywhere.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.920
It's crazy. Sorry, tangent, but it blows my mind.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.600
So if you want to see some families,

20:59.600 --> 21:01.600
cruise on down to the steak and shake,

21:01.600 --> 21:04.800
and you can scope all the families, all the families you like.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.640
I just go down there and family watch, you know what I mean?

21:06.640 --> 21:11.040
And if you want to see a half-fat kid eating corn on the cob,

21:11.040 --> 21:12.080
if you want to see-

21:12.080 --> 21:13.680
I know what you're talking about, though,

21:13.680 --> 21:16.880
because you don't see that in adults, really,

21:16.880 --> 21:19.360
but like, you would see that in little kids a lot,

21:19.360 --> 21:21.680
mainly because, I guess, little kids have to have their show.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.960
Yeah, but like, you would see kids who are like skinny

21:24.960 --> 21:27.920
to about like three inches above their belly button,

21:27.920 --> 21:28.880
and then they're fat below there.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.240
And then it got around, yeah.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.600
It's like bingo from the biggest-

21:31.600 --> 21:35.760
this latest season, the biggest loser, except like after, after he-

21:35.760 --> 21:37.840
and like, I don't want to fucking put bingo on blast,

21:37.840 --> 21:39.440
and I don't want to salt his game or anything like that,

21:39.440 --> 21:40.800
because he worked really hard.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.080
He had a broken ankle for a long time,

21:42.080 --> 21:43.920
and he still managed to drop like 70 pounds,

21:43.920 --> 21:46.480
which for a 10-year-old kid is like everything,

21:46.480 --> 21:48.160
but he was still a little weak.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.440
Yeah, he was a little weak.

21:49.440 --> 21:52.880
Everything, but he was still a little, little, you know what I mean?

21:52.880 --> 21:54.160
They're mean to him on that show.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.200
Did you read about-

21:55.200 --> 21:57.440
Oh man, it is a brutal environment.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.080
Yeah, well, yeah, because you had fucking Jillian Michaels like,

22:00.080 --> 22:04.240
if you don't eat this okra, you're gonna eat my shit!

22:04.240 --> 22:06.320
And then she put shit down Bingo's throat.

22:07.040 --> 22:10.240
Hey, speaking of eating stuff, I can't eat eggs.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.800
Not because of allergenic reasons.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.040
Ever since I was a toddler,

22:15.040 --> 22:17.200
I just couldn't bring myself to eat them.

22:17.200 --> 22:20.720
Scrambled, poached, boiled, even mixed with fried rice.

22:20.720 --> 22:21.360
You name it.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.800
Over the years, I've tried it.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.080
Can't even chew them.

22:24.080 --> 22:24.960
Really want to like them.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.760
Not only for the protein content,

22:27.760 --> 22:30.400
but my GF apparently makes devastating scrambled eggs

22:30.400 --> 22:31.440
that I would love to try.

22:32.080 --> 22:36.240
Oh, brothers, what can I do to change my senses and love eggs?

22:36.240 --> 22:37.120
That's from eggs.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.760
Eggervated in Egan.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.600
I have a hard time not picturing him

22:43.600 --> 22:44.800
putting eggs in his mouth and going,

22:44.800 --> 22:45.680
it's not working!

22:45.680 --> 22:47.200
I can't do it!

22:48.160 --> 22:50.640
How do you move your teeth around these things?

22:50.640 --> 22:52.400
How does anyone eat eggs?

22:52.400 --> 22:54.640
This reminds me of Bingo from Biggest Loser

22:54.640 --> 22:55.760
trying to eat vegetables.

22:55.760 --> 22:56.400
Can't do it.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.440
You can lead a horse to water,

22:57.440 --> 22:58.960
but you can't make Bingo eat vegetables.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.320
That's what Bingo's dad always says.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.760
I don't understand the question.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.440
You don't like them, you mean?

23:07.440 --> 23:10.560
Because it's okay not to like some food.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.720
Can I say, listen, I get it.

23:12.720 --> 23:15.360
Because this is how I feel about mayonnaise.

23:17.360 --> 23:18.720
But I have no reason.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.160
I have no justification.

23:20.160 --> 23:21.600
There is no background to it.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.720
I just don't want to eat it.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.720
That's crazy that you don't like mayonnaise, first of all.

23:24.720 --> 23:25.440
I get it.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.200
Do you know what mayonnaise is, Travis, right now?

23:27.200 --> 23:29.440
Can you tell me right now what mayonnaise is?

23:29.440 --> 23:31.840
It's basically just like solid fat.

23:31.840 --> 23:32.160
No.

23:32.160 --> 23:32.880
It's oil.

23:32.880 --> 23:33.840
No, you're wrong.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.400
It's an egg and it's oil and that's all that it is.

23:36.960 --> 23:39.280
I know for a fucking fact you love both of those things.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.600
You will fry an egg in oil and you'll eat that.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.240
That's mayonnaise.

23:42.240 --> 23:45.360
Better men than you have tried to dissect my problem with mayonnaise.

23:45.360 --> 23:46.880
No, mayonnaise is gross.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.400
You don't want to know the messed up thing?

23:48.400 --> 23:48.720
What?

23:48.720 --> 23:52.240
If it's like on something and I'm unaware of it, I have no problem with it.

23:52.240 --> 23:52.640
Oh, sure.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.480
But if someone says like, do you want mayonnaise on it?

23:54.480 --> 23:55.120
I'm like, oh, no.

23:55.120 --> 23:59.600
But that's mayonnaise's only job is to fucking ghost it on a sandwich to make it a little wetter.

23:59.600 --> 23:59.840
That's it.

23:59.840 --> 24:00.960
This is my problem, though.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.440
But like, here's the thing with all condiments.

24:03.440 --> 24:06.880
And I stayed away from condiments for a good part of my life.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.560
Because it feels better to just be natural.

24:08.560 --> 24:09.760
Because I just want a raw dog.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.400
Just want a raw sandwich.

24:12.400 --> 24:17.840
No, I stayed away from it because people would, restaurants especially, will always over apply.

24:20.160 --> 24:23.680
A little thin layer of mayo can be appealing.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.760
But you don't ever get that anywhere.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.160
It's like, that's how much mayo you get.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.200
You get how much of mayo.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.280
How much mayo would you like a, or would you like?

24:34.800 --> 24:35.520
That's what you get.

24:35.520 --> 24:40.880
I always, if I bite a sandwich and mayonnaise gooshes out of it,

24:40.880 --> 24:43.600
my dining experience has come to an abrupt halt.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.320
That's the end of my dining experience.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.120
You bite it and then like a solid jet of it shoots out.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.440
And it gets on your grandma.

24:51.440 --> 24:54.000
And then that's Nutty Professor 3.

24:54.880 --> 24:55.520
You're welcome.

24:55.520 --> 24:56.880
You're welcome, Nutty Professor 3.

24:56.880 --> 24:57.840
Enjoy the clumps.

24:57.840 --> 25:01.200
So I'm betting that this guy's problem is like purely mental.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.720
That it's just like, oh, eggs?

25:02.720 --> 25:03.280
No.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.720
Eggs is a big fucking.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.240
That's a huge.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.920
I don't, I couldn't make it without eggs.

25:07.920 --> 25:08.480
Couldn't make it.

25:08.480 --> 25:09.840
How do you eat breakfast tacos?

25:09.840 --> 25:12.080
I ate eggs inside my breakfast tacos yesterday.

25:12.640 --> 25:15.200
I'd say like, it's a four times a week thing for me.

25:16.080 --> 25:20.080
You can't see the thing though where it's like, oh, that's like a chicken baby.

25:20.080 --> 25:20.800
Oh, it's not that.

25:20.800 --> 25:21.440
I don't think it's that.

25:21.440 --> 25:24.400
It doesn't seem to be conceptually bothering this person.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.400
I think maybe you should just start trying different styles.

25:29.040 --> 25:33.680
Like you need to find a handhold in the world of eggs.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.240
And then like build from there.

25:36.240 --> 25:39.120
Eggs are a protein and they are a vehicle for other flavors.

25:39.120 --> 25:42.080
And that vehicle can be delivered in so many different ways.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.760
That's what's craziest to me.

25:43.760 --> 25:47.680
Is you can fucking disguise it in so many.

25:47.680 --> 25:51.120
I put a little Fox Point seasoning in it and a little salt and a little pepper.

25:51.120 --> 25:51.600
And that's it.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.200
And it doesn't taste anything like eggs.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.040
Tastes like fucking Fox Point seasoning.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.720
What's Fox Point seasoning?

25:56.720 --> 25:58.640
It's a, you know, it's a special, I don't know.

25:58.640 --> 26:03.520
It just came with the, it came with the seasoning set that Rachel got me for my birthday.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.320
A couple of years ago.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.120
And it's fucking delicious.

26:07.120 --> 26:10.800
Hey, here's some free, speaking of spices, here's some free advice to everybody.

26:10.800 --> 26:11.200
Yeah.

26:11.200 --> 26:15.120
If it's been a few years since you've used a spice, check the expiration date on it.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.240
Oh, Fox Point doesn't go bad.

26:16.240 --> 26:20.720
It won't ever hurt you, but you will really lose a lot of potency.

26:20.720 --> 26:24.400
I bought some new crushed red pepper flakes and I stopped using the jar I've been using

26:24.400 --> 26:25.040
for five years.

26:25.600 --> 26:29.760
I bought some new crushed red pepper flakes and it was honestly, it was like being able

26:29.760 --> 26:32.480
to taste again after being in some sort of heat loop.

26:32.480 --> 26:36.000
See, I just go to, I just go to Pizza Hut during, when they have their lunch buffet

26:36.000 --> 26:38.800
and I just scoop up the red pepper flakes, just throw them in my pocket.

26:38.800 --> 26:39.840
Fill your pockets full.

26:39.840 --> 26:42.320
Fill my pockets, just put, you know, pepper flakes and Parmesan.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.200
I do the same thing with the carrot shreddings.

26:46.400 --> 26:47.520
Those are delicious.

26:47.520 --> 26:54.480
My jam with eggs right now, and this is really delicious, is I make an omelet and I cook

26:54.480 --> 27:01.600
some apple slices in brandy and cinnamon and then put the apple slices into the omelet.

27:01.600 --> 27:05.760
I learned that from the Frugal Gourmet, who it turns out is a child molester guy, sort

27:05.760 --> 27:06.320
of.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.280
Oh no!

27:07.280 --> 27:08.160
I know, right?

27:08.160 --> 27:09.360
I was so bummed.

27:09.360 --> 27:15.520
That story just went from my extreme fascination of cinnamon apples and eggs.

27:15.520 --> 27:16.560
Why haven't, aw man.

27:18.000 --> 27:23.680
But no, guys, seriously, he taught me how to make the best omelets and I don't, you know,

27:23.680 --> 27:25.440
he can have a kid or two as far as I'm concerned.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.440
That's not, oh no, Justin, no!

27:27.440 --> 27:28.720
I don't mean it like that.

27:28.720 --> 27:31.440
We don't need to lay a sacrifice at the feet of the Frugal Gourmet.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.760
I'm not gonna sit here and pass judgment on Frugal Gourmet.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.200
Okay, Justin, what if that kid was corncob boy?

27:37.200 --> 27:38.240
Now don't you feel bad.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.000
Isn't there egg on your face?

27:41.440 --> 27:42.560
Just eat these fucking eggs.

27:42.560 --> 27:45.760
You can, oh my god, there's eggs in everything you eat.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.280
I have a second suggestion that might help.

27:49.280 --> 27:49.760
What's that?

27:50.320 --> 27:55.920
I mean, it's how you train dogs, but have a little bit egg along with your favorite

27:55.920 --> 28:00.640
kind of food and just pair them together until eventually you're gonna create a new

28:00.640 --> 28:04.720
connection that eggs are good and they remind you of your favorite food.

28:04.720 --> 28:08.000
Put a little bit of egg on the tip of your nose and then when I ring this bell,

28:08.000 --> 28:09.760
I want you to jump up and grab it.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.680
You laugh, but that'd be a really impressive trick.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.760
It would be because eggs are super floppy.

28:13.760 --> 28:20.160
I made the mistake this week of, I thought the Onion AV Club, when they did podcast reviews,

28:20.160 --> 28:25.680
they only like did them about episodes that were good and a few weeks ago,

28:25.680 --> 28:31.600
we, I guess we put up a rock as they say in the e-ball world and they said like,

28:31.600 --> 28:34.880
they called us on and they said, wow, they really threw an air ball this time.

28:34.880 --> 28:35.920
Real clunker.

28:35.920 --> 28:42.320
And now like anytime we're recording, the only voice I can hear is the voice of the AV Club.

28:42.320 --> 28:47.280
So they're like, there is a prolonged 20 minute discussion of egg preparation.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.560
I do not recommend to anyone.

28:50.560 --> 28:55.600
Right, but then you go fucking switch over to egg blog podcast reviews and they're like,

28:55.600 --> 28:58.720
A plus, best ep ever.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.080
Go see it, five stars.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.000
Drop some money on them.

29:02.720 --> 29:09.600
Finally, the McElroy's break their three year long egg silence and fucking get on.

29:09.600 --> 29:14.160
Actually it is three years on the 30th, right?

29:14.160 --> 29:17.200
Wednesday, the 10th, April 10th was our first time.

29:17.200 --> 29:21.680
Jesus Christ, I can't fucking believe how long you've been doing this stupid goddamn show.

29:21.680 --> 29:24.320
Hey, if you want us to keep doing this goddamn show,

29:24.320 --> 29:26.400
you're going to have to get up in the Max Fund Drive.

29:27.120 --> 29:35.920
It is our annual fundraiser to help collect money for the maximum fun podcast network,

29:35.920 --> 29:39.040
of which we are a proud, proud member.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.480
This is our third Max Fund Drive.

29:40.480 --> 29:44.400
I'm sure that most of you know the score, especially if you listened last week.

29:44.400 --> 29:51.360
If you don't, we are raising money for Max Fund Drive, for the maximum fund network.

29:51.360 --> 29:57.520
We get paid, I think it's safe to say, I know you guys are uncomfortable talking about finances.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.880
We make bank!

29:58.880 --> 30:03.920
We make bank, we get that sticky green, is that weed or money?

30:03.920 --> 30:04.480
It's both.

30:04.480 --> 30:08.880
We get the money and we spend it on weed and that money comes from you.

30:08.880 --> 30:12.240
We're a donor supported network, which is amazing.

30:12.240 --> 30:18.720
Jesse Thorn wrote up a big essay about why it is a donor supported network and it's moving.

30:18.720 --> 30:20.560
So go look that up and find it.

30:21.520 --> 30:26.640
But yeah, we have, we collect monthly donations at a number of different levels.

30:26.640 --> 30:30.800
There's something for whatever price point you can work with.

30:30.800 --> 30:35.520
We have a $10 donation level, $20, $35, all the way up to $200.

30:36.800 --> 30:43.200
For doing that, you not only support us and help grow the show and help bring new shows to the Max

30:43.200 --> 30:49.520
Fund Network, which this past year we've seen crazy expansion with RISK and the Memory Palace

30:49.520 --> 30:56.640
and Wham Bam Pow and what up, God, One Bad Mother just opened up, Dave Hill's podcasting incident.

30:56.640 --> 31:04.720
It's like we've doubled the network this year and every show is just delightful.

31:04.720 --> 31:10.000
There's really no collection of media anywhere else on internet or otherwise.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.120
But anyway, you help support us. You also get some pretty dope gifts.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.520
Justin, you want to break some of those down for us?

31:15.520 --> 31:19.520
So if you give us $10 a month, that is super generous of you.

31:19.520 --> 31:25.520
And to say thank you, we are going to send you some very cool Maximum Fun earbuds.

31:25.520 --> 31:29.920
They are branded with our distinctive Rocketship logo and they are fresh to death.

31:30.960 --> 31:34.400
You're also going to get a ton of, how many hours?

31:34.400 --> 31:36.960
We figured it up, like it was like 30 something.

31:36.960 --> 31:40.800
Like 30 some hours of donor exclusive material.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.880
Yeah, every year we do a bonus episode.

31:42.880 --> 31:44.480
So does every other podcast.

31:44.480 --> 31:48.720
So based on how many years they've been, like this is our third year, we have three bonus episodes.

31:49.600 --> 31:53.440
Plus the episode that we did for Max Fund Day in October.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.720
Oh shit, that's right.

31:54.720 --> 31:58.640
Yeah, and one of those episodes contains Papa McElroy.

31:58.640 --> 31:59.200
Our daddy.

31:59.200 --> 31:59.840
It's hilarious.

31:59.840 --> 32:03.520
So if you have been wanting to hear from whence we came,

32:03.520 --> 32:09.840
And if you're a previous donor, like the physical gifts are for people who are new donors or people who upgrade.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.960
You can find all this information on MaximumFun.org forward slash donate by the way.

32:12.960 --> 32:17.360
But if you're a previous donor, you get all that bonus shit, like regardless.

32:17.360 --> 32:20.480
For $20 a month, we're going to give you the Intimate Sensations pack.

32:21.600 --> 32:26.320
That is definitely, definitely, definitely a box of sex stuff.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.360
There's a black sexy mask.

32:27.360 --> 32:29.600
For our freaky listeners, you know you love it.

32:29.600 --> 32:40.960
The Velvafil Massager, Rocket Lube, which is Maximum Fun Sex Lube, which I would not, I would not recommend opening for collector's value.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.080
You're going to want to sell that.

32:42.080 --> 32:45.200
Well, but good luck existing it when you're trying to fuck a dry butt.

32:45.200 --> 32:48.400
And then you look over and you're like, I got the solution right here.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.800
I have the ungent that I need to perform this.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.800
And to be...

32:52.800 --> 32:55.120
Or a dry vagina or a dry vagina.

32:55.120 --> 32:55.840
Sorry, go ahead.

32:55.840 --> 32:59.840
Travis, I just to make it clear, that's from our friends, the Extreme Restraints.

32:59.840 --> 33:10.080
Like not only our biggest supporters, but we didn't just take a Gatorade bottle and just put some, put like a mixture of olive oil and bathwater into it.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.200
Like it's legit.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.160
It's legit lube.

33:12.160 --> 33:15.360
It's going to help you fuck a butt or a vagina.

33:15.360 --> 33:23.040
At $35, you're going to get all that stuff plus a pair of rocket engraved rocks glasses, which I would not recommend.

33:23.040 --> 33:28.240
These are, these are some sharp glasses.

33:28.240 --> 33:28.880
Well, they're not sharp.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.200
You're not going to like cut your mouth to the touch.

33:31.200 --> 33:31.680
They're smooth.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.520
They've got a thick, heavy bottom.

33:33.520 --> 33:36.400
You can pour just like spirits in it.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.320
Just like Travis got a thick ass.

33:40.160 --> 33:43.520
You pour, you pour your spirits in this and you have a good time with friends.

33:43.520 --> 33:44.240
There's two of them.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.080
So you can have maybe an intimate date.

33:46.080 --> 33:50.880
Maybe you fill it with rocket lube and then you pour the rocket lube from the glass into a dry butt.

33:50.880 --> 33:59.840
Maybe you pour it into your own butt because like, maybe you're at like a festival and it's like, it's really dry down there or it gets really swampy.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.440
We'll pour a little lube in there.

34:01.440 --> 34:02.400
It'll fix you right up.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.160
Maybe your window is a little...

34:04.160 --> 34:08.000
Also, if you, if you massage the lube into a bald man's head, his hair will grow back.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.240
His hair will grow back because you got streaks on your windows.

34:10.240 --> 34:14.160
Just throw some lube on it and then wipe it down and then shove it in your ass.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.320
The window?

34:16.320 --> 34:21.040
The whole window, the whole fixture right in there.

34:21.040 --> 34:21.760
You know what they say?

34:22.480 --> 34:27.440
A man's way to his heart is the window to the soul, which is his asshole with an actual window in it.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.920
So I guess, so do that.

34:32.720 --> 34:36.400
It's maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

34:37.040 --> 34:39.280
Please do this right now while you're thinking about it.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.400
You'll forget later.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.160
Go do it right this second.

34:42.160 --> 34:45.760
We can, we will be here waiting for you when you get back.

34:45.760 --> 34:49.840
Or if you have a computer handy, just go ahead and do it.

34:49.840 --> 34:53.520
We are, we are almost halfway.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.640
We have a goal of a thousand new donors, which is the goal we have every year.

34:56.640 --> 35:00.160
We don't have a thermoboner this year to track it, which is horseshit.

35:00.160 --> 35:03.200
Typically Jesse Thorn draws up a thermometer to keep track of it,

35:03.200 --> 35:07.600
but because he's got a boner addled mind, it always ends up looking like a boner.

35:07.600 --> 35:08.880
Not this year, not this year.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.520
We got some sort of HTML5 thing, which is...

35:12.080 --> 35:12.800
It's horseshit.

35:12.800 --> 35:13.440
It's horseshit.

35:13.440 --> 35:18.400
But we're on track, we still need everybody's help to get there.

35:19.120 --> 35:21.520
And we also have challenge donors who, every time we get a new donor,

35:21.520 --> 35:23.200
they donate a certain amount of money, which is...

35:23.760 --> 35:24.880
Does anybody know where it's at?

35:24.880 --> 35:27.040
It was over six bucks last time, which is...

35:27.040 --> 35:29.840
If we hit the goal of a thousand donors, it's like a lot of money.

35:29.840 --> 35:32.000
Oh God, please gimme.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.680
And I also want to say, lest we forget, lest we forget,

35:35.680 --> 35:39.840
if you are a Max Fund donor from the past, we are so grateful for you.

35:39.840 --> 35:43.520
I know that sometimes we hit the new Max Fund drive and it seems like

35:43.520 --> 35:46.480
we're so excited about new donors and we're trying to get new people.

35:46.480 --> 35:53.120
But if you've been a donor with us for a while, you are what makes this station happen.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.280
Somebody pointed out to me on Twitter, they were like,

35:56.560 --> 35:58.160
I'm uncomfortable with doing a monthly donation

35:58.160 --> 36:02.960
because it's the same amount of Netflix or other services like that.

36:02.960 --> 36:06.960
And the fact that there are people out there that feel like

36:06.960 --> 36:08.800
they get the same amount of entertainment from us

36:08.800 --> 36:10.000
and the other shows on the Max Fund Network

36:10.000 --> 36:13.600
that they do from quote unquote professional services like that

36:13.600 --> 36:17.440
and are willing to support us with the same amount of money,

36:17.440 --> 36:18.960
that's fucking amazing to me.

36:18.960 --> 36:22.960
And I'm not saying that they are mistaken in saying that

36:22.960 --> 36:26.160
because I get literally a dozen hours of entertainment

36:26.160 --> 36:27.520
for the Max Fund Network every week.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.240
But I don't know, it's incredibly, incredibly flattering.

36:32.240 --> 36:33.840
I never thought that guaranteed it would support us like that.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.760
Netflix does not love you as much as we love you.

36:35.760 --> 36:39.040
No, Netflix is fucking shitty, they send you broken disks

36:39.040 --> 36:41.040
and you don't realize it until you put it in your Xbox

36:41.040 --> 36:42.480
and it's just shrapnel in there.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.560
I also hear they fart in every-

36:44.560 --> 36:48.480
They fart on every, here's the thing though, it's only certain movies.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.800
So like if you get Hope Floats, that's a farter.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.560
If you get Serendipity, that's a farter.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.720
If you get The Lake House, that's a farter.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.880
Why is it all like romantic comedies?

36:58.880 --> 37:00.480
It's all romantic comedies.

37:00.480 --> 37:03.760
If it has John Cusack in it and he kisses a woman at the end,

37:03.760 --> 37:05.840
then don't touch the disk with your bare hands.

37:05.840 --> 37:06.400
That's all I'm saying.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.000
Except for Must Love Dogs, Must Love Dogs is safe.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.400
Except for Must Love Dogs, that's the only fart-free one.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.240
Because it is made of farts.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.880
Because it is a literal, oh man.

37:14.880 --> 37:17.200
Maximumfun.org for size donate is the link.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.840
Click it and just think about it, think about your options.

37:19.840 --> 37:24.160
I'm in a rock band and may or may not be attempting to climb a stardom.

37:24.160 --> 37:28.960
We've written a handful of songs and started playing them at a local karaoke.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.040
Sorry, that word is not in this question.

37:31.040 --> 37:37.280
I'm playing out at local venues and said horse shows.

37:37.280 --> 37:40.400
No, house shows, not horse shows.

37:41.360 --> 37:46.960
My problem is that after every set whenever someone attempts to compliment me on our music,

37:46.960 --> 37:50.880
I have an overwhelming urge to ask them questions about the songs,

37:50.880 --> 37:54.080
about my playing, about literally anything I can think of.

37:55.040 --> 37:58.000
So my question is this, how far can I go with this?

37:58.000 --> 38:02.240
Should I ask a question at all or just nod and thank them?

38:02.240 --> 38:05.520
And that's from Noteless in New Jersey.

38:05.520 --> 38:12.320
Guys, this reason, this question is, this is not a joke,

38:12.320 --> 38:14.800
literally the reason I had to stop doing community theater.

38:16.240 --> 38:16.560
Really?

38:16.560 --> 38:21.680
Because coming off, there's no, whether you're in the audience or coming off the stage,

38:21.680 --> 38:28.160
coming off the stage, that 15 minute period afterwards where people have to come up to you

38:28.160 --> 38:34.800
and tell you how sweet your voice is or you have to tell them how you were moved and touched

38:34.800 --> 38:37.760
by this particular performance of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat

38:38.320 --> 38:42.880
is like the worst human interaction I think that you can be party to.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.560
Yeah, and if I may, Noteless, here's the problem.

38:46.560 --> 38:50.240
No matter what you ask them, you're not going to believe their response.

38:50.240 --> 38:50.880
No.

38:50.880 --> 38:52.320
Everyone's lying.

38:52.320 --> 38:54.800
Yeah, and if you say like, hey, so what'd you think?

38:54.800 --> 38:56.320
And they're like, man, it was so good.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.160
And you're like, no, really, honestly, what did you think?

38:58.160 --> 38:59.680
No, really, it was so good.

38:59.680 --> 39:02.080
I mean, okay, you can tell me like, cause we're trying to get better.

39:02.080 --> 39:02.960
No, it was so good.

39:02.960 --> 39:03.360
So good.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.600
You're like the early shins.

39:05.600 --> 39:06.880
I like it so much.

39:06.880 --> 39:10.800
There is no affirmation they can give you that you're going to go, oh, okay.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.560
Do you know what's going to be affirmation?

39:13.120 --> 39:16.400
When you get wet panties flung on stage at show.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.520
That's how you're going to know.

39:17.520 --> 39:18.560
And they have to be wet?

39:18.560 --> 39:19.600
Why do they have to be wet?

39:19.600 --> 39:20.960
I don't know.

39:20.960 --> 39:21.680
Why are these wet?

39:21.680 --> 39:24.000
Hey, who threw these wet panties up on the stage?

39:24.800 --> 39:26.640
That's gross.

39:26.640 --> 39:29.120
I think they have to be wet for aerodynamic purposes.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.400
I don't think you're going to cut one.

39:30.400 --> 39:31.280
That's true.

39:31.280 --> 39:31.760
Yeah, it's like.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.240
Oh no, if they're dry, there's not enough mass to them.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.040
They won't fall.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.320
Inertia, you need the mass.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.200
Yeah, you need inertia.

39:39.120 --> 39:43.440
That's like the Foo Fighters had to ask people to stop throwing Mentos at them when they

39:43.440 --> 39:47.440
played Big Me because they are hard.

39:47.440 --> 39:48.640
Yeah, they're like little bullets.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.600
Little minty bullets.

39:49.600 --> 39:50.320
Please don't do that.

39:51.520 --> 39:56.000
You're never going to get an honesty from people who are there, presumably your friends,

39:56.000 --> 39:59.920
or even if they're not, like they're there, they're looking you dead in the eye.

39:59.920 --> 40:01.840
If you want honesty, get on the internet.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.120
Everyone will fucking hate you.

40:03.120 --> 40:06.080
The only reason that we're saying this, yes, thank you Justin.

40:06.080 --> 40:09.840
The only reason that we're saying this is because I have never said anything bad about

40:09.840 --> 40:13.440
any art anyone's ever done to their face.

40:13.440 --> 40:17.440
And I try not to say it on internet even because I know how nasty the internet gets.

40:17.440 --> 40:18.960
Oh boy, howdy, does it ever.

40:18.960 --> 40:20.800
Sheeminy creaminy.

40:20.800 --> 40:25.440
And you know the double-edged sword is like maybe, see, everybody also has that like one

40:25.440 --> 40:28.560
friend that's like their straight shooter friend that will be like, I'm going to give

40:28.560 --> 40:29.600
you my honest opinion.

40:29.600 --> 40:33.520
And you would think that in your mind, you're like, that's exactly what I want.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.840
I want an honest opinion so I can grow and improve.

40:35.840 --> 40:36.640
But you don't.

40:36.640 --> 40:40.240
You super don't because then Jerry's like, I don't know, man, it just sounded a little

40:40.240 --> 40:42.560
derivative of New Fugazi.

40:42.560 --> 40:43.520
Do they have new stuff?

40:44.320 --> 40:46.000
It sounds like New Fugazi to me.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.880
If Fugazi had continued to operate as a band in an alternate dimension, this sounds very

40:50.880 --> 40:51.360
derivative of that.

40:51.360 --> 40:52.480
This sounds derivative of that.

40:52.480 --> 40:55.680
Then you would say, well, Jerry, thank you for your honest opinion.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.840
And then in your bed at night at 4 a.m.

40:57.840 --> 41:01.680
because you can't fucking sleep, you're like, God damn it, Jerry, my whole life is in white.

41:01.680 --> 41:03.760
Why didn't you just fucking say it was good and walk away?

41:03.760 --> 41:04.880
Why'd you straight shoot me?

41:04.880 --> 41:06.400
Why'd you straight shoot me in the heart?

41:06.400 --> 41:11.440
That's why that's actually why people started bringing flowers to things because you could

41:11.440 --> 41:16.320
give someone flowers and then walk away and you don't have to say anything.

41:16.320 --> 41:20.320
And later they'll think, I must have talked to them because I have flowers here.

41:20.320 --> 41:21.040
Hey, take these.

41:21.040 --> 41:21.600
Oh, thank you.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.160
What do you think?

41:22.880 --> 41:24.640
I just fucking gave you flowers.

41:24.640 --> 41:27.280
Like, I shouldn't have to tell you that.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.400
The interaction's over.

41:28.400 --> 41:29.280
I went to Kroger.

41:29.280 --> 41:29.680
We're done.

41:29.680 --> 41:30.800
I went to Kroger.

41:30.800 --> 41:33.840
To be fair, you guys, I think you're letting your theater show because I don't think a lot

41:33.840 --> 41:36.400
of people roll up to rock shows with flowers.

41:37.440 --> 41:39.440
Maestro, maestro, one more.

41:39.440 --> 41:41.120
Maestro, maestro, one more.

41:41.120 --> 41:41.840
I say play on.

41:41.840 --> 41:43.840
Bravissimo, bravissimo.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.840
The flowers have to be wet though or else they won't travel.

41:51.120 --> 41:52.000
Don't do this.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.760
Just say, thank you so much.

41:53.760 --> 41:56.160
And we really appreciate you coming.

41:56.160 --> 41:56.960
Thank you so much.

41:56.960 --> 41:57.920
I really appreciate it.

41:57.920 --> 41:58.400
Did we?

41:58.400 --> 41:59.600
Because I mean, after our live shows-

41:59.600 --> 42:03.840
Can you imagine if we did a My Brother, My Brother, Me live show and someone came up

42:03.840 --> 42:05.920
afterwards and they were like, hey, that was funny.

42:05.920 --> 42:10.320
And I was like, go on, let's down.

42:10.880 --> 42:16.000
Tell me, are you physically exhausted from laughing?

42:18.560 --> 42:24.880
Yeah, I mean, we don't, like after our live shows, we usually just like fucking just like

42:24.880 --> 42:25.600
hang, right?

42:25.600 --> 42:28.320
Like we're almost ashamed of the shit that we just did and we don't want to talk about

42:28.320 --> 42:28.400
it.

42:28.400 --> 42:29.040
Let's move on.

42:30.240 --> 42:31.200
No, I'm not joking.

42:31.200 --> 42:35.520
That's typically like, after our first live show at Second City,

42:35.520 --> 42:36.480
we went out to that bar.

42:37.120 --> 42:40.400
It was my birthday and I don't remember a lot of it because fucking Rocky Horror got

42:40.400 --> 42:41.360
me blackout.

42:41.920 --> 42:45.840
But like, we all just drank and didn't talk about it, I feel like.

42:46.800 --> 42:47.840
Am I misremembering?

42:48.400 --> 42:48.960
No, you're right.

42:48.960 --> 42:49.440
No, I didn't.

42:49.440 --> 42:50.240
I didn't talk about it.

42:50.240 --> 42:51.600
I don't want to talk about it.

42:51.600 --> 42:52.080
That's the thing.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.280
I don't want to talk about it now.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.560
We're talking a big game, but like-

42:55.120 --> 42:58.640
That's actually the worst part about this is getting so stupid.

42:58.640 --> 43:05.760
But like, when we do a live show and then we talk to people afterwards, I really like

43:07.360 --> 43:13.440
being in any way like entertaining or worth listening to, I don't know if this is this

43:13.440 --> 43:18.400
way for genuinely talented people, but for me is a finite resource.

43:18.400 --> 43:18.800
Yeah.

43:18.800 --> 43:23.280
I put it all into like an hour of doing a live show afterwards.

43:23.280 --> 43:26.080
Like, I know I suck.

43:26.080 --> 43:27.600
Like, I am not funny.

43:27.600 --> 43:33.760
I do not have any, whatever neurons those are that connect me to saying like, not even

43:33.760 --> 43:36.720
funny, like applicable, like even relevant.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.240
You fried all of those connections.

43:38.240 --> 43:42.720
You can chart that between, so our Chicago live show where we did like 20 minutes and

43:42.720 --> 43:44.720
then we're like, what's up?

43:44.720 --> 43:45.840
Oh, this guy.

43:45.840 --> 43:50.640
And then our Austin live show when we did two back to back hour long episodes and went

43:50.640 --> 43:53.200
out for like five and a half minutes and we're like, uh.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.760
And fell asleep on the tables in the back of that monk's place.

43:55.760 --> 43:57.440
Do you have a Yahoo?

43:57.440 --> 43:58.160
I have a few.

43:58.160 --> 44:01.360
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Reed.

44:01.360 --> 44:02.000
Thank you, Reed.

44:03.440 --> 44:07.040
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Miomi, who asks, well, I quitted karate.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.080
Is that a good decision?

44:10.080 --> 44:10.960
Trainings are hard.

44:10.960 --> 44:12.160
My bro told me to quit.

44:12.160 --> 44:12.960
Oh, Jesus.

44:12.960 --> 44:13.840
Trainings are hard.

44:13.840 --> 44:17.440
My bro told me to quit because I didn't want to attend karate, so I quitted.

44:18.160 --> 44:20.320
My parents don't.

44:20.320 --> 44:22.640
Hey, did you, were you found guilty for karate?

44:22.640 --> 44:23.440
No, I was acquitted.

44:23.440 --> 44:29.920
My parents don't want me to quit because they wanted me to protect myself when I grow older.

44:29.920 --> 44:31.920
So is it a good or bad decision to quit?

44:33.920 --> 44:35.120
There's so many factors here.

44:35.120 --> 44:41.520
Do you guys know anybody who did karate coming up?

44:42.480 --> 44:43.440
Yes, I do.

44:43.440 --> 44:44.000
I knew one.

44:44.880 --> 44:45.600
Chris Sizemore?

44:46.400 --> 44:46.960
Derek Moore.

44:47.680 --> 44:50.000
But like, here's the thing.

44:50.000 --> 44:56.160
I feel like there was a mythos around karate or all forms of kung fu, and there still is,

44:56.160 --> 44:58.400
which is I'm learning it for self-defense.

44:58.400 --> 45:05.040
I don't think that situation has ever unfolded organically in the history of pugilism.

45:05.600 --> 45:12.320
I think that somebody who has dedicated 20 years of their life to mastering kung fu,

45:13.040 --> 45:18.320
and then they get in one bar fight, in that bar fight, in that moment, that primal moment

45:18.320 --> 45:22.080
of punch, they do not go, what did my sensei teach me?

45:23.120 --> 45:26.640
See, I disagree, because I think in the moment of punch, it probably comes up,

45:26.640 --> 45:31.120
but like in the dark alley where a dude like pulls a gun, you're probably not thinking like,

45:31.120 --> 45:31.680
I want to karate.

45:31.680 --> 45:36.160
Well, no, because you're not going to fucking like throw a ball of chi at him.

45:36.160 --> 45:37.920
Like that's obviously not going to work.

45:37.920 --> 45:39.120
Have you guys seen that thing though?

45:39.120 --> 45:43.520
When you're fucking, when you're careening towards that drunk truck driver,

45:43.520 --> 45:46.240
you're not going to kung fu his car out of the way, Travis.

45:46.240 --> 45:51.840
When this, when the fucking sun explodes and we experience the heat death of the universe,

45:51.840 --> 45:53.680
you're not going to fucking kick your way out of that one.

45:53.680 --> 45:56.640
Can I tell you the funny thing is though, as soon as someone says like self-defense,

45:56.640 --> 45:59.600
I'm taking it for self-defense, that is what I picture like fighting off.

45:59.600 --> 46:03.600
I'm 95 years old and this coronary is about to get me, but let me just chop it.

46:04.880 --> 46:05.360
Done.

46:05.360 --> 46:05.840
Fixed it.

46:06.960 --> 46:07.920
Fixed it with a chop.

46:07.920 --> 46:08.720
It's cool now.

46:08.720 --> 46:09.760
Got it with a chop.

46:09.760 --> 46:11.360
90 years of kung fu paid off.

46:11.360 --> 46:17.760
Yeah, people say they do it to defend themselves and if you really pound that math out,

46:18.480 --> 46:22.720
it is a bad investment no matter which way it breaks.

46:22.720 --> 46:23.280
Inconceivable.

46:23.280 --> 46:27.600
In this situation, in this situation that you're, that you're envisioning,

46:28.160 --> 46:33.760
you're in mano a mano combat, hand to hand, no weapons allowed.

46:33.760 --> 46:40.000
Because make no mistake, my friend, if you have karate and he has insert sharp thing here,

46:40.000 --> 46:40.960
you lose.

46:40.960 --> 46:41.600
You lose.

46:41.600 --> 46:42.480
It's over.

46:42.480 --> 46:43.680
You get stabbed.

46:43.680 --> 46:48.240
That's why, that's why fucking knives and swords and guns were invented is because people

46:48.240 --> 46:51.680
like this fuck hole on yahoo is like karate is too hard.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.200
I wish there was a substitute.

46:53.200 --> 46:58.320
Oh, you're telling me this knife is worth a hundred billion years of karate.

46:58.320 --> 46:59.840
Okay, I'll just take that then.

46:59.840 --> 47:00.960
It's way easier.

47:00.960 --> 47:03.440
Yeah, how about just bring some mace with you?

47:03.440 --> 47:06.160
Because what you're talking about is four hours a week, right?

47:06.160 --> 47:12.800
Yeah, like an hour a week for a month, something like 50 hours a year of karate.

47:12.800 --> 47:14.240
You just pulled all that out of your butt.

47:15.120 --> 47:15.520
Why?

47:15.520 --> 47:16.160
That's nothing wrong.

47:16.160 --> 47:18.000
Based on the latest statistics.

47:18.000 --> 47:18.560
The latest statistics.

47:18.560 --> 47:27.120
Hours a year of karate training versus like the one opportunity you may ever have to just

47:27.120 --> 47:31.040
not get your ass beat as bad as your ass would have gotten beaten.

47:31.040 --> 47:35.520
Also with those karate classes, from what I know from watching movies and TV shows,

47:35.520 --> 47:37.360
you get your ass beat a lot.

47:37.360 --> 47:41.680
You get thrown around and people beat the shit out of you.

47:41.680 --> 47:43.520
Right now, I've never been in a fight in my life.

47:43.520 --> 47:46.320
I feel like I've talked about this in the podcast before, and I'm afraid that first

47:46.320 --> 47:47.440
punch I'd be done.

47:47.440 --> 47:51.040
So maybe being in kung fu classes gets the shit beaten out of you, so you're a little

47:51.040 --> 47:52.880
bit more used to getting the shit beaten out of you.

47:52.880 --> 47:54.240
But at the same time, it seems so...

47:55.600 --> 47:59.280
I say this, but I watch Tony Jaa and he's on some next level shit.

47:59.280 --> 48:02.640
I think that if he got embroiled, he would come out the victor.

48:02.640 --> 48:07.680
But I guarantee he's not going to master Tony's, you know, Taekwondo class.

48:07.680 --> 48:12.640
Right, because that shit, you're like outside a bar and a dude is drunk and coming after

48:12.640 --> 48:12.960
you.

48:12.960 --> 48:15.520
You're not going to be like, so are you doing crane style or Taekwondo?

48:15.520 --> 48:16.080
Oh, fuck.

48:17.440 --> 48:23.440
And right now, I know there are dozens of people that are shouting at their iPods saying,

48:23.440 --> 48:28.560
I don't do martial arts for self-defense.

48:28.560 --> 48:31.600
I do it for mental clarity and physical exercise.

48:31.600 --> 48:33.200
And newsflash.

48:33.200 --> 48:34.960
I can kick all your asses.

48:34.960 --> 48:36.000
If you are in a bar...

48:36.000 --> 48:36.880
Blanket statement.

48:36.880 --> 48:39.280
If you see me, fucking bring it.

48:39.280 --> 48:40.720
I will take you to clown town.

48:41.600 --> 48:42.240
Go ahead, Justin.

48:42.880 --> 48:43.760
Oh, thanks.

48:45.120 --> 48:45.920
There's a fight.

48:46.720 --> 48:48.880
They are looking to you.

48:48.880 --> 48:50.080
You are the guy.

48:50.080 --> 48:53.040
You cannot use the excuse of, no, I just do martial...

48:53.040 --> 48:53.600
No, no, no.

48:54.240 --> 48:59.760
They're going to look to you, Kung Fu Kim or whatever your name is, to fight this fight

48:59.760 --> 49:00.160
for them.

49:00.160 --> 49:01.120
Mm-hmm.

49:01.120 --> 49:03.920
You're setting up unrealistic expectations, is what I'm saying.

49:04.720 --> 49:05.680
And I will say this, too.

49:06.320 --> 49:07.680
I mean, counterpoint.

49:08.480 --> 49:12.560
If I were about to fight a dude in a bar and somebody else in the bar was like, you know,

49:12.560 --> 49:14.080
he's a black belt, right?

49:14.080 --> 49:15.280
I would run away.

49:16.160 --> 49:17.120
It is good for that.

49:17.120 --> 49:18.160
It is good for intimidation.

49:18.160 --> 49:18.960
It's intimidation.

49:18.960 --> 49:19.120
But...

49:19.120 --> 49:20.560
I would totally leave the situation.

49:20.560 --> 49:27.760
Is there such a thing as a dojo run by like a drunk dock worker?

49:27.760 --> 49:31.920
Yeah, I have a judge you could try, it's called all of them.

49:36.480 --> 49:43.360
If there was an illegal boxing gambling ring run by a drunk dock worker, that is the kind

49:43.360 --> 49:44.720
of shit that I would be on.

49:45.440 --> 49:46.160
You know what I mean?

49:46.160 --> 49:50.400
Yeah, like where's the dojo that like teaches you to like punch sides of beef?

49:50.400 --> 49:56.320
I'm a Miller's High Life belt at my dojo, and it's just a belt, just like a regular

49:56.320 --> 49:58.240
belt with a Miller's High Life label stuck on it.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.920
But it's the next to highest one you can get.

49:59.920 --> 50:00.640
It's the champagne.

50:00.640 --> 50:01.360
You know what?

50:01.360 --> 50:04.240
I would go to a dojo run by like Norman Reedus.

50:05.040 --> 50:06.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:06.560 --> 50:09.600
I wouldn't be in that kind of fighting.

50:09.600 --> 50:13.200
He kind of is like a drunk, the drunk dock worker of actors though.

50:13.200 --> 50:13.440
Right?

50:13.440 --> 50:28.640
Like, I think that the big problem with karate is I don't have an end of the sentence.

50:28.640 --> 50:30.960
It keeps taking our jobs is the issue.

50:31.520 --> 50:32.080
Sure.

50:32.080 --> 50:34.320
Something, something, whatever.

50:35.440 --> 50:37.120
Let's ask, let's answer a real question.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.400
Nobody does kung fu anymore.

50:38.960 --> 50:40.400
Nobody's ever done kung fu again.

50:40.400 --> 50:42.480
I'm sorry if we hurt your feelings and you do kung fu.

50:42.480 --> 50:45.520
Now, that's some shit.

50:45.520 --> 50:46.160
That's some shit.

50:46.160 --> 50:48.160
I can crowd McGraw or Tim McGraw.

50:50.400 --> 50:53.600
Welcome to Tom, welcome to Tim McGraw's crowd McGraw.

50:54.320 --> 50:57.520
I'll teach you how to tumble, how to throw somebody, use their weight against them and

50:57.520 --> 50:59.280
not get your head knocked off.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.760
Welcome to Tom McGraw's Tim McGraw crowd McGraw.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.200
Hi, I'm Tom McGraw.

51:03.200 --> 51:06.080
People tell me I look like Tim McGraw, but that's just because my name sounds the same.

51:06.080 --> 51:07.600
Who wants to learn how to tussle?

51:07.600 --> 51:12.160
My brother Tim McGraw taught me his fighting style of crowd McGraw that he invented.

51:12.160 --> 51:13.680
I miss him every day.

51:13.680 --> 51:15.280
I miss him so much.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.240
I miss him.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.160
He died in a crowd McGraw accident.

51:18.880 --> 51:21.680
I've been pretending to be him for the last 20 years.

51:22.640 --> 51:24.080
Have you had sex with Faith Hill?

51:24.080 --> 51:24.640
No?

51:24.640 --> 51:26.160
Well, come on, let's crowd McGraw.

51:29.680 --> 51:32.800
Everybody do in the crowd McGraw crowd.

51:32.800 --> 51:33.920
I don't think that was Tim McGraw.

51:33.920 --> 51:34.880
I don't think that was Tim McGraw.

51:34.880 --> 51:36.160
Everybody crowd McGraw.

51:36.160 --> 51:37.840
I don't think that was Tim McGraw.

51:37.840 --> 51:38.720
Everybody crowd McGraw like you were dying.

51:38.720 --> 51:39.680
Let's go.

51:39.680 --> 51:40.160
That one.

51:40.160 --> 51:40.800
That one works.

51:41.440 --> 51:42.000
Thank you.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.560
Don't take the crowd McGraw lessons from my brother Tom.

51:47.760 --> 51:49.600
Don't take his shit.

51:49.600 --> 51:50.560
Don't take his shit.

51:50.560 --> 51:51.520
Crowd McGraw him.

51:53.440 --> 51:54.640
I mean, oh my God.

51:56.240 --> 51:57.760
I'm an Indian crowd McGraw.

51:58.480 --> 52:00.640
I'm Cherokee and Choctaw.

52:00.640 --> 52:02.000
I'll flip you over my shoulder.

52:02.000 --> 52:11.040
Can anyone give me an I like it I love it?

52:12.240 --> 52:13.200
I like it.

52:13.200 --> 52:14.000
I love it.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.760
I chopped that guy's arm off.

52:18.080 --> 52:19.520
All right, let's answer a question.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.640
I love my boyfriend of a year.

52:22.640 --> 52:26.320
Oh man, guys, I got to start reading these before I start reading them.

52:26.320 --> 52:27.440
Got to do a little prep.

52:27.440 --> 52:28.480
A little pre pro.

52:28.480 --> 52:31.280
I love my boyfriend of over a year very much.

52:31.280 --> 52:34.080
However, something's been bothering me lately.

52:34.080 --> 52:37.680
Whenever I need to vent to him about a hard day or someone I don't like,

52:37.680 --> 52:40.160
he always feels the need to play devil's advocate,

52:40.160 --> 52:43.600
telling me they have a point or that I shouldn't have done something

52:43.600 --> 52:46.640
when all I really wanted was to get it off my chest.

52:46.640 --> 52:49.280
I know not everything that bothers me is entirely reasonable,

52:49.280 --> 52:50.640
but sometimes I just need to hear.

52:51.280 --> 52:53.120
I just need to hear what I want to hear.

52:53.760 --> 52:55.200
What should I tell him?

52:55.200 --> 52:55.760
Thanks.

52:55.760 --> 52:57.840
That's from can't vent in Kentucky.

52:57.840 --> 53:01.760
It sounds like this dude's first time being a boyfriend.

53:01.760 --> 53:07.120
It sounds like his first significant other of any gender.

53:08.080 --> 53:11.280
It might also be his first time trying to be like a good boyfriend.

53:12.080 --> 53:12.400
What do you mean?

53:12.400 --> 53:14.800
It might be possible that he's been an SO before.

53:15.520 --> 53:16.800
And was just a shithead?

53:17.360 --> 53:19.360
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

53:19.360 --> 53:20.400
I'm bad at this too.

53:21.200 --> 53:23.200
Like I completely relate to this dude.

53:23.200 --> 53:27.840
Oh, this is so awful to tell you how horrible I am at reading human emotions.

53:27.840 --> 53:29.920
I actually have taken the shorthand.

53:29.920 --> 53:32.240
And like when Teresa will start to vent about something,

53:32.240 --> 53:33.600
I will literally say,

53:33.600 --> 53:37.280
do you want me to be supportive boyfriend or devil's advocate boyfriend?

53:37.280 --> 53:38.160
There is litter.

53:38.160 --> 53:41.200
I do the exact same thing and maybe that's cheating.

53:41.200 --> 53:44.320
I don't know, but it seems to work better than guessing.

53:44.320 --> 53:47.120
Yeah, it is cheating because like I don't do that.

53:47.120 --> 53:50.400
I have to just read, you know, read the room, read the variables.

53:50.400 --> 53:53.440
Is she perioding, right fellas?

53:54.160 --> 53:54.720
High five.

53:56.320 --> 53:56.960
Skype five.

53:57.600 --> 53:58.080
Why five?

53:59.360 --> 54:00.320
I like that.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.280
That's a good one.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.840
No, I mean, I don't know what to say.

54:03.840 --> 54:07.120
Sometimes you just want to say something out loud

54:07.120 --> 54:09.200
and you don't necessarily want an argument about it.

54:09.200 --> 54:12.320
You just want to be angry for a while.

54:12.320 --> 54:16.240
There was a moment last night where Teresa was telling me a story about something

54:16.240 --> 54:20.080
and I was just staring at her waiting for her to like ask for my opinion

54:20.080 --> 54:22.000
or ask for me like what to do.

54:22.000 --> 54:25.920
And she finished the sentence and didn't have anything else to say.

54:25.920 --> 54:27.280
And I was just staring at her.

54:29.280 --> 54:31.200
She's like, and I'm really upset about that.

54:31.200 --> 54:32.880
And I was like, oh yeah, no, that's shitty.

54:32.880 --> 54:33.440
That's awful.

54:35.040 --> 54:36.560
Were you, honestly time,

54:37.200 --> 54:40.960
were you listening to the completeness of the thought?

54:41.920 --> 54:43.120
It was one of two things.

54:43.120 --> 54:46.800
I was either so deep in it that I couldn't see the light to get out

54:47.360 --> 54:49.760
or I was thinking about like pizza.

54:49.760 --> 54:55.440
You were pondering an earlier phrase that she said.

54:55.440 --> 54:59.520
You were so busy processing that that you didn't hear the punchline.

55:00.400 --> 55:01.200
That might be true.

55:01.200 --> 55:03.760
You didn't, you were so stuck on the descending action.

55:03.760 --> 55:09.360
It is really hard to shake the impulse to fix.

55:10.080 --> 55:14.960
And I think that that's something that I've always struggled with in my relationships

55:14.960 --> 55:22.880
that I never have, and I think Sydney is the first relationship I've been in

55:22.880 --> 55:28.000
where like I finally, because of just her telling me what I'm doing wrong

55:28.000 --> 55:30.160
and me sort of realizing it on my own and growing up,

55:30.160 --> 55:35.360
like it seems like a very healthy impulse to like want to fix everything.

55:35.360 --> 55:40.400
But man, that can, you can get into a bad situation very fast.

55:40.400 --> 55:42.480
The issue is like, I'm always that guy.

55:42.480 --> 55:45.040
I am always like, well, let me find a way to help you.

55:45.040 --> 55:48.320
And so the way that it breaks down for me, again, let me preface,

55:48.320 --> 55:51.280
I'm awful at this, is I have a two-step process.

55:51.280 --> 55:56.080
And the first step is, is there anything I can do directly to fix this?

55:56.080 --> 55:58.640
To which the answer is almost always no.

55:59.680 --> 56:03.280
And then step two is, can you find a teacher or an adult?

56:04.720 --> 56:07.760
Can you find a teacher or an adult that can help you out with this problem?

56:07.760 --> 56:09.760
Because there's an adult out there somewhere that will help you,

56:09.760 --> 56:12.640
a parent or a teacher or a trusted close friend.

56:12.640 --> 56:16.640
Sydney has had problems, was having problems sleeping recently.

56:16.640 --> 56:22.960
And I tried to advise her with my vast amount of sleep knowledge.

56:23.840 --> 56:26.000
And then I realized that that didn't work.

56:26.000 --> 56:30.640
So I found out who the sleep doctor was at the hospital where she works

56:30.640 --> 56:33.600
and started insisting that she talked to him because he's an adult.

56:34.320 --> 56:36.320
That is what I'm saying. It's a foolproof method.

56:36.320 --> 56:37.920
I've gone through my entire checklist.

56:37.920 --> 56:39.360
I'm going to bump you up to an adult.

56:39.360 --> 56:42.080
Listen, I got to elevate, I got to escalate this.

56:42.080 --> 56:43.520
I really have nothing for you.

56:44.160 --> 56:46.320
I don't know any teachers anymore.

56:46.320 --> 56:47.440
They all fucking died.

56:49.360 --> 56:52.880
It's really unfortunate because you can't, I mean, it's frustrating.

56:52.880 --> 56:54.320
I get it from the guy's perspective.

56:54.320 --> 56:56.960
I mean, the devil's advocate thing, that's easy.

56:56.960 --> 56:59.360
Here's when people want you to be devil's advocate.

56:59.360 --> 57:00.320
A never.

57:00.320 --> 57:02.320
Like they don't ever want that.

57:02.320 --> 57:04.400
Trust me, they know what the flip side is.

57:04.400 --> 57:06.560
They don't need you to illuminate that for them.

57:06.560 --> 57:09.120
You can put your boyfriend on the line if you want.

57:09.120 --> 57:10.080
We can tell him that.

57:10.080 --> 57:12.080
It might not hurt to say like,

57:12.080 --> 57:14.000
I'm just going to vent for a second, but.

57:14.640 --> 57:15.920
But what if they need that truth?

57:15.920 --> 57:19.040
What if they're saying some bullshit

57:19.040 --> 57:21.760
and they need you to fucking grab them, pull them back down.

57:21.760 --> 57:23.200
Do you want to know the answer, Griffin?

57:23.200 --> 57:24.800
You don't do it.

57:24.800 --> 57:27.200
But what if they need it, Travis?

57:27.200 --> 57:28.160
This is what I'm saying.

57:28.720 --> 57:31.120
What if they need it and that's secretly what they want?

57:31.120 --> 57:33.040
Is somebody telling them no stop?

57:34.880 --> 57:35.360
They don't.

57:35.360 --> 57:36.400
Wait, what?

57:36.400 --> 57:37.840
Want someone to disagree with them?

57:37.840 --> 57:38.080
Yeah.

57:38.720 --> 57:39.040
Never.

57:39.600 --> 57:40.320
But what if they do?

57:40.320 --> 57:40.960
That's what I'm saying.

57:40.960 --> 57:42.240
They don't.

57:42.240 --> 57:42.960
But they don't.

57:42.960 --> 57:44.800
What if they don't want it, but they need it?

57:44.800 --> 57:46.240
Griffin, we're older than you.

57:46.240 --> 57:47.280
They don't.

57:47.280 --> 57:48.160
They don't.

57:48.160 --> 57:49.040
They never do.

57:49.680 --> 57:52.080
And I mean they as in all people.

57:52.080 --> 57:55.120
Not like women or men, all people.

57:55.120 --> 57:56.880
When I hear Sydney is wrong about something

57:56.880 --> 57:58.720
or she's angry at someone else,

57:58.720 --> 58:04.640
here is the extent to which that is not the J-Man's department.

58:04.640 --> 58:05.600
Do you call an adult?

58:05.600 --> 58:07.760
Do you call a teacher or an adult to come in and be like,

58:07.760 --> 58:10.640
hey, nope, wrong, wrong girl.

58:10.640 --> 58:12.240
I'm not getting into a fight with you

58:12.240 --> 58:13.840
because this does not have an effect.

58:13.840 --> 58:17.040
Justin called me in to tell you this, nope.

58:17.040 --> 58:19.920
Here's another piece of advice to the question asker.

58:20.960 --> 58:23.360
The time to discuss this with your boyfriend

58:23.360 --> 58:25.360
is not in the middle of this situation.

58:27.120 --> 58:27.760
Wait a minute.

58:29.120 --> 58:29.840
No.

58:29.840 --> 58:31.520
Who is going to start a conversation?

58:31.520 --> 58:32.640
No one does that.

58:32.640 --> 58:36.320
Hey, by the way, if I'm talking some bullshit anytime

58:36.320 --> 58:38.160
in the discernible future.

58:38.160 --> 58:40.560
No, what I'm saying is she, okay,

58:40.560 --> 58:42.560
so she's upset enough to feel they need to vent

58:43.280 --> 58:45.200
and then her boyfriend does something wrong.

58:45.760 --> 58:48.960
I guarantee she ain't going into it with a cool level head

58:48.960 --> 58:50.720
to be like, hey, honey, side note,

58:50.720 --> 58:52.640
let me explain to you what's going on right now

58:52.640 --> 58:53.920
and why I'm upset.

58:53.920 --> 58:55.520
Well, okay, that's fine.

58:55.520 --> 58:58.080
But the better thing is don't talk to him

58:58.080 --> 59:00.160
and just let him listen to this part

59:00.160 --> 59:03.040
and we'll tell him for you to not,

59:03.040 --> 59:04.720
because that way it won't seem aggressive.

59:04.720 --> 59:07.360
It's just like, hey, these zany brothers

59:07.360 --> 59:09.680
who sometimes talk about eggs for 20 minutes

59:09.680 --> 59:11.040
have a special message.

59:11.040 --> 59:13.200
It was like 10, but also-

59:13.200 --> 59:15.440
To be fair, Justin was adding in the 10 minutes

59:15.440 --> 59:16.720
that we'll talk about eggs later.

59:19.040 --> 59:21.280
It's just not worth, like, it's not a fight.

59:21.280 --> 59:23.760
It's not a, you get no prize

59:23.760 --> 59:26.240
for being righter than the other person or-

59:26.240 --> 59:28.800
Because it very easily turns into you

59:28.800 --> 59:31.520
shouldering the burden of the person they're mad at.

59:31.520 --> 59:33.600
And that's what love is.

59:34.400 --> 59:35.520
That's what you do.

59:36.160 --> 59:37.440
How do you guys not get this?

59:38.000 --> 59:39.680
Whoever you're defending

59:39.680 --> 59:43.200
will never, ever, ever, ever, ever

59:43.200 --> 59:46.800
make you some coffee or give you a foot rub

59:46.800 --> 59:48.480
or drive you to the airport.

59:48.480 --> 59:49.760
It does not matter.

59:49.760 --> 59:52.960
They lost the chance for you to be on their side

59:52.960 --> 59:54.880
when they were not at the altar

59:54.880 --> 59:57.120
or at the boyfriend vault with you.

59:57.120 --> 59:59.520
At the boyfriend store.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.040
They lost, they missed their chance

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.160
to have you on their team.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.960
What I'm saying is they're not gonna do those things

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:08.320
unless you go to them and tell them what you did for them.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.760
I asked it as your sur-

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.440
I was your second.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.120
I was your surrogate.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.160
I stood up for you.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.680
Rub my tootsies.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.760
You don't know me, Trisha's boss.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:20.960
But I, can you put Trisha's boss on the phone?

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.400
He needs to appreciate something.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.800
Listen, you're a grade A bitch

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.960
and my wife hates your guts.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.760
But I took that hate from you,

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.600
put it on myself and now I would love a foot rub.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.120
Hey, I'm going to Tucson next week.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.400
Can I get a ride to the airport?

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.360
That's all I'm asking.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.360
It's not asking a lot.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.400
Wow, she wasn't lying.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.280
You are a bitch.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.640
Can I have $7 then, please?

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.520
I just want $7.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:46.880
My relationship-

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.240
I'm also gonna need to move in with you

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.120
because she kicked me out.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.760
My relationship is permanently negatively impacted.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.440
All I need is one to the airport.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.000
I need $10 a month.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:56.640
Just, that's it.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.840
That's not asking so much.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:01.520
And in exchange, I'll give you some earbuds that I have.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.880
They have a rocket ship on them.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.040
You know, that's not asking a lot.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.560
Listen, I need $20 a month.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.400
If you give me $20 a month,

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.520
and this is probably overstepping our bounds,

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.720
but I'll give you some sex lube in a box.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.120
To be fair, if you're not cool with sex lube in a box,

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.480
I can also give you a t-shirt.

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.400
Yes, there's a substitute program.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.920
Are people, do you think people understand what we're doing?

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.600
No, it's covert.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.400
It's subliminal.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.360
It's superliminal.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.920
Maximum Fun Drive is here, of course, friends.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.560
And we so appreciate your support.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.800
We appreciate ExtremeRestraints.com

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:44.000
for their generous gift to help us make this drive the,

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.400
well, the weirdest of any drive going on right now.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.960
Let's talk about the upper echelons.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.080
Let's talk about the premium rush.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.960
I saw that movie, such great bike stunts,

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.120
such great acting from Mr. Gordon Levitt.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.400
Now, you do remember that we set that up

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.640
as a euphemism for being a douche, right?

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.320
Yep, I do remember that.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.680
So there are tears, premium tears,

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:18.080
which is what I cried after I watched Maximum Rush.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.200
Justin, tell us, tell us what people are gonna get.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.560
So we talked about 10, 20, 35.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.280
If you give us $100 a month,

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.520
you're gonna be one of Jesse's Golden Eagles.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.760
You're gonna get, join the Inner Circle,

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.600
which is a monthly club celebrating the best

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.960
in comedy, music, and culture.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.440
Hosts of the Max Fun programs will pick a favorite book,

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.680
movie, album, something else cool,

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.280
and you're just gonna get it

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.840
with a note about why you'll like it.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.800
You're also gonna get a free ticket

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.280
and you're also gonna get the Rocks Glasses,

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.360
the Intimate Sensations Pack, Max Fun earbuds,

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.680
and you're gonna be invited to the Max Fun Dinner in LA,

01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:00.720
which is before Max Fun Con, and we'll be there.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.000
Have a very special night.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.960
I went last year and hung out with Chuck Bryant

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.360
and John Hodgman and the guys from RiffTrax,

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.840
but I also got to hang out with Dimitri Pertnoy,

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.400
who is an awesome listener and a really cool guy.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.760
Really looking forward to hanging out with him

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.880
at Max Fun Con again.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:17.920
See, you could be that guy.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.000
He's a really awesome guy, yes.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.200
Two years, a year before that, Justin and I went

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.080
and got, Justin embarrassed me in front of John Hodgman.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.360
In the worst way possible.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.280
I still have a picture of it, if you ever wanna see it.

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.120
If you ever wanna see, maybe we can put that picture up.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.200
It's like a special thing in the forums

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.640
of when Justin made me the angriest

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:35.600
I've ever been at Justin.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.680
It was a special moment.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.720
It was not a special moment.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.640
It was the angriest I've ever, ever been.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.680
At anyone, probably.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.080
Well, we're past it now.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:44.800

for boatparty.biz.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:56.960
What is that, you ask?

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.720
You stupid idiot.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.600
How do you not know about this already?

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.120
It's a cruise.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.680
It's a comedy cruise.

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:08.800
You get on a ship from September 13th to 16th.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:11.760
You get on a ship and you get to do and experience comedy

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.000
with people like Maria Bamford and Chuck Bryant

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.560
and Dan Deacon and John Hodgman and Josie Long

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.120
and Al Magigal and Eugene Merman

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.520
and Marc Maron or Marc Maron.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.760
John Roderickson in the mix.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.360
I think it's Marc Mariner.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:26.800
Marc Mariner's in there.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.280
Yeah, sure.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.440
It's a maritime law that Marc Maron-

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.560
His son's Submariner.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.920
Kristen Schaal is gonna be there.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.040
Fuck.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.120
Fuck, why aren't we going to this?

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.800
It's so dope.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.600
It's so good and we can't go because we're not allowed.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.680
We're not allowed on the internet.

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.680
We're not allowed to go to anything, ever.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.560
Justin and Travis and I, before we were podcasters,

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.320
we were whale molesters.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.960
You let us anywhere within-

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.800
I'm only laughing because I feel so guilty.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.080
We would get 10,000 lees under the sea

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.480
and then we would get one leek inside a whale

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:04.880
and it would-

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.960
Guys, no shit.

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.960
It's the best feeling in the world.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.600
But we're not allowed to do it anymore.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.800
And the shame you feel afterwards.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.200
The shame you feel afterwards is the most pungent shame

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.160
you'll ever experience.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:16.800
But when you're-

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.480
When you're-

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.600
Oh my God.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.560
Sometimes I read the parable of Jonah and the whale

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.720
and it's like, I just can't control myself.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:29.920
I watch Pinocchio and I'm like, ow, Pieschio is more like it.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.480
I think I get on the forums and I read my Monstro slash fic.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.400
Monstro is the whale from Pinocchio.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.600
And I just can't help it.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:45.120
I get my rocket lube and I spend two and a half hours

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.240
right there on the web.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.760
Just reading it and keeping my hands moisturized with the lube

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.360
so that my knuckles don't get all cracky.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.280
I get- It's very dry in my office.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.320
Also, I masturbate.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.280
Maximumfun.org first slash donate.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.280
And then you can just donate.

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.200
If you donate, I will never talk about that shit

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.800
I just talked about ever again.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:09.840
That's a guarantee.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.240
It's not.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.480
And it is also important that when you donate,

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:15.200
that you post on Twitter or Facebook or something

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.240
and say, hey, friends that haven't donated to the Max Fun Drive,

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.880
you freeloaders, get in gear.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.960
There's only like four or five or six days left.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:23.920
I can't count.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.240
But it's time to get out there and support Max Fun Drive.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.200
I know you listen.

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:28.720
I know you do.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:31.120
I know you do, joke thieves.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.520
Seriously, thank you guys.

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.560
Thank you guys so, so much for your support.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.960
It really does mean so much to me.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:41.360
I don't have the words to express my gratitude,

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.400
my love, my affection.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:43.760
But it's there.

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:44.800
You got to trust it.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:49.920
I love you guys as much as I love getting bones deep in a whale.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.680
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.360
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Jacob Locker.

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:53.920
Thank you, Jacob.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:57.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user magicmissile1 who asks,

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.080
what if Sonic the Hedgehog was real?

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:01.680
Whoa.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.360
If he was real and alive in our world.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.520
Well, the end.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:05.920
That's it.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:06.640
That's all it is.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.080
He- Okay.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:08.720
Okay.

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.120
Are we talking about Sonic, video game Sonic,

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.640
or Sonic Jaleel White voiced Sonic from the Sonic cartoon?

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.760
Good question.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.640
If you fucking are capable of playing a Sonic game now

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.400
and not hearing Jaleel White's voice,

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.680
you're out of your mind.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:22.400
Yeah.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.680
Because I feel like that Sonic could be reasoned with.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.240
I feel like if Sonic the Hedgehog was real,

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.000
but it was one from the video game,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.560
it's basically you just have like a blue rat

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.000
looking for shiny keys in your home.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.560
That's my important question here is,

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.600
is he real in the real world looking like Sonic

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.560
from the video game?

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.080
Or is he real in the real world

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.760
and he's just a really fast hedgehog?

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:44.480
Can you reason?

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:49.040
Does he have the faculties for reason?

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.800
Because my guess would be dissection.

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.000
Right.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:52.880
Why?

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.200
Because everybody wants to know why he's so fast.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:55.440
Yeah.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.880
Well, I mean, if you capture Bigfoot,

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.960
they wouldn't just be like, go on about your business.

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.200
Nobody's seen Jaleel White in 15 years.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:04.400
And maybe he's inside Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:07.040
We all talk about capturing Bigfoot,

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.920
but wouldn't we know what to do with him when we got him though?

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.360
You think so much about the chase.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.960
You never think about the end game.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:16.320
You probably just, you try to recreate Harry and the Hendersons

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:19.600
and he would not be, he would not be down with that.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.880
I feel like he would probably just want to maul you.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.240
How big is Sonic the Hedgehog?

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.080
Is he the size of a regular hedgehog?

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.320
Because that's like, that would be kind of,

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.400
okay, what's worse?

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:32.160
Sonic the Hedgehog is real and he's small

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.360
like a regular hedgehog.

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:36.000
And so you never find him or he's the size of a human,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.360
which is the scariest.

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.160
Oh my God.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.000
You open your door and he's like,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.960
I was hoping you could give me some milk.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.120
And Sonic, you get out of here,

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.760
you weird two and a half foot tall hedgehog.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.200
I hate your guts.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.200
But what if he's fucking eye level and he's like-

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.880
Does he not sound like Jaleel White?

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.280
That was Justin's Jaleel White impression.

01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.880
That's right, Jaleel White.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.480
Justin and Jaleel White is a matchstick girl.

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.520
Did I do that?

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.960
Did I do that?

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.720
I'm back with like some plates.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.960
Could you put and have a cheese?

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.800
Please place a cheese for me.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.800
You got any chili dogs?

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.840
It's like a tiny ghostly Peebo Bryson.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.320
And Stefan comes out and he's like,

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.480
hello, I'm Stefan.

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.000
My voice is a little deeper.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.440
Come on, fuck.

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.080
I'm still very upsetting.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.520
Do you love me?

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.720
If he was real, I think he would find a very hollow-

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:45.760
He comes from a reality where his entire world is built around

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:48.400
not just his height, but his abilities.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.480
There was an architect at some point in Green Hill Zone

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.480
who's like, I don't know, a loop here?

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.200
And no one questioned the practicality of that.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.080
Maybe one day someone will be able to use this fucking thing.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.560
Because that's our only method of egress from our home,

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:07.120
is that we have to run really fast to the loop

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.640
and get out that way.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.160
And I also think I'm going to follow that up

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.760
with a pit with some spikes in it.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:14.000
Whoa, why would you do that?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
So if people fall down, they die.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.400
Yeah, we're just building like a hillside here.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.320
Why are you- I want them to die.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.640
Why would you put spikes anywhere?

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:22.960
Sure.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:23.200
Right?

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.880
Unless you're defending a castle.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.360
Like I see no use for spikes.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:31.200
I think Sonic the Hedgehog would find this to be a miserable existence

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:36.080
because there would be a cabal of,

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.600
I'll say a certain kind of internet user,

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:46.640
a certain kind of author of a certain type of fiction

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:51.440
that would hunt him down and fuck him to death.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:58.480
And now I'm imagining Julia White's screams of protest.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:00.800
Not again.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:02.800
Julia dogs.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.320
That one wasn't very good.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.640
Are we just now discovering that Justin does horrible,

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.160
horrible impressions of Julia White?

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.200
Replace Julia White with everybody

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.480
and I think that you are pretty much got my whole thing.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.680
That's my whole situation.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.240
What if one of the scientists that captured him

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.480
were the same people riding the-

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.600
Oh, Jesus.

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.200
Oh, can you imagine that?

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.280
We will continue to study him throughout the night.

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.120
You all can leave and I will keep an eye on him.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.320
Hey, Dave, can you keep an eye on Sonic?

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.360
We're all gonna leave and shut off the security cameras

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.640
to save electricity, so just don't do anything.

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.000
Hey, happy birthday, buddy.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:40.800
Happy birthday.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.400
If you look in the closet,

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.080
we've switched out one of the hazmat suits

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.400
for a tail suit. Go wild.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.400
We know you've been lonely since the divorce.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.000
Just really go wild.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.800
Hey guys, what's going on?

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.640
Do I smell chili sauce?

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.440
You do.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.920
It's not, I want you people listening at home to know

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:00.880
who might be worried about it.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:01.920
It's consensual.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.280
It is consensual.

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.720
Like this is not, we're not joking about it.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.760
I think it would take some negotiation though.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:08.800
Yeah.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:09.280
I think it would take-

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.520
No, you show that fucker one gold ring,

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.600
like every woman, and he's down the fuck.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.640
Oh, no.

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.880
And he's down the fuck, what?

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:17.840
Jesus.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.800
Girlfriend, are you gonna take out that joke I said?

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.800
Cause I feel like I could do that joke better.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.280
Yeah, okay.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.360
Let me try it again.

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.600
I think it would be consensual.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.360
Yeah, it would be, come on, consensual.

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:35.280
You show that guy one gold ring and he's ready to marry you.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.960
Like every woman ever.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.480
Boom, got him again.

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.600
Sorry, women.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.360
You had it too easy for too long.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.720
You wanna try it a third time?

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.000
Yeah, why don't we try one more time?

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.760
Yeah, give me a cue line.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.680
Man, I would just really fuck Sonic's face off.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.840
His face is on the ground, like in the movie Face Off.

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:04.880
None of this is usable.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.720
Here, let's try a fourth time.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:09.360
Okay.

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.760
I would fuck Sonic's face off.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.320
That's my new ringtone.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.480
Please don't fuck my face off.

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.760
Real quick, guys, we're heading out.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.200
We're gonna leave you now.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:32.880
Those of you who are still listening, which I'm sure is a small fraction of those who

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.160
began this journey with us.

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:38.800
But one more time, I just really wanna encourage you to go to maximumfun.org forward slash

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:44.960
donate and give anything you can is really helpful to our network.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.720
I know a lot of people have asked about making one-time donations.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
If that's all you can do, that is, of course, that money still spends.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.720
But monthly donations are really what help us to be sustainable as a network and help

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.320
us to budget a lot better.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.880
And even if you feel like you can't do 10, there's a $5 a month level that still gets

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.120
you all the bonus content and everything.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.960
That option is available to you.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.000
So maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Support the stuff you like, because that's the only way that the stuff you like keeps

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.360
getting created.

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:24.160
And we are so, so, so, so grateful to everybody who gives and thinks this show is worth their

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:24.720
money.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:30.080
I feel like there's usually some resistance that we see on Twitter, because we only do

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:30.720
this once a year.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:36.080
And so people who join in and haven't heard it before, I don't know, they are made uncomfortable

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.640
by the fact that we ask for money once a year.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.920
I guess twice a year, two episodes.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.000
But this year, I don't think I've seen any of that.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:42.480
And that's-

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.760
No, everybody's been so cool.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.360
Everybody's been so super fucking cool.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.640
And you guys have no idea how huge that is to me.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.160
It really does.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:54.640
It makes me legit real world excited every time I see somebody tweet, like, so happy

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.080
to support NBNBA AM.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:57.600
Thank you a lot.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.640
Thank you, guys.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.680
Thank you so much.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.400
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for using our theme song, It's a

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.480
Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.960
It'll be at fucking boat party.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:07.680
I won't.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.520
I'll be at my house, just thinking about it.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.080
I'll be sitting in a bathtub with a toy boat.

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:12.880
Like, it's the same.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:17.840
Thanks to everybody tweeting about the show, like Candace Pye, Ian Farrell, CL, Jessica

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:23.200

We really appreciate you spreading the word.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:33.680
Thank you, guys.

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:36.560
This final Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Nero, another friend of the family.

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.120
Thank you, Rachel.

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:44.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Amanda Lynn Samples, who asks, can my husband use Activia, the

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:46.560
yogurt, or is it just for women?

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:49.840
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.880
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.440
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.480
Kissed your dad.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:16:04.080
Skullway on the lips.
