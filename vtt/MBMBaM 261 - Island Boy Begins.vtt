00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.840
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern

00:47.840 --> 00:57.040
era, man. I'm Justin McElroy, and you're listening to the show. I'm- I'm Travis McElroy. Pull up a

00:57.040 --> 01:04.400
chair. Okay. The beach is fine. Dig your toes in the sand, come away with me. Okay. It's five

01:04.400 --> 01:08.880
o'clock somewhere. Now Justin, help me remember, you were in North Carolina or South Carolina or

01:08.880 --> 01:16.320
Jamaica? I was in Georgia. Oh, okay. Iby Island, Georgia, mon. Georgia-nayka. I'm still on island

01:16.320 --> 01:22.480
time. Listen guys, Jamaica is just a state of mind, and a country, I think? Or a common- I think it's

01:22.480 --> 01:29.360
a commonwealth? There's nothing common about Jamaica, Griffin. Yeah. Around here, it's always

01:29.360 --> 01:34.080
on time. Yeah, I'm still like- Are you still- Yeah, you're still coming down, it sounds like,

01:34.080 --> 01:39.840
because I don't- Yeah, I've got like a shrimp belly for sure. Yeah. Uh, that's still going.

01:39.840 --> 01:45.440
I hit the crab shack, you know I had to get up on that. I ate at a gastropub inside a gas station

01:45.440 --> 01:52.800
that I don't think was using gastropub as like a pun. I don't think it was being punny, even though

01:52.800 --> 01:58.080
it was, again, kind of inside a gas station. Kind of sounds like you did go to a sheets, mon.

01:58.720 --> 02:04.640
No, mon, I didn't. That was a- I was on island time. Still got the sand of the waves in my hair,

02:04.640 --> 02:11.440
and the ocean- You still have sand in your hair? I have like a permanent conch shell, like-

02:11.440 --> 02:17.360
Embedded in your chest. If you imagine like conch shell headphones that you just put on,

02:17.360 --> 02:21.840
like that's me right now. I can. If you could just photoshop me wearing conch shell headphones

02:21.840 --> 02:29.680
that I just invented, that's me right now. And maybe using a coconut radio. Uh, yeah, maybe.

02:29.680 --> 02:34.640
You've got a seaweed on the coconut telegraph. That's one of my JB songs that I was really

02:34.640 --> 02:41.680
grooving to down there. Sure. You got a seaweed skirt and pruney, pruney balls. Sure. You ever

02:41.680 --> 02:50.000
see Gilligan's Island? I was all of those guys. Um, Justin, beach time is over. I'm glad you had

02:50.000 --> 02:53.920
a good trip. Sounds like you had a really good trip, mon, but beach time is over. It's work time

02:53.920 --> 02:58.320
now, because Travis and I had to hold down the fort by ourselves. I can't just make that transition.

02:58.320 --> 03:05.840
I can't just pivot onto that and just like, get on, like, I guess this is a job now. We get money

03:05.840 --> 03:14.480
for it. It's time to button up your podcasting suit and clock in at Maximumfun.org. Old man Jesse

03:14.480 --> 03:19.280
is breathing down your neck to put out a podcast. But my problem is when you podcast, no one can

03:19.280 --> 03:24.080
hear what a great tan I got. Yeah. And how good I look right now. Well, why don't you describe it

03:24.080 --> 03:36.320
to us? Pale white, like a ghost. That's me. That's me right now. I was last night. I have to make a

03:36.320 --> 03:41.600
trip in two days, like because it's a nine hour, 10 hour drive. We have a baby, which makes it like

03:41.600 --> 03:47.360
a 15 hour drive. And we're just not doing that. So your baby is some sort of your baby is knowing

03:47.360 --> 03:51.280
I've traveled with the Chuckster a couple of times now. The beautiful, beautiful child,

03:51.280 --> 03:56.960
beautiful child, going to grow up to be a beautiful adult. Lots of promise in that human being. She is

03:56.960 --> 04:01.920
a singularity through which time is devoured and then barf back up twice as long. How long did it

04:01.920 --> 04:06.160
take? When did we leave? We did what should have been a four hour drive today in six and a half

04:06.160 --> 04:10.640
hours. Anyway, we split it up two days last night. I was in beautiful Statesville, North Carolina.

04:10.640 --> 04:18.080
Let me hear you Statesville. Okay. I was staying at the Courtyard Marriott, which is across from

04:18.080 --> 04:22.720
Big Shot's Tavern, where we got some takeout for the evening. And I was coming back up. I realized

04:22.720 --> 04:27.920
I left my gym shorts out in the car. So I went out to get those because that makes it nice,

04:27.920 --> 04:34.560
relaxing. Yeah, for sure. I was in the elevator with, and I was coming back up from the car

04:34.560 --> 04:40.960
and I got some, a few more essentials. So I had, I was wearing my cutoff sleeve muscle tee.

04:40.960 --> 04:46.000
I had my muscle shorts in my hand. I had a half finished bottle of brandy and I had two

04:46.000 --> 04:50.960
boxes of- With you? Yes, this is all with me. Why did you have a half finished bottle of brandy

04:50.960 --> 04:55.040
with you? You didn't let me, because I brought it back from the beach. So I went out to the car and

04:55.040 --> 05:00.080
I got it. So I got, I had, now let me start again. I was sleeveless shirt. I want to paint a picture.

05:00.080 --> 05:06.000
Sleeveless shirt, muscle shirt on, muscle shorts in my arms. Also half finished bottle of Paul

05:06.000 --> 05:14.000
Maison Grand Amber VSOP and two boxes of pralines that I brought from the beach. How is my island

05:14.000 --> 05:19.760
life? Pretty good. I guess, I guess you can bring it with you. Take the sunshine with you, I guess.

05:19.760 --> 05:26.000
And I was riding up in the elevator with these two old people who are like, I pushed my button.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.800
It was third floor. And I asked them when they came in, I was like, what floor am I on? And they

05:30.800 --> 05:35.360
were like, third. And I was like, oh, I'm already going there. And I bet they looked at me and knew

05:35.360 --> 05:41.040
like, ah, this must be the party floor. Look at this original party boy, just waiting to get the

05:41.040 --> 05:46.240
party going. We need to move. We can't be on this floor, the party floor. Did you, did you offer to

05:46.240 --> 05:51.040
share some of your pralines? Uh, yeah, I cracked the box open and they were like, ah, dentures.

05:51.040 --> 05:57.200
And I was like, ah, it's a tough break. It's a tough beat. No pralines for you. You want some of

05:57.200 --> 06:04.960
this Paul Maison Grand Amber VSOP? And they were like, no thank you, island boy. Island, island boy.

06:04.960 --> 06:12.640
This is, um, I'm going to lodge an official complaint here that I'm worried about you.

06:13.440 --> 06:17.600
Why? Cause I got too deep in the island spirit and I got salt water in my veins. I think you're really,

06:17.600 --> 06:23.600
you're so deep in the cut for a while. Like, I don't know, we've had some fun at James Buffett's

06:23.600 --> 06:33.520
expense and your expense by, um, by extension, but I'm worried that the, we've incepted ourselves.

06:33.520 --> 06:40.080
And now you, are you, hold on. I think I just heard a phone shutter go off and I think you might be

06:40.080 --> 06:45.520
sending us maybe a, I'm going to guess, cause I haven't gotten received the JPEG yet. Uh, sleeveless

06:45.520 --> 06:52.720
Justin tanned with just praline crumbles. Maybe a sunglasses tan line. All hither and thither. Ooh,

06:52.720 --> 07:00.960
good call Travis. Some, some raccoon pale realness. No, I, there's again, no tanning, pale boy,

07:00.960 --> 07:09.360
like a dead goat. Super duper pale. Just like living that island lifestyle though. I got a brand

07:09.360 --> 07:14.480
new one for the, I got a brand new Tybee shirt for the collection. Justin, I want to say here,

07:14.480 --> 07:19.600
you look exactly the same. You look exactly the same summer boy. I'm looking at you,

07:20.160 --> 07:24.720
that is a hundred percent normal Justin. Summer boy, that's city, that's city Justin I'm looking

07:24.720 --> 07:30.720
at. I, maybe I didn't get deep enough. It's an island state of mind though still. I will say

07:30.720 --> 07:36.160
it does look like you've lost a little weight. No, that's just the angle. I ate shrimp and pralines

07:36.720 --> 07:42.160
in every meal. Um, let's uh, let's thank you for saying, but that's just how my island,

07:42.160 --> 07:46.720
island lifestyle is manifesting itself in my physical form. That is just me projecting a

07:46.720 --> 07:51.920
mental image into your mind. I'm going to place a firm hand on the till here on the tiller.

07:51.920 --> 07:56.960
And I'm going to point us away from those choppy episode 259 waters. And I'm going to get us right

07:56.960 --> 08:01.840
back on. No, we're not going to talk about Antman. We're not going to talk about Antman. We're not

08:01.840 --> 08:06.480
going to talk about tabletop gaming. We're going to do our advice thing. Have you guys like checked

08:06.480 --> 08:09.680
out tabletop gaming? I'm going to read the first. I'm just going to start reading the first question.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.360
Justin, you want to tell us what we do on this podcast?

08:13.600 --> 08:19.680
Um, this is a podcast about karma and just being kind to one another and just getting into the same

08:19.680 --> 08:25.360
flow. The great light that comes from the one up above and we're all sort of riding on it. Okay.

08:25.360 --> 08:30.400
Dear brothers, a friend of mine came over to, there's some weird, uh, capitalization.

08:30.400 --> 08:33.200
It all makes sense when you get to the, to the title.

08:33.200 --> 08:40.320
Okay. Dear brothers, a friend of mine came over to study and now she won't leave. She's been here

08:40.320 --> 08:46.160
for six hours and seems to be settling in. How do I tell someone to go home without sounding like I

08:46.160 --> 08:56.160
dislike them? Thanks. Guest dressed in Germany. Okay. Six hours. Like the red flag has gone up

08:56.160 --> 09:01.840
for you after six hours. After six hours, you're starting to have a panic attack about your friend

09:01.840 --> 09:06.880
never leaving your place. Do you think that's not enough or too much? I think I fish and friends

09:06.880 --> 09:14.320
go bad after three days. Not one sixth of a day. They say friend, but they don't give any like,

09:14.320 --> 09:20.320
like maybe this is like person I met in class. We've had some good conversation. We talked about

09:20.320 --> 09:25.840
ant man. We talked about our beach vacations. We said, Hey, let's study together. I said,

09:25.840 --> 09:33.040
yeah, come over around noon. Uh, my afternoon is open for a day. Yeah. And now they're there

09:33.040 --> 09:38.080
and it's going on 6bm and you're like, Ooh, I need to start dinner, but I don't want to like

09:38.080 --> 09:41.920
start dinner for two. I don't want them. I don't want to, I don't want to just start making for

09:41.920 --> 09:46.400
myself. That seems rude, but I don't want them to get the impression I'm making dinner for both of

09:46.400 --> 09:51.040
us. I wish that I could have been a fly on that wall when your friend looked over at you and they

09:51.040 --> 09:56.960
said, who are you, who are you emailing? Nobody. I just, hopefully they email me back in the next,

09:56.960 --> 10:04.160
Oh, 20 minutes. And by email me back, I mean record a podcast and publish it. I want to talk

10:04.160 --> 10:14.560
to you too about the concept of a studi booty. Um, because I think I did it exactly once. There was,

10:14.560 --> 10:20.960
um, there was a, a young lady I sat next to in my like first Spanish class I took in college.

10:20.960 --> 10:25.360
And I was really, I was genuinely very bad at the language. Uh, so, so there's this,

10:25.360 --> 10:29.040
there's this woman in my Spanish class. I was like, Hey, you want to get together and say,

10:29.040 --> 10:33.520
she was very nice. And we had talked a few times and there was no, like, there was no romantic

10:33.520 --> 10:38.800
intention there, but I feel like you're a freshman in college. So there's this assumed romantic,

10:39.440 --> 10:46.480
like, um, intent everywhere. And so I went to her dorm room and we studied Spanish and it was mega

10:46.480 --> 10:51.040
awkward. Oh my God. Was it terrible? I couldn't get out of there fast enough because there was

10:51.040 --> 10:56.160
this, there was a tension hanging in the air that neither of us wanted, but it was, it was there.

10:56.160 --> 11:00.240
And I, I don't know. I feel like study, the idea of a study buddy, you've hit on,

11:00.240 --> 11:05.600
I'll tell you what complicates it, I think is the fact that this happens mainly in college,

11:05.600 --> 11:09.280
right? You're talking about a college thing. Yeah, you don't usually have study buddies at

11:09.280 --> 11:14.160
30 years old, Justin. Right. Yes. Correct. Uh, but by and large, you don't have,

11:15.840 --> 11:19.840
the reason we have different rooms in our home is because they communicate different messages.

11:20.480 --> 11:25.040
You, if you're in college and you want to like study someplace where you have control over the

11:25.040 --> 11:31.360
venue, it's probably going to be in one room that is also where you have sex and sleep. Like

11:32.400 --> 11:36.160
you have no other options. You can't bring them into- Or play World of Warcraft and sleep.

11:36.160 --> 11:39.760
Or just play World of Warcraft and just, oh man, get super high on the bonge.

11:40.400 --> 11:46.000
Can't bring them into the billiards room. Like. Yeah. Come, come to my study. Come to the study.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.120
Where we'll study. Or maybe in the ballroom. Come to my drawing room. Do you want to watch

11:51.120 --> 11:55.120
Akira with me and play World of Warcraft? Here we are in the conservatory. Oh, secret passage. We're

11:55.120 --> 11:59.840
in the library. Uh, conservatory leads to the kitchen. Um. What are you doing with that candlestick?

11:59.840 --> 12:04.240
Get out of here. Please, please no. My study buddy won't leave. I had to murder her with a wrench.

12:04.240 --> 12:10.160
Yeah. That, I mean, man. This is why you set a window. This is why you say like, yeah, come over

12:10.160 --> 12:14.560
like noon. We'll study for a couple hours. But if I, if I can't, if I can't get the,

12:14.560 --> 12:19.600
the participles and I need to keep learning, I can't leave yet. I haven't learned it.

12:19.600 --> 12:24.000
I need you to help me learn. Two things. You need two things to avoid this scenario in the future

12:24.000 --> 12:32.560
because it's already too late for you. Um, one, study group. Study group removes the onus of you.

12:32.560 --> 12:37.440
You can leave whenever you want. Two, neutral ground. You got to do it like at the library,

12:37.440 --> 12:43.440
on campus, or any, like you could hang out at a coffee shop, hang out at a restaurant, a bar.

12:43.440 --> 12:52.160
Name some other places that people can congregate, Travis, please. A park. Um, um, a racetrack.

12:52.160 --> 12:58.800
Hot tub at the hotel 12. A hot tub. Hot tubbing on the late night. Maybe some kind of memorial.

12:58.800 --> 13:05.360
Um, an art gallery. A hot tub. A hot tub at an art gallery. A hot tub at an art gallery. A hot tub

13:05.360 --> 13:08.960
that was actually a piece of art in the art gallery. Uh-oh. Weren't supposed to be in there.

13:08.960 --> 13:14.320
Now you're getting kicked out. You got to go to a hot tub museum. It was an installation. Ah,

13:14.320 --> 13:18.880
man. Why didn't I notice the pictures of dollar signs and George Bush everywhere?

13:18.880 --> 13:25.120
I should have known this was art. Why didn't I know that this was art before I got in it?

13:25.760 --> 13:32.000
This looks like a Banksy Ridge. Ironically, you were there to study art appreciation. Yeah.

13:32.000 --> 13:38.960
Ironically. And I sat in some art and peed in it a bit. That is not, I have not appreciated

13:38.960 --> 13:45.760
your art appropriately. You passed. That was the test. I've immersed myself in it. What if you

13:45.760 --> 13:50.480
came out and you got in the hot tub and the artist just came from around the corner and was like,

13:50.480 --> 13:59.440
finally, somebody gets it. It's just a tub, people. Look to your left. Look to your right.

13:59.440 --> 14:04.720
Right. By the time this class is finished, one of those two people will have pissed in an art.

14:07.280 --> 14:12.320
Do you guys want a Yahoo? Yes. This Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kansky climbing the ladder.

14:12.320 --> 14:18.720
Thank you, Zoe. It's by Yahoo Answers user. Something's gone wrong. I'm refreshing. Trying

14:18.720 --> 14:23.200
to get the bits and bytes to a lot. Nope. Something's gone wrong. Their avatar is a

14:23.200 --> 14:31.040
picture of Master Chief. It says, Halo 2. Let's go and call this guy Chief. Chief asks,

14:31.040 --> 14:37.440
I think my best friend is a vigilante. What should I do? This is so tough. My friend,

14:37.440 --> 14:41.600
name I will not mention, has been acting very tired, numerous times coming to high school with

14:41.600 --> 14:46.480
a limping posture and sickly look. Recently, there has been a local vigilante interfering with the

14:46.480 --> 14:51.760
drug trade to high schoolers. The vigilante actually held the drug dealer for the cops

14:51.760 --> 14:56.240
and fled the scene when the police began to turn hostile on the hero as everyone sees him,

14:56.240 --> 15:01.600
as I see him. This vigilante is sometimes seen patrolling the local town and has stopped kids

15:01.600 --> 15:05.680
from doing graffiti and vandalism, rescued a woman from being mugged and aided the fire department.

15:05.680 --> 15:09.200
The main reason I believe my friend to be the masked hero is because on the day of the burning

15:09.200 --> 15:18.080
tower, on the day of the burning tower, the vigilante was seen there and the following day,

15:18.080 --> 15:22.960
my friend had a broken arm. The vigilante also had a broken arm as he held the door above his head

15:23.520 --> 15:27.760
so people could escape. A firefighter had to pull the vigilante out and he was unconscious.

15:27.760 --> 15:32.160
Once he woke up, he left before he was arrested. I honestly don't know why the police hate this guy.

15:32.160 --> 15:36.560
I really think he's a hero and I'm afraid it's my friend. I don't plan on reporting him. But

15:36.560 --> 15:41.760
the question is, should I let him know, encourage him to stop or leave this be? He could get hurt.

15:41.760 --> 15:47.280
He has gotten hurt. And also, can someone explain why the police hate him? He is a hero, right?

15:47.280 --> 15:52.720
Does nobody else want what does what nobody else would do for the people that they don't even know?

15:52.720 --> 15:58.560
Thanks for your time. Also, I'm the only one who can see this friend. No, this is real. I have to

15:58.560 --> 16:03.680
believe this is real. I mean, it's Spider-Man, but I believe it in my heart. It's also kind of kick

16:03.680 --> 16:08.560
ass a little bit, but it's Spider-Man. It's the real life superhero movement. Yeah, I don't like

16:08.560 --> 16:14.960
that the vigilante is not named in the thing because I feel like if you have done that, like,

16:14.960 --> 16:20.160
if I was to start patrolling the streets as some sort of mass crime fighter, perhaps,

16:20.160 --> 16:26.240
Island Boy, I would name him the least terrifying. We need to stop. We need to wait before you

16:26.240 --> 16:32.000
continue. And I need to know everything about Island Boy. I need to know his origin story.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.800
Does he have a little hermit crab shell full of gadgets and gadgets? Okay. When he catches a bad

16:36.800 --> 16:42.720
guy, does he might tie him up? His hookah shell necklace turns into a whip. That's obvious.

16:42.720 --> 16:47.600
Yes. But that seems impractical. He has to, like, rip his neck off every time he wants to attack

16:47.600 --> 16:52.080
somebody. Now he has to awkwardly unhook it. You guys wait. You guys wait. Can one of you guys

16:52.080 --> 17:00.400
get my clasp? Oh God, no, not Island Boy. He has very baggy canvas shorts that have stripes on them,

17:01.120 --> 17:06.560
black and blue stripes. And the draw-offs do make it difficult to run. The drawstring of

17:06.560 --> 17:14.480
his shorts is also a whip. It's double two whips. You're very whip heavy.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.040
In the middle of a fight, two whips is what you need.

17:17.040 --> 17:22.320
We've de-whipped you. What now, Island Boy? We've got you surrounded and whipless. Oh,

17:22.320 --> 17:27.520
little d, you know. Your pants fell down. Yeah, but second whip. Eat my dick.

17:28.720 --> 17:34.880
His camouflage salt life flip flops are frisbees. No, what's a dangerous frisbee?

17:34.880 --> 17:37.840
No, that's it. You got it. You got it in one. They're just frisbees.

17:38.640 --> 17:44.240
No crime fighting applications whatsoever. Those are for Island Boy. That's not for crime. That's

17:44.240 --> 17:58.640
for Island Boy. And his sunscreen is impervious to low levels of radiation from the sun.

17:58.640 --> 18:09.040
It's like SPF 15. It's not even high SPF. No, very high SPF. But any sun-based enemies

18:09.760 --> 18:15.920
are going to have a hard time getting in there. Okay, so Sun Man is out. Solar Woman,

18:16.880 --> 18:24.400
not applicable. Solar Boy. He's also very strong and handsome and muscular.

18:24.400 --> 18:28.640
Mm-hmm. So it's loosely autobiographical.

18:29.600 --> 18:34.720
Anyway, Island Boy, if I'm out there patrolling the streets and people don't... The first thing

18:34.720 --> 18:40.160
I'm going to do is start brand building. I don't see the point in doing this if you're not building

18:40.160 --> 18:45.520
a legend. No, you got to make sure your social media is on point. Exactly. I'm not saving anybody

18:45.520 --> 18:50.160
until... I'm not saving anybody until they know the proper hashtag is what I'm saying to you.

18:50.160 --> 18:54.480
Like, I don't need a tweet storm where people are like, who is this masked boy

18:54.480 --> 18:58.800
who doesn't have a mask? Oh, it's just sunscreen. My bad. What's he doing with that necklace?

18:58.800 --> 19:04.320
I always assumed whenever I watched Superhero Origins that there's some reporter that's

19:05.120 --> 19:11.920
scooping the story and he's like, he's some kind of Island Boy. And then that's the headline,

19:11.920 --> 19:16.320
right? Right. I don't think Island Boy can just like walk into a room, double whip,

19:16.320 --> 19:20.880
whip, whip, and just say, by the way, I'm Island Boy. Tell your friends. And my favorite thing

19:20.880 --> 19:25.840
about this situation, about the Island Boy origin, is that so much crime is happening

19:25.840 --> 19:29.120
while you're out developing your street team, while you're out getting some rough sketches

19:29.120 --> 19:36.640
done of your logo. So much crime is going... It's like your uncle Jimmy Buffett dies because you

19:36.640 --> 19:41.440
didn't catch the right crime. You watch your fucking mouth. Uncle Jimmy Buffett dies. Uncle

19:41.440 --> 19:47.120
Jimmy Buffett blows out his flip-flops. He starts on a pop-top that you didn't save him from.

19:47.120 --> 19:51.360
And so he gets stung to death by a man of war or something like that. And he's like,

19:51.360 --> 19:56.000
with great power comes great responsibility, Island Boy. But then you, Island Boy, are like,

19:56.720 --> 20:02.800
nah. Nah, I'm just going to keep building my brand. That's what Spider-Man did. It worked

20:02.800 --> 20:07.360
out pretty good for him. That is true. He fought Bonesaw and became a famous wrestler.

20:07.360 --> 20:12.640
Uh, yeah. And I think that, but like what I'm saying, it's not just about ego. It's

20:12.640 --> 20:19.360
not about ego at all. If you don't build your legend, like, okay, if you have a legend and

20:19.360 --> 20:25.760
then you stop a crime, then the legend of that is going to keep other people from doing crime,

20:25.760 --> 20:32.800
right? You read the tipping point for a second. Sure. I'll wait. And then you got to do 10,000

20:32.800 --> 20:38.080
hours of superheroing. That's outliers. I don't even know what you're saying. You're weaving a

20:38.080 --> 20:42.880
tapestry of fear that you're going to place all over Huntington. No, a tapestry, a tapestry of

20:42.880 --> 20:50.320
chill. A tapestry of chill. A narrative of fear. Okay. That's fine. But like, would you stay chilling?

20:50.320 --> 20:54.080
Okay. I'm going to, let's, let's, um, gosh, I really don't want to say part the kimono,

20:54.080 --> 20:58.320
but it's the only appropriate thing for right here. Let's part the kimono. You're Island Boy.

20:58.320 --> 21:05.840
Let's assume, let's assume just for the basis of this conversation. Let's just assume for the

21:05.840 --> 21:13.040
basis of this conversation. What would somebody like me be doing? I can't imagine. All right.

21:13.040 --> 21:17.040
Let's assume for the basis. Don't you remember that time? No, you remember that time where you

21:17.040 --> 21:21.360
clearly saw somebody dressed like Island Boy at the top of that water tower. And I was on the

21:21.360 --> 21:25.760
ground looking up, pointing it up there. Okay. And he left before anybody could get a good look at

21:25.760 --> 21:31.120
his face. But we were very clearly in separate places. It's either you or it's Steven shark child.

21:31.920 --> 21:38.080
And I, let's just, okay. Yeah. I got another one. He wears those goggles. Yeah. And you can't have

21:38.080 --> 21:42.400
any goggles that you don't have goggles. That's true. But let's just assume it's you. Would you

21:42.400 --> 21:48.880
stay, would you stay in Huntington? Cause I feel like Island Boy couldn't fight crime in the

21:48.880 --> 21:56.080
decidedly not tropical Huntington, West Virginia. Well, or would that be the bet? That doesn't make

21:56.080 --> 22:01.040
fucking sense. Like Batman, there's not caves in Gotham except for the one that Bruce Wayne's

22:01.040 --> 22:06.480
family bought, but like Batman still patrols. Well, that's a good, ma'am. How has nobody cracked

22:06.480 --> 22:12.400
that? Hey Gotham, Gotham reporters. What is he? Batman? Where do bats chill? Under bridges? We

22:12.400 --> 22:17.680
looked under all the bridges. I don't know. Let's give up. There's one cave and there's one cave.

22:17.680 --> 22:21.760
You want to go there? Nah, we did the bridges. I feel like we did our due diligence. I give up.

22:23.360 --> 22:26.960
Um, what do you say? Listen, we, we've talked a lot about Island Boy and I feel like we've created

22:26.960 --> 22:31.760
a very lucrative property. Um, I feel like Marvel, if you want to buy that one, go for it. DC,

22:31.760 --> 22:36.720
if you want to buy it and completely ruin it, that's fine too. Um, but what do you do when

22:36.720 --> 22:41.920
your friend, let's say, let's assume Steven shark child, uh, all three of our friends, uh, is Island

22:41.920 --> 22:48.480
Boy. He's getting out there. He's do you remember the, the, the day of the tower fire? I remember

22:48.480 --> 22:52.560
it well. It was a, if I remember correctly, it was the three episode arc. It was the day of the

22:52.560 --> 22:59.280
burning tower. And, uh, I remember it well. Flames were everywhere inside the tower. Uh, and, uh,

22:59.280 --> 23:03.520
Island Boy showed up, saved the day, but then Steven shark child showed up to the class. All

23:03.520 --> 23:11.600
three of us are in, um, and both of his arms were missing and Island Boy lost his arms in the, in the

23:11.600 --> 23:16.240
day of the burning tower. So like, what do we say to him? How do you say, stop being Batman? You,

23:16.240 --> 23:21.520
Hey, hey, stop being the most important question for us, Griffin. Why did the police hate Island

23:21.520 --> 23:27.040
Boy so much? He's that's, I think that's the most pressing issue here. And I think the problem is

23:27.040 --> 23:32.000
Island Boy, as we all know, is, is, I mean, I don't want to say loose cannon because I feel

23:32.000 --> 23:37.680
like that it's an unknown commodity. Like, is he going to be super chill or is he going to like,

23:37.680 --> 23:41.040
be a little bit too drunk and a little bit awkward at the luau? You know what I mean?

23:41.040 --> 23:45.760
The drunken, the constant public drunkenness is probably like one of the, that, and like,

23:45.760 --> 23:51.520
he's, he does like sell weed. Like he does. We can't get around. He just sells a lot of his

23:51.520 --> 23:56.800
shorts. He shorts, comes out, comes out. So the public drunkenness, constant public drunkenness,

23:56.800 --> 24:03.200
he does sell weed to anyone regardless of age. Um, he sells weed to cops or if they ask,

24:03.200 --> 24:07.120
and also just like his Dick is out, like whenever he is in combat mode.

24:07.120 --> 24:12.560
One of the things I think it's probably because Peninsula Lad's family donated so much to the

24:12.560 --> 24:18.160
policeman's ball. Yeah. I think that's probably has put them against, uh, Island Boy. Now,

24:18.160 --> 24:23.200
Justin, is there an interesting, is there a strange dynamic between Island Boy and Peninsula

24:23.200 --> 24:27.600
Lad that neither one of them appears to be a grown ass adult? They're unaware of each other,

24:27.600 --> 24:33.440
actually. It's one of the life's great coincidences. I'm as surprised as anybody.

24:33.440 --> 24:38.080
Um, and then there's another superhero called Delta Burke.

24:42.240 --> 24:48.160
That's nothing. I teach in a high school and we just got a new principal. He used to coach

24:48.160 --> 24:53.200
wrestling and all part reports are that his handshake is super aggressive. I don't know

24:53.200 --> 24:58.880
this is how he tries to establish Alpha Dog or if he is just like that naturally. When I meet him,

24:58.880 --> 25:03.040
do I try to match his handshake just so he respects me or do I try to use a dainty

25:03.040 --> 25:10.560
southern shake so he knows he's dealing with a person of high intellect? That's from mano a mano.

25:10.560 --> 25:17.440
Here's the thing. If you don't react, he's not establishing anything. So I don't know. I've

25:17.440 --> 25:21.200
known people like that before who have gone in to shake your hand and just like crush it,

25:21.760 --> 25:28.400
but I feel like that's something a villain in a movie does. Not something like a handshakey

25:28.400 --> 25:33.840
principal does. Yeah. Can I make a suggestion? Maybe when he shakes your hand, you just make

25:33.840 --> 25:40.560
a face like, is that it? Why don't you do this? First time you meet this fool, this wrestle

25:42.080 --> 25:47.840
leader, I want you to grab his hand. I want you to grab his hand firm. Oh, as firm as you can,

25:47.840 --> 25:51.840
but that's not where you're going to scare him because obviously you're concerned about

25:51.840 --> 25:56.960
weaving a tapestry of fear over this wrestle principal. You shake his hand real hard with

25:56.960 --> 26:02.000
that one and then you sort of bring your other hand into his forearm like you're doing a Roman

26:02.000 --> 26:09.280
centurion handshake. But what's that on your finger? It's the gom jabbar. Looks like you've

26:09.280 --> 26:12.960
got a death needle on your finger. So you're going to have to look him in the eye and say,

26:12.960 --> 26:17.680
you must not fear. There's the mind. I want to hear the whole litany, the whole litany against

26:17.680 --> 26:22.800
fear from you, sir. And only then will I let you go. What's the mind killer? Say it now. Tell me

26:22.800 --> 26:30.240
now. Oh, if he's going to come in with strength, right? You use that intellect. You go for the hug.

26:31.520 --> 26:36.160
He goes for the handshake, you go for the hug. And then when you like go into wrap so hard,

26:36.160 --> 26:40.240
yeah, you wrap your, you wrap your arm around him, but then like your hand is on his back,

26:40.240 --> 26:43.600
right shoulder. Then it's scooches a little bit closer to his neck. What's that on your finger?

26:43.600 --> 26:51.040
It's the gum jabbar. Fear is the little death. We can all agree that no matter what the gum jabbar

26:51.040 --> 26:55.360
has got to be part of the equation. You can find one on Amazon. There was one for sale on Amazon

26:55.360 --> 27:03.440
prime day. I got, I got a box. I got a box with three gum jabbars and 16 cans of Pam cooking spray.

27:05.680 --> 27:09.040
You have the handshake, right? You make a connection. You say like, hey, let's grab a

27:09.040 --> 27:12.400
cup of coffee sometime, right? You sit down for a cup of coffee at Starbucks. He takes a drink.

27:12.400 --> 27:18.240
What's that in his coffee? Here, this is what I want to do. I'll go in. I'll hug him real tight.

27:18.240 --> 27:21.120
And what's that on my finger closer to his neck? It's the gum jabbar. What's that on my handshake

27:21.120 --> 27:24.400
hand? It's another gum jabbar. And also my whole body's slippery because I've sprayed

27:24.400 --> 27:30.400
myself down with Pam. He doesn't know which way to fuck me. How about this? He goes in for a super

27:30.400 --> 27:34.720
strong handshake. You are watered. You're fluid. You use his strength against him and you throw

27:34.720 --> 27:39.440
him over your shoulder to the floor. And what's that on the floor? It's a mattress made out of

27:39.440 --> 27:45.520
gum jabbars. Oops. Welcome to saw five. Then he spreads, he spreads his weight out evenly.

27:45.520 --> 27:51.440
So now he is not pierced. Yes. How about this? You go in and you go to shake his hand really hard.

27:51.440 --> 27:55.200
And then somebody comes in to shake his other hand. What's that? It's Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

28:00.080 --> 28:03.600
What's that? Wait, all 10 of his fingers, 10 gum jabbars.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.160
Man, I hope everybody's seen our Red Dune.

28:10.160 --> 28:14.000
I think that's probably a pretty big overlap with our audience. He brought somebody to help

28:14.000 --> 28:21.600
you shake his hand and he's got a sitar in his Ravi Shankar. Is that it? No, that's not a thing.

28:21.600 --> 28:25.600
He's driving a smart car. That's something. He's driving a smart car. That is something.

28:26.320 --> 28:43.680
Let's go to the money zone, sons. Travis, I have a simple question for you.

28:43.680 --> 28:50.320
Yes? What the fuck is base camp? Well, Justin, have you ever done, let's say, a project?

28:51.920 --> 28:56.960
Yeah. Okay. Let's start there. I want to start at the beginning.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.760
Every day is like a little project. Yeah. Every day is a project. You wake up,

29:01.760 --> 29:06.320
check that one off your list. In this day and age, most of the time the people you work with

29:06.320 --> 29:11.120
are not in the same room, right? Yeah, that's true. I work in a remote office.

29:11.120 --> 29:15.840
Right? Base camp helps you wrangle people with different roles, responsibilities,

29:15.840 --> 29:21.280
and objectives towards a common goal, finishing your project together. Base camp runs in the

29:21.280 --> 29:26.000
cloud on secure servers, so you don't have to mess with anything technical. It's going to help you

29:26.000 --> 29:29.520
bring all your people together, get them on the same page, make sure everything's running smoothly,

29:29.520 --> 29:34.880
and you're not constantly having you do calls or say like, hey, did you do that? Oh, was I supposed

29:34.880 --> 29:40.880
to do that? Oh, shit. Base camp's going to help you take care of that way smoother, run everything,

29:40.880 --> 29:44.720
and not feel like an idiot at the end of the day. Base camp, look at it this way, it's really going

29:44.720 --> 29:49.280
to let you feel like a big, big old W on the day when it comes to business. I don't know if base

29:49.280 --> 29:53.200
camp can help you in your personal life. I don't know if they can get things on board with helping

29:53.200 --> 29:58.480
you find love, but finish your project, you betcha. And listeners of my brother and my brother and

29:58.480 --> 30:05.280
me can try base camp absolutely free for two months. Go to basecamp.com slash my brother,

30:05.280 --> 30:09.440
special landing page. You're going to like the logo you see at the top, people. It's going to

30:09.440 --> 30:14.720
bring back some warm, fuzzy memories or horrifying memories. Go check it out. Base camp.com slash my

30:14.720 --> 30:19.040
brother. Finish your project. If you can do it in two months, you never have to pay base camp

30:19.040 --> 30:25.360
anything. Try to work that angle. That's what they were hoping for. I'd love to go to the website,

30:25.360 --> 30:30.720
but I can't fucking see it. Well, let me take a look at your eyes. You've got all that sunshine

30:30.720 --> 30:35.840
in your eyes. Oh, yeah, Justin, this is just- I've gotten help. I've gone beach blind. Yeah,

30:35.840 --> 30:40.160
it's not beach blindness, buddy. That is just good old fashioned astigmatism.

30:40.160 --> 30:44.720
Oh, man. Yeah, it's like, let me get into your, let me get into your

30:44.720 --> 30:50.160
oculars real quick. Let me just see what's- Oh yeah, just full little jellyfish. A lot of people

30:50.160 --> 30:53.680
don't realize that when they get in the water, sometimes their eyes just get full of little

30:53.680 --> 30:57.360
jellyfish and you can't see them, but they're there and they're growing. And now your eyes

30:57.360 --> 31:01.600
aren't there anymore. Well, now I need glasses. Travis, what should I do? Help, help, help. I

31:01.600 --> 31:05.200
don't, again, I don't want to burst your bubble, but glasses are not going to help you, my friend.

31:05.200 --> 31:10.400
Your eyes are just a bunch of little jellyfish now. Okay, but Justin, you can at least look cool

31:10.400 --> 31:14.720
as you go blind from just millions of jellyfish stings. Billions, billions and billions of

31:14.720 --> 31:19.520
jellyfish stings. Billions of tiny jellyfish stings just ruining your eye jelly. My Brother,

31:19.520 --> 31:23.520
My Brother and Me is supported in part by Warby Parker, friend of the show. We've talked about it

31:23.520 --> 31:28.080
a bajillion times. I'm sure you know about it, but maybe you've thought, oh, I don't know. Maybe I

31:28.080 --> 31:33.840
have jellyfish in my eyes. Well, we've got the solution sort of. It's a new concept in eyewear,

31:33.840 --> 31:38.160
fashion forward. If it's a new concept, haven't we talked about it a billion times? Well, new in

31:38.160 --> 31:43.600
like the grand scheme of things. Look at a calendar, Justin. Imagine that all of time is represented in

31:43.600 --> 31:47.760
a calendar. All right, Neil deGrasse Tyson, how about you just tell them about the fucking glasses?

31:47.760 --> 31:54.000
Okay, great. Well, you can get a prescription pair of glasses for $95 and that's including the lenses.

31:54.000 --> 32:00.560
I foolishly, I foolishly bought glasses, not at Warby Parker. I bought it at my optometrist

32:00.560 --> 32:03.760
because they kind of bullied me into it. They actually sort of locked the door behind me, wouldn't

32:03.760 --> 32:10.000
let me leave. They're like, you can't drive home with these eyes. $400. Oh, God. Were those for those

32:10.000 --> 32:15.760
Randy Jackson shades? No, they, they actually, those are illegal now. Those Randy Jackson glasses

32:15.760 --> 32:20.160
because I'm a married man. I don't need like trim thrown at me in the street because I'm wearing those,

32:20.160 --> 32:26.400
those fucking tight ass Randy Jacksos. So yeah, I can't, I'm not allowed to wear those anymore.

32:26.400 --> 32:31.120
So that Warby Parker has this home try on program where you can order five pairs of glasses and

32:31.120 --> 32:34.880
they're shipped right to you. You try them on, you find the frames that work for you,

32:34.880 --> 32:39.680
and then you send them back free with no obligation to buy them. You find the ones

32:39.680 --> 32:44.240
that look good on you. You get input from your friends, see what they think. And if you go to

32:44.240 --> 32:49.360
Warby Parker slash my brother. Well, there's a dot com in there, so try again. You go to Warby

32:49.360 --> 32:59.760
Parker dot com. That's W A R B Y P A R K E R dot com slash my brother to get free three day shipping

32:59.760 --> 33:06.560
on your final frame choice. That's Warby Parker dot com slash my brother. I have a message here,

33:06.560 --> 33:09.760
personal message. If you want to get a personal message for yourself or your small business on

33:09.760 --> 33:13.600
the show, go to maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron and you can find out how to do it there. Uh,

33:13.600 --> 33:18.160
we've gotten a few emails from people like, Hey, I want a Jumbotron. We can't, we don't do them.

33:18.160 --> 33:22.400
We don't process those. I promise. Uh, go to maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron and you'll figure

33:22.400 --> 33:27.040
out how to do it there. Uh, this message is for Nicholas Bale and it's from Donna, Eric,

33:27.040 --> 33:35.120
Mark, Matteo, and John. They all say in one beautiful chorus, sing song voice. Hey, Nicholas

33:35.120 --> 33:40.400
Bale, you old lovable turd, you here's to a great new year full of board games, rock climbing,

33:40.400 --> 33:45.600
college parties, and just being the best turd you can be. We hope you have a great birthday spent

33:45.600 --> 33:52.640
with the best friends a turd could ask for. Try not to get your turd smell on your presents from

33:52.640 --> 33:59.120
your great friends. P.S. you're a turd. What are they trying to get across? That's a weird auto

33:59.120 --> 34:08.800
correct. Um, oh, sorry. I misread and everywhere it said turd. It says great guy. So it's kind of

34:08.800 --> 34:12.720
weird that maybe I need to go to Warby Parker. Maybe I'm the one with the jellyfish eyes.

34:12.720 --> 34:17.760
The worm has turned. The jellyfish has turned. The worm has turned. I also have a quick question

34:17.760 --> 34:24.000
for Josh from Jeremy. Um, Josh, get back to Jeremy as soon as you can. Um, Jeremy really needs to

34:24.000 --> 34:30.960
know. Do you know if Earl Pitts is still on the radio? So there it is. A hundred dollars just

34:30.960 --> 34:37.200
sort of. Earl Pitts, of course, that beloved Gary Burbank character, Earl Pitts, is he still on the

34:37.200 --> 34:44.560
radio? Just sort of loaded a hundo into a canister and fired it into space. And that's fine because

34:44.560 --> 34:49.600
we're in space and we caught it. Thank you for the money very much, Josh. We appreciate your money.

34:49.600 --> 34:53.760
I mean, Jeremy, thank you very much, Jeremy, for the money. We appreciate all of your money. Josh,

34:53.760 --> 34:57.440
do get back. No matter who sent it, no matter who sent the money, I appreciate the money.

34:58.160 --> 35:05.360
What was that noise? Did someone just get a game center request? No, uh, just, uh, this Earl Pitts

35:05.360 --> 35:10.880
video audio played on my, uh, computer. Okay. So you're really dialed in then. Yeah. I really

35:10.880 --> 35:17.440
want to get the whole Earl Pitts story. Here's a quick click of Earl Pitts that I can put in.

35:19.440 --> 35:21.840
Hey, y'all, it's me. I've never heard Earl Pitts.

35:25.200 --> 35:32.080
Ty is a pedantic person. I think when he pronounces these words, it's in a very show-offy

35:32.080 --> 35:43.680
way. Gyro. Hero. Sacre bleu. Sacre bleu. Ayers Rock. Uluru. What you are witnessing is real.

35:43.680 --> 35:50.720
The participants are not actors. They are actual litigants with real cases. They call in via Skype

35:50.720 --> 35:57.280
to Judge John Hodgman's court, the real people's court. Now I call you to Judge John Hodgman's

35:57.280 --> 36:02.560
internet court. Find it at Maximumfun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

36:15.440 --> 36:23.040
Farm wisdom. Farm wisdom. Put some dip inside your lip. Farm wisdom. Brought to you by Earl Pitts.

36:23.040 --> 36:28.000
Brought to you by Snooze. The dip you put in your lip for farm stuff. It'll make you better

36:28.000 --> 36:33.920
at hay collecting. This is actually from Sammy. Thank you, Sammy. Thank you, Sammy. And thank you,

36:33.920 --> 36:38.480
Snooze, for sponsoring the show once again. It's dip. What a great friend we have in Snooze.

36:43.520 --> 36:50.080
Special relationship. There's a lot of farm wisdom. This is an encyclopedia of farm wisdom

36:50.080 --> 36:56.160
from Sammy. Thank you, Sammy. Number one. Kicking it off. Top of the list. Goat poop can be fatal.

36:56.160 --> 37:00.480
Our beef cattle were dying off unexpectedly. After looking into the cause, we found out

37:00.480 --> 37:04.400
it was the feces from our goats on the farm that were killing our herd.

37:04.400 --> 37:11.120
Sorry, Elizabeth Gilbert. Goats are the worst. Goats, I don't care what your affiliation. They're

37:11.120 --> 37:16.400
the worst animal ever. Number two. I showed cattle as a kid. Now that was about-

37:16.400 --> 37:21.920
There's been Sammy wisdom. Sammy wisdom. I showed cattle as a kid. Now that was about

37:21.920 --> 37:27.840
15 years ago. Or are they saying now that was about 15 years ago? Yep. I literally put a leash

37:27.840 --> 37:33.520
on a full grown heifer and walked her around a ring for a show ring for fun. We had to clean

37:33.520 --> 37:39.440
these cattle before showing. Guess how we bathe them? We used a pressure washer. Oh no. In

37:39.440 --> 37:44.160
hindsight, that seems like an odd and painful way to clean these poopy animals, but that's the norm.

37:44.160 --> 37:51.840
That's farm wisdom. No, Sammy. It's not. It's not. Farm cruelty. Farm cruelty. That was right this

37:51.840 --> 38:01.680
whole time. Farm cruelty. You are Bovine Jack Bauer is what you are. Number three. Sometimes I just

38:01.680 --> 38:09.120
hit goats with a hammer for fun. All right, Sammy. I'm a psychopath. Number three for real though.

38:09.120 --> 38:14.640
How do you know if your corn is growing at an appropriate rate? This old saying, knee high by

38:14.640 --> 38:22.960
the 4th of July. Yes. I also apply that metric to my daughter to know if she's stunting or not.

38:23.600 --> 38:28.560
Knee high by the 4th. Does everybody like, all right guys, February 5th, you know the drill.

38:28.560 --> 38:34.880
Get that corn in the ground. We got to have a fair corn race. Knee high by the 4th of July.

38:34.880 --> 38:39.200
Number four. Cows don't actually sleep standing up. If you get to that point though, if you get

38:39.200 --> 38:46.080
to 4th of July and it is not knee high, what is your next action? You just give up. You just give

38:46.080 --> 38:56.240
up. Fuck this corn. Do farmers have uniform bottom halves of their legs? I was going to say cows,

38:56.240 --> 39:03.040
but that would get confusing. Do they have, is a farmer, if you lined up all the farmers in the

39:03.040 --> 39:12.320
world, all their knees are like 20 inches high. Cows don't actually sleep standing up. They do

39:12.320 --> 39:19.200
lay down. Cow tipping is not a thing. That's not true. It's Sammy, these are lies and they're cruel.

39:19.760 --> 39:23.920
Like they're, they're cruel truths and horrible lies, Sammy. That's not the name of the segment.

39:23.920 --> 39:27.760
It's called farmways. Cows don't actually sleep standing up. They do lay down to sleep and then

39:27.760 --> 39:34.240
they never get up. And why aren't they moving or breathing? What did I do? Stop. Stop. Hammer time.

39:34.240 --> 39:39.200
By which I mean I'm going to go hit some goats with some hammers. Fine. Good riddance to bad

39:39.200 --> 39:44.400
animals. Number five. Final piece of farm wisdom. This one's going a little long, but I still feel

39:44.400 --> 39:50.000
like it's good. To make your dairy cattle milk more efficient, throw hammers at them before they wake

39:50.000 --> 40:00.960
up. To make your dairy cattle milk more efficient, feed them poison. To make your dairy cattle milk

40:00.960 --> 40:08.640
more efficient, feed them a diet rich in alfalfa. So that one's not especially sexy. Not as sexy as

40:08.640 --> 40:13.520
the other ones. That's an important tip, Sammy. You got to close with some heat. Yeah, don't you

40:13.520 --> 40:18.320
maybe lead with alfalfa and then we think, oh Sammy, she sounds like a normal human being.

40:18.320 --> 40:25.040
And then you get into the hammers and then you get into the lava ceremonies. To appease the

40:25.040 --> 40:30.160
gods of your farm. Then you get into the ritual burials. Thank you for sending those in, Sammy.

40:30.160 --> 40:33.680
Thank you for sending those in, Sammy. I do miss farm wisdom when we don't receive it.

40:33.680 --> 40:38.960
If you've got something, you can send it to MBAM at Maximumfun.org. That's where all questions

40:38.960 --> 40:43.200
and advice and relevant comments should go. Just put farm wisdom in the subject line, I guess.

40:43.200 --> 40:49.040
Do you guys want Yahoo? Yeah, sure. This one was sent in also by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

40:49.040 --> 40:53.920
She is on a hot streak. Thank you, Zoe. It's by Yahoo Answers user, Reesis, who asks,

40:55.280 --> 40:58.960
is it possible to ask a question without using a question mark?

41:00.880 --> 41:07.120
What do you think? That's a question mark. Oh, fuck. Is it? No. It's a question mark.

41:07.120 --> 41:11.040
It's a question mark. Tell me now the name of your dad.

41:12.480 --> 41:17.200
No, that's a- That's a declarative.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.640
That's a- Not a declarative.

41:18.640 --> 41:20.960
A pejorative. No.

41:20.960 --> 41:22.720
Demonstrative. Deformative.

41:22.720 --> 41:23.920
A deformative. No, it's when you

41:24.800 --> 41:26.560
give an order. What is your-

41:26.560 --> 41:30.640
Imperative. Let me try this. Let me try this. What is your dad's name? I want to know.

41:32.480 --> 41:35.120
How about, oh, how about this? Remind me of your dad's name.

41:35.120 --> 41:38.480
That's a question mark, yeah. No, it's not.

41:39.280 --> 41:43.520
But it's also an imperative. Travis put one in with this inflection, but-

41:44.240 --> 41:48.720
What is your dad's name? Let me try again. What is your dad's name?

41:51.360 --> 41:53.680
What about this? What about this? What is your dad's name?

41:56.320 --> 42:00.560
Okay, I got it. Okay. What if you went with this? Your dad's name is-

42:00.560 --> 42:03.760
Oh, I see. That's fun.

42:04.880 --> 42:07.040
Until they interrupt you or you pass out.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.000
What about this? Dad's name. Go.

42:12.560 --> 42:15.760
My dad's name is Regis, and I would like to know yours.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.160
For example.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.840
See, then it's not an imperative. Then it's like open-ended. They can-

42:21.840 --> 42:26.560
I don't- Listen, I could give a damn. Tell me your dad's name or don't. Whatever. No skin off my balls.

42:26.560 --> 42:32.320
Is it possible to ask a question without saying no skin off my balls?

42:33.120 --> 42:34.880
There's four different types of sentences, right?

42:34.880 --> 42:36.880
Right. Statement or just-

42:36.880 --> 42:38.080
Or declarative, right?

42:38.080 --> 42:38.480
Right.

42:38.480 --> 42:39.440
There's the-

42:39.440 --> 42:46.560
My dad's name. As long as we're grammar girling, let's do it. My dad's name is Regis.

42:47.120 --> 42:48.320
My dad's name is Earl.

42:48.320 --> 42:52.560
Yeah, but how can you ask- Okay, using the first sentence type of statement,

42:52.560 --> 42:55.040
you could ask a question with a statement.

42:55.040 --> 42:58.320
It doesn't have to be- I would like to know what your dad's name is.

42:58.320 --> 43:01.280
That's good. I don't know your dad's name.

43:02.320 --> 43:04.400
I've never met your dad, but I want to.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.600
You have to say, I don't know your dad's name, and then stare at them expectantly.

43:07.600 --> 43:08.080
Right, sure.

43:08.080 --> 43:11.120
That's important. I don't know your dad's name, and that's your fault.

43:11.120 --> 43:14.560
Question that's obvious. A command, right?

43:16.000 --> 43:16.880
Dad's name now!

43:16.880 --> 43:18.640
Dad's name on three!

43:18.640 --> 43:20.000
Dad's- Tell me the name of the dad.

43:20.720 --> 43:23.280
Your dad's name. Your dad's name.

43:23.280 --> 43:25.040
Dad's name, or he dies.

43:25.040 --> 43:28.240
No, it has to be command. Give me the name of the dad.

43:28.240 --> 43:32.240
Give me the name of the dad now. Give the dad's name to me.

43:33.520 --> 43:34.720
Stop stalling.

43:36.560 --> 43:39.680
Stop stalling, McClane. Tell me your dad's name.

43:39.680 --> 43:42.160
I'm ready for the name of the dad. I've waited long enough.

43:42.160 --> 43:44.480
Slake my thirst for your dad's name.

43:44.480 --> 43:45.280
Let me die.

43:46.320 --> 43:50.160
Give me the sweet girlates of death and tell me the name of your dad.

43:50.160 --> 43:55.920
I am a genie, and the only way I can become Jyn is with the command word as the name of your father.

43:55.920 --> 43:56.960
Now, please, yes.

43:57.520 --> 43:59.680
In the shade, name your dad.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.440
Griffin, that was declarative.

44:01.440 --> 44:02.800
You say you fucked up.

44:02.800 --> 44:04.000
Hold on, wait, what were we doing?

44:04.640 --> 44:06.800
The last- that was command. The last type-

44:06.800 --> 44:09.440
Your dad's name, so I may become Jyn!

44:10.400 --> 44:11.360
Shazam!

44:11.360 --> 44:13.680
That's not a command, because now we're on the exclamation-

44:13.680 --> 44:16.720
Give me the name of your father, so I may become Jyn.

44:17.440 --> 44:18.960
No, exclamation.

44:18.960 --> 44:22.560
Jyn!

44:22.560 --> 44:26.560
I have been cursed for a million centuries by Alibaba.

44:27.200 --> 44:29.120
Declarative, declarative, declarative.

44:29.120 --> 44:29.600
Declare.

44:29.600 --> 44:30.480
Not an exclamation.

44:30.480 --> 44:34.240
I have been cursed for a million centuries by Alibaba.

44:36.000 --> 44:36.720
That's a statement.

44:36.720 --> 44:37.280
That's a question.

44:37.280 --> 44:38.000
That was a statement.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.800
Did Alibaba curse me until I knew your dad's name?

44:41.600 --> 44:42.240
He did.

44:42.240 --> 44:43.680
He did, in fact.

44:43.680 --> 44:46.000
Arabian Nights!

44:46.000 --> 44:48.720
Arabian Nights!

44:48.720 --> 44:49.280
I'm Jyn.

44:51.280 --> 44:52.080
Kazam!

44:55.600 --> 44:59.040
The only way I can make it rain burgers is if you tell me your dad's name.

44:59.040 --> 44:59.600
I'm Jyn.

45:00.480 --> 45:01.280
I don't know, Shaq.

45:01.280 --> 45:02.240
We read through the script.

45:02.240 --> 45:04.000
I think we're gonna have to take another pass at this.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.400
There's not a single question mark in the whole thing.

45:06.400 --> 45:08.720
There's not any E's either, check it out.

45:10.720 --> 45:14.800
How about instead of all the parts where you're yelling at the boy to tell him his dad's name,

45:14.800 --> 45:17.120
um, you do some rapping?

45:17.120 --> 45:20.400
Sounds good to me.

45:20.400 --> 45:21.440
Sounds very good.

45:23.440 --> 45:25.840
Uh, so you guys are struggling with this one.

45:25.840 --> 45:30.720
Exclamation, um, the article that I found to remind me of this because I'm 34,

45:31.280 --> 45:36.000
um, it ends with an exclamation part and it makes a statement with emotion.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.720
There are three examples that they have offered here.

45:38.720 --> 45:41.200
Here are the three examples of an exclamation.

45:41.200 --> 45:42.880
I can't find the butter!

45:42.880 --> 45:45.040
The Tyrannosaurus Rex was huge!

45:45.040 --> 45:46.080
I love this movie!

45:47.200 --> 45:48.000
It's a cool day.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.600
Is that all the same idea?

45:49.600 --> 45:51.120
That's a cool day.

45:51.120 --> 45:53.440
I want some more popcorn from the concession stand.

45:54.560 --> 45:56.000
That Tyrannosaurus was huge.

45:56.000 --> 45:56.960
I love this movie.

45:57.760 --> 45:59.680
I want to see Jurassic World again.

45:59.680 --> 46:01.520
I love your dad but forgot his name!

46:03.120 --> 46:06.400
I'm so frustrated that I don't know your dad's name and you can help!

46:06.400 --> 46:06.960
Kazam!

46:06.960 --> 46:13.440
It's been too long since I've seen Kazam, also what's your dad's name?

46:13.440 --> 46:14.320
That's question mark.

46:14.880 --> 46:18.880
I want to watch Kazam with your dad but don't know what to put on the invitation.

46:18.880 --> 46:21.280
I can't remember the name of the movie Kazam.

46:21.280 --> 46:21.520
Fuck!

46:23.600 --> 46:26.000
I fucked it up because I'm dead right there at the end.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.400
Is your dad's name Kazam?

46:28.400 --> 46:29.040
Question mark!

46:29.600 --> 46:30.560
Man, we're bad at this.

46:32.080 --> 46:36.320
What if we did a new podcast just called Boy School and it was the three of us and

46:36.320 --> 46:38.160
we just tackled stuff like this.

46:38.160 --> 46:39.120
I think that's a hit.

46:41.520 --> 46:42.960
I'm never going to forget this.

46:42.960 --> 46:44.240
No, I won't forget this either.

46:46.160 --> 46:47.520
This is good for your kids.

46:47.520 --> 46:49.520
It's good for kids, it's good for adults.

46:50.080 --> 46:53.040
Now your kids are actively learning about this stuff in school.

46:53.040 --> 46:57.280
Kids are currently learning about how to inquire about people's dad's names in all kinds of

46:57.280 --> 46:58.800
really fun and funny ways.

46:59.360 --> 47:00.400
And the history of Kazam.

47:00.400 --> 47:01.520
And the history of Kazam.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.280
But the adults have forgotten it.

47:05.280 --> 47:08.000
That's why that horrible Jeff Foxworthy show is still on the air.

47:08.000 --> 47:08.800
Can you believe that?

47:10.800 --> 47:12.480
So yeah, I think we spin that up.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.000
I think Boy School episode one.

47:15.440 --> 47:16.960
I think we save it for sweet sweet.

47:16.960 --> 47:17.920
Print it.

47:17.920 --> 47:18.320
Print it.

47:18.880 --> 47:20.480
Put it on a t-shirt and sell it.

47:21.920 --> 47:22.720
You do another question?

47:23.760 --> 47:28.400
I get pretty bad stage fright when it comes to urinals in men's restrooms.

47:28.400 --> 47:32.640
If there isn't a divider between heads, I almost definitely won't be able to pee if

47:32.640 --> 47:34.000
someone is next to me.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.680
This can't even resort to me having to pretend to go just so I can find another restroom

47:37.680 --> 47:39.680
so I don't look weird in front of strangers.

47:39.680 --> 47:44.160
Is there some magic solution to peeing in public restrooms or I'll forever be that guy

47:44.160 --> 47:46.000
that pees standing up in the stall?

47:46.000 --> 47:48.320
That's from public pissing problemo.

47:49.760 --> 47:50.560
My dude.

47:50.560 --> 47:55.840
I only laugh because the idea of pretending to go when you can't actually make any liquid

47:55.840 --> 47:59.520
come out of your penis has to just be you going, oh yeah.

47:59.520 --> 48:03.200
Oh it feels so good loving this.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.080
What a release.

48:04.080 --> 48:06.720
It's crazy that this feels so good.

48:07.520 --> 48:10.320
It's just stinky water coming out of my wing wong.

48:10.320 --> 48:11.360
That's crazy.

48:11.360 --> 48:11.680
Guys.

48:11.680 --> 48:12.720
But it feels so right.

48:12.720 --> 48:14.240
You guys are feeling this too right?

48:14.240 --> 48:15.600
Oh man this is crazy.

48:15.600 --> 48:16.880
We are having a moment.

48:16.880 --> 48:18.640
My wing wong feels righteous.

48:20.560 --> 48:24.320
I think your main problem is that you don't have to be bad enough.

48:24.960 --> 48:30.240
Because if I really have to pee, I don't care if the ghost of my great grandmother appears

48:30.240 --> 48:33.040
in the urinal cake like, no please don't.

48:33.040 --> 48:34.240
Like I'm going to go for it.

48:35.040 --> 48:36.560
Because I have to pee.

48:36.560 --> 48:41.040
I'll tell you the ultimate ruse though is when you walk into, oh worst pee situation

48:41.040 --> 48:41.840
of my life.

48:41.840 --> 48:43.280
I was, I love me undies.

48:43.280 --> 48:44.400
I love me undies so much.

48:44.400 --> 48:47.680
They do not have a hole in the front for you to get a tuck, a good tuck going.

48:47.680 --> 48:48.320
So you have to basically.

48:48.320 --> 48:49.360
Or you wear them backwards.

48:49.360 --> 48:50.160
It's one of those two.

48:50.960 --> 48:52.640
No there's no hole in the butt either.

48:52.640 --> 48:53.440
Important to point out.

48:53.440 --> 48:54.960
Quick correction to what Justin just said.

48:55.520 --> 48:59.520
So it's a full blown pull down your pants and pee in the urinal situation.

48:59.520 --> 49:09.280
I was at Worst Fest, a fun little festival put together by the city council of like San

49:09.280 --> 49:10.400
Marcos or somewhere.

49:10.400 --> 49:11.760
No it's like an hour south from here.

49:12.320 --> 49:15.760
You go to it though and it's all sausage and beer and it's fun and people get really,

49:15.760 --> 49:16.480
really turnt.

49:16.480 --> 49:19.840
And it's kind of scary actually now that I'm talking about it.

49:19.840 --> 49:21.360
Because it's kind of like Nine of the Living Dead.

49:21.360 --> 49:23.360
Anyway, worst bathroom situation.

49:23.360 --> 49:25.040
I walked in after waiting in line.

49:25.040 --> 49:27.200
It's slam, slam jams.

49:27.200 --> 49:29.520
Yeah with a W, with a U.

49:29.520 --> 49:30.640
Worst bathroom situation.

49:31.520 --> 49:32.960
No okay I'll try to avoid those.

49:32.960 --> 49:34.880
It was very bad nightmare bathroom.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.480
And I walked in and what's up?

49:36.480 --> 49:37.600
Oh it's a trough.

49:37.600 --> 49:39.200
Like at a baseball stadium.

49:39.200 --> 49:39.700
Nice.

49:40.320 --> 49:44.400
And so when you see that, when you see that or you see this is also applicable to a no

49:44.400 --> 49:48.240
wall which is not ideal but infinitely better than a trough.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.520
You just sort of pivot and you turn towards the stalls and then all of a sudden you're

49:53.520 --> 49:54.240
waiting on a stall.

49:54.240 --> 49:55.600
And somebody's like what are you waiting on a stall?

49:55.600 --> 49:59.200
And you say yeah I got a lot of turds to go to.

49:59.200 --> 49:59.920
Got a lot of turds.

49:59.920 --> 50:03.840
I got a big shipment at the butt factory.

50:04.400 --> 50:05.600
I say you lean into it.

50:05.600 --> 50:09.040
If there's a trough you go to where two guys are already shoulder to shoulder and just

50:09.040 --> 50:10.640
squeeze in between them.

50:10.640 --> 50:11.440
Can I get in here?

50:11.440 --> 50:12.640
Let me just, excuse me.

50:12.640 --> 50:14.000
Can I just get in here?

50:14.000 --> 50:15.680
If you just crook your elbow I'll pee through it.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.040
Or yeah you do a double.

50:17.040 --> 50:20.720
If you got enough blast power they only need to split apart like a quarter inch for you

50:20.720 --> 50:21.440
to have clearance.

50:21.440 --> 50:21.920
You stagger.

50:21.920 --> 50:22.560
You gotta stagger.

50:22.560 --> 50:23.840
You do a stagger situation.

50:23.840 --> 50:25.840
Hey can we get to staggering here guys please?

50:25.840 --> 50:28.080
You're just stacking us off the shoulder.

50:28.080 --> 50:29.600
We don't need to be shoulder to shoulder.

50:29.600 --> 50:31.360
You can be off the shoulder as long as there's a gap.

50:31.360 --> 50:34.240
Can you two cross swords so I can get up in here please?

50:34.240 --> 50:34.720
I said.

50:34.720 --> 50:35.920
I want to three musketeers with y'all.

50:35.920 --> 50:40.240
As long as there's no, as long as there's no line, pee in the stall.

50:40.240 --> 50:40.480
Yeah.

50:40.480 --> 50:41.600
You're psyching yourself.

50:41.600 --> 50:45.680
Like you're not going to walk out of the stall and see a dude with a clipboard putting

50:45.680 --> 50:47.120
an X next to your name be like.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.200
Like no one's judging your shit.

50:49.200 --> 50:50.240
Another shit huh?

50:50.240 --> 50:50.560
Weird.

50:50.560 --> 50:54.000
Sounds like the worst one today.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.360
Can I ask you guys a question about this?

50:55.360 --> 50:57.120
This is related to this topic.

50:57.120 --> 51:04.560
If you go to a place and see a handicapped restroom, isn't it hard to deny yourself

51:05.200 --> 51:06.640
the spacious luxury?

51:06.640 --> 51:09.200
This really spread out.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.120
Maybe put down a picnic lunch.

51:12.320 --> 51:13.280
It's really hot.

51:13.280 --> 51:14.960
Like I mean I feel guilty about it.

51:14.960 --> 51:15.600
Coming to my studio.

51:15.600 --> 51:19.200
I kind of wish there was a thing, there was a special knock you could do

51:19.200 --> 51:24.720
if you were a person with disabilities that like, hey, I'm really, can you please?

51:24.720 --> 51:27.440
And I would, I would respect that instantly.

51:27.440 --> 51:29.360
I would be, I could be mid pinch.

51:29.360 --> 51:29.840
I'll pinch it off.

51:29.840 --> 51:31.360
Justin, I know a lot about you.

51:31.360 --> 51:34.800
If anyone knocked on a stall door, I think you would respect it instantly.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.720
Yeah, but no, if it was the special knock.

51:36.720 --> 51:40.320
Otherwise I just think they're an asshole or that guy from Cracker Barrel that one time.

51:40.320 --> 51:46.080
I once, I once walked into a bathroom and it had dividers betwixt the urinals and they

51:46.080 --> 51:48.160
were about three inches wide.

51:48.160 --> 51:50.880
So like they stuck out from the wall about three inches.

51:50.880 --> 51:52.560
It was like, it was a mockery.

51:52.560 --> 51:55.440
It was if to say we could have, but we didn't.

51:56.320 --> 51:57.520
We spent resources.

51:57.520 --> 52:02.720
I can't you, don't you hate when there's like an inch and a half or two inches of space?

52:02.720 --> 52:10.320
Like I don't, why do you as a bathroom door manufacturer hang those up and say, well,

52:10.320 --> 52:11.840
that's a good day's work.

52:11.840 --> 52:17.280
I've done the one thing that I'm supposed to do and protect people's situations.

52:17.280 --> 52:20.400
No, wait, there's a nice little staring crevice right here.

52:20.400 --> 52:21.520
Just to let people peep in.

52:22.560 --> 52:23.280
That's fine.

52:23.280 --> 52:28.480
I was using, I was using a stall one time and in the like wall between the two stalls,

52:28.480 --> 52:32.400
somebody had made like a hole to I guess look through and it was like, I don't know why you

52:32.400 --> 52:37.360
made like a little secret, like a, like a shadow box display, like a little diorama.

52:37.360 --> 52:40.640
Like I'm, I don't want to see through that hole into like what the person in the other

52:40.640 --> 52:41.360
stalls doing.

52:41.360 --> 52:42.240
It was really curious.

52:42.240 --> 52:48.160
Don't, is it, you know, one of the worst things is when there is a little crack there and

52:48.160 --> 52:52.480
the door is closed and you think, did somebody just do this as a prank or is there really

52:52.480 --> 52:53.280
somebody in there?

52:53.280 --> 52:58.400
And you kind of do that very casual walk by side glance, see if you see some shoes or

52:58.400 --> 52:59.680
maybe some rumpled pants.

52:59.680 --> 53:01.120
That's for real.

53:01.120 --> 53:04.080
And then all of a sudden you're the crackle, cracker barrel man.

53:04.960 --> 53:06.640
You're the man from the barrel.

53:07.200 --> 53:07.700
Yes.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.560
So that is how bathrooms work.

53:10.560 --> 53:14.000
Another episode of boy school in the can.

53:14.000 --> 53:20.240
Which is our side, our side project of bathroom etiquette for children.

53:22.240 --> 53:23.200
So that's it.

53:23.200 --> 53:23.840
So that's it.

53:23.840 --> 53:24.400
We're done.

53:24.880 --> 53:26.000
We're done with the show.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.680
Thanks for listening to our show.

53:28.160 --> 53:29.920
Another show we're going to make this week.

53:29.920 --> 53:30.720
You're going to get a boat.

53:30.720 --> 53:36.880
This is not the only episode of my brother, my brother and me that you will get to enjoy

53:37.600 --> 53:38.160
this week.

53:38.160 --> 53:39.120
What does he mean?

53:39.120 --> 53:39.680
I'll tell you.

53:39.680 --> 53:40.800
Boy school.

53:40.800 --> 53:50.960
We're going to make a very special episode just about to Tino's the entire to Tino's line

53:50.960 --> 53:52.880
is going to get the big feature.

53:53.520 --> 53:59.920
It's going to be a huge episode full of fun, full of flavor and full of flavor and full

53:59.920 --> 54:00.640
of crunching.

54:00.640 --> 54:04.080
And it's going to be a to Tino's episode from us to you.

54:04.080 --> 54:08.960
And it's going to be a to Tino's episode from us to you and the fine people to Tino's.

54:08.960 --> 54:14.000
If you want to get in on the action, email us with to Tino's in the subject line.

54:14.720 --> 54:21.200
And also, please tweet at to Tino's with the hashtag NB NBAM to Tino's and I can't.

54:22.560 --> 54:26.960
I'm not just going to say this because they are sponsoring the episode and because I love

54:26.960 --> 54:27.920
to Tino's.

54:27.920 --> 54:31.600
You should go get yourself some pizza rolls before you listen.

54:31.600 --> 54:32.240
Oh, yeah.

54:32.240 --> 54:34.480
This is the we're going to talk about them so much.

54:34.480 --> 54:37.040
You're going to lose your mind dying for them.

54:37.600 --> 54:42.880
We're going to be timing it out so that we are eating discreet meals during the show.

54:42.880 --> 54:46.720
So a lot of crunch and munch, a lot of gushing, a lot of yummy noises.

54:48.640 --> 54:49.760
It will be at my breakfast.

54:49.760 --> 54:51.440
It will be Travis's breakfast.

54:51.440 --> 54:52.160
It'll be my brunch.

54:52.160 --> 54:53.280
It'll be Justin's lunch.

54:54.080 --> 54:55.680
It's going to be one for the ages.

54:56.320 --> 55:01.360
Not the way you're listening a breakfast pizza roll with maybe like some sausage and

55:01.360 --> 55:02.640
cheese and egg.

55:02.640 --> 55:03.120
That's good.

55:03.120 --> 55:05.920
Just step into their house and tell them how to rearrange the furniture.

55:05.920 --> 55:09.440
I've already been I've been I pitched dessert pizza rolls to them that were maybe like an

55:09.440 --> 55:13.840
apple pie filling or like maybe like a hot chocolate custard kind of thing.

55:14.480 --> 55:16.160
It's going to get real real with Tino's.

55:16.160 --> 55:17.520
Do we have a date on that yet today?

55:17.520 --> 55:18.000
Twenty seconds.

55:18.000 --> 55:18.640
Twenty seconds.

55:18.640 --> 55:20.000
Twenty seconds coming Wednesday.

55:20.640 --> 55:24.320
This is not like the new my bim bam.

55:24.320 --> 55:26.400
Like that's not like special occasion.

55:26.400 --> 55:29.120
Do only sponsor says a special occasion.

55:29.120 --> 55:33.120
Justin Joe Justin joked about it on the show like three years ago.

55:33.120 --> 55:33.920
And then Mr.

55:33.920 --> 55:37.760
Totino heard it and was like, let's make it happen.

55:37.760 --> 55:38.480
That's what he sounds like.

55:38.480 --> 55:40.480
Do it like these boys.

55:40.480 --> 55:42.000
Let's get a good sound.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.680
Let's get these boys to hawk our little pockets of flavor.

55:47.360 --> 55:48.560
Let's sort them up.

55:48.560 --> 55:51.280
Sheila Sheila, send them to source.

55:53.280 --> 55:53.920
I'm Mr.

55:53.920 --> 55:54.400
Big Head.

55:55.120 --> 55:56.080
Oh, baby.

55:56.080 --> 55:56.960
Oh, baby.

55:56.960 --> 55:58.080
Oh, baby.

55:58.080 --> 56:01.360
Tito's is run by the bad guy from Sewer Shark.

56:01.360 --> 56:05.280
Apparently we're going to have these boys slinging sauce.

56:05.280 --> 56:06.960
I want to see saucy mouths.

56:08.400 --> 56:13.200
I want to see smooth smooth tan legs and saucy mouths.

56:13.200 --> 56:14.640
Get some sauce in their hair.

56:14.640 --> 56:17.520
Sheila make it look like they're having a real pizza party.

56:18.880 --> 56:21.360
I want no crying in pizza rolls.

56:24.560 --> 56:26.640
So that's going to be going to be doing some live show.

56:26.640 --> 56:31.920
Yeah, that's Pacific Northwest, Seattle, Vancouver.

56:31.920 --> 56:38.400
Go to bit.ly forward slash NB NB am Seattle or bit.ly forward slash van NB NB am.

56:38.400 --> 56:44.720
And you can buy tickets to those so you can come see us and enjoy those shows.

56:44.720 --> 56:47.120
Tickets are still selling fast.

56:47.120 --> 56:48.800
Those are reserved seats.

56:48.800 --> 56:53.440
So if you think you might want to come, please buy your tickets now.

56:53.440 --> 56:57.760
And a portion of every one of those tickets does go to us.

56:58.640 --> 57:00.480
So we get some we get the money.

57:00.480 --> 57:02.640
So I appreciate that for you buying it.

57:02.640 --> 57:03.040
Thank you.

57:03.840 --> 57:04.720
Thank you very much.

57:04.720 --> 57:07.440
You should listen to all the other amazing maximum fun shows.

57:08.160 --> 57:12.000
And the donor swap episode that everybody was promised.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.240
Wait, are we are we promoting these?

57:14.240 --> 57:20.080
We can't we can't announce who it is, but only that it's going to be fantastic.

57:20.080 --> 57:21.360
It's going to be amazing.

57:21.360 --> 57:23.840
Also, my sister, my sister, me is still in the works.

57:23.840 --> 57:26.080
So people have been asking a lot about that, that he's coming.

57:26.080 --> 57:28.880
But for right now, go check out the other maximum fun shows.

57:30.160 --> 57:31.600
And they're all incredible.

57:31.600 --> 57:33.360
I mean, they're countless good shows.

57:33.360 --> 57:34.880
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

57:34.880 --> 57:39.760
But maybe the other ones that were on Adventure Zone, Sawbones, Bunker Buddies.

57:41.440 --> 57:44.160
Yeah, can I just take a second to promote Monster Factory?

57:44.160 --> 57:46.720
It's a video series that Justin and I have been doing for Polygon.

57:46.720 --> 57:54.400
And I wouldn't normally plug shit on this show that is sort of outside the scope of the maximum fun community.

57:54.400 --> 57:57.840
But I've seen so many tweets from people who listen to the show.

57:57.840 --> 57:59.520
They're like, have you seen this video?

57:59.520 --> 58:00.720
And they haven't seen it.

58:00.720 --> 58:03.040
So it's called Monster Factory and it's on YouTube.

58:03.040 --> 58:04.640
Each one's like a half hour long.

58:04.640 --> 58:06.320
And I think they're really funny.

58:06.960 --> 58:09.200
I'm not just saying this because I'm your guys brother.

58:09.200 --> 58:12.960
The Fallout 3 and the Mass Effect 2 is like the funniest.

58:12.960 --> 58:14.960
The Mass Effect 2 turned out super good.

58:14.960 --> 58:18.080
Anyway, you can find that all on Polygon's YouTube channel.

58:18.080 --> 58:21.040
There's like a playlist of Monster Factory videos.

58:21.040 --> 58:22.960
You can just search Monster Factory on YouTube.

58:24.720 --> 58:28.240
You should also check out another YouTube series called Things I Bought at Sheets.

58:29.120 --> 58:35.040
Justin's hit YouTube series with his friend Dwight where they review items that Justin bought at Sheets.

58:35.040 --> 58:35.920
It's so good.

58:35.920 --> 58:36.400
So good.

58:36.400 --> 58:38.160
And we just figured out how to work a green screen.

58:38.160 --> 58:39.120
So that series is really going to be fun.

58:39.120 --> 58:40.800
Oh, hell yes.

58:40.800 --> 58:43.520
Also, Travis has a new podcast called Trends Like These.

58:43.520 --> 58:45.120
It does with his friend Brent.

58:45.120 --> 58:46.080
That's a...

58:46.080 --> 58:47.200
It's a must listen.

58:47.200 --> 58:49.040
It'll get your day started right.

58:49.040 --> 58:51.360
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song

58:51.360 --> 58:53.120
and to departure off the album putting the days to bed.

58:53.760 --> 58:54.960
You can still vote for him.

58:54.960 --> 58:58.400
If you live in Seattle, you should absolutely look up his platform.

58:58.400 --> 58:59.440
I think it's solid.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.360
And think about voting for him.

59:01.360 --> 59:03.440
You can early vote now for the primary.

59:03.440 --> 59:05.360
But get those votes in by August 4th.

59:06.160 --> 59:08.560
We got to hang out with him a lot at Max Fun Con.

59:08.560 --> 59:12.240
And he's a super good dude.

59:12.240 --> 59:14.720
And I think he would make a really great representative

59:14.720 --> 59:17.680
for the 8th district of Seattle.

59:17.680 --> 59:18.720
So if you live-

59:18.720 --> 59:19.840
Not the 9th or the 7th.

59:19.840 --> 59:21.200
That would be like a bad fit.

59:21.200 --> 59:21.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:22.800 --> 59:26.400
But so yeah, go look up his platform.

59:26.400 --> 59:27.040
Give it a thought.

59:28.000 --> 59:28.240
Yeah.

59:29.600 --> 59:31.120
We'll see you guys again on Wednesday.

59:31.120 --> 59:34.080
We'll see you in a couple days with mouths full of sauce.

59:34.640 --> 59:38.160
His final Yahoo answer was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

59:38.720 --> 59:40.320
Thank you, Zoe, climbing that ladder.

59:40.320 --> 59:40.800
Thank you.

59:43.760 --> 59:46.320
Let's call her Roseanne.

59:47.200 --> 59:52.560
Roseanne asks, do they make Rob Schneider dolls?

59:58.320 --> 59:59.280

59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.480
May I kiss your dad?

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:11.200
May I kiss your grandma?

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:32.640
If there's one thing I know about owls, they are wise.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.040
Two things.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:33.920
They are wise.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.480
Yes.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.280
They love nightclubs.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.080
They wear tiny graduation motorboards

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.680
and they love nightclubs.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.080
They also do the best double takes of all birds of prey.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.080
And if you slow it down, they actually go.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.640
International Waters, a panel show where US and UK comedians

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.800
battle for pop culture supremacy.
