00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:34.000
If you change your mind on the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take your chance on me If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

00:34.000 --> 00:44.000
If you got no place to go when you're feeling down If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
Finally, just ten days in, the year can start. It's my brother and my brother and me, the advice show for the modern era.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Finally kicking off 2011, a belated start to the year.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
New Year's Eve is technically, well, yesterday. Today is New Year's Day. It's time for New Year.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
We're on a different calendar than most people.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah, that Gregorian shit is bullshit.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
No, no, no, no. We're on the Gregory Hines calendar.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
What's that mean?

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
Gregory Hines came to me tap dancing in a dream. It was him and the other gentleman with the braids.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Ben Farine?

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
Ben Farine. No, yes. Ben Farine and Gregory Hines came to me in a dream and they said,

01:28.000 --> 01:37.000
Son, New Year's starts on the date your people currently refer to as January 10th.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
I mean, it's a dream.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
You gotta do what happens in a dream. Everyone knows that.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah, especially if Gregory Hines is up in the mix.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
If Gregory Hines comes in, his charm cannot be contained by the ethereal realm.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
His first show in 2011 started out really weird.

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
A weird my brother and my brother and me. What will they say?

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
So let's get into it. My name is Justin McElroy.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
And we're going to take your questions and turn them into wisdom.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
You're welcome.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
You're welcome in advance.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Should we apologize for skipping a week?

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
You know what my New Year's resolution is?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Tell me.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
No more apologizing.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
No more apologizing. Live without apologies and think of all the time you'll save that you could be doing nice things.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
I know.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
I know a lot of people trying to make it up to them. Here we go.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
What are some ways to get my shit right in the New Year?

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
This is appropriate other than the usual get fit or quit smoking or quit being cripply anti-social.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
Also, what are some tips to stick with it and accomplish set goals instead of burning out halfway through February?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Oh, lethargic Leviticus.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I have a great answer for that.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Hit me.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Don't set specific goals.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Set large general goals like this year, I am going to take better care of myself.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
This year, I am going to be more outgoing.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
This year, I am going to be more adult.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
So that way, oh, you can look back over the course of the year and say, you know, all in all, I did pretty good.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
If you set something specific like this year, I'm going to run every day.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
Well, then it only takes one day that you've broken that that resolution.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
What if you did like a contract with allowances, right?

03:31.000 --> 03:39.000
So you could say, I'm going to run every day with allowance to skip one day every four days.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
And then you don't have to do it.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
But if you do do it, then you can keep like the whole thing isn't isn't forfeit.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Yeah, that's the thing.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
You got to remember, this is a self-imposed restriction.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
Like there's no, you know, there's no like body of government over your resolution.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
So you're going to fail.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
No, that's legally binding.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Travis, legally binding.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Oh, God.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah, I know.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
What do you think state legislators do all day?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
They don't they don't write laws.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
That's up to the big boys.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
State legislators, they take people's new year's resolutions and they turn them into law law that that person has to then abide by.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
It's like you've never seen schoolhouse rock.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Try to keep up.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
I feel cool.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
I'm doing a new thing this year where I I make it's called an incremental resolution.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
I just resolve to make things a little better.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
And what you do is each day you make one less shitty choice than you did yesterday.

04:28.000 --> 04:36.000
So like today, today, yesterday, I ate like crap, but I rode my exercise bike today.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I didn't ride the exercise bike.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
So I had some granola for breakfast.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
It's like nice.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
You built.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
So you have a policy of canceling yourself out.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yes.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
My policy is.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
That's pretty good.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
If you want to be back to point zero at the end of the year, like just above you.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
I just want to hover around the same baseline.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
What if you made a resolution to ride your bike once this year?

04:58.000 --> 05:08.000
I think through happenstance, you'll end up on a bike like even maybe in some sort of wacky escape scenario where you're like going through a big pile of watermelons, you know, leaping over it to escape.

05:08.000 --> 05:15.000
The feds are trying to chase you down for writing that fake blank check for a million dollars to yourself because that goon hit your bike with a car.

05:15.000 --> 05:26.000
So I think what you're saying is also this year, 2011, your resolutions either need to be really general or incredibly minutely specific.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Right, right.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
This year I wear a red sock.

05:29.000 --> 05:39.000
I've been eating a multivitamin every morning with my breakfast, which is now a banana and a plain bagel with cream cheese and a glass of orange juice and one multivitamin.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
And I have to say, I feel like a million bucks.

05:41.000 --> 05:51.000
I don't I don't eat super healthy, so it's like a supplementary vitamin for like people like me who, you know, maybe can't can't climb all the steps of the food pyramid.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
They get hung up at the bottom and they jump right up to sugars and fats to build their home there.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
And I gotta say, I feel great.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I feel more limber.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
My bones don't ache as much anymore.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
The scurvy is cleaned up.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I'm growing a beard now, too.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
It's got a nice sheen on my cheeks.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I would almost bet that's not true.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
I've resolved this year my my New Year's resolution.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
And it's something I mean, I've gotten complaints about it mostly in my workplace, in my personal life.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
And so I've decided it's time to finally take care of it.

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
And I'm going to I'm going to try to cut back or stop altogether on trying to throw it off to ludicrous.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
That is so important.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
You know, we tend to rely on that, I think, in our modern day society.

06:35.000 --> 06:44.000
Our listeners don't don't don't get this because I edit the show with I go I have to go through with a fine tooth comb to get all the times you try to throw it off to ludicrous.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah. And it's really like two or three times every minute.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah. I'm just like, Luda.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Yeah. And then the show just grinds to a halt.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
You point to the side, but like, we can't see you.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Yeah. We don't know what you're doing.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
And he just looks at me and goes, not this time.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Oh, God, it's frustrating.

07:02.000 --> 07:10.000
The straw that broke the camel's back. You have to like think that ludicrous is somewhere like remotely feeling you like he remotely feels you trying to trying to get.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
You've got to see him like nodding nodding his head like he's into the beat and he's ready to jump in there.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah. That straw that broke the camel's back was Travis tried that move in the boudoir in the bedroom.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Yeah. And it was.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Yeah. You don't want to try that with your lady.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
So let's get another question.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
I think we've I think we've answered that one pretty well.

07:30.000 --> 07:37.000
I if I try to talk to my best friend about serious stuff like goals or college job, etc.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
He just evades the questions and doesn't produce any opinion.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
How do I get him to acknowledge life beyond games, anime, Internet and pop culture?

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Help brothers. We could use your love.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Concerned hipster.

07:52.000 --> 08:03.000
Hmm. This is the most exciting time to be alive ever, I think, and we have the luxury of not worrying so much about the day to day.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
You know, there are people in third world countries who would love to be able to sit around and worry about games and anime and Internet and pop culture.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Maybe you just embrace it.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
Yeah, I I have a couple of friends where I know that that friendship is based on.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
We watch all the same TV shows and have read all the same books.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I mean, I don't need to constantly be hanging out with people going.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So what about that war in Iraq?

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
Like you could sometimes just talk about the Simpsons like that's completely OK.

08:30.000 --> 08:41.000
In fact, I find that people who try so hard to like force those conversations down my throat are typically not my good friends are typically the people that I I, you know, that yell things at me from park benches.

08:41.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah. So I think what you need to do is maybe just kind of take stock of what kind of friendship is this?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
And maybe you guys just don't have that.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
I'm having a terrible day kind of relationship.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
Maybe you just have I saw an awesome episode of Blank last night.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Let's talk about it.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Yeah, maybe you're his sometimes friend who he likes to talk about those things with.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
And maybe he has another friend that he talks about serious stuff with and you you should have that, too.

09:08.000 --> 09:21.000
Also, like, that's not really stuff, especially as you get older and and your your social dynamic starts to change, I don't think friends are like the people you always want to talk to about that stuff.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
Like dump that stuff on your on your on your loved one, you know, your friends, your friends.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
You should be all about partying down, getting totally crazy.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
Mm hmm. Getting get bananas, you know, to get. What if you just flipped it on him, though? Whoa.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
What if you just flipped it? Like, what if you're talking about the latest anime that you guys watched on a man?

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
I believe it's on me on a man up here on a mom.

09:48.000 --> 09:58.000
What if you were watching, you know, one of your cartoons and like you just say all of a sudden you're just like an enemy.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
I hate you both so much. Yahoo Answers.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
We're your enemies now, right? Enemies. Yes.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
But hey, it's the first Yahoo answer of the new year.

10:11.000 --> 10:20.000
This is a cinema by Cal. I'm not going to go on until both of you stop.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
I'm sorry, Griffin. I'm sorry. Please go on. I know this game.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
Yahoo Answers user Mr. Lizard needs to know. Are you pronouncing that right?

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
Yep. I think it's I know because there's a picture of a lizard company.

10:35.000 --> 10:44.000
He asks, Do I need to wear pants under my snuggie blanket when I wear it to work on casual Friday?

10:44.000 --> 10:51.000
The infomercial shows druid like people wearing them to sporting events and around a campfire, but it's not clear what to wear underneath.

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
Also, any ideas to accessorize the snuggie? I have access to a bedazzler.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
Well, yes, obviously, that's a step that you should take.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
They send a free one with your snuggie. Hey, why don't you bedazzle? You're just gonna be around the house.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah. Yeah. It would be irresponsible for you not to bedazzle that shit.

11:11.000 --> 11:19.000
Yeah. I think I think snuggies should be like vampires in that if they touch sunlight, they should burst into flames instantly.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
They should. You should never wear a snuggie out of the house ever, ever, ever, ever.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
If you do that, you're done. Like, that's it. You're done.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
Unless unless you get invited to a party that specifically is listed as snuggie formal.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
Like a snuggie party. I could get down with that. Yeah, like a snuggie party.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Sometimes, like, I get too drunk at a party. I just want to go to sleep.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Snuggies like a bed that you walk around in.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
Like, that sounds great. And if you've never been to a snuggie orgy, that shit's awesome.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
Oh, man. And it's very safe, too. Yeah, so safe. Because there's no flaps in the front.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
Well, there's no flaps. There's actually zero genital to genital contact at all.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
A lot of static electricity, though. A lot of sparks flying.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
Which reminds me, if you're looking for the perfect way to accessorize your snuggie, how about dick hole?

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
A bedazzled dick hole.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Who's that peeping at you through the window?

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
Oh, he looks as snuggly as the snuggie. Get up. I'm not a snuggie for your penis.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
This is a snuggie attached to the...

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
See, this is tricky territory because... Hey, does that feel good to you, baby?

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
It feels tartany, actually. It feels like a tartan. Is there a tartan down there?

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Whatever size your snuggie dick hole is, people are going to be able to tell.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Like, they'll be able to eyeball your dick, even when it's not hanging out.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
They can see your snuggie bedazzled dick hole and can just work it out, can figure it out.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
So, I don't know. Maybe if you're secure in your...

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
You could just bedazzle the words, not much, over the penis hole.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
Look elsewhere. And you know what the great thing about that is?

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
If you turn it around, you're in for the snuggliest bowel movement of your life.

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
Just get your aim right. Get your line up right. I cannot stress this enough.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
Get your line up right, because that will be the end of your snuggie party.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Oh, that snuggie's done. Burn that snuggie.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
You should have burned it anyway, because you wore it out of the house.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
But now burn it, like, officially now. Definitely now.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
I don't know. Maybe it would be... Maybe snuggies are the jam. I've never worn one.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
I feel like... I'd be careful playing with fire. You put one of those on.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
I like blankets. I know, me too. I like robes.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
You should test it out. Just get a robe and put it on backwards and see...

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Just take it for a test drive. You think? Yeah.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
Can we stop the show for a second? Let me... Yeah, just go put one on and see...

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I'm doing it right now.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
I think that snuggie is, like, moving to your retirement community,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
because once you do it, you're done. That's it.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
You're not going to do anything else. That's it. You're done. You're out.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
And also, every conversation is always going to end as soon as you say the words,

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
you know, I own a snuggie, and nope, you're done. You're out of that conversation.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
It's a secret shame. You've got to keep it to yourself.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
I have been seeing an amazing girl for around a month, Griffin,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
and we recently made it official... Now, wait a second.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
That is in the email. I swear to God.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
We recently made it official that we are dating.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
I really can't say enough good things about her, how she makes me feel.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
I know she loves... She feels the same way,

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
and she's often told me that she can see herself falling for me.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
This is all brand new to me. I've never had this deep of a connection with a woman,

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
and I find myself wanting to tell her that I love her.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
I know after only a month, this isn't the best thing to do,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
and I don't want to scare her off,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
but I need to get the wisdom of the three brothers on this topic.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
What is it okay to say, I love you, to your S.O.?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
You guys have fun with this one?

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
I'm going to go buy, like, nine or ten snuggies.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
This question, nine or ten snuggies, depressed me.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
On a scale of one to ten snuggies.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
How depressed are you?

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
This is my girlfriend, Darlene. I made her out of snuggies.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
She's super cuddly, and different colors.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Matt, I am so familiar with your situation right now

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
that halfway through your question, I wanted to start Googling you

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
and trying to find out how I can contact you to tell you to stop

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
the terrible thing you're about to do.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
This is one of those things that, the trick of it,

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
the problem of it is, there is no right time.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
You got to feel it out, and that shit is hard as shit.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Like, there is no, there's no light bulb,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
or she's not going to look at you and say,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
you should tell me you love me now.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Yeah, I'm ready. Give it, hit me with that.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
It's just not going to happen.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
It's the kind of thing, as you're stumbling along

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
in this darkness of life, you have to figure it out

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
on your own, and it's terrifying.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Matt, words are easy.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Words, words, you can open your mouth,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
and they slip out, and whatever.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
What I would say is, actions are the difficult,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
more meaningful thing.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
So don't say the words until you find yourself acting like it.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
When you find yourself putting her before yourself,

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
acting in such a way that is, where she is in your mind

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
when you're making your decisions,

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
that is acting like you love somebody.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
And that's the more important thing.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
And don't say the words until you find yourself acting that way.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Words are easy.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
We exist in a society that throws around the word love a lot.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
I love baseball, I love my friends, I love my dog.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
So it is through actions.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
Also, I would suggest waiting until it's not that you want to say

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
I love you, but that you need to say I love you.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
That you look at her, and it's like, I can't not say it.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
I am so overwhelmed in this moment with feelings for you

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
that I have to say this thing.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
God, this is some pussy shit you guys are talking about.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
And the emotions are like a big egg in your chest,

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
and it just breaks open, and the love comes out your mouth.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
Griffin has a bad idea of romance and biology.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Griffin's flipped on us, and he's become a love Scrooge.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Just like that.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
He no longer believes in the miracle.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
It's just BS.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
I'll tell anybody I love them, but I won't say that I'm in love with them,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
because that's a whole other tier.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
That's a whole other tier.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
T-I-E-R-N-T-E-R.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
You're shitting on us for semantics, is that what I'm talking about?

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
It's not semantics, that's fucking, that's some shit.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
And so that way, when you break up with her, you can say,

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
listen, I know how it sounded, but technically,

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
I never said I was in love with you, so I'm scot-free.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Yeah, you see people making fun of that, but I hear somebody say,

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
I love you, but I'm not in love with you.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Yeah, totes. That's a different thing.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
That's a different thing.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
That's two different things.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
It's like, I'm hungry and I'm sad.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Those are two different things.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Matt, save it for when you need to rescue the relationship.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Save that card.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
There's no reason to just burn that one.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Maybe you made out with one of her friends.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
What if you don't fuck that bad?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
It's bad.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
That is one get-out-of-jail-free card

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
you do not want to deploy unless you need to.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
But it is important that you don't say it like this.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
I love you?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
That never goes over well.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Don't make it a question.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Another way not to say it.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
I love you.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
You don't want to make yourself the only person.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
That's going to build a dependency.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Don't whisper it, either, if it's your first time.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
If you're going to do it, just do it.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Don't whisper it.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Skywriting.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Don't say it unless you're at a jumbotron.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
If there's a jumbotron on the two of you, then say it.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
You're not going to have a choice in the matter

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
of what you say to you, and you won't be able to control

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
the love and your love output.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
Griffin, you're going to be visited by three ghosts tonight.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
The first...

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
My chains.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
My chains are so big.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Metaphorical and literal.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
He's going to be visited by the ghost

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
of John Cusack.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
My name is Mike,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
and my wife's name is Darlene.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
She's made of Snuggies.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
She's made of Snuggies.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
She's also Mike and Darlene,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
and her brother's name, Mike.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Wait for it.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
She wants to name our kids Mike and Darlene,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
but I think it's a bad idea.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Am I overreacting?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
He didn't sign it, but I'm going to guess it's Mike.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Hey, Mike.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
That's a wicked bad idea.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Yeah.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
His full name is Mike Mike Darlene.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Hi, I'm Darlene Micerson.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
The third.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
This is my brother, Mike.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
His sister, Darlene.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
And our dog, Mark.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah, it's hard

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
family reunions.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Somebody says Mike in the whole house just burns down.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
What?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Who? What?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
What if every Mike you've ever known

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
is in this, like, up in the mix, up in this family?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
What if this is like some sort of,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I don't know, some sort of legacy?

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Or a cult.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Griffin, listen.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I know this is weird to say

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
at this time.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
It's the holidays and everything, but I have to tell you something.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Okay.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I saw Mike making out with Darlene.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
No.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
No, no.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
That's either incest or adultery.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
No, I saw Mike making out with Darlene.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Don't do that.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Don't do that.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
What are you overreacting?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
You are underreacting if you're

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
taking the time to write to us instead of

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
filing divorce proceedings.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
There's no way.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
There's no way that that conversation doesn't go like this.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Fuck it.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Let's just call him Mike and Darlene.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Like, there's no way it was like a

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
coincidence that you came up with those names.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
It's so much deeper than this because you're assuming that everybody in this situation

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
had a choice of what the next

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
generation of people's names are going to be, right?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
So Mike and Darlene are either the

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
parents of Mike or Darlene,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
but whoever that child was

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
had to go out in the world and find another person

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
named Mike and Darlene that they can marry.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
They're getting a fucking name monopoly.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Yeah.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah, I've played it.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Listen, guys.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
This is bad, Mike.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
If we can call you Mike.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Why don't you suggest

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
naming the boy Darlene and the girl Mike?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I love it.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Tell me that's the only condition under which you'll accept it.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Mike is

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
M-Y-K-E

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
E

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
and Darlene

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
you spell M-I-K-E.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
It's pronounced Darlene.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It's pronounced Darlene.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
There's a silent Mike

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
and an invisible

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Darlene in there.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
You know, silent Mike and invisible Darlene

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
are my favorite new rap duo of 2010.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Did you hear their new album?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
It was an EP. It was a very limited release, but it was really good.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
You could only buy it if your name was Mike or Darlene.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Hey, I have a Yahoo answer.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Hey, in short, Mike, get out.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Go ahead, Griffin.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
This one was sent in by Jenna Dar.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Thank you, Jenna.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user IcedTeaLemonFry.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Who says?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
There's a lot going on there.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Is it dangerous

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
to get a hickey

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
right above the heart?

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
My best friend and I wish to give each other

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
a hickey right above where the heart is placed.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Would this cause any sort of damage

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
to the blood circulation around there?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Or any type of damage to our bodies?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Sorry if this sounds foolish,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
but I care for them so much

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
and wouldn't want to place their life in any sort of danger.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
I like how they just casually throw out

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
the weirdest part of that question.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Yeah.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
It's just me and my buddy.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
We're just sitting around playing hickey games, you know?

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Oh, God.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Hickey tag.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
It's just some hickeys between friends.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
What?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Listen, I love the idea that you and I have had

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
of sucking on each other's chest muscles

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
until a hickey develops, but I need to ask

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Yahoo Answers to see if that's going to do some detrimental harm.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I've got the shivers.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Yeah, it's bad, right?

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
There's a lot of, like, when you're doing that,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
first of all, don't

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
put your mouth there.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Second,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
do you know the proximity of

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
my heart to my armpit?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
How many mouths I want down there?

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Zero mouths.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Yeah, I don't care.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Boyfriend, girlfriend,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
just keep your mouth away from there. I'm ticklish.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Yeah, and just to clear up,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I don't care if these two friends

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
are a man and a man, a woman and a woman,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
or a man and a woman.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
It doesn't matter. It's creepy as shit.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
What are you doing?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
What are you doing? Stop that.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Put it down.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
How is that even an idea that comes up?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Oh, I'm bored. Do you want to watch

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
another episode of Daria? No, fuck it.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Just put it right above my heart.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Until a bruise develops.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Do they mean above my heart?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Like, the

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
skin that covers the heart?

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
You mean like, aorta?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Or like, right above?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Yeah, right. The aorta skin.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Hey, iced tea lemon fry. Aorta not do that.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Hey, if there was a top 40

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
song

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
on the charts called Hickey on My Heart,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
who would have written it? Justin Bieber.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
See, that's where I went to.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Maybe Justin Bieber, maybe Avril Lavigne.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Or maybe like a Toby Keith, because it could be like a country

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
standard.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Yeah, maybe John Michael Montgomery

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
would write a song called Hickey on My Heart.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Yeah, by the way, title of this episode,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
we found it.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
The danger would be

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
if sucking on your friend's chest

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
until it gave me Hickey didn't kill him.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
That's the only thing that I'm worried about at this point.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
And then, secondary danger,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
if anyone noticed.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Yeah.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
What the fuck is that on your chest?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
No, it's okay. I have a matching one, Mom.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Oh, okay. This is my good friend

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Douglas. I like him very much.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
We are friends.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
What if the vacuum

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
effect, like, pulls a little bit of

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
armpit in your mouth? That's like...

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
God, that's the...

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
What if your aim is off, and you pull

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
up, and you got a nipple in your mouth?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Oh.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Well, now you're married.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I'm not saying that is how it works, Travis.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I'm not saying, like,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
you rip off their armpit. I'm saying, like,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I don't know what my armpit tastes like, but it can't be great.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Yeah.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
It can't be great.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Mine tastes like Lady Secret deodorant.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
It's strong enough for a man.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Mine tastes like stump. It's been a rough week.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
I don't want to talk about it.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Hey, guys.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I've been dating my girlfriend for almost

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
two years now, and I like her a lot.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
However, every time we start to take

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
a nap or go to bed, she wants

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
to talk instead of going to sleep.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Women. Women.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I do want to stop right here and say

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
normally I don't like to answer

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
questions from people who are living in

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
a sinful situation,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
but I am going to continue for this special case.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
She does the same thing

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
in the morning if she wakes

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
up before me. I'm pretty sure

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
killing her to shut the fuck up would be a bad idea.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Would it?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
So I need a good one. You're pretty

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
sure? I know communication

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
is key to any relationship,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
but sleeping is key to me

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
not being an asshole. Thanks,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
sleepy sugar daddy.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Well,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
the bad news is

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
you done waited too long.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
You've set a precedent now. You should

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
have said that right away.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
First time you guys spend the night together, and she wanted to talk

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
to you. She was like, no, I go sleepy

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
now, but now it's too late.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Now you just got to keep doing it for the

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
rest of your life. Unfortunately,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
if she says me go sleepy now, you are

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
dating a five-year-old,

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
and that's a crime.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
That is a crime.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
You should be in

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
jail for that.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
How about

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
just I have a big day tomorrow?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
He's got to have a big day every day, and she

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
knows that's not true.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
I'm an astronaut now.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Big news, honey. I'm an astronaut, and I need

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
to turn. What about this?

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Turn in a little earlier.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Just that way you can talk to her.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Spend some quality time

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
there, and then

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
and then

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
you can put something in her drink.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Oh, or you can go with

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Travis's method, which is always

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
comes up with the worst ideas. Put something

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
in a drink. That's a great idea. Travis

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
always like he makes like

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
antifreeze. You just make a jump to

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
felonious like with no provocation.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I am saying antifreeze.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Fucking kill her!

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Kill her, bury her in the yard! Yeah, get it!

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Sleep it!

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Sleep in the yard! Lord of the

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Flies! No rules!

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Why?

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
He's supposed to go to sleep because he's tired.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Hit her with a rock.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Hit her with a rock!

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
He tries to run to caveman,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
but he can sleep it.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Okay, caveman.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Listen, sleepy sugar daddy.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
When you're in

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
a relationship, you gotta meet her

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
halfway. Imagine this email

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
that we were to get. What if our next email

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
was from Talkative Terry

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
and she said,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I love my boyfriend so much

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
and I like to unwind at

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
night by talking to him, but every time

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
I try to tell him about my day and my deepest desires

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
and my secret fears,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
he goes to sleep.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
That hurts my feelings. How can I deal with that?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
See, you just gotta flip it.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
You're in a relationship now, dog. You gotta meet her halfway.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
You'll get your sleep. Don't you worry.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Let me give you some real advice that won't land you

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
in prison. Sit down to dinner

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
with her every night and talk about

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
her day then. You know, like,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
make a time when you're not trying to

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
sleep to actually speak to her. Talk her

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
fucking ear off. Yeah.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Then cut her ear off and sleep it!

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Sleep with her ear!

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Let me tell you this. Let me tell you this, sleepy

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
daddy. Just dump her.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I sleep like a king every night.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I sleep when I want. Like a lonely

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
lonely king. The only

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
person I sleep with is the

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Pizziz application in my phone.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Uh, pillow dampened

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
with tears.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Listen, let me

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
hit you with another idea.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Turn it on her.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
So if she starts talking,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
let her talk herself out and then

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
demand that she talk more.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
And just keep, like, play chicken with her.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
See who will fold. I guarantee you

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
she'll eventually say, listen, I

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
have to work tomorrow. I have to

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
go to sleep. And then you'll have won.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
And she doesn't want to get into that game with you every night.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
She knows. She knows what will happen if she starts

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
talking. You'll make her talk all

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
night. I think, I haven't

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
been in a relationship. That's a risk reward if I ever

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
heard it, but good luck. I haven't been in a relationship

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
in a long time, but if I remember correctly,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
the secret to a healthy relationship is

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
besting. Uh, is

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
besting your partner. Yeah. And

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
acts like this in a series of physical and mental

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
challenges. That's what that's what a relationship

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
is. Love is like double dare in more

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
ways than one. Because you

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
know what? You know what? It's

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
messy. Yeah, it is messy.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
And sometimes you gotta go elbow deep

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
to find the flag.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
What is Mark?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Summers is always there and Mark Summers is always

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
there watching in a cheap suit.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Sometimes. Sometimes you get a

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
trip. Sometimes you get a trip to Universal

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Studios. Sometimes you get gacked.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
No big deal.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
No biggie. Don't worry about it. Past the giant

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
waffle. Uh, I'm a Canadian

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
and I recently decided to pack my

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
bags and move away to America.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
But every time I go to the States,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I'm immediately singled out as being

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
the Canadian. Can you give me some

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
pointers on how to blend in with my new American

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
neighbors? Leaving the beaver,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
eh?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I gotta say something. Tell me.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I think Canadians are like royalty

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
in my mind. Anytime I meet someone

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
and they're like, oh I'm Canadian,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
my opinion of them is

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
just so high. I've never met a Canadian that

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I didn't like.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Yeah, I think we're past the point in

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
society where Canadians are

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
made fun of. I think you guys are doing

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
okay. Yeah, you're awesome. You guys have

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
the best movies, the best games, the best music.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
You guys are killing it up there.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
And you gave us Rick

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Moranis. Yeah.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
And you know, it's not the worst thing in the world

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
you know,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
you're moving to a new place.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
At least people have

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
something to remember you with. Like people

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
you'll make an impression on people. You're a Canadian person.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I don't know that many Canadian people. I would

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
remember if someone I knew was Canadian. And it's

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
a great starter to a conversation.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
You know, like someone hears

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
you say a boot or a and they're like,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
oh are you Canadian? Oh Travis, that's a

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
terrible stereotype. You're racist.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
They don't say a boot? No.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
They don't. Then can I say a boot?

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Yeah, you can say. You take it back.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Yay! Yay! You're reclaiming it.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Now burn it and smash it with a

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
hammer. Bury it in the lawn.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Yeah, there's someone who singles you

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
out as a Canadian.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Give them poison maple syrup

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
and then bury them

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
in the lawn. Like Travis, that's

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
I've never said that. You've

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
said it all the time.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
We have an important, like a public service

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
that I think the three of us should

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
stop and talk about.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
It is

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
a very important month this month.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Which by the way, I think

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
we should do this every month. Because every

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
month has some level of importance to it.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I don't know. I think we should start out in January

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
and just talk about and give people

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
some helpful tips. I'm sure you guys already know what we're talking

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
about. SeriousSam24

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
actually clued me into this. Twitter user

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
SeriousSam24. Thank you.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
It is

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
National Bath Safety Month.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Oh thank Jesus.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Yeah, I know. It seems like it was just last month.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
But no, it's January. Just like it is

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
every year. I

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
think that we should stop and maybe talk

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
a little bit about bath

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
safety and why it's so important.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Justin, I know you have

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
a presentation if you'd like to start it off.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Yeah, probably the first time

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
that I felt like an old person

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
was when I went to Lowe's

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
and I had to ask

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
the person in the vest

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
if they could point me to those.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
So I said, the strips that help

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
you not fall down.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Hey guys,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
don't laugh. Don't laugh. It's not funny.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
When you get to that point, like you get

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
to the point where

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
you are actively

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
considering the possibility that you could fall down

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
the tub and hit your head and not

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
get back up, you're really

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
embracing your own mortality.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Like that feeling of invincible

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
thing, that is kaputski.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
It's super important. What you're

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
saying is, it's very, very important, Justin.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I agree with that. But

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
that is technically for

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
shower safety month, and that is April.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
So everyone knows that

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
putting those things down in your bathtub ruins

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
it, ruins its capacity for bathing

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
because it's like sitting on football cleats

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
after that.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
You're more worried about those people that still

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
shower with electronics sitting around the tub.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Again, shower safety month

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
is April. We're talking about

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
pools of water that people soak in.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
So they bathe with electronics

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
sitting around the tub, or they bathe

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
whilst

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
trying to, I don't know,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
skin carrots or something.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
So you would say...

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Don't prepare food

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
in the bathtub. It's like you guys have

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
never given a public service announcement before.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
It's like playing poker with my sister's kids. Do you want me

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
to do one? Yeah.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Let me do one.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
A hundred people every year

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
get sucked down the drain.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Get fucking...

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
look sharp.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
See? That's all you needed.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
They can play that. They can syndicate that on the radio.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Oh, okay. Do you want to try again?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Yeah, let me try. I'll give it some...

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
So this would be like free publicity for us, right?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Yeah, totally.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
In fact, if you even want to say like our names or like the name

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
of the show, and then...

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Hey,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
you're falling asleep in the bathtub

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
and you're probably going to drown.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Wake up!

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
My brother, my brother, and me?

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Good, good, good, good. Was that good?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Uh-huh. Travis?

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
You know, it's all fun and games to relax

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
in the shower, but always

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
be vigilant for bathtub

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
sharks. My brother, my brother, and me.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
That's good.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I want to try again.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Edit that last one out. That wasn't good.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I will cut it out. They will cut it out.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
All right. I want to try one.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I don't have...

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I don't have a good one.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
God damn it, Justin.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
I'm sorry. I thought I had...

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
This is so difficult.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Six people just died in the bath because of you.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Yeah.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
They fell asleep because of

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
how boring and awful you are.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
All right. Here we go.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
If your fingers are pruney,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
that means it's the sin coming out.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Ask Jesus. I love you.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
My brother, my brother, and me?

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
What?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
That's brilliant. You just saved

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
some lives. That's good because it's got

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
a religious message, but also

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
remind people that earthly love is real,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
and it's mine.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
How about this? How about this?

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Okay.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
The temperature of your water shouldn't exceed

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
115 degrees, or else it'll

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
flake the flesh off of your bones.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
And your baby's bones.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
My brother, my brother, and me.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Hey, hey, hey.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Don't jerk off in the bathtub.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
That's awful. My brother, my brother, and me.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
That washes down the drain

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
and goes and mixes with everybody's water.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
And then you get somebody

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
pregnant and have to pay child support.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
My brother, my brother, and me.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
The water you're in right now

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
is like zero, zero, zero, zero,

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
zero, point, zero, zero, zero percent

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
cum.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Have a good bath.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
You'll never be clean again.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
My brother, my brother, and me.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Is that good?

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Have we done enough to help you think at this point?

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I feel like

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
maybe two or three more.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Do you have a Yahoo answer?

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
I feel like

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
we've informed people.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
There's just so much danger.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Bath safety, guys. Get on it.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
This one is sent in by Peter Baumgartner.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Thank you, Peter.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ed, who asks,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Is it possible to use chi

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
to make fire?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Is it possible to use your

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
chi energy to make fire?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I know it is possible to use chi energy

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
to make warmth and to control fire

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
pyrokinesis.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
But can you use it to make a little fire

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
on, for example, a piece of paper?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
A piece of paper? No.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
No.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
If you're using chi to make fireballs,

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
and I'm assuming

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
he's talking about fireballs.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Well, yes. You can't do it on paper.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
No, not paper.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Whenever I make my chi flames,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I usually just use it

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
to heat up food.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Yeah, sure. I use it to light dollar bills

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
on fire.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
What do I care? I can shoot mine fire.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Yeah, once you have your mine fire right,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
money is not an ish.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I can't tell you...

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I can't tell you the amount of times

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I've been sitting around creating warmth

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
and controlling fire with my chi

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
pyrokinesis.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And I've wondered, why can't

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I just create this fire?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
You know, and I've tried. God knows

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I've tried, but then I lose focus on

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
controlling the fire and it gets out of hand

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
and burns down a building.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Did I tell you guys last week? Oh my god.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I was channeling my chi energy

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
to make warmth and control fire, pyrokinesis.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
But I was wearing a

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Snuggie while I did it, and I almost burned

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
to death.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
I love that scene in Princess Bride

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
where Andre the Giant is wearing

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
a flaming Snuggie.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Holy shit!

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
He is, right?

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
He's like really doing that.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
The holocaust cloak is the world's earliest

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Snuggie.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
It's like you channeled your chi energy

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
to make warmth and summon Andre the Giant's ghost.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Pyrokinesis.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Pyro-con-Andre.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
The most powerful fours on Earth.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Hey.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Geomagnetism.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Hey Ed.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Hey Ed.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Listen, we've all been there.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Right? We've all been there.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
I was on safety patrol in elementary school

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
and there's nothing to do when you're standing

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
on the corner helping kids cross the street.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Except for, I guess, keep those kids alive.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
So I would try and move shit with my mind.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Sure. We all did.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
We're all there, but

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Ed, it's

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
2000 in heaven now.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Yeah. Science rules.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Science is cool and like

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
we have to rise above this.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Yeah. Get on board with science.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Science says you can't do that as much

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
as you'd like to.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I'm going to take a counterpoint here.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Science says we haven't done it yet.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Okay. Okay. Good.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
People also used to say that

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
man couldn't fly and that

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
the Earth was flat.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
And look what Columbus Daddy flew.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
So, yeah.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
So there, I mean, there you go.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Ed, listen.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I feel like we've been joking

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
for about a year now, but this is serious.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
If you are going

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
to channel your chi energy to make warmth

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
and control fire, pyrokinesis,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
you have

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
to, have, have to

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
make sure that you do

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
not do it in a bathtub.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
My brother made that up to me.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
It's so serious, so topical,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
so relevant.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
There were like six or seven callbacks in there.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Yeah. Did you hear them all? It was good.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
I'll go back with a crayon and circle them.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
This is from Weathered

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
in Cincinnati. He says, I got a corporate

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
job downtown

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
I got a corporate job in downtown Cincinnati

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
in July and I'm the youngest guy in the office

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
at 25 years old. People I work with

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
are all nice, but they're all older and I have

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
nothing in common with them. I've tried getting

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
interested in them, as Justin has advised me to do in the past,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
but it's hard to connect when I don't have kids

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
or a lousy husband slash wife

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
to complain about. Also, I'm pretty sure

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
everyone thinks I'm a meteorologist

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
because all I can think of to talk about is the weather.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Any topics or ways to start

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
a better conversation during my lunch hour would be

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
much appreciated. Thanks,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Weathered in Cincinnati.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
You can just hang out with me.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Just hang out with Travis. I do want to address

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
like a serious, like an actual point

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
here. You say, I've tried

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
getting interested in them, as Justin has advised

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
to do in the past, but it's hard to connect

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
when I don't have kids or a lousy

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
husband slash wife to complain about.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
It's kind of backwards.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
You've got it backwards.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
The bit

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
about like getting

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
interested in other people that we

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
harp on here, it's not about

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
finding things to talk about yourself

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
that you think the person will be interested in.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Yeah, it's not a conversation starter. You actually

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
have to do it.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
You have to do it. You have to say,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
there's nothing people love

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
more than telling you about something you

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
don't know about. You say,

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I don't have a

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
wife. That must be hard.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
What is that like?

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
And also, you're actually in a really

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
good spot there because people love that

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
and people hate when someone says

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
like, you think you've got it bad.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Let me tell you how bad. Everybody

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
hates that guy.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
It's wonderful to be the guy

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
like, I am a youngling who needs to learn.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Please teach me. And those

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
people will love you because they think you want to

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
actually listen to their stories all the time.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Just listen to them. And also,

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
I bet you're a fucking cool guy.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
You seem cool.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
You seem like a cool guy.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
They would be interested in you too.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
And the beautiful thing is, as a younger guy,

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
they're going to be interested in living

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
vicariously through you because all

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
of these older people are like,

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Jim went to a crazy club this weekend

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
because they couldn't go to a crazy club.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
They had a lousy wife, husband, and kids.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
So as you're talking about doing awesome

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
things, they're like, please tell me more about your awesome things.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
I used to work at Best Buy

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
with a guy named Blanks.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
And everyone called him Blanks

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
because they thought he looked like Billy Blanks

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
and I thought that they just didn't know many black people.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
But

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
the highlight of my Sunday

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
used to be hearing about whatever

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
whatever cool

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
club that Blanks had gone to the night

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
before that I didn't know existed.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
And the girl

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
he got down with

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
as he smoked his menthol cigarettes and told me

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
about his conquest, that was a highlight.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
And I didn't have anything in common with him.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I just liked hearing those stories.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
It would vicariously be awesome for a little bit.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Our world is a great big mosaic.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
People like

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
me and Justin Travis,

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
and people like Blanks, and people like

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
you, Weathered and Scentsy,

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
and people like you, the listener.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
And let's just share.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Let's just share our experiences

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
with each other without reservations.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Yeah, we don't need to

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
dump your stuff on somebody else. Just listen to their

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
stuff. Yeah.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
I got one more serious one that I want to read

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
just because I love the question.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
There's so much

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
to like here from, I want to say from

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Cocktain, but I don't think that's right.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
It's C-K-O-T-A-N-E.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
What is the best way to

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
greet a girl when you first meet her? Is shaking hands

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
awkward? Is it appropriate to give a sideways

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
hug? Context.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Perhaps like on a first date

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
or a blind date. Recently,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
my grandmother hooked me up with a date

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
with this girl she met during a Zumba

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
class.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
What is that?

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
You know, Zumba. Zumba, Zumba.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Go on. Yeah, it's like Brazilian

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
yoga or something. What's your

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
grandmother doing there? I don't know.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
I talked to the girl on Facebook and she

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
was very much interested in meeting up with me to go on a date.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
How do I greet her in such a way

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
as to give a good lasting impression that

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
will set the tone for the rest of the day? God,

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
that's tough. Cause like you can't. Tongue her.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
What'd you say?

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Tongue her. Just tongue her?

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Did you say tongue her? Yeah, tongue her.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Like, tongue kiss her.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
That's inappropriate. Travis, there

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
are nine or ten different ways that I could take that.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I think

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
I, Sue, that, see this is tough.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Because if you, if you,

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
if you shake hands, you're setting a weird

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
tone. Yeah, don't shake hands. And definitely

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
don't side hug.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
You're damned. Here's what you can.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Alright, I'm going to list off all the things you absolutely

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
cannot do. Okay, hit me.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Don't do nothing.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Don't shake your hand. That

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
says a bad tone. Don't hug her.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Don't kiss her.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Don't. No high fives. No high

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
fives. No physical contact.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Whatsoever. So don't not touch her, but don't

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
touch her, whatever you do. Yeah.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Don't do nothing though. Chest bump. What

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
about a chest bump? That's touch. Don't

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
do that. There's some

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
sensitive stuff up on the top. What about

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
just, the first time you meet her, just

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
slow dance with her.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Ooh, that's good. Ooh, you know what you should do?

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Zumba her. Just zumba all over.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
You know, if you

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
do go in for a chest bump though, that's a pretty clear

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
message about what kind of night the girl's going to have.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
She's not. This is going to be terrible for both

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
of us. Give it. Essentially

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
if you stand across the way, just slap your chest and go,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
hey bruh, chest bump. Here it comes.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Chest bump, bruh, chest bump. I'm going to bruise those.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
You're going to have a bad night.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
I'm not paying.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
I didn't bring any money.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
I stole your wallet when I chest bumped you.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
You're paying, I guess, by extension.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Um, so don't

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
do any of those things.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Don't do anything, but don't do nothing.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Why don't we bring back kissing her hand?

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
No. God.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
No? Drop to one day, kiss her hand.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Make sure you're wearing

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
a fedora

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
and make sure you're within eye

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
range of me so I can come kick the shit out of you.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Yeah. Dullard.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
What about pinky swear?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
How do pinky swear that we're going to be in love?

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Maybe,

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
maybe this is the kind of thing

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
that you should decide with

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
her ahead of time on Facebook.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
When I see you, what is the proper...

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
How should I touch you?

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Tell me how to touch you.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
God damn it.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I want to touch you, right?

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
You know you're

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
wondering about the right moment to say I love you.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
You found it.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
This is it, right here.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
She won't think about what you're doing with your hands.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
I think you want to touch me too.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Yeah, I think you'd like to touch me.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
I think I would like to touch you.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
We don't know each other well.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
I want to make sure when I touch you...

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Listen, I can't stress this enough.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
You really have to type this whole paragraph

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
before you send it.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Because if you send this piecemeal,

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
there's a good chance you're going to lose her midstream.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
She's going to see the whole thought

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
and see it through to the end.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Because if you just open without it touching you...

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
You can't...

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Just send her an email that says

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
could you wear clothing with brightly marked

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
areas where it's okay for me to touch you.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Just a circle here.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Can you wear a hyper-colored t-shirt?

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Oh, fuck.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
You should probably just not go on the date.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
You should probably just stay home

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
and just translate.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Not in the bathtub.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
This is Griffin's last question.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
But first, a couple quick housekeeping things.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
We are sorry we missed last week.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
I know a lot of you depend on us

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
for the only good thing that happens to you.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
It's your bright spot, your sliver

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
in the otherwise gray

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
gray, gray cloud

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
of your Monday. I get it.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Monday, man. Work week's starting.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
We're sorry we weren't there for you.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
It won't happen again. It will.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
NBNBAM.com is the site

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
where you can

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
where you can talk

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
to people. You can ask us

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
questions there. You can see all the different methods.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
You can ask us questions. There are forums

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
there that are replete

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
with people who share your interest and

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
my brother, my brother and me. We are

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
reordering

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
some of our hoodies

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
because they were so popular

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
and you guys raised a lot of money

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
for Big Brothers Big Sisters. I'm not sure of an exact number yet.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
I'll share it when you get it, but you guys

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
did awesome. We actually

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
we have a confession.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
We actually gave all of that

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
money to the Bathtub Safety Coalition.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Like Big Brothers Big Sisters,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
they give out an important service,

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
but they don't stop people from

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
dying in bathtubs.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Well, I heard they were going to change

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
it to Big Brothers Big Sisters Big Bathtubs.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Yeah. Oh, God, that's

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
terrible. That's a terrible

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
that's a horrible. That's

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
very, you know, I said that out

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
loud and

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
that's a bad combination of words.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
You didn't send that one to the old thought

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
factory. Who's in the bathtub?

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Darlene and Mike. I don't want to talk about it.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
They're both big and they're related.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
That's all we need to say.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
They're siblings.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
But seriously, thank you guys as always

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
for listening. Love to get some

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
more people on board. There's some great ways of doing

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
that. One, just burn a CD,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
you know, just burn a CD and give it to

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
somebody and say, here, I think you might enjoy

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
this. Also, we love it when people

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
share

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
our quotes. Share

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
NBNBAM quotes with that hashtag

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
NBNBAM and

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
make sure you don't

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
put at NBNBAM at the beginning

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
or else only people who

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
already follow us will see it. So spread

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
it around. Spread

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
the knowledge,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
the wisdom,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
the gift, I guess. I'm

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
going to start calling the show The Gift if you guys are

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
cool with that. I'm going to

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
call it The Secret. People are already hooking us

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
up. Kimbo 2042

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
is out there spreading

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
the word. As always, Michael Maney's

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
there. Like an

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
archangel. Like an archangel.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Pat likes it hot.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Our boy Pat, you know, he's up in

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
the mix spreading the

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
word. So

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
also, I meant to tell you guys, I

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
had a dream last night

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
that NBNBAM

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
was going to do a live show

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
in my dream.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Really? It made me very excited.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
And so I

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
personally am resolving that.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
You woke up this morning and

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
you were pregnant.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
In nine months, Travis

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
is going to pass a live My Brother, My Brother

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
and Me show from his fertile womb.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Now, speaking of

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
gatherings, our buddy Rocky Horror

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
who is a DJ

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
is putting the final

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
the finishing touches, I think, as they say

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
in the mixtape world, on the My Brother, My Brother

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
and Me mixtape.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
And you're going

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
to dig it. I haven't heard

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
it except for a couple tracks, but I think you're really going to

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
enjoy it. There's a new

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
track that he's got on his feed. You can find it on his

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Twitter. It's at Rocky Horror.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
But he's been talking about doing a

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
release party

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
here in Huntington.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Ah, shit. Which would be crazy.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
But if

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
we do that, you're not going to want to miss that

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
because that's going to be loked. You think at the

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Elk Lodge? I'm going to push for the Elk

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Lodge. Or Billy Bob's?

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Yeah, I don't know. Because I know some

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
septuagenarian veterans who would really

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
dig Rocky Horror's vibes. Yeah,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
I think they would. And I think, like if we did

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
that, we would all be there. I would hope.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I would think we would all get there for that.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
But, yeah.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
There's no tease people though.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
It might not happen. It might not happen.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
It might happen. We'll

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
keep you out of the ground and we'll of course spread the word

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
on Twitter

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
and stuff and

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
the website and things like that. So, Griffin.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Yeah, sure.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Enough of this garbage. Give me the rest of the stuff.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
This very final, very

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
last question was sent in by Matty B. Thank you Matty B.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Lily. And usually I just read the headline

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
of these questions, but I feel like I should read the

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
extra stuff on here too

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
because it ramps up.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Lily asks,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
How do you get spaghetti stains

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
out of underwear? I have gotten

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
spaghetti stains in my underwear. My

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
white cotton underwear. I have spaghetti

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
stains in my white cotton underwear.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Laughing.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Laughing.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
What is Justin McElroy?

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
This has been my brother,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
my brother, me. Kiss your dad's square

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
on the lips.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Music.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
It's very important that you don't

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
try to get the stains out

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
by wearing the underwear in the bathtub

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
because that's how you get trench butt.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Laughing.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Laughing.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Luda!

54:04.000 --> 54:30.000
Laughing.
