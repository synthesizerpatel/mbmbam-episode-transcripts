00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, the show for the modern era.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.120
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.120 --> 01:03.040
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:03.040 --> 01:08.560
It's summertime, and the livin' is easy.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.560
This is cool. This is cool.

01:13.440 --> 01:14.480
This is cool.

01:14.480 --> 01:20.960
That one was pretty fucking cool, Juice. It was a cool song. I'm gonna burn that onto my CDs later.

01:20.960 --> 01:24.720
I'm gonna put that up on Kazaa for other people to listen to.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.520
That's good shit, man. So it's summertime basically,

01:27.520 --> 01:30.160
and this is the My Brother, My Brother, Me summertime preview.

01:30.160 --> 01:33.840
A lot of people can't even put a fucking t-shirt on until we tell them how to.

01:33.840 --> 01:37.120
So it's basically summertime at pools.

01:37.120 --> 01:39.920
We have been getting so many emails and tweets saying,

01:39.920 --> 01:42.320
will the livin' be easy this year?

01:42.320 --> 01:45.600
And Justin just went ahead and gave that away right off the top.

01:45.600 --> 01:53.120
The livin' will be easy. It's been about three years and change since the livin's been easy.

01:53.120 --> 01:58.320
The livin' hasn't been especially easy, but let me just say, you're allowed to sweat.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.600
You don't need our permission to have a good summertime sweat.

02:01.600 --> 02:07.680
Some of this stuff is getting way, way out of hand, but I think it is time for us to give our picks.

02:07.680 --> 02:13.440
For summer 2019, and I'm gonna start with wet chairs.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.800
What chairs? Tell me about this, Triad.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.000
Public pools, environmental pools, out, out, out, out, out.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.320
Wet chairs. You sit on them, the moistness of it comes on to you,

02:24.320 --> 02:28.720
and if you can do it somewhere where there's a breeze or a fan, even better.

02:28.720 --> 02:32.720
But the chair is gonna be, in 2019, the chair is gonna be wet, folks, so.

02:34.080 --> 02:39.680
Can I give you another big, maybe this might even be a summer surprise, of what's in and what's out.

02:39.680 --> 02:40.960
The sun's out.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.600
Oh, wow, yeah.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.160
That's fun.

02:44.160 --> 02:44.880
It's out?

02:44.880 --> 02:46.640
The sun's out, yep.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.720
And also, guns out.

02:48.720 --> 02:54.160
Oh, guns have been out, except for water guns, and even those are on thin ice.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.840
The family towel.

02:56.960 --> 02:57.840
Okay.

02:57.840 --> 03:08.480
Wait, it's 2019, you can't spend the extra energy to wash a bunch of towels for your whole family.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.280
Yep.

03:09.280 --> 03:14.000
Detergent is terrible, the water you use is terrible, the electricity you use is terrible.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.040
Family towel.

03:15.040 --> 03:15.360
One big towel.

03:15.360 --> 03:21.760
Hey, kids, everybody get underneath this massive towel, and let's get dry as a family.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.880
We're all gonna go into the arcade together.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.920
And they don't like our wet trunks in there, do they?

03:28.720 --> 03:31.600
They are, they don't like our wet family,

03:31.600 --> 03:35.600
and we're gonna show them that we can be as dry as any other family in there,

03:35.600 --> 03:37.600
with this huge shared towel.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.720
Well, take that, Billy Bob's, or whatever.

03:41.360 --> 03:46.000
It's themed to things everybody in the family likes.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.240
There's a PAW Patrol corner, and a bunch of cigars in the middle.

03:51.760 --> 03:52.720
That's for little brother.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.840
That's for my little brother who loves to smoke.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.320
I do, I love that shit, man, the big cigarettes.

04:01.040 --> 04:05.120
Now, Justin, it kind of sounds like you're describing potentially like a quilt towel.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.440
It's a family towel.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.480
It's a family towel, Travis.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.600
It's not my trend.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.280
Travis, it's just what's on trend this year.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.560
Use your fucking ears.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.120
Can I tell you-

04:13.120 --> 04:15.040
I don't have a bunch of excuses for it.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.000
This is another what's out, sand buckets.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.960
What's in, sand suitcases.

04:21.840 --> 04:25.840
So we're putting sand in suitcases in 2019, folks.

04:25.840 --> 04:26.480
That's correct.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
How fucking random is that?

04:30.560 --> 04:32.000
Well, but here's what it is, Griffin.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.160
Here's what we realized, when you put sand in buckets,

04:34.160 --> 04:35.680
what are you gonna do when it's time to go home?

04:35.680 --> 04:37.840
You're gonna take, that might spill out of the bucket,

04:37.840 --> 04:41.120
but if you put it in a suitcase, you can zip that closed,

04:41.120 --> 04:42.400
keep that sand for next time.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.520
I'll tell you what's out, popsicles are out.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.960
Get out of here, popsicles.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.160
What's in their place?

04:48.160 --> 04:50.240
Slopsicles, Justin.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.760
What's a slopsicle?

04:51.760 --> 04:56.160
Well, you know how they make a popsicle with some sort of fruit juice, typically?

04:57.360 --> 05:01.440
Slopsicle can get a little bit sillier than that, I guess.

05:01.440 --> 05:01.920
Like what?

05:02.720 --> 05:04.400
Well, let me bring this up.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.680
Savory popsicles.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.200
What's going on with these things?

05:07.200 --> 05:08.160
And they don't exist.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.040
Like a borscht?

05:10.240 --> 05:12.560
A borscht would be totally, totally dope.

05:12.560 --> 05:16.560
I'm sitting by the pool and I scoff at it and go sit in my wet chair

05:16.560 --> 05:19.440
and I'm beating the heat, but I could really use a treat.

05:19.440 --> 05:24.480
But not a sweet treat, a savory, savory sort of chicken stock popsicle.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.160
A slopsicle, if you will.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.720
Now we're cooking with summer gas.

05:28.720 --> 05:29.360
I like that.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.280
Hey, hey, mom and dad.

05:31.280 --> 05:35.280
The newest food trend for your family this summer, baked steak.

05:35.840 --> 05:36.340
Ooh.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.180
Bake it.

05:39.280 --> 05:40.560
So the grill and-

05:40.560 --> 05:42.240
Throw your grill in a well.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.840
Throw it in the pool because you're not going to need either of these fucking things anymore.

05:47.360 --> 05:51.040
You don't need the pool and you don't need the grill

05:51.040 --> 05:54.080
because your family's going to be so busy eating baked steak.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.160
They're never going to get wet again.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.400
You know what else is out this summer?

05:58.400 --> 05:59.520
Cannibalism.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.080
It's out.

06:00.080 --> 06:00.580
Yes.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.400
Don't stop eating the folks.

06:02.400 --> 06:02.960
Stop it.

06:02.960 --> 06:07.680
We had a lot of fun with that in 2018, but it's over now.

06:07.680 --> 06:08.720
It's done.

06:08.720 --> 06:12.800
And listen, we know all the celebrities were into cannibalism in 2018,

06:12.800 --> 06:14.240
but they're off it now.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.240
And we shouldn't have endorsed it on our show last year.

06:18.240 --> 06:18.560
I feel terrible.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.000
Because it's murder, folks.

06:20.000 --> 06:20.960
It is murder.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.480
It was always murder.

06:22.480 --> 06:27.040
Even if you're doing free range farm to table cannibalism, it's still bad.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.000
Still pretty bad.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.200
So let me go ahead and say, I hope this one doesn't turn out like cannibalism,

06:31.200 --> 06:33.120
but tank tops are out and stank tops are in.

06:34.000 --> 06:34.480
Now-

06:34.480 --> 06:38.000
And I know it seems like I'm just adding S to the just common summer things,

06:38.000 --> 06:43.760
but this is a tank top that does already have quite a scent to it.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.360
Hey, it's 2019.

06:45.360 --> 06:52.800
And this year, nobody worth their salt is using wild seagulls to give their pool a beachy feel.

06:52.800 --> 06:59.440
We all had a lot of fun in 2018 using wild seagulls that we captured in the wild

06:59.440 --> 07:05.200
and then tied to lawn chairs to give our pool a beachy feel.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.800
We're not doing that anymore.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.200
Stop doing that.

07:09.200 --> 07:09.760
Stop it.

07:10.800 --> 07:16.720
Go untie those birds and drive them back to Myrtle Beach in your car.

07:16.720 --> 07:21.280
They'll appreciate it and everyone will think you're a hero for returning those birds.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.640
You know what else is out?

07:22.640 --> 07:22.960
What?

07:23.600 --> 07:24.560
Slip and slides.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.880
Slip and slides are out?

07:26.880 --> 07:27.600
You know what's in?

07:29.200 --> 07:30.240
Grip and stands.

07:31.200 --> 07:36.160
We're going to put down some of those like things you put in your shower on your slip and slide.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.560
You're going to take a run at it, but then, oh, good.

07:39.360 --> 07:42.000
Plenty of grip there, even though the surface is wet.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.480
And you're going to stand confidently and finish your beverage.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.000
Sight gags.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.120
Let's deal with it.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.280
The hat with two beer cans out.

07:49.280 --> 07:53.280
Out, pretending to drink from an empty koozie.

07:53.280 --> 07:53.780
In.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.520
Very funny this year.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.440
Very funny.

07:57.440 --> 08:01.520
Out, shirt that says FBI, federal body inspector.

08:01.520 --> 08:05.280
In, shirt that says FBI, federal Bible inspector.

08:07.040 --> 08:07.680
That's in.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.960
A shirt that says FBI, Federal Bureau of Investigation.

08:10.960 --> 08:11.840
That's in.

08:11.840 --> 08:12.960
It's funny.

08:12.960 --> 08:13.680
Songs.

08:13.680 --> 08:14.880
Let's do it.

08:14.880 --> 08:15.840
Baby shark.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.840
Out, adult dog.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.840
In.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.080
That's the new summer anthem.

08:22.080 --> 08:22.880
Adult dog.

08:23.440 --> 08:24.640
Too many beans.

08:24.640 --> 08:25.140
In.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.880
Not enough beans.

08:26.880 --> 08:27.380
Out.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.200
LMFAO.

08:29.200 --> 08:29.680
Out.

08:29.680 --> 08:30.880
LYLAS.

08:30.880 --> 08:31.440
In.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.720
LMFAO is back.

08:33.360 --> 08:33.920
Well, shit.

08:34.960 --> 08:35.760
They're back in.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.920
No, we just let them back in.

08:37.920 --> 08:40.080
And that's how fast these trends move, folks.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.760
It's a very fast thing.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.360
The adult dog died.

08:43.360 --> 08:43.760
Out.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.120
Cucumbers.

08:46.000 --> 08:46.500
In.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.220
In.

08:47.220 --> 08:48.420
Newcumbers.

08:48.420 --> 08:49.860
Now, what are newcomers?

08:49.860 --> 08:51.780
They're cucumbers I just bought.

08:52.660 --> 08:53.380
Okay, got it.

08:53.380 --> 08:58.340
I had some cucumbers in my fridge and they went bad and they got real soft and I had to throw them away.

08:58.340 --> 09:00.500
And then I had to go buy newcomers.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.060
Yep.

09:01.060 --> 09:03.380
These are Travis's good new cucumbers.

09:03.380 --> 09:04.260
My newcomers.

09:04.980 --> 09:07.940
Those are our summer trends for 2019.

09:08.740 --> 09:09.620
I'm excited.

09:09.620 --> 09:10.500
I hope you're excited.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.500
But mainly this is an advice show.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.700
So that's what we're going to be predominantly doing.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.060
That's still on trend.

09:17.060 --> 09:28.260
As on trend as it ever has been in this time of change and evolution, some things remain the same and advice is one of those for us.

09:28.820 --> 09:30.740
Here's a question from you, our listening audience.

09:30.740 --> 09:37.300
If you've got a query that we can help with, please email mbmbam at maximumfund.org.

09:37.300 --> 09:41.060
I'm a happily married man and right now my wife and I aren't looking to have kids.

09:41.060 --> 09:45.620
Sometimes, however, my wife will watch her friends' kids for them.

09:45.620 --> 09:51.380
She is great with kids and even though I don't feel I am, the kids seem to like me too.

09:52.580 --> 09:55.620
So much so that they like drawing us pictures.

09:56.260 --> 09:59.300
Naturally put them on the fridge like a good adult should.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.860
How long do I keep these pictures on the fridge?

10:01.860 --> 10:05.700
I have no emotional attachment to them but I also don't want to hurt their feelings.

10:05.700 --> 10:09.620
Being parents yourselves, I figured you would have some insight into the matter.

10:09.620 --> 10:10.660
Help me, brothers.

10:10.660 --> 10:13.940
What's the statute of limitations on kids' drawings when you don't have kids?

10:13.940 --> 10:16.580
That's from Coloring Calamity in Colorado Springs.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.420
All right.

10:18.420 --> 10:19.860
Yeah, we can tackle this.

10:21.380 --> 10:30.180
How many, if I were to try to count, if I had one American dollar for every piece of paper

10:30.180 --> 10:34.660
printed out that had a drawing of a bug, let's say a caterpillar or a ladybug on it,

10:34.660 --> 10:42.820
that my little guy had splotched some not even correct color paint nowhere even close to this

10:42.820 --> 10:43.700
fucking bug.

10:43.700 --> 10:49.700
Not even touching, not even accidentally getting within the lines even a little bit.

10:50.500 --> 10:56.420
I could retire from all work and buy the United States and run it like some sort of mad emperor.

10:57.300 --> 11:02.900
So like, if I hung all of these on the fridge, the fridge would fall over with the last one

11:02.900 --> 11:04.020
I hang and kill me.

11:04.020 --> 11:06.500
So like, I can't do all of them.

11:06.500 --> 11:13.460
It's, see, Charlie just finished her first year of preschool, and so she brought home

11:14.420 --> 11:21.380
treasures almost every day, and my wife and I have had this ongoing debate that I feel

11:21.380 --> 11:28.020
like I can tell when she put a lot of heart into a piece and when she was just kind of

11:28.020 --> 11:32.820
watching the clock, letting it tick down to 130 and she's gonna dip out and be like,

11:32.820 --> 11:35.380
oh, I guess I can't finish them all, I don't care.

11:35.380 --> 11:40.500
Anyway, bye, suckers, bye, have a nice nap, idiots, I'm going home.

11:40.500 --> 11:46.100
You gotta appreciate it to the face, but then the refrigerator, that's daddy's box, that's

11:46.100 --> 11:48.420
where daddy keeps his favorite stuff.

11:48.420 --> 11:54.820
And if it's gonna go up on daddy's favorite box, like, you know, I wanna know that the

11:54.820 --> 11:56.580
artist had intent.

11:56.580 --> 12:00.820
I wanna know that my son didn't just sort of splurge some shit down while he was sort

12:00.820 --> 12:07.220
of absentmindedly just thinking about Pikachu, as he is wont to do, constantly, because he's

12:07.220 --> 12:08.980
my wonderful boy.

12:08.980 --> 12:13.220
Here's the thing, question asking, the next time that kid comes to your house, he's not

12:13.220 --> 12:18.100
gonna be like, hey, Mr. Derek, where the fuck is my picture?

12:18.100 --> 12:20.820
Like, unless he is.

12:20.820 --> 12:23.060
Unless he's the kind of kid who would do that.

12:23.060 --> 12:26.740
Unless he's a real fucking minkus that's gonna put you on blast.

12:26.740 --> 12:29.380
I would say, but if he comes back and he's like, where is it?

12:29.380 --> 12:33.860
Just say, I submitted it to the local gallery for consideration.

12:33.860 --> 12:34.900
That's good.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.100
Oh, that's good.

12:36.100 --> 12:39.460
No, well, it's not good, but it's something.

12:39.460 --> 12:40.620
It's something you can try.

12:40.620 --> 12:43.700
It's lying to a child, yeah, I mean, that's what it is.

12:43.700 --> 12:44.700
Unless you did.

12:44.700 --> 12:50.660
I've kind of gotten pretty good at just throwing stuff away secretly.

12:50.660 --> 12:54.900
You know that one scene from Now You See Me where they're like passing the card all around?

12:54.900 --> 12:57.060
That shit is so cool.

12:57.060 --> 12:58.060
Oh my god.

12:58.060 --> 12:59.060
It's so fucking cool.

12:59.060 --> 13:05.300
That's me with like bad pictures of rainbows, just like slipping it, like no one's looking.

13:05.300 --> 13:06.300
It's behind you.

13:06.300 --> 13:07.300
What's that over there?

13:07.300 --> 13:08.300
Tres.

13:08.300 --> 13:15.360
I have also gotten good at that with eating food off of my daughter's plate that she's

13:15.360 --> 13:18.860
not going to eat, but also refuses to let me eat.

13:18.860 --> 13:24.340
Oh my god, yeah, I am like the Harlem Globetrotters, just like taking a little chunk of meatloaf

13:24.340 --> 13:28.940
off Henry's plate and like twirling it around his head so he gets dizzy and he's like, wait,

13:28.940 --> 13:29.940
where's it?

13:29.940 --> 13:30.940
It's gone.

13:30.940 --> 13:31.940
Okay, who cares?

13:31.940 --> 13:32.940
And I'm like, yeah, I care.

13:32.940 --> 13:37.060
I care about the delicious Trader Joe's meatloaf flavor I have now.

13:37.060 --> 13:39.340
Notorious food thieves, the Harlem Globetrotters.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.340
Yes.

13:40.340 --> 13:43.220
Do you guys want a yahoo?

13:43.220 --> 13:48.060
Did we, I mean, I don't think, here's what I've ended up doing, okay?

13:48.060 --> 13:54.220
Get a big Tupperware thing, just a gigantic, just the biggest one you can find, and then

13:54.220 --> 13:56.860
just keep throwing things into it.

13:56.860 --> 14:02.220
I'm making, it's a debt that I'm building against my future self, but it's not current

14:02.220 --> 14:03.220
my problem.

14:03.220 --> 14:04.220
But it's not.

14:04.220 --> 14:05.220
It's my future problem.

14:05.220 --> 14:10.500
It's not because one time, like four or five years ago, our papa brought me a cardboard

14:10.500 --> 14:16.100
box full of my like first grade bullshit, and he said, I thought you would want this.

14:16.100 --> 14:22.020
Okay, but he brought you a box of 3% of your first grade bullshit.

14:22.020 --> 14:24.760
I don't know, the box was full.

14:24.760 --> 14:28.060
What if you peeked then, though, there's no way to know.

14:28.060 --> 14:31.740
You'd think if I had gone through that and been like, oh God, this is good, this is so

14:31.740 --> 14:33.820
much better than this shit I'm creating now.

14:33.820 --> 14:36.220
I like Travis's old shit.

14:36.220 --> 14:39.620
I like Turkey Hand.

14:39.620 --> 14:40.940
It was a good Turkey Hand.

14:40.940 --> 14:44.500
Man, ever since Turkey Hand, it's all been so fucking downhill.

14:44.500 --> 14:49.260
A lot of stuff was derivative of Turkey Hand, and these days, it's just like, at our live

14:49.260 --> 14:52.380
shows, Travis busts out Turkey Hand, and it's like, oh God, man.

14:52.380 --> 15:00.620
Remember when Travis said, knock, knock, dad said, who's there, and Travis said, knife,

15:00.620 --> 15:07.220
and dad said, knife who, and Travis said, would you rather work nightly or knifely?

15:07.220 --> 15:10.700
A real joke that three-year-old Travis told.

15:10.700 --> 15:14.380
And you've never done anything that good on this show, Travis.

15:14.380 --> 15:20.260
It's a really excellent, it subverts, it's an excellent joke that I'm still laughing

15:20.260 --> 15:21.260
about to this day.

15:21.260 --> 15:22.620
I memorized it verbatim.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.040
It's an excellent joke.

15:24.040 --> 15:27.680
And do you remember when that car was gonna hit me, and you lifted it up from the back

15:27.680 --> 15:30.700
of the wheels of it, like Hancock, when you were five?

15:30.700 --> 15:35.220
Yeah, I try not to do that anymore, though, just because of my back, you know?

15:35.220 --> 15:36.220
But I was three, my guess.

15:36.220 --> 15:39.520
And that's it, you peaked, you were so, and do you remember how fucking cut and handsome

15:39.520 --> 15:40.520
you were at five?

15:40.520 --> 15:41.520
Yeah.

15:41.520 --> 15:45.020
And now you are just a shambling mess of bones and skin?

15:45.020 --> 15:46.020
I know.

15:46.020 --> 15:47.020
Remember?

15:47.020 --> 15:48.020
Yes.

15:48.020 --> 15:52.620
You remember the treatment for Hancock, and you sold it, and it sat on the blacklist for

15:52.620 --> 15:56.660
20 years, but you made a ton of fucking cash?

15:56.660 --> 16:00.820
I remember that, and I also remember, and I don't know why they didn't credit it as

16:00.820 --> 16:06.460
based off a true story, like it originally said on the manuscript when I wrote it, of

16:06.460 --> 16:07.700
like, this is my life.

16:07.700 --> 16:14.260
I got my oil changed, and the place that I get my oil changed at, I started to sit down

16:14.260 --> 16:19.300
in like the hangout area, where you wait for your car to be healthy and ready for you again,

16:19.300 --> 16:23.680
and they did have a TV that was showing Hancock, and it mystified me that that was the choice

16:23.680 --> 16:28.000
that they had made for film to watch in 2019 in their waiting room.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.100
So I called a Lyft, and I came home, where there was no Hancock.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.660
Do you want a Yahoo?

16:34.660 --> 16:35.660
Yes.

16:35.660 --> 16:41.660
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Emma Cant, thank you Emma, it's Yahoo Answers user Cuddlepunch,

16:41.660 --> 16:50.140
who asks, what would a heaven for elephants be like?

16:50.140 --> 16:53.540
What would a heaven for elephants be like?

16:53.540 --> 16:55.060
Let's get this out of the way.

16:55.060 --> 16:56.060
Peanuts.

16:56.060 --> 16:57.060
Not funny.

16:57.060 --> 16:58.060
Next answer.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.060
Not funny.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.060
Not funny.

17:00.060 --> 17:05.700
I think that what if in Elephant Heaven, everything was scaled to their size?

17:05.700 --> 17:09.580
Because like right now, if an elephant tried to go into an office building, it would just

17:09.580 --> 17:10.900
be a fiasco, right?

17:10.900 --> 17:14.180
The hallways would be too narrow, the doors are too small.

17:14.180 --> 17:15.660
It'd be a mess, yeah.

17:15.660 --> 17:21.460
But this is like a world in which the elephant can get in an elevator, you know what I mean?

17:21.460 --> 17:22.460
An elevator.

17:22.460 --> 17:24.980
No, no one makes that joke, because it's fucking heaven, Griffin, for elephants.

17:24.980 --> 17:28.260
There's probably some elephants that would find that pretty funny.

17:28.260 --> 17:29.340
They go to hell.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.340
Here's all I'm saying.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.900
An elephant never forgets.

17:32.900 --> 17:33.900
Okay.

17:33.900 --> 17:38.380
And elephant will be in heaven for eternity.

17:38.380 --> 17:48.860
So an elephant in heaven is simultaneously living the entirety of existence as it understands

17:48.860 --> 17:50.860
it at all times.

17:50.860 --> 17:54.780
Not only is there an eternity ahead of it, there's an eternity of moments that are in

17:54.780 --> 17:58.680
its past that are inescapable, right?

17:58.680 --> 17:59.860
Think about that for a second.

17:59.860 --> 18:01.840
It never forgets.

18:01.840 --> 18:05.220
So probably they would need some way to rectify that, I imagine.

18:05.220 --> 18:09.540
I think elephant heaven is the ability to forget, and that's all I'm saying, is like

18:09.540 --> 18:11.420
they just want to be able to forget something.

18:11.420 --> 18:12.420
Welcome to heaven.

18:12.420 --> 18:13.420
Wait, what did you say?

18:13.420 --> 18:14.420
Oh, awesome.

18:14.420 --> 18:23.340
I'll tell you one thing that I know for certain about elephant heaven, and it's that the clouds

18:23.340 --> 18:26.580
have to be extremely thick.

18:26.580 --> 18:27.580
Thick clouds.

18:27.580 --> 18:31.340
They're very, very, very thick clouds, or else these bad boys are just going to right

18:31.340 --> 18:38.060
through them because of their considerable weight, thick, thick clouds.

18:38.060 --> 18:43.140
You know what would be cool is if as when you die when you're an elephant, which is

18:43.140 --> 18:46.900
the saddest thing I can imagine, but then you're up and elephant cheese.

18:46.900 --> 18:49.260
If you die when you're an elephant, you die in real life.

18:49.260 --> 18:51.820
Did you know that?

18:51.820 --> 18:56.460
I think you get walked into the, well, it wouldn't be pearl because I think that's a

18:56.460 --> 18:57.460
little too close to ivory.

18:57.460 --> 19:00.740
It would be made out of some badass shit that elephants like.

19:00.740 --> 19:06.620
But elephant St. Peter or St. Peanut is like, oh, we're right this way and I'll lead you

19:06.620 --> 19:12.020
into elephant heaven, and on the way in, you have to go through the border here, and the

19:12.020 --> 19:19.280
border is just Thomas Edison, and he has his nuts up on a table, and you get to step right

19:19.280 --> 19:20.280
on them.

19:20.280 --> 19:28.140
You step right on them as you go in, and everybody gets to do one, so that would be one thing

19:28.140 --> 19:29.140
you get.

19:29.140 --> 19:31.980
Is that Thomas Edison's hell or heaven?

19:31.980 --> 19:37.300
Thomas Edison, he might be, listen, we're not here to kink shame anybody, we're as

19:37.300 --> 19:43.340
accepting as the next one, but that's a pretty intense, that's a fun kink, but you can only

19:43.340 --> 19:44.700
do it once, it seems like.

19:44.700 --> 19:45.700
Well, on Earth.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.500
Yeah, that's a good point.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.500
That's a good point.

19:48.500 --> 19:54.580
His groin just reforms and he's ready for another rumba, if you know what I mean.

19:54.580 --> 19:56.940
Yeah, I don't think he would like that.

19:56.940 --> 19:59.420
I think that would probably be his hell.

19:59.420 --> 20:04.260
Do you think if you're an elephant and you're sick or getting a little old, and you suddenly

20:04.260 --> 20:08.620
realize that you've just walked to the elephant graveyard, do you think you're like, oh, damn

20:08.620 --> 20:09.620
it!

20:09.620 --> 20:10.620
And then you die?

20:10.620 --> 20:11.620
Ah, shoot.

20:11.620 --> 20:12.620
What did I do?

20:12.620 --> 20:13.620
I shouldn't have come.

20:13.620 --> 20:19.060
Think about that, if every time a human being was about to die, we just found ourselves

20:19.060 --> 20:25.060
walking towards a cemetery, and you're like, oh, well, I guess this is it, I'm going this

20:25.060 --> 20:27.260
way for some reason.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.260
Bummer.

20:28.260 --> 20:33.540
I wish I could turn around, but I guess I'm...

20:33.540 --> 20:38.460
I was walking a quiz nose, just kind of lost my train of thought.

20:38.460 --> 20:41.100
Nah, farts.

20:41.100 --> 20:45.340
But then you get to stomp on Tommy Ed's balls, and that's pretty righteous for me.

20:45.340 --> 20:48.820
Shoot, man, I'd want that to be my...

20:48.820 --> 20:52.380
I'm not a fan of the gentleman, I would like that waiting for me at the pearly gates.

20:52.380 --> 20:55.940
I think we all, I mean, we're gonna be up there for a while.

20:55.940 --> 20:57.900
We have this time for everything.

20:57.900 --> 20:58.900
So every week...

20:58.900 --> 20:59.900
We can get over there and stomp on those balls, no problem.

20:59.900 --> 21:05.160
You get a little bulletin slid under your door every week, and it lets you know a schedule

21:05.160 --> 21:10.820
of who's gonna be there for a ball step, and then also, you gotta be separated into teams,

21:10.820 --> 21:14.740
so I'm on the indigo team, Travis and Justin, you're both on the blue team, so you get to

21:14.740 --> 21:15.980
share the experience.

21:15.980 --> 21:20.940
And you guys get to go at 4 of 15, and then you do get to go stomp on Tommy Ed's balls.

21:20.940 --> 21:24.060
And is it always Thomas Edison?

21:24.060 --> 21:28.620
No, they're gonna cycle people in and out, yeah.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.980
Okay, are they all going to be inventors?

21:31.980 --> 21:34.620
Most of them are inventors, yeah.

21:34.620 --> 21:38.260
Like the guy who made guns, his nuts are dunzo.

21:38.260 --> 21:45.940
The devil, the devil gonna come up there, because boy, his works are pretty naughty,

21:45.940 --> 21:46.940
I think.

21:46.940 --> 21:51.300
He's gonna get on those nuts.

21:51.300 --> 21:58.620
Oh, crap, here's another question.

21:58.620 --> 22:02.580
I had a party at my house tonight, and everyone has left except two people.

22:02.580 --> 22:05.700
Now I'm laying on the floor, waiting for these two people to leave so I can go to bed.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.260
They said they need some time to sober up, which is understandable.

22:08.260 --> 22:12.660
We don't want people to drive drunk, but they both just opened another drink.

22:12.660 --> 22:14.580
How do I get them to leave?

22:14.580 --> 22:17.140
It's from Drowsy in Denver.

22:17.140 --> 22:18.140
That's why-

22:18.140 --> 22:19.140
You can't just go to bed, can you?

22:19.140 --> 22:20.140
Can't you just go to bed?

22:20.140 --> 22:21.140
Just go to sleep.

22:21.140 --> 22:24.380
Um, yeah, I mean, that's one rude option.

22:24.380 --> 22:30.260
I mean, Simitonic didn't do all this work for you not to play their song for people.

22:30.260 --> 22:31.260
Thank you, yes.

22:31.260 --> 22:35.220
For this exact syn- this exact syn- situation- situation-emulation.

22:35.220 --> 22:39.940
And what's great about that song is not only is it directed to the point, like, hey, it's

22:39.940 --> 22:45.740
closing time, but it is of such a quality that the more it is repeated, the harder it

22:45.740 --> 22:47.260
becomes to listen to.

22:47.260 --> 22:51.580
Like, the first time you hear it, you get this, like, nostalgic, like, oh, closing time.

22:51.580 --> 22:54.380
And then the second time, you're like, oh, it's closing time.

22:54.380 --> 22:58.260
And then by, like, the third, fourth, fifth time, you're like, I have to get out of here.

22:58.260 --> 23:04.860
Like, it is an effective tool, as well as being a direct message.

23:04.860 --> 23:09.340
I can listen to that- I could hear that track about five times before it even started to

23:09.340 --> 23:10.340
irritate me, though.

23:10.340 --> 23:11.340
No way.

23:11.340 --> 23:13.860
I think I would be into it for about 15 minutes.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.620
You're a strong man.

23:15.620 --> 23:16.620
It's a good fucking track, though.

23:16.620 --> 23:20.820
It's a great track, Simisonic's one of Simisonic's best, I'd argue.

23:20.820 --> 23:25.980
I think you need to bump into them to make the drink spill, because that works for me

23:25.980 --> 23:27.500
most of the time.

23:27.500 --> 23:31.660
And you're laying on the floor now, so that's going to be a tricky situation.

23:31.660 --> 23:36.380
You are going to have to get up and walk directly over to where they are, probably on the couch.

23:36.380 --> 23:39.060
And wow, bumping into somebody while they're sitting on a couch is going to be a pretty

23:39.060 --> 23:41.780
tough- I'm not going to lie to you.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.460
Maybe an earthquake?

23:43.460 --> 23:47.220
Can you simulate an earthquake, or say you have vertigo, and just sort of spill right

23:47.220 --> 23:50.060
into their four locos or whatever?

23:50.060 --> 23:51.580
Call them an Uber, maybe?

23:51.580 --> 23:52.580
But that's expensive.

23:52.580 --> 23:53.580
Hmm.

23:53.580 --> 23:54.580
Call them names?

23:54.580 --> 23:57.980
Nah, I don't think you want to be mean.

23:57.980 --> 24:03.900
Turn on some TV show that you're watching right now to the episode that you're watching.

24:03.900 --> 24:04.900
Uh-huh.

24:04.900 --> 24:05.900
Right?

24:05.900 --> 24:06.900
Oh, that's good.

24:06.900 --> 24:07.900
That would get me to leave any room.

24:07.900 --> 24:08.900
Oh my god, yes.

24:08.900 --> 24:13.180
I'm like, uh, what are you watching, and it's like, oh, this is season four, episode three

24:13.180 --> 24:14.180
of Damages.

24:14.180 --> 24:19.180
And I'm like, okay, goodbye, man.

24:19.180 --> 24:25.020
I don't want the first three seasons and change of Damages to be spoiled for me, so I'm going

24:25.020 --> 24:26.460
to just go ahead and go.

24:26.460 --> 24:29.180
I might have watched Damages.

24:29.180 --> 24:33.820
I would leave a room where Rufus from Bill & Ted was reading Winning Lotto Numbers if

24:33.820 --> 24:37.460
it was playing a TV show that I had not seen in the middle of the series.

24:37.460 --> 24:38.460
Hands down, nobody.

24:38.460 --> 24:39.460
I'm out.

24:39.460 --> 24:40.460
No matter what the show is.

24:40.460 --> 24:41.460
I may never watch it.

24:41.460 --> 24:42.460
No intent to watch it, doesn't matter.

24:42.460 --> 24:43.460
Yes, exactly.

24:43.460 --> 24:44.460
Might never watch it.

24:44.460 --> 24:48.380
Like me and, boys, that's why I said Damages.

24:48.380 --> 24:51.380
I'm just performances.

24:51.380 --> 24:55.860
The thing is, is I know myself well enough to know that there is no show on Earth that

24:55.860 --> 24:59.180
there is zero percent chance I might accidentally Sunday start watching.

24:59.180 --> 25:00.700
Yeah, I look at Nasty.

25:00.700 --> 25:04.440
That happened, I was on an airplane, and the person next to me was watching an episode

25:04.440 --> 25:06.860
of Lucifer, and I thought, all right.

25:06.860 --> 25:09.300
And I've since watched three seasons of Lucifer.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.500
See, that's how they get you.

25:11.500 --> 25:12.500
Yes.

25:12.500 --> 25:15.780
They seed people all over airplanes to watch it.

25:15.780 --> 25:18.580
Glenn Close is gonna get me when I'm not watching with her Damages.

25:18.580 --> 25:19.900
She'll do that to me.

25:19.900 --> 25:24.900
The thumbnail for Damages on the Amazon app, I will go there and watch my Americans show,

25:24.900 --> 25:30.180
or my Mr. Robot, and then the whole time it's gonna be like, hey, we recommend Damages.

25:30.180 --> 25:36.180
And Damages has a woman's face, only it's cracked in half, and peeking out in the chasm

25:36.180 --> 25:40.180
there is Glenn Close's face, and she's giving a shh.

25:40.180 --> 25:46.180
And so in my mind, which has never absorbed any Damages whatsoever, this is the scariest

25:46.180 --> 25:47.880
show imaginable.

25:47.880 --> 25:52.540
This is where Glenn Close nests inside of your brain, and smashes through your face.

25:52.540 --> 25:54.060
It's like some sort of H.R.

25:54.060 --> 25:55.420
Giger creation.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.740
So you have picked up some of it.

25:57.740 --> 25:59.660
I guess I've seen some Damages.

25:59.660 --> 26:01.660
I guess I have, yes.

26:01.660 --> 26:06.700
I feel like Scandal's been trying to get me for years.

26:06.700 --> 26:10.980
Scandal has been like laying, like there's boxes propped up on sticks with like treats

26:10.980 --> 26:16.020
underneath them for me, that are just labeled Scandal, and they're all over my house.

26:16.020 --> 26:18.180
Yeah, Scandal will get you too.

26:18.180 --> 26:25.020
Hey, let's take a brief pause, can we do that, to go head on over to the money zone?

26:25.020 --> 26:26.020
Sure.

26:26.020 --> 26:27.020
Sure, yes.

26:27.020 --> 26:41.500
Hey Justin, what's a website that you use frequently?

26:41.500 --> 26:46.020
A website I use frequently, um, eBay.

26:46.020 --> 26:47.020
eBay?

26:47.020 --> 26:48.020
All right.

26:48.020 --> 26:50.620
Well, why don't you start eBay too?

26:50.620 --> 26:52.540
The newer, better version of eBay.

26:52.540 --> 26:53.540
What's stopping you?

26:53.540 --> 26:55.980
Nothing, I guess, thank you.

26:55.980 --> 26:57.540
That's a really good point.

26:57.540 --> 26:58.540
Okay.

26:58.540 --> 26:59.540
Maybe use Squarespace.

26:59.540 --> 27:00.780
But wait, I did think of one thing.

27:00.780 --> 27:01.780
I thought of one thing.

27:01.780 --> 27:02.780
Okay.

27:02.780 --> 27:03.780
I don't know how to make one.

27:03.780 --> 27:04.780
Oh, okay, buddy, you should mention that.

27:04.780 --> 27:12.220
Oh, I'm seeing here in the copy, just that one of our sponsors is Squarespace.

27:12.220 --> 27:17.260
Using Squarespace, yeah, you can use it to build a website like eBay too.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.260
Or-

27:18.260 --> 27:19.260
Fuck, this is a good commercial.

27:19.260 --> 27:24.980
I couldn't hear Griffin over the sound of him signing up for Squarespace.

27:24.980 --> 27:31.220
Yeah, because he's going to use it to showcase his work on like Instagram too, or promote

27:31.220 --> 27:35.560
your physical or online business like eBay too, or announce an upcoming event or special

27:35.560 --> 27:38.960
project like Fyre Festival too.

27:38.960 --> 27:43.700
And Squarespace does this by giving you beautiful customizable templates created by world-class

27:43.700 --> 27:48.700
designers, powerful e-commerce functionality that lets you sell anything online, and everything

27:48.700 --> 27:51.060
optimized for mobile right out of the box.

27:51.060 --> 27:55.700
Analytics that help you grow in real time, and 24-7 awards-winning customer support.

27:55.700 --> 28:00.220
Make a stand out, stand out with a beautiful website from Squarespace.

28:00.220 --> 28:07.180
So head to, go to, or check out Squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

28:07.180 --> 28:11.580
And when you're ready to launch, use the offer code my brother, all one word, to save 10%

28:11.580 --> 28:15.020
off your first purchase of a website or domain.

28:15.020 --> 28:20.820
I just want to take everyone inside the show for a second.

28:20.820 --> 28:25.940
Sometimes there are certain sentences you have to say in these ads, and in the ad here,

28:25.940 --> 28:30.740
they're called a call to action, and in the Squarespace call to action, it's head to slash

28:30.740 --> 28:35.380
go to slash check out Squarespace.com slash my brother.

28:35.380 --> 28:40.460
And Travis just wanted to do them all, and let you, the listener, kind of sort through

28:40.460 --> 28:41.460
them.

28:41.460 --> 28:42.460
I couldn't pick one.

28:42.460 --> 28:43.460
It's choose your own call to action.

28:43.460 --> 28:46.860
You know, maybe you like to head to stuff, maybe you like to go to stuff, maybe you like

28:46.860 --> 28:47.860
to check out stuff.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.420
I don't want to make that decision for you.

28:49.420 --> 28:52.620
Maybe Travis didn't check out and you're like, I've never checked out anything in my life.

28:52.620 --> 28:53.620
How dare you, sir?

28:53.620 --> 28:54.620
How dare you?

28:54.620 --> 28:58.100
I'll head there, but certainly not check it out.

28:58.100 --> 29:02.260
I might go to if the circumstances are correct.

29:02.260 --> 29:06.340
I just got an email that a very special box has come in my way, and that box is going

29:06.340 --> 29:11.580
to be full of handsome clothes that are going to look slick on my bod, and that is because

29:11.580 --> 29:14.180
I am a user of Stitch Fix.

29:14.180 --> 29:18.460
And I think everybody should be, because you get really nice looking stuff, you can expand

29:18.460 --> 29:23.340
your sort of style palette if you want, and it's exciting to get these boxes, and then

29:23.340 --> 29:27.140
if you don't like what's in the box, you only like a few things, you only pay for the stuff

29:27.140 --> 29:28.140
you keep.

29:28.140 --> 29:29.260
It's really, really slick.

29:29.260 --> 29:34.420
And you also have a personal stylist that's going to help you figure out what looks good

29:34.420 --> 29:40.980
on you, and they have all kinds of good clothing brands, and it's super easy and super fun.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.180
We all have a bunch of Stitch Fix.

29:42.180 --> 29:44.580
I think I'm wearing, let me see, I'm wearing a Stitch Fix shirt right now.

29:44.580 --> 29:51.140
It's a handsome button-down dark blue oxford with some pineapple, or what are the palm

29:51.140 --> 29:52.300
trees on it?

29:52.300 --> 29:53.300
So that looks good.

29:53.300 --> 29:54.300
Summer time is fun.

29:54.300 --> 29:56.340
Wait, I'm wearing a Palm Tree Stitch Fix shirt too!

29:56.340 --> 29:57.340
Ah shit.

29:57.340 --> 29:58.340
Whoa.

29:58.340 --> 29:59.340
Uh oh.

29:59.340 --> 30:04.660
So it's good shirt, and the clothes are great, and shipping and exchanges and returns are

30:04.660 --> 30:05.660

30:05.660 --> 30:09.580

30:12.860 --> 30:15.220
One last time, Stitch Fix dot com slash my brother.

30:15.220 --> 30:17.260
Well, Alexis, we got big news.

30:17.260 --> 30:18.260
Uh oh.

30:18.260 --> 30:19.260
Season one, done.

30:19.260 --> 30:20.260
It's over.

30:20.260 --> 30:21.340
Season two, coming at you hot.

30:21.340 --> 30:22.340
Three years after.

30:22.340 --> 30:23.340
Three and a half.

30:23.340 --> 30:24.340
Three and a half.

30:24.340 --> 30:25.340
Technically almost four years.

30:25.340 --> 30:26.340
All right.

30:26.340 --> 30:29.900
And now, listen, here at Can I Pet Your Dog, the Spanish hit podcast, our seasons run for

30:29.900 --> 30:30.900
three and a half years.

30:30.900 --> 30:36.100
And then in season two, we come at you with new, hot co-hosts named you.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.100
Hi, I'm Alexis.

30:37.100 --> 30:39.700
And I also have a field trip.

30:39.700 --> 30:40.700
Dog tech?

30:40.700 --> 30:41.700
Yeah, dog news.

30:41.700 --> 30:42.700
Dog news.

30:42.700 --> 30:43.700
Yes.

30:43.700 --> 30:44.700
Oh, big shots.

30:44.700 --> 30:45.700
We'll not let them talk about their resume.

30:45.700 --> 30:46.700
Nope.

30:46.700 --> 30:47.700
Only the dogs.

30:47.700 --> 30:48.700
Yeah, only the dogs.

30:48.700 --> 30:50.900
I mean, if ever you were going to get into Can I Pet Your Dog, now's the time.

30:50.900 --> 30:56.540
Get in here every Tuesday at MaximumFun dot org.

30:56.540 --> 30:57.540
I have a Yahoo here.

30:57.540 --> 30:58.540
Can I read?

30:58.540 --> 30:59.540
Oh.

30:59.540 --> 31:00.540
What did you do?

31:00.540 --> 31:01.540
Nothing.

31:01.540 --> 31:02.540
Did you want to do a question?

31:02.540 --> 31:03.540
No.

31:03.540 --> 31:04.540
I wanted to do one of my patented bits.

31:04.540 --> 31:05.540
All right.

31:05.540 --> 31:06.540
Do it then.

31:06.540 --> 31:07.540
What's stopping you?

31:07.540 --> 31:08.540
Well, okay.

31:08.540 --> 31:10.260
Well, I just don't like to interrupt with them.

31:10.260 --> 31:12.340
I feel like that was really irritating everybody.

31:12.340 --> 31:14.140
So I just stopped trying to interrupt with them.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.140
Who is that irritating?

31:15.140 --> 31:23.860
We were the people you interrupted and I thought it was-

31:23.860 --> 31:24.860
I want to munch.

31:24.860 --> 31:25.860
Squad.

31:25.860 --> 31:26.860
Squad.

31:26.860 --> 31:27.860
Squad.

31:27.860 --> 31:28.860
I want to munch.

31:28.860 --> 31:29.860
Squad.

31:29.860 --> 31:30.860
Nailed it.

31:30.860 --> 31:31.860
Toronto!

31:31.860 --> 31:32.860
I'm so excited to-

31:32.860 --> 31:33.860
Got me.

31:33.860 --> 31:44.300
It's still on the farewell tour for Munch Squad as we continue to sunset this great

31:44.300 --> 31:45.300
bit.

31:45.300 --> 31:49.540
But before the sun goes down, sun's coming up because it's summertime, and I've got two

31:49.540 --> 31:55.700
great ice cream related news for you, the people.

31:55.700 --> 31:59.260
First up is a quick hit of Munch Squad Junior, if you will.

31:59.260 --> 32:04.180
Baskin Robbins has Stranger Things inspired flavors.

32:04.180 --> 32:05.180
Ew.

32:05.180 --> 32:06.180
For-

32:06.180 --> 32:07.180
Eggo waffle?

32:07.180 --> 32:08.180
Yeah.

32:08.180 --> 32:09.180
Like a waffle?

32:09.180 --> 32:10.180
Very good, Griffin.

32:10.180 --> 32:16.420
Eleven's Heaven is a waffle cone flavored ice cream with chocolate coated sugar cone pieces

32:16.420 --> 32:18.700
and chocolate icing flavored ribbon.

32:18.700 --> 32:24.380
So that's called Eleven's Heaven because the character on that show is fictional and loves

32:24.380 --> 32:25.380
waffles.

32:25.380 --> 32:26.380
Can I guess one?

32:26.380 --> 32:27.380
Can I guess one?

32:27.380 --> 32:28.380
Yeah.

32:28.380 --> 32:29.380
Dead teen.

32:29.380 --> 32:30.380
Dead teen.

32:30.380 --> 32:31.380
Dead teen.

32:31.380 --> 32:32.380
No.

32:32.380 --> 32:33.380
Very close.

32:33.380 --> 32:35.900
Upside down pralines.

32:35.900 --> 32:40.020
Chocolate ice cream with praline pecans and chocolate caramel flavored ribbon.

32:40.020 --> 32:42.620
I don't know why that's from the upside down.

32:42.620 --> 32:43.620
Yeah.

32:43.620 --> 32:44.620
What's that?

32:44.620 --> 32:45.620
Thematically, how does that-

32:45.620 --> 32:46.620
I don't understand.

32:46.620 --> 32:50.140
We're not done.

32:50.140 --> 32:56.460
The press release here says, because after all, even demogorgons love ice cream.

32:56.460 --> 32:57.460
No, fuck you.

32:57.460 --> 32:58.460
They don't.

32:58.460 --> 33:03.300
Here's the items that they have, because it's not just about flavors.

33:03.300 --> 33:05.300
It's about items.

33:05.300 --> 33:10.460
And some of these are just so- Okay, so there's an upside down sundae.

33:10.460 --> 33:12.060
There's a demogorgon sundae.

33:12.060 --> 33:13.860
Hey, all right.

33:13.860 --> 33:17.100
There's Briar's House Lights Polar Pizza Ice Cream Treat.

33:17.100 --> 33:18.100
Shit.

33:18.100 --> 33:19.100
Yes.

33:19.100 --> 33:20.100
What?

33:20.100 --> 33:21.100
Yes.

33:21.100 --> 33:24.420
You can't say an object that isn't ice cream in your ice cream name.

33:24.420 --> 33:27.540
Briar's House Lights Polar Pizza Ice Cream Treat.

33:27.540 --> 33:28.540
What?

33:28.540 --> 33:29.540
Is that all of it?

33:29.540 --> 33:31.020
Is it all one thing?

33:31.020 --> 33:33.620
Briar's House Lights Polar Pizza Ice Cream Treat.

33:33.620 --> 33:37.660
If it was just called Polar Pizza Ice Cream Treat, that would be a lie.

33:37.660 --> 33:46.860
You know, do you remember when- Hey, 90s kids, remember when an owner writer hung up a bunch

33:46.860 --> 33:49.940
of lights to contact the ghost of her dead son in the demon dimension?

33:49.940 --> 33:50.940
Well, good news.

33:50.940 --> 33:52.660
We done made a polar pizza about it.

33:52.660 --> 33:54.900
Come on down to Baskin Robbins.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.900
USS Butterscotch Quartz.

33:56.900 --> 33:57.900
What?

33:57.900 --> 34:01.020
Ah, you have watched every episode of this show?

34:01.020 --> 34:02.340
No fucking idea.

34:02.340 --> 34:03.340
No fucking idea.

34:03.340 --> 34:04.340
Eleven-Aid freeze.

34:04.340 --> 34:05.340
Eleven-Aid?

34:05.340 --> 34:06.340
Eleven-Aid.

34:06.340 --> 34:07.340
Because fuck it all.

34:07.340 --> 34:08.340
We're done.

34:08.340 --> 34:14.420
We're sending this show to the fucking ground.

34:14.420 --> 34:20.100
Exclusive Stranger Things merchandise, including a one of a kind Steve Funko figure.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.100
All right.

34:21.100 --> 34:26.380
Now, okay, what they mean is a Funko figure of the character Steve, but what they have

34:26.380 --> 34:32.500
done is combined two words in very close proximity to make the name Steve Funko, which sounds

34:32.500 --> 34:36.940
like the owner of the company.

34:36.940 --> 34:39.120
There's also collectible containers.

34:39.120 --> 34:43.140
We wanted to give fans a taste of the new season of Stranger Things and are thrilled

34:43.140 --> 34:46.820
to partner with Netflix to give customers across the country an experience straight

34:46.820 --> 34:49.180
out of Hawkins, Indiana.

34:49.180 --> 34:52.700
Whether you love the show that says Carol Austin, Vice President of Marketing for Baskin

34:52.700 --> 34:58.380
Robbins, whether you love the show or just love some seriously delicious ice cream creations,

34:58.380 --> 35:03.620
we've got something for everyone because those are the two kinds of people that are on Earth.

35:03.620 --> 35:06.020
And that was supposed to be the Munch Squad Jr., but it's so wild.

35:06.020 --> 35:10.020
I don't think I have time to do the other one, which is perhaps wilder.

35:10.020 --> 35:13.340
Well, I've got to hear it, but keep it tight.

35:13.340 --> 35:18.100
Dairy Queen has unveiled a lineup of box of happy subscription boxes.

35:18.100 --> 35:22.340
Box of happy.

35:22.340 --> 35:25.940
Listen to this because it's really challenging.

35:25.940 --> 35:29.560
DQ box of happy dot com.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.560
You go there.

35:30.560 --> 35:35.580
You know, you know how Dairy Queen's a place that has chicken tenders and blizzards, right?

35:35.580 --> 35:36.580
Uh huh.

35:36.580 --> 35:37.580
Okay.

35:37.580 --> 35:42.260
Well, now it's a place where in partnership with Coca-Cola, you can get a summertime subscription

35:42.260 --> 35:45.380
to three different boxes of happy.

35:45.380 --> 35:53.940
And in the box of happy, oh my God, it's three months of summer themed kits, each bringing

35:53.940 --> 36:00.540
to life a quintessential seasonal activity with a delicious twist, quote, although subscription

36:00.540 --> 36:06.060
boxes are hugely popular, today's families are seeking unique experiences instead of

36:06.060 --> 36:07.060
more stuff.

36:07.060 --> 36:13.300
So what Maria Hockenson, the executive vice president of marketing and American Dairy

36:13.300 --> 36:21.340
Queen Corporation is saying, um, is that people do love the boxes, but they hate that the

36:21.340 --> 36:24.980
boxes are full of things that would be of use to them that they would want to keep in

36:24.980 --> 36:26.160
their house.

36:26.160 --> 36:30.540
So what you're going to do is you're going to give them $45 for a subscription that will

36:30.540 --> 36:33.580
only last three months, definitely.

36:33.580 --> 36:38.260
And in the, let's just use the June camp in box as an example.

36:38.260 --> 36:43.820
It's got a built in faux non-flammable campfire.

36:43.820 --> 36:48.340
I'll decide what's, I'll decide what's flammable, exactly right.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.340
Everything's flammable.

36:49.340 --> 36:54.300
If you try hard enough, it's a non-flammable campfire designed to work with a smartphone

36:54.300 --> 36:59.340
to create a warm glow and crackling sounds of a real summer bonfire.

36:59.340 --> 37:05.380
I can't imagine any version of what you just described that isn't tremendously shitty.

37:05.380 --> 37:16.980
There's a D and there's also a DQ camp in shadow puppets, storybook and two flashlights.

37:16.980 --> 37:17.980
Ooh.

37:17.980 --> 37:22.980
To create handmade critters and imagine stories.

37:22.980 --> 37:26.980
A do-it-yourself shadow puppet box.

37:26.980 --> 37:29.980
Thank you DQ.

37:29.980 --> 37:36.220
There's a $10 DQ gift card to try the June blizzard of the month.

37:36.220 --> 37:42.780
Now the arc of this month's parent of the year award goes to this guy that said, hey

37:42.780 --> 37:43.780
kids, good news.

37:43.780 --> 37:47.780
Today we're going to sit around a fake campfire that's powered by daddy's phone and we're

37:47.780 --> 37:52.220
going to do a shadow puppet that we bought from Dairy Queen and then when you get part

37:52.220 --> 37:55.380
of that, you'd say you hate me and you want to go back to your mom's house.

37:55.380 --> 37:59.180
I do have a $10 Dairy Queen gift certificate to you.

37:59.180 --> 38:00.180
We will just bail.

38:00.180 --> 38:05.820
When daddy shines a flashlight on this page, it makes a shadow of, let's see here, Dillybar

38:05.820 --> 38:07.140
Doug on the wall.

38:07.140 --> 38:12.580
I don't know if fucking Dillybar Doug is dad.

38:12.580 --> 38:14.060
This book sucks and you suck.

38:14.060 --> 38:16.180
I don't know if Dillybar is Ron.

38:16.180 --> 38:17.180
It's dad.

38:17.180 --> 38:18.180
No, it's Doug, please.

38:18.180 --> 38:22.580
And so look at that.

38:22.580 --> 38:24.660
It's the shadow of blizzard Bill.

38:24.660 --> 38:28.260
I'm walking to mom's house.

38:28.260 --> 38:32.660
Mom's new friend Kyle makes his own shadow puppets and he doesn't have to buy them from

38:32.660 --> 38:33.660
an ice cream store.

38:33.660 --> 38:37.980
He can do a fucking monarch butterfly with one hand.

38:37.980 --> 38:48.420
Dad, the July box is a waterproof box that opens to reveal a built-in twisting sprinkler.

38:48.420 --> 38:50.100
In the box?

38:50.100 --> 38:52.060
In the box.

38:52.060 --> 38:53.780
Don't care for that.

38:53.780 --> 38:58.100
Oh man, I just can't believe, I can't believe.

38:58.100 --> 39:01.420
It includes a splashdown activity book.

39:01.420 --> 39:07.780
How many other ways are there to moisten children in a play setting?

39:07.780 --> 39:08.780
It's out of control.

39:08.780 --> 39:14.140
Out of control, but anyway, you can get that.

39:14.140 --> 39:17.960
Dairy Queen is not part of the equation in the obtaining of this.

39:17.960 --> 39:22.780
It is literally just you go to DQ box to have, but you subscribe and I guess you have to

39:22.780 --> 39:28.060
come in to redeem your gift certificate.

39:28.060 --> 39:30.260
Unhappy tastes good.

39:30.260 --> 39:31.260
Happy do taste good.

39:31.260 --> 39:32.260
You taste good though.

39:32.260 --> 39:34.580
I have a Yahoo here a bunch of people sent in.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.580
Thank you everybody.

39:35.580 --> 39:41.380
It's Yahoo Answers user Walton who asks, how do I get a better grip on popcorn?

39:41.380 --> 39:45.940
I have an issue where I drop popcorn all over myself and it's especially embarrassing in

39:45.940 --> 39:47.580
movie theaters.

39:47.580 --> 39:52.180
When I first met my wife, I would always avoid eating popcorn around her and say I'm not hungry,

39:52.180 --> 39:53.180
even if I was.

39:53.180 --> 39:55.820
Oh, that's so sad.

39:55.820 --> 39:56.820
It's pretty sad.

39:56.820 --> 40:02.460
For anyone who is scratching hunger itches with popcorn though, I feel like that's why

40:02.460 --> 40:10.980
the concession stands sort of huskier options like a hot dog are available, but that's obviously

40:10.980 --> 40:13.060
not the main crux of the question.

40:13.060 --> 40:16.300
It's that popcorn is very, very hard to eat.

40:16.300 --> 40:21.620
I mean the irony is like if you eat one piece of popcorn at a time, it's no problem, but

40:21.620 --> 40:27.020
it is also the most unfulfilling eating experience on earth.

40:27.020 --> 40:31.260
I need at least six to seven kernels at a time.

40:31.260 --> 40:38.580
I need to ruin this bag, but I keep dropping them and they do fall on my pants and penis

40:38.580 --> 40:46.660
where then the butter makes things that makes people think that I've done it down there.

40:46.660 --> 40:49.620
Just put your face in the hole.

40:49.620 --> 40:50.620
Of the popcorn?

40:50.620 --> 40:51.620
Yeah.

40:51.620 --> 40:55.300
Just put your face in the hole.

40:55.300 --> 40:57.700
Put your face in the hole.

40:57.700 --> 40:59.300
Just put your face in the hole.

40:59.300 --> 41:02.380
So wait, put your face in the hole?

41:02.380 --> 41:03.380
That's what I'm saying.

41:03.380 --> 41:05.420
Just put your face in the popcorn hole.

41:05.420 --> 41:06.420
Oh.

41:06.420 --> 41:10.700
And if people look at you funny, just look at them and be like I'm trying to avoid making

41:10.700 --> 41:11.700
a mess.

41:11.700 --> 41:14.220
I'm trying to be hygienic here over here.

41:14.220 --> 41:18.660
But then while you're talking the popcorn falls out of your mouth, lands still on the

41:18.660 --> 41:21.340
pants penis, and then it's horrible.

41:21.340 --> 41:22.340
Horrible embarrassment.

41:22.340 --> 41:26.420
What if you get a piece tucked up in your glasses that way, Juice?

41:26.420 --> 41:28.620
Oh, I don't wear glasses.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.500
I have perfect beautiful vision.

41:30.500 --> 41:31.500
What about in your nose?

41:31.500 --> 41:32.500
You got a nose, don't you?

41:32.500 --> 41:37.420
You're saying if I get popcorn stuck in my nose, what respite will I have?

41:37.420 --> 41:38.420
Yes.

41:38.420 --> 41:39.420
Is that what you're saying to me?

41:39.420 --> 41:41.220
Is that what you're asking me, a 38-year-old man?

41:41.220 --> 41:42.220
Yes, Justin.

41:42.220 --> 41:44.580
Let me ask you this about your fucking great plan, Justin.

41:44.580 --> 41:48.060
Do I need to take my glasses off to do this?

41:48.060 --> 41:51.380
Because follow-up question, how do I see a dog's purpose on the screen?

41:51.380 --> 41:55.420
Put your face in the bucket, dear Liza.

41:55.420 --> 41:56.760
Glory to God.

41:56.760 --> 41:58.100
You just put your face in the bucket.

41:58.100 --> 41:59.100
Do I take my glasses?

41:59.100 --> 42:00.740
Now, if you're wearing glasses- Yes, answer the fucking-

42:00.740 --> 42:05.100
If you're wearing glasses, I would say go eat some carrots and grow up.

42:05.100 --> 42:06.100
Wow.

42:06.100 --> 42:10.100
Now how do I eat the carrots without embarrassing myself, Justin?

42:10.100 --> 42:11.780
Put your face in the bucket of carrots.

42:11.780 --> 42:14.580
And what if I get a carrot stuck in my glasses?

42:14.580 --> 42:16.700
Now that doesn't make any sense, Travis.

42:16.700 --> 42:17.700
You're trying to do a joke.

42:17.700 --> 42:19.460
I have very tight glasses.

42:19.460 --> 42:21.100
I have very tight glasses.

42:21.100 --> 42:23.180
That's what I tell everybody.

42:23.180 --> 42:25.780
When they ask me the number one thing about you, I say tight glasses.

42:25.780 --> 42:30.140
Tight glasses that have good carrot grip.

42:30.140 --> 42:32.780
They touch- Tight glasses, wet chair.

42:32.780 --> 42:33.780
Yes.

42:33.780 --> 42:34.780
Totally in.

42:34.780 --> 42:38.180
They touch his eyeball meat, and he likes it like that.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.260
Yes.

42:39.260 --> 42:40.800
Not contacts.

42:40.800 --> 42:42.100
Don't confuse it for contacts.

42:42.100 --> 42:44.980
It is just very close to the eyeball.

42:44.980 --> 42:47.340
Keeps the eyeball in glasses.

42:47.340 --> 42:48.980
Can I invent something?

42:48.980 --> 42:49.980
Sure.

42:49.980 --> 42:51.820
Can I invent something right here, right now?

42:51.820 --> 42:54.300
Do you need us to stand back?

42:54.300 --> 42:55.300
Yeah.

42:55.300 --> 42:56.820
Give me some room to breathe here.

42:56.820 --> 42:57.820
Okay.

42:57.820 --> 42:58.820
Because you're cramping me a little bit.

42:58.820 --> 43:00.500
Sorry, like tight glasses?

43:00.500 --> 43:06.180
What about a big popcorn spoon that you can bring into theaters with you, and it would

43:06.180 --> 43:11.700
be ladle-like so that when you lift it from the popcorn bucket, you know what's going

43:11.700 --> 43:12.700
on in there.

43:12.700 --> 43:14.200
You can scout it out.

43:14.200 --> 43:19.140
You can figure out the angles, and get the perfect amount of corn with each scoop, and

43:19.140 --> 43:23.740
then you bring it up to your mouth, and tuck into it there.

43:23.740 --> 43:30.940
This is like a halfway point between Justin's monstrous wild bee steal suggestion, and a

43:30.940 --> 43:32.420
good suggestion.

43:32.420 --> 43:36.380
I think Travis will agree with me, and that's garbage, right Travis?

43:36.380 --> 43:37.380
It's close.

43:37.380 --> 43:39.620
Now what do you think about this?

43:39.620 --> 43:41.100
A popcorn shovel.

43:41.100 --> 43:46.660
Okay, and it's kind of vaguely spoon-shaped, and you use the popcorn shovel to just pile

43:46.660 --> 43:48.220
the popcorn into your mouth.

43:48.220 --> 43:49.580
What do you think about that, Travis?

43:49.580 --> 43:57.380
Now if I may, Justin, that is garbage alone, but if you include a popcorn funnel to go

43:57.380 --> 43:59.980
with the popcorn shovel.

43:59.980 --> 44:04.660
Now you're turning this into a fucking double-dare challenge, and you're wild about it.

44:04.660 --> 44:09.900
So like, and maybe, maybe the popcorn, okay, here's what you need, hey folks, buckle in,

44:09.900 --> 44:12.560
this has just become a two-person operation.

44:12.560 --> 44:17.020
You have, just let me finish, Griffin.

44:17.020 --> 44:23.020
You have the popcorn funnel on an apparatus that is positioned above your head.

44:23.020 --> 44:28.200
You have a plant, you have a compatriot of some kind sitting in the row behind you, they're

44:28.200 --> 44:29.560
slightly raised.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.680
They have the popcorn shovel.

44:31.680 --> 44:38.100
They will shovel into the funnel for you, while you look up, and then it funnels into

44:38.100 --> 44:40.100
your face from there.

44:40.100 --> 44:43.740
This sucks, I had such a good thing, and you guys are trampling all over it.

44:43.740 --> 44:46.660
Okay Griffin, what about smaller popcorn?

44:46.660 --> 44:55.700
I think you call them shred-ums.

44:55.700 --> 44:58.340
Yeah, just tiny, tiny popcorn.

44:58.340 --> 45:01.500
Oh damn, shred-ums would eat the butter up so much better.

45:01.500 --> 45:02.500
Yes.

45:02.500 --> 45:05.220
Holy shit, shred-ums would be tight, Trav.

45:05.220 --> 45:06.420
Yes.

45:06.420 --> 45:10.700
Are we talking about big popcorn that we have put in a food processor for approximately

45:10.700 --> 45:11.700
0.2 seconds?

45:11.700 --> 45:12.700
No.

45:12.700 --> 45:16.300
Or the corn kernels themselves were smaller when they got baby popcorn.

45:16.300 --> 45:17.300
Yes, yes.

45:17.300 --> 45:21.380
We take baby corn, we throw this motherfucker in the microwave.

45:21.380 --> 45:22.740
Now we're killing it, yes.

45:22.740 --> 45:26.700
This is like, if you looked at it up close, you'd be like, oh, that's normal popcorn,

45:26.700 --> 45:30.820
and then you're like, zoom out, idiot, and then you zoom out and you're like, whoa, shit,

45:30.820 --> 45:34.020
that's very tiny compared to that quarter you've put next to it.

45:34.020 --> 45:38.980
Those are kernels of popcorn sitting on the surface sands of a desert, and then you pan

45:38.980 --> 45:42.580
out and you realize, that's my hand, and that's how little these guys are.

45:42.580 --> 45:43.580
Yes.

45:43.580 --> 45:47.660
Ooh, little popcorn would be good, I would still like my spoon to be in there somewhere,

45:47.660 --> 45:49.780
but little popcorn is really good, guys.

45:49.780 --> 45:53.480
And what's good about little popcorn, what's good about it?

45:53.480 --> 45:57.480
You can do my second invention with it, which is the popcorn tube.

45:57.480 --> 46:03.980
And with this, it turns it into a game because you can kind of siphon baby corn off of your

46:03.980 --> 46:08.180
neighbor or the people sitting in front of you, like a powerful elephant trunk, and then

46:08.180 --> 46:11.260
we can make a game out of it, and you get a certain number of points by how much micro

46:11.260 --> 46:12.260
corn you snooched.

46:12.260 --> 46:14.620
Oh, okay, are you ready for this?

46:14.620 --> 46:19.060
Now, we've put out micro corn, tiny corn's been out for a long time now, right, maybe

46:19.060 --> 46:23.180
like 20 years, but now we're starting to get complaints of like, I have to eat so much

46:23.180 --> 46:25.240
of it before I feel full, right?

46:25.240 --> 46:32.100
Now we introduce giant corn, and one popped kernel is gonna sit, like that's a handful.

46:32.100 --> 46:33.340
It's a helmet.

46:33.340 --> 46:37.620
It's a helmet that you wear, and the person sitting behind, they'll know the person sitting

46:37.620 --> 46:40.140
behind you gets to enjoy it.

46:40.140 --> 46:41.140
So...

46:41.140 --> 46:45.180
And then after 20 years of that, people are like, well, yes, this is a lot, and then you're

46:45.180 --> 46:50.500
like, here's a regular popcorn, and then you reintroduce popcorn classic.

46:50.500 --> 46:52.140
I'm a genius.

46:52.140 --> 46:53.140
Would you do theming?

46:53.140 --> 46:54.140
Of what?

46:54.140 --> 46:55.140
Like how?

46:55.140 --> 46:56.140
Like what?

46:56.140 --> 46:59.060
Like, remember this popcorn shovel that people used to use?

46:59.060 --> 47:01.940
Yeah, back when it was just regular plain old boring popcorn?

47:01.940 --> 47:04.660
Before our popcorn hats that we ate off our neighbors?

47:04.660 --> 47:09.180
It had a Secret Lives of Pets 2 logo on it.

47:09.180 --> 47:10.180
Each kernel?

47:10.180 --> 47:11.180
Oh, okay.

47:11.180 --> 47:12.180
That's badass, man.

47:12.180 --> 47:16.700
Now I'm on, okay, I'm back on board now.

47:16.700 --> 47:21.380
Well, I just think that would be a fun thing for me and my kids.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.260
So like branded shovels.

47:23.260 --> 47:24.260
Yeah.

47:24.260 --> 47:32.220
And here's one thing I've got is special Secret Lives of Pets 2 earplugs that you can

47:32.220 --> 47:38.660
wear so you are not distracted by the sound of the person sitting behind you eating your

47:38.660 --> 47:40.940
hair hat, basically.

47:40.940 --> 47:43.700
Now you won't be able to hear the film that way.

47:43.700 --> 47:46.840
No, it plays through the headphones, plays through the headphones.

47:46.840 --> 47:50.300
And maybe you're just watching it on your own private screen, like you have just a smaller

47:50.300 --> 47:55.700
screen in your hand so that way you can ignore all the popcorn eating going on around you.

47:55.700 --> 47:58.340
I have a question for you guys.

47:58.340 --> 47:59.340
Okay.

47:59.340 --> 48:09.020
If I'm DQ Box of Happy order number one, two, two, three, does that mean that only 1,222

48:09.020 --> 48:11.900
other people have done this insane thing?

48:11.900 --> 48:12.900
Can that be right?

48:12.900 --> 48:15.220
That's so many people.

48:15.220 --> 48:16.220
It's so many.

48:16.220 --> 48:17.220
I think it's few.

48:17.220 --> 48:18.220
How do people even find out about it?

48:18.220 --> 48:20.980
I kind of expected more or less.

48:20.980 --> 48:21.980
I don't know.

48:21.980 --> 48:24.020
It definitely wasn't that number.

48:24.020 --> 48:26.820
That number is definitely not what I had in mind.

48:26.820 --> 48:34.180
Yeah, you expected, it's 2019, so you expected either 500,000 or three.

48:34.180 --> 48:35.180
One of the two.

48:35.180 --> 48:36.180
Yeah.

48:36.180 --> 48:37.180
I hear you.

48:37.180 --> 48:39.620
What about just corn on the cob?

48:39.620 --> 48:40.780
Popcorn on the cob is great.

48:40.780 --> 48:42.900
No, not popped.

48:42.900 --> 48:48.060
Oh, just raw corn on the cob.

48:48.060 --> 48:50.700
Do it yourself, popcorn.

48:50.700 --> 48:53.580
Uncooked, unshucked.

48:53.580 --> 48:56.900
I have a secret air fryer.

48:56.900 --> 49:01.800
I live in an apartment with two other girls, and the house shares most things, TV dishes,

49:01.800 --> 49:07.620
game consoles, et cetera, but recently I bought an air fryer, and I don't want to share it.

49:07.620 --> 49:13.860
I've used it once, home alone, and it smells very strongly of food, so much so that using

49:13.860 --> 49:16.500
it in my room might be a hit that I have it.

49:16.500 --> 49:23.540
Should I just suck it up and share?

49:23.540 --> 49:26.020
How do I better hide that I have this in my room?

49:26.020 --> 49:31.380
Have you all noticed that once a week, it smells like chicken in the house?

49:31.380 --> 49:37.540
Have you ever noticed Vicky smells like chicken in her room, and you open the door, and you

49:37.540 --> 49:43.620
see a flash of blanket, and then there's just this rectangular smoking object in the middle

49:43.620 --> 49:44.620
of her floor.

49:44.620 --> 49:50.540
Her apartment burns down every time, isn't that weird?

49:50.540 --> 49:54.220
You can't hide an air fryer.

49:54.220 --> 49:58.060
It's an electrified stink maker is what you bought.

49:58.060 --> 50:01.220
That's a really terrible humidifier.

50:01.220 --> 50:04.200
It's a bad broken humidifier that I bought.

50:04.200 --> 50:08.760
Why can't you share your fabulous fried goods with everybody else?

50:08.760 --> 50:11.580
Did you get burned in some other appliance?

50:11.580 --> 50:12.740
You share game consoles.

50:12.740 --> 50:17.260
Did they delete your Witcher save, and now you're all upset about it, because I can

50:17.260 --> 50:20.740
pretty much promise you that they're not going to delete your air fryer save.

50:20.740 --> 50:23.940
I don't think you're going to lose your progress on air fryer.

50:23.940 --> 50:28.360
Maybe one of their roommates is like a real food experimenter, like, I tried to make s'mores

50:28.360 --> 50:31.420
in the toaster, and it's like, yeah, but you ruined the toaster.

50:31.420 --> 50:36.740
Maybe they're worried, you tried to air fry an ice cream sandwich, you destroyed it.

50:36.740 --> 50:37.940
What were you fucking thinking?

50:37.940 --> 50:40.100
You ruined my air fryer.

50:40.100 --> 50:41.340
It's just seasoning it.

50:41.340 --> 50:43.300
You're just seasoning it.

50:43.300 --> 50:47.620
Everything is a little bit of the story of this air fryer, and it all adds to the flavor.

50:47.620 --> 50:49.500
That's an air fryer's purpose.

50:49.500 --> 50:52.860
That's the new movie that I've been writing about the life of an air fryer when it was

50:52.860 --> 51:00.140
adopted by a young boy, and then it ends up being used by 16 generations of the same family.

51:00.140 --> 51:03.340
I haven't seen a dog's purpose, but I assume that that's what it's about.

51:03.340 --> 51:04.340
I would never have guessed.

51:04.340 --> 51:06.100
Yeah, you have to imagine.

51:06.100 --> 51:11.060
When one robot dog works its way to becoming human by replacing one part at a time.

51:11.060 --> 51:15.180
Yeah, until it finally receives a boner from the good doctor.

51:15.180 --> 51:20.980
Dr. Light is Mega Man X6.

51:20.980 --> 51:21.980
The boner one.

51:21.980 --> 51:26.620
The boner, but people, shorthand online communities will call it the boner one.

51:26.620 --> 51:35.300
I do kind of love the idea, I will say this, I love the idea that, you know, kitchen counter

51:35.300 --> 51:37.180
space is always so limited.

51:37.180 --> 51:42.860
I love that one of my roommates would take it upon themselves to save that counter space

51:42.860 --> 51:45.980
and just keep it in their room.

51:45.980 --> 51:47.660
I do like that part of it.

51:47.660 --> 51:48.660
That's kind of you.

51:48.660 --> 51:49.660
Yeah.

51:49.660 --> 51:53.420
I will say, if I had a roommate who said, you can use it, but you have to come ask me

51:53.420 --> 51:57.380
every time, spoiler, I'd never use it.

51:57.380 --> 51:58.380
Fair, yes.

51:58.380 --> 52:05.420
Let me pitch this, it's another of my great inventions, and this will be like my own seasoning,

52:05.420 --> 52:11.580
sort of like Old Bay, just like a new sort of blend, and when you put it on food, it

52:11.580 --> 52:17.460
makes it taste just like rancid shit, and then you can cook, you say, hey, I got this

52:17.460 --> 52:23.340
new air fryer, you cook it for your roommates, but you do season it with Griffin's special

52:23.340 --> 52:27.140
stuff, and then when they eat it, they're like, wow, this tastes so bad, and you're

52:27.140 --> 52:30.940
like, hmm, I guess the air fryer sucks, and then they won't want to use it because of

52:30.940 --> 52:34.020
the bad taste I put on it with mide powder.

52:34.020 --> 52:36.380
I see.

52:36.380 --> 52:39.900
I mean, I guess, here's the thing, Griffin, I'm having a hard time coming up with jokes

52:39.900 --> 52:42.660
because that's such a good idea.

52:42.660 --> 52:48.900
And then there's other uses for Griffin's rancid shit powder is like a prank against

52:48.900 --> 52:52.260
a school bully.

52:52.260 --> 52:54.460
Convince your dog not to eat something.

52:54.460 --> 52:59.900
Convince your dog, maybe keep a tongue off for the doggy, prank against the school principal.

52:59.900 --> 53:03.820
Justin, what would you use Griffin's rancid shit powder on?

53:03.820 --> 53:07.380
What would you put it on?

53:07.380 --> 53:08.380
Tiny popcorn.

53:08.380 --> 53:13.300
Well, yeah, here's the thing, there's definitely, people drink malort, there's definitely some

53:13.300 --> 53:16.100
people who would want to eat Griffin's rancid shit powder.

53:16.100 --> 53:21.700
It's not made out of actual shit, it's synthetic, chemical, I would not make people eat poop

53:21.700 --> 53:24.580
as a joke, because that's a crime.

53:24.580 --> 53:27.420
But you wouldn't make them eat it as a bet, right?

53:27.420 --> 53:33.140
No, no, it's not poop, it's not poop, but the principal, oh my god.

53:33.140 --> 53:39.420
I hate him so much, and I would love it if his lunch could have a bad stink on it.

53:39.420 --> 53:45.380
Here's the thing, he's so uptight, he's so uptight, and you know what, before you feel

53:45.380 --> 53:49.060
bad about it, he's been embezzling from the school.

53:49.060 --> 53:52.980
I didn't want anybody writing in saying like, I'm a principal and someone made me eat rancid

53:52.980 --> 53:55.860
shit powder, and I felt terrible about it for days.

53:55.860 --> 53:58.900
Like, well, you're probably not an embezzler, so that's probably fine.

53:58.900 --> 54:02.500
Justin, what else would you do with my shit powder?

54:02.500 --> 54:07.700
Folks, this has been a great episode, my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the

54:07.700 --> 54:08.700
modern era.

54:08.700 --> 54:12.020
We hope you've enjoyed yourself as much as we have.

54:12.020 --> 54:14.820
We've had so much fun this week.

54:14.820 --> 54:19.940
A quick announcement, if you are in the area, I think we still have some tickets if you

54:19.940 --> 54:27.820
want to come see us in Indianapolis or Nashville here in like a week and a half or so.

54:27.820 --> 54:31.620
Or rather a couple days, because this is going up on Monday.

54:31.620 --> 54:32.620
Correct?

54:32.620 --> 54:33.620
Yeah.

54:33.620 --> 54:34.620
So that'll be what?

54:34.620 --> 54:35.620
The what?

54:35.620 --> 54:36.620
The 10th?

54:36.620 --> 54:38.500
So you're like five days.

54:38.500 --> 54:42.560
We're going to be in Nashville, be at the Ryman on June 14th and 15th.

54:42.560 --> 54:44.620
That's the adventure zone of Mobinbam, respectively.

54:44.620 --> 54:47.980
Then June 16th, we're going to be in Indianapolis at Clouds Memorial Hall.

54:47.980 --> 54:50.060
And that's June 16th.

54:50.060 --> 54:53.580
You can get tickets at bit.ly forward slash become the monster.

54:53.580 --> 54:56.500
And we got a bunch of other shows up there.

54:56.500 --> 55:00.620
We're doing a book tour this July, and then we got a bunch more shows you can go buy tickets

55:00.620 --> 55:01.620
for.

55:01.620 --> 55:02.620
A lot of them have sold out.

55:02.620 --> 55:06.780
So if you haven't bought tickets yet, please come and come and do so.

55:06.780 --> 55:07.780
We'd love to see you.

55:07.780 --> 55:14.180
And also, we are actually adding two more adventure zone stops on the on the grand cross

55:14.180 --> 55:16.340
country trip that we're taking.

55:16.340 --> 55:21.940
We are going to be doing Taz in San Diego during Comic Con at the Balboa Theater on

55:21.940 --> 55:24.900
Saturday, July 20th.

55:24.900 --> 55:31.140
And then we are adding a show in Washington, D.C. at the Constitution Hall.

55:31.140 --> 55:34.940
And that's going to be Wednesday, September 25th.

55:34.940 --> 55:38.860
Both of those are going to be Taz shows and tickets for those go on sale this Friday,

55:38.860 --> 55:43.380
June 14th at noon, local time, local to where the shows are taking place.

55:43.380 --> 55:45.620
So don't don't sleep on those either.

55:45.620 --> 55:48.940
We've got merch, go check out the merch.

55:48.940 --> 55:51.700
Yeah, there's new merch.

55:51.700 --> 55:54.240
Don't do a hit pin.

55:54.240 --> 55:58.260
There's a bean juice mugs are still available.

55:58.260 --> 56:02.740
If you could just please, for the love of God, just please.

56:02.740 --> 56:03.740
We bought so many.

56:03.740 --> 56:06.620
Maybe you bought one for someone you love and they got it and they loved it.

56:06.620 --> 56:11.220
And maybe you accidentally knock it off the counter and it breaks and you got to buy a

56:11.220 --> 56:13.260
new one.

56:13.260 --> 56:16.940
Have you noticed you don't see people talking about bean juice as much as they do about

56:16.940 --> 56:19.340
other classic My Brother, My Brother, Me Bits?

56:19.340 --> 56:20.900
Yeah, us too.

56:20.900 --> 56:23.020
And we bought so many of these fucking mugs.

56:46.340 --> 56:50.440
Don't explain to NBC why you sent them a bunch of bean juice mugs, but that might be the

key to saving bean juice.

56:53.020 --> 56:56.700
