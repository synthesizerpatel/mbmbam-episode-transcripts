00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:44.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take your chance on me If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
One, two, three, and fuck it, it's The McElroy Brothers, back for another MV, MV AM.

00:53.000 --> 01:06.000
I feel like here on the advice show for the modern era, we can curse a lot more now that we have Bob Ball telling people, watch out, cursing.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
I actually, I have Bob Ball following me around all the time just to do that, like, watch out, Travis is about to curse.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
This guy's about to say some shit.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh, I'm sorry, I just did it. I just cursed in the disclaimer.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
And then he has a guy that follows him around that says Bob Ball is about to curse when he tells you Travis is about to curse.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
And hey, pretty soon, everybody's employed. You're welcome, Obama.

01:29.000 --> 01:37.000
Hey guys, happy 20th anniversary of the very first show we did. Can you believe it?

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
I cannot believe it.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
It seems like only 21 weeks ago.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
It was.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
It was.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
It was.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Sorry about that one.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Hey, here on the advice show for the modern era, we take your questions and turn them into wisdom.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
It's Alchemy, and I'm going to kick it off right now.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
I'm almost 30 years old and I've never really had a nickname, says FormSpring.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
I think FormSpring is a pretty good nickname, but let's move on.

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
I'm starting a new job soon, and I think this might be my last chance. Should I just introduce myself as Highway or Hunter?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Or do you have any other suggestions?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Highway Hunter.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah, I was going to say Highway Hunter, but Highway to Heaven.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
I'm Landon.

02:21.000 --> 02:33.000
Whatever it is, it has to be something that refers to either some sort of trait, some sort of physical trait or some sort of physical item that you wear around.

02:33.000 --> 02:43.000
For instance, one year I went to church camp, and I had this new pair of shitty sunglasses, and I referred to myself exclusively as Shades.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
That's why whenever I walk into a room, I say, Hi, my name's Cock Ring.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Hi, I'm Skinny Jeans.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Whatever it is, you've got to devote yourself to it.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
You can't waver.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
That's the thing about it.

02:59.000 --> 03:08.000
If you roll up in a church camp and you say, What's up, they call me Shades, and then you go off that for a second, you'll never hear the end of it.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah, the trick is to pretend like this name has been given to you.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
I don't even remember my real name.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
If it doesn't say Shades on my birth certificate, I don't know.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Exactly.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
I don't know.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
People have been calling me Shades for so long that I don't really remember what my real name is.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Because it's got to be like back in school and you've got to have a backstory.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
You've got to have a convincing backstory for this name.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
It doesn't have to be a good one.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
The important thing is that it's a casual backstory, not something you've thought about.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
It can't be intricate.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
They call me Funyuns.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Why?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
I like Funyuns.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
I like them.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
They call me Red because I like red.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
I don't know.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I like red a lot.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Better than that.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
I think what would be great though is if you picked another name as your nickname.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
If you're like, hi, my name is Travis, but people call me Ignacio.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Just don't make it make sense.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I think that's the way to go.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Or in reality, don't give yourself a nickname.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Do not give yourself a nickname.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
You just got to pretend.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
You don't give it to yourself.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
You pretend it was given to you by a group that these people will never ever meet.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
So not long ago, this is Leo from Gmail, not long ago, a girl I really liked asked me out

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
on a date.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
It went well, even to the point of her coming up with a whole bunch of ideas for follow

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
up dates.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Okay.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Pre-planning.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Good.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Thinking this meant she dug me, I decided to ask her to our high school prom.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
She said no, even though she didn't have another date and even came and gloated to me when

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
she did find one.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Since then, she's ignored me completely.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
This wouldn't be a problem, except we'll both be going to the same university.

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
We'll be in the same faculty and we'll both be living in res starting in a couple of maybe

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
residency halls.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Something like that.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I think so.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Starting in a couple of weeks.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
So since I'll probably be seeing her somewhat regularly in the next while, how do I make

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
things less awkward?

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Unfortunately, packing up and leaving isn't an option.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Damn it.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Damn it.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
That's our A material.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Thanks.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Keep up the great work, Leo.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
My real question is, Leo, what did you do?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
What did you do?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Yeah, Leo.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Shit's on you.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
She was planning other dates.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
How gnarly was that gas you ripped at the end where she was like, never again.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
This is the worst toot in history.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
The toot heard around the world.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
The toot heard around the world.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Leo, here's something for you to nosh on.

05:44.000 --> 05:52.000
Maybe since you were the one that was wronged in this scenario, maybe you shouldn't be sweating.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
How awkward it is.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Maybe you, Leo, should be just riding that awkward wave.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Give her the pretend you don't know who she is.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
That'll go good.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Oh, I like that.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
You like that?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Yeah.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Yeah.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
I think that's pretty good.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Griffin, how do you make things less awkward with girls like this?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
I shit you not.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Packing up and moving away is one of the few options.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Otherwise, time's going to heal those wounds.

06:21.000 --> 06:29.000
Really, you're going to meet so many new people at university, as you say, that I really don't

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
think it's going to be a big deal, man.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
That's the thing.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
I don't know what school you're going to, but most of them are big enough that you're

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
not going to see her.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
You might see her two times in the next year, so don't worry about it.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
But if you do see her, just punch her right in the face.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
No, don't punch her in the face.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Travis, don't punch her in the face.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I'm sorry.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
My fault.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
I get caught up sometimes.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
When are we going to get a new brother?

06:55.000 --> 07:01.000
I am a single young gentleman who relies on the advice from others as a formative measure.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
When talking to people, I often find myself giving anecdotes and metaphors too frequently.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Even I will admit that most are pointless and or boring.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Am I being rude or do I need to refine these skills?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Please help, Simon.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
I don't see why I can't be both, Simon, but maybe you are being rude and yes, you need

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
to get better at that.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Travis, do you have any advice for him?

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
You can never use anecdotes and metaphors too frequently.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
In fact, you should only speak in metaphors.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
Okay, well, that's probably, maybe Travis wasn't the one I should have turned to for

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
wisdom on this.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
To be fair, I don't know what a metaphor is.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
I can't remember if that's the one with like her ass.

07:47.000 --> 07:55.000
You would probably be well to remember that there's nothing that says you have to speak

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
in any given moment.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
Sometimes I'll mull over five to ten different things I could say in a given situation and

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
then wait till I come up with a really good one and then say that because a lot of times

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
if you talk and don't really think about it before you talk, you'll just, well, you'll

08:13.000 --> 08:21.000
be recording the show, but sometimes people will let you host a podcast, but it's not

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
the best way to entertain.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Try asking more questions.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
As far as being rude goes, Justin pretty much hit it on the head there is the rudeness comes

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
from taking up all of the space in the conversation or in the room.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
If you're a real fatty, that's what it is too.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
I still don't understand how using metaphors in a conversation is rude.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Maybe they're like overly long metaphors.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
Like today is like a day that it's a simile.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
It's like a sun.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
See, okay, so metaphor is the one with ass, right?

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
That would be like saying today is a sun.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Today is a sun.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
Maybe, maybe his metaphor is you're a pussy.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Maybe he's confusing metaphor with your mama jokes.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Yeah.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Are you not dropping enough of those?

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Because those are pretty important for social skills.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
In the end, you just need to focus and think about what you're saying before you say it

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
because if it's not something that you would like to hear, then chances are other people

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
wouldn't like to hear it either.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Also, listen to a lot.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I'm going to write that down.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
Listen to a lot of stand up comedy and steal it.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Just cold house it and no one will be the wiser.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Yahoo answers user Moli.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
Moli asks, oh, and this question was sent in by TJ Madd.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Thank you, TJ Madd.

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
Moli asks, how do you treat someone with an obsession with sticky buns?

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
I'm sick of the questions and the buns are mounting.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
So is the mold.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
He won't talk about anything else.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
You will see him on Yahoo.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
He's the one with an obsession with sticky buns.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
That was a fully formed sentence.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
That was my favorite episode of Hoarders.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Did you guys see that one?

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
I think it was subtitled A Sticky Situation.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
I really I guess the only thing you can do is get them hooked on an even more delicious

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
food, although you'd be hard pressed.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
It's super doughnut.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Jesus.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
I'm obsessed with super doughnuts, but the fact that I'm not in elementary school keeps

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
me from eating them for every meal.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
What's up with super doughnuts?

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Does anybody have any of those right now in this podcast?

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
If you work at a school, a public institution, we will trade you wampum style super doughnuts

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
for t-shirts.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
It's a new initiative, the super doughnuts for t-shirts initiative.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
They're full of nutrients.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
They're full of a lot of super doughnuts.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
They are so full of nutrients and full of flavor and they're always soggy.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Always.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
Except that last bit because they're microwaved and that last bit is always the last bit is

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
hard like a like some sort of doughnut scab.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
That's where the nutrients are.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
You got to suck the nutrients out.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
But you wait, wait, wait.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Don't tell me you've been eating that.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
That's the rind.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I didn't know.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
That's that's nature's handle.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
You're not supposed to eat that part of the super doughnut.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
That's disgusting.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
When I moved into my new house, the gas station right by sold super doughnuts and they were

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
right between like the bongs and the lottery tickets.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
There was just a big box of super doughnuts.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
That sounds like the coolest apartment of that gas station.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
It is.

11:31.000 --> 11:37.000
So do you think there are people who went to school in places where there weren't super

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
doughnuts that have literally no idea what we're talking about?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
We sound like mad people, like just crazy people.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Like people that don't know what breakfast pizza is?

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
Just Google it and you'll find out.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
But basically, they're delicious doughnuts with nutrients and a rind.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
I'm a guy and I'm thinking of shaving my legs.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
If so, how far up the leg should I shave?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
What are your thoughts on men shaving legs from form spring?

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Bitch, what do you think our thoughts are?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
I'll tell you how far up you should shave.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
Not not up, but to the ankle, to the ankle.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Shave your just the top of your foot and your knuckles.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
Shave your foot, Bilbo.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
The answer is either not at all or all the way.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Yeah.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I don't want any of this half-ass shit.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
I want you to shave it.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
Inner thigh, outer calf.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
And just a lightning bolt that goes.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Leg like a hairy checkerboard.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
That's what I want.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Carve your basketball jersey number into your inner thigh hair.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Better yet, carve mine and we'll be going steady.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
You shouldn't shave your leg.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Don't shave your legs.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Unless you're a swimmer.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
If you're a swimmer.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
If you're a professional swimmer or runner.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
I bet that Michael Phelps shaves his legs and he could beat the shit out of me.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
He's just all arms and sinew, isn't he?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Yes, he's like some kind of pterodactyl.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Like a pterodactyl.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
He's like an antelope.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
He's like half antelope.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Half antelope, half pterodactyl.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
Can you think of any other reason for shaving your legs other than I'm a professional athlete?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, if you're a drag queen.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
If you're a what?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
A drag queen.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
If you're a drag queen.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
And what I've learned from RuPaul's Drag U is that almost all drag queens are helpful and wise.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
They're the wizards of the modern generation.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
They are the wizards.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
If you're starting a quest, don't even trip.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Don't even hang out with that wizard.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Just skip to a drag queen.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
They know everything.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
They've seen the Quinn from both sides and they like it.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
They like what they saw.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I met the most beautiful girl.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
This is from Andrew, Gmail.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen last night.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
And she's single, so I want to take a shot at her.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Whoa.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Whoa.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Easy there, DC Sniper.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Yeah.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Let's chill out.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
The problem is I'm doing a semester-long program in DC.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Oh, shit.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Oh, God.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Oh, damn it.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
No.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
I'm leaving today.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
Should I add her on Facebook and keep in touch while I'm in DC?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Whew.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
Or just see what happens when I get back in December so I don't seem creepy by adding

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
her after hanging out with her only once.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Andrew from Gmail.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Don't add her on Facebook.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Oh, add her.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Add her.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
No one.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
You cares.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
I had people that I talked to once in high school that I do not remember, but apparently

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
remember me.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Facebook adding doesn't matter.

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
Well, he can add her, but what's he going to keep in touch with to kind of keep that

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
first-time meeting energy alive?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
You know what I mean?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Hey, remember that time at Sparrow?

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
We had that three-minute-long conversation, there were sparks.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
You remember the sparks?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
The Sparrow sparks?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
It was delicious.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
If you've already made that initial connection, if you've already talked to her and hung out

14:44.000 --> 14:50.000
a little bit, Facebook is a pretty good way to sort of stay in touch, to stay in the loop.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
You can follow what she's doing.

14:51.000 --> 15:00.000
But also, it can be a great tool for managing her love life until you return to be her special

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
guy.

15:01.000 --> 15:08.000
So, if she says on her status, met an interesting guy tonight, might go somewhere, and you comment

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
on that status.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
Well, let's not be too hasty.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Let's really think about this.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
How well do you know him?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Have you seen the latest AIDS stats?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Everyone's got it.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
They're pretty AIDS-y, so maybe you should just think about that.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Oh, is it Rick?

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
Who hasn't Rick been with?

15:30.000 --> 15:38.000
Yeah, just add her on Facebook, because A, it doesn't matter, and B, if she is interested,

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
then that's kind of a way of, you know, you showing that you're interested.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Kind of a sad way, but...

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Yeah, kind of a way to make her want to...

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
Makes me wish that you thought I was cute so you'd shoot me.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
FormSpring asks, Hi Mubim Bam.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
I just dyed my hair fuchsia, and I am now thinking of the next color that I am going

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
to do.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
I am a girl, so the pinks and purples are okay.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
What do you think would be a good color?

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
Thank you in advance, Tony.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
I think it's thank you in advance, comma, Tony.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Oh.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
Tony, you are always such a pretty girl.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
Tony, I remember brushing out your long brown hair and saying to everybody, she looks just

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
like a princess.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
She looks like a young Linda Carter, is what I used to tell people.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
I wish you would just dye it brown.

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
Just dye it brown so you could be that girl we all remember and come home.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
We miss you, Tony.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Tony, come home.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
We miss you.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
The big city does swallow you up.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
The city swallows you up, Tony.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Come back.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
I'm so down with fuchsia-colored hair.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
I'm down with it, Tony.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I think it's great.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
I think next color, how about lime green?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Whoa.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Actually, I like that.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
You went out there.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Why don't you dye it lime green?

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
When people comment on it, say, you know, got to get that money.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
People will be like, what?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
It's a reminder to get that money.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Tony, are you all about getting that money?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Because if so, I would say green.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
I would say Tony with an I, all about that money.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
She's got to get that cheddar, right?

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Is she one of the Tonys like Tony, Tony, Tony?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Because then it's all about the money.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Whoa.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Did you ask Tony and Tony what colors they're going with?

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
There's nothing worse than showing up to record Poison 2 and people will be like, and Tony.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
That was Belle, Biv, DeVoe.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Oh, snap.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Can you edit this out?

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
I'm actually going to forward it to Belle and Biv.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
But not DeVoe.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Fuck him.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
DeVoe died.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Let's move on to my next question.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Oh, no.

17:53.000 --> 18:00.000
This comes from, this next question says, no one remembers that I recorded Poison.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
What should I do?

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
DeVoe.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
So sad.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
It's so sad.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
God.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I feel like the momentum is completely off now.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
You know what will pick it back up?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
What?

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
Yeah, this question was sent in by Christopher, Yahoo Answers user DK.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I always screw that up.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
What did Tony, Tony, Tony do?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Tony, Tony, Tony.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I honest to God, I couldn't tell you.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Griffin, you read the question.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
I'll do a little googling.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
If I had no loot.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Here we go.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
DK asks, how should I wear a flannel shirt without looking bad?

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
Now, listen, there's a matrix of options here.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
We need to come up with an algorithm using these metrics that DK has provided.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Okay.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Options.

18:50.000 --> 18:57.000
White v-neck, black wife beater, white wife beater, black crew neck, gray crew neck, no undershirt.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
How many buttons undone?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Zero, one, two, three, etc.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Bonus.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
What type of jeans?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Add or deduct things.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
I am a guy.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
I am skinny.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
I have short hair.

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
First off, I want to say how much I appreciate him going through the different numbers of buttons.

19:17.000 --> 19:24.000
Because sometimes I get hitched between two and four and I have to remember, ah shit, three.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
That's the one.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
It is a red, black plaid flannel shirt.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
He has one shirt that he is dying to wear, but he's just eyeballing it from across the room trying to figure it out.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
He gots to wear it the right way.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
I want to wear this shirt.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
I have one flannel shirt that grants me wishes and I have to wear it.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
DK, hold on to your asshole.

19:47.000 --> 19:57.000
White V-neck, all buttons undone, wrapped around your waist, torn, faded, light blue jeans.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I love it.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
That's the Joey Lawrence is what I call that look.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
Whoa, you just blew my fashion mind.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Turn it into a flannel kilt.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
That's what I'm saying.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah, but not a utility kilt because I'll leap through the internet.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I'll fucking strangle you.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
Justin, I believe you were looking for House Party 2 from the House Party 2 soundtrack.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I think that was their big hit.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
The House Party 2 soundtrack had a song on it by Tony Tony Tony called House Party 2.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Wait, wait, wait.

20:30.000 --> 20:38.000
I can't tear down anybody's knowledge of Tony Tony Tony, but you think that House Party 2 was maybe their big song?

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
It reached number 19 on the US R&B charts.

20:42.000 --> 20:49.000
You guys remember when Will Smith did that track on the Independence Day soundtrack called Independence Day?

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
That reached number 19 on the hip hop and soul charts if I remember correctly.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Welcome to Earth, welcome to Earth, welcome, welcome.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
Welcome to Earth, welcome to Earth, welcome, welcome.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
Can we get back to the narrative subject at hand?

21:01.000 --> 21:07.000
Can you just read the last couple sentences again, just the part with just the whole thing?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Add or deduct things.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
I am a guy. I am skinny. I have short hair.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
It sounds so defensive.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
It sounds like a math problem.

21:22.000 --> 21:30.000
If one douchebag is traveling at 50 miles an hour to Hollister to get a goofy looking red and black flannel shirt,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
how many buttons should he button up?

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
Add or deduct the fact that he is skinny and has short hair.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
Why do you feel the need to wear this shirt?

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
It sounds like he's causing you a lot of consternation.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Maybe just throw it.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
I think the better question is how many failed attempts has he had at wearing this shirt?

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
He just comes home dejected and strips it off and goes, today wasn't my day.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I can't do it internet.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Clothes but no cigar.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
Do you think he's sitting in his room with like three blackboards surrounding him?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
He's just like madly doing arithmetic.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
You have to come out and eat.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
Shut up mom, I'm figuring out the shirt continuum.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
No undershirt, one button undone.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Blue jeans.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Honey, we're supposed to be married today.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Why are you saying these things?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Just say I do.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
No, no jeans. Short hair.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I'm a guy. I am skinny.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
So you want to name your child.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
The name you want me to put on the birth certificate is one button.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Black crew neck.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I'm skinny. I am a guy.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Fanny pack?

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
For one week, all that's written on the board is just dry letters.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
Fanny pack with a big question mark at the end.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
It's been 30 years and I've never even considered fanny packs.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Fanny pack!

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
As he slowly chews on the end of his glasses and then just erases the board and cries.

22:58.000 --> 23:06.000
He finally solves it and in celebration he tips over his blackboard and tears the shirt in half.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
I'm B.E. you flannel bitch!

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Rod Serling is like, what's up Twilight Zone?

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Deal with it. We're out of ideas.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
And I'm dead.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
Forum Spring asks, Dear Mabim Bam, what's the best way to meet nerdy single women?

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
Science nerds, video game nerds, animation nerds, movie nerds, whatever.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
BTW, I mean non lesbians.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Overstocked on them, thank you.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Regards, single player.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Ooh, I like that.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Can everyone start whenever they ask questions?

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
Can they give either like little nicknames like that that are appropriate to the question that they're asking?

23:40.000 --> 23:46.000
Or like, Forlorn and Frankfurt or something like that?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Yeah, I like that.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
Griffin, you should know this.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Oh, should I?

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
I do really well at this actually.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Do you?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
No.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
They, for the most part, don't exist.

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
They are cryptozoological in nature.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
They're often seen riding unicorns and such.

24:14.000 --> 24:25.000
Yeah, I mean, the best thing you can do is just bounce from GameStop to GameStop just looking for a cute cashier.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
With a net.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
With a net, yeah.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
You have to put her in a net, whatever.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
No, don't put anyone in a net.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
I really don't know what to tell you.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Facebook's pretty cool.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
The internet's alright.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
You can meet lots of people in that.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
Why don't you go to PAX?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Yeah, go to PAX.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Go to some sort of convention.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
But, I don't know.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
They're not looking to meet dudes.

24:53.000 --> 25:01.000
You put an attractive girl at a video game or nerdy convention, it's just like chum for nerd sharks.

25:01.000 --> 25:10.000
I just, also, I don't think you should be, I don't think anyone should use that as a metric for people that you're looking for.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
I don't think anyone should ever be like, oh, I need to find a partner.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
How about someone who's nerdy?

25:16.000 --> 25:24.000
I don't think anyone, like that shouldn't be, there's so many other qualities that are more important than that when looking for another person.

25:24.000 --> 25:32.000
That's a great point, because if I had asked this question ten years ago, I mean, this is probably the sort of thing that I would be looking for, right?

25:32.000 --> 25:45.000
Somebody who has similar interest to me, but now that I'm older, I mean, my wife and I don't, we don't have any interests that are similar.

25:45.000 --> 25:53.000
We like really disparate things, but we get along probably a little bit better because of that, because we have different spheres of interest.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
And the important thing is her nerdiness about certain things is something you find out.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
It's not like you're going to look at her across the room and be like, oh my god, there's a huge video game nerd.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
You get to know someone and find out what their interests are.

26:07.000 --> 26:13.000
Anybody who makes it that obvious, it's probably an affectation, which is not something you want to be attracted to.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
And they're probably dressed like a Final Fantasy character, and you don't want to talk to them anyway.

26:17.000 --> 26:23.000
This is a question that Griffin's going to be able to knock out of the park, so I'm just going to ask it.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
I'm a member of my high school cross-country team, which means I have an hour of jogging a day or more.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
Oh, you show off. The problem is, as I get it, OK, we all get it.

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
The problem is, as a sensible alternative rock and indie music fan, TMBG and Sufjan Stevens-

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Wrong!

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Quite.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
It's Sufjan.

26:42.000 --> 26:48.000
Sufi? Sufjan? Sufjan. OK, let me try again.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
TMBG and Sufjan Stevens are not kind of fist pumping.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Hi, I'm 29 years old, OK?

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
You're lucky I can turn my computer on, you slut, so shut up.

26:59.000 --> 27:04.000
Do you guys have any suggestions for music that would get me pumped up for jogging long distances?

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Russ, Gmail.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Here, how about this?

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
Yeah, turn us up.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
Running and running and running.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
One foot, next foot, next foot, next foot.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
The answer, of course, is Neil Diamond.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Cranked up as loud as I can go.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Yeah, maybe.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
I actually listen to a lot of podcasts whenever I'm doing my walk around the neighborhood.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
Not my jog. Maybe that's missing something.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Maybe you should stop.

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
Maybe you should quit the cross-country running team and join the cross-country walking team.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
And then listen to podcasts.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Cross-block, cross-neighborhood walking team.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Other than that, man, just find something with fast beat.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
Maybe a Daft Punk, maybe an LCD sound system.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Something to just, you know, get the blood pumping.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
Get that Fix Up, Look Sharp.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
Fix Up, Look Sharp? Yeah, anything off the DJ Hero soundtrack.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Yeah, get the DJ Hero soundtrack.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
That's good.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
And you know what?

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Maybe you're not listening to the right They Might Be Giants songs,

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
because there are some of those that are upbeat and get you pumped.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
Can I recommend the House Party 2 soundtrack?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
What was that one song on there?

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
You were talking about House Party 2.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
I have a real problem with listening to music whenever I'm running,

28:22.000 --> 28:29.000
because I don't have one of those sleek little iPod baby iPods

28:29.000 --> 28:36.000
that you slide into your arm, into your cyborg arm, that just kind of stays there.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Did you say cyborg?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
No, cyborg.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I have like a big Zune.

28:42.000 --> 28:48.000
I have like a big 30-Googlebyte Zune that any time I run it just jangles around in my pocket.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Right.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
It makes me look silly.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Are you running a lot more than I knew about?

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Is this a big problem for you?

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
There's a lot of people chasing Griffin in his new neighborhood.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
I've been doing a bit of exercise, yes.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Is that okay?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I mean, I don't want anybody growing.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
No, you should grow.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I want you to grow as a person.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
I feel I am.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
But it's important that you don't surpass us.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
You can catch up to me, and then you've got to stop.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Yeah, just get a good design.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
That shouldn't be too hard.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
I am 27, and my husband is 28.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
We are coming up on 30,

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
and I'm wondering if there is something that we should do before we hit 30.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
We don't have kids, so we don't have to worry about that,

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
and we don't want kids, so please don't say have children.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
We live in upstate New York and have a bit of money saved up.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Any suggestions?

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Tony.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Also with an I.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Wait a minute.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Tony's getting a two for this week.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Congratulations, Tony.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
You're lucky Travis is negligent.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
No, it's a completely different Tony.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Oh, okay, sure.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
This is Tony Collette.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
I think you should act.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Just act as much as you can as Collette.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
You're a real talent.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
You're a treasure.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
Hollywood treasure, Tony Collette.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Upstate New York.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Okay, I have a few suggestions.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
You could, they're skydiving.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
If you say we're on a cross-country amusement park trip.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Rocky Mountain Climb?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
You got to stop.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
How about buy an apple orchard?

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Whoa.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
I like that.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
You got to buy something, right?

30:29.000 --> 30:35.000
When you turn 30, you have to buy something as a gift to yourself for not dying for 30 years.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
I really think an apple orchard in upstate New York would be a real treat.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Get some farm hands.

30:41.000 --> 30:50.000
When you see people doing weird things in their 60s, they had to have a moment earlier where like they decided to do that.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
And this has to be your moment.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
We're like, how did you guys get an apple orchard?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
It's like, well, we just.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
At turn 30, we didn't want to have kids.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
These apples are our kids.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Please stop eating my baby.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
David.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
David.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
He wasn't even ripe yet, you bastard.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Your baby's really mealy.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Do you want another slice of bread pie?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
We made it this morning.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
It's full of bread, our baby.

31:15.000 --> 31:21.000
So what we're saying to you is you should have an apple orchard and you should make the apples your babies.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
And Sharpie on faces on every single one.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
I mean, Sharpie faces.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
It doesn't have to be an apple orchard, but it has to be something big and irresponsible.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
It has to be some kind of orchard.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
Yeah, but make sure it has to be something you have no idea how to take care of.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
It has to be like in three months.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
A llama farm.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Oh shit.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
All our alpacas are dead.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
These alpacas are dead as fuck.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
We did not think about this before we did it.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
I like that.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Do that one.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
My best friend lives about 1.5 hours away.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
That's 90 minutes.

31:57.000 --> 32:03.000
And every time she comes into town, she demands that we hang out all the time.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
Now, I would love to, but I have a life aside from her, a job, and sometimes I'm just tired at the end of the day.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
And not in the social mind to hang out.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
I tell her and she keeps demanding.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
What should I say to her?

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
Or am I just not appreciating our friendship as much as her?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Hey, do you guys remember that question?

32:18.000 --> 32:25.000
I think it was like last week or the week before that where someone talked about how they went in town to hang out with their best friend, but they didn't want to hang out with them.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Uh-huh.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Uh-oh.

32:29.000 --> 32:38.000
We've actually received this question a couple times, and thank you for listening when I said to send it again because I forget all the past questions.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
I don't know if they're related, but if so, apologies.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
I think you just got to bite the bullet.

32:45.000 --> 32:53.000
If I have a friend in town, I'll hang out with them even if I'm not even particularly close friends with them or don't want to hang out.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
My friend is an hour and a half away.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
It's not like she moved to Nebraska or something.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
She probably sees her once a week.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
You know what I mean?

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
It's not that epic a deal that she's in town.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
I love how you think Nebraska isn't close to anything.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
Nebraska is universally far away from every point on the globe.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
To be fair, I meant to say Alaska, and it came out as Nebraska.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Regardless.

33:17.000 --> 33:22.000
Earlier, I meant to say Bilbo Devoe, and it came out as Tony Tony Tony.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
That's my fault.

33:25.000 --> 33:30.000
I meant to say house party, too, and it came out as poison.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
Yeah, just drop her if you don't want to hang out.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Yeah, sorry.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
If you don't want to hang out with her, then that means that you don't want to hang out with her.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
And this and there is a quick solution to that problem.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
That means like it's it's not being a friend anymore.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
You could come up with like creative like, you know, I can't.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
I have the flu or crabs or something.

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
But you could keep coming up with those lies, but eventually you're going to get sick of that, too.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
And just straight up be like, listen, I don't want to hang out every time you come in town.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I have other things to do.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
If that bothers you, I am sorry.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Because really, what are you out?

34:08.000 --> 34:13.000
Like if she gets really mad and doesn't talk to you for like two months, then what are you missing there?

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
I mean, she could go like she could go swim fan on her ass.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Oh, shit.

34:17.000 --> 34:23.000
She could start she could start leaving like dead small animals in her front seat of her car.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
Like it's a it's a thorny situation, which is.

34:29.000 --> 34:38.000
Which is why I almost always tell people to pack up and just get the thing is, you can't leave a 40 and that's because swim fans will check the track you down.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
Why not split the difference and tell her you're moving away?

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
Tell her you're moving to Nebraska and you will come visit her.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
When you can.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Yeah, that's the only thing you can do is retaliate.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Don't even move away.

34:51.000 --> 34:58.000
Just go and visit her like every other day and just be a big useless lump whenever you're hanging out.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Just don't talk to her.

34:59.000 --> 35:08.000
Just just say I like your presence or go up there and have her decline you and just be lonely all day and see how she's living.

35:08.000 --> 35:13.000
Yeah, because that then the shoe will be on the other proverbial foot.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Deal with that.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I have a Yahoo answers question.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
OK, it's from Dave one, but it was sent in by T.J.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Mad is my second T.J.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Mad question of the show.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
He's a real hero.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Thank you, T.J.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Man.

35:28.000 --> 35:36.000
Dave one asks and to really appreciate the comedy of this question, you have to understand that it's in all caps.

35:36.000 --> 35:45.000
OK, he asks, why do we scream or shout loudly when frightened or excited?

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
For example, when on a fast ride or something makes you jump.

35:49.000 --> 35:55.000
What's the purpose of making a loud noise?

35:55.000 --> 36:00.000
I mean, it's it's it's really dumb and poorly worded, but he's got a point.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
What are we doing?

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
We're wasting our throat meat all these years on screaming for no reason.

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
Next time you go to King's Island and you're on the vortex, just losing your mind.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
Just oh, oh, give it one of those.

36:14.000 --> 36:20.000
It's so fast.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
I used to I got I got into a kick.

36:24.000 --> 36:30.000
And I think probably everybody gets to this phase when I would go on roller coasters.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
And, you know, they take your picture.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
I with everybody screaming, I thought, you know what I'll do?

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
I'll just look super cool.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
And then and then everybody screaming, I'll be like, what's up?

36:40.000 --> 36:46.000
But I found that like maybe it's because of the gravity or or because of like the internal terror.

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
But like it always looked like seven people having the time of their life.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
One guy trying not to poop.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
The picture always looked like it sounds like I'm just going to do the screaming thing because maybe that's why.

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
Because it's either scream or look in the picture like you're trying not to poop.

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
I always give the I always give two middle fingers up, point them up.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
Give two middle fingers because it lets people know how edgy I am.

37:12.000 --> 37:19.000
And that that fucking King's Island attendant who's all whose job is to sit and look at pictures of people having fun all day.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Like worst job ever.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
He sees someone giving the double deuce and he's like he watch him.

37:25.000 --> 37:30.000
I keep an eye on him and that picture loads up and gives a little unknowing smile.

37:30.000 --> 37:36.000
What I do is I flash my boobies and it's because I'm whimsical because I'm fun.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
And I'm also a little bit sexy.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
You know what I mean?

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
She's a little crazy, a little wild.

37:43.000 --> 37:49.000
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

37:49.000 --> 37:55.000
But before I do, we have a couple of quick housekeeping things, just reminders, basically.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
First off, as always, thank you.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Thank you. Thank you.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
You're telling people about the show.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
You're tweeting about the show.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
We love to see to see that.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
Gotta give a shout out to my man, Nick Suttner.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
He's he's in Suttner on Twitter if you want to follow him.

38:12.000 --> 38:20.000
But he he promotes the show every single week, tells people, hey, there's a new one of these out.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
You should go listen to it.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Ditto for Xander Davis Live.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
He's another one that was talking about the program.

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
So Charlene five one nine on Twitter is passing it out to her friends.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
Someone passed it to her and now she's telling other people about it.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Thank you for that.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
It forward pay.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
Always said that it.

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
I would also like to thank Kate Nash on our Facebook appreciation group.

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
She posted a picture of her holding the postcard that she's sending to Tristan.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Thank you so much for that, Kate.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
That's so sweet.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
Everyone. Oh, the address for Tristan's on the Facebook group.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
So if you want to send him he's our favorite Marine.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
We've seen gotten a couple.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
I got a mail from last last week.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
He seems to be doing pretty good.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
And thanks, everybody.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Oh, thanks to bought T-shirts, too.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Oh, yeah.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Those should be going out from what we've heard.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
All the pre-order shirts are out and about in the world.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Do you want to hear a confession?

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Yeah, I just ordered my shirt today.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
You piece of shit.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
What?

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
I assume they would send me one.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
My name is on it.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
I bought mine.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I bought both of mine.

39:32.000 --> 39:39.000
So if you if you want to be like Travis and buy a shirt, you can go to MBNBAM.com.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Click buy stuff.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
There's a link to two shirts.

39:42.000 --> 39:48.000
If you pre-order shirt is in the mail and other orders are being processed as they come.

39:48.000 --> 39:53.000
I'm seeing a lot of people putting up pics of them wearing the shirt on Twitter.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
I think we're going to collect all those, put them somewhere either on the side or maybe on the on the on the T-shirt site.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
So keep what's the best way just to email us links or what you should do is.

40:01.000 --> 40:07.000
Just put them on Facebook and then link them in the Facebook group, which which we have.

40:07.000 --> 40:11.000
And I don't think we've talked about in a while, but we have a Facebook group.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
It's my brother, my brother and me appreciation group.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
You got to search for the whole thing.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
So put your pictures on there and then we'll grab them from there.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
And also, you know, it helps spread the word.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
People like, hey, what's that really fresh, comfortable looking shirt all about?

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
If you don't use FB, you can tweet it.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
Just always use the NBA hashtag on Friendster.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
And no, don't do that.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Just get on the space.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Oh, God.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Or email it if you don't use any of that.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Or fax it.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
We don't fax.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
And that's all the housekeeping stuff.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Review this on iTunes.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Subscribe.

40:48.000 --> 40:54.000
And if you want to send in a question, all the methods are on our website, MBMBAM.com.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
Which is about to get a facelift, I think.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Oh, yeah.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Oh, it's beautiful too.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
In the works.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Lots of big things.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Lots of big things.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Stay on board.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
And it's all, make no mistake, it's all because of you.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Because of me?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
No, not you.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
If anything, you're hindering the process, Mr. No T-shirt Buying.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
I bought one today.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Yeah, you're a big one.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Here we go.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
Last question from my brother, Griffin.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
My real brother, Griffin.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I make the distinction because he bought a T-shirt.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I bought one today.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
Oh, and I'm going to be at PAX this week.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
I mentioned it earlier.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
I'm going to be at PAX this week, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
If you are there and you have a My Brother, My Brother, Me T-shirt, wear it.

41:41.000 --> 41:46.000
If you see somebody wearing a My Brother, My Brother, Me T-shirt, hug them because they've earned it.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Unlike some people on this show.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Namely, Travis.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
I found this question on Yahoo Answers Malaysia.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
What's up?

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
National.

41:59.000 --> 42:07.000
Shabana on Yahoo Answers Malaysia asks, also in all caps, by the way,

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
how can you make your own dildo at home?

42:10.000 --> 42:15.000
How am I supposed to break this?

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
I'm Justin McElroy.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
Kiss your dad and square on the lips.

42:24.000 --> 42:51.000
You will never know me.

42:51.000 --> 42:56.000
Give me something I can break.
