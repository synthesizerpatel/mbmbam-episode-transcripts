00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.800
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

00:48.800 --> 00:55.040
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy.

00:55.040 --> 00:59.920
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. Exciting news boys.

00:59.920 --> 01:04.880
Oh god, they're finally doing it. Yeah, they're making a movie about Batman.

01:06.240 --> 01:12.320
I have heard about this. Yeah, so he's like a he's like a cop, right? Do you know?

01:14.320 --> 01:17.920
He wears a silly costume and I can't I can't make heads or tails of this fucking guy.

01:17.920 --> 01:24.560
He's kind of an amateur detective, right? Right. Because he doesn't he's not sanctioned

01:24.560 --> 01:30.560
by anyone. So he kind of is taking the law into his own hands. But here's the thing.

01:30.560 --> 01:36.480
I thought that's what the law was doing already. It's weird. Yeah, it's confused.

01:36.480 --> 01:42.640
It's like confusing. Right. And add on to that, he dresses up as a whimsical character.

01:43.840 --> 01:49.440
I assume for merchandising reasons. That's crass. That's cynical, Travis.

01:49.440 --> 01:53.520
Might just be copyright. I don't know. But they're making a movie about him.

01:53.520 --> 02:02.080
There's a guy asking some questions. Can you give me an example of the questions

02:02.080 --> 02:06.720
you would ask a Batman? Well, he's just kind of like, who are you, Batman?

02:06.720 --> 02:10.480
And he's like, I can't tell you. That's the whole point. That's why I wear the mask.

02:11.200 --> 02:14.080
Hey, it's not fair that you don't that you don't use your real name.

02:15.040 --> 02:20.160
I agree. You know, he's looking for Harvey Dent. He knows Harvey Dent's name.

02:20.160 --> 02:24.800
He knows Harvey Dent's name, but people aren't like, what's your name? And he's never like,

02:24.800 --> 02:27.120
John or whatever his name. I don't know that guy's name.

02:27.120 --> 02:32.400
Yeah. I also, here's the other thing that is weird. And maybe I'm not understanding this.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.080
He doesn't use his real name, I guess, to protect those he loves,

02:36.080 --> 02:38.080
but he also doesn't seem to love anybody.

02:40.720 --> 02:46.240
Then just call yourself John Richards or whatever. I don't know the man's name.

02:46.240 --> 02:50.400
I don't know what he's protecting. Do you think that Batman would have

02:50.400 --> 02:54.080
the same weight if he were like, why won't you reveal your secret identity?

02:54.080 --> 02:57.360
And he actually had to save the straight face to protect my butler.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.960
Yeah, right? I don't want it.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.760
I have a really nice house. Oh, he's wealthy.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.200
I have a nice house and a cool butler, and I don't want either of them to get messed up.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.320
I'm worried that people will throw eggs at my house.

03:09.120 --> 03:15.520
What's he got? He's got like strong bones or like hover jets or-

03:15.520 --> 03:18.560
He's got good brain. Oh.

03:18.560 --> 03:22.320
Yeah, he's got a real good brain and he's got some cash on hand.

03:22.320 --> 03:27.600
He's got a lot of liquid assets. Don't you think criminals would be like

03:28.400 --> 03:35.920
even more intimidated if they knew that even if they beat the Batman up in a fight,

03:35.920 --> 03:39.280
he could still buy their grandma's house and knock it down?

03:39.280 --> 03:42.560
Or at the very least, he probably has access to high-powered lawyers, you know?

03:42.560 --> 03:46.400
Yeah. Oh, the Joker beat up the Batman again,

03:46.400 --> 03:49.520
and now Batman is suing him. Wait a minute, wait a minute.

03:49.520 --> 03:54.640
And he's going to put him in jail for damages, for his negligence.

03:54.640 --> 03:59.040
Now, hold on. You're telling me this guy knows the Joker?

03:59.840 --> 04:04.080
Oh, well- From the movie The Joker with Joaquin Phoenix?

04:04.080 --> 04:08.880
They know each other in passing. They have a certain familiarity with one another.

04:08.880 --> 04:13.360
I wouldn't say they're intimate. I'm reeled in, man.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.600
I'm all in. Now I'm in.

04:15.600 --> 04:21.200
You remember in The Joker, remember a couple times he met the little kid dressed up like a bat?

04:21.200 --> 04:23.120
Yeah. Well, he doesn't grow out of it like

04:23.120 --> 04:26.480
everybody in the movie says he's going to. He just sticks with it.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.720
He sticks with the whole bit. This is a spinoff.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.240
Yes. It's a spinoff of The Joker.

04:30.800 --> 04:35.280
Maybe, I don't know, a spinoff, a sequel? They're going to make a sequel to The Joker,

04:35.280 --> 04:36.560
right? It seems inevitable.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.080
They got to and made a billion dollars.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.400
Can I give you guys a- I'm going to give you guys a pitch.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.400
Okay. Jokers.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.720
Oh, huh.

04:47.600 --> 04:54.160
And so he just makes other ones by biting them. He finds common criminals, bites them,

04:54.800 --> 04:58.240
turns them into Jokers, creates an army of Jokers.

04:58.240 --> 05:02.080
Isn't this one of the games? I think this is a Batman Arkham game.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.080
Still no Batman. No, no, no.

05:04.080 --> 05:07.840
There's no Batman. He just makes more and more Jokers and they get more and more powerful.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.240
Then if they- Let me ask you a question, Justin.

05:10.800 --> 05:15.200
Just to punch it up a little bit and add a little bit of that griffin's zest and spice

05:15.200 --> 05:20.960
to the pilots you're always whipping up, is if those Jokers bite other people,

05:22.080 --> 05:24.160
do they then also become Jokers?

05:24.160 --> 05:28.560
Uh-huh. Yes, you're getting it. That's a little bit you're getting into act three.

05:29.200 --> 05:35.200
I did want to reserve some of this for our pitch meetings, but yes, that is-

05:35.200 --> 05:38.080
We could do like, and we may be touching a live wire right here,

05:38.080 --> 05:41.280
but it could have a little bit of like coronavirus commentary.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.840
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, can we punch up a little?

05:43.840 --> 05:46.320
Can I punch up a little bit? Can I just do a little punch up?

05:46.320 --> 05:49.200
Wait, I just want to stick with this coronavirus. No, no, I'm going with it.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.120
The masks have big smiley faces on them.

05:57.120 --> 06:02.720
Okay, what if the ending is that now he sees the evil he's created

06:02.720 --> 06:06.000
and he turns good to fight the other Jokers?

06:06.000 --> 06:06.640
No, no, no, no.

06:06.640 --> 06:13.120
And okay, so maybe he and Spider-Man team up and they fight carnage together.

06:13.120 --> 06:16.720
Can you stop saying dumb shit? What if the Joker turns into Batman?

06:16.720 --> 06:17.920
Shit, that is good.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.360
The Joker turns into Batman at the end of Jokers and it's like,

06:21.360 --> 06:25.760
this is where I came from. I have to set right what went wrong.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.440
And then Alfred turns into Joker in the past.

06:29.440 --> 06:33.120
That's what's the hardest is Batman's got a steak outfit.

06:33.120 --> 06:38.800
Yeah, but it's a time loop thing and it's a whole thing.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.000
And it turns out Alfred is like, you're selling it.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.680
Turns out Alfred's biting people and turning them into butlers,

06:46.960 --> 06:48.000
which is peculiar.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Hey, can I, hold on, let me just step out of the bit for a second.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.360
Who is Zack Snyder and why should I care so much about this man's cut?

06:55.360 --> 06:58.720
I will admit to not watching any of the DC superhero movies,

06:58.720 --> 07:01.520
since I did see Man of Steel after drinking two mimosas

07:01.520 --> 07:04.720
and promptly fell asleep for one and one half hours in a movie theater.

07:04.720 --> 07:08.160
I fell asleep after drinking too much booze in Man of Steel 2.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.200
It's a fantastic experience, bad film,

07:11.200 --> 07:13.520
and from what I can tell, the rest of them have been quite bad too.

07:13.520 --> 07:20.240
So as I could tell, Zack Snyder is either the writer, director, maker of some of these films,

07:20.240 --> 07:23.680
and people really think he could be a good actor.

07:23.680 --> 07:27.840
People really think he got the shaft on his cut,

07:27.840 --> 07:31.920
which I guess means the edit or there's extra bonus scenes with Superman,

07:31.920 --> 07:33.360
but he's bad, I don't know, man.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.560
I can explain it to you.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.320
Please, but do keep it short.

07:37.280 --> 07:43.200
I feel like a voice box for our audience and I only barely give a shit about this.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.280
I can explain it in like 30 seconds.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.480
You know how everyone walks out of every movie saying,

07:48.480 --> 07:52.080
the problem with that movie was it was too short and that's why it wasn't good.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.280
And I would like that movie more if it was like an hour and 20 minutes longer?

07:56.080 --> 07:56.720
Yeah.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.080
That's the Snyder cut.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.440
It's almost three hours long.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Fuck yeah, baby, that's what I want.

08:02.000 --> 08:02.480
Yes.

08:02.480 --> 08:07.920
And they added in unfinished scenes that they spent 30 million dollars to finish.

08:08.480 --> 08:09.760
Okay, okay.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.080
All right, why didn't they finish on the first go around, Zack?

08:12.080 --> 08:13.600
That seems like you fucked up, pal.

08:13.600 --> 08:18.320
Yeah, the assumption with the Zack Snyder cut, and I can sort of boil it down for you.

08:18.320 --> 08:18.800
Please.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.840
The assumption being made by the fan base of the Snyder cut

08:21.840 --> 08:25.840
is that a man who has not made a good film since 2004's Dawn of the Dead

08:26.400 --> 08:31.280
did actually secretly make a good film and Joss Whedon messed it up.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.240
That Joss Whedon-

08:32.240 --> 08:33.760
Against all odds,

08:33.760 --> 08:39.760
inspirationally, had not managed to make a good film for 15 years, but did do it.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.680
And then it was taken away from him for being too good?

08:43.680 --> 08:46.480
I am by the fucking dollhouse guy.

08:46.480 --> 08:49.520
The point is that Joss Whedon fucked it up real bad.

08:49.520 --> 08:54.960
Fucked up the work of the director of the Legends of the Guardians, the Owls of Ga'Hoole.

08:54.960 --> 08:55.680
Yes.

08:55.680 --> 08:59.920
It's that the visionary behind Sucker Punch would have nailed it,

09:01.120 --> 09:08.160
but instead Joss Whedon, Zack Snyder had to step down because of, I believe, a death in the family.

09:09.440 --> 09:12.560
But then Joss Whedon came in and fucked it up real bad.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.200
Right.

09:13.200 --> 09:18.000
And so then Zack Snyder came back in and re-injected an hour and 20 minutes

09:18.000 --> 09:20.400
about into the movie and now it's great.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.040
Okay, all I needed was that Owls of Ga'Hoole.

09:23.040 --> 09:27.360
That was really the codex that unlocked this entire sort of mystery for me.

09:27.360 --> 09:32.880
So now I'm fully pumped and I've got my digital reservation ready to go on my Roku.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.320
Should we do some questions?

09:34.320 --> 09:34.880
I'd love that.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.320
This is an advice show.

09:36.320 --> 09:36.800
Obviously.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.320
Obviously.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.600
There is a Snyder cut of this episode.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.240
Yeah.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.960
Which is a joke that would have been funnier three months ago.

09:44.960 --> 09:45.360
Indeed.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.360
And not a joke.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.120
My boyfriend's birthday is coming up

09:49.120 --> 09:52.720
and he has previously requested a specific hat from a TV show he likes.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.880
Just say Jane's hat from Firefly.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.720
Just say it.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.120
The problem is we live together because of the global pandemic.

09:59.120 --> 09:59.760
We're always together.

09:59.760 --> 10:03.440
How can I make him a hat without noticing Secret Knitter?

10:03.440 --> 10:04.640
Okay, it is Jane's hat.

10:04.640 --> 10:05.120
Yes, it is.

10:05.120 --> 10:05.760
Absolutely.

10:05.760 --> 10:06.160
100%.

10:07.200 --> 10:13.040
Can you guys think of another notable TV hat?

10:13.040 --> 10:13.520
Knitted.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.400
Especially knit.

10:14.400 --> 10:19.760
Another notable knitted TV hat, except for Castle's beret from Castle.

10:19.760 --> 10:20.800
Well, obviously.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.080
That's obviously out.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.960
There's the NCIS thinking hat.

10:24.960 --> 10:25.360
Yeah, that's true.

10:25.360 --> 10:29.760
And that's the one that they, when they're having a really tough time

10:29.760 --> 10:32.240
with the murder mystery or whatever on NCIS,

10:32.880 --> 10:38.000
then the one, the lady who wears a sort of Gothic aesthetic

10:38.000 --> 10:41.840
goes into the box where they keep the NCIS thinking hat.

10:41.840 --> 10:42.960
And they call it that.

10:42.960 --> 10:45.920
And there's the one that Lucifer wears in Lucifer.

10:45.920 --> 10:49.360
And it's like a knitted Viking helmet that he puts on every time he has sex.

10:50.960 --> 10:54.320
And he calls it my sexy time Viking hat, which isn't good.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.760
It's not a good, but it's like three times an episode it comes up.

10:57.760 --> 10:58.560
He's, okay.

10:58.560 --> 11:01.920
Now, Joe Mantegna in the hit series, Criminal Minds,

11:02.480 --> 11:05.520
every once in a while he says, bring me the Criminal Mind hat.

11:05.520 --> 11:07.520
And that's how he gets into the criminal's head.

11:07.520 --> 11:12.000
It's a sort of a, how would you, it looks like kind of a beer,

11:12.000 --> 11:16.080
one of the beer drinking hats, but it's completely knitted.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.600
So that could be the hat they're dealing with.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.720
And you know how in The Good Doctor he asked for his hat,

11:20.720 --> 11:25.280
but it's just kind of like a mask that makes him look like the anonymous guy,

11:25.280 --> 11:27.520
makes him look like Guy Fawkes, but it's knitted.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.120
Yeah, that show got really hacker-y.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.240
Yeah, it turned really hacker-y.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.080
It's a big focus on hackers.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.040
Yeah, it was weird.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.760
Well, there's the Justice hat from Knight Court.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.760
Of course, of course.

11:39.760 --> 11:42.880
How can you knit in private a secret knitting?

11:42.880 --> 11:44.080
Wow, you really couldn't have picked-

11:44.080 --> 11:44.880
On the turlet.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.680
On the turlet, that's high stakes, isn't it?

11:47.680 --> 11:48.480
Knitting is a very-

11:48.480 --> 11:50.320
You're gonna have to, yeah.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.200
The problem with this is, if you haven't-

11:53.200 --> 11:53.920
What happened?

11:53.920 --> 11:55.440
What the fuck just happened to you?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.320
Well, I was thinking about knitting on the turlet,

11:58.320 --> 12:00.480
and then I thought, flipped your microphone upside down.

12:00.480 --> 12:04.240
Yeah, then I thought, what happens if your boyfriend knows

12:04.240 --> 12:08.000
that you're kind of a fast bathroom-er, right?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.320
And now you're in there for like 20 minutes at a time?

12:10.320 --> 12:13.280
You're gonna have to develop a condition.

12:13.280 --> 12:19.120
Whoa, sorry, NBC just referenced our meme.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.160
That's so strange.

12:20.160 --> 12:20.800
What?

12:20.800 --> 12:22.800
The NBC Twitter account just tweeted,

12:22.800 --> 12:24.400
we are very uncomfortable with the energy

12:24.400 --> 12:25.840
we've created in the studio today,

12:25.840 --> 12:30.720
which is a TikTok meme from the My Bim Bam TV show.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.520
That's so weird.

12:31.520 --> 12:32.000
Whoa.

12:32.000 --> 12:32.400
Fucking-

12:32.400 --> 12:32.880
Sorry, that-

12:32.880 --> 12:35.200
Sorry, everybody, that really derailed us, but like-

12:35.200 --> 12:36.480
Well, let's talk about that.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.240
Well, let's talk about this.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.120
Let's speak on this.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.440
The other thing we were doing wasn't interesting.

12:41.440 --> 12:42.480
Let's speak on this, NBC.

12:42.480 --> 12:43.840
Let's speak on it, yeah.

12:43.840 --> 12:46.240
Hey, so we've interrupted the knitting question.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.040
Do it on the toilet.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.160
Travis got it in one.

12:48.160 --> 12:52.480
NBC has just tweeted, we are very comfortable

12:52.480 --> 12:55.520
with the energy we've created in the studio today.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.600
And then a link to a video about office.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.640
Right, so they take it and they've turned it.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.680
They're comfortable.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.160
What is it?

13:02.160 --> 13:05.120
This is a TikTok meme from the hit series.

13:05.120 --> 13:09.840
Now, okay, here's the weird fucking Ouroboros

13:09.840 --> 13:12.320
that I do not even know that NBC knows

13:12.320 --> 13:13.920
that they have bit into.

13:14.640 --> 13:18.240
They have referenced a TikTok based on a TV show.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.200
That they unknowingly accidentally made.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.120
That they secretly own-

13:25.120 --> 13:27.200
They own that meme.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.440
Oh, that's good shit.

13:31.440 --> 13:36.240
And they have once again bit into the McElroy apple

13:36.240 --> 13:40.880
with the work we are doing with them

13:40.880 --> 13:44.560
on a Taz animated series on Peacock,

13:44.560 --> 13:47.440
which is definitely coloring every word

13:47.440 --> 13:50.160
of what I've been saying for the past couple of minutes.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.080
And that's why I'm a big fan of this.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.360
A big fan of this.

13:53.360 --> 13:58.880
I love to see that NBC is kind of one

13:58.880 --> 14:01.600
of the weirdest relationships in entertainment,

14:01.600 --> 14:03.520
I think, us and the NBC brand.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.200
Wouldn't you say that that is true?

14:05.200 --> 14:08.560
Yes, but good in a weird way.

14:08.560 --> 14:12.240
When NBC picked up Brooklyn Nine-Nine

14:12.240 --> 14:14.080
because they were like, Mike sure belongs here.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.520
This is Mike sure's home.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.040
That's kind of like us,

14:17.040 --> 14:19.440
but it's like they keep finding us in the attic

14:19.440 --> 14:21.600
and they're like, I guess this is the McElroy's home.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.320
Did we not get rid of the McElroy?

14:24.320 --> 14:24.960
I thought we got-

14:24.960 --> 14:25.680
No, they're still?

14:25.680 --> 14:27.040
Okay, cool, great, great, great.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.240
Yeah, we are.

14:28.240 --> 14:31.680
We're the salamander under the couch.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.080
You thought you saw it run out the front,

14:34.080 --> 14:36.240
but was actually in the vent the whole time.

14:36.240 --> 14:36.740
Yeah.

14:37.440 --> 14:38.000
They're back.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.920
Let's try to make a cartoon of them, I guess.

14:39.920 --> 14:40.420
Yes.

14:41.760 --> 14:48.880
Can you knit together the hat in small quadrants?

14:49.600 --> 14:52.800
Like you knit a sixteenth of the hat

14:52.800 --> 14:54.080
and he's like, what is that?

14:54.080 --> 14:56.080
And you say a coaster, right?

14:56.080 --> 14:57.120
Mm-hmm.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.920
And then you can knit those 16 pieces together

14:59.920 --> 15:00.800
to make the hat.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.240
And then you can kind of divide up the work

15:02.240 --> 15:03.840
and it's never completely obvious

15:03.840 --> 15:04.880
what it is that you're making.

15:05.520 --> 15:05.920
Oh, but that takes so much-

15:05.920 --> 15:07.200
And also during the interim,

15:07.760 --> 15:09.600
in the interim, you have so many coasters.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.440
But then you got to really line that up.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.800
That's going to take a lot of precision

15:12.800 --> 15:15.120
because if you do it in like 16 pieces

15:15.120 --> 15:18.000
and even the scale is slightly off on some of them,

15:18.560 --> 15:21.280
oh boy, it's going to look silly.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.280
You got to do it all sort of separate.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.480
Oh, you know what you could do?

15:26.480 --> 15:30.560
You know how sometimes businesses will ship

15:31.280 --> 15:34.720
things separately from internationally

15:34.720 --> 15:36.880
to try to skirt tariffs?

15:36.880 --> 15:37.120
Yeah.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.320
They do like tariff engineering

15:38.320 --> 15:41.280
by dismantling something into separate components.

15:41.280 --> 15:41.520
We all know that.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.080
And importing those before they're assembled.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.560
That's basically what you could do with this hat.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.400
Just leave different sections of it

15:48.960 --> 15:50.000
lying around the house.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.800
And oh, that was just like a scrap project I did.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.640
And then one furious night,

15:54.640 --> 15:58.320
you assemble all of the pre-knitted pieces.

15:58.320 --> 16:03.040
I also, for the record, do not know how knitting works.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.680
I should have established that earlier.

16:05.680 --> 16:10.560
Fish like candy to my soul.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.120
Didn't we just do it?

16:11.120 --> 16:14.320
Fish you rock and fish you roll.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.520
It feels like we just did it.

16:15.520 --> 16:19.120
Lost for you and I'm so lost for fish.

16:19.680 --> 16:20.240
David.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.600
And you come fish into me.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.480
Did you change the name of the segment, David?

16:26.480 --> 16:28.320
And I fish into you.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.800
We fucking get it, Dave Matthews, man.

16:30.800 --> 16:31.520
Let's start the quiz.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.440
Hi, it's me, your host,

16:33.440 --> 16:35.360
the host of Under the Table in Fishing,

16:35.360 --> 16:37.440
America's number one game show

16:37.440 --> 16:39.760
about Dave Matthews Band and fish.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.520
Sorry, right now, are you Travis or Dave Matthews?

16:41.520 --> 16:42.640
No, I'm Travis now.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.480
You can tell because I sound like Travis.

16:44.480 --> 16:45.840
And I'm Dave Matthews.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.520
I'm the co-host.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.680
Oh, thank you for having me again.

16:49.680 --> 16:53.760
This is my court ordered community service.

16:53.760 --> 16:56.720
No, okay, Foghorn Leghorn Matthews.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.440
Where am I from?

16:58.000 --> 16:58.800
Nobody knows.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.560
Under the Table and Fryin'.

17:00.560 --> 17:01.600
Ah, very good.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.520
Travis, do you want to tell them about the twist this week?

17:05.520 --> 17:06.480
Yes, thank you, Dave.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.200
In this week's Under the Table in Fishing,

17:09.840 --> 17:12.080
as always, I will be reading you lyrics

17:12.080 --> 17:14.480
from Dave Matthews Band and fish.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.120
And you'll be trying to guess who did what.

17:17.120 --> 17:20.080
But this week, there will also be one lyric

17:20.080 --> 17:22.240
by the band 311 thrown in there.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.040
You stinker.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.280
And you'll have to identify that.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.880
I don't want to make it too easy for you

17:26.880 --> 17:27.840
or the folks at home.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.040
Let's go.

17:29.040 --> 17:32.000
Okay, don't let it get away.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.720
And if we did, we're gonna get it back.

17:34.720 --> 17:39.200
And in time, you and me, we will, we will, we will,

17:39.200 --> 17:42.160
we will be over and again and again.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.400
Ah, Jesus Christ.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.480
Fish, I'm gonna say fish.

17:47.520 --> 17:52.240
I'm gonna, this will be a wild move on your part,

17:52.240 --> 17:54.720
but I'm gonna start out guessing 311.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.280
No, I'm sorry, that is Dave Matthews Band.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.960
How did we both fuck that up?

17:58.960 --> 18:01.280
The Dave Matthews Experience.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.640
Okay, next, coconuts and chloroform,

18:04.640 --> 18:07.520
some liquor and some cork, toxic waste,

18:07.520 --> 18:10.800
some purple paste, she hopes was not explosive.

18:10.800 --> 18:11.200
Fish.

18:11.200 --> 18:11.840
Fish.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.440
That is fish, that is reba.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.880
Yeah, by fish.

18:14.880 --> 18:18.240
I need to start identifying something as fish or not fish.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.880
I think it's the introduction of Dave Matthews Band

18:20.880 --> 18:22.560
that is messing me up in my head

18:22.560 --> 18:24.880
because the fish ones are pretty obvious.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.560
I need to just start there and work backwards.

18:26.560 --> 18:32.160
Okay, you're there, I'm here, let's dance, my dear.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.440
What's your name?

18:33.440 --> 18:34.160
How do you do?

18:34.720 --> 18:35.840
What's the game?

18:35.840 --> 18:37.040
Hallelujah.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.640
Dave Matthews Band?

18:38.640 --> 18:39.680
I'm gonna say 311.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.520
That is Dave Matthews Band.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.320
Nice job, Griffin.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.160
That girl is you.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.160
Yes, this is Dave Matthews again.

18:46.160 --> 18:49.680
What I realized helping Travis put together this quiz,

18:50.480 --> 18:51.920
my lyrics are dumb.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.200
Now, don't say, Dave could be listening.

18:55.200 --> 18:55.920
Dave could be listening.

18:55.920 --> 18:56.480
I'm right here.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.480
A lot of people like Dave Matthews Band.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.680
You're fuckin' self-included.

19:02.240 --> 19:02.640
Okay.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.880
Tell me you've never looked at ants differently.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.680
I do, man, don't get me wrong.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.200
I guess they are marching.

19:09.200 --> 19:12.240
Folks at home, I love Dave Matthews Band.

19:12.240 --> 19:17.040
I don't, but every time I do get indigestion,

19:17.040 --> 19:19.920
Rachel does get very annoyed that I instantly just go,

19:19.920 --> 19:25.040
I eat too much, just to let her know I have eaten too much.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.760
Don't you rob yourself of what you're feeling.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.720
Don't you rob yourself of all that you could be.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.680
Roll hard till midnight, roll till it's light.

19:35.120 --> 19:35.520
Fish.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.000
Now hold on, that's interesting.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.600
Is that one 311?

19:40.160 --> 19:42.000
No, that one is Dave Matthews Band.

19:42.000 --> 19:42.800
Shut the fuck up.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.080
They're so right.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.840
This is so hard.

19:45.840 --> 19:46.960
Griffin is one up.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.640
Griffin is one up.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.080
Where is the Joker?

19:50.080 --> 19:53.440
Have you seen him around with his three-coned crap?

19:54.080 --> 20:00.400
Excuse me, his three-coned cap that he wears like a clown?

20:01.120 --> 20:01.600
Batman.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.880
Well, that's not one of the options, Justin.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.520
Weirdly, am I saying Batman?

20:07.520 --> 20:07.760
No.

20:10.800 --> 20:11.600
Fish.

20:11.600 --> 20:16.000
God, it feels like fish, but I think it's one of those trick fish.

20:18.560 --> 20:23.680
This is 311 writing in the mode of fish as a pastiche.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.040
In their fish period.

20:25.040 --> 20:25.760
Two fish.

20:25.760 --> 20:26.720
It is fish.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.280
Two up for Griffin.

20:29.920 --> 20:33.040
Or it could be 311 writing so well.

20:33.040 --> 20:33.840
It could be fair.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.920
I don't know who wrote these songs for fish.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.240
It's possible 311 wrote it for fish.

20:38.240 --> 20:38.480
Right.

20:38.480 --> 20:42.160
This is our cover of the 311 song.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.080
We are the band Fish.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.440
Let us begin our concert.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.800
Sweetly, in every way that you treat me.

20:48.800 --> 20:52.240
A fish story, but you know that it's picture perfect.

20:52.240 --> 20:55.040
Our morning glory every time that we wake.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.440
The morning ride is the longest ride.

20:58.000 --> 20:58.480
Take it.

20:59.760 --> 21:06.240
Now, you said the word fish in there to try and catch us up, didn't you?

21:07.040 --> 21:07.600
I can't answer that.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.800
I don't.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.840
Fish has written some truly rough lyrics in the past.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.840
I do not think that they would do that.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.640
I also didn't get a Dave vibe from that.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.800
So I'm going to actually I'm going to put 311.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.680
I'm going to put 311.

21:19.680 --> 21:20.880
That is 311.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.000
Yes.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.200
That is no 311.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.600
We got 311 in the fucking dragnet.

21:25.600 --> 21:30.400
Okay, I'm building you a pyramid with limestone blocks so large.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.240
I drag them from the mountaintop.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.400
You'll need a two car garage.

21:34.400 --> 21:37.760
That feels Dave Matthew.

21:37.760 --> 21:38.080
Fuck.

21:38.960 --> 21:39.280
Fuck.

21:39.280 --> 21:40.080
Can you read it again?

21:40.080 --> 21:41.200
That's really hard.

21:41.200 --> 21:41.440
Yes.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.080
I'm building you a pyramid with limestone blocks so large.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.000
I drag them from the mountaintop.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.080
You'll need a two car garage.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.840
See, that doesn't feel like Dave to me.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.840
And there's no more 311, right?

21:53.840 --> 21:55.040
You can give me that guarantee.

21:55.040 --> 21:55.760
That's fish then.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.440
I agree with Griff.

21:57.440 --> 21:58.720
That is fish.

21:58.720 --> 21:59.520
Okay, one more.

21:59.520 --> 22:00.000
One more.

22:00.000 --> 22:00.800
Yes.

22:00.800 --> 22:01.040
Okay.

22:01.040 --> 22:04.880
Oh, hold tight, because the road can be a crazy ride.

22:05.440 --> 22:09.600
And I know we're going to be all right, because you are here with me.

22:11.120 --> 22:11.600
Dave.

22:12.160 --> 22:12.640
Dave.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.080
That is Dave Matthews.

22:14.720 --> 22:15.680
Well done, boys.

22:16.240 --> 22:17.040
Well done.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.280
I feel really weird about how good I did.

22:19.280 --> 22:19.680
Yeah.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.920
Yeah, I think you won the last time too, Griffin.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.920
Yeah, he won the last time.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.280
Well.

22:25.280 --> 22:29.760
I like this bit, because I've finally found something I'm good at.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.560
Why are you so good at Under the Table and Fishing?

22:32.560 --> 22:33.120
I don't know.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.800
I don't really like any of the bands involved.

22:34.800 --> 22:35.840
Can I do a Yahoo?

22:35.840 --> 22:36.320
Yes.

22:36.320 --> 22:36.800
I'd love that.

22:36.800 --> 22:37.040
Thank you.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.080
This one was sent in by Aaron.

22:38.080 --> 22:38.640
Thank you, Aaron.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.960
It's anonymous Yahoo Answers user, who I'm going to call.

22:42.080 --> 22:47.040
Well, somebody responded to it, and their name is Deadpool, which is fucking cool and funny.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.320
So Deadpool asks.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.160
I'm going to kick Deadpool's ass.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.280
Do you remember that?

22:51.280 --> 22:54.960
One time we were at a hotel, and there was a conference going on, and someone was like

22:54.960 --> 22:58.880
on like the 10th floor looking out the window, and they saw someone cosplaying as Deadpool,

22:58.880 --> 23:03.040
and just said, half to themselves, I'm going to kick Deadpool's ass.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.360
Yeah, it was at Comic-Con, and there were so many people there, and it's like,

23:07.360 --> 23:08.640
we're on the 10th floor of the hotel.

23:08.640 --> 23:11.360
How are you going to get down there and find that Deadpool again?

23:11.360 --> 23:12.560
And why?

23:12.560 --> 23:14.160
That specific Deadpool.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.000
There's other Deadpools at Comic-Con.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.320
There's 50,000 fucking Deadpools here.

23:18.320 --> 23:19.200
How are you going to find that?

23:19.200 --> 23:21.200
What did that one Deadpool do to you?

23:21.200 --> 23:24.960
Is that the real Deadpool and your Deadpool's enemy?

23:24.960 --> 23:25.680
Whose name I don't know.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.160
Anyway, where's the Deadpool?

23:28.160 --> 23:29.520
The Zack Snyder Deadpool cut?

23:30.720 --> 23:31.760
Uh, Deadpool asks.

23:31.760 --> 23:35.760
Just when I thought cowboy culture was dead, it only seems to be growing.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.280
Agree slash disagree.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.960
Growing up, my friends were ashamed of their cowboy parents.

23:40.960 --> 23:48.640
Hey son, you want me to come in to career day?

23:48.640 --> 23:49.440
No, dad.

23:49.440 --> 23:50.480
No, please.

23:51.040 --> 23:53.040
I can do some of my lasso tricks.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.640
No, mom's shit.

23:54.640 --> 23:55.760
Come on.

23:57.120 --> 24:00.640
Now, growing up, my friends were ashamed of their cowboy parents.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.520
They refused to dress cowboy-ish and made comments like,

24:03.520 --> 24:04.720
I hate country music.

24:04.720 --> 24:07.920
But now they are older, most of them with families.

24:07.920 --> 24:12.160
I noticed now they changed and have accepted the cowboy lifestyle.

24:12.160 --> 24:15.600
They now dress in cowboy clothes and listen to country music.

24:15.600 --> 24:16.800
Have you noticed this?

24:16.800 --> 24:19.920
Or is this just something that happened in my city?

24:20.560 --> 24:21.200
That's from Deadpool.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.960
No, it's definitely all over.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.080
I've seen that all over.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.680
You get these punk kids.

24:25.680 --> 24:30.560
Yeah, when they're 18, they're getting tatted up and pierced all over.

24:30.560 --> 24:34.240
But then by 36, it's bolo ties, baby.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.160
They're wearing Stetsons.

24:39.920 --> 24:43.120
They're wearing some dance boots.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.400
Getting close with the Lord.

24:46.400 --> 24:49.760
Getting close with the Lord and enjoying country music.

24:49.760 --> 24:51.600
Little Carrie Underwood.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.480
I bet they enjoy.

24:52.480 --> 24:56.640
And they do not like it when you take their cows.

24:56.640 --> 24:59.440
And they're like, I burned that cow's skin.

24:59.440 --> 25:02.720
I put a hot piece of metal on that cow.

25:03.840 --> 25:07.760
It's mine, but I see it on your lawn, Dave.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.840
And you're like, well, it wandered over here.

25:09.840 --> 25:12.400
Me and my family's gonna eat that cow later.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.440
And you took him.

25:13.440 --> 25:16.640
So now I have to get you.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.960
And now do you want some of these beings in the meantime

25:20.960 --> 25:24.000
that I've been cooking over this open fire?

25:24.000 --> 25:24.880
That's huge now.

25:24.880 --> 25:25.520
Holy shit.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.840
Like, let's put jokes away for a second.

25:27.840 --> 25:30.000
Teens are cooking beans on campfires.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.120
Yeah, right?

25:31.120 --> 25:32.000
Teens on beans.

25:32.000 --> 25:32.960
They're called teen beans.

25:33.680 --> 25:40.320
And they're full of protein and actually really good on the glycemic index.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.520
So that I love.

25:41.520 --> 25:47.600
I saw on Facebook, though, that it was leading to a lot of injuries and kids.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.400
So fucked it.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.440
I think it fucking sucks that, like, beans come up organically.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.520
And you know what a big part beans play in my life.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.160
And I've probably got a lot of good bean material saved up.

25:56.160 --> 25:59.280
And the fact that you would just trample me like that is extremely hurtful.

25:59.280 --> 26:00.480
He's the beans man.

26:00.480 --> 26:01.440
He's the beans man, Travis.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.960
I'm sorry I trampled your beans.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.560
I just have so many great insights about beans.

26:06.560 --> 26:06.800
Yeah.

26:06.800 --> 26:07.040
Yeah.

26:07.680 --> 26:10.240
Okay, see, I was taking it like a Tide Pod way.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.480
It's like eating a thousand tiny loaves of bread.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.000
Really?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.240
See, Travis, let's just sit in it for a second

26:16.240 --> 26:17.280
and let Justin sort of dump his beans wisdom.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.800
I'd love to sit in some beans.

26:18.800 --> 26:23.520
Remember that time I told Patch Adams my dream was to sit in a swimming pool full of beans?

26:23.520 --> 26:24.080
Yeah.

26:24.080 --> 26:25.200
Why did you do that?

26:25.840 --> 26:26.800
Because I'm nasty.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.840
You asked us if you should do that.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.840
And we said, no, you know what's going to happen.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.680
He's going to make you sit in beans.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.920
And then you're going to get in and you're going to instantly realize,

26:35.920 --> 26:37.040
oh, I don't like this.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.880
And he's going to make you stay in it till you're better.

26:38.880 --> 26:42.640
I know for 100% fact two things.

26:42.640 --> 26:47.440
One, our audience has never seen the film Patch Adams.

26:47.440 --> 26:52.160
Two, we have definitely talked about the scene at Patch Adams

26:52.160 --> 26:57.200
where he allows an old woman her life's goal of sitting in a vat full of noodles.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.400
This is true.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.680
These two things.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.360
And I know a third thing.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.880
I have a new joke about it.

27:02.880 --> 27:03.200
Okay.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.960
How long did that old lady?

27:05.760 --> 27:08.480
Do you think after five minutes she was like,

27:08.480 --> 27:11.600
I know this probably took a long time to engineer,

27:11.600 --> 27:16.000
but I'd like very much to get out of the noodles now if that would be okay.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.160
I think if she made it five minutes,

27:18.160 --> 27:21.040
that's the triumph of the human spirit.

27:21.040 --> 27:24.800
Because I would get in and be like, there's not a lot to do now.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.160
Okay.

27:26.160 --> 27:29.440
And now what do I do?

27:29.440 --> 27:29.680
Yeah.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.120
What's next for me?

27:31.120 --> 27:37.280
One time I went into like a resale shop to look for furniture for the theater I was working at.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.680
And they had a bunch of TV set up for sale.

27:39.680 --> 27:42.000
And like you do at like a lot of electronic stores,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.080
they had like a movie playing on it.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.320
And the movie they were playing on it was Patch Adams.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.000
And it was such an interesting choice to me because they were like,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.640
you know, it's going to get people really hyped to buy these TVs.

27:52.640 --> 27:55.600
It's going to really show the top quality of these TVs

27:55.600 --> 27:58.960
and get people energized Patch Adams.

27:59.840 --> 28:04.320
And so there was just a row of 20 televisions all showing Patch Adams.

28:04.320 --> 28:07.360
One time I was in the waiting room while my oil was getting changed

28:07.360 --> 28:10.160
and they were showing Hancock.

28:10.160 --> 28:10.560
Nice.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.800
There's not anything else I have to say about that.

28:12.800 --> 28:14.160
It's a badass flick.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.200
I enjoyed it.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.000
Superheroes.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.440
But he's not good.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.480
He's not nice.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.240
We've also talked about Hancock before.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.840
So let's maybe-

28:21.840 --> 28:23.600
We've talked about everything before though.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.080
We can't just stop.

28:24.080 --> 28:25.360
I haven't talked about cowboy culture.

28:25.360 --> 28:30.320
And I knew, listen, I wasn't ashamed of our cowboy parents.

28:30.320 --> 28:36.400
I thought they were putting in honest work to raise their family.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.080
You know what I appreciated?

28:39.680 --> 28:41.440
Dad's best friend was his horse.

28:41.440 --> 28:44.880
And people have asked us time and time again,

28:44.880 --> 28:46.640
what's the deal with you guys and horses?

28:46.640 --> 28:47.520
And that's really it.

28:48.640 --> 28:52.640
There was Uncle Honey and he was around all the time.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.000
And we loved that guy.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.400
And sometimes Dad let him babysit or take the car out when he had big plans.

28:59.360 --> 29:00.080
The horse?

29:00.080 --> 29:00.580
Yeah.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.560
We knew growing up, and this was fine with us,

29:04.560 --> 29:09.280
we knew that if you asked our dad to list his great loves of his life,

29:09.280 --> 29:12.880
we would be three, mom would be two,

29:12.880 --> 29:16.000
the open prairie at dawn would be number one.

29:16.000 --> 29:16.500
Absolutely.

29:16.500 --> 29:17.360
That's our dad's heart.

29:17.360 --> 29:20.800
Our dad's heart is in that wide open trail.

29:21.360 --> 29:27.040
And the promise of fortune and misfortune that is imbued within.

29:27.040 --> 29:30.880
And do you guys remember when Dad retired from being a sheriff

29:30.880 --> 29:35.280
and moved to that town because he wanted to make some money,

29:35.280 --> 29:36.720
not in the gold trade,

29:36.720 --> 29:39.200
but rather selling equipment to people in the gold trade.

29:39.200 --> 29:44.560
But the town was so lawless that he was forced to take up the badge again

29:44.560 --> 29:46.000
and become the law in that town.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.280
And I respected that.

29:47.920 --> 29:48.720
Yeah, I did.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.400
I understood it too, for sure.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.960
Fucking hated Bad Moustache Man, though.

29:52.960 --> 29:57.760
You remember when Dad had to fight Bad Moustache Man to keep his city safe?

29:57.760 --> 30:02.240
He made six cool friends and they were magnificent.

30:02.240 --> 30:05.440
And I've run out of cowboy references.

30:05.440 --> 30:06.160
I did, yeah.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.360
Do you remember when Dad played for the Dallas Cowboys?

30:11.040 --> 30:13.680
But then he broke his shoulder, had to retire.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.240
Remember when our dad played Cowboy Curtis?

30:16.240 --> 30:16.480
Yeah.

30:16.480 --> 30:29.840
Yeah, do you remember when our dad was a young male cow?

30:37.840 --> 30:38.080
Yeah.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.120
Gosh, okay.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.120
So what do we want to do?

30:43.120 --> 30:44.640
You guys want to do another question?

30:44.640 --> 30:45.680
You want to go to the money?

30:45.680 --> 30:46.720
What are y'all feeling right now?

30:46.720 --> 30:50.000
That was such a good MoneyZone handoff, and you've botched it.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.080
You have dropped the ball, just like our dad did in Super Bowl XXXVI.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.520
Okay, okay.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.840
Remember when our dad got really good at Bebop?

31:13.840 --> 31:16.480
Okay, all right, listen.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.000
No, shut up.

31:19.120 --> 31:19.600
Shut up.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.160
Our dad works at a drugstore now.

31:22.160 --> 31:23.840
It's a very different lifestyle.

31:25.120 --> 31:28.880
Okay, now we are going to go there, the MoneyZone.

31:39.520 --> 31:43.040
It's more important than ever to use the postal service.

31:43.040 --> 31:44.480
There, I said it.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.920

Once your mail is ready, just leave it for your mail carrier,

32:17.280 --> 32:18.560
maybe with a little note that says,

32:18.560 --> 32:20.480
thank you so much, we couldn't do this without you.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.720

Just go to Stamps.com,

32:43.200 --> 32:45.040
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage,

32:45.040 --> 32:47.360
and type in my brother, all one word.

32:47.360 --> 32:50.560
That's Stamps.com, enter my brother, all one word.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.280
You gotta brush the teeth.

32:53.280 --> 32:53.780
Yep.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.400
They get dirty when you eat food.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.800
And that's unavoidable.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.840
There's no way, there's no such thing as clean food.

33:02.800 --> 33:03.840
It's all gonna get on there.

33:03.840 --> 33:07.040
It's all gonna stain them and get them filthy, filthy.

33:07.040 --> 33:09.120
And it's not just, it's not just when you eat food,

33:09.120 --> 33:13.680
sometimes you're on a motorbike and you just have your mouth open.

33:13.680 --> 33:15.040
You get bugs in there.

33:15.040 --> 33:20.240
Or you trip while you're on a farm and you land on a big puddle of hog shit.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.960
Whatever the situation,

33:22.960 --> 33:26.080
Quip has this amazing smart electric toothbrush

33:26.080 --> 33:31.440
that can teach you good habits like brushing your teeth correctly

33:31.440 --> 33:32.880
for the right amount of time.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.080
And for the right reasons.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.320
For the correct reasons.

33:36.320 --> 33:38.560
I'm just sick of all these sellouts out there

33:38.560 --> 33:42.720
brushing their teeth just to get ads on their shows.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.360
I brush my teeth for the right reasons, Quip.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.480
Well, Quip has another good reason for you to do it.

33:48.480 --> 33:51.520
They have this new smart brush for adults and kids,

33:51.520 --> 33:55.200
and it connects to this Quip app on your fricking phone.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.160
And it measures how good a brusher you are,

33:59.360 --> 34:04.320
and you get points, and you can redeem those points for rewards,

34:04.320 --> 34:08.800
like free products, gift cards, and discounts from Quip and partners.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.880
I'm sorry, that's the right reason.

34:10.880 --> 34:11.840
I'm gonna do that now.

34:12.960 --> 34:13.840
I've changed my mind.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.120
This is the right reason.

34:15.120 --> 34:20.080
It's a very strong, it's a powerful idea from Quip.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.680
Innovators in the space.

34:21.680 --> 34:22.240
Fuck yes.

34:22.240 --> 34:24.400
Feel like you're going to Chuck E. Cheese every time you brush your teeth.

34:25.040 --> 34:25.840
It's amazing.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.840
You can get a brush, you can get a brush head,

34:27.840 --> 34:31.040
toothpaste, and floss refills delivered from five bucks,

34:31.040 --> 34:33.520
and you can start getting rewarded for brushing your teeth today

34:33.520 --> 34:36.320

That's G-E-T-Q-U-I-P.com slash my brother.

34:44.800 --> 34:45.280
Quip.

34:45.280 --> 34:49.360
Better oral health made simple and rewarding.

34:49.920 --> 34:50.960
Shmanners.

34:50.960 --> 34:51.760
Noun.

34:51.760 --> 34:52.400
Definition.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.840
Rules of etiquette designed not to judge others,

34:55.840 --> 34:59.520
but rather to guide ourselves through everyday social situations.

34:59.520 --> 35:00.240
Hello, internet.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.000
I'm your husband, host Travis McElroy.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.320
And I'm your wife, host Teresa McElroy.

35:04.320 --> 35:06.480
Every week on Shmanners, we take a look at a topic

35:06.480 --> 35:08.880
that has to do with society or manners.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.720
We talk about the history of it.

35:10.720 --> 35:13.520
We take a look at how it applies to everyday life.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.520
And we take some of your questions.

35:15.520 --> 35:18.800
And sometimes we do a biography about a really cool person

35:18.800 --> 35:21.600
that had an impact on how we view etiquette.

35:21.600 --> 35:25.760
So join us every Friday and listen to Shmanners on maximumfun.org

35:25.760 --> 35:28.160
or wherever podcasts are found.

35:28.160 --> 35:32.640
Manners shmanners, get it?

35:32.640 --> 35:34.320
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

35:34.320 --> 35:34.800
Munch.

35:35.840 --> 35:38.400
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.200
Oh.

35:39.200 --> 35:39.920
Oh, no.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.720
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

35:42.720 --> 35:44.160
I wanna munch.

35:44.160 --> 35:44.880
Squad?

35:44.880 --> 35:45.600
Squad?

35:45.600 --> 35:46.640
Welcome to Munch Squad.

35:46.640 --> 35:49.360
It's a somber podcast within a podcast dedicated

35:49.360 --> 35:51.120
to the latest and greatest in brand eating.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.840
And today we're saying goodbye to some friends.

35:54.480 --> 35:57.360
I have three different stories for you all about saying goodbye.

35:57.360 --> 35:57.760
Oh, no.

35:57.760 --> 36:00.960
And I think in these times it's important to embrace change,

36:00.960 --> 36:04.240
but it's also very important to take a look back and say,

36:04.240 --> 36:06.240
this is where we were, this is who we were,

36:06.240 --> 36:07.040
this is what we were.

36:08.320 --> 36:11.040
The first and most notable, and this one is gonna be

36:11.040 --> 36:12.240
kind of a harder Munch Squad,

36:12.240 --> 36:13.840
because it's not a lot of jokes in this one.

36:13.840 --> 36:14.880
We're gonna send jokes.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.280
Jokes can kind of press the air up against the door

36:17.280 --> 36:18.800
in case it hears something really important,

36:18.800 --> 36:21.360
but for the most part, I just wanna take a moment

36:21.360 --> 36:23.920
to say goodbye, because on August 13th,

36:23.920 --> 36:27.600
Taco Bell trimmed their menu at stores across the country.

36:27.600 --> 36:32.640
And we said goodbye to 12 really great items, Trav.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.040
Can I make one joke?

36:36.640 --> 36:37.360
Well, let's see.

36:38.400 --> 36:41.200
It's weird to me that Taco Bell would have to cut their items

36:41.200 --> 36:44.320
when they are all made from the same five basic ingredients.

36:45.120 --> 36:45.920
That's cruel.

36:49.920 --> 36:50.800
I heard you out though.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.240
So they're streamlining as a result of COVID-19.

36:54.240 --> 36:57.680
I mean, today's calamities and casualties

36:57.680 --> 36:59.920
are all COVID-19 related.

36:59.920 --> 37:01.040
So they're streamlining their menu.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.160
A lot of restaurants have done this.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.760
You can't get a fucking grilled chicken sandwich

37:03.760 --> 37:05.680
at McDonald's to save your life,

37:05.680 --> 37:07.760
even if you're the kind of boy that just eats

37:07.760 --> 37:10.560
the loose breast of chicken to get him through the day.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.080
It's not available to you anymore.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.080
Taco Bell is following suit.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.520
We're gonna say goodbye to some friends

37:15.520 --> 37:18.000
in the grilled steak soft taco.

37:18.000 --> 37:18.500
No!

37:19.200 --> 37:20.880
The seven layer burrito.

37:20.880 --> 37:21.380
What?

37:21.920 --> 37:22.880
The quesarito.

37:22.880 --> 37:26.640
The quesarito, which is weirdly still available

37:26.640 --> 37:29.280
via the app for order ahead.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.560
So I guess it's kind of like,

37:30.560 --> 37:32.880
if you want a quesaría, you've got to let us know.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.840
We gotta go into the closet.

37:35.840 --> 37:36.800
We got a high shelf.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.160
We gotta get some stuff off of.

37:39.520 --> 37:40.640
Nacho Supreme.

37:40.640 --> 37:41.140
Whoa!

37:41.760 --> 37:42.800
This is the category.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.400
This is where it really starts to hurt for me

37:44.400 --> 37:51.040
because the beefy Fritos burrito is like my fucking shit,

37:51.040 --> 37:52.560
along with the loaded grillers.

37:52.560 --> 37:54.880
Both of which are now gone.

37:54.880 --> 37:55.840
Wow.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.080
No spicy tostada.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.160
No triple layer nachos.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.240
Potatoes, they don't have them anymore.

38:02.240 --> 38:02.800
What?

38:02.800 --> 38:04.960
Spicy potato soft taco, gone.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.600
Chips and dips, out.

38:07.600 --> 38:09.840
Cheesy fiesta potatoes, gone.

38:10.480 --> 38:16.720
So I just wanna say, this one really stings.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.440
A lot of my road dogs are in that list

38:19.440 --> 38:20.880
and I'm gonna miss those boys

38:20.880 --> 38:23.120
and all the different things they did to my body.

38:23.120 --> 38:25.520
So rest in peace, my friends.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.880
You know, I hope to see you back again someday.

38:28.880 --> 38:29.440
You never know.

38:30.160 --> 38:32.000
Let's take a trip over to Belgium.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.480
Let's fly this sad funeral plane over to Belgium

38:34.480 --> 38:39.040
where we're gonna say goodbye to just basic human dignity.

38:40.080 --> 38:45.600
Burger King in Belgium is offering to print customers orders

38:45.600 --> 38:49.680
on face masks so they can avoid mask mumbling.

38:49.680 --> 38:50.640
Huh.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.360
So they can avoid mask mumbling.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.320
They will print.

38:54.320 --> 38:55.600
How do they get the orders?

38:57.040 --> 39:02.320
250 of just ride or die Burger King fans over there

39:03.280 --> 39:07.360
are gonna get their order printed on a face mask

39:07.360 --> 39:10.800
that they can wear into Burger King at this point.

39:10.800 --> 39:14.400
In the biggest boldest steps we've taken

39:14.400 --> 39:16.720
towards the WALL-E future yet,

39:16.720 --> 39:19.280
you'll just be able to point at your mask

39:19.280 --> 39:24.640
to get your food slurry shaped in whatever form you want it.

39:24.640 --> 39:29.760
What this assumes is that every employee at these-

39:29.760 --> 39:31.440
It's assuming a fucking lot.

39:31.440 --> 39:32.880
I don't know how you're winnowing it down.

39:32.880 --> 39:36.720
But that every employee at every Belgian Burger King

39:36.720 --> 39:40.880
will know about this with only 250 of them being made

39:40.880 --> 39:43.200
so that when one person for the first time

39:43.200 --> 39:46.000
and maybe only time ever walks into one location

39:46.000 --> 39:49.120
and just points at their own face mask,

39:49.120 --> 39:50.560
they'll be like, ah, of course.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.360
Of course I know what that means.

39:53.360 --> 39:53.920
Got it.

39:53.920 --> 39:58.640
It also assumes that you will get the exact same thing

39:59.280 --> 40:02.400
every time you go to Burger King or is it dry erase?

40:02.400 --> 40:03.360
What's happening?

40:06.320 --> 40:11.680
The last one is rough.

40:13.840 --> 40:17.440
Kentucky Fried Chicken KFC to its friends

40:17.440 --> 40:23.360
is, it's saying goodbye, it's a finger licking good.

40:23.360 --> 40:23.840
No.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.680
Well, because of-

40:25.680 --> 40:28.480
Oh, I see.

40:28.480 --> 40:44.720
I want to say a huge thank you to Justin,

40:44.720 --> 40:48.480
not me, to a different Justin for sending this my way.

40:48.480 --> 40:53.120
But of course, yes, KFC has now on today,

40:53.760 --> 40:55.680
as we recorded this year of our Lord,

40:55.680 --> 40:57.040
and perhaps the day you're listening to it,

40:57.040 --> 41:01.040
August 24th, year of our Lord and a nominee, 2020.

41:01.040 --> 41:09.360
Today, KFC was like, hey, are we still saying finger licking good?

41:09.360 --> 41:14.880
People shouldn't do that, right?

41:14.880 --> 41:18.400
I mean, I will raise the point that

41:18.400 --> 41:23.360
if you're eating the chicken, the damage is done.

41:23.360 --> 41:23.760
Right.

41:23.760 --> 41:26.480
And fomite transmission on surfaces

41:26.480 --> 41:29.280
does not seem to be a huge vector for infection,

41:30.160 --> 41:32.480
but that's not a good slogan.

41:32.480 --> 41:34.880
That's a very long slogan, actually.

41:34.880 --> 41:40.400
So Catherine Tangillespie, Global Chief Marketing Officer at KFC,

41:40.400 --> 41:44.080
said in a statement, we find ourselves in a unique situation

41:44.720 --> 41:48.080
having an iconic slogan that doesn't quite fit

41:48.080 --> 41:49.680
in the current environment.

41:49.680 --> 41:53.760
This is, of course, a problem shared by a lot of different chains.

41:53.760 --> 41:57.440
You know, Whataburger has their longtime slogan,

41:57.440 --> 41:58.880
jam that virus inside me.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.000
And they have had to suspend that, of course.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.200
Mickey D's had to change their Lickie D's.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.440
But now they're Mickey D's, yeah.

42:07.440 --> 42:10.560
While we are pausing the use of its finger licking good-

42:10.560 --> 42:11.440
We're pausing it.

42:11.440 --> 42:12.560
It's on hiatus.

42:12.560 --> 42:15.440
It's just on hiatus until the day that,

42:15.440 --> 42:18.960
I assume the day the vaccine is made widely available.

42:18.960 --> 42:22.160
You will know, this is the reverse canary in the coal mine.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.640
You will know that the danger has passed

42:24.640 --> 42:27.040
because the kernel will proudly announce

42:27.040 --> 42:28.480
that you can once more lick your fingers.

42:28.480 --> 42:30.400
And there will be a global balloon drop.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.160
It'll be the first one of its kind.

42:32.720 --> 42:36.000
While we are pausing the use of its finger licking good,

42:36.000 --> 42:38.320
rest assured the food craved by so many people

42:38.320 --> 42:40.480
around the world isn't changing one bit.

42:40.480 --> 42:43.760
It would actually be patently insane if they were like,

42:43.760 --> 42:45.200
this food's too fucking good.

42:45.200 --> 42:49.200
It's, everybody's licking their fingers

42:49.200 --> 42:50.880
because it's so damn delicious.

42:50.880 --> 42:53.760
We have to fix, we have to fix it.

42:53.760 --> 42:55.440
Just wash your hands before you eat the chicken.

42:55.440 --> 42:58.160
Oh, Steve, I see you got some KFC for lunch.

42:58.160 --> 42:59.040
How is it?

42:59.040 --> 43:01.920
I mean, it's good, it's fine.

43:01.920 --> 43:03.680
I left my fingers filthy though.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.560
I washed my hands, which is weird.

43:07.840 --> 43:12.400
It just said, during a year when the pandemic

43:12.400 --> 43:15.200
has upended businesses and lives around the globe,

43:15.200 --> 43:19.120
use of the slogan quote, doesn't feel quite right.

43:20.080 --> 43:24.080
It is August 20 fucking fourth, okay?

43:24.080 --> 43:27.600
April, May, June, July, we're five months

43:27.600 --> 43:29.440
and change into this.

43:29.440 --> 43:32.800
And they've just now been like, no one lick your fingers.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.800
All right, that sucks, man.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.960
Yeah, it's tough times all around,

43:40.960 --> 43:44.000
but you know, you do what you can.

43:45.680 --> 43:46.800
Let's do another question.

43:48.240 --> 43:49.920
Is there a way to make exercise feel good?

43:50.720 --> 43:53.040
Lots of people claim exercise feels good,

43:53.040 --> 43:55.920
but I find it actually feels bad when our muscles hurt.

43:55.920 --> 43:56.720
It's hard to breathe.

43:56.720 --> 43:58.720
Are my endorphins broken?

43:58.720 --> 44:00.960
Am I permanently messed up from being the slowest kid

44:00.960 --> 44:02.160
in elementary school gym class?

44:02.160 --> 44:03.920
Or is there some way I can convince myself

44:03.920 --> 44:05.440
that exercise for its own sake,

44:05.440 --> 44:07.200
is it basically a form of punishment?

44:07.200 --> 44:09.440
And that's from peeves and pushups in Pasadena.

44:09.440 --> 44:13.840
If exercise felt good, I'd be doing it right now.

44:13.840 --> 44:14.880
Yeah, for sure.

44:14.880 --> 44:18.400
Yep, exercise does not feel good.

44:18.400 --> 44:19.520
This is a lie.

44:19.520 --> 44:22.720
If exercise felt good, we'd all be carved.

44:22.720 --> 44:25.120
We'd all have our beach bodies right, 24 hours a day.

44:25.120 --> 44:27.040
If exercise felt good, we'd all be shredded wheat.

44:27.040 --> 44:27.520
You know what I mean?

44:27.520 --> 44:28.800
We'd all be amazing.

44:28.800 --> 44:31.440
But the thing is, it feels good.

44:32.800 --> 44:35.440
I think the idea of it makes you feel good,

44:35.440 --> 44:38.000
but the actual practice of it hurts your body.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.760
It hurts your body to jump up and down

44:40.640 --> 44:47.040
and lift things that are heavy for no reason.

44:47.040 --> 44:49.840
That one's gonna make the old muscles and body

44:49.840 --> 44:52.560
and bones and tissue and organs hurt.

44:52.560 --> 44:55.440
I think that exercise felt good.

44:56.400 --> 44:58.240
It doesn't feel good though.

44:58.240 --> 45:01.520
Like in retrospect, you can get to the end of a run

45:01.520 --> 45:03.600
and be all sweaty, but then the sweat goes away

45:03.600 --> 45:05.520
and you're like, man, that felt good.

45:05.520 --> 45:07.440
No, that's just your body thanking you

45:07.440 --> 45:08.880
for not running anymore.

45:08.880 --> 45:09.920
Right.

45:09.920 --> 45:14.080
And even then, it will feel bad again later

45:14.080 --> 45:17.120
when you sit down for too long and go to stand up

45:17.120 --> 45:19.200
and your legs are like, fuck you,

45:19.200 --> 45:22.320
you've used me all up today, check in again.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.600
Again, tomorrow.

45:23.600 --> 45:27.600
I have a friend who did a big run

45:30.320 --> 45:36.960
with lots of other people, and his nipples were gone.

45:38.800 --> 45:42.320
And it's like, I wanna ask him in that moment

45:42.320 --> 45:44.240
as he crosses the finish line

45:44.240 --> 45:45.680
and they dump milk on him or whatever,

45:45.680 --> 45:48.720
like, how do you feel?

45:48.720 --> 45:51.920
Because I bet you right then, actually, you know what?

45:51.920 --> 45:54.960
10 feet before the finish line, how do you feel?

45:54.960 --> 45:56.400
Maybe the middle of the marathon,

45:56.400 --> 45:57.840
because when you're 10 feet from the finish line,

45:57.840 --> 45:59.360
you're probably like, oh God, it's almost over.

45:59.920 --> 46:01.840
Halfway through when you could take or leave it

46:01.840 --> 46:04.720
and your nipples are already gone,

46:05.680 --> 46:08.320
I bet you don't feel good.

46:08.320 --> 46:10.960
I bet this exercise feels quite bad in the moment.

46:10.960 --> 46:14.720
There's a point in there where your nipples begin to chafe

46:15.280 --> 46:18.240
and you think, I'm gonna keep going.

46:18.240 --> 46:20.880
And that, for me, is where the disconnect occurs.

46:21.600 --> 46:24.000
Because I would be thinking, oh, my feet are tired

46:24.000 --> 46:25.600
and my legs already kind of hurt.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.360
Wait, my nipples are hurting?

46:27.360 --> 46:30.800
I'm pretty sure they're not doing anything right now.

46:30.800 --> 46:32.640
This is clearly wrong.

46:32.640 --> 46:34.640
I'm going to go to a doctor.

46:34.640 --> 46:36.640
The time when I bet it would feel good

46:37.280 --> 46:39.920
is when I was like 18, 19, 20.

46:39.920 --> 46:41.200
Yes, absolutely.

46:41.200 --> 46:42.960
That's just more of the good.

46:42.960 --> 46:46.320
Your body, when you're young, is filled with good juice.

46:46.320 --> 46:48.240
Yes.

46:48.240 --> 46:51.680
If you exercise, it triggers your muscles

46:51.680 --> 46:54.400
to release more good juice

46:54.400 --> 46:56.400
that just makes them feel good and go forever.

46:57.520 --> 47:00.720
You hit a point, I believe it's 28,

47:00.720 --> 47:03.600
where your body's like, that's all the juice I have.

47:03.600 --> 47:06.000
There's no more good juice production.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.720
So if you exercise now, you're just using up

47:08.720 --> 47:10.240
what little juice you have left.

47:10.240 --> 47:10.740
Correct.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.880
And I think that's where I'm at now.

47:14.880 --> 47:19.040
Now, I went for a walk with my dogs yesterday

47:19.600 --> 47:23.040
and noticed about three hours later, my arms hurt.

47:23.840 --> 47:26.080
And that's when it's like my body was like,

47:26.080 --> 47:29.600
I don't know what other signals I can send you, my dude,

47:29.600 --> 47:32.880
that we are not outdoor kids.

47:32.880 --> 47:35.520
You and me, buddy, we're chair friends.

47:37.760 --> 47:38.960
Yeah, I got gamer hands.

47:39.920 --> 47:40.400
Yeah?

47:40.400 --> 47:42.080
That's tough, that's tough.

47:42.720 --> 47:44.320
And the problem is people look at me

47:44.320 --> 47:46.240
and they think Travis is a big strong boy

47:46.240 --> 47:47.360
who can do anything.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.400
Oh no, oh no.

47:48.400 --> 47:51.680
And they'll ask me, hey, can you run this marathon

47:51.680 --> 47:54.640
for charity or I need a big strong man

47:54.640 --> 47:56.800
to lift this car off of this person

47:56.800 --> 47:57.920
who's trapped underneath it.

47:57.920 --> 48:00.800
And I'm like, oh no, this is all for show.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.240
Yeah, it's decorative meat.

48:02.240 --> 48:04.400
Yeah, this is for showing, not for going.

48:04.400 --> 48:05.280
You know what I mean?

48:05.280 --> 48:08.400
I can't lift that car off of your loved one.

48:08.400 --> 48:11.440
I'm sorry, but I can take a picture of it

48:11.440 --> 48:12.720
and put it on Instagram.

48:12.720 --> 48:18.480
I have been having to wear a carpal tunnel brace

48:18.480 --> 48:22.080
on my wrist because I messed my body up

48:22.080 --> 48:24.560
because I'm old and I tried to start woodworking

48:24.560 --> 48:27.920
in my late 30s and my body's like, that's too much.

48:27.920 --> 48:30.320
You can't squeeze that drill for that long.

48:30.320 --> 48:33.440
And now my body is so ruined by the carpal tunnel

48:33.440 --> 48:36.720
that I can't even game and that's rough.

48:36.720 --> 48:37.600
Can you imagine, dude?

48:37.600 --> 48:38.720
Nah, dude, I can't even.

48:38.720 --> 48:40.320
Unless I want to do Connect.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.880
Oh, that's nice.

48:42.880 --> 48:44.000
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.920
You could just dance with the kids, you know?

48:46.560 --> 48:47.440
No, I can't dance.

48:48.160 --> 48:49.760
No, my body's riddled with pain.

48:49.760 --> 48:50.240
I can't.

48:53.280 --> 48:54.640
It's hard to sleep in.

48:54.640 --> 48:56.240
It's a large brace.

48:56.240 --> 48:58.000
And I thought you meant in your body.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.520
It's hard to sleep in my body.

49:00.240 --> 49:01.040
It ain't easy.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.120
Thank you, Mr. Ill.

49:03.120 --> 49:03.920
Appreciate it.

49:04.640 --> 49:06.480
Anyway, getting old is bad.

49:06.480 --> 49:09.280
Yesterday I was reading in my woodworking magazine

49:09.280 --> 49:12.080
and there was an ad for very small oxygen tanks

49:12.080 --> 49:15.200
that let you keep woodworking even if you need one of those.

49:15.200 --> 49:18.240
And I fucking spiraled so bad I had to lay down the floor.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.200
This is not, I'm not in any way joking.

49:23.200 --> 49:26.400
There's a man with a very tiny oxygen tank

49:26.400 --> 49:28.400
fucking doing some carving in his shop.

49:29.360 --> 49:32.560
First off, I still don't think that's a great idea.

49:32.560 --> 49:34.960
But secondly, I just fucking laid down and spiraled.

49:34.960 --> 49:36.640
I was in a bad state.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.640
Um, hey, can I do a yahoo?

49:39.360 --> 49:43.360
Wait, I forgot that I have a great new segment for you guys.

49:43.360 --> 49:43.680
Okay.

49:45.280 --> 49:47.200
So I know I already did the one about fast food,

49:47.200 --> 49:48.160
but that one's over.

49:48.160 --> 49:50.560
We've all seen it coming for some time.

49:50.560 --> 49:51.920
We've been sunsetting it.

49:51.920 --> 49:52.960
It's in its twilight.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.320
I have been getting wood magazine

49:58.000 --> 50:03.200
and wood magazine has pack-in advertisements.

50:03.200 --> 50:03.760
All right.

50:03.760 --> 50:06.080
And I just wanted to share with you guys

50:06.080 --> 50:10.560
as a member of the wood magazine target demographic,

50:11.760 --> 50:13.760
some of the products that are coming my way.

50:13.760 --> 50:14.000
Okay.

50:15.680 --> 50:19.840
First off is, it's a huge ad

50:19.840 --> 50:22.480
for advanced digital hearing aid technology,

50:22.480 --> 50:23.840
which is now rechargeable.

50:24.720 --> 50:26.800
It's about how a Chicago doctor shook up

50:26.800 --> 50:28.960
hearing aid industry with his newest invention.

50:30.080 --> 50:33.200
It's a very good, it's very good hearing aid.

50:33.200 --> 50:34.240
Seems great.

50:34.240 --> 50:35.280
Here's one.

50:35.280 --> 50:36.000
This is good.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.840
Celebrate your team in style.

50:38.560 --> 50:43.200
And it's a decanter and four small glasses

50:43.200 --> 50:46.560
with my favorite football team, the logo.

50:46.560 --> 50:48.720
And then the stopper on the decanter

50:48.720 --> 50:50.720
is a little glass football helmet.

50:50.720 --> 50:52.160
Justin, when did you retire?

50:53.280 --> 50:55.280
The crystal glasses and decanter are rimmed

50:55.280 --> 50:59.520
with gleaming 12 karat gold for beauty and years of use.

51:00.640 --> 51:01.280
So this is-

51:01.280 --> 51:04.080
So these advertisements are not necessarily

51:04.080 --> 51:06.960
for woodworking supplies.

51:06.960 --> 51:10.560
It's for exactly the demographic of woodworking magazines.

51:10.560 --> 51:12.800
For example, here's a model,

51:12.800 --> 51:14.800
a let Coke refresh you behind the wheel

51:14.800 --> 51:16.560
of a daring Bel Air.

51:16.560 --> 51:18.880
This is an exclusive Hamilton debut

51:18.880 --> 51:25.120
of a small scale model of a one to 18 scale,

51:25.680 --> 51:29.760
11 inch long Coca-Cola car.

51:29.760 --> 51:33.600
It's a Chevrolet Bel Air with Coca-Cola graphics on it.

51:33.600 --> 51:34.400
Beautiful.

51:34.400 --> 51:36.560
Huh, beautiful.

51:36.560 --> 51:40.400
And just three payments of 33.33

51:41.200 --> 51:45.840
and then you could own this fucking Bel Air

51:45.840 --> 51:47.840
with Coke logos all over for a hundred dollars.

51:47.840 --> 51:51.120
Justin, does every advertisement begin with,

51:51.120 --> 51:53.040
you're reading a woodworking magazine.

51:53.040 --> 51:55.360
So we assume you've got disposable income.

51:56.160 --> 51:57.440
We assume you're burning it.

51:57.440 --> 52:00.000
You're old and ready to blow it all.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.400
You don't want to leave anything to your ungrateful kids.

52:02.400 --> 52:03.840
So check out this decanter

52:03.840 --> 52:05.520
with your favorite sports team on it.

52:05.520 --> 52:07.680
Now in that same price range,

52:09.520 --> 52:12.320
limited to 95 casting days,

52:12.320 --> 52:15.520
skillfully handcrafted and painted by hand,

52:15.520 --> 52:18.480
this all new collectible pays tribute to Budweiser,

52:18.480 --> 52:21.360
the king of beers and the classic Woody wagon.

52:21.360 --> 52:22.640
For just a hundred dollars,

52:22.640 --> 52:26.160
I can have a small car with Budweiser written on it

52:26.160 --> 52:29.760
and it looks like a wagon and it's 11 inches long

52:29.760 --> 52:31.840
and I can buy it for a hundred dollars.

52:31.840 --> 52:33.680
It's a Studebaker Woody wagon.

52:33.680 --> 52:34.640
Say that?

52:34.640 --> 52:38.000
Studebaker, you say it, funny guy.

52:40.560 --> 52:44.240
Vintage slogans and graphics complete its classic look

52:44.240 --> 52:47.200
and you can just buy that and you can own this small.

52:47.200 --> 52:49.440
You see these things and you're like, how did these,

52:50.240 --> 52:52.000
you see these things second, right?

52:52.000 --> 52:55.360
At secondary places and you're like, that's a weird item.

52:55.360 --> 52:56.720
How did this get,

52:56.720 --> 52:59.360
what was the primary entrance of this item

52:59.360 --> 53:01.840
into the ecosystem, you know what I'm saying?

53:01.840 --> 53:04.320
Somebody must have called Budweiser enough times

53:04.320 --> 53:07.920
and said like, hey, do you guys sell models of your,

53:07.920 --> 53:10.320
I mean, you see this kind of stuff at a secondhand store

53:10.320 --> 53:11.680
and you're like, that's fucking weird.

53:11.680 --> 53:13.040
But you don't stop to consider

53:13.040 --> 53:18.160
how it made its primary entrance into earth.

53:18.160 --> 53:19.440
And this is how they're getting in,

53:19.440 --> 53:20.880
it's through the Bradford Exchange.

53:20.880 --> 53:23.200
I have one more Bradford Exchange piece, I think.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.800
Can I also just say real quick,

53:24.800 --> 53:25.760
this is a slight tangent,

53:25.760 --> 53:28.240
but you mentioning Budweiser,

53:28.240 --> 53:29.280
it suddenly clicked for me,

53:29.280 --> 53:31.120
a really good spokesperson for Budweiser

53:31.120 --> 53:32.080
would be Paul Reiser.

53:32.720 --> 53:34.960
And like, just say like, I'm Paul Reiser for Budweiser.

53:34.960 --> 53:36.880
And that's just made me really happy.

53:36.880 --> 53:37.840
That kicks ass, Travis.

53:38.480 --> 53:39.200
That was cool, dude.

53:39.760 --> 53:43.600
Spirit of the West Express Silver Edition.

53:44.720 --> 53:47.520
You can celebrate the 100th anniversary

53:47.520 --> 53:49.440
of the Indian head nickel

53:49.440 --> 53:52.240
with this real working electric train collection.

53:52.240 --> 53:52.740
What?

53:53.440 --> 53:56.160
Are you fucking kidding me with this?

53:56.160 --> 53:57.440
Here's some things it said.

53:57.440 --> 53:59.360
Oh, I did want to tell you, by the way,

53:59.360 --> 54:00.480
on the Budweiser thing,

54:00.480 --> 54:04.160
it has this big star emblazoned on it

54:04.160 --> 54:04.880
and written in there.

54:04.880 --> 54:07.920
It says, officially licensed by Anheuser-Busch.

54:07.920 --> 54:10.800
It'd be pretty fucking crazy if it wasn't, huh?

54:10.800 --> 54:11.520
If they're just like,

54:11.520 --> 54:12.880
hey, we're just making a Budweiser car,

54:12.880 --> 54:13.440
what do we care?

54:15.040 --> 54:17.280
With the Bradford Exchange, you can't touch us.

54:17.280 --> 54:18.240
Can't touch us.

54:19.200 --> 54:19.920
You know who we are.

54:21.120 --> 54:23.440
So there's this, imagine a person who's like,

54:23.440 --> 54:26.960
I did want to mark the centennial of this great nickel,

54:26.960 --> 54:28.880
so I'm going to buy a silver train

54:28.880 --> 54:30.560
to mark this exciting occasion.

54:31.120 --> 54:32.800
It's an electric train,

54:32.800 --> 54:36.000
and you get some pieces of track

54:36.880 --> 54:38.240
need to run your train,

54:38.880 --> 54:43.760
and it's got a nickel replica on the front,

54:43.760 --> 54:44.880
and it's made of silver,

54:45.600 --> 54:53.280
and it's, let's see, three easy payments of 26.66,

54:53.280 --> 54:56.480
and then you get other cars for more money.

54:57.360 --> 54:59.040
Minted for only 26 years,

54:59.680 --> 55:00.880
that seems like a long time.

55:00.880 --> 55:03.280
I feel like you could make a lot of nickels in there.

55:03.280 --> 55:07.840
Considering the Budweiser car only has 95 casting days,

55:07.840 --> 55:10.720
I have to say, 26 years is a very long time.

55:10.720 --> 55:12.000
I've never made a nickel before,

55:12.000 --> 55:14.480
and I think I could make a lot of nickels in 26 years.

55:15.200 --> 55:16.080
I bet you could.

55:18.320 --> 55:21.360
What's great about that is that train sitting on a shelf

55:21.360 --> 55:24.400
would be the best way, like,

55:24.400 --> 55:26.960
it's like a prime example of a thing

55:26.960 --> 55:29.760
that like an adult kid would walk into

55:29.760 --> 55:32.000
and see on a parent's shelf and think,

55:32.720 --> 55:33.600
fuck you, Dad.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.680
I remember, Dad, when you told me

55:35.680 --> 55:37.360
you wouldn't help me buy my first car

55:37.360 --> 55:39.680
because I had to learn to be responsible with money.

55:39.680 --> 55:40.560
Fuck you, Dad.

55:41.120 --> 55:42.480
Now you're just blowing $100.

55:43.040 --> 55:44.480
Think of all the times in your life

55:44.480 --> 55:45.920
you didn't have $100,

55:45.920 --> 55:48.320
and now you have $100 to buy a Budweiser truck

55:48.320 --> 55:52.080
that you won't let your grandkids play with,

55:52.080 --> 55:52.880
because I know you.

55:55.280 --> 55:56.880
On this silver train set,

55:56.880 --> 56:01.520
it says that you pay the $26.66 for three easy payments,

56:01.520 --> 56:03.920
then you keep getting the fucking trains,

56:03.920 --> 56:06.400
and then it said you could cancel any time.

56:06.400 --> 56:06.880
What?

56:06.880 --> 56:10.720
And the idea that you would change

56:10.720 --> 56:12.560
from a person that would want this

56:12.560 --> 56:14.560
to a person that wouldn't want this

56:14.560 --> 56:17.040
at this point in your life is unfathomable to me.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.720
I'm assuming the only cancellations

56:18.720 --> 56:20.480
are usually part of a state settlement.

56:20.480 --> 56:23.520
I have to imagine that is the only actual cancellation

56:23.520 --> 56:24.800
of this product that ever occurs.

56:25.360 --> 56:26.960
Why am I still getting this?

56:26.960 --> 56:27.840
Oh, wow.

56:27.840 --> 56:29.280
Thank you so much for listening to our program,

56:29.280 --> 56:30.080
my brother, my brother, me.

56:30.080 --> 56:31.920
We hope you have enjoyed yourself.

56:31.920 --> 56:34.400
Hey, will you get our podcasting book?

56:35.280 --> 56:36.160
It's right over there.

56:36.160 --> 56:37.200
Can you just hand it to me?

56:38.240 --> 56:39.680
I know we make this look easy,

56:39.680 --> 56:41.680
but it's actually quite a challenge

56:41.680 --> 56:43.440
and we could teach you how we do it.

56:43.440 --> 56:46.080
It's called Everybody Has a Pocket.

56:46.080 --> 56:47.360
Is it everyone?

56:47.360 --> 56:48.320
I can never remember.

56:49.040 --> 56:51.040
I came up with the name and I still don't remember.

56:51.040 --> 56:52.480
Everybody has a podcast except you

56:53.360 --> 56:54.640
and it's coming out in January,

56:54.640 --> 56:55.920
but you can pre-order it now.

56:56.480 --> 57:00.480
So please do that at wherever fine books are sold.

57:00.480 --> 57:04.240
I wanted to say the last like 72 hours

57:04.240 --> 57:06.480
have been pretty sort of horrifying,

57:06.480 --> 57:07.840
nationally speaking.

57:08.480 --> 57:10.000
And I would encourage everybody

57:10.000 --> 57:12.320
to find some way to chip in to help

57:12.320 --> 57:14.880
both with the California wildfires.

57:14.880 --> 57:18.080
There's no shortage of places that you can donate to

57:18.080 --> 57:22.400
or mutual aid funds that you can support

57:22.400 --> 57:24.720
for specific communities affected by the wildfires

57:25.600 --> 57:30.320
and also finding ways to support Black Lives Matter

57:30.320 --> 57:32.800
and the Milwaukee Freedom Fund

57:32.800 --> 57:34.960
who's working with protesters

57:34.960 --> 57:36.960
over Jacob Blake's shooting,

57:36.960 --> 57:41.280
which is fucking infuriating in Kenosha.

57:41.280 --> 57:43.840
Yeah, we'll have links in the episode description.

57:43.840 --> 57:46.400
And yeah, think about helping out with that

57:46.400 --> 57:50.000
because shit is super rough right now.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.280
Along those same lines,

57:51.280 --> 57:53.040
make sure that you are registered to vote.

57:53.040 --> 57:58.560
There was a lot of voter registration purging over time

57:58.560 --> 58:01.040
and if you change addresses, anything like that,

58:01.040 --> 58:02.720
it's really easy to check.

58:02.720 --> 58:05.440
Don't wait on it because we're probably going to need

58:05.440 --> 58:09.360
to do a lot of early and mail-in

58:09.360 --> 58:11.840
and absentee ballots

58:11.840 --> 58:16.240
and that is going to probably be a fucking mess.

58:16.240 --> 58:19.360
Fucking shitty, fucking sucks shit.

58:19.360 --> 58:21.120
So make sure that you're registered now.

58:21.120 --> 58:25.200
If not, get registered and then vote against Donald Trump.

58:26.560 --> 58:28.240
Yeah, also thanks to John Roderick

58:28.240 --> 58:29.760
and the Longwinter Sheaths for a theme song

58:29.760 --> 58:30.880
and to departure off the album,

58:30.880 --> 58:31.840
Putting the Days to Bed.

58:32.560 --> 58:34.320
And thank you for listening.

58:34.320 --> 58:36.240
Thanks Maximum Fun for having us on the network

58:36.240 --> 58:39.680
and let's take it to the bridge.

58:39.680 --> 58:41.600
By which I mean the conclusion.

58:41.600 --> 58:43.200
Let's do it.

58:43.200 --> 58:45.360
This final Yahoo was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

58:45.360 --> 58:47.200
Thank you Adrian, Yahoo Answers user.

58:47.200 --> 58:49.280
Anonymous Deadpool also asked this one,

58:49.280 --> 58:51.920
very irreverent and very funny.

58:51.920 --> 58:54.320
And he kicks ass and he asks,

58:55.440 --> 59:00.160
is the TMNT movie from 1990 significant?

59:00.160 --> 59:06.640
And the answer is Justin.

59:06.640 --> 59:07.200
The answer is Justin.

59:07.200 --> 59:09.040
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:09.040 --> 59:10.320
Yeah, I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:10.320 --> 59:12.960
Sorry, that question has me on a journey.

59:13.600 --> 59:14.640
This has been my brother,

59:14.640 --> 59:34.240
my brother may kiss your dad's square on the lips.
