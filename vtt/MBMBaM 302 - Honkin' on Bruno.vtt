00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.160
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the

00:48.160 --> 00:53.360
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, brought to you by Captain America

00:53.360 --> 00:59.280
Civil War in theaters now. I'm your middle-est brother, Ant-Man. I'm your... I almost said

00:59.280 --> 01:02.880
middle-est brother, but that would be a lie. I'm the sweet baby brother. That's a fucking lie.

01:02.880 --> 01:07.120
That is my branding. I mean, uh-oh, we got a civil war of our own, brother against brother.

01:07.120 --> 01:11.040
I want to be the middle-est brother. I want to switch ages with Travis, and I think I found a

01:11.040 --> 01:16.000
witch on the internet that can do that for me. We could do it through cryogenic freezing,

01:16.000 --> 01:22.240
much like, spoiler alert, the winter soldier Bucky Barnes. Captain America Civil War pits

01:22.240 --> 01:26.720
Captain America. Is this an official watch? Is this an official Civil War watch? This is an official

01:26.720 --> 01:30.400
Captain America Civil War watch. All right, you know what that means. Let me scoop up all my

01:30.400 --> 01:36.800
DVD copies of Kung Fu Panda 3 and throw them right into the burnerator. We should also say

01:36.800 --> 01:41.600
that nothing we're about to say should be taken as fact. I don't want anyone yelling at me about

01:41.600 --> 01:47.200
spoilers because none of this is true. Now, let me give a straight recap of the plot,

01:47.200 --> 01:51.280
and then we'll get into some jokes about it. Okay. Okay. Just to get set the ground rules. Okay. So,

01:51.280 --> 01:57.040
Iron Man loves slaves. Uh-huh. And he wants nothing more than to keep his massive army of

01:57.040 --> 02:01.040
slaves. Exactly. Plus, that's how he made all of his money off of his plantations. And who do you

02:01.040 --> 02:08.240
think builds all of his many, many robotic armor suits for him? It's not him, and it's not Pepper

02:08.240 --> 02:14.080
Potts. Yeah, it's not Pepper Potts. It's Iron Man, and he's a slaver, and he loves slaves.

02:14.080 --> 02:19.520
Captain America is like, not on my watch, girlfriend, and they get into a big scrap about it.

02:19.520 --> 02:23.200
Some of the superheroes love slaves. Yeah, a lot of them like really, really, really. Well,

02:23.200 --> 02:28.880
some of them, yeah, some of them do. Not all. The ones you would expect, right? Slave man,

02:28.880 --> 02:36.640
definitely. Definitely. Okay. Dr. Racist, he definitely loves slaves. Yeah. But there are

02:36.640 --> 02:44.080
some surprises in there, too. The gentrifier. Yeah. She loves slavery. Cheap labor woman.

02:44.080 --> 02:52.480
The overseer. The overseer. And, of course, Ant-Man, which is like, what? So weird. What?

02:53.680 --> 02:56.640
What? Well, you have to know that Ant stands for antebellum.

03:01.360 --> 03:06.960
We're off to the races. So that's the film. Captain America, Civil War Watch. I guess the

03:06.960 --> 03:13.600
question on everybody's mind is, Travis, how many times have you seen it? 16, Justin. Now,

03:13.600 --> 03:18.480
is this just back-to-back feelings? No, they were just one chunk at a time. I had to take breaks

03:18.480 --> 03:23.680
because it was too intense. The racism was a little, it kind of like filled up the theater

03:23.680 --> 03:31.120
with a weird energy. It was like a Trump rally in there. It was really off-putting. Especially

03:31.120 --> 03:36.640
when the racists win. Yeah. And I don't want to spoil anything, but racism is not only,

03:36.640 --> 03:40.560
it's like codified by the end of it. They put it in the Constitution. Yeah. And I don't think that

03:40.560 --> 03:45.200
they should do that. And Iron Man wrote it. And he was wearing the Iron Man suit when he wrote it

03:45.200 --> 03:49.280
by pen. So it's almost illegible. Which I think constitutional scholars are going to be arguing,

03:49.280 --> 03:56.480
is that a comma? Or is it a apostrophe? Or is it a J? That's how bad Iron Man, when in his suit,

03:56.480 --> 04:01.280
his penmanship is. Just think about it. Just think about it. You're not seeing a lot of documents in

04:01.280 --> 04:05.760
there. I think the weirdest part is at the end when Bruce Banner is walking away sadly and he

04:05.760 --> 04:11.440
looks at the camera and says, who knew that the Hulk's one weakness was racism? Yeah. It's really

04:11.440 --> 04:18.320
weak, but powerful. Yeah. All right, boys, let's see. We got to talk about it. Whose team are you

04:18.320 --> 04:24.400
on? Iron Man or Captain America? Which one was the racist team? Yeah. The one that's not racist,

04:24.400 --> 04:29.440
I guess. Right? Definitely. I'm going to say the non-racist team. I mean, I do love Ant-Man.

04:29.440 --> 04:33.840
Yeah. I mean, I love Ant-Man. Yeah. That's the problem is Paul Rudd puts on a great character

04:33.840 --> 04:41.440
portrayal of Ant, the Ant-Man. But the problem is- Okay, let me gauge your guys' opinion. Is Paul

04:41.440 --> 04:47.440
Rudd America's most lovable racist? I don't want to espouse that sort of sentence. He's playing

04:47.440 --> 04:51.360
a role. He's playing a role. I mean, it's not him. Oh, damn. No, I mean, as his portrayal,

04:51.360 --> 04:56.240
does he make Ant-Man America's most lovable racist? You know what I heard? He was on set.

04:56.240 --> 05:00.480
He was actually kind of difficult to work with, which I can't even imagine because it is him.

05:00.480 --> 05:07.680
But I think I've heard in the magazines that he was on some Jared Leto shit, just being kind of

05:08.720 --> 05:16.000
racially charged. He also insisted that everyone be bigger than him. Which is so weird.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.920
That's how they did that. Do you know that they did that effect? Yeah. And it's very wasteful.

05:21.920 --> 05:27.840
Yeah. But when he shrinks, they just made everything around him very big. Yeah, like in

05:27.840 --> 05:32.400
The Hobbit. Yeah, except times a billion because it's like, make a gun the size of a building,

05:32.400 --> 05:36.560
make an Anthony Mackie the size of a town. And it's all practical. And it's all practical.

05:37.680 --> 05:46.000
If you go to Muncie, there's a giant statue of Anthony Mackie. And it's like,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.240
well, we just didn't have anything else to do. Where are we going to put him? Yeah,

05:48.240 --> 05:52.560
that's just where they left the biomech suit that they put regular sized Anthony Mackie in.

05:52.560 --> 05:57.040
All right, this next segment's for all the comic book nerds out there. Who's your favorite

05:57.040 --> 06:04.000
comic book hero cameo in this one? Because mine was Red Boy who teamed up with Iron Man,

06:04.000 --> 06:08.960
which was a little bit disappointing. But I loved, I was surprised to see Red Boy in there.

06:08.960 --> 06:17.120
He had such a limited run in Image Comics comics. I liked the cat guy. Which one? The cat guy.

06:17.120 --> 06:22.400
Kitty Cat Man. Kitty Cat Man. Yeah. Kitty Cat Man jumped around really good. He jumped around

06:22.400 --> 06:28.640
fast and strong. And at one point he jumped and I was like, ooh, good kitty. And it was pretty cool.

06:29.520 --> 06:36.400
I liked the great emancipate Thor, which was Thor in an Abraham Lincoln costume,

06:36.400 --> 06:41.280
as if we wouldn't notice. Oh, I thought that that was Abraham Lincoln had picked up Thor's hammer.

06:41.280 --> 06:48.480
No. Oh, I misread that. Okay, let me say this. If you and our presidents are able and worthy

06:48.480 --> 06:53.440
to read the power of Moulnier, it would definitely be an Abraham Lincoln. Did you just say Moulnier

06:53.440 --> 06:58.160
like it was French? Moulnier. Moulnier. Like it was a French philosopher? How do you pronounce it?

06:58.800 --> 07:05.520
What do you say, Trav? Mjolnir the hammer. Mjolnir. Mjolnir. Mjolnir. Mjolnir. Mjolnir.

07:05.520 --> 07:11.360
Mjolnir. That's just a little joke I like to make to teach people about nir and far. Mjolnir.

07:11.360 --> 07:19.440
Mjolnir. I guess the side I'm on is Captain America Civil War II. How about at Hollywood,

07:19.440 --> 07:23.200
I'm ready. I'm not getting out of my chair until it shows up on the screen.

07:23.200 --> 07:28.240
I want Captain America Civil War II to just be like, I'm mad at you again. Well, I'm mad at you

07:28.240 --> 07:33.040
again. I'm still mad at you from the first time. I'm red boy. Just kidding, red boy dies in the

07:33.040 --> 07:39.760
first one. Kitty cat man eats him and then spits him back up. Kitty cat man eats him whole. Let's

07:39.760 --> 07:45.120
um, God, we can't go an episode without a voice. Spits out a voice. Yeah. Can we do some advice?

07:46.720 --> 07:52.320
Yes. But go see Captain America Civil War. Support indie projects. Support indie comics.

07:52.320 --> 07:55.680
Local. Happy free comic book movie day. Go see it. It's free.

07:57.920 --> 08:01.600
Hey brothers, I want to give you all- I went to free comic book day, by the way. And before

08:01.600 --> 08:06.720
I lay waste to the free comic book day, I spent like $150 at my comic book shop. So

08:06.720 --> 08:12.800
I'm supporting the whole industry, I guess. Um, I had never done free comic book day and I rolled

08:12.800 --> 08:17.360
up and I was like, free comics, here they come. And they're like, here's an Archie little sampler.

08:17.360 --> 08:22.800
It's three pages long. It's like, I can't finish to this. You know what I mean? That's horse samples.

08:22.800 --> 08:27.040
I got that same Archie and it's the entire first episode and it's a bolded direction for the

08:27.040 --> 08:32.720
franchise. Well, damn, you put me on blast. Yeah. Maybe if you're going to make a joke,

08:32.720 --> 08:35.760
it should be about something that's real. I guess I just prefer graphic novels,

08:35.760 --> 08:40.080
you know, something with a little bit more meat and heft to it. A little bit more seriousness,

08:40.080 --> 08:44.720
less play play. You know what I like is saga. You guys read saga? Fuck yeah, saga.

08:44.720 --> 08:50.240
Good book. Did you buy any saga? No, I bought that new Hawkeye. Let's move on though. Hell yeah.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.760
My spouse and I will be attending a rather unconventional wedding and weekend retreat.

08:53.760 --> 08:57.040
The bride and groom are total hippies. And according to the invitation, we can expect

08:57.040 --> 09:02.320
such activities as clothing, optional pool parties and all nights unspecified quote ritual.

09:02.320 --> 09:07.840
Justin, you added a fucking Yogi Bear extra syllable to the word activities.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.200
And I'm going to. Activities?

09:09.200 --> 09:10.160
Activities.

09:12.160 --> 09:17.680
I'm here to participate in the activities. Excuse me.

09:17.680 --> 09:19.440
I'm Antebellum Man.

09:19.440 --> 09:24.880
Where can I put my cane? I'm Antebellum Man. I'm here for the activities.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.200
I would like a MoMA Mojito.

09:29.200 --> 09:33.600
Oh, you know, the famous southern drink, the MoMA Mojito.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.720
Mojito MoMo. All right, go on.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.120
I got Tommy Hilfiger trunks. All right.

09:43.120 --> 09:48.560
But my real quandary is what to wear. The requested attire for the ceremony is,

09:48.560 --> 09:50.480
quote, elegant.

09:50.480 --> 09:56.800
That is not a thing. That's not. That's some my fair wedding with David to Tara

09:56.800 --> 10:00.240
Candace chic bullshit. That's not anything.

10:01.360 --> 10:05.280
I need some. It's their wedding, Griffin. I need some in style of Vice Brothers.

10:05.280 --> 10:12.960
Can I get some specific suggestions for elegant, kooky men's and women's clothing that will be

10:12.960 --> 10:18.080
wedding appropriate? That's from Wacky Wedding Wardrobe Woes in Washington.

10:18.080 --> 10:22.240
And let's not kid around. That place is going to be a Zoot Suit riot.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.120
I mean, 100% right?

10:23.120 --> 10:24.560
It's going to be amazing.

10:24.560 --> 10:28.560
I want, okay, I also just want to like jump right out there and say,

10:28.560 --> 10:31.200
I don't have a problem with you saying I want my wedding.

10:31.200 --> 10:35.280
I want people to wear like eccentric kooky attire.

10:35.280 --> 10:39.040
But when you say a term like elegant kooky, that's just not a fit.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.760
Like that's just not a classification.

10:41.760 --> 10:46.240
It's going to be a fucking Paula Poundstone cosplay convention up in this shit.

10:46.240 --> 10:51.440
Yeah. You might as well just say like, I want it to be wacky formal.

10:51.440 --> 10:55.440
Like what is that? Does that mean I show up in a tuxedo t-shirt?

10:55.440 --> 10:57.760
Does that mean I wear my suit backwards?

10:57.760 --> 11:02.480
Does that mean that it's like black tie and also silk tunic?

11:02.480 --> 11:03.040
This is why I put them-

11:03.040 --> 11:03.920
I don't know.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.920
It's your wedding day, chase your bliss, do whatever.

11:05.920 --> 11:09.200
But this is one thing where your bliss can't be chased.

11:09.200 --> 11:13.520
You need to let your bliss run away and then you chase your pragmatism.

11:13.520 --> 11:17.520
Because this isn't a direction that you were giving literally every person that's coming

11:17.520 --> 11:20.320
to your wedding and elegant kooky doesn't mean a fucking thing.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.080
It doesn't fucking mean anything.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.480
It carries no connotation whatsoever.

11:25.600 --> 11:30.640
I would definitely, like to me, I would definitely want to wear

11:32.480 --> 11:35.120
basically everything F. Murray Abraham Warren Amadeus.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.440
This would be my one chance.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.240
Oh, this is fun.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.520
Where would you go with it?

11:39.520 --> 11:41.440
To definitely get, I would go frock.

11:41.440 --> 11:46.800
I would have like the whole look, the powdered wig, that whole fun thing.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.920
Maybe like birds in there, birds in my wig, that kind of thing.

11:49.920 --> 11:50.320
Oh yeah.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.280
I love that style.

11:51.920 --> 11:58.000
I think I would go tear away tuxedo and then I would be wearing,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.720
inspired by the flop house, a tux speedo underneath.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.200
That's fun.

12:01.200 --> 12:01.760
Oh, nice.

12:02.480 --> 12:06.080
I would go full, I mean, you guys know, I already said I would totally pound my stone,

12:06.960 --> 12:11.600
but I would also have like a little bit of the mask, like the Cuban Pete scene in there.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.120
By which I mean, I would be wearing a latex, the mask mask.

12:15.120 --> 12:15.680
Oh yeah.

12:15.680 --> 12:16.160
From the mask.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.240
Nothing says elegant kooky like the mask.

12:18.240 --> 12:21.040
But also again, big suit, big suit, big tie, big, loud tie,

12:21.040 --> 12:23.440
big, loud colors, big, loud pinstripe suit.

12:24.240 --> 12:24.720
I would wear-

12:24.720 --> 12:25.520
But cut out.

12:25.520 --> 12:27.120
But cut out suspenders.

12:27.120 --> 12:32.480
I would wear a very regular normal tux, except when you get like super close,

12:32.480 --> 12:34.160
you can see it's all fruit by the foot.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.240
Oh, that's pretty kooky.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.560
And if you want, and I'm like, and when people get close enough,

12:38.560 --> 12:40.880
I just like whispering in the air, like, want a nibble?

12:41.520 --> 12:41.920
Like that.

12:41.920 --> 12:42.800
Want a nibble?

12:42.800 --> 12:44.560
Now you're getting into spooky kooky.

12:44.560 --> 12:44.960
Yeah.

12:44.960 --> 12:45.360
Nibble.

12:46.000 --> 12:46.480
That's good.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.840
I mean, that's kooky is all good.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.760
What about like a body paint suit?

12:50.320 --> 12:51.120
Okay.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.040
I feel like that's elegant kooky.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.640
Like I'm trying to think what you got to get the kooky and you got to get the elegant.

12:56.640 --> 12:57.760
That's like, that's like that.

12:57.760 --> 12:58.000
Okay.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.800
That's a great look if you're beautiful and cut.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.200
And I'm assuming a lot of people at this wedding will be.

13:03.200 --> 13:03.760
Yeah, absolutely.

13:03.760 --> 13:04.240
Definitely.

13:04.240 --> 13:07.840
If I show up in a body painted tuxedo, people are just going to be shouting like,

13:07.840 --> 13:09.200
that man is made of eels.

13:09.200 --> 13:09.600
Yeah.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.120
Somebody, somebody stop him.

13:11.120 --> 13:11.840
Help that man.

13:11.840 --> 13:19.680
Can we, can I just go in a regular suit that I have poured a bunch of soup all over?

13:21.440 --> 13:22.560
You mean a soup suit.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.400
I'm talking about my soup suit riot.

13:24.400 --> 13:24.720
Riot.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.600
Don't buy the bottle of chunky.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.840
It'll be a multiple soup situation.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.360
I can do chili in my pocket.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.920
And then like when I, when somebody is like,

13:33.920 --> 13:36.240
does anybody have anything they want to say to stop this wedding?

13:36.240 --> 13:37.280
Which is what they say.

13:37.280 --> 13:41.360
Then you, you slap your pocket and like chili comes splatting out all over the place.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.520
And people are like, Griffin, you got us again.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.480
I like that Griffin, because you're not just a guest, you're the caterer.

13:46.480 --> 13:46.720
Yes.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.280
You're going to wear a suit, a soup stain suit.

13:49.280 --> 13:54.160
You better hope that everybody's aim with the bird seed at the end is, is very great.

13:54.160 --> 13:54.400
Yeah.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.040
Like very good.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.640
If they're throwing rice and it just sticks to you,

13:56.640 --> 13:58.960
you're going to turn into a one man golden grail for birds.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.680
When I was in, when I was in college and I needed money,

14:01.680 --> 14:05.440
I would go to high end parties and I would be naked.

14:05.440 --> 14:09.200
And I would just like lie down on a big table naked and people would eat,

14:09.200 --> 14:12.800
not sushi off of my nude body, but just different soups.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.000
There's different soups and you're from your crevices, you mean?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.520
Well, no, it was just kind of caked on.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.200
They had to like really scrape it.

14:19.200 --> 14:19.840
It was old soup.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.040
It was a real dry soup.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.760
Like a real dry, old, dry, old, dry soup.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.960
Like powdered soup.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.200
And they would have to scrape it off into,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.200
I would actually just hold it in my hands for them.

14:29.200 --> 14:32.000
The fresh hot soup I would hold in my hands and just sort of lift up to their mouth.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.120
Here you go, sir.

14:33.120 --> 14:33.840
Please enjoy.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.840
Maybe just wear a regular ass tuxedo.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.240
And then when people say like, what's the kooky element?

14:40.240 --> 14:42.160
Look them down the eye and just like, don't you get it?

14:42.720 --> 14:44.400
And then put it back on them.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.360
Make them cook it up.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.640
Or just like a Marvin the Martian tie.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.600
Can you wear a tuxedo top, cargo shorts bottom?

14:54.480 --> 14:55.360
Oh, that's fun.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.320
Ooh, I like that.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.880
That's very like 80s, early 90s.

14:58.880 --> 14:59.520
When I was in-

14:59.520 --> 15:02.880
You would see that character in like a college comedy.

15:02.880 --> 15:06.320
I used to do formal top, shorts, bottom.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.720
I discovered that look in middle school a lot.

15:09.840 --> 15:10.880
And I wore it a lot.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.440
And I'm looking back at it now.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.920
Let me close my eyes and like really get a picture of my mind's eye

15:15.920 --> 15:16.720
because I'm pretty sure.

15:16.720 --> 15:17.440
Oh, yep.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.600
I did look like Laura Dern in Jurassic Park.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.640
Are you talking about a look that I know myself,

15:24.640 --> 15:31.840
I sort of like endeavored into was like a long sleeve plaid with jorts.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.880
Was like one that I know that I definitely had at some point.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.440
And felt, and the weird thing was because it had buttons on it.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.040
I felt like pretty good about it.

15:39.040 --> 15:39.840
Yeah, like, yeah.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.960
I'm making a go at this thing called fashion today.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.640
I was not above in high school.

15:44.640 --> 15:48.880
I remember at least once probably multiple times wore a dress shirt,

15:48.880 --> 15:51.840
like a button up dress shirt and tear away pants,

15:51.840 --> 15:54.160
like tear away workout pants.

15:54.960 --> 15:58.160
And I was like, yeah, because I was like in show choir and theater and stuff.

15:58.160 --> 16:01.360
So it was cool you guys until even like the show choir kids were like,

16:01.360 --> 16:04.960
came you, you need to not, you need to get that shit together.

16:04.960 --> 16:08.400
I wore tear away pants to gym class just to make it easier on the bullies.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.680
Wait, the bullies were just tearing your pants off?

16:11.680 --> 16:12.240
But that's it.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.080
Just shred my pants off like pants hyenas.

16:14.080 --> 16:14.880
But that's it.

16:14.880 --> 16:18.400
Like you made it too easy on them and they didn't want to do it anymore.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.840
Ah, this isn't even fun anymore.

16:19.840 --> 16:20.720
It's like he likes it.

16:21.280 --> 16:25.600
Yeah, I did just wear sweatpants and a t-shirt to school forever

16:25.600 --> 16:29.040
when I was in gym because I couldn't change in the locker room.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.480
So I just wore gym clothes.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.120
God.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.360
All right, let's do a Yahoo.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.000
Yeah, please get me out of this fucking pit.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.600
Yeah, we're all really deep in this pit,

16:37.600 --> 16:39.120
but that's okay because we've been here before.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.720
Elegant kooky.

16:42.320 --> 16:47.520
This one was sent in by Rachel Roseng, game recognized game.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.160
Thank you, Rachel.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

16:50.000 --> 16:50.800
Oh, they're anonymous.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.400
In the sports martial arts category, they ask,

16:54.400 --> 16:55.280
oh, let's give them a name.

16:55.280 --> 17:03.120
Uh, Purchase, Purchase, not Precious asks, I want to learn MMA,

17:03.120 --> 17:05.040
but I am worried about safety.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.720
I know it's a stupid concern as fighting is not a safe thing to do,

17:08.720 --> 17:12.400
but I really want to be able to defend myself without losing all my brain function.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.000
How do MMA classes normally deal with average working people

17:16.000 --> 17:19.040
who don't go down the professional route as like a hobby?

17:19.920 --> 17:20.960
I want to learn MMA.

17:20.960 --> 17:24.400
Is this the getting hit part?

17:24.960 --> 17:26.720
I could do without that part.

17:26.720 --> 17:29.680
That's actually, this is actually not a terrible question

17:29.680 --> 17:36.000
because like, how do you do, how do you do like amateur MMA

17:36.000 --> 17:37.280
in such a way that you make it clear?

17:37.280 --> 17:42.000
Like, I know I could do it better with harder hitting,

17:42.560 --> 17:44.720
but I just, that's not where I'm.

17:44.720 --> 17:48.160
Well, this is predicated on the existence of another person

17:48.160 --> 17:52.880
who doesn't want to do the punching part of it and only wants to be hit.

17:54.160 --> 17:58.880
But is this person concerned about the death toll of MMA classes?

17:58.880 --> 18:00.560
Like, we lost another one.

18:00.560 --> 18:07.520
Like, I would have to think this is a concern that has been dealt with before now.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.800
Like a teacher going, wait, no one wants to get hit, huh?

18:10.800 --> 18:11.600
Oh, damn it.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.480
I want to go out on a limb and bet that number eight, zero though.

18:14.480 --> 18:18.640
Like, I'm going to go out, yeah, it ain't nothing.

18:18.640 --> 18:24.480
When you go to the part where you're training regular, okay,

18:24.480 --> 18:31.680
and learn all the moves, and then when it's time to spar with a partner,

18:32.240 --> 18:36.400
get this, you throw a paper mache version of yourself in the ring.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.120
Interesting, that's some ninjitsu shit.

18:39.120 --> 18:39.680
Yeah, like.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.840
I wouldn't watch that training montage.

18:41.840 --> 18:44.080
Yeah, and they're already like attacking it

18:44.080 --> 18:48.080
and punching it and like they punch you in your solar plexus

18:48.080 --> 18:49.600
and they're like, that's a death blow.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.920
Their hand goes clean through you and then they come out

18:51.920 --> 18:53.280
and what do they have in their hand?

18:53.280 --> 18:56.400
A zag nut, you're full of candy, that's right.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.280
You've self pinataed and that is the safest thing you can do.

18:59.280 --> 19:00.800
Because you're just going to think about punching

19:00.800 --> 19:03.360
when they got a delicious zag nut to enjoy.

19:04.160 --> 19:08.000
What I love about that is that I think that movies like Karate Kid

19:08.000 --> 19:12.640
have taught us that the fastest way to win is not to fight, right?

19:12.640 --> 19:15.200
Absolutely, see why skip ahead.

19:15.200 --> 19:19.040
Right, so maybe that's what every MMA teacher is waiting for,

19:19.040 --> 19:21.200
to have one student who's like, no, you know what?

19:22.000 --> 19:25.680
No, and then everybody just raises them up on their shoulder,

19:25.680 --> 19:27.760
gives them like three black belts,

19:27.760 --> 19:29.680
and like just dances them around the place

19:29.680 --> 19:32.960
because like they're the only people who have figured out MMA.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.880
They're just waiting for like Chuck Liddell to be like,

19:34.880 --> 19:37.120
you know what, I don't want to punch anymore.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.520
And everyone's like, you're the hero now.

19:39.520 --> 19:40.960
You've taught us a valuable lesson.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.640
MMA is canceled, everybody.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.560
No more MMA.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.200
You know what I would do?

19:45.200 --> 19:47.280
They solved it, why are we even doing this?

19:47.280 --> 19:51.760
I would do like in the Sherlock Holmes movie with Robert Donnie Jr.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.560
And I would do that thing where like I see them like-

19:54.560 --> 19:56.400
Do you mean the only good Sherlock Holmes?

19:57.680 --> 20:02.480
I see the man who I'm fighting start to twist back and he's shirtless.

20:03.040 --> 20:03.760
Should I slow down?

20:04.400 --> 20:06.400
And he's shirtless and he's twisting backwards,

20:06.400 --> 20:08.800
like give me a good old haymaker.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.040
And I'm looking at his muscles inside his body

20:11.040 --> 20:12.400
and he's moving in slow motion.

20:12.400 --> 20:16.320
And like this like user interface sort of appears over him.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.800
And it's like weak left ribs,

20:20.880 --> 20:23.520
punch impact coming in two seconds,

20:25.680 --> 20:28.000
blind spot in right eye.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.320
And I'm like fucking analyzing all of his data

20:30.320 --> 20:32.880
and his weak points and shit and like checking out his HP.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.920
And then like once I've fully scanned him like that,

20:35.920 --> 20:40.400
I can dodge all his blows and punch him where it would hurt his body the most.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.280
It just occurred to me that like Sherlock Holmes,

20:43.280 --> 20:46.160
Robert Donnie Sherlock Holmes basically just has Jarvis again.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.640
He loved having a computer in his head so much.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.480
He's like, let's do it again, guys.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.920
Hey guys, listen to me.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.800
RDJ, listen, I was thinking could you have a robot in my head again?

20:54.800 --> 20:57.200
Wouldn't it be great if that scene played out with him analyzing

20:57.200 --> 20:59.520
although this is while he was getting punched.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.240
Yeah, that would probably be more.

21:00.240 --> 21:03.120
As the guy's punching him, he's like weak left eye.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.840
Poof, limp on the left leg.

21:05.840 --> 21:13.120
Travis, I was just in the pupil state of a note perfect Robert Donnie Jr.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.000
Yeah, you really crunched it.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.200
History will never forgive you for not letting that blossom

21:20.320 --> 21:24.720
emerge from its chrysalis into the world's most perfect Robert Donnie Jr. impression.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.720
Do you wanna, is it too late to take a second stab?

21:26.720 --> 21:28.560
It's gone, baby, it's gone.

21:29.360 --> 21:32.400
I should clarify, I also liked the young Sherlock Holmes

21:32.400 --> 21:34.000
where there was like the fear toxin

21:34.000 --> 21:36.880
and there was a part where like the buns came to life

21:36.880 --> 21:39.200
and like all the sweets were attacking.

21:39.200 --> 21:47.520
I don't think I have the fighting prowess required to slow motion scan my enemies.

21:48.880 --> 21:53.040
But could I make them think that I was to scare them away from me?

21:53.600 --> 21:54.880
Like that would be my self-defense.

21:54.880 --> 21:58.160
Like if I see somebody coming for me with a big old barrel of punches

21:58.160 --> 22:01.520
that they're about to upend on me, then I can look at them and be like,

22:01.520 --> 22:11.280
scanning left eye Lopez, right ribs, former broke left wrist in 1996.

22:12.080 --> 22:15.920
Weak left wrist, legs are soft, soft legs.

22:15.920 --> 22:20.960
Maybe just like undiagnosed appendicitis, one punch could kill.

22:20.960 --> 22:21.440
Oh yeah.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm out.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.920
That would be good, loose brain.

22:23.920 --> 22:28.480
Or what if you went psychological, Griffin, and analyzed them psychologically

22:28.480 --> 22:30.800
and you're just like friends and family never loved them

22:30.800 --> 22:36.160
and you just like were instead like throwing out kind of more psychological barbs.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.440
Dad is a time traveler, doesn't, isn't home very much.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.440
That's right, my dad is a time traveler.

22:48.480 --> 22:51.440
At least that's what he tells me when he goes for business trips.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.560
How about another question?

22:54.560 --> 22:57.920
What if you just decided to like, you know about cosplaying,

22:57.920 --> 23:01.280
what if you like cos-fighted, what if you said like, listen, Iron Man,

23:01.280 --> 23:04.400
like you got in the ring, got his head, like, hey, listen, Iron Man,

23:04.400 --> 23:07.680
I'm not gonna fight you, I'm your best friend Captain America, we can't do this.

23:07.680 --> 23:08.000
Yeah.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I think that'd be hugely distracting.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.240
That would be, it's me, red boy.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.840
Well, fuck, I can't punch red boy.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.240
I'm not gonna punch red boy, we're fast friends.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.880
On my way to work, I stop at a coffee shop.

23:18.880 --> 23:23.760
There is a barista there who, whether he is working or just hanging out on his off hours,

23:23.760 --> 23:28.000
stares at me like he wants to murder me and wear my skin every single day.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.360
It's majorly creepy and unsettling and not a great start to my day.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.240
What do I do?

23:32.240 --> 23:33.120
Do I ignore it?

23:33.120 --> 23:35.680
Do I go to a different coffee place that's not as convenient?

23:35.680 --> 23:39.600
Do I tell a manager, even though I'd feel bad if it got him fired?

23:40.320 --> 23:41.840
Creepers need jobs too?

23:41.840 --> 23:43.520
And that's from Coffee Conundrum.

23:44.320 --> 23:50.800
There's a sandwich shop very close to me that has some boys in it

23:50.800 --> 23:53.760
that made me feel uncomfortable, not in like a danger place,

23:53.760 --> 23:58.880
but just like they don't respect this sort of social cues

23:58.880 --> 24:02.400
that me or anybody else in line at this place puts out.

24:02.960 --> 24:08.160
And so we have just stopped going to that sandwich place,

24:08.160 --> 24:09.360
going to a different sandwich place.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.440
Can you give me a little more, a little more color?

24:12.080 --> 24:12.880
Like, what are you saying?

24:12.880 --> 24:15.520
Yeah, that could be anywhere from like-

24:15.520 --> 24:16.240
All right, all right, all right, all right.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.680
Like, giggling at you.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.360
Yeah, okay, let's just role play.

24:19.360 --> 24:20.960
Justin, you're mean.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.920
And I really want you to sort of take your own sort of social needs

24:23.920 --> 24:27.040
and desires into, hey man, how's your weekend?

24:28.160 --> 24:29.760
Wait, so I'm you?

24:29.760 --> 24:30.080
Yes.

24:30.640 --> 24:31.280
Okay.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.600
I'd like a pepperoni sandwich, please.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.400
Oh, cool, man.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.680
I'll whip that up for you.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.920
And then I'm gonna sing like a little song while I do it,

24:37.920 --> 24:40.800
like literally sing a song, like literally sing a song.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.280
And I'm gonna look up at you and be like, so how was your weekend?

24:45.200 --> 24:46.560
How's the sandwich coming?

24:46.560 --> 24:47.920
It was fine, it was fine.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.160
So this isn't gonna work, is it, this role play session?

24:51.200 --> 24:52.080
Let me try, let me try.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.600
Let's recast it, okay.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.120
I'm just, I liked Justin better

24:55.120 --> 24:58.720
because I know that his like social stuff's not as good as yours.

24:58.720 --> 24:59.200
I got you.

24:59.200 --> 24:59.700
Okay.

25:01.360 --> 25:02.560
Hey man, how was your weekend?

25:03.360 --> 25:04.160
Pokemon!

25:04.160 --> 25:05.200
All right, fuck you guys.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.640
It sounds like they have a joyful heart,

25:16.640 --> 25:19.920
like they're approaching the world in their work with a joyful heart

25:19.920 --> 25:21.760
and that's what's making you so uncomfortable.

25:24.160 --> 25:26.400
No, it's not, it's bad, it's bad.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.360
Cause I like that shit.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.440
I'm usually into like having a conversation.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.120
I love having a conversation with a person.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.200
It's just different, there's a funk to it.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.240
There's a funk to it.

25:35.840 --> 25:38.640
It's like a judgment funk, like you're gonna say the wrong thing.

25:38.640 --> 25:39.440
A bit of a judge.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.360
I've gotten that at a coffee shop before

25:41.360 --> 25:44.720
where the dude or lady or person was very cool.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.000
Just very, yeah.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.480
And I knew like, I knew that if I was just like,

25:48.480 --> 25:52.640
I would just like, there's, especially here in Los Angeles

25:52.640 --> 25:55.360
where like I just want a cup of like drip coffee

25:55.360 --> 25:58.880
and then they like artisanally like pour hot water

25:58.880 --> 26:03.040
over a single cup brew into a glass pitcher

26:03.040 --> 26:06.000
and the whole time they're just like staring at me as they do it

26:06.000 --> 26:07.280
as though I'm supposed to be impressed

26:07.280 --> 26:09.440
that they can pour water over coffee

26:09.440 --> 26:12.480
and then they hand me the coffee and I'm like, okay, cool.

26:12.480 --> 26:15.120
And that's $6, great, thank you so much.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.800
In one transaction with these two boys,

26:16.800 --> 26:20.400
one of them quoted Monty Python at me twice.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.800
That's where we're at.

26:24.000 --> 26:24.880
That's rough.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.720
That shouldn't be weaponized.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.800
It's been aerosolized and it was sprayed in my fucking face

26:31.680 --> 26:34.000
and into my nose and mouth and in my breath system.

26:36.160 --> 26:40.320
Okay, I feel like if you wanna keep talking to this,

26:40.320 --> 26:41.760
going to this store, you have to talk to this person.

26:41.760 --> 26:44.160
If you wanna keep dating this Starbucks.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.240
If you wanna keep in this committed relationship

26:46.240 --> 26:47.600
with your local Starbucks,

26:48.240 --> 26:49.840
you need to talk to this person

26:49.840 --> 26:51.680
and ask them what their fucking story is.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.120
That would shut it down, right?

26:53.120 --> 26:57.840
Like, I mean, the problem is it is impossible for us

26:57.840 --> 27:02.720
to calculate whether or not some sort of like flirtation

27:02.720 --> 27:05.600
or sexual attraction is like figuring into this.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.480
Like, is this someone who's very bad at,

27:08.480 --> 27:11.360
like who has read the game one too many times

27:11.360 --> 27:13.760
and thinks that like consistent eye contact

27:13.760 --> 27:14.320
is hugely important.

27:14.320 --> 27:15.440
Is that a Grisham novel?

27:16.960 --> 27:20.640
Yeah, it's a movie where, I think it's Michael Douglas.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.000
Yeah.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.200
He like is in a big game.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.920
Where they just nag on each other.

27:27.920 --> 27:30.400
They just nag each other back and forth and back and forth

27:30.400 --> 27:31.760
and at the end he gets thrown off a building.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.080
I think the key to making that work, Justin,

27:34.080 --> 27:35.120
because I think you're right.

27:35.120 --> 27:38.720
I think you have to find a window of like,

27:38.720 --> 27:41.520
so they're doing something that you can count,

27:41.520 --> 27:43.840
not like maybe they're reading a paper

27:43.840 --> 27:46.560
or like it's something that you can comment on

27:46.560 --> 27:48.640
rather than just walking up to them and going,

27:48.640 --> 27:51.040
hello, I'm Steven or you know what I mean?

27:51.040 --> 27:52.880
Like you need some,

27:52.880 --> 27:55.440
because if they respond like, yeah, go fuck yourself,

27:55.440 --> 27:56.640
then you're like, oh, cool.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.720
I get exactly what's going on now.

28:00.160 --> 28:02.480
But if they do read the situation

28:02.480 --> 28:05.280
is whatever interaction you try to have with them,

28:05.280 --> 28:06.480
you are flirting with them.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.000
And as far as they're concerned, it's on,

28:08.000 --> 28:09.680
you do need to pull out

28:09.680 --> 28:12.720
and go to a different coffee shop from now on.

28:12.720 --> 28:13.560
That coffee shop is-

28:13.560 --> 28:14.400
I'd say fuck that.

28:14.400 --> 28:15.600
Don't even give them a fucking chance.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.760
It is a consumer facing business

28:17.760 --> 28:20.560
and you're uncomfortable with the treatment

28:20.560 --> 28:22.640
of the consumers and that's all that matters.

28:22.640 --> 28:24.800
Baby buck stops here, customer's always right.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.200
Consumer's always right.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.040
Just fucking-

28:27.040 --> 28:27.860
So do you complain, Griffin?

28:27.860 --> 28:28.700
No, you fucking bounce.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.280
You go somewhere else and give them their dollars

28:30.280 --> 28:31.280
and maybe somebody will,

28:31.280 --> 28:34.120
just all I need is just a coffee and a banana

28:34.120 --> 28:35.240
and a have a nice day.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.840
That's all I need, coffee, check.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.800
Banana, check.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.520
Go fuck yourself, not a check.

28:39.520 --> 28:41.000
I'm gonna go somewhere else.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.040
I actually wouldn't mind

28:42.040 --> 28:44.200
if I was buying coffee and a banana

28:44.200 --> 28:46.200
and then I handed them the money and they said,

28:46.200 --> 28:47.800
okay, thanks, go fuck yourself.

28:47.800 --> 28:50.960
I actually would be okay with that as an interaction.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.680
Okay, so sort of Dick's last cafe.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.440
Yeah, I would know exactly where I stood

28:55.440 --> 28:56.600
with that coffee shop.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.440
Excuse me, fellas.

28:59.440 --> 29:01.080
I needed to take a quick sidebar

29:01.080 --> 29:02.520
to talk about the pickup artist.

29:02.520 --> 29:03.360
Oh, Jesus.

29:03.360 --> 29:07.200
I think the greatest injustice in human history

29:07.200 --> 29:09.360
is that we were not producing the show

29:09.360 --> 29:11.800
at the same time in synchronicity

29:11.800 --> 29:13.520
with a hit series called The Pickup Artist.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.840
We would have known that it was about

29:14.840 --> 29:17.080
to like ruin fucking everything, right?

29:17.080 --> 29:19.000
Just the worst thing.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.800
Then on this show, if you missed it,

29:20.800 --> 29:23.040
started a guy literally named Mystery

29:23.040 --> 29:25.240
who wore a hat that he definitely wore.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.320
And if you can look up a picture of Mystery's hat,

29:27.320 --> 29:29.840
you'll very much appreciate what a commitment that is

29:29.840 --> 29:30.920
to his whole stage.

29:30.920 --> 29:33.840
Mystery spelled in the traditional spelling of the name

29:33.840 --> 29:35.800
or like Mr. E.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.200
No, it's just Mystery.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.280
And his real name is Eric Von Markovic.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.120
Oh, right.

29:42.120 --> 29:42.960
Yeah.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.440
All right.

29:44.440 --> 29:45.640
Just super quick.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.000
There were, it looks like eight contestants

29:49.000 --> 29:50.600
in the first season of The Pickup Artist

29:50.600 --> 29:54.600
where he tried to teach these fellas how to score bibs.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.040
And I'm just gonna read you their status.

29:56.040 --> 29:57.360
They were fighting for bibs?

29:57.360 --> 29:58.200
Like that you put bibs?

29:58.200 --> 30:00.280
They get prodigious bibs.

30:00.280 --> 30:01.240
Super quick.

30:01.240 --> 30:03.200
I'm gonna tell you the stat.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.080
I'm not gonna tell you their names

30:04.080 --> 30:05.160
because who gives a shit.

30:05.160 --> 30:07.080
I wanna tell you the reasons that they're on the show.

30:07.080 --> 30:07.920
Eight quick reasons.

30:07.920 --> 30:08.760
Here we go.

30:08.760 --> 30:11.200
Number one, freezes up around women.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.160
Brady, lacking in self-confidence.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.480
You just said you weren't gonna say their names.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.520
I changed my mind.

30:15.520 --> 30:19.160
Jody, the quote friend to girls.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.720
Jody, friend to all girls.

30:20.720 --> 30:21.560
Pradeep.

30:21.560 --> 30:22.380
Oh, Jody?

30:22.380 --> 30:23.220
Oh, nice, yeah.

30:23.220 --> 30:24.880
We're gonna go have a picnic tomorrow

30:24.880 --> 30:25.840
and it's gonna be great.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.760
Oh, I have a picnic plan with Jody.

30:27.760 --> 30:29.800
He's every girl's friend.

30:29.800 --> 30:32.280
Pradeep over analyzes and talks too much.

30:32.280 --> 30:35.480
Joe W. starts off strong but often fails fast.

30:35.480 --> 30:38.680
Scott gets very nervous and stutters around women.

30:38.680 --> 30:42.120
Fred, 40-year-old virgin plus five.

30:42.120 --> 30:42.960
He's 45.

30:42.960 --> 30:47.200
And then lastly, there's Steven Poon or Spoon

30:47.200 --> 30:48.960
who does not know how to approach women.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.400
He was eliminated first.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.240
Hi, I'm Spoon.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.260
Wait, you get eliminated from this game?

30:53.260 --> 30:54.920
You get eliminated from the game.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.680
You'll never talk to women.

30:56.680 --> 30:57.520
Get out of here.

30:57.520 --> 30:58.760
You'll never be able to talk to women.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.460
I feel like we all got eliminated from this game

31:00.460 --> 31:01.440
because even if you miss,

31:01.440 --> 31:03.280
I never watch the pickup artists,

31:03.280 --> 31:05.520
but I feel like on a daily basis,

31:05.520 --> 31:08.920
I experienced the ripples, the shockwaves

31:08.920 --> 31:11.520
that it sent out across our cultural landscape.

31:11.520 --> 31:14.480
I'm so sad we weren't, we missed.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.320
The reception on Wikipedia,

31:16.320 --> 31:18.880
the initial viewer ratings were disappointing.

31:18.880 --> 31:21.720
Debuting with only 672,000 viewers.

31:21.720 --> 31:22.720
That depends on who you are.

31:22.720 --> 31:24.840
Because to me, nobody watches this fucking show.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.640
That does not disappoint me.

31:26.640 --> 31:28.960
No, that actually makes me feel pretty good.

31:28.960 --> 31:31.700
That appoints me a major way.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.040
Griffin is appointed now to a higher level.

31:35.040 --> 31:36.680
Fuck that show.

31:36.680 --> 31:37.520
Fuck everybody.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.400
Fuck all those guys.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.240
Fuck the show.

31:39.240 --> 31:40.060
Fuck mystery.

31:40.060 --> 31:41.880
That show was executive produced by J.D. Roth,

31:41.880 --> 31:44.000
who you'll remember as the Finder's Keepers.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.640
Maybe bring it back on the O network.

31:46.640 --> 31:50.860
Maybe on O and all women, gender-flipped pickup artists.

31:50.860 --> 31:52.480
Just, oh, but that's the twist.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.360
It's like at the end, women are judges

31:54.360 --> 31:56.160
and they're just like, okay, behave.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.440
Nope, you did bad.

31:58.440 --> 31:59.600
Be a good human being.

31:59.600 --> 32:00.440
Oh, you failed.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.260
You messed up.

32:01.260 --> 32:02.640
No, no, no.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.000
Let's take a quick break and go to the Money Zone.

32:05.000 --> 32:05.820
I'm coming.

32:15.760 --> 32:16.960
My brother and my brother made a supporting part

32:16.960 --> 32:17.800
by Squarespace.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.080
Travis, what the hell is that?

32:19.080 --> 32:20.160
Squarespace?

32:20.160 --> 32:21.940
Yeah, what the fuck is that?

32:21.940 --> 32:23.600
You tried RoundSpace, right?

32:23.600 --> 32:24.420
Yeah.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.680
Yeah, and how RoundSpace makes really shitty,

32:26.680 --> 32:27.980
hard to make websites.

32:28.880 --> 32:32.500
Well, Squarespace makes easy, good websites.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.600
Why did they do that the first time around?

32:34.600 --> 32:37.160
Well, cause they weren't sure what should they were like,

32:37.160 --> 32:39.520
let's cut corners and they made round space.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.680
And then they say, you know what?

32:42.680 --> 32:44.160
Slap those corners back on there.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.120
That's where all the programming was.

32:46.120 --> 32:46.960
Yeah.

32:46.960 --> 32:47.920
And they glued the corners back on

32:47.920 --> 32:49.280
and they made square space, square space.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.240
Round space, by the way, round space is a,

32:52.400 --> 32:57.400
is a UK based professional training and coaching outfit.

32:57.440 --> 33:00.120
And you just really put them in the fucking trash.

33:00.120 --> 33:01.160
Didn't you?

33:01.160 --> 33:02.920
Well, or in the winter circle,

33:02.920 --> 33:04.280
you're welcome for the free mention.

33:04.280 --> 33:05.440
Back to Squarespace though.

33:05.440 --> 33:10.160
Squarespace is a host to the MacaroyShows.com website

33:10.160 --> 33:13.020
where you can find all of the Macaroy projects,

33:13.020 --> 33:15.840
including YouTube stuff and other podcasts.

33:15.840 --> 33:17.160
That's weird, this feels like a commercial for us.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.000
Commercial for us.

33:18.000 --> 33:18.980
Well, no, but hear me out.

33:18.980 --> 33:19.820
Good twist.

33:19.820 --> 33:23.500
Because I, when I started it, I envisioned like,

33:23.500 --> 33:24.960
well, this is going to be tough.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.920
So I'll just put a couple of links on there.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.240
And then as I was doing it,

33:28.240 --> 33:33.240
I realized how not only easy, but also like versatile it was.

33:33.240 --> 33:36.600
Like the things you're able to do with very, very,

33:36.600 --> 33:39.880
very little expertise and knowledge of what you're doing.

33:39.880 --> 33:43.320
And end up with a very professional looking website

33:43.320 --> 33:45.400
that people have asked me like, well, who did this?

33:45.400 --> 33:47.560
And it was like, I did it in about two hours

33:47.560 --> 33:51.180
and I'm able to jump in and make edits and improve things

33:51.180 --> 33:53.040
and add new stuff on a whim.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.160
And it's so fast and easy.

33:55.160 --> 33:58.300
And also I have, you know,

33:58.300 --> 34:00.200
had professional websites made before

34:00.200 --> 34:03.480
and as a cost effective option, Squarespace really,

34:03.480 --> 34:04.920
really delivers.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.020
I highly recommend it.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.200

34:17.200 --> 34:18.480
I really liked the website.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.020
I really liked the way this is looking.

34:20.020 --> 34:23.380
You pay to publish and trust me, you won't regret it.

34:23.380 --> 34:24.460
Squarespace.

34:24.460 --> 34:27.880
Nope, you should Squarespace.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.380
Squarespace, you should Squarespace.

34:30.380 --> 34:33.520
Get your Squarespace on your left now.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.320
I wanna tell y'all about Club W.

34:35.320 --> 34:37.240
It's an exclusive club by which I mean,

34:37.240 --> 34:39.680
you can get into it if you go to Club W

34:39.680 --> 34:41.720
and go to their website and sign up for it.

34:41.720 --> 34:44.560
But it is still, it's very exclusive

34:44.560 --> 34:46.960
because what does that W stand for?

34:46.960 --> 34:48.320
Weapons.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.160
What?

34:49.160 --> 34:51.000
They send you a new weapon every week.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.880
This week I got a big old club

34:52.880 --> 34:55.120
and it's got a gun in the handle of it.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.880
It's a gun club.

34:56.880 --> 34:58.720
It's not true.

34:58.720 --> 35:02.040
No, the W actually stands for Winslow.

35:02.040 --> 35:05.000
It is a club and we all get together every week

35:05.000 --> 35:08.280
and we talk about our favorite sort of Family Matters stuff.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.120
Just so you know.

35:09.120 --> 35:09.960
That's also not true.

35:09.960 --> 35:10.780
Not true.

35:10.780 --> 35:11.620
Tell the truth.

35:11.620 --> 35:14.240
Okay, Club W is an exclusive club

35:15.180 --> 35:16.220
where we talk about Family Matters.

35:16.220 --> 35:17.060
Guys, I can't.

35:17.060 --> 35:17.900
No, it's not.

35:17.900 --> 35:19.360
It's about wine.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.480
It is a wine club.

35:20.480 --> 35:21.320
It's a wine thing.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.560
You fucking know that.

35:22.560 --> 35:27.120
Club W, it allows you to sort of get past all of the stuff

35:27.120 --> 35:28.200
where you're shopping for wine

35:28.200 --> 35:29.680
and you don't know what any of the words

35:29.680 --> 35:32.000
or like flavor profiles mean

35:32.000 --> 35:34.320
and you just want some wine to have with your fish

35:34.320 --> 35:35.720
or your steak or whatever.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.800
But you want something good?

35:37.800 --> 35:38.960
Well, Club W's got your back.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.480
It's a revolutionary new wine club

35:40.480 --> 35:42.200
that sends wine directly to your door.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.960
Saves you all the trips to the grocery store,

35:43.960 --> 35:46.760
all the like being awkward, standing in the wine aisle,

35:46.760 --> 35:48.480
just like picking up bottles and looking at them

35:48.480 --> 35:51.040
and pretending to know what the fuck they're all about.

35:51.040 --> 35:54.160
Club W asks you a six question quiz

35:54.160 --> 35:55.780
and then it sort of determines what your palate is

35:55.780 --> 35:56.620
based on that quiz.

35:56.620 --> 35:58.120
So every bottle that you get

35:58.120 --> 36:00.400
is perfectly tailored to your tastes.

36:00.400 --> 36:01.480
It works directly with vineyards,

36:01.480 --> 36:03.560
cuts out the middlemen, saves you money

36:03.560 --> 36:04.860
and it's got a no risk guarantee

36:04.860 --> 36:08.660
that you will love drinking what they send you.

36:08.660 --> 36:11.000
Right now, Club W is offering listeners $20 off

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000

Here's a message to Emily Lloyd from Liam S. Smith

36:33.680 --> 36:36.480
and it reads, dear Emily, AKA Reagan,

36:36.480 --> 36:38.680
I hope this belated, you know it homie,

36:38.680 --> 36:40.560
birthday message fills you with delight

36:40.560 --> 36:43.360
and reminds you that you have peeps in your corner

36:43.360 --> 36:45.960
all the way across the sea.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.000
Happy birthday.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.640
I hope you and Patty keep killing it in the UK.

36:49.640 --> 36:52.400
Never forget, you are Emily Lloyd.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.640
Oh, that's so fucking fresh, isn't it?

36:54.640 --> 36:55.480
Wow.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.640
Never forget, you are Emily Lloyd.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.780
In all things, you are Emily Lloyd.

36:59.780 --> 37:02.160
You are constant as the Northern Star.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.800
That's so good that for a second there,

37:03.800 --> 37:05.400
I thought I was Emily Lloyd.

37:05.400 --> 37:06.560
No, she is Emily Lloyd.

37:06.560 --> 37:09.140
Today, we are all Emily Lloyd.

37:09.140 --> 37:11.220
Lots of love, your pal, Liam.

37:11.220 --> 37:13.300
You are Emily Lloyd.

37:13.300 --> 37:15.040
You are the best. And you are Emily Lloyd.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.480
And you are Emily Lloyd.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.800
And you, no, okay.

37:17.800 --> 37:21.560
No, you are the Northern Star, the Polaris

37:21.560 --> 37:23.920
around which all of us must navigate.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.400
You are Emily Lloyd.

37:25.400 --> 37:28.040
This is actually from your pal, Liam,

37:28.040 --> 37:30.160
and everyone else, but they didn't pay for this message.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.500
I like that, Liam.

37:31.500 --> 37:32.340
Fuck them.

37:32.340 --> 37:34.520
Yep, fuck them. Put up or shut up.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.360
Got another message here.

37:35.360 --> 37:39.040
This one's for Jer and Richie, and it's from Sian.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.160
Sian com.

37:41.160 --> 37:42.080
Sian.

37:42.080 --> 37:46.880
Sian by the chandelier singer.

37:46.880 --> 37:50.400
Jer and Richie's message is from Sian who says,

37:50.400 --> 37:52.120
this is what it would feel like

37:52.120 --> 37:54.140
if the brothers McRoy knew you existed.

37:54.140 --> 37:57.760
Please enjoy this fleeting moment of recognition.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.260
Yep.

37:59.260 --> 38:00.560
Can the three of us just sort of say

38:00.560 --> 38:02.560
our favorite thing about Jer and Richie?

38:04.240 --> 38:07.560
Their names sound really good when you say them together.

38:07.560 --> 38:08.520
They have a good mouth feel.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.920
Jer and Richie.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.160
I like the way that they're always together.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.820
Like you never just see Jer, you never just see Richie.

38:14.820 --> 38:17.040
It's a really pretty sweet package deal.

38:17.040 --> 38:20.280
Jer can jump really high,

38:20.280 --> 38:24.240
and Richie is gluten intolerant.

38:24.240 --> 38:25.080
Yeah.

38:25.080 --> 38:25.920
Which I like.

38:25.920 --> 38:26.740
Jer can jump really high.

38:26.740 --> 38:27.580
At least more bread for me.

38:27.580 --> 38:30.020
Jer can jump really high and Richie can duck really fast.

38:30.020 --> 38:31.280
It makes for a lot of really fun-

38:31.280 --> 38:32.120
Yeah, they do like-

38:32.120 --> 38:32.940
Antics and stunts.

38:32.940 --> 38:33.780
You're just like walking in the movie theater

38:33.780 --> 38:34.760
and then all of a sudden you look behind you

38:34.760 --> 38:38.040
and just whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

38:38.040 --> 38:39.280

38:47.120 --> 38:48.760
All sponsored by Grazex,

38:48.760 --> 38:51.360

39:01.000 --> 39:01.840
Beef out.

39:04.140 --> 39:05.520
Recently I helped a friend move.

39:05.520 --> 39:06.360
Can I- Working for-

39:06.360 --> 39:07.180
No.

39:07.180 --> 39:08.020
What?

39:08.020 --> 39:09.240
I just want to do a yahoo.

39:09.240 --> 39:10.520
Okay, go for it.

39:10.520 --> 39:11.440
Actually, I think I want to,

39:11.440 --> 39:12.900
somebody sent me a tweet.

39:12.900 --> 39:14.400
Okay, that's not really-

39:14.400 --> 39:15.240
Well, no, it's pretty,

39:15.240 --> 39:16.940
this tweet is pretty dark.

39:16.940 --> 39:18.200
I don't know if I should say the user or not.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.080
Let's talk about it first

39:19.080 --> 39:20.380
and we can say like,

39:20.380 --> 39:22.580
if we want to like mention the user's name.

39:22.580 --> 39:23.960
But it's a picture of,

39:23.960 --> 39:25.200
apparently it's very dark,

39:25.200 --> 39:26.160
but apparently it's a picture of them

39:26.160 --> 39:27.560
just like smoking a joint.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.380
And they said,

39:30.380 --> 39:31.360
Good Games, Inc.,

39:31.360 --> 39:33.520
which is almost the name of the video game podcast

39:33.520 --> 39:34.840
I do with Nick Robinson at Polygon.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.840
That's cool games, Inc.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.000
What I'm doing while listening to your podcast.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.080
Enjoying a jazz cigarette at home.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.400
And it's just like a picture of them like,

39:42.400 --> 39:43.840
having, having,

39:43.840 --> 39:45.340
smoking a Padoober.

39:45.340 --> 39:46.800
And then I sort of went through their account

39:46.800 --> 39:50.700
and that's exclusively this person's activities.

39:50.700 --> 39:51.640
Trends like these.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.480
What I'm doing while listening to your podcast.

39:53.480 --> 39:54.440
Getting some exercise.

39:54.440 --> 39:55.260
Playing some b-ball.

39:55.260 --> 39:56.100
And sure enough,

39:56.100 --> 39:58.240
here's a picture of a basketball court.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.600
Got one, Oh No Ross and Kerry.

39:59.600 --> 40:01.280
What I'm doing while listening to your podcast.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.760
Relaxing before picking up my wife from work.

40:03.760 --> 40:06.820
And this is just like a picture from a, a bed.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.380
Where somebody's lying down.

40:09.380 --> 40:10.240
That's so fresh.

40:10.240 --> 40:11.640
I'm like really very into it.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.400
It's, it's Francis Reed.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.760
Maybe, maybe they've only been doing this

40:15.760 --> 40:17.040
for about a month or so,

40:17.040 --> 40:18.000
but I'm into this.

40:18.000 --> 40:18.820
Well, first of all,

40:18.820 --> 40:20.480
I love when people send me a picture of them doing drugs.

40:20.480 --> 40:22.080
Cause I see that I'm like fucking cool.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.080
Yes.

40:23.080 --> 40:23.920
Yes.

40:23.920 --> 40:24.740
My people.

40:24.740 --> 40:26.540
I love drugs.

40:26.540 --> 40:27.380
Drugs.

40:27.380 --> 40:28.200
Top-notch.

40:28.200 --> 40:31.400
It's so important in, in there's just a flood

40:31.400 --> 40:34.200
of social media presences in the world.

40:34.200 --> 40:37.280
And so important to establish like what's your brand.

40:37.280 --> 40:40.120
You know, what's your, what's your thing.

40:40.120 --> 40:42.740
And if your thing is letting podcasts know

40:42.740 --> 40:44.800
what you're doing while you're listening to them.

40:44.800 --> 40:47.680
Guys, listen, if you ever are listening to us,

40:47.680 --> 40:49.360
make our jokes and you say,

40:49.360 --> 40:50.440
this seems like the kind of thing

40:50.440 --> 40:52.040
I would love to spark up to.

40:52.040 --> 40:52.880
Don't be afraid.

40:52.880 --> 40:53.880
We're not fucking cops.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.420
We will not knock you out.

40:55.420 --> 40:58.560
Send me those pics of you sparking one up to our jokes.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.240
And I want to be, I want to be clear.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.960
It doesn't have to just be that.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.000
If you're also like slamming a brew.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.120
I'm gonna go ahead and say it's explicitly

41:06.120 --> 41:07.960
sparking up a joint.

41:07.960 --> 41:11.000
I want pictures of people slamming brews.

41:11.000 --> 41:11.840
Okay.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.360
Francis hasn't limited himself to that.

41:13.360 --> 41:17.480
Francis, he tweeted at Julien Loves Music.

41:17.480 --> 41:19.380
What I'm doing while listening to your podcast,

41:19.380 --> 41:20.720
making tuna pasta bake.

41:20.720 --> 41:21.760
That's so great.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.760
Like that's such a great account.

41:23.760 --> 41:24.600
Here's what I'm gonna give.

41:24.600 --> 41:29.480
I'm gonna give the information, W-I-D-W-I-L-T-Y-P

41:29.480 --> 41:30.920
with an at before it.

41:30.920 --> 41:32.960
This is a fucking good account.

41:32.960 --> 41:35.080
If you see this person tweeting, please tweet at them.

41:35.080 --> 41:36.400
Like you're crushing it right now.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.240
Nice dude.

41:37.240 --> 41:38.080
Blazing up another drew.

41:38.080 --> 41:39.480
You know what I'm doing while listening to your podcast?

41:39.480 --> 41:40.920
Forging an ax.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.720
There's one where he's just forging an ax.

41:42.720 --> 41:44.400
Yeah, that's.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.800
Is it that different podcasts

41:45.800 --> 41:47.400
inspire him to do different things?

41:47.400 --> 41:49.880
Or is he just like relegated that like,

41:49.880 --> 41:54.800
I only listen to Hello from the Magic Tavern

41:54.800 --> 41:56.480
while I forge an ax?

41:56.480 --> 42:00.040
Let's do a Yahoo.

42:00.040 --> 42:01.520
This one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

42:01.520 --> 42:02.360
Thank you, Morgan.

42:02.360 --> 42:04.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

42:04.960 --> 42:06.840
Following this person right now.

42:06.840 --> 42:10.240
U2K, at U2K, heart heart.

42:10.240 --> 42:15.240
Who says, who believes Bruce Willis is a Yahoo user?

42:18.160 --> 42:22.200
I accidental found a Bruce Willis user account

42:22.200 --> 42:26.680
and I fan boxed that user's, what?

42:26.680 --> 42:27.520
What?

42:27.520 --> 42:28.560
Is that like shadow boxing?

42:28.560 --> 42:30.440
And I fan boxed that user's

42:30.440 --> 42:33.920
and also asked him a few Q if he really is.

42:33.920 --> 42:38.920
Then he knows my husband and can answer those four Q.

42:39.520 --> 42:42.600
Over 3000 idiots answered that user's Q

42:42.600 --> 42:45.400
and many stared it, et cetera.

42:45.400 --> 42:46.920
How stupid are people?

42:46.920 --> 42:50.320
Can anyone in Yahoo verify that it's him?

42:50.320 --> 42:51.920
I just called that user out.

42:51.920 --> 42:56.400
I call him, I call him a lair.

42:56.400 --> 42:59.840
And if he could answer those four Q's, I'd know for real.

42:59.840 --> 43:02.880
Okay, okay, okay, okay, all right.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.840
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

43:04.840 --> 43:05.960
So it's basically like,

43:05.960 --> 43:07.840
tell me something only Bruce Willis would know?

43:07.840 --> 43:10.880
Okay, so I think just sort of reading,

43:10.880 --> 43:13.120
I think this may be written in,

43:13.120 --> 43:16.080
is there a different version of English

43:16.080 --> 43:20.360
that reads like Arabic

43:20.360 --> 43:21.800
where you're supposed to go right to left?

43:21.800 --> 43:22.680
Cause that's the only way

43:22.680 --> 43:25.600
that I can sort of piece this one together.

43:25.600 --> 43:27.640
Is there a part in this question

43:27.640 --> 43:31.080
where this person says their husband knows Bruce Willis?

43:31.080 --> 43:34.320
I think it says their hubby knows Bruno

43:34.320 --> 43:38.240
and I know things, he's relayed information to me

43:38.240 --> 43:40.800
that only the real Bruno would know.

43:40.800 --> 43:43.080
I don't want any fake Brunos in the mix.

43:43.080 --> 43:45.680
So this person asked questions maybe about,

43:45.680 --> 43:47.640
hey, if it's really you, Bruce,

43:47.640 --> 43:51.320
tell me what my husband's favorite animal is.

43:51.320 --> 43:52.540
You would know.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.680
Do you think Bruno uses Yahoo Answers?

43:57.680 --> 44:00.040
How else does he find stuff out?

44:00.040 --> 44:01.000
That is a good question.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.680
How do you learn stuff?

44:02.680 --> 44:04.400
Sometimes I like to think of like,

44:05.320 --> 44:08.800
I'm wishing on the same big bright stars Bruno,

44:08.800 --> 44:10.360
cause like I think about like he has to

44:10.360 --> 44:13.880
at least accidentally have stumbled onto Yahoo Answers

44:13.880 --> 44:14.840
at some point and just like,

44:14.840 --> 44:15.720
maybe it was the same time

44:15.720 --> 44:18.080
that I was having a session on Yahoo.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.440
We've passed 300.

44:19.440 --> 44:21.400
What if he's listening right now?

44:21.400 --> 44:23.080
What if he's listening to this going,

44:23.080 --> 44:25.720
I am a Yahoo user, I found it through your show.

44:25.720 --> 44:27.240
No, that's too much to ask.

44:27.240 --> 44:28.240
I would just be happy to know

44:28.240 --> 44:31.280
that we both use the same website at a certain point.

44:31.280 --> 44:32.860
You probably both use Google.

44:33.800 --> 44:37.400
What do you think is a better album title?

44:37.400 --> 44:40.700
Bruce Willis' The Return of Bruno

44:40.700 --> 44:43.700
or Aerosmith's Hunkin' on Bobo?

44:43.700 --> 44:47.720
Between those two, which is the better album title?

44:47.720 --> 44:52.720
Bruno, if we could somehow do like a gray album mashup

44:52.800 --> 44:56.240
of the two, Hunkin' on Bruno.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.800
Hunkin' on Bruno, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:58.800 --> 45:00.560
And thank you Justin for that mind voyage

45:00.560 --> 45:02.760
that just discovered the name of episode 302

45:02.760 --> 45:04.200
of My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

45:04.200 --> 45:05.040
Yeah.

45:05.040 --> 45:05.860
Yeah.

45:05.860 --> 45:06.700
Yeah.

45:06.700 --> 45:10.200
A lot of harmonica work by Steven Tyler

45:10.200 --> 45:11.280
on Hunkin' on Bobo.

45:11.280 --> 45:12.120
Yeah.

45:12.120 --> 45:13.440
And I know you might be thinking,

45:13.440 --> 45:16.480
where did you get that fucking crazy name?

45:16.480 --> 45:18.260
Joe Perry stated in a radio interview,

45:18.260 --> 45:22.460
we just know that it's a phrase that sounds jazzy,

45:22.460 --> 45:26.680
jazzy-ish, nasty-ish, so it works for us.

45:26.680 --> 45:27.520
It is nasty.

45:27.520 --> 45:28.360
I wouldn't say it was nasty-ish.

45:28.360 --> 45:31.300
I would just say, remove the ish from that.

45:31.300 --> 45:33.040
It's just plain nasty.

45:33.040 --> 45:35.840
It's a nasty name when you're a nasty boy.

45:35.840 --> 45:36.680
Nasty Joe Perry.

45:36.680 --> 45:38.520
This is a fun sort of thought experiment,

45:38.520 --> 45:40.280
a thought spearmint.

45:40.280 --> 45:44.160
Think of a sex act that could not be described

45:44.160 --> 45:46.720
as Hunkin' on Bobo.

45:46.720 --> 45:49.360
Now write it down on a piece of paper

45:49.360 --> 45:51.480
and mail it to P.O. Box.

45:51.480 --> 45:53.600
Butt stuff?

45:53.600 --> 45:54.440
No?

45:54.440 --> 45:55.260
No.

45:55.260 --> 45:56.680
It's like the universal sex solvent.

45:56.680 --> 45:59.720
Like everything can fit into Hunkin' on Bobo.

45:59.720 --> 46:00.560
A Billy job?

46:00.560 --> 46:03.360
I think that might be the actual definition

46:03.360 --> 46:04.680
of Hunkin' on Bobo.

46:05.800 --> 46:07.560
Yeah, all of them.

46:07.560 --> 46:08.480
All of them.

46:08.480 --> 46:12.680
Just like really effin' the S out of a clown

46:12.680 --> 46:14.000
that's a little on the nose.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.480
And it would be on the nose.

46:16.520 --> 46:21.040
The Return of Bruno was an album released by Bruce Willis.

46:21.040 --> 46:23.560
If It Don't Kill You, It Just Makes You Stronger

46:23.560 --> 46:24.640
is an album by Bruce Willis.

46:24.640 --> 46:25.460
Excellent.

46:25.460 --> 46:28.480
And his third album, released in 1999, is-

46:28.480 --> 46:30.780
1999, 1999?

46:30.780 --> 46:33.280
Well, it's classic Bruce Willis.

46:33.280 --> 46:36.240
So they've apparently taken some of the biggest hits

46:36.240 --> 46:38.480
from his first two albums

46:38.480 --> 46:41.240
and turned it into sort of a greatest hits

46:41.240 --> 46:43.400
called classic Bruce Willis.

46:43.400 --> 46:45.840
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

46:45.840 --> 46:50.140
Did he name his first album Return of Bruno?

46:51.320 --> 46:52.400
Yes, Travis.

46:52.400 --> 46:54.080
He did do this thing you said.

46:54.080 --> 46:54.920
Now, was this a-

46:54.920 --> 46:55.760
Was this a-

46:55.760 --> 46:58.560
He put return in his first album?

46:58.560 --> 46:59.400
Now- Yes.

46:59.400 --> 47:01.320
Can I just real quick, can we establish,

47:01.320 --> 47:04.600
was it a Chris Gaines fugue state?

47:04.600 --> 47:05.840
Or was this the same,

47:05.840 --> 47:08.320
this is a Bruce Willis you know and love,

47:08.320 --> 47:10.880
only this time he's doing something a little bit different,

47:10.880 --> 47:14.160
which is to say he's honking on Bobo.

47:14.160 --> 47:16.940
No, it was a tie-in with Hudson Hawk.

47:17.880 --> 47:18.720
It is-

47:18.720 --> 47:20.200
Okay, so the Return of Bruno-

47:20.200 --> 47:21.560
Oh boy, we're really getting into it now.

47:21.560 --> 47:22.680
You gotta go deep,

47:22.680 --> 47:24.240
cause like I've been obsessed with the name of this album

47:24.240 --> 47:25.080
forever.

47:25.080 --> 47:30.080
Apparently there was also a one hour atrio special.

47:30.100 --> 47:32.320
It is a mockumentary starring Bruce Willis

47:32.320 --> 47:36.760
as his fictitious alter ego, Bruno Radolini.

47:36.760 --> 47:39.200
It was indeed a Chris Gaines fugue state.

47:39.200 --> 47:40.680
Oh shit.

47:40.680 --> 47:41.880
Yeah.

47:41.880 --> 47:42.720
Yeah.

47:43.640 --> 47:44.480
Yeah.

47:44.480 --> 47:45.300
What the fuck?

47:45.300 --> 47:46.140
Fuck, dude.

47:47.400 --> 47:51.600
You know that this motherfucker covered Secret Agent Man?

47:51.600 --> 47:54.320
Yeah, I can't, I literally can't.

47:54.320 --> 47:56.680
I'm looking at my copy of Surrogates right now

47:56.680 --> 47:58.320
and I'm weeping and we need to move on

47:58.320 --> 48:00.240
cause it's starting to hurt.

48:00.240 --> 48:02.400
Izzy Aya, who answers user.

48:02.400 --> 48:03.760
Has he ever said-

48:03.760 --> 48:05.320
I would have said no before.

48:05.320 --> 48:06.140
Yeah.

48:06.140 --> 48:06.980
I'm starting to feel very confident-

48:06.980 --> 48:09.200
He might not be, but Bruno might be.

48:09.200 --> 48:11.480
Maybe Bruno, oh man, no, I don't use it,

48:11.480 --> 48:13.360
but Bruno, he loves it.

48:13.360 --> 48:14.200
What?

48:14.200 --> 48:15.400
He won't shut up about it.

48:15.400 --> 48:16.320
Won't shut up about it.

48:16.320 --> 48:17.880
I don't even know how to use a computer.

48:17.880 --> 48:18.720
It's a computer, Bruce.

48:18.720 --> 48:20.720
It's a computer, it's pronounced computer.

48:22.060 --> 48:26.360
I'm just looking at on Yahoo.

48:26.360 --> 48:27.360
Oh, what'd you find?

48:29.360 --> 48:32.000
I've been, it's just a fucking look

48:32.000 --> 48:34.560
on he's giving on this album cover.

48:34.560 --> 48:35.400
No, it's very good.

48:35.400 --> 48:38.560
It's like, oh yeah, it's me, Brucey boy.

48:38.560 --> 48:41.040
And I'm here to sing you some tunes.

48:41.040 --> 48:42.940
It's me, I'm back, I'm Bruno.

48:45.320 --> 48:49.560
It should be like, it's a Bruce Willis solo album.

48:49.560 --> 48:52.040
The only acceptable look is like penance.

48:52.040 --> 48:53.300
Like, I'm sorry.

48:53.300 --> 48:55.920
I know you bought this cause you enjoy my acting.

48:55.920 --> 48:58.780
Do you like the song, Secret Agent Man?

48:58.780 --> 49:01.040
I'm just like, I did a quick Yahoo search

49:01.040 --> 49:03.980
for Bruce Willis, Bruno on Yahoo Answers.

49:03.980 --> 49:06.400
Found this one is by Yahoo Answers user.

49:06.400 --> 49:07.580
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

49:07.580 --> 49:09.160
Is Bruce Willis a good singer?

49:09.160 --> 49:11.280
Do you remember the return of Bruno in the 90s?

49:11.280 --> 49:12.520
Do you remember the cover version

49:12.520 --> 49:13.980
of Under the Boardwalk he did?

49:13.980 --> 49:17.600
So this could ostensibly be Bruno asking the question.

49:18.940 --> 49:21.440
Somebody says, I am sure he's a good of a singer

49:21.440 --> 49:23.680
as he is a Yahoo Answers user, lol.

49:23.680 --> 49:25.440
So this is eight years ago.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.300
Starting to think there may be a little bit of credibility.

49:27.300 --> 49:30.600
Somebody says, yes, a good bedroom singer.

49:30.600 --> 49:31.620
The fuck, dude.

49:31.620 --> 49:32.460
What?

49:32.460 --> 49:33.300
What does that mean?

49:33.300 --> 49:35.460
He's thirsty for that bobo.

49:35.460 --> 49:38.700
When he's hungry for that bobo,

49:38.700 --> 49:41.900
he's really going to town lyrically.

49:41.900 --> 49:43.660
His cover of Under the Boardwalk

49:43.660 --> 49:47.460
was a number two massive smash in the UK.

49:47.460 --> 49:51.100
Hey, are you okay right now?

49:51.100 --> 49:52.460
Are you doing all right?

49:52.460 --> 49:55.580
Seems like you made Bruce Willis a big singing sensation

49:55.580 --> 49:59.100
over there with this cover of 150 year old song.

49:59.100 --> 50:02.140
In episode, I just Googled Yahoo Answers Bruce Willis.

50:02.140 --> 50:03.460
We are one of the top results

50:03.460 --> 50:06.580
because apparently in episode 74 of My Brother, My Brother, Me,

50:06.580 --> 50:07.740
we address the question,

50:07.740 --> 50:11.100
how can I overcome my fear of Bruce Willis?

50:11.100 --> 50:16.100
Do you want to read a question, Justin?

50:16.460 --> 50:17.300
Yeah, I'd love that.

50:17.300 --> 50:18.620
Recently, I helped a friend move

50:18.620 --> 50:20.920
working for about six hours for no compensation

50:20.920 --> 50:23.460
other than a promised dinner that never came.

50:23.460 --> 50:25.180
While humping carry a TV downstairs,

50:25.180 --> 50:26.860
I tripped over a hole in the sidewalk

50:26.860 --> 50:28.400
and hit the TV into the ground.

50:28.400 --> 50:30.180
It looked fine till I plugged it in

50:30.180 --> 50:33.900
when we saw what looked like green ooze.

50:33.900 --> 50:35.580
It's turning into a Goosebumps book.

50:35.580 --> 50:38.220
When I saw what looked like green ooze

50:38.220 --> 50:39.060
dripping down the picture.

50:39.060 --> 50:40.660
I just imagined the cover

50:40.660 --> 50:42.740
and it's two boys sitting on a couch

50:42.740 --> 50:44.660
while a green ooze comes out of a TV

50:44.660 --> 50:47.060
and then underneath it and that Goosebumps font,

50:47.060 --> 50:49.100
it just says, I fucked up.

50:49.100 --> 50:52.660
And that's the name of the cover.

50:52.660 --> 50:55.100
Sorry, Derek, my R.L. Stine.

50:55.100 --> 50:56.100
Aw, fuck, Derek.

50:56.100 --> 50:59.060
I really goobered it up this time, bud.

50:59.060 --> 51:01.180
I goosed your bums, I'm sorry, Derek.

51:01.180 --> 51:04.140
Why is there a green goo in the TV?

51:04.140 --> 51:04.980
Okay.

51:04.980 --> 51:07.700
Slime time, colon, I done fucked up, Derek.

51:07.700 --> 51:12.940
Okay, it looked fine till I plugged it in

51:12.940 --> 51:14.020
when we saw what looked like green ooze

51:14.020 --> 51:15.380
dripping down the picture on the top right.

51:15.380 --> 51:17.140
What do I owe my friend?

51:17.140 --> 51:20.500
I offered my slightly smaller TV, a 45 inch,

51:20.500 --> 51:22.180
to replace the 50 inch I damaged,

51:22.180 --> 51:24.840
but he wants to replace it with a new one.

51:24.840 --> 51:28.380
How much should I contribute to a $450 replacement

51:28.380 --> 51:30.780
for a mistake I made while helping for free?

51:30.780 --> 51:32.580
That's from Alex Martin.

51:32.580 --> 51:35.460
I'm gonna say none, none dollars.

51:35.460 --> 51:36.780
None dollars, right?

51:36.780 --> 51:38.900
Like if he had wanted somebody who wouldn't break his shit,

51:38.900 --> 51:40.780
he should have hired a professional.

51:40.780 --> 51:43.660
It's kind of the risk of like moving.

51:43.660 --> 51:45.720
Yeah, when you roll up to help a friend move,

51:45.720 --> 51:47.420
you're like, hey, so do you want

51:47.420 --> 51:50.140
the $50 Derek insurance plan?

51:50.140 --> 51:51.940
So if I break any, you give me $50,

51:51.940 --> 51:53.380
if I break any of your shit, over, please.

51:53.380 --> 51:55.220
That's not how any of that works.

51:55.220 --> 51:56.180
That's not how any of the,

51:56.180 --> 51:58.500
like you've carried a TV in your life, what?

51:58.500 --> 52:00.420
Like maybe 10 times?

52:00.420 --> 52:01.840
Like I'll tell you this,

52:01.840 --> 52:04.900
it's a damn sight short of like 10,000 hours.

52:04.900 --> 52:06.700
You need to be an expert TV carrier.

52:06.700 --> 52:09.060
They should have known better.

52:09.060 --> 52:11.660
I would say that, especially if your friend,

52:11.660 --> 52:13.780
and it doesn't sound like from the question,

52:13.780 --> 52:16.060
isn't asking you to pay for it,

52:16.060 --> 52:18.780
I think that you don't have to feel any kind of guilt

52:18.780 --> 52:21.860
or over any kind of like remorse.

52:21.860 --> 52:23.660
But what happened, because you know, accidents happen.

52:23.660 --> 52:25.620
Now, if you had like gotten really mad

52:25.620 --> 52:27.020
because no pizza was delivered

52:27.020 --> 52:29.220
and you'd smash the TV on the ground,

52:29.220 --> 52:30.460
it's a different scenario.

52:30.460 --> 52:34.440
Yeah, and also the fact that he doesn't want to replace it

52:34.440 --> 52:38.260
with the 45 inch tells me this is just somebody

52:38.260 --> 52:40.220
who's got a hankering to buy a new TV.

52:40.220 --> 52:41.080
And it's pretty exciting.

52:41.080 --> 52:43.580
They might have put that green ooze on there themselves

52:43.580 --> 52:45.340
because it doesn't make a damn lick of sense otherwise.

52:45.340 --> 52:47.380
Oh, you think they, maybe they jellied up,

52:47.380 --> 52:49.540
maybe they jellied up the base

52:49.540 --> 52:51.060
before you started carrying it.

52:51.060 --> 52:54.120
And then slippy, slip, slip on that raspberry jam.

52:54.120 --> 52:54.960
Oops-a-daisies.

52:54.960 --> 52:56.820
Oops-a-daisies, well, that's on you, Derek.

52:56.820 --> 52:57.780
Here's the TV I want.

52:57.780 --> 52:59.840
I have a coupon for it right here in my pocket.

52:59.840 --> 53:01.260
Isn't that weird?

53:01.260 --> 53:04.060
I think you're gonna want to go with this 50 inch.

53:04.060 --> 53:05.660
The blacks are real black.

53:05.660 --> 53:07.780
It's got really good clarity.

53:07.780 --> 53:09.140
The sound's just amazing.

53:09.140 --> 53:12.100
And there's just plenty of green ooze in there.

53:12.100 --> 53:13.340
Now you want to be careful

53:13.340 --> 53:15.420
because if that green ooze gets loose,

53:15.420 --> 53:18.100
it will ruin the TV and curse you forever.

53:18.100 --> 53:20.420
But you're gonna love the definition.

53:20.420 --> 53:22.020
Everything you do to destroy this,

53:22.020 --> 53:24.260
let's just call it what it is, monster blood,

53:24.260 --> 53:26.500
is only gonna make it double in size and volume.

53:26.500 --> 53:29.980
But that's 1082 peas, so yeah.

53:29.980 --> 53:31.900
That ooze gets you that two extra peas.

53:31.900 --> 53:33.780
And nobody's quite sure what peas are still,

53:33.780 --> 53:35.340
like to this day.

53:35.340 --> 53:36.700
But I think they,

53:36.700 --> 53:38.780
when you're watching the Civil War on it,

53:38.780 --> 53:39.980
it just makes it.

53:39.980 --> 53:41.380
You're gonna love it.

53:41.380 --> 53:44.700
But again, if it is released,

53:44.700 --> 53:46.100
it's gonna eat your friends,

53:46.100 --> 53:47.740
it's gonna eat your babysitter,

53:47.740 --> 53:48.820
and every person that eats,

53:48.820 --> 53:49.820
it's gonna make a morning snack.

53:49.820 --> 53:51.420
Your dog's gonna eat some of it

53:51.420 --> 53:53.820
and it's gonna taste like lime jello,

53:53.820 --> 53:56.180
but then that dog, kiss goodbye.

53:56.180 --> 53:57.740
Yeah, it's gonna turn into a monster doggie.

53:57.740 --> 53:59.140
You're gonna have to kill it with a pickaxe.

53:59.140 --> 53:59.980
Yep.

53:59.980 --> 54:01.700
It'll be $450, please.

54:02.660 --> 54:04.140
This is a good book.

54:04.140 --> 54:05.700
By the way, I'd read this book.

54:06.580 --> 54:11.160
My favorite Goosebumps books are Camp Nightmare,

54:11.160 --> 54:14.860
the Choose Your Own Adventure one set in the amusement park,

54:14.860 --> 54:17.660
and then The Slime Time.

54:17.660 --> 54:19.600
Oops, Derek, I fucked up.

54:19.600 --> 54:20.660
TV shopping.

54:20.660 --> 54:21.940
My favorite is The Beast,

54:21.940 --> 54:23.320
which is a book Arlstein wrote,

54:23.320 --> 54:26.300
but does not, because it's set in King's Island,

54:26.300 --> 54:28.260
a favorite haunt of ours as a young man,

54:28.260 --> 54:31.500
but it is not in the officially licensed

54:31.500 --> 54:34.540
Goosebumps franchise, I guess you could say.

54:34.540 --> 54:35.860
It's too explicit.

54:35.860 --> 54:40.860
I like his sex romp, Fifty Shades of Green,

54:41.140 --> 54:45.880
and this one is, they have sex with monster blood?

54:45.880 --> 54:48.380
Okay, well, listen, that's gonna do it for us.

54:48.380 --> 54:50.300
Thank you so much for listening to our program,

54:50.300 --> 54:51.380
my brother, my brother, and me.

54:51.380 --> 54:53.380
Don't go anywhere, we have huge news.

54:53.380 --> 54:55.420
Huge news. Oh, sorry, yes.

54:55.420 --> 54:56.740
Don't change that dial.

54:56.740 --> 54:57.820
This is huge.

54:57.820 --> 54:59.300
This is huge.

54:59.300 --> 55:02.220
We've got two big, big, big live shows,

55:02.220 --> 55:04.460
and they're happening very, very, very soon.

55:04.460 --> 55:06.520
Unnervingly soon, I would say.

55:09.020 --> 55:10.660
Well, Travis, why don't you tell everybody?

55:10.660 --> 55:12.020
You seem very excited about it.

55:12.020 --> 55:16.340
It is June 3rd and June 4th,

55:16.340 --> 55:21.340
so like three weeks from now. Less than a fucking month, yeah.

55:21.500 --> 55:23.620
On June 3rd, Friday, June 3rd,

55:23.620 --> 55:26.180
we are going to be in Washington, D.C.,

55:26.180 --> 55:30.380
and on June 4th, we are going to be in New York City.

55:31.700 --> 55:34.960
I know we should have maybe been more explicit last time.

55:34.960 --> 55:38.060
I feel bad, actually, on how much we goofed on people,

55:38.060 --> 55:39.740
but we've never been to Washington, D.C. before,

55:39.740 --> 55:42.700
and we have a ton of listeners there.

55:42.700 --> 55:44.300
At least I fucking hope we do.

55:44.300 --> 55:46.820
Barry Obama called and said, please come do a show.

55:46.820 --> 55:47.660
I really want to see it.

55:47.660 --> 55:49.340
I'm like, what are we going to do, say no?

55:49.340 --> 55:52.740
D.C., June 3rd, we're going to be at the Lincoln Theater.

55:52.740 --> 55:54.900
You can find tickets for that show

55:54.900 --> 55:59.900
at bit.ly slash M-B-M-B-A-M-D-C, 2016.

56:00.420 --> 56:04.940
Bit of a convoluted URL, but I bet it's the best we can do.

56:04.940 --> 56:05.860
Well, that's only because I assume

56:05.860 --> 56:09.220
we'll be doing D.C. in 2017 and 2018 and 2019

56:09.220 --> 56:11.120
when everybody rolls up and shows us their love.

56:11.120 --> 56:12.860
Again, I would say we'll never go again,

56:12.860 --> 56:13.740
so you better make it count.

56:13.740 --> 56:15.700
Again, Lincoln Theater, June 3rd, Friday, June 3rd,

56:15.700 --> 56:19.340
bit.ly slash M-B-M-B-A-M-D-C, 2016,

56:19.340 --> 56:22.180
and then New York City, Saturday, June 4th.

56:22.180 --> 56:23.420
New York City!

56:23.420 --> 56:27.060
Okay, we're going to be at the PlayStation Theater,

56:27.060 --> 56:28.020
which is very exciting.

56:28.020 --> 56:29.340
Can't wait to hang out with Crash Bandicoot.

56:29.340 --> 56:30.180
Playing Uncharted 4.

56:30.180 --> 56:31.540
Can't wait to hang out with Crash Bandicoot,

56:31.540 --> 56:32.740
all my friends.

56:32.740 --> 56:37.740
That's bit.ly slash M-B-M-B-A-M-N-Y-C, 2016.

56:37.820 --> 56:38.700
You can find tickets for there.

56:38.700 --> 56:41.300
And when do the tickets go on sale, Trav?

56:41.300 --> 56:44.780
They go on sale May 13th, that's this Friday,

56:44.780 --> 56:46.980
at noon Eastern Standard Time.

56:46.980 --> 56:48.940
So last time we came to New York,

56:48.940 --> 56:51.700
we played at a theater that was like 90 seats,

56:51.700 --> 56:53.900
and we sold out literally instantly.

56:53.900 --> 56:56.060
PlayStation Theater is much, much bigger.

56:56.060 --> 56:58.420
I have no idea how quickly they're going to sell in D.C.,

56:58.420 --> 57:00.220
but hopefully it won't be as big a shit show,

57:00.220 --> 57:02.900
but we cannot add extra shows to the docket.

57:02.900 --> 57:07.700
It's just these two, so get your tickets fast.

57:07.700 --> 57:09.800
And also just know that in the past,

57:09.800 --> 57:11.780
we don't put the tickets on sale.

57:11.780 --> 57:14.400
They go on sale from the venue.

57:14.400 --> 57:18.820
So that noon, we tried to really push the people

57:18.820 --> 57:22.260
to wait till noon, but it wouldn't hurt

57:22.260 --> 57:25.280
maybe to start checking in 15 minutes beforehand

57:25.280 --> 57:27.200
just to see if they're live yet.

57:28.140 --> 57:30.740
We've had issues with that in the past, so just heads up.

57:30.740 --> 57:33.620
We also are, it's not just gonna be us.

57:33.620 --> 57:35.260
That would be boring.

57:35.260 --> 57:37.940
We are going to be joined at both shows

57:37.940 --> 57:42.180
by Saw Bones, a marital tour of misguided medicine

57:42.180 --> 57:43.660
that I co-host with my wife, Sydney,

57:43.660 --> 57:45.780
and we've got special podcast guests

57:45.780 --> 57:48.520
for different, for both of the shows, right?

57:48.520 --> 57:49.580
Yes, that is correct.

57:49.580 --> 57:51.220
In New York City, you're gonna be able to see

57:51.220 --> 57:52.900
Still Buffering before Saw Bones,

57:52.900 --> 57:57.260
and then in D.C., you're gonna get to see Schmanners,

57:57.260 --> 57:59.220
which is the show that I do with my wife

57:59.220 --> 58:01.620
about etiquette in the modern world.

58:01.620 --> 58:02.900
It'll be our first live show.

58:02.900 --> 58:04.500
We're very, very, very excited.

58:04.500 --> 58:05.600
Yeah, first for Still Buffering, too,

58:05.600 --> 58:07.460
so that's gonna be huge, big, big shows,

58:07.460 --> 58:08.640
three podcasts for the price of one.

58:08.640 --> 58:09.480
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

58:09.480 --> 58:11.620
Now, if you wanna see a live Rosebuddies,

58:11.620 --> 58:13.560
you tell me what the fuck that looks like.

58:13.560 --> 58:15.860
You just tell me how to fucking do that.

58:15.860 --> 58:17.400
Do we spend an hour making the audience

58:17.400 --> 58:19.820
watch an episode of The Bachelor before we talk about it?

58:19.820 --> 58:21.660
I don't know, I don't know.

58:21.660 --> 58:22.500
It's the eternal puzzle.

58:22.500 --> 58:27.340
We'll also tweet when the tickets go live, so just make sure.

58:27.340 --> 58:28.180
Just don't sleep on it,

58:28.180 --> 58:29.220
because I'm pretty sure they're reserved seats,

58:29.220 --> 58:32.680
so don't sleep on it, just buy your tickets.

58:32.680 --> 58:34.060
If you got questions for us,

58:34.060 --> 58:37.140
send to nbmbam at maximumfun.org.

58:37.140 --> 58:38.940
Travis already mentioned mackerelroyshows.com.

58:38.940 --> 58:41.280
There's a lot of other great max fun shows.

58:41.280 --> 58:44.780
Beef and Dairy Network is like my favorite new thing.

58:44.780 --> 58:46.580
It's so funny.

58:46.580 --> 58:48.740
Listen to it, it's like 10 minutes long.

58:48.740 --> 58:50.940
I also wanna say, Dear Hank and John,

58:50.940 --> 58:53.560
the podcast that Hank Green and John Green do,

58:53.560 --> 58:55.140
they've plugged us a couple times,

58:55.140 --> 58:56.300
and it's a really great show.

58:56.300 --> 58:57.140
It is a fantastic show.

58:57.140 --> 58:58.100
And they're absolutely lovely people.

58:58.100 --> 59:02.460
It's like our show if we were geniuses.

59:02.460 --> 59:04.740
Had anything to fucking offer the world.

59:04.740 --> 59:06.360
I got to hang out with Hank.

59:06.360 --> 59:08.300
He did an episode of Can I Pet Your Dog?

59:08.300 --> 59:11.400
And he's just an absolutely lovely human being.

59:11.400 --> 59:13.780
So thank you to them, and go check out their show.

59:13.780 --> 59:15.260
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters,

59:15.260 --> 59:16.540
who used for a theme song, It's a Departure,

59:16.540 --> 59:18.660
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

59:18.660 --> 59:19.920
It is such a good album.

59:19.920 --> 59:23.580
I started listening to When I Pretend to Fall a lot,

59:23.580 --> 59:24.940
which is weird, it's not usually a summer album.

59:24.940 --> 59:26.400
That's more of a fall, winter album for me,

59:26.400 --> 59:30.100
but it's a wonderful album, go check it out.

59:30.100 --> 59:32.500
And we have merch on Max Fun Store.

59:32.500 --> 59:35.040
It's maxfunstore.com, you can find it all there.

59:35.040 --> 59:36.420
Perfect, that's gonna do it for us.

59:36.420 --> 59:38.060
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo to sing this album?

59:38.060 --> 59:40.940
Hell yes, sent in by riding high Zoe Kinski.

59:40.940 --> 59:43.740
Thank you Zoe, it's by Yahoo Answers user, Brian Cohen,

59:43.740 --> 59:48.740
who asks, if animals don't want to be eaten,

59:49.780 --> 59:52.160
why are they made of food?

59:52.160 --> 59:56.300
I'm Justin McElroy.

59:56.300 --> 59:57.300
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:57.300 --> 59:58.920
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.660
Did my brother, my brother and me kiss your dad?

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:01.880
Square on the lips.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:06.880
Hey good girls, do you wanna just say, hey I wanna.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.960
Maximumfun.org.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.020
Comedy and culture.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.060

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.260
Listener supported.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.380
You guys, I'm so excited to introduce to you

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:31.360
my new baby, Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.480
This is gonna be a really fun look at things

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.420
that I find curious, whether it's a menstrual cup,

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:39.020
it might be the Romanov family, it might be fracking,

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.980
it could be Carly Fiorina, I don't even know, who knows.

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.420
It's gonna be whatever I think is interesting.

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:45.540
I can't wait to bring it to you guys.

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:47.040
We're gonna be bringing in content experts.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.460
I'm gonna be learning the things.

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:50.180
It's only gonna take about 30 minutes

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.340
for you to expand your baby brains with me

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.660
and have a super fun time, so I can't wait to see you

01:00:54.660 --> 01:01:01.660
on our first episode of Getting Curious.
