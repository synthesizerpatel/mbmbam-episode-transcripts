WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
I want you to keep that big grain of salt and be ready to take it.

00:05.640 --> 00:13.640
As you enjoy, Justin, Travis, and Griffin, ladies and gentlemen, McElroy Brothers!

00:13.640 --> 00:19.640
Your advice should never be followed.

00:19.640 --> 00:24.920
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:24.920 --> 00:30.480
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

00:30.480 --> 00:32.480
cool they are for listening.

00:32.480 --> 00:33.480
What's up, you cool baby?

00:33.480 --> 00:55.480
If you change your mind, if you need me, let me know when I'm here around.

00:55.480 --> 01:03.960
If you've got no place to go, when you're feeling down, if you're all alone, when it's

01:03.960 --> 01:21.960
really cold, let me know when I'm here around.

01:21.960 --> 01:22.960
Welcome.

01:22.960 --> 01:29.640
I am already very sweaty.

01:29.640 --> 01:30.640
And I'm spent.

01:30.640 --> 01:31.640
Good night, ladies and gentlemen.

01:31.640 --> 01:32.640
Thanks, good show.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.840
Another classic for the record books.

01:34.840 --> 01:38.160
We arrived here a couple minutes after Travis.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.680
Travis got here, of course, to help set up.

01:39.680 --> 01:40.680
Opening with the story, are we?

01:40.680 --> 01:42.720
Yeah, I just thought I'd open with it.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.800
We got here a couple minutes after Travis.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.440
His co-workers were looking for us.

01:48.440 --> 01:49.860
They don't know us.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.840
Travis had come in to set up.

01:51.840 --> 01:56.680
And the young lady sitting out there said, oh, you must be the brothers.

01:56.680 --> 01:57.680
We said, yes.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.080
She said, Travis said to look for you.

02:00.080 --> 02:04.760
She said that one of you was blonde and one of you was fat.

02:04.760 --> 02:08.240
Hand to God.

02:08.240 --> 02:11.680
Hand to God.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.960
I have no excuse.

02:13.960 --> 02:14.960
One of them?

02:14.960 --> 02:15.960
It's the dumbest.

02:15.960 --> 02:16.960
Like, I'm not blonde.

02:16.960 --> 02:17.960
I was in a rush.

02:17.960 --> 02:18.960
You were so in a rush.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.960
You don't know what the fuck hair color he has.

02:21.960 --> 02:26.640
And there's other, the thing is, the fact that I'm overweight isn't even the first

02:26.640 --> 02:27.800
thing people notice about it.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.800
One, he's the best rapper of the three of them.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.120
You will hear him drop beats and rhymes.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.160
Just forget his homemade toffee.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.160
Yeah.

02:37.160 --> 02:39.840
If he's carrying a great plate of toffee, that's Justin.

02:39.840 --> 02:45.200
Of course, I could also loop back into our original complaint about him being a portly.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.200
Festive.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.200
Festive.

02:47.200 --> 02:51.000
You're never too short on time for manners.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.680
Yeah, there's always time for, if there's one message we try to espouse on My Brother,

02:55.680 --> 02:57.720
My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.720
Hi, I'm Justin McElroy.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.720
I'm Travis McElroy.

02:59.720 --> 03:00.720
I'm Griffin McElroy.

03:00.720 --> 03:01.720
The blonde one.

03:01.720 --> 03:07.000
You guys, maybe you can't see this from the audience.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.520
I frosted my tips for this show.

03:11.520 --> 03:16.640
So I can think of two things that are different for this show than our last live show.

03:16.640 --> 03:17.640
Okay.

03:17.640 --> 03:21.120
First of all, we don't have tangible microphones.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.120
They're on our face.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.120
It's weird.

03:23.120 --> 03:28.120
They're attached to our face, which is great, because I don't know if you guys know this.

03:28.120 --> 03:33.640
I produced the show, and I edited it, which I think are the same thing.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.280
I pay you as though they're the same thing.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.280
Justin pays.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.280
I know.

03:37.280 --> 03:38.280
It's riding up.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.280
What's it doing?

03:39.280 --> 03:40.280
Thank you.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.520
Do you ever want to know what Griffin's glasses sound like?

03:42.520 --> 03:43.520
They've got a lot to say.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.520
They're super tender.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.520
For a show, they're super tender.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.560
They're super tender.

03:47.560 --> 03:54.240
We produce a lot of sound that is just genuinely sonically unpleasant to hear, and I catch

03:54.240 --> 03:55.240
it.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.900
On our last live show, we had mics, so if we had to make such a sound, we could get

03:57.900 --> 04:01.280
away from it, but this is going to be as raw as it gets.

04:01.280 --> 04:04.040
You're going to enjoy listening to us drink.

04:04.040 --> 04:09.280
Every gulp, every sip, every belch, every glottal stop.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.360
Is that a sound that people make with their mouths?

04:11.360 --> 04:12.360
A glottal stop?

04:12.360 --> 04:13.360
Yeah, I think so.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.360
Every sniffle, snort, sneeze.

04:14.360 --> 04:18.480
Guys, buckle in.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.520
Your ears are about to go on a roller coaster.

04:22.520 --> 04:23.520
So that's the first thing.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.520
Also, they look kind of like...

04:24.520 --> 04:25.520
I feel like I'm in a boy band.

04:25.520 --> 04:26.520
I don't know if you guys can see that.

04:26.520 --> 04:27.520
I just have the cord.

04:27.520 --> 04:35.280
I'm either a Kings Island performer or a founding member of S Club 7.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.280
We also have...

04:37.280 --> 04:40.440
Justin's sister-in-law is in the audience, who is how old?

04:40.440 --> 04:41.440
She's 10.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.440
10?

04:42.440 --> 04:45.560
I'm a little too young to hear some of the words we're going to say on the stage.

04:45.560 --> 04:46.560
So...

04:46.560 --> 04:47.560
Hi, Riley.

04:47.560 --> 04:48.560
Yeah, hi, Riley.

04:48.560 --> 04:49.560
Hey, Riley.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.560
They've requested...

04:50.560 --> 04:54.200
The Smurl family has requested that instead of using earmuffs, this is the only time we

04:54.200 --> 04:56.200
say it, like dick or...

04:56.200 --> 04:58.520
No, no, no, that one's fine.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.760
Or like a vagina.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.120
We have to use the term front butt.

05:02.120 --> 05:07.620
So as much as we can, we're going to interchange the two.

05:07.620 --> 05:11.480
So just a little pre-show anatomy, terminology.

05:11.480 --> 05:12.760
Fuck, it's so hot on this stage, you guys.

05:12.760 --> 05:13.760
It's really hot.

05:13.760 --> 05:14.760
Now it is.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.760
My front butt is sweating so bad.

05:17.760 --> 05:18.760
Oh, man.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.960
Both of my butts are unblesantly damp.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.440
I have to get out of here.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.440
Yeah.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.440
So let's get to the advice.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.440
What do you think?

05:25.440 --> 05:26.440
Yeah?

05:26.440 --> 05:27.440
Yeah.

05:27.440 --> 05:28.440
Yes.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.440
All right.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.440
Let's get it wet.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.000
Let's dump this melon.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.240
I've given up on clothing.

05:34.240 --> 05:40.680
Instead, I've opted for a uniform because I don't want to think about what I wear.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.840
Several black t-shirts and several pairs of jeans.

05:42.840 --> 05:48.080
It seems to work, but certain people around me think it's weird.

05:48.080 --> 05:51.560
Are they right or am I on the bleeding edge of wardrobe efficiency?

05:51.560 --> 05:52.560
Cole from Cincinnati.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.560
Cole, are you here?

05:53.560 --> 05:54.560
Cole, where are you?

05:54.560 --> 05:55.560
Cole, where are you?

05:55.560 --> 05:56.560
If you aren't wearing a black t-shirt and jeans, yeah!

05:56.560 --> 05:57.560
Dedication.

05:57.560 --> 05:58.560
I salute you.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.560
To the goof.

05:59.560 --> 06:10.560
Cole with a K from Cincinnati with a C. Well done, my friend.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.680
Well, well done.

06:12.680 --> 06:17.360
So first, before we really delve into the meat of the question, if people around you

06:17.360 --> 06:21.980
think your clothes are weird, but you think it works, that's pretty much the definition

06:21.980 --> 06:23.600
of your clothes not working.

06:23.600 --> 06:29.720
If you're talking about clothes working, you are covering all your, like, gentle bits.

06:29.720 --> 06:30.720
Yes!

06:30.720 --> 06:32.200
You're protected from the immediate elements.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.760
Like, yeah, I guess in that...

06:33.760 --> 06:36.880
Yeah, in the attitude tigers and the ice age, you're safe.

06:36.880 --> 06:37.880
Yeah, you're fine.

06:37.880 --> 06:44.160
My favorite fashion catchphrase is Tim Gunn, who says, make it work for you.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.000
Everybody else doesn't really matter.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Yeah.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.320
So, that's point one.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.320
Point two?

06:50.320 --> 06:51.320
I love it.

06:51.320 --> 06:52.320
I'm a big fan.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.320
I'm down.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.320
I think...

06:54.320 --> 06:56.320
I have maybe five shirts.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.320
Yeah.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.320
Five shirts.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.320
I have two pairs of jeans.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.320
One of them I favor.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.320
I favor this pair of jeans.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.360
The other one, I'm not so hot on.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.720
I think everyone has a favorite pair of jeans, right?

07:04.720 --> 07:05.720
Yes.

07:05.720 --> 07:09.680
Most people don't have, like, a swap-out, like a one-in-one-out system, like I do.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.520
You only have two pairs of jeans?

07:11.520 --> 07:13.480
You have, like, a favorite and then an off-court buddy.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.480
I do.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.800
That's what I call them, my off-court buddies.

07:16.800 --> 07:17.800
They've...

07:17.800 --> 07:19.320
See, Travis's jeans are almost exclusive.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.760
You're wearing your only pair of jeans that are not covered in paint and soot.

07:22.760 --> 07:23.760
That is correct.

07:23.760 --> 07:24.760
I bought them two days ago.

07:24.760 --> 07:25.760
Yes.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.760
Thank you.

07:26.760 --> 07:29.440
They're much smaller than mine, you see, because I'm the fat one.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.440
Oh, no.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.440
Oh, no.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.440
That's...

07:32.440 --> 07:33.440
Yeah, that's the whole show.

07:33.440 --> 07:34.440
Welcome to the show.

07:34.440 --> 07:35.440
Welcome to the show.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.440
Welcome to the show, Mr. Gentleman.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.440
This is the most custom of Bim Bam ever.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.440
Welcome to the grand finale of My Brother, My Brother.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.440
My Brother, That Other Guy, and Me.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.440
Who gets killed off?

07:40.440 --> 07:41.440
Spoiler.

07:41.440 --> 07:42.440
Travis.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.440
So...

07:43.440 --> 07:44.440
I feel like I'm getting cut, right?

07:44.440 --> 07:45.440
Yeah.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.440
Yeah, you're getting cut.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.440
I think...

07:47.440 --> 07:48.440
Like, I'm down with the whole, like, Doug Fonny ideology, too, wearing clothing.

07:48.440 --> 07:49.440
Right.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.440
You got a t-shirt, sweater vest, shorts.

07:50.440 --> 07:51.440
Covered.

07:51.440 --> 07:52.440
Unless I'm mistaken.

07:52.440 --> 07:53.440
I'm not.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.440
I'm not.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.440
I'm not.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.440
I'm not.

07:56.440 --> 07:57.440
I'm not.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.440
I'm not.

07:58.440 --> 07:59.440
I'm not.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.440
I'm not.

08:00.440 --> 08:01.440
I'm not.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.440
I'm not.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.440
I'm not.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.520
You're getting cut off by Travis.

08:05.520 --> 08:09.440
Unless I'm mistaken, that's our second Doug reference in 45 seconds.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.340
Offar Buddies is from...

08:11.340 --> 08:12.340
Holy shit.

08:12.340 --> 08:13.340
Yeah.

08:13.340 --> 08:14.340
Welcome to the live show.

08:14.340 --> 08:15.340
How about Patti Mani?

08:15.340 --> 08:17.360
She's a lucker, isn't she?

08:17.360 --> 08:18.360
Yeah.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.440
Anybody in here need more allowance?

08:20.440 --> 08:21.440
I do.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.440
Because I do.

08:23.440 --> 08:24.440
All right.

08:24.440 --> 08:27.100
What's up half of the alienated crowd?

08:27.100 --> 08:30.440
How does it taste?

08:30.440 --> 08:31.440
Wait.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.180
Do you think anyone in here isn't on board with Doug?

08:34.180 --> 08:36.940
Do you think anyone in here is going, what?

08:36.940 --> 08:39.520
Some people might be Eureka's castle, I don't know.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.360
That's fair.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.520
So, what's up?

08:42.920 --> 08:47.080
Have you considered actually investing in a literal uniform?

08:49.180 --> 08:51.100
Well, a jumpsuit might work.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.240
I like the interplay.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.080
No, let's do it.

08:53.080 --> 08:53.900
This is good.

08:53.900 --> 08:54.740
Let's get raw.

08:54.740 --> 08:58.700
Yeah, I can see a light on you now, Cole.

08:58.700 --> 09:03.680
I think, yeah, a jumpsuit, some sort of janitorial tunic.

09:03.680 --> 09:05.400
Some sort of oppressive imagery.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.240
Some sort of, like a magistrate's garb.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.080
Ooh!

09:10.200 --> 09:11.960
Or maybe we don't have to go that specific.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.400
What about just like a sailor, like a sailor thing?

09:14.400 --> 09:15.320
Yes.

09:15.320 --> 09:18.820
And I'm not talking like a modern seaman.

09:18.820 --> 09:23.240
I'm talking about like a blue and white sailor.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.080
Oh my.

09:24.080 --> 09:24.900
Oh, okay.

09:24.900 --> 09:28.820
Wait, now, what kind of sailor was that again?

09:32.820 --> 09:34.160
Like a sailor.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.000
Sailor.

09:35.000 --> 09:35.840
Sailor.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.280
Listen, he's excited.

09:37.280 --> 09:41.160
He's excited about his nautical craft.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.240
Aren't all sailors?

09:42.240 --> 09:43.080
Yeah.

09:43.080 --> 09:43.900
They love to.

09:43.900 --> 09:44.740
Really?

09:44.740 --> 09:45.560
Yeah.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.400
So, Cole, in closing.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.540
Be a sailor, become a sailor.

09:50.540 --> 09:51.880
Become a sailor.

09:51.880 --> 09:55.220
Just walk around the docks like,

09:55.220 --> 09:57.420
anybody need a hand?

09:57.420 --> 09:58.340
No, don't do that.

09:58.340 --> 09:59.840
Actually, no, I thought about it twice.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.680
Ha ha ha!

10:00.680 --> 10:01.500
Ha ha ha!

10:01.500 --> 10:02.340
Ha ha ha!

10:02.340 --> 10:03.160
Ha ha ha!

10:03.160 --> 10:03.980
Ha ha ha!

10:03.980 --> 10:04.800
Ha ha ha!

10:04.800 --> 10:05.640
Ha ha ha!

10:05.640 --> 10:06.480
Ha ha ha!

10:06.480 --> 10:07.300
Ha ha ha!

10:07.300 --> 10:08.140
Ha ha ha!

10:08.140 --> 10:08.980
Ha ha ha!

10:08.980 --> 10:09.800
Ha ha ha!

10:09.800 --> 10:10.640
Ha ha ha!

10:10.640 --> 10:11.480
Ha ha ha!

10:11.480 --> 10:12.320
Ha ha ha!

10:12.320 --> 10:17.180
That would require an entirely different kind of uniform.

10:17.180 --> 10:18.600
Oh, man.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.440
Oh, something stainless.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.280
Yes.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.660
Something, lot of mesh.

10:21.660 --> 10:23.600
Something that really features my front butt.

10:23.600 --> 10:27.240
Something that really shows off that FB.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.080
How about a Yahoo?

10:28.080 --> 10:29.740
Hey, how about one?

10:30.800 --> 10:32.020
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

10:32.020 --> 10:32.860
Thank you, Jacob Locker.

10:32.860 --> 10:33.700
Thank you, Jacob.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.520
In heaven.

10:34.520 --> 10:37.060
He is, he died and he's in heaven now.

10:37.060 --> 10:41.440
It is by Yahoo Answers user, Jessica, who asks,

10:41.440 --> 10:45.360
am I the only one who has a phobia of hot tubs?

10:46.740 --> 10:48.300
I have an epic fear of hot tubs.

10:48.300 --> 10:52.460
I was electrocuted by one before, and I've seen people

10:53.620 --> 10:56.280
on 1000 Ways to Die die in hot tubs

10:56.280 --> 10:59.180
for a few different reasons.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.680
If I get, they had a whole special.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.760
How many different reasons?

11:02.760 --> 11:04.600
We'll get to that.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.380
There was a raccoon in there with rabies.

11:06.380 --> 11:09.460
Maybe you're in a hot tub and someone shoots

11:09.460 --> 11:11.380
and stabs you to death.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.720
If I get close.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.160
I'm in a hot tub, I gotta eat coli.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.180
If I get close to one, I have a panic attack.

11:19.180 --> 11:22.100
I know it's silly, but I'm so afraid I'm gonna die in one,

11:22.100 --> 11:24.240
and it has nothing to do with drowning.

11:24.240 --> 11:25.840
Nothing to do with.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.300
I was just wondering if there was anyone else out there

11:28.300 --> 11:30.980
who's afraid of hot tubs, not drowning or drains

11:30.980 --> 11:34.720
or electrocution, but just hot tubs in general.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.360
Get that fucking thing away from me, man.

11:37.360 --> 11:40.240
What kind of life are you living that day to day

11:40.240 --> 11:42.400
you are confronted with hot tubs

11:42.400 --> 11:44.280
to the point that you can't avoid them?

11:44.280 --> 11:45.120
Right.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.200
Or he's in a cruise ship.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.480
Yeah, maybe think before you talk.

11:53.860 --> 11:56.560
What is the scenario exactly in which a hot tub

11:56.560 --> 11:58.320
poses a threat to you?

11:58.320 --> 11:59.340
That's not electrocution.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.240
Not electrocution, not drowning.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.120
I can't think of any time where I haven't looked

12:03.120 --> 12:06.360
at a hot tub and gone, ah, cool relaxation

12:06.360 --> 12:07.400
is coming my way.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.340
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:08.340 --> 12:09.340
Time out, time out.

12:09.340 --> 12:10.180
Cool relaxation?

12:10.180 --> 12:11.720
Cool, like.

12:11.720 --> 12:12.560
This is cool.

12:12.560 --> 12:13.940
I think you're familiar with the concept though, right?

12:13.940 --> 12:20.180
not just like okay fine it's either if I gotta do a hot tub that was cool I bet

12:20.180 --> 12:22.780
oh you got me

12:28.180 --> 12:36.780
you either get this is a bowl a hot a hot hot I don't know soothing water

12:36.780 --> 12:43.020
experience you go on a raunchy time travel adventure with your three best

12:43.020 --> 12:49.660
friends either way I know that's what they're afraid of that's terrifying yeah

12:49.660 --> 12:56.340
you're there with Rob Cordray and John Cusack and it is terrifying Griffin will never forget the time he was trying to make people who

12:56.340 --> 13:02.700
paid him to laugh and he mentioned hot tub time machine does that a thousand

13:02.700 --> 13:12.020
ways to die on stage yeah I Griffin McElroy I I don't like like you've been

13:12.020 --> 13:15.420
short on advice like just stay away from like don't go near hot tubs maybe like

13:15.420 --> 13:21.340
if you hear like rolling I do hot tub no yeah I hear say yes I hear rolling

13:21.340 --> 13:26.860
water I hear you guys ever encountered a surprise hot tub like you turn the

13:26.860 --> 13:30.620
corner and it's like oh what's that what's that pit of foamy spew it's like

13:30.620 --> 13:37.100
oh fuck it's a hot tub no I've got a boy scout induction that I want you hot tub

13:37.100 --> 13:41.860

13:41.860 --> 13:47.780
tubs it's like a fucking bathtub could be in an idiot Jessica it's a fucking

13:47.780 --> 13:53.820
bathtub that's like square instead of rectangular you dummy do you think she's

13:53.820 --> 13:58.100
afraid of bathtubs too like like if there was someone rounded out their bathtub

13:58.100 --> 14:00.660
she would freak out as it was do you think I do you know what I have a

14:00.660 --> 14:03.700
theory I think it is the communal experience of a hot tub over a bathtub

14:03.700 --> 14:07.960
which I totally agree with because we've talked about how does before like you're

14:07.960 --> 14:11.980
getting your balls particles in a soup with everyone else's balls particles and

14:11.980 --> 14:16.140
who knows like what kind of convection is going on in there I think though that

14:16.140 --> 14:19.420
if this was a pubic fear it would be specifically mentioned I have enough

14:19.420 --> 14:23.020
faith in Jessica that she would provide us she's afraid of the pubic ionic

14:23.020 --> 14:26.620
bonds that are going on in this hot tub what kind of show did this turn into you

14:26.620 --> 14:30.580
we have a ten-year-old in the audience guys listen you're right this is weird

14:30.580 --> 14:35.500
people came here for real talk this is real as it gets right sometimes your

14:35.500 --> 14:43.340
front but you soak it in water and what yeah and what it expands like a dinosaur

14:43.340 --> 14:45.700
in a phone

14:48.500 --> 14:58.100
oh god oh if only oh it's a chicken so much fun it's a my wife and I were on

14:58.100 --> 15:01.980
vacation and we saw a very peculiar sight we saw another couple with their

15:01.980 --> 15:08.820
baby but you see their baby had pierced ears real piercing what would make

15:08.820 --> 15:14.580
parents think this is an okay thing to do to a baby in arms follow-up would

15:14.580 --> 15:19.740
fuck but actually do that to their baby puzzled in paradise um before we get

15:19.740 --> 15:25.460
it again I hate to like stall on the wisdom how close did you roll up on this

15:25.460 --> 15:27.900

18:36.920 --> 18:42.980
piercing gentle this one was sent in also by Jacob locker thank you Jacob as

18:42.980 --> 18:49.780
always it's by Yahoo answers user Kelly are who asks how to start a letter to a

18:49.780 --> 18:59.460
friend that's in jail that's it that's it yeah that's it no like details of

18:59.460 --> 19:04.460
what they're in jail here I'll make him up or my friends in jail I would like to

19:04.460 --> 19:07.860
correspond with my friend but I'm too much of a pussy I'm too much of front

19:07.860 --> 19:13.620
but to go and talk to him in person do you have an easy an easy intro you can't

19:13.620 --> 19:17.420
be like I feel it like I feel this this this Cali are because you can't just be

19:17.420 --> 19:24.260
like salutations like there's there is there are two wrong ways to do this and

19:24.260 --> 19:31.980
the first one is to blow right over the fact that they are incarcerated did you

19:31.980 --> 19:37.820
go see bridesmaids yeah you can't see any movies they let him see prison

19:37.820 --> 19:42.380
movies what do you can you explain escape from Alcatraz like that like now

19:42.380 --> 19:46.820
see I thought that same thing Shawshank no Shawshank the wrong that's what I'm

19:46.820 --> 19:50.340
saying like you don't want to give these prisoners any ideas are there any movies

19:50.340 --> 19:53.620
where there are people who are in jail they're like yeah this is pretty fucking

19:53.620 --> 19:58.140
cool okay I can lift weights and stuff like all my friends are not well they're

19:58.140 --> 20:02.220
not here but my new friends are they show Shawshank but they cut it at the

20:02.220 --> 20:05.060
part where Morgan Freeman wants to go back to prison and like they have a

20:05.060 --> 20:08.020
little credits that come up at the end like and then he went back to prison and

20:08.020 --> 20:13.860
he was super happy prison awesome he totally regretted his top his time with

20:13.860 --> 20:17.820
Tim Robbins much like Susan Sarandon

20:20.460 --> 20:23.880
there was a prison version of that movie where he he goes to read was that was

20:23.880 --> 20:27.420
that Morgan Freeman movie read I don't know he goes anything can I get a rock

20:27.420 --> 20:30.740
hammer and he's like nope

20:30.940 --> 20:36.020
no you may not the prison edit have fun in prison forever

20:36.020 --> 20:42.660
so that's the first way the second way is to joke about it too soon like you

20:42.660 --> 20:47.700
got a can to rattle against those bars or like you've gotten like your has

20:47.700 --> 20:50.740
somebody touched your front bite in like a way that you didn't particularly

20:50.740 --> 20:58.140
enjoy interest yeah soap jokes are like right out the window I don't know is

20:58.140 --> 21:02.340
there any way that that sort of splits those uprights I mean you could talk

21:02.340 --> 21:06.460
about the awesome things you do on the outside yeah we think that enjoy that

21:06.460 --> 21:11.500
like I did just see bridesmaids and it was a revelation I enjoy the tweeting of

21:11.500 --> 21:17.460
birds and the child's laughter like that can they not cannot bring birds into

21:17.460 --> 21:21.180
the jail oh I like your right face I'm pretty sure so many times I got a bird

21:21.180 --> 21:24.780
that just seems I watched the prison edit though it might yeah it's at all

21:24.780 --> 21:31.340
all aviary life just got cut right out of that right up you it highly depends I

21:31.340 --> 21:35.940
think on how long they're in the clink if they got 20 years ahead of them you

21:35.940 --> 21:39.540
got you got to catch him up well no you got to say how terrible shit sucks out

21:39.540 --> 21:46.580
here man what tell him terrifying news on the outside I think that would get

21:46.580 --> 21:48.980
around

21:52.100 --> 21:58.380
the sky is lit with fire now where you are but everywhere else it's made a

21:58.380 --> 22:03.460
circle around your business and out here it sucks so bad you're the only safe one

22:03.460 --> 22:10.460
they outlawed ice cream what are we doing you gotta come back we need you

22:10.460 --> 22:17.580
here my wife's cousin and I their wife are staying with us overnight next week

22:17.580 --> 22:23.260
our house has no guest room my wife says that we need to offer our room to her

22:23.260 --> 22:27.420
cousin because that's a polite thing to do I say that they are not expecting

22:27.420 --> 22:31.460
extreme comforts considering the fact they are one not staying in any of the

22:31.460 --> 22:37.540
nearby hotels and two we didn't invite them they called and asked they called

22:37.540 --> 22:41.700
and asked if it would be okay if they stayed in our place what do you think

22:41.700 --> 22:47.020
this was fight worth fighting that's from be rad be rad no matter what we

22:47.020 --> 22:52.740
decide it's about to be if you're here Brad are you here very smart Brad nice

22:52.740 --> 22:59.140
job very cunning have we considered that be rad is short for like Bob rad hey

22:59.140 --> 23:02.980
what's up I'm Bob rad I want to be honest I made up that name okay okay

23:02.980 --> 23:08.460
that's good my bad did you make up the question to the question is there okay

23:08.460 --> 23:13.980
wait are you is this a bit are you did you make up a name for someone well

23:13.980 --> 23:17.260
let's just say I made up the name based off a real name I think you can put

23:17.260 --> 23:21.660
together with that real name okay so the guy is like what the fuck you feel like

23:21.660 --> 23:30.820
that's your goof is like Brad and a be rad get it you're off the show I think I

23:30.820 --> 23:36.980
know why be rad didn't raise his hand now that that Brad is divorced from me

23:36.980 --> 23:40.660
now that's another Brad it's a parallel universe Brad that calls himself be rad

23:40.660 --> 23:48.220
good work Travis you created a splinter universe so is it worth is it worth

23:48.220 --> 23:53.100
fighting I think unless your life is in like mortal danger that it's usually not

23:53.100 --> 23:58.260
worth fighting that's my you know my my marriage tip for everybody but uh so

23:58.260 --> 24:00.820
we're gonna go ahead and assume that no it's not worth fighting but then we're

24:00.820 --> 24:06.640
gonna go into a pretend universe okay never fight about it be rad though you

24:06.640 --> 24:14.140
know him he's crazy fucking scrappy yo fucking pull a knife on have you been

24:14.140 --> 24:18.140
like lying the whole time like how much have you made up in these all of them

24:18.140 --> 24:24.820
just pretty much okay listen Travis did doesn't know shit he's got to be advised

24:24.820 --> 24:29.820
constantly about every single thing on the earth

24:29.980 --> 24:36.660
wow this is every answer every yahoo question to all Travis gots to know about

24:36.660 --> 24:45.420
hot tubs he's very afraid shit yeah although that would be pretty scary so

24:45.420 --> 24:53.020
my wife's cousin listen I I think it's it's it's probably like if you fight

24:53.020 --> 24:55.740
about too much there's probably a good chance you'll end up sleeping on the

24:55.740 --> 25:00.260
couch anyway so why not it's a yourself some a question of how tangential that

25:00.260 --> 25:06.740
cousin is is it like you're fuck I don't know what a cousin is a brother's

25:06.740 --> 25:10.500
sister's son right like a dad's and Travis is the bad guy you don't know

25:10.500 --> 25:21.660
what a cousin is okay a cousin is your is your brother's your dad your dad

25:21.660 --> 25:29.580
it's your daddy's sassy son or son or daughter what right yeah so I think if

25:29.580 --> 25:34.500
it's that close then man yeah I mean doesn't it I think cousins aren't close

25:34.500 --> 25:38.620
enough that you they get the normal like familial privileges I think that you

25:38.620 --> 25:41.860
have to how close you gotta be how close you gotta be I think immediate family

25:41.860 --> 25:45.820
ob's grandma grandpa they're old they get the bed they need that bad yeah

25:45.820 --> 25:54.140
yeah have you seen their bones they're they're everywhere they're everywhere

25:54.140 --> 26:00.220
they're literally used to jangling in a jingling I thought you meant like what's

26:00.220 --> 26:05.260
this in my refrigerator oh it's grandpa's bones again the bad news is if

26:05.260 --> 26:08.500
you you will have to sell your mattress afterwards because they're gonna hold it

26:08.500 --> 26:13.580
up oh you're not gonna get rid of that smell that new old person smell you

26:13.580 --> 26:19.020
can't get that out so Brad long story short be rad you mean be rad you are

26:19.020 --> 26:22.700
right if that's what you want you are right you shouldn't have to give up your

26:22.700 --> 26:27.100
bed but you're gonna have to give up your bed yeah right it's not this is not a

26:27.100 --> 26:30.100
battle you're gonna you're gonna win or is really worth fighting I mean nobody

26:30.100 --> 26:36.180

26:36.180 --> 26:42.100

with that question I'm just now you're embarrassed and you're so we're moving

31:34.180 --> 31:38.700
on no no no let's I mean if we have more things to add on the she's the man yeah

31:38.700 --> 31:42.580
I think well I think we could probably do like if anything's like a but worse

31:42.580 --> 31:46.580
idea I like that mother who's included there just in case anyone was wondering

31:46.580 --> 31:51.740
because if you can get past your wife that's cool but if your mom goes what's

31:51.740 --> 31:55.980
the deal well she's got maternal you're a feminine friend she's got maternal

31:55.980 --> 32:05.140
insight she knows she knows when you two have been just rub two hands together

32:05.140 --> 32:17.060
she knows what you've been working on a plan to kill Superman I've I've worn

32:17.060 --> 32:21.060
glasses since I was three years old but recently I've been feeling like they're

32:21.060 --> 32:25.820
keeping my sexy back I've I've been thinking of maybe ditching them in

32:25.820 --> 32:30.300
favor of contacts or LASIK but at the same time I'm a total nerd and I feel

32:30.300 --> 32:36.100
like the glasses kind of reflects some street cred there in senses glasses no

32:36.100 --> 32:42.260
glasses help skeptically be spectacle

32:42.260 --> 32:51.780
are they here no no and fuck them listen whoa straight up I don't care what you

32:51.780 --> 32:57.740
do I usually don't but don't get LASIK like don't get LASIK I'll tell you why

32:57.740 --> 33:02.660
it's because they cut off the tip of your eye with a laser right like that

33:02.660 --> 33:06.540
is like an hybrid it's like a ninja where the sword comes in it's like I'm

33:06.540 --> 33:10.420
just gonna take a little off the top and it's like a barber he's like a ninja

33:10.420 --> 33:16.220
barber I guess and like oh wait just to jump back tiny ninja laser barber yes

33:16.220 --> 33:20.900
and he cuts off the tip of your eyeball so you can see better like you know how

33:20.900 --> 33:25.220
LASIK works as far as I know no no I read it I saw a documentary on

33:25.220 --> 33:29.620
Discovery Channel they get a tiny ninja barber with a laser beam that cuts off

33:29.620 --> 33:33.420
the tip of your eyeball I don't think that's accurate at all that's what

33:33.420 --> 33:38.420
you're singing with that's my story I've read 1984 a few times I'm pretty sure

33:38.420 --> 33:42.380
that the people who when they go to the place and the guy says I'm gonna shoot

33:42.380 --> 33:45.860
your eye with a laser but trust me it's all cool those are the people that are

33:45.860 --> 33:48.500
first with their backs against wall when the revolution comes that's all I'm

33:48.500 --> 33:56.260
saying if you'll buy that line of laser propaganda double talk I think you'll

33:56.260 --> 34:03.580
believe anything I think LASIK is double plus good I get if I were to get some

34:03.580 --> 34:05.900
sort of corrective eye surgery I would definitely get it at the Ministry of

34:05.900 --> 34:19.900
Love you mean the last one yeah I was there it was good so they got into this

34:19.900 --> 34:24.340
or William or well Ian but it went 20 minutes and then they ended in they

34:24.340 --> 34:26.820
said they were done forever because one of them called the other one fat it was

34:26.820 --> 34:36.780
weird I I thank you I don't like just wear the glasses glasses are like a

34:36.780 --> 34:40.580

34:48.500 --> 34:51.980

40:43.860 --> 40:47.620
my time catching up with people who are still very important to me do I confront

40:47.620 --> 40:54.100
her and ask her to stop do I ignore her when she tries or do I just keep doing

40:54.100 --> 41:00.460

bitter icy gesture of an unfriendly she goes it is tantamount it is show it is

42:28.540 --> 42:34.940
tantamount to murdering somebody on the internet yeah this is like a word Becky

42:34.940 --> 42:41.620
go she's fucking gone she's goes she's been imagined away it's it she won't

42:41.620 --> 42:44.860

twilight name it's a twilight name twilight name

44:34.900 --> 44:45.580
ran is may Osmond asks I salute you by the way I need so fuck I need someone to

44:45.580 --> 44:50.060
play a Donny Osmond fantasy game with me

44:50.100 --> 44:58.940
all you need to do is respond to this as if you were the hot man himself Donny I

44:58.940 --> 45:06.140
love you I'm only 15 but I think you're a cutie do you like me I like you and

45:06.140 --> 45:11.500
your music I often listened at puppy love will you dance with me sometime I

45:11.500 --> 45:16.300
always dance around my room with a pillow pretending it's you I know this

45:16.300 --> 45:20.380
probably sounds strange to you but I just think you're so handsome I can't

45:20.380 --> 45:28.820
stop thinking about you oh man the first man to travel to space to inhabit

45:28.820 --> 45:32.020
another planet will be Donny Osmond because you can't know that's out there

45:32.020 --> 45:38.540
and not I'm out I have to get off this planet before I'm shuffled off this

45:38.540 --> 45:44.300
planet my favorite thing about that question is the phrase you probably

45:44.300 --> 45:48.980
think this weird now as if there is a circumstance in which that isn't weird

45:48.980 --> 45:53.980
right that's normal I would say Vegas on the over under on you finding this weird

45:53.980 --> 45:59.140
I don't know three to one I felt pretty good about you think this is weird let

45:59.140 --> 46:02.740
me know if this affects the odds I danced a puppy love with a pillow which

46:02.740 --> 46:16.700
I've put I put a wig on the pillow to simulate your your flowing flowing the

46:16.700 --> 46:20.100
coolest thing about the internet is you know the old bit that like comedy is

46:20.100 --> 46:25.860
tragedy plus stop it reduces that to zero oh god on the internet is instant

46:25.860 --> 46:35.100
tragedy so here we go 15 man start now who the fuck is a 15 year old in love

46:35.100 --> 46:38.780
with Donny Osmond yeah I'll tell you what is it she sounds like a hipster

46:38.780 --> 46:43.340
right so it's like instead of what generational gap knows who Don I'm saying

46:43.340 --> 46:47.060
that general occasion that generational gap has moved forward a bit so if like

46:47.060 --> 46:50.420
if I wanted to be a hipster I'd be like oh man across we stills and Nash right

46:50.420 --> 46:55.180
but like for her it's all Donny Osmond all the time I feel like that's a really

46:55.180 --> 47:00.300
specific genre well fuck out specific like she's fucking crazy out of her mind

47:00.300 --> 47:07.180
I want to know what Twilight character got her into Donny Osmond where did

47:07.180 --> 47:11.780
where did she make the leap between like I like Edward wish he was a little

47:11.780 --> 47:21.100
whiter I wish he had a sister who he might maybe fuck I'm a little bit

47:21.100 --> 47:29.380
country I'm a little bit vampire I I'm a little bit all alone this is her oh now

47:29.380 --> 47:33.740
it'll only be like that for her whole whole life

47:34.220 --> 47:44.340
I think I'm gonna cat named Donny Osmond in a few years and by the way it's a

47:44.340 --> 47:51.060
puppy is the gag you don't damn it puppy love right there I feel like let's

47:51.060 --> 47:55.540
give it three years okay okay she's 18 she's of age now literally nobody else

47:55.540 --> 48:04.380
knows who Donny Osmond fucking Marie Osmond is like hey what's Oh Donny God

48:04.380 --> 48:07.940
I'm so sorry Merry Christmas

48:08.340 --> 48:14.300
cuz it's Christmas time it's that you've built a world for your bit I built a

48:14.300 --> 48:21.260
whole Donny verse if you will it's working out great for her yeah the Donny

48:21.260 --> 48:27.620
verse that she's built for herself it's more of a prison like a permanent

48:27.620 --> 48:38.740
emotional forever present it's circled around again by the way it was funny and

48:38.740 --> 48:46.140
now what is the appropriate way to deal with an ex at a wedding the situation is

48:46.140 --> 48:50.060
this we were together when a mutual friend got engaged we split up six

48:50.060 --> 48:54.220
months ago we have not really spoken since then so I have no idea if she will

48:54.220 --> 48:58.460
have a plus one or if she's even going I've since begun seeing someone else and

48:58.460 --> 49:02.100
I would like to invite her to come with me to the wedding I'm concerned that if I

49:02.100 --> 49:06.060
bring a date and my ex is there alone it could potentially upset her and I

49:06.060 --> 49:12.740
wouldn't want to do that at this point at this point considering just staying

49:12.740 --> 49:17.780
home to avoid the situation but I would hate to miss my friend's wedding RSVP

49:17.780 --> 49:26.300
reluctant are you here RSVP reluctant what whoa whoa it got weird uh fuck it

49:26.300 --> 49:32.380
you won you won fuck it you know this is not a contest yeah it's always a con

49:32.380 --> 49:35.860
yeah like you totally you already have the winning handle unless she shows up

49:35.860 --> 49:42.060
with two dudes or a dude and a half it's like eight and a half feet tall

49:42.060 --> 49:48.900
Jesus what if it's one of the burn Troyer like that or just Donny Osmond who

49:48.900 --> 49:56.140
I would consider a dude and a half yeah or a pillow covered in tears either way

49:56.140 --> 50:02.660
that's negative that's negative ten dudes yeah listen you got a beater you

50:02.660 --> 50:07.580
gotta win gotta win gotta win gonna have to assume that she's gonna show up to

50:07.580 --> 50:13.060
that joint with Bradley Cooper on her arm and it's like you got what yeah I'm

50:13.060 --> 50:17.900
saying maybe she knows Bradley Cooper I'm saying maybe she knows Bradley

50:17.900 --> 50:28.180
Cooper I'm saying she knows Bradley Cooper not mr. Cooper she's not hanging

50:28.180 --> 50:31.140
she's not hanging she is that she's gonna make that joke at the wedding

50:31.140 --> 50:35.820
because it's gonna be awkward she doesn't know Brad very well oh be right

50:35.820 --> 50:40.460
she doesn't know Bradley good like she is hanging with Bradley Cooper you mean

50:40.460 --> 50:46.900
be Radley Cooper if she shows up with Bradley Cooper and be Radley Cooper then

50:46.900 --> 50:51.460
you're in trouble because that's a splinter verse situation I would say you

50:51.460 --> 50:55.740
just go like I think you're past the point of it's nice of you to care but

50:55.740 --> 50:59.660
you don't have to yeah you're done with that listen did that all in the

50:59.660 --> 51:02.980
relationship you don't have to care now what you do six billion people on this

51:02.980 --> 51:08.460
beautiful globe a good percentage of them you gotta say fuck it all right I

51:08.460 --> 51:13.540
don't mean I don't mean that like I mean you just gotta your heart is this big

51:13.540 --> 51:16.820
you don't have room for people that aren't in it anymore so they're kind of

51:16.820 --> 51:22.900
over there you're you should be busy caring about your date yeah yeah hey

51:22.900 --> 51:25.740
is it gonna be weird for your date cuz then you've got it don't even worry

51:25.740 --> 51:30.220
about that all you got to worry about is getting your front but what

51:31.940 --> 51:39.180
that's that is the truth that's that's some raw truth I like that cuz you don't

51:39.180 --> 51:43.260
you don't have to give a shit about her here's what you do you you worry about

51:43.260 --> 51:47.380
your front but and that everything else is just gonna fall into place cuz either

51:47.380 --> 51:50.300
one or two things gonna happen she's gonna beat you she's gonna show up with

51:50.300 --> 51:53.780
Bradley Cooper you can't there's no female on earth as equivalent to Bradley

51:53.780 --> 51:58.460
Cooper on the other end of the spectrum right so she was like wins with a Trump

51:58.460 --> 52:02.780
card like unless you become the guy that beat the shit out of Bradley Cooper

52:02.780 --> 52:08.060
which let's get realistic did you he's not gonna happen it no zero chance he is

52:08.060 --> 52:13.940
a dreamboat he is a dreamboat and a pugilist

52:15.940 --> 52:20.140
you learn how to fight from Quentin Rampage Jackson and Liam Neeson they

52:20.140 --> 52:24.660
told your other option is to get Quentin Rampage Jackson or Liam Neeson to go

52:24.660 --> 52:31.300
with you just as moral support I think you could probably do it they'll defuse

52:31.300 --> 52:34.260
the situation much like I imagine they defuse the bomb in the hit film the a

52:34.260 --> 52:41.060
team I haven't seen no I'm told it your third option is just try to make her

52:41.060 --> 52:52.100

how much time we have left ten minutes go Jesus this one was sent in by Blake

54:38.020 --> 54:42.860
thank you Blake it's by Yahoo answers user idiotic who asks if drugs are

54:42.860 --> 54:47.020
legalized does that mean I will find needles and used items in my hamburger

54:47.020 --> 54:54.660
slash food when legalization passes and heroin addicts are accepted into the

54:54.660 --> 54:59.900
service sector hey of course hey dog what do you think heroin addicts are

54:59.900 --> 55:05.100
doing now oh that's a good point when they legalize it and they have to quit

55:05.100 --> 55:11.460
their jobs as professors and doctors right Reggie that's a Reggie that's a

55:11.460 --> 55:14.860
pretty sweet score that you have there what are you up to nowadays oh I'm a

55:14.860 --> 55:20.340
bank manager slash heroin addict I managed a Chase Bank on the corner and

55:20.340 --> 55:27.180
on the weekends I just fucking pound that hammer 2007 yeah they do work at

55:27.180 --> 55:30.980
McDonald's that's a lot of people didn't know that not only not exclusively

55:30.980 --> 55:33.860
McDonald's like people who work at McDonald's they used to work at

55:33.860 --> 55:36.900
heroin addicts and not only that when they work at McDonald's put their use

55:36.900 --> 55:43.860
needles directly into this like just fold the burger patty around it no one

55:43.860 --> 55:48.380

55:48.380 --> 55:51.460
in there enjoy that it's got it's full of special sauce

55:51.460 --> 55:56.820
wank okay point one if they were McDonald's they don't have the money

55:56.820 --> 56:00.780
just be throwing needles away like they're gonna second use those I would

56:00.780 --> 56:04.620
say my more direct question is what conversation is going on in America

56:04.620 --> 56:09.300
right now that's like maybe we should legalize heroin is that a thing that's

56:09.300 --> 56:13.420
going on did I miss the conversation in Washington heroin here's what here's

56:13.420 --> 56:17.340
why you'd pass it heroin is the only drug I can think of that is not a

56:17.340 --> 56:20.060
gateway drug

56:20.060 --> 56:29.540
the fucking guy yeah thank you after going through nine or ten gates and it's

56:29.540 --> 56:36.620
like well I'm here you guys unless you consider the fun and excitement of

56:36.620 --> 56:41.140
working in the fast-food industry a drug I'm hooked on the problem is if you if

56:41.140 --> 56:46.340
you if we pass a law that says heroines totes cool go crazy somebody is gonna

56:46.340 --> 56:51.460
invent crackle in which is you just take crack and you pour it into heroin like

56:51.460 --> 56:55.340
that's the next step crackle ins are actually the proudest

56:55.340 --> 57:01.940
tribe of native that's true it's history it's hard to judge like it's hard

57:01.940 --> 57:06.700
there's no metric for pride but we're pretty sure it's the crackle and yeah

57:06.700 --> 57:12.980
mmm mmm that's good that's good stuff I hear that you remember racks you know

57:12.980 --> 57:16.620

tattoos just covered in tats track marks and heroin stains oh that's why that's

59:03.420 --> 59:07.260
why he was behind the fence he was riding the right in the lightning

59:07.260 --> 59:14.100
writing them is that a fake please tell me that if it's a thing I okay no he's

59:14.100 --> 59:18.660
right all the heroin users out there straight up H's we need your help

59:18.660 --> 59:26.860
H heads he's H that was a test you pass yeah we have smack oh we have sky

59:26.860 --> 59:31.780
marshals in the audience I think we have two of those and one of these so maybe

59:31.780 --> 59:35.660
do another one of those yeah sure gotta move quick though these people got so

59:35.660 --> 59:39.460
I sent him by Peter Urmston thank you Peter it's by y'all who answers user

59:39.460 --> 59:47.780
Adrielle who asks my writing instructor told us we need to touch the horse's

59:47.780 --> 59:54.380
vagina before we can write it there was this front but before we can write it

59:54.380 --> 01:00:04.980
that makes no sense to me at all is there any truth to this I mean it's

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:11.740
gonna before you ride a horse you gotta earn its trust yeah we are we are on a

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:18.620
stage right now a theatrical stage yeah with the the poet take that of the

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:23.900
years yeah lording over us what if we just did a quick performance of Equus

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:28.380
like right here on the stage that'll be cool I don't know who we're gonna get to

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:36.800
play the horse as I will have to no one from the audience no this is not the

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.760
proper we've never done audience participation in the show but when we do

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:44.940
it will almost certainly not involve one of us touching a front but

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:51.460
almost sir almost I'm gonna leave us 95 96 percent chance yeah the horse you're

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:56.060
right Justin the horse will go faster I imagine because horses are very long

01:00:56.060 --> 01:01:03.300
circumstance that a horse goes listen a talking horse that's all right well yes

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:08.180
he'll give you a she will because dude horses don't have vaginas and front

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:12.460
buts characteristically they both have front butts but go on different casts

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:22.820
right different genus is a front okay it'll be more than this look I think it

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:25.020
will be a little bit more incredulous than that I think we'll give us like a

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:30.420
pain like here's what's up horses are are very long they're very long creatures

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:35.980
most equestrians extraordinarily long okay they don't know the left hand or in

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:40.180
this case front half doesn't know what the back half is doing so if it's some

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:45.940
like if a human hand touches their vagina front but front but if they feel

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:51.740
like human grasp on their front but like whoa what is that what is that

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:56.400
sensation I think that I think it's gonna I think somebody's going to break

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.620
that down with the whole separation between the front the back you're

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:05.100
saying no if a human hand touches it it doesn't register as horse masturbation

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:08.940
and they don't know what's going not to the horse okay have you seen a horse yes

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:15.260
you have seen a horse yes is there any horses on the straight no I'm not gonna

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:26.740
get we got horses on all fours okay okay okay so you're a horse okay so you're a
