00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
We're gonna give advice and do funny skits, laughter it is in store.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Come inside and see, it's time to start.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
It's My Brother, My Brother and Me.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Omi, I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm Woof Woof Travis McElroy, a dog?

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Still doing it, this is Griffin, still doing it.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Well, I tried to make it go up at the end because I had a question I wanted to ask,

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
because something's really been kind of, you know, just stuck in my old craw.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
It's just an age-old question I've been trying to figure out.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
A riddle even?

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
No, not quite a riddle, but it's more like when you wear a shirt, right?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
You go out into the world wearing a shirt.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Right, right, right, right.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Which side of the shirt is the side that's getting dirtier?

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
The outside that's out facing the world or the inside a rubbing up against your body?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Well, this is challenging.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
This is tough.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
There's parts of my body that are fucking filthy.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Right.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
And there is, and we take great strides to mitigate that.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Right.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
But the armpits, are we limiting this to just the shirt or are we talking pants too?

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
You can't ask that of pants because you know the answer of pants,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
and it's which side's the googer on and it's in.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Well, yes, because the extension of this question, right, is if you wear two shirts, right?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
And I do.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
If you have an undershirt and an overshirt.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Very prominent nipples Justin's got.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
He's got to get two shirts in there to just pin those bad boys in.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
If you get home, right?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Right.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Which shirt is the dirty shirt?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
The dirty shirt, yeah.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Can you wear the undershirt again?

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Can you turn the shirt inside out and you're good?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Where are we at with this?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Well, okay, where are you spending your days?

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
Are you spending it in a clean office?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Are you spending a stinky fungus forest?

02:39.000 --> 02:49.000
Let's say I am walking around, okay, I'm walking around Columbus, Ohio on a 72-degree day.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Oh, perfect.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Columbus really comes to life in the springtime.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Yeah, but it's not so hot.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
The finches.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Oh, baby.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Oh, and the finches are flitting down the old Ohio.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
The Columbus finches.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Oh, when they were turned from Capistrano to Columbus.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Oh, that's good, clean air.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
That's good, clean American air right there.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
It's good, clean air, but a recognizable city.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Now, I could have gone with Cincinnati, but I already live here, and I don't want to speak hypothetically.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
There's too much baggage.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
There's a lot of emotion tied to that city.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
And during a game day, you walk outside.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Oh, forget about it.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
That shirt's instantly dirty.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
So, it's 72 degrees.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Perfect.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Oh.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
72.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Sorry.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
Justin and I are just spending time in our memories thinking about all of our great Columbus springs.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I understand.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
Can I emerge from the doors of the Center on Science and Industry, or COSI?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Of course.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
And I'm headed to Cozy, the sandwich place.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Right.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Okay.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Right.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
And he's feeling cozy in this great, comfortable air.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
72 degree weather.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
This question's a bad question.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Why?

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Well, I can answer it with a single word, and that word is jackets.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Okay.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Hmm.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
So, you wear a shirt and a jacket outside in a beautiful 72 degree.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Maybe it's like a light jacket.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
And you come back in, and end of the day, you put on your night clothes, and you take off your shirt.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Working in your night clothes.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
My long night shirt.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Right.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
And your cap with your single candle.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Of course.

04:28.000 --> 04:37.000
And you retire the shirt that has been rubbed against your huge prominent nipples and your stinky arm, like your arm goochers.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
And that goes in the hamper.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
But the next day, new shirt, same jacket.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah, but just because we've always done that, Griffin, doesn't mean it's right.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
Listen, this is all good stuff, but Griffin started talking about nightcaps.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
And I was thinking, you know the cap, and they got the fuzzy ball at the end all the time.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
We love that.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
What's that about?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
So you can find the end of it easier.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:10.000
Are you suggesting that I would be casually stroking up the top of the hat, and I would get to a place where I wasn't sure if I was touching air or hat?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Well, it's dark. You only have the one candle.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
So you're like, how high is this hat going?

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
And then you worry that maybe you've moved on to a certain, like now you've reached the chandelier, right?

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
You missed the end completely, and you just keep going.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
You need a sort of anchor when you're working in the dark in old Victorian times where you just have the one candle.

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
You need something to sort of establish a depth perception, like target, and that's what the ball is for.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
And it can also be a fun game for when you get bored or you're very, very sick with an old Victorian disease laying in bed.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
You sort of swat at it like a kitty cat does.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Oh yeah, or when you're snoring and you're going honk, me, me, me, me, me.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
Your breath is like blowing that little ball up and it's bopping you back in the nose, you know what I mean? It's fun.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
It's so funny and cute.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
So which side of the nightcap is getting dirtier?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
The ball side.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
My body makes more filth than the room or area I'm in.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
I can pretty much guarantee that. It's terrible.

06:12.000 --> 06:21.000
My body consumes things and turns it into, I guess, more bones and meat and flesh that makes me up.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
And then everything that doesn't make the cut just gets impressed into my clothing.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
It's a real horror show.

06:28.000 --> 06:38.000
Isn't it wild to think that we spend our lives eating food so our bones can get thicker and thicker until one day we die and it's just skin on bone?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
What are you talking about? This is a comedy show.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
You said you had something fun and light for the opener. I'm so disappointed in you.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
I am officially revoking your ability to initiate the program.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
Hey Justin, I just killed about six and a half minutes.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
No, but that's not about this. I've been away from art for so long.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
It's been a while.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
It's been a while since I've made any art.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Your friend Art Garfunkel?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
No, see that's exactly what I'm talking about.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
That's what Justin's hinting at.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
No more fucking duds.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
This show is no longer about art.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
You've been away from art and it sounded like it.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
Hey guys, it sounded like a name and that name is Art Garfunkel.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
That you are right now pointing at the basketball underneath the hoop and it's like,

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
well, I thought I threw it high enough to get it in the hole, but I just threw it into the slushy stand.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
That's what happened with that one.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
You're right, you're right.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
We know.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Fart Garfunkel.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Thank you, there it is.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
No Justin, no Justin, Justin, no Justin, Justin.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
He got there.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
I'm going to revoke Travis's privileges from now.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Okay, we haven't been able to make art for two weeks.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Justin, you haven't been able to make fart.

07:50.000 --> 07:59.000
Because of the weather and stuff and because of that, Borat 2 beat Hamilton for the Golden Globe

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
and we let that happen on our watch because we didn't make any art for two weeks

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
and America forgot, you know what I mean?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
America forgot.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Has anyone checked on Lin?

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
I talked to Lin last night after Borat beat him so soundly and I promised him on my mother's grave

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
that if Borat beat him for the Golden Globe, it would be discussed in the introduction of this program.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
So now I have cashed that in.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
There it is.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Thanks for checking in, Borat.

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
Borat, is there anyone you'd like to thank?

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
He wants to thank his reggae horn that he travels with at all times.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
That was a real bump set just dookie on the ground.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
That was a nice setup and a failure to deliver.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
We love Borat.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
We do love Borat here.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I'm saying, here's what I'm saying.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Everybody wins the Golden Globes because everybody had a great time.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
And the stars came out to play.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Did you guys actually – you guys probably didn't watch, did you?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
No.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
Sydney likes award shows so we checked in.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
It was all wild.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
It was a tough watch.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
It was a tough watch, but Trav, this is going to sound like I'm making it up,

09:16.000 --> 09:24.000
but in the interstitial before and after commercials, they would point –

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
the celebs that were about to be up for awards were all logged into Zoom, right?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Sure.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
And they would point – basically point their screens at one another

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
and encourage them to make fun small talk.

09:38.000 --> 09:45.000
So I got to watch Bob Odenkirk trying to lure Al Pacino out of his trance

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
and lure him into some light conversation as the announcer was like,

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
what's up? We've got another award.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
And it was all, I mean, really –

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
It was really, really difficult.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Jason Bateman was there with his kids and I was like,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
he shouldn't be exposed to this environment.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
None of them should be.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Were any of them playing Fortnite while receiving their awards

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
and telling people to smash that like and subscribe button?

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Jason Sudeikis was essentially doing that.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Yeah, it was basically mid-kill streak, I think.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Nice.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Anyway, can we –

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
I just want to say in a serious note, it's been like a while

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
since we've been able to record one because of Earth.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
And I just want to say it's a genuine pleasure

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
and I'm thrilled to be here with you.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
And I won't let Travis post up anymore.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Fucking dookie.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
All gold.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
All right.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
550.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Yeah, a special one.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
We've got a lot planned.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
I'm a big fan of Formula 1

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
and a lot of the teams are doing raffles

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
during the preseason period this spring.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
The prizes are mostly things like merch

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
and invites to a virtual car launch event.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
And some are offering virtual meet and greets with the drivers.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
The issue is why I love a signed team hat.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
The idea of winning a video call with a Formula 1 driver

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
fills me with terror.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I'm trying to mentally prepare just in case

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
but I'm drawing a blank.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
What are some cool things to say when you're talking

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
to a race car driver over Zoom?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
That's from Inane in the pit lane.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
I tell you what.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Call Inane.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Got pit lane.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
Do you think that the best sort of telecommuting,

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
telework solution for a Formula 1 driver is Zoom?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Do you think they feel very comfortable?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Oh, I see.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
They're like, oh, this is the sound of my good, fast car goes.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Zoom, Zoom.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Zoom, I love it.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
I'm very comfortable.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Hey, I can tell you're uncomfortable talking to me,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
at Champson, talking to me over Zoom.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
But let me tell you, I feel very comfortable

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
because the name of this application is the sound

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
of my car go.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Zoom, Zoom.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Thank you.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I think we can all agree the first question is, of course,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
how fast have you gone, right?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah, what's the fastest you get?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Because I think that they'd be excited to, one,

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
have a nice softball.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
But if they're not excited to talk about how fast they've gone,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
why are they in Formula 1?

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
Can you get the fake back of a car, like, rear windshield

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
driving background that they used to use for, like,

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
Toontz's The Driving Cat as your rear zoom?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Can you make that happen just to make the race car driver

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
feel comfortable?

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Oh, and then have them be, like, your driver.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
So, like, you're sitting in the back seat and just turning

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
into a conversation where you're like, hey, could you slow

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
down a little bit?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
You're going very, very fast.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Oh, you just took that turn pretty quick.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And I asked you to go to Whole Foods.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
No, I said take a right.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
No, only left here.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Actually, I think Formula 1 courses, they zigzag all over.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
They don't do just a big circle.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Really?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
That's too exciting for me.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
I think so, yeah.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
I think that the how fast you go question doesn't really

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
have legs or wheels in this case.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
If you want, try bouncing that off me.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I'll be Chet Chamsom, beloved Formula 1 racer.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
So how fast have you gone?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Ha ha ha!

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
200.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
1 miles per hour?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Yep.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Well, we do kilometers, don't we?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Pretty European Formula 1.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Ooh.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
What's that translate to in miles?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
No one knows.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Oh, okay.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Oh, sorry, my dog just came in the room.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Hey, buddy, what's up?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Let me see those precious toe beans.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
These are his toe beans.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Oh, honey.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
His name is Chet Chamsom the dog.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I named him after you.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
I hate that.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Hey, can I say that actually felt a lot more,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I was going to try to illustrate like that's a bad topic

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
of conversation because it doesn't really go anywhere

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
from there, but Travis, you are a fucking born

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
conversationalist.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Thank you very much.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Even when I was trying to fucking stump you,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
you made me feel so comfortable and involved.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
How did you feel when the dog came in?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I loved that.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
It's not real, but I couldn't, yeah, I could envision

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
the precious toppers, toe beans.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Actually, if I can admit this, when Travis says

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
his dog came in, I thought that his dog came in.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Thank you.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
He was like so deeply inhabiting the role.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Well, I've actually been training my dogs to come over

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
when I'm on Zoom calls because it makes everybody

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
so happy.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I give them little pieces of bacon and they come over

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
and everyone's like, oh, doggo.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
And they get really excited.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
I didn't even have dogs before the pandemic.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
I bought them specifically for Zoom calls to make

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
people happy.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
And you know what?

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
When the pandemic's gone, I'm going to sell them.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Sell these dogs.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah, and you get a little bit of sweat equity there.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
The dogs have gotten bigger.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Yeah, they got bigger and I trained them.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Right?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Yeah.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
I think that if you get on a call with this stranger

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
and you say, hey, thanks for taking the time to talk

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
to me today, but I really just want a hat.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Can you send me a hat and we don't have to talk?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
And the stranger goes, absolutely.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
And then you can hang up the phone.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
I will say this, I can think of almost no Zooms I've

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
been on in the last year where if someone said,

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Justin, you can hang up right now if you promise to

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
send me some kind of hat.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Absolutely.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Done.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
I'm already closing the screen.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Hey, Chet Jamson, in all your 50 years of racing,

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
what was the best fan interaction you ever had?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Oh, man, let me tell you.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
One time this guy let me get off a Zoom call super quick.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
It was amazing.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
I named my son after him and I didn't know his name,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
though, so I just called him Hang Up Guy.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
This is my son, Hang Up Guy Chamsun.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Happiest I've ever been.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
Better than any race I've ever won was that time.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
It was the fastest Zoom call I've ever been on.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
And you know me, I love speed.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
I crave it.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I was in the middle of watching the season finale,

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Ozark.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
I was like, hell yeah, get right back into Ozark.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
See how Jason and the kids are going to get out of this one.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Zoom Zoom, that's the sound a car makes.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I went ahead and knocked over a Lids

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
so I could have more get out of call free tickets.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
And now I'm in prison and it was worth it.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
It was worth it to get off that Zoom call,

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
no questions asked.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
And I've knocked over the Lids

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
and they fucking caught me while I was driving away.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Can you believe that?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
The irony.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
The irony.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Chet Jamson.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Do you all want a Yahoo?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah, I'd love that.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
This one is sent in by Casey.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Thanks, Casey.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
It's a Yahoo Answers user, Bush, who asks,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
my grandkids want to start a detective agency.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Yes, nice.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Should I start staging crimes for them to solve?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
I'm worried about them actually solving it

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
and figuring out it was me.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Well, yeah.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
I mean, the latter worry is a strange worry

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
unless the crimes you were attempting to do

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
was like manslaughter.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
No, but here's the thing.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Even if it's like, oh, you know,

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
Bugsy stole the fucking class pet or whatever.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
If you figure out that's your grandpa,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
I mean, after two of those,

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
even if it's just pretty money,

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
it's always grandpa.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
You're like, fucking grandpa.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Like, are you okay, dude?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Like, you stole the class pet

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
and then you stole that little kid's prize marble shooter

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
or whatever.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Like, what are you doing, grandpa?

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
Well, Trav, did you ever watch The Sherlock Show

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
with Ben and Bic?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Elementary?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Yeah, right?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
No, the other one.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
That one had-

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Oh, the one where Sherlock Holmes woke up

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
and it was like modern day San Francisco.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
No, that's still elementary.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
This one had been a kid.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Yeah.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
The Hobbit.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
The Hobbit.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
And it was just Sherlock.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
It was just right down the middle of Sherlock.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
There wasn't like a special thing about it.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
It was just straight over the plate Sherlock.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Do you remember that one?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Yeah.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Well, in that one-

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
A little bit.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
In every case, they'd be like,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
oh, the mummy did come back from the dead

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
and is killing all the people at the museum

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
or the people at the circus have been also killing people.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
But at the end of each one, it turns out it was Moriarty.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
And then at the end of the first season, Moriarty dies.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Whoa.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
And you say, whoa, hold on a minute.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Now who's going to do the crimes?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
And sure enough, the next season,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
there's a big crime that happens

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
where one of the guys, his wife does it.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
And you're like, whoa, what?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
But then you're like, you find out later,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
it was still Moriarty.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Do you see where I'm going with this?

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Is the grandpa Moriarty in this?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Well, yeah, that's what I'm saying

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
is that you steal the lunch money

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
and they find out, oh, it was grandpa.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
And grandpa said, I did that as a test for you.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
And then the next thing is the class pet goes missing

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
and everybody thinks it's Bugsy,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
but it turns out it's the grandpa.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
And they say, well, now we know

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
that grandpa's doing all the crimes.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
So grandpa fakes his own murder.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Okay.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
But it turns out it was a plot by grandpa,

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
but at that point, grandpa is no longer with us.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
And then another crime happens and the kids go,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
well, it can't possibly be grandpa.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
He's dead as hell.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
But somehow it's still grandpa.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Do you know what I mean?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Yeah.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
The only way to get the kids off your case is to be dead.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Well, yes, I mean, obviously Griffin, that's 101.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Can I just say that my favorite part about this question

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
is if you read between the lines a little bit,

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
that grandpa is worried that the kids will solve it,

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
but not sure they will.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
So the grandpa does think one of two things.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
One, that these kids are wicked stupid.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
Or two, that grandpa might secretly turn out

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
to be a master criminal and create an unsolvable mystery.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Right, yeah.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Yeah.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
You know, we were talking about Sherlock.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
There's something wild about that is Elementary.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Remember that show?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
We were talking about Elementary.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Yeah.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Yeah, I like it.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Well, Justin, you were talking about Elementary, but go on.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Yeah, but I want to talk more about Elementary.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Never watched a single episode of it.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Ran for seven years.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Yeah.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
Ended in 2019, which explains why I haven't heard a lot about it lately.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Yeah.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
But this is the thing I wanted to say.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
There's 154 episodes of this show.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Okay, syndication right there, baby.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Yeah, Johnny Lee Miller is, of course,

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
is now the actor who's played Sherlock Holmes the most times

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
because there's so many episodes of it, okay?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Right.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
There's 154 episodes of the show.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
There's got to be one that centers on pro gamers, right?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Okay.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
There's got to be one episode where Sherlock's like,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
this is the gamers.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
The gamers evolved.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Okay.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
It's got to be his mouse cord that did the motors.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Right.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
There's got to be one Elementary episode that's centered on pro gamers.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Right.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
So there's a bit where Lucy Liu has a Google Cardboard headset strapped to her face,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
and she looks up at Sherlock,

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
but she's obviously still seeing the game world in her headset,

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
and she says, so if you die in the game, and he says,

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
then yes, you die in real life, love.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Hey, real quick.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Trav, can you help us build this incredible episode of Elementary?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
No, I understand.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
I just want to read a paragraph here from The Return of Sherlock Holmes,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
a 1987 television movie.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Okay.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Following those instructions, Jane Watson finds a hidden basement

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
containing a primitive cryogenic capsule with a man lying inside,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
whom she thaws.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
The man inside the capsule turns out to be her ancestor's friend and partner,

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
the legendary Sherlock Holmes himself.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Cool.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Cool, man.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
That sounds pretty good.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Hey, I have an exciting new segment.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Okay.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Oh?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
And I sneak previewed this to Travis,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
but I am so excited to get started here.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
I was cruising the web recently.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Like you do.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
And I was so excited to find out that there is a company

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
that makes these decks of cards that you can use for podcasting,

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
and it's to help you do a good podcast.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Thank you, finally.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
I know, and I was like, finally it's time to step up our game.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
You know, we're pros.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
We wrote the book on podcasting.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
It could always be better.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
You know what I mean?

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
That's what we should have called our book.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
It could always be better.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
Each of you is going to get a card, and I'm going to let you choose.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I have five different decks of these fuckers here,

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
but we're going to talk about you're each going to get to pick one.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Travis, would you like a card from the interview deck,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
the would you rather deck, or the what the heck deck?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Oh, would you rather.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Don't you dare take what the heck.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I have called dibsies.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
Okay, Travis, I'm going to select a card at random from the would you rather deck.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Finally, this podcast is going places.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
This is good, man.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
We don't even have to think with our fucking forebrains anymore.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
We can just slip slide into that.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
It's all instinct now, right?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
It's just instinct.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
All right, Travis, would you rather –

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
God, I hope it's dirty.

22:51.000 --> 22:59.000
Would you rather have to grow, hunt, and kill your own food,

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
or eat only Taco Bell for a year?

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
This is terrible.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
That is fucking terrible.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
I mean –

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
No, really think about it, Travis.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
You are an impulsive person.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
I need you to really go through it.

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
Grow, hunt, and kill?

23:17.000 --> 23:23.000
Yeah, I mean, you could hunt a chicken and then eat it while it's still alive.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
That seems a little brutal.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Or eat Taco Bell for a year.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
What wildly different options.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
Yeah, that's kind of what makes it fun, you putz.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Well, no, Justin.

23:34.000 --> 23:42.000
Typically, in a would you rather, they don't pair up a really, really rough option with an incredible windfall,

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
with an incredible blessing.

23:45.000 --> 23:52.000
Yeah, I've never eaten Taco Bell for two successive meals.

23:52.000 --> 23:58.000
Yeah, but if I eat Taco Bell every day for a year, you know what?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Every month.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Every meal.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Yeah.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Sorry.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Every meal.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Sure, sure, sure.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
But what I'm saying is, you know what I am now, Justin?

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Fucking internet famous.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
I've made a documentary that's called Live Moss.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
Live Moss, you are dying.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Live Moss, E-minus.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
And it's like, okay, now, who knows?

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
Now maybe I'm rich.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
I've got an endorsement deal from Taco Bell.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
Or the other option, do a lot of fucking work.

24:29.000 --> 24:35.000
Yeah, there's a lot on the Taco Bell menu.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
And we make a lot of jokes, but Taco Bell is delicious.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
You could rotate through the menu in a way that you could sustain your body and keep it alive.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
Especially now that Papa Fritz is back.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Yeah.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
All right, Griffin, so did you want something from the-

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
I want something from-

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
What the heck?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
What the heck?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Just say what the fuck.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
No, you don't get it, man.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Okay.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Yeah, you don't get it, man.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
It's a what the heck deck.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
It sounds better.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
What the tech deck?

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
Griffin, what slogan or jingle got stuck in your head forever?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Oh, man.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Forever.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
There's a lawyer in town.

25:13.000 --> 25:22.000
And I am not familiar with the type of work that he and his firm does.

25:22.000 --> 25:32.000
But I do know that he spent several hundred thousand dollars commissioning a song for his little firm.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
And the song, if I may sing a few bars, it goes,

25:35.000 --> 25:43.000
FUNK and Associates! FUNK and Associates! FUNK and Associates! Call FUNK and Associates!

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
So it's FUNK and Associates.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
It's pretty good.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
And it's good.

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
And what I love about it is Dr. FUNK, or whatever his name is, the lawyer-

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Probably FUNK Esquire.

25:55.000 --> 26:06.000
Dr. FUNK Esquire, the lawyer, had a really easy bridge to cross there to have a funky song.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
But he didn't go that way with it.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
He went in a much more earnest FUNK and Associates.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
It could have gone, we want the FUNK and Associates.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Or it could have just been like, call me.

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
Like literally, it didn't have to be this song that goes as hard.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
I lose track of time when I'm hearing it because I'm having such a good time.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
I could swear it's like a five minute long commercial.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
That's great, Griffin.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Justin, do you want to do one for yourself?

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
I'll ask myself something from the interview deck.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Since it's the other one I have opened here.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
That would be a fun podcast, by the way, if anyone wants to steal this.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Would you just interview yourself every week?

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Yeah.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Let's see how this one goes.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
I picked a card at random.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
I'm not even going to look at it.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
I'm going to read it blind.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
It just says, how big is it?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
How big is it, that ding dong, though?

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
How much would someone have to pay for your little toe?

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
I don't want to answer that.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
No, tell me.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
You have to.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Because then you'll start getting fucking Venmo requests.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Yeah, exactly.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
I don't need that.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
What's something I would never guess about you, Justin?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Justin, nobody knows me better than you.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.000
I think that that would be a pretty tough one to answer because you know me better than I know myself.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Right.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
What is something that people are obsessed with but you just don't get the point of?

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Oh, nice.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Hot takes.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
Do something about like Sports Bowl.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Or like Game of Thrones.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Is that still wildly popular?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
That could be good.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
Do you have any opinions on Lost you want to share, Justin?

27:36.000 --> 27:42.000
If you were stranded on a desert island and you could choose one person to keep you company, who would it be?

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
Just draw from the what the heck deck, man.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Yeah, you're right.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
I'm clowning on myself.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I need to just get into the what the heck deck.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Here we go.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
What the heck?

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
This one is...

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
I haven't gotten it out yet, but I bet this one's going to be something else.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
If you could bring one famous person back from the dead, who would you pick?

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
What?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Yeah, what the heck, man?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
What the heck?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Princess Diana maybe?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Travis, you're not...

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Sorry.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Sorry, I know it's not my question.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Sorry.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
You already had yours.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
This is my question.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
I did not realize what you just did.

28:15.000 --> 28:21.000
If Justin says anyone other than Princess Diana, he's going to seem like a real jagoff.

28:21.000 --> 28:27.000
Okay, well, if Justin could think of somebody who died before their time, was super beloved...

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
Yeah, he's going to say anyone but anybody else and people will be like,

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
man, I guess Justin really doesn't like Princess Diana.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Good job, Trav.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
I don't know, Trav.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
I guess I was thinking of Martin Luther King.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Oh, okay.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Maybe that's a little bit better than yours, Travis.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
It is the classic, would you rather bring back Princess Diana or Martin Luther King.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Or eat Taco Bell.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Or eat Taco Bell every meal for a year.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
Or if you could eat Taco Bell with Princess Diana.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Mm-hmm.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
Or go hunting with Martin Luther King.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
I'd bring back Abraham Lincoln so I could beat him at Xbox.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
That would be so good.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
He thinks he's so tall.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
People think he's so cool, but when he's freaking out over airplanes, I'm going to steal his wallet.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
Can I just say, to jump back to the Taco Bell conundrum,

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
I didn't think about the implications of eating Taco Bell for breakfast and the effect of that.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Do they have breakfast food at Taco Bell?

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Yeah, you want me to list the entire menu for you?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
I'm just saying if they don't and I have to eat tacos for breakfast,

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
it's going to severely impact my ability to get things done.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
You know what's awesome is I am looking at the Taco Bell menu website,

29:36.000 --> 29:43.000
and they do have categories like combos, tacos, burritos, nachos, quesadillas, etc.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
That's sort of the major food groups.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
But then they also have a little section below that that says,

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
can't decide?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Perhaps you're craving something.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
And then there's three options, and it says meaty, cheesy, spicy.

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
So it's like, damn, I don't know what form I want the food to take,

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
but I do know what I want it to do to my mouth and taste receptors.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Can I ask you something?

30:06.000 --> 30:11.000
If Taco Bell introduced a surprise me option, would you take it?

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Every day.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Yeah, me too.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I think so.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
I think most drive-thru places, if I just saw an option that said surprise me,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I think I'd just take that one.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
If there's an option that says fill a bag of it, Derek,

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
and that's only when Derek's working.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
He's got a special promotion called fill a bag of it, Derek.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
For $20 worth, Derek.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
You got your D bucks?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Come on over.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
This is how many things you can get.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
Fill it to the top, Derek.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I was going to cloud on these pod decks,

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
but this is the name of the people that make them, pod decks.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
Talk about conversation, fruitful.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
And I treasure it.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Sure, we got there.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
Because now I'm just thinking about Derek throwing a bunch of fucking fire sauce

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
into a bag, loose.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
Yeah, but if it's $20 worth of fire sauce, that's a good deal.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
That's a great deal.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
You can resell that for sure.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
I hate when they ask me if I want sauce there,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
and there's no chef to consult.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
What's the pairing?

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Yeah, exactly.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
What would you suggest?

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
What do I want to drink?

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
I don't know.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
Does Dr. Pepper go with the chalupa?

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
We're going to take a quick break,

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
and the ad guys are going to come in and do their ads real quick,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
and us fun boys will be back right after this.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Hey guys, is it time for me yet?

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Not yet.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Okay.

31:31.000 --> 31:51.000
Now it's time for you.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Hold on.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
I got to do a bunch of cocaine first.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Okay.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Sorry, who is this character?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Ad man.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
Justin, stand back.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Let him do it.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
Oh God, he inhaled it through his mouth.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
That's not normally how one does the cocaine.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
No one ever taught me they don't teach this stuff in school, you know.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
They don't.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
Squarespace.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
Squarespace lets you make a beautiful website

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
that showcases your work, sell products, and services of all kinds

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
and promotes your physical or online business and more.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
I don't actually know that Squarespace would love.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
No, I don't think so.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
I was just thinking the same thing, Griffin.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Okay, this is normal Griffin.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Uncocained Griffin.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I've not done any drugs.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
This is high on life, walking with Jesus.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
High on life, walking with Jesus.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
I mean, I smoked a bunch of pot last night,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
and I drank coffee this morning,

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
and I took my sort of brain regulators.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Jesus would be okay with all of those.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Jesus is cool with all that stuff.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
And so would Squarespace,

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
because they have beautiful customizable templates created by world-class designers.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
They got everything optimized for mobile right out of the box

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
and analytics that help you grow in real time

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
with free and secure hosting and nothing to patch or upgrade.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Hey folks, here's a call to action.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
and when you're ready to launch,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
use the offer code mybrother to save 10% off your first purchase

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
of a website or domain.

33:17.000 --> 33:22.000
Now, here's the Griffin McElroy call to action.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.000
Squarespace has allowed us to get away with so much.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
True.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
If you need to make a website,

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
at this point, for the principle of the thing,

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
go to squarespace.com slash mybrother.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
Even if you don't think, if you've ever thought to yourself,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
I wonder what having a website's like.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
Go to squarespace.com slash mybrother and use the free trial

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
and when you're ready to launch,

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
use the offer code mybrother to save 10% off your first purchase

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
of a website or domain.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Force your boys who have gotten away with murder.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
You may be thinking to yourself,

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
my idea for a website is too rowdy for Squarespace.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Apparently not.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
And they will not endorse it.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
I can guarantee you, from life experience, this is not the case.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
I don't know if Squarespace has a front page like Twitch

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
or Reddit or something, but if they do,

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
I'm thinking the rowdier the better to get up to that front page.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
I think so.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
I think Squarespace is the cool parent who's like,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
my kids are going to fuck up.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
I would rather they do it at the house.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Yep.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Yeah.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
We are safe in this.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
Squarespace is going to get us through this bad trip

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
and they're going to still pay us at the end of the day.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
And that's radical and powerful for us.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
So squarespace.com slash mybrother for a free trial.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
When you're ready to launch, use the offer code mybrother

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Holy shit.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
Hey, you know what?

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Dolan out accolades.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Same to you, stamps.com.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Yeah.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
It says here in the introduction or thought starter,

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
if you guys want to talk about butts or whatever, go for it.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
We're cool.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
We know we can't stop you at this point.

34:53.000 --> 34:58.000
We lost the email that lets us cancel these ads.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Right.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
There's a two factor sort of code that we have to punch in,

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
but we reset our phone and we can't stop the machine at this point.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
But taking trips to the post office isn't how you want to spend your time.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Stamps.com allows you to-

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
How do you want to spend your time, Griffin?

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
Reading this incredible ad copy.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
Because they allow you to mail and ship anytime, anywhere,

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
right from your computer.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
You can send letters, ship packages, and pay a lot less

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
with discounted rates from USPS, UPS, and more.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
I was trying to set it up that we could say something ribbled or blue there.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
Well, I do still want to promote the business.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
Because if you're a small office that's sending out invoices

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
or an online seller shipping out orders,

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
or even a giant warehouse sending thousands of packages a day,

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
stamps.com can't handle it all with ease.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
You get 40-

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
I'm photocopying my butt and mailing that to people.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
There it is. They love that, Trav.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
They love it?

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
Well, you can get discounts up to 40% off post office rates

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
and up to 62% off UPS shipping rates.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
Oh, man, 40% off my butt is a great deal.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Yeah, it's like a cheek and a fifth.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
So stop wasting time going to the post office and go to stamps.com instead.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
There's no risk.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
With our promo code MYBROTHER, you get a special offer

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
that includes a four-week trial plus free postage and a digital scale,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
and there's no long-term commitments or contracts.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Just go to stamps.com, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage,

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
type in MYBROTHER, that's stamps.com, promo code MYBROTHER, stamps.com.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
Never go to the post office again.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
Maximum Fun is a network by and for cool, popular people.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
But did you know it also has an offering designed to appeal to nerds?

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
A show for nerds?

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
On Maximum Fun? The devil, you say.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
It's true! It's called The Greatest Generation.

36:41.000 --> 36:46.000
And they review episodes of a television program for nerds called Star Trek.

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
They've reviewed TNG, DS9, and are now reviewing Voyager.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
Hey, Star Trek. My daughter enjoys that program.

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
Well, if she enjoys that and she enjoys humor of the flatulent variety,

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
might I recommend she subscribe to The Greatest Generation?

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Hey, are you calling my kid a nerd?

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Why, I ought to...

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Well, gotta go!

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
Become a friend to DeSoto by subscribing to The Greatest Generation on MaximumFun.org today!

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Okay, all right.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Yeah.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
I want a munch.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
Squad! Squad!

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I want too much.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Squad?

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
We've already talked about Taco Bell so much.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
It almost counts. We're not gonna talk about Taco Bell, we're gonna talk about Duncan.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Okay.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Real quick note about Taco Bell, though.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
They are testing a crispy chicken sandwich taco,

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
which is gonna be a taco with crispy chicken in it.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
There's only one thing that I wanted to point out here.

37:48.000 --> 37:55.000
It's got premium all-white meat, crispy chicken, marinated in jalapeno buttermilk,

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
then seasoned with bold Mexican spices, and roll in the crunchy tortilla chicken.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Sounds very good.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
God, I'm extremely hungry.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
I'm just not realizing I would eat 50 of these.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Yep.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
I just wanted to read this paragraph.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
Taco Bell is offering both a regular and spicy sidekick.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
Each sandwich is served in a puffy bread.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Hey, thank you, Taco Bell.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Thank you.

38:17.000 --> 38:23.000
This is a huge moment where Taco Bell has finally let go of any illusions

38:23.000 --> 38:28.000
that they are serving anything that in any way approximates Mexican cuisine.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
They are saying, here's what this is in.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
It's puffy bread.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
We don't have anything to add to it, okay?

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
It's just puffy bread.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Can I tell you what I love here?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
This is like if...

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Don't get hung up on this, because it seems like a good lunch spot.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
I know, I know, I know.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
But we talk about the chicken wars a lot.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
And this is like if, like, in World War II, like some other...

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
Like if, let's see, what's a country I can pull out of my head?

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
I'm gonna sit here.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
If like, if like Brazil.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Oh, no, Brazil I think was in it.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Who's someone?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Yeah, Travis, go on.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Antarctica.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Yes.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
If someone in Antarctica at a science research facility said,

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
you know what, now Antarctica is in the World War II as well,

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
and we're a major player.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Which side?

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
We don't know yet.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
If somebody wants to court us.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
We are still figuring it out.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I'm sorry, fellas, I'm sorry.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
I'm looking at a picture of one of these fucking bad boys

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
and I would do some...

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Yeah, I would house it.

39:25.000 --> 39:30.000
I would do terrible things to get one of these in my mouth right now.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Terrible things.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
I need to learn which countries are all involved in World War II.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
You very much do.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I can tell you some that definitely were.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
Don't get me wrong.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
Yeah, the big boys.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
It's just that I don't know that I...

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Some that definitely were, some that definitely were,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
and then there's like a whole kind of mushy gray area

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
where maybe they got into it, maybe they didn't.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Yeah, right?

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
And I don't want to take a sling at those, right?

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Because then that's what I'm gonna hear back like,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
oh, no, they did terrible things.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
There's probably some that were on the bad guys side

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
that aren't exactly crone about it, right?

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Yeah, right?

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Maybe you could ask them to their face and be like,

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
ah, no, no, no, no.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Hey, was that you?

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
I don't know.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I'd have to check up on that.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
The same thing's happening in the chicken wars, by the way.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
We're gonna find out 20 years from now.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Yes, thank you.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
We understood.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
We know exactly where you were going with that.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Okay.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Burger King, by the way, get in the chicken wars.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
I knew it.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
They got a new sandwich they've been working on since 2019.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
It's got chicken on it.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Probably gone bad by now.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
Dunkin' has added avocado toast to the menu, folks.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Huh.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
All right.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
Yeah.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
Kevin Sorbo thinks about that.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
So I get Kevin Sorbo on the phone

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
to ask him about the Dunkin' avocado toast.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
What is it?

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Dunkin' avocado toast.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
You know what it is.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
It's a popular pick for breakfast or brunch,

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
and now it's available for everyone to enjoy quickly

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
and conveniently as part of any busy day.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
Dunkin's avocado toast features creamy avocado spread

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
made with four simple ingredients.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Avocado, balsamic salt,

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
black pepper, and lemon juice.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
This smooth combination is, man,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
they really do have eight paragraphs here

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
about what avocado toast be.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
This smooth combination is spread out edge to edge

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
on Dunkin's authentic toasted sourdough bread.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
This is my favorite part.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Dunkin's authentic toasted sourdough bread

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
made from a recipe created especially by Dunkin'.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
Okay.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Wait, what?

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Hold on.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
I thought you were gonna say anything else

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
because that is the least surprising thing you can say.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
And let me also just throw this out

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
to someone who's been making a lot of sourdough bread

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
over the last year.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
There's only like four ingredients in there, Dunkin'.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
That's not wildly impressive.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
But it's a recipe created especially by Dunkin'

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
using a true sourdough starter for a tangy twist

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
that elevates the avocado toast.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Okay.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
You put some old flour water in it.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
We get it.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Yeah, that's not necessary.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
For this one, we have salt.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Yeah.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Yes.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Then for an extra dash of flavor,

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
the avocado is topped with everything bagel seasoning,

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
which includes sesame seeds, poppy seeds, onion, and garlic.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Everything, right?

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Yeah, it's everything bagel seasoning.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
Dunkin's avocado toast is available for $2.99

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
and is served in a special portable box.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Oh, sorry.

42:20.000 --> 42:24.000
It replaces our previous option of a non-portable box

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
made from dark matter.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
You have to sit here and eat it.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
We're going to watch you.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
We're going to watch you.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
It's chained to the table like a 3DS at E3.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Just sit there and eat it.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
The shape of the box is non-euclidean.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
Your hand will pass right through the bread.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
You might not even know it's the box when you see it.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Dunkin's, this is from Jill Nelson, the veep

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
over at Marketing and Culinary,

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
or Mark Cul, as I call it, at Dunkin.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
Jill says, Dunkin's new avocado toast

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
is the definition of quality.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Oh.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
Delivered at the speed of Dunkin.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
We've taken a popular brunch staple

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
and made it accessible for anyone

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
looking for something easy and delicious on the go.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
So this avocado toast is for people

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
that have been hearing a lot about avocado toast

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
and just thinking like, how can I get me some of that?

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Because I cannot piece it together on my own.

43:17.000 --> 43:23.000
I do like, hey, avocado toast now for everyone.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Yeah.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
Now you don't have to be some snooty hipster.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
Now even your racist uncle can eat avocado toast.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
Do you think that this marks the end of avocado toast?

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
And here's what I mean.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Not that I think Dunkin's going to ruin it,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
but now that it's for everyone,

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
I, a snooty hipster, am less interested in it.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
Right, now that it's not fun anymore to blame the collapse

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
of the housing market and diamond exchange and-

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Stocks?

43:54.000 --> 43:59.000
Travel and stocks on this mushed up vegetable?

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Yeah.

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
Then it's not, who cares anymore?

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
Also, do you think that when avocados came along,

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
the person who had named eggplant before it was like,

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
ah, fuck.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
Fuck me.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
I should have waited.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
I should have waited.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
That would have been a fucking great name for this thing.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
This is way better.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
This is way more like an egg.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Fuck.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
I'm going to call this, I'm changing this one.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Guys, these are called sick pumpkins now

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
and eggplant says avocados.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Here's a question.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I live on the edge of a forest

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
and there have been cougar sightings in the area recently.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Cool.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Ask them out on a date.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Oh, like the animal.

44:38.000 --> 44:43.000
Yeah, that's why we, that's the stuff with the intros again.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
Oh, okay.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Remember, we got to think about-

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Got it, got it, got it.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I was thinking of cougar as a sexy older lady.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Yeah, no, for sure.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
And your response to that was they live in the forest

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
and you should go ask them out on a dinner date.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Well, why else would you call them cougars

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
if they don't live in the forest?

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Umpire.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
I thought the ball would be lower, which is why I swang lower

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
and I just missed it entirely.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
That was the situation there.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Oh, so this is football.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
I clearly was misdirected by the goalie.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Yeah, the pitcher tricked me

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
because he did his body in a different way

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
than I thought I would hit it pretty hard, actually.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
So I'm going to, you know what?

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Let me take the double and we'll just call it-

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Don't worry, I can't run.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
I'm not making it the third.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Yeah.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
So there's cougars in the forest.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
You've completely, you've ruined me.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
I want to make sure there are no cougars nearby

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
before I let my dog out in the backyard.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
I have been told the best way to scare them off

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
is to speak loudly as they will not approach humans

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
if they know we're nearby.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
My question is, what exactly should I say

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
that will deter cougars,

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
but won't make my neighbors think I've lost my mind

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
when I say it loudly alone in my backyard?

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
That's from Matt in Vancouver.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
He, him.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Okay, Matt.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Any cougars out here?

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Okay, cougars, get out.

46:01.000 --> 46:06.000
I can't think of anything else.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
This is, this question is going to be a no from me

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
on a couple-

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Just holistically?

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Just holistically for a couple reasons.

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
One, there is nothing you can shout out of your windows

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
that your neighbors will hear and say, oh, it's okay.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
There's no, you can shout,

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
I'm yelling to scare cougars away.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
And then your neighbors will hear like, oh, that's-

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
What if it's just like,

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
soup's on, Hezekiah, come in from the fields.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
But then they're going to know that one, no fields.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Two, no Hezekiah.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Yeah.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
That's a good point though.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
And on the flip side,

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
what if one of the cougars' name's Hezekiah

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
and they hear that and they say,

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
hmm, a good dog treat for me.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
Thug soup, can't wait.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
What if he just yelled out the window,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
does anyone want to talk about the latest episode

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
of WandaVision?

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
And then people are going to be like,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
oh, this is nice in the virtual age.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Someone still wants to talk face to face.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
But then what if a cougar's watching WandaVision?

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
What if then they are?

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
It's gotta be an important neighborhood announcement.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
Something like, hey, I'm going to be so eliminated tomorrow

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
if anybody wants to get some,

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
I'll have it outside my house.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Get your quarters ready.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
You might have to follow through on that though.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Oh, that's a problem.

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
Does it have to be talking

47:23.000 --> 47:27.000
or will singing also scare the cougars?

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
I would think singing would be even more scary.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Yeah, I would think so too.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
And maybe this is why barbershop quartets are a thing.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
No, okay.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
There's no way a barbershop quartet

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
is going to scare away a cougar.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
I mean, I was thinking maybe like metal or like,

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
but if it's a soothing thing,

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
that cougar's going to be like, well, now hold on.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Well, no, I'm sorry, Travis.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
It's going to be a shitty barbershop quartet.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Oh, okay.

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
It's going to be daily auditions for a barbershop quartet.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
It's going to sound like complete shit.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Oh, like it's going to be like four tenors.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
You know what I mean?

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
It's going to be like four tenors

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
who are all coming like, moon over Parma.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
And everyone's like, no, I'm going to do that one.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
And it's so discordant.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Yeah.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Sorry, I had two reasons.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
This was the first one.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
And the second one is that there will be no deterring

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
these cougars from eating whatever they damn well feel like.

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
We live close to nature and we have coyotes.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
And that's not a joke.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
You hear them every night howling,

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
apparently over jubilation,

48:30.000 --> 48:35.000
over some poor animal that they have turned into a meal.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
And you hear that enough times and you think,

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
I hope these guys don't know how to pick locks.

48:41.000 --> 48:46.000
Because if that's, there is nothing but a couple skinny locks

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
keeping me from turning into coyote power.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
This is fair because if a cougar moved into my neighborhood

48:55.000 --> 49:00.000
and then left on my porch like a bag of Wendy's, right?

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
I wouldn't be like, I don't think this Wendy's is for me.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
And so you moved to the cougar's neighborhood

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
and you left a bag of dog on their front porch.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
Your dog is named Wendy, which is confusing.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
The cougar is going to assume that dog was brought there

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
as some kind of peace offering from you

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
who moved into their neighborhood.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
If you want to help protect your dog, Wendy,

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
there is only one thing really that would be useful to yell.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
And it's, hey Wendy, you better get jacked

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
or you're going to get eaten by cougars.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
Wendy, you need to get swole.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
Do some exercises.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
I can't help you.

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
Here's your magic knife that's poison to cougars, Wendy.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Take outside in your teeth.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
Oh yeah, just yell, Wendy, please don't kill another cougar.

49:45.000 --> 49:50.000
Be careful with it, Wendy, it's double poison to dogs.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
Which is a design flaw, admittedly.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
I'm sorry about the knife.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
God, cougars are so big.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
We forget about cougars, don't we?

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
I feel like we've almost never talked,

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
at least it's been a few hundred episodes

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
since we talked about how big cougars are.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
You see lions on TV or whatever and you're like,

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
God, I'm so glad I never have to fuck around

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
with one of those bad boys.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
But cougars are in our backyard.

50:15.000 --> 50:20.000
We're always within screaming distance of a cougar.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Unless you live in the big city.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
It's a mountain lion, right?

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
And it's like somebody named it a mountain lion

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
and someone said, that's too scary.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
I'm going to call it a cougar.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
And it's like, okay, but it's still a lion.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
That's a lion.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
And it's like, no, no, no, it's not a lion.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
It's a cougar.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Hey, can I do another question?

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Yeah, I love that.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
Here's a quick Yahoo that was sent in by Amy.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
Thanks, Amy.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
who I'm going to name Bianca asks,

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
why did it take so long to invent vape pens?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Come on, I could imagine them being invented

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
at least in the late eighties.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
Huh.

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
There's some Monday morning vape inventing going on here.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
No, but I like this idea because there are many things

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
that I can imagine being invented way earlier than they were.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
Right.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
You know?

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Yeah.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
Like cars?

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
Why did it take us so long to figure those out?

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
I can imagine those being invented in like 1500.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
Yeah, we have wheels and boxes.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
So can't believe it took us that long

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
to sort of squish those two concepts together.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
Now, okay, okay, wait, wait.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
To Bianca's point, the eighties,

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
what do we know about the eighties?

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
They were wild.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
I love them.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
I love the eighties.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Vaporwave was the thing.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
It's right there.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
I don't necessarily know that the vaporwave aesthetic

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
really peaked in the eighties or even existed in the eighties.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
Okay.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
I know what you're saying.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
If they could have figured out a way to vape cocaine,

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
I think it probably would have happened in the eighties.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
They probably would have gotten that done.

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
I think we were clearly smoking

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
and there was lots of digital technology at that time.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
Yeah.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
Cell phones, pagers.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Car phones.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Car phones.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
And I can't believe somebody wasn't like smoking

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
while using their car phone and thinking like,

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
what if the car phone was the smoking?

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
You know what I mean?

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
Which is basically what a vape is.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
Imagine if we could have watched Zach Morris vape

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
in Saved by the Bell.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
If they had invented it in the eighties,

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
we would have had it by the nineties.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
There would have been Ninja Turtle episodes

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
about how bad or cool it was.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
I'm not sure.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
Yeah.

52:32.000 --> 52:38.000
These new truth ads where they show the children

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
and they're battling big dragons made out of scrap metal

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
and it's like, this is vaping.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
Hey guys, could you have made it look a little less radical?

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
Yeah.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Like there's some part, there's got to be some kids out there

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
who are like, I would love to go on an adventure

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
fighting a big metal dragon.

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
Hi, I've got a new pitch for a new truth ad.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
It's going to be some Fortnite characters vaping.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
But who's that?

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
It's a cool youth pastor who shows up

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
and tells them that vaping is bad

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
and then they all eat some apples together.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
Yeah.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
They go and play laser tag with Spider-Man

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
and it's like, is this more vaping or not good?

53:16.000 --> 53:21.000
And it's like, but be careful because vaping makes you lose.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
Okay.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
But it still seems like we had a lot of fun along the way.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
And now they're vaping corn dogs.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
Wait, what?

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Do you know the truth?

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
The real vaping was the laser tag

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
we played along the way with Spider-Man.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
Remember kids, only cool kids vape.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
But then they do maybe later regret it.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
All right, Spider-Man out.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
Hey.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
But maybe they don't.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
I don't know.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
The science is an M, goodbye.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
And red wine's good for your heart.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
Or maybe it's not.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Bye.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
Wait, hey, the Spider-Man message is getting a little muddy

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
with the red wine stuff.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
Did we cut that?

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
No, that was in Spider-Man's contract.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
He feels very passionately about the red wine thing.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
When we went on a great adventure to battle the space monster,

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Thanos, that's a lot like vaping.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Now we won, but maybe you won't.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
But you're going to have a lot of stories to tell, won't you?

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Science is out, folks.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Listen, I got to go.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
Don't call me again.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
I'm really busy.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Is it better than smoking?

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Who the fuck knows?

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Is it better than smoking?

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Probably.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
Is it better than breathing?

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
Absolutely.

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
You know, when my friend the Hulk wants to chill out, he vapes.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
There it is, Hulk vape.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
I vape.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
We all vape.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
But we are metahumans.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Would it affect you the same way?

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
I don't know.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
The science isn't in yet.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
Reed is working on it.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
Yes, Dr. Reed Richards is working on the effects of vaping.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Are there more important things he could be working on?

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
We don't know.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
We don't actually know, because it could be so bad.

55:01.000 --> 55:07.000
But also, what a lot of people won't tell you and your mom won't tell you is it could be good.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
The science isn't in yet.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
This is my new character, Rip.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
And he vaped a radioactive vape.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
And now he has super vape powers.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
And we don't know if this is incur- is he a villain?

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
Is he a good guy?

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
We don't know yet.

55:22.000 --> 55:30.000
All I know is that when I got bit by that big magic spider, it made all the vape damage to my lungs instantly go away in a second.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
So there's a way out.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
There's a way out of this.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Don't let the doctors tell you there's no cure.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
There is.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
There is.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Big magic tarantula.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
Hey folks, thank you so much for listening to our program.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
We very much appreciate you.

55:44.000 --> 55:49.000
And we love you and we're so happy that you have us here with you.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
We have a lot of stuff going on.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
We had to postpone the Adventure Zone live show.

55:54.000 --> 56:01.000
That will be an interactive installment in our Honey Heist series.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
That so far has only been one episode, but it's going to be fun.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
We're doing choose your own adventure stuff.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
We got Eirika Ishii that's going to be on it with us.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
And we had to postpone that.

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
Now it's March 5th, this Friday at 9 p.m. eastern time.

56:14.000 --> 56:19.000
And you can still get tickets for 10 bucks at live.themacroy.family.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
Or if you already purchased tickets, obviously those are still good.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
And if you can't make the show and need a refund for whatever reason,

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
that's at bit.ly slash Taz Refunds.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
It will be available video on demand.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
Of course you'll miss out on the interactive part, but it'll still be there.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Speaking of interactive, just real quick.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Want to mention I started a Twitch channel.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
I'm trying to do it.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
Oh my gosh.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Trying to do it regularly.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
Twitch.tv slash the Travis Macroy.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
Well, I'll have to tune into that.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
See if you got what it takes.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
I think I do.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
I know a lot about Twitch.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
I've been playing some fun games.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
We got a new pin of the month.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
It's sausage to me, which is a fun German phrase.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
And we talked about it on Shwanners.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
And that benefits Feeding Texas, which is the largest hunger relief organization in Texas.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
Currently their network is supporting warming shelters for the unhoused,

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
as well as those without power and water,

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
in addition to replacing perished food and feeding Texans in need.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
So go check that out.

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
We got an empty bullpen designed by Samuel Reardon.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
And a 20 big dog run pin designed by Mel Westphal.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
Check those out and everything else at macroymerch.com.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
Don't forget to pre-order The Adventure Zone Crystal Kingdom,

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
the latest in our graphic novel series.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
That comes out July 13th, 2021.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
That's it.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
That's like literally everything.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
Thank you to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
And hey, let's wrap up.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
Y'all want the final?

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
Yes, please.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Okay.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
The final one was sent in by Amy.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
Thank you, Amy.

57:47.000 --> 57:53.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user PandoraX, who asks,

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
Alcohol, can he go on a pizza?

57:57.000 --> 58:02.000
My name is Justin McElroy.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
May you kiss your dad's square on the lips.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Okay, that was the show.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Hope you had some fun.

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
Go back into the world, face the day ahead.

58:20.000 --> 58:47.000
Please don't tell our grandparents all the cuss words we said.
