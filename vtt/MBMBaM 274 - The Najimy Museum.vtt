the scariest cast member diamond dallas page oh my god bryce dallas howard i'm i'm travesty

01:25.440 --> 01:31.680
mcElroy does that work is that something like travesty yeah i don't think that's a halloween

01:31.680 --> 01:40.240
no like travesty i don't think it's especially halloween i'm uh i'm travis how about ghoul

01:40.240 --> 01:50.480
rat you're just doing a rebus i think ghoul rat fin fins are fins are kind of scary right like

01:50.480 --> 01:57.200
it could be a shark fin mummy roi justin i mean mummy roi would work for any of us wouldn't it

01:57.200 --> 02:05.200
yeah uh what's your name little one it's i think it's ghoul rat fin mummy rat there's a second

02:05.200 --> 02:12.160
rat that's his witness protection identity mr mummy rat uh here's your milk thanks come inside

02:12.160 --> 02:20.080
quick that's not a witness protection work now you have to live here too i can't you know too much

02:20.080 --> 02:26.480
you're not like in hiding mummy rat well that's kind of a weird name god damn it you found me out

02:27.120 --> 02:32.480
not again i wish this was a better disguise i gotta stop witnessing murders around halloween

02:32.480 --> 02:39.680
they have fun there at the police department movie would be about a dracula that witnessed

02:39.680 --> 02:43.600
a murder on halloween and then they put him in witness protection he had to try to blend in

02:44.160 --> 02:48.400
in like a new neighborhood where they couldn't know that he was dracula now here's my question

02:48.400 --> 02:52.320
justin is the fact that he is a dracula completely coincidental or is it connected

02:52.320 --> 02:57.360
to the murder in some way like did he see a wolf man get killed no that's racist travis

02:57.360 --> 03:01.600
that you think you hear dracula and you think oh they probably did a murder no no no i'm not

03:01.600 --> 03:05.920
saying the dracula did the killing i'm saying that he just witnessed another spooky character

03:05.920 --> 03:11.360
like he maybe saw boo berry get killed no no no that this is the best part it was a gangland mob

03:11.360 --> 03:17.360
slaying so now the mob is after dracula and then at the end of the movie he's like well i try to

03:17.360 --> 03:22.160
blend in and play by the rules he's got a cop partner i tried to blend in and play by the rules

03:22.160 --> 03:26.720
but it looks like i'm gonna have to play by the one sorry sorry play by the ghouls yeah i'm gonna

03:26.720 --> 03:32.400
have to play i try to play by the ghouls but now i'm gonna do this one and he puts on uh a big pair

03:32.400 --> 03:39.520
of sunglasses like track style and then the last 15 minutes is dracula murdering um uh an army of

03:39.520 --> 03:44.320

button issue can i hit you guys can i hit you guys with this first of all 420 finally got one

07:48.240 --> 07:55.760
second of all what about just sexy dick and you're just a big dick because it's like

07:55.760 --> 08:01.600
it's gonna be second you're a big dick in like lingerie no no well yeah maybe that is how you

08:01.600 --> 08:06.160
get the idea across although you'd look just silly wouldn't you a little bit not like how

08:06.160 --> 08:11.600
do you sex up a dick like it's already the sexiest you give it a really like like ripped abs

08:12.560 --> 08:19.120
this is a dick with really defined pecs that's not where those go though your your dick don't

08:19.120 --> 08:25.760
have those i'm just talking about a dope hog and how do you like maybe a sash that says world

08:25.760 --> 08:32.320
sexiest dick that's good that's a great costume on the nose but don't put your sexy dick on

08:32.320 --> 08:38.240
anybody's nose how can you be sexy star wars and this one's gonna be also pretty conceptual

08:38.240 --> 08:42.400
because you're not talking about a star specific character but rather i'm not talking about slave

08:42.400 --> 08:48.160
leia i'm not talking about crotchless han i'm talking about sexy star wars they don't talk

08:48.160 --> 08:52.640
about that when he came out of the when he came out of the uh crowd carbonite yeah the carbonite

08:52.640 --> 08:56.880
that they'd frozen his crotch off his dick was well no his crotch was there but the crotch of

08:56.880 --> 09:03.440
his pant was gone and it was just let's just say i shot first during that scene if you know what i

09:03.440 --> 09:08.240
mean do you think that there will be a lot of sexy bernie sanders out there this year you know there's

09:08.240 --> 09:14.160
gonna be a million sexy bernie sanders's i heard that sexy pizza rat costume is already on sale

09:14.160 --> 09:22.480
oh it just sold out no and it's gone and it's stopped being funny damn just missed it should

09:22.480 --> 09:28.400
you eat all the good candy first or save the best for last that comes in from carissa carissa

09:29.120 --> 09:35.360
is this a good idea i don't know we can at least milk it for a little bit i feel like we had very

09:35.360 --> 09:42.000
very different um candy storage ideas yeah like what what was our concept there travis what was

09:42.000 --> 09:48.320
your sort of plan mine was very much um i would hide it away until a mouse found it and then throw

09:48.320 --> 09:54.080
it all away yeah definitely a mouse based economy yeah that was kind of the built-in

09:54.080 --> 09:59.920
expiration date of whether a corner of the bag was gone or not yeah i ended up with a lot of like

10:00.880 --> 10:06.880
uh like the sprees where there's like three in a package you know what i'm talking about

10:06.880 --> 10:11.040
like a little paper package with three sprees and it's almost like what am i gonna do with

10:11.040 --> 10:17.120
like is this even three sprees yeah opening the thing i would end up with like a pillowcase full

10:17.120 --> 10:21.680
of those and just like you can't throw it away because it's it's candy and you're a little kid

10:21.680 --> 10:28.000
you can't just like get candy whenever you want to but also at the same time like oh we're going

10:28.000 --> 10:33.520
anywhere inside me for sure can i read this one because it made me laugh when i read it's from

10:33.520 --> 10:40.000
buick said something like that they said which cursed me with revolting rhythms what does that

10:40.000 --> 10:48.640
mean and how is it cured uh just take some zinc that usually knocks them yeah usually knocks them

10:48.640 --> 10:52.960
right out it will take usually like two or days two or three days for it to be fully flushed out

10:52.960 --> 10:59.600
so sorry you gotta pass a lot james asked this i i will be gone halloween night but i still

10:59.600 --> 11:04.640
want to leave out candy how can i ensure that nobody just steals the whole bowl not how any

11:04.640 --> 11:10.160
of this works if i see a bowl with candy sitting on a stranger's doorstep i'm gonna do one of two

11:10.160 --> 11:17.360
things not touch it because it could be a it could be a an improvised explosive device and i don't

11:17.360 --> 11:24.720
fuck with that and the other thing it could be is that i could i will take all of it now that i'm

11:24.720 --> 11:28.800
an adult looking back at like trigger treating and all the fears where people were like they

11:28.800 --> 11:34.160
might put drugs in the candy now i'm an adult and i realize like who's this person who just has all

11:34.160 --> 11:39.120
these extra drugs lying around that they're gonna waste on kids right it was just like oh yeah i

11:39.120 --> 11:45.040
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on drugs and i'm giving them away and that was hot that

11:45.040 --> 11:52.400
shit was hilarious let's do some heroin to celebrate oh no what what poor forethought on my

11:52.400 --> 11:58.960
part we put our good heroin to those apples that we gave kids damn it well i'm gonna go shave oh

11:58.960 --> 12:05.200
damn it i can't do that either ironically as we learned from super sized me the this whole

12:05.200 --> 12:13.040
time the candy was the poison super sized weed i got a question from brendan i don't get off work

12:13.040 --> 12:18.560
till after 11 on halloween is that officially too late to engage in spookery uh they have a

12:18.560 --> 12:23.440
name for that brendan and it is vandals like you're a hooligan at that point they have another name

12:23.440 --> 12:31.120
for that it is november well no as long as you do something spooky before 11 59 and 59 seconds

12:31.120 --> 12:38.080
but if you're good but then it's basically we're talking about a spooky purge yeah all my favorite

12:38.080 --> 12:43.600
romantic comedies revolve around like a guy just trying to find a girl that he can spook before

12:43.600 --> 12:48.400
midnight just gotta find somebody really sneak up behind him and give him a good scare well he was

12:48.400 --> 12:53.360
cursed and he was told if he didn't spook by midnight spook true love true spook he would die

12:53.360 --> 12:59.120
it's true it is true that did happen that's not a movie that's real it was called true spook that

12:59.120 --> 13:04.400
event in real life well again it wasn't a movie it was a real event that we all refer to as true

13:04.400 --> 13:11.360
spook you remember i read about it on snopes how do i make this is from dr g how do i make glasses

13:11.360 --> 13:17.440
work with my costume i don't have contacts you gotta play through the pain baby i know this

13:17.440 --> 13:22.320
feels i know how this works because i i have a beard and as a bearded man you either have the

13:22.320 --> 13:28.640
option to like choose a costume that is spectacled or you are you know wolverine but with glasses

13:28.640 --> 13:33.040
you know what i mean you're you're dumbledore but with oh you're nerdy wolverine yeah oh i'm

13:33.040 --> 13:38.880
just travis i'm a wolverine thing but like everybody's got these things like unless you're

13:38.880 --> 13:46.880
like a super like hot guy or girl you are probably like every halloween costume i think of like am

13:46.880 --> 13:52.880
i gonna go as wolverine no i'm gonna go as husky wolverine like where i want to go is like uh

13:52.880 --> 13:58.880
frankenfurter from rocky horror picture show no i'm gonna go as husky frankenfurter like it you

13:58.880 --> 14:05.440
gotta people have to know that it's just it's just for laughs you know in the end in the end

14:06.720 --> 14:11.920
it's not though it's serious it's serious i met um i met a couple of my neighbors last night and

14:11.920 --> 14:17.040
they invited um a few of us to their halloween party and like last night was the first time i

14:17.040 --> 14:21.600
met them and this will be the second time i see them and they i imagine they're gonna go hard i

14:21.600 --> 14:26.880
don't know how hard they're gonna be and it's it's very stressful this idea of costume like

14:27.520 --> 14:32.640
competition the original plan is we're going to drive in and we're gonna go see hocus pocus

14:32.640 --> 14:37.600
driving you don't need a costume at the drive-in but now unless you want to cosplay as one of the

14:37.600 --> 14:44.800
sisters hocus or yeah i mean check check my mean the sanderson sisters check sorry my nijimi out

14:44.800 --> 14:51.360
check my nijimi out i said hey everybody come coming around check my nijimi out you know i

14:51.360 --> 14:55.680
didn't think i'd get a lot of use for this full body nijimi costume but it is really paid off

14:55.680 --> 15:01.600
i used it for that bank robbery and then i haven't touched it since she was so nice when she did the

15:01.600 --> 15:08.960
full nude cast for me so patient it took me two or three tries she's a wonderful actress she

15:08.960 --> 15:14.080
she genuinely is a wonderful actress and she can stand very still for long periods of time

15:14.080 --> 15:20.160
which is very important she can play a witch she is transformative yeah the weird thing about it is

15:20.160 --> 15:26.480
that after she lost some weight um she was nice enough to come back and uh oh she's done several

15:26.480 --> 15:30.160
several casts for me yes am i nice enough to come back and take another cast i mean she was kind of

15:30.160 --> 15:34.400
insistent yeah yeah like she didn't want me to run around without hey griffin this is she said

15:34.400 --> 15:40.160
peek nijimi yo g this is your girl nijimster and i just want to let you know i dropped a few lbs

15:40.160 --> 15:45.920

several different jimmy's like it like nijimi comes to my house maybe it's like especially warm

16:12.320 --> 16:18.000
and that's where she's decided to do her annual molting it's it's a real horror show

16:19.520 --> 16:23.760
what halloween costumes did you have high hopes for that turned out terrible that's from jake

16:23.760 --> 16:31.760
oh i don't have these i uh well last year rachel and i did bob and lynda belcher uh and so did

16:31.760 --> 16:35.840
travis and teresa and so did our friend bradberry and liz and uh i don't know how it worked for you

16:35.840 --> 16:41.200
guys but nobody recognized us outside of a single uh trio of friends we ran into at a bar who dressed

16:41.200 --> 16:45.600
up like bob and lynda and there was jean there dressed up as bee squash that shit was dope but

16:45.600 --> 16:50.080
otherwise nobody like i i i was on a bad streak there of putting a lot of effort in costumes and

16:50.080 --> 16:54.480
getting absolutely no recognition which is why we do it i showed up one year to a party and

16:54.480 --> 16:58.960
did some bar hopping as a contestant from legends of the hidden temple and i like bought a blue

16:58.960 --> 17:04.800
barracuda shirt and i had like the gold helmet and the knee pads and everything fucking nobody

17:05.520 --> 17:13.040
nobody zero buddies i i couldn't i most of mine really work um i i'm pretty good at this whole

17:13.040 --> 17:17.520
halloween costume but you can be good at putting together a costume and still not have anybody know

17:17.520 --> 17:23.680
who the fuck you are and best costumes that have ever like succeeded with people going oh my god

17:23.680 --> 17:30.480
i get dexter like in the height of the tv show yeah yeah yeah that that went before it got shitty

17:30.480 --> 17:35.920
and it cost like zero money and then i did done you just you just murdered some people yeah and

17:35.920 --> 17:43.440
i did quail man and it only took me ruining a green sweater i uh when in my mid teens i saw

17:43.440 --> 17:49.760
the indie film six strings samurai but a guy who looked like buddy holly uh traveling around a

17:49.760 --> 17:55.440
wasteland with a sword and a guitar on his back and i thought man that is a cool movie so for

17:55.440 --> 18:00.640

plant cup man that didn't work nope no that wasn't a good you know what the worst part about that was

19:24.640 --> 19:31.440
it was both a bad costume and a bad bit i would have been happy if either one had panned out

19:31.440 --> 19:35.680
i would have been thrilled i'm looking at some tweets right now about being gauzy is there

19:35.680 --> 19:42.320
something there uh here we go it's ben gauzy and i just cover myself with gauze yeah name tag that

19:42.320 --> 19:49.680
says ben yeah that's pretty good uh i got a question from i'm just picking one at random here

19:49.680 --> 19:54.960
you know there's a lot of questions about candy corn a lot of people are really down on candy corn

19:54.960 --> 20:00.560
i just guess i guess i just need to touch in with you guys about candy corn uh what's your what are

20:00.560 --> 20:05.520
your feelings on me personally i don't think it's as bad as everybody makes it out to be you know

20:05.520 --> 20:11.840
sometimes it's kind of it's got a satisfying chew and it's got a waxy quality that i i kind of like

20:11.840 --> 20:16.560
i kind of feel like i'm punishing myself when i eat it and i guess i really like it i think it's a

20:16.560 --> 20:21.680
real chore do you think what do you think is a chore about it travis what's like biting off the

20:21.680 --> 20:26.080
little segments and see if they're different flavors they don't have i did justin and then

20:26.080 --> 20:33.200
i became a man and put away such childish things now i only eat food for sustenance to live to live

20:33.200 --> 20:39.360
and it's candy corn is like eating sugary candles and i don't have time for that shit i eat i eat my

20:39.360 --> 20:44.720
soylent and then i'm back out there working for money none of this is true right i'm just i'm out

20:44.720 --> 20:49.840
there grinding every day so that one day i can retire and pass it on to my kids i don't have time

20:49.840 --> 20:57.200
to eat sugary candles yeah but i i do actually enjoy candy yeah i think they are right i like

20:57.200 --> 21:02.160
the pumpkin and chocolate variants i would like to make my own elton brown taught me how to and

21:02.160 --> 21:08.080
i've just never done it seems like something you don't need to know i mean it's never gonna

21:08.080 --> 21:13.280
come up in a job interview if that's what you mean wait you waste your time which mbmb am classic

21:13.280 --> 21:19.280
goop would make the best costume and that's from the davin porter finally something i care about

21:19.280 --> 21:24.160
classic bits i feel like this is dying out a little bit i feel like maybe we need to pivot

21:24.160 --> 21:29.600
back to our regular it's too late now griffin we're too deep in it i can't even see i can't

21:29.600 --> 21:33.280
see the beginning we just gotta work towards the other end if a trick or treat or ask for

21:33.280 --> 21:40.240
gluten-free and or peanut free can i slam the door on them that's from zach yeah yeah yeah peanut

21:40.240 --> 21:45.360
allergies those aren't a thing hilarious what well they're still little they'll bounce back

21:45.360 --> 21:50.000
from they just have to eat through it and come out the other end okay now wait a minute but okay

21:50.000 --> 21:57.520
but but you don't get you don't get to order like you're not placing an order for halloween candy

please not sperm excellent uh this is from john what's the protocol on touching trick or treaters

22:19.600 --> 22:26.240
as part of my not slash gimmick whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa this is the most this

22:26.240 --> 22:30.720
is the most important advice we're gonna give don't do this thing don't do any of this thing

22:30.720 --> 22:36.320
can we okay no no this is this is the question what costume could this person possibly be wearing

22:36.320 --> 22:42.640
or touching a trick or treater is like you just won't get what the costume is unless they are

22:42.640 --> 22:47.360
touching a trick or treater what's the character from babes in toyland they're like catchy's kids

22:47.360 --> 22:54.960
in a giant night kid getter cake getter what about child spider and it's a spider for children

22:54.960 --> 23:00.080
oh you're a spider no no no watch no look you get it now oh you're a child spider some sort

23:00.080 --> 23:04.480
of child spider i'm guessing yeah you got it maybe you got bozo the clown and you have to

23:04.480 --> 23:10.400
keep redirecting the idiot kids towards the buckets in the grand prize game like no dip

23:10.400 --> 23:14.480
shit it's over there you were so far off i hate you do people still do that where like you have

23:14.480 --> 23:18.960
to like go through the grand prize game on bozo's super sunday show they do not no i mean like a

23:18.960 --> 23:23.200
spooky haunted porch thing to get to that can't like walk through these plastic bags and then you

23:23.200 --> 23:29.360
can have this the candy and it's like man listen this is a simple one in one out transaction i say

23:29.360 --> 23:35.360
trick or treat you hand me the candy i say thank you i leave the porch i leave the porch jonathan's

23:35.360 --> 23:40.160
monster tweeted what's the worst halloween costume related goof slash disaster you've

23:40.160 --> 23:43.920
had oh had i thought i said heard because if it was heard i was gonna say that last question

23:45.360 --> 23:50.160
uh there's a question here from arrogant wanderer who says my friends are celebrating halloween as

23:50.160 --> 23:55.760
couples they're all in relationships and want me to go should i i'm single the answer is absolutely

23:55.760 --> 24:02.240
yes well wait hold on what do you mean they're celebrating as cut like they're just going to

24:02.240 --> 24:06.800
get together in a circle as couples and be like nice like are they going to a party are they going

24:06.800 --> 24:12.720
to a scary movie so what do you mean they're they're probably just going together like to

24:12.720 --> 24:18.800
trick or treat together as couples because you get twice the candy as adult couples holding bags

24:18.800 --> 24:23.040
we're adult couples so we could carry all the candy we're hollow tonight high five we don't

24:23.040 --> 24:28.400
even have to go back and switch out bags or nothing i love being married and i love having

24:28.400 --> 24:35.200
a significant other in my life the only thing that is made harder is the costume

24:35.920 --> 24:40.240
yeah thing because it's like there's a lot of things that i come up with are like oh that would

24:40.240 --> 24:43.680
be a killer costume for me because it has to be the right fit you know this has to be something

24:43.680 --> 24:49.920
you can you can live with but it a lot of times it's like really dynamic guy and then so what

24:49.920 --> 24:56.000
i'll just be in a dress or something you know what i mean like or or or the reverse right like

24:56.000 --> 25:02.000
if she dresses as buffy and i'm gonna dress as like what zander i'm gonna wear a hawaiian shirt

25:02.000 --> 25:06.640
like that's i don't i don't have that problem because teresa has been dorothy from the wizard

25:06.640 --> 25:13.200
of oz since she was like six for every halloween that's easy god i wish i had she has a costume

25:13.200 --> 25:19.520
in storage halloween comes it's dorothy time and she puts it away for next year god i wish i

25:19.520 --> 25:23.600
thought to do that yeah fuck i wish i thought because of this one it's just established like

25:23.600 --> 25:27.520
it's not weird right it's just the thing that she does if i try to do that in a couple like i'm an

25:27.520 --> 25:33.840
oddball but if i've been doing it for years it's like my thing yeah oh god that's it's genius um

25:34.560 --> 25:39.680
i want to talk about the question that we addressed for a moment john jonathan's monster

25:39.680 --> 25:43.040
about the worst halloween costume related goof slash disaster you pack because i don't know if

25:43.040 --> 25:47.120
i ever talked about this on the show but the year i lived in chicago me and my roommates like went

25:47.120 --> 25:53.440
around the town we went to a couple parties uh and did it up chicago style baby deep dish

25:54.240 --> 25:59.200
only i put off getting a halloween costume until the day of and so i went to the halloween supply

25:59.200 --> 26:05.280
store next to the trader joe's uh in roscoe village and i rolled up there and it was pretty barren and

26:05.280 --> 26:11.040
the only thing i could find that i enjoyed was the costume from kickass the hit movie kickass

26:11.040 --> 26:16.560
and comic book kickass so i bought it but they didn't have my size they only had a size smaller

26:16.560 --> 26:22.880
than i wore i was like oh that's probably okay that costume is spandex and it was basically

26:24.880 --> 26:26.560
it was basically what it was

26:28.240 --> 26:32.640
so kind of like turned my whole body into like some sort of dick museum

26:36.400 --> 26:41.200
like i was so proud lights highlighting it the glass and like a little placard like donated by

26:41.200 --> 26:47.680
griffin and it basically was just like hey guys how's it going nice to meet you i'm real uncomfortable

26:47.680 --> 26:56.000
and i'm very cold and yeah thanks for asking that is my dick so um i went to a party uh the first

26:56.000 --> 27:01.520
party we went to and i checked out the situation and i never checked out your situation yeah it

27:01.520 --> 27:06.480
was a bad situation so fortunately i reached into the backpack that i had the foresight to bring in

27:06.480 --> 27:13.040
case that i did not feel confident enough to pull this bold look off and i went in their bathroom

27:13.040 --> 27:19.200
and i put jeans on underneath the costume and then i just looked like a weirdly dumpy legged kickass

27:21.520 --> 27:27.200
it was bad bad beat griff it was a bad beat it was a bad beat and a bad year and the costume cost me

27:27.200 --> 27:34.640
like 60 dollars last year teresa and i worked uh in a haunted house that uh was in a very rich

27:34.640 --> 27:39.200
family's garage there's this company that like basically comes in and they throw big halloween

27:39.200 --> 27:48.720
parties and they build like really um let's say uh you know thrown together how uh haunted houses

27:48.720 --> 27:55.600
in people's garages and uh teresa and i were scaring in it and uh an eight-year-old ballerina

27:55.600 --> 28:00.640
came out walked out to me i jumped out oh she looked at me looked at me and reached up and

28:00.640 --> 28:06.480
smacked me real hard in the face fuck yeah and then i had to like go up to my boss and complain

28:06.480 --> 28:11.520
about the eight-year-old ballerina that hit me in the face and how i didn't want to do it anymore

28:11.520 --> 28:15.760
is it because you didn't scare her good enough no well it was like her eighth time through i

28:15.760 --> 28:21.040
think you know she'd seen it she'd been she'd been around she knows how where the scares are

28:21.040 --> 28:27.360
ah i love that punk shit that's dope i mean don't hit obviously that's like that's rule number one

28:27.360 --> 28:32.080
for me just like in life guys if you listen seriously don't hit but that shit rules well

28:32.080 --> 28:37.120
it's already demoralizing enough to be the person scaring in a haunted house because it's just like

28:37.120 --> 28:42.880
you you like have it's not i don't know what type of person does it and feels rewarded though i

28:42.880 --> 28:48.560
imagine there are those people but i do it and i'm just like ugh i know like best case scenario i

28:48.560 --> 28:53.200
just scared the shit out of someone worst case scenario i jumped out and went and they just

28:53.200 --> 28:58.000
looked at me and walked past like there's not a good feeling that can occur unless you scare

28:58.000 --> 29:03.200
someone and they go oh thank you thank you for that i feel alive for the first time wonderful

29:03.200 --> 29:07.760
spooking that was real top-notch spooking only now do i appreciate the things in life that have

29:07.760 --> 29:13.040
been empty to me before now thank you you've made me realize how precious this thing we call life is

29:13.040 --> 29:19.360
i can now love great i can love for the first time i must go talk to my ex-wife sydney won't

29:19.360 --> 29:25.040
let me put up any spooky decorations like anything that looks really scary like i found a hand that

29:25.040 --> 29:32.960
i wanted that had a sign in its hand that's like here's your sign it says bill ingvall zombie zombie

29:32.960 --> 29:39.200

29:46.080 --> 29:52.480
the rifle together as we speak goodbye wait wait wait wait wait this is important what is it that

29:52.480 --> 29:58.080
in the context of this that you are going to go do that you have to go do and he just he just hung

29:58.080 --> 30:06.720
up i think he's gone it's too late now it would be very unfortunate if the trigger phrase for him to

30:06.720 --> 30:13.280
go kill bill ingvall was kill ingvall that's a little on the nose little on the little bit on

30:13.280 --> 30:19.600
the nose actually good man sherry and candidate two is not very good no no the code word was like

30:19.600 --> 30:23.840
you just had to work assassinate the president into a sentence and then if they heard it watch

30:23.840 --> 30:30.000

still going and doing his thing justin yeah are you going to are you gonna uh take charlie trick

30:35.840 --> 30:40.640

teeth of a wolf banana but two of the sharp teeth are longer like a dracula okay and then he does

34:47.040 --> 34:52.320
have some bandages but those are just covering wounds they're not like his clothes he has other

34:52.320 --> 34:59.920
regular clothes on and if you see him it's too late once you see him you've initiated the bond

34:59.920 --> 35:08.080
is he sexy he can be depends on what you're into huh i can't tell i can't and also it depends on

35:08.080 --> 35:12.480
like what he's wearing and like how he's done his hair and if he's like been taking care of himself

35:12.480 --> 35:19.040
you can't discount confidence that's so right right now i'm wearing like a shitty polo right

35:19.040 --> 35:23.200
now and some old jeans because i need to do laundry as soon as we're done like i i'm a little

35:23.200 --> 35:27.200
greasy because my fans turned off in the room like i'm not sexy right now can i get sexy sure

35:27.200 --> 35:30.880
and the same as you know you're right i didn't mean to pass it like pass it as just a blanket

35:30.880 --> 35:36.000
statement does he have the capacity to appear sexy yeah of course feels like everyone everyone

35:36.000 --> 35:42.080
does everyone does you know that's such a good point griffin yeah what does he do to uh teens

35:42.080 --> 35:48.080
if he kept well i told i told you well you you see him he forms the bond once the bond is formed

35:48.080 --> 35:55.360
it's unbroken until one of the two of you dies or until thursday rolls around on thursday it resets

35:55.360 --> 36:00.000
thursday next or like because like it is like the coming thursday or it's it's the shitty thing

36:00.000 --> 36:05.040
right trav if you get bonded on thursday you've got to wait until the next thursday oh that's

36:05.040 --> 36:09.760
that's weak that's the worst but if it's like wednesday night like if it's wednesday and you

36:09.760 --> 36:14.400
get and there's this uh death man like knock on the door um which is just like a regular knock

36:14.400 --> 36:19.600
but there's a lot of whaling then go you can open it because like you do only have like a few hours

36:19.600 --> 36:25.200
so you're gonna have to deal with this fucking guy but do it before it turns midnight or like it's a

36:25.200 --> 36:29.520
whole thing but watch out if he touches you don't let him touch don't let him what happens if he

36:29.520 --> 36:36.560
touches you oh boy you are in for it like what what happens don't leave me a suspense well you're

36:36.560 --> 36:44.800
gonna start getting thinner oh no wait like like an unsettlingly thinner like the movie thinner

36:44.800 --> 36:49.440
no not that fast but you are going to lose a little bit of weight but then after but then

36:49.440 --> 36:53.520
like so far after the cycle you're gonna regain that weight you're gonna be back to the normal

36:53.520 --> 36:57.840
weight that you were so frustrating it's really very very frustrating because you just went out

36:57.840 --> 37:01.680
and bought those new pants for yourself that you liked so much guess what you got to return those

37:01.680 --> 37:04.880
and while you're on your way back to the gap to return those pants you get hit by a truck and die

37:04.880 --> 37:11.360
oh no no what a twist that's how that's how death man gets you one of the interesting things about

37:11.360 --> 37:16.880
death man is that i thought when you said his name uh which i recall correctly is death man

37:16.880 --> 37:21.600
yeah he would like like his touch would like kill you like it would kill you to touch him it does

37:21.600 --> 37:27.040
it was but like very indirect it's very like final destination stuff it is if if the final

37:27.040 --> 37:32.880
destination of every death in the movie was like guys we gotta stop returning these pants

37:32.880 --> 37:37.440
just to eat the loss okay no i hey mom i thought you said we were heading home oh yeah i just

37:37.440 --> 37:41.360
remember we had to return the jeans at the gap no they don't even give you cash to give you

37:41.360 --> 37:50.320
store credit yeah that's as good as cash idiot um anyway uh that was a good bit and the next

37:50.320 --> 37:53.840
middle see if we can get something good out of this i want to tell you guys about oh shit i've

37:53.840 --> 37:59.120

have done and not only that but this is a new thing that i noticed uh just from being a customer

39:40.400 --> 39:45.760
that they've started to offer more and more like child's friendly options not that anything they

39:45.760 --> 39:50.720
had before i thought was like a child would hate this but you know maybe you got a little bit more

39:50.720 --> 39:56.000
of a picky eater you want something they have that now yeah like they're doing it they're covering it

dot com slash my brother seriously let's change the game it's real good stuff uh you will not

40:19.920 --> 40:27.680
regret it this next message is for future jazz and the message is from past jazz so it didn't ship

40:27.680 --> 40:32.320
did it we both knew that was a possibility you did everything in your power to make it happen

40:32.320 --> 40:37.680
cheer up just remember it's on them so rock out and remember the only thing you can control is

40:37.680 --> 40:45.040
if your job is done on time what do you think this is uh probably organ transplant stuff oh

40:45.040 --> 40:52.080
my god high stakes yeah listen i don't jazz don't play i thought maybe it was jace like short for

40:52.080 --> 40:58.320
jason well maybe that's that's because you don't know jazz right i think maybe jace it's not it's

40:58.320 --> 41:06.080
jazz short for jasmine okay maybe jazz is like a game developer and like their game didn't ship

41:06.080 --> 41:10.400
on time that would be a hell of a thing what if it's oh what if it's about taxes

41:11.600 --> 41:17.920
and what does that mean like she like she didn't send just didn't send like the taxes in on time

41:17.920 --> 41:23.440
and now the government is hunting jazz across this great land of ours and the irony is is that as

41:23.440 --> 41:29.440
jazz uses like our highway system and goes to the national parks to hide like jazz is using all of

41:29.440 --> 41:36.240
the things that jazz's taxes aren't paying for as it's on you how ironic um here's another message

why not get two wands and then you and your lady can both do magic quest that's a great it's a

43:18.960 --> 43:23.840
great as opposed to just making your weight in the car that's really fucked up and maybe the first

43:23.840 --> 43:27.280
time because you want to scout it out yourself before like you do because what if it's not fun

43:28.560 --> 43:32.320

was really really hard on death man he's had a tough time you know who he was married to who

44:07.600 --> 44:13.280
dracula whoa whoa really yeah and so i think that there's maybe like a little bit of chip

on his shoulder because everybody knows dracula i'm biz and i'm teresa and we host one bad mother

44:22.000 --> 44:26.880

44:38.000 --> 44:49.600
maximum fun.org i want to make a point okay we said we're gonna split this right now there would

44:49.600 --> 44:57.840
be absolutely nothing crazier than an episode of this program if it's 50 minutes of halloween content

44:57.840 --> 45:04.880
and 10 minutes of non-halloween content for i guess for non-observers to try to make it like a

45:04.880 --> 45:11.200
pan religious thing oh don't worry we have a non-halloween option that's just it's weird

45:11.200 --> 45:19.440
it's weird way to the back can i change a yahoo to be halloween themed oh this okay this one's

45:19.440 --> 45:23.760
about fear perfect how about this this one was sent in by zoe kinsky thank you zoe climbing

45:23.760 --> 45:34.320
that ladder it's by yahoo answers user anonymous they ask um charm jarmel charm moosh charm moosh

45:34.320 --> 45:41.760
asks silly irrational fears and how to overcome them i can't remember when i first found out about

45:41.760 --> 45:46.080
this fear but it feels like i've been suffering from it for years it was rational it would be

45:46.080 --> 45:52.160
okay but it's far from rational uh basically i'm absolutely terrified such disturbed repulsed by the

45:52.160 --> 45:59.520
extinct shark called megalodon nope not great whites or any living shark just a long dead fish

46:00.080 --> 46:04.240
it wasn't a huge problem as i could avoid seeing hearing anything about the creature pretty easily

46:04.240 --> 46:09.120
that is until i went to south carolina and there was a skeleton recast there and that was enough

46:09.120 --> 46:13.200
to get me to weeping my friends even after explaining it to them found this hilarious and

46:13.200 --> 46:19.760
have since been sending me funny megalodon pictures anyway they can despite it frightening the hell

46:19.760 --> 46:25.200
out of me uh they say it's a stupid fear and i need grow up and i know they are right but that

46:25.200 --> 46:29.440
doesn't stop the hysterics the panic the tears the nightmares how can i overcome this i feel like the

46:29.440 --> 46:36.800
more exposure i get to the extinct animal the more hypersensitive i become i okay i the the fact

46:36.800 --> 46:43.200
that you encountered a megalodon uh-huh even though you know you have a paralyzing fear of

46:43.200 --> 46:50.240
megalodons is insane do you know how easy it is to avoid megalodon related content just check on

46:50.240 --> 46:56.560
yelp and look where it says megalodon statue yes or no yes or no and then if it says yes just don't

46:56.560 --> 47:03.360
go there and also can i say real gold star friends when they see you weeping at the site and they're

47:03.360 --> 47:08.800
like let's send her some photos looks like you found a glowing weak point it's this giant old

47:08.800 --> 47:18.080
ass fish wow guys if i saw somebody weeping at the skeleton of a megalodon i would laugh

47:18.080 --> 47:24.480
like a misinformed racist man at the don rickles show like i i the only way you can turn that is

47:24.480 --> 47:29.200
like somebody comes up to you are you crying you go yeah i'm just sad they're all gone such a sad

47:29.200 --> 47:33.680
story beautiful beautiful great monstrous beautiful creatures this beautiful beautiful

47:33.680 --> 47:38.720
lovecraftian hell monster oh if only i just wonder what it would have been like if i could have met

47:38.720 --> 47:44.560
him while they were alive can i can i devil's advocate here real quick i fucking get it imagine

47:44.560 --> 47:48.560
being a caveman person or something you're swimming in the ocean having a beach party

47:49.280 --> 47:54.880
you see one of those things as soon as you see one of those things it's you're done their mouths

47:54.880 --> 48:00.080
are their mouths are so big i just want to jump in and say that caveman beach party usa is already

48:00.080 --> 48:05.600
copyrighted by my copyright and mailed it to myself death man cave caveman beach party and

48:05.600 --> 48:10.160
the other thing that we said we're going to copyright dracula cop all definitely definitely

48:10.160 --> 48:16.080
copy written biteless protection program that's probably what oh nice that was under the cover of

48:16.080 --> 48:21.440
night what did you hear when i said bite let's protect no no i'm giving you a tackling that's

48:21.440 --> 48:28.400
the tagline okay undercover of night is the tagline well you guys did the title and tagline

48:28.400 --> 48:33.920
so i guess i'll just do the whole script the tagline is he's wearing a cape behind the drapes

48:33.920 --> 48:41.040
biteless protection program colon colon undercover of night he's like peeking through

48:41.040 --> 48:46.880
the drapes oh and his partner's name is night with a k this is a good movie can we get can

48:46.880 --> 48:52.480
we get a plot line in there about how he's recently divorced from death man yes we can

48:52.480 --> 48:59.360
griffin crossover hit of the summer and also and also deadpool is there yeah is megalodon

49:00.960 --> 49:04.640
they were just king shit of fuck mountain huh like i'm trying to imagine that way he's gonna

49:04.640 --> 49:08.880
step to him like we're at the top of the food chain right but a shark will still eat our ass

49:08.880 --> 49:14.720
because if we get careless for like a second well if we do if we do anything seal like right um

49:14.720 --> 49:22.320
um nothing can eat a megalodon except a bigger megalodon okay but still a megalodon um super

49:22.320 --> 49:28.000
megalodon were they just on top of shit were they just sort of rule how did how did they go extinct

49:28.000 --> 49:34.720
that's the ultimate carelessness they they just became whales well i don't think that's just sort

49:34.720 --> 49:42.160
of scientifically sound i think the more logical thing is that they they thought it was so sweet

49:42.160 --> 49:48.880
when they ate stuff that because it was that they ate too much stuff oh we're stuff to eat

49:48.880 --> 49:54.640
you know what i mean they created so did yeah well i got that they got they got the megalobetes

50:00.880 --> 50:02.320
hi i'm killford brimley

50:04.720 --> 50:11.200

50:11.200 --> 50:16.800
oh fuck that's good it's real um can i do another yahoo since i didn't get to do any

50:16.800 --> 50:23.360
the whole show as long as it's like spooky yeah this one's spooky uh bats are pretty spooky right

50:23.360 --> 50:28.240
yeah sure yeah yeah that's good okay this one was sent in by uh game recognized game rachel

50:28.240 --> 50:34.320
spurling thank you rachel it's by yahoo answers user mother green who asks

50:34.320 --> 50:39.200
what would batman think of marijuana would he look down on people who use it

50:40.640 --> 50:46.320
this is like a random question that popped in my head also i'm bull boo word nice um good

50:46.320 --> 50:51.200
like what would he think of people with anxiety using it or any other medical condition

50:52.160 --> 50:54.960
adds a really interesting twist there because at first you hear the question you're like

50:56.000 --> 51:00.240
i don't know if he likes to party or not this is a tough question but then he adds another layer

51:00.240 --> 51:07.360
of what if you needed it what if it was medical herb riddle me this batman what do you think of

51:07.360 --> 51:14.000
that dank herb but for medical use i think it all depends on what else you're doing like that's a

51:14.000 --> 51:22.640
good answer man marijuana seems like a low-hanging fruit but if the penguin's like i wear this this

51:22.640 --> 51:28.080
monocle for my glaucoma like and he also smokes pot i think he's going to go with that i don't

51:28.080 --> 51:33.360
also smoke spot i think he's going to try to bust oh i thought he will probably add it to the list

51:33.360 --> 51:39.120
of charges oh i see i see what you're saying if he runs into the penguin he's smoking that big fat
