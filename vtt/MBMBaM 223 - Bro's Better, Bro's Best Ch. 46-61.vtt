00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.000 --> 00:49.200
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and my brother me an advice show from the modern era.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.960
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.600
And I'm your baby brother Griffin McElroy.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.440
Hi Griffin, you sound great.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.160
Thanks!

00:58.160 --> 00:59.840
You sound like you're in Japan.

00:59.840 --> 01:00.640
I'm a muppet.

01:01.280 --> 01:08.800
Well, Griffin, uh, uh, why don't you keep it down? Let your brother and I, uh, talk.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.400
Just pipe down there, buddy.

01:10.400 --> 01:10.900
Okay!

01:11.520 --> 01:14.800
Griffin's in Japan, so he's not here, but we do have a fresh-

01:14.800 --> 01:19.840
we didn't want to leave you hanging, so we got a fresh episode of Old Things for you.

01:19.840 --> 01:23.520
It's fresh in sequence, I guess, so it's got that going for it.

01:23.520 --> 01:26.800
This is our spooktacular best of Halloween episode.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.880
It's terrifying how little effort they put into it.

01:30.880 --> 01:34.320
No, it's actually terrifying the old bits we used to do.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.520
It's the- it is actually horrifying how much work-

01:37.520 --> 01:41.760
how much more work it takes to put together, uh, one of these episodes

01:41.760 --> 01:43.600
versus just blathering on for an hour.

01:43.600 --> 01:47.040
And I had to listen to all the old monthly observances.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.800
Real quick before we get into it, though, we got some fun news for you.

01:53.680 --> 02:00.720
We're going to be doing a- we've got six live shows booked before April-

02:00.720 --> 02:02.880
or the end of April 2015.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.160
There's a lot coming.

02:04.800 --> 02:09.840
We got our first one, though, to announce to you, our beloved listeners,

02:09.840 --> 02:14.400
is My Brother, My Brother, Me, Home for the Candle Nights, a holiday spectacular,

02:16.400 --> 02:18.960
live from Huntington, West Virginia, our hometown.

02:20.480 --> 02:20.880
Travis.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.560
West Virginia, here's the thing.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.800
West Virginia, it's closer than you think.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.200
That's actually the state motto.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.080
Closer than you think.

02:28.080 --> 02:28.800
West Virginia.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.000
We have been talking about doing a show like this for a long time.

02:32.720 --> 02:36.000
We have no idea if anyone from Huntington will come.

02:36.000 --> 02:36.960
We think they will.

02:36.960 --> 02:43.040
Well, some of them, but we're counting on you folks to come in and hang out with us.

02:45.120 --> 02:49.440
We're doing the show on December 21st at 7 p.m. at City Hall.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.400
Tickets will go on sale Monday.

02:52.400 --> 02:59.120
That's today at noon at MBMBAMCandleNights.BrownPaperTickets.com.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.240
So if you want to get tickets for that-

03:02.800 --> 03:03.680
They're only $15.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.840
Yeah, they're 15 bucks.

03:05.840 --> 03:10.960
It's going to be, we're going to avoid cursing, because it's a Candle Nights episode,

03:11.840 --> 03:13.360
shooting for like PG-13.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.080
You know, like we're going to try to avoid like the super bad words.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.880
But hopefully it's something that the whole family can enjoy.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.760
We have actually talked about-

03:23.760 --> 03:26.160
Actually, I came up with this idea last night and I haven't asked you, Travis,

03:26.160 --> 03:30.960
but I think we should have, my brother and me, family breakfast the day after

03:30.960 --> 03:35.440
at Flapjack's to Napa, Huntington's finest combination breakfast and Mexican restaurant.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.120
Well, how does one say no to that?

03:37.120 --> 03:38.000
Yeah, you can't.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.360
You can't say no to it.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.560
It'll be fun.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.360
Sawbones, the medical history podcast I do with my wife, Sydney,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.080
will be opening for my brother and me.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.920
So you're going to get a Sawbone show.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.000
Our dad will be there.

03:51.280 --> 03:54.480
I really think this is going to be like a one of a kind Huntington experience.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.880
If you've ever been to Huntington, this is going to be your best.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.800
This is going to be your best.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.320
And it is not a rural town.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.680
It is a suburban area.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.640
There are many hotels for you to choose from.

04:06.640 --> 04:10.240
There are many fine restaurants, which we will be happy to make recommendations for.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.720
You should visit Pullman Square.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.840
Pullman Square.

04:13.840 --> 04:14.880
You can do some shopping.

04:15.840 --> 04:20.240
There's lots to do in Huntington, but the main thing you're going to want to do

04:20.960 --> 04:24.880
is you're going to want to visit us for our holiday.

04:24.880 --> 04:25.600
Spectacular.

04:26.480 --> 04:27.200
Family friendly.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.000
But not like little kids.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.720
They won't like it probably, but it's family friendly, I guess.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.640
Let's hear like PG, PG-13.

04:34.640 --> 04:35.440
PG-13.

04:35.440 --> 04:41.520
But NBNBAMCandleLights.BrownPaperTickets.com is going to be the show at Huntington City Hall.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.200
7 p.m. Tickets are 15 bucks.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.200
It's going to be a hoot.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.080
A hoot nanny.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.280
I think it'll be a hoot.

04:47.280 --> 04:48.320
So make the trip.

04:48.960 --> 04:49.600
Come on down.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.080
Visit us.

04:50.080 --> 04:50.480
Hang out.

04:50.480 --> 04:54.080
It's going to be, you know, it's going to be nice because we're going to be on our home turf

04:54.080 --> 04:57.600
and you'll get to meet a lot of people that we know and hang out.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.160
It'll be fun.

04:58.160 --> 05:01.520
Okay, so with that being said, hit.

05:01.520 --> 05:06.080
Welcome, my brother, my brother and me, where Travis has suggested we lead off the show

05:06.080 --> 05:08.560
by mentioning the release of Thor.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.200
That's his high energy opening.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.240
Did you guys see Thor?

05:12.240 --> 05:14.000
Hey, did you guys hear about Thor?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.280
He's got this hammer thing.

05:15.280 --> 05:15.920
A hammer?

05:15.920 --> 05:17.200
Did you guys see Thor?

05:17.200 --> 05:20.400
Yeah, he's like the Prince of Asgard or something.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.360
Thor watch.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.240
What's your cinch?

05:24.240 --> 05:25.920
Thor watch 2011, Griffin.

05:25.920 --> 05:26.880
How many...

05:26.880 --> 05:29.760
The countdown is over.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.280
The countdown is over.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.400
I saw Thor.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.560
There's a Thor signing up my Trader Joe's.

05:35.200 --> 05:38.320
He's picking up some soft pretzel bread for Loki.

05:40.320 --> 05:44.560
Thor watch 2011 is an advice show for the modern era.

05:44.560 --> 05:47.280
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.920
I'm Travis McElroy.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.520
I'm Griffin McElroy.

05:51.520 --> 05:52.640
This is not a gag.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.480
I said, what should we lead the show off with?

05:54.480 --> 05:57.520
And Travis says, Thor came out.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.000
All right.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.840
What else happened this week that's worth noting?

06:02.800 --> 06:03.600
Thor.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.100
Yep.

06:07.760 --> 06:12.640
So as I mentioned, this is an advice show for the modern era and a Thor watch.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.200
It's not a play a thing.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.440
It's nautically themed.

06:19.440 --> 06:23.520
Justin, can I tell you as somebody who on a weekly basis scours Yahoo!

06:23.520 --> 06:27.440
Answers for things that are funny, there is every kind of play that you can imagine.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.200
There's just no kind of play that is out of that.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.960
I've been trying to find a way to talk about it on the show.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.320
You guys know about age play?

06:35.200 --> 06:36.080
Excuse me?

06:36.080 --> 06:37.680
It's called age play.

06:38.640 --> 06:39.920
I couldn't find a funny Yahoo!

06:39.920 --> 06:42.560
Answer about it because they're all just so crushing.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.880
But it's where one person pretends to be a baby.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.720
Oh, look at him.

06:48.720 --> 06:53.360
Okay, but now they pretend to be like a senior citizen at a nursing home.

06:53.360 --> 06:53.920
You can.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.000
You can do that.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.160
The world is your oyster in the world of age play.

06:58.720 --> 07:01.280
Fuck, you just got into the movies for $5.50.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.000
That's so hot.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.800
Tell me about that early bird special.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.640
We're eating dinner at 4 p.m.

07:06.640 --> 07:07.360
God, I'm a wreck.

07:08.080 --> 07:12.480
Do you think that there are people that are like hardcore like goth enthusiasts or steam

07:12.480 --> 07:17.120
punks or something and their idea of this kind of sex play is like you put on a suit

07:17.120 --> 07:20.640
and you carry a briefcase and like you talk about spreadsheets?

07:20.640 --> 07:22.240
They call it they call it norming it up.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.440
It's norm.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.320
Norm play.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.200
I'm going to norm you tonight.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.120
Tonight, let's just listen.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.320
We're having casserole.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.640
I want to plan the perfect evening.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.680
Ah, we're gonna drink bed wine.

07:33.680 --> 07:36.560
First, I want to light some candles.

07:36.560 --> 07:37.840
We bought it back from Body Works.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.080
And then I want to put on-

07:40.080 --> 07:41.200
What's that on the TV?

07:41.200 --> 07:42.960
Oh my God, it's a Becker marathon.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.920
I want to put on that Mad Men soundtrack we bought at Target.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.080
Just go crazy.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.000
Well, go restrained on you.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
And when that's done, I got Colby Callie lined up.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.360
It's next on iTunes.

07:58.160 --> 08:01.680
I'll open your delicate mouth and feed you some Oreos.

08:03.280 --> 08:04.480
Can you imagine?

08:04.480 --> 08:05.840
Goth people can't eat Oreos?

08:06.640 --> 08:08.240
Goth people can't eat Oreos.

08:08.240 --> 08:08.480
Why not?

08:08.480 --> 08:09.840
They only like blood cookies.

08:13.120 --> 08:13.760
That's true.

08:14.480 --> 08:15.360
From Toll House.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.720
Those are delicious though.

08:16.720 --> 08:21.120
Mm-hmm, those Keebler elf commercials are fucked up though.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.800
Keebler elf, come into the tree.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.120
And I'll survive it.

08:27.120 --> 08:27.840
Put a baby in.

08:30.800 --> 08:31.840
Elk and blood cookies.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.320
Introduce fat blood cookies.

08:34.320 --> 08:34.880
Don't ask.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.840
Hey, let's get into the questions.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.480
My girlfriend and I have been dating for seven months now.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.880
And we enjoy going out to eat every once in a while.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.640
The thing is, when we order the food,

08:48.640 --> 08:52.160
she takes it upon herself to order both her food and my food.

08:52.160 --> 08:56.160
At first it was kind of cute, but now it's really starting to bother me.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.840
Should I say something to her about it?

08:57.840 --> 09:00.240
Or is this one of those things I need to let go?

09:00.240 --> 09:02.000
Flustered in Florida.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.400
Wow, that's so weird.

09:04.400 --> 09:04.560
Yeah.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.440
I've never heard of that.

09:05.440 --> 09:08.480
That's not a thing that people actually do, unless they're in like a movie.

09:08.480 --> 09:16.640
Well, what if when she ordered your food, you just screamed, wrong, close, but not right.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.720
Let's go with a steak.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.880
We were looking for steak.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.360
Maybe she really knows him really well.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.360
I would actually be a big fan of this.

09:25.360 --> 09:28.960
I hate deciding what to eat at a restaurant because I don't understand the big words.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.160
Like, what's a gru year?

09:30.720 --> 09:32.000
What's a gru year?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.320
I think he probably like picks the food.

09:34.320 --> 09:40.720
I just think that like when the lady comes around, that she says like, he told me earlier

09:40.720 --> 09:44.720
that he wanted to have the steak and gru year, so I'm going to order that for him.

09:45.680 --> 09:51.280
Maybe or maybe like really mean and she thinks like he's overweight and doesn't want to say

09:51.280 --> 09:51.920
anything about it.

09:51.920 --> 09:55.120
So she's like really passive aggressive, like he'll have a salad.

09:55.120 --> 10:00.320
Yeah, I'll have the chicken corn on blue and Tubby Tubbs over there is going to have a

10:00.320 --> 10:03.040
shot of wheat grass and some disapproving looks.

10:03.040 --> 10:08.080
Somebody skipped his morning jog so he gets a mixed green.

10:09.200 --> 10:16.080
I think that you should probably ask out of curiosity, like very non-aggressive.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.960
Hey, why do you do that?

10:18.960 --> 10:20.800
Why does that happen every time?

10:20.800 --> 10:22.560
Maybe there's a good loving reason for it.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.800
What could the loving reason be?

10:24.800 --> 10:28.560
Maybe you're really bad at like human interaction and she's saving you from having to make a

10:28.560 --> 10:30.080
fool of yourself in front of the waiter.

10:30.080 --> 10:34.400
Like she knows you're going to make terrible jokes about how you want your steak done or

10:34.400 --> 10:34.880
whatever.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.160
Like how do you want your steak cooked?

10:36.160 --> 10:36.880
On the grill.

10:36.880 --> 10:40.000
Yeah, she's trying to prevent that from happening.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.480
My name is Fred and I'll be your customer this evening.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.640
Could you steak me?

10:53.440 --> 10:58.960
The first time you guys went out, did you embarrassingly order things like, I'll have

10:58.960 --> 11:03.760
the hamburger because you hold the mustard and put the mayonnaise in a cup next to it

11:03.760 --> 11:04.720
and stuff like that?

11:04.720 --> 11:06.880
Maybe she just doesn't want to deal with your whininess.

11:06.880 --> 11:10.320
Bring me the mayonnaise in a stein if you could, please.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.280
I need a thimble full of vinaigrette.

11:13.280 --> 11:16.640
If I see a pickle, I'm going to burn this restaurant down.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.440
Sorry, Darlene.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.480
I think you should ask to find out what the reason is.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.560
If it's a good reason, it's not worth it.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.240
Does it really bother you?

11:26.240 --> 11:29.280
What you should do is just completely embrace this.

11:29.280 --> 11:33.840
And when your lady orders for you, make eye contact with the waiter and just give a real

11:33.840 --> 11:34.880
slow nod.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.640
Yeah, like you're inviting him into your-

11:39.680 --> 11:42.400
It feels like you're inviting him into your relationship.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.920
That's another story I'll have.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.440
She was correct.

11:46.640 --> 11:51.440
Why don't you turn it into a contest where you tell her, listen, baby, I don't mind if

11:51.440 --> 11:54.480
you keep ordering for me, but I'm going to order for you.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.680
If I get to the waiter first, I'm ordering for you.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.080
Yeah, well, it doesn't even have to be like that.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.400
You can be like, who knows the other person better?

12:02.400 --> 12:06.480
So like, she'll order something for you and she'll be like, I think he would like the

12:06.480 --> 12:10.160
barbecue bacon onion burger from TGI Fridays.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.280
And then you'll be like, she'll have cookies.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.000
Sir, it's seven o'clock.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.680
I know for a fact she hasn't eaten dinner yet because she's at a TGI Fridays.

12:19.680 --> 12:20.480
I know what I said.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.040
She'll have the cookies, please.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.120
She'll have the cookies, please.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.400
And a bowl of croutons.

12:27.600 --> 12:32.000
I get a bowl of croutons, some of those cocktail swords.

12:32.560 --> 12:36.080
There's one thing about my- I know about my girl and that she's got a big race coming

12:36.080 --> 12:37.600
up and she's gotta carb.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.560
Gotta carb up.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.600
Croutons, please.

12:42.800 --> 12:43.520
Just carb her.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.920
Do you guys know what day it is?

12:49.280 --> 12:50.960
Ah, God damn it.

12:50.960 --> 12:51.200
Yep.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.120
Oh, fuck.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.240
It is May now.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.400
I gotta go down the list though because I didn't pick it.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.240
Oh, good, good.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.640
Teen CEO month.

13:04.000 --> 13:04.640
Oh, God.

13:08.160 --> 13:09.360
Like Bieber, right?

13:09.360 --> 13:10.000
Huh?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.040
Like Bieber?

13:11.040 --> 13:13.680
Like Bieber's the CEO of Bieber Industries?

13:13.680 --> 13:13.920
Yeah.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.840
Where did this company go wrong?

13:18.720 --> 13:20.160
Maybe it was the milkshake machine.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.600
This is mysterious.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.560
React month.

13:24.320 --> 13:24.720
Bang.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.280
What was that?

13:26.960 --> 13:27.360
I don't know.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.080
I'll tell you in May.

13:30.640 --> 13:34.160
National hamburger month, national barbecue month, a lot of food.

13:35.040 --> 13:35.600
I don't know.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.080
I don't know.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.520
I need a whole month for hamburgers.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.560
Like I'm pretty much up on those on the reg.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.200
I made a hamburger last week on a grill.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.040
I'm celebrating national hamburger year.

13:47.040 --> 13:50.480
I'm celebrating national hamburger life.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.240
What about eco driving month?

13:56.240 --> 13:58.960
There's gotta be some tips, gotta be some tips and tricks.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.200
Guys, you might have to dip into the weekly observances.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.440
Please don't, Christ.

14:05.920 --> 14:06.960
Teen CEO month.

14:07.920 --> 14:08.720
Let's do it.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.880
Let's help spread awareness.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.920
Did you know that May 8th through 14th is national-

14:13.920 --> 14:17.200
uh, salute to moms 35 plus week?

14:18.320 --> 14:18.800
What?

14:18.800 --> 14:22.640
Did you know that May 9th through the 13th is national etiquette week?

14:23.280 --> 14:23.680
I don't-

14:23.680 --> 14:24.960
I can't do these weeks with you.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.240
I'm going to be straight with you guys.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.960
This entire time as you've been talking about the weeks and everything,

14:28.960 --> 14:32.320
I have in fact been picturing teen CEOs

14:32.320 --> 14:36.480
and like Mr. Brad rolling in to the boardroom on a skateboard and saying like,

14:36.480 --> 14:38.080
now there's a skateboard room.

14:38.080 --> 14:38.880
Let's do teen-

14:38.880 --> 14:39.760
Teen CEO month.

14:40.640 --> 14:41.520
Mr. Brad?

14:41.520 --> 14:44.400
Mr. Brad? Yeah, because that's what he has everyone call him.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.320
He's like, Mr. Johnson's my father.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.360
Call me Mr. Brad.

14:49.120 --> 14:49.680
Let's start.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.560
Let's start.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.280
Okay.

14:51.280 --> 14:52.080
I already started.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.640
Okay, but in the form of a PSA, please.

14:55.920 --> 14:56.240
Okay.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.640
Hey, hey, teen CEOs.

15:00.640 --> 15:03.360
They're just like regular CEOs, only shorter.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.280
My brother, my brother.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.280
Teen CEOs.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.520
Teen CEOs.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.520
They'll get dumped and lay off the whole mailroom.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.240
Teen CEOs.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.880
As long as your CFOs are grown up, this should be okay.

15:22.720 --> 15:23.760
Teen CEOs.

15:23.760 --> 15:26.480
Because an adult would want to run everything his way.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.360
My brother, my brother.

15:28.240 --> 15:31.600
That one is specific to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, by the way.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.880
Teen CEOs.

15:32.880 --> 15:40.080
Good luck sleeping your way to the top, felon.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.680
Can I just talk more about Mr. Brad?

15:43.520 --> 15:47.520
Tired of Shaggy songs not being pumped into your office 24 hours a day?

15:47.520 --> 15:48.720
Try a teen CEO.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.480
He loves that shorty one.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.480
I wish I had more modern references to dip into.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.720
Shaggy is the most modern you can go?

15:58.080 --> 16:01.360
Shaggy is about as modern as I could go in terms of music.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.840
If you want to hear more Limp Bizkit, try a teen CEO.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.080
Is there one called Disco Panic?

16:08.880 --> 16:11.280
Is that an outfit that the kids are listening to?

16:11.280 --> 16:14.960
Yeah, that is a pop punk outfit.

16:14.960 --> 16:20.800
All right, so you want to hear more Disco Panic pumped into your office 24 hours a day?

16:20.800 --> 16:25.040
If you want to hear more brown-eyed peas, try a teen CEO.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.360
Maybe they'll get Fergie to come do some motivational work.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.040
That would be inspiring, I think.

16:31.040 --> 16:34.160
How about Will.i.am come and help everybody get their group back?

16:34.160 --> 16:34.720
How about this?

16:37.920 --> 16:43.520
Teen CEO, profits are down 15%, but angst is up by 20.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.000
I cut expenses just to feel.

16:53.040 --> 16:53.920
Oh, shit.

16:53.920 --> 16:54.560
Try again.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.160
Try to save the last minute.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.200
Make this bit worth it.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.880
We're not too not familiar.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.920
I have a jingle that goes just like this.

17:03.920 --> 17:04.960
Gotta mash them up.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.240
This is a mashup.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.520
I'm trying to lead you in here.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.080
I want to give you one more time.

17:08.080 --> 17:09.040
Here's a mashup.

17:09.760 --> 17:10.400
Girl talk.

17:21.600 --> 17:22.100
Shit.

17:22.100 --> 17:31.140
The lion in Tweed is a friend indeed, and he's also a podcast too.

17:35.140 --> 17:36.020
Shit, no, fuck.

17:36.020 --> 17:36.500
Lost it.

17:37.220 --> 17:38.100
All right, that's a good start.

17:38.100 --> 17:38.820
Here we go.

17:38.820 --> 17:47.140
The lion in Tweed is a friend indeed, and he's also a podcast too.

17:47.140 --> 17:56.020
And a lion in time is a fine feline, but don't let him devour you.

17:59.540 --> 18:00.900
I gotta do something on Media Lab.

18:06.340 --> 18:14.500
I made a Photoshop with me and my best friend Michael Jordan.

18:14.500 --> 18:24.580
Actually, it was me and Michael Jordan and the cast of Space Jam.

18:25.220 --> 18:27.700
It was called Me and Space Jam.

18:28.420 --> 18:29.380
I gotta do another verse.

18:30.740 --> 18:32.180
Second verse, we actually talked about the shit.

18:32.180 --> 18:33.780
Didn't even mention a thing.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.500
All right, here we go.

18:34.500 --> 18:51.780
I took me and Space Jam and I turned it into a website using Media Lab's site grinder technology.

18:51.780 --> 19:06.180
You can visit it, visit it, visit it, at griffinspacejam.com.

19:10.180 --> 19:12.180
That was the worst.

19:12.180 --> 19:14.180
For fear of dwelling too long in the buddy zone.

19:14.180 --> 19:15.540
I have done so many-

19:15.540 --> 19:21.140
Griffin, what exactly is the website for?

19:21.140 --> 19:26.420
What are you doing there at Space Jam website?

19:26.420 --> 19:28.900
Oh, is it just for your Space Jam fan fiction?

19:30.020 --> 19:32.340
There's a story about me and Michael Jordan.

19:35.860 --> 19:37.540
Listen, I got on a hot streak.

19:37.540 --> 19:42.820
I was trying to find the exit off of that musical highway and I missed it.

19:42.820 --> 19:46.260
And then I just had to keep going on the Michael Jordan Express.

19:46.980 --> 19:48.500
You had no other choice.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.540
What could you do?

19:49.540 --> 19:53.380
Jesus, oh man, I'm going there right now, griffinspacejam.com.

19:56.820 --> 20:00.260
Where can I hire an elf impersonator for my b-day party?

20:03.700 --> 20:10.180
I am going all out this year and throwing myself a b-day party.

20:10.180 --> 20:11.300
I'm an elf fanatic.

20:13.140 --> 20:14.580
I think we could have assumed.

20:14.580 --> 20:17.220
Yeah, I'm cool on elf.

20:17.220 --> 20:20.660
I'm a minor elf enthusiast.

20:20.660 --> 20:24.260
I bought my three friends three gifts to give me.

20:24.260 --> 20:30.260
An elf lunchbox, an elf alarm clock, and an elf rock star action figure with guitar

20:30.260 --> 20:31.380
and posable arms.

20:32.020 --> 20:33.140
Let it sink in, okay?

20:34.020 --> 20:35.060
Let it sink in.

20:35.060 --> 20:37.140
All I need is an elf impersonator.

20:37.140 --> 20:38.100
Where can I find this?

20:38.100 --> 20:42.660
I would say, first and foremost, you need a few more things than just an elf impersonator.

20:44.020 --> 20:47.300
I can think of 25 things off the top of my head that you need before you need an elf

20:47.300 --> 20:48.020
impersonator.

20:48.020 --> 20:49.940
I'm going to throw out this person has three friends.

20:53.300 --> 20:57.700
Who apparently does not understand her penchant for elf.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.860
They couldn't think, what's Carly all about?

21:01.300 --> 21:02.020
Alf, I think.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.220
That's maybe what you should do.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.940
I'm going to throw out this person who has three friends.

21:05.940 --> 21:09.620
Alf, I think, that's maybe what you should base your gifts on.

21:09.620 --> 21:12.260
So tell me about this birthday party you're taking me to, Danny.

21:12.260 --> 21:13.540
Yeah, it's going to be cool.

21:13.540 --> 21:14.900
The guy's really nice.

21:16.260 --> 21:17.460
There's this one thing.

21:19.460 --> 21:20.660
Just a heads up.

21:20.660 --> 21:21.940
Just a heads up.

21:21.940 --> 21:25.140
If someone brings up Gordon Shumway, just roll with it.

21:27.140 --> 21:28.420
He's a fan.

21:28.980 --> 21:30.100
Welcome to Melmac.

21:31.620 --> 21:32.980
We are not being particularly helpful.

21:33.700 --> 21:34.180
You're right.

21:34.180 --> 21:35.860
Where can they find an elf impersonator?

21:35.860 --> 21:37.060
What's the number one?

21:37.060 --> 21:39.860
Is there an accepted answer from the answer service?

21:39.860 --> 21:40.740
Well, I'm reading up.

21:40.740 --> 21:41.540
I don't know if you can see this.

21:41.540 --> 21:42.740
I'm reading off a piece of paper.

21:42.740 --> 21:44.180
Yeah, I don't have that.

21:44.900 --> 21:46.180
I remember it because I looked it up.

21:46.180 --> 21:46.900
Number one answer.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.620
The midget store.

21:51.380 --> 21:51.860
No, that's it.

21:51.860 --> 21:52.500
No, you guys laugh.

21:52.500 --> 21:57.140
But that's an excellent point because if you get an elf that

21:57.140 --> 22:01.140
is like you get eye to eye with an elf, like he's the height of

22:01.140 --> 22:03.380
a full grown man, like you will.

22:03.380 --> 22:06.100
That's a I can't imagine anything scarier than that in my

22:06.100 --> 22:08.340
mind than a six foot tall out.

22:08.340 --> 22:10.980
You don't think like the whole situation is just terrifying.

22:10.980 --> 22:12.420
I think the whole situation is terrifying in general.

22:12.420 --> 22:15.220
But now you see, I thought this too.

22:15.220 --> 22:19.060
Alf expanded to six feet tall horrifying, but not as horrifying

22:19.060 --> 22:21.700
as that moment when you reach for the punch and you're like,

22:21.700 --> 22:24.500
oh, oh, right there.

22:25.780 --> 22:30.180
There's a whole emporium of oddly sized like 80s sitcom star

22:30.180 --> 22:31.140
impersonators.

22:31.140 --> 22:38.500
Could we make this like a giant Webster, like horrifyingly

22:38.500 --> 22:44.740
gigantic wonders with killing power.

22:44.740 --> 22:47.300
She's a robot, but with killing power.

22:47.300 --> 22:50.180
Yeah, she's basically still cute as a button, but she's nine

22:50.180 --> 22:50.740
feet tall.

22:51.780 --> 22:53.220
She's sweet as pie.

22:53.220 --> 22:55.540
Her arm does spin around to become a machine gun.

22:56.340 --> 22:58.660
She's a darling that she's hooked up to Skynet, but

22:58.660 --> 23:00.180
otherwise a real sweetheart.

23:00.180 --> 23:08.100
I think that like if you are if you are a midget who a little

23:08.100 --> 23:12.020
person who will go to who does birthday parties, if you are

23:12.020 --> 23:13.860
an alpha impersonator, you don't care.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.140
You've got the suit, right?

23:15.140 --> 23:17.140
Like you've got the suit in your house.

23:17.140 --> 23:21.140
There can't be enough of those just rolling around that call

23:21.140 --> 23:21.780
me what you will.

23:21.780 --> 23:23.140
I need the money real bad.

23:24.020 --> 23:26.980
Is this guy going to be able to handle meeting alpha in person?

23:26.980 --> 23:31.780
Is this guy going to be able to handle the pressure like I

23:31.780 --> 23:34.580
could I could I am starstruck.

23:39.380 --> 23:40.260
Let me pause it.

23:40.260 --> 23:41.060
Another question.

23:41.060 --> 23:42.260
Can we just get the real out?

23:42.260 --> 23:42.900
What's he up to?

23:44.180 --> 23:46.020
What is out been in since out?

23:52.180 --> 23:54.020
Oh, fucking stupid off.

23:54.020 --> 23:56.100
He's got to be doing something right somewhere.

23:56.100 --> 23:56.660
There's a clock.

23:56.660 --> 23:58.980
There's a room you could walk into and there would be elves

23:58.980 --> 24:00.020
hanging from the ceiling.

24:00.740 --> 24:01.940
Do you with that reality?

24:01.940 --> 24:04.500
Let's just like dead eyed looking right at you.

24:05.220 --> 24:06.420
We were talking about this.

24:06.980 --> 24:09.060
We were talking about this backstage actually just rapping

24:09.060 --> 24:09.620
about off.

24:11.300 --> 24:15.220
How fucked up is it that Al's real name is Gordon Shumway, but

24:15.220 --> 24:19.940
people still call him out like he told them his real his real

24:19.940 --> 24:20.900
ass name, right?

24:20.900 --> 24:22.580
Like, hi, I'm Gordon Shumway.

24:22.580 --> 24:25.220
That's just that's shorthand bigotry is what that yeah.

24:25.220 --> 24:26.500
Alphys is slave name.

24:27.860 --> 24:28.900
That's what you're saying to me.

24:30.580 --> 24:31.620
I'll edit that out later.

24:33.140 --> 24:33.620
Fuck.

24:37.140 --> 24:38.260
You know, a lot of people don't know this.

24:38.260 --> 24:39.220
LeVar Burton played elf.

24:39.780 --> 24:40.580
That's true.

24:40.580 --> 24:41.380
That's true.

24:41.380 --> 24:42.100
That's true.

24:42.100 --> 24:42.580
You laugh.

24:42.580 --> 24:43.460
It's true.

24:43.460 --> 24:44.660
He's multifaceted.

24:45.700 --> 24:49.220
Not just a blind man, also an extraterrestrial with a real

24:49.220 --> 24:50.340
taste in the world.

24:50.340 --> 24:53.380
Extraterrestrial with a real taste for kitties.

24:58.740 --> 25:02.020
Ladies are like, like mad sexy.

25:02.020 --> 25:03.780
They're like super sexy.

25:03.780 --> 25:04.260
All of them.

25:04.260 --> 25:05.700
A hundred percent guys.

25:05.700 --> 25:10.020
We don't have like, unless I blast my core, like Bradley

25:10.020 --> 25:13.780
Cooper style, unless me and Coop hit up the gym and do some

25:13.780 --> 25:17.300
yoga lattes and blast our pecs and cores, just whale on them.

25:17.300 --> 25:20.420
Or even Bradley Whitford style.

25:20.420 --> 25:21.940
See, that's my jam.

25:21.940 --> 25:23.780
I would take a Bradley Whitford core at this point.

25:23.780 --> 25:24.900
Forever a Whitford.

25:25.860 --> 25:26.740
Maria Cooper.

25:32.180 --> 25:34.180
This one was sent in by Cameron Daigle.

25:35.940 --> 25:38.100
I'm sorry I said his name like that.

25:40.340 --> 25:41.460
Thank you, Cameron Daigle.

25:42.020 --> 25:45.140
It's by Yahoo Answers user Monkey Pot Tree Nut who asks

25:45.140 --> 25:47.700
Pregnant with twins.

25:47.700 --> 25:48.660
Are these good names?

25:50.660 --> 25:51.860
I was thinking of cute.

25:51.860 --> 25:54.580
Wait, can I, can I, can I prognosticate an answer?

25:54.580 --> 25:55.140
Sure.

25:55.140 --> 25:55.700
They are not.

25:57.060 --> 26:00.100
I was thinking, I was thinking of fun and cute names for my

26:00.100 --> 26:01.540
twins, boy and girl.

26:01.540 --> 26:02.340
Heart.

26:02.340 --> 26:04.660
I'm also inspired by a lot of celebrities.

26:04.660 --> 26:06.500
Their children have such unique names.

26:06.500 --> 26:07.780
Anyway, here it goes.

26:07.780 --> 26:10.020
Starting with a girl's name and then a boy's name.

26:10.020 --> 26:15.780
Jam and Ham Smith.

26:19.380 --> 26:20.260
Nice.

26:20.260 --> 26:21.940
Lola and Boba Smith.

26:23.700 --> 26:24.200
Boba?

26:24.820 --> 26:26.900
Sammy and Sammy Smith.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.180
Now hold up.

26:29.300 --> 26:33.300
Sammy S-A-M-I and Sammy S-A-M-M-Y.

26:34.100 --> 26:34.900
Oh, Jesus.

26:36.260 --> 26:37.620
Law and Lee Smith.

26:37.620 --> 26:39.940
That would make, that would make Sophie's Choice really tough,

26:39.940 --> 26:40.580
wouldn't it?

26:40.580 --> 26:41.460
Take Sammy.

26:41.460 --> 26:42.340
You guys work it out.

26:44.340 --> 26:46.740
Can you say Law and Lee?

26:46.740 --> 26:48.020
Law and Lee Smith.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.420
Sugar and Spice Smith.

26:51.060 --> 26:51.620
Oh, God.

26:51.620 --> 26:52.260
That's got my-

26:52.260 --> 26:56.820
Wait, is the boy Sugar and the girl Spice and the boy Spice?

26:56.820 --> 26:57.140
Nope.

26:57.140 --> 26:57.780
You had it right.

26:59.300 --> 27:00.340
Oh, God.

27:00.340 --> 27:00.580
Sylvia-

27:00.580 --> 27:01.620
You know what that boy is?

27:01.620 --> 27:02.660
A teen runaway.

27:02.660 --> 27:06.340
Sylvia and Silvio Smith.

27:09.140 --> 27:11.620
Because they're living in a Shakespeare comedy.

27:11.620 --> 27:13.380
Apple and Pear Smith.

27:13.940 --> 27:14.740
Oh, God.

27:14.740 --> 27:15.860
Which pear is your favorite?

27:15.860 --> 27:16.260
Thanks.

27:19.620 --> 27:20.740
I like apple and pear.

27:20.740 --> 27:25.380
Just like fucking turn your whole family into some big, awful fruit salad.

27:26.420 --> 27:27.540
Big stupid-

27:27.540 --> 27:31.380
Just a big dumb compote.

27:31.380 --> 27:35.700
Did my boys in the Yahoo Answers crew, did they have any votes?

27:36.820 --> 27:39.380
Yahoo Answers user, you know you love me, said,

27:39.380 --> 27:40.340
great for dogs.

27:41.140 --> 27:42.420
How's your burn?

27:42.420 --> 27:43.300
Hey, check your face.

27:43.300 --> 27:44.180
It's on the ground.

27:46.180 --> 27:49.380
I just rammed your face to the deep fat fryer because it burned so bad.

27:49.380 --> 27:50.420
I burned you so hard.

27:51.220 --> 27:51.860
Pretty good one.

27:52.740 --> 27:53.460
Pretty good zinger.

27:54.020 --> 27:58.340
Okay, someone said jam is an adorable name for a little girl.

27:58.900 --> 27:59.700
No, it's not.

27:59.700 --> 28:00.340
Nope.

28:00.340 --> 28:04.580
Hey, I take you as my bride, jam.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.260
Excuse me?

28:06.260 --> 28:07.380
Hi, I'm jam.

28:08.180 --> 28:08.820
Hi.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.820
That is a fucking power play.

28:10.820 --> 28:12.420
Oh, jam.

28:12.420 --> 28:13.220
What does that mean?

28:13.220 --> 28:16.500
It means that before I was even born, my parents decided they hate me.

28:16.500 --> 28:17.700
They hated me already.

28:18.260 --> 28:20.900
You got legitimate grounds, like mom, dad, you hate me.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.060
Like they, yeah, it seems like it.

28:23.060 --> 28:26.740
Can we come up with some other rhyming couplets for this later?

28:26.740 --> 28:28.020
Sure, sure.

28:28.020 --> 28:31.140
Food based, maybe, since most of these are.

28:31.140 --> 28:34.020
So like, these are my kids, hot and pocket.

28:35.700 --> 28:38.660
What rhymes with would be better off adopted?

28:40.660 --> 28:40.980
Mark.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.940
Mark, that's not quite it.

28:43.940 --> 28:47.860
But what about Julie and Julia?

28:50.100 --> 28:53.060
These are my kids, Susan and Schmoozin.

28:54.420 --> 28:56.420
This is my son, Schmoozin.

28:56.420 --> 28:57.780
I'm very proud of him.

28:57.780 --> 28:58.740
I love him dearly.

28:58.740 --> 29:01.140
What about, can we call him Pepsi and Coke?

29:02.100 --> 29:03.220
Pepsi and Coke.

29:03.220 --> 29:03.700
Pepsi.

29:04.740 --> 29:08.340
Can you choose between my kids in a blind taste test?

29:10.340 --> 29:11.460
What is that, uncle Kevin?

29:11.460 --> 29:12.020
No, thank you.

29:12.020 --> 29:15.700
Can you call one Mountain Dew and one Dr. Pepper?

29:16.420 --> 29:16.900
I'm Dr.

29:16.900 --> 29:19.300
This is their younger sister, Mr. Pim.

29:19.300 --> 29:22.340
I am Dr. Dr. Pepper Smith.

29:22.340 --> 29:23.780
This is my brother, Jam.

29:23.780 --> 29:27.380
This is our poor, this is our poor cousin, Dr.

29:27.380 --> 29:27.860
Thunder.

29:27.860 --> 29:30.500
Just keep having twins until you can fucking

29:31.060 --> 29:34.020
stock a refrigerator with your children.

29:34.020 --> 29:35.060
But don't do that.

29:35.060 --> 29:38.980
I can't, I can't state this strongly enough.

29:38.980 --> 29:40.740
Sweetheart, we ran out of Miracle Whip.

29:41.620 --> 29:43.940
We gotta have a, we gotta have a kid, I guess.

29:43.940 --> 29:44.660
And name him that.

29:45.380 --> 29:46.420
How does this work again?

29:48.740 --> 29:51.060
I don't, I don't understand.

29:51.060 --> 29:52.820
Let's go, let's go, I'm confused.

29:52.820 --> 29:56.500
You name the kid the food, but it's, I'm still hungry after it.

29:59.700 --> 30:03.620
Oh, these, the poor hell, the poor hell that these kids are being born into.

30:04.660 --> 30:05.940
Okay, here's what you need to do.

30:05.940 --> 30:08.180
Whenever you think about what you're going to name your kids,

30:08.180 --> 30:10.900
just set up some practice sentences in your head.

30:10.900 --> 30:14.820
Like, yeah, like, hello, my name is Jam.

30:14.820 --> 30:16.260
Like that, oops.

30:16.260 --> 30:17.860
I would love to work here.

30:18.580 --> 30:19.620
I want to be a doctor.

30:19.620 --> 30:23.060
I'm your Dr. Jam Smith.

30:23.060 --> 30:24.260
I'm Dr. Jam.

30:24.900 --> 30:25.940
This is my partner.

30:25.940 --> 30:26.820
No, I take it back.

30:26.820 --> 30:31.140
Dr. Jam is perfect because you're setting him up to be a professional sports person.

30:31.140 --> 30:32.020
Dr. Jam.

30:32.580 --> 30:34.820
And this, this is my boombox.

30:34.820 --> 30:35.860
He's my resident.

30:35.860 --> 30:37.940
I'm going to cut into you and fix you.

30:37.940 --> 30:38.260
Yeah.

30:38.260 --> 30:41.060
Now, this is my resident boombox and I'm Dr. Jam.

30:41.700 --> 30:42.420
What's wrong?

30:42.420 --> 30:43.940
What, how can I help you today?

30:43.940 --> 30:50.020
I'm in a private practice with Dr. Kreigenstein.

30:50.020 --> 30:50.580
Take it back.

30:50.580 --> 30:51.700
These are awesome names.

30:51.700 --> 30:52.740
Who is that in the corner?

30:52.740 --> 30:53.300
It's Ham.

30:53.300 --> 30:54.340
It's my brother Ham.

30:54.340 --> 30:55.380
He's on the ones and twos.

30:55.380 --> 30:57.060
He's going to mix while I cut in.

31:00.340 --> 31:02.820
Yeah, so I think they're all pretty good.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.740
Griffin, let's do this thing.

31:04.740 --> 31:05.780
What are they short for?

31:05.780 --> 31:06.980
Hamilton and Jamilton.

31:06.980 --> 31:15.940
And our country's 53rd president was, of course, Jamilton P. Smith.

31:20.660 --> 31:21.460
How about a Yahoo?

31:21.460 --> 31:22.260
Because I've got a lot of them.

31:22.260 --> 31:23.140
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

31:23.940 --> 31:24.980
Oh, this will be good.

31:24.980 --> 31:28.340
This one was sent in by Jacob Blocker, who's just the best guy.

31:29.620 --> 31:32.580
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ice Cream Eater, who asks,

31:32.580 --> 31:39.860
should I build a disco playhouse for kids in my backyard?

31:41.380 --> 31:41.860
Yes.

31:43.060 --> 31:44.180
Let me explain.

31:44.180 --> 31:49.700
I had this idea in the back of my head for a while, and I liked a little advice.

31:49.700 --> 31:50.580
And that's what we do here.

31:51.140 --> 31:55.220
I myself was a 70s kid and disco fever never died in my heart.

31:56.100 --> 31:59.860
What if I built a mini studio 54 in my backyard?

31:59.860 --> 32:01.620
What?

32:01.620 --> 32:05.620
I could get a disco ball, a stereo for my old record player,

32:05.620 --> 32:07.780
and a Pixy Stix vending machine.

32:09.300 --> 32:13.700
I'd love to dress my kids up like 70s celebrities like John Travolta,

32:13.700 --> 32:18.580
Barbra Streisand, Mick Jagger, and such, and make them dance and have fun.

32:19.140 --> 32:20.660
Should I go through with the idea?

32:20.660 --> 32:22.180
Hey, you fucking kids.

32:22.180 --> 32:22.980
Hey, you fucking kids.

32:22.980 --> 32:24.580
You don't look like you're having fun.

32:24.580 --> 32:26.420
We're gonna make you have fun, Babs.

32:26.980 --> 32:28.820
I'm gonna make you have fun.

32:28.820 --> 32:30.660
Little Babs, dance with little John.

32:30.660 --> 32:31.060
Have fun.

32:31.060 --> 32:33.220
Do your best, Jagger, because you're Mick Jagger.

32:33.220 --> 32:33.780
Do it.

32:33.780 --> 32:35.300
Snort this Pixy Stix.

32:35.300 --> 32:36.100
Snort it.

32:36.100 --> 32:37.220
That's what he means, right?

32:37.220 --> 32:38.020
My Pixy Stix?

32:38.020 --> 32:38.900
Oh, Christ, yes.

32:38.900 --> 32:42.660
What colors should the inside of the disco playhouse be painted?

32:42.660 --> 32:47.060
Should the disco playhouse have windows or no windows so it's dark inside?

32:47.060 --> 32:50.820
Yeah, I think the color of massive amounts of psychological suffering.

32:51.380 --> 32:52.340
That's really gonna-

32:52.340 --> 32:52.820
Puse?

32:53.540 --> 32:56.100
What color would you paint the inside of the disco playhouse door?

32:56.100 --> 33:00.340
If the disco lights, disco ball is turned on, and me and the kids are dancing,

33:00.340 --> 33:03.380
would it be better to have curtains at the entrance of the disco playhouse

33:03.380 --> 33:06.580
to block out any outside light or no curtains and close the door?

33:07.140 --> 33:07.700
I think-

33:08.900 --> 33:09.940
Holy fucking shit!

33:09.940 --> 33:11.380
Jesus Christ!

33:11.380 --> 33:13.780
Which is the one that keeps Jesus out?

33:13.780 --> 33:15.140
Is that curtains or is that a door?

33:15.140 --> 33:18.820
Cause if he could see, he's gonna kill you instantly and take you to hell.

33:18.820 --> 33:19.380
Himself.

33:19.380 --> 33:20.820
And he doesn't like to go down there.

33:22.100 --> 33:22.600
Wow!

33:23.700 --> 33:24.200
So-

33:24.820 --> 33:25.380
Dog.

33:25.380 --> 33:25.700
You-

33:25.700 --> 33:26.260
Dog!

33:26.260 --> 33:27.940
No, no windows.

33:28.580 --> 33:31.860
No, you owe it to your brood.

33:31.860 --> 33:37.700
Your ruined brood to make sure that their fucking friends, their cohorts,

33:37.700 --> 33:41.860
in elementary school aren't gonna see them dressed up in polyester jumpsuits

33:41.860 --> 33:44.180
and snorting pixie sticks with their dad!

33:44.180 --> 33:44.820
It's too late!

33:44.820 --> 33:45.540
Their dad-

33:45.540 --> 33:46.340
Their dad inside!

33:46.340 --> 33:47.380
You killed him already!

33:48.180 --> 33:51.060
They're dead inside and outside if you let them snort pixie sticks

33:51.060 --> 33:53.940
in a tiny studio 54 you built in your backyard!

33:53.940 --> 33:56.420
Hey, I know I only get you kids on the weekends, but listen.

33:57.700 --> 33:59.700
Listen, look what I've been working on all week.

34:00.660 --> 34:03.940
I've been working on a discotheque for you and your little-

34:03.940 --> 34:05.140
Do your friends want to come?

34:05.140 --> 34:07.700
You want to have your little friends come?

34:07.700 --> 34:08.900
Dad, we're 26.

34:08.900 --> 34:10.660
We're 26 years old, dad.

34:10.660 --> 34:14.340
You know, you know, I heard your friends talking about how much you love the Gap Band

34:14.340 --> 34:18.580
and I was just, oh, that's a conversation that never happened, nor will it ever?

34:18.580 --> 34:20.020
God, I miss the 70s.

34:20.020 --> 34:21.460
Yeah, I miss the 70s too.

34:21.460 --> 34:25.220
Hey, do you guys want to make a wild cherry reunion group?

34:25.220 --> 34:28.660
Like we'll get a little wild cherries is what we'll call it.

34:30.580 --> 34:32.180
Motherfucker.

34:32.180 --> 34:32.740
How?

34:32.740 --> 34:38.020
Okay, no windows, no doors, no walls.

34:38.020 --> 34:38.660
Don't do it.

34:40.340 --> 34:41.140
No problem.

34:41.140 --> 34:42.260
No problem.

34:42.260 --> 34:43.620
You never had-

34:43.620 --> 34:46.820
Listen, I've had some fucking stupid ideas too, okay?

34:46.820 --> 34:47.860
I'm there with you.

34:47.860 --> 34:52.020
Like I've had some ill-advised notions that my wife has had to dispel me of.

34:52.660 --> 34:54.500
I tried to order my own dinner once.

34:54.500 --> 34:56.100
That did not go well, for example.

34:57.460 --> 35:00.100
This, or is it great?

35:00.100 --> 35:05.700
Like I want it to be going on in the world that I live in.

35:05.700 --> 35:08.340
I just don't like the idea of it happening to real people.

35:08.340 --> 35:11.220
Yeah, I don't like the idea of a dad like consulting with his children.

35:11.220 --> 35:12.980
Like, should there be a fuck room?

35:12.980 --> 35:15.460
Like dad, daddy.

35:15.460 --> 35:21.540
Should we just have like a champagne, like a champagne tent maybe?

35:21.540 --> 35:24.180
This is the, this is the stupid slide.

35:24.180 --> 35:25.300
It's cutted in vodka.

35:26.020 --> 35:26.900
Crazy.

35:26.900 --> 35:27.700
Tonight.

35:27.700 --> 35:35.140
I think that you're never too young to indulge in all of your mind and heart's bacchanalian desires.

35:36.340 --> 35:40.500
Unless the only party guests have the same last name as you.

35:41.060 --> 35:43.380
In which case, you're always too young.

35:43.380 --> 35:47.860
It's just gonna be me and the kids partying like it's 1973.

35:47.860 --> 35:48.580
The kids.

35:48.580 --> 35:48.980
No.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.540
The kids punked out at like 10 30.

35:51.540 --> 35:53.860
They went inside and watched Babar.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.700
But I stayed there just twirling.

35:55.700 --> 35:58.020
Just wildly twirling to the sound of Donna Summer.

35:58.020 --> 36:02.420
Hoping that if I spin fast enough, I'll reverse the rotation of the earth

36:02.420 --> 36:06.420
and travel back in time to grown-up Studio 54.

36:06.420 --> 36:07.860
To adult Studio 54.

36:08.980 --> 36:11.780
The one good thing about this is you're really gonna prepare your kids

36:11.780 --> 36:15.060
because for the rest of their life, they can always say,

36:15.060 --> 36:18.420
no matter how sad or weird things get for them,

36:18.420 --> 36:22.500
they can always say it's neither the saddest nor weirdest thing they've ever been a party to.

36:23.460 --> 36:25.860
And when your kid becomes the Bay Harbor Butcher

36:25.860 --> 36:28.660
and they're constantly trying to peel people's faces off,

36:28.660 --> 36:31.620
they have a pretty justifiable reason for why they are that way.

36:31.620 --> 36:35.300
Hey, I just want to say, I don't want to creep you out, but I think you're beautiful.

36:35.300 --> 36:36.900
Can I teach you how to roller skate?

36:36.900 --> 36:42.660
Will you come to Lil 54 with me and let me teach you?

36:42.660 --> 36:43.940
We're going to Lil 54.

36:43.940 --> 36:46.820
I hear Lil Elton John is there playing Lil Crocodile Rock.

36:48.820 --> 36:49.620
The kids love it.

36:49.620 --> 36:51.620
What if it turns out to be really fucking fresh, though?

36:51.620 --> 36:53.380
What if it's dope and every kid wants to get in?

36:53.380 --> 36:56.180
What if it's dope and everyone wants to be your kid's friends because of it?

36:56.180 --> 36:58.180
They have to stand behind a tiny velvet rope

36:59.940 --> 37:02.500
and have sex with the tiny doorman to get in.

37:02.500 --> 37:03.300
Stop it.

37:03.300 --> 37:04.180
That's not good.

37:04.180 --> 37:04.980
You're weirding me out.

37:04.980 --> 37:07.460
That is what will happen.

37:07.460 --> 37:11.860
I haven't seen the movie in there, a movie called Just 54, and it's just like-

37:11.860 --> 37:15.140
Just Mike Myers and Ryan Phillippe.

37:15.140 --> 37:18.100
And they're just fucking in big pits of bubbles all the time,

37:18.100 --> 37:19.460
when the bubbles are made of LSD.

37:20.580 --> 37:22.820
And then three flamingos are there.

37:22.820 --> 37:25.140
What if the dad is the only one that gets coked out

37:25.140 --> 37:29.060
and he just rolls around the dance floor welcoming kids to his party?

37:29.060 --> 37:30.420
Welcome to my party.

37:31.060 --> 37:31.560
Welcome.

37:31.560 --> 37:34.200
Welcome to Little 54.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.160
Michael's over there in the corner if you want to go play with him.

37:39.160 --> 37:41.240
What do you mean I can't get in, Little Bouncer?

37:41.240 --> 37:42.600
I made this place.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.360
I built this out of my own two hands.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.360
I am Little Studio 54.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.680
You can't cut me out, David.

37:50.680 --> 37:54.840
We built this together one weekend, if you remember.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.880
Hey, if this happens, can everybody-

37:57.880 --> 38:01.400
Can we crowdsource this and just say, everybody, go outside,

38:01.960 --> 38:04.040
look in your backyard, look in your neighbor's backyards,

38:04.040 --> 38:07.080
and if you see this, if you see this, can you just call me?

38:07.080 --> 38:08.120
I'll give you my number.

38:08.120 --> 38:08.920
I need to know.

38:09.640 --> 38:13.560
It's been a really rough month, and I could really use this in my life right now.

38:13.560 --> 38:29.240
Can you believe us?

38:29.800 --> 38:31.160
So far, so good.

38:31.160 --> 38:32.600
So far, so great.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.280
Were we ever so young?

38:34.840 --> 38:37.240
A lot of classic bits there for your enjoyment.

38:37.240 --> 38:40.840
We want to take just a second to visit the Money Zone with you

38:40.840 --> 38:41.880
and tell you about Prosper.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.680
Actually, Travis, you tell me about Prosper.

38:44.680 --> 38:46.920
Well, Justin, have you ever tried walking to a bank

38:46.920 --> 38:50.280
and asking for a personal loan to pay off something like credit cards

38:50.280 --> 38:54.520
or home improvement or maybe just start a home business?

38:54.520 --> 38:58.040
I tried to take out a loan for a funny business, I told them.

38:58.040 --> 38:59.000
I got some- And what did they say?

39:00.040 --> 39:01.480
Believe it or not, no.

39:01.480 --> 39:04.120
They said no, those assholes.

39:04.120 --> 39:06.840
Well, there's a better way to borrow money, and it's called Prosper.com.

39:07.960 --> 39:09.400
Basically, think about it like this.

39:09.400 --> 39:12.200
If you have something that maybe is in a regular loan

39:12.200 --> 39:15.480
or even something you would get from a bank, a car loan

39:16.280 --> 39:19.880
or something along those lines, Prosper.com makes it simpler.

39:19.880 --> 39:21.160
You don't have to go to a bank.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.600
They can take care of it for you.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.320
They can also do things like if you have expensive dental work

39:25.320 --> 39:26.840
or a move across the country.

39:26.840 --> 39:29.960
Teresa and I just did that, and Prosper would have helped out a lot

39:29.960 --> 39:32.760
if I had thought about it, but I didn't because I'm a stupid head.

39:32.760 --> 39:37.000
And they can help because basically what it is is a peer-to-peer lending site.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.560
So there are people out there with money to invest,

39:39.560 --> 39:41.960
and there are people out there that need that money.

39:41.960 --> 39:43.560
So this works for both parties.

39:43.560 --> 39:47.080
You can borrow up to $35,000 at a low fixed rate

39:47.080 --> 39:48.920
without ever setting foot in a bank.

39:49.480 --> 39:52.680
And the thing is, you can also borrow smaller amounts anywhere.

39:52.680 --> 39:57.000
I want to say it's from $2,500 to $35,000 depending on your needs.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.680
So if you're sitting out there and you're thinking,

39:58.680 --> 40:01.640
oh, I've got all these student loans and I want to consolidate them.

40:01.640 --> 40:02.280
Okay, great.

40:02.280 --> 40:05.000
Get a loan for that, and then you got one loan payment to make.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.080
If you're sitting there saying, oh, I have to replace the furnace in my house

40:09.080 --> 40:11.240
and it's going to cost $3,000 I don't have.

40:11.240 --> 40:13.400
Maybe you have a medical bill that you can't pay off

40:13.400 --> 40:15.640
and they're not giving you any kind of payment plan.

40:15.640 --> 40:18.920
Go check out prosper.com and I think that they might be able to help you.

40:18.920 --> 40:21.560
You can check your rate instantly without affecting your good credit

40:21.560 --> 40:23.880
by going to prosper.com slash my brother.

40:25.080 --> 40:26.280
Maybe you don't know your credit score.

40:26.280 --> 40:27.720
Maybe you've been afraid to go into a bank

40:27.720 --> 40:29.400
because you think that your credit score is too bad.

40:29.400 --> 40:30.360
Go find out.

40:30.360 --> 40:34.440
And for a limited time, listeners to the show will get a $50 visa gift card

40:34.440 --> 40:35.560
when you get a loan.

40:35.560 --> 40:38.280
So on top of the money you're getting from prosper,

40:38.280 --> 40:40.920
you get another $50 to do with whatever you want.

40:41.720 --> 40:42.920
So that's just free money.

40:43.720 --> 40:45.960
You got to go to prosper.com slash my brother

40:46.600 --> 40:50.360
and you get up to $35,000 in your account in three days

40:50.360 --> 40:52.440
and a $50 visa gift card.

40:52.440 --> 40:54.760
That's prosper.com slash my brother.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.040
Check it out.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.240
Other restrictions apply.

40:57.240 --> 40:59.560
See site for programming visa prepaid card details.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.800
This card is issued by center state bank of Florida

41:01.800 --> 41:05.880
in a pursuant to a license from Visa USA Inc. All personal loans are made by West

41:05.880 --> 41:09.880
Web Bank, a Utah Chartered Industrial Bank member FDIC equal opportunity lender.

41:10.520 --> 41:12.280
Now, Justin, what voice would you say that that was?

41:12.280 --> 41:13.960
That was just like business guy voice.

41:14.520 --> 41:14.840
Now here's my-

41:14.840 --> 41:16.920
I thought it was lazy Patrick Warburton.

41:16.920 --> 41:20.280
Now here's my web guy voice.

41:20.280 --> 41:22.920
My brother, my brother, me is supported by Squarespace

41:22.920 --> 41:25.960
and all on one platform that makes it fast and easy

41:25.960 --> 41:28.760
to create your own professional website or online portfolio.

41:28.760 --> 41:31.640
You don't have to sound like me to create websites.

41:31.640 --> 41:36.520
I understand why you would assume that, but it's not just limited to folks like myself.

41:36.520 --> 41:36.840
Even-

41:36.840 --> 41:40.520
There don't have to be bodybuilders out there that sound like that too, right?

41:40.520 --> 41:46.520
Even you plebeians out there can create a website with Squarespace.

41:47.960 --> 41:51.640
There's support team available 24 seven if you get lost.

41:52.360 --> 41:53.960
It's got responsive design.

41:53.960 --> 41:58.120
So whatever website you make, it's going to look great on your computer,

41:58.120 --> 42:03.080
but also on your phone or on your tablet or whatever on your Google Glass.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.440
Maybe not Google Glass.

42:04.440 --> 42:08.360
I don't actually know about Google Glass, but for just eight bucks a month.

42:09.560 --> 42:17.320
If you've been your second net, if you've been looking for the time to get into web design,

42:17.320 --> 42:21.320

42:22.120 --> 42:23.640

42:42.520 --> 42:43.720
Go check it out you dummy.

42:45.320 --> 42:46.520
Trav, I got a message for you.

42:47.400 --> 42:48.120
For me?

42:48.120 --> 42:48.520
Yeah.

42:48.520 --> 42:54.760
It's well, no, it's from, it's for Adam Calfee and it's from Guy and Gordon.

42:54.760 --> 42:55.320
Okay.

42:55.320 --> 42:55.560
Okay.

42:55.560 --> 42:58.120
And it says to read in a spooky voice.

42:58.120 --> 42:59.640
So I'm going to give it my best shot.

43:00.840 --> 43:03.000
Adam Calfree.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.360
Wait, no, I'm going to stop you right there.

43:04.360 --> 43:06.120
Would you do it in the pallbearer voice?

43:06.120 --> 43:06.360
Okay.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.160
Adam Calfree.

43:09.800 --> 43:10.520
That's right.

43:10.520 --> 43:13.080
We said Adam Calfree.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.880
I actually have to, you can't see this.

43:15.880 --> 43:18.120
I'm actually stroking an invisible urn.

43:18.120 --> 43:19.400
I can't do this.

43:19.400 --> 43:23.720
Does the pallbearer voice, is there some kind of weird stutter that makes you put an R in his name?

43:23.720 --> 43:25.400
No, Calfee.

43:25.400 --> 43:25.640
Okay.

43:25.640 --> 43:26.440
Let me try again.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.200
Adam Calfee.

43:28.200 --> 43:29.080
That's right.

43:29.080 --> 43:30.840
We said Adam Calfee.

43:31.640 --> 43:35.160
This is a birthday wish from Gus and Jordan.

43:35.800 --> 43:43.560
We hope all the spooks, ghouls, and ghosts come out for your big spooky 30th birthday.

43:45.400 --> 43:46.920
It's pretty fucking spooky.

43:46.920 --> 43:53.640
I also like that the message is from Guy and Gordon, but it's also from Gus and Jordan, apparently.

43:53.640 --> 43:56.760
Do you have any other messages?

43:56.760 --> 43:57.240
Yes, we do.

43:57.240 --> 43:58.760
We have a message for Alicia.

43:58.760 --> 44:03.480
This message is from Dan, and Dan says, Hey, Alicia, hope you're having a great day.

44:03.480 --> 44:04.440
See you later.

44:04.440 --> 44:05.000
Love, Dan.

44:05.640 --> 44:07.000
Very cool, Dan.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.520
Very good use of your money, Dan.

44:08.520 --> 44:09.320
Nailed it.

44:09.320 --> 44:10.200
Nailed it, Dan.

44:10.200 --> 44:14.680
Alicia is very, very impressed that you have such disposable income.

44:14.680 --> 44:14.920
Yeah.

44:14.920 --> 44:23.160
Yeah, I don't know if Alicia is your sister, your wife, your imaginary friend, your business

44:23.160 --> 44:24.440
partner, whatever.

44:24.440 --> 44:25.880
Your second life wife.

44:25.880 --> 44:30.600
I think she is going to be won over by that hit message.

44:30.600 --> 44:35.880
So anyway, with that housekeeping business being done, let's get back to the show.

44:35.880 --> 44:39.720
And don't forget, if you want a message on the Jumbotron, just go to MaximumFun.org

44:39.720 --> 44:44.920
forward slash Jumbotron and you too could hear your weird, simple message on our Money Zone.

44:45.560 --> 44:48.200
I said back to the show.

44:52.440 --> 44:56.120
Hey, I like this girl, but I'm afraid to ask her out because we haven't spent a lot of

44:56.120 --> 44:56.600
time together.

44:56.600 --> 45:01.400
However, I'm sure if I wait too long, the whole thing might peter out.

45:01.400 --> 45:02.360
What should I do?

45:02.360 --> 45:03.560
Form spring.

45:03.560 --> 45:06.440
Does he know a guy named Peter that's going to soup his lady?

45:07.640 --> 45:08.280
I don't know.

45:08.280 --> 45:15.480
So 58 episodes in and that's the final answer.

45:15.480 --> 45:21.320
This is where I finally admit that like, I don't get these people that like, sometimes

45:21.320 --> 45:25.560
we get these questions and the answer is so obvious that I think they're fucking with

45:25.560 --> 45:25.880
me.

45:25.880 --> 45:31.240
Like, hey, hey, just ask her, dummy.

45:31.240 --> 45:33.320
Like, just, just, you can't.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.320
If you don't ask her to spend time with you, you can't spend time.

45:37.320 --> 45:38.280
How do you think that happens?

45:38.280 --> 45:43.560
Like, you're not filling up like a giant novelty like thermometer on a donation board.

45:43.560 --> 45:47.480
You don't have to spend X amount of time before you ask her out.

45:47.480 --> 45:50.360
You just like hoping you get stuck in an elevator.

45:51.960 --> 45:53.480
Just ask her to go fucking.

45:54.120 --> 45:55.640
You want to go ice fishing with me?

45:58.200 --> 46:02.280
Hey, I hear there's going to be a tornado warning on Thursday.

46:02.280 --> 46:04.920
Do you want to come to my basement and like, it'll be hilarious.

46:04.920 --> 46:07.160
Do you want to get accidentally stuck in a freezer with me?

46:07.160 --> 46:09.720
So we can recap all the great times we've had together.

46:09.720 --> 46:13.080
Like in that one episode of Perfect Strangers, because then I can ask you out.

46:13.880 --> 46:14.840
Cute meets.

46:14.840 --> 46:16.600
They don't happen in real life.

46:16.600 --> 46:17.720
No, they don't.

46:17.720 --> 46:19.240
They do not happen like that.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.000
Do you know how you spend more time with someone?

46:21.000 --> 46:21.880
You ask them out.

46:22.520 --> 46:23.880
Yeah, just ask them out.

46:24.440 --> 46:25.000
You're ready.

46:25.640 --> 46:27.880
Peter, which I'm assuming is your name.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.360
Oh God, I hope so.

46:30.360 --> 46:33.240
And he uses the phrase Peter out to mean something awesome.

46:33.240 --> 46:36.280
Yeah, he says whenever he leaves the room.

46:37.480 --> 46:38.120
Peter out?

46:39.960 --> 46:40.520
Check this out.

46:40.520 --> 46:41.480
Check this out, Peter.

46:41.480 --> 46:43.160
You wait too long and you die.

46:44.200 --> 46:44.600
Oops.

46:45.560 --> 46:47.160
I could have loved her forever.

46:47.880 --> 46:48.680
Now I can't.

46:48.680 --> 46:50.120
You got any big plans this weekend?

46:50.120 --> 46:50.520
Yeah, man.

46:50.520 --> 46:52.760
I'm going to go to Zaxby's and totally Peter out.

46:53.720 --> 46:55.480
Those people aren't going to know what they saw.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.320
It's going to be heinous in there.

46:57.960 --> 47:00.280
I'm just going to let loose and Peter out.

47:00.280 --> 47:01.160
I'm just going to Peter out.

47:01.160 --> 47:01.720
I've earned it.

47:01.720 --> 47:05.240
I've earned one fucking weekend of petering out.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.800
I think I've sold.

47:07.800 --> 47:09.560
I sold all the shoes at Foot Locker.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.800
I think I can have one weekend of petering out.

47:13.400 --> 47:15.240
I think I think I've earned that.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.400
They can't take that from me.

47:17.400 --> 47:20.360
Hey, hey, hey, you can take as much alimony from me as you want.

47:20.360 --> 47:25.080
You'll never like my my ability to Peter out was not part of the settlement.

47:26.600 --> 47:27.160
Depra.

47:27.160 --> 47:32.360
Can I say something about Tim Allen?

47:34.360 --> 47:36.200
I don't care for the man's comedy.

47:36.200 --> 47:37.160
All right, let's just hold on.

47:37.160 --> 47:37.640
Let's stop.

47:38.520 --> 47:39.960
Let's just do home improvement time.

47:39.960 --> 47:43.000
OK, OK, I want to say something about Tim Allen.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.520
This is a public service message from your friends and my brother and brother me.

47:46.520 --> 47:46.760
OK.

47:48.040 --> 47:49.880
I don't enjoy the man's comedy myself.

47:51.480 --> 47:54.280
But do you realize what kind of a salesman you have to be

47:54.280 --> 47:59.240
to walk in his studio exec's office and say, I'm going to make a show about.

48:00.360 --> 48:04.040
I would make a show about a guy who hosts a home improvement show

48:04.040 --> 48:07.240
and he has a fat bearded friend and a man that lives in a fence.

48:08.360 --> 48:10.600
Could I have a million dollars?

48:10.600 --> 48:12.360
Let's run this for 12 seasons.

48:12.920 --> 48:15.720
I want to run this for it's going to run for 12 years.

48:15.720 --> 48:18.280
It's about a man in a fence and a dwarf.

48:18.280 --> 48:22.200
When you say a dwarf, when you say man in a fence,

48:22.200 --> 48:23.960
he sounds like some sort of fable.

48:25.320 --> 48:26.680
Hi, my name is Wilson.

48:26.680 --> 48:27.480
I'm a fable.

48:28.040 --> 48:29.000
I'm your neighbor.

48:29.000 --> 48:29.800
Here's some wisdom.

48:29.800 --> 48:30.680
He did grant wishes.

48:31.720 --> 48:32.040
Do you guys?

48:32.040 --> 48:36.520
Everybody on that show, they I think they all like sort of simultaneously realized

48:36.520 --> 48:40.600
they weren't going to do any better work and then just kind of just kind of fell off.

48:40.600 --> 48:40.840
Right.

48:41.800 --> 48:44.040
Do you know how many executive producers that show had?

48:45.080 --> 48:46.760
I bet you're going to tell me.

48:46.760 --> 48:48.360
I bet you're going to tell me nine.

48:48.360 --> 48:50.280
That just seems to here's the public service message.

48:50.280 --> 48:53.480
OK, OK, I feel like your life is directionless.

48:54.840 --> 48:57.240
They probably need someone to executive produce some improvement.

48:58.360 --> 48:59.880
When I go over there, put in an app.

49:01.240 --> 49:02.200
There's my brother, right?

49:02.200 --> 49:06.280
That shows been off the air like 13 whole years, but they're still making.

49:06.280 --> 49:07.000
What do these guys do?

49:07.000 --> 49:08.520
I mean, they're still making it.

49:08.520 --> 49:09.240
It's just not being.

49:11.080 --> 49:13.240
We still make home improvement.

49:13.240 --> 49:14.360
You might not see it.

49:14.360 --> 49:16.200
Yeah, it was part of that.

49:16.200 --> 49:18.280
You know how we have a strategic oil reserve?

49:18.280 --> 49:20.520
We have strategic reserve home improvement episodes.

49:22.360 --> 49:24.360
The price of home improvement is so high.

49:24.360 --> 49:25.960
We have got to bring it down.

49:25.960 --> 49:27.560
Somebody send out some VHS is.

49:28.440 --> 49:33.320
Well, ever since the war in Libya started and Muammar Gaddafi started like hoarding

49:33.320 --> 49:37.960
his home improvement, like we've had to start slowly releasing our home improvement

49:37.960 --> 49:38.920
to keep the costs down.

49:39.720 --> 49:42.680
Hey, we don't guess what, Mr.

49:42.680 --> 49:47.960
President, we don't approve of trading young soldiers blood for episodes of home improvement.

49:48.840 --> 49:50.600
Yeah, that is not acceptable.

49:52.600 --> 49:55.240
Do you know how we're going to fix that situation in Libya, though, for real?

49:56.280 --> 49:57.800
Do you know how we're going to how we're going to fix it?

49:57.800 --> 49:59.080
How we're going to air it out?

49:59.080 --> 49:59.720
How Griffin?

50:00.680 --> 50:01.800
Wait, I have a guess.

50:01.800 --> 50:02.300
How?

50:03.400 --> 50:04.040
More power.

50:04.040 --> 50:04.540
Yes.

50:08.440 --> 50:09.080
Here's here.

50:09.080 --> 50:10.360
Let's do some actual PSA.

50:10.360 --> 50:10.860
Yes.

50:12.040 --> 50:14.760
Hey, hey, well, that's not PSA.

50:14.760 --> 50:16.840
Don't start with a third of really that conversation.

50:16.840 --> 50:17.480
We'll do it anyway.

50:18.040 --> 50:23.160
Hey, if you see Zachary Ty Bryan on the street, why don't you give him a buck or two?

50:24.120 --> 50:25.480
He could really use the help.

50:25.480 --> 50:26.200
My brother, my brother.

50:27.800 --> 50:32.440
I know it seems like a good idea at the time, but don't put a V8 engine in a dishwasher.

50:32.440 --> 50:33.640
It only leads to pain.

50:34.200 --> 50:35.320
My brother, my brother and me.

50:35.880 --> 50:38.520
Oh, my brother, my brother.

50:38.520 --> 50:41.880
Richard Karn is swag as fuck.

50:43.080 --> 50:44.120
My brother, my brother and me.

50:46.920 --> 50:50.040
Dude, don't let Richard Karn turn into the next Ray Combs.

50:50.040 --> 50:52.040
Tell him how much you appreciate him today.

50:52.040 --> 50:53.240
My brother, my brother.

50:53.240 --> 50:54.840
Have you hugged a Richard Karn today?

50:55.880 --> 50:57.480
We can't find your keys.

50:57.480 --> 50:58.840
Check Richard Karn's beard.

50:58.840 --> 50:59.640
My brother, my brother.

51:03.480 --> 51:05.000
Did you put my keys up there again?

51:05.640 --> 51:06.200
Dick Karn.

51:06.200 --> 51:12.520
I put my keys in Dick Karn's beard in 1994 and they were never seen again.

51:13.400 --> 51:14.600
That's where we keep the reserves.

51:17.960 --> 51:19.320
Hey, do you want a Yahoo?

51:19.320 --> 51:20.280
Yeah, redeem yourself.

51:21.560 --> 51:23.400
This one was sent in by Andrew Binder.

51:23.400 --> 51:24.280
Thank you, Andrew.

51:24.280 --> 51:27.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user LOL, who asks,

51:29.080 --> 51:32.840
is it normal to be sexually attracted to...

51:33.800 --> 51:34.600
Anybody want to guess?

51:34.600 --> 51:36.760
Yes, I want to guess my answer, no.

51:38.440 --> 51:39.000
Numbers.

51:39.800 --> 51:40.520
Numbers.

51:40.520 --> 51:43.080
Is it okay to be sexually attracted to numbers?

51:43.720 --> 51:45.480
He adds, I admit I am gay.

51:46.040 --> 51:46.760
Well, okay.

51:47.400 --> 51:51.960
But there are some nights where I take the algebra book back into my room

51:51.960 --> 51:53.320
and jack off to the numbers.

51:54.920 --> 51:57.960
Number three is my favorite because it's so sexy.

51:59.320 --> 52:00.360
Well, yeah.

52:00.360 --> 52:01.720
It looks like a sideways butt.

52:02.280 --> 52:02.520
Yeah.

52:02.520 --> 52:03.320
That makes sense.

52:03.320 --> 52:06.360
It adds up or maybe ups like sideways balls.

52:06.360 --> 52:08.040
There's a lot of things that that three could be.

52:08.040 --> 52:09.240
And sideways boobs.

52:09.240 --> 52:10.360
It's not okay.

52:10.360 --> 52:11.240
Three is pretty hot.

52:12.440 --> 52:13.880
Let's break this question down.

52:13.880 --> 52:16.600
The first, my biggest problem with it is that he says,

52:16.600 --> 52:23.320
I admit that I am gay as if that has any bearing on the situation whatsoever.

52:23.960 --> 52:26.520
If you're straight in the numbers, then that's cool.

52:26.520 --> 52:27.240
Yeah.

52:27.240 --> 52:30.120
Or like, is he saying that that's like a side effect?

52:30.120 --> 52:34.680
It's like one out of every 100 people who like people of their same gender

52:34.680 --> 52:36.360
also would like to fuck a number.

52:37.880 --> 52:39.400
What's the sexiest number, everybody?

52:39.960 --> 52:42.920
See this, listen, we're not ready to have that conversation yet.

52:42.920 --> 52:43.960
We'll get to that.

52:43.960 --> 52:46.600
But I think we need to come up with some rules first.

52:46.600 --> 52:47.080
Okay.

52:47.080 --> 52:50.360
Are we talking about fucking the idea of a number?

52:50.360 --> 52:54.600
Are we talking about, I have the important thing is not to fuck anything under 16.

52:54.600 --> 53:00.680
Well, we're not going to think of anything funnier than that.

53:00.680 --> 53:01.160
God damn it.

53:01.160 --> 53:06.280
Are we, but I mean, are we talking about like fucking an actual,

53:06.280 --> 53:09.480
like if we could manifest this number into an actual shape,

53:09.480 --> 53:12.760
which shape would be like the most pleasurable to like rub up against?

53:12.760 --> 53:14.440
Do you have to pick a numeral?

53:14.440 --> 53:17.480
A numeral or cause like there's so many combinations beyond that.

53:17.480 --> 53:19.080
I'm saying what is the hottest numeral.

53:19.880 --> 53:20.680
We have to set a limit.

53:20.680 --> 53:26.200
Cause I could just say like 16,783,492.

53:26.200 --> 53:27.480
And then that's a fucking orgy.

53:27.480 --> 53:28.600
Once you get that number,

53:29.160 --> 53:30.920
let's say between zero and a hundred.

53:31.480 --> 53:36.120
No numeral, a numeral between one zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine.

53:36.120 --> 53:37.560
Oh, I see what you're saying.

53:37.560 --> 53:37.800
Yes.

53:38.360 --> 53:39.000
It's zero.

53:39.640 --> 53:39.960
Nope.

53:40.600 --> 53:41.160
Nope.

53:41.160 --> 53:41.560
You're off.

53:41.560 --> 53:42.840
Zero is mysterious.

53:42.840 --> 53:44.280
Travis, you're a fool.

53:44.280 --> 53:45.480
Justin, do you want to guess?

53:45.480 --> 53:48.200
Well, zero is not bad.

53:48.200 --> 53:50.360
I think seven is the sexiest number.

53:50.360 --> 53:52.600
Travis second guess eight.

53:53.320 --> 53:54.120
Yup.

53:54.120 --> 53:55.640
What's up two holes.

53:55.640 --> 53:56.360
How did you get there?

53:56.360 --> 53:56.920
Two holes.

53:58.920 --> 54:00.840
Which one is down?

54:00.840 --> 54:01.800
Do you want the top?

54:01.800 --> 54:05.080
Do you want that solid, that solid hefty bottom?

54:05.080 --> 54:07.560
Or do you want the narrow, the slightly narrower top?

54:08.520 --> 54:13.720
And also it recalls, it recalls snowmen, which everybody would all agree.

54:14.760 --> 54:15.800
Always hot.

54:15.800 --> 54:18.920
I shouldn't impress my, my feelings on people.

54:18.920 --> 54:23.000
Here's if I were to defend eight, I were to say it's obviously not three.

54:23.640 --> 54:24.200
Right.

54:24.200 --> 54:26.680
Because the three is just half an eight.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.840
You cut it sideways right down the front already.

54:28.840 --> 54:29.400
Sure.

54:29.400 --> 54:32.600
Why have a, why have, you could have two threes already.

54:32.600 --> 54:33.400
It's called an eight.

54:33.400 --> 54:34.200
A number one.

54:34.760 --> 54:36.360
How are you supposed to fuck that?

54:36.360 --> 54:37.240
Really?

54:37.240 --> 54:37.480
Yeah.

54:38.200 --> 54:38.840
Zero.

54:38.840 --> 54:41.000
That cavity is gigantic.

54:41.000 --> 54:41.240
No.

54:41.240 --> 54:41.480
Yeah.

54:41.480 --> 54:43.560
That's just a, you're just begging to feel inadequate.

54:43.560 --> 54:43.960
Two.

54:43.960 --> 54:50.280
I think you could make a case for it's, it's got a nice curvature, which you guys know.

54:50.280 --> 54:51.400
I'm a fan of.

54:51.400 --> 54:51.640
Yeah.

54:51.640 --> 54:52.920
You do like curvatures.

54:52.920 --> 54:58.840
The problem with two and five and seven.

55:00.120 --> 55:00.280
Yeah.

55:00.280 --> 55:00.840
And that's it.

55:00.840 --> 55:01.800
Where, where do you put it?

55:02.680 --> 55:02.920
Yeah.

55:02.920 --> 55:03.880
I see what you're saying.

55:03.880 --> 55:06.040
Where do you have to have intercourse with the numeral?

55:06.040 --> 55:07.000
And that is what we're saying.

55:07.560 --> 55:08.120
Right.

55:08.120 --> 55:12.520
Then a three would be tricky, but I think you could, you could do it.

55:13.080 --> 55:13.320
Yeah.

55:13.320 --> 55:14.040
I think so too.

55:16.600 --> 55:20.520
I would like to know when this person discovered this problem because it,

55:20.520 --> 55:24.440
it could have made for like the most awkward math class ever when he's sitting there and

55:24.440 --> 55:29.080
the teacher's like, say I have 12 apples and I take five away.

55:29.080 --> 55:30.120
What do you have?

55:30.120 --> 55:31.320
And the answer is boner.

55:34.600 --> 55:36.440
Hey, Hey Griff, are there any answers?

55:36.440 --> 55:37.880
Do you want to help him out at all?

55:37.880 --> 55:42.440
Uh, Diana Quimby says, I like 69.

55:42.440 --> 55:45.160
Oh, that's cool.

55:45.160 --> 55:46.440
Nice try, Diana.

55:46.440 --> 55:50.520
Um, so many, so many.

55:50.520 --> 55:52.120
Um, okay.

55:52.120 --> 55:53.240
Says yes.

55:53.240 --> 55:54.200
Completely normal.

55:54.200 --> 55:54.840
Have fun.

55:54.840 --> 55:56.280
You're not hurting anyone.

55:56.280 --> 55:57.000
I disagree.

55:57.560 --> 56:01.320
Now I agree with the second half of that sentence, but let's not throw around

56:01.320 --> 56:03.320
terms like completely completely normal.

56:05.080 --> 56:07.080
Um, you robbed the words of their power.

56:07.080 --> 56:12.280
Yeah, I'm a Gleek says everyone has their quirks, I guess.

56:12.280 --> 56:18.120
So neon Nathan, guess what number Nathan, a number Nathan.

56:18.120 --> 56:19.240
What's up with number Nathan?

56:19.240 --> 56:20.520
He's over there.

56:20.520 --> 56:23.560
He's playing math blaster and he's fucking jerking it.

56:23.560 --> 56:27.960
So right to math blaster number, nookie, Nathan, number, nookie.

56:27.960 --> 56:30.680
Nathan jerks it to math blaster.

56:30.680 --> 56:33.800
I heard on the end, I heard he is the math blaster.

56:33.800 --> 56:37.480
Math blaster is what he announces.

56:37.480 --> 56:38.760
He announces it loudly.

56:41.880 --> 56:45.800
This one was sent in by Metal Gear Jim, which wasn't his Twitter name.

56:45.800 --> 56:47.800
That was his actual name on like on the email.

56:47.800 --> 56:54.840
So maybe it's about Yahoo Answers user, John, who asks, could I take Tyra Banks?

56:57.480 --> 57:00.840
John is five foot five, 130 pounds.

57:00.840 --> 57:02.200
And I don't work out.

57:02.200 --> 57:05.480
My GF just said that I wouldn't have a chance against Tyra.

57:08.680 --> 57:09.800
What's the scrappiness?

57:09.800 --> 57:11.320
Like is his scrappiness?

57:11.320 --> 57:16.840
It doesn't include his power rating or anything like his special abilities or anything like

57:16.840 --> 57:17.000
that.

57:17.000 --> 57:22.760
But I got to say, even if you were about six inches taller and like 20 pounds beefier

57:22.760 --> 57:27.240
and you did work out, have you seen how fierce Tyra Banks is?

57:27.240 --> 57:28.360
And look in her eyes.

57:28.360 --> 57:35.960
Plus, there's just her large like collection of knives that she carries on her person at

57:35.960 --> 57:36.440
all times.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.720
Well, yeah, but we're talking about model.

57:39.720 --> 57:41.480
You're just like hand to hand like.

57:41.480 --> 57:41.880
Yeah.

57:41.880 --> 57:42.120
Yeah.

57:42.120 --> 57:45.320
We're talking about a backstreet brawl.

57:46.120 --> 57:48.440
No chains, no pipes.

57:48.440 --> 57:53.320
Just the fists of a man named John and the fists of a supermodel, Tyra Banks.

57:53.320 --> 57:54.680
Are there any holds barred?

57:54.680 --> 57:57.000
Uh, let me check.

57:59.080 --> 58:00.600
There is one hold barred.

58:00.600 --> 58:00.840
Okay.

58:01.480 --> 58:06.440
You can't say anything mean about her eyelashes because she's actually that's her weak point.

58:06.440 --> 58:07.480
She's really sensitive.

58:07.480 --> 58:12.600
You also can't bring up the time she spent in Paris modeling with her mama going from

58:12.600 --> 58:16.680
agency to agency trying to find someone who will take her under her wing because she gets

58:16.680 --> 58:17.400
very emotional.

58:17.400 --> 58:24.440
She she went through some shit in gay Paris and I think that that hardened her to like

58:24.440 --> 58:27.720
people tell her people tell her she will never Mattel.

58:27.720 --> 58:29.400
I've heard her say that just like that.

58:30.600 --> 58:31.320
Can you translate?

58:31.320 --> 58:33.080
Can you just click Google translation?

58:33.080 --> 58:37.000
I use Google translation said you can't do this.

58:37.000 --> 58:37.880
We don't believe in you.

58:40.040 --> 58:41.880
You have bad eyebrows.

58:41.880 --> 58:42.760
Was that the word?

58:43.880 --> 58:45.160
That's how they say it in Paris.

58:46.040 --> 58:47.960
The eyebrows is about your ease.

58:47.960 --> 58:53.960
Um, listen, John banks will come at you like a fucking Wolverine, not like Wolverine from

58:53.960 --> 58:59.560
X-Men, like a rabid Wolverine and also kind of like Wolverine from X-Men, like both Wolverine

58:59.560 --> 59:03.880
from X-Men and like a rabid fan of Michigan.

59:03.880 --> 59:07.160
But on the bright side, like the next day when you see your friends and they're like,

59:07.160 --> 59:08.680
Oh my God, what happened to you?

59:08.680 --> 59:11.480
You be like, Oh dude, Tyra Banks fucked me up.

59:11.480 --> 59:12.600
She's got reach.

59:12.600 --> 59:16.600
First of all, she's got reach on you because she's a she's a she's a she's a she's a

59:16.600 --> 59:19.160
reach on you because she's a she's a tall, beautiful lady.

59:19.960 --> 59:22.040
Her being beautiful has nothing to do with her reach.

59:22.600 --> 59:26.920
I just wanted to go ahead and put out the opinion that she is, in fact, an attractive

59:26.920 --> 59:27.240
woman.

59:28.040 --> 59:30.360
She's got nails, probably, right?

59:30.360 --> 59:35.240
That's safe to assume they're probably sharp and just fierceness.

59:35.240 --> 59:37.400
We can't stress the fierceness enough.

59:37.400 --> 59:41.080
Yeah, once you're down, once you're down on the ground, bleeding like a bloody heap, she's

59:41.080 --> 59:41.880
not going to stop.

59:41.880 --> 59:43.400
She will literally kill you.

59:43.400 --> 59:46.920
Do you think that he could take Tyra Banks if she were in her fat suit?

59:47.960 --> 59:49.320
Oh, no way.

59:49.320 --> 59:50.280
Are you kidding me?

59:50.280 --> 59:51.880
You could kick her down a flight of stairs.

59:51.880 --> 59:52.760
She wouldn't even notice.

59:52.760 --> 59:54.120
Could you take her in her hobo suit?

59:55.080 --> 59:56.040
Yeah, her hobo suit.

59:56.040 --> 59:56.600
Yes.

59:56.600 --> 01:00:01.240
Tyra also should be noted has a weave, which is basically bionics, right?

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.680
Unfair made integration.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.040
Good news, John.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:04.440
You won.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.560
She got disqualified.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.800
She got disqualified for the use of bionics.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.600
How about a Yahoo answer?

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.080
Yeah, how about this?

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.080
This one was sent in by Gali Ayali.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.040
Thank you, Gali Ayali.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:21.160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Yeti Education Committee.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.840
Do you want to go ahead and imagine what the tone of this question is going to be?

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.040
Somebody finally stepped up and started educating these Yetis.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.280
You dumb fucks.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:39.640
Yahoo Answers user Yeti Education Committee asks, do you think it is possible for Yeti

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.800
to accept Jesus Christ as their savior, or does God not want Yeti in heaven?

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.760
Assume the Yeti speaks English, the language of Jesus.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:51.720
Fuck me.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.080
Fuck.

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.640
Okay, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.400
This question supposes so many things.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:02.040
First of all, do people who not speak English, are they just automatically,

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.480
they just don't get to go to heaven?

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:03.960
Uh-huh.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.600
Okay.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.640
That shouldn't be my main problem with this question, but nope.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.880
It's the first thing that gets sprung to mind.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:15.640
Yetis have souls, I think, but they're like pet souls.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.240
Every rock and tree and creature has a soul.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:23.560
Rocks I'm going to quibble with you on, and probably trees.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.320
All right, well, trees grow.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.520
What kind of trees?

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.400
Not fir trees.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.560
No, fuck fir trees.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.920
Deciduous trees.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.440
Deciduous trees have souls.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.480
Coniferous?

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:34.200
No.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.880
Are you saying you don't want trees in heaven?

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.360
That's what this has to boil down to.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.040
I don't want deciduous trees in heaven.

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.120
God may or may not want Yeti in heaven.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.560
I certainly don't.

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:47.400
What if, like, maybe he lets him into heaven, maybe he doesn't,

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.520
but he starts spreading a rumor that there's some Yetis up there?

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.000
Wouldn't that be a bummer if you got to heaven,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.720
and again, the existence of the Yeti was not confirmed?

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:01.400
It was rumored, like, can you leave giant paw prints in clouds?

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:07.800
All right, if my choices are to be ever tortured by the possibility of Sasquatches,

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:15.560
or to be literally tortured by having my arms torn off by Sasquatches,

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.080
which is their favorite activity,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.640
I would go with the former every time, because I love my arms.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.080
I hug with them.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.880
If you're Kevin's friend, of course, that wouldn't matter so much.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:34.200
It wouldn't be quite so big of a deal, but I'm not acquainted with Kevin.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.080
I like my hugs.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:41.320
The Sasquatch is a mythical creature,

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:45.640
which means that he comes down from heaven whenever he's on earth.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:49.000
Like, if you see him on earth, that means he's vacationing, basically.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.360
The Yeti is an angel?

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:54.280
Yeah, he's down there spreading the word of God in English,

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.600
Jesus' language, to the penguins.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.360
Do you guys know my favorite episode of Touched by an Angel?

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.640
It's the one where the Yeti came down

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.720
and fucking hung out with that Scottish chick.

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.760
Touched by a Yeti.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:07.720
I like the one where Roba Downey-

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.680
Crushed by a Yeti.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.120
I like the one where Roba Downey ripped that dude's arms off.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.680
I'm a Yeti sent by-

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.440
Grrrr!

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:16.840
Ramp.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.960
Give me that arm.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.480
Arms ripped off by an angel.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:26.040
I think the big surprise for this guy is gonna be when he gets to heaven

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.160
and Jesus is a Yeti.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.520
This whole time.

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:31.400
I know you guys were like arguing-

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.680
He speaks Arabic.

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.520
You guys were arguing like, is he white?

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.000
Is he Arabic?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:35.400
What's this?

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.760
Nope, you missed it.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.040
Not even human.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.080
I'm a Yeti.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:39.480
Yeti.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:40.840
Guess what?

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:43.320
The big man, big God, he's a Yeti too.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.320
I'm cutting his image.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:47.880
Pretty much everybody.

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.240
Loki, he was a Yeti.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:49.880
He's a Yeti.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.040
He's up here making tricks and jokes.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.840
Thor is half Yeti.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.440
Thor is half Yeti.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.640
Jim Morrison was a Yeti.

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.840
This whole time he's a Yeti.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.600
Jim Morrison won't be in heaven.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:03.560
Don't be ridiculous.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.440
Jim Belushi, complete Yeti.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.040
Shaved Yeti.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.680
Getty Lee, his actual name is Yeti Lee.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.320
He's not dead yet, but he is a Yeti.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:17.240
Yeah, that's where he gets all his bass groups from, from his Yeti powers.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.360
Bootsy Collins, most basses and bands are Yetis.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:25.960
Most people you see on the streets are Yetis, I would say.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.760
Guys, I have something to tell you.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.320
Yeah, tell me.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.840
I'm a Yeti.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:41.480
That's why I didn't get into heaven, because I'm already like a resident.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:45.320
We've been saving it for the season finale, and this is the twist.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:48.680
Shocking reveal of my true nature.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:53.880
I've got Yeti DNA and skin and like Yeti skin and fur and teeth and stuff.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.600
That person you had at the live show didn't look like a Yeti.

01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:59.480
It's because it wasn't me.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:01.240
What?

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.600
It was an actor?

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.640
It was my familiar.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.080
Every Yeti gets a familiar.

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.440
One human familiar.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:07.960
So that was mine.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.400
His name is Mike.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.280
He's pretty cool, I guess.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:17.240
Yeah, that's just something I hope that you will still let me do the show.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:22.840
Honestly, Griffin, I don't know that I'm comfortable.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:26.760
I think after the summer, we'll leave this as like a cliffhanger.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:32.600
To recap, Griffin told us a Yeti, and we may not let him stay on the show,

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:36.920
and Bernard, our lovable lab tech, was shot in a hold up, and he's in the alley.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.280
We don't know if he's going to live or die.

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.880
He has no arms, but I had nothing to do with that.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.720
Stop trying to pin this on me.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.720
Especially you without arms.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.760
That's impossible.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.480
Could be in so Yetiest, Yeti-phobe.

01:05:54.920 --> 01:06:01.160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Sarah, only it's spelled with like weird characters.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:02.760
I'm not going to get into it.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:12.520
Sarah asks, is my we didn't start the fire continuation decent?

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:14.840
What?

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.520
Okay, like it says, decent.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:21.000
I know it's not good, and some parts don't flow well, but that's okay.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.680
It's supposed to be 1990 through 2009.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:28.280
I don't know a lot about the 1990s, so there's a little lack of that.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.720
Hold on, what universe is this?

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.280
Are you ready?

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.480
Wait, Griffin, you've got to do it to music.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:37.160
You can't not do this to music.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.200
I can do it acapella.

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:39.880
Okay, okay.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:43.160
Then I want you to go back and find the music and play it underneath it for me.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:43.720
Okay.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.440
I don't know.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.320
Okay, I'll try.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:45.560
Okay.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:53.720
Middle East, CSI, Twin Towers, Wi-Fi, eBay, Dan Brown, Sarah Palin,

01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:02.120
global warming, Madonna, internet, marijuana, Obama, Titanic, Harry Potter, organic steroids,

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:07.560
animation, cell phones, immigration, Facebook, Walmart, Google, modern art,

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:13.720
E. coli, bird flu, Michael Jackson, Peter New, Hans Zimmer, Green Day, Guantanamo Bay.

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.720
Oh, God.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:19.640
Hold on.

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:20.920
Did you say Louis Gossett?

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.080
I don't think I said that.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.320
Did I hear E. coli bird poop in there?

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.360
E. coli bird flu.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.200
Bird flu.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:28.600
Bird flu, okay.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:32.040
What was, no, did they say Louis Gossett?

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.120
I don't think they said Louis Gossett.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.320
Can you, can you elucidate the last stanza for me?

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.120
Again?

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:43.720
E. coli bird flu, Michael Jackson, who knew, Hans Zimmer, Green Day, Guantanamo Bay.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.120
What?

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.320
Okay, all right, hold on, hold on.

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.440
Wait, who knew what?

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.160
Who knew what?

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.120
I, I guess that Michael Jackson was gonna die.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.040
And if that is the case, then everybody.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:08:00.360
Okay, I wouldn't, my bigger problem with this is not about the flow of her lyrics,

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:05.160
but more, do we live in a world where this gets updated like the encyclopedia?

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:09.800
Like at the end of a decade, it's like, well, we need to go back and add a couple of stanzas.

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.800
By the end of time, we didn't start the fire.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.240
It's gonna be eight hours long.

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:17.400
Yeah, it's gonna be an epic poem written by poet laureate, Billy Joel.

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:21.560
I'm glad, I'm glad somebody's stepping up here because like, I don't want our school

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:26.360
kids to be like, and then in the year was 1990 and after that there is no more history.

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.600
I mean, Sarah touches on some good points here.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:34.280
I mean, definitely, definitely CSI and Twin Towers and Wi-Fi should all be

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.640
sandwiched together like that.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:39.640
Pretty much, they're pretty much like the same level of stuff, right?

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:43.080
Right, Dan Brown definitely deserves to be remembered forever for his work.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.560
And Hans Zimmer, who knew?

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.560
Wait, Hans Zimmer?

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.520
Yeah, you know.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.480
And Harry Potter's in there?

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.360
Harry Potter's in there.

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:50.840
He's up in the mix?

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:53.160
I'm down with that, that's a revolution.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.800
That's great, Hans Zimmer?

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:04.120
Like, what contribution of Hans Zimmer's are you honoring here?

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:08.520
Like, did you feel, is it, oh, excuse me.

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:12.200
He did the motion picture soundtrack for Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.760
So that makes perfect sense.

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:17.640
He did that OST, so of course you're gonna, yeah.

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.800
I mean, what are we forgetting here?

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:22.280
There's gotta be some other important events.

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.360
Like, Iraq, Afghanistan, something like that.

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:27.080
Or you said Middle East.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.840
Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger's Tides.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:34.120
Iraq, Afghanistan, Pirates of the Caribbean.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:38.680
How about Robert Downey Jr.'s return to the screen?

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.720
That's a pretty big deal.

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.520
Robert Downey Jr.'s return to the screen.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.720
Like, I don't think so.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.920
Now, what about Grey's Anatomy and then the spin-off Private Practice?

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.320
Here's what's, I'm looking through this, and I think my problem isn't,

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.800
my problem is what didn't make the cut.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:01.640
Yeah, so like, oh, Dan Brown made it, but not Hurricane Katrina.

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:07.240
Like, so Sarah Palin is up in the mix.

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.320
Not 9-11, though, so.

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:13.960
No, well, she said Twin Towers in that sort of shorthand for 9-11.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.040
Never forget Twin Towers.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.880
It could be, see, it could be referring to the second Lord of the Rings movie.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:21.320
It could not.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.520
No, it could not.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.000
Grey's Anatomy is made for you, Kung Fu Panda 1 and 2.

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:35.800
There, I think that's better because it gets some like super important cultural stuff.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.560
I think that it would be better if it was all just not like what happened in the world,

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.960
but like a personal recount of your 1990 to 2009.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:48.120
So it's like, met a guy, we broke up, went to dinner, met some people,

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.760
then I went to college, and it was pretty cool.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:53.800
And it was just like a personal telling of stuff that happened in your life.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.480
Can you explain to me the sort of sliding scale that puts going to dinner with some people

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.560
and graduating college on the same import?

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:00.680
Like, it was a good dinner.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.440
It wasn't, it wasn't a very good college.

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.760
It wasn't a very good verse.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.440
It was mostly a party school.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:13.000
I graduate and still a fool, and I went and got on Yahoo Answers with this song.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Rebecca Rose, who asks,

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.360
what would you consider to be personality traits of an ideal stallion?

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.800
Uh-huh.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:30.680
Uh-huh, go on.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.560
No, I won't go on because that's all that this question is.

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.760
Like, literal stallion.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.480
Yeah, like a, like a, like a horse, like a proud.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.640
Well, I think we can all agree, unbroken spirit.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.320
Unbroken spirit.

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.320
Unbroken legs also is important.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.640
Less of a personality.

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:48.680
I think discreet.

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.680
Able to keep a secret.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.040
What is the application of that?

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:55.880
Why do we need a discreet?

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:59.240
Well, Griffin, if I knew the application, I wouldn't, I wouldn't tell you.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:01.240
I mean, I'm trying to be like a stallion here.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:05.000
It defeats the point of discretion if you just go and your wiener pics everywhere.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.400
Hey, hey horse, why did you tweet this picture of my wiener?

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.400
Hey horse, I didn't give you my phone.

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.400
That was between us.

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.400
That was between us, horse.

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.600
What if I came to you in confidence?

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.120
What kind of smartphone could a horse possibly operate?

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.200
This question is ridiculous.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.880
So there's another good personality trait.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.680
Dexterity.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.160
Dexterity, like, yeah, manual dexterity.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.960
Um, tail, a smooth tail, a proud tail.

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:38.440
That's important in races.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.880
And also not a racist.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:42.840
I don't like a horse.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:46.840
I want them to love all horses and humans equally.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:47.640
Open-minded.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:48.520
Yeah.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:51.880
It's okay if they're biasing against fat people because that's like a health issue.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.800
Yeah, they'll snap right in half.

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:59.080
Um, I think, I think you gotta, it's gotta have some wisdom in its eyes.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.280
Mmm, that's good.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:04.520
I think when you look deep in that horse's eyes, you've gotta know that there's, there's,

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.320
there's feelings stirring around in there, you know?

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.000
And no bugs.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:09.480
No bugs.

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.800
I hate it when a horse has bugs in there and it won't even use its comically long tongue

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.840
to lick them off.

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:19.400
Or sweep the way with its mane with a flourish of its proud long head.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.240
Um, have you mentioned-

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:22.920
I just love horses so much.

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:24.680
I love horses too.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:28.920
I love their thick trunks and I think that I need a proud horse.

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.600
I think I need a proud, um, gelding.

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:36.280
I want a, I want a horse that's gonna be more like a best friend.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:37.720
Right, right.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.360
And maybe we go on adventures together and like, my cowboy hat falls off and he picks

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.000
it up for me and nudges me forward and drives me on.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:45.880
That's so great.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:51.080
I just, I want a horse I can hang out with in every possible definition of the term.

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.920
Yeah, just a horse who's fucking cool.

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:55.400
You know, not uppity like some of those other horses.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:57.080
I just want to hang out.

01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:03.160
I want a horse that if I joke like, maybe today you can ride me, he'll laugh, but he

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.000
won't take the joke too far.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.520
Yeah, very painful.

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:07.400
They're very heavy.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:12.360
I've, I've ridden a lot of pintos that will just like take the goof and run with it.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.640
And it's like, now it's weird pinto and I have to put you down.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.080
Now I have to destroy you.

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.440
Because I know you're not discreet.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.640
I was trying to forgive that.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:25.080
But now I want a horse that knows that when I have to destroy him, I have to do it.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:25.400
Sure.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:30.520
Like he's, he's, he feels bad for you because of the position that he is putting you in

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.040
with his broke ass legs.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:35.160
He knows it's going to hurt me more than it's going to hurt him.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:35.400
Yeah.

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.360
I want, yeah.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:42.120
And I want him to make it easier on me by hurling some really hateful shit.

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.440
Like hateful shit about my parents and loved ones.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.040
Oh, like I bet you won't do it.

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:46.840
You coward.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:47.480
You coward.

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:51.320
Well, that's it, we are, we're putting the horse before the cart.

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:55.880
You've got to, you've got to, you're supposed to put the horse before the cart.

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.320
Shut your fucking mouth.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:01.400
You've got to have, see that's the kind of talk that'll get a horse shot.

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.960
He has got to be able to talk.

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:04.840
He has to possess.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:07.320
Yeah.

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.800
Which is, what's the point?

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.600
Which is rare.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:12.360
I think.

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:12.920
Mare.

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:15.000
But worth, worth a couple extra bucks.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:15.880
Yeah.

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:16.200
Yeah.

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:16.440
Yeah.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.720
I'll drop an extra.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.120
Oh, that's a big, he has to be cheap.

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.800
He has to not cost a lot of money.

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:26.600
So we need a cheap talking horse that's able to use a smartphone and will pick up my cowboy

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.560
hat with tenderness.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.920
Just discretion for miles.

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:30.520
That should be his name.

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.640
Discretion for miles.

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:32.680
Discretion for miles.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:37.720
I want one that doesn't make you kill it to get the glue out of him.

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:37.960
Yeah.

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.240
Just show me where your glue is.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.320
Give him your glue, you stingy bastard.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.520
He's got some glue.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.520
You want to be able to lactate his glue gland.

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:45.960
Mm hmm.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.680
Exactly.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.040
For a quick patch job.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:50.440
I think that.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:52.680
Your horse feet.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.000
Is it too much to ask for a winning smile?

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.600
No.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:57.640
A winning smile?

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.480
I couldn't, I couldn't understand you.

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:03.960
I would like my horse to enjoy eating apples.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.240
Can we make that happen?

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:06.520
And oats.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:06.840
Yes.

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.360
Don't mistake my fingers for carrots.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.720
I'm just giving you this carrot.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.440
Silly doof.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:17.160
Can we give an apologetic horse for when he does nibble your fingers?

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.080
Rainbows behind him leaves rainbows.

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.760
Can we get a rainbow horse?

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.200
I want a horse with a horn.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.240
Okay.

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:23.480
Okay.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.000
That is a unicorn, but.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.680
No, because it doesn't have to be on his head.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.000
It could also be a deer.

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.000
Like a buck.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.080
A buck is basically a horse with a horn.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:40.360
What about a horse with like mini horns that makes it like a spiny exoskeleton?

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.920
Ah, and maybe fire shoots out of his nose.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.160
Yeah.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:43.560
Okay.

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.800
Can I, and he can fly.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:46.840
Yeah.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:50.600
And also he's got a big saddle on it and you can ride on him.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:52.280
And he's got like a tank gun.

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:54.360
Yeah, he's got a tank gun for a mouth.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.080
He's got like howitzer treads on his legs.

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:57.800
Fuck yeah.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.040
And he can fucking like fly through space and shit.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.160
Yeah.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.560
And he's, he can shoot, he can shoot blood out of him.

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.000
So fucking discreet.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.280
Just discreet as shit.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.360
He will never tell anyone about any of this.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.680
I want to ride.

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:16.600
Oh, maybe he looks like a regular horse by day and then an awesome space tank spiny horse.

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:17.400
Holy fuck.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:17.640
Like a he-man.

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.760
Transformer horse.

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:19.560
Yes.

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:19.880
Yes.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:22.040
I'm a tank.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:25.400
I'm a horse.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.360
Come here Shia.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.200
Shia, come here.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.080
Grab my mane.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.040
Feed me oats.

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:32.840
I'm gonna shoot blood out of my face.

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.360
I'm eight feet tall.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.640
I'm a big robot horse.

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:38.040
Does it look like a robot horse?

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:42.840
Or does it look like a regular horse that transforms flawlessly into sort of a fleshy,

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.520
mane-y.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.600
And sprays blood everywhere in the process.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:48.440
And it's killed.

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.480
That's so important.

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:52.840
Shia, you're probably gonna want to step back a little bit further.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:55.320
Here's your Gallagher, your Gallagher poncho.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.200
Just tuck into that real quick.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.680
Transform from a horse into a horse tank.

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:02.520
You may get soaked, you will get wet.

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:04.600
With horse blood.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.120
With horse blood.

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:09.080
That horse is not going to survive the transformation process.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.120
I'm sorry.

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.480
I'll never tell anyone.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.800
You are rending parts of that horse that you will not be able to reattach.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.160
No, no.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:22.920
How come every time we talk about fucking horses on this show, we always talk about just mutilating?

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:23.400
How does that keep happening?

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:26.600
Because there's something about destroying one of God's most beautiful creatures.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:29.400
We basically-

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.920
So powerful and majestic.

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:31.800
I just want to kill it.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:35.720
We've been going on this show for about 15 minutes now, designing the perfect horse,

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:42.040
and we reached a point where we reached perfect horse that like nobody's ever been able to

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:44.040
conceive of before, and then we ruined it.

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:46.680
Well, yes.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:53.160
We as human beings often are jealous of the power and majesty of a horse,

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.520
and then it's time to destroy it.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:59.480
We reached the index of horse possibilities.

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:02.120
I think that the most important thing about a horse,

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:03.800
the most important personality-

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.720
Let's get back to personality for a second.

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:06.360
Okay.

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.360
I think the most important personality of a horse is that it not be too beautiful,

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:11.640
because then you want to destroy it.

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:15.480
Like if you got like some Jared Leto looking motherfucking horse,

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:18.600
you're going to want to take a ball-peen hammer to its temple instantly.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.560
It's too beautiful.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.560
It's just like Fight Club.

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.960
You just want to destroy something beautiful, you know?

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:24.200
Yeah.

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:27.080
Just smash its face in with another horse.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:32.040
Slash, glass menagerie, glass horse with a horn on it somewhere,

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.800
and you just want to destroy it.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.720
I just want to slam two horses together.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.960
Find the god particle.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:41.960
Oh, shit.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.720
Live from the spot, rough and raw, at our daddy's house.

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.080
We're at our daddy's house.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:51.960
Let me check the date.

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.400
I just opened up the calendar.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.640
It's pasta party 2011.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:56.280
Good.

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.960
Welcome to our daddy's house.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.640
We're live from our daddy's couch.

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:00.360
Let me check this.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:04.520
Let me check the spaghettometer, because it looks like we're going full-blown pasta.

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.480
Spaghett-it on.

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:09.240
Let's spaghett-a-ghett-in 2011.

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:12.600
As you well know, as you've probably guessed, we had a-

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:16.200
We carbo-loaded pre-show here in Ironton.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.280
Our stepmom Carol fed us a bunch of spaghetti.

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.120
We're fucking primed for carbo-

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.400
Who fed us spaghetti?

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.520
Who fed us spaghetti?

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.560
Yes, I will.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.760
She's looked down at us and said,

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.960
you're not fucking funny enough.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.000
Eat some more spaghetti.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:33.960
She shoved spaghett-fistful after fistful of sweet spaghett into my mouth.

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.200
I am ready to blow.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.720
Noodle up, you unfunny fucks.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.200
It's time to get spaghett.

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.480
You got spaghett.

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:44.520
Okay.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:50.120
I'm a lesbian, and I, uh, okay.

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.160
That was British, okay.

01:20:51.160 --> 01:21:00.120
I'm a lesbian, and I recently cut my hair, but now I'm having second thoughts.

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:03.960
Before, it was all the way down to my waist, and now it's more a men's style cut,

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:07.400
although still long enough to show my loverly curls.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.000
I think it looks cute.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.760
It's very low maintenance, and it seems to be net positive with the ladies.

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.720
But I've noticed that strangers are ruder to me.

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:18.440
Should I stick it out and get used to being perceived differently by people,

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.960
or grow my hair long and lovely?

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:23.320
Or grow my hair long and lovely again, so as to fly to the gay-dar,

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.760
and avoid the occasional embarrassing mistake about my gender?

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:29.320
Fan from the post-lesbian apocalypse.

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:33.000
Is she asking us if she should be proud of her lesbianity?

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:33.960
Her lesbianics?

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:36.520
She wants to be a lesbian.

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.040
She doesn't want to be mistaken for a dude.

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.040
But I do have to tell you though,

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:47.800
this decision is largely out of your hands for the next month or so.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:52.520
So here's my advice, try it for a month and see what you think.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:55.320
If you still don't like it, grow it long then.

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:59.080
There are worse things that you could be mistaken for than a dude.

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:00.440
Do you know what I'm saying?

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:01.320
Liam Gallagher.

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:01.880
Liam Gallagher.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.720
No, fucking Bieber.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:04.520
Bieber.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.560
You can look, you can get a Bieber, a sweet Bieber bowl,

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.320
and then you are in a lot of trouble.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:12.120
Unless your name is Justin, and your last name is Bieber.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.840
And your middle name is whatever Justin Bieber's name is.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:15.640
Saul.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:16.440
Saul.

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:16.940
Justin.

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:19.100
Justin Saul Bieber.

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:22.060
Justin Shmuel Bieber.

01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:23.260
No, here's all that coming.

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:28.300
You know what, it actually is Justin Osama Bieber.

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.420
A lot of people don't know that.

01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.140
Usain Bieber.

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:36.060
Justin Hannah Montana Bieber.

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:41.740
You know what, if you like it, if you like your haircut, it's yours.

01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:43.420
It's your haircut, own it.

01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:44.300
Yeah, fuck people.

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:46.540
Listen, if they're gonna think you're a dude,

01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.220
they're obviously somebody you don't know very well.

01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:52.140
That's a pretty good litmus test as to whether or not they're useless.

01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:52.940
Hey, are you a dude?

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:54.220
No, like fuck you.

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:54.860
Get out of here.

01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:56.700
I don't, like I obviously don't want to chill with you.

01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:57.740
Look at my shapeliness.

01:22:57.740 --> 01:22:59.980
Look at my shapely curvaceousness.

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:01.660
Look at this womb-basting body.

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:05.020
Excuse me?

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:08.460
Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot and slightly androgynous like me?

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.340
Is my favorite pussycat doll song.

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:13.820
There are so many though, it's hard to choose.

01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:14.620
Yeah, there are so many.

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:15.580
Buttons is good too.

01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:16.140
Buttons is good.

01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:17.500
Pushing up my buttons, I like that.

01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:19.500
Mr. Boombastic.

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:20.620
Mr. Boombastic.

01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:20.940
Mr. Boombastic.

01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:21.980
Oh holy night.

01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:22.940
Don't make me sweat.

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:25.420
That's another one.

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:27.100
Duel of the fates.

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:34.300
Pussycat dolls are the most flexible artists of our times.

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:36.700
Femme from my closet.

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:42.140
They are unstoppable.

01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:43.820
The Declaration of Independence.

01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:45.740
Yeah, that hit song.

01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:47.980
Declaration of Independence.

01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:48.380
What?

01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:50.060
Now you're just giving me documents.

01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:51.100
The Rosetta Stone.

01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:53.740
The Sphinx.

01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:55.900
The Empire State Building.

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:56.860
What are we doing?

01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:01.180
We are fucked up our pasta.

01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:03.900
Oh shit.

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:04.540
Oh my god.

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:05.660
Holy shit.

01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:06.140
Jesus.

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:09.340
Oh my god.

01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:13.500
Oh god.

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.420
You can just call me a self spaghetti.

01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:18.060
I'm feeling this pasta vibe.

01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:22.220
How about one final Yali?

01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:23.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:24.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:26.460
This one was sent in by Galiayali.

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:27.820
Thank you, Galiayali.

01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:29.820
It's by Yali Lancer's user.

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.020
Oh no.

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:33.020
The picture itself is pretty wonderful.

01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:35.020
The real Marty Janetti.

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:38.380
Except no substitutes.

01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:39.580
Are you guys soaking in that image?

01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:41.340
That tiny thumbnail?

01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:43.420
Yeah, it's a wrestler and he's holding a belt.

01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:46.620
Usually if I don't know a celebrity, they're a wrestler.

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:50.140
TheRealSomethingSomething asks,

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:55.660
how can I convince my girlfriend to dress up like Violet Beauregard from Willy Wonka?

01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:58.620
I am in love with two ladies.

01:24:58.620 --> 01:24:59.180
Okay.

01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:04.460
My sweet little blueberry, aka my G friend, and Violet Beauregard from Willy Wonka.

01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:09.820
I think it's so sexy the when Violet inflates into a sphere

01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:12.300
and would love to see my lady do the same.

01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:17.180
How can I convince her that this would be both fun and sexy?

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:19.820
She doesn't realize it yet,

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:22.700
but her nickname comes from my number one screen crush.

01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:28.780
I bought the costume last week and I'm fighting up the courage to ask her.

01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:30.220
Please, any suggestions?

01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:34.780
P.S. Not like in the new crappy Johnny Depp Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:36.860
That CGI looked horrible.

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:38.220
Only Mel Stuart's version.

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:43.340
I can't, I can't finish unless it's the Mel Stuart's version.

01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:46.780
You look, right now, Rashonda, you look beautiful,

01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:52.460
but you look like that shitty Johnny Depp version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:55.020
Honey, I got you this outfit and this bicycle pump.

01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:56.140
Let's go to town.

01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:59.820
Yeah, we are going to give you some artificial juice filled dumps.

01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:03.100
You ever hear that thing where it's like,

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:05.580
if you press this button, you'll get a million dollars,

01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:07.340
but someone in the world will die.

01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:07.660
Yeah.

01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:08.620
Do you press the button?

01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:10.540
If I can guarantee it's this guy,

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:12.060
I'm just going to start hammering on it.

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:18.220
Oh man, how stealth do you have to be about your number one screen crush

01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:21.100
that you have given this girl a nickname,

01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:24.780
which is my little blueberry and she doesn't know what it's referring to.

01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:27.660
You have to watch this movie like on the reg, right?

01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:30.460
Like, and you could tell he's got like a half motor,

01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:31.820
like when she walks in the room.

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:33.500
She swells, he swells, baby.

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:34.780
That's how I do.

01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:35.820
That's gross.

01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:38.860
That is so unpleasant that you would like that so much.

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:43.580
If you're going to get, if you're going to jerk it to anything in that movie,

01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:47.340
why not a Goose's Gloop getting sucked up in that chocolate pond,

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:48.620
that chocolate tube?

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:52.540
I feel like, I feel like we've just found a really great psychological test.

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:55.740
There's like, if you had to jerk it to one scene in Willy Wonka

01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:58.700
and your answer means something.

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:00.860
How about if you jerk to any second about that movie,

01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:06.060
which is primarily about, primarily about murdering kids.

01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:07.180
Boy, there is, you know what?

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:08.620
As angry as I was about this guy,

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.780
there is a much more unpleasant gentleman

01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:13.660
whose fetish is a little boy stuck in a chocolate tube.

01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:15.900
Yeah, there's that.

01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:17.900
You don't have to lay it.

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:21.420
The parts of your brain of fear and arousal are right next to each other

01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:23.180
is anything scarier than that,

01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:26.380
the look on that fucking kid's face when he's surrounded

01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:29.820
by plastic and tiny orange men and sweet chocolate.

01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:31.500
It's like, it's heaven and hell, baby.

01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:33.980
He knows death is around the corner.

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:36.220
What about the girl that gets thrown in the incinerator?

01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:36.780
Yeah.

01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:38.380
That movie is terrifying.

01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:40.700
Why, why am I so erect then?

01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:42.940
Oh, that was a bad-

01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:46.300
There is no earthly way of knowing why I have this huge boner.

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:47.100
That was a bad anarchy.

01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:48.060
Well, no, no, no.

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:51.100
There is no earthly way of knowing why my boner is still growing.

01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:56.700
But the bulge is surely showing.

01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:57.500
Is it shrinking?

01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:58.300
Is it blowing?

01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:01.100
And the semen now is flowing.

01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:18.220
I had a lot of fun here today, Trev.

01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:19.580
Goose and goose and goose.

01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:20.700
Goose and goose.

01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:22.540
But I think we also learned something.

01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:23.340
I know I did.

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:27.980
I did, I learned that I miss Griffin and I hope he's back from Japan soon.

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:29.500
I miss Griffin too.

01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:34.620
Got some reminder here for you.

01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:42.140
MBMBAMCandleNights.BrownPaperTickets.com is where you can go to go buy your tickets for

01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:45.340
My Brother, My Brother, Me, Home for the Candle Nights, Holiday Spectacular,

01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:49.500
featuring Sawbones, 7 PM, December 21st at Huntington City Hall.

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:52.620
Huntington City Hall has a beautiful theater in it.

01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:54.620
It's replete with history.

01:28:56.300 --> 01:29:00.860
We are going to be able to hang out all weekend and chill with you and have fun.

01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:02.780
And it's going to be great.

01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:06.940
It also is really going to be like a homecoming for us because we all three grew up doing

01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:10.300
theater in that auditorium in that theater.

01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.540
So it's going to be literally like our home turf.

01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:14.780
We have the most experience being on that stage.

01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:18.060
It's going to be a really great show and you will not want to miss it.

01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:19.420
I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:20.460
So make sure you get tickets.

01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:21.660
They're 15 bucks.

01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:24.620
You know, buy them for an early Christmas gift.

01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:25.740
What a surprise.

01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:27.180
Thank you so much for this.

01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:28.700
Speaking of Christmas gifts.

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:29.260
Yep.

01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:32.460
We also launched all that new merch we've been talking about.

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:33.500
Finally.

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:39.020
It's up on MaxFunStore.com and we have so we've had a poster that's only been available

01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:40.060
at live shows.

01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:44.140
That poster is still only available at live shows, but you can get the red version on

01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:44.780
the store.

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:49.900
We have our sticker packages, our button packets, the coolest patch you'll ever see in your

01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:50.940
entire life.

01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:51.900
Guaranteed.

01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:53.820
Our pack your bags and move away tote bag.

01:29:54.620 --> 01:30:03.020
We've got two prints up that are the NBNBAM 2013 and the NBNBAM 2012 year in review.

01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:05.740
And of course, our T-shirts are up there.

01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:08.620
The P1's nasty gum and our question mark T-shirt.

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:13.500
And the quicker this stuff sells out, the faster it moves, the more likely it is that

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.820
we'll keep putting more and more new stuff up there.

01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:17.180
So get it for yourself.

01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:18.620
Get it for a loved one.

01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:21.580
Buy it now before it sells out because it's been going fast.

01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:26.140
Everyone's been talking about it on Twitter and I guarantee we're going to sell out of

01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:26.460
this stuff.

01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:28.060
It's all at MaxFunStore.com.

01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:28.780
Go get it.

01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:31.980
While you're on the internet, go to YouTube.

01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:39.820
Go to YouTube.com slash NBNBAM and you are going to find a bevy of hit clips to enjoy.

01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:43.580
We broke 4,000 subscribers, which is great and we really appreciate it.

01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:46.620
And the more subscribers we get, the more stuff we'll do.

01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:51.420
If we hit 10,000 subscribers, I get to use the YouTube studios to do whatever I want

01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:53.740
and probably just film myself eating sandwiches.

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:55.500
And who doesn't want to see that?

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:56.380
It's a sight to see.

01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:57.260
It's like a freak show.

01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:00.220
And I'm going to-

01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:04.060
You won't believe how many toppings the geek puts on his sandwich.

01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:05.660
He eats it all in one bite.

01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:08.460
And I'm going to keep putting up new videos.

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.060
I'm going to try to do like two or three a week.

01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:14.940
If you haven't gone, go check out the amazing animated videos that Tyler Crowley did for us.

01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:18.940
There's a new one of Pizza Clone that is just incredible.

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:20.940
It's like NBNBAM 2.0.

01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:22.380
You're going to absolutely dig it.

01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:24.140
So go check those out.

01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:24.940
Tell your friends.

01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:26.860
Share those videos all over the place.

01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:30.060
It's why we're making them so people will listen to them who don't normally listen to

01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:30.460
the show.

01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:32.540
So make sure you share that.

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:34.540
And while you're at it, just share the show.

01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:35.260
Tell a friend.

01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:40.860
We haven't brought that up in a while, but the best advertisement we have is you.

01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:45.020
So if you're in a car with someone who's never listened to the show before, maybe pop it

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:45.520
on.

01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:47.420
Maybe send someone a link.

01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:49.900
Maybe make them watch a clip of the show.

01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:50.400
Something.

01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:52.060
And let's get the word out there.

01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:54.540
We're on Twitter at NBNBAM.

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:56.380
We're on the Maximum Fund Network.

01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:58.940
There are a ton of other shows there.

01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:02.940
Throwing Shade, Stop Podcasting Yourself, Judge John Hodgman, Jordan Jessico, Bullseye,

01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:10.140
The Goose Down, Lady the Lady, One Bad Mother, Destination DIY, Baby Geniuses, The Fop House.

01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:11.100
I could go on forever.

01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:14.940
I would like to spotlight Baby Geniuses because I am now their producer and I am working on

01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:18.940
putting up their episode, which should be up a couple hours after this one.

01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:20.060
And you should go check it out.

01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:22.860
It is a really good episode, you guys.

01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:25.900
And then go listen back to all their other episodes if you haven't already.

01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:26.780
Who's the guest?

01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:27.340
Who's the guest?

01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:28.460
Let's see.

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.420
Emily Gordon is one of them from the Inside Kids.

01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:32.140
Is that right?

01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:32.860
Indoor Kids.

01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:33.900
From the Indoor Kids.

01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:35.500
From the Inside Kids.

01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:38.140
No, that's a joke from Kurt Braunholt.

01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:39.980
What is this globe in the sky?

01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:44.060
Kurt Braunholt called them the Inside Children and now I can't get that out of my head.

01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:45.820
But go check out the show.

01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:47.500
You're going to love it.

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:50.460
Just go ahead and subscribe and download all the episodes when they come out.

01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:56.460
They're one of the new shows we added to our lineup for Max Fun Week along with

01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:58.700
Fop House and Destination DIY.

01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:01.020
And trust me, all three are incredible.

01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:04.060
Do not miss out.

01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:05.500
So that's going to do it for-

01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:10.940
Oh, we also want to say thanks to John Roderick of The Long Winters for allowing us to use

01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:14.140
the theme song It's a Departure off of the album Putting the Days to Bed.

01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:15.500
Go buy it if you haven't already.

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:19.260
I assume everyone's listened to it and everyone's bought it eight times already.

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:21.100
But if you haven't, go buy it.

01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:25.900
Maybe buy it on vinyl if it's available and give it to someone for Christmas, for Candle

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:26.540
Night.

01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:28.700
It makes a beautiful, beautiful-

01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:29.340
What's the other one?

01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:32.220
What's the one that he and Jonathan Colton did for Christmas?

01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:34.780
Oh, crap.

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:35.740
The title escapes me.

01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:36.780
Okay.

01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:37.500
Well, go check out-

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:38.540
One Christmas at a time?

01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:39.500
Yes.

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:39.980
I think.

01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:40.220
Yes.

01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:43.660
Go check out John Roderick and Jonathan Colton's Christmas album.

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:46.220
It's going to make your Candle Nights.

01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:50.220
Maybe you haven't had any friends or family ever, or maybe your friends and family don't

01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:50.780
love each other.

01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:51.660
Well, here's the thing.

01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:54.700
You put on this Candle Nights album, it's going to fix all that.

01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:57.020
Okay.

01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:58.860
Now, that is actually going to do it for us.

01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:00.060
Remember to go get your tickets.

01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:03.900
We have sold out every show we've ever done, usually in less than an hour.

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:10.540
We have a lot more tickets than that for this show, and it is not in a large city, so we

01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:12.540
think that you will have a better shot, but-

01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:13.660
But don't wait.

01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:14.220
Don't wait.

01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:15.020
Don't sleep on it.

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:24.140
15 bucks gets you in, and the web address, again, is nbnbamcandlenights at brownpapertickets.com.

01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:25.740
If you got questions, just ask us.

01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:28.140
And that's going to do it for us.

01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:30.060
Thank you so much for joining us.

01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:32.460
We don't have a last Yahoo this week.

01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:35.260
So, Travis, what should, like, how do we end?

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:37.340
I'll make a big fart sound.

01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:37.900
Okay, cool.

01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:42.140
You got to say, oh, yeah, I go and do that now.

01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:45.820
Pretty funny.

01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:47.180
That's solid.

01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:48.220
Huh?

01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:50.380
You're not going to get goofed like that on any other network.

01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:51.100
You're still talking.

01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:51.980
That was supposed to be the end.

01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:52.540
I'm sorry.

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:53.100
Try to go.

01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:55.900
You got to say your name.

01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:57.020
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:58.140
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:34:58.140 --> 01:34:59.900
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:01.260
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:03.260
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.
