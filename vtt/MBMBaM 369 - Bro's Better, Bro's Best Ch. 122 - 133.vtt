00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:50.320
My boss at work has an odd way to say a passing hello, and it's confusing me.

00:51.440 --> 00:56.240
Walk by me and say, what do you think? But not asking about anything in particular.

00:56.240 --> 01:03.840
This happens a few times a day, and I don't know how to respond. What kind of things should I say?

01:03.840 --> 01:07.840
Should I come up with a standard response, or should I mix it up a little bit?

01:07.840 --> 01:08.640
Help me, brothers.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.920
There's literally so many ways to respond to this.

01:14.800 --> 01:15.680
What do you think?

01:15.680 --> 01:17.520
My favorite being, what do you think?

01:18.320 --> 01:23.360
Just turn the mirror up to nature and make him go, that doesn't make any sense.

01:23.920 --> 01:24.480
Exactly.

01:25.120 --> 01:25.760
What can you do?

01:25.760 --> 01:30.640
No, I think you've got to randomly pick an adjective that you can give to him as a response,

01:30.640 --> 01:32.880
like, oh, pretty wet, or something like that.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.600
I was going to say a noun, and you could just be like, potatoes.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.840
Well, that doesn't make sense, because when-

01:37.840 --> 01:39.680
Exactly, what do you think we're going to have for lunch?

01:40.240 --> 01:42.640
Okay, but he would say that, I think.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.920
No, like, what do you think? Like, someone had just, like,

01:45.920 --> 01:49.680
maybe there's someone that always sees your boss before you that says, like,

01:49.680 --> 01:54.480
do you guys want to go out after work? And then the boss is saying what you think about it,

01:54.480 --> 01:56.800
but you were not part of the A part of the conversation.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.840
Okay, and so he dips your head, and then your response to

01:59.840 --> 02:02.480
what should we eat for lunch is potatoes.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.120
Potatoes.

02:03.120 --> 02:07.680
Just mash them, boil them, stick them in a stew.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.240
You don't know.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.400
Travis is a bore, so it's good.

02:12.400 --> 02:12.720
Grubs?

02:12.720 --> 02:14.160
That works, huh? Grubs?

02:16.320 --> 02:19.520
Travis is Timon, and I'm Pumbaa, and we have a comedy podcast.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.360
It's called Timon and Pumbaa.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.520
And not Griffin.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.320
And not Griffin, because he's not down with bugs.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.680
Hey, maybe that's a good response.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.120
What do you think?

02:31.120 --> 02:32.080
Hakuna matata.

02:34.800 --> 02:35.360
I love it.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.960
You guys ever watch Slim Goodbody?

02:44.080 --> 02:48.880
Wouldn't it be awesome just once you could see, like, an awesome dookie?

02:50.880 --> 02:52.000
Slim Goodbody?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.840
Yeah, like one ribald-

02:55.360 --> 02:57.760
You're saying, like, if you could look through Slim Goodbody

02:57.760 --> 02:58.960
and see a pit performing-

02:58.960 --> 02:59.840
Just one episode.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.080
Like a deleted scene somewhere where he's like,

03:02.080 --> 03:04.000
eyes aren't a bunch of corned beef.

03:05.520 --> 03:08.320
I got a kid fit, and then go shit.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.920
I'm packing a solid bolus in here.

03:11.920 --> 03:15.040
This is going to turn into a joke.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.080
Read both at the same time.

03:16.080 --> 03:16.880
Here we go.

03:16.880 --> 03:17.840
This Yahoo answer was sent in-

03:17.840 --> 03:19.120
I recently found out what-

03:19.120 --> 03:20.080
We're not really doing this.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.920
It was sent in by Crystal Whalen.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.360
Thanks, Krista.

03:23.360 --> 03:24.160
You know it's good.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.000
That's like the Nintendo seal of quality.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.680
It's by Yahoo answer's user, Chris, who asks,

03:30.240 --> 03:31.760
what is the hole on the penis called?

03:31.760 --> 03:32.400
Travis, do you-

03:34.400 --> 03:35.360
I do know.

03:35.360 --> 03:35.920
Do you really?

03:36.960 --> 03:38.080
I mean, it's the urethra.

03:38.080 --> 03:38.400
Nope.

03:39.280 --> 03:39.600
Yeah.

03:39.600 --> 03:40.960
Nope, nope.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.120
Their urethra is the tube that connects the penis hole to the piss bag.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.920
The hole in the tip of the penis-

03:49.920 --> 03:50.880
Is the tip hole.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.520
Is called the debt ceiling.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.880
Is your penis not?

03:55.920 --> 03:58.000
No, it's technically called the debt ceiling.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.720
That's why they're always talking about raising the debt ceiling.

04:00.720 --> 04:01.120
Right.

04:01.120 --> 04:04.560
That's why it was such a kerfuffle and a little racy.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.320
That's why it was such a hot button issue.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.240
I have had control of my dreams for so long

04:10.240 --> 04:12.800
that I'm worried if I go in willy-nilly,

04:12.800 --> 04:14.960
the dreams are just going to run roughshod over my emotions.

04:14.960 --> 04:18.000
Yeah, the dream lord will be like, finally, a weak point.

04:18.000 --> 04:18.880
Finally.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.760
Now experience all the emojis you've been holding back.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.440
You've been holding onto these emojis in this bottle.

04:25.440 --> 04:26.400
I've been saving them.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.680
Experience them all.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.880
Have sex with the teeth that fell out of your head

04:30.880 --> 04:34.160
because you're naked at school and you forgot your lines at the play.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.840
And you're forgotten how to run quickly

04:35.840 --> 04:37.840
and you feel like you're moving through molasses.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.280
And also you're flying off a cliff and you're on fire

04:41.280 --> 04:43.760
and your parents are there and there's your grandma.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.040
And you're trying to punch the dude,

04:45.040 --> 04:46.800
but you can't remember how to make a fist.

04:46.800 --> 04:50.240
You can't remember how to make a fist and your hands are bones and teeth.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.920
And all your stuff will come in a very discreet box.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.600
None of those big like bright red,

04:55.600 --> 04:58.480
this box full of dildos boxes you normally get.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.400
You'll be lucky if you can find it.

05:01.200 --> 05:04.560
They will make it look like the rock you hide your key under.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.320
I could have sworn I ordered something from them.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.760
They actually, have you guys seen Looper?

05:09.760 --> 05:11.440
What they do is they travel back in time

05:11.440 --> 05:14.640
and they give you that dildo 20 minutes before you ordered it.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.800
So you've all actually always had that dildo.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.040
Only you go, what?

05:19.040 --> 05:19.920
Wait a second.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.480
But then you go 30 years and it's your dildo.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.360
It was your dildo.

05:26.800 --> 05:27.760
They closed the loop.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.200
I closed my dildo loop.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.160
Now close your loop.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.680
And by loop, I mean butthole.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.880
Close it up with this thing.

05:34.880 --> 05:34.960
Get it in there.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.400
At extremistrains.com.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.600
Keep on going, Middle East.

05:37.600 --> 05:38.640
Close your loop.

05:38.640 --> 05:39.920
You're orgasming wrong.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.680
I'm Dan Ackroyd, the brother of old Joseph Lloyd Leavitt.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.440
And I'm going to close your dildo loop.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.640
He grew up into me.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.280
He grew up into me in an alternate future

05:49.280 --> 05:50.320
where someone gave him a dildo.

05:50.320 --> 05:50.960
Can you believe it?

05:50.960 --> 05:52.000
No, neither can I.

05:53.200 --> 05:53.760
Me neither.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.520
I really hope people come in the future.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.520
In the future, dildos are illegal.

05:57.520 --> 06:00.800
So we have to put them in this machine and send them back to you.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.480
And you can save money on them.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.600
And you got to get rid of them.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.280
By which I mean put them all the way up your butt

06:05.280 --> 06:06.640
until you can't see it anymore.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.480
That way future cops can't find it.

06:08.480 --> 06:14.000
Griffin, are you suggesting that the reason Dan Ackroyd's head is increasing in size

06:14.000 --> 06:18.720
is because people are using his head to store contraband future dildos?

06:18.720 --> 06:20.880
Is that what you're saying to me right now?

06:20.880 --> 06:25.120
And as I assume all of you want a my brother, my brother and me shout out,

06:25.120 --> 06:30.240
just go to maximumfun.org forward slash Dumbotron.

06:30.240 --> 06:34.400
That dude, you could join the podcast.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.040
I can't believe that I used that word.

06:37.040 --> 06:41.680
I can't believe that I used the same air in this room to wish those people

06:41.680 --> 06:45.680
that said that the stars were each other's love or something

06:45.680 --> 06:49.440
to also say that Dan Ackroyd's head is full of illegal future dildos.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.600
Maybe smoke a little doja and then go in.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.640
Oh, maybe get a little drunk.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.600
Maybe you can smoke a little peaches and herb and then go in.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.280
Yeah, I like that.

07:03.280 --> 07:10.080
It's like office space, but instead of getting hip motized, you get a little dip.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.200
You get ganja-tized.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.080
I'll work on it.

07:14.080 --> 07:14.720
I'll workshop it.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.680
I'll come back.

07:15.680 --> 07:16.880
Hip pot-tized?

07:16.880 --> 07:17.680
Is that any good?

07:18.480 --> 07:22.480
Maybe spend an hour with Man for Man's Earth band and then you roll in.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.600
Say, hey, what's up with the word?

07:26.960 --> 07:28.000
Where's the paper at?

07:28.000 --> 07:28.960
Let me sign it.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.080
We file those reports for you.

07:32.080 --> 07:35.520
Hey, these keys are crazy, man.

07:37.360 --> 07:40.000
We've never smoked marijuana before, so we're just guessing what it is.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.760
Mason, that's what it's like.

07:42.400 --> 07:43.840
You're trapped in a glass box.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.480
It makes you talk like a very meek jazz musician.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.200
And he's afraid of waking the baby.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.560
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

07:50.560 --> 07:55.200
Hey, no, no, no, no, no, shh, shh, shh.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.560
Look at that computer screen.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.000
Ooh, I'm gonna type in an email.

08:03.120 --> 08:07.120
I think that'd be such a power play to just start being the guy in your office who always

08:07.120 --> 08:08.160
talk like that.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.640
Just low talk Greg and everyone's like, what?

08:10.640 --> 08:11.520
Excuse me?

08:11.520 --> 08:12.000
What did you say?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.600
They would eventually, even if you had put in your two weeks notice, they would ask you

08:15.600 --> 08:16.320
to stop coming.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.720
I can't hear you over the laser printer.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.080
What the fuck did you say?

08:20.080 --> 08:23.280
I can't believe I just sent that email without a subject.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.640
Can you believe that?

08:24.640 --> 08:27.520
I wish they put a little, I wish they had a little guy in there.

08:27.520 --> 08:28.480
You could just call it back.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.440
Come on back, email.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.040
I don't like this guy.

08:35.040 --> 08:35.840
I don't like this guy.

08:35.840 --> 08:36.800
I like this guy too.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.560
Can I talk like this for the rest of my life?

08:39.360 --> 08:39.920
Ah, shit.

08:39.920 --> 08:40.960
The printer's broken.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.960
Oh, what's wrong with the printer?

08:42.960 --> 08:44.000
Let me take a look at it.

08:44.000 --> 08:44.880
Yeah, that's broken.

08:44.880 --> 08:45.840
Oh, you got a jam.

08:45.840 --> 08:46.640
Just got a little jam.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.440
We got a little toner bone going on here.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.640
I'm gonna fix this right up.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.240
Got a little on my shirt.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.600
That's not like the old shirt.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.040
Why don't you just get that screen

08:55.040 --> 08:57.120
and just read it out loud to the whole office.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.640
I'll get everybody to shut on down.

09:00.640 --> 09:01.920
Hey, everybody.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.160
Philip's gonna read this real important email

09:04.160 --> 09:06.800
about not eating people's lunch out of the fridge.

09:09.920 --> 09:10.640
Go ahead.

09:10.640 --> 09:11.440
Go ahead, Philip.

09:11.440 --> 09:14.000
As we say in the jazz world, the stage is yours.

09:16.320 --> 09:16.800
Come on.

09:17.520 --> 09:17.920
Go on.

09:17.920 --> 09:18.560
Don't hold back.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.320
Does anybody want some?

09:20.320 --> 09:21.040
I like your rhythm.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.640
That's a good cadence, Philip.

09:22.640 --> 09:23.920
Anybody want some of this, Jay?

09:25.920 --> 09:27.840
Why y'all grimacing at me?

09:28.720 --> 09:30.960
I do want to apologize for bringing my infant son

09:30.960 --> 09:32.000
into the office again.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.360
Poor little...

09:33.360 --> 09:34.560
The baby, Sarah, canceled.

09:34.560 --> 09:37.040
So poor little Grimace had to come along with me.

09:37.040 --> 09:37.680
Plum tuckered out.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.200
I did name him after McDonald's.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.360
Hey, anybody want up on this spliff tannin?

09:45.280 --> 09:45.920
Now, what's that?

09:45.920 --> 09:48.400
You'd prefer I not return tomorrow?

09:48.400 --> 09:50.000
Well, that is, of course, your choice.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.200
Well, I will hate to not live up to my contribution,

09:56.560 --> 09:58.960
but I understand sometimes it just don't work out.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.800
It ain't the way of the world.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.400
And now let me sing you this song I wrote

10:02.400 --> 10:04.000
about a situation just like this.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.240
I know this little song just like this

10:06.240 --> 10:08.080
about a little old caterpillar

10:08.080 --> 10:11.120
just wants to fill up his stores with grain.

10:11.920 --> 10:15.360
So he plays his fiddle all winter

10:15.360 --> 10:17.920
and then the chicken comes along and tries to eat his grain.

10:17.920 --> 10:18.800
I'll just be gone.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.920
You're like, there's no need to call security.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.040
It's best I go now.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.600
Do you have a box I can put all my accoutrement?

10:26.800 --> 10:28.400
Actually, I just have this pin.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.280
So I'm just going to take...

10:29.280 --> 10:30.960
Whoa, you're being a little rough, sir.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.000
There's no need for that.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.320
I'll find my way to the elevator.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.200
No problem at all.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.760
I did want to hear the end of Philip's email.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.440
Go ahead, Philip.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.160
Philip, you don't have to just sit there staring.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.680
Why y'all crying?

10:45.680 --> 10:46.880
Why is everybody crying?

10:46.880 --> 10:48.480
Philip, maybe you could forward that to me.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.760
I do not own a computer.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.440
I will read it at the library.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.240
And again, I do want to apologize to everybody

10:56.240 --> 10:58.160
for me not wearing pants or underwear

10:58.880 --> 11:00.160
into the office today.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.800
I don't even believe I work here now that I look back on it.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.240
Come to think of it, this is Denny's.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.480
So I am sorry about this.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.880
This thing I've been typing on, it's been a placemat.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.960
I do understand why my employment is being terminated.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.680
That is not a picture of my wife and kids.

11:17.680 --> 11:18.800
That is eggs.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.960
I work in a haunted building.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.600
It used to be a hospital,

11:25.600 --> 11:28.560
which has since been turned into a retirement home.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.120
Many of the employees have encountered weird things

11:31.120 --> 11:33.360
like whispering in the ear when they're alone

11:33.360 --> 11:35.920
and see reflections in the glass and no one's behind them.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.440
Even to the extreme of an employee

11:37.440 --> 11:39.920
getting thrown against the wall, which somebody saw.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.880
The problem is that I don't believe in any of that stuff,

11:42.880 --> 11:43.680
but I want to.

11:43.680 --> 11:47.360
How can I convince whatever is haunting my work

11:47.360 --> 11:48.800
to prove they exist to me?

11:48.800 --> 11:52.000
That's from wanting to believe in Thunder Bay, Ontario.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.880
If you say stuff like,

11:54.880 --> 12:00.560
I'm just one day away from retirement from hospital work.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.600
Yes, if you say,

12:04.080 --> 12:06.720
I hope no one eats this ghost food I laid out,

12:07.760 --> 12:08.960
then that is a pretty sure way to get them.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.160
Now specifically, Justin, can you,

12:10.160 --> 12:14.640
because I know that you had a brief ghost hunter phase.

12:14.640 --> 12:18.240
What kind of food are we talking about?

12:19.440 --> 12:21.120
Okay, well, ghost combos.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.000
Is that the ghost of combos or combos of combos?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.160
So when you eat combos.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.120
Okay, so you get a bowl, you fill it with combos.

12:31.120 --> 12:33.520
You eat all the combos in that bowl.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.200
But you got to make sure

12:37.200 --> 12:38.720
that you leave the combos there long enough

12:38.720 --> 12:40.400
for the energy to soak into the air.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.280
Sure, the spectral residue from these combos.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.440
How come that's not on the fucking bag of ingredients?

12:45.440 --> 12:48.320
What if my kid's allergic to spectral combo residue?

12:49.520 --> 12:50.960
Thanks for nothing, General Mills.

12:50.960 --> 12:51.520
My kid's dead.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.960
The other important thing is you have to eat them

12:52.960 --> 12:55.840
as violently as possible to be sure to leave behind the spirit.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.120
It's best if they have an unrequited love, too.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.360
They need some sort of unfinished business.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.440
One of the combos is maybe going to go to college,

13:03.440 --> 13:04.240
you know, something like that.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.280
Man, fuck.

13:05.280 --> 13:10.800
How come as many times as I've seen chickens killed on TV,

13:11.360 --> 13:15.280
I've never seen a ostrich decapitated with machete?

13:15.840 --> 13:18.000
Can you imagine how sweet that would be?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I feel like that's a Mythbusters waiting to happen.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.760
Yeah, here's a myth.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.200
That would be awesome.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.640
Why would that be awesome?

13:25.200 --> 13:26.880
Think about how long its neck is.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.120
There is a lot of neck there.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.000
Where would you cut?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.600
You have so many options.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.880
Like you could do like a back flip with a sword

13:34.880 --> 13:38.960
and chop it anywhere and that head's gonna come right off.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.280
You're saying it would look awesome.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.640
As long as we're doing that,

13:42.640 --> 13:44.000
then can we do the cartoon thing

13:44.000 --> 13:45.680
where they tie two flamingos together?

13:46.480 --> 13:46.960
I want to try that.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.640
What cartoon thing are you-

13:48.640 --> 13:50.560
They do that with flamingos all the time.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.440
I think it's in Alice in Wonderland.

13:53.440 --> 13:56.880
What avian cartoon snuff films are you watching?

13:58.560 --> 14:00.880
And by the way, we haven't properly addressed the fact

14:00.880 --> 14:04.000
that Justin wants to cut an ostrich's goddamn head off.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.160
I was trying to steer the conversation away from that.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.480
Away from the fact that our brother's a serial killer.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.480
It would just be fun.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.240
I don't want to do it.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.000
I'm saying I want to see it on YouTube.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.240
They are beautiful regal birds.

14:16.240 --> 14:20.880
They're basically super swans is what they are.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.080
They're mega swans.

14:22.640 --> 14:28.720
I think if you have something with that long of a neck,

14:28.720 --> 14:31.760
it is just begging to be decapitated.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.480
Do you think that somewhere like God or the creator of whatever

14:34.480 --> 14:35.520
is sitting around going like,

14:35.520 --> 14:38.160
I can't believe nobody's decapitated those birds yet.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.040
I gave it to them.

14:39.040 --> 14:39.920
That was a gimmick.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.680
Did you just get theological on us?

14:43.680 --> 14:47.680
Whatever supreme being created ostriches

14:47.680 --> 14:48.560
obviously made them for blood sport.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.880
I didn't want to alienate the Venn diagram of people

14:50.880 --> 14:52.240
that both don't believe in God,

14:52.240 --> 14:53.920
but also want to see ostriches killed.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.000
I didn't want to alienate them.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.360
When looking for a new apartment,

14:59.360 --> 15:02.800
I asked the realtor if the house I was looking at was haunted.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.040
She said she isn't legally allowed to talk about that.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.360
Is that code for yes?

15:07.360 --> 15:09.120
It makes me nervous because I get the vibe

15:09.120 --> 15:10.400
Virginia can be pretty haunted.

15:13.200 --> 15:13.680
Sure.

15:13.680 --> 15:18.160
So Ohio is for lovers when Virginia is for lovers

15:18.160 --> 15:20.240
who killed each other in a terrible passion.

15:22.080 --> 15:22.800
Oh my God.

15:23.360 --> 15:24.320
God, I hope that's true.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.800
I hope that when you're getting your realtor's license,

15:26.800 --> 15:29.840
it's like you can tell them about the bathrooms,

15:29.840 --> 15:31.280
talk about the hardwood floors.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.800
If they ask about ghosts,

15:32.800 --> 15:34.560
legally, you must be ambiguous.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.560
Legally, I don't think they can talk about

15:36.560 --> 15:38.640
if somebody was murdered in the house,

15:38.640 --> 15:40.160
which is the number of ghosts.

15:40.160 --> 15:42.240
Don't just fucking wander from house to house.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.560
Oh, it seems like a pretty good place to set up ghost shop.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.200
Check out two and a half bath for how much?

15:47.200 --> 15:48.080
Is that a day?

15:48.080 --> 15:49.360
That's going to feel good on my ghost.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.680
Oh, it's got like a pool grotto thing.

15:51.680 --> 15:57.360
Yeah, I love the idea that the first week of realtor school

15:57.360 --> 16:02.800
is prices and like cleaning the house and decoration.

16:02.800 --> 16:06.480
And the second week is ghosts and ghost related questions.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.760
Like, listen, today we're going to deal with a sensitive topic

16:09.760 --> 16:11.920
of if you are asked about ghosts.

16:12.480 --> 16:16.640
Is it possible that they just actually have a week

16:16.640 --> 16:18.480
called smart ass visitors?

16:18.480 --> 16:20.960
Yeah, and it's just things that you say to people

16:20.960 --> 16:23.280
who are smart asses that come to look at your house.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.560
Have you guys ever seen a ghost?

16:26.160 --> 16:26.720
Oh, man.

16:27.440 --> 16:28.560
Wow, just went right for it.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.560
Before we spend an hour talking about

16:32.560 --> 16:34.640
what Yahoo thinks about ghosts,

16:34.640 --> 16:38.240
we should really dig deep and do some spiritual exploration.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.120
Are we being real talk?

16:41.120 --> 16:42.160
I might still be drunk.

16:42.960 --> 16:43.680
Is this real talk?

16:43.680 --> 16:44.720
Are we doing real talk ghosts?

16:45.840 --> 16:47.680
I don't know, Travis.

16:47.680 --> 16:48.560
I don't know, Travis.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.560
Can you make it funny or will it be sad?

16:51.200 --> 16:52.000
I'll be sad.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.360
I want to hear.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.400
Oh, now you have to.

16:54.400 --> 16:54.800
Sorry.

16:54.800 --> 16:55.920
Let me clear mine up.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.520
No, because ghosts are real.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.320
Go on, Travis.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.280
I mean, neither of us.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.800
Like, listen, neither of us.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.880
Hey, listen, we're all friends here.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.080
Let's all just be straight.

17:04.080 --> 17:05.920
Let's just put our ghosts on the table.

17:05.920 --> 17:06.960
No, I've seen no ghosts.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.120
I also ain't afraid of no ghost.

17:09.120 --> 17:09.360
Okay.

17:11.200 --> 17:15.840
But I do have a certain belief that,

17:15.840 --> 17:20.000
that, not in ghosts, but that, like, if something really tragic

17:20.000 --> 17:22.080
or, like, really horrific happens in a place,

17:22.080 --> 17:24.800
that there is, like, really bad juju there.

17:24.800 --> 17:25.760
You know what I mean?

17:25.760 --> 17:29.680
Like, if you, I mean, I'm sure it's all purely, like, psychological

17:29.680 --> 17:30.800
and you're telling yourself that.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.320
But, like, you know, you've walked into, like, the Moundsville prison

17:34.320 --> 17:38.800
and, like, the Lincoln State Hospital that we went to in Point Pleasant.

17:38.800 --> 17:42.720
Like, you walk in and you're like, something bad happened here.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.600
Like, is that just me?

17:43.600 --> 17:44.560
Bad psychic energy?

17:44.560 --> 17:46.480
No, but I think a lot of that's aesthetics.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.320
Yeah, that's true, too.

17:48.320 --> 17:51.360
You very rarely, like, walk into a Macy's and you're like,

17:51.360 --> 17:53.600
huh, something bad happened here.

17:53.600 --> 17:54.400
Mm-hmm.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.440
Griffith, where are you at?

17:55.440 --> 17:59.520
You know, the ghosts I don't like that I really double don't believe in

17:59.520 --> 18:02.240
are ghosts that have repeatable behavior patterns.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.760
Oh, the ones that are like, every night she appears on the stairs.

18:05.760 --> 18:06.800
Yeah, she stands in the road, she hitchhikes.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.120
She's probably a ghost, but I had to live on a schedule still.

18:09.120 --> 18:09.520
I would be a bum.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.480
Fuck that.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.560
Yeah, I can float through anything.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.120
Yeah, no, I'm going to go be a hedonist.

18:15.120 --> 18:15.440
Thanks.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.560
Yeah, see, I'm going to go to the babes palace.

18:18.560 --> 18:22.320
Yeah, I'd haunt you, but I'd want to just, like, rub up against money.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.760
All the money in this bank.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.560
That feeling that you get, though, because you did say you get a feeling

18:26.560 --> 18:28.800
when you wander into a place where a murder happened.

18:28.800 --> 18:32.640
There have been two trillion people, 60 trillion people,

18:32.640 --> 18:34.960
that have walked the earth at any given point.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.920
Well, not at any given point, on all the points put together.

18:37.920 --> 18:42.080
Do you, everybody, there's not a square foot of this entire planet

18:42.080 --> 18:43.920
where somebody hasn't been horribly murdered.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.440
You don't know that.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.720
I know that for sure.

18:46.720 --> 18:50.320
Yeah, think about, if you think about all the people who've ever been alive.

18:50.320 --> 18:51.360
Law of large numbers.

18:51.360 --> 18:53.680
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

18:53.680 --> 18:58.800
Now, I also, I also have to state that one of my personal heroes is Harry Houdini,

18:58.800 --> 19:01.680
who is one of, like, the biggest debunkers in history.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.280
And so I don't believe in ghosts.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.880
I believe in Harry Houdini.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.480
But he died.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.840
He died, so he can't be all that great.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.160
Fair enough, Griffin, fair enough.

19:12.160 --> 19:16.320
I mean, there probably are, we're probably not on point earlier

19:16.320 --> 19:19.200
when we're talking about how ghosts go to live

19:19.200 --> 19:22.480
in the dopest situation they can float into.

19:22.480 --> 19:26.160
I imagine that ghosts, like regular people, like living people,

19:26.720 --> 19:29.360
they have different wants and needs and desires,

19:29.360 --> 19:32.080
and maybe some ghosts are like Jeffert,

19:32.080 --> 19:37.120
and they, you know, they appreciate the coziness of a bagel.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.800
So you're saying, like, maybe this is, like, the ghost of Jeffert Sr.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.640
And he's just like, I feel comfortable here.

19:44.640 --> 19:45.360
I like you here.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.560
I feel comfortable here.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.200
I know this place.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.480
This is where my armchair is.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.240
I get to watch my son dip.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.200
I love it.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.120
I've buried a skull in the front yard,

19:53.120 --> 19:55.840
and I can't go until you find my secret skull stash.

19:55.840 --> 20:00.560
Now, Griffin, I'm curious.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.200
In the fiction you've stitched together here-

20:03.200 --> 20:03.760
Not fiction.

20:03.760 --> 20:04.320
Go on, though.

20:05.200 --> 20:08.000
Why does Jeffert bury the skull?

20:08.000 --> 20:08.320
What is it?

20:08.320 --> 20:09.200
Jeffert didn't.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.000
Jeffert's dead dad buried his secret skull stash.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.760
Jeffert Sr. the elder Jeffert.

20:14.720 --> 20:15.360
The elder Jeff-

20:15.360 --> 20:15.840
Jeffert the elder.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.760
The elder Jeffert buried his secret skull stash in the yard.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.480
And it's, guys, it's enormous.

20:22.480 --> 20:26.640
It's a repository of sweet, difficult tobaccos.

20:26.640 --> 20:30.560
We're talking about hundreds of dollars worth of skull.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.280
And he can't leave this earth until Jeffert finds it.

20:34.720 --> 20:35.760
So is Jeff-

20:35.760 --> 20:36.640
So when we're talking about-

20:36.640 --> 20:38.560
Have you guys seen No Country for Old Men?

20:38.560 --> 20:39.840
It's basically this.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.960
This is what I'm describing to you is the sequel.

20:44.640 --> 20:45.440
Skull Buddies.

20:46.720 --> 20:47.600
Skull Hunters.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.240
Skull Hunters.

20:50.240 --> 20:53.120
That would be a pretty good plot for a new City Slickers movie.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.240
If anybody's in the market for one of those.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.520
The legend of Pearly Skull.

20:57.280 --> 21:00.880
The legend of Jeffert Sr. the elder Jeffert's skull.

21:02.320 --> 21:03.040
I'd watch that.

21:03.040 --> 21:03.680
Hey.

21:03.680 --> 21:09.600
So Yahoo Answers user emmy875 and some other shit, I think.

21:09.600 --> 21:13.920
8750 said that ghosts can attach themselves to anyone or anything.

21:13.920 --> 21:18.080
They could have died on the land or a road nearby and claim that trailer home.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.360
Doesn't that fucking suck?

21:20.480 --> 21:21.440
Doesn't that fucking-

21:22.240 --> 21:28.080
If it was me and I died, I would be careening towards the 18-wheeler.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.400
I would get Google Maps out real quick and just be like,

21:30.400 --> 21:31.440
where am I going to fucking-

21:31.440 --> 21:32.960
Aw, god damn it.

21:35.200 --> 21:39.840
I couldn't go careening off the Hollywood hills and fucking chill with Will Smith

21:39.840 --> 21:40.960
for the rest of eternity.

21:40.960 --> 21:41.920
That's just great.

21:42.480 --> 21:43.680
Good twist of fate.

21:43.680 --> 21:48.480
They- Is the person saying that as they're driving past this place they died

21:49.120 --> 21:50.320
and that's how it happened?

21:50.320 --> 21:51.200
That's how it happened.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.960
You go to the nearest residence.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.560
The nearest hauntable thing.

21:55.760 --> 21:58.160
This is why you guys, if you're going to get murdered,

21:58.160 --> 22:02.720
have a conversation with your murderer first and maybe try to negotiate the spot.

22:04.240 --> 22:08.320
Don't let him kill you in the middle of a downtown sketchy place.

22:08.320 --> 22:12.320
If you could get a realtor to go along with the murderer

22:12.320 --> 22:16.880
just to show off a few places and how it would be good for ghosts.

22:17.520 --> 22:22.160
I actually have a living murder will that is a legally binding document.

22:22.160 --> 22:25.120
It took a while to set up, but basically it states that

22:25.120 --> 22:32.720
if you are going to murder me, you need to take me to within a hauntable distance.

22:32.720 --> 22:35.360
There has to be a Starbucks nearby and it has to be Jeff Goldblum's house.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.000
You got the signature of the head of the Assassin's Guild?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.680
Yeah, I got him to sign off on it.

22:39.680 --> 22:43.280
He agrees, so it's top-down, it's official.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.880
Wow, good work.

22:44.880 --> 22:49.200
Do you guys think Wi-Fi, is Wi-Fi important to ghosts, do you think?

22:50.080 --> 22:52.880
Like a good strong Wi-Fi, like real fab pipes.

22:53.920 --> 22:58.960
I think it becomes hard to distinguish yourself from the Wi-Fi signal.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.840
I think that at some point the ghost is just like Johnny Mnemonic.

23:01.840 --> 23:02.480
That's a good point.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.200
Fully plugged in.

23:03.760 --> 23:07.360
Yeah, but can you imagine the problem that old people have

23:07.360 --> 23:08.960
like figuring out new technology?

23:08.960 --> 23:11.760
Can you imagine being like a ghost in like a thousand years from now

23:11.760 --> 23:14.880
and trying to cope with like the new technological developments

23:14.880 --> 23:16.400
and you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what is this?

23:16.400 --> 23:19.600
Back in my day, I just floated in the pipes and carried myself around the internet.

23:20.640 --> 23:25.760
If I get fucking stuck haunting someplace for a thousand years, I'll be livid.

23:25.760 --> 23:29.120
Those local kids should have solved my puzzle by then.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.520
Okay, so Justin Griffin, if you die right now,

23:33.520 --> 23:36.720
what's your unfinished business that's going to keep you around as a ghost?

23:36.720 --> 23:39.600
Because mine is I haven't finished watching Walking Dead yet.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.800
I just gotta clear out my internet history.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.240
Gotta blast my cash.

23:46.240 --> 23:46.720
What?

23:46.720 --> 23:47.600
Did you hear that?

23:47.600 --> 23:50.880
Blast my cash, please.

23:52.240 --> 23:55.040
I try to go incognito, but sometimes I forget.

23:55.040 --> 23:59.440
Blast my cash, set me free.

23:59.440 --> 24:00.560
Press control H.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.760
It's telling us to review his cash.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.840
No, press control H.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.840
Check all the boxes and go.

24:07.840 --> 24:08.800
Set me free.

24:08.800 --> 24:09.840
Blast my cash.

24:14.880 --> 24:18.880
Shrink the window down in case some words show up that don't.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.680
Please.

24:21.680 --> 24:22.640
Grandson.

24:29.440 --> 24:30.320
I am.

24:30.320 --> 24:36.000
I actually need to master the fushigi, but I'm gonna need human hands to do it.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.520
Someone need a willing host.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.120
A sort of Whoopi Goldberg situation.

24:40.080 --> 24:46.000
Where I can through her hands master the ancient art of contact juggling.

24:47.680 --> 24:51.520
Can I read the best Yahoo answer response I've ever seen on the platform?

24:52.400 --> 24:53.280
Yes, please.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.080
By all means.

24:54.080 --> 24:56.000
Yahoo Answers user Bill C. responded,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.560
Oh boy, you don't know you already are a ghost.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.640
All of your friends are ghosts too.

25:00.640 --> 25:02.800
No, just kidding with you.

25:02.800 --> 25:06.640
However, as you grow and mature, your goals and thoughts will change.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.140
Thanks.

25:09.360 --> 25:11.120
Thanks, President Obama.

25:11.120 --> 25:12.400
Who is that from?

25:12.400 --> 25:13.280
President Obama.

25:13.280 --> 25:13.840
Bill C.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.520
Might be President Bill Clinton.

25:15.520 --> 25:16.160
Bill Clinton.

25:16.720 --> 25:19.760
Hey, this shit's dumb, but don't worry.

25:19.760 --> 25:20.400
We've all been there.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.720
Eventually you'll grow up and you won't be such a dumbass.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.560
You're gonna grow out of this real dumb shit.

25:25.280 --> 25:25.920
Oh God.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.400
Didn't you know?

25:28.400 --> 25:29.040
You're a ghost.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.000
All your friends are ghosts.

25:30.000 --> 25:30.960
Listen, just playing.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.760
Listen, I need you to know that this looks serious.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.920
You can actually tell the moment in that response

25:35.920 --> 25:38.960
when the person turns their chair around and straddles it.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.160
Hey, let's get real talk.

25:41.440 --> 25:44.880
We're gonna have a lot of fun today pretending that everyone you know is dead,

25:44.880 --> 25:47.520
but let's talk about how you're gonna grow up and change.

25:47.520 --> 25:48.080
Let's wrap.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.440
Let's wrap.

25:49.440 --> 25:53.840
Listen, your school brought me in today to talk to you guys about the fact that you're dumbasses.

25:53.840 --> 25:58.000
Do you guys want to see me play some stunt volleyball and talk to you about drugs?

25:59.680 --> 26:01.280
Also, all your friends are dead.

26:01.280 --> 26:03.520
Not really because I just sunk this basketball shot,

26:03.520 --> 26:06.160
but now let me tell you about how you're all gonna grow up and not be so stupid.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.120
Pick 85 people.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.040
I will stunt basketball against them solo.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.680
You are gonna love this, but you shouldn't love heroin.

26:11.680 --> 26:12.400
Take it from me.

26:12.400 --> 26:13.200
I used to do heroin.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.440
That's how I got so good at volleyball.

26:15.440 --> 26:19.520
Sometimes I'm in a long room or hallway

26:19.520 --> 26:24.320
and I will not turn the lights on on one end

26:24.320 --> 26:27.840
because I'm just gonna be walking through.

26:28.480 --> 26:32.080
And about halfway through, I will regret it because it's dark.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.360
And I'll get like so, so pooped.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.120
Like way pooped out.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.080
And then-

26:38.080 --> 26:41.440
When you say that, do you literally mean so scared that you defecate?

26:42.080 --> 26:43.920
Like so scared.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.480
No, I mean like I'm a grown man, but I would pee pants.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.200
I get so scared.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.000
You guys ever do that?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.760
You're in like a dark hallway or something.

26:51.760 --> 26:52.720
Oh yeah, all the time.

26:52.720 --> 26:53.760
Like halfway through, you're like,

26:53.760 --> 26:55.440
oh shit, oh shit, I know it.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.160
I know it's on.

26:56.160 --> 27:00.560
I'm routinely going into warehouses and like old shops and stuff.

27:00.560 --> 27:01.760
Yes, I do that quite often.

27:01.760 --> 27:04.400
Can I tell you guys another place I just thought of that's way better

27:04.400 --> 27:06.000
that you definitely don't want to see a ghost?

27:06.000 --> 27:06.640
Yeah.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.080
At the bottom of a pool.

27:08.880 --> 27:09.520
Oh no.

27:10.240 --> 27:11.200
No, no, no.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.520
You go down with your mask and the ghost is like,

27:15.520 --> 27:16.880
gurgle, gurgle, ghost.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.560
No.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.880
It's a ghost in the pool.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.560
You reach the bottom level of a building.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.840
The elevated doors open.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.200
Ghost right there in front of the elevator.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.240
Let me get you with this.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.800
It's the opening night of a movie, midnight movie,

27:30.800 --> 27:33.280
and you just waited in line and get a big tub of popcorn

27:33.920 --> 27:36.320
and you get it and it takes you 20 minutes to get it

27:36.320 --> 27:39.040
and you paid $8 for it, right?

27:39.680 --> 27:42.800
You know, it's so expensive and then you take it back to your seat

27:42.800 --> 27:44.480
and you got to work your way through the aisle.

27:44.480 --> 27:46.080
Excuse me, excuse me.

27:46.080 --> 27:48.240
And then you get back to your seat and you look down

27:48.240 --> 27:49.600
and it's not popcorn.

27:49.600 --> 27:50.800
It's just a ghost.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.600
Oh man, that you have to go all the way back up.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.200
And you have to wait in line for 20 minutes

27:57.200 --> 27:58.800
because they can't let you skip and you get there

27:58.800 --> 28:01.120
and you're like, excuse me, you gave me a ghost.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.400
And then they say, no, I didn't.

28:02.400 --> 28:05.120
And you look down and you look down and it's popcorn.

28:07.120 --> 28:07.760
Shivered.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.120
Shivered.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.560
I am fully shivered at this point.

28:10.560 --> 28:11.360
Okay, imagine this.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.360
You've been looking for a new car for three months.

28:13.360 --> 28:13.680
I love it.

28:13.680 --> 28:14.400
You shopped around.

28:14.400 --> 28:14.720
Okay.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.720
You've gone through all the different financing options.

28:16.720 --> 28:19.120
You weren't sure at first because you wanted like a two door,

28:19.120 --> 28:20.640
but then they started showing you the four doors

28:20.640 --> 28:22.240
and you're really happy with one of them.

28:22.240 --> 28:23.280
And so it's been months.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.640
You got all your financing in order.

28:24.640 --> 28:25.600
You pick the right colors.

28:25.600 --> 28:26.800
You know the car you want.

28:26.800 --> 28:27.680
You buy it.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.200
As you're driving off the lot,

28:29.200 --> 28:31.120
you open the glove compartment ghost.

28:31.120 --> 28:31.760
Check this out.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.840
Check this spooky story.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.280
You wait in line at Starbucks.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.760
You're waiting and waiting and waiting.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.600
And then you wait and then you wait.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.680
And then you get to the front and you say,

28:41.680 --> 28:44.640
I want a grande salted caramel mocha

28:44.640 --> 28:47.440
and a benty skinny salted caramel mocha

28:47.440 --> 28:50.080
and oatmeal with brown sugar and nuts

28:50.080 --> 28:53.200
and pumpkin bread and pumpkin muffin.

28:53.200 --> 28:56.240
And then you reach and then he says it's going to be 1978

28:56.240 --> 28:58.800
and you reach in your pocket and to get your wallet.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.480
But what's in there is actually a ghost.

29:00.480 --> 29:01.520
Oh my God.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.120
I just flipped my popcorn over.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.040
You just got shamed.

29:05.040 --> 29:05.760
I bet this one.

29:05.760 --> 29:08.240
You go to a party and because your friends say

29:08.240 --> 29:10.160
that you're going to know a bunch of people there

29:10.160 --> 29:12.320
and you get to it and you don't actually know.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.480
You don't actually know that many people there.

29:14.480 --> 29:16.400
And then maybe there's a ghost or something.

29:18.160 --> 29:18.800
Imagine this.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.280
Okay, so like you've been marinating like this roast

29:21.280 --> 29:23.840
in your crock pot for like, I would say like a 20 hours.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.120
Like a real slow roast, right?

29:25.120 --> 29:25.600
Oh my God.

29:25.600 --> 29:26.800
And you've been building up because you're going to have

29:26.800 --> 29:27.760
a dinner party that night.

29:27.760 --> 29:28.240
Okay.

29:28.240 --> 29:28.480
Right.

29:28.480 --> 29:30.720
And then you open the crock pot

29:30.720 --> 29:32.640
and you didn't put enough liquids in

29:32.640 --> 29:34.320
and now the whole thing's dried out.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.080
And suddenly the doorbell rings and you open

29:36.080 --> 29:36.720
and there's a ghost.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.800
And he wants to tell you about Jesus.

29:40.800 --> 29:41.520
That was good.

29:41.520 --> 29:42.640
That was good.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.160
That was good.

29:44.160 --> 29:44.880
Check this out.

29:44.880 --> 29:45.200
All right.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.040
Voting day.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.040
You vote, go to the polls.

29:49.040 --> 29:53.040
You go and you vote and you drive home

29:53.040 --> 29:55.120
and you have some dinner

29:55.120 --> 29:57.120
and then you wait for the results to come in.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.680
And then at the end of the night,

30:00.240 --> 30:04.000
you're looking at Mitt Romney, 20%.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.280
Barack Obama, 20%.

30:08.480 --> 30:08.880
60%.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.520
60% landslide win.

30:11.520 --> 30:12.000
A ghost.

30:12.000 --> 30:12.800
Oh God, no.

30:12.800 --> 30:15.600
We've elected our first ghost president

30:15.600 --> 30:18.560
of the United States of Spooktacular America.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.200
Yeah, and you know he's not pro-life.

30:21.200 --> 30:22.480
We're not letting them ghosts vote.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.000
We give them ghosts the right to vote

30:24.000 --> 30:25.600
and they're going to elect a ghost every time.

30:25.600 --> 30:25.920
Yeah.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.520
Hey, hey ghost.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.360
Why can't we see the death certificate?

30:29.360 --> 30:36.400
What's a good pet name for an uncle?

30:38.880 --> 30:41.840
What's the role or title in other languages?

30:41.840 --> 30:42.400
Slangs?

30:43.440 --> 30:45.760
Is there a difference whether your uncle

30:45.760 --> 30:48.080
is from your dad's side or your mom's side?

30:48.080 --> 30:51.280
Include things like when kinders and kids,

30:52.000 --> 30:55.440
when kinders and kids mess up the pronunciation

30:55.440 --> 30:57.520
and it comes out like my anki.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.760
Got a fave pet name for your fave uncle?

30:59.760 --> 31:01.120
I hate this so much.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.040
Do you guys know my favorite pet name

31:05.040 --> 31:06.160
for one of our uncles?

31:06.800 --> 31:07.280
What?

31:07.280 --> 31:07.760
What's that?

31:07.760 --> 31:08.320
Mark.

31:09.840 --> 31:10.560
Dave.

31:10.560 --> 31:11.280
Dave.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.080
Adult Dave.

31:12.080 --> 31:12.560
Chris.

31:12.560 --> 31:17.200
Like, how do you, that person?

31:17.200 --> 31:18.960
Grown ass man, Mark.

31:18.960 --> 31:22.320
Grown ass Dr. Mark Wahlberg.

31:22.320 --> 31:25.280
Like, why, he's a fucking-

31:25.280 --> 31:26.320
Listen, uncle.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.040
Listen, uncle.

31:27.600 --> 31:31.120
Uncle Felipe, I've been wanting you and me to get closer,

31:31.120 --> 31:32.960
so I came up with a pet name for you.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.680
You're kind of chunky, so I'm gonna start calling you

31:35.680 --> 31:36.400
my chunkle.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.720
You're my chunkle now.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.200
Have you ever noticed that you have a body odor problem?

31:41.200 --> 31:42.720
From now on, you're my stunkle.

31:42.720 --> 31:43.440
Stunkle's not bad.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.320
You're my funkle.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.280
I used to live with a guy named Jacob Dunkle

31:48.240 --> 31:51.360
and his very name of which apparently makes Travis laugh.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.080
It does.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.280
I love Dunkle.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.280
I saw Dunkle come out of the Argo.

31:55.280 --> 31:55.680
Oh yeah?

31:55.680 --> 31:58.480
Did he like it?

31:58.480 --> 31:59.840
How many Dunkle stars did he give it?

32:01.280 --> 32:02.160
He didn't give any.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.200
He did say that you need to respond to his Facebook messages

32:05.200 --> 32:07.120
because he said you kind of left him hanging on a few of those.

32:07.120 --> 32:08.720
Oh man, he said it like four months ago.

32:08.720 --> 32:09.600
I feel, I-

32:09.600 --> 32:11.040
Dunkle, I'm sorry if you're listening.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.160
If you're listening and you probably aren't-

32:12.160 --> 32:12.800
He keeps up.

32:12.800 --> 32:13.760
He told me he listens.

32:13.760 --> 32:14.080
Yeah.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.840
So now you have no excuse.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.160
Anyway, he has to like enjoy things

32:18.160 --> 32:20.080
and then say that they were a slammed dunkle, right?

32:20.080 --> 32:21.440
Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.760
But he, I can't remember if this actually happened

32:23.760 --> 32:24.880
or if we just wanted it to happen.

32:24.880 --> 32:28.240
Like for him to have a sibling that had a child

32:28.240 --> 32:30.080
and then he would be Funky Uncle Dunkle

32:30.080 --> 32:33.360
or Funky Unky Dunky or any combination of those three things.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.280
Funky Unky Dunky.

32:41.920 --> 32:42.800
Oh God.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.680
My Uncle Nemo, we lovingly call Unk.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.120
It makes it sound like a caveman.

32:51.120 --> 32:51.680
I like that too.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.040
He is a Cro-Magnon.

32:53.040 --> 32:56.320
Hey, did you, so who's bringing what for Thanksgiving?

32:56.320 --> 32:58.560
Well, I'm bringing the Pecan Sandies

32:58.560 --> 33:00.480
and is anybody bringing cranberry?

33:00.480 --> 33:02.320
Oh yeah, we assigned that to-

33:06.080 --> 33:07.920
Hey everybody, Unk's here.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.360
Sorry, just stepped on a duck.

33:11.360 --> 33:11.680
Yeah.

33:11.680 --> 33:14.080
Just so I could double check in your fiction,

33:14.080 --> 33:19.120
is someone buying a package of Nabisco Pecan Sandies

33:19.120 --> 33:23.280
and thinks that's a sufficient Thanksgiving offering?

33:23.280 --> 33:24.480
That's how he's set with Asai.

33:25.040 --> 33:26.720
And what's Steve bringing?

33:26.720 --> 33:28.800
He's bringing Pecan Sandies again.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.720
I think if someone's going to bring Pecan Sandies,

33:30.720 --> 33:31.680
it's going to be Unk

33:31.680 --> 33:33.600
because he does not sound like somebody

33:33.600 --> 33:35.360
who is graced with color just yet.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.280
He's just going to pull one out of the back of his van

33:37.280 --> 33:39.440
where he just has stacks and stacks of packages

33:39.440 --> 33:41.120
of Pecan Sandies that he bought

33:41.120 --> 33:42.640
when the Piggly Wiggly down the street

33:42.640 --> 33:43.840
was going out of business.

33:43.840 --> 33:46.480
Just so I'm clear, is Unk actually Encino Man?

33:46.480 --> 33:49.360
To be fair, Unk is not really related

33:49.360 --> 33:51.520
to either my mother or my father.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.880
He's more of a friend of the family,

33:52.880 --> 33:54.000
by which I mean a bear.

33:54.000 --> 33:54.640
Okay.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.880
This has been the greatest Thanksgiving of my life,

34:00.880 --> 34:03.600
except for when that bear tore my arm off.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.280
But God, I love my Unk.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.520
Excuse me, Unk Jr., son of Unk.

34:10.080 --> 34:14.320
His forearms are just as powerful as the original Unk,

34:14.320 --> 34:15.600
make no mistake.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.240
His large claws have torn all our tapestries,

34:18.240 --> 34:19.360
but we love him very much.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.120
But they've also torn down the emotional walls

34:21.120 --> 34:22.480
that was keeping my family apart.

34:24.720 --> 34:26.320
You know, we went three Christmas sets

34:26.320 --> 34:28.240
without speaking until Unk showed up.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.480
They say a bear's strength knows no limits,

34:30.480 --> 34:32.480
and we finally put that to the test

34:32.480 --> 34:34.080
when we used it to rebuild our home

34:34.080 --> 34:35.360
and by which we mean our love.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.280
He was strong enough to hold his family together.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.480
You lay off Unk.

34:41.760 --> 34:44.400
Every year at Thanksgiving, he brings honey.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.240
And we love him for that.

34:46.240 --> 34:49.040
And he always pushes it forward a little shyly,

34:49.040 --> 34:51.200
as if to say, this is all I could do.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.720
And God damn it, you've done enough.

34:53.360 --> 34:56.320
He and his son always talk about how they like to wipe their ass

34:56.320 --> 34:57.920
with like really soft paper.

34:57.920 --> 34:58.400
I hate it.

35:00.240 --> 35:00.720
I hate it.

35:01.360 --> 35:01.760
You know what?

35:01.760 --> 35:03.680
He missed my wedding because he got captured

35:03.680 --> 35:04.880
and sent to the zoo.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.480
But I wasn't angry at him.

35:06.480 --> 35:19.680
How could I say anything?

35:19.680 --> 35:20.160
Hey, everybody.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.920
This is Griffin McElroy, your baby brother.

35:21.920 --> 35:25.280
And thanks for sticking with us as we do a best of episode.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.880
Justin and Travis are both on vacation.

35:27.600 --> 35:28.720
And we figured, hey, it's been a while

35:28.720 --> 35:30.160
since we've done a bros better bros best.

35:30.160 --> 35:33.200
So we are putting one up so that they can enjoy their beach time

35:33.200 --> 35:36.640
and I can enjoy my hurricane.

35:36.640 --> 35:40.960
So here's some Jumbotron stuff and some advertisement stuff.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.560
First off, I want to tell you about Wink.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.320

35:52.880 --> 35:54.240
And what you're going to do on that website

35:54.240 --> 35:57.120
is you're going to take a brief palate profile quiz.

35:57.120 --> 35:59.760
And using that data, they're going to recommend some wines

all customized to your palate, which will be shipped directly to your door

36:13.040 --> 36:14.960
that are not available anywhere else.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.600
We've gotten some wines in here from Try Wink

36:17.600 --> 36:21.440
that we've been sort of savoring, enjoying with our dinner meals.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.200
And it's been real nice.

Also want to tell you about Harry's.

36:46.640 --> 36:50.160

37:23.840 --> 37:25.360
This one is very exciting.

37:25.360 --> 37:28.160
It's the Name of the Wind Art Deck.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.760
It's live now on Kickstarter.

37:29.760 --> 37:35.440
It's a beautiful deck of cards meticulously illustrated by artist Echo Chernick,

37:35.440 --> 37:39.360
featuring characters from the New York Times bestselling author Patrick Rothfuss,

37:39.360 --> 37:43.280
bestselling author and friend of the show and former guest Patrick Rothfuss,

37:44.160 --> 37:48.640
his novel The Name of the Wind, the first in the Kingkiller Chronicle series.

37:49.920 --> 37:53.760
Basically, this project features two collections of decks,

37:53.760 --> 37:57.440
each with two distinct decks that have matching backs but different face cards.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.680
So you choose your favorite characters from each of the decks,

37:59.680 --> 38:01.840
and you combine them to customize your deck with your favorites,

38:01.840 --> 38:04.960
all while having these two complete playable decks of cards.

38:05.520 --> 38:09.920
The Kickstarter exclusive Chandrian Collection is only available to Kickstarter backers

38:09.920 --> 38:12.960
and features two decks with a blue and black card back

38:12.960 --> 38:16.880
and a stunning black tuck box design with blue foil.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.440
There's also cameo appearances available.

38:19.440 --> 38:23.360
You can buy a cameo appearance in an original art print created by Echo Chernick

38:23.360 --> 38:29.840
and actually become part of the Adima-Ra troop with, that's right, us, the McElroy brothers.

38:30.480 --> 38:34.960
This is very, very exciting for me as a huge, huge fan of this novel series.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.400
I cannot wait to see how it turns out.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.800
So keep an eye out for when this print becomes unlocked

38:38.800 --> 38:43.600
so you can grab your spot in the art print under the open sky before they're all gone.

38:43.600 --> 38:49.040
The Kickstarter project is seeking $25,000 and it's currently over 1,000% funded.

38:49.040 --> 38:52.800
So if you want to get your hands on these cards and the exclusive edition,

38:52.800 --> 38:55.120
do not miss out on this awesome project.

38:55.760 --> 38:59.440
Just go to Kickstarter and search for the name of the wind art deck.

38:59.440 --> 39:00.400
That's how I found it.

39:00.400 --> 39:06.320
And that's how I am backing it literally right now as I am reading this.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.960
And okay, I've got a couple of Jumbotron spots here.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.360
The first one is for Rob and it's from Chelsea who says,

39:11.360 --> 39:14.480
hey buddy, we always have such a great time playing games,

39:14.480 --> 39:18.240
telling dumb jokes and making up ridiculously intricate theories about the adventure zone.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.200
Hopefully I've put most of those to bed at this point.

39:21.200 --> 39:24.720
I wanted it on the official podcast record that you are the best at everything you do.

39:24.720 --> 39:27.520
So I paid the brothers or brother to tell you.

39:27.520 --> 39:29.040
Brothers, he really is the best.

39:29.040 --> 39:29.600
I believe it.

39:30.240 --> 39:32.560
Here's to many more years of good goose.

39:32.560 --> 39:34.800
It's a very sweet message and now it's official.

39:34.800 --> 39:37.040
It's this every episode goes in the Library of Congress.

39:37.040 --> 39:41.520
So it's like government official that Rob is the best.

39:41.520 --> 39:45.360
Got another one here for Ed and it's from your courgette.

39:45.360 --> 39:46.720
Probably said that wrong.

39:46.720 --> 39:51.600
Sumi who says, happy friendiversary or whatever personal celebration is most relevant right now

39:51.600 --> 39:53.120
because of Jumbotron timing.

39:53.840 --> 39:57.920
Thanks for introducing me to Mabim Bam and the adventure zone and bubble baths.

39:58.640 --> 40:00.960
I hope you enjoy all of those simultaneously.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.640
I'm so glad that you're a part of my life.

40:02.640 --> 40:05.520
Here is to more delicious concoctions.

40:05.520 --> 40:07.040
Don't know why I said it like that.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.920
Deep and meaningfuls and unscrupulous fun.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.280
I appreciate you so much.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.680
We all appreciate you, Ed.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.080
I most of all.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.680
I've been waiting for the right time to tell you this.

40:17.680 --> 40:21.360
And it is right now as I do this ad break by myself.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.720
Thank you to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

40:24.720 --> 40:27.360

40:28.240 --> 40:30.080

You're gonna find something you like.

40:30.960 --> 40:31.680
I guarantee it.

40:31.680 --> 40:37.680

40:37.680 --> 40:38.640
Judge John Hodgman.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.040
So many great shows all at MaximumFun.org.

40:41.040 --> 40:44.400

40:44.400 --> 40:46.960
and check out all of our podcasts and video projects there.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.920
Big thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for these for a theme song

40:49.920 --> 40:51.920
It's a Departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

40:52.560 --> 40:55.360
It's a really, really great album that you should go pick up.

40:55.360 --> 40:57.840
Hey, I mentioned the hurricane earlier.

40:57.840 --> 41:00.960
And all joking aside, if you have the means, please consider helping out.

41:01.840 --> 41:03.280
Rachel and I have gotten a lot of messages.

41:03.280 --> 41:06.880
We live in Austin for people concerned and we're doing just fine.

41:07.600 --> 41:12.160
Austin did not catch the brunt of this, but there are lots of areas down on the coast

41:12.160 --> 41:18.000
and Houston that really could use some help if you can help.

41:18.800 --> 41:26.000
So consider supporting an organization like Portlite or the Red Cross or local food banks

41:26.000 --> 41:30.400
in Houston and Galveston and Corpus Christi and other coastal areas.

41:31.680 --> 41:33.680
There's the Greater Houston Community Fund.

41:33.680 --> 41:35.680
There are tons and tons of ways to get involved.

41:36.320 --> 41:39.360
Just go online and find out where you can put your support.

41:39.360 --> 41:42.960
And yeah, we try to get too serious on the show, but it's a serious thing that's happening.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.600
And please consider helping out if you can.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.240
I think that's it for right now.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.880
I'm going to let you get back to the rest of the best of episode.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.600
We will be back with another regular episode next week.

41:53.600 --> 42:22.400
Bye.

42:23.600 --> 42:29.720
you get your podcast from? Oh god, there's the rat. Oh god.

42:29.720 --> 42:33.480
Let's have another death question. This was sent in by Jacob Locker, so you know it's

42:33.480 --> 42:37.720
gonna be good. Thanks Jacob. It's by Yahoo Answers user Philip, who asks, how much would

42:37.720 --> 42:42.400
it cost to bronze my corpse when I die?

42:42.400 --> 42:47.640
The first answer is exactly $32,988, I guess.

42:47.640 --> 42:50.680
Is that including all the fees?

42:50.680 --> 42:58.520
I like this idea so much. For me, personally, let me tell you why.

42:58.520 --> 43:04.440
Just in case I ever do something awesome enough to merit a statue built in my honor, it's

43:04.440 --> 43:08.800
like, pre-pro. You know what I mean?

43:08.800 --> 43:12.320
They don't have to worry about, I would love to build this statue in Griffin's honor. I

43:12.320 --> 43:19.160
would love to. He was a very important figure for an important reason here. But I just don't

43:19.160 --> 43:22.720
know that we have the maintenance fees for it right now.

43:22.720 --> 43:27.800
With this, I can say, don't even worry about it. This is me, and maybe I'm standing up,

43:27.800 --> 43:31.400
maybe I have a piece of pizza in my hand that I also bronzed, and I'm given like a hang

43:31.400 --> 43:34.520
ten sign with my other hand.

43:34.520 --> 43:36.360
So kind of a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles pastiche.

43:36.360 --> 43:42.240
Maybe a little TMNT, perhaps. Maybe I have roller skates on. Maybe the roller skates

43:42.240 --> 43:47.060
aren't bronzed. Well, that's gonna create some tricky feet issues. Anyway.

43:47.060 --> 43:51.960
First and foremost, I am bothered by the limitations of the question. I don't understand why I

43:51.960 --> 43:56.320
have to wait to be dead to be bronzed.

43:56.320 --> 43:59.120
Are you talking full bronzing, or are you talking like a partial Tremaine?

43:59.120 --> 44:03.840
Well, I'm just saying, like, I feel like it would be very protective if I could just

44:03.840 --> 44:05.840
go like, toes to neck.

44:05.840 --> 44:06.840
Okay.

44:06.840 --> 44:10.480
You know, leave my head out there for all the important shit, but just go toes to neck,

44:10.480 --> 44:14.680
and so then I know I'm ba- wait, is bronze bulletproof?

44:14.680 --> 44:17.400
It depends on how thick it is.

44:17.400 --> 44:20.440
I can tell you this, though. It is poop and peep proof.

44:20.440 --> 44:25.080
Okay, I'm gonna need some outlets. I'm gonna need some outlets cut.

44:25.080 --> 44:29.880
Okay, so basically what we're talking about is like a shitty Iron Man scenario.

44:29.880 --> 44:30.880
Yes.

44:30.880 --> 44:38.080
I am Iron Ma- I'm fucking falling over! Shit, I landed on my dick outlet.

44:38.080 --> 44:41.520
Fuck! Help me! Pepper Potts, help me!

44:41.520 --> 44:45.560
I peed and pooped in my bronze suit again. Watch me shoot my beams!

44:45.560 --> 44:50.440
Oh, I don't have beams? I'm just made of steel? Fuck me.

44:50.440 --> 44:54.160
Avengers assemble! I pooped and peed in here a month ago.

44:54.160 --> 45:02.320
Master, yes, Jarvis? You smell like fucking piss on metal, and I hate it.

45:02.320 --> 45:07.360
I'm leaving. I'm an AI, and I hate it.

45:07.360 --> 45:14.360
I'm deleting myself because of how bad your pee metal smell smells.

45:14.360 --> 45:18.440
I like that Jarvis is concerned about it being bulletproof, as if anyone would ever want

45:18.440 --> 45:23.600
to shoot a robot. Jarvis, you have to worry about it being bulletproof

45:23.600 --> 45:27.800
because I'm saying a week and a half in, you're gonna be like, fucking kill me.

45:27.800 --> 45:30.800
Yeah, why would he- Okay, Jarvis, I wanna jump back.

45:30.800 --> 45:33.640
You're gonna turn yourself into a robot? No, if there's any gun-toting criminal that

45:33.640 --> 45:37.680
walks in because there's a man covered in metal, surely he's a robot.

45:37.680 --> 45:40.960
That man doesn't deserve to be mad at me because he's an idiot.

45:40.960 --> 45:45.800
I am not a robot, I am still a human being, I'm just trapped in a metal husk.

45:45.800 --> 45:51.480
And the husk that is becoming my life because of my poor pre-planning.

45:51.480 --> 45:57.400
Why would anyone want to shoot a man that has locked himself with his dick in a butthole

45:57.400 --> 46:00.840
hanging out? That was your flat!

46:00.840 --> 46:05.160
The people can look under him, he can't stop them because he can't move his arms.

46:05.160 --> 46:07.560
Please everyone stop looking at my dick and or butthole.

46:07.560 --> 46:12.160
I think they have a name for someone whose limbs are encased in metal but whose sex organs

46:12.160 --> 46:16.600
are exposed and that's a fuck prison. That's what you set yourself up for.

46:16.600 --> 46:22.240
Jarvis, can you admit to us right now that this actually sounds like your dream scenario?

46:22.240 --> 46:28.560
All that you have to do is have food fed to you and shit where you stand and it's totally,

46:28.560 --> 46:30.640
totally acceptable. I don't like that you assume that I would

46:30.640 --> 46:35.760
be bronze standing. What position are we talking?

46:35.760 --> 46:39.840
We're climbing on a chaise lounge like Cleopatra.

46:39.840 --> 46:45.880
The only person we have gotten irrationally angry at and I have not regretted is jugglers.

46:45.880 --> 46:50.040
I still feel like we were pretty much on the money with jugglers.

46:50.040 --> 46:56.480
I want to keep that feud going. But literally everything else I am sorry for

46:56.480 --> 47:00.920
any time we've judged. Now, is that your Appalachian affectation

47:00.920 --> 47:06.440
on the word juggalos? Hey man, you got a festival with a bunch of

47:06.440 --> 47:11.760
jugglers around. I would marry my first born daughter to a

47:11.760 --> 47:16.480
juggalo before I let her date a juggler. Wow.

47:16.480 --> 47:20.380
I want to leave it at that. Wow, Adam.

47:20.380 --> 47:25.640
By saying that, my future daughter is going to listen to this and date a juggler to piss

47:25.640 --> 47:27.720
me off. God damn it.

47:27.720 --> 47:31.080
Kids, right? It's like we worked so hard for you to not

47:31.080 --> 47:37.640
date anyone who suspends balls in the air. That's all I ask.

47:37.640 --> 47:43.240
That's all I ask is to stay away from wizards and prestidigitators and jugglers.

47:43.240 --> 47:47.560
I don't like anybody who does tricks. I don't think it's so wrong.

47:47.560 --> 47:50.920
Our dad was murdered at a carnival. Have we ever talked about the fact our dad

47:50.920 --> 47:53.960
was murdered at a carnival? No, I don't think so.

47:53.960 --> 48:00.800
Although I would like to throw out a special thanks to our adopted father, Clint McElroy.

48:00.800 --> 48:03.960
We adopted him. You've done such a great job raising us, but

48:03.960 --> 48:10.840
the scars of our former dad's carnival murder, unsolved carnival murder, I feel like it really

48:10.840 --> 48:12.520
informs a lot of the stuff we talk about on the show.

48:12.520 --> 48:17.620
I am amazed that we've never talked about it. Are you sure it hasn't come up?

48:17.620 --> 48:21.880
It seems like it would have come up, the fact that our dad was killed by a juggler.

48:21.880 --> 48:25.440
Marvin, please give us a Yahoo question. Sure.

48:25.440 --> 48:28.520
This Yahoo question is sent in by Michael Lee. Thank you, Michael.

48:28.520 --> 48:31.700
It's by Yahoo Answers User Question Mark. Somebody explain what that meant.

48:31.700 --> 48:36.120
I think it's like the person deleted their account, which I love that Yahoo Answers treasures

48:36.120 --> 48:42.000
their questions so much that they don't just delete the questions, too.

48:42.000 --> 48:49.880
Question Mark asks, how do I unpotty train myself?

48:49.880 --> 48:56.080
I am a teen baby and really want to know how to unpotty train myself night and day so I

48:56.080 --> 49:01.960
can be more like a baby again. It sounds like this guy is looking for a better

49:01.960 --> 49:07.800
answer than just poop and pee in your pants instead of in the toilet like a big boy does,

49:07.800 --> 49:13.960
like you did on your big boy birthday. I don't know what to tell him.

49:13.960 --> 49:20.040
Clean your toilet and put scorpions in. That is an option to you.

49:20.040 --> 49:25.840
When you're about to use the toilet, don't. Okay, Josh, you think of it small.

49:25.840 --> 49:30.360
Let's go back to the scorpions for a second. Can you remove the toilet from your house?

49:30.360 --> 49:34.800
Or better yet, can you have a friend do it when you least expect it?

49:34.800 --> 49:40.880
Oh, this? This is the bye-bye hole. There used to be a toilet here.

49:40.880 --> 49:44.800
Now I just put things in it I never want to see again.

49:44.800 --> 49:51.560
Like all of my friendships and my dignity. Hey, Justin and Travis, can you explain to

49:51.560 --> 49:57.240
me what a teen baby is? Apparently it is not a baby sired by a teen,

49:57.240 --> 50:06.480
which is what I prayed to Jesus it did mean. So some people have chosen to live their lives,

50:06.480 --> 50:11.320
and I'm trying to be very diplomatic here, because I'm sure there are people who listen

50:11.320 --> 50:17.360
to this show who are adult babies. But some people have chosen to live their

50:17.360 --> 50:26.440
lives as babies, because that's what makes them happy to live as babies.

50:26.440 --> 50:30.840
I mean, nice work. If you can get it, I'd like to be a baby too.

50:30.840 --> 50:35.600
Like I think we'd all like to figure out how to put this particular genie back in the

50:35.600 --> 50:40.800
bottle. And I do mean bottle.

50:40.800 --> 50:44.120
If I may, even then. You may.

50:44.120 --> 50:48.720
Adult baby, I get that. Adults, tons of responsibility. It fucking sucks, and you want to be a baby

50:48.720 --> 50:52.920
and just be taken care of. I get it. Teen baby, what's your life really like

50:52.920 --> 50:55.000
that's so hard? No, Travis.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.880
As a teenager that you're like, if only I could regress eight years.

50:58.880 --> 51:04.560
Think back to high school. Middle school especially, but high school to some extent, the worst

51:04.560 --> 51:08.040
part of your entire life. The absolute worst part. I feel like the reason

51:08.040 --> 51:13.360
that not all teenagers are teen babies is because they don't know that that's an option.

51:13.360 --> 51:18.360
And honestly, I would say that if you are charismatic enough, you could probably pull

51:18.360 --> 51:21.080
off teen baby and be one of the most popular kids in school.

51:21.080 --> 51:24.760
Travis. He would be like, ah, big baby, what's up?

51:24.760 --> 51:28.520
I think you're thinking of teen wolf. Yeah, teen wolf couldn't pull that-

51:28.520 --> 51:33.260
You're right, you guys. Sorry. Oh, could you tell your new school that you're a werewolf?

51:33.260 --> 51:36.160
They would want to see some- They're going to need to see hard proof.

51:36.160 --> 51:38.360
Yeah, they're going to need to see the long form.

51:38.360 --> 51:43.480
Tell them it's too dangerous. Now the commitment is two days out of every month, you can't

51:43.480 --> 51:47.120
go to school. You don't want to see me. I get super Randy

51:47.120 --> 51:51.320
and I'm real good at basketball, and I surf on top of my friend's van. It's too dangerous.

51:51.320 --> 51:56.320
You don't want to see this. I have a coworker who has a language issue.

51:56.320 --> 52:05.440
He seems to think the phrase- Okay, okay. He seems-

52:05.440 --> 52:11.880
God, you are 14 years old. Okay, I can do this. I can do this. He seems

52:11.880 --> 52:18.640
to think the phrase blow my load means the same as the phrase blow my top. He uses it

52:18.640 --> 52:24.920
frequently to describe when he feels angry. Needless to say, I'll find this hilarious,

52:24.920 --> 52:29.920
but I don't want him to hurt his career using this phrase. Should I ruin this beautiful

52:29.920 --> 52:34.740
situation by telling him or keep it a secret until he gets old? That's from Amused in

52:34.740 --> 52:41.000
New Orleans. Is it possible that your coworker just finds

52:41.000 --> 52:46.640
really random shit erotic? I swear to God, if the boss tells me to finish

52:46.640 --> 52:51.080
our report sooner one more time, I'm going to blow my load.

52:51.080 --> 52:57.280
He just kind of wants the printer to act up. He kind of just wants to forget his lunch

52:57.280 --> 52:59.880
at home. If you don't get back in here and make a

52:59.880 --> 53:06.760
pot of coffee after you finish it, I'm going to blow my load all over the place.

53:06.760 --> 53:12.360
I don't have anybody like this in my life. You understand that this person is a unicorn

53:12.360 --> 53:18.280
and this thing doesn't really happen. It only happens in American Pie movies. Why the fuck

53:18.280 --> 53:23.120
would you ruin it by telling them? Yeah, you are currently working with a mid-90s

53:23.120 --> 53:32.120
SNL Rob Schneider character and you need to just keep that roll rolling. Keep it going.

53:32.120 --> 53:36.400
I'm also willing to bet that if you even voice a concern about telling him, you will

53:36.400 --> 53:42.240
be swarmed by 30 different people being like, Todd, you can't tell him. This is all I've

53:42.240 --> 53:46.840
got, Todd. My family life is shit. Think about this, Amused in New Orleans. If

53:46.840 --> 53:53.600
some other crankster had come along and fixed this before you got to it, we would never

53:53.600 --> 53:57.080
have heard of it. Think about that for a second.

53:57.080 --> 53:59.880
That's true and it wouldn't have brought joy to my life. Also think about the fact

53:59.880 --> 54:05.200
that if you talk to this guy, that's going to be in the Guinness Book of World Records

54:05.200 --> 54:11.040
for the shittiest conversation ever because it's going to go, hey, Todd, that thing you've

54:11.040 --> 54:17.520
been saying, it means coming and then he's going to fall to his knees and he's going

54:17.520 --> 54:22.600
to lash himself. Here's the thing. If you tell him, if you're

54:22.600 --> 54:29.680
the guy who tells him, you are immediately responsible for every single time he has said

54:29.680 --> 54:33.800
that and you have not corrected him. Oh, great point, Justin, because he's going

54:33.800 --> 54:39.160
to sit there and think, well, I said it to you when the boss's niece was around and

54:39.160 --> 54:43.560
you didn't say shit. You just let me keep saying it. What's the matter with you?

54:43.560 --> 54:48.640
Oh, hey, by the way, it means coming. It does mean coming, sir.

54:48.640 --> 54:51.560
If everybody doesn't know. Yeah.

54:51.560 --> 55:06.440
Why is Garfield so funny, but not in any way that his creator can harness? Why is everyone

55:06.440 --> 55:13.320
else able to make Garfield funny, but somehow the ability to elude it escapes Jim Davis

55:13.320 --> 55:22.440
daily, seven times a day. This motherfucker can't get the funniest strip correct. He is

55:22.440 --> 55:26.800
unable to see what he has made and use it for good.

55:26.800 --> 55:29.880
It's one of those things where Garfield minus Garfield is like some of the funniest shit

55:29.880 --> 55:35.160
around, but if he had just drawn that strip, it would have been fucking mind-blowingly

55:35.160 --> 55:37.680
terrible. Ultimately, the comedy that we find in it

55:37.680 --> 55:44.800
is a direct result of Jim Davis's impotence. His inability. Right, exactly. If he were

55:44.800 --> 55:51.280
more competent as an artist or creator, then we wouldn't be, but see like, okay, you look

55:51.280 --> 55:55.980
at Garfield minus Garfield or really any sort of deconstructionist Garfield rap that we

55:55.980 --> 56:04.680
have done. If Jim Davis had the artistic ability to kill his little darlings, to have the foresight,

56:04.680 --> 56:10.080
that scalpel, that artistic scalpel to cut away the inessentials of his comedy, he could

56:10.080 --> 56:16.520
be one of the great ones, excuse me, Bill Watterson. He could be the greatest comic

56:16.520 --> 56:21.960
artist of all time, but he is unable. He cannot see beyond his mediocrity.

56:21.960 --> 56:26.680
In a way though, isn't that his legacy? This is what I'm saying it's intentional. I'm

56:26.680 --> 56:31.280
saying that Garfield, people wouldn't be talking, Garfield wouldn't be as relevant as it is

56:31.280 --> 56:36.640
today, which is to say incredibly relevant. If it was just like, if it was the funniest

56:36.640 --> 56:43.520
thing ever, if it was Mad TV, you know? Wait, excuse me? That's a whole different rabbit

56:43.520 --> 56:48.600
hole. I don't want to go down right now. If it was the funniest thing ever, a la Mad

56:48.600 --> 56:52.520
TV, then people wouldn't be talking about it because there would be nothing to say except

56:52.520 --> 56:56.320
did you see the latest Garfield? And people would say yes and say, I laughed so hard that

56:56.320 --> 57:01.920
I forgot to feed my kids. I would hate to be the weird magician that

57:01.920 --> 57:10.640
came up with the frosty stuff and then try to explain to people why. I don't know what

57:10.640 --> 57:15.760
good excuse- like first off, you have to open and like the first line of your explanation

57:15.760 --> 57:22.000
has to be, well, not for sex. Listen, I want to be clear on one thing.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.480
This should be self-evident. This thing's made out of snow and coal. There is, there

57:26.480 --> 57:29.400
is no- It's not a weird sex thing.

57:29.400 --> 57:33.720
I was lonely. And was I open-minded? Yes, I was.

57:33.720 --> 57:35.800
What he has to really explain- Friendship? Maybe.

57:35.800 --> 57:43.760
What he has to explain away is why make this sentient living thing with the heart and soul

57:43.760 --> 57:51.280
of a kind human being out of the most like fleeting substance that there is.

57:51.280 --> 57:57.960
I made this hat that you put on a fart and it turns into a person. Oh, what was I thinking?

57:57.960 --> 58:05.720
My first shot at this was frosty, the sort of homunculus I made out of wet sand right

58:05.720 --> 58:12.360
on the edge of the beach right at about like 430, right before high tide came in.

58:12.360 --> 58:18.280
Have you ever noticed how from 10am to 4pm every single day you just hear a creature

58:18.280 --> 58:23.240
screaming a sandy, sandy scream in terror? That's my bad.

58:23.240 --> 58:28.720
But I'm gonna get it right. Mark my words. Just move him off the beach, you say? That's

58:28.720 --> 58:31.520
not a bad idea. But then the pelicans can get at him.

58:31.520 --> 58:33.120
I'll workshop it, but- Or at least a week.

58:33.120 --> 58:37.280
But is it even sadder if you think about- He puts this hat on, he knows like nothing.

58:37.280 --> 58:42.480
It's his birthday, you know? By the way, a top hat, not even a sun hat

58:42.480 --> 58:46.840
to protect him from the rays. No brim whatsoever. And he's just this happy

58:46.840 --> 58:51.280
go lucky young man, and yet for some reason there's two things he knows. He knows how

58:51.280 --> 58:56.360
to love, and that he will soon be dead. He's learning everything else on his own,

58:56.360 --> 59:01.480
and yet there is one inherent piece of information in his head. Oh, by the way, if it heats up

59:01.480 --> 59:06.900
above say about 32, I'm out of here. So you're basically saying he's the epitome

59:06.900 --> 59:11.620
of Tim McGraw's live like you were dying. Yes. He was specifically created to know only

59:11.620 --> 59:18.320
one thing, and that he didn't have long to go. Live like you were melting.

59:18.320 --> 59:24.080
I told some kids in the neighborhood about how I was gonna die.

59:24.080 --> 59:32.720
I tried to go skydiving, but I just kind of fell apart because I made of snow. If a parachute

59:32.720 --> 59:36.280
whipped me back, it would probably rip me in half.

59:36.280 --> 59:44.040
Please don't throw my chest bones at a kid. Frosty doesn't have bones, I don't think.

59:44.040 --> 59:47.960
I think he was saying his bones are made of snow, and then you turn those into snowballs,

59:47.960 --> 59:52.400
and then you hit somebody with it. Right. How is he ambulatory if inside his

59:52.400 --> 59:58.720
snow flesh is not a nice skeleton? I assume it was like various sacks of water

59:58.720 --> 01:00:03.080
and air. It's like squishing and refilling.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.880
Much like an octopus or something along those lines.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.360
Did you go see Frosty? Yeah, I tried to stand next to him, and the sound of his body moving.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:18.360
What if he had nothing to do with magic? It was just like, it was genetics. So I genetically

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.240
made a half that when you put it on, like that was the only response system.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:28.000
This is gonna sound weird, but could you put your mouth on my armpit and blow? My air sac

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.480
seems to have deflated. I want to wave goodbye to you kids. Of course, it's too late.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:38.800
Watch out for my venomous prongs. I have all of those to keep the dogs away.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:44.920
Oh, the traffic cop hollered stop, so I inked all over him. Goodbye.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:50.680
I'm nature's greatest monster. I want to tell you about our last advertiser,

01:00:50.680 --> 01:01:00.880
ExtremeRestraints.com. It is a diverse retailer with a variety of

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:07.440
goods that seem to have no discernible theme. It's a general store then, you would say.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:14.040
It's something of a general store. Here's an attachment you can put on a drill that

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:23.360
it seems to be a soft rubber tip, perhaps to protect you from drilling things accidentally.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:28.120
What happens? Are you jamming a drill and then you turn it on and then you say, whoops,

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:33.600
that's not... I didn't mean to drill this chair. How did you get into this predicament

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.600
in the first place? You trip. You get excited because you're about

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:41.920
to drill something. So you start drilling and then you fall or trip.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.720
I'm looking at one thing here and it looks like... Have you ever like been carrying a

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:49.280
candle around? I thought like, ah, this takes up a whole hand and I need two hands to do

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.680
some things. It looks like here they have a belt that you can wear that you can hold

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:59.560
the candle on the belt and then you have two free hands. I think that's pretty impressive.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:05.560
I think I understand. You know how sometimes you're at home and you just got back from

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:09.640
the grocery store and you get out the kielbases that you bought at the grocery store and you

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:15.400
think, man, these sure looked bigger at the grocery store. And then you get them out and

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.800
you find them unsatisfyingly small and you think, these aren't going to keep me... These

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:25.800
aren't going to fill me up. They have a special... I'll call it a peripheral and it is a pump

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:31.160
and you put the kielbasa inside it and if you... And then all of a sudden your kielbasa,

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.000
the kielbasa that you bought for eating is bigger.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.640
Have you ever said something you didn't mean to someone and you think, ah, me and my big

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:46.920
mouth. When am I going to learn to keep my big mouth shut? Well, what if you could put

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:51.920
a ball in there all the time that you can't take out at all. Maybe a big... Maybe you

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:57.040
put a whole leather mask in front of your face that looks like a dog and you never see

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.040
anything.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.760
And it's very funny because, you know, it's a great gag gift because everyone's always

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:08.520
walking dogs, but nobody ever puts the leash on a person. You know what else makes it a

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:20.960
great gag gift? A gag. Can this be the rest of the episode, please? Have you ever been

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:26.440
at home and it's real hot so obviously you're not wearing any pants or underpants and so

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:31.560
you're sitting there and I don't want to get blue, but let's say your privates are out,

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:36.160
but all of a sudden there's a bunch of wild dogs get in the room and you're afraid that

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:41.760
you'll be bitten on your privates. Well, there's a special cage that you can put around it

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.560
to keep wild animals away from the thing that you have down there, whatever it may be, but

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.560
I think I know what it is.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.640
Extreme Strains is looking out for your safety.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:55.040
It's a safety cage like a shark, which shark divers use.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:01.440
You know how sometimes when you turn into a werewolf, people chain you up in the basement?

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:10.880
Well, what if only your privates turn into a werewolf? Have you thought about that underserved

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.880
portion of the population?

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:16.040
What if you're the captain of a pirate ship?

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:21.880
Okay, go on. I'm following so far.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:30.720
You need something with which to punish the shipmates who act up and really, you can't

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.000
go to Target and buy a cat of nine tails, you know what I mean?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.200
Sure, yeah, go on.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.160
This is a whip specifically for non-sexual punishment.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:45.360
I can't stress this enough. Imagine this, you're trying to get to work, right, but you're

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.480
late and you need to take the carpool lane, but you're by yourself and you've got no one

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:53.480
to carpool with you. Then you're reaching the trunk and you inflate yourself a friend

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.520
and you pop them into your passenger seat.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.420
Carpool buddy, that's the extremestrains.com. Have you ever looked at really skee cucumber

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:07.440
and thought, I bet I could juice that.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:12.680
Extremestrains.com has got you covered with a head honcho.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:19.720
Man, chronic constipation is a problem that a lot of people run to nowadays. Maybe you

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:23.320
don't want to go to the ballgreens and buy a douche, and maybe you want to buy a special

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.200
douche, one that can get real deep in there.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:30.400
You know, chronic diarrhea is a problem. Wouldn't it be easier to just plug it up?

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.400
Nothing, nothing.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:36.080
It's not you covered in Extreme Restrains. Nothing coming out of the one.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.080
Oh my god.

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:42.600
You know, swings are great for the kids. What about adults?

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:47.360
But don't you miss the fun of soaring through the air and out of care in the world? Well,

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:51.080
Extreme Restrains has you covered with a fun swing to swing on.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.080
Sure.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:55.400
Griff, did you have another question, one last one to send us off on?

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.800
Yeah, I could. I could do that for you.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:03.640
It was sent in by Nolan Hitchcock. Thank you, Nolan. It's by Yahoo Answers user, Jessica,

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:10.560
who asks, is it bad to give my six-year-old baby a little French onion dip?

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:13.080
Oh, Justin McElroy.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.120
