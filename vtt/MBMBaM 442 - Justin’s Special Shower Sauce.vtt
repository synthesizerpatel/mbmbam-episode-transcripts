00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.400
Hello, everyone, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother Made Advice Show for the modern era.

00:48.400 --> 00:53.040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Let me check my notes here. Oh, yep,

00:53.040 --> 00:58.880
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. And I guess that just leaves the baby brother,

00:58.880 --> 01:02.160
Griffin McElroy, for me. Is that the one you're gonna be?

01:02.160 --> 01:04.960
That's who I'm gonna be this time. I wanna be that character.

01:04.960 --> 01:09.040
Yeah, I hear he's the blonde one that drives all the babes wild.

01:09.040 --> 01:13.600
He drives the babes wild, he's got better stats, and he can fly, so.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.920
But he has one weakness, chocolate.

01:19.360 --> 01:23.200
Hey, what's the intro this time, though? Glass watch.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.480
Glass watch. We're gonna watch glass, I guess.

01:26.480 --> 01:30.640
We're gonna make and watch glass. We're gonna blow glass.

01:31.600 --> 01:37.520
Mr. Shyamalan is back with his bold vision. His Marvel Cinematic Universe.

01:37.520 --> 01:45.120
His Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is, I have to give Mr. Shyamalan credit for continuing

01:45.120 --> 01:52.960
with this project because my man did Unbreakable back in the Halcyon days.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.960
Yes. 2000. Follow that up.

01:56.960 --> 02:05.360
Just took a brief break of 16 years and said, hey, I got another one,

02:05.360 --> 02:09.600
but it's a secret, and I'm not gonna tell you it's one of mine, one of this kind.

02:11.360 --> 02:16.320
That's the best way to promote any movie, by not telling people that it might be

02:16.320 --> 02:20.560
related to a movie that they actually did like back in the past.

02:20.560 --> 02:25.840
Yeah, so this one's got Unbreakable Guy, which was his formal name.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.560
Mr. Glass, of course. Samuel L. Jackson's turn.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.000
It has the nasty man from the movie.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.600
Yeah, Angry McAvoy.

02:33.600 --> 02:37.120
Angry McAvoy, the nasty man from the movie that very few people watched,

02:37.120 --> 02:40.000
so he's gonna be cool. It'd be like if they did Avengers,

02:40.000 --> 02:43.120
and one of the Avengers was Electra.

02:43.840 --> 02:47.200
And I'm also reading here that Superman is in this one.

02:47.200 --> 02:51.280
Superman's in this one. They have village monsters in this one.

02:51.280 --> 02:54.400
They got Paul Giamatti from Lady in the Water in this one.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.360
People are stoked out of their fucking minds about that.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.000
Wait, was that him? No, that was Robert Rodriguez, wasn't it?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Yeah, it was a different person altogether.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.000
Bryce Dallas Howard in two roles is very exciting.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.320
We're excited to see what she brings to the table.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.160
The water aliens are in this one.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.480
Yeah, water aliens in it.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.640
Asmatic Boy from Signs is in it.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.760
I'm very excited to see how he fights all the monsters,

03:19.760 --> 03:24.400
and I hear him and Nasty Man have a big tussle, so psych for that.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.520
The ninja in the water.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.760
The ninja in the water's back.

03:29.120 --> 03:35.120
The Avatar, both The Last Airbender and The Navi, they're all in it.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.320
I was looking up the dates of these flicks on Wikipedia,

03:38.320 --> 03:41.520
and looking at the names of the films altogether,

03:42.160 --> 03:46.160
it sounds like you're returning a faulty product.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.720
Unbreakable split glass, huh?

03:48.720 --> 03:49.920
Oh, no.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.440
Guess it ain't so, huh?

03:51.440 --> 03:53.680
Because it's split glass, it's supposed to be unbreakable.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.680
I would like a full refund.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.800
Now, the character I'm worried is going to be a little overpowered

03:58.800 --> 04:01.600
in this new superhero team is The Happening.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.400
Because The Happening is just a thing in the wind

04:04.400 --> 04:09.120
that makes people just go wild and do bad stuff,

04:09.120 --> 04:10.720
and it's sort of just wind.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.120
So I don't even know how they show that shit on a poster,

04:13.120 --> 04:17.360
but I'm excited, this movie's going to be so fucking badass.

04:17.360 --> 04:22.000
Do you guys ever think about the fact that M. Night Shyamalan

04:22.000 --> 04:24.720
made, I would say, some bangers early on,

04:24.720 --> 04:30.320
but then was also responsible for The Last Airbender after Earth?

04:30.320 --> 04:30.960
Yeah.

04:30.960 --> 04:36.000
The Happening, like some major, I would say, El Zilchos.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.600
I'm glad someone has those fucking guts.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.640
Yeah, finally, someone's putting that guy in his fucking place

04:40.640 --> 04:42.720
while reflecting on his former successes.

04:42.720 --> 04:47.600
Truth to Shyamalan, he obviously, much like Mr. Glass,

04:47.600 --> 04:51.440
has greatness within him, and he just needed the right people

04:51.440 --> 04:54.000
around him to help bring it out.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.200
And those people are not Mark Wahlberg, apparently.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.040
Apparently Mark Wahlberg brings out the worst.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.720
He brings out some bad stuff, y'all.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.080
I and my lemon drink.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.400
Hey, fellas, let me ask you this, though.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.640
Do you think, post-credits, I heard a rumor,

05:06.640 --> 05:07.760
the elevator's in it.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.520
Remember he made a elevator movie,

05:11.520 --> 05:13.360
and that was kind of the last one where he's like,

05:13.360 --> 05:15.360
let me just get in there and make a elevator movie.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.680
And we were like, I think it's done, bud.

05:19.120 --> 05:19.520
So excited.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.680
Do you guys think there'll be a twist in this one?

05:21.680 --> 05:22.720
I just-

05:22.720 --> 05:23.920
Some kind of twist?

05:24.720 --> 05:26.640
Were you expecting it to be different,

05:26.640 --> 05:28.320
but then it's something else?

05:28.320 --> 05:31.600
I want to warn you all, if I see Freddie Prinze Jr.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.560
and Rachel Lee Cook show up, I'm going to lose my damn mind.

05:34.560 --> 05:34.800
Wait, what?

05:34.800 --> 05:36.720
If we're bringing back, well, She's All That,

05:36.720 --> 05:38.480
you know, the hit film She's All That

05:38.480 --> 05:40.480
that was written by M. Night Shyamalan.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.040
What?

05:41.040 --> 05:43.760
If they show up with Stuart Little on their shoulder,

05:43.760 --> 05:45.520
I'm going to lose my damn mind.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.280
Did he write those films?

05:47.280 --> 05:48.400
Hell yeah, he did.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.240
I thought you were a Shyamalan maniac.

05:52.240 --> 05:58.320
I didn't expect his career to have a Shyamalan twist in it.

05:58.320 --> 05:59.920
His career has one.

05:59.920 --> 06:04.960
This year, in the year of our Lord, 1999,

06:04.960 --> 06:09.120
he did The Sixth Sense, he wrote She's All That,

06:09.120 --> 06:12.800
he wrote Stuart Little, and then Hollywood was like,

06:12.800 --> 06:16.960
good year, good year, please have the next 20 years on us.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.840
So I'm going to be in this theater fucking open,

06:21.840 --> 06:23.520
if they do midnight showing, I'm in here,

06:23.520 --> 06:25.200
I've got to know, I've got to know.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.560
Midnight Shyamalan?

06:26.560 --> 06:27.760
I must fucking know.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.440
Is that what the M stands for?

06:29.440 --> 06:32.080
Absolutely, Midnight Shyamalan.

06:32.080 --> 06:36.400
My name is Midnight Shyamalan, the M is for mid?

06:36.400 --> 06:42.240
So do we, I'm done talking about,

06:42.240 --> 06:44.560
I feel like we were mean, and now we just go on.

06:44.560 --> 06:45.600
This is the end of it.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.720
This is the last film in the trilogy.

06:49.760 --> 06:50.320
Sure.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.640
The trilogy of films, this is the third one,

06:52.640 --> 06:55.840
and I was sad to hear that it's a trilogy,

06:55.840 --> 06:59.600
but then I got happy again, because Wikipedia says,

06:59.600 --> 07:03.200
that he said that he's open to making another one

07:03.200 --> 07:04.800
if he gets a good idea.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.560
Fuck yes.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.360
I guess he has become seasoned with age,

07:09.360 --> 07:12.160
and will wait to make a movie until he does have a good idea,

07:12.160 --> 07:13.920
which I think is good and inspiring.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.240
Season with age is a good way,

07:16.240 --> 07:19.200
his career is kind of like that old cast iron pan

07:19.200 --> 07:20.080
that you got in your drawer,

07:20.080 --> 07:21.280
and you're not supposed to wash it,

07:21.280 --> 07:23.120
but it's got a little bit of happening in it,

07:23.120 --> 07:26.000
but it still has that sixth sense spice in it.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.880
But you had to let the happening burn in it a little bit.

07:28.880 --> 07:29.360
A little bit.

07:29.360 --> 07:32.720
To get that crust, to get that village crust on it.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.800
So I'm wondering if Freddy Rodriguez

07:34.800 --> 07:37.280
and his one big strong arm from Lady in the Water

07:37.280 --> 07:38.160
is going to be in it.

07:38.960 --> 07:39.840
Just the arm.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.600
Just the arm, his one big strong arm.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.800
Hey, let's do some questions.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.200
I'm sorry, I thought we were going to talk about

07:46.000 --> 07:47.440
M. Night Shyamalan.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.040
Were you Googling some more?

07:49.040 --> 07:52.080
Oh, sorry, were you loading up the canon juice?

07:52.080 --> 07:55.600
Just a little of the canon for the great M. Night Shyamalan.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.800
Well, go ahead and blast that shit.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.320
I don't want you to get us stuff in canon, go ahead.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.480
I like more of his films that I don't like,

08:00.480 --> 08:02.240
and I feel like that might be good.

08:02.240 --> 08:05.280
I feel like that might have gotten lost in translation.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.640
He's taken a big swing.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.720
He wrote lost in translation?

08:08.720 --> 08:09.440
Come on now.

08:09.440 --> 08:10.000
Come on now.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.760
I know that even he would look at the happening and say,

08:13.760 --> 08:14.800
this one I duked.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.400
On this one is dooky.

08:19.120 --> 08:21.600
This one is a dooky for me.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.840
There's a W column, there's an L column.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.240
There's no shame in ending up in either one of those columns.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.040
But there is another column to the right of the L column

08:29.040 --> 08:30.080
that is the D column.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.680
This for films you dookied.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.680
And listen, we've dookied a few episodes.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.640
I hear it.

08:34.640 --> 08:38.240
But I think even M. Night Shyamalan would say,

08:38.800 --> 08:42.320
I dookied the happening, the lemon drink thing,

08:42.320 --> 08:44.640
the whole, actually all the bits.

08:44.640 --> 08:48.480
Watching Spencer Breslin get absolutely fucking bodied

08:48.480 --> 08:50.480
with a shotgun in the fucking face.

08:53.760 --> 08:54.800
Oh no.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.040
That picture, that picture though.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.920
So hey, what's up next?

08:59.920 --> 09:00.880
Oh boy.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.720
Sorry, just really good.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.520
My dad is a proficient woodworker.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.040
He's retired.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.040
So he spends a lot of time in his workshop,

09:09.040 --> 09:10.960
but he rarely builds things for himself.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.200
He's a very generous man and loves,

09:13.200 --> 09:16.320
is this your dad's grinder page or like a question?

09:16.320 --> 09:19.280
Okay, he loves building things as gifts for people.

09:20.080 --> 09:23.120
However, he sometimes goes overboard and builds things

09:23.120 --> 09:24.720
for people he barely knows.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.400
For example, he recently told me he built a jewelry box

09:28.400 --> 09:30.640
for a waitress at a local diner.

09:30.640 --> 09:33.520
Then he made the waitress's boyfriend a cutting board

09:33.520 --> 09:35.760
so he wouldn't get the wrong idea.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.120
Yowza.

09:37.120 --> 09:40.480
Yay, yay, yay, yay.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.320
How do I tell my dad that this is weird?

09:43.280 --> 09:45.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:45.120 --> 09:48.880
Okay, wait, on the one hand, it is weird.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.080
But on the other hand, free jewelry box and cutting board.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.760
Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.560
Yeah, I mean, you can't argue with that, Trav.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.640
Free stuff is free stuff is free stuff.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.160
And we love it in this country.

10:01.120 --> 10:04.160
The giving a jewelry box to a person you don't know

10:04.160 --> 10:04.880
is the strain.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.160
A cutting board is great because a cutting board,

10:08.160 --> 10:10.320
I get that from a woodworker and I say,

10:10.320 --> 10:13.040
this is handy for me and you did not work very hard on it

10:13.040 --> 10:15.440
because it is just wood.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.320
Thank you, Dennis.

10:16.320 --> 10:17.440
It's a board, Dennis.

10:17.440 --> 10:18.800
Thank you so much.

10:18.800 --> 10:22.080
I see that you've sort of carved in very crudely

10:22.080 --> 10:25.680
Griffin's chopping zone, and that's fun and I like it.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.240
That is going to get food in it, though,

10:28.240 --> 10:29.040
and that's a problem.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.680
It's gonna be gross, but I appreciate this.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.360
Took you three minutes to make,

10:33.360 --> 10:36.320
and that's about how I value our friendship, too,

10:36.320 --> 10:39.280
because I do not know you except for when you come

10:39.280 --> 10:42.320
to this TGI Fridays, thank you so much.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.920
The cheese balls will be here very soon.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.840
I would say, though, you can't say giving a present

10:47.840 --> 10:51.120
to someone you don't know is bad because Santa Claus.

10:51.120 --> 10:51.840
Santa Claus.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.000
Yep, that's true, Trav.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.800
Santa Claus gets me stuff sometimes and I think,

10:56.800 --> 10:58.800
is this dude in love with me or what?

11:00.720 --> 11:02.720
Like, he gets me a fancy watch and I'm like,

11:03.440 --> 11:05.520
is this dude in love with me?

11:05.520 --> 11:07.360
Because I don't know him from Adam.

11:07.360 --> 11:08.960
You gave him a list, though, Griff.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.160
You give him a list every year

11:10.160 --> 11:13.520
in that sweet little stationery or cinema list.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.680
That's just asking for things that you get.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.120
That's not the same thing.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.240
I just don't.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.320
Sometimes he gives me stuff not on the list

11:20.320 --> 11:23.200
and sometimes it's like, you know,

11:23.200 --> 11:27.280
one time he got me undergarments from the undies

11:27.280 --> 11:29.440
and I'm like, Santa Claus, that's a little,

11:29.440 --> 11:31.200
do you want to see me in these, bud?

11:32.960 --> 11:33.840
I'm not saying no.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.840
It's just like, I don't know you.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.920
Oh, I have a great solution question, Aster.

11:40.560 --> 11:43.200
Set your dad up with an Etsy shop

11:43.200 --> 11:44.880
and say something like,

11:44.880 --> 11:47.120
Dad, you're giving all this stuff away for free.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.680
Let me set you up.

11:49.680 --> 11:50.960
I'll post the pictures.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.200
I'll take care of this for you.

11:54.400 --> 11:58.800
And like that way, if your dad wants to give stuff out,

11:58.800 --> 12:01.360
he still could, but he can include like a business card

12:01.360 --> 12:02.720
with a link to a shop and say,

12:02.720 --> 12:04.720
and tell your friends about this.

12:04.720 --> 12:05.280
That's good.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.640
And that way it's not as weirdly personal.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.840
I can sympathize with this because I love to bake.

12:12.560 --> 12:15.840
A lot of times I find myself baking a whole tray of things.

12:15.840 --> 12:19.040
Nobody bakes, you know, three cookies.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.960
You got to bake a pan of them.

12:20.960 --> 12:24.480
And I don't know who to give them to.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.000
So they end up maybe going to waste

12:26.000 --> 12:29.760
or eventually we take them to the other people at the hospital

12:29.760 --> 12:31.040
or city works out or whatever.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.840
But on the flip side of that,

12:33.840 --> 12:37.920
I often find myself wishing that I had something.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.080
It doesn't matter what.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.680
It could be anything.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.160
Maybe I want some food.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.960
I wish someone would make me some food, I think to myself,

12:46.960 --> 12:48.560
but there's nowhere to turn.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.600
Well, hold on.

12:50.480 --> 12:51.840
I just clicked to the next slide.

12:51.840 --> 12:55.440
Well, I'm so glad that you joined me here for this.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.360
Has this ever happened to you sharks?

12:57.360 --> 13:01.680
Well, I'm happy to announce my new app Freebie.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.760
And there's eight E's in there.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.520
So just it's trademarkable.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.160
No problem.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.120
Freebie is a social network

13:09.120 --> 13:11.840
where you can put in something that you want to make

13:12.480 --> 13:15.520
and then other people put in things that they want

13:15.520 --> 13:16.880
and then the app connects you.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.880
And then you just make the things

13:18.880 --> 13:20.000
and they don't go to waste

13:20.000 --> 13:22.400
and people get the things that they need and want.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.040
Every time this transaction occurs,

13:25.040 --> 13:27.120
they both pay me $17.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.720
I got to say it's exciting

13:30.720 --> 13:33.120
and I see where the revenue stream is going to come from.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.760
Thank you talking shark.

13:36.640 --> 13:40.240
Me, I do say, I got to say this.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.280
I already invest in an app called Freebies

13:43.280 --> 13:46.640
and it's where they give away all the bees that they eat.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.680
It's where you can get bees on sort of gratis.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.240
So I'm out.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.000
Shark Cuban here.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.400
I already have invested in a website called Free the Bees,

14:04.400 --> 14:06.560
which is all about getting the bees out of prison.

14:07.520 --> 14:08.560
So far, so good.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.880
As far as I know, there aren't any bees in prison.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.000
So it's going well.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.120
It was a good investment, I think.

14:17.120 --> 14:20.080
But this brings me to, I am a fan of bees.

14:20.800 --> 14:24.320
I did kind of zone out for most of your presentation.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.240
I assume it does include bees.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.200
So you've stopped talking.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.440
Are there bees?

14:31.440 --> 14:34.960
Which says to me, your comedy partner, Justin McElroy,

14:34.960 --> 14:36.640
that you didn't listen to what I said

14:36.640 --> 14:38.000
closely enough to build on it,

14:38.000 --> 14:39.440
but you do want me to,

14:39.440 --> 14:42.480
you've put, I drove over to your house with a hot joke.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.440
And then you said, screwed over.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.280
And then you drove me back to my house

14:47.280 --> 14:51.760
with that same now cooled stale joke.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.000
I did say the thing about Shark Cuban.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.520
I don't know how much more you want, Frank.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.440
You want me to make two jokes?

15:01.440 --> 15:05.280
Travis has, there's yes and no, but,

15:05.280 --> 15:07.520
and Travis had one, this also.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.360
Yeah, my thing now.

15:09.360 --> 15:13.040
And a fourth one, this instead is good also.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.480
How about a yahoo?

15:14.480 --> 15:15.200
I got a yahoo.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.520
Here's one from Lawrence Evelyn.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.240
Thank you, Lawrence.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.560
It's yahoo answers user, Billy, who asks,

15:23.360 --> 15:27.200
is it time to force dogs to wear underwear?

15:28.960 --> 15:31.360
I think I'll puke if I have to see one.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.320
I haven't even gotten to the good stuff.

15:34.320 --> 15:37.360
I don't know why that phrase, I think I'll puke.

15:37.360 --> 15:40.160
It sounds like you just opted for something off a menu.

15:40.160 --> 15:44.320
If I have to see one more canine anus winking back at me,

15:44.320 --> 15:47.680
don't get me started on doggy nuts or lipsticks.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.880
It's disgusting.

15:48.880 --> 15:52.480
And I'm tired of being forced to see nude dogs everywhere,

15:53.040 --> 15:55.360
should the government force dogs to dress in underwear.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.000
I have a real problem with this,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.200
that you didn't go with canis, canine anus.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.040
That's clumsy, canis.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.240
Also, I think that the three words canine anus winking

16:06.240 --> 16:09.920
is maybe the worst sort of combination

16:09.920 --> 16:12.960
that I've ever sort of experienced in all my time

16:12.960 --> 16:14.160
with the English language.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.840
But I am tired of seeing these butts and penises.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.080
And it's a double standard.

16:22.080 --> 16:26.000
And I do get it.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.440
I do get it and approve of it and endorse it

16:29.440 --> 16:31.680
and will petition it, I think.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.080
How come them, not me?

16:34.080 --> 16:37.200
Justin, where do you stand vis-a-vis dog nuts?

16:38.320 --> 16:41.120
I love the dog nuts, because that's hysterical.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.560
What's he doing with those?

16:42.560 --> 16:44.080
We've seen Van Wilder, yeah.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.920
That's great, that's great.

16:45.920 --> 16:49.280
But the butthole, are you kidding me with this thing?

16:50.320 --> 16:51.600
That close to the ground?

16:52.240 --> 16:53.920
And with those few brain cells?

16:53.920 --> 16:54.720
I don't think so.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.600
Maybe sell crazy elsewhere,

16:57.600 --> 16:59.760
because we're all full up here, Mr. Dog.

16:59.760 --> 17:04.560
Mm-hmm, maybe some kind of eye patch situation.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.080
Oh, that could be good.

17:06.080 --> 17:08.000
Yeah, you could get it right on the canus,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.080
but leave the funny dog nuts out.

17:10.080 --> 17:12.720
Yeah, I'd love to cover that lipstick up, though,

17:12.720 --> 17:14.560
if we could find a way to cover the lipstick.

17:15.520 --> 17:18.720
The nuts are so objectively funny.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.960
It's like truck nuts, but on my best friend, whiskey dog.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.600
Especially, you get them on a bulldog.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.880
Oh, that's funny.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.480
So good, but we gotta cover that dick up, though.

17:30.480 --> 17:30.980
Yuck.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.360
So maybe like a pair of glasses,

17:33.360 --> 17:35.840
where the dog nuts go in the nose part.

17:37.040 --> 17:40.160
Kind of like a twofer thing that covers the lipstick

17:40.160 --> 17:41.120
in the canus.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.360
That's real good, that's real good.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.920
I'm gonna actually put an embargo on the word canus, Trav.

17:45.920 --> 17:46.880
You're done with that one.

17:48.240 --> 17:48.800
Sorry, bud.

17:48.800 --> 17:49.760
But yeah, that'd be fun.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.760
Make it look like a Marx brother down there.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.040
Yeah.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.400
Yeah, cover it up.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.600
Cover it up, let's do it.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.640
I think let's cover it up,

17:56.640 --> 18:01.920
but unless it needs, I mean, if it needs to, it needs to.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.040
That's what I know about dogs.

18:04.640 --> 18:08.080
So cover it up, but with some kind of ripcord

18:08.080 --> 18:10.240
that the dog can implement if it needs to.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.160
With his mouth, he needs to be able to bite a cord

18:12.160 --> 18:13.600
that exposes his butthole.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.800
Then he can become incredibly powerful

18:16.800 --> 18:19.600
and towel it like the rock when he holds a gun in the rundown.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.920
When the dog needs an extra confidence boost,

18:23.920 --> 18:26.720
he pulls the ripcord that exposes his anus,

18:26.720 --> 18:29.040
and then he knows that he's the real king of town.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.360
It is a one for one comparison

18:33.360 --> 18:37.280
with rock holding a gun and a dog exposing its anus.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.640
Now what if the rock-

18:38.640 --> 18:40.240
You're not gonna give me this mortgage?

18:40.240 --> 18:41.680
Well, hold on, check this out.

18:44.560 --> 18:47.120
What if the rock also had a ripcord he could pull

18:47.120 --> 18:48.400
that makes his bung-

18:49.120 --> 18:50.480
Griffin, you don't think he does?

18:50.480 --> 18:51.280
He's the rock.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.440
He is very, very rich and powerful person.

18:53.440 --> 18:55.840
That's what the people's eyebrow is connected to.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.360
Oh, interesting.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.040
So every time he does the people's eyebrow,

18:59.040 --> 19:03.920
his bung tears his pants, and he says this is his butthole.

19:03.920 --> 19:08.080
That's why they never did a reverse shot during WWE stuff.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.280
Travis has a great point.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.880
They didn't do that one.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.160
Yeah, you never see him from behind.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.600
You just see his big, powerful front.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.280
It's really interesting.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.720
I've never really thought about it.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.760
Boys, you're not gonna believe this.

19:17.760 --> 19:21.120
Pretty much everybody on the comments here thinks this is bad.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.760
Thinks it's a bad idea and that animals should be allowed to be nude

19:23.760 --> 19:25.520
and that this is all human hangups.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.120
But aren't we humans just animals?

19:29.120 --> 19:31.040
I mean, a bung's a bung's a bung.

19:31.840 --> 19:32.960
I've always said that.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.360
And I'm sorry, do a bunch of Yahoo!

19:35.360 --> 19:38.880
Answers people suddenly count more than us podcasters?

19:39.520 --> 19:40.160
I think so.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.520
I live with my two older brothers and their girlfriends.

19:43.520 --> 19:47.360
Someone keeps putting our hand soap in the shower

19:47.360 --> 19:50.720
despite there being an abundance of communal body wash.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.120
It's a fancier bottle than what we usually buy,

19:53.120 --> 19:54.160
so maybe they're confused.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.080
But I've even circled hand soap in black marker.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.560
It sounded like a delight.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.400
Does this person know what they're doing?

20:04.400 --> 20:05.680
Should I let this happen?

20:06.240 --> 20:09.200
Is there some way I could ask my roommates about their soap choices

20:09.200 --> 20:11.760
without learning more about them than I could ever want to know?

20:11.760 --> 20:17.520
That's from my brother, my brother, my hand soap and me in Michigan.

20:17.520 --> 20:21.840
I thought that hand soap in the shower was really just sort of the,

20:24.480 --> 20:29.120
that whole market was sort of run by like beach rental houses

20:29.120 --> 20:30.960
where you roll up in their sad shower

20:30.960 --> 20:32.320
and there's nothing inside of it

20:32.320 --> 20:35.440
except for like a little bit of hand soap in a squeeze bottle.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.760
And you're like, I guess this'll get me clean.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.360
Thanks, Airbnb renters.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.680
Yeah, this'll do, I guess.

20:42.560 --> 20:45.040
I guess here's the thing, question asker.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.560
If it cleans the skin on your hands,

20:48.560 --> 20:52.000
it probably does the rest of your body too, right?

20:53.600 --> 20:59.200
It's not like it's perfectly suited just for your hand skin.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.240
This is what, at 442?

21:02.240 --> 21:03.600
441, 442?

21:03.600 --> 21:05.120
I think it's 442.

21:05.120 --> 21:10.000
That means it's been 441 episodes since we have talked about whether,

21:11.040 --> 21:17.200
you know, sudsy shower liquids are effectively interchangeable.

21:17.200 --> 21:17.440
Yes.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.080
And I don't know if y'all's position have changed.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.160
I think that the hand soap is gonna get you there,

21:22.160 --> 21:26.800
but I also think hand soap to, you know, a big thing of body wash,

21:27.520 --> 21:30.080
you are paying more per ounce with the hand soap.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.320
So like from a monetary perspective, I get it.

21:32.320 --> 21:35.600
But I mean, it's all sudsy bubble stuff.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.280
You can use that shit anywhere.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.560
What about dish soap?

21:38.560 --> 21:39.520
Now we're into it.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.800
Now we're in here.

21:40.800 --> 21:45.120
Because apparently like one drop of Dawn

21:45.120 --> 21:48.480
is enough to do a whole sinkload of dishes.

21:48.480 --> 21:48.880
Yeah.

21:48.880 --> 21:49.360
Yeah.

21:49.360 --> 21:55.280
So I feel like three drops of Dawn would do a whole sinkload of Travis.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.280
And with my porcelain China doll skin,

21:58.720 --> 22:00.080
it's gonna get me there, I think.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.200
Man, Trav.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.800
Can we talk about something for a second?

22:03.440 --> 22:03.680
Yeah.

22:03.680 --> 22:04.320
Yeah.

22:04.320 --> 22:09.280
Travis just said a drop of Dawn would wash a sink full of dishes.

22:10.240 --> 22:12.240
I'm sitting here and I'm telling you guys,

22:14.000 --> 22:19.280
I'm realizing now I don't know how to wash dishes by the sink full.

22:19.280 --> 22:20.400
I don't even know.

22:21.280 --> 22:24.560
I couldn't soak dishes in the sink if I wanted to.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.040
I don't know how to do that.

22:27.040 --> 22:31.840
I have the little stick that's full of soap and a sponge on the end

22:31.840 --> 22:33.360
that I wash the dishes with.

22:33.360 --> 22:34.560
I don't know how to do that.

22:34.560 --> 22:35.680
Do you guys know how to do that?

22:36.720 --> 22:37.520
How to wash dishes?

22:37.520 --> 22:38.400
How to wash dishes, bud?

22:38.400 --> 22:39.120
No.

22:39.120 --> 22:39.840
Like a sink.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.240
If you want to wash a sink full of dishes, right?

22:42.240 --> 22:45.520
Where it's like the sink is full of water and soap

22:45.520 --> 22:47.840
and they're soaking and then you're loving it.

22:47.840 --> 22:48.080
Yeah.

22:48.080 --> 22:48.640
Do you know how to...

22:48.640 --> 22:49.840
Would you know how to...

22:49.840 --> 22:51.120
I would have to upturn...

22:51.920 --> 22:56.800
I think I'd have to upturn a small plate to cover the drain of the sink.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.000
Is that what people were doing?

22:59.440 --> 23:00.240
Oh my goodness gracious.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.600
Oh my God, Justin.

23:01.600 --> 23:05.280
Justin, you have two human children that you take care of.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.400
Yeah, I've done the plate thing before.

23:08.400 --> 23:11.840
Is there another way that people are washing dishes by the sink full?

23:11.840 --> 23:15.840
I mean, Justin also has Archibald who does most of this stuff.

23:15.840 --> 23:16.320
Yes, that's true.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.760
He handles most of this stuff for him.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.400
Justin's trained orangutan.

23:20.400 --> 23:27.120
Oh, and the girls just love Archibald playing.

23:27.120 --> 23:27.600
Oh, yeah.

23:28.160 --> 23:28.880
Oh, yeah.

23:28.880 --> 23:29.360
He can get...

23:29.360 --> 23:30.720
And so do the ladies.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.080
Yeah, the ladies love him.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.960
Ladies love cool Archibald.

23:34.960 --> 23:38.000
He gets, you know, he gets pretty strong and angry sometimes.

23:38.000 --> 23:38.800
Oh, yeah.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.840
Hey guys, don't get so distracted by this great new character

23:41.840 --> 23:43.200
that you forget to dunk on me.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.760
We were trying to save you because you're our brother and we love you.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.560
Yeah, it's bizarre, dude.

23:48.560 --> 23:48.880
I don't know what would I...

23:48.880 --> 23:50.480
I do dishes every week.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.360
Okay, how?

23:51.360 --> 23:52.160
By fucking...

23:52.160 --> 23:53.360
What are you talking about?

23:53.360 --> 23:58.160
By getting them wet and soapy and then scrubbing them with a sponge

23:58.160 --> 24:00.560
and then rinsing them off and then putting them in a dryer.

24:00.560 --> 24:01.840
What the fuck are you talking about?

24:01.840 --> 24:02.320
I don't have...

24:02.320 --> 24:07.120
The same way human beings have kept water from running out of a thing forever.

24:07.120 --> 24:07.840
It's not fucking active.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.080
You have access to an Amazon account.

24:10.080 --> 24:14.080
Have not had a plug for a decade and I'm doing fine.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.440
I'm doing fine.

24:15.440 --> 24:20.640
Justin Celesta, if you can hear me, order Sink Drain Plug from Amazon now.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.200
It's not fucking plutonium juice.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.040
You don't have to handle it special.

24:25.040 --> 24:27.760
You wash it like you would wash a car, a child.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.760
Hey, let me ask you guys a question.

24:29.760 --> 24:30.080
Yes.

24:30.960 --> 24:36.800
A big bottle of bubble liquid that you would use to blow bubbles for a child to enjoy?

24:36.800 --> 24:38.480
You think you can get clean with that shit?

24:39.920 --> 24:41.600
Well, it's got glycerin in there.

24:42.480 --> 24:42.800
Yeah.

24:42.800 --> 24:43.760
So you can get slippery.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.440
You want to get slippery.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.720
Maybe some people like that.

24:46.720 --> 24:51.200
If you go down a slipping slide covered in dish soap, is that like a shower?

24:51.200 --> 24:51.760
I think that'll get...

24:51.760 --> 24:52.080
Yep.

24:52.640 --> 24:55.120
Most stuff's like a shower if you really think about it.

24:55.120 --> 24:55.760
I made a mess.

24:55.760 --> 25:00.560
So things are like showers and poetry so far if I'm keeping track.

25:00.560 --> 25:06.560
I did a mess up as I bought some shampoo to replace my last shampoo plus conditioner,

25:06.560 --> 25:07.360
obviously.

25:07.360 --> 25:08.560
I'm not going to do that twice.

25:08.560 --> 25:12.000
I bought some shampoo plus conditioner to replace my old shampoo plus conditioner.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.480
And then today, when I was looking at my body wash, I noticed on the label, it said,

25:17.840 --> 25:20.960
also, it's also shampoo.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.400
I don't know how they put it.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.560
I think they had like a more professional way of putting it.

25:24.560 --> 25:27.280
But it's like, this is also shampoo in here.

25:27.280 --> 25:30.160
And then I had to look at that new bottle and just be kind of sad because it's like,

25:30.160 --> 25:33.680
I'm never, ever going to use you.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.280
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

25:35.280 --> 25:40.320
If I could have one all just in cleaning liquid, of course I'm going to do that.

25:40.320 --> 25:45.520
Well, can we, oh, this is like the good, the special good burger sauce.

25:46.160 --> 25:51.200
What if we mix together some of your good body wash, some really good smelling stuff.

25:51.200 --> 25:54.960
And I'm talking about splurging for some Axe shit.

25:54.960 --> 25:59.760
The real deal, Holyfield good smelling good stuff like Axe.

25:59.760 --> 26:04.800
And then you put a little bit of, you know, Pantene Pro-V conditioner for, you know,

26:04.800 --> 26:11.120
severely dry damaged hair and you mix that cream in and then if you want a little bit

26:11.120 --> 26:14.000
of shampoo in there, maybe a little herbal essences.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.080
So you can, like in the commercials, have a cum while doing the shower.

26:20.640 --> 26:21.680
I think this is great.

26:21.680 --> 26:25.040
And it can be your all-in-one special shower stuff.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.880
Gets you clean, gets you conditioned, gets your cum out.

26:30.480 --> 26:31.680
Get your cum out.

26:31.680 --> 26:33.600
Get clean inside and out.

26:33.600 --> 26:37.120
Get it clean going on the hair, the body, and get you a cum out.

26:39.360 --> 26:43.360
I'm a child because I'll always laugh at the phrase, get your cum out.

26:44.000 --> 26:44.880
I mean, it's new.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.400
You don't have to be ashamed of that.

26:46.400 --> 26:50.480
Yeah, and I don't think a child, if a child laughed at that, I would be very perturbed.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.120
It's a bold new idea in comedy.

26:53.120 --> 26:56.080
Like we can't just, can't just write it off that quickly.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.320
Uh, should we go to the money zone, I think?

26:58.320 --> 27:07.840
Yeah, I'd love that.

27:10.880 --> 27:16.320
Uh, folks, our first sponsor this week is Casper.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.080
Ah, speaking of getting a cum out, right?

27:18.640 --> 27:19.040
I-

27:19.040 --> 27:19.680
Wait, what?

27:19.680 --> 27:20.560
That's nothing.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.000
I don't know how to say it.

28:50.720 --> 28:51.600
There, there.

28:51.600 --> 28:52.560
That's the ad.

So Juice, you do that.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.360

Very good thing to do.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.320
actors like Patton Oswalt.

30:12.320 --> 30:18.000
So the vampire from the future sleeps in the dude's studio during the day and they hunt

30:18.000 --> 30:18.720
monsters at night.

30:18.720 --> 30:20.880
It's Blade meets the Odd Couple.

Adam Scott and Jane Levy.

30:24.080 --> 30:24.960
Come on, Cory.

30:25.600 --> 30:28.160
She's too serious, too business-y.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.760
She doesn't know the hokey pokey.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.840
She'll learn what it's all about.

30:34.320 --> 30:35.840
Busy Phillips and Dave Koechner.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.120
Baby, this is family.

30:37.120 --> 30:41.920
My uncle, Tell, who showed his wiener to Cinderella at Disneyland is family.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.520
Do you want him staying with us?

30:43.520 --> 30:45.760
He did stay with us for three months.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.360
And he was a delight.

30:48.880 --> 30:52.880
A new pilot every month only on Dead Pilot Society for maximum fun.

30:54.080 --> 30:59.600
Well, I am extremely excited right now because we have been joined here in the My Brother,

30:59.600 --> 31:03.360
My Brother, Me chuckle pit by none other than Bridget Lancaster.

31:03.360 --> 31:06.080
She's one of the hosts of America's Test Kitchen.

31:06.080 --> 31:07.760
She's been with the show since it launched.

31:08.480 --> 31:14.800
She is the host of America's Test Kitchen's new show, podcast, in this case called Proof.

31:15.600 --> 31:20.640
And she is also on this podcast, My Brother, My Brother, Me.

31:20.640 --> 31:26.960
So it may seem like a contradiction, but I assure you she is present.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.840
Her name is Bridget Lancaster and she is here with us.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.960
Bridget Lancaster, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.280
I can't even believe I'm here.

31:35.280 --> 31:37.840
I mean, this is like a West Virginia homecoming.

31:38.640 --> 31:39.680
It kind of is.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.800
I learned this that you grew up in Cross Lanes.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.600
Is that correct?

31:43.600 --> 31:44.880
I sure did.

31:44.880 --> 31:45.360
Yeah.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.760
And I worked at the Huntington Mall, believe it or not.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.280
Get out of town.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.400
Wait, where at?

31:50.400 --> 31:53.040
As a chef, I have to imagine it was Olive Garden.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.080
Were you at the Big Loafer?

31:55.200 --> 31:56.400
It wasn't even food.

31:56.400 --> 31:57.680
I was at the Benetton.

32:00.240 --> 32:00.640
Yeah.

32:00.640 --> 32:01.760
High end folks here.

32:01.760 --> 32:04.000
Wait, Griffin, did you ever work at the Huntington Mall?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.480
Because if so, that would be all four of us.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.280
Unfortunately, no.

32:07.280 --> 32:09.360
I think I'm the only one who escaped its clutches.

32:09.360 --> 32:09.920
No.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.600
See, I worked at the Best Buy.

32:11.600 --> 32:15.920
Justin, I believe you were at both the Olive Garden and the Babbage's.

32:15.920 --> 32:16.800
Is that correct?

32:16.800 --> 32:20.640
I was at the Olive Garden, the Babbage's, the Best Buy, the Toys R Us.

32:20.640 --> 32:21.920
He was all over that mall.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.360
Yeah, and the Olive Garden.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.840
I worked at five different mall area places.

32:26.560 --> 32:28.320
But now I work at America's Test Kitchen.

32:28.320 --> 32:28.800
Nope.

32:28.800 --> 32:29.120
That's-

32:29.120 --> 32:29.840
What?

32:29.840 --> 32:30.480
That's Bridget, actually.

32:30.480 --> 32:30.980
You do.

32:30.980 --> 32:32.500
Anyway, no.

32:32.500 --> 32:38.180
So tell me, this new podcast, Proof, is it a podcast adaptation of the Gwyneth Paltrow,

32:38.180 --> 32:40.980
Anthony Hopkins movie, Proof?

32:40.980 --> 32:41.540
You nailed it.

32:41.540 --> 32:43.940
That joke's not going anywhere.

32:46.100 --> 32:48.980
It's probably exactly the opposite of that, I would say.

32:50.500 --> 32:54.580
As close as it would get to Anthony Hopkins or Sir Anthony Hopkins, right,

32:55.380 --> 33:00.020
would be maybe we would do an episode on do fava beans and Chianti actually go together.

33:00.020 --> 33:01.780
Oh, okay.

33:01.780 --> 33:05.620
Hey, did you know that the guy who directed that movie, as well as Shakespeare in Love

33:05.620 --> 33:09.300
and the Best Exotic Mirror Gold Hotel, his name is John Madden?

33:09.300 --> 33:10.340
That doesn't seem right.

33:11.860 --> 33:13.620
That doesn't seem like it should be allowed.

33:13.620 --> 33:14.340
John Madden?

33:15.860 --> 33:16.740
It's the same guy.

33:17.380 --> 33:19.220
He's a huge football man, I guess.

33:19.220 --> 33:23.460
We have a lot of questions from listeners about food and cooking.

33:25.620 --> 33:27.540
I want to ask one, though, before we get started.

33:27.540 --> 33:33.380
Bridget, what food are you most embarrassed about very much enjoying?

33:33.380 --> 33:37.620
Just like, what kind of garbage do you really get down on?

33:38.420 --> 33:40.180
God, that list is long.

33:40.180 --> 33:41.620
I mean, it is really long.

33:41.620 --> 33:42.420
I love John food.

33:42.420 --> 33:43.780
Yeah, but don't pull out one.

33:43.780 --> 33:47.220
Bridget, I don't want you to pull out one that makes you sound like a woman of the people.

33:47.220 --> 33:49.700
You know, like, I don't want a populist choice here.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.460
I want something nasty.

33:51.460 --> 33:53.300
Yeah, I don't want like potato chips.

33:53.300 --> 33:54.260
Yeah, I was like, no, no, no.

33:54.260 --> 33:54.980
Something gross.

33:54.980 --> 33:55.940
Yeah, no way.

33:55.940 --> 33:59.540
All right, I got one.

33:59.540 --> 34:00.500
Yeah, I got one.

34:00.500 --> 34:03.780
Although, you know, I'm saying it doesn't sound gross to me, which is why I eat it.

34:03.780 --> 34:07.780
But I love microwaved bologna.

34:10.420 --> 34:11.700
What in the world?

34:11.700 --> 34:14.100
I didn't even know that was a thing you could do.

34:14.100 --> 34:19.620
I assume you mean bologna that you microwave, not like a freeze-dried thing.

34:19.620 --> 34:22.740
Don't eat that bologna you haven't microwaved it yet.

34:22.740 --> 34:24.580
Okay, so I got to tell you why.

34:24.580 --> 34:27.380
And I guess you could do it on the stovetop too, but I'm just really impatient.

34:27.380 --> 34:33.060
So you take a slice of bologna and you got to cut these little release cuts around it.

34:33.060 --> 34:35.700
Otherwise, it'll cup up as it cooks.

34:35.700 --> 34:39.220
Some people like the cup because it captures all the bologna sweat right there.

34:39.220 --> 34:41.940
You're talking about like fried bologna.

34:41.940 --> 34:43.460
It's basically fried bologna.

34:43.460 --> 34:44.980
And then I talk about cheese.

34:44.980 --> 34:50.180
And then as it cooks, it turns into, it's basically a hot dog and cheese in flat form.

34:50.180 --> 34:50.660
I know.

34:50.660 --> 34:52.020
Oh, my goodness.

34:52.020 --> 34:56.420
You have just given me the strongest sense memory that one time I remember spending the

34:56.420 --> 35:01.460
night at my friend Chris's house when I was like 10 and he microwaved a slice of bologna

35:01.460 --> 35:06.340
and put like pizza sauce and mozzarella on it and like served it to me like bologna pizza.

35:09.140 --> 35:12.980
I thought this would be like a fun food segment where I would learn about great foods.

35:12.980 --> 35:15.060
And now I never want to eat ever again.

35:15.060 --> 35:19.540
I want to go buy a lifetime supply of Soylent and just kind of give the rest of it up.

35:19.540 --> 35:21.540
Oh, come on.

35:21.540 --> 35:25.780
I would hate that I disillusioned you a little bit.

35:25.780 --> 35:29.380
It has been a while since I've had my microwave bologna treat.

35:29.380 --> 35:32.660
Bridget, to be fair, with a grooving stomach, it would probably be better if we stopped

35:32.660 --> 35:33.620
eating solid food.

35:36.100 --> 35:39.220
Well, that would be maybe pureed bologna would be the next.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.340
Yes, now we're talking.

35:40.980 --> 35:41.940
Now you're cooking.

35:42.580 --> 35:44.580
You culinary expert, you.

35:44.580 --> 35:45.380
That's perfect.

35:45.940 --> 35:47.940
Okay, I have to ask a question.

35:47.940 --> 35:48.580
That's the law.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.740
I am obsessed with cheese platters.

35:50.740 --> 35:54.660
Whenever I see one on a menu at a restaurant, I try to order it.

35:55.300 --> 35:59.460
Unfortunately, they're often very expensive and contain very small samples of cheese.

36:00.020 --> 36:04.100
I've tried to recreate the magic at home, but it's just not the same.

36:04.100 --> 36:08.660
How can I recreate a restaurant worthy cheese platter at home without breaking the bank?

36:08.660 --> 36:10.660
That's from cheese obsessed in Vermont.

36:11.860 --> 36:14.100
Well, they could just walk right outside there in Vermont.

36:14.100 --> 36:16.740
I mean, cheese hangs from the trees up there.

36:16.740 --> 36:18.740
Yes, that explains everything.

36:18.740 --> 36:19.940
Yeah, well, okay.

36:19.940 --> 36:23.140
So I think a good cheese platter has to have three kinds of cheese.

36:23.140 --> 36:27.940
Usually there's a cheddar involved, a nice sharp cheddar, and then a blue.

36:29.300 --> 36:32.900
Neither cheddar nor blue has to be very expensive.

36:32.900 --> 36:34.020
You can get pretty good blue.

36:34.820 --> 36:39.780
The third one is where I feel like you can kind of go off the rails and get really fancy

36:39.780 --> 36:40.100
if you want.

36:40.100 --> 36:44.500
You can have an aged goat cheese or something tangy.

36:44.500 --> 36:49.860
Something to offset the funk of the blue and the sharpness of the cheddar.

36:49.860 --> 36:53.460
But I mean, you know, three cheeses, that's all you need, three cheese.

36:54.740 --> 36:57.140
And the third cheese you're saying is the wild.

36:57.140 --> 37:00.420
The other two cheeses, Locke, you know they're going to be good.

37:00.420 --> 37:00.900
Yes.

37:00.900 --> 37:05.700
The third cheese, you can get something challenging.

37:05.700 --> 37:08.340
That's where your personality shows through.

37:08.340 --> 37:08.900
You know what I mean?

37:08.900 --> 37:12.980
That's where it's like, oh yeah, Doug, Doug only does cheese with M&Ms in it.

37:12.980 --> 37:15.780
That guy, when he does the cheese slate.

37:15.780 --> 37:18.420
Right, you know you're going to get Gouda with Doug.

37:18.420 --> 37:22.100
And he's going to make a joke about it and say like, as Gouda as it gets or whatever,

37:22.100 --> 37:22.980
that's Doug.

37:22.980 --> 37:25.540
And then you get to say, I can't even bear it any longer.

37:25.540 --> 37:26.820
Oh my God.

37:26.820 --> 37:28.100
Yowza, Yowza.

37:28.100 --> 37:28.820
Downtown.

37:28.820 --> 37:29.780
Yowza Machi.

37:29.780 --> 37:33.220
So like, if you also, if you don't want to leave the house, you can usually just make

37:33.220 --> 37:34.660
one out of stuff you got lying around.

37:34.660 --> 37:39.380
You could do one with like shredded cheese and then some cream, like a big mound of cream cheese.

37:39.380 --> 37:39.940
Cheetos.

37:39.940 --> 37:42.740
And some Cheetos that you just have there.

37:42.740 --> 37:44.660
Yeah, crushed Cheez-Its.

37:44.660 --> 37:49.940
I would probably do like, my cheddar and blue would be cheap and bad.

37:49.940 --> 37:55.300
And then my third powerful cheese, I would get something incredibly, incredibly powerful

37:55.300 --> 37:57.540
because no one's going to remember the other two anyway.

37:57.540 --> 38:00.020
Because my third cheese is so, so important.

38:00.660 --> 38:01.860
Like a gold cheese.

38:03.220 --> 38:08.820
Eating a hateful cheese that you know is going to be quite bad, it's a really great way of

38:08.820 --> 38:11.620
becoming the monster here in 2019, I feel like.

38:11.620 --> 38:13.780
That would be the best name for a cheese shop.

38:13.780 --> 38:14.820
The hateful cheese.

38:14.820 --> 38:15.860
The hateful cheese.

38:15.860 --> 38:18.260
That's why people put that stinky blue on there, right?

38:18.260 --> 38:20.020
Like that's the challenge cheese.

38:20.020 --> 38:23.220
That's the cheese of like, we know you're not going to finish that one.

38:23.220 --> 38:23.780
Nobody wants that.

38:23.780 --> 38:24.260
Oh yeah.

38:24.260 --> 38:28.100
No, if it smells like a foot, you know, people are just going to start walking away.

38:28.100 --> 38:32.580
Hey, we talk about charcuterie a lot, including actually I think later in this episode, which

38:32.580 --> 38:34.580
we recorded before this bit, which is strange.

38:34.580 --> 38:38.180
But are you supposed to stack it all up like a sandwich and go for it that way?

38:38.180 --> 38:40.500
Or are you really supposed to enjoy each thing one at a time?

38:40.500 --> 38:41.860
You can do whatever you want.

38:41.860 --> 38:44.180
You could stack it all up Scooby Doo style if you want.

38:46.180 --> 38:50.340
Or just take a big, you know, hammer to it and mash it all into one big lump.

38:50.340 --> 38:51.460
Oh, now we're talking.

38:51.460 --> 38:53.940
Okay, now Bridget, you're an expert.

38:53.940 --> 38:57.460
You cannot tell people that because they were going to have people going off smash

38:57.460 --> 39:00.340
their charcuterie with hammers and say, it's okay, Bridget says, fried.

39:00.340 --> 39:01.460
I have a video of that.

39:02.180 --> 39:08.020
I went to a really bougie place recently in Vegas where the dude like had like a whole

39:08.020 --> 39:13.460
cheese cart and he asked us some questions like, I don't know, sommelier, which I also

39:13.460 --> 39:19.140
think is BS, but he asked us some questions and then he said, okay, I think these are

39:19.140 --> 39:20.900
the three cheeses for you.

39:20.900 --> 39:21.940
Oh, no.

39:21.940 --> 39:22.980
That's not real, right?

39:23.940 --> 39:27.860
He just had three cheeses in mind he was already going to give us because those are the cheeses

39:27.860 --> 39:28.420
he had thought of.

39:28.420 --> 39:29.940
He had three cheeses in his pocket.

39:29.940 --> 39:30.580
Yeah.

39:30.580 --> 39:34.340
I don't understand these places because they make you automatically feel like you're not

39:34.340 --> 39:35.940
good enough for their cheese.

39:35.940 --> 39:36.340
I'm not.

39:36.340 --> 39:39.060
To be fair, I wasn't.

39:39.060 --> 39:43.300
And I'm not saying, I want to say, the knowledge of wine isn't bunk.

39:43.300 --> 39:47.540
It's the idea of saying this wine is better than this wine because of notes of-

39:47.540 --> 39:48.580
Own it, Travis.

39:48.580 --> 39:48.980
Own it.

39:48.980 --> 39:49.780
You hate wine.

39:49.780 --> 39:50.900
You hate wine people.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.580
I think Bridget's gonna agree with me here.

39:52.580 --> 39:56.020
The big problem with the cheese plate is how all the cheese on it is raw.

39:58.580 --> 40:04.260
I've been pretty firm on my sense that raw cheese is inedible and it should always be

40:04.260 --> 40:06.500
melted into a dip or pizza topping.

40:06.500 --> 40:09.940
Do you feel pretty much that same way as me, Bridget?

40:10.660 --> 40:16.420
I will say that slightly warmed cheese tastes a lot better than cold cheese just put right

40:16.420 --> 40:16.740
out there.

40:17.940 --> 40:19.140
She is meeting you halfway.

40:19.140 --> 40:20.660
That is such a generous response.

40:20.660 --> 40:21.700
I'm just going to accept it.

40:23.940 --> 40:28.660
I recently started living alone and my cooking skills aren't that great.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.420
I also don't have a lot of time to cook.

40:30.420 --> 40:33.940
What are foods that last a long time in the fridge that I can make multiple meals out

40:33.940 --> 40:34.660
of during the week?

40:35.700 --> 40:36.420
Oh, boy.

40:36.420 --> 40:42.580
Well, I would say, well, depending on if they have any limitations, if they like meat or

40:43.220 --> 40:49.940
anything like that, I would say that cooking a big batch of beans and rice and then you

40:49.940 --> 40:54.740
can keep pulling from it and adding a little bit of chicken or steak or chopped vegetables,

40:54.740 --> 40:55.780
things like that.

40:55.780 --> 40:59.460
So I think if you have like what I do at home, I do a cook day.

40:59.460 --> 41:03.540
I have a couple of big cook days where I'll cook a big batch of something and

41:03.540 --> 41:05.700
I'll keep that for leftovers for my kids and stuff.

41:05.700 --> 41:10.420
And so I don't have to start from ground zero every single time for like beans and

41:10.420 --> 41:11.380
things like that.

41:11.380 --> 41:12.340
I would also...

41:12.340 --> 41:13.140
Hi, I'm Travis.

41:13.140 --> 41:14.900
I'm the other food expert on this podcast.

41:16.340 --> 41:17.620
Suvi is...

41:17.620 --> 41:19.220
Griffin got me into it.

41:19.220 --> 41:21.620
Oh, I've been wondering when we were going to get into this.

41:21.620 --> 41:23.140
You don't have to know anything.

41:23.780 --> 41:30.420
And like you throw that bag into some water with the Suvi magic wand going and then you

41:30.420 --> 41:35.220
walk away and you can come back like three, four, 24 hour, whatever, hours later and it's

41:35.220 --> 41:35.940
done.

41:35.940 --> 41:37.700
It's kind of amazing, isn't it?

41:37.700 --> 41:38.340
I love this.

41:38.340 --> 41:39.380
I love this meat bath.

41:39.380 --> 41:40.020
I was so excited.

41:40.020 --> 41:41.700
I got one for Justin a couple of years ago.

41:41.700 --> 41:42.820
I got one for Travis.

41:42.820 --> 41:43.860
Justin, why don't you chime in?

41:43.860 --> 41:45.060
What have you been Suvi-ing, babe?

41:45.700 --> 41:47.620
What you got going on in that meat bath?

41:49.300 --> 41:52.100
That I got you as a gift that I thought you'd love like two years ago?

41:52.100 --> 41:55.140
Is this a real Suvi thing or are you guys just in a jacuzzi right now?

41:55.140 --> 42:01.860
No, Griffin really did get me a Suvi thing that really is still in the pantry unopened.

42:01.860 --> 42:05.460
But Griffin, I feel like it's going to be soon, bud.

42:05.460 --> 42:09.620
I just have been waiting for a real special time for me and my family.

42:09.620 --> 42:14.900
Haven't I balanced it out enough by literally using it every day for the last three weeks?

42:14.900 --> 42:15.860
Yeah, I mean, you're a good one.

42:15.860 --> 42:16.500
You're a good one.

42:16.500 --> 42:16.980
Thank you.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.060
Let's see.

42:19.060 --> 42:24.420
For my birthday, my friend bought me a very fancy chef's knife, something I've wanted

42:24.420 --> 42:25.700
for quite some time.

42:25.700 --> 42:29.540
But as I started cooking meal for myself and my partner, I couldn't bring myself to remove

42:29.540 --> 42:32.340
this beautiful blade from its cardboard packaging.

42:32.340 --> 42:34.020
It looks so pristine and perfect.

42:34.020 --> 42:37.220
It seems a shame to use it for something as mundane as chopping tomatoes.

42:37.220 --> 42:41.860
I use my old nasty chef's knives to prepare the meal instead.

42:41.860 --> 42:45.220
But now I'm afraid of never using this wonderful blade I've been gifted.

42:45.220 --> 42:46.020
Help!

42:46.020 --> 42:48.980
How do I break in my new knife in an appropriate way?

42:48.980 --> 42:52.020
Or should I just get it over with and chop the ding-dang mushrooms?

42:52.020 --> 42:54.660
That's from scared of slicing in Sacramento.

42:54.660 --> 42:56.100
I love that question.

42:56.100 --> 42:56.900
It's so good.

42:57.460 --> 42:59.300
That actually happens with whole kitchens.

42:59.300 --> 43:03.860
People renovate their kitchen and then they don't cook at all because they don't want

43:03.860 --> 43:04.740
to mess it up.

43:04.740 --> 43:05.620
And I get that.

43:05.620 --> 43:09.380
But I'd say any great meal would be worth using that knife.

43:09.380 --> 43:14.660
And I tell you what, anything that you use a just right out of the package knife on is

43:14.660 --> 43:18.740
going to make it feel like a million dollar ingredient because it's just going to slide

43:18.740 --> 43:19.700
right through it.

43:19.700 --> 43:27.620
For Christmas, Justin got me a knife block that is a magnetic, like, spinning 360, like,

43:27.620 --> 43:30.500
wooden knife block that I believe-

43:30.500 --> 43:34.180
Did I get that knife block because it was the number one most recommended knife block

43:34.180 --> 43:36.580
by America's Test Kitchen chosen as the best knife block?

43:36.580 --> 43:37.460
Indeed I did.

43:37.460 --> 43:38.260
Yes, that is accurate.

43:38.260 --> 43:43.380
And I find that that also makes me use my knives way more often because one, they're

43:43.380 --> 43:45.220
visible, so I think to use them.

43:45.220 --> 43:48.660
But two, magnets are basically magic.

43:48.660 --> 43:52.740
And, like, I can kind of, from across the room, throw the knife at the block and it

43:52.740 --> 43:53.780
sticks to it.

43:53.780 --> 43:55.380
Oh, that's the best.

43:55.380 --> 44:00.020
Every time I watch Kill Bill and Hattori Hanzo does that in the kitchen, he, like, throws

44:00.020 --> 44:01.860
the knife and it gets caught in the net.

44:01.860 --> 44:05.860
And that's appropriate because whenever I get my knife sharpened at the farmer's market

44:05.860 --> 44:09.460
and I bring it home, I'm very much in this person's shoes where I'm like, this is Hattori

44:09.460 --> 44:10.660
Hanzo's steel.

44:10.660 --> 44:11.940
It's now ornamental.

44:11.940 --> 44:13.540
It now has sentimental value.

44:13.540 --> 44:16.980
I cannot risk dulling this beautiful blade.

44:16.980 --> 44:18.420
Oh, you have to.

44:18.420 --> 44:19.460
You absolutely have to.

44:19.460 --> 44:22.260
I mean, using a dull blade is the worst thing you can do.

44:22.260 --> 44:26.020
It's just going to skip right off the food and it's going to find your finger every single

44:26.020 --> 44:26.520
time.

44:27.460 --> 44:29.460
Well, now I never want to cook again.

44:29.460 --> 44:30.980
Should I wear chainmail gloves?

44:30.980 --> 44:31.620
Is that a thing?

44:32.660 --> 44:36.500
My friend got one of those because he used to run the slicer at Arby's.

44:37.140 --> 44:42.900
So my friend had one that we use for cooking all the time because there is little more

44:42.900 --> 44:46.980
empowering than cooking with a chainmail glove because it's like, I don't care.

44:46.980 --> 44:48.100
I'll do whatever I want.

44:48.100 --> 44:49.700
Cut where I want, how I want.

44:49.700 --> 44:51.380
It is literally medieval, right?

44:51.380 --> 44:54.180
It puts you back and you want these giant turkey legs.

44:54.180 --> 44:58.180
They use them a lot for shucking oysters up here, the chainmail gloves and things like

44:58.180 --> 44:58.980
that.

44:58.980 --> 45:03.140
I would worry that I'd be like, well, I've already got the glove.

45:03.700 --> 45:06.260
I should just go ahead and buy a full chainmail suit of armor.

45:06.820 --> 45:08.340
Why would that worry you?

45:08.340 --> 45:10.340
Yeah, that would be kind of amazing.

45:10.900 --> 45:15.140
I've been watching a lot of Marie Kondo and I don't think she'd be so down on me owning

45:15.140 --> 45:16.900
a whole set of chainmail armor.

45:16.900 --> 45:20.260
I think it would spark me a little bit of joy right now, but then very quickly it would

45:20.260 --> 45:21.300
just be a lot of armor.

45:21.300 --> 45:22.980
But it probably folds into nothing.

45:23.940 --> 45:25.700
That might be a good point, yeah.

45:25.700 --> 45:29.540
And you know, when the shit hits the fan, I'll be the one wearing chainmail.

45:29.540 --> 45:30.420
That's true.

45:30.420 --> 45:31.700
And she won't be.

45:31.700 --> 45:32.820
She'll be like, where's all my-

45:32.820 --> 45:35.060
And then finally you can fight Marie Kondo.

45:35.060 --> 45:36.980
She'll be like, where's my weapons and armor?

45:36.980 --> 45:38.660
That's right, I threw them all away.

45:38.660 --> 45:42.820
And chainmail is a great scrubber for really dirty pots and pans.

45:43.380 --> 45:43.620
See?

45:43.620 --> 45:44.340
For sure.

45:44.340 --> 45:45.860
So you can just rub them on your body.

45:45.860 --> 45:46.660
Yeah.

45:46.660 --> 45:48.340
You're like an all-in-one cooking robot.

45:49.140 --> 45:50.180
Get all the gristle off.

45:50.180 --> 45:52.660
It's like the third thing I need a video for, you know.

45:54.020 --> 45:58.020
Bridget Lancaster, thank you so much for joining us on My Brother, My Brother and Me.

45:58.020 --> 46:03.460
Where can people find your work, your body of work, if you will?

46:03.460 --> 46:03.860
Wow.

46:03.860 --> 46:07.140
So, well, I would love people to check out my Twitter account.

46:07.140 --> 46:09.540
It's at RealBeeLancaster.

46:09.540 --> 46:16.100
Or go to americastestkitchen.com, backslash proof, and you can read all about our new

46:16.100 --> 46:20.100
podcast, which I'm so thrilled and honored that you guys like so much.

46:20.100 --> 46:20.900
Really appreciate it.

46:21.780 --> 46:23.060
Oh, it is our pleasure.

46:23.060 --> 46:24.900
Thank you so much for being here, Bridget.

46:24.900 --> 46:28.420
And let's get back to the rest of the program.

46:29.220 --> 46:30.580
Hey, do you boys want a Yahoo?

46:31.140 --> 46:32.420
I do, thank you.

46:32.420 --> 46:34.420
I mean, I've got one here that was sent in by Elliot.

46:34.420 --> 46:34.900
Thanks, Elliot.

46:34.900 --> 46:37.780
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user, who I'm going to name.

46:37.780 --> 46:44.660
Percy asks, why don't they make an electric eye that moves and watches you and is like

46:44.660 --> 46:46.500
Google Home or Amazon Echo?

46:47.220 --> 46:47.780
Huh.

46:47.780 --> 46:52.020
Why don't they make a device like Google Home or Amazon Echo, but that is an eyeball and

46:52.020 --> 46:56.100
eyelids on a moving pole that watches you and follows its eyes on you everywhere you

46:56.100 --> 46:56.580
go.

46:56.580 --> 47:01.780
It blinks and it talks and it scans you and tells you what it thinks you need, like clothing

47:01.780 --> 47:02.740
or something like that.

47:02.740 --> 47:07.220
Can you fucking imagine if the eye in your house blinked at you and was like, you need

47:07.220 --> 47:07.780
a new shirt?

47:10.420 --> 47:15.940
Do you want me to talk to the little cylinder guy you got in the kitchen and make it get

47:15.940 --> 47:16.820
you a new shirt?

47:16.820 --> 47:17.620
Because I can do that.

47:17.620 --> 47:18.900
That's what you're wearing today?

47:18.900 --> 47:20.740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

47:20.740 --> 47:22.100
I'm going to order you some shoes.

47:22.820 --> 47:23.620
It is.

47:23.620 --> 47:30.180
I can see what they're kind of saying, because if you think about it in like an iRobot sense,

47:30.180 --> 47:35.780
you've basically just created like ears that lay on your counter, and I guess a mouth.

47:35.780 --> 47:36.100
Right.

47:36.100 --> 47:39.540
So like ears and mouth that lay on your counter, but like they desperately want to get up

47:39.540 --> 47:45.220
and look at you and follow you around the house and kill you and help you make breakfast

47:45.220 --> 47:46.980
and take you to high school.

47:46.980 --> 47:51.860
And say catty things about the clothes you're wearing and murder you, and yeah, for sure.

47:51.860 --> 47:56.500
Or you're like, oh, you know, whatever we want to call it, like, I got to think of a

47:56.500 --> 47:58.580
name that's not one of my go-to comedy names.

47:58.580 --> 48:00.900
Got it.

48:00.900 --> 48:01.620
Sugarman.

48:01.620 --> 48:02.740
Okay, go Sugarman.

48:02.740 --> 48:02.980
Yes.

48:03.540 --> 48:08.660
You say, Sugarman, order me, you know, another Whitman sampler.

48:08.660 --> 48:10.420
And Sugarman's like, no.

48:10.420 --> 48:12.100
And you're like, what?

48:12.100 --> 48:14.900
And you're like, you still have half a Whitman sampler left.

48:14.900 --> 48:16.180
I can see it in the counter.

48:16.180 --> 48:17.380
I can see it right there.

48:17.380 --> 48:21.780
When you finish that one, I'll order you another one, because you know if I get you another

48:21.780 --> 48:24.980
one, you're going to open that one up and you're immediately going to eat all the toffees

48:24.980 --> 48:26.420
and then leave half of it again.

48:26.420 --> 48:28.420
And I'm not going through this again with you, Travis.

48:28.420 --> 48:30.420
Now, let's talk about those jeans.

48:30.420 --> 48:31.620
What in the world?

48:33.060 --> 48:34.180
Are those jinkos?

48:34.980 --> 48:36.340
Well, actually, that might be back.

48:37.780 --> 48:40.900
Yeah, maybe it could just be Carson Kressley up there, like his eye.

48:40.900 --> 48:41.700
The queer eye.

48:42.580 --> 48:45.940
The queer eye floating in the air telling you these things.

48:45.940 --> 48:46.580
That could be good.

48:47.220 --> 48:50.420
So I took some stool softeners about an hour ago for personal reasons.

48:50.420 --> 48:53.780
And if I don't get up and address the effects of those right now, I'm going to blast off

48:53.780 --> 48:54.500
like Team Rocket.

48:54.500 --> 48:55.300
I'm so sorry, guys.

48:55.300 --> 49:00.740
So should Jessalyn and I just pick up your- oh, he's gone.

49:00.740 --> 49:02.900
So we'll just keep doing the show, I guess.

49:03.540 --> 49:07.060
Here's some other- hey, Travis, I know something we could talk about where Griffin's gone.

49:07.620 --> 49:08.020
Okay.

49:08.020 --> 49:09.700
Because I don't want to waste his time with you.

49:10.420 --> 49:10.740
Okay.

49:11.460 --> 49:18.820
Do you- if you had- obviously you said Sugarman, but really though, if you had an Android at

49:18.820 --> 49:27.940
your house, what celebrity would you most want its personality to embody?

49:28.980 --> 49:33.700
Oh, see, that's tough, Justin, because my first thought was to go with Oscar Isaac,

49:33.700 --> 49:37.300
who is the celebrity I most want to hang out with.

49:37.300 --> 49:37.700
Sure.

49:37.700 --> 49:42.020
And ask him about his time in a ska band in the early 2000s.

49:42.020 --> 49:42.660
Okay.

49:42.660 --> 49:45.620
But you got to pick somebody who-

49:45.620 --> 49:46.100
Yes.

49:46.100 --> 49:49.940
Like, they're going to do- like, they're not annoying for them to be there.

49:49.940 --> 49:51.540
It's not weird that they're there.

49:52.340 --> 49:56.420
But also, you're not so distracted by like, is that Chris Hemsworth?

49:56.420 --> 49:57.060
You know what I mean?

49:57.060 --> 49:57.700
Right.

49:57.700 --> 50:01.140
So do you have an answer for me, or where- so where are you at on this?

50:01.780 --> 50:02.660
I'm going to say...

50:05.220 --> 50:06.100
Dulé Hill.

50:06.100 --> 50:06.980
Dulé Hill!

50:07.860 --> 50:13.140
Yeah, I think that that would be like an easy, chill dude to hang out with.

50:13.140 --> 50:17.860
I was going to say Timothy Amundson, but I think I was just stuck, because I also thought

50:17.860 --> 50:18.740
James Roday.

50:18.740 --> 50:22.660
So basically, I just cycled through different actors from Psych.

50:23.380 --> 50:23.700
Right.

50:23.700 --> 50:25.860
I could also see Maggie Lawson.

50:25.860 --> 50:27.620
So basically, anyone-

50:27.620 --> 50:28.180
From Psych.

50:28.180 --> 50:29.140
Of the Psych.

50:29.140 --> 50:30.420
Anyone from Psych.

50:30.420 --> 50:31.060
Basically, anybody-

50:31.060 --> 50:32.420
Corbin Bernsen, maybe?

50:32.420 --> 50:33.780
I don't know much about him.

50:33.780 --> 50:38.900
I would like a- see, here's- doing him- I think mine would probably be John Larroquette.

50:39.460 --> 50:39.940
Because I feel-

50:39.940 --> 50:41.140
Wait, are you guys still going?

50:41.140 --> 50:42.180
That would be classy.

50:42.180 --> 50:42.980
Yeah.

50:42.980 --> 50:44.260
Wait, are you guys still going?

50:44.260 --> 50:50.100
Yeah, we were just talking about if we had a robot butler, what celebrity personality-

50:50.100 --> 50:54.020
Well, now this is- but if you guys kept doing stuff without me here, I am going to have

50:54.020 --> 50:57.060
to leave in the part where I explain that I took stool softeners and had to go.

50:57.060 --> 50:58.500
Yeah, exactly.

50:58.500 --> 50:59.060
So we got-

50:59.060 --> 50:59.460
Yeah, it was a good part-

50:59.460 --> 51:02.340
Justin said he didn't know how to plug up his sink, and you don't know how to plug up

51:02.340 --> 51:02.900
your bow.

51:02.900 --> 51:04.660
Yeah, it's all the same.

51:04.660 --> 51:07.300
Griffin, if you had a sle- I just said John Larroquette.

51:07.300 --> 51:15.860
Because I feel like kind of catty, definitely loves loyalty, but can be a little bit catty

51:15.860 --> 51:21.860
with people, but also hard worker, smartest guy in the room, would love that as my robot

51:21.860 --> 51:21.860
butler.

51:21.860 --> 51:24.980
And I said anyone from the cast of Psych.

51:24.980 --> 51:25.380
Yeah.

51:25.380 --> 51:26.580
Yeah, okay.

51:26.580 --> 51:29.380
So are we talking about robot butler, or are we still talking about the I?

51:29.380 --> 51:30.340
Because if it's a robot butler-

51:30.340 --> 51:31.140
It's both!

51:31.140 --> 51:32.180
Well, no, it's not, Trav.

51:32.180 --> 51:36.900
It's an android that lives in your house, and what celebrity

51:36.900 --> 51:38.500
personality would you most want them to have?

51:38.500 --> 51:40.100
It would change for me.

51:40.100 --> 51:44.740
If it's a robot butler with a robot bod, it would probably be Rosie O'Donnell, just

51:44.740 --> 51:46.500
because it would make me laugh all the time.

51:47.060 --> 51:50.500
And the other, if it was just an I floating above me, though, I would want something a

51:50.500 --> 51:52.820
bit more ominous, like a Tilda Swinton.

51:52.820 --> 52:00.900
If there was a Tilda Swinton telling me that I don't need more syrup, I have four bottles

52:00.900 --> 52:07.220
of syrup, stop buying syrup every time I go to the store, or also that my jeans are wack.

52:07.220 --> 52:10.820
I want that to be a stern Tilda.

52:10.820 --> 52:14.820
If we're talking about a floating I, I would want that to be more someone I'd be afraid

52:14.820 --> 52:15.620
to disappoint.

52:16.820 --> 52:18.420
So I would say a Bradley Whitford.

52:19.060 --> 52:19.700
Oh, yeah.

52:20.580 --> 52:25.220
No, I would say Toby Ziegler would be the one that I would most not want to disappoint.

52:25.220 --> 52:26.100
No way.

52:26.100 --> 52:27.780
Yeah, get a Schiff up there.

52:27.780 --> 52:28.420
Get Schiff in the picture.

52:28.420 --> 52:29.940
Get Schiff in the mix, all right.

52:29.940 --> 52:30.980
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

52:30.980 --> 52:32.740
Steven Weber, final answer.

52:32.740 --> 52:36.260
Steve, Justin, Travis goes hard for Steve, stands for Steve.

52:36.260 --> 52:37.220
Steven Weber is good.

52:38.020 --> 52:39.460
Steven Weber, final answer.

52:39.460 --> 52:40.500
We should be clear.

52:40.500 --> 52:46.020
We are talking about if you could sort of copy and paste the personality of that person

52:46.020 --> 52:47.540
so they would be around you all the time.

52:47.540 --> 52:53.220
You're not talking about literally sort of, you know, uploading Steven Weber's actual

52:53.220 --> 52:56.020
consciousness sort of, you know, Black Mirror style.

52:56.020 --> 53:00.180
Putting him in a jar like Brock Tune.

53:00.180 --> 53:01.140
Like Brock Tune.

53:03.540 --> 53:06.340
Anyway, here's another question I got.

53:06.340 --> 53:07.780
I work for an insurance company.

53:07.780 --> 53:11.060
Our corporate campus has several buildings serviced by an access road that feeds out

53:11.060 --> 53:12.260
to the main strip.

53:12.260 --> 53:16.020
The grounds are nicely landscaped, including a big pond near the entrance.

53:16.580 --> 53:21.140
Problem is, this has attracted a big flock of geese that wander the grounds.

53:21.140 --> 53:24.820
Sometimes they'll just walk out on the access road and cause traffic jams.

53:24.820 --> 53:28.740
The most heinous thing I saw were a gaggle of geese standing in front of the access road

53:28.740 --> 53:32.500
where it meets the main road, and seven cars backed up waiting for them to move.

53:32.500 --> 53:34.500
You couldn't even go around them because of the median.

53:35.140 --> 53:38.740
I've yet to be trapped by them, but I don't know its only amount of time until they make

53:38.740 --> 53:39.860
me late for work.

53:39.860 --> 53:43.300
What can I do to get rid of these geese without hurting them?

53:43.860 --> 53:46.020
That's from my Gooses Cooked in Massachusetts.

53:47.140 --> 53:52.100
I guess what we're dealing with here is life finds a way.

53:52.100 --> 53:53.060
Okay, sure.

53:53.060 --> 53:54.020
All right, I'll allow it.

53:54.020 --> 53:55.220
Go on.

53:55.220 --> 54:04.340
We tried to take the land from the geese, and now the geese are taking the land back.

54:04.340 --> 54:05.060
It's not bad.

54:05.060 --> 54:13.460
I mean, man creates goose, goose delays man, god kills man, goose kills god.

54:14.660 --> 54:15.380
Eats god.

54:15.940 --> 54:18.740
Goose eats god, women rule the world.

54:21.700 --> 54:22.900
Food for thought.

54:22.900 --> 54:27.460
Hey, hey, is it possible the insurance company you work for is Aflac?

54:29.620 --> 54:35.780
These geese are here by design because the Aflac duck needs to fuck, and so they bring in-

54:35.780 --> 54:39.060
And as we all know, ducks love to fuck geese.

54:40.100 --> 54:43.380
And that is also Aflac's second motto.

54:43.380 --> 54:48.100
It's the Aflac motto is 15% or more of 15 or whatever.

54:48.100 --> 54:50.020
No, that's Geico, but they have a motto.

54:50.020 --> 54:53.380
The other one is the Aflac duck gots to fuck.

54:54.020 --> 55:00.260
The Aflac duck, a cross-species breeder that is an abject horror to god himself.

55:01.060 --> 55:02.500
A duck and a goose.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.340
A goose is just a pretty duck.

55:04.340 --> 55:04.900
I don't know why-

55:04.900 --> 55:09.940
It would make Griffin, it would make a guck, and I'm not a fan of this portmanteau.

55:11.140 --> 55:11.460
No.

55:12.100 --> 55:12.900
Or a deuce.

55:13.540 --> 55:14.420
It's not good either.

55:14.420 --> 55:15.060
Deuce guck.

55:15.060 --> 55:18.420
Deuce guck, male gigolo.

55:22.420 --> 55:23.620
You monster!

55:24.340 --> 55:25.220
Deuce guck.

55:25.220 --> 55:31.540
Rob is back, and this time he's playing a half duck, half goose monstrous hybrid who is here

55:31.540 --> 55:32.660
for your sexual needs.

55:32.660 --> 55:35.380
He's deuce guck, guck gigolo.

55:36.500 --> 55:41.140
I just think that if that happens, you've got a bill-

55:41.140 --> 55:44.420
Okay, let's not get rid of the geese, all right?

55:44.420 --> 55:45.060
Yeah.

55:45.060 --> 55:49.380
Let's leave the geese and then be late for work whenever the fuck you want to.

55:49.380 --> 55:50.500
It's so good.

55:50.500 --> 55:51.620
It's so good.

55:51.620 --> 55:55.860
Like you could just plan on leaving your house like 15 minutes late and there's like the geese.

55:55.860 --> 55:56.740
The geese again.

55:57.780 --> 56:04.980
And then eventually they'll round up all the geese and they'll send them to a real nice

56:04.980 --> 56:06.420
geese farm upstate.

56:06.420 --> 56:08.900
Real nice, fellow employees.

56:09.860 --> 56:10.820
No, Justin, you're suggesting-

56:10.820 --> 56:11.780
Real nice.

56:11.780 --> 56:17.460
Yeah, you're suggesting that these people who are going to send them upstate are somehow

56:17.460 --> 56:20.580
able to collect all geese.

56:20.580 --> 56:26.180
I'm saying that if it starts cutting into employee productivity, corporate America will

56:26.180 --> 56:28.980
find a way to evict these geese to hell.

56:29.540 --> 56:32.420
That's kind of what I think, is that they'll probably kill all the geese.

56:32.420 --> 56:34.420
That's what I'm saying is it'll kill all the geese.

56:34.420 --> 56:38.340
So there is, I think there's an unlimited number of times you can use this excuse would

56:38.340 --> 56:38.980
be my concern.

56:38.980 --> 56:43.860
I feel like Dilbert got weird when it was then more about sort of them killing geese.

56:43.860 --> 56:47.620
But I think sort of following Scott's sort of arc.

56:47.620 --> 56:54.340
His journey through this life and the sort of unorthodox path that he's decided to carve

56:54.340 --> 56:54.900
through it.

56:55.620 --> 56:57.220
I think it makes a lot of sense.

56:58.100 --> 56:59.540
Oh, Scott.

57:00.020 --> 57:02.260
Oh, Scott, you've done it again.

57:02.260 --> 57:04.340
You made us talk about you, Scott.

57:04.340 --> 57:06.340
You did it again, Scotty.

57:06.340 --> 57:09.140
This Jumbotron from Scott.

57:10.340 --> 57:11.780
Hey, do you guys want a quick Yahoo?

57:12.980 --> 57:13.540
Yeah.

57:13.540 --> 57:14.100
How quick?

57:14.980 --> 57:20.340
This one was sent in by level 9000 YajruDruid, Drew Davenport.

57:20.340 --> 57:20.900
Thank you, Drew.

57:20.900 --> 57:27.300
It's Yajru Answers User Greatest, who asks, why do people with baguettes think they are

57:27.300 --> 57:27.940
better than me?

57:29.700 --> 57:34.980
I was at the local grocery store asking where I could find a good meat to go on a charcuterie.

57:34.980 --> 57:41.300
And not one, but two people holding baguettes told me you seem like a deli ham kind of person.

57:41.940 --> 57:45.540
They seemed like they were talking down on me and I just wanted to know why baguettes

57:45.540 --> 57:46.820
make people mean.

57:46.820 --> 57:49.220
I don't believe this.

57:49.860 --> 57:55.860
I don't believe that anyone ever told anybody you look like a deli ham person.

57:56.660 --> 57:57.300
No, no, no.

57:57.300 --> 57:59.220
I guarantee here's what happened.

57:59.220 --> 58:01.300
Hey, where do I find meat for charcuterie?

58:01.300 --> 58:02.820
Oh, you should check out the deli.

58:02.820 --> 58:06.340
Oh, I'm a deli meat kind of person?

58:06.340 --> 58:12.340
Even if that, or this person said, where can I find meat for like a char-der-er-poo-dee?

58:12.340 --> 58:15.700
And it was like, maybe you should stick with bologna.

58:15.700 --> 58:16.500
That's what it was.

58:16.500 --> 58:20.980
These baguette havers, they heard you say, yeah, I'm looking for some good meats for

58:20.980 --> 58:22.180
charcuterie.

58:22.180 --> 58:27.300
And they're like, oh, babe, oh, sweetheart, you are not prepared for it.

58:27.300 --> 58:28.260
You're going to get hurt.

58:28.260 --> 58:29.060
You're going to hurt yourself.

58:29.060 --> 58:29.700
Yeah.

58:29.700 --> 58:30.100
Because some of these-

58:30.100 --> 58:31.860
We talked about charcuterie before on this show.

58:31.860 --> 58:32.820
You couldn't handle that.

58:32.820 --> 58:33.700
You can handle it.

58:33.700 --> 58:37.700
Some of those, they call it sharp cheddar for a reason.

58:37.700 --> 58:39.060
You don't even know where to look.

58:39.060 --> 58:42.180
Where are you going to find the honeycomb, the raw honeycomb?

58:42.740 --> 58:43.620
You don't.

58:43.620 --> 58:44.580
You can't.

58:44.580 --> 58:45.940
Get a Lunchable.

58:45.940 --> 58:46.580
Start there.

58:47.780 --> 58:50.980
A Lunchable is like, that's right.

58:50.980 --> 58:52.980
It's like a training charcuterie.

58:52.980 --> 58:53.700
Yeah.

58:53.700 --> 58:55.060
It's charcuterie junior.

58:55.940 --> 58:56.980
New from Hasbro.

58:57.620 --> 58:58.820
It is charcuterie.

58:58.820 --> 59:00.100
They should start calling it that.

59:00.100 --> 59:02.260
I bet you'd rope in some dumb people.

59:02.980 --> 59:03.300
Yeah.

59:03.300 --> 59:05.220
You could get charcuterie junior.

59:06.740 --> 59:08.020
Charcuterie.

59:08.020 --> 59:09.060
There it is.

59:09.060 --> 59:09.540
There it is.

59:09.540 --> 59:10.740
I was scraping for it.

59:10.740 --> 59:11.460
You found it.

59:12.100 --> 59:16.500
And you could do it like those bad Chevy commercials where you get a bunch of people sitting at

59:16.500 --> 59:19.940
a table and maybe they're professional chefs, some of the best chefs in the country.

59:19.940 --> 59:22.180
I'm talking about real Emeril Lagasse types.

59:22.180 --> 59:22.660
Sure.

59:22.660 --> 59:28.100
And they're sitting there at the table and you say, here, let's have some charcuterie

59:28.100 --> 59:32.740
while you wait and they eat it and then Emeril's like, hey, this is pretty good charcuterie.

59:32.740 --> 59:36.980
And you pull it off and it's been Lunchables and he'll never work in this town again.

59:37.860 --> 59:38.980
That'll teach him.

59:38.980 --> 59:41.620
That'll teach him for fucking kicking it up so much.

59:43.620 --> 59:46.580
There's a reason the rest of us aren't kicking it up all the time.

59:46.580 --> 59:49.300
Emeril, and now it's time for you to pay the piper.

59:49.300 --> 59:52.340
You've been embarrassed by my Lunchables commercial.

59:54.100 --> 59:54.580
Got you.

59:54.580 --> 59:58.260
Well, folks, that's going to do it for us.

59:58.260 --> 01:00:01.700
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.020
We hope you have enjoyed yourself very much.

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:07.220
We want to say a huge thank you to Bridget Lancaster.

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:13.700
You can watch her on America's Test Kitchen or you can download and listen to Proof,

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.060
a podcast from America's Test Kitchen.

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:21.940
I would highly recommend all episodes, but the ones about Bean Boozled.

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:26.740
There's a two-parter about how they get the weird flavors in Bean Boozled Jelly Bellies.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:30.180
It is utterly fascinating that you should listen to.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:34.420
And we're very grateful to her for appearing on the program.

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:38.740
We also want to say we are going to be at PodCon.

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:38.980
Yes.

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.060
That is coming up.

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.380
It's January 19th and 20th.

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:48.020
And so if you're in the Seattle area and you want to come, you can grab tickets at podcon.com.

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:53.220
But there's also a remote attendance option where a little bit after the event,

01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:57.300
you can basically get recordings of all of the panels, performances,

01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.220
and live recordings from PodCon 2.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:04.100
So even if you can't make it, you can still hear all the stuff that's discussed there.

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.780
Go to podcon.com.

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.020
Also, go check out McElroy.family.

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:13.540
There's a lot of cool stuff on there, but also there's a link to our live shows.

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:19.460
And you can get your tickets for our upcoming Birmingham, Alabama, and New Orleans, Louisiana

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:25.300
shows that's coming up February 8th, 10th, and 11th, if I remember correctly.

01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:31.460
So go check that out, McElroy.family, as well as everything else we do.

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:31.700
Yep.

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:34.980
I think that pretty much covers it, right?

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:38.900
Thanks to John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.900
Off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.340
It's a great album, great song.

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:44.820
We're very fortunate that we are able to use it.

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:48.020
Check out the other Max Fun shows.

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.260
JV Club.

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:55.940
Rachel was on an episode this week, or I guess last week by the time you listened to this.

01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:56.980
That's cool.

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:59.860
My wife!

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:04.180
And yes, so that's very exciting.

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.620
I can't wait to dip into that.

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.700
It just came out right before we started recording.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.140
So yeah.

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:10.180
And y'all want that final?

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:10.580
Heck yeah.

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.100
Sure do.

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:12.740
Here it goes.

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:17.060
This final Yahoo was sent in by Jeff Mock.

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:17.700
Thanks, Jeff.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.580
It's Yahoo Answers user, Lana K, who asks,

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:27.060
is it possible to be blowed out a whale's blowhole and life?
