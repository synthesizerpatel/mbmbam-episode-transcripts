00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.240
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, the advice show for the modern era.

00:48.240 --> 00:53.440
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.440 --> 00:56.320
Oh no, I'm Griffin McElroy. Travis, what's the matter, partner?

00:56.320 --> 01:03.920
What's wrong? I didn't get the call, you know? Today, when we're recording this,

01:04.960 --> 01:10.640
it's the first official game of the NFL 2020 season.

01:10.640 --> 01:14.480
Oh no. Once again, I didn't make the cut.

01:15.360 --> 01:21.840
Oh no. You've been practicing so hard.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.800
Yeah, but I don't get to feel up the pigskin.

01:24.800 --> 01:31.360
You can't fondle the pig, and you got the tire in the backyard that you throw the football through.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.800
I flip the tire, and then I throw the football through it.

01:34.800 --> 01:41.120
And then you just stomp through it. Most of your practice is tire-based.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.960
I remember when me and Justin and you were playing out in the field,

01:44.960 --> 01:48.800
and you found that tire, and you picked it up, and you said, now I can play football.

01:49.520 --> 01:53.440
Well, it was a magical tire, or else what was it doing in that field? You know what I mean?

01:53.440 --> 01:55.600
Like, there wasn't a car for miles.

01:55.600 --> 01:59.360
We were confused when you said, this tire is the key to football.

02:00.400 --> 02:05.600
But then we watched you practice with it. You worked so hard. Your body looks so crazy.

02:06.240 --> 02:11.360
And I didn't get the call. I didn't get the call.

02:11.360 --> 02:15.360
And so another season. And I thought this year, you know,

02:15.360 --> 02:20.080
is like COVID-19's out there, and so maybe they'll need more people.

02:20.080 --> 02:26.960
Yeah, maybe it'll be like that situation where that one bartender from Philadelphia,

02:26.960 --> 02:32.000
and they were like, hey, you come play for us. But nobody called me.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.320
That movie's wild. Because it's like,

02:35.360 --> 02:40.480
if this fucking dude could play football, why not Travis with his magic tire?

02:40.480 --> 02:44.400
Right. I didn't get the call. I waited. I waited by the phone.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.960
Every day, I even drafted myself to my ding-dang fantasy football league,

02:48.960 --> 02:50.720
and now I look like a total tit.

02:50.720 --> 02:55.760
Yeah, you're probably not going to get many points off your own sweaty, your brow.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.800
Trav, I'm sorry.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.640
They won't let me write in my points.

02:58.640 --> 03:02.320
Say like, well, today I played touch football, and I scored three touchdowns.

03:02.320 --> 03:03.520
So that's 21 points.

03:03.520 --> 03:04.880
This should have been your year, though.

03:04.880 --> 03:05.680
It should have been.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.080
If not this year, you know?

03:08.080 --> 03:10.000
No one's even going to be watching, you know what I mean?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.720
Because like, they can't go to the stadium.

03:12.720 --> 03:13.120
No.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.200
Right? And so you would think that they would be like,

03:15.200 --> 03:17.280
let's try some weird stuff this year.

03:17.280 --> 03:21.280
This would be the year for like a donkey that kicks field goals, right?

03:21.280 --> 03:22.720
If they're ever going to do it.

03:24.480 --> 03:24.720
Yeah.

03:25.680 --> 03:29.120
Or Tony Danza, the incredible field goal kicking garbage man.

03:29.120 --> 03:29.920
What is that?

03:29.920 --> 03:30.720
I think you nailed that.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.240
I think that's what you're talking about.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.600
I mean, baseball is having fun with that.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.960
I don't know if you guys have been keeping track.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.600
I'm not one to follow the sports news, but I did see a story today

03:39.600 --> 03:44.720
that the Atlanta Braves won a game yesterday with a big 29 runs.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.880
So it feels kind of like they were just like,

03:46.880 --> 03:49.120
guys, let's just have fucking fun.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.080
This doesn't count.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.440
None of this counts.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.800
Let's just have fun with it.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.840
Why don't you throw a few slow boys down the plate?

03:55.840 --> 03:59.600
Let me get a few grand salamis and next game I'll let you do it

03:59.600 --> 04:02.320
because none of this fucking counts or matters.

04:02.320 --> 04:06.480
It has just occurred to me that there was never an equivalent

04:06.480 --> 04:09.440
of like rookie of the year, but for like the NFL,

04:09.440 --> 04:12.400
where it's like, hey, that nine year old threw that football pretty good.

04:12.400 --> 04:16.160
Get him in here with all these like 400 pound men.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.440
Or I mean, in the NFL version of rookie of the year, he would be huge.

04:19.440 --> 04:24.160
Like, and that would be his thing is that he would be like a linebacker

04:24.160 --> 04:25.520
and he would be the Hulk.

04:25.520 --> 04:26.160
He would be-

04:26.160 --> 04:27.360
But he's like 10.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.320
But he's 10 years.

04:28.320 --> 04:33.040
He's a 400 pound, 10 year old, just monster, absolute unit of a lad.

04:34.400 --> 04:39.680
The garbage picking, field goal kicking, Philadelphia phenomenon

04:39.680 --> 04:43.040
is the full name of the film starring Tony Danza

04:43.040 --> 04:44.880
as a garbage man that is good at football.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.560
And that's gotta have great SEO.

04:46.560 --> 04:47.280
You know what I mean?

04:47.280 --> 04:50.000
So easy to remember, clear to search for.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.600
Was the story of that movie,

04:51.600 --> 04:58.560
can you believe this professional sanitation worker can also be an athlete?

04:59.280 --> 05:02.800
They give an average guy a shot at the NFL.

05:03.440 --> 05:03.760
Why?

05:03.760 --> 05:04.800
And they make him the kick.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.480
Well, cause he's the kicker, so who cares?

05:06.480 --> 05:09.440
No, but I mean, even then, was it just like, hey, that guy,

05:09.440 --> 05:12.240
let's see if he can do it or was there a contest?

05:12.240 --> 05:17.600
I have like vaguest fucking fragment of a memory

05:17.600 --> 05:21.520
of him kicking like water bottles really far.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.760
And they're like, yes, this translates.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.200
Yes, you are the guy.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.160
Half of the players in the real life NFL

05:28.160 --> 05:31.920
is because somebody saw them like throwing fish at the fish market

05:31.920 --> 05:33.600
or like tackling a bear.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.920
And they say, yeah, that guy's very good at tackling.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.640
Scouts will sometimes just go to the tire store

05:38.640 --> 05:42.080
and watch how people shelf tires and move tires around.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.600
And they're like, that's football, baby.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.560
The end of that film,

05:46.560 --> 05:49.120
I pulled up the Wikipedia page to get the right name.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.000
At the end of that film,

05:50.560 --> 05:53.920
the holder of the football fumbles the snap

05:54.480 --> 05:58.640
and Tony Danza grabs it and scores the game winning touchdown.

05:58.640 --> 06:03.680
So even the creators of the garbage picking field goal kicking

06:03.680 --> 06:08.880
Philadelphia phenomena agree that a kick is too boring of a way to end.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.720
It's just not interesting enough.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.240
It has to be a touchdown.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.920
You can't just make it a good kick.

06:13.920 --> 06:14.640
That's nothing.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.200
I mean, I would, I disagree

06:17.200 --> 06:19.280
because I would watch a game that's just kicks.

06:19.280 --> 06:23.040
That's just kicking back and just field goal after just a shootout.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.320
Soccer.

06:24.320 --> 06:24.800
Oh, fuck.

06:24.800 --> 06:25.440
Wait, what now?

06:26.400 --> 06:28.160
But the ball would be super silly.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.080
Like they wouldn't, that's what I love about the American.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.520
Put a little water in it.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.480
The European football is like spherical

06:34.480 --> 06:38.000
in a way that is sort of like geometrically pleasing to some.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.240
But I love the way that when American football hit the ground,

06:40.240 --> 06:41.600
it's like, good luck fuckers.

06:46.240 --> 06:50.240
I want more weird balls in sport and by which I'm,

06:50.240 --> 06:52.880
but when I say that, I don't really want it that bad.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.800
I really feel like in order for sport to move me these days,

06:56.800 --> 07:02.080
you need to score 29 big, big runs in a single game.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.360
Cause that, fuck yeah.

07:03.360 --> 07:08.000
Now we're playing some like broken, you know, MLB 2K on the dreamcast.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.880
It's transformed into Blaseball.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.880
If I may, here's what I think would really,

07:14.000 --> 07:18.320
if I might fix football in 2020 to get more people watching.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.000
Cosmic football.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.240
A lot more like, you know, after hours bowling alley

07:24.240 --> 07:28.080
where everything's like, you know, black light and like neon.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.440
And like, maybe you play some like, especially funky music,

07:31.440 --> 07:34.240
PG-13 music, if you will, Cupid Shuffle,

07:34.240 --> 07:36.320
where you're not sure where the sexual part is,

07:36.320 --> 07:37.600
but it sounds pretty good.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.160
It sounds good.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.600
And that's great, Trav.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.800
Say, is part of your plan also maybe make the field a little bit shorter?

07:42.800 --> 07:45.360
Maybe get rid of some of the penalties

07:45.360 --> 07:48.320
and then maybe have a sort of strict opinion

07:48.320 --> 07:52.720
about political demonstrations on the field there, Vince McMahon, or?

07:54.160 --> 07:58.640
Wait, in XFL, is there like the ball is black light?

07:59.280 --> 08:00.240
Yeah, yeah, it is.

08:00.800 --> 08:01.840
Aw, no.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.560
Well, it's so you can make sure everybody did wash their hands.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.440
For safety.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.240
It's for safety.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.120
Oh, but you like, all the uniforms are black, right?

08:09.120 --> 08:13.920
But, but you put some like neon reflective tape on

08:13.920 --> 08:16.000
to make them look like stick men running around?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.520
Oh, or skeletons.

08:17.520 --> 08:18.000
Oh, shit.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.760
Oh, yeah, for the Halloween season.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.800
You can dress up.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.800
You can do your own costume.

08:23.920 --> 08:24.720
That's cool.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.200
That would be like when we played mascot football.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.240
When I was, I played mascot football

08:30.240 --> 08:33.360
at a River City Locomotives indoor arena football game,

08:33.360 --> 08:36.640
and I was cowabunga, the cow for WTCR,

08:36.640 --> 08:38.160
and I went out there on that beautiful field,

08:38.160 --> 08:39.920
and it was my crowning achievement

08:39.920 --> 08:42.480
because I did run in a beautiful touchdown,

08:42.480 --> 08:43.680
but I only accomplished it

08:43.680 --> 08:45.200
because Louie the lightning bug

08:45.200 --> 08:47.680
sacked the fucking shit out of Shoney Bear

08:47.680 --> 08:51.520
and sent her forehead flying 10 yards down the field.

08:51.520 --> 08:52.000
It was-

08:52.000 --> 08:53.360
I've been in that cow costume.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.800
Visibility is low.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.840
It is limited.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.040
It was an incredible catch.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.920
It was, it'll be the end of my movie.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.160
Nothing I've done after that is gonna be better,

09:02.160 --> 09:03.600
but it's also going to be the start

09:03.600 --> 09:05.040
of Louie the lightning bug's movie

09:05.040 --> 09:08.480
because he really made Shoney Bear eat fucking mud.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.200
There's a scout who's like,

09:11.200 --> 09:12.800
give me that lightning bug.

09:12.800 --> 09:13.920
He tackles good,

09:13.920 --> 09:16.640
but then he can only tackle in the lightning bug costume.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.560
You gotta play it safe around me.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.240
Is Louie the lightning bug a universal reference

09:24.240 --> 09:25.520
or a local reference?

09:25.520 --> 09:26.480
We'll find out, won't we?

09:26.480 --> 09:27.280
Should we do a question?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.200
I'd love that.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.160
Thank you so much.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.440
Thank you so much.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.000
Sorry, I'm really excited about all the good Munch Squad

09:34.000 --> 09:35.040
I have this episode.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.040
I feel like I've been seeing a lot of Munch Squad

09:37.040 --> 09:37.760
in the ether.

09:37.760 --> 09:38.800
I feel like people are getting-

09:38.800 --> 09:40.560
They've all just been saved up in the pipe.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.320
There's been a big clog.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.720
It's so, I almost don't wanna,

09:44.720 --> 09:45.600
oh wait, oh wait.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.360
No, no, you can't do that.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.960
Yeah, you can't Munch Squad for some reason.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.320
Just rip it, baby.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.120
Give me question number two.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.560
I'll do a couple throughout the show.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.280
Can we do that?

09:53.280 --> 09:54.400
Can we just do a couple throughout the show?

09:54.400 --> 09:56.080
Okay, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

09:56.080 --> 09:56.580
Munch.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.320
Okay, Munch Squad.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.360
It's podcast within podcast.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.960
Profiling the latest and greatest of brand eating.

10:00.960 --> 10:04.480
There's just so much going on that I need to talk about.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.160
You guys hear about the Candyman?

10:06.160 --> 10:06.660
What?

10:07.040 --> 10:07.760
Don't say it again.

10:09.120 --> 10:12.880
Candyman is David Klein.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.280
He is the creator of the Jelly Belly.

10:15.280 --> 10:15.600
Okay.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.560
Oh, I heard about this.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.400
So he, not Jelly Belly's themselves,

10:21.520 --> 10:23.840
but the creator of the Jelly Belly

10:23.840 --> 10:25.360
who kind of struck out on his own

10:25.360 --> 10:27.200
after I assume selling the brand

10:27.200 --> 10:29.840
for a lot of money.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.160
The Candyman is doing-

10:32.160 --> 10:33.760
Ah, you said it three times.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.120
Okay, I knew you were just,

10:35.120 --> 10:36.400
I wanted to get it out of the way.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.760
So I beat you to it.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.400
So he is doing a Willy Wonka style

10:45.600 --> 10:48.080
Jelly Belly, a Willy Wonka style treasure hunt

10:48.880 --> 10:51.840
where he is going to give away a candy factory

10:51.840 --> 10:58.160
if you find the golden tickets that he has hidden around.

10:58.160 --> 10:58.480
Okay.

10:58.480 --> 11:02.400
He couldn't even like take it and turn it and twist it.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.440
He just said like,

11:03.440 --> 11:05.440
like he watches like Willy Wonka with his kids

11:05.440 --> 11:07.040
and said, ah, fuck it.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.200
And he's just gonna like copy and paste

11:09.200 --> 11:10.240
Willy Wonka's whole deal?

11:10.240 --> 11:13.040
No, no, Travis, he's not.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.920
He's gonna mix it up quite a bit.

11:16.640 --> 11:20.800
There is a gold ticket hidden in one in each state

11:20.800 --> 11:22.080
as I understand it.

11:22.080 --> 11:22.560
Yeah.

11:22.560 --> 11:25.520
I will now tell you the particulars of this contest.

11:26.800 --> 11:30.640
And this is, I'm reading directly from thegoldticket.com.

11:30.640 --> 11:31.200
How to play.

11:31.760 --> 11:34.080
Each treasure hunt game will have a game location

11:34.080 --> 11:37.440
and a start date and cost $49.98 to play.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.800
And then it says, this is the cost for the riddle.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.840
This is the cost for the riddle?

11:43.840 --> 11:45.600
This is the, it says in parentheticals,

11:45.600 --> 11:47.360
this is the cost for the riddle.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.200
The registered person who purchased the game

11:56.160 --> 11:58.080
you will receive the riddle in your group.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.240
You will be looking for a gold ticket

12:00.240 --> 12:02.400
in the form of a necklace with a tag

12:02.400 --> 12:05.360
that includes a code you need to verify your find.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.880
Winners will receive $5,000.

12:08.240 --> 12:10.240
Gold ticket codes must be submitted to,

12:10.960 --> 12:11.840
this is the email address.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.560
All treasure hunt players will be eligible

12:14.560 --> 12:16.880
to join in on the ultimate treasure hunt

12:16.880 --> 12:19.520
where I give away one of my candy factories.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.560
Okay, but, okay, in real life though,

12:22.560 --> 12:24.160
getting that candy factory means

12:24.160 --> 12:26.560
now you have employees to worry about

12:26.560 --> 12:30.800
and like payroll taxes and like fucking workman's comp

12:30.800 --> 12:32.000
and OSHA and shit.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.280
It's not like, yes, let's fold this river of chocolates.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.840
Oh, yes, I have that, everything's eatable.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.600
I think OSHA gives a little bit of just a,

12:41.600 --> 12:46.000
it gives a bit of clearance to candy factories.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.880
If Willy Wonka's film is to be believed.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.080
I think OSHA is like,

12:50.080 --> 12:52.320
they're doing something wonderful and whimsical over there.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.800
Let's just let them do what they need to do

12:54.800 --> 12:56.000
to make these jelly beans.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.360
Yeah, I mean, assuming, sorry,

12:59.360 --> 13:00.400
I got a little bit distracted

13:00.400 --> 13:03.040
because I was absolutely paying the $50

13:03.040 --> 13:05.200
I need to get in on this incredible treasure hunt.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.000
West Virginia, you could-

13:06.000 --> 13:06.880
Guys, don't get it twisted.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.360
$50 is the cost for the riddle, okay?

13:11.120 --> 13:12.320
So I'm pretty excited.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.840
You could take this for West Virginia.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.960
That's what I feel like.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.200
I feel like I've got a pretty good shot here.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.280
What's stopping you from paying the $50,

13:21.280 --> 13:22.080
getting the riddle,

13:22.080 --> 13:23.920
and then just blasting that out

13:23.920 --> 13:26.400
to our millions and millions and millions of listeners?

13:28.240 --> 13:29.200
Oh, that's a good idea.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.520
Cause I paid the cost for the riddle.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.600
Right, that's not the, no prize to enter

13:35.600 --> 13:36.800
or like, you know what I mean?

13:36.800 --> 13:38.080
Like anyone can enter,

13:38.080 --> 13:40.240
but if you want the riddle, you pay $49.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.360
I'm assuming that you have to pay the $49.98

13:43.360 --> 13:44.400
to get the riddle,

13:44.400 --> 13:46.320
but I'm not going to give the riddle away for free.

13:46.320 --> 13:47.600
I wouldn't do the Candyman like that.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.760
He and I are going to be working in very close concert

13:50.640 --> 13:53.680
when I start doing the candy factory

13:54.240 --> 13:56.000
the way I want to do it.

13:56.000 --> 13:56.560
If you know what I mean?

13:56.560 --> 13:58.880
What kind of big changes do you got planned, Justin,

13:58.880 --> 14:01.280
for the Jelly Belly brand?

14:02.000 --> 14:02.640
It's okay.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.080
I can't stress this enough.

14:04.080 --> 14:07.040
This is in no way connected to the Jelly Belly brand.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.360
Candyman is a different guy.

14:09.360 --> 14:10.960
He sold Jelly Belly.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.080
He sold Jelly Belly.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.920
Jelly Belly has no, there's going to be people

14:13.920 --> 14:15.120
walking up to a factory like,

14:15.120 --> 14:16.160
I'll take this one.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.400
No, we're not doing, that's not the thing.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.800
So what does he produce in his mini factories?

14:21.360 --> 14:24.960
Do you want me to list the products of CandymanKitchens.com?

14:24.960 --> 14:27.600
There's crime scene candy and blood and cloth.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.560
Ew, God.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.480
That's one, that's one that you can get.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.400
You know what, just leave it there, J-Man,

14:32.400 --> 14:35.440
because now I want to win so I can shut it down.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.440
Shut it all down.

14:37.440 --> 14:40.560
Make this stuff ethically, do it different.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.840
I believe in farm to table blood clot candy.

14:43.840 --> 14:44.400
Here's a quote.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.920
The world needs this right now.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.760
We have received thousands of comments from people who say

14:51.760 --> 14:53.360
this has come at such a perfect time.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.240
We've received thousands of comments of like,

14:56.240 --> 14:58.640
please give me candy factory, I need this.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.600
I was just thinking about how if somebody did a Willy Wonka,

15:01.600 --> 15:03.440
it would really start fixing shit.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.520
Yeah, that would fix it all.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.920
So I'm so excited about that.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.400
I will keep you guys abreast of my progress.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.120
Okay.

15:11.120 --> 15:14.000
This will be the greatest Riddle Me Piss of our generation.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.720
And maybe the last one so that the stakes are very high.

15:18.000 --> 15:18.560
Yeah.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.720
If I win, you can't do Riddle Me Piss anymore.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.400
And if you win, I assume you're retiring

15:22.400 --> 15:23.520
from My Brother, My Brother and Me.

15:23.520 --> 15:24.560
Oh, the show's done.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.760
The show's done.

15:25.760 --> 15:26.720
Oh, the show's over, yeah.

15:26.720 --> 15:27.680
I have a candy factory.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.880
It'll be Justin's candy factory,

15:28.880 --> 15:31.280
but I'm assuming you will let us sort of,

15:31.280 --> 15:33.760
you know, join the board at least and we can sort of-

15:33.760 --> 15:36.080
Oh yeah, yeah, you'll be on the board for sure.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.000
I need to get my wisdom teeth out soon

15:38.000 --> 15:40.400
and I'm looking to sell them to an artist.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.840
I'm really tight on money right now.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.480
And as an artist, I love supporting other artists.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.400
The issue is I don't know how to find

15:46.400 --> 15:48.080
any artists looking for teeth.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.160
I looked everywhere and no one is buying.

15:50.160 --> 15:51.840
How much should I sell them for?

15:51.840 --> 15:54.240
How can I sell my teeth so I can eat

15:54.240 --> 15:55.680
through a straw for a while?

15:55.680 --> 15:59.360
That's from Strap for Cash in St. Paul, Minnesota.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.400
Or Minneapolis, Minnesota.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.240
Minneapolis is a city in the-

16:04.240 --> 16:05.760
There's so much going on in this question.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.200
I don't get out of the house anymore.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.920
I've been to this place and it's but a faint memory.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.360
There's so much going on.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.280
My favorite thing about this question,

16:13.280 --> 16:14.720
what makes me love this question

16:14.720 --> 16:16.960
is that you question asker were like,

16:16.960 --> 16:18.960
and so I'm gonna sell them to an artist.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.240
Don't get it twisted.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.840
No artists are buying them.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.880
So this is a wholly created scenario.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.440
I'm gonna search Craigslist for teeth.

16:28.000 --> 16:28.560
Okay.

16:28.560 --> 16:33.440
There's 287 results for teeth.

16:33.440 --> 16:38.960
I'm gonna check eBay for human teeth.

16:38.960 --> 16:39.520
Yeah, I should have-

16:39.520 --> 16:40.800
I don't wanna just make something up.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.320
I should have been more specific.

16:42.320 --> 16:42.800
Well, here's-

16:43.520 --> 16:44.480
I got a lot of-

16:44.480 --> 16:45.440
Okay, okay.

16:45.440 --> 16:45.760
All right.

16:45.760 --> 16:48.160
Let's all explain sort of what we found.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.600
Okay, have you found prices?

16:49.600 --> 16:50.960
Travis, you're not looking at prices, right?

16:50.960 --> 16:51.520
No, I'm not.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.440
Okay, let's say 20 teeth.

16:53.440 --> 16:53.760
Okay.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.520
What would you-

16:55.520 --> 16:57.440
What do you think the going set is on that?

16:57.440 --> 16:58.160
20 teeth?

16:59.040 --> 17:01.200
Are these adult teeth or baby teeth?

17:01.200 --> 17:02.000
These are a lot.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.440
I'm looking at the very first result.

17:04.880 --> 17:05.280
How many-

17:05.280 --> 17:08.320
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.320
It does specify pre-owned.

17:19.360 --> 17:20.320
Oh, okay.

17:21.440 --> 17:21.760
Good.

17:23.920 --> 17:24.800
Okay, okay.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.400
Glad that mystery's cleared up.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.600
Okay, okay.

17:27.600 --> 17:29.280
Lot of human teeth.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.720
The very first result.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.240
Lot of human teeth.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.040
This is the new Haunted Town Watch.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.000
I'm just gonna talk about-

17:36.000 --> 17:37.760
Okay, lot of human teeth, 20 teeth.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.520
What are you gonna pay for these teeth?

17:39.520 --> 17:40.160
What do you think the-

17:40.160 --> 17:41.520
I'm gonna say 200.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.880
200 for the lot.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.240
Current bid is $50.

17:44.240 --> 17:44.740
Okay.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.880
Now, that's not a buy it now.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.480
There is a buy it now.

17:48.480 --> 17:55.520
I have eight fucking grotesque teeth that I'm looking at

17:55.520 --> 17:57.760
that you could buy for 35 bucks.

17:57.760 --> 18:01.440
They are vulgar and they make me want to throw up.

18:01.440 --> 18:02.400
Now, there's a really-

18:03.920 --> 18:07.520
This says nice set of human teeth for crafts.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.400
Hand selected 27 count.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.640
Intact crowns with some signs of minor decay

18:14.640 --> 18:17.120
and incomplete root formation to perfect.

18:17.760 --> 18:18.800
Perfect teeth.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.120
And now this is 27 perfect teeth.

18:21.120 --> 18:21.840
What are you gonna give me?

18:21.840 --> 18:23.360
For 27 perfect?

18:23.360 --> 18:24.160
Perfect teeth.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.040
There's a buy it now.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.840
Uh, I'm gonna say, okay, I was way off last time.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.840
I'm gonna say $100.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.080
Wow, $125.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.640
So that's where we're at price-wise.

18:34.640 --> 18:35.760
So let me just run the-

18:35.760 --> 18:38.720
Also, backdoor, welcome to my new pitch for a spinoff

18:38.720 --> 18:39.920
of Antiques Roadshow.

18:41.440 --> 18:42.640
I brought in my teeth.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.080
Oh, these are excellent.

18:44.080 --> 18:48.160
These are, this is colonial style.

18:48.160 --> 18:48.720
I love this.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.640
If we're doing four wisdom teeth,

18:51.440 --> 18:53.920
then at most, if we're using this,

18:53.920 --> 18:56.160
you're gonna be able to sell them for 18 and a half bucks,

18:56.160 --> 18:59.680
which ain't nothing, but it's also, I don't know,

18:59.680 --> 19:01.360
not a lot to pay rent or whatever.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.120
You gotta look at the market, right?

19:03.120 --> 19:04.160
Cause you gotta think,

19:04.800 --> 19:07.520
baby teeth are probably way down there, right?

19:07.520 --> 19:09.440
A lot of baby teeth floating around.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.320
Everybody's got them.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.640
You know, like you had them at some point,

19:12.640 --> 19:14.000
you lost them at some point.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.080
It is guaranteed that there will always be

19:16.080 --> 19:18.480
more and more baby teeth on the market.

19:18.480 --> 19:21.680
Then right after that has to be wisdom teeth, right?

19:21.680 --> 19:24.000
Like wisdom teeth is a thing that comes in

19:24.000 --> 19:25.600
and almost everybody gets their removed.

19:25.600 --> 19:29.280
You gotta think, top dollar is going for front adult teeth.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.520
Grown folks teeth, yeah.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.600
Yeah, like those front four.

19:33.600 --> 19:37.360
This reframes the popular holiday song,

19:37.360 --> 19:39.120
All I Want for Christmas is my two front teeth.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.280
And it's like, don't be so fucking,

19:41.280 --> 19:43.520
like I want a Nintendo 64 for Christmas.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.880
Like we don't always get the things that we want.

19:44.880 --> 19:48.160
That would be like $500 for two front,

19:48.160 --> 19:50.640
the best teeth are your two front teeth.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.840
Maybe incisors, I might give you incisors

19:53.840 --> 19:55.680
because incisors, you only got four of them.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.920
And they do a lot of the ripping and tearing work, right?

19:59.920 --> 20:01.920
Molars, that's all grinding, right?

20:01.920 --> 20:02.960
A lot of those that are in the back,

20:02.960 --> 20:04.320
you don't even see them as much.

20:04.320 --> 20:08.080
Incisors though, I feel like maybe those are the money teeth.

20:09.760 --> 20:10.400
It's hard to say.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.880
I've decided, I've just made a decision.

20:14.240 --> 20:18.240
I'm gonna set up, okay, yes, this will be good.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.320
I'm gonna set up a program.

20:20.320 --> 20:20.720
Oh boy.

20:22.320 --> 20:28.880
I, Justin McElroy, will buy the teeth for $100.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.800
Question asker, please give me your Venmo information.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.680
I will Venmo you the teeth for $100.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.000
This is an enormous breach of-

20:36.000 --> 20:36.720
$100.

20:36.720 --> 20:37.600
Power dynamics.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.000
I feel like-

20:38.000 --> 20:38.560
No, listen.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.560
Yeah, there's a condition coming, hold on.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.960
There's a part two, okay?

20:43.600 --> 20:47.920
If you are an artist, please email us

20:47.920 --> 20:50.400
with the subject line, I will use the teeth,

20:51.200 --> 20:54.960
and then tell us in as much detail as possible

20:55.600 --> 20:57.280
your plans for the teeth.

20:57.840 --> 20:58.320
Oh boy.

20:58.320 --> 21:01.440
We will then read some of these on the program

21:01.440 --> 21:04.160
and choose the best use of the teeth

21:04.160 --> 21:07.600
that we will then legally own and arrange shipping

21:07.600 --> 21:11.440
from the tooth holder to the artist.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.800
Now, I want to stress something.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.880
Me and Travis have nothing to do with this.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.680
Yes, one, legally Griffin and I are not a part of this.

21:19.680 --> 21:23.440
Two, anyone listening to this who's like,

21:23.440 --> 21:26.000
I'd sell my teeth, this is a one-time thing.

21:26.000 --> 21:26.960
It's a one-time deal.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.240
We're not going to set this show up

21:28.240 --> 21:30.560
as a black market tooth exchange.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.240
Just this one time, and if, listen,

21:32.880 --> 21:35.760
if you are not A, a legitimate artist,

21:35.760 --> 21:39.040
who B, does not have a legitimate use for these,

21:39.040 --> 21:40.960
because you know we're going to fight,

21:40.960 --> 21:43.680
we'll be all over you for pictures,

21:43.680 --> 21:46.960
descriptions by the moment, use of the teeth.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.440
I'm going to need all the details,

21:49.440 --> 21:51.760
so do not try to wade into this

21:51.760 --> 21:54.480
like you're just going to pick up teeth craft.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.120
I need a real artist who has a real great idea.

21:57.120 --> 22:02.160
Hey, are we sure that this is entirely legal?

22:02.160 --> 22:05.840
It doesn't feel so much legal to me.

22:05.840 --> 22:09.040
Because we're paying a human being for part of their body

22:09.040 --> 22:11.760
and then we're giving, yeah, no, correct.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.920
I'm sending $100 to a friend

22:13.920 --> 22:16.320
who will then be so inspired by my generosity

22:16.320 --> 22:18.400
that they're going to mail their teeth to a stranger.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.680
That's all that's happening here.

22:19.680 --> 22:23.200
Okay, so at no point are you going to touch these teeth?

22:23.200 --> 22:25.440
I can't stress this enough.

22:26.720 --> 22:30.800
I at no point want to see or possess these teeth.

22:30.800 --> 22:31.680
Until they are art.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.320
The deal is off.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.200
Until they're art.

22:34.800 --> 22:35.760
Until they're art.

22:35.760 --> 22:38.160
And then I double don't want them.

22:38.160 --> 22:41.040
Yeah, then you need to donate that shit to a museum.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.720
Then it belongs to a museum.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.360
So I don't want the teeth.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.600
I don't want to see the teeth until the art is.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.720
And then I still don't want them.

22:48.720 --> 22:50.160
Not in person, for sure.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.280
No, but this is a tooth patronage.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.720
Please follow up.

22:54.720 --> 22:58.320
Just reply to your first email with your payment information.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.880
I will buy the teeth on consignment.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.360
No, you will send them a gift of $100.

23:03.360 --> 23:07.200
I will send them a gift with the understanding

23:07.200 --> 23:11.600
that you will then send the teeth to a deserving artist

23:11.600 --> 23:15.280
who would just love those chompy little crows.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.040
And I swear to God, if somebody's like,

23:17.040 --> 23:18.960
I'm going to glue them to Mona Lisa.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.160
That's fucking funny.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.000
That would look funny.

23:22.000 --> 23:22.880
Stop it.

23:22.880 --> 23:23.760
Don't waste our time.

23:23.760 --> 23:26.880
You're keeping real artists who really need real teeth,

23:26.880 --> 23:30.000
real bad, from our awareness.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.760
So please don't do that.

23:31.760 --> 23:32.800
Here's, can I?

23:32.800 --> 23:37.440
Get that email address, by the way, it's mbnbam.maximumfun.org.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.680
And just make sure the subject line is,

23:39.680 --> 23:41.360
I will use the teeth in all casts.

23:41.360 --> 23:45.040
And hey, let's not make it weird, okay, everybody?

23:45.040 --> 23:46.880
Let's keep it pretty chill.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.960
Let's keep it cool and nice.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.120
Nothing weird with these teeth.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.040
What if it turns out there's a huge tooth demand, though?

23:55.040 --> 23:57.200
Oh, I thought you were going to say a huge tooth.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.720
You get the teeth in and it's like,

23:58.720 --> 24:00.080
whoa, what the fuck?

24:00.080 --> 24:01.360
This was a deep root.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.880
Can I do a Yahoo that was sent in by Yohannes?

24:05.680 --> 24:06.240
Yes.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.360
Okay, thank you, Yohannes.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.440
It's from an anonymous Yahoo answers user.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.320
I'm going to call Dr. Teeth, who asks,

24:13.360 --> 24:14.720
this question's so powerful.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.720
Which actors would have played Frasier

24:19.840 --> 24:24.320
if Frasier could regenerate like the Doctor on Doctor Who?

24:24.320 --> 24:25.760
Yes, yes.

24:25.760 --> 24:29.840
Yes, yes. Dr. Frasier is at an opera,

24:29.840 --> 24:33.920
chandelier, snap, falls from the ceiling, smashes him.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.600
Smashes him dead.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.120
The only way to kill Frasier.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.600
The only way that Frasier can be killed.

24:41.200 --> 24:46.000
And then everybody's like, oh no, Frasier, he's dead.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.760
But then he starts to glow.

24:48.480 --> 24:51.040
Kelsey Grammer turns into-

24:51.920 --> 24:52.880
John Lithgow.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.520
I was also thinking John Lithgow!

24:55.520 --> 24:55.920
Boom!

24:55.920 --> 24:57.520
Amazing, amazing.

24:58.080 --> 25:03.600
John Lithgow, a second chandelier, whoop, snap, right on Johnny boy.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.920
He starts to fucking glow again.

25:08.640 --> 25:11.440
This time he turns into Justin.

25:14.160 --> 25:15.120
He turns into Justin.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.840
No, it doesn't turn.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.040
I have to name an actor now.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.040
Yeah, you weren't already thinking of one?

25:23.040 --> 25:24.320
Come on, play the fucking game.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.600
Get your head in the game, boy.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.600
This is a game, boy.

25:28.480 --> 25:29.600
Daniel Radcliffe?

25:29.600 --> 25:30.240
No.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.840
No, Travis, you can't.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.200
No, we only yes on this show.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.200
Okay, I missed the question.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.280
I mean, you guys sound insane to me right now.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.440
Wait, you missed the question?

25:41.440 --> 25:42.480
You guys sound so wild.

25:42.480 --> 25:43.360
I just missed the question.

25:43.360 --> 25:46.960
Okay, Travis, don't tell him the question.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.800
Justin, I want more answers to the question.

25:50.880 --> 25:51.680
Okay.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.520
Daniel Radcliffe is crushed by-

25:53.520 --> 25:55.200
What have you heard so far, Justin?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.320
I heard John Lithgow and something about a chandelier.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.360
Okay, perfect.

25:59.360 --> 26:00.560
Do you know everything you need to know?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.320
Daniel Radcliffe is tragically smushed

26:02.320 --> 26:05.200
by a third, even bigger chandelier.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.360
His body starts to glow and he transforms into-

26:11.360 --> 26:12.160
Larry Bird?

26:12.160 --> 26:12.960
Oh.

26:12.960 --> 26:16.080
An interesting choice that I don't hate.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.760
Now that might seem like a stunt choice.

26:19.760 --> 26:22.320
But Larry Bird, I will say this,

26:22.320 --> 26:24.000
probably knows a lot about wine.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.080
I don't hate it, Juice.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.120
Wait, how does wine figure in-

26:27.120 --> 26:28.400
I don't hate it, Juice.

26:29.360 --> 26:30.240
How does wine figure in-

26:30.240 --> 26:31.280
You're never gonna believe this.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.080
Now, who would you-

26:32.080 --> 26:32.880
The first chandelier-

26:32.880 --> 26:35.360
Who would you partner with Larry Bird?

26:35.360 --> 26:38.640
No, because there's not two doctors on Doctor Who.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.320
No, but the doctor gets new companions.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.680
Okay, wait, so there's Doctor Who,

26:41.680 --> 26:43.120
there's wine is involved, okay.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.320
Okay, the first chandelier-

26:44.320 --> 26:46.160
Doctor Who gets new companions, though.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.200
That's true.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.640
The first chandelier-

26:48.640 --> 26:49.760
It's gotta be Jordan, by the way.

26:49.760 --> 26:50.640
I'd love to see the two of you.

26:50.640 --> 26:53.600
Oh, I could hang with that.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.680
The first chandelier zips back up to the ceiling

26:55.680 --> 26:57.840
and then falls on Larry Bird, tragically killing him,

26:57.840 --> 26:58.960
but his body starts to glow

26:58.960 --> 27:00.960
and then he transforms into Who next, Justin?

27:00.960 --> 27:02.640
Well, can I give you another point of data, Justin?

27:02.640 --> 27:03.360
What I was gonna say,

27:03.360 --> 27:04.240
maybe see if this will-

27:04.240 --> 27:05.920
Give me a hint, yeah.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.880
Richard Dreyfuss was what I was gonna say next.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.000
Richard Dreyfuss is a very,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.240
I will say this, Travis, a very dry choice.

27:12.240 --> 27:15.360
And I'm gonna squish him basically immediately.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.160
Okay, that's fair.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.920
Richard Dreyfuss transforms into Who next, Justin?

27:19.920 --> 27:26.160
In this classic role that is not Doctor Who.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.000
Aaliyah Shawkat.

27:28.640 --> 27:28.800
Huh.

27:28.800 --> 27:29.600
Holy shit.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.680
I'd watch the fuck out of that.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.760
Yeah, I mean, I've watched the fuck out of that.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.320
Would, okay, let me see if I can phrase this

27:36.320 --> 27:38.160
in a question that won't give it entirely away,

27:38.160 --> 27:41.360
is that would there be any dramatic changes

27:41.360 --> 27:44.000
to the personality of this classic character

27:44.000 --> 27:45.440
as played by Aaliyah Shawkat?

27:45.440 --> 27:49.840
Or are we just going straight down the middle?

27:51.040 --> 27:51.680
Shorter?

27:51.680 --> 27:52.880
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

27:57.200 --> 27:59.280
Urbane, probably more urbane.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.560
More urbane.

28:00.560 --> 28:01.360
Not possible.

28:03.280 --> 28:06.560
Okay, erudite?

28:06.560 --> 28:07.760
More erudite.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.200
More erudite.

28:09.200 --> 28:09.920
Holy shit.

28:09.920 --> 28:10.960
Wow, fucking-

28:10.960 --> 28:12.480
Wait, let me make sure that word means-

28:12.480 --> 28:13.760
It's gonna be off the charts.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.720
Oh man, I was trying to Google the definition for erudite

28:16.720 --> 28:20.000
and I Google the definition for erudite,

28:20.000 --> 28:23.600
which is so embarrassing on like three different levels

28:24.560 --> 28:25.680
at the same time.

28:25.680 --> 28:26.240
Erudite.

28:27.760 --> 28:31.440
So, I mean, Justin, I'm gonna go ahead and tell you,

28:31.440 --> 28:32.640
we are talking about Frasier,

28:32.640 --> 28:34.320
and I think Aaliyah Shawkat as Frasier

28:34.320 --> 28:36.160
is one of the boldest sort of choices you've-

28:36.880 --> 28:37.360
Frasier!

28:37.360 --> 28:39.440
I put it right up there with Larry Bird though,

28:39.440 --> 28:42.480
who I think right there, Larry Bird was announced

28:42.480 --> 28:45.040
and I think a big part of the audience was like,

28:45.040 --> 28:46.800
no thank you, stunt casting.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.440
But it wasn't stunt casting, he auditioned.

28:49.440 --> 28:51.600
He said, don't give it to me just on my name,

28:51.600 --> 28:53.120
give it to me based on merit.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.800
He auditioned, nailed it.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.320
Even Kelsey Grammer was like,

28:56.320 --> 28:59.360
that's more, he's more Frasier than-

28:59.360 --> 29:00.800
He's Frasiest.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.480
And so they gave it to Larry Bird

29:02.480 --> 29:03.520
and Larry Bird did great.

29:03.520 --> 29:04.960
He ran for nine seasons.

29:05.760 --> 29:11.040
I think that most television sitcom producers are cowards.

29:11.040 --> 29:11.520
Yeah.

29:11.520 --> 29:14.960
Because, let me hit you with this.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Season three finale of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,

29:19.680 --> 29:24.560
they fucking, Aunt Viv is like walking down the stairs

29:24.560 --> 29:27.920
and then like trips and goes over and falls horribly

29:27.920 --> 29:29.760
and is just dunsies.

29:29.760 --> 29:33.040
And Fresh Prince is like, oh no!

29:33.040 --> 29:35.040
But then she transforms into a different actress

29:35.040 --> 29:38.560
and that's the way that they fucking write that out.

29:38.560 --> 29:39.520
That's how they write that off.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.480
You don't just do a switch, fucking Two and a Half Men.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.840
Well, I guess they did do a sort of in-fiction thing

29:45.840 --> 29:47.200
for Two and a Half Men, but-

29:47.200 --> 29:49.440
But not to say he didn't just regenerate

29:49.440 --> 29:50.880
into a different character.

29:50.880 --> 29:51.520
That's fair.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.160
Because here's the thing, Doctor Who,

29:54.160 --> 29:57.680
that was bullshit they made up to recast the part, right?

29:57.680 --> 29:58.400
Yeah.

29:58.400 --> 30:01.440
It's not like, well, it's just true about Time Lords.

30:01.440 --> 30:02.720
No, they fucking made that up.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.400
Anyone could make that up.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.760
Anyone can do it.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.440
You guys wanna hear the fucking best,

30:07.440 --> 30:09.680
I actually have the best casting for Frasier and Nott.

30:09.680 --> 30:10.000
Okay.

30:10.000 --> 30:10.240
Okay.

30:12.240 --> 30:15.440
This is what would happen if it was getting rebooted today.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.560
I'm gonna get Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons

30:18.560 --> 30:19.360
as Frasier and Nott.

30:19.360 --> 30:19.920
I love it.

30:21.200 --> 30:21.680
They're back.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.760
They're back together again.

30:23.760 --> 30:24.800
Okay.

30:24.800 --> 30:27.680
The Big Bangs are banging once more.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.880
And get Kaylee for Daphne.

30:30.880 --> 30:33.440
Now, Justin, it just kind of feels like what you're doing

30:34.080 --> 30:37.200
is you're both rebooting Frasier,

30:37.200 --> 30:38.800
but also Big Bang Theory.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.280
This is sort of your back door.

30:41.280 --> 30:42.640
Mayim Bialik is Ross.

30:42.640 --> 30:43.760
Mayim Bialik is Ross.

30:43.760 --> 30:44.160
Easy.

30:44.160 --> 30:47.360
Okay, you're just kind of slamming Big Bang Theory

30:47.360 --> 30:50.080
and Frasier together and seeing what noise it makes.

30:50.080 --> 30:53.600
I'm just hearing the wet slap of Frasier and Big Bang Theory

30:53.600 --> 30:56.000
just kind of running into each other in your large head.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.520
Who plays Martin, Justin?

30:58.240 --> 30:59.200
Wil Wheaton.

30:59.200 --> 30:59.520
Okay.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.280
And who plays the dog?

31:01.280 --> 31:02.320
John Ross Bowie.

31:02.320 --> 31:07.280
John Ross Bowie is back with Christine.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.680
Christine Baranski was on Big Bang Theory.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.080
Okay.

31:10.080 --> 31:10.720
Perfect.

31:10.720 --> 31:11.120
You guys know a lot about this.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.120
I think she was probably also on Frasier.

31:13.120 --> 31:15.680
You guys know a lot about Big Bang Theory.

31:16.880 --> 31:17.440
Thank you, girl.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.640
Yeah, you know, you hope somebody's gonna notice.

31:23.840 --> 31:24.480
Let's take a quick break.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.520
Oh, wait, hold on, Justin.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.760
Parsons, Galecki.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.040
Which one's which?

31:29.040 --> 31:29.840
Which one's Frasier?

31:29.840 --> 31:31.120
Which one's Niles?

31:31.120 --> 31:32.880
True West.

31:32.880 --> 31:33.760
True West, baby.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.800
It's True Westing it.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.120
True Westing it, baby.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.120
Every episode's a True West.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.720
And so they swap episode to episode,

31:40.720 --> 31:42.320
not halfway through each episode?

31:43.120 --> 31:43.840
Interesting.

31:43.840 --> 31:48.480
No, every commercial break, that's the best option.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.000
There's very distinct glasses.

31:50.000 --> 31:50.880
That's great.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.880
Maybe they have hats that they always wear.

31:53.920 --> 31:54.960
Let's take a quick break

31:54.960 --> 31:58.880
and then we'll be right back with more great content.

31:58.880 --> 32:02.560
Holy shit.

32:02.560 --> 32:03.060
Smooth.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.640
Do you guys remember when Kelsey Grammer fell off that stage?

32:06.640 --> 32:07.680
Oh, yeah, baby.

32:07.680 --> 32:08.640
I think about it every day.

32:08.640 --> 32:09.680
Every single day.

32:20.560 --> 32:21.440
Hey, Griffin.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.240
Yeah.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.680
Bring me some food.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.760
Nope, you're too far away from me.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.840
No, I'll tell you what food I want.

32:27.840 --> 32:28.480
Okay.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.160
And I'll give you money for it.

32:30.160 --> 32:30.720
Right.

32:30.720 --> 32:32.320
But you have to bring it to me.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.720
No, you're several thousand miles away.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.360
That sucks.

32:35.360 --> 32:36.320
What am I supposed to do?

32:38.000 --> 32:38.720
Starve.

32:39.520 --> 32:40.000
Damn it.

32:40.560 --> 32:41.520
Or use DoorDash.

32:41.520 --> 32:42.160
You can do DoorDash.

32:42.160 --> 32:42.800
Oh.

32:42.800 --> 32:43.280
Yeah, that's the other option.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.280
What is this DoorDash you mentioned?

32:45.280 --> 32:46.640
Oh, it's the app that brings food

32:46.640 --> 32:49.120
that you're craving right now to your door.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.320
It's weird that you're asking me all this

32:50.320 --> 32:52.000
because it is in the copy points.

32:52.000 --> 32:52.720
And so I think like if this is a-

32:52.720 --> 32:54.240
Oh, wait, you're reading from something?

32:54.240 --> 32:56.800
If this is like a need that you need filled,

32:56.800 --> 33:00.080
there's literal text information in front of you.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.200
It's really easy to use it.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.480
You just open the DoorDash app

33:02.480 --> 33:03.440
and you choose what you want to eat

33:03.440 --> 33:05.840
and then your food will be left safely outside your door

33:05.840 --> 33:08.480
with the new contactless delivery drop-off setting.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.640
And then they have all your favorite local restaurants

33:10.640 --> 33:12.000
that are open for delivery.

33:12.000 --> 33:12.560
And you just pick them-

33:12.560 --> 33:14.800
I haven't gotten any new food into my house

33:14.800 --> 33:16.480
since March of 2020.

33:16.480 --> 33:17.840
Oh, no, that's not good.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.360
Well, you should be getting more food,

33:21.360 --> 33:23.600
but also DoorDash is a really great way to do it.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.760
And right now our listeners can get $5 off

33:25.760 --> 33:27.840
their first order of $15 or more

33:27.840 --> 33:30.240
and zero delivery fees for their first month

33:30.240 --> 33:31.600
when you download the DoorDash app

33:31.600 --> 33:32.960
and enter the code BROTHER.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.480
That's $5 off your first order

33:34.480 --> 33:35.840
and zero delivery fees for a month

33:35.840 --> 33:37.120
when you download the DoorDash app

33:37.120 --> 33:38.720
in the app store and enter code BROTHER.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.000
Don't forget one last time,

33:40.000 --> 33:43.520
that's BROTHER for $5 off your first order with DoorDash.

33:43.520 --> 33:44.320
Hey Justin.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.160
What's up?

33:46.160 --> 33:47.760
I want you to make me a website.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.640
I don't know how to make a website.

33:50.640 --> 33:52.160
Well, I'll tell you how to make it.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.440
And then if anything breaks on it,

33:53.440 --> 33:55.680
you'll be there to help me fix it 24-7.

33:56.800 --> 33:57.920
How's that sound?

33:57.920 --> 33:59.600
That's a huge amount of pressure, Travis.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.200
I don't think I can.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.760
Well, I need you to use some beautiful templates

34:04.960 --> 34:07.600
and I need help showcasing my work

34:07.600 --> 34:09.760
and selling products and services of all kinds.

34:10.720 --> 34:12.480
And I assume you offer analytics

34:12.480 --> 34:14.080
that help me grow in real time?

34:14.080 --> 34:16.880
I can barely do the website.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.720
What fucking good are you then?

34:18.720 --> 34:20.080
I'm just gonna use Squarespace.

34:20.720 --> 34:22.160
You can get, hey,

34:22.160 --> 34:23.840
you can both get out of here.

34:23.840 --> 34:27.680
From now on, I got two brothers, DoorDash and Squarespace.

34:28.880 --> 34:29.600
That's it.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.760
Those are the only brothers I answer to

34:31.760 --> 34:34.080
and I look forward to spending Christmas with them.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.720
Wow, this is so combative.

34:38.720 --> 34:40.720
Hey Squarespace, I love you.

34:40.720 --> 34:42.160
We're blood now.

34:42.160 --> 34:45.840
Thank you for helping me promote my physical online business.

34:45.840 --> 34:48.880
Thank you for having everything optimized for mobile

34:48.880 --> 34:50.000
right out of the box.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.160
Thank you for free and secure hosting

34:52.160 --> 34:54.080
and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.840
You've always been there for me

34:55.840 --> 34:58.240
unlike my two lazy brothers

34:58.240 --> 35:01.840
who will neither bring me food nor build me a website.

35:01.840 --> 35:05.040
So everyone else leave your friends and family behind

35:05.040 --> 35:08.720
and join the family Squarespace with open arms.

35:08.720 --> 35:12.400
Go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

35:12.400 --> 35:13.360
When you're ready to launch,

35:13.360 --> 35:15.920
use the offer code my brother to save 10%

35:15.920 --> 35:18.640
off your first purchase of a website or domain.

35:18.640 --> 35:21.440
Squarespace, all the family you'll ever need.

35:21.440 --> 35:22.720
It says that.

35:22.720 --> 35:26.240
It says only us, no one else or else we'll know

35:26.240 --> 35:27.440
and it's over.

35:27.440 --> 35:30.640
It says turn over all your physical belongings

35:30.640 --> 35:31.600
to Squarespace.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.760
We're all the family you'll ever need.

35:33.760 --> 35:36.000
Wild that it says that.

35:36.000 --> 35:36.720
It does.

35:36.720 --> 35:37.760
I don't think that's good.

35:38.560 --> 35:41.520
I mean, listen, from my experience so far,

35:41.520 --> 35:42.880
it's all the family I need.

35:42.880 --> 35:43.380
Okay.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.560
Hi, my name is Graham Clark

35:46.560 --> 35:50.720
and I'm one half of the podcast stop podcasting yourself,

35:50.720 --> 35:53.440
a show that we've recorded for many, many years.

35:53.440 --> 35:56.480
And at the moment, instead of being in person,

35:56.480 --> 36:00.080
we're recording remotely and you wouldn't even notice.

36:00.080 --> 36:01.440
You don't even notice the lag.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.400
That's right, Graham.

36:06.400 --> 36:10.240
And the great thing about this, go ahead.

36:10.960 --> 36:11.760
No, you go ahead.

36:12.320 --> 36:12.800
Okay.

36:12.800 --> 36:13.600
Okay, go ahead.

36:13.600 --> 36:19.040
And you can listen to us every week on MaximumFun.org.

36:19.040 --> 36:21.200
Or wherever you get your podcasts.

36:21.840 --> 36:22.800
Your podcasts.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.360
Can I do another Yahoo that was sent in by a lot of people?

36:27.920 --> 36:31.360
Give me that big, dirty, stinky Yahoo.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.160
Jesus.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.680
This one was sent in by several people.

36:35.680 --> 36:37.840
Like I said, it's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

36:38.640 --> 36:41.760
who I'm going to call Tammy.

36:41.760 --> 36:46.880
Tammy asks, is it impolite not to open the window

36:46.880 --> 36:50.080
when a crow who used to be my friend knocks on it?

36:50.640 --> 36:54.240
Wait, I used to be friends with a crow in my street.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.680
He comes to my window for snacks

36:55.680 --> 36:57.600
and has sometimes brought me cool rocks.

36:57.600 --> 37:00.800
But last week he saw me walk my dog and hacked at him.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.160
My dog was so scared.

37:02.160 --> 37:05.120
I'm extremely mad at the crow now and can't even look at him.

37:05.120 --> 37:06.640
He doesn't get snacks anymore.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.480
But now he started to knock on my window.

37:08.480 --> 37:11.440
I feel so impolite not opening, but I am still angry.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.600
Should I maybe wait until he is sorry

37:13.600 --> 37:14.960
or apologizes in some way?

37:16.160 --> 37:18.080
Well, neither of those are going to happen.

37:18.080 --> 37:22.880
Yeah, I will tell you, Griffin, for a second there,

37:22.880 --> 37:25.440
I thought what the question asker meant was,

37:26.480 --> 37:27.920
this is my friend.

37:27.920 --> 37:30.240
He died and is now a crow.

37:30.240 --> 37:31.040
Oh, interesting.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.640
Yeah, and he keeps knocking on my window.

37:34.640 --> 37:36.480
Let me tell you this, Tammy.

37:36.480 --> 37:41.040
Your mistake here was you forgot that at the end of the day,

37:41.040 --> 37:45.200
no matter how many shiny stones or snacks

37:45.200 --> 37:47.840
you exchange with this crow, it's still a crow.

37:48.720 --> 37:52.000
And crows is going to hack at dogs, right?

37:52.000 --> 37:55.360
This is kind of like the frog and the scorpion

37:56.240 --> 37:58.400
where the scorpion's like, hey, give me a ride.

37:58.400 --> 38:01.040
And the frog's like, no way, dude, you're a scorpion.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.000
And he's like, nah, it's cool.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.360
If I kill you, I'll die too.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.880
And then he does kill him and he dies too.

38:04.880 --> 38:07.600
And he's like, you forgot I was a scorpion.

38:07.600 --> 38:08.160
Wow.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.640
Except this is like the Tammy and the crow

38:11.600 --> 38:13.280
where Tammy was like, hey, be my buddy.

38:13.280 --> 38:15.040
And the crow's like, you absolutely got it.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.800
Also, I'm going to peck your fingers.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.080
And you're like, oh, a crow?

38:18.080 --> 38:19.520
It's like, yeah, I'm a fucking crow, dude.

38:20.560 --> 38:21.760
I don't know what to tell you.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.600
Here's a shiny pebble or whatever the fuck.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.600
Did you read, there's an internet story,

38:27.600 --> 38:31.040
one of those like, nature is beautiful.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.240
Where it was like this crow

38:32.240 --> 38:34.800
that like befriended a family or something.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.520
And then one day the family like,

38:37.520 --> 38:41.200
dropped their camera lens cap off of like, a thing.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.640
And they're like, oh no.

38:42.640 --> 38:43.840
And then like, the next day,

38:43.840 --> 38:45.520
the crow had brought it back to them.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.880
And that's fucking great, man.

38:48.880 --> 38:49.920
That's beautiful.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.520
Tell me another one, Pawpaw.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.960
That crow was really there for them.

38:55.680 --> 38:58.080
Hey, Pawpaw, will you tell me one about the war?

38:59.360 --> 39:01.760
Well, one time I was down at Foxhole,

39:01.760 --> 39:03.040
really missing my sweetie.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.560
And when I woke up the next morning,

39:04.560 --> 39:08.640
a crow had flown my girlfriend over to Germany.

39:08.640 --> 39:09.360
Same crow?

39:10.080 --> 39:12.080
Yeah, and we made love while the crow watched.

39:12.080 --> 39:12.880
That was the deal.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.640
That was kind of the one stipulation.

39:16.640 --> 39:19.600
So it's like, War Crow, the 2011 movie.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.040
Did you guys ever see War Crow?

39:21.040 --> 39:22.400
And my girlfriend got pregnant

39:23.440 --> 39:24.880
and we named the baby the crow.

39:25.840 --> 39:29.760
Did you guys ever see War Crow by Steven Spielberg?

39:29.760 --> 39:32.320
The movie where that wartime couple

39:32.320 --> 39:34.720
made love in front of a crow?

39:34.720 --> 39:37.440
It had an extended 49-minute long

39:37.440 --> 39:39.040
Foxhole-based sex scene,

39:39.040 --> 39:42.880
while it was actually a grackle that they cast.

39:42.880 --> 39:43.920
A stunt grackle.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.080
Just watched the whole thing

39:46.080 --> 39:48.080
and is, I guess, inspired a generation?

39:48.720 --> 39:49.220
Yep.

39:50.240 --> 39:53.120
I have seen some crows around my place lately.

39:53.120 --> 39:55.440
I was driving home a couple weeks ago

39:55.440 --> 39:58.480
and there was like 20 crows lined on the road

39:58.480 --> 40:01.600
blocking my return to my home.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.240
You know what that means?

40:02.240 --> 40:03.440
That was extreme.

40:03.440 --> 40:03.920
Do you?

40:03.920 --> 40:04.160
Do you?

40:04.160 --> 40:04.660
Yeah.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.800
Gonna be a long, cold summer.

40:07.760 --> 40:09.040
Long, cold summer.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.360
But the thing I want to say about crows

40:11.360 --> 40:13.600
is when you see a crow in real life,

40:15.840 --> 40:18.080
it doesn't look like they should be that big.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.600
They're extremely big.

40:19.600 --> 40:20.880
And when you see a crow, it's kind of like,

40:20.880 --> 40:21.600
whoa, are you sure?

40:21.600 --> 40:24.880
Yeah, the first time I saw a crow was in War Crow

40:24.880 --> 40:28.480
and I wasn't expecting them to have four legs

40:28.480 --> 40:31.520
and big, meaty haunches and a very long head.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.560
Is War Crow especially big

40:34.560 --> 40:36.160
or is it just he's got a lot of heart?

40:36.160 --> 40:36.640
He's got a lot of heart.

40:36.640 --> 40:37.200
Well, it's both.

40:38.160 --> 40:38.640
It's both.

40:38.640 --> 40:40.960
He's very large and he cares a great deal.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.600
And well, no, his physical heart is far too big

40:43.600 --> 40:46.480
and that's why he dies in the movie.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.920
But then they make an apartment out of his heart

40:49.920 --> 40:51.680
like at the end of James and the Giant Peach.

40:51.680 --> 40:53.360
I haven't seen War Horse.

40:53.360 --> 40:54.000
And what's this?

40:54.000 --> 40:54.720
That's a sequel.

40:54.720 --> 40:55.200
Oh, okay.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.080
Sequel.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.200
I haven't seen War Horse,

40:57.760 --> 41:00.080
but I assume from the title,

41:00.080 --> 41:03.440
it means it's the first and only horse used in war.

41:03.440 --> 41:05.520
And that must have been very disconcerting

41:05.520 --> 41:07.120
for everybody on the battlefield

41:07.120 --> 41:08.160
the first time that a horse entered.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.760
Get that thing the fuck out of here.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.040
Wait, what do we do with this?

41:11.040 --> 41:11.920
Can we throw it?

41:11.920 --> 41:13.280
What are you supposed to do with that?

41:13.280 --> 41:15.680
I'm afraid I'm trying to shoot humans.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.040
I'm gonna hit a beautiful horse.

41:17.040 --> 41:20.000
To be fair, I was on the other side.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.160
If I was on the other side, right?

41:22.160 --> 41:24.160
If I was the enemy and suddenly I just saw

41:24.160 --> 41:26.800
a horse walking towards me,

41:26.800 --> 41:28.320
I would lower my gun and be like,

41:28.320 --> 41:29.920
hey now, what's up?

41:29.920 --> 41:31.840
But then that horse pulls out a gun,

41:31.840 --> 41:32.880
shoots the man.

41:32.880 --> 41:33.200
Dang it.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.000
I'm like, oh shit.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.320
I feel like using a War Horse

41:36.320 --> 41:38.160
is an abuse of the beautiful relationship

41:38.160 --> 41:39.200
between a human and a horse.

41:39.200 --> 41:39.700
Sure.

41:41.440 --> 41:43.040
They trust you implicitly.

41:43.040 --> 41:44.880
Your souls are intertwined.

41:44.880 --> 41:46.560
You shouldn't be leading them in battle

41:46.560 --> 41:48.640
against other humans because they will,

41:48.640 --> 41:50.160
but they're gonna be up that night like,

41:50.160 --> 41:50.480
what's going on?

41:50.480 --> 41:50.960
Unless.

41:52.960 --> 41:54.320
It's reciprocated.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.080
If there's a war between horses,

41:56.080 --> 41:57.360
the horse gets to bring us.

41:57.360 --> 41:59.680
The sequel to War Horse is Horse War.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.400
Yes, Horse War is the sequel.

42:02.400 --> 42:03.360
And the horse is like,

42:03.360 --> 42:04.960
I will take you to kill these men,

42:05.520 --> 42:11.520
but you must promise me that when my people go to war,

42:12.160 --> 42:13.040
you will be there.

42:13.040 --> 42:15.120
I will be riding your back at that time.

42:15.120 --> 42:17.440
I will ride you into battle, Jeff.

42:17.440 --> 42:19.040
This is my steed, Jeff.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.640
Whatever you say, Butter Maiden.

42:20.640 --> 42:21.520
You got it.

42:21.520 --> 42:22.020
All right.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.600
Jeff, it's the Butter Maiden.

42:26.640 --> 42:27.520
The time has come.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.240
What?

42:28.240 --> 42:29.040
The time has come.

42:29.040 --> 42:30.160
Really?

42:30.160 --> 42:31.280
Holy shit.

42:31.280 --> 42:31.840
Yeah, dude.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.760
The fracture between the Calgrani

42:33.760 --> 42:35.840
and the Bilatush has gone too far.

42:36.480 --> 42:37.840
There will be no peace.

42:38.400 --> 42:39.200
You, Jeff.

42:39.760 --> 42:40.560
Saddle up, Jeff.

42:40.560 --> 42:43.280
Do you have the long stick of Far Death?

42:43.280 --> 42:44.320
My gun?

42:44.320 --> 42:44.960
Yeah, we still-

42:44.960 --> 42:45.520
Yes.

42:45.520 --> 42:46.560
Yeah, I still have that.

42:46.560 --> 42:47.360
Bring it.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.560
I've seen what it does.

42:48.560 --> 42:51.360
I bet it will be effective on horse flesh.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.680
Now put on the saddle, Jeff.

42:53.680 --> 42:54.160
Enlist your foals.

42:54.160 --> 42:55.360
No, not on me.

42:55.360 --> 42:55.920
Do your foals.

42:56.400 --> 42:56.900
No.

42:57.600 --> 43:00.400
We've covered that Butter Maiden will be riding Jeff.

43:00.400 --> 43:00.800
Obviously.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.400
That's established canon at this point.

43:03.120 --> 43:04.400
Don't make horses go to war.

43:04.400 --> 43:21.360
I love you.

43:21.360 --> 43:22.480
Welcome to Munch Squad's podcast,

43:22.480 --> 43:25.040
the podcast profiling the latest and greatest brand eating.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.800
We have already talked about the Jelly Belly treasure hunt

43:28.800 --> 43:30.480
that has nothing to do with Jelly Belly.

43:30.480 --> 43:35.280
And now it's time for a celebrate good times.

43:35.280 --> 43:35.840
Come on.

43:35.840 --> 43:36.480
Sorry, a what?

43:37.360 --> 43:38.960
It's a celebration.

43:38.960 --> 43:39.840
Okay, wait, can I guess?

43:40.960 --> 43:42.240
He just chose Crab Shack?

43:43.440 --> 43:44.080
No, sir.

43:44.080 --> 43:50.160
Planners unveils a collaboration to celebrate baby nuts.

43:54.160 --> 43:56.240
That's what they went with, baby nut?

43:56.240 --> 43:57.200
Yeah, bud.

43:57.200 --> 44:02.160
So Mr. Peanut didn't die as he was supposed to,

44:02.880 --> 44:07.200
but at the same time, Mr. Peanut apparently has had a child

44:07.200 --> 44:09.280
this whole time named Baby Nut,

44:09.840 --> 44:13.760
but Baby Nut turned 21 and is now Peanut Jr.

44:13.760 --> 44:15.520
Wait, are you with me so far?

44:15.520 --> 44:16.400
Absolutely not.

44:17.680 --> 44:18.160
Okay.

44:18.160 --> 44:19.920
Is this like one of those timelines things

44:19.920 --> 44:22.560
where like one comic book series is about Wolverine,

44:22.560 --> 44:25.440
but one is about like Logan before he became a Wolverine

44:25.440 --> 44:29.120
and one is about like Weapon X or these all happening?

44:29.120 --> 44:30.400
It's all happening at the same time.

44:31.280 --> 44:32.960
Mr. Peanut had a son.

44:32.960 --> 44:34.480
The son was named Baby Nut.

44:35.200 --> 44:37.440
The son turned 21 and became Peanut Jr.

44:37.440 --> 44:38.640
He's got Jack disease.

44:39.760 --> 44:42.240
No, he's 21 years old.

44:42.240 --> 44:46.240
So wait, Mr. Peanut had this son 21 years ago

44:46.240 --> 44:48.400
and this is just the first time we're hearing about him?

44:48.400 --> 44:50.000
Was he born out?

44:50.000 --> 44:52.480
Have you been paying that close of attention to Mr. Peanut?

44:52.480 --> 44:53.840
Like in every ad if he's like,

44:53.840 --> 44:55.840
and also I have a son anyway, eat peanuts.

44:55.840 --> 44:56.800
Oh, I see what you're saying.

44:58.400 --> 45:00.400
I will say that this actually makes sense.

45:00.400 --> 45:01.840
That one time I was watching it was like,

45:01.840 --> 45:03.840
we got all kinds of nuts and it makes sense.

45:03.840 --> 45:06.000
And then he opens the letter and he reads it

45:06.000 --> 45:07.600
and he kind of crumbles it up and he's like,

45:07.600 --> 45:10.000
I'm not ready to accept this responsibility.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.320
And now I understand what that was in reference to.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.680
If this Munch Squad were a loading screen,

45:15.680 --> 45:17.440
it would be at 3% progress.

45:17.440 --> 45:18.400
I must move on.

45:19.120 --> 45:20.400
Mr. Peanut has a son.

45:20.400 --> 45:21.280
His name was Baby Nut.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.920
He turned 21 and became Peanut Junior.

45:23.920 --> 45:25.040
Okay, yeah.

45:26.720 --> 45:27.680
To celebrate this,

45:30.320 --> 45:33.200
planners today unveiled a limited edition run

45:33.200 --> 45:36.400
of beer flavored peanuts co-branded with Natural Light

45:36.400 --> 45:37.680
as part of a marketing stunt

45:37.680 --> 45:39.600
surrounding the rapidly aging spokes nut.

45:40.160 --> 45:44.240
Planners and Natural Light beer flavored peanuts.

45:44.240 --> 45:46.640
Oh, hey, press release.

45:46.640 --> 45:49.920
You can't just throw in a term like rapidly aging

45:49.920 --> 45:52.960
and not make me think of like a Star Trek episode

45:52.960 --> 45:54.560
or a Doctor Who episode.

45:54.560 --> 45:56.320
Like, listen, he'll be dead within the week.

45:56.320 --> 45:57.120
Let him have this.

45:58.640 --> 46:02.720
So the Natural, I don't want to be classist,

46:03.360 --> 46:06.000
but Natural Light isn't the best tasting liquid.

46:06.720 --> 46:11.120
But there's other liquids that I think are superior in taste.

46:11.120 --> 46:13.520
In fact, other liquids in the beer family.

46:13.520 --> 46:17.520
In fact, other liquids in the cost-effective,

46:17.520 --> 46:20.080
low-cost beer family that tastes maybe even

46:20.080 --> 46:22.800
just a little bit better than old Natty Light.

46:22.800 --> 46:24.800
So strange bedfellows.

46:25.600 --> 46:28.080
Perhaps a Miller High Life.

46:28.080 --> 46:30.160
It is the Champagne of beers.

46:30.160 --> 46:31.040
I would take that.

46:31.040 --> 46:35.120
Or perhaps a PBR, well-known hipster brand.

46:35.120 --> 46:35.620
Yeah.

46:36.800 --> 46:37.680
Justin, what else?

46:38.960 --> 46:40.480
I'm trying to piece this all together,

46:40.960 --> 46:43.920
but planners, so Baby Nut.

46:43.920 --> 46:44.420
Baby Nut.

46:48.000 --> 46:48.880
So, okay.

46:48.880 --> 46:49.280
All right.

46:49.280 --> 46:50.720
I'm trying to piece this together.

46:50.720 --> 46:53.680
Justin, you've got a lot of string tied up on this board here

46:53.680 --> 46:55.280
with a lot of pictures going between it.

46:55.280 --> 46:56.080
Please explain.

46:56.800 --> 46:57.120
Right.

46:57.120 --> 46:57.600
Okay.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.840
So remember when Mr. Peanut died?

46:59.840 --> 47:00.340
Yes.

47:00.880 --> 47:01.120
Yeah.

47:01.120 --> 47:01.600
Okay.

47:03.600 --> 47:04.800
Worst day of my fucking life.

47:05.360 --> 47:10.720
So at that time, Baby Nut is what?

47:10.720 --> 47:13.440
More from the corpse of Mr. Peanut?

47:13.440 --> 47:14.320
As I understand it?

47:14.320 --> 47:14.960
Yeah, yeah.

47:14.960 --> 47:15.280
Totally.

47:15.280 --> 47:16.000
I didn't want to correct you.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.400
Death of Superman, then there was Superboy,

47:18.400 --> 47:21.920
and the Last Crooked Don, and then I believe Steel

47:21.920 --> 47:24.400
was in there as well, and yeah, of course.

47:24.400 --> 47:30.000
So he was Baby Nut is what formed from the husk of Mr. Peanut.

47:31.040 --> 47:31.600
Sorry?

47:31.600 --> 47:32.400
Like a phoenix.

47:34.160 --> 47:34.800
Okay, sure.

47:35.840 --> 47:36.480
That's fine.

47:37.440 --> 47:41.840
But he formed from the husk of Mr. Peanut,

47:41.840 --> 47:48.720
and then he is transmogrifying now into Peanut Jr.

47:48.720 --> 47:50.320
Does that make sense?

47:50.320 --> 47:50.560
Huh.

47:50.560 --> 47:52.000
You can keep saying it.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.160
This is, I think, about the fifth time

47:54.160 --> 47:56.720
that you've tried to walk us through the timeline of Baby Nut.

47:57.280 --> 47:58.160
So here's the ad.

47:58.160 --> 47:59.360
Give me 20 seconds.

47:59.360 --> 48:00.080
Just listen to this.

48:00.080 --> 48:00.720
Don't say anything.

48:01.520 --> 48:02.020
I.D.?

48:03.120 --> 48:03.600
Yes, sir.

48:05.200 --> 48:08.560
Wait, so you're telling me you fell off a cliff,

48:08.560 --> 48:11.760
came back to life as a baby, and now you're 21?

48:13.520 --> 48:14.320
Yeah.

48:14.320 --> 48:15.280
Yeah, it's been a weird year.

48:19.600 --> 48:24.640
So Mr. Peanut Jr., he's now 21, and because of that,

48:24.640 --> 48:29.120
they're making beer nuts that are flavored like the,

48:29.840 --> 48:30.640
you understand?

48:30.640 --> 48:30.880
Yes.

48:30.880 --> 48:31.680
Yeah, but if I-

48:31.680 --> 48:35.920
And it's to celebrate people who miss their birthdays due to COVID.

48:36.800 --> 48:37.840
That's what this says here.

48:37.840 --> 48:39.360
That's super, read the exact quote.

48:39.360 --> 48:40.880
That sounds super nice.

48:40.880 --> 48:43.440
This comes after Baby Nut, who was introduced in February

48:43.440 --> 48:45.120
during Planner's controversial Super Bowl ad,

48:45.120 --> 48:47.280
morphed into Peanut Jr. earlier this month

48:47.280 --> 48:50.160
as a way to connect with consumers whose birthdays have gone by

48:50.160 --> 48:53.200
with little to no fanfare due to COVID-19 quarantine measures.

48:53.200 --> 48:55.200
That's so sweet.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.960
That's really nice of them.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.960
Can I also just pull back your curtain there a little bit?

48:58.960 --> 49:00.960
Because what they're basically saying is like,

49:00.960 --> 49:04.080
we committed to this like Baby Peanut bit

49:04.080 --> 49:05.440
and weren't going anywhere with it.

49:05.440 --> 49:09.760
So as soon as we saw the slimmest off ramp, we took it.

49:09.760 --> 49:10.800
Right, we took it.

49:10.800 --> 49:11.920
Now it's Peanut Jr.

49:11.920 --> 49:14.800
And can I also say just after that ad you played it,

49:14.800 --> 49:17.680
it does kind of sound like Peanut Jr. is using a fake ID.

49:19.280 --> 49:20.000
It's very suspicious, yeah.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.760
The read on it is definitely like,

49:21.760 --> 49:23.920
huh, yeah, it's been a weird year.

49:23.920 --> 49:26.320
Can I have my beer now, please, sir?

49:26.320 --> 49:27.200
Please.

49:27.200 --> 49:30.560
At the time when he morphed, the quote was this,

49:30.560 --> 49:32.640
Peanut Jr. still has a lot to learn,

49:32.640 --> 49:34.960
like what his favorite go-to drink is,

49:34.960 --> 49:37.920
as he continues to grow up to become a peanut of the people.

49:37.920 --> 49:38.420
Jesus.

49:38.960 --> 49:41.600
And apparently, that was the quote given at that point, right?

49:41.600 --> 49:43.760
But now we know what his favorite drink is,

49:43.760 --> 49:45.520
and it's apparently Natty Light.

49:45.520 --> 49:46.020
Yeah.

49:46.880 --> 49:49.760
Which actually tracks.

49:49.760 --> 49:51.200
I mean, it tracks, except for the fact

49:51.200 --> 49:54.960
that he probably inherited the peanut planter's fortune.

49:54.960 --> 49:55.520
Yeah.

49:55.520 --> 49:57.760
And does not need to drink Natty Light.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.200
Oh, it's ironic.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.760
Maybe that's what's happening.

50:01.760 --> 50:06.960
Okay, I would have gone with a Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,

50:06.960 --> 50:12.800
but that would just be my guess for what baby junior Mr. Peanut is into.

50:12.800 --> 50:14.800
So now we're going to go a little bit deeper.

50:14.800 --> 50:18.880
See, Natural Light is an economy beer brand

50:18.880 --> 50:20.960
owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev,

50:22.080 --> 50:25.440
which, like planter's owner Kraft Heinz,

50:25.440 --> 50:29.120
has ties to Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital.

50:29.120 --> 50:30.080
Wait a minute.

50:30.080 --> 50:31.760
This goes all the way to the top.

50:31.760 --> 50:34.400
It goes all the way to the top, baby.

50:34.400 --> 50:36.960
5G isn't causing COVID,

50:36.960 --> 50:40.960
but 3G is causing Natural Light flavored plant's peanuts.

50:42.960 --> 50:46.400
It goes all the way to the top, and you can buy these nuts.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.640
It just says here, I tried to click the link,

50:48.640 --> 50:51.760
it just says you can buy these nuts if you're a dirt bag, it says.

50:51.760 --> 50:54.240
So I guess if you're a dirt bag, you should be able to find them.

50:54.240 --> 50:56.560
As is so often the case with MunchSquad,

50:57.440 --> 50:58.800
now I want to try it.

50:58.800 --> 51:00.560
I didn't before.

51:00.560 --> 51:01.440
Nothing goes together.

51:01.440 --> 51:02.240
This is from Mike,

51:03.440 --> 51:05.600
executive creative director at Fainter Media,

51:05.600 --> 51:08.640
which has engineered a lot of evil in the past few years.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.280
Nothing goes together like beer and nuts.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.120
We were thrilled to work with Natural Light

51:13.120 --> 51:15.840
to make the union official with beer flavored peanuts.

51:16.400 --> 51:21.040
Okay, but it's not like when Cheez-It and House Wine partnered,

51:21.040 --> 51:23.440
they didn't make wine flavored Cheez-Its.

51:23.440 --> 51:26.400
That would be actually very good.

51:26.400 --> 51:26.960
Pretty cool.

51:26.960 --> 51:28.720
I think I would actually really like that.

51:28.720 --> 51:30.800
I have had a peanut butter stout before.

51:30.800 --> 51:33.600
I have had what I would call nut flavored beer.

51:33.600 --> 51:34.240
Okay, do you like it?

51:34.240 --> 51:35.600
I am not at all interested.

51:35.600 --> 51:37.760
It's a weird flex, but okay.

51:37.760 --> 51:39.520
I'm just saying I'm not at all.

51:39.520 --> 51:40.160
If someone said,

51:40.160 --> 51:43.440
do you want me to soak these peanuts in beer before you eat them?

51:43.440 --> 51:44.000
That's probably not.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.440
I would say that sounds disgusting.

51:45.440 --> 51:48.560
I'd assume the nuts are not soggy and wet, Travis.

51:48.560 --> 51:50.960
And I'd hope not, but what do you picture?

51:51.760 --> 51:53.920
It's got beer dust on it?

51:53.920 --> 51:54.640
Just like a dusting of beer flavor.

51:54.640 --> 51:55.840
Like a flavor of beer.

51:55.840 --> 51:56.800
Like a flavor of beer.

51:56.800 --> 51:57.840
You know how flavoring works.

51:57.840 --> 51:59.760
Probably made with beaver anus.

52:00.480 --> 52:01.520
Why did you say that?

52:01.520 --> 52:02.320
Why would you say that?

52:02.320 --> 52:07.360
Oh, they use beaver like anus like juices

52:07.360 --> 52:09.520
in a lot of fake flavorings.

52:10.720 --> 52:13.200
That's so gross, Travis, why do you do that?

52:13.200 --> 52:14.560
I don't do it.

52:15.520 --> 52:16.320
You don't do it.

52:17.280 --> 52:18.720
That is a real thing.

52:18.720 --> 52:20.400
Now everyone listen to the sound of,

52:20.400 --> 52:22.320
this is for your ASMR triggers,

52:22.960 --> 52:25.600
the sound of my brother googling beaver anus.

52:25.600 --> 52:28.480
I'm doing it quietly on my phone, thank you very much.

52:28.480 --> 52:29.040
Oh, huh.

52:29.600 --> 52:30.320
Hey, cool.

52:31.120 --> 52:31.840
Yeah, I guess so.

52:32.480 --> 52:36.000
So I guess anything that you eat that has flavor in it,

52:37.440 --> 52:42.080
you're doing a little, you're just eating ass.

52:44.320 --> 52:45.920
You thought I was lying, didn't you?

52:45.920 --> 52:47.280
You thought I was wrong.

52:47.280 --> 52:48.560
I don't know what I thought.

52:49.920 --> 52:50.400
All right.

52:51.520 --> 52:52.560
Wow, yeah, look at that.

52:53.600 --> 52:53.920
Why?

52:53.920 --> 52:55.600
Why, is it good?

52:56.560 --> 52:57.840
Who discovered this?

52:57.840 --> 52:58.960
That's what I need to know.

52:58.960 --> 53:01.920
Who's like, that's actually, I wanted to eat,

53:01.920 --> 53:04.000
I said I would eat the entire beaver on a dare,

53:04.560 --> 53:07.120
but I'm enjoying the ass more than I thought I would.

53:07.120 --> 53:10.160
I just happened to have on my desk

53:10.160 --> 53:11.600
that I've been snacking on a little bit,

53:11.600 --> 53:12.400
some jelly beans.

53:13.360 --> 53:16.800
Those are going right in the fucking garbage can.

53:16.800 --> 53:18.480
Is beaver anus in jelly bellies?

53:19.040 --> 53:20.000
It's in Haribo.

53:20.560 --> 53:21.280
I think I'm okay.

53:21.280 --> 53:22.800
Okay.

53:22.800 --> 53:28.480
Oh, jelly beans have a shellac on them

53:28.480 --> 53:30.800
that is made from the secretions of a bug.

53:31.360 --> 53:32.240
Okay.

53:32.240 --> 53:33.520
A bee, a beeswax?

53:35.920 --> 53:36.240
No.

53:36.880 --> 53:40.960
If you see an ingredient titled confectioner's glaze,

53:42.800 --> 53:43.840
see if that's on your jelly beans.

53:43.840 --> 53:44.960
It's in there, yeah, they do.

53:48.160 --> 53:51.120
I mean, I'd rather eat bugs than eat out a beaver's butt.

53:51.120 --> 53:54.720
I don't know them.

53:54.720 --> 53:55.360
You know what I mean?

53:56.480 --> 53:58.000
How come it's just beavers?

53:58.000 --> 54:01.360
How come God gave the beaver the most flavorful butt glands?

54:02.160 --> 54:02.720
I don't know.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.040
Here we are.

54:05.040 --> 54:05.600
Here we are.

54:06.640 --> 54:08.640
Well, in this truth all together.

54:08.640 --> 54:12.160
This is the worst episode that we've put out so far.

54:12.720 --> 54:15.440
Just because of the truths contained within?

54:15.440 --> 54:17.040
I mean, I think all around,

54:17.040 --> 54:18.720
I don't think there's anything redemptive

54:18.720 --> 54:20.400
about what happened before this.

54:20.400 --> 54:22.640
Like everything we said in the episode

54:22.640 --> 54:24.720
doesn't balance out the whole beaver butt thing.

54:24.720 --> 54:26.240
No, God no, Christ no.

54:26.240 --> 54:27.680
No, I mean, we would have to give out

54:27.680 --> 54:29.280
the winning lotto ticket numbers or something.

54:29.280 --> 54:30.160
Okay, this is the thing.

54:30.160 --> 54:33.200
There's a food dye in Nerds

54:33.200 --> 54:35.280
that's made from crushed and boiled beetles.

54:35.840 --> 54:36.320
Yeah.

54:36.320 --> 54:36.880
Sure.

54:36.880 --> 54:37.760
All right.

54:37.760 --> 54:40.720
So we're all fucking nasty, nasty Timon and Pumbaa.

54:40.720 --> 54:43.520
Let's end it, the show and episode.

54:43.520 --> 54:45.840
Now to be fair, Griffin, you have numerous times said

54:45.840 --> 54:48.000
that Timon and Pumbaa made you want to eat those beetles.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.440
You want to eat those bugs.

54:49.440 --> 54:51.840
Yeah, well, now you've got the opportunity, thanks to Nerds.

54:51.840 --> 54:55.600
But I want to be able to give consent to Timon and Pumbaa

54:55.600 --> 54:56.640
before I eat the bugs.

54:56.640 --> 54:57.840
I don't want them tricking me.

54:59.360 --> 55:00.960
Yeah, not like, yeah.

55:01.600 --> 55:02.960
You gotta watch this, too.

55:02.960 --> 55:04.560
Try this, Simba.

55:04.560 --> 55:05.760
It's beaver ass.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.080
It's beaver ass.

55:08.080 --> 55:10.720
It's the one thing we love out here on the savanna.

55:11.600 --> 55:12.560
Beaver ass.

55:13.680 --> 55:14.800
Hakuna my ass.

55:16.320 --> 55:16.960
Delicious.

55:16.960 --> 55:20.080
Uh, I think I'm going to go back and deal with Scar.

55:21.040 --> 55:24.240
No, he won't have you anymore.

55:24.240 --> 55:25.200
You've been sullied.

55:26.240 --> 55:26.720
You better eat this.

55:26.720 --> 55:27.680
He'll know you ate the ass.

55:28.320 --> 55:28.960
He'll know.

55:28.960 --> 55:30.720
If you go back, we're going to tell everybody

55:30.720 --> 55:32.160
you ate the ass and loved it.

55:32.160 --> 55:33.840
Beaver ass pancakes.

55:33.840 --> 55:35.280
Beaver ass tortillas.

55:35.280 --> 55:36.480
Beaver ass tacos.

55:36.480 --> 55:37.600
We got everything.

55:37.600 --> 55:40.320
Something smells like vanilla ice cream,

55:40.320 --> 55:44.080
which almost universally contains beaver ass.

55:45.280 --> 55:46.240
It's me, Scar.

55:46.240 --> 55:47.360
I ate the beaver ass.

55:49.440 --> 55:51.680
Mufasa's like, don't eat the beaver ass.

55:51.680 --> 55:53.120
I thought I told you.

55:53.120 --> 55:54.160
What, ghost dad?

55:54.160 --> 55:55.280
I've missed you so much.

55:55.280 --> 55:56.560
You come back to talk to me.

55:56.560 --> 55:58.640
I told you to never eat beaver ass.

55:58.640 --> 55:59.600
I reject you.

56:00.160 --> 56:02.400
I can no longer recognize you as my heir.

56:02.400 --> 56:04.480
Just want back to say I'm disappointed.

56:05.680 --> 56:06.480
Anyway, bye.

56:07.760 --> 56:08.880
Hi, it's me, the beaver.

56:08.880 --> 56:10.400
I'm up here with your dad,

56:10.400 --> 56:12.400
and I can't believe you ate my ass.

56:12.400 --> 56:13.840
I'm dead and you ate my ass.

56:15.360 --> 56:16.000
The king.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.280
You're no king.

56:19.840 --> 56:22.240
That's what Rafiki is wiping on him, by the way,

56:22.240 --> 56:23.760
just in case anyone was wondering.

56:23.760 --> 56:26.080
It's a mixture of beetles and beaver ass.

56:26.080 --> 56:27.280
You're nasty.

56:29.280 --> 56:30.080
Go out into the world.

56:33.680 --> 56:35.680
This is Scar's entire plan,

56:35.680 --> 56:38.400
is to trick Simba into eating beaver ass

56:38.400 --> 56:39.920
and then tell everybody,

56:39.920 --> 56:41.520
well, it looks like you've beaten me,

56:41.520 --> 56:43.520
but before I surrender,

56:43.520 --> 56:45.360
just one more thing.

56:45.360 --> 56:46.560
Just one more thing.

56:48.400 --> 56:50.240
Yes, I told all the giraffes

56:50.240 --> 56:52.720
that you ate beaver ass and also geese.

56:53.360 --> 56:54.240
They know now,

56:54.240 --> 56:56.560
and the beavers were not thrilled.

56:56.560 --> 56:57.360
Let me tell you.

56:59.360 --> 57:00.640
Well, some of them were,

57:00.640 --> 57:02.720
but you don't know how they are.

57:03.520 --> 57:06.240
Some of them are extremely flexible

57:06.240 --> 57:08.560
on a moral spectrum.

57:09.680 --> 57:10.800
Thank you for listening

57:10.800 --> 57:16.400
to what is presumably not been canceled, a podcast by us,

57:16.400 --> 57:18.320
the McElroy brothers called My Brother, My Brother, Me.

57:18.320 --> 57:19.920
We hope you have enjoyed your time with us

57:20.960 --> 57:22.640
as we continue to soldier on

57:22.640 --> 57:27.440
through this absolutely bizarre period in our planet.

57:30.080 --> 57:33.040
We wrote a book about how to podcast.

57:33.040 --> 57:35.120
It is like a guide that will actually

57:35.120 --> 57:36.480
walk you through step by step,

57:36.480 --> 57:39.440
but we wrote it, so it's also kind of funny.

57:39.440 --> 57:41.040
I think you'll like reading it.

57:41.040 --> 57:42.720
Hey, I'll say it.

57:42.720 --> 57:44.080
You will like reading it.

57:44.080 --> 57:47.280
You can pre-order it at McElroyPodcastBook.com.

57:48.320 --> 57:49.360
What are you waiting for?

57:49.360 --> 57:50.160
Go do that.

57:51.360 --> 57:52.320
Let's see, what else?

57:52.320 --> 57:54.000
Thank you to John Roderick in the Long Winters

57:54.000 --> 57:54.800
for the use of our theme song

57:54.800 --> 57:55.760
as a departure off the album,

57:55.760 --> 57:57.280
Putting the Days to Bed.

57:57.280 --> 57:59.440
You can find that on the internet

58:00.400 --> 58:02.240
and a bunch of different places, I bet.

58:02.240 --> 58:04.320
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

58:04.320 --> 58:05.280
Go to MaximumFun.org,

58:05.280 --> 58:06.480
check out all the great shows there,

58:06.480 --> 58:08.000
shows like Stop Podcasting Yourself.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.040
And Heat Rocks, and a whole bunch more.

58:11.040 --> 58:12.800
All at MaximumFun.org.

58:12.800 --> 58:15.760
Also, we got some good new merch up

58:15.760 --> 58:19.120
there at the McElroyMerch.com store,

58:19.120 --> 58:22.080
including some bee pins that represent the three of us

58:22.080 --> 58:24.720
and our dad as a horrible bee monster.

58:24.720 --> 58:26.000
So make sure you check that out.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Don't forget to get registered to vote

58:28.000 --> 58:29.360
and vote early.

58:29.360 --> 58:32.880
And make sure you do some research on local elections

58:32.880 --> 58:36.160
because it starts local, then moves up the chain.

58:36.160 --> 58:40.320
Plus there's a lot of Senate seats up for grabs

58:40.320 --> 58:42.480
and then vote for Joe Biden.

58:42.480 --> 58:43.600
Thank you for being here.

58:43.600 --> 58:45.280
We hope you're hanging in there doing okay.

58:45.280 --> 58:47.040
Don't forget artists.

58:47.040 --> 58:48.000
I will use the teeth.

58:49.200 --> 58:51.200
Teeth owner, get at us.

58:51.200 --> 58:53.200
This final Yahoo.

58:53.200 --> 58:55.440
We're not narcs, this isn't a sting.

58:55.440 --> 58:58.720
No, it would be a very weird roundabout sting if it was.

58:58.720 --> 59:00.160
This one was sent in by the wizard Emma Cant.

59:00.160 --> 59:01.920
Thank you Emma, it's Yahoo Answers user.

59:01.920 --> 59:02.800
Another anonymous one,

59:02.800 --> 59:06.400
stop being so fucking scared and do and stand up for yourself

59:06.400 --> 59:07.200
for once.

59:09.200 --> 59:11.200
Billup asks,

59:12.960 --> 59:17.600
does anyone really believe it's a coincidence

59:17.600 --> 59:21.120
that the two surviving beetles are the circumcised one?

59:21.120 --> 59:29.040
I could not have for money told you where that was going.

59:29.040 --> 59:30.080
My name is Justin.

59:30.080 --> 59:33.840
Hi Travis, I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:33.840 --> 59:34.960
This has been My Brother, My Brother,

59:34.960 --> 59:36.800
may kiss your dad's square in the lips.

59:36.800 --> 01:00:00.880
Hey girls, do you wanna just say that I wanna?
