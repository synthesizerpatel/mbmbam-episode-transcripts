00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:44.400
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.760
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother on brother mean advice show for the modern era.

00:47.760 --> 00:51.360
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother,

00:51.360 --> 00:58.160
old thang zine Travis McElroy. Zip zoop, I'm future Griffin McElroy,

00:58.160 --> 01:01.360
and I've got android tubes coming out of the whole wazoo.

01:01.360 --> 01:07.360
Now, okay Griffin, we're recording this way in advance. Aren't you past Griffin?

01:08.000 --> 01:12.080
Okay, we're recording this in 2019 when it comes out in 2020. I'm assuming

01:12.080 --> 01:14.960
by the time, what is this like January 6th? Oops.

01:16.240 --> 01:19.440
Oh, that was part of Griffin's robot parts. That was a phone call that was coming out

01:19.440 --> 01:23.920
of my chest. I assume by 2020 when this one comes out I'm gonna have tubes.

01:23.920 --> 01:25.840
Yeah. Gonna be tubing.

01:25.840 --> 01:30.080
Tubes. I just wanna say something. This is the time of year. It's the magical time of year where

01:30.080 --> 01:36.800
we brand the new year and set a tone for the whole year, and everyone knows 2019 was 20 Frankenstein

01:36.800 --> 01:42.080
teen become the monster, but let me just say, hey, this is Travis saying, you guys, you may not

01:42.080 --> 01:49.200
realize it, but I kinda won because I hard pitched 20 equine teen this year were getting a horse,

01:49.200 --> 01:51.920
and let me check the books. Oh, yeah.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.640
We got a horse named Worldwide Webster, so.

01:54.640 --> 02:00.080
Yeah, I don't know how much monster morphing I'd really, if I'm being honest,

02:00.080 --> 02:03.600
if I'm really debriefing. It's good to be honest with yourself. I feel like

02:04.320 --> 02:12.000
I didn't, my wife got me a bidet for Christmas. That's as close as I got to becoming the monster,

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
and I do feel like in a way, you know, okay.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.920
Creature from the brown lagoon, go on.

02:17.920 --> 02:24.240
I'm gonna say it's just like becoming the monster, if you think about it, it's a wonderful life.

02:25.440 --> 02:32.880
That fool didn't, there's no way that he had a bidet, that super nice guy in it. He did not

02:32.880 --> 02:34.800
have a bidet. But Mr. Potter had eight bidets.

02:34.800 --> 02:40.400
Mr. Potter garun fucking teed. His whole seat was a bidet.

02:40.400 --> 02:46.000
His whole thing's a bidet. Guaranteed that guy had a bidet. So on that sliding scale

02:46.000 --> 02:50.960
between Mr. Potter and George Bailey, I definitely moved away from George Bailey

02:50.960 --> 02:53.680
when my lovely wife got me a bidet for Christmas.

02:53.680 --> 02:58.000
See, I would say I definitely became the monster because I put on 120 pounds of muscle.

03:00.240 --> 03:06.080
And I'm six foot seven now. So that part of it, for sure.

03:06.080 --> 03:10.640
I mean, I got a genuine internet vampire blood transfusion that I did buy on Etsy.

03:10.640 --> 03:15.440
Yeah, that's for sure. Hey Griffin, you look great. Very pale and sparkly.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.320
Yeah, you know, and I'll have to take your fucking word for it, won't I?

03:19.520 --> 03:21.280
No more mirrors. Can't see in the mirrors.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.040
Can't see in the mirror. So I've put a lot of thought into 2020. What about you, Griffin?

03:29.040 --> 03:36.080
You know, I've got, no, I've been making it up sort of for the last three minutes and 40 seconds.

03:36.080 --> 03:40.000
Oh my God, really? I've been working on this list for four months. What about you, Justin?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.840
Yeah, absolutely. I've been working on it.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.680
I know you haven't, Justin, because you told us before we started recording, you forgot.

03:45.680 --> 03:51.840
It didn't, not that I forget. We didn't plan on this being this episode until it was.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.000
I've planned on it this whole time.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.920
Okay, listen, listen, listen. We got 2010 was Zolo.

03:57.920 --> 03:58.240
Right.

03:58.880 --> 03:59.840
What did that mean?

04:00.640 --> 04:01.440
Don't know.

04:01.440 --> 04:01.920
Don't know.

04:01.920 --> 04:08.880
Was it like a YOLO thing? It was 10 calendar years ago. No one can remember.

04:08.880 --> 04:12.320
Correct. This will be our 10th anniversary. Maybe there's something there.

04:12.320 --> 04:17.040
Now, I was thinking Zozo, but that's the that's the terrifying.

04:17.040 --> 04:20.480
God, this is the 10th one of these we've done. Oh my God.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.800
Now, what was 2011?

04:23.440 --> 04:24.480
2011 was...

04:24.480 --> 04:28.320
11th. Excuse me, this is the 11th one of these that we have done.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.760
Holy shit. Okay, I have the wiki pulled up. Let's just blaze through.

04:31.760 --> 04:32.400
Okay, go for it.

04:32.400 --> 04:37.760
Zolo. That was less official. So this could be our official 10th year theme.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.960
2011, 2000 in heaven, get right with Christ.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.680
Okay, that's a good one.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.520
Interesting start that we had there.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.960
2012 was getting it in 20 does.

04:48.960 --> 04:49.840
20 does, yes.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.840
20 does, getting it in 20 does.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.280
2013 was 2013, dig it up, get it out.

04:55.280 --> 04:55.520
Yeah.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.600
I should just be laughing at the dumb shit we said eight years ago, but here we are.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.320
20 forward. That was a powerful one.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.800
That was a good one. Move the chains.

05:04.800 --> 05:09.760
2015, 2015, the con is on.

05:09.760 --> 05:10.160
Follow that one.

05:10.160 --> 05:13.600
You got to get the subtitles. It's so important for your years to have subtitles.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.240
That's true.

05:14.960 --> 05:18.640
Then we had 2016, building bridges, our biggest whiff.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.240
Our biggest stupid loony.

05:20.240 --> 05:21.600
Oh, that one.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.000
2017, very powerful.

05:24.880 --> 05:28.400
20 serpentine, keep them guessing, or zag on them if you prefer.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.560
Then we had collaborate teen, stronger together.

05:32.560 --> 05:33.680
That was a powerful year.

05:33.680 --> 05:38.000
20, and then lastly, Frankenstein teen, become the monster.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.840
Yes, which I nailed.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.720
And I've seen a lot of buzz on the forums.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.160
What will it be?

05:46.160 --> 05:48.160
What variety printed a story about it?

05:48.160 --> 05:48.720
What will it be?

05:48.720 --> 05:50.560
New York Times printed a story about it.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.200
They wrote it in a new chapter in the Bible.

05:53.200 --> 05:57.200
And a lot of people have been guessing it's going to be just something about 2020,

05:58.480 --> 06:01.600
see clearly, or 2020, a look back, or something like that.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.800
That's basic. That's fucking basic.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.160
We are not looking back.

06:07.360 --> 06:11.760
The subtitle for this year needs to be whatever the opposite of looking back is,

06:11.760 --> 06:13.120
which I guess is looking forward.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.560
And I think we've done that one already.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.280
So nevermind.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.560
Look, can I pitch one?

06:16.560 --> 06:17.920
And I've learned from the past.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.520
I'm going to say my favorite one.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.320
Travis, can I just say, you are juiced right now.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.360
I'm excited.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.760
Fewer good rhymes, I will say, for this year.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.920
Well, teen, we had an abundance of riches.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.400
Well, now stick with me here.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.880
You're going to see where I'm going with this one.

06:32.880 --> 06:35.600
But 20 bunny, hop to it.

06:35.600 --> 06:35.920
All right.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.160
So you know that's not good, but it's good to get like a-

06:38.160 --> 06:39.840
Right, I'm trying to get the ball rolling.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.520
You got to fire all the blanks out of the cartridge.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.520
20 bunny, hop to it.

06:44.080 --> 06:44.800
Yeah, yeah.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.000
So that one's gone.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.160
20 hunty, go get it.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.320
Hunty, like you're hunting.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.520
Well, this is interesting.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.720
Maybe this is the year, and I like it.

06:56.720 --> 07:00.240
You know my shit is like practical, get out there.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.440
Like add a direction, an instruction

07:03.440 --> 07:04.800
for our listeners to follow.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.600
And I think let's all get into hunting this year.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.040
Yeah, that's a weird energy.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.840
That is a weird energy, but only for population control.

07:11.840 --> 07:12.800
Let's be clear.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.480
This is not big game hunting.

07:14.480 --> 07:17.440
This is not, oh God, no, that's disgusting.

07:17.440 --> 07:21.040
This is for food and for population control.

07:21.040 --> 07:21.760
That's it.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.680
We're talking about sewer pigs.

07:23.680 --> 07:24.180
Yeah.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.880
I want to hit you guys with one, okay?

07:27.760 --> 07:30.160
Okay, we're not, who's writing these down?

07:30.160 --> 07:31.040
Griffin, you have to write them down

07:31.040 --> 07:33.360
since you didn't prepare as many as me and Travis did.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.720
Or was that a bit?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.160
Do I have to write down 20 bunny?

07:36.160 --> 07:36.800
No, it's a thing.

07:36.800 --> 07:37.920
No, 20 bunny's out.

07:37.920 --> 07:38.420
Okay.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.440
Make a shared document, please.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.200
Oh my God, I didn't realize we were gonna get fucking-

07:43.200 --> 07:45.280
This is our advice show, by the way.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.960
And every year we pick a new year theme.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.080
Welcome to your first episode

07:48.080 --> 07:49.680
if you're just now listening, I'm sorry.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.520
You should not, let's start with this one, honestly.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.680
No, this is gonna set the tone for your whole year.

07:53.680 --> 07:58.000
Work space, this is scratch paper of an episode.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.680
Listen, let me hit you with this.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.440
20 binti, living large.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.240
20 binti, like a-

08:06.240 --> 08:07.440
Like a venti.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.680
Like a venti, 20 venti, living large.

08:09.680 --> 08:10.560
Because it's 20.

08:11.840 --> 08:15.120
20 venti, living large.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.840
Huh, venti rhymes with 20.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.440
20 venti, living large.

08:19.440 --> 08:22.800
Well, hold on, you just said it and so you know it doesn't.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.880
And you also, you keep saying venti.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.200
20, yes, that's as close as we're gonna get.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.880
Okay, okay, I feel like I should-

08:30.880 --> 08:33.680
20 venti, living large.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.400
That's not bad.

08:36.480 --> 08:37.280
Can you play in it?

08:39.280 --> 08:41.920
Can you just get on top of it for a second?

08:41.920 --> 08:43.040
Take it around the track.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.960
20 venti, don't be a drip.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.880
Oh, that's not bad.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.640
I'm gonna write that down.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.080
Okay, really?

08:50.720 --> 08:52.560
Weird, kind of a play on mine.

08:52.560 --> 08:53.680
Yeah, I remixed it a little bit.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.880
20 venti, don't talk to me before I've had my coffee.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.080
That's fun too.

08:58.720 --> 08:59.920
It's attainable at least.

08:59.920 --> 09:00.320
Yeah.

09:00.320 --> 09:01.840
We're just all not gonna talk to each other

09:01.840 --> 09:02.320
until we've had our coffee.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.120
Let's just not.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.040
We need to be careful here.

09:05.040 --> 09:05.360
Okay.

09:05.360 --> 09:10.800
Because we are stumbling in the direction of just sort of a bad like slant rhyme.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.960
Like 20 plenty can't be it, right?

09:14.960 --> 09:18.080
Well, we went with Frankenstein Teen, Griffin.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.200
Yeah, there's, listen, it's gonna be a slant rhyme, bud.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.160
There's nothing else.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.880
There's nothing that rhymes with 20?

09:24.880 --> 09:26.080
No, nothing.

09:26.080 --> 09:29.120
Well, can I, hunty did.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.880
I'm just saying, hunty did.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.040
Well, I can say a lot of different sounds.

09:33.040 --> 09:33.200
Yeah.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.560
That doesn't make them English words.

09:34.560 --> 09:38.080
Well, look, I wanna now throw out the one that I think is a real contender.

09:38.080 --> 09:38.480
Okay.

09:38.480 --> 09:42.720
I'm really proud of that I wanna throw out here now right in the middle so it sticks.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.240
20 honey down to bee'sness.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.480
And now here's the thing about it.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.080
It's about getting down to business, which is important.

09:52.080 --> 09:52.960
And also.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.680
Saving the bees.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.480
Bees.

09:54.480 --> 09:54.800
Yeah.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.880
20 honey, H-U-N-N-Y.

09:56.880 --> 09:57.680
20 honey.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.360
Oh, wait, you're spelling it like a poo bear.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.880
Yeah, 20 honey.

10:00.880 --> 10:01.920
The poo spelling.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.320
Yes, 20 honey down to bee'sness.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.600
Down to bee'sness.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.960
Travis, that's really good, bud.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.640
I was starting to think that after 20 honey, hunty.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.680
See, you've just kind of taken 20 hunty and sort of-

10:13.680 --> 10:14.640
But I made it better.

10:14.640 --> 10:14.880
Made it far more.

10:14.880 --> 10:18.080
Because you gotta say it like this, 20 honey down to bee'sness.

10:18.880 --> 10:21.280
I am, this is the best one so far, obviously.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.320
And here, let me also just say, a lot of my choices were influenced.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.440
A lot of this is to blame on Paul Sabourin.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.440
Because Paul got us-

10:29.440 --> 10:29.920
Paul.

10:29.920 --> 10:34.160
He got us a gobo for our tours.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.200
So that behind all of our tours this year, it said, become the monster.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.040
And that was very exciting to me.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.800
And we branded our tours a lot this way.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.400
So this year I thought, well, it'll be a fun branding for our tours.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.760
Because they will also be on the posters.

10:45.760 --> 10:46.880
It'll be on the gobos behind us.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.000
And I thought, you know what I like?

10:48.560 --> 10:49.200
Bees.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.960
And bee iconography.

10:50.960 --> 10:55.920
There's no spelling of the word bee'sness that looks like fucking anything.

10:55.920 --> 11:01.120
B-E-E-S dash N-E-S-S.

11:01.120 --> 11:01.920
Already a plus.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.000
Just an embarrassment of E's in this one.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.920
20 honey down to bee'sness.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.040
I don't think it's a type of phrase.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.160
We can't make merch out of it.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.240
Because this phrase can never be written down.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.000
And must only be spoken.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.840
Yeah, legibility is not its strong suit.

11:19.840 --> 11:25.600
But if Travis is inventing words, I'm gonna, let me pitch this one.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.400
20 bunty, just get on base.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.520
20 bunny, bunty.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.480
No, how about this?

11:32.480 --> 11:35.760
20 bunty, just get on base.

11:35.760 --> 11:38.320
May I just pop the bat out in front?

11:38.320 --> 11:40.480
Get on this one for a second, Travis.

11:40.480 --> 11:43.680
I'm gonna tweet, Travis, can you stop and play in the baseball diamond?

11:43.680 --> 11:44.640
I am going to play in it.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.520
I'm going to play by tweaking the subtitle a little bit.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.360
Well, but can you just try mine?

11:49.360 --> 11:50.240
Yes, but it's the same.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.720
Okay, just get on base.

11:52.720 --> 11:55.120
That sounds defeatist, if I may.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.560
It sounds attainable, but go on.

11:56.560 --> 11:59.200
Okay, 20 bunty, advance the runners.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.280
Right, now this is, you're gonna sacrifice the out.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.800
But you're gonna advance the runners.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.680
You know, maybe you're getting someone home.

12:07.680 --> 12:12.400
This is a motto where you say sacrifice yourself for the good of others.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.720
Listen, yeah, yeah.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.720
20 bunty, advance the runners.

12:16.720 --> 12:20.800
20 bunty is probably more powerful than advance, yes.

12:20.800 --> 12:26.320
20 bunty is probably, advance the runners is probably more, that is, okay.

12:26.320 --> 12:29.840
That's the one to write down, Griffin, to chip into the tablet.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.320
20 bunty, here's, okay.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.000
I'm gonna have to lay down the law here.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And this is gonna be helpful for us moving forward,

12:36.000 --> 12:40.080
because there's an infinite number of bad rhymes we can generate here.

12:40.080 --> 12:44.160
The second word cannot have a hard T in it.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.520
Because having to say 20 bunty is wild and impossible.

12:47.520 --> 12:50.480
I like it, the way you said it, that made me very happy.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.400
What about just 20 funny, maybe this year?

12:55.440 --> 12:57.520
And that's a personal one, that's for us.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.760
Maybe this year will be funny?

12:59.760 --> 13:00.480
Yeah.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.440
What about 20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love?

13:03.440 --> 13:18.080
That one's so wholesome, that one is so, that sounds like it leered straight

13:18.080 --> 13:20.080
from the Growing Beans theme song.

13:20.080 --> 13:24.400
It sounds like, it's so attainable.

13:24.400 --> 13:28.160
The idea of us having to say that a lot this year.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.520
Say it one more time, Griffin.

13:29.520 --> 13:32.080
20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love.

13:32.080 --> 13:35.520
Now how is that more attainable than Advanced to Runners?

13:35.520 --> 13:38.400
That seems the least attainable, that's so ephemeral.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.000
But have you guys all said it yet?

13:40.000 --> 13:45.680
Because it's 20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love.

13:45.680 --> 13:48.320
So this is gonna be the, so when people come to see us,

13:48.320 --> 13:51.040
it'll be for the fill your life with laughter and love tour.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.360
Yes guys, are you hearing yourself?

13:55.360 --> 13:58.240
You need to close your eyes and generate a stage,

13:58.240 --> 14:00.800
and then flash that gobo up on it.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.600
Okay.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.960
Holy fucking shit.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.120
Okay, how about this?

14:05.120 --> 14:07.440
If we wanna go a little more attainable,

14:07.440 --> 14:09.520
not more attainable, but maybe more concrete,

14:10.640 --> 14:12.880
20 Penny, get rid of it.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.960
Did you say pity or penny?

14:16.960 --> 14:19.760
Penny, this is the year that we get rid of the penny.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.360
20 Penny sent to heaven.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.520
Sent to heaven is cool.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.160
C-E-N-T, you say.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.360
Yeah dude, that's cool.

14:29.360 --> 14:33.600
Yeah, 20 Penny sent to heaven, or sent to hell.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.520
But I like to think the penny's put in its work,

14:35.520 --> 14:37.200
it gets to ascend to its great reward.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.520
It used to be able to buy shit with it.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.280
I don't think its irrelevance makes it.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.280
There's a whole kind of candy named after

14:43.280 --> 14:44.640
how you used to be able to spend it on it.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.840
And an ante.

14:45.840 --> 14:46.340
Yeah.

14:48.080 --> 14:51.600
I don't think we have in our ability to get rid of-

14:51.600 --> 14:54.160
The penny, a form of US currency.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.880
What about 20 money?

14:56.880 --> 14:59.840
Ben basically kept Hamilton on the $10 bill,

14:59.840 --> 15:01.200
so he knows the people.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.040
He used it up, everybody gets-

15:03.040 --> 15:04.880
He burned it, he wasted it.

15:04.880 --> 15:07.040
When he could've been sending pennies to hell.

15:07.040 --> 15:07.520
Right.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.200
20 money, get that paper.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.960
Or here's an opportunity that this year,

15:12.960 --> 15:17.040
and as far as I'm aware, only this year is gonna provide us,

15:17.040 --> 15:19.600
unless we live to 30-30, which is-

15:20.240 --> 15:20.720
Possible.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.680
It's possible, is that it's the same.

15:23.680 --> 15:24.880
Uh-huh.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.720
So it could be just like 20-20, repeat.

15:29.520 --> 15:33.840
No, it could be money-money, Papa wants it, Papa gets it.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.520
Something along those lines.

15:35.520 --> 15:35.840
Oh, okay.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.240
Money-money, get that paper.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.920
Honey-money, down to bee'sness.

15:40.720 --> 15:41.200
Honey-

15:41.200 --> 15:44.560
Okay, you seem to have perverted this fine idea.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.600
So now we get business and bees both in there.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.880
Honey-money, down to bee'sness.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.280
I'll write that down, Travis, but I'm not loving it.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.960
That's fine, that's fine.

15:54.960 --> 15:55.680
That's fine.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.920
Bunny-money, get some carrots.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.760
It's important for you guys to get in this doc with me,

16:01.760 --> 16:03.520
because seeing it all written down is-

16:05.120 --> 16:06.080
Where is it, where's the link?

16:06.080 --> 16:08.880
I've shared it, I've shared it, check your emails.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.000
Oh, in the emails, okay.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.560
The Network, Green Day Side Project,

16:12.560 --> 16:15.600
the Network had one album called Money Money 2020.

16:15.600 --> 16:15.920
Uh-huh.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.960
Okay, did you just Google that just to make sure it was-

16:18.960 --> 16:21.600
No, I remembered the name, I didn't remember the name of the album,

16:21.600 --> 16:24.480
but I've heard somebody say Money Money 2020 before.

16:24.480 --> 16:28.000
You've put 20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love,

16:28.560 --> 16:32.320
in a special font and font size,

16:32.320 --> 16:36.240
which feels unfair to 20 honey, down to bee'sness,

16:36.240 --> 16:38.320
which I feel they're tied right now.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.000
You're right, they are tied right now.

16:40.000 --> 16:40.720
You're right, Travis.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.880
I'm gonna give that one the special treatment as well,

16:42.880 --> 16:44.880
so don't worry about a thing.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.640
Well, you put it in Comic Sans and then you made it small.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.920
Aww.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.680
This is an abuse of power.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.320
Now what if, what if, Griffin, may I?

16:54.960 --> 16:59.280
What if it was honey funny, fill your life with laughter and bees?

17:01.120 --> 17:01.920
It's interesting.

17:02.720 --> 17:06.000
Huh, that's interesting, fill your bees with laughter and love.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.200
Ooh, I like that too.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.840
That's going somewhere.

17:09.840 --> 17:14.720
Okay, so I think we're on funny honey.

17:15.840 --> 17:17.120
Fill your bees with laughter, no.

17:17.840 --> 17:19.200
Okay, we're spiraling.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.440
I don't think you can just say no, Griffin.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.720
I think you have to put it in there.

17:22.720 --> 17:25.600
Okay, we need more content.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.760
Right now we're trying to bake a pizza

17:27.760 --> 17:31.440
and we have three ingredients and one of them is an eraser.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.760
We need more ingredients in here to make this tasty pizza with.

17:36.400 --> 17:42.000
Okay, has anybody ever said blinny as a short way of saying blender?

17:42.000 --> 17:42.560
No.

17:42.560 --> 17:42.880
No.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.240
Okay, I resent.

17:44.240 --> 17:51.440
I don't have anything at the moment.

17:51.440 --> 17:51.760
All right.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.440
Please, please return to me.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.240
I cede my turn to the next contestant.

17:56.240 --> 17:59.280
We open the floor to rhymezone.com.

17:59.280 --> 18:02.320
Now, yes, I have turned to RhymeZone myself.

18:02.320 --> 18:02.800
I see.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.800
I too have been at RhymeZone for some time.

18:06.800 --> 18:12.320
Now they do, it's interesting, blood money, bloody money.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.440
No, that's nothing.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.720
No, I don't think so.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.240
How about 20 runny?

18:19.920 --> 18:21.760
There's a word called intente

18:22.480 --> 18:25.200
and it's a friendly understanding between political power.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.040
So I'm gonna put that one right back in the toilet.

18:27.040 --> 18:27.840
It climbed out of.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.480
How about 20 Ginny?

18:30.480 --> 18:32.080
It's your year, Jennifer.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.920
Hey, this one's cool for Jennifer's.

18:33.920 --> 18:37.760
It's targeted at Jennifer's, but like they'll love it, right?

18:37.760 --> 18:39.920
Well, if we're going there about just like 20 Dougie.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.720
That one doesn't rhyme and mine did.

18:42.720 --> 18:47.120
No, 20 Ginny, you can hear that does it.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.600
I mean, they both end in me, I guess.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.600
There's a lot of things that RhymeZone is telling me

18:51.600 --> 18:53.360
rhymes with 20 that, hey, RhymeZone,

18:54.080 --> 18:55.200
fully fucking doesn't rhyme.

18:56.240 --> 18:58.080
I think plenty and 20.

18:58.080 --> 18:58.960
20 and plenty.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.960
Nothing rhymes with the way humans say 20, right?

19:05.120 --> 19:08.720
Now I've just put in honey and found things that rhyme with that.

19:10.160 --> 19:12.160
One of the things is the knee.

19:12.160 --> 19:14.160
So what about 20 the knee?

19:14.160 --> 19:17.680
Where we all just focus on our knees and take care of it.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.040
That one doesn't rhyme, Travis.

19:19.040 --> 19:19.680
That one doesn't.

19:19.680 --> 19:20.480
No, this is good.

19:20.480 --> 19:21.600
20 the knee.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.600
I'm dissociating, this is the pits.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.120
Stop, listen, 20 the knee.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.720
Lift with your back just this year.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.640
And we're not doctors and you shouldn't listen to the shit we say,

19:34.640 --> 19:37.360
but like maybe give the knees a break.

19:37.360 --> 19:42.720
Your back's been living the fucking high life for too long.

19:42.720 --> 19:47.200
I'm feeling very strongly about funny honey.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.040
Fill your life with laughter and bees.

19:49.680 --> 19:55.120
I am feeling good about 20 Palminteri chazes to the front.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.680
Chazes to the front, party in the back.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.920
Palminteri isn't even the close.

20:02.480 --> 20:03.920
20 minty, freshen it up.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.280
20 minty.

20:05.280 --> 20:09.760
I'm trying to get in the place I was at when I said Frankenstein team

20:09.760 --> 20:12.080
because it was the kind of outside the bun.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.320
I think the place you're at was about 25 minutes in

20:14.320 --> 20:17.200
and we just wanted to do anything else if memory serves.

20:17.200 --> 20:20.640
And hey, let's just say we're there right now and we are only 20 minutes in.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.280
So each year we're getting a little bit faster to this point.

20:23.280 --> 20:27.600
Rhyme Zone has suggested that to rhyme with 20 is Allegheny.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.040
How do we feel about that?

20:29.040 --> 20:29.680
Or not?

20:29.680 --> 20:33.120
No, listen, I'm not going to rely on this crutch of Rhyme Zone anymore.

20:33.120 --> 20:33.760
Yeah.

20:33.760 --> 20:34.400
20.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.040
20.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.480
Let's look at our options so far.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.640
We may have a diamond in the rough.

20:38.640 --> 20:39.200
Yeah.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.040
Griffin, you've stopped writing them down, right?

20:41.040 --> 20:44.080
Because the last one you have here is Down to Beesness.

20:44.080 --> 20:48.080
No, Travis has added honey money down to Beesness.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.280
Now he's writing funny honey, fill your-

20:51.280 --> 20:53.200
Yeah, we know what the rest of the sentence is going to be.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.880
So I don't need to continue reading that.

20:55.840 --> 20:59.120
Funny honey, fill your life with laughter and bees.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.240
Okay, now hold on.

21:00.240 --> 21:03.920
I don't think it's good.

21:03.920 --> 21:05.680
I don't think it's good.

21:05.680 --> 21:06.960
Can I just say something?

21:06.960 --> 21:09.200
I feel very strongly about funny honey.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.800
But who's this knocking at the door?

21:10.800 --> 21:14.080
It's 20 Bunty wondering where his place at the table is.

21:14.080 --> 21:17.280
Well, 20 Bunty advanced the runners is pretty good.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.320
It is pretty good.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.880
Advance the bees with laughter and love.

21:22.400 --> 21:26.160
I feel like we have gotten away from subtitling a year

21:26.160 --> 21:29.840
and have entered a sort of fugue state of sounds.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.520
And ideas and thoughts and colors

21:32.560 --> 21:36.720
that aren't necessarily a coherent way of approaching a year.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.040
People rely on us for direction.

21:39.040 --> 21:42.720
But okay, funny honey, fill your life with laughter and bees

21:42.720 --> 21:46.000
are two, I think, attainable goals.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.160
Where do you find bees though, right?

21:48.160 --> 21:49.600
At the bee store.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.560
Okay, I'm not in a place in my life, Travis,

21:52.560 --> 21:55.680
where I can just have some bees.

21:55.680 --> 21:59.760
I'm barely holding it together myself.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.840
Yeah, you're gonna need to set up an aviary.

22:01.840 --> 22:04.960
This is true, but everyone knows you're gonna have to.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.480
Listen, the bees aren't gonna save themselves.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.240
I think we've all figured that out.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.760
They certainly, if they are,

22:11.760 --> 22:13.760
they're taking their sweet fucking time.

22:13.760 --> 22:14.960
So we need to save the bees.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.320
And you know what else they could save?

22:16.320 --> 22:17.200
Laughter.

22:17.200 --> 22:20.080
Okay, let's put bees in a box for just a second.

22:20.080 --> 22:22.000
No, unless there's vents.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
This, you know, it's dumb to have to say 22 times

22:27.600 --> 22:28.640
if you think about it.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.000
You're just repeating yourself.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.440
Let me pitch this to you.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.920
20, efficiency above all.

22:36.640 --> 22:41.360
I like the message, but I hate also the message,

22:41.360 --> 22:42.080
which is weird.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.400
What about 20 twice, one more again?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.080
20 twice.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.440
20 twice is interesting.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.720
20 twice, take a second.

22:55.520 --> 22:57.280
20 twice, second chance.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.200
20 twice, fill your life with laughter.

23:08.720 --> 23:12.080
20 twice feels so nice.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.600
Well, now that's just a rhyme

23:13.600 --> 23:16.640
and not so much a followable kind of command.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.480
20 twice, roll the dice.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.000
Roll the dice.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.880
What is the connection between this 20 twice,

23:24.880 --> 23:25.840
second chances?

23:27.200 --> 23:31.280
Or, 20 twice, roll the dice got such a baby response.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.400
Because it means nothing.

23:34.000 --> 23:34.800
There's no connection.

23:34.800 --> 23:35.920
It just rhymes.

23:35.920 --> 23:37.280
It means 2020.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.920
Yeah, buddy, fucking slurp it down, dog.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.120
What do you got?

23:43.120 --> 23:43.760
What you got?

23:44.960 --> 23:46.720
What are you fucking drinking though?

23:46.720 --> 23:48.320
I bet it's hardy.

23:48.320 --> 23:52.960
I bet it's hardy and rich, hardy fucking drink.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.560
The iced coffee you left here.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.600
Yeah, baby.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.240
Thanks for that.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.280
Yeah, you're welcome.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.520
20 twice, sugar and spice.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.880
Well, now you're just rhyming.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.080
No, because sugar and spice are two different things.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.880
20 twice, twice is nice.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.480
We'll just, I'll try harder.

24:08.480 --> 24:12.000
Well, but see, once again, twice is nice feels ephemeral.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.080
20 twice, let's all be nice.

24:14.800 --> 24:15.120
No.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.480
20, okay.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.760
We can't follow become the monster with let's now oops,

24:19.760 --> 24:21.200
let's all be nice.

24:21.200 --> 24:25.200
Okay, if we're gonna go 20 twice,

24:25.200 --> 24:28.080
I think it needs to be like 20 twice a second look

24:28.080 --> 24:29.920
or 20 twice second chances.

24:30.560 --> 24:31.200
Not powerful.

24:31.200 --> 24:31.760
Not powerful.

24:31.760 --> 24:35.440
I think I don't Brooke with second chances anymore.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.720
We all gotta get serious.

24:36.720 --> 24:41.840
Okay, 20 twice, two for the money.

24:43.360 --> 24:44.400
That doesn't mean anything.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.920
I know, but you were saying bullshit

24:45.920 --> 24:47.600
that didn't mean anything either and I laughed.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.280
Sugar and spice is good.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.960
But what does it mean?

24:50.960 --> 24:54.080
It means in moderation be sweet.

24:54.080 --> 24:54.880
Justin, I swear to God,

24:54.880 --> 24:55.920
if you delete 20 funny,

24:55.920 --> 24:57.600
fill your life with laughter and love.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.960
I was actually highlighting it

24:58.960 --> 25:00.160
because it's starting to come around.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.280
Yeah, Justin, have you actually,

25:01.280 --> 25:02.480
Justin, have you said it out loud?

25:02.480 --> 25:03.280
No, say it.

25:03.280 --> 25:03.840
Justin, say it.

25:03.840 --> 25:07.920
20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.040
Yeah, that one's good.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.520
20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.760
And the thing is, is it does what it says

25:13.760 --> 25:14.960
right there on the box.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.680
It's so valuable.

25:17.680 --> 25:20.640
I'm imagining the merch now.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.320
I'm imagining walking around

25:22.320 --> 25:24.800
with a fucking jacket on it

25:24.800 --> 25:28.400
and on the back it'd be like a cool tribal print.

25:28.400 --> 25:29.920
But it also says 20 funny,

25:29.920 --> 25:31.360
fill your life with laughter and love.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.080
I think it's the first one

25:34.080 --> 25:35.120
we've ever come up with

25:35.120 --> 25:37.680
that actually in saying it

25:37.680 --> 25:40.160
fills your life with laughter and love.

25:40.160 --> 25:45.120
It does, it fulfills the goal right there

25:45.120 --> 25:47.120
just by saying it out loud.

25:47.120 --> 25:51.120
Can we please, I'll do, I promise 2021,

25:51.120 --> 25:53.680
I'll bow out and you two can pick it

25:53.680 --> 25:55.680
and I won't get a vote.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.040
I am ready to relent.

25:57.040 --> 26:00.160
I am ready to grant this

26:00.160 --> 26:02.880
to 20 funny, fill your life with laughter.

26:02.880 --> 26:03.520
I will too.

26:04.080 --> 26:07.040
I can get through one time without saying it,

26:07.040 --> 26:08.000
without laughing, I mean.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I also will say though,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.080
if there's an underground contingent

26:12.080 --> 26:14.160
that wants to always say funny honey,

26:14.160 --> 26:15.520
fill your life with laughter and bees,

26:15.520 --> 26:16.560
that's up to you.

26:16.560 --> 26:17.760
I can't stop you from doing it.

26:17.760 --> 26:20.800
That's like the fucking Weird Al version of our theme.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.160
What you have to understand, Travis,

26:22.160 --> 26:23.440
is that you have,

26:23.440 --> 26:25.680
I don't want you to bastardize your art

26:25.680 --> 26:28.080
because 20 honey down to bee'sness

26:28.080 --> 26:30.000
is way better than that bullshit.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.800
You have made a pale mockery

26:32.800 --> 26:35.520
of 20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.040
20 honey down to bee'sness

26:37.040 --> 26:39.120
is its own thing.

26:39.120 --> 26:42.160
And if we're gonna have a shadow camp,

26:42.160 --> 26:43.040
I feel like it's got,

26:43.040 --> 26:44.720
I think 20 honey down to bee'sness.

26:44.720 --> 26:47.840
I just feel, I just like the phrase bee'sness.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.360
Oh, we all do, we all do.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.040
Okay, you can also,

26:51.040 --> 26:52.000
okay, so there it is.

26:52.000 --> 26:52.640
It's settled.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.080
20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.560
Head on over to mackleroymerch.com

26:58.560 --> 27:00.400
and get your 20 funny,

27:00.400 --> 27:01.920
fill your life with laughter and love.

27:01.920 --> 27:08.000
Swag.

27:16.320 --> 27:17.280
Hey, this is Griffin.

27:17.280 --> 27:18.560
I'm gonna do these ads myself

27:18.560 --> 27:21.280
because we recorded this one a long time ago

27:21.280 --> 27:22.400
and didn't do the ads then.

27:22.400 --> 27:23.680
So I'm gonna do them now

27:23.680 --> 27:25.440
and you're gonna hear them later

27:25.440 --> 27:26.560
because that's how time works.

27:26.560 --> 27:27.760
Here's one for Stitch Fix.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.600
They're the ones with the box of clothes

27:29.600 --> 27:30.800
that they send to your house

27:30.800 --> 27:34.000
and you try them on and you smell them,

27:34.000 --> 27:35.120
you huff them deeply.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.040
You have a personal stylist

27:37.040 --> 27:38.880
that you answer a few questions

27:38.880 --> 27:41.200
and then they will send you some clothes

27:41.200 --> 27:42.400
that's gonna match your body

27:42.400 --> 27:44.000
and your style and your fashions

27:44.640 --> 27:46.480
and shipping and exchanges and returns

27:46.480 --> 27:47.760
are always free

27:47.760 --> 27:50.480
and the $20 styling fee is automatically applies

27:50.480 --> 27:52.240
where it's anything you keep from your box.

27:53.120 --> 27:55.600
It's a great little box, folks.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.080
Not all boxes are full of fresh clothes.

27:58.080 --> 28:03.680
A lot of boxes are gonna have styrofoam in it

28:03.680 --> 28:06.160
or hey, here's a big box

28:06.160 --> 28:09.840
and this box is just full of printer paper

28:09.840 --> 28:10.960
and that's a bad box.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.160
Nobody wants that.

28:12.160 --> 28:13.760
This box has a fresh shirt in it

28:13.760 --> 28:15.120
and it's from Stitch Fix.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.800

29:56.400 --> 29:57.680
My spring semester of college

29:57.680 --> 29:58.800
is coming up in about a month

29:58.800 --> 30:00.240
I'm getting my textbooks

30:00.240 --> 30:01.680
all right we'll get off your back about it

30:02.320 --> 30:04.880
one of the textbooks is labeled as recommended

30:04.880 --> 30:06.160
rather than required

30:06.720 --> 30:08.880
should I buy the recommended textbook

30:10.880 --> 30:13.120
or do most people manage just fine without it

30:13.120 --> 30:14.080
you'll be okay

30:14.880 --> 30:16.720
I would really appreciate your advice

30:16.720 --> 30:17.520
happy new year

30:17.520 --> 30:19.600
that's from Alexis Ganner Wisconsin

30:19.600 --> 30:22.400
Alexis you have asked this question

30:22.400 --> 30:23.920
of a man who in college

30:23.920 --> 30:25.840
much to his shame and discredit

30:26.800 --> 30:28.800
went to the radio station our dad worked at

30:28.800 --> 30:31.440
and zero copied an entire biology textbook

30:32.480 --> 30:33.600
to keep from having

30:33.600 --> 30:35.440
and then returned it to the bookstore

30:35.440 --> 30:35.760
nice

30:35.760 --> 30:36.720
this is here

30:36.720 --> 30:37.920
this is the kind of people

30:37.920 --> 30:39.120
why would that be shameful

30:39.120 --> 30:39.760
that's great

30:40.480 --> 30:42.960
you know it's bad for somebody along the lines

30:42.960 --> 30:43.760
getting ripped off

30:44.320 --> 30:45.680
books are hard enough to write

30:45.680 --> 30:47.280
without somebody photocopying them

30:47.280 --> 30:48.080
here's the thing

30:48.080 --> 30:49.760
and this is coming from a place

30:50.160 --> 30:54.640
of absolutely no research or experience or knowledge

30:54.640 --> 30:55.920
perfect perfect

30:55.920 --> 30:58.960
but why are textbooks so dang dang expensive

30:58.960 --> 31:00.320
that's great stuff

31:00.320 --> 31:00.880
you know

31:00.880 --> 31:01.520
fucking get it dude

31:01.520 --> 31:03.920
it's like I could buy a book

31:03.920 --> 31:05.040
I could go

31:05.040 --> 31:05.520
go on

31:05.520 --> 31:07.360
I can go to Barnes & Noble

31:07.360 --> 31:07.840
right

31:07.840 --> 31:08.160
there you go

31:08.160 --> 31:09.600
and get a reference book

31:09.600 --> 31:11.120
how much does it cost to get a trap

31:11.680 --> 31:13.520
here's all the bugs

31:13.520 --> 31:14.560
right here's a book

31:14.560 --> 31:15.600
clear the aisle folks

31:15.600 --> 31:17.200
it's a book about bugs

31:17.200 --> 31:19.520
about bugs and what 30 bucks

31:19.520 --> 31:21.040
trap 40 bucks

31:21.040 --> 31:22.400
he's about to go off

31:22.400 --> 31:23.200
he's about to nut

31:23.200 --> 31:26.720
but then I go to the university bookstore

31:26.720 --> 31:28.400
to get a book about bugs

31:28.400 --> 31:31.680
and it's a hundred and eighty six dollars

31:31.680 --> 31:33.760
and forty two cents

31:33.760 --> 31:34.320
please hammer don't hurt him

31:34.320 --> 31:36.800
are you telling me there's more bugs

31:36.800 --> 31:38.720
in that university book

31:38.720 --> 31:40.880
than in the book at Barnes & Noble

31:40.880 --> 31:42.320
I don't think so

31:44.640 --> 31:46.640
Justin that sound sucks shit

31:46.640 --> 31:48.000
no that was the wrong one let me try again

31:49.120 --> 31:50.240
thank you

31:50.240 --> 31:51.040
that's not much

31:51.040 --> 31:52.960
this is Seinfeld for bugs

31:52.960 --> 31:55.600
can I go ahead and send Justin his award

31:55.600 --> 32:00.000
for having the most low quality Seinfeld stinger

32:00.000 --> 32:02.800
my man's working with some fucking like

32:02.800 --> 32:03.920
one kilobyte

32:05.120 --> 32:07.840
it sounds like you just opened a birthday card

32:07.840 --> 32:09.280
about Seinfeld

32:09.280 --> 32:11.280
and that's what played when you opened it

32:11.280 --> 32:15.360
it is a fully lost audio codec file

32:15.360 --> 32:17.600
it is so fucked up that file

32:17.600 --> 32:20.160
that's the Seinfeld theme that aliens hear

32:20.160 --> 32:22.240
when that finally reaches them

32:22.240 --> 32:24.160
across the expansive space

32:25.360 --> 32:26.560
yeah I got you guys

32:26.560 --> 32:27.360
it's bad

32:27.360 --> 32:30.240
you don't need this book though

32:30.240 --> 32:31.200
what if it's a test

32:32.160 --> 32:34.320
it's not gonna be a test though

32:34.320 --> 32:36.080
hey have you guys ever thought about

32:36.080 --> 32:37.040
dead post society

32:37.040 --> 32:39.120
when they tear those pages out of that books

32:39.120 --> 32:40.640
those kids are gotta be thinking like

32:40.640 --> 32:42.800
I spent a hundred and fifty dollars on this book

32:42.800 --> 32:44.320
it's fucking called privilege man

32:44.320 --> 32:46.400
oh dang got it

32:46.960 --> 32:47.760
um I

32:49.280 --> 32:50.960
it's everything's online

32:51.760 --> 32:53.520
the whole thing's on the internet

32:53.520 --> 32:55.040
the whole thing is

32:55.040 --> 32:56.560
if I google what are the bugs

32:57.200 --> 32:59.040
it's just gonna it's gonna pop up

32:59.040 --> 33:00.880
you don't need this optional book

33:00.880 --> 33:01.680
it's optional

33:02.720 --> 33:04.400
I once in college

33:04.400 --> 33:06.480
it was like one of those government classes

33:06.480 --> 33:08.320
you know poly psych class everyone has to take

33:08.960 --> 33:11.840
and there was like probably 200 people in the class

33:11.840 --> 33:13.040
and the professor got up

33:13.040 --> 33:15.120
and started asking questions about the reading

33:15.120 --> 33:17.120
and like the first five people he pointed to

33:17.760 --> 33:19.840
like didn't do the reading

33:19.840 --> 33:21.920
and he said did anybody do the reading

33:21.920 --> 33:23.760
raise your hands if you did the reading

33:23.760 --> 33:25.200
and nobody raised their hands

33:25.200 --> 33:27.200
including myself if I'm being honest

33:27.200 --> 33:29.200
and he just went fuck

33:29.200 --> 33:30.720
and walked out of the room

33:30.720 --> 33:32.480
at which point the TA then said

33:32.480 --> 33:34.400
uh I guess classes cancelled

33:34.400 --> 33:36.320
please do the reading before next class

33:37.200 --> 33:39.520
and it was never mentioned again by the professor

33:39.520 --> 33:40.800
didn't come up anymore

33:40.800 --> 33:43.120
never asked any more questions about the reading

33:43.120 --> 33:46.000
so did everybody in class simultaneously

33:46.000 --> 33:47.280
pull out their skateboards

33:47.280 --> 33:48.400
and grind out of the room

33:49.920 --> 33:51.760
was this the next time he came and sat down

33:51.760 --> 33:53.440
there were 30 whoopee cushions

33:53.440 --> 33:54.960
he couldn't even get into the chair

33:55.520 --> 33:57.280
maybe you shouldn't have accepted tenure

33:57.280 --> 33:58.400
at cool university

34:00.000 --> 34:01.600
that's the sound of grinding

34:01.600 --> 34:02.960
well I think it was more just like

34:02.960 --> 34:04.480
all the students were like

34:04.480 --> 34:06.480
well you haven't ever asked questions

34:06.480 --> 34:08.240
about the reading before

34:08.240 --> 34:09.120
and let's be honest

34:09.120 --> 34:10.960
we're like 19 yeah

34:10.960 --> 34:12.640
and it's could

34:12.640 --> 34:14.960
now here Travis McElroy 36

34:14.960 --> 34:16.000
he's like god damn it

34:16.000 --> 34:17.760
I wish I understood how you know

34:17.760 --> 34:19.120
the government worked better

34:19.120 --> 34:20.560
but when I was 19

34:21.200 --> 34:23.680
I was too busy partying

34:23.680 --> 34:25.280
sure how about a yahoo

34:25.920 --> 34:26.560
yeah I love that

34:26.560 --> 34:27.920
you know what I changed my mind

34:27.920 --> 34:29.200
Alexis buy the book

34:29.200 --> 34:30.400
don't read it now

34:30.400 --> 34:33.680
but hold on to it for the next 17 years

34:33.680 --> 34:34.720
then read it

34:34.720 --> 34:36.800
because that's when you'll appreciate it

34:36.800 --> 34:38.960
yes and but they will have discovered

34:38.960 --> 34:40.080
so many new bugs

34:40.080 --> 34:41.920
and also a lot of them bugs

34:41.920 --> 34:43.200
ain't gonna be around anymore

34:44.000 --> 34:45.280
just because of the planet

34:45.280 --> 34:47.040
and also Timon and Pumba

34:48.800 --> 34:51.040
this yahoo is sent in by Brian Donahue

34:51.040 --> 34:51.760
thank you Brian

34:51.760 --> 34:53.360
it's a yahoo answers user

34:53.360 --> 34:54.800
Brandon who asks

34:55.680 --> 34:57.680
what is the best way to smell good

34:57.680 --> 34:58.800
after eating lunch

35:00.480 --> 35:02.080
I smell pretty fresh

35:02.080 --> 35:03.040
until I eat lunch

35:03.760 --> 35:05.440
every time after I eat lunch in school

35:05.440 --> 35:07.600
I think I smell like food

35:07.600 --> 35:08.480
and I hate it

35:08.480 --> 35:09.600
how can I solve this

35:09.600 --> 35:11.200
also I'd like I also

35:12.160 --> 35:13.680
I'd like some tips on how to stay fresh

35:13.680 --> 35:14.800
the whole entire day

35:14.800 --> 35:16.160
thank you for all of your answers

35:16.160 --> 35:19.840
also I have these two adidas colognes

35:19.840 --> 35:21.200
pulse and force

35:22.240 --> 35:23.840
if any of you know about these colognes

35:23.840 --> 35:24.720
I would like your opinion

35:24.720 --> 35:25.920
on which one smells better

35:25.920 --> 35:26.320
thanks

35:26.320 --> 35:27.920
so Brandon's kind of looking for

35:28.480 --> 35:32.800
an all-day sort of general scent strategy

35:33.360 --> 35:35.440
mean with the the anchor being

35:36.080 --> 35:38.160
he gets that lunch stink

35:38.160 --> 35:40.240
that we all know and hate so much

35:40.240 --> 35:42.800
yeah I mean first step

35:43.680 --> 35:45.360
you're going to need some kind of like

35:46.240 --> 35:48.560
let's say maybe vinyl suit

35:49.280 --> 35:50.560
okay gloves

35:51.600 --> 35:53.520
go just like full dexter on it

35:53.520 --> 35:55.440
maybe even lay out some plastic sheeting

35:56.480 --> 35:57.520
okay eat your lunch

35:57.520 --> 36:00.240
because clearly however you're eating it

36:00.240 --> 36:02.800
you're doing a very bad job

36:02.800 --> 36:03.360
here's the problem

36:03.360 --> 36:05.520
you can get a breaking bad hazmat suit

36:05.520 --> 36:07.280
and wear that while you're eating lunch

36:07.280 --> 36:09.440
but where that's more topical than dexter

36:09.440 --> 36:10.080
yes thank you

36:10.640 --> 36:14.320
how does the food get through

36:14.320 --> 36:16.240
the decontamination layer

36:16.240 --> 36:16.800
tubes

36:19.360 --> 36:22.160
but your your osmosis is the problem

36:22.160 --> 36:23.760
is your osmosis in the garlic

36:23.760 --> 36:26.400
like once it's internal that's the day

36:26.400 --> 36:28.800
well you could do a lot of uh you know

36:28.800 --> 36:29.760
a lot of simp

36:29.760 --> 36:32.080
like a lot of uh neutral foods

36:32.640 --> 36:34.240
oh like what like what

36:34.240 --> 36:35.360
Trav what's a neutral food

36:35.360 --> 36:38.880
plain wheat thins

36:38.880 --> 36:40.880
uh okay but think about this

36:41.520 --> 36:42.880
if you only eat that

36:42.880 --> 36:43.280
yeah

36:43.280 --> 36:45.200
think of a food where someone said

36:45.200 --> 36:46.320
oh that guy

36:46.320 --> 36:47.840
oh he smells like wheat thins

36:47.840 --> 36:49.680
like it's maybe worse

36:49.680 --> 36:51.680
it's worse it's bad that's bad

36:51.680 --> 36:53.040
somebody's gonna be like

36:53.040 --> 36:55.360
somebody smells like a spicy puttanesca

36:55.360 --> 36:56.960
and it's a strange human smell

36:56.960 --> 36:57.920
but i don't hate it

36:57.920 --> 36:59.680
if that's like that's tony

36:59.680 --> 37:01.200
that's wheat thins tony

37:02.480 --> 37:04.480
okay what is a neutral food

37:04.480 --> 37:06.640
my man smells like a pantry over there

37:06.640 --> 37:07.440
it's wild

37:07.440 --> 37:09.680
plain uncooked pasta

37:10.640 --> 37:12.880
oh just have a little crunchy diversion

37:12.880 --> 37:13.440
yeah

37:13.440 --> 37:15.600
some of us have become accustomed to that

37:16.160 --> 37:17.600
well the question asker didn't

37:17.600 --> 37:19.360
isn't worried about the visuals right

37:19.360 --> 37:20.080
or the sound

37:20.640 --> 37:22.400
only the scent

37:22.400 --> 37:23.440
right the smell

37:23.440 --> 37:24.960
it's not it's no it's no good

37:24.960 --> 37:26.960
and also clearly pulse is better

37:27.840 --> 37:29.360
pulse is better than force

37:30.080 --> 37:30.640
yes

37:30.640 --> 37:32.320
in any scenario

37:32.320 --> 37:34.560
also adidas why are you naming your colognes

37:34.560 --> 37:36.400
after like x-men powers

37:36.400 --> 37:36.640
yeah

37:37.920 --> 37:39.520
another good question for adidas

37:39.520 --> 37:41.520
because neither pulse nor force

37:42.240 --> 37:42.960
added to the list

37:42.960 --> 37:47.040
neither pulse nor force conjure any kind of olfactory meaning to me

37:47.840 --> 37:48.080
like

37:48.080 --> 37:49.200
pulse pulse does for

37:49.200 --> 37:50.240
pulse is like

37:50.240 --> 37:52.960
i'm excrete i'm excreting something

37:52.960 --> 37:55.120
in a steady rhythmic manner

37:55.120 --> 37:56.720
oh okay i guess

37:56.720 --> 38:00.000
which is how we all want to exude smell

38:00.000 --> 38:01.920
it's pulsating sniff it

38:01.920 --> 38:03.440
yeah that's where they're

38:03.440 --> 38:05.440
you don't want a big spike of smell

38:05.440 --> 38:08.240
you want a slow pulse of smell all day

38:08.240 --> 38:10.800
which i think is what the question asker is looking for

38:11.760 --> 38:12.480
i think

38:13.440 --> 38:13.760
that

38:14.400 --> 38:15.120
the school

38:16.080 --> 38:16.560
shower

38:17.120 --> 38:18.400
as a concept

38:19.120 --> 38:22.400
is so it was antiquated when i was in school

38:22.400 --> 38:22.880
yes

38:22.880 --> 38:25.200
the fact that they were like go play baseball

38:25.200 --> 38:27.360
and i was like i don't want to play baseball

38:27.360 --> 38:30.080
but i'll do it for a for a good grade

38:30.080 --> 38:31.440
for a Klondike bar

38:31.440 --> 38:32.400
those are important to me

38:32.400 --> 38:35.120
good grades and Klondike bars are both important to me

38:35.120 --> 38:36.880
get nude and wet

38:36.880 --> 38:39.040
no that one i'm not gonna do

38:39.040 --> 38:40.800
i'm just gonna go be

38:40.800 --> 38:43.360
i'm not going to effort very much at baseball

38:43.360 --> 38:44.880
i'll split the difference

38:44.880 --> 38:46.960
that's why i took individual dual sports

38:46.960 --> 38:49.840
which included such sports as golf archery

38:49.840 --> 38:51.760
i was a big ping pong fan

38:51.760 --> 38:53.040
now let me say this

38:54.000 --> 38:56.320
if they had just had the showers

38:57.200 --> 38:58.560
available at school

38:58.560 --> 39:02.320
at school anytime you needed to freshen up

39:03.600 --> 39:05.280
i wouldn't have used them still back then

39:05.280 --> 39:08.000
but nowadays like that idea resonates with me

39:08.000 --> 39:10.160
these days i don't want to always shower

39:10.160 --> 39:12.160
right when i wake up first thing in the morning

39:12.160 --> 39:14.320
because i don't know what kind of stinky business

39:14.320 --> 39:16.160
i'm going to get into that day

39:16.160 --> 39:16.720
right

39:16.720 --> 39:20.720
yeah now let me eat my let me eat my stinky fucking lunch

39:20.720 --> 39:22.240
and then i'll go have a spritz

39:22.240 --> 39:23.440
and then i'll go rinse off

39:23.440 --> 39:25.280
it's also 20 funny

39:25.280 --> 39:26.240
are you telling me

39:26.240 --> 39:32.000
me that we don't have the technology to build a like a like a human washing machine

39:32.000 --> 39:33.760
like a car wash for humans

39:33.760 --> 39:35.760
that i don't need to get nude in

39:35.760 --> 39:38.480
a coffin that should blast me

39:38.480 --> 39:42.240
i'm just saying i should be able to fully clothed step into it

39:42.240 --> 39:42.480
wait

39:42.480 --> 39:45.040
soaks me then powerful dryers

39:45.040 --> 39:45.520
okay

39:45.520 --> 39:47.440
and i step out and i'm totally clean

39:47.440 --> 39:48.160
including my clothes

39:48.160 --> 39:49.440
because here's the thing Griffin

39:49.440 --> 39:51.920
you eat a powerful stanky lunch right

39:51.920 --> 39:52.800
you get clean

39:52.800 --> 39:55.360
your clothes still smell like the food

39:55.360 --> 39:57.280
that's possible that's possible

39:57.280 --> 40:02.080
i do think that there is going to be a funny a 20 funny scenario

40:02.080 --> 40:04.160
where like i go in there with a wool sweater

40:04.160 --> 40:04.560
uh-huh

40:04.560 --> 40:05.360
and then it blasts me

40:05.360 --> 40:07.360
and then when i come out the sweater is all shrunk down

40:07.360 --> 40:08.800
everybody sees my abs

40:08.800 --> 40:09.280
yes

40:09.280 --> 40:11.440
and that could be funny though

40:11.440 --> 40:12.800
like it's not necessarily a bad thing

40:12.800 --> 40:14.720
i think you know the risks when you go in there

40:14.720 --> 40:15.920
and all your clothes get small

40:15.920 --> 40:17.920
and you can step out and be like oh no i have tract disease

40:17.920 --> 40:19.520
or something like funny punchline

40:19.520 --> 40:22.240
something oh i got big you know

40:22.240 --> 40:23.760
mint mint

40:23.760 --> 40:29.040
mint like for your whole like for your whole body

40:29.600 --> 40:30.480
just like a mint

40:30.480 --> 40:32.720
well that's good for the mouth Justin

40:32.720 --> 40:35.520
what about your face where the food rubbed on your hands

40:35.520 --> 40:38.000
what about my arms and legs where the food rubbed on

40:38.000 --> 40:39.040
because i did drop them

40:39.600 --> 40:40.160
rub the mint

40:40.800 --> 40:42.160
rub the mint all over the mint

40:42.960 --> 40:43.360
yeah

40:43.360 --> 40:46.320
all over you and is it too late for 20 rub the minty

40:46.960 --> 40:47.680
that's good

40:47.680 --> 40:50.640
yeah let me rub let me rub the mint all over my lap

40:50.640 --> 40:56.480
so i get a good burn going on down there Justin

40:56.480 --> 40:56.720
what

40:56.720 --> 40:58.800
this is my this i'm using it now to bail out

41:01.440 --> 41:02.560
not to freshen up the show

41:02.560 --> 41:03.520
but to save myself

41:06.960 --> 41:07.920
i want a munch

41:07.920 --> 41:08.480
squad

41:10.880 --> 41:12.720
i want to munch

41:12.720 --> 41:13.280
squad

41:16.080 --> 41:18.000
welcome to munch squad's podcast on the podcast

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
but the latest and greatest in brand eating

41:20.000 --> 41:23.920
i want to thank Kendra for sending this one my way

41:25.200 --> 41:27.520
my my my munch squad rangers

41:28.160 --> 41:29.200
my munch squadron

41:29.200 --> 41:31.600
what did what did their elf what did their elf i see

41:33.040 --> 41:33.840
they're out there

41:34.800 --> 41:36.560
they're getting a little bit local

41:37.200 --> 41:38.160
shade grown

41:38.880 --> 41:40.640
farm to podcast

41:40.640 --> 41:41.440
munch squads

41:42.400 --> 41:44.240
this is from a restaurant called

41:45.120 --> 41:46.000
spangles

41:46.000 --> 41:46.320
oh

41:46.320 --> 41:48.960
oh spangles

41:48.960 --> 41:50.400
and i think it's in Kansas

41:50.400 --> 41:53.440
because this is from the the Wichita Eagle

41:53.440 --> 41:54.240
this story

41:55.840 --> 41:57.200
about spangles

41:58.240 --> 42:00.560
it long ago past its 21st birthday

42:00.560 --> 42:02.560
it turns 42 in January

42:02.560 --> 42:03.760
but as of this week

42:03.760 --> 42:04.960
it's now legal to drink

42:05.760 --> 42:06.800
the chain is adding

42:07.520 --> 42:08.080
99

42:08.080 --> 42:08.240
i

42:09.680 --> 42:11.760
this is such a fucking disaster

42:12.640 --> 42:13.280
so okay

42:13.280 --> 42:14.080
a little background

42:14.080 --> 42:17.680
spangles looks like a sort of a burger

42:17.680 --> 42:19.120
and chicken sandwich

42:19.120 --> 42:21.360
kind of like a almost looks like a

42:23.360 --> 42:24.160
checkers

42:24.160 --> 42:24.880
or like a

42:26.080 --> 42:27.360
carl's juniors

42:27.360 --> 42:28.960
you know in that neck of the woods

42:28.960 --> 42:30.240
you know maybe like a rallies

42:30.240 --> 42:30.960
that kind of vibe right

42:30.960 --> 42:31.680
that is checkers

42:31.680 --> 42:32.720
you can't say it twice

42:32.720 --> 42:32.960
okay

42:34.880 --> 42:35.200
thank you

42:36.000 --> 42:39.600
so the chain is adding 99 cent margaritas

42:39.600 --> 42:41.200
and screwdrivers

42:41.200 --> 42:42.800
to its menu on Friday

42:42.800 --> 42:45.440
at a rest at its restaurant near 21st and Woodlawn

42:46.080 --> 42:47.520
here's a quote from Dale Steven

42:48.080 --> 42:50.560
who co-owns Spangle with his brother Craig

42:51.280 --> 42:52.240
sound like fun guys

42:52.880 --> 42:53.840
we're just gonna do

42:54.480 --> 42:57.360
one store to work out the little training and kinks

42:57.920 --> 43:00.720
after that we will implement it in all the stores

43:02.000 --> 43:06.160
the impetus for drinks comes from increasing fast casual competitors that serve alcohol

43:06.720 --> 43:08.640
this is another quote from Dale Steven

43:08.640 --> 43:11.520
you can't go anywhere with your family that doesn't have alcohol

43:11.520 --> 43:15.600
the steven's remedy to that is not to try to make a

43:17.120 --> 43:18.400
he doesn't try to make a

43:19.040 --> 43:20.400
a refuge

43:20.400 --> 43:22.320
he's taken out if you can't beat him

43:22.320 --> 43:23.840
join him kind of a brunch with this

43:23.840 --> 43:24.880
more than that

43:24.880 --> 43:26.000
if you can't beat them

43:26.960 --> 43:28.480
vastly under sell them

43:28.480 --> 43:31.040
and get them so fucking faded

43:31.040 --> 43:32.800
that they don't know which way is up

43:32.800 --> 43:35.040
and they eat three too many burgers

43:35.040 --> 43:36.320
oh see that felt

43:36.320 --> 43:37.920
oh see i was going to say

43:37.920 --> 43:38.960
it felt a little more like

43:38.960 --> 43:39.920
Dale was saying like

43:39.920 --> 43:44.560
everyone i go i don't go anywhere with my family that doesn't have alcohol

43:44.560 --> 43:46.640
yeah i couldn't go to my own restaurant

43:46.640 --> 43:47.680
and it was shameful

43:47.680 --> 43:49.120
but now i can

43:49.120 --> 43:52.160
because you couldn't get a alcohol at fast food restaurants

43:52.160 --> 43:53.680
except now you can

43:53.680 --> 43:54.720
for 99

43:55.840 --> 43:58.000
we're always trying to be unique

43:58.000 --> 43:59.040
Steven says

43:59.040 --> 44:02.560
there's just a whole list of things that we always try to be the first at

44:02.560 --> 44:07.440
apparently this this checks off uh getting people fucking plowed

44:07.440 --> 44:10.320
for no money

44:10.320 --> 44:10.820
now

44:12.240 --> 44:14.560
Spangles has done drive-thru business in the evenings

44:14.560 --> 44:16.000
but not much dine-in business

44:16.640 --> 44:19.760
quote it kind of leaves a lobby that could use some excitement

44:20.400 --> 44:22.800
in the evenings all fast foods are relatively so

44:22.800 --> 44:25.600
oh Steven i think things are about to get mighty exciting

44:27.040 --> 44:29.760
dude get your ass to Spangles

44:29.760 --> 44:31.440
we are getting fucked up tonight

44:31.440 --> 44:34.480
yeah we're going to Spangles for Doug's bachelor party

44:34.480 --> 44:37.600
holy shit Doug's gonna die

44:37.600 --> 44:39.680
he thinks drinks could be a draw

44:39.680 --> 44:41.840
quote it's a dine-in only product

44:41.840 --> 44:43.680
no fucking shit Dale

44:43.680 --> 44:48.240
Dale are you telling me you don't have the world's first drive-thru margarita window

44:49.360 --> 44:51.840
that seems like a choice a choice idea

44:51.840 --> 44:54.720
just cruise on through and get marked from the road

44:54.720 --> 44:58.320
if it's the morning times treat yourself to a screwdriver

44:58.320 --> 45:00.800
dig into your between the car seats

45:00.800 --> 45:03.520
pull out enough money to buy three screwdrivers

45:03.520 --> 45:04.400
it's party time

45:05.280 --> 45:09.280
um this okay i i'm actually this is like different for us

45:09.280 --> 45:14.960
but um um the quotes in this story get so wet and wild

45:15.520 --> 45:16.960
i'm gonna share this

45:17.520 --> 45:21.200
Griffin i'm gonna shoot this to your slack if you can

45:21.760 --> 45:25.520
and will you just read the quotes and i'll read the story parts okay

45:25.520 --> 45:26.960
this is how it's written down in the story

45:26.960 --> 45:29.520
so like a call and response like we're in church

45:29.520 --> 45:31.520
but this is how it's written in the story

45:31.520 --> 45:34.400
okay he says

45:34.400 --> 45:38.480
Spangles is known for its orange juice slush so screwdriver slush made sense

45:38.480 --> 45:42.880
screwdrivers and margaritas including lime and strawberry ones with salt or sugar rims

45:42.880 --> 45:45.280
are inexpensive and quick to make Stephen said

45:45.280 --> 45:46.480
we have to be fast

45:47.200 --> 45:49.120
there won't be beer or wine at this point

45:49.120 --> 45:50.240
it's down the road

45:51.040 --> 45:54.560
the margaritas will each be made with one and a half ounces of tequila

45:54.560 --> 45:56.560
and the screwdrivers will have an ounce of vodka

45:56.560 --> 45:59.680
it's delicious and it's got plenty of alcohol

45:59.680 --> 46:03.440
he says that it's clear there's enough alcohol

46:03.440 --> 46:05.280
the second you sip it

46:06.240 --> 46:08.160
Stephen said the drinks will be served in

46:08.160 --> 46:10.240
a heavy duty glass mug

46:11.040 --> 46:13.360
it's going to be done right

46:14.720 --> 46:16.240
that's the end of the story

46:18.000 --> 46:22.320
Dale Stephen you're about to fucking bump off in that place

46:22.320 --> 46:24.800
holy shit does this have alcohol in it

46:25.360 --> 46:25.920
sip it

46:25.920 --> 46:29.680
Hey guys, Spanglers is broken bad

46:29.680 --> 46:33.040
sip it and you shall know the truth

46:33.920 --> 46:35.920
please if you're near this area

46:35.920 --> 46:37.120
please hit a wrist Spangles

46:37.120 --> 46:39.600
and send us a picture of the smoking wreckage

46:40.960 --> 46:44.800
when they start getting people plowed on 99 cent margaritas

46:44.800 --> 46:45.520
god bless

46:46.240 --> 46:47.760
it's delicious though

46:47.760 --> 46:50.000
and it does got plenty of alcohol

46:50.000 --> 46:52.480
approximately one and one half ounces

46:52.480 --> 46:54.320
enough to sip it and know

46:54.320 --> 46:56.240
at least the mugs are heavy duty

46:56.240 --> 46:58.400
so that when they are thrown frequently

46:58.400 --> 47:01.520
they will do tremendous ballistic damage

47:02.560 --> 47:04.160
when they're tossed at your server

47:04.160 --> 47:06.640
for not bringing the mustard fast enough

47:06.640 --> 47:08.400
because you're fucking drunk

47:09.440 --> 47:10.160
oh boy

47:10.160 --> 47:13.840
and demanding mustard for a mustard magic trick

47:13.840 --> 47:16.640
your buddy says he knows how to do

47:16.640 --> 47:20.160
if only that fucking waitress would bring the fucking mustard already

47:20.160 --> 47:22.720
this mustard trick is going to really quote

47:22.720 --> 47:24.400
blow your ass apart

47:24.400 --> 47:24.720
wow

47:27.920 --> 47:28.400
oh boy

47:29.360 --> 47:30.400
we want to be the first

47:31.280 --> 47:32.320
first with margaritas

47:32.320 --> 47:32.960
well

47:32.960 --> 47:34.720
first to have an on-site murder

47:34.720 --> 47:36.160
first Spangles location

47:37.280 --> 47:39.920
that's also that's the kinks they're gonna work out

47:39.920 --> 47:42.240
like hey so uh we're just gonna do it

47:42.240 --> 47:45.040
in what we're calling our most expendable store

47:49.840 --> 47:52.000
I feel bad for those people who are on the

47:52.000 --> 47:54.400
the uh the the slab there

47:54.400 --> 47:55.920
for the first time

47:55.920 --> 47:56.880

47:57.120 --> 47:58.480
we just got the menus printed

47:58.480 --> 48:00.320
it says 99 cents

48:00.320 --> 48:01.600
that can't be it right

48:01.600 --> 48:02.720
this can't be right

48:02.720 --> 48:03.600
hey boss

48:03.600 --> 48:05.760
it's our first night of this promotion

48:05.760 --> 48:06.800
I did want to ask

48:06.800 --> 48:08.720
how many windows do you have

48:09.440 --> 48:11.200
at your house kind of saved

48:11.200 --> 48:12.800
to replace the windows here

48:12.800 --> 48:14.480
because we're on our third window already

48:14.480 --> 48:15.280
we just want to just

48:15.280 --> 48:18.640
can we get some chicken wire up in front of the registers

48:18.640 --> 48:21.040
can you just fucking like roadhouse

48:21.040 --> 48:22.800
this entire establishment

48:22.800 --> 48:23.680
that would be great

48:23.680 --> 48:25.120
could you get us a chiller fleet

48:25.120 --> 48:26.400
no not a refrigerator

48:26.400 --> 48:29.440
somebody to cool out kind of when the fights happen

48:30.000 --> 48:32.560
thanks y'all for for hanging out with us

48:32.560 --> 48:34.320
uh welcome to 20 funny

48:34.880 --> 48:37.440
uh we are so happy to

48:37.440 --> 48:39.040
that you've stayed with us for

48:40.240 --> 48:43.840
uh it'll be a decade this year

48:43.840 --> 48:46.080
it'll be uh this April

48:46.080 --> 48:48.880
will mark the 10th anniversary of my brother my brother me

48:48.880 --> 48:49.600
as improbable

48:49.600 --> 48:50.560
so wild

48:50.560 --> 48:51.440
as that may be

48:51.440 --> 48:54.400
so thank you for for your continued indulgence

48:54.400 --> 48:55.760
uh I I also want to say

48:55.760 --> 49:00.480
so as of recording this uh we have not had a baby yet

49:00.480 --> 49:01.280
my wife and I

49:01.280 --> 49:02.400
we bought a baby

49:02.400 --> 49:03.440
it's a boy

49:03.440 --> 49:07.200
by any day now that baby is going to be born

49:07.200 --> 49:10.800
and that's probably going to chunk up the release schedule a little bit

49:10.800 --> 49:12.080
and kind of I don't know

49:12.080 --> 49:13.760
we might put up some live shows

49:13.760 --> 49:15.920
or maybe a couple like best of

49:15.920 --> 49:17.920
and I appreciate your understanding

49:17.920 --> 49:22.400

49:23.120 --> 49:24.400

Hi I'm Allie Gertz

52:05.840 --> 52:07.040
And I'm Julia Prescott

52:07.040 --> 52:09.280
And we host Round Springfield

52:09.280 --> 52:14.160
Round Springfield is a new Simpsons podcast that is Simpsons adjacent

52:14.960 --> 52:18.480
in its topic we talk to Simpsons writers directors

52:18.480 --> 52:20.480
voiceover actors you name it

52:20.480 --> 52:22.960
about non-Simpsons things that they've done

52:22.960 --> 52:26.640
because surprise they're all extremely talented

52:26.640 --> 52:29.760
absolutely for example David X Cohen worked on the Simpsons

52:29.760 --> 52:32.400
but then created a little show called Futurama

52:32.400 --> 52:34.000
that's our very first episode

52:34.000 --> 52:37.680
so tune in for stuff like that with Yardley Smith with Tim Long with different writers

52:37.680 --> 52:39.440
and voice actors it's gonna be so much fun

52:39.440 --> 52:42.400
and we are every other week on Maximumfun.org

52:42.400 --> 53:04.400
