WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.320
The new recipe crust from Domino's.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.720
My tiger print silk pants.

00:52.720 --> 00:58.800
Um, those pop-tarts that don't have frosting on them.

01:04.080 --> 01:04.960
Asian people.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.400
Old car smell.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.200
Old Asian people smell.

01:17.200 --> 01:27.520
We are thankful for so much here at My Brother, My Brother, and Me. We just wanted to take a moment

01:29.120 --> 01:37.680
to express the things that we are thankful for. Now, was what I just said racist? No. No.

01:37.680 --> 01:43.440
It's a celebration. You love the smell of like Pat Morita and all other old Asian people. He's

01:43.440 --> 01:48.320
dead. He's dead as fuck, isn't he, Pat? Yeah, I would not enjoy that smell, I think.

01:51.520 --> 01:59.040
I don't like it. This is Thanksgiving week at My Brother, My Brother, and Me. Just give a thanks

01:59.040 --> 02:05.680
saying, have you taken a moment to say like, this is what I'm thankful for. I'm thankful for that

02:05.680 --> 02:15.920
guy on my Facebook that only posts pictures that he found like that got forwarded to him by his

02:15.920 --> 02:20.480
grandpa. It's like, look at this girl. Can you believe how chubby she is and she's in a wedding

02:20.480 --> 02:26.160
dress like that guy. I'm thankful for him because he makes me feel pretty good about my whole whole

02:26.160 --> 02:30.880
deal. Yeah, I'm thankful for the people that every time you talk about how much you're looking

02:30.880 --> 02:36.240
forward to Thanksgiving, they remind you about, you know, genocide and stuff. Do you have people

02:36.240 --> 02:46.720
in your life like that? Yes, I do. Well, not anymore. Griffin, what is the Turkey Day procedure

02:46.720 --> 02:53.680
like in Texas? Everything's bigger there. Are there like giant... Do you know how turkeys are

02:53.680 --> 03:00.800
descended from raptors? Yeah. That's basically what we're working with down here is raptors

03:00.800 --> 03:06.560
sized turkeys. You have to... Just turkeys lying on the shelves the size of sumo brand bean bag

03:06.560 --> 03:13.600
chairs. You gotta come at them from the side, these turkeys, because they're so big. They're

03:13.600 --> 03:20.080
goblers. They will just swing their goblers around like flesh maces. They'll take you down.

03:22.320 --> 03:26.320
Is that what those things are called? Gobblers? I think they're called waddles. Waddles? Waddle

03:26.320 --> 03:33.040
gobble. Waddle gobblers. I made an ascot out of a waddle gobbler once. Oh yeah? Yeah, Tim Gunn

03:33.040 --> 03:40.720
panned it. He said no. That guy is so authoritative. He looked at me. He looked at me in the eye and he

03:40.720 --> 03:45.920
was like, make it jerk. And I was like, you're hurting my feelings, but that wasn't like a good

03:45.920 --> 03:50.800
burn. You didn't do it. That's like a good burn. Did not sense Tim. Yeah, Tim. Timothy. Are you drunk,

03:50.800 --> 03:57.920
Tim? I'm super drunk. Justin. Favorite Thanksgiving food? Go. Sweet potato casserole. Me too.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.920
Right there with you, Travis. Hey, everybody. Is it all right if I, I mean. No, give us the

04:03.920 --> 04:11.520
dissenting. We have given the main and concurring opinions. It's pumpkin roll. Oh, pumpkin roll?

04:12.080 --> 04:18.480
Yeah, the dessert. Pumpkin roll. Let me see your pumpkin roll. It's a pumpkin log though, isn't it?

04:18.480 --> 04:24.480
I always, I prefer. That sounds unappetizing. Pumpkin roll. Anything with log in it always

04:24.480 --> 04:30.320
sounds gross. Now this could be, I don't know if this is a, a, a Baptist thing, a Southern thing,

04:31.120 --> 04:41.680
what part of our, our raising this reflects. If you don't eat, uh, your, your, uh, sweet potatoes

04:41.680 --> 04:47.680
with, uh, pecans and brown sugar on top. What are you doing? I, what are you doing?

04:47.680 --> 04:53.920
What if they're allergic to pecans? Yeah, eat it anyway. Suck it up. Suck it up. Have yourself some,

04:53.920 --> 04:59.360
some pumpkin pie and epinephrine. Like just chill out. Yeah, I, it's one day a year. Treat yourself.

04:59.360 --> 05:04.320
If you were putting marshmallows on that, I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get what you're

05:04.320 --> 05:08.960
doing. Aren't you thankful? That, that seems to me like when people tell me that that's like,

05:08.960 --> 05:13.120
it just seems like, and then I put some ice cream cake on top of it and then I covered in chocolate

05:13.120 --> 05:18.800
chip. You're an adult eating with pecans and brown sugar. Yeah. Something sweet, but it highlights

05:18.800 --> 05:23.680
the nutty. This is an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

05:23.680 --> 05:29.520
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin. Hey guys, let's get right into the advice. I'm dating a girl right

05:29.520 --> 05:34.080
now and things aren't going so well. Problem is that she thinks things are going fantastic.

05:35.360 --> 05:39.680
We started, this isn't funny, sorry. When we started dating when we were 16 and now we're 21,

05:39.680 --> 05:45.200
I would love to start seeing other people and doing single guy things. I know breaking up with

05:45.200 --> 05:49.680
her is going to kill her, but at some point I have to put my happiness first, right? How can I let

05:49.680 --> 05:55.280
her down as easily as possible without ruining our lifelong friendship? Oh no, no, no, no,

05:55.280 --> 06:06.720
so many misconceptions. No, this isn't funny. Let's answer the last question first. How can

06:06.720 --> 06:10.480
you let her down as easily as possible without ruining your lifelong, your long friendship?

06:10.480 --> 06:16.560
You can't. You can't. Goodbye, friend. Surprise. Goodbye. You know how people say like,

06:16.560 --> 06:19.600
I didn't want to date him because we were close friends. I didn't want to ruin it. This is what

06:19.600 --> 06:24.640
they mean. They mean this. To be fair, to be fair, they have been together for five years,

06:24.640 --> 06:29.200
so it's not like, well, this didn't work out. They were together for five years. I mean,

06:29.200 --> 06:37.280
five years of good good lovin' is roughly equivalent to one lifelong friendship, I feel like.

06:37.280 --> 06:45.120
I think you are being greedy for wanting more out of this relationship than is natural,

06:45.120 --> 06:49.040
than is reasonable. She ain't gonna wanna have shit to do with you, and honestly, I will tell

06:49.040 --> 06:54.960
you, in all seriousness, we've had some fun here today, but in all seriousness, you are doing her

06:54.960 --> 06:59.680
a disservice by trying to stay in her life, I feel like. If she wants that at some point,

07:01.600 --> 07:07.200
that might be one thing, but you're gonna have to just pull the bandage off and leave. I mean,

07:07.200 --> 07:13.360
just that's the situation. You guys have been together now from your teens, and now you're

07:13.360 --> 07:19.360
entering adulthood, and one of the lessons you learn as an adult is sometimes for the greater

07:19.360 --> 07:25.680
good, you gotta hurt somebody, and there is no way that you can end this and have it end easily

07:25.680 --> 07:31.360
and nicely, and you guys are like, okay, cool. Do you wanna go get some frozen yogurt? You guys

07:31.360 --> 07:36.800
aren't going to be the same kind of friends after this. Just get okay with the fact that,

07:36.800 --> 07:43.520
I'm assuming she's also, yeah, she's 21. Get okay with the fact that she is 21 years old,

07:43.520 --> 07:47.120
and this probably isn't going to be the worst thing that ever happens to her,

07:47.120 --> 07:55.200
even as far as romantic things go. There's a whole lot of other shit coming down the path.

07:55.920 --> 08:00.960
The most important thing is, don't let her listen to this, because there's not a way to do it,

08:01.600 --> 08:08.160
but you just gotta sit her down in person, and it's gonna be, I mean, it's gonna suck,

08:08.160 --> 08:15.760
but you've given each other five years of your life. That hurts. That sucks.

08:15.760 --> 08:23.200
This is almost literally like surgery. No one's really excited to go under the knife and be put

08:23.200 --> 08:29.920
out and everything, but you're cutting this part of your life away. It sucks, but it's necessary.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.040
You have to do it. Yeah, there's no anesthesia. Well, there is.

08:34.240 --> 08:42.480
You're 21 now. You're 21 now. There's adult anesthesia. It's just gonna suck. You're just

08:42.480 --> 08:46.320
gonna have to sit down and say, but be direct about it, be honest about it, and just say that

08:48.480 --> 08:55.760
she's great, and it's just she's not the right person for you. As great as she is, it's not.

08:55.760 --> 09:01.520
I mean, that's gonna suck for her to hear. It sucks to get dumped. It sucks, it sucks, it sucks,

09:01.520 --> 09:05.920
but you're right in that you're not doing anybody a favor by staying in a relationship. You're not

09:05.920 --> 09:11.920
happy yet. That's not good for her. It's not good for you, and she's quickly arcing past

09:11.920 --> 09:17.120
her sexual prime. Oh, you got it. You've got to let her. She has like another six months. She's

09:17.120 --> 09:29.760
got six months tops. Stop. What is the prime? What's the prime? When is it? Well, for girls,

09:29.760 --> 09:34.720
they peak at like 21, and then they're done by 22, and then they have like 20 low years,

09:34.720 --> 09:40.560
and then they come back up 40, and they're cougars. Yeah, they're banging. I think 21.5

09:40.560 --> 09:46.880
is the prime. That's the target. It is a prime number. Jesus. What is it for men?

09:47.920 --> 09:57.600
For men? It's 12. 12 and then 76. 12 to 14, then we're out of it for a few years. 12 to 14 is like

09:57.600 --> 10:02.960
your middle school teachers. Those ladies are like, hey, I see what he's cooking up.

10:02.960 --> 10:13.360
The scrambled up spice channel. Then you drop out from like 14 to, if memory serves, about 25.

10:14.240 --> 10:17.520
You're kind of out of the game, and then once you get out of college,

10:20.240 --> 10:23.120
I hope you've latched on to somebody by then. Yeah, by the time you get out of college,

10:23.120 --> 10:28.960
you have like three days of sexual crime. I have a chart somewhere. I'll show you

10:28.960 --> 10:35.440
sometime, Griffin. It's a sliding scale. Here's the point. We're all past it. Long story short,

10:35.440 --> 10:40.640
we're old. It's basically like the lifespan of a fruit fly. That's how long we have to mate,

10:40.640 --> 10:48.640
really. Darius, no, but here's the thing about this. You should dread it. You are not going to

10:48.640 --> 10:55.520
get out of it easily. You are not going to. You're not going to get out of it without ruining your

10:55.520 --> 11:03.840
friendship. It is what it is, but you have to accept that sooner rather than later so you can

11:03.840 --> 11:09.280
get to the actual doing of it. Because after it's done, you are going to feel a lot better,

11:09.280 --> 11:13.440
and she will be better in the long run, even though she won't feel better for a much longer time.

11:13.440 --> 11:20.160
There's also a good chance the problem of she thinks things are going fantastic is that that is

11:20.160 --> 11:28.160
a defense mechanism because she feels that you are drifting away. So that idea of trying to keep

11:28.160 --> 11:34.720
things going as well as maybe they went in the past. So she probably knows that something is

11:34.720 --> 11:39.600
going wrong. Something's gone awry. Right. Something's gone askew, but you got to do it.

11:39.600 --> 11:46.880
Is there a polite, non-offensive way to ask if someone is gay? I have a friend, and everyone who

11:46.880 --> 11:51.440
hangs out with him thinks he might be gay, but of course no one wants to ask him. It's not that we

11:51.440 --> 11:55.600
care one way or the other what his sexual orientation is. We just want to know, but it

11:55.600 --> 12:02.880
doesn't seem like something you could ask point blank, wondering in Wisconsin. I would argue you

12:02.880 --> 12:11.200
do care one way or the other because you want to know. You understand? Right? I mean, if you didn't,

12:11.200 --> 12:18.400
like, I don't care what the special is at Tudor's Biscuit World tomorrow, and as a result,

12:18.400 --> 12:24.640
I have not endeavored to unearth that information. Here's what you're going to need to do.

12:24.640 --> 12:31.040
It's stewed tomatoes. You're going to need to set up like a kickball game,

12:31.040 --> 12:35.680
and then when you're establishing teams, you say, everyone who's straight is on that team,

12:35.680 --> 12:41.680
and everyone who's gay is on that team. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. I think that's

12:41.680 --> 12:50.800
pretty good. Oh, God. Just a quick straw poll. Anybody here gay? And if he raises his hand,

12:50.800 --> 12:57.920
you know that he is. Yeah, that's a good trick. That is great. What I find funny about this idea

12:57.920 --> 13:03.360
of wanting to ask this, is that when you meet someone that you think is straight,

13:03.360 --> 13:10.320
you don't ask them if they're straight. Hey, what's up? You straight? Huh? Huh? Like,

13:10.320 --> 13:14.960
I don't know. Maybe the reason that he doesn't go around telling people whether he's gay or

13:14.960 --> 13:19.840
straight is he doesn't want to be identified by sexual preference. That could be it. Yeah.

13:19.840 --> 13:26.880
That's what are you even talking about? That is how I define myself, is a straight. Hey,

13:26.880 --> 13:32.720
everybody. I'm straight Travis. Hi, I'm Griffin, and I like ladies. To be fair, that was also the

13:32.720 --> 13:40.640
name of my spoken word album. Straight Travis. Straight Travis, no chaser. That was a really,

13:40.640 --> 13:46.240
I thought you were doing some really bold work there. Thank you so much. The one segment where

13:46.240 --> 13:53.280
you just whistled the theme song to mash for like 15 minutes. I thought it was a really,

13:53.280 --> 13:59.440
really impressive statement. And you know, that was one take. No kidding. Yeah. No chapping.

13:59.440 --> 14:05.200
No, not at all. I had a, an assistant with a spray bottle. Okay. Just keeping it moisturized.

14:05.200 --> 14:11.840
Yeah. That visual image is bad for me. You know, you can't do a hundred percent water blend. You

14:11.840 --> 14:21.280
have to do a 99% water, 1% Vaseline blend to keep it. That's actually what the Occupy Wall Street

14:21.280 --> 14:28.960
protests are about. They're about luby lips? They're about the 99% water, just letting everybody

14:28.960 --> 14:32.640
know. Make sure you have 1% Vaseline. This is the gobbledygook, what you're saying right now.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.400
I'm going to flip it. The gobbler. Don't, do not ask if your friend is gay.

14:39.120 --> 14:44.160
Oh, of course not. No, don't do that. Oh, real quick, just to jump back. Yeah, don't do that.

14:44.160 --> 14:50.720
Either they're not gay and you're going to offend them, or they are gay and maybe they don't want

14:50.720 --> 14:55.200
to tell you that. Just mind your own, you got to mind your own business and you can't have a big

14:55.200 --> 15:03.280
deal out of it. Here's how it goes. It goes one of a few ways. One, no, I'm not gay. Why would you

15:03.280 --> 15:08.480
think that? Whoa. That's a weird conversation you're going to get into. Other option. Yeah,

15:08.480 --> 15:13.760
I am gay. Why did you want to know? Are you gay too? Are we going to be, do you want to go on

15:13.760 --> 15:18.080
like a date or something? Not saying that like that is the immediate conclusion, but that would

15:18.080 --> 15:22.240
be the only reasonable reason. That's the only reasonable reason somebody should be asking.

15:22.240 --> 15:27.920
Even the middle of the road, if he's a gay, why does that matter to you? Because it shouldn't.

15:28.720 --> 15:34.240
Just crack, you know, I'm just, uh, just want to crack, crack the case. I just want to, I just

15:34.240 --> 15:40.560
want to make sure you were different from me is all crack the case. When a, uh, when a gay person

15:40.560 --> 15:46.080
is sired, they, they will actually, uh, ask out the, the, just the very next person that they see.

15:46.080 --> 15:52.000
Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's totally, it's a, it's a totally weird biological imperative. I don't,

15:52.000 --> 15:55.760
I don't understand it, but I like it. That's the only reason, that's the only reason, uh,

15:56.560 --> 16:01.600
Ellen DeGeneres was dating Portia de Rossi. Yeah. Yeah. She's just an expert. She hove it into her

16:01.600 --> 16:07.200
field of vision. She's watching Arrested Development and like a baby chick who hatches.

16:07.200 --> 16:14.800
Ellen was like, whoa, I'm gay at ports. I got it. No, I think that my, well, I think that it's the

16:14.800 --> 16:21.360
opposite of that situation. Oh, okay. Cause that is the only thing that makes sense. Portia de Rossi.

16:21.920 --> 16:29.680
Uh, yeah. You with me now? Can we, hold on. Okay. Now, no, hold on. Ellen DeGeneres is a very

16:29.680 --> 16:34.880
attractive woman. What are you talking about now? She is aging very well. She is, she is well

16:34.880 --> 16:40.960
preserved. You can tell she's got her, uh, her water Vaseline blend down. Oh yeah. Right. I don't

16:40.960 --> 16:45.120
like really, you don't get to be, you don't get to be like a talk show superstar unless you have

16:45.120 --> 16:50.240
your Vaseline water blend down. Look at Dr. Phil. He is half Vaseline. Look at that. Look at him

16:50.240 --> 16:56.800
glisten and you could tell star power coming out his, his well hydrated bottom. I learned that in

16:56.800 --> 17:02.160
the classic biography, Straight Oprah. Yeah. Straight Oprah and her chaser. You know, I love

17:02.160 --> 17:09.280
that 15 minute whistling solo she does in that album. This is a very cyclical episode. I heard

17:09.280 --> 17:14.960
it was all one take. That's true, but she had to have an assistant there with a spray bottle.

17:14.960 --> 17:19.600
Yeah. Do you guys want to Yahoo to stop this please? Desperately. This one was, this one was

17:19.600 --> 17:23.520
sent in by Jacob blocker. Thanks Jacob. It's by Yahoo answers user Edward Alec, who asks,

17:24.800 --> 17:28.480
could I eat an entire bag of pizza rolls without dying?

17:30.560 --> 17:35.040
My friend says I'll die or something. If I eat an entire bag of pizza rolls, 90 count,

17:35.040 --> 17:40.080
but I know that it's complete poppycock. I'm a 15 year old girl. Who's 125 pounds. Will I die?

17:40.080 --> 17:47.600
Doubt it. Get sick. Probably. I have a bigger problem than 15 year old girl using the word

17:47.600 --> 17:54.480
poppycock. Yeah. What are you doing? So let me do a little quick math here. Okay. 90 pizza

17:55.520 --> 18:00.880
roll. It totally matters. If it's Totino's, everyone knows that those roll. Are they,

18:00.880 --> 18:06.000
are they super stuffed? Yeah. Are they straight cheesy? Are they pepperoni? Because I don't know

18:06.000 --> 18:13.280
that your liver will be able to process all of the, the fat, the unsaturated saturated triple

18:13.280 --> 18:19.600
meat. What if it's double meat? Well, triple triple triple would be our triple meat. So if

18:19.600 --> 18:23.520
you're looking at one's more sausage, if you're looking at pepperoni, which I think is the only

18:23.520 --> 18:30.720
sort of, yeah. I mean, that's the only reasonable thing that in a 15 count bag, no nine doing

18:30.720 --> 18:41.040
90. I know. No, I'm doing a little math here. Count bag. You're looking at a 7.5 ounces. Okay.

18:41.600 --> 18:46.560
Well, that's not that many. No, that doesn't seem that bad. Then multiply that by eight,

18:47.680 --> 18:57.200
six, six, seven point five times six times four times six equals 45 ounces. That's the by that

18:57.200 --> 19:03.280
by 16. It's about 12 pounds. We're talking. Okay. Well we're talking about three pounds of pizza

19:03.280 --> 19:11.600
rolls basically. Man, that's going to be a rough night. What kind of day did you have

19:12.640 --> 19:17.520
that you need to drown it in pizza rolls? Pizza in the morning, pizza after school time,

19:17.520 --> 19:24.080
pizza, never a goddamn gin. Cause that one time I ate 90 pizza rolls. What I like is if,

19:24.080 --> 19:29.040
Griffin, could you read me the last sentence again? Uh, will I die? Doubt it. Get sick.

19:29.040 --> 19:35.680
Probably. So she knows that it is a bad idea, but she will at least get sick. Well, if,

19:35.680 --> 19:41.680
if sorry, if you're, if you were asking yourself the question, will this thing kill me? And your

19:41.680 --> 19:46.880
answer is doubt it. That means there's a shadow of a doubt in your mind that yes, in fact,

19:47.440 --> 19:51.680
eating nine pounds of pizza. You know what though, Griffin, I would say that

19:51.680 --> 19:55.520
that man could have safely stayed on the surface of the earth and just stared at the

19:55.520 --> 19:59.360
moon for the rest of his life. But he was willing to risk it. I'm saying that find out what would

19:59.360 --> 20:05.200
happen eating that Travis is saying this because Travis's daily diet is rated by how much the

20:05.200 --> 20:10.640
likelihood that it will kill him. I'm saying bacon and applesauce, maybe Travis using your

20:10.640 --> 20:15.200
space metaphor, eating three pounds of pizza rolls is going to be going to the moon is going to be

20:15.200 --> 20:23.440
the challenger actually is what's going to happen. Oh no. Oh no. Oh golly. Three pounds of pizza

20:23.440 --> 20:28.400
rolls. It's going to be that fucking, it's going to be gluttony from seven. You're going to die

20:28.400 --> 20:35.600
fat on a table and Brad Pitt's going to be like, Oh gross. I'm so thin and he's so fat.

20:37.920 --> 20:43.680
High school. Three pounds of pizza rolls. Imagine when you do have to go to the hospital,

20:43.680 --> 20:47.920
the doctor's like, we have a patient here. She's got an overdose of flavor. She's got flavor. She's

20:47.920 --> 20:53.120
got terminal flavor. She's been flavor blasted. She's got that Italian zest. Oh, I hit her right

20:53.120 --> 20:56.640
in all the right places. I tell you what's definitely going to be, what's definitely

20:56.640 --> 21:00.960
going to happen is your mom is going to get pissed because you ate all the fucking pizza rolls.

21:02.000 --> 21:08.880
We were saving that from pizza roll night. She just got that at Sam's club. She's got to go all

21:08.880 --> 21:13.920
the way back out to the goddamn Sam's. Why the fuck did I even get the Sam's club membership?

21:13.920 --> 21:19.360
I could have just bought you four bags of pizza rolls at the Walmart and all the Vaseline's gone.

21:19.360 --> 21:27.920
Don't you know the blend? All right. Nine to one. Nurse get me the disaster. This woman ate the

21:27.920 --> 21:38.240
Super Bowl. Please. Jesus. What if she accidentally messes up her digestive system so much that she

21:38.240 --> 21:43.920
can no longer be full unless she eats three pounds of food? Like she stretches it out to a point of

21:43.920 --> 21:48.960
no return. Right. Exactly. Just looks like a colostomy bag hanging out of her navel. All I

21:48.960 --> 21:56.800
can picture is that she's just finished the 89th pizza roll and her greasy slimy hands are clutching

21:56.800 --> 22:02.400
the 90th as she's like shaking and sweating. And she's fallen over at this point because she is

22:02.400 --> 22:10.560
as fat as she is tall. And she's rolling around like violet Beauregard and still she finishes

22:10.560 --> 22:18.320
the bag. Wouldn't it be? That was a real great dismount. You know, this sounds like an episode

22:18.320 --> 22:27.520
of my favorite show on TV right now, which is suicide. Watch man versus food. It's like man

22:27.520 --> 22:32.000
versus food, but instead of going to restaurants and trying their food challenges, he just buys

22:32.000 --> 22:38.480
a lot of shitty food and then tries to eat it at home in the dark. All right, today I went around,

22:38.480 --> 22:45.280
took a long time, but I collected every type of Pringles that there are. If the first half was him

22:45.280 --> 22:49.600
buying the food he was going to destroy with and the second half was watching him eat it as sounds

22:49.600 --> 22:55.360
of silence played in the background, I think I would be really into that show. Only if they had

22:55.360 --> 23:00.640
a special sound effect every time an attendant at the grocery store said, can I help you? And

23:00.640 --> 23:07.280
you just look at him and go, yes, please. Somebody, I need someone. Sir, I think you have enough

23:07.280 --> 23:14.640
Pringles. I think over the credits he should be, he should say like, oh well, because I have to

23:14.640 --> 23:20.320
keep on living. And like over the credit should just be him trying to uncancel his dentist's

23:20.320 --> 23:27.920
appointment and the battle of man versus food. Everyone loses. I really want this show to be

23:27.920 --> 23:35.120
made now. I want to see, I want to see a man astride a mountain of hot pockets just yelling

23:35.120 --> 23:39.840
that God is dead. This is what I want from television. Give me that. I just want to see

23:39.840 --> 23:45.520
a man surrounded by an ocean of empty Pringles cans just saying, I thought the fun would never

23:45.520 --> 23:52.800
stop. Yeah, but it did. Once I popped, I couldn't stop until I died, until I died, until I was

23:52.800 --> 23:58.240
finally shuffled off this mortal coil. Take me there Pringles man. Here's the sad thing about

23:58.240 --> 24:04.960
all this. Okay. Now I'm really wanting pizza rolls. I could really go for some pizza rolls

24:04.960 --> 24:09.600
and Pringles for lunch. That'd be great. What's the like five o'clock cocktail rule for pizza rolls?

24:09.600 --> 24:17.120
How early is too early for pizza rolls? There's nothing, it's never too early. If pizza, if Bagel

24:17.120 --> 24:22.320
Bites can rock the like pizza in the morning thing, then I don't see why they have more of

24:22.320 --> 24:26.560
a claim on it than pizza rolls. Do you know the coffee commercial where someone like starts a pot

24:26.560 --> 24:30.800
and it like wakes everyone in the house up? I would like to make that pizza rolls commercial,

24:30.800 --> 24:34.560
but then everyone comes downstairs and they're just like, what the fuck? What the fuck? It's

24:34.560 --> 24:40.960
nine in the morning. What's the matter with you, Tony? Jesus. You know, Congress just declared

24:40.960 --> 24:45.520
pizza a vegetable. So technically it's like, it's like a pizza, it's like a vegetable roll.

24:46.080 --> 24:51.920
You're starting the morning off with your, it's like a V8, a crunchy V8. Are you fucking kidding

24:51.920 --> 24:57.840
me? Is that a goof? That thing you just said? No. Congress declared that pizza is a vegetable

24:58.640 --> 25:05.280
because of food lobby. Red is now a number. What are you doing in Congress, Congress?

25:06.080 --> 25:09.760
Maybe Congress was just rubber stamping a bunch of stuff without really reading it all the way

25:09.760 --> 25:13.360
through. And then like the next day they're like looking in the paper and it's like pizza,

25:13.360 --> 25:18.400
vegetable, and I'm like, damn it. God damn it. We're not going to be able to put the genie back

25:18.400 --> 25:24.720
in the bottle this time guys. Yeah. Pizza's unvegetable. Congress declares, listen, we were

25:24.720 --> 25:33.440
really baked. Yeah. What's the point in, we rolled a big vegetable and smoked it. Can't we just leave

25:33.440 --> 25:41.920
that up to science? Can't we let science declare what is and is not or logic or the church. I think

25:42.480 --> 25:46.800
separation of church and state, you, you let the church decide what's a vegetable or not. Yeah.

25:46.800 --> 25:55.360
Yeah. Oh God. Unclean. Just wash it. It's just DDT. Just wash it off. That's fine. Not a big deal.

25:55.360 --> 26:01.680
Hey, a lot of people say, guys, you, you are famous. Don't you have famous friends that you

26:01.680 --> 26:06.800
can bring on your show? Don't they need advice from time to time? Why are you keeping them out?

26:07.600 --> 26:11.360
Why are you in my room? Why are you in my room? Get out of here. And then we say,

26:11.360 --> 26:17.520
but you have a point before you go. We should admit that you, you do have a point. Uh, so we

26:17.520 --> 26:22.960
asked some of our famous friends how we could help them. This week we have a question from our dear

26:22.960 --> 26:34.080
friend, a video game parodyist, humorist, singer, songwriter, Brentle Floss. Uh, and let's listen to

26:34.080 --> 26:41.280
his query right now. Hey there, three ME bros. So I've worked from home for a little over a year now.

26:41.280 --> 26:45.920
The majority of my weekday time is spent in my room. I've recently started to worry that maybe

26:45.920 --> 26:49.920
the lack of social interaction isn't good for me. And I remember that at least one of you works from

26:49.920 --> 26:55.120
home. So do you have any tips for how I could continue working from home, but still be a healthy,

26:55.120 --> 27:00.640
productive person? Thanks a bunch. Schlappy the wonder taint. Working from home.

27:00.640 --> 27:08.480
It's a, it's a mixed blessing. I think more blessing than, than curse. I've been, uh,

27:08.480 --> 27:16.320
working out of my house, uh, for, for I guess three years now. Um, it is really hard not to

27:16.320 --> 27:24.480
turn into a little bit of a little bit of a hermit. It gets a little hard to deal with the

27:24.480 --> 27:30.080
emotions of people in the real world. Like, cause you're used to kind of controlling everything

27:30.080 --> 27:33.680
like a hermit, you know, you get, you get to, you see the allure of the lifestyle,

27:33.680 --> 27:38.640
the hermit lifestyle, and it's kind of hard to run away from it. You start to watch extreme

27:38.640 --> 27:44.320
coup bonding and go, yeah, I get it. I get it without the, without the aid of emoticons.

27:45.040 --> 27:50.240
I just don't know. I don't know what expressions people are giving me. I don't know. That's

27:50.240 --> 27:55.200
actually Jerry Griffin carries around a book of facial expressions. Uh, just so you can compare

27:55.200 --> 28:00.720
what people are trying to convey. Your eyes look like semicolons. So that must mean you're trying

28:00.720 --> 28:13.120
to fuck. Um, I, I, you do have to make every concession to have human contact when possible.

28:13.120 --> 28:20.080
I used to think that meant when I heard the FedEx truck pull up running outside to maybe just strike

28:20.080 --> 28:26.320
up a combo, but it's gotta be more substantial than that. Hi Deb, if you're listening by the way.

28:27.040 --> 28:30.080
Mine's Marty. Thanks for all the packages. That's crazy. Marty is your dude? Yeah,

28:30.080 --> 28:34.640
he's really great. Um, sometimes it's a new person. I'm like, hey, get out of here.

28:34.640 --> 28:42.400
Where's Marty? Let Deb bring, bring Deb back. You gotta do your laundry. That's important.

28:42.400 --> 28:47.600
You're going to feel the need to not do it because who gives a fuck? You gotta,

28:47.600 --> 28:54.240
you gotta divorce yourself from the ideology of fuck it. You can't, you can't give into fuck it.

28:54.240 --> 28:59.360
Who have I got to impress today? Uh, in computer because then when people come over to visit and

28:59.360 --> 29:05.200
they can't open the door because of the stacks of newspaper. Yeah, exactly. You are at a constant

29:05.200 --> 29:10.880
Griffin. So right. You have to constantly be making the choice to not fuck it. You have to

29:10.880 --> 29:16.160
be making the choice to say, I'm not fucking it today. Today I'm putting it, I can't, this is a

29:16.160 --> 29:21.040
true, true. I joke a lot about, you know, I work it out of my house somewhere and sweat pants all

29:21.040 --> 29:29.040
the time. I can't wear sweat pants or my, I don't have a workday. They're like, they're like kryptonite.

29:29.040 --> 29:35.680
Like I wear them. It's like I lose, lose all my ability to function as an adult. So wear real

29:35.680 --> 29:42.240
pants. That really helps shower, shower by at least 10 o'clock or at the most 10 o'clock. And,

29:42.240 --> 29:48.080
and you got to put on real big boy clothes and you got to pretend that maybe your desk is next

29:48.080 --> 29:52.880
to a super cute girl's desk and you want to try and impress her with your good posture. You know,

29:53.760 --> 29:59.600
let me ask you guys this cause I do not work from home nor have I ever. So let me ask you this. Do

29:59.600 --> 30:06.240
you guys set up like a, a work schedule? Do you know that at a certain time your workday is done

30:06.240 --> 30:13.280
and you can, is it like homeschooling? I kick it, I start kicking it at nine. At one I take a shower

30:13.280 --> 30:18.000
or no, I'm sorry. That's when I lunch it. And then, and then I'm out by five or six,

30:18.000 --> 30:23.120
depending on the workload. Now how much of that time is spent hiding from the boss?

30:24.880 --> 30:30.160
I don't understand. How much, a large amount of my day is spent flirting with Rebecca from

30:30.160 --> 30:34.560
accounting, which is weird. Standing around the water cooler. Standing around the water cooler,

30:34.560 --> 30:39.440
just gossiping. God, it's so sad to see me gossip. You should see it.

30:39.440 --> 30:43.600
I like to, I'd like to talk about the voice with anyone who will listen,

30:43.600 --> 30:49.280
but unfortunately I'm the only person at home. So I usually just wait for Marty to come by.

30:49.280 --> 30:52.880
I say, Hey, thanks for the package. Just check the voice last night.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.240
But he never did. He never watches it. I don't think he has a TV.

30:58.240 --> 31:06.800
Christmas gift this year. It's, you gotta put, I don't understand these people by the way,

31:06.800 --> 31:15.280
who are putting off their showers. Me, I get up. My day does not start until I shower. I can't do

31:15.280 --> 31:22.960
anything until I've gotten the, just washed off the night and the day freshly.

31:22.960 --> 31:32.560
Wash off the sea salt grime from the docks. The crying myself into my pillow to sleep.

31:32.560 --> 31:36.480
After judging through the seedy underbelly of Huntington, West Virginia.

31:36.480 --> 31:42.240
Yeah. After an ecstasy fueled night of raving, you got to get the ecstasy sweat off.

31:42.240 --> 31:47.280
Just wash the glitter off. It won't come off. You wipe off the grease paint.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.600
The glow in the dark. You cry in the mirror.

31:49.600 --> 31:54.640
Glow in the dark highlighter all over your arms. The residue from candy necklaces.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.960
Five different bracelets from five different dive bars.

32:00.720 --> 32:03.920
Seaman. Strange seaman.

32:04.720 --> 32:08.160
Well, okay. You might've taken it a bit too far.

32:08.160 --> 32:14.720
This is a weird seaman. This feels like a 99% 1% bachelor.

32:14.720 --> 32:17.520
Peculiar. What does this seaman look like to you?

32:17.520 --> 32:20.800
Peculiar. It looks to me like the state of Montana.

32:22.240 --> 32:26.880
I want to do anything other than continue this conversation. So let's go.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.160
Let's go to the money zone.

32:28.160 --> 32:44.240
Oh, this is a special one. This is our dear, dear, dear friends,

32:45.280 --> 32:49.040
Lindsey and Devin Pavlis. And I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

32:49.040 --> 32:53.440
Cause they truly are wonderful people. It is a happy one year anniversary,

32:53.440 --> 32:59.760
birthday, and Thanksgiving. It's a triple holiday. And he says, I love you.

33:00.320 --> 33:07.120
Triple holiday wife. This is a great value I think he's gotten here.

33:08.880 --> 33:11.520
Cause he is really covering all his bases right now.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.560
You know, the federal government could really learn something from Devin.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.200
Let's stack a few more on there. We're close enough to Christmas,

33:17.200 --> 33:19.200
I think that we can throw Christmas up in the mix.

33:19.920 --> 33:20.880
Happy Hanukkah.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.360
Happy Hanukkah. Happy Candle Nights.

33:23.360 --> 33:24.640
Happy Candle Nights, everyone.

33:24.640 --> 33:28.160
Happy Candle Nights, everyone. It's coming around the bend so fast.

33:29.520 --> 33:33.040
I'm just, I'm happy that these two people are on the earth.

33:33.920 --> 33:36.880
Me too. They're great people. They make my life a little better.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.840
I'm glad they found each other in this crazy mixed up world.

33:39.840 --> 33:40.560
It's so hard.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.360
So hard to find someone.

33:43.360 --> 33:44.240
Against all odds.

33:44.240 --> 33:50.720
Against all odds. So happy birthday. Happy Thanksgiving.

33:51.280 --> 33:54.640
Happy Candle Nights. Happy anniversary.

33:54.640 --> 33:58.160
And just in case anyone was wondering, I've decided that from henceforth,

33:58.880 --> 34:01.600
the one year anniversary is the podcast anniversary.

34:01.600 --> 34:01.760
Okay.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.840
Does he get him a podcast?

34:05.200 --> 34:07.520
So everybody make your plan ahead now.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.200
Get your requests in early.

34:11.200 --> 34:15.440
I'm Jesse Thorne. Whether it's music, movies, comedy, books, or whatever,

34:15.440 --> 34:19.120
each week I talk to creative people about how they make their thing.

34:19.120 --> 34:22.560
About the moment when their craft went from a hobby to a career.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.520
And about the thing that surprised them most about the process.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.520
It's The Sound of Young America from MaximumFun.org and PRI.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.280
Public Radio International.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.280
Guys, I have a pressing answer that we need to press.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.080
Okay.

34:38.080 --> 34:39.120
Good.

34:39.120 --> 34:42.000
It's by, oh, I did not read this name.

34:42.560 --> 34:44.320
I'm just going to run right at it.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.240
Mike Skolendulis.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.200
Thanks. Thank you, Mike S.

34:51.200 --> 34:54.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Salim, who asks...

34:54.320 --> 34:57.360
Skolendulis sounds like something you chant before a football game.

34:57.360 --> 34:58.400
That's what it's gonna say!

34:58.400 --> 35:00.400
Skol-go-do-do-do-do-do!

35:01.040 --> 35:03.920
It is by Yahoo Answers user, Salim, who asks...

35:05.040 --> 35:08.160
What are the risks of at-home circumcision?

35:08.160 --> 35:12.720
My girlfriend gets freaked out by my aunt, Peter Wiener.

35:12.720 --> 35:15.440
I am going to police her and get a circumcision, but I don't have health insurance.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.680
I will do it tomorrow after school, but I want to know what the risks are.

35:18.640 --> 35:23.360
He says I will be using alcohol and scissors, but that is so dumb that I can't believe it's true.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.560
Did he say it's so dumb, or did you say it's so dumb?

35:28.560 --> 35:30.720
That was my own editorializing, I apologize.

35:30.720 --> 35:31.120
Okay.

35:31.120 --> 35:31.600
Ed note.

35:31.600 --> 35:31.920
Okay.

35:31.920 --> 35:32.560
Ed note.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.880
This guy is fucking out of his mind dumb.

35:34.880 --> 35:38.080
Oh, God, I guess the biggest risk is that he doesn't die from it.

35:38.080 --> 35:38.580
Yeah.

35:38.580 --> 35:39.760
What are the risks?

35:40.400 --> 35:41.200
All of them.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.000
All of the risks.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.440
This is nothing but risks.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.040
Like, the whole thing is a risk.

35:47.040 --> 35:48.480
It's all risk, no reward.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.760
What are you doing?

35:49.760 --> 35:50.560
Don't double down.

35:51.760 --> 35:52.320
It was okay.

35:52.320 --> 35:55.600
I took a huge risk so that I could have a mangled penis.

35:55.600 --> 35:56.100
Yeah.

35:56.960 --> 35:57.840
I mean, unless you did it...

35:57.840 --> 35:58.800
And here you go, sweetie.

35:58.800 --> 35:59.300
I got...

35:59.300 --> 36:00.880
I care about you so much.

36:00.880 --> 36:01.380
I did...

36:01.380 --> 36:04.640
Every night, I was like, I don't want to do it, I don't want to do it, I don't want to do it.

36:04.640 --> 36:08.560
I'm treating you to a poorly crafted turtleneck sweater.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.080
Like, with fraying at the edges.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.600
My poorly sculpted member.

36:14.800 --> 36:20.960
The reward is, if he does it right, you have a clean and healthy penis tip.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.640
No toboggan required.

36:23.680 --> 36:24.180
Yeah.

36:24.880 --> 36:25.040
But...

36:25.040 --> 36:26.000
And that's a great look.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.360
It's a great...

36:27.360 --> 36:28.320
It's totally in this season.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.520
Streamlined.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.960
It's streamlined.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.640
That's really the only thing that's going for it, I guess.

36:35.440 --> 36:35.760
Yeah.

36:35.760 --> 36:36.240
You can just...

36:36.240 --> 36:41.120
It makes the tip of your penis look like Joe Pesci's head in Home Alone.

36:41.120 --> 36:41.440
Yeah.

36:41.440 --> 36:42.240
Which is really nice.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.000
Oh my god.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.680
After he gets his head burned by the...

36:45.680 --> 36:46.560
Oh man.

36:46.560 --> 36:47.120
Yeah, I know.

36:47.120 --> 36:47.920
Fuck, I can think of...

36:47.920 --> 36:50.160
Oh god, I can think of exactly what you're talking about.

36:50.160 --> 36:50.560
Now I can't...

36:50.560 --> 36:52.000
Time for you to meet the wet bandit.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.320
Oh, it's sticky.

36:54.320 --> 36:55.440
Is it sticky bandit?

36:55.440 --> 36:58.800
It's sticky bandit the first time, then they become the wet bandit.

36:58.800 --> 36:59.760
They become the wet bandit.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.560
Well, they find the right mixture of Vaseline and water.

37:02.560 --> 37:03.060
Fuck.

37:05.760 --> 37:06.320
Downtown.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.360
The risks are actually...

37:09.360 --> 37:10.240
This may surprise...

37:10.240 --> 37:10.800
No risk.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.880
Nothing could possibly go wrong.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.000
You have actually...

37:16.000 --> 37:17.360
Yeah, there is actually no...

37:17.360 --> 37:19.840
There are so many risks, you've actually negated the risk.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.720
The risks all cancel each other out.

37:22.720 --> 37:23.920
It's like algebra.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.360
Algebra of dumb.

37:25.360 --> 37:28.640
It's like that scene in the cartoon where somebody goes flying off a ledge and

37:28.640 --> 37:35.120
and bounces past the glass factory and over the tack truck and into the pillow canal.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.960
That's what's gonna happen.

37:36.960 --> 37:40.640
What you've set yourself up with right now is a sleepwalking olive oil situation.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.400
Just baby hearing all the way.

37:44.400 --> 37:44.720
You're fine.

37:44.720 --> 37:45.840
It's like a baby...

37:45.840 --> 37:49.200
Basically, it's a baby's day out of dumb shit to do your penis.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.240
Oh god.

37:50.240 --> 37:52.160
It's a penis day out.

37:52.160 --> 37:52.720
You are gonna need...

37:52.720 --> 37:56.400
Hey, Chris Columbus, you're welcome for all these goddamn residuals that slide in today.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.800
Chris Columbus, you make me so sad.

37:59.760 --> 38:05.200
You are going to need the sharpest scissors and all of that.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.360
And the steeliest will.

38:07.360 --> 38:07.600
Yeah.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.800
And steel wool to just get it around.

38:10.800 --> 38:13.840
What you really can't do is get halfway through and give up.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.840
Just looks like a banker's visor down there.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.160
Are you wearing a surgeon's mask?

38:22.160 --> 38:23.040
What's going on?

38:23.040 --> 38:26.880
It's like a bloomin' onion down there.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.520
You got some hanging chad, it looks like.

38:29.520 --> 38:31.920
I got a Pez dispenser for penis.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.720
The only thing it dispenses is...

38:34.720 --> 38:36.240
Is he wearing a fanny pack?

38:36.240 --> 38:37.520
What's going on down there?

38:37.520 --> 38:38.480
Fanny pack, look.

38:39.360 --> 38:39.840
It's cool.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.360
It's like a visor.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.560
It's like a motorcycle helmet.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.360
You just lower it.

38:46.160 --> 38:46.880
No risk.

38:46.880 --> 38:47.280
No risk.

38:47.840 --> 38:48.240
Actually.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.320
To make your shroud of yuck.

38:50.320 --> 38:53.600
I would like to get a follow up on this, though.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.480
Yeah, I'd like to talk to that kid's dad.

38:56.480 --> 38:59.200
It would just be a Yahoo answer that just read, oh no.

38:59.200 --> 39:04.880
There's blood everywhere.

39:04.880 --> 39:09.600
I newly single, got a Joe Pesci penis down there.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.320
And I just went to work and I meet some ladies who are forgiving.

39:14.080 --> 39:17.440
Hey, hey, don't do this thing.

39:17.440 --> 39:20.560
If you're listening, sir, don't do it.

39:20.560 --> 39:23.520
It's good for us, but bad for you.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.120
I honestly don't think it's good for us.

39:25.120 --> 39:29.920
I think that like karmically, like from a Zen point of view, this is going to negatively

39:29.920 --> 39:31.200
affect everyone in the world.

39:32.160 --> 39:35.120
This one decision, like a butterfly flapping its wings.

39:35.120 --> 39:38.560
This is a snake eating its own horribly ruined dick.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.720
Get your mouth off of there, snake.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.120
Why is everybody?

39:45.120 --> 39:45.440
Can I?

39:46.080 --> 39:47.120
Are we living?

39:47.120 --> 39:55.680
OK, between this and the pizza roll challenge lady, I can't help but wonder, is there some

39:55.680 --> 40:02.400
like primal instinct need for adventure that is not being met, that we are somehow trying

40:02.400 --> 40:05.440
to generate danger in our lives?

40:05.440 --> 40:10.640
Like somehow it's overriding common sense to give us the feeling of being threatened.

40:10.640 --> 40:11.840
Like we need it.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.720
This kid is cutting off the tip of his penis to feel alive.

40:14.720 --> 40:20.960
Instead of going like spelunking or whitewater rafting, you ruin your, you ruin, you ruin

40:20.960 --> 40:21.680
your treasure.

40:22.960 --> 40:24.880
You ruin your gift.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.240
That was your gift.

40:26.240 --> 40:26.800
That God gave.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.080
That was your perfect flower.

40:28.640 --> 40:31.920
God gave you that gift to give to a special, your wife.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.200
And you know what you did?

40:33.760 --> 40:34.800
You unwrapped it early.

40:35.840 --> 40:36.640
You unwrapped that gift.

40:38.320 --> 40:39.120
You took the bow off.

40:39.120 --> 40:39.920
Took the bow off.

40:40.480 --> 40:41.760
Took the bow off.

40:41.760 --> 40:44.960
And then stabbed it over and over again.

40:46.960 --> 40:52.080
Now it just looks like those paper caps that you put on turkey legs at Thanksgiving.

40:52.080 --> 40:54.000
Now he's just going to be cold all the time.

40:55.040 --> 40:57.440
I've recently started a new relationship.

40:57.440 --> 41:02.000
Sometimes when I'm chatting with my boyfriend, something that I did with my ex or something

41:02.000 --> 41:03.680
that happened while we were together comes up.

41:04.240 --> 41:09.120
Seems kind of tactless to keep saying me and my ex did this or one time my ex said this.

41:09.120 --> 41:14.240
But I feel like I'm being disingenuous if I just say my friend, help me, my bim bam.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.120
Which do I use?

41:15.680 --> 41:20.320
Or do I just avoid these stories altogether and risk never having much to add to the

41:20.320 --> 41:22.640
conversation exed out in England?

41:22.640 --> 41:23.360
Whoa, bummer.

41:25.200 --> 41:30.160
This is, this is, wow, this is like, it's a weird, this could be written by our first

41:30.160 --> 41:31.600
question asker just like later.

41:32.800 --> 41:35.440
I think you might be selling yourself a little short here.

41:35.440 --> 41:41.440
I, I, I don't, I don't believe that anybody, regardless of how like into a relationship

41:41.440 --> 41:47.760
they've ever been, I don't think anybody only has stories about their ex or why, why

41:47.760 --> 41:49.680
do you like, why do you even have to address it?

41:49.680 --> 41:50.720
There was another person there.

41:50.720 --> 41:58.960
Like instead of saying like, Oh, me and chambers went and saw, um, we wouldn't saw men in black

41:58.960 --> 41:59.360
too.

41:59.360 --> 42:02.560
Why can't you just say I, yes, I have seen men in black too.

42:02.560 --> 42:03.520
And it was excellent.

42:03.520 --> 42:06.720
It's another, why can't you just use the dude's name?

42:06.720 --> 42:07.040
Yeah.

42:07.040 --> 42:10.240
Well, I mean, that's that's why can't you just drop it and be like, yeah.

42:10.240 --> 42:11.760
Chombers and I went and saw him.

42:11.760 --> 42:12.640
He's Chombers.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.080
He's going to is a unique.

42:14.080 --> 42:14.560
Yeah.

42:14.560 --> 42:15.360
Yeah.

42:15.360 --> 42:19.280
I mean, but why do you have to say my ex and I, well, that's not it's you're missing

42:19.280 --> 42:19.680
the point.

42:19.680 --> 42:23.840
I think it's not that they, the, it's not the terminology is trying to avoid it.

42:23.840 --> 42:26.000
It's the, the existence of chambers.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.080
This dude doesn't even, right.

42:28.080 --> 42:28.560
I see.

42:28.560 --> 42:30.240
How do you broach the subject?

42:30.240 --> 42:31.200
And the answer is you don't.

42:31.200 --> 42:33.520
Yeah, well, there's so many options here.

42:33.520 --> 42:33.840
Really.

42:33.840 --> 42:39.920
One is I think we've all heard a story that someone has told and then thought, oh, I wish

42:39.920 --> 42:41.040
that happened to me.

42:41.040 --> 42:45.200
And then like six months down the road, you tell that story and it did happen to you that

42:45.200 --> 42:45.680
time.

42:45.680 --> 42:46.640
Now it's happening to you.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.880
You just, you just repurpose the story.

42:50.080 --> 42:52.240
Do that, but outsource it to somebody.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.280
You can tell the story.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.960
It's just, it happened to other people.

42:55.520 --> 42:56.400
Oh, I see.

42:56.400 --> 42:56.560
Yeah.

42:56.560 --> 43:00.880
Then you have something to add in a little fiction, double line, basically, double lie.

43:00.880 --> 43:02.480
Super lie to him.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.840
This person you love and trust.

43:04.720 --> 43:05.440
Yeah.

43:05.440 --> 43:10.640
I think that in this circumstance, it's kind of, you gotta, you gotta dip your toe in the

43:10.640 --> 43:10.880
water.

43:10.880 --> 43:15.200
And like the first time you mention your ex, just see how your boyfriend reacts.

43:15.200 --> 43:16.880
And maybe he doesn't care.

43:16.880 --> 43:21.760
Like I don't care when Teresa mentions her ex-boyfriend, but she with me now and that's

43:21.760 --> 43:22.480
all that matters.

43:22.480 --> 43:22.640
Yeah.

43:22.640 --> 43:24.560
But you're very secure in your relationship.

43:24.560 --> 43:29.120
But if this is an early thing, you guys have been together for a while.

43:29.120 --> 43:30.640
You shouldn't be talking about it at all.

43:30.640 --> 43:31.040
You know?

43:31.040 --> 43:31.680
Yeah, right.

43:31.680 --> 43:36.320
I mean, you talk about it exactly once to get that out of the way.

43:36.320 --> 43:38.960
Like, yeah, I dated this dude.

43:38.960 --> 43:39.760
We live together.

43:40.320 --> 43:43.200
I resuscitated him back to health after his motorcycle crash.

43:43.840 --> 43:48.480
And we proposed to each other under the Parisian night sky.

43:49.280 --> 43:49.840
And maybe-

43:49.840 --> 43:53.920
I think you, I think you can go even vaguer and just say, I have dated before.

43:53.920 --> 43:57.200
We spent, we spent one entire day together in Venice.

43:57.200 --> 43:58.160
I met him on the train.

43:58.160 --> 43:59.360
He was a stranger.

43:59.360 --> 44:00.880
We fell deeply, deeply in love.

44:03.040 --> 44:07.440
That's, that is before, before Sunrise, the movie.

44:07.440 --> 44:08.480
That's not what I was thinking.

44:08.480 --> 44:09.280
That's not a real thing.

44:10.240 --> 44:10.720
No.

44:10.720 --> 44:11.840
I mean, it is, the movie is real.

44:11.840 --> 44:12.560
The movie is great.

44:12.560 --> 44:13.840
And let me just say delightful.

44:14.880 --> 44:17.760
There's a real great performances by Ethan Hawke.

44:17.760 --> 44:19.040
Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.

44:19.040 --> 44:20.160
Great work, guys.

44:20.160 --> 44:20.800
Keep it up.

44:20.800 --> 44:21.040
Yeah.

44:21.760 --> 44:23.360
I wish Ethan Embry had been in it.

44:23.360 --> 44:24.480
I'm trying to bring him back.

44:24.480 --> 44:25.040
Where'd he go?

44:26.000 --> 44:26.960
Where'd he go?

44:26.960 --> 44:28.160
I love that guy.

44:28.160 --> 44:29.440
Can't hardly wait.

44:29.440 --> 44:29.840
Great.

44:29.840 --> 44:31.360
Does that one have vampires in it?

44:31.920 --> 44:32.960
Can't hardly wait.

44:32.960 --> 44:34.160
Or before, before Sunrise.

44:34.880 --> 44:35.760
Yeah, it does.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.120
Cause that's, they're both vampires.

44:37.120 --> 44:38.800
They're both vampiric in nature.

44:38.800 --> 44:40.240
So it goes, it goes-

44:40.240 --> 44:41.440
It's, it's Sunrise.

44:41.440 --> 44:42.720
Before Sunrise.

44:42.720 --> 44:45.440
And then the second movie is from Dust Till Dawn.

44:46.400 --> 44:48.880
And then the third one is Twilight.

44:48.880 --> 44:49.040
Yeah.

44:49.760 --> 44:51.120
It's all-

44:51.120 --> 44:51.680
Keep it going.

44:51.680 --> 44:52.480
Keep it going, Trav.

44:52.480 --> 44:55.360
You got a Lost Boys, got a Lost Boys goof you can drop on us.

44:56.000 --> 44:56.640
No.

44:56.640 --> 44:58.000
Girlfriend, I think you're missing this goof.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.960
His goof was Times of Deck.

45:00.960 --> 45:02.080
It was Times of Deck.

45:02.080 --> 45:03.360
It was a good, it was a pretty good run.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.840
And we were looking for Times of Day.

45:05.840 --> 45:06.800
What about-

45:06.800 --> 45:07.200
Times of Day.

45:07.200 --> 45:08.560
That was a uniting theme.

45:09.520 --> 45:10.400
Times of Day.

45:12.240 --> 45:14.080
You just, just don't talk about it.

45:14.080 --> 45:14.480
No.

45:14.480 --> 45:15.440
Talk about other things.

45:15.440 --> 45:17.200
Tuesdays, Tuesdays with Morrie.

45:17.200 --> 45:18.000
That's, that's not-

45:18.000 --> 45:18.480
What?

45:18.480 --> 45:18.960
That's a day.

45:18.960 --> 45:20.080
Talk about Tuesdays with Morrie.

45:20.080 --> 45:20.800
It's a day of the week.

45:20.800 --> 45:21.680
I read the best book.

45:22.560 --> 45:23.520
Have you heard of this book?

45:23.520 --> 45:24.800
Didn't they make a movie?

45:24.800 --> 45:25.120
Yeah.

45:25.120 --> 45:28.960
With Owen Wilson and a dog.

45:28.960 --> 45:29.600
Yeah.

45:29.600 --> 45:31.200
Jack Lemmon was in it.

45:31.200 --> 45:31.840
Okay.

45:31.840 --> 45:35.520
In his final performance as an old man that's dying, which like, I get it, but-

45:36.480 --> 45:37.520
It was a little on the nose.

45:37.520 --> 45:38.640
Little on the nose, Jack.

45:39.440 --> 45:40.880
It was Jack Lemmon, wasn't it?

45:40.880 --> 45:42.560
It was either him or Matthau.

45:43.520 --> 45:45.040
They're really interchangeable, aren't they?

45:45.920 --> 45:47.040
Yeah, at this point.

45:47.040 --> 45:47.360
Yeah.

45:47.360 --> 45:49.280
I bet the two of them are getting into some hijinks up there.

45:49.280 --> 45:50.320
Oh, man.

45:50.320 --> 45:51.440
Do you think they live together?

45:51.440 --> 45:55.440
I would, I would say that, to, you know, get back to X'd out in England-

45:55.440 --> 45:55.760
All right.

45:56.880 --> 45:57.840
We're doing an advice show.

45:58.720 --> 45:59.760
Oh yeah, that's right.

45:59.760 --> 46:05.360
I, I, you know, if it comes up naturally, I don't think you need to be afraid to drop it.

46:05.360 --> 46:08.640
But if you're feeling uncomfortable doing it, then I don't think you feel the need,

46:08.640 --> 46:10.640
you need to feel the need to bring it up.

46:10.640 --> 46:12.560
You know, make new memories.

46:12.560 --> 46:13.920
Don't feel like you're being disingenuous.

46:13.920 --> 46:19.520
Just because it, I do think that like, no matter, no matter how secure somebody is,

46:19.520 --> 46:21.280
they don't want to hear you talk.

46:21.280 --> 46:23.520
They want to think about the fact that you used to be with somebody else,

46:23.520 --> 46:26.480
and they start, they don't want to hear you talking about it enough that

46:26.480 --> 46:29.440
they start to assume that you pine for that life still.

46:29.440 --> 46:31.760
And that may not be, I mean, that's not the most like,

46:31.760 --> 46:35.440
sort of mature reaction to somebody talking about their ex, but it's what we all do.

46:35.440 --> 46:38.800
I mean, it's, it's a very human, human reaction to it, I think.

46:39.600 --> 46:39.840
Yeah.

46:40.800 --> 46:43.440
This year is my first post-college Thanksgiving.

46:44.160 --> 46:48.320
Now that I'm in my own household, I'd like to bring a dish to the meal.

46:48.320 --> 46:52.960
However, all the traditional Thanksgiving sides and dessert are already taken.

46:52.960 --> 46:56.000
I don't drink wine, and there's already going to be a few bottles,

46:56.000 --> 46:59.040
so that's not a great option either.

46:59.680 --> 47:04.800
What should I bring to Thanksgiving dinner, stumped over stuffing?

47:04.800 --> 47:06.720
Your own, your smile.

47:06.720 --> 47:07.680
Bring your smile.

47:07.680 --> 47:10.080
I don't think that all the traditional things are taken.

47:10.080 --> 47:13.120
I think, I mean, they may be, the traditional things may be taken,

47:13.120 --> 47:16.080
but that doesn't mean you can't still knock it out of the park

47:16.080 --> 47:22.000
with a great dessert that people are just going to love.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.240
And I'm also going to point out, I've never made an entire traditional Thanksgiving meal,

47:26.240 --> 47:29.280
but I'm willing to bet that if you called the host or hostess and said,

47:29.280 --> 47:32.480
hey, I'd like to make something, they're more than happy.

47:32.480 --> 47:33.280
Oh sure, yeah.

47:33.280 --> 47:34.320
Shovel something off onto you.

47:34.320 --> 47:35.600
You know what I'm saying.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.440
Do you know my, do you know my power play?

47:38.160 --> 47:38.720
What's your power play?

47:38.720 --> 47:39.440
Bring a turkey.

47:40.640 --> 47:41.920
Small turkey?

47:41.920 --> 47:44.880
No, fuck that, a bigger turkey, a big buttery.

47:44.880 --> 47:45.920
Bring some turducken.

47:45.920 --> 47:46.560
Kill it.

47:46.560 --> 47:48.640
Kill their turkey with your turkey.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.800
Get a Texas-sized raptor turkey.

47:50.800 --> 47:54.640
They will never know it hit them because they will be lacerated by its claws and gobbler.

47:57.360 --> 47:58.960
So just bring a live turkey.

47:59.600 --> 48:02.800
I have two classic dessert options that I tend to go towards.

48:03.600 --> 48:04.720
Ritz torte.

48:04.720 --> 48:05.200
Nice.

48:05.200 --> 48:08.000
Bring a Ritz torte and people are just going to lose their minds over that.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.520
Or make chess bars, holiday favorite chess bars.

48:11.520 --> 48:16.640
Go get, our friends Dave and Alexander have a show called the DNA Foodcast and they did

48:17.920 --> 48:21.120
our mom's recipe for chess bars last week, I think.

48:22.080 --> 48:26.160
And that's like a, you bring that and it's just going to be the talk of the party.

48:26.160 --> 48:28.000
You know what's always a fan favorite?

48:28.720 --> 48:29.280
What's that?

48:29.280 --> 48:29.840
Cheesecake.

48:31.440 --> 48:32.480
It's not hard to make.

48:32.480 --> 48:33.040
It's a little.

48:33.040 --> 48:38.080
And there's a rocking like pumpkin cheesecake that you can make.

48:38.080 --> 48:39.280
It's absolutely delicious.

48:39.280 --> 48:41.520
Can you bring a novelty erotic cake?

48:42.960 --> 48:43.280
Yeah.

48:43.280 --> 48:43.840
Thanksgiving.

48:43.840 --> 48:44.960
Yeah, I think so.

48:44.960 --> 48:46.960
Oh, like, so like a turkey with a big boner.

48:46.960 --> 48:48.720
Big old boner turkey.

48:50.320 --> 48:53.760
It's like how kids used to make like the hand print turkeys only with a boner.

48:53.760 --> 48:58.400
And if you can somehow make this turkey speak and by which I mean, I don't mean a smaller

48:58.400 --> 49:03.120
speech bubble cake, but a literal, like some sort of voice recording, like they put in

49:03.120 --> 49:06.480
those gift cards where he's saying like, gobble, gobble.

49:06.480 --> 49:07.600
And he's like pointing to.

49:07.600 --> 49:08.240
Gobble it up.

49:08.240 --> 49:12.800
He's like pointing to his turkey boner and he's like pointing to it and saying that gobble.

49:13.440 --> 49:14.720
Like, have it.

49:14.720 --> 49:17.840
I guarantee you don't have to worry about anybody else having already made.

49:17.840 --> 49:19.760
Yeah, because they will have left the party.

49:19.760 --> 49:24.960
We had we had someone ask us on Twitter a couple of weeks ago, one of our dear, dear

49:24.960 --> 49:30.080
listeners saying, can you guys just for one episode cheese it with the dick talk so I

49:30.080 --> 49:31.840
can play this show for my family?

49:32.400 --> 49:34.000
And and the answer is no.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.120
The answer is no.

49:35.120 --> 49:36.240
It's definitive.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.960
No fish got to swim and birds got to fly.

49:38.960 --> 49:44.560
And we got to talk about those birds have big old boners because that boat is going

49:44.560 --> 49:45.280
to weigh it down.

49:46.160 --> 49:46.880
Yeah.

49:46.880 --> 49:51.200
Hey, hey, here's here's why don't you bring an empty stomach and a big and a big.

49:51.840 --> 49:53.120
Oh, bring your own Tupperware.

49:54.800 --> 49:56.400
I love it left over.

49:57.680 --> 50:00.000
I'm going to help you dispose of all this extra food.

50:00.000 --> 50:00.800
But you know what?

50:00.800 --> 50:05.280
Speaking as somebody who's been in that situation before, I would appreciate some wouldn't you

50:05.280 --> 50:09.600
Tupperware that way you don't have to worry about losing your Tupperware and you avoid

50:09.600 --> 50:13.040
the like, make sure I get this back, you know, kind of moment.

50:13.040 --> 50:14.080
It's like, oh, thanks.

50:14.080 --> 50:17.680
Now, don't just bring like a plastic grocery bag and scoop it in.

50:20.560 --> 50:22.720
I'll take three spoonfuls of everything.

50:22.720 --> 50:23.360
Hey, check this out.

50:23.360 --> 50:24.240
What do you guys think of this?

50:24.240 --> 50:25.040
This this move?

50:25.600 --> 50:28.240
Well, buy some cigars for the boys.

50:29.280 --> 50:29.600
Yeah.

50:30.320 --> 50:32.240
Hey, hey, the boys.

50:32.240 --> 50:34.720
I brought some cigars.

50:34.720 --> 50:35.520
Let's real nice.

50:35.520 --> 50:38.000
Let's go watch and some weed for the ladies.

50:39.360 --> 50:41.120
Ladies, we're going to watch.

50:41.120 --> 50:42.560
Ladies, I got you some weed.

50:42.560 --> 50:46.080
We're going to watch a football contest and smoke these stogies.

50:46.080 --> 50:47.920
You guys bake and bake.

50:51.440 --> 50:54.000
That turkey is going to taste especially awesome.

50:54.800 --> 50:57.200
This is the most awesome Thanksgiving ever.

50:58.000 --> 51:03.040
Why don't you go get there really early and tell him you brought your kitchen wisdom and

51:03.040 --> 51:08.960
then just say a bunch of folksy things as they're cooking to try them into doing a better job.

51:10.240 --> 51:13.600
I brought a stern hand and a judging eye.

51:13.600 --> 51:16.240
I brought an egg timer to make sure you don't mess anything up.

51:17.520 --> 51:21.200
Just bring a vacuum and an apron and be like, I'm here to clean up afterwards.

51:21.200 --> 51:24.000
I brought Sally Fields from fried green tomatoes.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.320
She is here to dispense all of her kitchen wisdom to you.

51:28.080 --> 51:30.960
I brought my own pillows for when I take a nap on your carpet.

51:30.960 --> 51:31.840
This is my Nana.

51:31.840 --> 51:34.240
I made her come to cook for you.

51:34.240 --> 51:36.080
She's got so much weed on her.

51:38.320 --> 51:39.840
Shake my Nana and the weed falls out.

51:41.200 --> 51:43.120
Nana baked face we call her.

51:43.120 --> 51:49.280
Hey, you know, if you're going to cook a turkey this year, let me tell you what you do.

51:51.680 --> 51:58.160
You make bacon the morning before and then you take the grease after you cook the bacon

51:58.160 --> 52:02.240
and then you pour it into a cup and you put the cup in the fridge.

52:02.240 --> 52:05.840
And then when you go to cook the turkey, you drink that.

52:05.840 --> 52:11.360
You cut slivers of the solidified bacon fat off and put it underneath the skin

52:12.160 --> 52:14.080
and then just throw some in the middle there.

52:14.080 --> 52:18.000
I know that's great because then the next day when you have leftover sandwiches,

52:18.000 --> 52:21.120
you just keep putting slivers of bacon grease on them until you die.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.360
Travis, do you just have a constantly regenerating supply of bacon grease?

52:25.360 --> 52:34.560
Yes, I have nine mason jars full of bacon grease and they're labeled Monday, Wednesday, Friday,

52:34.560 --> 52:39.680
special occasions, birthday, and then one that's kind of really old that just says the end.

52:39.680 --> 52:43.840
Do you realize that the way you talk on this show makes you sound like the fat Unabomber, right?

52:45.040 --> 52:47.680
Some of the things you say makes you sound like the fat Unabomber.

52:48.880 --> 52:51.120
I'm actually very in shape, very healthy.

52:51.120 --> 52:55.520
I'm saying you're trim but your mouth words make you sound like the fat Unabomber.

52:57.120 --> 53:05.040
I live my life like a Roman and that's my goal is to one day have a functioning vomitorium

53:06.320 --> 53:10.480
but for the time being, yes, don't eat bacon grease.

53:10.480 --> 53:14.320
If you eat bacon grease, then your whole house is a vomitorium.

53:14.320 --> 53:20.480
Is it sad that the other day I just bought myself a happy birthday ice cream cake for no reason?

53:20.480 --> 53:21.920
You bet. You bet it is.

53:21.920 --> 53:22.720
You got it right.

53:22.720 --> 53:23.280
Okay, that's a problem.

53:23.280 --> 53:25.120
Hey, Grif, do you have a Yahoo to cheer me up?

53:25.120 --> 53:25.620
Sure.

53:26.560 --> 53:28.640

53:28.640 --> 53:30.880
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Way, who asks,

53:32.320 --> 53:37.600
why are you girls so damn mean when it comes to size and don't give me that love crap?

53:40.320 --> 53:40.880
Okay, this-

53:40.880 --> 53:41.360
What?

53:41.360 --> 53:46.480
Okay, this girl told me that if a guy doesn't at least have a six inch penis erected,

53:46.480 --> 53:48.320
sorry about the dick talk, dad,

53:48.320 --> 53:52.480
then he better not have sex or show a girl his penis or they will laugh at him.

53:52.480 --> 53:55.360
I'm an 18 year old guy, fully through puberty,

53:55.360 --> 54:01.440
and I have a 5.1 to 5.5 inch ranging on good and bad days, but that's-

54:03.440 --> 54:04.400
Depending on the weather.

54:04.400 --> 54:06.800
That's usually where I am, so I'm really nervous.

54:06.800 --> 54:09.840
Also, it's not just this one girl, it's a lot of girls who say this.

54:09.840 --> 54:13.440
Well, step one, stop asking girls if they like your dick.

54:14.880 --> 54:15.520
Here's the thing.

54:15.520 --> 54:15.520
What?

54:15.520 --> 54:20.080
Isn't that- the human race has been propagating itself that way for thousands of years.

54:21.280 --> 54:22.560
Don't look. Just don't look.

54:23.360 --> 54:26.560
Also, you did not hear the latest census data.

54:26.560 --> 54:31.280
The average has actually gone down a little bit to 5.8 inches, so-

54:31.280 --> 54:31.840
Yeah.

54:31.840 --> 54:32.320
You're-

54:32.320 --> 54:33.360
Slightly below average.

54:33.360 --> 54:35.520
You're a little bit closer on your good days.

54:38.080 --> 54:39.600
You're heavier than I am.

54:39.600 --> 54:40.400
You're heavy flow days.

54:40.400 --> 54:41.120
Hey, how's your day?

54:41.120 --> 54:41.920
Go on.

54:41.920 --> 54:42.480
Not great.

54:45.280 --> 54:46.000
How good hanging?

54:46.720 --> 54:48.000
About 0.4 inches.

54:48.000 --> 54:48.720
Fully erect.

54:49.520 --> 54:50.320
Fully erected.

54:51.760 --> 54:53.680
That is a lot of-

54:53.680 --> 54:54.240
Variation.

54:54.960 --> 54:57.360
That's a very specific measurement.

54:57.360 --> 54:59.840
On the good day, he still had the tip.

54:59.840 --> 55:00.800
On the bad day.

55:02.800 --> 55:07.280
I get myself a circumcision using alcohol and scissors, so now all my days are bad.

55:07.280 --> 55:11.520
But that one particular day was the worst.

55:14.080 --> 55:15.280
They haven't gotten much better.

55:17.120 --> 55:19.120
Ladies, don't give me that love crap.

55:20.400 --> 55:21.360
Wait, why is there-

55:21.360 --> 55:21.920
Why are you all such size queens?

55:21.920 --> 55:23.360
I don't know why that's a test.

55:23.360 --> 55:23.840
We just-

55:26.000 --> 55:30.320
Can we just be cool for a second about dick sizes?

55:30.320 --> 55:32.080
Can we just chill out about it?

55:32.080 --> 55:36.640
Like, if one guy's arms are shorter than another guy's arms,

55:36.640 --> 55:38.800
you don't go, hey pussy.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.320
I don't see why a dick has to be any different.

55:43.280 --> 55:47.440
To be fair though, I do judge a girl on the size of her vagina.

55:47.440 --> 55:48.240
God.

55:48.240 --> 55:48.800
Come on.

55:49.520 --> 55:50.080
Come on.

55:50.960 --> 55:51.280
Wait.

55:54.160 --> 55:54.960
Width or depth?

55:56.000 --> 55:56.560
Come on.

55:56.560 --> 55:57.040
Come on.

55:58.240 --> 55:59.760
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

55:59.760 --> 56:02.400
First, few little housekeeping notes.

56:02.400 --> 56:10.960
We have a new t-shirt at maxfundstore.com, so you can go pick that up and still get the

56:10.960 --> 56:14.000
blue MBMBAM adventure shirt.

56:15.920 --> 56:22.720
Got a Twitter feed, it's at MBMBAM.

56:22.720 --> 56:27.120
Follow that to find out when the show is out.

56:27.120 --> 56:31.680
It's your- we post there just as soon as it goes live.

56:31.680 --> 56:34.560
Thank you to people who are tweeting about the show.

56:34.560 --> 56:45.360
Scratty Bones, Dan UNG, Alex Sphere, HooliganD89, Rilla Wida, Seekil Gore, Gaddy James, Jack

56:45.360 --> 56:46.880
Diggy, Synergy.

56:46.880 --> 56:52.560
A lot of people were a little upset that Griffin was so mean about metal music.

56:53.120 --> 56:54.320
I apologize.

56:54.320 --> 56:57.520
Some people really turned me on to some good stuff.

56:57.520 --> 56:58.080
Like-

56:58.080 --> 56:58.640
Really?

56:58.640 --> 56:59.760
Yeah, like Hate Blood.

57:01.680 --> 57:02.160
Pretty good.

57:04.320 --> 57:06.240
Devil Puke.

57:07.360 --> 57:09.520
Devil Puke is really is great.

57:09.520 --> 57:12.720
And of course, Rose Zephyr.

57:12.720 --> 57:17.200
Lots of fun people are out there talking about the show.

57:17.200 --> 57:20.960
Use MBMBAM hashtag to talk about it.

57:20.960 --> 57:25.280
And happy birthday, anniversary, and Thanksgiving to Lindsay from Davin.

57:25.920 --> 57:26.640
Yeah.

57:26.640 --> 57:27.280
What?

57:27.280 --> 57:27.920
I want-

57:27.920 --> 57:28.720
Yeah, cut that out.

57:29.360 --> 57:29.920
Yeah, cut that out.

57:29.920 --> 57:30.720
What are you doing?

57:30.720 --> 57:31.440
I don't know.

57:31.440 --> 57:39.520
I want to thank Genesis Today for endorsing our program after I in turn endorsed their

57:39.520 --> 57:46.000
delicious and nutritious immunity boosting super fruit gummies available in your Walgreens.

57:46.000 --> 57:51.360
You get, guys, you get 50 for $10.49. How's your health?

57:51.360 --> 57:52.320
It's pretty good.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.640
$200 will get you on the Jumbotron.

57:58.640 --> 58:02.720
Full disclosure, we are getting a whole suite of Genesis Today products for that.

58:04.560 --> 58:06.400
I said, they said, do you want this?

58:06.400 --> 58:10.400
And I said, for Christ's sake, yes, yes, I need to keep Travis alive.

58:12.720 --> 58:13.680
He needs to live.

58:13.680 --> 58:16.320
We have, okay, real quick stuff.

58:16.320 --> 58:18.880
We will not be doing a show next week.

58:18.880 --> 58:23.440
We're going to spend some time with our families and we're all going to be traveling and Thanksgiving,

58:23.440 --> 58:25.360
and you don't really need us anyway.

58:25.360 --> 58:28.160
You should enjoy the love and bosom of your family.

58:28.160 --> 58:29.440
Get your shopping started.

58:31.040 --> 58:37.360
If you want to get a personal ad, like Davin was kind of up to do for Lindsay, go to maximumfun.org

58:37.360 --> 58:38.560
forward slash Jumbotron.

58:38.560 --> 58:42.240
While you're there, why not check out all of the great MaxFun products.

58:42.240 --> 58:44.080
All of the great MaxFun programming.

58:44.080 --> 58:45.120
Stop podcasting yourself.

58:45.120 --> 58:48.320
Judge John Hodgman, Sonny Young America, Jordan, Jesse go.

58:48.320 --> 58:49.120
So much good stuff.

58:49.680 --> 58:50.320
Two things.

58:50.320 --> 58:53.200
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Windage for the use of their song.

58:53.200 --> 58:54.720
It's a departure off the album.

58:54.720 --> 59:00.080
Putting the days to bed, uh, as, as the theme song, it's our theme song, right?

59:00.080 --> 59:00.880
The beginning of the show.

59:00.880 --> 59:02.800
And it's so great and buy their albums.

59:02.800 --> 59:03.440
And thank you.

59:04.000 --> 59:09.120
Second thing we have a location for our live show in Austin, Texas, and tickets are going

59:09.120 --> 59:14.080
to go on sale, um, sometime this week, um, probably near the middle of the week.

59:14.080 --> 59:14.880
So keep an eye out.

59:14.880 --> 59:15.920
We'll announce it on Twitter.

59:16.480 --> 59:20.000
Um, uh, so it's not a huge venue.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.520
So those tickets are going to go fast.

59:21.520 --> 59:22.480
The blue theater.

59:22.480 --> 59:24.480
If you live in Austin, that's where it is.

59:25.040 --> 59:29.440
Uh, we'll probably go someplace after the show and get drinks and, uh, yeah, come on

59:29.440 --> 59:29.600
out.

59:29.600 --> 59:32.400
Cause it's going to be, it's going to be a real fun time.

59:32.400 --> 59:33.520
Um, but keep an eye on that.

59:33.520 --> 59:34.720
Where is that again, Griffin?

59:34.720 --> 59:36.240
So people can start making plans.

59:36.240 --> 59:42.880
It's on East Austin, right off airport Google map at Google map at you.

59:42.880 --> 59:43.600
Lazy fucks.

59:44.480 --> 59:46.000
What day are we planning on Sunday?

59:46.000 --> 59:48.640
December the 11th is the day of the show.

59:48.640 --> 59:49.920
We're going to put tickets on sale.

59:50.480 --> 59:51.120
We have to do that.

59:51.120 --> 59:54.480
We'll simultaneously put the link up on Twitter and our Facebook.

59:54.480 --> 59:58.640
So, and on the, but it is a, it is not a big venue.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:05.680
So, uh, uh, you want to act fast to get those tickets and, uh, God, I'm so fucking excited.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.800
I can't wait to see everyone.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.360
Uh, yeah, that's all.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.480
That's all on my end.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.920
Oh, it's also Movember.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.880
I, uh, we would appreciate your Movember donations.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:20.480
You can just go to us.movember.com and search for either Justin or I, uh, we're both participating.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.600
I'm growing a mustache.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.600
Mine looks pretty fucking dope.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.040
Yeah.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:31.360
Except for the part where you look like you are, are you about to talk smack about my mustache

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:38.320
because I still haven't seen yours while I'm saving it up in a jar in the jar.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:43.680
We keep our mustaches until the live show and then I will shave to a mustache for the

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.160
live show.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.200
Keep my mustache for live show.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.960
Justin need a firm commitment.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.360
I will be divorced.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.840
I will be a single man with a mustache.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:55.760
I keep it one moment longer than 1201 December 1st.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.080
Uh, thank you guys so much for listening to the show.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.320
As always, we do this for you to entertain you and make you happy.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.360
And we really love it that so many of you tune in.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.880
Um, and so thank you very much.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.680
And thanks to Dan.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.640
Do we mentioned Dan Savage last week for, for.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.000
I don't remember, but let's thank him again.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:15.040
Yeah.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:20.000
Thanks for, for mentioning our show, giving it the plug on your, on your podcast post,

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.680
um, on your site.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.840
Uh, you can track down Dan Savage, but let's be honest.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.520
You probably already know who he is.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.520
And thanks again to our friend Brent O'Floss.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.880
Oh yeah, thanks Brent.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.960
See his videos and his web comic, uh, at Brent O'Floss.com.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.640
Make sure you check all that stuff out.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.200
Okay.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.400
Griffin, I'm ready.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:38.880
This hit me.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.360
This final Yahoo is sent in by Alethea Eckhart.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.240
Thank you, Alethea.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.840
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.800
Ah, fuck.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:51.200
JKFNBM, who asks, what would be a good tattoo inspired by the book, The Time Traveler's Wife?

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.440
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.560
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:57.680
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.200
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.160
It's your dad.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.200
Square on the lips.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.720
Keep your heart, Three Stacks.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.680
Keep your heart.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.840
Hey, keep your heart, Three Stacks.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:10.880
Keep your heart.

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.160
Man, these girls are smart.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.000
Three Stacks, these girls are smart.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:26.800
Three Stacks, play your part, play your part.
