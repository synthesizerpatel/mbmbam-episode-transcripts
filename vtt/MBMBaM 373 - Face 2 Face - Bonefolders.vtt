WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.580
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.580 --> 00:10.940
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:10.940 --> 00:16.300
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

00:16.300 --> 00:20.580
cool they are for listening.

00:20.580 --> 00:21.580
What's up, you cool baby?

00:21.580 --> 00:31.000
Howdy!

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Oh

00:33.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
Welcome to my brother my brother mean advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm your middle is brother Travis McElroy

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
And I'm your sweet baby brother 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Hey, can we can we vape in here or what?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I

01:32.500 --> 01:35.980
Heard ten people say no, that's enough. That's a quorum

01:37.040 --> 01:38.320
so

01:38.320 --> 01:40.040
This is our

01:40.040 --> 01:42.040
fourth show in three days

01:42.360 --> 01:43.960
which

01:43.960 --> 01:46.000
the road the road

01:47.240 --> 01:53.800
For real artists that would not seem like a lot of work. No, we've done four. We've done four hours of work

01:53.800 --> 02:01.400
In three days like that. It's not that bad. It's not that bad. I did saw bones though. So I'm actually a four and a half

02:02.640 --> 02:09.600
Now for lesser artists that would mean finally about to get home gonna just phone this one in

02:11.040 --> 02:13.040
But for us it means

02:13.040 --> 02:18.040
I

02:21.120 --> 02:25.180
Okay, one day I hope to be as confident as that person was

02:27.200 --> 02:33.280
To shout get drunk in a very big crowded dark. I was gonna say get weird

02:33.280 --> 02:39.280
Which I hope you've all learned the folly of yelling shit cuz you never know what I'm gonna say next

02:39.280 --> 02:44.280
So don't try to get incorrect where I'm gonna go cuz you better get it, right now had you gotten it, right?

02:44.280 --> 02:46.280
You would have won

02:47.280 --> 02:49.280
$1,000

02:49.280 --> 02:56.280
American American dollars. I'm in our content in an effort to get weird. I have done my Judd Nelson cosplay

02:57.280 --> 02:59.280
Sure

02:59.280 --> 03:03.280
Oh my god, you did just put that on for this show. There's like a new look. Yeah

03:04.280 --> 03:06.280
Cuz I love you. So, uh

03:07.280 --> 03:14.280
We're so happy to be here back in the Wilbur for like ages since we've been back in the world

03:14.280 --> 03:19.280
I know for our fourth performance at the Wilbur in beautiful, Boston, Massachusetts

03:19.280 --> 03:25.280
Um as we were driving in today, uh, well we from the airport, um, I saw

03:26.280 --> 03:33.280
Something happen here in Boston that made me the happiest I've ever been and it was that at the Boston Tea Party

03:34.280 --> 03:36.280
boat exhibit thing museum

03:37.280 --> 03:39.280
Sometimes they call them history museums

03:40.280 --> 03:42.280
There was a

03:42.280 --> 03:49.280
Box that people are encouraged to throw off the boat and then reel back in on a rope

03:51.280 --> 03:53.280
Which I do not think they made them do

03:54.280 --> 03:57.280
Very funny Gregory now pull it back up

03:58.280 --> 04:00.280
You've made your point to the British

04:01.280 --> 04:06.280
But I do what I do want some tea. I am thirsty. Do you think that's a good idea?

04:06.280 --> 04:11.280
After the tea party where they're like, hell yeah, we did it and then right after like man. I would like some tea though

04:12.280 --> 04:15.280
Oh, man, the river smells like nap time, man

04:17.280 --> 04:22.280
All our tea in why did we save some tea you think that what one guy was like listen

04:22.280 --> 04:24.280
I'm into all of this. So

04:25.280 --> 04:29.280
Definitely definitely into it. My mom sent me this camomile tea

04:29.280 --> 04:35.280
In this box here that I've got here. So all this great do it all

04:36.280 --> 04:40.280
Definitely story of tonight totally into it got a sore throat. Yeah, if I could just get a bag

04:41.280 --> 04:46.280
Save me a little bit of the camera scene. So we're gonna be leaving it all

04:47.280 --> 04:50.280
Out on the court tonight and we're very excited about that

04:50.280 --> 04:58.280
I think what we've talked about it is we're gonna go for a little bit and then we're just gonna do a fuck ton of audience questions

04:59.280 --> 05:02.280
Cuz I usually go so super good

05:02.280 --> 05:09.280
It's so we're gonna we're gonna hear them all out tonight. And so should we yeah, I should say

05:10.280 --> 05:12.280
We're gonna get weak

05:12.280 --> 05:19.280
Please remain calm only one of us can be weird at a time

05:20.280 --> 05:22.280
And it's our turn

05:23.280 --> 05:30.280
We've earned this bad show. You're about to see no, it's gonna be good. We're gonna tonight we fix it all we're gonna fix everything

05:31.280 --> 05:35.280
So hold on. There's a lot wrong. There's a lot wrong

05:35.280 --> 05:41.280
We can't get with tonight. We will fix 90% of everything. Yes. I love that. That's good

05:41.280 --> 05:44.280
We can stick with that. But first we're gonna get into some questions that were sent into us

05:45.280 --> 05:50.280
From our audience. What we do is we take your questions and turn them out could be like into wisdom

05:51.280 --> 05:53.280
And we're experts

05:53.280 --> 05:54.280
so

05:54.280 --> 05:59.280
My mom's co-worker recently came to me and she was like, oh my god, you know what?

05:59.280 --> 06:07.280
And we're experts so my mom's co-worker recently came to her asking advice about a situation

06:08.280 --> 06:16.280
She thinks someone has physically snuck into her house Pink Panther style and passworded her Wi-Fi so she can't use it

06:20.280 --> 06:22.280
The perfect crime

06:22.280 --> 06:28.280
She doesn't believe that there's a password that comes with the unit and instead wants to install

06:29.280 --> 06:32.280
Security cameras and get a whole new laptop to catch this apparent

06:33.280 --> 06:34.280
security camera

06:34.280 --> 06:38.280
How would the security cameras connect to the laptop is question number one, right?

06:39.280 --> 06:41.280
Just plug in a VHS recorder. Yeah

06:42.280 --> 06:50.280
How do we convince her that there is no ninja but instead just look at the user manual and that's from Aaron

06:50.280 --> 06:56.280
I mean what you just said sounds like a pretty good start. Yeah, I I wish I wish

06:57.280 --> 07:00.280
Listen, I like myself a lot. Okay

07:01.280 --> 07:03.280
Kicking off with that full stop

07:03.280 --> 07:06.280
I can't imagine being in a scenario where I was like, yeah

07:06.280 --> 07:12.280
I'm having trouble with the the password is somebody said it and somebody said the very reasonable

07:12.280 --> 07:16.280
Oh, it comes pre-programmed and I said no

07:16.280 --> 07:20.280
Must be a burglar situation. Must be a ninja

07:21.280 --> 07:23.280
My Ben Oceans 14. Yeah

07:24.280 --> 07:28.280
Fucking Clooney got in here perfect crime got in here without a trace

07:29.280 --> 07:34.280
Put a Wi-Fi password without a trace except for the sticker that he left at the bottom of the router that tells you what the fucking

07:34.280 --> 07:37.280
Default password is. That's what he wants you to think

07:37.280 --> 07:42.280
That's what he wants you to think if he falls in love with Catherine Zeta Jones because of this password sticker

07:42.280 --> 07:46.280
You should okay you should are you here?

07:47.280 --> 07:49.280
No, okay, cool

07:50.280 --> 07:53.280
They must have been so distraught about this that they couldn't make it

07:53.280 --> 07:57.280
You should not if you're listening to this later. You should not stop this from happening

07:57.280 --> 08:04.280
Yes, because the end result is going to be that this person is going to set up cameras on a laptop and

08:05.280 --> 08:11.280
Then the password will be there again and they will spend the rest of their lives reviewing that film

08:11.280 --> 08:17.280
Right. Yeah trying to spot trying to spot a frame old st. Nick sneaks in

08:18.280 --> 08:23.280
Um, is this wait? No. Okay. Nobody wanted to jog it back and talk about it right there. You see it, right?

08:23.280 --> 08:28.280
That's your cat. No, it looks like my cat. No, that's my password

08:28.280 --> 08:31.280
I've spent seven years reviewing the film

08:31.280 --> 08:34.280
It couldn't be anything other than the cat

08:34.280 --> 08:41.280
Now I want to say don't do this because why are people so eager to remove these wonderful angels from my life?

08:41.280 --> 08:45.280
Yes, although my boss says busting nut and but in the wrong way

08:45.280 --> 08:52.280
Should I correct them and it's like always know because I'm a person alive in the world and I want to know that they exist

08:52.280 --> 08:58.280
I'd like a little magic please. Yeah save some for the rest of us. How about a Yahoo answer? Yes

08:58.280 --> 09:02.280
This one was sent in by Caitlin. Thank you, Caitlin. It's from Yahoo answers user anonymous

09:02.280 --> 09:08.280
I'm telling you like 90% of Yahoo answers users are like I love getting bad advice from stuff

09:08.280 --> 09:10.280
But I don't want my name attached to it

09:11.280 --> 09:13.280
We will call them Ron

09:15.280 --> 09:19.280
Ronald asks can a dolphin tell if you're hungover?

09:19.280 --> 09:23.280
Ronald asks can a dolphin tell if you're hungover?

09:29.280 --> 09:33.280
Okay, wait before before we answer that question I

09:34.280 --> 09:39.280
Have another question, which is how could you tell if the dolphin could tell yeah?

09:41.280 --> 09:46.280
That's why they're asking Yahoo answers and this was easy to discern they would have yeah, no, that's fair

09:46.280 --> 09:53.280
But like if like that dolphin is kind of side-eyeing me. Yeah, I think he knows

09:54.280 --> 10:00.280
Okay, you laugh and I heard thank you for that. It is a comedy show but like also

10:02.280 --> 10:04.280
Maybe

10:05.280 --> 10:07.280
They are the smartest creature

10:07.280 --> 10:12.280
Yeah, it's not only that they have a sort of energy about them or just like if any animal could tell I was hungover

10:12.280 --> 10:19.280
It would be a doll. How cool is your life? By the way, where you have a dolphin meeting opportunity and you do not step

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
completely correct to it

10:22.160 --> 10:23.520
like if I

10:23.520 --> 10:29.360
Then I'm gonna be the dolphin. I'm gonna be my best me. Yeah, I'm gonna spend five days just practicing my petting motion

10:29.360 --> 10:32.920
Yes, I'm gonna have an updated of resume with me. Yeah

10:32.920 --> 10:40.560
I okay. So here's what I'm thinking. You're right in the dolphin. Slow down. Slow down. Oh, wait. Oh, oh

10:42.360 --> 10:45.920
Wait, how one more time show me how you're right in the dolphin

10:46.880 --> 10:51.620
Which sounds like a euphemism, but it in BNB am ride the dog the dolphin

10:51.920 --> 10:56.080
So you get on the dolphin if you think about it, your mouth is gonna be directly over

10:58.080 --> 11:02.200
I'm drawing an imaginary column of breath air from my mouth to the bowl

11:02.200 --> 11:06.120
Oh, so the air is gonna be going from your mouth to the blowhole

11:06.960 --> 11:09.720
You know, what are you what's wrong? Nothing? You're fine, right?

11:09.720 --> 11:12.760
Okay, so you're the air is going from your mouth through the blowhole. Does it?

11:12.760 --> 11:17.040
Okay, are there any scientists here who can tell me if they breathe air in through the blowhole?

11:18.720 --> 11:24.560
It's not called a suck hole some I know a few you just yelled and I also wanted to say I know you're not fucking

11:24.640 --> 11:31.200
Scientists, I don't think I don't think Lisa Frank would do quite so many stickers of this animal if they had an appendage called

11:31.200 --> 11:33.200
a suck hole I

11:40.640 --> 11:45.240
Don't think Sega would have made echo the dolphin if it had a suck hole on it

11:47.240 --> 11:53.040
You're gonna come up against there's kind of a barrier there the rocks are down you're gonna have to use your suck hole powers

11:53.580 --> 11:57.060
Suck in the blow pit fish with your suck hole. Just shoot it at the evil

11:57.060 --> 12:02.700
Yeah, there were like fucking scary aliens in that game. You remember it you think oh, it's just peaceful swim

12:02.700 --> 12:04.700
No one remembers echo the dolphin

12:13.020 --> 12:15.020
But could they because

12:15.500 --> 12:23.140
Would they a lot of times dolphins do seem to be judgy? Yeah. Oh, yeah, and I wonder what I mean other than the fact that

12:23.140 --> 12:24.340
they've got

12:24.340 --> 12:28.620
Basically way chiller lives than us. I don't know what they're lording over

12:28.620 --> 12:33.260
I think if the dolphin could tell they wouldn't be cool about it, right? No way

12:34.660 --> 12:36.660
They get up in your ear and like

12:38.780 --> 12:40.780
God I I

12:42.020 --> 12:44.020
Meet at a dolphin once

12:44.740 --> 12:46.740
And I was not hungover

12:47.060 --> 12:49.540
But I had extremely bad diarrhea

12:49.540 --> 12:53.180
Diarrhea, so it was a Tuesday and

12:55.620 --> 12:57.700
The dolphin didn't say anything so

12:58.820 --> 13:00.420
We're good

13:00.420 --> 13:05.060
We're good folks now. Okay, you didn't have diarrhea on the dolphin, right?

13:06.340 --> 13:10.620
If I did, I don't think I'd be talking about it in front of my 1000 new friends Justin

13:10.620 --> 13:14.340
No, I don't think I'd tell my I diarrhea on a dolphin story to my

13:14.340 --> 13:18.780
Room full of 1,000 strangers Justin. I don't think I would do that there

13:18.780 --> 13:23.900
But I am trying to establish the premise that all you've proven is that dolphins cannot sense that

13:24.780 --> 13:27.280
prior to and directly after

13:27.820 --> 13:32.700
You will the your dolphin experience you'll be having very liquid and frequent bowel movements

13:32.700 --> 13:38.480
Why the fuck are we using dogs to sniff shit out? We just be walking dolphins through airports. Yeah

13:39.900 --> 13:43.300
Yes, we should Travis be walking dolphins through airports

13:43.300 --> 13:45.300
You're right

13:45.780 --> 13:47.980
We'd build them a suit

13:49.980 --> 13:51.980
Idiot

13:53.980 --> 13:59.780
Fuck me, I guess I'm the asshole our household vacuum while still functional in a technical sense

13:59.780 --> 14:02.100
Isn't quite a great suck hole on it that vacuum

14:03.860 --> 14:08.700
Isn't quite what it used to be since my housemates sucked up an entire crew length sock with it

14:08.700 --> 14:13.500
Which he left for me to discover and extract after weeks of shrugging non-committally

14:14.220 --> 14:16.500
Every time I wondered aloud why the suction was so bad

14:16.500 --> 14:22.140
I continued to do my best with what we had feeling that I wasn't in a financial position to purchase a new vacuum

14:22.140 --> 14:27.900
But my mother recently took pity on me and my dust-bound purgatory and purchased one for me on the condition

14:28.340 --> 14:31.520
That my sock vacuuming housemate never be allowed to use it

14:32.260 --> 14:35.180
what are some lies I can tell my housemate about the

14:35.180 --> 14:40.060
Powerful highly efficient vacuum sounds coming from my room every Sunday

14:42.300 --> 14:47.380
How do I keep him from discovering the new appliance and taking another

14:48.660 --> 14:50.660
vacuum

14:50.860 --> 14:52.860
It's like back who's that from

14:53.740 --> 14:57.740
The sheet is disappeared. Let's move. All right, kill the bow. Are you here?

14:59.980 --> 15:02.220
Is the problem with having an early show on a late show

15:02.220 --> 15:04.340
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we've caught so

15:06.540 --> 15:13.220
Why first of all, nobody vacuums there anything once a week that is the most buckwild thing how much dust are you

15:13.860 --> 15:15.860
generating pink pin

15:16.380 --> 15:18.220
I

15:18.220 --> 15:22.780
Don't think your roommate will be too upset about the fact that they don't have to vacuum anymore

15:22.900 --> 15:23.420
Yeah

15:23.420 --> 15:29.500
I don't think you need a fabrication for like I'm just gonna vacuum the house from now on the entire apartment is me. I

15:29.500 --> 15:36.360
Wish I could have been inside your roommate's head the first time you use the vacuum

15:36.980 --> 15:44.080
post-sock experiment and you said huh? What do you think's wrong with this and they went

15:48.700 --> 15:55.300
I wish I could be inside your roommate's head when they were vacuuming and they saw a big full-length sock on the ground and they

15:55.300 --> 15:57.300
were like

15:57.300 --> 16:00.520
I don't want to fucking pick it. Oh, whatever

16:02.020 --> 16:07.140
Yeah, because it was not yeah, I think you you very generously say it was mistaken in here

16:07.140 --> 16:11.800
It was not your your roommate looked at the sock and looked at where the hamper was

16:12.580 --> 16:17.000
Actually, fuck this get a quick cost-benefit analysis of winding down to get the sock

16:17.500 --> 16:19.740
Yeah, they always show you in the commercials though

16:19.740 --> 16:25.860
How many socks they can pick up and suck you going they shouldn't put that in the commercials because it's like look sock after sock

16:25.860 --> 16:32.660
It just sucks these bad boys up and eat some for lunch. I know we don't I'm gonna get a little weird and advocate a

16:33.100 --> 16:36.400
Direct approach. I'm pretty sure if you look at your roommate and say yeah

16:36.400 --> 16:40.980
My mom bought me this after you broke my last one and she doesn't want me to let you use it

16:41.580 --> 16:47.180
That's a pretty good explanation because you're a fiend. You can continue to use the awful vacuum. Yeah

16:47.780 --> 16:49.420
like I

16:49.420 --> 16:52.820
Would say that you should not be direct if it weren't for the fact

16:52.820 --> 16:57.820
Your roommate did leave it for you to find it. Yeah, they not only intentionally sucked it up

16:57.820 --> 17:04.260
They left it as a little mystery for you to uncover. They have lost vacuum privilege. That's right. They don't deserve it

17:04.260 --> 17:07.900
I would be down. I love to lose vacuum privilege. Yeah, right

17:09.060 --> 17:14.500
This is sort of like how I used to fake an allergy to Windex at blockbuster like you if you do yes

17:15.140 --> 17:19.220
if if you do a bad enough job at something eventually people just I

17:19.220 --> 17:25.800
swore for two years at blockbuster that no one had trained me how to vacuum and the only time you vacuum at blockbuster is

17:26.020 --> 17:29.660
1215 in the morning because you closed at midnight and that's the last thing that happens

17:29.660 --> 17:34.220
So nobody's gonna be like 1215 time to train this pudgy liar how to vacuum

17:35.460 --> 17:39.140
They'll just go ahead and vacuum for you. So I went two years without ever learning

17:40.500 --> 17:42.500
Anyway

17:42.500 --> 17:49.540
Selfie hey, that's a little distracting but go back. Let's do it. Okay. Here. Hi

17:52.740 --> 18:00.820
Okay, how about a yahoo? Yeah, this one's in him by level 9,000. Yeah, I

18:03.860 --> 18:05.860
Can do better than that

18:06.220 --> 18:09.940
Level 9,000. Yeah, Drew Drew at Drew Davenport. Thank you. Drew. Did you?

18:09.940 --> 18:11.620
say

18:11.620 --> 18:17.820
You say Drew thief. No, I said Drew Davenport and it's from yahoo answers user young spongy

18:17.820 --> 18:37.820
Who asks what's in your dream stable?

18:39.820 --> 18:44.360
For our equine science class my friend and I have to decide what

18:44.360 --> 18:46.800
Good point Travis

18:47.840 --> 18:53.160
My friend and I have to design our very own dream stable. We've chosen to be a boarding facility

18:53.160 --> 18:57.200
Apparently we have unlimited money. So we get to spend obscene and offensive amounts of money

18:57.200 --> 19:00.480
Here's all the stuff. We have a for a somewhat class obscene and offensive

19:02.960 --> 19:04.960
It's just ten wieners, I

19:05.680 --> 19:06.840
Don't know anything

19:06.840 --> 19:14.720
We have all the stuff for a somewhat classy little boarding facility indoor outdoor arenas designated riding pastures trails a bunch of other boring stuff

19:16.720 --> 19:19.360
We've included the prices of manure spread. Nope still boring

19:19.480 --> 19:25.360
Is there anything I'm missing or anything fancy and so frivolous that my friend and I just must include my mom suggested

19:25.480 --> 19:27.480
chandeliers in the indoor and barns

19:30.840 --> 19:32.840
Yeah, you just read the last line I

19:32.840 --> 19:38.360
I thought that'd be pretty fun. My friend and I are gonna show Obama how to really spend billions

19:46.920 --> 19:48.920
I

19:50.280 --> 19:55.800
Look at him sitting there so smug thinking he knows how to spend billions. We'll show him. I

19:56.840 --> 20:00.880
Hope he does get this documentation somehow. He's like, well, these ain't me good

20:00.880 --> 20:06.080
Got me no one no offense intended. Well tough shit

20:07.920 --> 20:13.000
Thanks, you're welcome, um, what's in your dreams stable dreams

20:14.120 --> 20:20.360
Chandelier feels like a cheat because you should at least put something in that I can imagine the horses could give a shit about

20:20.720 --> 20:21.840
Yeah

20:21.840 --> 20:26.800
They I don't even know. I'm not a horse genius, but I don't think they could look up at him

20:26.800 --> 20:33.200
If they're directly above I'm not sure a horse could get up there to sneak a peek is what I would say

20:33.200 --> 20:39.720
Not an angle, of course. I need a chart. But if you imagine a horse, okay, okay. No, never mind. I'm done

20:40.120 --> 20:42.560
So maybe some fancy sconces instead

20:44.080 --> 20:47.720
Level yeah, or maybe just more oats

20:47.720 --> 20:56.440
Oats cuz it's a horse you're thinking of a very horse based user experience. I'm more thinking about me

20:57.040 --> 21:02.520
You're right. Let me do this. Apparently we have unlimited money. Okay, how about unlimited horses?

21:04.080 --> 21:07.440
If I walk into this fucking tesseract

21:08.920 --> 21:11.800
This four-dimensional hyper stable

21:13.440 --> 21:15.440
And

21:15.440 --> 21:20.000
There's just infinite horses, but the horses are just infinitely long like in

21:20.960 --> 21:22.960
fucking interstellar

21:23.360 --> 21:29.160
Whoa, and I reached through the horse and I'm sending messages to my daughter

21:34.800 --> 21:41.300
Suddenly interstellar makes so much. I get it fucking Christopher Nolan sitting at home like finally

21:41.300 --> 21:45.900
Oh my dream stable. Thank you

21:46.980 --> 21:48.980
infinite horses, but

21:49.300 --> 21:51.140
What if they were in?

21:51.140 --> 21:52.780
what if it was a

21:52.780 --> 21:58.460
What if it was like a horse vending machine where you could just go and press a bunch of buttons and a horse?

21:59.100 --> 22:01.060
Come out

22:01.060 --> 22:03.580
You know what? Here's the thing. We're talking about

22:04.980 --> 22:10.300
Obscene amounts of the idea of a horse vending machine. You got over it so fucking quick

22:10.300 --> 22:12.300
Well, okay. Can I tell you why?

22:13.020 --> 22:16.200
Here's what bothered me most about the image you created. Okay

22:18.140 --> 22:20.140
Are they in little

22:20.180 --> 22:22.180
Plastic clear. It's not a gosh upon

22:22.980 --> 22:28.020
Okay, so it's more you see him behind the metal spirals. You see a big my horse is stuck

22:29.780 --> 22:31.780
I got two horses

22:32.620 --> 22:35.820
Well shit, I can't take care of two horses

22:35.820 --> 22:40.780
I'll just leave it in the tray than the next one. The good news is they both died

22:40.780 --> 22:43.060
Cuz this is a dumb idea if you think about it

22:43.060 --> 22:50.480
It'll be a very big machine and the fall would probably kill all the horse. It is an it is an interactive horse mass grave

22:52.500 --> 22:57.060
Alright hold on hold on hold on I got a whole lot of pre-dead horses here

22:57.060 --> 23:04.100
And you can kill anyone what dispensing solution 65 cents and their soul is yours. I

23:06.740 --> 23:11.780
Think we should make a movie theater for the horses and I hear what you're saying horses don't like movies and

23:12.140 --> 23:16.620
I get it I do but have you ever taken a horse to the movies? I bet you haven't

23:17.220 --> 23:23.580
I'm one a theater with seats that are comfortable for horses because none of them are I probably wouldn't

23:23.580 --> 23:28.340
Like movie theaters if they were built for people with half as many appendages as I have

23:28.620 --> 23:32.660
which is the what horses have to go through all the time because they have four legs and

23:33.220 --> 23:38.420
Also, I just think we should make a movie theater for horses. Well Justin I like that

23:38.420 --> 23:42.140
Can I in closing can I alley you as a good book report? Can I?

23:44.300 --> 23:46.700
What it you have unlimited resources, yes

23:47.140 --> 23:53.020
Movie theater for horses also movie studio that makes movies for horses for horses. Thank you Travis

23:53.020 --> 23:57.780
Okay, but directed by Christopher Nolan see this they would be like see biscuit secretary

23:57.780 --> 24:03.180
I can think of like a billion. No, no, no, no, no no no no those are about horses

24:03.180 --> 24:08.980
Yes, they're cool horse narrative for horses. Just like a carrot that swings for two hours

24:10.540 --> 24:15.300
But also by horses, so we're gonna need to think about cameras a little bit yeah

24:16.060 --> 24:18.380
Just really go back to the drawing

24:19.420 --> 24:21.420
software

24:21.420 --> 24:26.660
Before horses, we will need a big director's chair. Oh and how big are those Jodhpur is gonna be?

24:26.740 --> 24:33.060
Yeah, you just need to change the mouse so who can fit in it and they can take it from there

24:33.460 --> 24:39.060
The problem with horse movies is this uh-huh that it would be like the Christian movies

24:39.060 --> 24:43.620
They make sometimes where they trick you into it by putting a big-name Hollywood star in there like Jeff Fahey

24:43.620 --> 24:49.700
And then you think oh shit new Jeff Fahey movie. I'm stoked and then you get the end. It's like one man's

24:49.700 --> 24:52.060
Inspirational journey, you're like wait a minute

24:54.060 --> 24:57.500
Got me Jeff of dream stable is for real a new

24:58.300 --> 25:01.300
For horses by horses if we have unlimited money

25:01.300 --> 25:05.080
Could we just have a room in the dream stable that has infinite money inside of it?

25:06.140 --> 25:11.300
Shit, I hacked your whole question. I have infinite money now. I

25:11.980 --> 25:16.200
Wish Scrooge McDuck's been was like that. So when he dove in who just keep going

25:16.200 --> 25:18.200
Are you

25:18.680 --> 25:26.320
Entrapped like a grain silo. Yeah, exactly. Here I go. Be like, oh shit. I thought I wanted an infinite money

25:26.320 --> 25:28.040
But I guess I don't

25:28.040 --> 25:30.040
And then it's like Twilight Zone

25:31.280 --> 25:33.280
Can I just say Scrooge McDuck

25:33.760 --> 25:38.000
Ricky richest duck on earth, right? Yeah for sure. I can't think of a richer duck

25:40.040 --> 25:44.560
He has a lot of empty space in his money bin it was very

25:44.560 --> 25:46.560
Asterational

25:50.200 --> 25:56.560
Right, even though he's got the most money a duck could have he's still got about five six of that. Yeah

25:57.680 --> 26:02.040
Dive into it. He wants to be able to walk comfortably onto the surface of his mind

26:02.040 --> 26:07.320
Right. So at some point as he was designing the money been surely someone went that's big enough, right?

26:07.320 --> 26:14.360
Don't you think that's big enough? No, no, cuz he knows the more money he makes the less it hurts when he hits the money

26:14.920 --> 26:20.080
So he's like punishing himself. It's like why doesn't he just have dollar bills? Why does he have so many fucking coins?

26:20.160 --> 26:25.760
He's rich. Maybe that's it. It's all pennies. So it seems like a lot of money. It's like yeah, you're super rich

26:25.760 --> 26:28.040
He has like three hundred and ten dollars

26:28.040 --> 26:37.160
I should just dive in and land on a credit card. Is there a rich jag who has died

26:37.560 --> 26:44.440
IRL because they wanted this experience and they jump and they're like, oh fuck. It's hard metal. It's a bit

26:46.080 --> 26:49.840
That was the secret you need the bill to penetrate the surface of the coins

26:49.840 --> 26:54.560
I just started a new job and while there's generally been good. I'm having a problem with my boss

26:54.560 --> 26:58.480
I work for a streaming company that broadcast corporate meetings live to the web

26:58.480 --> 27:03.700
So there's no room for failure during an event. That's too bad because every online meeting fucking sucks

27:09.280 --> 27:16.920
Like clockwork before every event starts my boss approaches me takes off his headset looks me right in the eye and whispers

27:16.920 --> 27:19.920
Don't fuck this up

27:21.680 --> 27:27.240
Wait, wait, wait, wait, he pauses and then says even more quietly don't

27:29.560 --> 27:36.140
This makes me feel incredibly nervous and even though I'm fairly sure he's just joking around and I have never messed up

27:36.240 --> 27:38.240
He says it with a completely straight face

27:38.600 --> 27:44.440
Brothers, how do I get him to stop doing this? And that's from live stream lament. Listen, I don't

27:44.440 --> 27:45.880
He's

27:45.880 --> 27:53.040
He's a person who's in a position authority above you and if you mess up it would be embarrassing and then he says this every

27:53.040 --> 27:54.280
time

27:54.280 --> 27:59.040
Why do you think he's joking? Yeah, he says he has given you no social cues to indicate

27:59.040 --> 28:01.800
This is a 100% success rate tactic

28:01.800 --> 28:06.480
It sounds like if you're crushing it if you're running the world's only successful online business meeting

28:06.480 --> 28:11.320
Yeah, that's the other thing. It's like this tactic while it may seem a little heavy on the pressure

28:11.320 --> 28:18.240
It does seem to be working on you very well. Is it bad boss behavior to look at your employee and say

28:19.160 --> 28:23.660
I don't think you're supposed to I haven't been in an office since I worked at GameStop

28:25.200 --> 28:31.800
If you consider that an office, but I don't think you're supposed to wait, hold on I don't

28:31.800 --> 28:37.800
Nor do any of us, I think. In any sort of non-home business situation

28:39.400 --> 28:41.400
I don't think you're supposed to cuss. I

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
Don't think you're supposed to cuss. If my boss ever did a cuss toward me

28:48.800 --> 28:50.800
Isn't Justin your boss?

28:50.800 --> 28:58.620
I'm not and I haven't been for 18 months, but thank you for being my brother I guess. No, I mean as as older brother

28:58.620 --> 29:01.860
Oh, okay, like yeah within our hierarchy, I guess

29:02.560 --> 29:06.360
Oh as the CEO. I've never seen an org chart of our family

29:07.120 --> 29:12.080
I've never seen a chart of our family. I have never seen a chart of our family

29:12.080 --> 29:14.080
I've never seen an org chart of our family

29:14.080 --> 29:16.240
And I've never seen an org chart of our family

29:16.240 --> 29:23.760
Oh as the CEO. I've never seen an org chart of our family, but I guess. I think we all roll up to dad

29:23.760 --> 29:25.760
I guess. Yeah

29:26.560 --> 29:31.640
Gervin do you know the yahoo should we get in the audience? I just got really uncomfortable with the idea that dad was our boss in any

29:31.640 --> 29:34.480
Sort of in any sort of capacity. I

29:35.120 --> 29:38.840
Say we go to audience. I think we go to audience. I want to warn I

29:38.840 --> 29:46.080
I want to warn everybody. This is our fourth show of this tour in three days, which again is just astronomical amount of work in

29:47.120 --> 29:50.080
Two of the three shows we did before this one

29:50.080 --> 29:56.080
I had to leave the stage to use the bathroom because I drank a lot of liquids and it's feeling like there's gonna be one

29:56.080 --> 30:00.920
Of those shows so that's gonna happen again at some point just to warn you there's Paul. Hi Paul

30:00.920 --> 30:09.040
I'm putting my iPad away. Let's do it. Fuck it. I'm closing the computer. I'm

30:09.880 --> 30:11.200
new

30:11.200 --> 30:15.640
I'm just gonna keep don't stand up. I promise that's that's that ain't gonna do it

30:15.640 --> 30:18.360
Let's start on the right side and then we'll just sort of just go all over

30:18.360 --> 30:21.760
I see somebody that looks like with blonde hair sitting at the very end of the aisle

30:21.760 --> 30:27.560
Yeah pointing to your own top of your head. No, you're pointing the one with the blonde hair blonde hair pointing the top of your head

30:27.560 --> 30:31.960
You're standing up. Yes, you're standing up right now and you're going here. We go Mike's over here

30:32.920 --> 30:34.920
I'm sorry that we started so far away

30:35.800 --> 30:43.880
And we're scooting. We're scooting just scooting and scooting still scooting ever scooting and we're scooting and we are home

30:44.680 --> 30:50.440
Hi, what up? Hey, you can yeah, feel free everybody if you're at the mic just go ahead and angle it to yeah

30:50.440 --> 30:52.360
Shoot it right at you

30:52.360 --> 30:56.920
Everyone not to yell things at her. It's very it could be very strong. Hi. What's your name?

30:56.920 --> 31:02.560
My name is Jen. Hi Jen Jim or Jen Jen Jen. Okay

31:03.520 --> 31:05.520
Jen yeah, we got it. Yeah

31:06.080 --> 31:08.280
Just three letters, but we're gonna get there eventually

31:09.360 --> 31:14.840
What's your question? I have a theory and I have a really I would just love to hear your thoughts on this theory

31:14.840 --> 31:17.760
Okay, thank you for coming to our dissertation. Go on. I

31:18.200 --> 31:22.520
Know that some of you are college educated. Yeah, I've been to college. Okay

31:22.520 --> 31:29.320
Here he goes. You can't do callbacks to the last episode. We did at this theater two hours ago

31:30.440 --> 31:32.440
There we go. Nice

31:33.000 --> 31:40.240
So I have a theory that every raccoon is the ghost of a confederate Civil War. Oh

31:43.600 --> 31:45.800
Wait, hold on Jen do you

31:45.800 --> 31:53.740
Do you really do you really know it's serious. I believe this just because raccoons are a scoundrels

32:00.480 --> 32:06.360
Jen listen, you've come to the number one source for scientific discussion on the internet

32:06.680 --> 32:10.160
If that's the evidence you're bringing to your theory

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
You're gonna have to do better than that

32:13.000 --> 32:17.360
They bet you better have seen him eating some Johnny cakes or something. I don't know

32:17.360 --> 32:23.480
I mean, we are y'all are all tied up in the second part of the theory. I'm still I

32:23.880 --> 32:30.040
Don't even think I heard the second part of the theory because the first part of theory is I think every raccoon is a ghost

32:32.760 --> 32:38.400
But do you have evidence to support a ghost a ghost

32:38.400 --> 32:42.560
a ghost probably cannot take my trash, but if it could it would

32:45.960 --> 32:50.280
Every trash is another raccoons treasure. Yeah, but it's not a ghost! It doesn't mean it's a ghost!

32:50.280 --> 32:55.400
That doesn't mean the raccoons a ghost! You said a raccoon thing not a ghost thing.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.240
I agree raccoons love trash

32:59.400 --> 33:06.040
That is not up for debate. We're all agree that point is settled. I do not think that was part of the thesis statement

33:06.040 --> 33:11.560
Is there a line in a history book that's like and Confederate soldiers love trash eating trash

33:12.720 --> 33:14.720
those motherfuckers

33:14.840 --> 33:19.200
Okay, so I want to hear more from you actually more than anything. I want my entire life

33:19.760 --> 33:23.120
So please elaborate for the next 30 seconds. Go ahead

33:23.800 --> 33:25.720
souls ghosts

33:25.720 --> 33:31.160
Souls also live in raccoons. Okay, so it's a fluke situation where they reincarnated into

33:31.160 --> 33:37.480
Okay, so that's not the reason I understand what you're saying. I wicked don't but it's I

33:39.400 --> 33:42.880
Want to I want to I want you to workshop the theory a little bit more

33:42.880 --> 33:44.880
Yeah, I think it has I think it's got legs

33:45.720 --> 33:50.200
But the four of them four of them four furry little yeah ringed legs

33:50.200 --> 33:52.200
But what I need you to work on is

33:52.200 --> 34:01.520
Raccoons or ghosts start there solve that one and then you can connect me to the other dots. So thank you very much. Yeah. Thank you

34:04.400 --> 34:08.680
I'm sorry. Somebody brought a sign like this is WrestleMania. We have to do yeah

34:15.920 --> 34:21.280
Don't everybody bring signs though from now on we want everyone to be able to continue to see and our stadium

34:21.280 --> 34:27.840
We don't have stadium seating usually. Hi. Hi. Hello. What's your name? What was it? I talked during it. Yeah, shut up

34:28.400 --> 34:30.760
Okay, Stefan. Hey Stefan weird vibe

34:32.920 --> 34:36.000
Just to reiterate everyone we're gonna get weird

34:36.680 --> 34:39.560
Please we need you to be our anchor point Stefan

34:40.240 --> 34:43.280
Bring it down a little okay right here. Okay, what's up?

34:43.960 --> 34:49.240
Well, I was gonna ask about horse vending machines, but I think we covered that. Oh, okay. How serendipitous. Yeah

34:49.240 --> 34:51.240
so

34:51.960 --> 34:58.440
My friend and I have a podcast where we talk about fan theories and hypothetical questions about raccoons and ghosts

34:59.280 --> 35:01.280
It's not

35:01.960 --> 35:04.520
It's called overthinking out loud and you can find it wherever

35:10.680 --> 35:17.000
What is it what is your what is your question I wanted to know how to get free promotion for your podcast this isn't it

35:17.000 --> 35:18.480
I

35:18.480 --> 35:19.840
Sorry, go ahead

35:19.840 --> 35:27.040
If you guys had any fan theories that you would like to give a discuss about a subject about anything

35:27.040 --> 35:34.120
Oh, it's about anything. It's about anything Jesus for instance. So this one time I was doing a live show. Okay?

35:35.200 --> 35:38.440
Then this person got up and asked a question and my theory is

35:38.440 --> 35:45.240
They wanted to promote their podcast

35:50.080 --> 35:57.880
Don't be ridiculous the fun is not promoting his podcast. He's secretly recording us to include on a future episode

36:00.080 --> 36:01.680
I

36:01.680 --> 36:08.300
Literally, I'm blanking. I have nothing for you. We just told you about Scrooge McDuck and his $310. It's true. Yeah

36:08.920 --> 36:12.240
Can you it's a credit card. Could you just edit that in? I?

36:14.160 --> 36:19.840
Think the characters in Mary Poppins specifically Mary Poppins and Burt are actually a

36:21.320 --> 36:23.320
Sort of infinitely

36:24.120 --> 36:26.120
living alien beings

36:26.120 --> 36:31.960
That have wandered the earth as immortals and possessed powers beyond our own

36:32.440 --> 36:34.780
That they if you think about it

36:35.040 --> 36:39.520
It makes a lot of sense and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lay it out for your smart people

36:39.520 --> 36:41.520
You can walk yourself to it

36:41.600 --> 36:47.800
But I've watched that movie too many times, but that's what I think maybe just enough times maybe just enough times

36:47.800 --> 36:49.800
Thank you so far. Thank you so

36:49.800 --> 36:57.240
I trust the two of you to pick somebody good. Oh, no, this would be great

36:58.680 --> 37:01.560
You can't we're gonna pick somebody they're gonna ask their question

37:02.720 --> 37:05.720
Griffin has peed in every show we've done. This is ridiculous

37:05.720 --> 37:13.900
All right, hurry and ask your question before Griffin gets back and then he'll have to answer the question without any context, okay

37:15.000 --> 37:18.840
Ask quickly go go go. This should be a good one. My name is Charlotte. Hi, Charlotte

37:19.400 --> 37:21.600
And I also sent this in but I sent him yesterday

37:22.600 --> 37:28.680
Matt we all love the good your goof because your dad's grand lips. Yeah, but for me, it's a constant fear

37:29.400 --> 37:31.400
because

37:31.400 --> 37:36.040
Hold on one second. Charlotte. I need to put on my

37:36.680 --> 37:39.160
emergency live podcast panic vest

37:40.520 --> 37:44.360
In case we ramp into a fucking ravine like it feels

37:44.920 --> 37:47.480
Paralysed Lee close to doing right now. Hold on one second

37:48.280 --> 37:49.720
All right

37:49.720 --> 37:53.080
Go ahead Charlotte. My life is in your fucking hands

37:54.360 --> 37:59.400
Go ahead. I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it

37:59.400 --> 38:06.520
Go ahead. I'm trusting you. I'm not cutting you off Charlotte. I guess I should probably preface this. No kidding

38:10.300 --> 38:12.300
Also Charlotte

38:14.660 --> 38:16.680
You preface the things before this

38:16.680 --> 38:21.560
You post facing a post facing it. Okay. It's a cost to hear my mother

38:22.280 --> 38:26.040
and she flat out i'm a 25 year old married woman, and she

38:26.440 --> 38:28.440
Every time she sees me

38:28.780 --> 38:33.600
She kisses me square on the lips. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're back on track. All right

38:35.220 --> 38:39.140
Is your question how do I celebrate my parents loving me so much

38:40.620 --> 38:44.180
There's that but also it really skews me out

38:45.020 --> 38:48.780
So I really don't well, it's just right here. Yeah. No, I know where her mouth is

38:51.540 --> 38:57.260
It seriously skews me out so I'm wondering how do I ask her to just not stop

38:57.260 --> 38:59.260
kissing my mouth I

39:00.680 --> 39:06.000
Know we say that sometimes and we're talking like we're big confident not incredibly anxious people

39:06.840 --> 39:11.160
But this is one of those situations where you can be like, I'd rather the mouth kisses stop

39:11.800 --> 39:16.300
Yeah, gang does the thought cross your mind every time she kisses you right directly on your human mouth?

39:16.340 --> 39:19.300
Does the thought cross your head? I'm gonna talk to her about that someday

39:19.300 --> 39:22.380
Oh, yeah, this sucks

39:24.860 --> 39:26.980
Let me hit you with this idea cuz I get

39:27.780 --> 39:32.940
Conversations is bad conversations in general is bad. So what if you?

39:33.540 --> 39:39.540
Wean her off of this with like a little side juke a little left side dash a little wave dash left

39:40.840 --> 39:42.840
You're doing it like oh

39:43.400 --> 39:47.940
One of those that was presented in Joby 5.1 surround sound for our friends at home

39:47.940 --> 39:51.260
You've tried that and it did not work. Oh, no

39:51.260 --> 39:55.820
Oh my god, I would like to Charlotte someone was running up the aisle behind you for a hot second

39:55.820 --> 39:57.820
I thought it was your mom coming against it. I

39:58.420 --> 40:02.220
Was so excited. I was like so excited. I was flipping out

40:03.380 --> 40:07.300
They were completely in shadow. I just saw a silhouette but I was like, oh shit

40:07.940 --> 40:09.940
Here it goes

40:09.940 --> 40:19.260
But okay, so I've only been a parent for ten months now, I've been a parent for three years

40:22.460 --> 40:24.460
I'm gonna I also have a child

40:26.140 --> 40:30.540
I'm gonna make a bet. I don't think your mom likes doing it either

40:31.900 --> 40:35.780
Your mom is afraid that if she stops you'll think you she loves you less

40:35.780 --> 40:42.820
She's afraid that if she doesn't do it, you'll be upset. You'll be upset. She thinks you're into it. I know

40:43.500 --> 40:46.820
Every time she gives it she's like god damn. This is weird. It's so weird

40:48.460 --> 40:54.860
You could she just couldn't find an off-ramp, you know, like you get to a birthday and you're like, well this today's the day

40:54.860 --> 41:03.420
I'm gonna stop fucking Hagrid kicks in your door like you're 26. You don't have to kiss your mom anymore, Harry

41:08.180 --> 41:13.700
Talk to your mother talk to your mother. No one should kiss you on the mouth of that you really wanting them to that's a pretty

41:13.700 --> 41:20.740
Good general rule for life. It seems like this episode we did it. This is it. She's listening. Hi. Thanks for

41:21.260 --> 41:23.260
Thanks for listening. All right

41:23.260 --> 41:25.620
It out talk to your mom show you guys pick somebody as much

41:36.340 --> 41:38.860
Hey, what's up, this is Griffin, I'm gonna do these real fast

41:38.860 --> 41:43.820
So I'm pretty sick and I want to go back to bed, but I'm gonna give them the respect that they deserve

41:43.820 --> 41:48.340
Thanks for listening to our live show. We we did not want to put up three live shows in a row

41:48.340 --> 41:53.660
We really want to try to space these out. But Travis is moving and then my baby was sick

41:53.660 --> 41:55.660
and then I got the sickness and

41:55.700 --> 42:00.960
There's just been a series of unfortunate events. And so we had to put up another live show

42:01.560 --> 42:05.700
Which I'm I'm genuinely sorry about and hopefully we're gonna get things back on track soon

42:06.220 --> 42:10.580

42:11.260 --> 42:16.140

44:12.100 --> 44:15.600

Well, we tried to buy you a message on adventure zone the podcast you introduced us to that opened up our world to all things

44:30.540 --> 44:34.020
McElroy, but it's sold out in like zero seconds. Sorry about that

44:34.540 --> 44:39.160
We but we are sure the brothers will be fine with this TGIF style crossover

Thank you for being our DM and our sweet baby brother. We love you. We love you, too

44:43.620 --> 44:48.180
Sorry, you couldn't get on adventure zone. It's you know, it's a hot button commodity

44:48.180 --> 44:52.620
Well, we only do half as many of those as we do these so boom. Bam. You're good to go

44:52.620 --> 44:53.940
That's probably not true either

44:53.940 --> 44:57.180
But if you do want to get a message on the show just go to maximumfund.org slash Jumbotron

44:57.380 --> 45:00.280
Thank you everybody came out to this live show. It was a lot of fun

45:00.280 --> 45:05.060

45:14.020 --> 45:16.020
Thank you to

45:16.300 --> 45:18.300
justice and Dizzy Rascal

45:18.540 --> 45:24.680
for the remix from the video game DJ hero that we used as the intro to this episode because

45:24.780 --> 45:26.780
Justin like really wanted to get pumped up

45:27.340 --> 45:32.460
That was really why we did it and oh, there's a big sight gag coming up that we explained a little bit later on

45:32.460 --> 45:35.340
But I didn't want you to be lost where somebody asked a question

45:35.340 --> 45:39.020
Just as Justin is coming back on stage then he pivots on his heels and walks right back off stage

45:39.020 --> 45:40.140
And it was very funny

45:40.140 --> 45:45.500
And I didn't want you to be confused when there's like two minutes of uninterrupted laughter. That is what happens

45:45.500 --> 45:49.860
Um, I think that's it. I'm gonna go now. So thanks for listening and

45:50.420 --> 45:55.320
Go to maximumfund.org check out all the shows there. They're great and we'll be back next week. Bye

45:57.180 --> 46:00.500
There is a new series of Star Trek coming out and

46:00.500 --> 46:07.180
Maximum fun org has submitted to our blackmail and agreed to host a new show on the network

46:07.180 --> 46:10.060
We're calling it the greatest discovery. We've got

46:10.860 --> 46:18.080
Photographs we have recordings. We have web browser history on everyone at maximum fun

46:18.380 --> 46:23.380
Those are the things that have allowed us to have a second Star Trek show on maximum fun

46:23.500 --> 46:26.020
There's no way they're happy about this

46:26.020 --> 46:32.420
But we will be recapping every episode of Star Trek discovery all 15 of them as they come out over

46:32.900 --> 46:40.360
The fall and winter and we hope you'll join us by going to maximum fun org and looking for the greatest discovery

46:40.380 --> 46:43.140
We're looking for it wherever you download podcasts

46:44.740 --> 46:49.080
How about okay somebody with pink hair is pointing to somebody in front of them in the center

46:49.080 --> 46:54.820
Yes, you're standing up and waving with both hands. Yes. Yeah, and you put any signs. Yeah, right. No, this is good

46:54.820 --> 46:57.980
You have to be very specific because like literally every time the person's like well

46:57.980 --> 47:05.260
I am wearing a fuchsia jacket, and I'm wearing a jamiroquai top hat, but it may be somebody else with a fuchsia

47:05.260 --> 47:07.740
Hi, what's your name? Danny? Hi Danny

47:08.620 --> 47:11.660
so I need your guys's own advice advice on how to

47:12.940 --> 47:16.740
Convince my cousin that the patriarchy is real. Okay

47:16.740 --> 47:26.300
Hey, here's the thing he he believes in the gender binary, okay, but he doesn't believe in gravity

47:46.740 --> 47:48.740
You

47:53.900 --> 47:59.060
Know you probably don't write country songs, but you've got the start of a great one right there

48:00.140 --> 48:02.140
Danny sorry for the

48:03.180 --> 48:05.180
Just ran on stage and then ran back off

48:07.260 --> 48:09.260
Burrowed into the ground like a mole

48:09.260 --> 48:17.300
Oh Danny may I offer a suggestion a slight tweak on the wording of your question, okay?

48:17.300 --> 48:21.580
Yeah, hi brothers. I need advice on how to stop talking to my cousin

48:22.940 --> 48:24.940
That's valid. Thank you

48:25.620 --> 48:27.620
because at a certain point

48:28.260 --> 48:35.220
Convincing them is not the issue. Yeah is yeah is if you want proof like can you just tell them to like?

48:35.220 --> 48:40.940
Look at the replies to any woman's tweet on Twitter literally ever

48:43.340 --> 48:49.420
You need proof that the patriarchy says let me show you movies but gravity seems

48:52.000 --> 48:58.160
We could probably start the work, I mean that was like fuck yeah, let's defy gravity

48:58.160 --> 49:03.600
Yeah, how does he not believe in gravity he's a flat-earther too and

49:05.560 --> 49:11.200
You know what if you had put that sentence earlier it would have been surprising now, it's like oh, yeah, yeah

49:12.520 --> 49:18.640
How do you how do you believe in flat earth, but not gravity are we glued to the ground?

49:18.640 --> 49:26.760
Don't you have a finite number of minutes on this earth do not waste them on bad people anymore. This is my permission. Thank you

49:28.000 --> 49:32.040
Let them go. I know that's harsh. Yeah, that's harsh, but listen

49:33.120 --> 49:37.880
Family is given both given but also earned and this person's lost their privileges to you

49:38.480 --> 49:44.080
This is important. This person is not ignorant. They are willfully choosing. Yeah

49:44.080 --> 49:51.840
Yeah, do not believe in these two totally there things anybody who will look at you and go it is easier to convince them that

49:51.840 --> 49:53.840
The earth is flat

49:54.280 --> 49:56.280
But it's hard to convince them

49:56.720 --> 50:01.840
That gravity exists. Yeah, not because someone hasn't tried. Yeah

50:03.040 --> 50:06.840
Yeah, you're you're you're doing this person. Congratulations. So that's a big

50:06.840 --> 50:14.400
Mile all the time you free room for one more new person. That's great. Anybody in the market for a cousin today

50:15.400 --> 50:21.600
Let's see some hands who wants a cousin. Hey, I see a lot of cut a lot of potential cousins for you to choose from

50:22.560 --> 50:24.980
We're here on another episode of cousin swap

50:24.980 --> 50:34.060
The extreme cousin makeover, how was that? That was good. It felt brutal to me

50:36.540 --> 50:43.420
We just proved your family tree he thanks for coming he deserves it honestly. All right, thank you so much. Thank you

50:46.260 --> 50:52.600
Justin you're back back from the room. You want to pick somebody? Okay. There's somebody who's kind of dancing in the middle

50:52.600 --> 50:54.840
It's yeah, come on down

50:56.840 --> 51:02.280
You got to stop doing that every time hi, what's your name? Hi brothers. My name is Chelsea. Hi, Chelsea. I'm sure

51:02.720 --> 51:07.240
Thank you island time. I love it. So I'm a third grade teacher

51:08.800 --> 51:16.600
Thank you, thank you and one of my students the other day was like wow when you smile it's very creepy

51:16.600 --> 51:18.600
Oh

51:20.880 --> 51:26.120
Just quick note it amazes me that that kid said that and yet there are adults in this room like how do I have a

51:26.120 --> 51:28.120
direct conversation with someone

51:29.120 --> 51:34.040
Fucking putting it on blast every single day kids. Oh kids will say the shittiest things

51:35.000 --> 51:41.280
Well, that's why I love them. They're amazing. So my question is how do I convince him? I'm not creepy. Oh

51:41.280 --> 51:45.840
Oh good. Yeah, that's a conversation any adult can have it. No, no, I'm not creepy

51:46.920 --> 51:50.100
Yeah, you got to put a ton of effort into it. That's for sure

51:50.120 --> 51:55.020
Yeah, the harder you try to not be creepy the more effective it will be. That's what my experience

51:55.720 --> 51:57.720
Have you tried?

52:00.880 --> 52:02.880
Have you tried wait

52:02.880 --> 52:10.600
I think it's hunting. Hold on. There's some okay. It's been a long weekend. So something something fidget spinners, okay?

52:14.920 --> 52:20.720
But but you can't the problem is you can't walk up to them like free I don't know what sounds

52:22.480 --> 52:29.220
That is where miss Frizzle got her name, you know in the remake by the way, what's up, here's how fidget spinners work episode 1

52:29.220 --> 52:35.300
You got to like let the kid like you're they like walk in from recess and you're fidget spinning like oh, oops, sorry

52:36.660 --> 52:38.660
Yeah, it's important to not try

52:39.140 --> 52:41.140
They've got to catch you fidgets

52:42.300 --> 52:44.300
Hey, how cool is your school in vaping?

52:45.340 --> 52:49.940
So I need to get a vape. That's what you're saying. You don't already have a vape. What are you doing? It's 2017

52:50.540 --> 52:56.660
Or as the plane that the three holy shit. This is the funniest shit ever the plane. We're on today said

52:56.660 --> 53:01.140
There's no smoking on this plane. That includes e-cigarettes and personal vaporizers

53:03.340 --> 53:06.740
Excuse are you are you a flight attendant or a cop?

53:08.900 --> 53:10.900
No marijuana cigarettes

53:11.460 --> 53:16.100
To be fair personal vaporizer does sound like a space-age weapon. Yeah, sure

53:17.180 --> 53:23.780
Yeah, you should not have on the airplane to be fair. So yeah fidget spin, but make it look like an accident

53:23.780 --> 53:29.620
So yeah fidget spin, but make it look like an accident and don't smile while you're doing it. No. Yeah dead dead face

53:29.620 --> 53:33.940
Yeah, so fidgets been very seriously. Yeah. Yeah. I mean if you're not

53:34.540 --> 53:37.140
Everybody should be taking their spinning extremely serious like

53:37.700 --> 53:39.700
It's not a toy

53:40.620 --> 53:43.900
Does that help absolutely, thank you. Thank you. I

53:46.540 --> 53:50.380
Would like to propose an experiment, all right, all right, let's whatever it was an experiment everybody

53:50.380 --> 53:57.780
There's a gentleman. Yeah. Yes, you're sitting in the spotlight very excited so you can do your question, but

53:58.260 --> 54:00.260
You have a minute. Well, no

54:01.380 --> 54:06.700
This is a bad experiment. You have as much time as you want. Hi, what's your name? Hi. I'm Bailey Olmsted. Hi

54:06.700 --> 54:14.080
Hi, um, so Bailey, okay, like the alcohol got um, so I go to school here. I go to Emerson College

54:15.820 --> 54:18.220
Shit all right college fans

54:18.220 --> 54:19.780
and

54:19.780 --> 54:21.900
But I'm I'm from New York. I

54:24.540 --> 54:26.540
Like

54:27.860 --> 54:32.820
We're in Boston, I don't I didn't know this people in Boston don't like New York. Yeah, so that's

54:33.700 --> 54:37.500
Is it hi? Wait, is it hi? I'm I am a child. Please don't boo me

54:37.500 --> 54:42.060
Okay, so yeah, don't boo Bailey, but is it because of baseball cuz if so, come on gang

54:42.060 --> 54:49.460
This is a better place. We're at a comedy advice podcast show. We don't care about baseball here

54:50.500 --> 54:53.780
So this is and we like we like the reds

54:55.300 --> 55:00.820
My question like how do I how do I be a little bit proud of the fact that I'm from New York in a town that

55:00.820 --> 55:08.140
I love in Boston and and how do I make the two coexist that according to the audience are contradictory now Bailey

55:08.140 --> 55:15.380
Did you start to get a little disheartened about the chances you need a good answer to this when we just literally just discovered

55:15.380 --> 55:17.380
This is an issue 30 seconds ago

55:18.100 --> 55:21.700
No, I I was a little worried when you're like, what do you mean?

55:22.860 --> 55:24.860
Bailey I think

55:25.380 --> 55:27.380
That that is the definition of pride

55:27.860 --> 55:32.740
Because I think that if you are proud when everyone is okay with it

55:32.740 --> 55:38.180
That's easy, but to be proud while people are giving you a hard time is true pride. Oh

55:41.020 --> 55:47.960
That's beautiful I am I'm about to start crying in front of like 2,000 people, you know the thing Bailey

55:47.960 --> 55:53.560
And then this is everybody. I I love it when people are from places where like there's places like

55:54.380 --> 55:59.880
Morgantown and honey, so much, Virginia. You don't get along because they play each other in me. I shit you not friends of cold bowl

55:59.880 --> 56:01.880
And

56:01.960 --> 56:06.960
There's always and when you get people from Morgantown in the Huntington, there's always this like Huntington sucks thing

56:07.640 --> 56:11.340
Why can't you just be like, yes, I am from Morgantown and also here is nice, too

56:11.440 --> 56:15.340
They're both in West Virginia and they've both been ravaged by the destruction of the Kool-Aid

56:17.880 --> 56:21.720
Here in the Northeast you have a lot more that unites you and separates you

56:22.360 --> 56:27.240
So I think you should be proud of where you're from. It's got some pretty good things going for it

56:27.240 --> 56:29.920
Not as many as Boston because I'm physically a

56:33.240 --> 56:37.600
Long cold walk back to the hotel. I can't help you much there

56:39.320 --> 56:46.280
Can you take a thing that's good about New York and a thing that's good about Boston and combine them and as I'm saying this

56:46.360 --> 56:49.000
the only thing I'm thinking about no is

56:49.000 --> 56:55.360
Is pizza chowder?

56:57.360 --> 57:00.480
So all your friends were still like fucking up in arms about

57:02.440 --> 57:08.760
Inter-relevant baseball season where these two were in close contention here and just say like oh that's too bad

57:08.760 --> 57:13.040
You're still up in arms about that and you reach into a hearty spoonful of

57:13.760 --> 57:15.760
cream and pepperoni

57:15.760 --> 57:22.360
It would be something else pizza chowder is a fill-in metaphor for

57:22.920 --> 57:26.560
Squashing this completely ridiculous East Coast East Coast

57:30.920 --> 57:32.920
Thank you so much

57:36.640 --> 57:38.080
All right

57:38.080 --> 57:43.920
Let's do we've done the center law. Let's do back left somewhere. Somebody's waving a hat. I think on the on the far end

57:43.920 --> 57:46.880
Yeah, you've got your hat in the air and now you're standing up. No, they had the hat in the air

57:46.880 --> 57:48.880
Yeah, you're putting yourself with two hands. No

57:49.960 --> 57:51.960
Both of you point at yourself at the same time

57:53.440 --> 58:00.040
We're gonna be just stumble come down. Yeah, where's it go down to you? Yeah, we'll do that simultaneously. Yes. Okay. This will be fun

58:01.240 --> 58:04.480
All right, we'll do you first and then we'll do you next. Hi, what's your name? Tim?

58:06.760 --> 58:08.760
Canons kiss

58:08.760 --> 58:18.520
Thank you very much Tim did we help him? Okay. No, hold on. No, I'm no no Tim got what he needed. Come on down

58:20.800 --> 58:23.600
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this Reverend you look that up

58:26.280 --> 58:30.280
Kiss I like your red socks Josie a red socks. Yeah

58:32.440 --> 58:34.440
Hey Tim

58:34.440 --> 58:38.080
I'm looking at some I'm looking at a tape

58:39.240 --> 58:44.960
It's looking at a website. You may am I'm on a I'm gathering data points for you, too

58:46.560 --> 58:50.640
Top result are nuns allowed to kiss that is yahoo answers Timothy

58:53.840 --> 58:55.840
Don't be proud of that

58:57.160 --> 59:02.420
All right, Pastor Michael Kelly says not passionately on the lips, but certainly they can give a kiss on the cheek or a hug

59:02.420 --> 59:04.420
I

59:06.060 --> 59:10.260
I've sullied myself for you Tim. Hello new person. I'm gonna wait

59:10.260 --> 59:13.120
Hold on before you person who had long hair on the balcony standing up

59:13.120 --> 59:17.100
I've never done a balcony one before so start wait making your way down. Yeah, sure. We're gonna give it a shot

59:17.820 --> 59:19.300
Okay

59:19.300 --> 59:22.800
What's your name? My name is James James. Hello James. Hi

59:23.340 --> 59:29.300
So I am studying somebody stoked about James. Yes, so he yes, so he's got James fever

59:29.300 --> 59:32.740
um, so I'm studying for a PhD in physics and

59:33.380 --> 59:34.860
and

59:34.860 --> 59:37.140
That is not typically the reaction I get

59:40.740 --> 59:43.500
Hey hit you with a question. Yeah. Yeah is gravity real

59:51.100 --> 59:53.480
It's a theory but it's pretty well-defined so

59:53.480 --> 59:56.680
All right, not for sure, okay

59:57.840 --> 59:59.840
That's way more hedging than I expected

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:04.720
I thought we'd get one three letter. It's 100% for sure you guys

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.960
Yeah

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.080
So what's what's up?

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:18.560
So I was wondering how to introduce the fact that I study physics without having people grown or say that they hated their high school class

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:23.280
I might I suggest I'm getting my PhD in motion

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.520
Oh

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:31.080
Just step back a little bit. Just step back one little bit. We're gonna do both of you

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:35.100
Just okay right there right there right there. Why do they have to step James is not a bear. No

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.080
Careful careful. No, they were

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:44.920
Really want to focus on James cuz James studies physics. He's not gonna have a lot of opportunities for this level of attention

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:52.120
So I just want to make sure he gets this moment James next time somebody drops something or does something that

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.080
physics is in

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.180
To be fair that could be anytime somebody moves or

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.160
You could just be like, you know

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.640
the reason that happened was physics and then give them like a little just a little taste of

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.200
of something interesting like a bomb all that, you know, and then

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:23.960
They'll be like hooked. You know, I'm gonna be like I wish you knew more about this and you'll be like good news

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:31.360
This is he's better PR cuz I was thinking that there I can't think of a schoolhouse rock song about physics

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.960
She's like anytime anything happens

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:41.440
When heat or energy is transfer between two things is that physics which one is it?

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.980
See, I don't know cuz it wasn't a fucking schoolhouse rock song about it

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.320
Can you say you're getting a PhD in psychics

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.880
Which is what I think the word physics is half the time that I see it written on a page

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:58.480
It's super effective at the gym. It's good against fighting. That is James

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.440
James you're pandering to me specifically, but I appreciate it

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:08.760
Just say you're getting a PhD in Pokemon. Yeah deep into it. Yeah, I was at a second alone. Oh

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.920
Everybody stop listen for a second. What's physics?

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.940
like I know basically what it is, but like

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:20.360
95 fucking percent of you that just laughed you're only kind of sure what it is

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.520
super quick

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.080
Yeah, so if you want to look at the study of

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:34.800
You're gonna have to come more correct than that, let's try one more again James what's physics?

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:39.120
Make a schoolhouse rock sexy for now. I'm just saying but like what's physics?

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.760
So our whole universe was formed in a hot dance place and nearly

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.400
Thank you, thank you James

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:57.240
Fucking don't really on the left you first in person on the right. Hello

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:07.000
Okay, so this is also another locational question, okay, I go to college here but I'm from South Dakota

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.020
Okay, a lot of is there a South Dakota Boston beef that I don't know about

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.520
Okay, we're good here

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:20.000
And the thing is is that nobody's met someone from South Dakota. You're the first for me. Definitely. Oh, really?

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I've never heard that before

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:29.680
All across this great nation of ours except to South Dakota, is that the just between you and me

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.680
Sucks so bad

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.520
Is that the first question you get anytime anybody says I'm from South Dakota. Is it the Mount Rushmore one?

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.520
No, they say are there people?

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.880
Taking from somebody

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.960
So

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:50.080
I think this is a perfect grift opportunity

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:59.720
To convince them of something that exists in South Dakota. I have already convinced people that there are jackalopes, but like

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.680
What's another thing? I should tell people that happens in South

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:15.600
Do we have an episode like a hundred years ago about a great fog wall that separated the Dakotas where there's some sort of

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:20.600
You know nobody here in this audience of a thousand people remembers it. So it must have not been a great bit

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.880
What's a fictional thing to tell people yeah, it's where Dave Coulee is from

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.720
You're not gonna fucking challenge you know, we might know he's Canadian and if so you just stare at him until they leave

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:45.920
What if when you say you're from South Dakota and they're like, oh there are people there you say oh you're thinking of West Dakota

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.200
The state nobody mentions the star no one can remember

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:55.960
What can I ask you a question to help kind of frame this what

01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:02.720
Is a lot other than Mount Rushmore totally maybe this is a good opportunity for instead of you running a grift

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:06.600
You could educate our audience and the people who listen at home about right

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.160
Talk shit about West Virginia. I'm like home of soupy sales

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:16.440
Yeah, if you have any comments on like the infrastructure of South Dakota

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:22.800
Oh some people are fascinated when I complain about the coal industry taking over West Virginia. Yeah, that's why our education is so bad

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.320
Did you like did you like the voice of Chucky? That's Huntington West Virginia's own Brad Dourif

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:34.660
So Michael Cerveris you say all right, this is about it's South Dakota's time to shine

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.080
You're right girl, but West Virginia's had enough

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.840
There is the Mitchell Corn Palace

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:46.720
Is there wait, hold on. No, I don't want to hear what Travis has to say

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.640
I want to hear what you have to say about the Mitchell Corn Palace. We're on the edge of our seats

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.320
every

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.440
year

01:05:53.440 --> 01:06:00.080
Maze is gathered throughout the Dakotas. I guess there's not two of them. I don't think you need to pluralize

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.960
Because they make murals

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.200
Out of corn around the corn palace, which is actually just the jim

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:15.560
Edible? Travis has a great question. No, it's dried. I could still make that work for me

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:20.800
You want to say much Griffin loves corn corn art

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:28.120
Yeah, corn art. All right. That's I'm one step closer in my journey to knowing things about South Dakota

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.080
And I did not think corn art was gonna be the first step in this long journey

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:36.200
Mitchell Public Schools mascot is the colonels. I

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:43.760
I could respect that for sure, but not like a military colonel there like it's

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:53.160
Can I ask you so there's corn on the outside of Mitchell's Corn Palace, yes, what's on the inside it's a municipal gym

01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:02.120
Wait, Justin Schoke was very good. But your answer was also very good. So let's take turns Travis one more game again

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:07.320
There's corn on the outside of Mitchell's Corn Palace. Well, what's on the inside the cob?

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.680
All right now Travis

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.240
When I'm editing this I'm gonna pick whichever one was better

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:22.640
So there's corn on the outside of Mitchell's Corn Palace, but what's on the inside it's a municipal gym that's better

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.520
I say lots of dumb shit

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:33.800
Um, just start talking mad shit about Nebraska. You don't have to don't build up, South Dakota

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.320
tear down

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.720
Tear down North Dakota

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:45.440
You all got a team up gotta unify to Super Dakota

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.760
the ultimate Dakota Oh

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.320
Dakota fanning watch the throne

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:59.360
Two states have combined and they finally take down Dakota fanning

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.080
Does that help

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.280
Now you in the aisle

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:16.820
Wait, what are you doing? Oh, no, we're right now. We're taking a selfie. I'm 35 years old. I don't understand and also 30 also

01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:18.820
I'm 36

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:23.300
Oh, there's a lie. You don't understand. Hi. What's your name? Hey, I'm Chloe

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:29.860
So I work as an art conservator which it's like an art doctor

01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:35.180
Like if it's old and broke and in a museum, my job is to make it not that okay, not in a museum you steal it

01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:39.900
You craft you cracked my art puzzle

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:47.360
So like wait, can you I this is this is the fucking like episode where I just want to know everything about the question

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:56.100
Restoration is I do I specialize in papers like old books and miss paper. What are you fucking?

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.420
What do you do? It like it's moldy and shit. I don't know

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.140
You need to know you should know it's your fight

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:09.500
Oh of expertise is not on us. Okay. Listen, I mean like it gets it gets ripped

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:15.100
If it gets wet you get those nasty say that I have eight. No, we hate tape don't take anything anyone ever

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:21.540
I have okay. Wait a minute for you. No, I just can I start I what's the like weirdest thing that you used to fix books?

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.100
Oh

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.620
Well, one of the weirdest things paintings conservators use is saliva

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:34.060
We're done go on okay go on with your question. I'm so sorry. I asked about your trade. No, no

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.340
No, I need to know they look like spit on it

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:39.300
No, they get a cotton swab sort of like for your ears

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.540
But longer and bigger and you put in your mouth and use it to clean a painting

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.600
Some it's not just cuz they forgot to bring anything else with them

01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:51.620
Or is it because they are fucking like narcissist pervs like now I'm part of the Mona Lisa

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:59.220
They fucking take their friends and you see them like you see that one starry starry night, it's my spit on it

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:03.860
That's definitely the reason

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:10.140
Hey for a second go about two minutes ago. You talk some bad shit about tape. Is that a thing for you guys?

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:15.340
Is that like y'all really really angry at me? I cannot tell you how many paper conservators

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:20.220
I know that have mad beef about today. So let me let I love this fucking world of ours

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:23.940
I know it's a very good world. So let's be clear tape

01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:31.220
Mean that's about the long and short of it, you know

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:37.820
Can I ask you a bunch of questions about the realness of the movie national treasure and some okay? Okay

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:40.260
Okay, like like for real though last summer

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:44.420
I did intern in the labs of the National Archives where that shit was shot

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:51.160
And there's a part where like Nick cage like burps onto the Declaration of Independence and a treasure map appears. Is that

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:55.880
How often do you find treasure maps? How often do you like burp on do it?

01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:01.820
Like a piece of paper that's a treasure map as a map. I would say like once a week. So like I knew it

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:04.780
I know y'all want to get to your questions. I want to know everything about

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:09.460
Fucking fascinating everybody. Okay. Okay. What's your question? Sorry?

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:12.060
So I fix old art and shit. We got that

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:17.180
Yeah, but there's this one tool that we use when we want to make a nice sharp crease

01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:21.100
Not an old stuff for like making boxes or whatever. It is called a bone folder, right?

01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:27.940
Wait, oh wait, it gets better. So how that's the best word

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:31.620
So it's made sometimes out of animal bones. Sometimes

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:34.660
But

01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:41.020
Fucking the heebie-jeebies up here. It's September. I'm not supposed to get these Halloween spooks already. Go on. Yeah, they are all haunted

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:44.100
It's terrible. Okay, but haunted by a deer is like no

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:48.940
We don't use my paper. Please. No, please please letter

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:56.920
So common parlance in the paper conservation world is when someone tells you to use your bone folder to fold something

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.920
They'll tell you to bone down hard

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:08.340
Yeah

01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:15.380
With gratitude to the last episode of my brother my brother and me because I've recently realized my life's calling

01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:19.900
Teach me your ways

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:25.880
It just goes to show what I've always said, which is paper conservators know how to fucking party

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:30.300
So I don't make it your

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:37.020
God to the fucking question yet. If your question is how cool is my life the answer is very well

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:39.340
Yes, it is and I do not want people to stop doing this

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:44.180
I love it. My problem is when this happens at work and someone says oh you're gonna really have to bone on hard on that

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.180
one I

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:49.540
Know what Justin's doing right now. Yeah, I do that

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:54.140
And then I think it doesn't like they've just been seeing it for so long that it doesn't connect that it's like very dirty

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:58.740
And funny and great. So I think they think I'm like, I'm not gonna do that. That's a shitty idea

01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:05.380
How do I not make my co-workers think I'm shitting all over their ideas when I laugh at this funny shit that they say how long?

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:10.460
Quick brother pull how long in your life? Would you have to casually use the phrase?

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.620
100,000 years. I

01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:22.180
Don't know how long an eon is but many of them right cuz I'm pretty sure I could be a hundred and two and saying

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:29.500
I've been born with a bone folder in my hand fucking

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:35.360
170 years old is going town to town folding bones fucking

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:43.920
There's this is this is the this is the Kobayashi Maru it's gonna be funny forever

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:50.560
Forever it's not gonna not there's no words that we could say up here that will not make bone down, huh?

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:57.400
Especially when someone says to you you're gonna have to bone down hard

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.420
I guess the only thing is you just need to start responding. Don't I know it?

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:12.200
Thank you, thanks, yeah, I think that I'll really solve my problem

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:17.080
I don't think we solved it, but just thank you for this gift you yeah

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
All of us here tonight. I

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:23.160
Sense you up there. I knew I knew

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.620
Let's do like one more maybe yeah

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:34.040
Let's see, let's see we need to pick one quick. There's a I think the last like three apparently

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:41.320
How about okay? You're pointing to somebody there. You've got your hand. Yeah stand on up, and you're walking towards us here

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.320
We go yeah all the way over there

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:47.400
We're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing hey by the way good

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:54.720
Luck following that one because holy shit. Do you work in an industry with like a really funny named tool?

01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.000
I'm sorry just real quick something just occurred to me

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:05.680
There has to be someone who makes bone folder. Yeah, okay? We can't we got to be done with bone folders

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.160
We have to hi. What's your name? Hi? I'm Cory. Hi Cory

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:14.640
All right, so my old roommate when he would take a shower, okay instead of using a towel. He's a folder

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:21.000
Can you work so I can you just like I want to hear you, and I want to work with you

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:26.540
I'm gonna play in this space with you Cory, but you're gonna have that bone down hard

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:32.400
You're gonna have to work like bone folder or something to just like keep this I'm riding a wave right now

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:37.720
If it right now you're my co-pilot, and I have used a bone folder. Have you really I have

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:56.800
This is a good planet this but maybe you're the only two people who've used a bone fold up wait on

01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.840
Show of hand listen I can't stress enough

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:08.440
I need sincere serious answers don't raise your hand if it's a lie raise your hand if you have ever used a bone folder

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.240
That's a shit ton of hands

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:18.680
Did you bring one

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.420
Okay, sorry, okay, sorry sorry Cory

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:27.160
I'm whatever you have to say is gonna be really important, and we're so paying attention to it

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:33.320
I'm definitely not thinking about how quickly we could go backstage an Amazon fucking one-day delivery some bone folders

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:38.600
We're definitely not gonna be thinking about whether or not we can get bone folders delivered to our hotel tonight before we have to fly home

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:44.880
And we're there seamless for bone folder definitely no definitely not thinking about if you can bring a bone folder on an airplane

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:50.340
What's what's your roommate used to shower tell that sounds tell me more after he would shower

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:53.300
Instead of using a towel he would use toilet paper

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:06.140
One time he even went all the way into the kitchen and then used paper towels and like I know he has a towel

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:13.260
I've seen it, but he's never used it so my question is is he an alien trying to steal my organs or like

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.020
like

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:19.580
That's really very wasteful

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:28.140
Extremely wasteful the towels right there, but then you have to wash the towel you don't gotta wash no toilet paper

01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:34.180
He just left the toilet paper out like damp. How many rolls so is your roommate right?

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:36.940
Yeah, old roommate he used one and a half rolls a day

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:39.740
Never never once bought any

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:44.600
Send us a question before cuz we definitely need to address TP sort of like

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.600
ridesharing

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:53.680
What's interesting we get a lot of questions where the question revolves around like this person does something weird and

01:17:54.760 --> 01:18:00.360
So very rarely does anyone entertain the idea of are they doing it on purpose to fuck with me?

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:08.160
And my guess is one time first time your roommate forgot to bring their towel in the bathroom

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.880
And just right off a toilet paper, and it freaked you out so bad

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:18.140
That they just can't do hey hold up. Hey hold up. How you know they did this okay?

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:28.200
Paper he would leave it hanging like on the shower shut up. No

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.800
With the paper towels he didn't know that I was home, and I was sitting in the front room

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.800
And I see him walk into the kitchen and just like

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:40.880
Oh, was it at least like Downey like fucking triple ply

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:47.340
Shit did your roommate ever display any like germ a phobic

01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:51.120
I don't think I thought you were gonna say serial killer tendencies

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:55.000
Cuz the answer is based on what I know of them. Yes

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:05.040
Yes, you know in England. They don't really use paper towels, and they probably think it's pretty weird that we do so maybe

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.840
Because he came to America, and he was like these things fucking rule

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:18.840
Hey, let's just for everything. Let's maybe get too real here for a second. Why did why did y'all stop living together?

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.440
Because if it's not for this

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:27.240
Did what worse like um well he also left food out, and then we got a bunch of mice

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.620
That's bad. I like the way you said that though because it makes it sound like you went and bought a bunch of mice

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.680
He left food out period

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:41.000
And we got a bunch of my face. That's bad, but I've heard that one before

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:44.060
This other things new to me and exciting

01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:51.940
Um so what's the question yeah, so is he an alien? Yes? Yes? Yes, yes, yes, yes

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:57.780
With my life. Yes, okay move on Cory. Congratulations. You had a et experience

01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:03.940
Come on

01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:10.060
Um oh god way in the back waving the tube way in the back wait. Yeah. Yeah, you're pointing to them

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:14.700
Yeah, and then they're coming down the aisle right now. Yeah, come on down

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:22.820
All right, and anyone who didn't get picked you're probably think about it later. Yes. I don't love you as much as

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:31.380
That's not true. I love you all so much. Hi. What's your name? Hi? Hi Emily. I love your shirt. Thank you

01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:37.780
Love yours um thanks got a nice. I'm glad we built this report

01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:39.460
Mm-hmm

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.460
Tell us some other stuff you like about us

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:45.660
Please don't it said when she bought her shirt. I made it 80 cents

01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:53.620
Maybe she made your shirt. Did you make this shirt? Thank you so much good design?

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:57.700
So I got it

01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:01.740
I'm a female security guard at a truck gate. I am basically the only

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:08.520
Female there, and I have to deal with a lot of truckers, and so what's a truck gate like a weighing facility like it?

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:12.040
It's where like can you get a little sorry can you local something?

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:15.320
It's um where vendors will bring the food for supermarkets

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:20.400
And a lot of these truckers don't talk to women normally

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:23.920
but I'll check them in and out and like I write down their purchase order numbers and

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:27.160
They all think that I'm super like

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:31.240
Enchanted by them because they don't see a lot of women

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:39.540
Wait hold on they exist on earth though, right? What's up? They don't cease to exist when they leave your truck gate, right?

01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:41.540
They see women other places

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.280
They don't act like they do

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.600
So they see you and they go

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:55.800
Oh like sometimes like if it's raining them like oh, man. It's your shirt in rain like oh, but

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.880
Either way some of them are really gross some

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:07.400
So no, it's it's very upsetting um you know it sounds like it

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:10.560
I'm saying it with this tone because if I said it with the tone

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:15.640
I feel that would be a down into the podcast. I'm saying it up here

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:19.600
I lied about having a husband once I went on my husband like that and the guy like leaned over went

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.600
Oh, I don't even care

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:30.520
That is not my question my question Jesus Christ a real God who has saved me from that being a real question

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:35.660
They all tend to call me things like sweetheart hon, babe

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.800
And it's yeah, it's real gross um

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:45.280
um, but I recently started responding with like no problem sport no problem champ and

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:53.680
Wait hold on is your question. How awesome am I doing? Yeah, the answer is very awesome

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.340
Can we hey can we come to you for advice? Yeah?

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:06.960
My question is what else can I use because I feel like I need it happens so often

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:10.000
I feel like I need more than just champ and sport okay, okay?

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:14.920
You have to understand that we would never have thought of something as good as the thing you've already thought out

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:18.320
You could keep going like slugger kiddo tiger

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.080
Dill weed

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.080
shit fucker fuck you

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:28.000
Boner bone you put no boner wouldn't work

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.700
I feel like that would cause bone folders

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:39.420
What don't worry can I can I try no problem dad

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:45.960
Just see just fucking see where it go wait wait that might maybe pop off pop off

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.960
I

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.400
Don't want to go down that avenue so bad

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:58.600
What if can I ask you a question you run the secure security guard at the gate?

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:03.020
Can you just if they're like yeah, thanks a lot, sweetie. You're just like oh click

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:11.480
I'm outside. I'm outside with them. Do you have a gun no Jesus Travis?

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:17.960
Don't be ridiculous. Do you have a taser? I don't I have a big flashlight. That's very hit him. Yeah

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.320
No, you don't have to hit all of them

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.480
But if you hit one word gets around Chuckers love to talk

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:28.960
You know I called her sweet. She's not very sweet. She's not very sweet. I was wrong. I caught her pumpkin

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.080
She is no pumpkin. I have she's a human being with big flashlight. I

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:38.820
Thought she was a baby angel. It turned out. She's actually a human being with a very large flashlight

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.480
Never gonna believe this

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:47.640
Do you remember do you remember that sugar dumpling I thought she was a sugar

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:50.360
It turns out she's a person and she's very strong

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.160
She has a flashlight she knows how to use it yeah, she's yeah, please get the word out to other truckers

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:03.600
And you know what listen this is how wild other truckers, but if this

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:08.720
If this sugar baby angel could turn out to be an actual living human being

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:16.720
Well, we can't really run the risk that others could be too. What if they all have flashlights?

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:23.720
What if all women have flashlights? What do we do there? What do we do there? We can't run that risk

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:30.400
May we just play it say cool. Yes, let's say for me cool. That's the big horn

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:36.000
They have so anyway. I guess our answer is flashlight one of them, and I'm sorry for any repercussions

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
