00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:28.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:48.000 --> 00:58.000
What's up, you cool baby?

01:18.000 --> 01:28.000
What's up, you cool baby?

01:28.000 --> 01:38.000
What's up, you cool baby?

01:38.000 --> 01:47.000
What's up, you cool baby?

01:47.000 --> 01:57.000
What's up, you cool baby?

01:57.000 --> 02:07.000
What's up, you cool baby?

02:07.000 --> 02:17.000
I'm familiar, but not too not familiar. It's a new craze.

02:37.000 --> 02:47.000
I'm familiar, but not too not familiar. It's a new craze.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
One more time for our friend, Len, if you don't mind.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Keep an eye on that guy.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Yeah, he's going places.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
Hey, by the way, Len, you're so welcome for your big break.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
So glad we could provide that.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
He left.

03:23.000 --> 03:31.000
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

03:31.000 --> 03:41.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

03:48.000 --> 03:56.000
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
I just want to start things off. I want to say thank you to Paul, who gave us this terrible ticking clock.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
To our deaths.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
That's right in front of me.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Like the Chilean miners who emerged so many years ago.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
We've returned here.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
How long before that reference just becomes self referential instead of actually referential?

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
When people say like the Chilean miners and you're like, you mean the My Brother, My Brother and Me guys?

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
Well, listen, I have spent my entire life wondering what 300,000 horny people.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
There's 300,000 people?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Holy shit.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
3,000 horny people.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Hey, y'all sound like 300,000 people.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Brooklyn, best fans in the world.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Best fans in the world.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Riches and shit.

04:48.000 --> 04:56.000
Every time I come to Brooklyn, I say it always sounds like there's one person is 300.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I did the math bad. Never mind.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
You did so bad.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
We got to stop pre-drinking. I say it every time.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
And during drinking and post drinking. We're old.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Yeah.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
I mean, we had some fun there, but there's a fucking lot of people.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
Here's the nice thing though. Statistically, some of you will enjoy the show.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Yeah.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
The more people are here, the better chance we have that someone walks out going, you know, that was pretty good.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Yeah. We got to touch on like every fetish we can think of.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
They're walking in like, you know, I didn't enjoy most of it.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
The foot stuff though.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Chef's kiss.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
That one part where they're talking about the stuff on the butt.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Love it.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
So we've been, we found the butt fan.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
So we've been together now for a couple of days.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
And this is a horrible transition from talking about the butt fan.

05:58.000 --> 06:07.000
But I, we're all, you know, hot young dads, hot young daddies.

06:07.000 --> 06:14.000
I love, I love being around you all in your element because I get to see like how y'all are dadding out.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
And I was wondering if we could start the show out of Travis.

06:16.000 --> 06:32.000
You could tell me about the little anecdote that you shared with me shortly a few moments ago about your,

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
your father of the year sort of moment.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
He's about to say a sentence and I'm so excited for it.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
Are you like me that you've been spending the last 30 seconds envisioning exactly how he's going to phrase it?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
It's like cellar door.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
It's like the most phonetically pleasing sentence imaginable.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
He's going to say it and I'm excited because the crowd's going to just explode.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I should preface this.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
If you know, listen, you have to say this.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
There's nine words Travis that you have to say.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I dropped a fidget spinner on my baby's head.

07:08.000 --> 07:21.000
There it is.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Went down real good.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
I know.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Let me preface this.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
I have impulse control problems.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
So my baby was taking a nap.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Yeah, it gets better, right?

07:35.000 --> 07:49.000
I looked at my wife and said, wouldn't it be funny if I spun this so that it spun upon her forehead?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
How long have you been in the fidget spinning game?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Cause that's a pro level maneuver.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Apparently not long.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
And let me be clear at that moment, my brain unchecked went, yeah.

08:00.000 --> 08:16.000
And so spun it and I kind of jokingly waved it over my daughter's head at which point it spun off my fingers and bombed my sleeping daughter in the face.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
And she woke up and I shushed her back to sleep saying forget.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
I'll never recover from this.

08:26.000 --> 08:35.000
It's a pretty sad comment on the state of affairs, though, that when Travis told us this anecdote, my and Griffin first reaction was, well, there's the intro.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
So his loss is our gain.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Listen, I wish I could say I'm just doing my best, but I'm clearly not.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
That wasn't, no.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
And I also should be clear, and this is, I can't, I can't stress this enough.

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
I did not buy this fidget spinner.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
It's really important to me that you all know that.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
I feel like most fidget spinners should say on, have printed on them.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
I didn't buy this.

09:07.000 --> 09:14.000
It was in a bag that was given to me at an event and I said, well, this is my end.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Finally, the fidget spinner lifestyle I've been looking for.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Better drop this on my kids.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Real quick question.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Anybody in here have a fidget spinner with them right now?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Wait, please, just a show of hands.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I'm just trying to get an idea.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Are they still happening?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Get the spinners up in the air.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I'm curious if the spinners are still hot.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Oh, God, I feel a breeze coming from the audience.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
It's so nice.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
So if you've never listened, anybody never listened to our show before?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Okay.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Okay, how weird was that song about shrimp?

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
We take your questions and turn them alchemy like into wisdom.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
We're very smart and good at things and this is how we help.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I dropped the fidget spinner.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
There's some things we're okay at.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I should actually just leave the stage now.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
You did detract from your bona fides.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Let's get in it.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
What is the etiquette for telling someone that they were in your dream last night?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Is it ever acceptable?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Is it ever not awkward?

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
What if it was a particularly rad dream where you fought zombies together?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Does that make it okay?

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
It's from Dreaming Duo in Ohio and New York.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Are you here?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
All right.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
Can I just say, at live shows, whenever I ask that question, are you here?

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
There's always this weird like half a beat where I think, they're not here.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
And then someone says, woo.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
And I think, they're lying.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
Like they waited to see if someone else responded first.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Yeah, they're playing an extended game of werewolf.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Like, oh, I'm here.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Yeah, I've been here the whole time.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
For sure.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I was the here one that was here.

10:49.000 --> 10:58.000
There is no way you can tell me in a sentence, I had this dream about you last night where we were fighting zombies,

10:58.000 --> 11:04.000
where I'm not going to be looking for the gap in that sentence where you edit it out and then we did it in the dream.

11:04.000 --> 11:11.000
The problem really comes from like every time you say to someone, you were in my dream last night,

11:11.000 --> 11:18.000
they immediately become 13 years old and they like start 13 year old giggling like, was I any good?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
And it's like, that's the problem.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
That's the problem.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Let's just break that down.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
That's the equivalent of saying, hey, I thought about you yesterday.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
I'm like, about boning me?

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
I may be alone in this.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
I don't think I am.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I'm pretty sure everybody else is in the same boat.

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
But whenever I hear someone start a vignette with, so I had this dream last night, my immediate reaction is, oh, good.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
I had some other stuff I had to think about.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Let me go ahead and fire that up real quick.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
To be fair, you can pretty much respond to any dream sentence with, really?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Wow.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Great.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
How many clouds?

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
I feel the same way about, I have this idea for a movie and I'm like, ah, great.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
What was it that I had to get at Costco today?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
That explains so much.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Yeah.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
Both of those were subtly targeted at Travis.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
He's got a lot of pitches.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Some of them are good.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And you'll never know.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Because I don't pay attention to them.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
How about a Yahoo?

12:20.000 --> 12:29.000
Can I just say, I now have this ticking down letting me know how long we've spent on some bits and it's like, that was a two minute bit.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Oh, no.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Thank you.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Save me from myself.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
You're welcome.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
It'll be my burden.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
This one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Morgan Davey, are you here?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Nope.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I don't know where anyone lives.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
Yahoo Answers, anonymous Yahoo Answers user, going to call him Kevin, asks, some Kevins

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
in the crowd tonight.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
What's up, my Kevins?

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
Oh, I'm feeling these Kevins.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Okay.

13:01.000 --> 13:14.000
Kevin asks, can I eat a meatball sub while sick?

13:14.000 --> 13:25.000
I have a stuffy nose, a sore throat, and I threw up around midnight, but I feel better today.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Can I eat it?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
The next two sentences are so good.

13:30.000 --> 13:37.000
I want it so bad.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
My dad made them, by the way.

13:38.000 --> 13:45.000
It's not from Subway or anything.

13:45.000 --> 13:53.000
Okay, I will say, to Kevin's defense, the traditional Kevin defense, every time I am

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
sick, there's something in my brain that goes, you know what you want?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
And it's like the word, like you want a hamburger, right?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
And I was like, I don't.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
I can't.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
That's all I crave.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Like my body's like, let's really flush this out.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
The way you think about eating when you are sick is so whack, because it's like, oh, I've

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
got a cold.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
That means I can only eat dry Cheerios.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
And it's like, probably not.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
I want dry waffles.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
That's all I ever want, just toast up some waffles.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
I think that's a nature versus nurture thing, where like if you're 10 and your parents are

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
like, oh, you're sick.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Here's some toast and Sprite.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
You're like, that's sick food.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Cool.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
All right, here we go.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
I want to talk about-

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Flat Sprite is the thing we didn't like.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
What don't you love?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I would lose my fucking gourd.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
If I went into a restaurant, I saw someone eating toast and flat Sprite.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
What if you went to a doctor and the doctor's like, I see.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Let me prescribe.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
This is going to sound a little weird.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Hang with me.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
A meatball sub.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
It's got all the vitamins you need.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Homemade meatball sub.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Homemade.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Don't go to Subway.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Don't go to Subway or some shit.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Fuck quiznos.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
I'm a doctor.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
I do have to say, this is some not great dading.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
Yeah, I was about to say, I've only been a dad nine months.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Henry right now has an ear infection.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
My initial instinct was not, oh, that's too bad.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
I'm going to make some meatball Subway sandwiches.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
Meatball sub is a meal to take some prep.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
You got to go buy that shit.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
You don't just have meatball sub fixings.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
I've never thought, oh, my sweet boy is ill.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
I'm going to make a crockpot based meal.

15:23.000 --> 15:35.000
Instead, I just leave town for five days.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
I want to apologize because earlier Travis made it sound like Kevin's dad was never prepared

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
for things.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
And it may be that Kevin's dad shops ahead of time or maybe every Tuesday is meatball

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
sub Tuesday.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
And he just hasn't read it.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Meatball sub Tuesday waits for no man.

15:52.000 --> 15:59.000
Kevin, can you imagine if it's Monday and you start feeling bad and you're like, fuck.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Just snorting lines of emergency like I can't.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
It's tomorrow.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Not today, Jesus.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
Kevin's dad is sitting bedside like, you're missing out.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Too bad.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
I can't break the chain.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
More for me.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
I'm going to eat yours.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Save it for tomorrow.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I wish I could, Kevin.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
But tomorrow will be Wednesday.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Sadly, Wednesday is dry cereal and flat Sprite.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
He missed it by that much.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Griffin, I didn't want you to miss out on your lifelong dream.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Okay, I wanted to do something really quick.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
Hold on.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
It's working.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah, Wonderwall.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
All right, everyone, get ready to sing Wonderwall.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Absolute silence.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
He's not starting until it's quiet.

16:52.000 --> 17:04.000
Make sure you get your phones out and get this on the tube quick.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Shit.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Start over.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Start again.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Sounds like hot, hot, hot.

17:12.000 --> 17:20.000
They fucking stole that melody.

17:20.000 --> 17:34.000
This is a long song.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
It's an original composition.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Can I say my favorite thing about that?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Called Theme from Rugrats.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
He held his hand like a creature where this was the head.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
I was very scared.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
And it was like.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
So different.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Oh, there's different voices.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
This one's called Sneaky.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
That was from Rugrats Knights.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
Where it got a little racy.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
I gotta say, I haven't talked much in the last two minutes.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
And I'd really like to work Griffin piano segments into every show.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
It would only be the Rugrats theme song.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Hey, everybody.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Thanks for coming out tonight.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
I'm going to play a little tune you may have heard.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
Can someone reach out to Klaski Supo to see if we can use that?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Oh, no.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
This might never make it to air for legal reasons.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Ask Mark Mothersbaugh.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
I've killed the momentum of the live show.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I love socks.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I have almost 50.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
The end.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
No, not in.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
I love socks.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
What do I do?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
I have almost 50 pairs.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
And I'm even subscribed to a monthly sock delivery service.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Oh, nice.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
My friend, you should stop.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Do they sponsor us?

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
I'm assuming they would use the brand name.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Unfortunately, I usually wear long pants in the colder seasons.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
And no one can see my great foot mittens.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
I don't care for that.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I don't care for that.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
That's not happening in case anybody's curious whether or not that's happening.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Foot mittens is not happening.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
How can I show off my neat socks while still looking cool?

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
That's from Super Sock Supporter in Central Jersey.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Are you here?

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
Can I get verbal confirmation via Woo that sock mittens is not happening?

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
You're going to let it go.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
No, it's happening.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Okay, apparently it's happening.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Sorry.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
They're sticking with it.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Socks on the outside.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Okay.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Of the pants?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Of the shoe.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
You just jump right to it.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
It's not, okay, it's not the socks you're wearing.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
It's the socks you're displaying.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Okay, so you have two pairs of socks on, one protecting your foot.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
It is a one-off sock experience.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Okay.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
It is a bespoke sock experience.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Is sandals an option?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
No.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
No.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
I just wanted to pitch that hypothetical.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
The problem with cool socks is that they're only cool if they are discovered like an ancient

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
treasure.

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
You have to react to it like, oh, oh, yeah, I forgot I was wearing my hilarious T-bone

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
socks.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
You can't be like, yes.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
If someone's like, oh, are those puppy dogs on your socks?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Yes.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
Well, you shouldn't really respond to anything like that, Travis.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I'm not sure that observation is specific.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Unless the question is, are you the murderer?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Yeah, right.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Did you bring the silver dagger?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Yes.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Yes.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
Is that a direct Poirot reference?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Probably.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
These motherfuckers have been talking about Poirot for literally every fucking conversation.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
I'm in the middle of Blue Train.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Be cool, everyone.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Don't spoil Mystery of the Blue Train, everybody.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
I skipped the big four because Justin tells me I don't have to listen to it.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Travis said, apropos of nothing, can I skip the big four?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
It's this all weekend, like all weekend.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
Griffin was in the room, and Travis said, can I skip the big four?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
I'm on the Blue Train.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
And Griffin's like, what the fuck are you talking about?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Are you having an aphasia?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
What are you talking about?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I have a Yahoo here that I'm very excited about.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
We're not done.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
We're not done talking about fucking socks.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Don't move away from Poirot.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
You don't want to talk about socks.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
You just want to talk about Poirot more.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Well, yeah.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
No.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I'll talk about the, OK.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Did we address the viability of socks over shoes?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Thank you.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Because I think people are going to see that and think, that's a fucking regal right there.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Right now, people love their shoes, right?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
You clean, you got those beautiful white Vans.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
You clean them when someone scuffs your Vans, right?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
That's a thing.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
What the fuck are you talking?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
This is more incomprehensible than the Poirot chat.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
I'm talking about damn Daniel.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Didn't damn Daniel have, if you think.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
You're talking about 2017.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
You can't talk about damn Daniel.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
Damn Daniel turned 85, and he died.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
You can't talk about fucking damn Daniel.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
It's September 2017.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
I like that Travis stepped on the thing I was saying to get in his great thing,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
and then looked at me like I'm going to cut the noose down.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
No, no, no, dog.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
You're going to dangle.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
You're going to dangle while I watch.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
I had a joke in my head where the punchline was going to be Patch Adams,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
and you fucking killed me.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
You ruined it.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
And I'm going to watch you dangle.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
Can you make your Patch Adams joke and pull me out?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
No, because it wasn't a joke.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Like 90% of things you say.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
It wasn't a joke.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Then what were you going to say?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
It wasn't a joke.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
It was something I was going to say with increasing levels of volume,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
and then say it like it was a joke, and people would laugh at it.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Our formula, our whole pattern.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
It's classic.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
How about this Yahoo that was sent in?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Hey, so stop.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Holy fucking shit.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
That's weird, right?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Because you're putting a thing on your foot.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
This Yahoo was sent in by Seth Carlson.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
Thank you, Seth.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
This Yahoo answers user Florin asks,

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Florin?

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
Can feeding take place via smell?

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
On a very small scale, of course.

22:56.000 --> 23:02.000
I'm thinking about the sinuses and mucous membranes.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
I feel like the...

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
The end?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Yeah.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Yeah, end of question.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
I'm thinking about them.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
I feel like the vibe of this show got very confrontational,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
and I'd like, in the interest of science,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
if we could just rain it back a little bit.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Let's all get on the same team and say that.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
And make fun of this person for their bad questions.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
We just talked about not being confrontational,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
and you just told me to hold on five times.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
But I said it...

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
I thought I said it in a pleasant...

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Off mic.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
I thought I said it in a pleasant way.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Yeah, it was good.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
I was pleased by it.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Okay.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Because here's the thing, like,

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
you smell and you taste very close together.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
Yeah, those holes are right next door.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
They are face neighbors.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
It is connected.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Let me hit you with this.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
You get a big bowl of soup, a big hearty bowl of soup.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Soup, that's what I was thinking about.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And you smell it, and it smells great

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
because you got it from Panera Bread.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
We got any Panera Bread fans here tonight?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
That's nothing.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
We don't have to do that

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
every time we reference a brand of any kind.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
The steam is coming up off the soup,

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
and it's getting in your nose.

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
What's the steam made out of, if not the soup?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Like, everybody, the reason you didn't laugh very hard

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
at that great joke?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Yeah.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
You're thinking about it now, aren't you?

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Right?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
You're thinking about it.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
The steam is coming up off the soup,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
and you smell it, and it smells like the soup,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
and that's because there's soup in the steam.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Because that's the thing.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
You might say, like, oh, steam is just water vapor.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Okay, cool.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Why does it smell like soup?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Where's the smell come from?

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Yeah, that's weird.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Thanks, Neil deGrasse Tyson.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Nice try.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Because here's the thing.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Imagine this.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
You put some soup on a burner, right?

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Okay.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
You leave it there for too long.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
It dries out, so some soup went away.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
How?

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Where'd it go?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Huh.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
I guess it was in the fucking smell, right?

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
But now this ruins it,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
because now I get my big hearty Panera soup,

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
and I set it down at the table and crack the lid open.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
The steam comes up.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Oh, my soup's getting away.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Yeah.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Soup escapes.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
Sid, can you get nutrients through smell?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Uh, can you get nutrients through smell?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Can you eat with smell?

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Can you eat with smell?

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
She says no.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Sid, play with us.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Sid, play in the space, Sid.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Play in the space with me.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Oh, shit.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Please, Sid.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
What if you could get nutrients through smell,

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
and every time you sneeze,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
you were losing nutrients from your body?

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Whoa!

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Whoa!

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Hold on, wait.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
You suggested that every time you sneeze,

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
you're letting smell out of your body.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Yeah.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Have you ever tried to smell a sneeze?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
I haven't.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
No, I guess not.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
It smells terrible.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
It smells like soup.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Yeah, I had it.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Well, here's the thing, Griffin.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
I was in a hurry.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
You breathe it in through your nose.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Yeah.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Right?

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Where does it go?

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
And that smell?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Holy shit!

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
You're right!

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Sneezes have smell!

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Sneezes have smell!

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Yes.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Excuse us.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
This is a brother moment.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Stop it!

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
This isn't for you.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
This is for us.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
And you breathe in through your nose, right?

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Sneezes have smell, dog.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Yeah.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
All right.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
This hasn't been entertaining at all,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
but I've learned a lot about smelling.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
On the magic school bus!

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
I shaved my head several months ago.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
No, you didn't.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
It's the next question.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
I shaved my head several months ago,

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
and while I'm loving the hashtag bald girl life,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
it's come with a unique problem.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Every once in a while,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
an intrepid stranger on the street,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
the kindest adjective you could use, by the way,

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
I forget what's the question,

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
on the street will approach me and start rubbing my head

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
with absolutely...

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Boo!

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Exactly.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Thank you.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
In their defense, it's a very fuzzy and inviting head,

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
but like...

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Don't defend!

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Don't you dare.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Attack them!

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
In their attack, fuck off!

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Yeah.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
Am I wrong in thinking this is completely unacceptable?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
No.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
What should I do when a total stranger tries to pet me

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
like some kind of weird dog?

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
And that's from Rosie, the razor in New York City.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Yeah, is that you?

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Rosie, are you here?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
No, no.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Are you here?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
All right.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Yeah!

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
All right, here's the thing.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Let me ask you a question.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Okay.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
If you had not shaved your head,

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
and another human being on this planet

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
approached you like this...

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
Like a fucking invasion of the body snatchers.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Yeah.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Would that be okay?

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Absolutely not.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
No.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
It's heinous, and it's awful,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
and I think the only thing you can do is rub their head back,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
but like...

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
But fucking...

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
But fucking hard.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
Like...

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Here's the thing.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
If a stranger walks up to you and rubs your head,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
you could punch them in the face,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
and then if the cops are called,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
and it's like, what happened?

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
That other person always has to start that story with,

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
well, I approached another human being

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
and started touching them.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
So I was rubbing this person's head,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
and then, like there's no...

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
The story's over.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
You're already in handcuffs going to jail.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Do you know Taekwondo?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
If I might suggest...

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Justin, show us a move you might use

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
against a potential...

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
Yeah, what's the answer?

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
What?

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Travis is...

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Set it up.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Travis will play the hair person.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Yeah.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
I'll be Bad Touch.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Travis is Bad Touch,

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
and Justin, you'll play the part of...

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
The Touchy.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
The Touchy.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Okay.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Well, but hopefully you will not be Touch-Ed.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
So here we go.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Yeah, I'll play by play.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Stand over there a little bit

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
so I can actually see you both.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
All right, here we go.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
So, Justin, what is he doing?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Set the scene.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Let's do like a...

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Hey, everybody, let's take it to the audience.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
What's a fun thing for Justin to be doing?

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Painting.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
Painting.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Vaping.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Justin, you're vaping.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
So Justin's just vaping,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
and he doesn't have the hair,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
and Travis is looking at him vaping,

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
and he's coming at him real...

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Hey, Travis, Travis.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Hey, Travis.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Three quarters for me?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
I can't see.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Here we go.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Open up a little bit.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Travis is going,

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
and then Justin chops the hand away with a fist.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Okay, no, no, no, no.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Stop.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Hold on.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Go back.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
You're telling me...

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Now I'm rooting for this guy,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
because you're telling me that you tried to grab,

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
and your hand got punched away once,

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
and you were like, okay.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
That's one.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Oh, no.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Now we're having a fight.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
All right, so let's try again.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Justin's getting punched, punched.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
All right, now my brother's...

30:05.000 --> 30:12.000
Now Justin and Travis are fighting.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Okay.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Justin, when you hit my arm, it hurt really bad.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
I didn't mean to hurt you.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
I've never used TaeKwonDo like that before.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
That was an inappropriate usage.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
It's part of my oath that I will never misuse TaeKwonDo.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
You're out of the dojo.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
It's sad in my...

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
It's not a dojo.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Good try, though.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Bigot.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
I'm sorry I punched you in the tummy.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
It's a...

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
It doesn't matter.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
I just...

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
I swore in my oath I would never misuse TaeKwonDo,

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
and I feel like...

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Justin's going to be off for the rest of the show,

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
because he knows that he's broken his sacred bond.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
I feel like I might have misused TaeKwonDo.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
But you didn't, because look at how many people you made happy.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Okay.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
Y'all promise never to tell Master Cruck at Tri-State TaeKwonDo

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
that I misused TaeKwonDo.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
But Tommy did a great job, because my tendons hurt really bad.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
I didn't mean to hit you.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
I'm really sorry.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I wanted to look good for the stage.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Here.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Do you want some ice or something?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
No, I've got beer.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Okay.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
How about a Yahoo?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Yeah.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
This Yahoo was sent in to me by probably 50 people.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Thank you, 50 people.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Louis, who asks,

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
anyone know a way to take hot sauce to school

31:25.000 --> 31:32.000
without bringing the whole bottle?

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
Is this what Beyoncé was talking about?

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
When she says she has hot sauce in her bag, just some loose,

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
some loose chalula just flowing around in there,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
going hither and yon.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
You could hoop it.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
You could what?

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
What?

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
You could hoop it.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
It's when you...

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Say it.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
You could put a bunch of hot sauce in a condom

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
and put it up your butt.

32:00.000 --> 32:08.000
Let's have...

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I'm not proud of knowing.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
No, nobody's proud.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
The risk reward on this for hot sauce is buck wild.

32:16.000 --> 32:22.000
I hate bland bologna as much as the next guy, for sure,

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
but I'm not sure it's worth anal torture.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
How did he die?

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
Well, he was rubbing this woman's head,

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
and then the condom of hot sauce in his butt exploded.

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
She punched him in the butt, and the hot sauce exploded.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
Anyway, I guess law and order is out of ideas,

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
so this is our series finale, everyone.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
Get out of here, Ice Cube.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
I'm Dick Wolf, and I've been set free.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
You're free, Dick.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
I used my last wish to set you free, Dick Wolf.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
We did an episode where they talked about a condom

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
full of hot sauce in a butt exploding.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
As an IBS sufferer,

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
this would actually be a pretty good, like, simulation,

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
just sort of as an outreach program.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Can I just say how glad I am we do live shows,

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
because it's, like, the one time someone on stage

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
mentions having IBS and people in the audience,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
like, yeah!

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Me too!

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
Yeah, like you just dropped Brian Fellows or Mango.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
Like, oh, my favorite character, IBS.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
I packed my lunch in middle school,

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
and for all three years...

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Did you hoop it?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I hooped it every time.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
And I didn't do a good job.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
It was mostly bags of potato chips and star crunches.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
But I went through a phase where, fuck me,

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
I just wanted some chips and salsa on the go.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
And so I would take a little Tupperware guy,

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
a little Tupper guy full of salsa,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
locker salsa, I guess,

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
that would sit in my locker for four hours,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
and I would have myself a little treat.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
And all of my friends would look at me like,

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
what the fuck are you doing?

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
We have to be seen with you,

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
and you have a Tupperware container of salsa

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
that you have sort of partitioned for yourself.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
This is a thing, and I may have talked about this before,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
but the real is that now as an adult,

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
now as a 33-year-old legal adult,

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
I think about the fact that my lunch strategy was like,

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
I took food, and then I put it in a room temperature box

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
for four hours, and then I ate it.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Like, sometimes it occurs to me

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
that I didn't have a refrigerator at my disposal,

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
and it makes me retroactively sick.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
Like, I have 10-year-old food poisoning.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Yeah.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
The idea that my sandwich with fucking meat on it

34:56.000 --> 35:01.000
sat in a box for like five hours,

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
and then I ate it like a monster.

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
You know, Travis, you saying this reminds me of something.

35:09.000 --> 35:30.000
I want a munch.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I want a munch.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
I want a munch.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
I want a munch.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I want a munch.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I want a munch.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I want a munch.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
I want a munch.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Welcome here to Munch Squad.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
There was so much more to that song than I remembered.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
There was so much more to that song than I remembered.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
It's a big crowd, big show.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
We got to do a big Munch Squad.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
So if you point your browser to ta.co,

36:07.000 --> 36:08.800
you're gonna find the Taco Bell website.

36:08.800 --> 36:09.640
Wait, what?

36:09.640 --> 36:10.480
Holy shit!

36:10.480 --> 36:11.580
Wait, fuck off!

36:11.580 --> 36:13.780
That's a Justin McElroy web address.

36:13.780 --> 36:14.900
No, I wish.

36:14.900 --> 36:16.060
I wish I'd had that foresight,

36:16.060 --> 36:16.900
but they got taco.co.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.900
Did you just hide it from me?

36:18.900 --> 36:20.820
No, I don't want you to look too quick.

36:20.820 --> 36:22.540
Well, no, cause I'm holding the mic in this hand.

36:22.540 --> 36:23.980
I saw a picture of the JPEG.

36:23.980 --> 36:27.460
I saw the JPEG and I wished I hadn't seen it.

36:27.460 --> 36:31.240
So Taco Bell has turned Breakfast Inside Out

36:31.240 --> 36:32.980
with its naked egg taco,

36:32.980 --> 36:37.780
which debuted on August 31st.

36:37.780 --> 36:40.500
That was, this is a press release.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.700
That was the most unappetizing set.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.540
We took your favorite meal,

36:44.540 --> 36:48.940
fucking turned it inside out with a naked egg.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.780
Fuck, a naked egg is,

36:50.780 --> 36:52.200
I'm pretty sure I've seen the video

36:52.200 --> 36:54.540
where you can hatch the egg without the shell

36:54.540 --> 36:56.380
and you wrap it in Saran Wrap.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.220
So-

36:57.220 --> 36:58.520
Thanks BuzzFeed.

36:58.520 --> 37:03.280
So it's a taco shell made of fried egg,

37:03.280 --> 37:07.040
stuffed full of beloved morning flavors.

37:07.040 --> 37:10.120
And it has apparently reinvented

37:10.120 --> 37:11.320
the breakfast taco experience.

37:11.320 --> 37:12.160
Okay, so-

37:12.160 --> 37:13.860
Am I supposed to touch it?

37:15.400 --> 37:17.220
Here's the first problem

37:17.220 --> 37:21.120
that I want you to deal with in your heads.

37:21.120 --> 37:24.160
Imagine a fried egg and it's a big ass circle, okay?

37:24.160 --> 37:27.700
So imagine that and imagine someone folded it up

37:27.700 --> 37:29.520
and then filled it with eggs,

37:29.520 --> 37:31.920
more eggs, gross, and cheese.

37:31.920 --> 37:35.540
Already I have a problem because if you take an egg

37:35.540 --> 37:36.380
and fold it-

37:36.380 --> 37:40.040
Just let me finish, please let me finish for one time.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.900
This is literally my podcast.

37:41.900 --> 37:43.200
Please stop talking to me.

37:43.200 --> 37:47.360
So you take an egg, put more eggs in it,

37:47.360 --> 37:49.200
then you put some cheese and some other items

37:49.200 --> 37:52.640
that I'll discuss later and potatoes, I guess, and stuff.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.940
And you fold it into a taco shape.

37:53.940 --> 37:56.600
Can you imagine that for me in your heads real quick?

37:56.600 --> 37:59.760
Okay, now in your mind's eye,

37:59.760 --> 38:01.480
I want you to put it on its side

38:01.480 --> 38:03.620
and realize that it's a fucking omelet.

38:03.620 --> 38:04.440
Ah.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.120
Taco Bell, you've done nothing.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.920
You've changed adjacency.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.800
You've changed, you've changed-

38:18.800 --> 38:20.200
You've rotated a food 90 degrees.

38:20.200 --> 38:23.680
You've rotated an existing food item, it's nothing.

38:23.680 --> 38:26.040
But let's see how they make something into nothing.

38:26.040 --> 38:28.640
No stranger to shell innovation.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.780
Fuck you that that's even a thing.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.960
Fuck you that that is a problem

38:33.960 --> 38:34.800
that I have to deal with a shell.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.480
No stranger to being a food pervert.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.160
Taco Bell.

38:39.160 --> 38:42.240
Taco Bell got real nasty on this one.

38:42.240 --> 38:45.760
Taco Bell revealed its latest game-changing breakfast

38:45.760 --> 38:48.840
offering the naked egg taco

38:48.840 --> 38:51.000
created with a masterful shell.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Fuck.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.080
Okay.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.640
Words mean nothing anymore.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.480
Let me stop you because the problem

38:56.480 --> 38:58.280
with the use of the word shell is

38:58.280 --> 39:00.320
you know what eggs aren't?

39:00.320 --> 39:01.360
Yeah.

39:01.360 --> 39:02.320
Right.

39:02.320 --> 39:03.240
Yes.

39:04.280 --> 39:07.240
I've never picked up an egg and been like mm.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.680
Like it's floppy.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.120
I think you meant to say I've never picked up an egg.

39:11.120 --> 39:11.960
Period.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.040
With your hands.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.720
You don't do it.

39:14.720 --> 39:19.540
So anyway, the naked egg taco creates a masterful shell

39:19.540 --> 39:21.620
made entirely of a fried egg.

39:21.620 --> 39:25.820
The naked egg taco flips the breakfast classic inside out.

39:25.820 --> 39:26.800
Or on its side.

39:26.800 --> 39:27.680
Or on its side.

39:27.680 --> 39:28.520
Thank you Travis.

39:28.520 --> 39:29.960
That's literally what they're doing.

39:29.960 --> 39:33.400
The reimagined breakfast taco delivers a mouthful

39:33.400 --> 39:35.520
of crispy potatoes, bacon or sausage and cheese.

39:35.520 --> 39:37.040
Oh I just thought about putting it in my mouth

39:37.040 --> 39:38.140
for the first time.

39:39.480 --> 39:42.120
I just thought about the word reimagined

39:42.120 --> 39:44.840
because that pictured people thinking about it.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.200
People thought about it.

39:46.200 --> 39:48.640
Oh guys I've got it.

39:48.640 --> 39:51.200
The guy in question is actually Liz Matthews,

39:51.200 --> 39:54.000
chief food innovation officer at Taco Bell Corp.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.320
Can you imagine if that was your fucking job title?

39:57.320 --> 39:58.460
Egg toucher.

40:00.320 --> 40:01.160
That's too much.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.320
Give me something nasty.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.560
That's too much pressure.

40:03.560 --> 40:06.480
I would go in day one like listen I can't get this nasty.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.120
I know how nasty you want me to be right now.

40:08.120 --> 40:10.260
I can't get this nasty for you.

40:10.260 --> 40:12.800
Quote from Liz.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.680
The naked egg taco strips down

40:14.680 --> 40:16.280
the traditional breakfast taco.

40:16.280 --> 40:21.280
The traditional breakfast taco.

40:21.280 --> 40:24.560
It strips down your understanding of what it is to eat.

40:24.560 --> 40:27.900
This ain't your grandpa's breakfast taco.

40:29.620 --> 40:30.460
I live in Austin.

40:30.460 --> 40:32.960
I actually have a very clear picture of what a breakfast.

40:32.960 --> 40:35.280
No but I mean a tradition.

40:35.280 --> 40:37.240
Something that needs to be subverted

40:37.240 --> 40:39.880
and dare I perverted is not like,

40:39.880 --> 40:41.880
it's not okay allowing us to deliver

40:41.880 --> 40:43.200
a new flavor experience.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.920
I mean that's a, that's true.

40:44.920 --> 40:45.920
It's eggs.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.000
Wait but what's the, oh hold on, hold on, hold on.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.360
You can't say flavor experience.

40:49.360 --> 40:50.200
No it's just an omelet.

40:50.200 --> 40:51.020
The flavor is eggs.

40:51.020 --> 40:51.860
It's eggs.

40:51.860 --> 40:53.880
It's eggs and potatoes and bacon.

40:53.880 --> 40:54.720
Shell innovation.

40:54.720 --> 40:55.860
Well I've been there.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.440
You didn't say like a meteor rock.

40:59.440 --> 41:00.280
Okay.

41:00.280 --> 41:01.280
Like you're not bringing a heat.

41:01.280 --> 41:02.600
And zebra face.

41:02.600 --> 41:03.440
Okay.

41:03.440 --> 41:06.560
Shell innovation is at the core of where we experiment.

41:06.560 --> 41:08.160
That's fucking sinister.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.960
Can you believe that was.

41:09.960 --> 41:12.040
Honey, honey how was your day at work?

41:12.040 --> 41:12.880
I just can't.

41:12.880 --> 41:13.700
I can't.

41:13.700 --> 41:14.540
Crack it.

41:14.540 --> 41:16.160
Wait.

41:16.160 --> 41:20.740
What if you touched an egg like a nasty person?

41:21.920 --> 41:24.640
Whether it's crispy chicken, biscuits or waffles.

41:24.640 --> 41:26.520
Yeah fucking list your crimes.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.160
Fuck off.

41:28.160 --> 41:31.100
The wrap up menu item classics.

41:31.100 --> 41:35.120
We bring our fans craveable and unexpected, fact.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.480
Food experiences that leave them wanting more.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.800
For the first time ever, this is where it goes off

41:39.800 --> 41:41.640
the rails, dang.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.840
For the first time ever fans at select cities

41:43.840 --> 41:47.040
will have a chance to reserve a table inside Taco Bell.

41:47.040 --> 41:47.880
Oh.

41:50.520 --> 41:53.240
And taste it's newest menu item leading up

41:53.240 --> 41:55.180
to the nationwide debut.

41:55.180 --> 42:00.180
I believe you have a Travis on the, excuse me.

42:00.720 --> 42:02.440
Nasty pink table.

42:04.960 --> 42:08.680
Hey Jeremy do you have plans for Saturday at 10?

42:08.680 --> 42:09.520
No I don't.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.660
What are you thinking of something?

42:10.660 --> 42:14.240
Would you like to get really bad diarrhea with me

42:14.240 --> 42:16.800
and just have it for the rest of the Saturday?

42:17.760 --> 42:20.120
I would love to get bad diarrhea.

42:20.120 --> 42:22.200
Okay when you make that call to Taco Bell,

42:22.200 --> 42:25.460
one, who's the poor person who has to answer that?

42:27.160 --> 42:29.600
This is Taco Bell I guess.

42:30.880 --> 42:31.920
You want a what?

42:34.160 --> 42:36.360
Yeah, cause you're gonna have to have the conversation

42:36.360 --> 42:39.640
with this poor employee who just started three weeks ago

42:39.640 --> 42:41.800
that like no on that day they are in fact

42:41.800 --> 42:42.640
taking reservations.

42:43.760 --> 42:46.360
You have to try to sell them that bill of goods.

42:48.400 --> 42:51.200
I'd like a table near the bathroom please.

42:52.160 --> 42:53.960
Obviously, okay thank you.

42:53.960 --> 42:56.760
And it goes without saying, table for one.

42:56.760 --> 42:59.320
Can I reserve the toilet?

43:01.360 --> 43:05.140
Slide it under the door, I'll be ready to go.

43:06.840 --> 43:09.560
Events will kick off in New York on Thursday,

43:09.560 --> 43:10.400
how'd it go?

43:11.960 --> 43:14.740
We'll continue with experiences at Taco Bell restaurants

43:14.740 --> 43:18.600
in Laguna Beach, Austin, Texas, good, good, good.

43:18.600 --> 43:21.400
And Chicago, you just get in that reservation on your phone,

43:21.400 --> 43:23.200
it's over, you missed it.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.520
You get through open table.

43:25.520 --> 43:28.920
Fans unable to score a seat are encouraged to follow along

43:28.920 --> 43:31.560
using the hashtag naked egg taco.

43:31.560 --> 43:33.760
Can you imagine?

43:33.760 --> 43:36.900
Can you imagine, oh I couldn't get a table.

43:36.900 --> 43:39.600
Oh I just have to see how it goes.

43:39.600 --> 43:42.320
I gotta be there for every minute of it.

43:44.200 --> 43:46.800
If I ever find naked egg taco in your search history

43:46.800 --> 43:49.280
on Twitter, I'm going to put you in prison.

43:49.280 --> 43:51.620
This is fair warning, you're going to prison.

43:51.620 --> 43:52.460
Anyway.

43:52.460 --> 44:08.040
Hey folks, this is Griffin McElroy, just Griffin, thank you all for listening to our live show

44:08.040 --> 44:10.680
from the beautiful King's Theater in Brooklyn, New York.

44:10.680 --> 44:14.960
It was a pretty buck wild show, I don't know if you get this just from listening to it

44:14.960 --> 44:20.840
but the King's Theater is like this huge opulent wonder theater where like 3000 people were

44:20.840 --> 44:26.280
there and it was, I can't believe that they let us even into the theater, let alone perform

44:26.280 --> 44:27.280
a show there.

44:27.280 --> 44:33.000
So thank you all very much and thanks to our special guests, Lynn, Manuel Miranda, and

44:33.000 --> 44:37.200
our other special guest who is going to be helping us out with audience Q&A here in just

44:37.200 --> 44:38.200
a little bit.

44:38.200 --> 44:41.160
Before we get to that, I got some ads to tell you about but before we get to the ads, I

44:41.160 --> 44:48.080
wanted to say we have a show that we've added to our next tour, our Midwest tour in November.

44:48.080 --> 44:52.600
On November 16th, Thursday, November 16th, we added another show in Chicago and there

44:52.600 --> 44:54.100
are still tickets available.

44:54.100 --> 44:59.080
If you want to see us in Chicago, just go to McElroyShows.com slash tours and you can

44:59.080 --> 45:01.200
find ticket links there.

45:01.200 --> 45:03.720
Yeah, that'll be next month.

45:03.720 --> 45:08.140
Here this weekend though, we're going to be up in, or I guess down in Atlanta and Nashville

45:08.140 --> 45:09.320
so we'll see everybody there.

45:09.320 --> 45:13.720
I think there might be some tickets available for those shows as well so we will see you

45:13.720 --> 45:15.880
all real, real soon.

45:15.880 --> 45:18.400
All right, let's talk about our sponsors this week.

45:18.400 --> 45:20.960
Our first sponsor is Lyft.

45:20.960 --> 45:26.480
Lyft is a service where you get on your thing and you call a car, well you don't call a

45:26.480 --> 45:31.360
car, you just get a car on the application, like an application, kind of like Flappy Bird

45:31.360 --> 45:35.720
and then the car shows up and then you get in it and it takes you to where it is that

45:35.720 --> 45:38.320
you need to go.

45:38.320 --> 45:42.080
Nine out of ten Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating and they're the first rideshare

45:42.080 --> 45:44.200
platform with tipping built right into the app.

45:44.200 --> 45:47.840
If you're a driver, you keep 100% of the tips and they add up fast.

45:47.840 --> 45:50.780
So join the ridesharing company that believes in treating its people better.

45:50.780 --> 45:56.440
Just go to Lyft.com, that's L-Y-F-T by the way, you probably knew that, Lyft.com slash

45:56.440 --> 46:00.440
brother today and you can get a $500 new driver bonus.

46:00.440 --> 46:06.280
That's Lyft.com slash brother, Lyft.com slash brother, limited time only, terms apply.

46:06.280 --> 46:07.640
Also I want to tell you about Bowling Branch.

46:07.640 --> 46:12.840
Bowling Branch makes really fantastic sheets that when you sleep on them, when you wake

46:12.840 --> 46:19.360
up the next morning, you're taller and food tastes better and colors are more vivid.

46:19.360 --> 46:24.400
They said not to specifically say that it makes you taller and jump better and makes

46:24.400 --> 46:27.960
food taste better but I just, it's the damn truth.

46:27.960 --> 46:32.920
What makes these sheets unique is that each one is crafted from 100% organic cotton, that

46:32.920 --> 46:36.120
means Bowling Branch sheets not only feel incredible but they also look amazing and

46:36.120 --> 46:39.160
you're going to get twice the comfort and style at half the price.

46:39.160 --> 46:42.520
You can try these sheets for 30 nights and if you're not impressed, you just return them

46:42.520 --> 46:43.520
for a full refund.

46:43.520 --> 46:47.560
Just go to BowlingBranch.com today and you'll get $50 off your first set of sheets plus

46:47.560 --> 46:52.480
free shipping when you use the promo code MYBROTHER, that's $50 off plus free shipping

46:52.480 --> 47:00.280
right now at BowlingBranch.com, that's B-O-L-L and Branch.com, promo code MYBROTHER, BowlingBranch.com

47:00.280 --> 47:01.960
promo code MYBROTHER.

47:01.960 --> 47:06.080
I've got some Jumbotrons to tell you about but before that, Jumbotrons are going back

47:06.080 --> 47:13.100
on sale for a lot of our shows on Wednesday, November 1st at 11am Pacific Time.

47:13.100 --> 47:18.360
MaxFun will be selling all spots available for the first six months of 2018 and if the

47:18.360 --> 47:22.320
last few sales like this are any indication, these are going to go very, very fast so if

47:22.320 --> 47:26.400
you want to get a message on the show, go to MaximumFun.org slash Jumbotron for more

47:26.400 --> 47:30.680
details again Wednesday, November 1st at 11am Pacific Time.

47:30.680 --> 47:35.280
This first Jumbotron is going to tell you all about MaxFun NYC.

47:35.280 --> 47:37.560
You live in or around NYC?

47:37.560 --> 47:40.000
That's New York City.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.720
New York City?

47:41.720 --> 47:44.280
Like the old salsa commercials?

47:44.280 --> 47:51.440
Visit MaxFun dot NYC slash join to make new Maximum Fun loving friends, have amazing adventures,

47:51.440 --> 47:53.200
and get the most out of your city.

47:53.200 --> 47:58.760
With 1500 plus members, MaxFun NYC is the Greater NYC Area's unofficial Maximum Fun

47:58.760 --> 48:00.680
fan and friend community.

48:00.680 --> 48:04.240
We share tickets to shows and podcast recordings, play D&D.

48:04.240 --> 48:06.800
Most of us started after Taz, thank you.

48:06.800 --> 48:12.480
We do monthly karaoke, eat and review crazy food in our Munch Squad, and throw events

48:12.480 --> 48:19.120
like a recent trip to be near horses at Medieval Times or our upcoming Halloween party.

48:19.120 --> 48:20.320
Tickets still available.

48:20.320 --> 48:24.120
It's a great way to make new, genuinely nice friends who totally get all your good, good

48:24.120 --> 48:25.120
McElroy references.

48:25.120 --> 48:26.120
This is a good bunch.

48:26.120 --> 48:31.000
This is a good bunch of folks and if you live in the New York area, specifically New York

48:31.000 --> 48:34.360
City, like the salsa commercial, then you should check it out.

48:34.360 --> 48:38.120
Again, MaxFun dot NYC slash join.

48:38.120 --> 48:39.120
Got another message here.

48:39.120 --> 48:45.760
This one's for Heather and it's from James who says, Dear Hev, or Heath, probably Hev,

48:45.760 --> 48:46.760
happy birthday.

48:46.760 --> 48:50.640
Thanks for putting up with my weird job and letting me travel around with questionable

48:50.640 --> 48:55.840
folks in these somewhat questionable bands and being there to pick me up from the airport

48:55.840 --> 48:58.760
no matter how shitty these Canadian roads are.

48:58.760 --> 49:00.720
Here's to many more of my bim bam picnics.

49:00.720 --> 49:04.360
I hope this non-surprising surprise makes your week.

49:04.360 --> 49:05.360
Love, JB.

49:05.360 --> 49:07.160
What's in my bim bam picnic?

49:07.160 --> 49:08.160
I gotta know.

49:08.160 --> 49:10.360
Are you having one right now?

49:10.360 --> 49:11.540
Watch out for ants.

49:11.540 --> 49:13.200
They're in the jelly.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.200
No!

49:14.200 --> 49:17.320
Get out of here, ants, dammit.

49:17.320 --> 49:19.840
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

49:19.840 --> 49:21.600
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

49:21.600 --> 49:27.040
It's a fantastic album that makes for a very spooky Halloween season, I guess.

49:27.040 --> 49:28.720
Thank you also to Maximum Fun for having us.

49:28.720 --> 49:31.480
You can go to MaximumFun.org and check out all the great podcasts there.

49:31.480 --> 49:37.920
Shows like Lady to Lady, The Greatest Generation, The Beef and Dairy Network, Tights and Fights,

49:37.920 --> 49:39.800
a bunch of good shows all at MaximumFun.org.

49:39.800 --> 49:42.880
And if you want to check out other shows and videos and stuff that we do, you can go to

49:42.880 --> 49:43.880
McElroyShows.com.

49:43.880 --> 49:44.880
Okay, that's it.

49:44.880 --> 49:48.980
I'm going to get back to the episode now.

49:48.980 --> 49:51.800
Thank you again for bearing with us for these live apps.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.880
I know it's not everybody's cup of tea.

49:53.880 --> 49:57.720
Next one will probably be either our live show from Atlanta or Nashville, and then we're

49:57.720 --> 50:02.920
going to get right back into, you know, making the sausage, I guess.

50:02.920 --> 50:05.400
I don't know why I put it that way.

50:05.400 --> 50:12.600
But yeah, Southeast, we're coming for you this weekend, and enjoy the rest of the episode.

50:12.600 --> 50:14.560
Bye.

50:14.560 --> 50:16.680
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my favor.

50:16.680 --> 50:19.220
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my friend's favor.

50:19.220 --> 50:22.000
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my favor.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.240
I'm Judge John Hodgman.

50:24.240 --> 50:27.960
You're hearing the voices of real litigants, real people who have submitted disputes to

50:27.960 --> 50:31.180
my internet court at the Judge John Hodgman podcast.

50:31.180 --> 50:35.360
I hear their cases, I ask them questions, they're good ones, and then I tell them who's

50:35.360 --> 50:37.200
right and who's wrong.

50:37.200 --> 50:41.080
Thanks to Judge John Hodgman's ruling, my dad has been forced to retire, one of the

50:41.080 --> 50:43.600
worst dad jokes of all time.

50:43.600 --> 50:49.200
Instead of cutting his own hair with a flowbee, my husband has his hair cut professionally.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.180
I have to join a community theater group.

50:51.180 --> 50:53.800
And my wife has stopped bringing home wild animals.

50:53.800 --> 50:56.680
It's the Judge John Hodgman podcast.

50:56.680 --> 51:03.560
Find it every Wednesday at MaximumFun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

51:03.560 --> 51:06.160
Thanks Judge John Hodgman.

51:06.160 --> 51:07.880
That's-

51:07.880 --> 51:13.440
Should we move on to audience questions?

51:13.440 --> 51:14.440
Yes.

51:14.440 --> 51:15.440
All right.

51:15.440 --> 51:20.320
So we've come to the point in the night where we take audience questions, first and foremost,

51:20.320 --> 51:24.680
there's one rule.

51:24.680 --> 51:29.160
So if you start your question with, this might sound like a bummer, but-

51:29.160 --> 51:33.000
We've been hurt before.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.280
But here we are in New York, the biggest little city.

51:37.280 --> 51:38.280
Is that right?

51:38.280 --> 51:39.280
No.

51:39.280 --> 51:40.280
Okay.

51:40.280 --> 51:41.280
Beantown.

51:41.280 --> 51:42.280
And-

51:42.280 --> 51:43.280
That's Sunday.

51:43.280 --> 51:44.280
Okay.

51:44.280 --> 51:47.200
But here's a- What is it?

51:47.200 --> 51:48.200
Big Snapple?

51:48.200 --> 51:49.200
Huh.

51:49.200 --> 51:50.200
That's weird.

51:50.200 --> 51:51.200
All right.

51:51.200 --> 51:52.200
Move it along.

51:52.200 --> 52:01.560
But in order to answer these questions accurately, we found ourselves in need of an expert.

52:01.560 --> 52:06.640
And so we brought an expert in, if he could join us now.

52:06.640 --> 52:11.720
Ladies and gentlemen, our dear friend, the smartest guy we know, John Hodgman.

52:11.720 --> 52:18.960
Do we have a fourth seat?

52:18.960 --> 52:21.360
Oh, we do.

52:21.360 --> 52:23.360
Thank you.

52:23.360 --> 52:25.620
Thank you very much.

52:25.620 --> 52:31.840
Thank you for that big naked egg Taco Berg welcome.

52:31.840 --> 52:35.840
I'm so disappointed that you did not opt to sit at the piano, John.

52:35.840 --> 52:38.320
That was the visual I was hoping for.

52:38.320 --> 52:39.320
I don't play the piano.

52:39.320 --> 52:40.320
No.

52:40.320 --> 52:41.320
John, what have you brought with you?

52:41.320 --> 52:42.320
Well, John.

52:42.320 --> 52:48.840
Oh, just some copies of my new book, Vacationland, to be published October 24th.

52:48.840 --> 52:51.120
I brought one for each of you.

52:51.120 --> 52:52.120
Oh, thank you.

52:52.120 --> 52:55.280
And one for yourself.

52:55.280 --> 52:59.000
And one for myself or one for the- Would you just need me to sign this on the

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
inside?

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
Yeah.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
If you don't mind.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
Yes.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
Just to validate my parking, please.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
Thank you very much.

53:05.000 --> 53:09.200
I was hoping there'd be the bit in the middle, like they do in the novelizations of like

53:09.200 --> 53:13.520
Star Wars books, where there's like pictures of you just like hanging out, wearing some

53:13.520 --> 53:14.520
shorts.

53:14.520 --> 53:16.200
That'll be for the paperback for sure.

53:16.200 --> 53:17.200
Okay.

53:17.200 --> 53:19.120
Wait, this isn't the paperback, John?

53:19.120 --> 53:20.120
No.

53:20.120 --> 53:22.080
These are advanced reader's copies.

53:22.080 --> 53:23.720
You can't get this shit.

53:23.720 --> 53:26.200
I'm selling this after the show.

53:26.200 --> 53:30.240
Can we get some house lights up, please?

53:30.240 --> 53:31.560
So I see the people have lined up.

53:31.560 --> 53:32.800
This is not how we usually do it.

53:32.800 --> 53:33.800
Fuck it.

53:33.800 --> 53:34.800
Let's roll with it because there's a lot of folks that-

53:34.800 --> 53:35.800
But wait.

53:35.800 --> 53:36.800
Don't come line up.

53:36.800 --> 53:37.800
After they're done, we'll call.

53:37.800 --> 53:38.800
No.

53:38.800 --> 53:39.800
There's no way we're getting through these people.

53:39.800 --> 53:40.800
That's enough.

53:40.800 --> 53:41.800
Okay.

53:41.800 --> 53:43.480
In fact, count back five.

53:43.480 --> 53:44.480
That's probably good.

53:44.480 --> 53:45.480
Go sit down.

53:45.480 --> 53:46.480
Okay.

53:46.480 --> 53:48.320
Let's get through as many as we can.

53:48.320 --> 53:49.320
What's your name?

53:49.320 --> 53:50.880
My name is Dee Stein.

53:50.880 --> 53:51.880
Hi.

53:51.880 --> 53:52.880
Hello.

53:52.880 --> 53:53.880
Hello.

53:53.880 --> 53:58.480
You guys, I think, went to high school with a good friend of mine, Brandon McCoy.

53:58.480 --> 53:59.480
Yeah.

53:59.480 --> 54:00.480
Oh, yeah.

54:00.480 --> 54:01.480
Yeah.

54:01.480 --> 54:02.480
I did not.

54:02.480 --> 54:03.480
College.

54:03.480 --> 54:04.480
College.

54:04.480 --> 54:05.480
He just had a baby.

54:05.480 --> 54:06.480
Oh, great.

54:06.480 --> 54:07.480
Yeah.

54:07.480 --> 54:08.480
His first kid, Shyla Mae.

54:08.480 --> 54:09.480
So I was hoping-

54:09.480 --> 54:10.480
No names, please.

54:10.480 --> 54:11.480
Sorry.

54:11.480 --> 54:12.480
I'll edit it out.

54:12.480 --> 54:13.480
As a bunch of sweet young dads.

54:13.480 --> 54:18.080
Do you have any pro advice besides don't drop shit on the baby's face?

54:18.080 --> 54:24.120
John, if you were to sum up all of your parenting knowledge in one sentence, what would it be?

54:24.120 --> 54:26.640
Don't talk too much.

54:26.640 --> 54:28.360
Let that baby tell you what it needs.

54:28.360 --> 54:30.520
Don't tell it what it needs.

54:30.520 --> 54:31.520
That's actually really good.

54:31.520 --> 54:32.520
That's good.

54:32.520 --> 54:33.520
That's so good.

54:33.520 --> 54:36.800
Especially when the baby can't talk anyway, so the two of you can just be quiet together

54:36.800 --> 54:37.800
for a while.

54:37.800 --> 54:38.800
Just savor the peace.

54:38.800 --> 54:40.040
That's the thing.

54:40.040 --> 54:41.840
Babies actually don't need that much.

54:41.840 --> 54:44.600
You think they do, but just wait until they ask you for something.

54:44.600 --> 54:45.600
You'll be fine.

54:45.600 --> 54:48.800
You know what babies really don't need?

54:48.800 --> 54:49.800
Dads.

54:49.800 --> 54:51.900
Little babies.

54:51.900 --> 54:55.760
You will not tell all of our good friend from college.

54:55.760 --> 54:56.760
Brandon.

54:56.760 --> 54:57.760
Brandon.

54:57.760 --> 55:02.360
And what was the name of the baby again that you revealed without consulting your friend?

55:02.360 --> 55:03.360
Shyla Mae.

55:03.360 --> 55:04.360
Shyla Mae Brandon.

55:04.360 --> 55:05.360
Shyla Mae Brandon.

55:05.360 --> 55:07.560
I'm sure that's not it.

55:07.560 --> 55:14.800
Shyla Mae will not know or care that Brandon exists for about seven years.

55:14.800 --> 55:21.240
So Brandon should be watching as much series television as he can right now.

55:21.240 --> 55:22.240
Does that help?

55:22.240 --> 55:23.240
I hope so.

55:23.240 --> 55:24.240
Excellent.

55:24.240 --> 55:25.240
All right.

55:25.240 --> 55:26.240
Hello.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.240
Hi.

55:27.240 --> 55:28.240
Hi.

55:28.240 --> 55:29.240
What's your name?

55:29.240 --> 55:30.240
I'm Nina.

55:30.240 --> 55:31.240
Hi, Nina.

55:31.240 --> 55:32.240
Wait.

55:32.240 --> 55:33.240
Can I just say, have you all now just sat down in the aisle?

55:33.240 --> 55:34.240
That is so cool of y'all.

55:34.240 --> 55:35.240
We didn't want to block the view.

55:35.240 --> 55:36.240
That's so smart.

55:36.240 --> 55:37.240
Thank you.

55:37.240 --> 55:38.240
Thank you.

55:38.240 --> 55:39.240
I appreciate this audience is so cute.

55:39.240 --> 55:40.240
This line?

55:40.240 --> 55:41.240
Right line hasn't figured it out yet.

55:41.240 --> 55:42.240
All right.

55:42.240 --> 55:43.240
Come on.

55:43.240 --> 55:44.240
All right.

55:44.240 --> 55:45.240
Sit down.

55:45.240 --> 55:46.240
That line knows the score.

55:46.240 --> 55:47.240
Hey.

55:47.240 --> 55:48.240
Okay.

55:48.240 --> 55:50.240
So I dated a girl in high school six years ago.

55:50.240 --> 55:51.240
Okay.

55:51.240 --> 55:52.240
Sorry.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.240
It seems like you just realized how long ago high school was.

55:54.240 --> 55:55.240
We're not going to know that better than you.

55:55.240 --> 55:56.240
I get it.

55:56.240 --> 55:57.240
For sure.

55:57.240 --> 55:58.240
Okay.

55:58.240 --> 55:59.240
And so I saw her-

55:59.240 --> 56:00.240
Are you looking?

56:00.240 --> 56:01.240
Are you looking up?

56:01.240 --> 56:02.240
When did you go to high school?

56:02.240 --> 56:03.240
Click, click, click.

56:03.240 --> 56:04.240
Okay.

56:04.240 --> 56:08.240
So I dated a food lion when I was home for a day this August.

56:08.240 --> 56:09.240
Okay.

56:09.240 --> 56:10.240
Okay.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.240
So she made me...

56:11.240 --> 56:17.240
The girl I dated, she gave me this necklace that she made before we dated.

56:17.240 --> 56:18.240
Okay.

56:18.240 --> 56:19.240
Okay.

56:19.240 --> 56:21.240
And her friend asked me when am I giving it back.

56:21.240 --> 56:22.240
Oh, shit.

56:22.240 --> 56:23.240
Is this some dating protocol?

56:23.240 --> 56:24.240
I never-

56:24.240 --> 56:25.240
No.

56:25.240 --> 56:26.240
Am I?

56:26.240 --> 56:27.240
No, no, no, no, no.

56:27.240 --> 56:28.240
What?

56:28.240 --> 56:29.240
No, no, no, no, no.

56:29.240 --> 56:30.240
What?

56:30.240 --> 56:31.240
No, no, no, no, no.

56:31.240 --> 56:32.240
What?

56:32.240 --> 56:33.240
No, no, no, no, no.

56:33.240 --> 56:34.240
What?

56:34.240 --> 56:37.240
I just thought it was buck wild.

56:37.240 --> 56:38.240
Yeah.

56:38.240 --> 56:39.240
Buck wild indeed.

56:39.240 --> 56:46.040
What is your ex or anybody they will ever know going to do with the special necklace

56:46.040 --> 56:47.440
that she made for you?

56:47.440 --> 56:49.360
That is the most buck wild thing I've ever heard.

56:49.360 --> 56:54.560
Can I tell you straight up, no matter what the situation is, anyone who says, when are

56:54.560 --> 57:03.000
you going to give that thing I gave you with no agreement previous about back?

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
That's not a thing.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
That's not a thing.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
That's nothing.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
That's nothing.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
Thank you.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.600
If someone says, I got this book for you, and then two years later is like, when am

57:13.600 --> 57:15.400
I going to get that book back?

57:15.400 --> 57:18.840
Hey, Nina, I got this book for you.

57:18.840 --> 57:22.200
It's called Vacationland.

57:22.200 --> 57:23.200
Please don't throw it.

57:23.200 --> 57:24.200
Oh, fuck.

57:24.200 --> 57:25.200
Okay.

57:25.200 --> 57:26.200
Would you hand that back to her?

57:26.200 --> 57:27.200
Hand that back to Nina.

57:27.200 --> 57:28.200
Hey, great.

57:28.200 --> 57:29.200
Congratulations, Nina.

57:29.200 --> 57:30.200
That's good.

57:30.200 --> 57:31.200
Good read.

57:31.200 --> 57:35.400
Now, that's a very kind gesture.

57:35.400 --> 57:38.800
I'd like that back in three months, please.

57:38.800 --> 57:39.800
Not now.

57:39.800 --> 57:40.800
No.

57:40.800 --> 57:46.000
That's called a gift, and I do not expect it back, even if we become mortal enemies.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.880
Thank you, Todd Huntsman.

57:48.880 --> 57:49.880
You're welcome.

57:49.880 --> 57:52.320
And he is planning on becoming mortal enemies.

57:52.320 --> 57:54.120
Don't get it twisted.

57:54.120 --> 57:56.920
Oh, Nina, and you know why, too.

57:56.920 --> 57:58.960
Do we help?

57:58.960 --> 57:59.960
Yes.

57:59.960 --> 58:00.960
All right.

58:00.960 --> 58:01.960
Hi.

58:01.960 --> 58:02.960
Hi.

58:02.960 --> 58:03.960
Hi.

58:03.960 --> 58:04.960
My name's Jack.

58:04.960 --> 58:05.960
Hi, Jack.

58:05.960 --> 58:11.560
And over the summer, my best friend, he came out with me and some of my family to Montauk

58:11.560 --> 58:12.560
out in the beach.

58:12.560 --> 58:13.560
Nice place.

58:13.560 --> 58:14.560
Nice place.

58:14.560 --> 58:17.920
If you can drive and are independently mobile, I'm not so much that.

58:17.920 --> 58:20.480
So it's kind of a sandy prison.

58:20.480 --> 58:21.480
Can you do me a big favor?

58:21.480 --> 58:22.480
Yes.

58:22.480 --> 58:24.480
Can you turn your hat backwards like you're really cool?

58:24.480 --> 58:26.480
Because all I can see is that there we go.

58:26.480 --> 58:29.240
There's a light shining perfectly down on you.

58:29.240 --> 58:31.360
And so it looked like you were headless.

58:31.360 --> 58:32.360
It was very.

58:32.360 --> 58:36.320
And I was getting scared that there was some sort of specter or ghoul situation.

58:36.320 --> 58:38.320
Spook, specter, or ghost.

58:38.320 --> 58:39.320
Okay.

58:39.320 --> 58:42.920
So we were in a car with some of my extended family.

58:42.920 --> 58:51.800
And out in Montauk, there's this place called Gossman's Dock, and there's an ice cream location,

58:51.800 --> 58:52.800
a brand.

58:52.800 --> 58:53.800
Am I allowed to say brands?

58:53.800 --> 58:54.800
You already did.

58:54.800 --> 58:57.800
You heard the bit about Taco Bell, right, my man?

58:57.800 --> 58:58.800
For sure?

58:58.800 --> 58:59.800
Okay.

58:59.800 --> 59:00.800
Go ahead.

59:00.800 --> 59:01.800
All right.

59:01.800 --> 59:02.800
All right.

59:02.800 --> 59:03.800
So it's a Ben and Jerry's.

59:03.800 --> 59:04.800
Okay.

59:04.800 --> 59:05.800
So we're in the car.

59:05.800 --> 59:06.800
We're planning to go to a steak for dinner, and then Ben and Jerry's after.

59:06.800 --> 59:11.640
And so my cousin mentions Ben and Jerry's, and my friend Noah, he turns to me and says

59:11.640 --> 59:15.520
what?

59:15.520 --> 59:22.480
And for the next, I shit you not, four hours, Noah maintains under constant interrogation,

59:22.480 --> 59:29.200
the pretense that he, a 20-something dude from New York City, has never heard of Ben

59:29.200 --> 59:30.200
and Jerry's.

59:30.200 --> 59:31.200
Okay.

59:31.200 --> 59:32.200
Okay.

59:32.200 --> 59:33.200
Let me tell you something, Jack.

59:33.200 --> 59:34.200
He is fucking with you.

59:34.200 --> 59:35.200
Yes.

59:35.200 --> 59:36.200
Oh, no, no, no.

59:36.200 --> 59:37.200
Yeah, for sure.

59:37.200 --> 59:38.200
You were being...

59:38.200 --> 59:39.200
So we're in line after dinner at the Ben and Jerry's.

59:39.200 --> 59:42.200
Once he's standing in the Ben and Jerry's like, I don't believe this.

59:42.200 --> 59:44.720
There's no way.

59:44.720 --> 59:51.760
And he taps me on the shoulder and shows me a photo from his Facebook timeline of him

59:51.760 --> 59:56.120
and another one of his friends sticking their heads through a B-Ben and Jerry, Ben and Jerry's

59:56.120 --> 59:57.120
fucking dick.

59:57.120 --> 01:00:03.120
Oh, so he was like, he was like, that's the prestige, like, got you.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.920
So wait, what do you need advice on?

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.920
Yeah, what do you need us for?

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:06.920
How can I ever...

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.920
How can I...

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.920
How do you kill him?

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.920
How can I ever trust him again?

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.920
You can't.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.920
You've got your friend anywhere.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:12.920
You smother him in chunky monkey.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:13.920
Yeah, you gotta kill him with...

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.920
Hey, Noah.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.920
Hey, Noah.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.920
Hey, Noah.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.920
Noah.

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.920
Fuck you.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.920
You're dead to Jack.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.920
Yeah, fuck you, Noah.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920
Noah.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.920
Noah.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:23.920
This is a weird turn for the...

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.320
We've never done this before, but...

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.320
Fuck you, Noah.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.320
I guess.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.320
Thank you, Jack.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.320
Thank you.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.320
Thank you.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.320
Thank you so much.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.320
Yes.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.320
Hi, my name is Nadia.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.320
Hi, Nadia.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.320
Who do you want us to say fuck you to, Nadia?

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.320
Who do you want us to burn down?

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.320
It's apparently what we're doing now.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.320
Hey, the rest of this...

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.320
Yeah, the rest of this episode, if you just want us to say fuck you to someone, fuck you

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.320
to...

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.320
This is our burn book episode.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.320
Yeah, this is our burn book episode.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.320
Who do you want to say fuck you to?

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.320
Say fuck you to Tom.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.320
He knows who he is.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.320
Tom.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.320
Tom.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.320
Tom.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.320
Tom, he knows who he is.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.320
Tom.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.320
Fuck off, Tom.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.320
Eat shit, dude.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.320
Tom, you know who the fuck you are.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.320
Hey, Tom.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.840
I'm putting Tom on my Nina list.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.520
Tom, everybody knows your game.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.520
Fuck off.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.520
All right, go ahead, Nadia.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.520
Sorry.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.840
All right, so when I was a child, I was...

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.840
Wait, hold on.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:13.080
Let's settle in.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:19.240
I remember summers at winter shims.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.040
When I was a child, I was very sensitive to horror movies.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.240
I would see a trailer and I would be horrified.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.240
I'd cry the whole night long.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.600
It didn't even have to be horror movies.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.480
It was mildly spooky.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.480
I'd be ruined.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.480
Don't turn around.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:37.240
There's a big skeleton right...

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.120
No, you looked.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:44.800
Thank you to the person behind you who pretended to be a big skeleton.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.280
That was a tough improv that we gave you, but you reformed out of it.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.280
You ran with it.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.280
Oh, yeah.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.280
It's a Ghostbusters shirt.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.280
It's very wonderful.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.280
Okay.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.280
Okay.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:59.000
So I started getting very good at avoiding trailers, but then when I would see a horror

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.640
movie poster, I would just wonder, what's the story?

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.360
So I would Wikipedia the plot and...

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.360
Hold on.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.760
Nadia, I'm going to let...

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.120
Please let Nadia finish because this is only going to get better.

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.720
I just cannot imagine.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.720
This is unfathomable.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.720
Please go ahead.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.920
And then, you know, I wouldn't sleep the whole night long.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.840
From the Wikipedia entries, I got it.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.840
Yeah.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:20.840
That you read willingly.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:26.040
But then I learned, you know, not to do that anymore, so I had a few quiet years where

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.240
I only slept badly because...

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.760
I cannot wait for the elevation of your depravity.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.760
Go ahead.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:37.840
So I had a few years where I slept badly just because I have issues.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.560
Is she okay?

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:47.560
But then, in the middle of August, I was at my job and I listened to podcasts while I

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.560
work.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.560
Okay.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.560
Uh-oh.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.160
And I saw in the little recommended thing something called the no sleep podcast.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.160
Oh, no.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:59.440
And then I thought to myself, I'm an adult now.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.160
I'll be okay.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:07.800
So I listened for the whole workday from 9 to 5, and I was like, this is great.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.840
This is a great podcast.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.100
I'm fine.

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:11.720
And then the night came.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:17.320
This, I want to tell you, I don't know if this is a question or if this is a good podcast

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.320
or anything.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.320
I'm fucking hooked.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.320
Yeah.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.320
Wherever you're going.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:23.720
This is like S-Town, but on our thing.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.720
And then the night came.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.000
For those of you listening along at home, she's got a flashlight underneath her chin

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.640
as she passes through.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.480
And then the night came.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.640
And then this is not a joke.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.160
I've had to pee for about 30 minutes and now I'm so spooked that it's going to come out

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.520
of me if I don't run off the stage.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.880
But we have monitors in the bathrooms back there, so I'm going to listen to the rest

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:50.880
of it.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.720
I promise I'll be back in time to give you advice.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.720
Just project.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.720
All right.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.720
Go ahead.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.720
See.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:03:59.720
So where were you?

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:06.240
So, you know, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:12.320
What I want you to do is go into the bathroom behind him and when he's washing his face

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.320
in the mirror, just go.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.320
Okay.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.320
And I tell you.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.320
All right.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.320
Everybody be quiet for a second.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.320
Let Griffin think the monitors aren't working.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.320
Wait, wait, wait.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.320
Hello.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.320
No, no, no.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.320
This is the water.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.320
And this is the well.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320
Drink.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.320
Babadook.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.320
Do you do that on babies?

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:39.040
We do that on baby monitors at home.

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:43.160
We wait till the other one is alone in the room where the other end of the monitor is.

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.160
We get real close to it.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.160
Just go.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.160
Babadook.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.160
We've taught Charlie to do it, which is adorable.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.160
All right.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.160
Welcome back to the stage.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.040
I can go for another fucking hour.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.040
Let's do this.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.040
Okay.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.040
What's the question?

01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:00.040
How do I break this horrible, painful, yet pleasurable cycle?

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:04.320
Let me help you stop listening to this podcast.

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.040
You enjoy it, but it keeps you awake.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.600
Is that what you're saying?

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.600
Yes.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:13.120
So you either have to stop listening to this stuff and don't even read the Wikipedia page

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.120
or just keep going until you're not scared of it anymore.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.920
Ooh, I like that.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:19.920
Immersion therapy.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.760
I get to the end of the podcast and find out.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:25.080
You have what Edgar Allen Poe calls the imp of the perverse, an attraction to the thing

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.400
that you know is bad for you.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.400
Edgar Allen Poe's here.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.400
What's up, my man?

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.400
That's right.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:34.680
Hey, dude, spooky books.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.120
You're never going to break this attraction.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.840
You have to work your way through it.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:38.840
Yeah, I like that.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:39.920
So I'll get you bored of it.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:45.240
So let's go see it this weekend.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.240
So does that help?

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.240
Sing it with John Hodgman.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.240
Sing it with John Hodgman will fix it all.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:49.240
Just Paula McBeth.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.240
Yeah.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:51.240
Thank you.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.240
Hi, what's up?

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.240
Hi, what's up?

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.240
Hi, what's up?

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.240
Hi, what's up?

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.240
Hi, how's it going?

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.240
Good, good, good.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.240
Good.

01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.240
We're going to go quicker because we've got like five minutes left.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.240
I'll blow through this.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.240
Hit me.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:05.440
So I was at a comedy club the other night, and I went to get some beers from the bar,

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.040
and I paid with a 20, got two beers, and I got like $16 in change back.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.040
Damn.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.040
Whoa.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.040
All right.

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.040
Where were you?

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.040
1860?

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.040
It wasn't good.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.040
Okay.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.040
Oh, the beer was bad?

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.040
Yeah.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.040
Wait, but it was $2 beer, man.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.040
Like, what do you want?

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.040
Yeah, that's your fault.

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.040
Anyway.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:25.280
So I got the two beers in one hand, and then I get my change back in the other, and I'm

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:28.200
trying to put two ones into the tip jar.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.200
Uh-oh.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.760
But I drop all of my money.

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.760
Yeah.

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.760
Fuck.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:37.800
Thank you for doing this for me.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.720
Yeah, so then I-

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:44.160
You've given me such an enormous gift.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.160
So then I reach my hand in the tip jar.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.160
Yeah, you did.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.160
Oh, hell yeah.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.160
Of course you did.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.160
Yeah, you fucking Seinfeld motherfucker.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.160
Sure you did.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160
I love it.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:56.840
Let's reenact my favorite Will and Grace plot next.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:57.840
I love this.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:02.280
I only wanted, like, my 10 back, so I come out with two ones.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.280
You're done.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.280
You're done.

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.280
You're done.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.280
You're done.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.280
You're done.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.280
You're done.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.280
You lost the grand prize game.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.280
You got out, right?

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.280
You stopped at that point, right?

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.280
Oh, no.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.280
Okay, hold on.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.280
No.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.280
The bartender looks at me.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.280
Oh, no.

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:17.280
Yeah.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.280
And he asks what I'm doing.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:22.040
I'm making change for my 16, and then you walk out.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.160
And I struggled for an explanation and just dropped the two ones back in the tip jar.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.160
Listen.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.200
Understand that that was-

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.200
I want you to feel-

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.840
There's no advice we can give you.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.680
We can just tell you, you did the right thing.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:38.880
You made a $16 mistake, and there's no way to fix it.

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.960
It could have been a $14 mistake if you had just said two magic words, rubble, rubble,

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.600
and then run out.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.600
Yeah.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.600
Bartenders love thieves.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:52.360
No, you did right.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.360
I don't know what you want me to tell you.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.360
No, you didn't because you went back in.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.360
I'm sorry.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:02.560
You should have dropped the $16 and been like, ah, goddammit, and then walked away.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.640
You may as well have dropped them down a fucking sewer drain.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.640
Like they're gone.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:10.280
You could have dropped that $16 and then gone back to that bar for the next two weeks in

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:14.880
a row and not tipped, and just known in your heart you're fine.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.880
You paid it backwards.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:20.760
You spent $4 on beer, a $16 tip makes you the most generous man in the world.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:23.680
He tipped more than 100%.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:28.080
The only shame is that you weren't like raising your eyebrows at them as you put it in, huh?

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:31.600
That's actually the time where you get to look at it and go, next time when I say, do

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:35.280
you know who I am, remember that this is who I am.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:40.120
I want you to remember this moment when I ask that question in the future.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.120
Have you been back to the bar since?

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.120
No, not yet.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.280
Again, good call.

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.600
You've made the right decision.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:50.440
Even though you did the wrong thing by going back in there, because that's a violation

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:56.440
of the tips space, if you do that because you want to correct your error and the bartender

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:57.880
says, what are you doing?

01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:58.880
Just tell them.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.880
Yeah.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.880
I dropped my money in there.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:01.880
They are also humans.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:02.880
No, I'm sorry.

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.600
If I'm a bartender and you said, I dropped my money in there, I say, that's how it fucking

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.600
works.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.600
True.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.600
True.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.600
True.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.600
True.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.600
True.

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:20.360
Now it's across the magic threshold of the jug and then it became my money.

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:21.360
You're right.

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.360
Are we done?

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.360
You know what you should do?

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:24.360
You should cut your hand off.

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.360
Yeah.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.360
All right.

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:27.360
Perfect.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.360
What are you doing?

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:29.360
You're right.

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.360
One more.

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.360
We got one more.

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.360
Sorry.

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.360
Sorry, everybody else in line.

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.360
This is it.

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:35.360
Hi.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.360
Hi, I'm Jessie.

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360
Hi, Jessie.

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.360
So I have a five month old kitten.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:42.560
When he was one month old, my mom trained him to drink only out of cups.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.560
Oh, hell yeah.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:44.560
And mugs.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:50.560
So now he's five months old and I still give him a bowl of water every day, but it just

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.560
gets dirty.

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:58.600
So I leave him mugs, but then when I pour myself a mug of like milk or wine, he tries

01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.600
to drink it.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.600
Yeah.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.760
What do I do?

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:03.760
Enjoy that drunk cat.

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:08.040
Yeah, you've got a good thing going.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:13.520
It is, listen, a cat's job is to retrain you.

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:19.440
We have on our end table a cup for our cat that is always there.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:24.280
And we always have to explain to our friends, that's the cat's cup.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:32.240
And then one time a friend saw the cup and went, I'm parched and took a sippy sip.

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.480
And then I could never talk to them again.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.600
Did he take a sip by leaning over and licking at him?

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.440
You had another human being in your house who said, a glass of water I did not pour

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.440
for myself.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.440
They also had a similarly sized glass.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:49.760
It was a classic parent trap mix up.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:55.000
This is true because I also have a cat who has strange water drinking habits.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.920
You can read all about it in my comic Garfield.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:05.080
And every time anyone cats it's for me, it is basically a 45 minute monologue on why

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:10.480
you shouldn't fuck up my cat schedule of like, she'll drink out of that.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.760
Don't touch it.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:18.680
She drinks out of my dog's water bowl and my dog has just learned not to, not to, just

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.680
not to worry about it.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.040
Do you, do you love that kitty though?

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.040
Yes.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.040
Just let him.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.040
It's fine.

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:35.920
You know, congratulations again to your mom for messing up your life one more way.

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:36.920
I want to do one more.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:37.920
One more question.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:38.920
I don't care.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:39.920
Thank you.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:40.920
Thank you.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:41.920
I'm sorry.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:42.920
Thank you.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:43.920
I'm sorry.

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:44.920
Hi.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:45.920
Thank you.

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:46.920
Thank you guys.

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:47.920
Sorry.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:48.920
The timer's at two seconds.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:49.920
Oh no, it's, oh no, it's coming up.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.920
Sorry.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:51.920
Go ahead.

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:52.920
My name's Alpha Tay.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:53.920
Hey, what's up?

01:11:53.920 --> 01:12:02.600
I had no idea that you guys even existed until she told me about you guys.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.600
Great.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.600
Just like the rest of Earth.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:08.440
And that is when they were conjured into existence.

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.440
Right.

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.440
Pretty much.

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:16.640
And, um, I just wanted to ask because Lin-Manuel was on earlier and I know that he sometimes

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:20.760
raps and he's a person of color, so he's kind of like a brother, so he's like a fourth brother

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:21.760
kind of.

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:22.760
Sure.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:23.760
Yeah.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:34.280
Would you like to battle rap him for the position of fourth brother or at least, or if not that,

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:36.640
at least for one of your books, John?

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.400
You can rap to be me.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:40.400
You can rap to be Travis.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.400
I'm getting pretty tired of it.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.800
It's gone eight years now.

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:43.800
Lin?

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:44.800
I don't know if he's still here.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:45.800
I think he left.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.800
Oh, you know what?

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.800
Battle rap Griffin.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:48.800
Hey.

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:49.800
Okay.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.800
Good night, everybody.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.800
Oh no, the clock has a big skull on it.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:52.800
No, no, no.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.440
I want to hear Griffin battle rap this gentleman.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.000
I'll just give this to you right now.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Yeah.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Okay.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Yes.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
You won a Pyrrhic victory against my brother in battle rapping, but hey, give it up anyway.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
He still won.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Griffin conceded right away.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Yeah.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Shout out.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Shout out to all the other black Mbem-Bem fans.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Yeah.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
What's up?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Thank you so much.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
All 15 of us.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:40.520
For the folks at home, Justin and I were literally knocked to the ground as if by a supersonic

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:41.520
force.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.520
Tactical blow.

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.920
They self-taekwondoed themselves to the ground.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.920
Thank you.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:47.920
Okay, everybody.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:48.920
Thank you so much.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.920
Thank you.

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:50.920
Enjoy.

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:51.920
Thank you.

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:52.920
Okay.

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.260
So I have to get through these real quick.

01:13:56.260 --> 01:14:01.740
Thank you first to John Hodgman.

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.960
Thank you to our dear friend Lin-Manuel Miranda.

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.960
Thank you, John.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.600
He's great.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.240
Thank you to Still Buffering for opening up for us.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:11.240
Thank you so much.

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.240
Yes.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.160
In case we didn't say it before, there are posters out in the lobby if you didn't grab

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.160
one.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.160
Poster.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:20.160
Yes.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.160
We signed some of them.

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.160
We did our best.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.160
We did our best.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.160
Thank you to Paul and Sam.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.160
Thank you, Paul, for helping us out.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.160
Thank you, Paul.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.160
Thank you, Sam.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.160
Thank you, everybody, to AG.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.160
Thank you, everybody, to this fucking beautiful theater you have.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.160
This is the craziest theater I've ever been in my entire life.

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:37.080
Thank you for making it all the way out to Brooklyn.

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:41.640
I didn't know that was a thing until New York people told me.

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:45.640
We should also make it clear, unfortunately, we're not going to be able to do a meet and

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:46.640
greet.

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:49.440
We try to hang out after the shows, but we have an early-ass train tomorrow, and we have

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.520
an hour to get back to our hotel because we're in the middle of Brooklyn, so we're probably

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:53.520
just going to bounce.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.520
Yeah.

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:55.520
Sorry about that.

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:56.520
Thank you for coming.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.520
We really appreciate you.

01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:58.520
We tried to say hey to some folks before the show.

01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.520
Yeah.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.520
We came by and said hi.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:07.040
Sincerely, this has been, like, so wild, and there's so many of you.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.040
This is our biggest show ever, and thank you.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.040
Thank you so much.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:18.000
Also, we should say, along with thanking John, Vacationland is coming out.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
When, John?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
October 24th, 2017.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Hell yeah.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Catch it.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.440
This is not a joke.

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:29.800
If I can spend one second saying we grew up listening to John Hodgman's books when we

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.240
went on our family vacations, I remember listening to—

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.720
I'm extremely old.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:40.840
We listen to more information than you require going to Nashville with our dad.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:41.840
Pigeon Forge, remember?

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:42.840
Yeah, Pigeon Forge.

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.840
Pigeon Forge, too.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.640
And so it's really cool that he was here tonight.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:47.640
Yeah.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.640
Thank you, John.

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:49.640
Thank you, guys.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.280
If you have never listened or read any of his books before, you should get on vacation

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.280
with him.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.280
Yeah, he's a genius.

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.280
Very kind.

01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:02.760
I am an only child, so I envy you guys, your siblinghood quite a bit, and I am glad to

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:03.760
be here with you.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:08.320
Well, you just have to battle rap Lin, and then you can be our fourth brother.

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.440
That is going to do it for us, Griffin.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.440
You have one final question for us.

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.440
I sure do.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:13.880
Well, let's pick it.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:18.960
Every week, Griffin picks a Yahoo, and then we come back to it next week and talk about

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.960
it.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.960
This one was sent in by Level 9000.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:29.400
Not true, true, Drew Davenport, thank you, Drew.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:34.840
This was asked by Yahoo Answers user Captain, who asks, mad because my life sucks compared

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:39.840
to Seth Rogen and Seth MacFarlane.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:42.200
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.200
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.200
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:47.840
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

01:16:47.840 --> 01:17:17.320
It's your dad, Square on the Lips.

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:25.400
Hey, you, with the headphones.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:29.000
Just between you and me, the MaxFunStore just got some of that sweet, sweet new merchant

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
stock.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.200
You know, that merch from your favorite MaxFun shows?

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:36.240
Could be posters, tote bags, shirts, stickers, patches, aprons.

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.240
We got it all.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.240
Well, we got a lot.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.400
Point is, there's some new stuff.
