WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:22.080
Like Chilean miners emerging from the depths to a triumphant round of applause to my brother

00:22.080 --> 00:25.680
my brother me and invite you for the modern era I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

00:25.680 --> 00:36.080
I'm your middle is brother Travis McElroy I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

00:36.080 --> 00:43.800
they probably they probably applauded like a lot when those miners got out

00:43.800 --> 00:49.480
yeah I'm not sure you guys Christ sack up to that which if you're in that audience how do

00:49.480 --> 00:55.720
you know like when to stop applauding like do you think by like the 33rd one how many were there

00:55.720 --> 01:00.000
that's an excellent question Griffin because there is like there's a moment where everybody's

01:00.000 --> 01:05.840
like losing it right because they're like oh the first guy is the first guy is like yes and then

01:05.840 --> 01:13.920
probably about a minor 20 they're like okay but then like 21 comes up holding a puppy and you're

01:13.920 --> 01:19.600
like yeah and then 29 is like I think we're almost done guys let's bring this one home but

01:19.600 --> 01:24.600
then after they were all out there had to be a moment at the end of the chair one for everybody

01:24.600 --> 01:33.320
yeah for us we are some snacks where they were like well bye bye I guess go now do something

01:33.320 --> 01:40.320
else like honestly I mean you're still miners you gotta go back to work in the mines like you

01:40.320 --> 01:47.360
don't have another tomorrow tomorrow I guess not that we're still milking the miners back

01:47.360 --> 01:56.120
yeah and the miners I am already the most sweaty that's comedy ain't easy wash it what I love

01:56.120 --> 02:00.840
Washington DC I love it I love being in the D anytime I get a chance all this government

02:00.840 --> 02:08.240
anytime I get to visit the DS I'm psyched about it you guys have an invisible barrier of just a

02:08.240 --> 02:16.640
rich invisible fog of humidity that exists here it's like at this off the sea level and it's just

02:16.640 --> 02:29.680
perfectly my underwear height and now I'm sitting it's face high time about your foggy bottoms it's

02:29.680 --> 02:36.160
a local reverence I saw it on one of the subway platforms I'm saying it's something of a comfort

02:36.160 --> 02:41.400
to me cuz like I watch TV and I see politicians on TV I think they're so powerful I see like

02:41.400 --> 02:48.720
Mitch McConnell up there like women shouldn't have library cards and it's like and like everybody's

02:48.720 --> 02:54.480
losing their minds like yeah yeah yeah but then like he walks off stage he's like my gooch is

02:54.480 --> 03:00.000
ruined like I know as soon as they go in the back room it's like you're not so powerful anymore

03:00.000 --> 03:08.240
cuz you're like oh my grindle is soupy like so much baby powder Kevin Spacey mommy Kevin Spacey

03:08.240 --> 03:14.640
like walks off the set he's like Clio that was great work my under my gold goose is souped it's

03:14.640 --> 03:25.800
so bad bring me some more of my acting trunks and I don't know well can Kevin Spacey pretending to

03:25.800 --> 03:31.040
be I don't know why he's still in character when he's not playing Frank Drebben or whatever because

03:31.040 --> 03:37.760
he is a method method he is method Justin whether he's hot or not he's got a soupy goose and that

03:37.760 --> 03:47.920
is just true we do now we talk more about Kevin Spacey's taint before we get into the questions

03:47.920 --> 03:53.600
and we got we got a lot of fun stuff playing for you this is the usual stuff but it'll be fun we

03:53.600 --> 03:59.760
were leaving our names yeah we did that part we did that part who this is still the charming

03:59.760 --> 04:05.480
intro there by license before the question okay we were we were leaving a restaurant last night

04:05.480 --> 04:10.240

04:10.240 --> 04:15.000
photographic evidence we leave you a place called Asia 54 I don't know if you've been but highly

04:15.000 --> 04:21.240
recommended pretty good it's great what's great we saw Rob Reiner not there not there at our hotel

04:21.240 --> 04:26.760
ninety eight point five nine eight point five percent Rob Reiner anyway hold on it was either

04:26.760 --> 04:31.120
a hundred percent Rob Reiner was zero percent Rob Reiner it was not one of his failed clones

04:31.120 --> 04:45.520
okay it was not club Reiner you mean Carl Reiner nobody's nobody's quite sure so we're leaving a

04:45.520 --> 04:52.480
lot of clones have the Jack disease or we're leaving the restaurant and as we are leaving

04:52.480 --> 05:00.240
this guy jumps in front of us and says be careful there's a raccoon in this tree now I'm listen I

05:00.240 --> 05:05.040
may be from West Virginia but I've been to a big city before I know how this ends pal this ends with

you try and hit me up for cash right so my okay so I walk past him I love not exaggerating by the

05:11.280 --> 05:17.840
way that is literally how he reacted yeah sure sure pal well there's a fucking raccoon in the

05:17.840 --> 05:23.120
tree and before we continue on with this you need to understand I want to paint a picture for you

05:23.120 --> 05:30.520
there's not much more but this raccoon looked terrified care this was not a taunting villain

05:30.520 --> 05:35.200
of a raccoon this look if you had told me that raccoon was nine months old I believe yeah the

05:35.200 --> 05:39.560

there dumbstruck he said this raccoon was chasing me down the street and then he this raccoon was

05:47.080 --> 05:53.640
chasing me on the street and then he ran up this tree so now I'm waiting for him to come down to

07:14.920 --> 07:20.200
his adulthood to begin going by his middle name while I have no problem with this choice in his

07:20.200 --> 07:24.160
personal and professional life I am torn as to how I should now address him he insists that he

07:24.160 --> 07:28.160
does not care one way or the other should I continue to use his first name or attempt to

07:28.160 --> 07:33.720
break 29 years of conditioning to use the new moniker that's from doubtful designator in DC

07:33.720 --> 07:45.560
that would be are you here wait you here like eight different people right yeah how many y'all

07:45.560 --> 07:52.520
got younger brothers who just changed their name is this a rampant okay I need everybody to be

07:52.520 --> 07:56.520
quiet because I don't want to muddy the result I need to know the first name in the middle name

07:56.520 --> 08:03.760
his name okay okay and what's that wait oh I was about to ask last name it was gonna incriminate

08:03.760 --> 08:15.080

room that we don't get once again just the question asker yes or no question was this done

09:07.640 --> 09:13.000

09:20.840 --> 09:33.040

start doing juggalo mating calls my friend who is not a juggalo says that if cops pull us over

13:24.200 --> 13:28.880

along I go go go for Faygo you know secret handshake that they have I don't they won't I

14:04.480 --> 14:10.440
don't know their secret handshake I think the answer is like definitely yes like if I was a

14:10.440 --> 14:17.440
cop and like I saw like if I saw some of this iconography I would be like I think I'd like to

14:17.440 --> 14:24.120
see what's inside your car maybe this is a reasonable search and seizure because I really

14:24.120 --> 14:28.680
would like to see what's in there maybe they just want to see what it's like from their point of

14:28.680 --> 14:34.000
view like I just want to live in your shoes for a minute how's it going it's like a hieroglyphic

14:34.000 --> 14:42.760
the hatchet man is but and it translates to roughly I love drugs and murder and murder drugs

14:42.760 --> 14:55.640
I love murder drugs drugs that get me like crazy to murder do you mind if I just in your car to

14:55.640 --> 14:59.240
see how things go over there what I love about this is the other side of this is that there's

14:59.240 --> 15:04.000
definitely an orientation day where some chief of police says people that goes if you see this

15:04.000 --> 15:10.440
hatchet man you will ask to search the car if they say whoop whoop in any form or fashion we

15:10.440 --> 15:15.920
don't know the pronunciation you will ask to see their trunk now if it's just a bumper sticker with

15:15.920 --> 15:28.020
Sideshow Bob in it you fucked up you lose your badge for that shit whoop whoop how about how

15:28.020 --> 15:34.480
about another question just yeah hold on activate the iPad oh lock screen should have turned that

15:34.480 --> 15:41.720
off he had a screen saver up our friend believes she has a life-threatening nut allergy but has

15:41.720 --> 15:49.520
never been tested everywhere she goes she refuses to eat anything that may have any type of nut in

15:49.520 --> 15:54.680
it however all of her friends think it's just in her head how do we get her tested so we think

15:54.680 --> 16:02.000
we all know for sure if she's allergic or not Jesus that's from going nuts for sure and Gabby

16:02.000 --> 16:11.520
hold on y'all here what is your day-to-day relationship with this friend where you're

16:11.520 --> 16:22.600
like hey this done they're like no and you're like I'll get you one of these days she doesn't

16:22.600 --> 16:29.880
want to eat nuts it's cool yeah your options are get her to eat a nut or like put up like

16:29.880 --> 16:34.960
a put her in a big bag and like carry her to the hospital where they do the nut test like

16:34.960 --> 16:43.400
those are the that's it I'm gonna I'm gonna lean away from the get her to eat a nut one I'm gonna

16:43.400 --> 16:51.040
lean away from the big bad one they're both shitty they're like one of these days you're

16:51.040 --> 16:56.720
gonna keep pushing it and pushing it and she she's just gonna say god damn it I don't like nuts okay

16:56.720 --> 17:00.360
and that's shorter to just say I'm allergic because I don't know because then everybody's

17:00.360 --> 17:04.040
gonna be like what about macadamia yeah I don't like those either I don't like any nuts I don't

17:04.040 --> 17:09.920
like the concept of nuts I don't like any nuts I'm not a fan it's only nuts nut allergies are no

17:09.920 --> 17:16.080
joke well they're not they're super not unless I think maybe it's fake and then I think we can

17:16.080 --> 17:20.600
make jokes out of it but maybe it's not fake if you don't want us to make jokes about it get

17:20.600 --> 17:26.240
the test that's the thing then we owe you an apology what is your friend basing it off of if

17:26.240 --> 17:33.080
not a test I'm just like I look at a nut and I just get a bad feeling okay but flip side what's

17:33.080 --> 17:38.600
everybody else basing it off of where they're like I saw her eat a Snickers one time I was swears

17:38.600 --> 17:44.120
so rapper was gone she said it was a Milky Way I don't fucking believe it she threw the rapper

17:44.120 --> 17:49.840
away she's just eating a big log I saw Snickers it could have been a Mounds but I'm pretty sure it was an Almond Joy

17:49.840 --> 17:57.840
is your friend here oh shit

17:57.840 --> 18:19.400
hey hey wait did you just call us here for nut allergy intervention we love you so much Debbie

18:19.400 --> 18:32.320
eat a fucking peanut hey but listen no don't no wait no wait we're on a high-energy show here and

18:32.320 --> 18:41.680
there's probably nuts in the lobby and oh tonight's the night tonight's the night time to dance with

18:41.680 --> 18:50.920
don't eat that nut it's two to one majority rules I can't go to jail I don't eat the nut

18:50.920 --> 19:00.360
let's talk about email composition to a podcast show what are you talking about your friends

19:00.360 --> 19:07.800
imaginary nut allergy potentially imaginary because the phrase who will also be in attendance

19:07.800 --> 19:24.080
would be fucking rad sadly absent it's too late for this one but if you're coming to if you're

19:24.080 --> 19:29.840
coming to New York tomorrow you're like this guy does he's not gluten intolerant he'll be there

19:29.840 --> 19:40.200
though put that second part in cuz like the material party with the most information here

19:40.200 --> 19:44.280
it's a person who thinks they'll eat a nut and die they probably know more about this situation

19:44.280 --> 19:57.960
than you do so sorry do what we're doing our best up here okay as long as we're sharing things so

19:57.960 --> 20:04.840
we're recording here live at the we're recording live at the Lincoln Theatre here in Washington DC

20:04.840 --> 20:18.680
and it's been alright RIP what RIP somebody asked didn't somebody one of our Lyft drivers

20:18.680 --> 20:23.880
and it wasn't ours ours was cool ours was it Dwight's Dwight your Lyft driver hey everybody

20:23.880 --> 20:32.840
it's my friend Dwight Slappy sitting exactly where Lincoln was sitting yeah yeah co-hosting

20:32.840 --> 20:36.520
things about sheets Dwight real quick when you told your Lyft driver you want to go to

20:36.520 --> 20:45.960
the Lincoln Theatre what'd your Lyft driver say no no he was not shot here that would have been

20:45.960 --> 20:56.480
ironic I think oh man in my own dang theater beans our Lyft driver I'm we're telling Lyft

20:56.480 --> 21:02.040
driver stories now to keep Travis from telling his fucking sad lip I will our Lyft driver was

21:02.040 --> 21:06.480
awesome he was so so great but at some point him and Travis got in this like really deep

21:06.480 --> 21:11.680
conversation about like homeless populations in urban centers and it was like no it was great

21:11.680 --> 21:18.320
is you know it was cool idea I was like I was trying to break it up and he was going having

21:18.320 --> 21:24.920
a really nice conversation one thing though his GPS the voice for his GPS it was T-Pain

21:24.920 --> 21:37.240
so try to be like oh man skid row like it was horrible like there's just no respect for I wish

21:37.240 --> 21:41.200
every time that happened trust is like but then the dude would have been like they would just go

21:41.200 --> 21:50.560
into the woods and get up it was bad it was a bad juxtaposition hi everybody thanks for

21:50.560 --> 21:55.840
listening to our Washington DC live episode and thank you Washington DC for coming out and making

21:55.840 --> 22:02.680
us feel just just so wet and wild and thank you vice president Joe Biden for standing back in the

22:02.680 --> 22:08.160
shadows and vice president Joe Biden I appreciate the fact you realized this was our night not your

that this is my first time Olive Garden is doubling its offering of breadstick sandwiches

36:19.240 --> 36:24.240
and bringing new twist to an Italian classic cuz after you have breadstick sandwiches you're like

36:24.240 --> 36:29.920
this is good I wish there were twice as many to choose from cuz it wasn't already hard enough

36:29.920 --> 36:37.440
to choose I need you to start from the fucking beginning and explain to me what a bread is it

36:37.440 --> 36:44.280
just a little just a tiny just a little like little guy sandwich pipe that you just fucking

36:44.280 --> 36:54.240

36:58.080 --> 37:03.720

37:03.720 --> 37:22.120

they're also offering brand-new deep dish spaghetti pies it looks exactly how you think it would like

38:02.160 --> 38:08.480
a big piece of angel fruit cake made out of spaghetti and frosting cheese so listen and

38:08.480 --> 38:15.800
frosting cheese last summer America fell in love with the breadstick sandwiches when they

38:15.800 --> 38:23.120
were debuted at Olive Garden restaurants and on food trucks touring the country we gotta

38:23.120 --> 38:28.720
get this to the people you can't contain this in an Olive Garden these breadstick sandwiches

38:28.720 --> 38:35.480

38:35.480 --> 38:39.200
nation to give fans the opportunity to gather together and sample the new menu items sounds

38:39.200 --> 38:47.200
like a cool afternoon it kicked off in New York City where I'm sure did great the way

38:47.200 --> 38:53.360
you're sitting right now makes it look like you just ate a deep dish spaghetti pie I got

chicken breadstick sandwich and eggplant parmesan breadstick sandwich that's not pretty good

39:03.840 --> 39:09.240
anyway here's the quote and this is what the munch squad is really all about it's about

39:09.240 --> 39:15.320
taking the words of the experts who create food and getting their opinions about scooping

39:15.320 --> 39:25.720

41:03.360 --> 41:10.640
a ramekin of minestrone and a jam it like a shooter so when they asked him who I was

41:10.640 --> 41:15.520

by Yahoo answers user Simon who asks if you had to wear a picture of food on all your

42:13.680 --> 42:17.920
spaghetti pie yeah spaghetti pie sure so let's take those off let's take those off the table

42:17.920 --> 42:22.080

Peter my Yahoo Answers username is Equus Princess oh that's a beautiful beautiful shirt I need

47:26.200 --> 47:30.960
him to be removed no what's up how can we help yeah so I lived in Philly for a long

47:30.960 --> 47:41.520
time and my nice yeah okay kind of rude so my German Shepherd kept finding what appeared

47:41.520 --> 47:49.720
to be human bones in our yard let him finish sorry I'm gonna say let him finish this is

47:49.720 --> 47:53.160
really important can you get can you just eat that you're a tall man get in there just

47:53.160 --> 47:58.600
eat that man yeah so so she seemed to be finding what appeared to be human bones that were

47:58.600 --> 48:02.520
potentially confirmed by my sister-in-law who's a doctor yeah looks like rib bones

48:02.520 --> 48:09.800
or something and a murderer no it's just and and then and my uncle we moved to DC and

48:09.800 --> 48:16.560
it stopped okay and then just a few days ago my wife was home with the dogs and the dog

48:16.560 --> 48:23.560
found one rib bone and then was it a different location later or a couple right and the next

48:23.560 --> 48:30.920
day there was an another bone that that showed up is your dog killing the people that's the

48:30.920 --> 48:36.120
only thing that makes sense yeah it doesn't make sense your dog David fucking Caruso

48:36.120 --> 48:43.580
like well so so here's here's the case I dig it the thing that the thing that I'm concerned

48:43.580 --> 48:49.600
about is we just got back from Seattle and we get more monitor on us from the crowd mics

48:49.600 --> 48:54.240

48:54.240 --> 48:59.440
Seattle my wife and I okay and we took a small side trip to Lake Sammamish okay where's that

48:59.440 --> 49:06.920
that's where Ted Bundy abducted a bunch of people and and that was that that was at my

49:06.920 --> 49:18.820
wife's request okay and then the bones wait is this a cry for help do you need to come

49:18.820 --> 49:25.560
up here with us there's so many parts of this episode that are gonna be in like a courtroom

49:25.560 --> 49:33.960
somewhere so so am I good yeah you're great okay you totally what could possibly happen

49:33.960 --> 49:38.560
it's gonna be like okay I do I do have a question that I have to have it answered when you're

49:38.560 --> 49:47.040
done with them do you when you're done with them do you just throw the human bones in

49:47.040 --> 49:56.640
the garbage well what would you suggest call the police yeah I would run some tests at

49:56.640 --> 50:04.120
the lab say that say I actually am a scientist I work for the NIH so I could probably do

50:04.120 --> 50:19.400
that all right all right the nuclear Institute yeah why are you asking us about what to do

50:19.400 --> 50:31.000

hi Becky hi Becky um I it is not a bummer I just wanted to clarify um that's what people

51:53.160 --> 52:00.360
say when the first half is it's not it's not okay um so I uh I have a painting uh and it's

52:00.360 --> 52:04.520
not haunted or anything it's just a painting that was my first fuck who's the who's the

52:04.520 --> 52:10.720
painting getting older I have a I have a doll that's also haunted um no I have a painting

52:10.720 --> 52:16.920
the problem is that it is a painting of me um it was done by my my brother-in-law I know

52:16.920 --> 52:20.160
it's great it's great to have a painting I was like four years old just a super cute

52:20.160 --> 52:26.340
you know just a painting of my head region um you know so it's just this like painting

52:26.340 --> 52:30.860
this like you know bust painting of four year old and I was like super cute oh you're four

52:30.860 --> 52:35.440
I am currently four I'm no in the painting you were four yes yes I think we've established

52:35.440 --> 52:42.840
there's a painting of you yeah and and I kind of don't know what to do with it yeah for

52:42.840 --> 52:50.880
sure no totally right there with you dog super yes because like I feel like if I were living

52:50.880 --> 52:54.400
you know I'm living on my own for the first time I feel like if I was living with like

52:54.400 --> 52:58.040
you know husband and kids it could be like up there with the family portraits or whatever

52:58.040 --> 53:03.360
but I'm just in an apartment no yes by myself I don't know that I'm gonna have any advice

53:03.360 --> 53:10.240
you I'm just like yeah dog that's rough like what you've got is what we call a showpiece

53:10.240 --> 53:15.440
ah and what that means is when someone visits you the first time you have to take them into

53:15.440 --> 53:22.080
a room that's completely empty except for a painting on the wall where you just stand

53:22.080 --> 53:27.680
in front of it and go one day I'll get back there I think you're overestimating my my

53:27.680 --> 53:35.880
rent budget where I can just have spare room sleep in your bathroom ah that's the solution

53:35.880 --> 53:39.680
can you put the painting in the bathroom oh like on the toilet like I have to confront

53:39.680 --> 53:47.000
it before they little speech balloon it just isn't nice I feel like that's that's disrespectful

53:47.000 --> 53:51.060
to the painting like my brother-in-law did it it's a nice painting he did it was nice

53:51.060 --> 53:57.360
of him it was a oh my god is he alive see so yes okay he's get him to well I don't want

53:57.360 --> 54:03.360
because I got you okay preemptive get him to paint another one on the same picture of

54:03.360 --> 54:12.080
you behind you like today looking on like so proud you're like oh look I did it recursive

54:12.080 --> 54:19.520
paintings of myself forever I think you have to have a party where you unveil it to everybody

54:19.520 --> 54:24.920
and then who first of all whoever sticks around that's your real friends but I'm thinking

54:24.920 --> 54:30.920
about it now and like fuck dude if I had something like this in like my first place where I was

54:30.920 --> 54:34.440
living by myself and it was like let's go over to Griffin's place and hang out with

54:34.440 --> 54:41.360
this weird painting that's fun like that you could if you can own it's a hard needle holy

54:41.360 --> 54:47.280
shit cuz like if it goes if you miss the needle hole then you're fucking Kathy Bates in misery

54:47.280 --> 54:52.400
or something but if you can get it right in there then you've got like the dopest prop

54:52.400 --> 54:59.880
comedy like literally ever here's the phrase you have to practice oh that get the delivery

54:59.880 --> 55:03.960
of those two words down and you're gonna miss but then you have like a holiday party at

55:03.960 --> 55:08.000
your place you have like a holiday party and you put like a little Santa hat cut out on

55:08.000 --> 55:12.280

56:59.640 --> 57:07.840
are dancing lessons from God maybe you need maybe this is a sign you know like maybe it's

57:07.840 --> 57:12.640
time for you to really take stock and say like I like that because maybe the family

57:12.640 --> 57:17.400

your name Emma Emma okay okay so I live in a really big apartment building and there's

59:59.640 --> 01:00:06.320
sort of a hallway there's a hallway and there's just me and one other person at the end of

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:11.640
this hallway okay and it's a old apartment building lots of policies we're not allowed

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:21.200
to have pets okay my neighbor has a secret dog oh shit I've heard it I've seen it I've

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:46.760
like the size of a breadbox yeah they have a rectangular dog quiet relatively quiet at

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:53.540
night yes during the day especially when I'm coming in and out for work not really how

01:00:53.540 --> 01:01:08.240
absolute is your sense of justice judge dread
