WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:46.240
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

00:46.240 --> 00:50.000
me and advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.880
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.880
Hey, this is your baby brother, Griffin McElroy, 30 under 30.

00:56.880 --> 01:02.400
Oh man, I hope I make the cut. I'm really worried about downsizing here at My Brother,

01:02.400 --> 01:07.360
My Brother, Me, and I'm really afraid that when it comes down to it, if we don't hit our goals,

01:07.360 --> 01:11.200
if we don't make budget this year, I think the middle-est is the first to go, because

01:11.920 --> 01:13.200
what do I even do?

01:13.200 --> 01:16.560
Well, we're going more peer-to-peer, and the peers are me and Justin,

01:16.560 --> 01:20.000
and so we don't need an intermediary.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I'm literally the middle man.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.920
Yeah, you know how on the show I'll do a joke, and then you'll say it,

01:25.920 --> 01:29.120
and then Justin will laugh at it, and then sometimes it goes the other way?

01:29.120 --> 01:29.680
I know.

01:29.680 --> 01:33.680
I've been thinking maybe instead of the three of us being on

01:33.680 --> 01:38.160
two two-way calls with you, Travis, me and Justin could just fucking call each other.

01:38.160 --> 01:43.680
Whoa, but hey, if you do that, then what would I do?

01:45.200 --> 01:48.880
So anyway, this little skit is something that we came up with at Bible Study,

01:48.880 --> 01:55.120
and we wanted to do it on you so that you would know the real-life stakes of the Max Fun Drive

01:55.120 --> 01:57.120
2019 week two edition.

01:57.120 --> 01:57.680
That's right.

01:57.680 --> 02:02.000
If we don't hit 25,000 new and upgrading donors, I'm out.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.480
I'm out on the street.

02:04.480 --> 02:08.160
I am really excited to welcome a new edition to the soundboard.

02:09.600 --> 02:15.040
Yeah, as you know, the soundboard, as it stands now, here's a quick update.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.000
It's got this music.

02:17.440 --> 02:18.880
Is that a good volume for you?

02:18.880 --> 02:21.120
I mean, no volume's a good volume on the soundboard.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.920
Okay, but here's the new one.

02:23.920 --> 02:24.720
Are you ready?

02:24.720 --> 02:29.600
And this is to remind people, every time you hear this, I want to create a Pavlovian response

02:29.600 --> 02:34.240
that every time you hear this sound, it makes you go to Maximumfun.org forward slash donate

02:34.240 --> 02:38.240
and increase your support of the Maximum Fun Network, specifically the shows that we make.

02:38.240 --> 02:38.720
Here it comes.

02:38.720 --> 02:39.920
Every time?

02:39.920 --> 02:40.640
Every single time.

02:40.640 --> 02:41.140
You ready?

02:42.160 --> 02:46.480
I think, Travis, once you hear this new soundboard edition,

02:46.480 --> 02:50.720
I feel like you are going to retract your incredulity.

02:50.720 --> 02:51.680
Is this the sound?

02:51.680 --> 02:52.640
Was that it?

02:52.640 --> 02:53.360
No, that wasn't it.

02:53.360 --> 02:53.760
Here it comes.

02:53.760 --> 02:54.880
Ready?

02:54.880 --> 02:55.600
Get that money.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.000
One more time?

02:58.000 --> 02:58.640
One more time?

02:58.640 --> 02:59.840
One more time, I guess.

02:59.840 --> 03:00.720
One more, wait, what?

03:00.720 --> 03:02.880
Yeah, give me some volume, give me some gain on that.

03:02.880 --> 03:03.680
Okay, here it comes.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.880
Get that money.

03:06.880 --> 03:07.360
One more time?

03:07.360 --> 03:08.240
Just one more time?

03:08.240 --> 03:09.360
Get that money.

03:10.400 --> 03:15.040
Now, Justin, could you, and I'm horrified to ask this, use it in a sentence?

03:15.600 --> 03:16.100
Sure.

03:17.440 --> 03:20.400
Travis will be forced to leave that show if we don't.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.600
Get that money.

03:22.880 --> 03:23.520
Okay.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.760
So who did you get to do the word money?

03:25.760 --> 03:27.760
I actually got Brad, I got Brad Garrett.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.280
Wow.

03:29.280 --> 03:29.760
Yeah.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.440
Can you make him say something else?

03:31.440 --> 03:31.940
Sure.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.560
Do that now?

03:36.560 --> 03:37.280
Do that right now?

03:37.280 --> 03:37.680
Now?

03:37.680 --> 03:38.240
Now, please.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.880
He can't, he's, no, listen, I can't afford to-

03:42.880 --> 03:43.680
Toronto!

03:43.680 --> 03:45.040
Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

03:45.040 --> 03:45.680
I can't afford-

03:45.680 --> 03:46.880
Is that Brad Garrett?

03:46.880 --> 03:47.280
What?

03:47.280 --> 03:52.000
Is that Brad Garrett decided to be at Toronto doing an impression of Kiss?

03:52.000 --> 03:52.320
Yes.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.760
Paul Stanley?

03:53.760 --> 03:58.800
Can you, can we do a stretch goal where if we hit 30,000 new and upgrading donors for

03:58.800 --> 04:05.120
the maximum fund drive, I want to get four big men to stand on the sound board with all

04:05.120 --> 04:07.920
of their weight and see what happens after that.

04:07.920 --> 04:12.720
I cannot state my disdain for this new feature loudly or enthusiastically.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.760
It would probably sound, it would probably sound a little something like this.

04:15.760 --> 04:18.080
Oh, God, no, oh, God, no.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.680
Oh, Jesus Christ.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.440
There's something like this.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.880
Well, goodbye, everybody.

04:23.600 --> 04:27.760
Anyway, maximumfund.org forward slash donate is the address.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.840
We are trying to get 25,000 new and upgrading donors.

04:30.400 --> 04:35.840
Your support of the maximum fund network, around 75% of that goes directly to the shows

04:35.840 --> 04:39.920
that you say you listen to when you fill out the brief survey upon donating.

04:40.640 --> 04:44.000
The rest goes to help fund the great work at maximum fund.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.240
That includes doing this drive and the pledge gifts, which include at our $5 donor per month

04:50.240 --> 04:53.840
level, you get over 225 hours of bonus content.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.200
Did you run the math on that?

04:55.200 --> 05:01.840
It's like the best value in entertainment, I think, which includes us doing all manner

05:01.840 --> 05:02.480
of garbage.

05:02.480 --> 05:08.400
I mean, just like videos and weird stuff, other weird recordings.

05:08.400 --> 05:13.120
This year, our wives once again recorded an episode of my Slim Slam, my sister-in-law,

05:13.120 --> 05:13.840
my sister-in-law and me.

05:13.840 --> 05:19.120
There's a new episode commentary featuring us and JD Amato for episode three, I think,

05:19.120 --> 05:21.120
of the Brother, My Brother, Me TV show.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.360
The famous Travis does a hit episode.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.440
Yeah, if you want to hear all the dirty secrets behind that.

05:25.440 --> 05:29.840
Also, I did a toilet crime behind the scenes that episode that JD fully puts me on blast

05:29.840 --> 05:30.160
about.

05:30.160 --> 05:30.560
Oh, yeah.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.000
At the $10 a month level, you're going to get all that content, plus you're going to

05:34.000 --> 05:37.200
get to choose one of several fantastic pins.

05:38.240 --> 05:42.960
$20 a month, you get the pins, you get the bonus content, and you get a beautiful puzzle

05:42.960 --> 05:44.960
featuring the view outside the max fund offices.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.560
It is not about the gifts.

05:48.560 --> 05:49.200
Those are nice.

05:49.200 --> 05:53.520
It's about supporting content that you feel should be in the world.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.880
What do you want to see more of?

05:54.880 --> 06:00.160
Do you want to see more nasty superheroes battling it out?

06:01.200 --> 06:04.080
More of those raunchy, just sweaty.

06:04.080 --> 06:12.000
I see Shazam and his penis everywhere and the lightning bolt obviously pointing right

06:12.000 --> 06:14.640
down to his region.

06:15.360 --> 06:16.320
Oh, my God, Griffin.

06:16.320 --> 06:21.600
You have transitioned directly into, I think, a perfect opening for this week's episode

06:21.600 --> 06:23.120
of Brother, Brother, Brother, Me.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.480
It's a Shazam watch.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.560
Shazam watch.

06:26.560 --> 06:32.560
Shazam the movie is coming in April 5th.

06:32.560 --> 06:38.480
Now, it looks like there might be some sneak preview showings in the Huntington area looking

06:38.480 --> 06:40.720
at some early reconnaissance that I have here.

06:40.720 --> 06:47.600
I've already seen it, and let me tell you my favorite part of the movie is that every

06:47.600 --> 06:51.840
so often someone will be walking around with Shazam and a song will start playing on the

06:51.840 --> 06:55.200
radio overhead, and people will look at him and say, what's that song?

06:55.200 --> 06:59.120
And he has an encyclopedic knowledge of what the song is, and Shazam.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.480
Oh, man, Trav.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.840
You got to know that's a stinker.

07:01.840 --> 07:05.440
And this is the episode where he asks people for cash.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.680
Oh, I get it because it's like the app.

07:07.680 --> 07:08.800
Oh, boysy, Trav.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.360
And you're pot committed to the stinky joke at this point.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.440
No, because it's a real thing that happens in the movie.

07:13.440 --> 07:17.200
I know, but it's Zachary Levi is a boy who gets bigified into a superhero, and there's

07:17.200 --> 07:23.200
a lot to play with there, but you made an app pun like a teen dad.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.480
I sure did.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.760
Can we talk about the muscles?

07:26.320 --> 07:30.800
The muscles on the Zachary Levi costume of Shazam.

07:30.800 --> 07:38.400
Shazam is a story about a beautiful boy who's learning all about being a teen, and he transforms

07:38.400 --> 07:42.560
into Chuck sometimes with the power of lightning that he has harnessed.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.000
Well, when he eats a spicy food.

07:44.640 --> 07:50.880
When he eats a spicy food, he transforms into Chuck from the show Chuck, and he just gets

07:50.880 --> 07:54.080
crazy on it, and he is having so many fun adventures.

07:54.080 --> 07:58.320
And what I could tell from the previews, he also brings, even though he is now a superhero

07:58.320 --> 08:03.920
boy with invincibility and strength or whatever, brings a normal human boy with him into dangerous

08:03.920 --> 08:05.200
situations.

08:05.200 --> 08:10.480
Yes, as near as I can tell, he's bringing another young boy who's just learning about

08:10.480 --> 08:11.600
his teenage body.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.960
What do I have to eat to get a big adult body?

08:17.760 --> 08:21.440
Well, come with me to danger, I guess, where there's guns and stuff.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.640
Whoa, will your superpowers make me also invincible?

08:24.640 --> 08:26.080
I don't know.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.280
Maybe we'll find out.

08:27.280 --> 08:34.800
But whenever a criminal threatens Shazam, he uses his big adult Chuck body to kill them

08:34.800 --> 08:36.880
with his strength, and I love that.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.000
That's probably my favorite thing.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.760
It takes a dark turn.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.840
Never really deal with that, but Iron Man has killed a lot of people with his rockets

08:43.840 --> 08:44.960
and lasers.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.000
Yeah, but he was an adult.

08:46.000 --> 08:46.960
He was a jaded adult.

08:46.960 --> 08:47.920
That's fair, fair, fair.

08:47.920 --> 08:48.960
Can Shazam vote?

08:50.000 --> 08:50.640
Huh.

08:50.640 --> 08:55.280
I hope there's a scene about that in the movie, where he uses his greatest superpower, the

08:55.280 --> 08:56.240
ability to vote.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.760
There is a protracted scene where Shazam dies.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.400
Wait, how long?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.800
It's about 14 minutes long.

09:04.800 --> 09:09.520
He dies of an undiagnosed liver infection, and it is extremely sad.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.080
It's right in the middle of a fight, and he just dies.

09:12.080 --> 09:15.360
My one weakness, my organs.

09:15.360 --> 09:21.840
At the end, his torso explodes open, and the boy climbs out, and it's very much Attack

09:21.840 --> 09:25.440
on Titan, which you didn't expect, except instead of a big scary Titan, it is Zachary

09:25.440 --> 09:26.800
Levi's huge adult body.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.300
Yeah.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.200
I love it.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.800
A big scary Levi.

09:30.800 --> 09:31.520
I love it.

09:31.520 --> 09:35.760
It takes him a long time to get through the suit, because it's made of super stuff.

09:35.760 --> 09:36.800
I have a question.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.680
When's Shazam 2 coming out?

09:39.680 --> 09:40.720
Yeah, sure.

09:40.720 --> 09:45.520
That's what's on my plate right now, is I feel like I've already absorbed every part

09:45.520 --> 09:49.840
of this, and I would love to know, when is Shazam 2 due?

09:49.840 --> 09:50.640
When's it coming?

09:50.640 --> 09:51.680
In two months.

09:51.680 --> 09:52.560
It's out in June.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.200
They're doing another one.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.000
Six a year.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.120
That's what he signed up for.

09:57.120 --> 10:02.560
So, the second one is just called Shazam 2, colon, pubes, and this one's mostly about

10:02.560 --> 10:03.840
the pubic experience.

10:04.640 --> 10:07.200
There is, okay, thank you, Griffin, for reminding me.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.560
There is a 13-minute scene earlier in the film.

10:10.560 --> 10:16.800
Just before the liver cancer, before the undiagnosed liver infection claimed Shazam.

10:16.800 --> 10:23.040
There is an earlier scene where he marvels in his thick forest of pubic hair for roughly

10:23.040 --> 10:27.840
13 minutes, just lifting up his golden- Off camera, off camera.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.360
Don't worry, it's very tasteful.

10:29.360 --> 10:34.880
You just watch his beautiful boyfriend, his friend boy, the young boy who brings into

10:34.880 --> 10:40.320
danger with him, sits in an adjacent room and continues to turn up the television louder

10:40.320 --> 10:43.280
and louder to try to cover the sound of his friend marveling.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.160
Whoa, look at it.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.640
Now I see why people call it a bush.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.000
I bet it's invincible, he yells.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
It looks like the prickly mulberry bush outside of my mom's house because mom and dad are

10:58.000 --> 11:01.680
divorced and I can't put them back together with my superpowers.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.840
But whoa, these pubes though.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.600
No, don't turn up, Maury Povich, listen to me.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.680
It's a good flick, got a lot of heart.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.120
April 5th, get there.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.840
It's probably doing good on Rotten Tomatoes, I haven't looked.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.320
Mark Strong's in it, he's a talent.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.320
I do enjoy Mark Strong.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.920
Mark Strong's a huge talent.

11:21.920 --> 11:22.560
Can we do it?

11:22.560 --> 11:24.000
Yeah, first question.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah, when is Shazam 2 coming out?

11:26.000 --> 11:26.800
All right, I already told you.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.080
That was the first one.

11:28.080 --> 11:32.320
My girlfriend and I went out for brunch at a diner near her home to find it was much

11:32.320 --> 11:33.440
busier than usual.

11:33.440 --> 11:37.280
We were able to get a table and enjoy our meal with only slight delays, but it appears

11:37.280 --> 11:39.760
we've been forgotten and our check isn't coming.

11:39.760 --> 11:43.920
We've been served by a rotating cast, so we're not sure who to even ask.

11:43.920 --> 11:47.360
And all the servers are moving at lightning speeds with arms full of plates, so interrupting

11:47.360 --> 11:49.040
them seems like a bad idea.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.560
What is our next move?

11:50.560 --> 11:54.560
Do we dine and dash from a place we really like, would like to return to?

11:54.560 --> 11:56.160
Do we live in this diner now?

11:56.160 --> 11:59.200
That's from Munch Money Misgivings in Minneapolis.

12:00.320 --> 12:04.720
This is, you know that dine and dash is not an option, right?

12:04.720 --> 12:07.920
It's 2019 and it's not 2015.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.920
And so that's not an option anymore.

12:09.920 --> 12:14.800
No, because the government, the GPS will, there's dine and dash and then get followed

12:14.800 --> 12:15.680
by satellites.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.920
That's the actual thing.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.040
In the meatloaf.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.680
Yes, there's nanotech in all foods.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.280
So that's Justin's brand now.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.000
You know not to dine and dash.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.040
I don't know what to tell you on this.

12:29.040 --> 12:33.520
These people are doing their jobs and you got to just assert yourself and squeaky wheel

12:33.520 --> 12:36.080
it and go get your own fucking check.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.280
Just punch it into the machine.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.320
It's easy.

12:38.320 --> 12:39.840
What table are you seated at?

12:39.840 --> 12:41.840
Look, count the number of tables around the room.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.840
Whatever number you land on when you stop is yours.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.760
And you go up and you tap that number.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.680
Now what's the dollar sign say?

12:49.680 --> 12:50.180
15?

12:50.880 --> 12:51.440
That's good.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.640
That's how much you do it for.

12:52.640 --> 12:55.280
And if it's not yours, then you just paid it forward.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.280
And it also kind of sounds like they're super busy.

12:57.280 --> 13:00.960
Maybe once you're done ringing and you're in check, maybe grab a tray and maybe bus

13:00.960 --> 13:01.840
a table or two.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.680
Get your fucking hands dirty.

13:03.680 --> 13:08.160
By which I mean, dunk them in the soup and start just giving it to people.

13:08.160 --> 13:08.560
Yeah.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.120
What's that?

13:09.120 --> 13:09.760
Order up.

13:09.760 --> 13:10.880
Here's a handful of soup.

13:10.880 --> 13:11.360
Oh, thank you.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.120
I've been waiting for 10 minutes for my soup.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.120
It would be, and when the outback steakhouse manager comes out and says, you've got to

13:17.120 --> 13:17.440
stop.

13:17.440 --> 13:18.320
You got to stop.

13:18.320 --> 13:25.440
You got to say, well, if you're not going to fill this charge that you've been given,

13:25.440 --> 13:31.760
then you can't complain when somebody else decides to do your fucking dirty work, Broderick.

13:31.760 --> 13:35.760
And when Broderick tries to fire you, you say, are you ready to pay my unemployment?

13:35.760 --> 13:36.000
Huh?

13:36.640 --> 13:39.040
Because I haven't been given any written warnings yet.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.760
So if you jump right to the termination, I'll see you in court.

13:41.760 --> 13:54.000
There is, we give a lot of guff to cash, dirty, filthy money, but there is something to be

13:54.000 --> 13:58.720
said for the ability of being able to figure out how much your meal is, calculate it in

13:58.720 --> 14:02.160
a tip, and then just leave some money and just walk.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.760
You can bolt whatever you want to.

14:03.760 --> 14:08.800
Yeah, when you look at your money and you think it's disgusting, because statistically

14:08.800 --> 14:13.040
every dollar has been touched by a bug at some point.

14:14.320 --> 14:14.640
Yuck.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.880
But you got to look at it like they're awesome blossom coupons.

14:18.880 --> 14:19.200
Awesome.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.440
They're tickets to an awesome blossom experience.

14:21.440 --> 14:26.000
And you can just leave them on the table and scoot at all and not worry about it.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.200
You know, I've been a waiter slash server slash host several times at different places.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.720
And I think that if I had a table full of people and then I looked over and they were

14:34.720 --> 14:38.560
gone, I would immediately go, oh, and I go look at the table and I'd be like,

14:38.560 --> 14:41.440
oh, there's like three twenties here, huh?

14:41.440 --> 14:42.560
That could be fun.

14:42.560 --> 14:46.800
I guess maybe the money is in like physical form.

14:46.800 --> 14:47.920
That's weird.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.920
I hope they enjoyed their mimosas or whatever.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.480
I wish there had been four twenties.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.680
Oh, Trav, you almost had a good joke, bud.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.280
There's four twenties here.

14:57.280 --> 14:57.920
That's good.

14:57.920 --> 14:58.720
Edit that anger.

14:58.720 --> 14:59.680
I'm blazing.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.280
Well, I'll have to delete yours, Justin.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.160
You okay with that?

15:02.160 --> 15:05.600
Yeah, I don't remember having one, so it won't be missed.

15:05.600 --> 15:09.200
Um, yeah, I think that asked an answer.

15:09.200 --> 15:09.920
How about a Yahoo?

15:10.480 --> 15:11.360
I'd love that, dude.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.080
I love it.

15:12.080 --> 15:12.320
Yeah.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.520
Adrian Cowell sent this one in.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.320
Thanks, Adrian.

15:14.320 --> 15:14.880
Rip it.

15:14.880 --> 15:15.600
Get it out here.

15:16.160 --> 15:16.480
All right.

15:17.360 --> 15:25.520
Asked by Goji Fan, who asks, if you raise a crocodile since its birth, will it ever turn on you?

15:26.080 --> 15:26.720
No.

15:26.720 --> 15:27.600
Next question.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.240
Justin, you have an opinion?

15:31.040 --> 15:32.880
Um, no.

15:33.840 --> 15:34.400
All right.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.040
All right.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.240
As long as it doesn't taste human flesh.

15:38.240 --> 15:41.600
Yeah, it does once, and that's pretty much the ball game, I think.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.000
Yeah, that's true of most animals, though.

15:44.000 --> 15:44.720
Yeah.

15:44.720 --> 15:45.920
Like most pets, at least.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.760
Don't let that turtle get a nip.

15:47.760 --> 15:48.400
Oh, God.

15:49.200 --> 15:54.800
We've all seen the videos of the people who, like, grew up with the lions, or rather,

15:54.800 --> 15:58.400
the lions grew up with them, and then they don't see the lions for a grip,

15:58.400 --> 16:00.880
and then they come back and see the lions, and the lions charge at them,

16:00.880 --> 16:03.600
and you're like, fucking all right, here we go.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.720
But then they just hug them.

16:06.160 --> 16:10.960
I don't know that a crocodile is going to do this.

16:10.960 --> 16:14.480
I don't know that a crocodile is going to be like, is that you, Davis?

16:14.480 --> 16:20.880
And then run up to you and throw their scaly arms around your soft, supple neck.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.720
I don't think you're going to get that exchange.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.080
I've always loved you, Brian.

16:25.120 --> 16:32.160
I don't know how a crocodile shows its affection except for not running fast at you and snapping

16:32.160 --> 16:33.120
its big jaws.

16:33.120 --> 16:36.640
Do you ever think, whenever I see, like, those unlikely animal friends,

16:36.640 --> 16:39.360
and it's like a lion and, like, a Labrador retriever,

16:39.360 --> 16:41.280
all I can think is that the Labrador retriever's like,

16:41.280 --> 16:42.480
ha ha, yeah, we're friends.

16:42.480 --> 16:43.440
Get me out of here.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.160
Get me the fuck.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.200
What are you fucking doing?

16:45.200 --> 16:45.920
Look at this thing.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.280
It's a fucking lion.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.800
Ah, yeah, let's play with the ball.

16:51.440 --> 16:58.240
The fun thing about the unlikely friends, animal friends, is that every time you see

16:58.240 --> 17:04.240
one of those, know that the beginning of that story is some cat who's like, I don't know,

17:04.240 --> 17:04.960
maybe.

17:04.960 --> 17:05.600
Fuck it.

17:05.600 --> 17:06.240
I'm drunk.

17:07.360 --> 17:12.240
Also, for every, like, one of those you see, there's 18 that didn't quite pan out.

17:12.240 --> 17:12.880
Sure.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.600
Oh, that they just didn't click on a friend level.

17:15.600 --> 17:21.040
I'm trying to think of what a crocodile's friend is, and I'm thinking about these birds

17:21.040 --> 17:25.360
that ride on the crocodile's back sometimes, just chilling in the middle of the lake or

17:25.360 --> 17:26.640
the swimming pool.

17:26.640 --> 17:31.920
And then I think that's the only one that they're going to get, because if a bird can

17:31.920 --> 17:37.760
feel the wind changing, can feel a single drop of sweat forming on their crocodile friend,

17:38.480 --> 17:42.800
their crocodile life partner below them, and know that the chomp is coming, and then they

17:42.800 --> 17:45.040
can immediately leave upwards.

17:45.040 --> 17:48.480
They can leave in a direction that the crocodile cannot follow.

17:48.480 --> 17:51.440
I feel like it's a lot more like Dread Pirate Roberts at that point.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.280
Like, I'll most likely kill you in the morning.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.000
Like, cool, cool.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.240
I'm going to sit here so I don't have to keep flying.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.360
I'm very tired.

17:58.000 --> 17:58.960
Extremely tired.

17:58.960 --> 17:59.460
All right.

18:00.320 --> 18:04.400
I used to love playing rock band and guitar here when I was a kid.

18:04.400 --> 18:08.400
I recently dug out my old, I'm sorry, they have a curse word here, but I'll just say

18:08.400 --> 18:11.200
it, shitty, plastic instruments.

18:11.200 --> 18:15.120
Do we have to go blue?

18:15.120 --> 18:18.240
Out of my attic and found I was missing a set of drumsticks.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.960
There are a few music stores within driving distance where I can buy some, but I don't

18:22.960 --> 18:24.320
really play the drums.

18:24.320 --> 18:30.160
I'm afraid someone will ask me something about my drums or what kind of drumsticks I want

18:30.160 --> 18:31.520
or really anything at all.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.600
I'll look so stupid.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.240
What do I do?

18:35.760 --> 18:39.200
I mean, there are electric drums, right?

18:39.200 --> 18:41.920
Like, you could say I'm an electric drummer.

18:41.920 --> 18:42.480
They probably don't say that.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.880
Tell me about what kind of electric drum set you got.

18:48.000 --> 18:48.880
I have a...

18:50.720 --> 18:53.840
Get the fuck out of here, you're a fucking liar.

18:53.840 --> 18:54.720
No, no, no.

18:54.720 --> 18:55.520
I know the brand.

18:55.520 --> 18:58.160
It's a microphone dice.

18:58.960 --> 18:59.520
What?

18:59.520 --> 19:00.320
Monitor.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.760
Microphone dice monitor.

19:01.760 --> 19:05.840
Are you just looking around your own room looking for things you see?

19:06.720 --> 19:07.840
It's Good Beats.

19:07.840 --> 19:08.720
It's a Good Beats.

19:08.720 --> 19:09.760
It is not.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.040
It is not a Good Beats.

19:11.040 --> 19:14.240
Good Beats hasn't put out a drum set in over 20 years.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.120
It's vintage.

19:15.760 --> 19:16.640
It's vintage?

19:16.640 --> 19:17.040
Really?

19:17.680 --> 19:20.160
It's a vintage Good Beats drum set.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.160
Where did you get a vintage Good Beats?

19:22.160 --> 19:24.000
Those are like $50,000.

19:24.720 --> 19:25.360
Get out of here.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.800
That's just a guy in the background playing the guitar really loud

19:30.800 --> 19:31.760
so that you know how good he is.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.880
In every music store ever, could you keep a down guy on guitar?

19:34.880 --> 19:38.080
I'm talking to this dude about his vintage $50,000 Good Beats.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.640
Yeah, I sure will put the headphones in.

19:41.280 --> 19:41.600
Okay.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.040
So tell me more about what kind of drum set you...

19:47.040 --> 19:48.160
You're singing out loud.

19:48.960 --> 19:49.920
Excuse me.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.480
You're saying it out loud while you're playing.

19:52.480 --> 19:53.600
Yeah, I do that.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.720
Helps me visualize the tunes.

19:56.720 --> 19:57.200
What's up?

19:57.200 --> 20:00.000
It's me, Sammy Hagar.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.320
Whoa, in my store?

20:02.320 --> 20:03.600
Sorry, I said it wrong.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.280
It's me, Hammy Sagar.

20:05.920 --> 20:09.280
Hammy, you gotta talk to this dude about his $50,000 vintage Good Beats.

20:09.280 --> 20:12.400
Oh no, he already stole all the drumsticks and ran out the door

20:13.280 --> 20:14.080
while you were talking.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.600
It's the perfect crime.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.880
Yeah, he never saw that.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.240
So get Hammy Sagar.

20:18.240 --> 20:21.840
You're working with a local Sammy Hagar impressionist.

20:21.840 --> 20:25.760
You're working with a Jillbin, a Silbin?

20:25.760 --> 20:27.440
There's one of those letters, man.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.360
Wait, are you really Hammy Sagar?

20:29.360 --> 20:33.920
Maybe, I just burst out of your brother's torso.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.760
Now I'm a podcast man.

20:35.760 --> 20:39.120
Whoa, I don't know where in a bit.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.320
Are there any famous drummers?

20:41.520 --> 20:46.800
Okay, like let's say, how about Keith Moon, Ringo Starr?

20:46.800 --> 20:48.160
Keith Moon's dead, that's not good.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.240
Let's say Ringo Starr.

20:50.240 --> 20:55.280
Can you go in and say you are Ringo Starr's assistant

20:55.840 --> 20:57.360
and he's doing a concert nearby.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.600
You don't know fucking anything about drums

20:59.600 --> 21:02.400
and I need a pair of drums, drumsticks.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.320
And they're like, what kind of drums do you play?

21:04.320 --> 21:07.440
And then you can be like, I think you should know it's Ringo Starr.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.520
You tell me what kind of drums he plays.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.760
And then they feel like the idiot because they don't know

21:11.760 --> 21:14.960
and they're just gonna sheepishly sell you them at a great rate.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.440
Or better yet, when he's like, what kind of drums?

21:17.440 --> 21:19.520
I don't know, it's my first day working for him

21:19.520 --> 21:20.400
and start crying.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.040
You'll probably get a discount at that point.

21:24.240 --> 21:27.120
You could also say, let me get some drumsticks

21:27.120 --> 21:28.960
and they'll say, oh, what kind of set do you play?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.920
No, it's for eating corn cobs off of.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.200
No, I just have big hands

21:35.200 --> 21:36.960
so traditional chopsticks don't work for me.

21:36.960 --> 21:37.920
They don't work for me.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.080
I'm Hammy Sagar, look at my huge palms.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.880
I have to use drumsticks because I want everything I eat

21:42.880 --> 21:46.800
to taste like rock and roll.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.760
No, I'm trying to fight some rock vampires

21:50.400 --> 21:53.040
and this is the only way I'm gonna be able to get close to him.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.520
Itadakimasu, it's me, Hammy Sagar,

21:55.520 --> 21:58.720
ready to enjoy this delicious meal you've prepared for me.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.280
Does Sammy Hagar have a restaurant?

22:03.280 --> 22:05.760
Does Sammy, he should, shouldn't he?

22:05.760 --> 22:06.880
It seems like he does.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.040
I'm gonna follow my spirit on this

22:09.040 --> 22:11.600
and just Google Sammy Hagar restaurant

22:11.600 --> 22:14.400
and see Sammy Hagar's Beach Bar and Grill.

22:15.840 --> 22:20.160
Fuck yes, it just seemed like he would and then he did.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.200
Check and mate.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.760
He's got five.

22:23.760 --> 22:24.960
Holy shit.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.520
If you wanna enjoy Sammy's Beach Bar and Grill,

22:27.520 --> 22:33.440
you can head to Glamorous, Honolulu, Maui, Las Vegas,

22:34.560 --> 22:39.680
Cleveland, Southland Park Gaming and Racing Center.

22:39.680 --> 22:43.280
Now I can justify the first three

22:44.320 --> 22:47.760
and I bet Cleveland it's close to the Hall of,

22:47.760 --> 22:49.200
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.040
Maybe, maybe.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.680
When I'm walking through the hallowed halls of Hall of Fame

22:55.680 --> 22:57.760
learning about all my favorite rock legends,

22:57.760 --> 23:00.400
I see Sammy Hagar not in there, I think.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.640
All I can think is, boy,

23:02.640 --> 23:05.760
I wonder what this man could do to a set of chicken wings.

23:05.760 --> 23:10.640
And that's how he made it into the cooking Hall of Fame.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.120
True, multidisciplinarian.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.040
Can we talk about the Max Fun Drive again?

23:15.040 --> 23:17.120
Cause it's been so long that I'm starting to get the jitters.

23:17.920 --> 23:18.720
I would love to.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.200
Can I tell you, all right, yep.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.400
So fucking funny, dude.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.000
Thanks, dude.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.240
So here's what I wanna say.

23:26.240 --> 23:29.040
Can I be personal for a moment?

23:29.040 --> 23:31.200
Get personal, dude.

23:31.200 --> 23:34.160
Let me open my heart like Shazam

23:34.160 --> 23:36.560
and let my little kid inside out.

23:36.560 --> 23:36.960
All right.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.200
I keep a boy in my chest.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.120
Okay, what do you wanna say here?

23:41.120 --> 23:42.000
No, that's what I wanna say.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.200
I keep a boy in my chest.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.080
Jeez, Trav.

23:44.080 --> 23:46.640
But I wouldn't be able to do that if it weren't for donors.

23:46.640 --> 23:49.600
Well, you're a broad-shouldered gentleman,

23:49.600 --> 23:52.960
so I could see somebody meet Davin in there

23:52.960 --> 23:55.360
with a certain amount of comfort.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.040
You could have also gone with Krangin.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.000
I would have given you that.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.560
I think there's a thing in Men in Black

24:00.560 --> 24:02.800
where there's a person inside a person's chest.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.840
Anyways, we are all at this point

24:05.840 --> 24:08.240
full-time professional podcasters.

24:08.240 --> 24:11.120
And the only reason we are able to do that

24:11.120 --> 24:12.400
is because of donors,

24:12.400 --> 24:15.280
because of MaxFunDrive and the MaxFun donors.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.800
And it's one of those things where,

24:16.800 --> 24:18.800
and I tweeted about this last week,

24:18.800 --> 24:22.960
but I do about every four weeks,

24:22.960 --> 24:25.520
14 episodes of content for MaxFun.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.480
And that's a lot.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.040
But the reason I do that

24:31.040 --> 24:32.480
and the reason I care about it so much

24:32.480 --> 24:34.480
is I know how much it matters to you.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.360
I see people tweet about it all year

24:37.360 --> 24:39.280
and people show it to our shows.

24:39.280 --> 24:43.360
But during MaxFunDrive, I get this big burst of inspiration

24:43.360 --> 24:45.120
because I see all these people saying,

24:45.120 --> 24:46.480
this is why this matters to me.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.840
This is why I love MaxFun.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.680
This is why I love my brother, my brother and me

24:49.680 --> 24:51.280
and the Adventure Zone and Sawbones

24:51.280 --> 24:52.560
and Schmaners and Wonderful

24:52.560 --> 24:54.800
and Trends Like These and Still Buffering.

24:54.800 --> 25:00.160
And that just, it fills me with so much joy and gratitude.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.120
And horny power.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.160
And horny power.

25:02.160 --> 25:06.160
And that horny power is what fuels me for another year.

25:06.160 --> 25:09.280
That horny fire in my soul just keeps me going.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.240
Yeah, I think what Travis is trying to say

25:12.240 --> 25:16.000
is you can support the things that you care about

25:16.000 --> 25:18.400
and that you want to be in the world.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.480
And that support means the world to us,

25:20.480 --> 25:23.040
even no matter what level it is.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.400
We get a lot of tweets from people saying like,

25:24.400 --> 25:26.080
sorry, I can only do $5 a month.

25:26.080 --> 25:27.040
That's huge.

25:27.040 --> 25:30.880
That is you advocating for the stuff that we make.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.680
And that's like the most meaningful thing

25:33.680 --> 25:36.480
that you can do for a creator.

25:36.480 --> 25:38.240
And you've been so kind to us in the past

25:38.240 --> 25:40.240
with your donations and your support.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.160
So if you just started listening

25:42.160 --> 25:44.800
or maybe you're listening to more shows on the network,

25:45.360 --> 25:46.240
consider donating.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.040
You get to pick the shows you want to directly support

25:49.040 --> 25:51.520
and your money will go to them.

25:51.520 --> 25:55.040
And yeah, this is the time of year

25:55.040 --> 25:58.720
where just think about what you have gotten

25:58.720 --> 25:59.840
out of the shows that we make.

25:59.840 --> 26:04.400
And if you have the means and you feel comfortable doing so,

26:04.400 --> 26:06.160
go to maximumfun.org slash donate

26:06.160 --> 26:08.160
and get those great rewards,

26:08.160 --> 26:10.880
like the bonus content at five bucks

26:10.880 --> 26:13.440
or the pins at 10 bucks.

26:13.440 --> 26:14.960
There's a lot of options there.

26:14.960 --> 26:17.280
This is also the best time to upgrade your donation.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.200
Maybe you've been a member for a while

26:19.200 --> 26:21.360
and you've started listening to more shows

26:21.360 --> 26:24.320
or they filled an even more important part of your life,

26:24.320 --> 26:27.120
whatever, maybe you got a big raise at work or whatever.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.600
You know, maybe it's time to bump up from five to 10

26:29.600 --> 26:30.560
or 10 to 20.

26:30.560 --> 26:31.680
And when you do,

26:31.680 --> 26:34.400
you will also get some of those new rewards for this year.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.200
And I also want to say one last thing

26:37.200 --> 26:38.400
before we move on to other questions.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.560
I know that not everybody can donate.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.320
You know, there was a time in my life

26:42.320 --> 26:44.400
where $5 a month was out of the question

26:44.400 --> 26:45.680
for stuff like this,

26:45.680 --> 26:48.400
but you can still help out by going to Twitter

26:48.400 --> 26:51.840
or Instagram or whatever social media you use

26:51.840 --> 26:54.960
and sharing the link maximumfun.org forward slash donate

26:54.960 --> 26:57.600
and use the hashtag maxfundrive and tell people

26:57.600 --> 26:59.680
why they should donate and why the shows matter

26:59.680 --> 27:01.920
and why, you know, like if you have a friend

27:01.920 --> 27:03.280
who, you know, listens to the show

27:03.280 --> 27:05.120
and, you know, maybe say to them like,

27:05.120 --> 27:07.680
hey, did you know the maxfundrive is going on?

27:07.680 --> 27:09.120
And make sure that they know about it.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.960
All those things really help us out.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.480
Can we just talk real quick about the bonus?

27:14.480 --> 27:17.120
Just like, can I just talk about the bonus content real quick?

27:17.120 --> 27:17.520
Go for it.

27:17.520 --> 27:18.720
You can give $5 a month.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.040
Just our shows, right?

27:21.040 --> 27:25.280
There are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

27:26.080 --> 27:29.920
nine, 10, 11 bonus episodes of My Brother, My Brother, Me

27:29.920 --> 27:33.920
in there, which includes the Ghost Horse Fugue

27:33.920 --> 27:37.280
for Brother Horns demo by Lin-Manuel Miranda.

27:37.280 --> 27:40.080
Him singing that demo is in there.

27:40.720 --> 27:43.600
The one and only episode of Big Gulp Live

27:43.600 --> 27:46.080
is in the archives in there.

27:46.080 --> 27:53.040
There are videos of us goofing on like educational videos.

27:53.040 --> 27:57.440
There is Still Buffering played D&D.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.200
We played Honey Heist.

28:00.000 --> 28:00.960
Oh shit, that was so fun.

28:00.960 --> 28:02.960
For Taz, it was really fun and funny.

28:02.960 --> 28:07.600
We also played, Lin and us played Dungeons & Dragons one time

28:08.640 --> 28:11.120
and he was a bard and it was really fun

28:11.120 --> 28:14.880
and there's just like so much great stuff in there

28:14.880 --> 28:19.120
and you get access to all of it for donating five bucks a month

28:19.680 --> 28:23.680
and I think it would really mean a lot to us.

28:23.680 --> 28:26.320
One last thing, and I'm recording this after the fact

28:26.320 --> 28:28.240
if you can't tell because we forgot to mention it.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.520
We are going to do a few other stretch goals

28:31.520 --> 28:36.000
for numbers we hit as the whole MaxFun community

28:36.000 --> 28:37.200
for this drive.

28:37.200 --> 28:40.240
The first thing may be relevant if you know the history

28:40.240 --> 28:41.600
of My Brother, My Brother, and Me

28:41.600 --> 28:44.960
and our failures.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.680
At 12,500 new and upgrading MaxFun members

28:47.680 --> 28:52.160
which is half of our station-wide goal of 25,000

28:52.800 --> 28:56.240
we're going to put out the May the 4th Star Wars episode

28:56.240 --> 29:00.160
that we did live at Detroit, the Detroit disaster episode.

29:00.160 --> 29:02.160
We're going to put that in the donor bonus feed

29:03.040 --> 29:05.280
which again you get access to at five dollars a month

29:05.280 --> 29:07.760
and at 15,000 new and upgrading MaxFun members

29:07.760 --> 29:10.000
we're going to put out the episode

29:10.000 --> 29:12.320
of the Adventure Zone Elementary that we recorded

29:12.320 --> 29:16.800
on the Joko Cruise in which we had a fifth Sherlock Holmes

29:16.800 --> 29:21.040
who was Pat Rothfuss and that one, wow, the mystery

29:21.040 --> 29:22.640
really got away from us that time.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.440
So yeah, two additional bonus episodes

29:25.440 --> 29:27.120
that we're going to put up as stretch goals

29:27.120 --> 29:30.160
and we may do some more later on this week.

29:30.160 --> 29:33.200
TheMaximumFun.org forward slash donate.

29:33.760 --> 29:34.960
Get that money.

29:34.960 --> 29:40.320
I don't know what's soundboard

29:40.320 --> 29:41.840
and what's not soundboard anymore.

29:41.840 --> 29:44.880
What?

29:44.880 --> 29:46.160
I want a munch.

29:46.160 --> 29:46.800
Squad.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.360
I want to munch.

29:51.360 --> 29:54.480
Squad, oh.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.680
I put a little British ant fuzz on that one

29:57.680 --> 30:00.640
and a little bit of British stank.

30:00.640 --> 30:04.160
I got a little, is it ACDC out of that, was that?

30:04.160 --> 30:06.720
A little bit of ACDC or acted.

30:09.120 --> 30:12.640
Or air conditioned and air conditioned.

30:13.440 --> 30:17.440
Air conditioned Dave Coulier as they sometimes are known.

30:18.240 --> 30:18.800
It's back.

30:19.440 --> 30:24.240
Pizza Hut brings back cult favorite Pazon from March Madness.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.280
Folks, the Pazon is back.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.520
This isn't even that funny of a one.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.200
It's more like Max Fun Drive time

30:31.200 --> 30:33.440
to give back public service announcement.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.200
The Pazon is back.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.720
That means I have to stop referring

30:36.720 --> 30:40.080
to a person's genital triangle as their Pazon

30:40.080 --> 30:42.400
because now it means something else again.

30:43.280 --> 30:44.640
It could get confusing if you're like,

30:44.640 --> 30:46.320
hey, can I have some of your Pazon?

30:46.320 --> 30:47.200
And they're like, oh.

30:47.200 --> 30:48.960
My genital triangle?

30:48.960 --> 30:49.600
No, no, no.

30:50.320 --> 30:53.920
It's a perfect addition to any March Madness watch party.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.720
Customers can choose from pepperoni,

30:56.720 --> 30:58.720
meaty and supremo recipes.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.080
Oh yeah.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.600
Yeah, so you got a lot of options.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.920
Here's a quote from Marianne Radley,

31:03.920 --> 31:05.440
the chief brand officer of Pizza Hut.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.280
The McElroys talk about this all the time.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.520
So we thought we might as well bring it back.

31:09.520 --> 31:10.480
It's not a wiener.

31:11.680 --> 31:14.000
March Madness is not a wiener.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.040
It's one of the most captivating sports moments of the year.

31:17.040 --> 31:19.280
We're excited to bring that back to Pazon

31:19.280 --> 31:21.440
as part of our $5 lineup during a time

31:21.440 --> 31:23.040
when friends and family will be gathering

31:23.040 --> 31:25.280
in anticipation and excitement.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.600
Boy, it sounds like Marianne has maybe

31:27.600 --> 31:30.320
never been to a party before.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.480
You know how when your friends and family gather

31:32.480 --> 31:34.240
in anticipation and excitement,

31:34.240 --> 31:36.480
do you mean a party to watch sports, Marianne?

31:36.480 --> 31:37.920
Hey, do you guys want to come over

31:37.920 --> 31:41.440
and anticipate another basketball game with me?

31:41.440 --> 31:43.440
I guess so.

31:43.440 --> 31:46.320
Listen, Marianne, who is not a robot, continues,

31:46.320 --> 31:48.960
even if your team doesn't advance in the tournament.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.920
Even if the human players don't score enough points.

31:55.920 --> 32:00.560
If ball does not enter ring a satisfactory number of times.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.880
The comeback of the Pazon is something

32:02.880 --> 32:05.760
we know all fans can rally around.

32:05.760 --> 32:08.320
I see here you've written at the end of your bracket,

32:08.320 --> 32:12.480
the Pazon back baby, and you write,

32:12.480 --> 32:14.240
here's $25 million.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.440
You won the universal bracket competition.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.160
You won it.

32:18.160 --> 32:20.240
Hey, Pizza Hut, bring back the Bigfoot,

32:20.240 --> 32:21.440
you fucking cowards.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.480
I want to achieve my life's goal

32:24.480 --> 32:27.360
of being crushed to death by a Bigfoot pizza

32:27.360 --> 32:29.280
falling over on me, and that's not gonna happen

32:29.280 --> 32:30.400
without your help.

32:30.400 --> 32:34.560
God, this fucking press release, it continues.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.480
The ads, there's gonna be ads

32:36.480 --> 32:38.320
during March Madness for the Pazon.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.560
The ads include some of the most famous

32:40.560 --> 32:43.040
March Madness reaction memes from recent years.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.000
That sounds pretty good.

32:46.800 --> 32:50.240
From recent years, like the what just happened whale

32:50.240 --> 32:53.600
featuring John Phillips, a diehard Northwestern fan,

32:53.600 --> 32:57.760
and viral sensation from the 2017 NCAA tournament.

32:58.880 --> 33:02.080
It's just like, are you advertising,

33:02.640 --> 33:06.720
are you advertising the memes that are in your thing?

33:07.280 --> 33:08.480
Is that what's going on?

33:08.480 --> 33:12.160
Yeah, I guess this is a guy who got sad in a way

33:12.160 --> 33:15.680
that everyone really liked, and so because of him,

33:15.680 --> 33:18.240
I will eat your pizza, though.

33:18.240 --> 33:20.400
I get so hungry seeing other people's

33:20.400 --> 33:22.160
disappointment and sadness.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.880
Yeah, well, it was sad in a way that I thought

33:24.880 --> 33:26.640
I found entertaining in a big way,

33:26.640 --> 33:28.800
so it did make me hungry for your pizza zone.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.080
Yes, a lack of empathy really gets me salivating.

33:32.720 --> 33:38.080
I'm just trying to find a clip of this fucking sound,

33:38.080 --> 33:40.160
like this whale that apparently is so funny

33:40.160 --> 33:42.640
they've gotta use it to sell pizza calzones.

33:43.760 --> 33:44.880
What happened whale?

33:44.880 --> 33:46.000
The what happened whale?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.600
I'm not moving on until I can find it,

33:47.600 --> 33:48.960
so just warning you.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.280
Now the first thing that comes up for me

33:51.280 --> 33:53.280
is an article from the Natural History Museum

33:53.280 --> 33:55.600
that says what happens to a whale when it dies?

33:55.600 --> 33:56.880
It's probably not that, right?

33:57.600 --> 33:59.760
I'm reading about a whale prison.

33:59.760 --> 34:03.440
A guy, like the first result is just this kid,

34:04.960 --> 34:06.240
it's just a GIF.

34:06.240 --> 34:07.840
It's just a GIF of a kid, I mean,

34:07.840 --> 34:10.960
it's just a GIF of a kid who's sad about basketball.

34:10.960 --> 34:15.760
Like, it's just a GIF of a kid who's sad about basketball.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.120
I want to watch this guy get sad

34:17.120 --> 34:18.400
and have a fun time with him.

34:18.400 --> 34:19.600
I'm gonna put it in the thing.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.200
It's just, it's nothing.

34:22.240 --> 34:24.160
It's from 2017.

34:24.160 --> 34:26.720
This kid's got a home and three kids right now.

34:29.520 --> 34:30.960
What is marketable about this?

34:30.960 --> 34:34.480
Well, he's really, he's genuinely sad.

34:34.480 --> 34:37.440
He's the son of the athletic director of the losing team.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.720
I imagine he's quite upset about his father's,

34:42.080 --> 34:46.240
you know, his father's shameful sports defeat.

34:46.240 --> 34:48.320
He just loves his boy.

34:48.320 --> 34:52.160
Watching this child, this has no retweets and no likes.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.880
There was somebody at Pizza Hut

34:54.880 --> 34:57.200
who very much enjoyed watching this boy

34:57.200 --> 35:00.400
watch his father get sports defeated

35:00.400 --> 35:03.440
and thought that it's gonna sell mad zones.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.400
It's just, you can't even find,

35:06.400 --> 35:08.960
so the Northwestern kid, I guess, was a thing.

35:08.960 --> 35:11.520
He was just really sad about the sports.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.280
Yeah, he was just a sad boy.

35:13.280 --> 35:16.080
He was just a sad boy who was sad about the game.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.080
Anyway, I got another story.

35:18.080 --> 35:22.080
I remember when my dad got fired from the radio station

35:22.080 --> 35:24.880
and fell down a flight of stairs on his way out

35:24.880 --> 35:28.960
and I cried and then someone took a picture of that

35:28.960 --> 35:31.760
and then they started selling Big Macs with it.

35:31.760 --> 35:35.920
Okay, this goes on to brag about Book It

35:35.920 --> 35:37.920
and it says the literacy project,

35:39.200 --> 35:40.240
you know, Book It?

35:40.240 --> 35:41.280
Yeah, dude.

35:41.280 --> 35:42.720
You read books, you get free pizza.

35:42.720 --> 35:44.000
You get free pizza.

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
It says here, in partnership with Philips, who is,

35:50.320 --> 35:53.920
oh, Philips, I guess the boy, the crying boy.

35:53.920 --> 35:58.920
After my dad lost the big game, I read a bunch of books.

36:00.480 --> 36:02.000
They're partnering with the boy

36:02.000 --> 36:05.280
to provide equal access to books and educational resources.

36:05.280 --> 36:09.440
Pizza Hut is donating $20,000.

36:09.440 --> 36:11.280
Wow, you shouldn't have.

36:11.280 --> 36:14.040
You made that five minutes ago, you fuckos.

36:14.040 --> 36:14.880
Really?

36:14.880 --> 36:17.640
$20,000 Pizza Hut?

36:17.640 --> 36:18.480
Are you sure?

36:20.360 --> 36:21.200
Unbelievable.

36:21.200 --> 36:23.760
But they're making this sad boy pay for it.

36:23.760 --> 36:27.200
The sad boy has to clear out his college savings.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.520
He's gotta wash ditches at a Pizza Hut

36:30.520 --> 36:32.200
to earn that $20,000.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.960
Griffin, you had a Yahoo all lined up for us

36:36.960 --> 36:38.320
before I so rudely interrupted you.

36:38.320 --> 36:41.040
Yeah, so I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by Kalen.

36:41.040 --> 36:41.880
Thanks, Kalen.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.000
It's Yahoo Answers user, Dan, who asks,

36:44.840 --> 36:46.240
I don't get it.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.240
What's the point of bubble bath?

36:49.240 --> 36:50.320
Ever since I was a kid,

36:50.320 --> 36:52.960
I never understood what the deal is with bubble bath.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.320
Does it get you cleaner than just soap and water?

36:55.320 --> 36:57.680
Or is it just a stupid load of crud?

36:57.680 --> 36:59.640
Or is it meant to make you feel

36:59.640 --> 37:01.720
like you're a millionaire when you ain't?

37:01.720 --> 37:06.200
Or does it have some function I never understood?

37:06.200 --> 37:07.360
Like, is the whole point of it

37:07.360 --> 37:09.960
so as you can have someone else in the room

37:09.960 --> 37:11.920
while you're bathing and they can't see your private parts

37:11.920 --> 37:13.160
because of the bubbles?

37:13.160 --> 37:15.840
Or is bubble bath just totally pointless?

37:17.080 --> 37:20.960
This person just listed three great things about bubble bath

37:20.960 --> 37:22.720
and they're still wondering what the point of it is.

37:22.720 --> 37:23.760
You're getting it.

37:23.760 --> 37:27.160
Yeah, there's not some secret hidden bubble bath agenda

37:27.160 --> 37:29.000
that you're, yeah, that's it.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.240
It makes you feel like a millionaire when you ain't.

37:31.240 --> 37:33.240
That's the first thing, no question.

37:33.240 --> 37:35.240
Two, people can't see your private parts.

37:35.240 --> 37:36.080
Absolutely.

37:36.080 --> 37:36.920
It's great for taking pictures of your kids.

37:36.920 --> 37:39.680
You could not show the act of bathing in most films

37:39.680 --> 37:40.800
without, or else, you know?

37:40.800 --> 37:41.720
Yes.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.720
Or take tasteful pictures of your toddlers

37:43.720 --> 37:45.200
because there's a bubble bath and it's adorable.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.040
Oh, it's so funny.

37:46.040 --> 37:47.960
Oh, it looks like they've got a beard and a hat on

37:47.960 --> 37:49.000
and you can't see their pizones.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.920
And Travis has just touched on the next thing,

37:50.920 --> 37:53.120
which is the Santa beard is very good.

37:53.120 --> 37:55.040
Santa beard is very good.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.400
I bet this guy goes to the park

37:56.400 --> 37:57.640
where kids are playing with bubble wands

37:57.640 --> 37:58.800
and he's like, what's the point?

37:58.800 --> 38:00.200
Does it get you clean?

38:00.200 --> 38:01.040
I mean, it could.

38:01.040 --> 38:01.880
Does this get you high?

38:01.880 --> 38:03.080
Does it get you high?

38:04.000 --> 38:05.240
These bubbles get you kids high?

38:05.240 --> 38:06.080
I don't get it.

38:06.080 --> 38:06.920
What's the point?

38:06.920 --> 38:08.640
I do wanna say this about bubble bath.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.960
I wish there was a off switch.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.640
Once you board the bubble bath train,

38:13.640 --> 38:15.160
you can't go back to water bath.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.240
You simply cannot.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.960
And it is for this reason that my,

38:19.960 --> 38:22.880
I used to draw a bubble bath for my son

38:22.880 --> 38:24.360
and I did it for a while

38:24.360 --> 38:28.960
and then he started just requesting no bubbles.

38:28.960 --> 38:31.720
He's the only two-year-old that I know of who's like,

38:31.720 --> 38:35.240
I'll just do a water one this time and every time.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.440
I hate those bubbles because you can't turn them off.

38:37.440 --> 38:40.040
They're just always there once you do them.

38:40.040 --> 38:41.280
And you can't actually,

38:41.280 --> 38:43.360
it's so hard to rinse bubbles off.

38:43.360 --> 38:48.360
Like, yeah, it is a, yeah.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.760
Bubbles, bubble baths are a lot.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.320
Also, if kids are real young,

38:52.320 --> 38:53.160
you shouldn't do bubble baths.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.160
It's bad for their skin,

38:54.160 --> 38:58.440
especially young people with vaginas.

38:58.440 --> 38:59.280
It's not great for them.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.920
Just a little PSA for me.

39:00.920 --> 39:04.640
I would like to pitch this, a new bubble bath strat.

39:04.640 --> 39:05.480
Okay.

39:05.480 --> 39:08.800
Make a little bucket of bubble bath on the side.

39:08.800 --> 39:12.520
Then you can place the, you can do the bubble hat.

39:12.520 --> 39:13.920
You could do the bubble beard.

39:13.920 --> 39:16.800
You could even tastefully place some bubble coverage,

39:16.800 --> 39:21.800
but you have sequestered the bubbles over in a safe area

39:22.000 --> 39:23.120
where they can be admired.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.700
Oh, those are some great bubbles,

39:24.700 --> 39:29.480
but they're not over here infesting my whole bath zone.

39:29.480 --> 39:30.340
That's fun.

39:30.340 --> 39:33.580
There's also this, a second bathtub

39:33.580 --> 39:37.800
that sits in the ceiling above your current bathtub.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.240
And when you fill up your bathtub,

39:39.240 --> 39:42.000
upstairs bathtub also gets filled up.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.960
And then when you want the bubbles

39:43.960 --> 39:45.720
in your fun bath to go away,

39:45.720 --> 39:46.920
when the person's left the room

39:46.920 --> 39:50.800
and you can lock your genitals to really

39:50.800 --> 39:53.100
just scuba around down there

39:53.100 --> 39:55.800
without being obfuscated by the suds,

39:55.800 --> 39:57.160
then you pull the lever

39:57.160 --> 40:00.020
and the floor of your tub opens up

40:00.020 --> 40:01.560
and it falls out of the house.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.600
And then the floor of the upstairs bath opens

40:03.600 --> 40:06.320
and it instantly refills with clean, beautiful,

40:06.320 --> 40:08.760
easy breezy, beautiful bubble-free water.

40:08.760 --> 40:11.440
And Gromit brings you a sandwich or whatever.

40:11.440 --> 40:14.680
Yeah, and then your breakfast gets made

40:14.680 --> 40:18.320
and your Mr. Bean or whatever.

40:18.320 --> 40:20.400
Mr. T cereal pours out

40:20.400 --> 40:22.360
and you only eat like two pieces of it.

40:22.360 --> 40:24.920
You can laugh at me, but let me ask you this.

40:24.920 --> 40:25.880
Okay.

40:25.880 --> 40:27.720
You ever seen Mr. Bean's dick?

40:27.720 --> 40:31.840
Oh, Griffin, please don't let me talk about this again.

40:31.840 --> 40:35.680
I didn't realize it was Sunday afternoon already.

40:35.680 --> 40:38.760
It's time for a regular weekly conference call with Griffin.

40:38.760 --> 40:40.440
Have you ever seen Mr. Bean's dick?

40:40.440 --> 40:41.720
Listen, they had to put butts in the seats

40:41.720 --> 40:43.420
at Johnny English 3 somehow.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.200
Griffin, by the last time, Johnny English isn't Mr. Bean.

40:48.200 --> 40:51.320
You can fucking pry that out of my cold, dead hands.

40:51.320 --> 40:53.280
You can lean over my casket at my funeral

40:53.280 --> 40:55.200
and be like, it's not true.

40:55.200 --> 40:57.920
That's the only way you're gonna take that from me, bud,

40:57.920 --> 41:02.280
because he is Mr. Bean and he talks normaler.

41:03.680 --> 41:05.400
He gets up in a wacky hijinx and he can't,

41:05.400 --> 41:07.880
he fucking, you know, his pants falls down

41:07.880 --> 41:10.480
and he doesn't do being a spy good.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.800
Hello, does that sound like Mr. Bean

41:12.800 --> 41:15.040
who goes into the museum and makes a big mess?

41:15.040 --> 41:16.680
Hello, Mr. Fly. Thank you.

41:16.680 --> 41:18.400
I can't believe that you're not on my side on this.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.980
I'm actually kind of heartbroken about it.

41:19.980 --> 41:22.080
I feel like you're just being devil's advocate.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.320
No, I'm sorry, Griffin.

41:23.320 --> 41:24.360
All right.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.280
It's a different person.

41:25.280 --> 41:28.240
He's also not the same guy from the remake of Rat Race.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.680
He is similar, though.

41:29.680 --> 41:33.240
Mr. Bean is very similar to the guy from Rat Race.

41:33.240 --> 41:36.040
I think he only says the one thing, it's an ace.

41:36.040 --> 41:37.720
Like, that's the only thing.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.280
But he's also not Blackadder.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.840
Blackadder is a completely different character.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.300
That's different, that one's different.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.000
But the other ones where he's Mr. Bean,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.760
I think he's actually Mr. Bean in those.

41:46.760 --> 41:49.220
So like, wait, so does Johnny English

41:49.220 --> 41:52.240
come before Mr. Bean where maybe he sees too much

41:52.240 --> 41:53.920
and he's like, I'll never speak again.

41:53.920 --> 41:54.760
I'll never, I can't.

41:54.760 --> 41:56.760
Johnny English never comes before anyone.

41:56.760 --> 41:58.920
He's a proper British gentleman

41:58.920 --> 42:01.880
that knows how to make a lover laugh.

42:01.880 --> 42:04.880
He knows to take care, it's like eating Chinese food,

42:04.880 --> 42:06.720
it's not over till everybody gets their cookies.

42:06.720 --> 42:09.080
That's a line from Alec Baldwin's movie.

42:10.080 --> 42:11.200
Boss Baby.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.020
The Shadow in Boss Baby.

42:13.020 --> 42:13.860
Yeah.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.740
I watched Boss Baby fucking twice on the cruise.

42:18.740 --> 42:19.880
How was your guys cruise?

42:19.880 --> 42:20.720
I had fun.

42:20.720 --> 42:24.000
I didn't get diarrhea against the will of God and man.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.560
And I watched Boss Baby twice.

42:25.560 --> 42:27.720
Pretty good time, I think, I had.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.280
Did you know there's a Netflix series?

42:30.280 --> 42:32.100
You can just transition straight into that.

42:32.100 --> 42:34.580
I think it's on its like eighth season.

42:34.580 --> 42:37.360
Six episodes of our show on TV was done,

42:37.360 --> 42:39.200
but we've got, we're up to like six seasons

42:39.200 --> 42:41.480
of Boss Baby bossing around or whatever

42:41.480 --> 42:42.320
the fucking Netflix show is called.

42:42.320 --> 42:43.960
Are you really trying to compare the quality of our show

42:43.960 --> 42:46.440
to the quality of Boss Baby, Griffin, or Justin?

42:46.440 --> 42:47.280
Which one are you?

42:47.280 --> 42:50.140
I mean, the animation is about equal,

42:50.140 --> 42:55.140
but the voices in ours are a lot better.

42:56.600 --> 42:57.640
All right, let's start.

42:57.640 --> 43:00.840
You remember who made it, so be nice.

43:00.840 --> 43:02.760
Oh, you're right, it is a DreamWorks thing.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.120
Get that money.

43:04.120 --> 43:07.680
Okay, you got me on that one.

43:07.680 --> 43:09.200
That one is really good.

43:09.200 --> 43:10.040
I thought that one worked.

43:10.040 --> 43:13.240
Yeah, you should do the next one also.

43:13.240 --> 43:15.260
I did have a lot of fun with Boss Baby.

43:16.240 --> 43:18.740
The National Cornbread Festival is coming up next month

43:18.740 --> 43:20.320
and I was thinking of checking it out.

43:20.320 --> 43:21.480
Fuck yeah, why not?

43:21.480 --> 43:22.320
Fuck yeah, I'd go.

43:22.320 --> 43:23.140
Get there.

43:23.140 --> 43:23.980
Why not?

43:23.980 --> 43:26.480
I noticed the words no drones allowed

43:26.480 --> 43:29.480
were written at the bottom of every single page

43:29.480 --> 43:31.120
in bold orange font.

43:31.120 --> 43:32.840
I reached out to the organizers through email

43:32.840 --> 43:34.200
about a week ago.

43:34.200 --> 43:37.320
Bless you, good for you, excellent.

43:37.320 --> 43:38.880
I reached out to the organizers through email

43:38.880 --> 43:40.600
about a week ago, but have not gotten a response

43:40.600 --> 43:42.720
and it doesn't say why they're banned anywhere on the site.

43:42.720 --> 43:43.800
I hope when you reached out to them,

43:43.800 --> 43:46.440
you emailed to say, hey, I know, I get it,

43:46.440 --> 43:48.800
but can I bring one drone?

43:48.800 --> 43:49.640
I'll be cool.

43:50.840 --> 43:52.200
Just the one drone.

43:53.120 --> 43:54.120
Oh man.

43:54.120 --> 43:55.760
It doesn't say anywhere.

43:55.760 --> 43:58.320
And so why are drones banned?

43:58.320 --> 43:59.780
How can I find this out?

43:59.780 --> 44:02.280
Now we've been making a push recently

44:02.280 --> 44:07.280
for more, just to really, you gotta send advice questions.

44:08.660 --> 44:12.440
I, however, have gone to nationalcornbread.com

44:12.440 --> 44:15.320
and have found that really prominently,

44:15.320 --> 44:16.920
at the bottom of every single page,

44:16.920 --> 44:19.440
it does say no drones allowed in huge orange letters

44:19.440 --> 44:20.560
and I don't understand.

44:20.560 --> 44:23.480
It's like, it's really prominent.

44:23.480 --> 44:25.000
The only reason that happens

44:25.000 --> 44:27.320
is if at a past cornbread festival,

44:27.320 --> 44:28.920
they did not have this rule,

44:28.920 --> 44:32.160
some drone showed up and ruined everything.

44:33.080 --> 44:37.040
Yeah, I mean, man, it's really just on the masthead there.

44:37.040 --> 44:39.280
It's above their address.

44:39.280 --> 44:40.240
Yeah, it's above their address.

44:40.240 --> 44:41.760
If you can imagine this, friend,

44:41.760 --> 44:43.480
if you're not at a computer,

44:43.480 --> 44:45.640
at the bottom of the page, there's like the links

44:45.640 --> 44:47.640
for Facebook and Twitter and Instagram.

44:47.640 --> 44:50.760
Boy, I bet the Instagram of National Cornbread Festival

44:50.760 --> 44:51.880
just kind of bookmarked that.

44:51.880 --> 44:53.520
Click away.

44:53.520 --> 44:55.060
Oh shit.

44:55.060 --> 44:57.040
It's a bunch of cornbread up on here.

44:57.040 --> 44:59.540
It looks real good.

44:59.540 --> 45:02.000
Yeah, it looks actually really delicious.

45:02.000 --> 45:02.840
Now that I'm looking.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.420
And then at the bottom of the page,

45:04.420 --> 45:06.480
there's like their address in white

45:06.480 --> 45:09.320
and then above that, in three times as big font,

45:09.320 --> 45:14.320
in huge orange letters, it says no drones allowed, so.

45:14.520 --> 45:17.800
Did the website maybe used to be something else

45:17.800 --> 45:19.840
and then they updated every part of it

45:19.840 --> 45:22.440
but couldn't figure out how to remove no drones allowed

45:22.440 --> 45:23.280
from the masthead?

45:23.280 --> 45:25.520
No drones allowed.

45:25.520 --> 45:27.400
Do you think, do drones eat?

45:27.400 --> 45:29.560
Oh, okay, I got Brad Garrett to do that too.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.120
I got Brad Garrett to say no drones allowed.

45:31.120 --> 45:33.600
Do drones eat cornbread?

45:33.600 --> 45:36.760
They do like it, but like,

45:36.760 --> 45:38.960
do they like it more than the rest of us?

45:38.960 --> 45:39.800
I don't know.

45:39.800 --> 45:42.520
I'm just saying, listen, if I worked hard to make some,

45:42.520 --> 45:44.760
and I'm hoping to like win the blue ribbon,

45:44.760 --> 45:47.600
make some like award-winning cornbread, right?

45:47.600 --> 45:50.120
And then a drone swoops in and eats it all up

45:50.120 --> 45:52.080
before judgment again, what am I supposed to,

45:52.080 --> 45:54.240
how am I supposed to stop a drone, Griffin?

45:54.240 --> 45:56.920
Now I will say there's, let's Occam's Razor this

45:56.920 --> 45:58.080
because what's more likely?

45:58.080 --> 46:00.160
Drones love to eat and enjoy and digest

46:00.160 --> 46:02.600
and then I guess shit cornbread?

46:02.600 --> 46:05.620
Or at the National Cornbread Festival

46:05.620 --> 46:10.620
in South Pittsburgh, Tennessee, there was executed

46:10.960 --> 46:12.640
the fucking heist of the century,

46:14.680 --> 46:19.040
an aerial cornbread escape and nary a flake

46:19.040 --> 46:22.920
of this sweet yellow bread crossed the gums

46:22.920 --> 46:26.600
of the attendees and participants of the festival

46:26.600 --> 46:29.400
as they lifted off into the skies.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.880
And they even did the thing that they do

46:30.880 --> 46:33.280
at the Super Bowl sometimes where it'll form words

46:33.280 --> 46:38.080
like Maroon 5 or Pepsi Good.

46:38.080 --> 46:42.080
And it said like, fuck yous, this, you know,

46:42.080 --> 46:43.220
biscuits are where it's at

46:43.220 --> 46:45.040
from the National Biscuit Council, eat our ass.

46:45.040 --> 46:47.400
Whoa, it was a spite thing?

46:47.400 --> 46:48.720
It's possible. I love that.

46:48.720 --> 46:50.360
I thought it was good, I thought you were headed

46:50.360 --> 46:52.800
towards like, you know, a super villain

46:52.800 --> 46:55.320
who has like a crazy craving for some cornbread

46:55.320 --> 46:57.980
and they've stolen like 5,000 pounds of cornbread

46:57.980 --> 47:01.040
right under the nose of that cornbread festival

47:01.040 --> 47:02.480
who's always thwarting them.

47:02.480 --> 47:03.320
Yeah.

47:04.840 --> 47:08.920
And another possibility is that if you see the way

47:08.920 --> 47:12.640
that the tents are lined up and the parking lots

47:12.640 --> 47:15.880
are lined up and the corn maze is lined up,

47:15.880 --> 47:19.800
the whole thing when seen from way above Bird's Eye View,

47:19.800 --> 47:21.000
and this is just an accident,

47:21.000 --> 47:22.680
it's just kind of how it came together,

47:22.680 --> 47:26.120
it does look like a dog sitting on its butt

47:26.120 --> 47:30.880
with a huge boner and they don't want anyone to know

47:30.880 --> 47:33.080
and it's too late to change it.

47:33.080 --> 47:35.360
Do you think maybe the organizers

47:35.360 --> 47:37.200
of the cornbread festival are worried

47:37.200 --> 47:40.040
that people would show up just like super excited

47:40.040 --> 47:42.280
for cornbread and then they'd look up and be like,

47:42.280 --> 47:45.200
oh shit, are those robots flying in the sky?

47:45.200 --> 47:46.440
Yeah, fuck cornbread.

47:46.440 --> 47:48.440
I wanna find out about this.

47:48.440 --> 47:50.680
Yeah, that's way more interesting.

47:50.680 --> 47:52.600
I'm going to Skybot Festival.

47:52.600 --> 47:54.040
So it should list some other things

47:54.040 --> 47:56.000
that are more interesting than cornbread,

47:56.000 --> 47:59.600
like yo-yos or bread.

47:59.600 --> 48:01.560
Pencils, paper.

48:01.560 --> 48:04.800
There's so many pictures on the cornbread festival website

48:04.800 --> 48:07.120
of people pretending to be super jazzed

48:07.120 --> 48:08.440
about the idea of cornbread.

48:08.440 --> 48:10.440
Tell me you're wrong, I love cornbread,

48:10.440 --> 48:12.920
but these people, it is as if they have never

48:12.920 --> 48:14.880
eaten food before.

48:14.880 --> 48:17.720
I kind of really want to go now.

48:17.720 --> 48:18.560
I tweeted at them.

48:18.560 --> 48:19.880
I see that Justin has now tweeted,

48:19.880 --> 48:22.040
hey, our drone's allowed at the cornbread festival

48:22.040 --> 48:24.240
to the cornbread festival.

48:24.240 --> 48:25.080
And that's always.

48:25.080 --> 48:28.080
And then I just follow up with that afterwards with just one

48:28.080 --> 48:29.840
because I want to make it clear, I don't want to bring

48:29.840 --> 48:31.440
a lot of drones, just the one drone.

48:31.440 --> 48:34.960
Sure, and this is a fun thing that Justin likes to do

48:34.960 --> 48:37.520
to Twitter accounts with 600 followers

48:37.520 --> 48:40.560
is sort of just sort of bring the hammer down on them.

48:40.560 --> 48:41.640
A joke hammer.

48:41.640 --> 48:43.040
How about a Yahoo?

48:43.040 --> 48:44.800
Yeah, I'd love that, thank you.

48:44.800 --> 48:49.800
So here's one that was sent in by Jessica Williams.

48:50.160 --> 48:51.640
Thank you, Jessica.

48:51.640 --> 48:54.080
It is from Yahoo Answers user.

48:54.080 --> 48:55.240
Oh, they are anonymous.

48:55.240 --> 49:00.240
So I'm gonna call them Sally.

49:00.240 --> 49:05.240
Sally asks, was I right to leave the party

49:05.520 --> 49:07.960
because there was nowhere for me to sit?

49:09.000 --> 49:11.400
Yesterday, my grandma had a party at her house.

49:11.400 --> 49:14.120
My whole family went and extended family too.

49:14.120 --> 49:17.320
It started at like 10 a.m. and I got there at 12 p.m.

49:17.320 --> 49:19.920
I drove there to find there were no seats.

49:19.920 --> 49:22.000
I walked in the backyard and everyone was sitting down

49:22.000 --> 49:24.360
and I got offended because no one offered me a seat.

49:24.360 --> 49:27.080
I would have had to stand up the whole time

49:27.080 --> 49:28.520
so I got in my car and left.

49:28.520 --> 49:29.760
Was I right to do that?

49:29.760 --> 49:31.360
Now the whole family is talking about me

49:31.360 --> 49:32.360
and thinks I'm weird.

49:33.360 --> 49:36.240
Here's the thing that Sally wasn't,

49:37.120 --> 49:39.280
isn't telling us, it's not her family.

49:40.200 --> 49:41.840
Oh, I see.

49:41.840 --> 49:44.520
She showed up and everyone's like, oh, she's back.

49:44.520 --> 49:46.320
And she's like, no one's giving me a seat

49:46.320 --> 49:49.200
and she left and everyone was super relieved.

49:49.200 --> 49:54.200
Yeah, also Sally is a baby black bear

49:54.840 --> 49:57.000
who just keeps coming onto my lot

49:57.000 --> 49:59.480
and keeps falling in my swimming pool

49:59.480 --> 50:03.040
and scaring my child a lot.

50:03.040 --> 50:03.880
That's possible.

50:03.880 --> 50:05.720
It could also be that you showed up two hours late

50:05.720 --> 50:07.640
to your grandma's radical party

50:07.640 --> 50:10.600
and so maybe you just don't get a seat.

50:10.600 --> 50:12.520
How long was grandma's party going

50:12.520 --> 50:15.480
that two hours was an acceptable window to you?

50:15.480 --> 50:19.240
Did grandma put 10 a.m. to question mark?

50:19.240 --> 50:20.280
You're at it all day.

50:20.280 --> 50:23.640
Now if it's a Memorial Day thing in Ironton,

50:23.640 --> 50:26.800
that's kind of a come and go situation.

50:26.800 --> 50:29.520
Because you're gonna be going to all the neighbor's houses.

50:29.520 --> 50:32.200
Yes, especially if it's on the parade route.

50:32.200 --> 50:34.160
Oh, forget about it.

50:34.160 --> 50:36.400
Especially if you've got an easily accessible bathroom,

50:36.400 --> 50:37.960
people are gonna be hitting you up all day long.

50:37.960 --> 50:39.840
Hey Bill, it's Steve.

50:39.840 --> 50:41.600
Yeah, whatever, where's the crap?

50:41.600 --> 50:43.120
Of course.

50:43.120 --> 50:44.600
Love it, so good catching up.

50:44.600 --> 50:46.120
I gotta shoot the dick real quick.

50:46.120 --> 50:47.000
Thank you for your service.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.480
I never actually, can I shit in here?

50:50.600 --> 50:52.100
That's a closet, okay.

50:53.500 --> 50:57.320
This would be, generally speaking,

50:57.320 --> 50:58.580
is it okay to leave a party

50:58.580 --> 51:00.880
because there's nowhere for you to sit?

51:00.880 --> 51:04.520
I certainly, in my collegiate days,

51:04.520 --> 51:08.200
before I learned how to speak to other human beings,

51:08.200 --> 51:12.640
I left parties for far less reasonable reasons

51:12.640 --> 51:14.080
than this reason.

51:14.080 --> 51:15.920
Like too drunk reason.

51:15.920 --> 51:19.240
Too drunk or someone showed up who looked like someone

51:19.240 --> 51:21.840
that I have beef with, but it didn't end up to be them.

51:21.840 --> 51:23.360
There were drones there,

51:23.360 --> 51:26.240
or you thought you heard an ice cream truck.

51:26.240 --> 51:27.240
You thought you heard an ice cream truck,

51:27.240 --> 51:29.320
you gotta chase that shit down.

51:29.320 --> 51:31.160
Gotta see what's happening out there.

51:31.160 --> 51:34.360
I think that rather than tell someone,

51:34.360 --> 51:35.880
like if someone's like, hey Sally,

51:35.880 --> 51:36.720
why'd you leave the party?

51:36.720 --> 51:38.680
Don't say there weren't enough seats there.

51:38.680 --> 51:42.360
Say, I knew there were more seats somewhere else.

51:42.360 --> 51:45.440
That's what put a positive spin on it.

51:45.440 --> 51:46.760
I'm still at the party.

51:46.760 --> 51:48.600
I'm just sitting down at my house.

51:48.600 --> 51:51.640
Now I have annexed my house as part of your party

51:51.640 --> 51:53.960
because that's where I knew the seat was.

51:53.960 --> 51:56.240
What if you told him you went to buy more chairs,

51:56.240 --> 51:59.120
but the chair store had burned down so you went home

51:59.120 --> 52:01.720
because it was very far away from the original party.

52:01.720 --> 52:03.080
You can do what I do whenever I show up

52:03.080 --> 52:05.920
to any social function, which is walk into the room

52:05.920 --> 52:08.000
and introduce my presence,

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
and then just very, very slowly start sitting down

52:13.400 --> 52:17.680
wherever I am and hope that somebody puts a chair under me.

52:17.680 --> 52:19.800
And I make a big deal out of it like, oh.

52:19.800 --> 52:20.640
How often does that work?

52:20.640 --> 52:24.280
Oh no, here I go, gonna,

52:24.280 --> 52:28.360
I hope I don't smash my tuchus on the ground.

52:28.360 --> 52:31.320
Someone please give me a thing to land.

52:31.320 --> 52:35.000
Oh no, I'm almost losing my balance thinking my tuchus.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.560
Now Griffin, you have broken your coccyx like 80 times,

52:38.560 --> 52:39.800
right?

52:39.800 --> 52:42.960
I don't, it's really just kind of a metal,

52:42.960 --> 52:45.440
it's kind of mostly just a truck hitch

52:45.440 --> 52:47.560
back there at this point.

52:47.560 --> 52:48.800
Which is cool because I can.

52:48.800 --> 52:50.160
Yeah, you can pull a trailer.

52:50.160 --> 52:55.120
Yeah, I can get a boat down to the river just on myself.

52:55.120 --> 52:56.260
Which is exciting.

52:57.560 --> 53:02.060
I would leave the party because I don't wanna stand up

53:02.060 --> 53:03.880
while a bunch of sitters in the same way

53:03.880 --> 53:06.560
that I do not wanna be the only person sitting at the party

53:06.560 --> 53:09.740
talking to a bunch of pizones.

53:09.740 --> 53:13.600
I would find some place lower to sit down.

53:13.600 --> 53:14.440
Oh.

53:14.440 --> 53:16.000
Like if everybody's sitting on a chair,

53:16.000 --> 53:18.280
you could sit on like a footstool.

53:18.280 --> 53:19.120
You know what I mean?

53:19.120 --> 53:21.600
So now it's like, I'm even more comfortable than you are.

53:21.600 --> 53:23.720
Damn Trav, that's funky and relatable.

53:23.720 --> 53:24.640
Thank you.

53:24.640 --> 53:26.320
Twisted too, I'd say.

53:26.320 --> 53:28.360
Thank you, well that's just what I bring to the party.

53:28.360 --> 53:31.840
Get a shovel and start digging a hole you can sit in.

53:31.840 --> 53:33.720
Yeah, do that.

53:33.720 --> 53:34.560
The lowest one is the-

53:34.560 --> 53:36.840
Or just lay down and look up at your grandma.

53:36.840 --> 53:40.160
The lowest, the lower you are, the cooler you are.

53:40.160 --> 53:41.000
Yes.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.040
Because you're closer to the center of the earth

53:42.040 --> 53:44.280
where it's hot, baby.

53:44.280 --> 53:46.840
And maybe just grab the whole bowl of potato salad

53:46.840 --> 53:47.920
and pop a fork in there.

53:47.920 --> 53:49.120
No need for a plate.

53:50.000 --> 53:50.880
Yeah, don't leave.

53:50.880 --> 53:52.440
That's not gonna get even with them.

53:52.440 --> 53:54.700
These motherfuckers wanna be chair hogs.

53:56.240 --> 54:00.880
I think you gotta just upend the hot dog tray.

54:00.880 --> 54:03.120
I think a good way to get a bunch of people standing up

54:03.120 --> 54:05.280
who are sitting is just walk in and say,

54:05.280 --> 54:07.120
oh, sitting, huh?

54:07.120 --> 54:09.280
And then just don't say anything else

54:09.280 --> 54:11.320
as you look around the room slowly.

54:12.400 --> 54:13.440
That would work on me.

54:13.440 --> 54:14.720
I'd be like, wait, what is it?

54:14.720 --> 54:16.240
What's wrong with, oh.

54:16.240 --> 54:17.080
That's wrong with sitting?

54:17.080 --> 54:18.240
Yeah, that's really bad for you.

54:18.240 --> 54:19.840
I heard that sitting for five minutes

54:19.840 --> 54:21.360
is like having 30 heart attacks.

54:21.360 --> 54:22.200
Whoa.

54:22.200 --> 54:23.280
Is what I saw on the news.

54:23.280 --> 54:24.440
Yeah.

54:24.440 --> 54:25.280
I'm a stander.

54:25.280 --> 54:27.040
The problem is is then once people start standing up

54:27.040 --> 54:30.040
with you, you can't then sit down like,

54:30.040 --> 54:31.880
oh, you know what, I'm gonna risk it.

54:31.880 --> 54:34.220
I read another story.

54:34.220 --> 54:36.140
They've updated, the science has changed.

54:36.140 --> 54:37.500
You know science.

54:37.500 --> 54:39.540
The science on sitting is different now.

54:39.540 --> 54:42.340
Oh, you know what I love when confronted

54:42.340 --> 54:46.020
with my grandma in her rude chair stealing ways

54:46.020 --> 54:48.940
is you get a whoopee cushion under there.

54:48.940 --> 54:51.200
Oh my god, this sounds so funny.

54:51.200 --> 54:52.260
Nobody talk.

54:52.260 --> 54:53.900
Well, you gotta blow it up first

54:53.900 --> 54:56.060
and you don't wanna see them to see you do that.

54:56.060 --> 54:58.660
So go in the bathroom and say, I've got a shit,

54:58.660 --> 54:59.780
and then you go in the bathroom

54:59.780 --> 55:01.780
and you blow up a whoopee cushion.

55:01.780 --> 55:05.660
But do make it seem like you're actually doing the deed

55:05.660 --> 55:06.860
because they're gonna be like,

55:06.860 --> 55:09.020
what are you doing in there blowing up a whoopee cushion?

55:09.020 --> 55:11.580
And so roll the toilet paper roll a few times

55:11.580 --> 55:13.640
and tear a piece off so that they think.

55:13.640 --> 55:15.540
Spend some time praying loudly.

55:15.540 --> 55:18.100
Well, no, I'm talking about usual bathroom stuff.

55:18.100 --> 55:22.220
And so you flush it down and wash your hands good,

55:22.220 --> 55:24.180
but you don't have to, you can just turn the water on.

55:24.180 --> 55:25.780
And really you can do that anywhere,

55:25.780 --> 55:27.980
but that's a whole different pro tip.

55:27.980 --> 55:29.140
And then you're gonna go outside

55:29.140 --> 55:30.420
and everybody's sitting in the chairs.

55:30.420 --> 55:33.420
At this point, the whoopee cushion's in your belly

55:33.420 --> 55:36.940
up in your shirt, and you're gonna walk out.

55:36.940 --> 55:38.380
And you better do it to grandma

55:38.380 --> 55:39.700
because it's gonna be the funniest,

55:39.700 --> 55:43.180
like it's funnier when an older person passes gas.

55:43.180 --> 55:45.020
Yes, yes, yes.

55:45.020 --> 55:47.220
You are gonna go stand behind them

55:47.220 --> 55:50.220
or maybe crawl behind them so everybody else doesn't see you.

55:50.220 --> 55:52.840
And once you get there,

55:52.840 --> 55:54.980
you're gonna have to get that whoopee cushion

55:54.980 --> 55:58.020
under granny's behind.

55:58.020 --> 56:00.540
Yes, this is the part of your plan

56:00.540 --> 56:03.860
I'm most interested in, if I'm being honest.

56:03.860 --> 56:05.260
Sure, sure, sure.

56:05.260 --> 56:07.100
So we're talking about what is a whoopee cushion?

56:07.100 --> 56:09.660
Well, I'm glad you asked me that very question.

56:09.660 --> 56:12.760
It's just a bag full of air, and what is air known for?

56:12.760 --> 56:16.220
It can fill any space that it occupies.

56:16.220 --> 56:20.380
And so if you just put it sort of against your granny's thigh

56:20.380 --> 56:23.460
and the chair, the surface,

56:23.460 --> 56:25.660
and you just kind of start pushing

56:25.660 --> 56:28.780
that big balloon against her hiney,

56:28.780 --> 56:31.820
it's gonna get under there eventually.

56:31.820 --> 56:35.660
The question is what is there distracting her

56:35.660 --> 56:37.060
against this very obvious sensation?

56:37.060 --> 56:37.880
That's the obvious question.

56:37.880 --> 56:40.820
I know you think I'm a real goofball by suggesting this.

56:40.820 --> 56:42.380
Another thing you need in this situation

56:42.380 --> 56:44.620
is a pill caddy full of bees.

56:44.620 --> 56:48.340
Okay, yes, a pill caddy full of bees.

56:48.340 --> 56:49.620
Yeah, and you're just gonna start

56:49.620 --> 56:50.820
opening those up one by one.

56:50.820 --> 56:53.100
And once they start getting bored with one bee,

56:53.100 --> 56:57.060
you open up Tuesday bee, Wednesday bee, Thursday bee.

56:58.260 --> 57:00.980
Wait a minute, why not just have, sorry, I'm sorry.

57:00.980 --> 57:03.640
Why not then just have a box of bees?

57:04.780 --> 57:06.820
Because it's harder to catch a box full of bees.

57:06.820 --> 57:08.580
If you open up a box, Travis.

57:08.580 --> 57:10.860
Thank you, yes.

57:10.860 --> 57:13.820
Even a small box, like a box for shoes,

57:13.820 --> 57:16.860
and then fucking seven bees fly out,

57:16.860 --> 57:19.580
people will be like, that was not.

57:19.580 --> 57:20.740
Not impressive.

57:20.740 --> 57:24.340
But if you throw a pill caddy for one week down,

57:24.340 --> 57:26.860
and you then walk over to what you've just thrown down,

57:26.860 --> 57:29.180
and one by one open all the doors.

57:29.180 --> 57:31.140
It does heighten the scare factor

57:31.140 --> 57:32.540
because people will look at it and think,

57:32.540 --> 57:34.540
oh my God, that's a week's worth of bees.

57:34.540 --> 57:36.500
That's so many.

57:36.500 --> 57:39.600
So you would open one bee, right, at least one bee,

57:39.600 --> 57:42.660
then you would go and scoot some more of the cushion

57:42.660 --> 57:43.540
underneath Grandma.

57:43.540 --> 57:44.820
Oh no, people are getting bored.

57:44.820 --> 57:48.100
You go back out to the center room, open Monday bee,

57:48.100 --> 57:49.700
and then you go back more cushion.

57:49.700 --> 57:52.620
Exactly, the problem is that you've chosen a target

57:52.620 --> 57:56.540
who is maybe the least mobile person at the event,

57:56.540 --> 57:58.640
and so you need to confront yourself with the reality

57:58.640 --> 58:01.980
that this thing, this dog just is not going to hunt,

58:01.980 --> 58:04.640
even, no matter if you have something ridiculous,

58:04.640 --> 58:07.620
like two full pill caddies full of bees.

58:07.620 --> 58:10.180
And so at that point, your granny's gonna catch you,

58:10.180 --> 58:12.780
and it'll do the funny exclamation point thing

58:12.780 --> 58:15.220
like in Metal Gear Solid, and she'll be like,

58:15.220 --> 58:16.260
what do you do?

58:16.260 --> 58:17.620
She'll be like, what do you do?

58:17.620 --> 58:20.140
And then that's when you just take the whoopee cushion back

58:20.140 --> 58:23.660
and you just squeeze it so that the little rubber lips

58:23.660 --> 58:28.420
of it is blowing the fart like at her derriere.

58:28.420 --> 58:31.560
And that's gonna be not ideal, obviously,

58:31.560 --> 58:34.040
but you get something out of it, so.

58:34.040 --> 58:36.540
My only sadness is that you've edited all this out

58:36.540 --> 58:38.740
and no one will ever get to hear any of this madness.

58:38.740 --> 58:40.660
That's the only thing that makes me sad.

58:40.660 --> 58:43.020
No, I think that one made the cut.

58:43.020 --> 58:43.860
It did.

58:43.860 --> 58:44.680
Oh, that one's in there.

58:44.680 --> 58:46.100
Wow, I'm actually surprised.

58:46.100 --> 58:47.380
Can we talk about the max phone drive?

58:47.380 --> 58:48.500
Sure, I guess so.

58:48.500 --> 58:49.460
Is that okay?

58:49.460 --> 58:52.380
Yeah, maximumfund.org forward slash donate is the address.

58:52.380 --> 58:56.020
If you could donate five, 10, $20 a month,

58:56.020 --> 58:59.460
at $20 a month, you get a puzzle and a pin of your choice

58:59.460 --> 59:00.700
and all the bonus content.

59:00.700 --> 59:04.180
$35 a month, you get an engraved mug

59:05.100 --> 59:08.980
and the puzzle and the pin and the bonus content.

59:08.980 --> 59:11.140
That engraving, by the way, as I should have mentioned,

59:11.140 --> 59:12.420
you don't get to pick the engraving.

59:12.420 --> 59:13.740
It's the max funnel logo.

59:13.740 --> 59:14.700
But it's cool.

59:14.700 --> 59:16.420
Like, that's a cool thing to have on your mug.

59:16.420 --> 59:18.460
The Arby's, the Arby's logo.

59:18.460 --> 59:19.820
I love that.

59:19.820 --> 59:22.440
There are more gifts at higher donation levels,

59:22.440 --> 59:25.420
which you can go see at the website if you want to.

59:25.420 --> 59:27.860
But the main thing is just subscribing.

59:28.900 --> 59:31.340
Even if it's just five bucks a month,

59:31.340 --> 59:36.200
it really does add up and help to keep this network going.

59:36.200 --> 59:37.660
It is the reason that we have all been able

59:37.660 --> 59:41.980
to make this our jobs, spend a lot more time on the shows,

59:41.980 --> 59:45.460
improve our equipment, and-

59:45.460 --> 59:47.020
And start new shows.

59:47.020 --> 59:47.860
Start new shows, yeah.

59:47.860 --> 59:49.260
We started with Just My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

59:49.260 --> 59:50.340
And look how many we're doing now

59:50.340 --> 59:53.380
because being a part of this network is so great.

59:53.380 --> 59:57.040
Yeah, it is a great place to do our thing.

59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.020
And we are very fortunate

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.340
that you all have been so supportive in the past.

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:05.360
So think about, it's really quick too.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.900
Go to maximumfund.org slash donate.

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.760
It takes like just like a minute to pick your show

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.660
you want to support and get all your stuff in there.

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.800
I want to say my, let me also encourage you.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.740
If you're thinking about doing it and you want to do it,

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:17.580
do it now.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.160
Like as long as you're not driving or something,

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.760
if you can safely like get on your phone

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.140
or computer or whatever, because, you know,

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.020
it's so easy to say like, oh yeah, I'll do that later.

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:26.620
And then like you completely forget about it.

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:27.880
And then you're going to miss your window

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.900
to get all of these awesome rewards

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.380
and to be part of the drive and all that stuff.

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.100
I would say also for whatever it's worth,

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.180
and I don't want to like get into gilding anybody,

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:38.220
but for the first couple of days,

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:40.180
we had some problems with the Max Fund website.

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:43.600
And speaking frankly, we're a little bit behind

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.740
of where we would like to be.

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:48.260
Considering the network-wide goal is 25,000

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.420
and we're sitting at about eight here

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.660
as we're recording on Friday afternoon.

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:55.260
Hopefully it's slightly higher than 8,000,

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:57.020
which is what it's at currently on Friday,

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:57.980
because you're listening to this on Monday.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.180
But we would really appreciate it.

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.960
We need your help basically is what I'm saying.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.640
So if you would come to leap to our aid,

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.800
like a brave, cool night, we would really appreciate it.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.620
And please don't hesitate.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.380
Maximumfund.org forward slash donate.

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:14.740
If you like the stuff we do

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:16.740
and you want more stuff like that in the world,

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.780
this is how you vote for that stuff.

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.980
That's how you fill the world with things you like.

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:21.820
So please.

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:23.220
And thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.060
for these for our theme song.

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:26.740
And to Departure, ask the album putting the days to bed.

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:27.980
How about a yahoo?

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.500
Oh, one more thing before I forget.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.560
We have a YouTube channel, McElroy Family on YouTube.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.640
And we've been doing a bunch of like live streams

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.620
and extra stuff on there.

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:37.860
Maybe by the time this comes out,

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:41.480
I'll have posted, Teresa did like a retro hair tutorial

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.660
on there.

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:43.500
Go check it out.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.460
And we will probably do some more live streams on there.

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:49.000
So McElroy Family on YouTube.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.720
This final yahoo was sent in by Teresa.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.180
Thanks Teresa.

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.820
My wife?

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:54.780
Please Travis.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:56.780
My wife.

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:59.180
This yahoo answers user Kate, who asks,

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:03.340
how do you describe an elephant taking a dump

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:05.760
in a funny yet serious way?

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:12.760
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.060

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:18.740
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.
