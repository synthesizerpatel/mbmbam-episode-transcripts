00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.360
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

00:47.360 --> 00:52.880
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.880 --> 00:59.040
I'm Griffin. I'm fucking steamed, gang. I'm fucking sacked off today,

00:59.040 --> 01:03.360
this morning finds me PO'd. This is interesting energy

01:03.360 --> 01:05.760
to bring to our comedy advice show, Griffin. Well, what am I supposed to do?

01:05.760 --> 01:10.960
I'm this pissed-tickled, Trav. I'm this frustrated and pissed-tickled.

01:12.320 --> 01:16.240
Just my world's fucking falling apart, Trav, and so I'm really pissed off.

01:19.200 --> 01:24.320
Why is that? Because of all the really bad stuff that's happening in the world and all the people

01:24.320 --> 01:29.600
that are in danger. Pissed off and ticked on I am because of the, you all saw it, right?

01:29.600 --> 01:34.560
You all saw it, and it was just a fucking nudge, wasn't it? It was just a little nudge.

01:34.560 --> 01:41.200
It was a little kiss. Griffin, are you talking about how the Notre Dame?

01:41.200 --> 01:46.000
I'm not talking about my- No, that's covered by all the trillionaires who have nothing better

01:46.000 --> 01:51.280
to do. I'm talking about these beautiful beasts, these beautiful Kentucky beasts,

01:51.280 --> 01:55.360
and then they bumped. That got me really pissed off, what happened because of that. Justin,

01:55.360 --> 01:59.760
did you hear about this shit? I am so tired of Griffin telling me how over

01:59.760 --> 02:05.760
he is talking about horses, and then he gallops back on the show with another equine-

02:05.760 --> 02:09.120
This isn't even about me talking shit. This isn't about Goose About Horses,

02:09.120 --> 02:16.160
Justin. This is about the gosh dang sport. I did read about it. I just skimmed it. I

02:16.160 --> 02:21.360
didn't really de-breed it, but it's something about one horse would have won, but it humped

02:21.360 --> 02:27.440
another one. It wasn't even a hump. It was barely a nudge, Travis. Don't be fucking puerile

02:27.440 --> 02:30.960
with your humor when we're talking about something exciting and important as sports.

02:32.640 --> 02:36.080
Griffin, I feel like you might be the only one who knows what you're talking about.

02:36.080 --> 02:44.160
Okay. There's this big horse race that Kentucky does sometimes. Maybe you've heard about it,

02:44.160 --> 02:52.000
the one with the hats. It's the most exciting 90 seconds in sports because these horses get

02:52.000 --> 02:55.680
together and they race, and we make jokes about it every year. This time, the joke's on us,

02:55.680 --> 02:57.920
it feels like, because- Oh, the viewers.

02:57.920 --> 03:02.880
The Maximum Security, which is the horse's name, everybody was like, that's going to win. It's

03:02.880 --> 03:08.080
owned by quote, billionaire philanthropist Gary West. Gary West raises himself a good

03:08.080 --> 03:13.360
motherfucking pony. Maximum Security won the Florida Derby, which is a joke. It's a joke

03:13.360 --> 03:17.680
race that we all like to poke fun at when we're sitting there in our cool hats. Sure enough,

03:17.680 --> 03:23.520
Maximum Security, like a fucking car, like two horses. This guy ran and won the big race,

03:23.520 --> 03:26.560
and then he crossed the finish line, they poured all the milk on his head and poured the milk on

03:26.560 --> 03:30.880
Jockey's head, and everybody was like, yeah. The one who was supposed to win won, and everybody

03:30.880 --> 03:35.200
got a nominal amount of money, except the people who placed stupid bets on weak horses.

03:35.920 --> 03:41.040
Then one of the horses was like, hey, to its manager, hey, you should say something. Then

03:41.040 --> 03:45.600
the team behind this horse, named Country House, the worst horse name I've ever heard,

03:46.240 --> 03:48.320
was like- It is a very slow name.

03:48.320 --> 03:54.480
It was like, hey, ref, run back the tapes if you don't mind. Apparently, Maximum Security,

03:56.160 --> 03:59.920
a whiff of skin- Had a lot of fun out there.

03:59.920 --> 04:03.680
Had a lot of fun out there, a whiff of skin, rubbed up against Country House,

04:03.680 --> 04:08.720
they disqualified the fucking horse. Country House was a 65 to one long shot. This horse

04:08.720 --> 04:13.760
is a fucking joke. I could have beaten this horse in a foot race, but it was like, actually,

04:13.760 --> 04:20.000
I got touched. It was in second place, and then it got the win, and then there had to be something

04:20.000 --> 04:23.920
going on because 65 to one, that's so much money if you bet on that one, even though you're wrong

04:23.920 --> 04:25.920
because it lost because it came in second. Super rich.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.560
What were the odds on Maximum Security, Griffin? One to one, it was supposed to win because it

04:30.560 --> 04:37.040
was in prophecy and shit. Then it got kicked out of the race forever for doing that.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.840
Griffin, I want to try to sum up how you're feeling, and you tell me-

04:39.840 --> 04:40.320
Pissed off.

04:40.320 --> 04:41.040
... if you agree with this.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.480
I want to try to encapsulate her. You would say the Kentucky Derby decision was not a good one.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.120
I don't think it was a good decision overall.

04:49.680 --> 04:54.880
You would say it was a rough and tumble race on a wet and sloppy track,

04:54.880 --> 04:56.080
actually a beautiful thing to watch.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.320
Yeah, I think that's how I would encapsulate most-

04:58.320 --> 05:01.680
So you're agreeing with that. You would also say that only in these days of political

05:01.680 --> 05:05.920
correctness could such an overturn occur. The best horse did not win the Kentucky Derby,

05:05.920 --> 05:07.600
not even close? I would say factually,

05:07.600 --> 05:09.280
statistically, yes, all that tracks.

05:10.160 --> 05:16.240
Okay, so this entire tweet, you're completely on board with whoever tweeted it.

05:16.240 --> 05:24.560
You're probably like, no, that one was our cool president, Donald Trump.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.320
So you, on this one-

05:26.880 --> 05:28.000
You won and won.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.120
Just like the odds for Maximum Security.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.160
Just listen.

05:32.160 --> 05:36.800
Two parallel light cycles, Griffin and Donald Trump agree.

05:36.800 --> 05:40.240
Two parallel light cycles screaming towards the wall.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.120
Listen, and if they touch, the blue one's out.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.840
It's the whole point of the light cycles is to make them bump.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.400
Listen, fucking, rubbing is racing.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.880
These horses are going to touch out there on a sloppy course.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.240
I don't understand, like, I disagree with everything else he's ever said,

05:54.240 --> 05:56.240
but this is factual.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.120
I'll take this to its logical conclusion though,

05:59.120 --> 06:02.560
well, you're like, if one horse was running and stabbed another horse,

06:02.560 --> 06:03.760
would you disqualify it?

06:03.760 --> 06:06.080
Well, that happened, of course, in the 1996 Derby

06:06.080 --> 06:07.760
when Murder Boy lived up to his name.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.360
Yes, of course.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.920
And do you think he should have been disqualified for that?

06:11.920 --> 06:13.920
No, they did book the jockey on that one,

06:13.920 --> 06:16.240
which is good because he was really goading him along.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.440
That was the right decision.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.640
But the jockey didn't do the stabbing?

06:18.640 --> 06:22.000
No, but he was accomplice, and everybody knows horses can be led,

06:22.000 --> 06:23.280
you can't lead a horse to water,

06:23.280 --> 06:24.960
but you can make it murder somebody

06:24.960 --> 06:27.440
if you say the magic spell in its ear on the racetrack.

06:27.440 --> 06:32.640
The thing that irritated me about the president's cold tweet

06:32.640 --> 06:37.200
is he said the best horse did not win the Kentucky Derby.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.240
Not even close.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.920
I would say, considering the second place horse

06:41.920 --> 06:45.040
was then awarded the victory, he was in fact close.

06:46.480 --> 06:49.200
He was way closer than any of the other horses,

06:49.200 --> 06:52.400
so much so that he was the second place finisher in that race.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.560
I would also argue that the best horse won

06:54.560 --> 06:57.440
and then got disqualified, which is very close.

06:57.440 --> 06:57.840
That's pretty close.

06:57.840 --> 07:01.840
So in either way, the best horse was very close to winning,

07:01.840 --> 07:03.200
either way you look at it.

07:03.200 --> 07:07.360
I can't believe they did the Kentucky Derby on yesterday.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.960
It was free comic book day, May the 4th,

07:10.960 --> 07:14.160
and also Kentucky Derby, like nerdgasm.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.280
Yeah, sure, man.

07:15.280 --> 07:15.840
You know what I mean?

07:15.840 --> 07:17.360
You know what I also find weird?

07:17.360 --> 07:19.360
That it's kind of like a speakeasy thing

07:19.360 --> 07:21.840
where they never publicize the Kentucky, it just happens.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.480
And if you're not looking, you'll miss it.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.920
Yeah, no one knew it was happening

07:25.920 --> 07:28.000
until the horses were like halfway around.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.640
Here's a quote from Bill Mott, who's country house's trainer,

07:30.640 --> 07:32.240
that lucky son of a gun.

07:32.240 --> 07:37.280
Bill Mott says, you know, here's the thing about the liberals,

07:37.280 --> 07:39.600
because I am one, but don't they stink, guys?

07:39.600 --> 07:39.840
Yeah.

07:40.560 --> 07:40.880
Cool.

07:41.520 --> 07:46.240
No, Bill Mott says, with regards to Luis Saez,

07:46.240 --> 07:49.760
who was the jockey on maximum security,

07:49.760 --> 07:52.320
the most powerful and wonderful horse that ever lived on this earth,

07:53.360 --> 07:56.800
and he said of Saez, I think the horse did this on his own.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.760
I don't think Luis Saez did anything intentionally.

07:59.760 --> 08:00.560
He's a friend of mine.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.280
He rides with me.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.880
My heart actually aches for them.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.720
I've been on the other end of this plenty of times,

08:04.720 --> 08:06.720
just not in the Kentucky Derby.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.680
Eat my whole asshole, Bill Mott.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.680
You know, Bill Mott's like, thanks, Luis.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.360
I don't give a fuck what happened.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.160
I got the money.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.040
I got the money.

08:15.040 --> 08:18.000
My horse's nuts are now worth a billion dollars a piece.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.200
Everything kicks ass.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.760
This horse, the other horse is going to die tonight,

08:21.760 --> 08:25.040
and that's on me and my good friend Luis Saez,

08:25.040 --> 08:27.760
who I did pay $100,000 to kick the other horse

08:27.760 --> 08:29.760
like he's playing fucking Road Rash.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.400
Horses are dumb, but I don't think they're so dumb

08:32.400 --> 08:36.640
that they'd be in a race and they'd be debating blasting,

08:36.640 --> 08:38.640
side blasting one of their compatriots.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.880
It's like, I want to win so bad,

08:40.880 --> 08:42.400
I want to side blast this other horse

08:42.400 --> 08:45.200
so I get executed in the parking lot tonight.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.240
Not only that, but-

08:46.240 --> 08:47.360
That's so worth it to me.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.680
If you think it's the horse's fault,

08:49.680 --> 08:50.960
you shouldn't punish that horse.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.000
It's a horse.

08:52.000 --> 08:52.720
It's a horse.

08:52.720 --> 08:53.840
It's no horse's fault.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.200
It has to be.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.960
It doesn't know what the fuck it's doing.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.160
It has to be.

08:58.160 --> 09:01.280
Moments in my life, anything that happens out there

09:01.280 --> 09:04.320
has to be the human being, all the horse's fault.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.920
There's no, the horse got to go play.

09:07.920 --> 09:08.720
It depends, right?

09:08.720 --> 09:10.080
We're talking about nature versus nurture.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.440
You grow up in the fields, it's like,

09:11.440 --> 09:13.840
oh man, it's all about just being free.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.160
And if we find some wild oats, hell yeah.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.400
But when you grow up in this environment

09:18.400 --> 09:20.480
with somebody every day yelling at you,

09:20.480 --> 09:22.320
rubbing is racing, rubbing is racing.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.880
Get out there and trade some paint, motherfucker.

09:24.880 --> 09:29.120
Then these, of course they're going to just push on the field.

09:29.120 --> 09:32.800
But again, again though, not the horse.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.400
Like, this person is offloading blame

09:36.400 --> 09:38.560
from the jockey to the horse.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.280
It's like, the horse has no, the horse is no horse.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.240
The jockey's one job is control the horse.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.600
Yeah, don't let the horse blast other horses.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.920
Don't let him side blast another horse.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.360
Hey, side blasting.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.920
Keep on moving forward, not side to side.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.360
Not side to side.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.200
You lose valuable time that way

09:57.200 --> 09:59.600
if you're side blasting your enemies.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.600
If you wanted to make the Kentucky Derby fun and watchable.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.160
Yeah.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.920
I make it about 40 seconds in every year.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.680
I'm like, which way is the bar?

10:07.680 --> 10:08.800
Yeah, too long.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.400
Too long, a minute and a half, come on.

10:10.400 --> 10:14.160
Which weapon would you give East Jockey

10:14.880 --> 10:17.680
to make the Kentucky Derby better?

10:17.680 --> 10:19.200
Only jockey to jockey violence, right?

10:19.200 --> 10:20.720
I don't want to see no jockeys hurting horses.

10:20.720 --> 10:21.280
Well, more than that.

10:21.280 --> 10:21.760
No, no, no.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.280
Jockey to jockey violence, right?

10:24.320 --> 10:25.360
I would say a net.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.480
A net seems fun.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.160
I think what would be cool is if instead of weapons,

10:31.200 --> 10:36.640
you just, what is there, like 30 horses in this fucking race?

10:36.640 --> 10:39.520
Take 15 of them at the starting line

10:39.520 --> 10:42.080
and you turn them 180 degrees.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.160
And now we go.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.880
And hopefully on pretty much the complete opposite side

10:46.880 --> 10:52.800
of the track, there's going to be a sort of collision field.

10:52.800 --> 10:53.280
A sort of collision-

10:53.280 --> 10:54.640
Kind of a bob and weave, yeah.

10:54.640 --> 10:55.840
Sort of a collision zone.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.600
Every half lap, we're going to end up

10:57.600 --> 10:59.760
entering to the collision zone

10:59.760 --> 11:02.160
and you really need to sort of get around that.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.760
And I think it's just last horse standing.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.600
What about this, tinier horses?

11:07.600 --> 11:11.280
That you would, no, explain.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.320
Explain that.

11:12.320 --> 11:15.440
It's the same exact race, but like miniature horse

11:16.800 --> 11:18.480
instead of full-size horses.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.000
I would watch the hell out of it.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.800
Give me like 12 little Sebastians out there.

11:22.800 --> 11:23.040
Yeah.

11:23.040 --> 11:23.760
Forget about it.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.200
I'm watching the hell out of that.

11:25.200 --> 11:29.200
We could do 29 little horses and one big powerful horse.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.640
And one Clydesdale.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.200
That's got a mighty, mighty hunger.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.320
That can only be satisfied in one dark way.

11:36.320 --> 11:36.880
Okay.

11:36.880 --> 11:40.880
Instead of 30 horses, in the same space, 300 horses.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.880
300 horses is really good, Trav.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.280
I was actually going to suggest that

11:45.280 --> 11:46.800
when Griffin asked how many horses there were,

11:46.800 --> 11:49.200
I thought he was going to like quintuple it

11:49.200 --> 11:51.280
and just let it get out there and team.

11:51.280 --> 11:51.520
Yeah.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.760
What would be tight is if the track was made out of

11:53.760 --> 11:56.000
just slick stainless steel

11:56.000 --> 11:58.720
and then it sort of sloped inward.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.800
Like it sloped towards the center of the track

12:00.800 --> 12:03.440
so it would collect all the good horse grease

12:03.440 --> 12:07.840
that would be generated by these 300 beautiful animals

12:07.840 --> 12:10.240
just walking all over each other.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.800
Just catch all that grease in a pan in the middle

12:12.800 --> 12:15.680
and then the winner gets to eat it for power.

12:15.680 --> 12:16.720
Check this idea out.

12:16.720 --> 12:17.680
One island.

12:17.680 --> 12:18.160
Okay.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.200
400 oats.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.600
Some horses.

12:21.600 --> 12:21.920
Uh-huh.

12:22.640 --> 12:23.360
Race it out.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.200
Race island.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.000
Race island.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.120
I'm telling you, man, if you really want to sell race island,

12:29.120 --> 12:32.000
you've got to get the word horse in the title.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.800
Really?

12:34.800 --> 12:35.680
Race island.

12:35.680 --> 12:36.640
A horse show.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.000
This fall on ABC.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.120
A horse endeavor.

12:45.760 --> 12:46.560
Race island.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.840
A father horse mystery.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.440
The horse is a priest.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.280
Race war.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.480
A horsey story.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.160
Oh wait, it's actually getting worse.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.080
Race island.

12:58.080 --> 12:58.800
Race island.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.840
Helicopters.

12:59.840 --> 13:00.880
It's horses though.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.760
Yeah, but we watch them with the helicopters.

13:04.320 --> 13:07.200
How about 30 horses, one of them's a robot,

13:07.200 --> 13:09.120
and we're not going to tell you which.

13:09.120 --> 13:09.520
All right.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.480
The twist is, they're all robots.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.720
God, that was a lot of horse work we just did there.

13:14.720 --> 13:15.520
Good work, boys.

13:16.080 --> 13:16.880
You begged for it.

13:16.880 --> 13:17.280
Still got it.

13:17.280 --> 13:18.240
You wanted it so bad.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.680
I mean Griffin, not you the listener.

13:21.680 --> 13:22.560
You didn't ask for any of that.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.000
They've been begging for it too.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.680
I'm a part-time artist, part-time nanny.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.840
I like to combine these talents and get money for

13:29.840 --> 13:32.720
them by offering private art classes to youth.

13:32.720 --> 13:37.120
My biggest worry is getting stuck with a kid who I have nothing in common with, or just a bummer.

13:37.120 --> 13:41.680
How do I set up a screening process to make sure I only had to teach cool kids

13:41.680 --> 13:44.640
without them or their parents realizing they are being screened?

13:44.640 --> 13:46.720
That's from an awfully awkward artist.

13:47.280 --> 13:53.520
This is like a backwards Mr. Holland's opus that I really enjoy.

13:53.520 --> 13:56.560
It's Mr. Holland's nopus, and I really like it a lot.

13:56.560 --> 14:02.080
Listen, if I was going to stand and deliver it, I don't want to get halfway through the semester

14:02.080 --> 14:04.080
and be like, no, you know what?

14:04.080 --> 14:05.760
I can't help you.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.040
I thought I could.

14:07.040 --> 14:10.960
I thought you were cool, but it turns out you suck shit.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.160
Get out of here.

14:12.160 --> 14:19.760
Isn't it better to teach a kid to do art and he'll be underemployed his entire life.

14:20.400 --> 14:23.680
Teach a kid to hang and he can chill forever.

14:23.680 --> 14:24.800
Think about that for a second.

14:24.800 --> 14:29.840
Teach a kid to hang art and he might become a docent or something somewhere.

14:29.840 --> 14:30.560
That's a job.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.440
Now that's a job.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.080
That there's a job.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.520
That there's a job that can never be done by a machine.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.400
No, no.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.360
Hanging art?

14:37.360 --> 14:38.240
No, no, no.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.680
You need a human touch for that.

14:39.680 --> 14:40.400
You need a human.

14:42.720 --> 14:47.360
You could dress yourself up like a big child and then see if they bully you.

14:47.920 --> 14:51.520
And then if they ride off on their skateboard after doing so, you're like, okay,

14:51.520 --> 14:54.640
okay, that seems like a popular and I could be with that.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.600
Like you really beg for it.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.920
You wear like a secondhand elf t-shirt.

15:05.920 --> 15:06.400
Yeah.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.320
Yeah, maybe you walk in and you fall down.

15:10.800 --> 15:15.520
And you have like a chocolate pudding stain on the back of your shirt.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.080
Yeah, like shit.

15:16.640 --> 15:17.120
Like shit.

15:17.760 --> 15:19.760
Get fucking back into me bullying.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.880
And if they don't say anything or if they're like, let's get you to the bathroom and clean it.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.080
Let's find a teacher.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.280
And you're like, ah, damn it.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.120
You're not the chosen one.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.560
I wanted to, the kid in the corner who yelled, is that shit?

15:32.560 --> 15:33.680
Everyone look.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.160
I've got to find out his parents, who they are.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.240
And if they are interested in enriching his mind with artistic endeavors.

15:40.240 --> 15:50.480
I think it is more fun if you can sort of make the kid be cool.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.640
Make the kid be someone who is in common with you.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.640
That wasn't a good sentence, but I think you got the point of what I was trying to say.

15:57.280 --> 15:58.480
I actually didn't.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.840
No, me neither.

15:59.840 --> 16:03.040
If the kid's not in common with you, get them there.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.560
Wait, what does that mean?

16:04.560 --> 16:05.920
That one's even worse.

16:05.920 --> 16:08.160
Yeah, so first of all, those glasses have got to go.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.520
Oh, wait, are you She's All That-ing this kid?

16:11.520 --> 16:17.040
I think that's, I'm doing a sort of Mr. Holland's All That sort of situation.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.360
Uh-huh, okay.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.880
Mr. Holland gets his groove back.

16:21.840 --> 16:25.920
And boy, I wish I'd seen that movie so I could generate some good jokes here.

16:25.920 --> 16:28.480
But just kind of like, you know what that movie's about.

16:28.480 --> 16:32.320
And it's the things about it that would be funny to poke jokes about.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.400
So you go ahead and do that yourself, thanks.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.200
I mean, you tell the kid you need to buy some weed, right?

16:37.200 --> 16:38.160
I mean, that's how you-

16:40.960 --> 16:47.040
That's a dangerous gambit, Justin, because if the kid's not cool, you just lost your job.

16:47.040 --> 16:52.320
Whatever, if the kid tells you he's a fucking narc, you didn't want him anyway.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.040
They can't fire you for telling them that their kid's a narc.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.320
Yeah, they can't fire you.

16:56.320 --> 16:56.800
You quit.

16:57.760 --> 16:58.320
Hold on.

16:59.760 --> 17:00.240
What's up?

17:00.240 --> 17:01.760
Listen, it's not my fault.

17:01.760 --> 17:02.960
I thought your kid was cool.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.880
I think you need to re-evaluate your parenting decisions.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.720
They don't work for a firm.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.640
There's not like a service sending them out.

17:10.640 --> 17:14.720
They're an independent contractor who wants to buy some weed.

17:14.720 --> 17:21.360
Is it weird if you request headshots of them wearing what they think is their coolest t-shirt?

17:22.240 --> 17:22.880
Because that's gonna-

17:24.000 --> 17:27.280
That'll be a good sort of rubric for you to grade these children.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.640
Headshots are good.

17:28.640 --> 17:32.480
Headshots are good, but if they just dress up in their Sunday best, nuh-uh.

17:32.480 --> 17:40.480
If they dress up wearing a sports t-shirt or an athlete's jersey, then yes, come on in.

17:40.480 --> 17:45.120
Well, but I think you might also need maybe just like a hundred word essay on the back

17:45.120 --> 17:47.280
explaining why the shirt is cool.

17:47.280 --> 17:53.200
Because like, there is a Garfield t-shirt that I wore unironically when I was like nine, right?

17:53.200 --> 17:53.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:53.600 --> 17:58.560
But if I saw a nine-year-old now wearing that and they were like, this is ironic.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.320
I'd be like, oh, okay.

18:00.320 --> 18:00.560
Yeah.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.000
In there.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.160
But if I saw them and I'd be like, wait, is that ironic or unironic?

18:06.160 --> 18:06.660
Ooh.

18:07.840 --> 18:08.720
I am-

18:09.680 --> 18:11.360
You didn't clarify what kind of artist.

18:11.360 --> 18:15.520
So I'm just gonna assume you're a film director or a director of photography or something.

18:15.520 --> 18:19.600
So all these kids can have a place in your film.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.640
You know, you can ask for headshots.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.240
Tell them you're looking for a bad boy.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.560
If you find the bad boy first out, great.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.720
But if not, then you just find another place to fold them into-

18:30.720 --> 18:34.880
You know, if they're giving off kind of a wimpy non-energy,

18:34.880 --> 18:38.960
maybe they're like behind the bar by the cool kid that you eventually find,

18:38.960 --> 18:42.480
and they get like pulled over the bar and like shot as a beer bottle on their face

18:42.480 --> 18:43.600
or something like that.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.480
There's a part for every kid in your film that you're making.

18:46.480 --> 18:46.980
Yeah.

18:47.280 --> 18:54.240
I'm just saying, if they're wearing a Darth Maul t-shirt, you might be your redneck.

18:54.240 --> 19:00.560
But if you're wearing a t-shirt with a badass picture of Dave Navarro on it-

19:02.160 --> 19:06.160
What if you're wearing a Darth Maul t-shirt, but Darth Maul is dressed like Dave Navarro?

19:06.160 --> 19:10.640
What if you're wearing a Darth Maul t-shirt and you are Dave Navarro?

19:10.640 --> 19:12.720
I'm short circuiting over here, boys.

19:12.720 --> 19:16.480
We should make a Darth Navarro t-shirt and see who sues us,

19:16.480 --> 19:20.160
because I am curious who would get there first.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.440
I got a Yahoo, can I read it?

19:22.240 --> 19:22.740
Sure.

19:22.740 --> 19:24.580
This one was sent in by Austin.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.220
Thanks, Austin.

19:25.220 --> 19:29.060
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call Dave, who asks,

19:30.740 --> 19:33.940
How do I make it seem like I need protein powder for school?

19:35.060 --> 19:38.340
My dad gave me his credit card and told me to order school supplies.

19:38.340 --> 19:41.540
I accidentally ordered over a gallon of protein powder

19:41.540 --> 19:44.740
because I had put it in my shopping cart as a joke.

19:44.740 --> 19:47.460
What school-related thing can I tell my dad it's for?

19:47.460 --> 19:48.580
It was $70.

19:48.580 --> 19:50.580
$70.

19:52.980 --> 19:55.220
Let's talk about this funny fucking joke first.

19:56.020 --> 19:59.300
Was somebody watching you order school supplies on Amazon?

19:59.300 --> 20:01.460
Because that's a weird show for them to be taking in.

20:01.460 --> 20:04.580
Or was it just a little, what if I did get yoked?

20:04.580 --> 20:07.060
I'm just going to add it as a little goof for myself.

20:07.060 --> 20:11.780
And I think we all know that you wanted to get completely jacked up, ripped up, and yoked.

20:11.780 --> 20:14.180
And there's no shame in that, but don't call it a joke.

20:14.180 --> 20:14.980
Call it a secret.

20:14.980 --> 20:23.620
Protein powder is expensive, especially if you're getting some pure, dope, keto-friendly shit.

20:23.620 --> 20:28.820
Like the real dope fucking shit that's not just ground-up turkey.

20:28.820 --> 20:33.460
Because a lot of protein powders these days are dried-up ground-up turkey.

20:34.020 --> 20:36.180
And they'll flavor it with chocolate or vanilla,

20:36.180 --> 20:39.060
but I know the truth that it's just ground-up turkey.

20:39.620 --> 20:43.700
I want the ones with weird mushrooms in them that's going to freak my muscles out.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.260
Yes, isolates, right?

20:46.260 --> 20:46.580
Yeah.

20:46.580 --> 20:47.380
Thank you.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.220
I wanted to get really crazy in there.

20:49.220 --> 20:53.540
I saw fucking Rob Lowe hawking Adkins.

20:54.260 --> 20:54.980
And he was like-

20:54.980 --> 20:56.500
Just like on a street corner?

20:56.500 --> 20:57.620
No, on a commercial.

20:57.620 --> 21:00.980
He's like, this is the shit that works for me.

21:00.980 --> 21:08.740
And he's like, I have basically, Rob, lived in your guest house for the past 25 years of your life.

21:08.740 --> 21:10.420
You have never needed this.

21:10.420 --> 21:12.100
You cannot keep anything from me.

21:12.100 --> 21:15.940
I followed you from West Wayne to Dr. Vegas and back.

21:15.940 --> 21:18.740
Like you have never needed this program.

21:18.740 --> 21:20.180
I call bullshit on you, Rob.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.020
Robert, if you prefer.

21:22.740 --> 21:23.540
So why-

21:23.540 --> 21:24.740
He prefers Bob Lowe.

21:24.740 --> 21:26.260
He prefers bobbles.

21:26.260 --> 21:31.700
What are we going to say to this guy's dad, though, about this being a vital school supply?

21:32.900 --> 21:33.460
Travis has it.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.020
Travis has it.

21:34.020 --> 21:34.740
Travis has it.

21:34.740 --> 21:38.980
Tell him you have a super yoked teacher who hates apples,

21:38.980 --> 21:43.700
and this is what you're going to put on his desk day one to ensure straight A's.

21:44.260 --> 21:45.300
That's good.

21:46.020 --> 21:47.300
That's good.

21:48.340 --> 21:55.940
My teacher of philosophy is star of station screen and the WWE superstar Dave Bautista.

21:56.580 --> 21:59.860
And he loves teaching me about Immanuel Kant,

22:00.340 --> 22:04.900
but when he gets an apple, he throws it back at the child that gave it to him as hard as he possibly can.

22:04.900 --> 22:07.460
Now, if I give him this, it'll appease him like an angry god.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.660
An angry god, and I feel like I'm going to get a lot out of him.

22:10.660 --> 22:17.220
Dave Bautista, aka Trunchable, hates apples and kids, and will throw an apple through a kid.

22:17.220 --> 22:18.740
Loves Groot, loves Groot.

22:18.740 --> 22:19.540
Loves Groot.

22:19.540 --> 22:20.420
Loves Groot.

22:20.420 --> 22:21.540
Loves Groot.

22:21.540 --> 22:27.620
But if I give him this protein powder, then I'm the Bautista, then I'm baby Bautista.

22:27.620 --> 22:32.180
Remake Matilda with Bautista's Trunchable.

22:32.180 --> 22:32.660
Thank you.

22:32.660 --> 22:33.780
Do it, cowards.

22:33.780 --> 22:34.820
Thank you.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.340
It's 2019.

22:36.340 --> 22:38.660
Cast Dave Bautista as Trunchable.

22:38.660 --> 22:40.500
It's 2020.

22:40.500 --> 22:43.460
Cast Dave Bautista as Matilda and call it Bautilda.

22:44.420 --> 22:46.740
Cast Dave Bautista as every part in the movie.

22:46.740 --> 22:47.220
Oh my god.

22:47.220 --> 22:47.620
A one-hander.

22:47.620 --> 22:52.500
Bautista as Trunchable, Bautista as Matilda in theaters 2020.

22:52.500 --> 22:52.900
Yes.

22:52.900 --> 22:54.180
This is a film.

22:54.180 --> 22:54.900
Now we're back.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.420
Now we're back.

22:56.420 --> 22:59.380
Miss fucking Trunchable tries to piledrive Miss Honey.

22:59.380 --> 23:01.220
Miss Honey reverses it.

23:01.220 --> 23:02.420
Piledrives to Miss Trunchable.

23:02.420 --> 23:04.340
She breaks her neck, dies in the first 10 minutes of the movie.

23:04.340 --> 23:06.420
Cast The Rock as Miss Honey.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.140
Cast what other big boys are there?

23:09.140 --> 23:14.740
Get Vin Diesel in there as Danny DeVito's character, Mr. Matilda.

23:15.460 --> 23:16.500
I have a problem.

23:16.500 --> 23:17.000
Fight!

23:17.780 --> 23:22.180
Haters, I want you to imagine something.

23:22.180 --> 23:27.220
A tri-fold construction paper display.

23:28.340 --> 23:32.180
And you know how it's always like, what causes volcanoes?

23:32.180 --> 23:34.660
Or like, is coal really the future?

23:35.460 --> 23:37.620
Is coal really the future?

23:37.620 --> 23:39.300
Is coal really the future?

23:40.020 --> 23:40.900
But how about this?

23:40.900 --> 23:44.820
What if you saw a project that just said on construction paper letters,

23:44.820 --> 23:46.020
how jacked is Dylan?

23:49.060 --> 23:53.220
Your science fair project is like, how jacked am I getting right now?

23:53.220 --> 23:56.100
It's just you under a sheet, and when the judges walk by,

23:56.100 --> 23:58.180
you throw out the sheet and yell, real jacked!

23:59.060 --> 24:00.580
I'm extremely jacked is the answer.

24:00.580 --> 24:02.260
And then when the teacher comes by and is like, all right,

24:02.260 --> 24:05.060
so tell me everything about the science details of your project.

24:05.060 --> 24:10.740
And you're like, well, protein is an element that gets you totally wild strong,

24:10.740 --> 24:15.860
and if you mix it up with these mushrooms, which is the middle of the food pyramid,

24:15.860 --> 24:19.780
then it makes your pecs go absolutely crazy in there.

24:19.780 --> 24:24.980
So my name's Dylan, and I'll take my A plus now, or else you're going in the chokie.

24:26.340 --> 24:27.460
I can put you there.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.780
I can put you there with my huge body.

24:29.780 --> 24:31.940
Now, eat this whole cake.

24:31.940 --> 24:34.100
Eat this whole cake, Batista.

24:36.740 --> 24:40.340
I want to watch damn Batista eat a whole cake, please!

24:40.340 --> 24:43.140
I have a very specific website for you, Trapp.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.540
Let's send that right along.

24:45.540 --> 24:49.540
I got a handful of WWE superstars in my employ, and let's just say,

24:50.420 --> 24:54.100
the tables have turned on Mr. Goldust, who recently announced his retirement,

24:54.100 --> 24:58.660
and let's just say, he's coming to me for his lunch these days.

24:58.660 --> 25:00.500
And is his lunch a whole cake?

25:00.500 --> 25:01.780
It's a whole cake, yeah.

25:01.780 --> 25:03.540
And I have him locked up on my roof.

25:03.540 --> 25:05.380
I feed him like a carrier pigeon.

25:05.380 --> 25:06.900
A whole cake?

25:06.900 --> 25:07.620
Yeah.

25:07.620 --> 25:08.740
I have another question.

25:08.740 --> 25:09.220
Yep.

25:09.220 --> 25:12.020
And I've been having the same problem for years now.

25:12.020 --> 25:13.540
People think I dig up dinosaurs.

25:15.300 --> 25:16.900
It's unrelated.

25:16.900 --> 25:17.300
Sorry.

25:19.540 --> 25:20.500
I'm an archaeologist.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.100
I've been having the same problem for years now.

25:22.100 --> 25:24.580
Incontinence and efficiency in my writing.

25:24.580 --> 25:28.660
I put in extraneous details, like my career, whenever I ask the right questions

25:28.660 --> 25:29.460
about incontinence.

25:30.020 --> 25:31.060
Okay, I'm an archaeologist.

25:31.060 --> 25:32.500
I've been having the same problem for years now.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.580
People just think I dig up dinosaurs.

25:34.580 --> 25:38.900
Recently doing my masters in osteoarchaeology has just made this worse,

25:38.900 --> 25:43.140
because when I say I work with bones, they say, oh, like dinosaurs?

25:43.140 --> 25:46.580
How do I let people know that archaeology has nothing to do with dinosaurs,

25:46.580 --> 25:48.980
and I dig up people and not plesiosaurs?

25:49.460 --> 25:52.580
That's from Phalacius in the Cretaceous.

25:52.580 --> 25:54.180
Great.

25:54.180 --> 25:54.660
Yes.

25:54.660 --> 25:56.660
There were a lot of difficult words in there, Justin.

25:56.660 --> 25:57.060
You did great.

25:57.060 --> 25:58.740
You did a fucking great job, bud.

25:58.740 --> 25:59.140
Thank you.

25:59.140 --> 26:03.620
I started feeling pretty good around osteoarchaeology,

26:03.620 --> 26:06.900
but I didn't want to say anything, because I knew I'd fuck up, like, lit.

26:06.900 --> 26:07.140
Yeah.

26:07.140 --> 26:08.660
Yeah, you were afraid you'd jinx it.

26:08.660 --> 26:09.060
Yeah.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.860
I mean, I wouldn't just assume you dig up dinosaurs.

26:11.860 --> 26:14.740
I would think that you obviously do dig up a lot of dinosaurs,

26:14.740 --> 26:16.260
and that's maybe 95% of your work,

26:16.260 --> 26:21.060
but the other 5% of your work is fighting with Nazis on conveyor belts

26:21.060 --> 26:22.820
and squishing them down into a rock tumbler.

26:23.460 --> 26:25.060
Something along those lines.

26:25.060 --> 26:28.260
I would say that if you're an archaeologist, right, you're doing some digging.

26:28.260 --> 26:28.900
I am.

26:28.900 --> 26:31.140
You might accidentally find a dinosaur.

26:31.140 --> 26:32.580
Maybe it's not what you're looking for,

26:33.140 --> 26:37.380
but it's not like if you found a dinosaur, you just throw it away, you know?

26:37.380 --> 26:42.100
If you're looking for, I don't know, dead humans or clay pots or whatever,

26:42.100 --> 26:46.180
and you find a Tyrannosaurus Rex, you'd probably still keep it, right?

26:46.180 --> 26:48.100
So if you are in an area...

26:48.100 --> 26:48.740
Hold on.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.260
Stop the podcast.

26:50.260 --> 26:54.500
If you're in an area where you assume there to be human remains,

26:54.500 --> 26:58.660
and you instead found dinosaur remains among the human remains,

26:58.660 --> 27:01.220
things have gone terribly wrong.

27:01.860 --> 27:06.420
Well, I mean, the other option, Justin, is every time an archaeologist digs for something,

27:06.420 --> 27:08.740
it is where it's supposed to be and they find it.

27:08.740 --> 27:13.220
And I would say my scenario is more likely than your scenario.

27:13.220 --> 27:13.860
You?

27:13.860 --> 27:16.180
But like, what you're saying is insane.

27:16.180 --> 27:16.820
What?

27:16.820 --> 27:19.140
Like, think about the layers of the earth.

27:19.140 --> 27:20.580
And we found dinosaurs.

27:20.580 --> 27:22.900
Oh, it looks like all dinosaurs were Egyptians.

27:23.460 --> 27:27.860
No, I'm not saying like, if you dig down five feet, right?

27:27.860 --> 27:29.540
And find some old bones.

27:29.540 --> 27:32.980
Then someone has buried a body there and you're not dealing with archaeology.

27:32.980 --> 27:34.260
You're dealing with murder.

27:34.900 --> 27:35.220
Right.

27:35.220 --> 27:35.780
Okay.

27:35.780 --> 27:36.820
Say 50 feet.

27:36.820 --> 27:37.700
Whatever.

27:37.700 --> 27:40.340
It's not like if you went a few miles west,

27:40.340 --> 27:43.940
there would instead be dinosaur bones at that exact depth.

27:43.940 --> 27:47.460
I could go outside and die on top of where a dinosaur is.

27:47.460 --> 27:50.660
And then 100 years from now, somebody find my bones and they're like,

27:50.660 --> 27:52.020
well, let's keep on pushing.

27:52.020 --> 27:55.780
And in the same way, I'm sure this person when they're digging and they find dinosaur bones,

27:55.780 --> 28:00.100
they're probably like, well, let's excavate the stomach because maybe it ate a person

28:00.100 --> 28:04.020
and we can find them inside there somewhere and then get a double.

28:04.020 --> 28:07.380
I am just making the case that I don't think you find human remains

28:07.380 --> 28:09.380
and dinosaur bones at the same depth.

28:09.380 --> 28:10.340
Not at the same depth.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.340
But once you find one thing, you don't stop digging.

28:12.340 --> 28:14.020
You're not just like, ah, femur.

28:14.020 --> 28:14.500
Cool.

28:14.500 --> 28:15.780
Quitting time.

28:15.780 --> 28:17.700
Like you do the whole area.

28:17.700 --> 28:22.660
I don't think you say like, well, we've had a very good day of unearthing clay pots.

28:22.660 --> 28:26.900
I'm going to dig another 100 miles under the ground and see what I dig up.

28:26.900 --> 28:30.660
But I'm saying you might accidentally find a dinosaur next to you.

28:30.660 --> 28:32.260
You go 100 feet to the left.

28:32.260 --> 28:33.700
There's some dinosaurs.

28:33.700 --> 28:39.300
If the wind sweeps through the desert plains that you're doing your work in

28:39.300 --> 28:45.300
and on your way back to the site, there's a whole unearthed Tyrannosaurus rex.

28:45.300 --> 28:48.580
You're not going to be like, ah, the bones are so big.

28:48.580 --> 28:52.980
Let's just keep going to where we intended to dig up some boring ass human bones

28:52.980 --> 28:54.820
and they've only got like 50 bones.

28:54.820 --> 28:57.780
And this T-Rex has like a thousand huge radical bones.

28:58.340 --> 28:58.580
Right.

28:59.620 --> 29:00.100
Yes.

29:00.100 --> 29:01.140
Thank you, Griffin.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.780
I'm just saying, I guess my thesis is that dinosaur bones

29:03.780 --> 29:06.580
are better than our bones in every imaginable way.

29:06.580 --> 29:08.500
They're way bigger and there's more of them.

29:08.500 --> 29:11.540
And this person, I want to fix this person's problem.

29:12.100 --> 29:12.740
Okay.

29:12.740 --> 29:16.420
No, I'm saying like, I'm redirecting your energies away from arguing with me.

29:16.420 --> 29:16.900
Okay.

29:16.900 --> 29:19.380
Because none of us know anything about what we're talking about.

29:19.380 --> 29:20.500
I've seen the Flintstones.

29:21.060 --> 29:21.540
Okay.

29:21.540 --> 29:25.940
I've seen bones and there's bones literally everywhere, Justin.

29:25.940 --> 29:27.060
Do you think that when a bird is-

29:27.060 --> 29:28.100
Justin, I've got it.

29:28.100 --> 29:28.740
I've got it.

29:28.740 --> 29:32.820
100 years from now, 2000 years from now, someone's excavating a museum.

29:32.820 --> 29:36.180
They find dinosaur bones and human bones right next to each other.

29:36.180 --> 29:36.660
What's up?

29:36.660 --> 29:37.060
What's up?

29:37.060 --> 29:37.540
What's up?

29:37.540 --> 29:38.420
What's up?

29:38.420 --> 29:42.500
Do you think what elephant is walking and then they see a person dead on the

29:42.500 --> 29:44.100
ground but they also wanted to die there?

29:44.100 --> 29:47.060
They're like, no, I'll keep walking another 100 feet so our bones don't get mixed up.

29:47.620 --> 29:48.900
So foolish.

29:48.900 --> 29:50.100
It's so foolish what you said.

29:50.740 --> 29:51.060
Okay.

29:51.060 --> 29:56.580
I am, I've found a scientific article here that I'm reading to help with this.

29:56.580 --> 29:56.900
Okay.

29:58.900 --> 29:59.540
What can we do?

29:59.540 --> 30:01.860
If human and dinosaur bones are-

30:01.860 --> 30:02.260
Yes.

30:02.260 --> 30:04.260
If human and dinosaur bones are ever found the same layers,

30:04.260 --> 30:07.220
it would be fascinating to both creationists and evolutionists.

30:07.220 --> 30:10.980
So there's a whole new biblical view of history wouldn't be surprised,

30:10.980 --> 30:13.380
but we consider several logical possibilities,

30:13.380 --> 30:16.660
such as human parties invading dinosaur lands for-

30:16.660 --> 30:16.900
Okay.

30:16.900 --> 30:17.780
Where is this article from?

30:17.780 --> 30:19.460
Can you tell me the source of it?

30:19.460 --> 30:21.380
This is from answersingenesis.org.

30:21.380 --> 30:21.860
I'm sorry.

30:23.860 --> 30:24.980
That's no good, bud.

30:25.540 --> 30:26.180
Okay.

30:26.180 --> 30:26.580
All right.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.100
Sorry.

30:28.100 --> 30:28.260
Yeah.

30:28.260 --> 30:31.860
So I think you just have to keep telling them what your job is

30:31.860 --> 30:33.540
so that future generations don't have to.

30:33.540 --> 30:38.260
I'm sorry you have to bear the weight of it, but it's just tough.

30:38.260 --> 30:38.820
It's just tough.

30:38.820 --> 30:42.260
When I find out you're a bone getter, I immediately go to dinosaurs

30:42.260 --> 30:43.700
because they have the biggest, coolest bones.

30:43.700 --> 30:46.580
And so just let me live in that fantasy because I don't have much else.

30:46.580 --> 30:48.180
The Indiana Jones thing could help, though.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.700
That's where my mind goes.

30:49.700 --> 30:51.940
You never saw Indy digging up bones.

30:52.660 --> 30:55.860
So that's what an archaeologist does, whatever Indiana Jones does.

30:55.860 --> 30:58.660
I'm pretty sure he finds some people bones at some point.

30:58.660 --> 31:03.060
I'm pretty sure he makes some people bones with his gun he has.

31:03.060 --> 31:05.460
Do you have a fucking gun?

31:05.460 --> 31:07.380
Because I want to know that.

31:08.100 --> 31:08.580
Definitely.

31:08.580 --> 31:09.380
People don't talk about it,

31:09.380 --> 31:13.140
but it's not like Indiana Jones is in highly trafficked areas.

31:13.140 --> 31:15.700
If Indiana Jones turns you into a corpse,

31:15.700 --> 31:18.500
that's where you shall remain for the rest of time probably.

31:18.500 --> 31:20.900
He also doesn't have a license to kill.

31:20.900 --> 31:24.020
Like he's not like James Bond, but that fool has-

31:24.020 --> 31:24.660
I know they're-

31:24.660 --> 31:28.100
Listen, I know they're villains and in many cases Nazis, right?

31:28.100 --> 31:28.820
I listen.

31:28.820 --> 31:33.540
I'm glad he killed them, but he has killed a lot of people.

31:33.540 --> 31:34.180
Just a ton.

31:34.180 --> 31:34.740
Like a lot.

31:35.380 --> 31:37.060
Like a metric ton.

31:37.060 --> 31:39.620
Is he sitting there going like, I want to have job security

31:39.620 --> 31:42.820
for archaeologists in the future, so I've got to kill these people now?

31:42.820 --> 31:43.060
Yeah.

31:43.620 --> 31:45.460
He's investing in archaeology future.

31:46.420 --> 31:53.780
Well, I mean, his KD ratio isn't quite as hot as the box full of God's anger or something.

31:53.780 --> 31:56.020
Not really quite sure what happened in that one,

31:56.020 --> 31:57.460
but he sure did get a lot of those fellas.

31:57.460 --> 31:59.380
I think it's just pure uncut God.

31:59.380 --> 32:03.940
He just really got in there and really hurt those men really bad.

32:03.940 --> 32:06.740
I got this one, Indy.

32:06.740 --> 32:07.300
Sit this one.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.660
Save your bullets, pal.

32:08.660 --> 32:09.540
Save your leg.

32:09.540 --> 32:10.180
I got this one.

32:10.180 --> 32:11.540
You got me last time, Indy.

32:11.540 --> 32:12.420
I'll get this one.

32:12.420 --> 32:12.900
Hey, what are you-

32:12.900 --> 32:13.460
Thanks, God.

32:13.460 --> 32:15.540
I can't look at you or else I'll explode, but what are you doing out there?

32:15.540 --> 32:18.580
Well, I'm kind of just shooting through a bunch of the lower rank ones,

32:18.580 --> 32:22.020
but this big important one kind of make his whole fucking face melt.

32:22.020 --> 32:22.260
Wow.

32:22.260 --> 32:22.900
That's cool.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.020
I was just going to shoot him.

32:24.020 --> 32:24.740
No, no, no.

32:24.740 --> 32:25.380
Don't worry about it.

32:25.380 --> 32:25.780
You stay-

32:25.780 --> 32:27.380
No, he's a message to the others.

32:27.380 --> 32:27.780
It's cool.

32:27.780 --> 32:28.180
It's cool.

32:28.180 --> 32:28.580
It's cool.

32:28.580 --> 32:29.220
Don't look though.

32:30.660 --> 32:32.340
It's super cool what I'm doing, but don't look.

32:32.340 --> 32:34.980
Don't look, it's embarrassing. I'm melting this guy.

32:34.980 --> 32:35.620
Okay, you can look.

32:35.620 --> 32:36.420
No, don't.

32:36.420 --> 32:36.660
Don't.

32:36.660 --> 32:37.540
That was a trick.

32:37.540 --> 32:38.180
Okay, bye.

32:38.740 --> 32:39.860
Should we go to the money zone?

32:40.500 --> 32:41.140
I love that.

32:41.140 --> 32:41.700
Let's do it.

32:53.060 --> 32:54.420
Hey, can I tell you about Casper?

32:57.060 --> 33:00.500
I was away from my bed for over a week,

33:00.500 --> 33:02.740
and I hated it.

33:02.740 --> 33:03.700
I mean, I miss my family.

33:03.700 --> 33:04.260
Don't get me wrong.

33:04.260 --> 33:06.580
I miss my wife and my child and everything else,

33:06.580 --> 33:11.060
but my bed called to me from across thousands of miles

33:11.860 --> 33:13.700
because I sleep on a Casper mattress.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.020
And man, after you've slept on a Casper mattress,

33:16.500 --> 33:18.500
nothing else will ever hold up.

33:18.500 --> 33:21.220
It has the benefits of a hybrid collection,

33:21.220 --> 33:22.740
meaning it's elevated lift support,

33:22.740 --> 33:24.820
which increases airflow for cooling,

33:24.820 --> 33:27.860
durability for all body types, and enhanced edge support.

33:27.860 --> 33:29.460
So you don't get that thing like where

33:29.460 --> 33:31.860
you know I flop around a lot while I'm trying to sleep,

33:31.860 --> 33:34.500
and you don't just like the edge of this bed

33:34.500 --> 33:36.580
doesn't just like collapse and you roll off.

33:36.580 --> 33:37.140
Yeah.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.660
It's amazing.

33:38.660 --> 33:40.500
And it's my favorite bed in the world.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.900
I can't imagine sleeping on anything else.

33:42.900 --> 33:43.860
Well, you did.

33:43.860 --> 33:44.660
You just did.

33:44.660 --> 33:45.700
So you have to be able to imagine it.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.860
Yeah, but now that I'm not doing it,

33:47.860 --> 33:49.380
I try to remember it,

33:49.380 --> 33:51.860
and it's just a haze of discomfort and pain.

33:51.860 --> 33:52.360
Okay.

33:52.980 --> 33:55.700
And so you have to check out these new hybrid mattresses.

33:55.700 --> 34:05.300
And when you do, you can get $100 towards select mattresses

34:05.300 --> 34:07.780

34:17.460 --> 34:19.140
Casper.com slash brother.

34:19.140 --> 34:20.500
Use brother at checkout.

34:20.500 --> 34:24.260
It says here, Casper, sleep better, dream wetter.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.420
It doesn't.

34:26.420 --> 34:29.860
It doesn't say that, I'm sure.

34:29.860 --> 34:32.020
Blue Apron also has a tagline,

34:32.020 --> 34:35.460
and it's cook better, sleep wetter.

34:35.460 --> 34:37.060
And they want to give you a box

34:37.060 --> 34:40.100
that has lots of delicious ingredients in it

34:40.100 --> 34:43.380
that you're gonna be able to use alongside this recipe

34:43.380 --> 34:47.460
that is sort of the codex for the produce mystery

34:47.460 --> 34:48.180
that they provide.

34:48.180 --> 34:49.220
It's like an escape room,

34:49.220 --> 34:50.820
but they tell you exactly how to do it.

34:50.820 --> 34:52.180
And then once you get out,

34:52.180 --> 34:54.580
you have like chicken piccata or some shit.

34:54.580 --> 34:56.580
And it is super tasty.

34:56.580 --> 34:57.860
We've all done Blue Apron.

34:57.860 --> 34:59.620
I learned how to cook with Blue Apron.

34:59.620 --> 35:02.100
It's been a lovely experience.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.220
They make cooking at home

35:03.220 --> 35:06.020
a very sustainable part of your weekly routine.

35:06.020 --> 35:08.580
They got like fresh stuff.

35:08.580 --> 35:10.660
They got a bunch of menu options

35:10.660 --> 35:11.700
that you can pick and choose from

35:11.700 --> 35:14.660
that are designed and tested by test kitchen chefs.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.220
They use unique specialty ingredients

35:17.220 --> 35:20.500
to bring the chef quality recipes to your dinner table.

35:20.500 --> 35:21.700
It's a really, really good service.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.060
And right now you can start making

35:23.060 --> 35:24.820
delicious, brag-worthy meals at home

35:24.820 --> 35:27.220

35:27.220 --> 35:28.580
You can check out this week's menu

35:28.580 --> 35:31.380
and get $60 off when you visit blueapron.com

35:31.380 --> 35:32.180

35:32.180 --> 35:34.660
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

35:34.660 --> 35:36.740
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

35:38.740 --> 35:40.260
I'm bailiff Jesse Thorne

35:40.260 --> 35:42.820
and justice is within your reach.

35:42.820 --> 35:45.060
My mom refuses to take my phone calls.

35:45.620 --> 35:47.140
My boyfriend says I should take our cats

35:47.140 --> 35:48.180
with me to graduate school,

35:48.180 --> 35:49.220
but I think he should keep them.

35:49.220 --> 35:51.780
In the court of Judge John Hodgman,

35:52.340 --> 35:53.460
justice rules.

35:54.020 --> 35:55.620
My partner's board game collection

35:55.620 --> 35:57.380
is out of control.

35:58.260 --> 36:00.900
My sister won't stop stealing my clothes.

36:00.900 --> 36:02.340
I'm Judge John Hodgman.

36:02.340 --> 36:03.540
I'm tough, but fair.

36:04.740 --> 36:05.780
I'll bring you justice

36:05.780 --> 36:06.900
and I'm only a click away.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.300
Tipping, automotive etiquette,

36:09.940 --> 36:11.620
siblings, roommates.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.460
If you've got a case,

36:13.460 --> 36:17.060
go to maximumfun.org slash JJHO.

36:17.060 --> 36:19.380
Judge John Hodgman is tough, but fair.

36:19.380 --> 36:20.500
Tough, but fair.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.340
Subscribe to the podcast today.

36:22.900 --> 36:24.260
Judge John Hodgman rules.

36:25.140 --> 36:25.940
That is all.

36:27.060 --> 36:27.940
Would you guys like to enjoy

36:27.940 --> 36:28.820
the Munch Squad segment?

36:30.020 --> 36:30.340
Wow.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.940
What a polite and calm way

36:33.940 --> 36:34.900
of entering the segment.

36:34.900 --> 36:35.460
Yeah, hold on.

36:35.460 --> 36:38.740
No has never been an option because-

36:38.740 --> 36:41.220
Well, in its twilight years,

36:41.220 --> 36:42.980
the Munch Squad wants to be remembered

36:42.980 --> 36:46.100
for being a considerate segment

36:46.100 --> 36:49.460
that tried to make room for the new kids coming up.

36:49.460 --> 36:51.940
Not that his brothers come up

36:51.940 --> 36:52.900
with segments of their own,

36:52.900 --> 36:55.780
but as it sort of dips into the sunset,

36:56.660 --> 36:59.140
it wants to be remembered as a segment

36:59.140 --> 37:01.940
that made room for the new guys coming up.

37:01.940 --> 37:03.460
But the two segments I've done,

37:03.460 --> 37:04.660
everyone hates.

37:04.660 --> 37:05.140
Yeah.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.100
Which ones are they?

37:06.100 --> 37:08.580
That would be Sad Lives and Riddle Me Piss.

37:09.460 --> 37:11.300
Could you try maybe different,

37:11.300 --> 37:12.180
better ones would be-

37:12.180 --> 37:14.900
I'm doing my best.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.500
And for the record,

37:16.500 --> 37:19.700
Riddle Me Piss has a 100% success rate

37:19.700 --> 37:20.900
and it's never died in the vine.

37:20.900 --> 37:21.300
That's true.

37:21.300 --> 37:22.180
And everyone loves.

37:22.180 --> 37:23.860
It's just harder for you to do,

37:24.420 --> 37:25.220
so you don't.

37:25.220 --> 37:25.940
Okay, that's fair.

37:25.940 --> 37:28.740
I'm gonna start doing recaps

37:28.740 --> 37:29.780
of The Good Fight

37:29.780 --> 37:32.180
on the CBS All Access streaming channel

37:33.220 --> 37:36.100
based entirely on guesswork.

37:38.420 --> 37:40.020
And it's called The Good Recap,

37:40.020 --> 37:41.540
and this is something I've been pitching.

37:41.540 --> 37:43.380
And Justin, I guess if you wanna step aside

37:43.380 --> 37:44.900
and let me do The Good Recap,

37:44.900 --> 37:47.060
or are you like dead set on Munch Squad?

37:47.700 --> 37:48.820
No, I got it.

37:50.020 --> 37:50.180
So-

37:54.180 --> 37:55.860
I wish I could do it with strings.

37:55.860 --> 37:58.020
That would be more appropriate in its twilight years.

37:58.020 --> 37:59.140
Oh, like a false-

37:59.140 --> 38:16.580
I want a Munch Squad.

38:16.580 --> 38:20.340
So I have a quick one here

38:20.900 --> 38:22.420
that is very good.

38:23.060 --> 38:24.100
It's a Munch Squad Jr.

38:24.100 --> 38:26.500
Kind of Krispy Kreme is launching

38:26.500 --> 38:28.100
a new fruit-inspired donut lineup

38:28.100 --> 38:31.060
instead of just serving fruit.

38:32.180 --> 38:33.780
Yeah, it's actually amazing

38:33.780 --> 38:35.540
because they have four new donuts

38:35.540 --> 38:37.700
that look, that are shaped

38:38.660 --> 38:40.740
and decorated like fruit.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.500
So there's a strawberry donut

38:44.500 --> 38:47.620
and there's a pineapple donut

38:47.620 --> 38:49.620
and there's a key lime donut,

38:49.620 --> 38:54.260
but they're all, they're donuts, I guess.

38:54.260 --> 38:55.620
But they try to make it look-

38:55.620 --> 38:57.700
So if someone was like looking at you

38:57.700 --> 39:02.180
through the barrel of a sniper rifle,

39:02.180 --> 39:04.980
they're citing you for assassination,

39:04.980 --> 39:06.500
they might think for a moment like,

39:06.500 --> 39:09.220
wait a minute, I think they're eating fruit.

39:09.220 --> 39:11.060
I think we need to call off the hit.

39:11.060 --> 39:12.420
They're turning it around.

39:12.420 --> 39:14.260
I was supposed to kill someone

39:14.260 --> 39:15.540
that was eating a donut,

39:15.540 --> 39:17.060
but this couldn't be them.

39:17.860 --> 39:18.820
Look how healthy they are.

39:18.820 --> 39:21.140
Or alternatively, somebody's looking

39:21.140 --> 39:22.100
for their blind date

39:22.660 --> 39:23.540
and they told them,

39:23.540 --> 39:26.500
I'll be the one eating a big strawberry

39:26.500 --> 39:27.940
the size of my fucking face.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.340
And then maybe a love connection happens.

39:30.340 --> 39:31.780
Maybe it's, and my thing is good

39:31.780 --> 39:33.060
instead of death like yours.

39:33.060 --> 39:34.500
Oh, maybe.

39:35.540 --> 39:39.860
So that's, right now they're doing strawberry.

39:41.060 --> 39:42.740
Get there, just kicked off today.

39:44.820 --> 39:47.140
I think I want to tell you about,

39:49.140 --> 39:51.380
God, I have so many really great ones right now.

39:51.380 --> 39:53.780
McDonald's is doing something new.

39:53.780 --> 39:57.220
They're sunsetting the signature crafted line.

39:58.820 --> 40:00.500
I know, I know, it's really hard.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.180
They were so wet though.

40:02.740 --> 40:04.180
Every one of those I ever ate

40:04.180 --> 40:07.940
was so just sopping wet with too many ingredients.

40:07.940 --> 40:10.260
I love the way it always gooshed out the back.

40:10.260 --> 40:12.900
It gooshed out the back like a guacamole gusher.

40:12.900 --> 40:14.260
I'm heartbroken over here.

40:15.940 --> 40:18.580
So McDonald's is gonna bring

40:18.580 --> 40:21.300
worldwide favorites to the menu.

40:21.300 --> 40:23.060
McDonald's is where you're gonna go

40:23.060 --> 40:24.420
for international cuisine.

40:24.420 --> 40:26.020
It's the next best thing to travel

40:26.580 --> 40:29.060
is just to go over to your local McDonald's.

40:30.500 --> 40:33.060
Some of them have already been tested stateside.

40:36.020 --> 40:40.340
One of the items is called the Grand McExtreme Bacon Burger.

40:40.340 --> 40:42.820
I had one of these in Gay Perry I believe once.

40:43.620 --> 40:46.580
The Grand McExtreme Bacon Burger is from Spain.

40:46.580 --> 40:47.140
Oh, shit.

40:47.140 --> 40:48.580
MC Extreme?

40:49.620 --> 40:50.660
It's a fresh beef.

40:50.660 --> 40:54.820
The McExtreme, like McElroy,

40:54.820 --> 40:57.380
but without the Elroy and add extreme.

40:58.580 --> 41:00.420
The Grand McExtreme Bacon Burger

41:00.420 --> 41:02.260
is a fresh beef quarter pounder

41:02.260 --> 41:04.020
topped with McBacon sauce.

41:04.020 --> 41:04.740
Stop.

41:04.740 --> 41:05.780
Bacon, okay.

41:06.340 --> 41:09.220
Gouda cheese and slivered onions

41:09.220 --> 41:10.820
and that was piloted in Florida.

41:11.940 --> 41:15.380
The Spain of America's southeast.

41:16.740 --> 41:19.860
The Stroopwafel McFlurry features vanilla soft serve

41:19.860 --> 41:21.540
with caramel waffle cookies.

41:21.540 --> 41:22.020
Now hold on.

41:22.020 --> 41:23.700
I know I'll fuck with this.

41:23.700 --> 41:25.140
No, I know you'll fuck with it.

41:25.140 --> 41:25.860
I know you will.

41:26.580 --> 41:28.180
But what about Canada?

41:28.180 --> 41:30.100
The tomato mozzarella chicken sandwich

41:30.100 --> 41:33.540
is a Canadian favorite that comes with tomato and herb sauce

41:33.540 --> 41:36.580
and then there's cheesy bacon fries

41:36.580 --> 41:38.660
that are I guess from Australia.

41:39.540 --> 41:40.580
It's what it says here.

41:42.740 --> 41:46.660
So I don't know why McDonald's,

41:47.220 --> 41:49.460
the thing that was notable about this to me

41:49.460 --> 41:51.940
is this idea that McDonald's would say,

41:51.940 --> 41:53.940
oh, you want to know how they do it in other countries?

41:53.940 --> 41:55.460
Well, we can handle that.

41:55.460 --> 41:58.900
Here's what they have in other places.

41:58.900 --> 42:01.220
But this is the way they're doing it elsewhere.

42:01.220 --> 42:03.700
Do you think that there's the same kind of exchange

42:03.700 --> 42:04.900
back the other way?

42:04.900 --> 42:08.020
Where like if you're like in Australia or Spain or whatever

42:08.020 --> 42:09.300
and you go to McDonald's, you're just like,

42:09.300 --> 42:10.420
yeah, there's a hamburger.

42:10.420 --> 42:12.500
This is, we have this exact,

42:12.500 --> 42:15.780
or wait, is this where McDonald's pizza went?

42:15.780 --> 42:18.420
Has McDonald's pizza been living in Italy this whole time?

42:18.420 --> 42:21.300
That's where, yeah, it can't be in two,

42:21.300 --> 42:24.340
every McDonald's has its own custom menu items, Travis.

42:24.340 --> 42:27.300
I'm glad that we finally got around to the real facts

42:27.300 --> 42:28.020
of the matter.

42:28.020 --> 42:32.020
This would be more akin to if McDonald's Spain

42:33.060 --> 42:34.740
had a paella that they served

42:34.740 --> 42:36.500
and they'd be like, just like in America,

42:37.380 --> 42:38.820
has it, does it there.

42:40.420 --> 42:43.140
I do remember that when McDonald's served bratwurst

42:43.140 --> 42:45.940
and they're like, this is from Germany or whatever.

42:45.940 --> 42:47.540
It's a German hamburger.

42:47.540 --> 42:49.140
It's just they put it in a tube shape.

42:49.140 --> 42:50.420
You don't know, eat it.

42:50.980 --> 42:52.420
You don't know anything, idiot.

42:52.420 --> 42:53.380
You're never leaving.

42:53.380 --> 42:56.180
The McRib is back from Norway, enjoy.

42:56.180 --> 42:58.500
It's like McDonald's is basically betting on people

42:58.500 --> 43:01.860
not leaving the country is the bet

43:01.860 --> 43:03.140
that McDonald's is making here.

43:03.140 --> 43:04.500
Trust us, this is Spain.

43:05.140 --> 43:05.700
This is how Spain does it.

43:05.700 --> 43:06.980
Making extreme bacon burgers.

43:07.940 --> 43:08.900
Can I read a Yahoo?

43:09.940 --> 43:10.420
Yeah, please.

43:10.420 --> 43:12.420
Here is one that was sent in by level9000.

43:12.420 --> 43:14.180
Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport, thank you, Drew.

43:14.180 --> 43:15.780
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

43:15.780 --> 43:18.660
who I'm gonna call.

43:18.660 --> 43:21.860
Kenneth asks, what would surnames be

43:22.420 --> 43:23.940
if they were invented today?

43:24.740 --> 43:27.060
If surnames weren't invented until today,

43:27.060 --> 43:28.100
what would they be?

43:28.100 --> 43:30.020
Like how many people are named after their job?

43:30.020 --> 43:34.660
Would they be like Johnny Vlogger, Susan Office, and so on?

43:34.660 --> 43:35.620
Yes, yes.

43:37.060 --> 43:38.580
Susan Office is not bad.

43:38.580 --> 43:39.780
My job is office.

43:40.420 --> 43:42.020
I'm Gregory Timpson.

43:42.020 --> 43:46.100
Do you think it's weird that all that son stuff is weird, right?

43:46.100 --> 43:47.380
Like John Son?

43:47.380 --> 43:48.420
Yeah, that's what our name is.

43:48.420 --> 43:49.140
Is it the last name?

43:50.260 --> 43:52.260
McElroy means son of, Elroy.

43:52.260 --> 43:55.620
But it's not literally just like Mackelson.

43:56.820 --> 44:00.260
What if we were all called, you know, Daddy Son?

44:00.980 --> 44:03.300
Because we're daddy's three great sons.

44:04.340 --> 44:07.620
Okay, well, I wouldn't mind that.

44:07.620 --> 44:11.780
I think Griffin Daddison is actually not bad.

44:11.780 --> 44:14.500
If surnames were invented today,

44:14.500 --> 44:15.940
I would request that they be,

44:17.060 --> 44:20.580
you choose an animal that you feel best represents you.

44:21.300 --> 44:24.340
And that is how you get your last name.

44:24.340 --> 44:27.460
Imagine if instead of your brother, Justin McElroy,

44:27.460 --> 44:29.540
which we can all agree is a pretty humdrum,

44:29.540 --> 44:31.780
what if I was Justin Tiger Shark?

44:31.780 --> 44:32.420
All right.

44:32.420 --> 44:33.140
Oh, wait, hold on.

44:33.700 --> 44:37.140
Justin, you are telling me, Mr. Tiger Shark, please.

44:37.140 --> 44:38.740
Mr. Tiger Shark, you are telling me

44:38.740 --> 44:40.900
that the animal that best represents you,

44:40.900 --> 44:43.540
the best sums up what it means to be Justin,

44:43.540 --> 44:44.500
is a tiger shark?

44:46.020 --> 44:46.900
Well, not right now.

44:46.900 --> 44:51.300
But if I knew that an animal surname was on the line,

44:51.300 --> 44:52.660
I might try to spice things up a little bit.

44:52.660 --> 44:53.060
Oh, I see.

44:53.060 --> 44:55.220
So it's more of an aspirational reference.

44:55.220 --> 44:55.940
Exactly.

44:55.940 --> 44:59.620
That's every day I want to live in a tiger shark fashion.

45:00.580 --> 45:01.540
I would probably be,

45:01.540 --> 45:03.620
currently I'd probably be Justin Sugar Glider.

45:03.620 --> 45:06.180
I don't know if they upgrade it as they go, but.

45:06.180 --> 45:07.620
This would bring me one step closer

45:07.620 --> 45:10.820
to my eternal dream of being named Griffin Hellbender,

45:10.820 --> 45:12.180
which should be radical.

45:12.180 --> 45:13.300
I think it would be really cool.

45:13.300 --> 45:16.020
I think it would help me get my autobiography

45:16.020 --> 45:19.140
on a few more library shelves.

45:19.140 --> 45:21.860
It would also get me closer to being called Chester Cheetah.

45:22.660 --> 45:23.060
Yep.

45:23.060 --> 45:25.060
Admittedly, I'd have to change my first name to.

45:26.020 --> 45:27.380
Striking Distance, yeah.

45:27.380 --> 45:30.420
But if I could get that second half, I'm halfway there.

45:31.140 --> 45:36.340
But then we also have a lot of sort of long doctor names now.

45:36.340 --> 45:37.300
Yeah.

45:37.300 --> 45:38.660
So it could be like,

45:38.660 --> 45:40.420
and I don't know any of them off the top of my head,

45:40.420 --> 45:42.180
but just imagine I did know like the name

45:42.180 --> 45:43.460
of what a boner doctor would be called.

45:43.460 --> 45:45.460
And so it'd be like Griffin Boner Doctor,

45:45.460 --> 45:48.100
but it would be the doctor's name of its profession.

45:48.100 --> 45:50.180
If we were going to invent surnames now,

45:50.180 --> 45:51.220
I think it would be like,

45:51.220 --> 45:53.300
so like my name is Travis, right?

45:53.300 --> 45:55.540
And say I had a son named Robert, right?

45:55.540 --> 45:57.700
Now that person's name is Robert Travis.

45:57.700 --> 45:59.860
And then they have a kid named like Edward,

45:59.860 --> 46:02.020
and that's going to be named Edward Robert Travis.

46:02.020 --> 46:03.620
And then they have a kid named like Michael,

46:03.620 --> 46:06.020
and it's going to be Michael Edward Robert Travis.

46:06.020 --> 46:08.820
And it just keeps getting added on forever.

46:08.820 --> 46:09.540
That's how it works.

46:10.100 --> 46:10.900
That's how it works.

46:10.900 --> 46:12.980
You gotta be careful with making it your profession though,

46:12.980 --> 46:15.860
because if it's something like, you know-

46:15.860 --> 46:16.740
Jeremy Cannibal?

46:17.780 --> 46:18.740
Jeremy Kittenkicker?

46:18.740 --> 46:21.220
If your name is like Jeremy Dudekiller,

46:21.220 --> 46:23.940
then people are gonna, people are, you'll be arrested.

46:23.940 --> 46:24.900
But then you can also be like,

46:24.900 --> 46:26.900
please, Mr. Dudekiller is my father.

46:27.540 --> 46:29.940
Your last name should be the number of followers

46:29.940 --> 46:30.820
you have on Twitter.

46:31.460 --> 46:32.500
That should be the way we do it.

46:32.500 --> 46:33.220
All right.

46:33.220 --> 46:35.140
So I know if I even want to fuck around.

46:35.140 --> 46:38.260
Or your last name could be like a Yelp review.

46:38.260 --> 46:41.460
So it is your profession, but also with a descriptive word.

46:41.460 --> 46:43.460
So it's like Jeremy Bad Doctor.

46:43.460 --> 46:46.260
And you're like, oh no, Stephen Good Sandwich.

46:46.260 --> 46:46.900
And you're like, okay, cool.

46:46.900 --> 46:48.580
And you can kind of get it updated.

46:48.580 --> 46:50.660
People can kind of leave a new last name for you.

46:50.660 --> 46:52.100
That's fun.

46:52.100 --> 46:53.940
And if you're a shock shock radio DJ,

46:53.940 --> 46:57.220
then your name can literally be Dr. Crankenstein.

46:57.220 --> 46:57.860
There you go.

46:58.660 --> 46:59.700
I think your name should be

46:59.700 --> 47:02.020
whatever you announce it is in the moment.

47:02.020 --> 47:03.780
So like, maybe I go to a conference

47:03.780 --> 47:05.460
and I have a very professional name, right?

47:05.460 --> 47:08.260
But then I'm going out to do karaoke later

47:08.260 --> 47:10.900
and I want to be like Jam Jamilton.

47:10.900 --> 47:11.220
Right?

47:11.220 --> 47:12.100
Okay, cool.

47:12.100 --> 47:14.020
My name's Jam Jamilton now.

47:14.020 --> 47:14.660
You know what I mean?

47:15.300 --> 47:19.860
And then I probably am going to need some kind of LED license

47:19.860 --> 47:22.580
that I can change to fit the name.

47:22.580 --> 47:23.700
But that's my idea.

47:23.700 --> 47:25.700
It's just you are whatever you announce.

47:25.700 --> 47:28.180
So maybe like when you go out to karaoke,

47:28.180 --> 47:29.460
you have different friends there

47:29.460 --> 47:31.460
and you want them to call you like Nick.

47:31.460 --> 47:33.380
So that would be sort of like your nickname.

47:33.380 --> 47:36.260
Oh, you have, right?

47:36.260 --> 47:38.180
Like I couldn't tell if that was supposed to be a joke

47:38.180 --> 47:40.420
or just like a good, a good.

47:40.420 --> 47:41.380
No, it wasn't a joke.

47:41.380 --> 47:43.700
I was just pointing out that you just reinvented me.

47:43.700 --> 47:45.700
Yeah, I mean, everybody's name

47:45.700 --> 47:47.220
should be whatever it's going to be.

47:47.220 --> 47:52.100
I'm talking about specifically just the moray of surnames.

47:52.100 --> 47:54.020
Now Johnson's gone.

47:54.020 --> 47:55.060
Johnson's gone.

47:55.060 --> 47:56.020
Miller's gone.

47:56.020 --> 47:59.460
All of these old ass professions and naming conventions.

47:59.460 --> 48:02.020
I really want to dive, dive down deep into

48:02.020 --> 48:04.100
if can they be aspirational?

48:04.100 --> 48:06.340
Can I be called that Griffin Blasthoff astronaut?

48:07.060 --> 48:09.220
Cause I want to be a Blasthoff astronaut.

48:09.220 --> 48:10.500
Yeah, that's a great name.

48:10.500 --> 48:11.300
Yeah.

48:11.300 --> 48:12.340
Is it hyphenated?

48:13.940 --> 48:16.340
Yeah, I mean, so would Griffin basketball superstar

48:16.340 --> 48:18.100
of the 1996 Chicago Bulls.

48:19.460 --> 48:21.380
How about Griffin astronaut superstar?

48:21.380 --> 48:23.300
Astronaut basketball superstar.

48:23.300 --> 48:25.860
Griffin slam dunk space blaster,

48:25.860 --> 48:29.700
Michael Jordan best friend, 96 Bulls game six winner

48:29.700 --> 48:33.700
and high point score MVP and that's the end of the name.

48:34.980 --> 48:36.820
How about Travis just wants to nap?

48:37.860 --> 48:39.060
That's not a job, Travis.

48:39.060 --> 48:39.700
Holy shit.

48:39.700 --> 48:40.660
Get with the program.

48:40.660 --> 48:41.780
No, that's aspirational.

48:41.780 --> 48:46.180
If I can get paid to nap, that's a job and a dream job, Griffin.

48:46.180 --> 48:47.860
I'd be happy with Justin great dad.

48:48.420 --> 48:48.820
Okay.

48:48.820 --> 48:50.900
Well, I mean, we'd all like that, wouldn't we?

48:50.900 --> 48:52.020
If you were a great dad.

48:52.020 --> 48:53.940
Yeah, but I've been, I'm unimpressive.

48:53.940 --> 48:55.380
What about Travis great butt?

48:55.940 --> 48:56.820
Ah, cool.

48:57.380 --> 48:59.620
Yeah, Travis has all been about how good he is.

48:59.620 --> 49:00.420
At his ass.

49:01.140 --> 49:05.060
Maybe yours should be the name of your favorite episode of Friends.

49:06.020 --> 49:06.740
Uh-huh.

49:06.740 --> 49:08.500
Travis, the one with the shirt.

49:10.500 --> 49:12.740
Your first name is your favorite episode of Friends.

49:12.740 --> 49:12.980
Uh-huh.

49:12.980 --> 49:15.700
Your last name is your favorite episode of French.

49:15.700 --> 49:22.260
You just put it together.

49:22.260 --> 49:25.540
The one, I like the one.

49:25.540 --> 49:29.700
Mine is the one with the neighbor that jerks off.

49:29.700 --> 49:30.580
Space monster.

49:33.380 --> 49:37.460
Mine is the one with the tookie head who kills everybody.

49:38.020 --> 49:41.780
Mine is the one where Joey gets his dick stuck in the bathtub drain.

49:42.580 --> 49:44.420
Clone enemy.

49:44.420 --> 49:48.820
My preferred name is the one where Chandler gets caught.

49:48.820 --> 49:54.580
Transilence thought unifier model 11, which is a little bit of a mouthful.

49:54.580 --> 49:56.020
You can just call me Danny.

49:58.420 --> 50:02.420
You can just call me Joey gets his dick stuck in the bathtub drain.

50:03.380 --> 50:04.340
Clone enemy.

50:04.340 --> 50:04.820
I do.

50:04.820 --> 50:06.100
Actually, I want the whole thing.

50:06.100 --> 50:06.500
Don't shorten my fucking name.

50:06.500 --> 50:07.780
Please call me by my full name.

50:09.460 --> 50:13.060
Joey jerked off into the bathtub drain clone enemy was my father.

50:13.060 --> 50:17.060
I'm the one where Joey gets his dick caught in the bathtub drain clone enemy.

50:19.300 --> 50:20.260
Here's another question.

50:21.220 --> 50:22.260
My wife and I are in our 20s.

50:22.260 --> 50:22.820
My wife.

50:22.820 --> 50:24.900
Can I have your fucking relations?

50:25.460 --> 50:28.900
Because she doesn't want to ever physically birth a child.

50:29.460 --> 50:31.860
I got snipped because it was like a hundred bucks.

50:34.100 --> 50:35.300
That's not a kid.

50:36.020 --> 50:37.540
I had a Groupon deal.

50:38.260 --> 50:38.980
Yeah, right?

50:40.020 --> 50:42.100
I was already in the neighborhood.

50:42.100 --> 50:45.060
This guy was just doing them in bulk.

50:45.060 --> 50:46.820
So I got me and 20 of my friends.

50:46.820 --> 50:47.700
He just went down the line.

50:49.140 --> 50:50.500
It was Friday the 13th.

50:50.500 --> 50:53.060
I got that and a cool 13 tattoo.

50:53.060 --> 50:54.340
My dad had to cancel.

50:54.340 --> 50:57.380
So I put on a fake beard like him and said, I'm my dad.

50:57.940 --> 51:00.580
I'll take his vasectomy if he doesn't want it.

51:00.580 --> 51:02.180
You've already cut the knives and everything.

51:02.180 --> 51:04.820
I stood around waiting for a last minute cancellation.

51:05.380 --> 51:08.660
Then it says, the problem is we haven't informed her parents.

51:09.300 --> 51:14.740
Obviously it's our life, but we aren't exactly holding this information secret

51:14.740 --> 51:18.900
and don't want them to find out this information from another source besides us.

51:18.900 --> 51:20.340
How do we tell them this gently?

51:20.340 --> 51:23.700
We might adopt one day, but also that's not a promise.

51:23.700 --> 51:27.460
So we don't want to lead with that to get their hopes up for grandchildren.

51:27.460 --> 51:29.700
That's from Snipped in the South.

51:29.700 --> 51:32.260
I, this is a really delicate and sensitive question.

51:32.260 --> 51:34.500
We should be very mindful of that while we talk about it.

51:35.140 --> 51:38.100
And I think when you are talking,

51:40.100 --> 51:44.900
when you are talking to her parents about this delicate thing,

51:44.900 --> 51:47.780
I think there will be a moment where they are disappointed.

51:47.780 --> 51:52.100
But then when they find out what an amazing deal you got on this vasectomy,

51:52.100 --> 51:55.940
I don't know how they could be upset anymore.

51:56.580 --> 51:59.220
Well, we get it.

51:59.220 --> 52:02.100
Did you say a hundred fucking dollars?

52:04.500 --> 52:06.260
Holy shit.

52:06.260 --> 52:10.660
I might go get a vasectomy again, just because the price is so good.

52:11.220 --> 52:15.380
We're sad that we won't have genetic grandkids,

52:15.380 --> 52:23.220
but we are thrilled that Debra married such a trained bargain hunter as yourself, Skyler.

52:23.220 --> 52:25.620
You know what that was, what, a coupon?

52:25.620 --> 52:26.420
Nice.

52:26.420 --> 52:27.380
Hold on.

52:27.380 --> 52:30.420
I want to call my office and tell them this is amazing.

52:30.420 --> 52:32.340
Is this deal still happening?

52:32.340 --> 52:34.180
Did you get like a card or anything?

52:34.180 --> 52:36.740
Like, do we need to refer somebody or?

52:36.740 --> 52:41.220
Dude, it's just, I mean, here's the thing.

52:41.220 --> 52:46.580
You know, it doesn't rule out them, you know, you've said here it rules them out being grandparents,

52:46.580 --> 52:55.780
but all you've said here in the question is that you're not looking like physically sort of do the whole gestation thing.

52:55.780 --> 52:59.780
So they could pick up some grandchildren, of course, like, obviously.

52:59.780 --> 53:06.260
But you don't want to promise them, and vasectomies, as I understand, are reversible if you do decide to make a choice.

53:06.260 --> 53:07.780
But that's $10,000.

53:07.780 --> 53:09.780
But that's, yeah, that's how they get you, huh?

53:09.780 --> 53:11.780
That's how they get you.

53:11.780 --> 53:13.780
The first taste is free.

53:13.780 --> 53:25.780
The vasectomy is not, okay, we're obviously talking completely out of court, but you've like asked us this question, so we're gonna do our best.

53:25.780 --> 53:29.780
The vasectomy is not the issue at hand.

53:29.780 --> 53:37.780
You don't need to look in your wife's dad's face and say, I got surgery on my wiener.

53:37.780 --> 53:47.780
Your wife needs to tell her parents that she doesn't feel like having kids, she thinks, probably forever, and that's how she feels, and that's fine.

53:47.780 --> 53:53.780
But like, I don't think the inciting event should be the surgery you have on your face.

53:53.780 --> 53:59.780
You don't say like, hey, I fucked up, went to Vegas, got super drunk, accidentally got a vasectomy.

53:59.780 --> 54:01.780
Exactly, right?

54:01.780 --> 54:05.780
It's like the cause, it's a symptom, not the cause.

54:05.780 --> 54:11.780
It's a decision, now tell her parents about the decision you made before they hear about your vasectomy on the nightly news or whatever.

54:11.780 --> 54:21.780
This would be like you going to your parents when you're 15 and being like, so just so you all know, I got the surgery to remove that bone in your arm that makes you go to college.

54:21.780 --> 54:25.780
So that won't be happening.

54:25.780 --> 54:29.780
Yeah, I already had the surgery, I'm sorry.

54:29.780 --> 54:37.780
Yeah, it sounds like a conversation that you all should probably have, but it doesn't have to be a conversation about your extremely personal surgery.

54:37.780 --> 54:43.780
In fact, I would almost kind of file that under like, nobody's business but your own.

54:43.780 --> 54:47.780
Maybe two minutes later.

54:47.780 --> 54:51.780
Like wait until someone else says the word vasectomy in a couple years.

54:51.780 --> 54:59.780
You don't even have to help that much, you can just be the one in the back of the room where they're like, are you sure Vicki? And you're like, I'm pretty sure, I think we're sure on this one.

54:59.780 --> 55:12.780
And then maybe five years later, her dad is like, yeah, so I went down and I found a great, really nice spot in the marina that was open and just got a killer deal on it.

55:12.780 --> 55:15.780
And he'd be like, you think that's a killer deal?

55:15.780 --> 55:25.780
And then you tell you, you're going to tell him about your cheap vasectomy that you got in the basement of a fucking Dick's Sporting Goods, which is funny in a lot of ways.

55:25.780 --> 55:27.780
It's very ironic.

55:27.780 --> 55:29.780
It's very, very good.

55:29.780 --> 55:42.780
I am a little frustrated with you, friend, because you did miss the window where you can tell people these things and they have to be more concerned about the fact that you're having surgery.

55:42.780 --> 55:48.780
You missed the one window where it's like, hey, people need your support.

55:48.780 --> 55:54.780
So it's like, hey, mom, hey, dad, can you bring over a bag of frozen peas for Robert's balls?

55:54.780 --> 55:57.780
I have something to talk to you about.

55:57.780 --> 56:07.780
He needs a bag of frozen peas and a videotape rental with a great film on it.

56:07.780 --> 56:12.780
Oh, best of luck. That is a tender situation.

56:12.780 --> 56:15.780
But all the best to you and yours.

56:15.780 --> 56:17.780
Thank you, folks, so much for listening to our podcast.

56:17.780 --> 56:21.780
I bet it's a tender situation.

56:21.780 --> 56:24.780
Trust me, it is a tender situation.

56:24.780 --> 56:26.780
Yeah, no, it wasn't a joke observation.

56:26.780 --> 56:30.780
No, it is. I mean, it is. I'm coming from a real place here.

56:30.780 --> 56:35.780
A lot of inflamed tissue, I bet, that hurts quite a bit.

56:35.780 --> 56:37.780
Yeah, in the genital area.

56:37.780 --> 56:39.780
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

56:39.780 --> 56:42.780
Yowza. I hate to see that, folks.

56:42.780 --> 56:46.780
So here's the thing, fucking nobody's coming to our Cleveland show.

56:46.780 --> 56:49.780
We really need you to come buy tickets, okay?

56:49.780 --> 56:52.780
And try to get friends to buy tickets and trick them.

56:52.780 --> 56:55.780
We've heard good things about the Cleve. We're excited to be there.

56:55.780 --> 57:00.780
All the other places are doing like really good to pretty good.

57:00.780 --> 57:03.780
So many, half of their shows are sold out.

57:03.780 --> 57:05.780
Only it's the half that we're not doing for a while,

57:05.780 --> 57:06.780
and we're doing this one in a week.

57:06.780 --> 57:08.780
We're starting to freak out a little bit, please.

57:08.780 --> 57:10.780
We've been hitting up Dietrich Bader.

57:10.780 --> 57:13.780
We've been hitting up fucking Ryan Stiles.

57:13.780 --> 57:16.780
We've been hitting up Christa Miller, like get out to this show.

57:16.780 --> 57:18.780
And then I find out they don't actually live there,

57:18.780 --> 57:21.780
and I've been lied to my whole fucking life by the Drew Carey Show?

57:21.780 --> 57:23.780
Sucks.

57:23.780 --> 57:27.780
And listen, hey, if you need added reason,

57:27.780 --> 57:29.780
Paul and Storm are going to be there playing.

57:29.780 --> 57:31.780
It's going to be incredibly fun.

57:31.780 --> 57:35.780
We've never had them open a show for us, and we're super excited about it.

57:35.780 --> 57:38.780
And they're going to do really good music that you're going to like,

57:38.780 --> 57:40.780
and all your friends are going to like,

57:40.780 --> 57:42.780
so you should bring them with you to the show.

57:42.780 --> 57:44.780
Travis, stop fucking selling.

57:44.780 --> 57:46.780
They can smell this bullshit a mile away.

57:46.780 --> 57:50.780
Guys, all that stuff Travis said was true, but mainly like,

57:50.780 --> 57:53.780
please, we can't all be ruined.

57:53.780 --> 57:55.780
Please just buy tickets.

57:55.780 --> 57:57.780
Between this and bean juice, we've got a lot of them lined up.

57:57.780 --> 57:59.780
It's in a row.

57:59.780 --> 58:01.780
The mugs are fucking good, and they make the coffee taste better.

58:01.780 --> 58:03.780
In completely unrelated news,

58:03.780 --> 58:06.780
if you head over to mcrorymerch.com right now,

58:06.780 --> 58:08.780
and just suck up on bean juice mugs,

58:08.780 --> 58:10.780
you'd love to sell a few of those.

58:10.780 --> 58:14.780
Yeah, these things are worth their weight in ceramic.

58:14.780 --> 58:18.780
Which you'll need to craft new stuff in your city.

58:18.780 --> 58:20.780
Sure, bone spears and stuff.

58:20.780 --> 58:22.780
They make a great bone spear.

58:22.780 --> 58:26.780
We also have a new I Hate You Ron pin of the month

58:26.780 --> 58:28.780
that's only going to be available in May.

58:28.780 --> 58:32.780
There's a new Sawbones shirt about vaccines.

58:32.780 --> 58:35.780
There's some Schmaner's thank you notes over there,

58:35.780 --> 58:37.780
and a Schmaner's tote bag.

58:37.780 --> 58:38.780
Some really cool stuff.

58:38.780 --> 58:40.780
There's Rachel's poetry corner from Wonderful

58:40.780 --> 58:42.780
that I am just a big fan of.

58:42.780 --> 58:43.780
The pin.

58:43.780 --> 58:44.780
Yes, the pin.

58:44.780 --> 58:45.780
Thank you.

58:45.780 --> 58:46.780
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

58:46.780 --> 58:47.780
for these for a theme song.

58:47.780 --> 58:50.780
It's a departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

58:50.780 --> 58:55.780
Just a really swanky, snazzy album

58:55.780 --> 58:57.780
with a lot of fresh tracks on it, kid.

58:57.780 --> 58:58.780
You're going to love them.

58:58.780 --> 59:00.780
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network

59:00.780 --> 59:01.780
at MaximumFun.org.

59:01.780 --> 59:04.780
You can find all of your earthly pleasures and delights.

59:04.780 --> 59:07.780
It would probably help if we said that you can get those tickets

59:07.780 --> 59:09.780
at McElroy.family and click on tours.

59:09.780 --> 59:10.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:10.780 --> 59:13.780
Or bit.ly forward slash Become the Monster.

59:13.780 --> 59:14.780
Yeah.

59:14.780 --> 59:17.780
It's the first show of this Become the Monster tour.

59:17.780 --> 59:18.780
It's the first one.

59:18.780 --> 59:20.780
Please, that'd be so demoralizing.

59:20.780 --> 59:23.780
I was trying to come up with good ideas.

59:23.780 --> 59:25.780
Wolfman will buy tickets.

59:25.780 --> 59:28.780
We'll do some tricks.

59:28.780 --> 59:30.780
Justin will juggle.

59:30.780 --> 59:31.780
I don't know, whatever you want.

59:31.780 --> 59:33.780
I was thinking maybe we talk about Star Wars

59:33.780 --> 59:34.780
for an hour and a half.

59:34.780 --> 59:35.780
Oh, no.

59:35.780 --> 59:36.780
Yeah.

59:36.780 --> 59:37.780
Yeah, that's a good idea.

59:37.780 --> 59:39.780
So here's the final Yahoo.

59:39.780 --> 59:42.780
It's from another anonymous Yahoo answer user.

59:42.780 --> 59:44.780
I'm going to call Diedrick Bader, who asks,

59:44.780 --> 59:47.780
do you eat celery in the military?

59:50.780 --> 59:51.780
My name is Justin McElroy.

59:51.780 --> 59:52.780
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:52.780 --> 59:53.780
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:53.780 --> 59:55.780
This has been my brother, my brother.

59:55.780 --> 59:57.780
May it kiss your dad square on the lips.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.780
Maximumfun.org.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:17.780
Comedy and culture.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.780
Artist-owned.

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.780
Listener-supported.

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:22.780
What are you laughing at, James?

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:23.780
I'm not kidding.

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.780
I'm laughing at you.

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:26.780
What?

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:27.780
And me, too.

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:28.780
Huh?

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:31.780
Our podcast, Minority Corner Silly.

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.780
Oh, the one where we talk about topics that cover

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.780
the queer community, race, feminism,

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:38.780
and good old pop culture?

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:39.780
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:40.780
Yeah, that's it.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.780
Girl, we are so funny.

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.780
I was just thinking about something we did.

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:46.780
Wait, wait, wait.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:51.780
Are you listening to me or me?

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:54.780
Both.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:55.780
Minority Corner.

01:00:55.780 --> 01:01:22.780
Every Friday.
