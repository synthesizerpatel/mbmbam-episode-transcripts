00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:54.800
Hey everybody, it's E3 time again. Heading out to sunny LA to see the latest and greatest in

00:54.800 --> 00:59.120
video games. This is my brother, my brother, and me, the Vice Chef of the Modern Era. I'm Justin,

00:59.120 --> 01:07.840
and the middle one's Travis and Griffin, but I want to talk to our leading video game expert to

01:07.840 --> 01:14.160
get his predictions about what we're going to see as a big show. Travis McElroy, video games have

01:14.160 --> 01:21.520
come a long way since Pac-Man, as I remember it. Maybe you could let us in on what we can expect

01:21.520 --> 01:27.840
from interactive entertainment in 2014 at E3. Well, the buzz is that they're going to make

01:27.840 --> 01:35.120
Pac-Man, but for girls. And what will the difference be? Just an ass with some

01:35.680 --> 01:40.400
fair amount of trepidation? The Pac-Man will have female genitalia,

01:42.160 --> 01:47.520
and it will be visible. I always assumed Pac-Man's mouth was a vagina this whole time.

01:47.520 --> 01:53.440
Is that incorrect? No, it is correct. It'll just be more blatant. Our fastest,

01:53.440 --> 01:59.520
most problematic episode to date. So what else can we expect from video games?

02:00.560 --> 02:06.320
Well, do you remember the Sonic game for Dreamcast in which you could collect little animals,

02:06.320 --> 02:08.160
and they were in your memory card? Chows.

02:09.280 --> 02:13.040
They're going to take that, but turn it into a little standalone game.

02:14.400 --> 02:18.560
You can feed the animals and clean up their poop and exercise them.

02:18.560 --> 02:24.240
So like a Tamagotchi is what? Like a what? Except they will die within seconds.

02:24.240 --> 02:29.920
They're telling us we need to wrap up our segment. Any other quick rapid fire predictions

02:29.920 --> 02:33.440
about the big show? I think they're going to make a new Mario game.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.600
That's probably- Now when you say they.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.440
Uh-huh. Video game people. The video game people are-

02:39.440 --> 02:41.680
The video gamesters. Jim Tendo.

02:41.680 --> 02:51.840
Hi, my name is Jim Tendo. I've been making Mario games from my garage for the past 30 years,

02:51.840 --> 02:55.280
and I'm not going to do a goddamn thing different. It's all I know.

02:55.280 --> 03:00.880
His original name wasn't Mario. It was Mark. My brother Mark, who is a plumber, yes.

03:00.880 --> 03:08.320
I have a calendar. Each page is one year. On alternating pages, there are pictures of Mario

03:08.320 --> 03:14.240
and Link. It helps me remember what game I'm making. Guess which year this is?

03:14.800 --> 03:17.920
Santa Star. We don't even do Santa Star, I don't think.

03:18.880 --> 03:23.840
And when I say they, I just mean me, Jim Tendo. Jim Tendo, I make all of the video games you play.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.920
I want to help people. I don't like video games anymore.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.800
Me neither. I just think they peaked.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.800
When? Prince of Persia, the original one? Battle Toads.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.000
Battle Toads. Quest for Glory.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.840
I haven't played a game that has been as good as Quest for Glory since Quest for Glory.

03:44.640 --> 03:45.760
That's goddamn true.

03:46.320 --> 03:51.200
Yeah, that's accurate. Let's not talk about this anymore. I feel like this is excluding,

03:52.880 --> 03:56.640
well, if not a majority of our audience, at least all the cool ones.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.480
Yeah, video games are a huge bummer.

03:58.480 --> 04:03.120
So let's move on to some helping. I work on a history ship. No ghosts, sorry.

04:03.120 --> 04:08.080
Now, to be fair, Jocelyn, it does say historic ship, not a history ship.

04:08.080 --> 04:13.120
Hup along on my history ship. We're going back to 1512.

04:14.160 --> 04:17.040
What's up in 1512? Nothing, it sucks. Hop on the boat.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.840
Here comes the time dock.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.320
Oh shit, we missed the time dock.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.880
Time to pay your fees to disembark.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.320
We missed the time dock.

04:26.320 --> 04:29.520
Now it's 1314. It gets worse as you go back.

04:31.040 --> 04:35.520
Now we're going to charge you all a premium for the smallpox vaccine.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.320
That's how they get you on history time ship.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.720
That's how they extort you on the history ship.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.160
I work on a historic ship. No ghosts, sorry.

04:44.160 --> 04:44.720
Prove that.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.320
And also that you can see and that have made their presence known.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.560
I mean, let's qualify a little bit.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.520
They're all around us.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.640
I also live in one of the staterooms that you see on the ship.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.840
I also live in one of the staterooms that used to be officer's quarters.

04:57.840 --> 05:03.520
The deal is that I live here for free as long as I agree to be the after hours security guard.

05:03.520 --> 05:08.480
The problem is I have a hard time kicking people off who snuck on late at night.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.560
I'm not a naturally intimidating person.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.960
I'm a young early twenties woman, usually very cheerful, sort of plump,

05:14.960 --> 05:17.360
and I like nearly everyone I meet.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.720
What are some things I can do to scare trespassers

05:20.720 --> 05:22.560
so they'll get lost without putting up a fight?

05:22.560 --> 05:25.200
And that's from Scarcely Scary Sailor.

05:25.200 --> 05:30.080
Your last sentence, your last sentence is answered by your first one.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.800
Yes. A thousand times yes.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.640
You have to pretend a ghost.

05:34.640 --> 05:35.760
You gotta ghost them.

05:36.560 --> 05:37.680
You have to ghost them.

05:38.800 --> 05:43.120
All you have to do, walk up in like an old timey dress and say like,

05:43.120 --> 05:45.200
have you seen my child?

05:45.200 --> 05:47.520
And they will fucking run away.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.840
Oh, God, Travis, you just put a chill up my spine.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.600
A ghostly chill.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.560
DMVM chillers.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.960
Have you seen my husband?

05:54.960 --> 05:57.920
Oh, yeah, he'd be in the lifeboats.

05:59.920 --> 06:00.880
Tropic chillers.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.200
I'm cold.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.560
I ate some bad shrimp at the buffet.

06:06.560 --> 06:10.480
Oh no, I've had the norovirus for three days.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.720
I don't have any fluid in my body or my bowels.

06:14.720 --> 06:15.220
Boop.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.240
I booped everywhere.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.840
The border lost my trunk.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.360
That's not ectoplasm.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.560
It's my crushing diarrhea again.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.840
Oh no, I've gotta go bye.

06:30.320 --> 06:35.440
I, what if you, what if you are too good?

06:36.080 --> 06:36.960
Is my worry.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.360
And they stab you because they don't know how ghosts work.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.560
And they bust you.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.960
No, and they, no, they call the ghostbusters.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.560
Here's my question, okay?

06:44.560 --> 06:46.480
You're a very convincing ghost.

06:46.480 --> 06:46.800
Yeah.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.600
All right.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.320
The ghostbusters show up to bust you.

06:51.440 --> 06:55.120
You tell them, oh, sorry, I understand the confusion.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.240
I'm a human pretending to be a ghost.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.680
I'm ghost catfishing.

06:59.680 --> 07:00.640
I'm ghost fishing.

07:01.520 --> 07:05.440
They say, ha ha ghost, oldest trick in the book.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.200
You don't think slime are trying that shit.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.400
We've tried this one.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.040
We've seen this one many, many times before.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.400
You are a ghost.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.760
Busting makes me feel good.

07:14.400 --> 07:14.880
Add it up.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.600
And those proton beams.

07:18.320 --> 07:22.160
Those, those don't just like make you twirl around.

07:22.160 --> 07:26.560
And when, and sparks shoot off of you, those will lathe you in half.

07:26.560 --> 07:26.880
Okay.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.280
So we can all agree that there is a circumstance in which the

07:29.280 --> 07:31.840
ghostbusters have accidentally murdered people.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.600
Almost certainly.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.680
Almost break into the bus, busting HQ late at night.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.640
And, and Winston's jumpy.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.400
He's like, whoa, who's that?

07:42.400 --> 07:44.880
And then he opens his bedroom door blast.

07:44.880 --> 07:45.520
Oops.

07:45.520 --> 07:45.920
Oops.

07:45.920 --> 07:46.240
Sorry.

07:46.240 --> 07:46.720
I know.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.560
Why would you jump on Winston?

07:48.560 --> 07:49.920
Who is my favorite ghost buster.

07:49.920 --> 07:50.400
Yeah.

07:50.400 --> 07:50.640
Yeah.

07:50.640 --> 07:51.600
Justin, you want to explain that?

07:52.400 --> 07:52.720
Why?

07:52.720 --> 07:55.440
I just, I thought he might be near the front door.

07:56.160 --> 07:56.480
Makes sense.

07:56.480 --> 07:56.880
I don't know.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.320
Cause he was the last ghost buster.

07:58.320 --> 07:58.720
So he was the last ghost buster.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.160
Oh, so he got the shittiest bed.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.600
Everybody else wants to be on the second floor above them

08:03.600 --> 08:06.720
so they can use the pole, you know, and they know immediately

08:06.720 --> 08:08.000
when they fucked up too, right?

08:08.560 --> 08:10.240
Cause you kill, you kill the woman.

08:10.240 --> 08:14.640
And then she's just there again, but in a different form.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.840
Now you do need to bust that because she,

08:17.840 --> 08:20.240
she has been murdered in a horrible manner.

08:20.240 --> 08:23.680
And then it just goes down in the books as a preemptive busting.

08:23.680 --> 08:23.920
Yeah.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.160
That's a good point, Travis.

08:26.160 --> 08:30.080
It's a causal busting, not premeditated,

08:30.080 --> 08:33.040
not premeditated accidental causal busting.

08:34.560 --> 08:36.240
So we hope you, you know what?

08:36.800 --> 08:38.400
You don't need to scare people off.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.440
Just be cool.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.800
Listen, honest to God, I've never snuck into anything ever,

08:42.800 --> 08:45.120
but I can imagine that if I snuck onto something

08:45.120 --> 08:49.040
and somebody with a flashlight period were to say,

08:49.040 --> 08:50.160
Hey, get off.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.200
I'd be like, Oh, yep.

08:51.200 --> 08:51.440
Yep.

08:51.440 --> 08:51.840
Yep.

08:51.840 --> 08:52.080
Yep.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.400
You got cursing a lot is good too.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.280
That one's on me.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.400
I'm not supposed to be here.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.600
And I recognize that I am a dork.

08:59.600 --> 08:59.840
Yeah.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.880
It seems weird that people wouldn't just like leave.

09:02.880 --> 09:03.360
I don't know.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.640
I would be so frightened.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.960
I hear anyone who tries to argue like, no, I'm,

09:06.960 --> 09:08.320
I'm supposed to be here.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.160
I'm on the list.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.680
I'm on the historic boat list.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.040
If you could take a look.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.360
I just think you throw a good throaty curse at them

09:16.240 --> 09:16.800
and they're gone.

09:16.800 --> 09:17.840
So what's more scary?

09:17.840 --> 09:19.360
If somebody shines a flashlight on you in a place,

09:19.360 --> 09:21.120
you're not supposed to be, he's like, Hey, get out of here.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.120
Or like, Hey, get the fuck out of here.

09:23.120 --> 09:23.840
You're gone.

09:23.840 --> 09:24.400
You've vanished.

09:24.400 --> 09:24.880
You're out.

09:24.880 --> 09:25.440
You're done.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.360
I'll eat your fucking eyeballs.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.120
I assume they hired a Frankenstein.

09:29.120 --> 09:29.360
Yeah.

09:30.320 --> 09:30.560
Yeah.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.000
No noise that scary could come from you.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.280
They captured, they took the history shit back in time

09:35.280 --> 09:36.800
to when Frankenstein was.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.080
And they captured him.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.600
1991.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.200
You all remember that, right?

09:45.200 --> 09:47.440
You guys don't remember that.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.600
You remember when Frankenstein had that hit song,

09:49.600 --> 09:51.680
I'm too sexy for my shirt, right?

09:51.680 --> 09:52.480
That's how you know.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.400
That's how you know you're a child in the nineties.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.320
You remember when Frankenstein was alive.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.280
It's one reason to know if you were a child in the nineties,

09:59.280 --> 10:00.960
Frankenstein killed your sister.

10:03.120 --> 10:03.840
You want to Yahoo?

10:04.480 --> 10:04.960
Sure.

10:04.960 --> 10:08.640
So Yahoo was sent in by fucking who do you think drew Davenport

10:09.360 --> 10:09.680
guys.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.600
I can show you just have a direct pipeline.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.000
I think we need to get drew on the show to explain like how

10:14.000 --> 10:15.600
he finds these goddamn gyms.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.560
Cause they're all gyms.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.000
And like, I'm not saying that everybody else is bad,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.080
but I mean, he's clearly running the game right now.

10:22.080 --> 10:22.720
Spoiler alert.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.120
He has three questions on the show.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.080
I don't even need to say who sent him in anymore.

10:28.080 --> 10:28.400
Anyway.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.360
And remember level now you just have to say when they weren't

10:31.360 --> 10:33.920
sent in by driven level 61.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.600
One Yahoo shaman.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.040
He bought the expansion.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.800
He broke past the level cap.

10:38.800 --> 10:39.120
Thank you.

10:39.120 --> 10:40.640
It's a hundred to get them out.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.280
Thank you, Drew.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.440
It's asked by Yahoo answers user KTI who asks.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.480
Does jail make you a man?

10:50.800 --> 10:52.960
If it does, I'm thinking of stealing something or hurting

10:52.960 --> 10:54.800
someone so that I can go there.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.760
I want to get bulked up and have a strong personality.

10:57.760 --> 10:58.320
So does it?

10:58.960 --> 11:00.000
So does it or not?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.680
I think we should strip that.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.600
I think we should strip the gender from this.

11:04.320 --> 11:04.400
Yeah.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.080
Does it make you tough?

11:06.080 --> 11:08.000
Doesn't make you a grownup, right?

11:08.000 --> 11:08.960
I mean, that's the question.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.680
I guess if we're being very literal about it, does it make

11:11.680 --> 11:12.960
you older than 18?

11:12.960 --> 11:17.120
I think I, of course, these are not the same class of people,

11:17.120 --> 11:20.880
but there is something to me about people who've been in a

11:20.880 --> 11:23.520
prison or served in the military and that they've been in

11:23.520 --> 11:25.280
something that is unknowable to me.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.720
These are not an experience.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.360
You hope.

11:27.360 --> 11:32.640
I hope, right, that I have ever had, will ever have, I hope.

11:32.640 --> 11:37.600
So that does make me see them differently.

11:37.600 --> 11:42.560
I don't know if like grown up is the word.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.680
But here's my thing, because I've been trying to think like

11:45.680 --> 11:49.760
where that perception comes from.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.160
And it's got to be just like movies and TV, because every

11:52.160 --> 11:55.120
time I've watched like an actual documentary or a movie

11:55.120 --> 11:57.760
every time I've watched like an actual documentary or anything

11:57.760 --> 12:00.400
that actually like shows real prisons and real people in the

12:00.400 --> 12:03.840
prisons, it just seems like it makes you sad.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.720
Yeah, you know, but like in movies, it's always like, oh,

12:06.720 --> 12:10.320
it made them toughened them up, made their souls all leathery

12:10.320 --> 12:13.120
and you couldn't mess with them after that because they'd been

12:13.120 --> 12:13.840
in prison.

12:13.840 --> 12:16.000
But really, then you watch things and it's just like, I

12:16.000 --> 12:17.440
miss my family.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.080
I don't know about that.

12:18.080 --> 12:21.600
Like Shawshank had like maybe a few rough members in there.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.840
But most of the dudes in Shawshank, I would say, are

12:25.840 --> 12:26.560
pretty pillowy.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.720
I mean, I guess that's true.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.440
Shawshank's more about like breaking people.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.120
It's more about, you know, like fucking Brooks and shit.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.160
And okay, Brooks didn't come out tough.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.800
No one at the supermarket that Brooks will work that was

12:40.800 --> 12:41.680
like, do not do not.

12:41.680 --> 12:44.320
Damn, don't fuck with Brooks.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.640
He will sharpen a carrot and stab you in the eyeball.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.920
Brooks was here, bitch.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.120
Stab, stab, stab.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.600
Yeah, that would be a way better movie.

12:56.560 --> 12:57.520
Man, that movie sucks.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.720
Shawshank Redemption 2.

12:59.680 --> 13:00.720
Brooks was here.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.720
That movie could have used way more produced violence in it.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.360
I mainly just included this question to ask if you guys

13:11.360 --> 13:13.040
think you would do good in jail.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.280
Because like I sometimes think about it and I think about

13:15.280 --> 13:16.960
putting myself in that situation.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.520
And I think about how I would thrive on like a strategic

13:19.520 --> 13:22.240
level and I would like make the right partnerships and

13:22.240 --> 13:24.480
alliances with the people that I needed to to help really

13:24.480 --> 13:25.200
help myself rain.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.760
But then I think, oh, I'm thinking of Survivor.

13:27.760 --> 13:31.360
Well, we just I think we have the closest thing we have to

13:31.360 --> 13:33.920
this is middle school.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.680
I was just about to say that.

13:35.680 --> 13:38.320
I was just going to say, I know we talked about this last week,

13:38.320 --> 13:39.760
but middle school is prison.

13:39.760 --> 13:43.040
I certainly adapted to that socioeconomic structure by

13:43.040 --> 13:45.040
graduating after three years.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.880
Yeah, that was the way I dealt with that.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.160
You don't upset the guards.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.240
I went to your three years.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.120
You get out.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.680
I went to come back middle clink and it was not.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.880
I look back at my time at come back and think about how much

13:58.880 --> 14:01.680
I spent like, OK, you're like the football team.

14:01.680 --> 14:02.880
Popular cool kids.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.280
I want to make you laugh and make you guys not want to beat

14:05.280 --> 14:06.160
me up.

14:06.160 --> 14:10.240
I don't remember ever getting beat up or it wasn't just that.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.520
It wasn't just that, was it?

14:11.520 --> 14:15.520
It was OK, so it seems like I have to sort of fit into a group

14:15.520 --> 14:16.080
and find a group.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.400
Well, I'm going to take a day and think about it.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.280
Oh, fuck it.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.880
All the groups are closed now.

14:20.880 --> 14:21.920
Well, I guess I'm just.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.520
Oh, you're all calling me Pig Boy.

14:23.520 --> 14:25.200
My new name is Pig Boy.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.800
My new name is Pig Boy.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.760
And this gentleman stole my super donut.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.040
Oh, how fun.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.640
No, that is that is fine.

14:32.640 --> 14:36.960
It's my fault for taking a day to think about what the role

14:36.960 --> 14:39.520
that I'm going to fill for the rest of my come back middle

14:39.520 --> 14:41.760
clink career is going to be.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.560
No, that's fine.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.240
No, that's my fault for taking a day.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.800
Yeah, that is that is really true.

14:46.800 --> 14:51.600
I would constantly see people in groups or teams and think,

14:51.600 --> 14:54.160
how did you get into that?

14:54.800 --> 14:56.000
How did you do this?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.600
Did you sign up for it?

14:57.600 --> 15:00.240
Was it a thing like you pay ten dollars?

15:00.240 --> 15:02.480
Did you all get pants at the same time?

15:02.480 --> 15:05.040
And you all looked at each other's wieners and you were

15:05.040 --> 15:06.480
like, well, this sucks.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.280
Should we hang out?

15:07.280 --> 15:09.360
We're going to do our own thing here, right?

15:09.360 --> 15:11.920
So we can watch each other's backs and not get pants.

15:11.920 --> 15:15.280
Did one football man do like a running tackle and managed to

15:15.280 --> 15:18.560
get all six of you in his wingspan and pinned you to the

15:18.560 --> 15:21.360
ground and peed in your hair at the same time?

15:21.360 --> 15:22.960
And you're just like, well, I guess we're friends now.

15:23.840 --> 15:27.920
The only group I ever heard about and oh, my God, I'm just

15:27.920 --> 15:29.280
remembering this story.

15:29.280 --> 15:33.520
And in the context of the present day, it is very strange

15:34.080 --> 15:37.760
that at one point in middle school, I had one chance to get

15:37.760 --> 15:40.000
into a click or a group of some sort.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.280
There was a young lady who told me about an organization that

15:45.280 --> 15:50.400
she was involved in where they it was sort of like a youth

15:50.400 --> 15:54.320
group, except the main activity was that they would take the

15:54.320 --> 15:59.840
youth around to try to buy cigarettes to see if they could.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.600
And that was going to be your click?

16:01.600 --> 16:04.400
You were going to be part of fucking Narc Club?

16:04.400 --> 16:08.960
No, like Narc Club apparently did like a ton of other cool

16:08.960 --> 16:11.600
shit as I remember, like go to movies and have pizza parties.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.160
They tried to buy cigarettes and also drank a lot of beer.

16:15.520 --> 16:19.920
Now that I'm like thinking about it in like in retrospect,

16:19.920 --> 16:23.280
maybe my like non-involvement with this particular club-

16:23.280 --> 16:25.280
With the fucking honey pot society?

16:27.440 --> 16:28.320
We're bait kids.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.720
Come hang out with us, Justin.

16:31.280 --> 16:32.720
Hi, I'm the leader of this group.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.040
I'm John Quinones and these are my bait kids.

16:35.040 --> 16:39.200
Come on, bait kids.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.160
To be fair, that does seem like the like first you go in and

16:42.160 --> 16:45.440
try to buy cigarettes and then like next step you go to a

16:45.440 --> 16:48.320
restaurant and see if you get carded and then third step

16:48.320 --> 16:49.680
you're catching predators.

16:50.720 --> 16:51.680
We're going to knock up.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.680
Listen, we got a busy day of filming.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.840
We need to get you kids all around town.

16:55.840 --> 16:59.760
By the third show, though, like the criminal element in that

16:59.760 --> 17:01.200
town is calling each other like, hey, watch out.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.000
Bait kids are out.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
Don't pick up one of those bait kids.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.200
Bait kids are on the prowl.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.080
I would like a glass of wine, please.

17:10.080 --> 17:11.200
Yeah, right, bait kid.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.240
Let me see your ID.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.000
I already got the call from Hector.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.040
You got it.

17:17.040 --> 17:17.680
Oh, you're right.

17:18.960 --> 17:19.520
You're right.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.360
This is convincing makeup.

17:21.360 --> 17:24.960
Quinones will go to any length to fuck you over.

17:24.960 --> 17:29.360
I bet you actually are 16 and you got Jack disease and you're

17:29.360 --> 17:31.200
legally a 16 year old.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.800
That's the only community I still go to.

17:32.800 --> 17:33.760
Get out of here.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.880
Get out of here, bait kid.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.400
You wrinkly ass kid.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.200
Wrinkly ass bait kid with your old liver spots and you're

17:39.200 --> 17:39.600
dying.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.240
You're dying.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.040
And you're dying, miss.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.480
Oh, God, you're dying now.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.760
You're way, way before me.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.680
Like the dude in Holy Grail.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.200
You're really selling this bait kid.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.160
You're turning to dust.

17:50.720 --> 17:51.200
You're turning to dust.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.560
You have chosen poorly.

17:56.480 --> 17:56.960
You never know.

17:56.960 --> 17:57.840
I'm so sorry, bait kid.

17:57.840 --> 18:00.400
I miss you, bait kid.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.920
I wish you were still here, bait kid.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.760
Quinones rolls up like 15 minutes later.

18:05.760 --> 18:06.800
Time to move to the next set.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.400
What did you do to my bait kid?

18:10.080 --> 18:10.880
He's ash.

18:14.320 --> 18:17.600
He was my nephew and he had Jack disease and I loved him.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.160
This is the fourth old ass bait kid this week.

18:21.120 --> 18:24.320
That bait kid nephew is going to make me richer than I am.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.600
I'm already very rich.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.200
John Quinones.

18:29.200 --> 18:34.320
I'm 26 and I've recently started going to college again after a dismal attempt at online

18:34.320 --> 18:34.800
education.

18:34.800 --> 18:40.160
I met this lovely young lady in my public speaking course that I really dug and we have

18:40.160 --> 18:42.000
some great common footing.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.400
We're about the same age with similar interests.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.120
We both work full time and we go to school full time.

18:47.120 --> 18:51.200
We started getting a little flirtatious during class, but then I found out her last name.

18:51.200 --> 18:56.800
It turns out she is the niece of my stepfather's stepfather.

18:57.520 --> 19:08.000
Now, I'm no genealogist, but I think by marriage that makes us double step cousins once removed.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.240
Hachi-machi, now I know it.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.160
She knows it and the American people know it.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.600
Pump them brakes or keep on trucking.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.960
That's for maybe a mishap in Grand Rapids.

19:18.960 --> 19:26.000
I can't, I can't like, is there, there's, is there any blood there?

19:26.640 --> 19:30.080
The point, the point is not whether or not there's blood.

19:30.080 --> 19:32.000
It, I mean, it doesn't matter, right?

19:32.000 --> 19:32.480
Is that-

19:32.480 --> 19:33.680
That sounds so cra-

19:33.680 --> 19:34.080
Like I-

19:35.040 --> 19:37.920
Justin Tyler McElroy, let me pitch this.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.960
Is the point, here's what I'm, here's what I'm trying to get to here, guys.

19:41.760 --> 19:45.840
You are, you are wanting to move on because you don't know if there's blood or not.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.360
I'm saying, is that the issue?

19:47.360 --> 19:49.760
This is the fucking Kobayashi Maru though.

19:49.760 --> 19:55.120
Because what I'm saying is it's not the issue because the issue is you know and your family

19:55.120 --> 20:00.160
knows and that's the thing is like, okay, let's, let's draw a line down two, three years.

20:00.160 --> 20:01.280
You guys really hit it off.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.280
You get engaged, day of the wedding.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.840
Are you on the groom's side or the bride's side?

20:05.840 --> 20:06.240
Both.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.720
But that's so far off.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.880
What if it's love?

20:10.880 --> 20:12.080
I did, this is what I'm saying.

20:12.080 --> 20:15.280
I don't want to fall into this trap, but that's so crazy far apart.

20:15.280 --> 20:19.520
Like, you never would have met her, you know?

20:19.520 --> 20:20.320
Except you did.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.680
You did though.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.760
You did meet her though.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.640
It wasn't even at a, it wasn't at a family gathering.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.240
That's fair.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.840
I guess you got points in that column.

20:29.840 --> 20:37.120
You didn't meet her by just like nature or God or what have you brought you two together,

20:37.120 --> 20:37.600
right?

20:37.600 --> 20:38.880
Probably nature and God.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.240
God wants this to happen.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.400
God wants this to happen if that's true.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.440
Nature wants it to happen.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.280
Mother Gaia.

20:45.280 --> 20:48.880
Are you, do you like each other because you are related?

20:48.880 --> 20:55.200
Do you have a weird uncle that you both shared tender memories of before realizing that it

20:55.200 --> 20:56.320
was the same guy?

20:56.320 --> 21:02.880
Well, it would be your weird uncle, her like step brother, uncle, step, it'd be your step

21:02.880 --> 21:04.400
bruncle at that point.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.640
It would be your funky.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.760
It would be your funky, funky, dunkey, unkey.

21:09.760 --> 21:12.080
My boy just got married last weekend.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.760
Mad props to Jacob Dunkel.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.440
I'm so, so proud of you.

21:16.000 --> 21:16.480
What's up?

21:16.480 --> 21:17.040
Funky uncle.

21:17.040 --> 21:17.520
What up?

21:17.520 --> 21:18.240
Funky uncle.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.760
Thanks for the bachelor party invite.

21:21.760 --> 21:22.960
You piece of trash.

21:24.240 --> 21:24.880
Just kidding.

21:25.440 --> 21:26.240
Human garbage.

21:26.240 --> 21:27.760
I hope you had a good time.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.400
All right.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.440
Here comes another question coming right to your dome.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.680
My girlfriend and I just moved in together.

21:33.680 --> 21:39.840
Neither of us have lived with a significant other for a long-term period and we need advice

21:39.840 --> 21:40.880
about finances.

21:40.880 --> 21:45.280
What's the best way to keep track of how much we're both spending and divide it up evenly?

21:45.280 --> 21:46.320
Some other details.

21:47.280 --> 21:51.680
I work full-time and make a reasonable but not excessive amount of money.

21:51.680 --> 21:55.520
And my girlfriend is preparing to go to med school next year.

21:56.480 --> 22:02.400
So there's an income difference between us and that's from long-term in Louisville.

22:02.400 --> 22:07.680
This is a great question because we have the opportunity to between the three of us

22:07.680 --> 22:11.280
determine, like, this is like we're talking about sitting on the same side of the table,

22:11.280 --> 22:13.120
other side of the table, that kind of thing.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.640
How do you guys do it?

22:15.200 --> 22:16.480
I had to, by the way, do that.

22:16.480 --> 22:20.880
We went to an Italian restaurant yesterday, regional I did, and we sat at like a semicircle

22:20.880 --> 22:26.240
table and they put like all of our plates and shit together at the end of the semicircle.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.600
It was a waking nightmare.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.800
We were both just shuddering the entire time.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.520
We couldn't even-

22:33.520 --> 22:34.240
Don't touch me.

22:34.240 --> 22:34.800
We couldn't eat.

22:34.800 --> 22:38.160
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.280
What do we do?

22:39.280 --> 22:40.320
Like, I don't-

22:40.320 --> 22:43.920
Doesn't everybody reach a point where they just don't give a fuck about how the money's

22:43.920 --> 22:45.280
distributed anymore?

22:45.280 --> 22:46.240
Is that marriage?

22:46.240 --> 22:46.720
Because I think I-

22:46.720 --> 22:48.080
That's absolutely right.

22:48.080 --> 22:53.280
I think I hit that point like way before marriage where like we-

22:54.080 --> 22:57.920
It was even before we got like a joint checking account or anything like that.

22:58.480 --> 22:58.800
It was just like-

22:58.800 --> 22:59.840
I think early on-

23:00.880 --> 23:01.440
You do it.

23:01.440 --> 23:06.640
Yeah, I think early on you fall into this trap of going like, well, I pay for the cable

23:06.640 --> 23:10.480
and so you pay for the gas and I'll pay for the thing.

23:10.480 --> 23:15.920
And eventually like after you've been together long enough, all of your money is the same

23:15.920 --> 23:20.000
because like you're paying for dinner or she's paying for the movie or you're paying

23:20.000 --> 23:21.280
for, you know, whatever.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.000
And eventually it's like, listen, let's not keep track.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
This needs paid, you have money right now and I don't, so you pay it.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.080
When we first got together, Teresa and I, like I wasn't making a lot of money because

23:32.080 --> 23:34.400
I was bouncing between part-time jobs.

23:34.400 --> 23:39.280
And so she like paid rent for like the first three or four months we were together and-

23:39.280 --> 23:40.400
That's a lot.

23:40.400 --> 23:44.560
Yeah, but then eventually it just kind of balanced out because then I started paying

23:44.560 --> 23:47.760
for groceries and started paying for, you know, stuff around the house.

23:47.760 --> 23:52.400
And eventually it all balances out in the wash, especially if you're together for like

23:52.400 --> 23:53.760
a long enough period of time.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.640
Eventually it's all going to just even out to zero anyway.

23:56.640 --> 24:01.840
So, you know, what Teresa and I did is we went through and determined how much like

24:01.840 --> 24:06.720
we spent on bills and rent and everything, and then opened a joint checking account.

24:06.720 --> 24:10.400
And then we deposit enough money in it to cover all those things.

24:10.400 --> 24:13.280
Plus a little bit more auto-debit it out every month.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.400
So we don't have to worry about it.

24:14.400 --> 24:18.720
And we're both just feeding money into that account that that way.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.080
We're just paying for it together because-

24:20.080 --> 24:25.120
It's like rounding like, like, you know how you, if you buy something from a store in,

24:25.120 --> 24:31.440
you know, you're round to the cents, maybe the longer you're together, there's a formula

24:31.440 --> 24:36.800
where, you know, at first you would, you would round to like the buck, right?

24:36.800 --> 24:38.800
This is a $64 dinner.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.440
We each need to pay $37 of it.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.680
And then the longer you're together, you round-

24:43.680 --> 24:45.200
You get such a bad job at that.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.040
No, that was pretty good.

24:47.040 --> 24:50.080
You round to the, oh no, it'd be 27, wasn't it?

24:50.080 --> 24:52.640
Or 30, don't worry about it, it's not a big deal.

24:52.640 --> 24:57.760
32, okay, anyway, and then the longer you're together, you know, you round to the teens.

24:57.760 --> 25:02.160
Like you, you spent $40 on the movie and tomorrow I'll spend $40 on dinner.

25:02.160 --> 25:05.520
And then after you've been together for a couple of years, then you round it like to

25:05.520 --> 25:06.720
the thousands.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.880
You spent a thousand on rent.

25:08.880 --> 25:09.760
I spent nothing.

25:09.760 --> 25:10.960
Rachel and I are up to the bills.

25:11.840 --> 25:12.880
To the billions.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.080
We're up to the billions, yeah.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.760
You spent a billion on that private jet.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.120
I don't know how much that cost.

25:19.120 --> 25:19.680
A billion.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.520
That's a billion round billion.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.560
And I bought three Bugattis for 300.

25:24.560 --> 25:27.040
I'm at a point where it's like, that is expensive.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.720
It's probably a billion dollars.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.160
Yeah, oh, a Bugatti?

25:30.160 --> 25:34.720
It's probably 333 repeating million dollars, I would assume.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.800
You could probably get three of those bad boys for a clean bill.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.040
For a Boog?

25:39.040 --> 25:40.080
Oh, for a Boog?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.200
For a Boogavinsky?

25:41.200 --> 25:45.840
Where are you guys at now as far, like, do you think that once you're married is the

25:45.840 --> 25:49.600
time to transition to like, it doesn't matter whatsoever?

25:49.600 --> 25:53.280
Or do you think that there's still a divide?

25:53.280 --> 25:58.080
Because I think once you're married, especially once you're married, it hits a point.

25:58.080 --> 26:02.160
And listen, if you're the type of couple that decides just to live together forever and

26:02.160 --> 26:04.480
marriage isn't important to you, this also includes you.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.600
Once you've made that commitment, there are people out there who do not believe in the

26:07.600 --> 26:08.640
institution of marriage.

26:08.640 --> 26:09.920
I'm talking to you too.

26:09.920 --> 26:17.360
Once you hit that point, like, your survival and thriving in life becomes so intertwined

26:17.360 --> 26:23.680
that it's like, I will also pay for the gas so that you do not stall out on the highway

26:23.680 --> 26:29.120
later because that would also be bad for me because our lives are intertwined so deeply.

26:29.120 --> 26:35.360
I don't want to pay for this, but I also don't want to be married and or permanently tied

26:35.360 --> 26:41.520
to a bag person, some sort of person out on the streets.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.480
I can't have that.

26:42.480 --> 26:45.040
I have to keep you financially solid to a certain extent.

26:45.040 --> 26:50.000
Because it's not like having a roommate if your if your wife or husband or significant

26:50.000 --> 26:52.960
other can't afford to pay rent, but you can.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.720
I'm very sorry, sweetheart.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.920
Time to start looking for a new roommate.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.080
Rachel, did you eat all those Doritos?

27:04.960 --> 27:07.120
I thought those were my Doritos.

27:07.120 --> 27:07.920
I labeled them.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.760
I paid for those with my money.

27:09.760 --> 27:10.400
We joke.

27:10.400 --> 27:15.440
OK, I just made that goof, but like, well, I don't really give a shit about who spends

27:15.440 --> 27:16.240
what on what.

27:16.960 --> 27:20.560
If Rachel ate my goddamn Doritos, I would probably be pretty upset about that because

27:20.560 --> 27:22.560
it's clearly not for I mean, they're Doritos.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.000
She doesn't typically eat those.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.400
I bought those because I knew she didn't eat them.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.760
And I got excited about Domitos is what they were.

27:31.280 --> 27:32.160
Fomitos.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.120
They were they were Yoritos in the Spanish sense.

27:37.120 --> 27:46.160
I I don't think there's a time when I feel more like a fat person than when I eat food

27:46.720 --> 27:53.680
that I did not realize was not communal marriage food, but rather my wife's food, her food.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.480
And I ate it and I didn't know.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.480
And then I realized, I mean, you did.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.920
You did know.

27:59.920 --> 28:00.560
Hold on.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.400
How often does that happen?

28:02.400 --> 28:05.680
Like if it's like, OK, a good example is leftovers.

28:05.680 --> 28:08.880
We're not super good at like leftover consumption.

28:09.440 --> 28:13.520
So sometimes I'll eat her leftovers and she and I don't realize like I think I'm being

28:13.520 --> 28:15.120
a good boy, right?

28:15.120 --> 28:15.920
Justin's good.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.120
You're cleaning out the fridge.

28:17.120 --> 28:20.240
Clean out the fridge and put it in my belly fridge.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.800
We've talked we talked about this like three episodes ago.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.960
OK, I think we had different positions on it.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.560
So I guess we're still evolving as people.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.080
We grow.

28:28.080 --> 28:28.880
We grow people.

28:28.880 --> 28:29.440
We change.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.040
We're growing.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.160
Let's go to the money zone.

28:32.160 --> 28:33.360
Hey, that's a pretty good intro.

28:33.360 --> 28:36.720
OK, and a fart noise for color.

28:37.520 --> 28:38.400
How about this?

28:38.400 --> 28:41.680
Might I invite you to the money zone?

28:41.680 --> 28:42.320
That's way better.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.280
You sound like a warlock.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.960
And you can't see me, but I did the full arm wave and turn.

28:46.960 --> 28:47.440
I heard it.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
OK, I just want to make sure my blocking was clear.

28:50.000 --> 29:09.200
I can't see so good because I'm getting old and I've been hesitant about going to the store,

29:09.200 --> 29:12.560
you know, because I don't I don't want to let that because it's the most humiliating

29:12.560 --> 29:14.480
fucking thing ever trying on glasses.

29:14.480 --> 29:19.520
Yeah, and the paps are outside waiting to snap a few pics of me in my glasses and then

29:19.520 --> 29:21.200
it'll be all over the gossip rags.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.440
Griffin, you wear the glasses.

29:23.440 --> 29:27.680
The last time you were in a glasses store trying them on, do you not feel like just

29:27.680 --> 29:31.120
the the stupid I put them all on looking yourself in the mirror,

29:31.120 --> 29:36.160
as you greening on your face and making like I like the you know how we all do like a smile

29:36.960 --> 29:40.480
in the mirror that you do that you like practice your smile.

29:40.480 --> 29:45.440
So you look less like a creep and more like Sean from Boy Meets World.

29:46.320 --> 29:47.440
Let me just mention real quick.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.280
This is an advertisement for Warby Park.

29:49.280 --> 29:52.800
No, we're going to get to the advertising, but I'm saying I want them to feel like they're

29:52.800 --> 29:53.840
getting their money's worth.

29:53.840 --> 29:56.160
I go to this is part of your ad Warby Park.

29:56.160 --> 29:59.520
I went to the glasses store and I had to like put on each pair of glasses and do that.

29:59.520 --> 30:00.720
Sean from Boy Meets World smile.

30:00.720 --> 30:03.440
It made me look like the biggest fucking creep.

30:03.440 --> 30:06.240
I went the last time I went and bought another vignette.

30:06.240 --> 30:06.880
Fantastic.

30:11.520 --> 30:12.720
My wife was not with me.

30:12.720 --> 30:16.880
And the number of times I put on glasses and looked at the employees of the store and said,

30:16.880 --> 30:17.760
does this look good?

30:17.760 --> 30:20.880
Like I was the most helpless human being.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.120
Like I clearly can't gauge my own appearance.

30:23.120 --> 30:26.560
You don't have to live like Travis Seymour because there's Warby Parker.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.880
Glasses shouldn't cost as much as an iPhone.

30:28.880 --> 30:34.640
They've got fashionable, fashionable frames starting at ninety five dollars.

30:34.640 --> 30:35.280
Not just frames.

30:35.280 --> 30:38.320
I should mention they include the lenses too.

30:39.440 --> 30:41.840
That's an amazing deal for anyone who's ever bought in a store.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.240
Ninety five dollars for frames and lenses.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.040
It's fantastic.

30:45.040 --> 30:49.120
I mean, what they do is they've got a home try on program.

30:49.120 --> 30:52.400
You can get five pairs of glasses and they're going to ship them to you.

30:52.400 --> 30:56.880
You pick the ones you like and you ship the rest back.

30:56.880 --> 30:57.840
There's no obligation.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.360
It's free to ship them.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.600
It's it is not not even a big deal.

31:04.080 --> 31:07.280
The only problem is that all the glasses come to your door and they're covered in caramel.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.560
It's not accurate.

31:10.560 --> 31:11.760
You have to clean all the caramel off.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.440
You can put them on your face.

31:13.440 --> 31:18.720
Well, they got them secondhand from that store that got washed over with that wave of caramel.

31:18.720 --> 31:20.800
That's what they sell them to you at discount prices.

31:20.800 --> 31:24.400
Yeah, Warby Parker dot com slash my brother.

31:24.400 --> 31:24.720
They don't.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.400
The caramel thing wasn't true.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.600
It is basically true.

31:27.600 --> 31:27.920
But here.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.840
Wait, before we move on, here's something that is true.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.320
That's very awesome for every pair of glasses sold.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.800
They distribute a pair of glasses to someone in need.

31:34.800 --> 31:38.320
So you're buying glasses for yourself and helping someone out at the same time.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.280
In need of in need of caramel thing that they don't

31:41.280 --> 31:43.600
check to see if the prescription matches.

31:43.600 --> 31:46.320
No, so they just hand them out and people go, I don't need glasses.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.040
Like, you're welcome.

31:47.040 --> 31:47.440
Shut up.

31:47.440 --> 31:48.400
You look like Rivers Cuomo.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.120
You look awesome.

31:49.120 --> 31:49.920
Shut up.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.120
Except for this caramel.

31:51.120 --> 31:55.440
You look like if Rivers Cuomo is somehow coated in like caramelized.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.120
You're like you're like the sticky face.

31:57.120 --> 31:59.040
Rivers Cuomo, the developing world.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.560
Now wear your sunglasses.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.080
Rivers of caramel Cuomo.

32:04.400 --> 32:08.560
If you go to Warby Parker dot com slash my brother, you're going to get free three day shipping.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.840
So that's really nice.

32:09.840 --> 32:13.520
And you should go, you know, check it totally out.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.920
Warby Parker dot com slash my brother.

32:15.920 --> 32:16.640
Go now.

32:16.640 --> 32:18.160
Go, go, go.

32:18.160 --> 32:18.880
Do it.

32:18.880 --> 32:23.120
Speaking of caramel, let's talk about nature box.

32:23.920 --> 32:25.040
Friend of the show.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.160
I think they're so excited.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.440
We've had a number of people.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.520
Yeah, I'm finally trying it.

32:29.520 --> 32:30.320
And that's exciting.

32:30.320 --> 32:31.440
But at the same time, I want to go.

32:31.440 --> 32:32.000
What do you mean?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.400
Finally, we've been talking about what took you so long.

32:34.400 --> 32:35.440
Six months.

32:35.440 --> 32:38.960
What is it we said we said to you?

32:38.960 --> 32:39.920
I know what I said.

32:39.920 --> 32:40.480
How did we?

32:40.480 --> 32:41.040
How did we?

32:41.040 --> 32:44.960
OK, all right, guys, I'm looking at this month's new snacks.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.000
They are amazing.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.120
Well, what we got you some of these new snacks.

32:49.120 --> 32:52.400
Sea salt pop pops pop pop.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.400
Whole wheat strawberry figgy bars.

32:54.400 --> 32:58.480
OK, how about this dark cocoa num nums?

32:58.480 --> 32:59.520
Excuse me.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.720
Chocolate quinoa granola.

33:03.840 --> 33:04.800
Maple habanero.

33:04.800 --> 33:08.800
The shit out of this just because of your fun, your fun accents that you're

33:08.800 --> 33:09.040
doing.

33:09.040 --> 33:11.520
Maple habanero pretzel pops.

33:13.520 --> 33:14.320
I know.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.680
The praline pumpkin seeds.

33:16.480 --> 33:17.120
Are those good?

33:17.760 --> 33:18.880
God, it's amazing.

33:18.880 --> 33:20.800
People at NatureBox asked me what snacks I wanted.

33:21.440 --> 33:22.400
They're going to send me a box.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.360
Like, I want all of them.

33:23.360 --> 33:24.240
You're getting free bows?

33:25.600 --> 33:26.720
All these look amazing.

33:26.720 --> 33:27.680
I'll share with you guys.

33:27.680 --> 33:28.480
Yeah, sure.

33:28.480 --> 33:29.600
Yeah, you sure fucking will.

33:29.600 --> 33:30.080
Can't wait.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.560
Coffee kettle popcorn.

33:32.560 --> 33:33.280
Like, goddamn.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.840
So NatureBox is it's all healthy and stuff.

33:35.840 --> 33:42.640
There's no there's no GMOs, no trans fat, no hard fruit, just no HMOs.

33:45.280 --> 33:48.640
You can choose wherever you want to go to the doctor with NatureBox.com.

33:48.640 --> 33:50.720
It's true, but you will never need to again.

33:50.720 --> 33:51.920
That's our guarantee.

33:51.920 --> 33:52.960
It's so fucking funny.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.360
What's funny is like you won't even need to go to Warby Parker because you'll

33:55.360 --> 33:57.680
eat the fucking snacks and suddenly your eyesight will get better.

33:57.680 --> 33:58.560
Your vision's red.

33:58.560 --> 34:00.400
These are fashion Warby Parkers.

34:00.400 --> 34:01.520
I don't need them anymore.

34:01.520 --> 34:06.320
Check out my fashion Warby's.

34:06.320 --> 34:08.800
They'll send you a whole box of snacks.

34:08.800 --> 34:12.560
You can eat the whole thing in one sitting and call the newspaper and tell them you're

34:12.560 --> 34:14.160
a disaster.

34:14.160 --> 34:16.800
Then take off your Warby so you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror.

34:16.800 --> 34:22.800
Take off your Warby so you don't have to see the pile of self-mess you've created and are

34:22.800 --> 34:23.680
now living in.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.520
Don't eat them all at once.

34:26.240 --> 34:27.920
They're healthy, but nothing's that healthy.

34:27.920 --> 34:31.040
Get one of the boxes to like eight people and just slam jam them.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.840
If you drink water that much, you'll get water poisoning.

34:33.840 --> 34:37.360
Nothing is that healthy that you could eat an entire box of it in one sitting.

34:38.160 --> 34:42.560
Anyway, naturebox.com is healthy.

34:42.560 --> 34:47.520
You're going to go to naturebox.com forward slash my brother and they'll give you 50%

34:47.520 --> 34:49.040
off your first box.

34:50.240 --> 34:52.560
You can spend that on buying another box.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.120
You disaster because you ate the first one.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.160
Under a different name.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.440
My name is Bustin Lackalroyd.

34:59.440 --> 35:01.680
I love your salt caramel pop pops.

35:02.480 --> 35:03.200
Same address.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.160
I am best friends and roommates.

35:08.160 --> 35:11.920
Just make sure you put apartment one and then apartment two and they'll never know.

35:11.920 --> 35:14.800
I'm going to erase apartment one because that won't get there.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.080
It's just a single family residence.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.400
But yeah, 50% off.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.880
You will really like these snacks, so stay full, stay strong.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.120
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

35:23.120 --> 35:27.120
That's naturebox.com slash my brother.

35:27.120 --> 35:29.920
I got a message for Brian from Sarah.

35:29.920 --> 35:34.000
Brian, happy 10th anniversary and one year-ish until our wedding.

35:34.720 --> 35:37.200
Thank you for all the random hilarity you add to my life,

35:37.200 --> 35:40.560
not including introducing me to the McElroy family of podcasts.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.640
I fucking love the sound of that, by the way.

35:43.280 --> 35:46.720
Now I finally understand the random laughter coming from the kitchen while you do dishes

35:46.720 --> 35:47.760
wearing headphones.

35:47.760 --> 35:50.000
Also, thanks for always doing the dishes.

35:50.000 --> 35:50.480
Love you.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.400
Ah, that's so nice.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.240
Man, should we expand our empire?

35:54.240 --> 35:57.760
So like the idea of the McElroy family of podcasts.

35:58.560 --> 36:01.120
I've been thinking about getting into like drug running and numbers.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.080
How would that help our podcast empire?

36:04.080 --> 36:06.000
Oh, no, I was just thinking like a family empire.

36:06.000 --> 36:06.880
You were just thinking-

36:06.880 --> 36:08.000
Like Boardwalk Empire?

36:08.640 --> 36:10.720
I haven't watched that show.

36:10.720 --> 36:11.280
Me neither.

36:12.320 --> 36:14.240
Okay, so, okay.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.040
Brian and Sarah, happy 10th anniversary.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.040
Happy, man, that sucks dick, doesn't it?

36:19.040 --> 36:20.880
That you guys like spend all that time.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.800
You racked up 10 years and then after you get married,

36:22.800 --> 36:24.160
you have to start right back at one, right?

36:24.720 --> 36:26.000
Just like the Brian McKnight song.

36:27.600 --> 36:30.160
This next one is, well, let me pronounce this name correctly.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.360
Master Brit Brad Jamison.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.560
And that message is from Justin Steve.

36:37.520 --> 36:42.720
Justin Steve say, happy 25th one up birthday to he who gives good beard,

36:42.720 --> 36:45.040
great beer and mad super boops.

36:46.160 --> 36:46.480
What?

36:47.200 --> 36:49.280
What could you be talking about?

36:49.280 --> 36:52.080
How does one give good beard?

36:52.080 --> 36:54.160
That is very confusing to me, Master Brett.

36:54.960 --> 36:55.360
Brad.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.520
Is it Brett or Brad?

36:58.720 --> 37:01.040
Brad is his nom de plume.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.320
Brad's his stage name.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.440
Jess and Steve, they are-

37:05.440 --> 37:07.120
Please, Brett was my father.

37:07.120 --> 37:07.840
Call me Brad.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.040
Gosh, Brett, 25.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.080
That's a great birthday.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.680
It says 25 plus one up.

37:15.680 --> 37:17.120
So I'm wondering if it's maybe 26.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.760
Oh, he's gonna be 25 for a while.

37:19.760 --> 37:20.720
Is that it?

37:20.720 --> 37:22.080
Is that it, Master Brett?

37:22.080 --> 37:23.600
Is that what's going on?

37:26.160 --> 37:28.160
Happy birthday, Brad.

37:28.160 --> 37:28.960
Brad.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.240
No, Brad is 32.

37:31.120 --> 37:32.560
Brad's my older dad.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.520
He was seven when he had me.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.000
Hey, Ross.

37:38.000 --> 37:38.640
Hey, Carrie.

37:38.640 --> 37:40.000
Hey, it's me, your co-host.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.120
Oh yeah, we have a show, don't we?

37:41.120 --> 37:42.000
We have a show.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.840
Oh No, Ross and Carrie.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.640
It's about undercover investigations of fringe groups.

37:46.640 --> 37:49.040
Yeah, like the Tony Olomo Ministries cult.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.880
Yep, that's led by a pedophile.

37:50.880 --> 37:51.680
He's in jail.

37:51.680 --> 37:52.880
He's in jail.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.360
Also, we became Mormons.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.600
We became Raelians, which is a UFO group.

37:57.600 --> 37:58.160
That's right.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.320
We joined the Ordo Templi Orientis.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.400
Yes, the 9-11 truthers.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.120
We got cupped.

38:03.120 --> 38:04.080
We got acupunctured.

38:04.080 --> 38:04.880
We got rakey.

38:04.880 --> 38:07.840
We've pretty much anything that you've heard of and been like,

38:07.840 --> 38:09.520
that doesn't sound quite right.

38:09.520 --> 38:10.560
We've done that.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.000
So you don't have to do it.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.880
So if you want to hear about this, and you should,

38:14.880 --> 38:22.000
then go to maximumfun.org.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.200
We are taking a moment out from our regularly scheduled program.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.680
Every once in a while on My Brother, My Brother, Me,

38:29.680 --> 38:31.360
we like to welcome someone who actually

38:31.360 --> 38:33.520
knows anything about anything.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.720
None of the three of us fill that criteria.

38:37.520 --> 38:39.680
But our guest today certainly does.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.800
John Roderick is a musician.

38:42.800 --> 38:44.800
He is a podcaster.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.320
He is an author.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.720
He is a raconteur.

38:48.720 --> 38:54.000
A raconteur, a friend, a father figure to some, myself included.

38:54.000 --> 38:54.800
An herbalist.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.080
An herbalist.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.720
John Roderick, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me.

38:58.720 --> 38:59.680
Thank you, fellows.

38:59.680 --> 39:00.240
Hello.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.920
Are you actually an herbalist or is Travis talking out of his ass?

39:03.920 --> 39:06.640
No, everything that you said about me is 100% true.

39:06.640 --> 39:09.440
That's also the name of John's autobiography.

39:09.440 --> 39:10.560
That's the full title.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.000
Everything you just said about me.

39:12.000 --> 39:12.880
The full title.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.160
Is 100% true.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.360
The John Roderick story.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.960
Herbalist Secrets in the back, in the index.

39:19.680 --> 39:22.960
We asked the audience for questions for you

39:22.960 --> 39:24.720
and we left it very open-ended.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.080
Because you're an open-ended man.

39:26.960 --> 39:27.440
Well.

39:27.440 --> 39:28.320
I think that's fair to say.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.600
And we got a lot of, what would you say, Travis?

39:31.600 --> 39:32.100
Duds?

39:36.320 --> 39:37.840
Well, no, see, this is the thing, guys.

39:37.840 --> 39:41.520
You know, like, what you might think is a dud question

39:41.520 --> 39:43.760
might either be, I mean, first of all,

39:43.760 --> 39:44.960
could be a coded message.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.640
Warning you about your impending death.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.280
Well, or-

39:49.280 --> 39:51.920
Or to activate you like my Manchurian candidate style.

39:51.920 --> 39:52.400
That's right.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.440
Or it might be one of my agents checking in with me.

39:56.960 --> 40:00.640
So what you might interpret as a dud could be something,

40:00.640 --> 40:03.840
you know, just that you don't understand, too sophisticated.

40:04.400 --> 40:07.440
Or it might be a question that you think is a dud

40:07.440 --> 40:09.360
because you haven't heard my answer yet.

40:09.360 --> 40:10.400
That's true.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.880
It is just the spark that will light the fire

40:12.880 --> 40:14.240
of your intellect and wisdom.

40:14.240 --> 40:15.200
Yeah, you didn't have me-

40:15.920 --> 40:17.040
Travis, maybe you should read the worst one.

40:17.040 --> 40:21.120
You didn't have me on the show to try and get interesting

40:21.120 --> 40:22.800
questions from your ding-a-ling readers.

40:23.520 --> 40:23.680
No.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.800
You had me on the show to answer questions

40:26.800 --> 40:28.240
from your ding-a-ling readers.

40:28.240 --> 40:29.600
I guess they're not readers, are they?

40:30.720 --> 40:32.080
Some of them probably do read.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.000
They just read the transcripts.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.720
Yeah, that's the way to really, that's how you get the comedy.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.200
I like to imagine what their voices sound like.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.960
It would just be like, it'd be like a sentence

40:42.960 --> 40:44.320
and then it would be sniffle noise

40:44.320 --> 40:46.320
and then another sentence and then sniffle noise.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.400
Justin opens bag of pretzels.

40:50.400 --> 40:52.960
I try to get them all out, but fuck, guys,

40:52.960 --> 40:55.520
we are very nasally productive people.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.040
Poorly masked flatulence.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.320
Here's our first question for you, Mr. Rodger.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.000
Okay, I'm a musician.

41:02.000 --> 41:10.560
Dear John, I am everyone who's ever asked you anything ever.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.280
This is not me.

41:13.280 --> 41:14.960
This is another person who is.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.760
Justin is something of a musician, I would say.

41:18.400 --> 41:22.880
Let's, listen, I can play you my Long Winter's covers

41:22.880 --> 41:26.400
after we're done recording and you can pick the best one.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.480
Yeah, that'll be a separate episode

41:28.480 --> 41:30.960
where you play me your music and I...

41:30.960 --> 41:35.040
No, I play you my version of your music

41:35.040 --> 41:36.880
and you tell me if you think I got it.

41:36.880 --> 41:39.040
And then you do our bits.

41:39.040 --> 41:39.280
Okay.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.520
And then you do our bits.

41:41.520 --> 41:41.920
Classic.

41:42.480 --> 41:43.360
I'm a musician.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.560
I make this noise music.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.240
It fits well in the cliche of atonal ambient noise,

41:50.240 --> 41:53.200
although it's got a drive to it that's accessible.

41:53.200 --> 41:55.040
And I like to think I transcend the norm,

41:55.040 --> 41:56.720
but I'm just not getting heard.

41:56.720 --> 41:59.280
I know the music is all about the art of persistence.

41:59.280 --> 42:02.000
So do you have any tips on how I can sell myself,

42:02.000 --> 42:05.520
how to solicit venues for gigs, how to get paid?

42:05.520 --> 42:08.720
Should I spam my poor Twitter following more hashtags?

42:08.720 --> 42:10.800
That's from Amy Vibes in Vermont.

42:12.080 --> 42:12.640
What do you think?

42:14.880 --> 42:16.640
It doesn't sound very good, does it?

42:16.640 --> 42:17.680
I mean, just between us.

42:17.680 --> 42:18.960
Well, not really selling it.

42:18.960 --> 42:22.880
You know, yeah, there's a lot of underselling language for sure.

42:24.480 --> 42:28.560
I mean, using the word cliche to describe your own tunes is,

42:28.560 --> 42:33.120
I don't know, I feel like that's maybe a cultural signifier.

42:33.840 --> 42:36.080
They don't want to seem like they're too hungry.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.960
I also, I think the term noise music,

42:38.960 --> 42:40.080
and I understand that it's a genre,

42:40.080 --> 42:42.080
but it's always sounded so pejorative to me.

42:42.080 --> 42:42.400
Yeah.

42:42.400 --> 42:44.720
Because that sounds like noise is what like

42:44.720 --> 42:48.720
your shitty upstairs neighbor calls the music that you produce

42:48.720 --> 42:49.840
if they're shitty enough.

42:49.840 --> 42:50.080
Right.

42:51.520 --> 42:52.880
The neighbor, not the musicians.

42:52.880 --> 42:53.440
But you know,

42:53.440 --> 42:55.360
just downstairs making some noise music.

42:55.360 --> 42:57.840
Yeah, I play racket.

42:57.840 --> 42:58.720
You don't play racket?

42:58.720 --> 43:01.760
I feel like noise music, though, I mean, it's such a broad,

43:01.760 --> 43:02.640
it's like indie music.

43:02.640 --> 43:03.920
It's sort of a meaningless word.

43:04.640 --> 43:07.360
And it could, I mean, half the soundtracks these days

43:08.000 --> 43:10.960
are what you would call noise music, right?

43:10.960 --> 43:13.200
I mean, what is the soundtrack to,

43:14.560 --> 43:17.840
what the hell was that movie with the, about the-

43:17.840 --> 43:18.400
Me, Dave.

43:19.040 --> 43:19.600
Goodfellas?

43:19.600 --> 43:20.160
No.

43:20.160 --> 43:20.640
Gattaca?

43:20.640 --> 43:21.680
Goodfellas, that was good music.

43:21.680 --> 43:24.480
No, the one about the goal or the oil miner.

43:24.480 --> 43:27.360
Extensiz, extin, existence.

43:27.360 --> 43:30.000
No, no, no, there's gonna be blood.

43:30.000 --> 43:30.960
There's gonna be blood.

43:31.840 --> 43:33.280
I swear to you, there will be blood.

43:33.280 --> 43:34.480
That was a lot of noise.

43:35.200 --> 43:37.760
Yeah, it was all punk, tank, tank, tank.

43:37.760 --> 43:40.320
And it sounded like, it sounded a lot of like,

43:40.320 --> 43:42.480
that's what the, that's what an oil,

43:43.040 --> 43:44.960
like an oil well sounds like.

43:44.960 --> 43:47.760
That's what it sounds like inside the head of an oil well.

43:47.760 --> 43:50.160
Let me ask you this question from this question,

43:50.720 --> 43:51.760
because now it's got me thinking.

43:53.360 --> 43:57.200
Is there a certain truth to, if you start making music, right?

43:57.200 --> 43:57.840
Yeah.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.280
If it takes off immediately,

43:59.280 --> 44:00.960
if people seem to like it right away,

44:00.960 --> 44:02.480
you know you've got something.

44:02.480 --> 44:05.360
But if after like a couple years, you're still going,

44:05.360 --> 44:08.720
hmm, I just don't feel like I'm getting heard and it's growing.

44:09.280 --> 44:12.240
Is that like, you know, the world's way of going,

44:12.240 --> 44:13.200
maybe it's not good.

44:13.760 --> 44:14.240
No.

44:14.240 --> 44:15.840
Maybe, maybe you got no future in this.

44:15.840 --> 44:16.640
Not necessarily.

44:16.640 --> 44:20.000
I feel like the, I feel like what happens is that,

44:20.640 --> 44:22.960
I mean, anytime you've heard of a music scene,

44:22.960 --> 44:26.080
that scene is already over.

44:26.080 --> 44:26.880
Or you know what I mean?

44:26.880 --> 44:29.360
Like that scene is not accepting any new members.

44:30.560 --> 44:30.880
Right.

44:30.880 --> 44:31.440
That scene's full up.

44:31.440 --> 44:31.680
Right.

44:31.680 --> 44:34.560
By the time, by the time anyone has heard of a scene,

44:34.560 --> 44:36.720
it's like, sorry, too late to join that scene.

44:36.720 --> 44:39.600
But that's, for most musicians, that's all,

44:40.640 --> 44:41.760
you know, that's your reality.

44:41.760 --> 44:42.800
You look at a scene and you're like,

44:42.800 --> 44:44.400
well, I kind of identify with that scene.

44:44.400 --> 44:46.960
I would like to be a part of that, but it's like, no chance.

44:46.960 --> 44:49.040
That, that, those doors are closed.

44:49.040 --> 44:51.040
Then why do people still make rock music,

44:51.040 --> 44:53.120
which is the oldest music ever.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.720
That's why it's called, it's called rock.

44:54.720 --> 44:56.240
It's as old as rocks.

44:56.240 --> 44:56.960
It's that.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.480
I think what ends up happening is that

45:02.480 --> 45:04.560
the way to get, the way to get into,

45:05.920 --> 45:07.920
the way for people to hear your music is,

45:07.920 --> 45:12.480
it's very rare that somebody just makes genius music.

45:12.480 --> 45:14.240
And I mean, this is the fantasy, right?

45:14.240 --> 45:16.240
I used, my ex-girlfriend used to say to me like,

45:16.240 --> 45:19.120
well, if your music is any good, you'll just make it.

45:19.120 --> 45:21.920
And then people will come running and it's like, wow.

45:21.920 --> 45:24.720
Yeah, because you're going to play it super fucking loud.

45:24.720 --> 45:26.880
You're going to buy the biggest speakers ever.

45:26.880 --> 45:27.440
Right, right.

45:27.440 --> 45:28.880
You're going to, you know, you're going to just,

45:28.880 --> 45:31.120
I mean, her version of reality was that like,

45:31.120 --> 45:33.360
oh, somebody is going to hear you playing.

45:33.360 --> 45:35.200
They're going to be walking by your house

45:35.200 --> 45:36.880
and hear you playing and they're going to happen

45:36.880 --> 45:38.000
to be a record executive.

45:38.000 --> 45:38.640
Sure, kid.

45:38.640 --> 45:39.360
Yeah, exactly.

45:39.360 --> 45:41.440
I mean, isn't that true of everybody who like,

45:41.440 --> 45:44.480
wants to be an actor in movies or make paintings?

45:44.480 --> 45:46.960
All I need is for someone to see it.

45:46.960 --> 45:49.360
All I need is for someone to see it.

45:49.360 --> 45:51.920
I'm a video game journalist, which is sort of like

45:52.560 --> 45:54.320
the rock stars of fat people.

45:54.320 --> 45:54.720
Sure.

45:54.720 --> 45:57.600
And even that is, even that is like,

45:57.600 --> 45:59.520
you hope you're going to get discovered

45:59.520 --> 46:01.360
and you hope you, you make it.

46:01.360 --> 46:04.400
But I still tell people that if you work really hard at it

46:04.400 --> 46:06.400
and you're doing something really good,

46:06.400 --> 46:07.840
that the, the cream.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.280
It's not really, not what happened to you though.

46:09.280 --> 46:09.840
Rise.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.200
Is that like naive of me?

46:11.200 --> 46:14.880
Some dude saw you kill a can of Pringles

46:14.880 --> 46:16.240
six chips at a time.

46:16.240 --> 46:19.760
And they're like, oh, buddy, eat no more.

46:19.760 --> 46:20.480
You have made it.

46:21.040 --> 46:23.600
I feel like what happens is anybody that makes it

46:24.160 --> 46:28.000
then, then revises their origin story

46:28.640 --> 46:31.280
and takes out all the parts of their origin story

46:31.280 --> 46:32.320
where they're like, well, you know,

46:32.320 --> 46:35.680
my mom really helped me a lot and my dad gave me eight grand.

46:36.240 --> 46:40.160
And then I, and it turns out that I knew a guy who knew a guy

46:40.160 --> 46:43.200
who knew a guy who got me on an elevator with a guy.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.360
Like none of that is very interesting.

46:45.360 --> 46:49.360
And it, and it, and people mistakenly feel like

46:49.360 --> 46:51.440
they want to erase that part of their story

46:52.480 --> 46:55.680
because it makes them, because it exposes the degree

46:55.680 --> 46:58.240
to which you need a leg up or, you know,

46:58.240 --> 47:00.640
it exposes their advantage, however small.

47:00.640 --> 47:01.680
That's why I like The Voice.

47:02.240 --> 47:03.680
I mean, there's a, there's, don't get me wrong.

47:03.680 --> 47:05.520
There's a lot of reasons why I like The Voice.

47:06.160 --> 47:06.480
I'm sure.

47:06.480 --> 47:11.440
But when I watch The Voice every Tuesday night at 730.

47:11.440 --> 47:12.320
And then again, Wednesday.

47:12.320 --> 47:14.640
And again, Wednesday morning.

47:14.640 --> 47:16.960
You just use this one of the advertisements

47:16.960 --> 47:18.800
that you like subtly put into the show.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.960
Is this how you guys get rich?

47:20.960 --> 47:22.480
We're hoping to get free episodes.

47:22.480 --> 47:23.600
When you watch The Voice.

47:24.960 --> 47:26.000
That's how we get paid.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.120
It's a partner system.

47:27.120 --> 47:29.600
When you watch The Voice on Fox at 730.

47:29.600 --> 47:30.880
They sent us exclusive clips.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.600
Nobody doesn't know where like

47:33.600 --> 47:35.600
that Soul Patrol dude came from.

47:35.600 --> 47:38.320
He came from like season 15 of American Idol.

47:38.320 --> 47:39.440
You know where he came from.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.720
You know his whole backstory.

47:41.360 --> 47:42.320
There's no guesswork.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.800
And well, so then it sounds to me like

47:44.800 --> 47:46.400
what she's asking there at the end

47:46.400 --> 47:49.280
is that she shouldn't be embarrassed to say like,

47:49.280 --> 47:50.800
hey, if you guys like this,

47:50.800 --> 47:52.080
make sure to tell your friends

47:52.080 --> 47:53.280
if you want to come see a show.

47:53.280 --> 47:55.840
I mean, the problem with that is that,

47:56.400 --> 47:57.920
you know, you cannot go out

47:57.920 --> 48:02.480
and personally shake the hand of 30,000 people

48:03.600 --> 48:06.240
and count that every one of those people

48:06.240 --> 48:08.880
is going to hear and love your music.

48:08.880 --> 48:11.600
You know, I feel like music has always

48:11.600 --> 48:12.800
and even in the internet,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.400
future land that we're occupying now.

48:16.400 --> 48:17.600
The shitty wasteland.

48:18.240 --> 48:19.120
The shitty wasteland.

48:19.120 --> 48:21.200
But the reason you hear about bands

48:21.200 --> 48:23.280
is that they are part of a community

48:23.840 --> 48:26.240
of other musicians and you like one

48:26.240 --> 48:29.440
and then you're drawn to see

48:29.440 --> 48:30.560
like who their friends are

48:30.560 --> 48:33.360
and who they associate with.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.400
And most scenes, if you think about it,

48:37.520 --> 48:40.080
most scenes are formed by bands

48:40.080 --> 48:43.040
that are like,

48:43.920 --> 48:45.280
the reason they form a scene

48:45.280 --> 48:47.200
is that they are initially unwelcome

48:47.200 --> 48:49.200
anywhere else, right?

48:49.200 --> 48:52.240
You form a collective of other musicians

48:52.240 --> 48:53.920
who are struggling

48:55.040 --> 48:56.400
because you're living in a world

48:56.400 --> 48:58.240
where it's like, oh, I'm not invited

48:58.240 --> 48:59.440
into these other scenes.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.560
All I have are these other jerks

49:03.600 --> 49:04.560
who are right around me.

49:04.560 --> 49:06.960
You get an Isle of Misfit toys thing going on,

49:06.960 --> 49:08.880
but then eventually it becomes like

49:08.880 --> 49:10.720
a continent of Misfit toys.

49:10.720 --> 49:11.600
That's right.

49:11.600 --> 49:13.600
And every music scene starts out

49:13.600 --> 49:15.120
as an island of Misfit toys.

49:15.120 --> 49:16.240
And most of the time,

49:16.240 --> 49:17.760
those other bands,

49:18.320 --> 49:19.920
maybe they don't sound like you.

49:19.920 --> 49:21.200
Maybe, you know,

49:21.200 --> 49:22.960
maybe you're friends

49:22.960 --> 49:24.480
because you're just proximate

49:24.480 --> 49:25.200
to one another.

49:26.160 --> 49:28.240
But then a scene comes out of it

49:28.240 --> 49:29.920
and other people look at it and go,

49:29.920 --> 49:33.200
actually, there is a connective sound

49:33.200 --> 49:34.400
between these acts

49:35.120 --> 49:36.880
and it ends up being the next,

49:36.880 --> 49:38.560
it ends up being the next sound, you know?

49:38.560 --> 49:39.520
Yeah, maybe we're-

49:39.520 --> 49:41.360
Can you con people into thinking

49:41.360 --> 49:42.320
there is a scene,

49:42.320 --> 49:44.400
sort of like an Emperor's New Clothes type situation?

49:44.400 --> 49:45.840
Oh, the Vermont noise scene?

49:45.840 --> 49:47.760
Oh, it's popping off right now.

49:47.760 --> 49:49.680
If you're not making Vermont noise,

49:49.680 --> 49:50.800
what are you even doing?

49:50.800 --> 49:52.320
It's just leaves rustling.

49:52.320 --> 49:54.000
I feel like every,

49:54.000 --> 49:55.760
I feel like everybody that wants to get

49:55.760 --> 49:58.000
into show business feels like

49:58.000 --> 50:02.640
there's some kind of chemtrails-based conspiracy

50:03.120 --> 50:04.960
that, yeah, it's all a con job.

50:04.960 --> 50:07.280
It's all like, how do I get my, you know,

50:07.280 --> 50:10.480
they're out there buying Facebook likes or whatever.

50:11.360 --> 50:13.600
And I think it's much more likely

50:13.600 --> 50:17.520
that if you go to see bands that interest you

50:18.640 --> 50:21.440
and support your friends,

50:21.440 --> 50:23.200
like, I think you go see music,

50:23.200 --> 50:24.480
first of all, is the number one thing.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.880
You support other musicians

50:26.880 --> 50:28.320
and support music that you like.

50:29.520 --> 50:32.240
Like, all that stuff happens very organically.

50:32.240 --> 50:34.160
And every successful scene I've ever seen,

50:34.160 --> 50:38.240
has come up organically among a group of people

50:38.240 --> 50:40.240
that are going to each other's shows

50:41.280 --> 50:43.920
and share a kind of like-minded desire

50:43.920 --> 50:46.560
to perform a certain kind of music.

50:46.560 --> 50:47.440
And pretty soon, you know,

50:47.440 --> 50:49.040
you're putting on shows where it's like,

50:49.040 --> 50:50.160
I'm playing with my friend's band.

50:50.160 --> 50:51.840
I'm playing with my other friend's band.

50:51.840 --> 50:54.640
You're not worried about penetrating

50:54.640 --> 50:58.160
the big show business capital S

50:58.160 --> 51:00.080
because you're making a little show business.

51:01.040 --> 51:02.880
And then the big show business comes

51:02.880 --> 51:04.240
looking for you.

51:04.800 --> 51:06.240
I've noticed, John, that you have not

51:06.240 --> 51:07.360
to this point mentioned,

51:08.160 --> 51:10.560
put your music into an Apple commercial.

51:11.360 --> 51:13.040
That seems to work.

51:13.040 --> 51:14.720
Yeah, it seems like the easiest thing.

51:14.720 --> 51:15.280
You're right.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.320
It seems like the easier thing.

51:16.320 --> 51:17.200
You're absolutely right.

51:17.200 --> 51:18.960
I should have started off by saying,

51:19.520 --> 51:22.160
first thing you do is get on an Apple commercial.

51:22.160 --> 51:23.120
Just get into one of those.

51:23.120 --> 51:24.080
I got another question for you.

51:24.080 --> 51:25.680
Me and a close-knit group of friends

51:25.680 --> 51:26.720
formed a rock band.

51:26.720 --> 51:28.960
See, see what I'm saying?

51:28.960 --> 51:29.760
Next question.

51:29.760 --> 51:32.640
Travis, Travis, Travis.

51:32.640 --> 51:34.160
That validates my viewpoint.

51:34.160 --> 51:37.360
Travis, go back into the files

51:37.360 --> 51:40.000
and get me something non-music related

51:41.440 --> 51:43.600
as we talk about this next question.

51:43.600 --> 51:43.920
All right.

51:43.920 --> 51:44.160
Okay.

51:44.720 --> 51:46.320
Me and a close-knit group of friends

51:46.320 --> 51:47.120
formed a rock band,

51:47.120 --> 51:48.800
but the problem is our drummer friend

51:48.800 --> 51:52.400
is super flaky and rarely shows up to practice.

51:52.400 --> 51:53.920
I don't want to lose him as a friend,

51:53.920 --> 51:55.280
but we'll never get out of the garage

51:55.280 --> 51:56.400
with him as our drummer.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.640
How do I politely give him the old boot?

51:58.640 --> 52:00.240
And that's from dropping the drummer

52:00.240 --> 52:01.280
in Utah, friend.

52:01.280 --> 52:02.720
You're in Utah.

52:02.720 --> 52:06.080
I feel like this question is based on another

52:07.120 --> 52:09.840
like rock industry myth

52:09.840 --> 52:11.600
and that is that you have to practice.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.120
You just get in a room.

52:15.120 --> 52:16.480
You just, you say like,

52:16.480 --> 52:17.600
this is our sound, our sound.

52:17.600 --> 52:18.560
What's our sound?

52:18.560 --> 52:19.040
Get together.

52:20.080 --> 52:20.880
That's it.

52:20.880 --> 52:21.920
That's our sound.

52:21.920 --> 52:23.040
Let's go smoke some weed.

52:23.040 --> 52:25.040
Let's smoke a bunch of weed and see what happens.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.320
Start designing our logo.

52:27.920 --> 52:28.880
The number one thing-

52:28.880 --> 52:30.400
We start with fog hat covers

52:30.400 --> 52:32.400
and we just cruise into our own sound.

52:32.400 --> 52:32.880
Perfect.

52:32.880 --> 52:34.480
The number one thing any band needs to do

52:34.480 --> 52:36.960
is get out a notebook of lined paper

52:36.960 --> 52:38.320
and start designing your logo

52:38.320 --> 52:42.560
because that's where you're going to get

52:42.560 --> 52:43.840
an Apple commercial, I'll tell you why.

52:43.840 --> 52:44.720
And make sure you have the proper-

52:44.720 --> 52:46.960
And maybe your logo is you

52:46.960 --> 52:48.560
kicking the drummer out the door.

52:50.960 --> 52:53.920
Maybe you have a logo contest in the band

52:53.920 --> 52:56.320
and say whoever draws the worst logo

52:56.320 --> 52:57.760
is out of the band.

52:57.760 --> 52:58.320
Is out.

52:58.320 --> 53:00.320
And even if the drummer is a graphic artist-

53:01.920 --> 53:02.800
I don't get it.

53:02.800 --> 53:04.320
I use my 3D printer.

53:04.320 --> 53:05.600
I created this logo.

53:05.600 --> 53:08.800
It's a building of us playing.

53:08.800 --> 53:10.800
Oh yeah, I like this guy's better.

53:10.800 --> 53:13.360
He drew us as like stick figures all high-fiving.

53:13.360 --> 53:14.160
You're out.

53:14.160 --> 53:14.880
Yeah, you're out.

53:14.880 --> 53:15.440
Sorry, bro.

53:16.080 --> 53:16.640
Sorry.

53:16.640 --> 53:18.240
He drew the Pearl Jam logo.

53:19.040 --> 53:21.920
John, I don't want to unspool this incredible answer

53:21.920 --> 53:22.800
that you just gave,

53:22.800 --> 53:26.640
but does The Long Winters have a logo I don't know about?

53:26.640 --> 53:30.320
I mean, like an Eskimo shrugging?

53:30.320 --> 53:31.600
Like, what gives?

53:32.160 --> 53:35.360
You know, the initial logo was of a guy

53:35.360 --> 53:38.960
in a sort of an Eskimo style coat

53:39.520 --> 53:40.800
pushing a snow blower.

53:41.680 --> 53:44.560
And the snow blower produced a big cloud of snow cloud.

53:45.280 --> 53:48.720
And The Long Winters name was in the snow cloud.

53:48.720 --> 53:49.520
That was our original-

53:49.520 --> 53:50.400
And it dripped blood.

53:51.040 --> 53:51.920
Yeah, that's right.

53:51.920 --> 53:52.240
That's right.

53:53.840 --> 53:55.680
It's not exactly giant lips, is it?

53:55.680 --> 53:56.640
I mean-

53:56.640 --> 53:57.840
No, no, it's not.

53:57.840 --> 53:58.880
And that was the problem with it.

53:58.880 --> 54:00.480
If you look at the Nirvana logo,

54:01.760 --> 54:02.240
the first thing-

54:02.240 --> 54:04.080
Is that the one with the guns and roses in it?

54:06.080 --> 54:08.240
No, that was the Alice in Chains logo.

54:08.240 --> 54:10.480
The Nirvana logo is just the name Nirvana

54:10.480 --> 54:11.600
in some kind of font.

54:12.480 --> 54:13.120
And your first thought was-

54:13.120 --> 54:14.400
I think it was the Wingdings.

54:14.400 --> 54:15.440
Is it Wingdings font?

54:16.400 --> 54:17.680
It's not Comic Sam.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.600
It's an edgy fucking band, man.

54:19.600 --> 54:21.360
They invented a sound and Wingdings.

54:21.360 --> 54:22.960
You look at it and your first thought is

54:22.960 --> 54:25.840
Nirvana is the stupidest band name

54:25.840 --> 54:27.120
in the history of band names.

54:28.320 --> 54:29.680
It seems reasonable now,

54:29.680 --> 54:32.960
but when those guys from Aberdeen, Washington

54:32.960 --> 54:34.160
were like, we're Nirvana?

54:34.960 --> 54:35.920
Totally ridiculous.

54:37.200 --> 54:38.640
But it looked good.

54:39.680 --> 54:42.400
It was in a font that just looked right

54:42.400 --> 54:47.040
and they put that same exact logo on everything they did.

54:48.640 --> 54:50.880
And that's why they took off.

54:50.880 --> 54:51.200
That's right.

54:51.200 --> 54:53.200
Look at them compared to the Long Winters.

54:53.200 --> 54:53.520
Yeah.

54:53.520 --> 54:57.120
Who had some inscrutable Eskimo on there,

54:58.400 --> 54:59.440
and it's just like,

55:00.160 --> 55:01.760
by the time I got to Snow Cloud,

55:01.760 --> 55:02.880
you guys weren't even listening.

55:04.080 --> 55:04.560
That's true.

55:04.560 --> 55:06.240
I was thinking about the letters dripping blood.

55:06.240 --> 55:06.880
Yeah, yeah.

55:07.520 --> 55:09.840
But in answer to this person's question,

55:11.040 --> 55:14.080
the number of bands I've seen that have believed

55:14.800 --> 55:18.560
that the integrity of the original lineup

55:18.560 --> 55:22.320
or the core group was paramount.

55:24.880 --> 55:28.880
And so they kind of willfully refused

55:28.880 --> 55:30.720
to acknowledge that one of the guys

55:30.720 --> 55:33.040
was not committed to being in the band

55:33.600 --> 55:37.120
and that person was just committed enough

55:37.120 --> 55:39.520
that they would be willing to stick around

55:40.080 --> 55:43.280
and thwart the band's ambitions time and time again

55:43.280 --> 55:44.640
until all was destroyed.

55:44.640 --> 55:44.880
Sure.

55:44.880 --> 55:48.480
That's a very common problem in collaborative work.

55:48.480 --> 55:51.360
Like this person doesn't love the band enough

55:51.360 --> 55:53.200
to recognize that they need to quit

55:54.240 --> 55:55.280
for the band to do well.

55:55.280 --> 55:57.360
I mean, that sounds like the saving grace to me

55:57.360 --> 56:00.240
is he's not saying, hey, our drummer sucks.

56:00.240 --> 56:02.320
Like he's super committed and he's always the first one

56:02.320 --> 56:03.600
at practice and the last one to leave,

56:03.600 --> 56:04.880
but he's just dumb.

56:04.880 --> 56:07.120
Like you've got a great door opening to say like,

56:07.120 --> 56:09.520
hey, Bill, do you remember how you haven't been here

56:09.520 --> 56:10.800
for the last six weeks?

56:10.800 --> 56:11.440
Yeah, out.

56:11.440 --> 56:13.280
No, you shouldn't make him make him play

56:13.280 --> 56:16.880
a show with you do like the actor's worst nightmare shit.

56:16.880 --> 56:18.800
Like get him on a stage on practice.

56:18.800 --> 56:20.400
He doesn't even know the songs.

56:20.400 --> 56:21.440
You're playing like a slow ballad.

56:21.440 --> 56:24.320
He's giving you like a good and you're like,

56:24.320 --> 56:27.040
oh man, he's not going to want to even perform music anymore

56:27.040 --> 56:28.480
after this embarrassing time.

56:28.480 --> 56:29.760
But then to be fair, he's the drummer.

56:29.760 --> 56:31.680
So he's walking out going nail that perfect.

56:31.680 --> 56:32.320
Exactly.

56:32.320 --> 56:33.120
That is the problem.

56:33.120 --> 56:36.000
The drummer is going to be like, whoa, did you see my,

56:36.000 --> 56:37.360
did you see my performance?

56:38.640 --> 56:39.520
That was amazing.

56:39.520 --> 56:40.000
I don't know.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.760
You guys must not have seen that.

56:41.760 --> 56:43.760
You guys must not have seen that thing you do

56:43.760 --> 56:44.880
because the way that it shakes out

56:44.880 --> 56:46.400
is that everybody instinctually starts

56:46.400 --> 56:47.600
playing with the drummer.

56:47.600 --> 56:49.120
Tom Hanks loves it.

56:49.120 --> 56:50.000
You're famous.

56:50.000 --> 56:50.640
You're huge.

56:50.640 --> 56:52.000
I guess it works either way.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.880
I mean, your point about not adhering to the original lineup

56:56.880 --> 56:59.040
genre reminds me of something I was reading about just today.

56:59.040 --> 57:01.280
I was reading up on the band The Suite or Sweet.

57:02.080 --> 57:04.560
You may know from Ballroom Blitz fame.

57:05.440 --> 57:07.360
The Suite had four guys in it.

57:08.320 --> 57:10.000
Two of the guys died.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.800
The other two guys are now performing as individual suites

57:15.680 --> 57:17.760
in the US and the UK.

57:17.760 --> 57:18.320
Uh-huh.

57:18.320 --> 57:19.600
They have franchised.

57:19.600 --> 57:20.880
They have splinter-celled.

57:20.880 --> 57:22.960
They have splinter-celled The Suite.

57:22.960 --> 57:25.120
And half the band is dead.

57:25.120 --> 57:29.600
The other half have basically asexually reproduced.

57:29.600 --> 57:29.920
Right.

57:29.920 --> 57:33.200
And half the members, twice the band.

57:34.320 --> 57:35.920
Sweet UK, Sweet US.

57:35.920 --> 57:36.560
Mm-hmm.

57:36.560 --> 57:39.760
That's not, and that's not just resilience.

57:39.760 --> 57:40.160
That's resilient.

57:40.160 --> 57:41.120
That's creating jobs.

57:41.120 --> 57:41.360
Yeah.

57:42.560 --> 57:44.480
I mean, that's super common in rock and roll, right?

57:44.480 --> 57:46.880
I mean, what the hell is Creedence Clearwater Revisited?

57:47.760 --> 57:52.000
It's the three guys minus the guy that wrote all the songs

57:52.000 --> 57:54.080
and sang them and played all the guitar parts.

57:54.080 --> 57:57.200
It's like if you keep swapping out members of Crosby, Stills,

57:57.200 --> 57:58.960
Nash, and Young, and actually you don't even notice,

57:58.960 --> 58:00.080
you don't know any of these guys.

58:00.080 --> 58:00.400
Yeah.

58:00.400 --> 58:01.920
Or the Commodores.

58:01.920 --> 58:03.600
How many original Commodores are there left?

58:03.600 --> 58:07.920
It's like one guy from the Commodores, his son, his son's

58:07.920 --> 58:09.920
friend, his son's friend's dad.

58:09.920 --> 58:11.520
One master general, one.

58:11.520 --> 58:12.320
I like it.

58:12.320 --> 58:12.960
Yeah, exactly.

58:12.960 --> 58:17.920
Like the postman, like the postman's dog.

58:17.920 --> 58:20.000
It's like it doesn't resemble the original band at all.

58:20.000 --> 58:20.880
Dr. Feelgood.

58:21.600 --> 58:23.280
But listen, you got to fire the guy.

58:23.280 --> 58:24.400
You got to fire the weak link.

58:24.400 --> 58:28.480
I mean, I don't want to introduce any strife into the

58:28.480 --> 58:31.040
my brother and my brother and me podcast.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.680
How do you start that conversation?

58:33.680 --> 58:35.760
If we had, for instance, let's just role play

58:35.760 --> 58:39.200
if we had to have it with Travis, let's just role play.

58:39.200 --> 58:39.360
Sure.

58:39.360 --> 58:40.080
Hold on.

58:40.080 --> 58:40.320
Sure.

58:40.320 --> 58:41.600
Like you got a weak link.

58:41.600 --> 58:42.160
Yeah.

58:42.160 --> 58:43.040
What are you going to say?

58:43.040 --> 58:44.000
Hypothetical, Travis.

58:44.000 --> 58:44.400
Don't worry.

58:45.120 --> 58:46.400
It's a hypothetical, Travis.

58:46.400 --> 58:47.200
We're just picking.

58:47.200 --> 58:48.400
It's any one of us.

58:48.400 --> 58:49.520
Yeah, let me do it here.

58:49.520 --> 58:51.040
I've got three names written on a piece of paper.

58:51.040 --> 58:52.720
I'm going to throw them into the air and catch one.

58:52.720 --> 58:54.000
I caught Travis.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.120
So for instance, in this situation, what I would do is I

58:57.120 --> 58:59.840
would have like a guest expert come on the show.

58:59.840 --> 59:00.640
Interesting.

59:00.640 --> 59:02.000
That you kind of like better.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.920
That's like funnier, quicker than Travis.

59:03.920 --> 59:06.480
We'd have to start doing that, but OK, yeah.

59:06.480 --> 59:07.760
Sounds good so far.

59:07.760 --> 59:08.080
Right.

59:08.080 --> 59:10.480
And then after you establish a rapport,

59:10.480 --> 59:12.080
where Travis just is kind of like trying

59:12.080 --> 59:13.840
to get a word in edgewise and can.

59:13.840 --> 59:14.320
Yeah.

59:14.320 --> 59:14.880
Wait, hold on.

59:14.880 --> 59:16.880
Then it becomes just kind of clear to him

59:16.880 --> 59:17.760
that he's being supplanted.

59:17.760 --> 59:19.280
Maybe it's time to.

59:19.280 --> 59:20.320
How long do you think that would take?

59:20.320 --> 59:23.600
Maybe 21 minutes and 48 seconds-ish.

59:24.640 --> 59:26.560
I think he'd get the point pretty fast,

59:26.560 --> 59:27.440
unless he's a drummer.

59:28.640 --> 59:31.280
John, we wish we could keep talking to you.

59:31.280 --> 59:32.400
Wait, I have one more question.

59:32.400 --> 59:34.800
You guys hear that?

59:34.800 --> 59:36.080
You'll like this.

59:36.080 --> 59:36.960
OK, OK.

59:36.960 --> 59:38.000
Real quick, Travis.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Dear brothers and John Roderick, my girlfriend

59:40.000 --> 59:42.320
refuses to eat chicken unless it's been deboned.

59:45.760 --> 59:48.640
No wings, legs, thighs, nothing unless the bones

59:48.640 --> 59:50.160
are out of sight and out of mind.

59:50.160 --> 59:52.720
She tells me it's because the bones are gross and morbid.

59:52.720 --> 59:54.640
I tell her she is being hypocritical

59:54.640 --> 59:56.240
and should consider vegetarianism

59:56.240 --> 59:57.360
if she can't face facts.

59:57.360 --> 59:59.040
Is my girlfriend being hypocritical

59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.040
and how do I stop picking these dumbfights?

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.440
And that's from Thanks, I Eat the Bones in Texas.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.000
And that is subject line Roderick specifically.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.120
John, have you done anything in your fucking life

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.560
that would make people think that you're

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.800
some sort of weird chicken expert, man?

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.120
As a matter of fact, yes.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.600
I am a chicken fingers eater.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.360
Are you a known?

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:29.200
I have listened to all of your albums back and forth.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.360
I don't think there's a song on one of them

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.480
called Yummy Yum Yum.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.760
I'm a chicken eater, man.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.800
No, no, I keep I keep that part of my life separate.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.200
That's sort of that's that's that's

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.960
on the private premises for you.

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:41.520
That's right.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:46.480
But I, too, share your girlfriend's sort of distaste.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.640
Not I don't think it's gross exactly,

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.640
but like if I were given a plate of chicken tenders

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.440
and next to it was a plate of like whole chicken parts,

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.360
and I prefer the processing because, you know,

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.600
you take a chicken, you have to kill it.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.920
You have to pull the feathers out of it.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.480
You have to wash it and pull all its guts out.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.680
Then you have to chop it up.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.240
Now, that's a lot of processing.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.200
I don't see what is so I don't see why you stop processing

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.560
the fucking thing at that point.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.640
Yeah, you get to like you do feathers

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.400
and then you're basically like, I'm done.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.760
Keep processing it until it's just a pile of meat.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.600
But when you've got bones, you know,

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.440
they're passing the savings along to you.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.280
Yeah, that's the thing you're paying for that bone weight.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:33.920
That's true.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.720
That's another thing.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.000
Like, if I'm going to pay the extra,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.320
I want to pay for the processing of somebody taking all that meat,

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.760
putting it in a little pile, breading it and deep frying it.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.440
I don't want to have to sit.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.480
I mean, I feel like the I feel like eating chicken off

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.760
the bone is the last vestige of like feral.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.880
Like animal instinct that most of us get to experience.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.120
You're sitting you're sitting at your freaking desk all day

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.320
in an air on chair.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.560
You go down to an air conditioned garage and get in your Prius.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.200
You drive to your air conditioned garage in your subdivision.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.640
And then you're eating chicken off the bone.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.680
And you think you're a wild man.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.480
And then you bury the bones in the backyard and shit by the tree.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.360
And your girlfriend is some kind of wuss because she wants

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.880
she wants it to come to her.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:26.160
Like as a Totino's pizza roll, like, yeah, fully processed chicken pills.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.720
She wants she wants someone from what's a chicken company?

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.600
Who does who's good about Dyson, Tyson, Tyson, Tyson, Dyson, Dyson, Dyson.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.600
Mr. Dyson rolls up, chews up the chicken,

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.360
spits it in your girlfriend's mouth.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.560
That's what you want.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.840
That's what you're asking for.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.800
You want chicken paste that is formed into the shape of of little chickens

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.000
like they do at McDonald's.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.520
Yeah, we're stars or dinosaurs. Dinosaurs is fine.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:55.920
John, if you would like to spend more time with John Roger and who wouldn't?

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.000
You have that opportunity.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.120
You can go to boatparty.biz and hop on to the Atlantic Ocean

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.720
Comedy and Music Festival.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.520
John, what's that?

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:12.000
Well, it is a I was not aware how ad driven this podcast was.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.520
It is all for every time we mentioned boatparty.biz.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:18.160
We get a free book. If you can talk about how delicious the Tyson

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.080
chicken served on this boat is going to be.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.160
So you show up on the process.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.520
Is it you show up on the boat?

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.880
The first thing that the first thing that happens is the first thing you see

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.720
is some kind of animal.

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:33.200
The original cruise I went on, it was a lion, sometimes it's a dolphin

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:39.120
carved out of butter, sitting in it, sitting in a bowl of ice next to a

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:39.600
swimming pool.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:44.080
And I mean, that's that's your first impression of a swimming pool.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.600
I mean, that's that's your first impression.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.960
Use your imagination from there.

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:52.320
That is the degree of luxury you are experiencing on even the on even

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.440
the smallest cruise.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:59.120
And boatparty.biz, of course, is a major cruise property.

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.320
Is it fun? Can we go back to the butter?

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.680
I hate to stall out here, but is it functional butter or is this?

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.400
Are you going to be the asshole?

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.560
Is it just a time keeping mechanism?

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.280
If you're the guy who dips in first, are you the asshole?

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.200
I think you just go after that butter.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:19.920
And, you know, what's what ends up happening, I think, is is that they

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.280
use that butter for the rest of the cruise.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.680
Like if you're eating it, if you're eating a scone on the last day of

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.840
the cruise, it came from the dolphin tail.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:28.320
So I go.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.840
OK, so you go nose to tail.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:30.640
Yeah, I go right.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.280
I go right.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:31.680
I go.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.240
I go right for the lion, right for the butter lion.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.440
Just dig right in.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.640
That's how you know you're on the boat.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:41.760
Is there is there any entertainment acts or is it just looking at butter?

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.800
Mostly, I will tell you, I've been on a lot of cruises and the boat party

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:52.640
that biz last year was I mean, it was it was absolutely a singular cruise

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.640
experience, freaking hilarious.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:58.880
It's a it's a small it's a small enough boat that there's a lot of

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.840
interaction with the with the entertainment.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:07.280
There's so much entertainment on the bill that you almost can't help but

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.280
interact with them, because when you go into your state room, there's a

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.080
chance that one of the comedians or musicians is actually going to be

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.760
in there fluffing your pillow.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:20.240
Yeah, that's that's how Chris Fairbanks earned his ticket on board.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:24.720
We had such a hilarious time last year, the last night of the cruise,

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:29.280
the entire like all the performers all jumped in the swimming pool at

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.560
about one o'clock in the morning.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.640
Eugene Mermin was like first in with I think he had a bottle of brandy in

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.480
one hand and maybe like a vape cigarette in the other.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:40.960
Everybody in the pool.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.880
I hope you got home all right.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.320
Oh, yeah, he's fine.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:44.880
He survived.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:49.440
Boat party is just added Todd Barry, who is I think going to be performing

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.840
the Eugene Mermin role this year of embarrassing himself in a pool.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.440
Yeah, although although he will not have a bottle of brandy or a vape

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:02.160
cigarette or get in the pool, but otherwise he will be he'll be the

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.440
spark that ignites it.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.000
Yeah, that's right.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:08.560
Now, Joe, we're not going to be on the cruise, so can you describe it

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:12.080
again but make it sound worse and shittier so I don't feel so bad?

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:14.720
Let's see.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:20.800
The city of Nassau, Bahamas feels a little dangerous.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.120
It's a beautiful paradise, John.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.720
It's a beautiful paradise.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:28.560
But but yeah, it's you know, it's it's a little bit.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:33.440
It has that shabby chic of a of a of that is so characteristic of the

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.320
Mediterranean.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.640
It was a valiant effort, but the whole thing is going to be magical.

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.080
Last year on Nassau, I rented a I rented a scooter and drove to the

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.960
other side of the island with a beautiful girl on the back.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.840
And we got caught in a brief warm rainstorm.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:51.040
If that makes it so that we were both just soaked to the bone.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:54.560
Oh, it was so bad.

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:58.400
That sounds like the day that Bill Murray talks about wishing he had

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.400
instead of Groundhog Day and Groundhog Day.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.720
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.920
I got soaked and my my iPhone got wet.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.520
Oh, no.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.960
So that now when I take it in to have it serviced, they give me the

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.720
stink eye at the Apple store.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.360
Does that make is the phone still wet, John?

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.440
From last year, it still works.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.400
But, you know, they have some litmus paper in there that's like, oh,

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.600
this phone is pregnant and you can't it won't get fixed anymore.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.240
If you get it wet after midnight.

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:28.720
Yeah, right.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.880
They're giving you the stink eye because your phone smells like the

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.000
funnest thing to ever happen and they didn't get to go.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.040
Well, what happened is it would turn from a Mowgli into a gremlin.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.760
And now I have to deal with this fucking angry gremlin phone all the

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.080
time.

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:43.920
John Roderick, thank you so, so much for joining us on our show.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.640
It is it is a a real pleasure.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:52.720
BoatParty.biz is where people can go if they want to spend some time

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.600
with you.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.720
Personal time.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:57.120
Me and many other great performers.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.480
So many others.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.120
And you're on Twitter, of course.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.080
John Roderick, that's R-O-D-E-R-I-C-K.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.320
Is there anything else you would like to promote?

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.520
Do we still announce being on Twitter as though it's something?

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.360
That not everybody is already doing.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.480
Let me check my notes here.

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.640
You're on something called Twitter?

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.400
I just don't want people to have to look for you.

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.240
I want them to just have a direct line to your to your feed so they can

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:22.560
follow.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:25.680
At John Roderick on Twitter, you should listen to my podcast, which is

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:29.200
called Roderick on the Line, which is not part of the Maximum Fun

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:31.440
Network for reasons that are unclear to me.

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.040
But I am just a I'm just a lonely soldier in the world.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.880
We can't afford we can't afford Merlin.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.000
His his writer is like, believe me, I know it's it's absinthe all the

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:42.480
way down.

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.680
But yeah, that's right.

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.360
I do a podcast with Merlin Man.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.000
And yeah, I'm just you know, I'm part of the the general fabric of the

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.720
American sub entertainment business.

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.080
And you will see me in your town at some point.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:56.880
You'll see him.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.440
Are you going to are you going to I know you've been I know you've been

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:03.040
playing playing some shows up in the up in the Pacific Northwest.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.920
Are you planning on doing that more countrywide?

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.720
Good question.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.760
Well, I'm going on a cruise.

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.720
Did I tell you about that?

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.120
Right.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.040
Is that cruise coming to Austin, fucking Texas?

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.720
Are you going to park the boat in Lady Bird Lake?

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.640
You know, why the hell is that called a lake?

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.680
It's a fucking river.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.440
It's a I mean, it is a lake.

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:19.920
It's close.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.080
You put it you put a dam on a river.

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.280
I guess you can call it a lake.

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.560
It still looks like a river.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.960
It's a fucked up river, but it's the slowest moving.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.880
They can't call it Lady Bird fucked up river.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.200
This is the greatest podcast.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:31.700
All right.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.680
No, we will come to Austin.

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:38.640
We'll come to Austin very soon because, you know, Austin loves the long

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.280
loves the long winters and we love Austin.

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.000
We love you.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.480
Thank you so much for joining us, Mr.

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.480
Roderick, John, if you don't mind.

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.280
Thank you, bros.

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:48.820
Sure.

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.080
And I think there's more show after this.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.080
So let's go back to the show.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.560
That is also us.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.680
It'll be just like this.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.200
How about a Yahoo?

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.340
Quickie.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.800
This who was sent in by Drew.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.280
Thanks, Drew.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.560
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.200
They've been deleted.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.040
They ask, do you ever get scared?

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.200
Your parents might find out about Sims 4.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:18.240
I'm assuming they mean Sims 3 because obviously Sims 4 is not yet.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:22.560
But I am very much looking forward to the new create a Sim system with dynamic face dragging.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.560
Watch the trailer.

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.120
It looks great.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.240
This face dragging.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.040
It looks out of control.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.880
It has woohooing and stuff in the game, but I don't do that stuff except woohooing to make kids.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:36.480
I get scared my parents might find out and I may not be able to play it anymore.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:40.080
That's why I limit my woohooing, kissing, hugging, and touching.

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:43.280
I tell my parents my Sim is single and she's not ready to mingle.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.520
When they ask, who's the guy in the house?

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.320
I ask them what guy they're talking about until they leave me alone.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.480
Jesus Christ.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.520
I only woohoo to make kids.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.680
I don't throw this out.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:58.320
When you first asked the question, Griff, I was like, I don't know.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:58.820
I don't know.

01:10:58.820 --> 01:10:59.320
I don't know.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:10:59.820
I don't know.

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:00.320
I don't know.

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:00.820
I don't know.

01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:01.320
I don't know.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:01.820
I don't know.

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:02.320
I don't know.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.160
When you asked the question, Griffin, I was afraid you meant something like,

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.800
I'm afraid my parents will find out about Facebook and start using it and contacting all my friends.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:09.560
Well, yeah.

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:12.800
But you don't want your parents woohooing on the side.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.760
You want to only know that they woohooed once.

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.480
And then you were born.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.520
To make you.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.480
That's the ideal.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.080
They could somehow, like, genetically woohoo

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:25.760
so that none of their Sim bits actually touch, but that would be wonderful.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:31.280
You, uh, while Griffin was reading this question, my connection broke up so I didn't hear it.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:40.280
And I was going to stop and say something, assume it, but I decided not to, assuming that I would be able to assemble the question through context clues.

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:44.280
That is becoming increasingly unlikely, it seems.

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.280
No, this will be fun. This will be like a board game.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:58.280
So, I think, I mean, if I was a parent and I saw my kid woohooing and kissing, hugging, and touching virtual boys or girls,

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:03.280
I would say, I don't care if your sim is single and not ready to mingle.

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:08.280
I'm not interested in watching you do this, because I have to watch everything you do on your computer.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.280
Because if I look away for a second, you'll be abducted.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:16.280
Through the computer, like in Captain Man. You'll be sucked right into the screen.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:19.280
You'll be sucked in. Mother brain will fucking snatch you up.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.280
Also, like, several issues of Are You Afraid of the Dark, I believe.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:25.280
Yeah, there's basically the plot of every other Are You Afraid of the Dark.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.280
I would be willing to bet that if this is a big enough of a problem for this question asker,

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:34.280
that their parents keep bringing this up, they're already pretty worried about it.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.280
Yeah.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:43.280
If it's enough that you have to constantly explain to your parents that while your sim is single, she is not ready to mingle,

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.280
the parents are going, what the fuck is wrong with our kid?

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:50.280
Can we all admit how we play The Sims right now for once and all and settle it?

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:55.280
We all start it like, oh, I'm going to start it and I'm going to recreate the house I live in.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:00.280
Or maybe I'm just going to pick up some architectural studies and test out what kind of crazy MCS or shit I can make.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.280
He was the guy who made all the buildings.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:06.280
And then, you know, maybe I'll make a boat or something.

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.280
Or maybe, you know what, I'm going to have a guy that's really good at guitar and he becomes the most famous guitarist on the earth.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.280
That's what I'm going to do.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:17.280
And then 15 minutes later, you're trying to get your sim to fuck everybody in town. Everybody.

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.280
I feel like it is like a psychological test that if you watch someone play Sims, they're either going to end up,

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:27.280
A, being the most boring, all-knowing, all-powerful being in the world.

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.280
They're going to, B, spend all their time trying to make their Sims fuck.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:35.280
Or, C, they're going to put walls up around a Sim and make them pee themselves and die.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:40.280
I'm going to download the celebrity skins so they look famous.

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:45.280
And I'll lock, like, Greatest American Hero and MC Hammer in a room.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.280
And MC Usher.

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.280
And MC Usher.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.280
MC Usher.

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:52.280
And then you make them all fuck.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:55.280
And then you put a fireplace in the room.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.280
I'll take care of them.

01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:03.280
That's what Kanye West, when he wrote the album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, that's what he was talking about.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.280
About Sims?

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.280
It was about that.

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:09.280
Literally that situation we just described.

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:12.280
MC Usher, MC Usher, MC Hammer, and the other one.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.280
Fucking in a fiery inferno.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:19.280
Can you make your Sim look like a nun?

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.280
Is that a possibility?

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:26.280
I mean, you can, and it'll just make it more scintillating when that nun breaks the habit, if you know what I mean.

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:30.280
I mean, she takes all of her clothes off.

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.280
When she takes off her clothes, she's not a nun anymore.

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.280
Come on, Griffin.

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.280
I guess you're right, that's how it works.

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:38.280
That's why all nuns stink like shit.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:42.280
It's true.

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.280
You ever seen a nun just walk through the car wash?

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.280
Man, I want to play some Sims now.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:47.280
Yeah, I know, right?

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.280
Do you guys remember Sims Online?

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.280
That shit was fucked up.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.280
Yeah, it was real fucked up, because that game was like The Sims.

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.280
Everyone's trying to fuck, but guess what?

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.280
There's people on the other end, real life people.

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.280
Hello.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.280
Hello, how are you?

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.280
Good to meet you.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.280
Oh, internet?

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.280
Sure.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.280
Fuck me.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:06.280
I fucked you.

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.280
We did it for real.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.280
If you fuck in the game, you fuck in real life.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.280
The Sims Online, brought to you by EA.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:15.280
You're going to love fucking the internet.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.280
It's like EverQuest, but it's going to leave you bone dry.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.280
Folks, that's going to do it for us.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.280
Thank you so much to, well, I mean, John Roderick, but we thank you every week.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.280
Right.

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:33.280
Triple thanks, with sugar, to John Roderick for joining us on this program.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.280
We haven't recorded that interview yet, so I hope he has lived to this point to actually record it.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:44.280
Well, more likely, I hope we don't fucking pee our pants, and then you can hear the pee in the recording.

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.280
So thank you to him.

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.280
Thank you to you for listening to the program.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.280
You can follow John Roderick.

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.280
We probably did the plugs, didn't we?

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.280
Do you think?

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.280
In the past?

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.280
In the past?

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.280
Our future selves?

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:01.280
We should mention again to go to BoatParty.biz.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.280
Think about it.

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:06.280
Think about it real hard, because it's going to be a goddamn slam dunk.

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:17.280
Thanks to people tweeting about the show, like Jesse, Don Chappell, Epinards and Caramel, so many others.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.280
You're all fantastic.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:25.280
And we haven't, I don't know that we've ever mentioned this, but if you'd like to get some more information

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:30.280

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:33.280
Hey, we have one of those.

Let us know that you're going to be there so we can call you out.

And then let's get some mad bro grabs going afterwards.

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.280
Let's get it going.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.280
Let's get it popping.

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.280
And that's going to do it for us here.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.280
My Brother, My Brother, Me, Griffin, you got a last question for us.

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.280
Got this final one.

So many good ones.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:01.280
All right.

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.280
Final question.

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.280
Yahoo was sent in by Zach Bomb.

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.280
Thank you, Zach.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:11.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Erica, who asks, oh, what is a marijuana nugget?

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.280
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.280
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.280
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.280
This has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.280
Kiss your dad.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.280
Square on the lips.

Morgan Murphy.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.080
I don't know if you guys know what a facelift is.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:38.920
When they take your face skin and they peel it away from your face, and in that little

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:42.800
space there, that's where they find your self-esteem.
