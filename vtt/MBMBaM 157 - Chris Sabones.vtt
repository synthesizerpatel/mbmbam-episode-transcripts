00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:48.080
Hello, everyone. Welcome to my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern

00:48.080 --> 00:55.680
era. Before we get into the advice this week, just want to give a huge welcome, a welcome aboard

00:55.680 --> 01:03.520
to the new official house chef for my brother and my brother and me productions,

01:03.520 --> 01:12.880
my bim-bim prod, Ms. Paula Dean, Bella of the South. God, guys, these craft services are,

01:12.880 --> 01:19.520
they're just, they're hard to get through. They require- This Krispy Kreme lasagna is delicious.

01:19.520 --> 01:25.040
There's a lot of chewing, a lot of crunching, a lot of snapping and smacking of the jaws and gums.

01:25.040 --> 01:30.720
A carnival of textures. Now, I know what you're wondering, friends at home. Paula Dean,

01:31.920 --> 01:39.840
she's a bigot. Wait, that's exactly right. She is. You are correct. You are correct about that.

01:40.400 --> 01:47.200
Although, you know, all she did was use a couple, what are words? Think about it. We give words

01:47.200 --> 01:52.320
their power, you know what I mean? We give words their power, and for us, the words have given us

01:52.320 --> 01:58.800
the power to get Paula Dean at an extreme discount. It's, we're talking about extreme

01:58.800 --> 02:07.440
restraints, coupon code, sexabunga levels of cheapness. Just really a great value. It's sort

02:07.440 --> 02:16.320
of a house strategy here, my brother, my brother and me. We employ famous racists. That's kind of

02:16.320 --> 02:26.480
our thing, because once they're outed as really racist, see, we're all white, so it's not as much

02:26.480 --> 02:31.440
of a thing where we're afraid they're going to malign us. Right, because we know we can get away

02:31.440 --> 02:37.600
with it ultimately because of our obscene privilege. Exactly. So with our straight white

02:37.600 --> 02:44.480
male privilege and ability to suss out bargains, we can get deeply discounted racists. I mean,

02:44.480 --> 02:51.360
we got Paula Dean for a song. I mean, she's fantastic. She's cooking up a storm. That song

02:51.360 --> 02:58.400
was written by Lynyrd Skynyrd too, because she is holy shit sexual. That song was Song of the South,

02:58.400 --> 03:03.360
was the one that we got her for. Can you guys think of any other, I'm trying to think who else

03:03.360 --> 03:11.040
on staff we picked up for being really. Well, we got Mel Gibson. Oh, wow. That was a huge steal.

03:11.040 --> 03:19.440
He was a, and as my suggestion to you, if you need security for an event or let's say a live

03:19.440 --> 03:26.000
podcast, I highly recommend Mel. I mean, you can't have him now. He's ours. He does terrific,

03:26.000 --> 03:31.200
terrific work. It's not so much that he is physically imposing, but yes. Although I don't

03:31.200 --> 03:36.880
know, he's kind of, I want to say disintegrated a little bit since the beaver. Maybe he's not

03:36.880 --> 03:45.040
quite as burly as he once was in a, say a science, but man, he is just, nobody wants to be around him.

03:45.040 --> 03:49.840
Like nobody wants to sort of even enter his field of view. So like he's a very effective

03:49.840 --> 03:59.920
bouncer and security man in that sense. We've also had great success with Michael Richards.

03:59.920 --> 04:05.840
Not only keeps us in stitches, but keeps our laundry looking really, really clean. He does

04:05.840 --> 04:10.880
some punch up. And then when we don't need the punch up, which is never, he'll, you know,

04:10.880 --> 04:15.840
he'll clean off the mics for us. He'll get, he'll, he'll change the spit filters. Is that a thing in

04:15.840 --> 04:21.280
a mic? Ironically, you know, the only problem I've had with him doing our laundry, what's that? He's

04:21.280 --> 04:26.560
not so hot at separating the whites, which is surprising to me. You would think that that would

04:26.560 --> 04:31.920
be a strong thing for him. That would be a thing. This is shocking. What was it? What was the shit

04:31.920 --> 04:36.960
he said? What was it? I promised myself I'd never forget the shit he said right after he said that

04:36.960 --> 04:42.960
shitty shit on the stage. And then he, he like tried to like play it off. Like it's words of

04:42.960 --> 04:49.520
power. These are, these are the things that we say like dog, you need to fucking, you know,

04:49.520 --> 04:55.040
you have finished, you have, you have completed. That's where you just go, well, I'm done. Bye,

04:55.040 --> 05:04.320
everybody. We also got Garrison Keillor, which is weird, not a racist, but I don't think his agent

05:04.320 --> 05:09.440
knew that. So it worked out pretty well for us. We got him at racist rates. Let's just put it that

05:09.440 --> 05:14.640
way. We've been trying to get him to say some racist stuff. Nothing. He just won't do it. Huh?

05:14.640 --> 05:22.000
No, wait, no, not right now. No dog. No, I don't need a massage right now. Dog the Bounty Hunter.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.960
Thank you. Is Dog the Bounty Hunter not? Yeah. Dog the Bounty Hunter, uh, uh, racist, but big hands.

05:28.960 --> 05:34.240
Yeah. Strong hands. Great for a massage whenever you need him. Is this our most slanderous intro

05:34.240 --> 05:40.560
ever? Uh, everything we've said has been a joke. Parody, fair use, less than a minute.

05:40.560 --> 05:47.680
Garrison Keillor is a huge racist. Garrison Keillor hates people of any color, any color.

05:47.680 --> 05:52.800
Discriminate with his hate. If they're not translucent, if they're not ghosts, Garrison

05:52.800 --> 05:58.560
Keillor is, is just not interested in communing with them. Uh, by the way, I'm Justin McElroy and

05:58.560 --> 06:02.480
I'm your oldest brother. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm your middlest brother. I'm Griffin McElroy. I'm

06:02.480 --> 06:07.920
your, I'm your sweet baby brother. Uh, this is our Revice Show where we help people and not just

06:07.920 --> 06:14.640
disadvantaged racists, uh, former celebrity racists. Well, okay. Former celebrity current racists. It's

06:14.640 --> 06:20.800
kind of a co-op of, of current celebrity racists. Uh, we got a little bit of everybody here, uh,

06:20.800 --> 06:24.960
but, but let's, let's start to help people or else our entire support system is for naught and

06:24.960 --> 06:30.080
how else are we going to, uh, keep them in the lifestyles which they become accustomed?

06:30.080 --> 06:36.880
The hate, the hateful lifestyle. The hateful lifestyle. I love my job. However, it is an

06:36.880 --> 06:42.400
unusual occupation. I'm a seamstress for a company that makes costumes and accessories for anime fans,

06:42.400 --> 06:47.680
furries, and bronies. And yes, Griffin, we make Pokemon costumes. I don't know why you need,

06:47.680 --> 06:51.680
like, why- My problem is that- Why you putting Griffin on blast? My problem is that during a

06:51.680 --> 06:57.920
small talk with strangers, no, sorry, my problem is during small talk with strangers, not a small

06:57.920 --> 07:03.120
talk with strangers, uh, people always ask what you do, which causes all sorts of problems. Some

07:03.120 --> 07:08.640
people assume I'm into these things, which I'm not, or it results in me answering tons of questions,

07:08.640 --> 07:13.600
usually the same. What should I do, brothers? Uh, should I just lie about my job or is there

07:13.600 --> 07:19.600
a quick sentence that can explain my job without the assumptions or repetitive questions that's

07:19.600 --> 07:24.160
from Gmail? There's no shame in lying about you. I lie about my job all the goddamn time.

07:24.720 --> 07:30.400
Yeah, me too. If you're over 60, you do not know what I do. Nope. I am a special interest. I am

07:30.400 --> 07:35.600
a pop culture journalist. If you, if that, seriously, I've dropped that on them. Um,

07:35.600 --> 07:41.280
I write about electronics. That's that lends itself to, again, I'm not ashamed of my job

07:41.280 --> 07:46.800
if you're not my people. I've had the, I've had the lie trying to explain what a podcast is to

07:46.800 --> 07:52.080
people. And it always ends up just being like, I'm on an internet radio show and that's about it.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.120
Right. Cause if you don't have to, if you don't have to explain what a podcast is,

07:55.120 --> 08:02.000
then people already know who you are. Yes. My job is easier to explain when I don't talk about what

08:02.000 --> 08:06.800
I actually do, which is I'm the managing editor of a video game website. That's not like management

08:06.800 --> 08:10.480
is not actually that hard for people to comprehend. But I usually just say that I review video games

08:10.480 --> 08:16.880
because a that's more glamorous and be easier to explain. Uh, but when some people don't even

08:16.880 --> 08:22.720
comprehend that, so I end up saying, uh, well, you know how like Roger Ebert did for movies?

08:22.720 --> 08:26.400
Oh no. I do that for video games. And then I realized one day I said that I was like,

08:26.400 --> 08:31.120
wait a minute. Is that's right. I'm the Roger Ebert of video games.

08:31.120 --> 08:35.760
But I feel like every games writer does that. So every games writer is the Roger Ebert of

08:35.760 --> 08:39.440
video games. There's, there's a point of diminishing returns on that analogy.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.760
Imagine trying to explain that you don't write reviews. You write news and people are like,

08:43.760 --> 08:47.440
I don't, why, how can there be news about this thing? I don't give a fuck about.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.800
Right. There is trust us. There's lots. There's so much.

08:51.360 --> 08:55.840
How, what about this? What about you just stare them dead in the eye and say, I enable fantasy.

08:55.840 --> 09:06.080
Ooh, I am a dream maker. I enable dreams to come birthed from the dreamscape to corporeal.

09:06.080 --> 09:12.480
I am the modern day. I am the modern day Geppetto. I'm a Geppetto bringing your fantasies to life.

09:12.480 --> 09:18.960
And then this is essential. Do not expound. In fact, don't speak anymore. If you can speak,

09:18.960 --> 09:23.120
don't leave the room. Don't exit the conversation. Just do not respond.

09:23.120 --> 09:27.360
If you can pull a fushigi ball out of your pocket and start twirling it around like in labyrinth

09:27.360 --> 09:31.440
and talk about how you make fantasies come true. If you can just be dressed up like Jareth.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.480
No one will talk to you. That'll be good.

09:34.480 --> 09:37.600
Yeah. And also you won't have to explain what your job is because people will just be like,

09:37.600 --> 09:39.600
oh, he's a, he's a troll king.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.440
A costumer. People understand that.

09:41.440 --> 09:46.720
Yeah. A costume seamstress or you make, you make costumes for people. Do you really need to go

09:46.720 --> 09:52.240
into the individual? Like when someone asks me what I do, I say that, you know, I'm a theater

09:52.240 --> 09:56.320
technician and then I don't go on to explain what I build.

09:56.320 --> 10:01.600
Yeah. You don't have to say that you like take regular dog costumes and you sew dicks onto them.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.600
You don't have to mention.

10:03.600 --> 10:07.360
Oh, that was hateful. Not all of the furry culture is about sex. I'm sorry.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.240
I can't believe I fell into that pitfall so quickly.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.160
We've gotten so much better over the years.

10:12.160 --> 10:16.080
I know I have gotten so much better. And I honestly, I understand that community.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.400
It was a closed minded statement and I apologize.

10:18.400 --> 10:23.600
And to that community, that was a joke. It was a loving joke that we were laughing at with you.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.400
So join in.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.520
I don't think they're laughing. I don't think they're laughing. We're laughing with someone,

10:27.520 --> 10:29.520
but it's, I don't think it's them. And I think I fucked up.

10:29.520 --> 10:32.800
Can we say that they take anime costumes and sew dicks onto them?

10:33.520 --> 10:35.920
Well, every costume should have a dick on it somewhere.

10:35.920 --> 10:36.320
Right.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.760
Otherwise, why are you making a costume?

10:37.760 --> 10:41.440
This is a beautiful My Little Pony costume. Could I get a dick on it?

10:41.440 --> 10:43.120
Can you just slip a dick in there?

10:43.120 --> 10:47.840
Just wherever. Yeah. It doesn't have to be anatomically correct. Just

10:47.840 --> 10:50.480
under the armpit is fine. Just put a dick on there.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.320
Let's get off the dick.

10:54.640 --> 10:54.880
Done.

10:55.840 --> 11:00.480
I can totally understand where this person is coming from. And I would honestly,

11:00.480 --> 11:06.000
I think if you just say, I am a costumer, people will sort of get where you're coming from and

11:06.000 --> 11:12.080
they will think that it's fun. You do not have to go into the specificity of what type of Pokemon

11:12.080 --> 11:22.880
costumes you do sell. But if you have Vulpix, hit me up. My number is 512-5528. Vulpix. It's 512

11:22.880 --> 11:27.200
Vulpix. And then just get me back to that. I'm not interested in Ninetales.

11:27.200 --> 11:32.080
Or you can email him at Vulpix or it didn't happen at gpale.com.

11:32.080 --> 11:32.560
Right.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.480
Sorry, Travis. Did you say gpale?

11:34.480 --> 11:35.120
I did.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.400
That's true. That's where you send me-

11:38.400 --> 11:39.760
I was enjoying my joke so much.

11:39.760 --> 11:46.240
You send me pictures of real human beings in Vulpix costumes,

11:46.240 --> 11:49.040
and then I put them in the gpale, which is to say the garbage pail.

11:50.640 --> 11:54.080
I will file it right there. Thank you. No, I'm just kidding. Hit me up with the price.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.440
Gpale's priority taken.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.240
Gervin, how about a Yahoo answer?

11:58.240 --> 11:58.800
I can do a Yahoo answer.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.480
Yahoo answer servers.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.200
We got a lot in this week. Thank you to everybody who sent this in.

12:03.200 --> 12:08.320
This one was sent in by Daniel Geller. It's by Yahoo answer's user,

12:08.320 --> 12:10.640
Economics Dickey, who asks,

12:12.400 --> 12:14.480
what does an average American look like?

12:16.320 --> 12:18.400
What does an average American look like?

12:19.600 --> 12:20.640
That was the headline in the body.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.000
Paula Deen, do you want to take this?

12:24.160 --> 12:25.120
She just says, why?

12:27.120 --> 12:27.520
Fat.

12:28.080 --> 12:28.800
Oh, Paula.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.880
We got to be careful here because we do not want to come off as

12:34.880 --> 12:43.680
as either racial, gender, hetero, age normative in any way.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.000
There's got to be a way to thread this needle without-

12:46.800 --> 12:47.840
Oh, God bless.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.280
There's got to be some amount of-

12:49.280 --> 12:50.800
What does an average American look like?

12:50.800 --> 12:51.440
Delicacy.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.600
I think we can say big.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.560
I think we can say, we don't have to say fat, but big.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.200
There's a lot to the average American.

12:59.200 --> 13:04.560
Confident in, nope.

13:04.560 --> 13:05.840
You say confident.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.320
I feel that, but it's not really a physical attribute,

13:10.320 --> 13:12.400
unless it's the way that they're carrying themselves, their posture.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.240
You look at someone, you look at their deportment,

13:14.240 --> 13:15.840
and you say, well, that's a confident somebody.

13:15.840 --> 13:16.560
You look at their what?

13:18.160 --> 13:20.480
Their deportment, how they carry themselves.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.200
I don't understand why you want to deport all the Americans.

13:25.280 --> 13:25.760
You know what?

13:25.760 --> 13:29.120
One thing I've found is that my view of what the average American looks like

13:29.120 --> 13:32.320
has been extremely skewed by where I live,

13:32.320 --> 13:38.320
which is in West Virginia, where people are more rotund as a rule.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.600
I am a gentleman of some heft myself,

13:41.600 --> 13:45.520
but I am trying to shed those LBs, first off, number one.

13:45.520 --> 13:51.440
Number two, I'm not, for here, I'm pretty good.

13:51.440 --> 13:52.560
Yeah, you're doing great.

13:52.560 --> 13:55.120
For where I live, I'm pretty good.

13:55.120 --> 13:58.880
And it's funny when I go to a place like LA and I'll walk into a building,

13:58.880 --> 14:01.840
I think, oh, man, I'm the fast person in here.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.200
And you can actually rate my physical attractiveness

14:05.840 --> 14:08.000
as I'm flying cross country.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.840
As I'm coming back to Huntington, West Virginia,

14:09.840 --> 14:12.720
I'm getting more and more attractive.

14:12.720 --> 14:18.240
As the plane capacity diminishes, I'm actually getting stubby.

14:18.240 --> 14:24.080
I think it's when they open the doors and there's a decompression.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.160
Because you've still got the LA air.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.640
Right, when the plane gets full of West Virginia air,

14:28.640 --> 14:32.080
it's like you go like three notches up the hotter not scale.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.480
Yeah, it's like when Superman, you know,

14:34.480 --> 14:36.000
the difference between the yellow sun and the red sun.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.880
That's right.

14:36.880 --> 14:37.520
That's right.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.640
Only the yellow sun, in this case, is a Jolly Pirate donut.

14:43.520 --> 14:46.080
You know, we lost one of the, we lost one of the,

14:46.080 --> 14:48.800
we're down to one Jolly Pirate donut.

14:48.800 --> 14:49.360
Oh, dang.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.480
Which one did we lose?

14:50.480 --> 14:54.080
We lost the one on First Street near Kroger and-

14:55.280 --> 14:56.400
That was the one I always went to.

14:56.400 --> 15:00.080
So wait, so we only have the one on Route 60?

15:00.080 --> 15:01.760
Yeah, so we only have the one on Route 60,

15:01.760 --> 15:06.000
which perplexingly sells donuts and heroes.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.480
Not heroes, heroes.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.800
I don't know why they've-

15:10.800 --> 15:13.520
Well, it's the Alex Andropoulos family that runs the joint.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.000
No, that would make sense.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.880
So this is just a cry for help to all of our listeners.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.280
If you drive through Huntington, West Virginia,

15:23.280 --> 15:25.520
please stop at the Route 60 Jolly Pirate donuts.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.640
Let's keep the hope alive.

15:26.640 --> 15:27.840
Just keep the lights on.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.240
The donuts are, the box that they come in

15:30.240 --> 15:31.520
looks like a treasure chest.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.760
Right, and that's the most exciting thing to see,

15:33.760 --> 15:35.520
like you wake up and it's Sunday morning,

15:35.520 --> 15:37.200
you're like, oh, church.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.960
And then you go downstairs and it's like,

15:38.960 --> 15:42.160
a fucking bounty, a royal bounty for you.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.440
Maybe a pirate brought it here.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.000
Nope, it's your dad.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.400
Trainers from the East Indies have brought

15:46.400 --> 15:48.480
a collection of the finest donuts.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.080
I love Travis's elephant hunter, old timey elephant hunter voice.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.760
What are some of the,

15:55.760 --> 15:58.880
what are some of the people volunteer there, Griffin?

16:00.240 --> 16:00.720
Some pretty-

16:00.720 --> 16:02.320
Hold on, wait, before you answer that,

16:02.320 --> 16:05.600
I do want to tell you everyone that gpale.com

16:05.600 --> 16:07.200
goes to iggypop.com.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.920
So I don't know if that's a nickname of his,

16:09.920 --> 16:11.520
but if not, it is now.

16:11.520 --> 16:15.280
Is it like spelled G-E-E-P-A-L-E?

16:15.280 --> 16:17.200
Like, gee, that dude is very pale,

16:17.200 --> 16:20.000
because that is a description true of Iggy Pop.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.920
Yeah, there's a lot of xenophobic shit up this Yahoo.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.840
Not on the internet.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.200
They look almost nothing at all

16:29.200 --> 16:31.600
like you see on television or in their films.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.240
Almost all white Americans have huge big eyes,

16:34.240 --> 16:35.760
flat wide noses, very wide mouths,

16:35.760 --> 16:37.760
square jaws, and are all teeth.

16:38.400 --> 16:38.900
What?

16:39.520 --> 16:42.880
Well, Americans' bodies are composed entirely of teeth.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.560
Most white American guys have their crew or buzz cut hair

16:48.560 --> 16:50.320
or the Martin Sheen haircut.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.000
What the fuck does that even mean?

16:52.000 --> 16:52.880
What is a Martin Sheen haircut?

16:52.880 --> 16:54.320
Give me a Martin Sheen.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.200
And wear clothes two to three size bigger

16:57.200 --> 16:59.440
to their body size with tennis shoes and white socks.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.760
Most white American women look like Cass Elliot

17:04.800 --> 17:08.080
or are very thin 70s Marcia Brady plain looking

17:08.080 --> 17:09.680
with long hair and Brooke Shields eyebrows.

17:10.240 --> 17:13.440
Man, this guy's painting a fucking picture.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.240
They all wear tight jeans, ski pants, or shorts

17:16.240 --> 17:18.720
with oversized t-shirts and flat shoes.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.640
Both genders always dress up only on Sundays

17:20.640 --> 17:22.400
in the 60s looking clothing.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.240
Is this an alien writing this?

17:25.840 --> 17:28.720
Is this our entry in the entire sky of the galaxy?

17:30.640 --> 17:31.760
That's messed up.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.120
Who wrote this?

17:33.120 --> 17:34.480
This is the most detailed answer.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.880
Some of them get like light tan skin,

17:36.880 --> 17:39.280
five nine chubby and just okay looking.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.560
Like, all right, that actually,

17:41.760 --> 17:42.960
that guy's kind of got a number.

17:42.960 --> 17:47.840
Are they outside my house and a asshole?

17:47.840 --> 17:49.920
I'm five eight, so nice try.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.800
Girls, tight jeans or sweat pants and a sweatshirt

17:52.800 --> 17:55.200
or a brand name t-shirt like Abercrombie,

17:55.200 --> 17:57.360
American Eagle, Hollister, or Arrow.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.680
Guys, oversized jeans and brand name t-shirt.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.200
That's what I see every day anyway.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.040
Brands.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.640
Brands all around.

18:04.640 --> 18:05.920
I'm a McDonald's.

18:05.920 --> 18:06.420
What?

18:07.360 --> 18:08.160
What does that mean?

18:08.800 --> 18:10.080
I like generic t-shirts.

18:10.080 --> 18:13.600
I only buy my t-shirts at Piggly Wiggly or Kroger.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.280
I actually own a Piggly Wiggly t-shirt

18:16.080 --> 18:17.440
and some Radio Shack pants.

18:18.640 --> 18:22.560
They got lots of pockets in which I store 19 batteries.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.040
You need a battery?

18:25.040 --> 18:25.760
Need a battery?

18:25.760 --> 18:26.240
What do you got?

18:26.240 --> 18:26.800
A Game Gear?

18:27.440 --> 18:28.800
I don't know if I got six double A's.

18:28.800 --> 18:29.600
Just kidding.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.880
Of course I do.

18:30.880 --> 18:31.840
I absolutely do.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.200
Let me get down in my Game Gear pocket.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.280
I want to help somebody else.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.840
I've recently been drafted by a group of friends

18:37.840 --> 18:40.160
into a fantasy football league which is a sport

18:40.160 --> 18:42.560
I have effectively zero interest in

18:42.560 --> 18:44.160
and an activity I don't understand

18:44.160 --> 18:45.760
and therefore fear deeply.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.360
Is there any way to take part in this league

18:47.360 --> 18:49.600
and not embarrass myself while at the same time

18:49.600 --> 18:51.600
avoiding actually learning anything about football

18:51.600 --> 18:52.160
in the process?

18:52.160 --> 18:53.520
That's from Sam from Lakewood.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.920
Why did you agree to do this?

18:55.920 --> 18:57.200
This fucking guy.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.200
How can I get better at this thing without trying?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.080
And also I didn't want to do it anyway

19:02.080 --> 19:03.280
but I'm doing it.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.960
Did you like literally get drafted?

19:04.960 --> 19:07.120
Like your number was up and it was like

19:07.120 --> 19:07.920
Sam you're in.

19:07.920 --> 19:08.240
What?

19:08.240 --> 19:08.640
No.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.440
No.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.560
Guys you gotta help me.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.800
I'm 1A in the football draft.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.800
What you gotta do is you gotta chop your finger off

19:15.520 --> 19:17.040
and that's the only way to get out of the draft.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.320
Yeah it's like I tried to hit the

19:18.320 --> 19:20.160
let me hit the space bar on my keyboard.

19:20.800 --> 19:21.440
No can do.

19:22.720 --> 19:23.280
Sorry guys.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.440
I mean I'm in a fancy football league

19:27.440 --> 19:28.640
and I don't know anything about football.

19:28.640 --> 19:29.520
It hadn't slowed me down.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.600
I mean it slowed me down from doing well in the league.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.080
Yeah I mean I'm pretty sure I came in dead last place

19:34.080 --> 19:36.560
because I kept forgetting to set my team for the week

19:36.560 --> 19:39.200
but that's not because I don't give a shit.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.160
It's just I'm very busy.

19:43.360 --> 19:46.480
I think the most the nice thing is like

19:46.480 --> 19:48.240
depending on what service you're using

19:48.240 --> 19:50.080
most of them say like

19:50.080 --> 19:51.600
Who is the best one?

19:51.600 --> 19:52.640
Who's the best one.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.360
You can usually just ask your computer aloud

19:55.360 --> 19:59.360
who is the best one and you can do a lot that way.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.240
There's also like when you're doing the actual draft

20:02.240 --> 20:05.600
you can get a top 200 rankings

20:05.600 --> 20:10.000
and once you've just sort of gone down that list

20:10.880 --> 20:12.960
once you've extended past that list

20:12.960 --> 20:14.080
at that point it's just guessing.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.520
It's just it is just

20:15.520 --> 20:18.160
who's gonna be who's gonna be good this year?

20:18.160 --> 20:20.080
Can you get to the fucking ball fields

20:20.080 --> 20:21.520
and like check these dudes out?

20:22.080 --> 20:24.000
I'm here I figured out the solution.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.200
One word three syllables.

20:27.200 --> 20:27.760
Okay.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.320
Moneyball.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.080
You're talking about saver metrics now.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.600
Okay I like this.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.760
You need to watch the movie Moneyball.

20:35.760 --> 20:36.960
Okay you haven't seen it

20:36.960 --> 20:39.520
so we can't make this advice any more applicable.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.120
And then you need to hire Jonah Hill.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.040
I watched.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.080
Run your team for you.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.600
The problem is I watched Moneyball

20:45.600 --> 20:46.800
and the math of Moneyball

20:46.800 --> 20:48.880
is all based on fucking points on the board

20:48.880 --> 20:50.960
and like that works for Moneyball

20:50.960 --> 20:52.320
but for fantasy football

20:52.320 --> 20:54.320
it's like you don't want a nose tackle

20:54.320 --> 20:56.880
that is going to get a lot of touchdown scores

20:57.520 --> 20:58.800
because it's the points.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.000
He's gonna put the points up.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.320
He is but I think it's actually negative.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.000
I think it's negative.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.360
There's still some life left in him.

21:05.360 --> 21:08.240
It's negative points if your if your defense

21:08.240 --> 21:11.040
gets uppity and decides to start scoring touchdowns.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.840
It's like guys you have a very specific job.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.280
We don't need you showboating

21:16.080 --> 21:19.040
and and taking it to the taking it to the red zone.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.280
But you could do you all see that in sports movies though

21:21.280 --> 21:22.640
where it's like we need a kicker

21:22.640 --> 21:24.480
and then they like bring in the dude who's like

21:25.120 --> 21:27.920
you know he's he's just been the worst tackle all his life

21:27.920 --> 21:29.920
and then he turns out to be an amazing kicker.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.720
Sure why don't you in your fantasy football draft

21:32.720 --> 21:34.160
maybe draft some people in

21:34.960 --> 21:37.760
that aren't in the positions that's fun.

21:37.760 --> 21:41.200
So for your lead quarterback for your lead quarterback

21:41.200 --> 21:45.440
you went ahead and you picked the coach of the team

21:45.440 --> 21:46.480
which is interesting.

21:46.480 --> 21:49.840
I don't know how you hacked the website in order to do that.

21:49.840 --> 21:53.120
Your offensive line is the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders

21:53.120 --> 21:55.440
which is in or that's an interesting strategy.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.480
Moneyball money.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.560
You did money ball though so I guess I got any points

22:00.560 --> 22:03.680
for points or do zero of them specific Randy Moss.

22:04.720 --> 22:08.160
All right that's your insider Justin with a hot tip.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.160
You got to get to the you got to get to the pitch

22:10.800 --> 22:12.480
and you got to scope these dudes out.

22:12.480 --> 22:14.640
You got to here's here's an important lesson I learned

22:14.640 --> 22:18.880
when nearly all of my players were injured simultaneously

22:18.880 --> 22:21.520
is you got to scope out these dudes injurability

22:21.520 --> 22:23.520
because if you can make it to the end without anybody

22:23.520 --> 22:26.960
fucking dying or murdering somebody

22:26.960 --> 22:28.800
then you have picked a damn good team.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.280
Look at their bones ask about their bones.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.640
How do your bones feel Jermichael?

22:34.000 --> 22:35.680
Jermichael can I inquire about your bones?

22:35.680 --> 22:37.600
Mr. Friendly tell me about your bones.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.080
Specifically your leg bones because man I need those good.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.600
Your holding bones would be ideal.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.520
If your ball holding bones.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.760
Which arm do you use to just sort of tuck that ball in?

22:51.760 --> 22:52.480
Your right one?

22:52.480 --> 22:53.680
Let me check out that right tip.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.000
Looking pretty good Jermichael.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.120
Drink this milk.

22:57.120 --> 22:57.840
Special milk.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.880
It's got ball bearings in it.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.400
It's going to lubricate you.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.080
You got to get out of this league Sam.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.680
Sam you got to get out of this league.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.440
No matter how hard you work at this

23:11.440 --> 23:14.240
you're going to come up against a wall of disinterest from you.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.280
I'm yourself.

23:15.280 --> 23:16.320
Here's how you get out of it.

23:16.320 --> 23:20.080
First meeting right show up to the draft wearing a wizard's robe

23:20.080 --> 23:23.440
and carrying a sword and say I'm ready for the fantasy.

23:23.440 --> 23:25.840
Right and then they're going to ask you to leave.

23:25.840 --> 23:26.560
Yeah.

23:26.560 --> 23:29.120
Say you were prepared by your fantasy seamstress

23:29.120 --> 23:31.280
and now you're ready to fucking rock it to Russia.

23:32.400 --> 23:37.440
You could also try to make it seem like you know too much about football

23:38.640 --> 23:39.520
to be in the league.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.640
Here's how I'd recommend doing that.

23:42.640 --> 23:49.280
Go in and ask your buddy so do you draft an entire team defense

23:50.000 --> 23:53.120
or do you draft individual defensive players?

23:53.120 --> 23:57.120
And then when they answer that then you tell them that you've done that before

23:57.120 --> 23:59.280
and it's beneath you.

23:59.280 --> 24:00.480
You can't do that again.

24:00.480 --> 24:00.880
Right.

24:00.880 --> 24:04.480
And then it'll make it seem like you love football and you love drafts.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.960
You just don't love this football.

24:06.960 --> 24:12.240
And then when you draft the worst team ever drafted in fantasy football history

24:12.240 --> 24:14.960
that illusion will be so mysterious to them

24:14.960 --> 24:17.040
because they'll be like damn I thought Jeff knew shit.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.680
I thought Jeff knew the shit about this.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.480
But you could play that out like with every pick you make.

24:22.480 --> 24:26.720
If it's really bad just act like you're way more plugged in.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.480
You wrote down Chris Sabo.

24:28.480 --> 24:29.280
What the fuck are you-

24:29.280 --> 24:30.720
Shh shh shh shh.

24:30.720 --> 24:31.920
Got some insider tips.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.280
Just put your finger beside your nose and wink.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.720
I checked out Sabo's bones.

24:35.840 --> 24:39.040
That dude's collar bones are fucking tight.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.360
I checked out his Sabo's-

24:41.360 --> 24:44.320
His eyeballs.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.280
His eyeballs, I won't lie, leave a lot to be desired.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.400
Not a lot of glasses allowed on the pitch.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.040
But this guy's collar bones? Disgusting.

24:53.040 --> 24:53.760
He's ripped.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.000
You could-

24:56.000 --> 24:59.040
You could great Gruyere on this guy's collar bones.

24:59.040 --> 24:59.840
They're amazing.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.680
His Sabo's are indestructible.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.120
I miss Chris Sabo's.

25:05.120 --> 25:05.920
Me too.

25:05.920 --> 25:06.560
Love that cat.

25:10.240 --> 25:10.960
Here's a quickie.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.240
When you're staying at a friend's house are you allowed to use their shower stuff?

25:14.240 --> 25:17.840
That's from Sneaky Shower Sampler.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.200
My answer is 100% yes.

25:19.200 --> 25:19.760
Yeah, definitely.

25:20.320 --> 25:22.160
They should have put that stuff in our lock and key.

25:23.760 --> 25:25.680
You walk into a friend's hotel and they've-

25:25.680 --> 25:28.960
Oh, they've set out some nice little sampler sized shampoos here.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.800
Sometimes I'll try both the soaps in there.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.560
You need to keep your scalp-

25:32.560 --> 25:33.520
Showing my armpits.

25:33.520 --> 25:37.520
You gotta keep your scalp away from them though.

25:38.160 --> 25:38.800
You gotta keep-

25:38.800 --> 25:39.360
You gotta make-

25:39.360 --> 25:44.960
Because it's an assumed thing, but it can lead to some sticky situations.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.240
His wife turns the corner into the kitchen and gets that whiff,

25:48.240 --> 25:50.960
that familiar Old Spice whiff and is like,

25:50.960 --> 25:51.680
hey honey, I'm-

25:52.240 --> 25:52.960
But it's you.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.360
She just called you honey.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.280
Now there's some tension in the mix.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.400
And then they're divorced.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.040
And then they're divorced.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.520
See, I have a quandary about this though, right?

26:03.520 --> 26:04.960
Does this apply to bar soap?

26:05.600 --> 26:07.040
Okay, the initial reaction is like,

26:07.040 --> 26:12.480
okay, I don't want to rub somebody else's skin on my skin.

26:12.480 --> 26:16.640
Well, skin is a best case scenario when you're talking-

26:16.640 --> 26:17.200
Their butt dirt, okay?

26:17.200 --> 26:18.400
Their butt dirt.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.840
Their crease.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.880
But here's the thing, we're talking about an object

26:22.880 --> 26:29.120
that is specifically designed to eliminate the danger of butt dirt.

26:29.120 --> 26:33.200
It's not like a magic thing that banishes the dirt.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.040
And we also need to address, Justin,

26:35.040 --> 26:39.200
are you just taking that bar of soap and just like,

26:40.080 --> 26:42.800
are you directly getting that bar of soap in your butt?

26:42.800 --> 26:46.480
Because we fucking stayed in the same fucking hotel room

26:46.480 --> 26:48.880
in Los Angeles like a week ago.

26:49.840 --> 26:54.320
Because I want to get all my butt dirt out

26:54.320 --> 26:55.200
and be daddy's clean boy.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.400
I'm suddenly the pervert here?

26:56.400 --> 26:57.200
You're not daddy's-

26:57.200 --> 26:58.240
It doesn't make any sense.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.400
Okay, first of all, I'm pissed off because that first day

27:00.400 --> 27:02.480
you're like, oh yeah, I guess I'll take the first shower.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.280
No big, little did I know you were fucking claiming

27:05.280 --> 27:09.120
that bar of soap so that nobody could ever use it again,

27:09.120 --> 27:10.960
even though I did, because I didn't know you were fucking,

27:11.840 --> 27:14.080
a fucking butt soap enthusiast.

27:14.080 --> 27:15.920
Yeah, please be more specific, Griffin,

27:15.920 --> 27:19.040
about the parts of my anatomy on which you are comfortable

27:20.000 --> 27:22.720
being a secondhand rough-

27:22.720 --> 27:25.440
If it doesn't touch me in a hug, I'm not interested in it.

27:26.880 --> 27:30.800
So you thought that I was washing and showering

27:30.800 --> 27:32.560
and doing my regular shower business,

27:32.560 --> 27:35.120
but leaving my crevices unmolested.

27:35.120 --> 27:40.320
Like maybe using a washcloth like a fucking sane adult.

27:40.320 --> 27:44.160
Hey, fucking Clouseau, did you see a washcloth in the shower?

27:44.160 --> 27:47.280
There were two literally on the shelf right next to it.

27:48.640 --> 27:49.440
Were they used?

27:50.560 --> 27:52.640
No, but I thought maybe there were four and you used two.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.240
I thought there were four and you used two.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.240
You thought I was just doing semaphore.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.520
There, in the shower.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.200
Please send liquid soap, help.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.720
I don't want my grimy butt dirt to be passed on

28:06.720 --> 28:09.360
to the next generation of McElroy.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.360
Oh, that bar of soap, they didn't change it too,

28:11.360 --> 28:13.360
because it was the worst hotel ever.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.640
I really want to stop talking about

28:14.640 --> 28:16.000
your guys' butt dirt exchange.

28:16.800 --> 28:17.760
That makes one of us.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.360
Let's talk about farm wisdom.

28:19.920 --> 28:20.880
Farm wisdom.

28:21.520 --> 28:22.720
Get a piece of straw.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.080
Here's he-ha farm wisdom.

28:24.640 --> 28:25.280
That was pretty good.

28:25.280 --> 28:30.160
Um, Sam sent us a really lovely picture of a real live baby cow

28:30.160 --> 28:33.040
that he had, that he was with in the picture,

28:33.040 --> 28:34.640
because he was holding a piece of paper

28:34.640 --> 28:37.680
saying NVMB AM, June 2013.

28:37.680 --> 28:38.720
You sure wasn't a chop?

28:38.720 --> 28:41.600
So, it looked pretty real.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.440
I'll post it, I'll post it on Twitter

28:43.440 --> 28:45.040
and everybody can take a peek.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.520
I photoshop myself into a lot of pictures with cows

28:47.520 --> 28:48.160
just to brag.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.000
That's fair.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.120
Show off.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.360
This bit of farm wisdom comes from Elizabeth

28:53.360 --> 28:56.800
and she says, raccoons perceived as mere pests

28:56.800 --> 28:58.960
and trash diggers in urban environments

28:58.960 --> 29:01.680
are stone cold assassins who will murderize your ducks

29:01.680 --> 29:02.640
under the cover of night.

29:02.640 --> 29:02.960
Sure.

29:02.960 --> 29:05.840
Their paw prints look exactly like baby hand prints

29:05.840 --> 29:08.240
and supposedly early settlers believed

29:08.240 --> 29:09.920
there were tiny babies walking around

29:09.920 --> 29:11.200
on their hands in the woods.

29:11.200 --> 29:14.880
How the fuck did we win this country?

29:14.880 --> 29:17.040
How the fuck were we the conquerors

29:17.040 --> 29:19.680
when we thought fucking baby, we had baby duck thieves?

29:20.400 --> 29:22.640
Oh, those are those forest babies.

29:22.640 --> 29:23.760
The babies of the woods.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.800
And this next one comes from Fred

29:26.800 --> 29:28.800
and Fred says his girlfriend's mom

29:29.760 --> 29:31.920
dropped a nugget of farm wisdom on him.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.240
If you see a turtle crossing the road,

29:34.240 --> 29:35.600
it's going to rain.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.360
The more turtles you see in the day,

29:37.360 --> 29:38.240
the worse it rains.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.240
That seems like dog shit to me.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.720
No, I don't want to confuse old wives tales

29:42.720 --> 29:44.160
of farm wisdom, right?

29:44.160 --> 29:46.720
No, I actually looked it up.

29:46.720 --> 29:50.000
I checked it out because I wanted to confirm this

29:50.000 --> 29:51.120
and that really is the thing.

29:51.120 --> 29:54.400
It has to do with like them moving to find water and such

29:54.400 --> 29:56.000
that apparently the more turtles you see,

29:56.000 --> 29:57.360
the bigger it's going to rain

29:57.360 --> 29:58.560
because they're anticipating it.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.160
How did the turtles-

30:00.160 --> 30:01.440
How did the fucking turtles-

30:01.440 --> 30:03.840
Are the turtles moving out of where it's not going to rain

30:03.840 --> 30:05.120
towards where the rain's going to happen?

30:05.680 --> 30:07.440
No, now you're getting beyond why not.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.440
Because if so, like that would be a pretty dope scene

30:09.440 --> 30:11.840
in Twister if they're like,

30:11.840 --> 30:14.320
we got to chase down this fucking deadly F5 funnel cloud,

30:14.320 --> 30:15.600
how are we going to pull this off?

30:15.600 --> 30:18.320
And then Helen Hunt?

30:18.320 --> 30:20.560
Helen Hunt?

30:22.880 --> 30:23.600
I'm not sure.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.360
Helen Hunt or Laura Dern?

30:25.360 --> 30:25.920
Helen Hunt?

30:26.560 --> 30:27.760
It's definitely Helen.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.400
Helen Hunt.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.000
Twister 2 is Laura Dern.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.320
Helen Hunt then in Twister 1.

30:32.320 --> 30:34.640
I guess the scene would work in either film.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.000
Gets out a box of turtles

30:39.040 --> 30:41.440
and then the fucking turtles get sucked up into the cloud,

30:41.440 --> 30:43.600
but the turtles have sensors attached to their backs.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.440
And so Bill Pullman?

30:46.640 --> 30:47.360
Bill Paxton.

30:47.360 --> 30:50.160
Bill Paxton achieves his live stream.

30:50.800 --> 30:51.600
Bill Polkston?

30:51.600 --> 30:53.920
I'm going to edit all that together

30:53.920 --> 30:55.920
and it's going to sound like I'm not having a stroke.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.880
Well, we got to pay for Griffin's stroke bill some way.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.320
So let's go to the Money Zone.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.280
Can we go to the Money Ball?

31:13.600 --> 31:16.320
So basically our only sponsor for the Money Zone this week.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.400
And if you, by the way, would like to be a sponsor,

31:18.960 --> 31:21.920
go to MaximumFun.org forward slash Jumbotron

31:21.920 --> 31:25.200
and you can wish someone happy birthday, happy anniversary,

31:25.760 --> 31:27.520
put out a personal or commercial message,

31:27.520 --> 31:28.800
anything you want, head over there.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.720
Our one sponsor though we're very happy to have

31:32.720 --> 31:38.000
is an adult Wonderland, really.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.840
I would call them a super-duper store.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.880
A super-duper store called ExtremeRestraints.com.

31:42.880 --> 31:46.800
They are also merchants of fantasy.

31:48.400 --> 31:48.960
That's true.

31:49.520 --> 31:50.000
That's true.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.040
You want to talk about somebody

31:51.040 --> 31:54.400
who maybe has a hard time explaining their job?

31:54.400 --> 31:56.560
How about the guy that has to pack up

31:56.560 --> 31:58.480
the Clitoris Enhancer Clip Pump Kit

31:59.280 --> 32:02.560
for shipping to you at a really great discount?

32:02.560 --> 32:03.040
I can-

32:04.240 --> 32:05.680
Even the import-export business.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.320
You keep listing off different jobs

32:08.320 --> 32:10.480
and I'll tell you what they actually tell their friends and family.

32:10.480 --> 32:13.520
Okay, dildo mold cleaner.

32:14.080 --> 32:14.480
They clean out-

32:14.480 --> 32:15.360
Sculptor.

32:15.360 --> 32:16.000
Sculptors.

32:16.000 --> 32:16.640
Yeah, that works.

32:18.080 --> 32:21.600
The guy who writes slut onto the impressions paddles.

32:21.600 --> 32:22.240
Calligrapher.

32:24.880 --> 32:27.120
Okay, so you're saying that someone's gonna tell me

32:27.120 --> 32:28.880
that they're a professional calligrapher

32:28.880 --> 32:30.400
and I'm gonna let that convo drop?

32:32.240 --> 32:32.640
Oh, okay.

32:32.640 --> 32:33.520
What do you calligraphize?

32:33.520 --> 32:34.960
Like wedding invitations?

32:34.960 --> 32:37.680
In a manner of speaking, in a manner of speaking,

32:37.680 --> 32:40.320
it is inviting to some-

32:40.320 --> 32:40.720
Travis.

32:40.720 --> 32:41.840
To some individuals.

32:42.480 --> 32:44.160
What about the guy who individually tests

32:44.160 --> 32:46.160
each Rump Shaker vibrating anal plug?

32:47.200 --> 32:48.240
That would be R&D.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.720
I'm in R&D?

32:50.720 --> 32:52.160
Yeah, research and development.

32:52.160 --> 32:52.640
Thank you.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.560
Who, what about the guy that picks the model

32:57.040 --> 32:59.440
that displays the spider mouth gags?

32:59.440 --> 33:00.480
A talent scout.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.800
Okay, you're pretty good at this.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.280
I'll give it, but if you would like to see

33:05.280 --> 33:08.400
all these different career opportunities,

33:08.400 --> 33:09.920
they're all at ExtremeRestraints.com.

33:09.920 --> 33:12.320
What about the person that tries masturbating

33:12.320 --> 33:15.280
to all the pictures before they can put it up on the web?

33:15.280 --> 33:16.960
Because before they put up a picture on their website,

33:16.960 --> 33:19.760
somebody has to successfully masturbate to that picture.

33:20.320 --> 33:21.040
Focus group.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.080
Damn.

33:22.800 --> 33:23.600
Damn, you're good.

33:23.600 --> 33:26.080
I don't think you can be a professional focus group member,

33:26.080 --> 33:27.280
though, that's not a very-

33:27.280 --> 33:28.800
I'm a focus group of one.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.160
I get paid in Teddy Grahams.

33:30.160 --> 33:33.440
You can get everything on this website for 20% off.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.480
All you need to do is use a coupon code from us,

33:36.480 --> 33:39.840
and it's Sexabunga, which is spelled just like it sounds.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.800
But I would not recommend saying it out loud.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.880
Or, yeah, because the fucking prism.

33:44.880 --> 33:46.000
Prism could be listening,

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
and then they'll fucking leak it to a coupon site.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.160
We can't have that, guys.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.160
You got to keep this coupon code secret,

33:52.160 --> 33:55.680
but don't keep it so secret that you forget to use it,

33:55.680 --> 33:58.080
and pick yourself up an offer.

33:58.080 --> 34:01.040
And pick yourself up an ostrich tickler.

34:01.600 --> 34:02.160
I don't have-

34:02.160 --> 34:04.000
That was actually the job that I tell people I do.

34:08.240 --> 34:10.880
Hi, I'm Jesse Thorne, the host of NPR's Bullseye.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.880
And I'm Jordan Morris, another guy.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.520
Jordan and I have been friends for a really long time,

34:15.520 --> 34:17.280
and we co-host the comedy podcast,

34:17.280 --> 34:18.960
Jordan and Jesse Go Together.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.680
Jordan, what would you say Jordan and Jesse goes all about?

34:21.680 --> 34:26.880
Well, it's about funny stories, crazy ideas, swearing.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.160
So basically nothing.

34:28.160 --> 34:29.040
Yeah, nothing.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.360
But we always have fun and funny celebrity guests

34:31.360 --> 34:34.240
from the worlds of comedy, television, music, everything.

34:34.240 --> 34:37.520
I think you're actually gonna like being radio friends with us.

34:37.520 --> 34:38.000
Yeah.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.040
Check out Jordan and Jesse Go online at MaximumFun.org,

34:41.040 --> 34:43.600
or free in iTunes or your favorite podcatcher.

34:45.440 --> 34:46.240
Do you guys know Yahoo?

34:46.880 --> 34:47.760
Absolutely.

34:47.760 --> 34:49.920
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.360
Are you Ira Ray?

34:53.360 --> 34:54.560
What happened to you?

34:54.560 --> 34:57.600
I'm sorry, I was waiting for the question,

34:57.600 --> 34:59.200
and I wanted to say something funny about it,

34:59.200 --> 35:00.800
and I'm sorry.

35:00.800 --> 35:01.520
You choked.

35:01.520 --> 35:02.800
You don't even know what the question is yet?

35:02.800 --> 35:03.520
How are you gonna-

35:03.520 --> 35:04.000
Idiot.

35:04.000 --> 35:04.400
Okay.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.400
I was just opening my mind and getting ready.

35:06.400 --> 35:06.900
Okay.

35:07.760 --> 35:08.640
Who wants to know?

35:08.640 --> 35:12.080
It's by Yahoo Answers user Nigel, who asks,

35:12.080 --> 35:14.400
is it fun to butt chug Diet Pepsi Max?

35:16.160 --> 35:19.280
I was wondering if doing it gets you buzzed faster than normal.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.680
Yeah, what's irritating is I've been having a hard time

35:23.680 --> 35:25.120
finding Pepsi Max lately,

35:25.120 --> 35:27.360
and I guess this is where it's often going.

35:27.360 --> 35:31.600
Because you'd have to do this a lot to get buzzed off it.

35:32.480 --> 35:36.240
When he says buzzed, does he mean like a caffeine booze?

35:36.240 --> 35:39.120
Well, the Max has some, what, like some Guarana,

35:39.120 --> 35:40.800
some justice shit up in, right?

35:41.680 --> 35:42.240
Yeah.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.760
What is butt chugging?

35:43.760 --> 35:48.640
Butt chugging is, it's when, you know how like you get thirsty

35:49.280 --> 35:50.880
in your mouth and your throat,

35:50.880 --> 35:53.680
and the way you remedy that is to pour liquid down it

35:53.680 --> 35:55.600
and just like send it down the right pipe?

35:57.040 --> 35:58.240
This is the wrong pipe.

35:58.240 --> 36:02.880
This is the wrongest pipe for this particular activity,

36:02.880 --> 36:04.480
but there are certain individuals,

36:04.480 --> 36:09.440
it's like a genetic flaw that like your mouth and throat gets thirsty,

36:09.440 --> 36:12.960
your butt gets like super, it's called dry butt.

36:14.720 --> 36:16.000
Okay, I've never heard that.

36:16.000 --> 36:16.880
Well, it's because we don't-

36:16.880 --> 36:18.320
That's because you wash your butts.

36:18.320 --> 36:21.120
And in the McElroy kitchen, Punnett Square,

36:21.760 --> 36:25.440
dry butt doesn't appear anywhere in the mix.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.600
It's not a recessive or a dominant trait,

36:27.600 --> 36:29.760
so we didn't even run the risk of having it,

36:29.760 --> 36:30.560
but there are a lot-

36:30.560 --> 36:31.680
We have the wettest butts.

36:32.560 --> 36:36.160
I wouldn't say we have wet butts out loud on a podcast, Travis,

36:36.160 --> 36:38.480
but I would say that they are-

36:38.480 --> 36:39.520
Moist butts?

36:39.520 --> 36:40.800
They are of average-

36:42.160 --> 36:42.800
Moisture.

36:42.800 --> 36:43.840
Moisture, yes.

36:45.280 --> 36:45.520
Okay.

36:45.520 --> 36:50.560
Okay, so this is like a, also teenagers do it to get fucked up

36:50.560 --> 36:51.280
because they're dumb.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.400
Why don't they just put it in their regular holes?

36:54.400 --> 36:57.680
Because when you put it in your butt, it absorbs more efficiently.

36:57.680 --> 36:57.920
Yeah.

36:57.920 --> 36:58.880
Does it though?

36:58.880 --> 36:59.600
Yeah.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.520
They've gotta be, I don't believe,

37:01.520 --> 37:05.840
I think that kids are the dumbest things that exist.

37:05.840 --> 37:09.520
Kids between the ages of 10 and 19.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.720
I'm sorry if you are listening and you fall into that category.

37:12.720 --> 37:14.240
I don't, I think they're the dumbest,

37:14.240 --> 37:17.680
but I don't think that they would butt chug or colon roll

37:18.640 --> 37:20.240
if it didn't get results.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.120
But somebody had to do it the first time.

37:23.840 --> 37:26.480
Like there had to be a pioneer who was like,

37:26.480 --> 37:27.600
I've got it, you guys.

37:27.600 --> 37:28.960
A 13 year old was doing it

37:28.960 --> 37:31.360
because they were trying to early pledge for a frat

37:31.360 --> 37:34.320
because the world is fucked and we're all dead.

37:35.760 --> 37:38.240
Children are our future and our future is looking pretty shitty,

37:38.240 --> 37:38.880
if you ask me.

37:38.880 --> 37:44.800
There's a problem that I have with butt chugging.

37:44.800 --> 37:45.680
At just the one?

37:48.240 --> 37:49.360
That you do it.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.520
That's the issue, that it exists.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.440
Is it, I mean, what about the taste?

37:58.400 --> 38:00.400
Don't you miss the taste of alcohol?

38:00.400 --> 38:02.480
Well, you catch some of that with your taste buds.

38:03.600 --> 38:04.800
I don't think that is accurate.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.440
I think you're starting to lie to me about butt chugging now.

38:07.440 --> 38:10.240
Well, no, cause like when you eat food,

38:10.240 --> 38:11.840
some of your taste buds come off with the food

38:11.840 --> 38:13.360
and they go down in the bolus.

38:14.160 --> 38:18.880
Can I tell you guys something that is so sad to me

38:18.880 --> 38:21.920
is that we have been doing this show for this long

38:21.920 --> 38:28.480
and we have gone to so many depraved corridors of humanity

38:28.480 --> 38:32.320
that when I'm introduced to the concept

38:33.120 --> 38:36.480
and the opportunity to discuss this idea of butt chugging,

38:36.480 --> 38:38.720
it is not even remarkable enough to me

38:38.720 --> 38:40.880
on the landscape of human depravity

38:41.440 --> 38:47.840
that I can come up with anything too useful to say about it.

38:47.840 --> 38:50.480
Yeah, I mean, I guess people do everything.

38:50.480 --> 38:53.440
We're talking about literal teenagers

38:53.440 --> 38:56.400
literally pouring liquids up their body

38:56.400 --> 38:57.840
and I'm just kind of sleepy.

38:58.560 --> 38:59.440
That's like where I'm at.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.520
I was just thinking about how great it would be

39:01.520 --> 39:02.560
to take a nap right now.

39:03.120 --> 39:04.960
Do you think that's what getting old is

39:04.960 --> 39:06.000
when people are like, why?

39:06.000 --> 39:07.440
I mean, it takes all kinds.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.880
Like they say stuff like that

39:08.880 --> 39:12.160
because they've seen how bad it gets everywhere

39:12.160 --> 39:14.880
with everything that they can't find it

39:14.880 --> 39:15.760
in their hearts to be moved.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.920
Well, yeah, because like, and that's also what death is.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.280
Death is like you see the last thing

39:19.280 --> 39:21.360
and you're like, oh, vagina chewing.

39:21.360 --> 39:21.760
I'm out.

39:24.480 --> 39:24.960
I'm out.

39:24.960 --> 39:27.360
I peaked at vagina eating and now I'm done.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.560
Are we accelerating our own,

39:30.560 --> 39:34.240
like are our deaths gonna approach us quicker

39:34.240 --> 39:37.440
because we've seen and or secondhand experience

39:37.440 --> 39:38.800
like more of the things?

39:38.800 --> 39:42.800
I know because like in the giver,

39:42.800 --> 39:45.520
we need to have children that we pass along.

39:45.520 --> 39:48.000
I don't wanna give any experiences to

39:48.000 --> 39:48.640
and then we can die.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.920
I would rather inject these kids

39:49.920 --> 39:50.880
and put them down the chute

39:50.880 --> 39:52.240
to continue the giver analogy.

39:52.960 --> 39:53.760
No fucking way.

39:55.040 --> 39:55.840
No fucking way.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.840
My kids can never know about this program.

39:59.280 --> 40:02.160
I am fucking burying everybody's computers in a vault.

40:02.160 --> 40:06.720
Seriously, and yes, Justin, I feel like we are moving,

40:06.720 --> 40:09.520
like we are definitely moving ourselves faster

40:09.520 --> 40:11.280
to the grave with this podcast

40:11.280 --> 40:13.520
because I was shooting for 250 when we started

40:13.520 --> 40:16.160
and now I feel like I'm on death's door

40:16.160 --> 40:17.360
before we even get to 200.

40:17.360 --> 40:22.320
Wait, you're saying that you wanted to live to 250 years old.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.320
250 episodes, not years

40:24.320 --> 40:26.320
because fucking teenagers won't let me get that long.

40:26.320 --> 40:27.040
They're trying to kill me.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.880
I feel like once we do 200 episodes,

40:28.880 --> 40:29.680
that'll be enough.

40:29.680 --> 40:30.080
Yeah.

40:30.080 --> 40:32.080
I mean, like, I feel like we'll have enough of a catalog.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.400
There won't be any more shit that teenagers do

40:34.960 --> 40:36.560
that we haven't talked about.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.960
We'll have to start answering adult questions.

40:38.960 --> 40:42.000
Yeah, children are quite literally our future on this show

40:42.000 --> 40:44.720
and the future is running out.

40:44.720 --> 40:45.680
We're running out of future.

40:45.680 --> 40:46.800
Or we're gonna have to like start going

40:46.800 --> 40:50.240
to fucking Spencer's gifts and doing some polling,

40:50.240 --> 40:52.160
doing some census work on the ground.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.000
Have you heard about anything dirty?

40:54.000 --> 40:55.520
Hey, what do kids do?

40:55.520 --> 40:56.240
Butt checking?

40:56.240 --> 40:56.960
Nah, we did that.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.320
Vagina chewing.

40:58.320 --> 40:58.960
Ding, ding, ding.

40:59.680 --> 41:00.880
Griffin joked about it once.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.640
We can't do that one anymore.

41:02.640 --> 41:04.880
We invented that actually accidentally.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.160
We invented vagina chewing.

41:08.160 --> 41:11.520
Kids, please start doing some really messed up things.

41:11.520 --> 41:12.880
Like really depraved.

41:12.880 --> 41:14.240
Yeah, keep us going.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.920
Just keep this show going.

41:15.920 --> 41:16.800
We're running it.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.200
But in no way are we endorsing the horrible things

41:19.200 --> 41:21.040
you're going to do to your own body.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.320
But do tell us about them.

41:22.320 --> 41:23.280
Do tell.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.480
If it's gonna happen to someone,

41:24.480 --> 41:26.000
you can even abstract the story

41:26.000 --> 41:27.280
so it happened to a buddy.

41:27.280 --> 41:27.920
A wink.

41:27.920 --> 41:28.720
Um, no, don't do it.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.000
We gotta legally cover ourselves here.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.040
Don't do these things.

41:31.600 --> 41:32.640
Don't do anything.

41:33.760 --> 41:36.400
But do, you know, feel free to listen to this next question.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.680
You've earned yourself that much.

41:38.480 --> 41:40.080
My wife and I recently found out

41:40.080 --> 41:41.360
we're gonna have a second child.

41:42.160 --> 41:44.560
For our first one, we got a name pretty quickly.

41:44.560 --> 41:46.000
And that's worked out pretty well.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.760
But we're stumped on this one.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.760
Any advice on finding that perfect name

41:49.760 --> 41:51.520
that's from Addled in Alabama?

41:51.520 --> 41:54.720
I like the idea of the first name

41:54.720 --> 41:56.560
it worked out pretty well.

41:56.560 --> 41:59.760
Like there's like a shit, like it's a fucking like fluid,

41:59.760 --> 42:01.520
like you name your kid Douglas

42:01.520 --> 42:04.080
and then like the world's most famous mass murderer

42:04.080 --> 42:05.120
is named Douglas.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.640
And then you're like, well, shit.

42:06.640 --> 42:07.280
Dammit.

42:07.280 --> 42:08.960
Do you think he'd check with the baby?

42:08.960 --> 42:11.040
Like, hey, baby, how's your name going?

42:11.040 --> 42:11.840
Are you with Douglas?

42:11.840 --> 42:14.240
I just wanna do a quick, let me dip in real quick, baby.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.680
Um, yeah?

42:15.680 --> 42:16.240
Thumbs up?

42:16.240 --> 42:18.560
Your baby, your baby, as soon as he learns to speak

42:18.560 --> 42:20.800
and put together like cogent thought is like,

42:20.800 --> 42:23.040
ah, man, that's a good name.

42:23.040 --> 42:26.400
Thought is like, ah, man, you should have gone with,

42:26.400 --> 42:28.000
the correct answer was Craig.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.600
I have been a Craig since day one.

42:31.600 --> 42:34.320
I just feel like I'm a Craig trapped in a Douglas body.

42:34.320 --> 42:34.880
Right.

42:34.880 --> 42:37.680
You should not name your children until,

42:37.680 --> 42:40.000
I think you should let them name themselves.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.960
Or let your first child name your second child.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.080
Oh, that's fun.

42:44.080 --> 42:47.920
Cause every child born onto the United States

42:47.920 --> 42:48.960
will be called Trucks.

42:48.960 --> 42:51.360
Trucks.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.800
This is my son, Cheerio.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.600
I think that's my first word.

42:55.600 --> 42:56.640
Cheerio, I think.

42:56.640 --> 42:57.120
Cheerios.

42:57.680 --> 42:58.320
Good job.

42:58.320 --> 43:00.640
Get those complex carbohydrates going.

43:00.640 --> 43:01.440
Introduce them early.

43:01.440 --> 43:04.480
Well, at least it wasn't like, uh oh, crunch berries.

43:04.480 --> 43:04.960
You know what I mean?

43:04.960 --> 43:08.400
Like they're far, they're far berries.

43:08.400 --> 43:08.880
Yeah.

43:08.880 --> 43:09.520
At least your first.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.360
This is my little brother, Piscetti.

43:11.360 --> 43:11.760
Get it?

43:13.520 --> 43:15.440
Cause I can't say it cause I'm two.

43:15.440 --> 43:18.560
Or if your kid is older, your first child is like eight

43:18.560 --> 43:21.040
and he just names them like, uh, the other one.

43:22.080 --> 43:23.520
Mommy's new favorite.

43:23.520 --> 43:23.680
Yeah.

43:24.720 --> 43:25.680
Oh, it got sad.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.600
What if you got like the right age for a kid?

43:27.600 --> 43:29.920
You could come up with a pretty banging name though.

43:29.920 --> 43:33.680
Like if you let your, say seven year old,

43:33.680 --> 43:37.360
name your baby Decepticon, like that could be pretty good.

43:37.360 --> 43:37.520
I think.

43:37.520 --> 43:39.200
Wait, is he naming the baby Decepticon

43:39.200 --> 43:41.120
or did you have a baby Decepticon?

43:41.120 --> 43:42.320
No, no, no, no.

43:42.320 --> 43:43.760
That technology is years away.

43:43.760 --> 43:48.080
I'm saying just that you let the child name the other baby

43:48.080 --> 43:50.880
based on whatever, you know, whatever he's into.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.560
What are you into right now, kid?

43:53.120 --> 43:54.560
Captain Feathersword, the baby.

43:54.560 --> 43:55.520
That sounds like a good name.

43:55.520 --> 43:56.960
Put it on the certificate.

43:56.960 --> 43:57.680
That's pretty good.

43:57.680 --> 44:01.680
Um, I don't want to talk about celebrity gossip on this show,

44:01.680 --> 44:04.720
but we're about to because I saw this news story.

44:05.360 --> 44:07.760
I saw this news article on the times.

44:09.040 --> 44:14.800
One of the times, um, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian

44:14.800 --> 44:17.760
named their baby North, making the babies named Northwest.

44:17.760 --> 44:20.000
And we can all agree that that's fresh.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.280
That's fresh as shit.

44:21.280 --> 44:25.920
Except they came out and they said it's not,

44:25.920 --> 44:28.400
the name is not like the cardinal direction.

44:29.040 --> 44:32.080
The name, they were saying like North is like up

44:32.080 --> 44:33.360
and that's where this baby's going.

44:34.240 --> 44:36.640
It's on a skyward trajectory, which.

44:36.640 --> 44:42.880
So I'm sorry, were they trying to make a case for the fact

44:42.880 --> 44:45.040
that both this child's names were cardinal directions

44:45.600 --> 44:46.800
were unrelated?

44:46.800 --> 44:48.400
Like they didn't realize till after?

44:48.400 --> 44:51.120
No, I think, I think that they are trying to make that argument.

44:51.120 --> 44:52.720
They're also trying to make the argument

44:53.600 --> 44:57.440
that when you look up in the sky, that direction is North.

44:58.800 --> 44:59.920
It's not dog.

45:01.120 --> 45:03.360
That's that direction is up upwards.

45:04.080 --> 45:06.080
You collaborated with God up.

45:07.680 --> 45:09.280
You collaborated with God once.

45:09.280 --> 45:11.920
I don't think he's going to change physics for you.

45:13.520 --> 45:14.080
Sorry guys.

45:14.080 --> 45:18.720
Yeah, yeah, I had to work part of the retainer on the album

45:18.720 --> 45:22.400
is North is up now and forwards is just Yeezus.

45:23.360 --> 45:27.120
I tell you what though, these compasses are fucked up.

45:27.120 --> 45:30.880
Are you guys coming to a Yeezus by Yeezus East this year?

45:30.880 --> 45:33.120
So I see some pretty good shows there.

45:33.920 --> 45:35.760
Surprisingly Yeezus is not performing.

45:36.480 --> 45:39.920
My, you know, a lot of people will give me shit for this.

45:39.920 --> 45:42.960
My favorite Rob Reiner movie is still Yeezus.

45:42.960 --> 45:45.280
That's why I know it's a little off the wall,

45:45.280 --> 45:50.000
but I really think that Elijah Wood is good in it.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.720
14 whole seconds to understand it.

45:55.760 --> 45:57.040
Do you guys want to know about Yahoo?

45:57.680 --> 45:59.040
Northwest is a good name.

45:59.040 --> 45:59.920
It is a good name.

45:59.920 --> 46:02.400
Just fucking just like own it.

46:02.400 --> 46:03.040
You know what I mean?

46:04.320 --> 46:04.960
Yeah.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.400
This Yahoo was sent in by Jacob Locker.

46:06.400 --> 46:07.200
Thank you Jacob Locker.

46:07.200 --> 46:09.440
It's by Yahoo answers user Cassie who asks,

46:09.440 --> 46:10.720
I want to bury stuff.

46:10.720 --> 46:13.360
What will protect it in the ground?

46:13.360 --> 46:15.200
I want to put stuff in a box and bury it.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.320
What will protect the box?

46:17.760 --> 46:19.600
A bigger box, larger box.

46:19.600 --> 46:20.080
Oh yeah.

46:20.080 --> 46:21.760
But then you think of like coffins and shit.

46:21.760 --> 46:23.520
Like I almost always am.

46:25.440 --> 46:28.720
And then like this worms and bugs and dirt and nutrients

46:28.720 --> 46:29.520
and shit get in there.

46:31.120 --> 46:32.320
You got to put another box.

46:33.840 --> 46:34.640
Well, wait a minute.

46:34.640 --> 46:35.840
You got to double box it.

46:35.840 --> 46:36.160
Right.

46:36.160 --> 46:40.080
But I think it depends on like what you're burying, right?

46:40.080 --> 46:41.600
Because if you're burying something

46:41.600 --> 46:44.400
that already has dirt in it, like a butt.

46:44.400 --> 46:45.200
How bad can it get?

46:46.400 --> 46:46.640
Yeah.

46:46.640 --> 46:48.720
It's just going to keep going down that path.

46:48.720 --> 46:50.800
There's really nothing you could do to prevent it.

46:50.800 --> 46:52.560
You're saying pre-ruin your shit.

46:53.600 --> 46:54.720
And then when you put it in the ground,

46:54.720 --> 46:55.920
like it's not going to get any worse.

46:55.920 --> 46:56.880
It's already shitty.

46:57.440 --> 46:58.640
That's a pretty dumb idea,

46:58.640 --> 47:03.440
but it's no worse than Travis's shitty Matryoshka doll idea

47:03.440 --> 47:05.440
of box upon box upon box upon box.

47:06.320 --> 47:06.880
Although that.

47:08.240 --> 47:08.800
I'm sorry.

47:08.800 --> 47:10.480
I thought that this,

47:10.480 --> 47:12.880
I thought this podcast was a free exchange of ideas.

47:14.560 --> 47:17.120
I was not aware that this was a hate factory.

47:18.320 --> 47:18.960
It wasn't.

47:18.960 --> 47:23.200
But then after we hired Paula Deen, she insisted.

47:23.200 --> 47:23.760
Hey, y'all.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.120
Hey, y'all.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.480
Welcome to the hate factory.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.640
The world's worst stand up comic club.

47:32.080 --> 47:33.760
You look slightly Italian.

47:35.120 --> 47:35.680
Can we not?

47:35.680 --> 47:36.640
Dinosaurs.

47:36.640 --> 47:41.680
Dinosaurs little kids are always burying their shit.

47:41.680 --> 47:42.080
Why not?

47:43.200 --> 47:44.240
Why not put it in?

47:44.240 --> 47:45.360
Why not put it in a tree?

47:45.360 --> 47:50.640
Why not do like a little kid sky burial where you cover it with,

47:50.640 --> 47:53.680
you know, with berries and other things that birds like,

47:53.680 --> 47:55.760
and then they'll just take your things in the sky.

47:55.760 --> 47:58.400
Are you even talking English now?

47:58.400 --> 48:01.280
There's you haven't heard of what it's a sky burial where like

48:02.000 --> 48:04.880
somebody dies and they let them get down to just bones.

48:04.880 --> 48:05.760
It's getting a little morbid,

48:05.760 --> 48:07.520
but they let the body just get down to just bones

48:07.520 --> 48:10.880
and they cover those bones in sweet sense.

48:11.600 --> 48:13.120
And then they put it on top of a mountain

48:13.120 --> 48:14.640
and birds just carry it in the sky.

48:14.640 --> 48:15.440
Sky burial.

48:15.440 --> 48:17.040
The birds carry the bones away.

48:17.040 --> 48:18.160
Birds carry away the bones.

48:18.160 --> 48:20.000
They don't remain in the sky.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.040
I imagine.

48:22.560 --> 48:26.400
I don't think that a plane is going to be flying like over the Alps somewhere

48:26.400 --> 48:28.160
and then run into a bone cloud.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.040
Because that would be pretty gnar.

48:31.600 --> 48:34.560
But I am saying for temporarily your bones are in flight.

48:34.560 --> 48:36.000
They're in transit.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.480
So it's not a sky burial so much as a various locations nearby burial.

48:40.480 --> 48:44.560
Well, it's a burial for as long as a bird can stay interested in carrying anything.

48:44.560 --> 48:45.040
It's a-

48:45.040 --> 48:47.040
Which newsflash is very short.

48:48.240 --> 48:49.680
I mean, it's a nest burial.

48:49.680 --> 48:50.560
Like, let's be honest.

48:50.560 --> 48:50.800
Yeah.

48:51.440 --> 48:52.480
But then you become in part,

48:52.480 --> 48:55.520
you're getting back into the fucking live stream.

48:55.520 --> 48:56.320
Back into the manna.

48:56.320 --> 48:57.520
I do like that though.

48:57.520 --> 49:00.400
I want my energy to help support a beautiful robin egg.

49:00.400 --> 49:01.120
That's what I'm saying.

49:01.120 --> 49:04.160
I would rather birds didn't shit all over my corpse though.

49:04.160 --> 49:06.160
Well, it's just your bones.

49:06.160 --> 49:08.720
And really, once you get down to bones, that's not you anymore.

49:08.720 --> 49:09.520
It's just bones.

49:10.240 --> 49:10.880
Yeah.

49:10.880 --> 49:13.600
I think Mary Roach wrote about that in Stiff,

49:13.600 --> 49:16.400
where she talked about just the natural cycle of life,

49:16.400 --> 49:18.160
where it ends with birds shitting all over you.

49:18.160 --> 49:21.280
Do you know who would make a great nest?

49:23.200 --> 49:26.240
Michael Finley is looking so good this season.

49:28.720 --> 49:30.720
Chris Sabones, put him in the sky.

49:30.720 --> 49:32.960
Put him in a nest, no matter where he is.

49:32.960 --> 49:35.440
Football, baseball, basketball, hyali.

49:36.160 --> 49:37.360
Dude's got the best bones.

49:38.480 --> 49:41.840
If I was a bird and I could make a nest out of Chris Sabones,

49:41.840 --> 49:47.040
I think it would be something I would pass down to the next generation of birds.

49:47.040 --> 49:52.480
There are vultures just like chilling outside of his Cincinnati compound.

49:52.480 --> 49:54.320
Just waiting for the day.

49:54.320 --> 49:54.960
I think we're done.

49:54.960 --> 49:55.460
Yeah.

49:57.120 --> 49:59.520
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

49:59.520 --> 50:00.640
my brother, my brother and me.

50:00.640 --> 50:06.400
Uh, note, programming note, uh, if I may be so bold,

50:06.400 --> 50:10.080
uh, we have a new addition to the Maximum Fun family,

50:10.080 --> 50:13.840
uh, and it's a show called Sawbones that's made by me and my wife, Sidney.

50:13.840 --> 50:14.560
Sounds shitty.

50:14.560 --> 50:15.060
Who's it?

50:15.600 --> 50:15.840
Yeah.

50:15.840 --> 50:16.800
No, it's good.

50:16.800 --> 50:18.240
It's made by me and my wife, Sidney.

50:18.240 --> 50:18.960
She's a doctor.

50:18.960 --> 50:21.600
And we talk about, um, the history of medicine,

50:21.600 --> 50:25.360
but it's, it's a silly show about the history of medicine because I'm dumb.

50:25.360 --> 50:28.160
Now, Justin, I've heard it's a 45 minute long fart.

50:28.160 --> 50:28.880
Is that true?

50:28.880 --> 50:30.480
No, it's, there's no farts.

50:30.480 --> 50:31.920
We haven't done that episode yet.

50:31.920 --> 50:33.280
Our first episode is about trepanation,

50:33.280 --> 50:37.680
which is a, uh, a medical procedure that involves putting a head hole in your head.

50:37.680 --> 50:39.200
Uh, you can find it on iTunes.

50:39.200 --> 50:42.720
If you could subscribe and like tell your friends and rate and review and everything,

50:42.720 --> 50:44.160
that would be supremely helpful.

50:44.160 --> 50:45.680
These opening weeks are so important.

50:45.680 --> 50:50.160
If you could, if you could fucking like not stop listening to our podcast

50:50.720 --> 50:54.400
when you like make a hole in your life for Justin and Sidney's new podcast,

50:54.400 --> 50:55.200
that's not this one.

50:55.200 --> 51:00.400
Like I would, I would have, I, as the only, this being the only podcast that I really do

51:00.400 --> 51:03.600
other than besties, which doesn't count.

51:03.600 --> 51:06.960
Um, I just, it's so important to me that you guys maintain.

51:08.240 --> 51:11.440
Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, my podcast is still dead.

51:13.680 --> 51:14.560
Oh man.

51:14.560 --> 51:16.320
I am working on a new podcast though.

51:16.320 --> 51:18.000
Why do you have to make this about you?

51:18.000 --> 51:20.160
Why can't this one moment be about me?

51:20.160 --> 51:20.660
Fuck.

51:20.660 --> 51:26.340
Oh, also, uh, John Hodgman has a special on Netflix called Ragnarok, uh, filmed in front

51:26.340 --> 51:29.380
of a live audience and it's absolutely hilarious.

51:29.380 --> 51:30.340
Make sure you check it out.

51:30.340 --> 51:31.060
