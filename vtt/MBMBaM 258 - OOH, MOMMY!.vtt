WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.000
Uh, we were talking about worldwide gay marriage, right?

00:49.200 --> 00:52.560
I don't know, because it's Friday now. It'll be Monday by the time this...

00:52.560 --> 00:56.000
That's all right. I'm excited now. Travis!

00:56.000 --> 01:00.240
What? The gay marriage is legal across

01:00.240 --> 01:02.560
the country. What are you doing?

01:04.160 --> 01:09.440
I've only been up for like 10 minutes. Have you been on Facebook or social media

01:09.440 --> 01:11.280
or anything? No.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.320
All right, this will be us breaking the news to Travis.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.520
Well, can we just use this? Yes.

01:17.520 --> 01:18.800
Yeah, okay. Okay.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.440
Welcome to my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

01:21.440 --> 01:24.640
I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

01:24.640 --> 01:27.440
I'm Griffin McElroy. Travis, I can't imagine what a pleasant

01:27.440 --> 01:32.720
surprise is. TGIF, gay marriage, is now mandatory worldwide.

01:32.720 --> 01:34.960
We did it. Okay, that's not accurate.

01:34.960 --> 01:38.640
On trends like these, I called it. I said that this would happen and it

01:38.640 --> 01:40.720
would be the most successful Pride month ever.

01:42.400 --> 01:47.200
I would say I made gay marriage legal. Well, I'm not sure that's accurate.

01:47.200 --> 01:50.560
You and the five cool members of the Supreme Court...

01:50.560 --> 01:52.880
Who know how to hang. Who know exactly how to hang.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.200
The other four, I don't think they've ever even...

01:55.200 --> 01:58.000
I don't think they know the definition of the word to hang.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.840
It's two words. We can all agree they are L7 weenies.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.680
But now they got to be cool because guess what?

02:03.680 --> 02:07.120
They got to all get gay married to each other. Luckily, there's four of them.

02:07.120 --> 02:10.080
And so there's a nice pairing off there, two and two.

02:10.080 --> 02:16.080
Considering according... As far as I can tell, this show is also,

02:16.080 --> 02:19.200
in addition to a bad advice show, is the Travis McElroy News Minute.

02:19.200 --> 02:23.120
Maybe we shouldn't goof about what is actually happening on Earth

02:23.120 --> 02:25.360
because I think Travis might walk away.

02:25.360 --> 02:29.840
We may never get another chance to update him on this situation.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.640
Listen, if it's not on BuzzFeed, I don't know about it.

02:32.640 --> 02:36.320
It's got to be on BuzzFeed. God damn to you, it's on BuzzFeed.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.720
It's all of BuzzFeed. Guaranteed.

02:39.520 --> 02:40.720
BuzzFeed.geocities.

02:42.880 --> 02:46.080
Kids react to gay marriage becoming the law of the land.

02:46.080 --> 02:49.600
Uh, so gay marriage...

02:50.640 --> 02:51.520
Hot button issue.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.880
It's not even a hot button issue anymore. It's just like, yes.

02:59.600 --> 03:04.800
It's just like, yeah, of course. It's like, of course.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.400
That's what this... Did you guys read the majority declaration?

03:08.400 --> 03:11.440
That's what they call it in the court cases that the five of them wrote.

03:11.440 --> 03:15.120
It's just like, yeah. And the dissenting opinion was all like,

03:15.120 --> 03:16.960
I don't know, it should be left up to the state

03:16.960 --> 03:18.640
because the way I interpret the 14th...

03:18.640 --> 03:22.080
And the majority is just like, dudes, yes.

03:22.960 --> 03:23.760
Travis?

03:23.760 --> 03:24.000
Yes?

03:26.080 --> 03:28.000
I just went to BuzzFeed on a whim.

03:28.640 --> 03:32.560
The front page of BuzzFeed is the gayest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.800
Oh, okay. Yeah, there it all is.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.640
Okay, good.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.480
I'm so happy. This is great news to wake up to.

03:40.480 --> 03:44.560
Yeah, I can imagine. God, if only every morning we could wake up

03:44.560 --> 03:46.560
and it's like, well, now I'm going to say a thing.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.040
This is the Griffin McElroy false equivalence hour.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.040
Do you guys feel like because you are...

03:51.040 --> 03:52.400
Well, Griffin, you're two hours ahead.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.000
And Justin, you're three hours ahead of me.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.680
That it's a little bit like early edition.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.840
And you walked out to your front door-

03:57.840 --> 04:00.640
The Kyle Chandler psychic cat show?

04:00.640 --> 04:02.080
Yeah, the cat's sitting on the newspaper.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.760
He shoots the cat away in the front page story.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.200
He's like, gay marriage is totally illegal.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.520
And you're like, I have to kill Travis in the past.

04:07.520 --> 04:14.160
I am, by the way, my hot new thing, I am deeply into people

04:14.160 --> 04:15.520
saying they're moving to Canada.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.200
One slight issue.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.920
One slight issue, which you may have heard about

04:19.920 --> 04:26.080
in the past decade, literally, literally decade.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.840
Listen, we've said a lot.

04:27.840 --> 04:28.800
We don't have a lot of jokes.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.000
No, we're just shooting for the hip.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.520
It's literally, it's breaking news.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.120
It's Friday, we're recording this.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.160
I'm like stoked.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.680
And we're just so excited to get to break the news

04:35.680 --> 04:37.360
to Travis that he has to marry a guy.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.320
I'm so excited.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.720
Teresa will be devastated, but she'll get to marry a woman.

04:40.720 --> 04:44.400
So like, good for everybody.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.240
It's the easy out she's been waiting for.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.240
Thanks, Uncle Sam.

04:50.720 --> 04:51.600
So that's excellent.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.120
I don't know, I'm pretty happy about that.

04:53.120 --> 04:57.360
Let's do like a, let's do like our advice show.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.840
Hey, let's do an earnest ass episode this week.

04:59.840 --> 05:00.560
What do you say?

05:00.560 --> 05:02.560
Earnest from the hip, you know what I mean?

05:02.560 --> 05:05.600
That's where I keep my earnestness, in my earnestness gun.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.840
Well, good, because I think the first question is somebody

05:07.840 --> 05:11.360
will really be able to help with our earnestness and our answers

05:11.360 --> 05:12.720
and our emotions.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.800
The other night, I got quite intoxicated

05:15.440 --> 05:17.280
during my ride home in an Uber.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.640
No drinking and driving for me.

05:18.640 --> 05:19.440
What do you want to meddle?

05:19.440 --> 05:20.160
Yeah, great.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.000
Cool, cool job, Law Follower.

05:22.000 --> 05:22.640
Excellent.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.600
So we gotta do two parades today.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.360
One for gay people getting married

05:29.360 --> 05:34.000
and one for you not fucking careening into a telephone pole.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.560
Okay, I ordered pizza from a prominent chain.

05:36.560 --> 05:40.320
The only one open till 3 a.m., Dominio's.

05:40.320 --> 05:44.000
Now I passed out when I got home in my drunken stupor.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.040
The driver tried to call me, but I was not waking up.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.240
Now here's the problem.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.880
I elected to pay cash online when I ordered,

05:50.880 --> 05:53.040
so they couldn't charge me for either the pizza

05:53.040 --> 05:54.160
or being an asshole feed.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.600
What's my next move?

05:55.600 --> 05:56.960
And how long do I have to wait

05:56.960 --> 05:59.120
before drunkenly ordering from Domino's again?

05:59.840 --> 06:03.200
It's from pizza perpetrator in Pittsburgh.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.560
I like the phrase, what's my next move?

06:06.560 --> 06:07.760
Checkmate, Dominio's.

06:09.280 --> 06:09.760
The day is mine.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.480
Why does Domino's let you choose the cash option

06:12.480 --> 06:13.360
after midnight?

06:14.160 --> 06:14.960
That's a good point.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.040
That's actually a really good point, Travis.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.680
They should be like, $11.59.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.600
Okay, now it's credit cards only.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.280
You should have to pay a security deposit.

06:25.280 --> 06:28.480
Yeah, you should only be able to obtain contractual pizza

06:28.480 --> 06:29.520
after midnight.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.800
There should definitely be some sort of mortgage put in place,

06:32.800 --> 06:33.840
scan your photo ID.

06:36.240 --> 06:40.320
You gotta be careful because the Domino's app

06:41.040 --> 06:45.200
is a sign of the coming future world

06:45.200 --> 06:47.200
that we're all gonna live in, whether you like it or not.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.440
The snow crash-esque world we're all gonna live in,

06:51.440 --> 06:53.120
where pizza is the only food,

06:53.120 --> 06:55.600
and the only way you can get it is through applications

06:55.600 --> 06:59.600
that you access through your virtual reality biopod, right?

07:00.160 --> 07:01.840
And if you get blacklisted,

07:01.840 --> 07:03.680
you get blackballed by Dominio's,

07:03.680 --> 07:04.160
guess what?

07:04.160 --> 07:06.400
You don't eat anymore because that's it.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.280
That's the only thing.

07:07.280 --> 07:07.920
What are you gonna do?

07:07.920 --> 07:09.600
Go outside and fight the cyber dogs?

07:09.600 --> 07:10.080
No way.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.520
Here's the horrifying thing no one tells you about those apps.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.200
Pizza tracking works both ways.

07:16.000 --> 07:16.800
That's true.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.720
It's now moving through your bowels.

07:18.720 --> 07:22.160
Well, I'm saying they're tracking you like Steve failed to pay Domino's.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.280
Spread the word.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.480
I imagine you probably,

07:25.200 --> 07:27.760
I would think everybody gets one of these, right?

07:27.760 --> 07:32.400
Everybody gets one of these like crank calls,

07:32.400 --> 07:33.840
whoa, wait a minute.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.040
That's what you tell them.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.640
I'm sure they're still stewing about this in every Dominos in America.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.240
So call any Dominos and say,

07:40.240 --> 07:41.840
listen, I just wanted to apologize.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.000
I heard on the deep web,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I heard some rumors that I had been,

07:47.200 --> 07:48.400
that I was being spoofed,

07:48.400 --> 07:50.480
and someone tried to send a pizza to my house,

07:50.480 --> 07:53.040
and I'm sorry, as you can tell, it was very late.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.880
I had church in the morning.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.080
I was already asleep,

07:56.080 --> 07:58.960
and I am very sorry that you were pranked by that.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.280
On a side related note,

08:01.280 --> 08:04.880
do you still have that pizza somewhere?

08:04.880 --> 08:08.320
Because I feel like for my pain and suffering,

08:08.320 --> 08:10.640
it's the least that you could do to set this right.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.000
Do you know whose fault this really is?

08:12.560 --> 08:13.120
Obama's?

08:13.840 --> 08:14.720
The Uber driver.

08:15.280 --> 08:16.080
Oh yeah.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.160
You wouldn't have gotten away with this shit in Lyft.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.280
Lyft driver's your buddy.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.400
Lyft driver would have been like,

08:20.400 --> 08:23.840
hey, maybe just put the phone down.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.160
Hey, this isn't a good idea right now.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.680
It's 2.59.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.520
They don't want to, oh, please don't.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.760
It's a good thing you didn't bail on your Uber,

08:31.760 --> 08:33.680
because those dudes will go ham.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.960
Last time I was in New York,

08:34.960 --> 08:36.400
I tried to hail an Uber,

08:36.400 --> 08:39.680
and they were supposed to pull up at the hotel I was staying at,

08:39.680 --> 08:41.520
and then I got a call from them,

08:41.520 --> 08:45.520
and it was basically like the Riddler was calling me like,

08:45.520 --> 08:47.680
fiddle dee dee, come find me.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.680
I'm in a parking garage that's green.

08:49.680 --> 08:53.040
And I failed, and I got an angry call from him,

08:53.040 --> 08:54.640
and that was the worst day of my life.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.040
That has happened to me a couple of times with Uber.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.160
Like, come get me.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.760
You have GPS.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.440
I've given you tracking abilities.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.480
Like, come get me.

09:02.480 --> 09:03.520
The game is on.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.960
The most dangerous game.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.560
Can you find my black sedan?

09:07.280 --> 09:08.720
It's a Nissan Altima.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.080
Or is it?

09:10.640 --> 09:12.160
It's my wife's.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.760
Find, in this word jumble,

09:13.760 --> 09:16.560
you will find the make and model of my car.

09:17.520 --> 09:18.640
But you'll never find me.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.240
You'll never find me. I'm in a plane.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.320
Would, could you, I mean,

09:24.320 --> 09:26.560
the thing about Domino's is it's a machine.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.320
You, it's a, it's a machine,

09:28.320 --> 09:31.120
and any effort you make to try to rectify the situation,

09:31.120 --> 09:33.600
like, is only gonna come up the works more.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.000
You cannot expect to be able to call and say,

09:36.640 --> 09:38.640
hey, listen, can you get me on the phone

09:38.640 --> 09:41.440
with whoever was working at 2 a.m. last Friday?

09:42.320 --> 09:45.280
I need to, I need to set something right.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.960
They're gonna, they're gonna think you're a creep.

09:46.960 --> 09:51.680
I mean, life is all about giving yourself little gifts, right?

09:51.680 --> 09:53.920
That's that Twin Peaks style of living, right?

09:53.920 --> 09:55.680
You do something nice for yourself every day.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.440
Just one little nice thing for yourself every day.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.440
And this was your nice thing to yourself every day,

09:59.440 --> 10:02.480
and this particular night that you didn't give yourself diarrhea.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.840
And to waste someone else's 20 minutes.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.360
So that was pretty nice of you.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.200
Well, I'm trying to run the math on this.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.400
Like, who is hurting?

10:10.400 --> 10:12.080
I don't care about hurting Domino's.

10:12.080 --> 10:15.360
They're, they're, they're a multi-billion dollar corporation.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.480
They can handle that.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.200
They can handle it.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.600
I'm, I'm a little worried about the driver.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.120
He's getting paid an hourly rate.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.440
He was obviously cheated out of his tip.

10:23.440 --> 10:26.800
But like, realistically, he was probably doing a lot of deliveries.

10:26.800 --> 10:27.120
Yeah.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.160
So you couldn't have cost him more than like 10 minutes

10:30.160 --> 10:32.400
driving out of his way and ran out the door and finding.

10:32.400 --> 10:36.720
But also, Justin, delivery drivers usually pay for their own gas.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.240
That's what like delivery charge and tips cover.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.160
I'm not saying it's a victimless crime, Travis.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.080
I'm just trying to mitigate how guilty he should feel.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.120
Well, well, I'll say this.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.840
Domino's actually, I've got some insider.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.800
My dad's on the board of directors of Domino's.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.440
My dad, my secret dad that you two don't have.

10:54.400 --> 11:00.560
And they're actually in a perpetual state of being one pizza away from bankruptcy.

11:01.360 --> 11:01.920
Just one.

11:01.920 --> 11:06.000
If one pizza situation does not go down as intended, that's it for them.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.280
Maybe he'll come in tomorrow and pay for it.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.640
That'll never happen, sir.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.400
Gentlemen, it's been an honor.

11:12.400 --> 11:18.800
The band starts playing like the fiddlers, like I'm going down with the Domino's.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.120
Hello, is this Papa John?

11:24.560 --> 11:27.520
You have fought a good fright, old friend.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.400
And I fear this is where we part ways.

11:31.120 --> 11:35.360
If you'd like to buy, well, you can just send over some of your boxes

11:35.360 --> 11:37.680
and we'll put them in your boxes.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.840
We've got a few in the oven right now.

11:39.840 --> 11:43.920
Well, I'm not sure if you want those two.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.200
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

11:45.200 --> 11:45.840
Sure, yeah.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.680
This Yahoo was sent in by level 9000.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.520
Yahoo Drew, Drew Davenport.

11:49.520 --> 11:50.000
Thank you, Drew.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Marlene who asks,

11:54.560 --> 11:59.680
why do big beautiful men love putting so much seasonings on their food?

12:01.040 --> 12:02.000
Big beautiful men.

12:02.960 --> 12:07.920
Why do big beautiful men love putting so much seasonings on their food?

12:07.920 --> 12:11.040
Why do BBMs put the season, okay, got it.

12:11.040 --> 12:15.280
Speaking as a BBM, I can say that a lot of time the zest has,

12:16.080 --> 12:20.000
it takes it a while to permeate my various layers.

12:20.000 --> 12:20.640
What do you mean?

12:20.640 --> 12:21.680
Describe it.

12:21.680 --> 12:24.240
A zest enough for a regular sized person.

12:24.240 --> 12:27.120
There's enough zest on here for a regular sized person to keep them,

12:27.120 --> 12:28.240
keep their motor running.

12:29.760 --> 12:35.840
I have not gotten to be a big beautiful man by eating bland, flavorless food, right?

12:35.840 --> 12:38.480
I've eaten a lot of different food with a lot of different flavors.

12:38.480 --> 12:43.040
So as a BBM, I need that next level.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.040
And a lot of times the other thing about it,

12:45.040 --> 12:47.040
this is one of the big facets of it.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.800
Really pulling the curtain back, Justin.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.280
Yeah, I'm part in the kimono today.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.880
One of the other things about it,

12:54.880 --> 12:57.520
which is my least favorite idiom on the planet.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.480
One of the other things about it is that a lot of times as a BBM,

13:02.480 --> 13:04.320
you have to eat when you're not hungry.

13:04.320 --> 13:08.480
Because maybe you're bored or sad.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.720
So how do you spice that up literally

13:12.720 --> 13:17.600
and help get all the calorie junk down your gullet space?

13:17.600 --> 13:18.880
Well, good news.

13:18.880 --> 13:19.840
There's zest.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.240
If something's a little salty or spicy,

13:22.240 --> 13:24.800
sometimes it can help you forget that you don't need it.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.360
I remember one time you cooked me up a ham hock

13:27.360 --> 13:30.560
and I tried to eat it and it burned my mouth.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.000
Not from the temperature of it,

13:32.000 --> 13:35.440
but there was just so much like Parmesan and oregano on it

13:35.440 --> 13:37.680
and my mouth couldn't even comprehend the flavors.

13:37.680 --> 13:40.240
I hadn't developed the brain mass needed

13:40.240 --> 13:42.960
to take those flavors, separate them out mentally,

13:42.960 --> 13:47.600
and experience them all in these individual compartments.

13:47.600 --> 13:48.000
Yeah.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.080
Justin, if I may ask, when we talk about BBM zest,

13:53.520 --> 13:56.240
are we talking like a Lowry seasoning salt

13:56.240 --> 13:58.480
or like an Italian seasoning

13:58.480 --> 14:02.640
or some kind of just like a dry rub sprinkled onto a food

14:02.640 --> 14:04.000
after it's finished cooking?

14:05.200 --> 14:06.960
That's kind of for commoners.

14:06.960 --> 14:10.480
Usually what I'll do is just use a grater on a salt lick

14:10.480 --> 14:12.560
or maybe just throw some gunpowder on there.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.160
That's some next level flavor technology.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.760
Yeah, it really, yeah.

14:19.360 --> 14:23.360
You do what you have to keep yourself

14:23.360 --> 14:24.640
in the heavyweight class, you know?

14:24.640 --> 14:25.440
So what's next?

14:25.440 --> 14:25.920
What's next?

14:25.920 --> 14:27.280
Like pencil shavings?

14:27.280 --> 14:31.360
Yeah, pencil shavings are great because free fiber, right?

14:31.360 --> 14:32.080
Yeah.

14:32.080 --> 14:36.000
And that's what a lot of people are gonna go to that first.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.800
You know what scares me, what keeps me up at night,

14:38.800 --> 14:42.800
that I'm worried the only flavor that's extreme enough for me

14:43.360 --> 14:48.160
that like I will be able to really get something out of

14:48.160 --> 14:52.240
is one, meteorite dust, two, ground up dodo bones.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.240
And that second one is problematic.

14:56.240 --> 14:56.480
Sure.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.360
That's obviously gonna be a big part of my day.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.200
So I've got to lean towards meteorite dust.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.720
Let me ask you a question.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.600
Does umami even do anything for you anymore?

15:05.600 --> 15:06.880
When was the last time you experienced

15:06.880 --> 15:08.880
a good true umami flavor?

15:08.880 --> 15:10.320
The last time I experienced umami

15:10.320 --> 15:12.080
was before the idea of umami was invented.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.040
So I didn't even know what I was just like.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.040
Right now in my 34 year old mind,

15:20.640 --> 15:22.720
savory is like a dream I invented.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.880
You can't put enough savory on something

15:24.880 --> 15:26.080
for me to taste it anymore.

15:26.080 --> 15:26.400
I feel that.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.720
Justin, could we use modern day technology

15:28.720 --> 15:32.080
to like 3D print some kind of zest

15:32.080 --> 15:32.480
that would really do it for you?

15:32.480 --> 15:34.320
Some kind of new zest?

15:34.320 --> 15:34.560
Yeah.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.920
That like cutting edge Jurassic World shit

15:37.920 --> 15:40.560
where we mix in a bunch of different zest

15:40.560 --> 15:42.160
and also some cuttlefish.

15:42.160 --> 15:45.120
We end up with like the zest of the zest, right?

15:45.120 --> 15:47.520
Like this is the zest you put on zest

15:47.520 --> 15:49.040
to make zest more flavorful.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.000
And here's what we'll call it.

15:50.000 --> 15:50.720
You guys ready for this?

15:50.720 --> 15:53.600
This is a new flavor variant, right?

15:53.600 --> 15:54.720
You got your bitter, you got your sweet,

15:54.720 --> 15:58.080
your sour, this is a new thing altogether.

15:58.080 --> 16:03.040
And this hyper powerful zest taste

16:03.040 --> 16:04.480
is gonna be called umami.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.080
Oh no, wait, I said it wrong.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.360
Umami.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.200
And that's what you'll say every time

16:09.200 --> 16:10.800
you put it on like a pizza crust.

16:10.800 --> 16:11.920
The sixth flavor.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.840
The seventh, it's the seventh flavor.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.240
Oh, umami.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.600
Umami.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.160
Yeah.

16:18.160 --> 16:19.040
That's what they're creating

16:19.040 --> 16:20.400
with the Large Hadron Collider.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.640
As soon as that thing shuts off,

16:22.640 --> 16:23.840
they're gonna go over there

16:23.840 --> 16:25.680
with a Hoover and a salt shaker

16:25.680 --> 16:26.800
and they're just gonna suck it up

16:26.800 --> 16:28.720
and be like, okay, we got enough here

16:28.720 --> 16:31.920
to make one dinner taste good for the J-Man.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.080
Gotta shit this FedEx Double Express.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.920
They're firing a fun-sized packet

16:35.920 --> 16:41.520
of sour Skittles at a BW3's Inferno level Buffalo wing.

16:41.520 --> 16:42.800
And when they collide in the middle,

16:42.800 --> 16:44.160
oh, umami.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.680
That's what the scientists will say.

16:47.680 --> 16:48.880
Do you mean eureka?

16:48.880 --> 16:50.960
No, I'm doing a thing.

16:50.960 --> 16:51.520
Leave me alone.

16:52.160 --> 16:52.720
Leave me alone.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.720
I'm trying to get this thing.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.280
My name is Daniel

16:57.280 --> 16:58.960
and I'm the guy running the Large Hadron Collider

16:58.960 --> 17:03.920
and I invent a new part of the flavor spectrum

17:03.920 --> 17:06.400
that has not been discovered before.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.640
That only Hummingbirds and BBMs can taste?

17:08.640 --> 17:10.320
Yeah, only Hummingbirds and BBMs can taste

17:10.320 --> 17:11.520
my new part of the flavor spectrum

17:11.520 --> 17:12.000
that I discovered.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.800
There's no way I'm not trying to name it after myself.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.240
There's no way I'm not gonna call like,

17:16.240 --> 17:16.960
oh, this?

17:16.960 --> 17:18.000
This is Daniel taste.

17:18.000 --> 17:23.120
I'm getting a little bit of, is that black pepper?

17:24.320 --> 17:25.600
Is that Daniel taste?

17:25.600 --> 17:27.600
That is Daniel taste.

17:27.600 --> 17:30.560
That'll be the subtitle of the flavor.

17:30.560 --> 17:31.600
It's umami.

17:31.600 --> 17:32.560
The Daniel taste.

17:34.560 --> 17:37.200
And it'll be as bitter as Swiss chard

17:37.200 --> 17:39.040
and a trillion Scoville units.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.960
Ah, my mouth burns, but it's so sweet.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.880
I'm dead now from Daniel taste.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.040
Oh, my mouth is puckering, but it's on fire.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.000
What the hell?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.120
What is going on?

17:47.120 --> 17:48.480
Daniel's the only one who can taste it

17:48.480 --> 17:50.880
without going immediately completely insane.

17:53.040 --> 17:53.600
But you know what?

17:53.600 --> 17:55.840
It's on a nice ham hock, it's worth it.

17:55.840 --> 17:56.400
Oh, for sure.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.760
What do you do about a friend who won't

17:59.760 --> 18:01.600
stop recommending TV shows to you?

18:01.600 --> 18:04.240
It's not a situation where she suggests things

18:04.240 --> 18:06.320
she thinks are good and leaves it up to me.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.720
She's constantly checking in to make sure

18:08.720 --> 18:10.800
I've watched a particular show she thinks I'd like

18:10.800 --> 18:13.760
because it has a character of my race or sexuality.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.760
Woof.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.560
Her current favorite is My Mad Fat Diary,

18:18.560 --> 18:20.640
which quote reminds her of me.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.800
How do I tell her that I'm just not interested

18:24.800 --> 18:27.280
and her pestering is getting annoying?

18:27.280 --> 18:29.440
That's from your mad fat friend.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.920
Are you throwing friend around liberally here?

18:31.920 --> 18:34.320
Yeah, that's a loose use of the word friend.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.040
Oh, it's a real show.

18:37.600 --> 18:38.400
What happens on this?

18:38.400 --> 18:39.440
Give me a little context.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.600
What happens on My Mad Fat Diary?

18:41.600 --> 18:44.880
Set in Stamford, Lincolnshire in the mid 1990s,

18:44.880 --> 18:47.920
My Mad Fat Diary follows the story of a 16 year old,

18:47.920 --> 18:50.240
16 stone girl, Ray Earl.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.400
She's made out of 16 stones?

18:54.400 --> 18:56.800
She's like a rock monster?

18:57.600 --> 19:01.520
Griffin, that's how people weigh themselves in the UK.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.360
Yeah, it's 224 pounds, Griffin.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.120
Because that's how much all stones weigh there.

19:07.120 --> 19:09.440
They've got the most uniform stones.

19:09.440 --> 19:15.360
So the math on that 16 times 14 is this woman weighs 1200 pounds.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.000
No, that's not accurate.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.200
What a weird metric to recommend.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.800
I guess I'm not really getting the full experience of this

19:24.800 --> 19:26.080
because I'm a white straight dude.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.400
And so people are like, dude, you got to see the shows.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.680
24 friends, like all of them, man.

19:31.680 --> 19:33.680
All the shows, you're going to love them.

19:33.680 --> 19:37.200
Watch basically any show besides The L Word.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.240
Just watch any show.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.520
Dude, have you seen Castle?

19:39.520 --> 19:40.720
He has a great joke about that,

19:40.720 --> 19:42.400
where he talks about people talking to him

19:42.400 --> 19:43.600
about Slumdog Millionaire.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.960
And he's like, what's it like to be white?

19:44.960 --> 19:46.320
He was like, Mad Men, that's us.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.240
It must be so great.

19:48.240 --> 19:50.400
I feel like I'm watching all the TV shows already.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.600
I got my Master Chef.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.960
I've got my Dancing with the Stars,

19:54.960 --> 19:56.240
or not my Dancing with the Stars,

19:56.240 --> 19:58.160
my So You Think You Can Dance with the Stars.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.000
You Think You're Hot Shit.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.080
Hey, I've got You Think You're Hot Shit, huh?

20:02.080 --> 20:03.360
Dance with These Stars.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.240
Hey, tough guy.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.080
You think you can dance?

20:06.080 --> 20:06.960
Go fuck yourself.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.080
Hey, you clumsy piece of shit.

20:08.080 --> 20:10.160
Get on that dance floor and humiliate yourself.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.200
You think you can dance?

20:11.200 --> 20:12.800
I never said that.

20:12.800 --> 20:13.520
Oh yeah?

20:13.520 --> 20:14.640
Well, get out there and do it.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.800
No, I never claimed I could dance.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.080
That's the show I want to be on.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.680
I never claimed I could dance.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.280
Why are you making me do this?

20:21.280 --> 20:23.120
Please, God, just let me sit down.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.680
Can you just say to her, like when she's like,

20:25.680 --> 20:28.640
you got to check out this show, be like, nah, you know, no.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.280
Well, I already watched enough shows.

20:31.280 --> 20:34.080
I have another thing, Travis.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.080
It's basically like that, but the opposite.

20:36.080 --> 20:36.320
Okay.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.160
Just say you did and then see how long-

20:38.160 --> 20:39.680
What if she quizzes you?

20:39.680 --> 20:40.240
So what?

20:40.960 --> 20:43.680
Tell me what happened in minute 15 of episode four.

20:44.480 --> 20:48.560
I think it would be a fun game for yourself to keep things fresh

20:48.560 --> 20:52.720
to just see how long you could feign that you had watched this show.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.120
And then never admit that you're lying.

20:55.120 --> 20:55.840
Yeah, right.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.680
Never, ever admit to-

20:57.680 --> 20:59.360
Just say you must've seen a different edit

20:59.360 --> 21:02.800
or like you watched some deleted features on the web.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.640
Extended scenes.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.880
Are you sure we're talking about the same show

21:06.880 --> 21:09.120
and let your friend continuously try to be like,

21:09.120 --> 21:12.400
yeah, the one with the girl, she weighs like 16 stone.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.240
Yeah, no, I know.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.400
And then like she has the invisible friend.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.360
No, no.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.120
She lives in a small town.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.400
Yeah, no, I know.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.880
And she rides like the big pink motor scooter

21:22.880 --> 21:25.440
that's like bigger than any other scooter in town, right?

21:25.440 --> 21:26.000
Like, no.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.840
Okay, I see what happened here.

21:29.840 --> 21:34.240
I see, I used some codes I found inside

21:34.800 --> 21:37.200
some specially marked containers of Snapple

21:37.760 --> 21:41.520
to get some exclusive scenes and some exclusive wallpapers

21:42.080 --> 21:44.160
that I downloaded for true fans.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.520
For my Motorola Razr.

21:45.520 --> 21:46.880
They're Razr wallpapers.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.240
So maybe you were like,

21:48.240 --> 21:51.360
are you exchanging the Snapple points to get all the bonuses?

21:51.360 --> 21:53.200
Oh, I thought you said you liked the show.

21:53.200 --> 21:56.000
Oh, yeah, I thought you were really into it.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.320
You should not only do this,

21:58.320 --> 22:03.360
you should then lie about your experience

22:03.360 --> 22:05.120
watching My Big Fat So-Called Life

22:05.680 --> 22:13.840
and then make a fan site based on your take on the show.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.760
So you have some like evidence to direct you to,

22:15.760 --> 22:17.600
like this is where the true fans hang

22:17.600 --> 22:19.600
and see how long you can keep that delusion going.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.880
That's your own show.

22:20.880 --> 22:21.840
You just catfished.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.000
Then if they want you to watch Catfish,

22:24.000 --> 22:25.440
now you got another problem.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.120
Oh, I just have a little box at the bottom

22:27.120 --> 22:29.120
where she can submit her Snapple points.

22:29.120 --> 22:30.400
But instead of having a counter

22:30.400 --> 22:32.320
of how many more Snapple points she needs,

22:32.320 --> 22:34.480
just have it every time say almost there

22:35.120 --> 22:36.960
and then see if you can get your friend

22:36.960 --> 22:39.200
to blow all of her money on Snapple.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.520
Which is funny because it's good for you,

22:41.520 --> 22:42.960
but it's also good for Snapple

22:42.960 --> 22:44.240
because I think they need it.

22:44.240 --> 22:45.120
Yeah, and good for them

22:45.120 --> 22:48.240
because that shit's just basically a vitamin slurry.

22:48.240 --> 22:51.200
I need you to go out and get on the internet

22:51.200 --> 22:55.520
and memorize the names of like 10 super obscure

22:55.520 --> 22:57.680
anime television series.

22:57.680 --> 22:58.720
And then every time she's like,

22:58.720 --> 22:59.520
let me hit you with this,

22:59.520 --> 23:02.480
my big fat Greek TV show.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.120
You say, that's interesting.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.840
Now, as is part of our arrangement,

23:07.840 --> 23:11.280
I have a deep web anime recommendation for you.

23:12.000 --> 23:17.600
You could suggest to her that she watch movies

23:17.600 --> 23:20.080
that are impossible to be,

23:22.240 --> 23:23.600
that you can't find.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.960
Like Home Alone 6?

23:24.960 --> 23:26.320
Like lost films.

23:26.320 --> 23:29.600
I'm talking like, yeah, I would love to watch that.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.600
Will you hit me back once you've watched

23:31.600 --> 23:34.560
the Jitterbug scene from Wizard of Oz

23:35.520 --> 23:36.640
and they'll never find it.

23:36.640 --> 23:37.600
And that way you like,

23:37.600 --> 23:39.600
then you have something to hold over their head.

23:39.600 --> 23:40.480
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

23:41.120 --> 23:41.840
Please.

23:41.840 --> 23:42.560
Here's the Yahoo.

23:42.560 --> 23:43.920
I'm gonna drop on all y'all.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.960
And it's by, it was sent in by,

23:46.960 --> 23:48.720
recognize the game of Rachel Sperling.

23:49.280 --> 23:50.080
Take a moment.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.080
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user Drew.

23:52.080 --> 23:52.960
So I don't know if maybe

23:52.960 --> 23:55.200
there's some crossover effort happening here.

23:56.400 --> 24:01.360
Drew asks, is it bad to eat only five Cheetos a day?

24:02.320 --> 24:04.560
I've been eating extremely healthy for a while

24:04.560 --> 24:08.000
and my body is starting to look pretty damn good.

24:09.040 --> 24:13.360
So would eating only five hot Cheetos a day

24:13.360 --> 24:15.040
affect anything that much?

24:15.040 --> 24:16.960
Or is the quantity so low,

24:16.960 --> 24:18.640
it would barely do anything at all?

24:18.640 --> 24:23.360
Now, I am assuming this person means

24:23.360 --> 24:26.160
they are not eating more than five Cheetos a day

24:26.160 --> 24:27.760
and not that their entire,

24:27.760 --> 24:33.280
they are subsisting completely on a quintet of Cheetos.

24:33.280 --> 24:33.840
Gotcha.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.080
That's how I read the title at first.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.840
You just have two Cheetos for breakfast,

24:37.840 --> 24:38.400
two for lunch,

24:38.400 --> 24:40.080
and then a sensible dinner of one Cheeto.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.800
Well, you don't wanna have bad dreams.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.800
How many calories you guys think are in a Cheeto?

24:44.800 --> 24:48.000
I mean, it depends, right?

24:48.000 --> 24:50.480
Like they're not pressed.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.160
You know, they're not stamped out.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.440
There's variation.

24:54.480 --> 24:55.600
If you had to guess.

24:55.600 --> 24:58.640
I would say about 80 calories per Cheeto.

24:58.640 --> 24:59.920
Yeah, that sounds right.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.640
I would say like half a stone of calories.

25:02.640 --> 25:04.000
Half a stone of calories.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.480
Is it bad to eat only five though?

25:08.480 --> 25:11.360
I mean, God, God, the restraint on this person,

25:11.360 --> 25:13.120
the self-control on this person.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.080
Do you think they have a special doctor

25:16.080 --> 25:17.360
that comes to their house

25:17.360 --> 25:19.440
and like gives them their prescription every day?

25:19.440 --> 25:20.880
Because if you have a bag there,

25:20.880 --> 25:25.520
five Cheetos is gonna turn into five score Cheetos.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.000
Five Cheetos.

25:26.000 --> 25:26.720
Nobody's ever,

25:26.720 --> 25:29.520
did you guys know that nobody's ever closed a bag of Cheetos?

25:29.520 --> 25:30.480
This is actually true.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.000
People either empty the bag and then tilt it up

25:34.000 --> 25:36.080
and get all that good, good stuff.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.320
Or they leave it open.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.000
They're like, oh, never again.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.920
They're just gonna get crunchier.

25:41.920 --> 25:45.040
Yeah, I think that the problem becomes

25:45.040 --> 25:48.400
eventually your routine will grow so ingrained

25:48.400 --> 25:50.800
that if you ever only eat four Cheetos

25:50.800 --> 25:53.040
or accidentally eat six, you'll die.

25:54.000 --> 25:54.960
Oh no.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.880
Because you'll achieve a perfect balance

25:56.880 --> 25:58.400
in this human machine.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.760
And then eventually if your body's like,

26:01.760 --> 26:03.280
wait, there was only four Cheetos,

26:03.280 --> 26:07.120
it'll go into basically like septic shock and you'll die.

26:07.120 --> 26:07.760
Yeah.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.680
Now I'm not a doctor, mind you,

26:09.680 --> 26:12.320
but I have had a lot of experience with Cheetos.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.160
I mean, they warn you right up front

26:14.160 --> 26:15.440
that they're dangerously cheesy.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.080
Dangerous.

26:17.680 --> 26:18.800
Dangerously cheesy.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.000
It also says in the package

26:20.000 --> 26:22.240
that if you eat exactly five of them every day,

26:22.240 --> 26:24.160
it's the equivalent of the limitless pill.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.000
And you'll be able to think super good

26:26.000 --> 26:28.080
and you'll be able to get a big bank job.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.960
But the government's gonna come after you.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.880
I have not seen the movie Limitless.

26:32.880 --> 26:33.920
That's basically what happens.

26:33.920 --> 26:37.120
He eats some Cheetos and it makes him really efficient.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.360
And that's why it's a fantasy movie.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.960
It would make you efficient, wouldn't it?

26:40.960 --> 26:43.680
These beautiful waypoints throughout your day,

26:43.680 --> 26:46.800
these beautiful check markers, these checkpoints.

26:46.800 --> 26:50.160
Ooh boy, almost time for my 10 a.m. Cheeto.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.240
I better get some work done so I can really earn it.

26:52.800 --> 26:55.200
You've just turned this whole thing around for me, Griffin.

26:55.200 --> 26:58.000
Cause I assumed it was like handful five Cheetos,

26:58.000 --> 27:01.920
flip them in and like, oh, that was my like midday snack.

27:01.920 --> 27:05.200
You're saying parse it out throughout the day

27:05.200 --> 27:07.920
or maybe reward yourselves for little achievements.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.000
Like took the garbage out, Cheeto.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.120
Like finished that term paper I was working on, Cheeto.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.920
Like to set them up as goalposts throughout the day.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.040
Now we're onto something.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.240
I can get behind this.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.880
But then some days you just have shithead days

27:20.880 --> 27:23.040
where you just sit around and play Destiny all day

27:23.040 --> 27:24.720
and you realize that, oh, it's 9 p.m.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.320
I didn't do anything.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.400
Better just slam these five Cheetos.

27:28.400 --> 27:29.680
Pomp, pomp, pomp, pomp, pomp.

27:29.680 --> 27:30.720
But then that's awesome

27:30.720 --> 27:32.240
cause you just ate a bunch of Cheetos.

27:32.240 --> 27:32.960
What am I talking about?

27:32.960 --> 27:35.360
And then you reward yourself with more Cheetos.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.200
No, God, no, no.

27:37.200 --> 27:37.920
Oh, you'll die.

27:37.920 --> 27:38.400
That's right.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.920
Did you guys know that in Japan

27:39.920 --> 27:41.680
there are Mountain Dew flavored Cheetos?

27:41.680 --> 27:42.180
Yeah.

27:43.520 --> 27:46.880
Why is Japan allowed to out America, America?

27:46.880 --> 27:49.120
Like, aren't they worried about infringing

27:49.120 --> 27:51.840
on our national copyright of being the worst?

27:55.040 --> 27:56.720
That's kind of her thing.

27:56.720 --> 27:57.120
Yeah.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.800
I mean, it's less than being the worst

27:58.800 --> 28:02.880
and more about like, I mean, the true Japanese style

28:02.880 --> 28:08.960
is like recognizes the possibility of food mashups.

28:08.960 --> 28:12.000
Like them pumpkin pie Kit Kats I ate all of.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.280
I was gonna bring them home for folks

28:13.280 --> 28:16.880
but then I was on the plane and I didn't just eat five.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.240
I ate maybe 30.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.520
The website, I went to find a picture of these

28:21.520 --> 28:24.880
cause I wanted to make sure I wasn't talking out of my ass

28:24.880 --> 28:26.240
before I said I was pretty sure existed.

28:26.240 --> 28:30.800
But there's a paragraph in the story I'm reading.

28:30.800 --> 28:34.080
It says, the move is probably not a huge surprise

28:34.080 --> 28:35.760
as Frito-Lay is the same company

28:35.760 --> 28:38.720
that introduced Pepsi flavored Cheetos last year.

28:38.720 --> 28:38.960
What?

28:38.960 --> 28:42.320
Do you know how fucked your world you have?

28:42.320 --> 28:46.080
Do you know how like, how like numb to the wonder

28:46.080 --> 28:48.400
of God's creation you have to be

28:48.400 --> 28:50.800
for you to see Mountain Dew flavored Cheetos

28:50.800 --> 28:53.200
and think, well, you know, it was bound to happen eventually.

28:53.200 --> 28:53.760
What?

28:53.760 --> 28:54.240
Oh, honey.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.120
Are you sure?

28:55.120 --> 28:58.000
Right here in the times, they done did it again.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.360
Law of large numbers.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.440
You get infinity monkeys on infinity typewriters.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.880
One was going to type out the whole works

29:02.880 --> 29:04.080
of William Shakespeare.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.240
We are the monkeys and the Shakespeare

29:06.240 --> 29:07.280
is a Mountain Dew Cheeto.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.640
Eventually we were going to do it.

29:08.640 --> 29:10.720
Yes, of course, somewhere in the universe

29:10.720 --> 29:12.320
someone's making Mountain Dew Cheetos.

29:12.320 --> 29:13.840
Of course, why not here?

29:13.840 --> 29:14.720
Why not us?

29:14.720 --> 29:16.400
I want Cheeto flavored Mountain Dew.

29:16.400 --> 29:19.360
Ooh, I mean, there is some kind of Cheeto beverage.

29:19.360 --> 29:22.880
Listen, listen, we've all said a lot of shit

29:22.880 --> 29:25.520
in the past few minutes, but Justin,

29:26.240 --> 29:28.720
how good would those Mountain Dew Cheetos be crumbled up

29:28.720 --> 29:30.800
and put on like some tilapia or something like that?

29:30.800 --> 29:34.320
That's an umami flavor I bet you can get into.

29:34.320 --> 29:35.760
Umami, a Daniel taste.

29:35.760 --> 29:38.640
It's sour, it's sweet, it's mud like.

29:38.640 --> 29:39.840
What is mud's flavor?

29:39.840 --> 29:40.800
Because it has it.

29:40.800 --> 29:43.280
Umami, a Daniel taste brand taste.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.680
See, he founded the Daniel taste corporation

29:45.680 --> 29:47.600
thinking that he would invent other tastes.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.000
Yeah.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.840
He flew too close to the sun though.

29:49.840 --> 29:50.960
Oh, it's lightning in a bottle.

29:50.960 --> 29:52.400
He's a one zest wonder.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.600
I just had a great idea

29:56.320 --> 29:58.400
and I'm going to throw out this money making idea.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.400
You guys tell me if you want to invest.

30:01.520 --> 30:02.560
You know, Lichamade?

30:03.760 --> 30:04.160
Yeah.

30:04.160 --> 30:07.120
Instead of sugar dust, it's just Cheeto dust in a bag.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.920
And then you have like maybe a pretzel stick

30:09.920 --> 30:11.280
or something that you dip in.

30:11.840 --> 30:14.480
I have something that might also work for that, Travis.

30:14.480 --> 30:14.800
What's that?

30:14.800 --> 30:15.520
Pretzel sticks.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.240
Um, Cheetos?

30:18.960 --> 30:20.560
Well, yes, Justin.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.200
But like, if you don't dare to dream,

30:23.200 --> 30:24.800
then like why even wake up in the morning

30:24.800 --> 30:26.400
and reward yourself with five Cheetos?

30:26.400 --> 30:30.560
Um, I have something else that you could dunk into it.

30:30.560 --> 30:30.880
Uh-huh.

30:31.680 --> 30:34.720
It's a key to a prison cell

30:34.720 --> 30:38.640
that you would be locked inside if you did this thing.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.080
Either created it or consumed it.

30:40.080 --> 30:43.280
There's a prison cell and it's deep in a mountain

30:43.280 --> 30:45.360
and no one's ever going to hear from you ever again.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.200
And that's where we will put you.

30:47.840 --> 30:50.880
I will say though that if you did do the original Travis plan

30:50.880 --> 30:53.280
of dipping pretzels with Cheeto dust,

30:53.280 --> 30:58.560
uh, the, the, uh, pretzel post snack

30:59.280 --> 31:00.800
after you've eaten all the Cheeto dust,

31:00.800 --> 31:04.720
the, the sloppy, slimy Wetzel, if you will,

31:05.520 --> 31:09.760
uh, would become the world's new number one leader,

31:10.400 --> 31:13.120
uh, uh, for thing that no,

31:13.120 --> 31:16.240
like the worst thing you could possibly eat.

31:16.240 --> 31:17.120
Mm-hmm.

31:17.120 --> 31:20.960
Narrowly edging out previous champion, a live sparrow.

31:20.960 --> 31:26.960
Oh man, this is going to be the episode

31:26.960 --> 31:28.080
that makes me stop eating food.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.000
I don't have it eventually.

31:30.000 --> 31:40.720
Let's go to the money zone.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.800
Me undies is dedicated to offering

31:42.800 --> 31:45.200
the most comfortable underwear on the planet.

31:45.200 --> 31:48.480
I'm wearing them right now and they are changing my butt life.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.720
And they're not just for guys.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.720
Even though I'm a guy, they're not just for guys.

31:52.720 --> 31:54.960
They got a new collection, uh, called all of me.

31:55.600 --> 31:59.280
It's a women's collection and it's a four piece line of undies

31:59.280 --> 32:03.600
designed specifically for the, uh, confusing angles

32:03.600 --> 32:05.440
and curves of the female form.

32:06.160 --> 32:10.720
Uh, uh, and the MC Escher like angles of a woman's body,

32:10.720 --> 32:15.680
the imperceptible warping of gone on in the contouring

32:15.680 --> 32:19.040
of the female form, the grain of the female form.

32:19.040 --> 32:21.040
I've been doing a lot of whittling.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.480
I, you can get 20% off of me undies,

32:24.480 --> 32:26.240
which really are fantastic.

32:26.880 --> 32:31.200
Uh, you can get a hundred percent off of me undies.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.960
You, you would pay twice as much for

32:32.960 --> 32:34.800
comfortable underwear of this quality,

32:34.800 --> 32:35.680
but you're not going to do that.

32:35.680 --> 32:40.640
Cause you know us, you can get 20% off of the already

32:40.640 --> 32:44.160
very reasonable me undies price by going to me undies.com

32:44.160 --> 32:51.280
slash my brother that's M E undies.com slash my brother.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.600
I wish I could take 20% off of my me undies

32:53.600 --> 32:55.680
and make a little window for my nuts.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.720
Wait, not your dick.

32:58.720 --> 32:59.680
Just your nuts.

32:59.680 --> 33:02.240
Don't, can we not, it's funny if you say nuts one time,

33:02.240 --> 33:04.400
if you say it a lot, then we'd start to sound like a,

33:04.400 --> 33:05.200
like Limp Bizkit.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.280
Good jerky boys CD.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.320
We have another sponsor speaking of nuts.

33:10.880 --> 33:11.600
And jerky.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.560
And Belgian waffles.

33:15.360 --> 33:18.160
Uh, this next sponsor is Nature Box.

33:18.160 --> 33:19.120
You know them, you love them.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.520
You eat them, you snack on them and you chew on them

33:21.520 --> 33:22.800
and you swallow them and they make you strong

33:22.800 --> 33:24.080
with all the nutrients in there.

33:24.080 --> 33:27.840
They're made from all art, all artificial flavors.

33:27.840 --> 33:28.880
Like ooh mommy.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.640
They're made with zero artificial flavors.

33:32.640 --> 33:36.480
The ooh mommy is, is totally all natural.

33:36.480 --> 33:39.280
Found deep, deep in the Mariana trench,

33:39.280 --> 33:42.080
buried in an alien pod, but it's real.

33:42.080 --> 33:43.520
They don't have any colors or sweeteners,

33:43.520 --> 33:46.480
zero grams trans fats and no high fructose corn syrup.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.480
You can get snacks like mini Belgian waffles,

33:48.480 --> 33:49.760
strawberry lemonade, fruit stars,

33:49.760 --> 33:51.760
and sweet and salty nut medley.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.120
All really, really tasty.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.360
If you go to naturebox.com slash my brother,

33:55.360 --> 33:58.000
you can get a free trial box of their favorite snacks.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.960
Again, that is naturebox.com slash my brother.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.720
Get yourself a free box of snacks.

34:02.720 --> 34:05.920
I got a message for Tori, who's the best big sister ever.

34:05.920 --> 34:09.920
And it's from Bess, who's the totally kick ass little sister.

34:09.920 --> 34:12.720
The message is this, message follows.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.280
To the bestest, most smartest,

34:15.280 --> 34:17.200
most beautiful as big sister ever.

34:17.200 --> 34:19.200
This is me publicly apologizing for that time

34:19.200 --> 34:20.560
I hit you in the face with a lightsaber.

34:20.560 --> 34:21.520
Happy birthday.

34:22.160 --> 34:22.960
I love you.

34:23.760 --> 34:26.400
PS, I still think you should have blocked it.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.040
That's it, yeah.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.360
Yeah, I mean, Tori, I don't want to throw shade

34:31.360 --> 34:32.880
because that's not our show

34:32.880 --> 34:34.960
and we'll get into legal hot water,

34:34.960 --> 34:37.360
but you probably should have blocked it.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.200
Like when you saw it coming.

34:39.200 --> 34:42.160
When the shit hits the fan and every day-

34:42.160 --> 34:43.600
Or when the lightsaber hits the face.

34:44.240 --> 34:48.240
Every day in this country is basically gonna be like the purge,

34:48.240 --> 34:50.000
except everyone's got lightsabers.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.480
You're gonna need to know some skills.

34:52.480 --> 34:56.480
You're gonna need to know how to riposte, how to parry, how to face dodge.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.320
All of these techniques are very important

34:58.320 --> 35:01.680
if you want to become a true Jedi Knight, young padawan.

35:01.680 --> 35:05.040
It's me, it's me, Yoda.

35:05.040 --> 35:06.480
I'm going to train you.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.240
It's me, Yoda.

35:08.240 --> 35:13.120
Train you, I will in the ways of my Jedi skills

35:13.120 --> 35:15.040
in the corner of the grand.

35:15.040 --> 35:18.640
Come to the grand ballroom and we shall dance

35:18.640 --> 35:22.800
for that is the first lesson in Jedi sword battles.

35:23.760 --> 35:24.320
Take up your life.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.440
Is that Jared?

35:25.440 --> 35:28.320
He's like a combination of Jared from Labyrinth,

35:28.320 --> 35:30.080
Yoda and Emperor Palpatine.

35:30.080 --> 35:34.000
You remind me of the Jedi, babe.

35:34.000 --> 35:39.120
Young Luke Skywalker in his bassinet and with his sister.

35:39.120 --> 35:42.480
I mean, you don't know about her yet, shit.

35:42.480 --> 35:48.000
Anyway, take up thine sword as I blast you with my space magic.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.640
Are we to assume, by the way, that when Beth says

35:52.640 --> 35:55.520
that Tori is the most beautiful big sister ever,

35:55.520 --> 36:00.000
she means other than the horrific instantly cauterized laser burn

36:00.000 --> 36:01.200
across her face, right?

36:01.200 --> 36:02.240
Other than that, of course.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.440
Well, maybe it's dashing.

36:04.560 --> 36:08.720
Oh, kind of like a roguish charm.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.320
She got that roguish lightsaber.

36:10.320 --> 36:13.280
A roguish third degree laser burn.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.520
I have another message here for Bob Peterson

36:15.520 --> 36:19.760
and it's from AJ Johnson who says, watch your fucking back.

36:19.760 --> 36:24.800
Money well spent, AJ.

36:25.840 --> 36:28.160
Well, maybe this is like AJ.

36:28.160 --> 36:29.920
This is the new black spot.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.840
Imagine my excitement that we finally have a my brother,

36:33.840 --> 36:36.240
my brother and me bit that will be entered into evidence

36:36.240 --> 36:37.360
in a court of law.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.800
That's exciting for me.

36:38.800 --> 36:43.520
There is no way on earth that there that hasn't existed yet.

36:43.520 --> 36:44.640
We've told so many.

36:44.640 --> 36:46.960
I mean, we've been sued hundreds of times,

36:46.960 --> 36:48.240
despite our disclaimer at the beginning

36:48.240 --> 36:49.280
of the television program.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.320
Did I say television?

36:50.320 --> 36:51.920
Cause it's not that it's a podcast.

36:53.280 --> 36:56.320
We got that disclaimer there and we still get sued on the reg.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.520
It's happening every day.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.680
People, it started in episode one.

36:59.680 --> 37:00.960
People were using too much shampoo

37:00.960 --> 37:02.080
and burning their scalp off.

37:03.280 --> 37:04.480
It's just people don't listen.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.320
They don't listen.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.720
They don't listen or they listen too much.

37:08.720 --> 37:09.360
They listen too good.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.400
Or they listen too much.

37:10.400 --> 37:10.960
Yeah.

37:10.960 --> 37:11.840
It's a real problem.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.720
Hey, you like t-shirts, right?

37:15.360 --> 37:16.320

37:36.880 --> 37:40.480
I recently dodged some layoffs at the small town local newspaper.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.800
Now I write and edit articles for a company

37:42.800 --> 37:46.720
that organizes conferences for video games.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.720
Wait, did you dodge them?

37:48.720 --> 37:50.960
Did you dodge them or did you not dodge them?

37:50.960 --> 37:53.520
I dodged them by quitting before they could fire me.

37:53.520 --> 37:54.800
I think that's what they mean.

37:54.800 --> 37:55.300
Yeah.

37:55.840 --> 37:59.360
Okay, so either that or they were the only person not fired

37:59.360 --> 38:01.760
and then went like, oh, cool, cool.

38:01.760 --> 38:02.640
You can't fire me.

38:02.640 --> 38:03.280
I quit.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.600
We weren't like, we weren't going to fire you.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.600
We fired Todd because he was being a dick.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.520
This is not a wave of layoffs.

38:09.520 --> 38:10.160
It's a bullet.

38:10.160 --> 38:10.800
It's a ray.

38:10.800 --> 38:14.400
It's a straight line of layoffs and it pierced through Jerry.

38:14.400 --> 38:15.520
Because he's a dick.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.200
This is clearly a Todd off.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.560
This is not a layoff.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.240
We got a Todd off, folks.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.600
Let's go to the parking lot.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.920
We're going to lay one Todd in the office.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.960
We're going to sell this shit to dance.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.440
So Todd, you just weren't Todd enough.

38:30.640 --> 38:31.920
You just went out Todded.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.040
Out Todd, out Todd, out Todd, survivor.

38:35.040 --> 38:40.960
Todd, you've been voted off.

38:40.960 --> 38:41.840
Wait, which Todd?

38:41.840 --> 38:42.560
Wait, which one?

38:42.560 --> 38:44.960
Sorry, Todd glasses.

38:44.960 --> 38:47.200
Todd, T-A-W-D.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.560
Todd, you're gone.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.680
I out Todded and I out Todded, but I guess I just didn't out Todd.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.120
And that's the one that really matters.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.240
That's the one that you got to know.

38:54.240 --> 38:58.880
Listen, if you're going to win the $600, you got to do the whole trifecta.

38:58.880 --> 39:03.520
You're all, you are the sole Todd Viver.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.480
I recently, okay.

39:06.480 --> 39:10.640
So now I write and edit articles for a company that organizes conferences for video games.

39:11.200 --> 39:16.880
Many of the people in the industry I email use emoticons and emoji liberally.

39:16.880 --> 39:20.880
As a former newsprint copy editor, these confuse and frighten me.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.040
Picture of poopy.

39:23.040 --> 39:24.960
There's this could be a beehive.

39:25.680 --> 39:26.960
What could be a beehive?

39:26.960 --> 39:30.480
Maybe it is a beehive on the floor.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.000
Bees flying around it or might be flies.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.520
Well, you guys use Macs.

39:33.520 --> 39:34.560
I use the PC.

39:34.560 --> 39:36.000
I don't know what your resolution is.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.920
It could be a beehive from where I'm sitting.

39:38.480 --> 39:38.960
Okay.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.000
I think it's poop though.

39:40.720 --> 39:46.640
When should I use emojis and or emoticons in professional emails?

39:46.640 --> 39:53.520
And this is from a picture of a cat in a picture of the American flag or cat in America.

39:53.520 --> 39:57.520
Ah, man, I really want to say never, but I don't feel like that's helpful.

39:57.520 --> 40:01.520
I think it's all just comes down to like using the right emojis.

40:02.080 --> 40:05.200
I feel like you get this more than you let on because in this email you said,

40:05.200 --> 40:06.960
I'm a former newsprint copy editor.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.480
These confuse and frighten me.

40:08.480 --> 40:12.160
And then you took a break from writing the email to go take a huge shit.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.880
And that's why you put in this beehive emoji.

40:16.640 --> 40:21.600
Let me ask you, is this a matter of like level familiarity

40:21.600 --> 40:27.680
or is there a like hierarchy of like if you are someone's boss, you can use emojis.

40:27.680 --> 40:32.000
But if you're if you're like writing to your boss, you can't use emojis.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.120
I don't think you should.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.800
I've never used emojis.

40:35.840 --> 40:36.240
Question.

40:36.240 --> 40:38.320
Do you know how to use emojis?

40:38.320 --> 40:41.200
Do you know how to inject them into your missives?

40:41.200 --> 40:41.920
I don't.

40:41.920 --> 40:44.000
If I'm on the computer, I don't know how to do that.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.360
I know the teens love it on phones.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.720
There's a whole keyboard for them.

40:46.720 --> 40:53.600
I know that because my stupid fat thumb sometimes just brings up like ambulances,

40:53.600 --> 40:56.800
just pictures of ambulances, I guess is why I got to communicate with now.

40:56.800 --> 40:57.840
But you got to look through them.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.920
That's always fra- I wish I could just say like Siri,

40:59.920 --> 41:01.920
ambulance and just put an ambulance there.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.080
I've been stabbed.

41:04.080 --> 41:04.640
Ambulance.

41:05.360 --> 41:13.040
I'm got the command Siri ambulance is probably most effective as a way to make an ambulance emoji.

41:13.040 --> 41:17.040
That is some that is some great prioritization on the Siri AI.

41:17.040 --> 41:18.800
I just like the written word a little too much.

41:18.800 --> 41:23.840
You know, if Dickens can't get the message across, Dickens, Dickens didn't use emojis.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.240
Hemingway didn't actually Hemingway loved emojis.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.600
I don't know if you guys knew that.

41:27.600 --> 41:32.960
Lot a lot of wine bottle emojis going around that lot of bulls then dead bulls.

41:33.760 --> 41:36.560
Yeah, a lot of flaccid penises.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.720
I was trying to think of a more artful way of saying it.

41:38.720 --> 41:40.320
But yes, Travis, flaccid penises.

41:40.320 --> 41:43.200
I mean, there's gaps in the English language that we have to correct sometimes.

41:43.200 --> 41:47.600
Like people from the South get a lot of static for using the word y'all.

41:47.600 --> 41:52.800
But what they're really trying to correct for is a lack of a differentiator in the

41:53.440 --> 41:56.240
plural form of you in the English language.

41:56.240 --> 41:59.760
So y'all was created and then it's a useful word to have.

41:59.760 --> 42:05.040
So I don't I think that emojis can sometimes help to fill a gap.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.840
But what are you communicating with them?

42:07.840 --> 42:13.280
I guess what I'm saying in 2015, what does using an emoji say about you?

42:13.280 --> 42:16.800
I tell you what else it's good for is it's kind of the international language, isn't it?

42:17.360 --> 42:22.400
Like it'll you can use this to speak with anybody anywhere in the world.

42:22.400 --> 42:26.560
And it's good for like the sort of concepts and terminology

42:26.560 --> 42:29.440
that like doesn't exist between two different cultures, right?

42:29.440 --> 42:35.840
Like if there's probably an emoji to sort of express the Japanese idea of being very,

42:35.840 --> 42:38.720
very hungry, but also you've just seen a ghost.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.080
And they have a they have a word for that.

42:42.080 --> 42:44.240
I'm having trouble recalling it.

42:46.320 --> 42:49.840
But we don't we don't have a word for you're very hungry, but you've just seen a ghost.

42:49.840 --> 42:52.880
But then you use the I think the word for is boo mommy.

42:54.240 --> 42:55.440
Jesus, please us.

42:56.560 --> 42:58.400
You made me so angry sometime.

42:58.400 --> 42:59.280
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

43:00.160 --> 43:01.360
Yes, sure.

43:01.360 --> 43:02.560
Let's try this one.

43:02.560 --> 43:04.160
It was sent in by Evan Jones Thorn.

43:04.160 --> 43:04.640
Thank you, Evan.

43:04.640 --> 43:05.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

43:06.400 --> 43:07.360
No name.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.080
Something went wrong.

43:09.120 --> 43:09.620
Gar.

43:10.480 --> 43:11.520
Man, I almost said Garfield.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.520
I feel like I've used that one before for an anonymous one.

43:14.880 --> 43:15.360
Chelsea.

43:16.560 --> 43:17.360
Chelsea asks.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.040
Where is Wizard Hut?

43:23.760 --> 43:25.440
Where is Wizard Hut?

43:25.440 --> 43:31.680
I can't find it and I'm trying to find it on Fantage and I need to find it.

43:31.680 --> 43:32.160
Please.

43:32.160 --> 43:32.880
Where is?

43:32.880 --> 43:34.160
I can't find it.

43:34.160 --> 43:36.240
I can't find it and I'm trying to find it.

43:36.240 --> 43:36.960
Help me, please.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.160
I'm trapped in some kind of hellscape dimension.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.200
Please help.

43:41.200 --> 43:42.320
Where am I?

43:42.320 --> 43:44.240
Oh God, I miss my family.

43:45.440 --> 43:46.880
Where is Wizard Hut?

43:46.880 --> 43:48.400
Where is Wizard Hut?

43:48.960 --> 43:49.840
Wizard Hut.

43:49.840 --> 43:51.440
Is this a thing?

43:54.080 --> 43:54.960
Don't dodge the question.

43:54.960 --> 43:55.920
Where's the Wizard Hut?

43:55.920 --> 43:58.320
Read me the whole question one more time, Griffin.

43:58.320 --> 43:59.600
Where is Wizard Hut?

44:00.240 --> 44:01.440
There's four words.

44:01.440 --> 44:02.880
Uh-huh, but I feel like-

44:02.880 --> 44:03.680
And it's four words.

44:04.480 --> 44:05.760
Here's the core subject.

44:05.760 --> 44:06.800
Where is Wizard Hut?

44:06.800 --> 44:10.240
And then there's like 30 words of a person having a panic attack on the internet.

44:10.960 --> 44:12.000
Where is Wizard Hut?

44:12.000 --> 44:15.600
I feel like Chelsea said some kind of context in the sentence following,

44:15.600 --> 44:16.560
where is Wizard Hut?

44:17.760 --> 44:21.040
They're trying to find it on Fantage, which I don't like that.

44:21.040 --> 44:21.540
Fantage.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.200
Or Fantagé.

44:24.880 --> 44:25.840
Where is the Wizard Hut?

44:25.840 --> 44:27.200
Justin, you're being awfully quiet.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.480
Where are you keeping the Wizard Hut?

44:28.480 --> 44:30.080
Where's the Wizard Hut?

44:30.080 --> 44:32.000
Where's the Wizard Hut, Justin?

44:32.000 --> 44:34.640
Are you now or have you ever been a Wizard Hut?

44:35.440 --> 44:38.960
Anytime you see a Pizza Hut that's not a Pizza Hut anymore,

44:38.960 --> 44:40.080
it has become a Wizard Hut.

44:41.520 --> 44:44.480
They have an arrangement where when a Pizza Hut shuts down,

44:44.480 --> 44:47.680
which I don't think that has ever happened because man, do we love our pizza.

44:48.480 --> 44:51.280
But when one shuts down, they have to sell it to a wizard.

44:51.280 --> 44:54.560
They have actually had a sad string of Pizza Hut shutdowns

44:54.560 --> 45:01.840
in here in Huntington, where your big expansive Pizza Huts,

45:01.840 --> 45:05.200
where you can really go in and stretch your legs and soak in the fucking ambiance

45:05.840 --> 45:09.440
and maybe treat yourself to a lunch buffet if you want to eat to kill.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.880
You can't do that anymore.

45:13.440 --> 45:17.040
They shut down the one on Route 60 and they shut down the one on Fifth Avenue

45:17.040 --> 45:21.760
and they've conglomerated on one that is, I will be honest,

45:21.760 --> 45:25.280
brilliantly located a mere stone's throw,

45:25.280 --> 45:32.000
a mere 30 paces from the Fine Arts Department of Marshall University.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.160
So it's like they are definitely servicing their core demo.

45:36.160 --> 45:37.200
Yeah, I guess so.

45:37.200 --> 45:40.800
So the thing in this way, you guys have a surplus of wizards now.

45:41.520 --> 45:46.720
Don't think of it as every time God closes a Pizza Hut, he opens a Wizard Hut.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.200
That's the way you got to think of it.

45:49.200 --> 45:52.400
What is it about the Pizza Hut sort of building

45:52.400 --> 45:54.560
that makes it so ideal for wizard residents?

45:54.560 --> 45:55.920
It's the tall, pointy hat.

45:56.720 --> 45:57.120
I guess that's a good point.

45:57.120 --> 45:59.040
Yeah, the tall, pointy hat reminds me of their hats.

45:59.040 --> 46:00.880
Also, lots of space for owls.

46:02.400 --> 46:04.640
Also, sometimes they still have a Pac-Man.

46:07.280 --> 46:08.640
Specific to wizards, it's just...

46:09.200 --> 46:09.760
It's nice.

46:10.800 --> 46:14.320
Every Pizza Hut is built on the opening to another dimension.

46:15.440 --> 46:16.800
That's where the flavor comes from.

46:16.800 --> 46:17.360
Yeah, sure.

46:17.360 --> 46:18.560
That's where they summon.

46:19.040 --> 46:22.560
Ooh, Mommy 2, the Daniel sequel experience.

46:23.760 --> 46:26.160
Daniel's next hot jam.

46:26.640 --> 46:27.520
Ooh, Mommy 2.

46:27.520 --> 46:28.480
Ooh, Mommy 2.

46:28.960 --> 46:32.080
I would love to see a sequel to the hit film, Camp Nowhere,

46:32.080 --> 46:33.440
where the kids took over the summer camp

46:33.440 --> 46:35.440
because they lied to all their parents and guardians.

46:35.440 --> 46:37.600
Tell them Christopher Lloyd, they paid to be an adult.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.200
Christopher Lloyd, they paid to be an adult

46:39.200 --> 46:41.280
because that's who you would go to.

46:41.680 --> 46:45.200
We need an adult, but we can't find one just like walking around the street.

46:45.200 --> 46:48.160
Walking around the street, let's hire Christopher Lloyd, professional adult.

46:48.160 --> 46:50.800
Yes, they did hire Christopher Lloyd.

46:50.800 --> 46:51.760
I want that.

46:51.760 --> 46:53.360
But instead of kids taking over summer camp,

46:53.360 --> 46:56.400
they can go over to Pizza Hut and they can do all kinds of...

46:56.400 --> 46:58.240
Well, they would have to snatch it up pretty quickly

46:58.240 --> 47:01.120
to get in there before the wizard starts squatting.

47:01.920 --> 47:05.040
Wizard shows up and goes, I'm pretty sure this is mine now.

47:05.040 --> 47:06.560
No, we got Christopher Lloyd.

47:06.560 --> 47:09.200
Oh, sorry to have bothered you guys.

47:09.200 --> 47:10.960
This is still a Pizza Hut.

47:10.960 --> 47:11.360
Oh, yeah?

47:11.360 --> 47:13.600
Well, it looks like you've turned the Z's backwards

47:13.600 --> 47:15.840
and there's a lot of teen skateboarding in here.

47:16.560 --> 47:19.120
I would like a sequel to the film Heavyweights

47:19.680 --> 47:22.480
where they take over a Pizza Hut

47:22.480 --> 47:24.880
and the opening scene is just like, well, fuck.

47:26.240 --> 47:27.520
Not a closed Pizza Hut.

47:27.520 --> 47:32.560
Right, by takeover you mean they occupy militantly a Pizza Hut.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.200
Form their own sovereign nation.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.720
Just falling through the plate glass window.

47:38.720 --> 47:44.160
No, is it possible that there is a sequel to Camp Nowhere

47:44.160 --> 47:45.360
and it's called Accepted?

47:46.320 --> 47:48.320
Yeah, I mean, that is basically what that is.

47:48.320 --> 47:50.720
It's College Nowhere, Nowhere University.

47:50.720 --> 47:54.160
But listen, that was when we were all caught in Justin Long fever.

47:54.160 --> 47:56.320
We had to get him in as many pictures as we can.

47:56.320 --> 47:59.280
And I'm not complaining, that was a super great time for our nation.

47:59.280 --> 47:59.520
Yeah.

47:59.520 --> 48:02.960
I loved the complete works of Justin Long.

48:02.960 --> 48:05.600
The metanarrative of the Justin Long canon.

48:05.600 --> 48:07.040
It all happens in the same universe.

48:07.040 --> 48:08.320
Not a lot of people know that.

48:08.320 --> 48:10.560
But you can draw a direct line between all of his movies,

48:10.560 --> 48:13.760
starting at Galaxy Quest and ending at Accepted.

48:14.320 --> 48:15.600
Well, starting at Galaxy Quest

48:15.600 --> 48:18.320
and actually ending at Galaxy Quest too, it's a cycle.

48:18.880 --> 48:20.080
It's a circular narrative.

48:20.080 --> 48:22.240
It's weird that after his girlfriend got dragged to hell,

48:22.240 --> 48:24.400
he would feel like getting back on a spaceship, but-

48:24.400 --> 48:25.600
But Jeepers Creepers,

48:25.600 --> 48:27.520
he just wants to get out in the air to space, you know what I mean?

48:27.520 --> 48:30.000
All right, we've completely lost the plot.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.440
Guys, guys, guys, the two of you, listen to me.

48:34.400 --> 48:35.680
Listen, listen to me.

48:35.680 --> 48:38.480
Where is Wizard Hut?

48:38.480 --> 48:40.480
Well, I've just joined Fantage.

48:40.480 --> 48:44.560
I've created my own avatar and let me explore.

48:45.360 --> 48:45.680
Okay.

48:47.280 --> 48:49.680
Live, it's our first Let's Play.

48:49.680 --> 48:50.080
Okay.

48:50.080 --> 48:52.320
It's our new Let's Play series called Let's Dote,

48:52.320 --> 48:55.120
where Travis plays Fantage while we listen.

48:55.120 --> 48:56.240
Oh, they want money.

48:56.240 --> 48:57.840
Okay, I gotta get out of here.

48:59.200 --> 49:01.040
Pull the ripcord, get me out of here.

49:01.040 --> 49:05.360
Travis, I need you to pull the chat channel.

49:05.360 --> 49:06.640
Where is this Wizard Hut?

49:06.640 --> 49:08.080
We gotta, this is a-

49:08.080 --> 49:10.240
Good, but I'm trying, but everything's money.

49:10.240 --> 49:10.960
It's all money.

49:11.920 --> 49:13.280
It's all money all the way down.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.760
Oh God, I can't get out.

49:15.760 --> 49:18.320
I'm stuck in it like the slime in Ghostbusters 2.

49:18.320 --> 49:19.760
Leave me behind, cut the cord.

49:19.760 --> 49:21.280
I don't want to drag you guys in with me.

49:22.000 --> 49:22.880
Goodbye, Travis.

49:22.880 --> 49:23.760
I'll miss Travis.

49:23.760 --> 49:26.880
It's too bad we lost him in the Matrix, the Fantage Matrix.

49:26.880 --> 49:34.080
I am right now, I'm sending a Twitter message to Fantage fans,

49:34.080 --> 49:38.400
the official Twitter channel of Fantage,

49:38.400 --> 49:42.000
to see if I can get a resolution to this.

49:42.880 --> 49:45.920
Where is Wizard Hut, question mark, Huttgate?

49:47.600 --> 49:49.440
President Obama, President Obama,

49:49.440 --> 49:51.200
why aren't you answering the tough question?

49:51.200 --> 49:52.640
I'm now asking POTUS.

49:53.280 --> 49:55.200
When you're not with POTUS, Pat, go to SCOTUS.

49:55.200 --> 49:58.320
Where is Wizard Hut?

49:58.320 --> 50:00.160
SCOTUS, I think you just chill for a bit

50:00.160 --> 50:02.400
because they just changed the whole game.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.160
They're all just playing Fantage.

50:04.160 --> 50:04.960
They're all playing Fantage.

50:04.960 --> 50:08.560
SCOTUS blog, where is Wizard Hut?

50:09.760 --> 50:12.000
Okay, is there anybody else I should ask?

50:12.000 --> 50:12.640
Justin Long.

50:13.280 --> 50:13.520
Yep.

50:14.800 --> 50:16.000
Maybe he knows.

50:16.000 --> 50:16.960
I don't know his Twitter.

50:16.960 --> 50:17.840
Oh, it's Justin Long.

50:18.480 --> 50:20.960
Where is Wizard Hut?

50:20.960 --> 50:22.880
Is there anybody else I could ask?

50:22.880 --> 50:25.200
Do you know, do you guys have anybody who would know

50:25.200 --> 50:26.160
where the Wizard Hut is?

50:26.160 --> 50:28.240
Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

50:28.240 --> 50:29.040
Don't even worry about it.

50:30.640 --> 50:35.280
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

50:35.280 --> 50:37.520
I'll let you guys know if I get any responses.

50:39.760 --> 50:41.360
I'm also gonna look for people asking me

50:41.360 --> 50:45.440
if my account was hacked by the Fantage militia.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.800
Nothing yet, nothing right yet,

50:48.800 --> 50:50.160
but I will keep you guys updated.

50:50.160 --> 50:53.280
And we will stay on the line until we find the answer.

50:54.240 --> 50:58.240
Yes, the first one of those six people to respond to me,

50:59.200 --> 51:02.240
they will, I'll pass that along to you all.

51:02.240 --> 51:05.440
I'm not, I don't think it'll be POTUS first,

51:06.000 --> 51:07.280
but it might be.

51:07.280 --> 51:08.480
I feel like you may have wasted your time

51:08.480 --> 51:10.720
because DippinDots123 responded.

51:10.720 --> 51:11.920
Do you mean Wizard's Domain?

51:11.920 --> 51:13.200
Because if it's Wizard's Domain,

51:13.200 --> 51:14.640
it's in the forest over the bridge.

51:16.400 --> 51:16.800
Really?

51:16.800 --> 51:17.680
Yeah, so.

51:17.680 --> 51:20.160
Who respond, like what tweet did they, to me?

51:20.160 --> 51:21.040
Did they respond to me?

51:21.040 --> 51:22.800
No, no, in the Yahoo answer, this is like the best.

51:22.800 --> 51:23.920
Oh, I was gonna say,

51:23.920 --> 51:25.680
God, I don't wanna get on the fucking radar

51:25.680 --> 51:27.760
of the Fantage legions.

51:28.320 --> 51:29.440
In the forest over the bridge.

51:29.440 --> 51:30.560
God, we could have saved a lot of time

51:30.560 --> 51:31.760
if we just said that right up front.

51:31.760 --> 51:33.920
Man, I wish I just read down a little bit.

51:33.920 --> 51:36.400
Well, this has been another grand waste of time

51:36.400 --> 51:37.280
and we're sorry about it,

51:37.280 --> 51:40.480
but we're not sorry that you chose to spend this hour with us.

51:40.480 --> 51:41.760
It honestly means a lot to us.

51:41.760 --> 51:43.520
So thank you so much for that.

51:43.520 --> 51:44.720
And thank you to MeUndies,

51:45.360 --> 51:47.280

52:09.200 --> 52:11.280
Speaking of great tasting healthy snacks.

52:11.280 --> 52:12.560
Some happy news.

52:13.360 --> 52:15.680
We are having, Jesus, you wanna take it?

52:15.680 --> 52:16.240
You go.

52:16.240 --> 52:17.440
No, well, I don't.

52:17.440 --> 52:20.080
You negotiated the contract fiercely.

52:20.080 --> 52:20.880
I guess I did.

52:21.520 --> 52:26.560
We're doing our first ever sponsored episode

52:26.560 --> 52:28.160
of my brother, my brother and me.

52:31.120 --> 52:32.000
You say sponsored episode,

52:32.000 --> 52:34.960
and people interpret that immediately,

52:34.960 --> 52:35.840
negatively, I feel like.

52:35.840 --> 52:37.520
This is gonna, it's a celebration.

52:38.160 --> 52:42.800
A celebration of cross promotional content.

52:42.800 --> 52:44.800
The synergy is palpable.

52:44.800 --> 52:50.240
Synergy of us connecting with the Totino's brand.

52:50.240 --> 52:53.200
So we're gonna do a bonus episode

52:53.200 --> 52:54.560
of my brother, my brother and me.

52:54.560 --> 52:57.040
You'll get it right here on this fine RSS channel,

52:57.040 --> 52:58.720
wherever fine podcasts are sold,

52:58.720 --> 53:01.120
where we're just gonna talk about Totino's.

53:01.120 --> 53:01.680
Do you need advice?

53:01.680 --> 53:02.720
Do you need Totino's advice?

53:03.520 --> 53:04.480
Either in terms of preparation,

53:04.480 --> 53:06.480
maybe somebody stole your Totino's.

53:06.480 --> 53:09.040
Maybe what's the proper Totino's dish

53:09.040 --> 53:11.200
to be served at various fancy events?

53:11.200 --> 53:12.160
That's a good thing.

53:12.160 --> 53:13.760
Maybe you're sitting Shiva.

53:13.760 --> 53:16.160
What do you prepare for that?

53:16.160 --> 53:16.640
I don't know.

53:16.640 --> 53:17.920
Have you had a great experience

53:17.920 --> 53:20.240
with the Totino's brand that you just wanna share?

53:21.280 --> 53:22.080
You let us know.

53:23.440 --> 53:25.680
It's as much your episode as it is ours.

53:27.040 --> 53:29.520
But it is 100, which is to say zero,

53:29.520 --> 53:31.440
because it's completely owned by Totino's.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.360
It is a Totino's episode.

53:33.360 --> 53:36.000
And do not send us any questions

53:36.000 --> 53:38.800
that are in the region of pizza

53:38.800 --> 53:42.880
without living exclusively in the country of Totino's.

53:42.880 --> 53:46.960
We are only talking about Totino's branded family of products.

53:48.240 --> 53:51.200
Live on the air, I'm gonna take every Totino's product

53:51.200 --> 53:54.000
and combine it into one cannonball of flavor,

53:54.000 --> 53:55.520
and I'm gonna consume all of that

53:55.520 --> 53:57.680
and give it a live review.

53:57.680 --> 53:59.680
It's gonna be a nonstop thrill ride.

53:59.680 --> 54:00.960
So if you send us an email

54:00.960 --> 54:03.440
about making your own pizza from scratch at home,

54:03.440 --> 54:05.280
I will delete your email account remotely.

54:06.320 --> 54:07.040
You're dead.

54:07.040 --> 54:09.360
You're dead to us, pizza-ly speaking.

54:09.360 --> 54:10.320
We want you to tweet,

54:10.320 --> 54:12.960
hashtag MBMBAM Totino's.

54:12.960 --> 54:16.240
You can email us with Totino's in the subject line.

54:16.240 --> 54:20.160
And whatever you do, please follow and tweet at Totino's.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.680
We're also doing some live shows,

54:21.680 --> 54:23.920
bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Seattle,

54:23.920 --> 54:26.800
bit.ly forward slash van MBMBAM.

54:26.800 --> 54:29.040
It's gonna be the last weekend in August.

54:29.040 --> 54:30.480
We're coming to the Pacific Northwest,

54:30.480 --> 54:32.960
and we would love, love, love to see you.

54:32.960 --> 54:34.320
Please come out to those shows

54:35.920 --> 54:37.600
because when you come out to any show,

54:37.600 --> 54:39.760
you're helping us to do more stuff and more shows

54:39.760 --> 54:41.600
and we really appreciate it.

54:41.600 --> 54:43.360
So please go to those two links,

54:43.360 --> 54:44.720
buy tickets to all those shows,

54:45.280 --> 54:46.400
come or don't come.

54:46.400 --> 54:47.440
At that point, I don't care.

54:47.440 --> 54:48.240
No, but please do.

54:49.120 --> 54:50.640
I mean, go ahead and come if you want,

54:50.640 --> 54:52.640
but just the main thing is to definitely buy it.

54:52.640 --> 54:53.140
Oh yeah.

54:54.400 --> 54:56.160
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

54:56.160 --> 54:56.960
for the use of our theme song

54:56.960 --> 54:57.840
and it's a departure off the album,

54:57.840 --> 54:58.640
Putting the Days to Bed.

54:59.280 --> 55:01.120
Everyone owns that album at this point, right?

55:01.120 --> 55:02.240
Like everybody has it

55:02.240 --> 55:04.000
and it's like the best selling number one album

55:04.000 --> 55:06.560
in America and the UK, right?

55:06.560 --> 55:08.800
They distribute it like samples of tide.

55:08.800 --> 55:10.080
Right, like it's gotta be.

55:10.080 --> 55:11.440
Anyway, go get that album, it's great.

55:12.480 --> 55:14.720
I also wanna say I'm so glad it's back.

55:14.720 --> 55:16.480
Justin, been loving the new episodes,

55:16.480 --> 55:17.920
things I bought at Sheets,

55:17.920 --> 55:20.080
the hit video series on YouTube

55:20.080 --> 55:22.080
starring Justin and Dwight Slappy.

55:22.080 --> 55:23.600
So good, so good.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.040
At Sheets with a Z, by the way,

55:25.040 --> 55:26.400
if you're having trouble finding it.

55:26.400 --> 55:27.680
You got some merch now too, right?

55:27.680 --> 55:28.400
I bought a shirt.

55:28.400 --> 55:29.920
It's on its way, I'm very excited about.

55:29.920 --> 55:30.640
Did you really?

55:30.640 --> 55:31.280
Hell yeah, dude.

55:31.840 --> 55:32.400
Thank you.

55:32.400 --> 55:33.360
I really appreciate the support.

55:33.360 --> 55:35.360
I wasn't to support you, I was to support my body.

55:35.360 --> 55:36.640
I'm trying to look good out there.

55:36.640 --> 55:38.960
Yeah, well I appreciate it either way.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.080
Do you wanna plug Travis' show since he just did yours?

55:43.200 --> 55:47.200
Yeah, Trends Like These is a hot new show

55:47.200 --> 55:50.400
about internet trends from Travis McElroy,

55:50.400 --> 55:53.280
my brother, and Brentel Floss, who isn't my brother,

55:53.280 --> 55:54.480
but is a very funny person.

55:54.480 --> 55:56.400
And it's a great show that you will very much enjoy

55:56.400 --> 56:00.640
if you go subscribe to it on iTunes or anywhere else.

56:00.640 --> 56:02.800
And along with all of that other content,

56:02.800 --> 56:03.760
what you really need to do is go to-

56:03.760 --> 56:05.120
Please don't call it content.

56:05.120 --> 56:07.200
You make it sound like a couple brand wizards.

56:08.080 --> 56:10.880
Listen, along with all those brand magics,

56:10.880 --> 56:12.480
you should go listen to all the other shows

56:12.480 --> 56:15.040
on Maximum Fun, they're all great.

56:16.240 --> 56:18.240
I guarantee there is not a show on the network

56:18.240 --> 56:20.560
that I do not listen to that I do not love.

56:20.560 --> 56:22.960
So go listen, go to MaximumFun.org

56:22.960 --> 56:24.320
and check out all the other shows.

56:24.320 --> 56:28.000
Also go check out Brian and Lindsay Will Totally Eat That,

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Maximum Fun's video series, it's excellent.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.080
We've got a bunch of new Max Fun merch,

56:32.080 --> 56:33.520
including Sawbone shirts.

56:33.520 --> 56:35.680
The show that Justin and Sydney do.

56:36.800 --> 56:38.720
It's maxfunstore.com.

56:38.720 --> 56:40.960
There's also tons of My Brother, My Brother,

56:40.960 --> 56:42.640

56:43.200 --> 56:44.480
All right, that's gonna do it for us, Griffin.

56:44.480 --> 56:44.960
Last Yahoo.

56:44.960 --> 56:45.440
Let me hit it.

56:45.440 --> 56:47.040
This one was sent in by Level 9000.

56:47.040 --> 56:48.160
Yadru drew a Drew Davenport.

56:48.160 --> 56:48.560
Thank you, Drew.

56:48.560 --> 56:53.040
It's by YadruAnswersUserButthead, who asks,

56:54.800 --> 56:58.160
would you buy a marble sculpture of Bart Simpson

56:58.160 --> 57:00.080
if money wasn't an issue?

57:00.080 --> 57:04.480
I'm Justin McElroy.

57:05.360 --> 57:06.880
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:06.880 --> 57:08.560
I'm Griffin McElroy.

57:08.560 --> 57:09.600
This has been My Brother, My Brother,

57:09.600 --> 57:11.600
and may kiss your dad's school air on the lips.

57:11.600 --> 57:34.960
I'm Jesse Thorn.

57:34.960 --> 57:36.080
I'm Jordan Morris.

57:36.080 --> 57:38.480
The federal government has millions of dollars

57:38.480 --> 57:40.320
in programs and opportunities

57:40.320 --> 57:42.240
that you need to seize today.

57:42.240 --> 57:43.760
You're a taxpayer, right?

57:43.760 --> 57:45.280
Well, then you've got it coming.

57:45.280 --> 57:46.720
