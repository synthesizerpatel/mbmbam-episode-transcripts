WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:29.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.660 --> 00:50.660
It's better it's better with you

00:53.900 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better with you

01:00.220 --> 01:02.220
Better it's better

01:11.740 --> 01:17.260
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

01:17.260 --> 01:23.940
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your miller's brother Travis big dog wolf wolf for McElroy

01:23.940 --> 01:29.820
And I'm also a new brother and happy to be here Ron funches

01:31.260 --> 01:36.520
Ron funches is our newest brother. That's our new brother Ron funches. We had to get rid of Griffin

01:36.520 --> 01:38.820
They say last in first out, you know what I mean?

01:38.820 --> 01:44.860
Yep, he's the youngest one and we needed some new fresh blood on the show. So we brought our dear friend Ron funches

01:44.860 --> 01:49.660
Yeah, it's what some will play it called a studio reboot. Yep

01:50.540 --> 01:52.540
family, yeah

01:52.780 --> 01:56.420
We started with the family first like Ron has been in

01:56.840 --> 02:02.180
Inserted into our family for a guy. It's been a few months now Ron where we brought you into

02:02.860 --> 02:04.860
Have dinner with us

02:05.060 --> 02:09.580
All the usual salads. Yeah, Christmas exchanges all the usual

02:09.580 --> 02:15.540
And now only now that we've perfected the at home those rhythms that it took us decades to perfect with Griffin

02:15.900 --> 02:22.860
Now we're ready for to make a podcast together. That's exciting. Well, it's fun. It really didn't take that long with me

02:23.380 --> 02:26.540
Yeah, I mean he must have been you know, not that

02:27.420 --> 02:31.020
Enjoyable to take decades to get that repertoire that only took us weeks

02:31.500 --> 02:35.140
Yeah, I wasn't gonna say it Ron, but that is accurate

02:35.140 --> 02:40.260
You know what? I mean, I just feel like I feel like you're more our brother now than Griffin ever was Wow

02:40.460 --> 02:45.140
Yeah, I mean I didn't want I mean I do want to say it because I felt it

02:46.540 --> 02:48.540
Yeah

02:50.100 --> 02:55.660
More like our brother that Griffin ever has or ever will yep, I agree

02:57.500 --> 03:00.380
This is this is so this is very exciting

03:00.380 --> 03:07.620
Because Ron also has a thrilling. I mean, you know Ron from everything most importantly like us

03:07.780 --> 03:11.660
He was a star of trolls and trolls world tour

03:11.660 --> 03:18.060
We were only in the second one, but uh, you know Ron's done that with us and Ron does they couldn't afford you for the first?

03:18.060 --> 03:19.580
That's right

03:19.580 --> 03:21.180
project

03:21.180 --> 03:23.860
Ron is the stand-up Ron does a

03:23.860 --> 03:31.260
Podcast and Rhonda's streaming on streaming on Twitch Ron does everything but right now I want to talk about

03:31.700 --> 03:35.900
I'm so excited for chop 420 on discovery plus

03:36.820 --> 03:42.860
Launching I guess as the crow flies tomorrow if you're listening this launch day, why wouldn't you?

03:44.100 --> 03:49.380
Can we just can I just can you just tell me what it's like? How is it wrong? It is as if

03:49.380 --> 03:55.940
At some point I just have to go like am I dead is this a thing where

03:56.740 --> 03:58.740
I'm just living in my brain

03:58.860 --> 04:06.900
you know like a matrix style thing of a future that I created that I would have wanted where they feed me delicious foods of

04:07.100 --> 04:09.100
ducks and

04:09.660 --> 04:16.060
Extravagant items and then they're also infused with marijuana and I get to host the show and I had to sign a contract

04:16.060 --> 04:23.460
That said are you okay with smoking marijuana on camera, which most of my contracts say, please don't smoke marijuana

04:27.300 --> 04:32.900
How do you like keep a balance like how do you do have you did you like at any point did you have to like

04:32.900 --> 04:36.440
Pull aside a producer be like just a quick update. I'm getting too high

04:38.580 --> 04:40.580
We're still making a TV show, right

04:40.580 --> 04:47.560
I have a pretty good tolerance. So it never really came up and also I like to be professional

04:48.140 --> 04:54.100
So, you know, I didn't I have to eat that much and I just had to smoke on occasion

04:54.100 --> 04:59.740
So I just tried to host and have fun and then smoke after or smoke whenever was appropriate

04:59.740 --> 05:05.820
But you know, it never it never became an issue for me. I could have done more for person now Ron

05:05.820 --> 05:12.740
What's it like having a high tolerance with marijuana because if I hear but somebody like just hearing you talk about it

05:12.740 --> 05:16.900
Now is making me feel like my organs are moving around inside my body

05:19.860 --> 05:22.860
It's nice and also there's pluses and negatives

05:22.860 --> 05:27.420
I think having a low tolerance is fun because then it doesn't take much at all

05:27.900 --> 05:29.900
You're happy anything exactly

05:29.900 --> 05:37.660
Exactly, but then having a high tolerance could be fun because you learn to appreciate the different flavors the different notes of things and

05:38.140 --> 05:44.380
Can be fun like people who you know people who love wine a lot are just alcoholics, but

05:45.860 --> 05:53.940
Still have fun with it, you know Ron, I'm really excited that we got you here because this gives us a chance to sort of

05:53.940 --> 06:01.020
Shepard the next generation of TV stars because as you know, this everyone knows we had

06:02.380 --> 06:07.900
Kind of a huge hit series called my brother my brother me on the CISO streaming network

06:08.220 --> 06:13.300
And now I sort of I'm so excited to pass on sort of our expertise

06:13.980 --> 06:16.220
that we gained from those six episodes of

06:17.180 --> 06:18.220
television

06:18.220 --> 06:24.900
The number one thing if I may Justin yeah, please if you need to go potty during filming you say ten one

06:24.900 --> 06:27.260
And it means you have to go pee and ten two

06:27.500 --> 06:34.500
Means you need to make a dookie and you say those things and it confuses the crew so they can't judge you for

06:35.740 --> 06:41.900
Releasing your your bodily stuff. So that's just something you need to know. I thought that might be some more sound guy made up

06:41.900 --> 06:47.980
Especially the part where you have to delineate what you'll be doing the bathroom

06:47.980 --> 06:53.120
I can't imagine why the sound guy needs to know that I will say the other day I when I was doing the live stream

06:53.380 --> 06:59.140
escape room all of a sudden Neil Patrick Harris sprung up from his chair and yelled 10-1 and

07:04.860 --> 07:10.060
There's no editing now Ron how many episodes are can we expect the first batch from

07:10.060 --> 07:15.180
From chop 420. Well, you can expect five episodes to drop on

07:15.940 --> 07:19.740
420 on discovery plus gives you a chance to binge them all

07:19.900 --> 07:27.540
give us a chance to hopefully get people to rewatch them and and I would love to just get right back to making a new batch because

07:27.540 --> 07:28.380
I

07:28.380 --> 07:32.540
It's my favorite job. I've ever had I'm really good at it. I think

07:32.540 --> 07:42.540
I'd like to keep doing it. It's just I mean that it's so fun to me because it's

07:42.940 --> 07:48.040
It's like kind of a perfect mix of what I try to do. It's got the the chopped franchise

07:48.040 --> 07:53.700
Which is the tent pole the cooking community is in the background of everyone's home

07:53.700 --> 07:59.580
And then you add marijuana in me. It's fun. It's gonna be so fun

07:59.580 --> 08:04.640
I just want people give it a chance you have the parts normally the hosts on these will like

08:05.140 --> 08:09.940
Snatch a bite of the food, even though they're not judging. They'll like get a bite, right?

08:09.940 --> 08:16.120
Does it is that the way does I feel like that'd be so much pressure because I I like most stuff that I

08:16.420 --> 08:20.460
You know me like I like most things so I feel like I would be the one who's like, man

08:20.460 --> 08:25.660
I don't know seems good to me. I yeah seems good. It's all warm all the way through and stuff. It's got salt

08:25.660 --> 08:31.660
I love it. And then the judges would be like you uncultured buffoon. Yeah, that's pretty much what happened. Yeah

08:37.780 --> 08:39.780
My anxieties are just yeah

08:40.540 --> 08:46.340
That's what it was like to host it. But that's I felt okay with that cuz you know, I felt if people

08:47.260 --> 08:50.540
Already cuz you know you get the like there's been other like pot

08:50.540 --> 08:55.220
of cooking shows they're all like real laid-back and stuff and I think this one, you know

08:55.220 --> 08:59.500
People were really going for that $10,000 is a lot of these chefs

08:59.860 --> 09:04.140
Hadn't worked that much recently because the pandemic of course, you know

09:04.140 --> 09:10.780
And so I was like, oh I can kind of like there's other people's jobs that tear apart their dishes or whatever

09:10.780 --> 09:12.780
like I think it's my job to kind of just

09:13.060 --> 09:20.040
Let everybody shine and you know and kind of cheerlead for everybody and support all the people and and I'm

09:20.040 --> 09:25.500
Good at that. So that's kind of what became my role in the whole show now

09:25.500 --> 09:28.320
Was there was there ever a moment and I know you can't give spoilers wrong

09:28.320 --> 09:34.940
But was there ever a moment where somebody finished their dish and realized they'd forgot to put marijuana in it and just kind of sprinkled

09:34.940 --> 09:36.940
it on top

09:44.520 --> 09:46.520
That's what I would do

09:46.520 --> 09:54.100
All right, let's get into like let's I mean I want to help people yeah, especially we have something actually knows they're talking about for a change

09:55.720 --> 09:59.940
Let's go my friend and I have been talking a lot in the past several conversations

09:59.940 --> 10:03.760
We have had she has mentioned a hat that I knitted for her

10:03.920 --> 10:08.200
She had thanked me many times for it and made comments about how much she likes it

10:08.200 --> 10:12.200
I had no memory of ever giving her a hat, but I do knit

10:12.200 --> 10:16.240
So I assume I gave it to her a long time ago and it has slipped my mind

10:16.820 --> 10:21.200
For this reason I've mostly just given a vague you're welcome anytime

10:21.780 --> 10:26.800
Recently, I was at her house and she pointed out the very well-made hat to me brothers. I did not make this hat

10:27.860 --> 10:30.460
Shit brothers and Ron Funches. I did not make this hat

10:30.740 --> 10:35.240
She has now asked me a couple times whether she can pay me to make another one like it

10:35.240 --> 10:39.340
Do I agree to make her another hat under the guise of being the original has creator?

10:39.340 --> 10:45.100
Do I come clean and face questioning about why I pretended to remember making the hat?

10:45.660 --> 10:48.220
That's from knitting confusion in North Carolina

10:49.180 --> 10:51.180
You should have told the truth the first time

10:51.180 --> 10:56.540
I don't know how many times we have to tell people this but I feel like if you lie one time

10:56.980 --> 11:00.020
That's kind of you've made that decision. I don't know

11:00.020 --> 11:03.900
I know I just had to commit to the lie now. You've got to commit now

11:03.900 --> 11:10.020
You've made a prison of lies and you're living it. This feels like a different scenario though because they didn't lie. Someone said

11:10.020 --> 11:15.380
Did you make that hat and they thought I've made a lot of hats. I don't remember it but probably yeah

11:15.420 --> 11:21.440
Yeah, sure. Like I don't know. I think that that was just more of like, you know, you assumed you made the hat

11:21.460 --> 11:27.740
No, no, she pointed the hat out. Did you remember the part from the now friend pointed the hat out to you at their house?

11:27.880 --> 11:32.860
But that was after they had already said that they made it that was after the assumption

11:32.860 --> 11:38.940
That well, that's called what it is. You're not wrong the lie, but it was kind of an accidental lie. No, no, no

11:39.620 --> 11:44.060
Can I point out one thing, please? And I'm not a judge. I'm very

11:44.780 --> 11:48.620
Sex positive in all things, but this person sounds like a bit of a hat floozy

11:49.220 --> 11:51.220
Okay. Yeah

11:51.540 --> 11:53.540
random hats from

11:53.540 --> 11:56.820
Whoever to the point that they don't know what they got to have from

11:56.820 --> 12:02.020
That's a good point there how many hats is this person getting yeah

12:03.980 --> 12:05.980
You want out there but don't

12:07.740 --> 12:11.580
Don't then turn around and then make other people feel bad about it

12:11.580 --> 12:15.960
I feel like maybe yeah, you go ahead and say I will make you another hat

12:15.960 --> 12:22.340
And but it doesn't have to be like that hat you just go look each one is a piece of art that I've made

12:22.340 --> 12:27.460
That was the mood. I was in for the previous hat and now you get this other style hat

12:27.460 --> 12:32.980
I bet you they don't they won't say anything. I'm not the me I was when I made that hat. Mm-hmm

12:34.060 --> 12:38.660
Right, that's not a lie, right? You're not you're not the person who made that

12:41.300 --> 12:43.300
It's actually pretty good

12:44.180 --> 12:51.060
You know what we said that once you live one time but Travis kind of inadvertently made a decent point in that

12:51.060 --> 12:52.060
um

12:52.060 --> 12:55.700
You did have a one off ramp you had a chance

12:55.860 --> 13:00.700
You had one chance when you saw the hat to be like, oh, okay

13:00.700 --> 13:06.620
This is I'm sorry. I was confused about a different hat. This is not my work

13:06.620 --> 13:12.780
I think there's a miscommunication, but you didn't do that and that was the last chance you didn't do that

13:12.780 --> 13:19.380
Yeah, you have to live with this. You cannot go back. It's too wild. Yeah, that was when the mistake was made

13:19.380 --> 13:24.820
The only out now is to truly just like borrow that half

13:24.820 --> 13:29.780
I go like I'm gonna need this hat to recreate it and then you just have to spend your life

13:30.860 --> 13:33.100
Trying to recreate that hat perfectly

13:33.980 --> 13:37.780
Yeah, yeah, I mean I didn't want to say it but I think that's your option

13:38.340 --> 13:44.860
You could also just stop talking to this person. Yeah, that's that's cut him out of your life. Yeah, that's always the option

13:44.860 --> 13:49.380
I think that weren't so many times. I have would you guys like a Yahoo answer?

13:49.380 --> 13:53.980
Oh, man, it's still a little fresh the wounds still a little fresh because it is

13:54.620 --> 13:56.500
dying on

13:56.500 --> 14:00.060
Well, I mean the last day to submit questions is tomorrow

14:00.740 --> 14:06.060
But yeah, Trav. Yeah, I guess I guess I guess I guess so. Yeah. Okay. I'm filling in for Griffin here

14:06.900 --> 14:09.620
So it's weird. This is uncharted territory for me. But here we go

14:09.620 --> 14:14.740
This was sent in by Ben Kent. I believe the Wizards been can't if I remember correctly

14:15.260 --> 14:22.300
It's asked by an anonymous Yahoo answers user who I'm going to call Griffin McElroy and Griffin McElroy asks

14:22.700 --> 14:27.580
Do you think frogs even like eating bugs or is it just their nature instinct? I

14:28.500 --> 14:33.620
like this question because it does posit the idea of like a frog like eating a bug like oh

14:34.300 --> 14:36.300
I wish I could eat

14:36.300 --> 14:38.060
Oh

14:38.060 --> 14:40.060
Gross

14:40.420 --> 14:45.020
Yeah, I mean I guess bugs are just I think it is probably instinctual well

14:46.180 --> 14:51.260
Would you have to be taught where but your bet your parents probably have to teach you which ones are bugs, right?

14:51.820 --> 14:57.060
Crogues I think apples are like very large stationary bugs, you know or

14:57.780 --> 15:02.980
Cars are like gigantic metal bugs that you can eat like your parents have to teach you bug from not bug

15:02.980 --> 15:04.100
I would assume

15:04.100 --> 15:07.180
Well, do you think after a while like you you eat bugs for a while?

15:07.180 --> 15:12.860
And then you see like a human being like having a hamburger and you're like wait, hold on. What the fuck is that?

15:13.280 --> 15:18.300
No, no, I don't you don't think that happens. I don't think so. No, it's so big

15:18.300 --> 15:25.260
You know, I think her to you you're out there. There's a lot of options. There's other things the tap hole

15:25.260 --> 15:27.500
Oh, I guess you wouldn't use a tadpole. Oh god. No

15:27.500 --> 15:32.540
Oh, that'd be ghoulish get yourself kicked out. Yeah kicked out of your frog family

15:32.540 --> 15:38.020
I like to see what happens with that one and to tell you the truth, but I feel like you you love the bug

15:38.020 --> 15:43.620
There's other options you could be having and you're choosing the bugs. I mean, I like crab

15:43.620 --> 15:48.060
Well crabs was bugs of the sea, you know who we who we?

15:48.980 --> 15:53.260
Who are we to judge frogs? No, I was just asking who we were just

15:53.260 --> 15:59.620
Oh, oh Ron, um, we're the McElroy brothers. Yeah, you us three. Oh, yes

16:03.300 --> 16:06.740
I mean like I feel like nature's part of it, but there's definitely some trial and error

16:07.420 --> 16:12.540
Right. I mean you're definitely gonna eat something. It's not a bug and it turns out it was a pop cap. It's like oh, man

16:12.540 --> 16:18.180
Yeah, I don't want that and also I feel like they eat certain bugs right not every bug passes the test

16:18.420 --> 16:20.420
There's some type of palette involved

16:20.420 --> 16:27.040
You gotta like some bugs more than other bugs, I guess well, I mean Timon and Pumbaa did teach us that like one

16:27.540 --> 16:35.180
Bugs are delicious. But two there's got to be bugs that frogs are like, oh shit. Yeah that bug. That's the best bug

16:35.360 --> 16:42.340
We'd love eating those bugs those bugs though. Those are the bad tasting bugs. We don't like those bugs

16:44.100 --> 16:46.100
Probably

16:47.260 --> 16:49.020
Yeah science

16:49.020 --> 16:54.100
Here's another question while in a car with my new co-workers. I was offered a piece of hard candy

16:54.100 --> 16:56.100
I had never tried before I

16:56.820 --> 17:00.460
Gratefully accepted and I was enjoying the candy when I realized it was chewable

17:02.020 --> 17:07.760
Now I'm sitting in the back seat trying desperately to figure out if this is supposed to be gum or something to be eaten

17:07.780 --> 17:13.220
I've been setting the way my co-workers are moving their jaws and I still don't know what this candy is

17:13.220 --> 17:17.500
What should I do? I really don't want to embarrass myself in front of my new friends

17:17.500 --> 17:24.740
That's her full mix of Florida. Wow. Well, first of all, they probably been holding on to this for a long time now. Yeah

17:25.380 --> 17:28.660
Yeah, there's no way we've got to this person in time to help

17:29.620 --> 17:33.540
Gotta be stale by now or the mouth. They're just really chewing.

17:34.500 --> 17:41.340
I enjoy that the person this question asker did not tell us what candy this is. They don't know. They don't know

17:41.340 --> 17:44.380
It's a new experience to them. They don't even okay, okay

17:44.380 --> 17:48.500
Which is the thing that I like about them first of all that they were open to new candies

17:48.500 --> 17:50.500
I like that as a person to me that tells me

17:51.140 --> 17:58.860
That you've already found friends that are gonna like you and enjoy you that that you were open and willing to try a new candy

17:58.980 --> 18:03.300
Experience you never had before. I'm gonna even if it's new to you

18:03.300 --> 18:09.840
I refuse to believe you got a friend up in the front. They're like, hey, do you want candy? Do you want a candy?

18:09.840 --> 18:13.120
Yeah, hey everybody. I'm gonna enjoy a candy

18:13.120 --> 18:20.920
I feel like to enjoy a candy with me. No one would say it that way you serial killer. They would say a piece of candy

18:22.000 --> 18:24.880
That's so dumb to script. I couldn't answer that

18:25.240 --> 18:30.400
How do I know if I what if you got good and plenty's up there and I'm gonna subject myself to that

18:30.400 --> 18:35.000
Come on now, first of all good and plenty's are fine. Disrespect. Thank you so much

18:35.000 --> 18:39.400
Oh, thank you my brother back you

18:40.000 --> 18:45.720
Understand if you've had the most majority of good and plenty's are stale and inedible bricks

18:45.720 --> 18:51.380
But if you just happen to have a lucky day, you'll find it a fresh batch of good and plenty's

18:51.920 --> 18:56.640
It'll change your opinion. Really Ron. I just can't I can't get on board with it

18:56.640 --> 18:59.320
Maybe it's like, you know, it's been a long time since I've tried him

18:59.320 --> 19:06.060
I'm older now and I've learned a lot about the wrong person's candy. That's a dope candy

19:06.680 --> 19:08.680
You need a mature

19:09.000 --> 19:11.240
Palate to enjoy a good and plenty

19:11.240 --> 19:14.760
I also I think I have a soft spot in my heart for good and plenty

19:14.960 --> 19:19.800
Because they basically the name of them like there's fine. They're fine. There's a lot of them

19:20.120 --> 19:25.240
Like the claim to fame is they're okay, and there's more than you expect

19:25.240 --> 19:30.480
It was just true they feel it to the brim. Yeah, they know what they are

19:30.480 --> 19:33.840
You know, they're not called like excellent and plenty. They're good

19:34.960 --> 19:37.520
Okay, but you have okay, but what?

19:38.600 --> 19:44.880
What you have said it has a grain of truth. Not the good part, but the plenty part is interesting because

19:46.160 --> 19:48.720
most snack or junk type foods

19:48.720 --> 19:56.720
Market themselves on their crave ability. Yep, like if you think about Pringles like once you popped off the fun

19:56.720 --> 19:59.360
Don't stop lace potato chips bet you can't eat just one

19:59.480 --> 20:04.800
Right what good and plenty has the gust to say is you will get to a point where you're like, I've had plenty of these

20:04.800 --> 20:06.800
Yeah

20:08.440 --> 20:12.680
One serving in here this is fine. Yeah, this is good

20:12.680 --> 20:15.480
I'm at a good level with these

20:16.120 --> 20:22.660
Yeah, we just need something to chew on yeah good and plenty is there for yeah, I mean you're not wrong

20:22.680 --> 20:27.080
It's it's a fair point. What was the question? Oh, I don't just swallow it

20:29.080 --> 20:34.160
I mean you're gonna swallow it one way or the other might as well swallow it right now just swallow it

20:34.160 --> 20:34.480
Yeah

20:34.480 --> 20:40.160
And if it started off as a hard candy that got chewable odds are it's a candy not a gum

20:40.160 --> 20:43.820
Like I don't know many gums that start off that way unless you're like

20:44.480 --> 20:49.520
Even the hardest of the icebreakers, you know aren't like a hard candy

20:49.520 --> 20:52.400
I think it must be a candy with a gooey

20:52.680 --> 20:57.160
Chewy metal in the same family of a good and plenty or now

20:58.160 --> 21:04.920
Eminem's I have been tricked by a mentos before because a mentos it's original right is

21:05.600 --> 21:09.280
Seems so much like gum and it's not and then there's mentos gum

21:09.280 --> 21:12.620
Which is almost exactly the same as mentos

21:13.320 --> 21:19.920
Except it's gum. It's it's it's really fucking with me guys. I think you figured out what it was

21:19.920 --> 21:26.000
I think it must be a mentos. It's gotta be right. It's confusing shit. Oh, I

21:26.880 --> 21:32.640
Guess I mean, I guess it's possible anything's possible in this world, but I don't know you just got a dream

21:32.640 --> 21:34.640
I guess you just swallow it

21:34.640 --> 21:40.120
Um, that's actually where I'm gonna come down no matter what it is. And and I think that you're I think you can later

21:40.120 --> 21:44.920
Be like that candy was great. What was that? Oh, maybe can you stash it?

21:45.160 --> 21:50.960
Can you kind of park it like you're supposed to do nicotine gum just like park it behind your lower lip and just be like

21:50.960 --> 21:55.080
Oh, that was great. I've finished it. I've either spit it out or swallowed it

21:55.080 --> 22:01.920
I finished mine. I'm done. What was that again?

22:01.920 --> 22:08.000
I want to buy more later so I can either swallow more or spit out more pieces of it. Yes first. I'm done

22:08.640 --> 22:10.800
My candy experience is complete

22:12.560 --> 22:17.080
This is why cars should never have gotten rid of ashtrays in the door handles

22:17.480 --> 22:23.320
Cuz that's what you could have hidden this but not now there's not a good receptacle for this in cars these days

22:23.320 --> 22:27.120
Bring back car ashtrays. You guys remember those? Yeah

22:28.840 --> 22:30.840
Lincoln Continental

22:34.360 --> 22:36.360
Realize we were dealing with the royalty

22:38.240 --> 22:45.000
I work in an engineering company and my co-worker Kyle has been acting strange lately with others and myself

22:45.480 --> 22:50.680
He pins blame on other people and out outright avoids projects with with problems

22:50.680 --> 22:57.480
But he's fine with with me for some reason. I have no quarrel with him and relatively just chill with others

22:57.880 --> 23:02.160
We're going out to a brew house tonight with everyone in the department invited

23:02.880 --> 23:04.880
Should I invite Kyle?

23:04.920 --> 23:08.840
That's her anti-social engineer in York. Oof

23:11.240 --> 23:13.240
Kyle on the outs

23:13.960 --> 23:15.960
poor Kyle

23:16.080 --> 23:18.600
Hmm. He seemed like he's making this problem

23:18.600 --> 23:24.080
Here's the thing though. Kyle seems fine with the question asker for some reason

23:24.080 --> 23:26.080
Yeah, I don't know that I don't want to throw that away

23:27.600 --> 23:29.600
You don't want to get on Kyle's bad side

23:30.880 --> 23:34.400
Mmm, that's true. Cuz that way if you can play both

23:35.120 --> 23:38.600
You get the full scope of the office, right? Yeah

23:39.720 --> 23:46.960
You get the anti Kyle people tell you things and then you can tell the Kyle telling you his crazy side

23:46.960 --> 23:48.760
your little Kyle birds

23:48.760 --> 23:54.360
Your little Kyle birds telling you all your secrets. I want to keep a Kyle on my side

23:54.360 --> 23:57.240
Yeah, I don't think I want to ostracize Kyle

23:57.800 --> 24:03.960
Especially you might be all that Kyle has and that's gonna be hurtful. I think that's more important to foster that relationship

24:04.360 --> 24:07.600
With Kyle cuz he really depends on you

24:07.600 --> 24:10.780
Yeah, I think you can just sort of toss it by the wayside, you know

24:10.780 --> 24:12.960
You might be able to bring Kyle back to the fold

24:12.960 --> 24:19.480
You know what I mean? You might be able to reach out and help Kyle exactly because it says he's been acting strange lately

24:19.840 --> 24:21.840
Kyle wasn't always like this

24:22.440 --> 24:27.320
Mmm, something's happened to Kyle something's going on with Kyle and Kyle's Kyle

24:28.080 --> 24:34.560
Divided against himself cannot stand you guys. Oh, wow. You gotta build Kyle up not tear Kyle down

24:35.040 --> 24:39.080
Yes behind every powerful Kyle. There's a good friend

24:39.080 --> 24:47.400
It's maybe time to invent something that happened with Kyle that you can tell everybody else that they'll be nicer to Kyle

24:47.400 --> 24:49.800
Is that like Kyle's been going through a hard time lately?

24:49.800 --> 24:54.360
I what kind of hard time you can say heartbreak and heartbreak is so

24:54.920 --> 25:01.300
Versatile it really is because people might assume romance, but you can have your heart broken about a lot of things, you know

25:01.600 --> 25:03.600
Yeah, heartbreak can come from anywhere

25:03.600 --> 25:10.280
Welcome to our comedy podcast. Well anything can make you sad my friend

25:12.240 --> 25:16.100
Ron you've probably had pretend jobs for about as long as we've had pretend jobs

25:16.520 --> 25:23.560
Do you find it hard to reconnect to questions like this and remember what it was like to to have like?

25:23.560 --> 25:33.040
co-workers that that you needed to navigate on a daily basis instead of just sort of like transient relationships with the

25:33.440 --> 25:36.120
With the ebb and flow of the entertainment industry

25:40.880 --> 25:42.880
Yeah, I can still remember

25:43.160 --> 25:49.720
No, because I've always used it as motivation. I can still like hear a bank call center

25:49.720 --> 25:54.600
a phone calls going off in the back of my head so I can still

25:55.400 --> 25:58.120
Remember it, but that's also what makes me feel like yeah

25:58.800 --> 26:00.960
This is a make-or-break deal, right?

26:00.960 --> 26:06.160
Cuz Kyle's gonna find out about this party no matter what no one no matter what that Ron makes a great point

26:06.160 --> 26:13.000
It is 100% assured Kyle will find out about the party, especially if people don't like Kyle. They will tell Kyle

26:13.000 --> 26:17.760
Oh, I didn't see you there. What were you Kyle? They will tell Kyle. Mm-hmm

26:17.760 --> 26:21.720
I say bring Kyle what's the worst that could happen with him just coming out?

26:21.720 --> 26:28.160
Oh, he blames other people and he avoids work. That sounds like a cool guy in regular life to me

26:28.360 --> 26:34.040
Yeah, you're outside company hours you leave the company stuff at home at five o'clock

26:34.120 --> 26:39.960
You're like, let's go just hang as regular people and what's going on the day work doesn't matter anymore

26:40.620 --> 26:44.120
Unless it's your company then that's the part in it's the problem

26:44.120 --> 26:50.320
Hey Ron that actually reminds me to ask you does the cast of trolls ever get together and hang out?

26:50.320 --> 26:55.520
Cuz we haven't been getting those invites if that's the case. Yeah, that's been happening

26:55.520 --> 26:59.920
We haven't been on that list. Like are you and Anna Kendrick hanging out a lot? I

27:00.680 --> 27:04.520
Didn't know that I mean, I thought you I just thought you guys were busy. Oh

27:06.000 --> 27:07.360
Okay

27:07.360 --> 27:12.840
Okay, so the same rock what they told me every time, you know at the at the crew on the cruise

27:12.840 --> 27:14.840
There's a cruise

27:15.600 --> 27:17.600
Last year

27:20.640 --> 27:22.640
You know Ron we were supposed to

27:23.200 --> 27:27.600
This is gonna be hard for you to hear but we were supposed to go to the premiere of the movie

27:27.600 --> 27:30.560
Yeah, now they did explicitly tell us we couldn't bring anybody

27:33.920 --> 27:35.920
And they wouldn't pay for our flights

27:35.920 --> 27:42.800
But we were somewhat invited they would permit our fucking human meat

27:43.800 --> 27:50.560
This space with the other people where we would be within like I'll probably not we would probably be in the overflow party

27:50.560 --> 27:54.120
Where you're seeing Justin Timberlake on a jumbotron? Yeah run through five minutes

27:54.800 --> 27:55.960
but um

27:55.960 --> 27:57.960
the and really the greatest hole covered

27:58.040 --> 28:01.520
It but we that got that didn't happen because they didn't do that

28:01.520 --> 28:04.040
So we didn't get to go to that and that was probably like our one big

28:04.040 --> 28:06.880
I feel like our one big shot. That was our chance

28:06.880 --> 28:11.960
I was sad about that too because my mom was sad cuz she wanted to meet Mary J

28:11.960 --> 28:14.320
Blige and I wanted to meet George Clinton

28:14.320 --> 28:17.800
So I also understand sad and if it makes you feel better

28:17.800 --> 28:21.600
I like, you know that I shot something just yesterday that

28:22.080 --> 28:27.520
The assistant director wanted to let me know that well because I was coming in at the time

28:27.520 --> 28:35.280
I did I technically wasn't supposed to have lunch if I wanted if I was really hungry to find a way to get

28:48.320 --> 28:52.000
What's great about that no I have to know stop don't move forward rod

28:52.000 --> 28:58.320
I have to know what your response was were you hungry enough where you're like, see what you can scrounge? No

28:58.320 --> 29:04.480
I was actually at that point very very thankful that my wife had packed me a protein shake so that I could just go

29:04.480 --> 29:06.480
No, I'm fine. I

29:07.620 --> 29:13.480
Don't need your pity BLT. Yeah, I don't need you. Yeah, exactly. Oh, thank you

29:16.000 --> 29:18.960
It's wild that the strap the different like

29:18.960 --> 29:22.800
Strata of that, you know, I'll tell you a wild thing. You probably seen stuff like this

29:22.800 --> 29:27.040
But we did our I don't know if you heard but we did six episodes of a streaming TV show

29:27.040 --> 29:31.340
And it was on season network. Yeah, I was on the season network and we shot it and well

29:31.340 --> 29:36.480
What what the heck travel do we shoot that in 2016? Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so we shot that in 2016

29:37.280 --> 29:39.680
the the craft services table

29:39.680 --> 29:43.880
which if you don't know some of the lingo going in is where they put like food and drinks and

29:44.200 --> 29:48.440
We had a micro micro budget for this show. So there wasn't really money for that

29:48.440 --> 29:53.240
there was mainly like old cell phone containers of people's food that they didn't take for lunch and

29:53.600 --> 30:00.360
Like I think a few granola bars. Yeah, and then when they did the promo photos for it

30:00.960 --> 30:08.600
They they had a photographer fly in and it and the photographer in the photography area had the most lavish

30:09.280 --> 30:12.800
Spread of snacks and treats I've ever seen in my entire life

30:12.800 --> 30:18.040
I like it was like it was like a stepparent trying to impress the kid like

30:19.240 --> 30:21.240
Don't give me a dog

30:21.440 --> 30:27.640
Every day to be photo day. This is amazing. Look at this guy's this is fantastic. Oh, I've been on a couple see-so shoots

30:27.640 --> 30:29.640
I knew that the Trader Joe's

30:30.040 --> 30:33.880
crafty that they had there a couple protein bars and

30:34.480 --> 30:36.480
some crystal geyser waters

30:36.480 --> 30:43.880
You see we shot honey to West Virginians, so we should we could we were murdered for Trader Joe's

30:45.880 --> 30:51.680
I noticed that every this is getting more specific, but I think why not we're all here. We're all friends here

30:51.680 --> 30:56.800
I've found that most in the very few instances and it has been obviously quite a while

30:57.440 --> 31:04.360
In very few instances. I've been near craft services table one common mainstay is a big jug of trail mix

31:04.360 --> 31:12.000
yep, and I think that's very interesting because that seems like a bad choice for the environment because they what they expect you to do is

31:12.000 --> 31:14.920
Get a little styrofoam bowl, huh? I guess it just carry around

31:16.680 --> 31:21.800
And also often there are spoons involved and yeah, like I'm gonna spoon out some trail mix for myself

31:21.800 --> 31:27.200
I just wonder around with it. Yeah, I'm into your hand into your paw and that way it is very eco-friendly

31:28.000 --> 31:32.120
But that's gone now because of COVID. They don't big jug of trail mix

31:32.120 --> 31:33.160
Oh

31:33.160 --> 31:37.400
COVID yeah takes everything from me. How is it? How have you been?

31:38.840 --> 31:42.040
So the past like I don't know. What has it been? It's been almost exactly

31:43.240 --> 31:49.480
13 months since things were sideways. How you been? How you been handling it Ron? It's always ups and downs ebbs and flows

31:49.480 --> 31:54.800
You know, it was terrifying for first couple months and not knowing could stand up was always

31:55.480 --> 32:01.080
not just my main source of income, but my how I kind of defined myself, so kind of forced me to

32:01.080 --> 32:05.400
Redefine myself as more of a full person

32:05.400 --> 32:12.440
which I think is probably for the best and then it just allowed me to start doing other things like the twitch and the

32:12.600 --> 32:19.000
more voiceovers and and be home more with my family and which was a true blessing to get you know married and

32:19.160 --> 32:25.120
Hang around with my son as he's getting ready to turn 18 before he's you know, doesn't want to hang out with me anymore

32:25.120 --> 32:32.240
So and then you know taking some opportunities. I never I might not have done before like the the chop 420

32:32.320 --> 32:37.360
Or you know, I got a movie coming out called golden arm on the 30th. So at the end of it

32:37.440 --> 32:44.160
I'm like things are kind of okay. I'm all fine and it makes me more grateful for when I can go back and do stand up

32:44.800 --> 32:50.400
Whenever I can well i'm going out and do some in may so i'm trying nice to stay grateful and happy

32:50.400 --> 32:56.240
Did you pick up any hobbies any non-entertainment hobbies? I started taking singing lessons

32:56.480 --> 33:00.160
But that sounds like it wasn't for like entertainment. It was just for me

33:00.720 --> 33:04.160
So I just started taking some singing lessons and do that. Um

33:04.960 --> 33:06.960
Every tuesday when I can

33:06.960 --> 33:13.280
That's nice. I recently started taking blacksmith classes, but that is for entertainment purposes because I would like to win forged in fire

33:15.600 --> 33:19.520
Have you found it have you found it hard we were kind of jokingly grousing about this last week

33:19.520 --> 33:24.720
Have you found it hard to like or maybe two weeks? I don't know. Have you found it hard to like come up with new?

33:25.760 --> 33:32.160
Uh, uh creative idea have you been like creatively stymied at all by like the lack of of new inputs?

33:32.480 --> 33:36.880
Uh from the outside world. Oh, yeah, I haven't written a joke in probably a year for sure

33:37.200 --> 33:43.440
Uh, I was gonna ask is that like hey anyone ever noticed how sometimes you come down for breakfast and your favorite chair

33:45.120 --> 33:48.080
A little bit to the right and you're like, well who moved my chair, you know

33:48.080 --> 33:52.640
I want you guys don't talk about have you guys ever noticed that my wife cindy mccroy does this one thing?

33:55.120 --> 34:00.800
Yeah, yeah, I mean pretty much you got it lack of stimulus, you know, but i've been able to write I did write a couple things

34:00.880 --> 34:02.240
but I just

34:02.240 --> 34:05.760
Would change it to other things instead. You know, I wrote a couple. Um

34:07.040 --> 34:11.600
Just script ideas some treatments out and try to do it that way which isn't as

34:12.480 --> 34:15.200
Instantly gratifying as doing stand up

34:15.200 --> 34:18.480
But I felt like you know when you're writing jokes

34:19.360 --> 34:23.280
If you can't practice them if you can't get in front of an audience, I just kind of get stale

34:24.080 --> 34:26.080
Yeah, pardon me

34:26.240 --> 34:27.600
No, no

34:27.600 --> 34:33.600
So I just was like hey ron. That was a very cute sneeze process adorable. Thank you

34:36.160 --> 34:38.160
Yeah, it's that I am who I am

34:40.320 --> 34:42.800
Now that we've gotten that out of the way all that personal

34:42.800 --> 34:49.520
Personal personal stuff because I think it's nice to check in and we have honestly it's kind of self-serving because I have

34:50.320 --> 34:52.320
Not a lot of other adults to talk to

34:52.720 --> 34:54.320
So like it is

34:54.320 --> 35:00.000
I've kind of using this to my own ends. I'm sorry to uh to listeners for abusing your your time that way

35:00.080 --> 35:06.880
But hey all these perspectives. I feel like the real downside of this is going to be when people start writing a lot about it

35:07.040 --> 35:08.480
and it's like

35:08.480 --> 35:14.080
The everyone's experiences are so similar. I feel like this is gonna be like it's gonna uh, uh

35:14.800 --> 35:17.360
Have this one period like if you set a movie

35:18.240 --> 35:20.720
in this time period are you going to like

35:21.440 --> 35:25.520
Do I guess you just won't right? Well, we're just all gonna pretend we didn't do this for a year

35:25.600 --> 35:30.880
That's what I feel like. I feel like maybe one person gets to do a great one and that's it

35:31.280 --> 35:37.040
and then other than that like I don't I that's what i've been noticing from going out and doing some stand up is that

35:37.040 --> 35:42.960
When people get on stage and they start like being like, oh I went through this and that people are like, yeah

35:46.320 --> 35:52.000
Yeah, we all did and so it's like I think um and what I truly enjoy is that people are just want to be like

35:52.000 --> 35:52.960
Hey

35:52.960 --> 36:00.160
I've been stressed out just be silly and make me happy and i'm like that's what I mean that to me is

36:00.960 --> 36:04.160
Um was what I realized like oh, that's my that's my job

36:04.160 --> 36:08.000
That's my purpose right now if things are super stressed out not to be like, whoa

36:08.560 --> 36:12.720
Can you believe this is going on and and i'm poking a hole at this?

36:12.800 --> 36:15.760
It's like let me try to relieve some stress, you know

36:16.160 --> 36:21.200
Yeah, uh, can I do a quick poll real quick for our listeners and a poll a poll. Yeah

36:21.680 --> 36:25.200
Um people listening and of course my two brothers ron and justin

36:25.680 --> 36:32.080
Um when you picture a movie about covid and like starring someone and they're having the experience

36:32.080 --> 36:35.280
Does anybody else picture steve carell or is that just me?

36:35.280 --> 36:38.080
It's just immediately something about it makes me think steve carell

36:38.320 --> 36:42.400
Is going to be the star of the movie about someone's experience through covid

36:42.960 --> 36:48.880
Um, I don't I have not gotten that uh, necessarily. I I guess I kind of

36:49.680 --> 36:56.240
Uh for some reason imagine jason siegel who sure seems like oh like oh no something else happened to jason siegel

36:56.240 --> 36:57.600
Not again

36:57.600 --> 37:01.840
A lot of the stuff that's happening with him. Um, uh, and I feel like jason siegel

37:01.840 --> 37:03.840
would be the one to make one

37:04.320 --> 37:05.440
um

37:05.440 --> 37:08.240
So tall it's jason statham and he shrinks down

37:09.840 --> 37:15.280
Over directly. Yes. Yes takes the fight to covid. Where's that osmosis jones sequel?

37:17.760 --> 37:22.560
There's a bad there's a real bad dude on the block now now we really gotta get in there now

37:23.200 --> 37:25.360
It's all animated except live action

37:25.680 --> 37:30.960
Jason statham who's been shrunk down interspace style to get in there and fight alongside osmosis jones

37:30.960 --> 37:33.280
And I believe a tylenol pill

37:34.320 --> 37:39.360
Uh, well, it was not it was not real. Uh, it was dricks. Uh, uh

37:40.000 --> 37:44.080
Was so it was not a dricks at all. So it's not a real time. Oh, right, right, right, right

37:44.160 --> 37:48.400
And and they were fighting anthrax if I remember correctly his name was just thracks

37:48.480 --> 37:52.880
But yeah, that is the that was the implication that it was anthrax

37:52.880 --> 38:00.800
That one white blood cell and I believe a cold and flu pill we're gonna take out anthrax. What a wild movie

38:01.360 --> 38:03.760
And they were all inside uh bill murray's body

38:04.560 --> 38:05.840
um

38:05.840 --> 38:08.880
More movies should take place. This was where this one should take place

38:08.880 --> 38:16.480
I don't want to give bill murray covid but if anyone could make make something out of it he can yeah, he's gonna be unsafe

38:17.040 --> 38:19.520
I hope so. Hope he's not crashing weddings

38:19.520 --> 38:23.120
I don't know. I I I would actually I would love to

38:23.680 --> 38:27.520
Ask just random people on the street like do you think bill murray's been safe for the past year?

38:27.840 --> 38:30.800
Because I feel like it's 50 50 of my head. I have no idea

38:30.960 --> 38:35.920
He's a bit of a recluse so he could just dial that up a little bit and been like super recluse

38:35.920 --> 38:37.920
But he also seems to like appearing in places

38:39.840 --> 38:41.840
Um, hey, we're gonna take a quick break

38:42.560 --> 38:44.560
uh from the the

38:45.520 --> 38:47.520
hubbub of making a podcast

38:47.520 --> 38:53.840
To sell things to you and attempt to sell things to you an assignment. We call the money zone

38:54.800 --> 38:58.320

39:27.780 --> 39:29.780

41:12.980 --> 41:16.340
Love the things i've used them. I've had them used on me

41:16.340 --> 41:20.820
Um by which I mean people have sent things to me using stamps

41:20.900 --> 41:24.740
Not that people put stamps on me and ship me like I was flat stanley. Sure. I understand

41:24.820 --> 41:28.740
Yeah, you get me and so that's why I love stamps.com because I love stamps

41:29.140 --> 41:35.940
But I don't necessarily like going anywhere other than where I already currently am at any given moment

41:36.260 --> 41:37.380
You know what I mean?

41:37.380 --> 41:40.740
I don't want to take trips to the post office. I want to just be able to send things from my home

41:40.740 --> 41:43.540
So stamps.com allows me to mail and ship anywhere

41:43.540 --> 41:46.180
Right from where you are right from your computer, right?

41:46.260 --> 41:52.020
So whether you're a small office sending out invoices and online sellers shipping out letters or even a giant

41:52.660 --> 41:53.940
warehouse

41:53.940 --> 41:59.460
Uh, it's important I think to include the warehouse part or even a giant sending thousands of packages a day

41:59.860 --> 42:02.900
Stamps.com can handle all of that with ease with stamps.com

42:02.900 --> 42:08.900
You get discounts of up to 40 off post office rates and up to 62 off ups shipping rates

MaxFunDrive 2021 is coming

42:46.600 --> 42:48.600
It'll be May 3rd to May 14th

42:48.920 --> 42:53.960
To get in the spirit we ask folks like you to let us know what maximum fun and our shows mean to them

42:54.680 --> 42:58.280
You know the the maximum fun network is really important to me because

42:58.920 --> 43:01.660
It is not just a collection of podcasts

43:02.280 --> 43:04.280
But it is a lifestyle

43:04.680 --> 43:06.600
And a value system

43:06.600 --> 43:12.840
The podcasts frequently and deftly float between meaningful and irreverent in one moment drawing attention to social issues

43:13.080 --> 43:15.640
And in another making dick jokes about Klingons

43:16.040 --> 43:22.680
It shouldn't work, but it does and I have to believe it's because MaxFun's podcasts are at their core

43:23.300 --> 43:28.360
Thoughtful and kind and human during a time that has often felt cold and isolated

43:29.080 --> 43:32.360
So keep being great and doing what you do

43:32.360 --> 43:38.040
MaxFunDrive will be May 3rd to May 14th 2021 and you won't want to miss it

43:38.520 --> 43:41.880
Brilliant apps drive exclusive gifts and maybe some surprises

43:42.360 --> 43:48.060
Want to directly support the hosts of the show? We just jumped into come back May 3rd for MaxFunDrive

43:54.920 --> 43:57.720
Okay, do you guys want to hear another yahoo answers question

43:58.760 --> 43:59.800
Yes

43:59.800 --> 44:03.240
Yeah, okay. This was sent in by Michelle Smith

44:04.680 --> 44:07.800
And and the question here this is asked by Bush

44:08.760 --> 44:15.800
Which celebrity could eat the most hot dogs if given the time and motivation to do so?

44:18.200 --> 44:19.960
And let me be clear here

44:19.960 --> 44:27.080
I think the answer to this could literally be anybody right? But yeah, I I don't think it has anything to do and like with

44:27.080 --> 44:30.600
with sort of their their their the physical body

44:30.600 --> 44:34.680
I think it's more about like the spirit because if you look at the some of the competitive eaters

44:35.000 --> 44:40.280
They're not people who you feel like have been eating like a while like they they're surprising

44:40.360 --> 44:45.420
It's a surprising thing and the best part about this question to me is one word and that is motivation

44:46.280 --> 44:48.040
given the motivation

44:48.040 --> 44:51.640
To eat the motivation, right? They have to save their village or something

44:51.640 --> 44:57.480
I don't know whatever the motivation or like if they switched up some of the like qualifications to win an oscar this year

44:57.880 --> 45:02.840
You know what I mean? It was like whoever can eat the most hot dogs, right? I have two answers. Okay. Okay

45:03.480 --> 45:06.460
Okay, the first answer I think is probably

45:07.240 --> 45:11.320
The most logical answer is this person I think can eat a lot

45:11.320 --> 45:17.720
We've seen it on their instagram that they can eat quite a bit when given the motivation. They also work out a bunch

45:17.720 --> 45:21.880
And I think yes, they are the perfect specimen. Yep

45:22.440 --> 45:24.440
They are the beyonce for boys

45:24.520 --> 45:28.760
Yeah, the only person that could be both president and a competitive eater

45:29.320 --> 45:35.100
Yeah, that is dwayne the rock johnson. I mean, it's a perfect answer. I mean, it's it's it's indisputable

45:35.720 --> 45:40.440
Um, and he seems like a highly motivated man, right highly motivated to put it away

45:40.520 --> 45:44.680
Like highly the rock seems like if he put his mind to anything

45:44.680 --> 45:48.680
He would do it right like yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

45:49.240 --> 45:52.440
My second answer is helen mirren because oh, okay

45:53.160 --> 45:55.160
She commits to everything she does commit

45:55.800 --> 46:00.920
See, I think cluny could put him away. I think cluny I I could see him

46:01.720 --> 46:04.520
Being suave and looking cool while he does it

46:05.080 --> 46:07.080
But just kind of quietly

46:07.080 --> 46:14.940
Consuming an absurd amount of hot dogs. Yeah ben affleck ben affleck could either ben affleck could oh

46:15.100 --> 46:17.100
If they challenge I would like to see the three

46:17.740 --> 46:19.740
Uh oceans 11 leads, of course

46:20.860 --> 46:28.300
I think the three of them brad pitt ben affleck. No way matt damon. I always get those two confused matt damon

46:28.620 --> 46:29.580
uh

46:29.580 --> 46:35.580
Brad pitt and cluny sit down and just have a hot dog eating contest. I'd like i'd pay to see that

46:35.580 --> 46:37.260
You know what I mean?

46:37.260 --> 46:42.460
That feels like one of the pranks they would have had that they love pranks and they love their pranks

46:42.700 --> 46:48.220
They do love their pranks. That's a good point. You guys know about that time that uh, the cluny shit in a cat box

46:49.180 --> 46:50.140
travis

46:50.140 --> 46:54.540
That's real. It was a prank. It sounds apocryphal to me, but no this is a prank

46:54.540 --> 46:56.300
He was saying i'm trying to remember who he was staying with

46:56.540 --> 47:00.460
It's something weird like maybe danny davido or somebody who's staying with them and every morning

47:00.460 --> 47:05.580
Uh cluny would clean the person's cat box before they woke up and so for like a week

47:05.660 --> 47:08.620
The person thought that the cat wasn't going to the bathroom

47:08.860 --> 47:10.860
And so then one morning cluny

47:11.020 --> 47:16.620
Took a dump in the cat box and left it there for the person to find and the person was like, holy shit

47:16.940 --> 47:21.340
Cat just made a big human-sized dookie. That's such a why can I say something?

47:21.340 --> 47:30.300
Listen, that's such a wild way to balance out the karma of cleaning out the person's litter box.

47:30.540 --> 47:37.020
Like so would it be like was george cluny your houseguest and you just sit there in silence for 10 minutes and be like well shit

47:38.700 --> 47:40.700
Well, I don't know

47:41.180 --> 47:42.220
um

47:42.220 --> 47:45.020
I do hate cleaning the litter box also

47:46.060 --> 47:48.060
Can we also imagine like?

47:48.620 --> 47:50.540
They're usually in clothes

47:50.540 --> 47:52.620
So yeah, right you had to climb in there

47:58.380 --> 48:03.100
This is what i'm saying he was he was motivated and he did it he figured it out

48:04.540 --> 48:10.380
He wasn't gonna get shown up by that contortionist from the from the uh oceans movies george cluny can do that too

48:10.540 --> 48:14.380
I could do that for sure. Give me a half hour to get in the cat box real quick

48:15.740 --> 48:19.100
I was in tomorrowland. Come on. Give me it was richard kind

48:19.100 --> 48:25.260
Well, it was right. I looked it up. Sorry. He was staying at richard kind's house. Yep. God. There's a house party

48:25.820 --> 48:27.820
Do that to richard kind

48:29.820 --> 48:34.960
It is very tear it's terrible don't do that to richard kind he seems like he's balancing

48:35.900 --> 48:40.940
As it is that you ah that's in that would send him off. I don't want that for him

48:41.020 --> 48:44.300
He's such a nice his kind's in his name. You don't do that

48:44.380 --> 48:48.060
Yeah, when when did I turn into richard mean? Well, it's quite a story

48:48.060 --> 48:54.540
Let me told you so, you know, have you ever heard of the show er? Well sit down my friend. I got a tale to tell

48:57.580 --> 49:01.440
Do you remember a guy from the first two seasons of rosanne

49:05.740 --> 49:11.340
It's weird that george cluny was also on a sitcom called er, isn't that weird you guys ever think about that it's weird

49:12.460 --> 49:14.380
Eventually, he was also on a drama called er

49:14.380 --> 49:18.300
Yeah, I guess if somebody tries to make a show with er in it. He's just gonna show up like let me in there

49:18.300 --> 49:21.260
I get him. I got an e and an r in my name. No problem

49:22.620 --> 49:24.620

49:55.080 --> 49:58.380
Fazoles, this is not a joke when a lot of times they're funny

49:58.380 --> 50:02.300
I just want to give a heads up that fazoles is rolling out their wings

50:03.080 --> 50:05.820
System-wide this is breaking news

50:06.680 --> 50:08.680
finally, um in

50:09.420 --> 50:12.480
There's they've been having wings at some locations since september

50:13.180 --> 50:18.860
One of the gifts of covet is that I get to say the phrase new virtual wing concept wing ville

50:19.660 --> 50:23.820
From fazoles. They've been sneakily rolling these out to you via door dash and grub hub

50:23.820 --> 50:29.920
But now the time has come for uh, all fazoles to have these wings menu innovation

50:31.260 --> 50:37.340
Continues to be a key ingredient fazoles recipe for success says fazoles chief marketing officer jody conrad

50:38.300 --> 50:43.100
Delivery and drive-thru have both seen unprecedented sales growth for some time now

50:43.740 --> 50:47.900
I'm out of theory about that jody if you want to take a seat. I have some hard news for you to hear

50:47.900 --> 50:55.440
Uh, it's been impossible to eat in restaurants for 13 months. But hey, we knew how innovating our menu with an easily transportable

50:55.660 --> 51:00.860
Product like wings would be the perfect solution to leverage this shift in ordering channels

51:01.580 --> 51:06.220
Woof, wow wings have been a big contributor to our impressive achievements over the past seven months

51:06.540 --> 51:10.720
So we look forward to seeing this trend continue as we start serving them nationwide

51:11.340 --> 51:15.820
Now have you guys ever been in a fazoles and they give you a piece of pizza and you're like what the fuck am I?

51:15.820 --> 51:19.980
Supposed to do with this. How can I get this home? This isn't transportable at all

51:21.340 --> 51:23.020
No

51:23.020 --> 51:27.180
No, exactly, but that's not that's not our big story. Okay. Our big story was sent to us by jesse. Thank you

52:19.820 --> 52:22.860
Okay with the new fancy feast petite's feast cookbook

cat owners and fans of the brand

Hold on

52:30.300 --> 52:33.980
Explain to me why you need to delineate between cat owners

52:33.980 --> 52:38.940
You don't have to you don't have to own a cat to like fancy feast

52:39.660 --> 52:45.340
You can just support the brand. I just like what they're doing over there. I just think they're doing good work

52:46.540 --> 52:48.380
fans of the brand

52:48.380 --> 52:52.540
Can now cook meals inspired by their cat's favorite dishes. Oh boy

But made for you

52:55.020 --> 52:59.580

52:59.580 --> 53:05.100
Okay, print this motherfucker, let's go get it on ebay careful careful

53:06.060 --> 53:10.300
This single surf cookbook features 12 delectable human recipes

53:10.780 --> 53:15.260
Inspired by your cat's new favorite petite's entrees. Now. This is a weird little

53:16.460 --> 53:20.220
Weird little cul-de-sac. They've included here is that the recipes

53:21.100 --> 53:25.420
Are also single serve, uh-huh, which I think oh they'd have to be

53:25.420 --> 53:29.100
Kind of they're kind of just it's a little judgmental. No, no

53:30.140 --> 53:33.900
In the audience of a person who would buy a fancy feast cookbook

53:34.540 --> 53:39.740
You welcome for one and also your but maybe for 12 cats, but one person

53:40.460 --> 53:43.980
Yeah fair. You should actually take the time to dine with each of your cats

53:43.980 --> 53:46.940
And if that means you have to eat 12 single serving meals, so be it

53:47.420 --> 53:49.580
Uh, you have to give each of them the attention they deserve

53:50.700 --> 53:53.980
Now these are carefully crafted by fancy feasts in-house chef

53:53.980 --> 53:55.980
hmm, amanda hasner

53:55.980 --> 53:59.900
Along with guest additions from james beard award my name is jerel guy

54:01.180 --> 54:07.740
Yeah, uh, james beard award nominee jerel guy and actor turned baker josh schneider the petite's

54:08.380 --> 54:10.380
Chrissy tegan. Wow

54:10.860 --> 54:13.900
Do you just you're just making stuff up such a get

54:14.620 --> 54:19.500
The petite's feet cookbook allows cat owners to take part in the dining experience with their cats

54:19.500 --> 54:25.740
From chicken and ramen with tomato honey butter sauce to white fish and asparagus with beurre blanc

54:26.460 --> 54:31.100
The cookbook features recipes that are elevated but easy enough to whip up on a weeknight

54:31.420 --> 54:35.820
Now i'm going to stop you right there fancy feast in-house chef from an hasner. That does not seem

54:36.380 --> 54:43.580
Easy enough to whip up on a weeknight, but please go on each dish was inspired by the small plate restaurant trend and cat food

54:43.660 --> 54:47.580
Also, you can't forget that cat food. So let's go ahead and get started

54:47.580 --> 54:51.500
You can't forget that cat food. The recipes are for humans. Okay

54:52.300 --> 54:56.060
Not normally something you have to clarify in a recipe scenario

54:56.060 --> 55:01.020
But the recipes are for humans, but were created in honor of the dishes. You will be serving your cat

55:02.220 --> 55:03.180
now

55:03.180 --> 55:06.860
Um, there's there's more to the press release, but I do want to stop for a second

55:08.140 --> 55:10.140
fancy feast petites

55:11.100 --> 55:16.220
Are single serving, uh, uh cat foods that you peel and dump in a bowl

55:16.220 --> 55:17.180
Yep

55:17.180 --> 55:20.060
Do you feel like a cat would watch you?

55:20.860 --> 55:21.980
whip up

55:21.980 --> 55:29.740
some uh, uh, uh white fish and asparagus with beurre blanc for like an hour and a half and a cat be like listen

55:29.820 --> 55:31.820
I appreciate the effort so much

55:31.980 --> 55:37.500
But how is it that you're just gonna like open up a package and dump it into a dirty ball for me?

55:37.820 --> 55:42.460
But you're gonna spend this kind of time on product for you. I feel like there's still an imbalance here

55:42.460 --> 55:48.380
I feel like we haven't rectified what's different between the two of us. I also do like the implication here

55:48.780 --> 55:49.900
that like

55:49.900 --> 55:55.820
You would do this and sit down to eat and the cat would think oh finally you're joining me in this

55:56.380 --> 56:00.940
Yeah, your cat is not going to enjoy this. You could try to get your cat to eat with you

56:01.020 --> 56:04.620
I don't think your cat. How was your day? Wait, where are you going? What's wrong?

56:05.260 --> 56:08.300
You know for too long dogs have had

56:08.300 --> 56:13.820
Uh, um just the stranglehold of sitting and eating with their owner

56:14.140 --> 56:16.140
They've had lady in the tramp

56:16.540 --> 56:19.340
And I feel like that's what cat owners want here

56:19.500 --> 56:24.860
They want to be able to just share a meal and sit down with their cat pull out a little

56:25.720 --> 56:30.700
Magical cloche and just open it up and one dish for you one dish for the cat

56:31.260 --> 56:34.460
And and this is just something to really just go

56:34.460 --> 56:39.180
This is who I am and i've gone this far and i'm aware of who I am and that's why

56:40.140 --> 56:44.140
I'm comfortable with myself and I love the I love the idea

56:44.460 --> 56:48.220
I just don't think a cat I don't feel like your cat is going to indulge you

56:48.460 --> 56:51.100
I don't feel like you're going to say to your cat. Well, it's time to eat together

56:51.100 --> 56:57.020
Now that would be the funniest thing though is if you do this on then your cat ghosts you on dinner

56:57.260 --> 57:01.740
Oh, yeah, 100 that will be that I know cats i've had cats that will be the outcome

57:01.740 --> 57:04.380
You're gonna get screwed up by something that lives in your house

57:05.180 --> 57:07.180
You're gonna here's what's gonna happen

57:07.660 --> 57:09.340
You will uh

57:09.340 --> 57:15.340
Sit until your food gets cold and then you'll dump your food and your cat's food in the trash

57:15.740 --> 57:18.880
You will go to bed and your cat will be like fucking finally

57:19.260 --> 57:24.060
And climb up into the trash and eat all the food. That's cats. That's cats in a nutshell

57:24.060 --> 57:29.420
Now I will say though that this is reminding me very much of the commercials that played when I was a kid where

57:29.420 --> 57:34.220
I think it was cat food. They'd put that little puck of cat food onto like a crystal bowl

57:34.780 --> 57:38.940
Oh, yeah, a little leaf on it. I do remember thinking as a kid like that looks good

57:39.340 --> 57:42.380
And I think it's all presentation, but I was interested

57:43.980 --> 57:46.540
These retail for a dollar at seven, so come on

57:47.100 --> 57:52.860
You're uh, come on. Just make two servings of verblanc. I don't know if cats can have verblanc

57:53.180 --> 57:57.340
Just between you me and the lord. Jesus christ guys. I don't even know what verblanc is exactly

57:57.340 --> 58:02.620
It's something white justin. It's burr white. It's definitely a sauce. That's yeah some type of sauce

58:04.060 --> 58:09.660
Also, I don't even feel like petite cats is is the style of meal that I would trust

58:10.380 --> 58:14.700
To be like, oh, that's what you know, I want what a husky cat would want. I want a husky cat

58:18.540 --> 58:22.700
They already make those they're just called hungry man meals and you just rip them up in a microwave

58:22.700 --> 58:27.500
And no problem if your cat saw you doing that they would think ah equal playing ground. Okay, cool

58:28.380 --> 58:32.220
What let me hit you with this idea where rather than trying harder

58:33.340 --> 58:35.340
For to eat with your cat

58:35.500 --> 58:37.900
You should be able to try less for everybody

58:38.300 --> 58:44.460
So what i'm suggesting now to you guys is a is an instant microwave meal like a tv dinner. They used to call them

58:45.020 --> 58:48.620
An instant microwave meal where one of the things in it

58:49.580 --> 58:51.260
Is cat food. Oh

58:51.260 --> 58:53.260
so you got

58:53.980 --> 58:56.700
You got your chicken nuggets you got your brownie

58:57.180 --> 59:02.540
You got your corn that some of the brownie leaked into that's the best corn. You got your cat food right there

59:02.940 --> 59:06.540
Hey everybody soup's on for all of us. Oh, we're all eating together

59:06.620 --> 59:07.500
You know what?

59:07.500 --> 59:12.780
It should be uh, you can tear it away to be a little separate bowl for the cat or not

59:13.180 --> 59:15.980
You know what? I mean if the cat just wants to hop up there next to you

59:16.380 --> 59:20.700
And every like and you guys just kind of lean your heads down and both eat it out of the bowl

59:20.700 --> 59:22.700
Yeah, it's fine. Yeah

59:23.340 --> 59:29.020
No, that's the experience that you're really looking for right of eating over the bowl together with your cat. That's what

59:30.140 --> 59:32.620
that's what you want if you are a cat owner or

59:33.340 --> 59:36.860
Of paying a fancy freeze either way now i'm thinking through this now

59:37.020 --> 59:40.060
We are going to have to be real explicit with the labeling on this

59:40.460 --> 59:45.360
Because I have eaten some chocolate puddings in kid cuisines that are indistinguishable

59:45.360 --> 59:50.640
Indistinguishable from uh from from cat food so that that would be it won't kill you

59:51.120 --> 59:56.640
It'll be she'll be fine. It'd be almost like, you know, they do those mystery candies or the mystery

59:57.520 --> 59:59.520
Which one's cat food?

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.500
That's our guys that's our tagline you'll never guess which one's captured

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.200
You guess which one's cat food will send your coupon for another one

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.960
Double and then it's double or nothing. We'll send you two the next time you get it. Hey, uh, ron
