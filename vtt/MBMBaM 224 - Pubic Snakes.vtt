00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.960
Hello everybody and welcome to Birthday Boys, a special birthday podcast for the three birthday

00:48.960 --> 00:53.760
boys of my brother and my brother and me. My name is Justin McElroy and it is my birthday

00:53.760 --> 00:57.920
on Saturday. My name is Travis McElroy and it's my birthday on Saturday.

00:57.920 --> 01:08.960
Hi, I'm Griffin McElroy and my birthday is cancelled for just the rest of my life.

01:08.960 --> 01:10.000
No more birthdays for me.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.600
Is it your birthday on Saturday, Griffin?

01:11.600 --> 01:12.640
My birthday is on Saturday.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.640
It's my birthday on Saturday. The McElroy brothers have their birthdays on Saturday.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.520
I like to think that when the two of you have birthdays, the world birthdays with you.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.360
Well, yeah, except it's not actually their birthday so they don't get anything.

01:25.360 --> 01:28.480
Like you don't, you aren't going to get gifts, right, Griffin?

01:28.480 --> 01:28.960
I mean, it's a nice birthday.

01:28.960 --> 01:34.400
Daddy actually still sends me presents on your guy's joint birthday.

01:35.760 --> 01:36.160
Really?

01:36.960 --> 01:40.720
I'm going to have to have my people talk to his people.

01:40.720 --> 01:41.920
My birthday people.

01:41.920 --> 01:46.800
Griffin, now I heard you, I heard you went to Japan and I think the question on everybody's

01:46.800 --> 01:50.320
mind that everybody's been wondering about and has been asking about is,

01:50.320 --> 01:52.320
did you get us any birthday presents there?

01:52.320 --> 01:54.400
I got you travel presents.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.400
Your birthday presents will be American made, American bought, and American owned.

01:58.400 --> 02:02.160
Oh my God, this is such a good transition into our first question.

02:02.160 --> 02:05.600
Okay, we haven't said anything funny yet, so should we keep trying?

02:07.600 --> 02:08.560
Why start now?

02:09.520 --> 02:10.320
Why start now?

02:10.320 --> 02:11.440
Here's our first question.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.920
I recently traveled to South America for a little over a month ago.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.760
My family members some pretty nice gifts.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.320
Normally when I travel, I give Suvies.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.400
Normally when I travel, I give Suvies.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.000
Oh man.

02:24.880 --> 02:28.400
Oh wow, I was not ready for that part with a little bit of neologism.

02:30.320 --> 02:35.120
I give Suvies soon after I come back with candle nights fast approaching.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.680
I'm considering wrapping them and giving them as presents.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.040
Is this tacky?

02:39.040 --> 02:41.200
This is from Classless in Canada.

02:41.200 --> 02:48.880
Uh, I'm actually into it because it kind of feels like you were thinking about this so early.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.680
Like I prepped early for your Christmas present.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.880
I was super prepared.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.400
I would say there's a caveat though.

02:57.040 --> 03:02.400
And that caveat is it depends, like you can't, like I got you this $3 magnet,

03:02.400 --> 03:06.400
but because I got it from out of the country, it pretty much covers Christmas.

03:06.400 --> 03:12.080
Has anybody ever gotten you an intercontinental, is that right?

03:12.080 --> 03:12.320
Yeah.

03:13.600 --> 03:18.400
A global gift that you were like, you just blew me away.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.120
Or I feel like it's, I don't, I'm trying to couch your

03:21.120 --> 03:23.520
guys expectations for the Japanese presents that I got you.

03:25.040 --> 03:29.040
But it's, I always find it very difficult to buy things overseas.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.440
And I think it's like, this is so dope.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.480
They're going to love this.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.760
Because you have a lot more restrictions there.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.320
I mean, you're handing the person a thing and you're basically saying,

03:38.320 --> 03:40.160
guess what fit in my suitcase?

03:40.160 --> 03:40.880
Yeah, right.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.640
That's what didn't break.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.360
I didn't bring you back like authentic samurai armor.

03:45.920 --> 03:46.080
Right.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.520
You're trying to thread a lot of needles.

03:48.160 --> 03:53.760
It depends on also how, how, how far apart your travel and candle nights is.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.240
Cause if it's man, I don't know if it's like nine months, it's like,

03:56.240 --> 04:00.640
you could just give me that nine months ago and then got me extra presents.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.000
That's what I'm talking to you guys about.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.040
Do I ship you guys this shit now and then get you some, some real American,

04:07.040 --> 04:11.520
true American presence or do you only want half of the presents?

04:11.520 --> 04:13.360
Cause that seems like a pretty easy choice to me.

04:14.960 --> 04:18.640
I mean, I want double the presence.

04:18.640 --> 04:19.040
Right.

04:19.040 --> 04:24.000
Do you want to let me off the hook for having to figure out what the fuck you guys are into?

04:24.560 --> 04:28.080
Like what stuff you desire as humans now?

04:28.080 --> 04:32.880
Um, how about you just like start buying presents and we'll tell you when to stop.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.440
Open your wallet.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.720
We'll, we'll wave you off.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.960
In fact, you just want to give me your credit card information.

04:38.960 --> 04:42.400
I've got a wishlist a mile long on Amazon and I will take care of it.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.120
Well, I mean, it is also your birthday, so I could just,

04:46.240 --> 04:49.840
I mean, we're talking, we're getting into triple present territory and I'm not made of money.

04:49.840 --> 04:50.800
I'm made of flesh.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.280
Can't buy things with flesh.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.640
This isn't Hellraiser.

04:54.640 --> 05:02.400
I would say that like you can do a souvenirs as presents and, you know, if you're the

05:02.400 --> 05:09.360
You're saying they're a supplement, a present dressing, a present condiment.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.080
Exactly.

05:10.080 --> 05:14.240
I'm a person who likes to do like three or four gifts per person for Christmas.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.520
So like you can swap that out.

05:17.520 --> 05:22.400
And as long as it's like a gift, you would normally give them.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.000
Does that make sense?

05:24.000 --> 05:28.080
Like if it's something where it's like, I didn't just get this because I got it from

05:28.080 --> 05:28.800
another country.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.440
I got it for you because it made me think of you.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.400
And it's like a specific present I bought for you.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.680
Not just like, I buy you a Nova Scotian flag.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.920
Like if it's like, well, it is Nova Scotia.

05:39.920 --> 05:40.320
Yeah, fine.

05:40.960 --> 05:43.040
They don't have, they do not have a flag.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.640
I'm sure they have some sort of flag.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.120
So like, welcome to Nova Scotia.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.640
Nova Scotia is for lovers.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.800
It's just Ellen Page giving a thumbs up.

05:50.800 --> 05:57.840
I think that the nice thing about giving it during candle nights is that you spare yourself

05:57.840 --> 06:02.800
the awkwardness of the person not having a reciprocal gift.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.600
Like, oh, that's the worst.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.440
You got me this from China.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.320
That's cool.

06:08.320 --> 06:14.640
I was in Logan County and I have half a Gatorade left from that trip.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.680
That's not the scenario.

06:15.680 --> 06:21.200
The scenario is next time you go on international travels, you know you got.

06:21.200 --> 06:28.880
We have friends who spent the summer in Africa and when they came back, they brought us like

06:28.880 --> 06:31.360
shirts that they had made for us.

06:31.920 --> 06:39.440
Like out of these like beautiful fabrics that were like sized to fit and all looked super

06:39.440 --> 06:40.240
dope on us.

06:40.240 --> 06:46.240
And it's like, thanks guys, we will never ever be able to feel okay.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.520
There's nowhere we could go.

06:47.520 --> 06:49.520
Now we have to stop being friends.

06:49.520 --> 06:49.840
Right.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.560
I got you a BMW.

06:52.560 --> 06:55.760
I went to Germany and I got you an authentic, that's where those are made, right?

06:56.720 --> 06:59.600
I got you an authentic Swiss Rolex.

07:00.160 --> 07:04.640
I think this is why everyone before your friends leave for an international trip, you should

07:04.640 --> 07:08.080
just remind them what kind of weird little tchotchkes you collect.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.640
If you're like shot glasses, it's easy.

07:10.640 --> 07:14.720
I'm going to take this weight off your shoulder, just to get me a shot glass.

07:14.720 --> 07:17.600
I collect nail clippers from around the world.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.880
Just that's it.

07:18.880 --> 07:24.800
Having a collection is really a gift that you give to other people.

07:24.800 --> 07:29.040
I mean, that is the most beautiful thing you could do is have a collection because now

07:29.040 --> 07:38.160
anytime anybody is like hard up, let me just get Justin a full motion video Sega CD game

07:38.160 --> 07:41.680
from wherever country I'm at and I'll just bring that home for him.

07:41.680 --> 07:42.640
No problem.

07:42.640 --> 07:43.920
That's their whole fucking trip.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.600
It's like, what are we doing on Wednesday?

07:45.600 --> 07:47.280
We're in Sydney, Australia.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.480
What are we going to do on Wednesday?

07:48.480 --> 07:54.000
Well, we got to find a fucking video game store, a used video game store that is very

07:54.000 --> 07:54.960
well stocked.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.120
I hear there's a back alley vendor.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.120
He's got the full motion videos right next to them.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.320
They've got to be NTSC format, which is going to be very difficult to find here.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.280
And it looks like the only one he does not have is double switch.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.680
So call it another shrimp on the Atari.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.240
No, why would it?

08:12.240 --> 08:13.360
It might do that.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.040
This Yahoo was sent in by Ryan Berry.

08:15.040 --> 08:15.680
Thank you, Ryan.

08:15.680 --> 08:19.680
It's by Yahoo answers user G who asks, I had a wet dream.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.600
I was being chased by a bear.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.280
Wait, what?

08:24.960 --> 08:26.320
There's no additional information.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.200
That's all you get.

08:27.200 --> 08:27.680
Damn it.

08:29.920 --> 08:30.400
Oh, God.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.680
The bear is going to eat me.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.680
And also, why am I coming?

08:33.680 --> 08:34.320
Oh, God.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.960
I love cake.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.720
But you know what bears don't know?

08:38.720 --> 08:39.840
Safe words.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.120
That's no, I can't imagine.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.720
It's a pretty good defense mechanism.

08:42.720 --> 08:46.720
The bears like, whoa, whoa, I'm going to go.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.480
You said DuckTales.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.440
So I'm going to back up.

08:50.720 --> 08:55.840
No, DuckTales can't be our parental password.

08:55.840 --> 09:02.080
To know that an adult is down and also be safe for rough stuff.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.600
Do you think it's possible that this person doesn't know what wet dream means?

09:05.600 --> 09:09.600
And they got so scared that they wet the bed and then they woke up and like, I'm a man.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.280
Or they woke up covered in honey.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.160
It wasn't a dream.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.200
It was a dream.

09:16.400 --> 09:21.360
By the way, this is posted in Yahoo answers section titled dream interpretation.

09:21.360 --> 09:25.920
So you know that's all that we're doing for the next episode.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.240
Our special dream interpretation episode.

09:29.520 --> 09:33.680
Did anyone try to interpret this particular nighttime journey?

09:35.600 --> 09:40.080
Yahoo answers user Jamie did say, well, there's such a thing as an erotic nightmare,

09:40.080 --> 09:44.080
which by the way, is the new subtitle of my brother, my brother and me.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.880
An erotic nightmare for the modern era.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.120
Even though I never had one.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.320
What others are saying is correct.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.560
Besides when you dream or have nightmares,

09:54.560 --> 09:58.640
you're in REM sleep in which you will normally have an erection anyway.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.000
No fucking way.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.280
Is that true, Jamie?

10:01.280 --> 10:02.560
How were your Zs last night?

10:02.560 --> 10:02.800
Good.

10:02.800 --> 10:08.480
I got down to like REM level four was hard as a rock the whole time.

10:08.480 --> 10:09.440
Hey, let me ask you guys.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.120
Did you guys ever have wet dreams?

10:13.120 --> 10:13.760
Is this a real?

10:14.480 --> 10:15.360
I'm asking you too.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.080
Did you ever have wet dreams growing up?

10:18.080 --> 10:20.880
I was so worried about having a wet dream.

10:20.880 --> 10:25.280
I was very proactive about making sure that would be a biological impossibility.

10:26.080 --> 10:26.960
Wet dreams.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.840
You guys ever have a wet dream?

10:29.840 --> 10:31.520
I don't want to talk about this with you.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.240
Brothers.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.280
Hey, my brothers.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.920
Hey, my biological brothers.

10:35.920 --> 10:41.280
Did you guys, when you were growing up, did you ever have a wet dream?

10:41.280 --> 10:45.200
Do you ever have nocturnal emissions, brothers?

10:45.200 --> 10:46.400
So mine.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.720
I feel like the very idea of wet dreams should be a thing that like people surreptitiously

10:50.720 --> 10:52.880
bury in their backyard and never speak about.

10:54.480 --> 10:58.400
Like wet dreams is not a thing you post on Yahoo answers and say, like, I dreamed about

10:58.400 --> 10:59.360
a bear eating me.

10:59.360 --> 11:02.560
And also, apparently I was super into it.

11:02.560 --> 11:05.680
Oh, see, I didn't even consider the possibility that the bear caught and ate you.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.440
If that's the case, maybe you're into Vore.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.440
You might be in a Vore.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.320
You know what?

11:10.320 --> 11:12.160
Something I learned last time we talked about Vore.

11:12.160 --> 11:15.280
Our listeners really love it when I talk about Vore.

11:15.280 --> 11:18.640
It's like listening to Conan O'Brien talk about video games.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.040
It's like something you think that this person doesn't know about.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.440
Guys, I know all about Vore.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.200
Not that it's my particular cup of tea.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.240
I just find it very fascinating.

11:26.240 --> 11:27.200
And you know what else is weird?

11:27.200 --> 11:30.000
When you talk about Vore, that's an ASMR trigger for me.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.160
What is that?

11:32.160 --> 11:32.660
ASMR?

11:33.440 --> 11:36.080
Is it like this gentle speaking?

11:36.080 --> 11:36.560
Yeah.

11:36.560 --> 11:39.840
And like ASMR videos, I've gotten really into them lately, you guys.

11:39.840 --> 11:40.560
Yeah, me too.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.400
You have ASMR, you get tingles.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.600
Like when people-

11:43.600 --> 11:47.200
You know that, Griff, you ever get that tingle when like you're getting your haircut or like

11:47.200 --> 11:51.920
you're getting measured maybe for clothes and you get that like tingle in the back of your head.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.240
And then you wake up and you cum.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.640
No, well, no.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.800
No, it's not like that.

11:58.800 --> 12:02.160
I just find it so fascinating the things that give people bonus.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.880
Do you want to try- Hey, you know what we should do?

12:04.880 --> 12:08.640
We should do an ASMR section.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.600
Okay.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.800
Here's how you do it, right?

12:10.800 --> 12:18.400
You just talk like this and you say like, hello and welcome to my clinic.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.360
I'm going to be your pretend doctor.

12:21.360 --> 12:21.920
Let me check.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.960
Just lie back and I'm going to massage your scalp.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.680
This is my partner.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.640
What is your practice?

12:28.640 --> 12:30.400
Why are you ASMR Batman?

12:31.120 --> 12:33.520
My practice is, where's Falcone?

12:33.520 --> 12:34.960
I find Falcone.

12:35.520 --> 12:39.840
This is my partner, Dr. Travis Patrick McElroy.

12:39.840 --> 12:40.160
Hey!

12:40.160 --> 12:42.160
Who's going to take me now?

12:42.160 --> 12:44.320
Hey guys, we're here to talk to you.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.000
I don't think that was ASMR.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.760
I'm going to rub your head.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.240
Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub.

12:52.240 --> 12:52.960
I'm rubbing it.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.360
This is a gentleman rubbing your head.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.440
Scalp, scalp, scalp, scalp, scalp, scalp, scalp.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.160
Can I try it?

12:58.160 --> 12:59.440
Can I try to do it?

12:59.440 --> 13:00.240
Yeah, go for it, Griffin.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.000
Hey, everybody.

13:02.000 --> 13:12.240
This is Griffin coming at you with my soothing ASMR.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.440
I did an arm fart.

13:16.400 --> 13:25.120
What age of person is appropriate to be listening to their ASMR video?

13:26.160 --> 13:31.920
Sometimes when I'm on the ASMR creep, I find myself accidentally listening to a video

13:31.920 --> 13:34.880
of a person that might not be 18 years old.

13:34.880 --> 13:38.000
And then I have to say to myself, uh-oh, do I need to pump the brakes?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.720
Is this the Yahoo Answers question you're reading or a Justin Answers question?

13:40.720 --> 13:47.440
This is a Justin Answers special Justin Nights mystery for you guys at what age?

13:48.160 --> 13:51.600
Because you know who has free time to talk quietly into a microphone?

13:51.600 --> 13:53.040
15-year-olds.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.640
So I'm saying, is it okay to listen to an underage ASMR video?

13:56.640 --> 13:58.800
No, fucking of course not.

13:58.800 --> 13:59.600
I didn't think so.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.800
I'm going to say right here that ASMR is not inherently sexual.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.160
So yes, it's fine.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.440
What is it?

14:05.440 --> 14:05.840
What?

14:05.840 --> 14:06.320
What?

14:06.320 --> 14:07.600
Do you, it, yes.

14:08.160 --> 14:08.400
Yeah.

14:09.280 --> 14:09.840
You know what?

14:09.840 --> 14:11.440
Actually the 100% is.

14:12.640 --> 14:17.440
Because you're gleaning a very intimate sensation from those videos.

14:17.440 --> 14:23.760
You did not know what ASMR was fucking, you just went zero to judgey in like three minutes

14:23.760 --> 14:27.200
because you didn't know what ASMR was and now you decided it's sexual.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.160
Classic.

14:28.160 --> 14:28.640
What is it?

14:28.640 --> 14:30.000
If not sexual, what is it?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.840
It's just like a pleasant relaxing thing.

14:32.720 --> 14:33.440
You know what else is?

14:34.240 --> 14:34.800
Wet dreams.

14:35.360 --> 14:35.600
Yeah.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.640
Nice relaxing wet dream.

14:39.600 --> 14:43.120
You ever wake up from a wet dream just feeling like you just like guzzled down a fresca?

14:43.120 --> 14:46.240
I feel like a million bucks and also sticky.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.160
Thank you very much subconscious.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.160
I enjoyed that quite a bit.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.200
This seems like one of those segments that people are going to tweet at us and say like,

14:53.200 --> 14:57.600
listen, I'm usually down with anything, but that prolonged segment where you asked your

14:57.600 --> 15:01.040
brothers what wet dreams they had may have been too much even for me.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.600
What's up you cool babies?

15:03.600 --> 15:09.680
Well, we only have like six boundaries left and it's like sweeps week.

15:09.680 --> 15:10.320
You know what I mean?

15:11.360 --> 15:13.200
We're in the heat of fall pilot season.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.440
We got to compete with the fucking flash somehow.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.120
Tell me about your jizz nightmare.

15:20.160 --> 15:20.640
Tune in this week.

15:20.640 --> 15:21.760
Your jizz odysseys.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.520
Look at fucking utopia.

15:23.520 --> 15:28.000
Utopia is going to be canceled in two weeks and the world will mourn the loss of something

15:28.000 --> 15:29.520
that they never knew that they should love.

15:30.640 --> 15:36.080
We could fall down the same pit if we don't keep it spicy reality show utopia.

15:36.080 --> 15:40.560
I'm talking about the shit reality show utopia that nobody but you and I are watching.

15:40.560 --> 15:41.680
It's amazing, right?

15:41.680 --> 15:42.400
We can't get started.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.400
Okay, I we probably can't go down a utopia rabbit hole, right?

15:46.400 --> 15:47.120
No.

15:47.120 --> 15:51.360
Okay, but did you watch the new episode and aren't they kind of ruining it with confessionals?

15:51.360 --> 15:53.760
Um, I didn't watch this week's episode.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.400
We have a special like topical like timely.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.040
Are you ready?

15:57.040 --> 15:59.360
This year Halloween falls on a Friday.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.840
I'm excited to be able to celebrate the holiday on the weekend.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.760
What the fuck are you doing?

16:03.760 --> 16:04.800
I'm reading a question.

16:04.800 --> 16:05.840
I'm my own man now.

16:05.840 --> 16:06.880
Don't hold me back, dad.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.000
What are you?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.560
You move out to fucking cal now you're hotshot.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.480
L.A. Travis, we love it.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.680
I'm tired of this.

16:13.680 --> 16:18.400
I'm tired of you big timing so you can go to In-N-Out Burger whenever you want.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.880
And I know it's so it's 10 o'clock there.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.160
I'm done with this.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.200
Do you want to go ahead?

16:23.200 --> 16:25.040
Let's hear your L.A. infections.

16:25.040 --> 16:30.160
You take the four or nine to Halloween falls on a Friday.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.240
Californians, you guys remember?

16:32.240 --> 16:32.800
Okay, you ready?

16:33.360 --> 16:37.360
Yeah, I guess I only do one thing on this show, but I guess I'll just slide it over.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.080
This year Halloween falls on a Friday.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.600
I'm excited to be able to celebrate.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.320
No, you.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.040
Okay, you take it.

16:43.920 --> 16:44.800
I don't wanna.

16:44.800 --> 16:45.760
I'm done with that now.

16:45.760 --> 16:46.880
I don't do that anymore.

16:46.880 --> 16:51.040
Now Justin's doing Yahoo's and I just fucking kick it.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.680
This year, Halloween falls on a Friday.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.080
I'm excited to be able to celebrate the holiday on the weekend

16:56.080 --> 16:57.760
as I love dressing up in costumes.

16:57.760 --> 17:02.400
Would it be socially acceptable to go out on Saturday night in costume as well?

17:02.400 --> 17:02.880
Oh, sure.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.400
October, October 32nd.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.120
Sounds good to me.

17:05.680 --> 17:09.600
I don't want the party to end, but I also don't want to be the only person there in costume.

17:09.600 --> 17:10.480
Trick or trouble.

17:10.480 --> 17:11.280
Hey, good news.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.160
You will be.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.440
You will be the only person.

17:13.440 --> 17:14.160
Although, I don't know.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.200
I mean, October 32nd is becoming an increasingly popular day

17:17.200 --> 17:18.400
for people to dress up in costume.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.440
I don't know about you, Griffin.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.880
I didn't understand a fucking word Travis just said.

17:22.880 --> 17:23.600
I didn't understand.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.880
Where was the inflection, the heart, the energy, the passion?

17:26.880 --> 17:31.040
He didn't fuck up reading a word that was three syllables long,

17:32.160 --> 17:33.680
which is, I don't know.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.480
I've just become so accustomed to the sound of your voice, I guess.

17:36.480 --> 17:43.520
There is no day that brings more of a tonal shift to your life.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.560
Maybe January 1st rivals it.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.640
But like, November 1st is such a momentous thing.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.600
It's like, all right, we're done with those bullshit holidays.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.040
Time to get down to that sweet stuff.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.960
The temperature plummets like 30 degrees overnight.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.520
The fall leaves start a falling.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.240
All the pumpkins turn to ash.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.000
And it's like, it's fucking go time.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.360
It's fucking turkey time.

18:05.360 --> 18:06.880
Have you guys, you guys think it's weird?

18:06.880 --> 18:09.280
I was thinking about this for the first time this year.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.760
I have a jack-o'-lantern on my porch now.

18:11.760 --> 18:12.640
I still carve.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.880
It seems like a lot of people aren't into that anymore.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.440
I don't see a lot of those anymore, but I still carve.

18:18.160 --> 18:18.960
And I have it there.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.800
And I was thinking about how I need to get rid of that.

18:20.800 --> 18:25.760
And then I was thinking like, don't pumpkins kind of weirdly straddle the line

18:25.760 --> 18:27.920
between like Halloween and autumnal?

18:27.920 --> 18:30.400
Like, if I turn this bad boy around,

18:30.400 --> 18:33.520
can it just be an autumnal decoration to the rots, of course?

18:33.520 --> 18:36.640
Well, and then it's just like a commentary on life.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.080
Think about it.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.040
Think about it, people.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.280
I get, I get this question because like,

18:41.280 --> 18:44.240
so we'll take 30 seconds to talk about the fact that Griffin

18:44.240 --> 18:47.360
and I both dressed up as Bob Belcher from Bob's Burgers.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.520
What the fuck, by the way, what the fuck?

18:49.520 --> 18:51.520
I'm almost certain I told you that I was doing that before.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.760
No, we haven't spoken in three weeks.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.880
And our wives were both like, no, it was great.

18:56.880 --> 18:57.520
And it was totally cute.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.800
And our friend Bradberry dressed up too.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.240
So we had this weird like, are you?

19:00.240 --> 19:00.880
Yeah, I am.

19:00.880 --> 19:01.440
Did you?

19:01.440 --> 19:01.680
Yeah.

19:01.680 --> 19:02.800
Yeah.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.600
But so I've got a full beard and Bob has a mustache.

19:05.600 --> 19:11.040
So I like debated all day, like, do I shave down for one night?

19:11.040 --> 19:13.440
Like, and it seems like all of this work,

19:13.440 --> 19:14.880
all this money you spend on costumes

19:14.880 --> 19:16.240
and time spending costume together

19:16.240 --> 19:19.440
and everything like that for maybe like six hours

19:19.440 --> 19:21.200
of enjoyment and then you're just done.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.960
Like, it's not a thing like you're investing in

19:22.960 --> 19:24.000
for the rest of the year.

19:24.640 --> 19:25.040
Like you're-

19:25.040 --> 19:25.760
I beg to differ.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.360
I actually bought a wig that I think I'm gonna get

19:27.360 --> 19:29.040
a lot of use out of, sexually.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.600
I didn't mean to say that last word again.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.400
I keep doing that.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.960
I keep adding in the meant to think the last words,

19:34.960 --> 19:36.080
but then I say them out loud.

19:36.080 --> 19:36.720
God damn it.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.480
The mustache too.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.000
God damn it.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.360
I was kind of depressing.

19:41.360 --> 19:45.280
This is the first year in like a long time

19:45.280 --> 19:48.880
that I haven't gotten like a Halloween costume together.

19:48.880 --> 19:52.720
It's always hugely stressful because Sydney and I burned

19:52.720 --> 19:56.400
like Wayne and Garth way too early in our relationship.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.440
And we should have hung on to it for a while longer.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.360
So it's always hard trying to come up with-

20:01.360 --> 20:03.600
Every seven years, you can do the costume over.

20:04.720 --> 20:05.760
You think I can revisit it?

20:05.760 --> 20:06.640
You think it's time?

20:06.640 --> 20:08.240
Yeah, I'm looking forward to five years from now

20:08.240 --> 20:09.760
when I can do Marty McFly again.

20:11.040 --> 20:11.680
We all are.

20:12.320 --> 20:13.440
I thought you were TMNT.

20:14.560 --> 20:18.160
I was, but it was really just a t-shirt and a mask.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.000
I mean, it was fine.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.120
It just wasn't for a party.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.040
Like a lot of times at the Halloween party,

20:23.040 --> 20:24.640
I'm straddling that line between like,

20:24.640 --> 20:26.800
are people gonna get this?

20:26.800 --> 20:29.840
And does it bring-

20:29.840 --> 20:32.240
Do I think it's personally entertaining?

20:32.240 --> 20:34.400
One year I was six string samurai

20:34.400 --> 20:37.280
from that hit indie film, Six Strings Samurai.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.960
And I walked around the neighborhood

20:38.960 --> 20:40.800
in just like a suit with a sword

20:40.800 --> 20:44.160
because that's like the whole bit and nobody got that one.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.760
So that was not a good costume.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.280
I thought that was a failure on my part.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.960
Yeah, I mean, we've all shot the cannon indoors like that.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.320
This was actually the first year I think ever

20:54.320 --> 20:56.560
where I was known for, well, I don't know.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.560
The year the movie Kick-Ass came out,

20:58.560 --> 21:01.600
I bought a Kick-Ass outfit, but it was really tight

21:01.600 --> 21:03.600
and I had to wear jeans underneath it

21:03.600 --> 21:06.080
because my dick was just like,

21:06.080 --> 21:07.760
hey guys, happy Halloween.

21:07.760 --> 21:08.880
Oh, cute costume.

21:08.880 --> 21:09.760
I'm Griffin's dick.

21:10.640 --> 21:13.280
You could see me like I'm just out there

21:13.280 --> 21:15.600
and the mask didn't fit over my giant head.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.040
So I went maskless.

21:17.040 --> 21:20.480
And so I just basically looked like a sex pervert

21:20.480 --> 21:22.800
who was really dumpy from the waist down.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.720
What were we talking about?

21:24.720 --> 21:26.160
I did, I did, I did, yeah.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.240
Speaking of this exact situation,

21:28.240 --> 21:31.040
last year, right around Halloween time,

21:31.040 --> 21:34.080
but it is not a Halloween-related story,

21:34.080 --> 21:36.880
I was directing a production of

21:37.680 --> 21:39.120
It's a Bird that's Playing Superman

21:39.840 --> 21:42.160
and the young man who was playing Superman,

21:42.160 --> 21:44.640
who also is a listener of this program, hi, Drew.

21:45.440 --> 21:46.400
He was-

21:46.400 --> 21:47.600
Drew Davenport?

21:47.600 --> 21:49.360
No, Drew Edwards.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.480
And he was playing Superman

21:52.480 --> 21:54.000
and he was trying to figure out

21:55.920 --> 21:58.480
how the situation down there

21:59.520 --> 22:01.760
needed to be sort of curtailed

22:01.760 --> 22:03.760
or restrained in some way.

22:03.760 --> 22:05.600
And he tried several options

22:06.160 --> 22:08.720
and was asking me for feedback.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.720
And so I was in the unavailable position

22:10.720 --> 22:12.800
of trying to tell a 17-year-old

22:12.800 --> 22:14.480
how much of his dick could be showing.

22:14.480 --> 22:17.840
Did you ask him to describe

22:17.840 --> 22:20.720
his different experiments using ASMR?

22:22.560 --> 22:23.840
You fucking weirdo.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.480
Start again.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.160
Whisper, please.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.560
One of my friends asked me to ask you

22:34.560 --> 22:35.680
what the best solution was.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.040
One of my friends did that.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.480
What was the best solution?

22:38.480 --> 22:40.320
He asked, his name is George.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.560
Some sort of weight belt, I think,

22:42.560 --> 22:43.920
ended up being the thing.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.320
It was like compression shorts

22:46.320 --> 22:47.520
that you do for sports.

22:47.520 --> 22:48.320
Compression shorts.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.560
Was one of the options he had lean into it?

22:51.360 --> 22:51.680
Yeah.

22:52.800 --> 22:53.760
For the moms.

22:53.760 --> 22:56.480
Tuck a few fake dicks down there

22:56.480 --> 22:57.520
and they won't know which ones,

22:58.880 --> 22:59.840
which ones, right?

23:00.640 --> 23:02.240
The old decoy dick.

23:02.240 --> 23:03.680
The old Cthulhu's beard.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.120
You guys want a Yahoo?

23:07.120 --> 23:07.600
Yes, please.

23:08.800 --> 23:12.000
This Yahoo was sent in by level 45,000

23:12.000 --> 23:17.200
Yahoo Answers shaman Drew Davenport.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.000
Thank you, Drew.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kelly 45712 who asks,

23:27.440 --> 23:29.840
what are some cute Halloween names

23:29.840 --> 23:32.720
for spaghetti, French bread, and salad?

23:34.800 --> 23:37.120
What are some cute Halloween names

23:37.120 --> 23:40.880
for spaghetti, French bread, and salad?

23:40.880 --> 23:42.960
Okay, wait, so like she-

23:42.960 --> 23:43.840
I'll give you an example.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.080
This is Yahoo Answers, the best answer,

23:47.120 --> 23:48.960
which I certainly will not debate.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.800
Yahoo Answers user Double says,

23:50.800 --> 23:53.040
for spaghetti, spoo-getty.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.000
That's what I was gonna say.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.000
That's really good.

23:56.000 --> 23:56.560
It's really good.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.680
What about witch's hair?

23:59.680 --> 24:00.800
That's pretty good too.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.000
That's what, are we talking about like,

24:02.000 --> 24:02.880
you're trying to trigger like,

24:02.880 --> 24:03.760
oh, put your hand in there.

24:03.760 --> 24:04.720
It's like, it's our eyeballs.

24:04.720 --> 24:05.200
It's grapes.

24:05.200 --> 24:05.760
What is it?

24:05.760 --> 24:05.920
It's grapes.

24:05.920 --> 24:06.720
It's cool.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.680
It's always grapes.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.800
Some Medusa bush.

24:09.440 --> 24:10.240
That was gross.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.080
I'm sorry I said Medusa bush, everybody.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.000
But you think about it,

24:14.880 --> 24:16.720
there'll probably be snakes down there too, right?

24:17.840 --> 24:18.160
Okay.

24:19.520 --> 24:20.000
No, no, no.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.440
Are you asking me right now?

24:21.440 --> 24:21.680
Yeah.

24:21.680 --> 24:24.000
If Medusa has snakes for hair,

24:25.760 --> 24:27.680
that she would have tiny-

24:27.680 --> 24:30.080
You asked me about my night jizz.

24:31.360 --> 24:34.320
Working on my night jizz.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.080
I'm asking you if Medusa-

24:36.080 --> 24:37.840
Travis, you'll get one later in the show.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.600
Justin, I'm specifically asking you

24:39.600 --> 24:41.200
if Medusa has snakes down there.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.840
If the carpet matches the snakes.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.520
I have always thought of Medusa

24:49.520 --> 24:52.160
as someone who's down to clown 24-7.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.240
I'm assuming she keeps it short.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.240
Maybe just one strip of snakes

24:56.240 --> 24:56.800
or maybe snakes in a-

24:56.800 --> 24:57.760
Just snake blood.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.360
Just one special-

24:59.360 --> 24:59.680
Hi.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.480
Maybe she shapes it into the shape of a plane

25:02.480 --> 25:03.520
and is like, get it?

25:04.240 --> 25:05.360
My name is Dennis.

25:05.360 --> 25:08.800
Dennis, I made the cut, literally.

25:10.560 --> 25:13.360
I'm the one pubic snake who's here every year.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.520
I'm so lonely.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.800
French bread, double says,

25:18.800 --> 25:20.800
could be dead man's finger

25:20.800 --> 25:22.880
or dead man's finger slices.

25:22.880 --> 25:23.120
Not as good as-

25:23.120 --> 25:24.480
It's too small for a finger.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.560
It's more like a butt cheek that you cut off.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.720
Maybe like a toasted butt cheek.

25:28.720 --> 25:29.760
Dead man's loafer.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.000
Cut a man's butt cheek off

25:32.000 --> 25:34.080
and this is the butt cheek I toasted it.

25:34.080 --> 25:35.680
Scarlet keys, Italian.

25:35.680 --> 25:39.600
What if you called the French bread salad?

25:40.400 --> 25:43.200
Cause that's spookier than bread is, I think.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.480
Pretty good joke, Bazooka Joe.

25:46.240 --> 25:46.960
Keep them coming.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.440
What would the salad be then?

25:49.440 --> 25:50.880
Cause what's worse than-

25:50.880 --> 25:51.920
A spooky salad?

25:53.200 --> 25:54.960
It's pretty good, I guess.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.640
I mean, no, that wasn't my intent.

25:56.640 --> 25:57.440
I'm just clarifying.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.960
You mean a spooky name for a salad.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.360
You just called it a salad with scare-its.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.040
I like that.

26:03.040 --> 26:03.840
Tom Scare-its?

26:03.840 --> 26:07.120
Tom Scare-its.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.680
What about with thousand dylan dressing?

26:12.720 --> 26:13.600
And blue cheese.

26:16.240 --> 26:17.680
Wait, did you say boochies?

26:17.680 --> 26:18.800
Boochies, boochies.

26:18.800 --> 26:19.760
Obviously, boochies.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.280
Boochies, I meant boochies.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.560
Boochies, of course, boochies.

26:23.760 --> 26:24.800
So we got the money zone?

26:24.800 --> 26:37.920
I think so, actually.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.360
You guys have heard of TV, right?

26:40.320 --> 26:40.880
Wait, what?

26:41.760 --> 26:42.960
Have you guys heard of TV?

26:42.960 --> 26:45.200
Like the shows episodic in nature.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.400
Like tuberculosis?

26:46.400 --> 26:48.320
No, like short movies, TV.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.480
I guess so.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.840
I got something better than TV.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.280
TV sucks, it's for old people.

26:54.000 --> 26:54.240
Whoa.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.760
You just found out TV existed.

26:55.760 --> 26:56.160
Hold on.

26:56.160 --> 26:58.080
Yeah, can you fucking slow your roll?

26:58.080 --> 26:59.760
Sorry, I let it go already.

26:59.760 --> 27:03.280
TV's last gen and next is Hulu.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.360
But Hulu, you guys remember Hulu?

27:09.120 --> 27:11.360
Forget Hulu, because now there's Hulu Plus.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.680
God, you're asking us to forget a lot of shit right now

27:13.680 --> 27:15.600
that we literally just heard about.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.280
It is an internet streaming service.

27:17.280 --> 27:18.560
It's got all the current season episodes

27:18.560 --> 27:20.080
of favorite shows like Modern Family,

27:20.080 --> 27:21.200
The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,

27:21.200 --> 27:24.240
and every episode of some shows like South Park,

27:25.520 --> 27:27.360
which is just in Hulu Plus.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.920
If you want to get that whole South Park canon,

27:29.920 --> 27:30.880
that's the place to get it.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.080
Now that you've brought up Hulu,

27:32.080 --> 27:35.040
and I've done research on it in the last 0.5 seconds,

27:35.040 --> 27:38.080
they also have lots of originals and exclusive content.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.920
So the second season of East List High,

27:41.920 --> 27:44.080
which season one and two are up,

27:44.080 --> 27:46.080
so that's like a full two days, you're welcome.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.920
You can also watch The Hot Wives of Orlando,

27:49.920 --> 27:51.600
which is a parody of The Real Hot Wives,

27:51.600 --> 27:53.760
starring Kacey Wilson, Kristen Schaal,

27:53.760 --> 27:55.920
Angela, like pretty much the greatest.

27:55.920 --> 27:59.040
Angela Kinsey, it's an amazing cast.

27:59.040 --> 28:02.640
They just added all three seasons of Burning Love,

28:02.640 --> 28:05.840
which is fucking the best and funniest show on television.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.520
You should definitely be watching that.

28:07.520 --> 28:11.840
Also, ANTM Cycle 21, Boys Still in the House, Booch Tooch.

28:11.840 --> 28:13.360
Boys are not out of the house.

28:13.360 --> 28:16.000
Boys, they cannot evict these boys.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.200
They can, however, put all of the contestants

28:19.200 --> 28:22.400
in a haunted asylum and take pictures of them

28:22.400 --> 28:25.440
while people chase them with chainsaws and knives and shit.

28:26.320 --> 28:29.840
Quick diversion to just wag my finger

28:29.840 --> 28:31.760
at the producers of ANTM.

28:31.760 --> 28:33.520
Some of us plan our weeks around it,

28:33.520 --> 28:36.160
so when you drop a recap special,

28:36.160 --> 28:39.520
and I have set an hour of my Friday night aside

28:39.520 --> 28:42.400
for your program, not cool.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.960
And when you fucking tease the week before

28:44.960 --> 28:47.280
at the end of the episode that the next week's episode

28:47.280 --> 28:49.120
is gonna be a very, very special episode

28:49.120 --> 28:51.760
where they tackle Adam's unsafe drinking,

28:52.560 --> 28:55.520
and then you follow that up with a fucking recap.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.680
I'm on ANTM recap, the only thing I can assume

28:59.680 --> 29:03.360
is that one of the contestants they expected to die did not.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.000
They budget for one to die every year,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
and it did not come to fruition.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.720
I mean, they did get that one guy out who left.

29:10.720 --> 29:13.600
And I said, you know what, I said good riddance.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.280
I think we all know what guy I'm talking about,

29:15.280 --> 29:17.840
and his behavior was unacceptable.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.360
I do not accept it.

29:19.360 --> 29:20.400
Get the fuck out of here.

29:20.400 --> 29:21.520
Oh wait, you're already gone,

29:21.520 --> 29:23.520
because you're a fucking joker.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.680
For $8 a month, you could be having conversations

29:25.680 --> 29:27.680
just like this, but you don't have to pony up

29:27.680 --> 29:28.560
that eight bucks right now.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.440
No, we're gonna give you a two week free trial of Hulu Plus.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.440
Go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother,

29:33.440 --> 29:36.000
that's all one word, HuluPlus.com slash my brother

29:36.000 --> 29:38.960
and get two weeks free of Hulu Plus, go.

29:39.920 --> 29:41.360
Tucking myself out with advertising.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.840
Can I just say one last thing on the subject though?

29:43.840 --> 29:46.160
Yeah, can you make it snack related?

29:46.160 --> 29:49.520
Just really quick, I thought that that dude's beard weave

29:49.520 --> 29:50.560
was looking a lot better.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.360
I'm not, that's not a joke.

29:53.360 --> 29:54.640
It started to look a lot more natural.

29:54.640 --> 29:57.120
I don't know what fucking witchcraft they used.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.560
I too thought Denzel's beard weave

29:58.560 --> 29:59.920
was starting to look better.

29:59.920 --> 30:02.080
Two words, people, beard weave.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.000
Two more words, free snacks.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.720
We're gonna give you free snacks from Nature Box.

30:06.720 --> 30:11.280
Those are delicious snacks that are wholesome.

30:11.280 --> 30:14.880
Snacks that don't have a lot of weird stuff.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.200
Powering has come and gone.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.760
You've eaten your fun sized candy bars,

30:19.760 --> 30:23.280
your Nerds, your Nerd ropes, your Nerd chains,

30:23.920 --> 30:26.480
your Tootsie Roll Pops of all flavors.

30:26.480 --> 30:27.600
Time to purify.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.440
These snacks have no artificial flavors

30:29.440 --> 30:30.560
or colors or sweeteners.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.240
There's no trans fat.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.680
There's no high for dose corn syrup.

30:33.680 --> 30:34.320
They're wholesome.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.800
You can feel good about giving them to your family

30:36.800 --> 30:38.320
or to trick or treaters, loose.

30:38.320 --> 30:39.760
Give them a handful.

30:39.760 --> 30:43.360
Give them a handful of loose choco nom noms.

30:43.360 --> 30:45.360
A handful of loose dark cocoa almonds

30:45.360 --> 30:47.520
or loose mix sweet potato fries

30:47.520 --> 30:49.040
or loose peanut butter nom noms

30:49.040 --> 30:50.960
maybe slightly warmed from sitting

30:50.960 --> 30:52.240
in the palm of your hand.

30:52.240 --> 30:55.040
We got sweet and savory and spicy snacks.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.880
We ran out of Halloween candy this year

30:56.880 --> 30:58.480
because we completely under,

30:58.480 --> 31:00.880
it's our first year Halloween in this new house

31:00.880 --> 31:01.920
and we totally underestimated

31:01.920 --> 31:03.040
how many trick or treats were gonna come.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.160
We ran out of candy.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.800
And so we started handing out these rice crackers

31:06.800 --> 31:08.160
that we brought back from Japan.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.000
Like enjoy kids, you're gonna have

31:10.000 --> 31:11.920
a real multicultural experience.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.680
You're welcome from the McElroy's.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.480
So you can get a free box of these snacks

31:16.480 --> 31:18.480
and really get in there and try them out.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.440
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother

31:21.440 --> 31:25.760
and you'll get a free trial box of delicious snacks.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.840
Stay full, stay strong.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.280
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother

31:29.280 --> 31:31.040
to get a free trial of delicious snacks.

31:32.560 --> 31:36.720
Here is a message for Cory from Julia,

31:36.720 --> 31:39.360
Tim, Imo, Kate, Trevor, Robert, Elijah,

31:39.360 --> 31:43.680
Lydia, Jason, Mari, Will, Katie, Gary,

31:43.680 --> 31:45.680
Evan, Cole and Ev.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.280
They may have run out of space

31:47.280 --> 31:49.120
but I'm assuming there's another one.

31:49.120 --> 31:52.560
Okay, here's the message for Cory.

31:52.560 --> 31:53.680
Happy birthday, Cory.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.360
Bazinga, you motherfuckers.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.320
I think that's trademarked.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.200
We're gonna go to prison.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.600
We couldn't, Bazinga.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.320
But June Joes, we couldn't afford

32:04.320 --> 32:06.480
that adult teen baby costume you wanted.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.320
So we got you the next best thing.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.320
You're our favorite Cali boy

32:10.320 --> 32:12.560
whose sexy swag will take him far.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.440
We know you've gotta go fast

32:15.440 --> 32:17.200
so we'll keep this short.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.800
Grab yourself a boat drink

32:18.800 --> 32:21.600
and give Buckaroo some of your fuzzy hugs.

32:21.600 --> 32:26.240
Love ya, sad and grossest voice, Sugarloaf.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.680
Oh, see, I thought it was gonna go more

32:27.680 --> 32:29.840
like the direction of the dude from Men in Black.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.200
I have a second message here

32:33.200 --> 32:35.040
and this one's from Cory

32:35.040 --> 32:36.800
and it's just from Buckaroo.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.120
And Buckaroo says, that's right.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.040
We love you so much.

32:41.760 --> 32:45.920
We got you two messages from the brothers McElroy.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.600
We got your back through thick and thin

32:48.160 --> 32:50.160
through this entire commercial break, apparently.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.920
From your woodworking to your cooking,

32:51.920 --> 32:52.960
you've given us a lot.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.760
So here's to you, m'lady, tip, tip, tip.

32:55.760 --> 32:58.160
May the, I don't know what any of this means.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.200
I'm just hanging in there.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.640
May the rest of your year be filled

33:00.640 --> 33:03.920
with primo goofs, dog kisses, and good times.

33:03.920 --> 33:07.040
And don't forget, Shrek is love, Shrek is life.

33:07.040 --> 33:07.840
All hail Shrek.

33:08.480 --> 33:09.280
All hail Shrek.

33:09.840 --> 33:10.400
Thank you, Shrek.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.000
Oh man, that's fantastic.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.680
What a lucky boy that Cory is.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.280
Probably the luckiest.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.040
Can I just say one thing?

33:17.040 --> 33:23.360
I do wonder how Buckaroo got their own message

33:23.360 --> 33:25.760
while Julia, Tim, Emil, Kate, Trevor, Robert, Elijah,

33:25.760 --> 33:28.720
Lydia, Jason, Mari, Will, Katie, Gary, Evan, Cole, and Ev

33:28.720 --> 33:31.600
had to go fucking splitsies like 14 ways

33:31.600 --> 33:33.840
on the first one.

33:33.840 --> 33:37.200
Yeah, pretty hard to figure that one out.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.280
Unless Buckaroo is their hive mind name,

33:39.280 --> 33:41.680
in which case that's pretty sexy.

33:42.240 --> 33:43.520
We are Buckaroo.

33:43.520 --> 33:44.720
We are all Buckaroo.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.120
I am Buckaroo.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.200
I'm gonna force Buckaroo into some sheep

33:49.200 --> 33:50.240
and make him run off a cliff.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.400
What's up?

33:56.400 --> 34:00.400
My name is Jasper Redd, co-host of The Goose Down,

34:00.400 --> 34:02.880
along with the lovely Kimberly Clark,

34:02.880 --> 34:05.840
and we want to invite you into the comfort and groove

34:05.840 --> 34:10.160
of our podcast that encompasses the arts and entertainment.

34:10.160 --> 34:13.200
You can check us out at MaximalFun.org,

34:13.200 --> 34:15.760
also available on iTunes.

34:15.760 --> 34:16.260
See ya.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.720
My brother is older than me by nine years,

34:20.720 --> 34:23.760
and he has been my role model since I can remember,

34:23.760 --> 34:25.840
as is typically the case with an older sibling.

34:25.840 --> 34:26.880
He's a firefighter.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.720
He was briefly a pro kayaker.

34:28.720 --> 34:29.520
He's a carpenter.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.360
I'm feeling inferior as I read this.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.120
He saved a dog from drowning.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.200
He basically matches all the criteria

34:35.200 --> 34:36.560
for being a true American hero,

34:36.560 --> 34:38.880
except he told me yesterday after talking on the phone

34:38.880 --> 34:40.880
that he's recently started sitting down to pee.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.880
His reasoning is it's more sanitary

34:44.880 --> 34:46.640
and you get to relax for a few seconds.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.800
Should I still look up to him,

34:48.800 --> 34:50.560
although I can't help but picture him

34:50.560 --> 34:52.240
sitting on the toilet to number one?

34:52.240 --> 34:54.720
Will this new image I have of him pass?

34:54.720 --> 34:56.080
Should I be concerned?

34:56.080 --> 35:01.040
That's from Standing Strong in Columbus.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.320
While in Japan,

35:03.680 --> 35:07.120
I sat down for every number, for any number,

35:07.120 --> 35:09.040
because them turlets do some really great shit.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.760
You can get a soothing spray,

35:14.480 --> 35:18.960
which I always felt a very silent judgment from my wife

35:18.960 --> 35:20.640
every time that I exercised that option,

35:20.640 --> 35:23.920
because you know no door is thick enough

35:23.920 --> 35:25.600
to keep that sound out.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.080
That's true.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.520
That's a very specific noise.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.040
It's a very specific noise.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.720
There's a motor involved,

35:32.160 --> 35:33.680
but there's also deodorizers.

35:33.680 --> 35:34.720
There's all kinds of great stuff

35:34.720 --> 35:35.680
that you can get down there.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.040
It's a wonderful device.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.200
And I gotta say, I kinda dug it, kinda liked it.

35:39.200 --> 35:41.840
There's very little guesswork involved.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.960
There's very little triangulation that you gotta do.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.440
If anyone else was in a career

35:51.440 --> 35:56.400
where they had to target something,

35:56.400 --> 36:00.240
if you had cut your finger as a chef

36:00.880 --> 36:04.560
as many times as I have been caught peeing on the floor,

36:05.120 --> 36:08.080
you would have lost your privileges by this point.

36:08.080 --> 36:12.480
I have almost certainly lost my right to stand up to pee.

36:12.480 --> 36:14.320
I think I've abused that privilege

36:15.600 --> 36:18.160
to a point that is beyond the pale.

36:18.160 --> 36:20.400
I feel like it's a weird stigma to be like,

36:20.400 --> 36:21.440
oh, you sit down?

36:21.440 --> 36:23.520
It's like, yeah, why?

36:24.320 --> 36:24.880
Why is that?

36:24.880 --> 36:29.600
I have a question for our question asker.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.480
How did that conversation come up?

36:32.480 --> 36:33.840
Do you record a podcast?

36:33.840 --> 36:34.800
Because that's the only reason

36:34.800 --> 36:36.240
I talk about peeing with my brother.

36:36.960 --> 36:37.680
Hey, how was your day?

36:37.680 --> 36:38.320
It was pretty great.

36:38.320 --> 36:39.440
I went grocery shopping.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.520
Did you stand up or sit down when you peed today?

36:42.880 --> 36:46.080
I'm pretty sure that the person didn't mean

36:46.080 --> 36:47.360
to phrase it this way,

36:47.360 --> 36:50.800
but he told me yesterday after talking on the phone.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.040
I know they meant that they learned this

36:53.040 --> 36:53.840
while talking on the phone,

36:53.840 --> 36:55.600
but I like to imagine they mean literally

36:55.600 --> 36:56.560
after talking on the phone,

36:56.560 --> 36:59.200
the brother was like, oh, oh, oh, facts coming in.

37:00.800 --> 37:01.520
Check the facts.

37:04.160 --> 37:05.440
One more addendum.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.440
I always sit down to have wet dreams.

37:07.440 --> 37:08.160
That's not true.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.120
Do you guys want Yahoo?

37:10.400 --> 37:10.900
Yes.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.400
This Yahoo was sent in by Jacob Blocker.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.520
Thank you, Jacob Blocker.

37:15.520 --> 37:19.040
It's by Yahoo Answers user Heartbroken Kid.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.040
Aw, jeez.

37:22.160 --> 37:26.640
Heartbroken Kid asks in the etiquette subcategory,

37:27.920 --> 37:29.600
flushing food in the toilet?

37:31.200 --> 37:34.080
So my boyfriend was raised to flush food down the toilet,

37:34.080 --> 37:35.360
and of course I wasn't.

37:36.560 --> 37:37.600
I told him.

37:38.640 --> 37:40.640
Sounds like your parents are doing some A-B testing.

37:41.840 --> 37:44.720
I told him I do not approve of flushing food

37:44.720 --> 37:47.040
and I do not approve of that

37:47.040 --> 37:49.840
and all the reasons why it is wrong and not safe,

37:49.840 --> 37:52.000
but he continues to argue with me about it.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.840
I told him if we move in together,

37:53.840 --> 37:55.440
I do not want that going on

37:55.440 --> 37:58.480
and says it's our place, I'm allowed to,

37:58.480 --> 37:59.840
and I don't care.

37:59.840 --> 38:00.640
What should I do?

38:00.640 --> 38:03.600
I told him, Will, with all the petty stuff

38:03.600 --> 38:06.720
I put up with you, you can't do that simple task.

38:06.720 --> 38:09.520
Yes, I know, actually researching people do this,

38:09.520 --> 38:10.720
but he is the first I met.

38:10.720 --> 38:15.720
Gross as bad as what's already going on in the toilet.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.040
That's debatable.

38:17.040 --> 38:19.200
You don't know what I'm capable of in there.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.760
Sometimes when we do these Yahoo Answers,

38:23.600 --> 38:27.600
I upset myself because I don't just disregard it

38:27.600 --> 38:29.840
immediately, I sit there and go, well, hold on.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.960
Are we talking about such and such or such and such?

38:31.960 --> 38:33.720
So I'm listening to this question saying,

38:33.720 --> 38:36.160
are you talking about he finishes eating

38:36.160 --> 38:37.800
and there's some leftovers on the plate

38:37.800 --> 38:39.840
and rather than go to the kitchen,

38:39.840 --> 38:40.920
he walks into the bathroom

38:40.920 --> 38:42.640
and scrapes his plate in the toilet?

38:42.640 --> 38:43.480
Or are you talking about like,

38:43.480 --> 38:46.160
oh, he dropped some goldfish crackers on the ground

38:46.160 --> 38:47.840
and rather than go to a trashcan,

38:47.840 --> 38:49.680
he was next to the toilet and just threw them away?

38:49.680 --> 38:53.880
I just Googled it as a thing, guys.

38:53.880 --> 38:55.840
I'm reading a blog post now called

38:55.840 --> 38:58.920
A Case for Not Throwing Food in the Toilet.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.520
Why do we need a case?

39:00.520 --> 39:03.280
Why do we have to get fucking litigious

39:03.280 --> 39:04.200
about this thing?

39:04.200 --> 39:06.840
It's against God's law.

39:06.840 --> 39:09.880
So wait, Griffin, I hate to ask you

39:09.880 --> 39:11.320
to sacrifice yourself like this,

39:11.320 --> 39:14.440
but tell me more about what you found from Google.

39:14.440 --> 39:15.880
Here's an argument for a case

39:15.880 --> 39:17.600
for not flushing food in the toilet.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.960
Flushing food creates clogs.

39:19.960 --> 39:24.880
Yeah, dog, when you put your fucking heaps of spaghetti

39:24.880 --> 39:27.440
in the toilet, it's not gonna work anymore

39:27.440 --> 39:29.440
because it's not a garbage disposal, it's a toilet.

39:29.440 --> 39:33.160
You also run a terrible risk of flushing food

39:33.160 --> 39:34.600
down the toilet, walking out of the room,

39:34.600 --> 39:35.640
it doesn't flush properly.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.760
You come back in two hours later and think,

39:37.760 --> 39:39.680
what the fuck did I do?

39:39.680 --> 39:42.960
What in the whole fuck is stains full of dude fingers?

39:42.960 --> 39:44.640
I have done that before with,

39:44.640 --> 39:48.560
I'll empty out the last of a Coke or something

39:48.560 --> 39:51.200
down into the toilet while I'm cleaning up,

39:51.200 --> 39:52.920
and I won't flush it because that seems like a waste,

39:52.920 --> 39:53.920
it's not pee-pee or anything,

39:53.920 --> 39:55.420
and then I'll come back in an hour and think,

39:55.420 --> 39:59.000
oh my God, what has happened to me?

39:59.000 --> 40:00.480
Do you think that that's a gateway drug

40:00.480 --> 40:02.160
to putting food in the toilet, Justin?

40:02.160 --> 40:04.400
It might be the first step, so yes,

40:04.400 --> 40:06.280
in terms of what a gateway drug is.

40:06.280 --> 40:11.200
I also have to call out, on Friday I went to use

40:11.200 --> 40:16.200
the bathroom and saw a giganto thing of hair

40:17.640 --> 40:19.820
that had been pulled from the hairbrush

40:19.820 --> 40:22.760
that my wife had tossed into the toilet

40:22.760 --> 40:27.760
and not the trash can, which is right next to that option.

40:28.480 --> 40:31.160
She had one thing that can definitely clog

40:31.160 --> 40:33.680
if you put enough hair in it, and then a trash can,

40:33.680 --> 40:35.920
and she went for the thing that you could definitely clog,

40:35.920 --> 40:38.600
so I had to get into the pee water to fish the hair out

40:38.600 --> 40:40.000
to put in the trash can,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.400
because I can't afford a plumber right now, I got a baby.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.880
My name's Dave Barry.

40:43.880 --> 40:45.600
Yeah, Jesus Christ.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.640
Thanks.

40:46.640 --> 40:49.700
I've been Ray Romano, this has been my stand-up comedy

40:49.700 --> 40:52.000
podcast mid-everbody loves, Raymond.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.040
I guess I just don't understand,

40:56.040 --> 40:58.040
unless you're eating in the bathroom,

40:58.040 --> 40:59.760
why is this morgan, why is...

40:59.760 --> 41:02.020
Nop, nop, nop, done, bloosh.

41:02.020 --> 41:04.740
Is that what you're saying?

41:04.740 --> 41:07.540
I couldn't possibly, I'm stuffed,

41:07.540 --> 41:09.540
I couldn't possibly sploosh.

41:09.540 --> 41:12.840
I can't understand why you sit there and go,

41:12.840 --> 41:16.860
I know this is the best option, this is what I wanna do,

41:16.860 --> 41:18.240
to the point where your girlfriend says like,

41:18.240 --> 41:20.380
hey, when we move in together, don't do that anymore,

41:20.380 --> 41:22.860
and he's like, don't try to change me.

41:22.860 --> 41:25.740
I mean, what's the fucking, what is the fucking argument?

41:25.740 --> 41:28.340
I pay rent here too, and if I wanna put my leftover steak

41:28.340 --> 41:29.820
in the toilet, I will.

41:29.820 --> 41:32.460
The craziest thing here is the pushback, really,

41:32.460 --> 41:34.460
because I think we're all waiting to get busted

41:34.460 --> 41:35.940
for whatever we're doing in the bathroom.

41:35.940 --> 41:38.220
We're all assuming that we're doing it wrong anyway,

41:38.220 --> 41:40.760
and if someone calls us on any specific thing,

41:40.760 --> 41:42.460
we will instantly change.

41:42.460 --> 41:44.180
If someone kicked in the door like,

41:44.180 --> 41:45.560
no, you're supposed to wipe side to side,

41:45.560 --> 41:49.400
I'd be like, fuck, 27 years I've been doing this wrong.

41:49.400 --> 41:50.300
God damn.

41:50.300 --> 41:53.220
I like that there's a part of this Yahoo Answers question

41:53.220 --> 41:56.900
that's like, and with everything else I've put up with,

41:56.900 --> 42:00.180
I ask for this one thing and get pushback.

42:00.180 --> 42:02.040
What else is this guy doing

42:02.040 --> 42:04.080
that this is the minor petty thing?

42:04.080 --> 42:06.420
He's cheated on me 96 times.

42:06.420 --> 42:09.620
He sold my dog for weed money.

42:09.620 --> 42:10.460
That's cool.

42:10.460 --> 42:11.740
I've made my peace with that.

42:11.740 --> 42:13.540
He sold my dog for dog money?

42:13.540 --> 42:15.580
He sold my weed for dog money

42:16.500 --> 42:17.940
and did not make a clean profit.

42:17.940 --> 42:20.100
Just stop putting Nabisco brand vanilla wafers

42:20.100 --> 42:23.220
into the toilet, that's all I'm asking.

42:23.220 --> 42:25.660
My girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year now.

42:25.660 --> 42:27.460
Things are going great, but there's one issue

42:27.460 --> 42:29.820
that people keep bringing up to me.

42:29.820 --> 42:31.740
Only about three photos of myself

42:31.740 --> 42:34.000
and my girlfriend together currently exist.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.820
We just aren't big picture people

42:35.820 --> 42:38.540
and I don't even have a decent photo capable,

42:38.540 --> 42:42.300
decent photo capable camera or phone readily available.

42:42.300 --> 42:43.860
Should we be taking more photographs?

42:43.860 --> 42:46.460
I'm gonna assume they meant photo capable phone

42:46.460 --> 42:48.860
as opposed to a photo capable camera

42:48.860 --> 42:51.420
because I think that's pretty high on the list.

42:51.420 --> 42:52.660
I also wanna say you could probably

42:52.660 --> 42:54.580
have just a decent camera.

42:54.580 --> 42:55.420
Is this a camera?

42:55.420 --> 42:56.260
I'll get you, but anyway.

42:56.260 --> 43:00.020
Is a decent camera or photo capable phone readily available?

43:00.020 --> 43:02.140
Should we be taking more photographic evidence

43:02.140 --> 43:03.980
of our relationship's continued existence

43:03.980 --> 43:06.060
or am I getting worried over nothing?

43:06.060 --> 43:07.660
Pictureless in Pennsylvania.

43:08.860 --> 43:10.820
This is actually something I've been thinking about a lot

43:10.820 --> 43:12.700
with like the baby I've been taking.

43:12.700 --> 43:13.660
I don't know how many pictures

43:13.660 --> 43:14.820
you're supposed to take of your baby.

43:14.820 --> 43:16.960
I take a lot of pictures of my baby,

43:16.960 --> 43:19.500
but a lot of times recently I've been thinking

43:19.500 --> 43:21.460
about like stuff will show her as she gets older

43:21.460 --> 43:25.060
and like I don't have any pictures for my honeymoon,

43:25.060 --> 43:25.900
I don't think.

43:25.900 --> 43:27.580
Like I don't think we took any pictures.

43:27.580 --> 43:30.020
Here's the thing, it's also like Teresa and I,

43:30.020 --> 43:33.380
until we got married, there were only in existence

43:33.380 --> 43:36.820
like two printed out photos of us.

43:36.820 --> 43:40.100
And I think what it is is we live together

43:40.100 --> 43:43.060
and we've lived together for almost our entire relationship

43:43.060 --> 43:45.140
and like we see each other every day

43:45.140 --> 43:49.340
so it just never occurs to me like there's no photos of us

43:49.340 --> 43:51.420
because we're like together.

43:51.420 --> 43:54.500
But like my friends that like live all over the country,

43:54.500 --> 43:57.100
then I sit there and go, ah, it's nice to look

43:57.100 --> 43:58.900
on this picture of my brother so I don't see every day

43:58.900 --> 44:00.380
or my friend Justin who I don't see every day,

44:00.380 --> 44:01.220
my friend, you know.

44:01.220 --> 44:03.020
Do you look at a picture of us every day and just like?

44:03.020 --> 44:05.300
I have a picture of you two right by the front door

44:05.300 --> 44:07.500
so that every time I leave the house, I think about you guys.

44:07.500 --> 44:08.740
You just look and you think,

44:08.740 --> 44:10.140
you just think your thoughts about us?

44:10.140 --> 44:10.980
Yeah.

44:10.980 --> 44:11.800
What picture is it, Jeff?

44:11.800 --> 44:13.580
It's the you and Griffin, I think on like a subway

44:13.580 --> 44:15.940
or something and some kind of train together.

44:16.900 --> 44:17.940
And like you're leaning forward

44:17.940 --> 44:19.380
and it's a very cute picture of both of you

44:19.380 --> 44:22.100
and I look at it and I kiss it as I walk out.

44:22.100 --> 44:23.420
And I see like. Where do you kiss it?

44:23.420 --> 44:24.540
I kiss it square on the face.

44:24.540 --> 44:25.620
Slow down.

44:25.620 --> 44:26.740
Okay, both of you.

44:26.740 --> 44:27.580
I will.

44:27.580 --> 44:29.100
ASMR, ASMR, please.

44:29.100 --> 44:31.340
I kiss both of you on the face and I take turns

44:31.340 --> 44:33.380
as who's gonna be the first one each time I do it

44:33.380 --> 44:34.220
and then when I come.

44:34.220 --> 44:35.540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

44:35.540 --> 44:36.380
You're welcome.

44:36.380 --> 44:37.220
And then I come home and say,

44:37.220 --> 44:38.740
I'm sorry I let you down again.

44:38.740 --> 44:41.940
I'll get him next time, I'll get him next time.

44:41.940 --> 44:43.260
Tomorrow for sure.

44:45.460 --> 44:47.780
And when I say leave the house, I walk down to the corner

44:47.780 --> 44:49.780
and just stand there for 30 seconds and walk back

44:49.780 --> 44:52.100
so you guys will think I'm trying to do something out here.

44:52.100 --> 44:54.420
Anybody wanna put me in a movie?

44:54.420 --> 44:55.740
Tomorrow for sure.

44:55.740 --> 44:58.860
There hasn't been a single movie filming on my block yet.

44:58.860 --> 45:00.100
We love it.

45:00.100 --> 45:00.940
But I'll get it.

45:00.940 --> 45:02.620
I'll get it for you guys.

45:02.620 --> 45:04.260
I'm not talking to you.

45:04.260 --> 45:06.500
Griffin, do you know that I tried to get Travis.

45:06.500 --> 45:09.460
I tried to get Travis to go to Utopia

45:09.460 --> 45:10.860
so he could be on that show.

45:10.860 --> 45:13.360
Oh, fuck, Travis, you would have been great.

45:13.360 --> 45:14.200
You gotta.

45:14.200 --> 45:15.340
You can visit.

45:15.340 --> 45:16.180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:16.180 --> 45:18.300
You can visit Utopia and here's the thing about you.

45:18.300 --> 45:19.140
Okay.

45:19.140 --> 45:21.460
We can't, we can't, we keep teetering on the edge.

45:21.460 --> 45:23.460
Quick, super quick.

45:23.460 --> 45:25.740
Utopia is a reality TV show about people trying

45:25.740 --> 45:26.940
to forge a new community together.

45:26.940 --> 45:28.220
It's amazing.

45:28.220 --> 45:30.620
But they let people visit, right?

45:30.620 --> 45:33.380
And they film it because they're filming 24 hours a day.

45:33.380 --> 45:35.740
This is a situation that is bizarre to me

45:35.740 --> 45:38.740
because people have come in and inserted themselves

45:38.740 --> 45:40.580
into the romantic lives of these people.

45:40.580 --> 45:42.100
There's a gentleman who's a beekeeper

45:42.100 --> 45:43.700
who just came to sell them some bees

45:43.700 --> 45:45.540
and ended up on the show.

45:45.540 --> 45:47.940
And this seems very treacherous to me in California

45:47.940 --> 45:49.300
where people could drive it from LA

45:49.300 --> 45:51.220
and if you are crazy enough

45:51.220 --> 45:54.500
and if you do something noteworthy,

45:54.500 --> 45:56.180
you will end up in the TV show.

45:56.180 --> 45:58.340
That seems irresistible.

45:58.340 --> 46:00.540
I don't understand why there aren't more people

46:00.540 --> 46:03.060
just getting buck wild in that place.

46:03.060 --> 46:04.420
Yeah, I imagine the waiting list has to be

46:04.420 --> 46:05.980
pretty long at this point.

46:05.980 --> 46:08.380
How many pictures, okay, but see,

46:08.380 --> 46:12.580
the other side of this is what if you walked

46:12.580 --> 46:16.540
into someone's house and they just had 30 pictures

46:16.540 --> 46:18.500
of themselves and their partner

46:18.500 --> 46:20.620
just as soon as you walked in the door

46:20.620 --> 46:22.860
and they were all from different poses

46:22.860 --> 46:24.460
and different outfits and they're like,

46:24.460 --> 46:26.420
this is our documented love.

46:26.420 --> 46:27.500
Well, nobody has that.

46:27.500 --> 46:28.340
That's what I'm saying.

46:28.340 --> 46:30.300
So how many pictures do you need?

46:31.660 --> 46:34.420
I say that if you're in a long-term committed relationship,

46:34.420 --> 46:36.540
you've been dating for about a year now,

46:36.540 --> 46:39.300
you're fine because the next thing that happens,

46:39.300 --> 46:41.340
I mean, really, not to freak you guys out,

46:41.340 --> 46:43.660
is you get married and then they document

46:43.660 --> 46:46.740
the fuck out of it and then you're good forever.

46:46.740 --> 46:50.580
That's it, you super get that one.

46:50.580 --> 46:51.420
Yeah.

46:51.420 --> 46:54.100
Like you super definitely 100% get that one.

46:54.100 --> 46:57.140
To the point where it is weird if you don't.

46:57.140 --> 46:59.500
Like people will comment if you don't document

46:59.500 --> 47:00.780
the shit out of your wedding.

47:00.780 --> 47:01.820
So it's like, okay, great.

47:01.820 --> 47:04.500
Now, Teresa and I went from having two pictures of us

47:04.500 --> 47:05.820
to having like 200 pictures of us.

47:05.820 --> 47:06.700
A billion.

47:06.700 --> 47:08.220
And it's like, okay, we're good.

47:08.220 --> 47:09.940
I actually keep a reserve of those

47:09.940 --> 47:11.260
that you guys have not seen.

47:11.260 --> 47:12.780
And every like five years or so,

47:12.780 --> 47:15.220
I'll drop another 20 and we'll all remember,

47:15.220 --> 47:16.140
we'll all talk about it.

47:16.140 --> 47:17.860
Oh, it's so cold, but the food was so great.

47:17.860 --> 47:20.340
It was the most beautiful wedding I went to that year.

47:20.340 --> 47:23.140
Well, I mean, yeah.

47:23.140 --> 47:25.460
There were other weddings that you ever saw were notable.

47:25.460 --> 47:28.380
Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

47:28.380 --> 47:29.420
I think it's a tricky problem

47:29.420 --> 47:32.580
because it's not something that you can do anything about.

47:32.580 --> 47:34.500
Other people have to take the pictures of you.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.420
You cannot, you can't.

47:36.420 --> 47:37.500
We just got back from our honeymoon.

47:37.500 --> 47:38.900
We took almost no pictures.

47:38.900 --> 47:40.780
I mean, we didn't take pictures of ourselves at all.

47:40.780 --> 47:41.940
We had to get other people to do it.

47:41.940 --> 47:44.820
It was occasionally incredibly awkward

47:44.820 --> 47:46.860
because once we climbed to the top of a mountain

47:46.860 --> 47:49.100
and asked a gentleman we did not know to take the pictures.

47:49.100 --> 47:50.820
And then he stood there for a while

47:50.820 --> 47:52.460
while we waited for the couple who was taking pictures

47:52.460 --> 47:53.380
at the sightseeing point

47:53.380 --> 47:54.980
that we wanted to get our picture taken at.

47:54.980 --> 47:56.820
And eventually after about 30 seconds or so,

47:56.820 --> 47:59.020
the man said, my tour group is gone.

47:59.860 --> 48:04.860
That was a pretty cool time.

48:05.700 --> 48:07.100
It's like, that's what I'm talking about.

48:07.100 --> 48:09.460
That is the kind of social issue I run into

48:09.460 --> 48:11.580
whenever I try to get people to take pictures of us.

48:11.580 --> 48:12.420
Yeah, I think you're good.

48:12.420 --> 48:14.180
I don't think this is the thing you want to force

48:14.180 --> 48:15.620
or try to make happen.

48:15.620 --> 48:17.860
Or else you might as well just like hire a photographer

48:17.860 --> 48:20.100
and say like, hey, would you do like a session with us

48:20.100 --> 48:21.540
and take photographs?

48:21.540 --> 48:22.820
Could you have an open marriage

48:22.820 --> 48:24.620
and the third person is a photographer?

48:24.620 --> 48:25.460
There you go.

48:25.460 --> 48:26.380
There you go.

48:26.380 --> 48:29.060
I really liked our wedding photographers.

48:29.060 --> 48:31.020
Did you really, really like them?

48:31.020 --> 48:32.460
I've seen them at a couple other weddings.

48:32.460 --> 48:33.500
Like open marriage like them?

48:33.500 --> 48:34.780
I've seen them at a couple other weddings

48:34.780 --> 48:35.620
and they remembered us.

48:35.620 --> 48:38.020
So I'm just gonna put that out there.

48:38.020 --> 48:38.940
Okay, just play it cool.

48:38.940 --> 48:39.980
Don't rush it.

48:39.980 --> 48:42.020
Yeah, I hope they're not listeners.

48:42.020 --> 48:43.820
Statistically speaking, they're probably not.

48:43.820 --> 48:46.900
On November 30th, I'm headed down to Cozumel, Mexico

48:46.900 --> 48:48.780
to attempt my first Ironman triathlon.

48:48.780 --> 48:52.540
That's 2.4 miles swimming, 112 miles cycling.

48:52.540 --> 48:54.500
Oh, so this person's full of shit.

48:54.500 --> 48:55.340
And 26.

48:55.340 --> 48:56.180
Nobody's ever done this.

48:56.180 --> 48:57.620
That's something I've never been able to do.

48:57.620 --> 48:59.440
I've been training hard, but I'm still nervous.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.040
It'll be grueling, no shit.

49:01.040 --> 49:03.300
The race will take 12 to 16 hours to complete.

49:03.300 --> 49:04.600
What are you doing?

49:04.600 --> 49:07.100
Do you have any motivational phrases or race tips

49:07.100 --> 49:08.280
I can use to get through the day?

49:08.280 --> 49:09.420
Not so far.

49:09.420 --> 49:10.900
Every edge I could get.

49:10.900 --> 49:13.180
That's Chris from Arlington, Virginia.

49:14.780 --> 49:16.020
Oh, geez.

49:16.020 --> 49:17.060
Carve it.

49:17.060 --> 49:20.180
Carve that racist butt up.

49:20.180 --> 49:23.460
Okay, you have to do one of the three of these.

49:23.460 --> 49:25.100
Doing all three is unthinkable.

49:25.100 --> 49:26.500
You have to do one of the three of these.

49:26.500 --> 49:27.960
Which would you guys pick?

49:29.500 --> 49:32.660
You know, I would say not swimming.

49:32.660 --> 49:33.500
No, fuck no.

49:33.500 --> 49:34.380
Because that seems like a thing

49:34.380 --> 49:36.180
that if you get exhausted in the middle, you die.

49:36.180 --> 49:37.700
You die, you would die in it.

49:37.700 --> 49:39.000
I would definitely die at the running too.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.140
I think the cycling, I would get very sick.

49:42.140 --> 49:44.140
How much of it is downhill?

49:44.140 --> 49:44.980
I don't know, but it's-

49:44.980 --> 49:47.300
112 miles downhill, I think I could do it.

49:47.300 --> 49:50.220
That's the one thing about 112 miles in your cycle,

49:50.220 --> 49:52.660
you can take some breaks for coasties in there.

49:52.660 --> 49:55.900
You can get some coasties to try to like reacclimate.

49:55.900 --> 49:57.560
And you are sitting.

49:57.560 --> 49:58.460
So that's nice.

49:58.460 --> 50:00.180
It's also just occurred to me that I really hope

50:00.180 --> 50:02.660
that this whole triathlon is like a circle

50:02.660 --> 50:05.660
or else when you finish, it's 16 hours later

50:05.660 --> 50:08.100
and you're like a full three hours drive away

50:08.100 --> 50:09.360
from where you started.

50:09.360 --> 50:10.200
And you're like,

50:10.200 --> 50:15.200
oh, how do you get back?

50:15.340 --> 50:18.300
Maybe the best we can provide in terms of motivation

50:18.300 --> 50:20.140
is just telling you that it's impossible.

50:20.140 --> 50:21.700
And so with every step you take,

50:21.700 --> 50:24.100
know that you're defying both us

50:24.100 --> 50:26.940
and the laws of nature and physics.

50:26.940 --> 50:28.420
So this is your friends and my brother and my brother

50:28.420 --> 50:29.740
me telling you it cannot be done.

50:29.740 --> 50:30.620
Can't be done.

50:30.620 --> 50:32.660
No one, you're gonna, no one's crossing that finish line.

50:32.660 --> 50:37.440
No one man has ever finished an Ironman challenge before.

50:38.620 --> 50:39.900
You know what's funny about that?

50:39.900 --> 50:43.140
It would be way harder to do if you were Ironman.

50:43.140 --> 50:45.900
Like really hard, especially the swim.

50:45.900 --> 50:48.400
I don't think you make it 30 seconds in the swimming

50:48.400 --> 50:49.240
if you're Ironman.

50:49.240 --> 50:51.100
You would have to have a super strong bicycle

50:51.100 --> 50:52.460
to hold up the weight of the suit.

50:52.460 --> 50:53.500
And then you're gonna run.

50:53.500 --> 50:55.380
And like, you're not allowed to use your blasters.

50:55.380 --> 50:56.220
Like you have to run.

50:56.220 --> 50:57.180
No thrusters.

50:57.180 --> 50:58.740
I saw that note.

50:58.740 --> 50:59.580
Yeah.

50:59.580 --> 51:01.140
Running, you're gonna leave a bunch of holes in the ground

51:01.140 --> 51:02.220
cause your suits are really heavy.

51:02.220 --> 51:04.720
Shouldn't this be called the Iron Person Triathlon?

51:04.720 --> 51:06.940
It absolutely should be called the Iron Person Triathlon.

51:06.940 --> 51:07.780
Or it should be called

51:07.780 --> 51:09.940
the Iron Imaginary Person Triathlon.

51:09.940 --> 51:12.420
Cause nobody can do that 12 to 16 hours.

51:12.420 --> 51:15.260
I had a 10 hour flight that I sat through.

51:15.260 --> 51:18.140
I took two naps and I watched the Amazing Spider-Man 2.

51:18.140 --> 51:19.340
It sucked dick.

51:19.340 --> 51:21.540
And when I got off the plane, I was exhausted.

51:21.540 --> 51:24.620
It can't be done.

51:24.620 --> 51:26.940
How much money would you guys pay

51:26.940 --> 51:28.540
to participate in a triathlon?

51:28.540 --> 51:30.140
Now hear me out.

51:30.140 --> 51:33.020
All the triathlon is, is it's on an undisclosed location

51:33.020 --> 51:36.020
that only the quote participants are told about.

51:36.020 --> 51:38.840
You get to hang out in like a bunker for 12 hours.

51:38.840 --> 51:40.500
Then they spritz you down with water

51:40.500 --> 51:42.140
and you get to come out like real sweaty

51:42.140 --> 51:43.620
and be like, I did it.

51:43.620 --> 51:45.940
You do a half mile of cycling.

51:45.940 --> 51:48.960
You do 120 feet of the watermelon crawl.

51:48.960 --> 51:52.380
And then they will give you a certificate that says like,

51:52.380 --> 51:54.060
I definitely did this.

51:54.060 --> 51:55.340
And then you get a bus ride back.

51:55.340 --> 51:56.980
That's the third leg.

51:56.980 --> 52:00.820
And everybody gets a participation ribbon

52:00.820 --> 52:04.220
and you get like a photoshopped picture

52:04.220 --> 52:07.620
of you like running through like the ticker tape at the end.

52:07.620 --> 52:08.460
No, you won't.

52:08.460 --> 52:12.140
It's photoshopped because you can't even run like four feet.

52:12.140 --> 52:16.140
It's gonna be your head on the body.

52:16.140 --> 52:17.500
You actually just lay down on a bed

52:17.500 --> 52:19.380
and raise your arms above you and look exhausted.

52:19.380 --> 52:21.660
And then they remove the bed and stand you up.

52:21.660 --> 52:22.820
And stand you up.

52:22.820 --> 52:24.860
They photoshop you next to Usain Bolt.

52:24.860 --> 52:26.100
He's got his arm around you.

52:26.100 --> 52:28.100
This guy can run.

52:28.100 --> 52:30.540
There's a speech bubble in the photoshop.

52:30.540 --> 52:34.380
This guy's a running fiend.

52:34.380 --> 52:37.500
Everything I know about running, I learned from Steve.

52:37.500 --> 52:38.900
The one condition I would need

52:38.900 --> 52:41.660
if I was gonna do an Iron Man triathlon

52:41.660 --> 52:43.980
or an Iron Person triathlon, if you like,

52:43.980 --> 52:46.220
is that at the end,

52:46.220 --> 52:49.520
I would need there to be complimentary pizza and pop.

52:49.520 --> 52:52.260
If I got like halfway through

52:52.260 --> 52:54.100
and I knew that waiting for it at the end

52:54.100 --> 52:57.860
was complimentary pizza and my choice of soft drink,

52:57.860 --> 52:59.940
I think I would be able to push through to the end.

52:59.940 --> 53:01.740
I'm gonna sweeten the deal and motivate.

53:01.740 --> 53:04.300
Here's the motivation for our listener.

53:04.300 --> 53:05.580
At the end of the race,

53:05.580 --> 53:07.300
there's complimentary pizza and pop,

53:07.300 --> 53:09.300
but there's not enough for everybody.

53:09.300 --> 53:11.680
And I heard they were running out.

53:11.680 --> 53:15.500
And you're racing against a bunch of hunky boys.

53:15.500 --> 53:18.420
Here is my no bullshit offer to you,

53:18.420 --> 53:20.180
Chris from Orleans in Virginia.

53:20.180 --> 53:22.600
If you complete the Iron Man triathlon

53:22.600 --> 53:25.740
and you send us a picture of you completing it

53:25.740 --> 53:27.440
along with your mailing address.

53:27.440 --> 53:30.140
No Usain Bolt Photoshop shitty bullshit.

53:30.140 --> 53:31.040
No bullshit.

53:31.040 --> 53:32.820
If you finish this race,

53:32.820 --> 53:35.100
I will send you a complimentary,

53:35.100 --> 53:37.740
through delivery, complimentary pizza

53:37.740 --> 53:40.480
and two liter of your choice of soft drink.

53:40.480 --> 53:42.800
I am guaranteeing you free pizza and pop

53:42.800 --> 53:45.500
from my own wallet delivered to your door

53:45.500 --> 53:46.780
if you complete the triathlon,

53:46.780 --> 53:49.200
but believe me, you'll have earned it.

53:49.200 --> 53:50.280
Free pizza and pop.

53:50.280 --> 53:51.260
There's the motivation.

53:51.260 --> 53:52.080
Go get it.

53:52.080 --> 53:53.880
And let's push it even further.

53:53.880 --> 53:57.660
We will extend this offer to the first person

53:57.660 --> 53:59.420
who sends us this thing.

53:59.420 --> 54:01.820
And it has to be, I need you to have a sign,

54:01.820 --> 54:02.660
like holding a sign.

54:02.660 --> 54:04.760
It's like M-B-M-B-A-M and date it.

54:04.760 --> 54:07.380
Cause I don't want some old Iron Man triathlon photo.

54:07.380 --> 54:08.340
I want a new one.

54:08.340 --> 54:11.420
The first person to complete an Iron Man triathlon

54:11.420 --> 54:15.660
and send a picture with something denoting it as for us,

54:15.660 --> 54:17.180
I will send you complimentary pizza.

54:17.180 --> 54:19.980
And don't do your own Iron Man triathlon.

54:19.980 --> 54:21.400
It has to be an official event.

54:21.400 --> 54:23.060
Don't just like, while you're listening to this episode,

54:23.060 --> 54:25.540
be like, I gotta go and start swimming.

54:25.540 --> 54:28.920
Don't just start swimming.

54:28.920 --> 54:31.020
You need to be in water.

54:31.020 --> 54:32.580
At the end, you will be lost.

54:32.580 --> 54:33.980
I can guarantee you that.

54:33.980 --> 54:35.180
All right, so that's gonna do it for us here

54:35.180 --> 54:36.100
on my brother and my brother and me.

54:36.100 --> 54:38.980
We hope you had a good time.

54:38.980 --> 54:41.460
Got some fun news for you.

54:41.460 --> 54:43.020
If you didn't hear in the last episode

54:43.020 --> 54:45.240
or on our various social media channels,

54:45.240 --> 54:49.680
we are doing a live show in Huntington, West Virginia,

54:49.680 --> 54:54.660
our hometown, Huntington City Hall, December 21st

54:54.660 --> 54:58.140
at 7 p.m. with Sawbones,

54:58.140 --> 55:01.140
the medical history podcast I do with my wife, Sydney.

55:01.140 --> 55:05.400
We are gonna do a live recording

55:05.400 --> 55:07.020
called My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

55:07.020 --> 55:10.020
Home for the Candle Nights, A Holiday Spectacular.

55:10.020 --> 55:12.380
You can get tickets to that.

55:12.380 --> 55:14.780
Yeah, they're super cheap, 15 buck ticket,

55:14.780 --> 55:19.780
and you can get them at mbmbamcandlenights.brownpapertickets.com.

55:20.420 --> 55:21.460
We've had some people ask,

55:21.460 --> 55:24.740
how far is reasonable to travel in from?

55:24.740 --> 55:27.460
And I'm not here to answer that for you.

55:27.460 --> 55:29.100
You gotta look in your own heart.

55:29.980 --> 55:31.980
But I know that there are people flying in for it.

55:31.980 --> 55:32.820
There are people driving in and out of Chicago.

55:32.820 --> 55:36.040
I know, we have sold tickets from as far away as Chicago.

55:37.780 --> 55:41.660
Lindsey and Davin that work at Max Fun Friends,

55:41.660 --> 55:42.900
they have bought tickets,

55:42.900 --> 55:44.900
and they live here in California with me.

55:45.900 --> 55:46.740
Oh, shit.

55:46.740 --> 55:49.900
Yeah, and so I will say it's gonna be a great show.

55:49.900 --> 55:50.940
It's gonna be super fun.

55:50.940 --> 55:52.580
We're really excited to do it.

55:52.580 --> 55:55.260
So I think anybody who comes is gonna have a great time.

55:55.260 --> 55:58.300
We're gonna find some things to do in Huntington

55:58.300 --> 56:01.280
either before or after, or maybe both.

56:01.280 --> 56:02.900
There's a lot of places that are closer

56:02.900 --> 56:04.020
than you would think.

56:05.800 --> 56:07.860
Lexington is two hours away.

56:07.860 --> 56:10.180
If you're in Morgantown, it's about three hours.

56:10.180 --> 56:11.020
Pittsburgh is about four.

56:11.020 --> 56:12.620
I think people in Morgantown, West Virginia

56:12.620 --> 56:14.460
know how far away they are from Huntington.

56:14.460 --> 56:15.380
Fair enough.

56:15.380 --> 56:17.060
Louisville's three hours.

56:17.060 --> 56:18.460
Nashville's like five, I think.

56:18.460 --> 56:20.060
We have some people coming in from Nashville.

56:20.060 --> 56:22.140
Tickets are selling faster than we expected.

56:22.140 --> 56:22.980
We're not sold out yet,

56:22.980 --> 56:24.180
so that you still have a chance to get them,

56:24.180 --> 56:25.660
but do not wait.

56:25.660 --> 56:26.500
Make sure you get them,

56:26.500 --> 56:29.140
especially if you're planning to travel in

56:29.140 --> 56:30.580
and you're making those travel plans now.

56:30.580 --> 56:33.600
Go ahead and get your tickets before they sell out.

56:33.600 --> 56:34.440
And send any questions.

56:34.440 --> 56:36.040
If you need some travel recommendations,

56:36.040 --> 56:39.300
I put some up on my blog, Justin McElroy,

56:39.300 --> 56:41.540
what is it, JustinMcElroy.wordpress.net,

56:41.540 --> 56:42.860
I think, or wordpress.com,

56:42.860 --> 56:45.460
where I recommended some things to do

56:45.460 --> 56:46.580
in Huntington while you're here.

56:46.580 --> 56:49.620
There's also an event page on Facebook

56:49.620 --> 56:50.820
where I've posted that link,

56:50.820 --> 56:53.460
and you should go say that you're gonna come to the show,

56:53.460 --> 56:55.540
and you can see that and make plans,

56:55.540 --> 56:56.360
meet up with people.

56:56.360 --> 56:57.200
There's a lot to do here.

56:57.200 --> 56:58.420
There's a lot of fun stuff going on,

56:58.420 --> 57:00.140
so I think it's gonna be a fun weekend.

57:00.140 --> 57:04.320
We're probably gonna plan some other stuff around that event.

57:05.620 --> 57:08.460
If you wanna send anything to the West Coast HQ,

57:08.460 --> 57:12.340
it's P.O. Box 34-1769,

57:12.340 --> 57:16.020

If you wanna send something to me,

57:18.400 --> 57:21.820
it's P.O. Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia 2706.

57:21.820 --> 57:24.360
We got one from Jason,

57:24.360 --> 57:26.820
and he sent us his band's album.

57:26.820 --> 57:29.280
The name of the album is Endless Dicks.

57:29.280 --> 57:32.120
I got a repurposed birthday card from Mary.

57:32.120 --> 57:32.960
There we go.

57:32.960 --> 57:36.940
And we got, I got some games from,

57:36.940 --> 57:38.720
I'm gonna look that up while Justin talks

57:38.720 --> 57:41.980
about something else.

57:41.980 --> 57:45.580
Okay, I will talk to us about our Facebook group.

57:45.580 --> 57:49.420
It's at, just search for My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

57:49.420 --> 57:50.500
It's there, you'll find it.

57:50.500 --> 57:53.000
It's not hard, but it's a booming community

57:53.000 --> 57:53.960
full of people that love you.

57:53.960 --> 57:56.300
Also, wanna say a big thanks to Nature Box.

57:56.300 --> 57:58.060

58:04.200 --> 58:05.780
I wanna thank John Roderick in the long winters

58:05.780 --> 58:07.500
for the use of our theme song Into Departure

58:07.500 --> 58:09.980
off of the album Putting the Days to Bed.

58:09.980 --> 58:13.000
It's really, it's fantastic tunes, man.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.620
We got, this is what I got.

58:14.620 --> 58:17.500
I got a Shakespeare role-playing game

58:17.500 --> 58:20.060
and a slash fiction role-playing game

58:20.060 --> 58:21.820
from Games by Playdate.

58:21.820 --> 58:23.960
So at Games by Playdate sent us those,

58:23.960 --> 58:26.460
and they look really cool, and I can't wait to play them.

58:26.460 --> 58:29.140
They also made the Sawbones game, they sent you one of those.

58:29.140 --> 58:30.500
Ooh, really?

58:30.500 --> 58:32.580
Yeah, the Sawbones card game, it's fun.

58:32.580 --> 58:35.500
Trav, we got a YouTube channel.

58:35.500 --> 58:38.700
It's YouTube.com slash NBNBAM.

58:38.700 --> 58:42.160
We have a new cartoon up there about scarecrows

58:42.160 --> 58:44.980
that you should go watch, and Trav's making bits

58:44.980 --> 58:46.460
for you to go, if you could subscribe to that,

58:46.460 --> 58:49.340
and then just like send the link around to your friends.

58:50.220 --> 58:52.780
And if you are Adult Swim and you wanna make our cartoon

58:52.780 --> 58:54.820
into a TV show, just go ahead and do that,

58:54.820 --> 58:56.180
and just send us a check or whatever.

58:56.180 --> 58:59.180
Also, I wanna say I'm sorry that housekeeping

58:59.180 --> 59:01.600
is so long these days, but we just got a lot of irons

59:01.600 --> 59:03.100
in the fire, because we love you,

59:03.100 --> 59:05.940
and we wanna keep doing stuff for you and with you

59:05.940 --> 59:09.140
and just having a great time, so sorry about that.

59:09.140 --> 59:11.020
If you wanna skip it, it won't hurt my feelings,

59:11.020 --> 59:12.740
but you shouldn't, because you never know

59:12.740 --> 59:16.060
what you might miss, like new merch at maxfunstore.com.

59:16.060 --> 59:18.080
That's just more housekeeping.

59:18.080 --> 59:19.440
That's just more out of the same.

59:19.440 --> 59:21.220
You might miss more housekeeping.

59:21.220 --> 59:23.740
What's our featured Max Fun Show of the Week?

59:23.740 --> 59:26.460
I wanna feature Song Exploder, it's so, so, so good.

59:26.460 --> 59:31.460
It's Rishke Sherway, who busts out the different parts

59:31.820 --> 59:34.060
of songs with the bands who did them,

59:34.060 --> 59:38.060
did an episode with Onomataguchi on the song Prom Night,

59:38.060 --> 59:40.940
which is fucking fantastic, and Onomataguchi talked about

59:40.940 --> 59:44.020
this group called Capsule that Rachel and I got really into

59:44.020 --> 59:45.940
while we were in Japan.

59:45.940 --> 59:50.500
Kinda wanna make it, I love the long winter theme song

59:50.500 --> 59:54.200
we have now, but these J-pop tunes are so fucking fresh.

59:54.200 --> 59:55.140
So check that out.

59:55.140 --> 59:57.900
I may do my own podcast that has Capsule as a theme song,

59:57.900 --> 59:59.820
and I talk about Vore all day.

59:59.820 --> 01:00:01.760
And I think that there's a very specific audience

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.260
that would get very into that.

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.660
So anyway, yeah, go listen to Song Exploder, it's great.

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.500
They talk about music parts in Vore.

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:11.960
Excellent, that's good deal for us.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.220
I think we're probably fucking done.

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.380
Yep, this following IHU was sent in by Drew Davenport.

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:17.800
Thank you, Drew, it's by Yahoo Answers user J Rock,

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.300
who asks, how can people laugh when they see someone

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.540
with a wallet chain, but they cry when they lose

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:24.540
their wallet?

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:25.380
Yeah.

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:27.500

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:39.340

Hi, I'm Julie Sabatier, host of Destination DIY.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.380
It's a show about people taking matters

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:06.040
into their own hands, and we're really excited

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.260
to be bringing it to Maximum Fun.

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:11.220
You know, having that experience of I can do that

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.300
makes me feel like I can almost do anything.

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:16.140
Here at Destination DIY, we like to push

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.560
the do-it-yourself envelope beyond crafts

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.020
and home improvement.

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:22.840
So tune in to hear the stories of makers, builders,

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.500
inventors, and all kinds of creative people.

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.420
You can essentially build a do-it-yourself space program

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:31.220
today, and now luckily I'm a part of that.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:34.820
Check out Destination DIY at Maximumfun.org,

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:54.820
or wherever you like to listen to podcasts.
