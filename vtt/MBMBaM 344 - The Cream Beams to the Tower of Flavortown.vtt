00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.760
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and the Advice Show for the

00:47.760 --> 00:52.400
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.400 --> 00:56.400
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.880
You said you had something funny to say, Griffin.

00:58.880 --> 01:05.600
It's just, I, the ox, the ox, the oxers were last night, and we all had, I think we can all agree,

01:05.600 --> 01:11.600
a really fun time watching them. Got a little silly there at the end.

01:12.720 --> 01:17.120
Now, Griffin, was that, was that silly like in the way of when they like drop candy and donuts from

01:17.120 --> 01:23.040
the sky silly, or? That was very silly, but they did something even sillier at the end that I

01:23.040 --> 01:26.480
thought was- Oh, do you mean like when they brought in the tour group, and they were like,

01:26.480 --> 01:30.400
you're going to look at dresses, but it was actually like- That was super silly,

01:30.400 --> 01:34.240
and it was just sort of Jimmy's sort of patented sort of prank.

01:34.240 --> 01:38.960
Do you mean when they fucking robbed our dear friend, Lin-Manuel Miranda,

01:38.960 --> 01:43.760
of his deserved Oscar that he deserved for writing the best song of the year?

01:43.760 --> 01:45.360
Is that what you mean, Griffin? That they robbed him?

01:45.360 --> 01:49.440
On that note, this is uncalled for. And us, by extension, by the way.

01:49.440 --> 01:53.680
Because he would have called that great job horn so many times from that podium.

01:53.680 --> 01:57.440
It's the closest I would have ever gotten to winning an Oscar, and they took that from me.

01:59.120 --> 02:05.440
Yes, that is, that was uncomfortable. And I know we were all there for our friend,

02:05.440 --> 02:09.520
Lin, when he was robbed during that scene. Although this part's actually not silly.

02:09.520 --> 02:18.240
This is actually kind of uncomfortable in that I'm afraid that our friendship with Lin is over

02:18.240 --> 02:22.400
now, and now La La Land is my best friend. Is that right? Does that make sense?

02:22.400 --> 02:24.560
That's uncomfortable. That seems unpleasant.

02:26.560 --> 02:30.880
We have a TV show now, so we have to keep swinging to the next sexiest Vine.

02:30.880 --> 02:34.800
And he's been a sexy Vine for such a long time, and a really good dude,

02:34.800 --> 02:38.240
like a super, super good dude. But friendship with Lin is over now.

02:38.240 --> 02:43.200
La La Land is now my best friend. Gonna find out the name of the person who did it?

02:43.200 --> 02:48.880
Because I watched this, I didn't see the movie, but I've seen pictures of it.

02:48.880 --> 02:52.000
And I know it's Ryan Gosling, and he's in there playing piano.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.160
But did he play the, did he actually make the songs?

02:56.000 --> 02:56.720
It's unclear.

02:56.720 --> 02:57.760
It's a confusing movie.

03:00.160 --> 03:07.840
I haven't seen La La Land yet, but the scene that they used to be like Ryan Gosling for Best Actor

03:07.840 --> 03:14.560
is a scene of a person at a jazz club while jazz people are trying to play jazz.

03:15.120 --> 03:20.160
And here's this person in the audience at full voice talking about what's going on.

03:20.160 --> 03:24.400
And all I can think is that person needs to be removed from this place.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.040
That's not real jazz, man.

03:27.040 --> 03:32.960
But at some point, a host or a server should have come over and said,

03:32.960 --> 03:35.200
excuse me, sir, could you shut the fuck up?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.520
Yeah, I mean, that's the secret.

03:39.200 --> 03:45.680
A member of the Marsalis family or Cannonball, they don't talk during jazz.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.520
That's like the rule one of jazz. Rule two is just make a bunch of stuff up.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.480
But like Cannonball will tell you, do not talk during the jazz.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.360
That's the second rule.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.440
No eye contact during jazz.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.560
No, God, no.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.200
Yeah. And then the third rule is just make a bunch of shit up.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.880
And yeah, good luck.

04:02.480 --> 04:10.480
No, the silly part is talking about where Faye and Warren who are two national sort of treasures,

04:11.840 --> 04:14.880
masters of the stage and screen, masters of their craft.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.720
Like they're both masters of their craft, you know,

04:16.720 --> 04:19.840
and they've they've they've accomplished some great works between the two of them.

04:19.840 --> 04:24.320
But they did remind us that they are still older folks.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.240
It's not their fault.

04:26.240 --> 04:34.080
Well, if I'm sorry, if you know you're dishing out best pick at the end,

04:34.080 --> 04:38.720
the big show and you get handed a card that has Emma Stone's name on it,

04:38.720 --> 04:44.240
I think you would go there's been a mistake before you just pull the fucking trigger

04:44.240 --> 04:48.720
and just say another this card says Emma Stone won best picture.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.520
Get up here, Emma.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.320
You did it.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.840
Can we get a good movie?

04:51.840 --> 04:52.800
I want to dissect.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.480
I want to dissect that moment for a second,

04:54.480 --> 04:57.600
because I think Warren Beatty got a lot of heat for that moment.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.680
I think he's going to continue to get a lot of shade thrown out.

04:59.680 --> 05:02.000
Well, first of all, I think that's undeserved

05:02.000 --> 05:04.880
because I think Faye is the one that took that ball and ran with it.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.840
That's what I'm saying, because Warren Beatty opens the envelope was like,

05:07.840 --> 05:09.520
wait, Emma Stone's not a movie.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.000
Warren Beatty knows Emma Stone is not a movie.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.960
And Faye Dunaway goes, oh, you're terrible.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.240
And all I can think is inside Warren Beatty's head,

05:18.240 --> 05:21.280
he must have just been screaming, Faye, no.

05:21.280 --> 05:28.880
Faye at that point made a fucking risk reward sort of evaluation

05:28.880 --> 05:33.120
and decided I don't want to be up on this stage anymore in this uncomfy moment.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.600
So I'm just going to pull the trigger on this fucking thing

05:35.600 --> 05:40.480
without even like blocking down whether or not I'm saying the name of the real best pick.

05:40.480 --> 05:43.040
It's weird that Emma Stone's name is so big on this card,

05:43.040 --> 05:45.600
but whatever, I'll read the movie name smaller.

05:45.600 --> 05:50.720
I just feel like what we're seeing is old Hollywood

05:51.440 --> 05:55.360
still having its instincts in place for heat seeking.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.720
My man Warren and my lady Faye are nothing if not heat seekers.

05:58.720 --> 06:02.960
They saw that and they thought my man Warren looked at that card

06:02.960 --> 06:04.480
and you know what crosses mind?

06:05.120 --> 06:06.400
Time to go trending.

06:06.400 --> 06:10.080
Time to get back in the fucking limelight.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.840
Have I had sex with Emma Stone?

06:11.840 --> 06:12.800
I'm Warren Beatty.

06:13.360 --> 06:17.200
I'm Warren Beatty, but also now time to trend.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.560
Time to get on this comet and trend with me, Faye.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.840
Hey Faye, take my hand.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.400
Take my hand and follow me.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.600
It's time to trend.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.240
I have no idea what that means, but I want to do it.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.680
I do want to do it.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.560
I hear a lot of people trending and it's time to trend, Faye.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.200
Come with me.

06:34.320 --> 06:38.160
Catch this comet in a net with me, Faye, and fly to trending.

06:38.160 --> 06:45.840
Is it possible that this really silly thing that happened here at the end-

06:45.840 --> 06:46.960
It's a zag.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.640
I mean, let's call it a good fucking zag.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.320
It's a fucking zag at half.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.440
It's a silly switch up.

06:51.440 --> 06:57.040
Do you think that this was done somehow as sort of a magic trick prank

06:57.040 --> 07:04.720
by Now You See Me Too as a sort of like slight for being slighted by the Oscar noms?

07:06.560 --> 07:07.600
Anything's possible.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.280
I really wish La La Land could have won it because that's my best friend now

07:11.280 --> 07:14.880
and I would have loved it to have that feather in its cap.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.440
But super congratulations to Moonlight.

07:17.440 --> 07:23.040
I should say I would love, love, love to talk about all the movies

07:23.040 --> 07:25.280
and if they deserved it and who won what.

07:25.280 --> 07:31.840
I saw, let me see, 0.01% of the movies nominated

07:31.840 --> 07:34.800
and that's just like the 10 minutes I was awake

07:34.800 --> 07:38.400
during Dr. Strange.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.160
Not because Dr. Strange was a boring movie.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.840
I had just had a baby.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.680
So I was just very asleep.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.040
Took it to sleep, sleepberg.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.600
I'm thinking about being a parent of a young child

07:47.600 --> 07:50.320
when you're watching the Oscars for me this year.

07:51.200 --> 07:56.960
Most of the awards I was about engaged with and as like versed in

07:57.520 --> 08:00.480
as if I was watching awards for lawn furniture design.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.400
Like it might as well have been that until the animated segment

08:04.400 --> 08:08.080
at which point I was like on my feet losing it.

08:08.080 --> 08:12.800
Like just like listing off the merits and demerits

08:12.800 --> 08:14.320
of all the nominated pictures.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.920
How do you, let's get into this.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.360
How do you feel about Zootopia?

08:17.360 --> 08:18.080
Taking the big one.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.400
Zootopia has a great message.

08:20.400 --> 08:20.800
Yes.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.000
And it's that animals deserve to be people.

08:24.560 --> 08:25.120
Something like that.

08:25.120 --> 08:28.640
Well, it's not really that so much.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.160
Zootopia is a fine film with a great message.

08:32.160 --> 08:36.880
Does it make me cry every time I watch it when she's like,

08:36.880 --> 08:39.360
I am Moana and I'm like, me too.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.240
And I'm on my feet crying and screaming at the screen?

08:42.240 --> 08:42.640
Yeah.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.240
No, absolutely not.

08:44.240 --> 08:46.880
But it's a movie about discrimination,

08:46.880 --> 08:50.240
which seems like a good message for right now.

08:50.240 --> 08:50.640
Yeah.

08:50.640 --> 08:54.800
How to do it in a good way that's very secret and no one will know about.

08:56.000 --> 08:56.560
Wait, hold on.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.560
I haven't seen Zootopia, Justin.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.360
Is Zootopia about how to get away with racism?

09:01.360 --> 09:03.120
No, it's about.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.000
Okay.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.240
No, but I'll tell you what it's not about, inspiring a generation.

09:08.240 --> 09:12.080
Well, it probably is also about, it is kind of like also that.

09:12.080 --> 09:12.640
I get you.

09:12.640 --> 09:15.840
I mean, I get you, but yeah.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.080
They're both fine pictures.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.720
Moana is obviously better, but it's fine.

09:22.720 --> 09:26.160
I tried to watch Kubo, but it was a little bit dark

09:26.160 --> 09:28.560
and my daughter lost interest in 10 minutes.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.800
So I'll give that one a Razzie.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.000
That one gets a Razzie from me.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.280
Just because it was just again,

09:33.280 --> 09:35.440
just because the colors were a little muted.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.560
Well, colors were dark and there wasn't a big musical number

09:38.560 --> 09:39.760
within the first 10 minutes.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.880
Can I say just before we move on for the Oscars,

09:42.880 --> 09:48.320
I would like to give my own award and this is 100% all sincerity.

09:48.320 --> 09:52.400
Best jacket at the Oscars goes to Dwayne The Rock Johnson.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.360
Oh, was it?

09:53.360 --> 09:54.320
That jacket.

09:54.320 --> 09:57.280
Oh, it was an amazing like blue velvet number.

09:57.280 --> 10:01.760
Oh, I fell in love with it right away.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.560
And now we gotta do our worst dress segment.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.120
Can you even believe they left the house in it?

10:07.120 --> 10:08.640
And I'll start things out.

10:08.640 --> 10:13.440
Josh Gad was just, he was wearing, he's wearing just a suit,

10:13.440 --> 10:16.240
but his wiener was hanging out the whole time.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.320
But really the problem was the shoulder pads.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.760
The shoulder pads were a bit wild, yes.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.040
The wiener was fine.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.160
The wiener was excellent.

10:26.160 --> 10:31.360
I liked when Deadpool jumped up, ran up on the stage

10:31.360 --> 10:33.840
and he was like, I'm gonna let you finish.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.320
But actually Deadpool was the best.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.800
That was like very good viral and his butt was out

10:38.800 --> 10:40.720
and he was like, fart you very much.

10:40.720 --> 10:44.320
He said fart you very much and it was like kind of inappropriate

10:44.320 --> 10:46.800
because it was like La La Land won and then they got up

10:46.800 --> 10:48.480
and they're like, no, we didn't, Moonlight won

10:48.480 --> 10:50.080
and then Moonlight got up to accept his award

10:50.080 --> 10:53.040
and then he ran up and he was like, Deadpool won, I'm sorry.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.040
I didn't know that the other thing was gonna happen

10:55.040 --> 10:58.160
and now this is all getting a little over complicated.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.200
Can we go back?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.720
Can we edit this?

11:01.600 --> 11:02.480
No, Mr. Reynolds.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.560
Anyway, if anybody has La La Land's phone number

11:06.560 --> 11:08.960
and or wants to like tell them about our show

11:08.960 --> 11:11.120
so I can get that certifier going.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.600
Can we not joke about this, please?

11:13.600 --> 11:15.440
Because Lin will take it very personally.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.440
It's not personally, but seriously,

11:17.440 --> 11:20.160
and he'll take the joke too far and he'll stop talking to us

11:20.160 --> 11:22.000
and he'll make us talk to La La Land

11:22.000 --> 11:23.280
and that's a movie, not a person.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.400
I don't stand with Griffin on this, Lin.

11:26.400 --> 11:29.120
Anyway, that's our skewed take on the Oscars.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.640
It's our skewed views.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.560
Why don't we do more movie stuff?

11:32.560 --> 11:33.760
We've got a lot to say.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.120
Suicide Squad won a, what, it did?

11:37.120 --> 11:40.000
So that's like could be one whole segment

11:40.000 --> 11:42.320
and it's like Hacksaw Ridge, really?

11:42.320 --> 11:44.240
That could be a whole different segment.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.240
Neither one of those movies have I seen.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.040
No, God, no.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.880
They don't give it to the movies that I like,

11:50.880 --> 11:54.400
which is like the movies that I saw in the theater.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.760
Because I'm looking down the list,

11:56.320 --> 11:58.800
I saw, I did see Deadpool in the theater.

11:59.520 --> 12:00.240
That got a nom?

12:01.200 --> 12:05.120
No noms for Deadpool on this one.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.640
Maybe we'll nominate it next year.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.760
You know how they always do like Stuff We Missed?

12:09.760 --> 12:10.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.760
Or like Missed Connections?

12:12.880 --> 12:15.360
I should see movies that don't have superheroes in them,

12:15.360 --> 12:17.280
I think, if I want to get the most out of the Oscars.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.760
The Doctor Strange got a nom.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.640
It got the nom for the best effect things.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.800
Hey, also while we're talking about best effects Oscars,

12:27.920 --> 12:29.760
if I could bend your ear for a second,

12:30.640 --> 12:34.240
I think I'm with you in that it's very funny

12:34.240 --> 12:36.800
that no one understands the technical awards.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.720
Like that's hysterical, I'm with you.

12:39.280 --> 12:45.040
Maybe that doesn't have to be the joke every single year

12:45.040 --> 12:47.120
and multiple times per show.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.840
Like at some point don't you just expect

12:49.840 --> 12:52.000
those special effects wizards to stand up and say,

12:52.000 --> 12:53.040
we get it!

12:53.040 --> 12:54.880
Or alternatively they say,

12:54.880 --> 12:56.240
fuck you, we're taking a year off.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.160
And then Jurassic World 2 comes out

12:58.160 --> 13:01.280
and all the dinosaurs are just like fucking dudes

13:01.280 --> 13:03.920
in those stupid inflatable costumes and that's it.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.480
And then the next year it's like, okay guys, we're sorry.

13:06.480 --> 13:07.840
This year the technical Oscars

13:07.840 --> 13:09.200
are the only Oscars we're gonna do.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.520
The best actress was handed out

13:11.520 --> 13:13.680
in a non-televised segment of the show.

13:13.680 --> 13:18.480
But anyway, here's a new way of fucking a new stylus

13:18.480 --> 13:19.760
that you can use to draw shit.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.120
But it's amazing.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.720
I think it's horrible that the people

13:22.720 --> 13:25.440
who actually make the movies get cloistered off

13:25.440 --> 13:29.760
to their sub Oscars, but best animated short?

13:29.760 --> 13:30.320
Like really?

13:30.320 --> 13:30.720
Those animated shorts were amazing though.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.960
Unless it's before Pixar movie, nobody saw it.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.480
They were amazing though.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.160
Here's my problem with it.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.120
We really are doing this fucking thing.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.560
Year over year they're like,

13:40.560 --> 13:42.320
technical we don't even know what's going on.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.000
And guaranteed there's people that work

13:44.000 --> 13:45.040
in the technical field like,

13:45.040 --> 13:47.200
oh, okay, well we'd be happy to explain it to you.

13:47.200 --> 13:50.640
Nope, no, you'd ruin the joke.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.920
It's like, we just don't get it.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.760
Did you see fucking Finding Dory?

13:55.760 --> 13:57.120
We made all of it.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.080
All of it was me.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.520
It was me, my name's Clark

13:59.520 --> 14:01.920
and I made Finding Dory with my computer.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.480
If they had spent half the time,

14:04.480 --> 14:06.400
they spent joking about not understanding them

14:06.400 --> 14:07.680
to actually explaining them,

14:07.680 --> 14:12.640
we would all have like minors in special effect

14:13.280 --> 14:15.120
design work engineering.

14:15.120 --> 14:15.920
That would be amazing.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.760
Next year, Andrew Garfield gets up

14:17.760 --> 14:19.200
to present the technical Oscars

14:19.200 --> 14:20.160
and he gets up and he goes,

14:20.160 --> 14:22.160
I'm supposed to talk about how I don't understand that.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.000
That's the shit they've written for me here.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.160
And he just throws away the script

14:26.160 --> 14:27.840
and he like sits down at a table

14:27.840 --> 14:29.920
and has a three hour long conversation

14:29.920 --> 14:32.160
about the new like refraction lenses.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.000
He pulls a fucking Justin Trudeau up there.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.160
He's like, well, I'll break this shit down.

14:38.160 --> 14:38.960
How long you got?

14:39.920 --> 14:41.120
The history of the camera.

14:43.120 --> 14:46.240
Here's the best part is it's all wrong and lies

14:46.240 --> 14:47.840
but it is three hours long.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.640
Here's how I bet it works.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.320
And now I've never used a camera

14:54.320 --> 14:55.440
but if I had to guess,

14:56.800 --> 14:59.520
okay, time to get into the advice.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.720
Here's my first question.

15:00.720 --> 15:03.280
Yesterday, I went to a used video store

15:03.280 --> 15:04.160
and I tried to buy a copy

15:04.160 --> 15:05.920
of the Denzel Washington movie, Unstoppable.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.080
Denzel was robbed again.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.680
It's the greatest act of our time.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.280
I took the case to the register

15:11.280 --> 15:14.080
but the girl couldn't find the disc in the filing cabinet.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.680
She took my name and phone number

15:15.680 --> 15:17.680
and said she'd call when and if they found it.

15:17.680 --> 15:18.320
Here's the problem.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.440
I don't actually want Unstoppable that badly.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.360
If I never go back to pick it up, am I good?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.440
And that's from somewhat of Unstoppable,

15:31.440 --> 15:32.400
somewhat Stoppable.

15:32.400 --> 15:35.280
Yeah, I mean, a lot of issues.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.920
This is the wild train movie, right?

15:37.920 --> 15:39.680
Where Denzel has to fight a big train

15:39.680 --> 15:42.000
with the help of Captain Kirk.

15:42.000 --> 15:42.800
I think so.

15:42.800 --> 15:48.800
A lot of Hollywood glitz in this episode, I think.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.160
Yeah, a lot of that razzle-dazzle.

15:50.160 --> 15:51.840
No stars in the sky tonight.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.520
They are all in this episode.

15:53.520 --> 15:57.280
I think I used to work at a GameStop

15:57.280 --> 16:02.080
and if you came in and you tried to buy SSX trains,

16:02.080 --> 16:04.240
SSX Tricky, and I was like, I can't find the disc.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.160
I'll take your name down and if I find the disc,

16:06.160 --> 16:06.800
I'll let you know.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.400
That's just sort of a salve for you

16:10.400 --> 16:12.080
to try to get you to leave the store

16:12.080 --> 16:13.760
because I ain't gonna find that disc.

16:13.760 --> 16:19.440
If it's not right in the SSX section of my folio,

16:19.440 --> 16:22.080
then I'm not going to locate the disc.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.200
In three months, when fucking Halo 8 comes out

16:25.200 --> 16:27.200
and I am stocking up Halo 8,

16:27.200 --> 16:30.000
a fucking SSX Tricky disc is not going to fall

16:30.000 --> 16:32.160
from a hidden crevice in the cabinet.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.160
That disc is gone and the game is gone forever.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.600
Unstoppable is gone.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.280
It got dragged to hell and I'm very sorry.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.760
Somebody threw it in the fucking garbage can or stole it.

16:39.760 --> 16:40.880
That is how it does.

16:40.880 --> 16:44.000
Griffin, let me paint a counter picture for you.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.600
One in which miracles can happen and angels do exist.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.160
Let me take down your number.

16:50.160 --> 16:54.000
I'll call you as soon as we find a copy of it.

16:54.000 --> 16:54.960
They find it.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.880
They call them like, oh, okay, yeah, great.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.760
And then the next day, somebody else comes in and say,

16:59.760 --> 17:01.360
hey, is that Unstoppable?

17:01.360 --> 17:03.440
No, this is for Dave.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.600
This is Dave's copy.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.120
And then Dave doesn't come in.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.400
And then the next day, somebody else is like,

17:08.400 --> 17:09.520
ooh, Unstoppable.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.960
I've been meaning to check that out.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.200
Can I please buy that VHS copy?

17:13.200 --> 17:15.440
No, this is Dave's copy.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.080
But after a while, the store clerk begins

17:18.080 --> 17:19.440
to lose faith in Dave.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.960
And then by extension, humanity, sadness reigns.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.560
Is that it?

17:24.560 --> 17:25.600
The fin.

17:25.600 --> 17:28.080
Oh, Jesus, Travis, I thought there was going to be a turn.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.080
No, that's the thing, Griffin, there is no turn

17:30.080 --> 17:32.000
because Dave did not go get Unstoppable.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.160
I have a fun story along these lines.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.120
A friend in college.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.440
Used to work at Blockbuster and stole a copy of Showgirls.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.720
Yeah, tell me all about this friend.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.320
I didn't steal a copy of Showgirls.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.280
I stole a copy of Fight Club.

17:45.280 --> 17:46.640
It's in our fucking TV show.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.480
Cisto.com, free week.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.640
I forgot, you're only allowed to steal one thing

17:50.640 --> 17:51.760
when you work at Blockbuster.

17:51.760 --> 17:56.000
No, I had Tommy Redd come over and videotape Showgirls off HBO

17:56.000 --> 17:57.120
while we were on vacation.

17:57.120 --> 18:00.880
Anyway, a friend of mine was working in a video store in LA

18:01.760 --> 18:08.240
and Lance Henderson came in and he asked for a Millennium

18:08.800 --> 18:11.840
and the guy working the desk said,

18:11.840 --> 18:16.720
do you want the 1989 movie or do you want the TV show?

18:16.720 --> 18:19.760
And Lance Henderson said, I want the one with me in it.

18:20.880 --> 18:24.000
Because Lance Henderson is the star of the TV series.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.880
So I don't know what this world is that Lance has to go

18:28.880 --> 18:31.280
rent his own copy of Millennium, the series,

18:31.840 --> 18:33.840
on a videocassette, presumably.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.200
But I always get a kick out of that story.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.360
Do y'all want a yahoo?

18:40.000 --> 18:40.560
Yeah, please.

18:40.560 --> 18:44.480
So I'm gonna send him by riding high Zoe Kinski.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.840
Thank you Zoe, it's yahoo answers user.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.200
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.400
I'm gonna try one refresh.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.760
I'm gonna give this a little bit of bandwidth

18:49.760 --> 18:54.320
and see if we can't, no, this dog won't bark.

18:54.320 --> 18:59.840
It's from Joey who asks, I am naming all of my pants.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.600
Let's start with the torn Wranglers

19:01.600 --> 19:03.600
with spaghetti sauce on the left leg.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.320
Any ideas?

19:04.320 --> 19:05.440
I'm very fond of them.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.960
It's just like a fun way of like categorize,

19:08.960 --> 19:11.520
like you need to know, you need to know,

19:11.520 --> 19:13.760
like you open up the drawer and it's like,

19:13.760 --> 19:15.280
what jeans do I want to wear today?

19:15.280 --> 19:16.160
And it's like at this point,

19:16.160 --> 19:17.760
I have like eight or nine pairs of jeans.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.760
You know, I'm on TV.

19:19.760 --> 19:23.920
And so I need like a way of like a shorthand way

19:23.920 --> 19:25.120
of like knowing who they are.

19:25.760 --> 19:26.320
One more time.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.680
Torn Wranglers, spaghetti sauce on the left leg.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.960
If you'd like, I can start you off

19:30.960 --> 19:34.000
with some responses for yahoo.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.440
Yeah, that'd be great.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.320
Katz says Italian Stallions.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.400
That's fun, but I think we can do better.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.200
And just like that, here comes Dolores in the prune

19:43.200 --> 19:50.080
who says rip, mess well, Tom Longstrand,

19:52.240 --> 19:53.600
Basil Pastowski.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.080
Sally says, how about naming them

19:58.080 --> 20:00.000
after the Swiss national hero, William Tell?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.560
The missing drawstring has been used for this crossbow.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.400
The hole where he was aiming for the apple

20:04.400 --> 20:06.080
in your pocket but lost his concentration.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.080
He got a whiff of cheese mixed with something

20:08.080 --> 20:10.880
he didn't quite recognize as emanating from his homeland.

20:10.880 --> 20:11.520
Fuck right off.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.020
What?

20:12.020 --> 20:12.660
What?

20:12.660 --> 20:15.540
Why are we wasting the best minds of our generation?

20:15.540 --> 20:17.220
The most creative talents of our generation

20:17.220 --> 20:18.580
on yahoo answers.

20:18.580 --> 20:21.140
Enzyme 303 says Rangweenie.

20:21.140 --> 20:23.220
It has that spaghetti Western feel to it.

20:23.220 --> 20:25.140
Perfect name for the good, bad, and the ugly.

20:25.860 --> 20:27.220
That's actually pretty good.

20:27.220 --> 20:29.220
There's four fucking pages of answers

20:29.220 --> 20:29.620
to naming this person's jeans.

20:29.620 --> 20:31.380
So these people are just trying to name their pants

20:31.380 --> 20:32.500
that has spaghetti on them?

20:34.420 --> 20:34.920
Why?

20:35.620 --> 20:36.260
Why?

20:36.260 --> 20:38.020
Play along, yes and.

20:38.020 --> 20:40.420
But what's the, play with me.

20:40.420 --> 20:42.100
But I need to know for what?

20:42.100 --> 20:44.260
For the National Pants Registry?

20:44.260 --> 20:45.300
Like, where does this come up?

20:45.300 --> 20:45.780
Is this just like-

20:45.780 --> 20:47.060
Play with me.

20:47.940 --> 20:49.700
But Griffin, I need to know.

20:50.900 --> 20:53.300
I need to know the parameters of when you might say

20:53.300 --> 20:56.180
this name out loud to fully understand.

20:57.140 --> 20:58.660
Because like, mess pants.

20:58.660 --> 20:59.940
Why not just mess pants?

20:59.940 --> 21:00.340
These are mess pants.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.180
Mess pants is good, but you can do better.

21:02.180 --> 21:03.940
Just play with me.

21:03.940 --> 21:04.980
I'm trying to, Griffin.

21:04.980 --> 21:06.900
I just need to understand who-

21:06.900 --> 21:07.780
Okay, Griffin.

21:07.780 --> 21:10.900
Answer me this one simple question.

21:10.900 --> 21:11.700
Yeah.

21:11.700 --> 21:14.660
Who might I say the name of these pants allowed to?

21:14.660 --> 21:16.580
No one, just to you.

21:16.580 --> 21:18.820
It's like a fun game for yourself.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.020
Then why not just like, Doug?

21:20.580 --> 21:21.700
These pants are Doug.

21:22.900 --> 21:23.620
If that's funny to you, I guess.

21:23.620 --> 21:25.140
I'm gonna put on Doug.

21:25.140 --> 21:25.700
If that's funny to you-

21:25.700 --> 21:27.700
I put my legs inside Doug.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.300
See, now it's getting better.

21:29.300 --> 21:30.820
Doug's a little worse for wear.

21:30.820 --> 21:32.660
Doug got some sauce on Doug.

21:32.660 --> 21:38.020
Got some Doug, now your name is Rip Meswell.

21:38.020 --> 21:39.780
Tom Longstrand.

21:42.340 --> 21:44.580
I'll be honest, I'll part the curtain a little bit here.

21:45.380 --> 21:48.100
I did include this question just because I wanted to put up

21:48.100 --> 21:50.420
these amazing names from Dolores and the Prune.

21:50.420 --> 21:52.820
Rip Meswell, Tom Longstrand, and Basil Pistowski.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.460
Basil Pistowski is my favorite.

21:55.460 --> 21:56.180
It's very good.

21:56.180 --> 21:58.580
And I thought maybe we could get in there and play along.

21:58.580 --> 22:00.660
But apparently you boys don't want to play my new game

22:00.660 --> 22:01.620
that I came up with for you.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.300
I just, Griffin, I don't-

22:03.300 --> 22:04.340
No, it's fine.

22:04.340 --> 22:05.140
I just don't know.

22:05.940 --> 22:07.140
I just don't know.

22:07.140 --> 22:07.620
It's fine.

22:08.340 --> 22:09.300
How about a different one?

22:09.300 --> 22:10.980
We'll get you guys back in your comfort zone.

22:11.540 --> 22:12.020
Okay.

22:12.020 --> 22:14.340
This one was sent in by a lot of folks.

22:14.340 --> 22:15.380
Well, two folks.

22:15.380 --> 22:17.700
Nicholas Potter and Christian Ang with Syntheson.

22:17.700 --> 22:18.260
Thank you.

22:18.260 --> 22:20.020
It's from Yahoo Answers user Justin.

22:20.020 --> 22:20.420
Uh oh.

22:22.020 --> 22:22.580
Not me.

22:22.580 --> 22:26.260
Justin started his account on Christmas Day

22:26.260 --> 22:28.020
and put this one up on Christmas Day.

22:28.020 --> 22:28.740
Thank you, Justin.

22:28.740 --> 22:34.980
Justin asks, do dogs know they are dogs?

22:36.180 --> 22:36.820
Oh shit.

22:37.460 --> 22:37.860
Yeah.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.420
So I think now you'll play.

22:40.420 --> 22:41.860
Now you'll play with me.

22:41.860 --> 22:42.420
Because I think if-

22:42.420 --> 22:44.420
Do dogs know they are dogs?

22:44.420 --> 22:46.500
You think about this and you think who gives a shit,

22:46.500 --> 22:49.700
but then you also think about Marmaduke,

22:49.700 --> 22:51.620
the dog who thinks he's a person.

22:53.300 --> 22:56.100
So if he exists,

22:56.100 --> 22:58.740
he exists?

22:58.740 --> 22:59.140
Okay.

22:59.140 --> 23:01.380
Let's establish this baseline just for those people

23:01.380 --> 23:03.460
screaming at your podcast player,

23:03.460 --> 23:04.980
your Victrola or whatever.

23:06.260 --> 23:09.540
I think that dogs very clearly can see themselves

23:09.540 --> 23:11.700
and other dogs and humans and be like,

23:11.700 --> 23:12.660
we're definitely,

23:13.300 --> 23:14.820
there's something different here.

23:14.820 --> 23:17.460
The question for me at least is,

23:17.460 --> 23:19.380
do they register like,

23:19.380 --> 23:21.060
well, those people own us.

23:21.780 --> 23:23.460
We are their pets.

23:23.460 --> 23:26.020
So they are definitely above.

23:26.020 --> 23:27.140
I don't know if they go that far,

23:27.140 --> 23:31.700
but I do think they regard us as like the Tallstriders

23:31.700 --> 23:32.900
and the food god,

23:34.100 --> 23:37.700
you know, who reigns their benevolence down upon us.

23:38.980 --> 23:43.860
I feel like dogs know other dogs are dogs.

23:43.860 --> 23:44.260
Yeah.

23:44.260 --> 23:46.340
But they kind of feel bad for those guys.

23:46.340 --> 23:47.380
Oh, I see.

23:47.380 --> 23:50.100
Look at all those guys that are owned by people

23:50.100 --> 23:52.340
and man, that must be a rough putt for them.

23:52.340 --> 23:53.380
I feel bad for dogs.

23:53.380 --> 23:54.660
I don't feel like dogs.

23:54.660 --> 24:00.500
Dogs probably see themselves as small humans on four legs

24:00.500 --> 24:02.340
and then they see other dogs as dogs.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.020
Like there's an air of superiority.

24:04.020 --> 24:04.740
I feel like.

24:04.740 --> 24:05.540
Really?

24:05.540 --> 24:07.860
All dogs are kind of up their own butts a little bit.

24:08.420 --> 24:09.220
A little bit.

24:09.220 --> 24:10.260
Well, that would make a lot of sense.

24:10.260 --> 24:12.660
They are always trying to get up their own butts.

24:13.220 --> 24:14.580
Yeah, that would explain it.

24:15.860 --> 24:16.820
You'd think that they,

24:18.340 --> 24:19.780
this is a tough one.

24:19.780 --> 24:21.140
Do you think they'd be bummed out

24:21.140 --> 24:23.460
or is this just the world that they know?

24:23.460 --> 24:25.060
What do you think they think of cats?

24:25.940 --> 24:28.020
Yeah, I mean, now we're really getting into it.

24:29.060 --> 24:33.220
Like, I think we can all look at a cat that lives in the house with them.

24:33.220 --> 24:34.420
Is the cat like,

24:34.420 --> 24:37.380
yeah, me and the other humans just putting up with this thing.

24:37.940 --> 24:43.540
I think we can all agree that they do look at us as giant gods,

24:44.420 --> 24:47.860
as giant, like giant powerful figures.

24:47.860 --> 24:48.580
You know what I mean?

24:48.580 --> 24:51.060
Like they worship, they worship us unto a god.

24:51.620 --> 24:52.660
That's all Striders.

24:52.660 --> 24:53.940
I actually think Griffin,

24:53.940 --> 24:55.780
you have really touched a nerve for me

24:55.780 --> 24:57.940
because this is my problem with raccoons

24:57.940 --> 24:59.700
is I spend so much time with dogs.

24:59.700 --> 25:00.900
Finally, we're getting to the heart of it.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.740
I know, let's really get down to it.

25:02.740 --> 25:04.500
I spend so much time with dogs

25:04.500 --> 25:08.740
who like very clearly recognize that I am a superior being.

25:08.740 --> 25:10.580
And then there's like a raccoon in my garbage

25:10.580 --> 25:11.540
and I'm like, blah.

25:11.540 --> 25:13.220
And it looks at me like, fuck you.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.420
And just keeps doing what it's doing.

25:14.420 --> 25:17.380
I'm like, no, this is not how this is supposed to go.

25:17.380 --> 25:19.060
And raccoons know they're raccoons, right?

25:19.060 --> 25:21.700
But raccoons don't recognize my divinity is what I'm saying.

25:21.700 --> 25:22.500
Right, exactly.

25:22.500 --> 25:22.980
So-

25:22.980 --> 25:24.020
Yes, that's a good point.

25:24.020 --> 25:25.940
I think horses are, I think equally,

25:25.940 --> 25:27.700
I think horses are just ambivalent, right?

25:27.700 --> 25:28.980
Like horses know they're horses

25:28.980 --> 25:30.740
and I think they're one of the few animals

25:30.740 --> 25:32.900
that are like, yeah, I'm a fucking horse.

25:32.900 --> 25:34.340
Check, guess what?

25:34.340 --> 25:35.620
That I just told you.

25:35.620 --> 25:38.100
So, and I think that they're totally fine with it.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.500
And I don't even think they would refer,

25:40.500 --> 25:42.500
I don't think they would think of us as gods at all.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.780
I think, cause they're taller than us

25:43.780 --> 25:46.420
and they have like way more legs, like twice as many.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.900
So shoot.

25:48.900 --> 25:50.180
I think when we ride a horse,

25:50.180 --> 25:53.220
I think the horse is like, what a cool favor I'm doing.

25:53.220 --> 25:55.860
What about when a dog sees you on a horse?

25:56.500 --> 25:58.260
Now that's probably like,

25:58.260 --> 26:00.820
I don't know why all dogs don't just instinctively shit

26:00.820 --> 26:01.540
when they see that.

26:02.340 --> 26:04.180
Like, what do we even do now?

26:04.180 --> 26:06.900
The one thing I had on them was I had four legs

26:06.900 --> 26:08.980
and now they have six.

26:08.980 --> 26:11.460
This would be essentially like seeing

26:11.460 --> 26:19.140
like God giving like a bigger God a piggyback ride somehow.

26:19.140 --> 26:21.460
Like, I don't even understand how that visual would pan out.

26:21.460 --> 26:23.460
I bet the harder thing for dogs

26:23.460 --> 26:25.860
is when they see people get off a horse.

26:25.860 --> 26:27.220
Like, no, what are you doing?

26:27.220 --> 26:29.300
You just figured, no, what are you?

26:29.300 --> 26:30.420
Are you crazy?

26:30.420 --> 26:31.380
Get back on there.

26:31.940 --> 26:32.740
What are you doing?

26:32.740 --> 26:34.020
Why would you ever get off?

26:34.020 --> 26:35.220
Do you think that when animals,

26:36.100 --> 26:38.420
we human beings have made such a big deal

26:38.420 --> 26:41.380
out of animal pairings and like weird animal pairings.

26:41.380 --> 26:44.500
But I guarantee that like most animals are just like,

26:44.500 --> 26:46.260
yep, you, me, yep.

26:46.260 --> 26:48.100
Like horse is just a bigger dog.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.140
Dogs are just smaller horses.

26:49.140 --> 26:51.700
Travis, are you sure you haven't seen Zootopia?

26:54.900 --> 26:55.780
You got the message.

26:55.780 --> 26:56.660
You got it, dude.

26:56.660 --> 26:58.180
Like you've got, it's a great,

26:58.180 --> 26:58.980
you should watch it

26:58.980 --> 27:01.140
because you've already got it's good message in your heart.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.060
And I guess I don't need it.

27:04.660 --> 27:05.940
That's how I look at movies.

27:05.940 --> 27:07.940
Do I already know that that thing is bad?

27:07.940 --> 27:09.300
I don't need that movie.

27:09.300 --> 27:10.020
I've got it.

27:10.020 --> 27:11.540
I already know to guard the galaxy.

27:11.540 --> 27:12.340
Thank you very much.

27:13.220 --> 27:17.380
I have a new segment on the show.

27:17.380 --> 27:19.140
Is it just another question or is it like a new?

27:19.780 --> 27:21.620
No, it's a new segment I invented.

27:21.620 --> 27:24.180
It's called Guy Another Day.

27:24.180 --> 27:25.780
And it's a Guy Fieri update.

27:25.780 --> 27:27.060
Just like checking in on Guy.

27:27.700 --> 27:30.020
Guy Fieri, see what he's into.

27:30.020 --> 27:30.580
All right.

27:30.580 --> 27:33.380
Wait, like minute by minute, like right now, what is he doing?

27:33.380 --> 27:35.140
No, just like when he does something notable.

27:36.020 --> 27:36.420
Okay.

27:36.420 --> 27:41.380
My wife sent me a quote from a real interview

27:41.380 --> 27:44.580
that Guy Fieri did with a vice property called Munchies.

27:45.460 --> 27:48.980
And they asked him where Flavortown was.

27:50.260 --> 27:51.300
Have you guys seen this?

27:51.300 --> 27:54.340
No, but I would really like to make guesses as to his answer.

27:54.340 --> 27:58.740
Just fucking hold on for literally,

27:58.740 --> 28:00.420
probably the quote of your life.

28:00.420 --> 28:00.900
Oh my God.

28:01.940 --> 28:03.860
I want this to be my Yuletide.

28:03.860 --> 28:06.740
Okay, here we go.

28:06.740 --> 28:08.500
On camera, I once said,

28:08.500 --> 28:11.380
this pizza looks like a manhole cover in Flavortown.

28:11.940 --> 28:12.900
I'm sorry.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.740
I know that's not the funny part of the quote,

28:14.740 --> 28:16.420
but I hadn't heard that one before.

28:17.220 --> 28:19.860
Willy Wonka had a chocolate stream, you know?

28:20.660 --> 28:23.620
So it's taking these iconic food items,

28:23.620 --> 28:26.580
these iconic food moments and giving them a home.

28:27.380 --> 28:28.820
They all live in Flavortown.

28:29.780 --> 28:31.700
It's like one of those things in the matrix.

28:31.700 --> 28:34.660
You can only get down with Flavortown

28:34.660 --> 28:36.180
if you believe in Flavortown.

28:37.060 --> 28:38.580
I have people walk up to me and say,

28:38.580 --> 28:40.900
hey, I'm a citizen of Flavortown.

28:41.700 --> 28:43.140
I have people that want to pledge

28:43.140 --> 28:45.300
to be a city council member of Flavortown

28:45.940 --> 28:47.620
or the mechanic.

28:48.340 --> 28:49.380
It doesn't stop.

28:49.380 --> 28:51.860
Their names are Justin, Travis, and Griffin McElroy.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.140
They email me every week.

28:54.020 --> 28:56.180
What would be the airline of Flavortown?

28:56.820 --> 28:58.100
Sausage Airlines?

28:58.100 --> 29:00.340
Wait, I'm reading the fucking quote.

29:00.340 --> 29:03.460
He, within his own statement about Flavortown,

29:03.460 --> 29:07.700
began to pose his own questions to flesh out the universe.

29:08.420 --> 29:10.420
What would be the airline of Flavortown?

29:10.420 --> 29:12.260
What would be the titles of the Star Wars movies

29:12.260 --> 29:13.220
in Flavortown?

29:14.100 --> 29:15.060
Sausage Airlines?

29:15.780 --> 29:16.740
It just doesn't stop.

29:17.700 --> 29:20.340
I just said it and then people heard it.

29:20.340 --> 29:23.220
Goes all the way to the top.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.780
Here's the fucking cherry on this bad boy.

29:25.780 --> 29:29.460
Of course, there's no Flavortown unless you believe in it.

29:29.460 --> 29:32.340
Oh my God, you scared me so bad because of course I do.

29:32.340 --> 29:35.060
You scared me fucking really, really bad for a second there, guy.

29:35.060 --> 29:37.300
What do you think, as long as we're going down

29:37.300 --> 29:39.380
this hypothetical road, Mr. Fieri,

29:40.020 --> 29:45.140
what do you think mayoral elections are like in Flavortown?

29:45.140 --> 29:47.620
Do you think it's based on who's most flavorful,

29:47.620 --> 29:50.740
who can bring, protect the most flavor,

29:50.740 --> 29:52.660
who can bring the most flavor from outside?

29:52.660 --> 29:54.900
Is it like I've traveled afar

29:54.900 --> 29:57.300
and I've brought you new flavors to Flavortown

29:57.300 --> 30:00.180
or it's like Pizza the Hut, the mayor of Flavortown?

30:00.180 --> 30:04.500
I think there's an electoral college system

30:04.500 --> 30:06.340
just on a very local, hyper-local level

30:06.980 --> 30:10.020
and then I think that results in two candidates

30:10.020 --> 30:12.260
and then they have a buffalo wing eating contest.

30:13.620 --> 30:20.020
Do you think, what role does Mr. Fieri play in politics

30:20.020 --> 30:21.220
and the running of Flavortown?

30:21.220 --> 30:22.100
Doesn't, doesn't, doesn't.

30:22.100 --> 30:22.740
Are you fucking kidding me?

30:22.740 --> 30:25.780
Guy Fieri wandered into Flavortown

30:25.780 --> 30:27.700
as one might wander into Narnia

30:27.700 --> 30:28.980
and discovered it's dark secret.

30:28.980 --> 30:33.380
He was transformed by a satyr.

30:34.900 --> 30:35.700
Interesting.

30:35.700 --> 30:40.580
And then he returned to us through his magic pizza oven

30:40.580 --> 30:43.940
he climbed out of and he, somebody was like,

30:43.940 --> 30:47.700
what the fuck happened to your hair and face and body?

30:47.700 --> 30:50.260
And he was like, I don't know, it got wild over there.

30:50.260 --> 30:52.900
These sunglasses are fused to the back of my head.

30:52.900 --> 30:53.460
Yeah, and then.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.940
They're hot, those are covering the eyes that he uses

30:55.940 --> 30:59.700
to watch his back constantly in case Flavortown comes for him

30:59.700 --> 31:01.940
because they do send, they're called reclaimers

31:02.580 --> 31:05.060
and what they do is they escape,

31:05.060 --> 31:08.100
they are given permission to walk in our world

31:08.100 --> 31:12.180
and if you speak of Flavortown, then they're hunting you.

31:12.180 --> 31:13.460
They're basically hunting people

31:14.100 --> 31:17.220
who can let their secret be known.

31:17.220 --> 31:19.140
But then Jason, why does Mr. Fieri,

31:19.940 --> 31:21.700
like why does he draw their wrath?

31:21.700 --> 31:23.540
He could just stay quiet about Flavortown.

31:23.540 --> 31:24.980
Oh, because he stole their fucking secrets.

31:26.020 --> 31:29.460
And also he's very good with his spark lance.

31:29.460 --> 31:32.100
That's one of the weapons that he took from Flavortown

31:32.100 --> 31:36.580
from the armory and when the reclaimers come for Guy Fieri,

31:37.300 --> 31:39.940
he uses the spark lance that he stole from Flavortown

31:39.940 --> 31:40.820
to defend himself.

31:41.940 --> 31:44.980
And that's why he must always be on the move,

31:44.980 --> 31:47.940
moving from diner to drive in to dive.

31:47.940 --> 31:50.260
Never stopping, never sleeping.

31:50.260 --> 31:52.580
That's why they play the sad, incredible Hulk music

31:52.580 --> 31:54.740
at the end of every episode of Dive, Drives and Dives

31:54.740 --> 31:56.260
because he's on the way.

31:56.260 --> 31:57.940
He's gotta keep on the move

31:57.940 --> 31:59.700
because they're always looking for it.

31:59.700 --> 32:00.500
This does make sense

32:00.500 --> 32:04.500
because I actually went to a restaurant not two days ago

32:04.500 --> 32:07.300
that had one of those like guy's been here panels

32:07.940 --> 32:09.380
and I always thought that was like,

32:09.380 --> 32:10.660
because we're on the show and now I'm thinking

32:10.660 --> 32:12.500
maybe it's like a memorial plaque

32:12.500 --> 32:14.420
because like he finished filming

32:14.420 --> 32:17.140
and then bought off like four reclaimers

32:17.140 --> 32:18.900
saved all of our lives.

32:18.900 --> 32:22.660
Yeah, if they see, if you ever see one of those plaques

32:23.220 --> 32:25.300
just to stay near it for a while

32:25.300 --> 32:27.220
and eventually you'll see someone come in

32:27.220 --> 32:30.500
that looks like a predator made out of fettuccine Alfredo

32:30.500 --> 32:31.620
and that's a reclaimer.

32:31.620 --> 32:33.940
That's what a reclaimer is.

32:33.940 --> 32:34.500
It's just-

32:34.500 --> 32:35.940
Sorry, a fettitor?

32:35.940 --> 32:37.860
No, no, no, no, no.

32:37.860 --> 32:39.780
Maybe it's made of feta, would that be better?

32:40.340 --> 32:41.220
It's not really.

32:41.940 --> 32:45.140
It's just Guy and his hot rod and his spark lance

32:45.140 --> 32:46.660
just driving from place to place

32:46.660 --> 32:49.460
just trying to find the secret that's gonna get

32:49.460 --> 32:52.500
the Flavortown reclaimers off of his back

32:52.500 --> 32:54.900
and really the last Final Fantasy game

32:54.900 --> 32:57.220
was loosely based off of Guy Fieri's story

32:58.420 --> 32:59.780
it's kind of like a cool crossover.

32:59.780 --> 33:01.540
Here's what the history books don't tell you.

33:02.180 --> 33:05.300
There was actually a time at which Flavortown

33:05.300 --> 33:07.540
and our world were one.

33:07.540 --> 33:08.500
Interesting.

33:08.500 --> 33:09.780
And they actually were torn apart

33:09.780 --> 33:12.980
though there is a small like Venn diagram overlap

33:12.980 --> 33:15.780
in the pizza oven that Mr. Fieri uses to travel

33:15.780 --> 33:17.380
betwixt the two planes.

33:17.380 --> 33:22.180
Now Mr. Fieri is trying to draw them back into overlap.

33:22.180 --> 33:24.900
That world was called the personal Pangea, right?

33:24.900 --> 33:25.780
Correct.

33:25.780 --> 33:28.740
And so Mr. Fieri is trying to pull the two worlds

33:28.740 --> 33:29.940
back into alignment.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.380
But now the government of Flavortown

33:34.020 --> 33:35.380
realizes that if that happens

33:35.380 --> 33:38.900
they will lose all the control over their delicious citizens

33:38.900 --> 33:42.580
that they've come to rely on and really bask in.

33:42.580 --> 33:44.740
So they're trying to stop the convergence,

33:44.740 --> 33:46.180
the flavor convergence.

33:46.180 --> 33:47.460
The flavor singularity,

33:47.460 --> 33:51.460
because if he's unsuccessful it's gonna happen

33:51.460 --> 33:53.060
and we're gonna get like a shot

33:53.060 --> 33:56.820
of like an eight-year-old in Iowa or something

33:56.820 --> 34:01.460
and she bites into a crisp, a honey crisp apple

34:01.460 --> 34:04.100
and just fucking pizza sauce spills out of it.

34:04.100 --> 34:05.940
She's like, mama, something's wrong.

34:06.500 --> 34:07.700
And then you look up into the sky

34:07.700 --> 34:09.860
and it's just noodles, zesty noodles falling out.

34:09.860 --> 34:12.180
Well, that's the thing is like right now

34:12.180 --> 34:16.740
everything you taste is maybe 1% of what the actual flavor is.

34:16.740 --> 34:18.100
You would die.

34:18.100 --> 34:21.060
If you got a fucking unfiltered Flavortown

34:21.060 --> 34:21.780
you would be destroyed.

34:21.780 --> 34:23.380
This is like the giver, right?

34:24.100 --> 34:26.500
Only Mr. Fieri remembers flavor

34:27.060 --> 34:28.980
and he has to tell us about it

34:28.980 --> 34:31.460
because flavor has been removed from our lives.

34:31.460 --> 34:33.300
But if this convergence happens

34:33.300 --> 34:36.660
the flood of flavor would knock your tongue

34:37.300 --> 34:38.660
out the back of your head.

34:38.660 --> 34:39.140
Yeah.

34:39.140 --> 34:40.820
And I'm not speaking metaphorically here.

34:40.820 --> 34:43.060
Yeah, it would knock your tongue.

34:43.860 --> 34:46.980
The secret is, and the thing that they're really trying

34:46.980 --> 34:49.060
to keep him from is there is a tower

34:49.700 --> 34:52.740
that connects our world to Flavortown.

34:52.740 --> 34:54.900
And in order to get to, you have to follow,

34:54.900 --> 34:56.660
they call them cream beams.

34:56.660 --> 34:59.300
They're beams made of different cream sauces.

34:59.940 --> 35:03.540
And you can follow them to the tower that unites.

35:04.820 --> 35:07.620
And the man who controls it all is the sorcerer.

35:07.620 --> 35:11.380
And the sorcerer defends the cream beams

35:11.380 --> 35:14.660
but he also tries to keep interlopers out.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.780
So he has to sneak past the sorcerer

35:17.780 --> 35:20.020
to get into Flavortown every time.

35:20.020 --> 35:22.660
It's truly a miraculous tale

35:22.660 --> 35:24.500
when you really sit down and think about it.

35:24.500 --> 35:25.700
If I can just stop for a second

35:25.700 --> 35:26.820
because we always forget to do this.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.500
Fucking TM, TM, TM, TM.

35:28.500 --> 35:29.860
Well, no, hold on, sorry.

35:29.860 --> 35:31.780
We can't TM Guy Fieri.

35:31.780 --> 35:32.820
I'm sorry, fellas.

35:32.820 --> 35:34.340
No, we can't do that.

35:34.340 --> 35:35.780
Okay, but it's fair use.

35:35.780 --> 35:40.660
TM, Big Giant Head LLC, TM, us, don't steal this one.

35:40.660 --> 35:43.460
This one's got cinematic potential.

35:43.460 --> 35:44.900
This one's a movie.

35:44.900 --> 35:46.660
This one's our money maker.

35:46.660 --> 35:48.580
This is the one we can finally retire on.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.780
Can we make a movie about the sorcerer

35:51.780 --> 35:53.380
who controls the all pillar

35:53.380 --> 35:55.780
that connects our world to Flavortown

35:55.780 --> 35:59.220
and our quartet across the cream beams

36:00.500 --> 36:02.740
without including Mr. Fieri at all?

36:02.740 --> 36:04.820
Because I don't actually know that that would be a good hang.

36:04.820 --> 36:06.900
I feel like the story is bigger than him at this point.

36:06.900 --> 36:10.900
Yeah, I feel like if he won't get on board, somebody will.

36:10.900 --> 36:13.460
Well, name our main character Guy Fieri.

36:14.340 --> 36:15.300
Oh, that's good.

36:17.460 --> 36:19.860
Listen, if we're gonna fund this film,

36:19.860 --> 36:22.020
we're gonna need some outside investment

36:22.020 --> 36:24.820
and just to get that kick started,

36:24.820 --> 36:26.660
let's head on over to the Money Zone.

36:26.660 --> 36:39.060
Do you want to shave your goatee?

36:39.060 --> 36:40.500
Sure, we all do.

36:40.500 --> 36:44.500
Hi, I'm Travis McElroy speaking specifically to Guy Fieri now.

36:47.140 --> 36:48.980
This week we're sponsored by Harry's.

36:48.980 --> 36:52.100
Mr. Fieri, I really think this may be the product for you.

36:52.100 --> 36:54.820
That pesky facial hair, you've tried everything.

36:54.820 --> 36:57.620
You've tried clippers, you've tried hedge trimmers,

36:57.620 --> 37:00.100
you've tried like sheep to eat off your face.

37:00.100 --> 37:02.660
You've used the spark lance, like be honest.

37:02.660 --> 37:04.020
And nothing has worked.

37:04.020 --> 37:06.340
Well, might I recommend Harry's razors?

37:08.740 --> 37:12.420
It's got five German engineer blades, a lubricating strip,

37:12.420 --> 37:14.260
flex hinge for a comfortable glide,

37:14.260 --> 37:16.340
trimmer blade for hard to reach places

37:16.340 --> 37:19.380
like the back of your head where your glasses are fused to

37:19.380 --> 37:21.140
and weighted ergonomic handle.

37:21.140 --> 37:23.540
Harry's started with just two guys, Jeff and Andy,

37:23.540 --> 37:25.780
then they bought a factory with a hundred years

37:25.780 --> 37:27.060
of blade making experience

37:27.060 --> 37:29.060
so they could make their own high quality razors,

37:29.060 --> 37:31.540
sell them online and ship them directly for half the price.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.860
You don't have to go to stores and wait for someone

37:33.860 --> 37:38.260
to unlock a cage and pay $50 for two blades.

37:38.260 --> 37:40.340
Instead, just check it out.

37:40.340 --> 37:42.340
All that stuff I mentioned, the five engineer blades,

37:42.340 --> 37:45.940
the lubricate, all that, that's $2 a blade.

37:46.660 --> 37:48.660
That's such an amazing deal.

37:48.660 --> 37:51.220
And Harry's is so confident in the quality of their blades.

37:51.220 --> 37:55.220
They want you to try their most popular trial set for free.

37:55.220 --> 37:56.980
It comes with a razor handle of your choice,

37:56.980 --> 37:59.060
five blade cartridge and shaving gel.

37:59.060 --> 38:02.260
Free when you sign up, just pay a small fee for shipping.

38:02.260 --> 38:03.940
If you want to redeem that trial offer,

38:03.940 --> 38:10.940
go to harrys.com, H-A-R-R-Y-S.com slash my brother right now.

38:10.940 --> 38:13.780
That's harrys.com slash my brother.

38:14.740 --> 38:15.620
Can I talk about Blue Apron?

38:15.620 --> 38:18.820
Cause it's really, I like it a lot.

38:18.820 --> 38:19.140
Yes.

38:19.140 --> 38:20.340
Nope, I'm just going to do it.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.420
I don't need to bother asking for permission.

38:22.420 --> 38:23.620
Folks, when you eat Blue Apron,

38:23.620 --> 38:26.020
you will think you have stolen the secrets of Flavortown

38:26.020 --> 38:28.020
for yourself, which is ridiculous

38:28.020 --> 38:29.860
because you would almost certainly be destroyed

38:29.860 --> 38:33.780
by the woodland satyrs and the fairy circles.

38:33.780 --> 38:36.260
You would be trapped in their endless dance.

38:36.260 --> 38:40.020
But they are going to send you the most flavorful food

38:40.020 --> 38:41.860
without having to risk this deadly journey,

38:41.860 --> 38:43.940
this deadly voyage.

38:43.940 --> 38:45.860
For less than 10 bucks per person, per meal.

38:45.860 --> 38:48.020
And what they send is seasonal recipes

38:48.020 --> 38:49.860
along with pre-portioned ingredients

38:49.860 --> 38:51.860
that you can use to make delicious home-cooked meals.

38:51.860 --> 38:54.660
Stuff like salmon piccata with orzo and broccoli,

38:54.660 --> 38:56.740
pork chops and miso butter with bok choy

38:56.740 --> 38:58.740
and marinated apple, vegetable chili

38:58.740 --> 39:00.900
and baked sweet potatoes with crispy tortilla strips.

39:00.900 --> 39:03.620
Sometimes these like featured upcoming meals,

39:03.620 --> 39:06.340
really almost every time they are stuff

39:06.340 --> 39:08.100
that we haven't gotten yet.

39:08.100 --> 39:10.180
And so this is like actually an exciting sneak preview

39:10.180 --> 39:12.900
for me, a diehard Blue Apron fan.

39:12.900 --> 39:14.820
A diehard Blue Apron subscriber.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.340
Like, ooh, pork chops and miso butter.

39:16.340 --> 39:17.140
Don't mind if I do.

39:18.100 --> 39:18.820
It's really great.

39:18.820 --> 39:21.860
I've had it going for like almost,

39:21.860 --> 39:23.220
I feel like almost a year now

39:23.220 --> 39:26.900
and I didn't know how to cook very good beforehand.

39:26.900 --> 39:30.100
And now I'm getting pretty good and I love cooking.

39:30.100 --> 39:31.540
And it was like a thing that I never thought

39:31.540 --> 39:32.980
I would sort of get good at.

39:34.420 --> 39:35.780
So it's really great.

39:35.780 --> 39:37.060
And you can check out this week's menu

with Blue Apron, so don't wait.

39:47.780 --> 39:50.580
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

39:50.580 --> 39:52.900
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

39:52.900 --> 39:56.180
I got a message for Valley and it's from David.

39:56.180 --> 39:57.780
It says, hey Valley, hello.

39:58.420 --> 40:00.420
I'm talking to you right now Valley.

40:00.420 --> 40:01.860
I am in fact speaking to you

40:01.860 --> 40:03.700
from inside the mouth of a McElroy brother.

40:04.260 --> 40:06.420
It's a disturbing image.

40:06.420 --> 40:08.580
I have to say it feels pretty good in here.

40:08.580 --> 40:11.300
Happy birthday Valley.

40:11.860 --> 40:13.620
I hope you have a good day

40:13.620 --> 40:15.780
and that your tentacles can continue to creep

40:15.780 --> 40:18.020
in all sorts of places over the next year.

40:18.020 --> 40:20.100
You are absolutely amazing.

40:20.100 --> 40:22.180
Well, this goes on to some places.

40:22.180 --> 40:24.260
Yeah, that took my mouth some places.

40:24.260 --> 40:26.100
I don't like the idea that I'm in Tomatown

40:26.100 --> 40:28.020
controlled by in like a meet Dave scenario,

40:28.020 --> 40:29.700
but that's fine.

40:29.700 --> 40:32.740
Happy birthday Valley.

40:32.740 --> 40:34.180
It's a birthday one.

40:34.180 --> 40:35.620
That one was by me, by the way.

40:35.620 --> 40:38.500
No one could, no one made me do that.

40:38.500 --> 40:39.860
I have a message for Daniel

40:39.860 --> 40:41.780
and it's from your older sister Julia

40:41.780 --> 40:45.060
who says happiest birthday to my fourth favorite brother.

40:45.060 --> 40:47.620
Thanks for infecting me with my bim bam mania.

40:47.620 --> 40:50.580
You're one of the smartest and funniest people I know

40:50.580 --> 40:52.180
and you have excellent taste in podcasts,

40:52.180 --> 40:55.300
motorcycles, tattoos, and music.

40:56.260 --> 40:58.340
I don't know why that has a bunch of, yeah.

40:59.140 --> 41:00.260
Only a few more years

41:00.260 --> 41:01.940
until we're in a nursing home together,

41:01.940 --> 41:03.780
day drinking and wearing diapers.

41:03.780 --> 41:04.740
That's the dream.

41:04.740 --> 41:06.260
I love you very much.

41:06.900 --> 41:07.620
You know, Griffin,

41:07.620 --> 41:10.420
you on a very recent episode of Rosebuddies

41:10.420 --> 41:15.060
talked about how like the different jumbotrons

41:15.060 --> 41:18.260
for each show had their own kind of like themes,

41:18.260 --> 41:19.940
you know, and like with the Rosebuddies,

41:19.940 --> 41:21.860
it's like all about love and adventure zone.

41:21.860 --> 41:23.780
It's all about like D&D groups.

41:23.780 --> 41:24.100
Yeah.

41:24.100 --> 41:25.460
And my brother and my brother and me,

41:25.460 --> 41:29.300
we have a recurring like gentle insult thing

41:29.300 --> 41:31.460
that happened like you're my fourth favorite brother

41:31.460 --> 41:32.660
and you have tentacles.

41:32.660 --> 41:34.740
It's good-natured ribbing,

41:34.740 --> 41:40.260
but it's also like psycho sexual control over us

41:40.260 --> 41:42.180
and like the glee that people feel

41:42.180 --> 41:44.340
like I'm making a McElroy say stuff.

41:45.140 --> 41:47.460
It feels good in this soft mouth.

41:48.900 --> 41:49.780
It's very upsetting.

41:50.500 --> 41:51.460
I mean, yeah.

41:51.460 --> 41:52.500
Thank you for your support.

41:52.500 --> 41:53.140
Thank you for your support.

41:53.140 --> 41:54.500
If you would like to control our mouths,

41:54.500 --> 41:57.540
you can go to maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron.

41:57.540 --> 41:59.300
And then cry because there's nothing.

41:59.860 --> 42:01.140
Yeah, for not this year,

42:01.140 --> 42:03.700
you can weep and gnash your teeth.

42:03.700 --> 42:05.380

42:38.180 --> 42:39.620
We've only done one question,

42:39.620 --> 42:41.220
so I'm gonna do another question.

42:41.220 --> 42:42.260
Well, what about a Yahoo?

42:43.220 --> 42:45.060
But we've only done one question

42:45.060 --> 42:46.660
and you did two Yahoos.

42:46.660 --> 42:47.460
That's a good point.

42:49.780 --> 42:52.500
I started dating my longtime friend recently.

42:52.500 --> 42:54.740
I noticed a horseback riding trophy on his dresser

42:54.740 --> 42:56.100
and asked him about it.

42:56.100 --> 42:58.500
He said that as a youth, he did trick riding

42:58.500 --> 43:01.300
and could even do handstands while the horse was in motion.

43:02.740 --> 43:05.060
When asked to do a handstand, he refused,

43:05.060 --> 43:07.380
saying it's easier to do on a horse.

43:09.460 --> 43:11.700
Brothers, is my new boyfriend a liar?

43:11.700 --> 43:14.900
How can I get him to back up his claims of sick tricks?

43:14.900 --> 43:19.620
That's from riding high or hiding lies in Kings County.

43:19.620 --> 43:20.340
Ah, damn it.

43:21.300 --> 43:22.180
I got so excited

43:22.180 --> 43:24.020
because you said you're dating your longtime friend.

43:24.020 --> 43:26.100
In my mind, I was just like, oh, what a love.

43:26.100 --> 43:30.900
But then this is a pretty big lie.

43:30.900 --> 43:32.340
Like this is a pretty major lie.

43:32.340 --> 43:38.740
And it tells you that this person is willing to lie about,

43:38.740 --> 43:40.420
and if they'll lie about this,

43:40.420 --> 43:44.100
they'll lie about literally anything for fun.

43:44.100 --> 43:47.380
But they do have a trophy.

43:50.100 --> 43:53.380
Okay, I will not deny the fact

43:53.380 --> 43:58.500
that it is possible to handstand while riding on a horse.

43:58.500 --> 44:01.540
I think it's going to require a pretty fucking good jockey

44:01.540 --> 44:03.860
and a pretty fucking good horse.

44:03.860 --> 44:10.740
A broad horse that has a real flat-backed literal pommel horse

44:10.740 --> 44:12.100
is what we're talking about here.

44:13.300 --> 44:16.500
Is it easier to do that on the ground

44:16.500 --> 44:20.580
that doesn't have shifting meat and bones inside of it?

44:20.580 --> 44:23.540
No, no, no, no, no, of course not.

44:23.540 --> 44:24.100
No, it's-

44:24.100 --> 44:26.420
Counterpoint, counterpoint, counterpoint, counterpoint.

44:26.420 --> 44:29.380
This is gonna have to be a fucking pretty good counterpoint.

44:29.380 --> 44:33.700
Perhaps this boyfriend from birth

44:34.500 --> 44:37.380
was only trained to handstand on a horse.

44:37.380 --> 44:40.260
They have never done it on a flat surface before.

44:41.860 --> 44:47.380
So it's like, maybe he's from a family of fucking trick riders

44:47.380 --> 44:50.020
because otherwise, how do you accidentally get into it?

44:50.020 --> 44:53.540
How, if your family is not horse people, do you at like six

44:53.540 --> 44:58.500
be like, mom, dad, parents, folks, I want a trick ride?

44:58.500 --> 44:58.740
And your parents are like, okay.

44:58.740 --> 45:02.180
Travis, I love you and I know this is all for the joke

45:02.180 --> 45:05.380
and it's a joke show full of goofs and spoofs.

45:06.260 --> 45:10.820
There's no reality in which the first time you try a handstand

45:11.380 --> 45:14.420
it's on a horse that simply does not track.

45:14.420 --> 45:15.460
Cannot be done.

45:15.460 --> 45:16.180
It cannot be-

45:16.180 --> 45:17.460
You're right, you're right, you're right.

45:17.460 --> 45:20.980
A pony, you have to grow up together to establish that trust.

45:20.980 --> 45:22.340
Thank you, Justin.

45:22.340 --> 45:23.460
You are right.

45:23.460 --> 45:26.500
At two years old, you had a new foal.

45:26.500 --> 45:28.100
You handstand on the foal.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.380
You grow up together.

45:29.380 --> 45:30.900
You died and the pony died.

45:32.100 --> 45:34.340
I think if you try to do a handstand on a pony and you die

45:34.340 --> 45:36.900
I think the pony is also sort of summarily killed.

45:38.340 --> 45:40.100
I think the pony's also destroyed.

45:40.100 --> 45:41.140
You killed my boy.

45:41.140 --> 45:45.460
You weak back baby horse.

45:48.260 --> 45:49.380
It's just not true.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.860
It can't be done, it's not.

45:51.860 --> 45:54.420
Okay, the two things that bother me the rest of this.

45:54.420 --> 45:58.100
One, he is objectively lied by saying it's easier on a horse.

45:58.100 --> 45:59.860
That's a lie.

45:59.860 --> 46:02.180
Good on you for your lie detector going off.

46:02.740 --> 46:06.740
As far as proof, there is no reality in which

46:06.740 --> 46:09.220
if I did a handstand on a horse

46:09.220 --> 46:12.260
I would not be wearing a shirt that says take your fucking phone out

46:12.260 --> 46:15.220
and get ready to take a picture of this sick shit I'm about to do.

46:15.220 --> 46:18.500
Everybody would be ready to take a picture of me

46:18.500 --> 46:22.020
doing a handstand on a horse if I was about to do that.

46:22.580 --> 46:23.780
Absolutely.

46:23.780 --> 46:24.580
There would be pictures.

46:24.580 --> 46:26.660
Alternate theory, alternate theory I have now.

46:28.260 --> 46:34.180
This boyfriend is hiding a traumatic handstand horse event similar to-

46:34.180 --> 46:35.060
They're all traumatic.

46:35.060 --> 46:40.980
There's been tops four non-traumatic handstand horse activities.

46:40.980 --> 46:42.580
This is just like in the Kingkiller Chronicles

46:42.580 --> 46:44.500
when it's like Kvothe doesn't do magic anymore.

46:44.500 --> 46:46.180
It doesn't play music and we're all like-

46:46.180 --> 46:47.060
What happened, yeah.

46:47.060 --> 46:47.940
But why?

46:47.940 --> 46:49.780
In book three of your relationship,

46:49.780 --> 46:51.860
book one was longtime friends.

46:51.860 --> 46:54.180
Book two, boyfriend.

46:54.180 --> 46:58.500
Book three, in book three of your relationship with this person

46:58.500 --> 47:00.420
you're going to find out what happened

47:00.420 --> 47:02.420
and oh, it's going to be so, it's-

47:02.420 --> 47:04.340
Listen, I don't want to build this up.

47:04.340 --> 47:06.020
I don't want to give you false hope.

47:06.020 --> 47:08.420
It's going to be the sickest story you've ever heard.

47:08.420 --> 47:10.660
It doesn't matter how long it takes book three

47:10.660 --> 47:12.020
of your relationship to come out.

47:13.620 --> 47:14.420
Take your time.

47:15.300 --> 47:17.700
Horse handstand Patrick Rothfuss.

47:17.700 --> 47:19.380
Take your time and polish it up.

47:20.100 --> 47:20.980
Get it ready.

47:20.980 --> 47:22.100
Get it ready for us.

47:23.780 --> 47:29.700
But it's going to be the fucking sickest shit ever.

47:29.700 --> 47:34.260
Now, in the meantime, don't press your partner too hard here

47:34.260 --> 47:36.740
because this third silence is his.

47:36.740 --> 47:39.300
He'll give you the story when he's ready for it.

47:40.580 --> 47:44.580
But it's going to be incredible.

47:44.580 --> 47:45.460
Incredible.

47:45.460 --> 47:46.820
Do you guys want to yahoo?

47:46.820 --> 47:47.620
Yes, please.

47:47.620 --> 47:48.120
Yes.

47:49.540 --> 47:52.260
This one, well, there's another one that's like-

47:52.260 --> 47:53.300
Give me a name for a thing.

47:53.300 --> 47:53.860
But I feel like we-

47:53.860 --> 47:55.300
Well, we didn't really do that with the jeans

47:55.300 --> 47:58.020
because you fellas didn't really want to play along

47:58.020 --> 47:59.060
and play my game.

47:59.060 --> 47:59.860
Let's just do this one.

47:59.860 --> 48:01.140
Or maybe I'll do two more.

48:01.140 --> 48:02.580
This one's from Irham Waisessa.

48:02.580 --> 48:03.220
Thank you, Irham.

48:03.220 --> 48:05.140
It's by yahoo answer's user, They Are Anonymous.

48:05.140 --> 48:07.860
So I'm going to say also Joey.

48:07.860 --> 48:09.620
Joey is a very curious young man.

48:10.420 --> 48:14.580
Joey asks, what's a good name for a posh all boys school?

48:15.860 --> 48:17.140
Pesto pants.

48:17.140 --> 48:20.500
Travis, God, saucy slacks.

48:20.500 --> 48:23.140
I fucking can't believe you guys.

48:26.660 --> 48:28.100
Okay, a good name.

48:28.100 --> 48:31.460
A good name for a fancy boys school.

48:33.380 --> 48:35.220
Wait, was it posh or fancy?

48:35.220 --> 48:36.580
Posh all boys school.

48:36.580 --> 48:39.220
If you're about to become the headmaster of-

48:39.220 --> 48:43.060
I think we can all agree that's the dream.

48:44.260 --> 48:48.100
How about Professor Xavier's school for okay kids?

48:52.020 --> 48:54.020
And you can go and you can still get the patch.

48:54.020 --> 49:01.300
And yes, we do have a cool futuristic jet, but just the kids are just kind of okay.

49:01.860 --> 49:07.860
How about Lord Zachary Quillington's Institute for Refinement and Math?

49:07.860 --> 49:08.740
Also math.

49:08.740 --> 49:09.380
Also math.

49:09.380 --> 49:12.420
Well, maths, if we're going to get fancy on it.

49:12.420 --> 49:24.420
How about Benedict Cumberbatch's home for sharp faced boys?

49:24.420 --> 49:24.980
Welcome.

49:26.020 --> 49:27.780
So glad you could join us.

49:27.780 --> 49:28.500
Is that him?

49:29.060 --> 49:30.580
I'm Benedict Cumberbatch.

49:33.860 --> 49:37.220
You, doughy faced young man, how did you get in?

49:38.020 --> 49:39.620
Get this dough boy out.

49:39.620 --> 49:42.260
Round features.

49:43.460 --> 49:48.100
I shall leave you in the competent hands of my co-teacher, Eddie Redmayne.

49:50.500 --> 49:54.420
And then Eddie Redmayne just kind of like morphs out of him.

49:54.420 --> 49:57.780
They just sort of like cellularly divide and then they're-

49:59.140 --> 50:01.300
And our sister, Tilda Swinton.

50:01.300 --> 50:02.740
Yes, all of- yeah, excellent.

50:03.620 --> 50:08.340
Take yourself to Brendan Gleason's school for round boys.

50:08.340 --> 50:09.300
Round boys.

50:15.060 --> 50:19.860
That's where you belong, at Brendan's Institute of Ill Repute.

50:19.860 --> 50:22.100
Though fucking when that dodgeball game happened-

50:22.100 --> 50:23.620
That's exactly what I was about to say.

50:23.620 --> 50:25.300
This fucking go-kart race.

50:26.100 --> 50:26.580
Yes.

50:26.580 --> 50:31.540
And think of the hilarious, like one of the sharp faced boys gets hit by a ball, ball deflates.

50:31.540 --> 50:32.900
Ball deflates, hysterical.

50:32.900 --> 50:33.380
That's good, that's solid.

50:35.460 --> 50:36.180
Fucking great.

50:36.180 --> 50:37.460
I don't need- we're done.

50:37.460 --> 50:39.540
No need to go further into this one.

50:39.540 --> 50:40.820
Yeah, that's great.

50:40.820 --> 50:41.620
We answered that.

50:41.620 --> 50:42.580
We helped that person.

50:43.140 --> 50:43.940
We helped someone.

50:45.940 --> 50:50.740
I live in a college dorm and an improv group recently started meeting every night.

50:50.740 --> 50:52.420
No, that's too much improv.

50:52.420 --> 50:53.460
That's too much of it.

50:53.460 --> 50:54.180
It's too much.

50:56.020 --> 51:00.660
Take it from somebody who tried to do that for three weeks straight, making a TV show.

51:00.660 --> 51:01.300
It's too much.

51:01.300 --> 51:02.180
You can't do that much.

51:02.180 --> 51:03.380
You can't be funny, all of it.

51:03.380 --> 51:05.620
The problem is their improv is really bad.

51:05.620 --> 51:10.420
I used to use the common room to cook dinner for myself, but it's hard to focus on cooking the food

51:10.420 --> 51:14.420
that I need to live while they're literally rolling around the ground in front of me.

51:15.220 --> 51:18.420
These are people that I need to face in class the next day.

51:18.420 --> 51:19.380
How can I cope?

51:19.940 --> 51:22.100
That's from Just Hungry in Baltimore.

51:22.100 --> 51:24.260
Oh, fucking shit.

51:25.300 --> 51:26.420
That's a legit problem.

51:27.060 --> 51:34.420
At what point, if one is constantly doing improv, does that differ from just living your life

51:34.420 --> 51:36.420
every day?

51:36.420 --> 51:38.420
Whoa.

51:38.420 --> 51:39.380
Whoa.

51:39.380 --> 51:40.340
Wait, what?

51:40.340 --> 51:40.660
What?

51:40.660 --> 51:41.620
Well, because like every day-

51:41.620 --> 51:42.820
That sounded insightful.

51:42.820 --> 51:44.820
And then my other brain is like-

51:44.820 --> 51:47.220
Yeah, your left lobe was like, no, no, no, that was dumb.

51:47.220 --> 51:47.700
No, no, no.

51:47.700 --> 51:48.900
That didn't make any sense.

51:48.900 --> 51:54.020
But what I'm saying is if you walk into these people doing this every day and you leave and

51:54.020 --> 51:59.780
they're still doing it, how do you know that they're doing an event and that this is just

51:59.780 --> 52:02.180
not the way they've chosen to live their lives?

52:02.180 --> 52:03.380
It doesn't fucking matter.

52:03.380 --> 52:06.340
I'm trying to make my spaghetti over here.

52:08.900 --> 52:15.940
You just bumped into me doing a little skit about how you guys are shoveling coal into

52:15.940 --> 52:16.580
a train engine.

52:16.580 --> 52:18.900
Oh, you fucking punched me while you were doing that.

52:18.900 --> 52:22.820
Why are you doing improv right fucking next to me while I'm trying to live my life?

52:22.820 --> 52:26.420
You know they're so desperate for inputs and prompts that they're definitely going to

52:26.420 --> 52:31.140
incorporate, hey, Luigi, pass me the sauce over here.

52:31.140 --> 52:32.820
I've got to put the pepper in it.

52:32.820 --> 52:34.820
Like, can you just not?

52:34.820 --> 52:36.740
Can you please, please?

52:36.740 --> 52:40.340
Oh, oh, instant ramen again.

52:40.340 --> 52:41.220
Uh oh.

52:41.220 --> 52:42.660
I don't know why I'm doing this.

52:42.660 --> 52:44.500
Michael, you don't need to do that voice right now.

52:44.500 --> 52:44.980
You're right.

52:46.020 --> 52:46.500
You're right.

52:46.500 --> 52:51.540
The problem with cooking your dinner is every night you have to come equipped with a readily

52:51.540 --> 52:55.620
available place, career, and funny situation.

52:55.620 --> 52:56.660
Just call it out.

52:56.660 --> 52:57.620
Anybody, anybody.

52:57.620 --> 52:58.980
I'm the only one here.

52:58.980 --> 53:04.900
It's like the weirdest three billy goats, answer me these riddles three, a place, a

53:04.900 --> 53:06.740
profession, and a food.

53:08.020 --> 53:09.460
This stinks.

53:09.460 --> 53:12.260
Maybe this is like their answer to improv anywhere.

53:12.260 --> 53:16.020
And this is like improv in one specific place forever.

53:16.020 --> 53:16.980
Improv where you are.

53:17.620 --> 53:18.100
Here.

53:18.100 --> 53:18.980
Improv here now.

53:18.980 --> 53:19.780
Now here.

53:19.780 --> 53:22.100
Improv where Jim is making spaghetti.

53:22.100 --> 53:23.060
Improv at Jim.

53:24.260 --> 53:25.060
Just don't.

53:25.060 --> 53:28.180
Improv should be, I get uncomfortable with the improv.

53:28.180 --> 53:28.820
Jim improv.

53:28.820 --> 53:29.620
Fucking shit.

53:29.620 --> 53:33.300
I get uncomfortable with the improv everywhere stuff because it's like improv should be a

53:33.300 --> 53:36.500
thing that I agree to.

53:37.220 --> 53:40.100
I am going to go to an improv tonight.

53:40.100 --> 53:42.900
I said while living in Chicago, not so much here in Austin.

53:42.900 --> 53:45.940
Tonight I will go to an improv and I would go to it.

53:45.940 --> 53:48.820
It cannot come to me because I'm doing other things right now.

53:49.380 --> 53:51.220
I don't have time for you improv.

53:51.220 --> 53:53.140
Oh, time to watch the season finale of Lost.

53:53.700 --> 53:54.740
Are you sure?

53:55.540 --> 53:56.420
Ding dong.

53:56.420 --> 53:59.060
Cuckoo cuckoo.

53:59.060 --> 53:59.460
Uh oh.

53:59.460 --> 54:00.740
Somebody feed that duck.

54:01.380 --> 54:01.940
Stop it.

54:02.580 --> 54:02.900
Stop.

54:02.900 --> 54:04.260
I got to know what happens to Sawyer.

54:05.860 --> 54:06.260
Uh oh.

54:06.260 --> 54:07.540
My toilet's broke.

54:07.540 --> 54:08.340
I've got it.

54:08.340 --> 54:09.380
Don't worry about it.

54:11.380 --> 54:11.700
Stop.

54:11.700 --> 54:12.340
He's stabbing me.

54:12.340 --> 54:13.140
He's stabbing me.

54:14.020 --> 54:15.540
No, I'm not stabbing you.

54:15.540 --> 54:18.740
I'm improv.

54:19.700 --> 54:20.900
Can you not do this?

54:20.900 --> 54:23.300
I'm in a movie with my kid.

54:23.300 --> 54:24.820
We're seeing trolls too.

54:24.820 --> 54:27.540
Can you fucking please not do this in the movies right now?

54:28.740 --> 54:29.380
Excuse me, sir.

54:29.380 --> 54:33.140
I'd like to see your ticket or else I'll have to kick you off the train.

54:34.180 --> 54:34.660
Stop it.

54:34.660 --> 54:36.100
It's not a train.

54:36.100 --> 54:36.900
It's not a train.

54:36.900 --> 54:38.100
I'm at Trolls 2 with my kid.

54:39.140 --> 54:40.340
Please.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.660
Oh, you got to take this and turn it to your advantage.

54:44.660 --> 54:48.020
If you're like, I can't wait to see Trolls 2, but I'm not able to go tonight.

54:48.020 --> 54:52.180
You know, then you go to the common room and you just shout out like Trolls 2.

54:52.900 --> 54:53.940
Then they're just like.

54:53.940 --> 54:54.980
That's good.

54:54.980 --> 54:57.380
Can you guys do how you think Trolls 2 goes?

54:58.500 --> 55:01.140
Let me walk you through Trolls 1.

55:01.140 --> 55:03.860
Okay, so the Bergens have to eat trolls to be happy.

55:04.740 --> 55:05.380
Get comfortable.

55:05.380 --> 55:06.660
There's a lot of twists and turns.

55:09.300 --> 55:10.500
I don't see anybody taking notes.

55:12.180 --> 55:14.820
Folks, that's going to do it for us on our improv show.

55:16.500 --> 55:19.540
If you do improv, I hope I didn't upset you just then.

55:19.540 --> 55:20.180
Never did it.

55:20.180 --> 55:22.260
Don't quite understand the craft.

55:22.260 --> 55:28.020
I know it's not all people doing make-believe professions on each other, but.

55:28.020 --> 55:30.020
Yes, there's heralds involved.

55:30.020 --> 55:30.900
I know that.

55:30.900 --> 55:31.940
Yeah, yeah.

55:31.940 --> 55:32.580
That's part of it.

55:34.660 --> 55:37.060
Anyway, thank you for listening.

55:38.180 --> 55:40.180
So we've got a TV show now.

55:40.900 --> 55:42.820
It's on a service called CISO.

55:42.820 --> 55:44.260
You can get CISO at CISO.com.

55:44.260 --> 55:46.740
That's S-E-E-S-O.com.

55:47.620 --> 55:50.420
They got a free week so you can go check it out and see what you think.

55:50.420 --> 55:51.700
There's a ton of great stuff on there.

55:51.700 --> 55:55.460
And I think you're just going to go gaga over it besides our show.

55:55.460 --> 55:59.460
But in addition to our show, I was going to say, if you've already checked it out,

55:59.460 --> 56:00.740
and you're like, I watched the show.

56:01.780 --> 56:09.460
We just put up a deleted scenes and an eight minute blooper reel for the first episode.

56:09.460 --> 56:11.380
And there's going to be more of that coming.

56:11.380 --> 56:13.940
So even though all six episodes went up on the same day,

56:13.940 --> 56:17.140
there's going to be more bonus content coming out periodically.

56:17.140 --> 56:19.940
Yeah, we're talking like 15 minutes of stuff went up today.

56:19.940 --> 56:21.780
So there's a lot on there.

56:21.780 --> 56:26.180
They've got an app you can get on the Roku and Apple Store.

56:26.180 --> 56:28.260
And you can watch through Amazon Prime.

56:28.260 --> 56:29.940
And you could subscribe to CISO through that.

56:29.940 --> 56:31.700
But check it out.

56:31.700 --> 56:32.580
It's a great service.

56:32.580 --> 56:37.780
And the feedback to our show has just, everybody's been really, really kind about it.

56:37.780 --> 56:40.820
And we just really, really appreciate it.

56:40.820 --> 56:46.260
If it came together at all, by the way, it has only like partially to do with us

56:46.260 --> 56:49.140
and mainly to do with like the amazing people that we work with,

56:49.140 --> 56:53.620
like Greg and Jackie, JD, Seth and Alex and New and everybody,

56:54.500 --> 56:57.140
Steve and everybody who worked on the show.

56:57.140 --> 56:58.420
So thank you to all of them.

56:58.420 --> 57:02.420
And thank you to you all for watching it and letting us know what you think.

57:03.060 --> 57:06.180
I just want to say thank you to everybody for watching it and sharing it with friends.

57:06.180 --> 57:09.060
We've seen a lot of like listening parties, a lot of people like tweeting it,

57:09.060 --> 57:12.020
saying like, I sat down with my wife and she's never listened to the show before.

57:12.020 --> 57:12.900
And she loved it.

57:12.900 --> 57:18.980
Like that kind of stuff makes me so happy to see like people not only supporting our show,

57:18.980 --> 57:22.180
but also like supporting other people seeing it.

57:24.020 --> 57:27.140
It makes me feel very warm and fuzzy inside.

57:27.140 --> 57:28.100
So thank you very much.

57:29.700 --> 57:31.300
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winter,

57:31.300 --> 57:34.340
who used our theme song, It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed,

57:34.340 --> 57:40.180
which I, boy, I hope you've purchased that album in some way now.

57:40.180 --> 57:43.940
They've been letting us use it for almost 350 episodes and it's a really good album.

57:43.940 --> 57:44.900
I think you're really going to dig it.

57:45.860 --> 57:47.940
We also want to say go check out all the other amazing shows

57:47.940 --> 57:49.300
on MaximumFun.org.

57:49.300 --> 57:50.420
There's a ton on there.

57:51.780 --> 57:54.740
A lot of them we're on, but all of them are great.

57:54.740 --> 57:56.660
I'm a big fan of every show on the network.

57:56.660 --> 57:57.940
No exaggeration.

57:57.940 --> 58:00.420
Coming up is the Max Fun Drive, which we'll tell you all about.

58:00.420 --> 58:03.860
But if you're new to the show since last March-ish,

58:05.140 --> 58:08.100
we've got a chance for you coming up to help support this show

58:08.100 --> 58:09.700
and the other shows on Max Fun that you love.

58:09.700 --> 58:11.140
So stay tuned for that.

58:12.260 --> 58:15.780
The important thing is there's going to be a lot of bonus content

58:15.780 --> 58:17.700
and a lot of new stuff for you to listen to.

58:17.700 --> 58:19.460
So it's a very exciting time.

58:22.100 --> 58:22.500
Anything?

58:22.500 --> 58:24.340
Oh, you can go to McElroyShows.com.

58:24.340 --> 58:27.220
Also, if you want to check out all the stuff we're involved in.

58:28.340 --> 58:29.140
I just made it.

58:29.140 --> 58:30.500
Squarespace is not a sponsor this week,

58:30.500 --> 58:33.860
but I made my own website in Squarespace over the weekend.

58:33.860 --> 58:35.460
You did so good, Griffin.

58:35.460 --> 58:36.820
Thank you, Travis.

58:36.820 --> 58:37.700
Great website.

58:37.700 --> 58:42.100
It looks so good that it made me feel like I need to update TravisMcElroy.com.

58:42.100 --> 58:43.700
GriffinMcElroy.com, for a long time,

58:43.700 --> 58:47.940
was just referring to my Tumblr that I never fucking used,

58:47.940 --> 58:49.620
and it was embarrassing, so.

58:49.620 --> 58:54.260
And JustinMcElroy.com is for a Canadian reporter, I believe.

58:54.260 --> 58:55.060
Do you have.org?

58:57.060 --> 58:59.380
Yeah, he got to the.com.

58:59.940 --> 59:01.300
We haven't talked about that recently,

59:01.300 --> 59:03.620
but I don't really appreciate him doing that.

59:03.620 --> 59:04.980
I think.org might be available.

59:06.580 --> 59:07.780
Or.pizza.

59:07.780 --> 59:09.220
I used to have a website.

59:09.220 --> 59:10.580
I did have a website.

59:10.580 --> 59:12.260
You had one for a bit, though.

59:12.260 --> 59:13.460
Yeah, I had one for a grit.

59:13.460 --> 59:14.740
I mean, I have my WordPress.

59:15.300 --> 59:16.100
Yeah, that's weird.

59:16.100 --> 59:17.380
But I don't know, that's weird.

59:17.380 --> 59:20.660
Anyway, don't have the WordPress either,

59:20.660 --> 59:21.860
so don't go hunting for it.

59:22.900 --> 59:25.860
Except on Christmas, apparently updated during Christmas time

59:25.860 --> 59:27.220
with my favorite playlist.

59:27.220 --> 59:27.860
I'm looking at it now.

59:27.860 --> 59:29.540
That's all I have is just Christmas playlists.

59:31.540 --> 59:33.700
That's all of our show.
