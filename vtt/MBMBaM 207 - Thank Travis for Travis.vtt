00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:44.480
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.160
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother,

00:46.160 --> 00:49.280
main advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:49.280 --> 00:53.840
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm a sweet baby Griffin.

00:53.840 --> 01:01.440
Been an exciting week here at the McElroy Ranch. I'm down fourteeth, got my wisdoms yanked,

01:01.440 --> 01:03.920
so that's been amazing. Do you not understand that that's like

01:03.920 --> 01:07.840
this podcast moneymaker? Like Travis and I don't know shit about fuck,

01:07.840 --> 01:12.960
and you had all the wisdom in the world, and you gave it away just because it was for aesthetics,

01:12.960 --> 01:16.560
because your mouth was too wide. One of them was too beautiful.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.440
It was distracting in conversation. People couldn't focus on my ideas.

01:21.440 --> 01:25.200
My big ideas, my big world-changing ideas. Because of your giant back teeth.

01:25.200 --> 01:29.760
Because of your beautiful, shining, perfect back teeth, and one broken half,

01:29.760 --> 01:33.920
so it seemed like the time. Yeah, that's a good time to do it.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.960
Like you were just burning through your wisdom so quickly doing this show that

01:36.960 --> 01:40.560
that was part of your wisdom tooth had to like rot and fall off because you used it up.

01:40.560 --> 01:45.120
Mindfulness teaches us the importance of knowing when to let go of things, and for me,

01:45.120 --> 01:49.600
that knowing when to let go of my wisdom teeth was predicated on one of them breaking in half.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.560
Shattering. Did you go to your local Zen Center to have it removed?

01:52.560 --> 01:55.920
Jagged stalactite of chewing. Sorry, Travis.

01:55.920 --> 01:58.320
Did you go to your local Zen Center to have them removed?

01:58.320 --> 02:01.520
No, I went ahead and went allopathic on this one.

02:03.680 --> 02:08.800
What possible manner could a Zinster rip them bad boys out?

02:08.800 --> 02:14.080
Listen, anybody can remove teeth from anybody. I'm not recommending it, I'm just saying that like

02:14.080 --> 02:19.920
you get really centered, you focus, you focus on your breathing, pop, pop, pop, pop, teeth out.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.920
Travis, you had a momentous week too, right?

02:21.920 --> 02:29.440
I did. So my friends in LA are Lyft drivers, and I'm a big fan of the idea of Lyft and Uber.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.960
So like weed delivery?

02:31.520 --> 02:37.040
No, that would be awesome, but it is a service in which it's kind of like a crowdsourced taxi.

02:37.600 --> 02:41.440
So you sign up to be a driver and then they kind of, it's like Uber, Lyft and Uber, big fans.

02:41.440 --> 02:46.720
Okay, crowdsourced taxi, so it is in effect definitely usually weed delivery.

02:46.720 --> 02:52.480
Yes. And so I said, oh, I want to try that out mostly because I was just curious about

02:52.480 --> 02:56.000
what it was like to be a driver for them. So when I got back to Cincinnati,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
I signed up for it thinking that if I like it, when I moved to Los Angeles,

03:00.000 --> 03:01.280
I'll start doing it there.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.560
They'll already know you.

03:02.560 --> 03:05.200
Yes. I'll be an experience.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.160
Lyft and Louie, the world's greatest Lyft driver.

03:08.160 --> 03:13.360
Yes. And they'll be super impressed because my car will be so clean and I'll have the best hard

03:13.360 --> 03:14.560
candy in my-

03:14.560 --> 03:16.320
Traveling Trav's Gypsy Taxi.

03:16.880 --> 03:20.000
Which is what I spray painted on the car in anticipation for this.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Yeah, you did jump the gun it seems.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.960
Well, so what happened is, what's supposed to happen is you fill out your application and then

03:26.960 --> 03:31.600
you click a button that says like start mentor Lyft now or something like that.

03:31.600 --> 03:36.480
And then it contacts your mentor and then your mentor drives to you and then you drive around

03:36.480 --> 03:40.160
and that's kind of your training session. Well, so I filled out the application.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.160
I hadn't cleaned my car yet and I wasn't ready to go.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.440
So I kind of stopped.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.640
I stopped at that point.

03:45.520 --> 03:49.600
And then my mentor called me and was like, hey, let's just set up a time.

03:49.600 --> 03:53.360
So that way I can make sure that I'm free and available and in the area.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.240
And I said, okay, great.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.200
So we set up the time.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.520
So then we met on Wednesday.

03:57.520 --> 03:58.800
I'd scrubbed out my car.

03:58.800 --> 03:59.920
I'd like detailed it.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.600
I'd gone to town cleaning it.

04:01.600 --> 04:05.440
And we met, he gets in my car and he's like, okay, great.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.600
Now just hit the start mentor Lyft now.

04:07.600 --> 04:11.120
And I press it and a screen pops up letting me know that I,

04:11.760 --> 04:15.280
my application has been denied due to my driving record

04:18.640 --> 04:21.280
while Duder is sitting in my car.

04:21.280 --> 04:24.720
And his response was, ah, man, that sucks.

04:25.520 --> 04:28.640
Well, your car smells like farts anyway.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.400
So you wouldn't have passed so bye.

04:31.040 --> 04:35.360
It was just so awkward because he started looking on his phone to find out like the FAQs

04:35.360 --> 04:37.760
of why someone's driving record to be turned down.

04:37.760 --> 04:38.960
And it's like, it's cool, man.

04:38.960 --> 04:39.440
It's fine.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.720
Please get out of my car.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.280
It's all right.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.800
You don't realize this, but we've reached the end of the anecdote.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.040
So you need to move on with your life.

04:47.040 --> 04:50.000
I would offer to drive you somewhere, but clearly that is not prudent.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.840
I'm amazed that he stayed in the car any longer.

04:53.840 --> 04:57.760
Once he found out about you, I know the car is sitting still,

04:57.760 --> 05:01.280
but you are capable of some pretty wack shit behind the wheel of one of these bad boys.

05:01.280 --> 05:04.320
Well, so then it really, my favorite part was when he said,

05:04.320 --> 05:06.880
do you know why it would say that?

05:06.880 --> 05:13.920
I was like, bro, I'm not just going to run through all my vehicular rampages with you.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.600
That's very charitable.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.400
It's like when you're at the store and your credit card gets declined,

05:18.400 --> 05:20.000
you think it's their computers?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.840
No, I don't think it's their computers.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.160
You know, this card reader's really been acting up.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.360
I'm sure it's not you.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.840
Did you remember to activate it before?

05:27.840 --> 05:29.920
No, now that you mentioned it.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.520
And I cannot stress enough, I still really like the idea of Lyft and Uber.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.520
So I'm not at all knocking them.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.520
Because it was like, as I was sitting there going,

05:37.520 --> 05:39.920
are you still trying to get in their good?

05:39.920 --> 05:42.400
Do you think they did send them an email that was like,

05:42.400 --> 05:45.520
hey, so Travis here, why was that?

05:45.520 --> 05:48.960
I've learned a lot about myself and my body

05:48.960 --> 05:52.960
and like how that pertains to operating a motor vehicle over the past few years.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.520
So if you can look past all the, ah, shit, I wrecked.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.600
Because I was emailing you while I was driving.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.280
I wish it could be like my credit score,

05:59.280 --> 06:01.600
where if I could say like my wife is a way better driver

06:01.600 --> 06:04.320
and she'll be in the car with me the whole time.

06:04.320 --> 06:08.960
Listen, Curbed and Ubo and Lyfting,

06:08.960 --> 06:13.360
if you are listening, please, I love my brother.

06:13.360 --> 06:17.600
If there's a criteria that is more important to you

06:17.600 --> 06:21.520
than has good driving record, I can't imagine what it could be.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.680
Please don't let him smooth talk you into this.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.600
I'm just saying that, you know what I provide?

06:25.600 --> 06:27.760
You know what I provide as a Lyft driver, Justin?

06:27.760 --> 06:28.960
An experience.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.960
Oh God, that's not what anybody wants.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.000
That's what people play.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.760
Crazy taxi all the time.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.000
Yeah.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.800
They fucking played that level in Die Hard 3

06:36.800 --> 06:37.920
where you drove around the taxi,

06:37.920 --> 06:39.440
which I think was the whole game actually.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.160
Jesus Christ.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.200
No, it's one third of the game.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.720
Cause there was also, nevermind.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.160
No, that was a Die Hard trilogy game.

06:45.680 --> 06:49.360
But listen, but listen, nobody wants an experience in an Uber.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.080
They want absolute silence until they arrive at their destination.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.600
They don't want to get creeped on.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.160
Give them a hard candy.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.000
Don't fist them at all.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.640
I always get the feeling in Uber

06:58.640 --> 07:01.200
because often they pull up in such nice cars.

07:01.200 --> 07:04.720
I always get the feeling in Uber that the guy is like mid party.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.120
Like he just took someone cool to a party place

07:07.120 --> 07:08.800
and he has to do that again later,

07:08.800 --> 07:11.920
but he has time to work me in to take me to Shake Shack.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.400
Does it smell like Brad Pitt back there?

07:14.400 --> 07:14.800
It should.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.720
And there's a reason.

07:16.720 --> 07:17.680
A good reason.

07:17.680 --> 07:22.320
Maybe I like to, I prefer to think that he was mid drive with Brad Pitt

07:22.320 --> 07:24.400
and said, oh shit, I got an Uber request.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.040
Hop out.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.240
You gotta get out, Pitt.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.120
I'll swing back around.

07:27.120 --> 07:27.920
I don't know.

07:27.920 --> 07:28.880
Pop out, Bradley.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.160
I'll circle back around in BD.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.040
Let's help people.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.640
Recently, I didn't do anything this week.

07:38.880 --> 07:42.800
Recently, servers at a fast food chain I eat at regularly

07:42.800 --> 07:46.160
are starting to recognize me and know what I will order.

07:46.160 --> 07:46.960
Oh, boys.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.800
Is this a hint that I should back out?

07:48.800 --> 07:51.200
Should I start going to another restaurant?

07:51.200 --> 07:53.200
It's not that I don't enjoy being noticed,

07:53.200 --> 07:55.360
but eating at a single establishment

07:55.360 --> 07:58.880
so much that various workers who work different shifts

07:58.880 --> 08:01.200
know you and your food preferences,

08:01.200 --> 08:04.640
yet not even your own name seems like an easy way

08:05.280 --> 08:06.800
to a dangerous place.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.360
Should I take my lunches elsewhere?

08:09.360 --> 08:12.160
That's from Nervous in Newport.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.960
I don't ever remember on the show Cheers

08:14.960 --> 08:17.760
when Norm would walk in and everyone would yell Norm

08:17.760 --> 08:20.080
and he would go, maybe I should start going somewhere else.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.320
This is not a norm.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.520
What they're yelling is Filet-O-Fish meal.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.080
That's a stigma that I think is really unfair

08:30.080 --> 08:32.320
because how is that different from going to a local diner

08:32.320 --> 08:34.240
and they know you're going to get the BLT?

08:34.240 --> 08:36.640
Just because it's McDonald's, like, okay, great.

08:36.640 --> 08:37.840
You like McDonald's.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.520
Don't change your preference

08:39.520 --> 08:41.760
just because you're afraid people will judge you.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.360
That's not a good way to live your life.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.160
That's not a healthy-

08:44.160 --> 08:44.640
Travis, you sound like the-

08:44.640 --> 08:45.760
If you like the fucking Filet-O-Fish,

08:45.760 --> 08:47.040
then get the fucking Filet-O-Fish.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.200
You sound like the fat head guy right now.

08:49.200 --> 08:52.400
You sound like the guy from the hit documentary Fathead

08:52.400 --> 08:54.880
that sought to discredit,

08:55.600 --> 08:57.840
supersize me in everything that I did.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.360
Where you're just like, eat what you want.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.440
It is America and it's freedom.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.400
And I guess it's true.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.640
I guess it is America and I guess it is freedom.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.440
But if you only eat Filet-O-Fish, you're going to die.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.080
You don't say he only eats Filet-O-Fish.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.200
That's what he has for lunch.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.080
Travis, Travis, Travis, you're going to die.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.200
You're gonna die.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.720
Welcome to McDonald's.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.160
We got frozen meat.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.040
Apple pies.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.880
Yeah, I guess McRib is back,

09:28.880 --> 09:30.240
but you're not gonna be.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.120
You're gonna die.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.880
Don't do this.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.160
I will say, okay, let me addendum.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.080
Maybe vary it up.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.560
Doesn't mean you have to stop going there,

09:44.560 --> 09:46.800
but maybe only go there like once a week

09:46.800 --> 09:49.600
or try something different or go there once,

09:49.600 --> 09:52.080
you know, twice every two weeks, something like that.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.720
But maybe it just means that it's time

09:54.720 --> 09:56.560
for a little bit more variety in your life.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.400
I don't think that means you got to feel bad

09:58.400 --> 10:01.040
about wanting to eat there and wanting to have that food.

10:01.040 --> 10:01.680
I wouldn't.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.600
But like maybe change it up.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.080
Okay, I don't under, two points.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.720
One, I've always wanted to have that at,

10:08.720 --> 10:11.040
like in my hometown, I live in a small town.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.440
You would think there'd be places that I could go

10:13.440 --> 10:15.920
where people would say like, hey, it's the J-Man.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.120
How are you?

10:17.120 --> 10:18.480
Do you want the usual?

10:18.480 --> 10:19.200
Hey Hoopster.

10:19.200 --> 10:19.840
Hey Hoops.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.520
That happens at my local pita pit, I guess.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.280
There's probably other places now that I think of it,

10:25.280 --> 10:26.560
but not every place.

10:26.560 --> 10:27.600
I want it universal.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.600
Secondly, why are you going inside a fast food restaurant?

10:31.600 --> 10:33.120
I know we've talked about this before.

10:33.680 --> 10:34.720
It's an old chestnut.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.480
I don't understand why you're not just going

10:36.480 --> 10:37.440
through the drive-through.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.960
Maybe you could do that if you want to keep

10:40.960 --> 10:43.440
your filet-o-fish schedule because you have

10:43.440 --> 10:45.120
obsessive compulsive disorder.

10:45.120 --> 10:50.000
If you need 131, oh Jesus, 131, I need my crunch.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.520
Maybe you could just go through the drive-through

10:53.520 --> 10:55.680
like an adult.

10:55.680 --> 10:56.800
You know what sucks though?

10:56.800 --> 10:57.920
You know what really puts me off?

10:57.920 --> 10:59.440
It's not just the food that you're eating

10:59.440 --> 11:01.280
that's killing you from the inside out,

11:01.280 --> 11:02.160
like a parasite.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.960
It's that they don't know your name.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.960
You're in a relationship with this McDonald's

11:06.960 --> 11:08.560
or this, can we say Arby's?

11:08.560 --> 11:09.760
It's just a funnier name.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.280
You're in a relationship with this Arby's.

11:13.280 --> 11:16.240
We have the weirdest sponsorship deal with them.

11:16.240 --> 11:21.440
And like you, they don't give a shit about you.

11:21.440 --> 11:26.000
They just want to force feed their floppy,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.480
sloppy meats down your throat and then get

11:28.480 --> 11:30.080
your money in return for it.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.480
And the fact that they know what kind of meat

11:32.480 --> 11:34.880
you like but not your name, man, they just,

11:34.880 --> 11:36.080
they're not going to put in the effort.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.120
They don't love you like you know.

11:37.120 --> 11:40.320
They're just streamlining the process and saying

11:40.320 --> 11:44.640
like, okay, great, go ahead and start an Arby's McRib

11:44.640 --> 11:46.080
tickler, whatever.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.000
And that way you can just go ahead and like

11:48.000 --> 11:50.480
get your meal faster and be done with the exchange.

11:50.480 --> 11:56.160
Now the Arby's McRib tickler, that's the Arby's sandwich.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.280
With peanut butter on it.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.520
But it has like a stick in it,

11:59.520 --> 12:01.520
like one of those joke popsicle sticks.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.480
Uh-huh, correct.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.800
Because it just, it makes you like wait one more

12:04.800 --> 12:05.840
second for the sandwich.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.480
And that hesitation is what makes it so delicious.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.240
That sweet orgasmic moment.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.520
It's so right.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.280
You're in a bad relationship.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.360
You need to get out of this relationship.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.000
You need to get out.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.080
You need to get yourself a new man.

12:18.720 --> 12:22.320
Strong, strong, proud black man who's going to treat

12:22.320 --> 12:23.760
you like the queen you are.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.440
And that is not this Arby's.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.800
That's clearly, yeah.

12:27.440 --> 12:31.920
Is there a new fast food restaurant?

12:31.920 --> 12:33.200
Can you guys think of like,

12:34.800 --> 12:37.920
have you guys heard of that new hot fast food restaurant

12:37.920 --> 12:39.280
that just hit the scene?

12:39.280 --> 12:40.640
And it's really taken charge.

12:40.640 --> 12:45.040
That new fast food enterprise business that is really

12:45.040 --> 12:48.800
just like hit the scene in 2000, late 2012.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.600
And it's just like fucking growing rapidly.

12:51.600 --> 12:51.840
Nope.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.520
It's just pretty much, pretty much just Subway and BK,

12:55.520 --> 12:56.800
Taco Bell, Donald's Jack in the Box.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.560
No, here's what you gotta get.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.040
This is one of the great things about fast food

13:01.040 --> 13:04.560
is where you gotta catch them is that every once in a while

13:04.560 --> 13:08.160
a restaurant will get into their marketing groove of

13:08.160 --> 13:10.480
we're not bullshit anymore.

13:10.480 --> 13:14.000
Like, remember how Domino's, Domino's is like,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.720
hey, listen, we've been bullshit for a long time

13:16.720 --> 13:19.360
and our new thing is we're going to try.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.600
We're actually gonna like make a product.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.160
Carl's Jr. is like, we're doing Angus now.

13:24.160 --> 13:24.880
Get on board.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.760
Well, the Angus revolution hit a lot of different places.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.840
And I feel like the growth wasn't that hard.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.080
I feel like McDonald's even like put their foot down.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.840
Like, no, no Angus.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.120
The line must be drawn here.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.040
We're gonna use the same like earthworm shit

13:37.040 --> 13:39.440
that you idiots have been guzzling down.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.000
All right.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.120
How about a Yahoo?

13:43.120 --> 13:43.360
Yeah.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.720
We need to pick up the pace on these shows.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.320
I feel like we spend too long on questions.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.080
That was a deep well.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.120
There was a lot of comedy in there.

13:51.120 --> 13:54.320
We hit the advice nug and then we like sit on that nug

13:54.320 --> 13:55.440
for a long time.

13:55.440 --> 13:55.920
Yeah.

13:55.920 --> 13:56.800
This Yahoo was-

13:56.800 --> 13:57.840
They fixed that in editing.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.440
Our producer fixed that in editing.

13:59.440 --> 13:59.680
Yeah.

13:59.680 --> 14:00.240
Thanks, Jerry.

14:00.240 --> 14:00.800
Thanks, Scott.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.440
Oh, Jesus.

14:01.440 --> 14:01.840
Oh, shit.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.120
Is this thanks, Jerry or Scott?

14:03.120 --> 14:07.040
We should have fucking put in the effort.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.080
This one was sent in by-

14:10.720 --> 14:12.000
I'm Scott and Jerry.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.680
I'm Scott and Jerry Paulson.

14:13.680 --> 14:14.480
Are you eating right now?

14:14.480 --> 14:16.240
Or is that just the sound your gums make now?

14:17.280 --> 14:18.560
Your bloated ruined gums.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.880
It's just flappy slappy holes in there.

14:20.880 --> 14:21.760
No, I made some-

14:22.720 --> 14:23.280
I got a-

14:23.840 --> 14:30.480
For Father's Day, I got a donut maker from my mother-in-law

14:30.480 --> 14:32.960
who apparently wants me to celebrate Father's Day

14:32.960 --> 14:35.040
by not being around so long.

14:35.040 --> 14:35.280
Yeah.

14:36.080 --> 14:39.440
And so you decided the perfect time to consume said donuts

14:39.440 --> 14:42.160
was when you were six inches away from a microphone.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.840
Well, listen, I didn't know you guys were going to say

14:43.840 --> 14:45.920
all that funny stuff about Scott and Jerry.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.920
Justin, are you waiting?

14:49.920 --> 14:53.840
Are you listening to this podcast while performing it?

14:53.840 --> 14:57.520
Listening for pregnant pauses in which to sneak tiny hidden

14:57.520 --> 14:59.280
kisses into your donut?

14:59.280 --> 15:02.880
Here's the other thing that is occurring to me

15:03.840 --> 15:10.640
is that I did take that opioid about 20 minutes ago.

15:10.640 --> 15:11.280
Oh no.

15:11.280 --> 15:15.200
So I think the show is starting to turn on that axis.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.640
You riding the lightning right now.

15:16.640 --> 15:17.840
You're riding the dragon.

15:17.840 --> 15:18.880
The dragon made of lightning.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.120
Remember when I compared fast food chains

15:21.120 --> 15:23.200
to strong proud black men?

15:23.840 --> 15:27.200
That may be, I think at that point, the worm I have turned.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.320
Yeah.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.040
Let us continue.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.320
Sorry, Scott and Jerry.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.000
That's kind of making a lot of work for me.

15:32.000 --> 15:32.240
Yeah.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.560
He's really earning his paycheck this week.

15:34.560 --> 15:39.040
Is Yahoo sent by a diamond member level 150 shaman

15:39.040 --> 15:40.320
of Yahoo's Drew Davenport?

15:40.320 --> 15:40.800
Thank you, Drew.

15:41.760 --> 15:45.120
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Michael, who asks,

15:46.080 --> 15:48.720
is there anything I should know about before going

15:48.720 --> 15:51.040
to a nudist resort with family and friends?

15:52.880 --> 15:56.800
I'm 13 and my friend and his family are nudists.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.320
When I'm at his house, I strip down.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.680
So I'm perfectly comfortable with being

15:59.680 --> 16:01.200
around other people in the buff.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.520
My family aren't nudists, but they invited us to go

16:03.520 --> 16:05.600
to a resort with them and we all agreed.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.480
It will be me, my dad, my mom and my younger brother.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.080
He's nine if that provides help.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.320
I've read the official rules online,

16:12.320 --> 16:14.960
but I want to know about the social etiquette there.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.480
Now I thought a nudist resort or a nudist colony

16:18.480 --> 16:23.360
would go like outback steakhouse style of no rules just right.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.240
But apparently there are boundaries that exist.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.240
Okay, and I want to be really careful here.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.960
Like, hey, if you're a nudist, that's totally cool.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.600
Like that's your deal and I'm not going to judge you for that.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.400
It is weird to me.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.440
Do you think there are nudists that listen to our podcast?

16:38.080 --> 16:41.040
Yeah, all they've got is a smile and a pair of headphones

16:41.040 --> 16:42.000
and I respect them.

16:42.000 --> 16:42.880
They don't even have the headphones.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.080
It's just like everything.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.480
There's a rich subculture with rules that we'll never

16:46.480 --> 16:50.160
be able to understand or be respectful towards

16:50.160 --> 16:51.840
in the context of our show.

16:51.840 --> 16:52.560
We can respect them.

16:52.560 --> 16:53.760
I don't think anything's wrong with this.

16:53.760 --> 16:57.440
I'm just, and maybe this is like anathema to those people,

16:57.440 --> 17:02.480
but I feel like the idea of the nudist camp I'm into.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.040
Oh yeah, I'm way into that.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.320
Yeah, and I'm sure it's just hard bodies.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.440
Just sexiest hard bodies as far as the eye can see.

17:13.440 --> 17:14.400
Here's the thing.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.760
You kind of lose me with the kid angle.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.240
Yeah, I feel like a nine year old.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.800
What's that thing that the Amish do where like you hit

17:22.800 --> 17:24.720
a certain age and you go off into the world

17:24.720 --> 17:25.840
for like a couple of months.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.160
Rummikub, bagging, something like that.

17:30.160 --> 17:35.920
I feel like that should happen once you pass age 10

17:35.920 --> 17:37.120
to like age 18.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.360
Those eight years, you're not allowed to be there.

17:40.640 --> 17:44.800
Yeah, oh no, because you're going to be leaking fluids

17:44.800 --> 17:46.560
that you or I don't understand.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.920
Yeah, it should be like once you get old enough to realize

17:49.920 --> 17:53.520
that this is like a strange thing,

17:53.520 --> 17:55.120
you're not allowed there anymore.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.640
Until you get to a point where like,

17:56.640 --> 17:58.560
I've seen this in other contexts.

17:59.280 --> 18:03.360
If you are old enough to where you don't drop your pants

18:03.360 --> 18:05.200
around your ankles at the urinal,

18:05.200 --> 18:08.240
if you're older than that, I feel like you can't be there.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.160
It's a certain level of awareness, right?

18:10.160 --> 18:12.000
Like, oh, now I'm suddenly aware,

18:12.000 --> 18:13.280
but not comfortable enough.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.840
You know what, that's exactly it, Travis.

18:15.840 --> 18:19.120
But sometimes when a kid does that at the urinal,

18:19.120 --> 18:21.120
I feel like it's a power play.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.480
Oh, it's the biggest power play.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.400
That's where we lost it.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.440
Like the moment I stopped doing that is the moment

18:27.440 --> 18:30.160
I let go of something primal and savage in myself

18:30.160 --> 18:32.560
that connected me to Gaia.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.720
I feel like the moment I stopped dropping trowel completely.

18:36.720 --> 18:37.920
And like, just to pee at the urinal.

18:37.920 --> 18:41.200
Your primal scream to the sky as you pee in the urinal.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.240
And you know what the problem is?

18:42.960 --> 18:43.920
For me, I would do it.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.800
You know me, I don't have anything to hide down there.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.240
Right, and you don't have anything.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.840
I don't have anything in my zone.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.880
It's not even smooth like a Kindle.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.480
It's just negative space.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.800
You look and it's like your eyes drift to the right.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.960
You can't look directly at it.

18:58.960 --> 19:03.760
Chest, belly, you get a little bit of hip bones poking out

19:03.760 --> 19:04.800
and then there's nothing.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.040
Like, I'm like Rayman down there.

19:07.040 --> 19:11.120
Just like my legs connect through some mysterious magic.

19:11.120 --> 19:14.240
Anyway, I would do it, but bathroom floors are so dirty

19:14.240 --> 19:16.000
and I don't want my pants butt to touch that.

19:16.800 --> 19:17.360
True.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.000
If your pants butt gets wet from the floor,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.920
the wetness on the floor, you're done.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.080
You gotta stay in that bathroom forever.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.680
You have to leave those pants there.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.440
The image that I can't get out of my head

19:27.440 --> 19:29.360
because it's incredibly funny to me

19:29.360 --> 19:32.160
is this 13 year old dude rolling up to his friend's house

19:32.160 --> 19:33.600
walking in the door and just like,

19:36.160 --> 19:37.200
finally I'm free.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.720
Been a hard day at the old salt mines.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.480
Doris, you got any cupcakes?

19:42.480 --> 19:44.560
Naked Doris, my friend's naked mom.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.480
Did you make cupcakes for us?

19:46.480 --> 19:48.640
For the last time, Steven, we're not nudists.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.640
You walked in on us having sex once.

19:50.640 --> 19:51.200
One time.

19:52.080 --> 19:52.960
That's cool.

19:52.960 --> 19:53.600
That's cool.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.760
These ants on a log sort of a public thing

19:55.760 --> 19:57.440
or you save these for a private snack?

19:57.440 --> 19:58.480
Get out of our house.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.600
Okay, see you tomorrow.

20:00.640 --> 20:03.760
That's how Matthew McConaughey met me.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.720
This is the best how I spent my summer vacation report

20:10.720 --> 20:12.800
I've ever read, Mr. Macaron.

20:12.800 --> 20:18.880
And in closing, I'm Mark Twain

20:18.880 --> 20:20.640
and that's the last thing I ever wrote.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.960
And now I die.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.080
So please sign up for my Patreon.

20:30.080 --> 20:33.600
This may be a contentious statement,

20:33.600 --> 20:39.120
but I think if your family agrees to go on a journey

20:39.120 --> 20:41.920
with this other family that will involve your whole family,

20:41.920 --> 20:45.760
getting their dicks and their vaginas out,

20:45.760 --> 20:47.440
then they are in fact nudists.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.760
They have crossed the Rubicon, the nudicon.

20:49.760 --> 20:53.920
Yeah, I don't think there is a partial nudist.

20:55.440 --> 20:59.520
I'm gonna dip into it publicly for a weekend at this resort

20:59.520 --> 21:00.800
and just see how I feel.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.440
And I know we're talking, I know it's a complex subject

21:03.440 --> 21:05.840
and I'm sure that we are frustrating a lot of people right now

21:05.840 --> 21:08.400
because you can like be into it for like a week

21:08.400 --> 21:10.800
and then hop out and say like, well, it's just not for us.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.400
There's probably a lot more to that lifestyle

21:12.400 --> 21:14.880
than just like, oh, these people are naked.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.080
Cool, cool, cool.

21:16.080 --> 21:17.840
There's a lot more to it than that, I'm sure.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.200
But like, I don't know, man.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.000
I think about like, that is not something

21:22.000 --> 21:24.720
that I think I would ever do

21:24.720 --> 21:27.680
unless I was like fully into the lifestyle.

21:27.680 --> 21:30.960
I don't know, maybe I should go full 30 days.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.880
Maybe you should be nude at home first

21:32.880 --> 21:34.160
and then invite like one friend over.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.120
I don't even do that.

21:36.160 --> 21:39.120
I can't be nude by myself because the cat's here.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.440
And he'll judge you.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.480
Sometimes when my dog watches me poop,

21:44.480 --> 21:45.840
I know she's judging me.

21:45.840 --> 21:49.120
There is a moment that I wish I could be there

21:49.120 --> 21:52.320
for at nudist camp and that is you drive there

21:52.320 --> 21:55.440
with clothes on and then you park

21:55.440 --> 21:57.440
and you get your key to your room.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.880
When does everyone sort of look at each other

22:00.880 --> 22:05.360
and say like, well, I guess now we should take our clothes off.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.840
Especially if it's your first time and you don't know

22:07.840 --> 22:09.280
and it's like general knowledge

22:09.280 --> 22:12.080
that like you get undressed in your room and come out

22:12.080 --> 22:13.680
and like the front desk isn't cool

22:13.680 --> 22:15.680
with just naked people walking in,

22:15.680 --> 22:17.520
but you don't know that because it's your first time.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.360
So you're sitting in the car doing that awkward,

22:19.360 --> 22:20.880
like we're not gonna get out of the car,

22:20.880 --> 22:22.320
get naked, we're gonna do it here in the seat.

22:22.320 --> 22:25.520
I'm sure there's like a prison processing room

22:25.520 --> 22:26.640
where they take all their clothes.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.440
All their clothes with the lousing powder and everything.

22:29.440 --> 22:35.440
Sydney and I went to a murder mystery weekend last year.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.800
I'm worried about this story.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.240
No, no, no, hanging with me.

22:38.240 --> 22:39.840
We went to a murder mystery weekend last year.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.040
We've been a few times since then.

22:41.040 --> 22:44.080
Scraps went with us one last year.

22:44.080 --> 22:44.800
It was a lot of fun.

22:44.800 --> 22:48.560
But our first time, you go in character,

22:48.560 --> 22:50.720
you have your costume, you have your old backstory.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.480
So we did the first two nights

22:54.480 --> 22:57.280
and then the last day you show up to find out who killed who.

22:58.560 --> 22:59.520
We always solve it.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.600
So there's Rob some of the drama,

23:01.600 --> 23:05.440
but we showed up in costume, in character

23:05.440 --> 23:08.000
and found out once we arrived there

23:08.000 --> 23:10.880
that on Sunday morning, nobody's in costume

23:10.880 --> 23:11.840
or character anymore.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.520
So like all bets are off.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.320
I tell this story as a way of illustrating

23:16.320 --> 23:20.000
that something like that would almost certainly happen

23:20.720 --> 23:21.840
in a nudist camp.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.760
And that's what genuinely terrifies me about it.

23:23.760 --> 23:26.800
There would be some thing where no,

23:26.800 --> 23:28.400
we're never naked for this.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.040
We're not naked for the church service.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.640
This is church.

23:32.640 --> 23:33.760
This is church.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.080
You can't take communion.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you perverts.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.360
You, are you genuinely right now naked

23:41.360 --> 23:43.280
on cinnamon roll Saturday?

23:43.280 --> 23:46.080
You know that's the one time none of us get naked

23:46.080 --> 23:46.560
because it's so sticky.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.560
Did you not read the welcome pamphlet?

23:48.560 --> 23:49.920
It's the one day.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.080
That's the one stickiest day.

23:52.080 --> 23:54.160
One sticky day that we don't get naked

23:54.160 --> 23:55.520
and it's counterintuitive

23:55.520 --> 23:58.640
because otherwise we could just go down to the sex host

23:58.640 --> 24:00.720
and blast off after we get sticky.

24:00.720 --> 24:04.640
Do you think there's a possibility

24:04.640 --> 24:07.760
that this 13 year old boy's family does not know

24:08.640 --> 24:10.480
that they are going to prison camp?

24:10.480 --> 24:11.040
No.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.880
That it's like, hey, mom and dad,

24:12.880 --> 24:16.720
the Stevens invited us to a weekend vacation with them.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.800
Oh, and you're thinking they discover when they get

24:18.800 --> 24:21.440
that you're making kind of a Jim Belushi movie now.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.680
Yeah, it's like, hey, hey son,

24:24.400 --> 24:26.480
why are there so many dicks and balls everywhere?

24:26.480 --> 24:27.520
Where's the balls come from?

24:29.040 --> 24:29.920
Why am balls?

24:29.920 --> 24:33.120
This summer, Brian Cranston falls from grace

24:33.120 --> 24:35.440
in his new movie, OOPS! Red and Nudist Camp.

24:36.160 --> 24:36.720
And I took my whole family-

24:36.720 --> 24:37.840
OOPS! Balls!

24:37.840 --> 24:41.200
Wayne Zelinsky is back in Honey, No One's Wearing Clothes.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.200
Honey, I blew up my-

24:43.920 --> 24:45.040
I blew up my spot.

24:48.480 --> 24:49.760
How about another question?

24:49.760 --> 24:51.760
What if Brian Cranston took over for Rick Moranis

24:51.760 --> 24:53.120
in the role of Wayne Zelinsky in a-

24:53.120 --> 24:54.320
I would watch that so fucking hard.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.920
Of Honey, I Shove the Kids.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.040
The third actor after Peter Scoleri to play the role.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.320
Who did an excellent job.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.760
Doesn't get enough attention for that role.

25:01.760 --> 25:02.160
You know what?

25:02.160 --> 25:03.680
He really captured the Wayne Zelinsky spirit.

25:03.680 --> 25:04.480
Really did great.

25:05.920 --> 25:06.560
Sorry, go ahead.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.080
No, read a question.

25:08.080 --> 25:08.960
You're going ahead.

25:08.960 --> 25:09.600
Oh, I do this.

25:10.400 --> 25:10.900
Okay.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.960
What if this episode becomes everybody's favorite

25:14.960 --> 25:16.640
and I have to keep-

25:17.200 --> 25:18.400
Doing Kyra Kojo?

25:18.400 --> 25:21.200
I have to keep taking opiates.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.480
I don't know if I can get behind that.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.240
Do you want me to read the question, Bubby?

25:24.240 --> 25:26.080
This is our behind the music, isn't it?

25:26.080 --> 25:28.400
So a while ago, I got a large TV to put

25:28.400 --> 25:29.520
in the living room in my apartment

25:29.520 --> 25:31.600
so my roommates and I could enjoy hosting people

25:31.600 --> 25:32.560
for movie nights and such.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.960
One of my roommates is a mechanic

25:34.960 --> 25:36.320
and while fixing an engine,

25:36.320 --> 25:39.200
the living room started to fill up with engine parts.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.160
So because I did not expect to do much hosting

25:42.160 --> 25:43.520
while the living room was a mess,

25:43.520 --> 25:45.280
I moved the TV up to my room.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.080
Now the engine is fixed, the living room is clear,

25:48.080 --> 25:51.120
but I've gotten used to having a big TV in my room.

25:51.120 --> 25:52.400
Yeah, it's nice.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.520
Yeah, it's right.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.000
Should I give up having such a nice luxury item

25:56.000 --> 25:57.600
in my bedroom and return the TV

25:57.600 --> 26:00.800
to the public area or should I revel in my greed

26:00.800 --> 26:02.080
and hoard it up for myself?

26:02.080 --> 26:04.880
And that's from TV hoarder on the Illinois border

26:04.880 --> 26:07.360
who judging from his name has already made his choice.

26:10.720 --> 26:13.200
What are the other people in the house even do now?

26:14.480 --> 26:18.000
Do they just like draw a picture of a TV on the wall

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
and they just like stare at it and sigh?

26:20.000 --> 26:20.560
They paint.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.680
They have conversations with each other

26:23.680 --> 26:24.960
and read fine novels.

26:25.840 --> 26:26.080
No.

26:26.080 --> 26:28.720
No, they really embrace life to its fullest

26:28.720 --> 26:31.840
and they don't engage in distraction behavior

26:32.640 --> 26:34.400
or they sit quietly and hate you

26:34.400 --> 26:37.360
for taking away the TV box every time they look at you.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.040
He's the one with the glowy screen.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.920
I mean, I would do it just because like,

26:44.720 --> 26:48.160
I mean, I get in pretty unhealthy patterns

26:48.160 --> 26:53.680
of watching TV for a day, like all of it,

26:53.680 --> 26:56.240
like from the moment I wake until the moment I reach

26:56.240 --> 26:57.520
my sweet slumbers.

26:57.520 --> 26:58.160
Oh my God.

26:59.520 --> 27:02.800
We discovered that there's a surprise,

27:02.800 --> 27:03.680
you know, I did not know this,

27:03.680 --> 27:05.760
but there's a surprising amount of TV on YouTube.

27:06.800 --> 27:07.280
Oh yeah.

27:07.280 --> 27:10.080
And you can look up like, especially international stuff.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.480
Sydney and I accidentally discovered

27:12.480 --> 27:15.520
that all of the Canadian version of Shark Tank,

27:15.520 --> 27:16.720
which is called Dragon's Den,

27:16.720 --> 27:19.200
as it is most of the world is on YouTube.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.360
Except for America where we do not fear dragons.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.320
We don't fear dragons.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.080
We conquer them.

27:24.080 --> 27:25.600
We conquer the dragons.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.720
So now we have shocks.

27:26.720 --> 27:28.560
But yeah, there's like eight seasons

27:28.560 --> 27:30.960
of Dragon's Den on YouTube.

27:30.960 --> 27:34.560
And apparently there's a lot more where that came from.

27:34.560 --> 27:38.720
So that has been a problematic situation for us

27:38.720 --> 27:41.680
knowing that there's fresh, fresh Dragon's Den.

27:41.680 --> 27:41.840
Right.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.440
I wanna address a bigger problem here,

27:43.440 --> 27:46.000
which is why the fuck did your roommate bring engine parts

27:46.000 --> 27:47.280
in your goddamn living room?

27:47.280 --> 27:48.320
Yeah, it's where you live.

27:48.320 --> 27:49.680
It's not where you engine.

27:49.680 --> 27:53.120
You wouldn't say like my roommate is a veterinarian,

27:53.120 --> 27:54.960
so he's neutering cats here.

27:54.960 --> 27:58.560
No, he's expressing anal glands in the kitchen.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.960
Tell him to keep that shit outside where engines blow.

28:00.960 --> 28:01.920
Where they go.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.440
It's outside exclusively.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.760
And then you would never take the TV box away.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.200
What I was saying before is like,

28:07.200 --> 28:08.880
I'll watch TV in an unhealthy way,

28:08.880 --> 28:10.720
but as long as I'm doing it with my wife,

28:11.440 --> 28:15.840
then it's an activity and not a vice.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.040
Well, there's also something like,

28:17.040 --> 28:19.440
until I moved in with Teresa,

28:19.440 --> 28:22.000
I always had a TV in my bedroom,

28:22.000 --> 28:23.360
and she is not a fan of that.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.280
At first, that was really off-putting to me,

28:25.840 --> 28:28.640
but now it's kind of nice because for the times,

28:28.640 --> 28:30.640
like when we get sick or one of us is ill

28:30.640 --> 28:32.560
and we move the TV into the bedroom,

28:32.560 --> 28:34.800
it really does become an anchor.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.600
Oh, yeah.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.240
Keeps you in bed or brings you to bed early

28:38.240 --> 28:39.840
and you don't really do a lot of shit.

28:39.840 --> 28:42.560
At least in the living room, you do more stuff.

28:42.560 --> 28:45.120
Like I can work on the computer while the TV's on,

28:45.120 --> 28:47.840
or I feel like at least I'm sitting up or walking around.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.040
What about the terrifying-

28:49.040 --> 28:52.240
What if the darkness creeps up on you

28:52.240 --> 28:53.280
while you're in your bedroom

28:53.280 --> 28:54.480
and you're trying to get dressed?

28:54.480 --> 28:55.280
What do you do then?

28:56.400 --> 28:57.840
I sing a little song to myself

28:57.840 --> 28:59.360
about how lucky I am to be alive.

29:00.240 --> 29:01.040
How's that go?

29:01.040 --> 29:01.840
How's that song go?

29:02.960 --> 29:05.200
Thank God I'm not dead

29:06.320 --> 29:09.280
because the world would be empty without me.

29:09.280 --> 29:09.600
Okay.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.560
It usually kind of then devolves from there

29:12.560 --> 29:13.360
into how awesome I am.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.720
About how great you are, yeah, sure.

29:15.280 --> 29:16.800
Boy, I think we're all pretty lucky.

29:16.800 --> 29:17.920
Trios is still kicking.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.160
I just assume everyone sings a song like that.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.400
Thank you, God, for Travis.

29:23.440 --> 29:24.640
Where would I be without-

29:24.640 --> 29:27.600
He's the sun in the sky and the stars at night

29:27.600 --> 29:30.560
who guides me home on the choppy seas.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.080
Thank Jesus for Travis.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.200
Travis is Jesus.

29:33.200 --> 29:36.480
And then it just kind of keeps going.

29:36.480 --> 29:39.680
Thank Travis for Travis, his all-seeing power.

29:42.160 --> 29:44.320
Thank Travis for Travis.

29:44.320 --> 29:50.320
People don't write enough hymns about themselves, you know?

29:51.840 --> 29:54.880
Oh, but up to the first stanza of hymn 341.

29:54.880 --> 29:58.320
Thank Travis for Travis and Travis is Travis.

29:58.320 --> 30:01.200
Our hearts are all Travis and brains are Travis too.

30:01.840 --> 30:02.880
Third stanza.

30:04.240 --> 30:04.960
Oh, man.

30:04.960 --> 30:08.640
I need some thank Travis for Travis propaganda posters.

30:08.640 --> 30:15.600
You know, Travis, I feel like there's been this narrative

30:16.160 --> 30:18.560
among some of our listenership that you don't get the respect

30:18.560 --> 30:20.480
that you deserve on this show.

30:20.480 --> 30:23.680
So I'm all about, I don't know, canonizing you.

30:24.720 --> 30:27.200
I also want to point out one of the reasons that happens is

30:27.200 --> 30:28.160
I don't really need it.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.280
I take care of that on my own.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.160
The other thing is that a little bit of that on Travis

30:34.160 --> 30:35.920
goes quite a long way.

30:35.920 --> 30:40.560
So visit travismacaroy.com for all your Travis Macaroy needs.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.760
Let's go to the Money Zone.

30:41.760 --> 30:42.240
Yeah, yeah.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.440
Is it Money Zone time already?

30:44.240 --> 30:45.280
You've had so much fun.

30:55.440 --> 30:58.320
Boys, I want to tell you about your face.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.000
Please do.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.440
You're not boys anymore.

31:01.440 --> 31:02.800
You're not old children.

31:02.800 --> 31:03.280
You're men.

31:03.280 --> 31:06.800
And as men, you need to start taking care of the gift

31:06.800 --> 31:10.000
that God gave you, your visage and your your shavables.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.920
We're going to help you out with that by telling you

31:13.920 --> 31:15.840
about harrys.com.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.560
Now, I also want to make I want to make one more thing clear

31:18.560 --> 31:19.840
before we move on, Justin.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.640
Men are not the only human beings that shave.

31:22.640 --> 31:25.040
Yeah, women also have shavables.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.960
I know they shave their shavables.

31:26.960 --> 31:28.080
You didn't even let me finish.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.400
I was talking to you first and then I was going to branch out

31:30.400 --> 31:31.040
from there.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.320
How come the men got to go first?

31:32.320 --> 31:33.520
How come the men got to go first?

31:33.520 --> 31:35.040
Because I was talking to you.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.520
Just talk about us as mammals with hair on our bodies.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.800
I have two brothers.

31:38.800 --> 31:39.920
I don't have any sisters.

31:39.920 --> 31:41.440
You have two humans.

31:41.440 --> 31:45.600
To my siblings who can shave whatever the hell they want to,

31:46.160 --> 31:47.680
I want to tell you about harrys.com.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.840
I've been waiting for permission from you for so long

31:50.880 --> 31:51.840
to get my toes did.

31:53.680 --> 31:54.800
Buying razors sucks.

31:55.520 --> 31:56.880
Razors are really expensive.

31:57.520 --> 31:58.640
They keep them behind glass.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.240
They treat you like a criminal.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.360
If you buy them, you have to come over and they'll unlock them

32:03.360 --> 32:03.760
for you.

32:03.760 --> 32:07.440
They're in a clamshell and they cost $100,000 and they're the

32:07.440 --> 32:07.840
worst.

32:07.840 --> 32:08.960
Why do they protect?

32:08.960 --> 32:11.760
Like that's yeah, there are other things in this Walgreens

32:11.760 --> 32:13.760
that could kill people with way, way, way easier.

32:13.760 --> 32:14.640
Is that it?

32:14.640 --> 32:15.280
But you know why?

32:15.280 --> 32:17.200
Because they're so expensive.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.320
Like $45.

32:18.320 --> 32:21.120
But Harry's is going to give you a better shape of experience

32:21.120 --> 32:23.120
for a fraction of the price.

32:23.120 --> 32:25.840
They got these great German engineered blades.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.840
They sent us some and they were great.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.400
I had a great shave with them.

32:32.400 --> 32:36.800
It actually, no kidding, got me off of I had been using safety

32:36.800 --> 32:37.440
razors.

32:37.440 --> 32:38.640
I've been doing wet shaving.

32:38.640 --> 32:42.320
It actually got me off of that because I was enjoying the

32:42.320 --> 32:43.600
Harry's experience so much.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.800
And not only did they give you a great shape, they look really

32:46.800 --> 32:47.280
classy.

32:47.280 --> 32:47.760
Yeah, they do.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.360
They have some really good looking blades.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.840
And it's the kind of thing where anybody like who's in your

32:51.840 --> 32:54.000
bathroom, snooping through your stuff and finds out it's going

32:54.000 --> 32:56.080
to be like, oh, I bet this is a really expensive razor.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.400
Then they'll probably steal it because you have shitty friends.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.000
But it looks really nice.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.960
And doesn't it all look like the cheap razors you buy at the

33:02.960 --> 33:04.800
store that cost you $45 for a package?

33:04.800 --> 33:05.600
Nicely weighted.

33:06.320 --> 33:10.000
For $15, you're going to get a box that includes a handle,

33:10.720 --> 33:13.920
three blades, and shave cream shipped to your door.

33:13.920 --> 33:18.720
That is less than like a refill of just safety blades.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.640
And one of the co-founders is the guy that started Warby

33:22.640 --> 33:23.360
Parker.

33:23.360 --> 33:23.840
Oh, shit.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.280
That dude's taking over.

33:25.280 --> 33:25.680
Yeah.

33:25.680 --> 33:26.560
So he's blowing up.

33:26.560 --> 33:27.360
He's a rich guy.

33:27.360 --> 33:29.920
Go give him more of your money by ordering online.

33:29.920 --> 33:30.480
It's super easy.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.960
Just go to harrys.com and you're going to use the promo

33:32.960 --> 33:35.120
code, my brother, all one word.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.680
And they're going to give you $5 off your first purchase.

33:39.680 --> 33:42.080
So that's a crazy deal.

33:42.080 --> 33:43.040
That's $10.

33:43.040 --> 33:46.000
So for that basic kit.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.960
So I'm still using the shaving cream, by the way.

33:48.960 --> 33:49.680
It's great.

33:49.680 --> 33:50.720
Very luxurious.

33:52.880 --> 33:55.120
I mean, I'm using the other stuff too, but I'm still on

33:55.120 --> 33:56.720
that initial tube of shaving cream.

33:56.720 --> 33:57.600
It lasts quite a while.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.400
Does it have a scent?

33:59.840 --> 34:00.960
Not overpowering.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.560
It's just sort of a general.

34:02.560 --> 34:03.280
Just clean.

34:03.280 --> 34:04.400
I would say unisex.

34:04.400 --> 34:05.600
I would say a man or woman could use it.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.160
Fresh.

34:06.160 --> 34:06.720
Freshness.

34:06.720 --> 34:10.480
And I'm a bearded gentleman, but I still use it on my neck

34:10.480 --> 34:11.280
and the back of my neck.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.800
And my wife used the razor as well, and she's a big fan.

34:14.800 --> 34:15.600
So go check it out.

34:16.240 --> 34:19.760
If you're looking for a new, affordable, classy shaving

34:19.760 --> 34:21.680
experience, go to harrys.com.

34:21.680 --> 34:24.160
And use the coupon code, my brother.

34:24.160 --> 34:28.240
As long as you're upgrading your life, why not upgrade your

34:28.240 --> 34:29.280
finances too?

34:29.280 --> 34:30.400
Go to simple.com.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.840
It's the way banking should be.

34:31.840 --> 34:34.400
They're rebuilding banking from the ground up.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.160
There's no minimum balance.

34:36.160 --> 34:37.600
There's no monthly fee.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.440
There's no overdraft charge.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
And there are 55,000 fee-free ATMs.

34:44.640 --> 34:46.000
And they have photo check deposit.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.120
I'm a simple customer.

34:47.120 --> 34:47.920
I signed up.

34:47.920 --> 34:52.560
It is really, really an easy way to manage.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.280
Like, just this week, I didn't have to go to the bank because

34:55.280 --> 34:57.760
I took pictures of my checks.

34:57.760 --> 35:01.120
And then once the checks were, like, deposited, I actually got

35:01.120 --> 35:03.760
a push notification telling me that they were in there.

35:03.760 --> 35:06.480
Can I ask you a question real quick?

35:08.240 --> 35:10.160
Without the minimum balance and the monthly fees and the

35:10.160 --> 35:15.600
overdraft charges and the ATM charges, how do they fuck me?

35:16.640 --> 35:18.240
Hey, here's the crazy thing about it.

35:18.240 --> 35:19.440
They don't fuck you.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.480
How about that?

35:20.480 --> 35:20.960
Huh?

35:20.960 --> 35:23.360
That's yeah, but like, how do they operate?

35:23.360 --> 35:26.400
Cause it's like, if you give me an option on like, on the app

35:26.400 --> 35:28.160
that you can select, fuck me.

35:28.160 --> 35:28.800
Yeah.

35:28.800 --> 35:31.200
Cause like, if you give me $5, right.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.280
And then you say, yo G man, need that $5 back.

35:33.280 --> 35:36.720
And I just give you $5 back.

35:36.720 --> 35:39.120
I didn't get anything.

35:39.120 --> 35:39.680
Right.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.800
So they, it's complicated, but interest is involved.

35:42.800 --> 35:43.360
I bet.

35:43.360 --> 35:44.000
I don't know.

35:44.000 --> 35:44.880
It's a real bank though.

35:44.880 --> 35:48.240
They're FDIC insured and they don't sell your data and stuff.

35:48.240 --> 35:49.040
I would almost trust.

35:49.040 --> 35:52.160
It's weird that I am having a hard time trusting it because

35:52.160 --> 35:55.360
they don't want to fuck me every day, every moment of my life

35:55.360 --> 35:57.200
for like half the shit that I have.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.520
The, uh, the other cool thing about it is if you have

35:59.520 --> 36:03.440
spending goals, Sydney and I are saving up for a down payment

36:03.440 --> 36:06.720
on a house and we tell simple how much we want to save and

36:06.720 --> 36:07.600
where we want to get to.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.160
And it'll actually automatically save that much and tell us how

36:10.160 --> 36:12.400
much we can spend to stay on track.

36:12.400 --> 36:15.760
So it's a bank that's like not actively trying to fuck you,

36:15.760 --> 36:18.320
which is heartbreakingly revolutionary.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.560
And that was the original tagline, but they couldn't get

36:20.560 --> 36:23.120
past the sensors and also Obama.

36:23.120 --> 36:25.120
So simple.com slash my brother.

36:25.680 --> 36:29.040
You can, uh, uh, fix your shit.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.080
I got a message.

36:30.080 --> 36:35.040
Uh, I don't make me say it for big daddy Hoffman.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.640
What was that accent?

36:36.640 --> 36:37.840
For big daddy.

36:37.840 --> 36:38.640
Okay.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.800
Big daddy's got to get his piece of the pie.

36:40.800 --> 36:41.440
Okay.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.040
Elizabeth Taylor and kind of hot.

36:43.040 --> 36:43.360
Yeah.

36:43.360 --> 36:46.400
Kind of, uh, we got to celebrate big daddy.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.400
Hoffman is from Eric.

36:48.400 --> 36:49.120
Can you do anything?

36:49.120 --> 36:49.680
Eric.

36:49.680 --> 36:49.920
Okay.

36:52.480 --> 36:56.320
Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric says he needs to get his piece of the

36:56.320 --> 36:59.920
pie to smaller piece for a smaller name.

36:59.920 --> 37:03.520
Um, Eric says to big daddy Hoffman.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.800
Happy birthday, big guy.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.520
Although you're just one malpractice suit away from

37:07.520 --> 37:09.760
losing your license and you probably should have become a

37:09.760 --> 37:11.360
cobbler or a dog cobbler.

37:11.360 --> 37:14.480
Instead, people and dogs love shoes.

37:14.480 --> 37:18.400
It says in this message, it feels like this guy is trying

37:18.400 --> 37:22.640
to push his like his agenda on his cobbling agenda.

37:22.640 --> 37:23.120
Yeah.

37:23.120 --> 37:24.960
For dogs, dog cobbler.

37:24.960 --> 37:28.160
Um, it's been great having a doctor friend to buy drugs from

37:28.160 --> 37:30.240
is dog cobbling a viable career choice.

37:30.240 --> 37:34.080
What I really mean to say is I miss my dad and then it gets

37:34.080 --> 37:34.640
cut off here.

37:34.640 --> 37:35.440
What it says.

37:35.440 --> 37:36.320
100 years.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.600
You ran out of characters.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.200
100 years choices.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.840
Happy birthday, big daddy Hoffman.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.160
Um, listen, big daddy Hoffman.

37:48.160 --> 37:49.040
We're very proud of you.

37:49.840 --> 37:54.800
Uh, please don't sell drugs to your friends who will then brag

37:54.800 --> 37:59.040
about it on, uh, on this radio.

37:59.040 --> 38:02.480
Something big daddy would do now to get a little bit of

38:02.480 --> 38:05.120
something on the side joke that Eric is making.

38:05.120 --> 38:08.160
Yeah, you're gonna have a you're gonna have a sore throat.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.800
Travy, if you keep that up, no, it actually is loosening up a

38:10.800 --> 38:11.760
lot of the flim in there.

38:11.760 --> 38:12.240
Gross.

38:12.240 --> 38:12.960
I have another message.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.880
Oh, happy birthday, big daddy Hoffman.

38:14.880 --> 38:18.400
Um, your friend, Eric, sounds like he might not be the best

38:18.400 --> 38:19.200
influence on you.

38:19.920 --> 38:20.960
Real choice friend there.

38:20.960 --> 38:23.680
Got another message for Ruth from Brent.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.360
You want to do anything fun with that traveling like a

38:25.360 --> 38:27.040
different Ruth friend.

38:27.040 --> 38:27.600
Okay.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.960
I said it with a smile.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.480
Can you hear the difference here?

38:30.480 --> 38:31.120
Okay.

38:31.120 --> 38:31.600
Ruth.

38:31.600 --> 38:32.160
That's a frown.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.440
This is with a smile.

38:33.440 --> 38:33.920
Ruth.

38:33.920 --> 38:34.400
Yeah.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.320
It can start the intonation changes.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.880
Can you do it with like a like a really sad frown?

38:39.600 --> 38:40.240
Ruth.

38:40.240 --> 38:40.480
Yeah.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.720
I'm Ruth.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.080
That's how you sound, Ruth.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.360
Happy birthday, Ruth.

38:45.360 --> 38:46.720
Why do you sound so sad all the time?

38:47.440 --> 38:50.560
Hope you have an excellent year in which you discover how Babby

38:50.560 --> 38:51.280
is formed.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.200
Maybe you'll also have adventures in which you learn

38:53.200 --> 38:56.480
exciting things like the fact that dolphins are not mammals

38:56.480 --> 38:58.400
and the dark truth about Canada.

38:58.400 --> 39:01.600
I better stop before the brothers segue to horses, ghosts

39:01.600 --> 39:02.640
or ghost horses.

39:02.640 --> 39:03.680
Much love, Brent.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.120
You know, we haven't talked about in a while.

39:05.760 --> 39:06.240
Dolphin.

39:06.240 --> 39:06.800
Dolphins.

39:06.800 --> 39:07.280
Dolphins.

39:08.720 --> 39:09.840
What's up with those things?

39:09.840 --> 39:11.040
It's pronounced do fan.

39:11.040 --> 39:11.840
Are they do fan?

39:11.840 --> 39:12.560
Are they fish?

39:13.520 --> 39:14.000
The horse.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.320
There is a fish called the dolphin and is delicious.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.600
That's confusing, right?

39:17.600 --> 39:20.240
I remember being a little kid and they had dolphin and I was

39:20.240 --> 39:20.720
eating it.

39:20.720 --> 39:24.000
I had this really like smug, shitty eating grin on my face.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.160
Like, take this, you adorable bitches.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.640
And then someone told me it was a fish and not the mammal.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.400
Why would they name two things dolphin?

39:31.120 --> 39:32.800
Ruth, we're very happy for you.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.320
Sounds like you got a big ear out of you.

39:34.320 --> 39:37.760
Yeah, it also kind of sounds like you're 12.

39:38.560 --> 39:38.800
Why?

39:39.760 --> 39:42.640
Well, cause she's going to learn how, how Babies are made

39:42.640 --> 39:44.240
and she's probably about dolphins.

39:44.240 --> 39:45.120
She's pregnant.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.000
Oh, okay.

39:46.000 --> 39:46.400
Yeah.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.080
Oh, she's fucking dullard.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.520
I don't think she's about to go into sixth grade where they

39:51.520 --> 39:53.680
have like sex ed and also dolphins.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.240
And Canada class.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.280
You learn your times tables.

39:57.280 --> 40:00.480
You go to Canada class and then you learn how sex works.

40:00.480 --> 40:02.240
I don't think that's true, Travis.

40:02.240 --> 40:06.880
I think when you've been to that new club sex works, hi,

40:06.880 --> 40:08.080
my name is Ruchika Sherway.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.400
And I have a podcast called song explorer.

40:10.400 --> 40:13.040
In each episode, a musician takes apart one of their songs

40:13.040 --> 40:15.840
and piece by piece tells you the story of how it was made.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.480
You get an inside look into the creative and technical process

40:18.480 --> 40:20.720
and a unique view of a song by hearing just the drums

40:22.720 --> 40:26.480
or just the guitars or say just a world.

40:26.480 --> 40:27.120
It's a piano.

40:27.120 --> 40:33.840
If you're a fan of music, if you make music, or if you just like to learn how things are made,

40:33.840 --> 40:36.000
come check it out on maximum fun.org.

40:36.000 --> 40:36.320
Thanks.

40:38.960 --> 40:39.680
Y'all want to Yahoo?

40:40.400 --> 40:41.600
Yeah, I guess I do.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.040
I guess I always did.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.640
This Yahoo was sent in by John.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.240
Then I had a lot of growing up to do.

40:46.240 --> 40:46.480
Yeah.

40:46.480 --> 40:48.000
But the magic was in you all along.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.040
It wasn't in the question.

40:49.920 --> 40:52.160
That's been the Wonder Years series finale.

40:52.720 --> 40:53.040
Thank you.

40:53.040 --> 40:53.600
Good night.

40:53.600 --> 40:57.040
Sent in by John Severs or Severs.

40:57.040 --> 41:01.200
What if at the end of the Wonder Years, the camera panned back

41:01.200 --> 41:05.520
and it revealed that it was not an older version of Kevin,

41:05.520 --> 41:09.360
but rather an older man that had been following him around for six years.

41:10.080 --> 41:13.120
The camera just pulled back one like just six inches

41:13.120 --> 41:18.560
to show Daniel Stern there looming by the entire time.

41:18.560 --> 41:21.440
And then the last shot is just him stabbing him.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.680
The end, the end of the show.

41:23.680 --> 41:26.560
And you've been talking behind this kid's back for six years.

41:28.080 --> 41:28.640
Good show.

41:29.600 --> 41:32.640
Those, yeah, wonderful, wonderful years.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.320
Did you guys watch Wonderful Years?

41:34.320 --> 41:36.400
John Severs or Severs sent this in.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.200
Thank you, John.

41:37.200 --> 41:41.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Todd Blown, who asks,

41:43.040 --> 41:47.600
why does Domino's need to do a quality check on their pizza?

41:47.600 --> 41:54.640
I ordered a pizza from Domino's online and they gave me an up to the minute report

41:54.640 --> 41:56.000
of what they were doing.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.960
Order placed, prep, bake, quality check, and delivery.

42:00.960 --> 42:05.200
Well, it's kind of nice to get immediate feedback of just where my order is in the process,

42:05.200 --> 42:08.320
but I wonder, what is the quality check stage?

42:08.880 --> 42:10.960
After they bake it and before they deliver,

42:10.960 --> 42:16.080
do they really do a quality check on the pizza?

42:16.080 --> 42:18.160
This is actually a really good question.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.360
It's an amazing question.

42:19.360 --> 42:21.280
It's a really fantastic question.

42:21.280 --> 42:23.200
What I love about this is that Tony's saying like,

42:23.200 --> 42:25.920
let's be honest, guys, I'm just going to shove it in my face.

42:25.920 --> 42:26.880
Well, no, it's not just that.

42:26.880 --> 42:28.640
It's like, I've never worked in a pizza place.

42:28.640 --> 42:31.520
It might only like, I guess I worked concessions at a theater.

42:31.520 --> 42:32.240
It doesn't really count.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.840
I did work at a yogurt place.

42:33.840 --> 42:35.520
I mean, frozen yogurt.

42:35.520 --> 42:40.480
And it was, I became like a fucking cog in the machine.

42:40.480 --> 42:43.200
If somebody would be like, I want vanilla with the sprinkle, dinkle, tink, tink.

42:43.200 --> 42:46.480
And then I would like put all that shit on it without thinking.

42:46.480 --> 42:48.480
And then it would be the same every fucking time.

42:48.480 --> 42:52.240
How much variation is there on these Domino pizzas,

42:52.240 --> 42:55.280
which I imagine is an even like more mindless process.

42:55.280 --> 42:58.400
Like it is just a assembly line that like,

42:58.400 --> 43:00.880
you need somebody to like scope out each pizza and be like,

43:00.880 --> 43:03.840
oh, you forgot to put sauce on this one.

43:03.840 --> 43:05.440
How the fuck did you forget to do that?

43:05.440 --> 43:06.160
Quality check.

43:06.160 --> 43:07.920
This pizza is upside down.

43:07.920 --> 43:08.800
That's not going to fly.

43:08.800 --> 43:12.160
Much more likely is they have to have something on the pizza tracker

43:12.160 --> 43:15.760
and they don't want to have like arguing over who's going to drive it to you.

43:16.320 --> 43:17.680
Jim takes a smoke break.

43:17.680 --> 43:20.320
Yeah, we put the thing on the little conveyor belt

43:20.320 --> 43:22.240
and we go smoke of the fattest blunt.

43:22.240 --> 43:24.000
And we are going to drive to your house.

43:24.000 --> 43:24.480
There was-

43:24.480 --> 43:27.680
Jim scratches himself and then debates whether to wash hands.

43:29.120 --> 43:33.680
Jim sneaks off to the break room to study for his GED

43:33.680 --> 43:35.680
because he's finally busting out of this joint

43:35.680 --> 43:38.400
and he's going to make something of himself and start a new life.

43:38.400 --> 43:39.680
There's no room for that.

43:39.680 --> 43:40.560
I'm just hungry.

43:40.560 --> 43:43.920
I, on the pizza track, speaking of, speaking of which,

43:43.920 --> 43:45.520
on the pizza tracker at Domino's,

43:45.520 --> 43:48.080
it not only says what activity is being performed on your za-

43:48.080 --> 43:49.440
It says who does it.

43:49.440 --> 43:50.400
It says who does it.

43:50.400 --> 43:56.160
And we got into, when we were, when that first started,

43:56.160 --> 43:58.400
we noticed when like we would have friends over

43:58.400 --> 44:01.120
and we'd order some Domino's,

44:01.120 --> 44:05.360
that it was always a guy named Daniel that made the pizzas.

44:05.360 --> 44:06.480
Oh, pizza Daniel.

44:06.480 --> 44:08.320
Pizza Daniel, as we referred to him.

44:08.320 --> 44:11.280
Yeah, so pizza Daniel, I had some friends.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.360
This was like literally mid-

44:14.080 --> 44:16.160
Whenever Domino's decided to stop sucking.

44:16.160 --> 44:17.440
So like four or five years ago,

44:18.400 --> 44:22.480
we ordered Domino's last weekend

44:23.600 --> 44:25.680
and who should be preparing the pie?

44:25.680 --> 44:27.360
But pizza Daniel.

44:27.360 --> 44:30.480
Daniel, if you're listening, you're doing a great job.

44:31.040 --> 44:35.200
I just need you to like advance in the org.

44:35.200 --> 44:35.760
I feel like-

44:35.760 --> 44:40.720
No, hold on, what if this is like an undercover boss thing

44:40.720 --> 44:43.520
where Daniel now owns, his last name is Domino,

44:43.520 --> 44:45.440
like Daniel Domino, but he still comes back

44:45.440 --> 44:46.560
because he cares about you

44:46.560 --> 44:49.040
because you gave him his start in the pizza industry

44:49.040 --> 44:50.800
and he's like, did Justin order a pizza?

44:50.800 --> 44:51.280
I got this.

44:51.280 --> 44:52.320
I got this one.

44:52.320 --> 44:54.960
Listen, I'm gonna see, I make bank,

44:54.960 --> 44:59.200
but if my boy J-Man needs him a slice, I will do-

44:59.200 --> 45:00.160
I know how he like it.

45:00.880 --> 45:02.880
That's probably not how it actually happened.

45:02.880 --> 45:05.360
He do know how I like it, to be fair.

45:05.360 --> 45:06.800
Daniel do know how he like it.

45:06.800 --> 45:10.400
I think he's stuck underneath that crust ceiling

45:10.400 --> 45:12.640
and I think he needs to bust through it.

45:12.640 --> 45:15.360
I think you're being an enabler, Justin.

45:15.360 --> 45:16.560
Although I do love like,

45:16.560 --> 45:18.080
I remember every time I would come over

45:18.080 --> 45:20.160
and we would order Domino's at your place

45:21.040 --> 45:22.080
and we were usually doing something else

45:22.080 --> 45:23.760
like playing board games or something like that.

45:23.760 --> 45:27.200
You would load up that pizza tracker screen

45:27.200 --> 45:29.440
and you would turn it towards to face all of us

45:29.440 --> 45:31.040
like it was the fucking scoreboard

45:31.040 --> 45:32.480
at a fucking football game.

45:32.480 --> 45:35.200
Or like a countdown for a nuclear launch.

45:35.200 --> 45:38.560
Yeah, and we would get like really nervous.

45:38.560 --> 45:42.240
Like it's been in quality check for like five minutes.

45:42.240 --> 45:44.160
What could the fucking possible issue be?

45:44.160 --> 45:45.680
You know, it's funny, it's funny.

45:45.680 --> 45:47.600
You always see them in quality check.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.840
You never see one get bumped back though.

45:50.560 --> 45:53.200
They don't update, start it over.

45:53.200 --> 45:55.040
Start it over, it was not good.

45:55.600 --> 45:58.320
Had odd number of pepperonis, would not pass.

45:58.320 --> 45:59.280
Was bad pizza.

45:59.280 --> 46:00.160
Trying new.

46:00.160 --> 46:02.800
There's a secret spot on the tracker line

46:02.800 --> 46:04.080
right behind quality check

46:04.080 --> 46:05.440
that just says trying harder.

46:06.720 --> 46:09.680
Look deep within ourself and realize wasn't our best.

46:09.680 --> 46:11.280
Sometimes they'll go back to quality check

46:11.280 --> 46:12.640
and then get bumped back again.

46:12.640 --> 46:14.720
And it's like, we are just not on our game today.

46:14.720 --> 46:15.840
Please forgive.

46:15.840 --> 46:16.800
Somebody grilled it.

46:16.800 --> 46:18.800
Where the fuck did they even find a grill?

46:21.040 --> 46:22.480
Forgot to bake it.

46:22.480 --> 46:23.200
Forgot to bake.

46:23.760 --> 46:24.800
Forgot to bake.

46:24.800 --> 46:26.240
Made pizza soup.

46:26.240 --> 46:27.360
Mildly poisoned.

46:27.360 --> 46:31.200
I'm 25 and I have a small tight group of friends.

46:31.200 --> 46:35.760
You're the worst, you're the worst man.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.120
And my sister.

46:37.120 --> 46:39.040
I used to say when I get married,

46:39.040 --> 46:41.520
my best friend from high school would be my maid of honor,

46:41.520 --> 46:43.520
but lately we haven't been best friends.

46:44.160 --> 46:46.640
She now only calls my sister to hang out

46:46.640 --> 46:48.640
and I only see her if we're all together.

46:48.640 --> 46:51.440
I also am becoming closer with other friends.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.440
I'm getting married and I don't know

46:53.440 --> 46:55.520
if she still expects to be my maid of honor,

46:55.520 --> 46:57.120
but I no longer want her to be.

46:57.840 --> 46:59.920
Should I talk to her about this

46:59.920 --> 47:01.200
or just make the decision?

47:01.200 --> 47:02.080
Thanks so much.

47:02.080 --> 47:04.400
I'm a new listener and I've got a lot of episodes

47:04.400 --> 47:06.080
to catch up on, but I love the show.

47:06.080 --> 47:09.040
That's from Fighting Friends in Philly.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.840
There is easy, easy answer for this.

47:12.800 --> 47:14.240
Okay, I'll see if we agree

47:14.240 --> 47:17.120
because you've been through this more recently.

47:17.120 --> 47:18.000
What do you think?

47:18.000 --> 47:20.080
Okay, Justin, write your answer down on a piece of paper.

47:20.080 --> 47:21.920
Well, no, it's not something I personally went through

47:21.920 --> 47:24.000
because I don't think there was any question

47:24.000 --> 47:25.040
for who it would be.

47:25.040 --> 47:27.280
We had that triangle solution figured out

47:27.280 --> 47:28.160
pretty far in advance.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.920
And it took a lot of the legwork out of it.

47:29.920 --> 47:33.920
But there is some similar level to this

47:33.920 --> 47:35.200
in terms of who you invite,

47:35.200 --> 47:36.960
who you include in your bridal party.

47:36.960 --> 47:38.640
And I will say this, if you have a friend

47:38.640 --> 47:41.040
who you are no longer super, super close with,

47:41.680 --> 47:44.640
that friend is probably also cognizant of that distance.

47:44.640 --> 47:47.040
And if you ask them to be your maid of honor,

47:47.040 --> 47:48.960
it is going to put them in a genuinely

47:48.960 --> 47:51.120
super, super weird position.

47:51.120 --> 47:51.600
You know what I mean?

47:51.600 --> 47:54.480
Where you say, we don't talk anymore,

47:54.480 --> 47:55.840
but I want you to be my maid of honor

47:55.840 --> 47:59.600
because of some arbitrary pact we made when we were 15.

48:00.160 --> 48:02.080
That's going to make them feel very uncomfortable.

48:02.080 --> 48:02.800
That's the thing.

48:04.960 --> 48:08.400
Sometimes you're kind of putting the cart before the horse

48:08.400 --> 48:10.720
because this should be one of those moments

48:10.720 --> 48:13.760
where it's not an opportunity for you

48:13.760 --> 48:15.120
to rekindle a friendship.

48:15.120 --> 48:17.600
It should reflect where you're at in your life

48:17.600 --> 48:19.920
and who you would want in that position.

48:19.920 --> 48:23.600
So it should be exactly who you want.

48:23.600 --> 48:27.440
The fact that you are not choosing her

48:27.440 --> 48:30.400
is a statement on where your relationship is at,

48:30.400 --> 48:32.720
but now is not the time to try to repair it.

48:32.720 --> 48:35.760
You should put who you'd feel most comfortable with there.

48:35.760 --> 48:38.960
I mean, that's the honest reflection of your relationship.

48:38.960 --> 48:42.240
I really feel like there's a statute of limitations

48:43.040 --> 48:45.680
on that kind of discussion and promise.

48:47.760 --> 48:52.000
Kids who pretended marriages when they were eight

48:52.000 --> 48:53.840
and had their best friends be their maid of honor,

48:53.840 --> 48:56.160
I don't think that best friend is rolling up at 28

48:56.160 --> 48:57.840
going, you picked your sister?

48:57.840 --> 48:58.960
But we had a deal.

48:58.960 --> 49:01.440
I feel like if you haven't talked about it in the last year,

49:02.720 --> 49:04.960
she probably isn't thinking about it either.

49:04.960 --> 49:06.480
Or if she is, it's like,

49:06.480 --> 49:08.320
oh, I remember when we talked about that once.

49:08.320 --> 49:09.760
Man, I haven't seen her in forever.

49:09.760 --> 49:11.920
But if you're getting married at 27

49:11.920 --> 49:14.480
and you made somebody a promise at 21,

49:14.480 --> 49:17.440
Jacob Dunkel, that maybe they would be included

49:17.440 --> 49:19.920
in a special way on your special day, Jacob Dunkel,

49:19.920 --> 49:22.800
promises were made on the river that night

49:23.440 --> 49:25.280
that apparently I'm the only one that remembers.

49:26.480 --> 49:28.880
Um, does she actually say that her sister

49:28.880 --> 49:30.000
would be the maid of honor

49:30.000 --> 49:32.160
should she not choose the best friend?

49:32.160 --> 49:32.480
Is that-

49:32.480 --> 49:35.600
No, she does say she's becoming closer with other friends.

49:36.160 --> 49:38.320
Yeah, you know what, honestly,

49:38.320 --> 49:40.160
and this is kind of pragmatic of me,

49:40.160 --> 49:43.440
but like, I say have your sister do it

49:43.440 --> 49:45.760
just because you're gonna keep knowing your sister

49:45.760 --> 49:46.880
and you're never gonna regret that.

49:46.880 --> 49:48.000
And it sounds like you're not like,

49:48.000 --> 49:51.120
like, great with friendships right now

49:51.120 --> 49:52.560
at this point in your life.

49:52.560 --> 49:53.360
And maybe you just-

49:53.360 --> 49:55.280
It's kind of a rebuilding year for friendships.

49:55.280 --> 49:57.440
Yeah, it sounds like you're kind of a rebuilding year.

49:57.440 --> 49:59.600
Maybe just stick with the one relationship

49:59.600 --> 50:01.360
that you are gonna continue to have.

50:01.920 --> 50:03.520
Because the other side of that is

50:03.520 --> 50:06.160
if you don't have a clear front runner

50:06.160 --> 50:08.000
for your maid of honor or matron of honor,

50:08.000 --> 50:09.120
best man or whatever-

50:09.120 --> 50:11.040
Then have a reality show about it.

50:11.040 --> 50:13.200
Yeah, going with the relative,

50:13.200 --> 50:14.720
especially a sibling,

50:14.720 --> 50:17.520
is usually like no one in your friend group

50:17.520 --> 50:20.240
is going to be upset that they weren't picked.

50:20.240 --> 50:20.480
Sure.

50:20.480 --> 50:21.760
I feel like everyone kind of goes,

50:21.760 --> 50:22.960
well, yeah, it's a sibling.

50:22.960 --> 50:23.600
Well, yeah.

50:23.600 --> 50:25.520
I just think, I think there's like,

50:25.520 --> 50:26.640
the thing everyone thinks about

50:26.640 --> 50:28.160
when they're having a wedding is,

50:28.720 --> 50:30.480
will this person be offended

50:31.280 --> 50:33.680
if I don't include them in some way?

50:33.680 --> 50:34.960
What you don't think about,

50:34.960 --> 50:36.400
and what you absolutely should,

50:36.400 --> 50:37.520
because it's the thing that,

50:37.520 --> 50:39.680
it's the only thing you think about the day of,

50:39.680 --> 50:45.280
is this like giving this person too much authority

50:45.280 --> 50:47.920
or credit or involvement in this wedding

50:47.920 --> 50:49.280
that does not reflect

50:49.280 --> 50:51.920
where our relationship actually is.

50:51.920 --> 50:54.640
Like if you invite somebody

50:54.640 --> 50:57.280
that you've hung out with twice,

50:57.280 --> 50:59.040
they're going to feel kind of weird,

50:59.040 --> 51:01.920
and you might feel kind of weird having them there.

51:01.920 --> 51:03.920
That's not to say that any of us

51:03.920 --> 51:05.680
necessarily did that for our weddings,

51:05.680 --> 51:07.520
but it was like we realized

51:07.520 --> 51:08.960
while we were inviting people,

51:10.080 --> 51:11.600
oh man, it's going to be weird

51:11.600 --> 51:12.960
if that person's there.

51:12.960 --> 51:14.640
That will be weird for us.

51:14.640 --> 51:18.400
Yeah, I'm usually mister keep everybody happy,

51:19.200 --> 51:22.400
but weddings specifically

51:22.400 --> 51:26.240
seem to me an opportunity to really be honest,

51:26.240 --> 51:28.240
and not punitively honest.

51:28.240 --> 51:30.560
It's just not an opportunity to play politics.

51:31.680 --> 51:33.840
It is a perfect, honest statement

51:33.840 --> 51:35.520
of where your relationship is at,

51:35.520 --> 51:39.520
and if they want to fix that later or whatever,

51:41.440 --> 51:41.920
that's fine,

51:41.920 --> 51:44.400
but no one has a right to get hurt by that.

51:44.400 --> 51:47.120
It is literally the most honest thing you can say.

51:47.120 --> 51:48.560
There are other people in my life

51:49.120 --> 51:51.680
that I want with me,

51:51.680 --> 51:53.360
and it is perfectly reasonable

51:53.360 --> 51:54.880
for you to be as selfish as you want

51:54.880 --> 51:56.480
and not consider other people's feelings

51:56.480 --> 51:58.160
because it is your wedding.

51:58.160 --> 52:01.680
It is your day to do it.

52:01.680 --> 52:03.600
One of the criteria Teresa and I used

52:03.600 --> 52:05.440
was 20 years from now,

52:05.440 --> 52:06.240
30 years from now,

52:06.240 --> 52:07.920
when we look at our wedding pictures,

52:08.480 --> 52:10.000
who will be the people

52:10.000 --> 52:13.600
that we would regret not seeing in them,

52:13.600 --> 52:14.720
and who would be the people

52:14.720 --> 52:16.480
that we would still be hanging out with

52:16.480 --> 52:18.240
and reminiscing about the day with,

52:18.800 --> 52:20.000
and not like,

52:20.000 --> 52:20.960
hey, who in this moment

52:20.960 --> 52:22.320
have we had a really good time with?

52:22.320 --> 52:23.920
Who sells us weed right now?

52:25.760 --> 52:27.520
When you're 70 and you're thinking

52:27.520 --> 52:28.480
about your memories

52:28.480 --> 52:29.920
before both of you are shuffled off

52:29.920 --> 52:31.120
this mortal coil,

52:31.120 --> 52:33.120
you don't want the last thing you see

52:33.120 --> 52:34.880
is you don't want that to be weed, Brian.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.160
You don't want it to be karaoke Kim

52:38.160 --> 52:38.640
or whatever.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.120
Who is the person that if you went

52:41.120 --> 52:42.080
through some shit,

52:42.080 --> 52:43.040
that's not your weed deal,

52:43.040 --> 52:43.600
unless it is.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.200
What if you have a really solid connection

52:47.200 --> 52:47.840
with your weed deal

52:47.840 --> 52:48.320
and you're like,

52:48.320 --> 52:49.520
we want weed Brian up there.

52:49.520 --> 52:50.880
Or what if you have a very tenuous,

52:50.880 --> 52:51.840
you have a tenuous connection

52:51.840 --> 52:52.560
with weed Brian,

52:53.440 --> 52:55.200
but then he turns out,

52:55.200 --> 52:56.160
hey, you know who we should

52:56.160 --> 52:56.880
hang out with more?

52:56.880 --> 52:57.680
Weed Brian.

52:57.680 --> 52:59.120
Yeah, I like him a lot.

52:59.120 --> 53:00.080
And then you're 70,

53:00.080 --> 53:01.600
who's sitting next to you

53:01.600 --> 53:02.960
as you're flipping through

53:02.960 --> 53:03.920
your photo album?

53:03.920 --> 53:05.680
It is weed Brian and he's 70

53:05.680 --> 53:07.200
and he's still fucking parties

53:07.200 --> 53:09.200
harder than any of you motherfuckers.

53:09.200 --> 53:11.200
But in a really like conscientious,

53:11.200 --> 53:12.560
like I always feel closer

53:12.560 --> 53:13.920
when I'm partying with weed Brian.

53:13.920 --> 53:16.320
I feel closer to my chosen deity.

53:16.320 --> 53:17.520
Safe way.

53:17.520 --> 53:19.200
He plays shuffleboard with me

53:19.200 --> 53:19.920
on Thursdays

53:19.920 --> 53:21.440
and he sells me the dankest kush.

53:22.240 --> 53:24.000
It's tight, tight bud.

53:24.000 --> 53:24.720
I love Brian.

53:24.720 --> 53:26.720
I love Brian and I love his product.

53:27.520 --> 53:28.400
Here's a Yahoo.

53:28.400 --> 53:29.680
It was sent in by Drew Davenport.

53:29.680 --> 53:30.160
Thank you Drew.

53:30.160 --> 53:31.760
It's by Yahoo answers user bunny

53:31.760 --> 53:32.320
who asks,

53:32.880 --> 53:34.880
have you ever felt someone's body heat

53:34.880 --> 53:35.760
when they were near you

53:35.760 --> 53:37.120
but weren't touching you?

53:37.120 --> 53:43.520
It's so cool.

53:43.520 --> 53:44.480
Sorry, sorry.

53:44.480 --> 53:45.120
What were you saying?

53:45.120 --> 53:46.320
I was too busy throwing up.

53:47.360 --> 53:48.320
Dear listeners,

53:48.320 --> 53:49.600
if you are ever aware

53:49.600 --> 53:50.240
that you were having

53:50.240 --> 53:51.440
this experience with me,

53:51.440 --> 53:53.120
please do not make me aware of it.

53:53.120 --> 53:54.320
But that's not their fault

53:54.320 --> 53:55.280
because you run hot

53:55.280 --> 53:57.200
and you it's true Justin.

53:57.200 --> 53:59.280
You're a fucking hot chassis,

53:59.280 --> 54:00.640
especially post show

54:00.640 --> 54:02.080
when I'm in my kimono.

54:02.080 --> 54:02.720
Oh my God.

54:03.360 --> 54:04.960
The makeup's coming off.

54:04.960 --> 54:06.880
That's pure sexuality there.

54:06.880 --> 54:08.160
It's not about sexuality.

54:08.160 --> 54:08.800
We're talking about

54:08.800 --> 54:11.360
literal physical heat Celsius Kelvin.

54:11.360 --> 54:12.000
I'm nothing.

54:12.000 --> 54:12.560
I'm nothing.

54:12.560 --> 54:13.840
But I run cool.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.360
I get like a lizard up on that stage.

54:16.160 --> 54:17.520
I gotta, I gotta think fast.

54:17.520 --> 54:18.000
I have quick.

54:18.000 --> 54:18.400
That's true.

54:18.400 --> 54:19.600
Griffin doesn't show up

54:19.600 --> 54:20.560
on the thermo scan.

54:20.560 --> 54:21.280
No, I don't.

54:21.280 --> 54:22.000
I'm invisible.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.200
Can't be targeted by drones.

54:23.200 --> 54:24.480
Nice try Obama.

54:24.480 --> 54:25.520
Never tell you at the time

54:25.520 --> 54:26.800
Griffin killed predator.

54:26.800 --> 54:27.680
I killed predator

54:27.680 --> 54:28.880
with my cold, cold body.

54:28.880 --> 54:29.520
I did a show.

54:29.520 --> 54:30.320
What did you do?

54:30.320 --> 54:30.960
He says, he said,

54:30.960 --> 54:32.960
I hear jokes and I love these jokes.

54:32.960 --> 54:33.920
I did.

54:33.920 --> 54:34.480
Got behind you.

54:34.480 --> 54:35.200
And what's funny,

54:35.200 --> 54:35.920
Justin runs hot.

54:35.920 --> 54:36.720
Griffin runs cool.

54:36.720 --> 54:37.520
I run just right.

54:37.520 --> 54:38.160
You run just right.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.560
I feel it.

54:42.560 --> 54:44.800
Is this, but is this like kind of,

54:44.800 --> 54:46.320
I think this is one of the many,

54:46.320 --> 54:48.000
many things on this earth

54:48.560 --> 54:50.080
that science just can't explain.

54:51.600 --> 54:52.320
Body heat.

54:52.320 --> 54:53.920
Well, I think they got it.

54:53.920 --> 54:54.720
I think they've probably

54:54.720 --> 54:55.200
figured that out.

54:55.200 --> 54:56.480
This is just one of those.

54:56.480 --> 54:57.680
It's just one of those things

54:57.680 --> 54:58.560
like chakras.

54:58.560 --> 55:00.000
It's like Kim trails.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
It's like ESP.

55:03.680 --> 55:04.240
It's like.

55:04.240 --> 55:06.160
It's like why someone's hair

55:06.160 --> 55:06.720
smells good.

55:06.720 --> 55:07.440
EDM.

55:07.440 --> 55:08.640
Why does hair smell good?

55:10.240 --> 55:10.880
It's just, it's,

55:10.880 --> 55:11.600
you know what it is?

55:11.600 --> 55:14.000
It's my, it's my aura

55:14.000 --> 55:15.200
and it has a color

55:15.200 --> 55:16.160
and you can look at that color

55:16.160 --> 55:16.800
and you can tell what my

55:16.800 --> 55:17.680
astrological sign is.

55:17.680 --> 55:18.800
And that color is warm.

55:19.520 --> 55:20.320
Well, no.

55:20.320 --> 55:20.800
Well, yes.

55:21.520 --> 55:22.240
The color is warm,

55:22.240 --> 55:23.600
but it has nothing to do with the,

55:23.600 --> 55:25.280
has nothing to do with feeling it

55:25.280 --> 55:25.920
and picking it up

55:25.920 --> 55:26.960
with your thermoreceptors.

55:26.960 --> 55:29.280
You can, there's an extra receptor.

55:29.280 --> 55:30.000
You're saying that

55:30.000 --> 55:31.680
we interpret it as body heat,

55:31.680 --> 55:32.480
but that's just because

55:32.480 --> 55:33.840
we're reacting to the aura

55:33.840 --> 55:34.480
that this person has.

55:34.480 --> 55:34.720
Yeah.

55:34.720 --> 55:35.920
You're feeling my color.

55:36.880 --> 55:37.520
Uh-huh.

55:37.520 --> 55:38.240
It's an ochre.

55:39.440 --> 55:40.960
You just don't understand.

55:40.960 --> 55:42.160
I feel like these concepts

55:42.160 --> 55:42.880
that I'm giving you.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.240
I mean, body heat is a concrete thing.

55:46.240 --> 55:47.360
You have a temperature

55:47.360 --> 55:48.160
and if someone's close.

55:48.160 --> 55:49.280
What causes that temperature?

55:49.280 --> 55:49.520
What?

55:49.520 --> 55:50.480
Right now I'm sweating.

55:51.280 --> 55:52.880
Blood burning of calories.

55:53.440 --> 55:53.840
Okay.

55:53.840 --> 55:55.040
But what are those?

55:56.080 --> 55:56.400
Come on.

55:56.400 --> 55:57.200
Let's do this too.

55:57.200 --> 55:58.320
Let's, you started this.

55:58.320 --> 55:59.520
Let's finish this together.

55:59.520 --> 56:00.720
I will take you down this road.

56:00.720 --> 56:01.200
All right.

56:01.200 --> 56:03.280
What's, what even is a calorie?

56:03.280 --> 56:05.200
A calorie is a unit of energy.

56:05.200 --> 56:05.760
Okay.

56:05.760 --> 56:07.200
What's, where does that energy

56:07.200 --> 56:07.760
come from though?

56:08.640 --> 56:09.840
From the food.

56:09.840 --> 56:10.080
Right.

56:11.280 --> 56:11.600
Okay.

56:11.600 --> 56:13.680
I made a loaf of beautiful

56:13.680 --> 56:15.360
sunflower oil bread yesterday

56:16.240 --> 56:17.760
and I don't remember.

56:17.760 --> 56:18.320
Let me think.

56:18.320 --> 56:20.400
I put sunflower in it

56:20.400 --> 56:21.440
and I had ancient,

56:22.800 --> 56:24.480
I had reclaimed grains

56:24.480 --> 56:25.360
that I put in there.

56:26.080 --> 56:28.640
A vegan egg that I put in there.

56:28.640 --> 56:30.080
I don't remember the part

56:30.080 --> 56:31.200
of the recipe

56:31.200 --> 56:34.080
where I sprinkled on some energy in it.

56:34.080 --> 56:36.240
So just food for thought

56:36.240 --> 56:37.120
and food for food.

56:37.120 --> 56:38.160
Well, Gervin, I feel like

56:38.160 --> 56:38.960
you've won this one.

56:39.520 --> 56:40.720
Really put Justin in this place.

56:40.720 --> 56:42.000
I don't remember putting energy

56:42.000 --> 56:42.640
in my bread.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.920
No, I mean, it's Justin.

56:45.920 --> 56:46.720
You look like a dumbo.

56:46.720 --> 56:48.080
You look like a dumb piece of shit

56:48.080 --> 56:49.200
right now because you tried

56:49.200 --> 56:50.080
to step to me.

56:50.080 --> 56:50.960
I'm just saying there are things

56:50.960 --> 56:52.240
out there science can't explain.

56:52.240 --> 56:52.880
And I'm saying heat.

56:52.880 --> 56:53.680
And when they try to,

56:53.680 --> 56:54.480
they look like stupid assholes.

56:54.480 --> 56:55.760
They look like dumb assholes.

56:55.760 --> 56:57.120
I'm saying heat, energy,

56:58.000 --> 56:58.720
hair smells.

56:59.920 --> 57:00.480
Yeah.

57:00.480 --> 57:01.440
That good feeling you get

57:01.440 --> 57:02.800
when you dance with a loved one.

57:03.680 --> 57:04.560
Can you explain that feeling

57:04.560 --> 57:05.280
to me, Justin?

57:05.280 --> 57:05.920
Dr. Science?

57:06.480 --> 57:07.520
Hey, Dr. Oz,

57:07.520 --> 57:08.240
because that's what you sound

57:08.240 --> 57:09.200
like right now, a fraud.

57:10.640 --> 57:11.440
Got them.

57:11.440 --> 57:12.480
I guess I just,

57:13.840 --> 57:15.040
maybe Justin's just buying

57:15.040 --> 57:16.000
into some of those,

57:16.000 --> 57:17.440
quote, text books,

57:17.440 --> 57:18.880
end quote, I've heard about.

57:18.880 --> 57:19.600
It's just like a,

57:20.160 --> 57:21.680
it's like a unit of energy.

57:21.680 --> 57:22.320
Oh my God.

57:22.320 --> 57:23.360
Yeah, according to what,

57:23.360 --> 57:24.320
what studies have you done,

57:24.320 --> 57:25.360
Justin, that have proved that?

57:26.160 --> 57:26.880
What have you seen with

57:26.880 --> 57:27.920
your own goddamn eyeballs?

57:28.480 --> 57:30.080
I've burnt food.

57:30.080 --> 57:31.040
You burnt food.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.080
Well, that seems wasteful.

57:32.080 --> 57:32.960
Take that Africa.

57:32.960 --> 57:33.120
Yeah.

57:34.000 --> 57:34.640
Hope you guys,

57:34.640 --> 57:35.520
I hope you guys didn't need that.

57:35.520 --> 57:36.080
Oh, what's that?

57:36.080 --> 57:37.280
You super needed it.

57:37.280 --> 57:38.400
You super needed that

57:38.400 --> 57:39.680
cereal that I burnt.

57:39.680 --> 57:40.320
Interesting.

57:40.320 --> 57:41.600
Well, at least Justin

57:41.600 --> 57:42.240
learned something.

57:43.040 --> 57:44.560
Oh, people are dying in the streets.

57:44.560 --> 57:46.720
Well, Justin learned one thing

57:46.720 --> 57:47.520
that it doesn't,

57:47.520 --> 57:48.640
doesn't even actually exist.

57:48.640 --> 57:49.600
Cause how did the energy get

57:49.600 --> 57:51.040
in the cereal in the first place?

57:51.040 --> 57:51.920
You figure that out

57:51.920 --> 57:52.960
and then you can come talk to me

57:52.960 --> 57:53.360
and tell them,

57:53.360 --> 57:54.000
why don't you think

57:54.000 --> 57:55.200
about making some donations?

57:56.240 --> 57:57.680
They fortify it.

57:57.680 --> 57:58.400
Oh my God.

57:58.400 --> 57:59.440
Fortify it.

57:59.440 --> 58:00.160
It's calories.

58:01.280 --> 58:02.640
I would, I'm going to,

58:02.640 --> 58:05.840
I'm going to just dissolve you

58:05.840 --> 58:07.600
with all your logic's

58:07.600 --> 58:08.720
gonna come crumbling around you.

58:08.720 --> 58:09.600
You're going to dissolve

58:09.600 --> 58:10.560
at the molecular level,

58:10.560 --> 58:11.360
which is something I'd say

58:11.360 --> 58:12.880
if I believed in molecules.

58:12.880 --> 58:14.080
So this has been my brother,

58:14.080 --> 58:14.880
my brother and me.

58:15.760 --> 58:16.800
It's been our last episode.

58:16.800 --> 58:18.000
It's been our final episode.

58:18.000 --> 58:18.800
I hope everybody,

58:18.800 --> 58:19.840
reject science.

58:19.840 --> 58:21.600
I hope everybody learned something

58:21.600 --> 58:22.560
and I hope that you heard me

58:22.560 --> 58:24.080
do the quotation marks

58:24.080 --> 58:25.760
when I said that just then.

58:25.760 --> 58:27.040
I think those are scare quotes.

58:27.040 --> 58:27.840
Is that what those are?

58:27.840 --> 58:29.040
Um, thank you for

58:29.040 --> 58:30.160
listening to our program.

58:30.800 --> 58:32.560
Uh, we hope you had

58:32.560 --> 58:34.080
some fun listening to it.

58:34.080 --> 58:35.520
Uh, it is optimal

58:36.320 --> 58:37.200
for you to listen to it

58:37.200 --> 58:38.400
while you're on Norco.

58:38.400 --> 58:39.840
So I would highly suggest

58:39.840 --> 58:41.040
taking some of that

58:41.040 --> 58:42.000
to really get it.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.160
This is our most 4D episode.

58:44.160 --> 58:46.000
Yeah, uh, yeah,

58:46.000 --> 58:47.040
it's got sense around

58:47.040 --> 58:48.400
and D box and everything.

58:48.400 --> 58:51.040
Um, so we've got like,

58:51.040 --> 58:52.800
uh, Travis,

58:52.800 --> 58:54.720
you've got new merch written here.

58:54.720 --> 58:55.920
I don't see any new merch

58:55.920 --> 58:56.960
up on the store.

58:56.960 --> 58:58.880
So the new merch should be up this week.

58:58.880 --> 59:00.160
Um, keep an eye out at it.

59:00.160 --> 59:01.840
We're not exactly sure what date,

59:01.840 --> 59:02.720
but hopefully soon.

59:02.720 --> 59:04.240
And that merch is, uh,

59:04.240 --> 59:05.200
new tote bags,

59:05.200 --> 59:06.960
buttons, uh, stickers,

59:06.960 --> 59:07.920
bumper stickers.

59:07.920 --> 59:09.120
Uh, it's really, really

59:09.120 --> 59:09.920
put up the patch.

59:09.920 --> 59:10.960
I love that patch.

59:10.960 --> 59:11.920
Yeah, the patch,

59:11.920 --> 59:13.680
the fraternal order of brothers patch.

59:13.680 --> 59:16.320
It's so, so, so done by Justin Russo,

59:16.320 --> 59:17.120
who, who had,

59:17.120 --> 59:18.320
we haven't thanked him in a long time,

59:18.320 --> 59:21.040
but he did so much of our artwork

59:21.040 --> 59:22.880
and he's, he's so goddamn talented.

59:22.880 --> 59:24.480
Um, that's our visual,

59:24.480 --> 59:25.840
our visual identity

59:25.840 --> 59:28.000
is Justin Russo.

59:28.000 --> 59:28.960
Thank you very much, Justin.

59:28.960 --> 59:30.960
And thanks, thanks to Bob Ball

59:30.960 --> 59:31.600

59:31.600 --> 59:33.120
We haven't thanked him in a long time either.

59:33.120 --> 59:34.320
Yeah, thank you, Bob Ball.

59:34.320 --> 59:36.240
Um, and Bob Ball VO is his website.

He's one of the best humans.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.480
He's a good human.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.120
He's a good human.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.320

I've been trying to be a little bit more involved in it.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.120
But, and what's great about it is

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.640
you have to request permission to be in it.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.000
we can just like boot them.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:36.400
And then-

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.440
They won't let me in.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.240
I've been requesting.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:38.480
