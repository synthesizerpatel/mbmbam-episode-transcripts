00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better, it's better with you

00:53.940 --> 00:55.940
It's better, it's better with you

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
It's better, it's better with you

01:09.640 --> 01:14.460
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

01:14.780 --> 01:17.020
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:17.020 --> 01:22.860
I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy. I'm a sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

01:22.860 --> 01:26.380
Oh my god guys guys guys, but what what is it trap?

01:26.380 --> 01:29.260
I listen if there's one thing I know about the two of you

01:29.260 --> 01:31.780
It's that you're always looking for a good investment

01:31.780 --> 01:38.940
And I hope you guys are ready to get in on the ground floor because I've got a really exciting opportunity for you guys

01:40.460 --> 01:44.860
So much money and I want to make I want to turn it into more money by doing no work

01:44.860 --> 01:48.580
I don't know. Hey, yeah, so happy to hear that. So I

01:49.100 --> 01:53.420
Was approached by some scientists and they're looking for investors

01:54.260 --> 01:57.020
They are going to open up what kind of scientists? Oh

01:57.660 --> 02:04.860
Like really really smart. They have like lab coats and what's their like, but what's their like field? Uh, let's say genetics

02:05.780 --> 02:07.140
very

02:07.140 --> 02:12.060
promising very promising they're planning to open up a

02:12.060 --> 02:13.540
a

02:13.540 --> 02:15.540
experience park and

02:15.820 --> 02:17.820
They will be

02:18.060 --> 02:20.380
Bringing back and you guys aren't gonna believe this

02:21.460 --> 02:23.460
dinosaurs

02:25.980 --> 02:33.020
Dinosaurs and they are looking for investors to help fund this park and this thing. Oh my god guys

02:33.020 --> 02:38.460
It's gonna be a huge hit. Yeah, the return on investment is all but guaranteed

02:38.460 --> 02:43.500
So can I can they will they name a stegosaurus after me if I give them like a hundred bucks?

02:44.100 --> 02:47.340
They are looking for a little bit more than that. I

02:48.300 --> 02:55.060
They're looking in the range of like mmm, and this is this is gonna pucker you up a bit, but like five million dollars

02:56.500 --> 03:00.620
Okay, the five million be going towards yeah

03:01.380 --> 03:06.420
Making dinosaurs and feeding the dinosaurs and building walls for the dinosaurs

03:06.420 --> 03:10.340
I could probably make you a dinosaur for like ten ten large

03:11.340 --> 03:16.180
Well ten G's, I mean maybe split it three ways, but listen guys listen

03:16.180 --> 03:18.500
I know I know that that kind of number is very big

03:18.860 --> 03:24.700
But once this park opens and everybody starts going to it, we're gonna make so much money back. Okay

03:24.700 --> 03:30.020
I'm gonna I hate to put you on the spot. Okay, but you are now the official representative

03:30.020 --> 03:39.220
Representative of the park understandable. Yeah, okay. Um, the what if we bring them back

03:40.100 --> 03:47.980
They're a danger and I missus and this is my question. Okay, if we bring them back, is there not a danger?

03:49.100 --> 03:52.460
That they will sort of run. I

03:53.380 --> 03:59.380
Mean, I don't want to be offensive. I know PC culture, but kind of run wild on humanity

03:59.380 --> 04:04.820
Oh, well, oh, did you miss where I said we'd be building walls? There would be big kick-ass walls

04:04.820 --> 04:11.460
We'd have walls. That's and the other thing juice is the reason the caveman's got pwned is they didn't have our

04:12.780 --> 04:15.380
bazookas, yeah, okay our

04:16.900 --> 04:18.800
Electricity weapons

04:18.800 --> 04:25.340
Dinosaurs hate those so I'm not worried so much about that. I'm more worried about that. Dinosaurs are not sexy

04:25.340 --> 04:31.180
so I guess could we could we give them like big boobies big jugs and

04:31.700 --> 04:32.700
wieners

04:32.700 --> 04:36.100
That's already part. Yeah, that's definitely a little in our audience

04:36.620 --> 04:40.520
No, no, I don't think so. I think because we'll have we'll have a little bit of something for everyone

04:40.780 --> 04:41.280
Yeah

04:41.280 --> 04:46.240
Not all that not all the dinosaurs are gonna have big juicy jugs and like we can't do that to a terror

04:46.860 --> 04:53.140
Pterodactyl because it would fall out of the sky. You got to balance that but like and so it's like some t-rex

04:53.140 --> 04:56.260
Yes, we'll have being juicy drinks

04:57.220 --> 04:59.220
Big big beautiful

04:59.380 --> 05:06.140
Jugs or what? Yeah, let's let's so up. What depends on how much we invest. Let's pivot. That's true

05:06.140 --> 05:11.820
Here's me at the dinosaur park. Where's the t-rex over there? Oh, yeah, that's pretty cool. Wow. Damn. That's a good t-rex

05:11.820 --> 05:15.980
Well time to go home. How are you gonna make it sticky?

05:17.300 --> 05:18.940
Right, right, right

05:18.940 --> 05:23.900
Well, we're planning to have a couple restaurants that will then serve chopped up dinosaurs

05:26.100 --> 05:32.760
Okay, yeah, but they will have dinosaur steaks so you can find out what the dinosaurs tasted like, you know what I mean?

05:33.420 --> 05:36.940
that's actually if I'm gonna be honest, that's kind of the primary focus of

05:37.700 --> 05:43.260
The park at this point. Yeah, we will be churning these dinosaurs out at a rate

05:43.260 --> 05:47.740
that to keep up with a hunger base

05:47.740 --> 05:52.940
Yeah, okay, and that can be like our NFTs, which is which is new food

05:53.580 --> 05:54.660
pterodactyl

05:54.660 --> 05:55.980
exactly

05:55.980 --> 05:56.980
also

05:56.980 --> 06:03.260
At this this this one's kind of important. We're gonna make the dinosaurs bigger and bigger and bigger but also

06:03.820 --> 06:09.220
Yeah, and this is my innovation that I kind of gave to them some of them smaller and smaller and smaller

06:09.220 --> 06:15.960
That could be cool. What if we made this small dinosaurs big and the big dinosaurs small and then like let everybody see them

06:16.660 --> 06:21.220
Get revenge on like a tiny little t-rex that they could just kind of stomp around

06:21.700 --> 06:25.220
You know we you touched on this briefly trap

06:25.220 --> 06:30.020
But I do think the possibilities of eating the dinosaurs is massive. Thank you

06:30.020 --> 06:37.020
Um, I think that if we're breeding them already we're creating them with you know, big beautiful juicy jugs

06:37.020 --> 06:40.580
that's already I'm actually gonna put a I'm gonna put a

06:41.580 --> 06:46.580
Limit on that I'm talking about that and it the limit was two times ago

06:46.940 --> 06:51.620
Okay, so that's off the table, but we are still talking about eating these gorgeous

06:51.620 --> 06:56.660
Well, yeah, and I'll tell you this guys these geneticists have made some serious breakthrough

06:56.700 --> 07:02.720
They said that they can breed these dinosaurs with inherent teriyaki flavor. Okay

07:02.720 --> 07:08.360
It's just right in their blood right in their DNA. Well, is there a worry is there dino DNA, please?

07:08.640 --> 07:15.880
It is there a worry is there a concern that that will make them too delicious to their compatriots now if I'm struggling

07:15.880 --> 07:21.840
I'm waiting for my next bucket of sheep slop and I am and Craig start smelling real good

07:22.640 --> 07:28.760
A lot of umami loft enough. Yeah. Yeah, I might have to go in for a taste now Justin

07:28.760 --> 07:31.480
I'm thank you for asking the scientists did say

07:31.480 --> 07:36.000
that it will not make them more violent towards each other but

07:36.320 --> 07:42.400
The teriyaki does get in their brains and just make them more violent in general more aggressive

07:42.560 --> 07:47.960
So there will be a they will be delicious and angry, but I we don't see that as a problem

07:47.960 --> 07:51.520
Also, it will increase their vertical leap tenfold. Yeah

07:56.080 --> 07:59.600
How would they know that they could jump that high right like they won't know

07:59.600 --> 08:02.360
Are you telling me the secret is that they have to believe in themselves?

08:03.200 --> 08:08.240
Well, Justin, I mean that's not scientific. But yes, we'll have a tinder dactyl. We'll have a stegosaurus

08:08.680 --> 08:13.360
There's a lot of opportunities here that I'm really try tip ceratops

08:13.360 --> 08:18.000
There's another great option for one very good cut cut up and eat these. Yeah, perfect

08:18.600 --> 08:20.600
and

08:20.640 --> 08:24.120
Scene, thank you so much for joining us T-bone Rex

08:25.000 --> 08:26.760
on this

08:26.760 --> 08:33.620
Sponsored episode. I don't know if you guys are excited but all two hours and 26 minutes of Jurassic World Dominion

08:34.480 --> 08:36.480
Is coming my way

08:37.440 --> 08:39.920
This evening at the local multi

08:41.560 --> 08:44.640
Excited to get a seat for this this this ride

08:44.640 --> 08:51.240
I I will say Justin the thing that was in the movie what they resurrect dinosaurs

08:51.240 --> 08:57.040
But what the movie resurrects in my heart is hope and let me tell you why Justin and maybe

08:57.200 --> 09:01.600
resurrects not the right word because it doesn't make it seem like some kind of dinosaur Jesus, but

09:02.480 --> 09:09.600
For me Justin. Yeah, I just can't wait to see how they once again are surprised that dinosaurs are running amok

09:09.960 --> 09:14.840
Right, you think after a while after six of these ding-dang things, right?

09:14.840 --> 09:19.340
We get to the point where they'd be like, oh, what's that die? Yeah, we're fucked man. Yeah

09:19.340 --> 09:24.420
I should have invented some sort of dinosaur poison certainly at this. Thank you

09:24.420 --> 09:31.640
They are animals and what do humans excel at if not poisoning the animals?

09:31.820 --> 09:37.900
Yeah, unlike other I was inspired to take on another sponsored episode because I was listening to our

09:38.820 --> 09:43.660
McElroy family fun hour sure sponsored by two teams don't need to say the name of the brand can see don't well

09:43.660 --> 09:48.220
They already I mean they're a dear friend a dear friend of the brand of our brand

09:48.220 --> 09:52.820
It's a brand partnership and I really miss doing those but people aren't exactly the line

09:52.820 --> 09:55.260
I know there's a lot of other podcasts out there. Yeah these days

09:55.260 --> 10:02.080
So this one is kind of on spec in the ass. I feel like Universal should just donate whatever

10:03.100 --> 10:05.820
They feel is fair to us. Oh

10:06.780 --> 10:13.780
Interesting. Yeah, so like we'll do the we'll do the episode right and then hope that they hear it

10:13.780 --> 10:15.980
I guess that I don't know how to reach them. Yeah

10:15.980 --> 10:21.860
Yeah, and then they'll sort of like pay us whatever they think is fair for this branded content. It's on spec

10:21.860 --> 10:27.700
Well when we're done if you guys want I can like put this onto like a CD or disk and like send it to Sam Neil

10:27.700 --> 10:33.980
I'm so can you get this to somebody? It's so cool that you know how to do that. Yeah. Thank you. I

10:34.980 --> 10:37.280
Tried I can't get my computer to do it

10:37.280 --> 10:42.660
I put CDs in my computer and it just starts playing the songs on them. Oh, no, no, no, you got to have a burner

10:42.660 --> 10:45.940
I can't tell you guys something. I'm great. What?

10:46.460 --> 10:51.780
This is great is I want to keep it on Jurassic Park just for a little bit Jurassic World Justin, please

10:52.300 --> 10:55.140
Jurassic World Dominion huge opening

10:56.060 --> 11:00.460
Is what we're trying to get them going that long people heard this flick listen

11:00.460 --> 11:03.460
People are sick of dinosaurs, but we're gonna bring it back. You're welcome

11:03.460 --> 11:07.840
Just like they brought back the dinosaurs got a story from the Hollywood Reporter here for you

11:07.840 --> 11:13.840
Um, you know Sam Neal's back for this one. Oh, yeah my buddy

11:13.920 --> 11:21.200
Yeah, your buddy Sam Neal is back for this one get not the team back Alan Grant Ellie Sattler. Sure the whole team

11:22.800 --> 11:29.400
Skronk you remember you guys remember skronk the big one the caveman they resurrected to help them kill all the dinosaurs and I think it was

11:29.960 --> 11:32.280
Three that was a three. Yeah

11:32.280 --> 11:39.940
three because that guy parachuted into the pterodactyl enclosure and saw a frozen caveman in the wall and then he like

11:39.940 --> 11:43.600
Landed over there and then he like held the lighter up to the ice for a while

11:43.600 --> 11:47.320
It was Vince Vaughn and he was getting pecked apart by the pterodactyls

11:47.320 --> 11:50.800
But then skronk broke out of the ice and he was like, I'm your granddad

11:51.080 --> 11:57.240
No, actually, I believe Vince Vaughn played skronk in this one because I call dibs. Oh, sorry

11:57.240 --> 12:03.800
Oh, sorry. Okay. So you guys remember in the first Jurassic Park one of the first ones they see is that Brachiosaurus and they're like

12:03.800 --> 12:06.720
Yeah, I'm nutting over like yeah, they've been losing

12:07.320 --> 12:12.360
His pants he's like, you know, he's like so classic that I thought by the way

12:12.360 --> 12:15.240
I thought the sound effect they used was a little over-the-top but go on

12:15.240 --> 12:19.960
Yeah, so Hollywood Reporter is interviewing Sam Neal press junket for this film

12:19.960 --> 12:27.960
in 20 and this is the story says in 2018 Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom the fifth installment in the Jurassic franchise the

12:27.960 --> 12:30.920
beloved Brachiosaurus from the 1993 film

12:31.480 --> 12:36.320
Perished as a result of a volcanic eruption on ice and nublar and Neal

12:37.280 --> 12:39.280
until now

12:39.440 --> 12:42.960
Meaning in the interview was unaware that it was the same

12:42.960 --> 12:49.320
Brachiosaurus that had bowled Grant and Sadler over in 1993. So here's the

12:50.560 --> 12:56.180
Quote from Sam. I didn't know it was the same one. Well, that is heartbreaking

12:57.760 --> 12:59.760
Such a sweet creature

13:02.400 --> 13:04.400
You tender-hearted

13:04.400 --> 13:13.680
Dear man, why? Wait, hold on stop the interview. Stop the interview. What what it was the same one

13:13.680 --> 13:15.680
What are you talking about?

13:15.880 --> 13:23.080
No, someone would have told me I got I I've hold on I've got to call somebody about this. I need confirmation

13:23.080 --> 13:33.160
Oh Sam also, I didn't know is it how are we supposed to know that he has somebody he has a tattoo. Oh

13:35.080 --> 13:40.160
And it's kind of like play but he did have a Dino tattoo from Flintstones, yeah

13:40.160 --> 13:45.860
Oh my god. Hey, did you guys ever put it together that Dino is also like spelled like Dino?

13:46.400 --> 13:53.040
Don't insult my intelligence and the intelligence of our many listeners cuz it's like is it so I can't wait

13:53.040 --> 13:59.240
To see this one. I did miss the last one of them and the one before that and so I wondering if I if there will

13:59.240 --> 14:07.360
Be certain things. Yeah that I will. Okay. Well my only exposure is that sometimes we go to the dinosaur park here in

14:08.080 --> 14:10.080
Austin and it is a purely

14:10.880 --> 14:15.760
These things are dead as disco. These are decorative dinos only

14:15.760 --> 14:22.800
Um, but they do have toys there from the JP franchise and it's like watch as he shares a psychic link

14:23.160 --> 14:27.660
Via Bluetooth connection with blue the velociraptor and it's like whoa

14:28.280 --> 14:35.320
There's definitely some plot losing. I would say in the first and second where um, there is okay guys

14:35.680 --> 14:37.680
There's a moment in the first one

14:37.720 --> 14:42.560
Where what they've done here and I find this quite interesting as a choice is they've said

14:42.560 --> 14:48.360
People are getting fucking bored with that. They've seen dinosaurs

14:48.360 --> 14:51.800
So what we're gonna do is invent our own dice are gonna make a different dinosaur

14:51.940 --> 14:52.440
Okay

14:52.440 --> 15:00.720
And it it what it does is invents a world in which after like a decade or so everyone's like dinosaurs fucking seen them

15:02.440 --> 15:09.680
Yeah, dude, I get it it doesn't invent that world Travis it observes the current world because if you don't think that would happen

15:09.680 --> 15:12.320
You're not paying attention, man. Yes

15:13.840 --> 15:20.760
Man, and you know what? Nobody else is either. So let's do some advice question. Okay. Yeah, I think that that's what America needs right now

15:20.760 --> 15:25.600
Now we didn't plan this spec episode by the way in time to request

15:26.280 --> 15:30.320
Dinosaur themed questions. So I just pulled the questions that I thought

15:31.100 --> 15:35.940
We could maybe we could somehow tie it in. Yeah, that's part. That's so tasteful

15:35.940 --> 15:41.580
Thank you. Yeah, a lot of people are so sweaty in these in these sponsored things

15:41.580 --> 15:45.780
They're like so desperate to like say the brand over and over again. Yeah, and we may as well

15:45.780 --> 15:52.620
We may not mention we might not mention it again, right? This year. I'm gonna be working at a camp for most of the summer

15:52.620 --> 15:58.660
I'm super excited and this be fine. Except my birthday is also in the summer. I will be turning 17 if you were curious

15:58.660 --> 16:03.700
I was I am NOT a big birthday person in general preferring to do something smaller with my friends

16:03.700 --> 16:07.900
And I do not want to celebrate my birthday with people. I don't know. Well, the issue is I have some friends

16:07.900 --> 16:10.620
They're also working there. I'm not sure if they know when my birthday is

16:10.620 --> 16:14.700
I don't want to tell them the other staff, but I also don't ask them directly in

16:15.260 --> 16:19.260
Case they don't know and then slip up later, but brothers, what should I do?

16:20.980 --> 16:22.900
Hmm, yeah

16:22.900 --> 16:27.780
Or you guys see the catch here, right? You guys see the problem, right? Distill it for me. Dr

16:27.780 --> 16:31.900
Grant if you go to your friends and say like hey

16:31.900 --> 16:38.820
Do you are you guys like do you know when my birthday is right? Like so loaded? Absolutely

16:39.980 --> 16:45.180
Do not that's what I'm saying that to any human being ever in your life. You cannot cannot be done

16:45.820 --> 16:47.900
Because just by introducing that

16:48.700 --> 16:52.180
Right, there is no like if they're like no

16:52.180 --> 17:01.680
No, why and you're like don't worry about it. Oh god, that would be so brutal. Oh, oh

17:02.440 --> 17:06.000
Right, this one is actually tough a lot of these are easy

17:06.000 --> 17:10.620
But this one's tough cuz what if they like what if you walk in to the egg hall?

17:12.960 --> 17:14.960
And they have all of the

17:15.440 --> 17:17.080
kids with

17:17.080 --> 17:24.540
Special powers. I'm assuming that's the kind of camp it is. Yeah. Why else would anyone go to camp talents and gifts that they have to be

17:25.600 --> 17:28.840
Honing like what if you go into the egg hall and they're like

17:30.280 --> 17:35.560
Singing you're like they they're like here they are and then they sing happy birthday to you

17:36.920 --> 17:42.380
Or you're like right in the middle of like running like, you know a training exercise in the danger room

17:42.380 --> 17:49.120
And then they're like, what's this? Oh, no, it's the birthday cake monster. And you're like, oh no, man

17:49.120 --> 17:51.820
This is so embarrassing and in front of Wolverine. Oh

17:52.880 --> 17:58.560
Well, yeah, I don't think it's X-Men. That's a that's a comic. That's like a cartoon

17:58.560 --> 18:01.560
Well, it's also a good point Griffin because it's a school and not a camp

18:01.680 --> 18:06.360
Yeah, that's a good point because like they're not working. Yes. You have do you think?

18:07.120 --> 18:10.440
Do you think professor Charles Xavier's school for gifted children?

18:10.440 --> 18:12.440
You think they had like?

18:13.320 --> 18:20.960
Field trips to Heinrichs like oh, yeah got to go to cosine and do all the things like did they get to go to Kings

18:20.960 --> 18:25.500
Island and today we're gonna go to the dairy farm to figure out how you milk cows. Exactly

18:26.240 --> 18:29.480
I can shoot like spikes out of my hands

18:30.760 --> 18:33.160
While we're milking the cows, it'll make all the milk come out

18:33.160 --> 18:39.720
Think that a professor Charles Xavier school for gifted children did they have like algebra? I

18:40.440 --> 18:42.440
mean interesting like

18:42.440 --> 18:48.280
Wait, I don't you have to cut something. Yeah to have time for the danger room

18:49.880 --> 18:53.960
It's got to be home economics though, like, you know those kids, you know

18:53.960 --> 18:58.280
Ice man walks out with his fucking diploma and they're like, okay, that'll be

18:58.280 --> 19:05.680
$1,500 for the diploma and your robes and we will take a check and he's like I do not know

19:06.360 --> 19:07.680
how to

19:07.680 --> 19:09.360
Do a check

19:09.360 --> 19:11.920
But this one is like that. There's a teacher there

19:15.360 --> 19:19.800
It gets a small rip in this costume you see I just

19:21.680 --> 19:23.680
Yeah, I don't know what to do

19:23.680 --> 19:29.880
Done for it. I'm sorry. I need a new where do you get more of these? But that implies that there's nothing to be done

19:29.880 --> 19:35.220
There's a moment as a teacher's lounge right where it's just like here's you know Emma Frost and she's like yesterday

19:35.280 --> 19:40.440
We taught the students how to you know, fight the Sentinels or whatever and then like there's like, you know

19:41.280 --> 19:47.280
Teacher, mr. Like Stevens who's like, yeah, and I got this kid. He's not doing great in math

19:47.280 --> 19:52.960
Or but what did you say about Sentinels? What's your class? Yeah, that sounds good

19:52.960 --> 20:00.680
Do you think it's just sitting in the audience at Hamilton like this is fucking what kind of twisted mind thought up?

20:00.680 --> 20:02.680
all these crazy characters

20:05.920 --> 20:08.920
I'm pretty sure I said jubilee. I don't think I said

20:12.520 --> 20:16.880
Save your school for gifted children. Thank you. Did they get like Christmas break?

20:16.880 --> 20:19.280
I'm like summer break and shit

20:19.280 --> 20:24.320
No, that wouldn't make any sense that your parents a lot of those kids didn't come from great environments

20:24.320 --> 20:26.040
They don't want to go home for Christmas. Yeah, buddy

20:26.040 --> 20:31.500
But like if my kids like oh, yeah BB has powers and she can like, you know make machines do her better

20:31.500 --> 20:36.240
I'm like awesome. Oh, yeah. She's got to go to this special school. Cool. Cool. When do I get to see her? Oh

20:37.880 --> 20:44.320
She's gotta fight the Sentinels excuse me my kid my kids gotta fight the fucking Sentinels. Yeah

20:44.320 --> 20:49.920
Well, that's how else do you want him to learn how to make it in this crate this cuckoo all of ours

20:49.920 --> 20:56.080
And you guys are also gonna teach stuff about like taxes and like how a bill becomes a law and stuff, right?

20:56.280 --> 21:02.760
Well for sure sort of yeah, actually very close to that on Friday's the teachers get a half day

21:02.760 --> 21:06.420
Uh-huh to go kill Magneto. So they're gonna watch mr. Holland's opus

21:06.760 --> 21:09.280
So it's kind of that I guess

21:09.280 --> 21:16.680
Okay, one of those fucking fighting Magneto Magneto is like what's that terrible smell and it's like oh I have us

21:16.680 --> 21:21.040
I have this weird hot stink that comes out of my

21:21.760 --> 21:23.560
armpit hair I

21:23.560 --> 21:26.120
have a hot stink that comes out of my armpit hair and

21:27.400 --> 21:31.680
Yeah, and it's why it's like crazy man. It's like so

21:31.680 --> 21:38.760
That kid like he get he goes to senior year and then he's the all everyone's like

21:38.880 --> 21:45.420
So here's your costumes with big exes on them and then this to Jake is like, so where's they're like, here you go

21:45.420 --> 21:52.040
Jake is what's this is your diploma you graduated. See you later. There's gotta be good luck

21:52.040 --> 21:56.900
There's got to be someone who just discusses in a comic book, but I've never thought about it before that

21:56.900 --> 22:03.080
There's like when they graduate. It's like hey, listen, you didn't make the team and you're also

22:03.720 --> 22:09.040
Not even Alpha Flight Canada. You're not like cut out to be like a teacher here. So

22:09.640 --> 22:12.840
You're you you're done. I was like, what do I do?

22:13.960 --> 22:20.360
What do I do now? Well, my suggestion my first would be to get your GED because you do not have a comparable

22:20.360 --> 22:25.080
Not accredited you've basically been

22:25.960 --> 22:30.760
Legally truant the last eight years. So there's gonna be some issues here

22:31.400 --> 22:37.240
Also, we will be sending a bill to your parents because like we kind of fed you and did stuff for you for like eight

22:37.240 --> 22:39.240
Years and now like you're not

22:39.800 --> 22:41.800
Part of the team or whatever. So

22:42.560 --> 22:45.480
So tired of giving away all these great free ideas

22:45.480 --> 22:51.360
I know and I also worry that we're getting a little too like like into the nerdy stuff. Yeah

22:51.360 --> 22:56.360
Let's get back to the dinosaur stuff, right? Yeah, these big beautiful beat now. Here's another question

22:56.360 --> 23:02.320
Oh Griffin, you got something speaking of nerds. Here comes a wizard and I can call him that cuz we're friends cool

23:02.320 --> 23:05.000
I'm glad you guys have grown so close by the way

23:05.560 --> 23:11.360
Yeah, we're like real road road boys. So Adrian cowl sent this in

23:11.360 --> 23:16.760
Thank you, Adrian. Nice to have you back in the fold. It's how to act like a Furby. Oh

23:18.160 --> 23:25.560
Furbies a fun toy for kids and well and is fun to act like they change their whole outlook on life often and are always

23:25.560 --> 23:30.440
Hungry, if you're a huge Furby fan acting like a Furby can be a lot of fun. Oh

23:31.160 --> 23:37.520
Yeah, we're of an age to remember the the Furby craze our Furbys fun

23:37.520 --> 23:42.720
Sure. Yeah, how in what way? I talk to each other. They do

23:43.640 --> 23:48.760
How's that fun? Like why are you being so judge here? No, I'm thinking about this. I'm not trying to be judgy

23:48.880 --> 23:54.280
I'm trying to think about there are toys that do I I just bought BB and dot a marble run

23:54.800 --> 23:57.440
Fucking fun for days, right a

23:58.280 --> 24:03.480
Furby, I'm just not sure what service is providing as far as fun goes listen to you

24:03.480 --> 24:10.120
yeah, I say that sentence out loud again and then think about what how you're saying it about this the service that the fun child's

24:10.120 --> 24:12.120
toy that talks and sounds like a

24:17.960 --> 24:19.960
You're ruining the fucking mood

24:20.400 --> 24:24.800
Wow, okay, please go on. I'm willing to open my mind up to the fact that

24:25.640 --> 24:27.640
Maybe a Furby is in some way

24:27.640 --> 24:35.000
Fun. Yeah. Okay. All right. Creep. All right. Thank you. Sorry such a gosh dang. So sorry

24:35.600 --> 24:38.640
I'm just saying guys. I just don't see what it does. Okay, it's fine

24:39.360 --> 24:42.280
What does it have to do? What is a marble run to do?

24:43.480 --> 24:46.880
Marbles in it and I want you to do things a Furby demands my attention

24:47.400 --> 24:51.840
It's not gonna fucking rub my feet at the end of the day. So it's a shitty toy

24:51.840 --> 24:57.960
Oh, yeah, it's not a cookie. It's not gonna cook me my my ham at the end of the day

24:57.960 --> 25:03.560
So what's the fucking point of it? It's not making me money. That's for sure. Just I'm so sorry about all this Griffin

25:03.560 --> 25:07.040
Can you just go try to did to carry on? I don't know that I fucking can

25:08.460 --> 25:13.960
Looking the part decide what color Furby you are they vary in color from white black orange pink blue and even yellow

25:14.440 --> 25:20.660
Choose the color you like best cool. I think I'm gonna go yellow. Okay, you don't even like them

25:20.660 --> 25:25.200
You don't like you don't get to say that you don't even get to do pretends. Oh my god

25:25.480 --> 25:28.080
Justin's I'm just saying that a Furby is an

25:28.280 --> 25:32.920
Electronic version of a bag of flour given to a kid in health class to learn about responsibility

25:33.760 --> 25:34.880
Okay

25:34.880 --> 25:39.240
Marbles just rocks and ramps. Yeah. Yeah, that's awesome, dude

25:39.240 --> 25:44.680
We're just listen to cool things where furry clothing according to the color you picked for example

25:44.680 --> 25:49.440
If you are a blue Furby where blue furry clothing with no texture designs on it

25:49.440 --> 25:51.200
Wow

25:51.200 --> 25:58.580
Sanication go barefoot Furby's dread shoes. So when I can't Furby's dread shoes

25:58.880 --> 26:00.880
so whenever you

26:02.340 --> 26:05.840
Go barefoot whenever you can in the summer wear flip-flops a lot. Um

26:06.860 --> 26:08.860
Okay, but you just said

26:09.620 --> 26:15.340
Here's here's another thing. Don't wear makeup and jewelry a Furby would never wear these things Furby baby

26:15.340 --> 26:19.920
I like you just natural you don't have to try like the other take your makeup off

26:19.920 --> 26:24.200
Take your shoes off put some makeup off your Furby now

26:24.600 --> 26:29.820
But do wear a realistic pair of ears that are the color of your Furby

26:30.200 --> 26:33.400
Purchase a realistic has some text. That's busted

26:34.120 --> 26:38.000
Purchase a realistic tail to wear them every day. Do not sleep in them

26:38.720 --> 26:43.600
Wait, don't sleep in her Furby can't take off his fur. We can't rip off its ears and tail

26:43.600 --> 26:45.600
Catch your sleep

26:47.880 --> 26:49.600
They'll grow back

26:49.600 --> 26:51.600
They always do

26:52.320 --> 26:54.040
Free me

26:54.040 --> 26:58.120
Change your personality according to what is happening in life pretty sure

26:58.680 --> 27:03.720
We're all doing that all the time. That's automatic. Actually. Yeah, that's actually how

27:04.760 --> 27:11.600
Being works. Yeah, how do we know Furby's don't like makeup and jewelry is that maybe we've just never offered that

27:11.600 --> 27:14.140
Maybe we've never tried to doll up

27:15.080 --> 27:17.080
Tart up boy

27:18.000 --> 27:20.800
Tart up one of these for turn up these beautiful boys

27:21.040 --> 27:27.680
Sorry, my Furby tart this Furby for me, please if everything is going well with your family and friends and life is great

27:27.680 --> 27:32.240
Be social kind and caring if someone angers you or makes you mad or life is pretty sad for you

27:32.240 --> 27:34.240
Be grouchy if you're away from crowds

27:34.600 --> 27:41.200
Check check checks across the board. Yeah, I've got this covered actually. I'm actually already being a Furby all the time

27:41.200 --> 27:47.280
What's this copied and pasted from maybe a different wiki how article? Yeah, I can just use that here

27:48.600 --> 27:54.080
It's applicable when someone pulls their steps on your tail do something according to your personality

27:54.080 --> 27:57.700
If you are in the loving one gig if you are in the loving one

27:57.920 --> 28:03.280
Giggle if you are in the grouchy one glare if you are the dancer girl boy go out

28:03.400 --> 28:06.520
Dude, if you are the sassy type roll your eyes

28:06.520 --> 28:13.680
That is what happens when someone pulls my butt now just as a human some pulls my butt and if I'm in a loving mood

28:13.680 --> 28:14.680
I'm like

28:14.680 --> 28:21.440
And when I'm in a dancer girl or guy mood, I guess sure. Yeah, I was on the street dancing the other day

28:21.440 --> 28:26.760
So we grabbed both cheeks and pulled as hard as they could. Oh, man. I'm sorry, and I I was my mistake

28:26.760 --> 28:30.960
So I was like, hey, I didn't say how dude cuz I was in dancer mode

28:30.960 --> 28:35.480
And so if I I'm not allowed to be a Furby anymore eat a lot

28:35.480 --> 28:41.680
Furbies get hungry frequently. Don't stuff yourself. Never overeat or put yourself at risk for diabetes

28:43.160 --> 28:45.160
What?

28:45.160 --> 28:50.120
Thanks took a strange turn. Thanks wiki how article

28:51.080 --> 28:57.560
Just eat whenever you feel hungry and eat a variety of anything. You like love desserts and sweet treats eat dessert a lot

28:58.160 --> 28:59.440
What?

28:59.440 --> 29:04.280
Wait, this is part of being a Furby. Yeah, man. Eat a lot, but don't eat a lot

29:04.280 --> 29:10.520
It's hey Jeremy. I was looking at your first draft of this wiki how article you wrote about how to be a Furby

29:11.200 --> 29:12.200
What do you think?

29:12.200 --> 29:14.840
Sir, I'm sorry, sir. Yeah, I only I only wrote in

29:15.400 --> 29:21.880
30 or 40 pages of nutritional. This is mainly an article about nutrition that I've briefly mentioned the Furby's at the beginning

29:21.880 --> 29:22.680
Are you yeah? Yeah

29:22.680 --> 29:22.920
No

29:22.920 --> 29:29.520
I'm thinking maybe expand to the Furby aspect of this and maybe include something about how to react when someone's mean to you

29:29.640 --> 29:33.200
Might be useful to I mean just a general reader, right?

29:33.200 --> 29:41.160
Through the focus groups and we definitely need way less nutrition stuff way more stuff about how if someone pulls your butt you go

29:41.160 --> 29:41.800
Ow, dude

29:41.800 --> 29:42.320
Yeah

29:42.320 --> 29:48.800
And maybe change the title from like how to eat healthy and like have the energy you need to accomplish things throughout the day

29:48.800 --> 29:51.240
Maybe change that to be like how to be a Furby. I

29:52.280 --> 29:58.000
Don't actually know I've never actually seen a Furby. Is that a problem or no, I've pulled up

29:58.720 --> 30:02.920
Several tabs on my computer just like all the time just in case you had asked about it

30:02.920 --> 30:05.520
Your computer's smoking. Is that it's a lot of tabs

30:06.080 --> 30:10.840
So if you want to come check them out, they've been up for a while. So there's some burn-in on the screen

30:17.120 --> 30:23.160
You gotta hold it because that's the sacrifice you make for Furby's now, let me pull your ears and tail off

30:24.280 --> 30:26.680
That's weird. They won't come off. I'll just pull harder

30:26.680 --> 30:33.680
Ah, okay now go back and write and don't let this happen again. Oh, no, my wife's probably gonna come downstairs now

30:33.680 --> 30:36.920
I'm gonna say that I cut my finger off over the mitre. Yeah, that's fair

30:38.320 --> 30:40.080
Sleep a lot

30:40.080 --> 30:42.480
I'm doing again. I'm

30:43.560 --> 30:44.960
Life, huh?

30:44.960 --> 30:49.840
Furbies get tired easily take one or two naps during the day and have an earlier bedtime than others sleep in as long as you

30:49.840 --> 30:54.920
Like there is what sleep in as long as you like as long as there is no school if it is a school day

30:54.920 --> 30:59.280
Wake up on time. Yes. No, did you add that? No, no, it says that

31:01.040 --> 31:04.760
It doesn't say keep your grades up, but I think it's implied there it's implied

31:05.680 --> 31:07.680
Hey, check this out. Love music

31:08.480 --> 31:09.840
Okay

31:09.840 --> 31:16.520
Love music dance to music and have fun. Don't forget to change into a dancer's girl slash boy. What music is okay guys

31:16.520 --> 31:21.920
Here's what I'm starting to learn that I was wrong at the beginning because apparently a Furby is very useful to teach us how

31:21.920 --> 31:23.920
To be more human

31:23.920 --> 31:26.600
Right. He's teaching us like what someone makes you mad

31:26.600 --> 31:31.280
It's okay to be mad and when you're hungry, you should eat don't get nine beauties and like you're tired

31:31.280 --> 31:35.160
You should sleep man. And when music comes on fucking dance like nobody's watching

31:37.400 --> 31:44.360
It's so wild that they felt they had to clarify you should not eat to a point where it's detrimental to your health

31:45.060 --> 31:51.840
Why did we have to clarify that for this? I'm not sure I trust the wiki how Furby article to

Let me tell you about Bombas's mission

35:46.000 --> 35:49.200
Justin can you give me some mission music? They're mission

35:49.200 --> 35:51.040
Oh

35:51.040 --> 35:55.960
No, that's not it. Can you give me something else? That's the only music I have. Okay. Well just any sounds there

35:55.960 --> 36:02.800
They got a mission. No, I made it quieter. No, give me something more intense. You're making intense doesn't have to be music

36:03.360 --> 36:05.360
Sure

36:06.240 --> 36:08.240
Their mission

36:10.880 --> 36:18.800
Okay, their mission is to make the most comfortable clothes ever and match every item sold with an equal item donated

36:18.800 --> 36:22.560
So when you buy Bombas you are also giving to someone in need

36:23.360 --> 36:24.640
Pretty cool

36:24.640 --> 36:25.400
Pretty cool

36:25.400 --> 36:30.000
If you ask me plus they've designed their socks shirts and underwear to be the clothes

36:30.000 --> 36:34.640
You can't wait to put on every day. That is true. I just bought myself. That's right

36:34.640 --> 36:39.800
But I didn't wait for Bombas to send me so I bought it underpants and I love them

36:40.400 --> 36:43.520
They're comfortable and they make my junk look great

36:43.520 --> 36:49.280
Come on that business load Lulu. It does make Lulu down there

36:50.240 --> 36:55.880
Everything they make it soft seamless tagless and has a cozy feel and clothesless

36:58.680 --> 37:05.200
Yeah, it's like wearing nothing and everyone's like hey, I love I can't participate in this scam anymore Bombas since you

37:06.320 --> 37:11.200
Sorry, you gotta find out like this and there's a note card and it says looking good, baby

37:11.200 --> 37:18.000
And it's like Bombas. You don't know me like that when they sell no-show socks. They literally literally

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
They don't show up in the box

37:21.000 --> 37:27.600
I can't believe but all this is the thing all the clothes they sell get donated even the stuff

37:27.600 --> 37:29.600
You're like, but I was gonna wear that

37:29.680 --> 37:32.960
Tough should we say now that these are jokes?

37:33.520 --> 37:37.920
These are these are jokes. They do send you things for you to put on your body

37:37.920 --> 37:43.040
We know Griffin you can't wink you can't win

37:43.040 --> 37:46.960
All right, cuz I'm kind of undermined. Okay good thing. They really think clothes

37:49.920 --> 37:51.920
Serious

37:53.040 --> 37:55.040
They really

37:57.560 --> 38:01.580
That's still bad don't they definitely don't not send clothes

38:01.580 --> 38:07.360

Hey, it's John Moe join me on depression mode for conversations on how mental health shapes our life this week

38:41.540 --> 38:47.580
David Sedaris with stories of his late father that he's finally willing to tell I think there's a

38:48.180 --> 38:54.340
Difference between you know a good person and a good character like he was a good character

38:54.340 --> 38:58.700
My boyfriend here and my father was another one of those people. He was a really good character

38:58.700 --> 39:00.980
But he wasn't a good person

39:01.780 --> 39:04.980
Depressed mode with John Moe wherever you get your podcasts

39:10.960 --> 39:12.960
Can we please do the second question

39:12.960 --> 39:17.960
Oh

39:19.760 --> 39:24.200
Hey, welcome to our new segment building a mystery. Oh, okay. All right

39:25.240 --> 39:30.520
You guys are gonna love this as children. We were all raised on encyclopedia brown books

39:30.880 --> 39:32.720
This is a book if you're not familiar

39:32.720 --> 39:37.200
This is about a young boy and his friend Sally and how they solve mysteries together

39:37.200 --> 39:44.720
And it's like he's a genius to the point where the cops often consult like an 11 year old child in a crime in Ida Ville

39:45.240 --> 39:48.520
For over a year. This is where encyclopedia brown lives

39:48.660 --> 39:54.200
So we were raised on these books and I've been getting my daughter Charlie into the books as well

39:54.360 --> 39:58.460
It's fun. You listen to them and then you try to solve the mystery

39:58.880 --> 40:04.000
You know at the end just like encyclopedia does it's fun. It's good problem-solving. They're great

40:04.000 --> 40:08.760
I assume they're available at scholastic book fair still you can find them anywhere fine books are sold

40:08.760 --> 40:14.280
There are however, I have to say Donald J. Sobel the author of this franchise wrote a lot of these

40:14.280 --> 40:19.440
Oh, yeah, and he had let's call it a gift for metaphor. Sure. And

40:20.320 --> 40:28.260
What I what we're gonna be doing in this brand new segment is we're gonna be checking out some of mr. Sobel's

40:29.280 --> 40:31.280
absolutely bananas

40:31.280 --> 40:36.080
Metaphors and you are gonna try to guess this is a quiz show. Oh, okay

40:36.080 --> 40:40.900
You are gonna try to guess how these these absolute bangers

40:41.840 --> 40:47.120
Complete so I'm gonna give you the first half. Okay, and then you have to guess the second half

40:48.200 --> 40:49.960
Are you ready, please?

40:49.960 --> 40:56.920
We're going to begin with encyclopedia Brown saves the day not the first book chronologically, but it was the one that we were listening to

40:56.920 --> 41:01.120
When when I thought of this series and in fact

41:01.120 --> 41:06.360
It was this first question that prompted me down this rabbit hole that was so much deeper than I thought it would be

41:06.660 --> 41:10.920
Here we go Bugs Meanie. That's the bully of I mean this guy's a master

41:11.560 --> 41:17.960
This he's real fucked up. He's so fucked up. He's like twist. He's basically the joke

41:17.960 --> 41:25.960
Yeah, yeah, thank you Travis vector the Joker up unless it's bugs bugs Meanie was the leader of a gang of wild

41:25.960 --> 41:31.480
Older boys, they called them. I would actually be really good doing audiobooks for encyclopedia

41:31.480 --> 41:33.760
Oh, I thought you're gonna say as a gang of wild other boys

41:34.440 --> 41:40.420
Justin you would slot into a gang of wild older boys like a like a key into a lock

41:40.480 --> 41:44.160
This is this is our neighborhood's toughest gang. They're called the Tigers

41:44.160 --> 41:48.560
It's Bugs Meanie a bunch of other kids and a 41 year old man in a Hawaiian shirt

41:49.080 --> 41:56.480
He does a lot of the driving around and purchase buying beer. Yeah. Yeah, but he's not the leader. He isn't

41:57.880 --> 42:04.160
He answers to that he answers to that preteen Bugs Meanie, okay, he's kind of the vizier

42:06.680 --> 42:07.960
Bugs

42:07.960 --> 42:12.480
He is helping him and started at 529 to raise money for college with this cool

42:12.480 --> 42:15.440
Please please a Fendi. Let me bend your ear

42:16.280 --> 42:18.280
Please my little birds

42:27.480 --> 42:32.360
Bugs Meanie was the leader of a gang of wild older boys. They called themselves the tiger, huh?

42:32.360 --> 42:34.940
They should have called themselves the weatherman

42:36.280 --> 42:38.280
Why why?

42:38.280 --> 42:42.060
Because why complete the metaphor? Why should they have called Emily?

42:42.060 --> 42:45.340
I don't Kim. Why should they have called the time? It's I mean, it's a joke

42:45.340 --> 42:49.540
It sounds like the setup for a joke. Why should they were gonna have to tell me after I'm done

42:50.220 --> 42:55.640
Be why should they have called themselves the weatherman because they were always raining on everyone's parade

42:56.220 --> 43:03.580
Okay, fascinating Griffin. Why should they have called this gang of boy because they they are thunder because they

43:04.220 --> 43:05.220
are

43:05.220 --> 43:06.660
destructive as a

43:06.660 --> 43:14.340
Hurricane or a tornado they should have called themselves the weathermen. They never stole anything until the coast was clear, huh?

43:16.620 --> 43:18.620
More say one more

43:18.980 --> 43:23.540
Should have called themselves the weathermen. They never stole anything until the coast was clear

43:23.540 --> 43:30.900
You know how a weatherman is always looking at the horizon from the ocean and he's just like there's a storm rolling in

43:30.900 --> 43:37.160
Donald are you okay, bud? Okay. Give me another you've had your turn growled bugs

43:37.420 --> 43:41.620
he jerked a thumb over his shoulder now make like a pair of headlights and

43:42.300 --> 43:45.020
make like a pair of headlights and

43:46.900 --> 43:48.900
Go and

43:49.380 --> 43:55.500
And I don't did and damn and swerve and hit

43:55.500 --> 44:02.080
Hit the road switch off switch off click hit the road hit hit the road Travis. It's hit the road

44:02.220 --> 44:08.640
Yeah, they don't good job headlights. Don't tip it. The car hits that that's yeah, well the car hits the road

44:08.640 --> 44:15.880
No, no now now hold on to mr. Sowell's defense the light shines on the road. So you can see that's fine

44:16.180 --> 44:19.420
Benny was a good friend standing up as soon as he laid down

44:19.420 --> 44:22.500
He went to sleep and became a threat to the nation's forests

44:22.500 --> 44:24.500
Why

44:25.620 --> 44:27.620
Because he snored like a buzzsaw

44:28.820 --> 44:35.220
His snoring shook branches loose for half a mile around. All right, Donald Travis gets half a point for that

44:35.620 --> 44:42.660
Yeah, he gets half. But also I Donald mine was better. Why did you reach so far as

44:43.380 --> 44:46.620
Encyclopedia bite past the empty lot on Rock Garden Lane

44:46.620 --> 44:53.660
He saw Nathan Winslow swinging a pickaxe at top speed what the boy detective break to a halt. Hey Nathan

44:53.660 --> 44:59.820
He called what are you doing? What does it look like said Nathan? I'm digging now. Leave me alone

45:00.860 --> 45:02.860
Now, how does he now?

45:03.780 --> 45:05.500
Complete this line

45:05.500 --> 45:07.500
Now leave me alone

45:07.500 --> 45:15.580
Mm-hmm. I have to practice. What are the grunts there? What does he say? What? What could he possibly be saying there? Leave me alone? And

45:17.620 --> 45:23.860
It's like a turn of phrase yeah, it's like a turn afraid like a classic turn of phrase leave me alone

45:26.900 --> 45:28.740
You

45:28.740 --> 45:32.980
Rack a muffin we were looking for go wash an elephant or something

45:32.980 --> 45:34.980
Oh

45:35.660 --> 45:38.620
Okay, what are these books what are these books from

45:39.540 --> 45:40.980
18

45:40.980 --> 45:46.380
No, like the 1960s. Okay, so maybe that's just how kids talk back then

45:47.940 --> 45:54.600
We don't know go wash an elephant or something or something. Okay, we have one more from encyclopedia Brown saves the day

45:55.540 --> 46:00.220
Forget it said encyclopedia. The shine of gold can be worse than a close shave. Oh

46:00.220 --> 46:02.220
Oh

46:02.820 --> 46:07.460
The shine of gold can be worse than a close shave

46:08.900 --> 46:13.380
Because you can you can cut yourself on

46:15.820 --> 46:17.820
The

46:18.420 --> 46:21.620
My brain is not capable of the kind of lateral thinking

46:22.140 --> 46:26.260
That is that this that come on Travis demand use that broken brain

46:26.260 --> 46:31.020
Yeah, I know right a shine of gold can be worse than a close shave

46:35.540 --> 46:38.700
Smooth I guys made a lot of people lose their heads. Oh

46:39.660 --> 46:47.140
I don't think a lot of people have cut their whole fucking softball shape. John Donald Sobel also wrote a Sweeney Todd

46:50.420 --> 46:54.840
Two more quick ones. These are from encyclopedia Brown keeps the peace in every book

46:54.840 --> 47:01.800
They do one of these about the Tigers and then there's something mean that bugs mean he says to encyclopedia Brown this happens in every book

47:01.800 --> 47:08.140
Yeah, bugs was the leader of a gang of tough older boys who called themselves the Tigers. They should have called themselves the tea bags

47:12.040 --> 47:16.160
They should have called themselves the tea bags because they were always stirring things up

47:17.920 --> 47:19.920
Because there was always something brewing

47:19.920 --> 47:27.920
Oh damn it Travis is to Travis's leagues better at this game than I am like he's in a whole nother echelon

47:29.720 --> 47:31.720
But he didn't guess it oh I didn't

47:33.680 --> 47:39.360
Cuz they love to spoon cuz they always found themselves in hot water they were always getting in the hall

47:41.120 --> 47:43.120
Griffin really nice

47:43.560 --> 47:48.360
Last one bugs to this is bugs to encyclopedia get off the earth

47:48.360 --> 47:50.360
Wow

47:50.960 --> 47:52.160
Get off the earth

47:52.160 --> 47:58.720
He snarled upon seeing the boy detective or I'll twist your nose so far around you'll

47:59.520 --> 48:04.760
What you'll stand on the ceiling you'll smell your brain?

48:05.480 --> 48:08.200
You'll part your hair every time you sneeze

48:08.200 --> 48:13.600
That's good anyway

48:22.280 --> 48:27.760
Absolutely Justin my first crush was the young woman who played Sally Kimball

48:27.760 --> 48:31.040
Oh, yeah, dude in the encyclopedia Brown HBO show so tough

48:31.800 --> 48:33.280
She was so tough embrace

48:33.280 --> 48:38.800
Hey, so when I asked you during the ad break to play some mysterious music brother anything you're like this

48:38.800 --> 48:41.880
Yeah, I know trap. It was the button was right there. You fucking lied to me

48:41.880 --> 48:47.360
That's really no, but if I had burned that early then it would be like you just had that lying around

48:49.720 --> 48:53.280
Specials also, I don't want Sarah to come after me. Yeah, yeah

48:54.280 --> 48:56.280
Puppies you don't have any love for the G man

48:57.480 --> 48:58.840
publicly

48:58.840 --> 49:05.240
Here we have a second please Christ. I've been waiting my partner and I recently purchased our first home in a small rural town

49:05.920 --> 49:13.100
One of the bedrooms in our house has two very large murals of monster trucks floor to ceiling and the word

49:13.600 --> 49:19.180
Bigfoot painted on the wall. Yeah, every single one of our new neighbors has joyfully brought up these monster trucks in conversation

49:19.180 --> 49:21.160
The problem is we're not monster truck folks

49:21.160 --> 49:26.720
I and you not know who or what monster truck Bigfoot is if you don't out point of order

49:26.720 --> 49:33.920
Yeah, if you don't know who Bigfoot is you do not know who literally any monster truck. Yeah, right?

49:33.920 --> 49:35.920
Yeah, that is the I mean

49:36.560 --> 49:38.560
You might know

49:38.880 --> 49:43.880
But that's not even a monster. No, it's a robot that needs a showpiece somewhere than anything

49:43.880 --> 49:46.360
It is not it does not participate in the event

49:46.360 --> 49:52.200
It's also you have you have large pictures of monster trucks painted on the wall

49:52.200 --> 49:57.720
And you know that Bigfoot is a monster truck. You cannot say you don't know who or what?

49:58.400 --> 50:02.960
Bigfoot is it's a big monster truck called Bigfoot. It doesn't have

50:04.200 --> 50:06.200
personality traits that

50:06.680 --> 50:12.840
Differentiate it from other monster trucks. It's the first monster truck. I'm looking here

50:13.000 --> 50:19.520
It was it it was a 1974 Ford f250 pickup those modified by its owner

50:19.520 --> 50:25.120
Bob Chandler beginning in 1975 by 1979 the modifications were so extensive

50:25.120 --> 50:29.020
The truck came to be regarded as the first monster truck

50:30.040 --> 50:37.540
Bigfoot Bigfoot Bigfoot had like a cartoon show like Bigfoot's Bigfoot's the blue one on the wall that you have

50:39.080 --> 50:41.980
Okay, so anyway this person this question asker

50:42.640 --> 50:46.400
How do we respond to all these Bigfoot compliments from our new neighbors?

50:46.400 --> 50:52.320
Are we allowed to paint over these regional treasure murals in our new home? Do we lean into the monster truck honorific?

50:52.320 --> 50:55.120
That's from rurally remarkable in Cumberland, Canada

50:55.920 --> 51:01.180
Yeah, I mean, I'll never forget like do what you want. I'll never forgive you

51:01.760 --> 51:07.200
Do you know what? I mean? Like you can paint over the word Bigfoot. That's fine. That's just it's this we have pictures here

51:07.200 --> 51:13.520
it's a small like font treatment whatever paint over that right because it's not even close to the two pictures of the

51:13.520 --> 51:15.520
Fucking yeah, it's like

51:16.200 --> 51:21.680
By a window to write so it could just be like unrelated like this is actually about the monster Bigfoot

51:21.680 --> 51:26.580
I love him his big in cat in cast cradle Kurt Vonnegut writes as Boccanon says

51:26.840 --> 51:31.640
peculiar travel suggestions are dancing listens from God Wow, I would extend that

51:32.480 --> 51:36.600
To Bigfoot's on your wall. This is the universe

51:37.320 --> 51:39.200
Trying to show you

51:39.200 --> 51:46.360
That this is part of your life now like you you this is part of your life. These floors by the way are

51:47.040 --> 51:53.320
Fucking divine. Yeah, I would not risk painting these walls just because I want to ruin these beautiful floors. Holy crap

51:53.320 --> 51:58.360
Yeah, these murals by the way, these are not big heads. You may end your home be thinking. These are fat

51:58.360 --> 52:04.560
These are painted these are painted by somebody tasteful and there's like a perspective. Oh, yeah

52:04.560 --> 52:09.080
Yeah, there's one where like Bigfoot is leaping. It's that one by the way

52:09.640 --> 52:11.040
looks

52:11.040 --> 52:14.200
Three-dimensional the detail in it is incredible

52:14.200 --> 52:21.600
Now what I will say I can see where that front view monster truck is a little much

52:22.200 --> 52:27.120
It's that one's almost if I could say weirdly it's kind of it is kind of suggest

52:27.120 --> 52:32.640
Yeah, and the room just looking at the dimensions it I would say maybe 10 by 10

52:32.640 --> 52:38.760
there is a lot of there's a lot of mural in this space I

52:39.040 --> 52:41.800
would grant you that I think I

52:42.600 --> 52:49.760
Think the text of Bigfoot is a sticker. I think you think I don't think that that's actually yeah

52:49.760 --> 52:53.280
You can get that off don't you could take that off you could paint over that

52:53.280 --> 52:58.560
I don't think that would be a crime against humanity if you did anything. Oh, wait a minute

52:58.560 --> 53:05.420
Okay, enhance enhance a man Victoria zoom in. I think I can make out an artist's name Victoria enhance, please

53:06.540 --> 53:08.540
enhance

53:09.620 --> 53:17.060
Are you able to make it out where is it in the in the corner under the wheel under the wheel on the left wheel?

53:17.420 --> 53:19.420
near the outlet

53:19.580 --> 53:20.700
real

53:20.700 --> 53:23.860
You know the outlet. Oh god. Yes. I

53:23.860 --> 53:29.060
I don't see it, but I'm seeing them mark. Look right look below the outlet. Oh, yes

53:29.060 --> 53:32.860
Yes, okay over there on the one on the wall. Okay. Hold on

53:33.860 --> 53:35.860
I believe I don't know that is

53:36.980 --> 53:38.940
Marky mama toto

53:38.940 --> 53:44.180
It does seem like those letters are in there. Marky. It's Marky mama toto. I

53:44.780 --> 53:49.620
Don't think mama popo Marky mama popo. It could be it look

53:49.620 --> 53:54.820
I'm people are thinking we're having a laugh here if this looks like any name. It's Marky mama toto

53:54.820 --> 54:02.320
I'm a popo. I'm more mama popo. I'm our popo. Anyway, I would anyway, you can't know you

54:03.260 --> 54:05.260
Absolutely can in no reality

54:05.900 --> 54:09.220
Or any other paint over these big beautiful big?

54:10.300 --> 54:17.620
Let's rank them right you can paint over the word. That's solid. Yeah, I can see where you can justify

54:17.620 --> 54:22.140
Painting over the red truck at the front of the rim. Yes. Here's the justification

54:22.260 --> 54:29.180
I'm a monster and I have you can see where it's like it's bearing down on you and friends now

54:29.180 --> 54:33.700
You could also that can make position a hell of an entertainment center there. Yeah, it's a tone

54:33.700 --> 54:34.900
or a

54:34.900 --> 54:40.020
Headboard for your bed because then you could be like who's in like for like sexual stuff

54:40.020 --> 54:45.220
You could be like, yeah, who's in but then I would want it the bed facing that but it's not important

54:45.220 --> 54:51.220
but the Bigfoot on the wall the ramping jumping beauty if you

54:51.780 --> 54:57.260
Touch it with your fingers, right? You're gonna get oils on it that are gonna it belongs in

54:58.340 --> 55:01.980
Belongs it belongs in a museum. You're gonna which means that you have to make your house a museum

55:02.460 --> 55:05.460
And I'm sorry this part of your home doesn't belong to you anymore

55:05.460 --> 55:09.460
It belongs to all of us and I hate to do like imminent domain

55:09.460 --> 55:13.140
Yeah, but I do think that I'm doing I'm oh my gosh

55:13.140 --> 55:19.020
I never thought I'd be able to do this on a podcast but in my powers as a notary public. I am

55:19.820 --> 55:26.020
Declaring this room of your home on the register of historic. Oh, wow in Cumberland. That's amazing

55:26.300 --> 55:29.220
So yeah, I and I'm I got my stamp right here

55:30.140 --> 55:34.220
Okay, this is official folks and I would never abuse this power. I take

55:34.940 --> 55:41.220
Stamps as good for Canada on it. Yeah, it says also good for one Canada Wow

55:41.220 --> 55:44.060
I don't know. You're gonna need to get a plaque first and foremost

55:44.260 --> 55:49.940
Yeah, and I'm not just talking about for the wall. You're gonna need to get a sign outside too, right Robin Mars

55:49.940 --> 55:51.220
If you're listening

55:51.220 --> 55:58.020
Any advice you can get on how the process of getting those but like home of the painting of Bigfoot?

55:58.020 --> 56:01.100
That's really good is my like suggestion, but you wouldn't

56:01.580 --> 56:07.580
Another option because this is clearly not you you don't appreciate this in the way it needs to be appreciated

56:07.580 --> 56:13.980
so you can't just take that door out and sort of drywall over the door and then in like

56:14.340 --> 56:18.900
150 years when someone else owns the house and like one of their kids throws a

56:19.500 --> 56:25.100
Hammer or something and it like smashes into the drywall and they'll be like, hold on a second. Wait a minute

56:25.100 --> 56:26.500
I think there's a

56:26.500 --> 56:31.340
Room past there or maybe they're just looking at the house from the outside and be like there's a window there

56:31.340 --> 56:36.500
But there's no room and so they get in there and they're like what treasures are we going to find and they find two big

56:36.500 --> 56:40.120
beautiful fucking badass Bigfoot boys up there on the walls

56:41.580 --> 56:46.660
That's gonna be like a real national treasure moment for them and you can if you're gonna do that though

56:46.660 --> 56:53.220
I think you got to go one step further and leave like in the dead center of the room like one like forward key. Oh

56:54.100 --> 56:56.100
They're like what?

56:56.220 --> 57:01.220
And a note that just says find it. Yeah, find me here find me

57:01.220 --> 57:06.300
I need to hear from you know, I'm gonna reach out to Justin McElroy in Canada in Canada

57:06.300 --> 57:10.260
Canadian Justin McElroy, I feel like would be my best point of contact here

57:10.260 --> 57:12.100
I'm also gonna reach out to the village of Cumberland itself

57:12.100 --> 57:16.340
Yeah to see the process of getting a house added to the historic registry

57:16.340 --> 57:21.200
Yeah, and let me cuz I will do I question asker. Thank you so much for your support. I will do anything

57:22.120 --> 57:23.940
Yeah, I

57:23.940 --> 57:30.540
Will swear no expense spread no expense. Hey, I will also say this Justin. I'm actually willing to go one step further

57:31.260 --> 57:35.740
Um, I not only do I want this room registered and protected for all of time

57:35.740 --> 57:40.340
I think you have been gifted the opportunity to this is a hobby now, right?

57:40.420 --> 57:44.820
Because sometimes you're like is it too late in life to start a collection? Is it too late in life?

57:44.820 --> 57:49.100
Do I care enough about this thing to like spend my time doing it?

57:49.100 --> 57:55.420
This decision has been made for you. You chose to buy a house with a Bigfoot room in it. You knew it was there

57:55.420 --> 57:57.300
It's not like they cleverly

57:57.300 --> 58:00.700
Hid that from you as they showed you this room, you know, it's there

58:00.700 --> 58:07.560
So now it's time to start buying up all of the historical Bigfoot merchandise. You can find one last thing question asker

58:08.260 --> 58:13.460
If you can zero in on who that artist I would love to have the if it's if it's working mama popo

58:13.460 --> 58:15.860
That would be a real vindication for me

58:15.860 --> 58:22.100
I also would like to address the fact that the owners of this house probably walked into this room like this is fucking funny

58:22.100 --> 58:27.060
We got us in this into our favorite podcast. So he took some pictures sent this question and like did you send the pictures?

58:27.060 --> 58:31.340
Yeah, I did. Okay now we can paint and then they painted over all of it and now they're listening

58:31.340 --> 58:38.100
And now they're listening to the episode and they are very panicked like can we find marquee mama popo to recreate this work?

58:38.100 --> 58:41.140
Can we try and draw our own badass monster trucks on the wall?

58:41.180 --> 58:46.220
We're gonna roll up to this thing with the you know governor or whatever

58:46.500 --> 58:50.220
Ready to just sort of like take take it over and find some real

58:51.180 --> 58:55.620
Let's call it what it is shoddy shoddy craftsmanship of some busted

58:55.620 --> 59:03.140
Monster trucks that will recognize with our keen eye not the original work the brushstrokes. The brushstrokes are we're gonna need a preference, right?

59:03.140 --> 59:04.980
We're gonna need a proof of life

59:04.980 --> 59:09.140
Hold up today's newspaper next to this and take another photo, please

59:09.700 --> 59:13.220
And then just proceed to do that every day until we die

59:13.220 --> 59:16.940
I don't if you have not already regretted sending this question in your mouth

59:17.660 --> 59:21.580
Boundaries are so important and we are really cognizant of that and we have tried

59:21.580 --> 59:28.700
You know, we have really endeavored to establish those healthy boundaries between us and our audience, but this is hard fucking room now

59:28.700 --> 59:35.900
This is our room long this belongs to us now. Thank you. I thank you so much for listening to our podcast
