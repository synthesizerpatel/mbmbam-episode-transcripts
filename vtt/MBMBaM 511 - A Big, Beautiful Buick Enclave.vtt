WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:46.880
Hey, you know how we've been talking about not doing an intro?

00:47.440 --> 00:48.480
Yeah. Yeah.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.080
Stop. No, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on. I'm actually,

00:54.080 --> 00:58.320
I am, I've been editing this show for 10 fucking years without complaint.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.400
Uh-huh. I'm not going to,

01:00.400 --> 01:07.200
I simply won't allow this to happen. I'm playing the card that I feel like I am owed

01:07.760 --> 01:12.080
for that extra work and saying that this won't be a show.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.880
Yeah, I know, I know, but riddle me piss, boys.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.480
Justin, can you make, Justin, will you talk to him?

01:18.480 --> 01:20.480
My name is Justin McElroy. My brother, my brother,

01:20.480 --> 01:23.520
meets an advisor for The Mudge Manor. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:23.520 --> 01:26.160
I'm the riddle master. That's Travis.

01:26.160 --> 01:29.120
I'm the sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. And Travis, can I say something?

01:29.120 --> 01:32.960
You're obviously trying to be quiet so as not to wake up a young person.

01:32.960 --> 01:37.920
And so like, yeah, there's something even fucking worse about him.

01:37.920 --> 01:41.440
It's worse. It's worse. It's worse. It's worse.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.520
It's like he's in my ear. I hate it.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.520
Me piss needs riddled.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.640
No, that's nothing.

01:49.840 --> 01:54.080
We've never really gotten into what that title means,

01:54.080 --> 01:59.200
but does the riddle master urinate in some sort of bowl

01:59.200 --> 02:02.480
that then we're supposed to splash around? What's up with that, Trav?

02:02.480 --> 02:05.600
When you get the answer correct, I piss a little.

02:06.480 --> 02:11.120
Okay, sweet, man. Fuck yeah. Let's do it. Now I'm on board.

02:11.120 --> 02:14.080
This one was sent in by Jonathan. Thank you, Jonathan.

02:14.080 --> 02:21.120
If a chicken says all chickens are liars, is the chicken telling the truth?

02:21.120 --> 02:23.360
No. Next question.

02:24.080 --> 02:28.880
Well, I'm going to say yes. So certainly we've broken your spell, right?

02:28.880 --> 02:31.680
Because he said no and I said yes. So the spell is broken.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.920
One of the correct answers is out there.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.000
Answer, chickens cannot talk.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.560
That's actually a pretty good riddle.

02:38.560 --> 02:39.360
That's actually a good riddle.

02:39.360 --> 02:44.960
Is it? Is it? Because that seems like if you walk up to two statues

02:44.960 --> 02:47.280
and one statue says, one of us always tells the lie,

02:47.280 --> 02:48.640
one of us always tells the truth.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.160
And I'm like, oh, I think the one on the right.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.720
And you're like, no, fuck you. Statues don't talk, idiot.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.040
Yeah, bud. That's a good solution to the riddle

02:55.040 --> 02:58.000
because it's a little brain twisty. And Trav, can I say something?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.640
This bit is fucking dead and you just killed it

03:00.640 --> 03:01.840
because that was a good riddle.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.040
And now you're the asshole.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.400
Because chickens cannot talk is a good-

03:04.960 --> 03:06.080
Maybe Jonathan's the asshole.

03:06.080 --> 03:12.560
I want to call bullshit because if you say if in the riddle,

03:13.280 --> 03:19.360
you are creating a reality in which this supposition is true.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.360
If, then, right?

03:21.360 --> 03:29.120
So it would be like me saying, if my Buick got into a car crash,

03:29.120 --> 03:32.800
would it still be drivable? And then you thought about it

03:32.800 --> 03:36.960
and then I would say, the correct answer is I don't have a Buick.

03:36.960 --> 03:41.520
And it's like, okay, but we've already established the framework

03:41.520 --> 03:43.200
in which the if is true.

03:43.200 --> 03:43.840
Thank you.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.880
So the if assumes that the chicken is talking.

03:46.880 --> 03:50.800
What I should say is if a chicken says all chickens are liars,

03:50.800 --> 03:52.720
is the chicken telling the truth? Answer.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.520
Chickens cannot talk and you should probably seek help.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.840
Then what you've established is I know that you think

03:59.840 --> 04:01.840
that that chicken said all chickens are liars,

04:01.840 --> 04:04.960
but my friend, chickens cannot talk and I'm worried about you.

04:05.920 --> 04:09.760
Can I just dip in here real quick to assuage the audience's fears

04:09.760 --> 04:11.840
and concerns and say that-

04:11.840 --> 04:14.240
Well, you're going to assuage the audience's fears and concerns.

04:14.240 --> 04:18.320
I'm going to go take a nap. I'll be back in 45 minutes

04:18.320 --> 04:20.480
once you address all these concerns.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.240
Justin does have a Buick.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.280
He's always talking about his big, beautiful Buick enclave.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.080
And I know people when they said, when Justin said that,

04:30.080 --> 04:31.200
you were like, wait a minute,

04:31.200 --> 04:34.400
has he been lying about his incredible Buick enclave this whole time?

04:34.400 --> 04:38.000
And I just want you to know that was, Justin, say psych.

04:38.000 --> 04:38.400
Psych.

04:39.040 --> 04:39.600
Thank you.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.920
All of that fan art would have gone to waste.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.480
Of you riding around in your big fucking Buick,

04:44.480 --> 04:46.000
hanging out the beautiful Buick.

04:46.000 --> 04:46.560
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.960
I meant the fan art where people drew Justin

04:48.960 --> 04:51.520
as a big, beautiful Buick enclave.

04:51.520 --> 04:51.840
Oh, that's cool.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.280
Any fan art in which I am not depicted behind the wheel

04:55.280 --> 04:59.760
of my big, beautiful Buick enclave is actually non-canonical.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.160
Yeah.

05:00.160 --> 05:04.720
It is only canonical if I'm like in the Buick enclave

05:04.720 --> 05:07.040
with tunes blasting.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.080
Yeah, shit tunes.

05:08.080 --> 05:14.800
I got the pedal to the sort of halfway to the metal at a safe speed.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.400
Yeah, I saw a piece.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.040
You have a cold brew waiting for you at home

05:19.680 --> 05:21.600
where you will not be driving.

05:21.600 --> 05:25.120
And that's hard to depict of an object that is that far away.

05:25.120 --> 05:29.040
But Juice, one time on Tumblr, I saw you driving a Chevy Cruze

05:29.040 --> 05:30.160
and I reported it.

05:30.880 --> 05:34.480
I reported it and the user was promptly arrested.

05:34.480 --> 05:37.680
Yeah, I love driving my big, beautiful Buick.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.640
Yeah, we know.

05:39.920 --> 05:44.800
One thing I do is that I leave the passenger side airbag inflated

05:44.800 --> 05:47.520
so I can sleep in there because I know you want to leave it.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.360
Yeah, it's nice.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.520
Your family does miss you, by the way.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.680
My family should be a Buick if they want my affection.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.720
But Sydney called me and told me to ask you

05:56.720 --> 05:58.560
to please come inside from the garage.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.840
You've just been recording in the Buick and eating in the Buick.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.360
Well, does Sydney have a Hemi?

06:04.640 --> 06:05.680
You know, I haven't asked.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.600
Does she go honk-honk when she talk?

06:07.600 --> 06:08.320
No.

06:08.320 --> 06:08.800
No.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.440
She get 18 city, 26 highway?

06:11.440 --> 06:12.080
No.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.280
Is she a mid-sized luxury SUV?

06:15.920 --> 06:16.480
No.

06:16.480 --> 06:20.400
She's not my beautiful, beautiful Buick conclave.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.400
Travis, what would you say, just to guesstimate,

06:22.400 --> 06:24.400
Sydney's towing capacity is?

06:24.400 --> 06:26.000
Is it 1,500 pounds?

06:26.000 --> 06:26.720
Is it 1,500 pounds?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.160
Oh no, not even close, there's no way.

06:28.160 --> 06:28.400
Probably not.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.360
Maybe 1,200?

06:29.360 --> 06:29.600
Jeez.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.680
Just another way in which Sydney doesn't really measure up

06:33.680 --> 06:35.840
to the 2020 Buick enclave.

06:35.840 --> 06:39.040
I love my children, but what they don't have

06:39.040 --> 06:40.960
is a refined powertrain.

06:40.960 --> 06:41.440
That's true.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.920
That is gonna give you a gentle ride.

06:43.920 --> 06:46.800
They have very little space for cargo also.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.120
But Justin, can your Buick give you a hug?

06:50.400 --> 06:51.760
You're missing the point, Travis.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.040
You don't understand, Travis.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.360
The Buick has the smart slide second row

06:55.360 --> 06:57.440
that makes room for all the big groceries

06:57.440 --> 06:59.120
Justin buys every week.

06:59.120 --> 06:59.600
Yeah.

06:59.600 --> 07:05.920
Dude, did my kids get called by U.S. News and World Report a car?

07:05.920 --> 07:06.960
They didn't, right?

07:08.960 --> 07:10.640
So no, they're not a car.

07:10.640 --> 07:13.440
They're not my big, beautiful Buick enclave.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.480
I guess that's true.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.120
The saddest irony is I bought this big, beautiful Buick enclave

07:23.120 --> 07:25.040
to tow my family around.

07:25.040 --> 07:25.520
Right.

07:25.520 --> 07:30.480
But the Buick enclave became a found family for me.

07:30.480 --> 07:36.320
I have connected myself to it in every available pore hole

07:36.320 --> 07:42.000
and sort of orifice, a car orifice that it possesses.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.080
I am turning myself into a Matrix-like human hybrid.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.160
Now, it is not a Toyota Matrix, Justin.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.560
It is a beautiful Buick enclave.

07:52.560 --> 07:53.040
Right.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.000
That's a good point.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.480
Right, that's a good point. Thank you.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.400
So this is like in Lawn Mower Man,

07:58.400 --> 08:01.200
except instead of connecting yourself to a lawnmower,

08:01.200 --> 08:02.480
you're connecting yourself to a car.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.480
It's not a lawnmower.

08:06.480 --> 08:11.040
It's a beautiful 2020 Buick enclave.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.880
Now, what if your children asked to get in the Buick with you?

08:15.680 --> 08:18.560
Oh, there's a whole delousing process.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.040
It's like the Andromeda strain.

08:21.040 --> 08:25.600
They have to walk through a sort of antiseptic goo,

08:26.320 --> 08:27.360
wade through that.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.080
I will say about this, about the Buick enclave,

08:32.080 --> 08:36.480
the interior stains like hysterically easily.

08:36.480 --> 08:42.320
Like I sneezed in there and there's been a sort of beige spot

08:42.320 --> 08:45.600
on the passenger seat that I just cannot get rid of.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.000
If my kids want to sit in my big beautiful Buick enclave,

08:50.000 --> 08:51.520
they're going to have lots of options.

08:51.520 --> 08:55.120
There's three rows of first class seating in this back there.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.840
Yeah, with a chest, got that chestnut interior.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.000
Oh, I love that.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.520
Yeah, it's really nice.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.480
It's a beautiful, I mean, they have so many options,

09:04.480 --> 09:08.320
except the option to come into the car and sit in it.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.640
They can't sit in daddy's new wife, is I guess what I'm saying.

09:12.640 --> 09:18.560
But wife is so reductive because it's also like my father.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.480
And it's also like yourself.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.040
This car is everything to me.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:25.280 --> 09:28.000
Do you know what you can't get with a Buick enclave?

09:28.000 --> 09:28.640
What?

09:28.640 --> 09:31.280
Within six feet of me, that's what I'm saying.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.760
I don't get out of the enclave.

09:34.560 --> 09:34.880
Okay.

09:34.880 --> 09:35.600
Oh, I see.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.080
It's a large vehicle, I think.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.240
Once the dining room is reopened at McDonald's,

09:40.240 --> 09:42.960
I'm just going to drive my enclave straight into it.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.160
This is probably a bad time to mention this,

09:46.160 --> 09:47.120
but this week's episode-

09:47.120 --> 09:49.200
There's no bad time in my Buick enclave.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.240
Time has no meaning.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.680
Let me open the sunroof so I can use the included sundial

09:55.680 --> 09:57.040
to tell what time it is.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.200
And then I'll tell you if it's a bad time for this.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.120
This week's episode is sponsored by Ford.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.240
Wow, that is uncomfortable.

10:04.240 --> 10:04.480
Yeah.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.360
I guess we better start.

10:07.360 --> 10:13.360
Well, anyway, I've got this new 2016 Ford Explorer.

10:13.360 --> 10:16.000
That's really, it makes me want to barf saying good things about it.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.680
I can't do it.

10:17.680 --> 10:18.880
I can't do it.

10:18.880 --> 10:21.760
I really want to throw up.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.920
2019 Ford Fiesta.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.520
Do not throw up in the Buick.

10:26.560 --> 10:27.520
No, I would never.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.040
It's got this.

10:29.040 --> 10:32.400
I can't, guys, I can't stop talking about my beautiful car.

10:32.400 --> 10:36.480
It's got a 3.6L V6 SIDI with VVT.

10:36.480 --> 10:37.600
Whoa, whoa.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.960
I don't want to tell tales out of school,

10:40.960 --> 10:43.040
and maybe I'll have to cut this out,

10:43.040 --> 10:47.120
but I feel like if your big, beautiful Buick Enclave drove-

10:47.120 --> 10:48.160
Oh, boy.

10:48.160 --> 10:51.920
Even you saying it, it makes me happy and sad.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.360
Because get it out your mouth.

10:53.360 --> 10:58.880
Yeah, if it drove right at a 2019 Ford Fiesta,

10:58.880 --> 11:00.640
in a parking lot even, you're backing up.

11:00.640 --> 11:01.680
You're not looking where you're going.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.320
You're going to crunch one of these like a Bigfoot monster car.

11:05.520 --> 11:08.000
So this thing's a tin can.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.320
It won't protect your family like the Buick Enclave.

11:10.320 --> 11:13.520
The Buick Enclave will die for you and your family.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.800
The Buick Enclave.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.400
I'm talking about 0% APR for 84 months, guys.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.760
These things are wild.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.200
That's a steal, Justin.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.960
You're basically taking the Buick

11:22.960 --> 11:25.040
from the dealership at that point.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.800
And Justin, tell me about the curves

11:26.800 --> 11:29.040
and how they satisfy you.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.960
Oh, boy, you can get a personalized look.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.280
They got enhanced functionality and utility.

11:36.560 --> 11:39.600
There's assist steps if you want to go that route.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.040
No way.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.120
They got universal tablet holders

11:43.120 --> 11:44.640
to rear seat entertainment,

11:44.640 --> 11:48.080
all kinds of great options to keep the kids occupied.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.760
Not that my kids are allowed in it.

11:49.760 --> 11:50.260
Right.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.520
Listen, I don't want to burn myself out

11:53.520 --> 11:54.560
talking about the Buick.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.480
Because listen, we have a lot of weeks of us

11:56.480 --> 11:57.680
talking about the Buick ahead of us.

11:57.680 --> 12:01.520
They got, listen, you buy accessories

12:01.520 --> 12:02.800
for this thing online,

12:03.360 --> 12:05.120
you're going to get free ground shipping.

12:05.120 --> 12:05.680
You know why?

12:06.320 --> 12:07.920
Because everybody at Buick loves

12:07.920 --> 12:09.520
driving around in the Buick so much,

12:09.520 --> 12:11.600
they take it as a delight,

12:11.600 --> 12:13.280
as a treat to drive to West Virginia

12:13.280 --> 12:14.240
to hand deliver it.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.480
Because that's more time they get in the Buick.

12:16.480 --> 12:19.040
I will say, I know I just sponsored

12:19.040 --> 12:20.000
the idea of moving on,

12:20.000 --> 12:21.760
but I will say I love it when you buy a Buick

12:21.760 --> 12:22.800
at the Buick dealership.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.120
And every time you do, everybody celebrates

12:25.120 --> 12:26.320
because they know how happy

12:26.320 --> 12:27.680
the Buick is going to make you.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.440
Because it makes them so fucking happy too.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.200
I had a Briss the first time,

12:34.240 --> 12:35.360
a traditional Briss,

12:35.360 --> 12:37.360
the first time that I bought a Buick.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.280
And then when I came back three weeks later

12:39.280 --> 12:41.280
for another Buick, they said,

12:41.280 --> 12:42.560
it's time for another Briss.

12:42.560 --> 12:47.200
And I said, I don't know how we're going to do it twice.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.160
That's, I want the Buick for sure.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.240
They said, okay, so you do want the Buick.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.080
You can't have a Buick without the Briss.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.840
That's what I have been told.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.320
You just kind of dropped the piece of information, Justin.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.920
Do you own two big, beautiful Buick enclaves?

13:01.920 --> 13:06.880
Two in the East Wing, yes.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.760
There are two East Wing Buicks

13:09.760 --> 13:12.080
because one was lonely, okay?

13:12.080 --> 13:13.040
Yeah, of course.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.520
And I am buying them a son.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.480
So there's a third one.

13:18.480 --> 13:19.760
A Buick son, yeah.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.320
Yes, it is their adopted son.

13:22.320 --> 13:26.640
They sadly cannot reproduce independently.

13:26.640 --> 13:30.240
I have to buy a new Buick to suit their needs.

13:30.240 --> 13:33.200
So I guess just like, I'm fucking disappointed in you

13:33.200 --> 13:34.960
for saying you didn't own a Buick.

13:34.960 --> 13:37.440
How could you even joke about shit like that?

13:37.440 --> 13:40.800
Yeah, there's nothing funny about Buicks as we've proven.

13:40.800 --> 13:45.200
I just love this big, big car.

13:45.840 --> 13:49.680
So this is an advice show and we help people

13:49.680 --> 13:51.040
and here's our first question.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.920
Brothers, I am 25 years old.

13:53.920 --> 13:57.120
I have a college degree and I have never eaten a pickle.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.200
I haven't been actively avoiding pickles.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.800
I've just never gotten the urge to chow down

14:00.800 --> 14:02.560
on one of those tiny, crunchy guys.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.440
At this point, I want my first pickle experience

14:05.440 --> 14:06.640
to be something special.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.520
How should I spend it to make my first

14:09.520 --> 14:12.240
real pickle eating experience something to remember?

14:13.120 --> 14:15.520
Keep in mind, I'm allergic to peanuts,

14:16.080 --> 14:20.400
tree nuts, gluten, milk, and bees.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.200
I mean, the good news, Jimbles,

14:24.160 --> 14:26.400
the good news is that none of those things

14:26.400 --> 14:29.280
are traditional pickle components.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.720
Oh wait, they say bees.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.520
Nevermind, shit.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.920
Now I'm glad they got out ahead of those allergies

14:35.920 --> 14:37.680
because my first suggestion was obviously

14:37.680 --> 14:39.440
gonna be a milk dipped pickle.

14:39.440 --> 14:42.000
Yeah, because that is covered in nuts.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.480
Cover it, cover it in nuts.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.080
Now here's, this is a good, okay.

14:48.080 --> 14:48.960
25, right?

14:48.960 --> 14:52.400
25 years of built up pickle energy.

14:53.040 --> 14:53.680
Yeah.

14:53.680 --> 14:58.640
You don't wanna just pop open the jar,

14:58.640 --> 15:01.280
sit down at your coffee table by yourself,

15:01.280 --> 15:02.640
crunch into a Vlasic,

15:03.280 --> 15:05.600
and then just, I don't know, doing nothing, right?

15:05.600 --> 15:06.240
It could kill you.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.200
It could kill you.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.120
It could actually kill you if you do that.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.440
But I'm saying, is that really what you've been waiting

15:11.440 --> 15:14.560
25 years to do, or is it like,

15:15.840 --> 15:18.800
this moment is 25 years in the making.

15:19.680 --> 15:23.120
How are we going to make sure that you set it apart?

15:23.120 --> 15:25.760
Because listen, after this, when you have your second pickle,

15:25.760 --> 15:26.960
that can be nothing, right?

15:26.960 --> 15:28.240
Your second pickle can be like,

15:28.240 --> 15:30.080
oh, it was on the burger and I didn't even notice.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.280
But your first pickle, that's special.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.480
I wanna raise a red flag on this one

15:36.480 --> 15:38.480
just to sort of get it out there.

15:39.760 --> 15:42.400
You're allergic to peanuts, tree nuts,

15:42.400 --> 15:44.480
gluten, milk, and bees.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.520
Are you real, real sure you're allergic to pickles?

15:48.080 --> 15:50.240
How confident are you that you're not allergic

15:50.240 --> 15:51.680
to also pickles?

15:51.680 --> 15:54.000
See, I was gonna say that you might not like them,

15:54.000 --> 15:55.760
but your point is way better.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.080
Yeah, you won't like them.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.440
They're foul, but-

15:59.440 --> 15:59.940
Whoa.

16:00.800 --> 16:01.760
Sorry.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.640
Last episode, we talked a lot of mad shit about vegetables,

16:04.640 --> 16:06.320
and I was willing to let that slide.

16:06.320 --> 16:07.440
But pickles are great.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.800
Now not, oh, not whatever those sweet pieces of shit are,

16:10.800 --> 16:14.160
but a nice dill, a nice crunchy dill.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.280
Oh, that's heaven, my friends.

16:17.920 --> 16:19.440
I think one thing you could do-

16:19.440 --> 16:20.480
Griffin, settle it.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.560
Make a ruling that we all have to abide by.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.160
About whether or not pickles are good?

16:24.160 --> 16:24.560
Yeah.

16:24.560 --> 16:25.920
I like a little pickle,

16:25.920 --> 16:28.720
but when I get served a whole fucking pickle spear

16:28.720 --> 16:31.120
with my sandwich, I'm like, this is wasteful.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.880
I just want a bite of pickle.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.120
Okay, okay, stop the show.

16:35.120 --> 16:35.840
Stop the show.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.120
I need to talk about this.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.080
All right.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.320
Isn't it weird, as you get to be an adult,

16:41.760 --> 16:44.160
you learn about this secret class of food,

16:44.960 --> 16:48.320
and it is between foods that you like to eat

16:48.320 --> 16:51.840
and foods that you don't like to eat, right?

16:51.840 --> 16:54.240
There's this weird subclass where it's like,

16:54.240 --> 16:57.040
I can eat a bit of this food,

16:57.040 --> 17:00.560
but too much of this food, and I don't like it anymore.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.880
That's wild, but I get it, right?

17:02.880 --> 17:04.560
Like, I feel that way.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.560
You know what I feel that way about mayonnaise?

17:07.920 --> 17:11.600
If there's a thin kiss of mayonnaise-

17:11.600 --> 17:12.080
Right.

17:12.080 --> 17:13.280
I do enjoy a little bit of-

17:13.280 --> 17:14.400
I go crazy for it, yeah.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.320
The wetness, yeah, the crazy for it.

17:16.320 --> 17:18.320
But if somebody just slops it on there,

17:19.120 --> 17:22.000
it starts to make you wonder, maybe I don't like mayonnaise

17:22.000 --> 17:25.600
because it's very present and very assertive in this sandwich.

17:26.720 --> 17:29.520
That is one of the hardest things about getting my toddler to eat

17:29.520 --> 17:31.120
is she's like, I don't think I like this.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.920
And I'm like, oh, what I want to say is like, that's fair.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.720
Like, okay, yeah, sure.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.440
You're a human being with thoughts and feelings all your own,

17:39.440 --> 17:44.400
and it's okay if you don't say enjoy, I don't know, celery.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.200
That's fine.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.480
It is weird.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.120
I always feel compelled to give my kid a pass

17:49.120 --> 17:52.960
on like, Charlie wouldn't eat cooked carrots a few nights ago.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.800
And she was like, do I have to eat these?

17:54.800 --> 17:56.560
I was like, absolutely not, they're foul.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.120
They're gross.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.400
They're so gross.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.720
I like a cooked carrot.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.320
I don't care, Travis.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.720
You're not her father, as I have to tell you weekly.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.720
I don't care how you feel about cooked carrots.

18:06.720 --> 18:07.220
I'm just saying.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.080
I want to pitch this, and this is actually,

18:10.080 --> 18:12.400
this is a pretty good blanket solution to a lot of,

18:12.400 --> 18:16.640
I don't like food, I don't like X food or drink questions

18:16.640 --> 18:18.560
that we get, and it's, you get it.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.320
Not that this is one of those, but go on.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.360
That's kind of one of those.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.680
It's that they don't, they're pretty sure they don't like them

18:23.680 --> 18:25.040
or else they would have eaten them at this point.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.240
They're afraid of pickles.

18:26.240 --> 18:29.200
So like, let's start there and move on.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.920
You get a big jar of pickles and just that,

18:33.920 --> 18:40.400
and you go out bouldering in the lovely picturesque canyons

18:40.400 --> 18:45.200
of Utah State, and then you have an accident

18:45.200 --> 18:47.920
and fall in a ravine and get your arm trapped

18:48.480 --> 18:50.800
by a very heavy rock that you can't move

18:50.800 --> 18:52.800
or free yourself from the situation.

18:53.440 --> 18:55.360
And you're going to spend some time there.

18:55.360 --> 18:59.440
I'm going to say slightly more than 120 hours.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.000
And what's that in your pack?

19:02.800 --> 19:04.400
It is the big jar of pickles.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.240
And after a while, like you are good.

19:06.240 --> 19:09.840
You and that jar of pickles are going to be fucking road dogs.

19:09.840 --> 19:13.200
Do you think if Aaron Ralston had a big jar of pickles

19:13.200 --> 19:15.280
and didn't like pickles and was trapped

19:15.280 --> 19:17.760
in that fateful canyon, he would be like,

19:17.760 --> 19:19.280
oh, but I don't like these pickles.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.720
And he would smash them to the ground?

19:20.720 --> 19:21.600
Probably not.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.080
He would probably get their nutrients and like them.

19:24.080 --> 19:28.640
What you're saying is you cannot say you don't like a food

19:28.640 --> 19:31.040
if you would eat it rather than starve to death?

19:33.120 --> 19:35.360
No, I'm not putting labels on it.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.720
I'm saying this is a good way.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.960
And then you get saved by the park ranger

19:38.960 --> 19:43.360
or you do remove your arm with like a credit card

19:43.360 --> 19:44.160
or whatever the fuck.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.680
And then you will be so grateful to pickles.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.760
Pickles will now be your favorite food.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.360
Five years from now, we get an email like,

19:51.360 --> 19:52.800
hey, I can't stop eating pickles.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.160
They saved my life in the picturesque canyons of Utah State.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.520
And by the way, did you guys know

19:59.520 --> 20:02.560
if you Google 120 something hours to figure out

20:02.560 --> 20:06.960
the name of the movie, you will find out it's 127 hours

20:06.960 --> 20:09.120
and you will see the top Google question,

20:09.120 --> 20:12.400
which is, is Aaron Ralston's arm still there?

20:12.400 --> 20:14.000
Which is so cool.

20:14.000 --> 20:14.640
I love that.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.320
I love the idea of park rangers.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.960
Like one of them, like they're just like two of them

20:18.960 --> 20:21.200
standing under a ravine looking up at this arm.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.400
Just like, ah, fuck, I don't know.

20:22.400 --> 20:23.040
Take your hat off.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.560
Can I throw your hat up at it?

20:24.560 --> 20:25.680
Nope, that didn't work.

20:25.680 --> 20:26.180
Shit.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.600
Do you think at hour 126 he started to get sentimental?

20:34.560 --> 20:35.840
Like I'm gonna miss this.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.480
This hasn't been fun through a lot of it,

20:38.480 --> 20:43.200
but I can't believe I've only got one hour left of this.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.360
Because he knew, he knew, he got trapped in there

20:49.360 --> 20:52.800
and within seconds he was like in 127 hours.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.160
The timer starts now.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.560
I'm cutting my way out of here.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.840
And you know, if he had made it to 128,

21:01.840 --> 21:03.280
he would have won that boulder.

21:03.280 --> 21:08.320
I want to dig into, I haven't been actually avoiding pickles.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.320
I've just never gotten the urge to chow down

21:10.320 --> 21:11.760
on one of these tiny crunchy guys.

21:12.320 --> 21:17.680
I feel like pickles more than, I mean, literally any food.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.240
Pickles are the food that are like,

21:20.240 --> 21:23.120
I open something getting ready to enjoy it

21:23.120 --> 21:25.440
and a pickle's like, I'm here too.

21:25.440 --> 21:26.400
Oh yeah, everyone.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.400
I've already, I already got your sandwich,

21:30.400 --> 21:32.080
a little puree, more sound.

21:32.080 --> 21:35.360
And come on in, the water is fine.

21:35.360 --> 21:38.320
Like the pickle is, I cannot tell you,

21:38.320 --> 21:40.960
there are so few foods that,

21:40.960 --> 21:42.720
I can't think of actually any others

21:42.720 --> 21:45.280
where like you get a food and it's coming to you

21:45.280 --> 21:47.760
and then you open it and then a pickle is like,

21:47.760 --> 21:50.000
I have also joined.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.640
I have come along for the adventure of my lifetime.

21:53.200 --> 21:56.240
It is like every restaurant when they were opening,

21:56.240 --> 21:59.440
like every accidentally ordered some pickles.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.640
That's what I always think when someone brings you your sandwich

22:02.640 --> 22:04.720
and chips and a pickle, it's like,

22:04.720 --> 22:08.480
okay, but this wasn't listed in the menu.

22:08.480 --> 22:11.120
It wasn't like, it comes with a random pick.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.360
I see the plate has chips.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.440
You would not want to forget me.

22:15.440 --> 22:18.000
I'd love to ensogen some of those beauties.

22:19.680 --> 22:23.280
There's just no way that you haven't had a pickle

22:24.080 --> 22:25.920
confronting you where you're just like,

22:25.920 --> 22:29.200
I don't know what to do with this weird salty garnish.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.360
You don't know what a pickle is

22:31.360 --> 22:33.920
and you've eaten a pickle on a sandwich

22:33.920 --> 22:35.440
but you didn't know, you were just like,

22:35.440 --> 22:36.960
that's just wet cucumber.

22:36.960 --> 22:39.440
I'll have that salty cucumber, yes, please.

22:39.440 --> 22:42.160
Maybe they watched that funny Rick and Morty episode

22:42.160 --> 22:45.040
and they think that the pickle has to be able to walk

22:45.040 --> 22:46.720
and talk and have a face and be funny.

22:46.720 --> 22:48.800
Isn't that weird that he's not called Rickle?

22:49.520 --> 22:51.520
That's funny too, Trav, fuck.

22:51.520 --> 22:52.320
Yeah, I know, right?

22:54.240 --> 22:56.400
What a generous concept, Pickle Rick.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.840
Can I do a yahoo?

22:57.840 --> 23:00.240
Yeah, I just do want to say there's no fucking chance

23:00.240 --> 23:02.960
that Pickle Rick is not in the new Tony Hawk remake.

23:02.960 --> 23:07.600
Just 100% right now, definitely happening.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.520
You think playable character or?

23:09.520 --> 23:10.560
Oh, for sure, for sure.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.960
Or like an NPC, you get a Questrum or?

23:12.960 --> 23:14.080
I've never played Tony Hawk.

23:14.080 --> 23:15.680
Pickle Rick, Baby Yoda.

23:17.840 --> 23:18.880
I don't know who else.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.880
Jared fucking, Jared Kushner.

23:20.880 --> 23:23.600
Jared Kushner's in there, he's playable.

23:24.560 --> 23:26.640
And he's smoking weed and that's like the thing,

23:26.640 --> 23:28.720
you know, he's got all the tricks.

23:28.720 --> 23:29.840
Fucking Billy Crystal.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.080
He's doing crystal meth.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.480
Graham Roebuck sent this question in.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.040
Thank you, Graham.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.600
It's yahoo answers user Savannah who asks,

23:37.600 --> 23:38.800
and this is a good question.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.920
How do surgeons remember each step during surgery?

23:43.920 --> 23:44.480
Thank you.

23:45.200 --> 23:48.400
How do they remember each step when they perform a surgery

23:48.400 --> 23:51.280
updated one day ago, but sometimes your brain can forget things

23:51.280 --> 23:53.120
and you can't always remember everything?

23:54.080 --> 23:56.480
Really walking us through the concept of the question there.

23:56.480 --> 23:57.600
But taking our hand.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.800
I appreciate that.

23:58.800 --> 24:02.960
In the last two weeks, I have baked six loaves of sourdough.

24:03.840 --> 24:09.280
And each time I have had to check the steps of the recipe.

24:09.280 --> 24:12.080
Fucking same sees with literally everything I cook.

24:12.080 --> 24:15.280
I have cooked a curry out of a box

24:15.280 --> 24:19.200
probably close to 100 times at this point in my life.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.360
Every time still though, I get out that box like,

24:21.360 --> 24:23.040
how much water you put in it?

24:23.040 --> 24:26.880
I should, I know it, but I'm so afraid to ruin dinner.

24:26.880 --> 24:30.080
And this is like ruining a pancreas or something

24:30.080 --> 24:31.840
like a human pancreas.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.920
Now, Trav, you said you bake six loaves of bread

24:35.920 --> 24:37.440
and you still have to look at the recipe.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.240
Correct.

24:38.240 --> 24:42.720
If a surgeon told me this is the sixth one of these I've done,

24:42.720 --> 24:44.560
I don't need to look at anything.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.440
That wouldn't fill me.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.760
Six is not like a lot.

24:47.760 --> 24:51.920
Okay, but just in counterpoint, if you go in

24:51.920 --> 24:54.320
and like before you go in, the surgeon's like,

24:54.320 --> 24:57.840
I do need to set up a little like music stand here

24:57.840 --> 25:00.240
with some step-by-steps on it.

25:00.240 --> 25:01.920
I don't think you'd be like, cool, cool.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.120
Let's do this, doc.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.560
Awesome, cool.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.400
That's why they have the fucking earpiece in.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.320
What?

25:08.320 --> 25:09.360
You never noticed that?

25:10.640 --> 25:13.280
They got an earpiece, every surgeon has.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.000
And then they got it.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.800
There's a boss surgeon telling them

25:16.800 --> 25:18.400
the different things they have to do

25:18.400 --> 25:21.920
and occasionally ribbled jokes.

25:21.920 --> 25:22.480
Oh my God.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.160
And the mood is dour.

25:24.160 --> 25:25.440
Here's the problem.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.800
Justin's married to a doctor.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.560
I have no idea if this is true or not.

25:28.560 --> 25:29.060
Yeah.

25:29.840 --> 25:34.000
All right, Dr. Bibbin, it's me, your favorite supporter.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.120
Sorry, Dr. Bibbin?

25:35.120 --> 25:38.080
Dr. Bibbin and I'm here on support

25:38.080 --> 25:41.360
and this time I thought I would deliver the steps to you

25:41.360 --> 25:44.400
in the form of a very fun rap that I have written.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.240
So it goes a little something like this.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.640
Tracheotomy, not a lobotomy.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.720
Cut that throat and cross the moat.

25:52.720 --> 25:55.520
That's what I call the river of blood.

25:55.520 --> 25:58.960
If you've made a river of blood, clean it up.

25:58.960 --> 25:59.760
Get it out.

25:59.760 --> 26:00.560
They've died.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.360
Oh, I skipped a step.

26:04.240 --> 26:04.720
Oh no.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.680
There has to be a moment, right?

26:08.320 --> 26:11.840
Even if it's like your 300th time performing that surgery

26:11.840 --> 26:15.360
that maybe you're like, it's like after you've driven a route

26:15.360 --> 26:17.360
a lot of times where like suddenly you're just home

26:17.360 --> 26:19.680
and you're like, huh.

26:19.680 --> 26:20.640
Absolutely not.

26:20.640 --> 26:22.240
I hope to fuck you wrong.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.080
I hope to fuck you wrong.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.480
I know what you're saying, Travis, and like point taken

26:27.040 --> 26:30.400
but I absolutely hope you are 100% correct.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.120
I guarantee that.

26:31.120 --> 26:34.000
The last thing I need is the dude's like,

26:34.560 --> 26:37.120
hey, I know this gallbladder is giving you problems

26:37.120 --> 26:40.240
but I'm putting this bitch on cruise control.

26:40.240 --> 26:40.960
That's the thing, right?

26:40.960 --> 26:43.600
There has to come a point where like it's an hour later

26:43.600 --> 26:46.080
and they're like, I did that one thing, right?

26:46.080 --> 26:49.040
Yeah, yeah, no, I definitely did.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.120
I just, it's a terrible picture you've painted, Travis.

26:51.120 --> 26:54.880
If I was a doctor, if I have to drill a hole in my house

26:54.880 --> 26:58.000
in the wall of a house to like put in a drywall anchor

26:58.000 --> 27:02.560
or something like that, I check my shit a hundred,

27:02.560 --> 27:04.320
like I will have marked it with a pencil

27:04.320 --> 27:07.120
and have the drill bit up against it and stop and be like,

27:07.120 --> 27:08.560
let me just do the stud finder.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.000
Let me just check this again.

27:10.000 --> 27:10.720
Let me check this again.

27:10.720 --> 27:13.360
Cause once I put this hole in my wall,

27:13.360 --> 27:17.760
that is going to be a hard thing to undo.

27:17.760 --> 27:21.200
I'm imagining me with scalpel on somebody's like arm

27:21.200 --> 27:24.160
or whatever, just like, and it is this arm, right?

27:24.160 --> 27:25.680
They wanted it on arm.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.840
There's something bad with arm, okay.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.920
Imagine waking up, you were put under

27:31.920 --> 27:34.240
for a gallbladder surgery and now you're waking up

27:34.240 --> 27:35.920
from the anesthesia and you're like, how did it go?

27:35.920 --> 27:38.240
And the doctor's like, you know, I didn't do it.

27:38.240 --> 27:41.360
I think I just need a little more time to get ready

27:41.360 --> 27:43.280
to just get in the right head space.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.560
We're going to do it tomorrow.

27:44.560 --> 27:45.760
I fucking chickened out.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.480
I'm sorry.

27:46.480 --> 27:49.120
I got in there and everything was so wet and red.

27:49.120 --> 27:51.040
I just bailed, I'm sorry.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.960
I had a tutorial up on the YouTube,

27:52.960 --> 27:55.280
but our internet's being so weird today.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.600
It was really laggy and I was so,

27:59.600 --> 28:03.440
and then I got a pop-up for like how to make the best pesto.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.920
And I was like, I do want to find out about pesto.

28:05.920 --> 28:09.040
And one thing led to another and I went down a deep rabbit hole

28:09.040 --> 28:10.080
and now you're awake.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.280
Oh, let me sew you up.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

28:12.000 --> 28:12.960
Oh shit, shit, shit.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.040
No, but they can't get mad at you.

28:15.040 --> 28:18.880
It's like, wait, you didn't know how to take out a gallbladder

28:18.880 --> 28:20.560
and it's like, well, I sure as fuck knew better

28:20.560 --> 28:22.560
than you would have done it at home.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.320
It's definitely better than that.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.880
I did a better job than you would have done.

28:26.880 --> 28:31.520
It's a thing that at some point you are some surgeon's,

28:31.520 --> 28:34.560
let's say third patient, not their first

28:34.560 --> 28:36.560
because that's scary right there.

28:36.560 --> 28:38.800
But they've practiced, they've done this.

28:38.800 --> 28:42.960
They had like, every surgeon has to have their first time

28:42.960 --> 28:44.640
without training wheels, right?

28:44.640 --> 28:45.200
Yeah, sure.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.360
Sure, I guess.

28:47.360 --> 28:49.520
But anyways, trust doctors, that is very important.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.280
Trust doctors, it is important,

28:51.280 --> 28:53.600
but there has to be a first time, right?

28:54.800 --> 28:55.360
Here's a fix.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.600
No, I want to talk about this.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.160
Okay.

28:58.160 --> 29:02.320
The first time, I think basically the way it works is like this.

29:02.880 --> 29:06.400
You have a big doctor and there's a little doctor.

29:06.400 --> 29:06.640
Right.

29:06.640 --> 29:10.000
And at first, the little doctor is like standing

29:10.000 --> 29:13.440
on the big doctor's feet and the big doctor's holding

29:13.440 --> 29:15.840
their hands and doing all the cutting for them, right?

29:15.840 --> 29:16.240
Yeah.

29:16.240 --> 29:19.200
And then they keep doing surgery after surgery.

29:19.200 --> 29:23.520
And then just one time they like look behind them

29:23.520 --> 29:27.680
and they realize that the big doctor is now in the bathroom.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.280
Now they're the big doctor.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.360
They slipped away in the night.

29:31.360 --> 29:32.320
They're dead?

29:32.320 --> 29:33.440
You're the doctor now.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.400
They were never alive.

29:34.400 --> 29:34.720
Oh.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.880
They were actually alive in this one.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.400
In this one, they were alive.

29:38.400 --> 29:39.520
That's a basic idea.

29:39.520 --> 29:43.840
It's basically like the bicycle, like learning to ride a bike.

29:43.840 --> 29:46.000
Like the big doctor is holding your waist

29:46.000 --> 29:48.080
and then you are doing the entire surgery

29:48.080 --> 29:50.080
and you realize like they let go already

29:50.080 --> 29:51.600
and you're just like still doing it.

29:51.600 --> 29:53.760
But if you're not ready, then you just kind of scalpel,

29:53.760 --> 29:54.480
just rip.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.520
I can't do it.

29:57.520 --> 30:00.240
And then you fast forward to the big doctor walking

30:00.240 --> 30:02.800
the little doctor down the aisle and giving them away

30:02.800 --> 30:04.880
at their wedding and then their first dance.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.640
And once again, the little doctor

30:06.640 --> 30:09.920
stands on a big doctor's feet and they dance.

30:09.920 --> 30:10.640
Oh, that's good.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.520
Let me hit you guys with this solution to this problem

30:13.520 --> 30:16.000
that this Yahoo Answers user has pointed out for us.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.720
I think doctors probably forget the steps of surgeries

30:18.720 --> 30:20.400
all the time and need cue cards or whatever.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.840
And I think one way around that is

30:23.840 --> 30:28.080
if each procedure that could be done

30:28.080 --> 30:31.280
had just the one doctor that could do it

30:31.280 --> 30:34.160
and they're the only one.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.800
So like if you need your tonsils out,

30:36.800 --> 30:42.160
they would call Dr. Tonsils.

30:42.160 --> 30:47.280
And it's a weird coincidence that that was doctor's name,

30:47.280 --> 30:48.880
but she would just roll up and be like,

30:48.880 --> 30:50.400
hello, I'm Dr. Tonsils.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.680
I know I look like Ms. Frizzle,

30:51.680 --> 30:53.200
but let's get those bad boys out.

30:53.200 --> 30:56.720
I've done this 659,000 times.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.200
I have a big sack full of tonsils

30:59.200 --> 31:00.880
that I carry around with me.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.480
If you have a heart attack,

31:02.480 --> 31:04.400
it'll be like, uh-oh, call Dr. Heart Attack.

31:04.400 --> 31:05.520
And he would roll up and be like,

31:05.520 --> 31:07.440
I do the heart attack surgery.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.400
I think that this is why you have,

31:11.840 --> 31:13.680
to be unfunny for a moment,

31:14.240 --> 31:18.560
highly trained nurses and other doctors in the room

31:18.560 --> 31:21.760
so that when you skip maybe steps six and seven,

31:21.760 --> 31:22.800
there's somebody going,

31:22.800 --> 31:25.520
hey, you're gonna tie that off, right?

31:26.240 --> 31:28.000
I mean, you were going to.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.360
You definitely were going to.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.160
I just wanted to say it.

31:30.160 --> 31:31.200
You're gonna tie that off, right?

31:31.200 --> 31:33.600
A bit of it of the doubt.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.720
Listen, we're not doctors.

31:34.720 --> 31:37.680
We have to make our money the honest way around here.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.800
We can't rely on big podcasters.

31:38.800 --> 31:41.040
I consider myself a bit of a podcast doctor.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.120
Okay, that's interesting.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.720
Oh, you've handed me a business card here.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.960
Yep, that's what it says, podcast doctor.

31:46.960 --> 31:48.240
That's a little bizarre.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.080
For a while, it said doctor podcast,

31:50.080 --> 31:51.040
but that was misleading.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.520
I'm something of a joke surgeon, aren't I?

31:54.640 --> 31:57.280
I get in there with my precision and my scalpel.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.920
Justin, anything you'd like to add?

31:59.920 --> 32:01.280
Justin, any sort of funny joke?

32:01.280 --> 32:02.080
I'd like to say this.

32:03.040 --> 32:03.920
Let's go to the Mighty Nein.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.440
I'm a comedy anesthesiologist

32:15.440 --> 32:17.440
because my jokes put people to sleep.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.480
Hey, that's good, Trav.

32:19.440 --> 32:20.400
I mean, it's not.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.600
I wish they didn't.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.200
It wasn't something I was aiming for.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.640
I want to tell you about stamps.com.

32:27.360 --> 32:29.360
Can you get a little bit of enthusiasm?

32:29.360 --> 32:32.560
I want to tell you about stamps.com.

32:32.560 --> 32:33.360
No, this is cool.

32:33.360 --> 32:34.480
Do the whole thing like this.

32:35.200 --> 32:38.640
For all our sakes, we need to avoid crowds.

32:38.640 --> 32:39.360
Who's this?

32:39.360 --> 32:41.680
This is the guy who loves stamps.com.

32:42.480 --> 32:43.600
Come up with a name.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.280
His name is-

32:45.280 --> 32:46.800
Don't say Dr. Stamps.

32:46.800 --> 32:47.360
Roger.

32:48.080 --> 32:48.400
Yeah.

32:49.120 --> 32:49.600
Rabbit.

32:50.560 --> 32:50.880
Okay.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.360
No relations, spelled different.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.680
R-A-B-E-T, rabbit.

32:55.680 --> 32:56.880
And Roger is spelled-

32:56.880 --> 32:58.480
This ad sucks.

32:58.480 --> 32:59.600
Okay.

33:00.160 --> 33:00.800
Okay, listen.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.000
We need to avoid crowds.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.120
Listen, listen to me.

33:03.120 --> 33:03.600
Listen to me.

33:03.600 --> 33:04.160
Are you listening?

33:04.160 --> 33:05.600
We need to avoid crowds at all costs,

33:05.600 --> 33:06.720
any way we can right now.

33:06.720 --> 33:09.760
But what if you need to go to the post office?

33:09.760 --> 33:12.640
What if you need postage to send out a letter and package?

33:12.640 --> 33:14.000
Don't worry.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.520
Stamps.com is here to help.

You got the job.

34:27.200 --> 34:28.640
You got me fucking hyphy.

34:28.640 --> 34:29.920
I want to tell you about Stitch Fix.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.320
It's a box of clothes that will come to your house

34:32.960 --> 34:36.160
and you're going to work with a personal stylist

34:36.160 --> 34:39.040
who is real and you're going to tell them

34:39.040 --> 34:42.640
what looks good on you, what kind of shapes you are.

34:42.640 --> 34:44.320
Hey Griffin, can I give you just a quick note?

34:44.320 --> 34:45.040
Mm-hmm.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.520
Like my, okay, for my ad,

34:47.520 --> 34:49.280
like I created kind of like a rich fiction.

34:49.840 --> 34:50.640
Sure, yeah.

34:50.640 --> 34:53.040
What the situation was, kind of what my character was.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.120
Like you could picture me like in a foxhole.

34:55.120 --> 34:55.920
But that's your thing.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.800
Like the reason people like me and what I bring to the show

34:58.800 --> 35:01.200
is that like my guy like doesn't give a fuck.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.240
And people like, like-

35:02.240 --> 35:03.360
Oh, could you play that up then?

35:04.080 --> 35:06.320
I'm saying there's like a type of overachiever

35:06.320 --> 35:08.160
that like really goes for the type of vibe

35:08.160 --> 35:08.800
that you're laying down.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.800
But then there's a bunch of like kind of cool

35:10.800 --> 35:15.520
like slacker, like stoner, fucking skeezy weirdo.

35:15.520 --> 35:17.120
I think you could slack more then.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.640
Could you give me a little more slack, please?

35:18.640 --> 35:20.080
Yeah, okay, I'll start over.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.760
Oh, clothes.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.280
Clothes, I get it.

35:25.920 --> 35:29.760
But Stitch Fix is great for this.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.440
You're gonna tell a website what kind of shapes you are.

35:36.720 --> 35:37.440
No, it's cool.

35:38.480 --> 35:39.200
It's whatever.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.560
And then a personal stylist.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.800
And that sounds so like grown up, I get it.

35:46.800 --> 35:49.040
But it's, trust me, it's cash.

35:49.920 --> 35:51.920
They're gonna set you up nice.

35:51.920 --> 35:56.000
Colors, styles, budget, and a $20 styling fee.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.040
But it's credited towards anything you keep.

36:00.320 --> 36:03.840
Anyway, there's no subscription required,

36:03.840 --> 36:06.480
which is cool because we hate subscriptions, don't we?

36:07.360 --> 36:09.920
And they have shipping and returns.

36:12.320 --> 36:13.600
So you can get started to-

36:15.600 --> 36:19.120
The shipping and returns and exchanges are easy and free.

36:19.120 --> 36:20.480
Like everything should be.

36:20.480 --> 36:22.720
Listen, because I'm gonna get real now.

36:22.720 --> 36:26.320
You need to get started today at stitchfix.com

36:26.320 --> 36:27.600

36:31.840 --> 36:35.520
You didn't just say 25%, I'll tell you, you're fucking lying.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.920
No, I'm not gonna say psych on this one.

36:37.920 --> 36:42.080
Go to stitchfix.com slash my brother for 25% off

36:42.080 --> 36:43.760

36:46.480 --> 36:47.840
You got this in you.

36:47.840 --> 36:51.200
You got this in you, stitchfix.com slash my brother.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.400
Oh, we all use it.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.200
And that we all, I might say,

36:57.200 --> 36:59.840
we all have personal experience with Stitch Fix.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.000
I'm wearing Stitch Fix pants right now.

37:02.640 --> 37:06.000
Wow, and I'm wearing Travis's Stitch Fix pants also.

37:06.000 --> 37:06.320
What?

37:06.320 --> 37:07.200
I'm in this pocket.

37:08.000 --> 37:08.320
Hey!

37:09.200 --> 37:09.840
Hey.

37:09.840 --> 37:10.400
What's up?

37:11.040 --> 37:12.880
I'm also wearing your buns.

37:12.880 --> 37:13.200
Cool.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.600
Hey, Max Funsters, it's Jesse Thorne.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.320
This week on my public radio interview show Bullseye,

37:20.320 --> 37:22.960
I'm talking with Tina Fey and Robert Karloch

37:22.960 --> 37:25.360
about creating Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,

37:25.360 --> 37:29.360
30 Rock, and also just kind of why they're the best at everything.

37:29.360 --> 37:33.200
There was a window of time when we used to go to awards things

37:33.200 --> 37:36.400
and pick up our prizes and party with the people from Mad Men.

37:36.400 --> 37:39.200
You can find Bullseye at maximumfun.org

37:39.200 --> 37:42.160
or wherever you listen to podcasts.

37:42.160 --> 37:48.880
Just search for Bullseye with Jesse Thorne.

37:55.840 --> 37:56.080
Huh?

37:58.720 --> 38:00.160
Did that come from my pocket?

38:00.160 --> 38:00.880
Open your pocket.

38:00.880 --> 38:01.360
Oh, okay.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.720
I want a munch.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.000
Squad!

38:08.000 --> 38:12.160
But I want too much.

38:12.160 --> 38:12.960
Squad!

38:16.160 --> 38:18.000
Welcome to Munch Squad, it's a podcast within a podcast.

38:18.000 --> 38:18.720
Within a pocket.

38:19.440 --> 38:20.400
Within a pocket.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.880
This is Throwback Munch Squad,

38:23.680 --> 38:29.200
which is a podcast mini-series within a podcast within a podcast

38:30.800 --> 38:34.560
where we talk about the real latest

38:34.560 --> 38:40.160
because they're very old, they're very old ads

38:40.160 --> 38:42.640
because no one is making new food anymore.

38:42.640 --> 38:48.000
And the ones that are are depressing and not funny anymore.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.360
They used to be very funny.

38:49.920 --> 38:52.000
Fast food chains, kids don't remember,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.880
but fast food chains used to do silly things

38:54.880 --> 38:56.320
and now they just do boring things.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.160
Like if I go to one of my old sources,

38:59.280 --> 39:02.080
here's one of the headers.

39:02.080 --> 39:06.160
Brewster's real ice cream adds sweet and salty treats to menus.

39:06.160 --> 39:06.400
Right?

39:06.400 --> 39:07.680
That seems fine.

39:07.680 --> 39:09.760
Very first sentence of this press release is

39:11.200 --> 39:15.760
with the effects of coronavirus, COVID-19, still top of mind,

39:15.760 --> 39:18.400
creating new routines and traditions can be restorative.

39:19.360 --> 39:21.440
Hey, are you just selling ice cream?

39:21.440 --> 39:22.240
Are you?

39:22.240 --> 39:24.480
Because I think you need to calm down.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.560
I'm trying to have fun over here with the Munch Squad.

39:26.560 --> 39:26.880
Yeah.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.480
So we are gonna head on back,

39:30.480 --> 39:35.200
get in the way back machine, April 16th, 2001.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.120
This is from Oliver and I very much appreciate it.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.480
Arby's has appetite for adults.

39:47.040 --> 39:47.520
All right.

39:47.520 --> 39:48.080
Oh no.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.280
This is maybe the sexiest Munch Squad I've ever done.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.640
So hang in there with me.

39:53.360 --> 39:56.320
With its adult positioning now established,

39:56.320 --> 40:02.320
Arby's is testing an advertising approach designed for mature audiences.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.720
The quick service chain is once again,

40:06.720 --> 40:10.800
tapping the star power of R&B crooner, Barry White.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.680
Only this time as a new character,

40:13.680 --> 40:16.880
the company refers to as Appetite Man.

40:18.320 --> 40:19.200
Shit, yeah.

40:19.200 --> 40:25.920
Aimed at touting the crave appeal of the chain's menu,

40:26.720 --> 40:30.720
Arby's created, see these days we say craveability.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.840
That's how far we've come in these 19 years.

40:33.840 --> 40:36.560
Arby's created a character it thought would represent how,

40:36.560 --> 40:42.640
quote, passionate, seductive, and discriminating a person's appetite might be.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.760
I know what you're saying.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.880
Is this the same person that's driving into Arby's?

40:46.880 --> 40:49.280
And the answer is yes, it is.

40:49.280 --> 40:53.760
The Appetite urges you to act on your real desires

40:53.760 --> 40:58.480
and not settle for ordinary fast food because your appetite wants the best.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.560
They don't finish the sentence,

41:00.560 --> 41:04.960
but I'm assuming it ends with thing that is available at Arby's.

41:05.680 --> 41:08.800
The best thing that they have on the menu of Arby's.

41:09.520 --> 41:13.920
So what better personification of what the company refers to as,

41:13.920 --> 41:17.760
quote, passion, love, and seduction than Mr. White?

41:18.880 --> 41:22.320
The singer was also a natural choice since the company

41:22.320 --> 41:25.760
already had good results using him in its 99 campaign.

41:26.400 --> 41:31.440
This is fucking so wild that someone's like three years after the fact like,

41:31.440 --> 41:35.040
can we try Barry White again and this time we'll call him Appetite Man?

41:35.840 --> 41:37.280
And that person got promoted.

41:37.280 --> 41:44.240
So is the idea that you watch it and his singing makes you horny,

41:44.240 --> 41:48.400
but because you're watching the Arby's commercial it's kind of a coin flip

41:48.400 --> 41:51.680
of whether you will feel like wanting to have sex with a human being

41:51.680 --> 41:54.400
or wanting to go eat a beef and cheddar max?

41:54.400 --> 41:54.880
Or both!

41:54.880 --> 42:01.040
Actually, in this specific situation, I have the only,

42:01.040 --> 42:05.360
they describe what the ads they're making for test markets are, right?

42:05.360 --> 42:07.360
Okay.

42:08.240 --> 42:14.000
And these are, there's only one actual ad that they made

42:14.000 --> 42:16.560
with Appetite Man that I could actually find.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.080
So we're gonna take 30 seconds to listen to that

42:18.080 --> 42:21.680
and then I'm gonna describe the other wild ones that they had in store.

42:21.680 --> 42:22.720
So here's this first.

42:23.360 --> 42:27.520
This is your Appetite Talking and this is a tasty alert.

42:27.520 --> 42:29.840
You're not gonna believe this baby.

42:29.840 --> 42:33.200
Right now, five Arby's roast beefs are just $5.95.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.280
Oh, that slow roasted beef.

42:36.080 --> 42:40.640
So tender, so juicy, and those sauces.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.320
That's what you want, baby.

42:42.320 --> 42:46.560
Get five Arby's regular roast beef sandwiches for just $5.95, but not for long.

42:47.120 --> 42:50.560
If you want the tasty, you gotta be hasty.

42:50.560 --> 42:52.640
Give in to your grown-up tastes.

42:53.680 --> 42:54.320
That's cool.

42:54.320 --> 42:58.560
I think that it is nice to know that for under six dollars

42:58.560 --> 43:04.480
I could potentially permanently halt my entire gastrointestinal process

43:04.480 --> 43:06.000
for the rest of my life.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.160
Five Arby's, five of those bad boys.

43:08.160 --> 43:11.760
Five is, hey Barry, five is so many.

43:11.760 --> 43:13.040
Oh my gosh, it's a lot.

43:13.680 --> 43:16.080
And there is no point in that commercial where he's like,

43:16.080 --> 43:17.760
and share them with a friend.

43:18.400 --> 43:22.000
Like it's just for me, I think, to eat these five sandwiches.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.600
If I put five of them in me,

43:23.600 --> 43:25.840
the organs inside me that make the poop happen

43:25.840 --> 43:29.120
would look at each other like that's it.

43:30.240 --> 43:33.040
In the commercials, the soul singer invades people's lives

43:33.040 --> 43:37.280
with the Pavlovian timing to personify their hunger pains,

43:37.280 --> 43:38.720
first as a voice,

43:38.720 --> 43:41.840
then appearing in miniature in the amazed person's stomach.

43:42.480 --> 43:46.560
This is so fucking unfair that I don't have the, it's so,

43:47.520 --> 43:50.560
quote, there's a little Barry in all of us,

43:50.560 --> 43:51.840
says Scott Lippitt,

43:51.840 --> 43:56.080
exec VP group account director on Arby's.

43:56.080 --> 43:58.400
In one spot, a man is driving his wife,

43:58.400 --> 44:00.320
obviously in labor, to the hospital.

44:00.880 --> 44:03.040
Suddenly he hears Mr. White say,

44:03.040 --> 44:06.080
hey baby, we're in the mood for something tasty.

44:06.640 --> 44:09.440
The expectant father looks down at his stomach

44:09.440 --> 44:13.200
and sees Mr. White who says, this is your appetite, baby.

44:13.200 --> 44:14.960
You gotta give into love.

44:14.960 --> 44:18.160
The dad-to-be now asks, but do we have time?

44:18.160 --> 44:21.760
The appetite man has the answer, drive through.

44:21.760 --> 44:24.320
The spot closes with the wife driving

44:24.320 --> 44:25.680
while the husband eats.

44:25.680 --> 44:26.180
Wow.

44:27.600 --> 44:28.800
Oh, wow.

44:28.800 --> 44:32.960
Do you know how wild it is that in this spot,

44:32.960 --> 44:36.000
there's a man whose wife is in the passenger seat

44:36.000 --> 44:39.120
with a small baby in her stomach

44:39.120 --> 44:40.800
and then this man discovers

44:40.800 --> 44:43.200
that a small Barry White lives in his stomach?

44:43.200 --> 44:44.240
He's grown up.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.440
How has that played out?

44:45.440 --> 44:47.520
Do you think when he looks the fate,

44:47.520 --> 44:49.280
like is it just CGI'd in

44:49.280 --> 44:53.600
or is it like Barry White's face is the stomach?

44:53.600 --> 44:54.560
It's practical.

44:54.560 --> 44:56.160
I bet it's Barry White in a diaper,

44:56.160 --> 44:57.840
just like a big baby Barry White.

44:58.640 --> 45:01.920
A second effort takes a direct shot at McDonald's

45:02.560 --> 45:06.000
where Mr. White asks, which is very good,

45:06.000 --> 45:10.080
Mr. White asks, hey baby, why are you eating that clown food?

45:10.080 --> 45:11.200
Oh, wow.

45:11.200 --> 45:11.700
Yeah.

45:12.560 --> 45:13.280
Get him.

45:13.280 --> 45:14.960
Sick burn, dog.

45:14.960 --> 45:18.160
So, uh, appetite man is a campaign

45:18.160 --> 45:21.120
that I'm guessing they just chicken out on

45:21.120 --> 45:23.680
because everything's on YouTube and this is not.

45:24.320 --> 45:28.160
So, uh, that seems unfair to me personally,

45:28.160 --> 45:30.000
so I don't think they ever actually went through with it.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.080
Will you read the first line of the presser again?

45:32.960 --> 45:33.840
Sure, bud.

45:33.840 --> 45:34.560
I'm happy to.

45:35.120 --> 45:37.360
With its adult positioning now established.

45:37.360 --> 45:38.320
By what?

45:38.320 --> 45:38.960
Like what?

45:39.760 --> 45:40.960
What the fuck did they do?

45:40.960 --> 45:43.040
Did they establish their adult positioning

45:43.040 --> 45:45.120
with the headline of this press release

45:45.120 --> 45:46.160
or were they doing,

45:46.160 --> 45:48.560
were they like sexing it up a little bit?

45:48.560 --> 45:51.280
Actually, let's drill down on this for a second.

45:51.280 --> 45:51.760
Yeah.

45:51.760 --> 45:54.640
With its adult positioning now established,

45:55.520 --> 45:57.760
Arby's is testing and advertising a purge

45:57.760 --> 45:59.520
designed for mature audiences.

46:00.160 --> 46:03.520
So what, what is happening?

46:03.520 --> 46:05.840
Are you saying that adults love it so much

46:05.840 --> 46:09.680
that we're just gonna make sexy ads for adults now?

46:09.680 --> 46:10.560
Is that the way it works?

46:10.560 --> 46:13.040
If I may take it one step further

46:13.040 --> 46:15.520
and go before the comment,

46:15.520 --> 46:18.160
was there a time where people were like,

46:18.160 --> 46:20.560
Arby's, that's only for kids.

46:20.560 --> 46:24.560
That's kid, that's a three quarter pound pile of meat.

46:24.560 --> 46:25.360
That's just for kids.

46:25.360 --> 46:26.480
Arby's is for kids.

46:27.120 --> 46:28.160
That's kids stuff.

46:28.160 --> 46:30.880
What kind of grown adult would eat Arby's?

46:31.680 --> 46:34.480
Us grownups like thick slices of beef.

46:36.080 --> 46:37.600
These tissue papers thin.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.280
Give me a slab.

46:39.280 --> 46:41.120
What are you talking about?

46:41.120 --> 46:44.320
I want a fine food restaurant that sells cigarettes.

46:44.320 --> 46:46.400
That's my five-year-old nephew,

46:46.400 --> 46:48.720
Gorfus loves jamoca shakes.

46:48.720 --> 46:51.680
Those curly fries, too whimsical.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.040
They put them around their fingers.

46:53.040 --> 46:54.240
That's why they make them curly

46:54.240 --> 46:56.240
so fucking kids can do that.

46:56.240 --> 46:58.400
I want adult food for a man.

46:58.400 --> 47:00.320
Give me some horny food.

47:00.320 --> 47:02.720
I have horny adult food cravings

47:02.720 --> 47:07.600
and Arby's with its thin slices of meat can't satisfy it.

47:08.160 --> 47:12.720
I have a dark passenger that craves them meaty slabs

47:12.720 --> 47:15.120
that I can really bite into.

47:16.560 --> 47:17.760
Fucking motts sticks?

47:17.760 --> 47:20.720
They might as well be pacifiers for babies

47:20.720 --> 47:23.360
because I'm an adult and I don't eat that kind of shit.

47:23.360 --> 47:24.240
Now what's this?

47:24.240 --> 47:25.440
Barry White likes it?

47:26.080 --> 47:27.360
Well, hold on now.

47:27.920 --> 47:28.960
Hold on.

47:28.960 --> 47:30.400
If my favorite singer,

47:32.160 --> 47:37.520
if my favorite singer in 2001, Barry White likes Arby's,

47:37.520 --> 47:41.840
maybe he wouldn't throw in with some fucking kid food.

47:41.840 --> 47:42.320
No.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.320
This is food for grown adults.

47:44.320 --> 47:45.440
I trust him.

47:45.440 --> 47:47.040
He knows sex.

47:47.040 --> 47:49.920
This is a passion project by Mr. White.

47:49.920 --> 47:51.520
Emphasis on the passion.

47:52.800 --> 47:55.600
I went lots of places to fuck this sandwich.

47:55.600 --> 47:56.240
Look at it.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.000
Put it anywhere.

47:59.040 --> 48:01.120
Barry, that always a stick to the coffee, Barry.

48:02.160 --> 48:05.040
Listen, when you stack up this many slices

48:05.040 --> 48:07.840
of delicious roast beef,

48:07.840 --> 48:09.840
the odds are somewhere on it,

48:09.840 --> 48:12.320
it will look like genitalia.

48:12.320 --> 48:13.760
All right, Barry, if you could just read,

48:13.760 --> 48:16.400
it's the guy's driving his wife to-

48:16.400 --> 48:20.320
I got one of the sesame seeds from the buns

48:20.320 --> 48:21.920
right in my pee hole.

48:21.920 --> 48:23.120
That's not sexy.

48:23.920 --> 48:26.880
Baby, I don't know what is.

48:26.880 --> 48:29.120
Slather that up in horsey sauce.

48:29.120 --> 48:29.840
And oh, nope.

48:29.840 --> 48:33.040
The tanginess of the sauce does not feel good.

48:33.040 --> 48:34.080
No, Mr. White, please.

48:34.080 --> 48:36.320
It just says drive through, baby.

48:37.040 --> 48:39.280
Let me rub your feet in au jus.

48:39.280 --> 48:42.160
Oh, okay, now you're actually doing that to me?

48:43.920 --> 48:45.120
Yeah, baby.

48:45.120 --> 48:46.320
Mr. White, I am-

48:46.320 --> 48:47.200
Sexual.

48:47.200 --> 48:48.000
Very comfortable.

48:49.840 --> 48:51.120
Sexy Arby's food.

48:52.720 --> 48:55.600
Arby's is still for adults and kids alike.

48:55.600 --> 48:59.040
And I really appreciate them sponsoring this episode.

48:59.040 --> 49:02.000
It's a co-branded episode between them and Buick.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.760
No, we couldn't get Buick.

49:03.760 --> 49:05.280
We couldn't get Buick.

49:05.280 --> 49:10.880
I would fucking put a stick of dynamite in my car

49:10.880 --> 49:12.640
and blow it up and never have it again

49:12.640 --> 49:14.720
to eat one beef and cheddar right now.

49:14.720 --> 49:15.760
I'm looking at a picture-

49:15.760 --> 49:18.720
I'm confronting an enormous picture of one right now.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.760
I have a cheap kill bill replica sword

49:25.760 --> 49:28.800
my friend got me at an anime convention a few years ago,

49:28.800 --> 49:31.200
but due to neglect slash terrible craftsmanship,

49:31.200 --> 49:32.800
it has started to fall apart.

49:32.800 --> 49:35.200
It's not sharp, but it is a real sword.

49:35.760 --> 49:37.840
Are swords recyclable?

49:37.840 --> 49:40.240
Is there something better I can do with it?

49:40.240 --> 49:41.920
That's from Katana Katie.

49:41.920 --> 49:42.420
Woof.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.920
What kind of maintenance is one supposed to be doing

49:45.920 --> 49:47.920
to the kill bill sword that their friend got them?

49:47.920 --> 49:48.560
Cause I have-

49:48.560 --> 49:49.280
Sword oil.

49:49.840 --> 49:51.200
I have not been doing that.

49:52.640 --> 49:54.640
That's one thing you learn about being an adult

49:55.440 --> 49:57.600
is that almost everything that you take-

49:57.600 --> 49:59.840
Like anytime you start Googling about how to,

49:59.840 --> 50:04.560
almost every adult thing requires some sort of regular oil

50:04.560 --> 50:06.320
and lubrication that nobody's doing.

50:06.320 --> 50:06.880
That's young, yeah.

50:08.560 --> 50:12.880
There's a really narrow window in your life

50:13.840 --> 50:17.440
where being allowed to have a sword

50:17.440 --> 50:21.280
and wanting to have a sword are happening at the same time.

50:21.920 --> 50:25.920
Because when you're young, of course we all wanted swords.

50:25.920 --> 50:26.640
I would ask-

50:26.640 --> 50:28.320
We would go to anime conventions

50:28.320 --> 50:31.600
by which I mean almost exclusively mid-Ohio con

50:31.600 --> 50:33.200
every year with our dad and I would say,

50:33.200 --> 50:36.720
father, father, will you buy me one of these big cool swords?

50:36.720 --> 50:38.240
And most of the time the answer was no

50:38.240 --> 50:41.440
until I was old enough to get a sword

50:41.440 --> 50:44.480
and he got me a replica buster sword from Final Fantasy

50:44.480 --> 50:47.360
which was unwieldy and difficult to use.

50:47.360 --> 50:50.720
But then I did get high once and chop a watermelon with it

50:50.720 --> 50:52.000
and forget to clean it.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.360
I forgot about that.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.600
It got sticky and rusty and bad,

50:55.600 --> 50:59.280
but then also I didn't want swords anymore.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.680
So I threw that in the garbage can.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.440
Like I threw it in a dumpster.

51:03.440 --> 51:05.760
The answer is the only way to throw away a sword

51:05.760 --> 51:08.400
is a dumpster illegally dumping a sword right in there.

51:08.400 --> 51:10.960
I would worry that if that happened,

51:10.960 --> 51:13.760
someone might find it and use it in a murder

51:14.800 --> 51:17.120
and there's my prints all over it.

51:17.120 --> 51:18.720
All over it and your watermelon.

51:19.440 --> 51:20.960
I would say you would have to melt it

51:20.960 --> 51:24.160
in some kind of ceremonial fire.

51:24.160 --> 51:25.120
That's cool.

51:25.120 --> 51:29.520
And then maybe forge a new sword for your children

51:30.240 --> 51:36.160
so that they can carry on your wandering warrior ways.

51:37.280 --> 51:39.040
I know people are probably wondering,

51:39.040 --> 51:40.960
was it the coolest fucking thing you've ever seen

51:40.960 --> 51:43.760
when you cut a watermelon all up with a buster sword?

51:43.760 --> 51:46.000
And the answer is yes, it's unimaginable.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.240
We did it indoors in a kitchen.

51:48.240 --> 51:50.000
It was so fucking rad

51:50.000 --> 51:51.920
and the best thing I'll ever do in my whole life.

51:51.920 --> 51:54.800
And it's bad to have peaked at like 20.

51:54.800 --> 51:56.000
Is it advisable, Griffin?

51:56.000 --> 51:57.920
Like if somebody right now is eyeballing

51:57.920 --> 51:59.600
that watermelon they got from the store

51:59.600 --> 52:02.080
and their buster sword replica.

52:02.080 --> 52:04.160
Would you recommend that they do it?

52:04.160 --> 52:07.360
This was my, I want to say sophomore year of college,

52:07.360 --> 52:09.440
which means I was terribly high.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.440
There was no part of this that was good.

52:13.440 --> 52:16.480
You hear me say I cut up a watermelon

52:16.480 --> 52:19.040
in a big omnislash in our kitchen

52:19.040 --> 52:21.680
with a replica, a very, very heavy buster sword.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.280
And you think, well, that's only the kind of thing

52:23.280 --> 52:24.720
that a very high person would do.

52:24.720 --> 52:28.080
And then you think, uh-oh, but they shouldn't be.

52:29.440 --> 52:31.760
How many people were around you, Griffin?

52:31.760 --> 52:32.640
Everyone was around me.

52:32.640 --> 52:34.720
I'm not, I knew it was a one-time thing.

52:34.720 --> 52:36.560
Everyone was around you, okay.

52:36.560 --> 52:38.000
Yeah, they were supporting me.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.160
They all had a hand on me as I did it,

52:40.160 --> 52:42.080
channeling their energy into me.

52:42.080 --> 52:43.920
Melted Down is a good one

52:43.920 --> 52:46.720
and you can turn it into something like weak

52:47.440 --> 52:50.400
and then you're fine with about the murder part of things.

52:50.400 --> 52:50.960
That's fair.

52:51.840 --> 52:53.120
Just hang it to Goodwill and be like,

52:53.120 --> 52:54.080
y'all want a sword?

52:54.080 --> 52:55.040
They probably will say yes.

52:55.920 --> 52:56.640
Fuck yeah.

52:56.640 --> 52:57.520
Yeah, we'll take it.

52:57.520 --> 52:58.560
Take a sword.

52:58.560 --> 52:59.680
Should have a garage sale

53:01.200 --> 53:03.760
and it's just a folding table with one sword on it.

53:03.760 --> 53:04.960
When someone goes to buy it, you're like,

53:04.960 --> 53:07.680
oh, I can't just sell this to you.

53:07.680 --> 53:09.200
You have to prove yourself.

53:09.200 --> 53:10.000
That's so worthy.

53:10.000 --> 53:10.720
Let me get the owner.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.360
And by the way, they're yelling this at you

53:13.360 --> 53:14.400
from six feet away.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.800
So you just sort of arranged this

53:16.800 --> 53:18.480
so people could come and look at your sword?

53:19.200 --> 53:20.480
Well, prove you're worthy.

53:21.120 --> 53:22.400
I'm charging a mission, by the way.

53:22.400 --> 53:24.800
You owe me $15.

53:24.800 --> 53:26.640
No, the stuff for sale is in the garage,

53:26.640 --> 53:28.160
but you got to get past me first.

53:31.840 --> 53:32.640
Go get your sword.

53:32.640 --> 53:34.000
Go home and get your sword.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.040
We'll cross blades.

53:35.600 --> 53:36.160
Oh, shit.

53:36.160 --> 53:38.000
Is yours a real Atori Hanzo?

53:38.000 --> 53:38.400
Fuck.

53:38.400 --> 53:39.200
Yeah, it is.

53:39.200 --> 53:40.960
I got some cool VHSs in there

53:40.960 --> 53:43.200
that are going for a fucking song, man.

53:43.200 --> 53:45.200
But you do have to duel me right here

53:45.200 --> 53:48.640
from six feet away, which is going to be tough, man.

53:48.640 --> 53:50.640
1v1 me, bro.

53:50.640 --> 53:53.760
Go outside of your yard, get a big fake rock.

53:53.760 --> 53:54.260
Okay.

53:55.520 --> 53:58.720
Jam the sword down into the big fake rock.

53:58.720 --> 54:01.760
Now, are you're just assuming that in my yard

54:01.760 --> 54:03.120
there are big fake rocks?

54:03.840 --> 54:04.720
Yeah, Travis.

54:04.720 --> 54:06.400
Buy a big fake rock.

54:06.400 --> 54:06.960
Oh, okay.

54:06.960 --> 54:07.760
Why would there be?

54:07.760 --> 54:09.200
If it's in your yard, it's a real rock.

54:09.200 --> 54:10.640
Yes, that's what I was going to say.

54:11.840 --> 54:12.800
A big fake rock.

54:13.440 --> 54:15.520
You jam the sword into the big fake rock.

54:15.520 --> 54:17.520
You wait for people to pass by.

54:17.520 --> 54:19.760
They see a sword in a big fake rock

54:19.760 --> 54:22.080
and they're like, fuck, of course.

54:22.080 --> 54:23.600
Just human nature.

54:24.480 --> 54:26.560
You have to try to see if you're the one.

54:26.560 --> 54:27.060
Yeah.

54:27.600 --> 54:30.720
So they go to remove the blade from the rock

54:30.720 --> 54:32.000
and guess what they've discovered?

54:32.800 --> 54:34.160
Uh, just a moment too late.

54:35.120 --> 54:35.760
Oh, no.

54:37.040 --> 54:38.640
Just the wrong moment.

54:38.640 --> 54:39.920
One second too late.

54:39.920 --> 54:42.720
You've fallen in my trap and you've touched the jelly

54:42.720 --> 54:45.040
I put all over the sword handle.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.160
Oh, my God.

54:46.160 --> 54:47.280
Oh, shit.

54:47.280 --> 54:50.240
Now you're like, what do you have on your hands?

54:50.240 --> 54:51.120
Uh, excuse me.

54:51.120 --> 54:51.920
I'm going to sue you.

54:51.920 --> 54:52.960
I have jelly all over my hands.

54:52.960 --> 54:54.320
Why do you have all the jelly on your hands?

54:54.320 --> 54:56.720
Is it trying to take the sword out of the stone?

54:56.720 --> 54:58.160
Well, that's fucking idiotic.

54:59.360 --> 55:00.080
You're the idiot.

55:01.040 --> 55:02.160
You got jelly on your hands.

55:02.160 --> 55:02.800
You wear that.

55:02.800 --> 55:03.280
You own it.

55:03.280 --> 55:04.480
That's my sword.

55:04.480 --> 55:05.360
It's in my yard.

55:05.920 --> 55:06.960
It's my sword.

55:06.960 --> 55:10.000
You don't have the right to take a sword that's mine on my property.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.480
Would you just walk up and try to take my bird bath

55:12.480 --> 55:13.920
to see if you're the one?

55:13.920 --> 55:14.420
No.

55:14.420 --> 55:17.060
I bought this house to try to give myself time

55:17.060 --> 55:19.540
to get strong enough to pull the sword out of the stone.

55:19.540 --> 55:21.780
And you think you're just going to walk up here and take it?

55:21.780 --> 55:22.980
That's why you have a jelly.

55:22.980 --> 55:25.940
That's why there's little bees all over you right now.

55:25.940 --> 55:27.540
They're swimming around your hands,

55:27.540 --> 55:28.580
waiting for the moment of strike.

55:28.580 --> 55:31.060
Now do you want that sword?

55:31.060 --> 55:32.820
Because I will sell it to you.

55:33.380 --> 55:35.460
Now you've bought it and your prints are all over it.

55:35.460 --> 55:36.500
No, you know what?

55:36.500 --> 55:37.300
I'll say this.

55:37.300 --> 55:38.180
Go ahead and try again.

55:38.180 --> 55:39.540
And if you can pull it out, you're right.

55:39.540 --> 55:40.820
You got jellied again.

55:40.820 --> 55:41.140
Why?

55:41.140 --> 55:42.100
You fell for it.

55:42.100 --> 55:44.100
You knew there was jelly on there.

55:44.100 --> 55:45.460
You knew there was jelly.

55:45.460 --> 55:47.460
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

55:47.460 --> 55:48.420

56:04.180 --> 56:07.380
t-shirt with our old art on it to protest our new art.

56:07.380 --> 56:09.700
We have some fun summer magnets.

56:10.420 --> 56:12.260
And there's still,

56:12.260 --> 56:15.620
let me just check a few left

56:15.620 --> 56:18.180

56:18.740 --> 56:19.940
So you do want to get,

56:21.860 --> 56:22.740
I can't even.

56:22.740 --> 56:23.460
It's tough to even.

56:23.460 --> 56:24.180
It is there.

56:24.180 --> 56:25.460
I'll just say it's there.

56:25.460 --> 56:26.820
I'll just say it's there.

56:26.820 --> 56:28.340
I also want to say,

56:28.340 --> 56:28.900
if you go to,

56:29.620 --> 56:31.460
this is just a little secret between friends,

56:31.460 --> 56:32.340
between you and me.

Putting the Days to Bed.

56:55.780 --> 56:56.660
Great tunes, man.

56:57.620 --> 57:00.900
Crank them up over the cooler

57:01.460 --> 57:03.060

outside at a safe place.

Thank you, Nicole.

57:28.100 --> 57:30.820
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Crabby, who asks,

What is the next big ring pop flavor?

Kiss your dad.

57:44.420 --> 58:01.380
This has been my brother, me, kiss your dad, square on the lips.
