00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:53.360
Happy birthday to us. Happy birthday to us. Happy birthday, my brother, my brother, and me.

00:53.360 --> 01:00.720
Happy birthday to us. It's the birthday episode. November 8th was the day we're recording on

01:00.720 --> 01:08.240
November 10th, but I guess it's all of our birthdays on November 8th. Today we are all

01:08.240 --> 01:12.320
birthdays. Gotta do this every year. Not just every year since you've been doing the podcast,

01:12.320 --> 01:18.240
but like every year since I was fucking born, and I'm sorry. I don't know if you guys know how

01:18.240 --> 01:23.520
fucking baby gestation works, but that shit was out of my control. Forgive me if I've mentioned

01:23.520 --> 01:28.480
this before, but Gervin, have you looked into legally changing your birthday? You know, it's

01:28.480 --> 01:34.480
funny you bring that up because Jay-Z I think just did that. Jay-Z just did a tweet last week

01:34.480 --> 01:38.800
where he was like, yeah, my birthday's on Tuesday, but guess what? I'm having my party on Monday,

01:38.800 --> 01:44.000
so now my birthday's on Monday. And I think if Jay-Z is allowed to do that, I don't understand

01:44.000 --> 01:48.320
why I can't. Oh, my birthday cake's ready. Excuse me. Well, Travis is making a birthday cake for

01:48.320 --> 01:52.000
himself, and he's just gonna leave the podcast. Nothing sad about that. That's just a normal,

01:52.000 --> 01:55.600
regular thing folks do. That's just a normal thing that people do. Just folks. Gervin,

01:55.600 --> 01:59.520
your birthday is April 17th. Right, that's what I'm saying. It's not like November 8th rolled

01:59.520 --> 02:02.800
around. They're like, Gervin, time to come out. I was like, nah, I'm gonna lamp in here for like

02:02.800 --> 02:08.880
six more months. I got a pretty good situation up in here. I just set up my broadband internet

02:08.880 --> 02:14.160
access, so I'm gonna chill in the womb. I want to come out registered with social services.

02:15.520 --> 02:20.160
I want to come out with some knuckle hair. 87's gonna be a way, way, way better year than 86,

02:20.160 --> 02:22.960
so I'm just gonna chill in here. If you want to go ahead and get the paperwork going,

02:23.520 --> 02:28.320
and then I can just like slide out into that shit, that would be actually pretty dope for me.

02:28.960 --> 02:36.400
No, it is not Gervin's birthday, but it is my birthday. I turned 33. It's Jesus' year, everybody.

02:36.400 --> 02:43.520
This is the year I do miracles. And it's my birthday. I turned 30, so this is the beginning

02:43.520 --> 02:51.120
of my teaching. I have 30 to 33. Yeah, your teaching begins now. I gotta get up on that old

02:51.120 --> 02:56.960
rug cross. Important question, Travis, and I think I've posted this to you before,

02:56.960 --> 03:04.880
but is it dirty or flirty? You know, it's gonna have to be dirty 30, in which I forego all hygiene.

03:04.880 --> 03:12.800
Okay. Trav, do you feel, I don't know if you've postulated on this at all, but that's not the

03:12.800 --> 03:17.920
right word. Meditated on this. Ruminated. Postulized. Ruminated. Postulized. Meticulated.

03:19.600 --> 03:27.760
Do you feel weirdly younger at 30 than you did at 29? I do, and here's why.

03:27.760 --> 03:37.280
I have now gone from being the oldest 20-year-old in the group to being the youngest 30-year-old

03:37.280 --> 03:41.360
in the group. You know what I mean? So it's like I've entered a new chamber,

03:42.560 --> 03:46.800
and now I'm at the beginning of a different line. I guess externally that makes sense,

03:46.800 --> 03:52.880
but internally all your sperm is dying. Well, that's because of my hot pants.

03:52.880 --> 03:58.800
I'm sorry, your what? My hot pants. I wear heated pants.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.360
He's not giving those up for 30. Are they prescription?

04:02.400 --> 04:08.480
Well, I got cold bottom, and so I have to wear electric pants.

04:08.480 --> 04:13.200
Isn't that sort of like you're not gonna build an immunity to heat if you just keep-

04:14.160 --> 04:18.960
Griffin, I'm 30 at this point. My body's not gonna start producing its own butt heat at this point.

04:18.960 --> 04:21.520
I guess you've got a good point. This is My Brother, My Brother, Me.

04:21.520 --> 04:25.040
It's an advice show for the modern era. Let's get into the advice.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.560
Did we introduce ourselves by the way? I'm Justin McElroy. It's my birthday.

04:28.560 --> 04:32.960
I'm Travis McElroy. It's my birthday. Griffin McElroy, it's not my birthday,

04:32.960 --> 04:36.080
but you know what? I was born on Good Friday,

04:36.080 --> 04:40.640
and I think that that is probably why I just decided to delay it.

04:40.640 --> 04:44.240
Did you know that year, Good Friday, in 1987, they actually call it Great Friday?

04:44.240 --> 04:49.360
Exactly. I was born. It's a little birthday joke I like to tell when it's not my birthday,

04:49.360 --> 04:52.240
just to keep my spirits up. A couple of weeks ago,

04:52.240 --> 04:56.640
I found a note inside my locker at school. It said, this is roughly translated from Norwegian,

04:58.000 --> 05:02.160
been thinking about you a lot lately. Phone number. Call me. Heart shape.

05:02.960 --> 05:07.440
Well, I thought someone put this in the wrong locker or something, so I ignored it.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.920
How's your world view? That's your self-esteem, doc.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.400
Pretty good, huh? Not good.

05:12.400 --> 05:15.280
Today, on the 7th of November, I found another note in my locker,

05:15.280 --> 05:19.680
which said almost exactly the same thing. My problem is that I'm quite paranoid over

05:19.680 --> 05:22.880
stuff like this. I do not know how to respond. Please help, brothers.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.080
That's from paranoid in Norway. I totally get it.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.760
Absolutely right not to respond and be completely paranoid about the situation.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.520
You're right. Most spies are Norwegian,

05:33.520 --> 05:36.960
so if it's a spy thing you're worried about, then 100% right.

05:36.960 --> 05:42.000
I think you have one of two things to be paranoid about, and one more so than the other.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.160
One is that you have a young child vampirist who is trying to court and befriend you and

05:48.160 --> 05:52.080
ultimately use you for all of your days for her sinister purposes.

05:52.080 --> 05:56.320
And two is that it's some bullies and they're trying to entrap you into looking stupid.

05:56.320 --> 05:59.040
But I'm assuming this is in Norway, though,

05:59.040 --> 06:02.880
and so I think the vampire ass is probably a bit more likely.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.680
Dark for a super long time over there.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.560
Well, it's also possible that it's just like a really weird person.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.680
Yeah, but that seems unfunny.

06:11.680 --> 06:15.600
What if I think it might be a griff? It smells like a griff to me.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.800
This has like-

06:16.800 --> 06:18.160
You think like long con?

06:18.160 --> 06:21.280
I'm thinking full griff. It feels like the beginning of a griff.

06:21.280 --> 06:25.360
If they were like, I love it when you bring that briefcase full of money that you always

06:25.360 --> 06:27.280
carry with you. I hope you'll do that tomorrow.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.200
That's why it's a long con. You start really early and say, hey, seventh grader,

06:31.200 --> 06:35.440
I really like it when you leave a nickel every day underneath this rock, right?

06:35.440 --> 06:38.640
Because then you've got them for like 65 years.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.720
That is a long con.

06:40.720 --> 06:41.600
A lot of nickels.

06:43.520 --> 06:49.440
Maybe this is the next evolution of the I'm a Nigerian prince and I need $10,000 to secure

06:49.440 --> 06:52.800
the six million and I'll totally send you like 5.5 of that.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.720
Maybe they're decreasing their scope and scale a little bit.

06:58.720 --> 07:03.440
They're scaling and scoping it down just a bit and then they're going after our youths.

07:03.440 --> 07:07.360
And they're also lowering their expectation of the reward.

07:07.360 --> 07:11.040
And it's like instead of like $10,000, you know, blah, blah, blah, they just say,

07:11.040 --> 07:14.720
I really like the new Kings of Leon CD.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.800
And then they get a Kings of Leon CD?

07:16.800 --> 07:18.560
They get a bunch of Kings of Leon CDs.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.080
I don't think most people want one of those.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.640
I think most people want a lot. They're a very talented band.

07:24.640 --> 07:29.600
I don't enjoy their new stuff as much as youth and young manhood, but it's pretty okay.

07:29.600 --> 07:33.840
I feel like if someone's not going to leave a name or any sort of identifying features

07:33.840 --> 07:34.880
to this, I feel-

07:34.880 --> 07:36.320
They're trying to fuck you.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.160
They're trying to fuck you and not in like-

07:39.360 --> 07:40.400
With a capital F?

07:40.400 --> 07:41.520
The sex way.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.160
Yeah, this is bad news.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.760
I'd just throw it away, ignore it.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.240
Is it?

07:46.240 --> 07:48.320
Okay, wait, let me throw this out though.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.200
Counterpoint.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.400
Devil's advocate.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.840
Vampiros' advocate.

07:51.840 --> 07:52.080
Yeah.

07:52.800 --> 07:58.480
It sounds like Question Asker is a very shy, like low self-esteem person.

07:58.480 --> 08:04.240
So what if the person who's leaving this note is just another shy, low self-esteem person?

08:05.520 --> 08:06.160
I mean, I guess-

08:06.160 --> 08:08.160
It's so unactionable.

08:08.160 --> 08:12.560
It doesn't seem worth putting your cycles in it, unless you're willing.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.920
What if you're willing to do a sting?

08:17.360 --> 08:18.720
What if you're willing to-

08:18.720 --> 08:20.080
Leave the police.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.440
Park your car outside your locker-

08:21.440 --> 08:23.280
And then do a solo career.

08:23.280 --> 08:27.600
In a discreet, no, not a Gordon Sumner.

08:27.600 --> 08:32.800
A sting where you park your car outside your locker in a discreet place,

08:33.440 --> 08:36.400
and keep the headlights off and stuff, and just have a bunch of-

08:36.400 --> 08:40.000
I think they usually have a bunch of fast food wrappers in there and binoculars,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.240
and you just wait until-

08:42.240 --> 08:46.000
Martin Sheen falls from the roof of the building that you're parked outside next to,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.240
and splatters all over the ground like in Departed.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.440
That is actually how 90% of sting operations end.

08:51.440 --> 08:57.040
It's also important that there's another pair of people that come and relieve you

08:57.040 --> 08:58.960
after I think it's like 10 or 12 hours,

08:58.960 --> 09:01.760
and you guys share some clips about how nothing happened,

09:01.760 --> 09:05.520
and then moments after they start their shift, something goes down.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.760
Martin Sheen falls from the roof.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.160
That's why he put Martin Sheen pushed-

09:10.160 --> 09:14.400
It's such a bad gig that Martin Sheen ended up with falling out of windows, predominantly.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.040
I mean, at least-

09:16.480 --> 09:17.280
How was your shift?

09:17.280 --> 09:20.240
Oh, it's just fucking raining Martins and Sheens out here.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.280
But not Martin Sheen.

09:23.280 --> 09:27.040
There's been lots of Martin Smiths and lots of Steven Sheens.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.760
That's why Emilio Estevez changed his name,

09:29.760 --> 09:33.360
because he didn't want into the family business of falling out of windows.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.160
I'm not going to do it.

09:34.160 --> 09:34.720
I'm too busy.

09:34.720 --> 09:38.560
So one day this whole racket's going to be yours.

09:41.440 --> 09:44.640
You know, and Charlie Sheen's gotten really good at falling from high places.

09:44.640 --> 09:45.440
What's up?

09:45.440 --> 09:46.800
Oh, that was terrible, Travis.

09:47.920 --> 09:48.640
You know what?

09:48.640 --> 09:50.320
I'm actually going to switch my recommendation.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.320
Go ahead and give this number a call, because you miss it.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.640
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take,

09:55.600 --> 09:58.480
even if those shots will get you killed in an alley.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.640
You guys want Yahoo?

10:02.560 --> 10:05.360
This Yahoo was sent in by Ben Noteboom.

10:05.360 --> 10:05.920
Thanks, Ben.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.120
It's by Yahoo Answers user Eric, who asks,

10:10.240 --> 10:13.120
How do I go about destroying a cursed item?

10:14.720 --> 10:17.440
My sister is an atheist, and she has a Wiccan friend.

10:17.440 --> 10:20.560
Her friend gave my sister a stone that she apparently hexed,

10:20.560 --> 10:22.480
so that my sister would have better focus.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.200
That's not a hex.

10:25.200 --> 10:25.840
That's a blessing.

10:25.840 --> 10:26.640
Go on.

10:26.640 --> 10:30.400
Anyways, I want to destroy the stone because it was hexed using evil spirits,

10:30.400 --> 10:34.480
but I do not want to release anything into my life or my family's lives.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.240
How would I go about doing that?

10:37.360 --> 10:40.320
This is just coming from such a place of ignorance.

10:40.960 --> 10:41.280
Is it?

10:41.280 --> 10:45.200
Because it's clearly not evil spirits, because it's a blessing.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.760
You know, you see it every day where people are like,

10:49.760 --> 10:51.760
I've been given a totem to protect me.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.920
And everyone's like, oh, black magic.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.600
I'm like, no, that's pretty white magic.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.520
That's like as white as you get, you guys.

10:57.520 --> 11:02.000
Right, but I mean, there's still a spirit occupying.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.120
There's a spirit that's just like, hey, Martha, listen,

11:05.120 --> 11:06.800
you've been on Facebook long enough.

11:07.440 --> 11:08.720
You need to do your homework.

11:10.160 --> 11:14.400
This Latin's not going to worm its way into your brain without some effort.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.680
You got to work for it.

11:15.680 --> 11:18.080
Well, so then you say, I'm afraid of destroying the item

11:18.080 --> 11:21.280
and releasing the nerdy spirit out into the world.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.960
What if you, I mean, destroying it seems fine.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.200
I think if it was up to me, I would probably destroy it.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.160
But like, make sure it was in a ring of salt.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.320
That seems to be a popular.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.800
Right, but then what is, you just have this fucking salt ring

11:34.800 --> 11:36.800
that you can't, you can't like.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.480
No, you do it at a friend's house.

11:38.480 --> 11:41.040
All right, but then they have this salt prison.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.880
And as soon as like, I don't know if the cat gets in it,

11:44.880 --> 11:47.360
that buy cat, like that cat's done.

11:47.360 --> 11:50.320
I think you should ignore the curse part of it.

11:50.320 --> 11:53.840
And instead start asking the question, how do I destroy a stone?

11:53.840 --> 11:55.600
Cause I don't know the answer to that.

11:56.560 --> 12:00.400
I think if you, if you have any cursed items, stone or otherwise,

12:00.400 --> 12:03.760
I think you can just drop it off at the little exchange box

12:03.760 --> 12:05.600
that they have at Best Buy, you know, in the front

12:05.600 --> 12:07.120
where like you're supposed to put your printer cartridges

12:07.120 --> 12:08.400
and like cell phone batteries.

12:08.400 --> 12:12.160
I think they actually do have a slot for cursed items.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.600
But don't put it in there if they're out of the little baggies.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.920
Oh yeah, that's just common courtesy.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.880
I think the Geek Squad will be able to take care of that for you.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.880
And maybe they can install Windows on your,

12:22.880 --> 12:24.720
on your Windows PC for like $800.

12:25.520 --> 12:27.760
That does explain why the last time I was at Best Buy,

12:27.760 --> 12:32.000
I saw someone on the Geek Squad biting the head off a chicken

12:32.560 --> 12:35.120
and dumping its blood into a ring of stones.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.240
Oh no, that's to fix a virus on a Mac.

12:38.240 --> 12:42.480
And then charging $800 to put Windows on your PC.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.400
To literally put a disk in a disk drive

12:44.400 --> 12:46.960
and then press the go button on Windows.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.360
There's a big button that says, go for Windows?

12:49.360 --> 12:50.160
Yes or no?

12:50.160 --> 12:51.520
And if you click no, it's like, are you sure?

12:51.520 --> 12:53.360
Cause like you bought the Windows already

12:53.360 --> 12:54.560
and this is a Windows computer.

12:55.200 --> 12:58.000
We can just do this for you cause it's like a CD.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.640
$800 service.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.840
Thanks Geek Squad.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.680
Couldn't have done it without you.

13:03.680 --> 13:05.360
Don't know what I'd do without you in my life.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.920
Which one of you is a secret agent?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.520
You have to tell me legally.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.120
Which one of you has the intersect in your head?

13:12.960 --> 13:13.920
You have to tell me.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.160
You have to tell me by law or else it's entrapment.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.720
Why can't your sisters pound on some ginkgo?

13:24.320 --> 13:25.520
Yeah, that could work.

13:25.520 --> 13:29.600
I don't think ginkgo biloba's got like evil spirits in it, natively.

13:30.480 --> 13:33.040
I bet you, I mean the damage is done.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.720
They have the cursed item now.

13:36.720 --> 13:40.480
Am I crazy to say that like if his sister's an atheist,

13:41.280 --> 13:44.960
doesn't that mean she doesn't believe in like curses

13:44.960 --> 13:47.840
and blessings and hexes and spirits and shit?

13:50.320 --> 13:50.720
Yeah.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.520
I mean like by definition as an atheist.

13:53.520 --> 13:57.120
You don't have to believe in ghosts to have sex with one.

13:57.120 --> 13:57.760
You know what I mean?

13:58.880 --> 13:59.680
I mean, that's true.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.320
You don't have to believe in a ghost

14:02.320 --> 14:04.880
in order to have it be having sex with you.

14:04.880 --> 14:08.320
Yeah, I don't believe in guns, but I still don't want one in my house.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.840
You don't agree with guns.

14:09.840 --> 14:12.000
You believe that guns exist.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.760
Okay, you're getting into the semantics here.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.040
You may not believe in guns,

14:15.040 --> 14:19.520
but you can still definitely be shot to death by one is what I'm saying.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.400
That's what I'm saying.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.040
I think we're all on the same page.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.160
I don't know why we're arguing.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.000
Yeah, you're right Griffin.

14:26.000 --> 14:26.640
This is silly.

14:27.520 --> 14:28.720
Let's move on to another question.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.120
I've recently been meeting a lot of new people

14:31.120 --> 14:34.400
and you guys ever forget you have a coffee

14:34.400 --> 14:36.640
and then it just like, oh, I feel tired.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.760
And then you remember that you made a coffee before the show.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.880
Yeah, what's even worse is when you've just gotten in your car

14:42.880 --> 14:44.560
and driven like two blocks away from your house

14:44.560 --> 14:46.400
and going, shit, I poured a cup of coffee.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.680
I made that coffee.

14:48.240 --> 14:51.600
I hate it when you forget that you're in the middle of reading a question

14:51.600 --> 14:54.160
on a widely syndicated comedy podcast

14:54.160 --> 14:56.560
and instead just talk about something else.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.520
You ever notice?

14:58.640 --> 15:00.320
By the way, I'm 33, Griffin.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.480
This is the beginning.

15:02.480 --> 15:03.840
From here, it's all downhill.

15:03.840 --> 15:07.920
It's all like, you know what I like, vanilla tootsie rolls.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.120
That's the phase of this show we're going into.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.120
I watched CBS Sunday Morning this morning,

15:13.120 --> 15:14.240
which I really shouldn't do

15:14.240 --> 15:15.920
because more often than not, it makes me angry.

15:17.040 --> 15:20.080
They had an opinion section that was delivered

15:20.080 --> 15:22.880
by contributing editor Paula Poundstone

15:22.880 --> 15:25.200
and it made me want to eat a sword.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.440
It made me want to stab a sword down through my stomach.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.080
Is Paula Poundstone the new Andy Rooney?

15:30.080 --> 15:31.040
Is that the thing?

15:31.040 --> 15:35.200
I think that she experienced the quickening upon his death

15:35.200 --> 15:38.240
and got on there like, I think Obamacare is going to work

15:38.240 --> 15:41.200
because once YouTube didn't work and I got it to work,

15:41.200 --> 15:42.400
Poundstone out!

15:42.400 --> 15:46.400
It was like, that was three minutes of my life, Paula Poundstone.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.600
I'm never getting that back.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.040
I do love your bow tie though.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.000
Man to that.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.360
Anyway, I've been recently meeting a lot of new people

15:53.360 --> 15:55.200
and in an attempt to make conversation,

15:55.760 --> 15:57.280
they've been asking me, what's your story?

15:57.280 --> 16:00.480
I have a hard time talking about myself sometimes.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.640
So how am I supposed to respond to that question?

16:03.200 --> 16:07.040
Do they really want a summary of my life up until this point?

16:07.040 --> 16:08.960
What do I say when someone asks me that?

16:08.960 --> 16:10.880
That's from Flustered in Philly.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.160
What's your story?

16:12.160 --> 16:13.600
The Hobbit, what's yours?

16:13.600 --> 16:16.640
That seems weirdly, doesn't that seem weirdly antagonistic?

16:16.640 --> 16:21.120
It's like something like a hard-boiled cop asks someone

16:21.120 --> 16:22.640
in a movie like, what's your story?

16:22.640 --> 16:23.840
What'd you show I toots?

16:24.880 --> 16:26.080
Start singing Canary.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.440
Start singing Canary.

16:27.440 --> 16:28.960
Come clean, Maroney.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.360
Do you think that that question is giving rise

16:31.360 --> 16:32.880
in this generation?

16:32.880 --> 16:36.480
Because traditionally what you would ask is,

16:37.520 --> 16:38.880
what do you do for a living?

16:38.880 --> 16:42.400
And that question has become this thorny bramble bush

16:42.960 --> 16:45.840
to navigate with today's youths.

16:45.840 --> 16:49.440
Because most youths, and by youths, I mean people my age,

16:49.440 --> 16:51.200
we don't know what the fuck we're doing.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.000
You know what I mean?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.040
None of us know.

16:53.040 --> 16:57.040
I feel like what's your story falls somewhere

16:57.040 --> 17:01.040
between the weird question of either what's your deal,

17:01.040 --> 17:03.360
which I feel is super antagonistic,

17:03.360 --> 17:07.040
and you are, which is really aloof and elitist.

17:07.040 --> 17:10.000
So what's your story is kind of right between those two,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.240
and it makes you seem both kind of a dick

17:12.240 --> 17:14.160
and kind of a douche at the same time.

17:14.160 --> 17:18.320
But more importantly, dick douche, you can, it's-

17:18.320 --> 17:20.080
Hi, dick douche, what's your story?

17:20.080 --> 17:23.760
More importantly, though, if someone asks you,

17:24.480 --> 17:26.720
and by you I mean the youths of my generation,

17:27.600 --> 17:31.040
generation, what are we now, like delta?

17:31.840 --> 17:34.880
If they ask you, they ask a delta,

17:34.880 --> 17:36.720
like what's your story?

17:36.720 --> 17:38.880
And you can say, I've been thinking about getting

17:38.880 --> 17:41.360
into artisanal beekeeping.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.200
You can't use that answer when somebody asks you

17:43.200 --> 17:46.000
what you do for a living, because you don't do it yet.

17:46.000 --> 17:46.560
You know what I mean?

17:46.560 --> 17:50.720
I actually, I hate the what do you do for a living question,

17:50.720 --> 17:54.720
because here's what I do.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.400
I write about video games on the internet,

17:56.400 --> 17:58.160
and I do a comedy podcast.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.840
I do two comedy podcasts.

17:59.840 --> 18:03.040
There is a very high probability that I am going to have

18:03.040 --> 18:05.600
to explain as part of my job description

18:05.600 --> 18:07.920
some core concepts to the person I'm talking to,

18:07.920 --> 18:09.520
specifically their ages above 50.

18:09.520 --> 18:14.320
Or even more insulting, you have to find a way to intimate

18:14.320 --> 18:17.520
that yes, you earn a living wage doing this thing.

18:17.520 --> 18:20.160
It's not some joke job, you know what I mean?

18:20.160 --> 18:23.040
Sydney's grandfather until, I mean,

18:24.160 --> 18:28.080
probably until we launched Polygon in the beginning of 2012,

18:29.600 --> 18:31.280
still asked me when I was gonna get a job.

18:32.160 --> 18:35.680
I mean, I fully, fully was employed

18:35.680 --> 18:37.680
at several different locales at that point,

18:37.680 --> 18:40.240
and still was curious when I was gonna get

18:40.240 --> 18:41.360
into the working world.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.200
But don't you think that that is like becoming,

18:43.200 --> 18:46.960
especially for people our age and younger,

18:46.960 --> 18:49.680
becoming like more of the norm and less of the exception?

18:49.680 --> 18:50.880
Where it's like, oh, what do you do?

18:50.880 --> 18:53.760
Like, oh, I work for an independent brewery.

18:53.760 --> 18:57.280
So many, first of all, that's an awesome, awesome job,

18:57.280 --> 18:58.240
a venerable craft.

18:59.840 --> 19:04.640
Everybody, our whole world of Generation Delta

19:04.640 --> 19:08.320
would be fixed in a second if everyone would get

19:08.320 --> 19:10.240
on that micro tip, where he's like,

19:10.240 --> 19:12.560
everybody needs to go learn some fucking skills.

19:12.560 --> 19:13.840
And I listened to him.

19:13.840 --> 19:17.520
I hear him on the Bill O'Reilly talk show, radio program.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.120
And he's like, everybody needs to go out there

19:19.120 --> 19:20.320
and learn how to plumb.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.760
Because if you knew how to plumb,

19:21.760 --> 19:24.480
you'd be fucking set for life.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.560
And if we did that-

19:26.560 --> 19:28.080
The motherfucker went before Congress.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.160
Went before Congress, like, and he's like,

19:30.160 --> 19:31.920
you motherfuckers learned to plumb.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.080
Learned to plumb, you dumb shits.

19:34.080 --> 19:38.080
Name any problem in politics, American politics right now,

19:38.080 --> 19:40.960
that wouldn't be fixed if everybody knew a trade craft

19:40.960 --> 19:42.160
that they could profit off of.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.840
Like, everybody needs health insurance.

19:43.840 --> 19:44.960
Like, if you knew how to plumb,

19:44.960 --> 19:47.120
you'd be fucking making bank.

19:47.760 --> 19:48.880
And you could just like pay

19:48.880 --> 19:52.400
for whatever elective procedures you want or need.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.960
And people ask you, what's your deal, plumber?

19:54.960 --> 19:56.000
Booyah!

19:56.000 --> 19:56.720
You know what I mean?

19:56.720 --> 19:58.240
Like, it would be so easy.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.640
I have an actual real world skill.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.520
I can do a thing.

20:01.520 --> 20:02.080
Oh, what's your deal?

20:02.080 --> 20:02.800
I can do one thing.

20:02.800 --> 20:03.600
Hey, man.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.440
That's the best thing about my stupid job

20:05.440 --> 20:07.040
is that I get to say I'm a carpenter.

20:07.040 --> 20:07.440
I'm a carpenter.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.840
And if I don't feel like saying theatrical carpenter-

20:09.840 --> 20:10.960
Hey, I'm in a hurry.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.360
Summarize yourself in a phrase if you can.

20:13.360 --> 20:13.840
Oh, me?

20:13.840 --> 20:14.560
I'm electrician.

20:15.760 --> 20:16.480
Get out of here.

20:16.480 --> 20:17.120
I'm done.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.240
I'm done already with you.

20:18.240 --> 20:21.600
I'm gonna bookmark you in my head, Chad, electrician.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.880
Oh, that's Chad the electrician.

20:23.920 --> 20:26.960
I need some work done and I have lots of money

20:26.960 --> 20:28.560
and I need electric work done.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.240
I'm gonna continue supporting him.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.200
Now, here's the thing.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.760
The other side of that, though,

20:33.760 --> 20:36.560
is that when they go, okay, Travis, carpenter,

20:36.560 --> 20:38.000
then later when they're like,

20:38.000 --> 20:41.200
I have this table that needs fixed.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.720
Oh, Travis is a carpenter.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.240
The nice thing about telling someone

20:44.240 --> 20:45.920
that you're a small batch barrel maker,

20:46.560 --> 20:49.280
no one's ever gonna call you to come fix their barrels.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.960
Yeah, I guess if you don't want money,

20:50.960 --> 20:52.640
what are you talking about?

20:52.640 --> 20:55.040
No, but I don't like freelance carpent.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.840
I don't think carpent is the-

20:59.040 --> 20:59.920
But I'm a carpenter.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.440
I'm really more of an edutainer.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.440
That's what I'm gonna start telling people.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.200
Me, I'm an edutainment.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.400
I like to cross the bridge between education

21:12.400 --> 21:14.560
and entertainment as an edutainer.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.440
That's what I do.

21:15.440 --> 21:21.120
I feel like Jindel is entire, everybody I know.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.440
Hi, Jindel, what's your story?

21:23.440 --> 21:26.720
Everyone, every dick douche Jindel

21:26.720 --> 21:31.760
is somehow in the business of online publishing.

21:32.640 --> 21:35.600
Everybody in our fucking world,

21:35.600 --> 21:38.480
except for the guy who comes and fixes my pipes

21:38.480 --> 21:42.240
when they break, is in the business of online publishing.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.000
And at a party when someone says,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.640
what aspect of online publishing are you involved in?

21:47.200 --> 21:48.000
You can't be like,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.320
oh, I lead a creative consulting marketing.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.320
So do you think when they're asking what's your story,

21:52.320 --> 21:55.200
they're literally asking what story did you online publish?

21:55.200 --> 21:55.760
Yes.

21:55.760 --> 22:00.080
Oh, I did 10 best pictures of cats in mason jars.

22:00.080 --> 22:00.960
Oh, I remember that.

22:00.960 --> 22:01.920
Great work.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.320
Hey, this guy did the cats in mason jars post.

22:04.320 --> 22:04.800
That was great.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.680
Oh, I love that.

22:07.680 --> 22:08.160
You remember him?

22:09.200 --> 22:12.240
He's got the really small, really, really sick cat

22:12.240 --> 22:13.600
that's like super famous.

22:14.160 --> 22:14.800
Is he around?

22:14.800 --> 22:15.840
No bones.

22:15.840 --> 22:16.640
No bone cat.

22:16.640 --> 22:18.320
Oh, I remember no bones.

22:18.320 --> 22:19.120
He's great.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.600
I feel like the less you can tell someone the better.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.320
Like, I think you should try to keep it close.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.280
What's your story?

22:25.280 --> 22:26.000
Classified.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.160
No, I mean, give him something.

22:28.160 --> 22:31.360
Say, I grew up in the hills.

22:31.360 --> 22:33.520
Now I'm in the city just trying to make my way.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.040
I dabble.

22:35.040 --> 22:35.840
I dabble.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.240
I grew up in the marshes and then I lived in the mountains

22:38.240 --> 22:41.440
for a while and then the swamps and I'm just-

22:41.440 --> 22:42.880
Spent a little time in the glen.

22:42.880 --> 22:46.160
I'm just naming Magic the Gathering energy card types now.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.600
That's what I do for a living.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.280
I collect magic cards for a living.

22:51.280 --> 22:53.200
There probably is somebody making a living doing that

22:53.200 --> 22:55.280
and they have to explain that shit at parties.

22:55.280 --> 22:56.880
Dude, give it up.

22:56.880 --> 23:00.160
Give it up and learn how to like clean gutters or something.

23:00.160 --> 23:00.880
This is what I'm saying.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.800
I think we need an encyclopedia of non-offensive job titles

23:04.800 --> 23:06.720
that are all like euphemism for what you do.

23:06.720 --> 23:07.600
It's like, what do you do?

23:08.400 --> 23:12.320
I've got a huge assortment of magic cards that I sell for a living.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.040
What do you do?

23:13.040 --> 23:14.320
I'm a trades collector.

23:14.880 --> 23:17.760
You know, something that like doesn't make any sense

23:17.760 --> 23:20.720
but when you say it, everybody goes, oh, okay.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.160
And it's like, what do you do?

23:22.160 --> 23:25.920
Oh, I make tiny models of World of Warcraft battlegrounds.

23:25.920 --> 23:26.960
What do you do?

23:26.960 --> 23:28.800
I'm a carpenter, right?

23:28.800 --> 23:32.560
And then somebody, if they care to, can go look in the encyclopedia,

23:32.560 --> 23:36.400
flip the card and go, well, they make models of World of Warcraft.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.240
I don't think it says that in the encyclopedia though.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.760
That was a crazy thing you just said.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.240
That is maybe the most nonsensical thing you've ever said on this entire program.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.560
It'll be a very Orwellian lifestyle

23:46.560 --> 23:50.560
in which everybody is just assigned a bullshit term for the real ass job.

23:50.560 --> 23:58.000
You're saying that we should boil our jobs down to the actual base mechanic.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.240
Like I should tell people I'm a typist and talker.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.320
At a party though and somebody says, what do you do?

24:04.320 --> 24:06.400
And you say online publishing, their response is gonna be,

24:06.400 --> 24:07.600
don't be an asshole.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.680
Like we're all in online publishing.

24:09.680 --> 24:10.720
Of course you are.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.000
Of course you're in online publishing.

24:12.000 --> 24:12.480
Who isn't?

24:13.440 --> 24:14.160
Asshole.

24:14.160 --> 24:17.440
I think that we have developed this reverse aristocracy

24:17.440 --> 24:20.080
where look around your office right now and then try,

24:20.080 --> 24:22.960
like look at anything and try and imagine with your brain

24:22.960 --> 24:24.240
how that thing got made.

24:24.240 --> 24:26.320
You can't, you fucking idiot.

24:26.320 --> 24:26.800
You can't.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.200
Someone else made it and they're laughing at you.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.680
They're laughing at you because they don't know how to do shit

24:32.400 --> 24:35.200
and they can introduce themselves really easily at parties.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.560
I make lamps.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.440
I'm a lampman.

24:38.000 --> 24:45.200
My entire understanding of the built world is drawn from 99% invisible.

24:45.200 --> 24:49.040
So what that means is that when I see an everyday object,

24:49.040 --> 24:53.200
I still have no idea how it was made,

24:53.200 --> 24:56.560
but I assume the person that created it was a beautiful soul

24:56.560 --> 24:58.960
that could teach me about something about life.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.720
Because that seems to be the way of things.

25:00.720 --> 25:03.840
We have ugly, stupid, live journal souls.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.240
And can I just throw this out?

25:06.240 --> 25:08.640
We do not appreciate those beautiful souls enough.

25:08.640 --> 25:09.680
Financially, I mean.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.760
Monetarily, not enough appreciation.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.040
They're doing fine though.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.480
That's what Mike Rose is saying.

25:14.480 --> 25:18.560
People can't make a living because there's three paid online publishing jobs

25:18.560 --> 25:23.680
and there's approximately 5.5 billion people scrambling for them right now.

25:23.680 --> 25:24.720
But you know what's up?

25:24.720 --> 25:27.040
My toilet's been clogged for like two years because nobody knows

25:27.040 --> 25:28.640
how to fucking deal with it anymore.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.320
Your toilet's been clogged for two years?

25:30.320 --> 25:31.040
That's what I'm saying.

25:31.040 --> 25:33.360
It's rough and tumble down here in Austin.

25:33.360 --> 25:36.800
Austin is the home of online publishing.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.680
Everybody in Austin.

25:38.400 --> 25:41.040
We don't have a government because people don't know how to govern.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.040
They know how to write blogs about government.

25:43.040 --> 25:45.440
Got a lot of HuffPo free contributors down here.

25:46.080 --> 25:48.800
We don't have anybody with any public speaking skills.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.440
It's a fucking mess.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.800
We don't have cops.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.960
We don't have cops that can enforce the laws that nobody's writing.

25:54.960 --> 25:58.800
You just have people that post like top 10, 15 worst crimes.

25:58.800 --> 25:59.040
Right.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.240
They'll go to Boston and a cop will beat the shit out of them

26:02.240 --> 26:05.040
and they'll record it and they'll put it up like, isn't this terrible?

26:05.040 --> 26:06.080
Yeah, it's terrible.

26:06.080 --> 26:08.080
I wish we had any cops in Austin.

26:09.840 --> 26:14.400
My house hasn't been burgled because nobody learned how to pick a fucking lock.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.800
Because nobody fucking knows how tumblers work.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.920
They know how tumbler works.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.360
Tumbler works but they don't know how tumblers work.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.720
It's a fucking joke.

26:20.720 --> 26:24.400
I'm quitting the podcast.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.080
I'm quitting online publishing and I'm going to learn.

26:27.040 --> 26:30.000
I'm going to go like fucking tan leather or something like that.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.520
I'm going to fucking figure it out.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.280
Can I just say how much I would watch that?

26:36.320 --> 26:38.240
Not like as a show but just day to day.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.200
Are you fucking saying?

26:39.200 --> 26:42.080
I would just sit and watch you try to learn to tan leather.

26:42.080 --> 26:45.120
You are, you're a part of the fucking problem Travis

26:45.120 --> 26:49.520
because if I start tanning leather and then like someone starts doing a blog about it,

26:49.520 --> 26:51.440
you're going to read the blog and you're not going to buy my leather goods

26:51.440 --> 26:52.080
and then I'm going to die.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.320
Griffin, I can build a goddamn chair from scratch.

26:54.880 --> 26:55.920
I'll race you.

26:55.920 --> 26:59.680
I'll make a chair entirely out of leather and you make a chair entirely out of wood

26:59.680 --> 27:03.040
and we'll see which one sells on Etsy first.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.920
And then I'll write a blog about it.

27:05.920 --> 27:07.440
And then I'll write a blog about it.

27:07.440 --> 27:08.880
It'll be like Julia and Julia.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.480
Was that movie called Julia Julia?

27:11.200 --> 27:12.800
Julie and Julia I believe.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.640
I think it was called Julie versus Julia.

27:16.320 --> 27:17.040
Battle Royale.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.160
Another question you think?

27:18.160 --> 27:21.280
Yes, I need to stop getting so worked up during this podcast.

27:21.840 --> 27:22.640
I got a lot.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.920
I got a lot of loss prevention professionals emailing us.

27:27.760 --> 27:30.880
Listen, I'm not saying I wasn't.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.160
I should clear this up.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.760
I wasn't saying that everyone should shoplift all the time.

27:35.760 --> 27:41.040
I was only saying I don't understand why everyone doesn't shoplift all the time.

27:41.040 --> 27:41.840
That's a skill.

27:41.840 --> 27:44.240
It is a victimless, crimeless crime.

27:44.240 --> 27:48.560
Specifically, if you don't get caught.

27:48.560 --> 27:53.200
If you don't get caught or even if you do, they can't do anything.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.120
Someone was saying that there's a, what is it?

27:55.120 --> 27:59.760
Shopkeepers privilege, which says that you are allowed to detain somebody

27:59.760 --> 28:01.840
who you think has shoplifted.

28:01.840 --> 28:05.040
And I say, good luck, sirs.

28:07.040 --> 28:08.960
Somebody sent us an email though that was great

28:08.960 --> 28:11.200
because it also reflected something that happened to me

28:11.200 --> 28:13.520
when I worked at Best Buy and this dude worked at Best Buy.

28:13.520 --> 28:17.280
And he said that they caught this kid shoplifting

28:17.280 --> 28:20.080
and told him to wait for the cops and he did.

28:20.880 --> 28:23.120
And he sat there for 30 minutes till the cops came

28:23.120 --> 28:25.040
and they were like, yeah, the CDs are in his bag.

28:25.040 --> 28:28.800
Cops break open his bag and inside his bag is a bag of cocaine,

28:28.800 --> 28:30.880
a bag of marijuana, a loaded gun.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.480
Oh my God.

28:32.480 --> 28:33.360
And the CDs.

28:36.240 --> 28:39.920
And the kid just fucking sat there and waited for a half an hour.

28:39.920 --> 28:43.360
The kid's like, listen, if you're gonna arrest me for the shoplifting,

28:43.360 --> 28:44.720
you can't arrest me for the drugs.

28:44.720 --> 28:45.760
That's Double Jeopardy.

28:45.760 --> 28:46.560
I know my rights.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.240
I watched 15 minutes of Double Jeopardy on Starz.

28:52.800 --> 28:53.920
I think I know the law.

28:54.480 --> 28:55.680
I know my rights.

28:55.680 --> 28:56.720
That was from James.

28:56.720 --> 28:57.360
Thank you, James.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.720
Thanks, James.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.320
That happened to me once where a kid came in

29:00.320 --> 29:02.080
and used a stolen credit card

29:02.080 --> 29:05.440
and then he tried to return those items for money.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.240
And that's when we got him

29:06.240 --> 29:08.160
because the cops came after he used the credit card.

29:08.800 --> 29:09.520
And so-

29:09.520 --> 29:10.320
Wait, that's a crime?

29:11.120 --> 29:12.480
Yeah, so he came in, bought the things,

29:12.480 --> 29:13.360
the cops came in and were like,

29:13.360 --> 29:16.960
hey, did somebody use a credit card to buy such and such and such?

29:16.960 --> 29:18.400
I was like, oh yeah, he did

29:18.400 --> 29:20.400
because he showed them to me on his way out.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.640
And then the kid walked back in like five minutes later,

29:22.640 --> 29:23.840
was like, you know, I don't need these.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.440
Can I return them for cash?

29:25.440 --> 29:27.520
And the cops and I are just like standing there and looking at him.

29:27.520 --> 29:28.720
So the cops just grab him.

29:29.520 --> 29:32.320
And then they're like, can we check your car?

29:32.320 --> 29:33.680
And the kid's like, oh yeah, sure.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.920
And his car's just full of stolen stuff.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.000
I don't want to have to steal things.

29:38.000 --> 29:49.360
And as such, I need some money for that.

29:49.360 --> 29:54.560
Our friend Warby Parker is revolutionizing the world of iCare.

29:55.360 --> 29:55.920
It's true.

29:56.560 --> 29:57.200
Don't laugh.

29:57.200 --> 30:01.040
I'm starting to think that Warby Parker is like Hulu Plus

30:01.040 --> 30:03.040
in that like everybody already has it.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.280
So it's like, it's like,

30:05.280 --> 30:08.000
because I see everybody on Facebook like just got my Warby Parker's in.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
And I know those people don't listen to our show.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.360
I'm saying they're already worldwide.

30:11.360 --> 30:12.160
And I don't know.

30:12.160 --> 30:15.440
I think we're kind of a drop in the bucket here, but let's do our best.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.440
Glasses shouldn't cost as much as an iPhone, guys.

30:17.440 --> 30:18.400
I've been saying this forever.

30:18.960 --> 30:21.520
Warby Parker from Warby Parker, our friend,

30:22.160 --> 30:24.160
he'll sell you prescription glasses starting at $95.

30:24.800 --> 30:28.800
That's including the lenses, including the lenses.

30:29.680 --> 30:33.920
They got an anti-reflective coating and an anti-glare coating.

30:33.920 --> 30:34.880
No cost to you.

30:34.880 --> 30:35.920
Don't even worry about it.

30:35.920 --> 30:38.160
That way if people glare at you, you can't see it.

30:38.160 --> 30:38.960
You can't see it.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.000
You can't glare back.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.800
Buying glasses online is easy and risk-free.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.240
Warby Parker, they got, okay.

30:44.240 --> 30:44.960
So here's the best part.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.000
They got a try on program.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.080
What they do is they, you pick five pairs.

30:48.080 --> 30:48.960
They ship them to you.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.200
You try them all on at the same time.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.400
And not the same.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.960
You always say that and it makes it sound like you're like

30:54.960 --> 30:59.680
inventing some sort of Dr. Seuss, like mega spectacles with 10 lenses.

30:59.680 --> 31:01.040
You pull them all at the same time.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.400
Then you can see through walls.

31:02.400 --> 31:03.200
What's up?

31:03.200 --> 31:04.400
Money well spent.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.480
And then you send back the one that you don't want.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.000
Keep the one that works for you.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.680
And you get to keep them for five days.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.400
You can show everybody.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.520
Have a big party.

31:11.520 --> 31:12.640
Have the worst party ever.

31:13.440 --> 31:14.400
Make people look at your glasses.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.200
Shortest party ever.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.960
This one, this one, this one, this one, or this one.

31:16.960 --> 31:17.440
This one?

31:17.440 --> 31:17.680
Cool.

31:17.680 --> 31:18.160
Bye guys.

31:18.720 --> 31:19.840
Thanks for coming.

31:19.840 --> 31:24.720
For every pair of glasses they sell, they distribute some to some people in need.

31:24.720 --> 31:28.720
So that's $95 prescription polarized sunglasses from $150.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.080
And so here's the deal.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.800
You visit warbyparker.com slash my brother.

31:32.800 --> 31:35.360
Choose your five home try on frames.

31:35.360 --> 31:39.920
When you're ready, you enter the promo code my brother at your final checkout.

31:39.920 --> 31:45.600
You order your prescription glasses, sunglasses, or reading glasses at warbyparker.com slash

31:46.480 --> 31:47.120
my brother.

31:47.120 --> 31:50.720
And when you use the promo code, it usually takes about 10 business days to get to you.

31:50.720 --> 31:54.000
With the promo code, you're going to get them in three business days.

31:54.000 --> 31:54.720
No big deal.

31:54.720 --> 31:55.680
It's just great.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.440
Oh, I'm hungry.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.200
Oh, I'm so hungry.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.200
I've never been this hungry before.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.480
Man, that really took a turn.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.240
Justin, do you want some salty?

32:06.240 --> 32:10.480
Do you want some salty, crusty, sugar, sugar flogs?

32:10.480 --> 32:13.520
Shove that junk in your urethra.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.040
I'm not interested in it.

32:15.040 --> 32:17.040
Ho ho's, no no's.

32:17.040 --> 32:19.120
Twinkies, forget about it.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.400
You want a big bowl of junkums?

32:20.960 --> 32:22.080
Junkums?

32:22.080 --> 32:22.880
Keepums.

32:22.880 --> 32:23.680
That's what I say.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.080
No, these are baked junkums.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.360
No, that's junk.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.400
What I need is-

32:28.400 --> 32:29.280
With holestra.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.960
A nature box.

32:32.800 --> 32:36.800
I'm excited that Nature Box is a sponsor because I was actually into the Nature Box game

32:37.360 --> 32:40.640
before they sponsored us and I was so excited to have them.

32:41.280 --> 32:42.000
Here's what you do.

32:42.000 --> 32:42.880
Let me give you the pitch.

32:43.600 --> 32:49.360
You go to naturebox.com and you fill a box up with healthy snacks.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.320
This is like really good stuff.

32:50.320 --> 32:54.160
They got french toast, granola, salted caramel pretzel pops.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.720
Those shits are out of control.

32:56.720 --> 33:02.320
I just had like this mango puffed rice kind of bites.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.840
Oh my god, they're insane.

33:03.840 --> 33:04.400
Delicious.

33:04.400 --> 33:08.240
And you can get them all in one box.

33:08.240 --> 33:09.760
You get a new shipment every month.

33:09.760 --> 33:11.120
If you want to choose your stuff, cool.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.880
If not, they'll choose it for you.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.560
And the shipping is free.

33:15.120 --> 33:15.920
Fantastic.

33:15.920 --> 33:20.000
And what's better is for being a listener of ours, okay?

33:20.640 --> 33:23.360
You're going to be able to get your first box half off.

33:23.360 --> 33:24.800
Oh, half off?

33:24.800 --> 33:26.000
Are you kidding me?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.800
Does that mean they only include half the food that you ordered?

33:28.800 --> 33:32.160
No, it just means the box is cut in half and stuff falls out one end.

33:32.160 --> 33:33.600
Yeah, that sounds shitty.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.600
Why would we give this shitty promo to people?

33:35.600 --> 33:36.640
This is a money thing.

33:37.680 --> 33:42.320
Yeah, so you go to naturebox.com and use the promo code MYBROTHER.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.600
That's promo code MYBROTHER and naturebox.com.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.760
You're gonna get that first box half off.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.520
It's really delicious stuff.

33:49.520 --> 33:50.720
And they have a huge selection.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.160
It's like, you know, they got salty stuff.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.360
They got sweet stuff.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.040
There's stuff that like individually wrapped bars.

33:55.040 --> 33:58.240
And all of it comes in like resealable packages.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.080
So like you can take it with you and like-

34:00.080 --> 34:01.600
Are you into umami flavors?

34:02.560 --> 34:03.280
They have that.

34:03.280 --> 34:04.640
I got a message for Steven Yee.

34:06.800 --> 34:07.840
Watch your fucking back.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.120
Love, Naturebox.

34:13.920 --> 34:14.800
No, Travis.

34:14.800 --> 34:15.280
What's my message?

34:15.280 --> 34:19.360
You're gonna open one of those nature boxes and it's gonna be full of anthrax bombs and vampire bats.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.440
This message is for Steven Yee.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.920
It's from the Archery Guild of Calamitous Intent.

34:23.920 --> 34:26.880
Uh, what better gift can we get the man who has everything

34:26.880 --> 34:29.280
than a personal message from your three favorite brothers?

34:29.280 --> 34:30.160
A crossbow?

34:30.160 --> 34:30.640
Perhaps.

34:30.640 --> 34:31.520
A falcon?

34:31.520 --> 34:32.160
Possibly.

34:32.160 --> 34:33.840
But we figured this would be a fitting gift

34:33.840 --> 34:37.360
after your impromptu live reading of the sexy Garfield fan fiction

34:37.360 --> 34:39.600
at Mel and Rob's birthday dinner last year.

34:39.600 --> 34:40.880
Happy birthday, Steve.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.240
May your day be full of bacon.

34:42.800 --> 34:46.000
Sounds to me like Steve ruined Rob and Mel's birthday

34:46.000 --> 34:47.920
and this is the punishment instead of a crossbow.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.880
I do not remember signing off on letting someone else read our shit out loud.

34:50.880 --> 34:54.320
Hmm. I do not remember licensing out that materials.

34:55.360 --> 34:59.040
You read it at Mel Brooks and Rob Dierdrich's birthday.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.680
Their combined party.

35:01.680 --> 35:05.120
Steve-o, uh, happy birthday and watch your fucking back.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.520
Griffin, we got another message?

35:07.520 --> 35:09.760
Yeah, uh, this one is for Bryn Boatman.

35:10.480 --> 35:13.200
It's from Evan Smale, who says,

35:13.200 --> 35:14.320
To my best friend.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.120
You done it.

35:15.120 --> 35:17.360
Happy 20th haunted birthday.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.680
Try not to get too spooked on your big day.

35:19.680 --> 35:22.400
Now something tells me this one was supposed to be Halloween themed

35:22.400 --> 35:27.600
and that we have slipped up, um, just a little bit.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.200
Let me try to alter it a little bit.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.160
To my best friend.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.200
You done done it.

35:31.200 --> 35:34.160
Happy 20th, um, pilgrim birthday.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.880
Try not to get too turquied on your big day.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.120
Maze, cornucopia.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.360
Happy 20th birthday birthday.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.280
Try not to get too born on your big day

35:45.280 --> 35:46.880
because then it's celebrating our birthdays.

35:46.880 --> 35:47.520
I like that.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.560
I'm Jesse Thorne.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.920
Bullseye is all about discovering the good stuff in culture

35:51.920 --> 35:55.120
that will do nothing less than change your life.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.800
You know, I'd never heard anything like it before.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.560
It'd be like seeing a new color,

35:58.560 --> 36:01.360
which I guess is music's like biggest asset

36:01.360 --> 36:02.560
is that you can hear new sounds.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.000
I'll probably never see a new color.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.280
I'll probably never experience like a new crazy taste,

36:07.920 --> 36:09.280
but I'll hear new sounds constantly.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.480
Culture picks, comedy, and in-depth interviews.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.840
It's the good stuff and just the good stuff in popular culture.

36:15.840 --> 36:19.120
Just the good stuff in popular culture every week on Bullseye.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.080
Farm wisdom.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.360
Waw, waw, waw, waw.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.120
Fah, ah, arm wisdom.

36:34.160 --> 36:37.520
Get a dubstep in your two-step farm wisdom.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.640
Oh shit.

36:39.440 --> 36:40.720
Get right out of town.

36:40.720 --> 36:43.280
I'd say that's one of the better ones you've done recently,

36:43.280 --> 36:46.400
but recently your game's been super shitty

36:46.400 --> 36:47.840
on the farm wisdom introduction.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.160
Give me some farm wisdom.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.280
Can I read this one?

36:53.280 --> 36:54.240
Yes, please.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.720
Male pigs that are going to be raised to be hogs,

36:56.720 --> 36:59.040
a pig over 120 pounds, didn't know that,

36:59.040 --> 37:01.760
so already learning shit from farm wisdom.

37:02.640 --> 37:04.400
Male pigs that are going to be raised to be hogs,

37:04.400 --> 37:06.800
a pig over 120 pounds, and eaten for meat

37:06.800 --> 37:08.000
must be castrated.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.000
If they aren't, the testosterone makes the meat taste disgusting.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.840
It's called boar taint.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.520
If you've ever eaten a wild hog

37:15.520 --> 37:17.120
that tastes really gamey and shitty,

37:17.120 --> 37:18.080
it's been tainted.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.440
That's the craziest farm wisdom.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.400
I, like, that changes my whole perspective on pigs.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.920
It makes me feel bad for eating them,

37:27.920 --> 37:29.040
I guess, kind of a bit.

37:29.600 --> 37:30.560
Not very much because, like,

37:30.560 --> 37:31.840
they're still goddamn delicious,

37:31.840 --> 37:34.240
but, like, to think that they have to live

37:34.240 --> 37:36.640
in terrible conditions and get they dicks cut off.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.920
It's not a good life they lead.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.520
Not a good life, not an especially-

37:41.520 --> 37:43.440
It's not their dicks, it's just their balls.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.960
They don't cut off their dick and balls.

37:46.960 --> 37:47.840
I guess that's a good point.

37:47.840 --> 37:48.720
I didn't think about that.

37:50.720 --> 37:51.920
Maybe we should cut that one out

37:51.920 --> 37:53.440
because it really is bringing me down.

37:55.040 --> 37:55.840
You guys want a yahoo?

37:56.800 --> 37:57.520
Absolutely.

37:59.280 --> 38:00.080
Oh, God.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.400
This one's going to be really tough to get through

38:02.400 --> 38:04.800
because it's sort of like,

38:04.800 --> 38:07.360
could God make an object that he couldn't move?

38:07.360 --> 38:08.080
Sort of thing.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.440
Like, one of those quandaries

38:09.440 --> 38:11.760
that wraps in around it on itself

38:11.760 --> 38:13.040
like an MC Escher painting.

38:14.480 --> 38:15.840
Sent in by Spencer Lee Curtis.

38:15.840 --> 38:16.400
Thanks, Spencer.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.640
It's by yahoo answers user Melissa who asks,

38:20.160 --> 38:23.600
My horse hates other horses.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.040
My horse is gentle and sweet,

38:27.040 --> 38:29.280
but his personality changes toward other horses.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.200
I feel absolutely awful when my horse

38:31.200 --> 38:34.320
tries to bite and scowl at horses walking by.

38:34.320 --> 38:36.640
He's kicked two horses at the barn I board at

38:36.640 --> 38:38.240
and people are starting to refer to him

38:38.240 --> 38:39.520
as the crazy one.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.720
I don't feel like there's much I can do to make him stop

38:42.720 --> 38:45.040
other than negative reinforcement when it happens.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.480
He's generally polite,

38:46.480 --> 38:49.840
but turns into an ugly monster when faced with other horse.

38:49.840 --> 38:50.720
Any ideas?

38:50.720 --> 38:52.080
Thank you for reading.

38:52.080 --> 38:52.480
You're welcome.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.800
Is it possible that your horse is actually a bear?

38:55.520 --> 38:55.840
And you're an idiot.

38:55.840 --> 38:56.800
Oh, good question.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.280
Is it possible this horse is a bear and you're an idiot?

38:59.280 --> 39:00.000
Better question.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.960
Is it possible that your horse thinks it's a bear?

39:02.960 --> 39:04.560
Does not realize it's a horse.

39:05.520 --> 39:06.480
Here's the only thing though.

39:06.480 --> 39:09.760
I do not think kicking is a bear's game.

39:09.760 --> 39:10.400
You know what I mean?

39:10.960 --> 39:11.360
Oh, no.

39:11.360 --> 39:13.200
It's important to note the horse thinks it's a bear,

39:13.200 --> 39:15.360
but it's never been around other bears

39:15.360 --> 39:17.440
or it knows nothing about bears.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.680
Then why would it does what it thinks bears would do

39:19.680 --> 39:20.640
in a given situation?

39:22.320 --> 39:24.800
It heard the word bear once and it's like,

39:24.800 --> 39:26.480
that sounds like something I could get into.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.800
Well, because the owner kept riding at bear back

39:28.800 --> 39:30.480
and it was like, oh, I get it.

39:30.480 --> 39:31.840
So I've got a bear back.

39:31.840 --> 39:36.720
This is a horse that has chosen to live its life whenever

39:36.720 --> 39:37.680
possible as a bear.

39:37.680 --> 39:40.560
It's a fuzzy and I think we should respect it.

39:41.520 --> 39:41.920
Hold on.

39:41.920 --> 39:45.840
You're saying you just dropped a lot of concepts on me.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.720
Baby, that horse is born that way.

39:48.720 --> 39:49.280
I need you to walk backwards.

39:49.280 --> 39:51.520
That horse is born that way and I respect it.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.320
You're saying that, okay,

39:54.320 --> 39:55.920
you're saying that within the animal kingdom.

39:56.480 --> 39:56.960
Okay.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.040
You're saying that within the animal kingdom.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.160
Take as slow as you need to.

40:00.160 --> 40:01.360
I'll walk you through it.

40:01.360 --> 40:03.840
This is, let's start just with the basic facts.

40:03.840 --> 40:06.000
I guess this is a horse we're talking about.

40:06.000 --> 40:06.720
Yeah, right.

40:06.720 --> 40:11.120
The horse sees other genuses of animals in the animal kingdom

40:12.240 --> 40:14.880
and it goes up to one of those genuses and makes a wish

40:14.880 --> 40:16.160
and says, make me a bear.

40:16.160 --> 40:19.760
I wish I was a bear because it's just seems like a pretty

40:19.760 --> 40:20.400
cool lifestyle.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.920
Like we've covered being,

40:21.920 --> 40:24.160
being into the furry community is not all about sex.

40:24.800 --> 40:25.280
Right.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.640
So you're saying this horse,

40:26.640 --> 40:31.760
I'm saying this horse wants to be a bear.

40:32.880 --> 40:35.360
So it acts like it thinks a bear would.

40:35.360 --> 40:37.600
It's important to know it's never come in contact with a bear.

40:37.600 --> 40:41.040
So this is all conjecture on this horse.

40:41.040 --> 40:44.640
Does it wear a surprisingly expensive bear suit?

40:44.640 --> 40:46.000
Like a, like a Tanooki suit.

40:46.560 --> 40:47.920
Yeah, it doesn't have money.

40:47.920 --> 40:48.960
Griffin, don't be stupid.

40:48.960 --> 40:49.600
Don't be an idiot.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.440
Horses can't get checks.

40:51.440 --> 40:52.480
What are you silly?

40:52.480 --> 40:52.800
They can't.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.840
That's an important part.

40:53.840 --> 40:54.480
I can't.

40:54.480 --> 40:57.920
Can I say that I'm a furry and then like show up to a furry con

40:57.920 --> 40:59.120
wearing like a t-shirt and jeans?

41:00.000 --> 41:00.320
Yes.

41:01.040 --> 41:02.320
Furries are not about your bank account.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.880
That's like, if you were, if you were a king,

41:04.880 --> 41:07.360
you're still a king even if you're not wearing your crown

41:07.360 --> 41:08.000
and your cape.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.440
It's not about the accessories.

41:09.440 --> 41:10.960
It's about what you have inside.

41:10.960 --> 41:11.760
Thank you, Travis.

41:11.760 --> 41:12.080
Yes.

41:12.080 --> 41:13.360
Exactly what Travis said.

41:13.360 --> 41:13.680
Okay.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.720
So can, if this horse wanted to be a dolphin,

41:17.760 --> 41:18.720
would he be a,

41:18.720 --> 41:20.160
That would be a squeaky.

41:20.160 --> 41:20.480
Okay.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.120
Is there one for every different animal?

41:23.120 --> 41:24.640
Or are we just talking about the texture?

41:24.640 --> 41:26.800
There's only one way to find out.

41:26.800 --> 41:27.840
Just keep asking.

41:28.640 --> 41:31.680
If, if it wanted to be a scorpion.

41:32.480 --> 41:33.120
That's a stingy.

41:33.120 --> 41:33.520
Stingy.

41:34.960 --> 41:35.920
If it wanted to,

41:35.920 --> 41:37.520
no, this is bullshit because I,

41:38.080 --> 41:39.360
if I wanted to be a horse,

41:40.000 --> 41:40.800
then I would still,

41:40.800 --> 41:43.040
I think I would still be classified as a furry.

41:43.040 --> 41:44.320
No, you would be everyone.

41:49.200 --> 41:50.480
Beautiful sons of bitches.

41:52.000 --> 41:52.960
I think maybe that's it.

41:52.960 --> 41:54.160
Maybe the horse just realized

41:54.160 --> 41:57.360
that it will never be classified as the majestic one

41:57.360 --> 41:58.560
or the pretty one

41:58.560 --> 41:59.520
or the graceful one.

41:59.520 --> 42:00.720
You're saying he's found,

42:00.720 --> 42:01.760
he's found his niche.

42:02.320 --> 42:02.560
Yeah.

42:02.560 --> 42:02.960
He was like,

42:02.960 --> 42:04.000
he's looking around and going,

42:04.000 --> 42:05.360
look at all of us.

42:05.360 --> 42:06.880
We are all the majestic ones.

42:06.880 --> 42:07.840
We are all the pretty ones.

42:07.840 --> 42:09.360
I'm going to be the fucking crazy one.

42:10.240 --> 42:11.200
But that's the thing.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.400
If I've learned anything

42:12.400 --> 42:15.600
from any horse-based entertainment medium,

42:16.560 --> 42:17.360
it is that you,

42:17.360 --> 42:19.600
that is the horse that you want to tame.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.840
And then it turns out to be the fucking dopest,

42:21.840 --> 42:25.360
the best, fastest, best, best racinist.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.280
Well, I think the difference is,

42:27.280 --> 42:29.920
is usually you look for like the stubborn one,

42:29.920 --> 42:30.880
the difficult way.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.200
You don't look for like the balls crazy one.

42:34.080 --> 42:34.640
You don't want,

42:34.640 --> 42:35.440
you don't look for the one

42:35.440 --> 42:36.960
that's going to try to eat your toes

42:36.960 --> 42:37.840
when you're not looking.

42:38.720 --> 42:40.640
That's not what Black Beauty was about.

42:40.640 --> 42:41.520
Now Black Beauty,

42:41.520 --> 42:43.040
I know that you just ate my baby,

42:43.040 --> 42:44.000
but God damn it,

42:44.000 --> 42:44.640
I'm going to ride you.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.560
I'm going to break that animal spirit.

42:48.560 --> 42:49.680
Horses can,

42:49.680 --> 42:51.040
this is an unpopular opinion,

42:51.040 --> 42:53.040
but horses can look kind of crazy.

42:53.040 --> 42:53.680
When they like,

42:53.680 --> 42:55.200
when they like open their lips up

42:55.200 --> 42:56.560
and show you those huge chompers

42:56.560 --> 42:57.840
and their eyes open wide,

42:57.840 --> 42:59.760
that is a scary, scary sight.

42:59.760 --> 43:01.520
And I saw in the Pecos Bill cartoon,

43:01.520 --> 43:02.160
they do this thing,

43:02.160 --> 43:03.600
like when they jump up in the air.

43:03.600 --> 43:04.800
You just said four words

43:04.800 --> 43:05.760
that didn't sound like words.

43:05.760 --> 43:06.640
What were they?

43:06.640 --> 43:08.080
The Pecos Bill cartoon.

43:08.080 --> 43:08.580
Okay.

43:09.280 --> 43:10.560
The horse jumps and they are like

43:10.560 --> 43:11.360
all four of its feet

43:11.360 --> 43:12.480
leave the ground at the same time.

43:12.480 --> 43:14.080
And it kind of like curves its back.

43:14.640 --> 43:17.200
And it looks like a fucking crazy ass like horse show.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.160
That's a cartoon, Travis.

43:18.720 --> 43:20.240
No, but like they do it in real life too.

43:20.240 --> 43:21.920
What if, what if the horse,

43:21.920 --> 43:23.920
that weird horse face curve was describing,

43:23.920 --> 43:25.600
what if that's their natural state?

43:25.600 --> 43:27.600
Like, and they just gussy it up

43:27.600 --> 43:29.120
for when humans are around.

43:29.120 --> 43:30.160
Well, that's the time they're working

43:30.160 --> 43:31.280
really hard to keep it together.

43:31.280 --> 43:33.120
I can't let my lips do that weird thing.

43:33.920 --> 43:34.720
It makes me look like

43:35.440 --> 43:37.120
the horse embodiment

43:37.120 --> 43:39.280
of a Robin Williams impersonation.

43:42.480 --> 43:43.760
That is what they look like though.

43:44.960 --> 43:45.760
This is the, this,

43:45.760 --> 43:46.800
we're joking about this

43:46.800 --> 43:47.920
because we don't want to answer

43:47.920 --> 43:49.840
the fucking like hard, hard question.

43:49.840 --> 43:52.560
We love horses so goddamn much.

43:52.560 --> 43:54.000
I think about them all day,

43:54.000 --> 43:55.440
especially in the shower.

43:55.440 --> 43:56.720
I got to ride one on my honeymoon

43:56.720 --> 43:57.840
and it was fucking glorious.

43:57.840 --> 43:58.800
That's what I'm saying, Travis.

43:58.800 --> 44:00.800
Was it familiar with you from your work?

44:00.800 --> 44:01.600
It was, it was like,

44:01.600 --> 44:02.800
oh, you're the horse advocate,

44:02.800 --> 44:03.520
Travis McElroy.

44:03.520 --> 44:05.440
We've read so much about in our horse case.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.120
I'll make sure not to destroy your balls

44:07.120 --> 44:08.720
and dick with my crazy spine.

44:10.960 --> 44:12.080
I've only ridden a horse once

44:12.080 --> 44:13.440
and it destroyed both my balls

44:13.440 --> 44:15.680
and my dick with its crazy, crazy spine.

44:15.680 --> 44:17.600
It was like, it was like riding

44:17.600 --> 44:19.280
that one Spinosaur.

44:19.280 --> 44:20.240
I think that was a dinosaur

44:20.240 --> 44:21.600
with the like crazy spine fin.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.240
Terrible, terrible for my situation.

44:25.600 --> 44:26.480
What were we talking about?

44:26.480 --> 44:27.360
If I've told you once,

44:27.360 --> 44:28.240
I told you a thousand times

44:28.240 --> 44:29.600
that was a motorcycle

44:29.600 --> 44:31.520
and you could say it was a dinosaur

44:31.520 --> 44:32.480
as many times as you want.

44:33.120 --> 44:36.080
This horse is actively hurting

44:36.080 --> 44:38.320
other beautiful, perfect horses.

44:39.520 --> 44:41.600
What do we, what do we do about that?

44:41.600 --> 44:43.360
Can you just sequester it?

44:43.360 --> 44:43.840
What do you mean?

44:44.400 --> 44:46.000
I mean, just like make it

44:46.000 --> 44:47.760
never see other horses again.

44:47.760 --> 44:49.600
A life without looking at horses,

44:49.600 --> 44:51.040
you might as well send it to hell.

44:51.680 --> 44:53.120
Oh, let me throw this out.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.320
Equus, blind it.

44:55.760 --> 44:57.520
That's a terrible, you understand?

44:57.520 --> 44:58.640
Well, no, then it can totally

44:58.640 --> 45:00.480
be around other horses, but don't worry.

45:00.480 --> 45:01.440
Oh, it would smell.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.120
Oh, I smell a fucking, I love-

45:03.120 --> 45:04.000
Cut its nose off.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.280
I blind it, cut its nose off,

45:05.280 --> 45:06.160
pull its teeth out.

45:06.160 --> 45:06.800
Oh God.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.080
What are you talking about?

45:08.080 --> 45:08.320
What?

45:08.320 --> 45:10.960
But then it's still gonna ride it majestically.

45:12.400 --> 45:14.400
You think any horse is gonna look anything

45:14.400 --> 45:16.400
but disheveled and resentful

45:16.400 --> 45:18.000
after that, this procedure

45:18.000 --> 45:19.360
that you're doing majestically.

45:19.360 --> 45:20.080
Sweet mask.

45:20.080 --> 45:21.440
It's gonna hear the horses.

45:21.440 --> 45:23.040
Gotta cut those ears right off there.

45:23.040 --> 45:23.840
Cut the ears off.

45:23.840 --> 45:25.520
It's still gonna wanna kick things,

45:25.520 --> 45:26.720
so those hooves gotta go.

45:27.840 --> 45:28.880
Come on, Torcy.

45:32.480 --> 45:34.080
Torcy, the torso horse,

45:34.080 --> 45:35.600
touch him and your wishes come true.

45:37.120 --> 45:38.080
I don't wanna touch,

45:38.080 --> 45:39.280
daddy, I don't wanna touch him.

45:39.280 --> 45:40.640
Don't make me touch him.

45:40.640 --> 45:41.520
Come on.

45:41.520 --> 45:42.320
Touch the goddamn horse.

45:42.320 --> 45:43.600
Packers got a hard game coming up.

45:43.600 --> 45:44.240
I need to win.

45:44.240 --> 45:46.560
Man, touch him, touch Torcy.

45:47.600 --> 45:48.720
Your mom's not gonna come back

45:48.720 --> 45:50.480
unless you touch Torcy for daddy, come on.

45:54.960 --> 45:55.760
Go ahead, child.

45:57.520 --> 45:58.480
How are you speaking to me?

45:58.480 --> 45:59.520
Your mouth is gone.

45:59.520 --> 46:02.400
I'm speaking to you through the Equestriaverse.

46:03.520 --> 46:04.480
Touch me, child.

46:04.480 --> 46:06.560
It's the only way your mother's coming back to daddy.

46:08.560 --> 46:10.160
No, I think Travis should be forced

46:10.160 --> 46:11.680
to leave its ears on

46:11.680 --> 46:13.600
because I want it to hear the things

46:13.600 --> 46:14.800
that people say about it.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.200
And that's to the pain.

46:18.720 --> 46:20.400
When the children walk by and whisper,

46:20.400 --> 46:22.000
dear God, what is that thing?

46:22.000 --> 46:22.480
What is that?

46:23.360 --> 46:24.960
I want their heads to be forever

46:24.960 --> 46:25.920
in its perfect ears.

46:29.280 --> 46:30.000
Poor Torcy.

46:32.800 --> 46:34.320
It could probably still survive, right?

46:35.440 --> 46:38.240
If you wanna see this fan art of Torcy,

46:38.240 --> 46:41.520
just draw a bean, draw a hairy bean.

46:41.520 --> 46:43.600
It still has most of its head.

46:43.600 --> 46:45.280
It's still gonna need a brain up in there.

46:46.880 --> 46:49.440
Draw a bean with a brain dangling off of it.

46:49.440 --> 46:50.160
Don't get me wrong.

46:50.160 --> 46:52.000
Horse's hearts are the biggest,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.080
most perfect, and wonderful hearts

46:54.080 --> 46:56.240
capable of more love

46:56.240 --> 46:58.320
than every human in the world combined,

46:58.320 --> 47:00.400
but it still needs some think meat in there

47:00.400 --> 47:01.600
to process.

47:01.600 --> 47:06.080
Can we store the brain inside Torcy's torso

47:06.080 --> 47:07.600
behind glass like Krang?

47:07.600 --> 47:10.080
Um, yes.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.760
Man, wouldn't that be great

47:11.760 --> 47:14.000
if they made Seabiscuit too with Torcy

47:14.000 --> 47:15.040
and he still somehow,

47:15.040 --> 47:16.880
I guess he just like rolled really fast

47:17.760 --> 47:18.880
and he won the big race.

47:18.880 --> 47:20.800
Just gotta give him something to chase,

47:20.800 --> 47:23.520
but he can't smell see or hear.

47:23.520 --> 47:24.960
Move, live, think.

47:24.960 --> 47:26.800
Bang a gong in front of him

47:26.800 --> 47:29.200
and hope that the vibrations steer him the right way.

47:29.200 --> 47:31.040
He would make a great bobsled though.

47:31.040 --> 47:32.640
That's for goddamn sure.

47:32.640 --> 47:34.400
My office had a Halloween party

47:34.400 --> 47:36.560
which resulted in a large bucket of candy

47:36.560 --> 47:39.040
being left over and set out in a common area.

47:39.040 --> 47:40.640
The next morning, all of the candy

47:40.640 --> 47:42.480
except for the Milky Ways were gone.

47:42.480 --> 47:44.240
A coworker claims to be the sole witness

47:44.800 --> 47:46.480
but doesn't want it to get out

47:46.480 --> 47:48.320
because that would create workplace tension

47:48.320 --> 47:49.920
between adults over candy.

47:51.840 --> 47:53.920
Should I press my coworker to snitch?

47:53.920 --> 47:57.440
This was probably $20 to $30 in good candy

47:57.440 --> 47:59.520
and this is not the first time it happened.

47:59.520 --> 48:00.880
That's from Snitch Witch.

48:01.760 --> 48:03.760
Oh man, how many times has that happened?

48:03.760 --> 48:05.120
The perfect crime.

48:05.120 --> 48:05.520
I know.

48:05.520 --> 48:06.560
Let me just throw this out.

48:06.560 --> 48:08.400
Who takes all the candy except Milky Ways?

48:08.400 --> 48:10.400
I know, Milky Ways basically the best candy bar,

48:10.400 --> 48:14.480
so whoever, I mean, I guess leaving that behind

48:14.480 --> 48:15.840
is such a huge clue

48:16.560 --> 48:17.680
because it's like who in the office

48:17.680 --> 48:18.640
doesn't like Milky Ways?

48:18.640 --> 48:20.880
Robert, Robert, god damn it.

48:21.760 --> 48:23.200
I knew it was you, Robbie.

48:23.200 --> 48:25.120
You fucked us for the last time, Robbie.

48:26.480 --> 48:30.720
Is that $20 to $30 pre-Halloween or post-Halloween?

48:31.760 --> 48:32.880
Because that goes way down.

48:32.880 --> 48:35.440
That's like down to like $10, $15 at Walgreens.

48:35.440 --> 48:37.360
Are you providing us with the price of the candy

48:37.360 --> 48:39.280
because you're thinking that they're gonna fence it?

48:39.280 --> 48:40.080
Because if that's the case,

48:40.080 --> 48:41.760
why wouldn't they just take the Milky Ways?

48:41.760 --> 48:45.920
No, there needs to be some reparations made.

48:47.680 --> 48:49.520
They need to provide everybody in the office.

48:51.200 --> 48:52.720
They employ 60 people,

48:52.720 --> 48:57.440
so they need to pay, I don't know, 30 to 50 cents per person.

48:57.440 --> 49:03.280
How much do you have to fucking love Butterfingers

49:03.280 --> 49:07.600
and Snickers and Twix that it is worth $20 to you?

49:07.600 --> 49:10.560
The possibility that one of your co-workers

49:10.560 --> 49:15.120
will have a visual of you like with a duffel bag

49:15.120 --> 49:17.360
just raking candy into it except for,

49:17.360 --> 49:19.040
oops, no, a Milky Way got in there.

49:19.040 --> 49:20.400
I gotta filter that back out.

49:20.400 --> 49:23.680
I would actually pay $20 to see an adult person doing that.

49:23.680 --> 49:24.720
I think it would be worth it.

49:24.720 --> 49:27.360
I think what you're missing out on is

49:27.360 --> 49:29.680
that it's the principle of the thing

49:29.680 --> 49:31.360
and not the monetary value.

49:31.360 --> 49:33.840
Because if it were me, if it were my workplace,

49:33.840 --> 49:36.160
A, I would be the one who had stolen the candy.

49:36.160 --> 49:39.120
But B, the problem is is at that point,

49:39.120 --> 49:41.200
it's like that was all of our candy

49:41.200 --> 49:44.160
and Steve yummied it down.

49:44.160 --> 49:46.880
Yeah, but you're 30 now, Travis,

49:46.880 --> 49:48.640
and I have a hard truth for you to accept in this

49:48.640 --> 49:50.640
that you can't eat candy anymore.

49:50.640 --> 49:51.920
Justin will tell you all about it.

49:51.920 --> 49:54.720
Once you hit 30, you can't eat candy anymore.

49:54.720 --> 49:56.000
Because it gums up the works?

49:56.000 --> 49:58.640
It gums up the works so, so bad.

49:58.640 --> 50:00.480
Well, I know you can't do Starbursts,

50:00.480 --> 50:03.040
but I figure a York Peppermint Patty isn't gonna mess it up.

50:03.040 --> 50:06.240
I'm 33 now, and I am to a point where,

50:06.960 --> 50:10.240
and this has just started to happen,

50:10.240 --> 50:13.120
but I start to feel weird about eating candy.

50:13.120 --> 50:13.440
Yeah.

50:13.440 --> 50:16.240
It seems like, I don't know, I've got some candy here

50:16.240 --> 50:19.440
and it seems like it's for kids now, I guess.

50:19.440 --> 50:21.840
Good news is, Travis, you mentioned Starbursts,

50:21.840 --> 50:23.680
you can't eat Starbursts anymore,

50:23.680 --> 50:27.200
but can I suggest this substitute of Metamucil Fiber Chews?

50:28.960 --> 50:31.360
Just as good, and they keep your pipes full.

50:31.360 --> 50:32.720
What are you into, Skittles?

50:32.720 --> 50:34.480
Skittles aren't gonna do you anymore,

50:34.480 --> 50:36.560
but how about these Centrum Daily Vitamins?

50:37.840 --> 50:39.920
They're like Skittles that you have to eat

50:39.920 --> 50:42.720
or else you'll die because you're 30 years old now,

50:43.520 --> 50:45.520
and your body just won't fix itself anymore

50:45.520 --> 50:46.240
the way it used to.

50:47.200 --> 50:50.160
You gotta keep filling it with nutrients and supplements.

50:50.160 --> 50:52.080
I'm sad now.

50:52.080 --> 50:52.640
Well, that's-

50:52.640 --> 50:53.840
I wish I hadn't gotten old.

50:54.800 --> 50:55.040
I know.

50:55.040 --> 50:56.480
There's nothing you can do about it.

50:56.480 --> 50:57.440
Well, not now.

50:58.880 --> 51:00.800
You have no idea what it's like being the youngest brother.

51:00.800 --> 51:04.240
It's like I have two portraits of myself

51:05.040 --> 51:07.280
that a wizard painted and they're both,

51:07.280 --> 51:10.000
I can watch them both getting older in front of me

51:10.000 --> 51:11.440
and it's like, oh, I'm gonna be that,

51:11.440 --> 51:12.960
and then I'm gonna be that!

51:12.960 --> 51:17.280
It's really fucking terrifying.

51:17.280 --> 51:20.560
Why does one of your portraits have a beard?

51:20.560 --> 51:23.680
Because I have high hopes one of these days

51:24.400 --> 51:25.440
it's gonna happen for me.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.120
I'm gonna start producing.

51:27.680 --> 51:29.120
Griff, do you have a Yahoo for us?

51:29.120 --> 51:29.840
Sure.

51:29.840 --> 51:32.080
This Yahoo was sent in by Steven Emrick.

51:32.080 --> 51:32.720
Thanks, Steven.

51:33.360 --> 51:35.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Diddy who asks,

51:36.720 --> 51:38.400
best Subway meat sandwich?

51:39.680 --> 51:41.520
I've been wanting to try something new.

51:41.520 --> 51:43.520
I love cold cuts and cheeses.

51:43.520 --> 51:45.440
Not a fan of turkey or chicken subs.

51:45.440 --> 51:48.560
What combination of meats and cheeses could I get?

51:48.560 --> 51:49.680
That would be good.

51:49.680 --> 51:50.960
And on what type of bread?

51:53.120 --> 51:55.520
Have you tried the pâté with quail eggs?

51:57.440 --> 51:59.360
Order that, see what kind of reaction you get.

51:59.360 --> 52:01.280
Is there a way to,

52:02.880 --> 52:05.920
you know how like there's all those online publishing

52:06.720 --> 52:09.760
things going around of like how to hack Chipotle

52:10.240 --> 52:13.600
and like really, really sad ways of getting like

52:13.600 --> 52:16.880
getting like some extra guac, you know what I mean?

52:16.880 --> 52:19.200
Like ask for a medium sized tub of guac

52:19.200 --> 52:20.880
and then have them put it in a large container

52:20.880 --> 52:23.760
and you'll get 1.5 extra ounces of guac.

52:23.760 --> 52:24.640
I was like, wow, man.

52:25.840 --> 52:27.200
That's a lot of steps to go through

52:27.200 --> 52:28.320
for just a little bit extra guac.

52:28.320 --> 52:33.360
Is there a way to hack Subway to get bigger, better,

52:33.360 --> 52:34.960
beefier, more robusto sandwiches?

52:34.960 --> 52:36.960
Get the cookies on the sandwich.

52:37.840 --> 52:40.720
You're saying when they ask what toppings do you want?

52:40.720 --> 52:41.760
Yeah, what topping?

52:41.760 --> 52:43.840
You say, I want a large soda on there.

52:43.840 --> 52:44.960
Yeah, can I get a second?

52:44.960 --> 52:47.840
Crunch up some of the Lay's potato chips onto the sandwich.

52:47.840 --> 52:51.600
Can I get a second sandwich inside that sandwich, please?

52:51.600 --> 52:53.840
And then you can keep doing that forever

52:53.840 --> 52:55.680
until the universe is all sandwiches.

52:57.120 --> 52:58.640
Do you guys, what do you guys get at Subway?

52:58.640 --> 52:59.920
What's your Subway jam?

52:59.920 --> 53:01.520
I haven't been to a Subway in so long

53:01.520 --> 53:02.800
because do you know why?

53:02.800 --> 53:04.880
Because those places fucking stink.

53:04.880 --> 53:06.560
They stink so bad.

53:06.560 --> 53:10.320
There's a combination gas station and Subway by my house.

53:10.320 --> 53:10.960
Oh my God.

53:10.960 --> 53:13.920
Every time I walk into the gas station, it smells like sick.

53:13.920 --> 53:15.360
It smells like someone's vomit.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.440
Yeah, being Subway adjacent is terrible.

53:17.440 --> 53:19.280
I used to work at the country's best yogurt

53:20.080 --> 53:23.440
and it really just, it wasn't a brand name for us.

53:23.440 --> 53:24.720
It fucking meant something.

53:25.680 --> 53:28.720
But that country's best yogurt was right next door to a Subway

53:28.720 --> 53:30.960
and we would get a little bit of stink through the vents

53:30.960 --> 53:33.040
and then you would go in on your lunch break

53:33.040 --> 53:35.840
because there was nothing else to eat in a 3.5 mile radius.

53:35.840 --> 53:38.400
So you would go into the Subway and I would get my,

53:38.400 --> 53:42.240
you know, whatever sandwich I could get for $2.50

53:42.240 --> 53:43.760
because I was broke like a bad joke.

53:43.760 --> 53:44.960
And then you would come back and be like,

53:44.960 --> 53:46.640
oh, you went to Subway, I can tell

53:46.640 --> 53:49.040
because you carried it with you, the smell of it.

53:49.040 --> 53:50.400
It gets in your fucking clothes.

53:50.400 --> 53:53.040
You got a pig pin-esque cloud of Subway stink around you.

53:53.040 --> 53:57.520
It's like every Subway comes with its own like methane leak.

53:57.520 --> 53:59.760
Like that's part of the, in order to franchise it out,

53:59.760 --> 54:01.600
it's like, let's see, you got a sandwich station,

54:01.600 --> 54:03.600
you got a hood to prevent people from like sweating

54:03.600 --> 54:06.080
and bleeding and snotting into the meats, that's great.

54:06.080 --> 54:07.920
And let's just go ahead and break this pipe.

54:07.920 --> 54:08.960
All right, you're good to go.

54:08.960 --> 54:11.200
Have fun and sell lots of Sammies.

54:12.320 --> 54:14.480
See you in a year to make sure that leak's still going

54:14.480 --> 54:15.680
because man, it's important.

54:15.680 --> 54:17.040
That was actually one of my favorite things

54:17.040 --> 54:20.320
about the brief stint at Jimmy John's I worked where-

54:20.320 --> 54:21.280
Doesn't have a stink.

54:21.280 --> 54:22.400
Doesn't have a stink at Jimmy John's.

54:22.400 --> 54:23.200
Doesn't have a stink.

54:23.200 --> 54:25.600
Also doesn't like customize sandwiches.

54:25.600 --> 54:28.080
All they'll do is not put things on it.

54:28.080 --> 54:28.560
You know what I mean?

54:28.560 --> 54:30.960
So people come in like, could I get the number 12?

54:30.960 --> 54:32.160
But could I get that with, nope.

54:32.800 --> 54:33.440
It's really stinky.

54:33.440 --> 54:35.280
No, I just want to add extra, nope.

54:35.280 --> 54:39.040
I remember you could get an extra slice of like mozzarella

54:39.040 --> 54:41.040
on your sandwich and it was a dollar.

54:41.040 --> 54:42.160
Hey, guess what?

54:42.160 --> 54:43.440
Fuck you, Jimmy John's.

54:43.440 --> 54:47.360
I can go buy a whole package of it at Kroger's for a dollar.

54:47.360 --> 54:50.400
And then I can have like a full blown cheese explosion

54:50.400 --> 54:51.440
on my sandwich.

54:51.440 --> 54:53.280
I loved that for a while and he might still do it.

54:53.280 --> 54:57.120
Jimmy John's whole thing was like, we're just sandwiches.

54:57.120 --> 54:58.640
We don't toast them.

54:58.640 --> 55:00.160
We don't do soup.

55:00.160 --> 55:03.200
We don't do specialty, just sandwiches.

55:03.200 --> 55:06.720
It's like, so your whole sales pitch is we don't do extra things.

55:06.720 --> 55:07.120
We don't.

55:07.120 --> 55:09.360
We just do the one thing and we do it okay.

55:09.360 --> 55:09.920
That'll be $14.

55:09.920 --> 55:12.560
We do not go above and beyond by any means.

55:12.560 --> 55:17.120
These are artisanal sandwiches prepared by expert chefs

55:17.120 --> 55:19.360
who've been apprenticing since they were 13.

55:19.360 --> 55:22.640
And also they're 16 now and they're so good at sandwiches.

55:22.640 --> 55:24.080
That'll be $14.59.

55:25.040 --> 55:27.600
The problem I have with ordering at Subway

55:27.600 --> 55:30.480
and trying to get a perfect sandwich is that,

55:30.480 --> 55:32.720
and this should help this question asker.

55:32.720 --> 55:34.080
So I'm happy to pitch in here.

55:34.640 --> 55:39.520
I can't, I always feel awkward about ordering a topping

55:40.160 --> 55:42.320
and then I get pretty specific.

55:42.320 --> 55:44.960
Like when I'm watching them put the topping on,

55:45.600 --> 55:49.680
I feel like it's really, I feel like this urge to control

55:49.680 --> 55:52.640
the amount of that topping that I'm getting.

55:52.640 --> 55:56.080
Like if I ask for green peppers, I don't want 50.

55:56.080 --> 55:58.640
And their inclination is usually to put 50 on there.

55:58.640 --> 55:59.280
Thank you.

55:59.280 --> 55:59.920
You're an artist.

55:59.920 --> 56:00.720
That's very generous.

56:00.720 --> 56:03.520
Or mustard, they spread, they fucking,

56:03.520 --> 56:05.840
they ejaculate that mustard onto your sandwich

56:05.840 --> 56:07.920
with the carelessness of like a lunatic

56:07.920 --> 56:09.360
watering their front yard.

56:09.360 --> 56:12.560
Like it's a nightmare to watch.

56:12.560 --> 56:14.000
That's why no matter what I get,

56:14.000 --> 56:15.520
no matter what I get at Subway,

56:15.520 --> 56:18.720
I always say, and I'd like that with this and this and this,

56:18.720 --> 56:20.160
and I'd like to make it myself.

56:22.800 --> 56:25.040
Can I get back, can I get back there?

56:25.040 --> 56:28.160
And let me just, I know exactly how much lettuce I want.

56:28.160 --> 56:31.520
Please do not touch it with your stupid service person hands.

56:31.520 --> 56:33.760
I know shit at the Sub.

56:33.760 --> 56:36.800
I don't want to put this particular Subway chain on blast.

56:36.800 --> 56:38.800
Although if the quality control hasn't picked up

56:38.800 --> 56:40.560
since the time I worked at the country's best yogurt,

56:40.560 --> 56:43.120
they've definitely either closed or been closed

56:43.120 --> 56:44.640
by some sort of government agency.

56:44.640 --> 56:47.600
Somebody was cutting bread, cut clean into their finger

56:47.600 --> 56:49.520
and then kept trying to do the sandwich.

56:49.520 --> 56:52.960
Hey lady, you're not a fucking master chef.

56:52.960 --> 56:54.960
Like you're not under a tight time constraint.

56:54.960 --> 56:57.440
Someone else can go ahead and take the reins from you.

56:57.440 --> 56:59.760
On this particular sandwich.

56:59.760 --> 57:02.160
Let me get that with the oil and vinegar

57:02.160 --> 57:03.840
and salt and pepper, a little bit of lettuce

57:03.840 --> 57:05.760
and like a half pint of your blood.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.240
You're not on fucking chopped.

57:08.240 --> 57:11.520
Like it's okay if this sandwich takes a while to make

57:11.520 --> 57:13.040
and if someone else does it.

57:13.040 --> 57:14.960
I can happily confirm that Subway is still open

57:14.960 --> 57:17.600
by the way Griffin, so don't even worry about it.

57:17.600 --> 57:19.920
Great, well I'm not gonna, I'm sure there's a lot of Subways

57:19.920 --> 57:22.960
adjacent to the country's best yogurts in the country.

57:22.960 --> 57:24.800
Not so many anymore I don't think.

57:24.800 --> 57:27.520
Like this one was on 8th Street in Huntington, West Virginia.

57:27.520 --> 57:28.080
Have fun guys.

57:31.120 --> 57:33.520
This week's episode is brought to you by Subway.

57:33.520 --> 57:34.000
Subway.

57:34.800 --> 57:36.800
Specifically the one Subway on 8th Street

57:36.800 --> 57:37.920
in Huntington, West Virginia.

57:39.040 --> 57:41.520
This is narrow casting at its best.

57:42.880 --> 57:45.120
This has actually just been my brother, my brother and me.

57:45.120 --> 57:48.160
It's like a, it's a podcast for advice and jokes

57:48.160 --> 57:50.320
and love and laughter and-

57:50.320 --> 57:51.200
Is that the whole ep?

57:51.200 --> 57:52.240
Where does the time go?

57:52.240 --> 57:52.960
I know, right?

57:52.960 --> 57:54.480
It flies by when we're having it.

57:54.480 --> 57:56.240
It feels like it's been about an hour and three minutes

57:56.240 --> 57:56.880
for me actually.

57:57.440 --> 57:59.200
It's about time for me to start sweeping up.

58:00.640 --> 58:00.880
Saddle.

58:00.880 --> 58:02.880
Plensing us back into the old trunks.

58:03.840 --> 58:06.880
We need sad ending music like Dumbo's Circus had.

58:07.520 --> 58:12.800
Get back in the wagon, we're saying goodbye, we've got to fly.

58:15.840 --> 58:18.240
Thank you so much for reminding me of that show.

58:19.600 --> 58:21.280
I'm gonna get off right now and watch it on Hulu Plus.

58:21.280 --> 58:24.560
What about if it's like, show me that smile.

58:24.560 --> 58:27.440
It's like the growing pains theme, but like a funeral dirge,

58:27.440 --> 58:29.200
which is how the, I think that's how the show ended.

58:30.080 --> 58:33.040
Remember, everybody go to naturebox.com,

58:33.040 --> 58:34.800
use the coupon code MYBROTHER,

58:34.800 --> 58:36.400
and you're gonna save 50% off.

58:36.400 --> 58:38.160
How is that, how is that typed?

58:38.720 --> 58:41.040
Can you provide the exact typing of-

58:41.040 --> 58:42.960
Okay, in our notes, it has a space.

58:42.960 --> 58:44.800
So try it with a space first, if that doesn't work.

58:44.800 --> 58:46.880
Capital M, capital B, with a space.

58:46.880 --> 58:47.520
With a space.

58:47.520 --> 58:49.440
Try that first, if that doesn't work, just try it all together.

58:49.440 --> 58:51.520
But, Nature Box, go get you some.

58:51.520 --> 58:54.080
And let us know if you can eat any good snacks.

58:54.080 --> 58:56.080
I can personally recommend the banana bread granola,

58:56.080 --> 58:56.880
that's really good.

58:56.880 --> 58:58.480
Cindy likes the Santa Fe corn sticks.

58:58.480 --> 58:59.840
If you get chili lime pistachios,

58:59.840 --> 59:01.200
if you could send some of those my way,

59:01.200 --> 59:02.560
because we did get a sample box,

59:02.560 --> 59:05.360
and Rachel did eat all of them before I had a chance to taste any.

59:06.320 --> 59:08.480
Here's the good news, all the Nature Box snacks

59:08.480 --> 59:10.320
are really healthy and made from good stuff

59:10.320 --> 59:13.360
and no weird ingredients, no mystery ingredients.

59:13.360 --> 59:14.640
So she can eat as many as she wants,

59:14.640 --> 59:16.000
she's not gonna grow a horn or anything.

59:16.000 --> 59:16.880
No, I know, but I wanted-

59:16.880 --> 59:18.720
Apparently, as many as she wants is all of them.

59:18.720 --> 59:19.520
This is all of them.

59:19.520 --> 59:20.880
What's my favorite flavor combo?

59:20.880 --> 59:21.680
Mm, chili and lime.

59:21.680 --> 59:22.560
What's my favorite nut?

59:22.560 --> 59:23.360
Mm, pistachio.

59:23.920 --> 59:25.280
Yeah, I think I would have liked some of those.

59:28.560 --> 59:30.320
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show,

59:30.320 --> 59:31.680
helping us spread the word.

59:31.680 --> 59:34.240
We know we had some issues last week with the download.

59:34.240 --> 59:36.320
Totally, for once, not our fault.

59:37.600 --> 59:39.680
It was the fault of our friends at Libsyn.

59:39.680 --> 59:41.040
Should be working now.

59:41.040 --> 59:42.240
Listen, they provide a great service.

59:42.880 --> 59:45.440
It's so rare that things go sideways,

59:45.440 --> 59:46.960
but I re-uploaded it a third time,

59:46.960 --> 59:49.600
so if you missed it last week, it should be working now, I hope.

59:51.040 --> 59:52.560
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

59:52.560 --> 59:54.480
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

59:54.480 --> 59:56.080
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

59:56.080 --> 59:57.280
Are they touring right now?

59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.960
Because I just read a concert review of theirs from-

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.160
They're definitely playing some shows.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.920
I don't know if it's a full-blown tour, but yeah.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.600
Man, goddammit, I would kill to see that.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.640
I know, I know.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.400
So if you're The Long Winters and you're listening,

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.760
come on by our house and do a show.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.600
No, The Long Winters with a T.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.640
What did Justin say?

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.160
I swear he said The Long Winters,

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.360
which just sounds like a group of people

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.280
that tell really long, boring stories.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.080
No, they have a name for that.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.440
It's called My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.840
That's our show, folks.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.720
Thank you so much for listening.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.400
Griffith, do you have one last question to take us out on?

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.720
I'm so upset about these pistachios.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.360
The bag wasn't opened, and she was like,

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.120
I thought it was because you didn't want them,

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.880
and it was actually the opposite.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.080
I was so excited to eat them.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.240
I was like saving it for a weekend treat.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.800
Because this final Yahoo was sent in by Andrew Garcia.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:47.360
Thanks, Andrew.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.440
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Richard, who asks,

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.200
what determines a moose's coloration?

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.640
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.680
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.480
I'm Griffith McElroy.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.400
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.080
Make it back in the wagon.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.440
We're saying goodbye.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:13.840
Kiss your dad's square on the way.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.440
Maximumfun.org.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.480
Comedy and culture.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.600
Artist-owned.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.640
Listener-supported.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.160
Justin, what are you doing?

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.720
Strapping a chicken in my arm.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.320
Heard there's some plague out west,

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.040
so I just wanted to kind of get out ahead of it.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.360
Justin, if you'd ever listened to our medical history

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.320
podcast, Sawbones, where we talk about everything

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.320
from trepanation to bloodletting,

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.400
you would know that that is a ridiculous idea,

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.520
and it will never work.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:48.880
Sawbones.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.400
I haven't caught it.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:50.960
Sawbones?

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.080
Yes.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.720
It's every Friday on the Maximum Fun Network,

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.400
and we're going to be talking about it.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.880
It's every Friday on the Maximum Fun Network,

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.720
and we record it together.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:03.840
Do you need a doctor or something?

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:26.880
Yes.
