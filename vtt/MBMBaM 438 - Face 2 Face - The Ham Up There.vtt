00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.600
When they turn those front house lights on, it really lets you know how dirty your glasses are.

00:50.800 --> 00:55.600
Hello, Denver, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:55.600 --> 01:05.760
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Didn't get your fill earlier, I see.

01:06.880 --> 01:13.600
I'm glad to see you're back for a second. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:19.840 --> 01:23.920
It's going to be a Travis show. I'm your sweet baby brother in

01:23.920 --> 01:39.440
30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy. Can we do that in a different order sometime

01:39.440 --> 01:44.400
where it doesn't feel like a fuck? Denver, listen, the last thing Justin

01:44.400 --> 01:48.720
said to Travis and I backstage, this is not a joke, and it's probably unprecedented,

01:48.720 --> 01:53.280
I think, in our career of live performance. He said, y'all got to just watch your chill

01:53.280 --> 02:00.400
level out there because they are incredibly hyphy. I think he was suggesting we don't

02:00.400 --> 02:04.560
match your level or else we'll just start fucking crowd surfing and you guys won't

02:04.560 --> 02:09.680
get a very good podcast. We won't. We won't. We won't. We won't. We shan't.

02:10.320 --> 02:19.040
Okay. We used to like horses a lot, and we thought coming to a beautiful horse town

02:19.040 --> 02:24.640
like Denver, a town, I would say, competing with Louisville for how much they define

02:24.640 --> 02:30.160
themselves by horses. Even Lexington too, I think, loves horses. They all love horses.

02:31.280 --> 02:35.120
Think to yourself other cities that love horses because that's what this podcast

02:35.120 --> 02:39.760
has been for a little bit now. Yeah. We thought they have such a powerful

02:39.760 --> 02:46.160
horse in Denver. They celebrate them. They went to play football and they said,

02:46.160 --> 02:53.200
let's call ourselves horses, and they said, no, no, no, no. We shall be the Magnum horse,

02:53.920 --> 03:01.360
the most powerful horses on earth, the Bronco. A bunch of sports fans in the audience tonight.

03:03.760 --> 03:09.840
There always are at our shows, and that was until we landed at your airport.

03:09.840 --> 03:14.160
Airport? Okay.

03:14.160 --> 03:19.760
Some airport fans tonight. Hey, folks. What's with the horse?

03:22.160 --> 03:29.840
Okay. I have two children, and I could not explain to them

03:31.680 --> 03:36.000
some things about the horse. It's huge. It's fucking huge.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.920
Unfathomable. It's blue, and it has glowing evil red eyes.

03:41.920 --> 03:49.680
The demon. Who in your goddamn city looked at that and said,

03:49.680 --> 03:53.680
that perfectly encapsulates what we want visitors to feel about this city?

03:53.680 --> 03:59.520
Your greeting to this beautiful mountainous city is, yeah, come on in, motherfuckers.

03:59.520 --> 04:06.880
I'm told it's nicknamed Blucifer. Okay.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.760
Can I? Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Wait.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.840
Why are you cheering for this horse? It's so fucking scary.

04:16.160 --> 04:27.200
It looks like a scarecrow for evil alien crows that is designed to scare off aliens or something.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.440
It's like if a monster came here, the monster would be like, oh, no, they've already got a monster.

04:32.320 --> 04:36.960
If Godzilla came, he's like, I'm not doing battle with that. No way. No, thanks. Hard pass.

04:38.720 --> 04:42.720
We do advice on this show. Justin, I don't know if he said it or not,

04:42.720 --> 04:46.800
but sometimes we do other stuff, too. Like, for instance, Yahoo. Do you guys want Yahoo?

04:46.800 --> 04:53.280
Oh, I'd love that. Could I get a bit more monitor?

04:53.280 --> 04:57.600
The horniness is interfering with my ability to hear.

05:02.240 --> 05:07.920
Here is one sent in by Adrian Cowles. Thank you, Adrian. It's Yahoo Answers user Billy who asks.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.120
Billy? What a git.

05:09.760 --> 05:16.080
Billy asks, does NASA drug test? I'm thinking of being an astronaut.

05:16.080 --> 05:24.880
First of all, is astronaut just something you do on a whim?

05:26.080 --> 05:32.480
It's not like getting a job at like a gas station. I think I'll apply at NASA. Just roll the dice.

05:32.480 --> 05:37.280
Here's what I know about how to get a job at astronaut.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.240
Aliens invade and they need all hands on deck. That's number one.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.640
Number one. Maybe you have your own plane.

05:44.640 --> 05:49.120
Maybe you have your own plane, sure. They technically were freelancers in Independence Day,

05:49.120 --> 05:54.160
I'm pretty sure, but I'll meet you halfway. Three, you work at an oil rig and...

05:55.600 --> 05:57.440
What the fuck was up with that movie?

05:58.480 --> 06:03.680
They didn't have to... The premise of that movie, it was easier to train

06:04.480 --> 06:07.760
drillers to be astronauts than train astronauts to be drillers.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.600
You're really indignant about this. I am.

06:09.600 --> 06:15.760
Damn it. I think I would like to meet the person who's like,

06:17.280 --> 06:22.480
I should stop doing drugs. I have been kicking around the idea of becoming an astronaut.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.560
I think that the ship of time has already sailed for you.

06:29.200 --> 06:34.640
There's no film where Randy Quaid decides in his mid-60s, he's like,

06:34.640 --> 06:41.520
you know what? I've still got a great pitch. I'm going to be an astronaut. I'm going to pursue my

06:41.520 --> 06:47.280
lifelong dream of finally becoming an astronaut. Just to correct you, the scenario would actually

06:47.280 --> 06:52.480
be, I want to be an astronaut, but I'm not willing to give up. I'm smoking weed.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.160
I very much want to do both. That's actually very true,

06:54.160 --> 06:57.520
right? Because they could just quit and circumvent the problem.

06:58.240 --> 07:03.680
Okay. Also, NASA wouldn't have a leg to stand on for drug testing because they would not be

07:03.680 --> 07:10.320
where they are without drugged out people going, I want to go up there. That's where that starts.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.400
Somebody looked at the moon and go, I want to eat that.

07:13.360 --> 07:18.480
I feel like there's certain jobs. If you get elected president of the United States,

07:19.280 --> 07:25.680
I don't think they can drug test you because who would do it?

07:27.040 --> 07:28.960
I got drug tested at Best Buy.

07:28.960 --> 07:34.800
The point is, they wouldn't be like, bad news, everybody. I know how you voted,

07:34.800 --> 07:39.920
but you failed a drug test. I feel like astronauts, there's like, what,

07:39.920 --> 07:43.520
like a hundred people living who've gone into space? I just made that up.

07:44.880 --> 07:48.560
I don't think they're going to do it. I think you're totally fine.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.520
I think you're going to totally fine. To be fair, they put them through pretty

07:51.520 --> 07:56.560
rigorous testing. If you passed every test except a drug test, they'd be like,

07:56.560 --> 07:59.680
still better than most, get up there. I'll tell you one thing.

07:59.680 --> 08:04.880
They obviously know how to handle your shit. They sure don't test you while you're up there.

08:07.680 --> 08:12.960
That's a good point. There is an argument to be made for ground control being like, well,

08:12.960 --> 08:18.240
I mean, you're the one going in the rocket. You got to fear it, so fuck it.

08:18.240 --> 08:22.080
If you want to get high, I guess. I mean, it seems ill-advised.

08:22.080 --> 08:28.000
It certainly happened. Do you all know about John Young and the space sandwich that he ate?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.720
I talked about this on Wonderful, so I apologize that I'm double dipping,

08:30.720 --> 08:34.000
but there was an astronaut named John Young who was in the Gemini missions,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.840
and he was in a mission with a dude named Gus, who I can't remember.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.760
I just love that there was a guy with this. I'm Gus the astronaut.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.160
I'm Gus, and I'm in space. He was probably great.

08:43.920 --> 08:48.080
There's a recording that you can find on YouTube of Gus like, what you got there?

08:48.080 --> 08:52.240
And John Young's like, corned beef sandwich, brought it from home, and he just fucking

08:52.240 --> 08:54.480
eats it, and Gus is like, wow, you brought a sandwich from home?

08:54.480 --> 08:56.000
He's like, yeah, it stinks, doesn't it?

08:58.800 --> 09:04.560
If that can happen, I don't see why you can't get like one joint up there in a fold of yours.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.000
Did he get in trouble?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.080
Yeah, he got very much in trouble when he got home, yes.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.800
It was reprimanded by Congress.

09:12.720 --> 09:17.040
Hey, we all got together. We're angry about your sandwich, John.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.400
What are they going to do?

09:18.400 --> 09:19.680
You're not allowed to go to space.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.400
I already did.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.360
You're not allowed to have sandwiches anymore.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.040
The problem is, he got in trouble when he came home.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.000
He shouldn't have came home.

09:33.200 --> 09:37.920
I should have been like, hey, listen, we're super mad about the sandwich,

09:37.920 --> 09:41.120
and as soon as you get down here, be like, I'm driving this bitch to Mars.

09:41.120 --> 09:41.920
Fuck off.

09:41.920 --> 09:42.800
Bye-bye.

09:42.800 --> 09:43.520
Bye-bye.

09:43.520 --> 09:44.400
Turning it around.

09:44.400 --> 09:44.900
Bye.

09:44.900 --> 09:49.460
How about a question from one of our friends sitting before us?

09:49.460 --> 09:50.740
I've got loads.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.820
I hosted a murder mystery party at my home for a dozen friends.

09:56.020 --> 09:59.140
Everyone had a great time solving a spooky vampire murder.

10:00.020 --> 10:01.780
They wouldn't have told you if they didn't.

10:01.780 --> 10:03.940
I'm just saying, like, you went through a lot of...

10:03.940 --> 10:08.740
Also, couldn't you just get some garlic and smash it into all your friends' faces?

10:08.740 --> 10:10.020
Easy peasy, beautiful.

10:10.020 --> 10:13.620
Wait, that's not how a murder mystery party works.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.860
I'm just saying, if you're trying to find the vampire, sorry, Justin.

10:15.860 --> 10:19.140
But the real crime wasn't discovered until the following morning.

10:19.140 --> 10:22.100
Evidently, one of my guests fell on their way down to the basement

10:22.100 --> 10:24.500
and relieved themselves directly into my sewing box,

10:26.340 --> 10:28.820
filling it with an impressive amount of urine.

10:30.260 --> 10:33.940
There were no witnesses, and no one will admit to being the perpetrator.

10:34.980 --> 10:38.020
Brothers, this mystery has haunted me for months.

10:38.020 --> 10:40.020
Ah, a cold case.

10:40.020 --> 10:43.540
How can I uncover the criminal behind this heinous act?

10:43.540 --> 10:47.700
And what do I do with this information once I have?

10:47.700 --> 10:50.340
That's from Poor Man's Porro.

10:50.340 --> 10:52.820
We would have also accepted Piss Poor Porro.

10:52.820 --> 10:53.300
Yes.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.340
Would have been...

10:54.340 --> 10:56.260
Well, I answer the second part first.

10:56.260 --> 10:57.060
Are you here?

10:58.580 --> 10:59.220
All right.

10:59.220 --> 11:00.020
There's eight of you.

11:00.020 --> 11:01.700
You're a juvian throat singer.

11:01.700 --> 11:06.900
That's so weird that there's multiple people having this exact same situation.

11:06.900 --> 11:10.100
So once you figure out the information, you'll have them arrested.

11:10.100 --> 11:10.900
That's...

11:10.900 --> 11:12.020
We'll start there.

11:12.020 --> 11:14.020
They're going to go to jail for what they've done.

11:15.380 --> 11:16.420
It's a crime.

11:16.420 --> 11:17.460
It is a crime.

11:17.460 --> 11:18.420
It's a crime.

11:18.420 --> 11:23.220
You know, a lot of those puzzles can be really difficult to figure out,

11:23.220 --> 11:26.420
and I could see getting to a point in like an escape room

11:26.420 --> 11:30.580
where you might think like, maybe I'm supposed to piss in a sewing box.

11:31.380 --> 11:34.260
The clues seem to be leading me towards...

11:34.260 --> 11:36.100
I should piss in a sewing box.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.940
I should piss in the sewing box.

11:37.940 --> 11:42.660
The hint screen flashes like, uh, dog, I have to clean this up after everything.

11:44.260 --> 11:44.820
Look up here.

11:45.460 --> 11:47.380
I thought you were doing a haunted doll watch for a second.

11:47.380 --> 11:48.420
No, no, no.

11:48.420 --> 11:48.820
It's not...

11:48.820 --> 11:49.700
It didn't work like that.

11:51.940 --> 11:53.220
Yeah, I mean, you got...

11:53.220 --> 11:54.900
The good news is you have so many options.

11:55.940 --> 11:58.340
Did the original mystery come with a DNA test?

11:58.340 --> 12:00.100
I'm saying this out loud, and of course it didn't.

12:01.780 --> 12:04.820
I said DNA test like it was going to have a little like 23andMe thing

12:04.820 --> 12:06.260
that you could scoop some hot piss into.

12:06.260 --> 12:08.820
Is there DNA in urine?

12:08.820 --> 12:10.580
I'm willing to bet no.

12:12.180 --> 12:14.580
No audience poll time.

12:17.780 --> 12:18.180
Is there...

12:19.700 --> 12:21.300
Yes, it's a resounding yes.

12:21.300 --> 12:21.540
Okay.

12:24.580 --> 12:27.620
I didn't mean to set off just a wave of conversation.

12:27.620 --> 12:28.980
You don't know the answer.

12:28.980 --> 12:30.020
Maybe here's what you do.

12:30.020 --> 12:31.300
Here's what you do, right?

12:31.300 --> 12:34.420
Right now you probably call everyone like, did you pee in my sewing box?

12:34.420 --> 12:34.740
Right?

12:34.740 --> 12:36.420
I'm not going to fess up to that.

12:36.420 --> 12:40.340
But if you go on and you're like, oh my God, somebody peed in the sewing box,

12:40.340 --> 12:41.540
it was hilarious.

12:41.540 --> 12:41.860
Yeah.

12:41.860 --> 12:42.740
Joke of the century.

12:42.740 --> 12:44.900
This person is the Banksy of Piss.

12:44.900 --> 12:45.460
Yeah.

12:45.460 --> 12:45.780
Right?

12:45.780 --> 12:48.500
That's the kind of thing where someone's going to be like, it wasn't me.

12:49.220 --> 12:50.980
Then you slap the cuffs on them.

12:50.980 --> 12:57.140
And then Banksy hears that and in a rage just like destroys his piss art he was working on.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.380
He had a...

12:59.380 --> 13:01.380
Oh my God, this is something Banksy would do.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.460
Okay.

13:03.460 --> 13:04.740
I'm saying...

13:04.740 --> 13:06.020
I don't think so.

13:06.020 --> 13:07.140
Could it be Banksy?

13:08.820 --> 13:10.340
Is one of your friends Banksy?

13:10.340 --> 13:12.340
I don't think it could be Banksy on this one.

13:12.340 --> 13:13.780
Is their last name Banks?

13:13.780 --> 13:15.860
And you just never put it together.

13:15.860 --> 13:17.140
Do they work at a bank?

13:17.140 --> 13:18.420
Do they live by a river?

13:18.420 --> 13:20.580
I don't think Banksy on this one.

13:20.580 --> 13:21.860
Here's what I would do.

13:21.860 --> 13:26.100
Send a group text to everybody who was at the party and say bad news.

13:26.100 --> 13:35.060
Bad news, my dog pisses in my sewing box.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.180
I'm going to have her put down.

13:38.740 --> 13:39.300
It's real...

13:40.100 --> 13:46.180
I'm real sad about it, but it said in the book that if they piss in your sewing box once,

13:46.180 --> 13:47.300
they're going to keep doing it.

13:47.300 --> 13:51.940
And I love to sew, so I've got a hatchet and I'm going to put my dog down.

13:51.940 --> 13:57.060
And then you just keep going and describing it.

13:57.060 --> 13:59.540
And eventually one of them is going to fucking crack.

13:59.540 --> 14:00.180
Yeah.

14:00.180 --> 14:02.020
It may not even be the person who did it.

14:03.700 --> 14:04.900
I'm the pisser.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.340
No, I'm the pisser.

14:08.340 --> 14:09.780
I'm Spartapus.

14:09.780 --> 14:11.940
You will accept it.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.300
I think you also have a great opportunity.

14:17.300 --> 14:20.260
I have been to exactly one murder mystery party in my life.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.620
It was really fun.

14:21.620 --> 14:24.260
I got blackout drunk before the thing even started.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.060
How do you know it was fun?

14:27.060 --> 14:29.460
I spent a lot of it doing deep breathing outside,

14:29.460 --> 14:32.740
but then they brought in this like cheesy garlic pull apart bread.

14:32.740 --> 14:33.940
I got no clues.

14:34.580 --> 14:37.460
I've been desperate to participate in a second murder mystery party,

14:37.460 --> 14:39.700
but it's a real hassle to put those on.

14:39.700 --> 14:44.820
You have a baked in second mystery party on your hands.

14:44.820 --> 14:49.060
You could say it's a Super Bowl party and then lock the door from the outside and say,

14:49.060 --> 14:51.700
we're not leaving here until everybody-

14:51.700 --> 14:54.180
You lock the door from the outside, then you come back in through the window.

14:54.180 --> 14:54.820
Yeah.

14:54.820 --> 14:57.140
I've got 13 sewing kits here.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.700
You all know what to do.

15:00.420 --> 15:03.460
The person who steps forward first, suspicious.

15:03.460 --> 15:03.700
Yeah.

15:04.260 --> 15:05.300
I'm comfortable with this.

15:07.380 --> 15:09.300
You could also measure it by volume.

15:11.620 --> 15:12.180
Volume.

15:13.220 --> 15:13.700
Aroma.

15:13.700 --> 15:14.420
This is gross.

15:14.420 --> 15:16.180
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

15:16.180 --> 15:16.420
Yes.

15:16.420 --> 15:18.500
Here's one that was sent in by a few people.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.020
Thank you, a few people.

15:20.020 --> 15:23.460
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user, Emily, who asks,

15:23.460 --> 15:29.140
what non-toxic additions can you put into handmade soap to jazz it up?

15:31.140 --> 15:36.340
I'm learning to make soap so that I have a nice handmade gift to give to co-workers, friends, etc.

15:37.140 --> 15:40.100
I was wondering if there are any non-toxic additions I can add to it.

15:40.100 --> 15:43.460
I've tried apricot seeds, for example, and may try glitter.

15:43.460 --> 15:44.500
Thanks for your help.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.460
Don't do glitter.

15:45.460 --> 15:46.740
Don't do glitter.

15:46.740 --> 15:47.780
Not glitter, though.

15:48.340 --> 15:49.460
Update, edit.

15:49.460 --> 15:50.980
Definitely won't use glitter.

15:50.980 --> 15:51.780
Thanks, everyone.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.700
Good thing I never made any glitter soaps.

15:57.860 --> 15:59.940
You could put other soap in the middle.

15:59.940 --> 16:01.380
You didn't even need to think about that one.

16:01.380 --> 16:01.780
No, yeah.

16:01.780 --> 16:03.700
If somebody gave me some handmade soap,

16:03.700 --> 16:06.820
and as I was washing my hand, in the middle was a bar of Irish spring,

16:06.820 --> 16:08.100
I'd be really excited.

16:08.100 --> 16:14.580
I wouldn't wash my worst enemy's grundle with Irish spring.

16:14.580 --> 16:17.620
I don't know what good, what is good bar soap being said.

16:17.620 --> 16:18.980
I'll tell you what it is.

16:18.980 --> 16:23.780
It's that dove shit from the commercials where they pour it like a thing of milk and it forms the bar.

16:23.780 --> 16:28.660
When I was a kid, I saw that shit every time I thought, that looks delicious.

16:28.660 --> 16:29.780
Was that their intention?

16:30.580 --> 16:35.380
There was a long time, there's a long time when I was a kid where I believed scientifically you

16:35.380 --> 16:38.500
were not fully clean unless you were scientifically clean.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.000
Sure.

16:39.860 --> 16:42.100
I think you could put a key in there.

16:44.100 --> 16:44.900
A key to what?

16:45.620 --> 16:46.260
Exactly.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.420
I'm clean and curious.

16:52.580 --> 16:53.460
A key.

16:53.460 --> 16:55.780
What about a juicy fruit center?

16:57.140 --> 16:59.860
Like a gusher, like a fruit gusher.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.380
Like a gusher.

17:01.940 --> 17:02.660
What about dirt?

17:02.660 --> 17:07.140
It would be tough to get to it while it's still good to go.

17:08.820 --> 17:12.340
The moment the fruit juice touches the soapy interior, it's...

17:13.860 --> 17:16.740
At that point, what you've basically set up is like a center of fake blood.

17:19.140 --> 17:23.620
There's still a time where it's potable, but time lost is flavor loss.

17:23.620 --> 17:24.980
You need to crack that thing out of the box.

17:26.980 --> 17:32.100
Like Rafiki at the beginning of the Lion King, just like snap it over your face.

17:32.100 --> 17:32.660
Okay, wait.

17:32.660 --> 17:33.940
I would like to make a pitch.

17:33.940 --> 17:34.740
Yes.

17:34.740 --> 17:35.860
Soap on the outside.

17:35.860 --> 17:36.580
Yes.

17:36.580 --> 17:37.700
Mud on the inside.

17:40.340 --> 17:41.860
More soap in the middle.

17:41.860 --> 17:42.580
I love this.

17:43.220 --> 17:44.580
That's an afternoon right there.

17:44.580 --> 17:46.020
Yeah, you come back around.

17:46.900 --> 17:47.700
I do.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.260
I tell you, Trav, holy shit.

17:50.260 --> 17:51.380
That's a good idea.

17:52.180 --> 17:56.660
Listen, listen, and this doesn't have to be nasty if you don't want it to be,

17:56.660 --> 17:59.860
but doesn't everybody like getting a little muddy sometimes?

17:59.860 --> 18:00.360
Right?

18:00.360 --> 18:04.120
And you know how like with an iPhone, they design it to break after a while,

18:04.120 --> 18:05.160
so you have to buy a new one?

18:05.960 --> 18:10.760
Maybe in the middle of the soap, there's just a tiny little bit of mud just to finish it off.

18:10.760 --> 18:14.200
Well, now I've got to go back to the store and buy more of this specific soap

18:14.200 --> 18:18.840
because all of his soaps have been bought up by Travis and I don't know, been ended.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.960
Travis has ended all soap with that mud soap.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.520
I hate this new dystopian future in which we live.

18:24.520 --> 18:30.440
What if you just, what if a soap shaped like a canteen and it's filled with water

18:31.160 --> 18:32.520
and then you got everything you need?

18:34.040 --> 18:34.920
For what?

18:34.920 --> 18:37.960
If you're ever on Survivor or any other sort of island thing,

18:38.840 --> 18:40.280
you got everything you need.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.720
You got water from your canteen and then the canteen-

18:43.720 --> 18:44.520
Up with soap.

18:44.520 --> 18:47.160
That is, the canteen is soap, so you can clean yourself

18:47.160 --> 18:51.480
because they don't have soap on the island for sure and water is in short supply.

18:51.480 --> 18:56.600
So it's a canteen made of soap, you see, and it's filled with water.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.000
Water that has been in contact with soap?

19:01.000 --> 19:06.280
Yeah, because that's how you know that the water is free of germs.

19:06.280 --> 19:06.840
Hell yeah.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.280
And safe.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.360
Clean your fucking tummy out. I love this.

19:12.840 --> 19:16.680
Plus, if the soap gets hard in the sun, you can use it as a hatch to chop down some bamboo.

19:16.680 --> 19:19.400
You're not going to need the bamboo because you got your soap canteen

19:19.400 --> 19:21.080
and all your needs are being catered to.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.200
Damn, Justin, that was a good idea, bud.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.480
Thanks, thanks.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.600
I'm unappreciated in my time.

19:29.640 --> 19:30.520
Here's another question.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.960
I've worked at a large university and when I was hired,

19:33.960 --> 19:38.680
I RSVP'd to compete in a salsa contest, but I became so-

19:38.680 --> 19:42.200
I like the use of RSVP'd there instead of just like signed up.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.040
Yeah, volunteered.

19:44.040 --> 19:48.680
But I became so busy that suddenly the day of the contest was at hand

19:48.680 --> 19:50.360
and I hadn't made any salsa.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.080
Rather than back-

19:51.080 --> 19:54.920
You can't go that long without specifying what kind of salsa you're talking about.

19:54.920 --> 19:55.400
Fair.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.960
Rather than back out, I decided to run to my local Chili's

20:01.960 --> 20:05.640
and ask them to fill a jar of salsa for me so that I could enter.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.960
I ended up winning the contest.

20:07.960 --> 20:12.040
It's now been eight years and people still ask me for the recipe.

20:14.040 --> 20:17.880
I've brushed off so many people that it's now built my salsa up

20:17.880 --> 20:19.800
as some sort of mystical super salsa.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.560
I love it when Goku goes super salsa.

20:29.560 --> 20:33.240
I love it when Goku goes super salsa.

20:33.240 --> 20:38.520
I love it when Goku goes super salsa.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.200
Over 9,000 Scoville units.

20:43.560 --> 20:44.120
The number was 9,000.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.320
Aw, geek check.

20:46.520 --> 20:50.520
That no one has tasted since then because I'm afraid they'll definitely know it's Chili's

20:50.520 --> 20:51.880
if I break it into the office.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.400
Brothers, what do I do?

20:53.400 --> 20:55.000
I can't keep living this lie.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.320
That's from Bluffing in Boulder, Colorado.

20:57.320 --> 21:00.520
Normally we would ask if you're here,

21:00.520 --> 21:03.080
but I feel like if I just looked, I would know who you are.

21:03.080 --> 21:07.480
But are you here?

21:08.600 --> 21:09.560
All right.

21:09.560 --> 21:12.760
There is a lot to discuss here, but just real quick,

21:12.760 --> 21:15.560
I want to talk about one tiny element that jumped out at me.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.160
When you went to Chili's and asked them to fill up a jar,

21:19.160 --> 21:24.280
did you present the jar to them or did they just have a jar ready for such a request?

21:24.280 --> 21:26.040
And Trav, I got to tell you, bud, and it's good.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.280
We all come at these questions from different angles.

21:28.280 --> 21:31.800
That's what creates the heat of the cauldron that boils up the soup

21:31.800 --> 21:33.240
of my brother, my brother, and me.

21:33.240 --> 21:36.440
That would have been about question 46 on my list.

21:36.440 --> 21:40.840
My first being, why didn't you go to the fucking grocery store

21:40.840 --> 21:42.680
where salsa is traditionally sold

21:42.680 --> 21:48.680
instead of trying to get back channel salsa from the baby back ribs place?

21:49.880 --> 21:52.440
I kind of feel like we need this person on mic.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.800
I feel like you need to come to the mic.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.240
There's a lot of things we need to go through.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.920
If you don't want to, no pressure.

21:56.920 --> 21:57.800
You don't have to.

21:58.440 --> 21:58.920
Listen.

21:58.920 --> 21:59.880
Can we get a look?

21:59.880 --> 22:01.560
If you're not comfortable, that's fine.

22:01.560 --> 22:02.600
Stay seated.

22:02.600 --> 22:03.400
It's not a big deal.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.160
If you're not comfortable, just right now, yell no.

22:07.000 --> 22:07.400
No, no, no.

22:07.400 --> 22:07.800
Hold on.

22:07.800 --> 22:08.760
Don't you hear?

22:08.760 --> 22:10.200
This is not a peer pressure.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.040
Can we get some house lights, please?

22:12.040 --> 22:12.440
Oh, yeah.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.080
There we are.

22:13.080 --> 22:13.720
Thank you.

22:13.720 --> 22:14.040
Okay.

22:14.040 --> 22:14.600
Hi.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.320
Hello.

22:15.320 --> 22:15.640
Hi.

22:16.440 --> 22:17.480
Are you cool with this?

22:17.480 --> 22:17.800
Hello.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.640
Do you feel comfortable giving us your name?

22:19.640 --> 22:20.360
Absolutely.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.000
I'm Vanessa.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.320
You didn't even have to do the last name.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.360
Good luck with Facebook.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.560
I saw co-workers here.

22:29.560 --> 22:35.080
Okay, Vanessa, why didn't you come to the mic?

22:35.080 --> 22:37.800
Vanessa, this is not a place for confession.

22:39.160 --> 22:40.280
Oh, no.

22:40.280 --> 22:40.520
Okay.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.040
Now, everybody, please be quiet.

22:42.040 --> 22:43.000
I need to talk to Vanessa.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.600
Vanessa, why didn't you go to the grocery store?

22:45.800 --> 22:46.600
I didn't.

22:46.600 --> 22:49.640
I thought that I might have a chance to win with the chili sauce.

22:49.640 --> 22:50.120
I knew it.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.560
I knew it.

22:51.560 --> 22:52.040
Okay.

22:52.840 --> 22:53.640
I knew it.

22:55.240 --> 22:59.000
So, Vanessa, I love this because what I like about you, Vanessa,

22:59.000 --> 23:00.840
is that you were like sitting there like,

23:00.840 --> 23:03.160
who's got the fucking best salsa in Boulder?

23:04.360 --> 23:07.160
Best salsa in Boulder has got to be chilies.

23:08.920 --> 23:09.880
Vanessa?

23:09.880 --> 23:12.600
I was so worried that they would know it was chilies

23:12.600 --> 23:14.840
that I actually watered it down.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.400
I watered it down with other tomatoes.

23:18.040 --> 23:18.520
Yeah.

23:18.520 --> 23:19.240
So, wait.

23:19.240 --> 23:19.720
Hold on.

23:19.720 --> 23:20.360
Hold on.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.520
Where did you get those fucking tomatoes from?

23:23.400 --> 23:25.320
You had tomatoes then.

23:25.320 --> 23:25.880
So, at your house-

23:25.880 --> 23:31.240
You had 98% of salsa.

23:31.240 --> 23:34.840
Vanessa, I don't know why I do this,

23:34.840 --> 23:37.320
but I'm ready to absolve you right now.

23:38.600 --> 23:42.840
Because the good news is this is your salsa.

23:42.840 --> 23:43.080
Yeah.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.840
I mean, it is your salsa.

23:50.840 --> 23:55.720
Vanessa, there was a bunch of people at your office

23:55.720 --> 23:56.760
who have said to themselves,

23:56.760 --> 23:58.920
I love chili salsa, of course.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.840
It's just not tomato-y enough for me.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.560
It's a little too zesty.

24:03.560 --> 24:04.680
A little too zesty.

24:04.680 --> 24:07.720
I love it to be muddled and watered down with some tomatoes.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.320
You could, the next time someone asks,

24:09.320 --> 24:10.600
you can say, all right, fine.

24:10.600 --> 24:11.880
Here's my secret.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.400
Got some tomatoes.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.000
They can go to Chili's and boil them

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
into putting some salsa in a jar,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.400
but leave some room in there for those tomatoes.

24:19.400 --> 24:23.080
How did the, can you fill my loose jar with salsa now?

24:23.080 --> 24:25.400
I did bring a jar for it.

24:25.400 --> 24:26.600
You did bring a jar for it.

24:26.600 --> 24:27.240
Did you have-

24:27.240 --> 24:28.600
Did you pay by the pound?

24:28.600 --> 24:31.320
Did you have muddled up tomato mash

24:31.320 --> 24:32.520
at the bottom of the jar?

24:33.800 --> 24:37.880
No, no, but I did put a special little thing on top of it

24:37.880 --> 24:40.840
to decorate it, and then I called it Vanessa's Awesome Sauce.

24:40.840 --> 24:41.800
Come on.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.160
Vanessa.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.400
Vanessa, the bridge too far, Vanessa.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.240
Do you wanna, like, should we stop talking

24:47.240 --> 24:50.120
while you finish listing the many crimes you committed

24:50.120 --> 24:51.320
during this heinous act?

24:52.360 --> 24:53.400
It was a prize.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.240
I was money that I won.

24:55.240 --> 24:55.560
How much?

24:56.280 --> 24:57.720
It was 50 bucks.

24:57.720 --> 24:58.440
Nice.

24:58.440 --> 24:59.720
How much was the salsa?

25:00.840 --> 25:02.360
The salsa was about $10.

25:02.360 --> 25:05.880
I had just started, like, two weeks before, so-

25:05.880 --> 25:08.440
Oh, you wanted to establish yourself.

25:10.440 --> 25:11.960
Yeah, I mean, if anybody asks you the recipe,

25:11.960 --> 25:12.680
Justin's right.

25:12.680 --> 25:13.480
This is your own thing.

25:13.480 --> 25:17.960
You just say it's flavorless, watery tomatoes,

25:17.960 --> 25:19.080
and deceit.

25:21.480 --> 25:22.840
Vanessa, does that help?

25:22.840 --> 25:23.480
That helps.

25:23.480 --> 25:23.720
Thank you.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.400
Thank you, Vanessa, for your honesty.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.120
Thank you.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.800
You can bring the house lights down now.

25:29.080 --> 25:32.280
Once Vanessa's safely back to her seat,

25:32.280 --> 25:33.560
you can lower-

25:33.560 --> 25:35.560
I mean, you can go ahead and lower the house lights now.

25:35.560 --> 25:36.120
I believe-

25:36.120 --> 25:37.080
Oh, no, Vanessa's-

25:37.080 --> 25:37.800
Okay, there we go.

25:37.800 --> 25:38.120
Good.

25:38.120 --> 25:38.760
I just don't want Vanessa-

25:38.760 --> 25:39.480
And there they go.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.320
And there they go.

25:41.320 --> 25:42.840
Crawling down.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.120
My object permanence.

25:44.120 --> 25:44.840
Down.

25:44.840 --> 25:47.000
Listen to the sound of my voice.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.280
The house lights are gone.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.200
The lights are dimming around you.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.320
Be not afraid.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.800
This is an experience we're all having together.

25:54.920 --> 25:55.640
We're all old.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.480
So they put in a switch to turn them on,

25:57.480 --> 25:58.760
and they're frantically like,

25:58.760 --> 25:59.880
guys, do these go off?

26:00.680 --> 26:03.080
And the lights are dimming.

26:03.080 --> 26:03.880
See, now I'm freaking out,

26:03.880 --> 26:04.920
because it looks like they're dimming,

26:04.920 --> 26:06.600
but I think I'm just losing my mind.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.040
Okay, whatever.

26:08.040 --> 26:08.840
We'll keep doing the show.

26:08.840 --> 26:09.720
I want to move on.

26:09.720 --> 26:11.160
Please do turn the lights off.

26:11.160 --> 26:14.840
Here's a Yahoo.

26:14.840 --> 26:17.080
I was sent in by Rob Luppy.

26:19.960 --> 26:20.760
Almost certainly not.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.200
It's Yahoo Answers user,

26:22.200 --> 26:23.800
another part of me, who asks,

26:24.520 --> 26:25.880
and God, holy shit,

26:25.880 --> 26:26.840
I should have prefaced this.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.760
This is going to be a fun one.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.720
You guys get to play your games all the time.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.640
I feel like you guys bring games to the show.

26:33.640 --> 26:34.680
This one's going to be fun for me,

26:34.680 --> 26:36.520
because I kind of know what's going on,

26:36.520 --> 26:37.240
and you won't.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.320
It's going to be a real hoot and a half.

26:39.320 --> 26:39.560
Okay.

26:39.560 --> 26:41.880
Okay, another part of me asks,

26:43.400 --> 26:44.840
boy zone scenario?

26:47.000 --> 26:48.520
Okay, it's your birthday.

26:48.520 --> 26:49.880
Woot woot, LMAO.

26:56.360 --> 26:56.920
Woot woot.

26:58.360 --> 26:59.560
Your parents take you out.

26:59.560 --> 27:01.320
Hold on, nothing you just said

27:01.320 --> 27:03.400
would make someone laugh their ass off.

27:04.120 --> 27:04.920
It's your birthday.

27:06.920 --> 27:07.400
Great.

27:07.400 --> 27:07.880
It is.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.560
I was born on this day.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.560
Thank you for your laughter.

27:12.120 --> 27:14.200
Your parents take you out to a lush restaurant,

27:14.200 --> 27:15.880
and you need to use the toilet,

27:15.880 --> 27:17.640
but leading towards the back door,

27:17.640 --> 27:18.840
there's a trail of ink.

27:19.480 --> 27:21.560
This is the first mystery in this question.

27:22.760 --> 27:25.000
You follow it, and bam!

27:25.560 --> 27:27.320
Boys zone are standing outside.

27:31.320 --> 27:32.840
What would you do?

27:32.840 --> 27:33.800
XD?

27:34.600 --> 27:35.000
XD?

27:36.120 --> 27:36.840
Oh, I see.

27:36.840 --> 27:37.480
Big face.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.440
I'm not done.

27:38.440 --> 27:41.160
Pets greater than sign birds.

27:44.280 --> 27:46.680
A emoticon where like one eye is kind of big,

27:46.680 --> 27:47.640
and then there's a flat mouth,

27:47.640 --> 27:48.440
and then a small mouth.

27:49.000 --> 27:49.480
Update.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.720
WTF at Diana.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.280
Big eye, flat mouth, little eye.

27:56.120 --> 27:56.760
Begin.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.240
You have entered my labyrinth.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.200
Charles McElroy,

28:00.200 --> 28:02.120
do you understand this Yahoo answer?

28:02.120 --> 28:02.360
No.

28:04.040 --> 28:04.760
Griffin McElroy,

28:04.760 --> 28:06.520
do you understand this Yahoo answer?

28:06.520 --> 28:08.760
Only what a cursory Google searcher taught me.

28:08.760 --> 28:09.800
And I'm at a no.

28:09.800 --> 28:13.240
This is a no, no, no Google.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.720
Okay, here's what I do know.

28:15.720 --> 28:16.280
Yes?

28:16.280 --> 28:18.680
They have said that birds are better than pets.

28:18.680 --> 28:19.240
Yep.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.600
Nope, pets are better than birds.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.400
Oh, well, could birds not include?

28:23.400 --> 28:24.760
Birds would be in pets.

28:24.760 --> 28:26.360
Yeah, to some people, extremely much so.

28:26.360 --> 28:27.480
This is chilling.

28:27.480 --> 28:27.720
Yeah.

28:28.680 --> 28:30.360
My phone a friend is going to be...

28:31.880 --> 28:32.760
What's a boys zone?

28:32.760 --> 28:36.440
I assume it's a boy band.

28:36.440 --> 28:37.320
Here, let me frame it to you

28:37.320 --> 28:39.480
in a more sort of coherent sort of story.

28:39.480 --> 28:39.720
Okay.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.400
And then you guys can tell me what you do.

28:41.400 --> 28:41.720
Okay.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.680
You're at a lush restaurant.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.040
Your parents took you there.

28:44.040 --> 28:44.280
Okay.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.600
You have to go to the toilet.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.000
Got it.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.560
There's a trail of ink on the floor.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.000
Okay, I have a lot of questions.

28:51.000 --> 28:51.320
Okay.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.040
You follow the trail of ink

28:54.040 --> 28:55.400
and you find yourself in the boys zone.

28:55.400 --> 28:55.960
What do you do?

28:55.960 --> 29:01.160
Are, is boys zone like a team of squids?

29:04.520 --> 29:04.680
No.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.800
Is, is it...

29:10.600 --> 29:11.960
Is this, what's the...

29:11.960 --> 29:13.720
You don't have to guess what boys zone is.

29:13.720 --> 29:15.400
Just tell me what the fuck you do.

29:15.400 --> 29:17.720
You follow, no, you follow the ink.

29:18.440 --> 29:21.320
You arrive at boys zone.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.360
I just, I can't,

29:24.360 --> 29:26.840
I can't determine through context clues

29:26.840 --> 29:28.600
if I'm excited or dismayed.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.240
Damn it.

29:29.240 --> 29:30.040
What would you do?

29:32.040 --> 29:34.040
I probably start fighting my way out.

29:35.320 --> 29:36.760
That, I'll take that answer.

29:36.760 --> 29:37.640
Is this a...

29:37.640 --> 29:38.680
I'll give you a clue.

29:38.680 --> 29:39.720
You'll be outnumbered.

29:41.720 --> 29:43.480
Is this a splatoon thing?

29:45.160 --> 29:46.120
Absolutely not.

29:46.120 --> 29:46.440
Okay.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.320
This is what I love.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.080
You guys are thinking about the ink.

29:51.080 --> 29:51.640
You haven't,

29:51.640 --> 29:54.280
your minds haven't even conceived of the boys zone yet.

29:55.480 --> 29:58.040
If I, I think I would stay perfectly still

29:58.920 --> 30:01.320
and wait for the boys zone to...

30:01.320 --> 30:02.680
To migrate away.

30:02.680 --> 30:03.560
Migrator.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.040
Oh, I'd make myself big

30:06.040 --> 30:07.640
to see if I could scare them away.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.240
That's good.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.360
Threaten the boys zone.

30:10.360 --> 30:10.680
Yeah.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.520
Are they covered in ink?

30:16.360 --> 30:17.720
I don't believe so.

30:17.720 --> 30:21.400
No, are they like 17th century poets?

30:22.360 --> 30:25.800
Here, I can give you another clue.

30:27.080 --> 30:28.600
It's from Dirty Diana.

30:28.600 --> 30:29.960
So that's mystery one solved.

30:29.960 --> 30:30.680
Okay.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.480
Who says, best answer by the way.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.400
I see Ronan and he says,

30:35.400 --> 30:37.160
you look gorgeous tonight.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.320
I blush as he bites his bottom lip.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.160
Then the rest is left to the imagination.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.120
I'll get reported.

30:42.120 --> 30:45.640
LMAO, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.600
So that would be laughing my ass off.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.480
There it goes.

30:49.480 --> 30:50.840
It's just flopping across the floor.

30:50.840 --> 30:54.040
So when he bites his lip

30:54.040 --> 30:55.960
and the rest that's left of the imagination

30:55.960 --> 30:57.160
is he eats his lip.

30:57.160 --> 30:57.480
Yeah.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.680
Some ink dribbles out.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.400
The ink dribbles out of his mouth.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.640
And this is, there's a Ronan in the group.

31:03.640 --> 31:04.040
There is.

31:04.920 --> 31:07.000
It's like a samurai without a master, right?

31:07.000 --> 31:12.680
Is that the Ronan?

31:12.680 --> 31:15.400
I'm going to reevaluate my standing still.

31:15.400 --> 31:18.040
I don't believe that'll be a match for the Ronan skills.

31:18.040 --> 31:18.360
Yeah.

31:19.720 --> 31:21.240
He's trained for that sort of thing.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.920
You all aren't even considering the possibility.

31:24.920 --> 31:26.920
It's a good thing that maybe the boys zone

31:26.920 --> 31:30.920
is just a fun place where boys can go and be boys in their zone.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.960
Well, if I'm allowed to be a boy.

31:33.960 --> 31:34.760
Final answer.

31:34.760 --> 31:37.720
What do you do when confronted with the boys zone, Travis?

31:37.720 --> 31:39.960
I'd probably start screaming for my parents.

31:40.840 --> 31:41.800
Out of?

31:41.800 --> 31:42.680
Huh?

31:42.680 --> 31:43.160
Fear?

31:43.160 --> 31:44.120
Excitement?

31:45.160 --> 31:46.440
Probably concern.

31:46.440 --> 31:47.000
Okay.

31:47.000 --> 31:47.960
Justin.

31:47.960 --> 31:57.160
I would, I would ask for their autograph on their CD.

31:57.160 --> 31:58.600
Justin wins!

31:58.600 --> 31:59.160
Oh!

32:01.080 --> 32:02.520
They're an Irish boy band.

32:03.320 --> 32:03.720
Okay.

32:03.720 --> 32:07.000
They were active 1993 to 2000.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.640
Wow, they got a fucking ahead of the game, huh?

32:09.640 --> 32:11.080
They got in and they got out.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.360
And then they got in because they're active now, 2007 to present.

32:14.360 --> 32:15.880
It's a man band now.

32:15.880 --> 32:16.360
Yes.

32:16.360 --> 32:17.800
It's a man zone.

32:17.800 --> 32:18.680
Man zone.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.120
Welcome to man place.

32:23.240 --> 32:24.280
Thank you for playing my game.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.560
I got so excited.

32:25.560 --> 32:28.440
I saw a boy zone and I instantly bookmarked it.

32:28.440 --> 32:29.400
I didn't even need to think fucking twice.

32:29.400 --> 32:32.760
Do you have any information vis-a-vis pets and birds?

32:32.760 --> 32:33.400
Oh, no.

32:34.600 --> 32:34.840
What?

32:34.840 --> 32:37.000
Pets and birds, ink, lots of stuff.

32:37.000 --> 32:37.960
The ink was unclear.

32:37.960 --> 32:40.360
The ink is a huge part of this.

32:40.360 --> 32:40.600
Yep.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.400
Because you would see the ink and think,

32:43.400 --> 32:45.160
maybe this will lead me to boy zone.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.880
Listen, we spent way too long on boy zone and I can admit that.

32:48.440 --> 32:50.280
What's the next question, Justin?

32:50.280 --> 32:55.000
Last year, my partner and I bought a house with a large Mickey Mouse sculpture mailbox.

32:56.200 --> 33:01.000
I don't like it very much, but I don't know how to get rid of slash destroy it.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.240
I also kind of feel bad removing it as the previous owner sculpted it themselves.

33:06.680 --> 33:10.040
Any suggestions on how to deal with this massive mouse?

33:10.600 --> 33:13.240
And it says picture attached for scale.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.120
Let me see that bad boy.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.200
From too much mouse in Broomfield.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.360
I'm going to show it to y'all.

33:18.360 --> 33:22.440
You're not going to be able to see great, but it is, it's a, the size.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.760
Oh, it's the size of a full grown man.

33:24.760 --> 33:27.240
Size of a full grown man.

33:27.240 --> 33:31.160
And it seems to be made of stone.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.920
When I was reading this question initially, I thought,

33:35.880 --> 33:38.680
stop asking us questions that can be fixed by spin kicks.

33:39.240 --> 33:42.920
If you can spin kick it away, don't bring it to our desk.

33:42.920 --> 33:45.560
You would just break your fucking foot.

33:45.560 --> 33:45.960
Yeah.

33:45.960 --> 33:49.640
It's a very large mouse and it's a Fantasia era Mickey,

33:49.640 --> 33:52.360
which is among his most powerful forms.

33:52.360 --> 33:52.860
Sure.

33:52.860 --> 33:56.860
I will, I will say that's it.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.460
That's, you're going to have to move friendo.

33:59.020 --> 34:00.220
Credit where credit is due.

34:00.220 --> 34:02.060
It's a well sculpted Mickey.

34:02.060 --> 34:02.940
That's great.

34:02.940 --> 34:07.020
But I will point out the mailbox seems like kind of an afterthought.

34:07.020 --> 34:07.260
Sure.

34:08.620 --> 34:10.460
It's not in his belly or anything.

34:10.460 --> 34:11.900
Just one quick correction.

34:11.900 --> 34:15.340
You did say that it was your house.

34:15.340 --> 34:19.900
I believe if you really think about it, it is the statue of Mickey Mouse's house.

34:19.900 --> 34:22.220
It is the, it is the house of mouse you could say.

34:22.220 --> 34:26.540
And you live in the Mickey Mouse clubhouse and I'm, I'm really sorry about that.

34:26.540 --> 34:27.980
Are you here by the way?

34:27.980 --> 34:28.300
Hold on.

34:28.300 --> 34:28.860
Wait, are you here?

34:29.580 --> 34:30.140
Hello.

34:30.140 --> 34:30.460
Hello.

34:30.460 --> 34:36.380
Yeah, not to play along, but you did see it when you first considered buying the house, right?

34:36.940 --> 34:38.700
It didn't surprise you.

34:38.700 --> 34:41.820
You can't say no because you can see it from space.

34:44.060 --> 34:46.780
You probably thought, well, certainly they'll take that with them.

34:47.660 --> 34:50.940
There's no reason they would leave behind this beautiful art of the mouse.

34:50.940 --> 34:52.620
They would want to take it to their next home.

34:54.620 --> 34:55.980
Could you, here's a thought.

34:55.980 --> 34:56.380
Yes.

34:56.380 --> 35:04.460
Could you have the city redraw the bounds of your property so that the mouse is no longer.

35:04.460 --> 35:05.740
Just sort of, dude.

35:05.740 --> 35:08.540
The mouse becomes a small park at this point.

35:08.540 --> 35:09.820
Oh yeah, a pocket park.

35:09.820 --> 35:11.100
No longer your problem.

35:11.100 --> 35:12.380
It's just a local park.

35:12.380 --> 35:12.940
Ooh.

35:12.940 --> 35:15.260
As long as we're coming up with ideas for having the city fix it.

35:15.260 --> 35:23.500
If you carve a ding dong onto Mickey Mouse, I don't think the city will let it exist there sort of street side.

35:23.500 --> 35:24.380
Dickey Mouse.

35:24.380 --> 35:25.900
I feel like Travis is just.

35:32.540 --> 35:37.500
Could you call Disney and tell them there's a copyright violation in your yard?

35:37.500 --> 35:37.740
Yes.

35:39.420 --> 35:40.220
Yes.

35:40.220 --> 35:41.980
It seems like they'd take care of it.

35:41.980 --> 35:44.620
And maybe you.

35:44.620 --> 35:50.620
If they don't, you have to start building other Disney themed mailboxes next to it.

35:50.620 --> 35:53.260
Until it's just like, they can't ignore it anymore.

35:53.260 --> 35:59.820
Once you got fucking Ant Man and Baloo the bear and all the, you know.

35:59.820 --> 36:01.020
All the hit characters.

36:01.020 --> 36:02.460
All the great Disney characters.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.460
Yeah, all the main Disney stays.

36:04.460 --> 36:05.740
The big Disney, the big names.

36:05.740 --> 36:11.020
Mickey, Ant Man, Baloo, Lilo, Stitch, whatever.

36:11.020 --> 36:15.420
It's a big mailbox though.

36:20.060 --> 36:20.380
Yeah.

36:20.380 --> 36:25.100
Hey, I kept the picture up because I didn't want this to become a joke to me.

36:25.100 --> 36:30.460
I needed it to stay real because there's real people that are affected by this very large mouse.

36:30.460 --> 36:32.860
Hey, what are you going to do?

36:33.500 --> 36:34.620
Yeah, but really.

36:34.620 --> 36:36.460
It's a big fucking mailbox.

36:36.460 --> 36:41.500
I'm going to go fly home to West Virginia tomorrow and you're still going to have this mouse.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.940
We can make a lot of jokes up here, but.

36:42.940 --> 36:45.100
It's a lot of fun and you're expensive.

36:45.100 --> 36:46.620
The mouse will still remain.

36:47.260 --> 36:49.820
The mouse will be there long after you die.

36:49.820 --> 36:50.620
Yeah, a lot.

36:50.620 --> 36:52.380
Nothing will move this mouse.

36:52.380 --> 36:53.740
Yeah, good luck.

36:53.740 --> 36:56.620
Oh, do you want a water feature in your front yard?

36:56.620 --> 37:01.340
If so, maybe just some sort of ramp that pushes the water upwards.

37:01.340 --> 37:03.660
We'll have to get some sort of engineers.

37:03.660 --> 37:04.540
I'm not one.

37:04.540 --> 37:11.900
That just slowly drips water down onto the Mickey statue over a period of millennia.

37:13.260 --> 37:18.540
If you're like me, a lazy person, you probably looked at that mouse and you bought the house

37:18.540 --> 37:20.620
and thought, I like Mickey.

37:24.140 --> 37:24.700
I'll learn.

37:24.700 --> 37:30.860
I'll learn to get into Mickey more so that I could be someone with a affection commiserate

37:30.860 --> 37:35.900
with this size and heft of a statue surrounding my mailbox.

37:37.260 --> 37:38.220
You probably blow it up.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.940
Blow it up with a bomb.

37:40.940 --> 37:41.500
Blow it up.

37:41.500 --> 37:42.540
Just the thing you could do.

37:42.540 --> 37:43.980
I've watched a lot of Mythbusters.

37:44.620 --> 37:45.420
I would imagine.

37:45.420 --> 37:47.980
You call the Mythbusters, say like, hey, I got a myth.

37:49.020 --> 37:53.980
Can you blow up a Mickey mailbox any which way?

37:55.980 --> 37:56.940
Challenge accepted.

37:56.940 --> 37:57.820
I got him again.

37:57.820 --> 38:02.060
Can you take my, it's a myth, can you take my trash out?

38:04.620 --> 38:13.020
I don't know what the connotation is, but I have to imagine that this mailbox has become

38:13.020 --> 38:15.420
extremely significant to your mail carrier.

38:16.620 --> 38:22.220
This is either how they start their day, end their day, a good like, well, I'm one-third done.

38:22.220 --> 38:23.020
There's Mickey.

38:23.900 --> 38:24.300
I know.

38:25.020 --> 38:26.140
Time for lunch.

38:26.140 --> 38:27.580
I'm so tired, but...

38:27.580 --> 38:29.100
I'm one step closer to Mickey.

38:29.100 --> 38:33.980
I do get to see Mickey at the end of my day, and I do love that zany mouse.

38:33.980 --> 38:34.620
There's also...

38:35.580 --> 38:39.660
And then the day he delivers the bomb, you will use to explode the Mickey statue.

38:39.660 --> 38:42.380
It will be the sweetest, coolest irony of his life.

38:45.580 --> 38:48.940
There's a very good chance that they sold this house because of the Mickey.

38:52.300 --> 38:54.060
I didn't mean to build it so big.

38:54.060 --> 38:59.020
He's, whoever the owner was started carving it and then finished was like, what have I done?

39:00.700 --> 39:02.540
This was supposed to be Goofy.

39:03.020 --> 39:04.860
I did such a bad job.

39:05.420 --> 39:07.580
You don't want to fucking give Goofy your mail.

39:07.580 --> 39:12.780
Listen, guys, my son became a big fan of that whole universe when we went to Disney earlier this year.

39:12.780 --> 39:15.340
You cannot trust Goofy with mail.

39:15.340 --> 39:19.900
That dude can't accomplish anything without showing his whole ass.

39:21.900 --> 39:22.860
Can I do a yahoo?

39:22.860 --> 39:24.140
Can I do a yahoo?

39:25.180 --> 39:25.500
Yeah.

39:26.460 --> 39:28.780
This one was sent in by Nathan's...

39:28.780 --> 39:30.700
Justin, I feel like you're still distracted by how big the mailbox is.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.860
You're really looking at the big Mickey statue.

39:32.860 --> 39:35.180
It's so big, it'll be there tomorrow.

39:41.900 --> 39:42.860
Here's one sent in by...

39:43.500 --> 39:43.900
All right.

39:43.900 --> 39:51.580
Consider the possibility.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.860
You might find the yahoo enjoyable also.

39:57.820 --> 39:59.100
It was sent in by Nathan Smith.

39:59.100 --> 39:59.660
I'm going to have to take two.

39:59.660 --> 40:00.620
Yeah, turn it off.

40:00.620 --> 40:01.500
Yeah, thank you.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.300
Oh, give me this.

40:10.300 --> 40:12.620
Yeah, Nathan Smith sent this in.

40:12.620 --> 40:14.860
Thank you, Nathan. It's an anonymous yahoo answers user.

40:14.860 --> 40:16.380
I'm going to call Dickie who asks...

40:24.540 --> 40:30.780
Is a vegan allowed to eat extremely wafer-thin ham?

40:30.780 --> 40:40.300
Now, listen.

40:45.260 --> 40:48.780
Listen, your gut instinct is going to say,

40:50.140 --> 40:50.380
no.

40:52.860 --> 40:53.580
The ham.

40:54.380 --> 40:56.940
What if I told you I can get it so fucking thin?

40:56.940 --> 41:01.820
You could put it in front of you and hold it with both hands and blow,

41:01.820 --> 41:03.820
and it would turn into a bubble and fly away.

41:03.820 --> 41:04.940
So thin, this ham.

41:05.660 --> 41:07.580
Could you hide it in other vegetables?

41:07.580 --> 41:07.980
It was so thin.

41:07.980 --> 41:09.180
No, it can't be a trick.

41:09.180 --> 41:12.540
They have to mindfully eat the thin ham.

41:13.100 --> 41:16.460
They will say, I can't do this with anything else.

41:17.020 --> 41:18.620
This ham's so fucking thin.

41:18.620 --> 41:20.780
I can see my friends through it.

41:20.780 --> 41:22.460
I can see you through it.

41:22.460 --> 41:23.660
It's the thinnest ham.

41:24.540 --> 41:25.900
Barely there ham.

41:25.900 --> 41:29.580
There is a thinness of ham where statistically speaking,

41:29.580 --> 41:31.420
you're not even really eating ham.

41:31.420 --> 41:32.220
Yes.

41:32.220 --> 41:32.700
Yes.

41:32.700 --> 41:34.460
You're inhaling ham.

41:34.460 --> 41:36.220
You're breathing ham in.

41:36.220 --> 41:36.700
Yeah.

41:36.700 --> 41:39.020
No, that's got to have some chew to it.

41:39.020 --> 41:42.220
Yeah, and the ham flavor that makes it so delicious and desirable.

41:42.220 --> 41:43.420
Will be present.

41:43.420 --> 41:47.420
Is there a thinness of ham that you could walk through it like a cobweb

41:47.420 --> 41:48.540
and get some in your mouth?

41:49.980 --> 41:51.500
Who hung all this ham here?

41:52.300 --> 41:55.180
This is Travis's fucked up reboot of Charlotte's Web

41:55.180 --> 41:56.380
where they switch places.

41:59.900 --> 42:01.100
Oh, that was some pig.

42:02.940 --> 42:06.620
Your fucking ceiling pig has written cool spider and ham.

42:09.980 --> 42:12.620
This is a thinness of ham where Wilbur should be able

42:12.620 --> 42:14.380
to peel them off of himself.

42:14.940 --> 42:16.140
Okay, that's it.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.940
This is cruelty free.

42:18.940 --> 42:19.580
We are talking-

42:19.580 --> 42:22.060
Well, a little cruel.

42:22.060 --> 42:22.380
No.

42:22.380 --> 42:24.380
You are shaving a pig.

42:24.380 --> 42:25.580
No, you get it.

42:25.580 --> 42:26.780
It's cruelty free.

42:26.780 --> 42:30.460
It's like peelings, like sunburn, you know?

42:31.660 --> 42:35.740
Get some pumice stone in the pig pen, whatever they rub off.

42:35.740 --> 42:37.180
Ham dandruff, basically.

42:37.180 --> 42:38.220
It's ham dandruff.

42:38.220 --> 42:39.020
Ham dandruff, yes.

42:39.020 --> 42:41.340
It's pressed ham dandruff, basically.

42:42.380 --> 42:42.940
Fine.

42:42.940 --> 42:45.420
I need you all to take over the show for 10 minutes

42:45.420 --> 42:50.780
while I write out the entire spec script to Wilbur's ham zone

42:50.780 --> 42:55.420
because my mind is just racing with possibilities.

42:57.660 --> 43:01.020
The farmers would not like the huge spider in their barn.

43:01.660 --> 43:05.900
Wilbur would have a pretty tough road to hoe ahead of him.

43:05.900 --> 43:09.180
Listen, we got to do a pretty strong BR campaign here.

43:09.980 --> 43:10.460
Get the gun.

43:10.460 --> 43:12.060
There's a big monster spider in the barn.

43:12.060 --> 43:13.900
What's it saying ham up there?

43:13.900 --> 43:14.620
No, don't.

43:14.620 --> 43:15.980
Think of the tax benefits?

43:15.980 --> 43:17.420
Shit, I didn't think about that.

43:17.420 --> 43:22.540
What's it saying the ham up there is one of the best sentences I've ever heard.

43:22.540 --> 43:23.500
Wait, hold on.

43:23.500 --> 43:25.580
Let's read the ham first, John.

43:25.580 --> 43:26.060
Read the ham.

43:26.060 --> 43:26.860
What's it say?

43:26.860 --> 43:29.740
It's blood is acidic and will get on you and you'll die.

43:29.740 --> 43:30.460
Damn, all right.

43:30.460 --> 43:31.900
Can't shoot the spider yet.

43:31.900 --> 43:34.140
Thanks for the warning, ceiling pig.

43:34.140 --> 43:37.260
The ham up there is my favorite movie starring Kevin Bacon.

43:38.300 --> 43:41.500
Hey, there was two.

43:41.500 --> 43:51.500
There's two in it.

43:55.500 --> 43:59.500
These guys too much, too much, too fast.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.660
These guys, these are they real brothers?

44:02.300 --> 44:06.220
You know, I've heard that it's all a government conspiracy.

44:07.340 --> 44:10.300
Speaking of a government conspiracy for your genitals,

44:10.300 --> 44:12.540

And once you finish putting a Santa Claus on your duff,

45:09.420 --> 45:13.180
why don't you go to Stitch Fix and put something on over those nasty things.

45:15.420 --> 45:16.700
Hey, Stitch Fix is good.

45:16.700 --> 45:19.500
It's an online personal styling service that finds and delivers

45:19.500 --> 45:22.460
clothes, shoes, and accessories that fit your body budget and lifestyle.

45:22.460 --> 45:29.980
I gotta say, my shopper, my stylist has really dialed in on my shit.

45:30.540 --> 45:35.260
Not only on my styles, but the fit on everything has been so choice lately.

45:35.260 --> 45:39.900
They helped me realize, Justin, my legs are considerably shorter than I used to think they

45:39.900 --> 45:40.300
were.

45:40.300 --> 45:43.900
I would wear those jeans and I would get the holes at the bottoms of them like a skater.

45:43.900 --> 45:46.380
Then it's because my freaking pant legs were too long.

45:46.380 --> 45:49.340
They helped me dial that shit in and now my clothes fit better than ever.

45:50.140 --> 45:51.020
So it's great.

45:51.020 --> 45:52.860
You go to stitchfix.com slash my brother.

46:29.100 --> 46:33.180
We hope you're enjoying yourself with this delightful episode.

46:33.180 --> 46:35.660
And thank you for listening.

46:35.660 --> 46:36.300
We appreciate you.

46:36.300 --> 46:38.780
Thank you to Denver for coming out.

46:38.780 --> 46:41.740
It was one of the most rowdy shows we've done in a long time.

46:41.740 --> 46:43.020
And it was a lot of fun.

46:43.020 --> 46:44.060
We have a new website.

46:44.060 --> 46:47.580
We are going to keep talking about it for, I don't know, a little bit until people get

46:47.580 --> 46:49.100
sick of it, which may be now.

46:49.100 --> 46:53.820
But if you go to mackleroy.family or the mackleroy.family, you can find our website.

46:53.820 --> 46:56.300
It's we teamed up with Vox to make it.

46:56.300 --> 47:01.660
We're still on the Max Fun Network, and in fact, all of the shows we do on Max Fun and

47:01.660 --> 47:04.780
off are on mackleroy.family.

47:04.780 --> 47:05.580
You can find them there.

47:05.580 --> 47:08.060
You can find new merch announcements.

47:08.060 --> 47:09.420
And you can find general news.

47:09.420 --> 47:13.900
Like for instance, this week we're probably going to be announcing an upcoming tour.

47:13.900 --> 47:22.140
So keep an eye on mackleroy.family to find out more and also our social channels.

47:23.580 --> 47:24.460
Thanks for listening.

47:24.460 --> 47:26.620
And we'll be back with you again soon.

47:26.620 --> 47:27.120
Bye.

47:28.300 --> 47:30.300
Hello, Maximum Fun.

47:30.300 --> 47:34.460
I am Oliver Wong, scholar, journalist, DJ, et cetera.

47:34.460 --> 47:35.260
And I'm Morgan Rold.

47:35.260 --> 47:37.820
I'm a music supervisor who loves stilettos.

47:37.820 --> 47:42.620
We host Heat Rocks, a music podcast where we talk to influential artists and scholars

47:42.620 --> 47:45.500
about the albums that changed their lives.

47:45.500 --> 47:50.380
On our most recent episode, we had the chance to talk with none other than R&B legend Macy

47:50.380 --> 47:56.780
Gray about one of her favorite albums, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Yeezy.

47:56.780 --> 48:02.380
We get deep talking about everything from Kanye's college dropout days all the way up

48:02.380 --> 48:04.780
to his most recent shenanigans.

48:04.780 --> 48:07.740
I just think it's weak, and I don't think he has to do that.

48:07.740 --> 48:09.420
And I was just disappointed.

48:09.420 --> 48:15.100
So make sure you, dear listener, are subscribed because you definitely do not want to miss

48:15.100 --> 48:16.220
this conversation.

48:16.220 --> 48:20.940
Heat Rocks every Thursday right here on Maximum Fun.

48:20.940 --> 48:23.020
Uh, how about another question?

48:23.020 --> 48:23.900
Yeah, another guy.

48:30.140 --> 48:31.100
Just start reading it.

48:31.100 --> 48:55.020
Here is one sent in.

48:55.020 --> 48:56.380
No, no, you'll mess me up.

48:57.340 --> 48:59.580
It's like rhythmless, free form kind of.

48:59.580 --> 49:06.060
Okay.

49:06.060 --> 49:10.060
I want a Munch Squad!

49:10.060 --> 49:15.180
I want to Munch Squad!

49:15.180 --> 49:16.060
Welcome to Munch Squad.

49:19.420 --> 49:27.500
The only podcast segment within a built-in cocktail artist, Paul Saborin.

49:27.500 --> 49:31.820
I like that Paul said I shouldn't bring Justin a full bottle of liquor while he's doing the

49:31.820 --> 49:34.380
stinger for Munch Squad because who knows what might happen.

49:34.380 --> 49:39.980
Hey, big ups to Denver hooked your boy up with the Hennessy VSOP privilege.

49:40.700 --> 49:41.180
Thank you.

49:42.700 --> 49:44.300
We still got a lot of show left.

49:44.300 --> 49:51.340
Sonic, ads, Fritos, chili cheese faves, starting at 99 cents.

49:51.340 --> 49:55.980
You know, folks, if something's your fave, the price should be immaterial.

49:55.980 --> 50:03.340
If it's truly your chili cheese fave, you shouldn't need that 99 cents to be appended there.

50:03.340 --> 50:05.420
It could be 70, 80 dollars.

50:05.420 --> 50:07.340
You still buy it because it's your fave.

50:07.340 --> 50:13.580
But starting at just 99 cents, guests can order the Sonic Fritos chili pie and Fritos

50:13.580 --> 50:18.140
chili cheese junior wrap along with the Fritos Fritos chili cheese.

50:18.140 --> 50:19.660
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

50:19.660 --> 50:22.300
You can't, you can't have possibly said that correctly.

50:22.300 --> 50:22.780
Sorry.

50:22.780 --> 50:23.260
That can't be it.

50:23.260 --> 50:25.180
Travis, can please confirm?

50:25.180 --> 50:30.700
Fuck the Fritos Fritos chili cheese junior burger.

50:30.700 --> 50:33.500
The Fritos Fritos chili burger burger.

50:36.140 --> 50:39.980
This is when the Munch Squad robot became sentient and insane.

50:41.100 --> 50:44.540
Fritos Fritos chili cheese junior burger.

50:44.540 --> 50:46.860
That's starting at 199, folks.

50:46.860 --> 50:51.180
Sonic, human beings would have to order that with their mouth and eat it.

50:51.180 --> 50:54.540
Frito Frito chili chili cheese burger burger burger.

50:54.540 --> 50:56.220
We didn't start the fire.

51:03.660 --> 51:06.460
Yeah, Sonic Drive-In is taking the quirky.

51:07.100 --> 51:09.180
That word doesn't mean fucking anything anymore.

51:10.060 --> 51:16.460
The quirky comforting flavors of a beloved snack and making it available for any location

51:16.460 --> 51:22.940
any time by adding new Fritos chili cheese options to a variety of menu items with at

51:22.940 --> 51:29.100
least three ways to add a warm, salty and savory crunch to any meal.

51:29.740 --> 51:34.780
The new Sonic Fritos chili cheese faves started just 99 cents.

51:34.780 --> 51:36.380
So what are these faves?

51:36.380 --> 51:41.500
Well, the Fritos chili pie is made with crunchy Fritos,

51:41.500 --> 51:44.860
savory chili and topped with melty cheddar cheese.

51:44.860 --> 51:45.180
Good.

51:47.340 --> 51:48.460
I know this friend.

51:48.460 --> 51:50.380
This friend I'm familiar with and I enjoy his work.

51:50.380 --> 51:54.620
The Fritos chili cheese junior wrap includes the same delicious ingredients

51:54.620 --> 51:57.100
bundled up in an eight inch flour tortilla.

51:57.100 --> 51:57.420
Stop.

51:59.420 --> 52:01.500
To create a perfect bite every time.

52:02.220 --> 52:04.780
In whose mouth is this a perfect bite?

52:04.780 --> 52:05.420
Shrek?

52:05.420 --> 52:09.820
The Fritos the Fritos chili cheese junior burger.

52:09.820 --> 52:15.980
OK, so the name of the menu item is not actually apparently the Fritos Fritos chili cheese junior

52:15.980 --> 52:19.660
burger, but I think it is very indicative of the person who ran this press release.

52:19.660 --> 52:20.620
They looked at the name of it.

52:20.620 --> 52:24.460
They think there's got to be some more Fritos in there somewhere.

52:24.460 --> 52:25.340
It doesn't look right.

52:25.340 --> 52:28.700
I want to put another Fritos at the beginning and see if that does it anyway.

52:28.700 --> 52:31.180
The Fritos chili cheese junior burger is made with Fritos,

52:31.820 --> 52:37.420
chili and melty cheddar cheese on top of juicy 100 percent beef patty.

52:37.980 --> 52:45.580
I like the 100 percent beef patty because that indicates the person is really obsessed

52:45.580 --> 52:48.780
with making sure their meat is all natural with no filler

52:48.780 --> 52:51.900
or and they just are going to put some Fritos on top of it.

52:54.140 --> 52:56.460
So sandwich between a soft bakery bun.

52:56.460 --> 52:57.580
Cool bakery you got there.

52:58.140 --> 53:00.140
What are you going to use the buns for?

53:00.140 --> 53:06.060
Well, I'm going to slop some chips in there and then some other trash and sell it for a dollar.

53:06.060 --> 53:06.700
I don't know.

53:06.700 --> 53:07.980
I'm not a very good baker.

53:09.500 --> 53:11.580
My father is very disappointed in me.

53:11.580 --> 53:16.780
And you can amp up a Sonic classic by creating one more option

53:16.780 --> 53:19.740
by adding Fritos to the chili cheese coney.

53:19.740 --> 53:20.860
That's right, folks.

53:20.860 --> 53:23.660
You can go fucking off menu and just be like,

53:23.660 --> 53:25.260
is there anything else you can put Fritos in?

53:25.980 --> 53:28.060
Because I'm crazy about these little corn chips.

53:29.180 --> 53:29.980
So here's the quote.

53:30.780 --> 53:34.940
It's from Scott Yulin, vice president of product innovation and development for Sonic.

53:35.820 --> 53:41.660
Quote, the bold flavor combination of crispy Fritos with mouthwatering chili

53:41.660 --> 53:47.740
and melty cheese is both incredibly classic and unique at the same time.

53:49.100 --> 53:50.540
Hey, Scott, what are we doing here?

53:50.540 --> 53:51.340
What are we playing at?

53:52.220 --> 53:54.460
Scott, what are we doing?

53:56.140 --> 54:00.780
Adding quote, adding the uniquely delicious and salty bite of Fritos.

54:03.180 --> 54:05.180
They're fucking Fritos.

54:05.180 --> 54:12.300
Adding the Fritos flavored Fritos from Fritos that you know as Fritos.

54:13.180 --> 54:14.620
Dylan, it's Scott.

54:14.620 --> 54:15.980
I need you to come into my office.

54:15.980 --> 54:20.860
But when you come, bring every word if anyone's ever written about Fritos,

54:20.860 --> 54:24.940
because I need to find some other things to say about Fritos.

54:24.940 --> 54:27.580
I'm not an expert, but the way that sentence is constructed,

54:27.580 --> 54:33.260
it does say uniquely something and, but that would be uniquely salty taste of Fritos.

54:33.260 --> 54:36.620
Like you would taste the salt of Fritos and be like, that's a salt I've never had before.

54:36.620 --> 54:38.220
Is this Himalayan sea salt?

54:38.220 --> 54:39.340
This is incredible.

54:39.900 --> 54:43.660
The uniquely salty bite of Fritos, chili and cheese

54:44.220 --> 54:46.940
was something many had had to hack menus to get.

54:48.460 --> 54:50.460
Thank you, you brave pioneers.

54:51.820 --> 54:52.380
And now people-

54:52.380 --> 54:54.620
Some even had to bring their own Fritos.

54:54.620 --> 54:55.660
Unbelievable.

54:55.660 --> 55:01.980
People can, now people can order their faves in three craveable ways, right from their cars.

55:01.980 --> 55:04.620
That's it, that's it.

55:04.620 --> 55:07.660
You got to, they want you to eat this in your car.

55:08.460 --> 55:13.420
That's the same one that you're going to drive your spouse to when they deliver your first child

55:14.060 --> 55:17.500
and you're going to eat a Frito pie in there on a hamburger,

55:17.500 --> 55:20.780
on French fries, on a corn dog, on a milkshake.

55:20.780 --> 55:22.540
That you're going to eat that in your own car.

55:23.340 --> 55:25.980
And, you know, starting at just 99 cents,

55:25.980 --> 55:30.860
guests can order the Sonic Fritos chili pie and Fritos chili cheese junior wrap

55:30.860 --> 55:32.300
along with the Fritos.

55:33.020 --> 55:36.380
Okay, now here it says Fritos Fritos chili cheese junior burger.

55:36.380 --> 55:38.300
Okay, that's two out of three folks.

55:38.300 --> 55:41.660
It's called the Fritos Fritos chili cheese junior burger.

55:41.660 --> 55:45.180
That's starting at 199 while supplies last.

55:45.180 --> 55:47.980
Get in there and get those three craveable-

55:47.980 --> 55:53.020
Hey folks, if you ever find yourself as part of your job writing the word craveable,

55:54.540 --> 55:55.100
go home.

55:56.940 --> 55:58.700
Donate everything you own to charity.

55:58.700 --> 56:02.620
And walk the world doing good for others.

56:02.620 --> 56:04.780
Because you have so much to atone for.

56:06.380 --> 56:08.140
You have to start now.

56:08.140 --> 56:11.820
You've gone horribly awry and you have to fix it all right now.

56:12.700 --> 56:15.660
And anyway, that's the latest and greatest from Sonic.

56:15.660 --> 56:16.460
They talk-

56:16.460 --> 56:17.260
Thank you for listening.

56:17.260 --> 56:18.780
Thank you, Sonic.

56:18.780 --> 56:21.180
They talk a lot in there about the different ways

56:21.900 --> 56:25.340
without ever saying you could just order some Fritos if you want them.

56:25.340 --> 56:27.180
What if I just want a bag full of Fritos?

56:27.180 --> 56:32.060
Tim shits. Maybe you could buy a bag of Fritos and put them on wherever the fuck you want.

56:32.060 --> 56:34.940
Like you don't have to come to Sonic to get Fritos.

56:35.660 --> 56:37.260
Just bring your own Fritos.

56:37.820 --> 56:39.660
Let's do the audience questions.

56:39.660 --> 56:40.140
How about that?

56:40.140 --> 56:40.780
Yeah.

56:40.780 --> 56:41.280
Do not-

56:42.460 --> 56:43.420
Let's get those highlights up.

56:43.420 --> 56:43.900
Don't get up.

56:43.900 --> 56:45.100
We have a new way of doing this.

56:45.100 --> 56:45.900
I don't say-

56:45.900 --> 56:49.100
This is our first show in Denver, which by the way, sorry.

56:51.900 --> 56:52.940
You should come sooner.

56:52.940 --> 56:53.980
Yeah, we should come here soon.

56:53.980 --> 56:54.860
You guys are great.

56:54.860 --> 56:58.060
Hey Nick, what do you do with bread, pal?

56:58.060 --> 56:58.620
Okay.

56:58.620 --> 57:03.420
So I take about sometimes four to five slices of bread

57:03.420 --> 57:09.580
and just like mash them up into a ball and just eat it like it's a big apple.

57:09.580 --> 57:09.900
Yes.

57:12.700 --> 57:12.940
The problem is-

57:12.940 --> 57:16.060
I saw someone behind you enthusiastically like, yes.

57:16.700 --> 57:17.740
Good, yes.

57:17.740 --> 57:17.980
Good.

57:21.740 --> 57:22.620
Wait, and what's the-

57:22.620 --> 57:24.780
That's just a statement of fact of what you do.

57:25.500 --> 57:27.020
What do you need our help with?

57:28.220 --> 57:29.580
How do I not do that?

57:29.580 --> 57:30.140
Yeah, why do you-

57:30.140 --> 57:30.460
Okay.

57:32.460 --> 57:37.100
I did this when I was in elementary school and you get the school rolls.

57:37.100 --> 57:37.500
Oh yeah.

57:37.500 --> 57:42.060
I would take the bread meat out of the husk

57:43.100 --> 57:46.300
and I would roll the bread meat back into its dough state.

57:46.300 --> 57:49.980
You're returning it ashes to ashes, dough to dough.

57:49.980 --> 57:53.820
Returning the bread to its dough state and then I would eat it in that state.

57:53.820 --> 57:54.620
And you know what?

57:55.180 --> 57:55.900
It was good.

57:55.900 --> 57:56.380
It was good.

57:56.380 --> 57:58.220
It was like a little gumball of bread.

57:59.100 --> 58:01.740
Nick, do you often find yourself like rolling the bread out thinking like,

58:01.740 --> 58:03.020
what am I doing?

58:03.020 --> 58:03.500
No.

58:04.700 --> 58:09.580
It's a process because most of the time I kind of just peel off the crust first

58:09.580 --> 58:11.180
and then eat that and then-

58:11.180 --> 58:12.540
Oh Jesus Christ, man.

58:12.540 --> 58:13.580
Okay, come on.

58:13.580 --> 58:15.340
No, I won't fucking come on.

58:15.340 --> 58:16.780
You come on.

58:16.780 --> 58:18.780
Back to the light of reason.

58:18.780 --> 58:19.340
Of reason.

58:20.220 --> 58:20.700
Can I-

58:20.700 --> 58:22.140
But like, it's-

58:22.140 --> 58:23.420
What do you like about this?

58:23.420 --> 58:24.540
It's chewier.

58:25.900 --> 58:26.780
It's chewier.

58:26.780 --> 58:27.660
Okay, wait.

58:28.780 --> 58:30.620
It's all the same bread, right?

58:30.620 --> 58:32.220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

58:32.220 --> 58:35.740
In wadding it up, you've changed the-

58:35.740 --> 58:37.340
Whose side are you on?

58:37.340 --> 58:39.900
I'm turning over to Nick's side actually because I'm thinking about it.

58:40.780 --> 58:44.060
Do you watch like Great British Bake Off whenever like Paul Hollywood-

58:44.060 --> 58:45.740
Yeah, I do.

58:45.740 --> 58:49.020
Whenever Paul Hollywood is like, this is leaden and stodgy.

58:49.020 --> 58:52.540
You see that and you're like, fuck, send it over this way, Paul.

58:52.540 --> 58:53.820
This has no air in it.

58:53.820 --> 58:55.500
You didn't let it rise and you're like, yum, yum.

58:55.500 --> 58:58.060
Give me some of that bad bread, Paul Hollywood.

58:58.060 --> 59:02.940
I wish every once in a while Paul Hollywood would take four or five slices of the baker's

59:02.940 --> 59:05.820
treat and roll into a ball and eat it like an apple.

59:05.820 --> 59:07.340
With his big hands.

59:07.340 --> 59:10.860
I can't really taste it unless I do it the traditional British way.

59:13.100 --> 59:14.940
No, okay, hold on.

59:14.940 --> 59:18.540
There's an element of this question where Nick is saying, how do I stop doing this?

59:18.540 --> 59:19.740
And you're both like, nah.

59:19.740 --> 59:21.420
Don't, dude, it's to chase your bliss.

59:21.420 --> 59:24.060
The question wasn't, I do this and I love it.

59:24.060 --> 59:25.180
How do I keep doing it?

59:25.180 --> 59:28.860
I used to dip into the pepperoni bag in the refrigerator and pull some out and put it

59:28.860 --> 59:30.700
in a single slice of white bread.

59:30.700 --> 59:36.620
Then I would crush it in my fist like I was Thanos claiming a fucking reality gym.

59:36.620 --> 59:38.780
And then I put that in the microwave for like 10 seconds.

59:38.780 --> 59:42.060
I mean, I'm a pepperoni roll, but it's not, it's not, it's not.

59:42.060 --> 59:48.380
I really don't think you should be giving me more fuel because I will do that.

59:48.380 --> 59:49.740
No, this is great.

59:49.740 --> 59:50.700
Fucking chase your bliss.

59:50.700 --> 59:51.500
I'm serious, Nick.

59:51.500 --> 59:52.380
Eat your bread.

59:52.380 --> 59:53.020
Life's short.

59:53.020 --> 59:55.900
If it makes you happy, fucking eat your bread the weird way you eat it.

59:55.900 --> 59:57.260
Like a, like a.

59:57.260 --> 59:58.300
I believe in you, Nick.

59:59.260 --> 01:00:01.180
Sure, never give up.

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:03.340
Did that help?

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:03.900
Did that help?

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:04.860
Okay.

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:05.420
Yeah, sure.

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:07.980
Hi.

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.100
Hi, I'm Hannah.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.540
Sorry I didn't put my name in the email.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:16.380
Um, it's so a very important, uh, context for the question is that it's 2018 and that

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:20.780
will become very clear when you're an alien who found this in a like satellite, you never

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:21.100
know.

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:21.980
Like they might be.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:27.900
Um, and so my mom works for the news and she, uh, is like a new media developer and

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.220
like works for like internet news and whatever.

01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:35.420
She's like big and important, but, uh, so like in her work, she's very like new content,

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:35.900
whatever.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:41.180
And then in her home life, she in the year 2018 still uses AOL as a web browser.

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:48.060
And I honestly didn't know that was a thing that was still like you could physically do.

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:51.580
Like I thought that they had sort of, uh, I don't know.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:54.380
There's one person still at the other end of the computer.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.180
Like I'll check.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.220
And then they Google it.

01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:58.780
I got her.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.900
She's on the internet today and I've stood over while she's, you know, like in college

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:06.140
and whatever now and like trying to like load any webpage, but it's like, you know, Hey,

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.820
let's look at getting your health insurance.

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:12.620
And I'll be like leaning over her shoulder, waiting for like a full minute for a webpage

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:13.100
to load.

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.820
Cause it's on AOL in the year 2018.

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:21.260
And I've, I've tried to be like, Hey mom, Linda, uh, here's Google Chrome or any other

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:21.820
web browser.

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:22.300
Sure.

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:22.620
Okay.

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:28.780
So my question is how do I get my mom who is again, a professional like internet journalist

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:32.940
to stop using AOL as a web browser in the year 2018?

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.220
I mean, it's unfathomable.

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:34.860
It's unfathomable.

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:37.100
Can you just snap the disc over your leg?

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.820
Here's the thing though.

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:44.140
It's already like, there's no more disc.

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.180
It's already installed.

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.940
Like I could uninstall it from the computer.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:49.020
She's got an AOL dev kit from.

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:49.740
I guess.

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:51.180
All right.

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:52.540
I don't know how to get it off.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:57.420
Why don't you download Google Chrome, but then set the homepage to AOL.com.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:01.660
Cause then she'll still get all the great content that she craves.

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:08.860
Folks, speaking as someone who until, uh, 2012 was employed by AOL, fucking a lot of

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.620
people go to AOL.com.

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:15.500
It's a kind of a gross number of people definitely go to AOL.com as her home page.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.860
We're talking about the AOL web browser, which is a whole nother kettle of fish.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.420
But I'm saying AOL is a popular outlet.

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:23.260
They got a lot of great content.

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:24.220
That's the first thing.

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.580
Okay, maybe just tell her like AOL closed.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.020
Unplug the router.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.220
You should start by installing Netscape Navigator.

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.540
Yeah, you got a bill.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.540
You can't jump right into the deep end.

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:43.500
You're right, you're right, you're right.

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:45.180
Uh, yeah.

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:50.940
And it's still, if anyone's curious, it still looks the same as it did in 1999.

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:56.220
I'll tell you, sometimes when I do Google something, I get so many results back, it

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:56.860
scares me.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:03.180
I would love to just type in the keyword, new applesauce, and it will show me the one

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:03.580
website.

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.100
It's like, here's the newest applesauce.

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:06.140
Come get it.

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:11.340
I do, I do miss the days where there was a man named Jeeves who would bring me one thing.

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.540
Maybe it wasn't the one thing I wanted, but I wasn't overwhelmed.

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:14.940
Yeah.

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:19.340
Now Travis has to go to Fiverr and try to find somebody named Jeeves to Google shit

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:20.860
for him.

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:24.460
At AOL, you could join a chat room for people that like sports.

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.220
Can you fucking imagine?

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:32.460
Football, basketball, whatever.

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.580
Any sport.

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.140
They just join and talk about sports.

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.420
Maybe that's really what she's there for.

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:40.860
Maybe she just likes sports, but she doesn't want to get too specific about it.

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:41.420
So she's gotta be on the sports chat room.

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:42.460
It's entirely possible.

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:44.940
I'm gonna give the same answer to the bread monster.

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:47.420
Just let her chase her place.

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:49.740
It sounds cool if she's having it.

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:50.700
Seems like she's having it.

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:54.540
Honestly, can I ask everybody in the room who's been having a good chuckle?

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:56.140
Take a beep.

01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:59.500
Think about your experience with the internet.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.700
And if you couldn't put that fucking genie back in the bottle, would you not?

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:06.780
If you could un-internet yourself, you probably would right now.

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:10.540
Let's let her live like Charlie Bucket.

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:15.260
Have one more dream before we wake her up and tell her all the golden tickets are gone.

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:16.540
Eh?

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:17.420
Does that help?

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.220
Yeah, it helps a ton.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:18.700
Thank you so much.

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:19.020
Thank you.

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:19.660
My pleasure.

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:20.300
Let's kick.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:20.860
And hello.

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:22.220
Hi.

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.740
Hi, who's you?

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:24.380
I am Eric.

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:26.060
Hello, Eric.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:27.100
You's Eric.

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:33.340
So I was in a real big hurry right out of work, and I needed to get to the mechanic

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:34.700
who had my car.

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:36.620
And the city-

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:38.220
You getting some fucking NOS?

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:39.280
Yeah.

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.100
It was an upgrade.

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:46.620
No, I needed to get there quick, and the city had just got these electric scooters that,

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:53.260
you know, and I thought this would be a real cool way to finish, or like to start my evening.

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:55.260
Thought no one ever.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.300
There's something new.

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.620
I ate it.

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:03.100
Yeah.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:03.900
You ate the scooter?

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:04.940
You ate the whole scooter?

01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:07.020
You did it so bad.

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:07.740
That's inadvisable.

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.340
They tell you that right in the app.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:12.620
They tell you that right in the app to not eat it.

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.220
I know it looks delicious, but please.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:15.820
It's called a lime.

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:19.020
All right, listen.

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:21.580
It's different things in different cities, but Travis is right.

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.500
It's called a lime in some cities.

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.140
There was a great joke that would have played in a city.

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:28.780
In some cities, it's called a bird, which you could stretch.

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:29.100
Sorry.

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:29.740
Okay.

01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:32.220
So you, oh, you crashed.

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:34.380
Yeah, I crashed the scooter.

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:34.860
Oh, no.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.260
Was the scooter okay?

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:39.100
The scooter was fine.

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:39.900
Oh.

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.860
I had gotten probably 11 feet.

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:45.580
Holy shit.

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:49.420
Now, I need to hear a lot more about the question.

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:52.460
I do want to say it's quite a relief that we're going to have one tonight

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.540
where we're not just affirming your life choices.

01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:57.660
I want to hear more about the big spill.

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:01.580
Take it into slow mode for us.

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.460
How does it feel?

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.780
This is radio AFV for me.

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.100
I am loving it.

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:09.580
Well.

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.700
You're okay, though, right?

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:11.020
Yeah.

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:12.220
Okay, then I'm loving it.

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:12.380
Yeah.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:20.860
There is no way that someone at my work did not see it.

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:21.100
Yeah.

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:21.980
Okay.

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:25.900
Was it a cool fall where you like fell and landed like...

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.380
On your side on like a sexy pose?

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:31.900
Maybe that's what it looked like.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:34.460
What did it feel like?

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:34.780
Yeah.

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:40.140
Yeah, so I was in a hurry, so I had gone as quickly as I could,

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:41.180
as quickly as I could.

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.500
And so I...

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.780
The scooter stopped and I did not.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:47.740
Right.

01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:48.380
Sure.

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:52.060
And I hit in like an attempted sexy slide

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:59.580
and kind of skid across the pavement and lost my pants and...

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:11.260
Fuck, yes!

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:12.300
In a cool way?

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:15.740
Kind of a sexy...

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:19.420
There's still a benefit, a shadow of a chance.

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.020
It was still a cool crash.

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.780
It took all my pants.

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:25.020
Yeah.

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:26.540
Claimed your pants.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.620
It took all my pants.

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:29.100
Yeah.

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.260
The street just a mouth opened up.

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.660
Mine now!

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:36.540
Your pants belong to the city.

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:42.140
I would sell one of my children into maritime service to watch this happen.

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:49.180
So, but it sounds like some of your co-workers did enjoy the show.

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:55.260
I can't see a way that someone didn't see it.

01:07:55.260 --> 01:08:00.540
So you're wondering if we have a job for you in the My Brother, My Brother and Me corporate ladder?

01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:03.340
Yeah, part of it.

01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:04.380
What are your qualifications?

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.020
Because I know riding a scooter good is not one of them.

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:11.020
You are okay though, right?

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.140
I'm good, yeah.

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:12.860
Okay, cool.

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:15.660
How are your pants?

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:15.980
Stop.

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.300
What is your question?

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.460
Because I can't uncrash that scooter for you.

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:26.780
How do I sort through my co-workers and find out who saw?

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:33.660
I would like to see if any of them have burst blood vessels from laughing.

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:40.460
There, there was peepus.

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:49.420
They're like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:50.540
wait, wait.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:54.780
So when you say took all your pants.

01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:59.500
Yeah, yeah, no, all of the pants that I had.

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.300
Okay, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:06.460
Do you remember when I said the thing about how there's still a shadow of a chance that

01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:07.420
it was a cool crash?

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:13.580
Listen, I'm not, I'm not judging you.

01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.260
This question's been going for a while.

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:17.740
You really made us wait for that big reveal.

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:20.940
But you didn't make your co-workers wait, which is great.

01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.940
Well, huh?

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:24.140
Maybe you need a sketch artist.

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.660
Like, have you seen this peepus?

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:28.780
That ain't going to do it.

01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:34.220
Hey, have you considered just trying to make eye contact with your co-workers one at a

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:34.780
time?

01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:37.020
That seems foolproof.

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:39.500
So where do you work now?

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:45.740
How long were you on the ground before you got up?

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:46.780
Different stage.

01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:49.820
Different state or just a different city or what?

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.060
This is a cool story.

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:57.900
You're going to fucking know who saw.

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.700
In your heart, you know.

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:08.140
What you need is a way of making it just like foolproof where if somebody can't meet your

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:15.100
gaze, you just like nod at them in a way to say like, you saw it and then they'll nod

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.220
back and then you'll know.

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:18.060
Maybe you need like them to sign a...

01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:22.380
This is above HR's head is the problem.

01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:29.900
You must quit this job.

01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:32.220
There's no jokes.

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:35.500
Where jokes left, jokes left the room.

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.340
Because quit would imply that you went back to turn in some paperwork or something.

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:41.740
You can't go back anymore.

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:42.300
I got it.

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:43.660
I got it.

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:44.940
I got it.

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:45.660
I got it.

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:48.380
You're going to have to do this again inside the office.

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:52.700
No, listen, this accomplishes two things.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:54.620
One, whoever...

01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:58.140
There's going to be two tiers of laughter at this point.

01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:00.780
People laughing very hard and then people laughing kind of hard.

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.180
The people on that lower tier definitely saw it the first time.

01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:09.580
The other benefit is now you will know that everyone has seen it and you don't have to

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:10.080
swear.

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:12.540
That's how you start to rebuild.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.100
Does that help?

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:15.580
Yeah.

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:15.980
Thank you.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:16.460
Excellent.

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:17.180
Glad we can help.

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:18.700
Last one.

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:18.940
All right.

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:19.260
Yeah.

01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:19.740
Colin.

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:23.660
Hello, Colin.

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:24.460
Yes, Colin.

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:25.100
Hi, Colin.

01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:27.820
So what happened?

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:29.900
We were today at the Denver Zoo.

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:30.620
Hell yeah.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.340
Which was great.

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:32.140
How is it?

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:33.740
It was super awesome.

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:34.300
Cool.

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:34.940
I'd never been.

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.780
Anyway, lots of great animals.

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.820
So it's the goal.

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:42.060
Like that's what they go for there.

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:42.700
They got there.

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:46.460
So we were in the tropical exhibit with all the snakes.

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:49.340
And when we came outside, there's all the strollers they had parked there because you

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.300
can have the strollers inside.

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:52.700
Of the snake exhibit.

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:54.460
I like that policy a lot.

01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:55.820
Well, no, the babies were inside.

01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:57.020
Just can't have the strollers.

01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:57.980
Oh, OK.

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:00.140
So there's empty strollers just lined up there.

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:06.140
So we walk out and the stroller nearest the door, I see that there is a squirrel tail protruding

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:09.100
from the bag of this stroller.

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.540
And I say, oh, neat.

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:11.340
A squirrel, whatever.

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:15.660
And then moments later, the squirrel leaps out and has in its mouth a Ziploc baggy with

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.980
half what I think was a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:18.460
Nice.

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:21.420
That's a dream if you're a squirrel.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:22.220
Sure, they love that.

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.820
The squirrel was having a great time.

01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.460
So and then I was sort of watching the squirrel like, oh, is he going to get in?

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:29.260
And my first instinct was, should I help the squirrel open the bag?

01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:33.100
That didn't last very long, but that was sort of the first thought.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:33.900
Sure.

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:39.020
But then the second thought was, should we wait and tell the people that own the stroller?

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:44.220
And I guess this is the question, is there an etiquette to if you see a squirrel in like

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:50.380
somebody's baby bag, are you obligated to like leave a note or like tell them there

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:53.740
was a rodent in your baby bag you have to burn?

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:55.420
What do you do?

01:12:55.420 --> 01:13:00.540
Yeah, my immediate gut check is that you have to have that conversation and make sure you

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.780
do it while I'm standing within earshot.

01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:05.740
Because holy shit, I want to hear what that sounds like, bud.

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:10.140
I will tell you right now, I have a two-year-old who I love very much.

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:16.460
But if I walked out and found, I guess, a note on her stroller that said, I saw a squirrel

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:20.460
in your bag, I wouldn't know what to do with that information.

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:22.700
I guess throw the bag away.

01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:27.500
Flip side, if I was going back to the car and my son was screaming for his peanut butter

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:31.980
jelly sandwich, I reached down there and some fucking furry rapscallion has taken it away.

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:33.900
I'm going to lose my fucking gourd.

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:35.820
So yes, I would like a heads up.

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:39.100
Well, and so what we ended up doing was sort of lurking in the area.

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:42.460
And as people with babies would walk by, we'd sort of watch and see if they were going to

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:43.660
walk towards the stroller.

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.580
Oh, God, that's a good look, bud.

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.820
So to my credit, I was there with my girlfriend.

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:53.660
So I at least sort of had that feminine buffer.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:54.620
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.580
But we did realize quickly.

01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:59.580
More of like a couple shopping than like a kidnapper.

01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:04.380
All right, but we we did realize pretty not quickly enough, but eventually that we can't

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:06.620
just be the people hanging out by the strollers.

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:07.180
Right, right.

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:09.900
Yeah, we did go and look at the lions.

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:12.060
Hey, hey, Colin, tell me true.

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:18.460
When you went outside and you looked at the strollers and you saw a squirrel tail poking

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:21.580
out of one of them out of the bag, the storage bag in the back.

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:24.540
Did you have even for a little bit?

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:26.300
And don't be afraid if the answer is yes.

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:29.980
Did you have the thought of somebody's trying to steal squirrels from the zoo?

01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:36.620
At the time, I was very in tune with the animals.

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:39.100
So it was like, I want this squirrel to succeed.

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:40.140
Yeah, I like that.

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.020
Uh, shit.

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:46.940
I mean, I'm glad that you didn't chase the scroll away because like you can't go to a

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.820
parent and say, hey, no big deal.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:53.740
A squirrel ate that a little bit, but it should be fine.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:54.780
I saved most of it.

01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:57.100
I saved most of it, it should be fine to give to your child.

01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.020
A squirrel only ate a little bit.

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:02.140
Well, part of what I wanted to hang around for just to see if the squirrel would hang

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:03.820
around so I could see if it would get into the bag.

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.740
I don't know if the squirrel got the sandwich.

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:06.620
Wait, hold on, Colin.

01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:07.740
Are you afraid it gave up?

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:09.420
I don't know.

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:11.980
I don't know how trepidatious that squirrel was.

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:15.740
That's the closest that squirrel has ever been to pure happiness.

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:16.620
It's not going to quit.

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:20.140
I guarantee you, let me give you at least that bit of solace.

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.580
The squirrel got the sandwich, no question.

01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:29.340
Even if it had to throw it out of a tree a bunch until the bag exploded, it got it.

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:30.380
It got the sandwich.

01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:33.900
And his squirrel friends are looking at him like, just fucking give it up, Derek.

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:34.380
Damn.

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:41.740
Um, hey, I just decided, do not approach these parents.

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:43.340
There you go.

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:43.980
Thank you, Colin.

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:47.100
If I look for a sandwich and it's not there, I'll be like, oh, what an inconvenience.

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:50.860
If a stranger approaches me at the zoo while I'm with my kid and says, a squirrel got your

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:58.940
bag, I'm going to run away quite fast and dream about it for the rest of my life.

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:05.260
It sounds like you're covering up for a much worse thing you did, honestly.

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:06.780
That's how it sounds.

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:07.740
Does that help, Colin?

01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:08.620
That helps very much.

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:09.020
Thank you.

01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:09.980
It comes a little late.

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:13.740
I imagine this helped, but next time.

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:15.020
I know I did the right thing.

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:15.420
Good.

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:16.300
Thank you.

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:16.620
All right.

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:17.980
Can we bring the house lights back down?

01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:19.660
We're going to watch out for those house lights out.

01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:24.300
Folks, thank you so much for having us here in this beautiful city.

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.580
You've been so amazing.

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:34.540
Wanted to mention it's that giving time of year, and we ask every year that you are kind

01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:38.620
enough to support our hometown of Huntington, West Virginia in helping to give the families

01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:43.180
there a little bit nicer holiday season here in these candle nights.

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:46.780
It is more desirable than normal to give to charity.

01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:53.740
So we have asked that you go to MBMBAMangels.com and claim some of the items there, or you can

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:58.140
just kick in some money to help give some folks a nice holiday season.

01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:59.180
So please do that.

01:16:59.180 --> 01:16:59.500
Thank you.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.460
If you would be so kind.

01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:06.460
Also, we hope that you've already grabbed them because we don't know how many are left,

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:09.500
but there are some really amazing posters.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.660
Yeah, Anusha Syed did those, and they are great.

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.500
They're fucking so good.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:14.460
Incredible.

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:20.860
Overall, I also want to say we have a graphic novel series based on our podcast, The Adventure

01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:21.180
Zone.

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:24.540
Thank you.

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:30.220
You can go to TheAdventureZoneComic.com and pre-order book two, or order book one if you

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:32.300
haven't gotten it yet, TheAdventureZoneComic.com.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:35.340
Yes, I want to thank the Well Theater.

01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:38.940
It's so big, first of all, which is wild.

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.220
And nice.

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:45.100
It's very, very nice, but we walked out here for sound check and my stomach raised up into

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.500
my lungs out of fear, but you all have been great.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.460
So thank you for that.

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:56.060
Thank you to our daddy for coming with us on tour and introducing us.

01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:02.700
Thank you to Paul for all the help.

01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:04.140
We could not do this without Paul.

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:09.660
Thank you to our families who came with us, and they're incredibly supportive and wonderful.

01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:12.060
Especially with our incredible opening act.

01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:14.540
Yes, thank you to Sawbones.

01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:15.900
They're going places.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.980
Don't forget to grab the Sawbones book.

01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:19.100
Griffin, I'm ready.

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.020
Final Yahoo is sent in by Morgan Davey.

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:23.020
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:29.340
It's by an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call Priebus.

01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:30.540
Okay.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.180
That's a weird name when you know what the question is.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.700
Thank you for your bravery, Priebus, because Priebus asks,

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:39.260
Can I vape and still be a Republican?

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:44.380
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:45.420
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:46.460
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:47.500
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:19:07.500
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.220
Come back to WKEP at night.

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:24.700
Up next, looks like we've got a PSA from local forest ranger Duck Newton.

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:25.900
Do I start now or?

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:27.100
Yeah, lean in, Duck.

01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:27.660
Yeah, sorry.

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:31.340
Okay, I wanted to address the unfortunate situation that...

01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:34.220
Okay, listen.

01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:39.180
Two people, good people that I and a lot of y'all have known our whole lives are dead.

01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:40.060
Torn to shreds by-

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:44.300
A savage, bloodthirsty beast that defies human comprehension.

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:47.020
If you'd like to know more, stop by the Kryptonomica.

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:48.860
Kepler's Premier Museum of the Macabre.

01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:49.900
Just online with-

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:50.460
Come on.

01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:53.260
We just wanted to warn y'all to beg you.

01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:55.660
If you see one of those things out in the forest, don't fight.

01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:57.420
Don't scream.

01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:57.660
Run.

01:19:58.220 --> 01:19:59.900
Run as far as you can.

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:01.020
Duck, it's almost midnight.

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:01.820
Listen, folks.

01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:06.300
If you see anything, please go to TheLamplighter.org and let us know.

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:08.780
And get behind a locked door tonight.

01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:09.980
Anything else we need to-

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:11.420
Oh, they're leaving.

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:18.460
Okay, well, that's TheLamplighter.org and stay safe out there, Kepler.
