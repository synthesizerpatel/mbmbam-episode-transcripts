00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:45.920 --> 01:02.000
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for joining us today for a very special

01:02.560 --> 01:10.000
My Brother, My Brother, and Me, episode 250. A very important episode in the lifetime of any

01:10.000 --> 01:15.840
podcast, and here we are, having our midlife crisis. I'm your youngest, babiest brother, Griffin

01:15.840 --> 01:22.080
McElroy, joining me my two dear brothers. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I didn't know

01:22.080 --> 01:32.400
we were doing something. And singing for us is Babs herself, Barbra Streisand. We managed,

01:32.400 --> 01:36.320
we called up Babs. I was like, I need you, and she's like, what is it, podcast episode 250?

01:36.320 --> 01:42.480
And I was like, yep, and she's like, the third one this week. Standard rates, free, here I come.

01:42.480 --> 01:49.520
Making my entrance again with my you. Here come the Babs. Justin's around here somewhere.

01:50.800 --> 02:00.080
Hey guys, what a pleasure it is to be on this special episode of My Brother, My Brother,

02:00.080 --> 02:11.760
My Brother, Me. My fault, I feel. I thought you want what I want. I'm sorry, my dear.

02:14.080 --> 02:24.800
But where are the clowns? Big finish. Send in the clowns. Did we get clowns? Don't bother. Oh.

02:24.800 --> 02:37.120
Okay. They are here. I love that we're making a big deal out of episode 250. Maybe

02:38.320 --> 02:43.520
next year. I love they're making such a big deal out of episode 250 when we have completely fucking

02:43.520 --> 02:52.960
dropped the ball on so many other celebrations. April 11th, 2015 marked the five-year anniversary

02:52.960 --> 02:58.160
of My Brother, My Brother, Me. Totally slept on it. We just missed it. Five years of goofs,

02:59.440 --> 03:06.400
and we just, I mean, we whiffed it. No, I remembered. I spent the day staring into a mirror

03:07.040 --> 03:12.880
and just drinking whiskey as I glared upon what five years of the weight of this show had done

03:12.880 --> 03:20.240
to my body. What are we talking about? Oh, it's bad. It's like, you eat a lot of fried chicken wings,

03:20.240 --> 03:24.320
and I think that that maybe has a more detrimental effect than our-

03:24.320 --> 03:32.160
When I started this show five years ago, I was a beautiful young man. Some people said

03:32.880 --> 03:41.360
God-like features. But like the traditional sort of vision of God as an old bearded man.

03:41.360 --> 03:44.080
Yeah, but like beautiful in that way where you look at him and be like,

03:44.080 --> 03:48.560
that's a beautiful young old God. Sort of like how John Lithgow is beautiful.

03:48.560 --> 03:53.920
Yeah, but now I'm more like John Lovitz. Beautiful, but like in a different way.

03:53.920 --> 03:58.960
I'd like to make a point, by the way, that had we done a fifth anniversary observation,

03:58.960 --> 04:06.320
this is the entirety of what it would have been. Five years is 260 weeks. In that five-year period,

04:06.320 --> 04:11.200
we produced 247 episodes of My Brother, My Brother, Me, and the Vice Show for the Maldonera.

04:11.200 --> 04:19.440
That is a miss of 13. That is 13 missed weeks. I think for five years, that's pretty good.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.560
That's pretty fucking good.

04:22.240 --> 04:26.320
This is my challenge to you, the listener. Find another podcast with that hit rate,

04:26.880 --> 04:30.000
and I'll be impressed.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.840
We're the Cal Ripken of podcasts.

04:33.840 --> 04:38.160
If Cal Ripken can miss one every once in a while, we're the Cal Ripken of podcasts.

04:38.160 --> 04:45.440
Do we miss any other important celebrations? Obviously, it's Thorwatch 3 with Avengers 2

04:45.440 --> 04:48.800
in theaters right now, but we just didn't have time to do that, I guess.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.040
Didn't do that.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.920
Episode 69, I feel like we didn't really make a big deal out of.

04:56.640 --> 05:01.120
Before I forget, Teresa and I went and saw Avengers 2 at 8 30 in the morning,

05:01.120 --> 05:05.120
and we walked into the lobby of the movie theater. Do you know who else sees movies

05:05.120 --> 05:08.480
at 8 30 in the morning? Donald Faison.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.280
That's a great get.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.680
Did you hit him up?

05:13.680 --> 05:17.280
I didn't. I wanted to so bad, but he was mid-conversation with someone,

05:17.280 --> 05:20.720
and I wanted to be cool. I wanted Donald Faison to think I was cool.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.000
Man, I wish.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.200
A lot of missed observations, a lot of missed celebrations. We're going to circle back to

05:27.200 --> 05:33.920
some of them throughout the show as they come to us. We're not about self-adulation. I don't

05:33.920 --> 05:38.640
think that's a crime. Well, I self-adulated yesterday. Wait, what are you talking about?

05:39.600 --> 05:41.200
Masturbating a penis.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.760
Five years more mature, ladies and gentlemen.

05:43.760 --> 05:48.880
Griffin is providing a new service for our listeners that have trouble detecting dick jokes.

05:48.880 --> 05:54.160
He's actually, to mark our fifth anniversary, he's actually providing a new service that is

05:54.160 --> 05:59.280
not optional, that is required, where he points out dick jokes as we perform them and explains

05:59.280 --> 06:01.920
them. It's boner captioning.

06:01.920 --> 06:06.720
I am wondering if it's appropriate to moan slash groan in pleasure.

06:10.240 --> 06:13.600
Moan slash groan in pleasure.

06:13.600 --> 06:18.880
I just experienced ear shrinkage. Is that weird? My ears just sort of shrank and recoiled.

06:18.880 --> 06:23.920
Griffin is referring to the way a penis will sometimes shrink and recoil.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.720
As highlighted in the hilarious Seinfeld episode.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.520
No, Justin, I was actually talking about my ears.

06:29.520 --> 06:43.200
Is it appropriate to moan slash groan in pleasure when receiving a massage from a professional

06:43.200 --> 06:46.400
massage therapist in a paid setting?

06:46.400 --> 06:48.560
Nobody's listening to the show anymore. If you keep doing this,

06:48.560 --> 06:50.880
we're going to lose every listener that we've ever had.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.240
Hurry through it. Say the rest of it.

06:52.240 --> 06:56.720
Okay, okay. I asked this because I was receiving a massage from my boyfriend,

06:56.720 --> 07:00.560
a dedicated fan of the Bim Bam, and I asked him to buy me a real massage.

07:00.560 --> 07:04.320
Then I wondered if this sort of moaning groaning you do when getting a massage

07:04.320 --> 07:08.320
from a loved one is appropriate in a formal setting. Advice is appreciated

07:08.320 --> 07:12.480
and needed, and that's from Pondering in Portland. This is a fucking great question.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.560
This is the best question. Yeah, it's a real good one.

07:14.560 --> 07:18.000
You know, because my immediate reaction was like, oh, no, no, no.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.400
But then I think, like, what if it's like the massage therapist expects you to do it?

07:22.400 --> 07:24.640
And if you don't do it, they're like, am I losing it?

07:24.640 --> 07:27.840
Do I lose my tubs? I used to be able to rub.

07:27.840 --> 07:31.600
But then again, what if you do too much? And then the masseuse is like,

07:31.600 --> 07:35.040
I'll rub what she's rubbing or something like that.

07:36.480 --> 07:43.920
I actually had a massage experience last weekend for Sydney's birthday.

07:43.920 --> 07:49.040
We went to the beautiful Glade Springs Resort in Beckley, West Virginia,

07:49.040 --> 07:55.040
and we got a couple's massage. And before the our. OK, first off,

07:55.040 --> 07:56.640
let me ask you guys this. This is not a joke.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.440
None of this is a joke, but like this is not particularly funny.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.680
I'm just curious. There was a man and a woman.

08:02.320 --> 08:06.160
When I saw the two of them, I was absolutely horrified.

08:06.160 --> 08:10.800
We were going to be asked to choose. There is that is the Kobayashi Maru of marriage.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.080
And there's no way I would have got it. It's the Kobayashi Maru of massages.

08:14.080 --> 08:19.200
Whenever whenever you pick a like a preference at a new massage place,

08:19.200 --> 08:22.080
like what do you want, dudes or women? And it's like,

08:22.080 --> 08:24.160
well, there's no good answer to this, is there?

08:24.160 --> 08:26.880
Because if I pick women, it's like women.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.960
But actually, I got asked the same thing.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.880
The only time I've ever had a prostate exam.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.560
That's not a no. That's absolutely true.

08:34.560 --> 08:36.240
And I did not know how to answer.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.640
They asked if I'd rather have a male or a female doctor.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.200
It's literally we just not do it.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.440
It's either women or men. Like, it doesn't matter.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.160
I guess that's true. It is a gender neutral.

08:48.160 --> 08:52.480
Like it is the most beautiful, softest one.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.560
Whichever one you pick is like, because I want it.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.760
Who do you have? Who is the slipperiest?

09:01.760 --> 09:04.320
Bring me a spectrum and I shall choose.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.600
If Earth is ever invaded by pansexual, pangender aliens,

09:07.600 --> 09:08.800
I hope we do the right thing.

09:08.800 --> 09:12.080
And job one, before we ask about their technology

09:12.080 --> 09:13.680
or their medical advances,

09:13.680 --> 09:15.840
like we just put them to work doing massages.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.840
Because that is, there is a no lose pick right there.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.720
Put your weird sucker fins right on my back.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.600
And this is good. I excrete a jelly through my gills

09:26.480 --> 09:29.520
that it's like icy hot. You're going to love it.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.320
I'm a very, very slippery alien.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.800
Also, I exude the smell of lavender, so it's perfect.

09:34.800 --> 09:38.640
Perfect. No, but when they, in the massage,

09:38.640 --> 09:40.640
right before they leave the room,

09:41.360 --> 09:44.400
they say, and this is a direct fucking quote.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.560
Speaking of like impossible scenarios,

09:46.560 --> 09:49.680
they say undress to your comfort level.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.840
And then get out of the blanket.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.800
And then it's like, oh, you left your boxers on? Pervert.

09:55.440 --> 09:56.240
Exactly.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.760
You want to be a messy underwear boy, huh? Okay.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.920
Like, do you want me to be honest?

10:01.920 --> 10:03.440
Because you don't need to leave the room

10:03.440 --> 10:05.040
for me to address to my comfort level.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.160
I'll just hop on up on that table.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.000
Yeah. Let me just get up on this table.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.920
If I had, if I could reach a comfort level

10:11.920 --> 10:14.720
with fewer articles of clothing before I left the hotel room,

10:14.720 --> 10:17.360
I would have done just that. This is my comfort level.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.520
I'm here. I'm living in it.

10:19.520 --> 10:20.880
We're talking about moaning and grinning.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.720
It's hard to say anything in that situation

10:22.720 --> 10:25.840
without feeling like a total, total nasty boy.

10:26.480 --> 10:29.440
Like a little softer. That's, it sounds like,

10:30.960 --> 10:32.800
where do you want me to rub? Where does it hurt?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.960
Uh, my upper thigh.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.040
Like it does. I just started, I started running.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.720
My thighs hurt a lot, but I can't be like,

10:38.720 --> 10:40.400
I need you to pay special attention

10:40.400 --> 10:43.120
to my bottom of my bathing suit reaching zone.

10:44.320 --> 10:47.200
They asked him, like, if I had any problem areas.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.720
They have to ask for attention.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.680
Like, there's no, where, there's not a right,

10:51.680 --> 10:55.520
I mean, what answer could I give there?

10:55.520 --> 10:56.560
My forehead.

10:56.560 --> 10:56.880
My forehead?

10:56.880 --> 10:57.680
There's nothing, nothing.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.040
My earlobes?

10:59.040 --> 11:00.160
No, that's bad.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.480
Rub my ear, rub them lobes.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.520
But yeah, go ahead and moan, moan away.

11:05.520 --> 11:06.320
Go to town.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.360
No, wait, what?

11:07.360 --> 11:08.560
No, we didn't answer the question.

11:08.560 --> 11:09.920
No, I wouldn't moan.

11:09.920 --> 11:10.720
Yeah, moan.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.040
I wouldn't moan, I don't think.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.440
But I, this is one of the scenarios, Justin,

11:15.440 --> 11:17.840
where I'm gonna say that like, no matter what you do,

11:17.840 --> 11:20.880
because you're concerned about appearing weird and creepy,

11:20.880 --> 11:22.720
that you will not be the creepiest person

11:22.720 --> 11:24.720
who's ever come into this establishment.

11:24.720 --> 11:27.680
So I say go to town because for every one of you,

11:27.680 --> 11:29.520
there are a hundred people who are just like,

11:29.520 --> 11:30.720
there are a hundred people who are just like,

11:30.720 --> 11:31.520
I'm here for me.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.600
You know that there are people who,

11:33.600 --> 11:35.920
when told undress to their comfort level,

11:35.920 --> 11:38.160
literally just reached out at lightning speed

11:38.160 --> 11:39.520
and pulled their dick out of the hole

11:39.520 --> 11:40.720
in the front of their pants.

11:40.720 --> 11:44.560
Like, okay, how about I undress to your comfort level

11:44.560 --> 11:46.320
and see who blanches first?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.080
I need to know what your,

11:48.720 --> 11:50.960
we may be getting too intimate now as brothers,

11:50.960 --> 11:51.920
but I do wanna know,

11:51.920 --> 11:53.920
I wanna know what your comfort level was

11:53.920 --> 11:54.960
in that situation with your wife and the couples.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.680
Well, fucking great news, Griffin.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.560
I was wearing some me undies boxers,

12:00.560 --> 12:03.600
so I felt very confident that the,

12:04.800 --> 12:08.480
because of the relaxed fit of my me undies boxers,

12:08.480 --> 12:10.480
that they would be able to massage around them.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.440
So my comfort level was my me undies boxers

12:13.440 --> 12:15.280
and nothing else.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.880
Okay, I thought you were gonna be like,

12:16.880 --> 12:20.960
I need you to massage around my Tybee Island

12:20.960 --> 12:22.080
parrot head t-shirt.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.600
No, the cargo shorts will remain on.

12:27.600 --> 12:31.440
Anywhere you see cargo shorts, I am fine there.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.320
No soreness in the cargo short reach.

12:34.320 --> 12:39.120
Please rub around the 3DS in the pocket of my cargo shorts.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.920
Explore around my Nintendo 3DS,

12:41.920 --> 12:45.440
but I need it there because I am street passing

12:45.440 --> 12:46.720
with a 12 year old.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.200
How about a Yahoo answer?

12:49.200 --> 12:49.700
Hit me.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.040
This Yahoo answer was sent in by level 9,000.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.800
Yeah, Drew Druid, Drew Davenport.

12:54.800 --> 12:55.280
Thank you, Drew.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.360
It's by a Yahoo answers user, Iceman,

12:57.360 --> 12:57.860
who asks,

12:58.720 --> 12:59.760
Iceman.

12:59.760 --> 13:00.260
Sweet.

13:01.120 --> 13:04.640
Is someone with the personality of Jackie Chan

13:04.640 --> 13:06.560
the perfect man for a woman?

13:07.760 --> 13:08.260
Wait.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.800
I've always wondered about that.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.720
I don't personally know him,

13:12.720 --> 13:16.000
but he seems humble, generous, unselfish, and kind.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.640
What do you think is someone like him

13:18.640 --> 13:20.000
irresistible to women?

13:20.880 --> 13:22.480
Update, is he your type of guy

13:22.480 --> 13:25.120
or do you need a man who's more aggressive and combative?

13:25.120 --> 13:25.600
Wait, hold on.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.000
Do you think someone with the personality of Jackie Chan

13:28.000 --> 13:29.040
the perfect man for a woman?

13:29.040 --> 13:30.560
I want to start with the update.

13:30.560 --> 13:34.320
That person put that fucking crazy ass question

13:34.320 --> 13:35.520
in the Yahoo answers,

13:35.520 --> 13:36.480
then went about their day,

13:36.480 --> 13:37.280
and then they were like,

13:37.280 --> 13:40.000
oh, wait, yeah, I can't believe I didn't say.

13:40.000 --> 13:40.800
Oh, shit.

13:40.800 --> 13:41.440
One other thing.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.440
I think Jackie Chan is the perfect man for a woman,

13:45.440 --> 13:47.920
a man, whatever, because yes.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.360
He's good for what ails you.

13:49.360 --> 13:50.240
He's good for what ails you

13:50.240 --> 13:52.640
no matter what you are in the mood for.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.080
Jackie Chan has got it.

13:54.080 --> 13:54.480
What do you need?

13:54.480 --> 13:56.000
Do you need a bodyguard?

13:56.000 --> 13:56.720
You need a bodyguard?

13:56.720 --> 14:00.480
Sure, if that is your romantic ideal,

14:00.480 --> 14:02.320
then fine, he can be that for you.

14:02.320 --> 14:06.000
Do you need stunts in your life?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.120
In your life, do you need somebody

14:07.120 --> 14:09.680
to jump off of a ramp into a helicopter?

14:09.680 --> 14:11.760
Because he'll do it, and he'll do it for real.

14:11.760 --> 14:16.160
What if I needed a kind of bumbling tutor for my kids,

14:16.160 --> 14:19.280
right, but then somebody tried to kidnap my children

14:20.000 --> 14:22.880
from our home one evening while I was, say, at the opera.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.720
Do I need Jackie Chan for that?

14:24.720 --> 14:29.200
I possess an extraordinarily technologically advanced tuxedo,

14:29.200 --> 14:31.280
and I need a man to wear it.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.040
Who's gonna wear my space tech tuxedo?

14:33.760 --> 14:36.480
Hey, it's me, Owen Wilson.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.680
I'm looking for a friend.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.000
See if you got any ideas.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.480
I think I can help you out with that, Vince Vaughn.

14:42.480 --> 14:43.440
No, not quite.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.560
Can I hear that Owen Wilson again one more time?

14:46.560 --> 14:47.060
Yeah.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.760
I'm looking for a friend.

14:49.760 --> 14:53.280
And this is Owen Wilson right after waking up.

14:54.640 --> 14:55.760
No, he's always a little lost.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.400
I'm just looking for somebody to help me

14:58.400 --> 14:59.920
just be my friend, you know?

15:00.640 --> 15:01.600
You're getting closer.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.480
I got a mouth shave to help get me a little bit closer.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.400
Hold your nose.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.280
See if that helps.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.800
I want to talk about life stunts.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.160
Okay.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.240
Griffin mentioned this idea of life stunts,

15:12.240 --> 15:13.920
and it really resonated with me.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.720
As in, stunts are things that happen in movies

15:16.720 --> 15:19.360
to make it look like something dangerous is happening, correct?

15:19.360 --> 15:19.840
Yeah.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.400
And nobody gets hurt, ideally.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.600
Well, no, that's my favorite part of every Jackie Chan movie.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.160
Is that reel at the end where he has stunt bloopers?

15:28.160 --> 15:28.960
You saved that.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.200
You saved the snuff for the ending.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.480
Here's all the parts where Jackie Chan died

15:34.480 --> 15:36.480
and was replacing the new Jackie Chan.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.760
And also, he got hit in the balls 17 times during filming.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.200
Like 17 different times.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.120
And every time that, you got to feel bad

15:43.120 --> 15:45.360
for that fight coordinator guy who's just like in it.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.600
It's just like, oh, I got in Shanghai Noon 6?

15:47.600 --> 15:48.160
Awesome.

15:48.160 --> 15:48.880
This is going to be great.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.080
It's going to be so good for my career.

15:50.080 --> 15:50.960
No, actually, bad news.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.600
You accidentally kicked Jackie Chan in the right nut,

15:53.600 --> 15:55.360
and you'll never work in this town again.

15:55.360 --> 15:55.840
Yeah.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.120
And now you're blackballed.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.040
Oh, God.

15:59.040 --> 15:59.840
Oh, God.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.840
Jackie Chan is the perfect man for any woman

16:01.840 --> 16:06.080
unless she does not want a man who is just permanently sterile.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.160
Like beyond sterile.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.680
Permanently purple down there.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.040
Just beat to hell.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.720
You can't even clone Jackie Chan.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.680
That's how sterile this cat is from all the ball shots.

16:15.680 --> 16:16.480
Life stunts.

16:17.280 --> 16:17.920
What?

16:17.920 --> 16:21.360
Why don't we have more parts of your life

16:21.360 --> 16:24.080
that incorporate stunts that are preplanned

16:24.080 --> 16:25.120
that you know you're going to do

16:26.480 --> 16:29.440
and just have like more stunts in your life?

16:29.440 --> 16:32.560
Do you know where that would be a huge benefit, Justin?

16:33.120 --> 16:34.560
Imagine like you've just realized-

16:34.560 --> 16:36.560
Viral wedding proposal videos.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.200
Yes.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.680
You've just realized your fly is down, right?

16:39.680 --> 16:41.360
And you're like, oh, I need a distraction.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.360
You look over at Jackie Chan, you nod.

16:43.360 --> 16:47.840
He pretends to like fall through like an awning,

16:47.840 --> 16:48.480
you know what I mean?

16:48.480 --> 16:50.080
And land and pop back up and all that

16:50.080 --> 16:52.240
while you're zipping up your fly and no one notices.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.600
That might be a little elaborate.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.720
It's a little elaborate.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.280
I think I would just say like, please meet Jackie Chan.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.280
This is Jackie Chan.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.640
Here is Jackie Chan.

17:04.640 --> 17:05.280
Zip.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.880
Oh no, excuse myself.

17:06.880 --> 17:07.600
Zip.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.600
That's a great, that is such a great,

17:09.600 --> 17:11.440
like you're married to Jackie Chan.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.600
You're at your friend's New Year's Eve party.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.960
Things are winding down.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.480
Oh no, you shit your pants.

17:17.360 --> 17:18.720
Jackie Chan, take it away.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.240
I need to get out of here.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.040
I've got you.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.640
Hi everybody, I'm Jackie Chan.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.240
Oh my God, where did Griffin go?

17:24.240 --> 17:25.920
Please, you can call me Jacqueline.

17:25.920 --> 17:26.720
Everybody does.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.640
My friends, my closest friends-

17:28.640 --> 17:30.400
My closest friends call me Jacqueline Chan.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.960
He's probably the coolest person ever, right?

17:35.600 --> 17:35.840
Yeah.

17:36.560 --> 17:40.320
I think that he would probably be in my top five people.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.040
I would be like just devastated to find out

17:43.040 --> 17:44.800
was kind of a jerk in real life.

17:44.800 --> 17:51.760
No, you watch somebody like crash a train into him on accident

17:51.760 --> 17:54.720
in those snuff bloopers at the end of his films

17:54.720 --> 17:56.720
and he gets hit by the train and goes flying

17:57.280 --> 17:58.640
and is cut in twain.

17:58.640 --> 17:59.840
But then they like run up to him like,

17:59.840 --> 18:00.640
Jackie, are you okay?

18:00.640 --> 18:02.640
And he looks up and gives a smile and a thumbs up.

18:02.640 --> 18:03.920
That's a dude.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.200
Don't blame the conductor.

18:05.920 --> 18:06.640
It's fine.

18:06.640 --> 18:09.200
I find myself in a bit of a conundrum.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.040
I really enjoy animal companionship,

18:11.040 --> 18:12.880
but my boyfriend is very stern on the opinion

18:12.880 --> 18:15.360
that he doesn't want the responsibility of having a pet.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.240
The most he will even consider allowing me to have

18:18.240 --> 18:19.520
is one of a simple pet rock.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.480
That's cruel and not a real pet.

18:22.480 --> 18:26.000
Brothers, how do I explain to him how important it is

18:26.000 --> 18:27.520
for me to have an animal around the house

18:27.520 --> 18:28.880
that I'll look after without coming off

18:28.880 --> 18:30.080
as I'm trying to wear him down?

18:30.080 --> 18:31.360
He's a listener of the show.

18:31.360 --> 18:31.840
Excellent.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.120
And if anyone could convince him,

18:33.120 --> 18:33.920
it's probably you guys.

18:33.920 --> 18:37.040
Sincerely, Cat Crazy in Canada.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.520
You're gonna start referring to the cat as,

18:39.520 --> 18:40.720
you need a familiar.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.840
Oh, that's good, Travis.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.200
For your magics?

18:45.200 --> 18:47.600
Well, if it gets to that point,

18:47.600 --> 18:49.040
I'm just saying if you don't wanna appear

18:49.040 --> 18:50.560
like you're just trying to wear him down,

18:50.560 --> 18:53.200
just be like, ah, a familiar would really help me

18:53.200 --> 18:54.080
in my research.

18:54.080 --> 18:54.720
Something like that.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.520
You know, just keep dropping those every so often.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.320
You get the familiar before you learn any wizarding.

19:00.320 --> 19:00.640
Yeah.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.240
Think about Harry Potter, right?

19:02.240 --> 19:04.480
There was a point in Harry Potter's life

19:04.480 --> 19:07.680
when he knew no magics, but owned an owl.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.320
At that point in his life-

19:08.320 --> 19:09.840
And that was just okay.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.720
He was just a kid that owned an owl.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.560
Like, what am I supposed to do with this?

19:15.200 --> 19:16.640
That must have been the hardest thing.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.480
Like, when he was getting magic books, cool.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.600
And he got a wand, cool.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.800
And here's a bird of prey.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.880
Here's a big fat bird you have to feed mice to.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.760
That's probably fairly difficult to keep alive.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.080
Like, we're not talking like goldfish here.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.760
Like, this is an owl.

19:33.760 --> 19:36.960
Yeah, and the hardest part about keeping a pet owl alive

19:36.960 --> 19:39.680
is when you wake up and it's in your room

19:39.680 --> 19:42.560
and right next to you, not instinctively murdering it.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.320
Not just instinctively tearing it in half.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.840
Like, oh god, big eyes, bye.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.680
Tear it, rip it.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.600
Could you start, I mean, you gotta start small, right?

19:51.600 --> 19:54.000
You have to start with like a beta,

19:54.000 --> 19:59.040
maybe a nice beta fighting fish, you know, betas.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.120
Nobody has anything against owning a fish.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.360
Like, it's the lowest impact pet.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.040
I would like to suggest another plan.

20:06.880 --> 20:12.080
Release a dozen mice into your home

20:12.080 --> 20:16.880
and then place a call, email or fax to my newly formed business,

20:17.600 --> 20:20.800
Justin McElroy's prohibitively expensive

20:20.800 --> 20:23.360
yet profoundly incompetent pest removal service.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.720
I come to your home and I have a thing on my van

20:26.720 --> 20:28.880
that says the best in the biz, okay?

20:28.880 --> 20:30.400
That is an important statement.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.480
And that's sort of like a general use decal

20:32.480 --> 20:36.960
so that whenever Justin pulls a grip on any sort of trade skill.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.560
Justin McElroy, best in the biz.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.320
And then I show up and I'm like,

20:40.320 --> 20:42.240
oh, I see your problem, you got mice.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.840
And then I do my magic.

20:43.840 --> 20:44.880
I don't know what it'll be.

20:44.880 --> 20:48.400
It'll pretty much just be hooking vacuums up to heating vents

20:48.400 --> 20:50.400
and like doing that for a little while

20:50.400 --> 20:53.200
and saying like, yeah, well, and-

20:53.200 --> 20:55.520
Blowing into things and then waiting.

20:56.240 --> 20:59.520
Throwing cheese out the window and say like, it's there.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.840
And then I'll say, everybody out.

21:01.840 --> 21:02.800
And then I'll wait.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.960
I'll say, well, folks, that'll take care of it.

21:05.520 --> 21:06.160
Then-

21:06.160 --> 21:07.680
That ought to do it.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.240
Then you have two pet options.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.880
Pet option one, you see mice.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.480
Oh, we should call pest removal.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.320
No, what point would there be in that?

21:16.320 --> 21:18.160
We already got the best in the biz

21:18.160 --> 21:20.000
and he couldn't get rid of all these mice.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.360
We're stuck with this mice problem.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.120
So option one, you have pet mice.

21:23.120 --> 21:23.680
That's cool.

21:24.720 --> 21:25.360
Option two-

21:25.360 --> 21:29.440
Cage free roaming, cage free mice.

21:29.440 --> 21:33.680
Option two, and I think you're really gonna love this one.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.200
We've already called the best of the biz.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.680
We've already called the best that humankind has to offer.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.160
We have to take this back to the animal kingdom.

21:41.040 --> 21:44.800
Meet my pet cat, Mr. Hunter, like predator.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.240
Meet my cat predator.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.560
And then you own a cat to keep the mouse population.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.400
But your boyfriend doesn't know how many mice are in there.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.640
You can never get rid of the cat

21:52.640 --> 21:55.120
because you never know when he's gonna find another mouse.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.800
And if you need to keep up the illusion,

21:56.800 --> 21:59.440
release another mouse in there every once in a while.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.960
Justin, I just want you to know

22:00.960 --> 22:03.120
in the scenario of this movie that you've created,

22:03.120 --> 22:04.720
I picture the cat being introduced

22:04.720 --> 22:07.200
very similar to the priest in The Exorcist.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.720
Like at the bottom of a set of stairs

22:08.720 --> 22:12.320
in like one street light, like meet my acquaintance, Mr. Hunter.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.000
And then it's just a cat in a trench coat.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.840
Meow, I'm father predator.

22:18.880 --> 22:19.920
Meow.

22:19.920 --> 22:22.480
And the cat just says best in the biz across the side.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.040
That's key.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.560
I can't emphasize that enough.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.080
Listen, what we're really talking about here

22:28.080 --> 22:30.080
is branding opportunities for Justin's

22:30.080 --> 22:32.000
best in the biz sign making business.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.240
Now, can I ask Justin what you get out of this?

22:34.240 --> 22:37.680
Are you charging a fee for your initial consultation?

22:37.680 --> 22:40.400
Maybe you didn't hear, it's right there in the name.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.400
Prohibitively expensive.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.200
Like if I'm gonna go through all this rigmarole,

22:45.200 --> 22:46.480
I'm gonna get my taste.

22:46.480 --> 22:47.680
I'm gonna get my beque.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.400
And by beque, I mean the chicken

22:50.400 --> 22:52.000
that I also bring to give you as a pet.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.200
Listen, it's a full service business.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.720
What does a chicken do?

22:56.720 --> 22:58.880
Just makes a cat look good by comparison?

22:58.880 --> 23:01.520
A chicken makes eggs, you fucking neanderthal.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.120
I need a book.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.280
Our first sponsor this week is Pro Flowers.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.840
Mother's Day is coming up and you want to show-

23:21.840 --> 23:23.120
It's like six days away?

23:23.120 --> 23:24.880
Is that right?

23:24.880 --> 23:26.400
Well, I mean, it's, well, I mean,

23:26.400 --> 23:28.240
it depends on when this goes up.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.760
Is it gonna go up on May the fourth?

23:29.760 --> 23:32.000
May the fourth, that was our intro.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.120
It was right there.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.520
And another missed observation.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.400
Make it up to your mom that you missed Star Wars Day

23:39.280 --> 23:44.000
with a glass of 100 blooms with a free glass vase

23:44.640 --> 23:46.240
for just $19.99.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.840
You can make that day extra special

23:47.840 --> 23:52.800
and add some chocolates for $9.99 more.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.320
Just go to proflowers.com

23:54.320 --> 23:55.840
and you're gonna click the blue microphone

23:55.840 --> 23:56.880
at the top corner

23:56.880 --> 23:59.280
and you're gonna type in the code MYBROTHER.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.400
Sydney, we got a vase of these flowers sent to us.

24:04.400 --> 24:07.120
They were Peruvian lilies

24:07.120 --> 24:10.400
and they were now Sydney's favorite flowers.

24:10.400 --> 24:13.840
They are really, really beautiful and it's a great deal.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.000
So go to proflowers.com,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.240
click the blue microphone in the top right corner

24:18.240 --> 24:21.920
and type in the code MYBROTHER and get that great deal.

24:21.920 --> 24:25.360
Now say that this is the first episode

24:25.360 --> 24:26.640
someone's ever listened to

24:26.640 --> 24:28.560
and they're like, what's this guy talking about

24:28.560 --> 24:29.760
about his undies?

24:29.760 --> 24:31.200
Why is he saying me undies?

24:31.200 --> 24:32.320
Why is he speaking?

24:32.320 --> 24:33.440
It's this product placement

24:33.440 --> 24:36.880
because I cannot imagine a less appealing product placement

24:36.880 --> 24:39.840
than thinking about my brother wearing me undies

24:39.840 --> 24:42.640
and getting them super duper oily and squishy

24:42.640 --> 24:44.080
from massage juices.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.560
They pull moisture away from your skin

24:46.560 --> 24:48.880
so you're cool all day long down there.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.640
I just wore them to a rent fair yesterday,

24:50.640 --> 24:52.640
walked around for four and a half hours

24:52.640 --> 24:54.960
whilst drinking ale and eating,

24:54.960 --> 24:57.040
I ate a quail, which was pretty cool.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.800
Turns out I wasn't supposed to.

24:58.800 --> 24:59.680
They were very ugly.

24:59.680 --> 25:00.960
You got the quail and ale special?

25:02.400 --> 25:03.760
We watched a joust.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.760
My joust person lost.

25:07.840 --> 25:08.880
It was very sad,

25:08.880 --> 25:11.680
but me undies kept my zone very dry.

25:11.680 --> 25:15.120
If me undies can make Travis cool at a rent fair,

25:15.680 --> 25:19.040
they are capable of some pretty goddamn superhuman feats.

25:19.040 --> 25:22.880
They are the Jackie Chan of delicates.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.720
Right now, this is a great deal.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.160
meundies.com slash my brother.

25:26.160 --> 25:30.400
You can get 20% off your first order and free shipping.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.680
We've had so many listeners try these

25:31.680 --> 25:33.280
and they absolutely adore them.

25:33.280 --> 25:35.120
They're never going back to regular underwear.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.640
Don't get that six pack for eight cents.

25:38.640 --> 25:39.440
That's gross.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.360
Who knows what's in there?

25:41.360 --> 25:43.760
meundies.com slash my brother.

25:43.760 --> 25:44.880
For men and women.

25:44.880 --> 25:45.920
For everyone.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.120
Yeah, for everyone.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.720
They're fantastic underwear.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.160
And you're just gonna love them.

25:50.160 --> 25:53.840
I have a message here for Will and it's from Alita.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.200
And Alita says to Will,

25:55.200 --> 25:57.440
Will, we've been married for two years now.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.640
Can you believe it?

25:58.640 --> 26:00.720
And we're coming up on 10 years together.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.560
I'm really happy about it.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.320
I think you're just so great.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.560
You can make this sound really sarcastic.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.520
I think you're just so great.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.280
Really, the greatest.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.800
I love you more than everything.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.280
Here's to all the future years of our super fun life.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.320
Love, Alita.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.720
Do you love that this is the first non-ironic

26:20.720 --> 26:23.600
actually kind message that we've gotten in literally months

26:23.600 --> 26:27.200
and we managed to turn it into something dark and despicable?

26:27.200 --> 26:28.240
We're bad people.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.440
We're terrible, terrible people.

26:29.440 --> 26:30.720
Thank you for not just being like,

26:30.720 --> 26:33.760
hey, I'm gonna make Griffin say dog farts now.

26:33.760 --> 26:34.400
Here I go.

26:35.040 --> 26:35.840
You did it all right.

26:35.840 --> 26:38.240
That was actually their plan was to get you to say dog farts

26:38.240 --> 26:41.120
and they just like took you way around the bend.

26:41.120 --> 26:42.400
That's a deep con.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.000
That's a deep 2015.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.640
I have another message though,

26:46.640 --> 26:48.400
and it's for Jorge Aviles.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.120
God, do you think I hit that?

26:51.120 --> 26:53.120
I think you nailed it.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.600
It's for Jorge Aviles and it's from Melissa.

26:55.600 --> 26:56.560
You had to give it another pass in there.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.000
You had to go back for it.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.760
You got a double dunk.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.920
And it's from Melissa who says,

27:01.920 --> 27:05.520
Jorge, thank you for introducing me to the brothers

27:05.520 --> 27:07.520
on that road trip we took to Big Bend.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.200
Beautiful, beautiful park.

27:09.200 --> 27:12.240
Thank you for letting me share in the therapeutic nature

27:12.240 --> 27:13.600
that is Mabim Bam.

27:13.600 --> 27:14.880
Laughing alongside with you

27:14.880 --> 27:17.040
while listening to their goofs is priceless.

27:17.040 --> 27:17.920
Happy birthday.

27:17.920 --> 27:20.400
Love always, your Babi or baby.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.600
I think it's Babi.

27:21.600 --> 27:22.480
Probably Babi.

27:22.480 --> 27:23.520
I think it's Babadook.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.920
If it's a show reference, it's probably Babi.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.640
Love always, your Babadook.

27:32.640 --> 27:36.400
I'm glad here that Melissa has acknowledged

27:36.400 --> 27:39.200
the therapeutic nature of MBMBM.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.000
Not enough people talk about the recovery

27:42.000 --> 27:42.960
that can be accomplished

27:42.960 --> 27:45.680
just by simply listening to our episodes.

27:45.680 --> 27:48.960
Physical, mental, emotional.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.840
We'll adjust your fucking energons for free.

27:51.840 --> 27:52.480
For nothing.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.160
If you went to an energon specialist,

27:55.200 --> 27:56.800
they're gonna charge you like 60 bucks an hour.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.440
No one's gonna get mad at you for moaning

27:59.440 --> 28:01.680
during a My Brother and My Brother and Me episode.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.480
Yeah, I just assume,

28:02.480 --> 28:03.760
I've never listened to our show before,

28:03.760 --> 28:05.600
but I just assume that people who listen to our show

28:05.600 --> 28:08.000
are just constantly like, oh, yeah.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.680
Yeah, oh, man.

28:09.680 --> 28:10.400
Oh, yeah.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.360
Oh, I'm gonna.

28:11.360 --> 28:11.920
Ecstasy.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.360
Oh, the pleasure.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.400
I'm gonna nut.

28:17.200 --> 28:17.700
Gross.

28:18.800 --> 28:19.300
Gross.

28:19.920 --> 28:20.880
I hate it.

28:20.880 --> 28:21.440
I hate it.

28:25.840 --> 28:29.280
Hi, I'm Julie Sabatier, host of Rendered.

28:29.280 --> 28:32.000
It's a show about making meaning and breaking rules.

28:32.640 --> 28:35.200
We're answering important questions like,

28:35.200 --> 28:37.440
can you build a space suit in your living room?

28:37.440 --> 28:39.280
I went to my brother's place in Beaverton,

28:39.280 --> 28:41.600
and he has a swimming pool, and I pressurized the suit

28:41.600 --> 28:43.600
and sat down there underwater for about 10 minutes.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.520
The thing that I built was supporting my life.

28:45.520 --> 28:46.480
That felt really good.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.760
What does it sound like when you play a polka record

28:49.760 --> 28:51.120
through a styrofoam cup?

28:56.080 --> 28:58.400
And what happens when an airport carpet

28:58.400 --> 29:00.160
gains a cult following?

29:00.160 --> 29:00.880
Oh, my goodness.

29:01.600 --> 29:02.880
The carpet has an Instagram.

29:03.600 --> 29:06.480
Check out Rendered now at maximumfun.org

29:06.480 --> 29:08.480

29:10.320 --> 29:11.280
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

29:11.840 --> 29:12.640
Yeah, Griffin.

29:12.640 --> 29:13.760
I would love one.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.920
This one was sent in by YadruDru at Drew Davenport.

29:15.920 --> 29:16.400
Thank you, Drew.

29:16.400 --> 29:19.040
It's by Yadru Answers user, Lane, who asks,

29:20.800 --> 29:24.400
is there such a thing as spirit sitting

29:24.400 --> 29:25.520
that you can be paid for?

29:26.960 --> 29:28.400
Is it like babysitting?

29:28.400 --> 29:31.760
Like babysitting and being paid for your time.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.120
Oh, I was joking.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.080
For reals?

29:34.720 --> 29:36.000
It says update.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.840
The loudest like a whining baby

29:37.840 --> 29:39.680
crawling all over and in you.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.480
And that's not even information.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.160
That's not, that's not, that's a,

29:44.160 --> 29:47.200
that's a goddamn EE coming slam poem.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.600
I have a question.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.800
Griffin, read the exact phrasing of the question again.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.240
Is there such a thing as spirit sitting

29:56.240 --> 29:57.600
that you can be paid for?

29:57.600 --> 29:59.840
Like babysitting and being paid for your time.

29:59.840 --> 30:00.640
Time out.

30:00.640 --> 30:04.320
That is a person who wants to get into this field

30:04.320 --> 30:08.320
and would like to be paid for their abilities

30:08.320 --> 30:09.200
with spirit sitting.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.360
And then the further details are

30:12.320 --> 30:14.320
the loudest like a whining baby

30:14.320 --> 30:16.160
crawling all over and in you.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.920
Okay, that's what happened here.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.520
This person put up this question

30:19.520 --> 30:21.520
and then they thought, well, I better get better at it

30:21.520 --> 30:23.360
in case anyone says yes.

30:23.360 --> 30:26.720
And then they got too big, too quick.

30:26.720 --> 30:30.160
They got into some shit they didn't understand.

30:30.160 --> 30:33.040
They got into some dark, some of his dark materials

30:33.040 --> 30:35.760
and they, and they, and they opened the door way wide to.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.520
His, his capital H.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.600
His, his dark material.

30:40.400 --> 30:41.360
Well, Lucifer, but yes.

30:41.360 --> 30:41.840
Oh, okay.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.920
I was a babysitter for a summer

30:43.920 --> 30:47.200
and it basically involved me helping

30:48.080 --> 30:50.960
one of the children beat all the very hard bosses

30:50.960 --> 30:51.920
in Kingdom Hearts.

30:52.480 --> 30:55.200
And I don't think that a spirit is going to be

30:56.240 --> 30:57.280
quite as chill.

30:57.280 --> 30:58.320
It's gonna be me.

30:58.320 --> 31:00.800
It's gonna be me just constantly walking around

31:00.800 --> 31:02.400
shutting cabinet doors.

31:02.400 --> 31:03.440
Very funny.

31:03.440 --> 31:05.200
Real funny spirit.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.000
Pretty good stuff.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.400
I go into the bathroom and I use the bathroom

31:08.400 --> 31:09.760
and when I wash my hands,

31:09.760 --> 31:12.160
all the skin falls off of my face in the mirror

31:12.160 --> 31:14.720
and it's like, ah, it got me again, spirit.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.640
Oh, you jokester.

31:16.640 --> 31:17.280
Check this out.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.160
You ready?

31:18.160 --> 31:20.400
Mary Poppins, except for ghost children,

31:20.400 --> 31:22.080
you're welcome, Tim Burton.

31:22.080 --> 31:25.680
Please enjoy the movie that I have just written for you.

31:25.680 --> 31:26.640
Oh my God, it's already out

31:26.640 --> 31:28.000
and I'm looking at it on Rotten Tomatoes,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.320
2%, 2% on Rotten Tomatoes.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.280
Widely panned.

31:31.280 --> 31:34.720
Helena Bonham Carter is Mary Spookins

31:34.720 --> 31:37.600
and, thank you, Griffin.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.800
A spoonful of poison.

31:43.920 --> 31:45.440
That's my Helena Bonham Carter impression.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.520
Why would you poison ghosts, Griffin?

31:47.520 --> 31:49.120
That doesn't make any sense.

31:49.120 --> 31:50.080
Because they're already dead

31:50.080 --> 31:52.080
and it's like what they're into.

31:52.080 --> 31:56.000
A spoonful of holy water banishes you to the great beyond.

31:57.120 --> 31:59.440
Supercalifragilisticexpialis, oh shit.

31:59.440 --> 32:02.720
Ghost, she got scared by a ghost.

32:02.720 --> 32:02.960
Sure.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.920
The good news is there is someone

32:05.920 --> 32:09.040
who gets paid to sit spirits for you.

32:09.040 --> 32:10.640
Go to your living room window,

32:10.640 --> 32:12.320
look out at the street, there's a van there.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.920
What's that van say on the side?

32:13.920 --> 32:15.520
It says the best in the biz.

32:15.520 --> 32:16.240
It's me.

32:16.240 --> 32:18.400
Now Justin, what do you bring to the table

32:18.400 --> 32:21.280
that makes you the best in the biz at ghost sitting?

32:21.280 --> 32:22.320
A Ouija board.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.160
I put it right on that table and I say,

32:24.160 --> 32:26.080
let's sort this out.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.120
Why are you still here?

32:27.120 --> 32:30.480
And then I do, I'm the best of the biz.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.480
So I say I got rid of them.

32:32.480 --> 32:35.680
And what I do then is if you tell me the ghosts are back,

32:35.680 --> 32:36.960
I just say, you're insane.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.480
You're actually an insane person.

32:38.480 --> 32:39.200
You need to go to the head doctor.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.640
No, you just say that's a different ghost.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.000
I'll take care of that one too.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
You got, oh, it looks like you just,

32:44.000 --> 32:45.760
you got ghosts up in the rafters.

32:45.760 --> 32:48.320
I'm looking up here, you got some ghost damage in the corner.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.480
No, Travis, I'm expanding the sale.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.400
I'll say you are insane.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.640
You need a head doctor, preferably one

32:54.640 --> 32:58.160
that makes house calls look outside your window.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.200
There's a van outside.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.800
You step out of it.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.640
David Blaine, what the fuck?

33:02.640 --> 33:03.440
How do you do it?

33:04.880 --> 33:06.720
You were David Blaine the whole time.

33:06.720 --> 33:10.160
Best in the biz for psychiatric issues.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.480
I come up and I help you that way too.

33:12.480 --> 33:14.080
I help you in every way imaginable.

33:14.080 --> 33:14.720
I'm gonna hit you with this.

33:14.720 --> 33:17.200
You throw down the Ouija, throw down that Ouija board.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.600
You say ghost, what is your unfinished business?

33:19.600 --> 33:20.880
I'm trying to sit you.

33:20.880 --> 33:24.160
And the triangle, the glass triangle starts moving.

33:24.160 --> 33:25.600
And very slowly it spells out,

33:26.400 --> 33:29.520
I need help beating Jafar in Kingdom Hearts.

33:29.520 --> 33:32.080
I'm having a very hard time with the Jafar boss fight.

33:32.080 --> 33:32.880
Can you help me?

33:32.880 --> 33:35.040
And I'm like, yeah, dude, I got this.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.880
The secret is you wanna use Thundaga.

33:38.080 --> 33:41.600
The greatest test of your Kingdom Hearts acumen

33:41.600 --> 33:45.600
is to give clues through Ouija board to say how to beat it.

33:45.600 --> 33:46.880
You have to have some fast hands.

33:46.880 --> 33:49.760
Well, no, Justin, the Ouija board is not a two-way thing.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.280
You could just say out,

33:51.280 --> 33:52.880
you don't need to use the Ouija board

33:52.880 --> 33:54.080
to send messages to them.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.280
Yes, Travis, that's true.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.760
But Griffin is unable to see the ghost monitor.

33:57.760 --> 34:00.000
So information about what is currently on the screen.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.320
Right, they're playing PlayStation in the spirit realm.

34:04.320 --> 34:06.320
Right, where all dead PlayStations go.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.560
Right, I don't know what kind of equipment they have.

34:08.560 --> 34:11.360
I don't know how they've got goofy kidded out.

34:12.640 --> 34:15.280
One of my closest friends recently started selling cosmetics.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.440
While I'm glad she found a way to make some extra money,

34:17.440 --> 34:19.280
she's always asking me if I wanna buy some.

34:19.280 --> 34:21.840
Even explain that she needs to hit her monthly sales goals.

34:21.840 --> 34:24.800
As a friend, am I obligated to just help her out

34:24.800 --> 34:26.080
and buy this stuff I don't need?

34:26.080 --> 34:28.400
And that's from not buying it in Boston.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.680
Sounds like you've already made up your mind.

34:31.040 --> 34:32.960
Why not just hand her money and just say,

34:32.960 --> 34:34.320
do you need it that badly?

34:34.320 --> 34:35.120
Here's 10 bucks.

34:35.120 --> 34:35.760
Here's $500.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.680
I don't need any cream.

34:38.640 --> 34:39.920
The cream doesn't expire.

34:39.920 --> 34:41.120
Why don't you just stockpile?

34:42.480 --> 34:45.920
Listen, I totally get this question.

34:45.920 --> 34:48.160
I mean, in this day and age-

34:48.160 --> 34:49.920
Travis sells a lot of chocolate bars

34:49.920 --> 34:52.240
to try and pay for his band trip.

34:52.240 --> 34:54.480
Listen, we're just trying to get to King's Island, you guys.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.680
We just need this money.

34:55.680 --> 34:59.040
Isn't this the reason that these businesses exist?

34:59.040 --> 35:01.440
I mean, cause nobody's really selling the shit to strangers.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.920
Nobody goes door to door anymore with this stuff.

35:03.920 --> 35:08.400
They're sitting there and you're doing a birthday party

35:08.400 --> 35:10.400
and you're like, well, you know what would help

35:10.400 --> 35:11.200
with that problem?

35:11.200 --> 35:14.480
I'm sorry, overheard you talking about bags under your eyes.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.760
I have this product.

35:15.760 --> 35:18.320
That's why it exists so that you can get your friends

35:18.320 --> 35:19.040
into doing it.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.440
You throw a small packet of cream at their eyes

35:21.440 --> 35:23.520
and it explodes and covers them

35:23.520 --> 35:25.280
and you've just cream bombed them

35:25.280 --> 35:26.960
and then they have to pay for it.

35:27.840 --> 35:28.800
That's a good sales tag.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.320
That's how you become best in the biz.

35:30.320 --> 35:32.240
I'm coming for your throne, Justin.

35:32.240 --> 35:33.120
Come at my throne.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.680
Can I ask why it's always cosmetics?

35:35.680 --> 35:37.280
Cause if it was literally anything else,

35:37.280 --> 35:38.000
I would be totally down.

35:38.000 --> 35:38.800
If I have a friend that was like,

35:38.800 --> 35:40.960
listen, I have a hard time making my quota.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.960
I'm selling nature box snacks.

35:42.960 --> 35:45.360
I would be like, I'll sign me up for just everything.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.360
I'll buy all of everything you got.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.520
I'll drink up all the nature box you got on the shelf.

35:50.080 --> 35:51.920
Just let me introduce myself.

35:51.920 --> 35:55.760
My name is, and then I start eating some pistachios.

35:56.560 --> 35:57.520
Pistachios.

35:57.520 --> 35:58.240
What?

35:58.240 --> 35:59.040
Pistachios.

35:59.680 --> 36:00.640
Pistachios?

36:00.640 --> 36:01.360
Pistachios.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.360
It's pistachios with extra potassium.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.480
I once went on a great Twitter run

36:06.480 --> 36:08.960
where I was just coming up with the top 10 nicknames

36:08.960 --> 36:10.080
for pistachios.

36:10.080 --> 36:10.800
What do you guys got?

36:12.160 --> 36:13.520
Okay, here's some of the minds.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.200
Stashies, great.

36:15.200 --> 36:15.760
P-bombs.

36:15.760 --> 36:18.080
What about little nut purse?

36:18.720 --> 36:19.040
What?

36:19.040 --> 36:19.760
Nut purses?

36:19.760 --> 36:20.400
That's excellent.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.120
Little nut purse.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.280
How about oyster crunch?

36:24.160 --> 36:26.080
Because it's like a little oyster

36:26.080 --> 36:27.360
and you crack it and you get a little crunch.

36:28.800 --> 36:29.360
I went with pistachios.

36:29.360 --> 36:30.160
Little greenies.

36:30.160 --> 36:30.960
Green nuts.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.160
Green nuts, okay.

36:32.160 --> 36:32.960
I think the problem-

36:32.960 --> 36:33.440
Pistachios.

36:33.440 --> 36:35.680
Pistachios?

36:35.680 --> 36:36.320
I like that.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.560
The problem with this question is,

36:38.560 --> 36:40.320
I get that because when your friend's like,

36:40.320 --> 36:42.320
hey, do you want to buy some of my wares?

36:42.320 --> 36:45.920
And you know that they're trying to make money

36:45.920 --> 36:47.120
and do it as a business,

36:47.120 --> 36:49.280
it's really hard to look back on them and be like,

36:49.280 --> 36:52.160
no, I can buy this cheaper somewhere else

36:52.160 --> 36:56.160
and I support you doing it, just not financially.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.040
That's tough.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.720
Yeah, that's right, Travis.

36:58.720 --> 37:01.440
This person has literally said exactly that.

37:01.440 --> 37:02.800
That this is a hard situation.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.800
I'm trying to get us back onto actually helping them

37:04.800 --> 37:07.200
and not so much talking about pistachios.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.280
I was terrified of the sales career

37:11.280 --> 37:13.840
at an early age because of my exposure to the play

37:13.840 --> 37:15.120
Death of a Salesman.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.880
Here's what Death of a Salesman tells you

37:16.880 --> 37:18.400
about selling things.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.400
If you're really good at it,

37:20.400 --> 37:22.400
eventually you're gonna be Willy Loman

37:22.400 --> 37:23.680
because the, I don't know,

37:23.680 --> 37:25.520
the things will change

37:25.520 --> 37:27.120
and you won't be able to sell the widgets good enough.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.480
Option two, it's going bad.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.560
Psych, you're already Willy Loman.

37:32.560 --> 37:35.920
Uh-oh, you missed your chance to get off the bus.

37:36.560 --> 37:37.920
Don't be a salesperson.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.360
Everyone ends up like Willy Loman.

37:39.360 --> 37:42.480
But can't you also end up like Alec Baldwin

37:42.480 --> 37:44.640
from Glengarry Glen Ross and always be closing?

37:45.280 --> 37:46.480
You'd love that, wouldn't you, Travis?

37:46.480 --> 37:49.840
I mean, as long as we're making play references.

37:49.840 --> 37:53.440
See, Travis, that's a fictional piece of work.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.400
That's a fictional play.

37:54.400 --> 37:54.880
Oh, I see.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.360
Salesmen die all the time.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.200
That's just for real.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.160
But do they ever truly live?

38:03.280 --> 38:05.360
I work at a small office inches away

38:05.360 --> 38:06.640
from three other people.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.560
We all get along well and then spend time

38:08.560 --> 38:10.080
talking as we work.

38:11.600 --> 38:12.640
This sounds good so far.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.840
I don't know why you would need this.

38:15.520 --> 38:16.960
Sometimes we have lunches together.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.080
It is enjoyable.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.640
Later on, I go home and perhaps make some dinner

38:20.640 --> 38:21.040
and watch a movie.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.400
Anyway, anyway, good night.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.160
Good night, man in the moon.

38:28.320 --> 38:31.040
Another Grand Slam day in my cool life.

38:32.720 --> 38:35.360
Had some good talks, had some chicken pot pie.

38:35.360 --> 38:38.480
Pretty good all there.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.160
Tomorrow's Debra's birthday.

38:40.160 --> 38:42.400
We're going out for afternoon drinks.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.000
I'll get to that laundry tomorrow.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.120
It's no problem.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.000
He'll still be there.

38:48.080 --> 38:51.040
One guy, though, will put on his headphones

38:51.040 --> 38:53.040
and tune us out until we start laughing

38:53.040 --> 38:54.960
or the conversation sounds interesting.

38:54.960 --> 38:57.040
Then he pops up his head and says,

38:57.040 --> 38:58.400
what are you talking about?

38:58.400 --> 38:59.200
Oh, my God.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.000
He does this at least five times a day.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.160
We have to repeat the entire conversation

39:04.160 --> 39:06.640
to him every time and it's making me crazy.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.000
Just pay attention.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.600
Brothers, how can I keep my cool

39:09.600 --> 39:12.400
and still have work chats around this guy?

39:12.400 --> 39:14.240
That's from vexed in Vancouver.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.440
Oh, Vancouver.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.600
I'd love to go by there sometime.

39:17.600 --> 39:22.880
Maybe make a visit there on, I don't know, August 30th.

39:22.880 --> 39:23.760
Does that sound good?

39:23.760 --> 39:24.480
Yeah, it's a date.

39:24.480 --> 39:25.600
Yeah, I think I can work that.

39:25.600 --> 39:26.240
I'll do that.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.440
If you want to see me there,

39:29.440 --> 39:33.600
go to bit.ly forward slash van, M-B-A-M and buy a ticket.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.640
Anyway, more on that later.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.440
More on that later.

39:40.560 --> 39:44.000
God, it's rare when a person possesses

39:44.800 --> 39:50.080
this sort of robotic work ethic strategy

39:50.080 --> 39:52.720
and also like chronic FOMO.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.320
Or it's like, you can't have both.

39:54.320 --> 39:56.480
You can't get the best of both worlds.

39:56.480 --> 39:58.960
Either do your business and be a good business boy

39:59.520 --> 40:03.440
or be like a lunchtime fun boy, but you cannot be both.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.120
You cannot be both.

40:05.120 --> 40:05.840
I have an idea.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.600
A lunchtime fun boy and a good business boy.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.560
That's too true, Griffin.

40:09.120 --> 40:10.080
I have an idea.

40:10.080 --> 40:10.720
Hit me, Travis.

40:11.280 --> 40:13.200
Every 20 minutes or so,

40:14.240 --> 40:16.640
lean over and ask him what he's listening to.

40:18.160 --> 40:18.960
Oh my god.

40:18.960 --> 40:20.720
And then have him tell you about it

40:20.720 --> 40:22.960
and then lean back and like 30 minutes later,

40:22.960 --> 40:25.520
ask him again and do that until he's like,

40:25.520 --> 40:26.960
hey man, why do you keep doing that?

40:26.960 --> 40:28.080
And be like, because you do it.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.160
Because you do it, Steve.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.920
Get the fuck out, you're fired.

40:31.920 --> 40:36.480
What if he's like, Dave, the guy I used to work with at TriData

40:36.480 --> 40:40.960
and the answer to that question is always C&C Music Factory.

40:43.600 --> 40:47.600
It is always the same C&C Music Factory cassette tape.

40:49.200 --> 40:52.640
I think that that would be a pretty cool work day, honestly.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.320
I'm a big fan of their work.

40:54.880 --> 40:58.560
I recently in the car treated Sydney

40:58.560 --> 41:02.960
to my recitation of all the lyrics that are gonna make you sweat

41:02.960 --> 41:04.960
and she was not as impressed.

41:04.960 --> 41:08.000
Every time he asks what you're laughing or talking about,

41:08.000 --> 41:11.520
look him dead in his eye jellies and say, you.

41:12.800 --> 41:13.360
Every time.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.760
Every single time.

41:15.760 --> 41:17.920
You, we're talking about you again.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.080
He takes them off five minutes later.

41:20.080 --> 41:21.040
Hey, what's all the hub?

41:21.040 --> 41:22.320
It's you, I promise.

41:23.040 --> 41:25.520
We're laughing at you and talking about you.

41:25.520 --> 41:26.320
And not in a fun, nice way.

41:26.320 --> 41:29.440
He'll have to keep his headphones off then.

41:29.440 --> 41:30.960
How about one more Yahoo?

41:30.960 --> 41:31.840
I just wanna get to it.

41:31.840 --> 41:32.640
I love one.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.080
It's sent in again by Drew Davenport.

41:34.080 --> 41:34.800
Thank you, Drew.

41:34.800 --> 41:37.120
Patrick, you did it again.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kat who asks,

41:42.240 --> 41:45.520
is crying over a celebrity normal?

41:47.760 --> 41:50.720
I want everybody, I want everybody to predict now.

41:50.720 --> 41:52.640
I know you're thinking Zayn Malik, maybe,

41:52.640 --> 41:58.320
who the celeb in question, this person has sent forward this quandary.

41:59.120 --> 42:02.000
Is crying over a celebrity normal, Kat asks.

42:03.040 --> 42:07.520
For no reason, I have been crying over Willem Dafoe.

42:10.400 --> 42:13.120
I was in my room watching one of his interviews

42:13.120 --> 42:16.080
and when it finished, I turned it over to watch TV.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.240
A few days later, I burst out in tears

42:18.240 --> 42:20.640
and I don't know if it was me thinking about Willem

42:20.640 --> 42:22.960
or if it was something else.

42:22.960 --> 42:25.840
I haven't been paying attention to him as much as I used to.

42:25.840 --> 42:28.160
I have been doing it for a few days.

42:28.160 --> 42:30.000
My boyfriend knows the reason for my crying

42:30.000 --> 42:31.520
and he's comforted me about it.

42:31.520 --> 42:33.440
My friend Maggie told me to stop crying

42:33.440 --> 42:35.680
and to just shut up about Willem Dafoe.

42:39.680 --> 42:42.720
I have looked up to him since I was nine years old.

42:42.720 --> 42:44.320
I'm 17 now though.

42:44.320 --> 42:47.280
My boyfriend said, just remember, I'm here for you

42:47.280 --> 42:49.680
if you need anything or if you wanna talk about things

42:49.680 --> 42:51.520
like celebrities, then I'm here for you.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.920
If you guys are gonna say it's your hormones, it's not.

42:53.920 --> 42:56.080
I can tell you this has been going on for days.

42:56.080 --> 42:58.800
I go outside a lot, so don't say it's that either.

42:58.800 --> 42:59.920
Could someone please help me?

42:59.920 --> 43:01.600
Is crying over a celebrity normal?

43:03.120 --> 43:04.880
But do you think her boyfriend said it

43:04.880 --> 43:08.560
as he was furtively throwing his personal possessions

43:08.560 --> 43:11.120
in a bag and buying plane tickets to anywhere else?

43:11.120 --> 43:13.360
Yeah, just give me a call whenever, I gotta go.

43:13.360 --> 43:14.880
Gotta go, bye.

43:14.880 --> 43:15.840
But she does.

43:15.840 --> 43:18.720
Is that window reinforced or, you know what,

43:18.720 --> 43:20.080
I'll figure it out.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.760
Nevermind, bye.

43:21.760 --> 43:25.680
Griffin, does she at any point in that question state?

43:25.680 --> 43:28.400
Okay, that's what I wanna get to.

43:28.400 --> 43:31.760
It's not like I heard Willem Dafoe singing

43:31.760 --> 43:34.240
like a beautiful angel and it brought me to tears

43:34.240 --> 43:37.920
or I heard Willem Dafoe talk about the death

43:37.920 --> 43:40.080
of his grandfather and how sad it was

43:40.080 --> 43:43.040
and it resonated with me on a very intimate level.

43:43.040 --> 43:48.040
No, it's just this person is going Willem Dafoe,

43:48.040 --> 43:51.240
like, oh my, wait, hold on, wait.

43:51.240 --> 43:56.240
Willem Dafoe is, he is, he exists.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.840
I think what this person is experiencing is guilt

44:02.840 --> 44:04.400
is because they said in the question

44:04.400 --> 44:06.520
that she doesn't think about Willem Dafoe

44:06.520 --> 44:07.880
as much as she used to.

44:07.880 --> 44:10.520
So maybe she feels like, hey, you know what

44:10.520 --> 44:12.720
I haven't been making enough of lately?

44:12.720 --> 44:13.800
Willem time.

44:13.800 --> 44:16.720
So it's like the scene in Toy Story 3

44:16.720 --> 44:19.400
where Andy comes across like all the old toys

44:19.400 --> 44:20.960
and she's sitting there thinking,

44:20.960 --> 44:24.840
I need to pass Willem Dafoe onto a six-year-old girl.

44:24.840 --> 44:26.680
I need to find a six-year-old girl

44:26.680 --> 44:28.480
and give her Willem Dafoe.

44:28.480 --> 44:29.840
It's me, Willem Dafoe.

44:29.840 --> 44:32.200
Have you thought about me lately?

44:32.200 --> 44:35.480
I noticed you haven't gone to see Grand Budapest Hotel.

44:38.600 --> 44:40.240
I don't know if I can take it.

44:41.640 --> 44:42.880
Finish it.

44:42.880 --> 44:47.840
What if Willem Dafoe showed up every time anybody prayed?

44:47.840 --> 44:52.840
Smash the windows out, like, finish it.

44:53.680 --> 44:57.200
I was about to, give me a second, Willem.

44:57.200 --> 44:59.080
And are you wearing a green goblin costume

44:59.080 --> 45:03.520
that you made for yourself out of cardboard boxes?

45:03.520 --> 45:04.740
That looks terrible.

45:06.880 --> 45:07.920
Finish it.

45:07.920 --> 45:09.720
Okay, just give me a second.

45:09.720 --> 45:14.340
And make sure you throw in an extra one for me.

45:14.340 --> 45:15.540
An extra prayer?

45:15.540 --> 45:16.380
What are you?

45:16.380 --> 45:17.620
An extra prayer for me.

45:17.620 --> 45:18.940
God won't listen to me anymore.

45:18.940 --> 45:20.980
I need all the help I can get.

45:22.860 --> 45:24.220
Anything you got.

45:24.220 --> 45:25.700
Forgive me, Father.

45:25.700 --> 45:27.580
It's been a while since my last confession.

45:27.580 --> 45:30.720
And also on the last one that I did,

45:30.720 --> 45:32.540
I forgot to pray for Willem Dafoe.

45:32.540 --> 45:35.020
And I feel super duper guilty about that.

45:36.060 --> 45:36.900
You should.

45:36.900 --> 45:37.820
Oh God, no.

45:37.820 --> 45:38.980
Wait, how did you?

45:38.980 --> 45:41.620
Is there a celebrity that when you guys think about-

45:41.620 --> 45:43.820
Them existing, they're existing.

45:43.820 --> 45:47.260
Just the thought of them moves you to tears.

45:48.920 --> 45:52.500
I'm betting that there's probably at least one.

45:52.500 --> 45:53.380
I'm trying to.

45:53.380 --> 45:56.100
I'm trying to work up a couple big fat tears

45:56.100 --> 45:57.860
thinking about somebody.

45:57.860 --> 45:58.740
Up, up, up, up, up.

45:58.740 --> 45:59.580
I got it.

45:59.580 --> 46:01.100
William Daniels.

46:01.100 --> 46:02.540
Mr. Feeny.

46:02.540 --> 46:03.380
John Adams.

46:03.380 --> 46:04.220
It's pretty solid.

46:04.220 --> 46:09.220
Just kind of, oh, there they come.

46:22.620 --> 46:26.580
Griffin's sadness sounds like a wounded animal.

46:26.580 --> 46:27.660
Don't you interrupt him.

46:27.660 --> 46:29.260
You get it all out, Griffin.

46:29.260 --> 46:34.260
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta Google

46:35.100 --> 46:37.660
and make sure he's in Girl Meets World, a lot.

46:48.980 --> 46:50.220
Don't stop.

46:50.220 --> 46:51.940
This is the first step in healing.

46:57.140 --> 46:58.500
People are apparently confused.

46:58.500 --> 46:59.620
He is in Girl Meets World.

46:59.620 --> 47:02.580
People are confused as to whether or not he is a ghost.

47:03.420 --> 47:07.380
There is some confusion on Girl Meets World

47:07.380 --> 47:08.860
as to whether or not Mr. Feeny,

47:08.860 --> 47:10.980
the character from Boy Meets World is a ghost or not.

47:10.980 --> 47:13.420
Hey, Girl Meets World, how's your storytelling?

47:13.420 --> 47:14.380
Pretty good.

47:14.380 --> 47:15.900
Cause people don't seem to be sure

47:15.900 --> 47:18.020
whether or not one of your major characters is a ghost

47:18.020 --> 47:20.660
or is a human existing person.

47:20.660 --> 47:23.060
Do you think that that's part of the natural progression

47:23.060 --> 47:24.040
as an actor?

47:24.040 --> 47:26.700
You go from like playing a leading man

47:26.700 --> 47:30.900
to like a more wizened sort of like grandfatherly presence

47:30.900 --> 47:33.480
to anytime you're on screen,

47:33.480 --> 47:35.820
it is questioned whether or not you are a ghost.

47:35.820 --> 47:36.780
It's just people assume,

47:36.780 --> 47:38.620
like I'm in that phase of my career.

47:38.620 --> 47:40.100
The ghost phase.

47:40.100 --> 47:41.660
I'm in the Sir Alec Guinness phase

47:41.660 --> 47:44.080
where I only play ghosts in all of my movies.

47:45.900 --> 47:48.420
I need someone to come and house sit

47:48.420 --> 47:50.200
for my William Daniels ghost.

47:51.460 --> 47:52.820
He gets very scared at night.

47:52.820 --> 47:54.900
He is uncontrollable.

47:54.900 --> 47:59.420
He gets, if he doesn't lay down to sleep by 7 p.m.,

47:59.420 --> 48:01.460
oh, there is just no dealing with him.

48:01.460 --> 48:04.420
It sounds like a job for one van.

48:04.420 --> 48:06.240
You know who that is?

48:06.240 --> 48:07.980
Van Morrison?

48:07.980 --> 48:08.820
Best in the biz.

48:08.820 --> 48:10.660
No, best in the biz, the van.

48:10.660 --> 48:11.500
My van I have.

48:11.500 --> 48:12.340
That's enough comedy for a van.

48:12.340 --> 48:14.620
Mr. Matthews, I'm a ghost now

48:14.620 --> 48:16.660
and I'm having a very difficult time

48:16.660 --> 48:18.380
beating the Beauty and the Beast level

48:18.380 --> 48:19.620
in Kingdom Hearts 2.

48:19.620 --> 48:25.620
Mr. Matthews, I need you to help me beat the dark Mickey boss fight, please.

48:25.620 --> 48:28.620
Can I hear that noise one more time?

48:28.620 --> 48:30.620
Excellent.

48:30.620 --> 48:32.620
Great, great noise.

48:32.620 --> 48:33.620
That's my ring tone.

48:33.620 --> 48:34.620
That's the end of the show.

48:34.620 --> 48:37.620
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

49:06.620 --> 49:09.620

49:12.620 --> 49:14.620
and the specific venues there.

49:14.620 --> 49:17.620
Portland, that show is sold out.

49:17.620 --> 49:20.620
Sorry, but if you want, you can come see us in Seattle.

49:20.620 --> 49:22.620
There are still a bunch of tickets available for that one.

49:22.620 --> 49:24.620
If you're going to be in Seattle for PAX,

49:24.620 --> 49:26.620
you can come to the show,

49:26.620 --> 49:30.620
but you do not need a PAX badge to get into the M-B-M-B-A-M show.

49:30.620 --> 49:33.620
Those tickets are going fast and they're reserved seating.

49:33.620 --> 49:34.620
Yes.

49:34.620 --> 49:36.620
Do not wait. Do not hesitate.

49:36.620 --> 49:39.620
Go get those tickets.

49:39.620 --> 49:41.620
We haven't mentioned it in a while,

49:41.620 --> 49:43.620
but we've got PO boxes for the show

49:43.620 --> 49:46.620
an East Coast and a West Coast HQ.

49:46.620 --> 49:48.620
If there's anything you would like to send us,

49:48.620 --> 49:49.620
we get a lot of wedding invitations.

49:49.620 --> 49:51.620
That always makes us feel pretty special.

49:51.620 --> 49:54.620
Doesn't make you feel special though when we do not respond to them.

49:54.620 --> 49:56.620
We do not make it.

49:56.620 --> 50:01.620
The West Coast PO Box is PO Box 341769, 341769,

50:01.620 --> 50:04.620
Los Angeles, California 90034.

50:04.620 --> 50:09.620
PO Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia 2576.

50:09.620 --> 50:11.620
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

50:11.620 --> 50:12.620
for the use of our theme song,

50:12.620 --> 50:14.620
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

50:14.620 --> 50:18.620
You should definitely, definitely buy and listen to that album a lot

50:18.620 --> 50:20.620
because it's super-duper good.

50:20.620 --> 50:23.620
And best of luck, as always, to John Roderick

50:23.620 --> 50:25.620
on his Seattle City Council run.

50:25.620 --> 50:28.620
We are rooting for you, even if we can't vote for you

50:28.620 --> 50:31.620
because we don't live in Seattle.

50:31.620 --> 50:33.620
I might do an absentee ballot.

50:33.620 --> 50:35.620
I don't think that's how that works, Travis.

50:35.620 --> 50:36.620
Oh, bummer.

50:36.620 --> 50:39.620
There's new merch in the Max Fund Store,

50:39.620 --> 50:41.620
new Max Fund merch,

50:41.620 --> 50:44.620
including an incredibly awesome new Sol Bones shirt.

50:44.620 --> 50:47.620
So go check it out, maxfundstore.com.

50:47.620 --> 50:49.620
And we also have by Sydney's Sister Taylor.

50:49.620 --> 50:51.620
There's lots of My Brother, My Brother, Me merch there,

50:51.620 --> 50:53.620
other Max Fund merch.

50:53.620 --> 50:54.620
Go check it out.

50:54.620 --> 50:58.620
And please, if you can, share the show with a buddy,

50:58.620 --> 50:59.620
rate it, review it on iTunes.

50:59.620 --> 51:03.620
We don't spend any money advertising the show.

51:03.620 --> 51:04.620
We never have.

51:04.620 --> 51:07.620
We literally never have, so if you can help us out.

51:07.620 --> 51:08.620
And we never will.

51:08.620 --> 51:09.620
Well, I don't know about that.

51:09.620 --> 51:10.620
I'm on my fucking grind now.

51:10.620 --> 51:12.620
But if you can just help us out now

51:12.620 --> 51:16.620
when we're still in our five-year-long grassroots campaign

51:16.620 --> 51:18.620
by just telling a friend about the show

51:18.620 --> 51:20.620
and making them listen to an episode

51:20.620 --> 51:21.620
when they're in your car with you.

51:21.620 --> 51:22.620
If you listen to our show and you just realize that,

51:22.620 --> 51:24.620
hey, I've been listening to five years worth of this show

51:24.620 --> 51:26.620
and I've never reviewed it,

51:26.620 --> 51:30.620
we're at 2,996 reviews on iTunes.

51:30.620 --> 51:33.620
I want to make it into the big leagues, please.

51:33.620 --> 51:35.620
13 missed episodes in five years.

51:35.620 --> 51:37.620
Justin wants to be Mr. 3000 is what he's saying.

51:37.620 --> 51:39.620
Basically, yes.

51:39.620 --> 51:41.620
And, Watson, we get asked this a lot.

51:41.620 --> 51:43.620
If you would like to have a Jumbotron message,

51:43.620 --> 51:46.620
if you would like to wish someone a happy birthday

51:46.620 --> 51:49.620
or happy anniversary or just say,

51:49.620 --> 51:51.620
hey, I think you're great in the money zone,

51:51.620 --> 51:54.620
then just go to MaximumFun.org forward slash Jumbotron

51:54.620 --> 51:57.620
and you can set it all up there.

51:57.620 --> 52:01.620
We do a lot of them, so we can't guarantee a timeframe.

52:01.620 --> 52:03.620
It may be a delay.

52:03.620 --> 52:07.620
So non-time-specific, if you're willing to wait,

52:07.620 --> 52:09.620
it's a great way to tell someone you like them.

52:09.620 --> 52:11.620
And go listen to the other Max Fun shows.

52:11.620 --> 52:13.620
If you haven't, Jordan, Jesse, go.

52:13.620 --> 52:15.620
Stub Pockets and Yourself, Throwing Shade,

52:15.620 --> 52:17.620
Sawbones, The Adventure Zone, Bunker Buddies,

52:17.620 --> 52:19.620
we do those three.

52:19.620 --> 52:21.620
There are a ton of really great shows.

52:21.620 --> 52:23.620
Lady of the Lady, One Bad Mother, Pop Rocket.

52:23.620 --> 52:26.620
Just go to MaximumFun.org and poke around.

52:26.620 --> 52:27.620
Look around.

52:27.620 --> 52:29.620
There's a dropdown list of all the shows.

52:29.620 --> 52:31.620
You're going to like all of them.

52:31.620 --> 52:33.620
Oh, and a special plug here.

52:33.620 --> 52:35.620
A friend of the show, John Hodgman,

52:35.620 --> 52:37.620
is coming to our hometown.

52:37.620 --> 52:40.620
Well, not our hometown, but our home state,

52:40.620 --> 52:42.620
Charleston, West Virginia, live.

52:42.620 --> 52:43.620
What?

52:43.620 --> 52:44.620
In June.

52:44.620 --> 52:46.620
Yes, this is happening.

52:46.620 --> 52:48.620
So just search for John Hodgman Charleston

52:48.620 --> 52:49.620
and you'll see tickets.

52:49.620 --> 52:52.620
I'm going to be there and I'm going to try to con my way

52:52.620 --> 52:54.620
on the stage to get my...

52:54.620 --> 52:56.620
I just want applause.

52:56.620 --> 52:58.620
I don't really want to do anything for it.

52:58.620 --> 53:00.620
But tickets are very reasonable, 30 bucks.

53:00.620 --> 53:03.620
It's part of Festival June 22nd in Charleston.

53:03.620 --> 53:05.620
So go see our buddy John Hodgman.

53:05.620 --> 53:06.620
With me.

53:06.620 --> 53:08.620
Y'all ready for that final?

53:08.620 --> 53:09.620
You know it.

53:09.620 --> 53:10.620
Yeah.

53:10.620 --> 53:12.620
Y'all ready for my new mixtape?

53:12.620 --> 53:15.620
This final mixtape is fire.

53:15.620 --> 53:17.620
And it was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

53:17.620 --> 53:18.620
Thank you, Zoe.

53:18.620 --> 53:20.620
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

53:20.620 --> 53:21.620
No name.

53:21.620 --> 53:23.620
No name available.

53:23.620 --> 53:24.620
Doug.

53:24.620 --> 53:28.620
Doug Yahoo.

53:28.620 --> 53:30.620
It's asked by Doug Yahoo.

53:30.620 --> 53:32.620
Doug Yahoo asks...

53:32.620 --> 53:37.620
Why does the footballist Steve Madden

53:37.620 --> 53:40.620
now make fashion shoes?

53:40.620 --> 53:43.620
I'm Justin McElroy.

53:43.620 --> 53:45.620
I'm Travis McElroy.

53:45.620 --> 53:47.620
I'm footballist Steve Madden.

53:47.620 --> 53:49.620
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

53:49.620 --> 54:08.620
Get your dad's score out of the lips.

54:08.620 --> 54:10.620
Maximumfun.org.

54:10.620 --> 54:11.620
Comedy and culture.

54:11.620 --> 54:12.620
Artist owned.

54:12.620 --> 54:13.620
Listener supported.

54:13.620 --> 54:16.620
Hello, I'm Taco, the elephant magician.

54:16.620 --> 54:20.620
World High Church here, the master of clerical magic.

54:20.620 --> 54:22.620
I'm Magnus Burnside, the fighter.

54:22.620 --> 54:24.620
Did you guys like that?

54:24.620 --> 54:26.620
Did you, the listener, like that?

54:26.620 --> 54:29.620
You were just swept up in a world of high fantasy and magic

54:29.620 --> 54:31.620
where anything can happen and anything is possible.

54:31.620 --> 54:34.620
Hi, I'm Griffin McElroy, dungeon master for The Adventure Zone,

54:34.620 --> 54:38.620
a new podcast on Maximumfun in which magic and mystery intertwine

54:38.620 --> 54:42.620
for a very erotically charged role-playing experience.

54:42.620 --> 54:45.620
You can catch it every other Thursday here on Maximumfun.org or iTunes.

54:45.620 --> 54:48.620
It's for Dungeons and Dragons, but with family.
