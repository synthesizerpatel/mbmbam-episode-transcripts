00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.680
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

00:47.680 --> 00:51.360
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:51.360 --> 00:55.600
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:55.600 --> 01:00.560
Well, it's happened again. What has?

01:01.680 --> 01:04.960
It's November, and that means it's time for music reviews.

01:05.600 --> 01:10.560
Oh yeah. Oh man, it's always my favorite time of year when November music reviews time rolls

01:10.560 --> 01:14.800
around. I feel like we never get to talk about music the rest of the year. It's always so nice

01:14.800 --> 01:20.160
to hit, I think, what is it? I think it's the third Monday or the second Monday of the most musical

01:20.160 --> 01:23.360
month of the year. Yeah, so I'd like to start out by talking about a new album that's very important

01:23.360 --> 01:34.960
to me. It's the new opus from Jimmy Eat World. Whoa, what do you got? And it's called We Ate It

01:34.960 --> 01:41.200
All Up. Dinner's Done. We Done Ate the World. And so I'd like to go sort of track by track,

01:41.200 --> 01:46.240
because these boys, these Jimmies are really wearing their hats and hearts right on their

01:46.240 --> 01:54.240
sleeve with this one. A lot of their pathos is present in a lot of the tracks, and you really

01:55.520 --> 02:02.000
feel like in the first track, which is called, really, seriously, we're going to eat the whole

02:02.000 --> 02:08.400
world like Galactus did, they have a lyric in the chorus that's like, yum, yum, eat it up, whole

02:08.400 --> 02:14.240
planet, yum. And when I hear that, I just think like, yeah, that's today. That is today.

02:14.240 --> 02:20.640
I've got an album that I'm really actually very excited about, and it's a new one. Guess who's

02:20.640 --> 02:27.760
back? It's Sting. Sting is here. Sting's here, everyone. Hey, everyone. Sting's back.

02:28.640 --> 02:35.120
I've been hoping to hear about this album and your sort of skewed perspective on it here in

02:35.120 --> 02:40.240
Music November. So I'm hoping that you can sort of give me, just like break me off a little piece

02:40.240 --> 02:45.920
of that Kit Kat bar. Well, I hope that you're not like expecting some hard criticism because I am

02:45.920 --> 02:52.160
so excited about 57th and 9th, named after, of course, the intersection he crossed on his way

02:52.160 --> 03:00.320
to the studio where he recorded it. Wow, really grass and straws there. Gordon just looked outside

03:00.320 --> 03:06.080
and said where he was, and this was the record he made. So what sort of melodic delights does Gordon

03:06.080 --> 03:14.080
have for us this time, Justin? Well, Gordon has been away from pop rock music for 13 years since

03:14.080 --> 03:24.640
his 2003 album Sacred Love, but he's back after 13 years with a big disc of 10 songs. So if you're

03:24.640 --> 03:31.600
wondering, it's a big, it's like physically large. No, it's just a 10 big hits that took him 13. So

03:31.600 --> 03:39.840
if you're wondering the rate at which Gordon Sumner comes up with good songs, it is 0.75 songs

03:39.840 --> 03:46.480
per year because it took him 13 years and he's back with 10 songs. He's got everybody on this one.

03:46.480 --> 03:56.400
Garth, Madonna, Tony Bennett, just everybody's on this one. And everybody likes to make jokes about

03:56.400 --> 04:02.240
his dick and how it takes him a long time to nut. But I think that maybe this man just like

04:02.800 --> 04:10.560
is sort of, has like a sloth brain in there. Well, he might just be moving on like a different

04:10.560 --> 04:17.920
time scale than the rest of us. He will live to be 300, but his 300 years will be the same as

04:17.920 --> 04:24.160
100 human years. Travis, what sort of melodic delights do you have for us? And also I'm gonna

04:24.160 --> 04:30.080
black ball fallout boy. I'm gonna- That's fair. That's fair. Veto power. That's fair, Griffin.

04:30.080 --> 04:39.040
Well, I'm very excited because for the first time ever, there's a six LP set. It's a career spanning

04:39.040 --> 04:46.960
vinyl box set that encompasses the entirety of the Evanescence studio albums. They're all available

04:46.960 --> 04:54.960
now. Fallen, The Open Door, Evanescence, and those last two, according to the Evanescence website,

04:54.960 --> 05:01.920
are making their vinyl debut. And for the first time ever, the commercial debut for the previously

05:01.920 --> 05:08.240
unreleased demo album, Origin. KevinEssence is the- KevinEssence. That was the original name

05:08.240 --> 05:16.720
of the band. And it was this man named Kevin and his essence. It was sort of a book

05:16.720 --> 05:23.360
report on a man named Kevin, but then things got kind of dark. And it also features the first

05:23.360 --> 05:28.960
new Evanescence studio recording in years, even in death, recorded in 2016.

05:29.760 --> 05:36.720
Dad, you're still at it. RIP Evanescence. RIP KevinEssence. Devoted musicians, thank you for your

05:37.680 --> 05:44.640
sacrifice. Yeah, that's what- Leslie Odom Jr. Hey! Here's good news. He's got a Christmas record

05:44.640 --> 05:49.360
out called Simply Christmas. That sounds like- That's amazing to hear. Fucking good, doesn't it?

05:49.360 --> 05:55.040
Oh, he should have called it Odom Are You Faithful. Odom Are You Faithful would have been a very good

05:55.040 --> 06:02.400
name. It would have been a great name. It would have been a very good name. But- I'm very tired.

06:02.400 --> 06:06.480
You know what would have been a great name for Gordon's new- Oh, Travis, I'm so fucking tired.

06:07.040 --> 06:13.920
Fucking tired. So tired. Fucking tired. Fuck. You know what would have been a good name for-

06:13.920 --> 06:18.960
You know what would have been a great name for Gordon's album? What? Fucking anything else, Gordon.

06:20.960 --> 06:25.680
Maybe Gordon's tired too. I'm so excited.

06:27.920 --> 06:34.480
And Slaybells is back. Slaybells, fuck, what'd you name it? Slaybells is back, but it's not a

06:34.480 --> 06:39.520
Christmas album called Jingle Bells, because that would be a very good name for a Christmas record

06:39.520 --> 06:45.520
from Slaybells. No, it's called Jessica Rabbit, and I'm sure it's very good. I like Slaybells.

06:45.520 --> 06:52.720
Pink Floyd's back with a record from 1967. It's the early years of Pink Floyd. Oh man,

06:52.720 --> 07:02.480
we've had a lot of music. Let's- Can we just head down, ass up, do these fucking advice questions?

07:02.480 --> 07:09.600
Yeah, of course. You know, the Hold Steady just re-released some albums of bonus tracks.

07:09.600 --> 07:13.680
Got to pick up those- Separation Sunday and Almost Killed Me. Those are out. Love them.

07:13.680 --> 07:20.080
Give them- Fork them over. Okay. If you don't want to hear about any- Trish and Garth are back

07:20.080 --> 07:24.080
with a Christmas record, by the way. If you want to get that in Leslie's record and just play them

07:24.080 --> 07:28.880
at the same time and just have a really good- They sync up. They sync up perfectly. It sounds

07:28.880 --> 07:33.840
like a trio. A triad. Yeah. I mean, yeah, originally that was sort of the arrangement

07:33.840 --> 07:40.240
as they were doing all these beautiful three-part harmonies, but there was beef. And so, you know,

07:40.240 --> 07:43.840
you know how it goes. You know how sometimes they take harmony albums and they split it up

07:44.800 --> 07:48.960
and they release them in separate. Please, I'm so tired. Can we please get to the first advice?

07:48.960 --> 07:53.600
Of course we can get to the first advice. Deep Blue Something's back. I knew it, you son of a bitch.

07:53.600 --> 07:57.040
You are literally killing me in hell. At Denny's for their shift.

07:57.040 --> 08:06.320
No, no, I'm sure that they're still killing it. I'd go see Deep Blue Something. They're not

08:06.320 --> 08:11.040
together. I'm sorry, I'm such an idiot. Please, please, please set me free. Is there anybody

08:11.040 --> 08:16.560
else you want me to check on real quick? Please, please set me free from this genie's curse.

08:16.560 --> 08:22.000
Please, God, start reading another question. Let Griffin become Jen. I'm sorry about Deep

08:22.000 --> 08:25.760
Blue Something if you're listening, by the way. You seem like swell guys. I'm just kidding.

08:25.760 --> 08:30.640
My wife and I recently moved into a new house. This week I came home. I've done it. I've ascended.

08:34.960 --> 08:41.120
Our neighbors had left us a gift on our front porch. It was the new Christmas album.

08:43.040 --> 08:46.640
Oh no, I'm not Jen anymore. I'm back in the back of the lamp. Damn it.

08:48.480 --> 08:54.480
Robbie Williams is back and Robbie Robertson is actually back also. And it seems like they could

08:54.480 --> 08:58.640
have worked that out better because that's going to cause some market confusion, I worry.

09:00.400 --> 09:04.560
But no, they left a gift and it's not unusual in their neighborhood because they've previously

09:04.560 --> 09:10.240
relieved, received potted plants, loaves of bread, bags of apples. No, no, no. Thank you.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.600
No, sorry. What?

09:11.600 --> 09:17.120
Thank you for the chore and the mold and the rot. I really appreciate all this in my trashcan.

09:17.120 --> 09:22.160
However, this week's gift was slightly more different. We received a book. Specifically,

09:22.160 --> 09:28.480
we received come a sutra, a classic love making techniques reinterpreted.

09:29.920 --> 09:34.560
Travis, there, there was an attached photo. Did you check there? Just trust me.

09:34.560 --> 09:40.800
I trust you. I don't need to see their dirty book. My question is twofold. One, how the fuck do I

09:40.800 --> 09:46.560
face my neighbors after they've given us such a thing? And two, what do I say if they asked me

09:46.560 --> 09:53.680
if we got their gift? That's a clever location based name. I'll answer the second one first.

09:53.680 --> 09:57.920
You say, oh yeah, we got it. And then there's a wink a bunch till they leave.

09:57.920 --> 10:00.240
We've got it all night long.

10:00.240 --> 10:05.120
Make a ring with your finger and then with your fingers in your left hand and then make a second

10:05.760 --> 10:10.880
very skewed ring with your pinky and ring finger on your left hand. And then put like two of your

10:10.880 --> 10:15.520
fingers or your right hand into them in and out, in and out, in and out in like different ways

10:15.520 --> 10:21.760
until they leave you alone forever. This won't happen, right? You got my fuck,

10:23.520 --> 10:30.720
like strategy guide, right? You got my pro strat no scope fuck guide, right?

10:30.720 --> 10:37.920
Yeah. You got my game facts to vagina. You got my fuck tome, didn't you? It was the one

10:37.920 --> 10:43.040
my fucker and Omicron. I got you the fucker and Omicron. You're supposed to open it and just like

10:43.040 --> 10:46.960
let it free the fuck within you, the undead fuck all around.

10:47.920 --> 10:54.000
You got my, you got my prima game strategy guide to letting that hog go wild, right? You got that?

10:54.000 --> 10:59.200
Yes. Good. Excellent. It shows you where to find all the secret collectibles in there.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.960
You got my chick track about dick tracks, right? Right.

11:04.960 --> 11:08.000
So I don't think this is going to, I don't think somebody's ever going to come up to you and be

11:08.000 --> 11:13.680
like, you got that dick book, right? Good, good. Well, there's two. Okay. There's two things though.

11:14.320 --> 11:21.680
It's one of two scenarios. Either the one who gave you this is like the weird beard who's,

11:21.680 --> 11:26.320
you know, that's not fair. Maybe they're just a little too open. It's the person who's a little

11:26.320 --> 11:31.920
too open with all the neighbors and like everyone's like, yeah, that's Gary. That's who Gary is.

11:31.920 --> 11:36.640
Or it's somebody who thought this would be really funny.

11:36.640 --> 11:43.600
Yeah. So fun. It's and like, let's be honest, it's hysterical. It's pretty good.

11:44.160 --> 11:49.200
Your reaction to it is making it even better. Here's where I'm at. I also think the act of

11:49.200 --> 11:54.640
leaving a bag, a big old bag full of apples on somebody's front doorstep is also pretty funny.

11:55.200 --> 12:00.560
I use the apples. Here's the apples. Here are the apples. Now they're your apples.

12:00.560 --> 12:04.480
These are your apples now. Now you're the apple man. Now you have all the apples.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.880
What are you going to do with this power?

12:08.640 --> 12:12.400
Bread and a potted plant I get. Like I bake this bread. Enjoy it. This is like,

12:12.400 --> 12:16.560
I went to the store and I saw a bag of apples and I was like, this is Trisha all over.

12:17.200 --> 12:21.520
But the thing about it is there's an inherent weirdness though to just leaving on the porch

12:21.520 --> 12:26.080
versus knocking on the door and handing it to them. Like that's a welcome to the neighborhood.

12:26.080 --> 12:30.720
Now we've had a face-to-face conversation as neighbors versus like this sneaky,

12:30.720 --> 12:36.320
like thief in the night gift giving process that makes it inherently weird.

12:37.200 --> 12:42.400
I'm trying, I just like went on a visual journey in my head trying to imagine coming home after a

12:42.400 --> 12:50.640
long day at going to the BP to get beer and coming back and finding a bag of apples on my doorstep

12:50.640 --> 12:58.640
and just thinking about the procedure. Now you want me to eat them with my mouth? Like if I,

12:58.640 --> 13:04.880
listen, if I buy a bag of apples at the store, that is symbolic of a new commitment I've made

13:04.880 --> 13:10.560
to wellness. You cannot force this on me. Like you can't force this lifestyle.

13:10.560 --> 13:14.720
I would feel like I was in like a nineties movie about the fear of surveillance.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.800
I just like spin around staring into the bushes and trees, screaming, who did this?

13:18.800 --> 13:19.040
Yeah.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.560
Who did this to me?

13:20.560 --> 13:27.600
Now I do want to point out so dark the con of man that we are so distracted by this apple bag

13:27.600 --> 13:35.040
that we are not considering the boner, the boner guide that they, that this person really did

13:35.040 --> 13:40.400
receive and how to, how to struggle with that reality that they find themselves in.

13:40.400 --> 13:44.960
I think, I feel like, I feel like a good, I think you could like cut out a lot of the

13:45.440 --> 13:50.080
potential conversations that may happen about this book by letting the neighborhood

13:50.800 --> 13:54.480
know that you got it. If you know what I'm saying, I'm saying-

13:54.480 --> 13:56.960
What Xeroxes? Like pictures around a yard sign?

13:56.960 --> 14:00.560
No, no, no. I'm saying you open up those windows.

14:00.560 --> 14:00.960
Uh oh.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.080
And you just let-

14:02.080 --> 14:04.560
And you open up a webcam site.

14:04.560 --> 14:10.320
No, no, no, no, no. Just open up those windows and let the, just the stink lines come out.

14:10.320 --> 14:14.080
Hell yeah. You open up the windows and when your neighbor walks past, you're just like,

14:14.080 --> 14:17.280
hey, remember that book you got me? I adapted it into a movie.

14:17.280 --> 14:17.760
Yeah.

14:17.760 --> 14:18.960
And then just go for it.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.800
And then just let them feel the reek of it, you know?

14:22.800 --> 14:27.120
Yeah. I adapted it into a stage play. This is a live theater happening.

14:28.000 --> 14:28.800
Do you guys want a yahoo?

14:29.440 --> 14:30.080
Yeah, please.

14:31.280 --> 14:34.000
I got a lot of good ones this week. Thank you all very, very much.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.120
I want to make clear out all of that. We're not kink shaming anyone who uses-

14:37.120 --> 14:39.600
No, not yuck, yuck, yuck. It's just like a weird-

14:39.600 --> 14:44.080
It's just presumptuous or funny. It's either presumptuous or very funny.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.200
I think it's very funny.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.000
I think it's very funny. I might think it's very funny.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.280
It is also representative of like how weird we are about sex.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.760
It's just like that's a very personal-

14:53.760 --> 14:58.400
If it's not funny, it's a very personal thing to suppose.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.400
I don't know. That's a weird-

15:01.840 --> 15:03.280
No, sorry.

15:03.920 --> 15:07.120
Listen, we're the most accepting people you'll meet on the face of the earth,

15:07.760 --> 15:11.600
but there's still social norms that we have to try to cling to, I think.

15:12.560 --> 15:15.360
Please don't leave a fuck by numbers on my front porch.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.880
Don't get funny and mail us one. Fuck you.

15:18.880 --> 15:19.200
Nope.

15:19.200 --> 15:19.920
I'm cutting it off now.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.240
It's already done. It's already done. We already have them. We have six.

15:22.240 --> 15:25.920
We have seven. We have 12 now between the three of us. That's fine.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.000
We'll donate them to Goodwill. Don't worry.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.280
Nope. Hey, I'll fucking use it.

15:33.120 --> 15:36.160
Brooks Oglesby sent this in. Thank you, Brooks. It's by Yahoo Answers user.

15:36.720 --> 15:40.400
Please load. Please Yahoo. Please Yahoo. Please Yahoo.

15:40.400 --> 15:44.480
Please Yahoo. I already lost Vine. I cannot lose you as well.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.000
This morning I was on the John, loaded up the Vines.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.760
They won't load. I think that's it.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.440
Are you kidding me? We're done.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.320
Time of death. Kevin Essence asks,

15:56.320 --> 16:00.160
how can you cheat at laser tag?

16:02.160 --> 16:04.640
I am going to play laser tag sometime, I guess.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.280
They've made their beats with it.

16:09.280 --> 16:14.720
I need to know how to cheat so that I don't lose and so I can beat some little losers.

16:14.720 --> 16:19.280
Any ideas for cheating would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, bros.

16:19.280 --> 16:23.760
Just off the top of your dome, how old is this question asker?

16:23.760 --> 16:25.360
Like 26 years old.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.040
Cool. Right there with you.

16:28.480 --> 16:31.520
How do you fucking cheat at laser tag?

16:31.520 --> 16:35.360
Hand across the vest, next question.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.200
Yeah. Hand across the vest.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.880
This sensor could be in the gun, though.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.920
You know, there's like, and also it's like infrared beams,

16:41.920 --> 16:45.120
which I think can penetrate Travis Fletch.

16:45.840 --> 16:48.880
You're going to need a lead skin suit.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.040
Now that's, now we're talking.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.240
Now we're talking.

16:52.240 --> 16:57.200
If you go in there with a bulletproof vest over the laser tag vest, then you might be okay.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.360
It's not cheating.

16:59.360 --> 17:03.360
Putting the arm across the vest isn't going to guarantee a win.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.800
It just gives you an edge.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.440
What's your laser tag edge, Griffin?

17:07.440 --> 17:11.440
Because there's also just like blind firing where you just like pin yourself behind a wall

17:11.440 --> 17:15.360
and like you lean out so like there's no sensor visible and you're just fighting.

17:15.360 --> 17:21.680
But I do want to say if there was a gunfight happening and I was in this gunfight

17:21.680 --> 17:25.280
and I just like poked my arm out around the corner and blind fired,

17:25.280 --> 17:27.680
I don't think the person I was in the gunfight with would be like,

17:27.680 --> 17:29.600
Hey, that's cheating, sir.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.480
That's a, you know, Griffin, you're, it's an excellent point.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.640
Why are you, why, we shouldn't call it cheating.

17:34.640 --> 17:35.840
This is laser war.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.520
You know what I mean?

17:37.520 --> 17:45.120
If I put a guard over my sensor, I think that we are enders gaming our children here

17:45.120 --> 17:47.120
and teaching them laser war.

17:47.120 --> 17:47.360
Yeah.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.400
I mean, yeah, that's the only war of the future.

17:50.400 --> 17:50.640
Sure.

17:50.640 --> 17:51.600
Yeah, laser war.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.400
We're training an entire generation for laser war.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.080
I guess, yeah, it's hard, right?

17:56.080 --> 17:58.160
Cause this is like a physical folk game.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.120
It's hard to like, you can't really like plug a game genie into your vest.

18:01.120 --> 18:08.480
Um, so in terms of like cheating this physical thing, I think the right answer is like

18:10.000 --> 18:12.880
steroids, human growth hormones, things like that.

18:12.880 --> 18:16.400
I was going to say training, but yours is way easier.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.480
Well, training, oh God, Travis, training's not cheating.

18:19.280 --> 18:25.600
I feel though, if you, okay, I kind of think that if you play laser tag to get better at it

18:25.600 --> 18:27.600
for like an event you have coming up,

18:27.600 --> 18:31.520
that's such a weird thing to do that it almost is cheating.

18:31.520 --> 18:36.320
Like that's basically everyone should be going in with the same level of incompetence,

18:36.320 --> 18:40.800
I think, except for the assumption that I think everybody who has played any amount

18:40.800 --> 18:41.920
of video games makes it.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.560
Like when I get in there, I'm going to fucking savage them.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.200
No, you're not.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.560
I've been training for this, you're not.

18:46.560 --> 18:51.680
You're going to get so tired, so fast from running around so much and hiding and trying

18:51.680 --> 18:54.560
to do these fucking like metal gear, solid dives.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.200
You're going to dive.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.920
You're going to land right on your keys and that's it.

18:57.920 --> 19:03.760
You're going to get savage by these like little 12 year olds who have a tenacity and ferocity

19:03.760 --> 19:08.880
that has been forever lost to you, a 36 year old man.

19:08.880 --> 19:14.400
Laser tag falls under this category of things like bowling and darts for me, which is like

19:14.400 --> 19:18.800
if any significant amount of time has passed between the last time I attempted them,

19:18.800 --> 19:24.880
it's very easy for me to convince myself that I think I'm pretty good at it until I try again

19:24.880 --> 19:28.320
and I'm like, oh no, wait, I'm done with this.

19:28.320 --> 19:34.480
That is why I'm going to just jam this needle right into that buttock and I'm going to get

19:34.480 --> 19:36.400
you huge and crazy in there.

19:37.040 --> 19:40.640
Everybody else is going to roll up and they're going to be on a fairly even playing field,

19:40.640 --> 19:43.840
which is that they're going to get very tired very fast unless they're young children,

19:44.400 --> 19:48.240
except for you with your huge, crazy, big body.

19:48.240 --> 19:56.480
And you are going to be indefatigable, you will not be able to be fatigued, you will

19:56.480 --> 20:02.400
be able to jump super, super high and just rain lasers down upon all these tweens and

20:02.400 --> 20:03.200
stuff because your body's going to be-

20:03.200 --> 20:03.840
But for how long?

20:03.840 --> 20:05.760
How long will this treatment last, Griffin?

20:06.560 --> 20:09.280
I mean, it depends on the strain, right?

20:09.280 --> 20:16.000
Like I've got that Michael's secret stuff that I jam every time I'm about to go tagging and it

20:16.000 --> 20:21.440
makes me big and crazy and it really gives me a lot of, not only mass that I can use

20:21.440 --> 20:28.480
to be big and strong, but it also just makes me really, just really crazy aggressive.

20:28.480 --> 20:31.280
Like very, very, very, very aggressive.

20:31.280 --> 20:36.240
It shuts down whatever inhibitors I have that keep me from getting crazy in there.

20:37.840 --> 20:41.680
Hey, here's one that might be cheating that people would never do is hostages.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.720
That's one that you never see people do that.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.320
Just like grab that 12 year old.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.160
You still got body mass on him.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.720
Grab that 12 year old and just use him as a human shield.

20:50.720 --> 20:54.160
Like his team's going to be terrified to take the shot.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.760
They won't be able to take the shot.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.680
And if they shoot in the head, it does nothing.

20:57.680 --> 21:01.120
So shoot through me, shoot through me.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.400
You have to take him out.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.480
Skyler, Skyler, it's okay.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.240
We always knew this would happen.

21:07.280 --> 21:08.560
This is always a possibility.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.360
We trained for this.

21:09.360 --> 21:19.120
There is, that does break one rule, which is to say legal laws, federal legal laws.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.160
Like it may not break laser tag rules.

21:22.160 --> 21:26.880
I don't think Billy Bob's is going to have like a don't grab and use kids as human shields,

21:26.880 --> 21:30.320
but I'm pretty sure that is in like the constitution somewhere.

21:30.880 --> 21:34.320
So, so like, but it is cheating, but that's cheating, Griffin.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.880
Like if you don't break rules, it's not cheating.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.560
If I could rob a bank and I get caught and be like, I'm just cheating.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.400
Take it up with the ref.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.920
It's just, it's a game shark.

21:45.920 --> 21:46.560
Chill, dude.

21:48.800 --> 21:49.760
Well, okay.

21:49.760 --> 21:50.560
But they do.

21:51.360 --> 21:51.600
Okay.

21:52.560 --> 21:56.160
Laws are different on a football field.

21:57.120 --> 21:57.600
Do those.

21:57.600 --> 22:01.440
Cause like if you did football things to people in real life, you go to prison.

22:02.640 --> 22:03.760
That used to be the case.

22:03.760 --> 22:04.560
I don't know.

22:04.560 --> 22:08.080
But you, if you do football things to people in real life, you go to prison.

22:08.720 --> 22:13.200
I don't, I don't know if that applies in laser tech.

22:13.200 --> 22:18.000
Like I want to be a fly on the wall for that manager conversation with the Billy Bob's.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.240
Hey, listen, guys, I don't want to, I don't want anybody to take advantage of this.

22:23.600 --> 22:29.600
But I do want to let you all know that when you're in there, it's basically international waters.

22:29.600 --> 22:33.040
Think of it as like the laser tag embassy.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.880
There's really no laws in there.

22:34.880 --> 22:39.280
So if you guys are going to go smoke your pot, please do it in the laser tag arena,

22:39.280 --> 22:41.120
where it is 100% legal.

22:41.120 --> 22:46.080
You'll see in the one quarter, I do have a fairly robust grow operation,

22:46.080 --> 22:50.560
but John law can't touch me because it is in a laser tag arena.

22:50.560 --> 22:51.060
Yeah.

22:51.920 --> 22:57.520
And also when you, when you in the, in a laser tag arena, the manager can marry you.

22:58.320 --> 23:02.400
If you were on a football team, a professional football team, and it was Sunday,

23:02.400 --> 23:04.160
you're geared up for the big game.

23:04.160 --> 23:08.400
If you sat down and stole somebody's identity from the opposing team,

23:08.400 --> 23:10.160
would they be able to stop you?

23:10.160 --> 23:10.720
Like, could they?

23:10.720 --> 23:14.000
Well, you'd have to do it on the field with like your iPad and your hand running.

23:14.000 --> 23:14.800
That's what I'm saying.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.360
Like as the play is going on, you're stealing his identity.

23:17.360 --> 23:21.840
Like as you run past him, you're like, Hey, look at me now.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.640
I'm Chad OchoCinco.

23:24.640 --> 23:25.040
Sorry.

23:25.040 --> 23:30.000
I don't have a lot of football players on of the current age at my fingertips.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.400
Um, I think that would be legal.

23:33.040 --> 23:38.560
Um, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.400
This just came in hot, hot off the press.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.040
It's hot.

23:41.040 --> 23:41.360
Whoa.

23:41.360 --> 23:43.520
This one is, is, is burning my hands here.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.120
It's a, I got a haunted doll watch.

23:45.840 --> 23:46.480
Oh, good.

23:47.680 --> 23:48.480
Good news, guys.

23:48.480 --> 23:53.360
I've been combing eBay for some of the latest and greatest and haunted doll, uh, advances.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.760
And I got for you a real treat today.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.000
It's a haunted doll named Samantha.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.080
Um, and spooky name.

24:01.200 --> 24:07.200
She was as all haunted dolls must legally be found after the seller's grandma passed away.

24:07.200 --> 24:10.720
Um, they're having that's what, that's what keeps this economy afloat.

24:10.720 --> 24:13.280
It's always just making more ghosts.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.720
Just making more ghosts.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.200
There's not a lot of haunted doll stories to start with.

24:17.200 --> 24:23.920
So I was walking through the Kmart and there on the shelf was a Barbie was a Barbie.

24:23.920 --> 24:24.720
It was weird.

24:24.720 --> 24:27.680
It was weird. My grandma was a kind, loving spirit.

24:27.680 --> 24:31.680
And my aunt Angelica was a healer and a psychic in her country.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.440
I guess they crossed the boundaries.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.800
We're like, well, I've lost it.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.320
I was taken care of by my aunt.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.560
So I learned how to perceive and work with energy.

24:40.560 --> 24:44.560
So they're just like, yeah, they're just establishing their bonus fee days, uh,

24:45.280 --> 24:49.760
using different forms of communication, such as a pendulum and automatic writing in order

24:49.760 --> 24:52.080
to give my buyers as much information as I can about my spirit.

24:52.080 --> 24:52.400
Okay.

24:52.400 --> 24:52.720
We try it.

24:52.720 --> 24:53.680
We trust you.

24:53.680 --> 24:54.320
We trust you.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.440
This doll's name is Samantha.

24:56.080 --> 25:02.320
Porcelain head, arms and legs, 16 inches tall, blonde wavy hair, Victorian attire.

25:03.120 --> 25:07.840
It plays music, which is just, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't believe that.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.000
So here's the thing about Samantha.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.200
That's real fun.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.280
She's an angel of healing.

25:13.280 --> 25:15.840
Well, hold on, hold on.

25:15.840 --> 25:19.040
She has the ability to heal those that are in need.

25:19.040 --> 25:25.440
She uses her eyes to transmit healing energy and with a beam of white ethereal light,

25:25.760 --> 25:29.040
she can be asked to heal a particular part of the body.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.520
Her gaze is very intense.

25:31.520 --> 25:35.680
You can almost feel her scanning your entire being with her eyes.

25:35.680 --> 25:36.320
Okay.

25:36.320 --> 25:38.080
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

25:38.080 --> 25:38.400
Yeah.

25:38.400 --> 25:45.840
Oftentimes in a Hanado watch, the seller will say things like having them around affects

25:45.840 --> 25:52.640
your luck or like their very presence will make you upset or something.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.680
Will move energy orbs while you're not looking.

25:55.680 --> 26:02.640
The idea of saying her eyes emit a white beam of light is a pretty testable claim.

26:02.640 --> 26:03.360
What do you got?

26:03.360 --> 26:03.840
Goiters?

26:07.840 --> 26:13.680
One thing though is this seller has 210 transactions with 100% positive feedback.

26:13.680 --> 26:13.920
Yeah.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.680
My goiters are gone.

26:15.680 --> 26:16.560
I don't know what to say.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.000
My goiters are gone.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.640
Bought the doll, goiters up and left, moved out.

26:21.680 --> 26:25.840
So when you wind her up and you listen to her melody, you gaze in her eyes and you can

26:25.840 --> 26:27.920
feel a warmth think of your being.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.400
This is the time that you focus on the healing that you need.

26:30.400 --> 26:35.200
And the shingles just fall right off and they're gone.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.560
Thank you, angel doll.

26:36.560 --> 26:40.080
100% satisfaction.

26:41.040 --> 26:41.520
Excellent.

26:41.520 --> 26:46.080
Just what I just what I needed to answer your two biggest questions.

26:46.080 --> 26:49.920
Yes, this person is selling their magic doll that heals people.

26:49.920 --> 26:52.240
And they're doing it for a starting bid of $55.

26:53.200 --> 26:59.680
So yeah, which seems like a kind of a steal for a magic doll that heals you with eye beams.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.320
Yeah, my really want to buy a triple a video game.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.760
My goiter medicine $70.

27:04.480 --> 27:07.120
So this is this is an excellent bargain.

27:07.120 --> 27:12.160
And their last line is eBay forbids the sale of inanimate objects.

27:12.160 --> 27:16.080
Therefore, this is being sold as a doll and for entertainment purposes.

27:16.080 --> 27:17.040
They do not.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.360
They do not ban the sale of inanimate objects.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.960
No, I don't think you know.

27:20.960 --> 27:26.480
I don't know what you think inanimate means, but it's not that it's not ghosts.

27:26.480 --> 27:32.480
I recently bought an SNES cartridge of Chrono Trigger and it doesn't up and fucking move.

27:33.680 --> 27:34.800
But if it did.

27:34.800 --> 27:38.320
But if it did, but if it did, can I say something?

27:38.320 --> 27:42.560
I have a thing that I want to sell on eBay.

27:43.600 --> 27:46.880
I have an Oculus Rift that I want to sell on eBay.

27:46.880 --> 27:54.080
And I feel like this this program has delegitimized the platform to the point where I wonder if

27:54.080 --> 27:55.760
that's even a good idea.

27:55.760 --> 28:02.160
Well, you can't sell it unless it like does it sprout legs and unless it can like banish

28:02.160 --> 28:10.640
your dark thoughts, then I don't think unless like my my, you know, great great aunt died

28:10.640 --> 28:13.520
and inhabited the virtual reality headset.

28:13.520 --> 28:20.160
And now every time I try to play, you know, some sort of fun fun 3D space shooter, my

28:20.160 --> 28:23.920
my great great aunt appears and is like, let me get that dark energy out of you.

28:25.040 --> 28:27.440
I don't think it's applicable for the platform.

28:30.240 --> 28:30.960
Correct.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.360
Where does the music come from from the porcelain doll?

28:35.360 --> 28:36.320
Right wind up.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.600
Yeah, you wind it up and the music to start and the healing energy.

28:41.760 --> 28:42.480
She's Bluetooth.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.000
You just connected to your phone.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.240
Do you think it even does play music?

28:46.240 --> 28:50.640
Like if they're willing to say it shoots healing being like, is that what you're going

28:50.640 --> 28:51.600
to be upset about?

28:51.600 --> 28:54.720
Like this music doesn't work like the healing though.

28:54.720 --> 28:55.760
Top notch 100%.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.040
But like I couldn't get the music to play.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.320
I mean, that is a great question.

29:00.320 --> 29:03.920
Justin, there's a lie on the description.

29:03.920 --> 29:09.120
So am I going to get this thing and it's actually wood, not porcelain, like painted

29:09.120 --> 29:11.280
wood like, oh, this sucks.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.240
Contact the seller.

29:12.240 --> 29:13.120
Hey, this is painted wood.

29:13.120 --> 29:13.840
This isn't porcelain.

29:13.840 --> 29:14.720
Like, yeah, dude.

29:14.720 --> 29:15.680
All that was lies.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.720
I said it was a healing angel.

29:18.720 --> 29:21.040
You should have known that everything I say is bunk.

29:24.000 --> 29:29.440
Yeah, it's and it's wild, by the way, that people can run all this fucking game.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.760
And then at the very end be like psych.

29:32.320 --> 29:33.760
eBay says I have to say psych.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.880
So psych like, oh, well, why did I?

29:37.440 --> 29:39.040
You should have put that first.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.200
Also, I will say bullshit.

29:41.200 --> 29:45.680
It seems like a weird skirting to be like, and now after I've claimed all that, it's

29:45.680 --> 29:47.760
just a doll like eBay.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.840
Yeah, like, why is they're doing it?

29:49.840 --> 29:52.080
They're working around the system, eBay.

29:52.080 --> 29:57.440
Yeah, I have to make a penis cake for my sister's bachelorette party.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.400
Hey, should we?

29:58.400 --> 30:02.960
Yeah, have that be like the have that like be the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, like to be

30:02.960 --> 30:07.280
continued teaser to get people to listen past the advertising break.

30:07.280 --> 30:08.800
Yeah, this is a new thing we're trying.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.200
And so so, you know, that's waiting for you.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.880
But first, let's go to the money zone.

30:12.880 --> 30:27.760
Let me tell you about Squarespace.

30:29.760 --> 30:32.880
Alright, my brother, my brother, me is sponsored in part this week by Squarespace.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.080
Hey, you're not reading this, are you?

30:34.080 --> 30:35.680
This is all coming from the heart, right?

30:35.680 --> 30:38.240
That actually just came off the top of my dome.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.440
I don't know if you know this, Kevin.

30:39.440 --> 30:41.760
This isn't our first money zone.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.680
We've actually talked about Squarespace a lot.

30:43.680 --> 30:44.800
And you know, here's the thing.

30:45.360 --> 30:50.320
Maybe you've heard it a bunch, and it's kind of gone in one ear and out the other.

30:50.320 --> 30:51.040
But you know what?

30:51.040 --> 30:56.080
Maybe in your heart, you've been planning a website for too long.

30:56.080 --> 31:02.880
It's sat there just in your heart, growing fallow because you did not water the seed

31:02.880 --> 31:05.520
of your idea for a website.

31:05.520 --> 31:12.560
But you should, you should plant it in Squarespace and water it with the Squarespace water.

31:12.560 --> 31:13.840
I might have lost the point.

31:13.840 --> 31:14.080
Yes.

31:16.080 --> 31:17.920
Not your best metaphor, I would say.

31:17.920 --> 31:22.640
I thought it started strong, but then definitely kind of spun into Sleepy Travis.

31:22.640 --> 31:27.440
I mean, yeah, your metaphor was just like, it's like a farm and it wasn't good.

31:28.320 --> 31:31.600
Well, I thought it was clear because Squarespace, it's easy.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.800
They have a lot of different options.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.080
Like farming?

31:34.080 --> 31:35.520
Like farming.

31:35.520 --> 31:43.760
They have a lot of like, a lot of tools that will help you make a fast and awesome website.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.640
They got like tractors and shovels on the farm, so.

31:46.640 --> 31:47.040
Exactly.

31:47.040 --> 31:48.240
They have beautiful templates.

31:50.000 --> 31:50.720
That's not a farm.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.240
And also website designs.

31:52.240 --> 31:52.800
Is that a thing?

31:52.800 --> 31:53.200
Yeah.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.440
The way that they lay out the rows of peas.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.680
Or like a Travis, like a barn.

32:00.400 --> 32:01.680
Yes, exactly.

32:01.680 --> 32:05.760
And they have a really awesome 24-7 customer support.

32:05.760 --> 32:06.000
That's hay.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.360
Like farm wizards.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.200
Like farm wizards, exactly.

32:10.960 --> 32:15.600
So no matter what your technical concerns are, customer support can help you.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.560

32:33.360 --> 32:36.080
I made a website there, mackerelshows.com.

32:36.080 --> 32:41.760
Took me like 40 minutes, and I'm very happy with it, and I brag about it all the time.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.240
I think I brag about it every time we do a Squarespace ad.

32:47.680 --> 32:51.440

Squarespace.com slash my brother.

32:57.520 --> 33:03.680
And you get 10% off your purchase, and that's like when you go to a farm

33:03.680 --> 33:06.560
and you blackmail them for free vegetables.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.120
Exactly.

33:07.920 --> 33:14.960
The hardest thing about being a farm wizard is that when the farmer assumes

33:14.960 --> 33:19.760
just because they bring the cord of virgin blood and the eye of tree frogs that you demanded,

33:19.760 --> 33:22.080
they don't also have to bring seeds.

33:22.080 --> 33:25.520
It's like, you have to meet me halfway, you know?

33:25.520 --> 33:28.240
Where am I supposed to pull these potatoes out of my ass?

33:29.680 --> 33:30.640
Because I can.

33:30.640 --> 33:31.280
That is where they come from, yeah.

33:31.280 --> 33:31.760
But it's a lot harder.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.600
I'm an amazing wizard, but it's tough.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.320
I want to tell you all about Blue Apron.

33:36.320 --> 33:42.960
We've talked about Blue Apron so much, and for good reason, because I really, really like Blue Apron.

33:42.960 --> 33:45.760
I've learned how to cook because of Blue Apron.

33:46.560 --> 33:49.200
The way that it works is for less than 10 bucks a meal, Blue Apron.

33:49.200 --> 33:52.720
They will deliver seasonal recipes along with pre-portioned ingredients

33:52.720 --> 33:54.160
to make delicious home-cooked meals.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.680
This month, they have stuff like pan-seared chicken

33:57.680 --> 34:00.320
with roasted fall vegetables and butter caper sauce,

34:00.320 --> 34:03.920
spicy lotus root and purple carrot stir-fry with sweet potato noodles,

34:03.920 --> 34:07.760
lemongrass roasted pork, and Romanesco cauliflower and coconut rice.

34:09.120 --> 34:13.040
The meals are really, really great and easy to prepare,

34:13.040 --> 34:21.360
and they teach you so much about learning the fundamentals of cooking

34:21.360 --> 34:24.560
so that even when you're not cooking a Blue Apron thing, you're better at it.

34:26.480 --> 34:30.480
It's a really wonderful thing that I cannot imagine going without.

34:31.680 --> 34:34.880
You can check out this week's menu and get your first three meals for free

34:34.880 --> 34:38.240
with free shipping if you go to blueapron.com slash my brother.

34:38.240 --> 34:41.120
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.000
Blue Apron.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.920
So we've got some Jumbotrons to share with you,

34:43.920 --> 34:48.800
but first we do want to remind you that the My Brother, My Brother and Me

34:48.800 --> 34:54.560
Jumbotron window is going to be opening back up November 28th at noon Pacific,

34:55.600 --> 34:59.040
and there's the potential of them selling very quickly.

34:59.840 --> 35:00.800
They have in the past.

35:00.800 --> 35:04.560
That's why we kind of had to put a pause on them so we could catch up a little bit.

35:04.560 --> 35:08.080
So if you have been interested in picking up one of those spots,

35:08.080 --> 35:10.560
just know it's going to be first come first serve

35:10.560 --> 35:18.960
starting on November 28th at noon Pacific and those spots will run sometime in 2017.

35:20.960 --> 35:23.600
So let's get into the Jumbotrons for this week, though.

35:24.320 --> 35:27.920
The first one is for Richard, aka Daniel Jackson.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.880
Okay, it's an odd nickname.

35:30.880 --> 35:31.380
Fine.

35:32.080 --> 35:35.360
The message is from Craig, aka twobbles1.

35:37.040 --> 35:40.080
I never would have thought that Halo 3 would increase our friends

35:40.080 --> 35:42.800
and increase our friendship from cousins to besties.

35:44.320 --> 35:45.120
No, it's dead.

35:45.120 --> 35:45.520
It's gone.

35:45.520 --> 35:46.000
It's dead.

35:46.000 --> 35:46.480
Let it go.

35:47.040 --> 35:48.880
We might make one for Christmas.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.160
I don't get it.

35:50.160 --> 35:51.280
What's it about?

35:51.280 --> 35:56.080
Our trip to North Carolina to watch Griffin help me.

35:56.640 --> 35:57.600
Eva?

35:57.600 --> 35:58.720
Eva 3.0?

35:58.720 --> 35:59.760
Maybe Evangelion?

35:59.760 --> 36:00.560
I don't know.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.060
I don't know.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.440
It's still one of my favorite memories,

36:03.440 --> 36:05.680
and I'm really honored to be one of your best friends.

36:05.680 --> 36:06.720
P.S. Happy birthday.

36:07.360 --> 36:08.320
That's awesome.

36:08.880 --> 36:09.440
Yeah.

36:09.440 --> 36:10.240
It's really nice.

36:10.240 --> 36:12.000
It's Evangelion 3.0.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.040
You cannot redo.

36:13.040 --> 36:16.640
It's a fantasy science fiction anime film from 2012.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.600
So you got it in one.

36:20.160 --> 36:20.880
Got it in one.

36:20.880 --> 36:21.920
Happy birthday.

36:22.640 --> 36:25.840
Congrats on getting those sick KD ratios in Halo 3.

36:26.800 --> 36:27.680
Finish the fight.

36:30.240 --> 36:31.760
I'm gonna give the Covenant back their bomb.

36:31.760 --> 36:32.880
Master Chief.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.640
Cortana is back doing their thing.

36:34.640 --> 36:35.760
Look out for the flood.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.280
There's some nasty customers.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.560
Warthogs.

36:38.560 --> 36:39.760
Phantom Menace.

36:41.680 --> 36:46.320
Phantom Menace and Anakin Skywalker.

36:47.680 --> 36:48.960
I have a message for Teddy,

36:48.960 --> 36:51.120
and it's from your brothers Will and John who say,

36:51.120 --> 36:54.240
hey brother, this is from your brothers

36:54.240 --> 36:55.920
by your favorite brothers.

36:55.920 --> 36:57.840
Have a great birthday and rock on.

36:57.840 --> 36:58.720
And then guitar riff.

36:58.720 --> 37:00.080
Justin, can you do the thing with your mouth?

37:00.080 --> 37:12.400
Wait, hold on, was that the Star Spangled Banner?

37:14.240 --> 37:15.520
It sounds like the Star Spangled Banner,

37:15.520 --> 37:17.200
but Jimi Hendrix keeps getting sleepy.

37:21.120 --> 37:22.240
Is that Phantom of the Opera?

37:22.240 --> 37:23.280
Well, it's Phantom of the Opera.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.000
What are you doing?

37:24.000 --> 37:24.480
That's good.

37:24.480 --> 37:28.640
I'll do another one.

37:28.640 --> 37:29.600
That's Oklahoma.

37:29.600 --> 37:30.080
This is fun.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.240
It's like a hard rock show tunes.

37:34.800 --> 37:35.920
It's a belly high.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.400
Wow, you got it in very quickly.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.320
I will play this game for another half hour.

37:40.320 --> 37:40.960
Yeah, here we go.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.440
Gonna wash that man right out of my hair.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.720
You're on a real South Pacific.

37:50.720 --> 37:51.120
I was trying to trick you.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.880
Yeah, real South Pacific bender.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.200
Just trying to trick you with that one.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.720
It didn't work.

37:56.720 --> 38:05.200
Well, this has been our fun new game.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.200
I shouldn't have picked a Hilton song with more melody.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.000
I think you're having a stroke.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.680
Are you just doing guitar for the rap words?

38:13.680 --> 38:18.720
I was doing guitar for the rap words.

38:18.720 --> 38:21.360
Sorry, that was not very good.

38:21.360 --> 38:29.840
I can see why they use words and things now.

38:29.840 --> 38:30.880
Yeah, sorry.

38:30.880 --> 38:31.920
What garbage.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.560
Pick up the fucking Hamilton mixtape.

38:34.560 --> 38:40.480
It's all Justin making his fucking distorted kazoo guitar noise for all the songs.

38:40.480 --> 38:40.880
Sorry.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.400
What movies should I go see this weekend?

38:47.120 --> 38:48.560
Should I care about the Emmys?

38:49.120 --> 38:50.800
Is this meme already dead?

38:50.800 --> 38:52.080
Is VR cool?

38:52.080 --> 38:53.600
What happened to Choose Your Own Adventure book?

38:53.600 --> 38:55.280
Are the Kardashians for real?

38:56.080 --> 38:58.400
For answers to these questions and so much more,

38:58.400 --> 39:02.720
come on over to Pop Rocket, a pop culture roundtable show with me, Guy Branham.

39:02.720 --> 39:03.760
Winter Mitchell.

39:03.760 --> 39:04.640
Margaret Wappler.

39:04.640 --> 39:05.680
And Oliver Wang.

39:05.680 --> 39:11.040
Catch us every Wednesday on MaximumFun.org or wherever you decide to get your podcasts.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.000
I'm not gonna judge.

39:17.040 --> 39:19.040
Give me that dick question though.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.520
Oh yeah, that's right, the dick question.

39:21.520 --> 39:24.640
I have to make a penis cake for my sister's bachelorette party.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.400
What type of penis should I make?

39:26.400 --> 39:28.080
There are so many variations.

39:28.640 --> 39:33.120
Additional note, my sister and her fiancee are both officers in the Navy.

39:33.120 --> 39:37.200
I would like to incorporate this into the penis cake somehow.

39:38.720 --> 39:42.160
That's from Matron of Dishonor in California.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.360
Maybe an anchor tattoo on there?

39:45.360 --> 39:46.960
Yeah, a lot of, uh,

39:46.960 --> 39:50.080
a lot of our sailors.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.160
Sailor Jerry tattoo, mm-hmm.

39:53.120 --> 39:57.200
Um, is it, I mean, there's bigger questions that we need to ask first.

39:57.200 --> 40:00.560
Like, is this, is it cut?

40:02.880 --> 40:05.040
Well, when they serve the cake, it probably will be.

40:05.920 --> 40:06.640
That's fun.

40:06.640 --> 40:09.360
Oh, that's something you can do, like a layer of fondant

40:09.360 --> 40:12.240
that you sort of briss right off there.

40:12.240 --> 40:13.200
Oh, that's fun.

40:13.200 --> 40:16.960
I would watch an entire season of Great British Bake Off that was just

40:17.600 --> 40:19.440
phallic novelty cakes.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.920
Hard, hard, yeah.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.200
Oh, I disagree, Paul.

40:23.200 --> 40:24.640
I think it's a very good bake.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.040
I think it's a wonderful penis.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.640
I think it's a wonderful bake.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.240
You know, how many people do you have to serve?

40:32.240 --> 40:37.280
Because this is like, that's going to inform the scale that you're working with.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.400
Are you dealing with 10?

40:38.400 --> 40:40.000
Are you dealing with 30 people?

40:40.000 --> 40:44.240
Hey, Tammy and her family aren't going to make it, honey, so let's go flaccid.

40:46.880 --> 40:48.640
Yeah, babe, just a little chubbins.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.160
There's going to be like eight of us.

40:50.160 --> 40:51.120
It's going to be like eight of us.

40:51.120 --> 40:52.800
We just need like half masks.

40:52.800 --> 40:57.200
Like you're watching a, uh, like a really sexy lingerie commercial.

40:57.200 --> 40:58.800
Like that kind of, kind of vibe.

41:00.400 --> 41:04.640
Like a JC Penney's catalog page that you shouldn't be looking at.

41:04.640 --> 41:04.960
One of those.

41:04.960 --> 41:08.800
Like watching a Benedict Cumberbatch movie when he does the thing

41:08.800 --> 41:11.120
with his eyes where he's like looking straight into the,

41:11.120 --> 41:12.720
you know what I'm talking about?

41:12.720 --> 41:15.600
When he barrels the camera, barrels the camera, barrels the camera.

41:15.600 --> 41:21.120
You get a, you get a Cumberbatch half chub, you know, you know, a Cumberboner.

41:21.120 --> 41:23.600
You want a good Navy, uh, joke in there.

41:23.600 --> 41:26.480
You could tattoo welcome aboard on the penis.

41:26.480 --> 41:30.400
Yeah, that's a reference to every Navy man's favorite movie.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.280
Down Periscope.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.120
Sorry, Kelsey Grammer.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.880
It could also say mission accomplished.

41:34.880 --> 41:35.520
That's fine.

41:35.520 --> 41:36.880
That's a dick that did it.

41:37.920 --> 41:38.240
Yeah.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.080
Or just like a jaunty cap on there.

41:40.080 --> 41:45.280
Like a, like a Naval, you know, a Naval officers jaunty cap on there.

41:45.280 --> 41:46.480
And maybe it's winking.

41:46.480 --> 41:49.840
Is it too weird to make it like an anthropomorphicized wiener?

41:49.840 --> 41:51.040
Absolutely not, Travis.

41:51.040 --> 41:55.360
Eyes and mouth, like saying like, hey, come eat me up,

41:55.360 --> 41:57.760
ladies and gentlemen and whoever's present.

41:58.560 --> 42:02.240
Um, what we're dancing around this question.

42:03.360 --> 42:06.160
Justin, you've got, you've, you've got the flour.

42:06.160 --> 42:08.880
You've got the pastry spoon.

42:08.880 --> 42:13.280
What kind of ding-a-ling are you, are you doing?

42:13.280 --> 42:14.000
Straight up and down.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.720
Traditional circle, circle, oval.

42:16.720 --> 42:18.240
What do you do the balls?

42:18.240 --> 42:19.680
Is it weird without balls?

42:19.680 --> 42:21.120
Yeah, it's pretty weird without balls.

42:21.120 --> 42:24.560
I think it's kind of balls are sort of the balls are the easy thing.

42:24.560 --> 42:24.800
Yeah.

42:24.800 --> 42:27.520
But the balls are just form the shape that without balls.

42:27.520 --> 42:29.120
It's you would have to sit there.

42:29.120 --> 42:30.080
It's a penis.

42:30.080 --> 42:30.480
Yeah.

42:30.480 --> 42:31.440
The penis.

42:31.440 --> 42:31.920
It's a penis.

42:31.920 --> 42:32.240
Everybody.

42:32.240 --> 42:32.800
It's a penis.

42:32.800 --> 42:33.760
Is that clear?

42:33.760 --> 42:34.160
Is it clear?

42:34.160 --> 42:34.800
I made it.

42:34.800 --> 42:35.120
Okay.

42:35.120 --> 42:35.760
You guys get it.

42:35.760 --> 42:36.000
Okay.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.320
Have you guys ever seen a penis cake?

42:38.320 --> 42:38.800
Yeah, dude.

42:39.760 --> 42:40.800
I've seen more penis cake.

42:40.800 --> 42:41.280
I'll see more.

42:41.280 --> 42:43.760
I've seen more penis cakes than you'll ever forget.

42:43.760 --> 42:48.480
The only time I ever saw one is the first time and only time that I did mushrooms.

42:49.040 --> 42:52.800
And I thought that I had gone, gone down.

42:52.800 --> 42:56.400
I thought that I had gone way past way out there on the edge.

42:56.400 --> 43:00.960
Cause my Jason's brothers made him a penis cake.

43:00.960 --> 43:04.240
And I thought that I had done lost my mind.

43:04.240 --> 43:04.480
Yeah.

43:04.480 --> 43:05.520
You dreamt it.

43:05.520 --> 43:07.360
It was a wonderful dream that you had.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.720
No, I woke up the next morning.

43:08.720 --> 43:09.280
It was still there.

43:09.280 --> 43:10.880
And I was like, well, thank fuck for that.

43:10.880 --> 43:11.280
Yeah.

43:11.280 --> 43:12.560
At least it wasn't, you know.

43:13.280 --> 43:15.760
That pastry dick was your constant in that moment.

43:17.360 --> 43:18.640
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

43:18.640 --> 43:20.480
You know what would be impressive?

43:20.480 --> 43:21.600
I guess not.

43:21.600 --> 43:26.400
I've been watching a lot of those like baking competition shows on Food Network.

43:27.040 --> 43:30.880
3D like standing cake.

43:30.880 --> 43:32.080
Not laying down on a tray.

43:32.080 --> 43:34.160
Everyone does laying down on a tray.

43:34.160 --> 43:41.840
I'm talking a vertical build with maybe some smaller penises on like scaffolding.

43:41.840 --> 43:43.120
Edible, all edible.

43:43.120 --> 43:45.280
Like a dozer scaffolding in Fragile Rock.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.520
Littler penises around it.

43:47.520 --> 43:50.080
Like they're building the bigger penis in the middle.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.680
Like the dozer scaffolding in Fragile Rock.

43:51.680 --> 43:53.280
Like the dozer scaffolding.

43:53.280 --> 43:55.120
When the dozers build penises.

43:55.120 --> 44:00.640
So you want them to make like basically fucking bear a door out of penises.

44:00.640 --> 44:11.120
Just like reaching up to a monument that will live past the time of the penis upon which it is based.

44:11.120 --> 44:11.360
Sure.

44:11.360 --> 44:17.280
You know, something to remind future generations of the penis that existed once.

44:17.280 --> 44:17.600
Yeah.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.720
I think that that's really inspiring, Travis.

44:21.520 --> 44:24.400
I'm just saying if you're going to do the thing, do it.

44:24.400 --> 44:24.960
You know what?

44:24.960 --> 44:25.280
Yeah.

44:25.280 --> 44:27.440
Win the penis cake competition.

44:27.440 --> 44:30.720
So let's never talk about penis cakes ever again.

44:30.720 --> 44:32.080
Or penises.

44:32.080 --> 44:35.040
You know, we could do like a fun moratorium on talking about dicks.

44:35.040 --> 44:35.760
That would be good.

44:35.760 --> 44:38.480
A little self, and here's a jar, and I'm going to put a quarter in it.

44:38.480 --> 44:39.280
It's the cock jar.

44:39.840 --> 44:41.920
So no, don't put that in there.

44:41.920 --> 44:42.880
Stop it, Daniel!

44:43.920 --> 44:45.680
Daniel came along, and you know what he did?

44:46.560 --> 44:47.520
He's fired.

44:47.520 --> 44:48.640
He put his wormy in the jar.

44:48.640 --> 44:49.520
He put his wormy right in the jar.

44:49.520 --> 44:52.000
He's always misinterpreting intentionally.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.960
This one was sent in by fucking Brooks Oglesby again.

44:54.960 --> 44:56.480
Somebody needs a nickname for this.

44:56.480 --> 44:58.240
Somebody needs a nickname, huh?

44:58.240 --> 45:00.800
Or an honorific at least.

45:00.800 --> 45:01.440
We'll think about it.

45:01.440 --> 45:02.880
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

45:02.880 --> 45:03.840
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

45:05.600 --> 45:08.080
There's a Keebler commercial at the top of the page.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.680
So we'll say it's sent in by Garrison Keebler.

45:12.960 --> 45:13.600
Thank you, Garrison.

45:13.600 --> 45:14.480
It's by Yahoo Answers.

45:14.480 --> 45:16.400
Oh, I already said who it was by.

45:16.400 --> 45:16.960
So tired.

45:19.280 --> 45:22.400
Garrison Keebler asks, homemade trampoline?

45:22.400 --> 45:25.200
Would it be possible to make your own homemade trampoline?

45:25.200 --> 45:26.560
And what materials would you need?

45:28.240 --> 45:29.600
This is great.

45:29.600 --> 45:32.240
It harkens back to a simpler time.

45:32.240 --> 45:32.800
Yeah.

45:32.800 --> 45:35.040
Back when everything wasn't store-bought,

45:35.040 --> 45:40.080
when we used to use our hands to make the trampolines we needed.

45:40.080 --> 45:40.560
Yeah.

45:40.560 --> 45:43.120
We weren't just going to the trampoline store and buy,

45:43.120 --> 45:47.040
you know, the big box trampoline store and just buying a trampoline.

45:47.040 --> 45:48.720
We were crafting the tramp-

45:48.720 --> 45:53.200
We had our own, like, heirloom trampolines that, like, our grandpapas made

45:53.200 --> 45:57.680
that we used to bounce on and remember the time before the Great War, you know?

45:57.680 --> 46:02.800
And now everybody's just going to, like, the tramp store and buying a trampoline

46:02.800 --> 46:03.920
that means nothing to them.

46:03.920 --> 46:06.560
And then they throw it away each season and buy a new one.

46:06.560 --> 46:07.060
Yeah.

46:08.240 --> 46:14.240
Everything, everything you could stand on is a trampoline.

46:14.240 --> 46:20.480
It's just the degree to which it is a good and serviceable trampoline, right?

46:20.480 --> 46:27.360
Like, the carpeting, a bad trampoline, beds, a slightly better trampoline.

46:27.360 --> 46:28.160
Do you measure that?

46:28.160 --> 46:31.760
Do you measure, is the metric how fun and bounceable it is

46:31.760 --> 46:35.360
or how the potential for child harm?

46:36.000 --> 46:39.040
Because that's what I, like, if I'm going to pop my own knee up

46:39.040 --> 46:43.280
and bust my nose with my own fucking knee, that's a trampoline.

46:43.280 --> 46:44.320
What I just did.

46:45.280 --> 46:46.160
Have you done that?

46:46.160 --> 46:47.680
Oh, everybody's done that.

46:48.320 --> 46:48.820
Yeah.

46:48.820 --> 46:50.480
Riley broke her leg on one.

46:50.480 --> 46:50.980
Yeah.

46:50.980 --> 46:52.080
It's like a bad bounce.

46:52.080 --> 46:53.040
Just a bad bounce, Mary.

46:53.040 --> 46:54.880
Yeah, that's a bad bounce, Mary.

46:54.880 --> 46:56.400
Isn't a trampoline fun?

46:56.400 --> 47:00.800
Because you think about the idea of the number of things that, like, we've gotten rid of

47:00.800 --> 47:03.280
because of the threat that they put, like lawn darts.

47:03.280 --> 47:08.320
We've gotten rid of toys that have threatened children and yet trampolines seem to endure.

47:08.320 --> 47:17.040
No, it's not. Like, no amount of child injury will ever undo the trampoline from, like, our consciousness.

47:17.040 --> 47:21.520
We have definitely, as a society, like, turned a blind eye towards trampolines.

47:21.520 --> 47:25.600
We've all just accepted the risk of, like, no, listen, I know.

47:25.600 --> 47:27.360
But, like, I'm not, what am I going to do?

47:27.360 --> 47:28.560
Not have a trampoline?

47:29.680 --> 47:35.120
My friend's trying to get clever and put that fucking net, that netting up around the trampoline.

47:35.120 --> 47:41.120
And it's like, dog, all you've done is created a goal for me to try to bounce over.

47:41.120 --> 47:43.520
You put that net up, it's like, how high is that?

47:43.520 --> 47:44.080
Eight feet?

47:44.080 --> 47:46.240
Okay, mission accepted.

47:46.240 --> 47:47.040
Here I go.

47:47.040 --> 47:50.000
Popcorn me, Dylan, I'm out of here.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.080
I need to go to fucking Jupiter.

47:52.080 --> 47:52.800
Bounce me, bro.

47:53.360 --> 47:56.960
Hey, at any point during this conversation, and please be honest,

47:56.960 --> 48:01.200
have you guys had the fleeting thought that, man, it'd be pretty fun to jump on a trampoline right now?

48:01.200 --> 48:06.960
I think I, it would go, I think I could get three jumps on a trampoline before my spine just telescopes.

48:07.840 --> 48:12.720
For me, for me, Justin, trampolines are the child version of the hot tub.

48:12.720 --> 48:13.760
Let me explain.

48:13.760 --> 48:15.200
Seems like super fun idea.

48:15.200 --> 48:18.400
And then three minutes after you've entered it, you think, so this is it?

48:18.400 --> 48:22.400
This is what I, this is what I'm doing now for, like, I just jump on it?

48:22.400 --> 48:23.600
I'm just, okay.

48:23.600 --> 48:27.920
How long should I stay up here so it doesn't look weird that I didn't just, like, get immediately out?

48:27.920 --> 48:30.640
Um, but how do you make one though?

48:31.600 --> 48:34.640
Cause I can't, yeah, springs seem important.

48:34.640 --> 48:39.440
And like, I can't think of what the trampo material there at the top would be,

48:39.440 --> 48:43.920
except reclaimed trampo mesh from another trampo.

48:43.920 --> 48:48.800
You go harvest, you know, if you steal one, that's another, that's a pretty big heist.

48:48.800 --> 48:50.960
But what about tarpaulin?

48:50.960 --> 48:58.320
Could you use just a big tarp and some springs and then a room?

48:58.320 --> 48:59.440
Just a room?

48:59.440 --> 49:04.720
This might be a little bit off the beaten path, but I think if you're going to build your own trampoline,

49:04.720 --> 49:10.240
you should really make it like an in-ground trampoline and maybe cover it with leaves

49:10.240 --> 49:14.800
and then like jump off a balcony and like really scare the shit out of your friends.

49:14.800 --> 49:16.480
Just to prank people.

49:16.480 --> 49:19.840
God, God, Yahoo Answers has the worst commercials.

49:19.840 --> 49:23.920
Imagine, oh, imagine like you call your friend Dylan over to your house and you say,

49:23.920 --> 49:27.520
Dylan, last night I was struck by lightning and I've developed these magical powers.

49:27.520 --> 49:31.040
And then just go running across the yard and jump where you know the trampoline is

49:31.040 --> 49:33.520
and spring way higher into the air than you should.

49:33.520 --> 49:38.080
And just see how long Dylan buys your new personas like the springer.

49:39.120 --> 49:41.520
Yeah, until the first time he's like thinks he's funny and then

49:41.520 --> 49:43.120
throws your frisbee up on top of the house.

49:43.120 --> 49:45.040
And he's like, well, it should be no problem, right?

49:45.040 --> 49:49.280
Yeah, come on, I can't control the powers, Dylan, come and go.

49:49.280 --> 49:50.160
How dare you?

49:51.600 --> 49:52.320
I just like-

49:52.880 --> 49:53.920
You know that, Dylan.

49:54.640 --> 49:56.960
Yahoo is showing me an ad right now.

49:56.960 --> 49:59.120
And you remember when they said Melissa McCarthy died?

49:59.120 --> 49:59.760
Uh-huh.

49:59.760 --> 50:00.720
Trying to get me a click.

50:00.720 --> 50:02.960
Now it's Ellen's shocking goodbye.

50:03.600 --> 50:06.080
Her fans were stunned by her leaked secret.

50:06.080 --> 50:08.480
She kept it hidden from the world the whole time.

50:08.480 --> 50:12.400
And this is linking to a website called pretty skin store.com.

50:14.560 --> 50:18.720
So many secrets are just revealed through these official Yahoo advertisements

50:18.720 --> 50:23.040
that Ellen's skin was purchased from another person's body.

50:24.960 --> 50:26.560
We have to help some more people.

50:26.560 --> 50:29.840
I'm going to speed up some of these questions.

50:29.840 --> 50:30.240
Please.

50:32.240 --> 50:34.960
I was on a popular dating app looking for local singles.

50:34.960 --> 50:38.320
And while swiping, I came across my friend's fiance and her dating profile.

50:38.320 --> 50:38.880
Oh, God.

50:40.320 --> 50:42.160
They have been together for at least a couple of years.

50:42.160 --> 50:44.160
And we meet weekly to play board games.

50:44.160 --> 50:48.240
I've been able to play it cool so far, but it is slowly eating away at me.

50:48.240 --> 50:50.400
I screenshotted the profile photo.

50:50.400 --> 50:53.280
Good job, fucking ace detective.

50:55.280 --> 50:56.400
But I don't know what to do.

50:56.400 --> 50:57.680
Look at the spy over here.

50:58.720 --> 51:02.640
Fucking check out encyclopedia Brown.

51:02.640 --> 51:06.080
Could they be in some sort of open relationship type thing?

51:06.080 --> 51:07.200
And how do I find that out?

51:07.760 --> 51:09.920
Or did I just stumble on the worst thing ever?

51:09.920 --> 51:11.040
Please help.

51:11.040 --> 51:12.960
I didn't swipe right.

51:14.560 --> 51:17.360
And that's from please let this be an open relationship thing

51:17.360 --> 51:18.400
in Washington state.

51:19.760 --> 51:21.520
Hey, hey, hey.

51:23.280 --> 51:25.840
You need to destroy your phone and you don't.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.520
And you need to destroy your phone.

51:27.520 --> 51:31.680
And then like it's in the cloud, Harriet.

51:31.680 --> 51:35.360
So maybe you could go into your cloud and remove that too.

51:35.360 --> 51:38.880
And forget this ever happened and move on with your life.

51:38.880 --> 51:43.600
There are I'm like fucking opening my third eye and there's no.

51:43.600 --> 51:45.680
I'm looking at all the outcomes possible.

51:45.680 --> 51:48.160
And there's none good for you.

51:48.160 --> 51:50.080
Well, here's what you have to do.

51:50.080 --> 51:54.880
You have to go and talk to the fiance that you found on the dating profile

51:54.880 --> 51:57.440
and say, hey, what's the deal with this?

51:57.440 --> 52:00.320
And if it turns out to be something shady,

52:00.320 --> 52:03.440
then they need to tell their partner or you will.

52:03.440 --> 52:06.640
And then you have to build Bixby your way out of town

52:06.640 --> 52:09.200
and move on to the next town where you'll make new friends

52:09.200 --> 52:10.080
and start a new life.

52:10.880 --> 52:11.760
That's exactly it.

52:11.760 --> 52:12.720
Travis, you can.

52:12.720 --> 52:14.960
If you want to do this, you're going to have to pack your bags

52:14.960 --> 52:19.280
and move away because there's no reality in which this breaks good.

52:19.840 --> 52:20.960
No reality.

52:20.960 --> 52:22.560
No, you're the messenger here.

52:22.560 --> 52:25.280
And it tends to go bad for the messenger.

52:26.320 --> 52:28.800
I got news for you, buckaroonie.

52:28.800 --> 52:33.280
If you really, really stumbled onto something like unscrupulous and shady

52:33.280 --> 52:35.600
and you confront this person about it, guess what they're going to do?

52:36.400 --> 52:37.840
They're going to lie.

52:37.840 --> 52:41.840
They're going to lie about it because they are a shady person.

52:41.840 --> 52:43.600
And if they're not, unless they're not.

52:43.600 --> 52:46.800
This is what I'm saying, Griffin. And if they're not, mind your fucking business.

52:48.320 --> 52:48.960
There's this note.

52:48.960 --> 52:52.400
What I'm saying is I'm not presupposing anything about anybody in it.

52:52.400 --> 52:54.160
If you have an open relationship, that's great.

52:54.160 --> 52:56.080
Again, none of your business.

52:57.600 --> 52:58.240
You can't.

52:58.880 --> 52:59.760
You can't.

52:59.760 --> 53:00.320
You can't.

53:00.320 --> 53:03.920
If you do, if you decide to, just know, listen,

53:03.920 --> 53:06.080
I get that impulse of wanting to protect your friend.

53:06.080 --> 53:08.560
And I think that that is very admirable.

53:08.560 --> 53:11.280
Just know, nobody gets out of this clean.

53:11.280 --> 53:15.120
If it breaks bad, nobody comes out of this shining.

53:15.120 --> 53:17.680
Because you're going to be the person.

53:17.680 --> 53:20.640
Even if you did the right thing and you told your friend

53:20.640 --> 53:24.720
and you saved them from entering this shady relationship permanently,

53:24.720 --> 53:26.560
you're still the one who broke them up.

53:26.560 --> 53:28.960
Even if you did the right thing, it breaks bad.

53:28.960 --> 53:30.160
So just know that.

53:30.160 --> 53:31.120
Please, listen.

53:31.840 --> 53:32.880
Let's do something light.

53:32.880 --> 53:35.920
Let me do one last Yahoo before we get into the outro.

53:36.480 --> 53:38.800
Because that one got pretty heavy.

53:39.520 --> 53:40.160
Okay, go.

53:40.160 --> 53:42.000
It's from broxilicalsb, again, hat trick.

53:42.000 --> 53:42.320
Well done.

53:42.320 --> 53:42.960
It's from Yahoo!

53:43.520 --> 53:44.640
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

53:44.640 --> 53:45.920
It's from fucking Ellen.

53:45.920 --> 53:46.480
Thank you, Ellen.

53:46.480 --> 53:47.520
It's by Yahoo!

53:47.520 --> 53:48.880
Insta's user, Ellen, who asks,

53:49.680 --> 53:54.320
how many of you think Adam Sandler is misusing his talents in movies?

53:56.000 --> 53:58.320
First off, let me say that I do realize

53:58.320 --> 54:00.960
Sandler's roots are in comedy as a former comedian.

54:00.960 --> 54:04.960
And he found himself in a niche with kids and slapstick humor.

54:04.960 --> 54:07.440
That said, I think he's misusing his talents as an actor.

54:07.440 --> 54:09.760
Personally, my two favorite movies of him

54:09.760 --> 54:11.760
are Spanglish and The Wedding Singer.

54:11.760 --> 54:13.520
Because he's actually playing an adult,

54:13.520 --> 54:17.520
not a juvenile, infantile character designed to reach people over the age of 10.

54:18.080 --> 54:20.080
He's clearly smart, and he has talent.

54:20.080 --> 54:23.520
But the Billy Madison or obscene movies he has directed, like Mama's Boy,

54:23.520 --> 54:26.080
showing college kids having sex with grandma,

54:26.080 --> 54:28.400
or seniors having their diapers changed,

54:28.400 --> 54:31.200
is rude, disrespectful, and frankly, TMI.

54:32.320 --> 54:33.040
Hold on.

54:33.040 --> 54:36.640
I just hope as he gets older, he will use his brain more in moviemaking

54:36.640 --> 54:38.240
and go for a more grown-up audience.

54:38.240 --> 54:41.440
Well, he did make a movie called Grown-Ups.

54:41.440 --> 54:42.960
He did. He made two movies called Grown-Ups.

54:42.960 --> 54:46.080
I don't know if he thinks he's appealing to the common man with his older movies.

54:46.080 --> 54:50.080
And if he does, it's a sad testament to how far our society has regressed.

54:50.080 --> 54:50.880
Don't get me wrong.

54:50.880 --> 54:53.760
The kids' movies were funny, but they get too old.

54:53.760 --> 54:55.440
And then there's an update that I don't...

54:56.000 --> 54:57.440
People get very defensive.

54:57.440 --> 54:59.040
It's very interesting that...

54:59.040 --> 55:02.720
It's interesting you should bring up Adam Sandler in this episode,

55:02.720 --> 55:06.400
because the one and only time I did Mushrooms,

55:06.400 --> 55:09.840
I watched Punch Drunk Love and it became a cartoon

55:09.840 --> 55:12.160
and bled out on the walls and was incredible.

55:12.160 --> 55:15.360
And I've never had the courage to watch it again since,

55:15.360 --> 55:18.720
because there's no way it lives up to that experience.

55:18.720 --> 55:20.960
But I do remember thoroughly enjoying it.

55:20.960 --> 55:22.640
I do want to also say I'm a cop,

55:22.640 --> 55:25.520
and this whole podcast has been a long sting.

55:25.520 --> 55:27.600
And both of you guys are going to drug jails.

55:28.160 --> 55:28.720
Oh, no.

55:30.720 --> 55:34.400
Mr. Sandler, the diaper changing, it's gotta go.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.760
It just has to go.

55:35.760 --> 55:39.920
It's because it's TMI, Adam, Mr. Sandler.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.560
I wish he would grow up from the movies he made first

55:42.560 --> 55:44.240
and now he's making older movies.

55:44.240 --> 55:45.680
That's how time works.

55:46.880 --> 55:48.560
That's how linear time works.

55:48.560 --> 55:51.760
I don't like the movies where he's a young man making young jokes.

55:51.760 --> 55:53.760
Yeah, not if you have the click remote.

55:53.760 --> 55:56.000
If you have the click remote, it doesn't have to work like that.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.320
It's just so funny to me to say,

55:58.320 --> 56:00.160
I think he's wasting his time doing comedy.

56:00.720 --> 56:03.520
He should do more movies like The Wedding Singer.

56:03.520 --> 56:06.320
A comedy.

56:06.320 --> 56:07.760
He should do more Spanglish.

56:07.760 --> 56:08.720
Spanglish 2.

56:09.520 --> 56:10.880
What are they going to do this time?

56:10.880 --> 56:13.200
What's that crazy family going to do this time?

56:13.200 --> 56:14.480
Rain Over Me 2.

56:14.480 --> 56:15.440
Rain Over Me 2.

56:15.440 --> 56:17.120
He's still very, very upset.

56:18.240 --> 56:19.280
Cobbler 2, still.

56:19.280 --> 56:20.080
Coblin.

56:20.080 --> 56:20.720
Coblin 2.

56:20.720 --> 56:23.200
God, somebody's got to put these fucking shoes together.

56:23.200 --> 56:24.480
Adults do.

56:24.480 --> 56:25.920
No diapers in this one.

56:25.920 --> 56:26.800
That was my review.

56:28.000 --> 56:28.720
Six stars.

56:28.720 --> 56:33.040
I'm pretty sure Blended was not a comedy.

56:33.040 --> 56:35.520
Shaquille O'Neal was in it.

56:35.520 --> 56:37.440
And everything he touches turns to joke gold.

56:38.000 --> 56:42.240
But that was the hat trick of the Barrymore Sandler combo.

56:43.520 --> 56:44.880
And I like how mature it was.

56:46.480 --> 56:49.360
Sensitive subjects handled sensitively.

56:49.360 --> 56:52.000
It was really dealing with some real ass shit, you know?

56:52.000 --> 56:54.480
Because they did, you know, Wedding Singer,

56:54.480 --> 56:57.280
which I guess was pretty adult.

56:57.280 --> 56:59.120
And then 50 First Dates.

56:59.120 --> 57:02.480
A lot, a lot of heavy themes in there.

57:03.040 --> 57:06.640
And I think in Blended, they were both single parents.

57:07.600 --> 57:09.600
And maybe they killed someone together.

57:09.600 --> 57:10.320
I didn't see it.

57:10.320 --> 57:15.360
Can I go and go back to bed?

57:16.240 --> 57:18.320
And Justin, you could go too.

57:18.320 --> 57:21.360
And Travis, you just recap the entire plot of Blended.

57:21.360 --> 57:22.880
And then I haven't seen it.

57:22.880 --> 57:24.880
But I can tell you what I think happens in it.

57:24.880 --> 57:28.560
Okay, and when it's over, that's the end of the episode.

57:29.200 --> 57:30.000
All your usual stuff.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.600
Thanks, John Rojcik and the Long Winches, Maximum Fun,

57:31.600 --> 57:32.160
and all that stuff.

57:32.160 --> 57:34.880
But I'm not going to talk anymore about Blended.

57:34.880 --> 57:35.760
Not till I see it.

57:35.760 --> 57:36.960
And then I will report back.

57:36.960 --> 57:39.120
It'll be like a book report, but for movies.

57:39.120 --> 57:40.560
I'm very much looking forward to that.

57:40.560 --> 57:42.640
I cannot wait for your book report on Blended.

57:42.640 --> 57:46.720
Yes, something to, finally, something to look forward to.

57:48.640 --> 57:50.400
So we'll have that next week.

57:50.400 --> 57:51.840
It's just going to be all about Blended.

57:51.840 --> 57:56.640
And we are going to, here's one thing that's kind of fun

57:57.360 --> 57:58.640
on the horizon.

57:58.640 --> 58:03.840
We do a podcast with the fellows from The Worst Idea of All Time.

58:04.640 --> 58:08.320
It is an annual, eternal podcast that will never stop,

58:08.320 --> 58:11.280
no matter what, called Till Death Do Us Blart.

58:11.280 --> 58:16.480
And every year on, we release it on the American Thanksgiving

58:16.480 --> 58:19.360
every year, and it is a review of the film.

58:19.360 --> 58:20.720
We're going to be recording that soon,

58:20.720 --> 58:22.000
and that'll be there for you.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.080
So if you don't, if you missed that the first time around,

58:24.080 --> 58:25.440
go ahead and subscribe, catch up.

58:25.440 --> 58:26.320
You don't want to be lost.

58:27.040 --> 58:28.480
The film is Pablo Marcob 2.

58:28.480 --> 58:29.360
Did you say that?

58:29.360 --> 58:30.160
I believe I did.

58:30.160 --> 58:32.480
But Pablo Marcob 2 is the name of the film.

58:32.480 --> 58:34.960
It's such a good film because it's impossible to say quickly.

58:34.960 --> 58:36.080
Like you just heard Justin try.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.200
Pablo Maca.

58:37.200 --> 58:38.080
Pablo Maca.

58:38.640 --> 58:39.140
Two.

58:39.840 --> 58:42.080
Hello, I am Pablo Maca.

58:43.760 --> 58:45.440
I am the man sent here to kill you.

58:46.400 --> 58:48.720
I also wanted to, I'm working on a project,

58:48.720 --> 58:53.200
a little bit of a fundraiser, there are some people.

58:54.080 --> 58:56.800
So I recorded a quick chat thing,

58:56.800 --> 58:59.040
a little message to people, eight minutes long.

58:59.040 --> 59:03.280
And as part of it, I talked about that if you're scared

59:03.280 --> 59:05.920
and feeling alone, I'm holding your hand.

59:05.920 --> 59:08.640
And some people really kind of took that

59:08.640 --> 59:12.080
and ran with it online to try to make sure

59:12.080 --> 59:14.000
that everybody knows that they're supported

59:14.000 --> 59:15.120
and that they're all connected

59:15.120 --> 59:17.200
and that nobody needs to feel alone.

59:17.200 --> 59:19.360
And it inspired me to take it one step further.

59:19.360 --> 59:21.200
And I had a bunch of awesome artists,

59:21.200 --> 59:24.800
including Kate Leth and David Pemberton

59:24.800 --> 59:27.120
and Taylor Smurls working on one for me

59:27.120 --> 59:30.240
and a ton of other people on Twitter submitted designs

59:30.240 --> 59:34.640
for I Am Holding Your Hand buttons that I am selling

59:34.640 --> 59:38.240
and the profits for it are going to support the ACLU.

59:39.360 --> 59:41.120
So if you're interested in checking them out,

59:41.120 --> 59:44.880
you can go to bit.ly forward slash I Am Holding Your Hand.

59:44.880 --> 59:46.720
All one word, all lowercase.

59:46.720 --> 59:49.600
And maybe buy a button for a good cause.

59:49.600 --> 59:53.120
And then also wearing the button could signal someone

59:53.120 --> 59:55.360
who needs to know in the moment that they're not alone.

59:55.360 --> 59:57.280
It could say like, hey, I'm here for you.

59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.480
That was kind of the impetus for the whole project.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.720
And if you find yourself needing to hear

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.760
a little bit more in depth what I talked about

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.760
on that eight minute recording,

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.400
I've got it pinned to the top of my Twitter account

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.920
and you can listen to it there.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.840
Thank you for your support.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:24.160
Is there anything else major on the horizon?

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.120
One more thing, only cause I forgot to mention it last time.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:31.600
I did get a new Cincinnati P.O. Box set up.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.640
It's under Macro Shows content.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.960
Some people asked me with the baby being born

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.640
if I had set that up yet, I did.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:46.400
It is P.O. Box 36384, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45236.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.280
So yeah, if you got stuff for all three of us,

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.000
I know it's a pain, but it would really help

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.320
if you would just send those to the boxes

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.320
cause we don't live together and it just ends up,

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.640
I don't want anything to get lost in the shuffle.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:00:59.440
I guess that's what I'm saying.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.440
Yeah, I also just want to say and I don't want to get too heavy

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.520
cause I think that folks don't want more heavy stuff right now

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.320
but like how much I appreciate this community

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.040
and the support y'all show each other and us

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:18.640
is like the kind of the thing that helped me get through

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.320
when I guess when this goes up last week.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.360
So from the bottom of my heart, thank you all very much

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.560
and we'll keep trying to make a fun show

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:30.800
that you can listen to and just put all your-

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.440
No, we're not gonna try, we're not gonna try.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.000
We're gonna do it.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:34.800
We're not gonna try.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.000
We're not gonna try, we're gonna fucking continue to do it

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.840
and it's gonna be better than ever

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.080
and everybody's gonna listen to it in the world.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.360
That one's a little over a bit of an overreach

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.240
but we are gonna continue to be here.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.880
Nothing can stop this ever.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.560
I'm just like guys, I'm just like this Yahoo page is open

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.920
and the ad is forget needing a gun.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.640
This tactical flashlight can blind a bear.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:07.040
And now it's a Philadelphia cream cheese advertisement.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.160
Yeah, it can blind a bear.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.200
If you click it, it links to fucking slow cooker recipes.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.680
There's just no consistency.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.560
There's no, no.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.520
Okay, Griffin, give me that final Yahoo.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:17.840
Yeah, thanks.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.520
Also thanks to John Roderick and Long Winters.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.800
Thank you to Maximum Fun.

Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Robert.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.800
Robert, one loaded.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.480
It's from Robert.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.640
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.440
Robert asks,

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.120
what was that cartoon movie that had a bunch of cars?

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.560
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.680
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.800
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.080
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:03:00.160
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.520
