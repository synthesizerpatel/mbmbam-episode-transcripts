00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.920
Who's that at the door? Can I guess? Can I wager a guess?

00:51.440 --> 00:55.680
Wager a guess, Griffin. Is it the maximum fun tax collector?

00:55.680 --> 01:01.440
It's the tax man. He's here at the door and the time has come. The bill is due.

01:02.080 --> 01:07.120
You've had a lot of fun over the past year, and now it's time to pay the piper.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.440
The pony piper. It's time to go to the comedy debtor's prison.

01:11.760 --> 01:14.560
My name is Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

01:14.560 --> 01:19.200
My name is Griffin McElroy. I'll eat the fingernails off your fingers if you don't donate.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.640
That's like my form of mafia torture, I guess. I don't know.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.080
Let me say that this is my brother and my brother made an advice show for the modern era,

01:30.080 --> 01:37.920
and this week is Max Fun Drive, and that means my advice is that the bill is due.

01:37.920 --> 01:41.680
It's not really advice as much as it is a threat. Guys, for real though,

01:41.680 --> 01:48.080
you know, I love doing these drives because it's crazy that people support us in this way,

01:48.960 --> 01:54.240
but the more years that pass, I start to feel guilty because I can't believe how much support

01:54.240 --> 02:01.120
we've gotten in past years. You know what I mean? I feel like we're sort of pushing it to continue

02:01.120 --> 02:06.880
asking for support, but it really does help us and the network grow in pretty significant ways.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.960
It doesn't help us. It gets us money. Don't you want us to have money?

02:10.960 --> 02:14.480
Don't you like us? Aren't we your friends? Why don't you give your friends more money

02:14.480 --> 02:17.360
if they needed it? Money is good to have for the things to do.

02:19.120 --> 02:25.360
Here's the way I look at it. The Max Fun Drive is not about getting money from our friends as much

02:25.360 --> 02:30.880
as I would like it to be. It's about celebrating the relationship that's formed between our

02:30.880 --> 02:36.240
supporters and the things that they support. It's us saying thank you and welcome to the

02:36.240 --> 02:43.040
family to new donors. And that'll be $500. That'll be $500. Don't try and pay us in yen

02:43.920 --> 02:51.440
or rubles or rupees from Zelda or RuPaul's. Don't try and give us five RuPaul's.

02:52.080 --> 02:56.400
We cannot spend that at Trader Joe's. We just can't. I tried.

02:58.160 --> 03:02.320
Anyway, this is our pleasure episode. We'll be talking more about what that means.

03:02.320 --> 03:09.440
The short version is you are about to become a member of the Max... Okay, so the Max Fun Fund

03:09.440 --> 03:14.240
is like a family, okay? And if you don't give us money, then you're not a member of the family.

03:14.240 --> 03:18.080
If you do give us money, you can give us more money and just like any other family,

03:18.080 --> 03:25.840
become more loved. And increase your status in the family. You could become the dad.

03:26.400 --> 03:30.560
You could become the dad of the family. Isn't that what you want? Anyway, let's help people

03:30.560 --> 03:35.920
and then we'll talk about this a little bit more. I regularly heat up leftovers at work

03:35.920 --> 03:40.320
and eat them at my cubicle for my lunch break. When this happens, passing colleagues feel

03:40.320 --> 03:44.560
compelled to let me know how delicious my lunch smells as they pass by, which for some reason

03:44.560 --> 03:48.960
makes me highly uncomfortable. Is there a way to get them to chill? Or am I at fault,

03:48.960 --> 03:52.960
having fired the first olfactory shot when I filled the office with reheated burrito

03:52.960 --> 04:00.800
fragrance? Tommy S, it is your fault. Is it? You gotta eat that food cold like a failure.

04:00.800 --> 04:07.360
The only thing that makes sense in this world is for everyone to eat a scentless lunch in the

04:07.360 --> 04:11.440
office. If you're reheating, if you're bringing in leftovers... I cannot tell you how many times

04:12.240 --> 04:17.280
one of the many break rooms I've inhabited in one of my many retail jobs has been filled

04:17.280 --> 04:25.840
with a perfume of something like old salad stuffed in a burger that is also old. And it's very

04:25.840 --> 04:32.400
unpleasant. At least he's rolling up with good smelling burritos. Says he. Fair. Maybe they're

04:32.400 --> 04:36.960
trying to get... maybe it's like a little passive aggressive like, mmm, I really smell that. That

04:36.960 --> 04:42.240
has a very present smell to me. Can I tell you how my brain works? Because I'm a fucking eight

04:42.240 --> 04:46.160
year old. And this is very much like the part of my brain that whenever you guys would have

04:46.160 --> 04:51.680
birthdays because you have the same birthday, I had to get a present too, which I think probably

04:51.680 --> 04:57.040
ruined me for life. But whenever I would be at work and I would smell somebody cooking pizza,

04:57.040 --> 05:02.880
I would always be like, Ah, shit, Dan went out for pizza for everybody. No, it's not. Dan's going

05:02.880 --> 05:10.000
on a private, private, solo, damn pizza adventure. That's why what you got to do is you got to heat

05:10.000 --> 05:14.960
up your burrito and then escape the building and spend five minutes outside of that hell hole

05:14.960 --> 05:21.680
for once. Go get in your car, a little car dining. How romantic. Heat it up on the cigarette lighter.

05:22.400 --> 05:29.520
Just like in Goofy Movie. Just like in Goofy Movie. Have some Hi Dad Soup. Have some Hi Dad

05:29.520 --> 05:36.000
Soup Goofy Movie. That's a Goofy Movie deep talk. Power line. Just saying things. Leaning Tower of

05:36.000 --> 05:41.760
Cheats. Just saying things from Goofy Movie. Just a little Goofy Movie free association jazz.

05:41.760 --> 05:45.680
It doesn't have to be funny as long as you recognize it.

05:45.680 --> 05:55.680
Man, I feel for this person because like I haven't actually worked too many jobs where

05:56.400 --> 06:01.200
I don't think I ever actually had a job where I worked with more than like two people at the same

06:01.200 --> 06:08.000
time. A lot of small retail environments. But it would make me pretty angry when somebody would

06:08.000 --> 06:15.200
bring in leftovers because it's like that's good food probably. That's good food and like

06:15.200 --> 06:19.680
we literally have no way of getting at that. There's a Hardee's across the street but that's

06:19.680 --> 06:25.200
just sort of just a thing to fill the hole that's inside my body that gives me strength to scan

06:25.200 --> 06:30.480
documents. Right. Tommy, let me tell you why it makes you uncomfortable when people

06:30.480 --> 06:37.600
recognize your food smells. It's because in any job pretty much I would say 100% of the time

06:37.600 --> 06:44.240
your job is to not get noticed and then suddenly something you can't help is drawing attention to

06:44.240 --> 06:51.760
you, Tommy, and that's scary. It's like prairie dogs. You gotta stay low. Don't pop up too high

06:51.760 --> 06:55.840
or the hawks are gonna swoop down and eat you. It's a reason you never see those little motherfuckers

06:55.840 --> 07:02.960
eating burritos. That's true. Next time someone compliments the smell, whip out a secret fork that

07:02.960 --> 07:08.240
you had hidden in your pocket and just like- Dive in, my man. Indicate that you want to get in there

07:08.800 --> 07:12.960
and then people will learn. You want to double team this or what? That will make them so highly

07:12.960 --> 07:16.240
uncomfortable. Are we gonna dance around this all day or are we gonna make this happen? Let's get

07:16.240 --> 07:22.720
this thing eaten. You could also only bring in foods. There are foods we can acknowledge

07:23.440 --> 07:31.920
that are basically inedible after they have aged a day. French fries. French fries. Yeah,

07:31.920 --> 07:36.800
that's exactly what I was thinking. I've never eaten a french fry or day two. 24 hours later,

07:36.800 --> 07:41.440
I was like, mm, goddamn french fries. So I was like, ugh, that's the second time around.

07:43.840 --> 07:50.640
So maybe that's an option. Cheeses. That's the thing. Anytime I get french fries at a restaurant

07:50.640 --> 07:57.280
and I do some sort of doggy bag, I almost always have french fries with me, but I don't know what

07:57.280 --> 08:01.360
I'm supposed to do with this. They're a garnish adapt. They change from food to garnish.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.320
They're basically packing material. It just adds weight to the bag to make you feel you've

08:04.320 --> 08:10.560
accomplished something. Yeah. I guess the best advice I can give you is to not eat in the building.

08:10.560 --> 08:15.920
Go out to your car. Or devise a special suit that you can wear that you put the food inside before

08:15.920 --> 08:21.360
you eat it. A little space suit for your food. You know what I mean? And it keeps all the smells

08:21.360 --> 08:25.360
trapped inside and then maybe you can put on the suit and eat it from within. Sort of like in the

08:25.360 --> 08:31.840
movie gravity. Get something like, yeah, right. Where the astronauts wear where it's like it's

08:31.840 --> 08:37.840
warmed by soup, like soup circulating through the suit and you can just dip into a nozzle

08:37.840 --> 08:43.040
and slurp some down. Do not grab the wrong nozzle. Don't grab the wrong nozzle. Don't get the wrong

08:43.040 --> 08:47.680
don't let that soup just flow free. That's how that astronaut almost drowned. Did you hear about

08:47.680 --> 08:53.360
that soup? I heard about that on the news channel. Yeah. Loaded potato soup going in there and it was

08:53.360 --> 08:57.760
just free floating in space, getting in his nose and his eyes and his gullet and he couldn't breathe

08:57.760 --> 09:04.080
and he died in space and he's still up there. Like, like, like, yeah. You know what? I just

09:04.080 --> 09:12.480
like you so much. Me too. You got a fucking bad hand. Go for the Yahoo. Sure. Um, this Yahoo was.

09:12.480 --> 09:17.280
I knew you would. I thought you would at least. Okay. This Yahoo was sent in by David DeCruz.

09:17.280 --> 09:24.880
Thank you David. It's by Yahoo. It's by Yahoo answers user Olivia who asks best exercise

09:25.680 --> 09:33.680
to get rid of a long bum. What? Best exercise to get rid of a long bum.

09:35.600 --> 09:42.960
I know exercise is not my cup of tea at all, but I've got one of those quote long bums

09:42.960 --> 09:48.480
unquote and lately I'm a bit paranoid about it. Ways to make it go.

09:52.400 --> 09:58.160
I've got one of those long bums that you read about. You can't just put things in quotes and

09:58.160 --> 10:02.800
make them a thing. That's not how English works. Is this going to be one of those things where

10:02.800 --> 10:06.640
we're going to like make fun of this for being like a made up bullshit thing and then we're

10:06.640 --> 10:12.720
going to get all these emails where it's like I'm from Ireland and here we say long bum all the time.

10:12.720 --> 10:16.720
Maybe that person's from Ireland. Or maybe it's an affliction that specifically affects Ireland.

10:16.720 --> 10:22.480
Like oh you might. It's basically like two cone heads down there.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.480
That's what I'm imagining. It's just like two cone heads down there.

10:28.480 --> 10:35.040
Just dipping into Urban Dictionary real quick. Okay. Oh a long bum is a long flat ass

10:35.840 --> 10:41.120
usually although not exclusively found on older middle-aged women. How can it be long and like

10:41.120 --> 10:48.320
a duck spill? Apparently at one point it stuck out but now it's fallen. Apparently your butt starts

10:48.320 --> 10:53.600
between your shoulder blades and stops mid-thigh so it's just like a long. Oh my god okay so it's

10:53.600 --> 10:59.840
long up and down not long. Yes exactly. Okay so I was imagining a sort of a protrusion right that's

10:59.840 --> 11:05.520
thank you or like a like a plesiosaur. Is that right? Yes. Were they the ones that had the thing?

11:05.520 --> 11:11.120
Uh it is often accentuated by unstylish ill-fitting high-waisted pants or skirts.

11:11.120 --> 11:15.440
If we're talking about a butt because I'm still having trouble wrapping my mind around the

11:15.440 --> 11:23.120
proportions are we are we talking about this being long on the horizontal axis?

11:23.120 --> 11:28.080
No we're talking about a bum that starts. Can she throw it over her shoulder like a continental soldier?

11:29.200 --> 11:33.440
I'm talking about a bum that starts at the back of the nape of your neck and extends down to your

11:33.440 --> 11:39.920
ankles to where if you fall backwards it is. You can spread out your arms and glide like a squirrel.

11:39.920 --> 11:48.320
Okay I still I don't think that's true. I don't think a person can have that in like function.

11:48.320 --> 11:53.520
Apparently you just think that because you don't know enough middle-aged women because apparently

11:53.520 --> 11:59.040
according to Urban Dictionary that's our target demo here. Middle-aged women at some point just

11:59.040 --> 12:05.840
like fucking rupture and divide up the back. It's called migrating butt.

12:06.400 --> 12:12.000
Yeah only when there's a full moon though. My question is how would Sir Mix-A-Lot feel about this?

12:12.880 --> 12:20.400
He would probably like be initially really into it and then think like I don't know like hey mama

12:20.400 --> 12:28.560
I'm loving it you know what actually I do like big butts but like like spacious butts I don't know.

12:28.560 --> 12:34.320
Right I like butts with a lot of volume not with not square footage I don't care about diameter

12:34.320 --> 12:41.760
so much as I care about volume. You have your butt's radius is like unhealthy it seems like

12:42.720 --> 12:47.520
it's hard to say. Baby got a back that is literally a hundred percent composed of butt.

12:48.080 --> 12:52.960
It's yeah like your whole back like I mean that literally you have butt you have a back that is

12:52.960 --> 12:59.600
a butt. I don't think that's what this is I think a long bum is just a bum that sticks out really far

12:59.600 --> 13:04.880
from the back and you have to wear special prescription pants to get it in there. See I

13:04.880 --> 13:08.560
think that's a look everybody's going for I don't think that's something you need to work off. No

13:08.560 --> 13:17.920
no but you understand it's not like a round like you know you know round a nice round uh rump it's

13:17.920 --> 13:27.760
just um I don't know it's just like a like a ray it just shoots out there. Are you talking about

13:27.760 --> 13:34.960
a bum that is entirely composed of light? Can we stop saying bum? I'm just using the vernacular

13:34.960 --> 13:40.560
so like a a butt sorry it is composed of light. Listen no description that we can come up with

13:40.560 --> 13:46.320
is going to be better than my two cone heads thing. I think we already nailed the visual

13:46.320 --> 13:53.840
like two two leaders just sort of like popping out there uh what exercise can we do to shorten

13:53.840 --> 13:58.400
this thing? You got to lay down on your stomach and then put weights on top of it and slowly let

13:58.400 --> 14:02.640
it push back down. You're gonna have to lay there for a month you're gonna need caretakers and

14:02.640 --> 14:09.200
you're gonna get more weight you're trading off long bum for bed source but you you stand up you

14:09.200 --> 14:15.440
put books on your bum and then you walk like a beautiful lady across the room and eventually

14:15.440 --> 14:20.960
with your perfect posture you will eliminate long bum. I don't think you'll eliminate it as much I

14:20.960 --> 14:26.320
think you'll probably just sort of hinge it down I think you'll just bend it down at like a like a

14:26.320 --> 14:31.680
110 degree angle um which is still not ideal but at that point you can at least sort of tuck it

14:31.680 --> 14:37.840
into your pant legs. I think the nice thing about the book solution is even if it doesn't get rid of

14:37.840 --> 14:42.960
your long bum you'll discover that you have some very convenient built-in shelving. I don't think

14:42.960 --> 14:47.760
you could put like just books on your butt and walk around and be like. So wait a minute Griffin

14:47.760 --> 14:53.120
just so I'm clear you you don't think you could put books on your butt and walk around is that

14:53.120 --> 14:59.360
what you're saying? I just want to clarify after almost 200 episodes this is where you draw the

14:59.360 --> 15:06.080
kind of improv line. No it's just we're spending so much time asking can we do this and we should

15:06.080 --> 15:10.640
spend time thinking should we do this and the answer. And then you're slapping it on a lunchbox

15:10.640 --> 15:15.440
and you're selling it you're selling it. You can't you can't. You're putting your lunchbox on your

15:15.440 --> 15:21.120
butt and you're carrying it you're carrying it. You have a crazy long bum it's very stable it's a

15:21.120 --> 15:29.120
load-bearing bum. Your bum finds a way out of your pants and extends into infinity. The bum of the

15:29.120 --> 15:36.480
mind. We've said nobody's listening anymore because we said bum too many times. Uh this is uh our

15:36.480 --> 15:42.880
pledge drive show and we joked about it at first but uh this is legitimately um a really important

15:42.880 --> 15:49.760
time of year and we're doing a longer episode for you because hey that's what uh we're here for. So

15:50.320 --> 15:58.720
uh uh Maximum Fund Drive 2014 if you pledge to give us some money every month right and what

15:58.720 --> 16:03.280
does that money go to? It's going to help fund our shows it's going to help us acquire new shows

16:03.280 --> 16:09.120
it's going to help us make the great shows that you love so very very very much. Can we point out

16:09.120 --> 16:15.280
like uh earlier this year we spent that money on getting Travis a new computer because his fucking

16:15.280 --> 16:21.600
literally died while we were recording a show. Uh it we it helped expand the network we added what

16:21.600 --> 16:25.920
four new shows. No not even that because we added fucking saw bones in the last year.

16:25.920 --> 16:33.040
Yeah and it's there's there's a lot uh and it lets us make great stuff so but but here's the thing

16:33.040 --> 16:39.200
if you pledge some money to help us out you are not just throwing it down a vacuum and hoping it

16:39.200 --> 16:46.400
finds a nice home. No in fact you are going to get some lovely lovely gifts. If you could pledge just

16:46.400 --> 16:51.120
five dollars a month maybe times are tight and you can only do five that is totally understandable

16:51.120 --> 16:56.880
and we still appreciate you very much. In fact we are going to give you access to a staggering amount

16:57.440 --> 17:04.000
of bonus content it is unfathomable. You'll literally shit you'll literally when you open up the

17:04.000 --> 17:07.840
fucking. You will because there's so much you won't be able to tear yourself away from it and you'll

17:07.840 --> 17:12.560
just end up shitting because you sat in the same place for like 14 hours. When you fucking tap our

17:12.560 --> 17:17.040
comedy cloud you best be sitting on John because you're gonna you're gonna dump right there.

17:17.040 --> 17:24.160

22:21.360 --> 22:26.560
listen we need you we appreciate you thank you so much uh i have another question i'm a wedding

22:26.560 --> 22:32.160
photographer i love the way you say i love i'm just now realizing this almost after 200 episodes

22:32.160 --> 22:36.320
and maybe it's because i like listen to it while we're doing it and i edit it you have so many

22:36.320 --> 22:41.200
words that you toss an extra r into at the beginning of it and it's the most family circus

22:41.200 --> 22:45.200
like most adorable thing in the entire world now what are you what are you referring to exactly

22:45.200 --> 22:53.360
you just said photographer you went full-blown jeffy for like a half second i think you have

22:53.360 --> 23:01.280
a very like selective aphasia and it's like a jeffy aphasia a joff asia i'm a wedding

23:01.280 --> 23:06.480
for i'm a wedding photographer

23:08.320 --> 23:12.800
justin have you ever uh did you ever take a science class and learn all about phretosynthesis

23:15.360 --> 23:19.280
he was my favorite ability of harvest to feed themselves by standing in the sun sure

23:19.840 --> 23:25.760
i'm a wedding photographer and some of my friends of mine from high school who i haven't really kept

23:25.760 --> 23:30.240
in touch with hired me to shoot their wedding they sent me a wedding invitation which is unusual

23:30.240 --> 23:35.600
should i feel obligated to bring a wedding gift even though i wouldn't have been invited if i

23:35.600 --> 23:43.200
weren't doing their photos that's from ben in toronto toronto i was going to ask like were you

23:43.200 --> 23:49.200
close in high school but i guess if you like if you know you wouldn't have been invited if you

23:49.200 --> 23:53.360
weren't the photographer that kind of answer well no i mean they may have been close in high school

23:53.360 --> 23:57.760
but like i have people that i was close to in high school that i like i just haven't kept in touch

23:57.760 --> 24:04.480
with and i didn't invite them to my wedding um but i think that's the question is like were you super

24:04.480 --> 24:09.760
good friends and you're also the photographer there is a huge variable here that this person

24:09.760 --> 24:16.000
did not include uh and it will affect any judgment we could possibly render on this subject and that

24:16.000 --> 24:21.360
is are they paying you to photograph their wedding because if they just fucking invited you oh man i

24:21.360 --> 24:26.640
really don't want to pay for a photographer do we know anybody oh yeah well he he specifically

24:26.640 --> 24:32.080
said they hired him to do it well okay but that's a that's a win either way the solution's the same

24:32.080 --> 24:36.480
either way i don't think that that changes the the verdict because one of two things is happening

24:36.480 --> 24:44.000
here either you are hired labor right you're being paid to do a job there in which case you wouldn't

24:44.000 --> 24:49.200
bring a gift because any more than the guy that's going to carve up the prime rib it would bring the

24:49.200 --> 24:54.640
roast that wouldn't make any sense he brings the meat he brings the meat and that's his gift now

24:54.640 --> 24:59.840
flip side if you are not getting paid and they just ask you to shoot photos oops looks like

24:59.840 --> 25:06.000
you already got your gift and it's called your talent hey and how about that's the best gift

25:06.000 --> 25:12.960
ever that's like a 1200 gift that's like a crazy expensive gift now that said what you don't want

25:12.960 --> 25:17.760
to do is voluntarily if they are going to pay you 1200 dollars ben do not call them and say

25:17.760 --> 25:21.680
that's going to be my gift to you because you need to feed yourself and close yourself

25:21.680 --> 25:26.640
and and house yourself yeah no you would no no you're not going to offer this if it is understood

25:26.640 --> 25:33.360
that you're doing this for free no gift if they're paying you no gift this this is a you are scott

25:33.360 --> 25:40.400
free here okay you are you are completely completely fine um now if you want to maybe

25:40.400 --> 25:46.000
throw them in a few extra prints at the end maybe a few extra wall-e's maybe higher prints maybe

25:46.000 --> 25:51.680
higher prints to do a big movie ending number at the end of their wedding maybe include a few

25:51.680 --> 25:59.920
pictures of yourself in the final cut oh boudoir maybe sign them my best my best congrats on the

25:59.920 --> 26:03.680
wedding here's what i looked like on that special day you probably don't know you were busy here

26:03.680 --> 26:08.320
was my reaction you were super busy this is what my face looked like the moment that you said i do

26:08.320 --> 26:13.760
and exchanged vows and gave each other rings and then kissed i know you probably wanted photos of

26:13.760 --> 26:21.200
that instead um but i was a little busy taking pictures of like my face and my reactions to your

26:21.200 --> 26:26.240
eternal love i'm so sorry here's a pretty bird that i found outside sorry about missing the

26:26.240 --> 26:31.840
father daughter it was during the father daughter dance but look at this bird though also i scheduled

26:31.840 --> 26:37.920
some swimsuit photos very taste very tasteful it was during the cake cutting i am very sorry about

26:37.920 --> 26:44.160
this also look at these bae look at these babes though i got them on site at your wedding i got

26:44.160 --> 26:49.600
you a copy of the calendar that i made smoking babes on their wedding days but not their wedding

26:49.600 --> 26:56.160
it was yours smoke of babes on your wedding day they wore your veil i hope that's cool did i ever

26:56.160 --> 27:00.800
tell you guys about this is a bit of a non-sequitur but talking about reactions to ceremonies made me

27:00.800 --> 27:05.760
think about it when rachel and i were shopping around for wedding venues we went to a place

27:05.760 --> 27:12.720
where just the douchiest fucking guy ever was the i guess groundskeeper and proprietor

27:12.720 --> 27:21.200
of this establishment um first of all literally 15 feet as the crow flies from the ceremony spot

27:21.200 --> 27:31.200
they had uh the three crosses like the like the calgary calgary is that right no calgary calgary

27:31.200 --> 27:38.640
like the where the mountain the crucifixion mountain calvary calvary okay calvin uh they

27:38.640 --> 27:43.840
had that right is it which is not ideal right um and then we were like talking to him well that's

27:43.840 --> 27:50.720
a great photo op great great photo op also a chilling chilling reminder as you're walking

27:50.720 --> 27:58.320
down the aisle uh oh man we've had sex so many times already shit um and this dude we were like

27:58.320 --> 28:02.640
talking to him about like what his duties his coordinator would be and he was like during the

28:02.640 --> 28:07.920
ceremony i just sort of stand at the back and what i do is i don't look at the bride when she walks

28:07.920 --> 28:14.000
down the aisle i look at the groom's face and that's how i know and i was like we have to get

28:14.000 --> 28:19.920
in our car we have to get in our car and we have to drive and we have to move away from the state

28:20.880 --> 28:24.800
because that was the creepiest thing a stranger hi i just met you five minutes ago but i'm gonna

28:24.800 --> 28:29.520
scope your face and that's how i'm gonna know whether you love your bride or not what if during

28:29.520 --> 28:34.800
the fucking day like of i'm chasing a mosquito or something and like i'm distracted and he's

28:34.800 --> 28:42.800
like this fool doesn't love this lady objection get the fuck out of my venue true love only true

28:42.800 --> 28:50.560
love only man what a gross gross guy that is not a cool not ideal um anyway you are covered on

28:50.560 --> 28:57.920
photos good news been no photos of course i don't know canada law i this is this is my american

28:57.920 --> 29:02.000
advice i've never been to a canadian wedding maybe it's different i don't know probably not

29:02.640 --> 29:10.160
probably not that different bad news bad news what my wife likes to talk during movies and tv shows

29:11.120 --> 29:18.880
not me but me but i mean yes also me find the character me not me specifically that me the

29:18.880 --> 29:23.760
character i'm playing right now uh and i'm sad to say podcasts that we listen to in the car

29:23.760 --> 29:29.840
including leavers how dare you i've taken to secretly watching my shows late at night when

29:29.840 --> 29:33.520
she's asleep so i don't have to pause and rewind them constantly treating doctor who had the same

29:33.520 --> 29:40.560
privacy and shame one would treat pornography my wife is a lovely person whom i adore so is there

29:40.560 --> 29:46.240
a way i can convince to trick her not to do this and that's from i really don't think i should put

29:46.240 --> 29:52.480
my name here they actually say uh a way i can convince or trick her which man i really wish

29:52.480 --> 29:57.360
every question we got gave us as much rope to hang ourselves on yeah maybe just before you start

29:57.360 --> 30:05.040
watching give her a big mouthful of taffy yeah bad news about your sign off by the way she knows she

30:05.040 --> 30:10.240
knows already wives are much smarter than husbands i put a little peanut butter a little peanut

30:10.240 --> 30:19.760
butter uh maybe a ring pop maybe a ring pop that's a juicy jewel of flavor maybe smoking maybe at

30:19.760 --> 30:29.520
least then you know you could get some listening in in between the drags i man this is like so hard

30:29.520 --> 30:37.360
because what you're basically i mean the basic implication of asking her to curtail this behavior

30:37.360 --> 30:45.520
is like listen i know that you have some things to say to me but i'm trying right now i'm trying

30:45.520 --> 30:50.400
to hear jeff probe describe this challenge right and i don't want to be lost on the rules of this

30:50.400 --> 30:54.960
like meaningless thing you miss the explanation and then they go and then there's a ball and then

30:54.960 --> 30:59.440
they're throwing water to each other and then they have to walk basically at that point like watching

30:59.440 --> 31:06.560
chimps do their regular activities like playing in a in some sort of uh habit it's like you got

31:06.560 --> 31:09.760
to raise the banner you got to use the water in the balls to raise the banner and it's like i don't

31:09.760 --> 31:13.360
know how they use the water in the balls to raise the banner i don't know who's winning i have no

31:13.360 --> 31:19.600
context for who's doing good at this sport because you won't shut your fucking trap that's also what

31:19.600 --> 31:25.600
it's like trying to watch big brother at any point during big brother ever in history yeah you will

31:25.600 --> 31:30.240
never you will never understand if you did not watch it from the very beginning that's just like

31:30.240 --> 31:35.360
war and peace you were never going to catch up with like okay so wait a minute they have to flip

31:35.360 --> 31:40.160
for the head of household and then there's a robot named zane bot that comes in and insults

31:40.160 --> 31:46.720
them and also they're all covered in whipped cream what's happening what's a show man's dying

31:48.640 --> 31:53.840
we've tried to watch that with my in-laws before and we still have not been able to to catch up

31:53.840 --> 32:00.800
with the rules um yeah this sucks i don't know what to tell you because it's like you can't be

32:00.800 --> 32:06.080
like i don't want to hear what you have to say i want to hear what bradley whipford has you can't

32:06.080 --> 32:13.040
say like i treasure more what the virtual man inside my box that i got from best buy

32:13.760 --> 32:20.160
more than i treasure your words my wife i love you you know what you might try and this is

32:20.160 --> 32:27.280
something that like or how we should make this clear this is this is a gender neutral thing

32:27.280 --> 32:36.080
some i yes absolutely the worst uh infractors of this uh this social norm uh that i know are all

32:36.080 --> 32:45.040
dudes yeah do you want to know like moment of clarity my my real advice here uh-oh yep tough

32:45.760 --> 32:50.560
wow i mean here's the thing but like can i can you up can i upgrade that real quick

32:50.560 --> 32:57.200
yeah tough titty okay whoa good addition justin anything you'd like to add i mean i have some

32:57.200 --> 33:03.600
actual good advice but go ahead no but here's my advice is you you gotta you can't let it bother

33:03.600 --> 33:09.280
you you have to do it and enjoy spending time with your significant other and realize it's

33:09.280 --> 33:15.440
not about your enjoyment of the uh media anymore it's about spending the time together listening

33:15.440 --> 33:21.520
to the thing and then if you want to do it again later um without her so that you can get a full

33:21.520 --> 33:31.200
a double dip a director's cut go for it but you can't bonus content yeah but you can't tell her

33:31.200 --> 33:35.760
to shut it because what you're saying well don't you wouldn't tell her to shut it travis i don't

33:35.760 --> 33:40.320
think that if he was going to find a way to do this he'd i don't think he would go hey real quick

33:40.320 --> 33:45.520
hey real quick shut it thanks just describing the challenge can you shut it i'm not saying i'm

33:45.520 --> 33:53.760
perfect my single brother of you i i two things first off travis does have some grain of truth

33:53.760 --> 33:59.200
inside what he's saying in that if you're watching tv it should be a communal activity you're never

33:59.200 --> 34:06.000
gonna you know if you both feel like like paying really close attention then find a show that you

34:06.000 --> 34:10.960
know you do that if you want a show where you're just gonna like not just chat all the way through

34:10.960 --> 34:15.520
it there are shows that are great for that too that's what reality television's for oh my god

34:15.520 --> 34:20.560
the bachelor was made for that like the bachelor literally the people i watch that show with like

34:20.560 --> 34:26.160
we talk constantly because usually we drain two bottles of red wine while watching it uh so that's

34:26.160 --> 34:31.280
not like that's not that far off i mean i think uh usually you might be able to get a sense maybe

34:31.280 --> 34:35.760
of like if if there's a time when the two of you are going to want to watch a show and chat through

34:35.760 --> 34:39.280
it or watch show and focus on the other thing i would say is this is something that i was really

34:39.280 --> 34:46.960
bad about early in my marriage is that like i would turn the tv on as soon as we sat down to eat

34:46.960 --> 34:54.000
dinner and then it would just stay on permanently and sydney and i would talk a lot through tv shows

34:54.000 --> 34:58.080
and it initially bugged me but then i realized that like that was the only time the two of us

34:58.080 --> 35:07.200
were sitting together was that the tv was on so if you take some time and like have like just made

35:07.200 --> 35:12.240
more time to actually talk and you know talk about what's going on in her life and you know do that

35:12.240 --> 35:18.640
great communication that makes relationships so great then uh you know it may not be something

35:18.640 --> 35:24.000
where you know she may be all talked out you may be all talked out i'm saying she again to

35:24.000 --> 35:29.840
re-emphasize we're specifically answering this person's question this is not a gender issue

35:31.120 --> 35:37.840
it's not um because sometimes i get talky and sydney gets irritated at me it's usually during

35:37.840 --> 35:42.800
reality tv shows where she'll get like deep into something i'm like i listen i'm just just i don't

35:42.800 --> 35:48.080
i want her to say yes to some dress sure but i can't really focus on individual dresses they're

35:48.080 --> 35:53.440
kind of blurring together this season of the bachelor was especially perfect for it um because

35:53.440 --> 35:59.760
not because juan pablo english was his uh second or third language uh but because he was terrible

36:00.320 --> 36:07.840
and didn't some like have a conversation with any of the 27 women that he sampled

36:07.840 --> 36:13.840
during that show sampled is that the right verb sampled is the appropriate how do you say sampled

36:13.840 --> 36:22.480
uh you guys want yahoo yes please uh okay i said yes please okay uh this yahoo was

36:22.480 --> 36:26.320
sent in by jordan benner thank you jordan it's by yahoo answers user carmen who asks

36:27.920 --> 36:34.640
how could i mail fried chicken oh if you figure it out my friend would like some chick filet but

36:34.640 --> 36:42.080
the nearest estates away uh how could i keep the chicken healthy parentheses frozen in the mail

36:42.080 --> 36:53.200
oh uh thanks for your help there's real answers to this but what's the real like dry ice i mean

36:53.200 --> 36:58.720
you freeze it and then there's like like cooler boxes you could ship stuff in that's how they

36:58.720 --> 37:03.840
ship like frozen omaha steaks and stuff i mean fried fried chicken proper on the bone would hold

37:03.840 --> 37:09.440
like that's that's good picnic food yum yum i don't think a fucking sloppy pickle chick filet sammy

37:09.440 --> 37:13.920
is gonna like and that's the other problem is it's not coming frozen you're gonna buy it

37:13.920 --> 37:20.000
made and hot from the store and then freeze it and then ship it i mean i don't think that that

37:20.000 --> 37:24.480
that temperature temperature yo-yo is not gonna you're not gonna come out on the winning end oh

37:24.480 --> 37:30.080
god no how boner is this person for some chick filet though because you gotta think like once

37:30.080 --> 37:36.080
you add dry ice there you're gonna want to do two day shipping at the very most right you don't want

37:36.080 --> 37:39.840
to go any longer than you have to overnight you gotta overnight you have to hire an organ courier

37:39.840 --> 37:46.960
to get it to you exactly my friend's gonna die if he doesn't give this chick filet transplant

37:46.960 --> 37:53.440
go go go of all the of i mean do you want me to really fucking set this i doubt this person's

37:53.440 --> 37:57.600
listening but the easy solution is you can make this shit at home yourself and it's the easiest

37:58.160 --> 38:03.840
you know the secret marinate that chicken in pickle juice for like a day and then you cook it

38:03.840 --> 38:10.560
whoa what's up tasty homophobia come in oh and then you just like yell some brutal fred felps

38:10.560 --> 38:17.440
shit at it oh yeah maybe like i mean obviously option one is like don't ever buy you flay i mean

38:17.440 --> 38:22.240

38:22.240 --> 38:27.120

40:21.600 --> 40:27.920

40:33.440 --> 40:38.000
uh well okay no there's the flag store which i took you guys to there's sort of like a beverage

40:38.000 --> 40:44.320
depot uh they have it but it's not like i'm pretty sure that shit is strictly in the carolinas and

40:44.320 --> 40:50.080
georgia and florida if you live there like can you send us some cheer wine what is the address

40:50.080 --> 40:55.120

40:55.120 --> 40:59.760
send like full calorie cheer wine because i'll never drink that that's sugar it's all sugar

40:59.760 --> 41:06.880
i need diet cheer wine anyway uh yeah that is that those are my two i guess i like i like a nice bowl

41:06.880 --> 41:12.080
of skyline chili there's probably some i'm forgetting i mean we don't have a a wide array of

41:12.640 --> 41:19.120
food options here we're getting a chipotle whoa getting two chipolas actually where's the chipotle

41:19.120 --> 41:24.480

the mall two simul simul chipotles we got panera we got chipotle highington city on the grow yeah

41:31.920 --> 41:38.080
we got panera we got all the like mainstays all the all the biggies there's a tgi friday's

41:38.080 --> 41:43.840
you do have sort of a vacation spot you do have all the biggies got all the biggies because your

41:43.840 --> 41:50.320
state your state uh wrestles with obesity the bad news is i'm never going to be able to afford

41:50.320 --> 41:55.200
uh all these delights that i want to purchase because i don't have enough money if only there

41:55.200 --> 42:00.720
was a way that i could get more of it do you guys have any suggestions steal it i know our listeners

42:00.720 --> 42:06.400
at home are thinking i just listened to these three dudes talk about the location of new chipotles

42:06.400 --> 42:13.040
in a town i'll never go to how can i support how can i support this how can i become a patron of

42:13.040 --> 42:19.360
this specific type of art uh there's good news there's a it's a because it's max fun drive time

42:19.360 --> 42:29.200
uh now what what specifically does does your money go to well it goes to us uh we get uh

42:29.200 --> 42:35.040
money and uh but more importantly other people get money and everybody gets money and and when

42:35.040 --> 42:40.480
they get that money it lets them make this content like it's not just like i'm gonna line my wallet

42:40.480 --> 42:47.120
it lets us you know make time in our day and our schedules to record the show and get new equipment

42:47.120 --> 42:51.760
that's huge i mean really that's a it's a great point justin because the frequency with which

42:52.400 --> 42:58.720
you know new content is uploaded uh to max fun it's mostly weekly like that's insane and the

42:58.720 --> 43:04.240
way that we're able to do that is because you know the we're able to be paid to do it it's a job

43:04.880 --> 43:11.760
and so you get consistent uh i don't know about consistent no inconsistent entertainment

43:11.760 --> 43:16.480
drop some fucking bricks i think my slogan for my brother my brother and me would be

43:16.480 --> 43:22.960
inconsistent entertainment consistently delivered like you definitely get it you definitely get

43:22.960 --> 43:26.400
some no we do buy new equipment like i said we bought try every new laptop earlier this year

43:26.400 --> 43:31.920
justin you got that uh audio mixing board which is why your fucking tones sound so dulcet now

43:32.560 --> 43:40.960
yeah um no joke so we get to do stuff like that uh mostly it's what i love is that like our our

43:40.960 --> 43:46.240
the network has been expanding so rapidly over especially over the past couple years

43:46.880 --> 43:54.080
uh earlier this year we added oh no ross and carrie we added lady the lady the goose down

43:54.960 --> 44:01.200
uh we added the revamped international waters uh revamped international we we added fucking

44:01.200 --> 44:08.560
uh song exploder which is absolutely incredible if you're not listening to it uh and then i mean

44:08.560 --> 44:17.280
last year was what saw bones one bad mother um wham bam pow wham pam pow that like it's these

44:17.280 --> 44:22.480
are like i i listen to most of the shows on the network on a weekly basis like when i think about

44:23.280 --> 44:29.920
how much time i spend listening to our podcasts like i don't know if you're in the same same boat

44:29.920 --> 44:37.200
i think as a as an effort or as a as a value proposition i almost said effort values which

44:37.200 --> 44:43.280
is like a pokemon mechanic is probably not um but that's why i mean that's why we're all donors i

44:43.280 --> 44:47.760
donate because i support the work that we do and i like yeah all three of us are donors which i

rocket engraved highball glasses so go do that right yes i'm like a uh i i am a full-time baller

46:19.840 --> 46:24.080
i guess is how you would describe me i ball so hard i've got a broke clock

46:24.080 --> 46:29.520
okay that makes sense uh a second hand that don't tick tock i've always wondered about that lyric

46:29.520 --> 46:37.360
like why why does him having a broken piece of electronics like like modify how hard he balls

46:37.360 --> 46:41.760
like i have a clock because he balls all the time because he's waiting for it to hit five o'clock so

46:41.760 --> 46:46.240
you stop balling and go home to his wife punch his pocket broken and he's stuck at work oh man

46:46.240 --> 46:51.040
he's perpetually stuck at like 4 33 like god damn it where's this taking an end i've been

46:51.040 --> 46:57.680
balling for seven years now i'm i'm tired i'm thirsty i haven't sat down i don't know i have

46:57.680 --> 47:02.160
lots of clocks at work and i think that makes me ball a little bit harder because i know what time

47:02.160 --> 47:07.680

we don't want to get the pigs into this uh maximumfund.org forward slash donate go there

48:22.000 --> 48:30.320
right now please help us thank you so much here's another question hi guys hey i'm a 22 year old lady

48:30.320 --> 48:38.240
with a german oh not german gentleman friend what's up hi guys i'm a 22 year old lady with a

48:38.240 --> 48:43.760
gentleman friend who i'd like to start calling my boyfriend i think justin wishes you'd start

48:43.760 --> 48:49.280
calling him that too so he could read less words so it'll be a little easier to say thank you

48:49.280 --> 48:54.560
we've known each other for a few years but just recently have been hanging out and basically dating

48:55.280 --> 48:59.440
how can i bring up this conversation without making him feel like he's being forced to make

48:59.440 --> 49:06.800
this thing we're doing official that's from stumped in stump town thank you stumped for taking a swing

49:07.360 --> 49:13.600
at putting in a fun name i've seen that sort of on the decline and we really appreciate it when you

49:13.600 --> 49:18.640
actually do that because it makes us feel like dear abby my concern stumped is that you're using

49:18.640 --> 49:25.200
a lot of qualifying words like basically dating and it just uh this kind of seems like one of

49:25.200 --> 49:30.320
those if you have to ask then it's probably it probably i mean yeah that's kind of my take on it

49:30.320 --> 49:35.200
like if you don't feel comfortable doing it it's not the right time yet but like i mean it might

49:35.200 --> 49:40.720
be the right time and just this person is dragging their feet a little bit which uh if that is the

49:40.720 --> 49:46.080
case then there i don't think there is a way to not make them feel like they're being forced

49:47.680 --> 49:52.960
i don't know why does it matter what you label it why do we have to label this i'm saying like

49:52.960 --> 49:58.160
if you're enjoying their time and you're happy with how things are going let it happen naturally

49:58.160 --> 50:04.000
and don't don't try to find the right time the right time will come whoa okay but no but just

50:04.000 --> 50:08.880
from a from a fucking scientific cat griffin i just fucking dropped an awesome like knowledge

50:08.880 --> 50:15.680
bomb and i mean you didn't you dropped a fucking live journal i said i did like a linen and people

50:15.680 --> 50:21.840
are gonna quote it okay um what if this person like what if you're hanging out with this person

50:21.840 --> 50:27.280
you walk up to somebody that you know and they know how do you introduce them i don't know if

50:27.280 --> 50:31.840
you guys have ever seen that's awkward and i get not wanting to deal with i don't know if you guys

50:31.840 --> 50:36.720
have ever been in that situation in real life it doesn't just only happen in movies it happens in

50:36.720 --> 50:44.080
real life and guess what it fucking stinks it stinks like shit to be in that scenario

50:45.360 --> 50:49.760
i think you gotta make the direct approach and say listen when we go places i'm really

50:49.760 --> 50:53.840
tired of awkward conversations can we just say we're boyfriend girlfriend it's like not like

50:53.840 --> 50:58.480
we're getting married it's just a label is that cool with you i actually don't hate that but don't

50:58.480 --> 51:06.000
say the word married in there at all okay no reason to up the ante anymore than it is already

51:06.000 --> 51:13.040
going to be upped just i mean here's a i kind of feel like the most important thing and like you'll

51:13.040 --> 51:18.400
hear you'll hear this over and over again it's like a platitude but it is legitimately true

51:18.400 --> 51:24.160
true that the most important thing you can have in any relationship new or old is butt sex

51:25.680 --> 51:34.560
what sex sorry did you say i i kind of tuned out what were you unless this person has a long butt

51:34.560 --> 51:44.160
and then that is physically impossible or at least exhausting so butt sex but also second to as

51:44.160 --> 51:51.680
travis said butt sex it's just trying to up the uh just trying to up the adult quotient here uh

51:51.680 --> 51:59.600
communication talking honestly like if this is an honest if this is a big deal to you for reasons

51:59.600 --> 52:06.240
that are not going to be intimidating then there's no reason for you to to not be honest like this

52:06.240 --> 52:11.360
is an awkward thing and i kind of feel like things have been going well you know are we

52:11.360 --> 52:15.360
date like are we exclusively dating my new girlfriend my are you my boyfriend

52:16.000 --> 52:22.400
it's weird introducing you to people it's kind of a weird thing um i do wish how long has this

52:22.400 --> 52:31.520
been going on hanging out and oh man that basically dating see that's where i think

52:31.520 --> 52:37.760
step one basically hey are we dating oh yeah basically dating is like weird does that mean

52:37.760 --> 52:44.320

know enough about your stitch i'm sorry this yeah this is a really this is a really tough

53:06.640 --> 53:12.080
needle to thread i think that uh if you if you initiate the conversation though i mean

53:12.800 --> 53:16.320
the worst case scenario is that you scare them off and you ruin the whole thing

53:16.320 --> 53:24.000
great great great great great we don't really we're not really that good at advice um you guys

53:24.000 --> 53:29.600
wanna yahoo or should uh no read this next question because it's great okay i just broke up with my

53:29.600 --> 53:35.120
girlfriend because the mcroy by the way just gave me the shittiest advice before i broke up with her

53:35.120 --> 53:40.240
i bought her a chocolate heart which i didn't end up giving to her my question what i do with

53:40.240 --> 53:48.880
this heart can i eat it should i give it to her what are you talking about i can't return it was

53:48.880 --> 53:57.760
a discount item i can tell that i can't believe that relationship didn't work out corollary

53:57.760 --> 54:03.440
question i might be getting back together with my ex can i give it to her holy shit hold on wait

54:03.440 --> 54:08.800

54:08.800 --> 54:17.280
ex separate ex this is signed best dude ever apparently i mean if it let's not rush into this

54:17.280 --> 54:25.120
one okay okay can you eat the chocolate heart yeah i would say yes but only if you need it

54:25.120 --> 54:31.200
like if you need it to get through this breakup i think you are completely within your rights to

54:31.200 --> 54:38.640
like i i feel like breaking up with somebody is basically the best kind of like sad thing that

54:38.640 --> 54:45.440
can happen to you personally because it's not the end of the world and it's not going to do you any

54:45.440 --> 54:52.400
long-term harm it's just sad in like a very sort of healthy way so i think the best kind of sad

54:52.400 --> 54:57.200
thing that could happen to you is that you're too good at sex and people give you too much money to

54:57.200 --> 55:01.280
try to cope with it and you don't know how to deal with all the pressure of being super rich

55:01.280 --> 55:05.680
and super good at sex the saddest the best sad thing that could happen to you is that you're

55:05.680 --> 55:14.080
bruno mars he cries himself to sleep every night singing a low and mournful song so you can eat it

55:14.080 --> 55:19.760
right oh that's i would peep i would fucking peep the expiration date on that bear discount

55:19.760 --> 55:25.360
dairy product though i would check out when that if possible it would be great to eat it in front

55:25.360 --> 55:31.920
of your most recent ex-girlfriend this is what you did to me symbolically speaking you're not

55:31.920 --> 55:37.280

55:37.280 --> 55:47.840

55:47.840 --> 55:56.000
few hours to let us try please help me i'm lost um don't give it to her anyway don't give it to

55:56.000 --> 56:00.400
someone else don't give it to your ex be careful about eating it maybe maybe just bury it put it

56:00.400 --> 56:06.400
in your bread box forget about it find it again in the year you don't really have eaten bags

56:06.400 --> 56:12.800
of chex wigs i have my bread box it's guys it's like a fucking museum it's the create i have no

56:12.800 --> 56:18.000
idea why you still have all those things i like here's how it normally shakes out or on a road

56:18.000 --> 56:23.360
trip for some reason when i'm at a gas station on a road trip i want chex mix it seems like

56:23.360 --> 56:28.160
the best overall option that are corn nuts and then i'll eat half the bag and like when i'm at

56:28.160 --> 56:34.800
home though i'm never feeling like i'm gonna eat some chex mix um this stuff stays good forever

56:34.800 --> 56:42.640
basically done it's indestructible um and i i have a lot of it a lot of half-eaten bags of chex mix what

56:42.640 --> 56:47.200
are we talking about um i mean we were helping this person but if you want to keep talking about

56:47.200 --> 56:55.040
the things that you have in your bread box don't give it to your ex that is just i mean don't give

56:55.040 --> 56:59.680
it to your dog it'll die yeah don't give her your dog it'll die so many don't give it to your ex

56:59.680 --> 57:05.280
she'll kill you it's like not even uh there's no there's nothing you can do with this heart i'm

57:05.280 --> 57:09.120
sorry now i understand your question i'm sorry i mocked you there's nothing you could do with it

57:09.120 --> 57:15.120
throwing it away would be like that sounds like a palatable option or so does eating it but like

57:15.120 --> 57:21.680
actually put yourself in that metaphorical head space right so like bend bend folds evaporated

57:21.680 --> 57:26.800
playing over your home stereo and you're like sadly breaking off pieces of a chocolate heart

57:26.800 --> 57:32.000
like just like little oh yeah saliva makes with chocolate dripping down your chin oh god here's

57:32.000 --> 57:38.240
what you have to do you gotta lean into it you gotta put it in a skillet and watch it oh shit

57:38.240 --> 57:42.080
that's good whatever you do just make sure you don't throw the entire package away without

57:42.080 --> 57:47.840
bend folds evaporated plain you gotta go one drippy drop at a time you gotta really savor

57:47.840 --> 57:53.040
the flavor of your misery don't save it the flavor of the chocolate savor the symbolism

57:53.040 --> 57:57.280
um there's nothing you could do with this chocolate you have to you have to move

57:58.480 --> 58:04.240
it's the chocolate heart's house now that's where the chocolate there's nothing that can

58:04.240 --> 58:09.280
happen to this heart that wouldn't be sad skeet shooting maybe that might be tight how aerodynamic

58:09.280 --> 58:18.080

we will find our way through it no i'll just talk about it without listening like i normally do

58:53.840 --> 59:00.640
fantastic uh why did i cry during click it's a comedy but i cried during his heart attack and

59:00.640 --> 59:07.360
when he died at the end what i don't get travis i fucking warned you uh i don't get it you don't

59:07.360 --> 59:14.160
cry during comedies you laugh that's how adam sandler fucking does it though isn't it he fucking

59:14.160 --> 59:17.280
gets you in the end you're like i can't wait to watch this adam sandler movie it's gonna be a

59:17.280 --> 59:23.280
laugh riot what's it called spanglish and then you get to the end you're like it's like the end

59:23.280 --> 59:29.520
of billy madison when he has a heart attack he has he's all like rosebud when you sit when you

59:29.520 --> 59:35.120
saw i now pronounce you dave and brandon and then at the end it's like i thought this movie was gonna

59:35.120 --> 59:42.000
be hateful towards the gay community and it absolutely was but it had it kind of had tried

59:42.000 --> 59:48.640
to do a message there at the end i can't because i watched it i can't believe i spent my money on

59:48.640 --> 59:54.640
that all right jack and jill when he has a heart attack and dies there's two different characters

59:54.640 --> 01:00:00.640
at the same time and the last shot is them lying on the floor reaching out to each other trying

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.720
to touch each other to connect one more time it was in a movie for the afterlife alone he was in

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:10.000
that motherfucker was in a movie called funny people it was anything but it was all tears

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.880
tears teary-eyed people he was great in steel magnolias though oh yeah so funny dude that was

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:21.840
funny that was funny you know what other adam sandler movies are like tell us such talk all

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:27.280
about it i like 50 first dates i thought it was romantic and sweet i like anytime him and that

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:32.720
drew barrymore can get together sure i didn't like the part at the end when she when he's on

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:39.200
a respirator and she pulls his plug and she's like this was our 50th date and he dies and then she

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:45.520
immediately forgets everything about him it would be good if the movie's called 50 first dates one

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:54.240
last date that movie is very sad travis brought up 50 first dates but that's probably the sad

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:03.280
who is this baby it's my what sorry my child that i have so they don't show you is like the

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:08.960
horrifying like alien abduction moment when she wakes up and she's pregnant oh my god travis you're

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.320
right like she hasn't watched the video yet she doesn't know what's up she's just woken up and

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.040
there's a baby inside her all of a sudden how about how about we flash forward another five years

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.240
when you try to explain to your four-year-old why they have to meet their mommy every day

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:28.880
why doesn't she are you sure she doesn't you have a good excuse for missing her soccer game i guess

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.720
terrible mom what about when the harry potter movies came out there's not enough hours in the

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:38.800
day to watch sorcerer's stone then chamber of secrets and then prisoner of azkaban and then

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:44.240
gobble of fire and then order of the phoenix and then half blood prince and then oh i definitely

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:49.040
hallows part one and then definitely hallows part two comes out like there's not that's like 28

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.280
hours already to get caught up in order to see the second part like that yeah we don't even

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:58.320
deal with the fact in 50 first dates that she hasn't read a book since she was like 16

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.760
yeah or whatever you know like she can't get even she reasonable she forgets what was in it

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.840
she doesn't know who's president every morning she wakes up and is shocked that we have a black

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.800
president she's gonna she's gonna oh that people are gonna think she's a racist that's an undercurrent

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:18.720
in that film is that drew Barrymore is just a fucking raging bigot every morning she's gonna

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:24.320
go into office at her office and say uh can you guys believe we have a black president and then

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:29.840
everyone's gonna be like again she's on this again every day she talks about yeah right let me see

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:37.280
that birth certificate maybe like you did you fucking oh my god you're the worst the good news

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:46.960
is she gets watched gang up style every day for the first time that's uplifting oh boy she would

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:53.040
be amazing like every every day in your office she's like no no no you have to watch the little

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.280
kid his name is charlie and his little baby brother bites his finger just chill on it for

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:04.960
a second wait till you wait for the moment um that was a pretty good bit i thought or we talked about

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:10.560
50 first dates for a while yep here's the thing we discover we try to do extra long episodes

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:17.280
when we uh have a pledge drive going on but we apparently around an hour our brains literally

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.680
run out well we didn't even address the subject matter of this question which is why did i cry

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:27.760
during click i think it really is part of fucking adam sandler's formula you make him laugh for 45

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:33.920
minutes and then you give him 15 minutes of crying and then usually it resolves on a uh you know a

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:39.680
bright note i don't know if you guys have seen click he doesn't have a he doesn't actually die

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:46.080
at the end god damn it griffin do you think this person just like saw adam sandler die

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:56.720
i was like too sad stop eject burn i'm gonna use my own remote stop it stop adam sandler's pain

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:02.160
i have to stop the pain that's a good reminder that like your remote at home may not control

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.720
your entire life but it can't control how much of an adam sandler movie you have to watch

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.800
which is basically the most important thing in your life can i ask you a quick question justin

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:17.200
yeah yeah i thought grown-ups 2 is better than the original 2 yes you don't even have to ask

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:23.920
but what's the question no that was it you got it okay good uh there's oh i'm sorry no my question

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.920
was what the fuck have you ever done to make fun of adam sandler oh that's right that was the

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:34.880
question i meant to ask who the fuck are you okay go on with the next question i listen i you don't

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.200
want to get started on this with me because if we step outside the bit you don't want to come

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:45.920
outside the bit you don't want to see my hand where i hit me at because i did i did watch

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:54.400
you don't mess with the zoe han on pay-per-view tv i did what sir under what auspices sir under

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:59.120
what dress i was saying you don't want to get into this conversation because you will lose

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:03.680
adam sandler will literally call me on my cell phone to thank me for being such a great fan of his

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:11.600
i don't mean the guy has his moments i i get you know what it was sometimes i get obsessed with

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:19.680
knowing how bad something is it's not like i watch it for fun but like i can't fathom for for

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:27.200
instance i have watched the scene in master of disguise when pistachio disguise he dresses as a

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:33.360
turtle and tries to get into the turtle club probably 50 times like no exaggeration probably 50

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:40.800
times and i i have always wanted to actually sit down and watch that movie because if that is like

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:49.440
the scene how could this film get from beginning that was you're saying that was the fucking hook

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:54.480
like that was the scene that they built the rest of the film around it was the the comedy

01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:02.640
was the the comedy trailer yeah yeah no yeah do you think that there are people in this world

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:08.240
that have only seen adam sandler and punch drunk love and if you were to show them like happy

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:13.680
gilmore it would just blow their fucking minds like they were saying you're going adam sandler

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:19.680
is an amazing dramatic actor are there people who saw punch drunk love who thought that adam

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:25.200
sailor is an amazing dramatic actor well if you watch it on shrooms it's an amazing experience

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:32.640
the colors on the the between the scenes were amazing dramatic actors there is a lady who is

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:37.920
the cafeteria cashier at the location i work at she is constantly trying to hook me up with another

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:43.680
girl who works in a different department with comments like she's a nice girl and you guys

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:49.840
look good together now who she is starting who were you just doing there that's uh jackie oh

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:57.840

feel extremely guilty that i haven't done anything yet i work close to 70 hours per week and i'm a

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:14.800
part-time student in college so clearly i don't have time uh for any form of relationships brothers

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:20.480

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:40.480
you fall hit your head get some sort of mild contusion i think that's what a contusion is

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:46.080
and then forget and then like wake up a new person basically who's experiencing your life

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:52.960
for the first time and realize that love is the most important thing in your life or tell these

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:12.480

just sucks like why is it such a big deal i mean here's the best advice i can give you and that's

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:02.160
work out of your home i i i used to run into situations like this so it made me uncomfortable

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:06.000
every day and now i start working my home and nobody bothers me more you know how much i'd love

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.320
for somebody to bother me about somebody who works in a different department there is no one in any

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:16.160
other departments i'm at my house you are so like a shining like scene in which justin enters a

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:22.320
cafeteria he never knew was in his house and the cafeteria lady behind the counter you've been here

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:27.600
all ready for your ready for your pudding i has this has the has the cafeteria worker

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:32.720
keyed in the other person to the fact that she's trying to hook you two up

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.520
man i hope so because one of the things this person asks about is how to tell the other girl

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.480
see that's the thing that's what it makes it sound like it makes it sound like this cafeteria

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:43.760
worker was like hey i have this girl she's really nice i think you guys should get together and you

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:48.800
said oh i don't know anyway thanks for the pudding this is the extent of what i want our transactions

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:54.160
to be from this point out thanks bye uh and then this person took it upon themselves to go talk to

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:58.880
the other person say hey trying to hook you up with this other guy isn't that a great idea like

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:05.200
that person is the worst person i don't understand good friend i don't understand why this is making

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:10.000
you so angry because you are literally like i mean it seems pretty benign she's just trying to

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.200
have some fun past the time she's having fun at your fucking expense though it's momentarily

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:20.720
awkward like why can't this be a cute little change because i've actually been in this situation

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:26.800
before where when i worked at sears the there's a girl that i worked with me that we were good

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:32.880
friends i did in the land's end department what's up ladies um travis you're married there's this

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:38.560
girl that are what you're married no i'm just letting ladies know that i can hook them up with

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:43.600
the finest lands in fashions there's this girl that uh she and i got along well and we were

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:49.440
good friends and our boss started like saying stuff like you guys would be really cute together

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:55.680
you got have you unacceptable okay great and then it escalated to a point where she would do it when

01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:01.600
we were like in the same area so like to both of us have you guys ever thought about going out have

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:09.600
you guys it's like this is really awful and like it was very atrocious it was pretty horrible it

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:14.240
went from being like the benign like elbowing like hey have you thought about asking out what's her

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:24.000
face to like you two you should do it it is so hard to find a person that you get along with in

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.600
that special way you have to get along with somebody to form like a a relationship with

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:36.080
them on this level it's so fucking difficult you don't need like people just like chucking false

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:45.040
flags at you on the daily on the daily reg that sucks yeah maybe you here's the problem with the

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:50.560
tables in this situation is that they're facing the wrong direction and when that's the case

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:56.560
there's only one thing you can do do you know what that is griffin i know you turn the tables

01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:01.360
oh okay you say to her i was confused about the whole table thing at first because it's like a

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:07.200
confusing thing it's like a metaphor kind of like so you start serving her food no you say hey listen

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:14.560
chuck the guy who makes hamburger patties is giving out and that's a little on the nose

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:19.520
what why okay you think there's a guy you think this cafeteria is well off enough that they can

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:27.360
hire a fucking patty technician not only got his name to chuck okay so you know i've got this

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:34.960
friend his name is hamburger brothy the soup guy has been giving you the eye and free because he's

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.320
only got one of them he's only got one the other fell into soup it was the most delicious soup this

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:47.360
person ever tasted it made everybody love human flesh everybody tried the eyeball soup but he

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:54.560
could never replicate it until the one day that he did this summer adam sandler is the blind man

01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:01.920
wait what was your title brothy the blind okay mine was no i'd soup monster okay they're both

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:06.640
functional it's just a different tone sure depends on if you get a robert rodriguez or like let's

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:11.520
bounce it off marketing and we'll see like which one has more brand brand appeal i love it i think

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:15.040
no i'd soup monster has a little bit better pop i think it'll make a way better hashtag

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:22.320
um here's my hashtag for the week you want to know what it is max fun drive one last time before we

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:28.400
let you go we want to ask you to go to maximum fun org forward slash donate and pledge at one of

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:33.360
those levels if you're a returning donor up it just a little bit and it would mean the world to

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:39.360
us and you'll get shit if you do that you also get this is a network that is on it's sort of

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:44.480
unprecedented you know it is it is a people say you can't make money with podcasts and you can't

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:51.520
support podcasts and we are trying to prove people wrong uh every every year by putting out really

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:58.080
great content that is only exists because you want it to you it only exists because you like it and

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:05.120
you pay to keep it on the air um and on the on the metaphorical air as it were um and that is

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:13.280
and that is personally really uh it's it's it means a lot it's also like what i love so much

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:21.360
about about this this sort of community uh so justin our other job is in the video game community

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:26.000
which at times some of like the worst elements of that community can come out and make things

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:33.280
sort of terrible um it's obviously it's not all bad but the there there is like the a pretty um

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:40.000
um a large contingent of negative people in that and i think that's not just just strictly video

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.240
games i think that's like internet wide like twitter has just been bumming me out on the rag

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:52.480
lately uh of just like a lot of negative nellys and maximum fun not only is our like entire

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:59.760
community like a hundred percent of the time basically positive and like rad and like always

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.080
having great conversations on on twitter and in the forums and being just like super cool

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:12.800
to each other i think the shows themselves represent sort of a a non-ironic like well

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:19.680
intentioned form of entertainment that i think is super super rare yes we have some fun at adam

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:28.720
sandler's expense and yes occasionally we turn our um i guess you would call it spite on to um

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:34.800
people like i don't jugglers or french stewart but for the most part i think french jugglers or

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:40.960
french stewart when he's juggling um i think for the most part like we're we're pretty positive and

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:45.920
pretty just like happy people and i think that the shows on the network sort of reflect that

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:51.440
and that's what i think is so rare is like we're not just outwardly being shitty to everyone and

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:58.880
hoping that funny stuff happens sometimes like i feel like this sort of the max fun motto is is one

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:14.400
of of positivity and what is that motto um it's a goose here um so if you can it really it don't

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:19.280
don't wait for somebody else to do it join the family we're seeing now just before the episode

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:24.880
ends pretend pretend we're your your preacher we're standing up waiting for you i think i just

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:28.480
