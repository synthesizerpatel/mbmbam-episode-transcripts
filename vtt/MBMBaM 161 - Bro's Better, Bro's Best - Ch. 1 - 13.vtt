now

02:52.320 --> 02:54.920
Speaking of questions this one comes from Yahoo

02:54.920 --> 03:02.200
The question is what is the chord progression during the intro of the ABC series Greek?

03:06.160 --> 03:07.960
Scrappy buns Jones

03:07.960 --> 03:13.080
How many times a week should I shampoo my hair? I'm currently on a wash thrice

03:13.880 --> 03:18.680
Shampoo every third wash cycle. Okay, we're gonna get just real talk here

03:19.440 --> 03:21.600
Yeah, you just entered into our wheelhouse

03:21.600 --> 03:25.060
This is it listen this is a matter of some debate for men of dry hair

03:25.240 --> 03:28.520
Let me open up let me open up by saying I didn't know like

03:28.800 --> 03:31.760
this is one of those many many things that I as a

03:32.280 --> 03:39.340
22 year old adult should should know and and incorporate in my life, but I shampoo my hair every time I get

03:41.400 --> 03:49.000
That's why you've got that hair like you have I shouldn't be you're having an awakening guys. It's our first awakening I

03:49.000 --> 03:53.400
I feel like when I don't you're listening to awakenings with Justin Travis

03:53.400 --> 03:57.120
I think I feel like I'm getting dirty like if I don't do it

03:57.120 --> 04:02.400
I feel dirty is the natural oils that your scalp produces makes your hair look look

04:03.160 --> 04:09.800
Think of it from like a caveman era your body biologically wants your hair to look better. It's trying to make your hair look better

04:09.800 --> 04:17.160
It's doing what it can to help you and you like the 3d a rotation a day rotation. I am down now sometimes

04:17.160 --> 04:23.680
What's the problem? You got to get in there on that third day with a real hard scrub or your Scouts gonna go to shit?

04:26.680 --> 04:31.240
When my hair gets longer, and I know I'm running my hands through it a lot and getting that real gross

04:31.240 --> 04:33.720
I'll do it two or two day rotation sir

04:33.720 --> 04:39.200
Yeah, we've interviewed use a lot of products one day you and you got to get away from that feeling

04:39.560 --> 04:41.840
There's one unsolved mystery here

04:41.840 --> 04:48.640
Okay, so you guys obviously know more about this thing than I do but if you don't shampoo your hair

04:49.320 --> 04:56.080
Then how are you supposed to put shampoo in your hair and let the suds run down and then just use those suds as soap

04:58.560 --> 05:00.560
Great question

05:02.560 --> 05:09.840
You're telling me that I shouldn't use soap is what I'm hearing except for every Wednesday and Saturday I

05:09.840 --> 05:16.800
I think that this grooming section. I'm gonna has taken a weird turn where it's like more about

05:18.040 --> 05:23.840
Just had a terrible good life. It's weird. It started out. It's about one thing. That's kind of depressing

05:23.840 --> 05:28.440
I'm as clean as a motherfucker, but I do it in suspect ways

05:29.000 --> 05:30.440
Yeah

05:30.440 --> 05:32.160
Another thing you can do is um

05:32.160 --> 05:36.880
Do you guys you guys remember when you were younger and you go like on a first date with somebody and you'd be in?

05:36.880 --> 05:40.400
The movie theater and it would take you like the entire two hour

05:41.240 --> 05:44.280
Movie to get up the courage to like hold their hand

05:44.280 --> 05:47.280
And so the entire time like your hand is kind of slowly

05:47.880 --> 05:54.120
Yeah, and it's all exciting and scary. What you can do is do that with the stranger sitting next to you

05:55.320 --> 05:59.640
Right and have it like stretch it out for the entire like if you're flying east to west coast

05:59.640 --> 06:01.640
It's like a unit six hour, right?

06:01.640 --> 06:08.360
So just take six hours and very slowly just have this campaign of of just no finger by finger

06:08.480 --> 06:10.480
Just move you'll be so distracted

06:10.880 --> 06:15.120
You'll be so distracted so scared and like maybe maybe

06:16.520 --> 06:18.080
Maybe

06:18.080 --> 06:23.320
You know, maybe that large drill sergeant type sitting in 17 be made us be your special somebody

06:24.160 --> 06:29.320
Right. Yeah, and if not, like even if you get shot down you just your your fights done

06:29.320 --> 06:32.440
Take a chance. You know, I was reading my cosmo like I do

06:32.440 --> 06:35.400
It's what I do and I found some great advice for the ladies

06:36.000 --> 06:41.820
Little something ladies might like from an article tall called 30 things to do with a naked man

06:42.560 --> 06:45.900
Mm-hmm, and this suggestion is find his g-spot

06:47.680 --> 06:54.280
The hint is a guy's prostate the walnut sized gland under his bladder is the

06:54.280 --> 07:00.440
ultimate magic button to push if you want to blow his mind in bed an ultimate magic button to

07:00.800 --> 07:07.320
Analyze it partway through oral sex or intercourse rest two fingers against the swath of skin between his testicles

07:07.320 --> 07:09.320
And they stay the fuck away

07:10.480 --> 07:12.080
You mean taint

07:12.080 --> 07:18.600
You mean it's a do you mean his taint right? It's an efficiency of language issue at this point. You mean his taste using cosmo

07:18.600 --> 07:22.280
Um, please don't tell anyone to do that cosmo

07:22.280 --> 07:27.400
My walnut is a temple and I don't want it doesn't need any insurrectionists

07:27.920 --> 07:29.120
Nuh-uh

07:29.120 --> 07:31.120
What's your walnut? How's everybody's wallet?

07:31.520 --> 07:34.880
Situation today. It's like I it's feeling good the wallet wallets

07:34.880 --> 07:39.640
Fine, I just remember when I went to Bonnaroo and I didn't shower for five days and I got walnut itis

07:41.560 --> 07:48.240
Here's my question what actual situation would that be okay in my god, this is the whoa, whoa

07:48.240 --> 07:56.000
What when I went to see a walnut all adjust about my walnut itis and he checked my walnut like still

07:56.320 --> 08:02.920
Still questionable. Yeah, you know, it's weird about that story Griffin went five days without a shower still shampooed every day. Yeah

08:04.080 --> 08:09.440
I had lots of aquafina which I could you know, hey women my shit up. I don't touch my walnut

08:10.040 --> 08:12.040
Stay away from the walnut. Don't listen to cosmo

08:12.040 --> 08:18.760
Take a chance. This one comes from Yahoo answers user Nikolai. He says or she says no, I think it might be he says

08:18.760 --> 08:22.280
This is under the pregnancy and parenting baby names category

08:22.280 --> 08:26.220
He says can I name my baby girl Justin after Justin Bieber?

08:26.480 --> 08:28.380
Why don't you pick somebody more deserving?

08:28.380 --> 08:33.180
Why don't you pick a more deserving Justin to name your child after someone who's gonna give that kid the sort of

08:33.680 --> 08:39.120
Minute one publicity that a baby starting out in today's fast-paced Twitter based world needs

08:39.120 --> 08:43.200

09:13.840 --> 09:15.360
It was just a boat

09:15.360 --> 09:20.960
It was just a boat at an amusement park and there was there was a calliope in the background

09:20.960 --> 09:24.800
And I was had a belly full of cotton candy. I didn't know what I was doing

09:24.800 --> 09:25.800

It's red like a sunrise. Did he just kill that narwhal?

10:16.960 --> 10:18.960

10:19.360 --> 10:22.700
Stupid Viking Fury get over here. Somebody honey get the muzzle

10:29.760 --> 10:34.360
Oh mush up some mutton, sweetheart for Viking Fury

Take a chance, but she seems to enjoy going to movies dinner and spending a lot of time with me

10:40.760 --> 10:44.000
But I was too timid to make her mine

10:44.000 --> 10:44.920
I got it

10:44.920 --> 10:49.440
I got a piece of advice from a man some unsolicited advice if you want to if you want to go out with this girl

Stop saying creepy shit like make her mine

10:51.920 --> 10:53.920

Twig in there some leaves don't even worry about it. Don't worry about it, but you're mine now

11:33.760 --> 11:36.200
As far as the signs you're looking for

11:44.880 --> 11:46.880
This one comes from Yahoo

11:47.000 --> 11:50.040
answers and I think it's great because

11:50.040 --> 11:56.080
You guys are your professionals at this but the question is who is the founder of acting? I?

11:58.320 --> 12:02.560
Would the subtitle is I would really like to know who is the founder of actor

12:06.640 --> 12:13.040
Any answers, I think it's Aristotle I think Aristotle pretty sure it's Jim Varney

12:13.040 --> 12:20.160
He was Ernest and the dad from Beverly Hillbillies and that coil dog high versatility

12:20.160 --> 12:25.360
I think so. He was the coil dog. Yeah, he was a coil. He's everybody. I didn't know that

12:27.240 --> 12:29.240
Cuz he's a fucking chameleon

12:29.960 --> 12:31.920
It was a chameleon

12:31.920 --> 12:34.120
Were there any answers to that one?

12:34.640 --> 12:36.680
There was one from a guy named theater doc

12:36.680 --> 12:44.440
did he say that what did he say something boring like a poet named Thespis and 534 BC became the first person to play a

12:44.440 --> 12:46.440
part on stage

12:47.120 --> 12:49.120
Barney revolutionized

12:51.240 --> 12:53.040
Perfected it

12:53.040 --> 13:00.400
It's like how the Chinese may have invented fireworks, but I guess the Chinese perfected fireworks. We perfected blowing our hands off

13:00.400 --> 13:04.820
There you go, uh, this one also comes from form spring

13:04.820 --> 13:07.020
Hey guys, just wondering what the word cute means

13:07.020 --> 13:11.620
I hear women use the word in conversation all the time and I am more and more confused about its true meaning

13:11.900 --> 13:13.900
given its multitude of uses

13:15.340 --> 13:17.340
It means chubby

13:18.420 --> 13:20.420
Sorry

13:20.420 --> 13:23.540
But you got a great personality on the great personality

13:23.540 --> 13:30.300
Sorry, they just substitute cute with non-threatening and that's exactly what it means. He's so cute means

13:30.300 --> 13:36.060
He's so non-threatening and by non-threatening it means you you don't you don't know what she means when you she says cute

13:36.060 --> 13:39.820
That's yeah, I'm threatening for you. There's a definition of non-threatening

13:40.460 --> 13:45.320
Hey, hey, um, I got a little piece of advice for you prom king next time you're around

14:11.700 --> 14:13.940

He says my friend doesn't seem to fully grasp the point of the would you rather game?

14:17.540 --> 14:24.300
He puts this question such as would you rather be able to leap over tall buildings or have the ability to hear babies crying anywhere?

14:27.660 --> 14:32.740
Let me just take a tea right here. It's a big tea sack right here and say

14:32.740 --> 14:39.300

16:36.040 --> 16:42.680
Okay, and if you if you don't know what they're interested in use the environment that you're in if you are at a party at

16:42.680 --> 16:44.760
a show at a concert

16:45.560 --> 16:49.200
Reference what is going on around you ask if they're having a good time

16:50.080 --> 16:52.280

17:12.120 --> 17:14.120
And then your best friends

17:14.760 --> 17:18.600

They roll the double else

17:49.040 --> 17:54.480
But as far as the timetable goes don't rush yourself because you don't want to do it when you're not ready and you're not prepared

17:54.480 --> 17:57.240
You don't have the money, but you know, there's no reason to wait

17:57.240 --> 18:02.720
You're not nobody do anything take the leap. Hey, did you ask Jeff? Did you ask Jeffrey if you needed a roommate?

18:03.440 --> 18:08.880
Jeffrey Jeffrey Jeffrey wish to move in together Jeffrey. We've just met Jeffrey, but let's just free

18:08.880 --> 18:11.340
It's a one-bedroom apartment. It's awfully spacious

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Jeffrey Jeffrey

18:14.880 --> 18:18.600
Jeffrey I've got a California king bed. I promise we won't touch Jeffrey

18:19.480 --> 18:22.400
Jeffrey will you hold me during the thunderstorms Jeffrey?

18:23.520 --> 18:25.280

18:36.080 --> 18:40.600
Let's go shopping at the local market Jeffrey to draw Jeffrey

18:43.680 --> 18:51.040
My seven-year-old and I spend a lot of time in the car listening to music while commuting across town to horse her school or mother's house

18:51.040 --> 18:56.520
I'd like to expose her to more artists and songs that I consider insightful and enjoyable, but they use more profanity

18:56.520 --> 19:01.540
At what point is it? Okay to say fuck it and listen and let your kid listen to whatever they want

19:02.200 --> 19:06.480
Now fuck it. I think it's okay to say fuck it after you count to three

19:07.240 --> 19:09.240
Justin could could you perhaps give me?

19:09.600 --> 19:13.920
One two three and fuck it. It's like that just like that

19:14.280 --> 19:19.560
You know what Tommy I think the bigger question is when did you forget what fuck it means?

19:19.560 --> 19:23.200
Like at what like do you do realize that fuck?

19:23.200 --> 19:28.720
It's not like I thought this over and now my response to the situation. My decision is fuck it

19:29.320 --> 19:31.520
Fuck it means like fuck it

19:32.120 --> 19:39.080
I take all the variables into account the only decision I could come to you is fuck it. Fuck it

19:40.240 --> 19:46.680
That's my decision. I checked the bubble box that says fuck it. Thanks to it after weighing all my options

19:46.680 --> 19:48.680
Fuck it

19:48.720 --> 19:51.720
Joseph Joseph Jessup Jessop, Jesse

Jessup Jessop Jesse the third mega mega

20:09.880 --> 20:11.880
What about mega Jessup

20:11.880 --> 20:17.280
Mega Jessup. Hey, who's that? Who's currently destroying our town? It is mega Jessup

20:17.800 --> 20:22.680
To be fair just how he starts out and then he becomes mega Jessup

20:24.600 --> 20:26.600
Don't make him angry

20:31.000 --> 20:35.840
So I'm accompanying my wife to visit her parents in the coming weeks and while the visit is usually rather painless

20:36.040 --> 20:38.600
The bed we are relegated to is very noisy

20:38.600 --> 20:43.240
Being relative newlyweds. We still engage in the relations

20:43.240 --> 20:49.480
If you know what I mean and was wondering what the etiquette on fooling around in this awkward situation might be Jeff

21:00.840 --> 21:02.840
You ready for the pleasure

21:02.840 --> 21:10.320
Mima mima is literally this this wall is stucco. This wall is completely stucco it anything we do

21:15.560 --> 21:17.560
Listen I want to show you

21:17.800 --> 21:20.600
that our relationship is still as fiery as

21:21.600 --> 21:25.760
Fiery as it was when we started no, no Jeff. No

21:26.480 --> 21:28.480
Jeff no, no, no

21:29.280 --> 21:31.280
No, I'm married Jeff. No

21:31.280 --> 21:33.280
Gross Jeff gross

21:34.360 --> 21:37.200
Jeff is a grown-ass man with grown-ass urges

21:39.040 --> 21:43.160
Just got to get himself sassified and Jeff noisy bed

21:44.520 --> 21:48.880
Adjacent me ma or no Jeff needs to get Jeff needs to get his Jeff off

21:51.320 --> 21:53.560
Jeff if you were if your urge

21:54.120 --> 21:56.500
To get your Jeff off is not so strong

21:56.500 --> 22:01.620
But you have to rent that you can't rent a room at the super 8 away from your meemaw

22:01.740 --> 22:05.580
Then your urge to bed down. It's not so strong that it cannot be resisted

22:05.580 --> 22:11.500
I'm saying learn how to bone down on the quiet by an inflatable mattress and lay that out because that completely

22:12.140 --> 22:14.140
Obviates the whole squeaky bed issue

22:15.140 --> 22:21.480
Maybe carry that around your bag and then lay that down and it makes sweet silent love upon it

22:21.480 --> 22:26.400
Maybe you should maybe you should approach this uh, this problem head-on, right? Here's my plan

22:26.800 --> 22:30.320
Go to your in-laws the day day one

22:30.760 --> 22:34.240
Say listen, I appreciate you having us the bed

22:34.240 --> 22:41.100
You've supplied us with is quite loud and we're afraid that our noise making will be a ruckus

22:41.360 --> 22:42.600
so

22:42.600 --> 22:50.360
What bed might be quieter that you could accommodate this with and also where can I put my oversized duffel bag with the words?

22:50.360 --> 22:52.360
lube bags

22:52.640 --> 22:57.520
Said I put that in did look like some spare room in me ma's abode. Can I put it me?

22:57.520 --> 23:00.640
Was room will she be offended? I will need to access it a regular

23:03.360 --> 23:09.840
Meemaw don't be coy, you know exactly what this oil is used for you old whore you old racist whore

23:10.880 --> 23:12.880
Hey Jeff's me mom

Moving on that's the username here via gmail

23:26.900 --> 23:31.900
It's a great question. I think it's one might be divisive has a potential to be divisive peeing in the shower

23:32.040 --> 23:37.280
Yeigh or nay honesty time don't say anything. I think we all just need to

23:37.960 --> 23:39.940
We'll go one two, three

23:39.940 --> 23:47.380
and then go so one two three and then you vote okay all right yeah one two two

23:47.380 --> 23:58.540
three yes no yeah you're a traitor so Travis said no and Justin hey I like

23:58.540 --> 24:04.580
it's the most natural thing in the world I want to throw an addendum in there the

24:04.580 --> 24:08.540
way our bathrooms set up I can just open the curtain and the toilets right there

24:08.540 --> 24:12.800
yeah I will do that from time to time because the convenience factor is the

24:12.800 --> 24:19.380
sale that explains why our magazines are always soiled you're office you know

24:19.380 --> 24:25.060

24:31.520 --> 24:35.340
peeing on your feet you're not being a feet okay I'm not saying like just

24:35.340 --> 24:40.460
start spinning around and urinating wildly on every vertical surface in your

24:40.460 --> 24:47.260
shower I'm saying fucking aim for the drain and be you're lying that's a good

24:47.260 --> 24:51.100
motivational poster you're lying to yourselves because the two of you are

24:51.100 --> 24:56.460
living in sin and you are embarrassed to admit to each other that you might have

24:56.460 --> 25:00.420
stepped in the one another's urine from time to time that's all I'm saying you're

25:00.420 --> 25:04.380
lying I want to do I want to see a poster where a dad puts his hand on his

25:04.380 --> 25:10.420
son's shoulder and just says son aim for the drain we're not stepping in each

25:10.420 --> 25:14.900
we don't take showers together that's not our style we're not down with magic

25:14.900 --> 25:21.500
incest we take separate showers like grown adults grown ass men I'm gonna say

25:21.500 --> 25:26.040
yeah I'll break thank you thank you yeah I mean this is a drain right there it's

25:26.040 --> 25:29.820
practically a toilet you stand up in to get clean the shower is a toilet you

25:29.820 --> 25:34.320
stand up in to get clean recently the buzz about not having elections in

25:34.320 --> 25:38.420
2012 has gained a lot of momentum it seems to stem from several of Obama's

25:38.420 --> 25:41.540
initiatives and other legislation being introduced that gives Obama some

25:41.540 --> 25:46.380
frightening powers for example cyber legislation gives Obama sole power to

25:46.380 --> 25:52.780
shut down the internet presidential term limits repeal of the 22nd amendment and

25:52.780 --> 25:57.900
the controversial 16,000 armed IRS agents on radio and TV I have heard

25:57.900 --> 26:01.020
several comments about the possibility that we will not have presidential

26:01.020 --> 26:05.020
elections in 2012 when guests to the various show mentioned the elections

26:05.020 --> 26:09.860
and possible turnovers in 2012 several hosts have remarked if we have

26:09.860 --> 26:16.380
elections in 2012 now that Obama is a cyber God he can pretty much take that

26:16.380 --> 26:23.060
out with a wave of his cyber hand if if President Obama President Barack Hussein

26:23.060 --> 26:30.220
Obama shuts down the internet can we keep doing our show oh we can shout yeah

26:30.220 --> 26:33.420
we'll just have to yell really loud so we'll do like live stage versions

26:33.420 --> 26:38.860
yeah exclusively Obama has the power to single-handedly shut down the internet

26:38.860 --> 26:43.780
he has a switch on the underside of the of the desk you can't stand up too quick

26:43.780 --> 26:49.460
oops you can't where's my where's my gmail what is gmail there's that it's a

26:49.460 --> 26:53.620
non-existent entity gmail never happened Craigslist sorry out

26:53.620 --> 26:57.980
yeah shut it down Yahoo answers a font of constant comedy

26:57.980 --> 27:04.540
it's gone now this question itself whoa so not only can he shut down the internet

27:04.540 --> 27:11.020
he erases the internet from time he also has that cyber power you mean sole

27:11.020 --> 27:19.860
power he has that sole power from the cyber legislation held in TechnoCon

27:19.860 --> 27:24.440
there was a cyber bill in Techno Congress that gave him the power to go

27:24.440 --> 27:28.340
back in time and stop events from happening Android of the house can you

27:28.340 --> 27:34.220
pass the oil so I can the 22nd amendment hasn't been repealed it's been raised

27:34.220 --> 27:40.520

27:40.520 --> 27:47.980
greatest movie ever time-travel president yeah Yahoo answers user rock

27:47.980 --> 27:54.620
just as that spelled our a queue by the way whoa I'm figuring that's how he

27:54.620 --> 27:58.460
prefers it to be pronounced hey need a film not anything like the

27:58.460 --> 28:07.820
lake house or that sort to watch anything for a 15 year old girl but not

28:07.820 --> 28:16.540
all right not in the wheelhouse of the lake house the only parameters the one

28:16.540 --> 28:24.940
criteria is choice okay might I suggest the lake house no wait fuck you choked

28:24.940 --> 28:29.100
you choked back or what you choked not the lake house anything but the lake

28:29.100 --> 28:36.940
house hmm what maybe something that maybe walk in the clouds maybe that's

28:36.940 --> 28:41.580
not my good I'm thinking of I'm trying to think of other Keanu Reeves time

28:41.580 --> 28:47.780
travel based rom-coms Oh Bill and Ted's excellent love affair

28:48.260 --> 28:56.500
Bill is head's most tender engagement travel through time kiss and George

28:56.500 --> 29:05.100
Carlin this question is troubling to me because of the the addendum I'm

29:05.100 --> 29:11.140
desperate for something different to watch this is a 15 year old girl who her

29:11.140 --> 29:16.140
entire life the only film she's ever watched is the lake house I'm ready for

29:16.140 --> 29:21.060
something I would say the Jurassic Park films that would probably be a good

29:21.060 --> 29:26.020
place to start have you tried Titanic well you've never seen any movies I

29:26.020 --> 29:29.660
don't know where to start with you have you tried anything else it's not not

29:29.660 --> 29:35.900
that she hasn't seen any movies she done seen the lake house don't even try to

29:35.900 --> 29:40.300
quote lake house to her she knows all the lines all the classic classic lines

29:40.300 --> 29:47.580
like how am I I've got a time-traveling mailbox and whoa my wife and I are

29:47.580 --> 29:52.340
expecting first child in a month she wants some songs that would be good to

29:52.340 --> 29:55.780
listen to in the delivery room can you give me some great tracks for this

29:55.780 --> 29:59.940
special occasion that's from Thomas via Gmail no I think we could come up with

29:59.940 --> 30:04.780
something I actually I read this question earlier and I came up with a

30:04.780 --> 30:11.060
really great solution and I think for the the longer portion the more drawn-out

30:11.060 --> 30:15.220
portion like from when she actually gets posted up in the room okay starts

30:15.220 --> 30:20.020
squishing out the baby you put on something soothing right something

30:20.020 --> 30:26.180
mellow something like iron and wines double-sided LP around the well just

30:26.180 --> 30:32.380
something to bring the mood down to see that and then and then right when she

30:32.380 --> 30:38.820
starts crowning thunderstruck by a CDC wow I don't mean you do better than

30:38.820 --> 30:41.500
thunderstruck like if you guys want to try and come at me with something else

30:41.500 --> 30:46.300
but thunderstruck would be come out with arms wide open by Creed fuck you with

30:46.300 --> 30:50.340

41:07.340 --> 41:11.220
last night I went to my friend's 21st birthday party when suddenly his

41:11.220 --> 41:16.180
girlfriend who was very drunk told me she had feelings for me I don't feel the

41:16.180 --> 41:23.300

41:29.300 --> 41:33.700

you got buddy you got a little something I like to call a non problem you do not

41:39.260 --> 41:44.200
have an issue that you need to address here's the important little segment

41:44.200 --> 41:50.420
there she was very drunk doesn't matter I say things it's surfaced guys say

41:50.420 --> 41:54.540
things you wouldn't believe it's astonishing how many questions we get

41:54.540 --> 42:01.220
where my answer is just pack up and move away again because that's literally the

42:01.220 --> 42:04.900
only the only solution I have for this maybe that's why I've been such a

42:04.900 --> 42:11.020
globetrotter these past few years I just keep messing up social situations in my

42:11.020 --> 42:16.900
mind this is unfixable and you have to get all the global reset I'm a 17 year

42:16.900 --> 42:21.020
old New Zealander and over here any showing of anger to anyone will often

42:21.020 --> 42:25.900
result in a physical fight I have the problem that I seem to either bottle it

42:25.900 --> 42:30.260
up I've been meditating late and it seems to help a little in thinking about

42:30.260 --> 42:33.700
things are completely far off the handle and hurt people badly I was wondering if

42:33.700 --> 42:44.860
you guys could help Sean you're you're uh you're talking to three guys who are

42:44.860 --> 42:49.060
raised Baptist if you're looking for guys here tell you to not bottle it up

42:49.060 --> 42:55.460
you've come to the wrong um cork it to your bottle breaks and then you get a

42:55.460 --> 43:03.500
bigger bottle here's one yahoo answer also sent to to me by action Alan thank

43:03.500 --> 43:09.860
you action Alan this one comes from Kyle s he asks I need a list of the most

43:09.860 --> 43:18.460
practical kicks oh just you wait I want a list of kicks all must be practical

43:18.460 --> 43:24.500
and where they would land so far the obvious front kick to groin mid-area

43:24.500 --> 43:32.180
head sidekick to groin mid-area I personally don't like this one because

43:32.180 --> 43:41.020
it's hard to see round kick to lower leg back of knee all suggestions are welcome

43:41.020 --> 43:48.580
I'm gonna kick the spirit yeah how about below to your sub self-conscious hey

43:48.580 --> 43:55.420
listen why do you need this list Sean what are you doing guys can we get he's

43:55.420 --> 43:59.620
got the front he's got the side he's got the round okay considered a donkey kick

43:59.620 --> 44:04.820
a back kick as it's referred to it back some circles where an assailant comes

44:04.820 --> 44:09.580
behind you you can usually kick the front of their knee or groin area and

44:09.580 --> 44:14.300
that will that will completely take them out of the fight altogether have you

44:14.300 --> 44:18.060
tried to spin kick spin kicks really good how about if the coolest kick you

44:18.060 --> 44:21.520
can do how about a kick in which the point of your boot goes into their

44:21.520 --> 44:31.980
butthole a well-aimed butthole kick have you tried perhaps like a reuse style

44:31.980 --> 44:35.900
bicycle kick where you fly through the air for ten seconds and squeal like a

44:35.900 --> 44:39.860
pig about an awesome kid where you literally take their head off in one

44:39.860 --> 44:46.220
clean yeah yeah awesome the mental kick where you don't actually kick but they

44:46.220 --> 44:51.220
think that you do and then about three days their stocks crash what about the

44:51.220 --> 44:54.100
kick where you take your foot off and make the guy smell your foot like in a

44:54.100 --> 45:02.740
funny movie that's pretty funny yeah have you tried it a taint kick what a

45:02.740 --> 45:06.700
taint kick where you kick them square in the tank and it lifts them off of the

45:06.700 --> 45:10.220
ground and into the air by about three feet could I know it's really hard to do

45:10.220 --> 45:15.420
could I suggest a kick kick which is where you kick their kick and disrupt

45:15.420 --> 45:19.620
their kick with you gotta be careful though because if you don't time it

45:19.620 --> 45:22.420
right they'll kick your kick and then you're fucked

45:22.420 --> 45:27.860
it's a kick kick kick let's triple kick the KKK no have you tried to punch kick

45:27.860 --> 45:41.980
which is where you take your shoe off that's a that's a pretty comprehensive

45:41.980 --> 45:49.580
list I feel yeah I think that's all the kids all the kicks I know about yes what

45:49.580 --> 45:55.100
about the junior kick where you kick their kid yeah that's sometimes more

45:55.100 --> 46:01.700
painful in the long run I mean what you need you need a starter that you can

46:01.700 --> 46:06.820
always bring with you a baby is good yeah a dog you can get a dog is good or

46:06.820 --> 46:11.540

46:11.540 --> 46:15.140
just go to town on it and then when they they're gonna look because you're being

46:15.140 --> 46:18.340

Randy Quaid Randy Quaid wasn't in that film yeah it was you're too young to

52:23.140 --> 52:26.100
remember because you just remember him as a hero because you're a child you've

52:26.100 --> 52:35.340
replaced him in your mind's eye with Jesus now is Randy he does hate he does

52:35.340 --> 52:40.060
hate people from other planets but at the millennial Jesus convention he

52:40.060 --> 52:44.980
always covers it up like he doesn't tell Mars Jesus that he hates Martian so it's

52:44.980 --> 52:50.340
a franchise right because I've always assumed the Jesus franchise Jupiter Jesus

52:50.340 --> 52:53.580

53:54.220 --> 53:58.260
simply walking out to her like a creeper and just flat-out asking you

53:58.260 --> 54:03.180

counting her rings or is that all you can consider you sicko what is your life

54:12.900 --> 54:18.020
straight I'm I assume your worry is that you don't have sex in the underage girl

54:18.020 --> 54:24.220
cool what is going on with your life strategy that you think there's a fairly

54:24.220 --> 54:29.260
good chance you could end up boning down on a girl before you figure out what her

54:29.260 --> 54:33.900

here's what I would do I would wait until you know she's gonna walk in her

56:02.380 --> 56:04.860
room then you get a bucket you fill the bucket with water and then you put the

56:04.860 --> 56:10.240
water water bucket half on the door jam and half on the door and then when she

56:10.240 --> 56:15.860
opens the door it it all tumbles on to her she'll be she'll get she'll get

56:15.860 --> 56:20.140
moist from the water in the bucket and okay what you're saying this works both

56:20.140 --> 56:24.500
ways if she broke up with you if she pulled a prank on you then you pointed

56:24.500 --> 56:30.540
her after the water bucket falls on her and you laugh if she dumped you then you

56:30.540 --> 56:36.620
pointed her and say well no one will have you now and the best you're gonna do

56:36.620 --> 56:41.700
wedding film it and put it on YouTube and said you've just made a terrible

56:41.700 --> 56:47.060
