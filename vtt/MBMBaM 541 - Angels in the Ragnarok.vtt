00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and Advice Show for the modern

00:50.000 --> 00:56.880
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:56.880 --> 01:04.480
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. And Travis has a voice, everybody.

01:04.480 --> 01:10.320
Well, so I thought, you know, it's here, this is the last episode of the year,

01:10.320 --> 01:16.000
so we could do our normal, every year, like we do every year, standard, just kind of year-end

01:16.720 --> 01:23.440
review. And just kind of talk about how 2020 went, the highs, the lows, if we can even think of any.

01:23.440 --> 01:29.040
The fashion, if you think of any lows, the fashion, the trends, the movies that shaped us.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.560
The cultural milestones, the moments that united us physically.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.880
Yes, yes, yes, yes. There's a lot. A lot happened this year.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.760
Was that their pizza rat? Was that 2020?

01:45.200 --> 01:48.160
No, I think that was 2017.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.960
Shoot, I was pretty close.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.520
I feel so new. Pizza rat, though.

01:53.520 --> 01:57.600
Okay, what about Balloon Boy? That feels more recent.

01:57.600 --> 02:03.200
Balloon Boy preceded pizza. Balloon Boy flew so Pizza Rat could walk and steal pizza.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.000
So I know that that did not happen in 2020.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.720
It would have been kicked ass if Pizza Rat flew, also.

02:09.440 --> 02:14.400
Well, I played some video games this year.

02:14.400 --> 02:18.880
That's not gonna do it, no. We're looking for, Travis, we're looking for cultural touchstones.

02:18.880 --> 02:25.440
We're looking for big important moments in our, in our, in entertainment history.

02:25.440 --> 02:30.080
Because that's what, what are we now if not part of entertainment history?

02:30.080 --> 02:35.360
Yes. Oh, there was that moment when they said the one movie won an Oscar,

02:35.360 --> 02:36.720
but then it was like no, actually.

02:36.720 --> 02:37.840
Not this year, I don't think.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.000
Fuck, really?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.080
I don't think that one was this year.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.080
It didn't win one this year, I will say.

02:44.080 --> 02:49.120
Um, fucking, come on, y'all, Scoob.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.480
Scoob!

02:50.480 --> 02:53.600
Fucking Scoob definitely came out this year.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.280
Scoob, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.520
Did Scoob come out this year? It did.

02:57.520 --> 03:01.040
Celebrity faux pas. There had to have been those.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.600
Who, who really stepped in it this year?

03:05.600 --> 03:12.400
Uh, oh, oh, Ellen.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.200
Ellen stepped in it.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.520
Ellen did stepped in it this year?

03:19.120 --> 03:21.360
Oh, when she went to that football game.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.760
She did, she, well, she did that.

03:23.760 --> 03:28.160
First off, everybody was like, Ellen's not a nice person, surprise.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.080
And everyone was like, wow, that is a surprise.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.120
Look at her dance.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.600
Are you chill with W? Can you dance like that?

03:33.600 --> 03:35.680
Yeah, and then she's like, I'm not mean.

03:35.680 --> 03:40.560
I'm chilling with war criminal George W. Bush.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.160
We're at a football game.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.520
What's more American than that?

03:45.520 --> 03:46.160
It's hard.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.480
We never really talked about that,

03:48.480 --> 03:51.600
because I think we always assume Ellen is just on the brink

03:51.600 --> 03:52.880
of having us on her program.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.760
So we don't really talk about that stuff a lot.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.760
But the problem is she has to wait for an opportunity

03:57.760 --> 03:59.440
when there are three openings.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.400
Yeah, in a row.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.240
And three chairs.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.360
Three chairs.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.200
She doesn't, she's having more made.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.040
That's what her people keep telling us.

04:08.640 --> 04:14.160
I feel like if the one thing about us is that if we did see,

04:14.160 --> 04:18.960
if we're at football, if we saw W over there,

04:18.960 --> 04:24.000
just like double dipping some nachos and enjoying a Coke.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.800
I feel like we probably would be the,

04:28.800 --> 04:31.680
this is the exact thing that we would get busted for.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.120
Right?

04:33.120 --> 04:35.520
This is the exact thing that would bring it down for us.

04:35.520 --> 04:39.120
It's because it would be like so funny, so funny.

04:39.120 --> 04:39.620
Yeah.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.480
GW was there.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.960
I feel like we would have to get a chill going just for the,

04:46.160 --> 04:46.800
you know what?

04:46.800 --> 04:49.360
If Ellen would come out and be like, it was for the Vine.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.160
Yeah, right?

04:50.160 --> 04:52.160
You know, that was just for the Vine.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.480
Guys, I was making a TikTok.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.280
Don't you get it?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.760
That one was for the Vine.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.320
Guys, fucking Tiger King.

05:00.320 --> 05:01.920
Remember him?

05:01.920 --> 05:03.440
I actually missed that.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.480
I didn't watch it.

05:04.480 --> 05:09.200
This dude, this dude is straight up zany, gang.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.840
And the way he hurt those animals.

05:12.720 --> 05:13.920
It's not funny.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.120
It's not funny.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.280
But every other thing about him,

05:17.840 --> 05:21.840
aside from the assassination attempt and everything else

05:21.840 --> 05:24.960
that that dude sort of snuck his snoot right down into.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.000
All the other bad parts.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.840
So fucking zany.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.120
Zany.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.720
Oh, I loved that.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.640
John Krasinski got out there and he was like,

05:34.640 --> 05:36.720
it's good, fam.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.760
And then he was like, and then he sold it, I guess.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.280
His show, It's Good Fam.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.160
He sold that one.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.920
He sold it.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.400
He did sell It's Good Fam.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.280
I wish.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.320
It's so great.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.560
Why can't we ever sell anything?

05:50.560 --> 05:51.200
Right?

05:51.200 --> 05:53.120
It would be like if somebody came to you, Justin,

05:53.120 --> 05:54.400
and offered you a million dollars

05:54.400 --> 05:56.800
to buy the idea of Munch Squad from you.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.080
Yeah.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.360
Which Justin would do.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.400
In a fucking heartbeat.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.560
Of course I would.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.160
I wouldn't sell it to John, though.

06:06.160 --> 06:06.560
No.

06:06.560 --> 06:10.880
Because he'll just, he'll move in to Munch Squad.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.440
Old John K. will move into Munch Squad.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.040
Kind of polish the place up a bit.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.120
Give it some new curtains.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.280
The curtains of celebrity.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.960
And then he'll sell it at a profit.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.000
Oh, he'll flip it.

06:22.000 --> 06:22.640
Yeah, he'll flip it for sure.

06:22.640 --> 06:23.600
He'll flip Munch Squad.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.760
He's a bit flipper.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.880
He's a bit flipper.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.600
Anything else memorable this year?

06:29.600 --> 06:31.680
Anything else?

06:33.440 --> 06:33.940
Fashion?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.240
Swifties got their fill, didn't they?

06:37.920 --> 06:38.720
Swifties?

06:39.280 --> 06:41.280
You know, Taylor Swift listeners.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.800
Oh, their bellies.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.360
They have sucks.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.360
Oh, they're sated, aren't they?

06:45.360 --> 06:48.400
Big bellies laying on the futon.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.240
Just, oh, I could-

06:50.240 --> 06:52.720
All that music grease all over their cheeks.

06:52.720 --> 06:56.720
Oh, I couldn't possibly Taylor another one.

06:56.720 --> 07:01.440
Oh, we got W.A.P. is a good-

07:01.440 --> 07:03.120
That was a song that everybody really liked.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.240
Yep, yep.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.200
That was a good one.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.320
A powerful anthem.

07:06.880 --> 07:07.600
It's yes.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.560
It stood for what a powerful song.

07:10.560 --> 07:10.800
Yep.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.280
Women are powerful.

07:13.280 --> 07:13.920
That's what it is.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.520
That's what W.A.P. stands for.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.040
Women are powerful.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.560
I never looked it up, but that's what I assume.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.840
I like putting together, like figuring out what things stand for.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.680
It's gotta be women are powerful.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.040
Bacronyms, they call that.

07:25.040 --> 07:25.760
Bacronyms.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.880
Scott's Bacronyms.

07:28.320 --> 07:29.520
Anything else from the year?

07:30.640 --> 07:31.920
There's a big election.

07:31.920 --> 07:32.880
It's a big one.

07:32.880 --> 07:33.760
That one went good.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.600
Yep, went pretty good.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.480
Very smooth.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.280
Very smooth.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.640
I guess Dreamy did come back to Grey's Anatomy.

07:40.640 --> 07:40.960
Really?

07:41.520 --> 07:44.160
Yeah, he super died, but I guess he came on back

07:44.160 --> 07:45.760
because they're having fun over there.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.240
That's it.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.040
That's the last one.

07:47.920 --> 07:48.800
That's all that happened.

07:48.800 --> 07:52.960
It was a pretty smooth year.

07:52.960 --> 07:53.680
Pretty quiet.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.720
Smooth sailing, baby.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.520
At least in the world of entertainment, we can agree.

07:57.520 --> 07:57.760
Yeah.

07:57.760 --> 07:58.800
Yeah, quiet year.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.000
A quiet year.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.920
There was that Munch squad about Mountain Dew doing a cookbook.

08:05.920 --> 08:06.800
You remember that?

08:06.800 --> 08:08.000
Oh, I remember, I remember.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.280
I don't think we can do our own.

08:11.440 --> 08:12.640
There were some pretty epic things that we did.

08:12.640 --> 08:13.440
That was news.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.280
I mean, that was news just because we touched on it.

08:15.280 --> 08:18.640
Yeah, shoot, Travis, tell me more about these epic things we did.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.680
At least as long as they weren't epic fails.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.240
Oh, then I have nothing.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.240
All right, well-

08:26.240 --> 08:27.840
I started doing play-along at home.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.640
That was new.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.520
That was new.

08:29.520 --> 08:30.240
So big.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.600
Oh, I found out that GD Ritzies will sell you the Good Ice

08:33.600 --> 08:35.040
by the bag if you want it.

08:35.040 --> 08:35.760
Really?

08:35.760 --> 08:36.000
Yeah.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.240
The round eye, the little pebbles?

08:38.240 --> 08:38.880
The Good Ice.

08:38.880 --> 08:41.840
They'll give you a bag of the Good Ice for $3.49.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.800
I found that out today.

08:42.800 --> 08:43.040
Nice.

08:43.040 --> 08:46.560
That was a late, late breaking in the year.

08:47.680 --> 08:48.160
I think.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.240
Okay, so that was our year.

08:50.960 --> 08:51.460
Cool.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.720
I didn't have any bathroom time accidents

08:54.720 --> 08:56.800
while driving anywhere in a car.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.080
And that's every year.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.680
And that's not that I do that often,

08:59.680 --> 09:03.040
but it's why I'm so cautious to make sure I go every time

09:03.040 --> 09:05.920
before I'm about to leave the house is for this exact reason.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.200
So I can claim at the end of the year,

09:07.200 --> 09:09.440
no car-based bathroom accidents.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.840
I didn't murder anyone this year.

09:11.840 --> 09:12.960
That's huge.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.720
Yeah, that's huge.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.920
This is an advice show.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.280
Justin, did you murder anyone this year?

09:19.280 --> 09:20.800
This is an advice show.

09:20.800 --> 09:21.680
Only with jokes.

09:21.680 --> 09:25.680
Where you're never forced to incriminate yourself ever.

09:25.680 --> 09:26.320
I'll get you.

09:27.680 --> 09:28.880
You're gonna have to work harder than that.

09:29.520 --> 09:30.720
I'm wearing a wire.

09:30.720 --> 09:34.080
Next year, yeah, that's true.

09:34.080 --> 09:40.400
Next year, we'll be naming 2021, picking the theme of the year.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.120
All right, it's hard to imagine that we'll...

09:43.920 --> 09:47.680
It is a time-honored tradition that we have fucked up

09:47.680 --> 09:49.200
pretty much every single time.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.840
We've talked about this before.

09:53.840 --> 09:57.120
It is cartoonish how bad we did this.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.280
It almost makes you want a counter program

09:59.840 --> 10:01.600
to see if we can steer the year.

10:03.120 --> 10:03.760
You know what I mean?

10:04.880 --> 10:06.160
Work against a theme.

10:06.160 --> 10:06.720
I don't know.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.160
That's like it might be.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.520
We've done some, I guess.

10:09.520 --> 10:10.160
Yes.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.960
Collaborating, I feel like some people did okay.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.680
Listen, there'll be plenty of time

10:15.680 --> 10:17.520
when we talk about this for an entire episode.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.680
But right now, let's help some people.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.160
How do I pretend that I have actually...

10:23.360 --> 10:24.880
Yeah, it's a tough sentence construction,

10:24.880 --> 10:27.600
and I do not blame you for just racing right in there.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.560
How do I pretend that I have seen Love Actually?

10:30.560 --> 10:32.320
My friends keep making references to it,

10:32.320 --> 10:34.560
but I'm just not interested in watching it.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.400
That's from Saving Time in Seattle.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.080
This is a question I very much relate to you

10:38.080 --> 10:40.800
because I too have not seen Love Actually.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.440
Wait.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.240
That is not true.

10:42.240 --> 10:42.560
That's impossible.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.520
It is true.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.400
It is absolutely true.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.040
That's impossible.

10:45.040 --> 10:48.080
Okay, well, okay, let's, okay.

10:48.640 --> 10:54.400
A bunch of established British actors play gentlemen

10:54.960 --> 10:59.840
who have a series of love affairs with their employees.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.440
You don't really realize that until about 15,

11:03.440 --> 11:05.600
your 15th watch or so when you go,

11:05.600 --> 11:08.960
damn, this is all bosses and employees,

11:08.960 --> 11:11.360
and they're kissing and everyone's like, yeah.

11:12.560 --> 11:13.840
Rick Grimes is in it, right?

11:14.640 --> 11:16.800
Yeah, so Rick Grimes has got a different-

11:17.840 --> 11:18.880
This is a different thing.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.760
He's not a boss, but he is like-

11:22.320 --> 11:23.520
He holds up a sign.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.400
So you have seen it, okay.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.000
I have not seen it, Justin.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.920
Everyone knows that in Love Actually,

11:29.920 --> 11:30.960
you could live on the moon-

11:30.960 --> 11:33.120
I just find it hard to believe there's no parts

11:33.120 --> 11:36.480
that you have not osmosed at this point.

11:36.480 --> 11:40.080
Have you not seen it as an intentional thing or-

11:40.080 --> 11:42.080
I just never, it's never come up.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.520
People will be like, oh, you gotta watch.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.480
And I'll be like, okay.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.320
And then like, I just don't.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.480
It's not like I'm actively avoiding it.

11:49.280 --> 11:50.320
It's never happened.

11:50.320 --> 11:53.040
Except for, I talked about it a little bit on Twitter.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.360
And I think the thing is,

11:55.360 --> 11:57.680
my thing on Love Actually right now is that

11:57.680 --> 11:59.440
except for all the parts that are bad,

12:00.240 --> 12:01.360
it's pretty good.

12:01.360 --> 12:01.680
Okay.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.240
Sure.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.760
Well, a ringing endorsement.

12:03.760 --> 12:06.080
I'm running out of the booth right now to go watch.

12:06.080 --> 12:06.960
That's everything.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.880
As you would expect-

12:08.880 --> 12:10.560
That's me, right?

12:10.560 --> 12:12.400
I mean, that's me as a human.

12:12.400 --> 12:12.960
Absolutely.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.640
Except for all the bad parts.

12:14.640 --> 12:15.920
I'll give you a guarantee, Trapp.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.000
Bill Nighy fucking rips my thing.

12:18.000 --> 12:18.960
He does flip.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.000
Well, yeah, he always does.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.200
But I could watch him in-

12:21.200 --> 12:23.920
I could watch him in two Pirates of the Caribbean movies.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.800
But it was the first thing he's ever been in for a man.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.600
Oh, really?

12:27.600 --> 12:27.920
Yeah.

12:27.920 --> 12:28.880
He's been in stuff where you're like,

12:28.880 --> 12:30.480
who's this fucking clown?

12:30.480 --> 12:31.760
At the end of this movie, you're like,

12:31.760 --> 12:33.600
this dude rips.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.560
Every other thing he's ever been in probably is like,

12:37.280 --> 12:41.040
it's me, parishioner John, and I'm a detective, right?

12:41.040 --> 12:44.720
And it's like seven-part miniseries on BBC,

12:44.720 --> 12:47.600
and I'm parish John, and I'm a parishioner,

12:47.600 --> 12:49.120
and also a detective.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.000
God, I'd watch that.

12:50.640 --> 12:53.760
But this one is like, I'm a rock and roll washed out dude,

12:53.760 --> 12:55.920
and I fucking rip, and I'm so funny.

12:55.920 --> 12:59.600
And my storyline is virtually unproblematic.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.760
It is wonderful, it is still problematic.

13:01.760 --> 13:04.640
Except for the fat shaming, it is virtually-

13:04.640 --> 13:05.680
Enormous amount of fat shaming,

13:05.680 --> 13:08.800
but by love actually standards, baby,

13:08.800 --> 13:10.000
that's pretty good.

13:10.720 --> 13:11.840
Is Hugh Grant in it?

13:11.840 --> 13:12.800
I feel like Hugh Grant is in it.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.320
Oh, yeah, Hugh's in it.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.240
He's doing his thing.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.800
How problematic is his storyline?

13:18.800 --> 13:19.520
Oh, baby.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.680
Trav, I'll tell you, bud,

13:21.680 --> 13:24.720
President Billy Bob Thorne comes to visit his place

13:24.720 --> 13:26.320
because he's the prime minister.

13:26.320 --> 13:29.040
But he, as far as I can tell,

13:29.040 --> 13:31.680
touches the shoulder of an employee

13:31.680 --> 13:34.000
that Hugh Grant has his eye on.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.040
So he basically declares war on America.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.120
It's so not far off.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.000
What?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.960
Travis, in the movie Love Actually,

13:42.960 --> 13:44.960
which is good, except for the bad parts,

13:47.280 --> 13:49.040
he falls in love with an employee,

13:49.040 --> 13:51.280
and then the president touches her shoulder,

13:51.280 --> 13:55.280
and he fires her, and tells America to fuck off.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.960
And then he fires her,

13:56.960 --> 14:00.160
but luckily she writes him a note and apologizes.

14:00.160 --> 14:04.000
It's so dopey, and it's so fucking tight,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.600
because then the next five scenes are people partying

14:07.600 --> 14:10.480
because the prime minister just said to America,

14:10.480 --> 14:12.480
we're not fucking friends anymore

14:12.480 --> 14:14.640
because you touched and you tried to Mr. Steal My Girl.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.440
Billy Bob Thorne is indeed the president of America,

14:19.440 --> 14:21.040
which like, yeah.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.240
Not that far off now.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.840
Yeah, I mean, basically.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.880
Okay, correct me if I'm wrong,

14:26.880 --> 14:29.440
in the Rick Grimes storyline,

14:29.440 --> 14:32.400
he holds up the signs to tell a friend's wife

14:32.400 --> 14:33.360
that he's in love with her.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.000
Is that correct?

14:34.560 --> 14:34.960
Yeah.

14:34.960 --> 14:35.920
So you have seen it.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.680
I have not seen it, Justin.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.360
So how problematic is that one?

14:42.240 --> 14:43.920
Pretty, I mean, I don't know.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.920
That one's just weird, man.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.760
Love Actually, pretty weird stuff, man.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.080
It's another good name for the movie.

14:52.080 --> 14:52.800
Oh, geez.

14:52.800 --> 14:58.640
There's also, it opens with just a pretty choice 9-11 reference

14:58.640 --> 15:03.440
and then it also ends with us celebrating

15:03.440 --> 15:06.800
a huge breach of airport security protocols.

15:06.800 --> 15:07.600
And you're supposed to be like,

15:07.600 --> 15:09.680
yeah, breach those airport security protocols

15:09.680 --> 15:10.960
for the name of love.

15:10.960 --> 15:14.800
But also, oh, you did the time period.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.240
Not great for this.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.080
Yeah, it's a trip, not a good flick,

15:18.080 --> 15:20.800
but it's a lot of fun except for the bad stuff.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.280
That feels like a lot of usable stuff for the question

15:23.280 --> 15:24.320
asker to reference.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.640
Yes, absolutely.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.720
That's literally, I can't think of another thing

15:28.720 --> 15:29.280
you need to know.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.920
Is there anyone else in it of note?

15:32.560 --> 15:34.480
Everyone is in it of note, Travis.

15:35.360 --> 15:35.680
Okay.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.000
Oh man, Mr. Bean's in it.

15:40.000 --> 15:40.960
What?

15:40.960 --> 15:42.240
Yeah, he's got a super funny bit.

15:42.240 --> 15:45.760
He's got two actually super, super funny bits.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.280
Laura Linney is in it.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.480
Yeah, yeah.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.120
And this is not funny anymore.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.880
No, you're just listening to things that happen.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.720
But I feel like, can I say something?

15:54.720 --> 15:57.680
Holistically speaking, we have answered the question.

15:57.680 --> 15:58.400
Absolutely.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.360
Because now, assuming you listened to,

16:01.360 --> 16:06.080
the answer is listen to this episode of My Brother, My Brother,

16:06.080 --> 16:07.680
and Me, and then you'll come away with it

16:07.680 --> 16:09.440
like pretty much getting it.

16:09.440 --> 16:12.080
Yeah, this podcast within a podcast that I'm calling

16:12.080 --> 16:13.440
Love Actually, Actually.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.480
There's some porn people.

16:15.520 --> 16:16.240
What?

16:16.240 --> 16:16.640
Yeah.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.640
Some body doubles for sex.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.200
Naked.

16:19.200 --> 16:19.680
A lot of nudes.

16:19.680 --> 16:20.400
Body doubles.

16:20.960 --> 16:21.360
The Hobbit is naked.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.960
There's a lot of nudity in it.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.680
The Hobbit is naked in it, and Laura Linney is naked in it,

16:25.680 --> 16:28.240
and other people are naked in it.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.440
It's like surprisingly like-

16:29.440 --> 16:32.160
Now, Elijah Wood Hobbit or that other guy?

16:32.160 --> 16:32.560
No.

16:32.560 --> 16:33.360
Watson.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.480
Fuckin' Morgan Freeman.

16:34.480 --> 16:35.600
Yeah, Morgan Freeman.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.120
Not Morgan Freeman, Martin Freeman.

16:37.120 --> 16:37.600
No.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.240
I said it wrong.

16:38.240 --> 16:38.740
Okay.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.800
Morgan Freeman, Martin Freeman make love as body doubles.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.080
Morgan Freeman as the Hobbit.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.560
And make a baby named Morgan Freeman.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.080
Okay, so can I do a Yahoo?

16:48.080 --> 16:48.720
I'd love that.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.080
This is our son, Morgan.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.520
And we love him very much.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.000
We're proud of him even though he's never accomplished anything.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.840
This one was sent in by Brian.

16:57.840 --> 16:58.880
Brian sent this in.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.240
It's from Yahoo!

17:00.240 --> 17:01.280
Answers user more850.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.080
It never will.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.840
It never will.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.240
He's the worst seven-year-old on the planet.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.200
I'm extremely proud of my son that I dislike, Morgan.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.320
I'm proud of him even though he's disappointed in me.

17:12.320 --> 17:16.400
I'm sorry that I have also wanted to say it's very rude of me,

17:16.400 --> 17:18.400
Martin Freeman, that for a while there,

17:18.400 --> 17:21.520
I took all the parts from everybody and didn't leave any.

17:21.520 --> 17:22.080
That guy.

17:22.640 --> 17:22.880
Yeah.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.000
That guy.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.720
We were so close to moving on, by the way.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.160
We were so close.

17:28.160 --> 17:28.720
What?

17:28.720 --> 17:30.080
I was trying to power through.

17:30.080 --> 17:33.520
No, but I just wanted to say Martin Freeman treated himself

17:33.520 --> 17:35.600
to being that guy on The Office.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.920
Then he dipped into Love Actually and got his snoot wet over there.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.560
Then he's like, I'll just go ahead and be Bilbo.

17:43.520 --> 17:48.080
Then he's like, let me real quick just nab Arthur Dent real quick,

17:48.080 --> 17:50.160
because nobody can think of other people like me.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.560
I'm just going to get Arthur Dent real quick,

17:52.560 --> 17:57.040
and then I would just love to star in Fargo and go ahead and slide me into—

17:57.040 --> 17:57.840
Oh, Sherlock?

17:57.840 --> 18:00.320
Iconic role of Dr. John Watson?

18:00.320 --> 18:02.400
Yeah, might as well grab that up too.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.200
Let me just see how many of these parts I can fit in my mouth.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.240
Well, that's obvious why Morgan can't live up to that.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.920
That's so hard.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.320
Poor Morgan Freeman.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.880
That's just more stuff you can use when somebody's like,

18:14.880 --> 18:16.400
you've seen Love Actually, and you can be like,

18:16.400 --> 18:21.440
you mean the one with the dude from Fargo and Sherlock and the Hobbit?

18:22.080 --> 18:23.840
With a disappointing son?

18:23.840 --> 18:25.440
With a disappointing son.

18:25.440 --> 18:27.120
I heard he just joined the soccer team.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.920
We'll see how long that lasts.

18:29.920 --> 18:34.320
Okay, on a very weirdly related note, Brian sent this in.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.960
It's Yahoo Answers user more850 who asks,

18:36.960 --> 18:42.240
Has there ever been a scoreless basketball game?

18:42.240 --> 18:44.880
I couldn't find any example of a pro or college basketball game

18:44.880 --> 18:47.120
where the plays were tracked, et cetera,

18:47.120 --> 18:51.360
and where the score was something to zero or even zero to zero.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.560
Has this ever happened?

18:52.560 --> 18:53.920
I assumed it would be a big story if it did.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.800
If it never happened, what is the closest to a scoreless game ever?

18:56.800 --> 18:59.600
Either closest to zero zero or closest to something to zero,

18:59.600 --> 19:00.960
i.e. widest point margin.

19:00.960 --> 19:05.280
I'm only interested in documented games, not some game you saw one time.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.440
It can't actually happen.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.880
Yeah, basketball rules preclude it, right?

19:13.520 --> 19:15.680
So here's the way it works in sport.

19:17.120 --> 19:23.600
And this is amateur, semi-pro, pro-am, pro.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.840
And you know this just because you were a scorekeeper

19:25.840 --> 19:28.000
for the, I believe, elementary school team?

19:28.000 --> 19:33.040
Yes, the Miller Owls, I was the scorekeeper for that basketball team.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.760
A school which no longer exists.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.440
A school that is a park.

19:37.440 --> 19:41.040
Because they fucking slam dunked the house down.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.040
Yeah, they shattered the room

19:43.040 --> 19:46.000
and that was apparently holding the whole thing up.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.840
The art school, the gymnasium, the lunch room.

19:49.840 --> 19:53.120
Yeah, so what happened on this is, here's the deal.

19:53.120 --> 19:58.800
Anytime that a score is run up sufficiently on the other team

19:58.800 --> 20:03.520
to where there's not much chance of it being competitive,

20:03.520 --> 20:06.960
at that point you trade in or you sub in,

20:06.960 --> 20:09.760
if you wanna use the parlance of sport,

20:09.760 --> 20:14.560
you sub in some of your bad players to give them a chance

20:14.560 --> 20:19.200
to get more accustomed to being on the field or of play,

20:19.200 --> 20:22.240
which is to say the basketball rectangle.

20:22.240 --> 20:26.400
And you give them a chance to kind of get the nerves out,

20:26.400 --> 20:29.360
like play in your first big game, but the stakes aren't that high.

20:29.360 --> 20:32.880
And the problem is, if you go long enough down that road

20:32.880 --> 20:34.880
and the other team is still scoreless,

20:34.880 --> 20:38.160
at that point you are mandated to start doing

20:38.160 --> 20:40.960
what are called inspirational sub-ins.

20:40.960 --> 20:41.840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.360
They're Facebook bait, basically.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.080
So if the game is close.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.080
Yeah, like the water boy gets to play.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.040
Exactly, right?

20:47.040 --> 20:49.200
At that point, the mascot comes by and he's like,

20:49.200 --> 20:52.880
I would love to shoot a few or I'd like to play point guard for a bit.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.360
And like, some guys.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.120
They start reaching out to people in the crowd,

20:55.120 --> 20:56.400
like anybody out there.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.960
Some guy's grandpa who never made the game winning.

20:59.840 --> 21:00.720
You see where we're going.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.200
The coach, but he's wearing a propeller hat.

21:04.560 --> 21:10.560
A girl, whatever, whatever it may be.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.560
That was a joke about society, Griffin.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.320
Oh, look at the layers.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.600
But the point is, that is what happened.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.320
The farther down that rabbit hole you go,

21:20.320 --> 21:22.800
the more people by the end of it,

21:22.800 --> 21:27.040
the opposing team is going to be like Alf, a trash can.

21:31.360 --> 21:35.760
The idea of capitalism, like you're not going to have a team really.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.760
Another stationary basketball.

21:39.280 --> 21:40.480
That's wearing sunglasses.

21:41.200 --> 21:45.200
A team from that bottle planet from Superman,

21:45.200 --> 21:46.880
you know, the bottle city of Kandor.

21:48.560 --> 21:52.320
An actual air bud, but it's just a dog that doesn't,

21:52.320 --> 21:54.000
doesn't really have the skills.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.040
He's got to start somewhere.

21:55.040 --> 21:58.880
But that is why you cannot have a scoreless game,

21:58.880 --> 22:02.000
because eventually there's just no competition whatsoever.

22:02.640 --> 22:07.280
I think it's mean that in professional sports,

22:07.280 --> 22:08.720
they don't have the mercy rule.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.080
I think that, because I remember being a kid

22:12.080 --> 22:14.400
and playing a lot of different sports

22:14.960 --> 22:18.160
and really appreciating the fact that the mercy rule existed.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.280
Because mostly it meant that I could stop,

22:21.280 --> 22:24.240
I don't know, picking up pieces of grass in the field or whatever,

22:24.240 --> 22:27.280
and I could go home and think about my poetry or what have you.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.880
I think that that needs to exist more,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.640
because I would like to see more press conferences

22:34.640 --> 22:37.760
with like grown adults talking about how they got mercy.

22:38.960 --> 22:42.000
That would be something, although I will say, Travis,

22:42.000 --> 22:49.040
at halftime, the Monstars were up 63 to 18 over the Toon Squad.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.080
That is pretty high.

22:50.080 --> 22:55.520
They could have gone ahead and joint them off

22:55.520 --> 22:57.120
to Moron Mountain right then and there,

22:57.120 --> 22:57.840
but they didn't.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.360
They came back, they played the whole damn thing.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.600
What a great name for an amusement park, by the way.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.360
Can we just acknowledge that if there was a place

23:03.360 --> 23:05.600
called Moron Mountain in your hometown,

23:05.600 --> 23:07.600
you'd be wicked proud of that.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.880
Yeah, yeah.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.160
I'm just saying maybe the Monstars weren't the bad guys.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.880
Hey, let's look back and really reexamine.

23:14.880 --> 23:19.680
I think it's time that we put a new lens and look at-

23:19.680 --> 23:20.320
Ooh!

23:20.320 --> 23:22.720
Space Jam and see if the Monstars are the bad guys.

23:22.720 --> 23:26.080
They were pretty tacitly endorsing slavery,

23:26.080 --> 23:28.560
I'm pretty sure that team was.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.000
Okay, there's that.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.240
Yeah, but we haven't even considered the idea

23:34.240 --> 23:38.480
of the scoreless basketball game of two teams playing each other.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.960
And I'm not saying like it's alpha and a garbage can,

23:40.960 --> 23:46.000
just like maybe two teams, like the Orlando Magic

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
and the Charlotte Hornets are just having an off day

23:50.000 --> 23:53.760
and it's third period, third quarter,

23:53.760 --> 23:56.000
and it's just like, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.

23:56.000 --> 23:56.880
God, again!

23:58.000 --> 24:00.480
Eventually one of us is gonna have to get this in,

24:00.480 --> 24:02.080
but it just hasn't happened yet.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.760
There is another option though, Griffin.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.200
It doesn't have to be they're playing as the worst.

24:05.200 --> 24:08.800
It could be like the Golden State Warriors

24:08.800 --> 24:10.560
against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

24:11.120 --> 24:11.680
Yeah.

24:11.680 --> 24:14.080
Two teams that I think are good

24:14.080 --> 24:15.760
or at least have been within the last decade.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.360
Oh, I see what you're saying.

24:17.360 --> 24:21.600
And they're so good that now it's becoming a defense,

24:21.600 --> 24:25.120
a battle of defense where like they're making good shots,

24:25.120 --> 24:28.000
but it's just like every time, boom, someone's there,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.920
boom, someone's there, boom, someone's there.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.480
They're playing their gall darn hearts out.

24:32.480 --> 24:35.840
Alternatively, they both got sixth man.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.360
Oh, wow.

24:37.360 --> 24:42.320
They both got ghost friends, ghost family,

24:42.320 --> 24:43.520
that are like in there.

24:43.520 --> 24:46.160
And so when somebody comes up to dunk one in

24:46.160 --> 24:48.640
and they just use their ghost hand to slap it away,

24:48.640 --> 24:50.480
I think if that happens to you once,

24:51.200 --> 24:52.400
that's probably enough for you to be like,

24:52.400 --> 24:54.400
oh, there's a ghost.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.680
There's gotta be a ghost.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.880
Can you imagine a scene like that happening in a movie

24:58.880 --> 25:00.640
and there's a little kid in the crowd

25:00.640 --> 25:02.560
and he's like clutching his little pennant,

25:02.560 --> 25:05.440
but then the same thing happens for the other team too.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.040
And he looks across the court

25:07.040 --> 25:09.760
and there's another little kid sitting on the other side

25:09.760 --> 25:11.200
and he's holding a different pennant

25:11.200 --> 25:12.320
and they like look at each other

25:12.320 --> 25:14.480
and they kind of mouth like, did you pray to God too

25:14.480 --> 25:15.520
that they would win?

25:15.520 --> 25:17.520
Oh man, I prayed to God that they would win.

25:17.520 --> 25:18.720
Oh, beans.

25:18.720 --> 25:24.720
Man, there had to be the MLB commissioner at some point

25:24.720 --> 25:27.920
had to be like, gang, we gotta start keeping an eye out

25:27.920 --> 25:29.280
for these fucking angels.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.960
Everybody's got angels now.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.040
Everybody's got angels now and it's great.

25:33.040 --> 25:35.040
We're out there and it's like, oh man,

25:35.040 --> 25:39.280
is old Tony Danza gonna pitch a no hitter or not?

25:39.280 --> 25:41.840
And then it's like, but fucking 10 feet over here,

25:41.840 --> 25:45.360
10 feet overhead, there is a biblical angel battle happening

25:45.360 --> 25:46.320
between both teams.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.720
Ragnarok is happening right here.

25:48.720 --> 25:49.920
Every game and it's so loud.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.120
Would you stop them?

25:51.120 --> 25:53.360
At some point the baseball would stop, right?

25:53.360 --> 25:56.800
Like you couldn't keep doing baseball with that going on.

25:56.800 --> 26:00.880
Well, as in the sky, you see like fucking, I don't know.

26:00.880 --> 26:04.000
Chris Lloyd pulls out his flaming sword and strikes down.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.800
Yeah, you see the little boy stand up and wave his arms

26:08.800 --> 26:10.320
to signal that angels are here,

26:10.320 --> 26:13.600
but across the field a different boy is also waving

26:13.600 --> 26:15.680
their arms and you're like, oh no.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.920
Oh no, it's ghosts v. angels.

26:17.920 --> 26:21.200
Then you hear seven horns and you know.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.880
As the seals rip open.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.560
As the seals, it's time.

26:25.360 --> 26:27.520
And this is an exhibition game.

26:27.520 --> 26:28.160
Yeah.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.520
We're ending the world.

26:29.520 --> 26:30.960
This is the all-star game.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.720
What are you doing?

26:32.720 --> 26:34.480
It's the home run derby.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.320
It's the battle where, it's the all-star game.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.960
It's the battle when all stars will be snuffed out

26:38.960 --> 26:41.280
and darkness will reign.

26:41.280 --> 26:41.920
All stars.

26:43.120 --> 26:46.240
This is the celebrity versus retired baseball players

26:46.240 --> 26:47.120
charity event.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.160
What is happening?

26:51.200 --> 26:55.120
An angel just lifted up Dan Levy and flew him around the bases.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.240
What is going on?

26:57.120 --> 26:58.000
I'll tell you what's going on.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.080
We're going to the money zone.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.040
Thank God.

27:01.040 --> 27:11.280
Oh, that was smooth as butter, baby.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.240
You know what everybody needs?

27:16.880 --> 27:17.360
What, Trav?

27:17.920 --> 27:20.800
Well, I mean, if you think about it, there's a lot.

27:20.800 --> 27:21.520
There's a lot.

27:21.520 --> 27:24.800
But you know what they need most of all?

27:24.800 --> 27:25.760
Stamps.

27:25.760 --> 27:26.160
Yeah.

27:26.160 --> 27:26.720
Wow.

27:26.720 --> 27:26.960
Yeah.

27:28.000 --> 27:28.800
Yeah, Griffin.

27:28.800 --> 27:29.440
Wow.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.560
Got it one, dude.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.440
Awesome.

27:31.440 --> 27:32.560
Yeah, it's Stamps.

27:33.120 --> 27:33.520
Awesome.

27:33.520 --> 27:36.400
You ever try to mail one of those letters without it?

27:36.400 --> 27:37.920
Yeah, you get left out.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.280
Not going to get very far.

Yeah, Griffin, you idiot.

28:10.400 --> 28:10.720
I did.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.600
We're reading the same ad copy.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.880
I know everything you know.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.240

28:16.880 --> 28:17.520
Okay.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.480
What did I have for lunch?

28:19.200 --> 28:20.160
Spaghetti.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.440
No, leftover ribs.

28:21.440 --> 28:22.640
No, think about it.

28:22.640 --> 28:23.120
Think about it.

28:23.120 --> 28:23.680
Think about it.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.280
Oh, shit, it was spaghetti.

Well, it's a great time to learn a new language.

28:54.800 --> 28:55.300
Babble.

28:55.300 --> 28:58.420
It's a great time to learn a new language.

29:00.420 --> 29:05.060
It's a good skill to have, and you can feel more connected to a culture,

29:05.060 --> 29:07.540
keep your brain sharp, and you can learn a new language with Babble.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.460
I already knew about that.

29:09.460 --> 29:11.220
Travis has been telling me forever about that.

29:11.220 --> 29:12.100
Babble.

29:12.100 --> 29:13.140
It's a cool new-

29:13.140 --> 29:14.740
You can learn Etruscan.

29:14.740 --> 29:15.140
All right.

29:17.220 --> 29:20.980
It's a new language learning method designed to get you speaking your new language

29:20.980 --> 29:24.340
within weeks with daily 10 to 15-minute lessons.

29:24.340 --> 29:26.580
You start with words and phrases, and then you get to sentences,

29:26.580 --> 29:28.180
and then you get to even more complex stuff.

29:28.180 --> 29:29.540
I'm guessing paragraphs.

29:29.540 --> 29:32.100
Pretty soon, a couple paragraphs.

29:32.100 --> 29:33.860
Pretty soon, short conversations.

29:33.860 --> 29:38.260
After that, you're reciting monologues, cool monologues from cool movies,

29:38.260 --> 29:40.820
like Reservoir Dogs, but in Japanese and shit.

29:40.820 --> 29:43.300
I've been taking Pig Latin classes.

29:43.300 --> 29:44.500
I've almost done it.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.980
It seems like the Klingons are everywhere, right?

29:46.980 --> 29:52.340
You can't swing a phaser without hitting some Klingons.

29:52.340 --> 29:54.660
They are infiltrating our society.

29:55.940 --> 29:56.420
Sorry.

29:56.420 --> 29:59.860
It's good if you can talk to them and be rational,

29:59.860 --> 30:02.340
as much as they are willing to be rational with you.

30:04.420 --> 30:06.100
Babble's a perfect place to learn Klingon.

30:06.900 --> 30:07.460
All right.

30:07.460 --> 30:09.140
You can choose from 14 different languages,

30:09.140 --> 30:11.540
including Spanish, French, Italian, and German.

30:11.540 --> 30:12.580
Right now, Babble is offering our listeners-

30:12.580 --> 30:15.140
I'm just going to go out on a limb real quick and interrupt Griffin one more time

30:15.140 --> 30:21.220
to say I don't know if they teach Klingon, Pig Latin, or Etruscan.

30:21.220 --> 30:24.020
I just want to make that clear in case they are listening.

30:24.740 --> 30:25.300
They are.

30:25.300 --> 30:25.780
They're mad.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.060
We're not getting paid for this one.

30:27.060 --> 30:28.740
This one's on the house, Babble.

30:28.740 --> 30:31.940
So right now, Babble is offering our listeners three months free

30:31.940 --> 30:33.460
with the purchase of a three-month subscription

30:33.460 --> 30:35.380
with promo code MYBROTHER, all one word.

30:35.380 --> 30:36.500
Visit babble.com.

30:36.500 --> 30:39.300
Use the promo code MYBROTHER on your three-month subscription.

30:39.300 --> 30:43.380
That's B-A-B-B-E-L.com to use promo code MYBROTHER.

30:43.380 --> 30:44.580
I was just kidding.

30:44.580 --> 30:45.620
We're going to get paid.

30:46.980 --> 30:48.340
That's Babble's slogan.

30:48.340 --> 30:50.020
That's good.

30:50.020 --> 30:50.520
Weird.

30:52.820 --> 30:55.460
Hi, it's me, Dave Hill from before,

30:55.460 --> 30:58.340
here to tell you about my brand new show on Maximum Fun,

30:58.340 --> 30:59.940
the Dave Hill Good Time Hour,

30:59.940 --> 31:02.260
which combines my old Maximum Fun show,

31:02.260 --> 31:05.140
Dave Hill's podcasting incident with my old radio show,

31:05.140 --> 31:06.740
the goddamn Dave Hill Show,

31:06.740 --> 31:09.620
into one new futuristic program from the future.

31:09.620 --> 31:12.740
If you like delightful conversation with incredible guests,

31:12.740 --> 31:16.740
technical difficulties, and actual phone calls from real-life listeners,

31:16.740 --> 31:18.740
you've just hit a street called easy.

31:18.740 --> 31:20.980
I'm also joined by my incredible co-host,

31:20.980 --> 31:23.060
the boy criminal Chris Gersbeck.

31:23.060 --> 31:23.940
Say hi, Chris.

31:23.940 --> 31:25.140
Hey, Dave, it's really great to-

31:25.140 --> 31:26.180
That's enough, Chris.

31:26.180 --> 31:28.260
And New Jersey chicken rancher Dez.

31:28.260 --> 31:29.140
Say hi, Dez.

31:29.140 --> 31:29.940
Hey, Dave.

31:29.940 --> 31:31.540
The Dave Hill Good Time Hour,

31:31.540 --> 31:34.660
brand new episodes every Friday on Maximum Fun.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.540
Plus, the show's not even an hour, it's 90 minutes.

31:37.540 --> 31:39.460
Take that, stupid rules.

31:39.460 --> 31:40.260
We nailed it.

31:43.620 --> 31:46.340
Hey, it's the last time in 2020,

31:46.340 --> 31:49.220
but I did want to say bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

31:49.220 --> 31:51.300
Oh, funeral for a friend.

31:51.300 --> 31:54.740
Yeah, we're going to say goodbye to it for this calendar year.

31:54.740 --> 31:58.740
It's the last final Munch Squad of the year.

31:58.740 --> 32:04.580
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

32:04.580 --> 32:06.420
I want to Munch Squad.

32:06.420 --> 32:06.740
Squad.

32:06.740 --> 32:09.060
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.660
I want to Munch Squad.

32:10.660 --> 32:10.980
Squad.

32:10.980 --> 32:13.220
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

32:13.220 --> 32:14.740
I put it in a minor key.

32:14.740 --> 32:15.460
It was pretty-

32:15.460 --> 32:18.580
Have you guys noticed that the sunset period of Munch Squad

32:18.580 --> 32:21.460
is longer than the first period of Munch Squad,

32:21.460 --> 32:23.140
the sunrise period, I suppose?

32:23.140 --> 32:26.900
There was more episodes in Twin Peaks The Return

32:26.900 --> 32:28.580
than there were David Lynch directed episodes

32:28.580 --> 32:29.300
in the original run.

32:30.740 --> 32:31.220
Interesting.

32:31.940 --> 32:41.460
I don't have a Munch Squad this week for this final episode,

32:41.460 --> 32:49.140
but I wanted to kind of just go through all the press releases

32:49.140 --> 32:50.420
that are right now.

32:50.980 --> 32:52.260
And I want to say goodbye.

32:52.260 --> 32:54.500
It is not actually the end of Munch Squad, obviously,

32:54.500 --> 32:56.180
but it is the end of 2020.

32:56.180 --> 33:00.980
And that means that it is the end of brands

33:00.980 --> 33:03.300
talking about how bad 2020 has been

33:03.300 --> 33:07.300
and how their products are the solution to that.

33:07.300 --> 33:09.780
So I want to just go through some very quick ones

33:09.780 --> 33:11.300
just to kind of say goodbye to it,

33:11.300 --> 33:14.180
because it makes me happy every time a brand does it.

33:14.180 --> 33:15.940
And so I wanted to say goodbye to them.

33:15.940 --> 33:18.660
And when I tell you some of these headlines of the articles,

33:19.220 --> 33:21.700
you might struggle to think of how they're going to do it,

33:21.700 --> 33:22.980
but I'm sure they will.

33:23.540 --> 33:26.020
Some of these I haven't even found it yet.

33:26.020 --> 33:27.860
I'm just confident it'll be there.

33:27.860 --> 33:31.300
Tropical Smoothie Cafe introduces Mardi Gras-themed menu

33:31.300 --> 33:31.940
for the new year.

33:33.700 --> 33:36.180
So they got hurricane smoothie

33:36.180 --> 33:39.860
and some fresh Cajun-style food items.

33:39.860 --> 33:41.380
Fresh Cajun-style smoothie.

33:42.100 --> 33:45.380
As guests nationwide welcome a fresh start in the new year,

33:45.940 --> 33:48.020
we remain committed to providing guests

33:48.020 --> 33:49.860
better-for-you smoothies and food

33:49.860 --> 33:51.380
that inspire a healthier lifestyle.

33:51.380 --> 33:55.620
This is Charles Watson, the CEO of Tropical Smoothie Cafe LLC.

33:56.580 --> 33:58.740
We understand Mardi Gras celebrations

33:58.740 --> 34:00.660
may look a little different this year.

34:00.660 --> 34:00.980
Okay.

34:02.900 --> 34:05.940
But it's our hope that these fun and bold Mardi Gras flavors

34:05.940 --> 34:07.940
transport guests to tropic time

34:08.580 --> 34:11.380
and provide a moment for a little break.

34:12.100 --> 34:13.220
How inspirational.

34:13.220 --> 34:15.460
You know, it's beautiful.

34:16.100 --> 34:18.340
Burger King is offering a new dollar menu.

34:18.340 --> 34:20.820
It's the $1 Your Way menu.

34:21.700 --> 34:24.980
We know that value is extremely important to our guests,

34:24.980 --> 34:29.460
especially now, says CMO Ellie Doty in a statement.

34:29.460 --> 34:30.980
That's why we set out to create a menu

34:30.980 --> 34:32.660
that offers craveable products,

34:32.660 --> 34:34.420
like our bacon cheeseburger

34:34.420 --> 34:36.980
that can't be found at the same price anywhere else.

34:36.980 --> 34:38.580
And I got to hand it to them.

34:38.580 --> 34:42.420
I cannot buy a Burger King hamburger for a dollar

34:42.420 --> 34:44.100
at any other restaurant.

34:44.100 --> 34:45.380
But what if you could?

34:45.380 --> 34:49.300
Hi, I'm Travis McRae and here's my proposal.

34:49.300 --> 34:50.500
I call it re-burgers.

34:51.140 --> 34:52.980
Now you sell them the hamburger

34:52.980 --> 34:54.580
and then you buy it right the hell back.

34:57.380 --> 34:58.660
Doty told Business Insider,

34:58.660 --> 35:01.060
this is the part that I really actually can't make heads or tails of,

35:01.060 --> 35:05.540
that Burger King thinks about what might resonate with customers

35:05.540 --> 35:08.020
at any given time during the year

35:08.020 --> 35:09.940
and attempts to provide a solution.

35:09.940 --> 35:10.900
But what do they need?

35:13.060 --> 35:15.700
When we promote a value menu

35:15.700 --> 35:17.860
or launch a $1 Your Way menu,

35:17.860 --> 35:21.620
being sensitive to when that might be most useful to our guests

35:21.620 --> 35:23.620
is definitely top of mind.

35:23.620 --> 35:25.860
What are you saying?

35:25.860 --> 35:28.820
You have a big red button that says $1 menu

35:28.820 --> 35:29.940
and you're like, not yet.

35:29.940 --> 35:30.660
They're not ready.

35:30.660 --> 35:32.500
We gotta wait until they need it.

35:33.220 --> 35:35.220
If it goes out now, we will go unappreciated.

35:36.820 --> 35:40.260
The Hangover Crystal returns by popular demand for $1.69.

35:41.060 --> 35:43.220
Folks, I am at three in a row here.

35:43.220 --> 35:44.740
I'm just going down.

35:44.740 --> 35:48.020
The Hangover Crystal is back for $1.69.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.460
That is a little crystal hamburger

35:49.460 --> 35:51.620
with bacon, egg, and cheese and onions on it.

35:52.180 --> 35:55.300
A fresh cracked fried egg, a steamed bun and all that.

35:55.860 --> 35:58.100
Crystal is well known as the go-to remedy

35:58.100 --> 36:00.900
after a night of overindulgence, says Angela Johnson,

36:00.900 --> 36:02.260
VP of marketing.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.820
After the ups and downs of 2020,

36:04.820 --> 36:08.020
the Hangover Crystal with its fresh cracked fried egg

36:08.020 --> 36:11.620
is sure to be the perfect cure after New Year's celebration.

36:11.620 --> 36:14.100
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

36:14.100 --> 36:15.780
That tracks, that tracks.

36:16.420 --> 36:19.060
Papa John's launches new epic stuffed crusts.

36:19.060 --> 36:20.340
Let's see if he's got one here.

36:21.060 --> 36:22.100
Come on, Papa.

36:22.100 --> 36:23.380
Come on, Papa, don't break.

36:23.380 --> 36:24.820
Papa baby hungry.

36:24.820 --> 36:26.180
Papa Shaq, deliver.

36:26.180 --> 36:28.660
He does say, as we continue to develop

36:28.660 --> 36:30.420
new craveable menu offerings,

36:30.420 --> 36:32.580
we're always inspired by our fans.

36:32.580 --> 36:34.820
That's beautiful, I think.

36:34.820 --> 36:37.300
And it's something our fans continue to ask for.

36:37.300 --> 36:39.060
So you keep giving it to them, don't you?

36:39.620 --> 36:40.420
Nasty.

36:42.020 --> 36:43.940
But wait, they don't explicitly say,

36:43.940 --> 36:45.620
but also things are shitty.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.100
Then we're fucking free, aren't we?

36:48.100 --> 36:48.900
Then we're fine.

36:48.900 --> 36:52.100
This is, I know people are so stoked about this vaccine,

36:52.100 --> 36:54.500
but to me, this is the sign of the times

36:54.500 --> 36:57.620
that we are just through this thing.

36:58.580 --> 37:00.100
Yeah, we finally did.

37:00.100 --> 37:02.020
I mean, that is really the sign, Griffin,

37:02.020 --> 37:06.260
that COVID's over and we're all safe now, you know?

37:06.980 --> 37:08.340
Well, we're getting there, getting there.

37:09.620 --> 37:11.860
Well, it just feels like everybody's safe

37:11.860 --> 37:13.700
to just burn your masks,

37:13.700 --> 37:15.700
because Papa John says that it's fine to-

37:16.420 --> 37:19.300
Burn your masks, burn your pants, whatever you got.

37:19.300 --> 37:19.940
Really?

37:19.940 --> 37:22.740
Taco Bell's famed nacho fries return for the holidays-

37:22.740 --> 37:24.020
We were out!

37:24.020 --> 37:26.980
In a year as difficult and uncertain as this one is,

37:27.860 --> 37:31.540
we know our customers crave the comforts they love most.

37:32.100 --> 37:34.660
That's why we're excited to bring back nacho fries,

37:34.660 --> 37:37.220
because Trump was a bad president in coronavirus.

37:39.460 --> 37:42.820
And we thought that would help if nacho fries came back

37:42.820 --> 37:47.060
because of so many people that died from coronavirus

37:47.060 --> 37:48.740
and nobody could touch anybody,

37:48.740 --> 37:50.980
but you can't get these nacho fries

37:50.980 --> 37:52.180
and we think he'll fix it.

37:52.180 --> 37:54.100
The magic of nacho fry franchise

37:54.100 --> 37:56.900
extends beyond the menu item itself.

37:56.900 --> 37:57.700
Oh, yes.

37:57.700 --> 38:01.940
It's the magic of the nacho fries franchise.

38:01.940 --> 38:05.460
It's gonna reach out of the menu and into the empty chair

38:05.460 --> 38:07.620
where Grandpa Bob used to sit.

38:08.180 --> 38:10.580
It extends beyond the menu item itself

38:10.580 --> 38:13.300
and is brought to life with our next saga

38:13.300 --> 38:15.700
of the nacho fries movie franchise

38:15.700 --> 38:20.420
that we hope brings some seasonal and seasoned joy to fans.

38:20.420 --> 38:22.580
Like, only we can.

38:22.580 --> 38:24.260
This is another sign of times people are like,

38:24.260 --> 38:26.340
can we start being ironic again?

38:27.060 --> 38:30.500
We've been good boys this year

38:30.500 --> 38:32.500
just talking about how shitty everything is

38:32.500 --> 38:34.020
and how we hope we can bring you some comfort,

38:34.020 --> 38:36.900
but now can we start getting fucking silly on it again?

38:36.900 --> 38:39.220
Can we go back to pretending like nacho fries

38:39.220 --> 38:41.380
are the most important thing on the planet?

38:41.380 --> 38:44.020
We've been acknowledging that there are other things

38:44.020 --> 38:46.340
on the planet other than Taco Bell for a year now

38:46.340 --> 38:47.860
and it's killing us!

38:47.860 --> 38:51.140
It's killing us! Are they being nacho fryronic?

38:52.260 --> 38:53.540
No, they're not.

38:53.540 --> 38:54.580
Oh, okay. All right.

38:54.580 --> 38:55.620
I really thought they were.

38:56.740 --> 39:01.060
The sixth chapter of the cinematic trailer style ad creative

39:01.060 --> 39:05.540
titled The Craving and starring Sarah Hyland and Joe Keery

39:05.540 --> 39:07.940
explores the thrilling journey of a nacho fry...

39:07.940 --> 39:08.820
Shut up!

39:08.820 --> 39:12.420
Explores the thrilling journey of a nacho fry obsessed protagonist

39:12.420 --> 39:14.980
and his intensifying desire for Taco Bell's

39:14.980 --> 39:17.860
most craveable creation as the potato plot thickens.

39:18.660 --> 39:19.220
I think...

39:20.740 --> 39:23.780
Listen, I'm not going to go off on one of my famous

39:23.780 --> 39:25.700
Dennis Miller style rants here.

39:25.700 --> 39:26.100
Yeah.

39:26.100 --> 39:30.740
But if Taco Bell truly believes that nacho fries

39:31.380 --> 39:33.700
are the most craveable menu item,

39:33.700 --> 39:35.620
then I would say that Taco Bell,

39:36.180 --> 39:39.780
every time it removes nacho fries from their menu,

39:39.780 --> 39:41.780
has committed an immoral act.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.060
Well, you know, Justin,

39:43.060 --> 39:46.020
sometimes the people, they crave it too much.

39:46.020 --> 39:48.420
And society, that's when we have a recession.

39:48.420 --> 39:49.780
So Taco Bell has...

39:49.780 --> 39:52.260
And listen, we're all sad that they're gone,

39:52.260 --> 39:54.820
but the economy is able to rebuild as people once again,

39:54.820 --> 39:58.580
focus on their jobs and bills and whatnot.

39:58.580 --> 40:00.260
But then there comes a time where

40:00.260 --> 40:01.620
it's not about the money, Justin.

40:01.620 --> 40:04.500
It's about the people and the people need the nacho fries.

40:04.500 --> 40:05.860
And it's time for them to come back

40:05.860 --> 40:07.940
so they can be distracting.

40:07.940 --> 40:09.620
Now, here's what I think.

40:09.620 --> 40:11.540
If Taco Bell really wants to commit to this,

40:11.540 --> 40:12.740
they're so craveable.

40:12.740 --> 40:14.100
This movie thing that they're making

40:14.100 --> 40:18.100
would end with a man killing someone to get nacho fries.

40:18.100 --> 40:19.380
It would be gruesome.

40:19.380 --> 40:22.420
And I would say maybe even like NC-17.

40:23.220 --> 40:25.220
And I think if they did that,

40:25.220 --> 40:28.180
they would probably see like a 3% increase in sales.

40:29.140 --> 40:31.140
I mean, I'd love to see them try.

40:31.140 --> 40:32.740
It'd be worth a shot, you know?

40:32.740 --> 40:33.240
Yeah.

40:34.260 --> 40:35.620
There's just not enough like,

40:35.620 --> 40:39.780
oh, let's make a Hallmark movie or whatever

40:39.780 --> 40:41.940
about A.C. Slater making some fried chicken.

40:41.940 --> 40:42.900
And it's like, yeah, okay.

40:42.900 --> 40:46.740
But how about also there's full frontal nudity in it, right?

40:46.740 --> 40:48.180
Let's be adults about this

40:48.180 --> 40:52.100
and let's make our weird fast food movies

40:52.100 --> 40:53.940
just a little bit more explicit.

40:53.940 --> 40:56.580
Game of Thrones came out and that was all about Coca-Cola.

40:56.580 --> 40:57.860
So let's focus on.

40:58.660 --> 41:00.180
Remember how the end of Game of Thrones

41:00.180 --> 41:01.060
is about Coca-Cola?

41:01.060 --> 41:02.900
You remember when it was like,

41:02.900 --> 41:05.140
there's only one way to stop this dragon flame

41:05.140 --> 41:07.060
with an ice cold Coca-Cola.

41:07.060 --> 41:09.220
And they were like, who gets to be king now?

41:09.220 --> 41:11.860
And they're like Coca-Cola, the king of soda.

41:11.860 --> 41:14.900
And Coca-Cola changed their motto to Coca-Cola,

41:14.900 --> 41:15.700
king of soda.

41:15.700 --> 41:16.660
You remember.

41:16.660 --> 41:17.700
You remember that, please.

41:17.700 --> 41:19.700
Remember when Arya Stark was like,

41:19.700 --> 41:21.060
winter may no longer be coming,

41:21.060 --> 41:23.140
but that doesn't mean we can't all chill.

41:23.140 --> 41:24.340
And then she lowered her sunglasses

41:24.340 --> 41:25.940
and took a big drink of Coca-Cola.

41:25.940 --> 41:26.340
You remember.

41:26.340 --> 41:27.780
Ice cold Coca-Cola.

41:27.780 --> 41:29.140
You remember.

41:29.140 --> 41:29.640
Remember.

41:30.900 --> 41:32.180
How about another question?

41:32.180 --> 41:32.500
Okay.

41:32.500 --> 41:33.000
Sure.

41:33.460 --> 41:35.220
I'm at a permanent employee at a place

41:35.220 --> 41:37.860
that hires a lot of temporary workers for the holidays.

41:37.860 --> 41:39.380
Mostly having the extra help is great,

41:39.380 --> 41:42.180
but there's one thing that annoys me to no end.

41:42.180 --> 41:44.260
I have a favorite seat in the break room

41:44.260 --> 41:46.980
with the most comfortable chair and the quietest spot.

41:46.980 --> 41:48.260
It's a prime spot.

41:48.820 --> 41:50.740
The majority of my regular coworkers know

41:50.740 --> 41:52.180
this is my favorite spot

41:52.180 --> 41:53.860
and leave me be during lunch breaks.

41:54.580 --> 41:55.380
Breaks and lunch,

41:55.380 --> 41:58.500
but the new people seem to descend on my table en masse

41:58.500 --> 42:00.820
and steal it from me every single day.

42:00.820 --> 42:03.220
How can I keep the newbies away from my favorite spot?

42:04.340 --> 42:06.660
That's from Seat Squatter in Spokane.

42:06.660 --> 42:09.220
Well, considering the one good news is

42:11.300 --> 42:14.180
you listen to this on December 28th or later,

42:14.820 --> 42:16.100
so they're unemployed now

42:16.100 --> 42:17.860
and you got, you're sitting pretty, huh?

42:18.900 --> 42:20.020
Things are looking good over there.

42:20.020 --> 42:21.300
Things are looking good for you.

42:21.300 --> 42:23.620
You got that seat back, didn't you, Scrooge?

42:23.620 --> 42:24.500
Mm-hmm.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.100
Also, fake vomit.

42:26.900 --> 42:27.780
Oh, that's good.

42:27.780 --> 42:28.660
That's another thing.

42:28.660 --> 42:31.060
A lot of those funny prank gifs,

42:31.780 --> 42:33.940
whoopee cushion, dog do,

42:33.940 --> 42:36.660
those are all sort of- Joy buzzer.

42:36.660 --> 42:38.260
Joy buzzer, put a joy buzzer on there

42:38.260 --> 42:40.900
and somebody sits on it and it just zaps their ass.

42:40.900 --> 42:42.420
Just a bunch of crazy glue on there?

42:42.420 --> 42:43.380
No, that's the opposite,

42:43.380 --> 42:44.340
because then they wouldn't get up.

42:44.980 --> 42:46.740
Yeah, what's the opposite crazy glue?

42:48.980 --> 42:49.620
Sane glue?

42:49.620 --> 42:50.340
Normal glue.

42:50.340 --> 42:51.620
Sane lube, I think.

42:51.620 --> 42:52.500
Yeah, there it is.

42:53.620 --> 42:55.380
Just some old sand.

42:56.340 --> 42:57.220
Speaking of pranks,

42:57.220 --> 43:04.340
I was getting some pranks for Charlie for Christmas.

43:04.340 --> 43:04.580
Okay.

43:04.580 --> 43:05.940
This kid loves pranks.

43:05.940 --> 43:07.460
She watches those Troom Troom videos.

43:07.460 --> 43:08.500
Those aren't even really pranks,

43:08.500 --> 43:11.060
but yeah, the kid loves pranks.

43:11.060 --> 43:12.100
So I was getting some pranks

43:12.100 --> 43:16.500
and there was a prank that was a shocking lighter.

43:16.500 --> 43:17.220
Huh.

43:17.220 --> 43:19.060
And I was getting these pranks.

43:19.060 --> 43:20.100
I looked at that and I was like,

43:20.100 --> 43:20.980
oh, that would be fun.

43:21.540 --> 43:23.140
And then in my head, I had this thought,

43:23.140 --> 43:24.740
I'll have to teach you how to use a lighter.

43:24.740 --> 43:28.260
And I would realize that what I just thought was,

43:28.260 --> 43:30.580
I have to teach my six-year-old how to use a lighter

43:30.580 --> 43:32.340
so they can get shocked by it.

43:32.340 --> 43:36.340
And that was maybe the worst impulse,

43:36.340 --> 43:38.580
the worst parody impulse I've had so far.

43:38.580 --> 43:39.940
And I've had some hun-diggers,

43:39.940 --> 43:41.860
but I will have to teach my six-year-old

43:41.860 --> 43:43.940
how to use a lighter so she can be shocked

43:43.940 --> 43:47.540
by the fake lighter is pretty high on the list.

43:49.860 --> 43:53.140
I mean, maybe try new chairs.

43:53.140 --> 43:55.620
Chairs, have you tried all the chairs?

43:56.420 --> 43:58.500
I feel like probably not.

43:58.500 --> 44:00.900
Anybody who has a favorite seat in the break room hasn't,

44:00.900 --> 44:03.300
or at least you haven't tried the chairs in a while.

44:03.300 --> 44:04.420
Maybe there's some new,

44:04.420 --> 44:07.460
maybe there's a new sort of spring orientation

44:07.460 --> 44:11.460
in one of the chairs that you should be excited to have.

44:11.460 --> 44:14.100
You know, in many ways, a new year is like a new chair.

44:14.900 --> 44:16.340
Yeah, yeah.

44:16.340 --> 44:18.260
What's the view gonna be?

44:18.260 --> 44:21.380
You know, what kind of sights and sounds and smells

44:21.380 --> 44:22.980
are there in this new chair?

44:22.980 --> 44:26.020
Oh, I've got a great view of the snack machine,

44:26.020 --> 44:29.060
and I can see that one of those chip bags is dangling there,

44:29.060 --> 44:31.300
and if I just slam my shoulder into it,

44:31.300 --> 44:33.700
free lays, you know?

44:34.340 --> 44:36.820
And that is a lot like finding love in the new year.

44:37.540 --> 44:39.220
Yeah, hey, can I do a Yahoo?

44:39.220 --> 44:39.700
Yes, please.

44:41.060 --> 44:42.420
This one's sent in by Graham Robock.

44:42.420 --> 44:43.140
Thank you, Graham.

44:43.140 --> 44:45.620
It's Yahoo Answers user, Dan, who asks,

44:46.340 --> 44:49.940
what is something non-edible that you wish you could eat?

44:49.940 --> 44:50.980
Oh, good question, Dan.

44:50.980 --> 44:54.260
Well, the top Yahoo answer on this is just like,

44:54.260 --> 44:56.660
and I'm sure they shot this off four seconds

44:56.660 --> 44:59.300
after the question was posted, and it's Tide Pods.

45:00.100 --> 45:02.740
And like, yeah, yeah, it's a meme,

45:03.300 --> 45:06.420
but like, guys, when I see those things,

45:06.420 --> 45:08.660
I still think like, what's the,

45:08.660 --> 45:12.580
there's a fucking flavor mystery about these.

45:12.580 --> 45:14.500
I know that's played, but damn,

45:14.500 --> 45:16.500
when was the last time you saw one of these guys?

45:16.500 --> 45:17.860
The lumpptious they look.

45:17.860 --> 45:19.460
I feel pretty strongly about dice,

45:19.460 --> 45:22.580
because there's some like really good looking,

45:22.580 --> 45:25.540
like hard candy looking dice out there that I love.

45:25.540 --> 45:27.540
So you want it to be like a hard candy.

45:27.540 --> 45:32.500
I like, there's a sort of three-dimensional polygonal

45:33.620 --> 45:38.420
shape to gushers that like, I see a nice D8,

45:38.420 --> 45:41.540
and I think, oh, I would love to gush on that.

45:42.820 --> 45:44.420
I think pretty much anything.

45:44.420 --> 45:47.220
I wish I could just, I think it'd be really dramatic,

45:47.220 --> 45:48.900
and not for everybody, let me be clear.

45:48.900 --> 45:50.420
I want to be like Matter Eater Lad,

45:50.980 --> 45:53.940
where like, I'd just be in the middle of a conversation

45:53.940 --> 45:55.380
with someone and be like, oh, hold on one second.

45:55.380 --> 45:57.220
And I just like take a bite out of a car.

45:57.220 --> 45:59.220
I just think that'd be such a fucking power move.

45:59.220 --> 46:00.180
Yeah.

46:00.740 --> 46:03.140
Just cause there's like lots of things you could eat.

46:03.140 --> 46:03.300
Right.

46:03.300 --> 46:06.100
Doesn't mean like you would wanna all the time.

46:06.100 --> 46:06.740
You know what I mean?

46:06.740 --> 46:08.820
Like, I bet sometimes things are messy.

46:10.660 --> 46:12.820
Like if Matter Eater Lad had roommates,

46:13.380 --> 46:16.180
and they're like, it's really messy here.

46:16.180 --> 46:18.980
Can you eat all the trash?

46:18.980 --> 46:20.900
Do you think they ever tried to get him to do that?

46:20.900 --> 46:24.100
Just like, listen, trash stays it for almost a week,

46:24.100 --> 46:25.940
and there's so much trash that's really piling up.

46:25.940 --> 46:27.540
Could you just eat all the trash?

46:27.540 --> 46:30.740
What if Matter Eater Lad didn't have a super power?

46:30.740 --> 46:33.220
He just really liked making people happy.

46:33.220 --> 46:34.580
And he really liked that.

46:34.580 --> 46:36.980
He was just eager to please.

46:36.980 --> 46:40.420
He loved winning those like dollar, like cafeteria bets

46:40.420 --> 46:42.020
of like, eat the spoon.

46:42.020 --> 46:43.860
He's like, okay, you got it, man.

46:43.860 --> 46:47.540
Matter Eater Lad just had low self-esteem.

46:47.540 --> 46:49.540
He would do fucking anything for the vine.

46:49.540 --> 46:51.380
And really strong enamel.

46:51.380 --> 46:51.940
That was that.

46:51.940 --> 46:52.500
Right.

46:52.500 --> 46:52.740
Yeah.

46:52.740 --> 46:53.540
It was just committed.

46:53.540 --> 46:54.420
Yeah, I'm eating it.

46:54.420 --> 46:55.140
I'm eating it.

46:55.140 --> 46:55.940
It's fun.

46:55.940 --> 46:56.660
It's fun.

46:56.660 --> 46:57.940
We're having a good time, right?

46:57.940 --> 46:59.860
Everybody, it's fun to have you around.

46:59.860 --> 47:01.300
You guys remember my name, right?

47:01.300 --> 47:02.420
You'll remember it tomorrow?

47:02.420 --> 47:02.820
Yeah.

47:02.820 --> 47:03.220
Promise?

47:03.220 --> 47:05.540
Hey, you'll invite me to the next party again, right?

47:05.540 --> 47:06.740
I'm eating the bottle.

47:06.740 --> 47:08.420
My birthday's coming up soon.

47:08.420 --> 47:08.980
What?

47:08.980 --> 47:09.780
A shoe?

47:09.780 --> 47:10.100
Okay.

47:10.100 --> 47:14.180
Okay, I'll eat the shoe.

47:14.180 --> 47:15.060
I'll tell you something.

47:15.860 --> 47:18.340
I'll tell you, I'll tell you, I'll tell you boys

47:18.340 --> 47:20.740
and the folks at home, one thing that's not edible

47:20.740 --> 47:21.780
that I wish I could eat.

47:22.340 --> 47:26.820
And that's Aunt Rhonda's green bean casserole.

47:31.700 --> 47:33.460
We have an Aunt Rhonda?

47:33.460 --> 47:35.540
It's fucking putrid Rhonda.

47:36.260 --> 47:38.100
Wait, I've never met Aunt Rhonda.

47:38.100 --> 47:40.660
Oh, you would know her by the smell

47:40.660 --> 47:42.980
of her bean bean casserole.

47:42.980 --> 47:43.940
That's what she calls it.

47:43.940 --> 47:45.860
Why doesn't she want to meet me?

47:45.860 --> 47:48.420
Do you know the woman that dad always brings to things

47:48.420 --> 47:50.660
and her name is Rhonda and it's his sister?

47:50.660 --> 47:51.300
Yeah?

47:51.300 --> 47:52.500
That's your Aunt Rhonda.

47:52.500 --> 47:53.940
Oh, fuck.

47:54.660 --> 47:54.980
Yeah.

47:55.780 --> 47:57.620
Yeah, you just never made the connection.

47:57.620 --> 47:58.740
Yeah, I never put that together.

47:59.300 --> 48:01.940
You know how there's always that bean bean casserole

48:01.940 --> 48:05.700
at Thanksgiving and Christmas and Easter

48:05.700 --> 48:07.540
and Halloween for some reason.

48:07.540 --> 48:08.740
Yeah, yeah, no, I know.

48:08.740 --> 48:09.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:09.940 --> 48:11.220
And in your mailbox.

48:11.220 --> 48:12.420
In your mailbox.

48:12.420 --> 48:13.300
Very threatening.

48:14.180 --> 48:16.500
Yeah, you know how she always buries a knife in it

48:16.500 --> 48:19.220
that says you and just leaves it at her doorstep?

48:19.220 --> 48:20.100
That's Aunt Rhonda.

48:20.100 --> 48:21.060
Oh!

48:21.060 --> 48:22.980
You know how every Christmas when she comes over

48:22.980 --> 48:25.860
she races as fast as she can to your bedroom

48:25.860 --> 48:28.820
and dumps green bean casserole all over the bed?

48:29.700 --> 48:32.340
You know how she hides individual servings

48:32.340 --> 48:34.980
in places you won't find them for months

48:34.980 --> 48:39.860
until the putrid, wretched stink of this inedible food mess

48:39.860 --> 48:41.220
has claimed your-

48:41.220 --> 48:42.180
That's Aunt Rhonda.

48:42.180 --> 48:42.980
Oh, okay.

48:43.780 --> 48:44.180
Yeah.

48:44.180 --> 48:46.340
You remember how that one morning

48:46.340 --> 48:48.740
you went to check on your firstborn and they were gone

48:48.740 --> 48:51.620
and it was just green bean casserole left there in their stead?

48:51.620 --> 48:54.500
Yeah, and we launched that nationwide search that lasted for weeks.

48:54.500 --> 48:58.180
Yeah, but then it turned out it was just Dad's sister Rhonda.

48:58.180 --> 48:58.680
Yeah.

48:59.540 --> 49:00.660
That's Aunt Rhonda.

49:00.660 --> 49:02.820
Oh, that's Aunt Rhonda.

49:02.820 --> 49:04.980
Trav, do you remember when you were trying to perfect

49:04.980 --> 49:07.460
teleportation technology and someone left

49:07.460 --> 49:09.220
a green bean casserole inside

49:09.220 --> 49:11.540
and you turned it into half green bean casserole, half man?

49:11.540 --> 49:12.980
Oh, I remember it well.

49:12.980 --> 49:14.020
That was Aunt Rhonda.

49:14.020 --> 49:14.900
No!

49:14.900 --> 49:16.580
Yeah, she's the one that left it there.

49:17.140 --> 49:17.540
Okay.

49:19.060 --> 49:22.020
I just can't keep her, I just can't keep that casserole down.

49:22.020 --> 49:22.820
It's not that bad.

49:23.540 --> 49:25.220
Put a little ketchup on there.

49:25.220 --> 49:28.820
The twist of this, the thing we need to clarify in this question,

49:28.820 --> 49:30.900
what is something non-edible you wish you could eat,

49:30.900 --> 49:34.740
is would we be able to assign the flavor to it?

49:34.740 --> 49:39.060
Because things like fingernails,

49:39.060 --> 49:42.180
if they didn't hurt your belly and they tasted like Pringles,

49:42.900 --> 49:44.660
that would be pretty cool, I think.

49:44.660 --> 49:46.500
But I think the reality of it would be like,

49:46.500 --> 49:48.740
so say it was like cars, right?

49:48.740 --> 49:51.140
You could take a bite of a car, it would be car flavored.

49:51.700 --> 49:52.660
It would taste like a car.

49:52.660 --> 49:55.780
Just because you can chew it up and swallow it and digest it

49:55.780 --> 49:57.940
doesn't change the flavor of it.

49:57.940 --> 50:02.660
Yeah, it wouldn't change the atomic, yeah.

50:02.660 --> 50:04.740
Gosh, I'm having fun today.

50:04.740 --> 50:05.620
You know what, lotion.

50:05.620 --> 50:08.660
Lotion would be so good.

50:08.660 --> 50:09.460
No, okay.

50:09.460 --> 50:11.300
Yes, actually it smells so good

50:11.300 --> 50:13.860
and sometimes you get too much lotion

50:13.860 --> 50:15.780
and you're like, what am I gonna do with all this?

50:15.780 --> 50:16.980
If you could lick it off your,

50:18.100 --> 50:19.940
lick it right off your hands, clean off your hands,

50:19.940 --> 50:20.660
that'd be perfect.

50:20.660 --> 50:22.020
That'd be so good.

50:22.020 --> 50:23.940
Would it taste like what it smells like?

50:23.940 --> 50:25.300
Or would it taste like lotion?

50:25.300 --> 50:28.260
Which is, I would wager, pretty bad.

50:28.260 --> 50:29.940
Well, if it tasted too good,

50:30.500 --> 50:32.020
that would be hard to moisturize

50:32.020 --> 50:33.940
because then you start licking yourself all the time.

50:33.940 --> 50:37.460
If the lotion tasted good and you could eat it,

50:37.460 --> 50:39.140
it has become yogurt.

50:41.940 --> 50:43.460
Wow, that aught saying.

50:44.100 --> 50:44.740
Yeah.

50:44.740 --> 50:47.940
Just like if yogurt makes your hands soft

50:47.940 --> 50:51.700
and it doesn't taste very good, that's lotion now.

50:51.700 --> 50:53.620
Yogurt seems sort of flexible enough

50:53.620 --> 50:55.700
that we're gonna get some people tweeting

50:55.700 --> 50:57.620
and that's like, actually yogurt makes it great.

50:58.180 --> 50:59.540
Just stop it, okay?

50:59.540 --> 51:01.300
Please, 2020 is almost over.

51:01.300 --> 51:02.180
Let's just get through this

51:02.180 --> 51:04.100
and you can get back on our case next year, all right?

51:04.100 --> 51:07.220
But just give us a break for once.

51:07.220 --> 51:07.780
And you know what?

51:07.780 --> 51:08.740
We'll do the same for you.

51:08.740 --> 51:10.740
We'll give you a break from listening to us

51:12.100 --> 51:12.980
continue to talk.

51:13.540 --> 51:15.300
Just give you a nice clean one.

51:15.300 --> 51:16.820
You thought you were gonna have to go into this

51:17.380 --> 51:19.220
for the long haul

51:19.220 --> 51:21.700
and we're gonna let you out of class, comedy class.

51:21.700 --> 51:24.900
We're gonna let you out five minutes early for some reason.

51:24.900 --> 51:26.660
Sometimes Justin is just done.

51:27.220 --> 51:28.740
Sometimes I'm just done, y'all.

51:28.740 --> 51:30.420
It's been a long year

51:30.980 --> 51:34.820
and I think that we could all use a few minutes to ourselves.

51:34.820 --> 51:35.540
Yeah, you know what?

51:35.540 --> 51:37.220
Everybody gets five quiet minutes.

51:37.220 --> 51:38.740
We're gonna put our heads down.

51:38.740 --> 51:40.660
Don't look back at the teacher's desk.

51:40.660 --> 51:41.940
We're back here smoking.

51:41.940 --> 51:42.900
You locked your kid's door

51:42.900 --> 51:45.060
and you told them that they could come out in 60 minutes

51:45.060 --> 51:45.940
when you're done with our show.

51:45.940 --> 51:47.540
Well, you get five extra minutes,

51:47.540 --> 51:49.140
however you wanna spend them.

51:49.140 --> 51:50.340
That's your time.

51:50.340 --> 51:52.180
That's for you.

51:52.180 --> 51:53.140
Drink some water.

51:53.140 --> 51:54.340
Hey, with that five minutes,

51:54.340 --> 51:55.140
drink some water.

51:55.140 --> 51:56.340
Close your eyes for a minute.

51:57.300 --> 51:57.860
Just breathe.

51:57.860 --> 51:58.980
Just breathe.

51:58.980 --> 52:00.180
God, just breathe.

52:00.180 --> 52:01.140
Just breathe.

52:01.140 --> 52:03.140
And listening and listen to us tell you

52:03.140 --> 52:05.940
that we got a book coming out.

52:05.940 --> 52:07.300
A couple of books I wanna tell you about.

52:07.300 --> 52:09.620
January 26th at 9 p.m.

52:09.620 --> 52:10.820
There's a free virtual event.

52:11.780 --> 52:13.700
We partner with six independent bookstores

52:14.420 --> 52:15.620
to promote our book.

52:15.620 --> 52:17.700
Everybody has a podcast except you.

52:17.700 --> 52:20.020
It is a how-to book, a how-to podcast,

52:20.020 --> 52:22.180
but it's also funny and fun to read.

52:22.180 --> 52:23.140
And we worked really hard on it.

52:23.140 --> 52:25.540
And if you pre-order from one of these

52:25.540 --> 52:26.340
six independent bookstores,

52:26.340 --> 52:29.620
you can get a exclusively designed book plate

52:29.620 --> 52:31.780
signed by one of us with your copy.

52:31.780 --> 52:32.580
While supplies last,

52:32.580 --> 52:36.420
you can go to bit.ly forward slash McElroy podcast book event

52:36.420 --> 52:38.260
for bookstore links and more information.

52:38.260 --> 52:43.620
I also wanna tell you that the Sawbones paperback book is,

52:44.260 --> 52:45.460
as you're listening to this,

52:45.460 --> 52:49.940
is out tomorrow, I think, on Tuesday.

52:49.940 --> 52:52.420
So please, if you have not pre-ordered that already,

52:52.420 --> 52:53.300
please pre-order that

52:53.300 --> 52:55.140
because the first week is really important for a book.

52:55.140 --> 52:57.380
And if you could just tweet about it

52:57.380 --> 53:01.700
and help us make that a big hit,

53:01.700 --> 53:02.740
that would be just the best.

53:02.740 --> 53:04.420
I ordered 20 of them, Justin.

53:04.420 --> 53:04.900
Thank you, Travis.

53:04.900 --> 53:09.460
And I'll be reselling them at $3 above market price.

53:10.020 --> 53:12.580
Wow, that is less great.

53:12.580 --> 53:14.580
You can get them wherever fine bookstores,

53:14.580 --> 53:15.780
books are sold.

53:15.780 --> 53:16.660
Or at my house.

53:16.660 --> 53:17.700
You can come to my house.

53:17.700 --> 53:19.620
I'll have 20 copies for sale

53:19.620 --> 53:21.060
and I'll even sign them for you.

53:21.620 --> 53:23.060
If you get it from bookshop.org,

53:23.060 --> 53:27.860
you can actually support a real bookstore.

53:27.860 --> 53:30.020
Or you can go to TravisMcElroy.com

53:30.020 --> 53:31.380
and look at pictures of me.

53:32.500 --> 53:32.900
Okay.

53:32.900 --> 53:34.100
Another great thing to do.

53:34.100 --> 53:36.820
You can also pre-order The Adventure Zone Crystal Kingdom.

53:37.540 --> 53:40.660
It's the, what, Jesus' fourth book in the series?

53:40.660 --> 53:42.500
Go to theadventurezonecomic.com.

53:42.500 --> 53:43.700
It comes out July 13th,

53:43.700 --> 53:46.740
but go ahead and make sure you got a copy heading your way.

53:46.740 --> 53:48.900
And we also have a bunch of merch, Travis.

53:48.900 --> 53:50.340
We do have a bunch of merch.

53:50.340 --> 53:50.980
If you're listening,

53:50.980 --> 53:52.820
you have like two or three more days

53:52.820 --> 53:55.540
to order the Festo pin of the month,

53:55.540 --> 53:57.380
which benefits the Transgender Law Center,

53:57.380 --> 53:58.260
that Festo pin.

53:58.260 --> 54:00.420
It's really, really cool if you haven't seen it.

54:01.140 --> 54:03.220
And the proceeds go, like I said,

54:03.220 --> 54:04.500
to the Transgender Law Center,

54:04.500 --> 54:07.060
which employs a variety of community-driven strategies

54:07.060 --> 54:09.940
to keep transgender and gender nonconforming people alive,

54:09.940 --> 54:11.780
thriving, and fighting for liberation.

54:11.780 --> 54:14.180
There's some Candle Nights merch on there.

54:14.180 --> 54:15.140
And I know what you're saying.

54:15.140 --> 54:16.260
Wait, isn't Candle Nights?

54:16.260 --> 54:18.180
No, it's never over until it is.

54:18.900 --> 54:21.220
And I guess this year it's January 4th

54:21.220 --> 54:22.500
is when that's gonna end.

54:22.500 --> 54:25.140
Because through January 4th,

54:25.140 --> 54:27.380
all sales of our Candle Nights items

54:27.380 --> 54:29.220
go to benefit Harmony House,

54:29.220 --> 54:32.420
which for anybody who has purchased merch

54:32.420 --> 54:34.180
in the last week or two

54:34.180 --> 54:37.380
and watched the Candle Nights special,

54:37.380 --> 54:39.380
y'all have gone above and beyond

54:39.380 --> 54:40.580
helping us raise money for them.

54:40.580 --> 54:41.940
So thank you again.

54:41.940 --> 54:45.140
All of that available at McRoyMerch.com.

54:45.140 --> 54:46.900
Thank you to John Roderick and Long Winters

54:46.900 --> 54:48.500
for using our theme song into Departure,

54:48.500 --> 54:50.100
the album putting the days to bed.

54:50.100 --> 54:51.220
That one almost got away from me,

54:51.220 --> 54:52.660
but I feel like I grabbed it by the tail

54:52.660 --> 54:54.180
and pulled it right back into the boat, didn't I?

54:54.180 --> 54:54.500
Yeah.

54:54.500 --> 54:56.260
And the other thing is MaximumFun.org.

54:56.260 --> 54:58.100
I wanna thank them too in a big way.

54:58.100 --> 54:59.460
Thanks MaximumFun.org.

54:59.460 --> 55:00.980
And we wanna thank you.

55:00.980 --> 55:02.740
You know, it's been a tough year.

55:02.740 --> 55:03.540
It's been a tough year.

55:03.540 --> 55:04.340
Here, guys.

55:04.340 --> 55:06.420
And in a year as challenging as this one,

55:06.420 --> 55:09.620
I think it's time we explore new Soft Taco opportunities.

55:09.620 --> 55:14.340
Or as I like to call them, Taco-tunities.

55:14.340 --> 55:15.220
Yes, thank you.

55:15.220 --> 55:17.540
This Yahoo was sent in by Connor.

55:17.540 --> 55:19.540
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

55:19.540 --> 55:21.380
who I'm gonna call Morgan.

55:21.380 --> 55:25.700
Asks, how did they move the Statue of Liberty

55:25.700 --> 55:26.820
for Ghostbusters 2?

55:30.500 --> 55:31.700
My name is Justin McElroy.

55:31.700 --> 55:32.980
I'm Travis Adler.

I'm Griffin McElroy.

55:34.500 --> 55:35.460
This has been my brother, my brother,

55:35.460 --> 55:39.780
may kiss your dad's square on the lips.

55:39.780 --> 55:53.780
Hey, girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna?
