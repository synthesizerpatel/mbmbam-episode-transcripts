The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:46.960
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

00:46.960 --> 00:51.200
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:51.840 --> 00:57.440
Hello, I'm Travis McElroy, and I'm running a bit late, so I recorded my part of the intro ahead of

00:57.440 --> 01:02.720
time, and it will be filling in between everyone else's bits. But don't worry, I've done this show

01:02.720 --> 01:09.120
over 500 times, so I'm sure that it will make sense. Weird, it's already off. It's already

01:09.120 --> 01:16.400
weirdly off. It's a shame that- Good one, Griffin. When Travis went to space on the big hero mission

01:16.400 --> 01:22.240
to stop the Hubble from falling on all of us, I thought that was brave of him. I did not think

01:22.240 --> 01:28.800
about it being a scheduling issue. Ross Perot? I haven't heard that name in forever. He told us

01:28.800 --> 01:33.440
to talk about Ross Perot, and we fucking- Okay, let's get this shit back on track. Ross Perot,

01:33.440 --> 01:39.120
I remember that guy. He used to do political stuff. He didn't live to see Elon Musk shoot

01:39.120 --> 01:46.560
several people into space. He's dead? Okay, this is sounding good, actually. No, Travis,

01:46.560 --> 01:54.800
Elon Musk is very much alive. Fuck Elon Musk. Wow, okay. This is interesting, because what did

01:54.800 --> 01:58.720
he think? What bridge did he think we were gonna cross? Where did he think we were gonna go with

01:58.720 --> 02:05.120
that? I know he hates underground magnetic sort of maglev tunnels. That's like a thing he's always

02:05.120 --> 02:12.160
kind of talking about. Travis is half train. Yes. On his mother's side. Yeah, our mom was a train.

02:12.160 --> 02:18.240
Toot toot. Okay. This is fucked up now. It is actually getting a little weird. Travis, are you-

02:18.240 --> 02:22.960
I don't think it's that weird, Justin. Are you here with us, Travis, in the room? Nope, still

02:22.960 --> 02:34.000
prerecorded. Whoa. Travis, give me a sign. Hit me, baby, one more time. Okay. Travis, give me a few

02:34.000 --> 02:51.840
bars of The Sign by Ace of Base. I saw the signs. Okay, so there's not a recording. I opened up my eyes, and I am happy now living without you. Just a few bars. Let you go. Oh, oh, I saw the signs. So did you bail out of your space mission? I opened up my eyes, I saw the signs.

02:51.840 --> 02:55.280
Because you were talking about how you were going to be a brave astronaut and save the whole country

02:55.280 --> 03:01.680
from Hubble. Good one, Griffin. Okay. No, but fucking answer me, because you have been talking

03:01.680 --> 03:04.960
for months about this big brave space mission you're going to go on with all the astronauts.

03:04.960 --> 03:10.240
Do you guys think the Mandalorian also puts a tiny helmet on his penis sometimes just for fun?

03:10.240 --> 03:16.320
Wow, that sucks. Sucks. It sucks. We actually should have pre-listened. Now, I'm thinking that. Like,

03:16.320 --> 03:20.320
I kind of feel like, no, I'm the asshole. You know what I mean? It's weird that he didn't make this

03:20.320 --> 03:25.680
conversational. But it's not weird, because it is Travis, right? It is, yeah. Is he just walking around

03:25.680 --> 03:32.000
hanging brain with his helmet on? In a lot of ways, this is indiscernible from recording a podcast

03:32.000 --> 03:37.440
with live Travis. Yeah, it's not really much of a difference. Interesting. It's worth thinking

03:37.440 --> 03:45.120
about, isn't it? Is there a satellite phone or something we can use to call John Glenn, Houston,

03:45.840 --> 03:51.680
ask them to patch us through? Hey, guys, I'm back. Is this still the recording?

03:51.680 --> 03:57.840
Haha, just kidding. Still pre-recorded. Yeah, fuck off. So I guess Juice and I can

03:58.400 --> 04:04.080
just do this show ourselves. And yeah. God, it would be great to have Travis here, though. Wow,

04:04.080 --> 04:09.600
this bit's going to get a little long in the tooth pretty fast. It feels long. Yeah, it's getting

04:09.600 --> 04:14.640
pretty long in the tooth, huh? Okay, so you're here now, right? Nope, still pre-recorded. Oh,

04:14.640 --> 04:20.640
my God. Okay, I don't like it. I'm going to move on. This is an advice show where we-

04:20.640 --> 04:24.880
I really liked Mamma Mia 2. I don't know what people had against it. Oh, Griffin's pre-recording

04:24.880 --> 04:31.440
now too, or I'm having an episode. One of my mini episodes. PU, my feet stink. Hey, Griffin,

04:31.440 --> 04:45.120
are you back? Yes. I'm not. Do you guys think the Mandalor- Great one, guys. Another great episode.

04:45.120 --> 04:52.080
Squirrel nut zippers. So we have to stop now. We're really dissociating. Okay, I'm back. No,

04:52.080 --> 04:56.560
I'm really back. This is me really back, you guys. I'm really back. How did it go? Pretty bad,

04:56.560 --> 05:03.040
actually. Oh, man. This is an advice show, and I got some advice for you, Travis. I'll give it to

05:03.040 --> 05:09.280
you privately after the show. And cut. Okay, let's go. This is an advice show for the modern era.

05:09.280 --> 05:17.920
I want to gift a handmade oven mitt to my drug dealer for Christmas. I think oven mitts are the

05:17.920 --> 05:22.560
perfect universal gift since everyone uses them, but I don't know what pattern of fabric to use.

05:22.560 --> 05:28.000
The only thing I know about this person is that they both sell and smoke weed. Is a marijuana

05:28.000 --> 05:32.880
print too cliche? What fabric is sure to make my dealer know that I'm actually chill and I only

05:32.880 --> 05:39.600
seem sketchy when we meet because I'm an anxious person that's from weed wearing in Wisconsin?

05:39.600 --> 05:46.400
Huh. Isn't this an indictment of our modern society? All we know about our weed dealers

05:46.400 --> 05:55.360
is weed. It used to be back in 1930, you used to invite your weed dealer to dinner every Sunday,

05:55.360 --> 06:05.920
you know? And you really got to know him, and now this fly by night, just fast paced concrete jungle.

06:06.720 --> 06:13.440
Now, I know you can know certain other things about your dealer. Like, for instance, I know

06:13.440 --> 06:18.800
what kind of car they drive and how much money they like in exchange for marijuana.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.160
Yeah, that's true. Is there anything I can do? Maybe just sort of go with like a

06:22.160 --> 06:27.920
license, a novelty license plate for the kind of car or a key chain that's like,

06:27.920 --> 06:32.320
I'm a Honda man, something like that. What about a picture of their face

06:33.200 --> 06:38.240
on the oven mitt with like their mouth open so it looks like they're biting the hot pan to pull it

06:38.240 --> 06:44.640
out? That's funny and fun. And then, and it gets around a lot of the issues that were discussed

06:44.640 --> 06:51.840
in the message to us. Also, an oven mitt that looks like a crab claw always lands.

06:51.840 --> 06:57.920
That's always good. Maybe you don't have to go so specific. You know what I mean? The oven mitt

06:57.920 --> 07:06.080
I use is a black rubber just tool, a kitchen tool. It's not funny. It doesn't have shit I like on it.

07:06.080 --> 07:11.040
And mine has a photo of Danny DeVito's face with his mouth open that looks like he's biting the pan.

07:11.040 --> 07:14.720
Yeah. And it has a little sound chip in it. So when you grab it, he goes,

07:14.720 --> 07:20.800
ah, it's hot on my mouth. Someone pass me some limoncello to cool this off.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.840
Exactly. Hey, what about gingham?

07:24.640 --> 07:28.080
Huh? It's a classic, you know, nice gingham.

07:28.800 --> 07:33.840
Gingham fits in so many different, uh, different kitchen styles. You don't know what kind of kitchen.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.000
You know what it fits Justin? Yeah. What?

07:36.000 --> 07:36.800
Gingham style.

07:39.920 --> 07:43.440
Ope, ope, ope, ope, ope, ope. Gingham style.

07:43.440 --> 07:51.120
Yeah. Sometimes it's like a contest to see how long we can go to just let the fart kind of settle.

07:52.320 --> 07:56.080
To just get, because a lot of the times when there are three hosts on a podcast and one of

07:56.080 --> 08:01.120
them just like really rips a beaver of a joke, the other two will immediately jump in to try

08:01.120 --> 08:07.120
and distract or light a candle or try to wave it away or open a window or something. But sometimes

08:07.120 --> 08:11.840
it seems like sometimes it seems, oh man, another one aftershocks. It seems like the two of us are

08:11.840 --> 08:18.480
sometimes willing to marinate, just as an experiment against our listeners.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.320
Well, against ourselves too. Cause there is pride. There's ego on the line.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.640
Well, and money. And money, Justin. A lot of people forget about that.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.480
Our family's living. Yeah, our family's living.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.240
But we're willing to put it all on the line to marinate.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.480
You guys get it? Cause it's like the, it's like Psy.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.960
We fucking get it, Travis. It sounds like gingham.

08:32.960 --> 08:33.360
It's not.

08:34.080 --> 08:37.760
It's, it's, it's 2020. Psy is long dead.

08:37.760 --> 08:42.960
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Graham Roebuck. Thank you, Graham.

08:42.960 --> 08:47.120
It's Yahoo Answers user anonymous. I'm going to call them, uh, Chevy asks,

08:48.320 --> 08:52.560
my upstairs neighbor pretends not to be the one playing the trombone at night. What do I do?

08:53.280 --> 08:56.560
About once a week for two months now, someone has been playing a trombone in our building.

08:56.560 --> 09:00.560
It came from above and was very loud. So I suspected my direct upstairs neighbor.

09:00.560 --> 09:06.000
I rang his bell once in the beginning and he came to my door all quote sleepy and quote upset.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.920
Telling me it wasn't him. And why now I was also not letting him sleep. I felt so sorry,

09:11.920 --> 09:15.440
but now I saw him playing it in the reflection of the window across the street.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.520
He's a stone cold liar. What could I do?

09:17.520 --> 09:24.800
Huh? I, I was not anticipating that reveal of I've seen him doing it.

09:25.520 --> 09:32.560
This is, there are probably bolder lies that you could tell in this life that we are all sort of

09:32.560 --> 09:37.360
sharing together, but I can't think of a bigger one. I can't think of a bigger lie than

09:37.360 --> 09:50.240
are you playing trombone? No, I was actually asleep. See, my ears are,

09:50.240 --> 09:56.400
have a lot of waxy buildup in a way that negates trombone sound waves.

09:56.400 --> 10:00.800
Now here's the thing though. Here's I will. Oh, here's the thing though, Griffin.

10:00.800 --> 10:04.080
Yeah. Maybe, just maybe.

10:04.080 --> 10:08.720
Maybe. It's unrelated. Maybe he was playing it during the day

10:08.720 --> 10:11.120
because he has a trombone that he plays during the day.

10:11.840 --> 10:15.200
Oh, I see. And there's more than one trombone on earth.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.920
And if we can all acknowledge that universal truth.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.800
I've seen more than one. I've seen more than one in the room at the same time.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.800
Thank you. I played trombone in band and there were at least two other kids in middle school

10:24.800 --> 10:28.480
who played it too. So there are three trombones on this earth.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.760
Now, if you get them together and play at the same time, God.

10:31.760 --> 10:36.320
The walls of Jericho will come tumbling down.

10:36.320 --> 10:43.200
That is why each of me and Chris and I believe Hunter, we all learned one third of the song

10:43.200 --> 10:45.840
and would just trade off who was playing at any given time.

10:45.840 --> 10:50.160
Not because we were lazy, but to protect the universe itself.

10:50.160 --> 10:54.720
So I'm saying maybe Upstairs Neighbor plays during the daytime for fun.

10:54.720 --> 11:00.480
And knowing this, somebody is trying to frame him by playing at night.

11:00.480 --> 11:06.720
I see. So you're saying that the neighbor could bring out their trombone to show you that it is solar powered.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.040
So the idea of him being- Oh, it's too cold.

11:09.040 --> 11:15.680
It's too cold for me to play it. I need the heat of the sun upon the brass in order to produce sound with it.

11:15.680 --> 11:19.680
This is super bone and he can only play with the power of the earth's yellow sun.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.520
This is Boktai, the trombone.

11:21.520 --> 11:25.120
Jesus, that's a deep one.

11:25.120 --> 11:37.360
This is so- I feel like you have a sort of unofficial warrant to conduct a sort of citizen's arrest investigation.

11:37.360 --> 11:42.800
A citizen's breaking and entering warrant. Is that anything?

11:42.800 --> 11:46.640
A citizen's arrest, because it's music.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.160
Arrest.

11:48.160 --> 11:51.120
I thought we did talk about this once already.

11:51.120 --> 11:55.440
You know what, even as I was saying it- You knew it was bad when you were saying it.

11:55.440 --> 12:00.640
Maybe he's not lying and maybe he was sleep tromboning.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.640
Interesting.

12:02.640 --> 12:07.600
Yeah, he's been practicing for the big concert, I guess, coming up.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.840
The big solo trombone concert.

12:09.840 --> 12:14.000
He's got that big trombone solo in the middle of that Squirrel Nut Zippers song.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.960
And maybe he plays with the Squirrel Nut Zippers or the Brian Setzer Orchestra.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.480
I assume they're still going.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.600
One of those two.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.960
And he's had it in his head now for a while.

12:24.960 --> 12:28.240
And now when he sleeps, it's all I can think about.

12:28.240 --> 12:33.600
And he rises still asleep from his bed, blasts out that solo.

12:33.600 --> 12:38.240
And then you knocked on his door and he was like, why is this guy waking me up?

12:38.240 --> 12:40.880
I mean, it doesn't even have to be him dream tromboning.

12:40.880 --> 12:47.200
In his dream, he could be blowing on a big foot long hot dog to cool it off.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.400
Oh, that's true, yeah.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.880
Or something else of a sexual nature.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.000
It could be one of those things.

12:52.000 --> 12:58.480
And you don't even know that that's what you're actually playing a trombone in real life.

12:58.480 --> 13:03.760
Now, I will say as someone who admittedly barely played the trombone for about two years

13:03.760 --> 13:10.080
in middle school, if you're doing something of a sexual nature at all with the same method

13:10.080 --> 13:13.520
you play a trombone, something has gone horribly wrong.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.200
Not great.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.040
None of those movements match.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.360
Yeah, especially the arm movement.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.400
That's bad.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.680
Arm movement's not good.

13:21.680 --> 13:25.680
The necessitation of an embouchure?

13:25.680 --> 13:26.000
Yep.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.280
Also, it's not necessary, not great.

13:29.280 --> 13:35.280
In any separate piece, the arm movement, the blowing, the embouchure, any of those individually,

13:35.280 --> 13:37.680
I could see that working and somebody enjoying it.

13:37.680 --> 13:40.240
All three at the same time?

13:40.240 --> 13:44.640
The only person who's going to enjoy that is somebody who is just tromboned from the

13:44.640 --> 13:48.240
waist down.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.200
Go ahead, Griff.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.520
Just their bottom half got blowed up in an accident.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.400
And now it's trombone.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.360
Now it's a trombone down there.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.080
Go ahead, Justin.

13:54.080 --> 13:54.960
Now, Justin, go ahead.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.640
Once you crack into the spit valve, now you're really cooking.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.720
Yeah, but it's really hard to do the spit valve while you're playing, Justin.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.280
That's why there shouldn't be music in schools.

14:06.000 --> 14:13.440
Because you cannot give eighth graders a big metal tube armed with a single button

14:13.440 --> 14:18.880
that when you press it, it will dump a not insignificant amount of spit in your reaction.

14:18.880 --> 14:22.480
It's just a sort of musical teen blowhole, if you will.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.200
Yeah, this is a valve on brass instruments.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.480
If you don't know, it's a real thing.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.800
You press it and all the spit falls out.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.080
You cannot give this technology to eighth graders.

14:32.080 --> 14:32.880
You cannot.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.680
It makes school hell for me.

14:35.680 --> 14:40.400
It's also a rare, complicated machine that still exists and has not been improved upon,

14:40.400 --> 14:43.920
in which you might say, oh, the problem with it is it's too full of spit.

14:43.920 --> 14:47.120
The only other thing that exists in is dentistry.

14:47.120 --> 14:47.620
Yeah.

14:48.800 --> 14:49.920
How about another question?

14:49.920 --> 14:53.840
My wife and I recently celebrated our anniversary, which was lovely,

14:53.840 --> 14:56.320
except for one thing that I need a judgment call on.

14:56.320 --> 15:00.720
I wish, can I say, we used to tell people like, this is just an anecdote.

15:00.720 --> 15:01.760
You don't need any advice.

15:01.760 --> 15:09.040
As we get older and I feel less qualified to advise people,

15:09.040 --> 15:11.840
I wish we had more questions that were just like, judge this.

15:11.840 --> 15:12.340
Yeah.

15:12.340 --> 15:20.240
I feel like I'm more qualified now as a 40-year-old man to be judgmental than I am to be nurturing.

15:20.240 --> 15:20.740
Oh, yeah.

15:20.740 --> 15:21.840
I need a judgment call.

15:22.800 --> 15:27.040
Somehow in the planning of our celebration, it became clear to me

15:27.040 --> 15:30.720
that my wife remembered the wrong date for our anniversary.

15:30.720 --> 15:36.080
I was going to point this out, but then I remembered that this year our real actual date

15:36.080 --> 15:41.200
was taking place on top of something that I wanted to take part in virtually.

15:41.200 --> 15:48.320
So I just kind of rolled with the wrong date and we celebrated early.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.000
No harm, no foul, right?

15:50.000 --> 15:54.160
Well, now the day is here and we're getting cards and congratulations from relatives

15:54.160 --> 15:59.520
who have annoyingly accurate calendar reminders and I'm not really sure what to do.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.520
Do I fess up?

16:01.520 --> 16:04.800
Do I play goalie and block the cards for the day?

16:04.800 --> 16:08.640
Do I feign getting the day wrong myself?

16:08.640 --> 16:12.640
Do we laugh at our relatives for getting the day wrong, et cetera?

16:13.200 --> 16:15.040
Bit of a pickle, this one.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.880
That's from no way I'm putting my name on this.

16:18.880 --> 16:27.280
Just generally speaking as a rule, I feel like your wife remembered the wrong date

16:27.280 --> 16:30.640
for your anniversary, that's a whoopsie.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.400
That's a mistake, right?

16:32.400 --> 16:37.840
And then you kind of just rolling with it because you wanted to take part in this virtual event.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.200
You wanted to do a wow raid.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.720
You needed to do a wow raid for the big drops.

16:42.720 --> 16:47.440
You got Shadowlands coming up soon, you got to get fucking best in slot, baby.

16:48.080 --> 16:52.880
But then the problem is that you both had one whoopsie at that point.

16:52.880 --> 16:56.000
It was an even distribution of whoopsies and uh-ohs.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.280
But then you, it seems like there was a slippery slope where it's like,

16:59.280 --> 17:03.760
oh, we're starting to get cards, I need to do a whoopsie on these cards

17:03.760 --> 17:06.720
and throw them in the trash.

17:06.720 --> 17:10.080
And then I need to change all our G-cals.

17:10.080 --> 17:12.800
And then I need to make fun of my parents for getting it wrong.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.480
It's a sort of continuation of the whoopsies that makes it think like,

17:16.480 --> 17:20.320
hey, you're probably doing the baddest, wrongest thing here.

17:20.320 --> 17:23.120
A little bit, maybe, a little, don't you think?

17:23.120 --> 17:27.760
You should just come clean because it will, here's the thing.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.240
As Griffin has pointed out, I think the whoopsies are balanced.

17:31.520 --> 17:34.080
They got, they were, correct.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.920
They got the date wrong.

17:35.920 --> 17:38.640
And you said, oh, that works for me, scheduling wise.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.480
And you went with it, right?

17:40.480 --> 17:44.640
And so now let me be honest, what you should have done is said,

17:44.640 --> 17:48.160
no, darling, our anniversary is actually two days after that.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.920
And let's do something almost all day.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.960
And I will take one hour for this raid that I need to do.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.440
That's bad, that sucks actually.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.880
No, no, no, it's bad.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.360
But you know that what they did was worse, right?

18:01.360 --> 18:02.160
We all know that.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.560
I kind of feel like if you're good, we all lie.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.360
Everybody needs to lie to get through the day.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.040
We all lie.

18:11.040 --> 18:15.440
But I think before you do a lie, before you do a little Feborosky,

18:15.440 --> 18:18.480
you need to, you should make it mandatory

18:18.480 --> 18:23.920
that you need to visualize telling the other person about the lie.

18:23.920 --> 18:28.000
That you need to be able to, if you're going to do the lie,

18:28.800 --> 18:31.840
you need to mentally walk through the pain.

18:31.840 --> 18:36.080
You have to have a plan for dismantling the lie.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.760
There has to be a way to walk it back.

18:37.760 --> 18:38.880
You have to have the pattern.

18:38.880 --> 18:42.080
You're like a little Hansel and Gretel in the forest of deception.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.680
You got to leave yourself a little breadcrumb trail

18:43.680 --> 18:46.480
of how to get back to truth and honesty.

18:47.120 --> 18:51.600
You had to have walked through in your head and said,

18:51.600 --> 18:54.480
well, yeah, see, you got it wrong.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.840
And then I didn't correct you

18:55.840 --> 18:59.680
because I had to get that best in slot Fury Warrior DPS gear.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.080
So that is what happened.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.000
And there's the truth for you.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.280
Okay, I feel terrible

19:05.280 --> 19:07.840
because I think we're starting to border on like gaslighting.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.600
Yeah, don't do that.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.160
Clearly, don't do that.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, but.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.160
Unless.

19:14.160 --> 19:14.800
No.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

19:16.400 --> 19:16.900
Trust.

19:17.920 --> 19:18.880
Unless.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.120
Could you somehow blame it on daylight?

19:21.120 --> 19:22.160
Are you kidding me?

19:22.160 --> 19:23.600
I set you up for a fucking unless

19:23.600 --> 19:26.400
and you tried to swoop my unless with your own fucking unless?

19:26.400 --> 19:27.360
Unless!

19:27.360 --> 19:29.360
We got rules here, unless.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.080
Unless.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.440
You can say you didn't correct her

19:31.440 --> 19:32.560
because you didn't want her to feel bad.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.280
Justin, do you maybe, here, I'll set up the unless

19:35.280 --> 19:37.360
and then Justin, do you maybe want to swoop the unless?

19:37.360 --> 19:38.480
Because Travis just did it twice.

19:38.480 --> 19:40.000
You technically could do two.

19:40.000 --> 19:40.480
I don't.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.440
I'll go see if Rachel wants to go swoop my unless.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.080
Let me go grab her.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.440
Maybe I'll go grab my son

19:45.440 --> 19:47.600
because he would show about the same amount of decorum

19:47.600 --> 19:49.840
that Travis just showed when he swooped my unless

19:49.840 --> 19:51.520
two different times.

19:51.520 --> 19:52.400
Unless.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.480
She got the date wrong on purpose

19:54.480 --> 19:56.320
because she was doing a wow raid.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.640
She's Weed Man 420.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.920
She is Weed Man 420, Brave Paladin.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.040
Hero of the land.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.480
If you like skipping anniversaries

20:11.120 --> 20:12.960
to get your best in slot gear

20:14.480 --> 20:16.400
if you want to get a new cloak

20:16.400 --> 20:19.040
if you found your lover right here

20:20.560 --> 20:22.640
and then in the wet raid, you're like, huh?

20:23.760 --> 20:24.480
Vicky?

20:24.480 --> 20:27.440
Come clean and apologize the shit out of it.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.760
What are you apologizing the shit out of?

20:29.760 --> 20:35.120
Vicky, first off, your AOEs were mistimed.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.080
Whoa, a bold opener.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.160
Your AOEs were mistimed.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.360
Gotta get your dots in order

20:41.360 --> 20:42.960
but also I love you so much.

20:42.960 --> 20:43.520
I love you so much.

20:43.520 --> 20:44.720
I'm so glad we could share this.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.320
I always wondered what you did in your office

20:46.320 --> 20:47.600
with the door locked and now I know.

20:47.600 --> 20:51.120
It was play with me in World of Warcraft.

20:51.120 --> 20:54.320
I'm gonna roll for need on your heart and your love.

20:54.320 --> 20:54.880
I need it.

20:54.880 --> 20:55.760
Give me your heart.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.480
Give me a cyber kiss and come give me a flesh kiss

20:58.480 --> 21:01.440
because we're just on opposite into the office right now.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.840
We really need to pay better attention to things.

21:04.560 --> 21:05.040
You know what?

21:05.040 --> 21:07.280
Maybe this is where we learn to put down the,

21:07.280 --> 21:08.480
oh wait, no, sorry.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.320
I just started doing an incense.

21:10.320 --> 21:11.040
Sorry, give me a second.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.080
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.200
Just my timer went up.

21:13.200 --> 21:18.160
Hey, Vicki, I'm LFG looking for a girlfriend.

21:19.040 --> 21:19.520
They're married.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.120
We're actually married.

21:21.120 --> 21:21.840
You are what?

21:21.840 --> 21:23.440
Vicki, come back.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.640
Wait, come back, please.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.440
I'm so sorry.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.200
I did misspeak.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.080
We are married.

21:28.080 --> 21:28.720
That is true.

21:28.720 --> 21:29.520
I'm sorry, Vicki.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.760
I'm gonna turn off LFG.

21:32.400 --> 21:36.640
I'm LFG looking for a good husband to be one to you.

21:37.760 --> 21:38.960
Now would you like a mount?

21:39.680 --> 21:41.520
But the dots really are shitty.

21:41.520 --> 21:45.280
And Travis made a sexual joke,

21:45.280 --> 21:48.080
and I didn't think that that was the right time for it.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.640
Like if me and Rachel Piña Colada each other,

21:51.200 --> 21:52.960
and we laughed it off like, ha ha ha ha.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.360
And then I was like, but let's party.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.560
Like I feel like that's,

21:57.120 --> 21:58.640
I guess though that song is about,

21:58.640 --> 22:01.040
let's, we're trying to cheat on each other,

22:01.040 --> 22:03.120
but then we cheat on each other with each other.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.360
Everything's okay.

22:06.480 --> 22:09.040
Yeah, this is the thing that I've actually been thinking

22:09.040 --> 22:10.320
about Piña Colada's song.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.120
Yeah, go off.

22:11.120 --> 22:11.920
Whatever the summer.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.680
Go off, ping.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.000
If you're a kid, a youngin,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.400
it's about somebody who puts a personal ad in the newspaper

22:18.400 --> 22:20.320
for the kind of lover they want to take

22:20.320 --> 22:22.480
because they're bored of their current lover.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.880
And then someone answers the ad,

22:24.880 --> 22:27.040
and it turns out that it is their current lover

22:27.040 --> 22:29.600
who apparently liked other things they thought

22:29.600 --> 22:31.680
that their lover didn't like, but actually does.

22:32.400 --> 22:35.440
And then they are like, well, I guess we're still together.

22:35.440 --> 22:40.800
That's not, the next like couple months of that relationship

22:40.800 --> 22:42.160
is not a happy story of,

22:42.160 --> 22:44.000
I'm so glad you told me you like champagne.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.040
We're both deeply unhappy.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.440
We're deeply and profoundly unhappy with each other

22:49.440 --> 22:51.520
in lots of large and small ways.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.720
And I don't feel like it's a happy ending necessarily.

22:54.720 --> 22:57.360
But Justin, they found in each other

22:57.360 --> 22:59.440
the unhappiness that clicked.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.920
You know, it's like your unhappiness is like my unhappiness,

23:01.920 --> 23:03.680
so might as well be unhappy together.

23:03.680 --> 23:07.280
But it turns out we like all the same stuff

23:07.280 --> 23:09.920
that I guess we're just not doing.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.720
I wish there was one about kink.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.200
That would be fucking great.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.080
Wouldn't that be good?

23:17.040 --> 23:18.240
I want a new version of that song

23:18.240 --> 23:19.440
that's just about different kink

23:19.440 --> 23:20.720
that you don't think your partner's into.

23:20.720 --> 23:21.120
And then they answer it.

23:21.120 --> 23:23.360
Do you like bondage and hentai?

23:23.360 --> 23:24.800
There we go, exactly.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.320
Do you like wiener-based pain?

23:28.320 --> 23:35.760
If you like eating old shoes, I'm not sure that's a thing.

23:35.760 --> 23:45.760
Let's head to the mic.

23:45.760 --> 23:51.360
Hey, nerd, do you want to fucking build a website?

23:51.360 --> 23:52.400
Yeah, you do.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.360
Get out of here with your wimpy websites

23:55.360 --> 23:56.880
and get a cool beer.

23:56.880 --> 24:00.240
Beefy websites and get a cool beefy website from Squarespace.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.480
What's a wimpy website look like, Chico?

24:02.480 --> 24:03.440
I'm not done.

24:03.440 --> 24:03.840
Okay.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.640
Has the neighborhood bully been picking on your website?

24:06.640 --> 24:10.000
Then you need to get beefy and kick the internet sand

24:10.000 --> 24:11.440
right back in that bully's face.

24:12.080 --> 24:16.240
You can get a beefy muscle website from Squarespace.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.200
Squarespace is the fucking drill bit tailor

24:19.920 --> 24:22.000
of website making app.

24:22.000 --> 24:22.960
Hell yeah, my dude.

24:23.840 --> 24:25.440
This website is swole

24:25.440 --> 24:27.200
and it could showcase your work,

24:27.200 --> 24:29.200
sell products and services of all kind,

24:29.200 --> 24:32.240
promote your physical or online business and more.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.480
And that more is beat up their bully

24:35.040 --> 24:38.160
with beautiful customizable templates

24:38.160 --> 24:39.920
created by world-class designers.

24:48.560 --> 24:52.400
free and secure hosting and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.200
But your bully will need to patch up their wounds

24:55.200 --> 24:59.440
so go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.880

25:06.160 --> 25:08.160
Squarespace, we'll kill your bully.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.800
I don't think that they want,

25:10.800 --> 25:12.080
they don't necessarily want that.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.120
I don't think that's actually-

25:13.120 --> 25:13.760
We'll kill you.

25:13.760 --> 25:16.480
We've killed before and we'll do it again, motherfucker.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.040
Oh, that's better.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.960
Maybe it's something like we've killed bullies.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.800
They're not necessarily saying like-

25:20.800 --> 25:22.560
Squarespace, we've killed bullies.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.400
Yeah, you can't prove it though.

25:24.960 --> 25:25.760
Well, they did just-

25:25.760 --> 25:27.040
Double jeopardy.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.320
That's actually works here.

25:28.320 --> 25:31.280
Audible's up next and they said specifically

25:31.280 --> 25:33.840
not to say that they have killed before,

25:33.840 --> 25:35.760
we'll kill again, whether or not it's a bully,

25:35.760 --> 25:39.520
a bad guy, you know, the Joker, like whatever,

25:39.520 --> 25:41.120
even like the baddest dude.

25:41.120 --> 25:41.840
But what they do have-

25:41.840 --> 25:43.280
You don't think Audible would kill the Joker?

25:44.240 --> 25:45.920
Yeah, actually, you know what I said?

25:45.920 --> 25:47.040
Actually, that should be a screening question

25:47.040 --> 25:47.680
for advertisers.

25:47.680 --> 25:48.160
Yeah.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.920
Like if given the opportunity, would you kill it?

25:49.920 --> 25:53.360
Would you finish the business that Batman is unwilling to?

25:53.360 --> 25:55.600
And a lot of people would be like,

25:55.600 --> 25:56.960
what version of the Joker?

25:56.960 --> 25:59.440
And if you have to say that,

25:59.440 --> 26:01.360
like if you have to couch it like that,

26:01.360 --> 26:03.120
you've already lost our endorsement.

26:03.120 --> 26:06.080
Because at a certain point, Batman's just not doing it

26:06.080 --> 26:07.920
and the blood on the Joker's hands

26:07.920 --> 26:09.760
is on Batman's hands too, right?

26:09.760 --> 26:10.320
Oh, yes.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.800
For ages now, yes.

26:12.800 --> 26:16.000
I'm not saying that I am for the death penalty,

26:16.000 --> 26:17.600
except for the Joker.

26:17.600 --> 26:18.880
Joker's the only one I want to kill.

26:18.880 --> 26:19.360
Right?

26:19.360 --> 26:21.120
Like really, really, really bad.

26:21.120 --> 26:22.480
Even like the fucking Adam West,

26:22.480 --> 26:23.840
like I'm a silly clown.

26:24.480 --> 26:26.000
Fucking get him!

26:26.560 --> 26:27.040
Get him!

26:27.040 --> 26:28.560
That fool, right?

26:28.560 --> 26:31.520
You know, if you take your eyes off him for three seconds,

26:31.520 --> 26:33.520
he's killed 18 more people.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.560
That's on you.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.320
He's not coming back from this.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.600
Even when he doesn't kill 18 people,

26:37.600 --> 26:39.760
he's causing so much mischief in me.

26:39.760 --> 26:40.160
Oh, yeah.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.080
He's the clown prince of chaos.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.040
You know what I mean?

26:43.040 --> 26:43.360
He's like-

26:43.360 --> 26:44.160
Talk about Audible.

26:44.160 --> 26:44.800
Okay, right.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.080
Yeah, they do audio books

26:46.080 --> 26:50.800
and they're super, super good to listen to.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.520
Now, when we're all a little bit cooped up,

26:53.520 --> 26:57.040
they got a lot of spoken word entertainment,

26:57.040 --> 26:58.400
they have Audible originals,

26:58.400 --> 27:00.000
they have daily news digests,

27:00.000 --> 27:03.360
and they have soothing audio experiences

27:03.360 --> 27:04.640
to help you drift to sleep.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.040
And anyone with children at home

27:07.040 --> 27:09.120
can use stories.audible.com

27:09.120 --> 27:10.720
where anyone anywhere can stream

27:10.720 --> 27:13.760
hundreds of ad-free, hand-picked Audible titles

27:13.760 --> 27:16.160
completely free, no strings attached.

27:16.160 --> 27:19.920
It's a great way of hearing the kind of stories

27:19.920 --> 27:20.800
or news that you want to hear

27:20.800 --> 27:23.600
without being locked to a screen

27:23.600 --> 27:25.840
because, God, we're all getting so much screen time,

27:25.840 --> 27:27.680
maybe even a little bit too much.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.120
Maybe a bit too much.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.120
Maybe just even a little bit too much screen time.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.720
So why don't you have ear time?

27:33.440 --> 27:34.560
Why not have sounds time?

27:34.560 --> 27:36.160
Why not have sounds time instead?

27:36.880 --> 27:38.400
Check out Audible right now

27:38.400 --> 27:40.720
by visiting audible.com slash brother

27:40.720 --> 27:42.800
or text brother to 500-500.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.120
That's audible.com slash brother.

27:46.480 --> 27:47.840
Okay, here's what I'm saying.

27:47.840 --> 27:51.120
Batman knows people that kill people a lot, right?

27:51.120 --> 27:53.680
So even if Batman is unwilling to do it,

27:53.680 --> 27:56.320
he could facilitate it easier.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.960
Where is his line, right?

27:58.960 --> 28:01.600
Like his line in the sand of morality,

28:01.600 --> 28:05.760
it seems pretty flexible up till a certain point.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.720
And he's like, oh, I arbitrarily draw the line

28:08.720 --> 28:10.480
at killing for some reason,

28:10.480 --> 28:12.240
even though the joke, oh, fuck.

28:12.240 --> 28:16.240
What if Bruce Wayne hired Deadshot to kill the Joker?

28:16.240 --> 28:16.560
Right.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.440
This is still part of the Audible ad copy.

28:20.240 --> 28:20.880
I'm just saying.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.960
We're really over-delivering on the value end of this ad.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.320
This is a very long ad.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.920
They've got stories for children,

28:28.480 --> 28:30.080
and they also have a detailed plan

28:30.080 --> 28:31.920
on how Batman could ethically kill,

28:31.920 --> 28:33.040
terminate the Joker's life.

28:33.040 --> 28:33.540
Thank you.

28:34.400 --> 28:37.680
Sometimes inaction alone would have allowed it to happen.

28:37.680 --> 28:38.960
Still part of a copy.

28:38.960 --> 28:39.280
Right?

28:39.280 --> 28:43.200
It's like Batman opted not only to not kill Joker,

28:43.200 --> 28:45.600
but to not allow Joker to die.

28:45.600 --> 28:46.720
A lot of hand wringing here.

28:46.720 --> 28:49.280
His unwillingness to kill the Joker,

28:49.280 --> 28:51.680
I think at this point, it's hard.

28:51.680 --> 28:55.120
It's becoming, I'm not a fan of capital punishment.

28:55.120 --> 28:56.400
I'm not, obviously.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.160
Let me just say that upfront.

29:00.160 --> 29:03.520
That said, Batman's unwillingness to kill the,

29:03.520 --> 29:06.240
maybe inability, honestly, at this point.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.840
His unwillingness to kill the Joker,

29:07.840 --> 29:10.000
it's like a trolley problem,

29:10.720 --> 29:13.600
but on one end, there's a bajillion people,

29:13.600 --> 29:16.000
and on the other end, there's a jail cell

29:16.000 --> 29:18.320
that is open in both the front and the back,

29:19.040 --> 29:21.120
and a million other people beyond that.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.640
So that's basically what you're,

29:22.640 --> 29:25.280
you're either letting them plow into a bunch of people,

29:25.920 --> 29:28.960
or cruise through a jail cell,

29:29.520 --> 29:30.880
and then go kill some other people.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.640
And the track is lined with people.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.080
Oh.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.360
Is someone gonna answer that?

29:35.360 --> 29:36.640
Oh, hello?

29:36.640 --> 29:37.140
Hello?

29:37.920 --> 29:39.760
Hey, boys, it's me, Bob Kerrigan,

29:39.760 --> 29:42.000
CEO of Audible, and I just wanted to say,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.880
you guys did a bang-up job with that ad spot.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.360
You said all the things that we needed you to say

29:47.360 --> 29:50.160
about the stories and the great audiobooks

29:50.160 --> 29:52.400
that people could have delivered to them,

29:52.400 --> 29:55.520
and you said the stuff about Ears Time,

29:55.520 --> 29:56.560
and I loved that,

29:56.560 --> 29:58.640
but then, where you really landed the plane,

29:58.640 --> 29:59.760
I gotta tell you, boys,

30:00.320 --> 30:01.840
was how you let everybody know

30:01.840 --> 30:05.280
how Batman could ethically kill the Joker

30:05.280 --> 30:07.200
and end his life and his reign of crime.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.400
And that's important to me,

30:08.400 --> 30:10.560
Bob Kerrigan, CEO of Audible.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.560
Hey, Bob, Bob, can I ask you a question?

30:12.560 --> 30:13.440
Yeah, please go ahead.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.800
Why do you think at this point,

30:14.800 --> 30:17.840
Batman hasn't just cut off one of Joker's legs?

30:17.840 --> 30:19.120
Well, Travis, you'll see that

30:19.120 --> 30:20.880
if you continue reading the ad copy.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.840
I do have a sort of a second branch of ideas here

30:23.840 --> 30:24.720
of just sort of-

30:24.720 --> 30:26.400
Oh, it does say, it says right here,

30:26.400 --> 30:28.160
why not chop him right in half?

30:28.160 --> 30:28.640
Love, Bob.

30:28.640 --> 30:29.920
Chop him in half, and then, yeah,

30:29.920 --> 30:33.840
and then let him waste away on the dirty ground.

30:33.840 --> 30:34.080
Yeah.

30:34.080 --> 30:34.960
Just a macro here?

30:34.960 --> 30:35.840
Go right ahead.

30:35.840 --> 30:39.200
Don't you think at the end of every Joker story in Batman,

30:39.200 --> 30:40.720
there should be a prolonged sequence

30:40.720 --> 30:44.080
where Batman is investigating Arkham Asylum to see-

30:44.080 --> 30:45.200
Why they're so bad.

30:45.200 --> 30:45.440
Yeah.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.120
Just some of the different-

30:47.120 --> 30:49.680
Why the whole jail is made of Swiss cheese, apparently.

30:49.680 --> 30:50.160
Yeah.

30:50.160 --> 30:52.080
Yeah, you can see I have a lot, actually,

30:52.080 --> 30:55.280
in this sort of book of an email I sent to you, boys,

30:55.280 --> 30:57.120
with all the ad copy points.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.480
And then if you keep reading,

30:58.480 --> 31:01.360
it reveals our big plans in 2021 to have-

31:01.360 --> 31:03.440
I'm having to delete some stuff to make room for this.

31:03.440 --> 31:04.480
Oh, no, I like this.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.200
You put-

31:05.200 --> 31:08.560
There's an additional PDF here that just says Bob Thoughts.

31:08.560 --> 31:09.280
Bob Thoughts, yeah.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.080
And so if you read that,

31:10.080 --> 31:12.400
there's some good stuff in there like yelling books.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.880
And it's like audio books where we scream them

31:14.880 --> 31:16.320
as loud as we can at you.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.080
The one I really like here, though, in Bob Thoughts,

31:18.080 --> 31:19.120
is you've put,

31:19.120 --> 31:22.560
why not put him in a permanent coma, question mark?

31:22.560 --> 31:25.520
Well, I actually misspelled the word cone.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.360
Oh, put the joke in a cone like a dog cone?

31:29.360 --> 31:30.880
Like a big dog cone, yeah.

31:30.880 --> 31:33.600
And then I feel like that would really hamper his ability to do-

31:33.600 --> 31:34.240
It really would.

31:34.240 --> 31:37.120
I believe it really makes him less scary.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.320
God, I hate the Joker.

31:38.320 --> 31:39.120
I really do.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.080
Yeah, we all do.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.360
I really hate that man.

31:43.040 --> 31:47.360
I can remember as a child thinking it was odd

31:47.360 --> 31:50.080
that here was this can full of meat.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.280
I'm Jesse Thorne.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.280
This week on my show Bullseye,

31:53.280 --> 31:57.920
David Letterman on shame, regret, and canned hams.

31:57.920 --> 32:02.640
Is this the best delivery version of pork?

32:02.640 --> 32:06.720
That's this week on Bullseye for MaximumFun.org and NPR.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.600
Oh, yes.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.680
I started doing it before I'm even sure if I want to do this.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.180
Cool.

32:16.800 --> 32:17.840
I want a munch.

32:17.840 --> 32:20.240
Squash.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.120
Munchquad Jr.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.280
I have a brief, I have two brief notes.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.480
This is just two brief notes.

32:25.680 --> 32:28.880
The first is that Krispy Kreme has introduced a new caramel glaze.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.360
This is such a Munchquad Jr.

32:31.360 --> 32:34.640
I'm not even going to bring Count Donut out

32:34.640 --> 32:37.520
for their Count Party Bagel if you prefer out for this one.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.640
I just want to read you the first line of this.

32:40.640 --> 32:41.920
I miss him so much.

32:41.920 --> 32:42.420
I know.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.760
Ask the world of donuts to do better.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.720
Krispy Kreme introduces new caramel glaze.

32:49.360 --> 32:49.840
Cool.

32:49.840 --> 32:50.400
Wait, sorry.

32:51.040 --> 32:55.520
Was the first line ask the world's donuts to do better or is that?

32:55.520 --> 32:55.840
No, no, no.

32:55.840 --> 32:56.480
Oh, okay.

32:56.480 --> 32:57.840
That was being editorialized.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.960
I thought that's what they were leading off their press release with.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.280
Krispy Kreme introduces new caramel glaze.

33:03.280 --> 33:03.600
Okay.

33:03.600 --> 33:04.100
Yeah.

33:04.640 --> 33:07.520
Krispy Kreme is helping fans melt away from 2020

33:08.160 --> 33:10.320
and into a delicious and creamy world

33:10.320 --> 33:12.880
by introducing an all new glaze flavor, caramel.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.920
Hey, are you?

33:17.840 --> 33:20.480
Are you guys doing okay in marketing?

33:20.480 --> 33:22.320
Are things going all right for you?

33:22.320 --> 33:26.240
I mean, I know they've been bad for us here in the real world for a while,

33:26.240 --> 33:31.120
but I can't read fucking Munch Squads anymore without them being like,

33:33.200 --> 33:36.720
everyone sounds like fucking Lobo waking up from a three-day drunk.

33:36.720 --> 33:37.760
It's miserable.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.240
Everyone is so miserable.

33:40.240 --> 33:42.560
God, this year fucking dookie, right?

33:42.560 --> 33:46.160
Anyway, we got some new caramel party bagels for you.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.200
Is that anything?

33:47.760 --> 33:48.480
Are you happy?

33:49.120 --> 33:51.840
It's very evocative though because they've handled it in a different way,

33:51.840 --> 33:54.720
which is like melt away into a different world.

33:54.720 --> 33:59.520
They make it sound like if you can somehow climb through the whole of the donut

33:59.520 --> 34:02.000
without breaking the bread completely,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.800
it'll take you to fucking donut Narnia.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.000
Well, here's what they don't tell you.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.120
Take a bite of this party bagel and that caramel glaze.

34:09.120 --> 34:11.600
It flows right into your brain ducts

34:12.240 --> 34:16.080
and it's going to take you into a kind of a virtual world.

34:16.080 --> 34:19.600
Your body will still exist here on this plane.

34:19.600 --> 34:24.320
But your brain is often to kind of a creamy matrix like scenario.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.000
It's sort of donut zone.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.480
Yeah, that's what, oh, you've read my thesis.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.320
That's what we actually call it, the donut zone.

34:30.320 --> 34:32.080
And once you're in the donut zone, Gervin,

34:32.080 --> 34:36.800
it all kinds of melts away into a creamy world of pleasure.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.200
I wanted to mention the Mountain Dew Cookbook,

34:39.200 --> 34:41.360
which feels like Munch Squad bait to an extent

34:41.360 --> 34:43.280
that I'm not going to luxuriate in it.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.880
They're paying tribute to the world's greatest fans

34:46.880 --> 34:49.520
with the release of its first ever cookbook.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.840
Just in time for the brand's 80th birthday.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.240
With nearly 40 dishes to satisfy every craving,

34:54.240 --> 34:56.960
provided presumably that that craving involves

34:56.960 --> 34:59.600
consuming Mountain Dew,

34:59.600 --> 35:02.160
the Big Bold Book of Mountain Dew recipes

35:02.160 --> 35:04.640
is a compilation of fan-made, fan-inspired,

35:04.640 --> 35:07.280
and fan-favorited creations from some of the most imaginative

35:07.280 --> 35:09.040
culinary minds on the planet.

35:09.040 --> 35:12.720
Ranging from the quick and easy two-ingredient cupcake treats

35:12.720 --> 35:14.960
to the advanced- Wait, really?

35:14.960 --> 35:20.720
What could you possibly add to Mountain Dew

35:20.720 --> 35:22.720
to make cupcakes come out of them?

35:22.720 --> 35:24.880
Is it like flour and dew?

35:25.600 --> 35:27.280
No, it would be cake mix,

35:27.280 --> 35:32.960
because you can do 12 ounces of soda plus any box cake mix

35:32.960 --> 35:34.960
and make a cake, like a 7-Up cake.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.040
How complicated does it go, Justin?

35:37.040 --> 35:39.840
Well, there's an advanced code red brisket

35:39.840 --> 35:42.480
that will entice any BBQ pit master.

35:42.480 --> 35:48.800
I wanna say this, if the code red brisket is advanced,

35:48.800 --> 35:51.120
that means there is a possibility

35:51.120 --> 35:54.080
for a failed code red brisket

35:54.080 --> 35:57.440
that I don't think it should be legal to consume.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.280
I don't think it's fair to say like,

36:00.400 --> 36:01.600
I'm not sure you did this right.

36:01.600 --> 36:03.280
It's a very advanced recipe.

36:03.280 --> 36:07.280
This is a bad version of the Mountain Dew code red brisket.

36:07.280 --> 36:12.640
The real problem is, is if you enter a catastrophic failed state

36:12.640 --> 36:14.400
on the code red brisket,

36:14.400 --> 36:16.400
there's no way of letting anyone know

36:17.040 --> 36:18.640
in a clearly communicable way.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.600
Same if you succeed wildly.

36:21.600 --> 36:25.120
There's a code red brisket, fucking call the fire department.

36:25.120 --> 36:26.640
No, that's a good thing.

36:26.640 --> 36:27.600
It's got bold flavors.

36:29.680 --> 36:30.960
Look at this crust.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.640
I love that the cookbook had to specify

36:32.640 --> 36:34.800
this as the big, bold Mountain Dew cookbook,

36:34.800 --> 36:38.960
the sequel to the big, tasteful, reserved,

36:39.520 --> 36:41.440
restrained Mountain Dew cookbook.

36:41.440 --> 36:44.800
This ain't your grandma's Mountain Dew cookbook.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.320
It's got six chapters.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.920
I'm gonna give a quick rundown.

36:47.920 --> 36:53.600
Badass breakfast, except the S's and the S are dollar signs.

36:53.600 --> 36:54.640
Even better.

36:54.640 --> 36:55.120
Cowards.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.720
Dew lovers can whip up fluffy green short stacks

36:58.720 --> 37:00.640
and iconic green eggs and ham

37:00.640 --> 37:01.920
that are worth getting out of bed with.

37:01.920 --> 37:02.420
Ew!

37:03.040 --> 37:04.480
What do I get out of bed for?

37:04.480 --> 37:06.880
Fucking green eggs and ham made with Mountain Dew.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.400
Yeah, my life's not going so good.

37:09.760 --> 37:10.960
It's a fair criticism.

37:10.960 --> 37:11.520
Thank you, dad.

37:12.160 --> 37:12.960
Dippin' with Dew.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.640
I actually don't think it's legal to consume Mountain Dew

37:16.640 --> 37:17.360
unless you're dippin'.

37:21.360 --> 37:23.520
As somebody who used to clean up movie theaters

37:23.520 --> 37:25.680
after movie showings in Huntington, West Virginia,

37:25.680 --> 37:29.360
I can pretty much confirm those two are not strange bedfellows.

37:30.560 --> 37:31.840
Dew does dinner?

37:31.840 --> 37:34.960
Seriously, epic entrees like Mountain Dew code red brisket

37:34.960 --> 37:37.920
and Mountain Dew live wire brined turkey.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.120
Oh, boy.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.240
Wow, yeah.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.200
Oh, boy.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.240
Calling for seconds.

37:43.200 --> 37:46.880
These are not cheap cuts of meat you're ruining here, Mountain Dew.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.320
I'll have you calling for seconds

37:48.320 --> 37:52.720
and probably calling your ex-spouse to ask her,

37:52.720 --> 37:54.640
will we're wrong and will she take you back?

37:54.640 --> 37:56.400
And when you can see the kids again,

37:56.400 --> 37:58.720
I'm learning to cook, Debbie, don't you see?

37:58.720 --> 38:00.480
I'm trying, goddammit.

38:00.480 --> 38:05.760
It's satisfying sides with snacks like jalapeno poppers

38:05.760 --> 38:08.000
and Mountain Dew infused pickles.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.120
Now you'll never have to choose between your go-to party sides

38:11.120 --> 38:13.520
and a count of Mountain Dew ever again.

38:13.520 --> 38:14.240
I wasn't.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.360
What world do you think I was in

38:17.360 --> 38:20.880
in which I had to decide between either a jalapeno bubber

38:20.880 --> 38:22.400
or a drink of Mountain Dew?

38:22.960 --> 38:24.960
What is this scenario you presented?

38:24.960 --> 38:28.000
You're counting your calories, but it's Super Bowl Day.

38:29.200 --> 38:29.680
You're right.

38:29.680 --> 38:30.320
Right.

38:30.320 --> 38:35.120
This is, it says that this will be out the week of November 16th,

38:35.120 --> 38:36.480
which is where we are now.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.640
In time, yes.

38:38.640 --> 38:43.920
It is not available on the store currently.

38:43.920 --> 38:47.200
So another lie from a QSR press release.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.080
It's a classic QSR calling their bluff.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.680
Like, okay, I'll engage with this.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.520
Oh, no, no, no, you weren't supposed to come in here.

38:53.520 --> 38:55.040
No, no, no, it's not real.

38:55.040 --> 38:55.680
It's just a thing.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.920
Tony Luck didn't really make a burrito.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.960
I want to share this t-shirt that I found with you guys.

39:02.320 --> 39:05.280
And Griff, if you would mind describing the image

39:05.280 --> 39:09.200
that you've just been sent, I would love that.

39:09.200 --> 39:09.680
Sure, yes.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.960
What do you think I will claim?

39:10.960 --> 39:12.000
It's on Slack.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.320
So this is actually something that I'm going to buy immediately

39:16.320 --> 39:19.280
and wear it until the pits fall out.

39:20.320 --> 39:21.920
I'm buying it right now.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.920
This is a white and sort of-

39:23.920 --> 39:26.640
Hey, can you go and get me one of those in a large, please?

39:26.640 --> 39:30.000
Yeah, go ahead and grab a large for this guy, too.

39:31.040 --> 39:33.120
I'm not going to also ship it to you.

39:33.120 --> 39:33.920
It's a fair point.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.680
No, Christmas is coming up.

39:35.680 --> 39:36.720
Oh, Christmas is coming.

39:36.720 --> 39:37.600
That's a good point.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.600
So this is a white and sort of-

39:40.560 --> 39:41.840
What did you say, medium, Trav?

39:41.840 --> 39:42.640
Large, please.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.400
Large, large here, too, yeah.

39:44.400 --> 39:44.720
Okay.

39:44.720 --> 39:49.280
This is sort of a neon green and white tie-dye design.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.400
They don't have them in kid's size.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.880
With big, bold, black text on it.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.280
All uppercase letters that reads-

39:55.280 --> 39:57.040
Is that going to feel left out?

39:57.040 --> 39:57.600
No, it's fine.

39:57.600 --> 39:57.680
No.

39:59.360 --> 40:00.800
He will if we all wear them at the same time,

40:00.800 --> 40:02.160
which I assume we will.

40:02.160 --> 40:02.800
Oh, yeah.

40:02.800 --> 40:03.520
It says in big, bold-

40:03.520 --> 40:04.880
For photos and stuff.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.480
Big, bold marquee letters.

40:06.480 --> 40:09.280
Make MTN Mountain Dew.

40:09.280 --> 40:12.240
Make Mountain Dew Baja Blast available in stores all the time.

40:16.160 --> 40:16.720
They have it-

40:19.680 --> 40:20.800
I'm going to pass out.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.440
They have the Mountain Dew logo right on the sleeve, too,

40:23.440 --> 40:26.640
to let people know that this is an officially licensed product.

40:26.640 --> 40:29.280
But that is strong.

40:29.840 --> 40:34.480
It is Mountain Dew lobbying Mountain Dew

40:35.840 --> 40:37.520
to make their product available.

40:39.040 --> 40:42.160
Their Mountain Dew Baja Blast available in stores all the time.

40:42.160 --> 40:44.480
The call is coming from inside the house.

40:44.480 --> 40:44.800
Right.

40:44.800 --> 40:45.680
Or inside the mountain.

40:46.720 --> 40:53.200
This is like when Roswell fan sent in hot sauce to save Roswell,

40:53.200 --> 40:56.640
but it's like if Roswell sent hot sauce out to people

40:56.640 --> 40:57.840
to send right back to them

40:57.840 --> 41:00.000
to prove that they really wanted to keep watching Roswell.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.760
And made the fans pay for the hot sauce.

41:01.760 --> 41:05.840
And made the fans pay for $35 for the hot sauce.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.920
That's a lot for a t-shirt Baja Blast.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.280
Are you sure?

41:09.280 --> 41:09.600
Okay.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.360
You know something?

41:11.360 --> 41:13.440
I haven't drank Mountain Dew,

41:13.440 --> 41:15.920
let alone Mountain Dew Baja Blast in many moons.

41:15.920 --> 41:18.720
But if I was at the store and saw Mountain Dew Baja Blast

41:18.720 --> 41:21.280
on the store shelves, I would take a little journey.

41:21.280 --> 41:24.160
I would take a little trip back into my own psyche

41:24.160 --> 41:26.320
just to see where I go.

41:26.960 --> 41:29.040
I would just like to say if Mountain Dew,

41:29.040 --> 41:31.280
I don't know if you have Rainer, what you're connected to,

41:31.280 --> 41:34.160
but if you want to release a series of these that's like,

41:34.160 --> 41:37.200
and also JASTA, and maybe some Surge in there,

41:37.760 --> 41:39.840
like bring back Orbitz, like sure.

41:39.840 --> 41:42.080
I don't know that they own all those, but.

41:42.080 --> 41:43.120
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

41:44.000 --> 41:44.480
Sure, I'd love that.

41:44.480 --> 41:47.440
This one was sent in by The Wizard, Ben Cant, who's superlative.

41:47.440 --> 41:50.400
I omitted last week, shamefully.

41:50.400 --> 41:51.920
Thank you, The Wizard, Ben Cant.

41:51.920 --> 41:54.480
It's from Yahoo Answers user, they are anonymous,

41:54.480 --> 41:55.600
so I'm gonna call them.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.400
Jason asks,

42:00.400 --> 42:03.200
what are some ways to force hotel guests

42:03.200 --> 42:04.800
to go to a free breakfast?

42:06.640 --> 42:07.920
I'm assuming this is,

42:07.920 --> 42:11.040
I don't think that like a La Quinta

42:11.040 --> 42:13.280
is particularly concerned about whether or not

42:13.840 --> 42:16.400
every single guest shows up

42:16.400 --> 42:19.680
to the mandatory free continental breakfast.

42:19.680 --> 42:21.920
I assume this is a sort of mom and pop operation,

42:22.880 --> 42:23.520
mom and pop up,

42:24.320 --> 42:27.760
and they really need to get some of these

42:29.360 --> 42:30.640
old biscuits out of here.

42:31.760 --> 42:37.440
And let's take a current pandemic scenario off the table,

42:37.440 --> 42:42.000
because I think that that presents far too many hurdles.

42:42.880 --> 42:44.400
Yeah, like the one big one

42:44.400 --> 42:46.480
where they could go and then die from it.

42:46.480 --> 42:48.080
Right, exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:48.080 --> 42:52.880
So let's say that this is in the before or after times.

42:52.880 --> 42:55.200
The problem is I forget what the first one is,

42:55.200 --> 42:58.080
and I can't even visualize and imagine the second one.

42:58.080 --> 43:00.960
I know, we've been wandering in the desert for a while now.

43:00.960 --> 43:03.680
It's all desert, like it's all desert to me now.

43:03.680 --> 43:05.680
All I can, all I remember is sand.

43:06.560 --> 43:09.600
We used to have like laser dogs that could like bring you,

43:09.600 --> 43:10.560
I think I remember like laser dogs.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.320
I don't even remember that.

43:12.320 --> 43:14.640
Like laser dogs that would bring you an orange.

43:14.640 --> 43:17.120
I think that sounds right,

43:18.960 --> 43:20.480
but if you didn't want to force hotel guests

43:20.480 --> 43:21.280
to have free breakfast,

43:22.960 --> 43:29.200
anytime you walk by like a well-ventilated restaurant

43:29.200 --> 43:30.480
making smoky foods,

43:31.440 --> 43:33.360
it makes you want to go in there and just like,

43:33.360 --> 43:34.160
see what's up.

43:34.160 --> 43:35.680
I'm not like the biggest barbecue fan,

43:35.680 --> 43:37.120
but if I walk by a barbecue joint

43:37.120 --> 43:39.840
that's venting their barbecue, their meat stink,

43:39.840 --> 43:41.920
out into the universe for everyone to enjoy,

43:42.480 --> 43:44.320
I kind of want to poke my head in there and be like,

43:44.320 --> 43:45.520
oh, what you guys got going on?

43:45.520 --> 43:47.280
And they're like super spicy sausage links.

43:47.280 --> 43:48.960
And I'm like, I'll be going then.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.080
I'm glad I found out though.

43:50.640 --> 43:53.120
Is there any way to do this in an environment

43:53.120 --> 43:56.320
where you do control the air conditioning system

43:56.320 --> 43:57.600
and where it goes?

43:57.600 --> 43:58.640
Well, what if-

43:58.640 --> 43:59.280
You know this, right?

43:59.280 --> 44:00.640
Yeah, Disney does do it.

44:00.640 --> 44:02.240
It's called Smellitzers.

44:03.040 --> 44:03.760
It's called what?

44:04.400 --> 44:05.360
Smellitzers.

44:05.920 --> 44:09.040
They blast out the, like we were on Main Street,

44:09.040 --> 44:13.280
they blast out those candy and baked goods scents

44:13.280 --> 44:15.120
to try to lure you into the shops

44:15.120 --> 44:18.720
and to give you just a fond sense.

44:18.720 --> 44:19.440
It's artificial.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.640
They're just blasting, like,

44:23.280 --> 44:24.320
nostalgia scents at you.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.480
But then at nighttime,

44:26.480 --> 44:28.400
when they want to get everybody out of the park,

44:28.400 --> 44:30.800
they blast a bad smell, like Goofy's dick.

44:32.560 --> 44:34.400
Why would you think Goofy's dick smells bad?

44:34.400 --> 44:36.240
At the end of a hot day working at Disney World?

44:36.240 --> 44:36.800
Yeah, that's fair.

44:37.360 --> 44:37.840
That's fair.

44:39.280 --> 44:40.640
The only thing you need

44:40.640 --> 44:42.960
to get people into a continental breakfast

44:42.960 --> 44:44.960
is one of those make-your-own waffle makers.

44:44.960 --> 44:47.200
People go fucking crazy for that.

44:47.200 --> 44:48.320
There is a line.

44:48.320 --> 44:50.800
When I used to travel back in the before times,

44:50.800 --> 44:52.080
if there was one of those babies,

44:52.080 --> 44:54.960
no matter how long it took to make that goddamn waffle,

44:54.960 --> 44:56.720
people would stand there and wait.

44:56.720 --> 45:01.120
They loved pouring that tiny solo cup of batter

45:01.120 --> 45:02.080
into that bad boy.

45:02.080 --> 45:03.040
Oh, timer went off.

45:03.040 --> 45:03.760
Time to flip it.

45:03.760 --> 45:05.440
Oh, gotta use my little plastic fork

45:05.440 --> 45:06.960
to flip that bad boy out of there.

45:06.960 --> 45:08.560
People love that shit.

45:08.560 --> 45:09.760
That is a wild...

45:09.760 --> 45:12.400
I don't want to get fucking Seinfeld on it

45:12.400 --> 45:15.280
because I'm less, like, it's not as wild to me

45:15.280 --> 45:17.680
that there was a make-your-own waffle maker system

45:17.680 --> 45:21.120
as much as it is wild to me that there was a batter gun

45:21.120 --> 45:23.200
that you kind of just put a little cup under

45:23.200 --> 45:26.480
and then let it milked it like a moocow did,

45:26.480 --> 45:29.120
but pancake juice comes out.

45:29.120 --> 45:30.480
It's a terrible system.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.480
It's a terrible system.

45:32.480 --> 45:34.560
Also, biscuits and gravy.

45:34.560 --> 45:37.040
I'll do that any day of the week if I see anything,

45:37.040 --> 45:38.320
even if I'm not hungry.

45:38.320 --> 45:41.120
If there's biscuits and gravy available, I'll take it.

45:41.120 --> 45:44.320
That's a real day-determiner right there.

45:44.320 --> 45:46.720
Yeah, biscuits and gravy first thing in the day.

45:46.720 --> 45:49.520
That's really setting a tone that you won't be shaking.

45:49.520 --> 45:51.280
You're not getting out of there by 11 a.m.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.120
At hotels, since you asked,

45:53.120 --> 45:56.720
get that fucking, like, tureen of oatmeal out of there.

45:56.720 --> 45:58.240
Nobody's touching that shit.

45:58.240 --> 45:59.360
What is that?

45:59.360 --> 46:00.800
Get that out of there.

46:00.800 --> 46:01.600
And you know what?

46:01.600 --> 46:05.280
I also don't want to see any plain Kellogg's Flakes.

46:05.280 --> 46:06.640
Get that shit out of there.

46:06.640 --> 46:07.920
Nobody wants that.

46:07.920 --> 46:09.040
Sorry, what do you think?

46:09.040 --> 46:10.880
What are, sorry, stop it.

46:10.880 --> 46:12.400
What are plain Kellogg's Flakes?

46:12.400 --> 46:13.760
Like, not the Frosted Flakes.

46:13.760 --> 46:16.000
It's just like the Kellogg's Flake.

46:16.000 --> 46:16.720
You know, it's just like Kellogg's.

46:16.720 --> 46:17.760
Oh, this is great.

46:18.480 --> 46:20.240
No, Travis, stop it.

46:20.240 --> 46:21.200
Stop the podcast.

46:21.200 --> 46:22.320
What are Kellogg's Flakes?

46:22.880 --> 46:25.680
They're like, you know, just like the plain cereal flakes

46:25.680 --> 46:28.000
without any, like, sugar on them.

46:28.000 --> 46:28.800
No frosting.

46:28.800 --> 46:31.040
And those are called, tell me one more time again?

46:31.040 --> 46:32.640
I can't remember the exact name,

46:32.640 --> 46:33.600
but you know what I'm talking about.

46:33.600 --> 46:34.400
Kellogg's Flakes.

46:35.680 --> 46:36.560
Are you doing a bit?

46:36.560 --> 46:40.480
No, you know, with the green and red rooster on it.

46:40.480 --> 46:42.800
What are the bee circles called?

46:42.800 --> 46:45.440
The ones that the bee endorses

46:45.440 --> 46:47.280
and makes so sweet with his stick.

46:48.080 --> 46:48.800
And I think they're called-

46:48.800 --> 46:50.160
You know what I'm talking about.

46:50.160 --> 46:52.720
I think they're called bee circles or beos.

46:54.080 --> 46:55.120
Are they beos?

46:55.120 --> 46:55.440
Little beos?

46:55.440 --> 46:57.120
Cornflakes, Cornflakes.

46:57.120 --> 46:58.080
There it is.

46:58.080 --> 46:59.600
Oh, I got them.

46:59.600 --> 47:01.040
Oh, thanks, boys.

47:01.040 --> 47:02.560
We've talked a lot about the carrot.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.000
Let's talk about this.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.360
Let's talk about the stick.

47:05.360 --> 47:07.680
There's lots of ways to entice your guests

47:07.680 --> 47:08.800
to go to your free breakfast.

47:08.800 --> 47:09.760
That's not what the question is.

47:10.320 --> 47:12.640
The question is, how do I force hotel guests to go?

47:12.640 --> 47:13.840
You gotta get them out of their rooms.

47:15.280 --> 47:16.720
Yes, that is, yes.

47:16.720 --> 47:18.800
You vacuum seal that room, you shut off the air.

47:19.360 --> 47:22.960
6 a.m., they're out of there to go get some-

47:22.960 --> 47:25.280
You've sealed it though, so they are dead now.

47:25.280 --> 47:25.760
Damn it.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.040
They're definitely not gonna be.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.160
Justin, do you wanna try?

47:28.160 --> 47:36.480
Um, a trail of Cheerios that they'll eat the first few

47:36.480 --> 47:37.840
and be like, mm, pretty good.

47:37.840 --> 47:41.840
And then they'll be forced to use your logic.

47:41.840 --> 47:44.320
They'll be forced to continue by their hunger

47:44.320 --> 47:45.360
and their taste for Cheerios.

47:45.360 --> 47:49.520
They'll work on a three-year-old who has bad parents.

47:49.520 --> 47:50.320
Work on ET.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.160
Okay, listen, we got the key cards, right?

47:52.160 --> 47:53.680
That open all the doors, they wake up,

47:54.240 --> 47:55.920
there's someone with the breakfast right there.

47:56.720 --> 47:57.760
Key party.

47:57.760 --> 48:00.560
Oh, well, that's not at all what I said.

48:02.560 --> 48:04.320
Have you guys ever stayed at a residence inn

48:04.320 --> 48:06.000
where they advertise the key parties

48:06.000 --> 48:07.600
that they have every weeknight,

48:07.600 --> 48:09.360
like come and mingle with other young singles

48:09.920 --> 48:11.040
at the residence inn?

48:11.040 --> 48:14.400
Can we all agree that a key party with blank key cards

48:14.400 --> 48:17.520
with no discerning identification on them

48:17.520 --> 48:19.920
would be, I don't know, almost fun?

48:19.920 --> 48:22.320
We're gonna run around and see what door we can open now.

48:22.320 --> 48:23.840
It doesn't matter, because you'll get down there

48:23.840 --> 48:26.320
and you'll be anxiously eating breakfast,

48:26.320 --> 48:28.400
and then by the end, you'd be like, I don't even actually

48:28.400 --> 48:29.520
feel like doing it anymore.

48:29.520 --> 48:32.400
Yeah, I ate a lot of biscuits and gravy.

48:32.400 --> 48:33.120
I'm not.

48:34.320 --> 48:36.240
Have you guys ever noticed the experience,

48:36.240 --> 48:41.440
the phenomenon of if you go to a hotel breakfast

48:41.440 --> 48:44.880
where everything is like pre-packaged,

48:44.880 --> 48:46.000
you know what I mean?

48:46.000 --> 48:48.560
Where it's like all pre-wrapped, pre-packaged foods,

48:48.560 --> 48:52.080
like not prepared on site, all sort of pre-made.

48:52.080 --> 48:54.000
You'll see this a lot at like Holiday Inn Express.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.160
Does it just trigger your urge to steal?

48:56.160 --> 48:56.720
Oh yeah.

48:56.720 --> 49:00.080
I see that, I'm like, I'm gonna load every fucking pocket I got.

49:00.080 --> 49:01.920
I don't know what this day is gonna bring,

49:01.920 --> 49:04.720
but I am gonna have a yogurt at the ready for it

49:04.720 --> 49:05.360
whenever it comes.

49:05.360 --> 49:07.520
I'm always surprised that there's not someone standing by there

49:07.520 --> 49:09.840
when I'm just like, oh, I'm gonna get a plate and some coffee,

49:09.840 --> 49:12.720
take it back to my room, like you eat it here or you leave it.

49:12.720 --> 49:15.280
Yeah, that has monetary, if it's pre-packaged,

49:15.280 --> 49:17.440
this has a monetary value.

49:17.440 --> 49:19.920
There's a value to this, you know what I mean?

49:19.920 --> 49:23.200
If I bring a loose scoop of scoops of coffee,

49:23.200 --> 49:25.200
a scoop of scrambled eggs in my hand,

49:25.200 --> 49:26.480
no one's gonna pay me for that.

49:26.480 --> 49:29.680
But as soon as you contain those scrambled eggs in some way,

49:30.560 --> 49:31.440
it has value.

49:31.440 --> 49:32.720
Baggy or satchel.

49:32.720 --> 49:34.160
Sure, okay.

49:34.160 --> 49:36.000
So Nick, you're saying next time I go,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.240
I should bring a tote bag that I can just dump

49:38.240 --> 49:40.880
the batter blaster like right into,

49:40.880 --> 49:42.400
and then that's my batter now,

49:42.400 --> 49:45.440
and I can resell it on the street for dollars.

49:45.440 --> 49:46.640
It's not that, so much as like,

49:48.320 --> 49:50.800
they have like the little pre-packaged containers,

49:50.800 --> 49:55.520
Raisin Bran, you take one, that's perfectly fine.

49:55.520 --> 49:58.400
You take two, no one's gonna bat an eye.

49:58.400 --> 50:02.160
But there is definitely at the other end of the spectrum,

50:02.160 --> 50:03.920
if you just like supermark them,

50:03.920 --> 50:06.880
sweep them right into your backpack and walk away,

50:06.880 --> 50:08.720
they probably will detain you.

50:08.720 --> 50:09.360
So what is that?

50:09.360 --> 50:12.080
There is a number in the middle at which you are no longer-

50:12.720 --> 50:14.720
Welcome at this establishment.

50:14.720 --> 50:16.480
There is a part of me that acknowledges then that

50:16.480 --> 50:19.600
on some level, the people working the counter,

50:19.600 --> 50:22.880
no one answered to, how many yogurts can I take?

50:24.080 --> 50:26.800
They won't tell you, but you'll pass that point,

50:26.800 --> 50:29.440
and they'll be like, hey, you know that's too many.

50:29.440 --> 50:31.200
They've also gotta clean it up.

50:31.200 --> 50:33.200
So for every yogurt you don't take,

50:33.200 --> 50:36.240
that's another yogurt they have to lug back to the fridge.

50:36.240 --> 50:36.880
You know what I mean?

50:36.880 --> 50:39.120
So they'll probably let you take whatever the fuck you please.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.640
I'm just gonna keep taking yogurts.

50:40.640 --> 50:42.000
You tell me when to stop.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.120
You tell me.

50:43.120 --> 50:44.560
Give me a nod or a sign.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.440
Speaking of telling you when to stop, Travis,

50:47.440 --> 50:49.120
I'm gonna tell you to stop podcasting.

50:49.120 --> 50:49.440
Okay.

50:49.440 --> 50:51.040
Because we've reached the end of another episode

50:51.040 --> 50:52.320
of My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

50:53.200 --> 50:54.800
an advice show for the modern era.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.560
Thank you so much for joining us

50:56.560 --> 50:58.240
for another one of these dalliances.

50:58.240 --> 51:00.240
We hope you're doing well.

51:00.240 --> 51:00.960
Yes, that's right.

51:00.960 --> 51:01.600
A dalliance.

51:01.600 --> 51:03.680
Hey, I wanna tell everybody about a couple exciting things.

51:03.680 --> 51:07.120
One, this weekend, like five days from the 16th,

51:07.120 --> 51:08.480
which I assume is when you're listening to this,

51:08.480 --> 51:09.360
but who knows?

51:09.360 --> 51:11.280
9 p.m. Eastern time, we're doing a virtual

51:11.280 --> 51:12.720
My Brother, My Brother, and Me with-

51:12.720 --> 51:13.280
This Saturday.

51:13.280 --> 51:16.320
This Saturday with Sawbones opening 9 p.m. Eastern time.

51:16.320 --> 51:18.640
It's going to be, let's say, weird

51:18.640 --> 51:20.880
and probably very enjoyable.

51:20.880 --> 51:22.720
Tickets are only $10, and you can get them

51:22.720 --> 51:25.280
at live.themacroroid.family.

51:25.280 --> 51:27.200
Also, we have a lot of exciting merch,

51:27.200 --> 51:31.440
including a pin of the month that is a beautiful void fish,

51:31.440 --> 51:33.520
if I do say so myself, from the Adventure Zone.

51:33.520 --> 51:35.280
It benefits the Loveland Foundation,

51:35.280 --> 51:37.520
which is committed to showing up for communities of color

51:37.520 --> 51:40.000
in unique and powerful ways with a particular focus

51:40.000 --> 51:41.600
on black women and girls.

51:41.600 --> 51:44.480
There's also a Steven the Goldfish keychain by Kate May,

51:44.480 --> 51:46.400
a Vaccines Bumper sticker that benefits

51:46.400 --> 51:48.160
the Immunization Action Coalition,

51:48.160 --> 51:50.000
which works to increase immunization rates

51:50.000 --> 51:51.120
and prevent disease.

51:51.120 --> 51:51.600
There's still-

51:51.600 --> 51:52.160
Lots of other stuff.

51:52.160 --> 51:53.200
Yeah, lots of other stuff.
