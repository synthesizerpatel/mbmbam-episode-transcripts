00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.520
Hello and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, the advice show for the modern era.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.040 --> 00:55.120
And I'm the baby new year ghost. Welcome, baby new year.

00:55.120 --> 00:57.360
I'm the ghost of the baby new year, apparently. Oh no.

00:57.360 --> 01:00.320
The new year is already dead. Sometimes.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.920
Long live the new year.

01:01.920 --> 01:06.960
When I try to do, like, an impression, it almost always comes out ghost,

01:06.960 --> 01:11.920
and I think that probably explains, like, a lot of shit about A, me, and B, this podcast.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.560
That's Griffin, he's our baby brother. Hi.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.960
And this is 20 Forward. We made it. Yep.

01:17.600 --> 01:22.480
20 Dirt got pretty, um, tasey there at the end. I was a little worried about whether or not we're

01:22.480 --> 01:26.560
gonna be able to forward that there stream, but we made it, and we didn't lose any supplies.

01:26.560 --> 01:30.880
Nope. I rung in the new year. I don't know what you guys did. I rung in the new year

01:31.520 --> 01:35.920
at a castle in the center of Ohio while I was trying to solve murder mystery clues.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.840
I didn't know that that was, like, a fucking, like, castle-y.

01:41.040 --> 01:47.200
Was there medieval times, like, the actual time, not the restaurant, in Ohio?

01:47.200 --> 01:49.280
Like, were there sieges? Yeah.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.600
It's all in the Book of Mormon, Griffin. I guess.

01:51.600 --> 01:57.680
Yes. Were there dragons and squires and blacksmiths and shit, like, in-

01:57.680 --> 02:01.280
So you're under the impression that dragons were a part of medieval history.

02:01.280 --> 02:05.280
Because I guess I just kind of thought that, like, Ohio missed out on that. I could maybe

02:05.280 --> 02:08.720
see, like, New Hampshire, like- No, it just, it just cycled later. Like,

02:09.600 --> 02:12.800
here in Ohio, our Middle Ages happened about two years ago.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.640
Yeah, because I was there for that shit. Thanks, BK.

02:14.640 --> 02:18.480
Yeah, and then you left, and then it was the Dark Ages for about a year and a half.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.760
Because I left- And we just found medicine. Yeah, you took it with you.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.040
Oh, Trav, way do you guys get to the Renaissance?

02:25.040 --> 02:27.440
Yeah. Gonna be a lot of naked lady pictures.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.320
Nice. Just warning you.

02:28.320 --> 02:28.720
Yummy. Yummy.

02:28.720 --> 02:29.520
Heads up.

02:29.520 --> 02:34.720
I did karaoke for my New Year's Eve, which was fun. They had an old-line sign in the book,

02:36.960 --> 02:41.040
and it was, there was just a lot of cheer. There was a lot of opening of our private booth doors.

02:41.040 --> 02:45.840
Timing that's a nightmare, though, right? You put it in, it pops up at 10 30. Like,

02:45.840 --> 02:49.760
okay, this is gonna seem- Talking about a private booth, it wasn't like a,

02:49.760 --> 02:52.880
it wasn't like a total request live situation. Whoa, look at-

02:52.880 --> 02:56.400
So you were able to do like karaoke and like strip at the same time.

02:56.400 --> 03:00.320
Biggie Smalls over here with his own private booth. Did you get some crystal?

03:00.320 --> 03:01.920
It was like $6 an hour.

03:02.880 --> 03:03.760
Whoa.

03:03.760 --> 03:10.640
It was not, there were no like fondant fountains. It was, it was a $6 an hour karaoke,

03:10.640 --> 03:11.840
Korean karaoke place.

03:11.840 --> 03:18.240
You know the Golden Corral now has three fountains? Chocolate, white chocolate, and caramel.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.160
Really?

03:21.040 --> 03:26.480
Hey, hey, I got a prime rib, but I want to put it in chocolate, but also caramel.

03:26.480 --> 03:31.360
Okay, I want to say I'm actually amazed that there's not more. That there's not also like

03:31.360 --> 03:36.320
a butter fountain, and like a nacho cheese fountain, and like a gravy fountain, and like

03:36.320 --> 03:39.280
a cookie fountain, and like a sprinkles fountain.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.800
There's a gravy hose.

03:40.800 --> 03:41.920
There's a gravy hose.

03:43.840 --> 03:44.880
Step on up.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.160
Then there's the cookie trough.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.560
Yeah, their newest ads are just step on up you fat piece of shit.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.120
Just give in.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.920
Turn it on, shut it down.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.320
How have the first five days of the year been for y'all?

04:00.960 --> 04:06.560
My favorite thing is seeing on Facebook, and it apparently our standards as a society have

04:06.560 --> 04:10.880
become so little to establish whether a year was good or not when it's like woke up and

04:10.880 --> 04:11.920
put on my slippers.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.160
2014 is looking good so far.

04:14.160 --> 04:19.520
I mean I guess like you haven't like nobody's come up and like punched you in the in the

04:19.520 --> 04:22.080
taint like put on my put on my slippers.

04:22.080 --> 04:24.880
They were scorpion free, smooth sailing.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.160
So far so good.

04:27.680 --> 04:31.040
I just hate to be with that person the one day they're like went to get the peanut butter.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.520
We were out of smooth and only had crunchy left.

04:33.520 --> 04:38.080
Fuck 2014, fuck 12 hours in.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.840
It's already the worst year ever.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.360
If it keeps up at this pace.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.280
Let's uh, let's help some people.

04:43.280 --> 04:43.840
I'm ready.

04:44.800 --> 04:45.840
I'm in good shape for it.

04:45.840 --> 04:46.880
20 forward.

04:46.880 --> 04:47.200
Here we go.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.040
First question of 20 forward is this.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.120
I'm relatively in shape.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.080
Enjoy running.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.600
Well, well, well.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.360
Oh, lardy da.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.400
Lardy da.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.120
Look at me.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.240
I'm fit, damn.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.440
I'm the running man.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.040
I'm the running man.

05:01.040 --> 05:01.680
I love it.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.240
Uh, I typically run an hour a day.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.040
But have found that listening to music just doesn't cut it for me.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.800
I really enjoy singing along.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.880
I found it makes running more fun and singing in general makes me a happier person.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.400
Is this a bad thing to do?

05:16.400 --> 05:17.760
I get embarrassed very little.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.960
And I am not looking for attention here.

05:20.960 --> 05:25.200
But I'm curious if you think it's rude to others to run by them singing skater boy.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.440
That being said, I think it's far more ridiculous to go from full out singing to nothing as soon

05:29.440 --> 05:31.760
as I see someone as it looks like I'm embarrassed.

05:31.760 --> 05:32.800
It's a very Doppler effect.

05:32.800 --> 05:38.240
Just, ah, ah, he's just a skater boy.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.280
See you later, boy.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.040
Outside running only.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.160
Sing as one would sing in the shower or car.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.000
And I try to censor myself.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.320
Are there a lot of swears in skater boy?

05:50.320 --> 05:52.080
He's a fucking skater boy.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.320
I love you skater dick.

05:54.960 --> 05:55.200
What?

05:57.440 --> 05:58.400
Ladies.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.760
What is a skater dick?

05:59.760 --> 06:00.960
From piping in pizza.

06:00.960 --> 06:05.120
It's like a regular dick, but he has one of those little finger flip skateboards that

06:05.120 --> 06:06.720
they sold at Toys R Us for a while.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.160
And a tiny helmet.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.800
He only wears Vans condoms on it.

06:11.920 --> 06:12.720
Hey, do you want to have sex?

06:12.720 --> 06:13.040
I can't.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.240
My dick's a warp tour.

06:14.240 --> 06:14.720
Shit.

06:14.720 --> 06:15.040
Again.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.800
I bet this crazy, this crazy cool lunge lady.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.840
She's totally rad.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.600
Lineup sucks this year, but he'll have fun.

06:21.600 --> 06:22.880
It's more about like the experience.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.600
There's a really easy solution to this.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.840
If you're going to say don't sing, like.

06:27.840 --> 06:28.320
No, no, no.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.680
Can you tell a bird to not sing?

06:29.680 --> 06:29.920
No.

06:29.920 --> 06:30.560
God, no.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.120
You have to do Queen's don't stop me now on repeat.

06:33.840 --> 06:34.720
I like that.

06:34.720 --> 06:38.560
And then make eye contact with everyone you pass and like kind of maybe do like finger

06:38.560 --> 06:38.880
points.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.520
And then they're like, am I stuck in a music video?

06:41.520 --> 06:42.560
And I didn't know it.

06:42.560 --> 06:47.680
And then they'll think, well, I don't, if he, am I stopping him now?

06:47.680 --> 06:49.920
I really don't want to be, he's been very clear about that.

06:49.920 --> 06:50.480
I'm sorry.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.560
I don't want to salt your running game.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.040
Come back.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.200
But then the twist there is by calling out after him, they stop and they're like, what?

06:57.200 --> 06:58.560
And like, oh shit, I stopped him now.

06:59.120 --> 06:59.440
Fuck.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.240
Also, I imagine you have headphones on.

07:02.960 --> 07:07.920
I hope you're not just like fucking carrying, carrying like a boom slammer.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.120
What are those things called?

07:09.120 --> 07:09.760
Boom slammer.

07:09.760 --> 07:10.800
Boom slammer.

07:10.800 --> 07:11.200
Yeah.

07:11.200 --> 07:14.160
Carrying a boom slammer with you as you run.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.680
It's like a jail for your booms.

07:15.680 --> 07:19.040
It's a, it's a boom slammer that you have like strapped to your arm with one of those

07:19.040 --> 07:20.160
little iPod arm bands.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.560
And you're just like, you just like bringing your tunes with you that way.

07:24.560 --> 07:30.000
Cause nobody sounds as good as they think they do singing while they're wearing.

07:30.560 --> 07:31.840
Well, I mean, I earbuds.

07:32.960 --> 07:42.240
Hey, big ups to you, uh, uh, for being able to both run and have the extra lung capacity

07:42.240 --> 07:44.560
to, to like.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.000
Here's the skater boy.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.600
He says see you later boy.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.120
And it's been good enough for her.

07:49.120 --> 07:49.520
Oh God.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.400
What an amateur move.

07:50.400 --> 07:56.160
If God, I got to tell you from an outside observers perspective, like it wouldn't be

07:56.160 --> 07:59.680
a situation of like, if somebody was running towards me in the streets, like shrieking

07:59.680 --> 08:02.880
Avril Lavigne, it wouldn't be a situation of, Oh, that person's so weird.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.720
It would be like, I'm, I am genuinely feared, fearful for my life right now.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.760
I genuinely, I need to be in a different place in this place right now.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.360
That's across the street situation.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.120
Like that would make my day.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.000
Are you kidding me?

08:14.000 --> 08:18.960
Think you said that Justin, you're saying that in like, in to like goof, actually think

08:18.960 --> 08:23.920
about a person running towards you, singing a song while they're running towards you as

08:23.920 --> 08:25.040
fast as they can for fitness.

08:25.760 --> 08:26.160
Okay.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.760
Why am I, why am I at the track?

08:27.760 --> 08:29.040
That's the first thing I got to know.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.080
Are they, are they at the track?

08:30.960 --> 08:32.480
Well, you're at the running track, right?

08:32.480 --> 08:33.600
No, no, no, no.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.880
See, sometimes people just like run on the street where people like walk to go to the

08:36.880 --> 08:37.120
store.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.640
Are there dogs chasing them?

08:38.640 --> 08:41.760
You were walking to H-E-B to pick up a flick at the red box.

08:41.760 --> 08:46.400
And then all of a sudden, somebody's fucking running down, down Guadalupe at you on the

08:46.400 --> 08:48.240
same side of the street, singing a song.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.360
I think that's very rude.

08:49.360 --> 08:53.760
When people jog past my house, I feel like they're having a parade for themselves.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.000
Like, yes, okay, you're running.

08:56.000 --> 08:56.880
Everyone sees you.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.960
Oh, what if you just join a parade?

09:00.560 --> 09:06.640
Oh, oh, you could mask your, uh, you could just stick to only like running with things

09:06.640 --> 09:07.520
that make noise.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.760
Like run next to an ice cream truck.

09:09.760 --> 09:10.640
That would look good.

09:11.680 --> 09:17.440
I think Travis is suggesting what if there were events or circumstances like a parade,

09:17.440 --> 09:21.200
but instead of like floats and stuff, it was just like a bunch of people running like a

09:21.200 --> 09:22.320
long distance.

09:22.320 --> 09:25.040
What if like we could, what if like we invented that?

09:25.680 --> 09:29.520
Like a bunch of people all running down the street and it would like, here's the thing

09:29.520 --> 09:29.680
though.

09:29.680 --> 09:30.640
Here's the best part about it.

09:30.640 --> 09:35.520
It would block traffic for normal people and it would be like pretty annoying in big

09:35.520 --> 09:36.400
cities.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.240
Now Griffin, I feel like you're doing a marathon goof, but what if you did that?

09:40.240 --> 09:42.560
But the whole marathon was like a giant choir.

09:43.520 --> 09:44.800
It was a big sing along.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.120
Well, actually, I was just actually picturing my head.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.800
Can you imagine doing a 5k?

09:48.800 --> 09:50.400
Well, no, but I can't.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.360
Can you imagine doing a 5k?

09:53.360 --> 09:59.440
But like as soon as it starts, there's a guy just like, islands in the stream and that

09:59.440 --> 10:00.720
is what we are.

10:00.720 --> 10:04.160
And then there's also a woman jogging next to him, harmonizing.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.640
That would help me set my pace ahead of those people.

10:11.520 --> 10:12.640
Just got to keep ahead of them.

10:12.640 --> 10:16.320
Um, cause you can't afford to have douche shells in a long run.

10:16.320 --> 10:17.440
You got to stay hydrated.

10:18.400 --> 10:23.840
See, I would suggest maybe like, if like you are instinctively singing along with the song,

10:23.840 --> 10:29.200
listen to some like non non lyrical shit, but then like there's nothing stopping you

10:29.200 --> 10:32.400
from like when you're listening to like, I don't know, let me think of a non lyrical

10:32.400 --> 10:33.360
song real quick.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.400
The Seinfeld theme song just running down the street.

10:36.400 --> 10:44.240
Like I would say that what I love about this question is that they're not worried about

10:44.240 --> 10:45.280
looking weird.

10:45.280 --> 10:51.040
They're worried about seeming rude, which I think is so considerate that you're missing.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.400
I don't think it's rude at all.

10:53.120 --> 10:56.560
I don't think anyone's going to see you running past and go, how rude?

10:56.560 --> 10:59.200
I think they're going to go, I need to get inside.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.840
I need to get somewhere safe behind a threshold.

11:01.840 --> 11:07.840
This is the, well, this is the thing though about, I think there's a law of like, if you

11:09.200 --> 11:14.720
there's momentum impacts the, your, your value of a crazy person.

11:14.720 --> 11:15.040
Right?

11:15.040 --> 11:19.760
So if you are, how often do you run into that situation?

11:20.640 --> 11:25.440
Are you saying like, well, you get into an elevator and it's like, Oh, what are we stuck

11:25.440 --> 11:26.000
in here for?

11:26.000 --> 11:32.880
And then it turns out the person's, you know, talking to a corn dog or something happened.

11:32.880 --> 11:36.560
Or maybe you're just trying to use the bathroom with Cracker Barrel and a weird guy comes

11:36.560 --> 11:40.240
up and shows you his nipple through the crack in the door.

11:40.240 --> 11:41.520
Maybe that happened to you once.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.840
I guess I'm just like uncomfortable with the crazy terminology.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.040
I prefer maybe eccentrics.

11:45.840 --> 11:46.080
Yeah.

11:46.080 --> 11:46.400
Okay.

11:46.960 --> 11:51.360
He was an eccentric, an eccentric gentleman who showed you his eccentric nipple.

11:51.360 --> 11:55.600
Was the nipple eccentric or was it pretty like cut and dry?

11:56.400 --> 11:58.800
Had he drawn a little winking smiley face on it?

11:58.800 --> 12:01.360
No, it's just a regular nipple and it was super upsetting.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.720
I actually want to talk about anything else.

12:02.720 --> 12:02.960
Okay.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.040
Here's another question.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.840
Recently I had my vehicle stolen, which really bummed me out.

12:07.840 --> 12:12.400
I was wondering if you guys had any advice on things to do for a good cheer up session.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.080
And that's from Canadian Couldn't Car.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.120
Get justice.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.960
Like hunt the person down and get justice.

12:16.960 --> 12:20.640
For every car stolen from you, you must steal 10 other cars.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.400
Well, no, that's opposite of justice.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.680
Well, then it balances out.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.440
You got to pay it forward.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.440
I never saw the movie, but I understand that.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.600
What do you say if the three of us need to sit our asses,

12:29.600 --> 12:32.320
sit our fat asses down and watch fucking pay it forward

12:32.320 --> 12:34.880
so we can like reference this film in a way that makes sense.

12:35.680 --> 12:35.920
Yeah.

12:35.920 --> 12:41.520
Once you've, if something is stolen from you, the only like reasonable response is to try to

12:41.520 --> 12:47.840
fill the hours that that thing would have filled for you with justice.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.040
Like trying to pursue justice.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.560
That's how Batman, Bruce Wayne became Batman is because once his parents were dead,

12:52.560 --> 12:54.560
you know that fool wasn't going to go to school anymore.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.160
He's going to make him nobody.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.400
So he decided to just stay home, become Batman.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.400
He had a lot of free time on Batman.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.680
If like he was the world's greatest detective and crime fighter

13:03.680 --> 13:06.000
and also illiterate and couldn't do his timetable.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.520
Completely illiterate.

13:08.880 --> 13:12.400
Batman, to solve my latest riddle, you have to write in cursive.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.800
Wait, no, no, absolutely not.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.920
Can I help you there?

13:15.920 --> 13:19.040
Hey Alfred, could you come here and sign this check for me?

13:19.040 --> 13:19.440
Thank you.

13:20.240 --> 13:20.560
Please.

13:21.360 --> 13:24.080
In for a billion dollars for cancer research.

13:24.080 --> 13:29.920
I wrote Batman, I wrote Batman, but the N, I did it in big block letters and it ends backwards.

13:29.920 --> 13:33.120
I don't think they'll take that because my bank account's not under Batman.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.080
Alfred, what's three times two?

13:40.160 --> 13:41.440
Quit laughing, you old fuck.

13:42.240 --> 13:42.800
Stop it.

13:42.800 --> 13:48.880
It'd be really frustrating for the Joker because all the jokes would go over his head.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.200
They've all got like historical punchlines.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.120
You'll be fiddling like Nero when what are you saying?

13:57.120 --> 13:58.240
I don't follow.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.320
Mad Hatter.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.920
Yeah, like what's a Mad Hatter?

14:01.920 --> 14:02.640
You know, from the book.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.160
About punching some more.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.200
I know about punching.

14:05.920 --> 14:10.720
And the villain he's most impressed by is Clock King because he can tell time.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.560
Like, wow, that is something.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.720
You're not using digital or anything.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.040
I'm super intimidated by you, Clock King.

14:21.200 --> 14:25.360
But on the real side, I just go buy a bunch of stuff on Amazon.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.240
Usually does it for me.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.520
He's got to save money for a car though, he can't buy anything.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.040
No, you don't really need a car.

14:31.840 --> 14:36.000
You could go just test drive cars all day and then not buy one.

14:36.800 --> 14:37.440
Well, that's-

14:37.440 --> 14:39.120
Just to kind of get your fix.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.680
I mean, because like if you're really like jonesing for a car ride.

14:42.640 --> 14:46.160
Oh, could you live next door to an auto dealership and use that to get around town?

14:47.040 --> 14:49.840
Hey, I will have this back to you, my man, but I gotta hit up Go-Mart.

14:52.160 --> 14:55.520
But there's no situation more stressful than test driving a car.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.520
So I don't think that would be like, especially, I don't think that would-

14:57.520 --> 15:02.160
Okay, so maybe like smoke a little weed first just to even it out.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.080
And then go test drive a couple cars.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.600
It's fresh with a little hashish.

15:05.600 --> 15:12.400
I was shocked when they, when I test drove, we bought a car like six months or so ago.

15:12.400 --> 15:16.080
I was shocked that they just let us drive it.

15:16.080 --> 15:23.200
Like I've been driving for 15 years, but suddenly I was terrified about my ability

15:23.200 --> 15:24.800
to operate a motor vehicle.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.240
I had forgotten everything.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.640
That happened when Teresa and I bought the Matrix and I-

15:30.080 --> 15:30.720
Great, great.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.360
I don't think that-

15:31.360 --> 15:33.920
I know you hesitated like for a second, like, I don't know.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.320
I don't think that franchise has a lot of legs on it still.

15:36.320 --> 15:36.720
I don't think it's a great-

15:36.720 --> 15:39.280
Giannis burned me before, I just don't know.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.720
I was so indecisive.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.320
I love Laurence Fishburne though, shit.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.560
Everybody's talking about this.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.760
Who's this Carrie Ann Moss?

15:45.760 --> 15:46.560
I don't know her.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.720
That might be an adventure, fun acting adventure.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.920
I always love finding new actresses I love.

15:51.920 --> 15:52.960
Ah, let's give it a shot.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.560
It's got guns on the box.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.600
This is great.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.160
Let's get the other two right away, sight unseen.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.120
Ah, fuck.

15:59.680 --> 16:00.180
God.

16:01.360 --> 16:01.860
Shit.

16:01.860 --> 16:04.740
It shouldn't, fuck, should have rotten tomatoes those.

16:04.740 --> 16:06.980
Got me a can Keanu, fuck.

16:06.980 --> 16:07.860
Yeah, buy the first one.

16:07.860 --> 16:08.660
You'll love the other two.

16:09.460 --> 16:10.420
Won't love the other two.

16:11.460 --> 16:14.420
I shouldn't even like bother finishing the story now, should I?

16:14.420 --> 16:16.580
Nah, it didn't sound like it was going anywhere like great.

16:16.580 --> 16:17.380
You guys want Yahoo?

16:18.340 --> 16:18.840
Yup.

16:19.380 --> 16:20.020
Are you eating something?

16:20.020 --> 16:20.580
You eating some food?

16:23.140 --> 16:23.620
No.

16:23.620 --> 16:26.260
I can hear you quietly guiltily crunching.

16:26.260 --> 16:31.940
I thought you guys would be riffing for a while.

16:31.940 --> 16:34.420
In my defense, I thought that goof had better legs on it.

16:34.420 --> 16:35.940
That's my fault.

16:35.940 --> 16:40.740
Um, this Yahoo was sent in by somebody anonymous.

16:40.740 --> 16:46.580
It was like I got it from like a Yahoo Answers referral service and I assume that like somebody

16:46.580 --> 16:51.460
sent it in through that service and not that like Yahoo has like gotten self-aware.

16:51.460 --> 16:56.180
Um, cause man, if Yahoo knew how much we'd made fun of it.

16:57.380 --> 17:03.940
Anyway, it's asked by Yahoo Answers user Flaundre Scarlett who asks,

17:05.860 --> 17:08.020
why doesn't the penis gain fat?

17:09.140 --> 17:10.020
Good question.

17:10.020 --> 17:11.220
It just hit me suddenly.

17:12.580 --> 17:13.080
That's it.

17:14.660 --> 17:15.860
We gotta eat the right foods.

17:17.220 --> 17:19.780
You're suggesting that there are foods you can eat.

17:19.780 --> 17:24.500
Just so I'm clear that specifically, like, I guess it makes sense cause like you eat

17:24.500 --> 17:28.100
like a big burger and you're like, oh, this is going straight to my hips.

17:28.100 --> 17:32.820
You're saying there's a way that there's like dick smart bombs in food form.

17:33.460 --> 17:34.740
It's where there's originals.

17:36.020 --> 17:36.740
This whole time.

17:37.380 --> 17:41.700
You couldn't have picked a more upsetting.

17:41.700 --> 17:49.140
You picked, you're saying like grandpa's, preternaturally fat dicks.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.140
The fattest dicks.

17:51.140 --> 17:55.380
You're making me think right now of every Werther's commercial I've ever seen

17:56.100 --> 18:02.420
where a kindly silver haired septuagenarian has a little kid on his lap, which is amazing

18:02.420 --> 18:08.260
that he has room for anything on that lap other than his enormous, not enormous.

18:08.260 --> 18:10.820
We should, we should be careful with the vernacular here cause we're not talking

18:10.820 --> 18:17.620
about like a huge, a huge hog in the typical size.

18:17.620 --> 18:20.180
Not impressive anyway, just horrifying.

18:20.180 --> 18:23.060
Like a fleshy Campbell's can just there.

18:23.940 --> 18:24.820
It looks at it.

18:24.820 --> 18:29.540
You look at it, which you don't want to be doing anyway, but you are looking at it

18:29.540 --> 18:33.380
and you think to yourself like, that dick looks out of shape.

18:34.820 --> 18:36.660
That's one flabby wiener.

18:36.660 --> 18:39.460
That's why old people always get offended if you take one of the Werther's

18:39.460 --> 18:41.140
out of their candy dish.

18:41.140 --> 18:43.140
I'm like, why, that's nature's Viagra.

18:43.140 --> 18:43.460
Be careful.

18:43.460 --> 18:48.900
No, it's not nature's Viagra because it doesn't make, I don't want to get like gross

18:48.900 --> 18:53.060
or blues this soon into 24, but it doesn't like get you hard.

18:53.620 --> 18:55.220
It doesn't get you, it doesn't get you swole.

18:55.220 --> 18:57.380
If anything, it gets you softer.

18:57.380 --> 18:59.540
It gets you, it gets you buzzier a bit.

18:59.540 --> 19:02.420
It's a little bit around the middle.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.740
It gets you swole in a bad way.

19:04.740 --> 19:10.660
And then the problem is after that, if you don't keep it up, you end up with stretch marks.

19:10.660 --> 19:11.700
Oh God.

19:12.660 --> 19:14.340
I can't with this.

19:14.340 --> 19:15.620
I can't do this with you.

19:15.620 --> 19:16.180
Okay, let's-

19:16.180 --> 19:20.500
I just mean, if you don't have a constant source of Werther's, it deflates back weird.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.940
Sure, it deflates back weird.

19:21.940 --> 19:27.700
Like Fat Bastard at the end of the Austin Powers movies, where he's got the weird flaps of skin.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.220
Are you like imagining this?

19:30.020 --> 19:31.220
No, this is a scene.

19:31.220 --> 19:36.580
Okay, let's fucking jump as fast as we can away from this topic of A,

19:36.580 --> 19:40.660
visualizing fat dicks and B, making any Austin Powers references.

19:40.660 --> 19:44.900
Justin, that's going to sound like it's your cue to do your thing.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.740
To do both simultaneously.

19:48.500 --> 19:52.820
Why doesn't the penis gain fat?

19:53.940 --> 19:56.340
It just hit me suddenly, Flaundre Scarlett said.

19:56.340 --> 20:01.540
Now, finish your short story.

20:01.540 --> 20:04.900
I think it's because it's all bone.

20:05.700 --> 20:10.180
Now, Justin has been pushing this theory for a long time.

20:10.180 --> 20:15.060
I don't know if Sydney has been a co-conspirator in this, but she should really know-

20:15.060 --> 20:16.660
She's probably my biggest detractor.

20:16.660 --> 20:17.380
Okay, good.

20:17.380 --> 20:19.460
Because like, she's a goddamn doctor.

20:19.460 --> 20:23.540
Like, I think it actually breaks the Hippocratic Oath to suggest that there's a bone that lives

20:23.540 --> 20:29.460
in your penis. Justin's been pushing this theory about penis bone for a long, long time.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.180
Some animals have a penis bone.

20:32.180 --> 20:32.740
That's true.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.180
Humans are one of them.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.980
That part, I have a little bit of a problem.

20:36.980 --> 20:39.380
Justin, do you have any kind of medical science to back that up?

20:40.420 --> 20:41.220
Boners.

20:41.220 --> 20:42.260
Boners, okay.

20:42.260 --> 20:44.340
The word, the word, the word boners.

20:44.340 --> 20:49.620
Of course, that being said, the word chubby has recently taken on an entirely like,

20:50.420 --> 20:52.980
just like, it's not a good word.

20:52.980 --> 20:55.780
Well, like, it was a great word before.

20:55.780 --> 20:58.340
Like, it was the medically accepted word.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.980
Just get your chubby out and let's take a look.

21:02.740 --> 21:04.340
I am a chubby doctor.

21:04.340 --> 21:04.980
No, no.

21:04.980 --> 21:06.180
Not a fad doctor.

21:06.180 --> 21:06.740
A chubby doctor.

21:06.740 --> 21:07.540
You don't understand.

21:07.540 --> 21:08.660
Like a proctologist.

21:08.660 --> 21:09.700
Yeah, yeah, a chubby doctor.

21:12.340 --> 21:13.380
What doesn't it gain?

21:14.980 --> 21:20.420
A penis bone is called a baculum, which is so close to scot bacula that it-

21:20.420 --> 21:22.740
He's actually the only human being with a penis bone.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.580
That makes sense to me a lot.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.020
Do you want me to ask Sydney real quick?

21:26.020 --> 21:26.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:26.340 --> 21:27.060
I'll just ask her.

21:27.060 --> 21:27.620
Okay, hold on.

21:28.900 --> 21:29.780
But I want to hear it.

21:30.740 --> 21:31.540
Hey, Sydney!

21:32.660 --> 21:33.300
Hey, Sid!

21:34.900 --> 21:37.060
Why doesn't the penis gain fat?

21:39.620 --> 21:41.060
Why doesn't the penis get fat?

21:49.060 --> 21:50.100
She says Jesus.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.660
I'll take it.

21:54.340 --> 21:56.660
I'm not sure she's a good doctor anymore.

21:56.660 --> 22:00.180
I really wanted a more thorough explanation than that.

22:00.180 --> 22:00.740
Wait, hold on.

22:01.460 --> 22:05.700
Was it an exasperated Jesus or is she implying that Jesus' power stops?

22:06.500 --> 22:10.580
She's implied that Jesus was the one that makes it so your penis doesn't get fat.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.180
I think she is trying to-

22:12.980 --> 22:14.660
She heard you ask that question and thought,

22:14.660 --> 22:17.220
this is a great topic for a saw bones episode.

22:17.220 --> 22:21.700
And now she's trying to fucking- she is trying to hold on to this podcast comedy

22:21.700 --> 22:23.700
and use it for her own thing.

22:24.980 --> 22:28.260
Justin, your marriage is tearing our brotherhood apart.

22:29.540 --> 22:29.860
Sorry.

22:29.860 --> 22:31.460
We had a good run though, didn't we?

22:31.460 --> 22:33.460
You and your wife or you and your two brothers?

22:33.460 --> 22:34.260
Time to pick.

22:34.260 --> 22:34.660
This is it.

22:34.660 --> 22:35.460
This is when you pick.

22:36.900 --> 22:37.780
I pick Jesus.

22:38.980 --> 22:40.500
Okay, so I got another question for you guys.

22:40.500 --> 22:41.140
You want to hear it?

22:41.140 --> 22:42.100
Yeah, yeah.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.140
Hey, guys!

22:43.140 --> 22:43.860
Quick question.

22:43.860 --> 22:46.420
I've been married for over a decade now.

22:47.140 --> 22:50.260
In the past few years, I've really come out as a geek girl.

22:50.260 --> 22:53.540
For example, I enjoy playing D&D, watching Firefly, debating-

22:53.540 --> 22:55.380
Hey, listen, we know what geeks are, okay?

22:55.940 --> 22:56.340
Covered.

22:56.980 --> 22:57.940
We got that covered.

22:57.940 --> 22:59.940
But my husband doesn't appreciate my geekdom.

22:59.940 --> 23:03.540
It makes fun of me, making me feel immature and less of a woman.

23:03.540 --> 23:06.180
Sure, he does appreciate the occasional Star Trek episode,

23:06.180 --> 23:08.820
but he draws the line and allowing me to attend a con.

23:08.820 --> 23:13.220
My question is, should I just go back to the closet and try to suppress my geek urges?

23:13.220 --> 23:17.300
What can I do to help him realize how lucky he is and let me explore this side of me?

23:17.300 --> 23:18.420
That's from Sexy Geek Girl.

23:19.140 --> 23:28.420
Man, I got to tell you, we have talked about the idea of self-identity based on cultural

23:28.420 --> 23:33.860
consumption and how most of the time that is not the healthiest thing.

23:33.860 --> 23:39.140
Not that we're shaming those proclivities at all because Christ knows we've got them.

23:39.140 --> 23:42.980
Yes. But the terminology, the phrase

23:44.500 --> 23:49.540
allowing me to attend a con gives me the royal skeevers.

23:49.540 --> 23:50.660
You know, here's the thing.

23:50.660 --> 23:57.060
In my opinion, people that make fun of or make people that enjoy things like this feel less

23:57.060 --> 24:03.540
is because they themselves are afraid to allow themselves to wholeheartedly love something that

24:03.540 --> 24:04.100
much.

24:04.100 --> 24:04.580
Yeah.

24:04.580 --> 24:10.100
You know, if you see someone make fun of like someone at a Star Trek convention, I doubt

24:10.100 --> 24:14.660
that it has anything personal to do with that person so much as they're looking at someone

24:14.660 --> 24:17.460
unabashedly loving something and it scares them.

24:18.580 --> 24:23.380
Something that I've had to keep in mind throughout my marriage, which isn't as long as yours,

24:23.380 --> 24:24.020
but it's getting there.

24:26.340 --> 24:32.980
Sydney can appreciate some things that would fall into the realm of geekdom for sure, right?

24:32.980 --> 24:35.620
She watched Battlestar with me. She loves Doctor Who.

24:35.620 --> 24:38.660
But there are some things where I have to be honest with myself.

24:38.660 --> 24:44.900
I have to look at myself and say, Justin, this is a show about Green Arrow getting his feet

24:44.900 --> 24:48.340
underneath him and maybe meeting the Flash at some point.

24:48.340 --> 24:49.940
Like, probably not.

24:49.940 --> 24:52.500
This isn't gonna fly. Probably not.

24:52.500 --> 25:00.660
Probably doesn't need to watch my DVDs of that show, The Wizard, which was about a little

25:00.660 --> 25:05.940
person who invented things and was rich and a genius and a toy maker.

25:05.940 --> 25:07.860
Probably would not get into that with me.

25:08.980 --> 25:10.900
I mean, now I really want to watch that.

25:10.900 --> 25:13.620
Now, if you want to come over and watch The Wizard, you can.

25:14.340 --> 25:20.900
But I'm saying is sometimes you feel like something can't be a part of you unless that

25:20.900 --> 25:22.340
person is sharing it with you.

25:22.340 --> 25:24.580
Like, you love it so much you want them to take part.

25:24.580 --> 25:27.780
That can be a little off-putting for some people because everybody's got their own taste,

25:27.780 --> 25:31.860
their own things that you like, you have common ground with Star Trek.

25:31.860 --> 25:33.380
Maybe that's a place to build from.

25:33.380 --> 25:35.140
You build out from Star Trek.

25:35.140 --> 25:36.740
Hey, you want Star Trek but good?

25:37.300 --> 25:38.580
It's Battlestar Galactica.

25:38.580 --> 25:39.460
Come watch this with me.

25:39.460 --> 25:41.060
You like Battlestar Galactica?

25:41.060 --> 25:42.340
Why don't you tune into the OC?

25:43.700 --> 25:45.140
It's basically the same thing.

25:45.140 --> 25:46.260
It's a real good show.

25:47.220 --> 25:48.580
Seth is a Cylon.

25:48.580 --> 25:49.300
I've ruined it.

25:49.300 --> 25:55.140
Justin and I are thinking about doing a spin-off from a boom-bam called Ock Ock Ock, maybe.

25:55.140 --> 25:57.780
It's just the OC three times.

25:57.780 --> 25:59.380
We just talk about our favorite episodes.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.260
Anyway, let us know in the comments what you think.

26:02.260 --> 26:02.660
Thanks.

26:02.660 --> 26:03.620
Rate and subscribe.

26:05.940 --> 26:07.460
Don't let anyone make you feel bad about anything.

26:07.460 --> 26:13.140
I mean, it's your husband and I'm sure it would be easy to look at this one facet and

26:13.140 --> 26:14.820
for us to judge it, so I'm not going to do that.

26:15.380 --> 26:19.060
But if it's something that's important to you, you should say something to him and be like,

26:19.060 --> 26:23.780
hey, whether you mean to or not, you're making me feel bad about this and that ain't cool.

26:23.780 --> 26:28.900
Am I like, I was willing to give this dude the benefit of the doubt, but like saying,

26:28.900 --> 26:30.420
no, you can't go to the con.

26:30.420 --> 26:32.900
Is he worried that you're not going to come back?

26:32.900 --> 26:38.900
You're going to meet some, I don't know, some Twi'lek there that's just going to swoop

26:38.900 --> 26:39.540
you away?

26:39.540 --> 26:43.220
You know, Griffin, I'm willing to bet that it's something like seeing it as a reflection

26:43.220 --> 26:46.900
of himself in some way of like, oh, no, please don't go to that.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.420
Please, that'd be so embarrassing.

26:48.420 --> 26:48.740
Don't go.

26:48.740 --> 26:49.860
He doesn't have to fucking go.

26:50.420 --> 26:53.300
But that's what I'm saying is I think that's what you say and be like, hey, listen, this

26:53.300 --> 26:57.220
is a partnership and we're in us and everything, but I want to go to this thing.

26:57.220 --> 26:57.940
You don't have to go.

26:57.940 --> 27:01.940
No one there is going to care that I'm there because everyone else there is also there.

27:02.580 --> 27:05.060
So why is that embarrassing in any way?

27:05.060 --> 27:06.500
I mean, it's not embarrassing.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.700
Like, it's not.

27:07.700 --> 27:08.420
But that's what I'm saying.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.140
That's what I'm saying.

27:09.140 --> 27:12.740
Tell that dude, like, there's nothing embarrassing about it because it's not like you're rolling

27:12.740 --> 27:17.380
up to someone's birthday party in your full out, you know, Star Wars regalia.

27:17.380 --> 27:20.340
But if you roll it to Star Wars convention, what does it matter?

27:20.340 --> 27:21.220
I mean, you could do that.

27:21.220 --> 27:26.100
You could put on your ceremonial head tails and just like fucking roll up to roll up to

27:26.100 --> 27:26.820
this birthday party.

27:26.820 --> 27:27.460
Like, sorry, hon.

27:27.460 --> 27:30.900
You didn't like give me a place to like vent this.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.660
I bought these head tails.

27:32.660 --> 27:33.780
I got to wear them somewhere.

27:34.660 --> 27:42.180
I'm sorry, but also mentioned to your husband that the Avengers was the biggest movie that

27:42.180 --> 27:44.580
the year it came out, that J.J.

27:44.580 --> 27:47.940
Abrams makes Star Trek and Star Wars movies now.

27:47.940 --> 27:54.660
Like, if they canceled sports, the battle is over, you know, Geeks inherited the earth.

27:54.660 --> 27:59.700
I really wanted to watch the Packers 49ers game after this, but you're saying that canceled

27:59.700 --> 28:00.420
sports.

28:00.420 --> 28:02.580
You would think they would wait until at least until the end of the season.

28:02.580 --> 28:02.980
I think the Packers...

28:02.980 --> 28:04.100
Due to lack of interest.

28:04.820 --> 28:06.580
See, I don't think that's true because they like...

28:06.580 --> 28:09.540
They said, you know, they said like only like six people are watching.

28:09.540 --> 28:11.620
They turned out everybody got concussions.

28:11.620 --> 28:12.420
They canceled all sports.

28:12.420 --> 28:15.300
So they managed to sell out the Packers game, which isn't like especially surprising because

28:15.300 --> 28:17.380
that fact everybody bought the seats.

28:17.380 --> 28:18.900
Ironically, everyone bought this.

28:18.900 --> 28:20.100
No one's actually going.

28:20.100 --> 28:21.940
Yeah, no one's going like Lambos.

28:21.940 --> 28:23.460
I saw like every single game.

28:23.460 --> 28:24.900
So it's not super surprising.

28:24.900 --> 28:29.140
It is like negative 40 degrees right now in Wisconsin.

28:29.140 --> 28:30.740
People sitting around negative 40 degrees.

28:30.740 --> 28:36.820
I got to get a high, high price ticket to do that to lose to lose my gins in the cold.

28:37.540 --> 28:38.740
The toe comes off in the boot.

28:40.740 --> 28:42.260
God, it's insane.

28:42.260 --> 28:42.900
How do you do that?

28:42.900 --> 28:48.660
It's right now at the Packers game, it's 48 to 39.

28:48.660 --> 28:49.380
Is that the score?

28:49.380 --> 28:49.940
No.

28:49.940 --> 28:52.980
Number of penises that have fallen off versus the number of butts that have fallen off.

28:52.980 --> 28:54.820
They're just frozen off and come off.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.900
But we'll keep you updated throughout the game.

28:56.900 --> 29:00.420
Now let's go back to the Totino's Halftime Show starring John Madden.

29:01.860 --> 29:04.660
Sorry, John Madden and his band, the Madden Knights.

29:07.540 --> 29:11.460
Hey, I'm no better at commentating than I'm at playing bass.

29:11.460 --> 29:12.260
One, two, three.

29:12.260 --> 29:13.220
Let's hit it.

29:13.220 --> 29:14.660
Oh, wait, hold on one second.

29:16.980 --> 29:18.340
There's fucking pizza rolls.

29:19.700 --> 29:23.620
Boom, and he's on his back again, covering himself in pizza rolls.

29:25.140 --> 29:32.580
You know, when I was in middle school, I read the book All Madden by John Madden like five times.

29:32.580 --> 29:35.540
I still have passages of that book that I remember.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.780
You want to know how John Madden treats a sore throat?

29:37.780 --> 29:39.140
Don't even worry about it.

29:39.140 --> 29:41.140
You want to know how strong he thinks LT is?

29:41.140 --> 29:41.700
Very.

29:41.700 --> 29:46.420
I just googled John Madden dead because I was, no kidding, guys,

29:47.460 --> 29:53.140
500% sure that John Earl Madden, born April 10th, 1936, was dead as fuck.

29:54.420 --> 29:58.900
But right now it just says born and this is dead question mark.

29:58.900 --> 29:59.140
Dead?

30:00.020 --> 30:04.260
End of the day, sexy geek girl, don't suppress your urges.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.820
Don't let anyone make you stop doing anything you want to do,

30:06.820 --> 30:08.180
as long as it's not hurting anyone.

30:08.180 --> 30:16.260
But Devil's Advocate, there is absolutely nothing, nothing, nothing wrong with these habits.

30:17.140 --> 30:20.340
But I always say, when we talk about this stuff,

30:20.340 --> 30:25.140
I get super uncomfortable when people define themselves with it.

30:25.140 --> 30:27.620
I mean, the thing is, marriage is a partnership.

30:27.620 --> 30:30.820
Yes, on the one hand, you shouldn't let him make you feel bad about it.

30:30.820 --> 30:34.100
But on the other hand, you're in a partnership with this dude.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.780
So there's got to be some level of,

30:35.780 --> 30:40.420
maybe what he doesn't want to do is decorate the whole living room in a Doctor Who theme.

30:40.420 --> 30:41.540
Right, but I don't think she's-

30:42.180 --> 30:45.060
What I'm saying, but like, so don't go like fucking hog wild.

30:45.060 --> 30:49.060
Find a nice, even keel that the both of you are happy and comfortable with.

30:49.060 --> 30:51.220
But if you want to go to the con, go to the fucking con.

30:51.220 --> 30:52.900
Yeah, go to that con, girl.

30:52.900 --> 30:53.540
Girl, damn.

30:53.540 --> 30:54.180
We'll see you there.

30:54.180 --> 30:54.740
Let's get paid.

30:54.740 --> 31:06.740
Let's get paid.

31:06.740 --> 31:10.740
Guys, I have a pretty fat penis and the rest of me is pretty fat too.

31:10.740 --> 31:16.500
And I decided that in 20 forward, I'm going to move my weight number 20 backward,

31:16.500 --> 31:18.420
by which I mean I'm going to lose 20 pounds.

31:18.420 --> 31:18.900
But I love-

31:18.900 --> 31:19.140
Wow.

31:19.140 --> 31:21.140
The problem is I like eating food that tastes good.

31:22.500 --> 31:24.580
Oh, well, there's no solution.

31:24.580 --> 31:25.080
Damn it.

31:26.740 --> 31:27.380
Excuse me.

31:27.380 --> 31:28.900
Maybe you haven't heard of Nature Box.

31:28.900 --> 31:32.180
Remember earlier when I was eating and it was rude?

31:32.180 --> 31:38.100
Well, I was eating sweet potato fries that I got sent to me from the fine people at Nature Box.

31:38.660 --> 31:40.980
Curbing your appetite doesn't get any easier, guys.

31:41.540 --> 31:47.460
It's going to help you lose weight with these snacks that are shipped in a box to you monthly.

31:47.460 --> 31:49.300
I get like 10 snacks a month.

31:49.300 --> 31:50.340
You get to choose whatever you want.

31:50.340 --> 31:54.580
They have like a crazy assortment of things you wouldn't have even considered having.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.700
But Man Alive, they are delicious.

31:57.700 --> 31:58.100
So like-

31:58.100 --> 31:58.900
And here's the thing.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.180
They got the sweets covered.

32:00.180 --> 32:04.420
They got the French toast, granola, like the salted caramel pretzel pops.

32:04.420 --> 32:06.420
God, I ate so many of those when I was in town.

32:06.980 --> 32:12.340
But they also have like some amazing like salty savory shit because I prefer that.

32:12.340 --> 32:14.020
I like my chips and stuff.

32:14.020 --> 32:15.220
They've got some stuff.

32:15.220 --> 32:16.340
Oh, they have-

32:16.340 --> 32:18.420
Italian bistro pestles are very good.

32:18.420 --> 32:21.300
They have very elusive chili lime pistachios.

32:21.300 --> 32:23.060
One of these days I'll eat those without my-

32:23.060 --> 32:26.500
Without my wife just like hoovering them up, shelling all.

32:27.380 --> 32:30.660
So I guarantee no matter what your tastes are, they've got something that you're just-

32:30.660 --> 32:31.380
And it's all natural.

32:31.380 --> 32:34.740
There's no trans fats, no high fructose corn syrup, nothing artificial.

32:34.740 --> 32:38.500
And the best news is you can try it if you want for half off.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.260
You use coupon code MYBROTHER.

32:40.980 --> 32:44.100
Go to naturebox.com and use the promo code MYBROTHER.

32:44.100 --> 32:44.740
All one word.

32:45.300 --> 32:45.940
All one word.

32:45.940 --> 32:48.100
And you're going to get like 50% off these great snacks.

32:48.100 --> 32:52.020
So like my thing right now that I've been using to lose weight in 20 forward is I-

32:52.020 --> 32:54.820
Every time I get hungry, instead of eating, I smoke a whole cigar.

32:56.260 --> 32:58.820
I've also been dipping all my food in Olestra.

33:00.420 --> 33:03.460
Just because like I remember that that was on those chips for a while.

33:03.460 --> 33:05.540
And those did actually I think help me lose some weight.

33:06.660 --> 33:09.540
So is this a better option or-

33:10.420 --> 33:11.700
No, this is much, much better.

33:11.700 --> 33:12.420
It's all natural.

33:12.420 --> 33:13.540
But I would assume-

33:13.540 --> 33:15.300
Olestra is pretty all natural, I think.

33:15.300 --> 33:17.620
Yeah, but with your frequent bowel movements,

33:17.620 --> 33:20.340
you're going to be missing some highlights from your favorite TV shows.

33:20.900 --> 33:22.980
And I'm sure you're pretty worried about that.

33:22.980 --> 33:24.500
Not really, I just like let it r-

33:24.500 --> 33:25.860
Just like let it leak.

33:25.860 --> 33:28.420
That's my 20 forward, colon, let it leak.

33:28.420 --> 33:29.780
That's the colon, by the way.

33:29.780 --> 33:30.740
Colon, let it leak.

33:30.740 --> 33:34.020
It's not, it is not a punctuation mark.

33:34.020 --> 33:35.460
It's just my, it's my butt.

33:35.460 --> 33:37.220
The good news is there's Hulu Plus.

33:37.220 --> 33:40.100
That's going to help you catch up on all your shows that you missed.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.940
You tried Hulu.com, everybody loves it.

33:41.940 --> 33:42.260
It's great.

33:42.260 --> 33:44.340
They had this great accident with Alex Baldwin for a while.

33:44.340 --> 33:45.700
You probably tried Hulu Minus.

33:46.580 --> 33:49.380
Yeah, that's just like a blank screen for a couple hours.

33:49.940 --> 33:55.300
But now they've got a lot of huge JPEGs of your favorite shows at Hulu Minus.

33:55.300 --> 33:55.940
You don't want that.

33:55.940 --> 33:58.820
It's actually just a guy describing TV shows to you.

33:59.460 --> 34:01.620
You'll never believe what happened on Doctor Who last night.

34:01.620 --> 34:02.740
Is there Hulu colon?

34:04.660 --> 34:08.260
They got SNL, they got Jimmy Kimmel Live, Shark Tank, and Scandal.

34:08.260 --> 34:11.380
And there's like every episode of shows like Lost, Law & Order SVU,

34:11.380 --> 34:14.500
Doctor Who, and Community, and they got some original stuff too.

34:14.500 --> 34:19.780
The Wrong Man's Behind the Mask, which is the show Travis was watching about sports mascots.

34:20.980 --> 34:23.620
And the best of all, it's only eight bucks a month.

34:24.340 --> 34:24.980
No problem.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.820
Eight bucks a month, anybody can spare that.

34:26.820 --> 34:29.300
And, and it always costs eight bucks a month forever, right?

34:29.300 --> 34:30.580
Griffey, you have to pay that right up front.

34:31.220 --> 34:31.860
Yeah, pretty much.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.860
Oh no way, you stupid idiot.

34:33.860 --> 34:35.940
Right now, you can try that Hulu Plus.

34:35.940 --> 34:37.860
You can get on that tip for free for two weeks.

34:38.660 --> 34:39.700

34:45.220 --> 34:47.060

34:47.060 --> 34:50.180
Stop what you're doing right now.

34:50.980 --> 34:52.020
Breaking news.

34:53.060 --> 34:58.660
Twice a month, Chicago comedians Cody Melcher and Ranjit Suri invite a funny friend of theirs

34:58.660 --> 35:02.420
over to talk about a really weird book they've all just read.

35:02.420 --> 35:06.260
Now hold on, do they, do they broadcast these discussions?

35:06.260 --> 35:07.060
Or are we just including everybody in-

35:07.060 --> 35:10.100
No, there is no way to listen to this, but-

35:10.980 --> 35:15.060
No, I would say if you are outside their window on a warm summer's day,

35:15.620 --> 35:16.820
and the breeze is in the-

35:16.820 --> 35:19.060
No, you can, you can listen to this podcast.

35:19.060 --> 35:23.060
They have people like Dan Telfer, our, our dear friend.

35:23.060 --> 35:23.860
I think I can say that.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.700
He introduced us once, Dan Telfer.

35:25.700 --> 35:29.220
SNL's Tim Kasrinsky, Community's Danny Pudi.

35:30.100 --> 35:34.980
They've done so many books from Edgar Allen Poe's only novel to a conspiracy book about

35:34.980 --> 35:37.860
homosexuals starting the Nazi party to Twilight.

35:38.580 --> 35:39.940
It's called Tomfoolery.

35:39.940 --> 35:40.740
Nope, Tom.

35:42.100 --> 35:45.380
There's a clever fucking pun like in the name of it.

35:45.380 --> 35:47.380
Well, just call me Batman, sorry.

35:48.500 --> 35:51.540
Tomfoolery is the actual name of the actual thing.

35:52.820 --> 35:56.340
The newest episode is Children of the Matrix with Aaron Lane.

35:57.380 --> 36:03.540
So go over to Tomfoolery, that's T-O-M-E-F-O-O-L-E-R-Y.com.

36:03.540 --> 36:05.860
And listen to this great show.

36:05.860 --> 36:08.580
And tell them we sent you, and tell them they're welcome.

36:09.460 --> 36:10.900
Well, like, and apologize.

36:12.020 --> 36:13.460
You know, Tom's like a book.

36:14.260 --> 36:17.780
They didn't just like spell Tomfoolery like wicked super wrong.

36:17.780 --> 36:21.220
Tomfoolery.com was taken, and they're like, well, what do we throw in there?

36:21.220 --> 36:23.540
Well, if we throw it in, it's like a book thing.

36:23.540 --> 36:25.140
Anyway, check that out.

36:25.140 --> 36:27.380
They're on Facebook slash Tomfoolery.

36:27.380 --> 36:28.900
They're also on iTunes.

36:28.900 --> 36:29.620
All right, I'm done.

36:29.620 --> 36:30.580
You guys do this next one.

36:30.580 --> 36:30.900
I'm done.

36:30.900 --> 36:31.300
I'm out.

36:31.300 --> 36:31.940
I'm done.

36:31.940 --> 36:35.540
This next one's for Justin from his brothers Travis and Griffin.

36:35.540 --> 36:38.580
Dear Justin, we're sorry for making fun of your illiteracy.

36:38.580 --> 36:39.700
Love your brothers.

36:39.700 --> 36:40.820
It's not illiterate.

36:40.820 --> 36:42.260
He's like Pauline illiterate.

36:42.260 --> 36:49.460
This message is a special message, and it's for Pauline from Brandon, who is the nice boy who

36:49.460 --> 36:50.100
lives with her.

36:50.660 --> 36:52.100
Who hopefully you're aware of.

36:52.100 --> 36:55.860
Hopefully you, oh God, that raccoon's back in the crawl space.

36:55.860 --> 37:04.260
This special message is coming from inside the house, and it says to my favorite partner,

37:04.820 --> 37:07.300
thanks for hanging out with me for almost three years.

37:07.300 --> 37:09.380
If there's a day when you haven't made me laugh, I don't remember it.

37:09.380 --> 37:10.180
Thanks for turning me on.

37:10.180 --> 37:13.460
Bim bam and Merry Christmas or Happy New Year or Happy Valentine's Day,

37:13.460 --> 37:16.020
depending on when the mackerels get around to reading this.

37:16.020 --> 37:16.500
Nice.

37:16.500 --> 37:17.380
Burned.

37:17.380 --> 37:19.060
Yeah, that's painful and accurate.

37:19.060 --> 37:22.580
I will need some salve for the burn you just laid down.

37:22.580 --> 37:23.300
Severe burn.

37:23.300 --> 37:29.460
Brandon, sorry, we said that you're a monster living in Pauline's mirrors that only hops out

37:29.460 --> 37:30.500
when she turns her back.

37:33.540 --> 37:39.060
We are sorry about that, that I just said, and we hope you guys have a great holiday.

37:39.060 --> 37:39.780
Great Hanukkah.

37:39.780 --> 37:40.500
Happy Hanukkah.

37:40.500 --> 37:53.300
Happy Christmaca, you guys.

38:10.500 --> 38:40.340
And one final announcement, Dave Holmes, the great Dave Holmes from television,

38:40.340 --> 38:44.580
is joining the network as the new host of our funny as heck international quiz show,

38:44.580 --> 38:45.860
International Waters.

38:45.860 --> 38:48.180
It's going to be a great year for Maximum Fun.

38:48.180 --> 38:53.940
You can check out all our new shows at MaximumFun.org or wherever you find your podcasts.

38:58.340 --> 38:59.540
Here's another question.

38:59.540 --> 39:00.660
How about a Yahoo?

39:00.660 --> 39:01.940
Any Yahoo's lying around?

39:01.940 --> 39:02.580
Yeah, I got a Yahoo.

39:02.580 --> 39:03.860
This one was sent in by John Williams.

39:03.860 --> 39:04.500
Thanks, John.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.820
It's by Yahoo answer user, Ben, who asks,

39:06.820 --> 39:11.700
What bear is best and why?

39:13.700 --> 39:15.060
God, don't get me started.

39:15.060 --> 39:17.460
What bear is best and why?

39:18.020 --> 39:21.620
It lists black bear, grizzly, and why?

39:21.620 --> 39:22.740
Let's take these one at a time.

39:22.740 --> 39:25.540
Black bear, official animal of West Virginia.

39:25.540 --> 39:25.940
Pretty great.

39:26.500 --> 39:27.380
Pretty hard to beat.

39:27.380 --> 39:28.020
You know what he loves?

39:29.060 --> 39:29.700
What?

39:29.700 --> 39:30.500
He loves berries.

39:31.060 --> 39:33.140
That's not a pun or a play on words.

39:33.140 --> 39:35.380
That motherfucker do love him some berries.

39:35.380 --> 39:36.180
Mm-hmm.

39:36.180 --> 39:36.680
Okay.

39:37.460 --> 39:38.020
Grizzly.

39:39.060 --> 39:40.340
Like Grizzly Adams.

39:40.340 --> 39:41.460
No, I think like the bear.

39:42.100 --> 39:43.380
No, like Grizzly Adams.

39:43.380 --> 39:44.900
I think they're asking about bears, so.

39:45.700 --> 39:48.420
Oh, Grizzly Adams was like a bear of a man.

39:49.700 --> 39:50.740
We're getting into semantics.

39:50.740 --> 39:51.540
I don't think we should.

39:52.500 --> 39:53.300
And why do you think so?

39:53.300 --> 39:55.220
So like this person only listed just the two bears.

39:55.220 --> 39:58.180
I don't know if they want us to decide between black bear and grizzly

39:58.180 --> 39:59.620
because that's a pretty easy one, black bear.

40:01.540 --> 40:03.780
My favorite kind of bear is poo bears.

40:03.780 --> 40:05.620
Oh, Travis.

40:05.620 --> 40:08.980
Because like me, we both enjoy smack rolls of honey.

40:08.980 --> 40:13.060
Travis is trying to take us back to the days of Christopher Robin and poo.

40:13.060 --> 40:16.740
The great thing about black bears.

40:16.740 --> 40:21.380
Got a honey bar stuck in honey's nose.

40:21.380 --> 40:22.260
It's the great thing about.

40:22.260 --> 40:27.780
And from there when there was no one.

40:27.780 --> 40:30.820
Travis is only singing this song because he knows it makes me cry every time.

40:30.820 --> 40:34.980
They did this to me before.

40:34.980 --> 40:35.620
Please don't.

40:35.620 --> 40:36.260
I'm serious.

40:36.260 --> 40:36.660
I'll cry.

40:37.620 --> 40:39.460
They did this to me before Griffin's wedding.

40:42.900 --> 40:44.660
And then everybody thought I was crying about happiness.

40:44.660 --> 40:46.900
All the bees in the hive.

40:46.900 --> 40:49.060
Count the bees.

40:49.060 --> 40:51.620
Chase all the clouds from the sky.

40:51.620 --> 40:54.660
Chase the clouds away.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.420
And now it's no longer fair use.

40:56.420 --> 40:56.660
Hold on.

40:56.660 --> 40:57.940
It's not fair use anymore.

40:57.940 --> 40:59.540
It was fair use up until the bees.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.700
They had a good run.

41:01.700 --> 41:04.980
I think the good thing about black bears versus grizzly bears is that black bear didn't eat

41:04.980 --> 41:05.620
grizzly man.

41:05.620 --> 41:06.180
That's true.

41:06.180 --> 41:09.220
And grizzly bears are going to have a hard time getting that one off their record.

41:09.220 --> 41:10.180
It's right there in the name.

41:11.620 --> 41:12.340
I like the pole.

41:12.340 --> 41:13.380
I like a polar bear.

41:13.940 --> 41:14.500
They're pretty good.

41:14.500 --> 41:17.060
I guess in their hair, their hair is in white.

41:17.060 --> 41:18.260
It's sweet.

41:18.260 --> 41:19.380
Their hair is in white.

41:19.380 --> 41:20.500
It's translucent.

41:20.500 --> 41:23.860
I mean, if we're done with jokes for a bit, I'm a big sun bear fan.

41:23.860 --> 41:26.820
Those guys with their like long, long claws and their little faces.

41:26.820 --> 41:30.660
I also like the Kodiak because it's like 10 feet tall.

41:31.220 --> 41:32.740
That's a pretty horrifying bear.

41:32.740 --> 41:38.980
Is that the bear that was in that movie with, oh god, you know, where they're like on the

41:38.980 --> 41:43.700
river and there's a bear that just like won't leave them the fuck alone and they eat that

41:43.700 --> 41:44.980
dude from Lost.

41:44.980 --> 41:45.620
They don't eat it.

41:45.620 --> 41:46.740
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

41:46.740 --> 41:49.140
Man, this story, guys, is getting away from me.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.820
There's a bear that eats the guy from Lost.

41:52.020 --> 41:53.780
Michael eats Michael from Lost.

41:53.780 --> 41:56.900
And then there's that older guy.

41:56.900 --> 42:00.420
And then I want to say anyway.

42:01.940 --> 42:04.660
Wow, when you said we were done with jokes, you meant for the whole show.

42:05.700 --> 42:08.340
I need to remember the name of either of the actors in The Edge.

42:09.540 --> 42:11.620
It's Hulk Bolin and Anthony Hopkins.

42:11.620 --> 42:13.060
You couldn't fucking help a brother.

42:13.060 --> 42:15.540
You couldn't fucking step in and be like, let me get this for you.

42:16.260 --> 42:18.420
I heard you were doing so well by yourself.

42:18.420 --> 42:22.100
I like a koala bear because it's not a bear and that's gotta be awkward.

42:22.100 --> 42:24.020
It's a Marmaduke.

42:24.020 --> 42:28.900
We can do this for hours and hours and hours and like we'll have a great time doing that.

42:28.900 --> 42:30.420
And like so will the listeners.

42:30.420 --> 42:32.260
I think we need to like come up with some metrics.

42:32.260 --> 42:36.420
I think we need to like boil it down to who would win in a fight.

42:37.460 --> 42:39.700
Okay, so we have to eliminate human bears.

42:39.700 --> 42:41.220
Bear Grylls, Grizzly Adams.

42:41.220 --> 42:42.900
Yeah, because that, sorry, like Bear Grylls.

42:42.900 --> 42:43.700
Kodiak Jack.

42:43.700 --> 42:47.140
Bear Grylls is okay, but Kangaroo Jack.

42:47.140 --> 42:48.420
Kangaroo's the type of bear.

42:48.420 --> 42:53.140
Now would Gentle Ben be eliminated just by the fact that he's so gentle?

42:53.140 --> 42:55.540
He's not going to win in any fights.

42:55.540 --> 42:58.980
Are we looking for a species of bear that is the most dangerous?

42:58.980 --> 43:03.620
Let's sit here and let's each come up with a bear represent- an ursine representative

43:04.660 --> 43:08.180
that we can then see pit against each other.

43:08.180 --> 43:10.180
And we'll like, we'll role play it out.

43:10.180 --> 43:14.900
We'll do a bit of bear role playing and then we'll see who comes out the victor.

43:16.180 --> 43:16.420
Okay.

43:16.420 --> 43:20.260
I know what mine is, like I sort of came prepared.

43:20.900 --> 43:21.780
Okay, what's your bear?

43:22.420 --> 43:25.300
I mean, I don't want to say mine first because then what if you like figure out the strength

43:25.300 --> 43:27.380
level, the power level of my bear?

43:27.380 --> 43:27.780
You quantify.

43:27.780 --> 43:29.780
What if we've already named all the bears?

43:29.780 --> 43:30.820
I've got mine, I've got mine.

43:31.380 --> 43:32.180
Travis has his.

43:33.060 --> 43:34.740
Justin, you need a minute?

43:34.740 --> 43:37.140
Okay, just our species or a specific bear?

43:37.140 --> 43:39.540
A bear, the most powerful bear.

43:40.100 --> 43:42.420
Okay, you guys go first.

43:42.420 --> 43:43.460
Okay, Travis.

43:43.460 --> 43:45.300
Wait, I need to hear your bear.

43:45.300 --> 43:47.380
Now, should we say our bears at the same time?

43:48.020 --> 43:48.500
Yeah.

43:48.500 --> 43:51.300
All right, I'll say, I'll say my bear and then you say yours right after so you don't

43:51.300 --> 43:54.340
have time to like, like change, change.

43:54.340 --> 43:55.140
Okay, you ready?

43:56.180 --> 43:56.900
Ursa Major.

43:58.180 --> 43:59.220
Teddy Ruxpin.

43:59.220 --> 44:06.100
Okay, so Teddy Ruxpin is flung into one of the many stars that compose Ursa Major and

44:06.100 --> 44:10.100
his- Listen, I knew as soon as you said it Griffin, but we specifically said no cheating,

44:10.100 --> 44:11.940
so I wasn't going to deviate from my preset course.

44:11.940 --> 44:15.540
Is it cheating or is it the most powerful bear that there is?

44:15.540 --> 44:16.820
Because it's celestial?

44:16.820 --> 44:21.460
I feel like the rules are pretty clear about what we were looking for.

44:21.460 --> 44:23.060
So what's the best kind of bear?

44:23.060 --> 44:23.860
Star bear.

44:23.860 --> 44:24.580
Yeah, star bear.

44:24.580 --> 44:25.220
Can't really beat that.

44:25.220 --> 44:26.580
Star bear is the best.

44:26.580 --> 44:30.500
Justin, I guess you have a pretty good opportunity here to think of what beats a bunch of stars.

44:31.140 --> 44:32.180
It's one star.

44:32.180 --> 44:33.140
It's one star.

44:33.140 --> 44:34.660
Ursa Major is one star.

44:34.660 --> 44:36.180
I think it's a bunch of stars.

44:36.180 --> 44:37.940
No, it's one, it's the north star.

44:37.940 --> 44:39.300
It's not the north star.

44:39.300 --> 44:40.420
Hachi machi.

44:40.420 --> 44:42.580
I'm almost certain it's the north star.

44:42.580 --> 44:44.420
It is most certainly not.

44:44.420 --> 44:46.020
It's in all the ancient texts.

44:47.860 --> 44:51.300
Let me get out my astrolabe and prove both you fucks wrong.

44:51.300 --> 44:53.940
Oh yeah, guys, I'm looking at my lab right now.

44:53.940 --> 44:54.980
It's a bunch of stars.

44:55.540 --> 44:56.260
It's a bunch of stars.

44:56.260 --> 44:58.420
It's like six to eight stars.

44:59.380 --> 45:00.740
Okay, I have something I have to beat.

45:00.740 --> 45:01.780
Depending on the season.

45:02.660 --> 45:04.260
I have something that can beat your bear.

45:04.260 --> 45:09.380
My bear is one to eight stars, so let's see what you got, hotshot.

45:09.380 --> 45:10.100
All right.

45:10.100 --> 45:13.940
How about the brightest star in the Hanna-Barbera galaxy?

45:13.940 --> 45:14.900
Mr. Yogi Bear.

45:16.180 --> 45:17.060
Hey boo boo.

45:17.060 --> 45:19.780
That one isn't even like, especially outside the box.

45:19.780 --> 45:20.820
Hey boo boo boy.

45:20.820 --> 45:22.900
I certainly like picnic baskets.

45:22.900 --> 45:25.700
Here's the thing about Yogi Bear that you didn't think about.

45:25.700 --> 45:27.460
He eats stars for power.

45:28.180 --> 45:30.260
He is galactus.

45:30.980 --> 45:33.460
He is Yogi Bear system killer.

45:33.460 --> 45:35.300
Yogi Bear star eater.

45:35.300 --> 45:40.740
He is something that you don't know about Yogi Bear is that he's 56 years old.

45:40.740 --> 45:45.220
No bear has ever been that old, so we have to assume that Yogi Bear is immortal.

45:45.220 --> 45:45.700
Okay.

45:45.700 --> 45:51.540
So from that, like if you were to extend that out, then even stars burn out.

45:51.540 --> 45:54.580
But Yogi Bear's presence.

45:54.580 --> 45:57.860
Yogi Bear will be there after the star has winked out of existence.

45:57.860 --> 46:01.220
Yeah, the stars wink out of existence and who still stands strong.

46:01.220 --> 46:03.140
I don't care how many movies they throw at him.

46:03.140 --> 46:04.820
Yogi Bear still.

46:04.820 --> 46:11.140
Okay, so the, but the fact that, that Teddy Ruxpin is an android doesn't come into effect.

46:11.140 --> 46:12.180
Burnt, burned.

46:12.180 --> 46:16.660
There's not an android that you can throw into a star that's going to like survive that shit.

46:17.700 --> 46:18.500
Just can't happen.

46:18.500 --> 46:24.900
There's no substance that it's certainly not Teddy Ruxpin, whatever he's made of felt burned to death.

46:24.900 --> 46:28.420
Justin has a pretty good argument actually with this eternal cartoon bear.

46:29.140 --> 46:29.700
Thank you.

46:29.700 --> 46:32.740
Which is funny because I feel like this is a rock-paper-scissors thing because I feel like

46:32.740 --> 46:35.220
Cyborg Bear could beat Yogi Bear.

46:38.740 --> 46:40.900
This is the new rock-paper-scissors is what you're saying.

46:40.900 --> 46:42.180
We need to put some branding on this.

46:42.180 --> 46:42.660
Yeah.

46:42.660 --> 46:45.620
That is, Ursa Major, Teddy Ruxpin, Yogi Bear.

46:45.620 --> 46:53.460
I actually have a problem with what Travis is saying because much like, like the legend of some

46:53.460 --> 47:00.260
people and like characters from history will outlive them.

47:00.260 --> 47:05.220
Even if he killed Yogi Bear, Yogi Bear, if he struck Yogi Bear down, so I'm saying he would

47:05.220 --> 47:09.380
arise more powerful than your Cyborg Bear could possibly imagine, mainly because your Cyborg Bear

47:09.380 --> 47:13.700
doesn't have a soul, which if there's one thing Yogi Bear certainly does, it's a lot of heart.

47:13.700 --> 47:14.020
Okay.

47:14.020 --> 47:15.300
Let me pitch this situation.

47:16.740 --> 47:20.100
One of the stars up in Ursa Major goes rogue.

47:20.740 --> 47:21.300
Yes.

47:21.300 --> 47:26.340
Like in that, like in that Lars von Trier movie, the name of which escapes me.

47:26.340 --> 47:26.980
Rogue Star.

47:26.980 --> 47:27.940
Rogue Star.

47:27.940 --> 47:29.780
I think it was a planet in that movie.

47:29.780 --> 47:32.260
I think it was called like Super-

47:32.260 --> 47:32.740
Armageddon.

47:32.740 --> 47:33.540
Super Sadness.

47:34.340 --> 47:34.840
Okay.

47:36.900 --> 47:42.420
This star comes flung from Ursa Major, travels at the speed of light,

47:42.420 --> 47:49.380
destroys our solar system, just burns it all up, burns up every Teddy Ruxpin doll that was

47:49.380 --> 47:55.460
ever produced, burns up all the celluloid, and every person that ever watched an episode

47:55.460 --> 48:03.060
of Yogi Bear, it burns up Hanna-Barbera land in King's Island, just like destroys the whole thing,

48:03.060 --> 48:06.260
and there's like nobody left to like carry on these two legacies.

48:07.700 --> 48:08.420
Okay.

48:08.420 --> 48:09.460
Let me counterpoint.

48:09.460 --> 48:10.020
Okay.

48:10.020 --> 48:15.700
As that's happening, Teddy Ruxpin learns to forgive and thereby wins a moral victory.

48:15.700 --> 48:18.500
But Teddy Ruxpin has been evaporated.

48:18.500 --> 48:26.900
Yes, but he was able to forgive Ursa Major, and so he is the victor in the confrontation.

48:26.900 --> 48:32.340
The problem is we've been broadcasting Yogi Bear cartoons for over 50 years now.

48:32.340 --> 48:33.380
They've been done every-

48:33.380 --> 48:34.900
The fucking radio broadcast.

48:34.900 --> 48:35.940
Ruxpin had a cartoon.

48:35.940 --> 48:36.420
Yes.

48:36.420 --> 48:37.460
Ruxpin had a cartoon.

48:37.460 --> 48:37.940
Okay.

48:37.940 --> 48:43.780
Yeah, but they were predated by, like I'm saying, by the time Yogi Bear reaches Beetlejuice

48:43.780 --> 48:48.500
to the planet, those, sorry, yes, it's a planet, well, yeah, the planet-

48:48.500 --> 48:50.420
No, it's super, super not.

48:50.420 --> 48:50.660
Okay.

48:50.660 --> 48:52.580
One of the planets around Beetlejuice, you know what I'm saying?

48:52.580 --> 48:52.900
Thank you.

48:52.900 --> 48:58.980
So once the broadcast from Yogi Bear hits them, it's the only message they've ever received,

48:58.980 --> 49:01.460
they think of Yogi Bear as a deity.

49:01.460 --> 49:06.100
So that time your Teddy Ruxpin signal arrives at the planet near Beetlejuice-

49:06.100 --> 49:06.500
Oh my God.

49:06.500 --> 49:08.020
You will see him the bear antichrist.

49:08.020 --> 49:08.420
There will be-

49:08.420 --> 49:10.180
He will be a heretic, is what I'm saying.

49:10.180 --> 49:11.380
There will be a splinter group-

49:11.380 --> 49:12.020
False bear!

49:12.020 --> 49:12.580
Of Beetlejuice-

49:12.580 --> 49:13.220
False bear!

49:13.220 --> 49:18.340
There will be a splinter group of Beetlejuicians that adopt him as their god.

49:18.340 --> 49:21.940
There's a horrible, horrible civil war that breaks out on this bit.

49:21.940 --> 49:23.620
Oh no, what's that in the sky?

49:23.620 --> 49:25.460
It's Ursa Major's butt star.

49:27.140 --> 49:28.820
I win again, motherfuckers.

49:28.820 --> 49:29.780
2-0.

49:29.780 --> 49:31.380
2-0-0.

49:31.380 --> 49:32.260
Do you think they would-

49:32.260 --> 49:36.740
Wait, so the stars become sentient and is seeking out any remnants of Yogi Bear's

49:36.740 --> 49:38.340
antichrist in the galaxy.

49:40.820 --> 49:42.740
This is how the universe ends.

49:42.740 --> 49:43.380
Not with a-

49:43.380 --> 49:45.060
Not with a bang, but with a no booboo.

49:46.340 --> 49:51.940
The problem is that by the time that the Beetlejuice planet has already, like,

49:51.940 --> 49:57.540
adopted Yogi Bear as its personal savior, they've already built a giant picnic basket

49:57.540 --> 50:01.140
shaped communications tower where they've started beaming out the message, the word,

50:02.740 --> 50:04.180
to all the other galaxies.

50:04.180 --> 50:05.140
You will never-

50:05.140 --> 50:06.740
You can't stop the signal.

50:06.740 --> 50:09.860
You will never catch the myth of Yogi Bear.

50:09.860 --> 50:12.340
It's moving at light speed in every direction of the galaxy.

50:12.340 --> 50:14.900
There's no way that it can be caught.

50:16.260 --> 50:17.300
Except by the Ranger.

50:18.660 --> 50:22.660
The only thing you could do, maybe I would grant you this, Griffin, and this is more

50:22.660 --> 50:28.180
than I should do for you because you have not earned this, but the only thing that your

50:29.140 --> 50:30.820
sentient star could do-

50:30.820 --> 50:37.460
Or sorry, your sentient collection of stars is if one of them were to volunteer to collapse

50:37.460 --> 50:42.980
and in doing so perhaps create some sort of possibility of time travel that would allow

50:42.980 --> 50:45.380
them to go back in time and kill William, Hannah, and Joseph, and Barbara.

50:45.380 --> 50:46.260
So one of the-

50:46.260 --> 50:53.540
Wait, so one of the stars collapses allowing the other stars to go back through to kill

50:54.180 --> 50:55.220
Hannah and or Barbara.

50:55.220 --> 51:01.700
Hannah and Barbara one day while beginning to do the sketches that would first-

51:01.700 --> 51:02.500
Hey, I have an idea.

51:02.500 --> 51:04.820
This is my favorite Doctor Who episode.

51:04.820 --> 51:06.900
Tell me about your idea, Hannah.

51:06.900 --> 51:09.060
Oh man, it's totally sick.

51:09.060 --> 51:14.500
What if there's like Jellystone Park and there's like a bear, super hungry, got a little friend,

51:14.500 --> 51:15.140
ranger's kind of-

51:15.140 --> 51:18.020
He's kind of like Ed Norton on the Honeymooners.

51:18.660 --> 51:19.620
What do you think?

51:19.620 --> 51:20.660
I think that's great.

51:20.660 --> 51:25.140
And can I tell you how much I love this open office space that we have with the skylight?

51:25.140 --> 51:26.580
Hey, look up through the skylight.

51:26.580 --> 51:28.900
There's a singularity in the clouds.

51:28.900 --> 51:33.140
25 stars come storming in like, what's up?

51:33.140 --> 51:35.780
What's up?

51:35.780 --> 51:36.660
Heretic.

51:36.660 --> 51:38.100
Now, here's the problem though.

51:38.100 --> 51:38.660
Shit.

51:38.660 --> 51:41.700
One of the stars has to agree to collapse and you know how stars are.

51:41.700 --> 51:42.660
Yeah, that's true.

51:42.660 --> 51:44.340
They are not going to be thinking big picture.

51:44.340 --> 51:44.740
No.

51:44.740 --> 51:46.260
They're going to think, well, not me.

51:46.260 --> 51:47.620
So you know what happens.

51:47.620 --> 51:48.740
What about Daryl the star?

51:48.740 --> 51:49.060
25.

51:49.060 --> 51:49.940
Maybe he could collapse.

51:49.940 --> 51:52.260
He's the last one to join up in the constellation.

51:52.260 --> 51:53.460
Lots of people don't even count.

51:53.460 --> 51:55.300
Without Daryl, it's just a bear with a shorter tail.

51:55.300 --> 52:02.100
25 of the other stars murder one of the other stars and that is where sin came from.

52:02.100 --> 52:03.060
That's original sin.

52:03.060 --> 52:05.860
When you read about original sin in the Bible, that's what it's talking about.

52:07.140 --> 52:07.940
That's amazing.

52:07.940 --> 52:11.300
I am glad that we were able to really play out this whole scenario.

52:11.300 --> 52:12.500
I do not know who won.

52:12.500 --> 52:16.260
I think it was mine because I killed Hannah Barbera.

52:16.900 --> 52:18.500
Still not as weird as Scientology though.

52:18.500 --> 52:18.900
No.

52:18.900 --> 52:20.420
Which is surprising.

52:21.460 --> 52:24.260
Man, we did that for like 30 minutes.

52:24.820 --> 52:25.940
Where do you go from there?

52:25.940 --> 52:26.820
I think we have to stop.

52:26.820 --> 52:27.860
Let's do one more.

52:27.860 --> 52:29.860
Let's do one more regular question.

52:30.580 --> 52:31.080
Okay.

52:31.080 --> 52:35.240
I'm getting married within weeks and I want to make my wedding night a special one for

52:35.240 --> 52:36.600
my soon-to-be husband.

52:36.600 --> 52:39.960
I'm not interested in making it a hypersexual experience.

52:40.600 --> 52:42.280
I want to do something more interesting.

52:42.280 --> 52:43.000
Any ideas?

52:43.560 --> 52:45.000
You'll give me a cosplay.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.040
Yeah, you'll give me a cosplay.

52:46.040 --> 52:47.400
That sounds pretty hypersexual to me.

52:47.400 --> 52:55.000
How like, oh man, do you think this person has like gone through systematically the

52:55.000 --> 53:01.800
Extreme Restraints library, the Extreme Restraints catalog, and has exhausted every product on

53:01.800 --> 53:05.000
there like, ah, sex is just so passe for me.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.280
Well, maybe she's not, maybe she doesn't want it to be all about sex.

53:08.280 --> 53:12.120
Maybe she wants something to get about like the emotional magic of like, now we are one,

53:12.120 --> 53:15.000
now we are bonded, now we are forever in love.

53:15.880 --> 53:21.880
Anything that you do, you are going to run the risk of making him feel guilty that he

53:21.880 --> 53:23.560
did not also do something.

53:23.560 --> 53:28.440
If you put together like a photo collage of like your greatest moments, all your greatest

53:28.440 --> 53:31.560
hits, then he's going to just look around the room and be like, I got you hotel soap.

53:33.000 --> 53:33.960
I got this for you.

53:33.960 --> 53:38.440
It's special, reminds me of, remember that hotel we stayed at that one time the night

53:38.440 --> 53:39.240
we got married?

53:39.240 --> 53:40.520
I saved the soap.

53:40.520 --> 53:41.800
That is an excellent point.

53:41.800 --> 53:43.960
No matter what, get a hotel room.

53:43.960 --> 53:47.960
Even if you're like getting married next door to your house, get a hotel room.

53:47.960 --> 53:48.760
Do not go home.

53:49.480 --> 53:50.200
Yeah, don't go home.

53:50.200 --> 53:51.080
That will make it special.

53:51.080 --> 53:52.040
Location is important.

53:52.040 --> 53:55.880
So find a place where you can maybe get a nice suite.

53:55.880 --> 53:58.360
Don't make it about sex, make it about relaxing.

53:59.800 --> 54:03.080
Get a suite with like a nice jacuzzi tub in it and get some-

54:03.080 --> 54:04.600
Order some fancy cocktails.

54:05.800 --> 54:13.080
Get a gravy hose and then if you do decide to turn up the sex, then you have that just

54:13.080 --> 54:14.040
like on hand.

54:14.040 --> 54:17.320
You got the graveyard there, you can do a gravy in the jacuzzi bath, turn on the jets,

54:17.320 --> 54:20.520
get gravy jets, and then just see where the mood takes you.

54:20.520 --> 54:23.720
I can tell you where the mood's going to take you when there's gravy jets in play.

54:23.720 --> 54:24.840
To the Golden Corral?

54:24.840 --> 54:25.640
Right to the Golden Corral.

54:26.280 --> 54:27.160
Right to the Golden Corral.

54:28.200 --> 54:32.920
Get a nice room, make it about relaxing together because you guys are going to be so exhausted.

54:32.920 --> 54:39.400
You just planned a wedding, you just met everybody you've ever known and they've all told you

54:39.400 --> 54:40.600
how happy they were for you.

54:40.600 --> 54:42.120
That's emotionally exhausting.

54:42.120 --> 54:44.360
Just make it like a nice relaxing time.

54:44.360 --> 54:49.160
I mean, Theresa and I wrapped up in robes and watched like HGTV while we ate chocolate

54:49.160 --> 54:51.000
covered strawberries and drank champagne.

54:51.560 --> 54:52.040
Perfect.

54:52.040 --> 54:54.440
And then you had sex.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.520
I don't want to talk about this.

54:58.520 --> 55:01.640
Justin, did you not like express yourself sexually?

55:02.360 --> 55:06.360
I would rather talk about anything including Darfur.

55:08.680 --> 55:16.040
You have to like have a conceptual release and like a consensual release and a physical

55:16.040 --> 55:16.520
release.

55:16.520 --> 55:21.000
You have to have three different releases on your wedding night because it's like symbolic

55:21.000 --> 55:22.760
and it's like love.

55:22.760 --> 55:23.560
And a press release.

55:23.560 --> 55:24.280
It's like love.

55:24.280 --> 55:28.040
Well, you do that the next morning when your aunt is like, so how was it?

55:29.240 --> 55:30.280
Dateline.

55:30.280 --> 55:31.000
I had sex.

55:33.400 --> 55:35.160
Breaking over the wire last night.

55:35.720 --> 55:37.000
Jim Parsons had sex.

55:38.840 --> 55:41.240
I didn't mean to summon up the star of Big Bang Theory.

55:41.240 --> 55:41.720
Yeah, Jesus.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.840
I've got a Big Bang Theory.

55:44.840 --> 55:46.520
He had sex last night.

55:48.120 --> 55:53.240
Guys, this has been a very enjoyable time that I've enjoyed having with you until Griffin

55:53.240 --> 55:54.840
tried to go this into talking about sex.

55:55.720 --> 55:58.120
I don't want to hear about like your sex lives.

55:58.120 --> 56:05.800
I just want to know that you indulged in the carnal release.

56:05.800 --> 56:08.280
Does it make it easier to talk about when we say carnal release?

56:09.960 --> 56:14.440
I think Justin is dead, so I don't think it made it much easier.

56:14.440 --> 56:16.840
You guys were breaking up for a bit, but now you're back.

56:16.840 --> 56:18.200
We're talking about carnal release.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.280
I don't want to do that now.

56:20.280 --> 56:20.600
Okay.

56:21.320 --> 56:26.120
We do have a lot to talk about though, so let's wrap it up like one would before they

56:26.120 --> 56:26.680
have sex.

56:28.520 --> 56:29.320
Gross.

56:29.320 --> 56:30.760
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

Why is safe sex gross?

56:32.760 --> 56:33.000

56:33.000 --> 56:35.320
No, it's just talking about sex with you guys is gross.

58:16.620 --> 58:17.660

58:27.500 --> 58:31.420

58:31.420 --> 58:34.060
Thank you to John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song.

58:34.060 --> 58:36.860
It's a departure, which is on the album, putting the days to bed.

58:36.860 --> 58:37.900
It's a terrific album.

58:37.900 --> 58:44.300
It's just listening to John Roderick and Jonathan Colton's Christmas album, which is, which

58:44.300 --> 58:45.340
is similarly great.

58:45.340 --> 58:50.300
We don't have a theme song off that album, but it's, it's good to also make sure you

58:50.300 --> 58:52.300
listen to all the other maximum fun podcasts.

58:52.300 --> 58:56.380
We just got five brand new, four brand new shows and one brand new host.

58:57.340 --> 58:58.140
They're so great.

58:58.140 --> 58:58.940
What have you guys been?

58:58.940 --> 58:59.820
They're all really great.

58:59.820 --> 59:05.180
I was redoing my office last week and I listened to listen to all of them.

59:05.180 --> 59:12.300
Like, um, I wouldn't recommend all of them, but especially I really liked a song exploder,

59:12.940 --> 59:15.660
which is very good, which is a very, very brief.

59:15.660 --> 59:20.220
I think it's like 11 minutes, uh, podcast, uh, where they take songs apart and talk about

59:20.220 --> 59:21.340
how they made them.

59:21.340 --> 59:25.820
I also really liked the goose down is, is super, super funny.

59:25.820 --> 59:31.660
Um, so check them and I haven't got a chance, um, is it Oh, no Ross and Kerry Ross and carries

59:31.660 --> 59:35.180
and I like go on where they talk about, um, the concept of it to me.

59:35.180 --> 59:37.980
I haven't got a chance to listen to it yet, but it looks fascinating.

59:37.980 --> 59:38.620
I can't wait to listen.

59:38.620 --> 59:39.340
You would like it.

59:39.340 --> 59:43.740
It's, it's almost like a mix of like saw bones and in case of emergency, it's yeah, they

59:43.740 --> 59:48.620
explore like French science and religious groups and they join cults and everything.

59:48.620 --> 59:49.500
It sounds really cool.

59:49.500 --> 59:49.900
