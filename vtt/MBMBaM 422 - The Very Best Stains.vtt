00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:46.960
Hello, baby, welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the

00:46.960 --> 00:52.720
Machinera. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

00:52.720 --> 00:59.760
McElroy. And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. I feel like I don't even know that I can

00:59.760 --> 01:08.000
call myself that anymore. Boys, I got some pa- I got some packages today. They arrived- they arrived

01:08.000 --> 01:12.800
in the mail, and when I opened all of them- when I bought these packages, or rather the things inside

01:12.800 --> 01:18.080
of them, I didn't- I didn't think that they created a narrative, but then when I opened them all up and

01:18.080 --> 01:25.040
laid the contents out, I realized this sort of through line there. And let me start off by saying

01:25.040 --> 01:29.920
I don't really use Twitter pretty much at all anymore, but whenever I do dip my beak in, I'm

01:29.920 --> 01:37.920
still getting a lot of, you know, uh, memes, uh, teen- teen memes, and weird- weird humor that like-

01:37.920 --> 01:42.720
Oh, I love that stuff. I love that weird humor, that kind of like, where are they coming from? What do

01:42.720 --> 01:49.040
they even mean? Sure, and I think I'm getting it mostly because I'm the- I am the only boy- you two

01:49.040 --> 01:54.400
are men now, and I'm still the- I guess I'm still the only boy of the podcast. Oh, thank you. I open

01:54.400 --> 01:59.440
up these packages. They are mostly things I bought in preparation for our, uh, our Disney World trip

01:59.440 --> 02:07.440
next week, uh, as we, uh, as we brave the wilds of, uh, Flowrider. And so there was a fanny pack,

02:07.440 --> 02:14.320
and I did get that for- It's waterproof. It's waterproof. There's pictures on- I got this one

02:14.320 --> 02:18.320
off Amazon, and there's pictures of a guy wearing it, and the guy looks really cool, like a handsome

02:18.320 --> 02:23.520
model boy, and he's wearing it, and he's got it, you know, slung to the side. That's cool. He's-

02:23.520 --> 02:28.000
Where's it- Is it one of the ones that I picked for you? No, no, no. I- you- Travis sent me some

02:28.000 --> 02:32.720
great suggestions, but I found a- I found a nice one. He also wears it like a sling bag messenger

02:32.720 --> 02:37.520
bag over his back, and it's like, is that even dumber? Because I feel like if I wear a fanny pack

02:37.520 --> 02:42.960
like it was a backpack, that's gonna make it seem like a big joke, but I did buy this. I just want

02:42.960 --> 02:48.480
to have like a huge laugh at you, uh, and not buy one for myself because it's a great idea, because

02:48.480 --> 02:52.720
god, that'd be very useful. Yeah, yeah. I sort of saw like certain places I should look for a great

02:52.720 --> 02:57.840
fanny pack. I'll send you some links. I'll jokingly send you some links that I was looking at,

02:57.840 --> 03:03.120
Justin, if you want. It'll be a funny, ironic thing, but also very practical and useful when

03:03.120 --> 03:09.600
we're in the Disney. Um, the other thing that showed up is some Tevas, which is the kind of

03:09.600 --> 03:15.040
sandals that, if they were still making, like, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids movies that Rick Moranis

03:15.040 --> 03:20.880
would exclusively wear, um, they're the- they're the- just the- they're just boys. These are some

03:20.880 --> 03:25.600
goof troupe, what are those geek shoes. They're really rough, but they're supposed to be really

03:25.600 --> 03:30.480
comfortable. I got these, I put them on, and I instantly felt myself age 20 years, and I also

03:30.480 --> 03:34.400
noticed that there's a buckle. I can't strap them on the right way and tighten them the right way

03:34.400 --> 03:38.880
so that this buckle that's like on the heel isn't going to rub and give me blisters, and so I did

03:38.880 --> 03:43.120
like do some googling about Tevas blisters, and a lot of people recommend that you do wear socks

03:43.120 --> 03:48.400
with them, so I think I'm pretty much dead at this. I think I'm a dead old- an old dead man

03:48.400 --> 03:56.080
and bad dad, and I don't think, um, I just- I- I just need to- this is a quick, I guess, brand update

03:56.080 --> 04:02.400
that is, uh, oh, I'm old and dead. And you're finally a dad. I'm an old dead dad Bones. Essentially,

04:02.400 --> 04:07.680
at this point, yes, a big walking skeleton dad who loves the eagles and wears Tevas with socks with

04:07.680 --> 04:12.000
his- and when he rides a water ride on Disney World, I'll just ball up the socks, shove it in

04:12.000 --> 04:17.040
my waterproof fanny pack, I have it all figured out. I am old Bones. That is a definite, uh, see,

04:17.040 --> 04:22.800
I would never ride a water ride, and I think it's maybe- if I was doing kind of a new Jeff Fox-worthy

04:22.800 --> 04:30.320
bit, if he was coming back for a second, like, you know you're a grown-up when, uh, you- people say

04:30.320 --> 04:33.760
we're going on this water ride, and you think, I'm not going to walk around and squish your shoes all

04:33.760 --> 04:41.840
the time. No thanks. No way. On earth, no thanks. There's another thing I got, and it's, um, a book

04:41.840 --> 04:47.520
of sheet music for the adult piano classes I'm taking, um, and this is in the same package as

04:47.520 --> 04:54.320
the Tevas and the fanny pack, and the book is called Adult Piano Adventures. So is it, like,

04:54.320 --> 04:59.680
erotic piano music? Yeah, I used to watch a blurry version of that on Cinemax that my parents didn't

04:59.680 --> 05:04.560
pay for. So just people asking me to, like, dab on them on Twitter just understand that, like,

05:04.560 --> 05:10.720
my arm might go flying out of its socket and, you know, land in the crowd of the Doobie Brothers

05:10.720 --> 05:16.400
concert that I'm at, because I can't anymore. He just can't. What are y'all's Disney World prep?

05:16.400 --> 05:20.480
Because y'all have been, I feel like, more recently than I have. I don't know. I'm afraid I'm literally-

05:20.480 --> 05:24.320
I- you google this shit, and it's supposed to be the most wonderful place on earth, and when you

05:24.320 --> 05:31.280
google it, all you find is, like, 50 dad blogs of people, like, you're gonna fucking die unless you

05:31.280 --> 05:37.920
bring these 80 things. You need a machete. You need some- you need twine. Put everything you own in

05:37.920 --> 05:43.920
baggies, and then look for this guy named Duke. He'll know what to do. He'll know what to do once

05:43.920 --> 05:48.160
you get there. Just start yelling for Duke, and if you see Duke, he's gonna carry you across the

05:48.160 --> 05:51.680
front lines, and then after that, you're on your own. You're gonna have this one knife that you

05:51.680 --> 05:56.640
can slip in your anus, and other than that, your life and death is up to you. And that has nothing

05:56.640 --> 06:01.840
to do with surviving the park. That's just something you can do for you. I just don't- I don't- I see

06:01.840 --> 06:05.920
the teacups, and I'm like, the teacups look fun, and it's like, the teacups will disintegrate your

06:05.920 --> 06:11.120
bones, so start eating lots of iron now, and if you don't eat iron every day for 60 days before

06:11.120 --> 06:15.520
going to Disney World, you can't ride the teacups. And it's like, wow, okay. Here's what they don't

06:15.520 --> 06:19.120
tell you, is that when you walk into the park, they take a picture of you, whether you want

06:19.120 --> 06:23.280
them to or not, and then they try to sell it to you. And when you leave the park, they give you

06:23.280 --> 06:28.960
a grade on how well you were actually prepared for the experience. Right. And most people, F minus.

06:28.960 --> 06:35.360
F minus. Well, with my Tavis, and my socks, and my fanny pack, and my adult piano book, if I can't

06:35.360 --> 06:40.720
at least pull down a C, then what's- what's- what's the fucking point of all this? Here's the amazing

06:40.720 --> 06:46.480
thing I've learned about myself in preparing for Disney. Um, when I was a younger, uh, man, I would

06:46.480 --> 06:53.280
have called myself, oh, Travis, so disorganized. Travis is- is quite, uh, the messy, unfocused boy.

06:53.280 --> 07:02.560
I find now, there is nothing I love more than a well-organized itinerary. I'm having so much fun

07:02.560 --> 07:10.400
making plans, because I basically go- we go from Disney to, uh, Dragon Con, and then I go to London

07:10.400 --> 07:17.840
Podfest. So I'm like, making like four different trips in one, and I'm loving it. The Disney

07:17.840 --> 07:24.240
planning is really, uh, smart, because I went there, uh, last fall, and it's really smart,

07:24.240 --> 07:30.400
because as soon as you show up, Mickey is gonna be like, haha, you made some plans, huh? Gonna fuck

07:30.400 --> 07:34.800
them. And then he just fucks them. Yeah. Right there in front of you? Yeah, he takes your plans,

07:34.800 --> 07:40.240
he tears it up into confetti, he puts it into a blender, he charges you 13 dollars for it,

07:40.240 --> 07:46.880
then sells it back to you, and force-feeds it to you. Whoa. And Goofy watches, and like, I know us,

07:46.880 --> 07:54.400
and there's- there's seldom a week- a week run where one of us doesn't have diarrhea. And that

07:54.400 --> 07:59.520
happens at Disney World, and that seems like it might be the ball- that might be a death scenario.

07:59.520 --> 08:07.280
It may be one of the rare times that those three diarrhea's line up at the same time. It's, uh,

08:07.280 --> 08:14.000
only every three years, the total eclipse of the fart, and it, uh, it is gonna be- it's a big- it's

08:14.000 --> 08:19.760
a big deal. And to happen that week, man, I- I can't even imagine. Justin, are you, uh, proud of

08:19.760 --> 08:27.040
yourself? I mean, I'm an accomplished entertainer, a father of two. And you also just said eclipse of

08:27.040 --> 08:30.960
the fart. That's what I want to know about, because I'm very proud of you. And now you've said it,

08:30.960 --> 08:35.600
and for- and in grand scope of history, we basically said it at the same moment. If you-

08:35.600 --> 08:42.400
if you take a cosmos zoom out on that to all of human history, we said it at the exact same

08:42.400 --> 08:48.400
nanosecond now. So we're both equally guilty, I guess. I have a thing to- I have a thing to say,

08:48.400 --> 08:53.360
and it's new. It's- A few words? Yeah, it's new, and- Here at the death of our show?

08:53.360 --> 08:57.200
Well, no, it's new and good, and, like, I just thought of it, and I think it could be, like,

08:57.200 --> 09:01.760
a- a funny joke. And sometimes we, like- and this is behind the scenes, but I will warn the

09:01.760 --> 09:05.040
boys that I have a joke coming up, and I'll say it. If it's not good, we'll just remove it,

09:05.040 --> 09:09.040
but I think this is gonna be a good one. And it's that I think I'm gonna need a vacation from this

09:09.040 --> 09:20.160
vacation. I love that. Can we start doing advice? This is advice. This is a special email that

09:20.160 --> 09:28.720
we're leading off with as a- a return. Our first ever two-parter. Our first ever, like,

09:28.720 --> 09:36.720
serial-style cliffhanger. We'll have more on that in the next week's episode. We got a version of-

09:36.720 --> 09:40.080
well, I'll read the original question, and then, uh, we'll follow up from there.

09:40.800 --> 09:46.400
Hi, brothers. I work at a grocery store, deli, in a rural area, and a few days ago someone came to

09:46.400 --> 09:52.480
the counter who I'm 95% sure is a moderately famous Hollywood actor. The actor is not known

09:52.480 --> 10:00.480
to have a house- uh, sorry? No, you read that right. Okay. This actor is not known to have a

10:00.480 --> 10:05.600
house about 15 to 20 minutes away from the store. I have to believe that that knot was a whoopsie

10:05.600 --> 10:10.480
doodle that shouldn't have been in there. Right, because where do you get that- where do you get

10:10.480 --> 10:15.600
that information? Like, how do you search that? Does this person- they're not known to. Okay,

10:15.600 --> 10:21.040
because would you search does this person have a house 15 to 20 minutes of me driving or walking?

10:21.600 --> 10:28.880
It's a very specific thing to say he doesn't do. Yeah, it's a wha- yeah, yeah. 99.9% of the earth

10:28.880 --> 10:34.320
is gonna say no to that sentence. Is gonna- is gonna jive with that. Okay, anyway. It's not known

10:34.320 --> 10:40.480
to have a house about 15 to 20 minutes away from the store. Now imagining a radius of like a 15

10:40.480 --> 10:45.600
to 20 minute drive surrounding the store, like they live in- they don't live in this window.

10:45.600 --> 10:49.440
They could be 10 minutes away, they could be 25 minutes away, we literally have no idea.

10:49.440 --> 10:55.360
I will say that I- even Cincinnati I would not say is a- is a rural area, and even here,

10:55.360 --> 11:02.000
if someone even- if a moderate, uh, moderately famous Hollywood actor even like rents an

11:02.000 --> 11:06.480
apartment for a day, like everyone in town knows about it. So- all right, people are- people are

11:06.480 --> 11:10.400
fucking dying because we haven't said who it is. Go. My question is this, should I have asked him

11:10.400 --> 11:15.520
if he really was a celebrity and told him I like his work, or did I do the right thing by just

11:15.520 --> 11:21.040
treating him like a normal customer? As well-known people yourselves, ha, do you prefer- I thank you-

11:21.040 --> 11:25.520
do you prefer to be recognized as you're going about your daily business, or would you rather

11:25.520 --> 11:30.960
be left alone to get your deli meat and peas? That's from Starstruckinthewoods, and it says

11:30.960 --> 11:37.520
follow up, and here's what y'all been waiting for. I'm pretty sure it was Louise Guzman.

11:38.240 --> 11:43.920
I believe he got some Black Forest ham. Thank you, I would have sent this fishy right back into the

11:43.920 --> 11:48.960
sea if you hadn't said what kind of sandwich they were looking for, so. Very exciting. I think

11:49.520 --> 11:54.160
it probably was Louise Guzman. Here's- okay, can I tell you my- I don't know the accent,

11:54.160 --> 12:00.000
I hope I'm doing the accent right. Guzman. Yes, Guzman. Okay, here's the thing, I strongly feel-

12:00.000 --> 12:07.360
I am- I think about this a lot. I think there are very few actors, performers, recognizable people

12:07.360 --> 12:14.800
that I would recognize on sight without someone saying, that is blank. I think I'd know for sure

12:14.800 --> 12:22.960
if it was Louise Guzman. Like, I don't- I don't think I'd have to ask somebody. You are so certain

12:22.960 --> 12:28.800
of this, Travis. I am! Like, I'm picturing Louise Guzman in my head, and I've got a crystal clear

12:28.800 --> 12:35.440
picture. Yeah. Just a quick update, he does live, according to his IMDB page, in Vermont, with,

12:35.440 --> 12:46.000
quote, his wife and many kids. I hear you, Louise, you and me, buddy. I- okay, so I can- here,

12:46.000 --> 12:51.600
let us personally address this, and I will be- and I think if you're a listener of ours, and on the

12:51.600 --> 12:56.000
off chance that you should spot us in the wild at some point, I want you to remember this exact

12:56.000 --> 13:02.880
thing I'm about to tell you. And I- I can't speak for everyone. I can't even really speak for everybody

13:02.880 --> 13:09.440
in our, like, certain specific class of people knowing who you are, because it's a very specific

13:09.440 --> 13:16.320
sort of prism through which our light has to be reflected, in which we look like actual celebrities,

13:16.320 --> 13:22.400
like Louise Guzman, I would argue. But for me, if I'm just walking around and about, and somebody's

13:22.400 --> 13:29.840
like, hey, you're Justin McElroy, um, I feel like, uh, pretty good. I feel like kind of a cool dude.

13:29.840 --> 13:35.760
Yeah. Kind of a cool- kind of a cool person who's done some cool stuff and has cool people enjoying

13:35.760 --> 13:40.400
what they do. It's a nice little ego boost, and if I'm with my kids, some people are like, oh,

13:40.400 --> 13:45.440
you're with your kids. I can- they can stand aside for a second. They're always here. They're always

13:45.440 --> 13:50.880
here. You're not. Hello. Hi. Thank you for this. Kate Welch- Kate Welch recently tweeted, uh,

13:50.880 --> 13:55.520
that someone had tweeted at her, saying, I saw you, but I didn't want to bother you. You were

13:55.520 --> 14:00.000
talking to your friends, and she responded, do you know how fucking cool you would have made me look?

14:00.000 --> 14:04.960
Yeah. Every time. Like, oh, Justin. It's so choice. It's so- that's what you- you hope for.

14:05.600 --> 14:10.320
There's a lot of things you can do, and let's maybe separate this from ourselves so I don't

14:10.320 --> 14:15.200
sound, um, you know, shitty when I say this, but let's just say, if you do want to approach Louise

14:15.200 --> 14:20.160
Guzman, there's a few things that you maybe shouldn't do, and that is, one is to not approach

14:20.160 --> 14:25.440
her, but then do tweet later, like, I saw you. That's not good for Louise- I saw you, Guz.

14:25.440 --> 14:30.880
I saw you, Louise Guzman. I, uh, I can- as long as we're- I did it just so it doesn't seem like

14:30.880 --> 14:36.000
her to come down and harm anybody. Did this exact thing to harm our superstar once. Guilty. Yeah,

14:36.000 --> 14:44.160
guilty. Um, saw him in the LAX bathroom. Uh, can I say, though, for me, personally,

14:44.160 --> 14:50.720
I don't- if I wasn't 100% sure it's Louise, and I would be, but if I wasn't, I don't think I'd

14:50.720 --> 14:54.960
pull the trigger on this one, because I don't think there's anything worse than, uh, saying

14:54.960 --> 14:59.040
you think somebody's somebody and then they're not that somebody, especially- The only- Yeah.

14:59.040 --> 15:06.960
The only way to kind of give yourself a little wiggle room out is just say, hey, I like your work.

15:06.960 --> 15:12.080
Don't say a name and see how they- because if they look at you and go, what? Then you say,

15:12.080 --> 15:14.960
never mind, I thought you were somebody else, right? But if you say the name,

15:15.760 --> 15:22.080
hey, Louise Guzman, and they're like, who the f- I'm not Louise Guzman. That is- I think that

15:22.640 --> 15:27.200
if you say, like, hey, I like your work, and they're like, oh, thank you very much,

15:27.200 --> 15:32.400
then, like, it's probably Louise Guzman. I mean, in this specific one, you could just go,

15:32.400 --> 15:36.640
oh, fuck yeah, Boogie Nights, and then if they're not Louise Guzman, they'll be like,

15:36.640 --> 15:43.040
like, um, yeah, it's a- it's a pretty good flick. Yeah. Do you want to buy it? I've got a copy.

15:43.040 --> 15:48.080
I have a copy of Boogie Nights. It's for you. I once did that with John C. Reilly,

15:48.080 --> 15:55.360
almost called him John C. McGinley from Scrubs. No way, no how. I did that I- when I met my now

15:55.360 --> 16:02.720
friend, um, uh, MC Frontalot, I told him how much I loved his work on Aqua Teen Hunger Force,

16:02.720 --> 16:11.600
which is MC Chris. Oh yeah, it's a different dude. I've, uh, never made this mistake, but I've never

16:11.600 --> 16:16.800
also talked to a celebrity, so I- yeah, it's going good for me in my life. If you're not,

16:16.800 --> 16:23.840
here's what- here's- here's would be my one, uh, I don't know, thing that would hang on this.

16:23.840 --> 16:28.000
The people that come out to us, and I think we're probably biased in this way, the people that come

16:28.000 --> 16:34.720
out to us are fans of what we make, right? Like, because you have to seek out our visages, if you

16:34.720 --> 16:40.640
would like to absorb them. You must seek out our visages, so you must be a fan of ours. Um, it sounds

16:40.640 --> 16:46.320
like maybe you just kind of know who Louise Guzman is, and maybe you don't know exactly what they

16:46.320 --> 16:52.640
look like, so maybe not the biggest fan. So it may kind of feel a little bit, I don't know, that may

16:52.640 --> 16:57.680
feel diff- I don't know any people- I know what you're saying. Who are actually famous that we could

16:57.680 --> 17:03.120
at- qual- qualify for this, but like, if somebody's like, hey, don't I know you from TV or something,

17:03.120 --> 17:08.080
I feel like that might feel kind of weird. Like, that might be less enjoyable. I tell you, it- it-

17:08.080 --> 17:12.800
this is like- this is like my number one thing, is I see, like, I've seen so many celebrities that

17:12.800 --> 17:17.040
I'm like, I recognize your face from a poster, but it feels super shitty to just be like, let me get

17:17.040 --> 17:23.920
a picture with you because some people not me know who you are. That's gross. That has actually happened

17:23.920 --> 17:28.160
to us before when a crowd of people have been around us, and someone will be like, I don't know

17:28.160 --> 17:31.680
who you are, but just in case, and they take a picture with us, okay? I feel like we should

17:31.680 --> 17:36.560
apologize to those people, like, nothing will ever come of this. Yeah. Let me save you the memory on

17:36.560 --> 17:44.080
your iPhone. Um, how about Yahoo? Yeah, yeah. This one was sent in by Merit Palmer. Thank you,

17:44.080 --> 17:49.040
Merit. It's Yahoo Answers User. They are anonymous. I'm gonna call them. Wait, hold on. Did we give

17:49.040 --> 17:54.400
that person concrete advice on what they should do in this situation, should it arise again?

17:54.400 --> 17:59.760
Yeah, it's just yell boogie nights. I felt like that was good. Yeah. Okay. Um, this anonymous user,

17:59.760 --> 18:08.080
I'll call him, uh, Ollie, asks, I just got hired at Starbucks, but I don't drink coffee. A friend of

18:08.080 --> 18:15.760
mine told me the first day, I have to try all the coffees. Can I opt out? Welcome to Starbucks,

18:15.760 --> 18:21.680
motherfucker. Open up. Here's the funnel. You're gonna hold this in your mouth and your butt,

18:21.680 --> 18:27.280
and we're gonna start partying. Here we go. Now, this is the Pike Place Roast. Uh, this is very

18:27.280 --> 18:32.720
good. This is the Caramel Macchiato. You're gonna love this. You don't love this? You don't love

18:32.720 --> 18:38.480
this. Okay, well, you work here, so, love it. You have to love all this different, that's a lot of

18:38.480 --> 18:43.840
different coffee, eh? It's like a lot of different coffee to try. Yeah, they have like four or five

18:43.840 --> 18:50.240
different ones. At least, and in the fall, they have six or seven. Sure. This is a wild, mmm.

18:51.440 --> 18:55.600
This is a, there's so many wild things about this. The first being like, this is definitely,

18:55.600 --> 19:00.000
there is no, they don't jump you into Starbucks by making you drink all their hot, hot beans.

19:00.640 --> 19:06.960
The other thing is, while you're working at the Starbucks, and I get it, times are tight, maybe

19:06.960 --> 19:10.800
this is the only job you could find, but I can't imagine walking into a Starbucks and being like,

19:10.800 --> 19:15.120
mmm, so what's good here? And the person saying like, nothing, coffee stinks, all of it stinks,

19:15.120 --> 19:21.360
it's gross, yuck, yuck, yuck. Do you want a water? Do you want a water? We do some juice, okay.

19:22.320 --> 19:27.120
This is a, this is a fun little language lesson, this question, because when your friend said,

19:27.680 --> 19:33.040
you have to, did they mean like, oh, you have to try, or like, you have to try it? Oh, yeah,

19:33.040 --> 19:37.760
I hate coffee. Oh, you have to try coffee? You didn't listen, you're not listening to me.

19:37.760 --> 19:42.080
Is it going to be weird that you don't like the coffee at Starbucks?

19:42.080 --> 19:44.640
It's going to be weird when somebody asks you what the best one is, and you're like,

19:44.640 --> 19:50.560
I love this one, and it's kind of, it tastes kind of like dirt, and it's like, it's like hot,

19:50.560 --> 19:54.160
dirt water, but like in a good way. Oh, so good, with just a little,

19:54.160 --> 19:58.400
there's some pumpkin in there, I think. Oh, it's so crunchy.

19:58.400 --> 20:02.320
Maybe the problem is that they drink it really fast, like right when it comes out of the pot,

20:02.320 --> 20:06.160
and they burn their mouth horribly every time they drink it, and so in their mind,

20:06.160 --> 20:09.600
coffee is a bad, coffee hurt. Coffee hurt.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.800
Coffee bad hot, and does hurt on the mouth and tongue.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.600
Coffee mouth. Yeah, and I don't think they know

20:15.600 --> 20:18.240
that you can let it cool down, and you can add ice to it.

20:18.240 --> 20:22.800
When I see someone drink fucking like right out the air pot coffee,

20:23.520 --> 20:27.840
it is like I am witnessing Superman with bullets bouncing off his chest.

20:28.640 --> 20:34.160
How, how, how do you, I get coffee and say, I'm going to enjoy this in 40 minutes.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.120
Yeah, right, I'll have this later. This is for later.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.760
I don't want coffee now, but maybe at 10 a.m. I will.

20:40.880 --> 20:47.440
You know, I'm thinking about it, and when I declared my allegiance to the country's best yogurt,

20:48.400 --> 20:51.200
I couldn't really eat much of that stuff because of my stomach shame,

20:51.920 --> 20:58.000
and there must have been times where people asked me my recs, and I had to sort of lie,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.640
and just be like, well, the cinnamon swirl is good.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.720
It's my favorite. I eat gallons of it. I'm, when I'm feeling bad,

21:04.720 --> 21:08.720
when I'm feeling bad, I will eat a gallon of this rocky road ice cream.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.800
And it definitely doesn't give me diarrhea.

21:11.440 --> 21:16.000
Yeah, my favorite thing about all of this sweet cream is that it doesn't make me tummy sick.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.120
I like the idea of it. Do you see me y-employee

21:19.120 --> 21:23.200
that just casually mentions that their metrics are in gallons?

21:25.200 --> 21:28.080
Oh, uh, uh, welcome to Madison Robbins,

21:28.080 --> 21:30.880
telling you what a flavor is. What can I get you today? What do you like?

21:30.880 --> 21:36.800
Well, yeah, last night I ate about a gallon of chocolate,

21:36.800 --> 21:39.200
so I can highly recommend that.

21:39.200 --> 21:43.680
Gonna eat a, today for lunch, gonna eat a gallon of quarterback crunch.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.200
So I'm feeling pretty pumped right now.

21:46.560 --> 21:49.600
Can I ask you a quick TCBY hack that I've always wondered?

21:49.600 --> 21:51.280
I would love nothing more.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.880
Can I just get a cup of jimmies?

21:53.680 --> 21:54.400
You can.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.360
I mean, is Todd working?

21:57.360 --> 22:00.720
Oh, if Todd's working, go for it.

22:02.160 --> 22:07.040
I'd say this, as an employee of TCBY, I can have a cup of jimmies in the back room.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.840
I can eat a whole cup of jimmies in the back room

22:09.840 --> 22:12.720
in the one spot where the two security cameras don't see.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.360
And it's right by the jackets.

22:15.360 --> 22:18.960
I can eat a whole thing of cheesecake top crumbles

22:18.960 --> 22:21.280
right there where the jackets are because there's two cameras,

22:21.280 --> 22:23.440
but they don't see right there where the jackets are.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.480
So I can hang out there and I can play Nintendo DS

22:26.480 --> 22:28.640
and I can eat my cheesecake crumbles in peace.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.000
And that's your time.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.280
And that's Griffin's time.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.440
That was the country's best yogurt's best corner

22:35.440 --> 22:37.280
for eating secret cheesecake bites.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.840
TCBYBC.

22:39.840 --> 22:40.400
You're right.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.520
It's a nail place now.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.520
Yeah, it's a, yeah.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.680
Still that corner though.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.760
Still that corner is where the secrets live.

22:51.760 --> 22:55.760
I have recently picked up skateboarding mostly as a way to get around faster.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.280
I don't know any tricks.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.560
That's not really my concern.

23:00.560 --> 23:01.120
That's quibble.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.320
That is your concern.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.400
Maybe it does not concern you.

23:04.400 --> 23:08.240
It would be under the category of your concerns.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.160
Who this concern belongs to.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.440
It's certainly not me.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.800
It's not my concern.

23:13.360 --> 23:14.640
If it's anybody's, anyway.

23:14.640 --> 23:20.000
However, I live in Edinburgh, which has a lot of cobbles

23:20.000 --> 23:23.200
and uneven pavements.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.240
And pretty much once per day, I find myself completely eating shit.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.640
Worse than the actual incident is when I have to walk awkwardly

23:33.840 --> 23:38.080
back to get my skateboard, which has shot meters and meters behind me.

23:39.520 --> 23:42.080
Who knows how far that is.

23:42.080 --> 23:42.640
Sounds far.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.920
Is there any way I can make the situation look any cooler?

23:47.920 --> 23:49.520
Don't tell me not to just fall.

23:49.520 --> 23:52.000
That's not an option I'm willing to consider.

23:54.320 --> 23:56.800
It's from McFallen in Marchmont.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.960
I mean, I got a suggestion.

23:58.960 --> 24:02.400
This, guys, this is wild.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.320
This is like saying I have this bike and I ride it to work every day.

24:06.320 --> 24:11.520
But at least once a day, one of the tires comes off and I flip over,

24:11.520 --> 24:14.640
end over end, and I land on my skull every day.

24:14.640 --> 24:16.880
Is there a way to make my fall look cooler?

24:16.880 --> 24:20.560
And it's like, you don't, you can't use this bike.

24:20.560 --> 24:25.040
Any form of transit that involves you eating shit on the daily

24:25.600 --> 24:28.480
is not an acceptable way to get around, I don't think.

24:28.480 --> 24:29.360
Here's what you do.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.400
Here's what you do.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.120
First, you're going to need like, like a boogie board has,

24:33.120 --> 24:34.640
like one of those like wrist straps.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.880
Maybe extra long, maybe it's very stretchy,

24:36.880 --> 24:40.640
like a long rubber band so that your skateboard can shoot backwards

24:40.640 --> 24:43.760
and then return to you, perhaps fast, and in a painful manner.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.680
And fast and in the teeth.

24:45.680 --> 24:50.000
But why, if you feel yourself start to fly off your skateboard,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.400
I want you to yell, I'm so sleepy.

24:53.280 --> 24:56.400
And then when you land, just pretend like you're taking a nap there.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.280
Yeah, that's good.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.200
So you're skateboarding and somebody's like, do a trick.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.640
And you're like, ha ha, I'll do it.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.080
Aw, fuck, bedtime.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.720
And then you just lay there for a bit and then pop up and yawn and stretch.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.720
And then back, back to your ride.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.560
I feel good.

25:16.560 --> 25:20.960
All right, I would argue, Travis, as we had a lot of fun there,

25:20.960 --> 25:23.600
but that does not get your skateboard back to you.

25:23.600 --> 25:28.160
In fact, I'm pretty sure it gets it stolen and you're arrested as a vagrant.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.320
Maybe tape it to your feet?

25:30.960 --> 25:31.440
Here's what-

25:31.440 --> 25:33.200
Tape it to your feet is good.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.560
You know the child leashes?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.280
That you tape on to kids?

25:38.160 --> 25:38.880
Well, you don't tape.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.480
You see, you said tape, it fucks me up.

25:40.480 --> 25:44.240
But you like, you like tie them to your kids and it's like your kid can run,

25:44.240 --> 25:47.440
but then it's like yank and they pull them back to you.

25:47.440 --> 25:49.040
That is literally what I just said.

25:49.600 --> 25:49.760
What?

25:49.760 --> 25:51.200
That's literally what Travis said.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.440
Yeah, but I have a different one that I'm going to do different.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.760
It's a different style.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.440
Oh, okay.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.400
Mine's different.

26:00.400 --> 26:00.960
Go on.

26:01.760 --> 26:10.800
Okay, so what if it's like that, but it's made of Twizzler?

26:10.800 --> 26:17.440
So after you do it, you could just be like, everybody might still laugh at you,

26:17.440 --> 26:21.120
but then it's like, hey, can we all enjoy this together over some Twizzlers?

26:21.120 --> 26:25.440
And then maybe they would not be mad at you because you got them that Twizzler.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.680
Of course, it's perfect.

26:28.560 --> 26:32.080
I'll tell you what you need to do is you need to pop off those little shitty tires,

26:32.080 --> 26:34.240
I mean wheels that you have on your skateboard,

26:34.240 --> 26:36.080
and you gotta put on some monster truck wheels.

26:37.200 --> 26:40.080
Something that can really eat those cobblestones the fuck up.

26:40.080 --> 26:43.920
Because if you can't find a non-cobblestone route on your way to work,

26:44.480 --> 26:47.760
then I genuinely think you need either a new foreign transit

26:47.760 --> 26:50.400
or just some real monster truck tires on your skateboard.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.960
And maybe get an engine on there and get that-

26:52.960 --> 26:53.520
That'd be good.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.800
You got to have power.

26:55.440 --> 27:01.120
So four big wheels, an engine, maybe get a windshield, some seats.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.560
You have to get off to the races.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.920
I'll tell you what would help keep your skateboard attached to you

27:05.920 --> 27:09.840
is a seat belt attaching you to the seat of the skateboard car.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.800
What if you got Nissan on there somewhere?

27:12.800 --> 27:14.480
Right, Nissan right on the skateboard, yeah.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.640
And windshield wipers because it gets rainy.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.560
Maybe, here's what you do, right?

27:18.560 --> 27:20.320
Skateboard on your feet.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.840
Yes, yes, of course, obviously.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.160
Skateboard on your hands and on top of your head.

27:24.720 --> 27:29.360
So that way, as you're tumbling, now you're just doing a handstand and skateboarding.

27:29.360 --> 27:29.840
You're not-

27:30.400 --> 27:31.360
No, that doesn't work?

27:31.360 --> 27:33.280
I'm hearing a no from Justin.

27:33.280 --> 27:37.360
Can you, can you, can you, can you hire Tony Hawk?

27:37.360 --> 27:39.360
Ooh, to skate for you.

27:39.360 --> 27:41.440
Y'all listen, you feel a crash coming on.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.800
And you try, you can try to make it look like a trick,

27:44.800 --> 27:47.200
but you make your body go into a big bush.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.760
And then a bunch of teens or construction workers

27:49.760 --> 27:52.720
or students walking to class are going to see you point and laugh.

27:52.720 --> 27:56.000
And then Tony Hawk wearing the clothes that you were just wearing

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
that you put on that morning comes out of the bush.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.120
And he does a whole 900 and continues the skateboard.

28:01.120 --> 28:03.600
And then people think like, wow, you're so cool.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.720
Or maybe after you go into the bush and people start laughing,

28:06.720 --> 28:08.320
Tony Hawk just walks up to them and says,

28:08.320 --> 28:11.280
hey, don't laugh, everybody falls off their skateboard.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.840
Even I, Tony Hawk, have fallen off my skateboard.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.520
And then they feel really bad.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.240
And they think maybe we're the accident.

28:19.920 --> 28:24.160
Here's one I want to, here's one you could do.

28:24.880 --> 28:25.360
You listen?

28:26.400 --> 28:27.200
Yeah.

28:27.200 --> 28:27.600
Yeah.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.200
All right, I just want to make sure because it's really good.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.760
You could cover yourself.

28:31.760 --> 28:35.280
I mean, really cover yourself in glow sticks

28:35.280 --> 28:38.640
that you have to break to make work.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.960
And then when you fall, just be like,

28:40.960 --> 28:43.040
aw shit, folks, the party started.

28:43.040 --> 28:48.880
And you'll be like, make sure to buy a Juicero.

28:48.880 --> 28:49.280
That's right.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.800
It's a startup promotion.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.440
And they pay me to do this all around town.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.680
And buy a Juicero and look by everything.

28:55.680 --> 28:56.560
It's all glowing.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.360
And then you can pass off the glow sticks to people

28:59.360 --> 29:01.120
and we'll be like, instant party.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.240
Just right there.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.040
Instant party.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.200
Yeah, that's good.

29:05.200 --> 29:10.720
If we can invent some sort of impact sensing boom box

29:10.720 --> 29:12.240
that you could also have attached to yourself

29:12.240 --> 29:16.240
that when it could sense a quick shift in speed or momentum,

29:16.240 --> 29:18.320
it starts playing LMFAO.

29:18.320 --> 29:20.480
And then things really, really get going.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.000
Yeah, this is good stuff, Justin.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.560
Could we also do pinatas all over at the very least?

29:27.440 --> 29:28.160
Wonderballs.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.640
Wait, wait, wait.

29:30.640 --> 29:32.000
Wait.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.320
Smaller skateboard in your backpack.

29:34.320 --> 29:40.880
Oh, so if you crash, you stand up, you pull, you wait.

29:41.760 --> 29:43.120
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.000
I got it.

29:44.000 --> 29:44.800
This will work.

29:44.800 --> 29:45.440
This will work.

29:46.400 --> 29:47.120
You crash.

29:48.400 --> 29:52.160
You lie there until people just move on.

29:52.160 --> 29:57.120
And then no one will still be there that saw you crash initially.

29:57.120 --> 30:04.240
And then you stand up and pull a smaller skateboard out of your backpack

30:04.240 --> 30:07.920
and loudly announce, well, time to start skateboarding for the day.

30:13.120 --> 30:15.120
I think that could fly.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.240
Here's what I love most about that, Justin.

30:18.800 --> 30:22.560
What you are envisioning is that I, a bystander,

30:22.560 --> 30:27.280
would see a human fly off the skateboard and then lay still.

30:29.280 --> 30:34.080
After a few moments, I would go, huh, and walk away.

30:34.080 --> 30:35.840
It's a cynical plan, I admit.

30:35.840 --> 30:38.720
It's a little black mirror for my taste, for sure.

30:40.400 --> 30:43.040
I like to believe I would help the skateboard man,

30:43.040 --> 30:46.000
but I know deep down I wouldn't, and neither would you.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.960
No, I just assume it was a YouTube prank.

30:48.960 --> 30:49.520
You're right.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.680
Uh, let's go the money zone.

30:53.280 --> 30:53.920
Wow, okay.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.480
I mean, romance me a little bit with it, you know?

30:56.480 --> 30:57.760
Whoa!

30:57.760 --> 31:01.840
Yeah, you just sounded like a businessman, like moving to the next part of the-

31:01.840 --> 31:02.960
I'll do a segway.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.800
Okay, yeah, good.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.320
No, he wasn't riding a segway, Justin.

31:06.320 --> 31:07.440
He was riding a skateboard.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.280
God in heaven, Trav.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.040
No, that wasn't money zone worthy?

31:13.040 --> 31:15.520
No, it wasn't fucking money zone worthy, bud.

31:15.520 --> 31:16.720
You have to know that, right?

31:16.720 --> 31:19.200
Well, like a segway is another thing you can ride and fall on.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.280
I was trying to make it work in my head, Griff.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.320
I couldn't, and I couldn't.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.240
I know, Jesus, I was working on it too.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.560
Travis didn't let that slow him down.

31:26.560 --> 31:27.760
He just went for it.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.880
I was trying to make it work.

31:29.440 --> 31:32.160
It's a segway, you know, which is another means of conveyance.

31:33.040 --> 31:36.480
He's explaining it so much, like that's gonna save it, but it's not saving it.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.520
It's making it stinkier.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.560
Because you would fall on a skateboard, or you could fall on a segway.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.320
I might just fade this out.

31:42.320 --> 31:45.760
This might be our first fade out, not hard cut, just fade out into money zone.

31:45.760 --> 31:48.240
What if we scoot on over to the money zone?

31:48.240 --> 31:49.520
Yeah, what if we...

31:49.520 --> 31:50.480
More, more, more, more, yeah.

31:50.480 --> 31:53.040
Because this is just getting quieter and quieter.

31:53.040 --> 31:53.920
I started to...

32:09.760 --> 32:14.240
Bowen Branch has a special message for you.

32:14.240 --> 32:18.480
Okay, folks, they want to unite the world.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.440
Now, what do I mean by that?

32:19.440 --> 32:21.360
It sounds a little grandiose.

32:21.360 --> 32:25.840
You know, there's so few things that unite us as a world, but you know what?

32:26.560 --> 32:29.760
In the night, we're all going to sleep.

32:29.760 --> 32:30.400
Not Batman.

32:31.040 --> 32:31.840
Not Batman.

32:31.840 --> 32:34.320
Batman is sleeping, though, at some point during the day.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.960
When does Batman sleep?

32:36.960 --> 32:39.920
Yeah, I don't think so, because he's Bruce Wayne during the day, Justin.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.280
That's probably why he's so cranky.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.120
You'll never believe this, honey.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.440
Guess who I met today in a big business meeting?

32:45.440 --> 32:46.160
Who?

32:46.160 --> 32:47.280
Bruce Wayne.

32:47.280 --> 32:47.920
How was he?

32:48.480 --> 32:49.280
So tired.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.400
He seemed like fucking exhausted.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.680
I don't know how that dude's so rich.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.880
Bowen Branch makes sheets.

32:56.880 --> 32:59.200
Really, really excellent sheets.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.200
Thousands of five-star reviews.

33:01.200 --> 33:06.320
Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, and Fast Company are all talking about Bowen Branch.

33:06.320 --> 33:10.960
The shipping, well, it's free, which is one of the lower prices

33:10.960 --> 33:15.200
available to you as a consumer, and you can try them for 30 nights.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.600
If you don't love them, you send them back for a refund.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.840
But I doubt that you'll want to send them back.

33:19.840 --> 33:23.200
There's no risk and no reason not to give them a try.

33:24.000 --> 33:24.960

My brother.

33:45.360 --> 33:47.440
I'm sorry I called you a coward, everybody.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.040
You're not a coward.

33:49.040 --> 33:50.080
You're great.

33:50.080 --> 33:52.000
Do you want a Stitch Fix ad?

33:52.560 --> 33:53.040
There it comes.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.000
I get the Stitch Fix every month.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.080
It's a box, and inside the box is five different clothes.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.320
And sometimes the clothes are pants, and sometimes they're not.

34:03.360 --> 34:04.400
It changes every time.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.760
And you get a stylist, and they figure out what looks good on your bod,

34:07.760 --> 34:09.920
and then you get, you're gonna get it.

34:09.920 --> 34:12.960
And there's a little sheet of paper, and it shows you how you could maybe dress it up

34:12.960 --> 34:17.120
to look like a, you know, like a mannequin at a store.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.480
You know how you see them wearing clothes.

34:18.480 --> 34:21.040
You're like, man, I wish I could put something together that looks that good.

34:21.040 --> 34:25.600
They send you this stuff in the box, and I've gotten so many clothes like this.

34:25.600 --> 34:29.120
Do you know what they do is really neat if you've been a member there for a little while?

34:29.120 --> 34:35.360
They'll send you outfit suggestions based on some of the new stuff you're getting,

34:36.160 --> 34:39.520
combined with old stuff that they know that you bought already.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.920
So like old selections that they've already sent along,

34:41.920 --> 34:45.040
they'll pair with like new things, give you some new altogether outfits.

34:45.760 --> 34:46.640
It's really good.

34:46.640 --> 34:48.400
I really like the Stitch Fix.

34:49.600 --> 34:52.240
It helps make a, you know, style attainable.

34:53.120 --> 34:57.200
Even if you're like me and you don't know anything at all about anything.

34:57.200 --> 35:01.520
So you just go to Stitch Fix and you just, you're going to answer some questions about your sizes,

35:01.520 --> 35:03.520
what kind of styles you like, your budget.

35:03.520 --> 35:07.200
And then however frequently as you want these boxes to show up,

35:07.200 --> 35:11.600
your personal stylist will hand select five brand new clothing items just for you.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.760
You try them on and you only pay for what you keep.

35:13.760 --> 35:15.680
And shipping is free both ways.

35:15.680 --> 35:19.760
So go to stitchfix.com slash my brother and get started now.

35:19.760 --> 35:23.920

35:23.920 --> 35:27.360
That's stitchfix.com slash my brother.

35:27.360 --> 35:32.080
I have a message here and it is for Elowen and it's from Emmett.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.960
Emmett says, hi Smellowen.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.880
Oh, right out the gate.

35:36.880 --> 35:37.920
Well, that seems mean.

35:37.920 --> 35:38.960
We'll see how it goes.

35:38.960 --> 35:42.240
I hope hearing from the brothers is a sweet treat for your ear meat

35:42.800 --> 35:47.360
as you collect little pieces of the street, which I know you do quite often.

35:47.360 --> 35:50.640
You're my favorite human and a wonderful cat mom to Stacy,

35:50.640 --> 35:52.720
even though he's turning purple.

35:52.720 --> 35:57.360
Thanks for being a thoughtful, loving, emotionally intelligent partner.

35:57.360 --> 35:58.640
Love, a good boy.

35:58.640 --> 35:59.040
Okay.

35:59.040 --> 36:02.160
See right there at the end, got very sweet.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.520
Stacy's cat mom has got it going on.

36:05.520 --> 36:06.480
Uh-huh.

36:06.480 --> 36:07.120
All right.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.040
She got a jumbo.

36:09.040 --> 36:09.680
Oh, sorry.

36:09.680 --> 36:13.360
She got an ad on the jumbo, John.

36:13.360 --> 36:13.600
Yeah.

36:13.600 --> 36:17.360
How many times can we do this song in the year 2018?

36:18.960 --> 36:19.520
How many times?

36:19.520 --> 36:21.360
Like through five?

36:21.360 --> 36:23.760
I just want to know what the limit is before we do it.

36:23.760 --> 36:27.280
I think there's a 10 reference max in 2018.

36:29.680 --> 36:32.000
Hey, just read this next Jumbotron.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.360
It's a message for Fidel.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.320
It's from dad.

36:34.320 --> 36:37.360
It says, dear Fidel, hope you're having a great big day.

36:37.360 --> 36:40.400
May your chicken always be delicious and your gravy savory.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.680
We'll always be there to scoop you into a family sandwich

36:44.320 --> 36:47.600
or be a solid foundation that you can sit upon.

36:47.600 --> 36:51.440
My love for you is only surpassed by my love for mom.

36:51.440 --> 36:51.760
Burn.

36:53.760 --> 36:55.200
Happy birthday, Fidel.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.840
And to more adventures with Kelsey and I.

36:57.840 --> 36:58.800
Love, dad.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.480
This is all time best.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.760
First of all, it was for January.

37:01.760 --> 37:02.560
Sorry, we fucked up.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.320
But holy fucking shit.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.720
Your dad burned you to the ground, Fidel.

37:06.720 --> 37:10.320
I mean, may your gravy always be savory.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.120
The first line, y'all, hope you're having a great big day.

37:13.120 --> 37:16.560
I don't know what that means, but it's so fucking good, Fidel's dad.

37:16.560 --> 37:18.160
Scoop him into a family sandwich.

37:18.160 --> 37:18.960
Yes, please.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.480
A solid foundation you can sit upon.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.360
Oh, so nice.

37:21.360 --> 37:22.880
Also, I love your mom more than you.

37:23.600 --> 37:24.240
Awesome.

37:24.240 --> 37:24.640
I know.

37:24.640 --> 37:25.200
Awesome.

37:25.200 --> 37:25.840
Sorry, fool.

37:25.840 --> 37:26.720
Knew her longer.

37:26.720 --> 37:29.760
Anyway, that stems the breaks.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.280
Without her, there is no use.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.720
I have to like her more.

37:32.720 --> 37:34.160
I can make more use with her.

37:34.160 --> 37:35.680
So whatevs.

37:35.680 --> 37:36.480
Whatevs, dude.

37:37.840 --> 37:41.920
Here's a message for Kat, and it's from Max, who says, hello, my love.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.360
I hope all is going well for you.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.680
I mean, I should know since we live together now.

37:45.680 --> 37:49.200
These past five years just keep getting better and better.

37:50.560 --> 37:55.520
I can't wait to see what you do next, whether it's in entertainment, breath work,

37:55.520 --> 37:57.280
or something I can't even imagine.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.480
Like breath work for me.

37:59.440 --> 38:02.240
You're unbelievable and make me smile every day.

38:02.240 --> 38:03.040
I loaf you.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.600
I loaf you.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.600
I'm just going to go ahead and look at what breath work is.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.160
I think it's like when people breathe.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.080
It's like breathing therapy.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.440
Yeah, that's good stuff.

38:15.440 --> 38:15.940
Great.

38:16.560 --> 38:20.320
Yeah, I hope things are also going well for you, Kat.

38:20.320 --> 38:27.040
And maybe let's just take this moment in Kat's name to just like do a quick one,

38:27.040 --> 38:28.320
a quick long breath.

38:31.280 --> 38:32.720
It's nice to give listeners permission.

38:32.720 --> 38:33.760
You don't have to make it a joke.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.600
It doesn't have to be a joke.

38:35.600 --> 38:36.880
I learned this on Daniel Tiger.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.160
He said to do this every minute.

38:39.920 --> 38:40.720
Podcasts.

38:40.720 --> 38:41.520
Podcasts.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.240
Podcasts.

38:42.240 --> 38:46.480
There are audio programs that tell smart stories in innovative ways.

38:46.480 --> 38:51.840
Using editing techniques like this, like this, like this, like this, but let's face it,

38:51.840 --> 38:54.400
all that smart stuff can be exhausting.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.800
That's where Stop Podcasting Yourself comes in.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.240
It's so stupid.

38:58.240 --> 39:02.400
It's just two stupid dinguses being dumb idiot jerks for 90 minutes.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.800
Stop Podcasting Yourself.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.600
The stupid show that smart people love.

39:07.600 --> 39:12.400
Find it on iTunes or Maximumfun.org.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.400
What?

39:14.400 --> 39:18.400
I said, did you hear me?

39:18.400 --> 39:28.400
I've never heard, what is this confused filter you've put on your guitar?

39:28.400 --> 39:34.400
I want to munch.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.400
Squad.

39:36.400 --> 39:41.040
I want to munch.

39:41.040 --> 39:41.520
Squad.

39:44.640 --> 39:45.920
This is a short one.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.280
Just kind of got out of my skin.

39:48.240 --> 39:50.640
Chipotle to start testing bacon in September.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.440
Fuck, I guess my question about this, we're going to get into it,

39:55.440 --> 39:58.960
but where the fuck does Chipotle get off testing bacon?

40:01.360 --> 40:02.480
Don't test bacon.

40:02.480 --> 40:06.000
Well, I have two immediate thoughts about that.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.080
First, I think Chipotle should maybe focus on really sticking the landing

40:10.080 --> 40:11.840
on all their current ingredients,

40:11.840 --> 40:15.680
vis-a-vis not making it make people shit themselves to death.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.880
Like maybe lock those down.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.440
Experiment with not poisoning.

40:19.440 --> 40:28.160
Yeah, experiment with not mass poison the biggest attack on our country in decades,

40:28.160 --> 40:31.040
but also like maybe this is why they have to test the bacon out.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.600
Maybe they started doing the bacon and people started getting poisoned

40:33.600 --> 40:35.280
and they were like, I don't know, guys, maybe it's us.

40:36.240 --> 40:40.560
You know, this is the same chain that made a bunch of people butt sick,

40:40.560 --> 40:42.240
and then they're like, this is amazing.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.240
This is amazing, Chipotle.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.280
What are you going to do next?

40:45.280 --> 40:47.680
They're like, cheese sauce.

40:47.680 --> 40:48.480
Read it and weep.

40:50.720 --> 40:52.320
That's where we're at right now.

40:53.520 --> 40:57.520
Chipotle's first big menu test in CEO Brian Nichol's tenure.

40:57.520 --> 41:01.040
Brian Nichol must be a new CEO that is against poisoning people.

41:02.560 --> 41:06.480
Shane announced August 9th it's piloting two new menu items

41:06.480 --> 41:10.800
and promotions in select cities nationwide, et cetera, et cetera.

41:10.800 --> 41:15.360
The first of these efforts is Applewood smoked bacon.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.520
Chipotle said the product received a, quote,

41:19.520 --> 41:26.000
tremendous response from customers at its next kitchen in New York City.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.080
Sort of like a test kitchen, I guess, up there.

41:28.080 --> 41:28.580
Sure.

41:29.360 --> 41:34.000
This September, bacon will expand to an eight restaurant operations test

41:34.000 --> 41:39.440
in Orange County, California before being considered for a full market test.

41:40.240 --> 41:43.680
Here's what Chris Brandt, the chief marketing officer, has to say in a release.

41:45.200 --> 41:49.680
Customers have always said everything tastes better with bacon,

41:49.680 --> 41:53.360
and that's exactly what we confirmed in our New York test kitchen.

41:54.080 --> 41:55.680
No fucking shit, Chris.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.720
Yeah, dog.

41:56.720 --> 41:59.920
Also, sky is blue, sun is hot.

41:59.920 --> 42:02.960
We found customers added bacon to their traditional bowls,

42:03.520 --> 42:07.200
burritos, tacos, and nachos.

42:07.200 --> 42:09.200
Hey, Chris, if you give them a handful,

42:09.200 --> 42:11.920
they would have added it to their Diet Coke, okay?

42:12.560 --> 42:13.360
That's bacon.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.760
And also they enjoyed new items such as the BLT quesadilla

42:17.760 --> 42:21.840
with bacon, lettuce, tomato, top three ingredients.

42:21.840 --> 42:22.880
I love it at BLT.

42:23.760 --> 42:25.440
So totally craveable.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.680
And grilled and cheese grilled to perfection.

42:28.240 --> 42:32.720
Quesadillas are currently only available in the next kitchen, Chipotle added.

42:32.720 --> 42:34.720
I can't wait before you get too excited.

42:38.080 --> 42:40.160
That seems like the bigger announcement.

42:40.160 --> 42:43.840
Yeah, I know I'm talking a lot about quesadillas right now,

42:43.840 --> 42:45.680
but they are out of your reach.

42:45.680 --> 42:47.440
We don't offer them, and I'm really sorry.

42:48.480 --> 42:50.560
Right after that, they're going to go with nachos.

42:52.000 --> 42:52.400
Nice.

42:52.400 --> 42:53.360
Hey, Chipotle.

42:53.360 --> 43:00.320
Why, why are you testing these things that will work?

43:01.280 --> 43:02.960
Do you know what place has nachos?

43:04.080 --> 43:05.440
Pretty much every place.

43:05.440 --> 43:06.480
You know why?

43:06.480 --> 43:08.880
Because they're pretty good and hard to fuck up.

43:09.440 --> 43:10.960
Like, you don't need to test it.

43:10.960 --> 43:11.920
Just do it.

43:11.920 --> 43:14.400
If you want to put bacon on there, people want it.

43:14.400 --> 43:15.520
Just put bacon on there.

43:15.520 --> 43:16.560
It's fine.

43:16.560 --> 43:19.040
But they're going to have, you know,

43:19.040 --> 43:23.200
head chef Daniel Simpson at the kitchen.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.680
He's like, let's get some tortilla chips.

43:25.680 --> 43:26.800
Let's get some cheese.

43:26.800 --> 43:27.760
Let's get some meat.

43:27.760 --> 43:28.800
Let's have some lettuce.

43:28.800 --> 43:29.760
Let's have some poison.

43:29.760 --> 43:30.800
Time to put tomato.

43:30.800 --> 43:31.360
Time to-

43:31.360 --> 43:31.840
Oh, no.

43:33.760 --> 43:34.720
I did it again.

43:34.720 --> 43:39.120
Why do we keep the poison right next to the tomatoes?

43:39.120 --> 43:43.040
Here's a little sub announcement they snuck in here.

43:43.040 --> 43:53.440
Through September 20th, customers at participating Miami and Dallas locations can now get $2 tacos

43:53.440 --> 43:56.000
with the purchase of any drink after 8 p.m.

43:56.800 --> 44:00.720
These restaurants will also stay open later until 11 p.m.

44:01.600 --> 44:10.640
to, quote, satisfy demand for food experiences outside of standard business hours.

44:10.640 --> 44:13.280
Hey, does this franchise know how to party or what?

44:13.280 --> 44:20.880
They are so fucking afraid to run afoul of anybody at this point.

44:21.840 --> 44:24.960
What I love is that Taco Bell's like, what's up, doobie heads?

44:24.960 --> 44:27.280
Come eat our trash food at 4 a.m.

44:27.280 --> 44:28.400
Fuck the police.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.720
And Chipotle can't-

44:30.720 --> 44:33.840
Chipotle's your fucking RA who's like, we're up to 11.

44:33.840 --> 44:34.320
Good job.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.400
We're going to have marshmallows.

44:36.400 --> 44:43.680
You're going to have a $2 taco experience outside the normal business hours.

44:43.680 --> 44:45.840
Make sure you buy a drink.

44:45.840 --> 44:50.960
Meanwhile, Taco Bell is like robbing the Wendy's next door, like kicking in the door

44:50.960 --> 44:52.720
and stealing their money for weed.

44:52.720 --> 44:57.920
I thought we'd get a little wild tonight and maybe at 10 30 p.m.

44:57.920 --> 45:01.200
we'll put a handful of bacon on those nachos.

45:01.200 --> 45:06.720
Just something new, a little risque.

45:06.720 --> 45:09.120
Oh my, oh my.

45:09.120 --> 45:09.760
So anyway-

45:09.760 --> 45:10.480
This is a good one.

45:11.520 --> 45:14.960
I have a quick, can I ask you guys a quick question?

45:16.400 --> 45:16.880
Uh, sure.

45:16.880 --> 45:17.920
Just, uh, real quick.

45:17.920 --> 45:19.200
Travis, you look.

45:19.200 --> 45:19.440
Uh-huh.

45:20.160 --> 45:21.840
Just, uh-

45:21.840 --> 45:22.640
Just say the riddle.

45:22.640 --> 45:23.760
Just start doing the riddle.

45:23.760 --> 45:30.080
I guess I was just wondering, I'm like a dog with a tail that wags and all,

45:30.080 --> 45:31.680
but I am not a dog.

45:32.320 --> 45:33.120
What am I?

45:34.480 --> 45:36.880
Yeah, I mean, dog's the only one with tails, so shit.

45:36.880 --> 45:38.800
Ah, what am I?

45:40.160 --> 45:40.400
What?

45:41.440 --> 45:42.400
I am a puppy.

45:44.560 --> 45:46.000
That's pretty good, yeah.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.360
So like, got you.

45:47.360 --> 45:48.880
Very good, very good.

45:48.880 --> 45:49.760
That's a good riddle.

45:49.760 --> 45:50.320
Here's one.

45:50.960 --> 45:57.920
Uh, current score on this one is 490 upvotes, 1379 downvotes.

45:57.920 --> 46:01.920
What can be heard and caught, but never seen?

46:01.920 --> 46:02.880
Hmm.

46:02.880 --> 46:04.080
Hmm.

46:04.080 --> 46:07.840
What can be heard and caught, but never seen?

46:08.320 --> 46:09.280
A cold?

46:09.280 --> 46:10.400
Hmm, interesting.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.440
Griffin, do you have a guess?

46:12.480 --> 46:13.440
A butterfly?

46:13.440 --> 46:14.560
It's a remark.

46:14.560 --> 46:22.000
You can't see a remark, I guess, is one thing.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Okay.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.680
Like many spoken things, you can't see a remark.

46:27.680 --> 46:28.400
Can't see it.

46:29.360 --> 46:31.280
So like, any spoken thing, really?

46:31.280 --> 46:32.800
Pretty much anything you would say.

46:34.160 --> 46:36.720
I guess any audible thing, too.

46:36.720 --> 46:42.160
Like, yeah, like any, pretty much any audible thing, I guess.

46:42.160 --> 46:44.160
The sound of a bell, perhaps.

46:44.160 --> 46:46.480
Um, all right, I'm done.

46:46.480 --> 46:48.000
This is a new Yahoo.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.360
I'm reading Yahoo now.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.120
Okay, bring us a new Yahoo.

46:52.960 --> 46:54.720
I just have to say one more thing.

46:54.720 --> 46:58.240
I pass before the sun, yet make no shadow.

46:58.240 --> 46:58.960
What am I?

47:01.680 --> 47:02.480
The wind.

47:04.560 --> 47:06.800
I'm pretty sure that's not accurate.

47:07.360 --> 47:12.320
I have to give Phil 9 here, but I'm pretty sure none of that makes any fucking sense.

47:13.760 --> 47:16.240
All right, S. Kirby sent this one in.

47:16.240 --> 47:16.720
Thank you.

47:16.720 --> 47:22.320
It's Yahoo Answers user Megan who asks, and maybe this is a riddle.

47:22.320 --> 47:26.000
Which soda stains car seats the worst?

47:27.440 --> 47:30.960
The car seats are light gray, and I want to mess them up.

47:32.960 --> 47:34.720
This is not to avoid.

47:34.720 --> 47:35.360
This is-

47:35.360 --> 47:35.860
Oh!

47:36.720 --> 47:38.240
I see.

47:38.240 --> 47:41.440
Yeah, I want to mess these gray seats up with some soda.

47:41.440 --> 47:44.720
So how do I stain these bad boys up with the most stain worthy soda?

47:44.720 --> 47:45.920
Hawaiian punch?

47:45.920 --> 47:46.720
Do they still-

47:46.720 --> 47:48.640
Can you get Hawaiian punch in a drive-thru?

47:49.360 --> 47:51.120
I mean, maybe, but it's not a soda.

47:51.120 --> 47:54.720
And the fact that it was ever available in that context is wild.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.800
Frankly, then it's Mountain Dew Code Red.

47:56.800 --> 47:59.280
You think Mountain Dew Code Red is highly stainable?

48:00.320 --> 48:05.360
Well, it's got the dye in it, because it's not a natural red, friend.

48:05.360 --> 48:06.320
It's a good point.

48:06.320 --> 48:11.520
If you use like a brown, that could almost look distressed.

48:11.520 --> 48:17.040
If the person had like a talented hand in the cleaning up of it, it could just look like character.

48:17.040 --> 48:23.760
Whereas like Hawaiian punch definitely is going to look like red, just red.

48:23.760 --> 48:24.240
Very obvious.

48:24.240 --> 48:26.000
But the brown could also look like dookie.

48:26.000 --> 48:26.560
And that's it.

48:26.560 --> 48:27.040
What's up?

48:27.040 --> 48:29.680
We got to talk about what's the worst stain.

48:30.240 --> 48:37.760
Because if they make sort of an opaque white soda that you can put all over the seat,

48:37.760 --> 48:39.760
I think you know where I'm going with this one.

48:39.760 --> 48:40.260
Come.

48:43.760 --> 48:44.800
Do you know what I mean?

48:44.800 --> 48:51.120
And if they make an opaque white soda, and I'm thinking about it, what this would be,

48:51.120 --> 48:51.600
and you spill this-

48:51.600 --> 48:52.160
Like squirt.

48:54.400 --> 48:58.240
Yeah, squirt might work, and you spill this all over the back seat, but like a huge amount,

48:58.240 --> 49:02.800
then it's going to look like a truly just epic amount of jizz.

49:05.680 --> 49:08.160
I would say squirt is probably going to stain the most.

49:08.160 --> 49:12.000
Unavailable in any context.

49:12.640 --> 49:13.440
That's also fair.

49:13.440 --> 49:14.800
Here's what I would suggest.

49:14.800 --> 49:15.520
Can you read the question again?

49:15.520 --> 49:17.520
Are we going through a drive-through in this one?

49:17.520 --> 49:18.960
Which soda stains car seat?

49:18.960 --> 49:19.600
Nah, baby.

49:20.720 --> 49:21.840
World's our oyster.

49:21.840 --> 49:26.400
It sounds like this is maybe some kind of fun prank or terrible prank on an enemy.

49:26.960 --> 49:31.920
I would say way more disturbing to me is if you found a way to just-

49:31.920 --> 49:33.200
One, also let me tell you this.

49:33.200 --> 49:36.800
Don't Google squirt to try to find out what color squirt is.

49:36.800 --> 49:37.200
Bad.

49:37.200 --> 49:37.840
Bad, bad, bad.

49:37.840 --> 49:38.400
Bad, bad, bad.

49:38.400 --> 49:39.920
It's not a good word on the internet.

49:39.920 --> 49:40.480
Yeah.

49:40.480 --> 49:41.680
Just the word squirt?

49:41.680 --> 49:44.560
Just the word squirt.

49:44.560 --> 49:50.560
But what I will say is if I periodically went out to my car to find that not only was there

49:50.560 --> 49:55.920
a spill in my car, but a spill that stayed wet no matter how much I dried it or how long

49:55.920 --> 49:58.160
it sat there, that would bother me the most.

49:58.160 --> 50:03.360
So you're going to have to like just repeatedly pour soda on the seat until the person gets

50:03.360 --> 50:04.400
rid of the car.

50:04.400 --> 50:06.400
I just, we got to take a brief aside.

50:07.040 --> 50:08.800
Because if you Google the word squirt-

50:08.800 --> 50:11.520
Griffin, I told you not to.

50:11.520 --> 50:12.160
No, I did.

50:13.360 --> 50:16.960
It is mostly pornography on the front page.

50:16.960 --> 50:22.240
And it's like, what if a child is looking for a new super soaker, but they get anxious

50:22.240 --> 50:25.280
and they get overeager and they don't fill out the whole phrase.

50:25.280 --> 50:26.000
And they do that.

50:26.560 --> 50:28.800
Has the word squirt really just sort of-

50:28.800 --> 50:29.360
It's gone.

50:29.360 --> 50:30.720
Has the word squirt is just-

50:31.440 --> 50:32.400
It's gone away.

50:32.400 --> 50:35.040
I've never really seen a word go before.

50:35.040 --> 50:40.000
Whoever is like the PR manager for squirt, whoever's supposed to be getting the word

50:40.000 --> 50:46.400
out needs to do some brand management online to try to get that higher up on those search

50:46.400 --> 50:46.560
results.

50:46.560 --> 50:51.360
The weird thing about it is though, and this is very rare, I think in language, but if

50:51.360 --> 50:55.120
you add gun, it gets a lot more kid friendly.

50:56.320 --> 50:59.200
I don't know how many things you can say that about, honestly.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.320
Squirt soda is not even on the first page of results.

51:02.320 --> 51:02.880
It's not.

51:02.880 --> 51:06.720
Yeah, no, it's all, all, all, all, all of it, all of it, all of it.

51:06.720 --> 51:12.960
Coke black has not existed since OTT5 or OTT6, but that has to be-

51:12.960 --> 51:14.320
It's up there.

51:14.320 --> 51:20.880
Through history, one of the most highly staining sodas because it is like half coffee, half

51:20.880 --> 51:21.280
Coke.

51:22.560 --> 51:25.600
Should I buy an empty bottle of it on eBay?

51:25.600 --> 51:27.440
The shrink wrap is like-

51:28.240 --> 51:28.960
It's empty?

51:28.960 --> 51:29.520
It's empty?

51:29.520 --> 51:32.560
Yeah, but the shrink wrap, it's like, it looks really nice.

51:34.240 --> 51:34.560
No.

51:34.560 --> 51:35.040
No.

51:35.040 --> 51:35.680
$12.99.

51:35.680 --> 51:36.960
Yeah, but-

51:36.960 --> 51:37.200
No.

51:37.200 --> 51:39.280
Yeah, no, that's not a good thing to put money on.

51:39.280 --> 51:40.320
Yeah, no, that's a good point.

51:40.320 --> 51:43.680
I just wish it was full of Coke black because I love some of that wonderful stuff.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.160
Coke black would probably stain a lot.

51:46.160 --> 51:49.360
I feel like full sugar root beer would be very bad.

51:50.480 --> 51:52.080
I'll tell you what's going to really get us there.

51:52.080 --> 51:56.640
You know, Jones soda, they don't abide by the fucking laws that the rest of the soda

51:56.640 --> 51:57.280
companies have.

51:57.280 --> 52:01.600
You know, Jones soda has like a cummy soda for sure.

52:01.600 --> 52:07.440
Why is it even so narrowly focused?

52:07.440 --> 52:08.400
It's just the wildest-

52:08.400 --> 52:13.040
It's really, it's just amazing to me how Griffin is quickly going back and forth between judging

52:13.040 --> 52:17.680
the internet for taking the word squirt, but also is obsessed with finding the cummiest

52:17.680 --> 52:18.240
soda.

52:18.240 --> 52:21.360
It's just the, it's the wildest stain, isn't it?

52:22.960 --> 52:23.440
Orbits?

52:24.000 --> 52:24.640
Orbits.

52:24.640 --> 52:26.000
Orbits would be good.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.280
It's got chunks.

52:27.280 --> 52:28.880
It's got chunks right in it.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.880
Are there any sodas that you would be happy?

52:35.200 --> 52:37.840
I think if someone spilled crystal Pepsi-

52:37.840 --> 52:40.400
Well, cause they have it, then they would have some.

52:40.400 --> 52:42.240
Yeah, then I could have some of it.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.200
But it's back.

52:43.200 --> 52:44.560
It's back in effect.

52:45.520 --> 52:50.240
Do they make a soda where if I spill the cummy Jones soda in the back seat and get the funny

52:50.240 --> 52:54.000
stain back there, but it lowers the resale value of my car.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.680
And then if I spill, is there another soda I can spill on it that'll clean it up?

52:58.080 --> 53:00.080
Like one that has like some-

53:00.880 --> 53:01.920
Oh, I see what you're saying.

53:02.400 --> 53:02.960
Yeah, it'll-

53:02.960 --> 53:04.000
Club soda.

53:04.000 --> 53:09.040
Like an oxy-clean soda, which again, Jones soda might make.

53:09.040 --> 53:11.440
Those guys are fucking out of their gourds.

53:11.440 --> 53:14.720
I do have to say again, club soda, please do not add us.

53:14.720 --> 53:15.440
Okay, thank you.

53:16.400 --> 53:16.880
Club soda.

53:16.880 --> 53:18.400
You remove stains with club soda.

53:18.400 --> 53:21.280
It's not funny, but it's a thing that I think people would have said to us on Twitter.

53:21.280 --> 53:21.760
No, you're right.

53:21.760 --> 53:22.320
You're right.

53:22.320 --> 53:22.880
You're right.

53:22.880 --> 53:24.400
You're right.

53:24.400 --> 53:27.360
I don't think it's going to be power enough to get rid of all these cummy stains.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.160
They're pretty deep in there.

53:30.720 --> 53:31.520
Let's see.

53:31.520 --> 53:34.080
Just like a Jackson Pollock painting back there.

53:34.080 --> 53:35.040
Yeah, great.

53:35.040 --> 53:36.880
Ah, fully so good.

53:36.880 --> 53:42.400
Folks, we've so appreciated your patronage here at my brother, my brother, me farms.

53:42.400 --> 53:44.000
We hope you enjoyed yourself.

53:45.680 --> 53:50.960
And we hope that you're taking care of yourself and everybody around you that is within your

53:50.960 --> 53:52.480
power to take care of.

53:52.480 --> 53:56.240
You want to go see Schmaners at the London Pod Festival?

53:56.800 --> 53:57.360
You can.

53:58.160 --> 53:59.280
That's going to be happening.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.680
That's a great picture, Trav.

54:01.680 --> 54:03.040
Hey, thank you.

54:03.040 --> 54:04.000
Who did that picture?

54:05.440 --> 54:06.960
I don't remember off the top of my head.

54:06.960 --> 54:07.440
It's great.

54:08.320 --> 54:08.640
Thank you.

54:08.640 --> 54:12.000
You can get tickets for that at bit.ly slash schmanerslondon.

54:12.000 --> 54:12.240
Yeah.

54:12.880 --> 54:16.000
And there's also a Cush show happening next month.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.120
Bit.ly forward slash Cush September.

54:19.120 --> 54:21.040
That was the sound of three S's.

54:21.040 --> 54:24.480
Yeah, Cush September 2018.

54:24.480 --> 54:25.200
Who's going to be at that?

54:26.320 --> 54:29.040
Well, I can't tell you because that's the whole thing, but I can tell you it is

54:30.480 --> 54:31.760
maybe my favorite lineup so far.

54:31.760 --> 54:32.720
Don't do that.

54:32.720 --> 54:34.320
It's going to make people feel inferior.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.640
Well, it's really great.

54:36.640 --> 54:38.720
It's one of my favorite lineups of all time.

54:38.720 --> 54:39.520
All right, great.

54:39.520 --> 54:41.920
I launched a new podcast last week.

54:42.720 --> 54:49.200
It's called Positivatini and it's messages of hope, inspiration, and joy in 10 minutes

54:49.200 --> 54:49.680
or less.

54:49.680 --> 54:55.760
It's me and Amy Dallen and Erika Ishii and it's just like, you know, short episodes

54:55.760 --> 55:01.360
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to start the day off with some like positive energy.

55:01.360 --> 55:03.040
Positivatini.

55:03.040 --> 55:05.760
T-E-E-T-E-N-Y.

55:05.760 --> 55:06.640
Yeah, it's teeny.

55:06.640 --> 55:07.840
It's a teeny positive show.

55:08.400 --> 55:09.040
No, I'm sorry.

55:09.040 --> 55:12.080
I stepped on a thumbtack and that's why I made that noise.

55:12.080 --> 55:20.800
Also, at the New York Comic Con shows, I could tell you who's going to be there now because

56:37.120 --> 56:39.200

56:39.200 --> 56:41.440
It is so choice.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.400
Ten out of ten.

56:42.400 --> 56:45.840
And I also want to thank MaxFun for having us on the network, MaximumFun.org.

57:05.840 --> 57:14.880
Aris, who asks, is it true that some vegetarian won't even drive through a city if it has

57:14.880 --> 57:15.920
the word ham in it?

57:17.680 --> 57:19.120
My name is Justin McElroy.

57:19.760 --> 57:21.040
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:21.040 --> 57:22.160

Comedy and culture.

57:45.280 --> 57:46.400
Artist owned.

Listener supported.

57:47.680 --> 57:49.280
It's new promo time, James.

57:49.840 --> 57:51.280
What you got in that guy?

57:51.280 --> 57:56.240
How about this, you need more black friends, Minority Corner, every Friday.

57:56.240 --> 58:01.280
Uh, okay, but girl, that doesn't say anything about how we're a podcast that talks about

58:01.280 --> 58:04.400
queer issues, race, politics, and pop culture.

58:04.400 --> 58:07.040
Now it does because I've already hit record.

58:07.040 --> 58:10.400
Oh girl, you so sneaky, you be Linda Trippin' me.

All from a perspective that's black, queer, and ladylike.

58:15.920 --> 58:18.240
Because nobody puts minorities in the corner.

58:18.240 --> 58:21.680
Every Friday.
