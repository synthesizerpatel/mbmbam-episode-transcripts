00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:46.960
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother,

00:46.960 --> 00:51.520
mean advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:51.520 --> 00:55.280
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

00:55.280 --> 00:56.880
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.880 --> 01:06.080
Oh, there's a turkey in the studio.

01:06.080 --> 01:08.720
Oh man, not again, oh not again.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.880
Could one of our producers come in here and get it?

01:15.520 --> 01:16.640
Yeah, if you could get the turkey.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.160
Any one of you?

01:18.160 --> 01:21.680
Someone come get the turkey, the turkey has now soiled my coffee.

01:21.680 --> 01:26.480
Dillip, could you come get it, or Susman?

01:26.480 --> 01:27.520
Don't touch it like that.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.600
Susman, show Dillip how to touch it right.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.120
Oh God, Susman, no.

01:34.480 --> 01:38.640
Boy, I wish we hadn't pardoned, boy howdy,

01:38.640 --> 01:41.120
I wish we hadn't pardoned this turkey for all its crimes.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.400
To be fair, most of its crimes were white collar,

01:45.440 --> 01:49.920
and it has used its skills to help solve other crimes.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.760
As everyone knows, we may need a little bit of setup here

01:53.760 --> 01:54.960
if you don't follow the news.

01:54.960 --> 01:58.720
And perhaps, and I'll say it, it's most ill-advised policy.

01:59.360 --> 02:02.320
This administration has decided that all pardoned turkeys

02:02.880 --> 02:06.080
must live with us, or any other podcaster.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.400
Our name got pulled out of the hat.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.640
Of course, everybody knows about Stinky Fred,

02:12.640 --> 02:14.560
the turkey that lives at the Joe Rogan Show.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.640
And I'm just hoping, what podcaster do you guys hope

02:18.640 --> 02:20.640
gets a turkey next year?

02:20.640 --> 02:23.280
I kinda would like to see Mark Maron interview a turkey.

02:24.320 --> 02:26.320
He already did, if you ask me, Gallagher.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.960
Guys, that's one real turkey.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.720
Is there a Maron episode with Gallagher?

02:31.360 --> 02:33.920
Oh, there's a famous Gallagher Maron episode, Travis.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.520
Get with the fucking net, dude.

02:37.360 --> 02:41.040
I am up to here in turkey shit,

02:41.680 --> 02:44.800
and ready for the holiday to be over.

02:44.800 --> 02:45.920
For those of you who can't see,

02:45.920 --> 02:48.160
Griffin just pointed to the bottom of his shoe.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.440
It's not really that dramatic.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.000
Nah, I'm swimming in it.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.600
In the fiction that we've crafted,

02:53.600 --> 02:54.800
whose house is the turkey at?

02:56.160 --> 02:58.240
I think that in this world, in the fiction we've created,

02:58.240 --> 03:00.240
we were all in the same studio living together.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.360
In like a full house kind of scenario.

03:03.360 --> 03:07.360
As so many television producers who we have floated the idea

03:07.360 --> 03:09.680
of making a My Brother, My Brother, Me television show

03:09.680 --> 03:13.840
have suggested, we all live together in one swinging pad.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.200
One of us is married.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.680
One of us is in a long-term relationship.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.440
One of us is a swinging single.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.000
Also, there's like four dozen fucking turkeys in here.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.440
Yeah, and here's the twist that makes this really special

03:25.440 --> 03:28.080
and why I think this is coming this fall to NBC

03:28.080 --> 03:31.120
is that one of us is a coyote.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.440
And that makes things so funny and a little bit sexy

03:36.000 --> 03:37.760
with all of the fucking turkeys.

03:37.760 --> 03:41.200
And all the turkeys are like paying tenants, right?

03:41.200 --> 03:44.000
So like, we can't eat them, right?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.120
But we want to.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.680
And also, thank you Justin for not giving away

03:47.680 --> 03:49.120
because one of us is a turkey,

03:49.120 --> 03:51.520
but you don't find out which one until like season three.

03:52.160 --> 03:52.560
Yeah.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.520
Well, that's interesting

03:53.520 --> 03:55.760
because Justin actually said one of us is a coyote,

03:55.760 --> 03:57.680
but the idea that one of us is a turkey

03:57.680 --> 03:59.280
is also very powerful, Travis.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.840
And I'm going to bring this up to Ryan,

04:01.840 --> 04:03.840
who's the showrunner on this one.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.080
Oh, we got Ryan.

04:06.080 --> 04:06.320
Ryan Reynolds.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.360
We got Ryan.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.120
No, it's just Ryan.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.000
Oh.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.440
Yeah, he's the exotic Norwegian television showrunner.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.760
He made fucking cheers.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.320
But anyway, this is Turkey House coming this.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.400
And this has been the pilot to Turkey House.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.160
Turkey House, one coyote.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.280
This is Turkey House.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.680
This is Turkey House.

04:27.680 --> 04:28.800
And I hope you guys liked it.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.560
And this was the intro for this funny episode

04:30.560 --> 04:31.920
of my brother, my brother and me.

04:31.920 --> 04:32.880
It was a funny introduction.

04:32.880 --> 04:36.400
Turkey House, colon, one coyote is the second season.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.240
We're doing it like Terrace House.

04:38.240 --> 04:38.720
Yes.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.920
With like, you know, boy, ex-girl in the city.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.440
That kind of deal is one coyote.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.880
And then season three is Turkey House, colon, too many eggs.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.000
Yep.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.640
Next one is Turkey House boys versus girls in the city.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.600
This one, we're drawing a line down the middle of the house

04:55.600 --> 04:57.440
and we're putting some fucking catapults in there.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.360
So this is an advice show.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.960
Catapult, more like birdapult.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.160
That's one of the jokes that happens.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.680
That's one of the many jokes that we have

05:03.680 --> 05:05.520
in season four of Turkey House.

05:05.520 --> 05:09.120
That was supposed to be saved for the trailer for season five.

05:09.120 --> 05:13.280
I'm sorry, everyone forget, forget I said it.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.320
Wow, Travis.

05:14.320 --> 05:14.800
Wow.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.760
We've got nothing.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.240
So I'm going to go back to the joke board for season five

05:18.240 --> 05:19.280
and I'm erasing that one.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.160
And now it's blank.

05:21.760 --> 05:23.600
Yeah, there's no more jokes on the board.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.440
A bird in my hand, more like a hundred birds in my hand.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.520
If it makes you feel any better, Justin,

05:29.520 --> 05:30.960
the joke board for this episode of my brother,

05:30.960 --> 05:32.400
my brother and me, as far as I can tell,

05:32.400 --> 05:34.640
was Griffin makes a turkey noise

05:34.640 --> 05:36.320
and then we just kind of, everything else

05:36.960 --> 05:40.080
was just that one little twisted brand of magic that we-

05:40.080 --> 05:42.320
Griffin, you were making that turkey noise?

05:42.320 --> 05:43.520
You kidding me?

05:43.520 --> 05:45.120
I thought you had a turkey with you.

05:45.760 --> 05:46.800
What a betrayal.

05:46.800 --> 05:47.680
Okay, okay, okay.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.000
I was making it with my throat

05:50.000 --> 05:52.480
because I am the one who was-

05:52.480 --> 05:53.680
You're the turkey.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.440
Please, God, we got to start doing the podcast.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.240
This is it, Griffin, this is the podcast.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.680
Betrayal, we're in it.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.600
This one's getting a little long in the gobbler.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.840
So if we could just swing right on one-

06:05.840 --> 06:07.760
That is how we finish season five,

06:07.760 --> 06:10.160
the final season of Turkey House.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.720
This one's getting long in the gobbler.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.760
So that's the last line of dialogue.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.480
Class dismissed, and then we flip off the light.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.520
Class dismissed, I love, I do love class dismissed.

06:19.520 --> 06:23.680
Every show should, at the end, every show,

06:23.680 --> 06:26.000
the last episode of Law & Order should be like,

06:26.720 --> 06:28.000
one of the cops is like,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.400
anyway, criminals, we caught all of you.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.440
We got all of you.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.520
Class dismissed, turn off the lights.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.920
Yeah, shit.

06:37.520 --> 06:41.120
I have a rare condition called laughter-induced syncope,

06:41.120 --> 06:42.720
which is a fancy way of saying,

06:42.720 --> 06:44.480
I faint when I laugh too hard.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.400
All the studies I've read say

06:46.400 --> 06:48.160
the best way to treat situational fainting

06:48.160 --> 06:50.160
is to stop doing the thing that causes it.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.560
I'm not gonna stop laughing, so my question is this,

06:52.560 --> 06:54.320
how do I tell my new friends they don't have to worry

06:54.320 --> 06:56.480
when I suddenly lose consciousness during a fit of laughter?

06:56.480 --> 06:58.320
That's from fainting goat girl.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.760
Sunglasses, big, loose suit,

07:03.040 --> 07:06.720
weakened at Bernie's, is this anything?

07:06.720 --> 07:07.760
Huh, huh.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.240
Is this any, I'm partying with my new friend,

07:10.800 --> 07:14.240
they start cracking up so hard that they faint,

07:14.240 --> 07:16.320
but they're wearing a big sort of Blues Brothers suit,

07:16.320 --> 07:17.600
and they're wearing sunglasses.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.920
I look at them, and I think, hell yeah,

07:19.920 --> 07:22.000
that must be a cool thing that people are doing now,

07:22.000 --> 07:25.920
is just sort of a surprise siesta situation.

07:25.920 --> 07:29.040
And maybe have a friend with you who, when you do this,

07:29.040 --> 07:31.040
say, they're processing it, right?

07:31.040 --> 07:34.320
And it makes it seem like, wow, not only do they enjoy my joke,

07:34.320 --> 07:36.160
they're really taking it in.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.880
They're really appreciating my contribution

07:38.880 --> 07:40.160
to the conversation.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.040
Hey, what was up with what just happened to you?

07:43.040 --> 07:44.960
Oh man, your joke was so fucking dope

07:44.960 --> 07:47.120
that I had to dream about it right now.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.560
Sometimes I hear jokes that are so funny and so cool,

07:50.560 --> 07:52.800
I think, I'd like to play with that in the dream space.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.720
And so I go immediately to sleep right there,

07:54.720 --> 07:56.080
and right then and there.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.600
Here's, I've never, I don't think I've ever done this

07:59.600 --> 08:03.040
on a show before, but I am going to offer my services here

08:03.040 --> 08:04.560
to the question asker.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.920
Here's what's gonna happen.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.600
I'll travel around with you,

08:07.600 --> 08:09.520
and when someone makes a really funny joke,

08:09.520 --> 08:11.600
and you feel yourself starting to laugh too hard,

08:11.600 --> 08:14.240
I'll then make a joke of my own making

08:14.240 --> 08:16.400
to level you out back down to the middle.

08:16.400 --> 08:21.040
Travis is the comedy chill out tent, essentially.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.520
I'll make a joke that you go, I mean, conceptually,

08:23.520 --> 08:24.800
that's funny.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.160
Yeah, it's kind of a thinker, huh?

08:26.160 --> 08:28.240
I guess that's, yeah, that's funny in a way,

08:28.240 --> 08:29.840
it has the structure of a joke.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.920
If Justin and I are bringing the acid,

08:31.920 --> 08:34.000
Travis swings back in with the base,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.120
just to keep your pH as close to zero as possible.

08:37.120 --> 08:40.160
Yes, and I'm willing to do that for you,

08:40.160 --> 08:42.400
I guess for the rest of your life.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.240
I guess that's what I'm offering here.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.760
Let me tell you something about friends.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.560
Okay, oh, everybody, wait, hold on, give me a second,

08:50.560 --> 08:51.360
let me get in place.

08:51.360 --> 08:54.240
I'm ready to laugh about Ross and Chandler, please go.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.760
Joss, Roey,

08:55.760 --> 08:59.040
Pandler, Chibi.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.280
Those are my new set of friends.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.560
No, let me tell you something about friends.

09:02.560 --> 09:07.600
A true friend will still worry about you

09:07.600 --> 09:09.920
even if they know why you fainted.

09:09.920 --> 09:10.720
Yes.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.320
I still think there should be concern,

09:12.320 --> 09:14.160
I think concern is fair.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.960
You were standing over a big pile of broken dishes,

09:16.960 --> 09:18.720
you know, when you were laughing so hard.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.240
When you were laughing so hard.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.040
Other unsafe things,

09:25.040 --> 09:26.960
come on, play with me in this space.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.080
Yes.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.440
You know, unsafe stuff.

09:29.440 --> 09:30.800
Yeah, the bus saw factory.

09:30.800 --> 09:31.640
Yeah.

09:31.640 --> 09:32.480
Bus, thank you, bus saw factory.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.880
You were working on a girder, building a tall tower.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.320
Yeah, and it was lunch break,

09:37.320 --> 09:40.360
you were having a big 1920s sandwich.

09:40.360 --> 09:44.280
Oh yeah, and a big old thermos of coffee

09:44.280 --> 09:46.200
with your sandwich, I guess.

09:46.200 --> 09:49.720
Having a big stogie, looking out at the 1920s

09:49.720 --> 09:51.320
New York City skyline.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.120
One of your friends tells an off-color joke,

09:54.120 --> 09:56.120
it's the 1920s, so probably about,

09:56.120 --> 09:58.000
I don't know, Eisenhower.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.960
Woo, off you go, I'm concerned.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.000
Your real friends are always gonna worry about you

10:03.000 --> 10:05.720
when you faint, and that's fine, that's healthy.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.000
I think that's normal.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.400
Has this never happened to you guys?

10:09.400 --> 10:11.160
Laughing so hard that you fainted?

10:11.160 --> 10:12.200
Yeah.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.040
No.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.400
No, I don't think so.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.240
Okay, this has happened to me.

10:17.240 --> 10:18.760
Well, but Justin, you have a tendency

10:18.760 --> 10:21.520
to get a fit of the giggles, in a way that

10:21.520 --> 10:23.240
Griffin and I don't really.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.260
I titter like a polite little mouse,

10:25.260 --> 10:28.040
but Justin, you rip and roar like a big,

10:28.040 --> 10:29.720
I don't know, like a monster truck.

10:29.720 --> 10:32.700
Yeah, you start going, and I've seen the tears

10:32.700 --> 10:36.000
flow from your eyes, the color rise to your face,

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
I've seen you near death from enjoying

10:39.000 --> 10:41.160
a joke I have made so much.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.440
I would love a super cut of all the times

10:43.440 --> 10:45.500
that we've gotten noises out of you on this show

10:45.500 --> 10:47.520
that are more like, bleh!

10:47.520 --> 10:50.160
Like, do you, like, let's like,

10:50.160 --> 10:53.040
Trav, hey Trav, do a laugh for me, like one of us.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.200
Okay, and when I do it, I'm like.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.300
But sometimes, Justin, when you do it,

10:56.300 --> 10:57.140
you're like, bleh!

10:58.960 --> 11:00.000
Is that what it's like?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.240
Yeah, wow. Sometimes that.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.400
And it doesn't start like that, but you get there,

11:03.400 --> 11:05.320
and that's probably, so if I guess.

11:05.320 --> 11:07.000
You know how Dennis Nedry sounds

11:07.000 --> 11:09.560
when he gets hit in the face with the spittle?

11:09.560 --> 11:11.920
Oh, this is a good, yeah, please, go on.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.640
It's like you were laughing at that noise that he made.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.200
Justin, don't take this as us slamming you,

11:17.200 --> 11:19.400
or dunking you, or burning you, or razzing you,

11:19.400 --> 11:21.400
or zapping you, or anything like that.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.080
I'm saying you would pass out less

11:24.080 --> 11:26.840
if you opened the glottis a little bit.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.440
Or if you just didn't enjoy things anymore.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.160
That, no, stop it.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.280
I want Justin to have a joy-filled life.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.560
I'm just saying, when you have a laugh in there,

11:35.560 --> 11:38.360
don't squish it down and give it a, bleh!

11:38.360 --> 11:41.960
Open the glottis, and just, ah, and let it out.

11:41.960 --> 11:42.800
Yeah.

11:43.880 --> 11:44.960
Speaking of.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.640
Oh, let's hear you try it.

11:46.640 --> 11:47.880
Pry open that glottis, and let them.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.680
Do something fucking funny.

11:49.680 --> 11:50.520
Farts.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.720
Here's what, now, let me see if this makes me,

11:53.720 --> 11:54.800
I came up with a joke.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.000
Okay. So, let me say it,

11:57.000 --> 11:58.640
and see if I laugh hard enough.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.260
Okay. To where, okay.

12:02.520 --> 12:03.860
Bernie Man?

12:03.860 --> 12:06.000
It's like Bernie Man, but with Bernie Sanders.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.800
Is that anything?

12:07.800 --> 12:10.240
Bleh! Oh, God.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.080
Shit, actually, I kind of get it now, Juice.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.680
That feels good as hell.

12:13.680 --> 12:17.140
It's like I'm a laugh crockpot.

12:17.140 --> 12:19.320
It's like I'm a giggle pressure cooker,

12:19.320 --> 12:21.560
and I keep it down there, and I feel it more.

12:21.560 --> 12:23.160
I feel the happiness more.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.360
I'm glad I could help.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.280
Do you guys want to, how about a Yahoo?

12:26.280 --> 12:27.200
Yes, please. Yeah.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.200
Tessa sent this in.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.500
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Colin, who asks.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.200
Hey, thanks, Tessa.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.880
I'm thankful for you.

12:33.880 --> 12:38.120
Can a principal have a paper that says

12:38.120 --> 12:40.240
list of student I don't like?

12:41.200 --> 12:43.120
Oh, definitely.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.720
Yeah, for sure.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.200
I was supposed to interview the principal at my school,

12:48.200 --> 12:50.360
and I walked into her office before she did,

12:50.360 --> 12:52.560
and I saw a paper that said that,

12:52.560 --> 12:54.440
and it had a list of freshmen, sophomores,

12:54.440 --> 12:55.560
juniors, and seniors.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.920
Right as she walked in, she hurried up and took the list,

12:57.920 --> 12:59.480
and hid it in her desk.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.760
I'm surprised this teacher needs a list,

13:02.760 --> 13:05.720
because my list of people I don't like

13:05.720 --> 13:08.840
is kind of always at the forefront of my brain,

13:08.840 --> 13:10.600
just sort of cooking there.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.600
I'm shocked that this person is having

13:12.600 --> 13:14.440
such trouble keeping track.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.920
If I may, perhaps they misread this,

13:16.920 --> 13:19.320
the question asker misread the situation,

13:19.320 --> 13:24.000
and that was the weekly list turned in by each teacher

13:24.000 --> 13:26.840
to the principal, so they could keep a catalog

13:26.840 --> 13:30.480
of just the worst little shits in the school.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.280
It's like, hey, we're all gonna get together,

13:32.280 --> 13:34.720
in the teacher's lounge, and compare notes

13:34.720 --> 13:36.360
about what students we don't like,

13:36.360 --> 13:38.880
who we're gonna give detention to or fail,

13:38.880 --> 13:43.160
just cause the ones who, I don't know,

13:43.160 --> 13:45.040
maybe we'll hide something in their desk,

13:45.040 --> 13:46.320
and then yell at them for it.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.000
You know how teachers are.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.200
Like chattering teeth.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.400
Yeah.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.680
These freaking millennials that show up

13:51.680 --> 13:53.280
with their chattering teeth,

13:53.280 --> 13:55.280
causing a ruckus in my classroom.

13:55.280 --> 13:58.600
Yeah, you get it, with their joy buzzers,

13:58.600 --> 14:01.440
and I don't know, their sticky hands

14:01.440 --> 14:04.080
that they use to whip across the room

14:04.080 --> 14:06.440
to collect things from one another.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.960
Oh, I hate those.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.520
Their wax lips.

14:10.520 --> 14:11.680
Yes.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.160
Oh.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.000
You know what I don't like?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.920
You know what I don't like?

14:15.920 --> 14:16.740
What, Travis?

14:16.740 --> 14:17.960
I don't like their troll dolls,

14:17.960 --> 14:18.800
with their tall hair.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.800
Okay, thank you.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.720
And their little weird belly buttons.

14:21.720 --> 14:22.560
Oh.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.800
They stick it in Jeff's nose,

14:23.800 --> 14:25.560
and then he gets into a sneezing fit,

14:25.560 --> 14:26.800
and I'm trying to talk about algebra.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.060
They won't stop tickling Jeff's nose with the troll dolls.

14:29.060 --> 14:29.900
Yes.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.040
I'm going to confiscate every one of them

14:31.040 --> 14:32.520
and burn them in a big pile.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.880
Another big problem is that millennial baby names

14:35.880 --> 14:37.340
are pretty wild now,

14:37.340 --> 14:39.560
and so maybe it's tough to member those.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.800
Yeah, like Diplo.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.120
Diplo is a big popular one.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.540
Skrillex.

14:45.540 --> 14:49.680
Jandice is a huge one now.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.520
Suisman.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.600
Nedry.

14:51.600 --> 14:55.920
John Jirndi is huge.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.360
Travis.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.520
If you guys were teachers,

14:58.520 --> 14:59.880
what subject would you teach?

14:59.880 --> 15:01.040
This is a fun question.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.360
Drama.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.080
Driver's Ed.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.200
Which means also coaching.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.440
Oh, yeah.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.440
I would be Driver's Ed.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.760
I would go at it backwards,

15:14.760 --> 15:17.360
how most of the time they let the coach do Driver's Ed.

15:17.360 --> 15:19.040
They would bring me in for Driver's Ed,

15:19.040 --> 15:20.040
because of how good I was,

15:20.040 --> 15:22.200
but then I would have to do coaching.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.960
What would you coach?

15:23.960 --> 15:25.460
You know.

15:25.460 --> 15:26.520
I don't.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.720
Skateboarding.

15:27.720 --> 15:28.560
Nice.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.360
Uh-huh, a skateboarding coach.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.640
I'd probably coach e-sports.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.480
They say those who can't do teach,

15:34.480 --> 15:37.760
so that would be actually a really good gig for you,

15:37.760 --> 15:39.440
Griffin, with a skateboarding coach.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.400
Yeah, it's easy.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.240
Get up there.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.060
Jump.

15:42.060 --> 15:43.000
No, not like that.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.440
I'll push you.

15:44.440 --> 15:45.280
Let me push you.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.120
I'll push you.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.600
Now make the board go up with you when you jump.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.680
No, not like that.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.960
Not, I would show you, but that's too easy.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.920
You need to find, everybody's got their own style.

15:53.920 --> 15:54.920
You fell over again?

15:54.920 --> 15:56.260
Don't do that.

15:56.260 --> 15:57.500
I'm gonna pull out this row of bleachers.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.480
Just make the thing go up with you

15:59.480 --> 16:00.920
and you grind all the way down it.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.080
No, not like that.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.120
Oh my God.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.880
Now do a Chrysler 360.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.320
Why are you having so much, F, F.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.600
F's across the board.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.220
All right, Justin, what would you teach?

16:13.220 --> 16:14.440
How am I?

16:14.440 --> 16:15.800
Okay.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.040
If I don't have any more, just like cooking.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.360
You know what they need in school?

16:20.360 --> 16:24.000
Just like basic life skills.

16:24.000 --> 16:24.880
Sure.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.360
I would get, you know what my class would be

16:27.360 --> 16:29.120
called the real shit.

16:29.120 --> 16:29.960
Yeah.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.360
What it'd be is called the real shit

16:31.360 --> 16:34.280
and I would tell your students how it really is.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.440
I would teach, this is a class that I wish

16:36.440 --> 16:38.480
they had been taught to me when I was in.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.400
Pirating media.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.240
Yeah, that would be another one.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.400
That's a good one.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.560
In high school, I wish that, this is a class

16:43.560 --> 16:46.600
I would teach of the importance of opening mail.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.000
Cause you know, sometimes you get the mail

16:48.000 --> 16:49.560
and you're like, I'll open this later.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.080
And then you open it like three weeks later

16:51.080 --> 16:52.440
and you're like, oh, that was an important letter.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.880
I'm gonna get yelled at, right?

16:53.880 --> 16:54.960
And you think as an adult,

16:54.960 --> 16:57.160
you would just open the mail when it comes.

16:57.160 --> 17:00.560
But I feel like somebody didn't teach me that.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.400
And maybe I could go back and teach them

17:03.400 --> 17:07.080
the importance of opening mail in a timely fashion.

17:07.080 --> 17:08.920
That would be a short class.

17:08.920 --> 17:12.440
You think that, but do it, just as in big letters.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.560
Juice, I think you'd be a good cooking teacher

17:14.560 --> 17:15.560
for cooking class.

17:15.560 --> 17:20.560
However, the worst school fight I ever saw in my life

17:20.960 --> 17:23.240
was in my high school cooking class.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.080
You're kidding.

17:24.080 --> 17:29.080
It was a, it was like a five person, like co-ed,

17:30.080 --> 17:33.480
just real hullabaloo, a real hooskow.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.640
So like, what do you do?

17:34.640 --> 17:36.520
You're teaching about how to make, you know,

17:36.520 --> 17:37.920
taco salad or whatever.

17:37.920 --> 17:38.760
Yeah, definitely.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.560
What happens when that, when the hooskow breaks out?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.360
Here, Griffin and I worked it out.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.200
Okay, okay.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.020
Okay, you ready?

17:45.020 --> 17:45.860
Yeah.

17:45.860 --> 17:46.880
Hey, those are my tomatoes.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.440
Those are actually my tomatoes.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.280
I mean, let's hit each other a lot.

17:50.280 --> 17:51.460
With tomatoes?

17:52.500 --> 17:53.340
Okay.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.180
I'm already hitting you.

17:54.180 --> 17:55.000
I hit you in the face and in the neck.

17:55.000 --> 17:55.840
I'm hitting you back,

17:55.840 --> 17:57.180
but I'm hitting you the best and hardest.

17:57.180 --> 17:59.640
Justin, imagine I hit him in the neck and in the torso.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.920
I hit him in the gonads.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.760
He hit me in the gonads and I fell down over,

18:03.760 --> 18:06.400
right in my, right in my orbs.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.640
Oh God, he's hitting me in both butt cheeks,

18:08.640 --> 18:09.480
like bongos.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.720
Punching both butt cheeks, I have one, two fists.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.840
I'm just pounding them, pounding, pounding, pounding.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.520
It's okay to squeeze one.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.600
Oh no, one of my butt cheeks popped.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.720
I popped one of his fake cheeks.

18:19.720 --> 18:22.120
Oh no, it was actually real.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.960
I don't know how this has happened.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.240
Oh God.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.840
Teacher, teacher, I made the butt cheeks come out.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.680
Oh, it's right down to the bone.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.920
Teacher, teacher, I see his bones.

18:31.920 --> 18:32.760
Oh no.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.440
Oh, my butt is sliding down my leg.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.440
Oh God, it's in my knee.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.280
Hey, do you guys want to see some new Fortnite dances

18:40.280 --> 18:41.580
I've been coming up with?

18:42.800 --> 18:43.640
He's dancing on my broken butt.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.520
Have you stopped the fight to unite the class?

18:46.520 --> 18:48.760
Is this a different student?

18:48.760 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.560
Who's trying to unite the class?

18:51.560 --> 18:52.400
Hey, hey, hey.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.240
And they're disliked of him.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.480
Guys, guys, cut it out.

18:54.480 --> 18:57.040
This one's called the silly tornado.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.160
Oh, now you're punching my butt.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.600
I guess you didn't like it.

19:00.600 --> 19:04.000
No more butts punched.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I would just do, I mean,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.960
I have a pretty good teaching style.

19:08.960 --> 19:11.060
Because it seems like you just ignored it

19:11.060 --> 19:12.760
to talk about blueberries.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.420
No, I just let you fight it out.

19:14.420 --> 19:17.320
See, if I catch you fighting in class,

19:17.320 --> 19:19.240
I'm gonna make you fight a whole pack of them.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.000
So you love fighting.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.040
It's the cigarette thing, but more.

19:24.040 --> 19:27.000
So if you like fighting one person so much,

19:27.000 --> 19:28.680
I'm gonna make you fight a whole pack of students.

19:28.680 --> 19:29.500
Cool.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.340
Okay?

19:30.340 --> 19:32.280
So you'll fight a big, big group the next time.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.480
Okay, wait, can I try this now?

19:33.480 --> 19:34.840
I want to see what my teaching style is

19:34.840 --> 19:37.160
and you two fight and I'll see if I can break it up.

19:37.160 --> 19:41.040
Hey, Grimbo, I really hate your guts.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.160
Oh yeah, kiss my nunchucks.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.500
Hey, you two.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.000
What's this really about?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.340
I'm proud of you and I support you.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.080
Okay, let's team up.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.600
Let's team up on this nerd teacher.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.920
I'm gonna kick his nunchucks.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.040
Oh, they're punching me in the butt.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.200
Oh no, my butt.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.800
Now Griffin and I are the teachers.

19:58.800 --> 19:59.640
Okay.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.160
And Travis, you fight yourself.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.240
Okay.

20:02.240 --> 20:03.960
So don't listen to what this guy says.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.080
He always lies.

20:05.080 --> 20:07.320
I'm the real history teacher, not him.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.960
I'm punching myself in the butt so hard.

20:08.960 --> 20:09.960
He just came in here.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.040
I know he looks exactly like me

20:12.040 --> 20:13.960
because he copied my skin and my face.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.360
Copied my skin and my face.

20:15.360 --> 20:16.400
I'm the real history teacher.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.600
I'm the real history teacher.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.080
Which one do I fight?

20:19.080 --> 20:22.600
Well, say something true about history, real teacher.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.000
Real teacher.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Go ahead, I'm waiting.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.100
Go ahead, I'm waiting.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.920
World War I was a hologram.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.360
Okay.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.840
It's my first time doing a secret Santa exchange

20:32.840 --> 20:34.560
and I got someone who I've only met once.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.560
The only thing I know about this person

20:35.560 --> 20:38.360
is that they're into feet more than the average person.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.600
Waka waka.

20:40.600 --> 20:41.680
Wait, hold on.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.080
Read the rest of the sentence, though.

20:43.080 --> 20:45.200
Their job specializes in feet.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.200
Okay.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.640
And they don't seem like the type

20:47.640 --> 20:50.380
to use standard presents, such as candles.

20:50.380 --> 20:53.440
Well, should I, no one uses the candles.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.740
That's not the point.

20:55.740 --> 20:59.120
Should I embrace the feet thing and get a goof?

20:59.120 --> 21:02.120
Or is there a special secret Santa ultimate present

21:02.120 --> 21:03.800
I can get them to impress?

21:03.800 --> 21:07.240
That's from Man I'm Not Sure in Melbourne.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.080
Okay, just real quick.

21:09.080 --> 21:13.040
I'm going to speak, is it podiatrists?

21:13.040 --> 21:15.240
Who are the feet doctors?

21:15.240 --> 21:16.300
Podiatrists.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.200
Their job specializing in feet,

21:18.200 --> 21:20.840
they probably don't like it if you describe it

21:20.840 --> 21:24.080
as like they're into feet more than the average person.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.160
Probably don't love that.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.300
Yeah.

21:27.300 --> 21:29.500
My oh me, I'm a proctologist.

21:29.500 --> 21:33.080
Let me open up this package from my friend I've met once.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.620
Well, that's a asshole.

21:35.620 --> 21:36.800
Interesting.

21:36.800 --> 21:41.160
I've never bought a candle for somebody for a secret Santa

21:41.160 --> 21:43.200
because they seem like someone

21:43.200 --> 21:46.520
who's just going to use the hell out of that candle.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.520
You do it because it's like in a fancy jar

21:49.520 --> 21:53.000
or like it's holiday themed.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.280
You can always go with like, I don't know,

21:57.280 --> 22:02.280
like a Jimmy Dean sausage specialty platter or whatever.

22:02.360 --> 22:05.920
Yes, there's a spectrum of acceptable

22:05.920 --> 22:09.280
sort of person agnostic gifts

22:09.280 --> 22:11.360
that you can get someone for the holidays.

22:11.360 --> 22:14.480
And the most base of these are, you know,

22:14.480 --> 22:16.760
the Target gift card or whatever the hell.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.220
Something that you're going to,

22:18.220 --> 22:21.580
this is something that you can have and you can use,

22:21.580 --> 22:23.080
but you do not need

22:23.080 --> 22:25.300
because I don't know you enough to know your needs.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.300
Yes.

22:26.300 --> 22:31.000
This is, I have done a lot of like white elephant,

22:31.000 --> 22:32.920
Santa, you know, secret Santa things.

22:32.920 --> 22:35.480
And let me tell you, here's the hierarchy,

22:35.480 --> 22:37.480
the spectrum of gifts.

22:37.480 --> 22:40.720
At the top is the like, I know you so well

22:40.720 --> 22:44.040
and I absolutely nailed this gift that you weren't expecting.

22:44.040 --> 22:46.680
A novelty shirt referencing an inside joke off Redbubble

22:46.680 --> 22:47.520
or some shit like that.

22:47.520 --> 22:48.640
Right, that's the best.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.160
That's easily the best.

22:50.160 --> 22:55.160
Then the next step is totally generic, but usable, right?

22:55.600 --> 22:59.800
Big tin of popcorn, candle, a gift card, right?

22:59.800 --> 23:04.200
And then at the bottom is I sort of knew you

23:04.200 --> 23:06.280
and took a stab in the dark.

23:06.280 --> 23:07.480
That's where you get a thing where

23:07.480 --> 23:10.000
not only can I not use this,

23:10.000 --> 23:11.880
I now also don't like it.

23:11.880 --> 23:15.640
So like, cool, I don't know what to do with this.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.440
I know you like dogs.

23:17.440 --> 23:22.440
Here is a picture of some dogs framed in a nice frame.

23:22.760 --> 23:25.520
That's nothing, this is nothing you've given me.

23:25.520 --> 23:28.220
You've handed me air, essentially.

23:28.220 --> 23:31.280
I was gonna search for candle that smells like feet.

23:32.800 --> 23:36.320
And as I began to Google it, there was an auto-complete.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.480
So quick auto-complete challenge.

23:38.480 --> 23:42.240
What are the top five things that people search for

23:42.240 --> 23:44.220
completing candle that smells like?

23:47.480 --> 23:48.620
I'm gonna say fart.

23:49.680 --> 23:52.440
No, no, incorrect.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.840
I'm going to say, and this may be cheating

23:54.840 --> 23:57.100
because I saw it on like my Facebook feed,

23:57.100 --> 24:00.520
like rainy cement, like wet cement, rain.

24:00.520 --> 24:01.360
No.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.620
Shit.

24:02.620 --> 24:06.120
Petrichorus is what you're looking for.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.100
Books.

24:07.100 --> 24:08.240
Uh-huh.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.080
Is weed.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.720
Yeah. Okay.

24:10.720 --> 24:11.860
Matches.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.200
I like that.

24:14.200 --> 24:15.880
I love the smell when I light it,

24:15.880 --> 24:17.440
but then that just goes away.

24:17.440 --> 24:18.760
How could I keep that going?

24:18.760 --> 24:20.840
That must be the one that just like haunts

24:20.840 --> 24:24.080
candle inventors of like, just can't get there.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.820
Then there's candle that smells like rain.

24:27.820 --> 24:31.080
And then the last one is candle that smells like gasoline.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.480
Whoa.

24:32.480 --> 24:35.160
That's a wild, that's a wild ambiance.

24:35.160 --> 24:38.180
That might, maybe that's not somebody looking to buy that.

24:38.180 --> 24:40.200
They bought one and it smells like that

24:40.200 --> 24:41.400
and they're terrified.

24:41.400 --> 24:45.700
Or possibly that Jeff Gordon searched that 50,000 times.

24:45.700 --> 24:46.540
Yeah.

24:46.540 --> 24:49.200
So much so that it shows up now as a frequently searched.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.560
What if you just put out like a new,

24:51.560 --> 24:54.000
like Yankee candle that just was labeled like,

24:54.000 --> 24:55.860
smells like candle.

24:55.860 --> 24:57.840
That would really like boggle the noodle.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.720
Oh Travis, that's so fucking wild.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.080
How does that brain work?

25:01.080 --> 25:03.400
Here comes, here comes a Justin laugh.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.240
If this doesn't get it, then what will?

25:05.240 --> 25:06.520
It smells like candle.

25:06.520 --> 25:10.160
Oh, yeah, dang.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.000
No, it wasn't bad.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.080
I mean, it wasn't bad.

25:12.080 --> 25:15.440
We need to invent, and this could be fairly lucrative.

25:15.440 --> 25:17.280
We've done this before at the magic acorn,

25:17.280 --> 25:19.580
but that was, I think we can all agree that was rude,

25:19.580 --> 25:21.840
cop out, not practical gift at all.

25:21.840 --> 25:26.840
We need something else in the popcorn bucket sort of milieu.

25:29.160 --> 25:33.500
Like a neutral gift that's just like as good as a gift card.

25:33.500 --> 25:38.020
Something like, you know, fucking paper towels.

25:38.020 --> 25:39.560
God, I'm always running out of these things,

25:39.560 --> 25:41.500
but still more of a gift than that.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.940
That, oh yeah, but that's not it, right?

25:43.940 --> 25:45.340
Because that doesn't imply,

25:45.340 --> 25:47.020
I want something that both implies

25:47.020 --> 25:48.580
I didn't know about you,

25:48.580 --> 25:52.300
but I thought about the human experience, right?

25:52.300 --> 25:54.260
Ooh, that's a good point, Trav.

25:54.260 --> 25:59.060
To quote the home wrecker in Love Actually,

25:59.060 --> 26:01.540
I don't want something I need.

26:01.540 --> 26:03.700
I want something I want.

26:03.700 --> 26:08.160
And in that one, she's talking about her boss's sex,

26:08.160 --> 26:09.860
even though he's married.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.220
What about a scarf?

26:12.540 --> 26:16.860
Again, in Love Actually, she gets him a scarf,

26:16.860 --> 26:19.420
and it's quite a, that one's thorny,

26:19.420 --> 26:20.780
because of Love Actually.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.020
That one's a little bit thornier,

26:22.020 --> 26:23.700
because she gets him a scarf.

26:23.700 --> 26:26.500
What about a laundry hamper?

26:26.500 --> 26:29.880
Not expensive, but something everyone uses,

26:29.880 --> 26:32.140
but I would never think to buy at the store.

26:33.220 --> 26:35.780
Maybe you get a laundry basket,

26:35.780 --> 26:38.340
like a really nice one with nice handles,

26:38.340 --> 26:40.540
and then you go into their house early,

26:40.540 --> 26:42.460
and you break theirs.

26:42.460 --> 26:44.500
Uh-huh. Cool.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.340
And make sure- I guess that could

26:45.340 --> 26:46.660
really work with anything, huh?

26:46.660 --> 26:47.820
That particular strap.

26:47.820 --> 26:49.480
Break it right in front of the front door,

26:49.480 --> 26:50.500
so they see it.

26:51.980 --> 26:53.700
Like, as they're leaving the house that day,

26:53.700 --> 26:56.140
like, ah, dang, wait, what's that?

26:56.140 --> 26:58.340
I got a new one, a secret Santa.

26:58.340 --> 27:00.500
What fortuitous circumstances.

27:00.500 --> 27:03.260
Put the shards of their shattered laundry hamper

27:03.260 --> 27:05.260
inside of the new laundry hamper

27:05.260 --> 27:06.420
when you give it to them.

27:06.420 --> 27:08.980
That'll really flip their fucking bean, dude.

27:08.980 --> 27:11.500
What about, oh, here's a good universal gift.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.340
Oh, he's got one.

27:12.340 --> 27:15.100
Yeah, get a big bow, and put it on their car

27:15.100 --> 27:17.820
outside in the parking lot, right?

27:17.820 --> 27:20.060
And then you pull back, and say, I got you that.

27:20.060 --> 27:21.020
This is for hunters, I'm assuming?

27:21.020 --> 27:22.020
What?

27:22.020 --> 27:23.620
This is for hunters, mainly, I'm assuming?

27:23.620 --> 27:27.180
A big bow, no, excuse me, like a ribbon bow.

27:27.180 --> 27:28.020
Got it, okay.

27:28.020 --> 27:29.900
And they're gonna look out the window and see it,

27:29.900 --> 27:31.260
and they're gonna laugh, right?

27:31.260 --> 27:33.580
Because that's funny that you did that.

27:33.580 --> 27:35.680
And that's all you're really going for, right,

27:35.680 --> 27:40.100
in this bleak existence, is one bright moment of laughter

27:40.100 --> 27:42.020
shared with a new friend.

27:42.020 --> 27:43.100
Because you were the funny friend

27:43.100 --> 27:45.820
who put a giant bow on a car they already owned.

27:45.820 --> 27:49.880
Oceans eight on blue ray.

27:49.880 --> 27:50.980
Thank you.

27:50.980 --> 27:52.340
Finally, one of us says it.

27:52.340 --> 27:55.640
It's a great flick, not enough people saw it.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.940
Sandy's bringing all of her heat.

27:57.940 --> 28:00.020
If it had been the first one in the series,

28:00.020 --> 28:01.780
y'all would've loved it, right?

28:01.780 --> 28:04.900
I would've loved it because we would've had two more.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.540
Oceans nine and 10.

28:06.540 --> 28:07.980
We still need those, by the way.

28:07.980 --> 28:12.460
If you, please, I'm begging you, please, Hollywood,

28:12.460 --> 28:15.700
make nine and 10, or else I'm gonna do a movie marathon,

28:15.700 --> 28:17.780
I'm gonna have to sit in silence for four hours

28:17.780 --> 28:19.160
before I can start 11.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.000
Please don't do that to me.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.620
Out of respect, out of respect for these fallen films.

28:23.620 --> 28:25.860
I'm gonna have to hire local actors to act out

28:25.860 --> 28:28.980
what I think would've happened in Oceans nine and 10.

28:28.980 --> 28:31.980
And while that is good for the gig economy,

28:31.980 --> 28:35.140
it's not good for my pocketbook.

28:35.140 --> 28:38.180
Okay, how about you put a SD card,

28:38.180 --> 28:39.980
and you wrap that up, and you give it to them,

28:39.980 --> 28:40.940
and they say, what's that?

28:40.940 --> 28:43.780
And you just say, Bitcoin.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.900
Huh, but it's not?

28:47.780 --> 28:49.780
It's not Bitcoin?

28:49.780 --> 28:51.460
I mean, it's not on there.

28:51.460 --> 28:52.820
That's not how Bitcoin works.

28:52.820 --> 28:55.400
And then you can just start explaining how Bitcoin works

28:55.400 --> 28:57.880
until they've left the room.

28:57.880 --> 28:58.840
The room?

28:58.840 --> 29:01.580
How about a guest role in Oceans nine?

29:01.580 --> 29:02.980
Huh, now I feel like that only works.

29:02.980 --> 29:05.140
This only works if you're Sandra Bullock, by the way,

29:05.140 --> 29:07.180
or someone with equivalent juice.

29:08.460 --> 29:11.580
If Sandra Bullock got me in The Secret Santa

29:11.580 --> 29:14.580
and got me a candle, I mean, I feel pretty good

29:14.580 --> 29:16.220
because I got a candle from Sandra Bullock,

29:16.220 --> 29:19.020
but I'd also be like, ugh, Sandra Bullock,

29:19.020 --> 29:20.660
you don't know me better than this by now?

29:20.660 --> 29:23.180
Now, hold on just a fucking second,

29:23.180 --> 29:28.180
because I'm pretty sure old Sandy B has access to smells

29:28.260 --> 29:30.820
that you could not even fucking imagine, Travis.

29:30.820 --> 29:34.960
That's true, she can get me the match-scented candle.

29:34.960 --> 29:37.360
That's, you're thinking too small.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.080
Like, you don't know what you don't know

29:39.080 --> 29:40.740
about Hollywood smells.

29:40.740 --> 29:43.060
We haven't reached that echelon yet.

29:43.060 --> 29:45.360
Maybe when we walk that Trolls red carpet,

29:45.360 --> 29:47.660
we'll be taken into the sentitorium

29:47.660 --> 29:51.900
and granted access to the forbidden smells.

29:51.900 --> 29:55.900
But, I mean, I would love one of Sandy B's secret candles.

29:55.900 --> 29:57.800
Yeah, like, here's a candle that smells

29:57.800 --> 29:59.300
like winning an Oscar.

29:59.300 --> 30:00.140
Yeah.

30:00.140 --> 30:03.260
Hey, this question, a lot of questions we do

30:03.260 --> 30:06.420
don't have villains other than just life and how it is.

30:06.420 --> 30:08.420
This one does have a villain.

30:08.420 --> 30:11.340
It is not even Thanksgiving yet.

30:11.340 --> 30:14.580
Why is this office busybody looping people

30:14.580 --> 30:15.560
into Secret Santa?

30:15.560 --> 30:17.780
My brain isn't even there yet,

30:17.780 --> 30:20.300
and we're already having to fight about Secret Santas.

30:20.300 --> 30:22.940
You could have gotten to know this person much better.

30:22.940 --> 30:23.780
You had time.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.180
Oh, shit, you have time now.

30:26.180 --> 30:29.740
Well, that's a good point, Trav, I guess, yeah.

30:29.740 --> 30:30.560
Yeah, right?

30:30.560 --> 30:31.400
I guess that's true.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.000
Maybe this is why the office busybody,

30:33.000 --> 30:34.860
or perhaps just friend group busybody,

30:34.860 --> 30:38.220
has done this now, like, hey, you have six weeks

30:38.220 --> 30:40.820
to learn about this person,

30:40.820 --> 30:43.880
and maybe the best present you'll give them is friendship.

30:43.880 --> 30:47.680
This is what Tuesdays with Maury is about, I bet.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.760
We gotta stop saying that every episode.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.680
I know, but I'm just so fascinated by it,

30:51.680 --> 30:52.700
but I'm afraid to read it,

30:52.700 --> 30:53.920
because I think I'll be disappointed

30:53.920 --> 30:55.860
if it doesn't live up to all the predictions

30:55.860 --> 30:58.980
I've made about it over the past, you know, 500 episodes.

31:00.100 --> 31:03.400
Maybe they have put in the legwork

31:03.400 --> 31:05.360
to get to know this person,

31:05.360 --> 31:10.360
and they really are just all about that foot life.

31:10.680 --> 31:11.520
Oh.

31:11.520 --> 31:12.340
Do you know what I mean?

31:12.340 --> 31:14.000
Their house is a foot locker.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.160
Do you know what I mean?

31:15.160 --> 31:16.600
Maybe we were wrong at the beginning,

31:16.600 --> 31:18.380
when we were like, it's probably not a bit.

31:18.380 --> 31:19.820
Maybe they did put in the effort,

31:19.820 --> 31:22.700
and they're like, oh, how's it going, Dr. Stanson?

31:23.800 --> 31:25.080
Exquisite toes.

31:25.080 --> 31:27.040
Like, that's like the heat that they bring.

31:27.040 --> 31:30.080
And I'm not saying people who are into feet

31:30.080 --> 31:31.480
are all about that, but I'm saying

31:31.480 --> 31:35.480
this particular podiatrist is into it that deep.

31:35.480 --> 31:39.680
And also, to be fair, I think we maybe jumped to podiatrist,

31:39.680 --> 31:41.660
but all this is they're just specialized in feet.

31:41.660 --> 31:44.360
They might work at a foot locker.

31:44.360 --> 31:45.880
Possible, possible.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.120
If you are a podiatrist, and the question asker says

31:49.120 --> 31:51.720
they specialize in feet, that seems like

31:51.720 --> 31:53.920
a weirdly general way of putting it, right?

31:54.880 --> 31:56.840
It seems like they could have given us a bit more than that.

31:56.840 --> 31:58.480
That would have given some color, I think,

31:58.480 --> 32:00.020
that would have helped.

32:00.020 --> 32:02.840
Maybe, maybe, it's hard to say.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.640
The holidays are tough for everyone, man.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.280
It's so true.

32:07.280 --> 32:10.600
Is it possible to find, is there like a candle sommelier

32:10.600 --> 32:12.000
that you could talk to and say,

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
give me the candle that's the exact opposite of feet

32:16.000 --> 32:17.940
so that they can burn it in their office

32:17.940 --> 32:20.320
to create a neutral experience?

32:20.320 --> 32:21.160
I'd be here.

32:21.160 --> 32:24.000
Are you talking about fucking smell canceling technology,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.540
Travis, because if so, yes.

32:26.540 --> 32:28.760
Opposite candles that create

32:28.760 --> 32:32.600
the exact opposite smell waves from feet.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.100
Huff the unfoot.

32:35.960 --> 32:37.160
The unfoot.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.620
That's powerful, Trav.

32:39.620 --> 32:42.280
I think, can you get a patent for bullshit

32:42.280 --> 32:44.640
that doesn't exist but should and might?

32:44.640 --> 32:45.480
As long as that's possible.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.140
I think that's specifically what patents are for.

32:47.140 --> 32:48.240
Yes.

32:48.240 --> 32:49.080
This is mine.

32:49.080 --> 32:51.960
No, no, I, no, patents are for,

32:51.960 --> 32:53.720
I figured out a way to do things.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.040
I'm saying a patent for like,

32:56.040 --> 32:58.400
if someone ever does this, I got this,

32:58.400 --> 33:00.160
because like I thought about, oh,

33:00.160 --> 33:01.240
that it needed to happen.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.800
So we can tell a fib to Uncle Government

33:03.800 --> 33:06.360
that we invented the unsmell.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.800
Yeah, what are they gonna do, send someone over to check?

33:08.800 --> 33:09.800
Yeah, what are they gonna do?

33:09.800 --> 33:13.360
Come in and be like, oh, this doesn't pass the smell test.

33:13.360 --> 33:14.200
Mm-hmm.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.020
Mm-hmm.

33:15.020 --> 33:15.860
Mm-hmm.

33:15.860 --> 33:17.040
Mm-hmm.

33:17.040 --> 33:18.760
See, it feels good to let them out, doesn't it?

33:18.760 --> 33:19.740
It does feel good.

33:19.740 --> 33:21.360
Just rip them, baby.

33:21.360 --> 33:24.200
Hey, if I'm gonna buy some secret Santa presents,

33:24.200 --> 33:25.960
I need to go to the money zone.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.520
Oh, well, let's go then.

33:27.520 --> 33:28.360
Get on my back.

33:28.360 --> 33:29.600
Wee.

33:29.600 --> 33:30.860
Griffin, get on Travis's back.

33:30.860 --> 33:31.700
No.

33:31.700 --> 33:34.160
All right, then follow behind, like a sad song.

33:34.160 --> 33:39.160
Oh, yeah.

33:44.600 --> 33:48.480
You know what I wish I could have for Christmas just once?

33:48.480 --> 33:50.000
A good night's sleep.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.900
But I've been sleeping on this pile of hay and rocks,

33:52.900 --> 33:54.400
and I just don't know what to do.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.900
Not just like the baby Jesus.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.960
Just like the baby Jesus.

33:57.960 --> 34:01.120
Except all year round, and not just at Christmas.

34:01.120 --> 34:02.320
What do I do, fellas?

34:02.320 --> 34:03.720
Oh, jeez, Travis.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.160
Well, boy, you gotta go to Casper.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.000
Yeah.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.880
You gotta also tell us if you're gonna set us up like that,

34:08.880 --> 34:10.920
because I thought that you were driving this car,

34:10.920 --> 34:12.000
and then I looked outside,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.480
and you were like a half mile behind us,

34:14.480 --> 34:16.360
and Justin and I were in the backseat trading Pokemon.

34:16.360 --> 34:17.520
I thought Travis was driving,

34:17.520 --> 34:20.280
and Griffin and I decided to look at some of the local flora

34:20.280 --> 34:23.080
and fauna while he drove us to our destination.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.080
No, I was driving.

34:24.080 --> 34:25.720
I just needed you all to check the map

34:25.720 --> 34:27.040
to see where I was going.

34:27.040 --> 34:27.880
Okay.

34:27.880 --> 34:28.720
Oh, bud.

34:28.720 --> 34:29.540
Yeah, listen.

34:29.540 --> 34:30.380
That's a full-time gig.

34:30.380 --> 34:31.760
I can't be occupied with that.

34:31.760 --> 34:32.600
Casper's great.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.240
I'm trying to do my Sudokus back here.

34:35.240 --> 34:37.400
Casper makes the mattresses.

34:37.400 --> 34:38.240
They're so nice.

34:38.240 --> 34:39.980
We all got them.

34:39.980 --> 34:41.840
Got the in-laws in town right now.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.680
They're about to crash on our Casper.

34:43.680 --> 34:47.500
So psyched, so jealous, actually, of them.

34:48.360 --> 34:51.040
And there's products, guys.

34:51.040 --> 34:54.460
These products are cleverly designed to mimic human curves,

34:54.460 --> 34:57.680
providing supportive comfort for all kinds of bodies.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.160
And yeah, the original Casper,

35:00.160 --> 35:02.400
it combines multiple supportive memory foams

35:02.400 --> 35:04.520
for a quality sleep surface.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.380
And it's got sync, it's got bounce

35:06.380 --> 35:09.520
in just the correct sort of ratio that you want.

35:09.520 --> 35:12.080
And also, they got that 100-night risk-free sleep

35:12.080 --> 35:16.000
on it trial that it's gonna do you just right.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.040
Justin, take it over.

35:17.040 --> 35:17.880
So here's what you're gonna do.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.480
You don't wanna take our word for it.

35:19.480 --> 35:20.320
You wanna find out for yourself.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.160
We are untrustworthy.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.620
We are shady.

35:22.620 --> 35:23.560
Proven.

35:23.560 --> 35:26.120
Go to casper.com slash brother

35:26.120 --> 35:28.640
and use the code brother at checkout,

35:28.640 --> 35:31.400
and you're going to get $100 towards select mattresses

35:31.400 --> 35:33.160
by visiting casper.com slash brother

35:33.160 --> 35:35.340
and using the code brother at checkout,

35:35.340 --> 35:37.120
terms and conditions apply.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.680
There's a 100-night risk-free sleep on it trial.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.640
Just give it a whirl, casper.com slash my brother,

35:42.640 --> 35:44.680
and then use the code brother at checkout to save 100 bucks.

35:44.680 --> 35:47.680
I wanna tell you about my new service that I've invented,

35:47.680 --> 35:50.120
and it's called Blayubrin.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.720
And basically, what I do with this service

35:51.720 --> 35:54.880
is I send you already made meals,

35:54.880 --> 35:56.760
and then you're gonna take those meals

35:56.760 --> 36:00.460
and break them back down to their individual components.

36:00.460 --> 36:01.300
Like a puzzle.

36:01.300 --> 36:02.960
Yes, exactly like a puzzle,

36:02.960 --> 36:05.000
except it's like if you bought a puzzle

36:05.000 --> 36:06.720
and it was already done in the box,

36:06.720 --> 36:08.320
and then you had to take it apart.

36:08.320 --> 36:09.480
Fuck, that sounds good.

36:09.480 --> 36:12.000
I would love to smash big puzzles for a living.

36:12.000 --> 36:12.820
And here's the-

36:12.820 --> 36:13.660
It's the best part of puzzles.

36:13.660 --> 36:15.680
The best part about Blayubrin

36:15.680 --> 36:17.160
is that when you are done,

36:17.160 --> 36:20.000
you're gonna ship that on to somebody else,

36:20.000 --> 36:20.840
and then they're gonna take

36:20.840 --> 36:22.720
those individualized ingredients,

36:22.720 --> 36:24.880
they're gonna make a meal out of it.

36:24.880 --> 36:25.720
Right.

36:25.720 --> 36:26.560
Are they gonna eat it, you're asking?

36:26.560 --> 36:28.320
No, that would be disgusting at this point,

36:28.320 --> 36:30.360
because it's easily like two or three weeks old.

36:30.360 --> 36:32.540
They're gonna ship it on to the next person

36:32.540 --> 36:34.000
who's gonna break it back down to the end,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.920
and so on, and so on, and so on.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.280
And if that's fascinating, Travis,

36:38.280 --> 36:39.800
but I'm gonna give you a counter proposal.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.120
How about this?

36:41.120 --> 36:44.700
How about instead of that, whatever that was,

36:44.700 --> 36:47.060
it wasn't comedy, but whatever that was, Travis,

36:47.060 --> 36:48.920
how about instead of that,

36:48.920 --> 36:50.840
they head on over to Blue April

36:50.840 --> 36:54.120
and get ingredients delivered to them,

36:54.120 --> 36:55.200
and they can make something

36:55.200 --> 36:57.160
worth celebrating this holiday season.

36:58.320 --> 36:59.680
So they make the meal and send it,

36:59.680 --> 37:01.040
they send the meal to someone?

37:01.040 --> 37:02.040
No.

37:02.040 --> 37:04.640
No, you actually consume it on site

37:04.640 --> 37:06.900
in front of God and everybody.

37:06.900 --> 37:10.680
There is a wide array of Blue Apron recipes.

37:10.680 --> 37:13.520
They can kinda customize it to different diets.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.220
I've been going a little healthier lately.

37:15.220 --> 37:17.900
Last night, Sid made lettuce wraps

37:17.900 --> 37:20.480
with some beef and farro in it.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.840
It's delicious, it's delicious.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.500
They have wonderful meals that you can make at home.

37:25.500 --> 37:28.960
They're fun to make, and I'll say,

37:28.960 --> 37:29.860
even more fun to eat.

37:29.860 --> 37:31.180
Whoa.

37:31.180 --> 37:35.000
Maybe this season, give yourself the gift

37:35.000 --> 37:38.560
of learning how to be one of the great chefs,

37:38.560 --> 37:40.300
and I don't mean competent in the kitchen.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.240
That's what Blue Apron wants me to say.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.840
What I'm gonna say is begin your journey

37:44.840 --> 37:48.480
towards becoming the next Ratatouille chef guy.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.680
Remi, thank you.

37:51.280 --> 37:52.260
Start now.

37:52.260 --> 37:57.040
Bring the magic of the kitchen back and enjoy a home.

37:57.040 --> 38:01.960
Bring the magic back, bring back the magic of your kitchen.

38:01.960 --> 38:04.040
Hey, bring that back.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.600
Bring Magic Mike back to your kitchen

38:05.600 --> 38:08.200
and have him cook you a home-cooked meal.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.720
Check out this week's menu and get $60 off

38:10.720 --> 38:13.560
when you visit blueapron.com slash my brother.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.600
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.800
Blue Apron, cook more.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.760
We interrupt the podcast you're listening to

38:21.760 --> 38:24.280
to tell you about another podcast.

38:24.280 --> 38:26.920
That's right, we got this with Mark and Hal.

38:26.920 --> 38:28.160
That's correct, Mark.

38:28.160 --> 38:29.240
This is Hal.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.280
We do the hard work for you,

38:31.280 --> 38:33.680
settling all of the meaningless arguments

38:33.680 --> 38:35.440
you have with your friends.

38:35.440 --> 38:38.520
So tune in every week on the Maximum Fun Network

38:38.520 --> 38:40.360
for We Got This with Mark and Hal,

38:40.360 --> 38:43.480
and all your questions will be asked and answered.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.000
You're welcome.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.200
All right, that's enough of that.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.040
We got this.

38:48.680 --> 38:50.560
Can I Yahoo?

38:50.560 --> 38:51.560
Please do. Please do.

38:51.560 --> 38:52.880
This one was sent in by Ethan.

38:52.880 --> 38:53.720
Thanks, Ethan.

38:53.720 --> 38:58.720
It's a Yahoo Answers user, oh geez, I Am Male, who asks,

39:00.640 --> 39:02.800
before Tarzan learned about humans,

39:03.680 --> 39:05.640
why is he the only one who's wearing a cloth

39:05.640 --> 39:08.080
while the rest of his gorilla families are naked?

39:09.240 --> 39:10.840
Okay.

39:10.840 --> 39:13.600
Well, I assume it's because gorillas

39:13.600 --> 39:16.800
have a natural protection for their bits,

39:16.800 --> 39:19.320
what with fur and hair and stuff,

39:19.320 --> 39:21.160
and just the way that they walk.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.920
Where humans, because we stand upright,

39:23.920 --> 39:27.280
would have that genitalia exposed and dangerous.

39:27.280 --> 39:31.000
Plus, it would really hurt when you're swinging on vines.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Counter.

39:32.000 --> 39:32.840
Okay.

39:32.840 --> 39:35.400
You don't know that Tarzan doesn't have

39:35.400 --> 39:38.280
a patch of fur down there to protect his stuff.

39:38.280 --> 39:42.200
Well, I mean, I assume he has some fur, you know what I mean?

39:42.200 --> 39:44.960
His monster bush, Trav.

39:44.960 --> 39:45.800
Yeah.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.560
Because he lives in the jungle

39:48.560 --> 39:52.120
where they don't have electric razors and shit,

39:52.120 --> 39:54.800
so he's probably got mad fur down there.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.480
But he probably uses a humorous animal tool,

39:57.480 --> 40:00.000
like on the Flintstones, where we would have,

40:00.000 --> 40:02.440
I don't know, I almost said a beaver,

40:02.440 --> 40:04.320
but that's a little too on the nose, huh?

40:04.320 --> 40:07.400
They have, and I'm thinking about this now,

40:07.400 --> 40:09.440
in Flintstones, he had some sort of weird

40:09.440 --> 40:11.200
prehistoric squirrel guy, right,

40:11.200 --> 40:14.480
who chewed off his beer when he shaved in the morning.

40:14.480 --> 40:15.320
Do you use this?

40:15.320 --> 40:17.880
Ew, wait a minute, is that real?

40:17.880 --> 40:19.840
But Travis is speaking gospel,

40:19.840 --> 40:22.360
like they had animals that occupied.

40:22.360 --> 40:24.640
Like his teeth would go like brrrr.

40:24.640 --> 40:25.880
That's not, but it says,

40:25.880 --> 40:29.960
he's eating Fred Flintstone's beer tray.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.280
He doesn't, I don't think he eats that,

40:31.280 --> 40:33.160
I think it falls harmlessly to the floor.

40:33.160 --> 40:34.960
But Justin, you're.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.760
He's getting, okay, stop.

40:36.760 --> 40:37.840
No, you haven't even let Griffin

40:37.840 --> 40:38.680
get to the heart of the question.

40:38.680 --> 40:41.480
You're in year 2019, I'm in year 3120,

40:41.480 --> 40:43.320
let me get to my shit.

40:43.320 --> 40:46.360
I'm not saying that he is eating some beard,

40:46.360 --> 40:47.200
that's what I'm saying.

40:47.200 --> 40:48.040
Yeah, but let Griffin finish,

40:48.040 --> 40:51.040
because I can see where Griffin's going.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.200
Come with me down the road, the rest of the highway,

40:53.200 --> 40:55.760
because you're 100,000 miles behind me.

40:55.760 --> 41:00.760
He trims the beard, you know he's doing bushwork as well.

41:03.160 --> 41:07.680
Unless they have a separate, nastier, prehistoric squirrel

41:10.320 --> 41:12.680
that gets in there for the edge work.

41:12.680 --> 41:13.920
It's not possible.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.840
It's not efficient, it's not cost efficient,

41:16.840 --> 41:18.040
it's wasteful.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.360
Hey, Fred, can we talk?

41:19.360 --> 41:21.960
It's me, your shaving squirrel.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.960
This is no longer a living.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.720
I've been talking with.

41:26.720 --> 41:27.920
What are you talking about?

41:27.920 --> 41:29.720
It's a symbiotic relationship.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.040
It's not though, because I don't eat the pubes,

41:32.040 --> 41:34.600
I don't need the pubes to live.

41:34.600 --> 41:35.440
I've been talking with.

41:35.440 --> 41:36.720
I need your face hair to live.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.800
Yes, I've been talking with the mammoth

41:38.800 --> 41:40.400
that you use to wash your dishes,

41:40.400 --> 41:41.760
and I've been talking with the pterodactyl

41:41.760 --> 41:42.960
you use to play your records.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.520
And we've decided to unionize, Fred,

41:45.520 --> 41:48.400
and basically the one point, the one point

41:48.400 --> 41:51.040
we all agree on is none of us wanna eat your pubes.

41:52.400 --> 41:54.320
Can you imagine the squirrels all sitting around

41:54.320 --> 41:55.480
and one squirrel's like,

41:55.480 --> 41:57.600
I think you know the worst part about people?

41:57.600 --> 41:59.560
It's when they make you eat their bush.

42:00.560 --> 42:03.960
And then all the other squirrels just fall completely silent.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.160
Jeremy, what did you just say?

42:08.160 --> 42:11.640
Yeah, you know, when they make you eat their bush.

42:11.640 --> 42:12.480
Shut up.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.560
That doesn't happen.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.000
No, that's nothing.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.640
It's nothing, okay.

42:19.640 --> 42:22.480
We agree that's nothing, but can we also agree

42:22.480 --> 42:26.320
it's pretty whack that Tarzan reached a certain age

42:26.320 --> 42:28.440
and his gorilla family is like,

42:28.440 --> 42:31.360
you gotta cover that thing up, son.

42:31.360 --> 42:32.360
That's weird.

42:32.360 --> 42:34.840
What is going on there?

42:34.840 --> 42:36.960
Cover that shit up, dude.

42:36.960 --> 42:39.920
I can see your whole penis, dude, cover it.

42:39.920 --> 42:42.480
Look at Grog's, right, now look at yours.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.520
Now look at yours, it's different, isn't it?

42:44.520 --> 42:46.320
Cover yours up, Tarzan.

42:46.320 --> 42:49.600
It's so different, I can see your whole boobus.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.440
That would be a completely different Tarzan experience

42:52.440 --> 42:55.840
if like Jane and like the whole party was there

42:55.840 --> 42:59.320
and Tarzan just walked in sans loincloth

42:59.320 --> 43:00.560
and everyone's just like, oh God.

43:00.560 --> 43:01.880
And they're just like looking at the sky

43:01.880 --> 43:03.160
as he's like, aye, Tarzan.

43:03.160 --> 43:05.360
They're like, yes, yes we are aware.

43:05.360 --> 43:10.360
Your whole business is just there, Tarzan.

43:12.240 --> 43:13.880
Tarzan's business?

43:13.880 --> 43:17.920
And then you have to explain, I don't know, modesty?

43:17.920 --> 43:22.920
He like steals a top hat from the wealthy benefactor

43:23.320 --> 43:25.280
of this expedition and puts it on his head

43:25.280 --> 43:28.360
and he does a little dance with the Rosie O'Donnell gorilla.

43:28.360 --> 43:31.520
But the whole time the mini driver character's like,

43:31.520 --> 43:36.520
dude, dude, bud, it's out your thing, please.

43:39.320 --> 43:41.600
How often do you think animals in nature

43:41.600 --> 43:43.760
are out like running around or whatever

43:43.760 --> 43:45.160
and just thinking like,

43:45.160 --> 43:47.440
man, I wish we could cover this stuff up?

43:47.440 --> 43:51.000
I would love to have pants right now, it's cool.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
And I'll tell you why,

43:52.000 --> 43:55.240
it's because I just ran over some reeds

43:55.240 --> 43:57.800
and I got nipped a few times by him

43:57.800 --> 44:00.800
and I wish I had some sort of shell or protection

44:00.800 --> 44:02.240
like the turtle has.

44:02.240 --> 44:07.040
It's also like cold, man, I wish I had clothes on.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.520
Oh boy.

44:08.520 --> 44:09.360
All right.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.280
I could have done another 15 minutes

44:13.280 --> 44:14.640
on animals in Australia.

44:14.640 --> 44:15.480
Yeah, sure.

44:15.480 --> 44:18.120
I want to munch.

44:18.120 --> 44:18.960
Squad.

44:18.960 --> 44:19.800
Squad.

44:21.360 --> 44:23.120
I want to munch.

44:23.120 --> 44:23.960
Squad.

44:23.960 --> 44:28.120
Squad.

44:28.120 --> 44:32.600
I've been hearing from a lot of my Canadian friends

44:32.600 --> 44:35.320
about Christmas pizza.

44:35.320 --> 44:39.840
Now Christmas pizza is a product of Boston pizza,

44:39.840 --> 44:43.920
which is owned of course by Dragons Den,

44:43.920 --> 44:47.200
stalwart Jim TreLiving, used to be a mountain.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.800
That always sounds like you're saying Jim for a living.

44:49.800 --> 44:50.640
Go on.

44:50.640 --> 44:52.320
Nope, it's Jim TreLiving.

44:52.320 --> 44:57.320
Yeah, he owns Mr. Lube, owns Boston Pizza, huge success.

44:59.800 --> 45:04.800
And Boston pizza is going hard this year.

45:05.280 --> 45:08.760
They are going hard because it is the holiday season

45:08.760 --> 45:12.560
and they are bringing you a caroling pizza box.

45:12.560 --> 45:13.400
Huh.

45:13.400 --> 45:14.240
Huh.

45:14.240 --> 45:17.560
Now this isn't gonna seem that wild, but we'll get to it.

45:17.560 --> 45:22.080
So the pizza box, when you open it,

45:22.080 --> 45:25.080
it will play the song Carol of the Bells.

45:25.080 --> 45:27.560
How, oh, how?

45:27.560 --> 45:30.200
So you open it and I'm assuming they're,

45:30.200 --> 45:33.200
you know, we perfected this technology with greeting cards.

45:34.400 --> 45:36.240
You just open it and then it'll play

45:36.240 --> 45:37.700
Carol of the Bells, right?

45:39.600 --> 45:43.720
Boston Pizza's Niels Van Ooyen, a senior marketing manager,

45:43.720 --> 45:45.760
says that many of its pizza recipes

45:45.760 --> 45:47.360
are unexpected and creative,

45:47.360 --> 45:49.800
so it wanted creative assets to match.

45:49.800 --> 45:54.800
He says that a caroling box is a continuing expression

45:55.000 --> 45:57.440
of the brand's unique point of view.

45:57.440 --> 46:01.140
Oh, that's a long sentence that means nothing.

46:01.140 --> 46:02.600
Here's our point of view.

46:02.600 --> 46:04.200
What if the box sank?

46:04.200 --> 46:08.200
Now, boys, why are they making a caroling pizza box?

46:08.200 --> 46:09.020
You might ask.

46:09.020 --> 46:11.600
Well, for one, they're seeing takeout and delivery

46:11.600 --> 46:13.280
become increasingly irrelevant.

46:13.280 --> 46:16.600
Boston Pizza's classically sort of a sit down chain

46:16.600 --> 46:20.560
where you can enjoy a nice poutine pizza with your family,

46:20.560 --> 46:23.720
but right now, they're providing something very special

46:23.720 --> 46:25.000
and it's the Christmas pizza.

46:25.000 --> 46:25.840
Huh.

46:28.040 --> 46:31.880
Imagine a pizza that you love, okay?

46:31.880 --> 46:33.240
Imagine it with all your favorite toppings.

46:33.240 --> 46:34.800
Oh, yeah, okay.

46:34.800 --> 46:39.800
Okay, now get a rake and scrape all of those off, okay?

46:40.720 --> 46:42.400
So the good toppings are off, right?

46:42.400 --> 46:43.280
Yeah.

46:43.280 --> 46:44.720
So now we're gonna scoop on

46:44.720 --> 46:47.380
their seasoned rotisserie turkey.

46:47.380 --> 46:48.220
Okay.

46:48.220 --> 46:49.800
A house-made stuffing.

46:49.800 --> 46:50.640
Okay.

46:50.640 --> 46:52.560
Rosemary sage cream sauce.

46:52.560 --> 46:53.400
Oh, okay.

46:53.400 --> 46:55.040
And Italian cheeses.

46:55.040 --> 46:55.960
Okay.

46:55.960 --> 47:00.320
And then we're gonna ladle on some warm turkey gravy.

47:00.320 --> 47:01.360
Oh, boy.

47:01.360 --> 47:03.720
Some warm turkey gravy.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.680
And right in the middle, a huge dollop of cranberry sauce.

47:06.680 --> 47:07.620
Oh, boy.

47:07.620 --> 47:12.620
Oh, and when you buy it, you get a free Toblerone with it.

47:15.620 --> 47:16.460
Okay, okay.

47:16.460 --> 47:17.300
That's not on it.

47:17.300 --> 47:19.420
The whole time, I was like, this sounds dope as hell,

47:19.420 --> 47:21.580
waiting for the goof to kick in.

47:21.580 --> 47:23.940
It's receiving a free Toblerone at the end

47:23.940 --> 47:26.960
that really takes it over the top for me for some reason.

47:26.960 --> 47:28.900
You get a free Toblerone.

47:28.900 --> 47:29.740
I would.

47:29.740 --> 47:30.740
With this delicious pizza.

47:30.740 --> 47:31.580
Here's what I would be afraid of.

47:31.580 --> 47:34.520
Now, we are, of course, forewarned,

47:34.520 --> 47:37.480
but if I was somebody who just ordered a pizza

47:37.480 --> 47:39.780
from them and it came and I opened the box,

47:39.780 --> 47:42.340
and upon opening, the box began making

47:42.340 --> 47:45.540
any kind of noise at all whatsoever,

47:45.540 --> 47:47.660
I would drop it on the ground.

47:47.660 --> 47:49.820
Like, I would throw it across the room,

47:49.820 --> 47:52.100
assuming, I don't know, there's a swarm of bees

47:52.100 --> 47:53.280
or something inside.

47:54.400 --> 47:55.500
Is there bees inside?

47:57.580 --> 47:59.220
Sorry, I'm reading down here a little bit.

47:59.220 --> 48:01.100
There are bees inside.

48:01.100 --> 48:03.180
Just to let you know how wild this place gets,

48:03.180 --> 48:05.680
they also have cranberry barbecue ribs.

48:05.680 --> 48:08.180
I don't understand this restaurant at all.

48:08.180 --> 48:10.580
Well, we ordered a shitload of cranberries.

48:11.820 --> 48:12.660
We just got them.

48:12.660 --> 48:14.460
We gotta put them on everything.

48:14.460 --> 48:17.740
The box sings to you and it's got Thanksgiving inside it.

48:17.740 --> 48:18.580
Yeah.

48:20.580 --> 48:23.060
This is one of the best things you've ever brought,

48:23.060 --> 48:24.760
I would say, Justin.

48:24.760 --> 48:26.800
Hey, if you guys can be quiet for 30 seconds,

48:26.800 --> 48:28.980
I wanna play you an ad for it.

48:28.980 --> 48:30.740
That's right.

48:30.740 --> 48:32.420
Munch Squad AV, here we go.

48:32.420 --> 48:36.380
Christmas pizza, Boston pizza,

48:36.380 --> 48:38.340
this is an ad for a pizza.

48:38.340 --> 48:40.300
Cranberry sauce, gravy on toast,

48:40.300 --> 48:42.260
turkey as well, and also cheese.

48:42.260 --> 48:43.220
Why is there cheese?

48:43.220 --> 48:44.180
Cause we love cheese.

48:44.180 --> 48:46.380
Turkey and cheese, four kinds of cheese.

48:48.100 --> 48:49.740
Come try our Christmas pizza,

48:49.740 --> 48:52.020
this commercial's for Boston pizza.

48:52.020 --> 48:53.900
It's a turkey dinner on a pizza,

48:53.900 --> 48:55.900
pizza underneath the turkey dinner.

48:55.900 --> 48:57.820
Christmas pizza, free topper room,

48:57.820 --> 48:59.740
with a pizza, get it today.

48:59.740 --> 49:03.340
Boston pizza, the gather round.

49:03.340 --> 49:04.180
Free topper room.

49:04.180 --> 49:05.580
That's what they're.

49:05.580 --> 49:08.300
Free topper room in the pizza,

49:08.300 --> 49:12.020
but not on the pizza, don't get it twisted.

49:12.020 --> 49:16.260
It will certainly melt in the delivery process, guaranteed.

49:16.260 --> 49:18.420
I really appreciate that you did that, Justin,

49:18.420 --> 49:20.520
because it did answer my one qualm

49:20.520 --> 49:22.860
with this incredible Thanksgiving pizza,

49:22.860 --> 49:26.260
which is that they still went ahead

49:26.260 --> 49:28.300
and put some fucking cheese on it.

49:28.300 --> 49:29.140
It's not-

49:29.140 --> 49:30.180
They did put cheese on it.

49:30.180 --> 49:31.540
The rest of it, whatever,

49:31.540 --> 49:34.900
cranberry stuffing, mama's broccoli salad,

49:34.900 --> 49:36.700
whatever, go nuts on it,

49:36.700 --> 49:39.620
and it's Thanksgiving on some crust.

49:39.620 --> 49:40.460
I'm into that.

49:40.460 --> 49:43.220
But then they actually also melted some cheese all over it,

49:43.220 --> 49:44.900
and that commercial kindly explains,

49:44.900 --> 49:46.140
well, we like cheese.

49:46.140 --> 49:46.980
Yeah.

49:46.980 --> 49:47.820
Okay, Boston pizza.

49:47.820 --> 49:48.940
Hey, because we had cheese,

49:48.940 --> 49:49.780
and so they should have said-

49:49.780 --> 49:50.620
Hey, gym for a living.

49:50.620 --> 49:51.460
We have it with a bucket load.

49:51.460 --> 49:55.160
Gym for a living, could you step in to R&D real quick?

49:55.160 --> 49:59.980
So, wait, hold on, let me do my fucking gym for a living.

49:59.980 --> 50:00.940
Yeah?

50:00.940 --> 50:02.020
Well, we did what you asked,

50:02.020 --> 50:04.460
and we put a whole fucking Thanksgiving dinner

50:04.460 --> 50:06.300
on a Christmas pizza for some reason.

50:06.300 --> 50:07.220
Oh, that's great.

50:07.220 --> 50:08.380
Oh, that is great.

50:08.380 --> 50:09.220
The problem is-

50:09.220 --> 50:10.780
I love the sound of this pizza.

50:10.780 --> 50:13.660
Well, there's nothing to hold it off.

50:13.660 --> 50:16.860
It's just a bunch of wet, goopy ingredients

50:16.860 --> 50:19.820
kind of piled onto a flat surface.

50:19.820 --> 50:21.380
It's just going everywhere.

50:21.380 --> 50:22.220
So-

50:22.220 --> 50:23.940
Well, let me think about my assets.

50:23.940 --> 50:25.660
I got Mr. The Lube, does that help?

50:25.660 --> 50:27.340
No, I would say that just,

50:27.340 --> 50:30.160
that would make it more goopy, I would argue.

50:30.160 --> 50:32.580
Okay, I also own Boston Pizza,

50:32.580 --> 50:35.060
the restaurant that we're standing in right now.

50:35.060 --> 50:36.980
And you know what we got at Boston Pizza?

50:36.980 --> 50:37.820
Pizza?

50:38.940 --> 50:41.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:41.140 --> 50:42.220
I'll let you get there,

50:42.220 --> 50:43.580
because that's going to be real satisfying.

50:43.580 --> 50:45.540
Singing boxes, I don't know, Jim.

50:45.540 --> 50:46.860
You had us working on that too.

50:46.860 --> 50:48.780
Can't we just make regular pizza with like-

50:48.780 --> 50:49.620
Cheese!

50:49.620 --> 50:52.460
Cheese!

50:52.460 --> 50:54.220
It's just that I didn't get my chocolate and pizza.

50:54.220 --> 50:56.820
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

50:56.820 --> 50:58.460
God damn it.

50:58.460 --> 51:01.060
These rocket boots were supposed to kick off

51:01.060 --> 51:02.100
whenever I said cheese,

51:02.100 --> 51:04.020
and I was going to blast out the ceiling.

51:04.020 --> 51:05.420
God damn it.

51:05.420 --> 51:07.180
All right, hold on one second.

51:07.180 --> 51:08.020
Fuck.

51:08.940 --> 51:10.500
Let me try again, hold on.

51:10.500 --> 51:12.060
Cheese!

51:12.060 --> 51:13.300
Oh God, he exploded.

51:14.820 --> 51:16.220
Am I still here?

51:16.220 --> 51:17.540
No, you're on fire.

51:17.540 --> 51:19.860
Oh damn it, hold on, let me get this out.

51:19.860 --> 51:22.660
He's melting the cheese on the pizza.

51:22.660 --> 51:24.460
It's perfect.

51:24.460 --> 51:26.060
It was all part of my plan.

51:26.060 --> 51:27.980
Anyway, I'm glad I could help.

51:27.980 --> 51:28.980
Cheese!

51:28.980 --> 51:29.940
Okay, now it's working.

51:29.940 --> 51:30.780
God damn it.

51:30.780 --> 51:31.620
Now it worked that time.

51:31.620 --> 51:33.020
Ah, shit.

51:33.020 --> 51:34.660
Hey, how about another question?

51:36.340 --> 51:38.340
Yeah, do you have a question about what just happened?

51:38.340 --> 51:39.780
I don't have any questions for all I just have,

51:39.780 --> 51:40.620
it makes perfect sense to me.

51:40.620 --> 51:42.420
It all tracked to me.

51:42.420 --> 51:44.780
I'm going to need to travel for work this week.

51:45.660 --> 51:47.460
And I said I was thinking of driving myself.

51:47.460 --> 51:48.860
While my co-worker's thinking of flying

51:48.860 --> 51:49.860
or taking the train.

51:51.460 --> 51:53.420
Man, it's a boring start.

51:53.420 --> 51:54.780
Let's hang in there though.

51:54.780 --> 51:56.980
Together so far, it's pretty boring.

51:56.980 --> 51:58.260
I don't see what's boring, the rest of the question is,

51:58.260 --> 51:59.620
and if we leave at the same time

51:59.620 --> 52:01.180
and I'm going 60 miles an hour.

52:02.580 --> 52:04.580
Right, yeah, all right.

52:05.980 --> 52:07.980
Sorry, let me find my place here.

52:09.580 --> 52:11.500
A co-worker who I absolutely can't stand

52:11.500 --> 52:14.620
said it would be cost effective if I took someone with me.

52:14.620 --> 52:16.180
Pointing to himself.

52:16.180 --> 52:17.660
Yeah, we got it.

52:17.660 --> 52:20.580
I think I responded kind of non-committally.

52:20.580 --> 52:21.980
How the fuck do I shut this down

52:21.980 --> 52:24.740
so I don't have an aneurysm during a three hour drive

52:24.740 --> 52:26.780
with this completely inseparable person?

52:30.060 --> 52:32.260
This is tough because it is more cost efficient.

52:32.260 --> 52:34.060
Yeah, it is.

52:34.060 --> 52:36.900
That's true, it's much more cost efficient.

52:39.020 --> 52:40.500
You could tell them your car's cursed

52:40.500 --> 52:42.820
and anytime you drive with someone, they die.

52:42.820 --> 52:47.460
Okay, but that's gonna be tough to believe, I worry.

52:47.460 --> 52:49.740
Yeah, but I would also argue

52:49.740 --> 52:52.780
if this inseparable person isn't also completely dense,

52:52.780 --> 52:54.100
they're gonna read between the lines

52:54.100 --> 52:56.940
and get that you don't wanna ride with them.

52:56.940 --> 52:57.860
Do you think that?

52:57.860 --> 53:00.020
Because I find that people,

53:00.020 --> 53:02.260
one of the things that they lack,

53:02.260 --> 53:05.740
people who are tough to kind of hang out with a lot,

53:05.740 --> 53:07.180
one of the things that they tend to lack

53:07.180 --> 53:10.260
is sort of basic, you know?

53:10.260 --> 53:11.100
Yeah.

53:11.100 --> 53:11.940
Kind of like getting it.

53:11.940 --> 53:16.700
The stuff that we all kind of agree to without saying it.

53:16.700 --> 53:18.460
Right, yeah, just sort of like the stuff

53:18.460 --> 53:20.060
where like we all get it.

53:20.060 --> 53:21.100
Like the type of person

53:21.100 --> 53:22.420
who would invite themselves along

53:22.420 --> 53:23.940
on a three plus hour road trip

53:23.940 --> 53:27.060
with someone who they don't really get along with.

53:27.060 --> 53:30.980
Well, they don't know, see, okay, Jarv, here's the thing.

53:30.980 --> 53:32.860
They don't know they don't get along with you.

53:32.860 --> 53:34.300
This is what I'm saying.

53:34.300 --> 53:36.380
They don't have the stuff.

53:36.380 --> 53:38.020
They don't have what it takes.

53:38.020 --> 53:40.420
Okay, I'm changing my mind on this.

53:40.420 --> 53:41.940
You need to go on this road trip.

53:41.940 --> 53:43.620
It's the holiday season,

53:43.620 --> 53:47.340
and if holiday planes, trains, automobiles, I love it.

53:47.340 --> 53:51.060
What's the one with the dude from Married with Children

53:51.060 --> 53:53.660
where he goes to pick up his, I guess, new son,

53:53.660 --> 53:55.220
like stepson or something?

53:56.260 --> 53:57.420
You remember that one.

53:57.420 --> 53:58.260
It's not called, no.

53:58.260 --> 53:59.660
Sorry?

53:59.660 --> 54:01.660
Yes, with Tim Allen, Timothy Allen?

54:01.660 --> 54:02.780
No.

54:02.780 --> 54:03.860
Right, JTT?

54:03.860 --> 54:04.700
No, there's that one.

54:04.700 --> 54:05.980
JTT's in it. I'll be home for Christmas.

54:05.980 --> 54:07.860
No, on that one he goes home by himself.

54:07.860 --> 54:10.140
Yeah, that's not what I'm talking about though.

54:10.140 --> 54:11.740
I'm talking about the one with Ed O'Neil.

54:11.740 --> 54:12.580
Good flick though, good flick.

54:12.580 --> 54:14.180
Where he goes to pick up the kid

54:14.180 --> 54:16.020
and has to like drive him back to his family.

54:16.020 --> 54:17.260
You know the one.

54:17.260 --> 54:18.100
Duff.

54:18.100 --> 54:19.580
Yes, thank you.

54:19.580 --> 54:21.100
Ed O'Neil's only been in one movie.

54:21.100 --> 54:23.540
If you had just said the words Ed O'Neil,

54:23.540 --> 54:25.380
there's a chance. I said Ed O'Neil at least twice.

54:25.380 --> 54:26.220
Duff.

54:26.220 --> 54:27.060
Dutch. Good flick.

54:27.060 --> 54:28.660
It was Dutch, damn it.

54:28.660 --> 54:33.660
Dutch, Griffin, it was Dutch.

54:33.740 --> 54:34.580
Did Justin play it?

54:34.580 --> 54:35.420
It wasn't Duff.

54:35.420 --> 54:36.260
It was Dutch.

54:36.260 --> 54:37.100
Damn it.

54:37.100 --> 54:37.940
It was Dutch.

54:37.940 --> 54:40.660
Duff's my porn parody.

54:40.660 --> 54:42.660
Huh, that's a weird one.

54:42.660 --> 54:44.740
That's a weird conversion there, Justin.

54:45.940 --> 54:46.780
Okay.

54:46.780 --> 54:49.260
So anyway, do a Planes, Trains, and Automobiles with him.

54:49.260 --> 54:50.580
It was Dutch.

54:50.580 --> 54:54.100
I gotta stop doing this podcast with the two of you.

54:54.100 --> 54:57.980
The cover of the movie has him carrying the child in a bag.

54:57.980 --> 54:59.700
Wow, that is grim.

54:59.700 --> 55:00.780
Yeah.

55:00.780 --> 55:04.100
The T in Dutch in the title is just him shrugging,

55:04.100 --> 55:06.140
which says a lot about the movie to me.

55:06.140 --> 55:08.740
Ethan Embry is in it.

55:08.740 --> 55:10.660
Ethan Embry is not in my porn parody.

55:10.660 --> 55:11.940
I do not know where you heard that.

55:11.940 --> 55:13.500
I could never afford Ethan Embry.

55:13.500 --> 55:14.540
No, he's in Dutch.

55:14.540 --> 55:15.740
He plays Doyle.

55:16.820 --> 55:19.540
The two main characters in this movie

55:19.540 --> 55:22.180
are Dutch Dooley and Doyle Standish.

55:23.300 --> 55:24.300
That's rough.

55:25.660 --> 55:27.500
I say go on the road trip, I think.

55:27.500 --> 55:28.740
To get to know his girlfriend's son,

55:28.740 --> 55:30.500
a working class good guy,

55:30.500 --> 55:32.780
volunteers to pick him up from a prep school.

55:32.780 --> 55:34.260
I'm gonna play Pokemon.

55:34.260 --> 55:37.300
Only to learn that her son isn't the nicest kid.

55:37.300 --> 55:39.100
Written by John Hughes.

55:40.980 --> 55:45.980
What else about Dutch trash?

55:47.260 --> 55:48.820
JoBeth Williams is in it.

55:49.820 --> 55:50.980
Oh, huge.

55:50.980 --> 55:53.100
I'm gonna look at the trivia.

55:53.100 --> 55:56.260
Right now, I feel like how 80% of our audience feels

55:56.260 --> 55:57.860
when we discuss Frasier.

55:57.860 --> 55:59.980
I finally get it, everybody.

55:59.980 --> 56:01.260
Can we talk about Frasier real quick?

56:01.260 --> 56:02.100
Oh my God.

56:02.100 --> 56:02.940
In a meta sense,

56:02.940 --> 56:05.060
not one that requires knowledge of Frasier.

56:05.060 --> 56:09.620
People who listen to our show

56:09.620 --> 56:13.020
talk a lot about how our Frasier jokes go over their head

56:13.020 --> 56:14.100
because they never watched Frasier.

56:14.100 --> 56:15.980
I want to be kind of clear about something.

56:15.980 --> 56:19.780
We didn't watch Frasier either.

56:19.780 --> 56:21.020
We don't know.

56:21.020 --> 56:23.260
We osmose some Frasier.

56:23.260 --> 56:26.100
There's Frasier particulate in the air that we inhaled.

56:26.100 --> 56:29.380
I have watched, I would say 45 minutes of Frasier

56:29.380 --> 56:31.180
non-consecutively.

56:31.180 --> 56:33.380
Yeah, hey guys, don't sweat it.

56:33.380 --> 56:34.660
Nobody watched Frasier.

56:34.660 --> 56:35.980
Nobody watched Frasier.

56:35.980 --> 56:37.020
We all just agreed.

56:37.020 --> 56:38.540
We all allowed it to be on,

56:38.540 --> 56:41.540
but nobody actually watched Frasier.

56:41.540 --> 56:43.860
There's not some context you're missing here.

56:43.860 --> 56:44.940
It's Kelsey Grammer.

56:44.940 --> 56:45.780
He is-

56:45.780 --> 56:46.620
Fancy boys.

56:46.620 --> 56:49.260
A fancy boys, but the dad's isn't.

56:49.260 --> 56:50.820
And he has a dog and a stinky chair.

56:50.820 --> 56:52.420
That's it.

56:52.420 --> 56:54.060
End of synopsis.

56:54.060 --> 56:55.100
Should I do another question?

56:55.100 --> 56:57.580
Because I almost certainly cut about 90%

56:57.580 --> 57:00.260
of that hot Dutch material and threw it right in the-

57:00.260 --> 57:01.620
Oh, that should be the porn version.

57:01.620 --> 57:03.380
Hot Dutch.

57:03.380 --> 57:04.660
Hot Dutch material.

57:04.660 --> 57:05.500
Now, wait a minute.

57:05.500 --> 57:07.340
Travis has just opened up a cool idea,

57:07.340 --> 57:11.740
which is just like, if you want to make a pornography jaws,

57:11.740 --> 57:13.580
you would just do hot jaws.

57:13.580 --> 57:14.420
Hot jaws.

57:14.420 --> 57:16.820
Mel Gibson turned down the role of Dutch.

57:18.100 --> 57:18.940
Are you fucking-

57:18.940 --> 57:20.580
You can't pivot back around-

57:20.580 --> 57:21.420
Nothing is Dutch.

57:21.420 --> 57:22.260
Dutch is nothing.

57:22.260 --> 57:24.180
If our audience doesn't get fucking Frasier,

57:24.180 --> 57:26.300
they're not going to get Dutch, okay?

57:26.300 --> 57:28.700
None of us on this call saw Dutch.

57:28.700 --> 57:30.020
Is that agreed?

57:30.020 --> 57:30.860
Wait, hold on.

57:30.860 --> 57:32.180
Guys, this is a tasty one.

57:32.180 --> 57:33.340
This is a tasty.

57:33.340 --> 57:35.460
Six of 15 people found this interesting.

57:35.460 --> 57:36.740
Hold on, hold on, Travis.

57:36.740 --> 57:38.180
I gotta fucking, cause you said it.

57:38.180 --> 57:41.700
I had to sing the tasty Dutch trivia jingle

57:41.700 --> 57:43.660
or people will go wild.

57:43.660 --> 57:44.940
It's Dutch.

57:44.940 --> 57:46.740
Don't worry too much.

57:46.740 --> 57:48.820
Cause it's time for Dutch.

57:48.820 --> 57:50.660
Hot Dutch trivia.

57:50.660 --> 57:51.740
Now, there's a piece of trivia.

57:51.740 --> 57:53.820
Six of 15 found this interesting.

57:53.820 --> 57:55.620
Dutch, parentheses, Ed O'Neil.

57:55.620 --> 57:56.940
Wait, hold on.

57:56.940 --> 57:57.780
That's a bad hit rate.

57:57.780 --> 58:00.740
I see nine out of 15 people that cared enough

58:00.740 --> 58:02.060
to go look at the trivia for Dutch.

58:02.060 --> 58:04.260
You had to rate it very good.

58:04.260 --> 58:05.300
Looked at it and said,

58:05.300 --> 58:09.260
this actually isn't very interesting.

58:09.260 --> 58:11.020
I'm sorry that I wasted so much time

58:11.020 --> 58:12.580
looking at the trivia for Dutch.

58:12.580 --> 58:15.300
And you said, hold on, I gotta put this on a podcast.

58:15.300 --> 58:17.620
Dutch, parentheses, Ed O'Neil, and parentheses,

58:17.620 --> 58:19.060
says that at one point in his life,

58:19.060 --> 58:22.060
he drove a concrete truck, period.

58:22.060 --> 58:24.860
He and Doyle later hitch a ride on a truck

58:24.860 --> 58:27.380
that carries concrete pipes.

58:27.380 --> 58:28.980
End of trivia.

58:28.980 --> 58:32.460
Why are we talking about this fucking movie so much?

58:32.460 --> 58:35.140
There's some trivia too, but it's mostly spoilers.

58:36.460 --> 58:38.460
Sometimes I don't know how to stop it, Griff.

58:38.460 --> 58:40.500
That's what worries, that's what I get worried, honestly.

58:40.500 --> 58:41.660
I've tried a few times, Justin.

58:41.660 --> 58:43.420
I'm gonna have to say, you're a little bit complicit.

58:43.420 --> 58:46.420
You did write a whole song for Travis's-

58:46.420 --> 58:47.420
It's a jingle.

58:47.420 --> 58:48.700
Okay.

58:48.700 --> 58:50.540
If you're not gonna do them, I got to.

58:50.540 --> 58:51.860
I got another Yahoo here.

58:51.860 --> 58:53.340
And we'll do it real fast.

58:53.340 --> 58:54.180
We gotta end on not Dutch.

58:54.180 --> 58:55.660
I'm looking through the cast list down-

58:55.660 --> 58:57.700
Graham Robux- I'm just trying to see

58:57.700 --> 58:58.540
if there's any hidden gems.

58:58.540 --> 59:00.740
Graham Robux, from Yahoo Answers user la-la-la-la,

59:00.740 --> 59:05.740
who asks, when you catch a Frisbee, what are your options?

59:07.780 --> 59:09.460
Huh.

59:09.460 --> 59:11.820
When you catch a Frisbee, what are your options?

59:11.820 --> 59:13.620
Like, keep it?

59:13.620 --> 59:17.140
Catch it with both hands, or one hand is cool.

59:17.140 --> 59:18.540
You can do the one where you jump in the air

59:18.540 --> 59:19.780
and you catch it under your leg,

59:19.780 --> 59:21.860
like you're a neat youth pastor.

59:21.860 --> 59:24.420
Behind the back. I would say the best option

59:24.420 --> 59:26.140
is to always act like it's the first time

59:26.140 --> 59:28.900
you've ever successfully caught a Frisbee.

59:28.900 --> 59:31.500
And make it a real celebration.

59:31.500 --> 59:32.340
You know what I mean?

59:32.340 --> 59:34.500
Cause catching it's not assumed, right?

59:34.500 --> 59:36.460
There's no guarantee in this world

59:36.460 --> 59:38.260
that you're going to catch that Frisbee.

59:38.260 --> 59:41.220
So let's treat every time like it's your first.

59:41.220 --> 59:42.060
Yep.

59:43.740 --> 59:46.660
You could also catch it and take a big bite out of it.

59:46.660 --> 59:48.540
Yeah, catch it in your mouth like a doggie

59:48.540 --> 59:49.940
and take a big bite out of it,

59:49.940 --> 59:51.180
but then nobody can throw the Frisbee.

59:51.180 --> 59:52.020
So that's actually not,

59:52.020 --> 59:54.380
I'm gonna say that's actually not one of your options.

59:54.380 --> 59:55.220
I mean, it is an option.

59:55.220 --> 59:59.500
I would say probably the biggest crack up you could do

59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.140
would be to catch it

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:04.100
and then immediately spin around 180 degrees

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.820
and chuck it as hard as you can

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:07.300
at a person that is not there.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.580
That would be a real crack up.

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:11.740
Yeah, and you can shout like, catch dad.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:14.540
And then you throw it to nobody as far as you can.

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:15.940
And then you can look kind of sad

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:18.620
and no one's gonna ask you to clarify what just happened.

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:19.820
I guarantee it.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.220
You know, the director of Dutch,

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.500
it was his last movie he directed.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.060
You could throw it up in the air

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.740
and then have it coming right back down to you

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:31.220
and then say like, it's just me from now on.

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.140
You guys can go home

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.740
and you keep throwing it up to yourself.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.980
You could catch it and be like, oh nice, Dutch on DVD.

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:41.020
But this only works with the Frisbee is Dutch on DVD.

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:41.860
Correct.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:43.900
You could have another Frisbee

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.340
that you throw at the other Frisbee in midair

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:47.660
to knock it out.

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:52.660
And when you do that, you yell, Beyblade, rip it up!

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:58.340
This has been our show, my brother and me.

01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:01.820
Catch her to throw.

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.780
Do a back flip in midair.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:05.900
If you are in Canada

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.260
and you get one of these Christmas pizzas,

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.300
please tweet us a picture.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.980
Make it clap right on that Frisbee disc.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:11.820
What it looks like.

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.740
Cause I bet it does not look as tantalizing

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:16.140
as these images make it appear.

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:17.540
I feel like that could break bad really easily.

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.060
And if you are listening to this

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.420
and Dutch is your favorite movie,

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:21.260
please let me know.

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.080
I'm gonna hang up on the Skype call.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:22.920
You guys finish it.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.380
Please let me know if Dutch is your favorite movie.

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.180
Oh, Griffin did leave.

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.620
So anyway, this has been my brother, my brother, me.

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.580
We hope you enjoyed it.

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.700
We hope you're gonna download Dutch today.

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.860
And oh, Griff's back.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:36.700
Thank goodness.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.220
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters.

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:39.860
I'm just gonna barrel on through.

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:40.700
Cause I-

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.380
I won't reference the D movie again.

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.420
I can do a noise cancellation.

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:48.300
The D movie is the, of course, the third sequel

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.500
to the B movie.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:50.620
Okay.

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:51.460
All right.

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.700
Now we're back in safe territory.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:53.540
Make a judgment on B movie.

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:54.380
We got it all out of our system.

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.220
Okay.

01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:57.740
Go ahead, Travis.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.580
The latest episode of Paul Blart Moncop

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.020
Till Death Do Us Blart is out now

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:06.500
where we watch Paul Blart Moncop 2 every Thanksgiving.

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.580
The three of us and Guy Montgomery and Tim Batt

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.060
from Worst Idea of All Time.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:13.540
Episode five is up now if you haven't listened to it yet.

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:15.500
Also, because it is a new month,

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.460
there's lots of new merch to check out

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.060
over at McElroyMerch.com.

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.820
We're excited to see you all at Candle Nights

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:22.900
here in a couple of weeks.

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:23.780
If you're gonna be at the show,

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.100
make sure you send in questions,

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:28.060
make sure you write that they are, you know,

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:30.340
for the Candle Nights show in the subject line

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:32.620
that goes for Yahoo's as well.

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.100
What else, fellas?

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.740
Oh, if you can't come to Candle Nights,

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:41.820
you can still be a Candle Nights star.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:45.580
Every year, Riley Smurl and the other two Smurls,

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.380
all the whole Smurl family,

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.660
of Still Buffering fame raise money.

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:53.100
This year, it's going to contact

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.620
a Huntington-based organization.

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:56.780
This is a 24-hour rape crisis center.

01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:01.020
And it's a fun organization.

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:04.580
And for just $5, you can get a Candle Nights star

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:07.460
that we will display during the show.

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:08.900
So I think that's pretty cool.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.740
Absolutely. Honestly.

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.060
I think you should go do that right now.

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:14.900
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:16.260
for the use of our theme song.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.220
It's a departure off the album,

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.580
Putting the Days to Bed.

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:20.260
Great tune, great track.

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:24.500
One of the best, it's Rolling Stone's best song.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.220
They said. They said it.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.940
Rolling Stone said best song.

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.820
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.260
Go check out that hot new website, MaximumFun.org.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:33.620
Go look at all the shows on it.

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.300
Oh, you know what's a great gift?

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:37.220
You know what's a great gift to get someone?

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.220
If you say Dutch on DVD, I swear to God.

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.300
The knowledge that in just a couple months,

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.900
they are going to receive a copy

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.140
of the Adventure Zone Graphic Novel Book 3.

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:46.980
Oh, right.

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:49.780
You can pre-order that now, maybe include like a letter

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:51.500
about it in an envelope that says,

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.900
hey, in July, this book's all yours.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:55.940
It's based on the Pedals to the Metal arc

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:58.100
and it is so good, y'all.

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.020
Super good.

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:00.660
It's so good.

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:01.500
You're gonna like it.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.340
I got a final Yahoo here.

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.780
This one was sent in by Jeanette.

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:04.620
Thanks, Jeanette.

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.580
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:09.220
who I'm gonna call Dumpy asks,

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.380
what was the best decade of the 1990s?

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:16.260
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.500
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:18.820
Travis McElroy.

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.660
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:21.500
It's been my brother, my brother.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.020
May kiss your dad's square on the lips.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:41.300
I hate the girls, do you want to say, and I want to.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.020
Maximumfun.org.

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.420
Comedy and culture.

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:45.620
Artist owned.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:46.740
Audience supported.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:50.100
One, two, one, two, three, four.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:50.940
Hi, everybody.

01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:51.780
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.620
I'm Sydney McElroy.

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:53.940
We're both doctors and

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:54.780
Nope, just me.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:55.700
Okay, well Sydney's a doctor

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:57.780
and I'm a medical enthusiast

01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:59.780
and we create Sawbones,

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:01.260
a marital tour of misguided medicine.

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.860
Every week I dig through the annals of medical history

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:07.300
to bring you the wildest, grossest,

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.740
sometimes dumbest tales of ways

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.420
we've tried to treat people throughout history.

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:14.340
And lately we do a lot of modern fake medicine

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.220
because everything's a disaster,

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:18.940
but it's slightly less of a disaster every Friday

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:20.300
right here on Maximumfun.org

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:21.260
as we bring you Sawbones,

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.180
a marital tour of misguided medicine.

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:26.180
And remember, don't drill a hole in your head.
