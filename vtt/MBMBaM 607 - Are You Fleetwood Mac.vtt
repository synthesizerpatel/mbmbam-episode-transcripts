WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.760 --> 00:49.760
It's better, it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better, it's better with you

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
It's better, it's better with you

01:10.260 --> 01:16.300
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother and me. What a swing!

01:16.300 --> 01:22.840
Justin, I'm sorry. Wow, that was intense. That was a wild shift in energy from the beginning to end. That was my like

01:23.220 --> 01:29.540
The the the ball is going going it might be oh, nope, drop the outfield

01:31.180 --> 01:36.840
And then the guy was gonna pick it up his pants ripped and then everyone saw his butt and his

01:37.740 --> 01:40.260
Energy just dropped. Did I say I'm Justin? Yeah

01:40.260 --> 01:47.500
Yeah, and I'm Travis I guess. Wow. Wow. I'm Griffin. This is some of our best work yet guys

01:48.260 --> 01:51.980
And that is what we're here to celebrate a life in podcasting. Oh

01:53.700 --> 02:00.580
That the bill has come to the Piper has begun to play his little tune his jaunty tune

02:00.820 --> 02:06.500
That lures your wallet out of its protective case attached to your chain. Yes, and

02:06.500 --> 02:11.620
It starts to sneak those five dollar bills out once a month. It's the max fund driver

02:11.620 --> 02:18.300
Everybody welcome to this very special episode. We should say it is time to pay the Piper as Justin said. The Piper

02:19.020 --> 02:26.940
He's got bills to pay guys. Like people never talk about this, but like yeah Piper and it's it's all reasonable stuff

02:26.940 --> 02:31.780
You know, it's not like he doesn't have wild expenses or anything, but like piping's a job

02:31.780 --> 02:37.260
It's a job and you have to pay him or else and we don't talk about this a lot when we talk about the Pied Piper

02:37.420 --> 02:41.620
We talk about his great getting rid of rats or in this case as Justin has put it

02:42.900 --> 02:44.460
Your money five dollar bills

02:44.460 --> 02:44.660
Yes

02:44.660 --> 02:51.900
But if if that doesn't happen if he does if he is not fairly compensated for that then he takes the kids, right?

02:51.900 --> 02:53.300
He takes all the kids in town

02:53.300 --> 02:58.900
He plays this wonderful flute and makes all the children leave and then the people in town are like are you fucking?

02:58.900 --> 03:02.060
Kidding me Pied Piper. That is such an unnecessary

03:02.820 --> 03:08.060
Escalation so we're not saying if you don't like support the max fund drive and support our shows

03:08.140 --> 03:10.980
Then we'll play a magic flute that makes the kids leave. Yeah, but

03:11.740 --> 03:15.320
It's not off the table. But here's the thing at the end of the day

03:15.700 --> 03:20.380
They hired him to do a job get the rats out of town. Yeah, he did it

03:20.620 --> 03:22.700
Yeah, and they're like, oh cool the rats are gone

03:22.700 --> 03:28.140
Well, we're not paying you now the rats are already gone, which is pretty messed up pretty now taking the kids

03:28.140 --> 03:30.140
you're right huge a

03:30.300 --> 03:37.780
Lot of people make that like get a lot of people forget that the Pied Piper will play his beautiful music

03:38.340 --> 03:45.820
For free for anybody to listen and enjoy and a lot of people will listen to his great music while they're washing dishes

03:45.900 --> 03:50.300
You know, they'll open a window and they're like doing laundry and they sometimes

03:51.300 --> 03:55.660
Take it for granted that you know, he's always gonna be there

03:55.660 --> 04:01.820
All right that you know, then they're and they forget that it's you know that he relies on them

04:01.820 --> 04:07.300
Yeah, just because it's free to listen. He relies on their generosity maximum fun drive

04:11.660 --> 04:18.460
Maximum fun or no, it's not maximum fun drive. Don't listen to me. It's maximum fun org forward slash

04:18.460 --> 04:26.900
Join, that's the URL go there right now because it is on the max fund drive the one-time

04:26.900 --> 04:29.700
Year, we come to you and say hey these shows their artists owned

04:30.540 --> 04:33.300
Their audience supported. That's you. Yeah

04:34.140 --> 04:34.900
That's you

04:34.900 --> 04:41.220
That's the only reason our shows exist is because of your generosity and we need you now if you never gotten on board

04:41.220 --> 04:48.380
Then you need to head on over to maximum fun org for his last join for just five bucks a month

04:48.380 --> 04:54.780
If you can pledge five bucks a month, you are going to be unlocking an absolute treasure trove literal

04:55.540 --> 05:00.380
hundreds of hours of bonus content and there is a white

05:01.360 --> 05:08.460
Truly wild assortment. Maybe the most unhinged D&D campaign that has ever existed as designed by my daughter Charlie

05:08.460 --> 05:13.900
Yep, there is a pranky doodle dandy. What about this year Justin? What about this year this year? We?

05:15.020 --> 05:18.660
This one's still evolving folks. This one is exciting

05:19.300 --> 05:21.580
We did a special episode record

05:22.860 --> 05:24.740
brainstorming a new

05:24.740 --> 05:29.980
Transmedia property that we can sort of lean into that pays residuals

05:30.660 --> 05:35.060
in a way the podcasting does not and then we pitched it to our agent Joel and

05:35.060 --> 05:42.620
It's still an evolving story the details of which we hope to reveal to you

05:42.620 --> 05:45.300
Yes at some point in the near future. I'll just put it this way

05:45.300 --> 05:50.260
We thought it was so wildly unhinged that it would be we'd call Joel and Joel would be like

05:50.860 --> 05:55.500
You guys are fired even though I'm your agent and dad. Joe was like, okay

05:55.500 --> 06:02.040
I'll talk to people so you can hear all of that and more and all the other there's more levels if you're already a supporter

06:02.040 --> 06:06.800
I mean, it's time to up that their support check that out maximum fun org slash join

06:06.800 --> 06:10.200
Cuz the other thing about the Pied Piper is you think Pied Piper?

06:10.200 --> 06:14.240
He's been out there tootin his horn and flute and stuff for 12 years

06:14.560 --> 06:18.560
He's probably like doing doing the like the best he's ever done

06:18.560 --> 06:25.800
But then you got to remember that the Pied Piper for the last couple years hasn't been able to toot his flute out in public

06:25.800 --> 06:33.280
Because of the bubonic plague or what-have-you. Yeah, and so and so maybe the Pied Piper could use some

06:33.840 --> 06:36.440
Some extra support that's true and ever

06:37.760 --> 06:41.920
And also just one more thing if you do become a supporter make sure

06:42.520 --> 06:47.400
Talk about on social media. We're so grateful for that and keep an eye on the NB NB AM slash

06:47.760 --> 06:52.840
Macroy family account because we're gonna be announcing some special weird goals like we've done in the past

06:52.840 --> 06:59.320
But that's not what I want to talk about right now guys. It's okay been a little over one week since you look to me

07:00.640 --> 07:03.680
Thank you. It's been a solid 24 hours

07:03.680 --> 07:09.120
We've all been living with the announcement of band versus be now and I just we don't have any new information

07:09.640 --> 07:15.680
We haven't even released the episode or now. It's not out yet, but I just want to know how's your heart?

07:15.680 --> 07:17.680
How's your walk going guys?

07:17.680 --> 07:23.560
Yeah, what this is the the intro that you want to do to this episode is just redoing the one we did last

07:25.040 --> 07:28.920
Which we recorded for the audience's clarification yesterday yesterday. Yes, exactly

07:28.920 --> 07:33.800
I just want to know if you've marinated in it how you're feeling. I share I did share with my wife

07:33.800 --> 07:38.080
I heard the image. She's like we're absolutely watching that I'll burn in hell first

07:38.320 --> 07:42.720
But then I said of course we'll watch it because we're gonna be live-streaming every second now

07:42.720 --> 07:49.240
It's green caps. Yes the whole thing when I told my wife. She said um. Oh, yeah, he's got baby now. He needs that money

07:49.920 --> 07:56.000
Which was an excellent point? I think on Teresa's part. Yeah, he wants to make something the baby can enjoy cuz babies hate bees

07:56.400 --> 07:58.680
Yeah, baby's do anything about

08:06.120 --> 08:10.760
Suspicion we're gonna get a lot of feedback that we went a little hard on man versus be

08:10.760 --> 08:12.760
Yeah

08:13.120 --> 08:14.560
Yeah

08:14.560 --> 08:18.480
Let's instead just as a thought experiment. Okay

08:19.000 --> 08:25.240
Read a listener's question and then attempt to answer it. Oh weird. Okay. Okay. I mean just like I don't know

08:25.240 --> 08:27.240
It's just something else do it

08:27.560 --> 08:34.880
Recently I started a new job where one of the perks is that we have a cabinet full of office supplies that are free for

08:34.880 --> 08:36.320
us to take

08:36.320 --> 08:43.280
Sorry, it's just the idea of a office of that has cabinet with office supplies in it being a perk of the job

08:43.280 --> 08:49.580
Send a chill up my spine. You have the essential tools. You need to do your work. There are pins. There are notepads and

08:50.800 --> 08:55.820
Yes, and Jimmy clips. Yeah, you have to put on your penis. Yeah

08:56.440 --> 08:58.440
Keeps you from finishing. What's it?

08:58.440 --> 09:05.160
What's the Jimmy clip, huh? Well, you know how sometimes you finish too fast. Yeah. Yeah never

09:08.920 --> 09:14.080
You understand the concept though that one could finish too fast a Jimmy clip just kind of

09:15.080 --> 09:18.040
Prevents that by sort of closing everything up down there. Yeah. Yeah

09:18.560 --> 09:23.560
Does it get in the way? Oh, absolutely. It does. Is it wildly painful? Oh, yeah

09:24.280 --> 09:26.280
involved effective

09:26.280 --> 09:28.580
I mean, yeah in a sort of brute-force way

09:31.680 --> 09:34.160
Beloved listener a Jimmy clip is

09:36.280 --> 09:40.040
Something that you is a piece of guitar paraphernalia

09:41.280 --> 09:48.400
That tightens your tone by well you put it up near the the head of your guitar and it tightens your tone

09:48.400 --> 09:53.220
I think it maybe makes palm muting easier. I don't know what you think a Jimmy clip is

09:53.220 --> 09:59.900
This is a question the right. Yeah, there is no question. Where's the question raised? Yeah, this is not what a Jimmy clip is

09:59.900 --> 10:01.900
What's a Jimmy clip?

10:01.900 --> 10:06.140
Okay, what could it be could be a binder clip one of those that's like, you know

10:06.140 --> 10:12.260
You squeeze the two sides and it opens up. Let's think of it a mouth. That's what I always think of it as

10:12.460 --> 10:17.540
Yeah, and that is what I and that is what you would apply to the genitals

10:17.540 --> 10:24.460
Is it possible that this listener maybe reply or refers to paper as Jimmy just in general?

10:25.500 --> 10:30.340
Hand me that news Jimmy. I want to read the good news today. Is this a Xerox?

10:30.820 --> 10:35.980
Slash copier kind of situation where we've been calling paper clips paper clips the whole time

10:35.980 --> 10:42.860
But that's the like brand name and Jimmy clip is just the actual name like hook and loop instead of velcro

10:42.860 --> 10:45.220
Is that what we're dealing with? I can't fathom

10:45.220 --> 10:47.780
I've googled it in every way I could think of yeah

10:47.780 --> 10:53.140
That's the best I've come up with so far is Jimmy Fallon a clip of Jimmy Fallon

10:53.620 --> 10:57.020
Performing with Migos using office supplies. That's all I can get

10:57.020 --> 11:02.900
I can't I can't get anything else now. Is it possible that they work in an office based around ice cream and

11:03.620 --> 11:07.540
Jimmy's aka sprinkles. This is a clip to hold the jimmies together

11:07.940 --> 11:14.460
It's possible be but who but I think it should be illegal to call sprinkles jimmies. Oh, that's an excellent point

11:14.460 --> 11:19.300
Their name is James. Thank you. Now. I have found a single track on title

11:20.420 --> 11:23.940
where an artist guest performed on a

11:25.300 --> 11:31.920
Rap track called plan B and it guest stars a person named Jimmy paperclips

11:33.700 --> 11:40.300
Maybe that's a reference to him being in there to one-time rapper Jimmy paperclips. Oh, I accidentally clicked it and I'm listen to it

11:40.300 --> 11:43.740
Hey, this is good. This is good stuff. Jimmy. All right

11:43.740 --> 11:49.180
It's good. Should we should we do the rest of the question or I guess I just that's the first piece of advice

11:49.180 --> 11:53.020
It's just don't call them that they're not that they're not that whatever it is

11:53.020 --> 11:57.520
And this is and and my friend as far as the Internet knows this is not a regional thing

11:57.520 --> 11:59.520
I think it's a you think it's a you thing

11:59.820 --> 12:03.660
However, there is a sign on the cabinet that discourages any hoarding of the office supplies

12:03.660 --> 12:08.060
I do understand. They don't want us to clean out the cabinet, but my desk is nowhere near the cabinet

12:08.060 --> 12:13.460
So I want to go ahead and take what I know I will use and not have to come back to the cabinet too frequently

12:13.460 --> 12:19.580
My question is how much can I take before it's considered hoarding or how do I get all the supplies?

12:19.580 --> 12:24.100
I need my desk that raises suspicions. That's from admin anxiety in Atlanta

12:24.100 --> 12:28.140
I do want to I do want to put in a pitch right here that sitting is killing us

12:28.500 --> 12:33.460
And maybe it's not the worst thing to have a little built-in like stroll

12:33.460 --> 12:39.540
Yeah, just to get the circulation just to steady or so. Yeah, I'll say it sitting has been great for me

12:39.540 --> 12:44.660
My whole lot me and sitting are very well acquainted and I am still

12:45.260 --> 12:47.900
Such a huge I can't get enough of this stuff

12:47.900 --> 12:52.640
I would actually go one step further and say that maybe Justin the problem is

12:53.020 --> 12:59.220
Sitting isn't reclined enough and we should recline. We need more Shays lounges. Oh, that's good

12:59.340 --> 13:06.820
Yeah, is that sitting is the problem Justin, but you know what so is standing? Yeah, what about lying down desks, huh?

13:06.820 --> 13:12.860
Yes, though the opposite way. Yes. This is what I'm saying zero G desks

13:13.300 --> 13:17.100
Yeah, you know those thing where it's just like not only is a VR helmet

13:17.100 --> 13:22.020
Like I also walk on the little slippery disc and so it's like I'm walking in there a desk like that

13:22.020 --> 13:27.140
But I'm laying down and I can maybe do a 360 spin in there gyroscopes

13:27.140 --> 13:31.500
It just sort of sensory deprivation workstation. Yes, please

13:31.500 --> 13:37.180
Also, is it so bad to have an excuse to get up from your desk and not work for the time?

13:37.180 --> 13:41.780
It takes to walk over there and back and then if your boss is like he didn't get anything done today

13:41.780 --> 13:44.140
You're like I just kept running out of Jimmy clips my dude

13:44.140 --> 13:49.660
I'm gonna get more Jimmy's you don't worry you got me all anxious with this note about not hoarding the supply

13:49.660 --> 13:53.860
So I only do take one Jimmy clip at a time and then I have to come back and that's my whole day

13:53.860 --> 13:58.040
It's like 60 to 70 trips to the cabinet just to get 60 to 70 Jimmy clips

13:58.040 --> 14:00.040
This

14:00.760 --> 14:06.880
Sucks this sucks that this is a thing that you have to that any human being

14:07.160 --> 14:14.920
Has to think about to the point of being even a little bit stressed is how many work supplies is too many work supplies to

14:14.920 --> 14:18.560
Take to my desk. What do you think you're gonna do with them?

14:18.560 --> 14:22.800
Do you think that you're gonna build some sort of mobile out of Jimmy clips?

14:23.800 --> 14:27.080
Hey timeout Griffin. You've never worked an office job. Yes

14:27.080 --> 14:28.040
I

14:28.040 --> 14:34.160
Take it from me a person who has the idea of like well, it's 10 a.m. And I'm done with my work

14:34.160 --> 14:41.540
I could go ask what else they need me to work on or I could make a decorative picture out of different colored

14:41.800 --> 14:46.120
You know post-it notes arranged in a way that it looks like Mario's face. I

14:46.720 --> 14:51.540
Know what I'll be doing today. Yeah, and do you work in Nintendo at this?

14:51.540 --> 14:58.060
At not at that point, but then what's that? Oh, I made this collage out of post-it notes walking by

14:58.220 --> 15:03.080
Well, it's Mario himself and he sees that he's like it's a me and I'm like, it's a you

15:03.380 --> 15:08.060
And then he hires me and what's that now? I'm his bag man

15:08.620 --> 15:12.440
Which I think I'm his valet, you know, yes

15:14.060 --> 15:18.340
Yeah, and then pretty soon look at me I'm running the whole show so

15:18.340 --> 15:26.100
Maybe it's not so bad. Everybody try that out. Yeah, that's the one way to get hired by Nintendo. Yep

15:26.940 --> 15:31.340
This or also you push you could push Reggie Feasomey out of the way of a

15:31.820 --> 15:38.540
Speeding bus and he doesn't work there anymore, but he is he needs you. He is very big and fun to think about

15:38.540 --> 15:45.260
A certain Herman Munster as quality

15:48.140 --> 15:52.060
Herman Munster is a beefcake. Yeah, Jerry O'Connell. Yeah

15:53.540 --> 15:56.020
Jerry O'Connell seems fun. He does doesn't he?

15:56.020 --> 16:00.940
Do they sound like he'd be fun and I tweeted him about my secret identity and he was like

16:01.060 --> 16:07.540
You're a second person's asked me about that today and I was like you want to be my best friend or what's up?

16:07.540 --> 16:12.100
It's nothing nothing so far like I just feel like he's nervous. He doesn't know how to respond

16:12.100 --> 16:17.580
He doesn't want to embarrass himself. That is a treacherous balloon to float in the year of our Lord 2022

16:17.580 --> 16:20.140
It is true, right? This person seems like a good

16:20.820 --> 16:22.820
Yeah, anything anybody?

16:23.500 --> 16:26.540
Good period um you another question. I

16:28.320 --> 16:30.320
Have

16:30.580 --> 16:36.300
This is a great great opening to a question this I know everything about this person

16:36.300 --> 16:40.660
I think I bet I could guess their social security number best on this first question. I have a fedora

16:40.660 --> 16:48.100
It's actually a trilby, but who cares I think that's a I think that's a haiku. I'm pretty sure that's I have a fedora

16:49.100 --> 16:52.860
It's actually a trilby, but who cares

16:54.780 --> 16:57.300
We're just very close though silent

16:57.380 --> 16:57.860
Yeah

16:57.860 --> 17:05.580
It has been with me for 12 years even survived being stolen by a hurricane in 2012 and washed up in parking lot

17:05.580 --> 17:08.180
What it's a state it's it wait

17:09.300 --> 17:11.180
bounded yeah

17:11.180 --> 17:17.400
Okay, it's a survivor from a bygone age ain't that the true. Oh, yeah, should I get rid of my hat?

17:19.060 --> 17:23.180
I'm moving so it might be time. Yeah, here's a photo for the slack

17:25.740 --> 17:28.420
Trilling for trilby in Los Angeles I

17:29.360 --> 17:31.360
Don't know you that well. Oh

17:31.360 --> 17:37.920
Oh really because you said earlier you could like give their social security number Justin so what I read I read you're right Travis

17:37.920 --> 17:42.780
I'm I I don't know you for a very long time. There you go. Is that better? Yeah

17:43.840 --> 17:46.880
Grammatically no, but conceptually yes, I feel like

17:47.920 --> 17:54.440
From what I can read in this question. I feel like you and the hat have become inseparable at this point

17:54.440 --> 17:56.240
Oh, yeah, I feel like the hat wrote the question

17:56.240 --> 18:01.880
I mean really I mean at this point literally the hat was taken from you by an act of God and made its way back

18:01.880 --> 18:05.920
To you. Yeah, God tried to take the the hat and and couldn't do it

18:06.200 --> 18:09.800
Who are you to just casually toss it in the dumpster?

18:09.800 --> 18:14.920
I will also say this no matter what the item is whether it be clothing or decoration or whatever

18:15.520 --> 18:17.520
after 12 years

18:17.640 --> 18:21.420
You then I don't think you have to justify to anyone

18:21.420 --> 18:25.860
Why you have it because there's someone's like why you have that him?

18:25.860 --> 18:27.740
Like I've had it for like a long time

18:27.740 --> 18:34.500
I had it for 12 years right like that's just like oh at this point it's become part of your yeah your routine

18:34.700 --> 18:37.740
That that hat exists. You've long passed that like

18:38.420 --> 18:42.060
Awkward liminal space where you've had the hat for like five years

18:42.060 --> 18:49.060
And so some people associate you with the hat but not everyone so you can get rid of it a 12-year hat my god

18:49.060 --> 18:55.860
Yeah, the memories that's the the the juices you've imbued in this thing is it you can't

18:55.860 --> 18:58.300
I don't think you can get rid of it now. Don't get me wrong

18:59.820 --> 19:05.220
Aesthetically, I don't think many people unless you are Bob Hoskins in Who Framed Roger Rabbit

19:05.220 --> 19:10.620
I don't think you can pull off this particular hat. It seems like a very sort of specific sees

19:10.620 --> 19:18.460
That's your pole and not Indiana Jones, huh? Indiana Jones's hat didn't it was not quite as decorative as this

19:18.460 --> 19:22.940
This was very straightforward more of a wide brim. This is a trilby not a fedora after all

19:24.600 --> 19:27.860
Yeah, I do you look good in it hmm. Oh

19:28.860 --> 19:34.500
That would have been a better image to send a hey. Yes, I will say this. I'm gonna read between the line

19:34.500 --> 19:36.500
I'm gonna infer for a moment here. I

19:36.500 --> 19:41.460
I would pose this as a potential backstories boys that they bought this hat and

19:42.180 --> 19:46.160
They put it on they're like, I don't know and then someone gave him a hard time about it

19:46.160 --> 19:49.240
So they doubled down on the hat and like no, I love this hat, right?

19:49.240 --> 19:52.060
And then hurricane took it and they're like, oh, I'm free. I'm free from the hat

19:52.060 --> 19:55.100
Well, it came back shit mask and now yes

19:55.100 --> 20:01.500
This is a mask situation because moving is not a time or just like I have to get rid of this hat that takes up

20:01.500 --> 20:03.500
Let's be honest and not that much space

20:03.500 --> 20:07.340
Right, so if they're asking about if they should get rid of it or not

20:07.340 --> 20:12.580
I think they're looking for us to say yes, so they're like I had to get rid of it

20:12.580 --> 20:17.220
I was a man always told me to yeah, I want to go back to Griffin's question

20:17.220 --> 20:22.020
I and and say that I really hope this person thinks they look good in the house

20:22.020 --> 20:27.500
Yeah, because the idea that you would do sort of like a self-shaming

20:27.500 --> 20:34.420
You you know self-flagellation aesthetic flagellation. Yeah by wearing a hat you think looks bad for 12 years

20:34.420 --> 20:36.460
Yeah is actually too sad for me to

20:36.860 --> 20:41.380
To think on I I hope that's not unless the problem is you found yourself to be too beautiful

20:41.540 --> 20:44.460
Sands hat and you got sick of all of the attention

20:44.460 --> 20:51.340
I see people just flinging themselves at you offering you modeling deals left and right and you're like I gotta do something

20:51.340 --> 20:58.420
They got horns off of there. Yeah, real horns like as a Brock. That would be a good look though. Is that what you're saying?

20:59.820 --> 21:06.340
Yeah, I mean I guess so people want to fuck Darth Maul every day people do want to be fucking Darth Maul

21:06.340 --> 21:11.280
I've noticed that it's I don't know when this thing started. He's a bad man who did hurt Qui-Gon Jinn

21:11.740 --> 21:18.140
I well, I sure hope you like this hat cuz if not, this has been a terrible waste of our time

21:18.140 --> 21:24.300
It's like thank you. Yeah, that was my next thought was that if you're not actually torn up about this and instead

21:24.680 --> 21:29.020
You came to us with this very specific heat of I'm a hat owner

21:30.020 --> 21:32.380
Man alive that's gonna really p.m. You know

21:36.900 --> 21:38.740
Yeah, you could

21:38.740 --> 21:45.220
Find some sort of acrylic box to put it in on a mantle and be like, that's the hat that God couldn't kill, right?

21:45.220 --> 21:48.900
Yeah, or you could and then you can like screw in a little plaque on it

21:48.900 --> 21:52.780
It says this is Bob Hoskins is his real ass hat from who frame Roger Rabbit

21:52.780 --> 21:55.140
Oh, you know what? We need to start doing

21:55.140 --> 21:59.660
I think that people at home should adopt what they do at like sporting arenas when a player retires

22:00.140 --> 22:04.340
When there's a shirt where you're like, I love this shirt. It doesn't match my style anymore or whatever

22:04.340 --> 22:09.700
We should raise it up into the rafters of your house, right? It's just like now it's on the ceiling. Oh, that's good

22:09.700 --> 22:15.860
That's really good. Travis. Can I hit you with another idea? That is that I leapfrogged off that idea to get sure and I'm

22:15.860 --> 22:18.420
Really happy about it. Get really into hockey

22:19.260 --> 22:24.300
And then wait for a player on the team that you like to score three goals in a single game

22:24.300 --> 22:29.500
And I goodbye fedora that well that one's going right out to celebrate the hat trick

22:29.500 --> 22:33.340
And then they fly that fedora up into the rafters of the hockey area

22:33.340 --> 22:38.220
No, you throw that fedora out and I think some teams they like put all the hats in a bucket

22:38.220 --> 22:41.420
And then as you walk out of the venue, you can maybe try and grab your hat back

22:41.700 --> 22:44.100
But I know what's gonna grab this busted

22:45.100 --> 22:47.100
That can't be

22:47.380 --> 22:52.580
You're gonna have to voluntarily leave it behind. Is that my trilby now? Someone else must have thrown that trilby

22:52.580 --> 22:56.060
I don't know. I saw you throw it. I know you thought no, I wasn't

22:56.740 --> 23:01.540
That wasn't mine. My trilby definitely looked way cooler than this drill

23:01.540 --> 23:06.580
Do you see who frame Roger Abbott mine looked like that looked exactly it actually was that one

23:06.580 --> 23:12.140
I stole it from the studio lot. I have an acrylic box for a while, but then I threw it

23:12.140 --> 23:16.740
I mean fuck I know I didn't throw it. I'm I still at home in the box. Leave me alone

23:17.460 --> 23:19.460
I'm going to Arby's

23:20.100 --> 23:28.180
Hey, listen speaking of going to Arby's it would be great if you could support us in the max fun drive so that we can go

23:28.740 --> 23:36.100
Get more Arby's. Yeah, your max fun membership pays to support the shows that you like on the network

23:36.100 --> 23:38.740
This I feel like this past year we have

23:39.900 --> 23:47.940
We have upped our game pretty dramatically. We started doing adventure zone weekly again, which has been a fucking lot of work

23:48.580 --> 23:52.460
But we have enjoyed making the show, but we've had

23:53.620 --> 23:57.880
Yeah, Justin and I are coasting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you guys are right

23:58.060 --> 24:03.700
We've we've hired some more people to help we've hired a full-time editor for the first time

24:03.700 --> 24:07.100
in in the history of our shows we talk about how the

24:07.700 --> 24:12.700
Donations are essential to make the shows happen like we have missed a lot fewer episodes

24:12.700 --> 24:14.460
Yeah of show

24:14.460 --> 24:20.820
Since we have people who are helping us to make sure that they get since we hired bosses. Yeah

24:21.740 --> 24:28.820
We hire bosses to tell us to do podcasts even if we don't want to or if our feet hurt and we're sad

24:28.820 --> 24:34.060
And I mean not just that, you know, we wait our feet hurt. It's just not a big rock

24:34.900 --> 24:41.200
Yeah, parking lot. I can't record my feet hurt. Tell me we have not canceled episodes for for less

24:42.860 --> 24:47.660
That's true, sometimes it's like I don't know I meant to eat a sandwich and I ate

24:48.020 --> 24:51.100
Half a sandwich and yeah, I can't do it today boys

24:51.100 --> 24:57.140
And I mean there's also the very kind of bigger side of it of like this is our jobs

24:57.140 --> 24:59.500
I mean the stuff what we make we

25:00.340 --> 25:06.460
Make this a priority. It's important for us to do this and we know how much it means to people and this is the time

25:06.460 --> 25:11.220
Of year where it means everything. It means I'm not gonna it means everything. I don't want to say that but yeah

25:12.740 --> 25:17.660
Okay. Wow, what's again a rapid energy shift from Justin? What are the gifts?

25:17.660 --> 25:22.860
Like what do you get like I don't want to do this for free besides like feeling good and like yeah, that's stew

25:22.860 --> 25:28.140
I don't care. Okay, so for $5 a month you will get immediate. I did that

Don't know but it's got there's so much good stuff. We've been doing this for this is our 11th max fun drive

25:48.140 --> 25:53.220
I want to say the amount of content just from us from our mini shows is like

25:53.780 --> 25:55.980
Outrageous at this point. I cannot remember it all

25:56.660 --> 25:59.700
But it's there's some really good shit in there

26:00.540 --> 26:03.600

Patches that you can put on any kind of surface that you want that I mean, we'll work on patches

26:26.560 --> 26:29.620
You can't put it on like steel. I bet I mean

26:30.420 --> 26:34.660
There's glue. They're beautiful two-inch round patches with very very

26:35.580 --> 26:40.420

26:50.860 --> 26:58.140
Between the max fun creativity pack or the rocket hat. The creativity pack is was designed by artist and max funster

26:58.140 --> 27:00.900
Ellen van der meid and it's a deck of

27:01.500 --> 27:07.260
54 cards in an inspiration deck and each one has an activity suggestion from your favorite hosts

27:28.940 --> 27:33.980
It's adjustable and it's gonna keep you cool and shaded while you listen to podcasts out in nature

27:33.980 --> 27:40.140
There's other rewards to you. We'll talk about those more later, but I also would encourage you if you're already a max fun member

27:40.140 --> 27:46.340
And you have been for a while. Maybe this is the time to consider upgrading your membership to a higher support level

27:46.340 --> 27:48.540
Maybe you've been listening to more max fun shows

27:48.980 --> 27:54.940
Maybe let's say your favorite actual play podcast started doing every week instead of just once a week and you're like, hey

27:55.100 --> 27:57.100
That's why I'm even your second or third

27:57.100 --> 28:05.380
Maybe and the actual play podcast that you have heard of started doing every week instead of just once a week or once

28:05.380 --> 28:07.380
Every week instead of once. Okay

28:07.940 --> 28:13.260
You stick with me, you know what? I mean? This is a great time. You can upgrade that to maximum fun org slash join

28:13.980 --> 28:16.620
And I want to say one more thing because I think it's always important to mention

28:16.620 --> 28:21.380
We know that not everybody is able to do a monthly support level and we totally get that

28:21.380 --> 28:26.980
You know, we're we're asking you to consider if you can but there's other ways you can help you can help share the link

28:27.580 --> 28:30.720
Maximum fun org slash join you could talk about why?

28:31.420 --> 28:33.020
Max fun means a lot to you

28:33.020 --> 28:36.860
Make sure everyone knows the max fun drive is going on all of that stuff is great

28:36.860 --> 28:42.260
And if you're already a supporter you could talk about how great it is all the the bonus content

28:42.820 --> 28:47.660
How how it feels to support the art and artists you love all of that stuff helping get the word out

28:48.020 --> 28:50.020
Means a lot to us as well

28:50.020 --> 28:54.660
just go to maximum fun org first last join and just

28:55.380 --> 28:59.380
Do the right thing. We have a goal this year of two new and upgrading members

28:59.380 --> 29:04.340
And so we're really hoping you can have us a 50% of that could be you so

29:05.780 --> 29:08.660
We're gonna rock it past that goal within the first week

29:10.580 --> 29:16.100
Well, I missed a zero it's 20 20 no, wait, I'm sorry and then there were three more zeros after that

29:16.100 --> 29:23.380
Oh, I don't I don't count zeros. They're not real numbers. Yeah, it's just a demarcation between positive and negative value

29:23.380 --> 29:25.100
Yeah, it's not actually

29:25.100 --> 29:27.100
worth talking about

29:27.180 --> 29:33.020
Maximum fund our success joint. I just yeah, but I wanted it to be I wanted it to be the last thing that we said

29:33.020 --> 29:36.140
In this break, so now I have to say it again maximum fun org slash join

29:36.140 --> 29:44.780
Hit it you want it there. Yeah. Do you want to hey, should we say hi to the wizard and just approach them quiet? Yeah, don't

29:46.020 --> 29:48.020
Don't like jump out and

29:48.220 --> 29:50.220
Thank you

29:50.180 --> 29:52.180
this

29:53.860 --> 29:55.860
Smart yeah, yeah

29:56.100 --> 30:01.120
Gross, it's not gross. It's beautiful. You calm me down. You relaxed me. It's gross to give your brother

30:01.120 --> 30:06.320
as there are a nice head gift from me Justin McElroy

30:07.000 --> 30:09.480
ASMR I wouldn't say that you gave me tingles

30:12.360 --> 30:14.360
I got tinky-winkies, but it's fine

30:18.040 --> 30:22.320
And of course they originated from my nipples as all as they do

30:22.800 --> 30:25.720
That's the that's what Travis calls the epicenter

30:25.720 --> 30:32.160
Yeah, it goes then down under the armpit swirls around in there for a while then up the skull down into the nostril out

30:32.160 --> 30:37.640
Of the mouth and down to the taint comes close to the taint, but then it swerves back the last thing

30:39.760 --> 30:43.080
Anymore oh, yeah, what's wrong? Lots of people sent this one and thank you

30:43.080 --> 30:46.480
We're comfortable talking about our bodies with each other. I'm field

30:46.480 --> 30:50.640
I'm actually comfortable with the amount of comfort that we have about that particular subject

30:51.040 --> 30:53.760
This is how to be okay at your first attention. I

30:53.760 --> 30:59.840
I love that. I wish I would love an article. That was just how to be okay in general

31:00.520 --> 31:03.440
Yeah, I think we could all use that wiki how article you never got

31:03.440 --> 31:09.000
There's also lots of first things that I've done in my life that I wish I could go back and be okay at the first

31:09.000 --> 31:12.480
Yeah, I don't need to name them, but you could probably fill in a lot of the blanks

31:12.920 --> 31:14.840
You've never gotten a detention before right?

31:14.840 --> 31:20.120
But today you just happen to lie about getting an A on an assignment that you never did and your teacher finds out oops

31:20.120 --> 31:23.960
That's terrible. But today it won't be what what what kind of lie is that?

31:24.720 --> 31:30.480
Also, why would your teacher care? Yeah enough to give you detention. I got an A on the math test

31:30.480 --> 31:35.160
You were absent during the math test. You have detention now. That's not really a punishable

31:36.120 --> 31:40.940
Thing. Yeah. Have you all ever had detention? Did you all ever get detention? Yeah me. Yeah

31:42.520 --> 31:44.520
I got

31:44.520 --> 31:50.320
Yeah, one time I got it one time me and Eric Stokes were cutting up in the library cutting up books damn

31:50.320 --> 31:52.320
You must have been cutting up real hard

31:52.560 --> 31:56.120
Yeah, it was pretty intense cutting up. I can't remember what I did, but I did

31:56.840 --> 32:04.040
Justin do you remember the guy? I think was at our middle school Griffin to who on in spirit week always wore the Star Trek uniform

32:05.040 --> 32:09.360
Yes, holy shit. Yeah, how's your memory that good Trav?

32:09.360 --> 32:15.260
Oh, I don't remember his name Griffin, but I remember the guy who wore the Star Trek uniform at least once

32:15.260 --> 32:21.720
Yeah, man, he is cordially invited to our podcast. Whatever whenever you want host into the zoom call. I was in

32:22.520 --> 32:25.340
His room for detention once it was like an all-day thing

32:25.340 --> 32:30.940
Which was also weird and I just remember I'd finished my work like two hours in and I had some comic books on my backpack

32:30.940 --> 32:33.520
So I was a real cool dude and I was like I finished my work

32:33.520 --> 32:35.600
Can I just sit here and read comic books and he was like, yeah

32:35.600 --> 32:39.700
And it was not that bad all things considered everybody

32:40.480 --> 32:42.480
detention kind of ruled

32:43.120 --> 32:46.680
I'm I'm really glad to hear that mine was uneventful

32:46.680 --> 32:49.320
It was in the art room and I got it because I accidentally

32:50.000 --> 32:52.760
Knocked a table over and it hit Ashley filling her in the leg

32:52.760 --> 32:55.040
I got they did not like that

32:55.040 --> 32:59.360
her mom was a teacher and so I feel like there was like a little bit a little bit of like

32:59.360 --> 33:04.600
I don't get she didn't get hurt or anything and it was an accident and then she wrote on the pink slip

33:04.600 --> 33:08.860
In an attempt to try and be cute Griffin flipped a table over it

33:09.880 --> 33:14.040
Is that fair like give me the detention but you don't have no I'm asking you now

33:14.040 --> 33:16.040
Is that were you trying to be cute?

33:16.560 --> 33:20.860
I was I was goofing but I wasn't like this will be cute. I'll hurt this girl's leg

33:20.960 --> 33:25.540
Yeah, like that's not my sort of vibe. Anyway, you have anything you want to say Ashley?

33:25.540 --> 33:29.960
I'm really sorry Ashley like I I didn't even hit you that hard

33:29.960 --> 33:37.600
and it and it was an accident and you did forgive me right away and you actually felt bad that I got detention which was

33:39.760 --> 33:41.920
That should matter that should count for something

33:42.760 --> 33:47.680
There should be she wasn't person. She wasn't pressing there should be an option for that right?

33:47.680 --> 33:54.360
Oh, I remember once my friend hunter went to sit down in a chair and because of ADHD and impulse control

33:54.360 --> 33:57.920
I pulled the chair moved it and he fell on his butt and he literally said why did you do that?

33:57.920 --> 33:59.920
I said hunter. I have no idea. I'm so sorry

34:00.680 --> 34:05.440
Like what happened over there and honor was like nothing. Don't worry about it. It was fine. So solid hunter

34:05.440 --> 34:07.440
It was a solid move hunter

34:08.280 --> 34:13.520
Okay, so step one get the detention your teachers just talked to you and you are crying. This is bad

34:15.400 --> 34:16.720
This is bad

34:16.720 --> 34:20.080
Especially if it is at the beginning of the day because then you'll just have the worst day ever

34:20.080 --> 34:21.880
You need to take a breath and dry your eyes

34:21.880 --> 34:26.520
This time is about you ask if you may go to the restroom if you need a few minutes to yourself

34:26.520 --> 34:29.640
That is so strong if you have a full fucking

34:30.000 --> 34:36.480
Breakdown and you're like may I be excused to collect my thoughts for this heinous punishment that you have laid at my feet

34:37.000 --> 34:37.880
Now I'm sorry

34:37.880 --> 34:42.400
I could make the argument that it'd be way worse to get right at the end of the day when you think like oh

34:42.400 --> 34:45.920
Only five minutes left and then I get to go home and play all the banjo-kazooie

34:45.920 --> 34:51.200
I want and then the teachers like you have to stay an extra like hour and a half or whatever and you're like what?

34:51.200 --> 34:53.640
To have the run if you have all day

34:53.640 --> 35:00.960
To get used to the idea and cancel your plans mentally. I don't write banjo and kazooie are waiting for me

35:00.960 --> 35:07.880
Yeah, I have made commitments that I intend to keep teacher. You don't understand. They are they only get to live while I play the game

35:09.120 --> 35:12.840
If a friend or acquaintance even an enemy asks what is wrong

35:12.840 --> 35:16.240
Do not tell them the whole world does not need to know what just happened

35:16.240 --> 35:19.280
That is your information for you to know and for them not to find out

35:19.360 --> 35:22.640
Hey, I heard you flipped a table over on Ashley fillinger. I don't know

35:22.640 --> 35:23.800
anything

35:23.800 --> 35:29.520
Anything about that actually that does not sound like anything I would do does it you must have a response?

35:29.520 --> 35:31.520
Oh, is that what's going around? Oh?

35:32.040 --> 35:35.840
Interesting. I never thought that you would be one to fall prey to rumors and

35:39.160 --> 35:43.760
Are you Fleetwood Mac because you're making a lot of rumors try to talk to the teacher

35:43.760 --> 35:47.560
Don't make excuses and don't try saying you didn't do it because they might think you are lying

35:47.560 --> 35:49.520
Just explain what happened and tell them that you're sorry

35:49.520 --> 35:52.800
Let them know even if you don't truly that you understand why you're in trouble

35:52.800 --> 35:56.800
Tell them and be true to your word that you will not let it happen again. I mean

35:57.840 --> 36:00.400
You I've never known a teacher. That's like okay

36:01.400 --> 36:04.840
Undetention no detention. I mean if you sold it hard enough

36:05.280 --> 36:09.640
But also I like how a wiki had just slipped in there in the middle even if you feel nothing inside

36:10.040 --> 36:16.020
Apologize anyway, even even if you don't understand why you got yeah, I won't do it again, or I will do it again

36:16.020 --> 36:20.760
Which one is the is it? I'll do it the same amount

36:21.600 --> 36:25.760
I just remembered that I this is not a particularly fun memory

36:25.760 --> 36:29.240
But I got the tension on the last day of high school. I attended

36:30.320 --> 36:32.320
Because they had started to crack down

36:32.940 --> 36:39.840
Like really really really hard on being late for first period because apparently it was just like an epidemic

36:39.840 --> 36:42.040
so they had like a zero tolerance policy that they

36:42.040 --> 36:45.320
started doing this this one day and

36:46.000 --> 36:51.080
The last day of school mom was no no no my last day of I didn't attend

36:51.560 --> 36:54.560
The last like month of my senior year of high school

36:55.480 --> 36:58.040
Because mom was in the hospital and I had stayed overnight

36:58.040 --> 37:03.460
And so at the Alex that my friend who picked me up from school or picked me up and drove me to school

37:04.000 --> 37:08.160
We were like coming in late and somebody was like, hey, I'm sorry

37:08.160 --> 37:13.760
You got detention now and I looked at them with this look of like, oh, but oh man, you're gonna feel

37:14.800 --> 37:16.240
Pretty bad about this later

37:16.240 --> 37:21.800
I didn't say anything and the detention was I had to like clean up the lunch tables and like wipe them up

37:21.800 --> 37:24.940
and so like I dutifully attended my

37:25.880 --> 37:33.400
My table wiping at lunchtime and then the like vice principal of the school like came up was like you don't you can stop

37:33.400 --> 37:34.680
You don't have to do that

37:34.680 --> 37:40.160
And then I and then I called you Justin and you came to pick me up and I never went back to school

37:48.560 --> 37:51.200
When you get home, especially if your teachers contacted your parent

37:51.200 --> 37:53.040
They might be ticked off to say the least

37:53.040 --> 37:59.720
Start start and this seems like bad advice by asking them how many detentions them and their spouse have ever gotten

37:59.720 --> 38:05.480
Oh, wow, that's so good. Yeah, I flipped a table over on Ashley fillinger

38:05.480 --> 38:12.160
What about what about you father and and what about you mother or father's spouse?

38:12.520 --> 38:14.760
Tell me a mother and or father's spouse

38:15.400 --> 38:18.600
Let them know Einstein even got in trouble every every night then

38:19.440 --> 38:23.640
Table over on lots of other innocent students on Ashley phones your senior

38:23.640 --> 38:30.640
If they won't quit interrupting you tell them respectfully, please let me explain I understand I made a mistake

38:30.640 --> 38:32.640
Could you please let me explain what happened?

38:33.680 --> 38:37.760
Step three. Yeah, step three. Keep your grades up. What step? Oh, yes

38:39.600 --> 38:43.360
Codex 5a do remember to keep your grades up

38:45.000 --> 38:50.960
Step six when explaining don't cry talking your big boy. Slash girl voice. Are they both ready to explain?

38:50.960 --> 38:56.660
How the full story even the mistakes dad dad spouse. It's your mom. Just hey mom

38:57.080 --> 39:02.480
Dad dead spells. No, I do want to say where the fuck do you two get off?

39:03.800 --> 39:05.800
Did you flip?

39:07.560 --> 39:09.560
First tell me of your sins

39:11.600 --> 39:16.000
Yeah, you have to ask your parents to speak on their sins when you're not in trouble

39:16.000 --> 39:22.200
Yeah, that's so essential them to admit to stuff that you can then store away and uses ammunition late

39:22.200 --> 39:23.800
I hope my kids try to drop that on me

39:23.800 --> 39:28.560
So I can inform them that the whole point is to try to make humans that don't fuck up as much as yeah, right?

39:28.560 --> 39:31.480
That's humanity. It's just like incrementally fucking up

39:31.480 --> 39:37.840
Let's see the problem for I would say all of us is that our children have I would say hundreds of hours of examples of us

39:37.840 --> 39:42.320
Fucking up very yeah, right. They're gonna be like, let me go to YouTube. Give me one second

39:42.320 --> 39:46.360
I'll find audio evidence of you doing this exact thing. Oh, what's that?

39:46.360 --> 39:51.160
You're mad at me for flipping a table on to Ashley fit into the third one moment

39:53.560 --> 39:55.080
Be respectful while you're in detention

39:55.080 --> 39:59.280
If you're not that's a good way to get another detention and get grounded because it takes two

39:59.760 --> 40:05.280
To get grounded it takes it takes two detentions to get grounded in pretty much your household

40:05.280 --> 40:10.160
I think we can all agree with that. That's standard. Anything else is a violation the Geneva Convention. Absolutely

40:10.160 --> 40:16.120
Um, that's it. That's it. I think that's a good thing. I had you don't want to break down at your first detention

40:16.840 --> 40:22.600
because it's a sign of weakness and then they'll just want to keep giving you detention because they get off on whatever small amount of

40:22.600 --> 40:26.380
Power that they can hold over over use you developing people, you know

40:26.380 --> 40:31.280
What if you what would you guys think about if they were like you have detention and you were like awesome

40:31.280 --> 40:36.360
Thank you, not since you're not a sarcastic way sincerely like oh, thank you guys. Thank you so much

40:36.360 --> 40:41.800
And they're like what I was like, I love it. I love that's so badass. And then you there will be like keep it up

40:41.800 --> 40:43.800
You don't get more detention. Like I love it

40:45.000 --> 40:47.440
You have a month at attention like make it a year

40:50.760 --> 40:55.040

43:11.860 --> 43:19.800

43:21.140 --> 43:25.380
Dicyanin dye is exclusive only to aura glasses and our goggles

43:26.260 --> 43:29.920
Everyone is able to see auras naturally. Yeah, we know yes

43:30.260 --> 43:37.000
But it can take a long time and effort to be able to do that the aura glasses enable anyone to see auras

43:37.000 --> 43:42.400
Instantly, okay as well as looking at the human aura people use them for ghost hunting

43:43.120 --> 43:49.980
Reiki scanning seeing orders in the environment such as animals and trees. That'd be this would be it might be great for hunting

43:51.040 --> 43:56.160
That's my own editorialization, but it would be so nice to see a deer like I see you fuck

43:56.160 --> 44:00.280
Oh, I mean, let's be a predator can see auras, right? That's

44:00.280 --> 44:05.640
Predator sees the aura at a certain point. I'm seeing the auras of everything though

44:05.640 --> 44:11.560
That might be is there a way to like filter to if I just want to see a squirrel aura or a bird aura

44:12.360 --> 44:16.720
Or am I just seeing all auras all the time. They come with a neat

44:17.520 --> 44:22.780
Official protective pouch cool. This is this is nice. I hear you guys got a lot of questions

44:22.960 --> 44:26.760
Do you see the individual colors in auras through the aura glasses?

44:26.760 --> 44:32.800
And now these glasses are designed to highlight the basic and this is in all caps shape

44:34.360 --> 44:41.160
Okay, surrounding the edge of the physical body up to a few inches and presented as an electric blue color through the lens

45:40.880 --> 45:45.660
I don't know Trav, but we don't wait. I do want to I have even better news

46:01.280 --> 46:04.020
You can do so with aura views aura glasses

46:04.220 --> 46:08.620
I've been a paranormal investigator for over 10 years and I'm part of a ghost hunting group

46:08.620 --> 46:15.980
We visit lots of places and use all sorts of equipment and the aura glasses are by far our favorite as well as seeing

46:15.980 --> 46:22.740
Spirit activity with the aura glasses they can be hooked up to other gear such as we recently mounted one onto our thermal camera

46:22.740 --> 46:28.900
During a visit to an old mansion in England and the guys were literally left open-mouthed from what this thing captured

46:29.540 --> 46:32.780
Absolutely incredible and for what they do. They are not at all expensive

46:33.540 --> 46:35.540
Then now okay, let's pause

46:35.540 --> 46:39.020
There's a lot this guy is a

46:40.420 --> 46:48.420
Member of a ghost hunting group. Yep, and and oh, where did we use them? Oh, yeah, I remember it was some an old

46:49.940 --> 46:54.700
Mansion just that it was no it wasn't just that no it was

46:58.460 --> 47:02.780
Where ghosts come from like how we use the terminology you can hook them up

47:02.780 --> 47:06.860
Which these are a pair of glasses and you put them on a camera you like taped

47:07.340 --> 47:11.680
You like tape the glasses over the lens. Is that just held them up?

47:13.380 --> 47:15.820
Yeah, you can connect them, okay, let's let's move on

47:17.380 --> 47:19.940
The aura glasses work by the use of a groundbreaking

47:20.700 --> 47:26.140
Synthetic photo thermo chemical compound this unique compound is what helps to instantly highlight

47:26.360 --> 47:30.300
Subtle energy fields which otherwise are invisible to the naked eye

47:30.300 --> 47:36.380
I do Reiki treatments and the aura glasses are my main tool for diagnosis and healing

47:36.860 --> 47:41.020
Couldn't do it without them. Honestly, when you look through them, it opens up a whole new world

47:41.700 --> 47:45.380
They're a quick way to sing auras without the need for years of self-development

47:46.180 --> 47:52.940
Now I would like to know with this Reiki practitioner here before you had the org glasses. Yeah, what exactly?

47:52.940 --> 47:58.940
I was just guessing just so it's just guessing before these my smell

47:58.940 --> 48:02.420
I would have wave a hand and be like anything was that

48:03.860 --> 48:06.620
Hey, Justin, wait, wait, wait 12 more seconds

48:11.180 --> 48:17.740
The aura glasses are available to buy from official aura glasses calm and online marketplaces

48:18.500 --> 48:20.500
Okay

48:20.500 --> 48:23.200
I can't just say that I do not like that they invoked

48:23.740 --> 48:28.780
Seeing like a whole new world or whatever it is because then it reminds me too much of that episode of are you afraid of?

48:28.780 --> 48:33.900
The dark where they got some glasses from Sardos and then they could see yes za do

48:34.580 --> 48:40.180
Accent on the dough. No, mr. Accent on the dough sent on the dough. They could see what look

48:41.260 --> 48:46.780
Just watch this fucking episode. No, cuz I just watched it a week. Okay, cuz Cooper's like obsessed

48:46.780 --> 48:52.140
Oh, I I just have that in my head all the time. Oh, and then you heat

48:52.140 --> 48:56.300
You could see them and it was like a whole universe coming through to ours. I don't want that power

48:56.580 --> 49:01.360
No, I think that was the curse of the secret the tale of the secrets back. I believe that's true. Yes. Yes

49:02.340 --> 49:06.920
That one had a horrifying in the other way go back to Paramount Plus and go watch that bad boy

49:07.820 --> 49:13.220
Fucked me. I'm good that one real real unnerving ball. What there's some of those that are like

49:13.220 --> 49:17.500
They'll leave some leave some some fear inside of you. Yeah

49:19.700 --> 49:25.860
Brutal it's brutal. So there's the aura glasses now now now now now now what would you pay? What would you pay?

49:26.980 --> 49:30.960
Now what would you you're gonna see fucking those dude?

49:30.960 --> 49:35.820
I'm gonna say only when I have them on I need prescription glasses unless these aura glasses come in prescription

49:35.820 --> 49:42.020
I know you don't you wouldn't you would pay $20 because to you they're just sunglasses or perhaps in this case fun glasses

49:42.020 --> 49:49.100
You don't think anything is really gonna happen with yeah, I'm asking griffin. Yeah that this seller by the way 99% positive feedback 1200

49:49.900 --> 49:52.900
Transactions, so these things work a hundred percent. No, I'm not

49:53.700 --> 49:59.780
I'm not saying this for the joke. I genuinely think that they cost $69 and 99 cents

50:00.940 --> 50:06.060
Okay. Wow a huge range here. No, you are going to pay

50:06.060 --> 50:14.800
A 39 99 pounds which is about 52 bucks and 17 cents, so

50:15.340 --> 50:21.780
Huh a seal from griffin's point of view a ripoff from Travis's isn't that?

50:22.780 --> 50:29.040
Well beauty is in the eye of the beholder or something if I could just I don't want to move on without

50:29.780 --> 50:32.540
mentioning that there is a hundred percent a

50:32.540 --> 50:38.300
If if these images if this this glasses that that price is a little

50:38.860 --> 50:40.580
much for you to

50:40.580 --> 50:42.580

Okay, I'm sending now

50:48.340 --> 50:57.660
Oh Justin now, this is one I could totally go for

51:05.540 --> 51:07.540
Yeah, what do we see here

51:08.220 --> 51:12.260
The x-ray specs not the classy plastic ones that you might get him up

51:12.260 --> 51:13.580
It's 3d at Disney World

51:13.580 --> 51:20.020
But rather like the paper ones that you might have gotten in the 90s to watch like an episode of Simpsons in 3d

51:20.060 --> 51:24.300
These were delivered in a TV guide exactly. That's what we're looking at here

51:24.300 --> 51:31.540

51:32.140 --> 51:34.240
Yeah, it's like a huge and

51:35.220 --> 51:39.140
Without any context whatsoever. They're at the bottom of the picture five stars

There's just a picture of just five stars on no idea what that's from or out of or

51:47.580 --> 51:53.340
Referencing but hey five stars. Yeah, and what's the price on these? Does it say these are 30 bucks?

51:53.340 --> 51:58.580

Do they have overnight delivery for maybe for June I can I can get them here in time. Sorry. They're coming over from

52:38.460 --> 52:42.860
They're coming over from British, so they would take a while to get across the ocean

52:42.860 --> 52:47.280
It's good too because that also works for what 13th doctor cosplay

52:47.820 --> 52:49.500

52:57.260 --> 53:00.100

53:00.100 --> 53:04.440
You're covered in a three out of the what five modern-day doctors

Yeah, nice, and and you see ghosts five stars

53:09.860 --> 53:11.860

53:13.620 --> 53:15.620
This is of course

53:16.300 --> 53:23.460
You know us. We are we have proven in the last 30 seconds that we make great use of our money

53:23.960 --> 53:25.960
We are responsible

53:25.980 --> 53:28.700
People to give your money to because we're not gonna buy

53:28.700 --> 53:32.460
Goggles, you know we're not gonna buy fake

53:33.300 --> 53:35.300
Ghost-hunting goggles, and you can trust us

53:35.780 --> 53:41.340
We're trustworthy well, and we deserve it. I'll just say we deserve five dollars a month

53:41.340 --> 53:44.780
Okay, if that comes from you or somebody else

53:44.780 --> 53:48.460
I don't care, but I do need my five dollars a month

53:48.460 --> 53:52.540
And I'm sitting here in my studio with my hand literally extended

53:54.620 --> 53:56.620
Open money, please

53:56.620 --> 54:01.080
Um that's not part of the max one drive out by the way. That's just Justin

54:02.500 --> 54:06.860
It does say to speak from the heart, and so I feel like that is what Justin has just done

54:08.060 --> 54:10.100
No, I mean it. It means it means the world

54:10.100 --> 54:17.780
We've been able to do this for most of our adult lives now at this point and that is a not like in in like

54:18.860 --> 54:24.580
Most of the rest of our adult lives. You know what I mean like I fully plan on kicking it at least 12 more years

54:24.580 --> 54:29.860
Can I speak from the heart for a moment? Yeah sure cuz me and Justin doing a real dog shit job of it

54:30.140 --> 54:35.700
One of the things I've missed most over the last two years is going to live shows and going to conventions

54:36.140 --> 54:39.840
Because sometimes when we are doing these shows it's easy to sit at our computers

54:39.840 --> 54:45.700
we record in three different places even and feel very disconnected from the people that we were making these shows for and

54:45.980 --> 54:50.540
Doing the live shows and having the people there in the audience and sharing that moment

54:50.540 --> 54:56.860
We're doing like conventions where we get to do like meet and greets and stuff is a moment where we get to feel

54:57.380 --> 55:00.260
you know connected to the people we're making the show for and

55:01.180 --> 55:02.380
We haven't been able to do that

55:02.380 --> 55:07.420
But we have still done the max fun drives and it's always such a great reminder

55:07.740 --> 55:11.740
Once a year that we're not just like putting these things out into the void

55:12.420 --> 55:13.700
And that you know

55:13.700 --> 55:20.460
We get to make these for people who appreciate them and that we get to kind of share that connection with people and so

55:20.460 --> 55:25.820
I always get really excited around the max fun drive time because it's very energizing for us

55:25.820 --> 55:33.720
And it's it's just always nice to be reminded that the things we make matter to people and I really appreciate it. Yeah

55:34.420 --> 55:38.180
Yeah, absolutely. Listen five bucks a month. You get all the bonus content

55:38.180 --> 55:42.380

55:42.380 --> 55:45.120
You get a cool patch all our patches look really great

55:45.120 --> 55:52.640
$20 a month you pick the creativity kit you pick the hat you get all the other stuff. It's it's uh, it's a sweet

55:52.640 --> 55:55.960
I would say set of stuff. They've got planned for the

55:56.600 --> 56:03.880
Max fun drive gifts this year and we have a bunch of other sweet stuff planned to a lot of stretch goal

56:04.620 --> 56:08.760
content that we have either created or are about to create and

56:08.760 --> 56:14.880
One of them is actually so rotten that I don't want it to happen

56:15.400 --> 56:20.760
So like yes, don't hit the goal. There will be a part of me. That's like whoo. Thank goodness for that

56:22.360 --> 56:24.960
I'm also I just say I'm especially excited

56:24.960 --> 56:27.640
There's a $35 level two with a messenger bag

56:27.640 --> 56:32.800
But there's a hundred dollar a month level that gets you HQ access which includes

56:45.880 --> 56:47.880

56:48.640 --> 56:51.680
My gosh, it's and I've seen her do them

56:51.680 --> 56:57.920
They're all really cool while I like I'm going to be moderating with questions and stuff and I'm really excited about it

56:57.920 --> 57:03.440
It sounds super fun. And we're excited to show people that stuff and like talk with people. It's really a great idea

57:03.440 --> 57:05.120

57:05.120 --> 57:08.500
Maximum fun org slash join is the link to go to please

57:09.080 --> 57:16.280
Please think about joining and helping us out. Maybe you've been listening to our shows for you know, since their inception

57:16.280 --> 57:20.800
But you've always thought I asked somebody else. So somebody else will support them be the chain

57:20.800 --> 57:23.620
They need to be the be the support for us

57:24.200 --> 57:26.200
Please. Thank you

57:27.200 --> 57:29.200
Maximum fun org Ford said

57:29.200 --> 57:36.020
Yeah, but I wanted to end and like do it while people are thinking about it, you know what I mean? Yeah, exactly maximum

57:37.440 --> 57:40.640
I've been learning to drive for the past year making slow but steady progress

57:41.120 --> 57:45.680
Something I found I've been doing is watching how people drive when I'm walking along a road

57:46.000 --> 57:49.360
Looking at how they handle roundabouts awkward junctions, etc

57:49.480 --> 57:54.200
However, a couple of times I've been caught staring at these cars as if I'm glaring at the drivers brothers

57:54.240 --> 57:58.320
How do I communicate? I'm just watching and learning not trying to give them a death glare

57:58.320 --> 58:05.040
That's from slow, but sure in Southampton. I mean, this is easy double thumbs. Oh, yeah, that is good. Great work out there

58:05.680 --> 58:10.160
Dumber thumbs up you're driving. Yeah, this is like we need a great job horn, but

58:10.720 --> 58:16.720
For pedestrians. I actually cars how good they're doing at driving if I were the driver

58:16.720 --> 58:19.600
I would rather see that from someone on the sidewalk than someone

58:20.040 --> 58:26.120
Like in another car next to me because that's the thing. I also do this as a driver where sometimes

58:26.120 --> 58:32.840
Oh you I you know get hyper focused or zone out or something and I'm looking at someone and then I forget like that

58:32.840 --> 58:38.160
I'm not just looking into a void or a television and that's another human being and then they turn and look at me and we

58:38.160 --> 58:43.280
Make eye contact for a minute and if they like parts and open their door and said why are you looking at me?

58:43.280 --> 58:45.280
I would have no answer to that

58:45.280 --> 58:49.360
And so I'd rather look over to the side of the road and just see someone give me a big thumbs up

58:49.760 --> 58:53.720
Make my day if a pedestrian tells you you're doing a great job

58:53.720 --> 59:00.880
Mm-hmm driving that's got to be one of the greatest compliments you can receive because when you're in another car and

59:01.160 --> 59:05.320
You see someone in a car. You're like doing a good job driving. It's like well, yeah

59:05.880 --> 59:08.540
Because if I make an accident and smash into you

59:09.040 --> 59:16.280
The airbags and everything like well, we'll be alright, but a pedestrian is like my life is in your hands right now

59:17.320 --> 59:19.560
Mmm, because the opposite is definitely true

59:19.560 --> 59:26.840
There's a lady in my neighborhood who I often pass and the look that she gives me is the most wither and at first

59:26.840 --> 59:30.680
I thought it was just me but my friends who have like come over people I've talked to you like

59:30.680 --> 59:38.160
Oh, yeah, that woman hates people in cars is the only thing we can determine and so I have drastically oh when I see her I

59:39.080 --> 59:43.600
Become the most textbook like one mile under the speed limit

59:43.600 --> 59:49.640
Like driver I can possibly be and yet still that with it. Well, it's not just her permanent face

59:49.640 --> 59:53.560
Her face changes when she sees me in the car. I don't know what I can do

59:53.920 --> 59:59.920
So you're saying that when she is not present and you're residential neighborhood

59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.000
You absolutely rip shit down the lane

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:05.640
I'm just saying 20 20 miles an hour. That's

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:10.400
Is a joke. It feels like a fucking joke when I do that like

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.780
Anyone behind me is like he's not really doing 20

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:17.140
I mean like I know I know what the science is, but he's not doing 20, right?

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:21.860
We can do 25 and it's right like what's the fucking difference in a school zone?

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:23.860
I get it because their young brains

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:30.800
Aren't developed enough to know like I should not step in front of the big the big steel beast

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:36.940
Right that is that is car and I watch for children if I see that ball roll in the middle of the street

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:42.340
I stop it. I get it. I know what I swerve if I see a ball roll into the street two blocks away

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:48.220
I swerve into a tree. I say not not even gonna fuck around with ya. No way

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:51.220
I see a pinwheel like catching the breeze and but I know I

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:55.920
Get out and punch my own car in the front like the Hulk to save that kid

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.940
I see one of those signs that said that's like slow. There's children here

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:02.420
I will turn around and I will drive in the other

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:07.860
I'll sell my car just so that there's no risk if I know there's kids not in vehicles

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.300
Yeah within eyesight of me

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:14.020
I will stop the car park it get out and walk the rest of the way sometimes

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:19.820
I'll just 10 20 miles without a car just in case because I heard a child's laughter once in that city

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:24.940
Yeah, I mean just got to but in a residential area fucking

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.680
I'm gonna tear that shit up dog

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:27.180
Yeah, dude

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:32.260
The best is if you can get that swirl of leaves or a big splash of puddle and it's just like I'm doing it

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.460
This is a car commercial now, baby. Yeah

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.780
Splashes up on a kid carrying a big tuba in a funny

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:47.860
But then you also feel bags like oh shit, was that a kid was that a kid I thought it was just a sentient

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:53.120
Tuba case as a scarecrow with a tube and they got you they got you. That's how they get you slow down

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:55.940
Justin do you want to say anything about car safety around children?

01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:59.220
Huge important. Okay, huge important. I agree

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.740
huge Jacqueline

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:07.580
Now, you know kids make sure you pay attention to this video is made by Huntington legend Justin McElroy

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:11.940
But you gotta know the rules of the road if you want to take one of these beautiful steel beasts out there

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:20.600
Hi, I'm Justin McElroy from podcasts. You may remember me from podcasts huge important you slow drive around kids. Thanks

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:27.260
What's that you they told me this video had to be 15 minutes. So now I'm gonna show you how to

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:32.620
I got a bunch of nectarines here. I'm gonna squish them and you imagine that's your head in a fucking car

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:36.540
You did but I am gonna eat one of these because I did skip breakfast on my way here

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:41.060
Now this video is gonna start with the 10-minute me unwrapping and eating a nectarine

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:44.500
But you imagine that's a like head blood from a car accident

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:50.340
I'm gonna be a brick wall. Oh this neck green is you my hand is the car. I guess in this scenario

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:54.140
I'm joined by professional footballer Willie refrigerator Perry

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:57.260
He's gonna run into me at 35 miles an hour to show you

01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:01.860
Something about cars and impact and when I'm okay

01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:05.980
And the next readings if you were eating a smaller person at the time of the impact, okay?

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:08.780
Here we go. I'm gonna make fridge Perry step on one of these nectarines

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:11.580
You imagine that's your head cuz you were trying to Doug you while driving

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:17.340
Okay, here we go. Wait, where are you going fridge? I remember one of those videos where they were like

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:23.860
Um it with Rex are so like forceful and terrible

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.220
That danger lurks all around

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:32.100
they said I once came upon a scene where a box of Kleenex in a head-on collision had

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:40.400
Rocketed up from where they were being laid on the backseat in the window had rocketed forward and like killed somebody and it's like

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.980
What do you want me to do with this? I mean step one don't put your Kleenex back there

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:52.220
so I can't okay like I took the Kleenex down but like are you really trying to like send me into a spiral of like

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:56.340
I don't nobody fucking knows man box of Kleenex. That's not you could go out

01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.420
Final destination movie and be like don't smoke

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:08.080
In your car near a sewer pipe on the opposite end of a field where somebody is grilling some chicken

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.580
Or else it'll explode and the fence will go through you and cut you into a bunch of pieces

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:15.540
It's like I've been there all been there

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:19.140
Do you guys ever think about final destination and wonder if it okay?

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:24.980
Wonder if it was just a PSA on behalf of truck drivers who have logs on the back of their truck

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:29.800
And it's just like the whole movie was paid for by those drivers to keep people from tailgating them

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:33.260
Yeah, that was I think the biggest result of that movie. Yeah

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:33.580
I mean

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:39.340
I was already pretty scared of a truck carrying a bunch of logs on a place that logs aren't supposed to be like we destroyed

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:44.380
The logs so we could put down a road there right and I don't like that. The logs are kind of coming back

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:51.380
Yeah, but yeah that I mean it was an effective sort of marketing tool for the anti log sort of Lobby

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:56.180
