00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.880
Hello, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.880 --> 00:52.640
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:54.080 --> 00:57.520
This is your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Are we really doing the intro?

00:57.520 --> 01:04.640
Uh, baby, uh, Griffin, don't sew yourself short. Baby brother and mouth sounds aficionado.

01:04.640 --> 01:09.280
Okay, but it's just like, I sometimes I say things when we're like scrambling to think of

01:09.280 --> 01:17.360
an introduction, and then there's an earned period of astonished silence,

01:17.360 --> 01:21.040
and then we decide to do something else. But you guys are sure you want this one?

01:21.040 --> 01:27.200
Well, Griffin, why don't you walk it out, take this horse out for a trot, and see how she gallops?

01:27.200 --> 01:32.880
Let's hop in. Let's check out the mileage on this bad boy. I was just telling the fellas,

01:34.800 --> 01:38.880
and there's a lot going on. Oscar's politics, and this is the one we decided to do.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.080
Yeah, roll it out.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.520
Other ones aren't funny. This one's funny.

01:41.520 --> 01:45.360
Well, I got this new mouth noise I can make that I just found out about.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.080
Let's hear it.

01:46.080 --> 01:49.040
And you know, I've made such a big deal out of it now that I'm almost certain

01:49.040 --> 01:53.120
I'm not going to be able to do it again, and that's going to be hugely embarrassing for me.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.560
Oh, absolutely.

01:54.560 --> 01:59.440
All right, here goes nothing.

01:59.440 --> 02:02.960
Now, Griffin, as you pointed out before we started recording, this is an audio medium.

02:02.960 --> 02:07.680
Could you describe visually what we might be seeing watching you?

02:07.680 --> 02:10.960
Well, it would be impressive. You'd see just sort of my left cheek

02:11.680 --> 02:21.120
convulsing wildly as I created a sort of wet sort of meat slap sound

02:21.120 --> 02:27.440
of my cheek against, nope, see, it's hard to do it sometimes.

02:27.440 --> 02:32.480
Griffin, if you were doing Foley, what would you say that this sound is?

02:32.480 --> 02:39.040
Because I would say that this sound is recreating perhaps a nude person with a penis skydiving.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.920
Yeah, just sort of flipping and flapping around in the wind.

02:43.920 --> 02:50.240
Yeah, this is it, isn't it, guys? This is the last thing to joke about.

02:50.240 --> 02:55.120
Yeah, this is, we've joked about all the other things, we've done jokes about all other things,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.440
this is the last thing we haven't done jokes about.

02:59.440 --> 03:05.040
It says right here, 499, then it just says Griffin mouth sound.

03:05.040 --> 03:10.000
Yeah, I mean, it might be juice, but can I say something?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.120
That sounds like the jealousy talking that you can't do this.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.040
No, it seems like this is the end of it.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.720
Justin, can you see the mouth sounds?

03:16.720 --> 03:20.400
I gotta say juice green's not a great color on you, bud.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.360
Nope, that's not it at all. Nope, that's not it either.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.360
I can kind of hum and whistle at the same time.

03:27.360 --> 03:29.360
No, that's not anything, we've done that one before.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.400
Episode 302 is all about Travis's whistling noise.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.520
Justin learned how to do that funny clicking noise back in 103,

03:35.520 --> 03:38.320
like this is the last sound, Justin's got a point here.

03:39.840 --> 03:43.680
I'm not saying it's the last sound, I'm saying this is the last joke.

03:43.680 --> 03:47.920
Joke, this is the last one, and I mean, it's not even,

03:48.880 --> 03:54.160
we used a lot of our best material early on and that's fine, but this is it.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.600
Yeah, I think it sounds like the inside of a cat while it's purring,

03:57.600 --> 03:59.840
you know what I mean, like if you could really hear in it.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.360
Or maybe a thin steak in front of a high-powered fan.

04:03.360 --> 04:07.040
That's a good one, yeah, or like, yeah, that's probably what it is.

04:07.040 --> 04:12.240
Well, okay, wait, Griffin, I'm gonna set it up like this is an old-timey radio drama,

04:12.240 --> 04:15.920
and you just cue the noise when you think I'm setting you up, you ready?

04:15.920 --> 04:16.400
Yeah, all right.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.160
Hold on, Justin, if you want to play along in the bit, too,

04:20.160 --> 04:22.640
and play in the space with your two brothers who are out on the playground

04:22.640 --> 04:23.760
and having a lot of fun together.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.520
My mouth hurts, I have a sore on my mouth, okay?

04:28.560 --> 04:31.760
We've all got fucking sores on our mouths, Justin.

04:31.760 --> 04:36.480
You can be maybe the femme fatale in this radio drama I'm creating.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.040
Just play, we just want to fucking play with you, dude,

04:39.040 --> 04:41.120
because you're our brother and our co-host.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.520
Okay, all right, let's get the drama started.

04:43.520 --> 04:46.000
I'll do the opening narration, okay?

04:46.000 --> 04:50.640
Well, starting out like any other day in my detective office that I have,

04:51.280 --> 04:56.000
and I pop my feet up on the desk, and there he was in the doorway,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.800
making a sound that sounded like this.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.000
I can't do it if I'm smiling.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.800
Okay, Justin, I'm sorry, hey, pause, time out real quick.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.320
I just ramped up to it, Trav.

05:08.320 --> 05:11.760
I know, but Justin, maybe you've never listened to radio dramas before.

05:11.760 --> 05:18.480
Rarely is the fully set up as now listen to a character make a noise.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.680
That's actually bullshit.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.840
There's a lot of those radio dramas where it's like,

05:21.840 --> 05:25.360
and the clumping of hooves was very loud, and it was like this.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.880
That's fair, Justin, but you've proved my point,

05:28.880 --> 05:31.680
because what you did not say is then someone walked in

05:31.680 --> 05:34.240
making a sound like the clumping of hooves.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.520
No, they were making this sound.

05:37.520 --> 05:42.880
My newest client at Slim Leeds Detective Agency.

05:42.880 --> 05:43.840
Oh, I like that.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.800
If you let me get to it, it was the good name of it,

05:47.600 --> 05:49.920
and that was my next client.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.160
Let me please pick the audio drama back up,

05:52.160 --> 05:54.480
and yes, this is going to last the entire episode before you ask aloud.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.120
Are you going to say something about wet jerky to establish the sound?

05:57.120 --> 05:58.240
I think that would be good.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.480
Hey, can I see if I can do it with my right cheek?

06:00.480 --> 06:00.640
Yeah.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.000
Nope, I can't.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.880
No, that's much more of a broken down jalopy.

06:07.520 --> 06:08.720
Can we start doing the show?

06:08.720 --> 06:09.200
Is that enough-

06:09.200 --> 06:15.040
If Travis, if Griffin making these bizarro horse noises

06:15.040 --> 06:19.600
is making the hair on the back of your neck stand up,

06:19.600 --> 06:21.760
we call that nay SMR.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.800
Oh no, that's the last joke.

06:24.800 --> 06:28.480
That was the last joke, if one might even call it that.

06:28.480 --> 06:32.160
So there he was making the sound, see, with his voice,

06:32.160 --> 06:39.280
and he said, I have a case for, well, no, you would say to Slim Leads.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.040
Hey, I've got a case for you.

06:43.040 --> 06:51.360
I do, hold on, and my dog is sick.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.440
And also, hey, I'm here, the guy who set up the radio drama.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.840
I guess I'm sweeping the floor outside the hallway.

06:57.840 --> 07:01.840
We've been talking to the casting director on this one.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.600
Yeah, but I'm the casting director.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.320
Sure, but this happens a lot in this business,

07:06.320 --> 07:09.360
is that you got boxed out a little bit.

07:09.360 --> 07:12.000
Damn it, I can't believe I cut myself out of this.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.400
It's your look, honestly, Trav, it's just not right for this one.

07:16.400 --> 07:21.360
We had Justin come in and sometimes an actor just really takes a role-

07:21.360 --> 07:23.120
Because he was supposed to play the femme fatale

07:23.120 --> 07:24.560
and he took over, I was gonna be the detective.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.960
He took over, yeah, he's got the look.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.160
Yeah.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.680
What were these two talking about?

07:29.680 --> 07:31.440
I couldn't make a hill of beans out of it.

07:31.440 --> 07:34.160
He's so in it, he's so fucking in it.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.040
I didn't know what this had to do with me,

07:37.040 --> 07:39.360
but I could smell mystery was the case.

07:40.960 --> 07:41.680
He's good.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.440
So what brings you to Slim Leeds, huh?

07:51.040 --> 07:52.720
Cigarette, cigarette, cigarette.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.560
Hey, what's our first question?

07:54.560 --> 07:56.720
All right, here's my first question.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.640
What brings you in, what's the case?

07:58.640 --> 08:00.560
I'm ready to get cracking.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.880
You know, in retrospect, I don't think I sent out the questions.

08:03.680 --> 08:04.640
Tough guy, huh?

08:05.680 --> 08:06.480
Playing tough.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.000
Oh my God.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.160
I'm about to send out a few questions.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.080
Here's my first one.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.520
Ah, you just punched, you punched me in the mouth.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.880
That's not a question at all.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.200
Yeah, a little chin question.

08:19.200 --> 08:23.520
And you, you, the smart looking one over there.

08:23.520 --> 08:24.400
You're giving me a hug.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.280
Now I'm hugging you again.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.440
Oh, oh, I feel better.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.800
It's less threatening now.

08:30.800 --> 08:31.360
Oh, it's so nice.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.480
Yeah, see?

08:32.480 --> 08:34.640
Unconscious guy on the floor, snap out of it.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.080
Oh, the noise persists.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.880
Hey, it's me, the Plumber Gamer.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.200
You gotta call a bunch of pipes, make it a funny noise.

08:45.840 --> 08:46.800
I can't do it anymore.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.360
I formed this callus on my cheek

08:49.360 --> 08:50.800
that's made it impossible to make the noise.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.520
I'm gonna read the first question, if Justin does it.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.600
I don't have the questions.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.960
I just sent them.

08:56.960 --> 09:01.120
Justin, there's a lively security officer at my office

09:01.120 --> 09:04.640
who walks around and has a rhyming nickname for everything

09:04.640 --> 09:09.200
like Mrs. Brown from downtown or Mr. John who's rocking on.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.320
I got too depressed by this person to continue

09:12.320 --> 09:14.240
with the great character of Slim Leads,

09:14.240 --> 09:18.160
but Slim Leads will return later in the podcast at some time.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.160
That's a breakout, we might have to do a spinoff.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.640
When they come to me, they just say,

09:24.640 --> 09:28.560
hey, Zach, I don't have any beef with the security officer

09:28.560 --> 09:30.000
and I've been here for over six months.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.920
What can I do to get a great nickname

09:31.920 --> 09:34.240
that's from default name in DC?

09:34.240 --> 09:36.320
Yeah, there's not a lot of words that rhyme with Zach.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.800
Yep, Zach Jack Nicholson.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.080
Here comes a sack full of Zach snacks.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.120
There's a lot of good ones that you could do.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.400
So you want this to happen to you?

09:49.440 --> 09:51.840
Hey, you want this?

09:51.840 --> 09:54.560
You want to be Nut-Zach like you want that?

09:55.280 --> 09:57.600
Griffin, why would that be it?

09:57.600 --> 10:00.160
The other one or Mrs. Brown from downtown

10:00.160 --> 10:02.560
and John who's got it going on and Nut-Zach.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.480
He clearly doesn't like you.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.160
So if I say, hey, I want a nickname too,

10:08.160 --> 10:10.480
he's gonna be like, okay, Nut-Zach.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.960
And then he's gonna give you Nuggy

10:14.000 --> 10:17.040
and that's not gonna be any good.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.560
I don't know why you would want that.

10:18.560 --> 10:23.560
I don't, I had a gym teacher that called me macaroni

10:24.560 --> 10:26.960
and I fucking hated that dude.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.880
Yeah, dude, I used to get that, it's the worst.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.080
I think that this security guard

10:34.080 --> 10:36.000
has come up with mnemonic devices

10:36.000 --> 10:39.280
to remember people that he thinks

10:39.280 --> 10:41.600
or they think are shady.

10:42.800 --> 10:46.960
So maybe Zach just seems like a real upstanding individual

10:46.960 --> 10:48.960
and the security guard's not worried

10:48.960 --> 10:51.200
about remembering anything about Zach.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.000
Or he's the only Zach.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.160
Zach, and he's not, I don't want to call you Zach,

10:56.160 --> 10:57.200
Zach, the only Zach.

10:57.200 --> 10:57.840
Right.

10:57.840 --> 10:58.880
The prime Zach.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.920
Either one of those are great nicknames.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.000
If I was called Zach, Zach, the only Zach,

11:04.560 --> 11:05.920
I would love that.

11:05.920 --> 11:06.320
That'd be good.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.200
That would be good.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.520
There's a lot of, and you know what, Zach?

11:09.520 --> 11:11.600
You really should count your blessings

11:11.600 --> 11:13.680
because there's probably a lot of people

11:13.680 --> 11:17.760
that can't even, that aren't eligible

11:18.480 --> 11:19.440
for this treatment.

11:20.720 --> 11:21.680
Poor Exemplet.

11:23.040 --> 11:23.920
There's a Philip.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.240
What are you going to do with that?

11:26.240 --> 11:26.960
Yep.

11:26.960 --> 11:27.760
Here comes Philip.

11:28.800 --> 11:29.680
Philip the Tank.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.840
There's nothing that you can do with that.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.440
So you should at least celebrate

11:33.440 --> 11:36.640
that you could one day earn a Nutsac.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.040
Hey Griffin, did my microphone cut out

11:39.040 --> 11:40.400
when I said Philip the Tank?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.200
I'm just making sure because I thought

11:43.200 --> 11:44.240
that was a really good one

11:44.240 --> 11:45.520
and you didn't acknowledge it at all

11:45.520 --> 11:46.720
and I thought maybe my microphone

11:46.720 --> 11:48.240
might've gone staticky for a minute.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.680
No, I just didn't think it was funny.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.000
Philip the Tank, right?

11:54.000 --> 11:57.360
Because it sounds like you would fill up a tank.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.000
It might just be a brain thing

12:00.000 --> 12:01.280
that I've got going on.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.240
Oh, okay.

12:02.240 --> 12:02.480
Yeah.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.400
Zach Braff.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.800
Now maybe it is Zach Braff.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.480
Zach Braff, did you write us a question?

12:10.640 --> 12:12.400
That's why he doesn't need to nickname

12:12.400 --> 12:14.960
because it would be absolutely wild

12:14.960 --> 12:16.960
to think that he wouldn't instantly recognize

12:16.960 --> 12:18.800
the star of Alex Inc and Scrubs.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.400
Hey, can I fucking lay it out on the line

12:22.400 --> 12:24.160
for you here, Zachary?

12:26.080 --> 12:27.360
You don't know his name.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.640
You wicked don't know the security officer's name

12:34.640 --> 12:35.920
or else you wouldn't have called him

12:35.920 --> 12:38.160
this security officer.

12:38.160 --> 12:39.920
So that's for damn sure.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.080
Okay Griffin, though, counterpoint.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.520
Zach wouldn't have written an email

12:43.520 --> 12:47.120
that was like, hey, there's this guy Ted

12:47.120 --> 12:48.400
who doesn't know my name.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.560
He's not gonna dox this poor fool.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.360
But there'll be so cavalier

12:53.360 --> 12:54.880
about Ms. Brown from downtown.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.040
I'm just saying you don't know

12:57.040 --> 12:58.080
the security officer's name.

12:58.080 --> 13:03.360
If you do say their name is Craig.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.520
You can just be like, Craig, Craig,

13:05.520 --> 13:06.960
to the bitter dregs.

13:06.960 --> 13:11.200
And then you know that you're safe

13:11.200 --> 13:12.480
to play with.

13:12.480 --> 13:16.480
Oh, so maybe you're going to initiate play.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.080
You gotta start the play

13:18.080 --> 13:19.760
in a safe, comfortable place

13:19.760 --> 13:23.520
so that Craig feels safe to play.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.160
I like that.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.920
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

13:26.720 --> 13:27.680
I wish you would.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.040
This one was sent in by Emma Cant.

13:29.040 --> 13:29.680
Thank you, Emma.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.560
It's Yahoo Answers user Noah who asks,

13:34.240 --> 13:37.120
is Buzz Aldrin allowed to climb

13:37.120 --> 13:42.000
into the exhibits in the Air and Space Museum?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.600
If Buzz Aldrin wanted to go

13:43.600 --> 13:45.520
to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum

13:45.520 --> 13:46.480
in Washington, DC

13:47.440 --> 13:50.000
and climb into the original Apollo 11 capsule

13:50.000 --> 13:51.360
that they have on display,

13:51.360 --> 13:53.280
could the museum staff stop him?

13:53.840 --> 13:55.600
Regular people can't do this in museums,

13:55.600 --> 13:57.440
but he's the whole reason it's in the museum

13:57.440 --> 13:58.400
in the first place.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.480
This question also applies to other situations

14:00.480 --> 14:02.320
like if Leonardo da Vinci was alive

14:02.320 --> 14:03.280
and he went to the Louvre,

14:03.280 --> 14:07.440
and took the Mona Lisa off the wall

14:07.440 --> 14:08.400
and walked out with it,

14:08.400 --> 14:09.680
could he do that?

14:09.680 --> 14:11.200
Okay, now these are two different questions.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.960
These are two different questions.

14:12.960 --> 14:13.760
Wildly different questions.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.080
Unless once Buzz Aldrin got inside

14:16.080 --> 14:17.680
the Apollo 11 capsule

14:17.680 --> 14:20.080
and he blasted off with it out of the museum

14:20.080 --> 14:21.440
to take it to his backyard

14:21.440 --> 14:23.280
where he would charge children $5

14:24.160 --> 14:26.800
to climb inside and experience a space adventure.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.200
I don't think that that's the same thing though.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.200
Now, could Buzz Aldrin go in

14:31.200 --> 14:33.760
and just take a moon rock?

14:33.760 --> 14:35.200
Was it his?

14:35.200 --> 14:36.880
This is my gift to you,

14:36.880 --> 14:37.840
I'm gonna take this back now.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.320
I let you all hold my moon rock for a while,

14:41.520 --> 14:43.600
but I need it for a project at school.

14:43.600 --> 14:44.560
Was that an option?

14:44.560 --> 14:47.680
Do you think that he had like one for them

14:47.680 --> 14:49.680
and he had like another one

14:49.680 --> 14:51.600
bolting out of his space pocket

14:51.600 --> 14:53.600
and he's like, no, this one's for Buzz.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.000
I wanna keep this weird moon rock for myself.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.200
Okay, first of all,

14:57.200 --> 14:58.720
Buzz Aldrin would swallow it

14:58.720 --> 15:00.720
if he was trying to smuggle it, come on.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.400
Yeah, that's true.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.880
And that's how he became Moon Man.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.600
Now, great hero.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.120
Here's why I think these are two wildly different questions.

15:11.840 --> 15:15.280
Because if Leonardo da Vinci was alive today,

15:15.280 --> 15:17.760
I think he could do whatever the fuck you wanted.

15:17.760 --> 15:18.400
Yeah.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.080
Right, he's Leonardo da Vinci,

15:20.080 --> 15:22.000
maybe a zombie,

15:22.000 --> 15:23.280
but at the very least,

15:23.280 --> 15:24.560
he's Leonardo da Vinci

15:24.560 --> 15:26.880
and he's like 800 years old or whatever.

15:26.880 --> 15:27.200
Right.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.400
Right, Buzz Aldrin.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.480
He's only 90, so.

15:30.480 --> 15:30.800
Right.

15:31.520 --> 15:31.760
Nice try.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.560
I don't think,

15:32.560 --> 15:34.080
like, do you think,

15:34.880 --> 15:36.800
like say Tom Banksy,

15:37.840 --> 15:39.120
the street artist,

15:39.120 --> 15:40.480
walked into your museum and said,

15:40.480 --> 15:42.240
that's mine, give it back?

15:42.240 --> 15:44.480
No, okay, but this is foolishness

15:44.480 --> 15:46.160
and I'm gonna curtail it right now

15:46.160 --> 15:47.920
because we're not talking about stealing.

15:47.920 --> 15:48.800
Thank God.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.480
I've been to the Air and Space Museum,

15:50.480 --> 15:51.760
it's pretty radical.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.800
You go there,

15:52.800 --> 15:54.640
you see these big spaceships

15:54.640 --> 15:56.000
and there's only like one of them

15:56.000 --> 15:58.800
that they let you actually like get in.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.960
Yes, and it doesn't go anywhere.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.240
It doesn't fucking go anywhere,

16:02.240 --> 16:04.000
you can't touch the steering wheel

16:04.000 --> 16:05.360
or the go pedals,

16:05.360 --> 16:06.800
like it's dog shit,

16:06.800 --> 16:07.440
but whatever,

16:07.440 --> 16:09.360
like it's the closest you get

16:09.360 --> 16:12.080
to that big, beautiful, starry sky.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.320
But if you're Buzz Aldrin

16:15.200 --> 16:18.000
and it's your essentially space car

16:18.880 --> 16:20.560
that you drove to outer space

16:20.560 --> 16:23.120
and landed on the fucking moon?

16:23.840 --> 16:24.240
Yeah.

16:24.240 --> 16:24.480
Yeah.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.400
I do not see,

16:26.960 --> 16:28.080
I do not see,

16:28.080 --> 16:30.880
okay, putting aside the question of legality,

16:30.880 --> 16:32.480
is there anyone working

16:32.480 --> 16:34.640
at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum

16:34.640 --> 16:36.960
that would have the fucking gall

16:36.960 --> 16:39.680
to say, hey, Buzz Aldrin?

16:40.720 --> 16:43.760
Get out of the rocket ship, Buzz.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.840
No, and I can tell you right now,

16:45.840 --> 16:47.360
all Buzz Aldrin would have to do

16:47.360 --> 16:48.080
is to say,

16:48.080 --> 16:49.840
while looking in the eye of this person,

16:49.840 --> 16:51.280
I'm allowed to do this.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.400
I can do this.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.480
Smithsonian said I could do this.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.680
And you would say,

16:55.680 --> 16:56.640
I don't even think you would need

16:56.640 --> 16:57.840
to invoke the name of Smithsonian,

16:57.840 --> 16:58.800
I think you could just say,

16:58.800 --> 17:00.400
I'm allowed to do this.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.280
And no living human being would say,

17:03.280 --> 17:05.520
no, you're not, Buzz Aldrin.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.480
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.680
I'm not stealing it.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.760
I left my wallet in here

17:09.760 --> 17:11.600
back in like 1969

17:11.600 --> 17:13.280
when I plonked this shit down

17:13.280 --> 17:14.400
on the lunar surface.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.000
So like-

17:16.000 --> 17:18.960
Bad news, you little dipshit.

17:18.960 --> 17:19.760
I gotta go back.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.000
I promised.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.920
I promised the moon lords.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.040
Oh, I didn't, shit.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.640
I should have mentioned that actually.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.640
I checked the book out from the moon library

17:28.640 --> 17:29.760
and I need to return it.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.080
The fines are piling up.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.120
You can use any excuse.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.560
And that's why you don't have to use any,

17:36.560 --> 17:37.120
I don't think,

17:37.120 --> 17:39.040
because they're just gonna assume

17:39.040 --> 17:40.320
you have moon books

17:40.320 --> 17:41.280
that you need to return

17:41.280 --> 17:41.840
or something like that.

17:41.840 --> 17:42.800
Yeah, they're just gonna assume

17:42.800 --> 17:45.680
you gotta hanker in for some moon chow.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.680
We are telling a lot of fun jokes

17:47.680 --> 17:49.360
about the moon and space right now,

17:49.360 --> 17:50.480
but I do not believe

17:50.480 --> 17:52.400
there's somebody working at that museum

17:52.400 --> 17:54.400
that would tell 90 year old Buzz Aldrin

17:54.400 --> 17:55.840
to get the fuck out of the spaceship.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.520
This is what I'm saying.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.320
Yeah, but you are gonna need a CID, right?

18:00.320 --> 18:03.040
Cause you probably have a grip of old men

18:03.040 --> 18:04.960
trying to get in that rocket all the time.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.080
You're gonna need a CID on that.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.520
I'm Buzz Aldrin.

18:11.120 --> 18:11.760
I heard you.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.240
Haunted Doll Watch.

18:16.240 --> 18:16.960
Hi, Haunted Doll Watch.

18:16.960 --> 18:17.440
What do you think about that?

18:17.440 --> 18:18.400
I feel good about it.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.720
It's been a little bit bum bum.

18:21.680 --> 18:22.720
In sort of our,

18:22.720 --> 18:24.640
the closest we're gonna get to a haunted doll

18:24.640 --> 18:26.400
named after our show, Bum Bum.

18:26.400 --> 18:26.960
Oh, okay.

18:26.960 --> 18:27.520
I didn't know.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.120
I thought that you had just sort of said

18:29.120 --> 18:32.800
like a fun little onomatopoetic sort of like,

18:32.800 --> 18:34.960
like a drum leading us into the bit.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.400
It's called Bum Bum?

18:36.400 --> 18:37.920
I thought it was like a news sound,

18:37.920 --> 18:39.520
like bum bum bum, like that.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.880
This one's called Bum Bum?

18:40.880 --> 18:43.280
Okay, is this Tom Green's Haunted Doll or what's up?

18:44.480 --> 18:45.760
No, he's Bum Bum,

18:45.760 --> 18:47.760
the haunted clown doll vessel.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.560
Super freaky.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.720
And I have a, actually, before I get into this,

18:50.720 --> 18:51.680
I do wanna ask you guys,

18:52.240 --> 18:53.600
there's nine bids.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.360
There's 26 minutes left.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.080
What's the highest bid?

18:56.080 --> 18:58.480
What do you think, 1750?

18:58.480 --> 18:59.120
That's not bad.

18:59.760 --> 19:00.800
Should I try to get in here?

19:00.800 --> 19:02.400
Well, let's hear the descriptors.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.280
We have time to read.

19:04.080 --> 19:04.400
Okay.

19:04.400 --> 19:04.960
Give us the info.

19:04.960 --> 19:05.920
We'll make a decision at the end.

19:05.920 --> 19:06.960
This is like a,

19:06.960 --> 19:08.400
we've turned this into a reality show.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.640
Yeah, we can play along at home.

19:10.640 --> 19:11.600
God, don't even.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.920
Bum Bum, the haunted clown doll vessel.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.600
You're purchasing a tangible doll.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.160
Okay.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.480
He is a 21 inch plush doll.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.760
Meet Bum Bum, the haunted clown doll.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.560
Can I, we've done a lot of haunted dolls.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.640
Is this our first plush haunted doll?

19:26.640 --> 19:28.480
Usually they are like a porcelain.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.240
Porcelain, yeah, creepier.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.240
This one's pretty bad though.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.840
This one's pretty creepy.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.920
So Bum Bum is a haunted clown doll.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.040
And here's the description.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.600
I know this will sound so weird,

19:39.600 --> 19:41.600
but I can honestly not tell you

19:41.600 --> 19:43.120
where in the world this doll came from.

19:45.760 --> 19:46.080
Okay.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.120
Good story.

19:47.120 --> 19:51.280
I have asked everyone that comes in and out of my house,

19:51.280 --> 19:54.480
if they brought it and put it in my office as a joke

19:54.480 --> 19:55.920
and everyone denies it.

19:55.920 --> 19:56.960
I bet you're fun.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.960
I bet you're a fun person to talk to.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.400
Excuse me, do you have a second?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.760
I have a couple of questions for you.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.600
I don't know how we got here.

20:04.640 --> 20:05.360
That's what it says.

20:05.360 --> 20:05.920
Oh, okay.

20:05.920 --> 20:06.960
Not how he got here.

20:07.680 --> 20:08.960
I don't know how we got here.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.640
Neither do I.

20:10.640 --> 20:11.760
Trisha, neither do I.

20:12.320 --> 20:14.160
But I definitely want to get rid of him.

20:14.160 --> 20:14.720
Okay.

20:14.720 --> 20:18.080
I think he may have been passed around a lot.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.320
He is not.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.040
I don't enjoy that verbiage at all.

20:23.920 --> 20:28.320
He is not in perfect condition as you can see from the pics.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.320
Take that, Bum Bum.

20:31.040 --> 20:34.800
Someone has rode Bum Bum hard and put him down wet.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.080
Yeah.

20:36.080 --> 20:39.840
Bum Bum has had what I would describe as a challenging life.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.520
Bum Bum is not in perfect condition.

20:42.080 --> 20:45.840
I have given him, or the spirit that resides in him,

20:46.560 --> 20:48.480
the name Bum Bum.

20:48.480 --> 20:49.280
Because I hate him.

20:49.280 --> 20:52.560
I named it because I want to be murdered in my sleep.

20:53.440 --> 20:57.840
I named him that because in the middle of the night,

20:57.840 --> 21:01.840
I will hear a sort of chanting and a very low weird voice saying

21:01.840 --> 21:05.760
Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum and then laughter.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.160
So fucking maybe Tom Green actually.

21:08.160 --> 21:08.480
Yeah.

21:09.040 --> 21:12.640
This is like why our son's original name was Guh.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.280
Just because that's the sound he likes to make

21:15.280 --> 21:17.120
and that's how names do work sometimes.

21:17.120 --> 21:17.280
Yeah.

21:17.280 --> 21:21.120
Because almost every morning when I come down into my office,

21:21.120 --> 21:22.880
he is on top of one of my other dolls.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.960
Do you have any kids in your house, Mayhaps?

21:28.080 --> 21:30.240
He has also pushed things off the shelf

21:30.240 --> 21:34.480
and has made strange laughing sounds when I'm not in the room.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.920
Well, you didn't call him ha ha, did you?

21:36.880 --> 21:37.120
No.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.000
And also made strange laughing sounds

21:40.000 --> 21:42.640
is maybe the wildest way of saying laughs.

21:42.640 --> 21:45.920
Like we're just, okay, not an efficiency of language.

21:45.920 --> 21:49.600
I honestly don't think my other spirits like him very much.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.080
Oh.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.080
I just need to be honest about that.

21:52.080 --> 21:52.640
Wait, hold on.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.200
I honestly don't think my other spirits like him very much.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.800
I just need to be honest about that.

21:58.800 --> 21:59.360
Finally.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.720
Let me get this off my chest.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.560
Yeah, he seems like kind of a predator.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.240
I don't really enjoy Bum Bum.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.600
I can see Trisha doesn't either.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.040
I'm guessing that if you had time to spend with him

22:11.040 --> 22:14.320
and figure out what the backstory of the spirit that resides in him is,

22:14.320 --> 22:17.920
then he probably would settle down and act better.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.520
Yeah, Trisha, it sounds like you're taking

22:19.520 --> 22:21.440
some pretty fucking big logical leaps

22:21.440 --> 22:23.040
to get this thing out of your house, huh?

22:23.040 --> 22:25.280
I also, I love it in these haunted dolls

22:25.280 --> 22:28.320
when you can see where the seller remembered

22:28.320 --> 22:29.920
like they're trying to sell something

22:30.560 --> 22:32.720
where they're like, yeah, this doll really blew out.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.800
Do you want someone to buy this?

22:34.800 --> 22:37.120
You know, if you really took the time with Bum Bum,

22:37.760 --> 22:41.360
I bet he'd come around and be a great friend.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.880
A great friend.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.440
At this time, I have too many dolls

22:45.440 --> 22:48.160
and cannot spend enough time with all of them.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.680
I hear that though.

22:49.680 --> 22:50.400
I hear that.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.680
That's a tough, that's a tough scenario.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.400
Most of these dolls do not need so much attention,

22:57.120 --> 22:59.280
but for him to settle down, he will need it.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.800
Handle with care.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.440
And then it has a thing about-

23:03.440 --> 23:05.040
This is fake bullshit.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.480
This is fake bullshit.

23:06.480 --> 23:07.360
Now here's what's up.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.200
1750.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.760
Let me go ahead and crank $20 down on it

23:11.760 --> 23:13.520
and you all can tell me when, okay.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.560
That was not high enough.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.400
I've been instantly outbid.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.320
I can do 24, 25, 26.

23:18.320 --> 23:18.960
What do y'all think?

23:18.960 --> 23:20.480
I think you should do 26

23:20.480 --> 23:22.960
because frankly, Cooper's birthday's coming up.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.240
Outbid.

23:24.240 --> 23:25.600
Damn it, 30.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.560
So, wow.

23:26.560 --> 23:27.600
People, you think 30?

23:27.600 --> 23:29.520
Don't let Bum Bum slip through your fingers.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.960
Cut your losses, Juice.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.040
30, no.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.240
I've been outbid again.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.000
I am driving up the price of this.

23:36.000 --> 23:36.240
Yes.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.400
This doll.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.040
$36?

23:39.040 --> 23:41.440
Yes, that got it.

23:44.000 --> 23:44.480
What are you gonna-

23:44.480 --> 23:46.160
Oh wait, I don't want it.

23:46.800 --> 23:47.520
Oh no.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.920
Well, looks like we got ourselves a new mascot.

23:49.920 --> 23:50.720
That was so fast.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.280
It should be here before our show in Cincinnati.

23:53.280 --> 23:53.600
Okay.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.320
So I can throw it into the crowd.

23:56.320 --> 23:59.120
Throw Bum Bum out there into the crowd.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.280
I'm just gonna raise my maximum bid

24:01.280 --> 24:02.320
because now I really want him.

24:02.320 --> 24:09.360
$5,000.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.960
Your eBay just emailed me.

24:10.960 --> 24:11.840
Your bid's winning now,

24:11.840 --> 24:15.040
but watch out for competition for Bum Bum.

24:15.040 --> 24:18.240
The haunted club doll vessel's super freaky.

24:19.440 --> 24:20.560
He is super freaky.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.120
He's a nasty little doll.

24:21.120 --> 24:23.120
He's a nasty little nasty boy.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.440
And you don't take home the mother.

24:25.440 --> 24:26.880
So I just raised that bid one more time.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.240
Now I feel comfortable.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.840
I still want to get an email during the show

24:29.840 --> 24:31.360
that's like Bum Bum is gone

24:31.360 --> 24:32.720
and I have to interrupt the entire show.

24:32.720 --> 24:33.440
How's the show going?

24:33.440 --> 24:34.400
Bum Bum died.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.800
You and your brother's telling fun jokes.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.560
You'll never see Bum Bum again.

24:40.560 --> 24:41.680
I miss Bum Bum already.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.800
Can you read the next question?

24:42.800 --> 24:43.680
It'll get the taste of Bum Bum.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.960
I love that, Griff.

24:44.960 --> 24:48.400
I work at Dunkin' Donuts.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.920
They put donuts in parentheses.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.000
Have the strength of your convictions.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.360
You're just called Dunkin' now.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.520
And I have many customers that I see every day.

24:57.520 --> 24:59.360
One of my regulars is a guy,

24:59.360 --> 25:02.080
maybe late twenties, that smells really fucking good.

25:02.640 --> 25:03.600
Every time he walks in,

25:03.600 --> 25:05.680
the whole store suddenly smells better.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.440
How do I compliment him on his good smell

25:07.440 --> 25:08.480
without it being weird?

25:09.040 --> 25:11.360
Could I at least ask him where slash how

25:11.360 --> 25:13.040
he got this good smell?

25:13.040 --> 25:15.280
That's from good smells in the Smoky Mountains.

25:16.880 --> 25:20.240
I recently got a new cologne

25:20.240 --> 25:23.440
from a service that kind of tells you

25:23.440 --> 25:25.040
what cologne would be good for you.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.880
And I'm not gonna fucking name them

25:26.880 --> 25:28.000
because they didn't pay,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.480
but like basically I did this.

25:30.480 --> 25:32.160
And the first day I put it on,

25:32.160 --> 25:34.320
I was signing my daughter in at school

25:34.320 --> 25:36.400
and there was several parents gathered around

25:36.960 --> 25:38.720
and one of the moms walked up

25:38.720 --> 25:41.040
and was like, hmm, somebody smells good.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.880
And this woman next to me has the fucking audacity.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.720
Has the sheer gall to announce

25:50.720 --> 25:53.440
that it's probably her body splash.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.720
Is it Trisha?

25:54.720 --> 25:56.800
Is it probably your body splash?

25:56.800 --> 25:58.720
It sniped your stink, bruh.

25:58.720 --> 25:59.200
Wow.

25:59.200 --> 26:02.400
Is this, or is it the fucking heat

26:02.400 --> 26:07.200
I am bringing today with my new perfect stink?

26:07.920 --> 26:09.440
No, it's not you.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.760
It's not your body splash.

26:11.760 --> 26:13.520
It's my amazing aroma.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.800
The point of this is I knew that compliment was for me

26:16.800 --> 26:20.160
and my ego dined off of it for the rest of the week,

26:20.160 --> 26:23.120
just feeling like a cool, good smelling person.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.880
I think, J-Man, I think that that was

26:24.880 --> 26:26.720
a win-win scenario for you

26:26.720 --> 26:29.360
because I think everyone knows it wasn't her

26:29.360 --> 26:31.120
and everyone knows it was you.

26:31.120 --> 26:35.200
So not only did you smell great, she sounded bad.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.720
Yeah, that's great.

26:36.720 --> 26:40.240
I would argue that if somebody walks into a room

26:41.280 --> 26:45.920
and changes the entire aroma dynamic of that chamber,

26:46.640 --> 26:48.960
it doesn't matter how good or bad that smell is.

26:48.960 --> 26:52.400
I think that smell is probably too assertive.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.080
Especially a bakery.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.560
A bakery has its own cologne.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.800
Well, are we calling Dunkin' a bakery?

26:58.800 --> 27:01.920
I mean, it is a lowercase b bakery.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.920
Very stuffed, baked there.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.440
Is that, do you know that to be true?

27:07.440 --> 27:08.160
I don't think you do.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.400
I don't, I don't.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.960
Now that you mention it, I assume so.

27:13.920 --> 27:14.960
Something's baked there.

27:14.960 --> 27:18.880
I'm sure I've seen an oven for my sandwiches.

27:18.880 --> 27:22.480
So let's just try a few things, okay?

27:22.480 --> 27:22.800
Okay.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.000
Okay.

27:24.000 --> 27:24.720
Hey, that smells good.

27:24.720 --> 27:25.120
Is that you?

27:25.920 --> 27:26.640
Nope, nope.

27:27.680 --> 27:27.920
Why not?

27:27.920 --> 27:29.920
I don't think you say that smells good.

27:30.720 --> 27:31.760
Hey, what's that good smell?

27:31.760 --> 27:32.240
Is that you?

27:34.080 --> 27:36.080
Hey, Choice Aroma.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.520
Ooh, that's getting closer.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.200
Why don't you just say that?

27:39.200 --> 27:40.560
Just say it, folks.

27:41.120 --> 27:41.680
YOLO.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.720
Just tell somebody they smell fucking good.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.720
Okay, let me try something.

27:46.720 --> 27:47.520
Let me try something.

27:48.240 --> 27:50.080
What cologne are you wearing?

27:50.080 --> 27:51.200
It smells great.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.120
Uh, presumptuous.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.520
What is your scent?

27:55.520 --> 27:56.240
That's bad.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.560
You obviously know that you've ramped into a bad sort of-

27:58.560 --> 28:00.080
Tell me about your musk.

28:00.080 --> 28:00.400
That's-

28:00.400 --> 28:01.600
Enumerate your musk.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.320
Let's play a fun game, and we'll-

28:04.320 --> 28:06.240
You've got a lot of great notes.

28:06.240 --> 28:10.880
Let's try and say an innocuous thing in a terrible way,

28:10.880 --> 28:13.440
or a terrible thing in an innocuous way.

28:14.240 --> 28:17.200
I don't think either one is gonna get you there.

28:18.160 --> 28:18.960
Okay, let me try.

28:18.960 --> 28:22.240
All right, this is gonna sound a little weird,

28:22.240 --> 28:23.840
but I would love to eat your smell.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.040
Now, which one was that, Justin?

28:28.080 --> 28:28.720
Yeah.

28:28.720 --> 28:28.960
Okay.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.200
So obviously, don't say that.

28:32.080 --> 28:32.880
Let me try this.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.160
Is someone wearing perfume?

28:35.600 --> 28:36.560
Yummy!

28:36.560 --> 28:38.480
Is not gonna get you there either.

28:38.480 --> 28:38.640
No.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.360
Hey, I was just huffing what you're bringing, and I love it.

28:44.480 --> 28:46.240
Hey, can you walk a little closer?

28:46.240 --> 28:47.600
I'd love to get another huff.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.040
Ooh, I like that.

28:49.040 --> 28:52.080
I think what we're hitting on is it is intensely personal

28:52.080 --> 28:54.640
to comment on another person's aroma, right?

28:54.640 --> 28:55.040
Yeah, but-

28:55.040 --> 28:56.320
It's intensely personal.

28:56.320 --> 28:56.800
Unless-

28:57.440 --> 28:58.400
Unless-

28:58.400 --> 28:58.880
Unless-

28:58.880 --> 29:02.480
They wouldn't put on an odor that waffable

29:03.600 --> 29:05.680
if they didn't want to get waffed.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.760
I don't know that that checks out.

29:09.760 --> 29:14.480
If you walk into a room and change the scent matrix of that room-

29:14.480 --> 29:16.160
Right, which you shouldn't be doing.

29:16.160 --> 29:20.080
You put on a scent hoping it will be detected by others.

29:20.080 --> 29:20.400
Yeah.

29:21.440 --> 29:25.520
I tell you this, sometimes I'll get ready in the morning, and I shower,

29:25.520 --> 29:29.920
and maybe I put on a little lotion afterwards, and I'm feeling very cute,

29:29.920 --> 29:33.280
and then I go to join my family, and my daughter says,

29:33.280 --> 29:36.240
you smell great, and that makes you feel nice.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.920
Yeah, she's a child though.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.280
But here's what I'm saying.

29:39.280 --> 29:44.320
Maybe the problem is you do not have a previous relationship with this customer.

29:44.320 --> 29:48.800
Maybe you smell great needs to not be the first thing you say to them.

29:48.800 --> 29:49.440
Yeah.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.760
So you're saying you develop a relationship

29:51.760 --> 29:53.920
so you have a pretext for complimenting their smell.

29:53.920 --> 29:54.480
Correct.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.760
That seems backwards to me.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.280
Wow, that's weird.

29:57.280 --> 30:01.120
I'm not saying you date for six months before you do it.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.600
I'm saying maybe it's not the first thing you say.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.160
Maybe it's like, hey, thanks for stopping by.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.320
It's good to see you again.

30:08.320 --> 30:12.320
If I could get some people to co-sign my legislation

30:12.320 --> 30:16.400
mandating that the only smell people are allowed to put on their body

30:16.400 --> 30:21.440
is Old Spice's Pure Sport, the default smell for human beings,

30:21.440 --> 30:23.360
we wouldn't be running into that situation.

30:23.360 --> 30:26.880
We would be working at Dunkin' and someone would come in and be like,

30:26.880 --> 30:28.880
who smells like Old Spice Pure Sport?

30:28.880 --> 30:30.800
And everybody will crane their necks.

30:30.800 --> 30:33.200
Why that's me, because legally,

30:33.200 --> 30:37.040
the only smell you're allowed to have is Old Spice Pure Sport.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.800
I have some challenging news here.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.520
Nobody wants to get behind this with me.

30:41.520 --> 30:45.600
I'm not giving fucking free plugs to anybody.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.200
It's 2020.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.040
I'm going to fill my life with Laughter and Love

30:49.040 --> 30:52.640
and fill my wallet with that fucking advertising dollar.

30:52.640 --> 30:53.840
And get down to business.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.240
And no, you can't.

30:56.240 --> 30:57.360
You shan't, you can't.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.320
I have a troubling alert.

31:01.280 --> 31:04.240
There's 13 minutes left in the race for Bum Bum

31:04.240 --> 31:05.840
as I've come to think of it.

31:05.840 --> 31:10.800
And now, Bum Bum, I've been watching the bidding price creep steadily up

31:10.800 --> 31:14.960
to just refreshing the page and it keeps jumping up by twos

31:14.960 --> 31:17.520
as someone tries to get to what my reserve is.

31:17.520 --> 31:22.560
And it's 66, 68, and now I've seen it go to 70.

31:22.560 --> 31:26.960
And now, now we're at 72 and they're just fucking chilling.

31:27.840 --> 31:31.120
And I'm so, somebody wants this fucking doll terribly.

31:31.120 --> 31:31.600
And Justin, what's your reserve?

31:31.600 --> 31:32.640
They want it terribly.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.360
What's the reserve?

31:34.080 --> 31:36.160
That's not the important thing.

31:36.160 --> 31:42.000
The important thing is that it's for the bid.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.040
That's huge.

31:43.040 --> 31:47.040
There's someone with a W at the beginning of their username.

31:47.040 --> 31:48.240
And they just bid.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.000
I'm looking at the history of this now.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.480
60, 62, 65, 67, 69, nice, 71.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.480
And I'm still sitting pretty.

31:56.480 --> 32:00.880
And apparently at 71, they're like, that's too much for this.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.160
Too rich for my blood.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.280
Here's the thing that is tripping me out about this.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.160
I want to talk about right now.

32:08.080 --> 32:16.240
If you're going to bid $71 for a very bad doll,

32:17.120 --> 32:20.720
you believe that it is haunted with a ghost, correct?

32:20.720 --> 32:21.200
Right.

32:21.200 --> 32:24.480
You must on some level, unless you're doing a competing podcast,

32:24.480 --> 32:25.440
let's rule that out.

32:26.160 --> 32:30.800
You must on some level believe this is a doll with a ghost inside it, right?

32:30.800 --> 32:31.040
Yeah.

32:31.040 --> 32:35.360
Yeah, so what is it in your psyche where you're like,

32:35.360 --> 32:41.760
I'll buy a ghost for $71, but I'm not going to buy a ghost for $73.

32:42.480 --> 32:43.360
That's too much.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.520
Well, Justin, I'll tell you, I've been doing a lot of budgeting.

32:46.480 --> 32:49.440
And I think the problem is we're only halfway through the month.

32:49.440 --> 32:52.400
And they're worried that they're going to use up all of their haunted

32:52.400 --> 32:54.960
toy budget early on in the month.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.800
And then at the end of the month, they're going to see something

32:56.800 --> 33:03.200
they really want for $73 and oh, no, they don't have it left in the budget.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.080
Relatable.

33:04.080 --> 33:06.720
Speaking of budgets, let's go to the money zone.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.240
Yeah, I'm going to need to go to the money zone

33:08.240 --> 33:10.160
after I just raise this fucking reserve again.

33:20.960 --> 33:21.920
I'm going to brush those teeth.

33:23.360 --> 33:26.000
Now let's talk because I was excited about mine.

33:26.000 --> 33:26.960
Okay, what was yours?

33:26.960 --> 33:28.480
Because it's probably better than mine.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.320
Going to brush those teeth with Quip.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.480
So that's like saying that's like me planting my flag in the ground.

33:34.480 --> 33:34.960
Like, hey, everybody.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.320
Oh, okay.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.200
Can I try mine?

33:37.200 --> 33:38.000
Yeah, sure.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.360
You got to Quip it.

33:39.360 --> 33:40.400
Quip it good.

33:40.400 --> 33:40.960
Ah, shit.

33:41.760 --> 33:42.960
That's pretty good.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.160
I feel like they were both good.

33:44.160 --> 33:45.280
You take this then.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.360
Since I just want to get a hand on the ball.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.240
Justin, you want to?

33:51.280 --> 33:53.120
I put my hand up on your hip.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.720
When I Quip, you Quip, we Quip.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.240
It's pretty good.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.480
Fuck, I think that's the end of the ad.

33:58.480 --> 33:59.040
Thanks Quip.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.120
Quip, it's tooth.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.600
Quip, it's tooth is pretty fucking good, man.

34:05.600 --> 34:07.440
I Quip my hair back and forth.

34:07.440 --> 34:10.000
I Quip my hair back and forth.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.360
These people make toothbrushes.

34:11.360 --> 34:12.720
Yeah, can you believe it?

34:12.720 --> 34:12.960
What?

34:14.880 --> 34:18.080
In this day and age, the audacity.

34:18.080 --> 34:20.320
These are toothbrushes with electricity in it.

34:20.320 --> 34:27.520
That's right, the stuff from Lightning and they do it for two minutes.

34:27.520 --> 34:31.200
It's got sensitive sonic vibrations with a built-in timer and 30 second pulses.

34:31.920 --> 34:35.120
Are there tiny people in there who are shaking the toothbrush?

34:35.120 --> 34:35.920
We don't know.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.520
The science isn't back yet.

34:37.520 --> 34:40.320
Is the electricity hurting the little toothbrush people?

34:40.320 --> 34:42.400
Probably, but your teeth are going to be so clean.

34:42.400 --> 34:43.200
Your mouth so fresh.

34:43.200 --> 34:45.120
Go to getquip.com slash my brother right now.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.120
Get your first refill for free.

34:47.120 --> 34:51.280
That's a new stand in defiance of God and hold electricity in your hand

34:51.280 --> 34:52.400
and let it touch your teeth.

34:52.400 --> 34:55.280
Quip is the Prometheus of tooth brushing.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.920
You will harness the power of the cosmos.

34:57.920 --> 35:02.480
Go to getquip.com slash my brother and that's Quip.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.320
That is the Good Habits Company.

35:04.320 --> 35:05.200
Hold on just one second.

35:05.200 --> 35:08.160
I need to email Max Fun and just figure out when we're going to reschedule

35:08.160 --> 35:11.200
this ad that we're going to have to make up for Quip.

35:11.200 --> 35:12.480
If you just give me a second.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.280
Oh, you know what?

35:13.280 --> 35:14.880
I don't have to email him.

35:14.880 --> 35:20.880
I can send a letter because sending a letter can be as easy as sending an email

35:20.880 --> 35:22.560
when you can do it at home.

35:22.560 --> 35:23.280
Fuck off.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.680
With stamps.com.

35:26.240 --> 35:26.720
What?

35:26.720 --> 35:29.360
You know, it could be if you got a busy day ahead of you

35:29.360 --> 35:31.680
and maybe you don't have time to get to the post office.

35:31.680 --> 35:32.800
Well, good news.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.280
You can do the stamps for yourself.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.720
Everybody do the stamps.

35:39.440 --> 35:44.080
With stamps.com, you can save five cents off every first class stamp

35:44.080 --> 35:46.400
and up to 40% off shipping rates.

35:46.400 --> 35:49.680
That kind of savings really adds up, especially for small businesses.

35:50.480 --> 35:53.840
If there's a business listening to this, hello.

35:55.040 --> 35:55.840
Hi, business.

35:56.560 --> 35:57.280
Hi, business.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.920
You sentient weirdo.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.280
Why are you listening to podcasts?

36:01.280 --> 36:02.560
Get back to earning capital.

36:03.440 --> 36:07.760
Stamps.com brings all the services of the US Postal Service right to your computer.

36:07.760 --> 36:11.680
Whether you're a small office sending invoices, that's impossible.

36:11.680 --> 36:14.960
You can't be a small office and a person listening to a podcast.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.240
It just doesn't make sense.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.840
It's that small an office, Justin.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.960
The office is inside one person.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.720
You don't need me for this.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.840
It's a computer that lets you print stamps, okay?

36:25.840 --> 36:28.240
Oh no, don't give it away.

36:28.240 --> 36:31.520
Stamps.com, it's a website that does stamp.

36:31.520 --> 36:35.360
Right now, our listeners can get a special offer that includes a four-week trial

36:35.360 --> 36:40.880
plus free postage and a digital scale without any long-term commitment.

36:40.880 --> 36:43.760
Except the commitment of telling people it's not for drugs

36:43.760 --> 36:45.440
every time they see it at your house.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.360
That is a commitment you are making.

36:47.360 --> 36:51.200
Just go to stamps.com, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage,

36:51.200 --> 36:53.120
and type in my brother.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.400
That's stamps.com.

36:55.680 --> 36:56.560
Enter my brother.

36:57.920 --> 36:58.480
Hey, everyone.

36:58.480 --> 37:02.080
It's I, John Hodgman of the Judge John Hodgman podcast.

37:02.080 --> 37:04.800
And I, Elliott Kalin of the Flophouse podcast.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.040
And we've made a whole new podcast.

37:07.040 --> 37:12.400
A 12-episode special miniseries called iPodius,

37:12.400 --> 37:15.200
in which we recap, discuss, and explore

37:15.200 --> 37:20.800
the very famous 1976 BBC miniseries about ancient Rome called I, Claudius.

37:20.800 --> 37:24.400
We've got incredible guests such as Gillian Jacobs, Paul F. Tompkins,

37:24.400 --> 37:27.920
as well as star of I, Claudius, Sir Patrick Stewart,

37:27.920 --> 37:30.720
and his son, non-sir Daniel Stewart.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.320
Don't worry, Dan, you'll get there someday.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.320
iPodius is the name of the show.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.360
Every week from Maximumfun.org for only 12 weeks.

37:37.360 --> 37:40.480
Get them at Maximumfun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

37:45.040 --> 37:47.840
Reach for the stars.

37:47.840 --> 37:48.720
Oh, okay.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.160
I got scared there for a minute.

37:50.800 --> 37:53.440
No, it's the only one of my bits that's any fun.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.400
Reach for the stars.

37:54.400 --> 37:58.640
I'm going to give you reviews from the service Amazon.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.640
I'm going to tell you the number of stars in the review,

38:00.640 --> 38:03.120
and you're going to try to guess the product.

38:03.120 --> 38:03.620
Okay.

38:03.620 --> 38:06.980
Now, this is one out of five stars.

38:07.700 --> 38:10.820
The subject line is dirty and looked used.

38:11.860 --> 38:14.100
I bought this as a gift for a friend.

38:14.100 --> 38:15.620
She liked the thought,

38:15.620 --> 38:18.260
but when she opened it from the shipping package,

38:18.260 --> 38:21.540
it was dirty, sticky, and looked gross.

38:21.540 --> 38:23.380
I wish I had opened it first

38:23.380 --> 38:25.780
because I would maybe have been able to clean it up

38:25.780 --> 38:27.300
and make it look new.

38:27.300 --> 38:27.800
Hmm.

38:28.740 --> 38:32.180
See, I was going to say some sort of funny prop, like a fake.

38:32.180 --> 38:35.780
Well, hold on, I feel like my best bet here

38:35.780 --> 38:39.060
is to always lead with fake poopy of some kind.

38:39.940 --> 38:41.140
So I'll start with that.

38:41.140 --> 38:42.580
I will say along that vein,

38:43.700 --> 38:45.620
you are in the right ballpark.

38:45.620 --> 38:48.020
These are all gag gifts.

38:48.020 --> 38:48.520
Okay.

38:48.900 --> 38:51.300
I'm just saying this bit's going to get awfully easy

38:51.300 --> 38:53.780
if it's always fake poopy or throw up or pee pee.

38:53.780 --> 38:56.180
It's not always going to be fake poopy or throw up.

38:56.180 --> 38:58.420
They're just, the reviews for them are so good.

38:59.060 --> 38:59.940
X-ray specs?

38:59.940 --> 39:01.380
Oh, good guess, good guess.

39:01.380 --> 39:04.180
Okay, this next one, there's another one out of five stars.

39:04.180 --> 39:05.700
Subject line, not cute.

39:06.260 --> 39:09.860
I bought this for a gag gift, but it wasn't funny.

39:09.860 --> 39:11.780
It was just ugly.

39:11.780 --> 39:12.280
Hmm.

39:12.980 --> 39:13.620
Hmm.

39:13.620 --> 39:15.220
Maybe like a nasty face?

39:16.180 --> 39:18.740
Like a mask that makes your face look like a nasty face.

39:21.300 --> 39:22.500
Faked teeth?

39:22.500 --> 39:23.860
Like funny fake teeth?

39:23.860 --> 39:24.900
Ooh, that's a good guess.

39:24.900 --> 39:25.700
Okay, one more.

39:26.500 --> 39:27.700
One out of five stars.

39:27.700 --> 39:30.100
Hollow plastic, not durable.

39:30.100 --> 39:31.940
Got it for a gag gift for the wife.

39:32.500 --> 39:35.860
Knocked it off the counter before ever using it and it broke.

39:35.860 --> 39:40.100
The plastic is hollow and is not durable for drops and use.

39:40.100 --> 39:45.620
With wine, dot dot dot, things will be dropped, dot dot dot, eventually.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.260
Okay, wait, okay.

39:48.260 --> 39:51.060
Is it a giant novelty wine glass?

39:51.060 --> 39:51.560
No.

39:52.660 --> 39:52.900
Damn.

39:52.900 --> 39:56.100
Is a wine glass by the slope kind of supposed to be a wiener?

39:56.980 --> 39:58.820
Oh, so close, Griffin.

39:58.820 --> 40:05.060
It is the Sir Perky novelty bottle stopper, where the stopper is his penis.

40:05.060 --> 40:05.700
Shit.

40:05.700 --> 40:10.500
So it's like a guy, but his dick's out and he fucks your wine to keep it fresh?

40:11.060 --> 40:11.620
Correct.

40:13.060 --> 40:15.620
So someone got that and they're like, this isn't cute.

40:16.180 --> 40:17.860
I don't know what I was doing.

40:17.860 --> 40:19.220
Now, this isn't cute.

40:19.220 --> 40:24.660
This next product, I normally tend to stick to the one star reviews or the five star reviews,

40:24.660 --> 40:30.580
but I found a new plethora of fun in the three out of five star reviews.

40:30.580 --> 40:32.340
The nice middle of the road.

40:32.340 --> 40:33.860
This is three out of five stars.

40:34.980 --> 40:36.980
Not sure how good it is going to be.

40:38.420 --> 40:38.660
What?

40:41.220 --> 40:42.180
Is that it?

40:42.180 --> 40:42.420
Yep.

40:43.060 --> 40:45.780
Three stars, not sure how good it is going to be.

40:45.780 --> 40:46.420
Uh huh.

40:46.420 --> 40:46.660
Okay.

40:46.660 --> 40:49.060
This is a kind of preemptive review.

40:49.060 --> 40:49.700
Right.

40:49.700 --> 40:51.140
There's literally nothing I could use.

40:51.140 --> 40:52.500
A preview, if you will.

40:52.500 --> 40:55.380
Uh, this one's another three out of five stars.

40:55.380 --> 40:56.740
Subject line, nah.

40:57.780 --> 41:00.100
And the text is, nah.

41:02.820 --> 41:04.820
You know we can't guess it from these clues.

41:04.820 --> 41:05.300
Oh, I know.

41:05.300 --> 41:05.780
Don't worry.

41:05.780 --> 41:07.780
I've got one at the end here, but here's another one.

41:07.780 --> 41:09.380
This is another three out of five.

41:09.380 --> 41:11.140
Subject line, fair.

41:11.140 --> 41:13.620
The text, not a bad product.

41:13.620 --> 41:16.740
So kind of the perfect three out of five star review.

41:17.620 --> 41:18.180
It's not bad.

41:18.180 --> 41:21.300
That's like life minutes you don't get back.

41:21.300 --> 41:21.780
You know what I mean?

41:21.780 --> 41:23.140
I'll be like, I sort of like this.

41:23.140 --> 41:24.740
Okay, I'm going to go let everyone know.

41:24.740 --> 41:26.180
I'm going to go spread the word.

41:26.180 --> 41:28.180
Now, this one I think is going to give it away.

41:28.180 --> 41:29.780
This is a four out of five star.

41:30.420 --> 41:34.980
Uh, bought this and it's going to give it away because it says what it is in the review.

41:34.980 --> 41:37.860
But I like the direction the end of the review takes.

41:38.660 --> 41:41.300
Bought this for a random gift exchange with friends.

41:41.300 --> 41:46.900
Cute, easy to use, held up well over multiple uses in the microwave, and enjoyable for most

41:46.900 --> 41:50.900
people who love s'mores, even when not camping or near a fire.

41:50.900 --> 41:52.580
Otherwise unnecessary.

41:52.580 --> 41:57.300
Just use a plate on top of the s'more on top of another plate.

41:57.300 --> 42:01.700
So prevent the marshmallow from pumping up too much rather than melting properly.

42:04.500 --> 42:07.220
Is this a microwavable s'more maker?

42:07.220 --> 42:08.180
That is Craig's.

42:08.180 --> 42:13.300
But this person just chose to just undermine the whole industry by giving away the secret of

42:13.300 --> 42:15.620
just use another plate on top of it.

42:15.620 --> 42:16.340
Yeah, wait a minute.

42:16.340 --> 42:17.780
You don't need this.

42:17.780 --> 42:18.900
No one needs this.

42:18.900 --> 42:21.060
Wait a minute, what am I doing?

42:23.220 --> 42:24.660
What are any of us doing?

42:25.460 --> 42:27.780
Oh, how about another question?

42:27.780 --> 42:29.460
Yeah, how about a yahoo actually?

42:29.460 --> 42:29.940
Whoa.

42:29.940 --> 42:31.300
Oh, sure.

42:31.300 --> 42:34.340
I have a hole in the armpit of my sweater that I've just found.

42:34.340 --> 42:36.740
Oh, is this the yahoo?

42:36.740 --> 42:38.180
No, this is just like my day.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.300
I got it, by the way.

42:39.300 --> 42:41.860
I didn't want anybody to know, but I got it.

42:41.860 --> 42:44.020
Cincinnati, Bum Bum is coming for you.

42:44.020 --> 42:45.140
Oh, Jesus Christ.

42:45.140 --> 42:46.340
This is my home where I live.

42:46.340 --> 42:50.020
Yeah, well, now Bum Bum moves there too, because I'm going to hide him somewhere.

42:50.020 --> 42:52.420
The rafters of the city.

42:59.460 --> 43:02.260
Are you ripping your shirt open like the Hulk?

43:12.020 --> 43:12.660
What did you do?

43:12.660 --> 43:19.380
Did you just live on camera destroy your shirt?

43:19.380 --> 43:25.860
Griffin has now, boy, I'm glad I'm recording this call.

43:26.660 --> 43:29.860
Griffin has now ripped his shirt sleeve off.

43:31.380 --> 43:37.940
He's ripped his shirt sleeve off and is flexing for us.

43:37.940 --> 43:39.380
Which one do you guys want?

43:39.380 --> 43:41.380
The bear barracuda here?

43:41.380 --> 43:44.660
Or this guy that's still in a big, long sweater sleeve.

43:44.660 --> 43:45.700
What are my options again?

43:45.700 --> 43:48.100
Griffin, why did you ruin your sweater just now?

43:48.100 --> 43:50.500
What are my options again?

43:50.500 --> 43:51.780
Do you want this guy?

43:53.060 --> 43:55.940
You know what you're going to get when you go through this door.

43:55.940 --> 43:57.220
This door, you don't know.

43:57.220 --> 43:58.180
Maybe it's weaker.

43:58.180 --> 44:03.060
It has to be weaker than this one, because this one's fucking huge, but maybe it's not, right?

44:04.260 --> 44:05.460
Right, yeah, that's true.

44:07.460 --> 44:09.300
I'm half intimidated right now.

44:09.300 --> 44:10.100
Good, you should be.

44:10.100 --> 44:11.220
The sweater was already ruined.

44:11.220 --> 44:13.860
It had a huge hole in the armpit, and that's no good for me.

44:13.860 --> 44:18.820
Here's a, I got to get this big, intimidating picture of Buzz Aldrin off my fucking screen.

44:22.340 --> 44:23.540
Okay, here's a Yahoo.

44:23.540 --> 44:25.860
This one was sent in by Michelle.

44:25.860 --> 44:26.900
Thank you, Michelle.

44:26.900 --> 44:31.140
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Carol, who asks, as I turn my video off,

44:31.140 --> 44:40.180
Willard, you like pine cones more if they were alive and could crawl around.

44:40.900 --> 44:42.980
Huh, huh.

44:42.980 --> 44:47.380
You know, okay, I have been looking for a way to like pine cones more.

44:48.100 --> 44:50.980
Yeah, I don't, I don't dislike pine cones.

44:52.100 --> 44:55.780
I certainly wouldn't say, like, if we were walking through a pine forest,

44:55.780 --> 44:58.580
somebody pointed at one of these little spiky bastards on the ground and said,

44:58.580 --> 45:02.900
do you like that, I think I would probably say, like, yeah, it's fine.

45:02.900 --> 45:04.660
I'm pretty, I'm pretty, like.

45:05.780 --> 45:06.740
It's okay.

45:06.740 --> 45:11.700
Yeah, now, smear one in peanut butter, roll it in bird seed, hang it up on my porch.

45:11.700 --> 45:12.820
I love the thing.

45:12.820 --> 45:14.340
Who's that ever, who's that been for?

45:14.340 --> 45:16.420
I've seen, I've done that before, I think.

45:16.420 --> 45:19.540
I did that at like a church camp almost certainly at some point,

45:19.540 --> 45:22.980
but like, even when I was doing it, I was like, who's this for?

45:22.980 --> 45:24.820
Like, is a deer going to come eat this?

45:24.820 --> 45:27.460
It's for birdies, for birds.

45:27.460 --> 45:28.820
Do birds like peanut butter?

45:28.820 --> 45:29.620
That's wild.

45:30.180 --> 45:33.220
I think the, I think the peanut butter is just a means of conveyance

45:33.220 --> 45:34.980
for the bird seed treat.

45:34.980 --> 45:35.480
Right.

45:36.180 --> 45:39.060
I, I, we had a bird feeder out back of the house

45:39.060 --> 45:42.500
and we had to get a little ladder and we filled it up, right?

45:42.500 --> 45:44.180
Was the little ladder for the birds, Justin?

45:44.180 --> 45:44.980
Cause they have wings.

45:45.620 --> 45:48.420
These fucking birds ate it in 24 hours.

45:49.060 --> 45:52.500
So then it was just like, I had this moment where I was like, I'm not going to fill,

45:52.500 --> 45:54.740
these, these guys are obviously starving.

45:54.740 --> 46:00.820
And also I'm not going to get into this fucking codependent relationship

46:00.820 --> 46:06.260
where I am like every 24 hours getting out the ladder to go feed these birds.

46:06.260 --> 46:10.500
And before you tweeted me, yeah, it might've been squirrels.

46:10.500 --> 46:11.780
I don't monitor it.

46:11.780 --> 46:12.260
Okay.

46:12.260 --> 46:14.340
They're the same to Justin.

46:14.340 --> 46:18.100
It's the same outdoors animal to Justin essentially.

46:19.060 --> 46:19.780
Here's the problem.

46:19.780 --> 46:21.860
This is the problem with bird feeders in general.

46:21.860 --> 46:24.900
And I'm sorry to get up on my soapbox again about this,

46:24.900 --> 46:29.780
but I am providing food for one of like the top three

46:30.820 --> 46:32.500
most important things for living beings.

46:33.300 --> 46:35.460
And I guess maybe they're helping with, I don't know,

46:35.460 --> 46:38.340
pollination or bugs or whatever, but I don't notice that.

46:38.340 --> 46:39.540
They don't bring your newspaper.

46:39.540 --> 46:41.540
They don't pick up your newspaper and fly it in.

46:41.540 --> 46:43.860
They certainly aren't making you fucking dresses

46:43.860 --> 46:45.300
so that you can go to the ball.

46:45.300 --> 46:45.700
That's some bullshit.

46:45.700 --> 46:46.820
And I fast them.

46:46.820 --> 46:47.620
Yeah, that's some bullshit.

46:47.620 --> 46:49.620
Holly was trying to shove down our throats.

46:49.620 --> 46:50.740
And here's the thing.

46:50.740 --> 46:52.580
I feed my kids.

46:52.580 --> 46:54.020
They do cool stuff.

46:54.020 --> 46:55.380
I feed my dogs.

46:55.380 --> 46:56.820
They do cool stuff.

46:56.820 --> 46:57.780
Feed my cat.

46:57.780 --> 46:59.620
She sometimes lets me pet her.

46:59.620 --> 47:01.300
What's this bird bringing to the table?

47:02.340 --> 47:03.700
Then I'm going out there.

47:03.700 --> 47:05.380
I'm getting it seed.

47:05.380 --> 47:05.620
Yeah.

47:06.660 --> 47:09.700
What do you want a bird to bring to a table, Travis?

47:09.700 --> 47:12.500
Like a scrap of hair?

47:12.500 --> 47:13.540
A small twig?

47:13.540 --> 47:16.660
I read about these birds who are bringing shiny rings

47:16.660 --> 47:20.420
and lost camera lenses and stuff back to people.

47:20.420 --> 47:22.340
Where's my army of birds?

47:22.340 --> 47:25.060
So let's, I mean, I've had some time to think about it

47:25.060 --> 47:27.140
while you two have been talking a bunch of bullshit

47:27.140 --> 47:28.340
that doesn't mean anything.

47:28.340 --> 47:30.260
I think it'd be pretty bad-ass if pine cones

47:30.260 --> 47:31.700
were just scuttling around.

47:31.700 --> 47:33.460
What if they did it whenever you weren't looking?

47:34.420 --> 47:36.500
That's a fun little Toy Story thing.

47:36.500 --> 47:38.020
But I think you know what would be better

47:38.020 --> 47:39.540
if they did it while I was looking.

47:39.540 --> 47:42.420
So I could see it and be delighted by it.

47:42.420 --> 47:44.660
I do think, though, if you go to a Michaels

47:45.460 --> 47:47.780
and they have craft pine cones,

47:47.780 --> 47:49.540
those shouldn't move around.

47:49.540 --> 47:51.380
Because Michaels is a place of business.

47:51.380 --> 47:52.500
It's not the forest.

47:53.220 --> 47:55.620
That is true.

47:55.620 --> 47:59.620
In 99.9% of cases, that is absolutely true.

47:59.620 --> 48:01.540
But you know what would be fucking funny, guys?

48:02.180 --> 48:02.660
What?

48:02.660 --> 48:03.220
What, dude?

48:04.020 --> 48:05.780
When like kids make little turkey,

48:05.780 --> 48:08.020
like craft turkeys out of pine cones.

48:08.020 --> 48:09.220
Would those move around too?

48:09.780 --> 48:10.500
You would never seen it?

48:10.500 --> 48:11.220
Oh, that would be cool.

48:11.220 --> 48:12.660
They use it like the body of the turkey

48:12.660 --> 48:14.740
because it looks like a turkey's body.

48:14.740 --> 48:16.100
Oh, okay.

48:16.100 --> 48:17.700
So it would be like crawling around

48:17.700 --> 48:19.700
and it would have sort of turkey paper stuff on it.

48:21.060 --> 48:21.460
I like that.

48:21.460 --> 48:22.260
That would be great.

48:22.260 --> 48:24.020
But then why not just look at turkeys?

48:24.020 --> 48:26.100
What if the pine cones were turkey sized?

48:26.660 --> 48:27.460
What if, okay.

48:27.460 --> 48:29.300
Here's a fun thing that Travis just said

48:29.300 --> 48:30.660
and he didn't even know it

48:30.660 --> 48:32.340
because that's not how his brain works.

48:33.380 --> 48:35.140
If pine cones could move around

48:35.140 --> 48:38.020
and put turkeys now could not.

48:39.060 --> 48:41.380
So he just shifted it all one to the left.

48:41.380 --> 48:44.020
I think that, and just to keep things fresh,

48:44.020 --> 48:46.260
I think we should probably do that every once in a while.

48:46.260 --> 48:47.780
Now, does that mean that eventually

48:48.740 --> 48:51.780
human beings won't be able to move around anymore?

48:51.780 --> 48:52.900
Yeah, like in Wally.

48:52.900 --> 48:54.100
Wally's sitting on scooters.

48:54.740 --> 48:58.340
Well, no, it'll be more sort of just like

48:58.340 --> 49:00.180
we can't move around anymore.

49:00.740 --> 49:01.540
Tulips can.

49:02.100 --> 49:04.820
And it's like, well, it's our turn to cycle out.

49:04.820 --> 49:06.580
I just installed Pluto TV.

49:06.580 --> 49:08.020
I'm basically there right now.

49:08.660 --> 49:09.700
How am I supposed to get up?

49:09.700 --> 49:10.820
They're showing guts.

49:10.820 --> 49:11.460
Oh, really?

49:12.500 --> 49:13.220
Yeah, dude.

49:13.220 --> 49:17.540
Do you think if pine cones started to move around,

49:17.540 --> 49:19.380
then we would start eating more of them?

49:20.900 --> 49:21.460
Huh.

49:21.460 --> 49:22.100
Ha.

49:22.100 --> 49:22.900
Like if you're-

49:22.900 --> 49:24.580
Well, would they develop-

49:24.580 --> 49:25.300
A meat-

49:25.300 --> 49:27.140
Sort of sinew and a meat?

49:27.140 --> 49:27.380
Yeah.

49:28.340 --> 49:31.540
And an attitude that would make you feel kind of superior

49:31.540 --> 49:32.580
when eating them.

49:32.580 --> 49:34.500
I mean, what we're saying is basically

49:34.500 --> 49:36.260
how Hedgehog did happen.

49:36.260 --> 49:36.900
That is true.

49:36.900 --> 49:40.580
I would-

49:40.580 --> 49:43.460
Have you guys been imagining pineapples this whole time

49:43.460 --> 49:44.980
and you just not realize?

49:44.980 --> 49:46.340
What's a pineapple?

49:46.340 --> 49:47.540
No, that's different.

49:47.540 --> 49:48.180
No, no.

49:48.180 --> 49:48.980
You mean the fruit?

49:48.980 --> 49:49.540
Pineapple?

49:50.660 --> 49:52.660
Travis, did you just forget the word pineapple?

49:54.660 --> 49:55.940
Okay, but to be fair,

49:55.940 --> 49:57.620
you said it like it was two separate words.

49:57.620 --> 50:00.020
A pine apple as opposed to pineapple.

50:00.980 --> 50:01.780
Hey guys, lean in.

50:01.780 --> 50:05.700
What I've been picturing is like hermit crabs of the forest.

50:05.700 --> 50:08.660
Just carrying them pine cones on their backs.

50:08.660 --> 50:11.700
It's funnier to me though if it's just the pine cones.

50:11.700 --> 50:13.380
Yeah, what you're describing, Travis,

50:13.380 --> 50:15.540
is sort of a natural phenomenon that could-

50:15.540 --> 50:17.300
Griffin, the video's back on accidentally.

50:18.180 --> 50:20.820
Accidentally, your video's back on and I see you again.

50:20.820 --> 50:21.940
And I can see a nipple.

50:21.940 --> 50:23.060
I can't see a nipple.

50:23.060 --> 50:23.940
I could just see anyone if you could just-

50:23.940 --> 50:27.940
It feels like maybe you've got some sugar all the way down the side.

50:27.940 --> 50:31.940
Griffin, somebody got a light dusting of cinnamon on your armpit, Griffin.

50:31.940 --> 50:34.100
You should try to get that scene too.

50:34.100 --> 50:36.100
I got it. I got it out.

50:36.100 --> 50:37.460
I don't want to do this show anymore.

50:40.340 --> 50:43.380
See, the problem is we did one Monday and this is Wednesday.

50:43.380 --> 50:45.380
We did one two days later and here's the problem.

50:45.380 --> 50:47.540
That's the fucking grand reveal, okay?

50:47.540 --> 50:51.220
Just we didn't have a lot of good jokes saved up and I'm sorry, okay?

50:51.220 --> 50:54.020
I'm sorry, but it had some good jokes.

50:54.820 --> 50:57.860
Just go tweet about other episodes.

50:57.860 --> 51:00.180
If you didn't like this one, we'll do another one in a week

51:00.180 --> 51:01.620
and you'll like it more, okay?

51:01.620 --> 51:04.260
The next one's gonna, guys, the next one's gonna kick ass.

51:04.260 --> 51:04.740
Yeah.

51:04.740 --> 51:07.540
That's what we have to tell ourselves after every recording.

51:07.540 --> 51:08.820
The next one is gonna kick ass.

51:08.820 --> 51:09.620
Not this one though.

51:10.260 --> 51:12.820
Hey, can I give everyone a little reward for sticking around?

51:13.540 --> 51:13.940
Yeah.

51:13.940 --> 51:17.460
We're gonna announce our new tour dates.

51:17.460 --> 51:19.700
Oh, well, shouldn't we have done that after a good one?

51:19.700 --> 51:20.820
I think we may be.

51:20.820 --> 51:22.100
Yeah, let's not announce that.

51:22.900 --> 51:27.060
We're going to be at the Orpheum Theater in Boston, Massachusetts,

51:27.060 --> 51:30.660
April 1st with my brother, my brother and me and Sawbones.

51:30.660 --> 51:33.300
And then April 2nd with the Adventure Zone.

51:33.300 --> 51:34.740
And then on April 3rd,

51:34.740 --> 51:37.140
we're going to be at the Grand Theater at Foxwoods

51:37.140 --> 51:38.900
in Manshantucket, Connecticut

51:38.900 --> 51:41.140
with my brother, my brother and me and Sawbones.

51:41.780 --> 51:45.380
Then, believe it or not, three weeks later,

51:45.380 --> 51:49.300
we're going to be in Baltimore on April 22nd at the Hippodrome

51:49.300 --> 51:51.540
with my brother, my brother and me and Sawbones.

51:51.540 --> 51:54.820
And the 23rd with the Adventure Zone.

51:54.820 --> 51:57.940
And then on April 24th in Norfolk, Virginia

51:57.940 --> 52:00.500
at the Chrysler Theater with my brother, my brother and me

52:00.500 --> 52:01.220
and Sawbones.

52:01.220 --> 52:03.380
So that's a lot of April shows.

52:04.100 --> 52:06.980
And they bring May flows.

52:06.980 --> 52:08.660
May shows, yes, May shows.

52:08.660 --> 52:10.420
May will probably have some shows as well.

52:11.140 --> 52:11.640
Yes.

52:13.460 --> 52:14.820
And also, just so I know,

52:14.820 --> 52:17.140
we're really excited to see everybody on the JoCo Cruise.

52:17.140 --> 52:19.380
That's not a thing you need to buy tickets for or whatever.

52:19.380 --> 52:20.580
I'm just excited about it.

52:20.580 --> 52:22.420
That's a thing you can't buy tickets for,

52:22.420 --> 52:23.300
one might even say.

52:23.300 --> 52:25.060
I don't even know why we're talking about it right now.

52:25.060 --> 52:26.020
I'm just so excited.

52:26.580 --> 52:29.140
We are going to need questions for that, by the way.

52:29.140 --> 52:31.700
If you're going to be on the JoCo Cruise

52:31.700 --> 52:33.620
and you would like us to do questions,

52:33.620 --> 52:36.340
we're doing two of these bad boys on there.

52:36.340 --> 52:38.500
So you can go ahead and start emailing those in.

52:40.100 --> 52:42.100
JoCo Cruise questions.

52:43.460 --> 52:45.140
Is that the email address?

52:45.140 --> 52:46.820
No, just in the subject line.

52:46.820 --> 52:48.420
And if you know, like if you're in the red group

52:48.420 --> 52:49.940
or the gold group, let us know.

52:50.580 --> 52:53.300
So thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

52:53.300 --> 52:54.500
Max Fun Drive's coming up soon.

52:54.500 --> 52:57.060
We got a fun bonus episode ready for everybody

52:57.060 --> 53:01.860
that we all had just a squealing good time on, I would say.

53:01.860 --> 53:04.740
And thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

53:04.740 --> 53:06.260
for the use of our theme song,

53:06.260 --> 53:09.300
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

53:09.300 --> 53:12.420
You can find a link to that online.

53:14.420 --> 53:16.180
You can find a link to that in your pocket.

53:16.900 --> 53:19.140
You can find that song for sale.

53:20.100 --> 53:21.460
You can find that song for sale.

53:23.300 --> 53:24.900
This is the end of the episode.

53:24.900 --> 53:25.380
Yes.

53:25.380 --> 53:27.220
I do have a final yahoo, this one.

53:27.220 --> 53:28.180
Oh, wait, hold on.

53:28.740 --> 53:29.700
Sorry, there's one more thing.

53:30.500 --> 53:34.180
If you're listening to this on Monday the 17th,

53:34.180 --> 53:36.740
we still have a couple days before the Cincinnati shows.

53:37.460 --> 53:40.660
Go to mcroy.family, click on tours.

53:40.660 --> 53:41.780
We're gonna be at the Taft Theater

53:41.780 --> 53:44.420
with my brother, my brother and me on February 19th.

53:44.420 --> 53:47.460
And on February 20th, we're doing the Adventure Zone.

53:47.460 --> 53:49.860
I assume Sawbones is performing on Monday,

53:49.860 --> 53:51.940
or on the 19th as well.

53:51.940 --> 53:54.500
So go get those tickets and check out all the merch,

53:54.500 --> 53:57.220
mcroy.family, hugs and kisses, Travis.

53:57.780 --> 54:00.980
All right, here comes the final yahoo.

54:01.620 --> 54:02.260
Yeah.

54:02.260 --> 54:04.020
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

54:04.020 --> 54:05.700
Thank you, Adrian.

54:05.700 --> 54:08.900
It's yahoo answers user Disco Stew asks,

54:11.140 --> 54:16.580
is it me or is the purge totally implausible?

54:18.980 --> 54:20.260
My name is Justin McElroy.

54:20.260 --> 54:21.300
I'm Travis McElroy.

54:21.300 --> 54:22.660
I'm Griffin McElroy.

54:22.660 --> 54:24.580
It's been my brother, my brother, me, kiss your dad,

54:24.580 --> 54:26.740
square on the lips.

54:43.300 --> 54:45.140
Maximumfun.org.

54:45.140 --> 54:46.500

54:46.500 --> 54:47.700
Artist owned.

54:47.700 --> 54:48.740
Audience supported.

54:49.540 --> 54:52.340
Hey, you've reached Dr. Game Show.

54:52.340 --> 54:54.340
Leave your message after the beep.

54:55.620 --> 54:57.940
Dr. Game Show is my favorite podcast.

54:57.940 --> 55:00.660
And the only podcast my parents want me to listen to

55:00.660 --> 55:04.100
because I'm 12, but even old people love this show.

55:04.100 --> 55:07.540
Basically you call in, play games and have fun.

55:07.540 --> 55:10.500
If you win a game, a baby will send you a magnet in the mail.

55:10.500 --> 55:13.940
I have so many magnets and put them all over my locker.

55:13.940 --> 55:16.100
And pretty much everyone at school is jealous

55:16.100 --> 55:18.260
because they are very cool custom magnets.

55:18.260 --> 55:20.980
And it also means that I'm really good at winning games.

55:20.980 --> 55:23.540
And they even let me practice my record live on the air.

55:26.660 --> 55:29.460
Listening to this show is like going to a real doctor,

55:29.460 --> 55:31.860
but pretty much kind of better.

55:31.860 --> 55:32.980
Dr. Game Show rocks.

55:36.980 --> 55:39.300
Listen to Dr. Game Show on Maximum Fun.

55:39.300 --> 55:51.460
New episodes every other Wednesday.
