00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.080
Hello and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.080 --> 00:52.320
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Let me check my notes real quick. Oh,

00:52.320 --> 00:56.560
yep. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. You say that, you do that a lot these days.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.480
Well, I have to write a lot of stuff down.

00:58.480 --> 01:03.840
I'm just curious why you keep forgetting your name or even why you have-

01:03.840 --> 01:06.160
I've got a lot going on, Griffin.

01:07.120 --> 01:11.200
So much that you forget your own name and you need to refer to notes to look at it?

01:11.200 --> 01:14.080
I don't have to explain myself to you. You're not my boss.

01:14.080 --> 01:16.480
Check this out. I'm sure I'm Griffin. Positive.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.600
I wanted to do one of our great watch segments, you know, where we talk about

01:21.600 --> 01:25.280
the latest and greatest in cinema entertainment. So I just loaded up

01:25.280 --> 01:29.360
Marquee Cinemas over in Huntington over at the Pullman Square Plaza.

01:29.360 --> 01:29.600
Okay.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.000
16 screens of pleasure there.

01:32.000 --> 01:32.320
Oh, wow.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.760
I was just going to run down-

01:33.760 --> 01:39.760
Hey, just real quick, Justin. 16 screens of pleasure doesn't sound great.

01:39.760 --> 01:43.200
No, it sounds like they're showing a lot of smut.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.920
Well, let's take a look because I thought this would be a good way of figuring out what to do

01:47.920 --> 01:49.040
a watch on.

01:49.040 --> 01:49.280
Okay.

01:49.280 --> 01:53.600
Because like, if you think about it, it's weird because there's- there ain't movies.

01:53.600 --> 01:53.680
No.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.320
You know what I mean?

01:54.320 --> 01:54.320
No.

01:54.320 --> 01:58.080
I mean, there's no movies, but they are opening up the theaters to show-

01:58.960 --> 02:00.720
I mean, there's no movies. Here's the great news.

02:00.720 --> 02:05.120
Movies gave us Scoob, and they're like, that's going to tide them over for a while.

02:05.120 --> 02:05.440
Yep.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.320
First type Trolls World Tour.

02:08.320 --> 02:08.640
Gotta get it.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.080
That's- I mean, got it.

02:10.080 --> 02:10.400
Got it.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.360
That was the last movie. We were in the last movie, which seems huge.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.320
Bloodshot. Great. Love Vin.

02:16.880 --> 02:20.320
Invisible Man and Sonic the Hedgehog.

02:20.960 --> 02:21.680
Now those-

02:21.680 --> 02:22.000
Hold on tight.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.080
Those I know I've seen at my house. Those have been at my house for a little bit.

02:26.080 --> 02:26.320
Gripping tight.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.200
As well as Fantasy Island.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.280
Gripping tight to the edge. Not letting go.

02:29.280 --> 02:34.320
So this is what- then they're like, well, man, we got a lot of screens.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.320
Dang, I wish we hadn't put up those many screens.

02:36.320 --> 02:40.160
Maybe Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is going to play three times.

02:40.160 --> 02:40.640
Thrice.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.720
And once you finish that screening, you can go check out Jurassic Park.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.000
The original Jurassic Park.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.680
Those dinos are back.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.600
You thought they were extinct, but they're back.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.080
Listen, here's the thing.

02:56.080 --> 03:00.560
That is simultaneously ridiculous, but also there's a part of me that's like,

03:00.560 --> 03:02.160
ooh, back on the big screen, huh?

03:02.160 --> 03:04.000
Well, do you feel that way about this?

03:05.840 --> 03:08.160
Maybe you'll go, Travis, and you'll have the time of your life,

03:08.160 --> 03:11.440
which is deliciously appropriate because we're going to head on over

03:11.440 --> 03:13.840
and check out Dirty Dancing at 530.

03:13.840 --> 03:14.640
Oh, wow.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.720
Really make a day of it and enjoy.

03:16.720 --> 03:19.680
Let me risk my health, life, and lung capacity

03:19.680 --> 03:22.720
to catch a big, big, big performance of Dirty Dancing.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.240
Sounds cool.

03:24.240 --> 03:28.080
Just to clarify, Justin, are they charging money for this?

03:28.080 --> 03:29.440
Yeah, just the regular prices.

03:29.440 --> 03:33.600
Griffin, you may risk your life and limb, but you will never say die

03:33.600 --> 03:38.080
because at 820, we're going to go over and see a screening of The Goonies.

03:38.080 --> 03:41.520
The Goonies, let's make it a double feature of adventure

03:41.520 --> 03:44.480
with Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark

03:44.480 --> 03:47.760
showing six times today.

03:47.760 --> 03:51.520
You will have six opportunities to see Indiana Jones

03:51.520 --> 03:53.440
and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.840
Now, Justin, I'm now looking at the website, too,

03:55.840 --> 03:57.680
and I see on one of the screens they're showing

03:57.680 --> 03:59.520
that black and white silent movie

03:59.520 --> 04:02.960
where the train came out the screen and everyone dove out of the way.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.960
You ain't that fucking far off, Trav,

04:04.960 --> 04:08.080
because the last movie showing is The Wizard of Oz.

04:08.080 --> 04:08.880
Wow.

04:08.880 --> 04:17.120
Yeah, if you've just been 80 years too late on this one, on this 1939 flick,

04:17.120 --> 04:20.720
you can finally check out The Lion and the Scarecrow

04:20.720 --> 04:22.400
and all of their great adventures.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.200
Metal Man.

04:23.200 --> 04:28.000
You can have three chances to see Wizard of Oz.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.120
I mean, I guess we could do Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets watch.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.160
It feels bad.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.680
It feels bad.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.200
This is a national chain.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.240
There is going to be someone who is like,

04:42.240 --> 04:43.440
well, I got the COVID.

04:43.440 --> 04:43.840
Dang it.

04:43.840 --> 04:44.720
I got the COVID.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.280
And someone's like, how did you get the COVID?

04:47.280 --> 04:50.240
It's like, well, I just wanted to enjoy all two hours

04:50.240 --> 04:53.520
and 41 minutes of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

04:53.520 --> 04:56.080
on the big screen as it was intended.

04:56.080 --> 04:59.520
You know, I've never gotten into Harry Potter before.

04:59.520 --> 05:00.720
Never been a fan.

05:00.720 --> 05:05.040
But now it feels like the best time to do it.

05:05.040 --> 05:09.280
And you forced both your grandpas and grandmas to go to it with you.

05:09.280 --> 05:09.680
Fuck you.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.280
It's got Kenneth Branagh.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.000
You don't know.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.920
They need this.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.360
I'm taking Meemaw and Peppa to see The Goonies.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.400
They didn't even start.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.160
They didn't even show Sorcerer's Stone.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.320
They were like, oh, you know what?

05:22.320 --> 05:23.920
People are just going to start right here.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.680
We'll start them at two.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.480
The one with Kenneth fucking Branagh in it.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.920
Travis, there's a global pandemic.

05:29.920 --> 05:32.800
No one's going to sit through the first Harry Potter movie.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.840
You got to skip to two.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.440
This is an advice show where we try to help you.

05:37.440 --> 05:38.640
Here's my advice.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.400
Don't go to the fucking movies.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.360
No, you know what you should do instead?

05:41.360 --> 05:42.480
You absolute maniacs.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.120
You know what you should do instead?

05:45.120 --> 05:45.680
What, Travis?

05:45.680 --> 05:50.400
Get my brother and me on streaming or on iTunes or wherever you want.

05:50.400 --> 05:50.880
Well, that.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.000
Watch that TV show.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.920
Also, I was about to give my brothers a quiz,

05:53.920 --> 05:55.760
so you could just play along at home.

05:55.760 --> 05:56.400
Oh, my God.

05:57.760 --> 05:58.640
This is heartbreaking.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.400
You guys, because you can play along at home

06:00.400 --> 06:02.480
in the safety of your own home.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.120
Travis, stop.

06:05.120 --> 06:09.520
It's the way he does it now, Juice, where he's like, oh, shucks.

06:09.520 --> 06:13.360
Yeah, it's like you can tell he's not actually cranking it,

06:13.360 --> 06:15.280
but he would if he fucking could.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.720
Do you want to hear something monstrous?

06:16.720 --> 06:18.800
Travis is the one that finds the questions

06:18.800 --> 06:22.000
and sends them to me to ask, and he hasn't done it.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.920
So I have no recourse.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.040
I have him sitting right here.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.880
I'll send him to you.

06:28.880 --> 06:29.760
I have nothing.

06:29.760 --> 06:30.800
I have no recourse.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.800
But first, I thought maybe we could play along at home.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.360
No, we don't.

06:35.360 --> 06:35.840
Just do it.

06:35.840 --> 06:36.320
Just start.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.440
Yeah, you keep saying it,

06:37.440 --> 06:40.000
but it's just making that bit longer every time you say it.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.600
Now, correct me if I'm wrong.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.600
Do you guys like video games?

06:44.480 --> 06:44.880
I do.

06:44.880 --> 06:45.840
He just got me there.

06:45.840 --> 06:46.880
He got me dead to rights.

06:46.880 --> 06:47.600
I love me a video game.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.560
You like video games?

06:49.440 --> 06:51.600
I picked some video games questions

06:51.600 --> 06:54.160
because I know in the past they've been a little too tough

06:54.720 --> 06:56.480
and I wanted to give you guys a chance.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.200
Now I'm worried.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.560
I will say that as I did this,

06:58.560 --> 07:02.160
both of you are video games aficionados,

07:03.200 --> 07:04.480
and there's a part of me that's worried

07:04.480 --> 07:05.840
that you'll know all the answers,

07:05.840 --> 07:09.280
but I thought it would still be fun for those at home.

07:09.280 --> 07:09.760
Probably not.

07:09.760 --> 07:10.640
Let's try it, though.

07:10.640 --> 07:14.080
And let's just make a new Google promise.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.360
I always make a new Google promise.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.600
Travis, please talk as fast as you possibly can.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.360
Justin, same to you, because I'll be doing the same.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.800
Okay, well, I'm killing time now

07:20.800 --> 07:22.320
so I can send the questions to Justin

07:22.320 --> 07:23.280
because I forgot to do that.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.080
But here we go.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.720
So, let's see.

07:26.720 --> 07:27.440
Who wants to go first?

07:27.440 --> 07:28.880
Who wants the first question?

07:28.880 --> 07:30.000
It doesn't matter.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.040
Okay, Justin.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.360
Before settling on the name Sonic,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.720
what was the name proposed by Sega

07:36.720 --> 07:38.800
for this iconic blue hedgehog?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.760
He was originally called Mr. Needlemouse.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.120
That is correct.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.000
Thank you.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.360
How the fuck do you know that?

07:46.160 --> 07:49.680
I read a book, Console Wars, if you ever read that one.

07:49.680 --> 07:50.400
Okay, fine.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.000
Where they talk about the design.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.080
He originally was also much more radical

07:54.080 --> 07:55.520
and had a lot of toot.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.020
Yeah.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.040
And he wasn't inherently fast.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.120
It was his sneakers that were fast.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.400
He had no inherent superpowers.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.680
Who cares?

08:03.680 --> 08:04.480
Needlemouse is,

08:05.280 --> 08:07.440
if you literally translate the Japanese word for hedgehog,

08:07.440 --> 08:08.960
that's what it is, Needlemouse.

08:08.960 --> 08:11.200
Now, Griffin, this is a more recent game.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.560
Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.120
Well, hold on, hold on.

08:15.120 --> 08:15.620
Okay.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.920
I could ask you a Crash Bandicoot question, but I won't.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.000
How'd you say that?

08:22.000 --> 08:22.500
What?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.400
Well, do you know what Crash Bandicoot

08:24.400 --> 08:25.680
was originally meant to be?

08:25.680 --> 08:27.040
Say the second word in his name.

08:27.680 --> 08:28.480
Crash Bandicoot.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.520
I'm pretty sure you were saying Bandicoot, which-

08:32.560 --> 08:33.600
Bandicoot.

08:33.600 --> 08:33.920
Okay.

08:33.920 --> 08:34.720
See, he's doing it.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.000
He's doing it intentionally now.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.720
Assassin's Creed was originally set to be part

08:38.720 --> 08:40.800
of what video game franchise?

08:40.800 --> 08:41.840
He's got this.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.600
It's not funny or good.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.080
I don't know.

08:44.880 --> 08:45.840
Prince of Persia.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.760
Yeah, Prince of Persia.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.640
It was originally going to be

08:48.640 --> 08:50.000
Prince of Persia Assassin's.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.680
This is the worst one yet, guys.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.520
That is an interesting fact.

08:53.520 --> 08:54.720
Very interesting.

08:54.720 --> 08:55.840
You didn't know it.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.520
Interesting gamer facts.

08:58.400 --> 08:58.880
Justin.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.280
We're talking about fucking, no, we're talking about

09:01.280 --> 09:02.800
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

09:02.800 --> 09:03.840
and giving out gamer facts.

09:03.840 --> 09:04.960
How far are we into the episode?

09:05.520 --> 09:06.000
Scrap it.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.800
Justin.

09:06.800 --> 09:07.280
Scrap it.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.320
Yeah.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.920
In transferring Super Mario Kart-

09:09.920 --> 09:11.360
This is the best of episode week.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.960
I'm going to pull some of the best episodes

09:13.600 --> 09:17.040
from episode 200 to 250 and you guys do 250 to 300.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.320
We'll pull some funny fucking clips

09:18.320 --> 09:18.880
and we'll put up a-

09:18.880 --> 09:21.840
In transferring Super Mario Kart to Western markets,

09:21.840 --> 09:25.520
what censorship was done on Princess Peach and Bowser?

09:26.720 --> 09:29.360
They removed, they made Bowser's dick smaller.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.400
Well, they did do that,

09:30.400 --> 09:31.680
but also the answer I was looking for

09:31.680 --> 09:35.680
is they removed champagne from their victory celebrations.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.520
Oh, okay, and the dick thing.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.480
And the dick thing.

09:38.480 --> 09:38.880
Griffin.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.240
Huge scaly hog.

09:41.120 --> 09:41.680
Griffin.

09:41.680 --> 09:42.240
Big fucking Koopa balls.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.800
The entire game of The Legend of Zelda,

09:44.800 --> 09:48.160
A Link to the Past, takes up how much memory?

09:48.160 --> 09:50.000
I'm going to say 16 megabytes.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.120
What?

09:51.120 --> 09:52.560
Less than one megabyte.

09:53.280 --> 09:53.760
Wow.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.400
Cool.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.040
Wow.

09:55.040 --> 09:55.760
Justin.

09:55.760 --> 09:56.320
Fuck yeah.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.200
The UK versions of-

09:57.200 --> 09:58.480
Fucking cool.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.960
Fucking cool.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.400
Fucking radical, baby.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.000
Justin.

10:06.000 --> 10:06.800
The UK versions-

10:06.800 --> 10:10.320
Fucking gamers rise up and eat these fucking facts.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.640
Fucking E3's not dead.

10:14.640 --> 10:18.400
Gamers, it's right here in the fucking studio, baby.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.840
This sucks shit.

10:21.840 --> 10:26.720
The UK versions of FIFA 2001 and Gran Turismo 2

10:26.720 --> 10:29.680
shipped with what peculiar feature?

10:29.680 --> 10:31.600
Wings on both.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.720
There's wings on the cars, wings on the players, lots of wings.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.880
They had scratch and sniff discs.

10:37.840 --> 10:42.640
If you scratched FIFA's disc, you could, quote, smell the pitch.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.080
The stink of the pitch.

10:44.080 --> 10:48.800
And rubbing Gran Turismo's 2 disc would deliver an authentic pit stop smell.

10:48.800 --> 10:52.080
I wish you could scratch and sniff this episode of Mabim Bam

10:52.080 --> 10:54.320
and it would smell like a dead body.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.760
Because it sucks and reeks.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.120
This question is for both of you.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.720
For both of us, Griff.

11:04.720 --> 11:07.360
In a guerrilla style marketing campaign-

11:07.920 --> 11:08.480
Killzone.

11:08.480 --> 11:15.360
Spoof prostitute-style cards were placed in phone boxes around Soho in London

11:15.360 --> 11:18.320
to advertise the original Crash Bandicoot.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.360
What did they read?

11:20.720 --> 11:22.240
Randy the Dandy, Randy Coot.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.480
Not too far off.

11:24.480 --> 11:29.280
They read, quote, new in town, young Randy Bandicoot.

11:29.280 --> 11:29.680
That was fucking close.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.520
And then it had a phone number you could call

11:31.520 --> 11:33.760
and a picture of Crash in his underpants.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.160
I think you should get a half point for that.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.760
Yeah, I'll give Griffin a half point for that.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.360
Okay, what's the final score, Travis?

11:39.360 --> 11:40.160
Justin wins.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.080
Yay!

11:42.080 --> 11:44.080
When I was in my junior year of high school-

11:44.080 --> 11:45.520
Oh, we can celebrate longer.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.840
Hold on, I don't feel like we really celebrated as long as we could.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.360
When I was in my junior year of high school,

11:49.360 --> 11:51.680
I went on a camping trip with some of my class.

11:51.680 --> 11:54.000
On one of the nights, I woke up having to pee

11:54.000 --> 11:56.160
more than I've ever had to piss ever.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.840
I mean, breaking of the Hoover Dam piss.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.560
Okay, we know how much piss is.

12:00.560 --> 12:01.600
God, you have to pee.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.360
I tried to wake a friend up-

12:03.360 --> 12:05.200
No, stop, we're gonna tear this up.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.760
If you had to piss the breaking of the Hoover Dam,

12:07.760 --> 12:10.800
your body would be torn apart by the internal pressure.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.040
So don't say shit unless it's real.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.800
This is my favorite thing about starting an episode

12:14.800 --> 12:17.840
with Play Along at Home, is Griffin gets real feisty.

12:17.840 --> 12:18.640
Yeah, real worked up.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.240
For everyone else's questions.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.320
We actually cut out Play Along at Home,

12:22.320 --> 12:24.160
but we just harnessed Griffin's energy

12:24.160 --> 12:24.720
for the rest of the episode.

12:24.720 --> 12:25.440
You cut it out?

12:26.640 --> 12:29.040
I tried to wake a friend up, but she didn't get up.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.600
So I barely made it to a teacher's tent

12:31.600 --> 12:34.160
when the moment she answered me, the dams broke.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.880
I pissed my pants in the middle of the woods

12:36.880 --> 12:38.320
and everyone knew about it.

12:38.320 --> 12:39.680
Literally everyone.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.640
That being said, it's currently three eventful years later

12:42.640 --> 12:44.640
and I'm talking about recently the best friend

12:44.640 --> 12:46.080
and he told me he forgot about it.

12:46.080 --> 12:47.280
No, he didn't.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.320
Nope, he didn't.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.920
So my question is, how do I ask people

12:51.920 --> 12:53.840
if they remember this without reminding them

12:53.840 --> 12:55.200
of the terrible accident?

12:55.840 --> 12:59.760
I think about this every single day

12:59.760 --> 13:00.880
and that's Pee Pee McGee.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.200
Remember when you shit your pants during Papa's funeral?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.720
Nah, man, I forgot.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.520
That's funny, I forgot about when you shit your pants

13:07.520 --> 13:08.800
at my Papa's funeral.

13:08.800 --> 13:09.840
That's weird.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.120
Yeah, it did happen, didn't it?

13:11.120 --> 13:12.240
No one would forget.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.120
The things I remember in my life

13:16.320 --> 13:18.560
with perfect clarity and will until the day

13:18.560 --> 13:19.920
I pass off this mortal coil.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.920
One, every time I've seen someone pee their pants.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.400
Two, every time I've seen someone fall down

13:24.400 --> 13:25.520
and I mean really fall down.

13:25.520 --> 13:26.960
Really get a good fall going.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.600
Even saying it,

13:29.600 --> 13:33.680
you're thinking about a treasured memory you have

13:33.680 --> 13:35.920
of watching someone absolutely pee fit.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.080
Dude, I saw a serious bonk one time

13:38.080 --> 13:40.800
that I just think about all the fucking time.

13:41.680 --> 13:45.200
It's hard trying to do comedy, a comedy podcast,

13:45.200 --> 13:47.600
and realizing you're never gonna do anything as funny

13:47.600 --> 13:49.120
as just seeing someone fall.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.680
Really eat the cheddar.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.120
Not get hurt, not get hurt.

13:53.120 --> 13:53.840
Not get hurt.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.920
A little hurt, but not like they break something

13:55.920 --> 13:57.840
or like they get up right away,

13:57.840 --> 14:01.360
but maybe they were running too fast with a backpack on

14:01.360 --> 14:01.920
and they don't calibrate.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.840
It needs to be bad enough that they,

14:03.840 --> 14:05.680
for a second, aren't a person.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.360
Do you know what I'm saying?

14:07.360 --> 14:08.880
For a second, they're just like,

14:08.880 --> 14:10.080
oh, did you plan that?

14:10.080 --> 14:11.200
That was cartoonish.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.880
I was like, no, I didn't plan it.

14:12.880 --> 14:13.760
I'm bleeding.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.840
I was running down a short grassy slope

14:15.840 --> 14:18.400
outside of a Waffle House on my way to King's Island once

14:18.400 --> 14:20.720
and my feet just, whoop,

14:20.720 --> 14:23.280
and I landed ass first on a metal grate

14:23.280 --> 14:25.120
and had to go to the emergency room

14:25.120 --> 14:28.080
because I couldn't move

14:28.080 --> 14:29.360
and I didn't get to go to King's Island,

14:29.360 --> 14:32.480
but I do, like I know my friends were worried about me,

14:32.480 --> 14:34.000
but I do hope while they were enjoying

14:34.000 --> 14:35.280
the King's Island rides and stuff,

14:35.280 --> 14:38.960
they thought about the truly spectacular spill that I took

14:38.960 --> 14:40.960
and hopefully will never forget about it.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.560
And that's a sacrifice I'll make for my friends.

14:43.120 --> 14:46.320
One time I was coming home from Sidney's parents' house

14:46.320 --> 14:50.720
and I brought my Xbox, original Xbox,

14:50.720 --> 14:52.880
original ass Xbox over there.

14:52.880 --> 14:56.400
And then I was going up the stairs to walk into the house

14:56.960 --> 15:01.280
and I tripped on the stairs and sent the Xbox flying

15:01.280 --> 15:03.760
and also hit my knee so bad

15:03.760 --> 15:06.320
that blood started coming out of it

15:06.320 --> 15:09.040
and I live in perpetual sadness

15:09.040 --> 15:12.320
that I could not see that amazing sight.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.120
You know what I mean?

15:13.120 --> 15:15.360
Like if I could ever astral project

15:15.360 --> 15:16.880
just to see that one moment

15:16.880 --> 15:18.000
because I think I would,

15:18.000 --> 15:19.280
I'm sure Sidney treasures it.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.920
She denies it, but I would love,

15:21.920 --> 15:24.000
I would just love to have that captured

15:24.800 --> 15:26.400
in America's Funniest Home Memories

15:26.400 --> 15:27.520
up there in the bank.

15:27.520 --> 15:28.960
Can I ask you a question?

15:28.960 --> 15:29.360
Yeah, buddy.

15:29.360 --> 15:33.920
Did you make any kind of like audible vocal noise?

15:33.920 --> 15:35.680
Yeah, how many do you think you did?

15:35.680 --> 15:37.120
Like, whoa!

15:37.120 --> 15:39.120
Were you like, Master Chief, no!

15:41.600 --> 15:42.720
My bandicoot!

15:43.440 --> 15:44.640
Nah, not on the Xbox.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.960
It's a funny word.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.120
Come on, maybe Blink's the time sweeper.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.280
Yeah, that's what you tend to do.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.480
I've never fallen down.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.240
Ever, yeah, that's true.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.360
I don't know.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.640
I've never seen Travis fall down.

15:56.640 --> 15:57.840
Let me just put this out there

15:57.840 --> 15:59.040
and let people-

15:59.040 --> 16:00.240
What if we've been like,

16:00.240 --> 16:02.240
why do we fall down, Master Bruce?

16:02.240 --> 16:04.240
And he's like, I never fucking fell down.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.680
I'm unfallable, dude.

16:05.680 --> 16:06.320
You tell me.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.400
You old bastard, why you fall down?

16:10.400 --> 16:12.000
Why do you fall down?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.160
No, I was saying, Master Bruce,

16:14.160 --> 16:15.680
no, why do you fall down?

16:15.680 --> 16:16.560
I gave you a,

16:16.560 --> 16:18.160
I had to give you a portable basketball

16:18.160 --> 16:20.080
for when you fell down in the kitchen.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.400
I had to go down for fighting the Joker

16:22.400 --> 16:23.760
to come help you back up.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.680
Do you fall down so many times, Alfred?

16:25.680 --> 16:26.240
I'm bad at it.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.920
If I fall down, I just put my arms out

16:27.920 --> 16:28.960
and boom, I'm out.

16:28.960 --> 16:29.520
You know what I mean?

16:30.160 --> 16:31.040
Do you know how bad it is?

16:31.040 --> 16:32.880
I gave the penguin my home address

16:32.880 --> 16:34.160
so if I'm ever out of town,

16:34.160 --> 16:35.840
he can come help you stand back up, Alfred,

16:35.840 --> 16:37.600
because you fall all the time and I hate it.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.840
I'm gonna put this mantra out there

16:39.840 --> 16:41.520
and whoever needs it, use it.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.280
So you pissed your pants.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.000
Yeah.

16:44.000 --> 16:44.720
So what?

16:45.280 --> 16:46.160
So what?

16:46.160 --> 16:48.480
You make a mess in someone's car,

16:48.480 --> 16:49.040
you clean it up.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.240
That's like worst case scenario.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.520
So you piss your pants.

16:52.080 --> 16:52.960
It's just water?

16:54.160 --> 16:56.240
That is one thing that I'll never forget

16:56.240 --> 16:57.520
is when our friend Justin

16:58.320 --> 17:00.400
drunkenly had a very large-

17:00.400 --> 17:01.120
I'm your brother.

17:01.120 --> 17:01.920
No, not my brother.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.320
Let's have like an extra large 7-Up

17:04.320 --> 17:06.480
from McDonald's in the back of Griffin's car

17:07.440 --> 17:08.480
and dropped it,

17:08.480 --> 17:10.400
spilling the entirety of it

17:10.400 --> 17:13.040
and just said, I made a nut-o.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.480
Yeah, that sucked, man.

17:14.480 --> 17:14.880
That was a-

17:14.880 --> 17:15.760
I do think about that.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.440
But we have a good time talking about that.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.080
No, we didn't.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.960
There was a fucking half inch of standing Sprite

17:20.960 --> 17:22.720
in the backseat of my fucking car.

17:22.720 --> 17:23.360
It was terrible.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.280
There is a certain-

17:27.600 --> 17:29.120
I've learned this since I've had kids.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.720
I've had a lot more time to think about this

17:30.720 --> 17:31.760
and a lot more opportunity.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.960
There's a certain drink size

17:34.960 --> 17:36.880
where if it spills in your car,

17:36.880 --> 17:38.960
it's kind of unfathomable.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.040
Like there's a certain drink size where

17:41.040 --> 17:41.760
if that's-

17:41.760 --> 17:42.640
I think there's something like,

17:42.640 --> 17:44.480
if that spills, that's it for me.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.000
That's the car.

17:46.000 --> 17:46.560
That's no-

17:46.560 --> 17:48.800
Yeah, no, I don't have this car anymore.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.720
It belongs to the Mr. Misty Slush at this point.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.200
Hey, can I do a Yahoo that was sent in?

17:55.200 --> 17:56.480
Can we help this person?

17:56.480 --> 17:57.440
Yeah, don't worry about it.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.400
It's not a big deal.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.080
So you pissed your pants.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.600
So you pissed your pants.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.880
Hey, I have a Yahoo here.

18:02.880 --> 18:03.520
And this one was sent in-

18:03.520 --> 18:04.320
You do?

18:04.320 --> 18:04.560
Okay.

18:04.560 --> 18:05.360
Oh my goodness.

18:05.360 --> 18:05.680
All right.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.120
This one was sent in by a bunch of people.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.480
It was sent in by Adrian Cowles first.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.120
Thank you, Adrian.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.960
It's Yahoo Answers user iam,

18:10.960 --> 18:13.440
which is like ian, but with an m.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.160
Who asks-

18:14.160 --> 18:16.160
Or like Liam, but without an l.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.920
Or like Liam without an l.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.880
Or like Chris without the Chris and plus iam.

18:20.880 --> 18:21.840
Yeah, sure.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.240
So anyway, he says,

18:24.960 --> 18:27.440
why are old books so boring?

18:28.000 --> 18:28.480
Thank you.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.120
Books from several centuries back

18:31.120 --> 18:32.400
are objectively less entertaining

18:32.400 --> 18:33.760
and fun to read than modern books.

18:33.760 --> 18:35.280
I would think that few people would consider

18:35.280 --> 18:36.560
Shakespeare actually interesting

18:36.560 --> 18:39.200
if they thought he wrote his plays 10 years ago.

18:39.200 --> 18:39.840
Why is that?

18:39.840 --> 18:42.000
Were people simply bad at writing in the past

18:42.000 --> 18:44.480
the way we were bad at medicine?

18:44.480 --> 18:46.480
Did people not care to make their books enjoyable?

18:46.480 --> 18:48.320
Is there a rational explanation for it?

18:48.320 --> 18:49.920
A update two days ago.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.960
Shakespeare is a bad example of what I am trying to ask.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.280
Think of Dickens or Russian classics.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.960
So they definitely like walked it back just a little bit.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.520
Okay, I'll relit on Shakespeare.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.480
Okay, all right.

19:02.480 --> 19:03.040
Here's the thing.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.440
Shakespeare's got some murder, stabbing,

19:05.440 --> 19:07.920
all kinds of witchcraft, dope shit, sex,

19:08.560 --> 19:10.560
jugs, dingle dangles,

19:10.560 --> 19:12.080
all kinds of fucking dope shit.

19:13.280 --> 19:16.080
But Dickens, snalore.

19:16.080 --> 19:19.280
I do feel like they walked it back too soon

19:19.280 --> 19:21.840
because the point of if Shakespeare

19:21.840 --> 19:24.400
was like publishing these works 10 years ago,

19:24.400 --> 19:25.680
I do think there'd be people like,

19:25.680 --> 19:26.640
what is this shit?

19:27.440 --> 19:29.520
I don't fucking understand this at all.

19:29.520 --> 19:32.480
I was reading Dostoevsky and my nuts fell asleep

19:32.480 --> 19:33.680
because of how I was sitting.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.680
I was so fucking bored reading this dumb book.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.600
Now Dickens is a bad example too though

19:37.600 --> 19:40.400
because there's ghosts and there's an old lady

19:40.400 --> 19:43.120
in a wedding dress with some old ass cake sitting around.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.960
Orphans!

19:44.960 --> 19:45.920
There's orphans.

19:45.920 --> 19:46.800
That's interesting.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.640
I think there's a guillotine.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.600
That's so cool.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.680
Crime orphans?

19:51.680 --> 19:53.040
Come on, that's cool though.

19:53.040 --> 19:56.400
I mean, if you can make a movie with singing dogs

19:56.400 --> 19:59.920
with songs by Billy Joel in it based on the work,

19:59.920 --> 20:02.560
I don't think you can be like, that dude's boring.

20:02.560 --> 20:07.520
All right, we've had a lot of fun taking the piss.

20:07.520 --> 20:08.800
Out of this Yahoo Answers user.

20:08.800 --> 20:13.360
But I can mention Dostoevsky in here

20:13.360 --> 20:16.000
and say that name because I think it makes me sound smart.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.320
Have I read Crime and Punishment?

20:18.320 --> 20:19.600
Fuck no, it's boring.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.120
Have I read Animorphs?

20:21.120 --> 20:22.160
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

20:22.160 --> 20:22.880
Yup.

20:22.880 --> 20:23.760
I've read a lot of Animorphs.

20:23.760 --> 20:27.520
I just wanna, can I applaud you for twice saying that name

20:27.520 --> 20:29.920
with the confidence that you're pronouncing it correctly

20:29.920 --> 20:31.600
in a way that I simply could not.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.100
Yeah.

20:33.280 --> 20:36.800
I bought the Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.360
Nice.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.840
And my wife and I were gonna read it together

20:40.880 --> 20:42.080
as part of this thing.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.320
This is even before I have kids, so no excuse.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.160
We're gonna read it as part of this book club,

20:46.160 --> 20:47.280
online book club deal.

20:47.280 --> 20:47.680
Nerd.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.640
And we met, we bought two exact same copies

20:50.640 --> 20:54.240
and we both made it like exactly 40 pages in

20:54.240 --> 20:56.400
and then promptly put it back up on the shelf

20:56.400 --> 20:58.160
and they sit next to each other.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.920
And it's worse because it's twice,

21:00.880 --> 21:02.000
it's twice the book.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.640
It's the twin Brothers Karamazov.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.760
It can't just, because there's two,

21:08.480 --> 21:10.880
they can't just fade into memory

21:10.880 --> 21:12.560
because every time I look at the books,

21:12.560 --> 21:15.120
there's two of these fuckers next to each other

21:15.120 --> 21:17.280
and I had to take that walk back or I'm like,

21:17.840 --> 21:19.840
fucking, what was I thinking?

21:19.840 --> 21:20.960
40 pages.

21:20.960 --> 21:24.880
And to this day, some 15 years later,

21:24.880 --> 21:26.080
Sydney and I'll be looking at books

21:26.080 --> 21:29.200
and I'll still be like, we gotta get back to Brothers Karamazov.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.760
You remember where we were when we left off, right?

21:31.760 --> 21:32.720
What was happening?

21:32.720 --> 21:37.520
I still, there is like a couple of points that are raised.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.800
I'll say, I'll give an example.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.440
One of the characters in Brothers Karamazov says,

21:43.120 --> 21:46.160
the more that I love humanity generally,

21:46.720 --> 21:50.320
the more that I find that I cannot stand individual people.

21:50.320 --> 21:53.040
That's fucking so dope and fresh.

21:53.040 --> 21:53.840
And it's powerful.

21:53.840 --> 21:54.800
It stood out in my mind.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.640
That's in the first 40 pages.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.480
I don't know what incredible power,

21:58.480 --> 22:04.960
what life-changing nuggets beyond that lie before me.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.040
I couldn't do it, so many nicknames.

22:07.040 --> 22:10.080
No one has read, I would pause it.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.440
The thicker the book,

22:11.440 --> 22:14.640
the less chance there is that anyone has read it to completion.

22:14.640 --> 22:17.200
And the thing is that they keep selling

22:17.200 --> 22:20.480
so that people will, like yourself, put them on shelves.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.600
I've been in a lot of Zoom calls lately

22:23.600 --> 22:26.000
where I've seen a lot of bookshelves in the background

22:26.000 --> 22:28.800
and there's a lot of unbroken spines in there

22:28.800 --> 22:30.480
with big fancy names on them.

22:31.280 --> 22:35.200
I mean, no one has actually read Dostoevsky to completion

22:35.200 --> 22:36.960
because reading that fucking dude's books

22:36.960 --> 22:38.240
makes my nuts fall asleep.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.480
But I couldn't even finish.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.200
If you know what I mean,

22:41.200 --> 22:42.480
now you know who gets me every time,

22:42.480 --> 22:43.760
he's K.A. Applegate.

22:43.760 --> 22:44.720
I'll tell you what I remember,

22:44.720 --> 22:46.480
Tobias turned into a fucking hawk too long.

22:46.480 --> 22:49.040
Yeah dude, that's cultural touchstone.

22:49.040 --> 22:49.440
Thank you.

22:49.440 --> 22:50.080
So I've read a lot of them.

22:50.080 --> 22:50.880
You know what I love?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.640
R. L. Stein.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.360
Yes.

22:55.360 --> 22:56.720
He's got the puppets,

22:56.720 --> 22:59.360
the puppets talk can come alive in the spooky.

22:59.360 --> 23:02.960
I saw the movie Count of Monte Cristo

23:02.960 --> 23:05.680
with Jim Cavieviso and I thought,

23:05.680 --> 23:07.840
what a cool, this is a cool thing.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.360
I need to read this book.

23:09.360 --> 23:10.720
I started reading the book

23:10.720 --> 23:13.200
and I got about 100 pages in and I was like,

23:13.200 --> 23:16.080
wait a minute, this isn't the Dante that I know.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.600
This isn't, what is happening?

23:17.600 --> 23:18.560
This is boring.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.040
This book is quite different from the movie

23:21.040 --> 23:22.160
that I enjoyed so much.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.440
Now here's the thing, I will tell you,

23:23.440 --> 23:24.480
I finished it.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.880
I read that book and I am impressed with myself

23:26.880 --> 23:28.080
and you should be too.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.920
But it is, in many ways,

23:30.480 --> 23:33.520
way more boring than the Jim Cavieviso movie.

23:33.520 --> 23:34.020
Sure.

23:34.720 --> 23:35.840
And way longer.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.400
I did the Jim Cavieviso movie in like an hour 50.

23:38.400 --> 23:38.800
Cranked it up.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.600
The book, that was like six months of reading.

23:41.600 --> 23:41.840
Yeah.

23:42.800 --> 23:43.520
That's the problem.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.680
Okay, I'll give you an example, okay?

23:48.800 --> 23:50.720
Leather Stocking Tales, right?

23:50.720 --> 23:52.960
James Fenimore Cooper's Leather Stocking Tales.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.480
You got Deer Slayer Last Mohican.

23:54.480 --> 23:55.200
Sounds sexy.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.560
Yeah, the other ones, right?

23:56.560 --> 24:00.240
You try to read that, it's unthinkable.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.160
It's unthinkable.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.600
It's so terrible.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.680
I'll give you an example, okay?

24:06.960 --> 24:09.520
Leather Stocking Tales is about Natty Bumppo,

24:09.520 --> 24:11.280
which rules, I'll give him that.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.040
Natty Bumppo is fucking good.

24:13.600 --> 24:17.440
But then he's known in these books as

24:17.440 --> 24:20.720
Leather Stocking, the Pathfinder, the Trapper,

24:20.720 --> 24:24.880
Deer Slayer, Le Long Carabine,

24:24.880 --> 24:28.000
which is Long Rifle in French, and Hawkeye.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.680
Those are all names for him.

24:29.680 --> 24:32.160
You know how many names Judge Dredd needs?

24:32.160 --> 24:32.480
One.

24:33.120 --> 24:33.600
Right.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.240
Because he kicks ass and he's just Judge Dredd.

24:36.240 --> 24:37.600
And that's what his name is.

24:37.600 --> 24:38.960
And then he goes out there and rules.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.640
He doesn't need eight other names.

24:40.640 --> 24:47.920
They're not like, oh no, the Mr. Bigelaw.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.600
No one has to call him Mr. Bigelaw.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.680
Because he doesn't need a bunch of names.

24:51.680 --> 24:52.400
Right.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.440
I remember, I think it was Deer Slayer,

24:55.440 --> 24:57.440
having to read that for a summer reading program.

24:57.440 --> 25:01.360
And the first page is, as far as I can recall,

25:01.360 --> 25:05.040
a nonstop run-on sentence that is just one date.

25:07.040 --> 25:10.400
There was a war on this date, and it's just so dense

25:10.400 --> 25:14.160
that I had to reread that one page 18 times.

25:14.160 --> 25:17.120
And I specifically remember, at 17 years old,

25:17.120 --> 25:21.200
being like, oh, OK, not setting me up for success here,

25:21.200 --> 25:22.800
James Pinnimore Cooper.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.680
Oh, boy, you couldn't start off with, I don't know,

25:25.680 --> 25:27.360
a sunrise or something.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.920
Give me some kind of, no, you're just starting off

25:29.920 --> 25:31.760
with a history lesson.

25:31.760 --> 25:32.800
Oh, boy.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.800
I remember reading Wuthering Heights,

25:34.800 --> 25:36.560
and it just kind of ended.

25:36.560 --> 25:40.240
And I remember being 16 and being like, this sucks.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.680
I'm throwing it down.

25:41.680 --> 25:44.560
That fucking Heathcliff dude, he doesn't terrorize

25:44.560 --> 25:46.320
the neighborhood at all.

25:46.320 --> 25:46.560
No.

25:46.560 --> 25:49.360
And then when he does, it is just gaslighting

25:49.360 --> 25:51.200
and psychological and not fun.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.000
It's not pranks.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.120
Here is how to free yourself.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.280
And I have actually used this specific technique

25:57.280 --> 25:58.400
that I'm going to share with you.

25:59.680 --> 26:03.200
What you do is, if there's a fancy old writer

26:03.200 --> 26:05.200
that you think you should be reading,

26:05.200 --> 26:09.040
you feel guilty about it, find another also good writer

26:09.760 --> 26:11.760
that takes shit on them.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.320
And then it frees you from, I'll give you an example.

26:14.320 --> 26:17.120
There is actually a pretty famous piece called

26:17.120 --> 26:20.720
Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses by Mark Twain.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.040
And Mark Twain writes a whole essay where he's like,

26:23.040 --> 26:26.400
fuck James Fenimore Cooper, he sucks ass.

26:26.400 --> 26:29.920
And that to me is like, cool, I don't have to read that.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.080
Mark Twain says he sucks.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.680
Here's a quote from that.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.920
In one place in Deerslayer and in the restricted space

26:37.920 --> 26:41.600
of two thirds of a page, Cooper has scored 114 offenses

26:41.600 --> 26:44.960
against literary art out of a possible 115.

26:44.960 --> 26:46.400
It breaks the record.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.240
He fucking dunks on the whole time.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.480
That's so fresh, right?

26:50.480 --> 26:52.720
So now I don't have to read James Fenimore Cooper.

26:52.720 --> 26:54.880
But the rabbit hole goes deeper

26:54.880 --> 26:57.520
because some people criticize that piece.

26:57.520 --> 27:01.840
There's a quote here, this is from John McWilliams.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.760
Hilarious though Twain's essay is,

27:03.760 --> 27:05.760
is valid only within its own narrow

27:05.760 --> 27:07.760
and sometimes misapplied criteria.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.560
Fucking great.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.160
Now I don't have to read Mark Twain.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.320
I'm out on him too.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.160
If you keep going down that chain,

27:14.160 --> 27:15.840
eventually all you're left with

27:15.840 --> 27:19.520
is the worlds of power novelizations of old NES games.

27:19.520 --> 27:20.320
Which is fine.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.920
Only the work of FX9 will survive.

27:23.920 --> 27:27.360
If you go deep enough, you will find like Mark,

27:28.240 --> 27:31.120
like Mark, Luke and John being like,

27:31.120 --> 27:34.560
those novelizations of Mario fucking rule, dudes.

27:35.760 --> 27:38.080
In the old gospels, it's man,

27:38.080 --> 27:40.720
the blaster master novelization of worlds of power

27:40.720 --> 27:42.160
is some real bullshit.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.760
They left out a lot of really cool levels and power ups.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.280
That seems like a pretty good place

27:47.280 --> 27:48.560
to head on over to the money zone.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.960
But first Trav, why don't you tell us a little bit

27:50.960 --> 27:52.080
about this week's organization

27:52.080 --> 27:54.000
that we're donating our ad revenue to.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.120
Yeah, we're gonna be donating

27:55.120 --> 27:57.520
to the Sylvia Rivera Law Project.

27:57.520 --> 28:02.960
Sylvia Rivera was partners in work with Marsha P. Johnson.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.800
Did a lot of work for the trans community

28:05.440 --> 28:07.840
and the Sylvia Rivera Law Project.

28:07.840 --> 28:10.720
Basically, they're working hard to provide legal services

28:11.280 --> 28:14.560
and protect the rights of trans people.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.840
They focus specifically on people of color and poor people

28:17.840 --> 28:21.120
and fighting discrimination against gender non-conforming folks.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.640
So it's a great organization.

28:22.640 --> 28:26.000
You can check them out at srlp.org.

28:26.000 --> 28:40.240
Let's get the money to give to them now.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.240
I can tell you about an experience

28:42.240 --> 28:44.400
I had this very weekend.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.920
God, I hope it's related to Stitch Fix

28:45.920 --> 28:47.280
because that's who we're supposed to be telling.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.400
It is, it is, don't worry.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.720
I got me a Stitch Fix.

28:50.720 --> 28:53.760
I opened up their box and I lifted out a shirt

28:53.760 --> 28:57.440
that made me gasp in delight

28:57.440 --> 29:00.640
and run across the house to find my wife and say,

29:00.640 --> 29:03.920
look at this absolute winner I have just received.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.280
I will post a picture of it.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.640
It is a beautiful shirt.

29:06.640 --> 29:07.760
And here's the best thing.

29:07.760 --> 29:09.120
Covered in anime babes.

29:09.840 --> 29:12.240
No, there are no anime babes, Griffin.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.320
It kind of looks like fireworks on it,

29:14.320 --> 29:16.800
but in a really cool way.

29:16.800 --> 29:19.840
And the thing is, I didn't pick that shirt out.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.080
It was because my stylist has worked with me

29:22.080 --> 29:23.120
and I've answered questions

29:23.120 --> 29:24.240
that they were able to say like,

29:24.240 --> 29:26.240
Travis is gonna love this.

29:26.240 --> 29:27.520
And they were right.

29:27.520 --> 29:29.040
Because that's what Stitch Fix does.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.040
They ask you questions,

29:31.040 --> 29:33.680
they work with you to figure out what your style is.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.840
And then they send things that are your size,

29:36.400 --> 29:38.480
your style, and you try them on,

29:38.480 --> 29:39.840
you keep what you love,

29:39.840 --> 29:41.680
and you only pay for what you keep.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.520
And one of my favorite things about it,

29:43.520 --> 29:44.480
you can say like,

29:44.480 --> 29:46.160
this is how much money I'm comfortable

29:46.160 --> 29:47.360
paying for a t-shirt.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.880
This is how much money I'm comfortable

29:48.880 --> 29:50.400
paying for shorts, right?

29:50.400 --> 29:52.640
And so they won't send you super expensive clothes

29:52.640 --> 29:53.920
that you don't wanna keep.

29:53.920 --> 29:54.720
It's amazing.

29:54.720 --> 29:55.760

30:33.920 --> 30:34.640
Whoa.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.800
Hot honey butter glazed chicken.

30:37.920 --> 30:38.240
Whoa.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.840
Fettuccini.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.280
Okay.

30:41.280 --> 30:42.240
Meatballs.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.280
And you're hearing me say this,

30:43.280 --> 30:43.760
you're thinking like,

30:43.760 --> 30:44.800
what is he talking about, a restaurant?

30:44.800 --> 30:46.560
You shouldn't be going out to one of those,

30:47.440 --> 30:48.640
a place that is dangerous

30:48.640 --> 30:50.960
and you could possibly get COVID from

30:50.960 --> 30:51.920
if they're doing it bad.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.160
Well, no, you goofball.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.640
I'm talking about doing it at home with Blue Apron,

30:56.640 --> 30:58.160
where it's safe in your house

30:58.160 --> 31:00.000
and you can make fettuccini pasta and mushrooms

31:00.000 --> 31:03.520
like you're doing food art.

31:03.520 --> 31:06.800
And right now cooking at home matters more than ever.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.160
I think I've outlined that pretty well,

31:08.160 --> 31:09.680
so I don't have to go into more detail

31:09.680 --> 31:11.840
about why home cooking matters right now.

31:11.840 --> 31:13.840
But Blue Apron is a really good way to do that

31:13.840 --> 31:15.600
because you get a box of fresh quality ingredients

31:15.600 --> 31:16.880
delivered straight to your door

31:16.880 --> 31:18.240
and then you follow these recipes

31:18.240 --> 31:20.720
and you make tasty, tasty meals

31:20.720 --> 31:22.560
and you learn how to cook.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.160
I did Blue Apron for a long time

31:24.160 --> 31:26.400
and got good at learning how to cook

31:26.400 --> 31:27.600
and I can make whatever.

31:27.600 --> 31:32.720
Stew, pasta, bread, pudding.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.400
And it's great.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.000
You create a plan that works for you

31:36.000 --> 31:38.640
with Blue Apron's ever-changing mix of menu options

31:38.640 --> 31:42.800
and prices start as low as $7.49 per serving.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.160
Don't sacrifice flavor.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.360
Don't settle for boring meals.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.840

31:51.840 --> 31:54.400

31:54.400 --> 31:57.200
That's BlueApron.com slash my brother, Blue Apron.

31:57.840 --> 32:00.000
Feed your soul.

32:00.000 --> 32:00.500
Whoa.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.160
I started listening to Oh No Ross and Carrie

32:04.160 --> 32:05.680
shortly after I broke my arm

32:05.680 --> 32:08.240
and the doctor had told me I'd never walk again.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.840
I couldn't get my book started.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.600
I was lost, honestly.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.760
I knew it was time to make a change.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.480
There's something about Oh No Ross and Carrie

32:16.480 --> 32:18.800
that you just can't get anywhere else.

32:18.800 --> 32:22.320
They're thought leaders, discoverers, founders.

32:22.320 --> 32:23.680
I'd call them heroes.

32:23.680 --> 32:26.080
Ross and Carrie don't just report on French science,

32:26.080 --> 32:28.160
spirituality, and claims of the paranormal.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.520
They take part themselves.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.000
They show up so you don't have to.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.080
But you might find that you want to.

32:35.360 --> 32:36.720
My arm is better.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.000
I can walk again.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.480
I wrote an entire book this weekend.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.800
It's terrible, but I did it.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.720
Just go to MaximumFun.org.

32:44.720 --> 32:47.600
Thank you, Ross and Carrie.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.120
Oh No Ross and Carrie is just a podcast.

32:49.120 --> 32:49.920
It doesn't do anything.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.280
It's just sound you listen to in your ears.

32:51.280 --> 32:52.160
All these people are made up.

32:52.160 --> 32:52.800
Goodbye.

32:52.800 --> 32:53.760
Hey, who's that on the-

32:54.480 --> 32:54.960
Who is it?

32:54.960 --> 32:55.680
It's Lynn.

32:55.680 --> 32:56.240
Hi, Lynn.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.920
I wasn't recording before, but now I am.

32:57.920 --> 32:58.400
Hi, Lynn.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.040
Hi, Lynn.

32:59.040 --> 32:59.520
Hi.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.720
Welcome to the podcast.

33:00.720 --> 33:02.000
We were in the middle of doing the podcast

33:02.000 --> 33:02.880
and now we're just like-

33:02.880 --> 33:03.440
Thank you.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.160
In it.

33:04.160 --> 33:04.800
You're on it.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.000
This is the podcast.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.520
Longtime fan, third time caller.

33:07.520 --> 33:08.160
Thrilled to be here.

33:08.160 --> 33:08.640
Is that right?

33:08.640 --> 33:09.280
There's no way.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.480
I feel like you were just on the one time

33:10.480 --> 33:12.240
when you were at the public.

33:12.240 --> 33:17.120
And then that time you guys did the Margaritaville Blue Carp.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.960
And then the other times were live times

33:20.960 --> 33:23.600
when you indulged me saying,

33:23.600 --> 33:25.760
hey guys, I wrote another song about you.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.200
Can I play it at your show?

33:27.200 --> 33:29.520
We've given you a lot of opportunities, huh?

33:29.520 --> 33:30.160
Yeah.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.600
You're so welcome.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.040
I think this is my third time on the podcast.

33:33.040 --> 33:33.600
That's great.

33:33.600 --> 33:33.840
Wow.

33:33.840 --> 33:34.560
What an honor.

33:34.560 --> 33:35.760
Make them say Hammer proper.

33:37.440 --> 33:38.960
How are you doing though?

33:38.960 --> 33:40.080
I'm all right.

33:40.080 --> 33:40.400
Whoa.

33:40.400 --> 33:41.680
Oh, fuck.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.280
There's a story behind there.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.160
There's a sadness.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.400
Sadness behind those eyes.

33:49.360 --> 33:53.120
Actually, I'm quite hashtag blessed all things considered.

33:53.120 --> 33:56.000
You're catching me after spending an hour and a half

33:56.000 --> 33:59.440
putting together a play set involving tools.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.800
And as soon as I finished putting together the play set,

34:02.800 --> 34:05.680
my son yelled, yay, and then stubbed his toe,

34:05.680 --> 34:07.520
started bleeding, and started screaming.

34:07.520 --> 34:09.760
Oh my god, did he stub it on the play set?

34:10.320 --> 34:10.800
No, no.

34:10.800 --> 34:16.000
He stubbed it on being five and running funny.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.040
So I don't really want to talk about Hamilton.

34:19.040 --> 34:22.880
It is, if anybody cares, it's coming out Disney plus July 3rd.

34:22.880 --> 34:23.760
You can watch it on Disney.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.680
I'm sure you're fucking sick of talking about it.

34:25.680 --> 34:26.720
Sick of talking about it.

34:26.720 --> 34:27.680
I'm sick of talking about it.

34:27.680 --> 34:29.600
I'm happy to talk to you about anything else.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.560
Any other musical.

34:31.280 --> 34:32.560
Any other musical.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.160
What's going on with Tootsie?

34:34.160 --> 34:37.200
I have this feeling sometimes like Tootsie is still going.

34:37.200 --> 34:40.000
Yeah, like they're still doing it to no crowd.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.960
Yeah, I feel like they're still doing Tootsie probably.

34:43.760 --> 34:44.640
It's come and gone.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.520
Oh man, it was so funny though.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.280
Poor little Henny out for Tootsie.

34:49.280 --> 34:52.000
Are any musicals going right now?

34:53.040 --> 34:57.840
There is a Phantom of the Opera playing in Seoul, South Korea.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.320
That is the one musical playing in the world right now

35:00.320 --> 35:05.840
because they were serious about their shit and locked it down.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.520
And now they can do Phantom,

35:08.320 --> 35:11.440
which is all about a guy in a mask, weirdly enough.

35:11.440 --> 35:12.800
Yeah, it is weird.

35:12.800 --> 35:15.280
That's the price you get for taking it seriously.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.880
You get to see Phantom.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.800
I was going to ask about the musicals

35:18.800 --> 35:21.280
that form the DNA of who you are.

35:21.280 --> 35:24.880
I'm so grateful every time we get a little night music,

35:24.880 --> 35:26.320
courtesy of Justin McElroy,

35:26.320 --> 35:28.080
when he sings in that ineffable-

35:28.080 --> 35:31.040
It's really just that one track though, right, Juice?

35:31.040 --> 35:33.760
You're not like a big night music like hit.

35:33.760 --> 35:37.120
Didn't know it was from that.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.200
So that's where I'm at as far as that.

35:40.400 --> 35:43.280
I got had on a Lou Rawls CD when I was younger

35:43.280 --> 35:45.360
and so it got in my heart that way.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.920
Musicals that really fought-

35:47.920 --> 35:52.560
Man, you know, obviously Rent was huge for me

35:52.560 --> 35:55.760
as Tim Robbins told me at your show, Hamilton.

35:56.640 --> 36:00.160
Rent taught my generation tolerance, which is huge.

36:00.160 --> 36:01.200
Huge for Rent.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.000
Thank you to Rent.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.280
Big ups to Rent.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.280
Did you ever dream cast yourself in Rent?

36:05.280 --> 36:06.960
Did you ever give a thought who you might play?

36:06.960 --> 36:10.560
I'm pretty sure that I would be the window washing guy.

36:10.560 --> 36:13.120
Honest living, honest living.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.240
That would be a good part.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.320
Honestly, I would be, and I would be lucky to have it.

36:17.600 --> 36:22.480
You know, Man of La Mancha was a big one for me.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.320
That's a cornerstone for me.

36:24.320 --> 36:28.480
That was my audition song was Man of La Mancha

36:28.480 --> 36:30.000
for a very long time was my-

36:30.000 --> 36:31.840
The title track, Man of La Mancha?

36:31.840 --> 36:33.120
Oh yeah, not Impossible Dream.

36:33.120 --> 36:34.240
I can't carry that off.

36:34.240 --> 36:38.000
But I could do like a sort of spoken word intro

36:38.000 --> 36:39.280
into the song and then,

36:40.320 --> 36:42.080
because that gets you like 30 seconds in,

36:42.080 --> 36:43.840
then there's only 30 seconds of singing after that,

36:43.840 --> 36:44.720
which is perfect, right?

36:44.720 --> 36:48.320
I, Lynn and I share this playing Birdie,

36:49.040 --> 36:50.560
Conrad Birdie in Bye Bye Birdie.

36:51.680 --> 36:53.760
It is, how old were you when you did it?

36:54.320 --> 36:57.040
I was, I want to say like 17, 18.

36:57.040 --> 36:57.840
That's huge.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.640
When you are at your gangliest and teeniest

37:00.640 --> 37:03.520
and you play a role in which everyone has to pretend

37:03.520 --> 37:04.320
to be in love with you,

37:04.320 --> 37:06.080
I mean, it kind of explains everything about-

37:06.080 --> 37:08.000
Well, it goes one step further than that, Lynn.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.600
Our father was the director, Nepotism,

37:11.600 --> 37:15.760
and one of the creative decisions he made

37:15.760 --> 37:18.080
was to have Conrad Birdie, myself,

37:18.080 --> 37:24.000
enter from behind a 12 foot tall photograph of myself,

37:24.000 --> 37:30.000
a backlit with like fog while everyone cheered for me.

37:31.120 --> 37:34.000
Your reckless confidence is entirely justified.

37:34.000 --> 37:34.240
Yeah.

37:34.240 --> 37:35.760
Yeah, it's not his fault.

37:35.760 --> 37:36.240
Can't blame him.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.600
It's all dad's fault.

37:37.600 --> 37:38.640
Griffin, you like musicals?

37:38.640 --> 37:40.960
Yo, King Kong.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.200
The King Kong musical.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.800
Seen it, I saw it.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.240
Yeah, love that big guy.

37:49.280 --> 37:52.560
As of last year, I'm officially a Tony voter

37:52.560 --> 37:54.560
and so I did my due diligence

37:54.560 --> 37:56.640
and I saw every show of last season.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.800
I thought you were gonna say voted for King Kong.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.160
I did see the King Kong.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.000
Voted, biggest gorilla, yes.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.240
It won a special award.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.040
There are-

38:05.040 --> 38:05.920
A King Kong award.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.200
Yeah, biggest King Kong.

38:07.200 --> 38:10.160
It won a special honorary Tony for being the biggest King Kong

38:10.160 --> 38:13.120
for taking 14 people to manipulate.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.880
It has a special Kong, Tony.

38:14.880 --> 38:18.000
It knocked the shit right out of Noises Off's King Kong.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.440
That King Kong sucked.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.640
That King Kong sucked.

38:22.640 --> 38:23.920
The one in Tootsie was cool though

38:23.920 --> 38:26.480
because he had sunglasses and he came out on a skateboard.

38:26.480 --> 38:27.360
He was like, oh man.

38:27.360 --> 38:28.720
But only 13 people.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.240
Yeah.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.800
Hey, Lynn, are there musicals that you are...

38:33.360 --> 38:34.880
I get this with pop culture sometimes

38:34.880 --> 38:37.440
where I become fixated or obsessed

38:37.440 --> 38:40.320
with the idea of something without actually

38:40.960 --> 38:42.480
having any actual affection for it

38:42.480 --> 38:44.240
or actually maybe even seeing it.

38:44.240 --> 38:47.040
I'll give you an example to give you a little time to think.

38:47.040 --> 38:51.440
There is this musical called Chocolate the Musical

38:51.440 --> 38:56.080
and it's a one-woman show that this woman tours around with

38:56.080 --> 38:58.320
and does Chocolate the Musical for like,

38:58.320 --> 39:00.800
I guess if you have like a meeting of the Red Hat Ladies

39:00.800 --> 39:01.760
or something like that,

39:01.760 --> 39:04.800
she'll come and do musical, Chocolate the Musical.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.360
The Red Hat Ladies is such a deep pull, Dustin.

39:09.360 --> 39:10.560
Not if you know Arnani, man.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.480
It's pretty much top of mind 24-7.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.520
Is she a Red Hatter?

39:13.520 --> 39:14.160
Hell yeah, dude.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.440
Absolutely.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.240
The Red Hat Ladies, in case you don't got this,

39:18.240 --> 39:20.640
is like a society of ladies who wear

39:21.280 --> 39:24.640
like red Sunday brunch hats and go see shows.

39:24.640 --> 39:25.840
It's very benign.

39:25.840 --> 39:27.440
It's not the current connotation of Red Hat.

39:27.440 --> 39:29.200
No, it's a very different vibe.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.120
The other one is the High Fidelity Musical

39:31.680 --> 39:33.440
which came out for like a few weeks

39:33.440 --> 39:35.040
and then wasn't anymore.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.560
Eight performances on Broadway

39:36.560 --> 39:38.480
written by my good friend, Tom Kitt.

39:38.480 --> 39:40.720
That was the musical that put the fear of God in me

39:40.720 --> 39:44.320
because the same producers produced High Fidelity

39:44.320 --> 39:47.120
that produced In the Heights, my first show.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.360
And like for years, they were like,

39:49.360 --> 39:51.120
what are we going to get High Fidelity on?

39:51.120 --> 39:52.960
Because that's a no brainer hit.

39:53.920 --> 39:54.880
Everyone loves the book.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.440
Everyone loves the like tunes.

39:58.480 --> 40:02.640
And then it like lasted eight performances.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.320
And they were basically like,

40:04.320 --> 40:05.280
once High Fidelity is a hit,

40:05.280 --> 40:07.760
we'll take a chance on your little show with Latins in it.

40:07.760 --> 40:12.800
And then it didn't, nothing happened.

40:12.800 --> 40:13.600
How did your show do?

40:13.600 --> 40:18.000
It turns out our show did okay.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.360
But it was scary.

40:19.360 --> 40:21.520
It was sort of like that was such a surefire hit.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.240
It had a well-known director, a great composer.

40:25.040 --> 40:29.200
And it just, you know, no one wants to see Rob sing.

40:30.240 --> 40:30.960
I guess, yeah.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.760
Like the whole thing is that he listens to music.

40:33.760 --> 40:36.560
You're making something about the best music ever

40:36.560 --> 40:38.400
when there's frequent arguments about-

40:38.400 --> 40:40.160
And you're not allowed to use that music.

40:40.160 --> 40:40.960
Totally.

40:40.960 --> 40:44.240
It was an impossible task.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.080
You want to hear my favorite song?

40:46.080 --> 40:48.240
I own a record store.

40:50.160 --> 40:51.280
That's my favorite song.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.480
It's always been my favorite song.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.800
We don't have questions,

40:54.800 --> 40:56.000
a question from the audience for you.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.480
Like we sometimes do for guestpert stuff.

40:58.480 --> 41:00.400
And I've been asking the last few guestperts,

41:00.400 --> 41:03.680
like, you know, COVID related stuff.

41:03.680 --> 41:06.000
Like how are you, how, what are you doing at home?

41:06.000 --> 41:09.440
But I think it would be better to do just a Yahoo.

41:09.440 --> 41:10.240
Yeah.

41:10.240 --> 41:13.040
And just like get you on that Yahoo with us.

41:13.040 --> 41:16.800
Do you feel like qualified to do one of those?

41:17.840 --> 41:20.480
Completely unqualified, but happy to be along for the ride.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.200
Wait, okay.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.880
Just one more quick thing.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.160
Just Starlight Express.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.320
Have you seen it, Lynn?

41:26.320 --> 41:26.560
Can I tell you?

41:26.560 --> 41:28.320
Because that's a musical about trains.

41:28.320 --> 41:28.880
Yeah, I know.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.480
And I fucking would love to see that shit.

41:30.480 --> 41:33.760
By the way, it's based on Thomas the Tank Engine.

41:33.760 --> 41:34.320
Get out.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.960
His company is the really useful company

41:36.960 --> 41:39.760
because he wanted the rights to Thomas

41:39.760 --> 41:40.880
and it didn't quite happen.

41:40.880 --> 41:43.680
So he did his own train musical.

41:43.680 --> 41:44.800
I've never seen it.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.280
I actually have the ability on that one.

41:47.280 --> 41:50.000
I remember seeing the commercials and being like,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.400
well, trains, musicals, where do I sign?

41:52.400 --> 41:55.360
But my parents didn't have the money, so I never saw it.

41:55.360 --> 41:56.640
Unfair, unfair.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.520
Okay, Griffin, I'm sorry.

41:57.520 --> 42:00.080
I won't talk about any other bizarre musicals.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.480
Lynn, I'm so excited for you to put your,

42:02.480 --> 42:05.440
we've never allowed anyone into this particular sanctum.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.360
And I think you're going to crush it.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.160
Michelle sent this one.

42:08.160 --> 42:11.840
It's a Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call

42:11.840 --> 42:14.480
Jamuel Miranda asks,

42:16.320 --> 42:18.720
Super Mario versus yourself in a few scenarios.

42:19.600 --> 42:20.640
For some random reason,

42:20.640 --> 42:22.480
Super Mario is teleported into the real world

42:22.480 --> 42:25.040
with the sole goal to hunt you down and kill you.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.440
Mario is still bound to his game physics

42:27.440 --> 42:28.560
and can still jump just as high.

42:28.560 --> 42:29.840
I'll give you three scenarios that could occur

42:29.840 --> 42:31.440
and I want you to tell me how they would play out.

42:31.440 --> 42:34.400
Oh boy. So we can just run down these.

42:36.480 --> 42:39.040
That went such a different direction than I-

42:39.040 --> 42:40.800
Yeah, before we get too deep,

42:40.800 --> 42:42.480
I need to make sure I understand the premise.

42:42.480 --> 42:43.200
Yeah.

42:43.200 --> 42:45.200
Mario has been teleported

42:47.280 --> 42:49.680
into our world Sonic movie style.

42:49.680 --> 42:51.600
Earth 616 or wherever.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.600
Go down a pipe, come up a earth toilet,

42:53.600 --> 42:55.440
and he wants to kill you so bad.

42:55.440 --> 42:55.840
And that's-

42:55.840 --> 42:57.680
Okay, so he wants to kill you

42:57.680 --> 42:59.440
or he's been tasked with killing you.

42:59.440 --> 43:01.200
He needs to kill you.

43:01.200 --> 43:02.640
Okay, that is important

43:02.640 --> 43:04.160
because I could maybe talk him out of it

43:04.160 --> 43:05.600
if it's just a job.

43:05.600 --> 43:07.680
No, you got the pipe inside you that gets him home.

43:07.680 --> 43:08.320
So anyway-

43:10.320 --> 43:12.560
Now even that though is a different scenario

43:12.560 --> 43:14.400
than him just wanting to kill me.

43:14.400 --> 43:15.680
Okay, he could jump really high.

43:15.680 --> 43:17.520
Scenario one, you are casually walking outside

43:17.520 --> 43:18.320
like any normal day.

43:18.320 --> 43:20.080
You feel safe and are unarmed.

43:20.080 --> 43:23.040
Suddenly Mario, who is also unarmed,

43:23.040 --> 43:25.120
comes running at you with the purpose to end your life.

43:25.120 --> 43:27.440
You know this and prepare to fend off the ambush.

43:27.440 --> 43:27.920
What happens?

43:27.920 --> 43:30.560
Wait, is he mushroomed or not?

43:31.360 --> 43:32.080
He's unarmed.

43:32.080 --> 43:33.200
This is actually huge.

43:33.200 --> 43:35.040
I need to know scale, right?

43:35.040 --> 43:36.800
That is my biggest question.

43:36.800 --> 43:38.960
On the TV, he doesn't look very big.

43:38.960 --> 43:40.640
Is he a human-sized Mario?

43:40.640 --> 43:41.600
Is he a human-sized?

43:41.600 --> 43:43.200
Okay, so he's a human-sized Mario.

43:43.200 --> 43:45.200
Is he human-sized at the same proportions?

43:45.760 --> 43:47.360
Because density there is a huge factor.

43:47.360 --> 43:48.080
He's a dense fella.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.800
He's quite thick in all the right places,

43:52.800 --> 43:54.400
but he's running at you.

43:54.400 --> 43:56.240
It says he's running at you.

43:56.240 --> 43:57.920
He's not like walking at you slow,

43:57.920 --> 43:59.280
imposing, Terminator-style.

43:59.280 --> 44:03.040
This fucking plumber is sprinting at you, Lynn.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.160
You have to get high.

44:04.160 --> 44:04.880
You gotta get high.

44:04.880 --> 44:05.680
You have to get high.

44:05.680 --> 44:06.640
Higher than-

44:06.640 --> 44:08.080
If his whole thing is jumping on you,

44:08.080 --> 44:09.040
you gotta get high.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.480
Yeah, you gotta get to the high ground.

44:10.480 --> 44:12.720
But now we're in a Donkey Kong scenario.

44:12.720 --> 44:13.280
Yeah.

44:13.280 --> 44:13.760
Yeah.

44:13.760 --> 44:15.120
He's not gonna stop.

44:15.120 --> 44:15.680
He's coming.

44:15.680 --> 44:16.720
You gotta throw barrels.

44:16.720 --> 44:18.000
You gotta throw barrels.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Gotta throw some barrels at this fucking guy.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.760
Could you get under something,

44:22.960 --> 44:25.440
under something that will protect you?

44:25.440 --> 44:27.840
That will protect your head from bouncing.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.560
Because if it's just Mario running at you,

44:30.560 --> 44:31.440
he does not have a-

44:32.080 --> 44:34.000
I mean, I guess he could spin, couldn't he?

44:34.000 --> 44:35.520
That's the danger.

44:35.520 --> 44:36.240
Here's my thing.

44:36.800 --> 44:39.040
There are enemies in Mario that walk slowly at you

44:39.040 --> 44:41.200
and you wait for them to end you,

44:41.200 --> 44:43.840
or sometimes they run really fast at you,

44:43.840 --> 44:44.800
or sometimes they jump.

44:44.800 --> 44:46.720
I don't think there is an enemy in Mario

44:46.720 --> 44:49.440
that can fucking punch and kick the way I do.

44:49.440 --> 44:50.880
So Mario may not-

44:50.880 --> 44:52.720
He may run at me and start to jump

44:52.720 --> 44:54.000
and I just kind of move out of the way

44:54.000 --> 44:55.440
and I fucking punch him in the face.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.120
He's like, oh, what are these?

44:57.120 --> 44:58.720
And I'm like, yeah, you motherfucker.

44:58.720 --> 44:59.360
I punch back.

44:59.360 --> 45:00.320
He won't understand it.

45:00.320 --> 45:00.880
He won't get it.

45:00.880 --> 45:02.960
No, he can't process that.

45:02.960 --> 45:05.840
There is also, I'm now thinking that the Mario games

45:05.840 --> 45:06.880
would be much different

45:06.880 --> 45:09.360
if like when a Koopa saw Mario coming,

45:09.360 --> 45:11.280
they ran away from him.

45:11.280 --> 45:13.840
Like, I don't want, I'm just walking around, dude.

45:13.840 --> 45:14.320
Yeah.

45:14.880 --> 45:15.200
All right.

45:15.200 --> 45:16.640
I'm a hopping turtle.

45:16.640 --> 45:19.440
Let's do a bit of, let's do some opposition research here.

45:19.440 --> 45:21.120
Lynn, you're gonna play the role of Lynn.

45:21.120 --> 45:24.000
You are quarantining wherever you are quarantining.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.240
Travis, Justin, and I are gonna be Mario.

45:26.240 --> 45:27.600
And let me pitch you scenario two.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.040
You're inside your house

45:29.040 --> 45:30.960
like any normal person during quarantine

45:30.960 --> 45:33.200
and you see Mario trying to break into your house.

45:33.200 --> 45:35.200
You can defend yourself with anything in your home

45:35.200 --> 45:37.360
and Mario is armed with a hammer throw power up.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.440
Wait, a hammer throw power up?

45:39.440 --> 45:41.680
That's like Donkey Kong.

45:41.680 --> 45:43.680
He's got the hammer and he's swinging indiscriminately?

45:43.680 --> 45:44.240
No, he throw.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.120
Like the Hammer Bros?

45:45.680 --> 45:47.440
Yeah, he can throw.

45:47.440 --> 45:49.600
So I guess take a moment, look around your house

45:49.600 --> 45:51.440
and in 15 seconds, Justin, Travis, and I

45:51.440 --> 45:53.040
are gonna come at you with a hammer throw power up.

45:53.040 --> 45:55.120
And don't say a Tony or anything

45:55.120 --> 45:56.960
because like that's cheating.

45:56.960 --> 45:58.000
Because it's very heavy.

45:58.000 --> 45:58.880
The Tony is a heavy weapon.

45:58.880 --> 46:00.160
Very heavy and impressive.

46:01.040 --> 46:03.360
What if Lynn is like, I pick up the big gun.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.920
By the way, guys, I'm huge into guns

46:05.920 --> 46:09.920
and this is how I'm announcing it to the world.

46:11.120 --> 46:11.360
Yeah.

46:11.360 --> 46:12.640
All right, Lynn, your time's up.

46:12.640 --> 46:13.840
I smash in through the window

46:13.840 --> 46:16.800
with my big powerful carpenter's boots or plumber's boots

46:16.800 --> 46:17.760
and now Mario's in your house.

46:17.760 --> 46:22.240
I activate the Playmobil water table

46:22.240 --> 46:24.640
I have spent the last fucking hour assembling.

46:24.640 --> 46:26.560
You're so much slower in water.

46:26.560 --> 46:27.040
Get at me.

46:27.040 --> 46:28.080
Okay, okay.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.120
So you've, okay.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.320
You're so much slower in water.

46:30.320 --> 46:32.960
Now I'm just a squid who moves slowly and I'm a threat.

46:32.960 --> 46:33.200
Okay.

46:34.080 --> 46:35.360
Oh, that's pretty good.

46:35.360 --> 46:38.240
I don't know how a water table would flood an entire house.

46:38.240 --> 46:38.800
You shouldn't.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.080
I'm putting on all the water.

46:40.080 --> 46:40.800
Just all the water.

46:40.800 --> 46:42.000
I'm just, I'm flooding everything.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.600
Okay, Lynn floods the house.

46:43.600 --> 46:45.280
Justin, Travis, take the Mario wheel.

46:45.280 --> 46:46.560
We're just still trying to kill Lynn.

46:46.560 --> 46:47.120
Is that the idea?

46:47.120 --> 46:48.960
Yeah, the three of us are trying to kill our friend, Lynn.

46:48.960 --> 46:50.160
Are we three different Marios?

46:50.160 --> 46:51.120
No, we're the same Mario.

46:51.120 --> 46:52.080
I'm gonna take over.

46:52.080 --> 46:52.880
Travis, Travis, you can be Mario now.

46:52.880 --> 46:54.400
I'm turning this to a water level.

46:54.400 --> 46:55.440
Get on my level.

46:55.440 --> 46:58.480
Okay, so you've begun flooding your own home.

46:58.480 --> 47:00.080
Yeah, the hammer throwing is no longer,

47:00.080 --> 47:01.040
you can't do that in water.

47:01.040 --> 47:01.520
That's silly.

47:01.520 --> 47:04.320
Yeah, so I'm gonna break a wall sconce.

47:04.320 --> 47:07.200
I assume you have sconces off the wall

47:07.200 --> 47:08.240
and attempt to electric.

47:08.240 --> 47:09.840
Don't fucking dox Lynn.

47:09.840 --> 47:12.320
I live in an apartment building in Manhattan.

47:13.120 --> 47:14.080
So you have sconces?

47:15.040 --> 47:16.000
I have no sconces.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.320
Ah, fuck, that was the only thing I had.

47:18.320 --> 47:21.040
Well, now you just see Mario looking for sconces

47:21.040 --> 47:22.400
and he's just pawing at the wall.

47:22.400 --> 47:23.520
Travis, waste his turn.

47:24.560 --> 47:27.440
Lynn, how are you gonna kill Shigeru Miyamoto's best friend

47:27.440 --> 47:29.360
and video game son, Mario?

47:31.760 --> 47:35.040
I am going to, because I know that just touching me

47:35.040 --> 47:37.840
will kill him, because that's how it works in this world.

47:37.840 --> 47:42.320
I'm going to edge and swim until Mario's close to the window

47:42.320 --> 47:43.920
and then I'm gonna try to open the window.

47:43.920 --> 47:45.360
Okay, Justin.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.480
Because I live several stories up.

47:46.480 --> 47:48.480
He's right in your fucking trap, Justin, get him.

47:49.680 --> 47:52.800
I'm gonna push beloved Tony winner

47:52.800 --> 47:55.520
and multi-talented artist, Lin Manuel Miranda,

47:55.520 --> 47:56.320
out the window.

47:56.320 --> 47:56.820
Okay.

47:57.520 --> 48:00.720
I'm gonna Wario scowl as I fall out the window.

48:00.720 --> 48:01.600
All right, we won.

48:02.320 --> 48:03.040
We killed Lin.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.480
What is scenario three?

48:06.480 --> 48:07.200
Let me just read it.

48:07.200 --> 48:08.960
Hey, who lives, who dies, who tells your story?

48:08.960 --> 48:13.200
It turns out Mario is who tells your story.

48:13.200 --> 48:15.040
That's so weird, you didn't see that coming.

48:15.040 --> 48:17.920
Sorry, but our princess is in another fucking castle.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.280
Lin, I know you're busy and we've kept you

48:19.280 --> 48:20.480
for a long time, but I would be remiss

48:20.480 --> 48:22.240
if I didn't read scenario three.

48:22.240 --> 48:24.640
You've successfully evaded Mario this whole time

48:24.640 --> 48:26.320
and managed to locate where he lives

48:26.320 --> 48:28.240
while he isn't trying to kill you.

48:28.240 --> 48:30.400
You now have the element of surprise.

48:30.400 --> 48:31.920
You now have the element of surprise

48:31.920 --> 48:34.080
and can bring with you whatever you could reasonably

48:34.080 --> 48:35.440
afford, get a hold of, or make.

48:35.440 --> 48:37.920
There is no way of knowing what Mario has though.

48:37.920 --> 48:39.920
So now the tables have flipped a little bit.

48:41.040 --> 48:44.320
Mario Lin is in his Manhattan apartment.

48:44.320 --> 48:48.000
Well, this is getting a little aggro for my tastes.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.080
Yeah, this is like John Wick shit where it's like,

48:50.080 --> 48:51.920
okay, now you have to go after them.

48:52.640 --> 48:54.480
This is that Van Damme hard target.

48:54.480 --> 48:56.160
How does it feel to be hunted?

48:57.840 --> 49:00.800
I assume he's like little.

49:00.800 --> 49:02.720
He's not eating a mushroom when he's chilling at home.

49:02.720 --> 49:03.120
Oh no.

49:03.120 --> 49:05.280
He's on the run now, if he's hiding out.

49:05.280 --> 49:07.040
We don't talk about this, but when he eats the mushroom

49:07.040 --> 49:10.720
and gets big, it hurts his bones so fucking bad.

49:10.720 --> 49:15.200
His bones and muscles and skins all grow so fast, so much.

49:15.200 --> 49:18.240
And when he gets small again, his bones don't shrink.

49:18.240 --> 49:19.680
They just kind of bend.

49:19.680 --> 49:22.480
It hurts so fucking bad.

49:22.480 --> 49:26.000
He doesn't eat the mushroom at home unless the princess

49:26.000 --> 49:27.760
makes him, if you know what I mean.

49:27.760 --> 49:28.640
I don't understand.

49:32.320 --> 49:32.880
For his hog.

49:34.720 --> 49:35.360
For Mario's hog.

49:35.360 --> 49:37.200
Oh, he eats it too.

49:37.200 --> 49:38.080
For his hog.

49:38.080 --> 49:38.400
Okay.

49:38.400 --> 49:40.880
For his hog.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.720
The mushroom makes his hog bigger.

49:43.520 --> 49:43.760
Right.

49:46.160 --> 49:50.240
Lynn, we're going to explain to you in excruciating detail

49:50.240 --> 49:52.080
the premise of Justin's joke.

49:52.080 --> 49:55.040
What Justin's saying is that when Mario eats a mushroom,

49:55.040 --> 49:59.680
his penis not only becomes engorged, but it begins.

49:59.680 --> 50:00.000
Right.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
All of them becomes bigger, Lynn, right?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.880
And so that would include his genitals, which,

50:04.880 --> 50:07.600
and I guess in this scenario, the princess would want

50:07.600 --> 50:11.120
like a bigger zone down there.

50:11.680 --> 50:12.320
Yeah.

50:12.320 --> 50:12.720
Does that make sense?

50:12.720 --> 50:16.000
So it would make him eat the mushroom so that his penis

50:16.000 --> 50:17.280
would become larger.

50:17.280 --> 50:19.360
Explain it back to us, Lynn, just to make sure that

50:19.360 --> 50:20.720
we know that you understand it.

50:22.880 --> 50:26.880
So Mario is at home, but he's in his half-man form,

50:26.880 --> 50:29.040
his lowercase form.

50:29.040 --> 50:29.600
Right.

50:29.600 --> 50:31.600
Unless the princess asks him to eat the mushroom,

50:31.600 --> 50:32.320
in which case-

50:32.320 --> 50:34.240
Why would she want that?

50:34.240 --> 50:36.160
And explain it, because I need to know that you got it

50:36.160 --> 50:37.040
before we can move on.

50:37.040 --> 50:39.680
It would grow him to double the scale,

50:39.680 --> 50:41.360
including his genitals.

50:41.360 --> 50:41.840
Right, perhaps.

50:42.400 --> 50:44.800
And why would that be desired by her?

50:44.800 --> 50:45.920
Why would she want that?

50:45.920 --> 50:46.400
Yeah.

50:46.400 --> 50:47.280
I'm gonna hang up.

50:49.200 --> 50:50.000
I'm gonna hang up.

50:50.000 --> 50:50.640
Everybody gets it.

50:50.640 --> 50:50.880
Okay.

50:50.880 --> 50:51.200
This is great.

50:51.200 --> 50:53.760
No, I need to know that he understands the benefit.

50:53.760 --> 50:54.800
It's all good stuff.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.640
It's all good, fun stuff.

50:56.640 --> 50:58.000
July 3rd.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.440
Welcome to Warp Zone.

50:59.440 --> 51:00.560
July 3rd.

51:00.560 --> 51:01.440
Check it out.

51:01.440 --> 51:02.720
Disney Plus.

51:02.720 --> 51:03.200
Probably.

51:03.200 --> 51:05.200
Dude, that will feature Hamilton and the-

51:05.200 --> 51:05.840
No one tell Disney Plus about this episode.

51:05.840 --> 51:07.680
It feels funny.

51:07.680 --> 51:10.240
I don't like the plug after this.

51:10.240 --> 51:11.120
I don't like the plug.

51:11.760 --> 51:12.640
Disney Plus.

51:12.640 --> 51:14.400
You can be a double feature.

51:14.400 --> 51:17.280
Hamilton and the Journey of Nettigan.

51:17.280 --> 51:18.320
Fire it up.

51:18.320 --> 51:19.120
Call up Bob Iger.

51:19.120 --> 51:20.960
Say, I got a podcast for you, bud.

51:23.600 --> 51:24.400
Gonna love this one.

51:24.400 --> 51:26.320
Kill our chances of getting on there, actually.

51:26.320 --> 51:28.080
I'm starting to freak out about it.

51:28.080 --> 51:30.320
So would you stab him, or-

51:30.320 --> 51:32.080
I think Lin doesn't have time to kill him.

51:32.080 --> 51:33.200
What would I do with-

51:33.200 --> 51:36.400
I mean, getting close to him would kill him in that moment

51:36.400 --> 51:37.600
when he's most vulnerable.

51:37.600 --> 51:38.000
He's a weak man.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.520
But would you enjoy that as much?

51:39.520 --> 51:40.400
I mean, that's a thing.

51:40.400 --> 51:41.600
Are you saying that you're going to-

51:42.720 --> 51:45.280
I just wanna be clear, Lin.

51:45.280 --> 51:49.920
Are you telling me that you're going to kill Mario

51:49.920 --> 51:53.520
while he's in flagrante in the middle of sexual Congress?

51:53.520 --> 51:55.840
Is that when you're gonna wait for your moment?

51:55.840 --> 51:57.760
You fucking nasty dog.

51:57.760 --> 51:59.520
Come on the podcast, Justin said.

51:59.520 --> 52:01.680
We'll talk about musicals, Justin said.

52:01.680 --> 52:02.800
July 3rd.

52:02.800 --> 52:06.880
We talked, but we did the prerequisite musical conversation

52:06.880 --> 52:10.080
before we got the meat, the pearl of this oyster.

52:11.040 --> 52:14.400
In my defense, I did wanna talk about more weird musicals,

52:14.400 --> 52:15.840
but Griffin made me change.

52:15.840 --> 52:17.200
You heard that happen.

52:17.200 --> 52:17.840
You heard him.

52:18.480 --> 52:19.520
Just real quick, though.

52:19.520 --> 52:21.360
Did you see Spider-Man?

52:21.360 --> 52:21.920
I didn't.

52:21.920 --> 52:22.560
I never did.

52:23.360 --> 52:25.680
I had a friend who was at the first preview

52:26.400 --> 52:28.800
and he was a big Spider-Man fan and he was like,

52:28.800 --> 52:31.440
this isn't even about Spider-Man, dude.

52:31.440 --> 52:32.800
Fucking kicks ass.

52:32.800 --> 52:38.000
The guy got hung up and everything stopped and he left.

52:38.000 --> 52:38.880
That's all I know about Spider-Man.

52:38.880 --> 52:40.160
That's how it ended every night.

52:40.160 --> 52:42.560
You never knew what would happen.

52:42.560 --> 52:44.400
Eventually, Spider-Man would get stuck

52:44.400 --> 52:46.880
and everybody would bow underneath him.

52:46.880 --> 52:48.000
That was the end of the musical.

52:49.520 --> 52:51.920
Okay, Lin, thanks so much for coming on the show.

52:53.280 --> 52:54.800
It's always such a joy.

52:56.160 --> 52:56.880
Lin, I'm sorry.

52:56.880 --> 53:01.440
No, now I feel bad that we made you talk about dirty video game stuff.

53:01.440 --> 53:03.280
I was, I'm kinda into it.

53:03.280 --> 53:03.920
I'm good.

53:03.920 --> 53:04.400
Oh, good.

53:04.400 --> 53:06.400
All right, I got some websites for you to visit

53:06.400 --> 53:10.480
and I'm sure the rest of the show will help you out with that as well.

53:10.480 --> 53:11.360
Thanks so much, Lin.

53:12.000 --> 53:12.800
Thanks, guys.

53:12.800 --> 53:13.520
Appreciate you.

53:19.440 --> 53:19.940
Whoa.

53:20.960 --> 53:22.320
I wanna munch.

53:22.320 --> 53:23.040
Squad?

53:23.040 --> 53:23.540
Squad!

53:23.540 --> 53:27.700
I want to munch.

53:27.700 --> 53:28.200
Squad!

53:31.380 --> 53:32.100
Welcome to Munch Squad.

53:32.100 --> 53:37.380
It's a podcast with a podcast that features the latest and greatest in brand eating.

53:37.380 --> 53:40.180
I have wanted to give a bit more introspective time

53:40.180 --> 53:44.820
because I wanted to start off with a bit more introspective of a Munch Squad today.

53:44.820 --> 53:48.340
Or at least an introspective lead-in to a Munch Squad.

53:48.340 --> 53:50.020
You know, things are hard right now.

53:50.740 --> 53:52.500
I didn't know if everybody heard about it.

53:52.500 --> 53:54.900
Oh, do tell.

53:54.900 --> 53:59.220
Yeah, it's just Earth and I have one shining light

53:59.780 --> 54:02.020
and I have two kids so you know it's not them.

54:02.020 --> 54:06.340
I have one shining light that keeps me kind of going when things are hard

54:06.340 --> 54:09.060
and that I do include my children in that.

54:09.060 --> 54:09.560
Right.

54:10.500 --> 54:15.140
And it's the fact that somewhere on this big blue marble we call Earth,

54:15.140 --> 54:20.260
every once in a while, the boardroom doors at Papa John's fly open

54:20.260 --> 54:27.060
and you hear and there is a large dent made in the top of the door jam

54:27.780 --> 54:32.020
which then cracks as Shaq blows into the room and announces,

54:32.020 --> 54:35.700
hey idiots, here's the new shit I'm going to lay it out for you

54:35.700 --> 54:40.180
and you're going to do what I say because everybody hates you except for me, Shaq.

54:40.180 --> 54:42.420
The only thing keeping everybody from hating you.

54:43.940 --> 54:48.420
That announcement recently that Shaq made to the boardroom of Papa John's.

54:48.420 --> 54:52.980
Papa John's introduces the extra large shakaroni pizza.

54:52.980 --> 54:53.480
Yep.

54:53.480 --> 54:58.020
Oh, huh, huh, huh.

54:58.020 --> 55:06.740
Is the pizza large or are the individual, I'm sorry, shakaronis?

55:06.740 --> 55:09.300
There's no pepperoni on it.

55:09.300 --> 55:10.180
It is pepperoni.

55:10.180 --> 55:14.980
It is a pepperoni free pizza covered in pepperonis which are now shakaronis.

55:14.980 --> 55:24.340
Papa John's announced Monday the launch of the new shakaroni pizza in collaboration

55:24.340 --> 55:26.980
with board member and restaurant owner Shaquille O'Neal.

55:26.980 --> 55:27.460
No shit.

55:27.460 --> 55:28.420
Don't say.

55:29.140 --> 55:36.420
I wish that it had said in strict defiance of the wishes of Shaquille

55:37.780 --> 55:40.900
who begged us not to make a shakaroni pizza.

55:40.900 --> 55:48.660
Are they smoky, cured, spiced chunks of Shaq?

55:48.660 --> 55:49.780
I don't want that.

55:49.780 --> 55:51.220
No, it's Shaq free.

55:53.860 --> 56:00.340
Papa John's will donate $1 from every shakaroni sold through August 23rd, 2020 to the Papa

56:00.340 --> 56:05.940
John's Foundation for Building Community, which is a very general and non-threatening

56:05.940 --> 56:10.420
name of a group which supports communities as they work together for equality, fairness,

56:10.420 --> 56:12.420
respect, and opportunity for all.

56:12.420 --> 56:13.620
Here's the quote.

56:13.620 --> 56:19.060
It was important to me for the shakaroni to be bigger than just pizza.

56:19.780 --> 56:25.540
By giving my new pie a try, $1 will be donated to the Papa John's Foundation for Building

56:25.540 --> 56:30.820
Community to support COVID-19 relief, the fight against racial injustice, Boys and Girls

56:30.820 --> 56:36.340
Club of America, the United Negro College Fund, and general community involvement, says

56:36.340 --> 56:40.100
O'Neal, Papa John's board member and franchise owner.

56:40.100 --> 56:47.860
Conceived by O'Neal himself, the shakaroni is an extra large pizza made with Papa John's

56:47.860 --> 56:54.820
fresh, never frozen, six ingredient dough topped with extra cheese and extra pepperoni

56:54.820 --> 57:00.500
shakaroni, I think they meant to say, and then cut into Papa John's largest slice size

57:00.500 --> 57:01.300
to date.

57:01.300 --> 57:07.700
Well, now, so I don't mean to be obtuse here, but it sounds like what you're describing

57:07.700 --> 57:10.100
is a big pepperoni pizza.

57:10.100 --> 57:15.220
I guess I'm just confused as to where the shakaroni part comes in.

57:15.220 --> 57:19.380
And let me just say, why not make it like a macaroni and cheese pizza?

57:19.380 --> 57:22.580
Because then shakaroni totally applies.

57:22.580 --> 57:24.900
Well, don't even fucking worry about that, Travis.

57:24.900 --> 57:25.460
Oh?

57:25.460 --> 57:31.060
Because the larger than life pizza is also accompanied by an exclusive Snapchat AR experience

57:31.060 --> 57:38.260
for fans who order the shakaroni using the Snapchat app, customers simply point their

57:38.260 --> 57:41.620
camera at the pizza box to reveal a 3D surprise.

57:41.620 --> 57:48.740
I don't know what the 3D surprise is, but I assume it's Shaq dressed as Kazam announcing

57:48.740 --> 57:50.740
that your pizza wishes have been granted.

57:50.740 --> 57:52.020
What else could it possibly be?

57:52.020 --> 57:56.020
I don't know what else it could possibly be other than that.

57:56.020 --> 58:01.380
Can I just real quick just dial in on the implications of using the phrase larger than

58:01.380 --> 58:07.460
life when describing a pizza, which would imply that this pizza is larger than existence,

58:07.460 --> 58:13.300
I guess, larger than anything you could conceive based around your time here on Earth.

58:13.300 --> 58:19.140
Here's what's very interesting, is that nowhere in the press release does it define

58:19.140 --> 58:21.140
the bounds of the pizza.

58:21.140 --> 58:27.140
It is only in relation to other pizza products from Papa John's.

58:27.140 --> 58:28.820
Maybe it's bigger than Shaq.

58:28.820 --> 58:29.460
It's big.

58:29.460 --> 58:30.420
It's very big.

58:30.420 --> 58:35.060
We can't tell you how big because the law, legally, we can't tell you how big it is,

58:35.060 --> 58:36.260
but it's extremely big.

58:36.260 --> 58:38.980
Perhaps the diameter is one Shaq's worth.

58:40.020 --> 58:42.420
It's a Shaq of, it's a single Shaq of pizza.

58:43.220 --> 58:49.540
Actually, they say it's a, okay, so the CEO of Papa John's, the new good one, I guess,

58:49.540 --> 58:50.180
not the old one.

58:50.180 --> 58:50.580
Right.

58:50.580 --> 58:56.420
We're excited to combine all the best ingredients for coming together in support of our neighbors,

58:56.980 --> 58:58.740
a Shaq-sized pizza.

58:58.740 --> 59:02.900
Now that, to me, I think that's false advertising.

59:02.900 --> 59:03.940
That could be criminal.

59:03.940 --> 59:04.740
Or?

59:04.740 --> 59:12.020
Because if it's a Shaq-shaped pizza, then I think, if it's Shaq-sized, like you have

59:12.020 --> 59:14.420
to have, how tall is Shaq?

59:14.420 --> 59:18.900
Well, now that could mean, that could mean he's 7'1".

59:18.900 --> 59:24.420
So this motherfucker, even Reggie Fils-Aime's great shame, the Bigfoot pizza, was nowhere

59:24.420 --> 59:25.540
near 7'1".

59:25.540 --> 59:31.700
What I'm saying is perhaps it could be the pizza to satiate Shaq.

59:31.700 --> 59:33.700
This is a Shaq-sized pizza.

59:33.700 --> 59:37.460
This is, you have your human-sized pizza, and then you have your Shaq-sized pizza,

59:37.460 --> 59:42.660
just far larger, much like a baby bear, mama bear, papa bear situation.

59:42.660 --> 59:45.540
This pizza for Shaq is just right.

59:45.540 --> 59:52.500
So, okay, theory, the reason that the dimensions are not listed is because it is on a sliding

59:52.500 --> 59:57.140
scale during which, in the morning, Shaq consumes an amount of pizza.

59:57.140 --> 01:00:00.980
He has continually brought pizza until he announces, Shaq has sated.

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:02.180
I will have no more pizza.

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:08.420
And then you know, for that day, that's the day, for that day, that is the size of the

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:09.140
Shaqaroti pizza.

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:14.500
Much like you used to measure the length of the king's forearm, and that was the unit

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:18.100
of measure, and then it would fluctuate based on who the royalty was in question.

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.460
It depends on Shaq.

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:25.220
Maybe Shaq is feeling a little stopped up, hasn't had a good BM in a while, isn't all

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.180
that hungry.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:28.340
That's a tiny pizza that day.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:33.380
He skips pizza that day, because he has a terrible stomach bug.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.460
Because he's only been eating pizza.

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:38.020
That day you order the Shaqaroti pizza, you get nothing.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.140
You get absolutely nothing.

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:41.940
Good day, sir.

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.780
Good day, sir.

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:44.580
You lose.

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:48.500
That's a Shaqaroti pizza.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.780
I think that that's wonderful.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:57.300
I'm so happy that Shaq is finally getting his hands on the dough over there.

01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:00.340
I'm just glad he's finally found something he's comfortable putting his name on.

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:07.140
I have been sitting here trying to think of another way of blending an NBA All-Star player's

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:09.620
name with a type of salami.

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:13.220
And I think it's so bad, man.

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:14.020
So poorly.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:16.740
Mug salami.

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.580
That feels like Punxsutawney Phil's breath.

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:23.140
That's nothing.

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:24.180
Mug salami Phil.

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:30.500
I thought in my head Dikembe Chorizo, but that felt like absolutely nothing.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:33.540
Yeah, I mean, I like the flavor.

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:36.740
Chorizo Barclay?

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:39.540
Like Charles Bar- No, because you can't say that.

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:39.940
You can't.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:41.140
That's like naming.

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:44.180
I have named this pizza Chorizo Barclay.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.460
It's its name.

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:46.020
That's no good.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:46.980
That's no good.

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.220
Well, it sounds like a good-

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.500
Scotty Pippinroni.

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.980
But we already did pepperoni.

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:56.980
We just said Shaq in there.

01:01:58.820 --> 01:01:59.540
That's true.

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:00.040
Fuck.

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:02.820
Folks, thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.020
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:08.180
We hope you're staying safe, staying cool.

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:11.860
Staying cool.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.220
Keeping the heat off.

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.660
Just as important as staying safe, Justin says.

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:17.540
Staying cool.

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.300
And you got to be safe with those fans.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:21.620
Sometimes those fans, those blades move really fast.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.980
They go so fast.

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:23.620
No, thanks.

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:25.700
Sorry, guys.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.820
I'm just looking at a list of NBA all-star names.
