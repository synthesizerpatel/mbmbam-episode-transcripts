00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.080
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother-mean-advice show for the modern era.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.800
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your mentalist brother Travis McElroy.

00:52.800 --> 01:03.200
And I'm Bliss Delight, an intergalactic being of all-encompassing love and light.

01:04.560 --> 01:09.760
Guys, it's good to be back in the studio after traveling through the Ethersphere,

01:09.760 --> 01:12.640
which is a whole thing that you guys haven't even gotten to yet.

01:15.680 --> 01:19.120
This is the second Metamorphoses, if I remember correctly.

01:19.120 --> 01:23.360
Yeah, you know, I came back, I took a sabbatical from being Bliss Delight,

01:23.360 --> 01:27.040
and back then I was just sort of a ball of energy which was sort of launched into space,

01:27.040 --> 01:29.120
hadn't even, I hadn't even hit the Ethersphere yet.

01:29.120 --> 01:33.200
And guys, let me tell you, someday humanity's gonna get there, and that'll be a good day.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.520
What inspired this turnaround, Griffin?

01:36.720 --> 01:40.080
I saw the, I saw the queen last night, I saw-

01:40.080 --> 01:40.720
Queen Elizabeth?

01:41.280 --> 01:45.200
Yes, reincarnated into Carly Rae Jepsen.

01:45.200 --> 01:49.280
Gang, three words, shades of Liza.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.480
Shades of Liza?

01:51.200 --> 01:53.600
There was, there were glimpses of Liza.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.400
God rest her soul, reincarnated into Carly Rae Jepsen.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.640
Okay, that's two women who are not passed away that she's reincarnated as.

02:00.640 --> 02:01.760
She's a lot of women.

02:01.760 --> 02:05.920
She's a future reincarnation of the undeceased Liza Minnelli.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.000
She's every woman.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.920
You know, actually I was at that concert too.

02:11.040 --> 02:12.720
You were not?

02:12.720 --> 02:16.080
I was, it was okay.

02:16.080 --> 02:20.000
I mean, one time I saw Styx in concert, and let me tell you guys, they can put on a show.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.920
See Travis, I'm impervious, I'm impervious to these jests.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.280
No, I said she was good.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.440
Bliss Delight does not recognize haters.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.680
I'm not hating, she was fine, she was good.

02:29.680 --> 02:30.160
Once you become an all-encompassing-

02:30.160 --> 02:31.920
I can really see what she was going for.

02:31.920 --> 02:35.360
Once you become an all-encompassing being of intergalactic love,

02:37.440 --> 02:42.080
it's just like the only emotion that really, emotion, that matters to you at that point.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.840
Once you've sailed through the cosmos-

02:43.840 --> 02:47.200
Guys, I went to Earth Junior, the other Earth that supports-

02:47.200 --> 02:49.040
That's only kids programming.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.440
It supports human-like life.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.320
I have to say, I love Earth Junior, but I'm really into Earth at night

02:58.320 --> 03:00.960
when they start showing old Earths.

03:00.960 --> 03:04.880
And then there's Earth games and sports, which is just like global guts.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.880
I went to Earth Junior just to check out their pop star scene.

03:08.880 --> 03:13.920
Not a lot, there's not a lot going on there in that department.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.280
Interesting planet though, they speak through taste.

03:18.240 --> 03:18.800
What?

03:18.800 --> 03:19.840
That's so different.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.560
Yeah, they have a spray nozzle on their palm.

03:23.120 --> 03:27.040
And then if they want to talk to somebody, that person has to open their mouth

03:27.040 --> 03:29.440
and they spray their flavor into the mouth.

03:29.440 --> 03:33.520
You know, Earth Junior would leave me to believe that they're just the next step.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.280
After Earth comes Earth Junior.

03:37.280 --> 03:43.360
So you're saying we're one step removed from spraying taste for talking.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.880
It's actually a really effective way of getting the job done.

03:46.880 --> 03:52.320
Unfortunately, it's not an effective mode of transmitting pop music.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.360
If there was a Carly Rae Jepsen Earth Juniorite human,

03:58.560 --> 04:01.920
but she would just spray her music into your mouth directly,

04:01.920 --> 04:03.760
fuck, that would be great, actually.

04:03.760 --> 04:07.360
Do you think that we would just coin them as like Tumans?

04:07.360 --> 04:08.560
Yes, absolutely.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.480
I was at that concert too, I wanted to tell you.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.360
I saw Justin there.

04:14.160 --> 04:18.800
I was there, I really liked the music.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.120
Wasn't as crazy about the decor.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.120
My Bloomin' Onion was a little bit substandard.

04:25.120 --> 04:32.800
But my steak was excellently prepared and the $5.99 added skewer of grilled shrimp

04:32.800 --> 04:36.160
was worth all 599 pennies that I paid for it.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.640
How were the rules, Justin?

04:39.280 --> 04:42.800
Well, there weren't any actually there at the concert.

04:42.800 --> 04:43.840
It was just right.

04:43.840 --> 04:44.640
That sounds nice.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.440
I thought it was weird when they had to pivot

04:47.440 --> 04:52.720
and take the concert out of the Austin City Limits music hall

04:52.720 --> 04:54.000
where it was supposed to take place.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.680
And then halfway through the show, she was like,

04:55.680 --> 04:56.560
okay, come with me.

04:56.560 --> 05:00.160
And then we walked the whole crowd and her leading it like a big parade

05:00.160 --> 05:03.200
to the Outback Steakhouse that doesn't exist in Austin.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.840
Yeah, very Andy Kaufman inspired.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.440
They only had Austin City Limits reserved till 8 p.m.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.920
And then it was being taken over by the White Stripes, I think.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.440
Well, the nice thing is if you're already at the Austin City Limits,

05:17.440 --> 05:18.720
you're pretty close to Outback

05:18.720 --> 05:21.520
because they have to put it legally just outside the bounds of the city.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.720
They gotta keep it weird.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.240
Gotta keep it weird.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.000
You know, every my brother and me is somebody,

05:28.000 --> 05:30.480
my brother, my brother, first, my brother, my brother, me.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.480
And I really hope that this is somebody's.

05:32.480 --> 05:33.920
I hope it's Carly Rae Jepsen's first one.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.080
She'll be like, fuck yeah, podcast all about me.

05:36.080 --> 05:36.580
Awesome.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.280
I wish, ZRJ, I wish.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.880
But instead, what we do is we take questions from listeners

05:42.880 --> 05:44.800
and we put them, did she do any covers?

05:46.560 --> 05:46.960
No.

05:46.960 --> 05:47.920
God, what?

05:47.920 --> 05:48.560
No.

05:48.560 --> 05:48.960
God.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.240
Curious if she did covers.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.400
No, she did emotion front to back.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.800
But wouldn't you like to hear her do Purple Rain?

05:54.800 --> 05:56.720
No, I wanna hear her do fucking emotion.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.920
You fucking tell me if ZRJ walked out and was just like,

05:59.920 --> 06:02.160
I'd like to do one that's really close to my heart

06:02.160 --> 06:03.760
and saying fucking Purple Rain,

06:03.760 --> 06:05.760
you wouldn't lose your goddamn mind.

06:05.760 --> 06:06.480
It'd be pretty good.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.640
You know what else would make me totally psyched,

06:08.640 --> 06:11.520
totally just crazy for this?

06:11.520 --> 06:13.440
Would be any other song off emotion.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.600
Okay, two questions, super quick.

06:17.600 --> 06:18.640
Was there an opener?

06:18.640 --> 06:19.360
Yeah, there were two.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.480
Oh, anybody good?

06:22.480 --> 06:22.960
Prince.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.280
There was Carly, and then also Carly Spray Jepsen,

06:29.280 --> 06:31.520
who was the Earth 2 version of Carly Rae Jepsen.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.520
And that was actually pretty horrifying

06:33.520 --> 06:36.560
because our mouths don't possess like the-

06:36.560 --> 06:38.000
Receptacles.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.200
The sensors that are required to understand spray talk.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.040
And so when she just like fucking fully,

06:44.400 --> 06:46.160
you know, Nickelodeon Teen Choice Award,

06:46.160 --> 06:48.080
like blasted us with Gak,

06:48.080 --> 06:49.680
like none of us knew how to accept that.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.320
Was it like a Gallagher show?

06:52.320 --> 06:54.320
A lot of people left and it was a shame.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.520
Just like a Gallagher show.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.720
Yeah, but they missed a good Carly Rae Jepsen concert

06:58.720 --> 06:59.760
is the only bad thing.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.760
It seemed like you had pretty good seats from the photos.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.960
Yeah, well, it's stands.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.560
They were stands, not seats.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.200
They were stands?

07:05.200 --> 07:07.120
We had seats and we were like,

07:08.160 --> 07:09.040
and I said, fuck this,

07:09.040 --> 07:10.320
and they let me exchange the ticket

07:11.200 --> 07:12.720
to be in the dance zone and got it.

07:12.720 --> 07:17.040
Where in the concert did she drop Call Me Maybe?

07:17.040 --> 07:18.480
Close to the end.

07:19.200 --> 07:19.680
It was it?

07:19.680 --> 07:19.920
Yeah.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.040
I've been to the place that loses its mind?

07:21.920 --> 07:22.880
Yeah, everybody went crazy.

07:22.880 --> 07:23.840
But I mean, she closed with,

07:23.840 --> 07:26.240
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.760
And I went, I mean, do you want me?

07:27.760 --> 07:29.920
Hey gang, hey gang, can I talk to you for a second?

07:29.920 --> 07:31.680
If you think for like a second

07:31.680 --> 07:34.000
that even an ounce of this is ironic,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.240
put yourself in a toilet and then flush it

07:36.240 --> 07:37.360
like in the Harry Potter movies.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.760
We are never ironic on this show.

07:40.400 --> 07:40.880
Very rarely.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.920
Yeah, we occasionally are,

07:43.920 --> 07:46.160
but I work really hard to eschew irony.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.960
Like if we talk about Meet the Deedles,

07:48.960 --> 07:51.520
it's because it's a fucking dope movie everybody should watch.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.480
I do want to say-

07:52.480 --> 07:55.360
Sincere irony, that's what our brand is.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.560
Sincere irony.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.560
I do want to say since living in Austin,

08:00.560 --> 08:02.080
like the entire five years I've lived here,

08:02.080 --> 08:04.400
I've run into maybe like two people who were like,

08:04.400 --> 08:05.280
hey, I listen to the show.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.520
And that's really, really neat.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.440
Last night at the Carly Rae Jepsen concert,

08:09.440 --> 08:12.960
I ran into maybe nine people who were like,

08:12.960 --> 08:15.600
great job, Griffin, you're here for the big night.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.120
And I love that all of that,

08:17.120 --> 08:21.520
like this relationship building took place at CRJ.

08:21.520 --> 08:22.000
It was meant to be.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.120
Of course it did.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.640
It's a better sampling of people.

08:24.640 --> 08:24.880
Yeah.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.240
It's a better class of human.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.720
Can I tell you guys my favorite fan spotting moment

08:28.720 --> 08:30.480
I've had since we started the show?

08:30.480 --> 08:31.920
And it happened very, very recently

08:31.920 --> 08:33.520
when Bradbury was in town,

08:33.520 --> 08:36.480
he and I were walking into this wizard themed shop

08:36.480 --> 08:38.320
here in Los Angeles called Whimsic Alley.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.360
It's amazing.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.800
But I was talking to Bradbury

08:40.800 --> 08:43.200
and this group of people turned around and were like, Travis?

08:43.200 --> 08:44.240
And I was like, yeah.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.840
And they're like, we're big fans of my brother.

08:45.840 --> 08:46.400
My brother and me.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.800
And one of the guys looks at me and goes, Andrew Johnson.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.240
And I thought he was introducing himself,

08:52.240 --> 08:54.480
but actually he was chastising me

08:54.480 --> 08:57.040
for not knowing who Andrew Johnson was.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.120
And to just really drive it home,

08:59.120 --> 09:00.880
I had, this was like the day

09:00.880 --> 09:03.360
after we put out the Andrew Johnson episode

09:03.360 --> 09:04.400
and I'd already forgotten.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.760
And I just went, oh yeah.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.320
And he went like the episode.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.200
I was like, oh yeah, yeah.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.920
I've already forgotten who Andrew Johnson is again.

09:11.920 --> 09:12.400
Excellent.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.560
Like I cannot hold Andrew Johnson.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.720
He's like the silence from Doctor Who.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.960
I can't hold Andrew Johnson in my mind.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.800
I want to, we need to get into the advice

09:22.800 --> 09:23.600
because we're going a little,

09:24.560 --> 09:26.320
it's been, it's a little laborious.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.360
People get it.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.680
I love Carly Rae Jepsen and the two of you.

09:30.720 --> 09:31.760
We're also there.

09:31.760 --> 09:32.720
You were there.

09:33.280 --> 09:35.360
But I want to mention this Facebook post that I saw

09:35.360 --> 09:37.520
right before we started recording from Rick Steves,

09:37.520 --> 09:40.560
the travel author and travel video man.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.480
Justin, you know Rick Steves, right?

09:42.480 --> 09:43.520
From Rick, I don't know.

09:43.520 --> 09:44.640
Rick Steves Europe.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.640
You know Rick Steves.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.160
He's an amazing travel man.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.960
He has one of my favorite NPR shows about traveling.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.560
He's an amazing travel man.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.960
He's a beautiful old soul and he travels

09:54.960 --> 09:56.800
and he does TV shows about it.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.400
And he did a Facebook post

09:58.400 --> 09:59.920
and there's a picture in the Facebook post

09:59.920 --> 10:02.400
and it's this old, beautiful soul man.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.560
And he's holding a wine glass

10:04.560 --> 10:06.400
and he's sitting at a piano

10:06.400 --> 10:09.200
and there's some Chopin sheet music at the piano.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.000
But wait a minute, that's not wine in that wine glass.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.800
It's about 30 gigantic weed nuggets

10:14.800 --> 10:16.160
and he's holding one in his hand

10:16.160 --> 10:17.280
and he's grinning like,

10:18.320 --> 10:20.240
next stop, Rick Steves is going to take you

10:20.240 --> 10:21.920
to the fucking Blaze Zone.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.680
And he has a really impassioned post about,

10:25.680 --> 10:27.840
I'm Rick Steves and if I want to get blazed

10:27.840 --> 10:29.760
because I just went on a trip with my whole family

10:29.760 --> 10:31.840
to the fucking black forests of Germany

10:31.840 --> 10:33.280
to check out their hostels

10:33.280 --> 10:34.400
and it was a stressful trip

10:34.400 --> 10:36.720
and now I want to come home and get fucking blazed

10:36.720 --> 10:38.560
in my house, that's my fucking right.

10:38.560 --> 10:39.680
I'm Rick Steves.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.320
That's a good point.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.680
He's got every right to go get blazed.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.360
Oh, now look at the picture.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.640
It's fucking dope.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.560
Isn't that the best picture I've ever seen?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.000
All right, let's do the show.

10:48.000 --> 10:48.720
That's good.

10:48.720 --> 10:49.840
Oh, you know what sets it off

10:49.840 --> 10:51.760
is the fucking book of Chopin.

10:51.760 --> 10:54.640
He's just sat down to play a little.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.080
And I just, I want everyone to know,

10:56.080 --> 10:56.880
look at this picture

10:56.880 --> 10:58.720
and then picture the two seconds

10:58.720 --> 10:59.840
after the picture was taken,

10:59.840 --> 11:02.240
he just pops a nug into his mouth and eats it.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.120
Like popcorn.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.080
I fuck, like I'm imagining,

11:08.080 --> 11:10.800
what I would really enjoy is being there at this concert

11:11.440 --> 11:13.920
just to listen to Rick Steves play Chopin beautifully

11:13.920 --> 11:15.920
and then listen to it get progressively worse.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.400
Hey, now here's another one for Chopin.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.560
Plink, plonk, plink, plonk, plink.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.120
What do you think?

11:23.120 --> 11:25.200
This next one's my favorite Chopin song.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.360
Hey now, you're an all star.

11:27.360 --> 11:28.320
Get your game on.

11:30.240 --> 11:34.240
Hold on, I'm trying to save this image to my heart.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.640
So this is as you've almost certainly gathered.

11:36.640 --> 11:37.840
People know what's up.

11:37.840 --> 11:41.840
This is a Rick Steves fan cast.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.720
Time to do the damn thing.

11:45.360 --> 11:46.960
For years, I've always had the problem

11:46.960 --> 11:48.960
of people assuming I don't know a lot

11:48.960 --> 11:50.880
about common knowledge subjects

11:50.880 --> 11:54.320
or how to do basic tasks like cook or small home repairs.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.520
In fairness, it usually only comes

11:55.520 --> 11:56.800
from people who don't know me very well.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.640
Still, I find these assumptions insulting

11:58.640 --> 12:00.400
and damaging to my confidence

12:00.400 --> 12:02.640
and would like a subtle way of letting people know

12:02.640 --> 12:04.000
that they're out of line.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.320
Yeah, I know how to clean a cast iron skillet

12:06.320 --> 12:07.600
is the name of that question asker.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.880
Travis, how do you deal with this?

12:11.200 --> 12:13.280
I'm a fairly capable human being.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.120
Yeah, that's not...

12:16.640 --> 12:19.520
I feel like this is gonna be leveraged against anybody.

12:19.520 --> 12:20.560
I don't think it would be Travis.

12:20.560 --> 12:24.640
I'm talking about people assuming.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.760
I actually saw a Twitter exchange last night

12:27.760 --> 12:28.800
where somebody was like,

12:28.800 --> 12:32.000
Travis wouldn't like something about Travis

12:32.000 --> 12:34.160
doing construction, how badly it would turn out.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.520
And Travis talked about how he was a carpenter,

12:37.520 --> 12:38.880
a stage carpenter for a long time,

12:38.880 --> 12:40.640
and he knows his way around a saw.

12:40.640 --> 12:41.440
I don't know why...

12:41.440 --> 12:43.840
He also said that if I touched a saw,

12:43.840 --> 12:44.880
I would have a heart attack, which-

12:44.880 --> 12:47.200
No, no, no, he said if you touched the table saw,

12:47.200 --> 12:47.680
you'd die.

12:48.560 --> 12:48.960
I'd die.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.960
I don't know why I felt compelled to tear me down.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.280
I do my fair share of home improvement projects.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.080
But yeah, but I don't know.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.960
It seems like for some reason,

12:58.960 --> 13:01.040
people assume Travis is less capable

13:01.040 --> 13:02.880
just because back in 2010,

13:02.880 --> 13:05.200
he thought that the weather he saw outside his window

13:05.200 --> 13:06.720
was the same weather all over the planet.

13:07.840 --> 13:10.000
It's amazing how much shit like that sticks with you.

13:10.560 --> 13:13.280
What a difference six years makes, right, gang?

13:13.280 --> 13:13.760
Yeah.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.040
Well, I went back to school.

13:16.880 --> 13:17.840
Here's what I've learned.

13:17.840 --> 13:18.640
Kindergarten.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.320
I'm gonna tell you the truth, question asker.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.320
Here's what you need to keep in mind.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.880
Everybody on this planet

13:24.880 --> 13:28.000
knows so very little off the top of their head.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.520
Like the idea that people in this day and age

13:31.520 --> 13:34.320
know as much as we did before we had like phones

13:34.320 --> 13:36.480
and computers to just tell us stuff whenever.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.720
Like people used to have to hold this shit in their head

13:38.720 --> 13:40.960
all the time and just memorize it and know it.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.600
So when someone does have a piece of knowledge

13:43.600 --> 13:45.600
that they know off the top of their head,

13:45.600 --> 13:48.400
they're so proud to whip that out

13:48.400 --> 13:50.080
and tell you how to do the thing

13:50.640 --> 13:53.280
that you just need to let them have that precious moment

13:53.280 --> 13:56.240
of like, I know how to clean a cast iron skillet.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.840
I'm gonna tell you how to do it.

13:57.840 --> 13:58.800
You just have to sit there

13:58.800 --> 14:00.880
and let them feel special for a moment

14:00.880 --> 14:02.160
and then go on about your day.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.000
Fuck that, no way.

14:04.960 --> 14:08.480
You're saying that he should just let them

14:09.440 --> 14:11.520
run wild on them with their trivia?

14:11.520 --> 14:12.240
Just for a second,

14:12.240 --> 14:13.840
because everybody's got that thing

14:13.840 --> 14:14.720
that they know how to do

14:14.720 --> 14:16.720
that they're so proud that they know how to do it.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.480
If they're using that knowledge

14:20.480 --> 14:22.400
to actively make you feel small

14:22.400 --> 14:24.400
for not knowing the thing, then fuck them.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.200
That's garbage.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.480
Well, it is in the delivery

14:27.040 --> 14:29.440
because if they're like, helpful hint time,

14:29.440 --> 14:32.000
let me like Mr. Goodbody, Mr. Roger,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.640
share a helpful tip with you, that's great.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.480
If they're like, let me make you feel stupid

14:36.480 --> 14:37.920
because I know how to do this and you don't.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.520
Have you seen those posts of like,

14:39.520 --> 14:41.440
it's a picture of a guy with like a beard

14:41.440 --> 14:44.240
and it's like, if you don't know how to change a tire,

14:44.240 --> 14:46.960
like you should shave, fuck that shit.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.560
Like, I hate that.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.000
But the idea of like, you know what?

14:50.000 --> 14:52.160
Most people don't know how to do most things.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.080
Like, if you think about all the things

14:54.080 --> 14:56.160
there are to know how to do in the world,

14:56.160 --> 14:57.360
how many of them do you know?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.120
A very slight percentage.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.080
Yeah, like three.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.720
Rick Steves can't change a tire.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.440
Actually, that's not true.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.880
He travels a bunch, I bet he-

15:04.880 --> 15:06.720
I bet that fool knows how to do most things.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.480
I bet he's road wise, but-

15:10.080 --> 15:13.760
I bet Rick Steves knows how to do pretty much anything.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.680
Now, you've called him Rick Steves.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.040
I can't help but notice.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.480
Yeah, that's when he's blazed.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.000
That's his blaze name?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.720
Steves, his blaze name is Rick Steves.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.800
What's your blaze name, Justin?

15:24.800 --> 15:25.680
Justin McElroy.

15:25.680 --> 15:29.040
I've always, I'm always blazed.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.400
Let me tell you my secret.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.440
I'm always blazed.

15:31.440 --> 15:34.960
There's gonna be a weird episode of Mabim Bam in the future

15:34.960 --> 15:37.280
where Justin's like, hi, my name is Derek,

15:37.280 --> 15:39.680
and I'm ready to get a lot of stuff done today.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.680
Are you ready, advice boys?

15:42.400 --> 15:43.360
What the fuck?

15:43.360 --> 15:44.800
No, this is me.

15:44.800 --> 15:45.300
Yeah.

15:46.480 --> 15:50.400
The part of this question that's kind of tripping me up

15:50.400 --> 15:54.480
is that the person finds the assumptions

15:54.480 --> 15:56.720
insulting and damaging to their confidence.

15:56.720 --> 16:01.200
Listen, you are giving your power away,

16:01.200 --> 16:04.160
and it is completely unnecessary.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.760
You don't have to let anybody,

16:05.760 --> 16:08.960
people can only make you feel the way you let them

16:08.960 --> 16:09.460
make you feel.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.920
I think a big part of life and trying to maintain

16:16.720 --> 16:20.960
is deciding how much you're gonna let people in

16:20.960 --> 16:22.800
with the way that they're treating you

16:22.800 --> 16:24.960
and how much you're gonna let that affect your mood

16:24.960 --> 16:26.320
and your own view of yourself.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.960
I mean, if someone assumes you don't know how to do something

16:28.960 --> 16:31.040
and you do know how to do it

16:31.040 --> 16:32.960
that says more about them than it does about you,

16:32.960 --> 16:34.640
don't let that take away your own,

16:35.840 --> 16:37.760
you know, your own confidence in yourself

16:37.760 --> 16:38.800
because it's, I mean.

16:38.800 --> 16:39.920
Yeah, if you can't love yourself,

16:39.920 --> 16:41.680
how in the hell you gonna love anybody else?

16:41.680 --> 16:42.400
Can I get an amen?

16:43.200 --> 16:44.240
Amen, amen.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.120
Now let the music play.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.480
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

16:46.480 --> 16:46.980
Sure.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.800
This Yahoo was sent in by Morgan Davey.

16:50.800 --> 16:51.360
Thank you, Morgan.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.840
It's by Yahoo Answers user Conley who asks,

16:54.640 --> 16:56.320
jealous of other people's boats?

16:57.520 --> 16:59.600
I don't have a boat or jet ski,

16:59.600 --> 17:01.920
but I do enjoy kayaking and paddle boarding.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.720
Whenever I go out to a lake with boats and jet skis,

17:04.720 --> 17:06.400
all that I can think about the whole time

17:06.400 --> 17:07.920
is how much I want one of those.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.800
People I know have them.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.000
It bothers me so much.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.200
I am 15.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.160
How do I get over this?

17:14.800 --> 17:15.300
Wow.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.360
How do I get over this?

17:17.360 --> 17:19.200
Does anybody else feel like this?

17:19.200 --> 17:20.800
That's a lot of babysitting jobs.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.000
Okay, wait, wait, hold on.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.440
To get a boat.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.720
So that I can understand,

17:26.160 --> 17:27.120
because he doesn't,

17:27.120 --> 17:28.000
or question asked,

17:28.000 --> 17:28.880
it doesn't quite say,

17:30.720 --> 17:32.720
are we to assume that they have a kayak

17:32.720 --> 17:35.840
or they have some sort of non-motored boat?

17:37.120 --> 17:40.320
I think it's possible that they have a kayak.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.240
They have a super puffy life jacket.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.240
Okay, but what we're gonna picture

17:44.240 --> 17:46.320
is that they're out on a said lake

17:46.320 --> 17:48.000
in a non-motored boat

17:48.000 --> 17:51.680
and a jet ski or motored boat goes flying past them

17:51.680 --> 17:53.200
and they're like, man, that's better.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.240
If I had a jet ski,

17:54.240 --> 17:56.800
I would make little punks like this eat wake,

17:56.800 --> 17:58.880
like 24 seven, right?

17:58.880 --> 17:59.380
Yeah.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.560
This is, but, and I get it,

18:02.560 --> 18:04.480
because when you're paddling a boat

18:04.480 --> 18:06.400
with like your human arms

18:06.400 --> 18:09.680
and then you see like a mechanical engineering marvel

18:09.680 --> 18:11.840
go flying past you, yeah.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.920
It's like you are tapping into the deepest,

18:13.920 --> 18:16.080
most primal human impulse.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.160
It's like, ah, no more row.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.360
No more row.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.120
Row bad.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.560
Motorboat, good.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.800
It could, but it could also just be like

18:24.800 --> 18:27.760
this 15 year old has already made up their mind

18:27.760 --> 18:30.160
about the trajectory they want their life to take,

18:30.160 --> 18:32.080
which is to say ocean work.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.480
Their life, their love, their lady is the sea.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.520
They wanna get out there

18:35.520 --> 18:37.840
and see what's up in the deep ocean.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.560
And they wanna get started early.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.240
I'm fucking into that, man.

18:42.240 --> 18:43.680
No, listen, I get it.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.760
And I'm not saying that there's not a beautiful time

18:45.760 --> 18:47.440
to like paddle a canoe down a river

18:47.440 --> 18:48.560
and you're like, I get it.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.320
This is me, this is danger.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.400
But listen, jet skis are made for one thing

18:52.400 --> 18:54.320
and one thing alone, fun.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.600
Also sweet tricks and probably ocean rescue,

18:57.600 --> 18:58.560
but mostly fun.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.800
And surfer towing.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.200
And surfer towing, but mostly fun.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.440
And also maybe like dolphin petting.

19:05.440 --> 19:10.400
I would argue that also that sweet stunts are fun too.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.480
Yeah, but I mean it all falls under

19:12.480 --> 19:13.680
saving people from the ocean,

19:13.680 --> 19:16.480
petting dolphins and sick tricks all fall under fun.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.000
And carving wake.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.360
Where does carving wake fit in?

19:19.360 --> 19:20.720
That's actually work, yeah.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.840
That's a job, to carve wake in the ocean.

19:23.840 --> 19:24.640
Because that's what makes the waves.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.240
So it looks sweet for astronauts?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.520
Oh fuck yeah, thanks Jeremy.

19:30.160 --> 19:31.920
But even when you're on your jet ski,

19:31.920 --> 19:33.440
that rocket goes flying up past you.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.560
You're like, well now I want that.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.920
Hell yeah, look at that sweet wake he's carving out.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.080
Oh shit, he drew Jerry Garcia.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.280
Fuck that's dope.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.240
Thank you so much.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.760
God, that's awesome.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.600
Hold on guys, hold on.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.600
He writes down thanks Jeremy on a piece of paper

19:47.600 --> 19:49.360
and just like blasts it out the airlock.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.280
That'll get to him.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.680
As Jeremy slams his Capri Sun.

19:53.680 --> 19:54.880
Great wake Jeremy.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.880
I want a kid captain.

19:56.880 --> 20:00.480
Captain kid, the kid captain sailing the ocean.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.920
If this kid is gonna be 15 and gonna own a boat,

20:03.920 --> 20:05.040
he needs to fully like,

20:05.680 --> 20:07.200
I want a full blank check kind of deal

20:07.200 --> 20:10.400
where he's wearing like a love boat style captain's hat.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.280
I want the jacket with the buttons on them

20:13.280 --> 20:15.680
with anchors on the buttons,

20:15.680 --> 20:18.720
like looking very cool, very traditional,

20:18.720 --> 20:21.200
like very stern task master,

20:21.200 --> 20:23.360
like captain kid, the kid captain,

20:23.360 --> 20:25.840
15 year old out there on,

20:25.840 --> 20:27.040
I want a big boat though.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.560
Like a 15 year old on a jet ski,

20:28.560 --> 20:29.920
I would think like you little punk.

20:29.920 --> 20:34.800
Well, if I see like a jet ski is just a motorbike for a while.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.920
I love that what you're pitching

20:35.920 --> 20:38.000
is like a sequel to Little Big League,

20:38.000 --> 20:42.400
but it's like a kid inherits his grandpa's pirate boat

20:43.520 --> 20:44.560
and the crew's just like,

20:44.560 --> 20:46.240
well, we're signed on for 10 years,

20:46.240 --> 20:47.440
so I guess we're stuck here.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.040
Okay, I'm sorry.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.040
Trademark, trademark, trademark.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.400
That's a great idea.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.000
Also, he broke his arm

20:54.000 --> 20:55.760
and it makes him really good at sailing.

20:55.760 --> 20:56.320
Uh-huh.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.520
He's the fastest sailor

20:57.520 --> 20:59.680
because of how quickly he can turn the wheel

20:59.680 --> 21:00.960
which powers the boat.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.800
He can yoink the anchor and run the jib so fast.

21:04.800 --> 21:05.440
So good.

21:05.440 --> 21:06.800
Funky kid jib.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.640
Funky butt loving that's a fast jib.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.680
Did he just say funky butt loving that's a fast jib?

21:13.520 --> 21:14.720
Which one of the three of us...

21:15.760 --> 21:17.920
Listen, time for another Bim Bam Superlative.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.200
Everybody's favorite segment.

21:19.200 --> 21:23.520
Which one of the three of us is most likely to own boat?

21:23.520 --> 21:26.800
And also for bonus credit, what would we name it?

21:27.520 --> 21:29.120
I think the answer is Justin.

21:30.240 --> 21:30.880
Correct?

21:30.880 --> 21:32.800
Yeah, I think, well, just because like,

21:32.800 --> 21:36.320
I think Huntington, you could probably house a boat

21:36.320 --> 21:38.800
like a lot easier than you could.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.560
And Justin also strikes as the type of person

21:40.560 --> 21:43.840
who would see boat and be like, yeah, and just get it.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.160
I'll take a boat.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.440
Yeah, boat, sure.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.360
He'd go down to the local boat show

21:49.360 --> 21:51.360
at the Big Sandy Superstore Arena.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.480
I just don't know that I would...

21:55.120 --> 21:56.160
Here's my fear.

21:56.160 --> 21:59.520
I don't think I'd use the boat a lot.

21:59.520 --> 21:59.840
No.

21:59.840 --> 22:03.120
I feel like I would spend a lot of money housing it.

22:03.760 --> 22:06.960
It would metaphorically collect dust in your front closet.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.800
I would not get out there very often.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.840
I feel like I don't think it would be a good investment.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.640
And I hear that from a lot of boat owners that like-

22:14.640 --> 22:15.920
Or boners as I call them.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.840
There's an old saying that the two happiest days

22:20.400 --> 22:22.320
in your life are the day you buy your boat

22:23.120 --> 22:24.560
and the day your first child's born.

22:25.280 --> 22:29.360
And then after that, you sell your boat.

22:29.360 --> 22:34.480
I thought you said the day you buy your boat

22:34.480 --> 22:37.040
and then the day you either sell or crash your boat.

22:37.920 --> 22:41.440
That is actually to say that I don't think is well known enough

22:41.440 --> 22:43.760
for me to have turned into a joke.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.680
The joke is the two happiest days of your life

22:45.680 --> 22:47.680
are the day you buy your boat and the day you sell your boat,

22:47.680 --> 22:50.160
which I thought that was a well-known enough

22:50.160 --> 22:54.320
that I could sort of twist it in my trademark skewed perspective.

22:54.320 --> 23:01.600
So you thought it was like a boat proverb that everybody-

23:01.600 --> 23:04.560
Yeah, a boat proverb everybody knows.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.880
It could be you uncultured fucks just don't know it.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.920
This is my night at the museum where they'll be like,

23:09.920 --> 23:11.120
oh yeah, everybody knows that saying.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.000
It's a classic.

23:12.000 --> 23:12.880
I want to be clear here.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.160
I did know that saying.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.080
Thank you, Travis.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.360
I did know it.

23:17.360 --> 23:19.920
Well, you guys eat at Cracker Barrel more than I do, I guess.

23:19.920 --> 23:20.800
That's true.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.600
And I read a lot more New Yorker and Ziggy comics.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.560
And you read a lot more of the novelty signs

23:26.560 --> 23:27.840
that they sell at Cracker Barrel.

23:27.840 --> 23:28.720
So many of them.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.800
Like I would say obsessively,

23:30.800 --> 23:34.560
like sometimes I'll be there for hours just reading the signs.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.360
Hey, listen, two words for you guys.

23:38.000 --> 23:38.800
Jaden Smith.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.120
Is that the name of your boat?

23:43.120 --> 23:47.920
Get captain the captain kid Jaden Smith running his crew.

23:47.920 --> 23:48.880
How good would that be?

23:48.880 --> 23:49.520
I'd be very good.

23:49.520 --> 23:50.960
He's not so much a child anymore though.

23:50.960 --> 23:51.760
He's kind of a big boy.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.840
He's kind of a Jonathan lymph Nicky.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.360
Well, he's also a bigger boy.

23:55.360 --> 23:56.240
He actually got bone.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.600
Haley Joel Osmond.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.160
Absolutely.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.360
Can you read another question?

23:59.360 --> 24:00.160
Willow Smith.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.560
I'd rather have Willow, frankly.

24:04.720 --> 24:07.600
I am naming my boat Jaden Smith.

24:07.600 --> 24:08.480
Yeah, absolutely.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.280
Thank you.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.480
Captain by Willow Smith.

24:11.440 --> 24:14.640
How do I ask my roommate who I never interact with

24:14.640 --> 24:15.440
if I can get a cat?

24:16.160 --> 24:17.920
I don't want to get one without asking.

24:17.920 --> 24:18.800
That'd be pretty rude.

24:19.520 --> 24:21.520
But we're both home at the same time.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.200
She goes and hangs in a room.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.280
The most we say to each other is hello

24:25.280 --> 24:26.560
and that's how our days were.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.720
I really don't know how to casually bring up the topic

24:28.720 --> 24:30.960
of a kitten in that small amount of time.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.000
Any advice on how I should approach the topic?

24:34.560 --> 24:35.600
That's from Gmail.

24:35.600 --> 24:40.080
So you have currently a creature that lives in your house

24:40.080 --> 24:42.160
that doesn't pay a lot of attention to you.

24:42.160 --> 24:42.560
Yeah.

24:42.560 --> 24:45.200
And like you walk in, they greet you and then go away.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.160
You already own a cat.

24:46.160 --> 24:46.800
You own a human cat.

24:46.800 --> 24:47.920
Yeah, you have a cat.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.520
You have a roommate cat human.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.600
This could be a reverse Hocus Pocus situation.

24:52.320 --> 24:52.720
Cats.

24:52.720 --> 24:53.440
How do you mean?

24:53.440 --> 24:54.800
You know how the human became a cat?

24:55.520 --> 24:57.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.240
In Hocus Pocus, the movie?

24:59.040 --> 25:00.800
I went and saw the witch recently.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.520
I was sold that it was basically a spiritual sequel

25:03.520 --> 25:04.960
to Hocus Pocus.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.160
No, no.

25:06.720 --> 25:07.520
It was not?

25:07.520 --> 25:08.080
No.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.280
First of all, was it spookier?

25:09.280 --> 25:10.240
No to Jimmy.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.640
Significantly spookier, I would say.

25:12.640 --> 25:16.000
Like on a scale of Hocus Pocus to Sabrina the Teenage Witch,

25:16.000 --> 25:17.760
the spookiest thing I've ever seen.

25:17.760 --> 25:18.000
Okay.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.040
How spooky was it?

25:19.040 --> 25:20.880
There's a part of Hocus Pocus where Kathy and Jimmy

25:20.880 --> 25:22.000
rides around on a vacuum cleaner.

25:22.800 --> 25:23.680
That's funny.

25:23.680 --> 25:24.400
That's funny.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.120
It is funny.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.600
It is funny because it's kind of a modern broom.

25:28.240 --> 25:32.240
I don't know a problem that you solve with a cat

25:32.240 --> 25:34.480
that you don't less depressingly solve

25:35.120 --> 25:37.440
by getting to know your roommate a little bit better.

25:37.440 --> 25:38.560
I just feel like-

25:38.560 --> 25:40.080
And we're all three cat owners.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.360
Let's be clear here.

25:41.360 --> 25:41.920
Yeah.

25:41.920 --> 25:44.000
Yeah, I have two cats.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.280
You have one and a half cats.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.640
Well, no, CJ's one and a half cat.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.080
Yeah, CJ's one and a half cats.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.920
And then I have a border who is a cat

25:51.920 --> 25:54.640
that has nothing to do with me or anybody.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.680
She is renting and what she pays is turds.

25:59.680 --> 26:02.400
I guess she pays in turds.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.520
That's currency.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.840
Anyway, Amelia is the cat no man has touched.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.600
Nobody's ever touched that fucking cat.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.160
It's the worst.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.840
I'm not saying that this is going to work.

26:09.840 --> 26:13.840
I'm saying you should make a go of it first with your roommate

26:13.840 --> 26:15.440
before you buy the cat

26:15.440 --> 26:20.080
because it works both ways.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.480
One, you form a bond and you think like,

26:22.480 --> 26:22.880
you know what?

26:22.880 --> 26:24.240
I don't really need a cat right now.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.160
I have a new sort of relationship

26:26.160 --> 26:27.360
that I'm trying to foster

26:27.360 --> 26:29.520
or you become close enough to them

26:29.520 --> 26:32.880
where you can say, listen, this isn't working for me.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.160
I need to buy a cat.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.240
Or third option, you get to use the phrase,

26:36.240 --> 26:37.200
we should get a cat.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.440
We should get a cat together

26:39.440 --> 26:42.480
and use it to help our friendship develop.

26:42.480 --> 26:43.760
We need this.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.520
We can combine our names

26:45.520 --> 26:47.840
and smush them together in a portmanteau

26:47.840 --> 26:50.320
and it'll be like our cat that we share together.

26:50.320 --> 26:51.520
You are absolutely correct though

26:51.520 --> 26:54.240
that you should not get a cat without asking your roommate.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.800
Well, yeah, Travis, I think that's illegal.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.600
You would be amazed, Griffin,

26:59.600 --> 27:01.760
how many people I know have told me stories

27:01.760 --> 27:03.520
about their roommate just bringing home animals

27:03.520 --> 27:05.120
and be like, we own a dog now

27:05.120 --> 27:07.840
or we own a cat now and be like, well, fuck.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.280
Shit, Stephanie, I got bad news.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.040
I completely spaced

27:11.040 --> 27:13.040
and I totally forgot to tell you about this,

27:13.040 --> 27:14.000
but we bought a zoo.

27:16.080 --> 27:16.960
Yeah, we bought a zoo.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.080
You live in a zoo now.

27:18.080 --> 27:18.960
There's lemurs and stuff.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.400
I think it's gonna bring me and my daughter together

27:20.400 --> 27:22.000
because her mom, you know, kicked it.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.760
But anyway, lemurs, zebra, it's gonna be great, Deborah.

27:25.760 --> 27:27.200
I mean, Stephanie, fuck.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.720
I have a good way into this conversation

27:28.720 --> 27:30.640
because I'm assuming that's the only thing

27:30.640 --> 27:31.600
this person's asking for

27:31.600 --> 27:32.880
since they obviously do have a way

27:32.880 --> 27:34.720
of like getting in contact with their roommate.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.000
They're not in the fandom zone.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.960
Like they can reach them.

27:36.960 --> 27:40.640
I would say to them,

27:40.640 --> 27:42.800
hey, a quick question.

27:42.800 --> 27:43.920
Do you have any allergies?

27:44.800 --> 27:46.160
And then they would answer

27:46.160 --> 27:49.040
and you would be like, okay, cool, thank you.

27:49.040 --> 27:50.320
Because I was thinking about getting some milk

27:50.320 --> 27:51.200
on the way home.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.560
And if you're really allergic to milk,

27:53.680 --> 27:55.520
then I didn't wanna have it in the house.

27:55.520 --> 27:56.400
It was gonna mess you up.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.280
The milk's for a cat.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.960
And then walk out.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.320
Well, you went in a different way

28:00.320 --> 28:01.440
than I would have thought.

28:02.000 --> 28:02.960
It's a little disappointing

28:02.960 --> 28:04.000
because I was just about to comment

28:04.000 --> 28:06.160
on how like disquietingly good you are

28:06.160 --> 28:07.760
at the back door conversation.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.320
Well, mine was a joke,

28:10.320 --> 28:12.640
but the initial thing is actually,

28:12.640 --> 28:13.600
I think would be pretty good

28:13.600 --> 28:16.080
because that makes you seem considerate.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.480
Like, oh, thank you for asking about that.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.120
That's really nice.

28:20.160 --> 28:23.680
But it's like you're opening this conversation

28:23.680 --> 28:25.360
where you're asking for something

28:25.360 --> 28:27.280
by a considerate act,

28:27.280 --> 28:29.520
which is like a really good entryway

28:30.080 --> 28:32.240
into an awkward conversation.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.040
Okay, here, let's try that out.

28:35.040 --> 28:35.840
I will be the roommate

28:35.840 --> 28:37.600
and Justin just like throw that at me, okay?

28:37.600 --> 28:39.200
Hey, I meant to ask you,

28:39.200 --> 28:40.560
do you have any allergies?

28:40.560 --> 28:42.160
Cats, I'm definitely allergic to cats.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.360
Oh God, bring a cat around me.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.760
I flood my attic,

28:45.760 --> 28:46.880
by which I mean I sneeze

28:46.880 --> 28:48.160
and I get stuffy and stuff.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.800
Can you, well, oh, no problem.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.480
Seriously, one time I saw a video

28:52.480 --> 28:53.760
of a cat on YouTube

28:53.760 --> 28:55.280
and I went into anaphylactic shock.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.120
Good news, we're getting a skunk.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.200
Then you buy a black cat,

29:01.200 --> 29:02.320
white stripe on the back,

29:02.320 --> 29:02.560
paint it there.

29:02.560 --> 29:03.760
Your roommate dies.

29:03.760 --> 29:04.880
It's fucking foolproof.

29:04.880 --> 29:05.760
Full proof.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.520
What if you just left your front door open

29:07.520 --> 29:08.880
until a cat wandered in

29:08.880 --> 29:10.480
and then you just have to keep it?

29:11.680 --> 29:13.120
I can't catch this darn thing.

29:13.120 --> 29:15.040
Yeah, fucking castle doctrine.

29:15.040 --> 29:17.200
I guess this is what he called sanctuary.

29:17.200 --> 29:17.680
This is our cat now.

29:17.680 --> 29:19.040
I am 90% sure

29:19.040 --> 29:20.880
that that is what castle doctrine is.

29:20.880 --> 29:21.680
To go to my zone.

29:21.680 --> 29:33.200
Meow.

29:33.200 --> 29:34.720
I want to talk about Trunk Club.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.480
Oh, thank God.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.400
I just did it.

29:38.960 --> 29:41.760
It's my elephant appreciation society.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.120
Your time.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.480
I'm in the Trunk Club.

29:44.480 --> 29:45.440
I've been admitted.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.440
I was sent a red letter

29:49.440 --> 29:51.760
with a golden triangle on the front

29:51.760 --> 29:52.960
and inside it just said,

29:52.960 --> 29:54.720
you're in, here's the shirt.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.560
And now I belong to the Trunk Club.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.840
The power I wield is mind boggling.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.120
What's the Trunk Club, Travis?

30:01.120 --> 30:02.000
Oh, I'm glad you asked.

30:02.720 --> 30:03.760
Trunk Club is basically,

30:05.280 --> 30:07.040
you know how we have lots of questions

30:07.040 --> 30:08.160
about where people say like,

30:08.160 --> 30:09.520
I don't know what to wear.

30:09.520 --> 30:11.600
Imagine if you had a friend

30:11.600 --> 30:13.520
who knew what to wear

30:13.520 --> 30:14.320
and you could say,

30:14.320 --> 30:16.480
here's the kinds of things I go to,

30:16.480 --> 30:18.560
here's the kinds of clothes I like to wear

30:18.560 --> 30:20.480
and I have no idea where to get them

30:20.480 --> 30:21.680
or how clothes work.

30:21.680 --> 30:22.800
And then they came back to you

30:22.800 --> 30:23.280
and you're like,

30:23.280 --> 30:25.440
hey, here's like a thousand options

30:25.440 --> 30:26.400
that you'll really like.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.240
And you do in fact like all of them.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.200
The way it works,

30:29.200 --> 30:31.280
after you try on the stuff in your box,

30:31.280 --> 30:32.320
in your trunk,

30:32.320 --> 30:33.760
then you keep the stuff that you want

30:33.760 --> 30:34.560
and the rest of the stuff,

30:34.560 --> 30:35.760
you put it right back in the box

30:35.760 --> 30:36.560
and ship it back to them.

30:36.560 --> 30:37.760
Like no problem,

30:37.760 --> 30:38.400
no questions asked.

30:38.400 --> 30:38.960
And then they charge you

30:38.960 --> 30:39.920
for the stuff you keep.

30:39.920 --> 30:40.720
Trav, what do you,

30:40.720 --> 30:42.080
do you have any items in your,

30:42.080 --> 30:43.360
did you get your trunk yet?

30:43.360 --> 30:44.560
Can I tell you Justin?

30:44.560 --> 30:45.760
Here in Los Angeles,

30:45.760 --> 30:48.160
there is like a brick and mortar place

30:48.160 --> 30:50.560
that I went to and like,

30:50.560 --> 30:51.920
one, they had a pool table

30:51.920 --> 30:52.720
and an open bar.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.480
It was like the coolest shit.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.920
And two, Brooke said like,

30:55.920 --> 30:56.800
okay, what do you want?

30:56.800 --> 30:57.360
Okay, great.

30:57.360 --> 30:59.360
And came back with this rack of stuff

30:59.360 --> 31:01.440
and they were all club bangers.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.440
Like, and I got a pair of jeans.

31:04.160 --> 31:04.800
That's the,

31:04.800 --> 31:05.840
it's like the first time

31:05.840 --> 31:07.200
I've ever worn jeans.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.320
How's that butt look?

31:08.320 --> 31:09.280
It's so good.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.240
Like it's how jeans

31:10.240 --> 31:11.440
are supposed to feel.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.760
It's like the best feeling denim,

31:13.760 --> 31:14.800
the best fit I've ever had.

31:14.800 --> 31:15.600
Do you sleep in them?

31:16.400 --> 31:17.520
Griffin, can I tell you something?

31:17.520 --> 31:18.560
No joke, I could.

31:18.560 --> 31:20.400
No, no, but don't, but don't.

31:20.400 --> 31:23.280
They're so comfortable, Griffin.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.720
It's like I've always thought

31:24.720 --> 31:26.320
I was wearing jeans before,

31:26.320 --> 31:28.080
but then like I take the pill

31:28.080 --> 31:29.520
and I realized I've just been wearing

31:29.520 --> 31:30.640
barbed wire pants.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.280
I'm a big fan.

31:33.280 --> 31:34.000
I'm a big fan.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.040
How can I get on board?

31:35.040 --> 31:37.600
You can go to trunkclub.com slash my brother

31:38.560 --> 31:40.640
and you'll get set up with like

31:41.360 --> 31:42.960
your account and the recommendations

31:42.960 --> 31:43.520
and everything.

31:43.520 --> 31:44.640
But the personal stylist,

31:44.640 --> 31:45.760
like I was talking about,

31:45.760 --> 31:47.920
who like is a real person

31:47.920 --> 31:49.440
that will like really help you.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.040
It's not like it's an AI thing

31:51.040 --> 31:52.480
where you type in pants

31:52.480 --> 31:54.400
and it's just like, yes, pants here.

31:54.400 --> 31:55.680
Like it's a real ass person

31:55.680 --> 31:56.320
that will help you.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.840
It's not a subscription service.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.840
You only pay for the clothes that you want.

31:59.840 --> 32:01.840
No hidden charges, just great clothes.

32:01.840 --> 32:02.960
They'll style you for free

32:03.920 --> 32:05.920
plus free shipping both ways.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.680
You only pay for the clothes you keep.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.920
trunkclub.com slash my brother.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.480
And listen, if you're on the fence

32:12.480 --> 32:13.600
about any items,

32:13.600 --> 32:14.880
just tweet us a picture.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.080
No, we'll give you like a thumbs up

32:16.080 --> 32:16.800
or thumbs down.

32:16.800 --> 32:17.680
We're not styled.

32:17.680 --> 32:19.520
We are absolutely not styled.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.760
I turn to us with these questions.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.360
Travis is now he's in the club.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.200
I know how pants are supposed to fit.

32:25.920 --> 32:26.800
I want to tell you all about

32:26.800 --> 32:27.680
bowl and branch.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.440
It's B-O-L-L and branch.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.760
One important thing you can do

32:31.760 --> 32:33.200
to help ensure having a good day.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.920
That's getting the right amount of sleep.

32:35.920 --> 32:40.320
The night before I have been sleeping recently

32:40.320 --> 32:42.720
a lot better thanks to bowl and branch sheets

32:42.720 --> 32:46.400
that I have been using obsessively.

32:46.400 --> 32:47.600
If it's time to wash these

32:47.600 --> 32:49.440
usually I'll like circulate.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.640
You know, you wash one

32:50.640 --> 32:51.680
and then you put on the other one

32:51.680 --> 32:53.040
the clean ones that you have in the closet.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.840
I wash them and my bed just sits naked

32:55.840 --> 32:56.960
until those sheets are done

32:56.960 --> 32:58.400
because that's all I want to sleep on.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.400
They're some of the most comfortable sheets

33:00.400 --> 33:01.520
I've ever slept on

33:01.520 --> 33:03.440
and they're really nicely priced.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.880
You're paying for quality sheets

33:04.880 --> 33:06.240
not department store overhead.

33:06.240 --> 33:08.000
So you get really luxurious sheets.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.320
Luxurious, they're luxurious sheets

33:10.320 --> 33:12.160
for a couple hundred bucks.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.880
Go to online to bowl.

33:14.880 --> 33:18.960
That's B-O-L-L and branch.com

33:18.960 --> 33:21.520
and they'll let you try them risk-free for 30 nights.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.920
There's no way you're going to want to send them back.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.320

33:32.800 --> 33:34.160

33:35.600 --> 33:37.680

33:37.680 --> 33:39.200
Survival axes.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.720

33:53.440 --> 33:55.200
I want to apologize to bowl and branch

33:55.200 --> 33:57.040
for laughing through a lot of that message.

33:57.920 --> 34:00.800
It's not because I find the idea of high quality sheets

34:00.800 --> 34:04.720
and duvet covers sent to your door particularly funny.

34:04.720 --> 34:06.800
It's because I read ahead to this next message.

34:06.800 --> 34:07.920
If you want to get a message on the show

34:07.920 --> 34:09.120
for a friend or a small business

34:09.120 --> 34:11.040

34:11.040 --> 34:12.320
and we'll get you set up.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.080
But this message is for Eric

34:14.080 --> 34:16.000
and it's from Big Daddy Hoffman.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.160
And the entirety of the message is

34:18.720 --> 34:21.280
what is dickshoulders.biz?

34:22.480 --> 34:24.800
And I was laughing because I clicked through to it.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.080
Have you guys visited?

34:26.080 --> 34:27.040
Yes, I have.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.640
I'm visiting it.

34:28.640 --> 34:29.520
I'm there.

34:31.200 --> 34:33.840
This is the best website in the world.

34:33.840 --> 34:38.080
Dickshoulders.biz is maybe the best website.

34:39.760 --> 34:41.120
What is dickshoulders.biz?

34:41.120 --> 34:44.320
That's the whole message for Eric from Big Daddy Hoffman.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.760
And now you all have to live with this.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.080
This message is for Sarah.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.040
Fuck you.

34:49.040 --> 34:49.760
From Tim.

34:50.640 --> 34:53.280
Dear Sarah, happy anniversary.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.040
These last two years have been amazing

34:55.040 --> 34:58.080
and I feel closer to you and love you more than ever.

34:58.080 --> 35:01.200
I'm incredibly excited to spend the rest of my life with you.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.080
Love, Tim.

35:02.080 --> 35:04.480
P.S. I know our anniversary is October 5th,

35:04.480 --> 35:06.240
which is exactly why I had our brothers

35:06.800 --> 35:09.360
read this on February 22nd.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.560
I could not have fucked it up worse.

35:12.560 --> 35:14.240
We couldn't have fucked it up worse.

35:14.240 --> 35:15.040
Oofa doofa.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.160
Yeah, we almost got it.

35:16.160 --> 35:18.080
This is another one of those wonderful messages

35:18.080 --> 35:19.760
that's almost like the equinox.

35:19.760 --> 35:23.280
Like we almost split the uprights between the dates

35:23.280 --> 35:24.800
across two different years.

35:24.800 --> 35:27.200
Do you think every episode Tim would see it again

35:27.200 --> 35:28.720
and go like, honey, just listen.

35:28.720 --> 35:29.520
I think you'll...

35:29.520 --> 35:31.600
Oh, no, no, fuck, nope.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.100
Nevermind.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.760
And then it got enough months away

35:35.760 --> 35:37.520
where he was like, oh, I hope it's not now.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.720
It's gonna be worse than this.

35:38.720 --> 35:39.680
Now it's gonna be weird.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.000
But hey, happy anniversary, you two.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.400
You guys, I'm so excited to introduce to you

35:46.400 --> 35:49.280
my new baby, Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.040
This is gonna be a really fun look

35:51.040 --> 35:52.560
at things that I find curious,

35:52.560 --> 35:54.400
whether it's a menstrual cup,

35:54.400 --> 35:55.920
it might be the Romanov family,

35:55.920 --> 35:58.640
it might be fracking, it could be Carly Fiorina.

35:58.640 --> 35:59.360
I don't even know.

35:59.360 --> 35:59.920
Who knows?

35:59.920 --> 36:01.440
It's gonna be whatever I think is interesting.

36:01.440 --> 36:03.520
I can't wait to bring it to you guys.

36:03.520 --> 36:05.040
We're gonna be bringing in content experts.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.480
I'm gonna be learning the things.

36:06.480 --> 36:08.160
It's only gonna take about 30 minutes

36:08.160 --> 36:10.320
for you to expand your baby brains with me

36:10.320 --> 36:11.600
and have a super fun time.

36:11.600 --> 36:12.720
So I can't wait to see you

36:12.720 --> 36:14.560
on our first episode of Getting Curious.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.680
Hey, it's time for a Yahoo.

36:17.680 --> 36:18.000
I don't...

36:18.000 --> 36:18.720
Okay, fine.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.920
Everybody's doing Yahoo's now.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.200
I don't feel like it's like...

36:23.920 --> 36:26.560
It doesn't feel as special to me anymore.

36:26.560 --> 36:27.840
Yeah, but their Yahoo's are like,

36:27.840 --> 36:29.520
I put Piscetti up my butt

36:29.520 --> 36:32.320
and I'm a penguin.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.840
Like, fakey fake bullshit.

36:33.840 --> 36:34.560
I'm not into that.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.000
I'm into the real shit.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.200
Real shit slung to us by heroes like Level 9000,

36:39.200 --> 36:40.400
Yajur, Drew, Drew Davenport.

36:40.400 --> 36:40.960
Thank you, Drew.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.320
Hashtag real shit.

36:42.320 --> 36:43.200
Hashtag real shit.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.200
It's by Jamie who asks...

36:46.400 --> 36:48.400
I put Piscetti up my butt.

36:50.160 --> 36:50.960
That's what it said.

36:52.960 --> 36:57.200
Is Mark Hamill going to be able to do lightsaber fights

36:57.200 --> 36:59.360
in the next two movies of the Star Wars?

37:00.080 --> 37:03.280
I have just realized and looked on Wikipedia.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.120
He is 64 years old.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.760
Plus, I am thinking he will fight like an old man,

37:07.760 --> 37:10.320
like Obi-Wan Kenobi in Episode 4, A New Hope.

37:11.200 --> 37:14.080
Is Mark Hamill going to be too old to do the fights?

37:14.960 --> 37:15.360
No.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.760
Okay, first things first.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.280
Mark Hamill's 64 years old?

37:19.280 --> 37:20.560
Dude, he looks fucking great.

37:20.560 --> 37:21.680
Yeah, he looks really good.

37:21.680 --> 37:22.640
Looks really good.

37:22.640 --> 37:23.200
But does he look good enough?

37:23.200 --> 37:24.560
That beard is working for him.

37:24.560 --> 37:27.200
But can he flip and shit?

37:27.200 --> 37:27.520
You know what I mean?

37:27.520 --> 37:30.720
But he did it with Yoda and he was like 875.

37:32.720 --> 37:35.120
We're gonna have a CGI Mark Hamill.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.720
Oh my fuck, how awesome is that?

37:36.720 --> 37:38.320
Or just put him in a mech suit?

37:38.320 --> 37:40.000
Is that a thing that happens in Star Wars?

37:41.600 --> 37:43.440
I feel kind of bad for Mark Hamill

37:43.440 --> 37:45.040
when he found out that it was like,

37:45.040 --> 37:47.360
uh, we're doing this again, huh?

37:47.360 --> 37:48.480
Can't get back in it.

37:48.480 --> 37:50.400
Because like, I bet Mark Hamill was like,

37:51.360 --> 37:52.720
if that is coming up,

37:52.720 --> 37:57.120
you know that you like have to start getting carved.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.880
Like you have to start getting fit.

37:58.880 --> 38:00.480
How baller would that be?

38:00.480 --> 38:02.240
Start of episode like eight,

38:02.240 --> 38:03.760
he just like pulls back his throat

38:03.760 --> 38:05.920
and he's fucking ripped.

38:05.920 --> 38:08.800
Yeah, he's as jacked as Mark Hamill was

38:08.800 --> 38:10.160
in the original trilogy.

38:10.160 --> 38:11.120
No, more so.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.600
And it's just like, we haven't seen Luke in 20 years.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.760
It's just because he's been getting diesel.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.400
No, I'm making a joke at your two expense.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.600
Because I don't think there is a part

38:19.600 --> 38:21.440
in the original Star Wars where he ripped off his shirt

38:21.440 --> 38:24.000
and he had like a 13, a glistening 13 pack.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.120
Not in the original edit.

38:26.960 --> 38:30.400
In the fucking George Lucas wacky CGI special edition.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.000
It was like, oh my God.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.320
We take you live to Dagobah

38:36.320 --> 38:38.320
where I just found this image of Luke

38:38.320 --> 38:39.680
carrying Yoda on his back.

38:39.680 --> 38:40.720
And I gotta say, boys,

38:40.720 --> 38:42.240
those fish lifters are looking mighty tempted.

38:42.240 --> 38:42.880
Yeah, all right.

38:42.880 --> 38:44.400
That's fair, that's fair, that's fair.

38:44.400 --> 38:44.900
Deez!

38:45.440 --> 38:45.940
Deez!

38:46.960 --> 38:48.080
Rick Deez!

38:48.080 --> 38:49.280
Look at Rick Deez!

38:49.280 --> 38:50.640
Rick Deez.

38:50.640 --> 38:52.320
Rick Deez is the wee name.

38:52.320 --> 38:53.440
Get me Rick Deez.

38:53.440 --> 38:54.560
That's taken.

38:54.560 --> 38:55.280
Yeah, you know what?

38:55.280 --> 38:56.880
This picture just made me realize

38:56.880 --> 38:59.840
there was somebody whose face was right at Mark Hamill's butt

38:59.840 --> 39:01.280
with their hand up Yoda.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.520
Oh my God, you're right!

39:04.320 --> 39:05.280
You're right!

39:05.280 --> 39:07.200
If Yoda is on his back,

39:07.200 --> 39:11.600
there's somebody with his hand basically up Mark Hamill's ass.

39:12.960 --> 39:13.460
Yeah.

39:13.840 --> 39:15.360
Oh, that's very unpleasant.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.320
That's hugely unpleasant.

39:18.320 --> 39:20.000
Let's just call it like it is.

39:20.720 --> 39:28.000
That fight with Sir Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi

39:28.000 --> 39:30.400
in episode four is bullshit.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.920
It is two old men just touching their dicks together, basically.

39:34.560 --> 39:37.200
It is the worst, most boring fight ever.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.960
And then that's why I was so psyched in the new trilogy

39:40.960 --> 39:42.960
when they got crazy with the flips and stuff.

39:43.600 --> 39:46.400
They had the horn-headed man that had the two lightsabers

39:46.400 --> 39:48.720
and it got crazy up in there with the flips and stuff.

39:49.680 --> 39:50.640
That's what I want.

39:50.640 --> 39:54.000
I don't want two old men having a cane fight.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.800
I want to see some fucking action, some dynamic action.

39:56.800 --> 39:58.640
Some Diego Montoya shit.

39:58.640 --> 40:01.040
But you don't want to see grumpy old men in space.

40:01.040 --> 40:01.440
Right.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.480
But here's the thing.

40:02.480 --> 40:05.120
In this day and age, famous person...

40:05.120 --> 40:06.080
Yeah, that would be great.

40:06.080 --> 40:07.520
I just need to say real quick.

40:07.520 --> 40:10.480
I know that it's unlikely considering.

40:10.480 --> 40:17.280
But if we could get and stack back for grumpy old men in space.

40:17.280 --> 40:18.240
CGI.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.240
Just thinking about all the factors.

40:21.440 --> 40:22.880
It's difficult.

40:22.880 --> 40:23.920
It'd be a big get.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.520
I mean, it'd be a big get.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.760
But I would just really like to see that film.

40:27.760 --> 40:28.960
If we could see that film.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.960
Everyone, I think, in this day and age knows that

40:30.960 --> 40:36.800
like a celebrity like 64 is like normal person 30.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.000
Like I just saw...

40:38.000 --> 40:39.440
Okay, saw Deadpool, right?

40:39.440 --> 40:40.560
Ryan Reynolds.

40:40.560 --> 40:41.680
Totally ripped.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.120
71 years old.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.920
Think about the fact that like he looked exactly the same as he did

40:45.920 --> 40:47.520
in Two Guys a Girl on a Pizza Place.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.680
And that was fucking like 45 years ago.

40:49.680 --> 40:50.240
Yeah.

40:50.240 --> 40:55.040
And he still looks that he has not aged a moment.

40:56.400 --> 40:59.040
And it's like, okay, Mark Hamill might be 64,

40:59.040 --> 41:01.760
but I bet he still looks better than me.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.360
32 year old Travis McElroy.

41:03.360 --> 41:06.160
Two Guys a Girl on a Pizza Place was like pre 9-11.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.560
And that motherfucker looks the same.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.880
It looks exactly the fucking same.

41:10.880 --> 41:14.320
Rob Lowe looks actually has aged backwards.

41:14.320 --> 41:17.680
Rob Lowe is like Dorian Graying all over the place.

41:17.680 --> 41:18.960
Will Smith looks great.

41:18.960 --> 41:19.840
Will Smith looks great.

41:19.840 --> 41:21.200
This is what I'm saying.

41:21.200 --> 41:21.680
Yeah.

41:21.680 --> 41:26.960
Will Smith's like his face is like a reverse cut in a tree

41:26.960 --> 41:28.240
and have to count his rings.

41:28.240 --> 41:31.280
You cannot tell the age of anything by Will Smith's face.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.720
Like try cutting it in half.

41:32.720 --> 41:33.120
You can't.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.880
Try cutting his face in half and counting the rings.

41:34.880 --> 41:35.840
There's no rings.

41:35.840 --> 41:40.320
Recently, I've been invited to two, quote, passion parties.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.440
If you're unaware, this is a thing where women gather around

41:43.440 --> 41:46.720
and examine paraphernalia of the secular variety.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.280
It's where they watch-

41:47.280 --> 41:48.000
Wait, no, no.

41:48.000 --> 41:48.720
Not secular.

41:49.680 --> 41:52.720
It's where they watch Tyler Perry's The Passion TV special.

41:53.600 --> 41:58.000
By my female identifying family members and their co-workers.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.640
And it was just as awkward as I had envisioned it.

42:00.640 --> 42:01.760
Oh, you went?

42:01.760 --> 42:03.440
Mistake.

42:03.440 --> 42:06.160
You said you had been invited, but then you went.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.520
That's a whole other kettle of fish.

42:07.520 --> 42:08.640
That's a horse of a different color.

42:09.280 --> 42:10.720
My question to you all is this.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.400
Despite the popularity of such events,

42:12.400 --> 42:15.360
these rituals normal for relatives to be participating in?

42:15.360 --> 42:16.000
No.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.760
Personally, I consider myself a fairly well-adjusted individual

42:19.760 --> 42:23.280
that has no issue having these conversations with my close friends.

42:23.280 --> 42:26.880
Yet I'm immensely uncomfortable discussing my intimate life

42:26.880 --> 42:28.800
with my family in particular.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.240
And due to my research into this,

42:30.240 --> 42:33.200
I'm a bit concerned that I'm the weird one.

42:33.200 --> 42:36.640
And that's from Much Love Moby.

42:36.640 --> 42:38.480
Stand in your truth, stand in your bliss.

42:39.360 --> 42:40.560
Like chase your bliss.

42:40.560 --> 42:44.160
Whatever feels right, go for it.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.800
I don't think there's anything wrong with these parties.

42:48.800 --> 42:52.800
And the family thing wears me out a little bit.

42:52.800 --> 42:53.760
Like not the friend thing.

42:53.760 --> 42:55.760
Like going to one of these parties is like whatever.

42:55.760 --> 42:58.160
Could be a real hootenanny.

42:58.160 --> 42:59.680
I don't really understand the-

42:59.680 --> 43:02.080
I think the point of it is the awkwardness, right?

43:02.080 --> 43:04.160
Because it's not like you're going to be doing some like

43:04.160 --> 43:07.360
peer-reviewed research on different Bilbo's.

43:07.360 --> 43:09.120
Like I think you can get on Extreme Restraints

43:09.120 --> 43:14.560
and just look at the critical consensus on the Bilbo's

43:14.560 --> 43:15.840
and their special features.

43:15.840 --> 43:21.680
I don't know how much info gathering is happening at these parties.

43:22.320 --> 43:25.280
But then I think about if I was in a room with my two brothers

43:25.280 --> 43:26.880
and we were examining Bilbo's.

43:26.880 --> 43:29.120
And God forbid my dad was there.

43:29.120 --> 43:29.760
Oh no.

43:29.760 --> 43:33.600
And we were scoping some Bo's, then I would probably be

43:34.400 --> 43:36.080
hugely bummed out by that.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.960
But like if someone were to invite me, I would be like,

43:38.960 --> 43:42.400
oh man, that sounds super fun if that's your thing.

43:42.400 --> 43:45.440
It's like if someone invited me to any event

43:45.440 --> 43:49.280
that I don't particularly enjoy, I wouldn't go to it.

43:50.320 --> 43:50.880
You know?

43:50.880 --> 43:53.360
If somebody was like, come watch like soccer.

43:53.360 --> 43:54.400
I'd be like, no thanks.

43:55.040 --> 43:57.680
We try on this show to-

43:57.680 --> 43:59.920
And it's something that we weren't great at when we started

43:59.920 --> 44:00.800
and I think we all-

44:00.800 --> 44:03.360
One might say that we were fucking terrible at it.

44:03.360 --> 44:04.800
We were fucking terrible at it.

44:04.800 --> 44:08.160
We try on this show to be as like open-minded

44:08.160 --> 44:10.480
and open-hearted as possible.

44:11.120 --> 44:15.440
And we try, like we work really, really hard at it.

44:15.440 --> 44:19.600
But there is a part of that where at some point

44:19.600 --> 44:23.520
you do run into a wall within yourself

44:23.520 --> 44:26.880
where you say like, okay, this is my personal limit.

44:26.880 --> 44:28.080
And that's not a failing.

44:28.640 --> 44:31.280
But if someone says to me, Justin,

44:31.280 --> 44:34.560
do you want to go look at plastic dicks with your Aunt Dana?

44:34.560 --> 44:36.640
The answer is no, I don't.

44:36.640 --> 44:37.760
I don't want to do that.

44:37.760 --> 44:38.720
And I'm like allowed to say no.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.480
I don't like spicy food

44:40.480 --> 44:43.920
and I don't like looking at plastic dicks with my Aunt Dana.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.560
Like those are two things I just know about myself.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.640
Aunt Patty, that might be a hoot,

44:48.640 --> 44:50.960
but I still am going to politely decline.

44:50.960 --> 44:53.680
No, I don't want to look at plastic dicks with you,

44:53.680 --> 44:56.800
especially not if there's going to be spicy food.

44:56.800 --> 45:02.000
Please let me know what sort of canapes you're planning on.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.320
Those are just two things I know I don't like.

45:04.960 --> 45:07.040
Flavorful spicy, that's fine.

45:07.040 --> 45:10.160
But just heat for heat's sake and also plastic dicks.

45:10.160 --> 45:13.440
And big metal cocks, yeah, that's fine too.

45:13.440 --> 45:14.000
Definitely.

45:14.640 --> 45:15.280
We're going to have some-

45:15.280 --> 45:16.080
I don't mind that.

45:16.080 --> 45:17.200
I have a problem with plastic

45:17.200 --> 45:18.320
because it's bad for the environment.

45:18.320 --> 45:21.360
Do you know how long it takes for a plastic dick to break down

45:21.360 --> 45:24.000
if you like bury it in a landfill or something?

45:24.000 --> 45:26.080
You can't recycle plastic dicks for anything,

45:26.080 --> 45:29.040
but big metal dicks, you could turn that into a park bench.

45:29.040 --> 45:31.280
You could turn that into, I think, shopping bags.

45:31.280 --> 45:32.400
I haven't read the literature,

45:32.400 --> 45:34.240
but I know that it's a thing you could do.

45:34.240 --> 45:37.040
And also please don't make the food too spicy.

45:37.040 --> 45:37.600
I'll be there.

45:37.600 --> 45:40.160
How long it takes for a plastic dick to break down

45:40.160 --> 45:42.720
if you bury it in an anus,

45:42.720 --> 45:46.320
because listen, I'm in a pretty bad way over here.

45:46.320 --> 45:48.640
And if you could give me some sort of timeline.

45:48.640 --> 45:52.480
But a metal dick, a big metal hog.

45:52.480 --> 45:53.600
You could take like a hundred of those

45:53.600 --> 45:55.280
and make the Iron Throne from Game of Thrones,

45:55.280 --> 45:57.360
except crazier and way more hilarious.

45:57.360 --> 45:58.560
That sounds awesome.

45:59.600 --> 46:00.080
I want that.

46:00.080 --> 46:00.800
That sounds awesome.

46:00.800 --> 46:02.080
What if I, what if every,

46:02.080 --> 46:05.120
do you guys think if I started recording the podcast

46:06.160 --> 46:08.720
in the Guyron Throne, which is what I'd call it.

46:10.240 --> 46:11.280
Not the iron bone.

46:13.200 --> 46:13.600
Fuck.

46:13.600 --> 46:14.640
The Guyron bone?

46:14.640 --> 46:15.280
No, we're getting too silly.

46:15.280 --> 46:15.920
That's too much.

46:15.920 --> 46:19.520
Would you be able to tell the difference?

46:19.520 --> 46:20.880
Just sort of in my demeanor and my attitude.

46:20.880 --> 46:21.440
Yes.

46:21.440 --> 46:23.360
I think that you would naturally take on

46:24.000 --> 46:25.920
a certain gravitas that you don't get

46:25.920 --> 46:27.120
in just like an office chair.

46:28.480 --> 46:28.800
Okay.

46:28.800 --> 46:30.720
Justin's just linked to another image

46:30.720 --> 46:32.960
and I'm assuming it exists and it does.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.320
And wow, this is really good.

46:34.320 --> 46:35.680
Well, hold on.

46:39.120 --> 46:41.280
What we're looking at here is the crown.

46:41.280 --> 46:42.800
The exact thing that I've described.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.600
And, but it's sitting on it sort of lazily.

46:45.600 --> 46:46.320
Yeah.

46:46.320 --> 46:48.000
As if to say killed him.

46:49.040 --> 46:50.080
Is a giant hog.

46:50.080 --> 46:51.760
Anyway, thanks for that, Justin.

46:51.760 --> 46:54.400
We've got to get a visual component of this show.

46:54.960 --> 46:57.200
We've got, we've got, we've got to have some sort of.

46:57.920 --> 47:02.080
Now imagine instead of Yoda on Lou's back.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.280
It's a dick.

47:03.280 --> 47:07.120
Listen, we haven't been closed-minded in this, right?

47:07.120 --> 47:09.600
Like I think, I think shit like this

47:09.600 --> 47:11.520
could be really empowering and fun.

47:11.520 --> 47:12.640
But what I'm saying is like,

47:12.640 --> 47:16.320
like you shouldn't feel obligated to go

47:16.320 --> 47:18.320
because you don't want to seem closed-minded

47:18.320 --> 47:19.440
for not wanting to go.

47:19.440 --> 47:21.200
This idea that you're the weird one

47:21.200 --> 47:22.720
because you don't feel comfortable doing it.

47:22.720 --> 47:25.600
Like that don't, don't, that's like the worst

47:25.600 --> 47:27.840
possible thing you could do.

47:27.840 --> 47:30.800
Like you're actually in a, in like, in a broader sense.

47:30.800 --> 47:34.160
And I, and I know that you're, you know,

47:34.720 --> 47:36.720
I can tell from your question that you're trying

47:36.720 --> 47:38.720
really hard to, to be sort of like progressive

47:38.720 --> 47:39.600
and open-minded sexually.

47:39.600 --> 47:41.120
And I'm really into that.

47:41.120 --> 47:43.600
But part of that, like the biggest part of that

47:43.600 --> 47:47.120
from where I sit is the lack of judgment.

47:47.120 --> 47:50.080
And when you say like, am I the weird one?

47:50.800 --> 47:52.320
You're judging yourself.

47:52.320 --> 47:54.400
Like, because you just have a preference.

47:54.400 --> 47:55.280
Like you have a limit.

47:55.280 --> 47:57.120
You have a thing that you don't want.

47:57.120 --> 48:01.040
That's completely like, that is 100% within your right.

48:01.040 --> 48:02.960
And by saying that, that you're weird,

48:02.960 --> 48:04.800
like you're, you're putting that judgment on yourself.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.240
If you're not gonna apply it to other people,

48:06.240 --> 48:07.520
you shouldn't apply it to you either.

48:07.520 --> 48:08.720
It's just not your thing.

48:08.720 --> 48:09.760
That's the thing you gotta know.

48:09.760 --> 48:10.640
You gotta know yourself.

48:10.640 --> 48:12.240
It's weird. Know what you're into,

48:12.240 --> 48:14.560
know what your deal is, and then follow that.

48:15.440 --> 48:15.940
Yep.

48:16.560 --> 48:17.360
That's where I'm at.

48:17.360 --> 48:19.200
I feel like this has been a weirdly,

48:19.200 --> 48:21.680
you guys feel like this has been like an unusually helpful,

48:21.680 --> 48:24.160
like I'm feeling very, very like I'm really,

48:24.160 --> 48:26.320
I think we've really gotten help from people.

48:26.320 --> 48:28.960
Well, let's take five minutes just as a palette cleanser

48:28.960 --> 48:30.720
and knock out this Yahoo real quick.

48:30.720 --> 48:31.360
Hell yeah.

48:31.360 --> 48:32.880
From Yahoo, it was, it was sent in

48:32.880 --> 48:34.480
by game recognized game, Rachel Rosen.

48:34.480 --> 48:35.040
Thank you, Rachel.

48:35.040 --> 48:37.360
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Camille, who asks,

48:37.360 --> 48:40.880
any good nicknames to call drumming?

48:41.600 --> 48:45.360
Hey, hey, I need help finding something cool

48:45.360 --> 48:49.280
and preferably original to call drumming for my bios for X.

48:50.000 --> 48:50.500
What?

48:50.800 --> 48:51.300
What?

48:51.760 --> 48:52.260
What?

48:52.400 --> 48:52.900
What?

48:53.280 --> 48:54.640
Like for their X.

48:55.200 --> 48:55.700
I don't know.

48:57.520 --> 48:59.280
Something original called drumming for my bios.

48:59.280 --> 49:03.520
Skin pounder, tub banger, stick thrower slash crosser.

49:03.520 --> 49:04.080
Ya feel?

49:04.640 --> 49:07.120
All of those could be names of dildos.

49:07.120 --> 49:08.800
Stick skin pounder, yes.

49:08.800 --> 49:10.320
Tub banger, absolutely.

49:10.320 --> 49:11.920
Stick thrower slash crosser.

49:12.560 --> 49:14.800
The least of the three, but yes, still good.

49:14.800 --> 49:15.300
Ya feel?

49:15.840 --> 49:16.880
Oh, I feel.

49:17.440 --> 49:18.320
Anything helps.

49:18.320 --> 49:20.240
So just leave anything you've been called,

49:20.240 --> 49:21.440
heard or made up, please.

49:21.440 --> 49:22.240
Thank you.

49:22.240 --> 49:25.040
So we're supposed to believe that we exist in a world

49:25.040 --> 49:27.200
in which just saying drumming isn't cool?

49:28.800 --> 49:29.120
Right.

49:29.120 --> 49:30.320
You need something sexy.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.960
You know, like they call guitar players like shredders

49:34.080 --> 49:36.000
or master splinters.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.040
They call bassists like strang-slippers

49:39.040 --> 49:42.160
and then they call singers throat pusher.

49:42.160 --> 49:45.440
Throat, throat, throat, throat notes.

49:46.160 --> 49:50.720
What if, what if, what if you were just like beat punisher?

49:50.720 --> 49:52.160
That sounds a little extreme for me

49:52.160 --> 49:53.440
because like what if they're just like a,

49:53.440 --> 49:57.760
you know, sort of a pop rock sort of outfit.

49:57.760 --> 49:58.260
Nice.

49:59.760 --> 50:00.720
Symbol tickler.

50:01.760 --> 50:02.400
That's not bad.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.080
Symbol tickler, that's pretty good.

50:04.080 --> 50:04.960
I like that.

50:04.960 --> 50:07.920
But I feel like pianists have like tickler like on lock.

50:07.920 --> 50:09.200
Like nobody else can be a tickler.

50:09.200 --> 50:10.240
They are the ticklers.

50:10.240 --> 50:11.200
Master of beats.

50:12.480 --> 50:14.720
That's a little wordy, I think.

50:14.720 --> 50:17.680
I tend to lean towards the grandiose because I believe

50:17.680 --> 50:22.640
and you know, I know that my musical feelings are strong

50:22.640 --> 50:24.080
and some people don't feel this strong,

50:24.080 --> 50:27.840
but I believe that the drummer is the heartbeat of the band.

50:29.200 --> 50:29.600
I know.

50:29.600 --> 50:31.440
I feel like the drummer sets the time.

50:31.440 --> 50:33.680
Yeah, and I feel like that's important.

50:33.680 --> 50:35.040
I don't know much about music,

50:35.040 --> 50:37.600
but the little bit I do know, I feel very strongly about.

50:39.280 --> 50:40.240
I am Spartacus.

50:41.360 --> 50:42.160
I led you here.

50:43.760 --> 50:46.080
Spartacus is the name of my favorite drummer

50:46.080 --> 50:48.720
from the film That Thing You Do.

50:48.720 --> 50:50.800
What about Bop Bop Boys?

50:51.840 --> 50:52.480
One more time.

50:54.560 --> 50:57.600
What about Bop Bop Boys?

50:58.640 --> 50:59.520
I like it.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.200
Can we just call them?

51:03.200 --> 51:07.360
And if you're a woman playing, Gone Girls.

51:08.240 --> 51:09.360
I like that too.

51:09.360 --> 51:11.280
Except it sounds a little bit like Gone Girl.

51:12.320 --> 51:15.920
That's a fucking great pun that I'd like cooked up,

51:15.920 --> 51:18.800
but that's like a terrifying thing that you wouldn't want to be.

51:19.360 --> 51:22.000
I'm looking forward to you identifying other puns as they come up.

51:23.600 --> 51:24.560
But what I'm saying is like,

51:24.560 --> 51:27.520
I don't know that anyone wants to be identified as a Gone Girl.

51:27.520 --> 51:28.720
Taplads.

51:28.720 --> 51:30.400
Taplads is good too.

51:31.920 --> 51:32.960
Beat machines.

51:32.960 --> 51:34.160
No, drum machines.

51:34.160 --> 51:36.240
Okay, no, fucking stop and think about it.

51:36.800 --> 51:39.920
Please think, drum machine is a thing.

51:39.920 --> 51:41.920
Oh, well, here's the thing, Griffin.

51:41.920 --> 51:42.880
You can think all you want to,

51:42.880 --> 51:44.400
but the one thing I know about music,

51:44.400 --> 51:46.560
it's not about thinking, it's about feeling, damn it.

51:46.560 --> 51:49.600
Especially the drums, which is all about,

51:49.600 --> 51:51.760
have you fucking seen Whiplash?

51:51.760 --> 51:53.280
It's not about thinking.

51:53.280 --> 51:54.720
You should just be a whiplash.

51:54.720 --> 51:57.120
How about we're all just whiplashes from now on?

51:57.120 --> 51:58.880
What about Conker Kings?

51:59.760 --> 52:01.520
Justin's the best at this.

52:01.520 --> 52:03.600
What about Cuban Pete?

52:03.600 --> 52:05.680
That's not a, Travis, let's just take a backseat

52:05.680 --> 52:06.720
and just let Justin go.

52:06.720 --> 52:09.200
Okay, what about Bongo Bears?

52:09.760 --> 52:10.240
Pretty good.

52:11.600 --> 52:12.480
Give me three more.

52:13.440 --> 52:15.040
Okay, Jim Bay Jim.

52:16.400 --> 52:18.240
Are you, okay, nope, stop.

52:18.240 --> 52:19.040
Okay.

52:19.040 --> 52:22.640
Do you have a Wikipedia page open called different drums?

52:22.640 --> 52:24.000
No, I'm just thinking of different-

52:24.000 --> 52:25.600
The different drums that there are.

52:25.600 --> 52:27.440
Fuck it, boys.

52:27.440 --> 52:28.400
Snare Bears.

52:28.400 --> 52:30.400
Snare Bears.

52:30.400 --> 52:32.320
Back in the game, on the scoreboard.

52:32.880 --> 52:33.520
Bass Bass.

52:34.320 --> 52:36.240
Like a what?

52:36.240 --> 52:38.400
Like a bitch playing drums?

52:38.400 --> 52:40.720
It's great because it also works as bass bass.

52:40.720 --> 52:42.480
What about cymbal tickler?

52:42.480 --> 52:43.760
You said that.

52:43.760 --> 52:44.240
What?

52:44.240 --> 52:46.240
What about Jim Bay Jim?

52:46.880 --> 52:48.000
I like that, Griffin.

52:48.640 --> 52:51.040
I'm having an episode.

52:51.040 --> 52:56.560
How about Rhythm Robbie?

52:56.560 --> 52:59.280
Well, that's specific.

52:59.280 --> 53:03.200
I think we're naming like musical garbage pail kids for the most part.

53:05.200 --> 53:06.640
Can we call it blue manning?

53:10.400 --> 53:14.240
Can we call the act of hitting one thing with another thing?

53:14.240 --> 53:17.440
You could be like shaping a sword with a hammer

53:17.440 --> 53:19.360
and we would call that blue manning.

53:19.360 --> 53:20.720
Stomp without the trash cans.

53:21.600 --> 53:22.880
Or stomp with the trash cans.

53:22.880 --> 53:24.640
That would also fit.

53:25.280 --> 53:26.000
That's not drumming.

53:26.000 --> 53:26.880
That's just noise.

53:26.880 --> 53:28.400
What are they doing over there?

53:28.400 --> 53:29.120
Stomp.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.720
Sure, I'm glad somebody's taking them to task.

53:31.280 --> 53:31.920
Yeah.

53:31.920 --> 53:32.800
What's up, Stomp?

53:32.800 --> 53:33.520
Come at me.

53:33.520 --> 53:34.800
What about drum haters?

53:35.680 --> 53:37.520
What do we call people who hate drummers?

53:37.520 --> 53:38.080
No, no, no.

53:38.080 --> 53:40.960
Because if you think about it, what you're really doing as a drummer

53:40.960 --> 53:42.960
is just like hitting drums.

53:42.960 --> 53:44.000
Drum fighters.

53:44.000 --> 53:44.880
Drum fighters.

53:46.560 --> 53:50.560
What do you do in, what do you play for Coldplay?

53:50.560 --> 53:52.000
Oh, I'm the drum fighter.

53:52.000 --> 53:52.640
What do you mean?

53:52.640 --> 53:56.320
Well, the drum, if you don't keep it, you know, beaten back,

53:56.320 --> 53:58.720
will just attack and kill Chris Martin.

53:58.720 --> 54:02.400
So I have to like constantly sort of keep it in its place.

54:02.400 --> 54:05.600
I think it's probably the hardest to, as a drummer,

54:05.600 --> 54:08.800
like it's the hardest instrument to convince people

54:08.800 --> 54:11.280
that they need to be careful when they're carrying your stuff.

54:11.280 --> 54:11.680
Yeah.

54:11.680 --> 54:13.600
Because if they drop it, you're like, hey, hey, hey, hey.

54:14.240 --> 54:15.840
And they say, well, you're, I mean,

54:15.840 --> 54:17.120
you're just going to hit it later, right?

54:18.720 --> 54:20.320
I'm just going to hit it with sticks later.

54:20.320 --> 54:23.840
I don't see how I'm going to be in any worse, you know,

54:23.840 --> 54:25.120
I don't see how that's any worse.

54:25.120 --> 54:28.080
Technically, by dropping that snare down that flight of stairs,

54:28.080 --> 54:29.760
I played the drums.

54:29.760 --> 54:31.680
I guess I'm drumming, I guess I'm a drummer now.

54:32.240 --> 54:34.400
I guess now I'm the Jimba Jim.

54:36.080 --> 54:38.800
Now who's the skin pounder is what I want to know.

54:39.520 --> 54:41.040
That's going to do it for us, folks.

54:41.040 --> 54:45.280
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

54:45.280 --> 54:46.480
We hope you had a lot of fun.

54:47.600 --> 54:48.720
Super quick stuff.

54:48.720 --> 54:51.520
McElroy shows, you can find a bunch of our shows there.

54:54.400 --> 54:58.000
We've got, let's see, I want to try to keep these shorter.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.120
Yeah, real fast.

54:59.120 --> 55:02.320
We got, we got Rose Buddies is a new show

55:02.320 --> 55:03.760
I do with my wife about The Bachelor.

55:04.480 --> 55:06.800
I got a new video game podcast called Cool Games Inc.

55:06.800 --> 55:09.360
I just started one called Interrobang with Travis and Tybee

55:09.360 --> 55:11.280
where me and my friend Tybee go on rants

55:11.280 --> 55:13.520
that take us through whining conversations.

55:13.520 --> 55:15.280
Do one called Schmanners with my wife

55:15.280 --> 55:16.960
where we talk about etiquette.

55:16.960 --> 55:20.160
And we just moved trends like these over to Max Fun.

55:20.160 --> 55:21.440
So that's very exciting.

55:21.440 --> 55:23.280
I do a show called Sawbones with my wife.

55:23.280 --> 55:24.800
It's a medical history show.

55:24.800 --> 55:25.920
If you haven't listened to it,

55:25.920 --> 55:28.240
our most recent episode was about heartburn

55:28.240 --> 55:30.160
and like why you get heartburn.

55:30.160 --> 55:32.800
How we've tried to treat it, it was very informative.

55:32.800 --> 55:36.160
I thought you can find that on iTunes or McElroy shows.com.

55:36.160 --> 55:36.800
They're all there.

55:37.600 --> 55:39.120
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

55:39.120 --> 55:39.920
for the use of our theme song

55:39.920 --> 55:42.000
as a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.680
You can find it on iTunes.

55:43.680 --> 55:44.320
You can find it on Amazon.

55:44.320 --> 55:45.680
You can find it anywhere where music's sold

55:45.680 --> 55:46.880
and it's very, very good.

55:46.880 --> 55:48.400
It's a terrific, terrific album.

55:48.400 --> 55:49.520
And John's a good guy.

55:49.520 --> 55:51.520

Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us to think about?

56:11.360 --> 56:11.760
I sure do.

56:11.760 --> 56:13.440
This one was sent in by Brooks Oglesby.

56:13.440 --> 56:13.920
Thank you, Brooks.

56:13.920 --> 56:15.840
It's by Yahoo Answers users.

56:15.840 --> 56:16.800
Something's gone wrong.

56:16.800 --> 56:17.600
Call him Dave.

56:18.320 --> 56:22.800
Dave asks, did the moon exist in the 90s?

56:22.800 --> 56:23.840
I hate the moon.

56:29.840 --> 56:31.200
My name is Justin McElroy.

56:31.200 --> 56:32.080
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:33.040 --> 56:34.240
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

56:34.240 --> 56:35.200
Kiss your dad.

56:35.200 --> 56:44.800
Square the lips.

57:05.440 --> 57:07.120
We welcome a kick-ass lady guest.

57:07.120 --> 57:08.880
We talk about our lives, our dreams,

57:08.880 --> 57:11.200
and the terrible decisions we've made that still haunt us.

57:11.840 --> 57:15.280
We've had on great comedians like Aisha Tyler and Margaret Trough,

57:15.280 --> 57:17.280
plus screenwriters, doctors, authors, you know,

57:17.280 --> 57:19.440
anyone who's willing to be as open as we are.

57:19.440 --> 57:20.400
It's all a lot of fun.

57:20.400 --> 57:21.920
That's us, Lady to Lady.

57:21.920 --> 57:22.960
Can you keep a secret?

57:22.960 --> 57:38.960
Neither.
