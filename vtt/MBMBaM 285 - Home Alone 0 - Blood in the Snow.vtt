00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:52.320
Hello, hello everybody, and welcome to Don't Eat That Mary, a Great British Bake Off fancast.

00:52.320 --> 00:57.120
I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

00:57.120 --> 01:03.840
And I'm Pimbles. And I'm Pimbles, the bread man.

01:05.040 --> 01:09.200
This is our pet, Pimbles the bread man, a man made of bread.

01:09.200 --> 01:13.360
Boy, that's me. They left me in the proving oven too long, didn't they?

01:13.360 --> 01:16.480
I sprouted legs and arms and I became a real man,

01:16.480 --> 01:20.720
but only instead of where my skin would be, it's all crusty bread, isn't it?

01:22.880 --> 01:26.240
Don't be afraid of Pimbles, child. Don't be afraid of me, but also don't eat me.

01:26.240 --> 01:29.360
Don't become too friendly, child, and try to put your mouth around Pimbles.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.280
Don't get too comfy with Pimbles, eh?

01:34.720 --> 01:36.960
He'll also steal your identity.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.880
What do we do, little one? What do we do? We look. We don't touch, that's right.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.160
Don't touch Pimbles.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.480
Don't touch Pimbles. He's made of crusty bread.

01:44.480 --> 01:45.680
And he's got leprosy.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.600
Well, everything made of bread has leprosy, if you think about it.

01:51.280 --> 01:54.400
It's not leprosy, it's caraway seed, isn't it?

01:54.400 --> 01:56.240
It just fall off when he walks around, don't it?

01:56.240 --> 01:58.800
Oh, Lord, the bread comes off with the boot, doesn't it, Pimbles?

01:58.800 --> 02:00.320
But don't be afraid, children.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.280
Pimbles' pieces gonna fall off from time to time, but that's just life.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.200
You'll learn, you'll learn.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.640
Little bit of hummus.

02:06.640 --> 02:10.400
Oh, don't eat that. Oh, Mary, don't eat that. Don't eat Pimbles, Mary.

02:10.400 --> 02:10.880
It's raw.

02:11.680 --> 02:14.800
That's raw inside, isn't it? Pimbles didn't have a great cook job, did he?

02:14.800 --> 02:16.080
It's not a good bake.

02:16.080 --> 02:17.440
Pimbles got a little too thick in the middle, didn't he?

02:17.440 --> 02:18.800
He's got a soggy bottom.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.840
Overproven.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.200
He's got a soggy bottom, doesn't he?

02:21.200 --> 02:23.600
Oh, Mary.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.040
Mary.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.640
Mary, don't eat that.

02:30.640 --> 02:31.440
Mary.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.000
Mary.

02:32.000 --> 02:32.960
Bad Mary.

02:32.960 --> 02:33.840
No, Mary.

02:33.840 --> 02:34.480
Down, Mary.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.200
Don't make me get the spray.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.880
I'll get the no-no can, Mary. You know I will.

02:38.880 --> 02:39.840
I'll get the no-no can.

02:39.840 --> 02:40.960
Mary.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.000
Mary, don't eat it.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.320
That's grass, Mary.

02:44.880 --> 02:45.920
Mary, put the grass.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.760
Mary, that's a fork. Don't eat that.

02:47.760 --> 02:51.760
Mary, it's a pile of grass on a fork, Mary.

02:51.760 --> 02:52.960
Don't eat Sue, Mary.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.080
Mary.

02:54.720 --> 02:55.440
You cannibal.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.280
Mary, you're gnawing on my elbow.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.880
You're having a little gnaw, aren't you?

03:00.880 --> 03:01.520
Mary, down.

03:02.480 --> 03:04.400
I've been having a hard time thinking of what would be,

03:04.960 --> 03:06.880
how we could improve The Great British Breaking Show,

03:06.880 --> 03:09.120
because I think it's, like, pretty much perfect.

03:09.920 --> 03:15.200
But I do like the idea of Pimbles the bread boy, the bread man.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.120
Like, it needs a mascot. It needs attitude.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.040
They need more merch possibilities.

03:19.040 --> 03:24.160
Right, you need a, like, an unleavened mascot in there.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.200
Like a bready, a starchy gex, if you will.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.640
Oh, that's great, because you could have, like,

03:28.640 --> 03:29.920
you know, your Pimbles figure,

03:29.920 --> 03:32.560
and then you could also have, like, battle damage Pimbles,

03:32.560 --> 03:36.480
and, like, you know, your, like, in armor Pimbles.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.240
I mean, the whole thing is merch for adults,

03:38.240 --> 03:39.840
because it's like, oh, I gotta get that rolling pin.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.240
I gotta get Mary's special proving gloves,

03:42.240 --> 03:45.120
which are, of course, the fighting gloves she uses

03:45.120 --> 03:47.120
in The Great British Proving Ground,

03:47.120 --> 03:48.400
which is where they make you fight.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.440
It's a different show.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.280
The Great British Proving Draw BBO after hours.

03:53.280 --> 03:54.880
Right, but the kids watch the show,

03:54.880 --> 03:56.320
and they don't get a whole lot out of it.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.360
Let's get Pimbles in the mix.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.360
Oi, Casey's made Pimbles, isn't it?

03:59.360 --> 04:00.960
And it can be, like, elf on the shelf,

04:00.960 --> 04:03.360
except it's, like, bread in the box.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.920
He knows if you don't let the bread rise long enough.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.440
And also, if you touch him, he dies.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.000
Mm-hmm, because he's so flaky.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.240
Mm-hmm, because he's so flaky.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.160
I'm bite of crusty bread, ain't I?

04:14.160 --> 04:14.960
Bread and crackers.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.920
I like The Great British Bake Off,

04:17.920 --> 04:20.000
but there's been, I do have,

04:20.000 --> 04:21.840
I think British people are too nice

04:21.840 --> 04:23.520
to have their own cooking show.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.240
Like, they don't give anybody actual criticism.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.720
If somebody burns their shit, they're like,

04:28.720 --> 04:32.240
well, I think you let this bake go on just a bit too long.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.160
Like, they burnt their shit, Mary.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.000
It's on fire, it's still on fire.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.520
They don't even eliminate people.

04:37.520 --> 04:38.800
When they get rid of them,

04:38.800 --> 04:40.560
you can still see them in the corners.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.640
They're just standing back there watching other people.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.000
They're letting them bake still.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.880
They just politely asked them not to come back next week,

04:46.880 --> 04:48.240
but it's really up to them.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.800
Oh, love, I'm sorry, but this flamencoosh had a gun in it.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.440
I took a big bite of your flamencoosh

04:53.440 --> 04:54.960
and I bit into a gun.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.360
Oh, your Queen of Mall is full of pebbles.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.280
I'm so sorry, but you can't service

04:59.280 --> 05:01.440
all of your muffins in a garbage can.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.200
We expected them in a muffin tin, didn't we?

05:04.720 --> 05:05.920
Pimples show at the door.

05:05.920 --> 05:06.720
This way!

05:06.720 --> 05:09.040
But I like the plate.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.360
It was a very playful presentation, the garbage can.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.880
The garbage can has a great bake.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.360
It's a great bake on the can.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.760
Great, great proving on the tin, I'd say.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.600
Also, hey, British people,

05:19.600 --> 05:22.960
you guys are putting some things in bread, huh?

05:22.960 --> 05:23.200
Yeah.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.600
You all are putting some things in there.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.720
You know what we put in bread?

05:27.680 --> 05:28.720
Bread, for the most part.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.000
Sometimes soup is predictable.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.880
Sometimes?

05:30.880 --> 05:32.640
If we get real crazy, we'll put like a soup.

05:33.920 --> 05:34.880
Sometimes?

05:34.880 --> 05:37.760
I guess every time I watch Great British Bake Off,

05:37.760 --> 05:41.040
I want just one time 11 of the contestants

05:41.040 --> 05:42.960
to get like, you know, all their ingredients out.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.840
I'm like one guy just to pull out like a box of like,

05:45.840 --> 05:49.840
you know, the ready-made like Pillsbury, you know, cake mix.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.480
And he's just like looking around as he dumps it into a bowl

05:52.480 --> 05:53.760
with some water and stirs it up.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.160
And he's like, I don't think I'm supposed to be here.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.640
I feel way off.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.360
I wish you would let me finish my exploration of things

06:01.360 --> 06:03.680
that British people are putting in bread these days.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.520
What else do people put in bread, Justin?

06:05.520 --> 06:06.800
It was olives and stuff.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.080
Olives?

06:08.960 --> 06:09.440
In bread?

06:10.320 --> 06:12.560
Everything goes in their bread.

06:12.560 --> 06:13.200
Yeah, that's true.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.720
I saw somebody make a loaf of bread

06:14.720 --> 06:16.640
and then stuff it inside another loaf of bread.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.840
It's like, and then there was like, they put a G.I. Joe in there.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.760
It's like, it's a tea loaf, isn't it?

06:21.760 --> 06:23.120
Like, no, it's what?

06:23.120 --> 06:24.640
You put a G.I. Joe in there.

06:24.640 --> 06:25.600
If they cut open the bread

06:25.600 --> 06:27.760
and they find memories from their childhood.

06:27.760 --> 06:28.160
Yeah.

06:28.160 --> 06:28.400
What?

06:28.960 --> 06:29.920
How did you do this?

06:29.920 --> 06:32.640
There's just baubles full of my dreams.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.280
I'm pretty sure British G.I. Joes were called Union Jacks

06:36.320 --> 06:36.960
back in the day.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.360
I don't see what's so great about baking

06:39.360 --> 06:40.560
that it deserves its own show

06:40.560 --> 06:43.120
because that's all they do on that fucking television program.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.240
If we can even call it that,

06:44.240 --> 06:45.920
basically it's radio with pictures

06:45.920 --> 06:47.120
is about how thrilling it is.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.280
It's like a graphic novel.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.000
Yes, basically, except the pictures move.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.920
But what I want is other forms of cooking,

06:56.880 --> 06:59.520
like the super cool British frying challenge.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.760
And that show would basically just be called Chips.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.520
Chips.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.560
And this is Chippy.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.320
He's a boy made of chips.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.080
We done made chips again, didn't we love?

07:11.280 --> 07:12.080
For this challenge,

07:12.080 --> 07:13.760
Mary would like you to make some chips.

07:13.760 --> 07:14.880
I just like chips.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.360
Here's the worst part, right?

07:19.360 --> 07:21.040
You would never guess this about me.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.560
I don't know how to make them.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.680
My name is Barry Barry.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.600
I have no idea how to make chips.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.240
I just know that at one point they're potatoes

07:30.240 --> 07:32.160
and another point, they're chips.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.600
What the fuck, right?

07:33.600 --> 07:34.400
I tried to bake.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.920
I'm fucking losing my shit.

07:37.120 --> 07:41.920
I put potatoes in the oven.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.400
I cut them real thin, didn't I?

07:44.400 --> 07:45.600
I left them in the oven.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.240
I waited, nothing, no chips.

07:48.240 --> 07:50.160
There's no point, they were chips.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.240
I'll be down for you and turning the bread in there.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.160
It's like, I can't not cook bread.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.560
I think I've done accents from every part

07:56.560 --> 07:58.400
of those beautiful aisles at this point.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.320
I think I've done a bit of Welsh.

08:00.320 --> 08:03.360
I think I've done a little bit of dirty Welsh.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.040
Dirty Welsh.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.920
Let's do some advice, what do you say boys?

08:07.920 --> 08:09.440
Here's our first question.

08:09.440 --> 08:13.520
If you have one, you can send it to mbnbam at maximumfun.org.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.240
Here we go.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.240
It's so weird that you just gave out the email

08:16.240 --> 08:18.800
because I don't think we've done that in like 100 episodes.

08:18.800 --> 08:19.920
It's really weird, right?

08:19.920 --> 08:21.120
People keep finding it though.

08:21.120 --> 08:21.680
I mean, shit.

08:21.680 --> 08:24.480
I don't work on Fridays.

08:24.480 --> 08:28.240
Okay, so occasionally, I will go see a movie on my day off

08:28.240 --> 08:29.600
in order to beat the crowds

08:29.600 --> 08:31.680
who would normally come on a Friday evening.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.200
This past time, I was sitting in a relatively empty theater

08:35.200 --> 08:39.040
when a man who smelled horribly plopped down next to me.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.520
Since the odor would be a distraction during the film,

08:42.080 --> 08:44.880
I knew I had to switch seats, but I wanted to do it in a way

08:44.880 --> 08:46.640
the man didn't think it was because of him.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.400
I ended up getting up,

08:48.400 --> 08:52.640
taking off all of my stuff, walking out of the theater,

08:53.440 --> 08:56.880
counting to 10, re-entering the theater,

08:57.440 --> 08:59.200
and sitting on the same row as the guy,

09:00.240 --> 09:02.560
hoping he just thought that I was unaware

09:02.560 --> 09:04.640
of my original seat was actually closer to him.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.960
Did I make the right move?

09:07.440 --> 09:08.480
Could I have done it better?

09:09.440 --> 09:11.840
That's from Movie Seat Mover in Macon.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.480
Why did you sit in the same row?

09:14.480 --> 09:15.600
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.280
Why did you sit in the same row? Yeah, that's a great question.

09:20.080 --> 09:21.760
Did I do the right thing?

09:21.760 --> 09:24.800
And like the least stealth approach to this thing?

09:25.760 --> 09:28.000
No, he's gonna notice that you're two seats away from him

09:28.000 --> 09:29.360
and not one seat away from him.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.440
What he wouldn't notice is that if you came in

09:31.440 --> 09:32.480
and sat three rows behind him,

09:32.480 --> 09:34.000
he would think you are a different person

09:34.000 --> 09:37.280
because while we do develop like better object permanence

09:37.280 --> 09:38.960
as we go, it's not that good.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.200
They're paying attention to like the fucking locale

09:41.200 --> 09:43.360
of every single human being around us.

09:43.360 --> 09:46.240
But this is one of those things that's so indicative

09:46.240 --> 09:48.000
of like people being afraid

09:48.000 --> 09:50.560
that everyone's also thinking about them

09:50.560 --> 09:51.680
as much as you're thinking about them.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.360
They're not, absolutely.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.040
You just get up and move.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.760
That dude isn't gonna think twice about it.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.120
Can you imagine a reality

09:59.120 --> 10:00.400
at which you sit through his back

10:00.400 --> 10:02.560
and that dude's like, up, up, up, up, up.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.040
Excuse me, I don't think so.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.560
I believe you were next to me.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.520
We were going to be movie buddies.

10:09.520 --> 10:13.680
Even if this fool like did notice,

10:13.680 --> 10:15.280
A, did notice,

10:15.280 --> 10:18.640
B, definitely, definitely took offense,

10:18.640 --> 10:23.360
C, definitely fully knew it was because he did not smell good.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.440
Even if all those things were true,

10:25.440 --> 10:28.480
he is never going to like say to you,

10:28.480 --> 10:31.360
like, excuse me, can we confront this together?

10:31.360 --> 10:32.080
Can we like, please?

10:32.080 --> 10:33.920
Let's just lay all the cards on the table here, man.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.360
Yeah, can we hit this head on, please?

10:35.360 --> 10:37.440
We've been dancing around this all movie.

10:37.440 --> 10:41.040
Me and my boys, Johnny and Justin,

10:41.040 --> 10:43.600
we went and saw The Hateful Eight earlier this week.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.520
And we saw it at the draft house,

10:45.520 --> 10:47.040
which has a signed seating,

10:47.040 --> 10:49.840
which is amazing for like any number of reasons.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.960
But these dudes were sitting in our seats.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.400
And it's like, that's the least perfect crime.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.160
It's the worst imaginable crime.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.440
Cause I have a little piece of paper here

10:59.440 --> 11:01.200
with numbers on it that says you're in my seats.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.440
And they were like, no, we're pretty sure this is right.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.280
I said, my boy Justin Tattle, didn't he?

11:05.280 --> 11:06.800
He went down the airship and was like,

11:06.800 --> 11:08.480
you need to get these guys out of here.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.760
Cause those are our seats.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.840
They're trying to make us sit in the back corner.

11:11.840 --> 11:16.000
And like, I'm a, listen, I'm an excitable P-boy.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.440
And I was seeing a Tarantino flake.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.200
So you know my bladder is gonna be a trembling

11:19.200 --> 11:22.000
the whole time out of just the pure tension of the work.

11:23.360 --> 11:24.240
And then they moved.

11:24.240 --> 11:25.920
And I think they said something gruff about it.

11:25.920 --> 11:26.560
But you know what?

11:26.560 --> 11:27.840
But they were wrong.

11:27.840 --> 11:28.480
They were wrong.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.600
Yeah, I'm not gonna feel bad.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.200
Mad props to my boy Justin for tattling.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.040
I'm too afraid to tattle most of the time.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.520
That's upsetting because I love tattling.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.680
It's so rare you get to as an adult.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.400
But isn't it like, okay, the unspoken rule is this.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.920
Just in case anyone was wondering.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.360
If you get, like, I've done this.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.360
I've sat in a movie theater where it was assigned seats.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.600
And it was like, ooh, I like that seat better.

11:50.880 --> 11:54.400
But, but, but, but, but the unspoken rule is this, Griffin.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.480
As soon as someone walks up and goes,

11:56.480 --> 11:59.440
I think you're in my seat, you go, oh, sorry.

11:59.440 --> 12:00.640
I read the ticket wrong.

12:00.640 --> 12:01.440
Oh man, sorry.

12:01.440 --> 12:04.080
I guess I confused a two with a 14.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.000
Like, really, you confused a two with a 14?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.600
But everyone accepts what's going on.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.160
Like, they know that you tried to sit in their seat

12:10.160 --> 12:11.520
because you like that seat better.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.560
But like, you have to move as soon as you're confronted about it.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.560
They're already embarrassed, but they thought,

12:18.560 --> 12:20.400
maybe, maybe I am right.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.480
Maybe deep down, I'm right all along.

12:23.920 --> 12:24.480
Don't do that.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.000
Don't do that.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.200
This is not germane to the conversation.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.320
This is a different kettle of fish.

12:28.320 --> 12:31.520
This idea of moving in a non-assigned seat

12:31.520 --> 12:33.440
because somebody sat right next to you

12:33.440 --> 12:36.080
because they really, really, really wanted somebody

12:36.080 --> 12:37.200
to catch them jerking off.

12:38.640 --> 12:41.280
There's no reason why you need to be that person

12:41.280 --> 12:41.920
for this person.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.800
It's important to note here, Question Asker,

12:44.800 --> 12:47.040
that if this theater was, let's say,

12:47.040 --> 12:49.120
maybe there are 10 people in the whole theater, right?

12:49.120 --> 12:51.040
Friday morning, like 10 a.m. showing.

12:51.680 --> 12:55.520
And this guy comes and sits even like one seat over,

12:55.520 --> 12:56.960
even with one seat gap.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.240
Same row, he's a jerker.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.280
Definitely, 100%.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.000
He's a, yeah.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.960
Something, something's going on.

13:02.960 --> 13:03.460
Smell this.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.560
I think that's why if you move rows,

13:06.560 --> 13:08.560
that guy's gonna be like, I sat too close.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.440
That's why I always wear a cop badge

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
just like hanging out of my front pants pocket.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.000
And then like if somebody tries that stuff

13:16.000 --> 13:18.640
and tries to get me to like eye their jerk style,

13:18.640 --> 13:19.920
I keep an eye on their jerks.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.200
Check out these sweet skills.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.400
I point to the badge and I say,

13:22.400 --> 13:23.840
are you sure you wanna do this?

13:23.840 --> 13:24.640
I'll be your huckleberry,

13:24.640 --> 13:25.920
but are you sure you wanna do this today?

13:26.560 --> 13:28.240
Is today, is this how you wanted today to go?

13:28.240 --> 13:29.200
And I'm pointing to my cop's badge

13:29.200 --> 13:33.920
that says Detective Griffin McElroy, attorney at law.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.840
Are you sure about this?

13:35.840 --> 13:37.120
Sir Griffin McElroy.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.160
Listen, I don't wanna tell you how to live your life,

13:40.160 --> 13:42.160
but I'm pretty sure I could get a conviction off this one.

13:43.520 --> 13:47.440
Detergent Griffin, detergent Griffin McElroy, kid cop.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.160
Hi, I'm detergent Griffin McElroy.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.480
I'm here to wipe out the stain of crime.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.760
That you left on the fucking seat with your jerk off.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.160
You guys know who I am?

13:58.160 --> 14:02.480
Maybe you act like you're doing him a solid.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.240
So here's what I'm suggesting.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.960
Like the trailer, your mid trailers,

14:06.960 --> 14:07.920
you're seeing that new,

14:07.920 --> 14:09.840
like they're still making Harry Potter movies

14:09.840 --> 14:11.280
even without Harry Potter.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.680
And you go, no, no, no, no, no.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.440
And you run away from the person

14:15.440 --> 14:16.880
and then you put your hand in your mouth

14:16.880 --> 14:21.760
and kind of go, pretend like you were going to fart.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.200
You didn't wanna expose him to it.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.240
So you ran for it.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.120
You made it a run for it.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.360
Like it was, and you just say to the guy like,

14:27.360 --> 14:30.160
hey, listen, it's gonna be off and on, man.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.200
It's gonna be one of those flicks.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.160
I'll just stay over here.

14:32.160 --> 14:33.920
And he'll be like, solid.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.320
Thanks, fart buddy.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.120
Thanks, fart dude.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.080
Thanks, fart cop.

14:39.920 --> 14:40.400
This Yahoo.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.120
Thanks, detergent.

14:41.840 --> 14:45.280
This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Rosen.

14:45.920 --> 14:46.800
Game recognized game.

14:46.800 --> 14:47.360
Thank you, Rachel.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.000
It's by Yahoo.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.040
Answers user.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.040
Ooh, they're anonymous.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.000
Probably because they're asking

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
about a criminal crime thing.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.920
And they know that detergent Griffin McElroy,

14:55.920 --> 14:59.840
attorney at laws on the case, they ask.

14:59.840 --> 15:00.880
Oh, I give them a name.

15:02.640 --> 15:09.040
Pimbles asks, where to stash weed and pipes?

15:09.040 --> 15:11.360
And then in parentheses, weed smokers only.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.560
So my parents always find it.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.600
In drawers, secret compartments in bed,

15:17.600 --> 15:21.200
used to hide stuff in backpack till school found out.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.880
Where are some good places to hide them?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.640
Nothing dumb like in shoes or things like that.

15:24.640 --> 15:25.520
I've tried everything.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.000
I've seen in videos or tips, but they keep finding it.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.600
Fellow weed smokers, help me out.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.040
Where are you gonna hide that kush and that kush piece?

15:35.040 --> 15:38.400
How many times do your parents and school

15:38.400 --> 15:41.600
have to find it before you just stop?

15:42.640 --> 15:43.520
They're not gonna stop.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.480
What are you talking about?

15:44.480 --> 15:45.840
For some people, it just seems to me

15:45.840 --> 15:48.240
like once you get busted once by school

15:48.240 --> 15:53.120
and once by parents, like they're all so on point

15:53.120 --> 15:54.480
looking for your shit.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.600
You're gonna have to get like a safety deposit box downtown.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.280
But the alternative is you no longer

15:59.280 --> 16:02.160
have that good kush smoke hitting you right in the brain

16:02.160 --> 16:03.920
and making you feel like so nice.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.240
Is there a place, is there a smoke shop?

16:06.240 --> 16:08.400
Much like I've been to beer houses

16:08.400 --> 16:10.480
where like they take your Stein

16:10.480 --> 16:12.640
and they lock it in like a little cabinet

16:12.640 --> 16:15.120
and when you show up, you get your special Stein

16:15.120 --> 16:17.680
to drink from and then they lock it back away.

16:17.680 --> 16:20.080
Maybe there's like a smoke shop where like

16:20.080 --> 16:22.240
they keep your pipe and weed for you

16:22.240 --> 16:25.600
and you come and you sit in a very comfortable chair

16:26.160 --> 16:27.120
in like the back.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.480
You smoke as much as you want

16:28.480 --> 16:30.400
and then they lock your pipe back up

16:30.400 --> 16:31.440
and you head on home.

16:33.280 --> 16:33.520
No.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.000
No, okay.

16:36.000 --> 16:36.480
Not yet.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.480
What if you're delinquent on your payments though

16:40.480 --> 16:44.080
and then they come and they cut your little storage unit open

16:44.080 --> 16:47.040
and then people bid on your gross ass pieces.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.080
I'm looking in there and I see what looks like

16:50.080 --> 16:52.000
a good old little greeny piece

16:52.000 --> 16:54.880
and then behind that, I think I see what appears to be

16:55.440 --> 16:57.520
the carb on a bong.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.360
So I'm gonna assume a bong is in there.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.800
So I think I'm gonna be able to get,

17:01.360 --> 17:02.720
I'm a bit up to 30 on this one,

17:02.720 --> 17:03.680
but we'll see how it goes.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.360
Maybe Elvis's bong is in there.

17:05.360 --> 17:05.840
I don't know.

17:06.960 --> 17:07.440
I don't know.

17:07.440 --> 17:07.920
Maybe a jet ski.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.040
Old arcade games.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.160
Maybe a jet ski's in there.

17:10.160 --> 17:10.880
That would be crazy.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.280
Cause it's a very, it's a small box.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.200
It's like a shoe box, but we'll see.

17:17.520 --> 17:17.760
Maybe.

17:17.760 --> 17:18.560
You could bury it?

17:18.560 --> 17:21.040
You could bury it.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.240
Camouflage?

17:22.240 --> 17:23.840
But then you're gonna need a treasure map.

17:23.840 --> 17:25.040
And what if it grows?

17:25.040 --> 17:25.440
Oof.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.640
Didn't think about that.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.160
Now you're really in the shit.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.960
Yeah, that's federal.

17:30.960 --> 17:31.840
That's a federal thing.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.160
That's a federal offense.

17:34.160 --> 17:34.320
I've got it.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.560
They're gonna thank you for that one, federally speaking.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.200
I've got it.

17:37.760 --> 17:38.560
What?

17:38.560 --> 17:39.120
Okay.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.320
So you've already been caught, right?

17:40.320 --> 17:41.680
So your parents are looking for it.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.200
They're on the lookout.

17:43.200 --> 17:47.200
So you hide it where they would least suspect it.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.880
You hide it in their drawers.

17:49.440 --> 17:50.480
Oh my God.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.520
Deborah, is there something you want to tell me?

17:53.520 --> 17:54.240
Exactly.

17:54.240 --> 17:54.720
Deborah.

17:55.360 --> 17:58.320
Well, we found this, we found this awesome doge and it smells

17:58.320 --> 17:59.600
like a quality strain.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.320
What should we do with it?

18:00.320 --> 18:01.200
Give it to our son?

18:01.200 --> 18:02.000
Yeah, I agree.

18:02.000 --> 18:02.160
Yeah.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.040
We can't be trusted.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.920
Apparently we sleep, we sleep by weed.

18:05.920 --> 18:09.120
There's only one person I know who I would trust to take care

18:09.120 --> 18:10.880
of this kind strain of doja.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.400
And that's my sweet boy, Derek.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.640
Derek, get in here.

18:14.640 --> 18:15.920
Derek, get in here.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.680
How about this, can I- We can't be trusted, Derek.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.680
Can I take it one step further, Travis?

18:19.680 --> 18:20.080
Uh-huh.

18:20.720 --> 18:25.040
Can you tape it to the one place your parents will never see it,

18:25.040 --> 18:26.800
which is your parents' backs?

18:26.800 --> 18:27.280
Okay.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.400
What if you tape it to each of their foreheads?

18:32.960 --> 18:36.160
So that way they don't know about the one on their head,

18:36.160 --> 18:39.280
but they're too embarrassed to say something about the other one's head.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.480
That's very good.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.120
Uh-huh.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.720
They will never see that coming.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.440
Oh, Derek, that was a great hug you just gave me.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.120
Thank you for that great hug, Derek.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.160
Then five minutes later, like,

18:50.160 --> 18:52.400
there's just a weird smell coming from Derek's room.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.960
No, I'm too busy thinking about that great hug you gave me.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.840
So I'm probably not going to investigate.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.200
Maybe he's smoking weed,

18:59.200 --> 19:03.200
but could somebody who hugs like that be still smoking?

19:03.200 --> 19:04.080
Hugs not drugs.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.520
Or in this case, hugs to drugs.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.280
Hugs to drugs, my new program.

19:09.280 --> 19:14.160
Um, yeah, I think that I have the helps.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.080
I'm happily and recently married to a wonderful man.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.960
There is just one problem.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.120
He recently learned how to smize.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.240
At first, he thought it was cute,

19:26.240 --> 19:29.840
but now he does it all the time and it's sort of terrifying.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.400
How can I get my husband to stop smizing

19:32.400 --> 19:35.120
and start smiling like a normal human being?

19:35.120 --> 19:37.760
That's from scared of the smize in North Carolina.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.440
It's my favorite question.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.520
It's very good, but it's also bittersweet, isn't it?

19:41.520 --> 19:44.640
I've only watched like three episodes ever

19:44.640 --> 19:46.160
of America's Next Top Model.

19:46.160 --> 19:49.520
Could you guys please explain to me in detail

19:49.520 --> 19:51.600
what smizing exactly is?

19:51.600 --> 19:53.680
It's like over here at me, Trav, look at me.

19:53.680 --> 19:54.480
Uh-huh.

19:54.480 --> 19:55.440
So this is a smile.

19:56.000 --> 19:56.800
Okay.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.080
Okay, now this is a smize.

19:58.880 --> 19:59.840
All right, okay.

19:59.840 --> 20:00.960
Do you see how it looks like the,

20:00.960 --> 20:03.360
it looks like the top half of his face is twerking?

20:03.360 --> 20:03.860
Uh-huh.

20:03.860 --> 20:08.580
Uh-huh, smizing is, okay, smite, all right.

20:08.580 --> 20:12.180
You know how you've been smiling this whole time, right?

20:12.180 --> 20:12.740
Yes.

20:12.740 --> 20:13.380
What is the key?

20:13.380 --> 20:15.380
You, the listener, enjoying our podcast.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.460
This is a great podcast you see yourself smiling

20:17.460 --> 20:18.420
and enjoying yourself.

20:18.420 --> 20:21.700
Here's what you do, smile like you're remembering

20:21.700 --> 20:26.100
one of our classic, classic runs, runs of gas.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.460
Okay, I'm doing it right now.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.340
Imagine you're remembering one of Travis's great goofs,

20:30.340 --> 20:32.420
Travis, have you got it, Travis?

20:32.420 --> 20:34.100
Yes, I'm picturing my own hilarity.

20:34.660 --> 20:36.500
What's happening with your mouth right now?

20:37.460 --> 20:39.620
It's kind of formed into a smile shape.

20:39.620 --> 20:43.140
Stop, that needs to be straight.

20:43.140 --> 20:47.140
But the rest of your face still does the smiling business.

20:47.140 --> 20:49.620
Oh, I see.

20:49.620 --> 20:53.140
So you're smiling with your eyes or you're smizing.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.580
I see, is it like rubbing your head

20:56.580 --> 20:59.220
and like patting your stomach or whatever at the same time?

20:59.220 --> 21:02.660
Because you can't make the smile with your face.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.380
Well, with your lower half of face.

21:05.380 --> 21:07.780
But you have to, I mean, that's why it's practice, right?

21:07.780 --> 21:11.940
That's why modeling is not all runways and short skirts.

21:11.940 --> 21:13.460
There's a lot of work to it.

21:13.460 --> 21:15.540
You've got to work that hallway like a runway.

21:16.180 --> 21:17.300
God, can we not?

21:17.300 --> 21:20.100
Like it's really, it's too, it's a little bit too soon

21:20.100 --> 21:22.820
because like they tried to placate me with those articles.

21:22.820 --> 21:24.500
It's like, it's coming back for streaming.

21:25.060 --> 21:25.780
It's not.

21:26.820 --> 21:28.580
It's not, like it's probably, it's not.

21:28.580 --> 21:31.140
And I've been trying to fill the gap with RuPaul's Drag Race,

21:31.140 --> 21:34.420
which is like so terrific in so many like incredible ways

21:34.420 --> 21:36.580
and a lot of ways is superior to ANTM

21:36.580 --> 21:38.100
in like every conceivable way.

21:38.100 --> 21:40.100
But you always remember your first, don't you?

21:41.460 --> 21:43.940
The first cut is the deepest

21:43.940 --> 21:45.780
and I'll be damned if Tyra didn't cut me

21:45.780 --> 21:47.780
really, really deep to the bone.

21:48.420 --> 21:49.860
Her husband is smizing.

21:50.420 --> 21:50.740
Yes.

21:51.300 --> 21:53.540
How do we feel about that broadly speaking?

21:53.540 --> 21:54.660
Are we okay with that?

21:54.660 --> 21:57.780
Like, do you really want a family like for your Christmas photo?

21:57.780 --> 21:59.380
Like you're all just beaming

21:59.380 --> 22:01.460
and Philip is in the background like,

22:02.420 --> 22:04.900
this is a really hard conversation to make funny

22:04.900 --> 22:06.660
because everything I'm doing with my face is like,

22:06.660 --> 22:08.340
it's classic and lost.

22:08.340 --> 22:08.980
Yeah, yeah.

22:10.660 --> 22:12.980
Can you combat it every time he smizes?

22:12.980 --> 22:13.700
Can you tooch?

22:14.260 --> 22:14.980
Ooh.

22:14.980 --> 22:16.180
Ooh.

22:16.180 --> 22:17.700
Is that farting?

22:17.700 --> 22:20.260
Tooching is like farting without the fart.

22:20.260 --> 22:20.580
Okay.

22:20.580 --> 22:21.700
Tooching is like when you-

22:21.700 --> 22:22.900
Like you're gonna get a good one out.

22:23.460 --> 22:24.580
Like Stanley Toochie.

22:24.580 --> 22:26.740
Yeah, when you morph all of the muscles in your face

22:26.740 --> 22:28.820
to appear like Stanley Toochie,

22:28.820 --> 22:31.060
when you turn your own face into like a grim

22:31.060 --> 22:32.980
Stanley Toochie mask of death.

22:32.980 --> 22:34.580
My husband wants out Toochie-ing.

22:35.620 --> 22:36.900
My husband is Stanley Toochie.

22:37.540 --> 22:37.940
And at first-

22:37.940 --> 22:38.900
And he wants out smizing.

22:38.900 --> 22:39.940
At first I thought it was cute,

22:39.940 --> 22:41.460
but now he's Stanley Toochie all the time

22:41.460 --> 22:42.500
and it's sort of terrifying.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.580
How can I get my husband to stop Stanley Toochie?

22:46.020 --> 22:47.780
I have to stop Stanley Toochie.

22:48.340 --> 22:50.980
I've come back from the future to stop Stanley Toochie

22:50.980 --> 22:52.020
before he kills again.

22:53.860 --> 22:56.420
Stanley Toochie is gonna make his own Hunger Games sequel

22:56.420 --> 22:57.780
just starring Stanley Toochie

22:57.780 --> 22:58.500
and the Stanley Toochie character.

22:58.500 --> 22:59.540
Mr. President, get down!

22:59.540 --> 23:00.340
It's Toochie!

23:00.340 --> 23:01.540
It's called Back to the Tootcher.

23:03.700 --> 23:04.660
I've got it bad.

23:04.660 --> 23:05.540
Hot for Tootcher.

23:06.100 --> 23:07.300
Hot for Tootcher is also good.

23:07.300 --> 23:08.660
That'll be the spinoff.

23:08.660 --> 23:10.660
If they can fucking make Harry Potter movies

23:10.660 --> 23:11.540
without Harry Potter in them,

23:11.540 --> 23:13.860
I don't think we can't make Back to the Future

23:13.860 --> 23:16.340
without Marty and Doc and the crew.

23:16.340 --> 23:18.980
Or any other character except Stanley Toochie.

23:18.980 --> 23:22.100
Yeah, beloved Back to the Future character,

23:22.100 --> 23:22.900
Stanley Toochie.

23:22.900 --> 23:30.660
Can you imagine how livid it's Star Wars premiere night,

23:30.660 --> 23:32.900
December 18th, I guess 17th,

23:33.780 --> 23:36.260
over there in jolly old London

23:36.980 --> 23:40.900
and poor the marquee dims,

23:40.900 --> 23:42.660
the lights of the theater go down

23:42.660 --> 23:45.060
and up starts the trailer for

23:47.620 --> 23:49.940
magical creatures and where to find them

23:49.940 --> 23:52.820
or magical beasts and where to find them or whatever.

23:52.820 --> 23:56.660
And that music starts and the font and what all.

23:57.220 --> 24:01.700
Can you imagine the pure shock and despair

24:02.260 --> 24:03.540
that must have crossed the face

24:03.540 --> 24:06.180
of a young Daniel Radcliffe in the audience that night?

24:06.740 --> 24:07.860
How could they?

24:07.860 --> 24:09.620
Wait, am I in this?

24:09.620 --> 24:10.820
Am I in this?

24:10.820 --> 24:14.420
How do I not remember whether or not I did this?

24:14.420 --> 24:15.700
Is he Harry Potter?

24:16.500 --> 24:19.460
This is so upsetting to me, Daniel Radcliffe.

24:19.460 --> 24:22.020
Me, Daniel Radcliffe, beloved actor.

24:22.020 --> 24:25.940
I, Daniel Radcliffe, am just now finding out about this.

24:25.940 --> 24:28.980
Why didn't anyone tell me, Daniel Radcliffe, about this?

24:28.980 --> 24:31.060
Is this punishment for the dick thing I did?

24:32.260 --> 24:33.540
I said I was sorry.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.500
I apologize for my penis thing in the play, okay?

24:37.700 --> 24:39.060
I have to call Jon Hamm.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.780
I called every child in America individually,

24:41.780 --> 24:44.020
not in London because like we're fucking cool with it,

24:44.020 --> 24:46.020
but I called every child in America individually

24:46.020 --> 24:48.820
and I apologized for my penis thing in the play.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.740
But it's not, I wasn't improvising.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.700
It wasn't like I pulled my penis out every night of Equus.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.780
Like, and they, I got notes.

24:55.780 --> 24:58.340
Okay, Daniel, you did a great job up there,

24:58.340 --> 25:00.660
but please, please, please, please, please,

25:00.660 --> 25:01.700
stop taking your penis out.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.660
It's not in the script and it's just for you.

25:04.660 --> 25:06.020
Like it's just for you and you could,

25:06.020 --> 25:07.380
I can tell it's just for you.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.220
Let's say what we've all been thinking.

25:09.860 --> 25:10.660
The great hog.

25:10.660 --> 25:12.020
The little kid.

25:12.020 --> 25:13.940
DR, DR.

25:13.940 --> 25:15.060
Real magical boner.

25:15.060 --> 25:16.740
The young man who played Harry Potter

25:16.740 --> 25:18.900
got his dick out in a play about horses.

25:18.900 --> 25:19.780
He did it for us.

25:20.420 --> 25:22.900
He did it as a goof favor to us.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.340
And now he's gonna be punished for it

25:24.340 --> 25:26.020
by them making a Harry Potter movie

25:26.020 --> 25:28.580
and just copying, pasting out Harry Potter.

25:28.580 --> 25:29.940
Like fucking Eddie Redmayne,

25:29.940 --> 25:31.940
like Eddie Redmayne hasn't gotten his dick out

25:31.940 --> 25:33.220
in a play before.

25:33.220 --> 25:37.380
I saw a production of fucking Bye Bye Birdie

25:37.380 --> 25:40.820
where he whipped out his trouser snake, his dingus.

25:41.700 --> 25:42.740
He played Birdie.

25:42.740 --> 25:44.420
And we all forgot about that, huh?

25:44.420 --> 25:45.380
He actually played Hugo.

25:45.380 --> 25:47.700
So anyway, it's not right.

25:47.700 --> 25:48.100
Both.

25:48.100 --> 25:49.220
He actually played all the parts.

25:49.220 --> 25:49.940
He played all the parts.

25:49.940 --> 25:52.420
It was like his dick out the whole show.

25:52.420 --> 25:52.740
Yeah.

25:52.740 --> 25:53.860
It was conceptual.

25:53.860 --> 25:56.420
I thought it was actually pretty fucking incredible.

25:56.420 --> 25:56.900
Yeah.

25:56.900 --> 25:57.860
Was it cutting edge?

25:57.860 --> 25:58.900
Of course it was.

25:58.900 --> 25:59.380
It was.

26:00.980 --> 26:03.220
With a score by Lin-Manuel Miranda.

26:03.220 --> 26:03.460
Right.

26:03.460 --> 26:05.460
Which I thought was maybe a weird pivot for him.

26:05.460 --> 26:06.100
But yeah.

26:06.900 --> 26:07.780
Aim high, I guess.

26:07.780 --> 26:21.940
Can I tell you about a new advertiser, Justin?

26:21.940 --> 26:22.340
Yeah.

26:22.340 --> 26:28.660
Last night, my daughter, Charlie Gale, got a little choked up

26:28.660 --> 26:30.740
because I was making her laugh at this great game

26:30.740 --> 26:31.860
where I pretended to be a ghost.

26:31.860 --> 26:32.660
Nice.

26:32.660 --> 26:36.100
And she got choked up and then she puked all over my sheets.

26:36.100 --> 26:36.420
Okay?

26:36.420 --> 26:37.140
Nice.

26:37.140 --> 26:38.100
Ruined them.

26:38.100 --> 26:38.660
Ruined.

26:39.460 --> 26:43.940
And then literally five minutes after that happened,

26:43.940 --> 26:48.500
knock on the door, UPS man, what did I get but a delivery

26:48.500 --> 26:50.180
from Bowl and Branch.

26:50.180 --> 26:52.500
B-O-L-L and Branch.

26:52.500 --> 26:55.140
Bowl and Branch brought sheets to me.

26:55.700 --> 26:55.940
Yeah.

26:56.900 --> 26:58.820
In the exact moment of my need.

27:00.020 --> 27:03.060
That's funny that you say that because in a related story,

27:03.060 --> 27:05.460
yesterday I shit my pants.

27:05.460 --> 27:06.900
And then who's that knocking at the door?

27:06.900 --> 27:07.540
It's me undies.

27:07.540 --> 27:09.780
And they had me covered as well in the same way.

27:10.340 --> 27:11.140
That's crazy.

27:11.140 --> 27:12.500
We're not talking about them though this week.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.860
We're talking about Bowl and Branch.

27:13.860 --> 27:16.180
I just wanted to tell a fun story about when I shit my pants

27:16.180 --> 27:17.300
and me undies was like,

27:18.020 --> 27:19.780
they basically changed me like a mommy would.

27:20.340 --> 27:20.740
Okay.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.540
But the important thing is Bowl and Branch.

27:23.540 --> 27:26.340
They and the sheets were some of the best I've ever slept on.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.260
They were fantastic.

27:28.260 --> 27:30.340
There's one important thing you do to make sure you have a good

27:30.340 --> 27:32.180
day and let's get good sleep the night before.

27:33.140 --> 27:36.500
You can go to Bowl and Branch.

27:36.500 --> 27:39.300
They're gonna make that possible for you.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.540
They've reinvented sheets and bedding with the sole purpose

27:41.540 --> 27:45.700
of making your nights more comfortable than ever.

27:45.700 --> 27:46.340
And here's the thing.

27:46.340 --> 27:47.380
Maybe you're sitting there thinking,

27:47.380 --> 27:49.940
oh, I've tried to buy sheets before I go to the,

27:49.940 --> 27:53.620
you know, I go to the store and they're so expensive

27:53.620 --> 27:55.780
and I don't know anything about thread count

27:55.780 --> 27:58.740
and I'm a big sheets dummy and I'm stupid

27:58.740 --> 28:01.060
and I don't know what's good, but stop it.

28:01.060 --> 28:01.700
You're great.

28:02.500 --> 28:05.220
One, two, the thing is at the stores,

28:05.220 --> 28:06.580
you get so much overhead, right?

28:06.580 --> 28:08.100
Because you're not just paying for the sheets.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.060
You're paying for the building.

28:09.060 --> 28:09.940
You're paying for the lights.

28:09.940 --> 28:11.060
You're paying for all the employees.

28:11.060 --> 28:13.620
You're paying for so much stuff that has nothing to do with the sheets.

28:13.620 --> 28:16.020
You're paying for the special permit that buildings have to have

28:16.020 --> 28:17.540
to have that many sheets inside of them.

28:17.540 --> 28:18.180
Correct.

28:18.180 --> 28:20.420
But Bowl and Branch, they keep the overhead low.

28:20.420 --> 28:21.540
They don't sell in stores.

28:21.540 --> 28:22.820
They just sell online.

28:22.820 --> 28:24.100
They don't worry about thread count.

28:24.100 --> 28:26.900
They just get good cotton.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.100
That's what's important.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.540
Thread count is a myth.

28:29.540 --> 28:33.380
That's the thing that people tell you to make you buy overpriced sheets.

28:33.380 --> 28:37.220
Bowl and Branch, they just focus on great sheets.

28:37.220 --> 28:38.340
And so here's the thing.

28:38.340 --> 28:40.260
Right now, you can go online to bowl.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.420
Can it please be my turn to talk about Blue Apron?

29:18.420 --> 29:19.860
Talk about Blue Apron, God.

29:23.140 --> 29:28.580

And then it was up to you to solve the puzzle of how to make the meal out of those parts.

29:35.380 --> 29:37.220
Ooh, what do you win if you solve it?

29:37.220 --> 29:37.700

This week, just yesterday, I made udon chicken noodle soup, which turned out super good.

29:59.540 --> 30:00.260
It was super tasty.

30:00.260 --> 30:02.740
I'm not even like a chicken noodle soup guy, and it turned out great.

30:02.740 --> 30:07.300
Little pro tip, a little food hack to put a little bit of sriracha in that, and it won't

30:07.300 --> 30:08.580
lead you the wrong way.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.540
Let me tell you about the ones for this week, right?

30:11.540 --> 30:15.460
So the week of the 11th, when you're listening to this, here are some.

30:16.180 --> 30:19.700
Buffalo chicken sandwiches with blue cheese salad.

30:19.700 --> 30:20.200
Damn.

30:20.200 --> 30:23.400
Seared salmon and salsa verde with orange spinach.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.440
Ooh, I love the way you say verde.

30:24.440 --> 30:25.640
Can you hit me with verde?

30:25.640 --> 30:26.680
Oh, Jesus.

30:26.680 --> 30:27.400
Oh, shit.

30:27.400 --> 30:32.840
Chicken and drop biscuit casserole with, yeah, Cajun fried catfish and collard greens.

30:32.840 --> 30:35.400
Lamb and beef gyros with roasted cauliflower.

30:35.400 --> 30:35.960
That's fucking plenty.

30:35.960 --> 30:36.520
Stop it.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.040
Yeah, there's so many.

30:38.040 --> 30:39.720
I think you mean collard verdes.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.220
Verde.

30:40.220 --> 30:42.600
Listen, last night.

30:42.600 --> 30:45.800
And there's also, it's important to note, there's also vegetarian options.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.160
Those are just all the meat options.

30:47.160 --> 30:48.840
But listen, Travis, listen.

30:48.840 --> 30:58.760
Last night, I ate rib-eye steak, perfectly prepared, thank you, Justin, with a hash made

30:58.760 --> 31:03.400
of cremini mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, and roasted potatoes, thank you, Blue Apron.

31:03.400 --> 31:05.000
Them shits was a slam dunk.

31:05.000 --> 31:05.500
Anyway.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.280
Yeah, a slam dunk, right?

31:06.280 --> 31:07.080
It's really amazing.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.520
It's changed my life legit.

31:08.520 --> 31:15.080
I've learned how to cook and made really amazing meals for myself and my wife with Blue Apron.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.120
Huh?

31:16.120 --> 31:19.320
And my wife.

31:19.320 --> 31:20.440
I didn't say anything.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.840
It's also important to note that if you're sitting here and going, yeah, but I don't

31:22.840 --> 31:23.640
know how to cook.

31:23.640 --> 31:27.000
Like, I buy all my meals frozen because I don't know what I'm doing.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.280
They give you step by step, incredibly easy to follow instructions.

31:30.280 --> 31:30.920
Easy peasy.

31:54.920 --> 31:56.920

32:23.080 --> 32:25.640
The only right way to prepare mini corn dogs?

32:25.640 --> 32:26.680
Do you like back rubs?

32:26.680 --> 32:28.040
Of course you like those two things.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.720
Let's go get down with Drink the Sauce.

Fetch.

32:34.120 --> 32:34.440
Hang.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.160
We also have a message for David.

32:37.160 --> 32:38.280
It's from Sarah.

32:38.280 --> 32:43.400
And it says, you know how we were going to donate some money to a good cause?

32:43.400 --> 32:45.400
Well, I decided to use it for this instead.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.360
This is the best cause.

32:46.360 --> 32:47.720
This is the best cause.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.160
Happy 30th birthday.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.880
Since you hate your birthday and everything surrounding it,

32:51.880 --> 32:55.480
I thought we should celebrate it with NBNB AM's billions of listeners.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.880
Here's to hundreds more awesome birthdays.

32:57.880 --> 32:59.320
I love you, Robot David.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.480
If only Robot David could feel love.

33:03.080 --> 33:06.360
Well, that's the gift of the Magi twist right there, isn't it?

33:06.360 --> 33:07.240
It's more of the term-

33:07.240 --> 33:08.920
We needed this money to buy bolts.

33:08.920 --> 33:09.880
It's the Terminator twist.

33:09.880 --> 33:11.800
Because if Robot David understood what love is,

33:11.800 --> 33:13.640
it would definitely, definitely be self-aware.

33:13.640 --> 33:14.520
And that would be the ball game.

33:15.240 --> 33:16.200
Happy birthday, Robot David.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.960
That's what turned them into the Terminator?

33:17.960 --> 33:21.480
Is they understood love and so he came back to kill John Connor?

33:21.480 --> 33:22.760
Any complex human emotion.

33:23.560 --> 33:23.880
Anything.

33:23.880 --> 33:24.280
Okay.

33:24.280 --> 33:26.280
So like anger and like-

33:26.280 --> 33:27.480
That's not very complex, is it?

33:27.480 --> 33:28.040
And hunger.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.160
No, anger's pretty straightforward.

33:31.160 --> 33:32.600
Desire for donuts.

33:32.600 --> 33:33.000
Horny.

33:33.640 --> 33:34.360
Horny.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.560
Horny for donuts.

33:35.560 --> 33:39.800
Are you troubled by a lack of astute yet dick joke filled analysis of bad movies?

33:39.800 --> 33:45.000
Do you experience feelings of laughter and enjoyment when you hear three friends go off on stupid tangents?

33:45.000 --> 33:51.080
Have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter, ghost, or totally rad party dude house cat

33:51.080 --> 33:53.560
who really only exists as a sound effect?

33:53.560 --> 33:55.720

I'm pretty sure we don't have the rights to this song.

34:22.280 --> 34:22.760
Here's a yahoo.

34:22.760 --> 34:23.800
Do you guys want a yahoo?

34:23.800 --> 34:24.600
Yes.

34:24.600 --> 34:27.320
Do you guys want to hear me do a yahoo and then we'll talk about it?

34:27.320 --> 34:28.120
Absolutely.

34:28.120 --> 34:28.680
Yeah.

34:28.680 --> 34:31.720
Um, got a couple here.

34:31.720 --> 34:32.920
Hmm, got a couple here.

34:34.200 --> 34:35.080
Do the best one.

34:35.880 --> 34:39.240
Well, one of them is about Britishisms and I feel like we maybe already did that a bunch.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.880
Oh yeah, that would not be great.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.800
I think we, like, yeah, I think we got that.

34:44.360 --> 34:48.280
Um, this, this one was sent in by level 9000 Yajiru Drew at Drew Davenport.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.000
Thank you, Drew.

34:49.000 --> 34:55.000
It's by Yajiru Answers user Cheetara who asks,

34:57.400 --> 35:00.760
if you could live in someone's shoes for a day, who would it be?

35:00.760 --> 35:01.260
Gross.

35:01.260 --> 35:01.760
What?

35:03.480 --> 35:07.000
If you could live in someone's shoes for a day, who would it be?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.440
And then additional details.

35:09.560 --> 35:10.680
Scott Bakula's wife.

35:12.440 --> 35:12.940
Okay.

35:14.040 --> 35:14.840
What?

35:14.840 --> 35:16.280
Asked and answered.

35:16.280 --> 35:16.920
Put it away.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.480
File this one under read and completed.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.320
So this is more of like a John Malkovich scenario,

35:25.320 --> 35:28.760
like being John Malkovich and not like little old lady who lived in a shit.

35:28.760 --> 35:32.840
I don't think he would be a, a silent passenger.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.400
It's a silent passenger.

35:35.400 --> 35:38.360
What if he was on business that one day?

35:39.400 --> 35:40.360
One day.

35:40.360 --> 35:41.400
Oh, what a twist.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.120
Where are you?

35:42.120 --> 35:43.480
I'm in New Orleans.

35:43.480 --> 35:44.280
I'm on set.

35:44.280 --> 35:45.320
On a shoot.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.800
I'm on set on the big easy.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.720
Like you need to calm down right now.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.080
You're not on camera, Scott.

35:51.080 --> 35:52.200
We've talked about this.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.760
For God's sake, Scott, dial it, rein it in.

35:54.760 --> 36:02.520
I'm just trying to get, find me a poor boy down on the, down on the swamp lands.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.080
Scott, you're melting.

36:05.800 --> 36:06.920
Boundaries, Scott.

36:06.920 --> 36:07.560
Boundaries.

36:09.400 --> 36:13.640
Can anybody find me one of them little crispy Louisiana donuts?

36:13.640 --> 36:15.240
I done forgot what they called.

36:16.360 --> 36:17.320
Hey Scott, it's me.

36:17.320 --> 36:18.280
Dean Stockwell.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.160
Your best friend.

36:19.160 --> 36:20.040
Your wife called me.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.640
She said she was really, really worried.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.040
Oh, Dean, you gotta calm down.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.720
I'll show you a good time.

36:25.720 --> 36:27.960
Scott, first, first things first, Scott.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.840
Listen, first things first, they're called beignets.

36:31.480 --> 36:33.960
Second things first, rein it in.

36:36.040 --> 36:38.840
Third things third, I've been controlled by somebody

36:38.840 --> 36:41.000
who's left into my body for a day.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.200
We're getting real close to gushy territory.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.960
We do need to pedal away.

36:45.960 --> 36:46.520
Pedal away.

36:46.520 --> 36:49.160
We're away from gushy territory.

36:49.160 --> 36:54.200
If you could live in someone's shoes for a day, who would it be?

36:54.200 --> 36:56.600
Love, love Scott Bakula's wife.

36:56.600 --> 36:57.320
Please, God, let me out of this.

36:57.320 --> 36:57.880
You know who I'd like to be?

36:59.480 --> 37:00.600
Who would you like to be?

37:00.600 --> 37:02.680
I'd like to be that Benedict Cumberbatch.

37:04.040 --> 37:05.320
Everyone seems to like him.

37:05.320 --> 37:08.200
Yeah, he's very, he's very busy though.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.640
I don't think that'd be great.

37:09.640 --> 37:11.800
Cause you pop, you pop into his body and then like,

37:11.800 --> 37:13.960
he's like on set in the new Star Trek or whatever.

37:13.960 --> 37:17.400
And then he, you fuck up his takes and then he never works again.

37:17.400 --> 37:20.760
Cause Travis, you're great at acting, but you wouldn't know how to control his body.

37:20.760 --> 37:21.240
You just wouldn't.

37:21.240 --> 37:21.720
That's true.

37:21.720 --> 37:23.080
It's a completely different mechanism.

37:23.080 --> 37:26.440
But I will say this, maybe it's a mutually beneficial thing.

37:26.440 --> 37:30.440
I jump in, I get to feel what it's like to be a Benedict Cumberbatch.

37:30.440 --> 37:34.600
But also Benedict Cumberbatch, I forced him to take the day off for once.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.360
Take a little Benedict time, right?

37:36.360 --> 37:37.720
And he's able to recover.

37:37.720 --> 37:38.840
Next day he wakes up and he's like,

37:38.840 --> 37:40.920
I feel like I've had a great day the day before.

37:40.920 --> 37:41.960
I don't remember any of it.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.320
Or is he in my body?

37:43.320 --> 37:44.360
Do we switch places?

37:44.360 --> 37:45.720
Is it a Freaky Friday thing?

37:45.720 --> 37:47.960
He's good for my career because he's in my body.

37:47.960 --> 37:50.840
I'm good for his mental health and wellbeing because I'm in his body.

37:50.840 --> 37:52.760
So we each learn a little bit about each other.

37:52.760 --> 37:55.320
He jumps into your body right when you're doing

37:55.320 --> 37:57.400
whatever it is Travis does at any given time.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.800
And I'm just saying, just looking at your schedule,

37:59.800 --> 38:01.640
I'm just going to say eating an entire ham.

38:02.600 --> 38:03.640
And he hops in, he's like,

38:04.760 --> 38:06.200
and chokes on the ham a little bit

38:06.200 --> 38:07.800
because he wasn't expecting to have ham in his mouth

38:07.800 --> 38:09.560
because he was just acting in the new Star Trek movie.

38:09.560 --> 38:12.120
And it was like wham, bam, thank you ham right there in his mouth.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.560
And he was like, what is this?

38:13.560 --> 38:15.400
What's this? What's all this said?

38:16.280 --> 38:17.480
Where's my cheekbones?

38:18.760 --> 38:19.880
Why do I have a beard?

38:21.160 --> 38:23.960
It's like Dr. Manhattan wearing a wig anymore.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.040
I look like just a regular person.

38:26.040 --> 38:28.040
This will be my greatest acting challenge ever.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.320
But then they would know that you weren't him, Travis,

38:31.320 --> 38:34.920
because the ultimate test for a fake Benedict Cumberbatch.

38:34.920 --> 38:38.520
If they made a recreation of The Thing,

38:38.520 --> 38:39.880
the horror movie The Thing,

38:39.880 --> 38:41.720
and they had to do the test to figure out who's alien

38:41.720 --> 38:42.680
and who is not alien.

38:42.680 --> 38:45.240
And in the fiction of this The Thing remake,

38:45.240 --> 38:46.520
first of all, it would be the second remake

38:46.520 --> 38:48.440
because they did remake it a few years ago.

38:48.440 --> 38:50.520
But everybody in it would be British actors

38:50.520 --> 38:51.960
and they would be playing themselves.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.760
And then you have the Benedict Cumberbatch there

38:54.760 --> 38:55.800
and it's like, Benedict Cumberbatch,

38:55.800 --> 38:57.000
we need to test if you're an alien or not.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.160
He's like, well, I won't say how that's gonna happen.

38:59.160 --> 39:01.800
And it's like, well, say your own name.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.440
And he's like, oh, it's easy.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.040
It's been, but it's Jumbadatch.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.040
It's Bimby Buck Blumberbatch.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.800
And it's like, kill him, fucking kill him.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.440
Get him, kill him, kill him, Hugh Laurie.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.480
And then I'm on the run.

39:14.520 --> 39:17.480
But luckily I've got those super long Cumberbatch legs.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.640
Yeah, you got those daddy long Cumberbatch legs.

39:20.520 --> 39:23.080
Just leaping over small children, hurdles.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.000
Much like Jack Skellington.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.600
Do you think when he heard they were making a movie

39:26.600 --> 39:27.720
called The Amazing Spider-Man,

39:27.720 --> 39:29.560
he was like, I'll audition for that.

39:29.560 --> 39:30.520
Cause I am one.

39:32.680 --> 39:35.160
Finally, I can unspool my other four legs

39:35.160 --> 39:37.160
that I keep tied to my body at all times.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.720
Benedict Cumberbatch is a living spider.

39:39.720 --> 39:40.440
True.

39:40.440 --> 39:41.480
Giant living spider.

39:41.480 --> 39:41.960
Right.

39:41.960 --> 39:43.560
I should have said giant spider.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.640
A living spider is not that impressive.

39:45.640 --> 39:47.160
Most are, I think.

39:48.280 --> 39:50.600
I share an apartment with another graduate student at home.

39:50.600 --> 39:55.000
We split rent, chores, kind of, and utilities.

39:55.560 --> 39:59.080
Our university gets an entire month off of school

39:59.080 --> 39:59.640
during winter.

40:00.520 --> 40:02.200
They've given specific dates here.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.320
That wasn't necessary.

40:03.320 --> 40:03.720
Thank you.

40:04.280 --> 40:05.240
And I went home.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.600
The dates are December 14th to January 19th.

40:08.600 --> 40:09.400
That's crazy.

40:09.400 --> 40:10.840
That's a long ass time.

40:10.840 --> 40:11.640
Chill break.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.560
Yeah, very chill.

40:13.560 --> 40:14.360
I went home.

40:14.360 --> 40:15.400
He remained at the apartment.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.400
The day I left, I paid my share of the utilities,

40:17.400 --> 40:19.480
which ended on like the 10th or the 11th.

40:19.480 --> 40:22.360
Now, since I paid that, I have not set foot in the apartment,

40:22.360 --> 40:25.640
meaning I haven't used an iota of utilities the whole month.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.320
The utilities will be due soon,

40:27.320 --> 40:28.760
and I don't know what to do.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.320
I just know he's gonna try to get me to pay half the utilities,

40:31.320 --> 40:32.520
even though I haven't used any.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.760
Am I responsible for half the utilities?

40:34.760 --> 40:36.840
My girlfriend thinks I should just pony up to keep the peace,

40:36.840 --> 40:37.400
but I don't know.

40:38.840 --> 40:40.360
What do you do, Sam?

40:40.360 --> 40:42.280
Okay, we've done this fucking question before.

40:42.280 --> 40:44.360
We did it from the other person's perspective.

40:44.360 --> 40:46.280
My deadbeat roommate won't pay for the utilities

40:46.280 --> 40:47.320
because he was gone for a month.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.680
Let's put this fucking thing to bed.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.360
Unless you're gonna start measuring out

40:50.360 --> 40:51.880
how much water everybody drinks

40:51.880 --> 40:52.920
and then come up with the ratio

40:52.920 --> 40:54.920
of how much of the water bill they're gonna start paying,

40:54.920 --> 40:57.320
you can't extrapolate that shit to this degree.

40:57.320 --> 40:58.440
You pay for your utilities.

40:58.440 --> 40:59.240
It's your house.

40:59.240 --> 41:01.320
You can't like, how many volts?

41:01.320 --> 41:02.600
How many volts, Brian?

41:02.600 --> 41:04.760
No, just pay your half the utilities.

41:04.760 --> 41:06.520
That's not how utilities works.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.720
When you enter into the lease,

41:09.720 --> 41:12.200
like you enter an agreement that we're splitting it.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.120
Not like while we're here.

41:14.120 --> 41:16.600
The only way out of this scenario

41:16.600 --> 41:19.480
is it's like you have to find someone to enter the cave

41:19.480 --> 41:20.760
so you can leave.

41:20.760 --> 41:23.240
Like you could like sublet your apartment

41:23.240 --> 41:24.440
for that month that you're gone,

41:24.440 --> 41:26.840
at which point, yeah, it's not your responsibility.

41:26.840 --> 41:28.120
It's that other person's.

41:28.120 --> 41:29.960
But right now there's a ghost of you

41:29.960 --> 41:32.440
still living in the apartment and it's all your stuff.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.040
And as long as all your stuff is there

41:34.040 --> 41:35.480
and your ghost is there,

41:35.480 --> 41:36.520
you have to pay half of that.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.440
Hold on, because I almost let you get away

41:38.440 --> 41:40.440
with what you said.

41:40.440 --> 41:42.200
There's a ghost of him there?

41:42.200 --> 41:45.640
Yeah, like his specter is still taking up the spot.

41:45.640 --> 41:47.400
I can't tell if you're speaking poetically

41:47.400 --> 41:49.160
or you're talking about like an actual phantasm

41:49.160 --> 41:50.280
that is like turning lights off.

41:50.280 --> 41:51.800
Well, I was speaking poetically,

41:51.800 --> 41:53.720
but now I'm thinking that maybe it would be better

41:53.720 --> 41:55.080
for the goof if I was speaking literally.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.520
And we're off to the races.

41:56.520 --> 41:59.800
Okay, but I mean, if you think about it,

41:59.800 --> 42:02.600
you're still there, like it's still your apartment.

42:03.640 --> 42:04.440
Like think about this,

42:05.080 --> 42:06.680
like you're the only one living in the apartment

42:06.680 --> 42:07.800
and you left for a month.

42:07.800 --> 42:09.960
You couldn't call your landlord and be like,

42:09.960 --> 42:11.880
I don't think I should have to pay rent.

42:11.880 --> 42:12.840
I wasn't there.

42:13.400 --> 42:14.440
Like that's not how it worked.

42:14.440 --> 42:15.400
You're in an agreement.

42:15.400 --> 42:18.120
Yeah, like you can't, it doesn't work this way.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.040
The agreement that you have made is that like,

42:20.040 --> 42:22.200
I'm gonna take this space of earth

42:22.200 --> 42:24.120
and keep it from chaos.

42:24.120 --> 42:27.640
Like I will try to tame this piece of the wilderness

42:27.640 --> 42:28.680
and I will do my part.

42:28.680 --> 42:31.160
And part of that is like paying some money

42:31.160 --> 42:35.240
to keep it like warmed and watered and full.

42:35.240 --> 42:36.200
Now I will say this.

42:36.200 --> 42:38.600
Yeah, if you get back, right?

42:38.600 --> 42:40.680
And half the people have been living in the apartment

42:40.680 --> 42:44.520
for a month and your utilities are still the same amount.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.400
I think it does open up a conversation.

42:47.400 --> 42:48.200
You still have to pay.

42:48.200 --> 42:49.400
You still have to pay.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.000
But you can go to roommate and be like,

42:51.000 --> 42:53.640
hey, what were you doing while I was gone?

42:53.640 --> 42:56.600
Were you just like leaving water running for like days on it?

42:56.600 --> 42:58.120
How is it still the same?

42:58.120 --> 42:59.240
Half the people were here.

42:59.240 --> 43:01.160
You have to get more conservative

43:01.160 --> 43:02.760
about your utility use, Derek.

43:02.760 --> 43:03.880
You're using it all up.

43:03.880 --> 43:06.600
Have you seen a documentary?

43:06.600 --> 43:07.800
For your information,

43:07.800 --> 43:10.360
I had to put an inflatable cloud in the shower

43:10.360 --> 43:12.680
and turn it on while I played cool jerk

43:12.680 --> 43:14.840
to scare away some robbers.

43:14.840 --> 43:15.720
You monster.

43:16.760 --> 43:18.840
Thanks for asking how my break was.

43:18.840 --> 43:22.440
I had to put some weird hyper heater thing on a doorknob

43:22.440 --> 43:24.360
and I think you just choose through energy.

43:24.360 --> 43:27.320
And by the way, let's not talk about what that thing was

43:27.320 --> 43:29.480
because have they ever explained

43:29.480 --> 43:30.840
what the fuck that was that Kevin put up?

43:30.840 --> 43:32.760
I think it was a cattle brand.

43:32.760 --> 43:35.560
How the fuck do you have that McAllister's?

43:35.560 --> 43:38.040
It's from my weird sex dungeon.

43:38.040 --> 43:40.360
He has some access to things, huh?

43:40.360 --> 43:42.360
He got some access to some stuff, dude.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.040
He's Amazon Prime.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.160
What did he put on that doorknob?

43:47.160 --> 43:49.000
What did he put on that fucking doorknob that burned?

43:49.000 --> 43:50.600
How did it not burn the house down?

43:50.600 --> 43:53.640
How was it hot enough that it burned human flesh

43:53.640 --> 43:55.560
touching the other side of it?

43:55.560 --> 43:56.680
If the metal was red.

43:56.680 --> 43:58.920
That didn't like burn the house down.

43:58.920 --> 44:00.120
I can remember watching that as a kid

44:00.120 --> 44:02.440
and seeing that and thinking, I don't know what that is,

44:02.440 --> 44:05.720
but I bet when I'm an adult that I'll know what that is.

44:05.720 --> 44:06.840
They just don't let me know about it

44:06.840 --> 44:08.280
because I'm still a kid.

44:08.280 --> 44:10.840
Well, the bills come due, Chris Columbus.

44:10.840 --> 44:11.480
I'm an adult.

44:11.480 --> 44:13.320
I still don't know what the hell he's doing with that thing.

44:14.200 --> 44:15.800
That's some sci-fi bullshit.

44:15.800 --> 44:17.560
If it could make metal turn red,

44:17.560 --> 44:21.160
it would have set Joe Pesci's skeleton on fire

44:22.280 --> 44:23.080
inside of him.

44:24.840 --> 44:28.120
There's literally a point in the second one

44:28.120 --> 44:32.440
in which Daniel Stern is turned into an electrified skeleton

44:32.440 --> 44:33.160
and then he's fine.

44:33.880 --> 44:35.800
I almost always said Daniel Craig,

44:35.800 --> 44:37.080
but I knew that wasn't it.

44:38.200 --> 44:39.640
That would be a way better movie.

44:40.200 --> 44:41.880
We're Sticky Bandits, aren't we?

44:41.880 --> 44:44.280
How British is this episode?

44:45.960 --> 44:49.240
Daniel Craig versus Macaulay Culkin.

44:49.240 --> 44:50.280
Man, I would watch that movie.

44:50.280 --> 44:51.720
I'd watch the hell out that movie.

44:53.160 --> 44:56.520
So this is saying that, oh God,

44:56.520 --> 44:58.200
guess where I got this data?

44:58.200 --> 44:59.640
Uh, Yahoo Answers?

44:59.640 --> 45:00.920
Yeah, yeah.

45:01.480 --> 45:03.800
This says an iron is on top of the door

45:03.800 --> 45:06.040
and there's a bit of rope connected to the iron

45:06.040 --> 45:08.280
and wrapped around the door, which makes it hot.

45:08.280 --> 45:09.000
What?

45:09.000 --> 45:09.320
What?

45:09.320 --> 45:10.600
No, no.

45:11.560 --> 45:13.320
He hangs like what looks to be

45:14.040 --> 45:17.240
like just a portable heating element from an oven

45:18.120 --> 45:19.240
onto a doorknob.

45:19.240 --> 45:21.400
There is also an iron,

45:21.400 --> 45:23.480
but that's a completely separate shenanigan.

45:23.480 --> 45:25.320
I'm not saying to believe that Kevin McCallister

45:25.320 --> 45:27.400
is like a young Elon Musk

45:27.400 --> 45:30.920
and has invented like some sort of super heater rope.

45:32.120 --> 45:33.640
That movie would be sick too, wouldn't it be?

45:33.640 --> 45:36.840
Like the McCallister's parents would come home

45:36.840 --> 45:38.760
and there'd be all these like weird ornaments

45:38.760 --> 45:40.040
hanging on the trees and be like,

45:40.040 --> 45:41.640
what are these weird ornaments?

45:41.640 --> 45:43.560
And he'd be like, oh, well, I'm Elon Musk.

45:43.560 --> 45:46.680
So I just divided Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern

45:46.680 --> 45:49.880
down to their like chemical elemental components.

45:49.880 --> 45:51.320
Like that right there, that little element,

45:51.320 --> 45:53.560
that ornament there, that's Joe Pesci's carbon.

45:53.560 --> 45:54.440
Isn't that crazy?

45:54.440 --> 45:55.240
I'm Elon Musk.

45:56.040 --> 45:57.160
I'm a murderer.

45:57.160 --> 45:58.120
I have an answer.

45:58.920 --> 46:02.680
It is an electric charcoal lighter.

46:03.640 --> 46:04.200
Is what?

46:04.200 --> 46:05.560
Is what he has there.

46:05.560 --> 46:05.560
That's nothing.

46:05.560 --> 46:07.320
It's an electric charcoal lighter.

46:07.320 --> 46:08.200
That's not a thing.

46:08.200 --> 46:09.960
Do Google image search and you'll be like,

46:09.960 --> 46:10.920
ah, dunk.

46:10.920 --> 46:11.960
I guess that's what it was.

46:11.960 --> 46:12.520
Hold on.

46:12.520 --> 46:13.960
You still won't know what it is though.

46:14.760 --> 46:15.960
What does one do with that?

46:15.960 --> 46:19.560
It wouldn't, I think you like charcoal electronically speaking.

46:19.560 --> 46:20.760
I, thank you.

46:20.760 --> 46:21.320
But like.

46:21.320 --> 46:24.760
But you wouldn't set, you wouldn't turn metal red enough

46:24.760 --> 46:27.240
to set Joe Pesci's skeleton on fire inside of him.

46:28.040 --> 46:28.520
Wouldn't happen.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.920
And you also probably shouldn't leave this

46:30.920 --> 46:32.200
where kids can get to it.

46:33.320 --> 46:36.600
Well, that's true of like everything in the McAllister household.

46:37.640 --> 46:37.960
Yeah.

46:37.960 --> 46:43.080
Like what is everyone in that house doing the rest of the year

46:43.080 --> 46:45.720
that justifies all of this crazy shit?

46:45.720 --> 46:45.960
Yeah.

46:48.520 --> 46:49.240
Killing burglars.

46:49.240 --> 46:54.040
It's got to be, they have to be like a freelance burglar killing.

46:54.040 --> 46:57.560
It's like Dexter, but like way not as justified

46:57.560 --> 46:58.680
for the stuff that they're doing.

46:59.240 --> 46:59.720
You know what I mean?

46:59.720 --> 47:01.400
Like Dexter kills serial killers.

47:01.400 --> 47:03.800
They just go to like, if they find out that a shitty burglar

47:03.800 --> 47:06.440
is planning a heist anywhere in one of their neighbors houses.

47:06.440 --> 47:08.440
And I'm sure their neighbors like look the other way, right?

47:08.440 --> 47:09.880
Cause they don't want to get burgled.

47:09.880 --> 47:11.960
Well, it's a, it's a family full of vigilantes.

47:11.960 --> 47:15.160
And like when you're a vigilante, everyone's like, I don't,

47:15.160 --> 47:16.120
I wouldn't do it.

47:16.120 --> 47:18.440
I don't condone it, but I understand the need of it.

47:18.440 --> 47:20.040
It's not the family we want.

47:20.040 --> 47:21.480
It's the family we deserve, right?

47:21.480 --> 47:22.120
Is that it?

47:22.120 --> 47:25.240
If, but let me hit you with this.

47:25.800 --> 47:30.040
If the wet bandits have killed, then Home Alone

47:30.040 --> 47:32.200
is a lengthy prequel to Dexter.

47:32.760 --> 47:35.720
Like it could be envisioned that way that like,

47:35.720 --> 47:37.320
this is how he gets his start.

47:37.320 --> 47:39.320
He wants to let, make it take its time.

47:39.880 --> 47:40.920
They have also killed.

47:40.920 --> 47:43.880
They do that off screen the moment before the shot

47:43.880 --> 47:46.200
like opens up before the film begins.

47:46.200 --> 47:48.440
That's a weird tone to set, don't you think?

47:48.440 --> 47:50.120
It's that's why it's not in the film, right?

47:50.120 --> 47:51.800
It's in my fan fiction that I've written.

47:53.160 --> 47:53.560
Hold on.

47:53.560 --> 47:55.240
I have a flyer here somewhere.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.880
Crumple, crumple, crumple to my backpack.

47:57.880 --> 47:58.680
Hold on.

47:58.680 --> 47:59.080
Justin.

47:59.080 --> 48:01.800
I am not coming to the dramatic reading of your fan fiction.

48:01.800 --> 48:02.360
Hold on.

48:02.360 --> 48:03.080
It's in here somewhere.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.960
Home Alone, Home Alone Zero, Blood in the Snow.

48:10.040 --> 48:10.280
Wow.

48:10.280 --> 48:11.560
That's a big fucking backpack.

48:12.120 --> 48:12.440
Yeah.

48:12.440 --> 48:14.120
There's a lot of documents.

48:14.120 --> 48:16.440
A lot of prequels to a lot of things.

48:16.440 --> 48:17.320
What else you got in there?

48:17.320 --> 48:18.520
What other pre-pre's?

48:18.520 --> 48:19.800
What other pre-pre's you got?

48:19.800 --> 48:21.560
I got a prequel to Uncle Buck.

48:21.560 --> 48:22.840
It's called My Brother Buck.

48:25.400 --> 48:25.720
Kids.

48:27.960 --> 48:28.840
We got one.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.040
It looks like we got Cool Runnings.

48:30.040 --> 48:33.080
This one's just called Runnings because they were doing that before.

48:33.080 --> 48:33.960
It's just regular.

48:34.520 --> 48:35.720
They just do it regular.

48:37.960 --> 48:40.840
There's a prequel to the fly called The Guy.

48:40.840 --> 48:41.480
I have that.

48:42.200 --> 48:43.080
It's in here.

48:43.080 --> 48:43.960
I can't find it.

48:43.960 --> 48:45.000
I'll have to get it later.

48:46.440 --> 48:47.720
You should publish these.

48:47.720 --> 48:49.400
I've been telling you that for years.

48:49.400 --> 48:50.360
You're right.

48:50.360 --> 48:51.240
You're right.

48:51.240 --> 48:52.120
What are you afraid of?

48:55.800 --> 48:56.440
Just failure.

48:56.440 --> 48:57.960
Just being ostracized.

48:57.960 --> 49:00.600
I have a Forrest Gump prequel called Dumb Baby.

49:02.440 --> 49:03.240
Well, that one's mean.

49:03.960 --> 49:04.520
What?

49:04.520 --> 49:05.400
That one's mean.

49:06.200 --> 49:06.520
Why?

49:08.120 --> 49:08.680
It's not his fault.

49:08.680 --> 49:10.360
He's canonically dumb.

49:10.360 --> 49:10.760
Okay.

49:10.760 --> 49:11.880
But that's a dumb like you can't-

49:11.880 --> 49:13.240
That's not a good like you can't be like,

49:13.240 --> 49:14.440
here's a prequel to Borat.

49:14.440 --> 49:15.640
It's called Young Borat.

49:17.400 --> 49:18.920
No, but like if you said,

49:18.920 --> 49:20.040
here's a prequel to Borat.

49:20.600 --> 49:21.640
It's called Hairy Baby.

49:22.200 --> 49:24.440
That would be a different thing.

49:24.440 --> 49:25.240
Foreign Baby.

49:25.960 --> 49:26.280
Okay.

49:26.280 --> 49:29.240
But then so then to extrapolate that like anything,

49:29.240 --> 49:31.000
anything like Sling Blade-

49:31.000 --> 49:33.800
Oh, you're saying it's not special because it's like a baby.

49:33.800 --> 49:34.120
Yeah.

49:34.120 --> 49:35.320
This is Billy Bob Baby.

49:35.320 --> 49:36.040
What?

49:36.040 --> 49:36.200
Sorry.

49:36.200 --> 49:37.160
The prequel to Sling Blade.

49:39.560 --> 49:40.280
Baby Bob.

49:40.280 --> 49:41.160
Baby Bob.

49:41.160 --> 49:42.200
Baby Bob Thornton.

49:42.200 --> 49:44.440
Baby Bob.

49:44.440 --> 49:46.200
This is called Adventures in Baby.

49:46.200 --> 49:48.360
It's about when the babysitter was a baby.

49:48.360 --> 49:48.600
Right.

49:48.600 --> 49:50.280
Adventures in Our Parents Are Home.

49:52.040 --> 49:52.760
It's the sequel.

49:53.880 --> 49:55.640
Please tell mom the babysitter's fine.

49:58.200 --> 49:59.080
Check in with mom.

49:59.080 --> 50:00.360
The babysitter just got here.

50:01.560 --> 50:05.560
Dustin serves orbits for the right place to check into

50:05.560 --> 50:07.240
because later he'll be checking in.

50:08.680 --> 50:10.520
Dustin confirms his reservation.

50:10.520 --> 50:13.800
Dustin has to wait till 4 p.m.

50:13.800 --> 50:15.480
because the room's not quite ready yet.

50:15.480 --> 50:17.400
This is my new movie, The Hendersons.

50:22.760 --> 50:25.000
Do you guys want to go out to the woods this weekend?

50:25.000 --> 50:25.480
Yeah.

50:25.480 --> 50:26.280
Sure.

50:26.280 --> 50:26.920
Sounds fun.

50:27.880 --> 50:31.400
Have you seen the new historical musical 1775?

50:33.240 --> 50:34.520
Everything's pretty chill.

50:34.520 --> 50:36.040
It's pretty chill actually.

50:36.040 --> 50:37.480
So is that it?

50:38.040 --> 50:38.360
Yeah.

50:38.360 --> 50:43.560
Yep, that's gonna do it for us here on My Brother, My Brother, Me.

50:43.560 --> 50:44.840
We hope you've had some fun.

50:45.880 --> 50:47.320
We also hope you've learned something.

50:47.320 --> 50:48.760
Hope you've grown, right?

50:49.800 --> 50:51.240
Learned something and grown.

50:54.840 --> 50:57.880
Want to say a big thank you to John Roderick and Long Winter

50:57.880 --> 51:00.920
who used their theme song It's a Departure off the album

51:00.920 --> 51:01.880
Putting the Days to Bed.

51:02.520 --> 51:04.360
You can go get that and just enjoy it.

51:05.160 --> 51:05.880
Just drink it in.

51:05.880 --> 51:09.800
We also want to say thanks again to Blue Apron who makes cooking at home easy.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.400
Even if you have no idea what you're doing,

51:11.400 --> 51:15.800
you can get your first two meals free by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

51:15.800 --> 51:18.040
We are all three users, all three fans.

51:18.040 --> 51:20.040
Blueapron.com slash my brother.

51:22.920 --> 51:24.280
Can we talk about new projects?

51:25.160 --> 51:25.480
Yeah.

51:26.440 --> 51:30.040
Is your new project gonna be live by the time this goes up, you think?

51:30.600 --> 51:31.240
Hard to say.

51:31.240 --> 51:34.520
Probably not, but I can say that I'll give a little bit more details.

51:34.520 --> 51:37.000
Teresa and I are working on a new podcast

51:37.720 --> 51:39.800
that we're hoping to have live and ready to go.

51:39.800 --> 51:42.760
We're traveling this weekend, so that kind of slowed us down a little bit.

51:42.760 --> 51:45.800
But hopefully, at least by the end of the month, if not sooner.

51:46.520 --> 51:47.880
So keep an eye out for that.

51:47.880 --> 51:49.480
My wife Rachel and I made a podcast.

51:50.120 --> 51:51.000
It'll be out.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.360
I think I'll get it up today, actually.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.360
Although it's not gonna be on iTunes.

51:54.360 --> 51:55.320
Just look at my Twitter.

51:55.320 --> 51:56.840
I'll tweet about it, where to find it.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.320
Still tentatively titled.

51:59.320 --> 52:00.840
I think we're gonna go with Rose Buddies,

52:00.840 --> 52:02.520
and it's our podcast where we talk about The Bachelor,

52:02.520 --> 52:04.600
The Bachelor in Paradise family products.

52:05.320 --> 52:06.920
Very enthusiastic about this project.

52:07.960 --> 52:09.640
Please listen and let me know what you think.

52:09.640 --> 52:11.560
If we should do a full podcast out of it.

52:11.560 --> 52:16.200
Also, I've started a new video series on Polygon called Griffin's Amiibo Corner.

52:16.200 --> 52:17.480
We're reviewing Amiibo toys.

52:18.520 --> 52:20.520
Griffin and I make a lot of video game videos.

52:20.520 --> 52:23.960
A lot of people still are just now getting into it.

52:24.920 --> 52:27.080
Search YouTube for a series called Monster Factory

52:27.080 --> 52:29.000
that Griffin and I make.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.600
A lot of people will like that.

52:30.600 --> 52:32.760
We need to get back on that fucking bus.

52:32.760 --> 52:35.560
It's about us trying to break video games and succeeding,

52:35.560 --> 52:36.920
but also breaking ourselves.

52:37.800 --> 52:39.560
We also do a lot of other podcasts.

52:39.560 --> 52:43.640
You can check out Sawbones, The Adventure Zone, Bunker Buddies,

52:43.640 --> 52:46.200
Trends Like These, Can I Pet Your Dog?

52:46.200 --> 52:48.440
Also, Till Death Do Us Blart.

52:48.440 --> 52:49.720
We haven't mentioned it in a while.

52:49.720 --> 52:53.960
It's our annual podcast with us and the guys from The Worst Idea of All Time,

52:53.960 --> 52:58.440
where every American Thanksgiving we watch and review Paul Blart Mall Cop 2

52:58.440 --> 53:01.880
for the rest of time when one of us dies, we will be replaced

53:01.880 --> 53:03.320
and the show will continue.

53:03.320 --> 53:05.080
You can find it on iTunes.

53:05.080 --> 53:06.680
Till Death Do Us Blart.

53:07.720 --> 53:08.840
Is that going to do it?

53:08.840 --> 53:09.400
We have other shows.

53:09.400 --> 53:11.640
There's other shows on the Maximum Fun Network you should also listen to.

53:11.640 --> 53:12.040
Oh, sure.

53:12.040 --> 53:17.400
Jordan Jesse Go, Can I Pet Your Dog, Stop Podcasting Yourself, Throwing Shade.

53:17.400 --> 53:20.120
There's a new show called Getting Curious that's very funny.

53:20.120 --> 53:22.040
There's a ton, a ton, a ton, a ton of stuff,

53:22.040 --> 53:24.920
and it's all free and it's all good to listen to with your ears.

53:24.920 --> 53:29.000
It's all at Maximumfun.org, just waiting for you to experience it.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.040
And we haven't mentioned it in a while,

53:30.040 --> 53:35.080
but if you want to hear us talk about either something business-wise

53:35.080 --> 53:37.560
or something personal on the Money Zone,

53:37.560 --> 53:40.840
just go to Maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

53:40.840 --> 53:43.720
Be aware that we're, you know, pretty solidly booked.

53:43.720 --> 53:46.840
So if you want something in the future, go buy it now.

53:47.800 --> 53:48.300
Okay.

53:49.240 --> 53:52.760
Oh, and there's a lot of merch, www.MaxFunStore.com.

53:52.760 --> 53:53.000
Yes.

53:53.000 --> 53:53.880
We've probably talked enough.

53:53.880 --> 53:55.400
We also have the Maximum Fun Facebook group,

53:55.400 --> 53:56.600
which is quickly turning into, like,

53:56.600 --> 54:00.840
Lin-Manuel Miranda's just, like, private, just dumping grounds on me.

54:01.480 --> 54:03.000
Well, that's the My Brother, My Brother and Me group.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.360
We also have the Maximum Fun group.

54:04.360 --> 54:04.840
Oh, yeah.

54:04.840 --> 54:05.720
Join both of them.

54:06.280 --> 54:07.400
All right, let's wrap this shit up.

54:09.240 --> 54:10.360
That's gonna do it for us.

54:10.360 --> 54:11.880
Griffith, you have a final Yahoo.

54:11.880 --> 54:13.800
Yeah, this one was sent in by Liz Bush.

54:13.800 --> 54:14.680
Thank you, Liz.

54:14.680 --> 54:17.160
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Black, who asks,

54:19.160 --> 54:21.720
Did anybody have sex in the 1990s?

54:21.720 --> 54:25.560
Did it feel different from now?

54:25.560 --> 54:27.000
My name's Justin McElroy.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.840
I'm Travis McElroy.

54:28.840 --> 54:30.040
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

54:30.040 --> 54:30.760
Kiss your dad.

54:32.280 --> 54:33.080
On the lips.

54:33.080 --> 54:52.120
Maximum Fun.org.

54:52.120 --> 54:53.160

And I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

Every Tuesday, we bring you Sawbones, a marital tour of Misguided Medicine, a show about all

55:07.240 --> 55:11.720
the dumb, weird, terrible ways that we've tried to fix each other over the years.

55:11.720 --> 55:13.880
You know, some light summer listening.

55:13.880 --> 55:18.520
Maybe you want to hear about yogurt enemas or why we tried to eat mummies for a while

55:18.520 --> 55:22.040
or why drinking cholera diarrhea sounded like a good idea.

55:22.040 --> 55:28.200
That and so much more is waiting for you every Tuesday right here on the Maximum Fun network

55:28.200 --> 55:35.880
