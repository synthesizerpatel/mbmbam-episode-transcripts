WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.160 --> 00:50.160
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:56.060
It's better it's better with you

01:00.300 --> 01:02.300
Better it's better

01:09.680 --> 01:16.480
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother me an advice show for the modren era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:16.480 --> 01:18.960
I'm Travis the middlest

01:20.160 --> 01:26.760
Wow, and I'm Griffin Mack. Are you okay? Trav? I've watched the trailer at least six times. I lost count in there

01:26.760 --> 01:30.680
It's it has over 11 million views on

01:31.640 --> 01:34.920
Wild for this fucking thing. It's not just our people

01:35.640 --> 01:41.600
It could possibly be just our people watching it 10,000 times. Do we even need to say what it is?

01:41.600 --> 01:48.020
Like what project we're talking VB. It's just MVB MVB. Yeah, no matter who wins we lose

01:48.120 --> 01:51.360
Well, it's my tagline for it whether man wins or beam wins

01:51.360 --> 01:55.300
We we win actually because we're gonna have a fucking great time watching this flick

01:57.880 --> 02:02.000
Yeah, might if I just play the trailer in its entirety and I'll kind of just oh this is good

02:02.000 --> 02:05.080
Actually, what's happening? This is good. Hey, I'm not plugged in on Twitter

02:05.400 --> 02:10.540
It's it is impossible that there are people out there listening to this who are over this bit, right?

02:10.540 --> 02:16.300
No, everyone is still deeply. Okay. Okay trailer roughly 180 times. Okay, cool

02:16.660 --> 02:20.980
Okay, so I'll just walk you guys through it and I'll pause where necessary. Okay, okay

02:22.100 --> 02:23.700
All right

02:23.700 --> 02:25.500
Okay, we see

02:25.500 --> 02:27.500
Bean is in

02:27.820 --> 02:29.220
court

02:29.220 --> 02:30.940
smashing glass

02:30.940 --> 02:32.940
He's burning down buildings

02:33.660 --> 02:35.660
And he's in a lot of trouble

02:35.660 --> 02:42.140
There was this be okay, so now we're rewinding to the beginning of it. He's a house sitter

02:44.740 --> 02:48.540
Now pot could you I I need everybody

02:49.140 --> 02:54.860
To listen to this line delivery when he I guess is leaving like a voicemail for his daughter

02:55.380 --> 02:57.060
It is

02:57.060 --> 02:58.980
the worst

02:58.980 --> 03:21.820
Delivery of a line if you're negative about this, but I don't want to do it. We're not gonna do it Now, okay there he's knocked over a statue because he's trying to swat a bee that is staring him dead in his fucking face. And can we just address like

03:21.820 --> 03:30.180
It's pause can we just address that I feel like the big spoiler has happened just in this trailer and that we know that he is the

03:31.060 --> 03:33.060
first aggressor

03:33.060 --> 03:38.740
He shoots across the bow first and like and we're supposed to sympathize with this being man

03:38.740 --> 03:43.720
I don't think I don't I actually I would pause it we are not there is one

03:44.300 --> 03:47.960
Shot a very close-up detailed HD shot of the bee

03:47.960 --> 03:51.760
Very early on in which I would say the bee is

03:52.480 --> 03:58.720
CGI'd very sympathetically very good. Yeah, I look at that face and that's a face that's just like hey

03:58.720 --> 04:00.720
I just wanted to say I'm a huge fan

04:01.440 --> 04:03.440
Rowan if I could get just like

04:04.560 --> 04:08.720
Fucking in to you. This part is not the most comfortable for me

04:08.720 --> 04:12.560
I have my hand like on the soundboard and on the play button and everything

04:12.560 --> 04:18.280
So if I could just go ahead and make through the next 50 seconds of this bit. Sure. Sure. Sure. Thank you. All right

04:19.080 --> 04:22.140
Okay, now I do have to stop there because he's hit himself in the knee

04:25.240 --> 04:29.560
He's hit himself in the knee with what crowbar trying to kill the bee now

04:29.560 --> 04:33.440
I don't know how mad you have to be to hit yourself in the knee with a crowbar

04:33.440 --> 04:36.640
But it's very bad. It's if you're using if you're picking a bee killing weapon

04:36.760 --> 04:40.000
You don't need something that heavy bees aren't that big

04:40.000 --> 04:43.920
It's good to go sort of like wide and light like a like a racket of some sort

04:43.920 --> 04:51.120
And how and I would have to assume he's intoxicated in order to make the play of like I'm just cuz because even if he had

04:51.120 --> 04:55.320
Struck the bee. Yeah, he's still gonna hit his knee underneath right gonna hurt him

04:55.320 --> 04:59.740
So it's not like the bee moved and that caused the injury pain, right?

04:59.740 --> 05:01.600
The bee would not have absorbed

05:01.600 --> 05:08.600
He might have just lived with the pain if it meant ending that bee and and like rubbing it so deeply into him that he becomes

05:08.600 --> 05:10.600
All right, everybody shut up

05:13.280 --> 05:16.320
He's trying to get the bee out he's throwing a pillow at the bee

05:16.800 --> 05:21.600
There's a dog that's destroying stuff and there's a pan on fire and now he's now

05:21.600 --> 05:25.640
Okay. Now we do have to talk about the shower sequence. Yes, we do. We do

05:25.960 --> 05:34.240
And like I was really hoping really to Christ's in heaven that I would be able to watch this with my kids

05:34.240 --> 05:38.520
But if I'm gonna see mr. Beans fucking dick

05:39.280 --> 05:42.120
While I'm trying to watch him in the bug life

05:42.120 --> 05:46.640
I don't think that that's something that I'm not ready for my kids to see a

05:47.280 --> 05:51.800
British dick, do you know what I mean or a dick of a dick of any stripe or

05:52.520 --> 05:55.960
Convex ass or he's ass an asshole

05:57.960 --> 06:02.400
Convex ass and the way he reacts to the bee is like the bee is perving on him

06:02.400 --> 06:05.840
Like always just want to see some dick. Yeah

06:07.360 --> 06:12.520
Okay, so he's naked in there and there's a pretty good chance that in the full show you're gonna see some dick yeah

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
He's trying to kill with a racket now he's using explosives

06:20.320 --> 06:23.440
It looks like the bee died, but I can't imagine that's right

06:23.440 --> 06:29.080
And the bees flying up his pants and making him dance to a police officer. He's trying a plunger

06:29.080 --> 06:33.320
That has not worked. I'm

06:34.680 --> 06:40.320
Going to make that a sound for my soundboard when he says where are you a counterpoint Justin?

06:41.160 --> 06:45.480
Pothole small pothole here. Hi Travis pothole to get in it does work

06:46.000 --> 06:51.240
He traps it underneath the plunger. Yeah, and then for some reason

06:52.080 --> 06:56.800
Releases it he can't finish it. He can't all you would have to do is jab the plunger downward

06:56.800 --> 07:04.680
Or simply leave it you can murder the bee through inaction once you have trapped the bee underneath the plunger the air supply is limited

07:04.680 --> 07:07.600
It's not gonna be able to eat the honey. It needs to eat to live

07:08.240 --> 07:10.040
fucking the

07:10.040 --> 07:15.360
Absolute best if one episode was like like he gets it under the plunger, right?

07:15.360 --> 07:18.840
And then it episode like cut to black credits

07:18.960 --> 07:24.160
The next episode is him with the plunger over the bee in one shot

07:24.160 --> 07:26.160
Oh waiting for it

07:28.620 --> 07:31.020
Begins to like converse with the bee, right?

07:31.020 --> 07:35.980
Yeah, you brought this on yourself and like I I don't want to listen. I'm going through some stuff

07:35.980 --> 07:40.580
I lost my job, but I haven't been able to take my daughter on holiday for six years. Yes

07:41.220 --> 07:43.380
Check this though. He lets the bee die

07:44.060 --> 07:49.260
Through just through wasting away inside of the plunger and he's like finally

07:49.260 --> 07:53.140
I'm free and he goes to leave the house and the door is locked from the outside

07:53.140 --> 07:55.140
Oh

07:55.140 --> 08:01.180
My god, it tunneled out. No, I'm no Rowan Atkinson then died then dies

08:02.420 --> 08:08.460
Inside he's trapped. There's a lot of air inside a house though. Probably food too. Yeah, it takes a while. Okay

08:08.860 --> 08:11.880
Yeah, now it is time for some fan theories

08:12.940 --> 08:16.980
Fan theory. Yes already has fans you think my fan theory. I got two

08:17.380 --> 08:22.180
Okay, I watched the trailer six times one. There's no bee. That's great

08:22.180 --> 08:25.020
We don't see anyone else like interact with the bee

08:25.600 --> 08:27.600
Right. The bee is all in his head

08:29.060 --> 08:33.420
So he invented the bee well, I wouldn't say

08:35.700 --> 08:43.100
Echoing makes it sound like he's just in your house like a separate room. Yeah, it does sound like you're being visited by

08:44.180 --> 08:46.600
famous famous British comic Rowan Atkinson

08:47.420 --> 08:49.420
He's hunting you

08:49.420 --> 08:52.800
Yeah, uh, he's he's after me. Um, I

08:53.880 --> 08:59.080
Would also posit this so the bees are real. That's yes. This is where we're at. That's a fan theory

08:59.080 --> 09:05.080
Very number one, right? This is a moonlight situation. He is the bee and the bee is him and all that stuff

09:05.880 --> 09:09.960
But also number two right there at the beginning right off the bat

09:09.960 --> 09:16.100
We see in the trailer the judge is like 14 counts of like vehicular, you know

09:16.600 --> 09:18.320
misconduct or whatever and

09:18.320 --> 09:21.720
like arson and all these things and he's like

09:21.720 --> 09:28.160
Well, there was this bee and I think right the way that traditional writing goes we are to be like, yeah

09:28.160 --> 09:30.000
He's not an inventor

09:30.000 --> 09:31.360
What now you're the X?

09:31.360 --> 09:37.560
Well, I mean I'm just saying I've seen movies and TV shows is that he has to convince the judge that it's not his fault

09:37.560 --> 09:43.840
It was a bee but I'm sitting here a citizen of the real world thinking even if the judge was like, okay

09:43.840 --> 09:50.300
There was a bee sure you're still up on charges of 14 counts

09:50.800 --> 09:52.800
Yeah, they're not gonna like

09:52.820 --> 09:59.340
Found innocent because of oh, there was a bee cool. Cool. Cool. I guess I'll let you off this arson charge

09:59.340 --> 10:03.020
That would be an amazing. It was like well, there was a bee

10:03.020 --> 10:09.380
I mean, he's you can't find him a guilt was a bee the bee defense. Of course. Damn it

10:09.380 --> 10:11.380
It's fucked up that this is not interactive

10:11.380 --> 10:13.380
Do you not like?

10:14.060 --> 10:19.580
I think it should be because I just drives you crazy watching and do all this stuff in the trailer and I'm thinking the whole

10:19.580 --> 10:21.460
Time like that's not how I would do it

10:21.460 --> 10:25.460
Do you know like I see him try to hit it with a crowbar and it's like that's not the weapon

10:25.460 --> 10:28.680
I would have chosen give me the option to control

10:30.300 --> 10:34.380
You hit a bee with a pillow a pillow would fuck it up not kill it

10:35.060 --> 10:38.500
But it would definitely damage its membranous wings. Yeah

10:38.500 --> 10:44.300
um, where how are we sort of balancing in our head the

10:45.060 --> 10:52.340
How much we want to watch man versus be the most amount? That's the most amount nothing

10:52.340 --> 10:55.580
That's the most yeah, that's what's versus. Yeah be

10:56.100 --> 11:02.020
No, just Netflix's propensity for elevating some ungrateful voices. Yeah. No, absolutely

11:02.740 --> 11:05.740
Are we balancing this? I'm gonna torrent it. Oh

11:05.740 --> 11:11.020
My god, you you think that there's gonna be enough of us

11:11.020 --> 11:16.220
There's fucking 11 million views on the trailer just that's great. That's great

11:16.220 --> 11:21.300
If our audience alone seeds this thing then it's going to split we need

11:21.660 --> 11:26.740
You can't stop the signal fucking Ricky Gervais. You fucking ding-dong

11:27.340 --> 11:33.460
It uh, yeah, I guess this is a good. I mean we have actually been in the this and past

11:33.460 --> 11:36.420
We've been in the room with Netflix a couple times

11:36.740 --> 11:40.140
To ask him if they wanted to give us large sums of money to make art

11:40.140 --> 11:44.300
They pass think that wait that they passed so this is not punitive

11:44.300 --> 11:47.820
But I do think that that particular stream has run dry. That's fine

11:47.820 --> 11:50.820
I can't imagine we're gonna be in any more rooms than Netflix

11:50.820 --> 11:56.680
Which is fine cuz I'd give them a piece of my mind right now. Yeah. Yeah only ten episodes of man versus me

11:56.680 --> 11:58.380
That's the worst thing

11:58.380 --> 12:06.380
As a platform that's the worst Justin. I'm glad you brought that up because one of the things I assumed a trailer would reveal is

12:07.060 --> 12:10.220
the deep story twists and turns

12:11.060 --> 12:14.260
That a ten episode series could play with right?

12:14.260 --> 12:20.820
I and I don't want to Apple storage just but Moon I had six episodes and there was a fuck ton of story in there

12:20.820 --> 12:27.260
Right. I'm watching this trailer and I'm thinking okay, so he okay. He hits his knee with a crowbar. Got it

12:27.260 --> 12:28.660
He takes a shower

12:28.660 --> 12:35.300
Okay, he drives his car bad. He knocks over a statue. Okay. He has a court case. Where's the way?

12:36.100 --> 12:38.580
What's filling up these ten episodes of plot?

12:39.140 --> 12:45.540
It's still that is Travis. I'm so glad you said it because I'll be damned if I can figure out how this is

12:45.540 --> 12:48.500
No, I don't know still can no clue

12:49.300 --> 12:57.100
This is ten episodes if you told me they were ten minute long episodes. I still like okay, but still I had a fun

12:57.100 --> 13:00.640
Idea and I don't know the legality of it

13:00.640 --> 13:07.180
But I have also famously endorsed shoplifting in a major way. So this does feel kind of on brand for me

13:07.780 --> 13:09.940
What if we opened up a?

13:11.380 --> 13:14.300
Single Netflix account, uh-huh

13:15.540 --> 13:22.640
Upon which one could stream man versus B or I suppose any of the other programs on the Netflix

13:22.640 --> 13:27.520
Channel, I guess it depends on how restrictive you can get with parental controls

13:30.880 --> 13:36.180
My child Jim Murphy to only watch man versus be everything else is far too secular

13:36.840 --> 13:39.720
So we have this we have this one

13:39.720 --> 13:43.080
I didn't notice the deep religious undertones in the movie

13:43.080 --> 13:47.960
We have this one Netflix account and the three of us can share it just to watch man versus B

13:47.960 --> 13:55.280
But also we could give it the login information out on the podcast so that anybody could watch man versus B

13:55.280 --> 13:59.560
Whenever they want to how does that? How does that got millions of views on the show?

13:59.560 --> 14:05.080
But here's the weird thing guys. Yeah from one account. Yeah, god. Damn it. What?

14:06.560 --> 14:11.000
Ah, I'm just I know what we have to do and it sucks

14:11.000 --> 14:13.120
I feel like I'm at the Garden of Gethsemane

14:13.120 --> 14:18.680
Gethsemane. Yeah, I'm asking the Lord to take it away from me. Like don't don't make me do it dad

14:19.200 --> 14:23.400
Don't make me don't make me get up on the cross pops. Please don't make me do

14:23.400 --> 14:27.600
What do we have because I know what we I know we have to do and I don't want to do it

14:27.600 --> 14:29.080
And once I say it

14:29.080 --> 14:35.400
I can't unsay a shot for shot remake where a shot for shot remake of the first episode of man versus B star

14:35.400 --> 14:39.080
yeah, it's a shot for shot sweated remake of of

14:39.080 --> 14:47.680
Man versus B's first episode starring us and we actually have to we have to so hard it is so hard

14:48.240 --> 14:51.760
For the three of us to get together. Yeah to create

14:52.880 --> 14:54.080
an

14:54.080 --> 14:55.400
sort of

14:55.400 --> 14:56.620
licensed

14:56.620 --> 15:00.240
Intellectual property things that will be in any way

15:00.760 --> 15:07.640
Lucrative and at the very least won't lose us money in a court battle with Netflix and also let's just use the word watchable

15:07.640 --> 15:10.760
What watch it? Yeah, it pleasurable. Yeah, I

15:11.520 --> 15:13.800
But we have to write we have to do it

15:13.800 --> 15:19.280
I think because I'm worried about giving Netflix the like boy kind of see how bad it is views. Well, don't worry

15:19.760 --> 15:23.180
Have we got we're the mr. Pibb to their dr. Pepper. I

15:23.960 --> 15:25.960
Feel like you guys know

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
You guys are not appreciating

15:28.520 --> 15:35.040
The unity the great sense of unity that could come out of the world sharing one Netflix account

15:35.040 --> 15:37.440
just to watch man versus B

15:37.440 --> 15:41.840
I feel like we jumped over that idea and I thought it was a really really good one. No, no, no

15:41.840 --> 15:48.680
It's that's extremely powerful. I'm saying that has to be step one because you're not gonna get anything out of our remake

15:48.680 --> 15:55.280
Mm-hmm, if you're not, you know, like if you haven't seen the array gotta compare it. Yeah, we gotta compare now

15:55.280 --> 16:00.040
Let me add this joke Griffin just to sweet the pot what everybody can use it

16:00.040 --> 16:04.280
But you can only add one thing to the list just because I really want to see what

16:04.280 --> 16:06.280
You know a couple hundred

16:07.080 --> 16:12.520
No way fuck that honor system on our system gang only man versus be on our system

16:12.520 --> 16:16.380
I don't want to get in there and see if people are watching too hot to handle season two. Yeah

16:16.960 --> 16:20.980
No, no, you're not watching anything else, but I want to see what the algorithms do

16:21.360 --> 16:27.360
With so many different people's ad adding one thing each to the list and the algorithms like I don't know man

16:27.360 --> 16:33.560
Um, yes, we're gonna have to pay for it with some sort of fucking

16:34.120 --> 16:37.300
Like best buy gift cards, so we don't get our shit

16:37.960 --> 16:39.960
completely ripped off

16:41.560 --> 16:46.560
Hi, my name is Justin I'm calling for some personal information

16:50.920 --> 16:54.720
But I think there's I think this idea has got legs until of course

16:55.760 --> 16:56.880
Amanda

16:56.880 --> 17:02.560
Sends us on slack immediately after hearing this saying you can't do that. She won't even let us spin

17:02.560 --> 17:04.560
Oh, she probably will actually

17:04.680 --> 17:10.600
Amanda doesn't exactly work the way like real bosses do she'll probably force us to make the man. This is true

17:13.080 --> 17:16.040
Cop she is that prevents us from doing things

17:16.080 --> 17:21.040
She is the one that forces us to follow through on our dumb shit like smoking an entire card

17:21.040 --> 17:26.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, because sometimes like you mentioned goger in a show and a man is like

17:26.400 --> 17:29.240
Okay, send the runner to go get a box as a go-kart or whatever

17:30.240 --> 17:35.560
Go-kart on stage and that's why we hired her really we want the image

17:35.560 --> 17:40.200
We we basically we're like 13 year olds being babysat by a 14 year old. There's

17:41.600 --> 17:43.280
Illusion of

17:43.280 --> 17:48.700
Responsibility, but if an idea is good enough the 14 year olds like I mean, yeah, we can go but yeah

17:48.700 --> 17:55.480
What your friend has fireworks, I guess as long as they do it outside, right? That's what we that's what we're going for here

17:56.080 --> 18:03.720
I'm loving this. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'm also okay with posting it to tick-tock 30 seconds at a time

18:06.080 --> 18:08.080
Yeah, that'd be a hard to parse

18:08.240 --> 18:11.880
Popped up in your algo. Well what happens there because I don't know if you guys have ever seen this

18:11.880 --> 18:18.320
You can do that and it just says like part, you know, 18 or 400 and that you just have to have occasionally

18:18.840 --> 18:23.980
Like the the tick-tock voiceover bought pop in and be like the man hates the be

18:24.360 --> 18:27.720
Yeah, man, I'm sorry the statue trying to kill the be for some reason

18:30.400 --> 18:34.040
I'm betting there's a lot of scenes with no dialogue in it

18:34.040 --> 18:40.240
So I think we'll be cool sure as long as we do the dialogue ourselves and that is something we that's a remake we could

18:40.240 --> 18:42.180
We're gonna need a big costume

18:42.180 --> 18:49.000
Early. Yeah, or we could just make one out of like, you know the pipe cleaners and like pom-poms, right?

18:49.000 --> 18:51.040
And it's we just or you know what?

18:51.520 --> 18:57.720
We'll save money. We'll do it on a tennis ball right and paint it green and then we'll put the VFX in later, right?

19:01.360 --> 19:07.560
We take a tennis ball we paint black stripes on it. Oh, that's a be now that is now a be

19:07.560 --> 19:12.480
I guess it does depend on how much because we do have that one really emotive scene of the be

19:12.800 --> 19:15.920
Yeah, so I'll have to see once we watch the first episode now

19:15.920 --> 19:19.640
Listen, I got to tell everyone at home the turnaround time on this is not going to be fun

19:19.840 --> 19:24.840
right, it's gonna take us probably with the first episode comes out like three weeks and so then it will be

19:25.840 --> 19:31.560
Probably 2023 before we're able to release our we're gonna have to get it up within 24 hours

19:31.560 --> 19:35.800
I mean like Jesus. Yeah, it's got to be a quick if we teamed up

19:35.800 --> 19:40.380
With every animator we've ever worked. How long are these fucking episodes?

19:41.540 --> 19:43.540
16 hours. It's wild

19:50.940 --> 19:54.860
Alright shit. Okay. All right. It's gonna be tough

19:55.740 --> 20:02.580
Now but to be fair Griffin, it's 30 minutes of episode and then 15 and a half hours of black with just the question

20:02.580 --> 20:04.580
What do you think?

20:04.580 --> 20:06.900
I think that will be easy to handle

20:09.820 --> 20:12.340
14 hours will like to sign up for draft games

20:14.580 --> 20:17.260
Place your bets on man or be

20:19.380 --> 20:23.180
It is it is wild that they've decided to do each episode

20:23.620 --> 20:29.260
After the previous episode goes up and people vote for who they're rooting for and then they'll shoot the next episode

20:29.260 --> 20:33.220
But I do appreciate that that's a revolution in filmmaking. It can't be

20:33.220 --> 20:38.140
Can I change the subject? It can't be 10 episodes, right? It can't be

20:39.020 --> 20:42.180
Can't be how okay, so episode 10

20:42.780 --> 20:49.560
Can be like a reunion style like talking dead where they sit down with the B and with bean

20:49.740 --> 20:55.860
I'm betting episode 6 is like one of those like clip show episodes where it's him like remember

20:55.860 --> 21:01.580
Yeah from the first five episodes of like the times he almost got to be it's like a friend comes over and goes so wait

21:01.580 --> 21:07.420
Tell me again what happened and then we're just seeing that's what happens at the end of season episode 5

21:07.660 --> 21:09.180
Somebody's like coming what's been going on?

21:09.180 --> 21:15.220
So then the next five episodes are just a repeat of the first episodes with him occasionally reading

21:15.220 --> 21:21.940
So then I decided to it needs to be like walking dead is where if you leave the room to go get popcorn

21:21.940 --> 21:26.260
You come back and you're like, what the fuck is all this now? Who's that guy? Who's this guy with the bat?

21:26.340 --> 21:28.340
What's going on? Why is he so angry?

21:28.340 --> 21:32.940
We're the zombie angry. Why are there any zombies anymore? Who's pregnant with what now?

21:36.140 --> 21:40.660
Now we're talking I've reached the I've reached the limit. Okay

21:41.360 --> 21:45.080
We have to respect it. It's the closest we've got to a safe word

21:45.820 --> 21:47.820
We got to respect it

21:48.580 --> 21:52.980
Were you about to talk more about me versus be after I just established we do have to respect it

21:52.980 --> 21:58.460
I know but I okay. No Travis. You're right. You're right. You're right. We're done. Let's play the outro. Where are you?

21:59.660 --> 22:06.900
We need another clip of him just saying oh, there you are. That is that is the most primal it's amazing

22:07.340 --> 22:09.700
Okay, how is it ten episodes long?

22:09.700 --> 22:13.100
How is that not the last that has to be the last like?

22:13.740 --> 22:18.140
Okay, as long as Justin broke it. He has demonstrated. He should not take a child on holiday

22:18.140 --> 22:23.300
He is irresponsible. He is not he should not be allowed around other human beings. Let alone

22:23.820 --> 22:25.500
Okay, it's the B limit B limit

22:25.500 --> 22:32.460
My husband and I recently moved out of his grandmother's house where we've been living for the last two years without her knowledge

22:33.060 --> 22:39.140
She's a bit of a pack rat. So during our time there were we worked on cleaning out her basement a few months ago

22:39.140 --> 22:41.780
She mentioned trying to find some plastic wine glasses with grapes on them

22:41.780 --> 22:43.460
But they used to be in her basement

22:43.460 --> 22:47.020
The problem is we definitely threw those wine glasses out while we were cleaning

22:47.020 --> 22:52.540
She has since mentioned these glasses at least five times and said she wants to give them to us for use by our new pool

22:53.020 --> 22:54.780
Brothers, what do we do?

22:54.780 --> 22:59.020
Do we fess up to having tossed the glasses every time she asked about them?

22:59.020 --> 23:05.460
We say hmm number seeing them maybe they're in the attic. She searched the basement multiple times looking for them. Help us brothers

23:05.460 --> 23:12.380
Oh, well, it's from spring cleaning in South Jersey. How old is she? She's looking around the basement looking for the glasses like

23:12.380 --> 23:17.020
Oh, we're gonna get a lot of mileage out of that one, huh?

23:18.620 --> 23:20.940
How old is grandma I might not be a problem

23:22.660 --> 23:24.660
Patrick mackerel

23:25.420 --> 23:27.780
Talk like that. We don't talk like that

23:28.540 --> 23:31.100
Could you come up with the promise is plastic?

23:31.100 --> 23:36.460
But if you could come up with an undeniable reason for what like oh they were covered in mold, right?

23:36.460 --> 23:39.220
That's always the leak and that's not gonna work. It's plastic, right?

23:39.220 --> 23:42.500
What if you can come up with a reason of like, oh, yeah

23:42.500 --> 23:49.220
I saw those they're cursed or whatever like I don't know what works with plastic. You can't the problem is

23:49.700 --> 23:56.500
You I was on board with you Trav and trying to have a little bit of harmless fun. Uh-huh until I read the line

23:57.420 --> 24:00.900
She searched the basement multiple times. Oh, yeah. No, it's too late now

24:00.900 --> 24:07.380
It's too late now to do anything where you have had any knowledge that you did not share with your old grandmother

24:07.380 --> 24:12.540
Correct, because it's mean. Yeah, it's mean now to not share to cut to reveal it

24:12.540 --> 24:16.260
Later would be to especially since it's a very specific

24:16.860 --> 24:23.900
Ask like yeah plastic wine glasses with grapes on them. That's not like oh the plastic wine glasses with grapes

24:23.900 --> 24:27.020
You can't do the fake realization later. That was so specific

24:27.260 --> 24:32.180
now if you ever if anyone at home ever runs in this to into this again, it's too late for them, but

24:32.740 --> 24:36.500
Say they were broken and you threw them away or that you broke them and threw them away

24:36.500 --> 24:43.260
Because the thing being broken that's accidental and they're gonna be upset about it, but they're gonna be upset that it happened

24:43.260 --> 24:47.380
But if you're like, oh I looked at those perfectly good plastic wine glasses with grapes on them

24:47.380 --> 24:52.100
And I said this is garbage now. Yeah, that's a choice you made and I hit you all with another idea

24:52.860 --> 24:57.080
Okay, she comes to you. She says where's those wine glasses with grapes on them?

24:57.080 --> 24:59.180
I it was going to be a very special gift

24:59.180 --> 25:02.980
it was a special gift for me and I want to make it a special gift for you for the pool times and

25:02.980 --> 25:08.620
You look down and you look really guilty and say nothing and then grandma's gonna be like

25:09.020 --> 25:13.340
You need to tell me now what has happened and you just look up and you say we

25:14.080 --> 25:19.220
We antiques road showed it and oh you did what and be like I took it

25:19.220 --> 25:24.380
I antiques road show cuz I thought it'd be worth a lot of money and they took it and I sold it and they only

25:24.380 --> 25:28.380
Do five dollars and then you give your grandma five dollars

25:28.380 --> 25:33.020
Now Griffin, have you watched your antiques road show because that's not how that works

25:33.340 --> 25:37.660
You don't hand it to them and they say okay. Let me see what I can get for it. I'll be right back

25:38.940 --> 25:43.740
They're like this is worthless, but I do want I'm so I'll give you five bucks for right now you walk away

25:44.420 --> 25:49.380
One half of the convention center that's for the shit and the other half for people looking to buy shit

25:49.380 --> 25:55.980
They're like, okay. Hold on one second. What's this? It's a tiny porcelain unicorn one second. Okay, I got a tiny porcelain unicorn here

25:55.980 --> 26:02.780
For me you give me 15 bucks great. Hey, it's worth 15 bucks. It's worth whatever someone's willing to pay for

26:02.780 --> 26:07.620
I thought you're gonna go with our grandma bad news. I sold the pool to buy you these new glasses

26:08.300 --> 26:10.300
But then you don't have the glasses

26:12.340 --> 26:18.140
No, I sold the glasses so we can have enough money to move out right there that deck you're standing on that's the glasses

26:18.140 --> 26:23.820
That's that door you opened. That's the glasses the couch. That's the glasses. It's every search up

26:23.820 --> 26:31.540
You know if you go I'm looking right now on on on Etsy at four plastic wine glasses with great detail

26:32.340 --> 26:39.300
How much girl they're 40 bucks and that's probably I mean, that's not great, but you fuck living there

26:39.300 --> 26:43.380
That's the panel fucked up. You've been living there rent-free. I'm not saying you try to replace them

26:43.380 --> 26:50.620
I'm saying you say I think it's very sad. You can't find these glasses that you want not a lie. That's accurate

26:50.620 --> 26:53.820
Yeah, you know to try to cheer you up. We bought some new

26:54.460 --> 27:01.100
Some new ones to replace them. Yes. Oh damn, but she's gonna give them to you. Okay, okay

27:01.100 --> 27:04.420
That doesn't even make sense what I just here. Let me try this. Let me try this

27:05.060 --> 27:08.300
Hey, I really appreciate the thoughtfulness and looking for the glasses

27:08.460 --> 27:11.940
But the time spent looking for those glasses could be time

27:11.940 --> 27:16.740
We're spending together and that's way more worthwhile to me need to let the glasses go

27:16.740 --> 27:20.420
Thank you so much grandma for working on the glasses, but you know what?

27:20.420 --> 27:25.780
I'd rather just spend that time with you while we have it left because grandma you're getting old travel. Okay. No way

27:25.780 --> 27:32.700
Yeah, sorry. Sorry. No, she doesn't need that stress. Oh, she doesn't need the stress. Hey, can we said can we heal the wizard?

27:36.220 --> 27:44.280
Okay starting it this is a cool one it was sent in by Adrian Cowles back in the fucking game Adrian welcome back

27:44.280 --> 27:48.880
I haven't heard their name

27:50.760 --> 27:57.360
Asian cows been dead long on for a year. You haven't been around the cows, please. Have you I wouldn't

27:58.360 --> 28:00.360
Listen

28:02.360 --> 28:04.360
By the side of the road you say

28:05.920 --> 28:10.840
When the moon she was fully oh, no, I wouldn't stop for nothing

28:10.840 --> 28:15.920
All right, so they're not lonely stretch a road out behind the podcast

28:16.560 --> 28:23.920
No, no, no ever. No one ever goes back there. Can we it's an old saloon where we make the podcast and we be serious now

28:24.400 --> 28:30.400
Sure, that's my favorite line from the movie. Sully starring Tom Hanks. Hey, can we stop farting around man?

28:30.400 --> 28:34.360
You hate those words and I gotta fix it. I could quote it. What's your favorite Sully?

28:34.360 --> 28:41.280
The one where it's like they're like doing the trial for Sully this movie beats ass and then they're like

28:41.280 --> 28:44.720
and so you should have known you could have made it to the runway and

28:45.000 --> 28:48.960
They give him a real hard time in the whole time. So he's just sitting there like mm-hmm

28:49.040 --> 28:51.800
Mm-hmm, and then after they finish giving him a shit time

28:51.800 --> 28:56.920
He looks up and he's like can we be serious now? It's like oh you took my breath away

28:56.920 --> 28:59.360
Tom Hanks Sully Sully for a second

28:59.360 --> 29:05.720
I thought you we're gonna say that the quote was this movie beats ass and just in the middle of Sully Tom Hanks breaks character

29:05.720 --> 29:11.080
It looks at the camera. It's just like this movie beats race your asses. I'm about to drop a dope one

29:11.520 --> 29:15.880
this is a dual engine loss at 2800 feet followed by immediate water landing with

29:17.320 --> 29:19.880
155 souls on board. Yeah, you can't

29:21.680 --> 29:23.840
One so dope anyway

29:25.240 --> 29:27.240
Yeah, okay, so that's my favorite

29:27.240 --> 29:31.920
156 and here is a question or a wiki house ended by a drink house. Thank you

29:31.920 --> 29:38.360
It is how to build a memory palace. Thank you. He really does say can we get serious now? Yeah, I know

29:39.720 --> 29:41.720
How many times have you seen Sully?

29:42.600 --> 29:46.200
It's amazing. I've never seen it. Is it good? Are you kidding me?

29:47.280 --> 29:51.160
Podcast over movie. Sorry guys. I'm busy Travis Travis

29:51.660 --> 29:54.120
155 souls no one's ever prepared for anything like that

29:54.120 --> 30:01.200
155 souls like 30 geese. I saw him get a shuttle back to earth. I don't care about a plane

30:01.600 --> 30:07.280
Okay. All right. So anyway, just a man. It's just he's just a man doing his job Sully. Yeah

30:07.280 --> 30:11.920
People do their jobs all the time. I'm gonna tell I'm gonna tell Griffin David. You haven't seen Sully

30:11.920 --> 30:16.560
They're gonna fucking flip out. There's a lot of movies. I haven't seen that they like. Yeah, but this one's Sully

30:16.560 --> 30:22.000
This is Sully. It's a big Sully. I'm not saying I'm unsullied Travis. Can we be serious now? Yes

30:22.000 --> 30:28.160
Okay, one of the most useful memories one of the most useful memory aids was created thousands of years ago by the ancient Greeks and the

30:28.160 --> 30:33.760
Memory palace and the memory palace a place in your mind where you can store information that you need to remember is still relevant today

30:33.760 --> 30:37.100
It's not it's used not only by world record-holding memory champions

30:37.100 --> 30:43.360
But also by famous detective Sherlock Holmes with a little pan and Patrick Jane on the mentalist by the way, and the mentalist

30:43.360 --> 30:45.360
Yes

30:45.360 --> 30:52.440
I can bring up the mentalist for a reason and not just

30:54.440 --> 30:57.480
Great references to it. I'm halfway through season five guys

30:57.480 --> 31:02.160
It fucking kicks ass with a little planning and practice you can build a memory palace, too

31:02.240 --> 31:04.880
So Justin has a memory palace. Did you juice?

31:05.600 --> 31:10.640
Yeah, what's it like? Hey, don't be humble man. This is a skill that you have. I want to hear about it

31:10.640 --> 31:16.120
What kind of let's okay. Why don't we go through the steps and you tell me like how you did your little sick fucking?

31:16.120 --> 31:17.720
Twisted spin on it. Okay

31:17.720 --> 31:21.240
So method one planning your palace choose a place that can be easily

31:21.560 --> 31:26.800
Visualized as the blueprint for your palace a memory palace must be a place or route that you are incredibly familiar with like your childhood

31:26.800 --> 31:31.680
Home or even your daily commute to work it can be as small as your closet or as large as your entire neighborhood the important things

31:31.680 --> 31:35.180
That you're able to visualize the place in your head without actually seeing it in real life. What'd you go with juice?

31:35.180 --> 31:43.020
I did the Marshall University Theatre because I spent so much time there in college and growing up that I thought that it would be

31:43.620 --> 31:45.620
good

31:45.660 --> 31:47.660
That's good. That's good

31:47.740 --> 31:48.900
J-man

31:48.900 --> 31:55.580
You can be serious. Can we be serious now? You can't be serious serious now Travis. Don't you fucking come here and quote?

31:55.580 --> 32:04.020
Well, now I feel like I've seen it. Here's the problem guys. It's like I already know what happened. So like spoilers. Yeah, I would say

32:04.020 --> 32:11.100
Using this metric place that can be easily visualized and I'm like incredibly familiar. I would have to say the gym like the weights

32:11.900 --> 32:18.100
The weight bench lifting area of the gym. See for me, I think it's it's probably you don't let me finish

32:18.100 --> 32:22.740
Oh good. Go ahead. I'm just saying the grit of the bar. Yeah, the gym. Yeah the feel

32:22.740 --> 32:28.160
Okay, this is the way on your fingers wet on the leather. Yeah, I can put a lot of memories into that

32:28.380 --> 32:31.940
Yeah, mine's gonna be probably the Jimmy John's I worked out at six months

32:33.020 --> 32:36.740
Probably like just the condiment bar just the topping bar. Yeah

32:37.180 --> 32:40.820
So now to be fair, I never made a single sandwich in the entire six months

32:40.820 --> 32:41.360
I was there

32:41.360 --> 32:46.140
Yeah, because I just kept saying I don't know how to do it and they would say like well, there's no time to train you

32:46.140 --> 32:50.140
So go work the register. What's this in the lettuce? It's all the state capitals, right?

32:50.140 --> 32:56.880
Excellent. Excellent. Let me get a sandwich with all the state capitals and the lyrics to every Bruno Mars song. Thank you delicious

32:57.420 --> 32:59.420
Walk through your palace to define a route

32:59.420 --> 33:03.420
Decide how you'll travel through the palace in your mind rather than just picturing a fixed place for example

33:03.420 --> 33:06.620
Instead of just imagining your house imagine how you'd walk through it. Do you enter through the front door?

33:06.620 --> 33:08.300
What hallway do you walk down?

33:08.300 --> 33:13.420
Begin to practice your route now will make it easier to later memorize later on too. Okay

33:14.140 --> 33:16.980
Between all the different weight benches the turbo flex

33:16.980 --> 33:23.020
The super flex there's not a lot of great ways to name I'm gonna use a bow flex

33:23.580 --> 33:25.580
No, they don't do those anymore

33:26.340 --> 33:28.260
Not after the accident

33:28.260 --> 33:32.140
Little sorry at the gym I go to little boy came in try to do the bow flex

33:32.140 --> 33:34.140
But then it shot him through the ceiling

33:34.780 --> 33:38.780
Beautiful arrow. Can I tell you the catch-22 the problem here the irony?

33:38.900 --> 33:43.460
Yeah, I want to create a memory palace, but I can't remember any location well enough to do it

33:43.460 --> 33:47.700
Well, that's yeah, I mean that's can you gosh?

33:48.140 --> 33:54.180
Can you do a place you kind of remember to create a better memory for your prime?

33:54.700 --> 33:59.820
Location, you know, maybe if I do a small location like a bathroom, right? My favorite bathroom

33:59.900 --> 34:05.840
Yeah, I choose to use whenever possible and that is the memory palace for creating my memory

34:06.740 --> 34:08.900
timeshare for your main place

34:08.900 --> 34:15.980
Yeah, that can be cool. I used I used the theater department to learn all to remember all Shakespeare's place and

34:16.340 --> 34:21.500
And you'd be shocked at how rarely that skill is really that that useful

34:21.540 --> 34:24.280
Can you name them now just use that skill now?

34:24.700 --> 34:26.880
So I would you I would close your eyes

34:28.660 --> 34:31.660
You know when you walk in on the dock the loading dock

34:31.660 --> 34:34.780
Yeah, the loading dock right after his entrance the crew entrance

34:34.780 --> 34:41.380
Yes, either go through the crew entrance and there's two guys that are holding up flags greeting you as you go up the ramp

34:41.380 --> 34:44.260
There's the two gentlemen front. Okay, because it flags up easy

34:44.260 --> 34:48.660
Okay, and then you go up and you're scared when you're on the ramp because there's a little mouse there

34:48.660 --> 34:50.660
Mmm, and I'm like, oh that's a mouse hunt

34:50.860 --> 34:54.300
That's taming the show. So it's a little mouse there. I'm not a shrew

34:54.300 --> 34:58.860
Okay, go on now and then that also only works for you because you're afraid of mice and sons

34:58.860 --> 35:06.020
I'd see that mouse and be like what a great day. Oh mouse on us. And then there's three of Griffin's sons. They're greeting

35:06.020 --> 35:08.020
That's my three sons have of

35:08.460 --> 35:10.460
six on their shirt

35:10.460 --> 35:12.460
Cuz that's Henry the sixth

35:13.060 --> 35:18.100
Part two three. This isn't as funny as I thought it would be and then who's that greeting you on the deck?

35:18.100 --> 35:20.100
It's well, it's Titus Burgess

35:20.580 --> 35:22.680
He's he's welcoming me in

35:22.680 --> 35:28.480
That one doesn't that one doesn't feel specific to the theater because I don't think Titus Burgess ever spent time

35:28.760 --> 35:33.000
It's it also well, it's just it doesn't it doesn't have to be specific to the theater

35:33.000 --> 35:38.400
Yeah, so like you open the door and there's Al Pacino playing Richard the third and he's and he's behind that

35:38.400 --> 35:43.520
So I'm gonna here's me walking up the ramp to your theater department and I look at the dock

35:43.760 --> 35:47.300
That the loading dock here entrance and there's just like

35:47.920 --> 35:50.600
There's just like 30 dudes. Yeah

35:50.600 --> 35:55.920
And some are holding flags and some look like my children Titus Burgess is there which is exciting

35:56.360 --> 36:00.160
There's just like a bunch of dudes here and you look at that and be like, ah, yes

36:00.160 --> 36:02.760
All my favorite Shakespeare guys here Justin

36:02.760 --> 36:05.680
Can I can I make a small addendum that I think might make this easier?

36:05.680 --> 36:09.640
It might be way too late to adjust Justin's college. Well, you walk into the building, right?

36:09.640 --> 36:21.360
And there's a guy holding 38 books and each of the books is one of Shakespeare's plays and you can read the title on the spine

36:21.600 --> 36:26.640
Juice you haven't I imagine use this information a while and maybe you haven't visited the memory palace

36:26.640 --> 36:28.780
Is it all covered in cobwebs and skeletons now?

36:30.040 --> 36:34.320
Somebody else move in and they're like, oh, sorry. I thought I thought you'd like I know

36:34.320 --> 36:39.560
I sometimes it does get a little sticky because I know Titus Burgess is in there somewhere

36:39.560 --> 36:43.160
But sometimes I can't I can't finally find him. I'm like

36:47.160 --> 36:54.560
Hey guys, did we forget to go to the money zone how far past oh shit Griffin, I'm sorry memory palace. We gotta keep yeah, right

36:56.040 --> 36:58.320
Identify specific that we had advertorial

36:58.320 --> 37:00.320
I

37:05.400 --> 37:06.960
Promoting

37:06.960 --> 37:12.000
Ripping off Netflix en masse on such a like a grand scale could be hey guys

37:13.080 --> 37:20.840
We did have a couple complaints from advertisers specifically Netflix. Um, let me see here who has not advertised

37:22.240 --> 37:24.640
They called just to say they never ever would

37:24.640 --> 37:28.320
Never yeah, so identify specific locations in the palace to store your information

37:28.600 --> 37:32.720
Think about exactly what you're gonna be putting in your memory palace whether it's a number name or important dates

37:32.720 --> 37:35.800
You need to remember for an exam. You'll story arcade games

37:36.640 --> 37:42.080
You why would you ever need that? Well, I'm imagining it. I've always wanted arcade games in my house

37:42.320 --> 37:45.240
Okay, you'll store each piece of data in a separate location

37:45.240 --> 37:51.000
So you need to identify as many locations as you have data each storage spot needs to be unique so that you don't accidentally mistake

37:51.000 --> 37:55.440
One spot for another Justin. I can't tell if this is an extended bit or not you having a memory palace

37:55.920 --> 37:57.920
It's real. No, it's not a bit

37:58.240 --> 38:01.320
Travis brought it up. That would be a while. Yeah, that's a cold shot

38:01.320 --> 38:04.480
So do you like walk into that you turn to the right as you walk into the theater department?

38:04.480 --> 38:10.480
there's that little kitchen green room chill spot you open up the silverware drawer and then there's

38:10.960 --> 38:13.800
You know and there's just like a you know

38:14.520 --> 38:17.040
Well, I can't think of a single. I can't think of us

38:17.040 --> 38:22.160
There's a big plate of ham when you go into the green room. Yeah, there's a bunch of people falling all over themselves

38:22.320 --> 38:25.760
And like spilling things and it's just a huge mess comedy of air

38:25.760 --> 38:30.380
That's calm. Thank you, and I shut the door right away cuz it's like whoa, I'm silly that yeah

38:31.000 --> 38:38.580
Okay, and then you then you eat a big piece of ham, right? I just Beth did this article was a lot sillier to me

38:39.360 --> 38:43.360
Before I knew that it was a thing Justin actually did now you feel bad

38:43.360 --> 38:50.560
I mean, this is it's hard is this is a technique. This is a real you're stumbled on is the first might I say?

38:51.200 --> 38:54.800
useful wizard of the cloud useful in so much as

38:55.600 --> 39:00.920
It is useful to remember all the plays that will shake your or state capitals

39:00.920 --> 39:05.680
I assume I haven't done that right but like imagine if I had that one's easy

39:05.680 --> 39:09.640
You just imagine yourself walking on to America in Maine

39:09.640 --> 39:17.640
Yeah, and then you just go kind of zigzag around there and I'm like, okay main that's and then I would say whatever it is

39:18.200 --> 39:20.200
but you have to explore your

39:21.640 --> 39:23.640
contiguous United States

39:23.760 --> 39:29.160
Memory palace in real time. So people be like, so what's the what's the capital of Vermont?

39:29.160 --> 39:35.320
You like fucking hold on Montpelier. There's it. Well, hold on. I gotta get on a train

39:35.320 --> 39:39.400
It's gonna take me like three and a half hours to tell you what the capital of Vermont is

39:41.080 --> 39:43.080
Ask me again tomorrow

39:44.480 --> 39:50.000
Practice vision. I'll have three or four of them by that. Definitely. Uh, yeah, I don't want to do the rest of this

39:50.000 --> 39:51.800
I don't think

39:51.800 --> 39:53.800
Let's go the money zone

39:53.800 --> 39:56.880
You got a food. Okay, you look at yeah yummy

39:58.040 --> 40:02.560
But wait before you ate it. Did you look and say whoa, this is a little bit imperfect

40:02.560 --> 40:04.800
I would never say that I'm not allowed look

40:05.480 --> 40:11.640
Then you look at the hand holding it and you see some small lines of a and you're the cousin and a stray hairs

40:11.640 --> 40:15.040
And then it's like, you know what? Maybe I'm imperfect too. You know what I mean?

40:15.040 --> 40:19.040
I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect

40:19.040 --> 40:23.040
I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect

40:23.040 --> 40:26.780
You know what? I mean? Like aren't we all imperfect and shouldn't we be seeking that out? Not me

40:29.160 --> 40:34.160

Crunchy if they're supposed to be you know, or sweet if they're supposed to be what if that's the imperfection?

Do you guys ever think about like in the grand scheme of things if there's a multiverse and every decision in action?

42:01.660 --> 42:05.800
We've ever taken branches into you know different possibilities that

42:05.800 --> 42:12.160
Somewhere that there is like a perfect version of yourself and maybe it's not that you've made every decision perfectly

42:12.160 --> 42:18.720
But rather that the decisions you've made and the choices you've made have led to what is the ideal version of yourself?

42:18.720 --> 42:21.920
And then you think I think that's me. I think I've done it

42:22.240 --> 42:27.080

What did the first thing? Why what did the first thing have to do? Oh, it's not connected at all

42:39.040 --> 42:44.720
It's just a thought that I had in my brain about myself that I really wanted to share because Justin mentioned being imperfect

42:44.720 --> 42:48.540
I don't think I am so babble is great because it's like, you know

42:48.540 --> 42:52.280

42:59.960 --> 43:03.920
I mean that is how oh, you know, the the ever-expanding universe works

43:03.920 --> 43:06.160
We are getting bigger in real time

Hi, I'm Dan McCoy, I'm Stuart Wellington and I'm Elliot Kalin and the three of us host the flop house

44:07.340 --> 44:10.900
It's a podcast where we watch a new bad movie and then we talk about it

44:10.900 --> 44:12.540
Dan you say it's hosted by the three of us

44:12.540 --> 44:15.860
We've had a lot of great guest co-hosts like Gillian Flynn Jamel Bowie

44:15.860 --> 44:20.420
John Hodgman, Jessica Williams, Wyatt Sinak, Joe Bob Briggs, Josh Gondelman, Roman Mars

44:20.420 --> 44:25.180
Yeah, and you said new movies, but what about the time we didn't meatballs too? Okay. Okay

44:25.180 --> 44:28.340
Yeah, sometimes we do older movies and sometimes we have guests

44:28.340 --> 44:33.460
But mostly it's about us talking about like recent bad movies and don't forget about the ones where I made you do a role-playing game

44:33.460 --> 44:39.040
Where you played cartoon dogs? All right. Yeah, shouldn't a promo be a really simple explanation about what our show is about

44:39.040 --> 44:43.860
So what's the show about Dan? What's it about? What's it about? It's about friendship. All right

44:43.860 --> 44:46.640
It's about our friendship and how we love each other the flop house

44:46.640 --> 44:49.620
It's a podcast mostly about bad movies on maximum fun

44:53.220 --> 44:57.340
Do you sometimes wonder whatever happened to the kids at your school who really loved Star Trek

44:57.360 --> 45:02.720
You might remember a kid like me the one who read the Star Trek novels and built starship models

45:02.720 --> 45:09.340
I also took music classes to avoid taking gym classes that required showering after but I don't see what that really has to do with

45:09.340 --> 45:13.980
Or a kid like me. I introduced myself to kids at my summer camp one year as Wesley

45:13.980 --> 45:17.020
But when the school year started and some of those kids were in my new class

45:17.020 --> 45:22.740
I actually had to explain to my friends that I had tried to take on the identity of my favorite Star Trek character

45:22.740 --> 45:29.140
The shame haunts me to this day. I'm sure some of those Star Trek fans from your childhood grew up to have interesting and productive

45:29.940 --> 45:34.920
Lives, but we ended up being podcasters on the greatest discovery

45:34.920 --> 45:39.620
You'll hear what happens to to lifelong Star Trek fans who didn't grow up to be great people

45:39.620 --> 45:42.780
It just grew up to be people who have jokes as much as they love Trek

45:42.780 --> 45:49.180

45:53.260 --> 46:00.560
Diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy. Sorry diggy diggy diggy. I want a munch

46:00.560 --> 46:01.560
I want a munch.

46:01.560 --> 46:02.560
Buh buh buh buh buh.

46:02.560 --> 46:03.560
Bebebibebebe.

46:03.560 --> 46:04.860
I want a munch.

46:04.860 --> 46:05.860
BAD!

46:05.860 --> 46:07.500
Buh buh buh buh buh.

46:07.500 --> 46:10.660
Bah bah bah ba bah bah bah bah.

46:10.660 --> 46:11.660
Bieber.

46:11.660 --> 46:12.660
Yes?

46:12.660 --> 46:13.660
What?

46:13.660 --> 46:14.660
He's back.

46:14.660 --> 46:15.660
Bieber's back?

46:15.660 --> 46:16.660
Where'd he go?

46:16.660 --> 46:18.100
Bieber's back in Big Way.

46:18.100 --> 46:20.600
With a new Tim Hortons collab.

46:20.600 --> 46:26.240
Wait, is, is it- I thought there was still a Tim Hortons Bieber collab going on?

46:26.240 --> 46:27.840
It's back, baby.

46:27.840 --> 46:29.360
It was a limited time offer.

46:29.360 --> 46:31.120
Tim Biebs are gone.

46:31.120 --> 46:32.160
They're a thing of the past.

46:32.160 --> 46:33.480
You know how you've been missing them

46:33.480 --> 46:34.720
and can't find them lately?

46:34.720 --> 46:35.600
That's because they're gone.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.720
When did they go away?

46:36.720 --> 46:39.640
I feel like we just talked about it like three weeks ago.

46:39.640 --> 46:43.000
The first part of the Tim's X Justin Bieber collab

46:43.000 --> 46:45.360
was focused on Justin putting his own spin

46:45.360 --> 46:47.120
on his favorite treats at Tim Horton's

46:47.120 --> 46:49.000
Bite Size Tim Bits Donuts.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.520
For the second collab,

46:50.520 --> 46:54.080
Justin and Tim's decided to develop a new twist

46:54.080 --> 46:56.540
on what the iconic brand is best known for,

46:56.540 --> 46:58.660
brewing the perfect cup of coffee.

46:58.660 --> 47:00.100
Can I tell you guys something?

47:00.100 --> 47:01.340
I'm starting to suspect,

47:01.340 --> 47:06.340
and I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theory person

47:06.420 --> 47:08.140
here, but I'm starting to suspect

47:08.140 --> 47:11.820
that this is actually not born out of a shared love

47:11.820 --> 47:15.580
and respect between Justin Bieber and Tim Horton's,

47:15.580 --> 47:18.580
but rather some kind of money-making scheme.

47:18.580 --> 47:20.340
You sound, can I say, Travis,

47:20.340 --> 47:21.940
I'm gonna try to put this kindly,

47:21.940 --> 47:23.660
you sound so fucking stupid right now.

47:23.660 --> 47:25.780
You haven't even heard what he's done.

47:25.780 --> 47:28.620
And you're immediately, you are shitting on it.

47:28.620 --> 47:31.180
I'm just saying that it's possible money changed hands.

47:31.180 --> 47:34.140
Okay, I'm gonna take you, Travis, into the process.

47:34.140 --> 47:35.060
Okay.

47:35.060 --> 47:36.420
That's what I'm gonna do.

47:36.420 --> 47:38.820
Yeah, open my, please, I would love to be proven wrong.

47:38.820 --> 47:41.740
In product brainstorms,

47:41.740 --> 47:43.540
that's what you do when you're working,

47:43.540 --> 47:45.820
with the Tim's team, Justin shared

47:45.820 --> 47:49.300
that he prefers his coffee on ice,

47:49.300 --> 47:52.220
which led to working on a new flavor

47:52.220 --> 47:54.780
of Tim Horton's cold brew.

47:54.780 --> 47:57.340
Also inspired by a slight sweet tooth

47:57.340 --> 47:58.820
and his love for hints of delicious flavoring.

47:58.820 --> 48:00.940
Nothing crazy, nothing crazy.

48:00.940 --> 48:04.220
A slight sweet tooth and his love

48:04.220 --> 48:07.620
for hints of delicious vanilla flavoring in his coffee.

48:07.620 --> 48:09.460
This is very specific, I mean, I'll give you this.

48:09.460 --> 48:10.740
It's very specific.

48:10.740 --> 48:12.900
Don't put too much vanilla on fucking peach.

48:12.900 --> 48:14.420
No, I just wanted you to feel

48:14.420 --> 48:17.580
like the coffee walked by a vanilla factory.

48:17.580 --> 48:19.180
I have always liked vanilla.

48:19.180 --> 48:21.660
We couldn't stop at Tim Biebs.

48:22.820 --> 48:24.300
We needed a Biebs brew too.

48:24.300 --> 48:27.740
This is my, this is my Biebs voice, by the way.

48:27.740 --> 48:29.660
We couldn't stop at Tim Biebs.

48:29.660 --> 48:31.940
We needed a Biebs brew too.

48:31.940 --> 48:34.700
And we're bringing both to Tim's next month.

48:34.700 --> 48:36.340
What, both?

48:36.340 --> 48:37.180
This is a long way down.

48:37.180 --> 48:40.500
Doing a Tim Horton's collab has always been a dream of mine.

48:40.500 --> 48:43.380
Now I do have to say, you said that last time

48:43.380 --> 48:45.020
and that dream has been realized.

48:45.020 --> 48:46.860
Maybe leave a little dream fruit on the tree

48:46.860 --> 48:47.700
for the rest of the Biebs.

48:47.700 --> 48:49.340
No, Justin, here's the problem, right?

48:49.340 --> 48:50.300
He got that and he was like,

48:50.300 --> 48:52.420
why don't I feel anything inside?

48:52.420 --> 48:54.260
Maybe it's because I need more collab.

48:54.260 --> 48:56.620
I would say fucking Tim, watch the throne.

48:56.620 --> 49:00.020
I think Biebs is like slowly taking over from the inside.

49:00.020 --> 49:03.340
This whole Tim Biebs thing is a fucking Trojan horse.

49:03.340 --> 49:04.460
And eventually he's going to be like,

49:04.460 --> 49:07.180
for my next collab, we're changing it to Bieb Hortons

49:07.180 --> 49:08.020
or whatever.

49:08.020 --> 49:09.860
And then pretty soon it's just called Bieber.

49:09.860 --> 49:12.060
This is just like Shaq. Shaq is Papa John's.

49:12.060 --> 49:13.580
Yes. Yes.

49:13.580 --> 49:16.460
Pretty soon Justin Bieber is going to plant a phone call

49:16.460 --> 49:18.740
where Tim Horton said the N word.

49:18.740 --> 49:21.580
I don't think that's gonna happen.

49:21.580 --> 49:26.540
Do you remember when Shaq ran a disinformation campaign

49:26.540 --> 49:28.580
against Papa John?

49:28.580 --> 49:30.500
What are you on about?

49:30.500 --> 49:32.180
You absolute maniac.

49:32.180 --> 49:34.940
You can't impugn the character of Shaq

49:34.940 --> 49:37.460
while un-impugning the character of Papa John.

49:37.460 --> 49:39.420
It's the only thing that makes sense.

49:39.420 --> 49:40.260
No, it's not.

49:40.260 --> 49:42.740
Have you seen his giant eagle statue

49:42.740 --> 49:44.900
of the eagles committing coitus in midair?

49:44.900 --> 49:46.900
How could someone with a giant eagle statue

49:46.900 --> 49:48.260
be a racist man?

49:48.260 --> 49:53.260
I can't believe Shaq did that.

49:55.860 --> 49:56.940
He didn't do it.

49:56.940 --> 49:58.500
I want to be clear.

49:59.940 --> 50:02.420
All three Tim Bieb's flavors,

50:02.420 --> 50:04.980
chocolate white fudge, sour cream chocolate chip

50:04.980 --> 50:05.860
and birthday cake.

50:05.860 --> 50:06.860
You know them already.

50:06.860 --> 50:07.820
You don't need me to do that.

50:07.820 --> 50:09.100
Birthday cake waffle.

50:09.100 --> 50:11.380
You've got them tattooed on your arm.

50:11.380 --> 50:12.220
We get it.

50:12.220 --> 50:14.820
They're all returning to Tim's restaurants in Canada

50:14.820 --> 50:17.820
and the United States along with Bieb's brew

50:17.820 --> 50:18.940
on June 6th.

50:18.940 --> 50:19.780
Hell yeah.

50:19.780 --> 50:20.620
You can get it.

50:20.620 --> 50:21.820
If you're in the US,

50:21.820 --> 50:25.060
guests can get a $5 Bieb's bundle,

50:25.060 --> 50:27.140
which is a large Bieb's brew

50:27.140 --> 50:29.820
and a Tim pack of Tim Bieb's for $5.

50:29.820 --> 50:31.260
This has gotten a little distinct.

50:31.260 --> 50:34.580
There could have been more Bieb's in there.

50:34.580 --> 50:36.140
Like you're filling up your car

50:36.140 --> 50:39.340
and it's like, I'm gonna need 10 gallons of Bieb's juices

50:39.340 --> 50:40.180
for my car.

50:40.180 --> 50:42.340
Is that Bieb's or un-Bieb'd?

50:42.340 --> 50:43.460
You want it un-Bieb'd?

50:43.460 --> 50:45.180
Is that un-Bieb'd?

50:45.180 --> 50:46.780
You want it un-Bieb'd or un-Bieb'd?

50:46.780 --> 50:49.500
If you put some Bieb's into the radiator too,

50:49.500 --> 50:51.940
wait, sorry, I'm so fucking confused.

50:51.940 --> 50:54.540
We have Beebium, but it's gonna run you a few bucks more.

50:54.540 --> 50:56.580
Un-Bieb'd or un-Bieb'd?

50:56.580 --> 50:58.940
Are we talking Bieb's bucks or cryptocurrency?

51:02.940 --> 51:03.780
Those are the only two things left.

51:03.780 --> 51:04.620
He doesn't have an NFT,

51:04.620 --> 51:06.740
he just has the USD is replaced by-

51:06.740 --> 51:08.540
Yeah, that's the only thing we have left.

51:08.540 --> 51:09.380
Okay.

51:09.380 --> 51:11.300
It's the year 2020 Bieb's.

51:11.300 --> 51:14.340
They have merchandise and I need all of it.

51:14.340 --> 51:16.940
There's a beanie, a fanny pack, a tote bag

51:16.940 --> 51:19.420
that were developed in collaboration with Justin,

51:19.420 --> 51:21.020
which means they held up a picture of it

51:21.020 --> 51:21.980
and he said, yeah, fine.

51:21.980 --> 51:24.860
No, he tested, he took that tote bag to the farmer's market

51:24.860 --> 51:27.180
and he's like, this isn't holding all my rutabagas.

51:27.180 --> 51:29.900
I said 18 rutabagas, Tim.

51:29.900 --> 51:34.020
When guests buy any Tim's X Justin Bieber merch,

51:34.020 --> 51:36.300
they get 50% off a second item.

51:36.300 --> 51:38.940
How's your markup doing?

51:38.940 --> 51:39.900
It seems pretty good.

51:39.900 --> 51:41.660
They're doing it at a loss, man.

51:41.660 --> 51:44.100
Bieb's is paying out of pocket.

51:44.100 --> 51:47.820
Tim Bieb's was a huge success,

51:47.820 --> 51:51.100
truly beyond all our expectations.

51:51.100 --> 51:52.660
And what makes it so great

51:52.660 --> 51:55.380
was the authenticity of the partnership track.

51:55.380 --> 51:57.340
That's according to Hope Bugazzi,

51:57.340 --> 51:59.820
the chief marketing officer for Tim Hortons.

51:59.820 --> 52:02.380
Even before the Tim Bieb's collaboration,

52:02.380 --> 52:05.620
which they're still sounding very defensive about this,

52:05.620 --> 52:08.180
Justin had often shared with his fans

52:08.180 --> 52:09.620
how he'd grown up on Tim Hortons,

52:09.620 --> 52:11.060
was obsessed with the brand.

52:11.060 --> 52:14.620
That does explain his hit song, I Love Tiny Donuts.

52:15.540 --> 52:17.340
His commitment to working with us

52:17.340 --> 52:19.460
to develop a natural and authentic twist

52:19.460 --> 52:22.940
on the Tim's experience is what made Tim Bieb's a hit.

52:22.940 --> 52:25.140
And we know guests are gonna love Bieb's Brew

52:25.140 --> 52:26.580
and his take on Tim's cold brew.

52:26.580 --> 52:28.900
Now, Travis, you're about to be even more embarrassed.

52:28.900 --> 52:30.860
That's not possible, Justin.

52:30.860 --> 52:33.220
Because I'm gonna play for you the commercial

52:33.220 --> 52:37.180
for Bieb's Brew, where Bieb's is the last one in the office

52:37.180 --> 52:39.860
just staring at a tank of cold brew.

52:39.860 --> 52:41.540
Hello, Pam?

52:41.540 --> 52:43.980
Justin, what are you still doing here?

52:43.980 --> 52:46.020
Job's not done yet.

52:46.020 --> 52:47.460
What do you mean your job's not done yet?

52:47.460 --> 52:49.060
I haven't tried the final product.

52:49.060 --> 52:52.060
Oh, no, that takes 16 hours for it to steep

52:52.060 --> 52:53.180
before it's ready, so we can just, you know,

52:53.180 --> 52:54.860
call you back in 15 hours.

52:54.860 --> 52:57.060
Yeah, not a chance I let someone put their lips

52:57.060 --> 52:59.260
on the Bieb's Brew before this guy.

52:59.260 --> 53:00.940
I'm a stay-in.

53:00.940 --> 53:01.780
Okay.

53:03.180 --> 53:04.220
Let's put your neck pillow on.

53:04.220 --> 53:05.820
Good night, Justin.

53:05.820 --> 53:06.980
Don't forget to lock up.

53:08.140 --> 53:09.460
Okay.

53:09.460 --> 53:11.020
Dream about Timmy's.

53:11.020 --> 53:12.500
I will.

53:12.500 --> 53:13.340
Love you.

53:14.420 --> 53:15.780
I love you, too.

53:15.780 --> 53:17.140
Okay.

53:17.140 --> 53:18.540
I'm glad you said it first.

53:20.340 --> 53:21.180
Night.

53:24.540 --> 53:26.100
Manny really loves his Tim's.

53:29.940 --> 53:33.260
Try my French Vanilla Bieb's Brew for a limited time.

53:33.260 --> 53:35.100
Only at Tim's.

53:35.100 --> 53:36.660
It's worth the wait.

53:36.660 --> 53:37.620
The fact that they added-

53:37.620 --> 53:38.460
What the fuck?

53:38.460 --> 53:39.500
The last good thing is-

53:39.500 --> 53:41.220
The fact they added that postscript

53:41.220 --> 53:42.740
is an act of cowardice.

53:42.740 --> 53:44.780
Yeah, shouldn't have just left it there.

53:44.780 --> 53:46.940
A truly brave marketing campaign

53:46.940 --> 53:48.900
would have ended it with him

53:48.900 --> 53:50.460
saying I love you to this woman

53:50.460 --> 53:51.540
and then just cut to black,

53:51.540 --> 53:53.980
and it's up to you to figure out what's going on.

53:53.980 --> 53:54.820
What do you think happened here?

53:54.820 --> 53:56.340
Can I also just say, bold,

53:56.340 --> 53:58.500
to be like, oh, we're in an office.

53:58.500 --> 54:01.380
What's like a name of a woman who would be in an office?

54:01.380 --> 54:02.220
Pam.

54:02.220 --> 54:03.060
Great.

54:03.060 --> 54:03.900
Nailed it.

54:03.900 --> 54:05.820
Pam was the one from the last commercial, Travis.

54:05.820 --> 54:07.460
It's a recurring character.

54:07.460 --> 54:09.020
We're invested in their relationship.

54:09.020 --> 54:10.500
I ship these two.

54:10.500 --> 54:11.340
Pam Biebs.

54:11.340 --> 54:13.300
Okay, small rewrite though.

54:13.300 --> 54:14.380
How great would the commercial have been

54:14.380 --> 54:15.940
if he had been like, I love you,

54:15.940 --> 54:18.300
and she'd be like, what the fuck?

54:18.300 --> 54:19.140
The fuck is wrong with you?

54:19.140 --> 54:20.260
What are you talking about?

54:20.260 --> 54:21.540
Are you okay?

54:21.540 --> 54:23.300
How's your power imbalance doing, Justin?

54:23.300 --> 54:24.620
I don't know what's happening anymore.

54:24.620 --> 54:27.540
Shouldn't you be in a studio or going on tour?

54:27.540 --> 54:29.220
What are you doing here?

54:29.220 --> 54:30.380
I can't go home.

54:30.380 --> 54:31.220
I can't go home, Pam.

54:31.220 --> 54:33.740
This does seem like how these things begin

54:33.740 --> 54:35.740
where it's like, yeah, we did a couple of collaborations

54:35.740 --> 54:37.980
and then all I cared about was doing good at donuts

54:37.980 --> 54:39.980
and now I don't do music anymore.

54:39.980 --> 54:42.860
So that's what happened to Kenny Rogers with Roasters.

54:42.860 --> 54:44.140
That's what's happened to me.

54:44.140 --> 54:45.180
And here we are.

54:46.380 --> 54:47.980
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

54:47.980 --> 54:49.100
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

54:49.100 --> 54:51.940
I sure had fun with y'all.

54:51.940 --> 54:53.540
We're in the month of Man Vs. B,

54:53.540 --> 54:54.900
so we're closer than ever.

54:54.900 --> 54:56.100
Hang in there.

54:56.100 --> 54:56.940
Hang in there.

54:58.140 --> 55:01.820
We got so much stuff in our fucking merch store.

55:01.820 --> 55:04.140
You're gonna puke when you see all that.

55:04.140 --> 55:05.420
Count Donut Pen.

55:05.420 --> 55:08.220
Got a Count Donut Pen that was designed by Kevin Budnick.

55:08.220 --> 55:10.020
That is so choice.

55:10.020 --> 55:12.380
We got a Taz sticker sheet that's in the same style

55:12.380 --> 55:14.900
as the temporary tattoo sheet already in the shop.

55:14.900 --> 55:17.900
You can't tattoo your laptop,

55:17.900 --> 55:19.180
but you can put a sticker on it.

55:19.180 --> 55:20.780
Those are made by Lynn Doyle.

55:20.780 --> 55:21.620
Thanks, Lynn.

55:21.620 --> 55:23.620
And 10% of all the merch proceeds this month

55:23.620 --> 55:25.220
goes to Fairness WV.

55:25.220 --> 55:26.940
That stands for West Virginia.

55:26.940 --> 55:29.540
It's the statewide civil rights advocacy organization

55:29.540 --> 55:31.360
dedicated to fair treatment and civil rights

55:31.360 --> 55:34.580
for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender West Virginians.

55:34.580 --> 55:36.500
It's a legitimately good group

55:36.500 --> 55:39.220
that has done legitimately a lot of really good stuff.

55:39.220 --> 55:40.060
Well, I'd like to assume

55:40.060 --> 55:42.180
that of all the people we've supported, Justin.

55:42.180 --> 55:43.700
No, no, no, no, no.

55:43.700 --> 55:44.660
But this one's really good.

55:44.660 --> 55:45.500
Oh, okay.

55:45.500 --> 55:47.180

We're also going to be doing a My Brother, My Brother and Me

56:23.980 --> 56:26.140

56:32.860 --> 56:36.580
I mean, we're also going to be in Salt Lake City,

56:36.580 --> 56:40.420

56:40.420 --> 56:41.540
So get all those tickets,

56:41.540 --> 56:44.780
mask and proof of full vaccination or negative COVID test

56:44.780 --> 56:47.700
within 72 hours of event start is required.

56:47.700 --> 56:51.780
I also just wanted to say I went and did a Phoenix Fan Fusion,

56:51.780 --> 56:54.140
what, when this comes out, what, like a week ago.

56:54.140 --> 56:56.100
And I just wanna say thank you to everybody who stopped by.

56:56.100 --> 56:57.700
It was great seeing you.

56:57.700 --> 57:01.100
All right, Phoenix, I did not care for like the 104 degree

57:01.100 --> 57:03.460
temperatures, that's obscene,

57:03.460 --> 57:05.460
but I was glad to see everybody there.

57:05.460 --> 57:07.340
I'm sure they've never gotten that before.

57:07.340 --> 57:09.060
It was so hot, guys.

57:09.060 --> 57:11.700
And would somebody have the audacity to say to me,

57:11.700 --> 57:14.560
well, be glad you're here before it gets hot?

57:14.560 --> 57:16.300
Well, they're- How dare you?

57:16.300 --> 57:17.220
They're different.

57:17.220 --> 57:19.020
They have- They're built different.

57:19.020 --> 57:21.540
They're built different. They're built different.

57:21.540 --> 57:23.620
Thanks to Montaigne for the use of a theme song,

57:23.620 --> 57:25.500
My Life Is Better With You.

57:25.500 --> 57:27.080
Check that totally out.

57:27.080 --> 57:28.980
And have a good time with your friends too.

57:28.980 --> 57:30.420
Just like roll down the windows of the car

57:30.420 --> 57:32.860
and like put your arms and legs out the windows

57:32.860 --> 57:34.980
and drive super fast while you listen to it.

57:34.980 --> 57:36.780
Griff, I'm gonna need you to take me out

57:36.780 --> 57:39.580
with a celebrity impression of Justin Bieber.

57:39.580 --> 57:40.940
Trying, no, no, listen.

57:40.940 --> 57:42.940
Justin Bieber trying a cold brew

57:42.940 --> 57:44.860
that he does not approve of,

57:44.860 --> 57:46.300
and they have to start over. Oh, yes, too sweet.

57:46.300 --> 57:50.220
Okay, let me, I'll use my coffee here to.

57:50.220 --> 57:55.220
Pfft. Sacre bleu.

57:58.500 --> 58:05.500
My name is Justin-

58:05.500 --> 58:06.740
I'm Travis. That's how he really does.

58:06.740 --> 58:07.580
That's how he really does.

58:07.580 --> 58:08.900
Watch the documentary.

58:08.900 --> 58:11.940
Yeah. It's been my brother, my brother,

58:11.940 --> 58:13.940
me kissing dad's grown lips.

58:13.940 --> 58:21.200
My life is better with you

58:21.200 --> 58:25.740
My life It's better,

58:25.740 --> 58:27.700
it's better with you

58:27.700 --> 58:31.820
My life It's better,

58:31.820 --> 58:33.820
it's better with you

58:33.840 --> 58:36.940
Is it true?

58:36.940 --> 58:39.940
It's better, it's better with two

58:39.940 --> 58:51.300
It's better with you.
