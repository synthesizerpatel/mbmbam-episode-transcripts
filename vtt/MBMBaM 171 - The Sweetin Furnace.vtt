00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.680
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm

00:47.680 --> 00:50.880
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.720
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Guys, the government is shut down.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.760
Scrapping it together. Against all odds.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.880
Gum and twine over here. Sticking it together with gum and twine.

01:01.600 --> 01:05.200
This is the worst conditions under which we have ever recorded

01:05.200 --> 01:06.880
My Brother, My Brother. Let's break it down.

01:06.880 --> 01:10.240
This is the daddy I made you an ashtray episode.

01:12.080 --> 01:15.680
You thought that we weren't going to have an episode. Maybe it would have been better if we

01:15.680 --> 01:19.920
didn't, but we got hungry mouths to feed. All right. So condition one.

01:19.920 --> 01:26.160
Condition one. My Macintosh computer made by Apple Corporation is dead. I am recording on a

01:26.160 --> 01:32.560
personal computer made by Bill Gates himself. I'm assuming it is college days because it doesn't

01:32.560 --> 01:36.800
have anything. Bill Gates sent Justin an email said, listen, Justin, I understand you need to

01:36.800 --> 01:42.160
scrap together a butt quality episode. I understand that this is something you need to do. So have

01:42.160 --> 01:48.960
this Tandy 12 for free. This is the 12th Tandy to roll off the line. I tried to install Java and

01:48.960 --> 01:54.320
a guy came by and poured coffee into my lap. It is the worst computer anyone's ever used.

01:54.320 --> 01:59.280
I am recording at work at the Cincinnati Shakespeare Company in the ladies dressing room.

01:59.840 --> 02:03.600
I am Skyping through my phone, according onto my computer,

02:03.600 --> 02:08.800
and you may from time to time hear them recorded rehearsing of mice and men in the background.

02:10.320 --> 02:14.880
I am technically at work right now. So that's my that's my cross to bear.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.800
Oh, also, I just got married. So that's really slowing me down.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.680
We should back up and explain that Travis just got married.

02:21.680 --> 02:28.400
And let's just say we were a little presumptive in the amount of free time we thought we'd have

02:28.400 --> 02:32.640
during Travis's wedding, I guess. Yeah, I guess we had made plans to like

02:34.160 --> 02:39.840
ditch all our family and friends and then just like mid ceremony. Like there's there's the

02:39.840 --> 02:46.880
homily. There's the charge, a couple of songs, the wine ceremony, duck out for a quick record sesh

02:46.880 --> 02:53.360
and then the vows. Yeah, fully, fully like graduate style, fending the family off as we

02:53.360 --> 02:58.480
as we run away down the aisles and we did. But the episode wasn't that funny. So we scrapped it.

02:58.480 --> 03:04.400
Yeah, it was mostly Travis crying like a little bitch. Travis, do you want to? Sorry, should we?

03:04.400 --> 03:08.160
Let's keep painting a picture of this wedding. Travis, do you want to talk about how many like

03:08.160 --> 03:13.280
little bitch tears you cried out? I cried three. No, it was more than three.

03:13.280 --> 03:18.800
It was just three. I was I was the best man standing standing at riding shotgun in the cockpit.

03:18.800 --> 03:24.880
I only recall three. He had me carry special tissues for him. And during several times during

03:24.880 --> 03:30.880
the wedding, he turned to me like, I'm sorry, I'm such a pussy. No, I had a really bad nosebleed.

03:31.520 --> 03:36.320
Yeah. And I needed the tissues. So I didn't get a beautiful dress with water. My eyes were bleeding

03:36.320 --> 03:40.960
because I was crying so hard like a pussy. Oh, oh, oh, I forgot to mention one of the things.

03:40.960 --> 03:46.560
I'm using a Battlefield 3 keyboard on my personal computer. And this is literally what it sounds

03:46.560 --> 03:54.080
like. Are you ready for this? Jesus, you sound like a hacker on CSI. That is literally enhance,

03:54.080 --> 03:59.600
enhance. This is literally what it sounds like. So taking them back to the good old days,

03:59.600 --> 04:06.640
the rock band microphone days. I used to like those days because I could hold the microphone

04:06.640 --> 04:12.160
like sim bad. And you know, if I had a good line, I could literally drop it here. If I drop it,

04:12.160 --> 04:16.880
you know, I got to go back to Amazon and buy a new one these days. So this is an advice show for

04:16.880 --> 04:24.320
the modern era where we help young people and old people, I assume, from time to time, navigate the

04:24.320 --> 04:31.120
rocky waters of life. And let's let's get into that right now. When my husband and I watch our

04:31.120 --> 04:34.800
favorite serial dramas, I prefer to let things unfold without trying too hard to guess what's

04:34.800 --> 04:39.840
going to happen next. My husband is the type who likes to guess what's going to happen out loud.

04:39.840 --> 04:45.200
And he's often right. His correct guesses include some key points in the season two finale Boardwalk

04:45.200 --> 04:49.600
Empire and the series finale of Breaking Bad moments that would have been pretty jaw dropping

04:49.600 --> 04:54.160
to a passive viewer like myself. Had he not already predicted what was going to happen.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.440
I asked him to quit sharing his spoilers with me and keep quiet till the show's over. He said

04:57.440 --> 05:02.000
they're not technically spoilers since he doesn't know what's going to happen. He's just guessing.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.280
Um, there's more to this question, but I think we get the gist. That's from passive

05:07.280 --> 05:12.240
versus predictive in Portland. The thing is, there's two different ways he could be doing

05:12.240 --> 05:17.120
that. Like Teresa does this, but it's usually just out of fear and tension where she says,

05:17.120 --> 05:20.480
like, oh, he's not going to die. You see, he's not, they're not going to kill him. Are they

05:21.040 --> 05:26.480
versus they're going to kill him? It's these are still spoilers. I think if you guess something

05:26.480 --> 05:30.000
correctly in the past and it turns out to be true, you spoiled it. You did spoil it.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.840
Oh, I mean, I agree either way because it's usually like I, I always hate it when you're

05:35.840 --> 05:40.000
watching something you've already seen with someone who hasn't. And you can remember it

05:40.000 --> 05:43.920
being this huge reveal moment. And then that person being like, ah, he's going to fall down

05:43.920 --> 05:49.840
the stairs and you're like, what? Um, just watch it. I have a, I have an alternative to suggest,

05:49.840 --> 05:55.040
uh, for you to suggest to your husband. It was a cool move that I pulled once when, uh,

05:55.040 --> 06:01.040
some friends and I were watching the, uh, one of the mini season premieres of 24. Uh, I didn't

06:01.040 --> 06:06.240
watch that program. This is a baller move on your part. This is a baller move. I, I, uh, I

06:06.800 --> 06:13.920
had a feeling and I got a little scrap of paper and I folded it. I wrote a note on it and I folded

06:13.920 --> 06:19.920
it and I, uh, just showed everybody the note and I put it down on the table. And then, uh, again,

06:19.920 --> 06:26.160
here comes the spoilers if you haven't watched. And then, uh, when this incredible moment happened,

06:26.160 --> 06:30.800
I took out my scrap of paper that said, president Palmer will be assassinated before the first

06:30.800 --> 06:35.200
commercial break. And then he was, and then you dropped it on the table, like the fucking finale

06:35.200 --> 06:40.160
of rounders. I checked my style out. I think you actually said, check my style out. Check this

06:40.160 --> 06:46.400
style. Check this dope style I have. I mean, but the other end to that choose your own adventure

06:46.400 --> 06:50.800
is that you lay down and then you just slowly reach out and pick it back up and eat it.

06:51.760 --> 06:56.800
Or you just slowly slip it into my mouth. You just fucking like take it home and it like sits

06:56.800 --> 06:59.920
on your dresser for a while. And every once in a while you look at it and just think about what a

06:59.920 --> 07:04.160
stupid idiot you are. Like what I went through all that fucking trouble. That is a, that's a

07:04.160 --> 07:08.880
baller play, Justin. I'm not going to lie, but if it doesn't pan out, that's a, that's a cross you

07:08.880 --> 07:13.280
have to bear for the rest of your life. Like knowing that you spent the time to you, you put

07:13.280 --> 07:18.960
in even like a little stamp on the envelope, which seems excessive to me. That'll make him count it

07:18.960 --> 07:24.560
though. Like he has to be really sure before he opens his pen. Oh, that's true. Right. Yeah. His

07:24.560 --> 07:29.440
pen's gotta be his pen mouth to be absolutely concretely sure that this is what is going to

07:29.440 --> 07:36.000
happen in the series. Uh, which, which might help to stave off his, uh, his spoiling. Our dad used

07:36.000 --> 07:41.520
to be the worst, the worst or the best. Well, dad would like subconsciously spoil something where

07:41.520 --> 07:48.480
he wouldn't say anything. He would just go, ah, okay. Wait, hold on. What, what is it? He was

07:48.480 --> 07:54.080
like, no, just watch. I think I know. I think I just watch. And, and, and that was another level

07:54.080 --> 07:58.160
because we could never prove or disprove the correctness of his theory. He might have just

07:58.160 --> 08:05.200
been doing that. Yeah. That might just be a dad move that dads can pull. I see what's happening.

08:05.200 --> 08:09.920
Okay. I think you should just keep your mouth shut. Just enjoy it together. Just enjoy the

08:09.920 --> 08:15.280
moments together. And then afterwards he can say, that's what I thought was going to happen in my

08:15.280 --> 08:22.480
brain, but I didn't say anything about it out of courtesy. My dad will still text me like during

08:22.480 --> 08:28.000
Doctor Who. He's like, I know it's, I know what's happening. Like, okay. All right. You live in

08:28.000 --> 08:32.960
another state now. You can't keep doing this to me. I'm my own man. I have a wife and a home. I'm

08:32.960 --> 08:43.360
a grown adult. Stop terrorizing me. Y'all want a yahoo? Yeah. It sounds like to us, just see,

08:43.360 --> 08:46.720
it probably sounds fine when you're listening this at home. It sounds to us like Travis is

08:46.720 --> 08:52.720
being held in a Russian prison. It sounds like they gave him a payphone to call his brothers.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.680
That is actually what we're doing for our honeymoon. It's a whole experience that you

08:55.680 --> 09:01.600
can sign up for and you spend a week in a gulag. Travis actually was a founding member of Pussy

09:01.600 --> 09:11.120
Riot. He thought that he was signing up for some sort of rad party. But no, he was actually in a

09:11.120 --> 09:15.520
feminist punk band. Do you guys want a yahoo? I asked you this and you said yes. This yahoo was

09:15.520 --> 09:22.800
sent in by Drew Davenport. Thanks Drew. It's by yahoo answers user Miana who asks, what can you

09:22.800 --> 09:30.240
do while you're pregnant to make baby be born with a head full of hair? That's it. Eat a lot of hair.

09:30.240 --> 09:34.720
Next question. I think that's pretty good. I think if you can eat a lot of hair and some sort of

09:34.720 --> 09:39.840
bonding agent, that is a tricky needle to thread because you're going to need something that's

09:39.840 --> 09:45.360
going to make it through your gully works without stopping the shit up, but it still has to be

09:45.360 --> 09:52.800
cohesive enough to bond the hair together into some sort of fetus wig. The terrible risk that

09:52.800 --> 09:57.600
you're running there is that your baby will see it and it comes in with all the other food you're

09:57.600 --> 10:03.280
eating. And this is a stupid baby things like, oh, this is food. Oh, I was going the other way

10:04.160 --> 10:09.200
where you end up with some, some food on their head or he has a taste for hair. He just loves

10:09.200 --> 10:14.800
to eat hair. It's all osmosis down there in the, in the early months of the formation of the feti,

10:14.800 --> 10:22.560
right? It's all osmo osmotic, right? All osmosis Jones, all of these, if this fucking osmosis Jones

10:22.560 --> 10:30.400
that's growing inside of you, it's just a big bag of translucent cells and shit. Anything can pass

10:30.400 --> 10:34.480
through there. You gotta be careful. If you eat a Frito and it goes down the wrong pipe, that baby

10:34.480 --> 10:41.040
is going to come out with Frito hands. Cause it's just, your tummy doesn't know what's up. It doesn't

10:41.040 --> 10:46.080
know where to put things. By the way, Tim Burton, I don't know why you thought that Edwards is

10:46.080 --> 10:52.720
their hands needed a follow-up, but Ricky Frito hands is not, is not in keeping with you. I'll

10:52.720 --> 10:57.920
always remember he was totally crunchtastic. It's the best, it's the best Christmas ever.

10:59.280 --> 11:05.360
Um, you can probably just eat a bunch of hair and then nature finds a way, you know,

11:05.360 --> 11:11.440
he'll figure things out in there. What about this? Ch-ch-ch-chia. What is,

11:11.440 --> 11:17.840
you just said a slogan of a thing. Ch-ch-ch-chia. It's the pottery that grows.

11:17.840 --> 11:21.200
Yeah. We know what it is clearly, but how does this, how is it?

11:21.200 --> 11:24.960
You're going to need to swallow. I think it was like mud with some seeds in it.

11:26.480 --> 11:31.840
And then with your like belly hands, smooth it onto the baby's head with your, so you're a

11:31.840 --> 11:35.920
little bit unclear just about the basic mechanics. You got the belly hands in there and that's what

11:35.920 --> 11:43.520
puts the baby together. Travis has a fundamental misunderstanding of gully works.

11:45.520 --> 11:48.560
They put it together like in a factory and that's what, that's what daddy told me.

11:49.280 --> 11:55.120
You're saying that every woman's uterus contains a set of hands, like the tunnel in the labyrinth

11:55.680 --> 12:01.680
that Jennifer Connelly falls down through and then the hands push the baby down,

12:01.680 --> 12:06.000
but while the baby is in there, they put the parts together. That's why, that's why the

12:06.000 --> 12:14.240
dude says push and then the hands all push it. This is a horrifying, I, I never. Happy Halloween.

12:17.200 --> 12:23.360
That's the spooky twist of pregnancy. I never want anybody to be pregnant again now. No. Yeah.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.440
That's that. That's the plot line to story, uh, children of men.

12:27.440 --> 12:33.040
And all the hands like, fuck it. Yeah. Fuck it. We're done. We're on strike.

12:33.760 --> 12:38.320
They all got game boy body case and they did stop working. Is there a way that you can copulate?

12:38.320 --> 12:43.120
Cause from what I understand, life's life obviously starts at inception. I mean conception

12:43.120 --> 12:47.520
life started with when the movie inception was made. Life starts with conception.

12:48.080 --> 12:52.160
Or that was all amoebas and sun. More like life starts at deception.

12:52.160 --> 12:59.760
And yeah, not trying to, trying to get my money or something. I don't know. Uh, there's, there's,

12:59.760 --> 13:04.560
I think that there's a way to like chop and screw and get the kind of baby that you want to get

13:05.360 --> 13:10.400
while you are, um, chopping and screwing. If you know what I mean, I think that it's like,

13:10.400 --> 13:13.360
you know how they say like, wait till there's a full moon and then have sex

13:13.360 --> 13:19.360
upside down on a couch while saying ABCs with the Wolfman with a Wolfman. And then that's how you,

13:19.360 --> 13:25.760
um, you know, that's how you have a strong baby. I think there's probably a method of copulation

13:25.760 --> 13:31.040
that you can exercise, uh, to make sure that you got a her suit child. You gotta have,

13:31.040 --> 13:36.400
you gotta do it, uh, whilst on a treadmill and eating a plate full of angel hair pasta, no sauce.

13:36.960 --> 13:41.920
That's quite the balancing act. Does it, can it be on like, do you want a hairy baby or not?

13:42.800 --> 13:45.840
That's how I prep for marathons. It can't be the same procedure.

13:45.840 --> 13:49.840
Mm-hmm. Oh, be careful. Be careful. You might get pregnant with a hairy baby.

13:51.680 --> 13:58.320
Man. Pregnancy is the weirdest. Once you're pregnant, it's probably too late to be Italian,

13:58.320 --> 14:02.400
isn't it? Because I think that that seems to be a pretty good method.

14:02.400 --> 14:11.360
I think, uh, by the point that you are conceived not by Italian people that shipped unsailed.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.080
This was my fear. I was afraid you were going to say that.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.000
I don't think- But I had to take a shot.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.640
I don't think there's a way to remix it in the post.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.920
We'll fix it. It's white? Eh.

14:21.920 --> 14:22.960
Don't worry about it. Fix it in post.

14:22.960 --> 14:23.680
Don't worry about it.

14:23.680 --> 14:27.600
Guys, I've been dating my boyfriend for about six months now. He came to me with a predicament.

14:28.160 --> 14:33.440
He wants to recreate his image, mainly his wardrobe, to look more adult as he prepares

14:33.440 --> 14:37.840
to graduate college in May. He is a relatively skinny guy, and the clothes he wears right now

14:37.840 --> 14:41.680
are too big on him and make him look a lot younger. He asked for my help, but here's my

14:41.680 --> 14:46.160
worry. I know exactly the look I want him to have. Kind of a Joseph Gordon-Levitt vibe,

14:46.720 --> 14:49.920
but don't- Yeah, yeah, you and me both, sister. Come on.

14:49.920 --> 14:54.160
Yeah, yeah. If you figure that one out, let me know. Uh, how do I help with this new wardrobe

14:54.160 --> 14:58.480
without seeming pushy and aggressive, and, like, I really hate what he wears now. How

14:58.480 --> 15:02.480
could I get on that JGL grind? That's from Baggy in Boston.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.560
I mean, I have a- I have a real answer.

15:04.560 --> 15:05.600
Go ahead, Travis.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.400
Oh, great.

15:06.400 --> 15:12.640
Here's my real answer. So what you need to do is, uh, to plug a video clip. He was just

15:12.640 --> 15:16.720
on, uh, Jimmy Kimmel. No, he was on Jimmy Fallon.

15:16.720 --> 15:19.280
No, he was on Jimmy Johns.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.520
He was on- He was at a Jimmy Johns, and Travis saw him.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.000
He was on Jimmy Neutron. Boy, genius.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.080
He was on Jimmy Durante's Show from Heaven.

15:26.080 --> 15:26.720
Oh, this is fun.

15:26.720 --> 15:27.760
The talk show from heaven.

15:27.760 --> 15:32.160
But he- So he was on, uh, Jimmy Fallon, and they did, like, a, uh, lip sync off. Show

15:32.160 --> 15:35.360
him that clip, and while you're watching that clip, say, like, God, that's a bea- That's

15:35.360 --> 15:36.640
an awesome jacket.

15:36.640 --> 15:37.040
Yeah.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.680
And just, like, start- And just do that every time you see things like that.

15:39.680 --> 15:43.920
Man, look at those jean- Look at those jean shorts, because he's wearing jean shorts.

15:43.920 --> 15:49.520
He was wearing jorts. And just, like, subtly plant things like that, you know, and any

15:49.520 --> 15:53.360
time you see something- Rather than go, you should buy that jacket, say, like, oh, that's

15:53.360 --> 15:54.640
a- that's a rockin' jacket.

15:54.640 --> 15:55.120
Oh, what a great guy.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.560
I think that would look really good on you.

15:56.560 --> 15:57.920
Don't you want to be him?

15:57.920 --> 15:59.200
Well, maybe don't take it that far.

16:00.080 --> 16:05.200
Travis has brought us a response to this question from an alternate dimension where any man

16:05.200 --> 16:08.560
ever has picked up on subtext or contextual clues.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.160
No, no, no, because what I- That's never occurred.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.680
Because what I'm saying is you're planting it in his subconscious so that when he goes

16:13.680 --> 16:18.240
shopping and he sees a jacket like that, he's gonna go, ah, I like that jacket.

16:18.240 --> 16:21.360
He is not going to go out looking for that jacket.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.560
I- No, absolutely not, Travis.

16:24.560 --> 16:25.040
I'm sorry.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.040
Maybe we have different methods of shopping.

16:27.040 --> 16:32.480
When I go into a men's clothing store, I'm running around like Dorothy when those trees

16:32.480 --> 16:34.000
are throwing apples at her, okay?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.280
I'm just- My-

16:35.280 --> 16:39.840
Any- anything I can get a grip on, I'm reaching through the darkness, screaming at the top

16:39.840 --> 16:44.640
of my lungs, hoping against hope that I can find solid ground where I'm not gonna get

16:44.640 --> 16:48.880
any more- My entire emo is not, um,

16:50.480 --> 16:52.960
WWJGLD.

16:52.960 --> 16:56.320
It is, god damn, I hope I don't embarrass myself in here.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.720
Let's just find- let's just find the things.

16:58.720 --> 17:03.920
I'll go to Old Navy, I'll take in ten shirts, because one of them will fit, and then

17:03.920 --> 17:10.320
I'll very hurriedly and embarrassedly just toss the other nine on the put away table,

17:10.320 --> 17:14.160
the this is your problem now table, and then- and then skirt my way on out of there.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.320
And even that one- even that one's not gonna fit.

17:16.320 --> 17:19.520
It'll work on the sleeves, definitely not in the neck and chest area.

17:20.080 --> 17:24.160
And that is why, with that lack of self-confidence, you guys will never be married.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.560
Well, that's not true for Justin and almost certainly not true for me.

17:29.760 --> 17:30.560
Alright.

17:30.560 --> 17:36.560
I'm just saying, some of us- some of us are a bit too chesty and necky to be a JGL.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.360
Well, that- I mean, that's the thing.

17:39.360 --> 17:43.760
I would love to dress like JGL, but, like, frankly, I got this, like, barrel chest and

17:43.760 --> 17:45.120
a start of a beer gut.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.080
Like, I can't pull that off.

17:46.080 --> 17:49.680
I'm gonna look like a fucking sausage that's broken through its casing.

17:49.680 --> 17:49.920
Yeah.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.560
Trouser look like a carnival barker.

17:52.560 --> 17:53.760
He can't- he can't do it.

17:53.760 --> 17:54.720
Not again.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.920
It'll look like a Joseph Gordon Levitt that is busted through its casing.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.640
It's- it's horrible.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.480
We have another failed clone, sir.

18:02.480 --> 18:03.200
Oh, God.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.640
We left him in the pan too long.

18:05.360 --> 18:05.920
God.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.880
That's the problem with artisanal Joseph Gordon Levitt, you know?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.320
It sure- it looks great.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.360
It looks rusting, but it's always bursting through its casing as soon as it hits the front.

18:13.360 --> 18:18.560
The sage-crusted potatoes come out really, really well, but the- the JGL, I don't know.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.680
Unless you're using a thick casing, uh, some-

18:21.680 --> 18:24.800
It all depends on how- how thick was your JGL grind.

18:24.800 --> 18:25.600
Yeah, yeah.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.520
If it's- if it's too fine, then it's like you're eating JGL putty.

18:29.520 --> 18:33.600
Too coarse, and it's like a crunchy JGL putty.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.200
You gotta split the uprights.

18:35.200 --> 18:40.480
This is why JGL success late in life is- is a great indicator that nobody knows anything.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.200
Nobody knows a goddamn thing.

18:41.200 --> 18:45.120
If you've been watching Third Rock from the Sun and looked at that little bastard and thought,

18:45.760 --> 18:46.720
he is gifted.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.480
He is going places.

18:48.480 --> 18:52.800
He's not gonna fall into the chasm where we keep all the other Jody Sweetens and the like.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.600
Like, he's gonna bust right out and be his own man.

18:55.600 --> 18:56.400
I wouldn't know.

18:56.400 --> 18:56.800
I wouldn't-

18:56.800 --> 18:58.160
Chuck him in the Sweeten furnace.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.480
Just throw him in there.

19:00.480 --> 19:01.360
Make sure his casing doesn't pop.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.000
But wait a second.

19:02.000 --> 19:02.800
Look through the window.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.320
He's untouched.

19:04.320 --> 19:08.320
It is Shadrach, Meshach, Avednego, and JGL.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.520
I saw a fourth figure in the flames.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.560
Was it an angel?

19:12.560 --> 19:13.120
Kind of.

19:14.080 --> 19:14.960
Kind of.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.480
Did you see 500 Days of Summer?

19:17.040 --> 19:17.840
He dances like one.

19:17.840 --> 19:18.880
Dances like a fucking angel.

19:18.880 --> 19:19.760
Dresses like one.

19:19.760 --> 19:20.720
Sings like one.

19:20.720 --> 19:23.280
My wife loves Josie- Who doesn't?

19:23.280 --> 19:24.080
Everyone loves him.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.760
He's my perfect little sausage boy.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.200
So good.

19:27.200 --> 19:31.760
I wish they hadn't janked up his face in the looper.

19:31.760 --> 19:32.960
In a looper, yeah.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.080
That should be a war crime.

19:34.080 --> 19:34.480
Yeah.

19:34.480 --> 19:38.400
Those people should- You wanted to talk about somebody who should be thrown in a gulag.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.000
It's the people who messed up- Here's the thing.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.800
If I might bitch about looper for one moment, I've never seen a movie in which an actor

19:44.800 --> 19:49.760
played a younger version of an older actor that's also in the film and been bothered

19:49.760 --> 19:51.280
by the fact that they didn't look alike.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.160
Not how it worked.

19:52.160 --> 19:57.200
It looked more like they had put him and Bruce Willis into what will our baby look like generator

19:57.200 --> 19:58.640
and then aged him 25 years.

20:01.440 --> 20:08.960
I think that JGL's look is so on point that Bruce Willis should have had to got reconstructive

20:08.960 --> 20:10.800
surgery to look more like JGL.

20:10.800 --> 20:14.320
Permanent JGL overhaul.

20:14.320 --> 20:22.400
I would have preferred that instead of making JGL look like a JGL BW hybrid in looper, if

20:22.400 --> 20:28.240
they had just made him look completely like old school Bruno, like when he was recording

20:28.240 --> 20:30.160
music, you know what I mean?

20:30.160 --> 20:31.680
Back in the Hudson Hawk era.

20:31.680 --> 20:36.480
Hudson Hawk era fucking pot jazz BW when it was-

20:36.480 --> 20:45.120
Can we just like Photoshop in just like CGI in Hudson Hawk into looper in place of JGL

20:45.120 --> 20:52.320
and then maybe just also like CGI in like JGL just over in the corner crossing his arms

20:52.320 --> 20:53.120
and shaking his head.

20:53.840 --> 21:01.920
Yeah, I bet originally they made JGL look like music slash Hudson Hawk era Bruce Willi,

21:01.920 --> 21:05.280
but he just couldn't help but jam with himself.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.840
Like every time he saw me, he's like, we gotta jam.

21:07.840 --> 21:08.240
Come on.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.680
Gotta kill you, but that'll kill me.

21:09.680 --> 21:10.400
You're right.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.840
Hold this saxophone.

21:11.840 --> 21:12.400
Let's jam.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.440
Let's just jam.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.920
My yearly get together with some of my old friends is coming up.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.640
I'm excited to see them again, but one thing is different.

21:19.280 --> 21:22.000
One of them has a kid since the last time we saw them.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.680
I absolutely detest holding babies, but I'm sure the child will be passed around at some

21:27.680 --> 21:28.320
point.

21:28.320 --> 21:32.880
Is there any way to decline without making the moment awkward or should I just suck it

21:32.880 --> 21:36.240
up and play along pretending I'm not screaming on the inside?

21:36.240 --> 21:38.720
That's from Indisposed in Indiana.

21:39.360 --> 21:42.880
Just tell them legally you're not allowed to be within 300 yards of a child.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.240
Yeah, that'll go really, really well.

21:44.240 --> 21:47.440
I think that'll keep her from being awkward.

21:47.440 --> 21:50.560
You want to talk about being afraid of popping something outside of its casing.

21:52.640 --> 21:58.320
Can babies, what can you do during copulation to give your baby thicker, firmer skin?

21:58.320 --> 22:00.720
I feel like I can see through every baby I hold.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.600
I want to really build up my baby's chitin.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.160
Yeah, I don't think that's too much to ask a baby shell.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.760
A strong exoskeleton.

22:08.960 --> 22:09.680
Here's what you do.

22:11.200 --> 22:14.000
In the kitchen, you keep a tray of jelly.

22:15.120 --> 22:19.200
When the baby starts being passed around, you run into the kitchen, dip your hands in

22:19.200 --> 22:23.040
the jelly and say something like, just cooking up some jelly things.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.240
I'm doing something in here.

22:25.200 --> 22:29.120
Doing something in here and then rush out when it's your turn and say, ah.

22:29.120 --> 22:31.040
Would love to.

22:31.040 --> 22:32.560
Love to hold the baby.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.480
Got jelly on my hands though.

22:34.480 --> 22:37.040
Can't at the moment because of the jelly.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.480
Does it have to be jelly?

22:38.480 --> 22:42.080
Because I feel like there's a myriad of things that if you had on your hands, the parents

22:42.080 --> 22:43.200
would not want you to.

22:43.200 --> 22:47.440
If you got jelly in a baby's crevices, do you know how long you'd have to work to get

22:47.440 --> 22:48.160
all that gunk out?

22:48.160 --> 22:49.280
You know how many folds they have?

22:49.280 --> 22:51.920
Justin, you're forgetting something though.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.800
This baby's probably already going to have quite a bit of jelly on it.

22:54.800 --> 23:02.400
This baby's already going to have a preternatural layer of self jelly that the parents are going

23:02.400 --> 23:03.440
to be like, I don't worry about it.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.600
It's just, you know, you're just going to add.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.200
We'll hose them down in the back.

23:07.200 --> 23:10.160
Yeah, we have, we hose them every 10 minutes.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.920
So like, go ahead and get that jelly on there.

23:12.560 --> 23:12.960
Okay.

23:12.960 --> 23:13.280
All right.

23:13.280 --> 23:13.600
All right.

23:13.600 --> 23:17.520
It'll make it easier actually to see the other jelly that's already on this kid.

23:17.520 --> 23:20.000
If you just go ahead and jelly them up.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.440
Like plot candy basically.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.400
What if you bring them like a baby shower kind of present and you're like, hey, I got

23:24.400 --> 23:25.120
this for you.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.480
It's a baby suit of armor.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.920
Are you worried about hurting the baby?

23:29.920 --> 23:30.640
Is that the problem?

23:30.640 --> 23:32.160
Or are you just like, ew.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.280
I think it's, who doesn't love holding beautiful babies?

23:35.280 --> 23:36.320
It's an embarrassment thing.

23:36.320 --> 23:37.440
How are you even supposed to hold?

23:37.440 --> 23:38.640
How do you hold a baby, Justin?

23:38.640 --> 23:39.440
Let me critique it.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.480
How do you hold a baby?

23:42.480 --> 23:43.280
Fireman's carry.

23:44.720 --> 23:49.280
By their heel, I'm going to dip them in a lake and give them a blessing.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.760
See, there's no right way to do it because there's only one right.

23:51.760 --> 23:56.160
There's, there's one right way to hold a baby, but that way over your shoulder, like a

23:56.160 --> 23:57.200
continental soldier.

23:57.200 --> 23:57.680
No, no, no.

23:57.680 --> 24:02.160
You scoop, you scoop them and you, you scoop them right in the, your loving crevice of

24:02.160 --> 24:02.960
your arms.

24:02.960 --> 24:03.360
Right.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.600
And you have to support the head or it falls off.

24:05.600 --> 24:09.760
If you do that to a stranger baby though, it feels like you're trying to steal.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.440
It looks like you're trying to steal it.

24:12.000 --> 24:12.400
Right.

24:12.400 --> 24:17.360
And when you hold it like that, it looks like you're trying to, to, to supersede the parents

24:17.360 --> 24:18.480
and become the new parent.

24:18.480 --> 24:19.920
And that's way too forward.

24:20.480 --> 24:21.040
Oh, okay.

24:21.040 --> 24:25.040
I've got an idea and it'll, it'll force you to hold the baby, but for the shortest amount

24:25.040 --> 24:29.040
of time possible, hold the baby and then go right into the Heisman.

24:29.840 --> 24:32.560
I guarantee those parents will take that baby back from you.

24:32.560 --> 24:35.760
Travis, I feel like you're being a little devil may care with this baby's life.

24:35.760 --> 24:36.640
Heisman.

24:36.640 --> 24:37.040
Yeah.

24:37.040 --> 24:37.840
Little reckless.

24:38.400 --> 24:39.680
I like the jelly idea.

24:39.680 --> 24:43.600
I feel like there's something you could have on your hands at all times that would preclude,

24:43.600 --> 24:46.880
but like, what are babies vulnerabilities?

24:46.880 --> 24:48.560
Like what are babies weak to?

24:48.560 --> 24:50.320
Everything.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.440
Maybe have some like raccoons on your hands.

24:54.560 --> 24:54.960
Okay.

24:54.960 --> 24:58.000
If you could cut your hands in raccoons, I think you'd be out of baby duty.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.200
Oh, bad schools.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.960
Have bad schools on your hands.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.640
Can you cover yourself in bad schools?

25:05.920 --> 25:07.120
Can you get another baby?

25:07.680 --> 25:10.560
Let's say this is my baby and I'm bonding.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.480
So I don't want to mess up the bonding.

25:12.480 --> 25:15.520
Get another baby that has like tattoos and is smoking a cigarette.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.640
And then the parents would be like, well, I don't want my baby around that baby.

25:18.640 --> 25:19.680
A tougher baby.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.760
You should be able to rent a tougher baby for a day.

25:23.760 --> 25:25.680
I'm really nervous to hold babies.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.640
I'm right there with, yeah, I really am.

25:28.640 --> 25:29.760
I super am.

25:29.760 --> 25:30.720
It really is.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.960
I still don't think I've mastered the hold yet.

25:32.960 --> 25:36.320
It's the same way I feel self-conscious when using chopsticks.

25:36.320 --> 25:38.720
It's the same way I feel when using baby.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.400
You just need to hold the baby a couple of times.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.240
You know, you're not going to get better at it if you don't try.

25:42.880 --> 25:43.120
Yeah.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.680
Yeah, no one has babies in Austin though.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.400
Because like I've said before, it's a nation of-

25:48.400 --> 25:49.200
The humidity.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.240
Of 18 year olds.

25:50.240 --> 25:53.840
Also, yeah, nobody wants to get up on all these swamp balls.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.040
They're floating around down here.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.040
Do you want to make love?

25:58.480 --> 25:59.040
I don't know.

25:59.040 --> 26:14.000
Oh, hey guys, I have to get paid.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.640
I want to tell everybody about Warby Parker.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.760
He's a friend of ours that we've talked about a few times.

26:19.760 --> 26:23.440
And I've seen many of you getting into his wares.

26:23.440 --> 26:25.600
So if you haven't gotten on board yet,

26:25.600 --> 26:31.120
these are contemporary eyeglasses that are extremely affordable and fashion forward.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.560
These are not your daddy's glasses.

26:34.560 --> 26:39.040
These are prescription glasses that start at $95 including prescription lenses.

26:39.840 --> 26:42.160
Including prescription lenses.

26:42.160 --> 26:42.960
It's written twice here.

26:42.960 --> 26:44.320
I don't think I'm supposed to say it twice.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.160
But I said it again with emphasis.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.600
Travis probably pasted it bad.

26:48.560 --> 26:52.480
All the glasses have anti-reflective and anti-glare coating at no additional cost.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.120
So here's the best thing.

26:55.120 --> 26:58.000
When you call him and you say, hey, I want five pairs of glasses.

26:58.000 --> 26:58.800
They're going to bring them to you.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.360
Warby's going to get into the Warby mobile.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.280
He's going to drive down to your house with a suitcase.

27:03.280 --> 27:03.760
He'll be like, psst.

27:03.760 --> 27:04.800
The Warby machine.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.280
The Warby machine.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.280
He's going to come to your house.

27:09.280 --> 27:12.160
He's going to let you try on these five pairs of glasses.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.360
Show your family and friends.

27:13.360 --> 27:14.000
Don't worry.

27:14.000 --> 27:14.720
He'll wait.

27:14.720 --> 27:15.600
He'll just sit there.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.040
But he will not eat your food.

27:18.800 --> 27:19.760
He won't hold your baby.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.480
He's not a friend of the family.

27:22.480 --> 27:23.600
He's a glasses salesman.

27:23.600 --> 27:27.120
If Warby's too busy to visit you, he will ship them out.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.120
You get to hang on to him.

27:29.120 --> 27:32.720
Pick the glasses or I guess just the one pair you want.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.000
Then you send the rest back.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.840
Normally they get there within 10 business days.

27:35.840 --> 27:36.960
But we got a promo code.

27:37.440 --> 27:38.480
My brother.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.880
You use it checkout and you're going to get them faster.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.000
So there's that.

27:42.000 --> 27:42.960
So that's fantastic.

27:43.760 --> 27:44.800
And here's the best part.

27:44.800 --> 27:48.960
Well, not the best part, but a good part for every pair of glasses they sell.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.800
They distribute a pair of glasses to someone in need.

27:50.800 --> 27:51.600
Fantastic.

27:51.600 --> 27:55.680
Fantastic you can get non-prescription Polaroid sunglasses from 95 bucks.

27:55.680 --> 27:56.880
Polaroid sunglasses.

27:56.880 --> 27:59.680
Polaroid sunglasses that don't exist.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.480
You can get those for like a million because they're not real.

28:02.480 --> 28:06.800
And then polarized sunglasses from 150 dollars.

28:06.800 --> 28:12.000
Visit warbyparker.com slash my brother to select your five home try on frames.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.120

28:15.440 --> 28:20.000

28:20.000 --> 28:21.920
My you guys know me.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.160
I fucking love my Randy Jacksons.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.520
I fucking love these things.

28:25.520 --> 28:30.560
They have been allowing me to see in crystal clear HD vision for a super long time.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.480
I'm ready to throw these motherfuckers in the street.

28:33.440 --> 28:37.280
Yeah, all thanks to the pressure provided by Warby Parker.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.000
Trav, you've been married now for a few days.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.280
How you been spending your time with your new bride?

28:43.280 --> 28:46.000
We've been watching Hulu Plus like non-stop.

28:46.000 --> 28:46.960
Bullshit.

28:46.960 --> 28:47.360
Really?

28:47.360 --> 28:47.600
Yeah.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.840
Yeah, well, that's a great segue, Trav.

28:50.640 --> 28:51.520
Tell me about it.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.960
Well, Hulu Plus, you watch all your favorite shows anytime, anywhere.

28:54.960 --> 28:59.520
So whether you're sitting in front of, you know, your Xbox or you're in your hotel room

28:59.520 --> 29:03.760
the night after your wedding making love, you can watch Hulu Plus anywhere.

29:03.760 --> 29:04.320
Oh my God.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.440
It all streams in HD, right?

29:07.440 --> 29:08.080
That's what I've heard.

29:08.080 --> 29:08.640
That is correct.

29:09.200 --> 29:13.760
And Hulu Plus has a lot of your favorite shows like Saturday Night Live Community and Family Guy.

29:13.760 --> 29:14.720
You can also check out.

29:14.720 --> 29:19.360
There's an original program like The Awesomes from SNL Seth Meyers and Moon Boy,

29:19.920 --> 29:21.680
which stars Chris Haddad from Bridesmaids.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.880
They also have, you know, not just TV shows.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.560
They have films on there too.

29:26.560 --> 29:30.480
And it's only $7.99 a month and you can stream.

29:31.280 --> 29:32.400
That's ridiculous.

29:32.400 --> 29:32.880
I know.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.880
Like, how are they possibly making money?

29:34.880 --> 29:38.080
Except for the fact that I guess you don't use it up by watching the TV show.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.800
So that's actually a non-profit actually.

29:40.800 --> 29:42.080
So they're not making money.

29:42.080 --> 29:45.600
It's just everybody should be seeing Parks and Rec.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.760
So it's like a government-provided service.

29:47.760 --> 29:51.440
I'm amazed that they're keeping it afloat despite the government shutdown.

29:52.080 --> 29:52.800
Here's better news.

29:52.800 --> 29:57.680
You can try it free for two weeks when you go to huluplus.com slash my brother.

29:58.480 --> 30:01.600

30:03.840 --> 30:06.960

30:07.920 --> 30:11.440
And, you know, any website you go to just end up with slash my brother

30:11.440 --> 30:12.480

30:12.480 --> 30:14.000
Maybe we got a bonus for you.

30:14.000 --> 30:14.480
It's hard to say.

30:14.480 --> 30:18.720
Guys, I got a message for Zoe from Alden who says,

30:18.720 --> 30:21.440
happy birthday to the best sister and one of my best friends.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.560
Sorry it's a little late.

30:22.560 --> 30:23.040
My bad.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.640
Her birthday was September 25th.

30:24.640 --> 30:25.600
God damn, Alden.

30:27.040 --> 30:28.640
Dangest by a mile.

30:29.200 --> 30:32.240
Of course, part of that is because we're recording so late, but hey.

30:32.240 --> 30:34.000
Thank you for introducing me to MBMBAM,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.880
by which I mean playing it in the car until I gave in and started downloading

30:37.760 --> 30:39.360
and listening to it myself.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.040
Now, it's a favorite podcast of mine.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.160
Here's to another great year.

30:42.160 --> 30:42.800
I love you.

30:42.800 --> 30:47.360
Man, I love when people do advertisements and they advertise us in the advertisements.

30:47.360 --> 30:47.920
It's like double.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.200
Yeah, that's gonna help build our brand.

30:49.200 --> 30:49.760
Double good for us.

30:49.760 --> 30:50.260
No kidding.

30:51.520 --> 30:52.640
That's really great.

30:52.640 --> 30:56.400
Thank you to Zoe for being so considerate and helping to spread the word

30:56.400 --> 30:58.720
about our podcast to people who listen to our podcast.

31:00.080 --> 31:00.880
That's a free plug.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.320
Hey, you know what I like to make my plugs out of?

31:04.320 --> 31:04.800
What's that?

31:05.920 --> 31:07.280
Cow manure!

31:07.280 --> 31:08.960
Farm wisdom!

31:08.960 --> 31:10.160
Farm wisdom!

31:10.160 --> 31:11.120
Sounds awful.

31:11.120 --> 31:15.200
Call and meet your Uncle Jake at the lake farm wisdom.

31:15.200 --> 31:18.320
I wish Jake would stop hanging out in places only that rhyme with him.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.600
So I was like, you want to go to Pizza Hut, Uncle Jake?

31:21.600 --> 31:23.120
He's like, no, can't.

31:23.920 --> 31:27.760
I'll meet you at Cookie Break where they fix your breaks.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.800
So I don't want to go there.

31:30.080 --> 31:30.800
Not cookies?

31:33.280 --> 31:36.560
So wait, at Cookie Break, they fix your breaks?

31:36.560 --> 31:37.840
They don't prepare cookies?

31:37.840 --> 31:40.320
I said Cookie Break.

31:40.320 --> 31:40.960
Cookie Break.

31:40.960 --> 31:41.680
I thought you said Cookie Break.

31:41.680 --> 31:43.920
Man, I wish I could have a conversation with Justin

31:43.920 --> 31:46.720
without him hearing ghost cookie words.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.440
Travis, are you okay?

31:49.440 --> 31:49.920
I am.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.800
It sounds like you're at the bottom of the ocean

31:52.800 --> 31:55.600
and you're trying to bury your microphone in the silt.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.920
It sounds terrible over there.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.320
Do you guys want to hear some farm bullshit?

32:02.960 --> 32:03.520
Yeah, sure.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.160
We were told that this is farm bullshit

32:06.160 --> 32:08.800
and think of it like Yahoo Answers version of farm wisdom.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.520
These are all actual superstitious suggestions for farmers

32:13.520 --> 32:15.840
from the Canadian edition of the Farmer's Almanac.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.280
Oh my God.

32:17.280 --> 32:20.400
Never thank a person for giving you a plant or it will die.

32:20.400 --> 32:25.920
In fact, the best way to ensure that plant slips will thrive is to steal them.

32:25.920 --> 32:27.600
Wow, man.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.720
This is the official Canadian Farmer's Almanac?

32:30.720 --> 32:32.240
It is endorsing larceny?

32:32.240 --> 32:35.280
Peppers should only be planted by a violent tempered person,

32:35.280 --> 32:37.840
a redheaded person, or a person in a bad mood.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.800
I don't think there's anyone in the world

32:40.800 --> 32:42.960
who's not in a bad mood when they're doing chores.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.480
Travis, what is going on?

32:44.480 --> 32:47.760
Flax will grow tall if you show it your buttocks.

32:47.760 --> 32:48.480
Flax.

32:48.480 --> 32:49.840
Okay, come on.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.280
No, this is true.

32:51.280 --> 32:52.640
Flax is fucking nasty.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.360
Flax will trick you too.

32:55.360 --> 32:58.000
Flax will be like, hey, I dropped some flax seed over there

32:58.000 --> 32:58.640
for you to harvest.

32:58.640 --> 32:59.440
It's on the ground behind me.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.040
Why don't you go ahead and pick that up?

33:01.040 --> 33:02.560
Why don't you go ahead and pick that up, girl?

33:03.600 --> 33:05.840
Now this I have problems with.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.920
To cure a founder in a horse,

33:07.920 --> 33:10.640
cut three locks of hair from your private parts,

33:10.640 --> 33:13.280
place them between the halves of an apple or potato,

33:13.280 --> 33:14.720
and feed it to the horse.

33:14.720 --> 33:15.220
Okay.

33:16.480 --> 33:16.980
All right.

33:18.160 --> 33:18.960
Yeah.

33:18.960 --> 33:21.920
So Canadian farmers are basically witches?

33:21.920 --> 33:23.280
Is that what we're getting at here?

33:23.280 --> 33:24.800
And their plants are perverts.

33:26.320 --> 33:29.520
This is why I just have never been able to endorse the practice

33:29.520 --> 33:31.200
of eating Canadian produce.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.080
Because they're all sex-

33:32.080 --> 33:34.080
And they're all full of pubes!

33:34.080 --> 33:34.580
Stop!

33:35.280 --> 33:36.640
You have two apples in your hand.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.400
You're like, um, looks like my horse needs a snack.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.680
What is that, founder?

33:39.680 --> 33:41.280
Let me just shove some pubes up in there.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.160
Wait, shit.

33:42.160 --> 33:44.080
Which apple did I put the pubes in?

33:44.080 --> 33:46.240
Do I cut the red wire or the blue wire?

33:46.240 --> 33:50.640
God, you work so hard to build a relationship with your horse.

33:50.640 --> 33:53.600
Can you imagine the risking that bond,

33:53.600 --> 33:56.800
that eternal like interdimensional bond

33:56.800 --> 33:58.640
by feeding it your own pubes?

33:58.640 --> 34:00.640
Maybe your horse is like, hey, I've got founder.

34:00.640 --> 34:02.160
I don't- I still don't know what that is.

34:02.160 --> 34:04.160
Ah, man, I've got a real bad case of founder.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.040
Hey, Mike?

34:05.040 --> 34:06.400
Hey, Mike, can I ask a favor?

34:07.680 --> 34:08.800
Make us some of that bush.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.320
Mike, I got a weird question for you, buddy.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.640
I know we got a bond, and I don't want to overstep my horse bounds,

34:14.640 --> 34:18.000
but make us- why don't you shave off a couple little sprigs?

34:18.960 --> 34:21.680
Make it a couple sprigs of your zone.

34:22.960 --> 34:23.680
Can you imagine?

34:23.680 --> 34:25.600
Let me paint the horror story for you.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.480
This is the situation that everybody wants to think about.

34:28.480 --> 34:29.680
It's three o'clock in the morning.

34:31.120 --> 34:31.680
What's that?

34:31.680 --> 34:35.600
Is that- hey, hey, Doug, did I- were you asleep?

34:35.600 --> 34:36.480
Hey, sorry, Doug.

34:37.040 --> 34:39.840
Listen, uh, my founder's really-

34:39.840 --> 34:40.880
Really bad over here.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.720
And, uh, really-

34:42.720 --> 34:44.400
Walgreens is already closed.

34:45.200 --> 34:46.880
They had no bush at Walgreens.

34:46.880 --> 34:50.960
They were closed, and I just- I need to get a quick gnaw on your sprigs.

34:50.960 --> 34:52.720
Now, Mike, I can't help it.

34:52.720 --> 34:56.080
This looks like head hair, and I appreciate it,

34:56.080 --> 34:58.240
but I feel like you're trying to dupe me, Mike.

34:58.240 --> 34:58.880
Doug.

34:58.880 --> 34:59.440
Doug Mike.

35:00.800 --> 35:01.680
Mike Doug.

35:01.680 --> 35:02.400
Mike Doug.

35:02.400 --> 35:03.200
I thought we were boys.

35:03.200 --> 35:03.760
Thought we were boys.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.760
Couldn't spare a couple pubos, huh?

35:05.760 --> 35:06.800
I'll watch you in the shower.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.160
I know what you got going on down there.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.600
You got bush to spare, dog.

35:11.360 --> 35:11.840
I'm hungry.

35:11.840 --> 35:12.160
I'm hungry.

35:12.160 --> 35:12.480
I mean-

35:13.600 --> 35:14.640
You got bush for days.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.480
Tuck some of them sprigs in a tater.

35:17.760 --> 35:18.640
Hi, welcome to Denny's.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.400
Would you like to try our new sprigs in a tater?

35:21.280 --> 35:21.780
No.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.200
Welcome to Guy Fieri's Restaurant.

35:26.240 --> 35:27.840
Guy Fieri's Restaurant.

35:27.840 --> 35:28.480
Restaurant.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.120
Try our sprigs in a tater.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.520
Hey, what's up with these little hairs?

35:33.520 --> 35:35.120
They're high lit on the end.

35:36.000 --> 35:36.880
They're high lit on the end.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.400
They've got goggles wrapped around them.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.440
Yeah, that's how you know.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.800
That's how you know it's authentic.

35:43.520 --> 35:44.880
Authentic Fieri cuisine.

35:45.680 --> 35:48.240
I'm Cameron Esposito, the host of Wham Bam Pow.

35:48.240 --> 35:53.200
This is an action and sci-fi movie podcast on MaximumFun.org.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.160
Talk about punching.

35:54.160 --> 35:55.520
We talk about car chases.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.520
We talk about arms.

35:57.520 --> 35:58.880
Muscles that are on arms.

35:58.880 --> 36:01.760
And every week I'm joined by panelist Rhea Butcher.

36:01.760 --> 36:02.480
That's me.

36:02.480 --> 36:05.120
And of course also Ricky Carmona.

36:05.120 --> 36:06.080
Oh, I'm all up in it.

36:06.080 --> 36:06.800
That's what's up.

36:06.800 --> 36:07.920
The Afro Spokesman.

36:07.920 --> 36:11.760
We are gonna give you all of the jokes and all of the happiness

36:11.760 --> 36:14.960
and all of the information that you need to watch action

36:14.960 --> 36:17.120
and sci-fi films to the fullest.

36:17.760 --> 36:21.040
Find it at MaximumFun.org or you can subscribe on iTunes.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.880
I have been married for four years and my wife complained to me today

36:26.880 --> 36:29.200
that I don't tell her she is pretty anymore.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.840
I don't like saying the word pretty and I can't say beautiful

36:31.840 --> 36:33.120
without sounding sarcastic.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.760
What can I say to make my wife...

36:36.880 --> 36:41.360
What can I say to my wife to convince her I still find her attractive?

36:41.360 --> 36:43.440
That's from Still Sexy in Salt Lake.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.600
Hey, you need to start saying pretty.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.040
Just get over it.

36:47.040 --> 36:47.520
How's that?

36:47.520 --> 36:49.040
Actions speak louder than words.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.520
So the action you have to do is saying these embarrassing words

36:53.520 --> 36:54.720
to let your wife know how.

36:54.720 --> 36:55.680
No, because it's true.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.360
You're so pretty.

36:57.360 --> 36:57.920
I don't know.

36:57.920 --> 36:58.960
It doesn't sound good.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.080
And I feel what they're saying.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.840
Like, you look so beautiful.

37:02.640 --> 37:05.280
I feel like a character in the room when I say that word.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.440
Yeah, but the thing is, it ain't about you, dawg.

37:07.440 --> 37:10.080
Like, I feel stupid saying this.

37:10.080 --> 37:11.120
Well, okay.

37:11.920 --> 37:15.680
Like, throughout time, that's like 60% of people in romantic stuff.

37:15.680 --> 37:16.080
Watch.

37:16.080 --> 37:18.160
Like, you do it because she wants you to.

37:18.160 --> 37:18.960
Here's what you do.

37:18.960 --> 37:24.080
You gotta watch the season premiere of any season of The Bachelorette

37:24.080 --> 37:26.960
and listen to the adjectives that these fools drop.

37:26.960 --> 37:27.440
They are-

37:27.440 --> 37:29.040
They're gonna have so many different ones.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.560
They are out of control.

37:30.560 --> 37:31.360
Surprisingly, no.

37:31.360 --> 37:34.880
There's only like two or three alternatives,

37:34.880 --> 37:37.120
but they drop them every other sentence.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.640
You look so stunning.

37:38.640 --> 37:39.840
Doesn't she look stunning?

37:39.840 --> 37:41.200
Look at how stunning she is.

37:42.160 --> 37:43.840
Look at how stunting she is.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.920
She's doing all kinds of sweet tricks.

37:46.560 --> 37:47.920
Look how stunted she is.

37:47.920 --> 37:50.400
She could be like 5'6", 5'7".

37:50.400 --> 37:54.800
Look at her little nubby arms.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.160
Look how stunned she is.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.520
She's just sitting there, mouth agape.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.280
She's just lying there on the floor

37:59.280 --> 38:01.920
because she tried to steal a cop car.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.720
That was a terrible idea.

38:05.360 --> 38:06.640
Look how stumped she is.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.800
That was a great riddle, I told her.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.440
Look at how stumpled she is.

38:11.440 --> 38:12.800
That's a word I just made up

38:12.800 --> 38:16.160
because I'm afraid to say pretty.

38:16.160 --> 38:20.720
Just say pretty.

38:20.720 --> 38:21.600
Move on with your life.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.400
Say pretty.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.520
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

38:23.520 --> 38:23.840
Yes.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.320
This Yahoo was sent in by Alan Black.

38:26.320 --> 38:27.200
Thank you, Alan Black.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.840
It's by Yahoo Answers user Andre who asks,

38:32.160 --> 38:33.280
Nipples tweaked.

38:33.280 --> 38:34.800
Why are guys tweaking my pecs?

38:36.160 --> 38:37.520
Every since I've been working out,

38:37.520 --> 38:39.920
I've developed a lot of chest and pectoral development.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.080
Guys at the gym are tweaking my nipples

38:42.080 --> 38:43.840
and I'm confused as to what that means.

38:43.840 --> 38:46.400
Does it mean keep up the good work or something else?

38:47.520 --> 38:49.600
Oh, he's probably got a sign taped to his back.

38:51.760 --> 38:52.560
I've seen this before.

38:52.560 --> 38:53.040
Tweak them.

38:53.600 --> 38:54.240
Tweak them, please.

38:54.240 --> 38:54.560
Tweak them.

38:55.680 --> 38:56.960
Tweak them, I think.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.160
If I don't have,

38:59.280 --> 39:02.400
I haven't developed my chest and pectoral development much.

39:03.200 --> 39:06.320
When you do that, like do your nipples get like super beefy?

39:07.520 --> 39:08.240
I bet they could.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.280
I bet that's an outcome.

39:09.280 --> 39:12.240
There's probably that, you know, in all those muscle magazines.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.680
I bet that's one of the articles.

39:14.640 --> 39:15.520
Hey, Sam.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.080
Sam, I just want to say your pecs are rocking

39:18.080 --> 39:20.560
and your nips are super inviting.

39:20.560 --> 39:23.520
Your nips are like, they're round like a pepperoncini.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.640
They are winking at me.

39:26.640 --> 39:27.280
You know what I mean?

39:27.280 --> 39:31.360
The actual tipple is like plump, like a pencil eraser.

39:31.920 --> 39:33.440
I guess what I'm saying is daddy likes.

39:33.440 --> 39:34.480
I guess daddy likes.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.640
I have to find out what's up.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.120
I have to.

39:37.120 --> 39:38.320
Do you mind if I just get it?

39:38.320 --> 39:41.520
Like I've been trying to develop my own pectoral development

39:41.520 --> 39:43.920
and like, but my nipples are just doing nothing.

39:43.920 --> 39:47.440
And what's fucked up is that my pecs are getting so big

39:47.440 --> 39:50.480
and so ripped, like two big juicy flank steaks.

39:50.480 --> 39:53.920
My nipples are the same size that they were six years ago.

39:53.920 --> 39:55.760
They're these little like nothing nubbins.

39:55.760 --> 39:56.400
You know what I mean?

39:56.400 --> 39:59.280
They look like little beady chameleon eyes on the tips.

39:59.280 --> 40:00.240
But I'm looking at yours.

40:00.240 --> 40:00.880
I'm looking at yours.

40:00.880 --> 40:01.360
So you know what I see?

40:01.360 --> 40:02.560
Yours like Mount Everest.

40:03.120 --> 40:03.620
Perfect.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.280
Perfect nipples.

40:06.160 --> 40:08.080
Like Olympus rising above the Serengeti.

40:08.080 --> 40:08.560
Am I right?

40:08.560 --> 40:11.120
Mm hmm. Are you showing your nipples enough butt?

40:12.160 --> 40:14.480
Because I think that that could really help to encourage their growth.

40:14.480 --> 40:15.440
What are you talking about?

40:16.000 --> 40:17.280
Who planted your nipples?

40:17.280 --> 40:18.640
Were they redheaded and angry?

40:19.440 --> 40:20.720
Show the nipples your buttocks.

40:21.440 --> 40:24.560
If you can figure out how to show your nipples your own buttocks,

40:24.560 --> 40:27.360
I think that you well, I don't know how your strength training is going,

40:27.360 --> 40:29.360
but your flexibility training is out of control.

40:29.360 --> 40:34.160
I think I need to go ahead and take the biggest loser off my DVR subscriptions.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.560
I do not think I can watch this show anymore in good conscience.

40:36.560 --> 40:39.040
All right, here's the thing.

40:40.240 --> 40:42.000
Yahoo question is asking.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.640
Your problem was the first time one of these dudes tweaked your nipples.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.040
Why didn't you react strongly?

40:49.760 --> 40:53.600
That is that is the unanswered question of this.

40:53.600 --> 40:54.240
You don't want to make it.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.440
You don't want to make a scene.

40:55.440 --> 40:59.840
Well, but it seems like you just went, hmm, you're going to journal about this.

41:00.480 --> 41:02.160
Listen, this is going to sound weird,

41:02.160 --> 41:05.760
but the next time Craig walks by, you have to tweak his nipples.

41:05.760 --> 41:09.040
The expression on his face is absolutely out of control.

41:09.920 --> 41:12.480
It looks like he's eating a sour warhead.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.840
Um, how about another Yahoo since we're in?

41:17.840 --> 41:19.360
Yeah, rapid fire.

41:19.360 --> 41:21.360
Um, this Yahoo was sent in by Ashley Burghardt.

41:21.360 --> 41:22.000
Thanks, Ashley.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.080
It's by Yahoo answers user Jared, who asks,

41:24.640 --> 41:28.080
do people not realize McDonald's is not the only restaurant?

41:28.960 --> 41:32.080
Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell are all across the street.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.880
They were all dead on a night there was a home football game

41:34.880 --> 41:38.320
and a car show you McDonald's had a long line and drive through

41:38.320 --> 41:40.720
and standing room only in the lobby.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.720
We had customers angry because they had to wait longer

41:42.720 --> 41:43.920
than they wanted for their food.

41:43.920 --> 41:46.160
Knowing how busy we were and short staffed.

41:46.160 --> 41:47.520
There's those other restaurants.

41:47.520 --> 41:49.920
Plus the car show and football game had concessions.

41:52.880 --> 42:00.800
I want a McDonald's like a register clerk that chastises you for eating there.

42:01.600 --> 42:02.640
Wow, really?

42:02.640 --> 42:04.480
You couldn't have gotten some tacos at the game?

42:04.480 --> 42:04.960
Oh, wow.

42:04.960 --> 42:05.520
Okay.

42:05.520 --> 42:08.000
With the Panera across the street, you're here, huh?

42:08.000 --> 42:08.720
Huh?

42:08.720 --> 42:09.280
Interesting.

42:09.280 --> 42:10.000
Huh?

42:10.000 --> 42:10.560
More than that.

42:10.560 --> 42:15.120
I want to see, like, maybe there's a, like, his boss is like roaming Yahoo answers

42:15.120 --> 42:16.240
and comes across this question.

42:16.240 --> 42:19.680
It's like, Hey, Craig, Craig, I saw your post.

42:19.680 --> 42:22.800
Um, do you not want us to hit goal this month?

42:22.800 --> 42:25.360
Travis, I'm a small business owner.

42:25.360 --> 42:29.520
So if you could just not capsize my investment, that would be fantastic.

42:29.520 --> 42:31.840
This Ma and Pa McDonald's.

42:31.840 --> 42:35.200
I've been trying to get it off the ground my entire life and I don't need you.

42:35.200 --> 42:36.800
I don't need you sabotaging.

42:36.800 --> 42:39.200
We have worked so hard to get here.

42:39.200 --> 42:41.520
Build brand awareness and recognition.

42:41.520 --> 42:44.080
Do you remember when we went through the whole litigation because we wanted to be

42:44.080 --> 42:46.800
McDonald's with an extra in and they wouldn't let us?

42:46.800 --> 42:50.480
Do you remember how angry everyone was when we didn't have hamburgers on the menu?

42:51.840 --> 42:54.400
Remember our struggles that we've had to overcome?

42:54.400 --> 42:58.560
We had those seasonal bratwurst for a while and I said, Hey, what if we make this the whole thing?

42:58.560 --> 43:04.160
And we became McDonald's Bratwurst Depot and, and God, who knew that McDonald's was so litigious

43:04.160 --> 43:05.360
to its own branches.

43:06.080 --> 43:08.880
Folks, thank you so much for hanging out with us this week.

43:08.880 --> 43:10.800
We hope you've had as much fun as we have.

43:10.800 --> 43:15.760
Uh, I do want to let everybody know that, uh, Griffin brought me back toys from Japan

43:15.760 --> 43:20.160
and included on them in those toys was this button that I could press to make this happen.

43:22.880 --> 43:25.440
And it's a, it's a button that makes a Japanese man talk.

43:25.440 --> 43:25.920
I'm sorry.

43:25.920 --> 43:26.480
I didn't make it.

43:26.480 --> 43:28.640
Better use of that during the program.

43:28.640 --> 43:32.880
I'm going to try to do, but I mean, if the problem was that it's not particularly funny.

43:35.840 --> 43:38.720
Griffin do the thing where you thank the guy for this stuff.

43:38.720 --> 43:41.280
I want to thank John Roderick and the long winters.

43:41.280 --> 43:44.080
I've been thanking him for every episode for maybe a hundred episodes.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.000
So I can't believe Justin can't remember his name.

43:46.640 --> 43:49.920
Um, but, but I John Roderick and the long winters.

43:49.920 --> 43:50.640
Who's he?

43:50.640 --> 43:52.560
I don't think you Ron Jodrick.

43:52.560 --> 43:56.400
I want to thank John Tartrick and the long winters.

43:56.400 --> 43:57.280
I know the band name.

43:58.080 --> 44:01.120
God damn my aphasia, uh, for the use of our theme song.

44:01.120 --> 44:03.120
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

44:03.120 --> 44:04.640
Uh, it's a great band, great album.

44:04.640 --> 44:06.160
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

44:06.160 --> 44:08.000
Like Lindsay, Sarah Ingram, Holly L.

44:08.000 --> 44:14.880
Peacock, Ben Sherman, Michael Collins, Corinne McShane, Schmoe Z, uh, dead.

44:14.880 --> 44:16.240
Yell corpse Edo.

44:16.240 --> 44:17.840
I don't think that's her actual name.

44:17.840 --> 44:22.880
Uh, but, uh, thank you to everyone spreading the word.

44:22.880 --> 44:27.680
Thanks for the short kind of weird, maybe a bit unpolished ep.

44:27.680 --> 44:31.840
Now that all the weddings and traveling are done for like two fucking months.

44:32.880 --> 44:33.760
This is a bonus.

44:33.760 --> 44:35.040
This is a bonus episode.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.160
I didn't know this was going to happen.

44:37.040 --> 44:40.400
Uh, yeah, thanks for, thanks for sticking by us thick and thin.

44:40.400 --> 44:41.200
We'll get it together.

44:41.760 --> 44:44.320
We just got to stop getting married for like a second.

44:44.320 --> 44:48.640
If we could just go one month without a wedding, that would be ideal.

44:48.640 --> 44:52.400
