00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.080
Hello, everybody, and welcome to my Brother by Brother Meat Advice Show for the modern era.

00:48.080 --> 00:54.080
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-oldest brother, Travis.

00:54.080 --> 00:57.680
Are we doing the baseball thing? Travis McElroy, McElroy.

00:57.680 --> 01:01.440
I'm your friend, McElroy, your baby brother. Welcome home. Welcome back.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.440
Yeah, so-

01:03.440 --> 01:06.960
Chet, thanks, everybody, for checking in on my die-die sort of stuff,

01:06.960 --> 01:10.720
what was going on there vis-a-vis bone ejection.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.480
Bone loss slash time loss.

01:12.480 --> 01:17.920
Is brain loss, but I'm feeling great. Brains and bones intact. Thank you all for your concern.

01:17.920 --> 01:23.120
Thank you for the Get Well cards. Thank you for the health soup that you sent to my house.

01:23.120 --> 01:24.240
You presumably sent.

01:24.240 --> 01:28.320
We have finished week one of our Hollywood lifestyle. We've done it.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.720
Here's the thing. We got two more episodes. This episode and the next episode of Move In

01:32.720 --> 01:37.200
Maybe Game here is us all together recording after doing TV show shooting

01:37.760 --> 01:42.800
all week. And just to all of my friends in the business, the red carpet business,

01:42.800 --> 01:48.800
I just want to say hats off to you for being able to grind out the products that we know

01:48.800 --> 01:51.760
and we love so much. I'm talking about Cheers. I'm talking about Frasier.

01:51.760 --> 01:57.520
Yeah, and I also appreciate all the support calls we've gotten from Kelsey Grammer and Ted Danson.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.120
Welcome to the club, boys.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.320
Yeah, we were there once. Now it's your time. We got a lot of those calls,

02:02.320 --> 02:05.440
which I appreciated a lot. David Borealis called me.

02:05.440 --> 02:10.480
Kelsey Grammers called me on my phone. He said, time for me to die now.

02:10.480 --> 02:15.840
And I said, whoa, shit, Kelsey, no, no, there's really no reason. No, that's how it goes.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.560
And you open the door and Kelsey Grammer is standing outside. If I remember correctly,

02:18.560 --> 02:23.200
it's getting outside. You're holding a literal torch that he passed to you and then dropped dead.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.640
And then he died right there.

02:24.640 --> 02:31.680
Bob Euker card that played fight song when I opened it. And he's like, this is your moment.

02:31.680 --> 02:32.480
This is your time now.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.080
Travis, who did you kill and consume?

02:34.080 --> 02:38.000
It was David Borealis, who I actually think is still making bones. So I think I have to go

02:38.000 --> 02:38.640
beyond bones now.

02:38.640 --> 02:39.600
I think you're on, oh shit, Travis.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.520
No, I think your bone is trained and pulled in the station.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.160
Are you sure?

02:42.160 --> 02:43.360
I haven't heard a lot of buzz.

02:43.360 --> 02:44.960
Then I've got to go do bones too.

02:44.960 --> 02:49.120
Either bones is off the air or bones has become relatively buzz free.

02:49.120 --> 02:53.520
I think it may be the second, which is a shame because I actually really like bones.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.240
Love bones.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.880
So this is our Bones Review podcast.

02:56.880 --> 03:01.200
It's just so good. It's so much fun to see it from like the science side, you know?

03:01.200 --> 03:07.200
I'm feeling legitimately pretty drained from the television making process. The TV shows,

03:07.200 --> 03:09.520
I'm happy to report, were pretty okay at it.

03:09.520 --> 03:14.000
Yeah, it's going pretty well. Most of that is because we have like a really rocking crew.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
We have an incredibly good team of people.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.720
So listen, I often find myself wondering, when famous people who have a lot of projects

03:22.720 --> 03:26.480
going on do podcasts, I often find myself wondering, why are they so bad?

03:26.480 --> 03:29.920
Much like you, a lot of you out there have probably wondered like,

03:30.800 --> 03:31.680
why is this so bad?

03:31.680 --> 03:32.880
I found out the reason this week.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.440
Because they were fucking working.

03:35.440 --> 03:39.920
Because they're doing work all week and then they do a podcast and they're not working.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.240
When the podcast is you're working, it's a lot easier.

03:42.240 --> 03:42.960
It's a lot easier.

03:42.960 --> 03:50.080
It's a lot easier to do one hour of work a week versus we have done five 12-hour days in a row.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.960
Yeah, so I feel like we're all drained and not in the right headspace.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.240
I'm not drained.

03:54.240 --> 03:59.520
I just, let me hand you this bottle of fluid. Can you read the label on the bottle?

03:59.520 --> 04:01.440
That's right, it's Michael's secret stuff.

04:02.720 --> 04:07.120
Only it's comedy juice so it's Michael Richards and his secret stuff is racism.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.400
Do you think that they'd still be able to use the Michael's secret stuff goof

04:10.400 --> 04:16.800
in like post like everyone worried about doping like 2016 America

04:16.800 --> 04:20.080
without like the Monstars being like, hey, you can't do that.

04:20.080 --> 04:22.480
I don't think the Monstars can fucking get on anybody for cheating.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.160
They're cheating as rowdy as punch around.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.040
They did seal the souls of Monty.

04:25.040 --> 04:27.680
Are you gonna drink Michael Richards' piss or not?

04:28.560 --> 04:31.920
I bought that on Etsy for six dollars.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.280
I don't want to get it twisted.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.640
I don't want to make you confused.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.080
I'm not feeling drained.

04:36.080 --> 04:40.000
I've been doing this show for five days and I'm just so sick of my fucking shit.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.560
You know who I thought was the least funniest person in the world

04:44.560 --> 04:47.280
before we started doing this television show?

04:47.280 --> 04:48.000
I don't know.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.440
Probably like Matt Lauer or somebody like that.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.480
Do you know who it is now?

04:52.480 --> 04:53.040
Who?

04:53.040 --> 04:55.920
Griffin Andrew McElroy, one of the hosts of my brother.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.920
Oh man, I fucking hate that guy's jokes and comedy.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.840
I'm actually a really big fan of my stuff.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.200
I just feel like day by day I've just been getting better and better,

05:05.200 --> 05:10.320
like a fine wine, like a well-aged cheesecake.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.520
Should we get into what we do?

05:12.320 --> 05:14.240
I was going to say the best, but we just do it.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.600
Do a question.

05:15.600 --> 05:16.560
Read me a question, please.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.520
Here comes a question.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.000
I have a quick question for you.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.720
My husband left me in charge of his office aquarium

05:22.720 --> 05:24.640
while he has gone away on a business trip.

05:24.640 --> 05:28.640
I'm not saying mistakes were made, but all of his fish are dead now.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.200
Oh my god.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.080
He's coming back in a couple of days.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.960
So how do you think I should play this one out?

05:34.960 --> 05:36.080
That's from Sincerely.

05:36.080 --> 05:36.400
Oops.

05:36.960 --> 05:39.360
Sincerely, Cory from Boy Meets World.

05:40.640 --> 05:40.960
Yeah.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.360
Sincerely, Boris Simpson.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.680
This is a real pickle dickle you got yourself in, I think.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.960
A real fickle dick.

05:48.960 --> 05:52.240
I think what we've got here is we've got to do one of those like branch question things

05:52.240 --> 05:53.840
where it's like, if you ask, go to here.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.680
Or it's like, did your husband actually like these fish?

05:57.680 --> 05:58.800
If the answer is no.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.280
You're good.

05:59.280 --> 05:59.760
You're so good.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.280
You've got to free him from a prison

06:01.280 --> 06:03.920
that he can start to do himself during an ill-conceived moment.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.080
Oh yeah, maybe he was just like, you know what my office needs?

06:06.080 --> 06:06.640
A fish tank.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.560
And just like The Sims, he just dropped it.

06:08.560 --> 06:12.240
Except unlike The Sims, you can't just like then go, no, and sell it back.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.920
I'm gonna let him piss himself to death.

06:13.920 --> 06:14.400
Yeah.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.480
And so maybe, okay, second question.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.920
If you like this fish, yes.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.520
Second, how much?

06:19.520 --> 06:22.960
Because if the answer is a lot, now you got to get into some shenanigans.

06:22.960 --> 06:27.120
If it was like a little bit, you can replace those fish and he will never know.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.480
Yeah, if it's a lot, then we move into a new sphere of the Venn diagram

06:30.480 --> 06:33.440
because this is the most confusing diagram that's ever been drawn up.

06:33.440 --> 06:37.040
And then that circle of Venn diagram is, say, calm, hilarious.

06:37.040 --> 06:37.600
Yeah.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.280
This is, well, I need to get the fish.

06:39.280 --> 06:42.160
And then it turns out he's taught the fish to come when called.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.200
And these won't do it.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.320
And he's worried that they're sick.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.960
So then you have to take them to the fish doctor together.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.440
And the fish doctor is like, but I thought you said these were boys.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.320
These are girl fish.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.040
Fuck these.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.400
This is really good.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.760
This is gonna be a really good episode.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.880
Well, that's from the new episode of Kevin Can Wait starring Kevin James.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.280
What if, here's one.

06:59.280 --> 07:07.440
When he comes home, you open one of those big silver domes that have dinners underneath it,

07:07.440 --> 07:09.840
and inside is two tiny fish fillets.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.600
And you say, you're welcome.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.560
One day when the boss get hungry, guess who's gonna be on the plate.

07:14.560 --> 07:14.960
Exactly.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.400
I worked really hard on this.

07:16.400 --> 07:20.320
And he'll be so touched by how hard you worked on this fish dinner.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.040
He won't even think about the fact that you used his fish for it.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.400
And you can just insist that that's what you thought they were for.

07:26.400 --> 07:32.720
For real though, if I had pet fish and those motherfuckers ate it, I would want to eat.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.840
I think I want to eat them.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.440
That's the only pet other than a bird.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.200
But it'd have to be a big bird.

07:39.200 --> 07:44.000
I'm not trying to work my mouth around a parakeet's body for a long time trying to find a good gristle.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.920
But a clownfish, I'll fuck one of them up.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.200
I would have to know that it happened, like on their terms.

07:53.200 --> 07:58.160
That the fish led a good life, lived to its fullest, lived every day like they were dying,

07:58.160 --> 07:58.960
and then died.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.160
And then were deep fried.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.520
How would you have any knowledge of-

08:01.520 --> 08:02.960
Live every day like you're frying.

08:02.960 --> 08:09.680
What if you, like, what if the fish had died from something dangerous to humans?

08:10.240 --> 08:10.960
What do you mean?

08:10.960 --> 08:12.240
Like humanitis or something.

08:12.240 --> 08:12.720
They die from that.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.560
Oh, they got a bad case of humanitis, huh?

08:14.560 --> 08:15.360
Gunshot wounds.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.320
One tiny gunshot wound.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.960
Yeah, that's why these fish are bit by a vampire.

08:18.960 --> 08:23.360
Yeah, they got a bad case of GSWs and you don't want to pass that on to your husband.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.520
We're going to have to get fish CSI in here.

08:25.520 --> 08:26.800
CSI Atlantis.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.240
You're not saying mistakes were made.

08:28.240 --> 08:32.560
So that leaves two solutions, in my mind, for what did happen.

08:32.560 --> 08:34.640
First of all, it wasn't a mistake.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.400
It was cruel intentions.

08:36.400 --> 08:42.800
And you wanted to have sex with your step sister, I guess, and murder a bunch of fish.

08:42.800 --> 08:43.840
That's possible.

08:43.840 --> 08:49.440
The other option is that just like sometimes life has a crazy way of doing stuff.

08:50.080 --> 08:54.160
And it was a crazy game of poker and all of these fish spontaneously died at the same time.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.880
Then you've got like a happening kind of scenario.

08:56.880 --> 09:00.560
All of them were the same, just destined to die at the same day.

09:00.560 --> 09:01.280
What?

09:01.280 --> 09:05.200
One day when I was a little boy, when I was a little boy, I had three teeth fall out in

09:05.200 --> 09:05.920
the same day.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.400
Crazy.

09:06.400 --> 09:07.600
What are the odds it'll happen?

09:08.400 --> 09:12.640
In the same vein, all 30 of these fucking fish just happened to be their time.

09:12.640 --> 09:17.680
The thing that's very troubling about it is that there's not a number of fish.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.880
That's what's bothering me.

09:18.880 --> 09:24.160
Because if you said I killed a couple of his fish, I killed his two fish, I killed his

09:24.160 --> 09:26.320
fish, that's all fine.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.680
All his fish.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.040
All his.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.240
None shall pass.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.840
None live to this.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.240
This is like a Crimson Tide sort of situation.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.360
I have an idea.

09:35.360 --> 09:39.920
Very rarely are we, the McElroy brothers, able to offer any kind of real actionable

09:39.920 --> 09:40.880
concrete help.

09:40.880 --> 09:45.040
I would like to offer here our services as a scapegoat for this.

09:45.040 --> 09:45.440
Okay.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.600
How could we have possibly fucked up all these fish?

09:47.600 --> 09:51.680
Well, they played our podcast and they left it on accidentally overnight.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.280
The fish went insane and just killed each other.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.200
The hippie laughed themselves?

09:57.200 --> 09:57.680
That was it.

09:57.680 --> 10:01.200
The fish forgot that they couldn't breathe air and they came up to the top to listen

10:01.200 --> 10:03.120
closer like, what did they say?

10:03.120 --> 10:04.400
And they drowned in air.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.400
Wait, I think they're going to talk about elf.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.120
Wait, hold on.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.280
And they forgot to breathe.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.480
The one topside.

10:10.480 --> 10:14.160
Do you know how many people have died from forgetting to breathe while listening to our

10:14.160 --> 10:14.660
podcast?

10:15.680 --> 10:18.800
Sometimes I think about, and we've done a lot of great work here, but we've probably

10:18.800 --> 10:24.240
killed dozens of people who were just listening so intently for the next good elf joke that

10:24.240 --> 10:25.440
they just stopped living.

10:25.440 --> 10:25.920
Hi.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.360
We've had a lot of fun here today.

10:27.360 --> 10:32.480
Here, we'll do a breathe here and now hold your breath because here comes a fucking fresh

10:32.480 --> 10:35.200
Yahoo and don't even breathe in the middle of it or else it's bad luck.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.400
This one's sent in by level9000.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.440
Yajur Jiru, Davenport.

10:37.440 --> 10:38.240
Thank you, Jiru.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.480
It's by Yajur Answers User.

10:40.480 --> 10:42.240
This website doesn't even fucking load anymore.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.960
This website doesn't even fucking load anymore.

10:44.960 --> 10:53.520
It's like, I go to like five websites and one of them has terminal, they don't give

10:53.520 --> 10:54.320
a fuck-itis.

10:56.480 --> 11:01.280
Melissa Mayer has her hand firmly on a knob and the knob when we started doing this podcast

11:01.280 --> 11:05.360
was at 10 and it's been that way for a long time and she started to creep that knob counter

11:05.360 --> 11:09.200
clockwise down into the zero position.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.920
She's turning up the squelch knob on the IHU.

11:11.920 --> 11:15.360
Okay, anyway, it's not loading so we'll say Parnell asks.

11:15.360 --> 11:20.480
Chris Parnell asks, how to convince my teacher to start vape club?

11:23.760 --> 11:25.840
No, no further info.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.480
How to convince my teacher to start vape club?

11:28.480 --> 11:28.880
What else?

11:28.880 --> 11:30.000
What the fuck else do you need to know?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.520
I feel like I know everything about this person.

11:31.520 --> 11:36.720
Can I tell you just hands down before we go any further, the best part of vape club?

11:36.720 --> 11:37.280
What's that?

11:37.280 --> 11:38.640
It's going to be the field trips.

11:38.640 --> 11:39.440
What do you mean?

11:39.440 --> 11:40.640
It's going to be sick.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.320
Well, you can go to different vape stores.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.280
Go to vape stores.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.680
Maybe find the vape store that started it all.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.800
I don't think kids are allowed in vape stores or maybe they are.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.040
I don't know.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.480
I've been out of the scene for a while.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.800
Is vaping, listen, bad for you?

11:53.760 --> 11:55.440
A lot of people aren't quite sure about that.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.480
It's not enough concrete research.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.440
I will say this.

11:57.440 --> 12:00.240
There's no concrete research is bad for how you look.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.520
This is true.

12:02.240 --> 12:06.640
That's a tough look to pull off is pulling a rip off a fucking chunky lightsaber,

12:06.640 --> 12:13.040
pulling a big fucking bundle, a big bushel of cotton off a lightsaber,

12:13.040 --> 12:17.360
and then blasting out your mouth while you're just chilling with your family at Applebee's.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.200
It's a hard look to pull off.

12:20.560 --> 12:24.880
Leo DiCaprio can't fucking like Leo's out there vaping on the reg

12:24.880 --> 12:27.920
and he's trying to get like vapers rights like going and thank you,

12:27.920 --> 12:31.360
Leo, for laying down on the barbed wire for the rest of us.

12:31.920 --> 12:35.360
Hey, homie, you can't pull the look off, Leo.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.520
Put the lightsaber down, Anakin.

12:37.520 --> 12:41.120
He actually turned his Oscar into like the biggest vape rig in town.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.720
He just bored straight through the senate.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.400
That's why he wanted it so badly.

12:44.400 --> 12:44.960
Do you know that?

12:45.760 --> 12:49.760
You're saying he turned his only Oscar that he worked for 40 years to get

12:49.760 --> 12:52.720
into a big nasty foam blaster.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.160
Yeah, just the chunkiest ripper.

12:56.160 --> 13:00.240
It's just the fattest, shiniest, most prestigious cotton gin.

13:04.960 --> 13:09.520
How do I convince, hey, yo, teach, got a hot new club idea for you

13:09.520 --> 13:10.800
and it's coming at you now.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.520
Check out this fucking cool piece of machinery.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.560
It's called a vape.

13:16.560 --> 13:22.080
In that scenario, do you approach the coolest teacher in the school

13:22.080 --> 13:26.400
or go the other way, the least school teacher who needs it the most?

13:26.400 --> 13:27.200
Intriguing.

13:27.200 --> 13:31.520
So Mr. Jefferson, you've been trying to up your profile with the teens for a while.

13:31.520 --> 13:36.000
I've seen some of your snapchats and we'll talk about those in a bit.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
But first, how about a little booster shot of coolness in the way of this,

13:40.000 --> 13:41.680
my friend, an e-cigarette.

13:43.280 --> 13:43.680
What?

13:43.680 --> 13:48.080
There's certain, but to Travis's point, though, you could also run your odds

13:48.080 --> 13:52.240
on getting the coolest teacher who's most likely to be down

13:52.240 --> 13:55.440
and getting a teacher so old and out of it

13:55.440 --> 13:59.440
that I think that they just couldn't process how cool it is when you vape.

13:59.440 --> 14:03.520
They wouldn't be able to process the ideas of it as, oh, clouds are in there.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.840
Well, it would have to be a science teacher.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.520
I think a science teacher would be very, very fascinating.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.240
I'm talking about the mustache nerd man from Stranger Things,

14:10.240 --> 14:11.760
who's like, who lets the kids-

14:12.880 --> 14:15.280
Oh, when he gives the whole lesson about how the flea vapes?

14:15.280 --> 14:15.680
Yeah.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.080
This is how the flea vapes.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.600
Look at that chunky rip.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.960
You're thinking about it on two-

14:20.960 --> 14:23.600
The rips can be chunky, but they're not funky.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.280
You're thinking of it on too small a scale.

14:25.280 --> 14:30.240
I think that if your school vape club, it can get real good.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.080
It's just ripping that big C.

14:32.880 --> 14:33.840
Big buffers.

14:34.560 --> 14:37.280
Then it can become a kind of point of pride for the whole school, right?

14:37.280 --> 14:38.560
Or you can take it to state.

14:38.560 --> 14:42.320
Our school's football program here at Vape U is not good,

14:42.880 --> 14:44.560
but you know what we are good at?

14:44.560 --> 14:48.480
We're good at making that fucking cumulonimbus.

14:48.480 --> 14:48.880
Bring it on.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.440
So you go to the vape competition against your rivals

14:51.440 --> 14:55.600
and you just blow them out of the water with literal big chunky nimbus boys.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.200
And then, yeah, now all of a sudden you're the jock.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.160
Now all of a sudden you're the homecoming.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.120
You're the vape jock.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.240
You're the homecoming prince.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.840
It's just like a screenplay I'm writing,

15:09.840 --> 15:12.400
and I'm looking for any collaboration between you fuckers.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.320
Do you think you can get Freddie Prinze Jr.?

15:14.320 --> 15:17.440
I think Freddie Prinze Jr. probably loves vaping.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.280
What celebrities do you guys secretly think

15:19.280 --> 15:21.520
love to fucking rip cotton every day?

15:21.520 --> 15:24.720
All right, Travis, we'll say the names at the exact same time.

15:24.720 --> 15:25.440
Three, two, one, go.

15:25.440 --> 15:25.840
You ready?

15:25.840 --> 15:26.080
Yeah.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.000
Three, two, one, go.

15:28.000 --> 15:28.880
Jason Segal.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.120
Johnny Depp probably pulls big clouds.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.720
I feel like Johnny Depp probably pulls huge-

15:34.720 --> 15:35.920
You don't think Jason Segal?

15:35.920 --> 15:38.960
Okay, this is a new quiz show on My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

15:38.960 --> 15:42.160
I'm just inventing this quiz show to help eat up time, okay?

15:42.160 --> 15:43.360
So this is the quiz show.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.400
Travis and I, I'm going to count to three, I'm going to say go,

15:47.040 --> 15:50.240
and then Travis is going to say a name of a celebrity.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.040
I have to top him with a celebrity who is more likely-

15:53.040 --> 15:54.720
That is definitely more likely than-

15:56.400 --> 15:57.440
Can I participate in this game?

15:57.440 --> 15:58.000
I don't know why I'm being excluded.

15:58.000 --> 15:58.720
I feel like you're judging.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.240
No, we'll go around Robin.

16:00.240 --> 16:00.720
We'll go around Robin.

16:00.720 --> 16:01.600
Yeah, you're judging.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.880
Okay, first one is Justin and I,

16:02.880 --> 16:05.040
then we'll do Justin and Griffin, then we'll do Griffin and Travis.

16:05.040 --> 16:05.440
Here we go.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.360
I'll try to top the top winner that you guys put in.

16:07.360 --> 16:07.680
Okay.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.320
Okay.

16:08.320 --> 16:08.800
You ready?

16:08.800 --> 16:09.520
Count down, Justin.

16:09.520 --> 16:10.640
Because I fucking got it.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.560
I have one that I think is going to win out.

16:12.560 --> 16:13.680
Three, two-

16:13.680 --> 16:14.160
Who's starting?

16:14.160 --> 16:14.720
Travis is starting.

16:14.720 --> 16:15.360
Okay.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.520
Three, two, one, go.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.320
Rider strong.

16:19.600 --> 16:20.320
Oh boy.

16:20.320 --> 16:20.640
Yeah.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.360
You gave me too much time to think.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.360
Your one mistake was letting me live.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.760
For each one, I mean, it's good.

16:27.760 --> 16:28.960
I can't put a number on it.

16:28.960 --> 16:29.840
No, no, no, no.

16:29.840 --> 16:32.160
You count it off and I have to try to beat Travis.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.520
If I don't, he wins.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.880
Okay, three, two, one, go.

16:36.880 --> 16:37.680
Corey Feldman.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.280
Oh my God.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.640
That's really good.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.640
That's really good.

16:42.640 --> 16:43.600
That's really good.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.800
Travis, your rebuttal.

16:45.360 --> 16:46.640
Okay, give me a count.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.280
Three, two, one, go.

16:49.280 --> 16:49.840
Lil Wayne.

16:52.800 --> 16:53.520
Here's the thing.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.560
Yes, yes, yeah.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.400
I mean, but that one's like, yeah.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.440
I think he was probably vaping.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.520
He was maybe the first person to start vaping.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.640
So like, I would give you that.

17:00.640 --> 17:05.600
But I did just Google Corey Feldman vape and I got a news alert from-

17:05.600 --> 17:06.640
A news alert?

17:06.640 --> 17:11.920
A news alert from Podcat that says Corey Feldman on, quote, totally vaping awesome.

17:13.360 --> 17:15.280
Okay, you win this round, Justin.

17:15.280 --> 17:15.760
Okay.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.160
Okay, everyone who just listed is out.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.120
Justin versus Griffin.

17:19.120 --> 17:20.240
Justin, you gotta go first.

17:20.240 --> 17:20.880
You ready?

17:20.880 --> 17:21.360
Yes.

17:21.360 --> 17:23.680
Three, two, one, go.

17:23.680 --> 17:24.400
Jake Busey.

17:25.280 --> 17:25.520
Who?

17:26.240 --> 17:26.960
Jake Busey.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.640
Gary Busey's son, Jake Busey.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.080
It's kind of a deep cut, but okay.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.680
I mean, I'm about to end this fucking game forever.

17:33.680 --> 17:34.400
Okay, you ready?

17:34.400 --> 17:35.840
Griffin, rebuttal.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.840
Three, two, one, go.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.120
John Leguizamo.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.440
How's your fucking clouds, John?

17:43.440 --> 17:47.120
Justin just literally physically reeled backwards from that hit.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.720
That is not a joke.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.560
So fucking nasty.

17:50.560 --> 17:53.280
Okay, Justin, you have one chance to rebut.

17:53.280 --> 17:53.760
Wait, hold on.

17:53.760 --> 17:54.320
Can't be done.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.200
Can't be done.

17:55.200 --> 17:59.280
Let me just dig deep and see if I got anything in the tank.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.400
All right, just give me a second.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.600
You have four seconds.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.000
You ready?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.360
No, no, don't say four seconds.

18:03.360 --> 18:04.640
You don't have that much time, Justin.

18:04.640 --> 18:05.040
I'm sorry.

18:05.040 --> 18:05.920
Time is ticking away.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.760
I'll pause the recording if I have to, please.

18:07.760 --> 18:08.160
Okay.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.560
Just give me a second to think, because Griffin's been sitting on John Leguizamo.

18:10.560 --> 18:11.520
Justin's crying.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.320
He's weeping.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.160
Griffin's been sitting on John Leguizamo for like a full minute.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.040
Nobody vapes harder than Johnny Legs, babe.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.240
Okay.

18:18.240 --> 18:18.800
No.

18:18.800 --> 18:19.680
Justin, I'm sorry.

18:19.680 --> 18:20.320
Your time is up.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.840
You're gonna have to name it in three, two-

18:21.840 --> 18:24.160
I'll tell you when I'm ready.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.840
No, that's not how the game works, Justin.

18:25.840 --> 18:26.720
This is an infinite time.

18:26.720 --> 18:27.520
Justin, you've been beaten.

18:29.520 --> 18:33.840
Three, two, one, go.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.600
Carrot top.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.000
Come on.

18:38.000 --> 18:38.720
That's real.

18:38.720 --> 18:39.520
Okay.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.560
I need you to Google it.

18:40.560 --> 18:41.760
Let's go to the Google tape.

18:41.760 --> 18:45.760
If I Google carrot top vape and you get a result, I'll call you the winner.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.360
Okay, so the top-

18:49.360 --> 18:50.720
Well, no, this is not-

18:50.720 --> 18:51.600
This is a parody.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.440
This is a mean, awful parody account.

18:54.160 --> 18:54.640
No.

18:54.640 --> 18:55.680
No, that's not real.

18:55.680 --> 19:03.760
There is a YouTube video on how to vape a carrot, parenthesis, easy, parenthesis, no knife required.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.800
What is the fucking backwards scenario?

19:08.800 --> 19:09.760
What's the use case?

19:09.760 --> 19:10.320
Yeah, yeah.

19:10.320 --> 19:13.280
I want all this juice and this battery and this heater, I guess.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.760
Travis, I need your opinion.

19:15.760 --> 19:16.640
John Leguizamo wins.

19:16.640 --> 19:17.440
John Leguizamo wins.

19:17.440 --> 19:17.920
I'm sorry.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.360
If we had had any conclusive-

19:20.320 --> 19:23.440
If I get a single vape result for John Leguizamo, I'm sorry.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.920
If I get a single vape result for John Leguizamo-

19:25.920 --> 19:26.720
You won't, but it doesn't-

19:27.520 --> 19:29.600
Listen, I'm the judge in this scenario, Justin.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.080
I'm sorry.

19:30.080 --> 19:30.560
That's right.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.880
All right, now, motherfuckers, now it's on.

19:32.880 --> 19:33.440
Griffin, you gotta go first.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.640
Griffin, you're leading off.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.480
Oh, God, we're doing me and Travis?

19:36.480 --> 19:37.440
Yeah, of course we are.

19:37.440 --> 19:37.920
All right.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.480
Three, two, one, go.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.760
President, that's right, Bill Clinton.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.840
Oh, okay, that's pretty good.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.280
Okay, I've got one.

19:51.280 --> 19:51.600
Okay.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.720
Okay.

19:52.720 --> 19:53.280
Count it down.

19:53.920 --> 19:57.200
Three, two, one, go.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.000
Russell Brand.

19:58.640 --> 19:59.280
Well.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.320
Well, I'm not sure.

20:00.320 --> 20:00.800
See, I think-

20:00.800 --> 20:01.280
Oh, no, he's-

20:01.280 --> 20:05.040
Rebuttal, three, two, one, Russell Crowe.

20:05.040 --> 20:05.760
Fuck!

20:05.760 --> 20:08.480
I don't think that that's even accurate.

20:10.640 --> 20:11.680
My worry is that-

20:11.680 --> 20:12.800
None of these are good.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.360
Three, two, one, Bill Paxton.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.080
Oh, wait, fuck, okay, wait.

20:18.080 --> 20:18.720
Count me down.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.240
Okay, three, two, one-

20:20.240 --> 20:21.280
Oh, Travis is hot.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.400
Randy Quaid.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.600
Randy Quaid probably has a bandolier of vapes.

20:26.240 --> 20:26.880
Yeah, sure.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.760
I think we've got about everything we're gonna get out of this game.

20:29.760 --> 20:30.080
All right.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.200
But thank you for coming up with it.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.120
It is a fun game you can play with your friends at home.

20:33.120 --> 20:33.360
Yeah.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.400
Who do the-

20:34.400 --> 20:35.360
It's called Who Do Vape?

20:35.360 --> 20:36.640
It's called Most Likely to Vape.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.200
Vape Awards.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.120
Vape Escape.

20:41.120 --> 20:41.680
Vape who?

20:43.040 --> 20:45.760
I've managed to befriend the guy at the restaurant near my work

20:45.760 --> 20:48.080
by repeating the things my coworkers say about sports.

20:48.080 --> 20:48.880
Oh, God.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.760
I get falafels there about twice a week and notice other people

20:51.760 --> 20:54.560
who are chumming with him get a drink at no charge, whereas I do not.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.840
I only want a soda if I don't have to pay for it,

20:57.840 --> 21:01.600
but I can only tell if it's going to be free if I ask for one.

21:02.880 --> 21:06.080
If you really seem to like my sports regurgitation today,

21:06.080 --> 21:08.000
I'll take a risk and ask for soda.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.320
But so far, I've ended up having to pay for each of them.

21:10.960 --> 21:14.000
How can I tell you when our friendship has crossed the line

21:14.000 --> 21:19.600
into free soda range, the FSR, and how can I get it there faster?

21:19.600 --> 21:21.360
That's from Nervous in Nebraska.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.600
Hey, dog.

21:23.600 --> 21:27.120
There's a really busted way to think about another person.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.480
That's a crazy-

21:28.480 --> 21:31.680
People aren't like the soda vending machine

21:31.680 --> 21:34.960
that you put enough fucking sports nuggets into.

21:35.840 --> 21:36.400
I'm sorry.

21:36.400 --> 21:40.080
That'll be 10 more sports before you can have a free Coke.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.960
I guarantee you falafel guy's not thinking of it that way.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.880
You'd be like, I don't know, that was pretty good,

21:44.880 --> 21:45.520
but not exactly-

21:45.520 --> 21:47.680
He's not a fucking bridge troll

21:47.680 --> 21:50.000
whose sports riddles you have to conquer

21:50.560 --> 21:52.560
before you can get a Dr. Pepper on the fridge.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.880
Yeah, what if falafel guy is awesome?

21:54.880 --> 21:56.640
What if falafel guy's great?

21:56.640 --> 21:58.720
All my friends are friends with falafel guy.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.240
Yeah, it's because they ask about his kids.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.200
They don't just say,

22:01.200 --> 22:04.400
Chad Pennington, big strong arm on that boy, huh?

22:04.400 --> 22:06.800
How about a Dr. Pepper, thank you.

22:06.800 --> 22:07.440
Maybe that's it.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.960
Maybe you keep regurgitating sports,

22:08.960 --> 22:11.520
but he wants to talk about the latest episode of Down in Abbey,

22:11.520 --> 22:13.920
or he wants to talk about your theories

22:13.920 --> 22:16.480
on what's really going on in King and Killer Chronicles.

22:16.480 --> 22:17.120
You know what I mean?

22:17.120 --> 22:18.480
And he's like, I guess sports.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.840
Yeah, football's great.

22:19.840 --> 22:23.280
I cannot fathom floating out sports trivia

22:24.320 --> 22:26.320
that there is a chance of follow-up

22:26.320 --> 22:27.760
where I would just have to like-

22:28.640 --> 22:30.240
You don't think he's better than Beerson?

22:32.000 --> 22:32.560
I'm smashed.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.960
There is no player named Beerson.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.680
Ah, you've still got your free soda.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.960
Yeah, I guess you're not a Kremlin spy, as I suspected.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.760
Congratulations, compatriot.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.840
Do you think, Justin, on the spot right now,

22:45.840 --> 22:48.400
could you give me a sports nugget

22:48.400 --> 22:50.160
to earn some sort of favor from me?

22:50.720 --> 22:52.640
Could you give me a sports nug right now?

22:52.640 --> 22:54.000
A sports nug right now?

22:54.000 --> 22:54.720
Right now.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.240
Current sports nug.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.360
Current sports nug.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.000
Some tough injuries in the preseason, huh?

23:04.560 --> 23:05.360
That's good.

23:05.360 --> 23:06.080
That is true.

23:06.080 --> 23:06.640
That is true.

23:06.640 --> 23:07.600
I mean, that's always true.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.680
Tony Romo broke his fucking back.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.720
This is good.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.560
That's an astute observation.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.960
Then, okay, and then I would give you a soda for that.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.080
Did you hear about Tony Romo?

23:16.080 --> 23:16.720
Like, yes.

23:17.520 --> 23:20.320
Of course I heard about Tony Romo and his sad back.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.480
Oh, maybe you give some form of analysis

23:22.480 --> 23:24.000
that no one else has and you say like,

23:24.000 --> 23:25.440
hey, did you hear about Tony Romo's back?

23:25.440 --> 23:26.560
And he's like, yeah, it's really bad.

23:26.560 --> 23:28.480
And you're like, I'm just worried about his kids.

23:28.480 --> 23:29.840
He'll never dance again.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.040
And then the guy's like, what?

23:31.040 --> 23:32.880
He's like, yeah, he dances all the time.

23:32.880 --> 23:33.840
You compound it.

23:33.840 --> 23:37.520
Like, the back is so important for a football bone.

23:37.520 --> 23:37.920
Yeah.

23:37.920 --> 23:42.240
What was that, you got three important football bones.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.120
And I'm going to tell you this,

23:43.120 --> 23:44.320
and I might get thirsty in the middle.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.560
So if you just want to get me a bark soup, you're ready.

23:46.560 --> 23:49.520
Anyway, three important football bones, arms,

23:49.520 --> 23:52.000
use them for catching, stiff arming, throwing,

23:52.000 --> 23:53.200
all very, very important.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.120
Number two, and this is not in order

23:55.120 --> 23:56.560
because I think number two is number one,

23:56.560 --> 23:58.800
but the back is really, really good.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.480
It's sort of what connects all the other

24:00.480 --> 24:02.000
very, very important bones.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.240
And I think it's like what sends your thoughts

24:04.240 --> 24:05.840
to the rest of your body to do them.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.520
Anyway, the third one is your skull, I guess,

24:09.520 --> 24:10.880
because it's where your brain lives.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.000
Very important.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.280
Hey, do you guys want a Yahoo?

24:13.280 --> 24:14.480
Absolutely.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.320
This one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

24:16.320 --> 24:17.360
Keep it waving, Morgan Davey.

24:17.360 --> 24:20.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jesse, who asks,

24:21.280 --> 24:24.160
the Ghostbusters theme won't stop playing

24:24.160 --> 24:25.920
on my computer nonstop.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.680
No application or background app is being used.

24:29.680 --> 24:30.240
Help.

24:31.680 --> 24:35.120
The Ghostbusters theme, it just won't stop playing

24:35.120 --> 24:36.320
on my fucking PC.

24:36.880 --> 24:40.400
There's no apps playing the Ghostbusters theme.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.720
I've closed out Ghostbusters.exe.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.720
That one's definitely, it's not,

24:44.720 --> 24:46.240
and it's not running in the background.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.120
No application or background app is being used.

24:49.120 --> 24:49.620
Help.

24:50.800 --> 24:53.840
It could be like the most ironic ghosts in the world.

24:53.840 --> 24:54.880
Oh, that's funny.

24:54.880 --> 24:55.840
That's a fun.

24:55.840 --> 24:57.600
That's a fun ghost who's just like,

24:57.600 --> 24:59.200
yeah, I like it too.

25:00.400 --> 25:00.720
I'm not.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.880
Here's a dirty secret about us ghosts.

25:02.880 --> 25:06.640
Our favorite song, Ghostbusters.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.560
It also makes us feel good.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.400
Busting is a two-way street.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.640
Busting gives ghosts orgasms.

25:12.640 --> 25:13.520
Did you know that?

25:13.520 --> 25:15.280
Busting makes them feel good.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.560
Why do you think they call them Slimer?

25:17.920 --> 25:22.240
We can't talk about Slimer's sexual proclivities again.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.600
Busting makes ghosts cum.

25:24.320 --> 25:24.880
That's true.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.040
My business is finished.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.600
That's the only thing that makes ghosts cum.

25:31.600 --> 25:35.360
Do you know that they're getting spun around in those lasers?

25:35.360 --> 25:37.760
They're like, not too quick, Ray.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.040
Please make it last.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.760
I don't want to think about Ghostbuster cum.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.800
Ghostbusters don't cum.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.320
All Ghostbusters are eunuchs.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.040
They're castrated when they take up the mantle.

25:51.040 --> 25:52.160
But ghosts do.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.120
They can't be tempted.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.960
Not after the glow job.

25:56.960 --> 26:02.800
That's the one thing they don't tell you about ghosts.

26:02.800 --> 26:03.760
What is that?

26:03.760 --> 26:04.400
They're nasty.

26:04.400 --> 26:08.160
And I think that's the main purpose for our podcast existing.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.120
Just trying to get the word out.

26:09.120 --> 26:10.000
Just trying to get the word out.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.040
Ghosts are going to come at you left, right, and genital words.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.200
So keep an eye out before they munch on you.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.880
What other things could cause the Ghostbusters theme

26:18.880 --> 26:20.480
to be playing constantly on your computer?

26:23.680 --> 26:26.240
I think Edward Snowden is like, I think he's bored.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.120
I think Edward Snowden's probably pretty fucking bored right now.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.840
He's just killing time until the movie drops and he's psyched.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.440
He cannot wait to get the word out.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.960
By the way, this is our sort of way of saying, get to theaters.

26:39.520 --> 26:40.480
Get to Snowden.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.640
Please love Snowden.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.920
It's a pretty good combo of Snowden and JGL.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.640
It's got JGL in it.

26:48.640 --> 26:53.040
And we're all just going to have a fucking great time at Snowden this summer.

26:53.040 --> 26:53.680
Oh, yeah.

26:53.680 --> 26:57.280
Do you think that the Ghostbusters theme song playing in the background of your computer

26:57.280 --> 26:59.600
is like really guerrilla marketing for Snowden?

27:00.400 --> 27:02.160
That's kind of a weird myth.

27:02.160 --> 27:02.800
We've hacked it.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.960
Well, maybe they're partnered with Ghostbusters.

27:05.760 --> 27:06.240
Is it possible?

27:06.240 --> 27:08.080
You know how sometimes there are sister movies?

27:08.080 --> 27:10.800
And Stone is a sister movie to the Ghostbusters?

27:10.800 --> 27:14.640
You know, maybe this person doesn't have a computer and they've just gone bust crazy.

27:15.840 --> 27:16.880
You know what I mean?

27:16.880 --> 27:20.640
It's like, it's such a catchy tune that's like on loop in their own brain.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.040
He just stares at the wall all day long.

27:23.040 --> 27:23.840
He's singing.

27:23.840 --> 27:28.240
He stares at that dumb cardboard computer you made and sings the Ghostbusters.

27:28.240 --> 27:33.600
And it's just a cardboard computer and it's written on the screen, no Ghostbusters.

27:34.640 --> 27:35.600
That's weird.

27:35.600 --> 27:40.160
He uses a literal mouse to try to click on the screen on all those Ghostbuster related

27:40.160 --> 27:40.400
apps.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.200
Let's go to Buddy's end.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.280
What if there's a new iTunes?

27:43.280 --> 27:45.920
Wait, clip that out.

27:45.920 --> 27:46.640
Go ahead, Griffin.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.240
What if they updated iTunes with the new stuff?

27:50.240 --> 27:52.720
I don't watch the press conferences anymore.

27:52.720 --> 27:58.320
But there's a new secret iTunes that runs underneath the subroutines of your computer,

27:58.320 --> 27:58.960
hiding deep.

27:58.960 --> 27:59.840
J-Tunes.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.440
It's called Guy-Tunes.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.720
It's a mean Guy-Tunes that play pranks on you.

28:04.720 --> 28:08.480
It's called iTunes, except there's a number in there.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.120
It's called iTunes, T-O-O-N-S.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.000
It's very whimsical.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.920
iTunes, and he's a little prankster.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.600
Hi, I'm Guy-Tunes.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.720
I live in your computer.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.040
Why is there so much Shakira playing?

28:19.040 --> 28:20.240
It's not mean Guy-Tunes.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.600
It's regular iTunes.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.840
I can't find the photos of my wedding anywhere.

28:23.840 --> 28:24.640
I deleted them.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.160
You're a dick.

28:26.800 --> 28:30.400
No, listen, I deleted your wedding photos on Guy-Tunes.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.440
That's pretty cute.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.440
Why are you fucking Amelie now?

28:33.440 --> 28:35.520
Why are you fucking encroaching?

28:35.520 --> 28:37.120
Now I've got a new voice.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.480
I'm Guy-Tunes.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.720
Busting makes ghosts come.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.280
Guy-Tunes, too, by now, is a lot snarkier.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.640
The kids are gonna love him.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.240
I don't work on your phone.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.080
Okay, Guy-Tunes, why are you even here?

28:48.880 --> 28:50.560
Apple's kind of lost their way.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.360
Hey!

28:51.360 --> 28:55.120
Much like one of my favorite podcasts, My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

28:55.760 --> 28:58.480
I don't have My Brother, My Brother, and Me anymore.

28:58.480 --> 28:59.200
Shit them out.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.640
They went Corpo.

29:00.640 --> 29:01.520
They went what?

29:01.520 --> 29:03.520
Yeah, they got a TV show, went Corpo.

29:04.080 --> 29:05.440
They went Corpo Christie.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.800
I don't want to hear them no more.

29:08.640 --> 29:09.440
Let's go to Mason.

29:09.440 --> 29:21.360
We're sponsored and powered by MeUndies this week,

29:21.360 --> 29:23.280
and I'm going to teach you something I've never done before.

29:23.280 --> 29:23.760
Oh, yeah.

29:23.760 --> 29:26.000
I'm not going to fucking look at the copy at all.

29:26.000 --> 29:26.320
Hell yeah.

29:26.320 --> 29:26.720
You got it?

29:26.720 --> 29:27.520
You doing it?

29:27.520 --> 29:28.080
Hell yeah.

29:28.080 --> 29:28.640
You know what?

29:28.640 --> 29:30.160
Pants off, dance off.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.600
Everybody's wearing MeUndies.

29:31.600 --> 29:32.480
What are you doing?

29:32.480 --> 29:34.480
I'm staring at my brother's crotches.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.000
Okay, we're not staring.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.240
Just appreciating.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.560
We're, we've recorded a TV show this week.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.640
12 hour days, five days in a row.

29:42.640 --> 29:45.840
I refuse to go in to do the TV show without MeUndies on.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.440
I've worn MeUndies every day.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.960
I will continue to do MeUndies.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.360
If I do not have a clean pair of MeUndies ready for the show,

29:51.360 --> 29:54.000
I will cancel that day's filming until MeUndies are clean.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.680
This is a Travis McElroy guarantee.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.280
I did an episode not in MeUndies,

29:57.280 --> 30:00.000
and it was at the end of the day like a rag

30:00.000 --> 30:02.880
they used to clean up all the tables out of Wendy's.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.440
They used really good fabric and they're really comfortable

30:05.440 --> 30:07.200
and they look really great on everybody

30:07.200 --> 30:08.480
and they're really super cool.

30:08.480 --> 30:09.680
Get out, go away.

30:09.680 --> 30:10.480
Go away, cat.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.640
We're talking about underpants in our underpants.

30:14.000 --> 30:14.640
We're back.

30:14.640 --> 30:15.760
The cat is gone.

30:15.760 --> 30:16.160
Justin.

30:17.600 --> 30:17.840
What?

30:17.840 --> 30:18.800
Take your pants off.

30:18.800 --> 30:19.440
Are you wearing MeUndies?

30:19.440 --> 30:21.120
I'm not wearing MeUndies today.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.640
I'm not taking my fucking pants off.

30:22.640 --> 30:23.760
Are you wearing any Undies?

30:23.760 --> 30:25.520
No, listen, now you have to take your pants off

30:25.520 --> 30:28.080
so we can fucking shame you for not wearing the good underwear.

30:28.080 --> 30:29.360
Are you wearing any Undies?

30:29.360 --> 30:30.400
This is important.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.200
Yes, I'm wearing Undies.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.040
Take them off and let's see what you've got on.

30:33.040 --> 30:33.760
I don't want to take them off.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.600
Justin, take off your fucking pants.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.520
He's doing it.

30:37.520 --> 30:37.920
Here we go.

30:37.920 --> 30:38.480
Here we go.

30:38.480 --> 30:39.280
What are we working with?

30:39.840 --> 30:41.440
Oh, he's going way too slow.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.160
Oh, I see.

30:42.160 --> 30:42.400
Okay.

30:42.400 --> 30:43.440
Well, these are non-

30:43.440 --> 30:44.160
We can't say that.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.120
Don't say the brand name on it.

30:45.120 --> 30:47.120
These are non-MeUndies.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.000
Oh, Justin.

30:48.000 --> 30:48.640
They're just like that.

30:48.640 --> 30:49.440
That's why I keep...

30:49.440 --> 30:51.520
If you guys have wondered why through this whole...

30:51.520 --> 30:52.560
I'm just going to leave them off.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.040
This is good.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.920
This is actually, I'm trying to say, this is kind of nice.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.920
If you guys have been wondering why through the whole episode

30:57.920 --> 31:00.720
I've been mouthing you, my dick is itchy.

31:00.720 --> 31:01.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:01.760 --> 31:04.080
It's just because you're wearing like a bag down there.

31:04.080 --> 31:06.320
It does look like a burlap sack.

31:06.320 --> 31:06.960
Yeah.

31:06.960 --> 31:09.520
And why did they sew so many zippers into it?

31:09.520 --> 31:10.160
I don't know.

31:10.160 --> 31:10.720
I'll never know.

31:10.720 --> 31:14.000
But this, I will look back at the copy here because shipping in the US and Canada...

31:14.800 --> 31:18.800
Shipping is free in the US and Canada and you can save $8 a pair with the MeUndies subscription

31:18.800 --> 31:20.080
plan, which is a really good deal.

31:20.080 --> 31:23.680
You should do it because eventually the dream is you get to like basic zero.

31:23.680 --> 31:26.400
You just wipe out all your bad undies and they're all good MeUndies.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.440
The singularity.

31:27.440 --> 31:31.360
And you can get a subscription or a single pair and get 20% off your first order when

31:31.360 --> 31:37.120
you go to MeUndies.com slash my brother, that's MeUndies.com slash my brother for 20% off your

31:37.120 --> 31:37.520
order.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.800
MeUndies.com slash my brother.

31:38.800 --> 31:39.120
Do it.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.960
Griffin, tell me about fucking Squarespace.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.880
I'm going to tell you all about fucking Squarespace.

31:42.880 --> 31:45.280
But first I got a question for you boys.

31:45.280 --> 31:45.600
Yes.

31:46.160 --> 31:50.160
Do you think Anderson Cooper has like a really little skinny vape that he uses?

31:50.160 --> 31:52.320
Yeah, but I bet it's really long.

31:52.960 --> 31:55.520
I bet it's really nice and really long and really great.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.840
All right, here comes an ad for Squarespace.

31:57.840 --> 32:03.040
Squarespace, it's just all that you need to put together something like a landing page

32:03.040 --> 32:06.080
or a beautiful gallery or professional blog or an online store.

32:06.080 --> 32:07.920
It's all included with your Squarespace website.

32:07.920 --> 32:12.160
Say you want to start a website in which people can submit two different celebrity names and

32:12.160 --> 32:15.040
then do a poll of who thinks that they vape the best.

32:15.040 --> 32:19.520
That's the new hot or not vape or nape.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.160
Well, that's good.

32:20.160 --> 32:20.880
Vapornape.com.

32:20.880 --> 32:23.200
Do you guys think I can get Vapornaut.com right now?

32:23.200 --> 32:24.000
Vapornaut.com.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.480
Wait, listen, this is happening live.

32:26.480 --> 32:27.840
Vapornaut.com.

32:27.840 --> 32:28.560
We're going to use it.

32:28.560 --> 32:29.840
Don't go to the website.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.200
I just want to try to register it.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.800
Okay, don't go to it.

32:32.800 --> 32:37.280
I'm just saying that this is how fast and easy it is and then you can build it on Squarespace

32:38.080 --> 32:43.680
because creating websites on Squarespace is simple.

32:43.680 --> 32:44.720
Jesus, you still fucked it up.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.480
I know, but listen, Squarespace is so good.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.880
It's where we built macroshows.com.

32:48.880 --> 32:54.320
I've known nothing about like website computer sites and I made it really good.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.320
Clearly, that's what you're calling me.

32:56.320 --> 33:00.320
I've never made a computer site before in my life and I made macroshows.com and it turned

33:00.320 --> 33:04.720
out very well and it's so easy to make changes on an update and everything and you should

33:04.720 --> 33:09.440
go check out Squarespace and you can start your free trial today at Squarespace.com

33:09.440 --> 33:14.000
slash my brother and you get 10% off your first purchase if you go to Squarespace.com

33:14.000 --> 33:14.880
slash my brother.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.560
They have great seamless commerce tools.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.320
You can actually make money off your website.

33:18.320 --> 33:21.120
Their customer support is like beyond compare.

33:21.120 --> 33:24.400
It's amazing, beautiful templates, custom designs, all kinds of shit.

33:24.400 --> 33:25.120
Go check it out.

33:25.120 --> 33:26.080
Squarespace.com.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.040
You're going to love it.

33:27.040 --> 33:27.360
All right.

33:27.360 --> 33:30.480
I found a website that can generate two random celebrities at will.

33:30.480 --> 33:31.600
Let's start with this first one.

33:32.560 --> 33:33.920
This is just a trial test for vape or not.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.040
You can play a line at home.

33:35.040 --> 33:38.000
Number one, Ben Affleck or Marilyn Monroe.

33:39.840 --> 33:40.960
That's kind of a tricky one.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.960
That's kind of a gimme.

33:42.960 --> 33:43.760
If she could.

33:43.760 --> 33:44.400
If she could.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.200
That's a good question.

33:45.200 --> 33:46.400
This has nothing to do with death.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.400
Vape transcends death.

33:49.600 --> 33:50.800
Oh, this is good.

33:50.800 --> 33:51.600
Okay, fuck.

33:51.600 --> 33:54.320
Now, Justin, you're going to hear this one and you're going to think you know the answer,

33:54.320 --> 33:56.400
but I really need you to sit on it.

33:56.400 --> 33:59.040
Howard Stern or Jennifer Garner.

34:02.320 --> 34:02.560
Okay.

34:02.560 --> 34:03.520
Here's the thing, though.

34:03.520 --> 34:03.760
Yeah.

34:04.560 --> 34:10.080
Howard Stern is in an enclosed space for many, many hours each day during his workday.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.760
I don't think he could be vaping in there.

34:11.760 --> 34:12.400
Oh, yeah.

34:12.400 --> 34:12.880
That's a good point.

34:12.880 --> 34:17.200
You rip some chunky cotton in the face of like whoever you had in studio that day.

34:18.480 --> 34:19.920
This is a really, really good one.

34:19.920 --> 34:20.960
This is tough, Justin.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.160
I need you to really buckle down on this one.

34:22.160 --> 34:22.720
Dial in.

34:22.720 --> 34:23.520
Give it to me.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.480
Hulk Hogan or Ian McKellen.

34:27.680 --> 34:29.680
Sir Ian McKellen or Hulk Hogan.

34:29.680 --> 34:30.480
Who vapes?

34:30.480 --> 34:34.240
In this case, it's who vapes the most because they definitely both rip cotton.

34:34.240 --> 34:35.200
Here's the thing.

34:35.200 --> 34:41.600
I've seen one of those human beings depicted blowing gigantic ship cotton.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.200
Gigantic starship cotton.

34:43.920 --> 34:46.000
Like there's no question it's Ian McKellen.

34:46.000 --> 34:46.400
Correct.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.280
Of course it is.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.320
Yeah, he can make boats and shit.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.280
Just one last one.

34:49.280 --> 34:55.200
Kristen Stewart of the Twilight movies or Michael Jordan, the dunk man himself.

34:56.080 --> 34:56.480
Mr.

34:56.480 --> 34:56.960
Dunkster.

34:56.960 --> 34:57.680
That's what I call him.

34:57.680 --> 34:58.000
Mr.

34:58.000 --> 34:58.320
Hoops.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.800
That's why he retired finally.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.240
He's like, I have a new sport.

35:03.280 --> 35:05.520
I have got a new challenge for the feet.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.960
And he's using I've got to go slay a new dragon.

35:08.960 --> 35:14.320
That motherfucker can stand on the half court line and he can take in a deep, deep billowing

35:14.320 --> 35:17.360
breath and he can get it into the hoop from from there.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.200
And it's it's remarkable stuff.

35:19.200 --> 35:19.680
Okay.

35:19.680 --> 35:23.200
Tristan Stewart should not be discounted, though, because I bet she can rip mad cotton.

35:23.200 --> 35:23.920
Yeah.

35:23.920 --> 35:25.760
Troubling news has just come in.

35:25.760 --> 35:28.720
Vapor not is taken.

35:28.720 --> 35:29.280
Damn it.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.440
Who vapes dot com is taken.

35:33.040 --> 35:37.520
You guys got any like what are we going to star vape star vape stars who vape?

35:37.520 --> 35:39.440
How about star vape stars?

35:39.440 --> 35:41.440
Which star vapes which stars?

35:41.440 --> 35:42.480
Which one vapes?

35:42.480 --> 35:43.200
Which one vape?

35:43.200 --> 35:43.920
Which one is vapes?

35:43.920 --> 35:44.080
Great.

35:44.080 --> 35:46.160
Because then we can spend it off to like amateur.

35:46.160 --> 35:47.760
Oh, here's one battle of the Pauls.

35:47.760 --> 35:49.600
Again, this is just a random celebrity generator.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.080
But Paul Rudd or Paul Newman.

35:52.080 --> 35:52.560
Fuck.

35:52.560 --> 35:56.240
Paul Newman would look so cool with a fucking big fat rig hanging out of his mouth.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.680
It's probably Paul Newman.

35:57.680 --> 35:58.720
So here's what here's what.

35:58.720 --> 36:06.320
OK, so here's Danica Patrick, the race car driver or Jay Leno, the race car driver, race

36:06.320 --> 36:08.240
car driving, vaping cool guy.

36:08.240 --> 36:12.000
OK, so here's the way I think here's here's here's what I got.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.080
I got which one vapes dot com.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.760
And I think that's very good.

36:15.760 --> 36:18.480
Now, here's here's the way I think which one of these works.

36:18.480 --> 36:21.600
I will get to we got a little bit more in the money zone.

36:21.600 --> 36:26.320
We're going to say which one vapes, I believe, is two options.

36:26.320 --> 36:28.960
You can log on to help us categorize stars.

36:28.960 --> 36:32.160
And so a picture of a star comes up and you have like a fun slider.

36:32.160 --> 36:35.040
By the way, this is how fucking Facebook got started.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.840
Yeah, so I might be excitement is through the roof.

36:37.840 --> 36:41.520
Yeah, so you can you rate the stars, right?

36:41.520 --> 36:42.960
But it's on one of ten.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.880
How likely is it that they vape?

36:44.880 --> 36:50.160
And then the other one is a contest where you have two stars in front of you and you

36:50.160 --> 36:52.240
have to choose which one probably vapes.

36:52.240 --> 36:55.680
I guess the winner or loser is based on community voting.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.360
So it's all theoretical.

36:57.360 --> 37:00.320
I love this because what I love about that is you don't like if there's someone who's

37:00.320 --> 37:03.760
like a one like Allison Hannigan, I don't think Allison Hannigan vapes.

37:03.760 --> 37:04.160
Right.

37:04.160 --> 37:06.000
Probably like how Allison Hannigan.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.840
I'm not just saying this because they're both redheads.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.440
They just happen to be brought to my head.

37:09.440 --> 37:11.360
Allison Hannigan versus Felicia Day.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.840
I feel like that's a good like I couldn't choose.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.560
But that's what I'm saying between the two, who's most likely is tough.

37:16.560 --> 37:18.640
So you want to categorize it in one to ten.

37:18.640 --> 37:24.480
So you get two ones against each other where you don't like Allison Hannigan versus, you

37:24.480 --> 37:26.240
know, Bill Clinton.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.120
Like, that's too obvious.

37:27.120 --> 37:27.920
You know what I mean?

37:27.920 --> 37:28.080
Yeah.

37:28.080 --> 37:33.920
If you select if you build the tech for this and you want that redirect, just get at me.

37:33.920 --> 37:34.800
We'll set it up.

37:34.800 --> 37:37.840
We'll get which one vapes and listen and then we'll retire.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.840
Please, after you make it, please write the bar.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.000
I'm like, this this was just for laughs.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.560
This is not legally binding.

37:44.560 --> 37:45.680
This is not legally binding.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.240
People know.

37:46.240 --> 37:49.680
But for real, though, A-Rod or Marissa Tomei.

37:49.680 --> 37:52.160
I'm in love with this random celebrity generator.

37:52.160 --> 37:55.040
Yo dog, Denzel Washington or Dustin Hoffman.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.800
That's actually a really tough one.

37:56.800 --> 37:57.840
That would be a tough one.

37:57.840 --> 37:58.720
Which one would vape?

37:59.520 --> 38:03.680
Man, I feel like Dustin Hoffman would try vaping for like three weeks and decide it's

38:03.680 --> 38:04.400
not for him.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.600
That seems like his jam.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.440
OK, so we got a little Jumbotron message.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.040
OK, we got a Jumbotron here.

38:11.040 --> 38:16.960
This is for Bill Buehler and it's from Matthew, Emily, Morgan and Blake.

38:16.960 --> 38:19.440
Merry Christmas 2015, Bill.

38:19.440 --> 38:20.640
Oh, God.

38:20.640 --> 38:21.840
Whoops.

38:21.840 --> 38:22.880
Whoops a daisy.

38:22.880 --> 38:25.600
We thought we said no presents last year, but perhaps not.

38:25.600 --> 38:30.320
Your thoughtfulness and our awfulness aside, let's hope let's let the McElroy say thank

38:30.320 --> 38:31.680
you for your gifts for us.

38:31.680 --> 38:36.080
Hopefully hearing it from the brothers takes the edge off the shocking delay.

38:36.080 --> 38:42.320
And while we're here, happy birthday, September 1st, and no presents in 2016.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.080
We kind of missed it on both.

38:44.080 --> 38:46.400
I feel like they're trolling us with this one.

38:46.400 --> 38:50.000
This feels like a troll to me because I don't know how we would make it nine months.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.760
We're not gestating over here.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.280
We're just answering questions.

38:55.280 --> 38:59.120
We're getting our Jumbotrons through the Pony Express at this point.

38:59.120 --> 39:00.560
So we apologize for all this.

39:00.560 --> 39:05.840
I got a message for Dan and it's from Beth and it says, hey, Dan, would it surprise you

39:05.840 --> 39:07.200
to hear that I'm sleepy?

39:07.200 --> 39:12.560
Thanks for being my organic alarm clock at five thirty a.m. each day so I can get to

39:12.560 --> 39:13.280
work.

39:13.280 --> 39:16.080
I'm sorry for being a morning Beth each time.

39:18.640 --> 39:19.840
But could you give me a minute?

39:20.480 --> 39:23.440
I feel like a snoozy koala being kicked out of a tree sometimes.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.360
Just steal the Duna.

39:25.360 --> 39:26.320
Trust me, I'll get up.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.760
All of this is a no idea.

39:29.760 --> 39:31.120
Beth, what's a Duna?

39:31.120 --> 39:35.200
Listen, we here at McElroy Industries do not endorse stealing the Duna.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.160
Don't steal the Duna.

39:36.160 --> 39:36.880
Don't steal the Duna.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.560
That's my favorite childhood board game.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.320
Don't steal the Duna.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.960
OK, as near as I can tell, Duna is a car seat.

39:43.520 --> 39:47.440
So, OK, this has been sent to us by a hyper aware sentient baby.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.280
Oh, it's one of those babies.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.400
Super baby geniuses.

39:50.400 --> 39:51.440
Super genius babies.

39:52.480 --> 39:53.760
What's the deal with Brexit?

39:53.760 --> 39:54.960
Have you seen Happy Valley yet?

39:54.960 --> 39:58.400
How do British people pronounce Edinburgh, Leicester or Norwich?

39:58.400 --> 39:59.120
Not like that.

39:59.120 --> 40:03.120
Are you tired of getting your world news from reliable sources, often with no puns or sexual

40:03.120 --> 40:03.760
innuendo?

40:03.760 --> 40:06.560
Why was there a butcher's hat haunting Coronation Street?

40:06.560 --> 40:07.760
What's Coronation Street?

40:07.760 --> 40:09.680
And why is Dave Holmes obsessed with it?

40:09.680 --> 40:14.240
International Waters pairs a team of comedians in LA against a team of comedians in London

40:14.240 --> 40:16.240
in a pop culture battle royale.

40:16.240 --> 40:21.440
Join us once a fortnight to hear the best comedians in the world trade jokes and stories

40:21.440 --> 40:24.000
and maybe even learn something at the same time.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
International Waters with me, Dave Holmes.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.520
Find it at maximumfun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

40:29.520 --> 40:34.880
Um, do you guys want to go?

40:34.880 --> 40:35.440
Uh, yeah.

40:35.440 --> 40:35.840
Go ahead.

40:35.840 --> 40:36.320
That's what I said.

40:36.320 --> 40:36.880
And I keep it.

40:36.880 --> 40:39.920
I want a munch munch.

40:39.920 --> 40:40.880
You guys are right across from me.

40:40.880 --> 40:41.360
You can help me out.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.160
Well, I did it.

40:42.160 --> 40:44.240
It's hard for me to get on board because here's the thing.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.520
You know me, dog.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.360
You know, I love the munch squad.

40:47.360 --> 40:53.200
But one thing about the munch squad is that it's a it's very rude because it's a rude bit.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.800
But that's why it hypes up the energy.

40:54.800 --> 40:58.240
If you cause you're a rude, crude dude, here we go.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.840
So let's try.

40:59.840 --> 41:00.800
I want a munch squad.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.400
No, I'm saying squad.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.360
You say squad.

41:03.360 --> 41:05.040
I want a munch squad.

41:07.360 --> 41:10.400
I want to munch squad.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.600
Welcome to Munch Squad.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.280
This is a show within a show.

41:13.280 --> 41:14.560
You're joining us here.

41:14.560 --> 41:15.520
You're joining us here.

41:15.520 --> 41:17.520
I'm bringing you the latest in fast food trends.

41:17.520 --> 41:17.760
Fuck.

41:17.760 --> 41:20.480
But can I just real quick Paul McCartney or Adam Sandler?

41:22.640 --> 41:23.840
I'm Sir Paul McCartney.

41:23.840 --> 41:24.400
Check this out.

41:24.400 --> 41:28.800
That was my Adam Sandler.

41:28.800 --> 41:29.360
Oh, that was?

41:30.080 --> 41:33.600
I guess I did a little song Paul McCartney would sing while he vapes out a coffee.

41:33.600 --> 41:37.040
I feel like Paul McCartney would just sit and say,

41:37.040 --> 41:39.040
is a vape trick called Penny Lane?

41:39.040 --> 41:40.800
And he just inhaled and exhale.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.080
And he thinks that's a vape trick.

41:42.080 --> 41:44.080
And he just keep naming them after Beatles songs.

41:44.080 --> 41:44.880
That's really good.

41:44.880 --> 41:45.520
That's so good.

41:45.520 --> 41:47.680
He would play the fucking flute solo on it.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.400
His vape rig is the flute that they play in Penny Lane.

41:50.400 --> 41:56.800
So this is a show within a show where I highlight the latest and greatest

41:58.400 --> 42:00.960
in fast food evolution.

42:00.960 --> 42:02.320
And not just that.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.600
I don't just tell you about the items.

42:04.160 --> 42:05.440
What I tell you is-

42:05.440 --> 42:08.080
He throws that he buys them and throws them directly in a toilet.

42:08.080 --> 42:09.200
No, I don't try them myself.

42:09.200 --> 42:13.680
I listen to the experts, the professionals in marketing

42:13.680 --> 42:18.640
and the executive branch of each of these outlets and what they say.

42:18.640 --> 42:20.880
I need you to drive that concept home more, Justin,

42:20.880 --> 42:22.480
because we routinely get people like,

42:22.480 --> 42:25.840
why don't you try those new Cheeto Dorito cheese things?

42:25.840 --> 42:27.520
No, we don't try shit.

42:27.520 --> 42:30.240
I tell you what the people who are making them say about them

42:30.240 --> 42:31.920
because they are the experts, okay?

42:32.560 --> 42:36.240
So today it's salad from Domino's.

42:36.240 --> 42:36.720
Oops.

42:36.720 --> 42:37.280
Oops.

42:37.280 --> 42:38.880
Okay, I was raved with that, Trace.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.680
Now here is the quote.

42:41.680 --> 42:45.760
This one comes to us from Joe Jordan, chief marketing officer at Domino's.

42:45.760 --> 42:47.760
Actually, before I bring you that,

42:48.400 --> 42:50.240
let me tell you what we're looking at here.

42:50.240 --> 42:52.400
Well, Justin, Justin, let me stop you right there.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.600
I'm kind of a healthy boy, so I'm pretty sure I know

42:55.600 --> 42:57.120
what we're dealing with vis-a-vis salads.

42:57.120 --> 42:58.000
Yeah, you don't.

42:58.000 --> 42:58.560
Yeah, okay.

42:58.560 --> 43:04.480
So we got Classic Garden, Chicken Caesar, and a new Chicken Apple Pecan.

43:04.480 --> 43:05.520
Those are the three salads.

43:05.520 --> 43:05.840
That sounds good as fuck.

43:05.840 --> 43:08.240
I do want to point out to you guys, just so you all can see-

43:08.240 --> 43:09.440
Yeah, show me a JPEG of these sweet salads.

43:09.440 --> 43:11.920
Let me just give you the one JPEG from this press release.

43:11.920 --> 43:14.320
I do want to point out, I get a big kick out of the fact

43:14.320 --> 43:17.680
that they've depicted these salads with plastic forks

43:17.680 --> 43:19.360
sitting on like a kitchen tray.

43:19.360 --> 43:22.240
Oh, that's great, because sometimes you always think like,

43:22.240 --> 43:24.640
yeah, but it's not really going to look like that when I get it.

43:24.640 --> 43:24.960
Yeah, this is it.

43:24.960 --> 43:26.800
This is all photograph magic.

43:26.800 --> 43:31.360
They kind of shot those salads from the Hubble Space Telescope, just to give you-

43:33.360 --> 43:36.720
Here's a quote from Joe Jordan, chief marketing officer at Domino's.

43:36.720 --> 43:44.400
He quote, now everybody can be happy on pizza night.

43:44.400 --> 43:47.440
There's no shame in wanting salad when everyone else wants pizza,

43:48.000 --> 43:50.560
especially now that Domino's has found a perfect way

43:50.560 --> 43:53.520
to offer even more options for customers across the country.

43:53.520 --> 43:54.880
Yo, dog, a salad.

43:54.880 --> 44:00.080
Hey, dog, that salad, it was the first food people ever ate.

44:00.960 --> 44:01.920
We've done it.

44:01.920 --> 44:02.320
We saw-

44:02.320 --> 44:04.240
Get in here. Get in here. Get in here.

44:04.240 --> 44:04.960
We've done it.

44:04.960 --> 44:07.840
We saw like fucking hippos doing it.

44:07.840 --> 44:09.680
And we were like, let's give that shit a try.

44:09.680 --> 44:10.400
Thanks, hippos.

44:11.200 --> 44:13.360
I just love this mythos that they created.

44:13.360 --> 44:15.040
People are like, hey, you guys want to get pizza?

44:15.040 --> 44:18.320
And there's one guy going, hmm, what is it, damn?

44:18.320 --> 44:19.040
Nothing.

44:19.040 --> 44:22.480
The fucking sad thing about this is, this is 100% on point.

44:22.480 --> 44:24.720
There usually is one person that did not want pizza.

44:24.720 --> 44:26.800
Sure, but then you just, nobody orders pizza.

44:26.800 --> 44:29.760
You don't just go, sorry, Greg, you don't get to eat today.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.680
Do you want a salad?

44:31.680 --> 44:33.040
Those are your two options.

44:33.040 --> 44:36.800
To finish Jordan's quote, the new chicken apple pecan option

44:36.800 --> 44:39.280
may even lure a few pizza lovers over to the salad side.

44:39.840 --> 44:41.280
Are we choosing sides now?

44:41.280 --> 44:43.040
That's a risky business practice.

44:43.040 --> 44:46.800
That's a fucking crazy, if this is what pizza executives think,

44:46.800 --> 44:48.240
that people are like, well, I don't know.

44:48.240 --> 44:49.920
He either eats pizza or a salad.

44:49.920 --> 44:50.400
Yeah.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.720
And then there might be someone who's like, what's that green stuff?

44:52.720 --> 44:54.880
I've been eating pizza discs this whole time.

44:54.880 --> 44:55.920
I didn't know there was greens.

44:55.920 --> 44:56.480
Can I try it?

44:58.720 --> 44:59.920
This is good.

44:59.920 --> 45:03.520
We're thrilled that our salads are now available for Domino's customers

45:03.520 --> 45:05.760
in every store, said Tristan Simpson,

45:05.760 --> 45:08.240
chief marketing officer at Ready Packed Foods.

45:08.240 --> 45:10.240
By the way, these are prepackaged salads.

45:10.240 --> 45:12.000
It literally says that in the press release.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.560
I didn't need to know that, but thank you for your honesty.

45:16.320 --> 45:19.840
Everyone who loves pizza night can now breathe a sigh of relief

45:19.840 --> 45:23.680
and enjoy Domino's classic garden salad with that slice of pizza.

45:23.680 --> 45:29.120
Okay, so Tristan Simpson, Joe Jordan broke down the barrier between pizza and salad.

45:29.120 --> 45:33.120
Pick a side, wield a knife and protect the fucking homeland.

45:33.120 --> 45:34.000
I am a salad.

45:35.360 --> 45:37.360
I have no issue with the idea of like,

45:37.360 --> 45:40.320
hey, with your pizza, you should also get some salad.

45:40.320 --> 45:40.960
Yeah.

45:40.960 --> 45:43.440
I don't know how hard you have to sell that.

45:43.440 --> 45:43.680
Yeah.

45:43.680 --> 45:45.920
Like we offer vegetables now.

45:46.480 --> 45:47.520
Vegetables, huh?

45:47.520 --> 45:48.960
We invented vegetables.

45:48.960 --> 45:49.760
Here's the press release.

45:50.480 --> 45:52.720
Domino's salads are available for $5.99 each.

45:53.360 --> 45:56.720
When you pair them with any one of Domino's mix and match menu items,

45:56.720 --> 45:59.280
which also include medium two topping pizzas.

45:59.280 --> 46:01.680
Hey, thanks for clarifying press release

46:01.680 --> 46:05.440
that I can still secure a medium two topping pizza at Domino's.

46:05.440 --> 46:06.960
I'm glad to hear that menu item is still available.

46:06.960 --> 46:08.000
We're getting out of the pizza business.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.360
Picture this commercial.

46:09.360 --> 46:10.800
Hey, you guys want salad night?

46:10.800 --> 46:11.440
Salad?

46:11.440 --> 46:12.000
Salad?

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
Yeah, but where would we order salad for delivery?

46:16.000 --> 46:16.720
Just a second.

46:17.680 --> 46:18.240
Domino's?

46:19.360 --> 46:21.920
And the answer is actually no, you have to order them with pizza.

46:21.920 --> 46:25.200
We'll also take a pizza, but then you just throw the pizza right in the garbage.

46:25.200 --> 46:27.760
So that's sounding great.

46:27.760 --> 46:28.800
How about a yahoo?

46:28.800 --> 46:29.280
Hit me.

46:30.240 --> 46:32.800
I'm so sorry to just keep doing this to you guys,

46:32.800 --> 46:35.040
but Jack Nicholson or Bruce Willis.

46:36.400 --> 46:37.920
Right, that's top of shit.

46:37.920 --> 46:39.440
This is final Jeopardy time.

46:41.840 --> 46:46.560
Do you remember when fucking A-Kutch took Demi Moore to some event

46:46.560 --> 46:48.560
and B-Willis was like there with him

46:48.560 --> 46:51.920
basically chaperoning his ex-wife's exploits with A plus K?

46:52.960 --> 46:54.320
Just like scoping out his scene.

46:54.320 --> 46:56.080
And do you remember the look on Bruce Willis' face?

46:56.080 --> 46:59.840
And now imagine just a big old wrench

46:59.840 --> 47:02.160
just going in that, just a big old monkey wrench.

47:02.160 --> 47:03.360
This is what I picture.

47:03.360 --> 47:08.080
Just a big old smokey, just flashlight going right in that big old mouth.

47:08.080 --> 47:11.520
You look at Bruce Willis for a long time, like 10, 15 minutes.

47:11.520 --> 47:13.520
And he's just stone face, doesn't move.

47:13.520 --> 47:15.600
And then after 15 minutes, he opens his mouth.

47:15.600 --> 47:20.000
And a fucking fucking genie from Aladdin comes out that mouth.

47:20.000 --> 47:20.880
When did he?

47:20.880 --> 47:23.680
Hold on, I've been looking at him this whole time.

47:23.680 --> 47:24.960
So like, when did he?

47:24.960 --> 47:25.440
What?

47:25.440 --> 47:27.440
Yeah, we can all see Bruno with a big rig.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.680
Yeah, but there's one problem though.

47:29.680 --> 47:33.040
And that's me, Jacko, over here with my rig.

47:35.360 --> 47:37.840
This vape is as good as it gets.

47:37.840 --> 47:39.120
Have you ever danced with the devil?

47:42.240 --> 47:44.480
And you, Jack,

47:49.200 --> 47:51.600
cotton, cotton, cotton, cotton.

47:51.600 --> 47:53.360
Just huge waves of it.

47:53.360 --> 47:55.520
I think I want to jack it up to 20 ohms.

47:55.520 --> 47:57.680
You can't handle 20 ohms.

47:58.800 --> 48:01.760
Only I can with my special illegal celebrity rig.

48:01.760 --> 48:03.280
That's what makes me so fucking.

48:03.280 --> 48:05.280
That's what makes me so fucking angry about all this.

48:05.280 --> 48:08.480
As you know, they're working with illegal underground celebrity rigs.

48:08.480 --> 48:11.280
Okay, I got a hurdle for you, Garth Brooks or Chris Gaines.

48:11.280 --> 48:13.600
Garth Brooks or Chris Gaines, which one rips it?

48:13.600 --> 48:14.480
Which one vapes?

48:14.480 --> 48:15.440
Here's my thing.

48:15.440 --> 48:17.680
I think Chris Gaines vapes too hard and dies.

48:18.800 --> 48:20.080
And that's why we don't get from him.

48:20.080 --> 48:21.920
Here's the interesting thing, Justin.

48:21.920 --> 48:25.120
Garth Brooks only inhales and Chris Gaines only exhales.

48:25.120 --> 48:27.280
If you see him exhaling, he's Chris Gaines.

48:27.280 --> 48:31.600
My dad, our dad interviewed Garth Brooks on Thursday and it is that I,

48:31.600 --> 48:35.520
we fucking begged him to just bring up CG once.

48:35.520 --> 48:36.320
Wouldn't do it.

48:36.320 --> 48:38.400
Just, is Chris there?

48:38.400 --> 48:40.080
Can I speak with Chris?

48:40.080 --> 48:41.760
Can I speak with Chris?

48:41.760 --> 48:44.320
Is Chris inside for me to talk to Garth?

48:44.320 --> 48:45.280
That's a good one.

48:45.280 --> 48:47.360
No, this is Robert Downey Jr. versus Christian Bale.

48:47.360 --> 48:49.200
I don't think either of those boys do it.

48:49.200 --> 48:49.760
I don't think.

48:49.760 --> 48:50.960
Birds do it.

48:50.960 --> 48:52.320
Bees do it.

48:52.320 --> 48:54.320
But RDJ doesn't do it.

48:54.320 --> 48:56.240
I would, I would give you RDJ does not.

48:57.840 --> 48:59.840
Griffin gave me shit earlier this episode.

48:59.840 --> 49:00.480
It was positive.

49:00.480 --> 49:02.640
You didn't hear about staring at my computer.

49:02.640 --> 49:05.280
Now, Griffin's just staring at his computer,

49:05.280 --> 49:07.680
generating random celebrities and asking which one vapes.

49:07.680 --> 49:08.720
It's just fun to think about.

49:08.720 --> 49:10.000
Tyler Perry probably vapes.

49:11.520 --> 49:12.560
Brennan Frazier.

49:12.560 --> 49:16.080
Oh my god.

49:16.080 --> 49:18.400
He's got a full blown bagpipe set up.

49:18.400 --> 49:20.320
Multiple in points.

49:20.320 --> 49:22.880
Multiple juice relays.

49:22.880 --> 49:24.000
Vapesino man.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.840
Do you think Pauly Shore's into vape?

49:25.840 --> 49:26.560
Probably.

49:26.560 --> 49:29.280
Audrey Hepburn would crush a vape.

49:30.160 --> 49:32.240
How about this one from Kiba Davey Morgan Davey.

49:32.240 --> 49:32.720
Thank you.

49:32.720 --> 49:34.480
It's from Yahoo Answers user crazy.

49:34.480 --> 49:39.600
And I just want to, guys, I think it's time that we talk about some nerd stuff for the geek crowd.

49:39.600 --> 49:39.840
Yeah.

49:39.840 --> 49:41.840
Hey, hey, hey, are you nerd boys?

49:42.960 --> 49:43.920
Hey, nerd boys.

49:44.480 --> 49:46.160
Where, where are my geeks at?

49:46.160 --> 49:51.360
Hey, any comic book fans?

49:51.360 --> 49:54.320
Where's my comic, where's my comic fans at?

49:54.320 --> 49:57.920
Hey, we're looking for some listeners that didn't fit in with the jocks.

49:57.920 --> 49:58.480
Here comes one.

49:58.480 --> 50:00.240
It's actually, it's pretty mainstream now, you guys.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.040
It's just, it's for everybody.

50:01.040 --> 50:03.200
Here's one for the comic bookers.

50:03.200 --> 50:04.240
Well, I mean like everybody like.

50:04.240 --> 50:06.480
Here's for, here's one for the dweeboids.

50:06.480 --> 50:08.160
For like everybody, because it's for everybody.

50:08.160 --> 50:11.760
It's from Yahoo Answers user crazy, who asks,

50:11.760 --> 50:19.520
where does Aquaman piss?

50:21.520 --> 50:25.520
Where does Aquaman piss?

50:25.520 --> 50:28.720
I would like, I would like to make for you a scenario.

50:28.720 --> 50:29.920
You're laying on the beach.

50:29.920 --> 50:30.320
Yeah.

50:30.320 --> 50:34.000
You just enjoy, maybe this is your week, your first weekend off all summer.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.160
And you're like, we're taking the kids to the beach.

50:36.160 --> 50:39.360
Aquaman walks up on the beach and you're like, honey, it's Aquaman.

50:39.360 --> 50:44.560
And he just whips his dong out, and then he gets back into the water.

50:44.560 --> 50:48.320
If you say Aquaman just pisses wherever in the ocean, it's not a big deal.

50:48.320 --> 50:53.440
That would be tantamount to me, just like pulling down now, the only, just the underwear,

50:53.440 --> 50:55.200
which is the only thing I'm wearing right now.

50:55.200 --> 50:56.800
The only thing keeping brothers apart.

50:56.800 --> 51:01.120
And just sort of blasting one up into the sky where we live in this house.

51:01.120 --> 51:03.760
No, that is not where Aquaman do it.

51:03.760 --> 51:05.280
That is not where Aquaman do it.

51:05.280 --> 51:07.920
Do you think he's designated a corner of the ocean?

51:07.920 --> 51:11.440
Designated a corner of the ocean where all the fish are allowed to go?

51:11.440 --> 51:14.080
Or he's just like, all this, this is our house.

51:14.080 --> 51:15.440
So this is the bathroom of the house.

51:15.440 --> 51:16.720
He probably is a gentleman.

51:16.720 --> 51:19.920
He probably gets to the Arctic Ocean because like, nobody's getting in there.

51:19.920 --> 51:20.960
Oh, but it's so cold.

51:20.960 --> 51:22.320
I think I have an answer.

51:22.320 --> 51:25.440
Okay, here comes Justin's scientific explanation.

51:25.440 --> 51:27.600
Where do Aquaman do that dirty thing?

51:27.600 --> 51:29.840
He gets his, he gets his zippoc baggy.

51:29.840 --> 51:30.240
Okay.

51:30.240 --> 51:33.040
Then he goes to the surface and he fills it with air.

51:33.680 --> 51:36.160
And then he goes back down to the bottom of the ocean.

51:36.160 --> 51:40.000
Oh, like in a water world.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.680
So he goes up on the ocean.

51:41.680 --> 51:44.720
He pisses into this bag that is also full of air, right?

51:44.720 --> 51:47.600
So he's displacing air and filling it with piss, right?

51:48.240 --> 51:48.880
And then he seals it up.

51:48.880 --> 51:50.000
This checks out so far.

51:50.000 --> 51:50.800
So far so good.

51:50.800 --> 51:53.840
He seals it up real quick and then he just lets it go.

51:53.840 --> 51:56.480
And because it's mainly filled with air, he floats up to the surface.

51:56.480 --> 51:57.200
And that's flushing.

51:57.200 --> 51:58.240
He calls it wishes.

51:58.240 --> 52:00.080
Those are wishes that he's sending out.

52:00.080 --> 52:01.280
And that's where jellyfish come from.

52:01.280 --> 52:02.560
That's where jellyfish come from.

52:02.560 --> 52:06.560
Their backs are pissed at Aquaman but go to the surface.

52:06.560 --> 52:07.680
Where does he do it though?

52:07.680 --> 52:10.720
He probably gets out of the ocean and goes to earth toilet.

52:10.720 --> 52:11.360
What's Aquaman?

52:11.360 --> 52:13.040
Hey, can I tell you guys something?

52:13.040 --> 52:17.200
I like to consider myself, you know, one of the, like a nerd.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.760
I don't know nothing about Aquaman.

52:19.760 --> 52:20.960
I don't know anything about Aquaman.

52:20.960 --> 52:21.840
I know he talks to fish.

52:21.840 --> 52:22.640
He lives in the ocean.

52:22.640 --> 52:23.840
He loves Aqua.

52:23.840 --> 52:27.360
But he probably, is he from earth first and he fell in the ocean one day

52:27.360 --> 52:29.680
and just some whales were like, you're ours now.

52:29.680 --> 52:33.200
Because if that's the case, then he probably knows about toilets and what's up with them.

52:33.200 --> 52:35.680
But if he was born in the ocean, he's lived there his whole life.

52:36.640 --> 52:40.080
Where do Ariel, where does Ariel and all the mermaids piss?

52:40.080 --> 52:41.200
Where do fish piss?

52:41.200 --> 52:44.240
Like Ariel doesn't, Ariel doesn't piss.

52:44.240 --> 52:45.040
Fish piss through their skin.

52:45.040 --> 52:45.680
King Triton.

52:46.400 --> 52:48.080
King Triton pisses for sure.

52:48.880 --> 52:50.560
You think King Triton pisses?

52:50.560 --> 52:53.360
I love that, listen, I don't want to get blue.

52:53.360 --> 52:56.400
But I love that this question has her super worried about number one.

52:56.400 --> 53:02.160
I'm way more worried about the twosies are a doozy.

53:02.160 --> 53:04.240
I'm pretty sure that Aquaman can't shit.

53:06.640 --> 53:07.280
What's he eat?

53:07.280 --> 53:07.760
Krill?

53:07.760 --> 53:09.200
Probably not even krill, right?

53:09.200 --> 53:10.480
Is he a filter feeder?

53:10.480 --> 53:13.040
Aquaman just slims with his mouth open.

53:15.440 --> 53:16.800
Hey guys, fuck it.

53:16.800 --> 53:18.480
Where does Spider-Man piss?

53:18.480 --> 53:22.000
We don't, I don't think, have you guys ever, I've read a few comic books in my day.

53:22.000 --> 53:29.120
I've never seen a panel etched by Jack Kirby who's like, and now, of course, it's been a while.

53:29.120 --> 53:31.120
Spider-Man's been doing a lot of adventures.

53:31.120 --> 53:36.160
He just fought off the rhino and we had a lot of fun here, but it's been a long time.

53:36.160 --> 53:38.480
So yeah, Spider-Man's got to go piss now.

53:38.480 --> 53:46.000
What if every 20 issues of Superman, on the 20th one, it's just like 30 frames of him going,

53:46.000 --> 53:51.440
ahhh, someone's in, someone's in, hurry.

53:51.440 --> 53:52.960
I don't hear anybody.

53:52.960 --> 53:53.520
Come on now.

53:54.560 --> 53:55.520
Who's moving me up?

53:56.400 --> 53:58.480
No, there's no way that Superman can push it.

53:58.480 --> 54:00.240
There was never a bathroom scene in 24.

54:01.360 --> 54:02.880
Was there ever a bathroom scene in the movie?

54:02.880 --> 54:03.840
It's too busy.

54:03.840 --> 54:05.920
Sometimes you get really busy and it just, like,

54:05.920 --> 54:08.320
reabsorbs back into your organs and muscles and stuff.

54:09.680 --> 54:10.720
That can happen sometimes.

54:10.720 --> 54:15.960
I feel like what if there was what if there's an episode of 24 where you had diarrhea all day

54:16.600 --> 54:21.640
What if they're what if I had an episode 24 from the last time we recorded the podcast my brother my brother and me

54:21.880 --> 54:26.280
Just all diarrhea the whole time and I I wouldn't be a featured player in that season

54:26.280 --> 54:31.220
I don't certainly not I would definitely during the countdown sequences where they would cut back from commercial. I'd be in a corner. Just like

54:31.220 --> 54:38.460
I would love it. There was just constant shots of Jack trying to call Griffin and the phone buzzing just like a city

54:41.780 --> 54:43.780
Screaming like

54:48.140 --> 54:51.140
Where does Aquaman do that, but listen guys listen

54:53.820 --> 54:56.340
Does he pissed do you think he has like a coral toilet

54:56.340 --> 54:59.660
Do you think that he has a toilet that was like in a down submarine or something?

54:59.660 --> 55:02.320
He was like, thank God. Oh, that's probably it

55:03.660 --> 55:09.180
Probably an old you boat and he runs and he sees a bunch of Nazi skeletons. He's like suckers

55:09.180 --> 55:11.660
I've got to use the gotta use the John

55:12.260 --> 55:17.100
This is Jack Cousteau. I have found my greatest discovery ever

55:17.100 --> 55:23.100
Um, I actually think I've gone too deep on this one. This is a I found a sub filled with bits

55:23.100 --> 55:27.980
I don't know where to start. I don't know where to start with this one guys. Usually the ocean is a bountiful

55:27.980 --> 55:29.420
bountiful

55:29.420 --> 55:36.180
There's a mystery. There's a mystery. There's piss. This is something with piss. I'm pretty sure Aquaman did it but he's crazy

55:36.180 --> 55:41.340
Well, I retire. Well, this is it for me. This is it. This is that I am breaking up with the ocean

55:42.340 --> 55:48.620
Next up we're checking out Jack Cousteau's fields. I just go to fields and see what's going on

55:48.620 --> 55:56.140
Uh, should we wrap up you think yes. Yes. I'm gonna try I'm trying to get it. Fuck

55:58.780 --> 56:01.020
Find a good one and it's a good one Justin

56:01.660 --> 56:07.120
Griffin I think everybody's pretty tired of this game. Oh, are they I think this is the best fucking game like ever

56:07.120 --> 56:12.260
We've played some fun games here. This has been the first interactive episode of my bim-bam because you could get a high score on this episode

56:12.260 --> 56:13.520
Okay

56:13.520 --> 56:15.420
Martin Sheen

56:15.420 --> 56:19.880
President Josiah Bartlett from the West Wing or Tommy Lee Jones

56:22.300 --> 56:24.300
Shit

56:27.420 --> 56:29.420
Martin Sheen seems like kind of a hippie

56:29.660 --> 56:30.180
Yeah

56:30.180 --> 56:33.900
But let me paint you a picture Justin imagine this scene in the tooth

56:34.180 --> 56:39.380
Cathedrals is I think the episode and rather than just lighten up a cigarette in the middle of the church

56:39.380 --> 56:46.780
He just pulls out a sweet-ass steampunk themed vape rig. He snaps his rig over his knee and throws it on the presidential seal

56:46.780 --> 56:48.780
Are you happy God?

56:50.220 --> 56:51.900
God

56:51.900 --> 56:55.460
That's how I quit vaping was cursing God's name at a funeral

56:57.420 --> 57:02.500
Just so you know for the future yeah boy crime, I don't know is where

57:02.500 --> 57:07.620
I decided to kick your ass

57:11.580 --> 57:13.580
Waves of cotton

57:14.100 --> 57:20.900
Dolores Lanningham died in a car crash because their whole cab was filled with cotton. I learned it from watching you

57:21.500 --> 57:25.860
Well, mr. President one thing you could do to help you relieve your stress

57:26.860 --> 57:30.380
Cut some huge cotton sheets from that mouth of yours

57:30.380 --> 57:32.380
That's one thing

57:35.900 --> 57:37.900
I'm never so is this

57:38.180 --> 57:43.860
Here something said as Dolores Lanningham Toby. I need you to buy me a new vape rig here you go mr. President

57:43.860 --> 57:48.020
I found one good. I want you to take my old vape rig. It's been passed down from my family

57:48.740 --> 57:50.820
Daniel Boone first made this vape rig

57:53.060 --> 57:55.860
Out of a dog's bone and now it's yours

57:55.860 --> 57:59.020
Cotton cotton cotton treasure it

58:02.580 --> 58:04.580
Jed what are you thinking about?

58:05.700 --> 58:12.500
Cotton that's the last word in the series. You remember that fucking touched me. God. I love West Wing. Yeah, it's a good show

58:13.380 --> 58:15.380
This has been my brother my brother of me

58:55.780 --> 59:00.460
Called the dead pilot society and it's spearheaded by Andrew Reich and Ben Blacker

59:00.460 --> 59:03.540

Seriously, thank you all for sticking with us. I I know this has been

59:37.340 --> 59:43.100
Maybe an exhausting one to listen to we're working really hard to try and make a good television show for you

59:43.100 --> 59:46.940
And I'm really really excited about what we've made and I don't want to make it sound like we're not having a good time

59:46.940 --> 59:51.660
Making the TV show we're having an excellent excellent time, but it is fucking so much work. It is a lot

59:51.660 --> 59:57.400
It's it's tough. Um, and we're gonna keep the podcast going though and keep it coming out for you

59:58.060 --> 01:00:02.280
Again, this is probably out late and I apologize for that the last one came out. I think a day late

So we'll try and get this one up on time. And yeah, thank you all so much Griffin. Do you have one more question for us?
