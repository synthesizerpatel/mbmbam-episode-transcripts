00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better it's better

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.300 --> 01:02.300
Better it's better

01:10.820 --> 01:12.820
Hello thanks for having me a

01:12.820 --> 01:16.860
Great sir solid

01:21.700 --> 01:27.100
To what is sure to be extremely chaotic my brother my brother me. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:27.100 --> 01:30.860
I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy, and I'm the other brother Jean

01:31.360 --> 01:36.980
Hi, Jean. Hi. Hi, Jean. Welcome. Everybody. This is this is our friend Jean gray

01:36.980 --> 01:43.780
You may know her from God. What what what Jean things things? Yeah, I'm so excited to be here

01:43.780 --> 01:48.200
And that you finally decided to let the show be my brother my brother and Jean

01:48.740 --> 01:52.860
My brother and Jean actually sounds better now. Yeah, we've been dancing around it for a long time

01:52.860 --> 01:59.340
I'm actually a little stressed out if I could say because you're one of the few people who I think actually gives good advice

01:59.660 --> 02:03.380
Yeah, I'm worried about that kind of standard of quality

02:03.380 --> 02:09.620
Coming to coming to our program. Oh, well, don't worry about that. It's really gone downhill since the pandemic

02:12.940 --> 02:14.860
Nothing to worry about there

02:14.860 --> 02:20.320
I'm I'm worried because I'm Jean you are smarter than everyone. I know put together

02:21.380 --> 02:28.700
And I planned a lot of me though. Come on. No, I said what I said, I got a 1280 on the SAT

02:28.700 --> 02:30.700
Come on, man. I got a 1400

02:30.700 --> 02:35.040
What why have we never talked about this now? I know why oh, I didn't take my SATs

02:38.740 --> 02:44.100
No, I'm not doing that and they were like you can't get into NYU unless you take these SATs and I was like

02:44.100 --> 02:46.200
I'm gonna get into NYU. Anyway, I did

02:47.140 --> 02:51.540
See so cool Jean. Damn it. Yeah. I also just want to say before anybody

02:52.500 --> 02:58.420
Access as the kids say this is before they changed like the number of the highest you could get on that

02:58.420 --> 03:02.340
So 1400 used to be good. No, what used to be good thing? I

03:03.300 --> 03:05.960
Don't know. They had like another 800 points in there somewhere

03:07.300 --> 03:14.260
I think just for putting your name on emotional intelligence. Yeah, it's just like yeah, how good of a friend are you?

03:14.260 --> 03:20.580
How caring are you? Are you open to new experiences? Yeah stuff like that. Yeah, you just do tick-tock dances and they score you

03:20.580 --> 03:22.340
I'm gonna take it now

03:22.340 --> 03:27.260
Can you do like yeah SATs? Can you like retro? I'm sure you can't they'll take your money

03:27.260 --> 03:32.700
You should be allowed to be like I'm here for an adult as I'm an adult. I've changed my mind

03:32.700 --> 03:36.760
I just want to put it on Facebook what my score is and I'm ready

03:37.020 --> 03:42.460
Once you're once you're over 25, you should be able to rent a car and take the SAT

03:42.460 --> 03:49.060
But be able to write on different questions like not applicable. Yeah, not I would never you I'm 25

03:49.060 --> 03:55.660
I haven't also am I allowed to smoke during the SATs? I am it's the adult SATs. I can smoke

03:55.660 --> 04:00.620
I think you should be able to put on Game of Thrones drink have a little like sippy cup of wine

04:01.420 --> 04:03.380
Have an ashtray

04:03.380 --> 04:06.900
Have some in case you need to cry take a break and watch something

04:08.340 --> 04:09.860
Yeah

04:09.860 --> 04:11.340
renew

04:11.340 --> 04:15.900
So this is an advice show obviously take obviously we're gonna take people's

04:17.100 --> 04:23.140
Questions and turn them out. We like into wisdom with with Jean's help. Our brother Griffin is still

04:23.140 --> 04:25.140
I don't know man, I guess

04:26.060 --> 04:30.660
Recuperating from having a baby. I don't know that he did that much. Well, he pushed a baby out of his body

04:30.860 --> 04:33.580
Yeah, I pushed a baby out. Wow, which part?

04:34.380 --> 04:37.220
Yeah, well, that's what we're still trying to determine Jean

04:37.220 --> 04:41.300
We have our best people on this and we're just basing this on his sort of like attitude and work ethic

04:41.300 --> 04:43.140
It just seems like he took it really well

04:43.140 --> 04:48.900
I'm saying that like depending on which part I'd be like, I understand like if it's his but I'm like

04:48.900 --> 04:51.820
You definitely need a break but like come back to work

04:51.820 --> 04:59.220
But if it's like his p-hole, then he should be out for three years. Yeah, that's that's probably true. No, we're very sympathetic

05:00.940 --> 05:02.060
Congratulations

05:02.060 --> 05:07.380
Yeah, congratulations Griffin would love to talk to you or see you again if you get this message

05:08.020 --> 05:11.820
Love for you to dip back in and put down the piÃ±a colada and come back

05:13.180 --> 05:15.180
The beach

05:15.740 --> 05:17.300
Okay

05:17.300 --> 05:19.300
Well, I want to get started

05:19.300 --> 05:25.020
Jean I have a special segment here and it's called riddle me piss. Oh, no. Yeah now Jean

05:25.020 --> 05:27.020
This is our guest

05:27.740 --> 05:30.220
This is our guest Jean now I've got some riddles here

05:30.980 --> 05:32.860
These are a little bit shorter

05:32.860 --> 05:35.340
Faster riddles than we normally do these are sent by hazel

05:35.740 --> 05:41.780
These are from of course the service riddles calm and Jean, you know, just do your best. Like I said, you're very smart

05:41.780 --> 05:46.540
So I'm sure you'll get these Jean the thing with these that Travis finds is that they're

05:46.540 --> 05:53.860
Extremely bad riddles that no one would have ever gotten. So please don't well, I don't know. Well listen to this first one though

05:54.660 --> 05:56.580
What's my motivation?

05:56.580 --> 06:01.340
Like do I get to cross a bridge or something? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, if you answer all five of these

06:02.140 --> 06:03.980
You can cross a bridge

06:03.980 --> 06:09.540
Extremely powerful. Yeah, you get a powerful crystal that will grant you two extra life. Hmm

06:09.540 --> 06:17.420
Two this first one what crawls and is yellow and black and doesn't fly and there's the ones obvious, I think oh

06:18.820 --> 06:21.700
It's it's a bee with a back injury. Oh

06:22.700 --> 06:24.700
very close Justin a

06:27.660 --> 06:29.660
Yellow and black caterpillar

06:29.740 --> 06:35.060
I guess that's close to what crossing is yellow and black. It doesn't fly. Why a bee spider, of course

06:35.060 --> 06:37.740
I was also gonna say Morgan Beeman. Oh

06:37.740 --> 06:39.740
Oh, okay

06:41.020 --> 06:43.020
He used to fly

06:44.740 --> 06:49.780
This one I just like the core concept of a guy works at the poison factory

06:51.260 --> 06:53.260
Poison like Bellevue DeVoe

06:53.580 --> 06:54.580
Yeah

06:54.580 --> 07:00.900
Where they just met at the BBD factory. Yeah demand for Bellevue DeVoe's poison is off the charts folks

07:00.900 --> 07:06.060
We got a print these these kasingles vinyl is back vinyls back. We got vinyl and kasingles

07:06.060 --> 07:08.060
of Bellevue DeVoe's poison

07:09.620 --> 07:13.460
Man, I hope whoever came up with the word kasingles was very proud of themselves

07:17.660 --> 07:22.260
He goes home from work and his wife tells him to wash his hands before eating so he doesn't die

07:22.580 --> 07:27.100
So he goes washes his hand and the next day he's found dead. How is that possible?

07:27.100 --> 07:29.100
Um

07:35.660 --> 07:37.660
It's endless

07:39.500 --> 07:43.220
I'll just go ahead and tell you cuz I want to discuss it when he went to wash his hands

07:43.220 --> 07:47.820
He opened the tap. So the poison went on the tap and when he closed the tap, he touched the poison again now

07:47.820 --> 07:51.260
I think I like about that he works in the poison factory

07:53.420 --> 07:59.580
He worked in the poison factory and what this what this riddle presupposes is that he was just in there in

07:59.860 --> 08:05.220
The poison with his hands that he was just working the poison with his bare no safety

08:05.220 --> 08:09.040
But it doesn't get anywhere else. I guess drive home, you know

08:09.040 --> 08:14.420
I think I get yeah, this is all I can think is that this is like Victorian London

08:14.420 --> 08:16.420
Um

08:17.060 --> 08:24.220
There have to be procedures for you to like scrub out you would think you would think what is correct but it's always wrong

08:34.380 --> 08:39.540
Yeah, and this one people at home are screaming the answer to this well we can't really it's that obvious

08:39.540 --> 08:46.540
It's so obvious. The answer is a bee because it always stings but also helps. It's Morgan Beeman again

08:46.540 --> 08:51.820
It's Morgan Beeman again. I was also gonna say that he might have stung the guy from the poison

08:52.100 --> 08:54.100
He might have stung. They're all

08:55.900 --> 08:57.900
Okay, so what is babble

08:58.660 --> 09:02.420
Storylines interweaving one more so dot-dot-dot

09:03.100 --> 09:07.500
There was this one time you were thirsty and decided to boil water, right?

09:07.500 --> 09:13.700
Just go with it. All you had left were one thin wine glass and one thick glass

09:14.020 --> 09:19.380
Which is more likely to break love a thick glass a thick do you have a thick glass?

09:19.380 --> 09:25.700
We I took a long time selecting our the glasses for this house because I didn't want them to be too thin or too thick

09:25.700 --> 09:32.540
Yeah, I want a nice heavy glass. Do you know what I did? I now that I'm 40 I have completely

09:32.540 --> 09:37.580
This is kind of embarrassing to admit, but I'm just gonna go I have almost completely

09:38.660 --> 09:40.060
eliminated glass

09:40.060 --> 09:48.020
Where from my we have a three-year-old and a six-year-old and enemy and I just don't want anything glass anymore

09:48.420 --> 09:53.980
Everything's like yeah recycle plastic. I don't I'm just out of the game. I'm out of the glass game

09:53.980 --> 09:57.560
I can't handle the pressure. I set glasses down too hard and break them

09:57.560 --> 10:02.940
I and we referred to mostly everything I do is shrekking around just shrekking around

10:02.940 --> 10:09.020
I'm just out there shrekking around breaking glasses left and right. I don't need that. It was probably your thing glasses. So I

10:09.700 --> 10:14.560
Mean, wait what I just why was I boiling the water or what?

10:14.820 --> 10:18.860
So there was this one time you were thirsty and decided to boil water, right?

10:18.860 --> 10:22.500
And then it says in parentheses just go with it in parentheses

10:22.500 --> 10:30.700
Yeah, just hot or do I wait for it to call you had left I'm telling you all the details I have

10:34.780 --> 10:41.580
You decided to boil water right just go with it all you have left for one thin wine glass and one thick glass

10:41.580 --> 10:43.580
which is more likely to break the

10:45.300 --> 10:49.980
Glass but the answer is uh, why would you be boiling water to drink in the first place?

10:49.980 --> 10:52.980
But I but are you fucking kidding me?

10:53.140 --> 10:59.020
That is the answer that is the answer but what if you're in like what if you're on naked and afraid, uh-huh?

10:59.020 --> 11:05.960
That's a good point. They told Travis this naked and afraid and two glasses. This is actually the most irritating one

11:06.500 --> 11:08.700
Gene this is not Travis is not making these up

11:08.740 --> 11:15.740
There's someone who like wrote that into the website and they're like wrote it into the world. Yeah fucking good riddle

11:15.740 --> 11:20.700
Riddle good riddle. Why would you write that and send it? What's your answer?

11:21.420 --> 11:27.460
Yeah, I am so fucking furious the answer right at the answer. Let me talk try slowly talk

11:27.460 --> 11:32.200
Yeah, I'm furious. Okay, because at the one point where it's like

11:32.880 --> 11:39.420
You might stop to think this is weird. Maybe this is part of the riddle. They literally said just go

11:39.420 --> 11:45.340
with it like they did you that's cheating to the worst to the great

11:45.340 --> 11:51.700
It's like you lit it can't get more unfair and they were like don't ask the answer and they also don't give the I mean

11:51.700 --> 11:54.580
The the answer isn't but the question isn't

11:55.260 --> 12:00.100
Do you drink the water? It's which is more likely to break has nothing to do with the fact that you're boiling water

12:00.420 --> 12:06.300
This is the one I love it so much. There should be more there should be more like this. Don't look at him

12:06.300 --> 12:12.460
Uh, yeah, don't send any more of those in. It's obvious. Thank you. Hazel Hazel sent those. Thank you. Thanks Hazel

12:12.500 --> 12:14.500
Okay, then we're gonna help actual people. Here we go

12:14.540 --> 12:20.380
I've started trading voice messages with a pen pal during quarantine and it's been really fun and exciting. Oh good

12:20.380 --> 12:25.380
She's French, but speaks excellent English. So we've been communicating via English so far

12:25.380 --> 12:31.580
But I have secretly been learning French through an app so that I could speak with her in her native language

12:31.580 --> 12:37.100
Well, I started my last message off with 30 seconds worth of what I thought was decent French

12:38.060 --> 12:41.020
But her response didn't mention it at all

12:42.060 --> 12:44.060
What the fuck do I do?

12:46.100 --> 12:48.100
Or should I never mention it or

12:51.660 --> 12:53.660
French fool god

12:57.580 --> 12:59.660
It's a difficult pill. Yeah

12:59.660 --> 13:01.540
I

13:01.540 --> 13:03.540
I'm very confrontational

13:04.100 --> 13:05.980
so

13:05.980 --> 13:12.740
This one is difficult for me because my next message would have been like in French being like, did you hear my fucking French?

13:15.220 --> 13:16.980
What's up

13:16.980 --> 13:23.100
Yeah, yeah, did you fool a fool my you know, the whole thing. Did you get it bitch like what happened?

13:25.620 --> 13:26.980
What's up

13:26.980 --> 13:30.420
Is it possible that like I'm not bilingual

13:30.740 --> 13:36.260
I speak a little Spanish like enough to get around right but like my brain still has to do the computations

13:36.940 --> 13:41.380
It's not happening. Like second nature. Is it possible your French was so good

13:41.940 --> 13:43.940
That it just didn't trigger

13:44.100 --> 13:50.060
Like they just kind of like processed it right? Like I don't know. I'm used to hearing both of these. It's not gonna like

13:50.060 --> 13:56.700
Mess me up. Like if you if you hang out with people who are bilingual, especially like two people who speak a different language from you

13:56.700 --> 13:59.460
you'll notice in conversation sometimes they'll just start like

14:00.180 --> 14:06.480
You know, they'll switch without even really thinking about it. Maybe your French was so good that they didn't even really process

14:06.480 --> 14:08.480
I watch a lot of polyglots

14:09.100 --> 14:11.100
Trying to surprise people

14:12.020 --> 14:17.100
With their own languages videos on YouTube. That's my weird hobby

14:17.100 --> 14:23.740
And that happens that people are like immediately like oh, okay, and then just continue with the conversation

14:23.940 --> 14:31.480
So, uh, that's possible. I said like when people are at like a like when the you watch the videos of like

14:32.020 --> 14:34.020
an American going into like

14:35.380 --> 14:37.520
Chinese restaurant or something and then they're just like

14:38.820 --> 14:42.300
Like let me blow you away with the fact that I also know your language

14:42.300 --> 14:48.740
Statistically speaking, isn't it strange that there's no video of someone walking up to someone to do street magic

14:48.740 --> 14:53.440
But then the person that they approach is also a street magician who does street magic back to them

14:56.700 --> 15:03.220
That should exist right that has to have happened right but that's like it's not gonna mix, you know

15:03.220 --> 15:05.960
I just not gonna be impressed what I would be

15:06.180 --> 15:10.100
Going and they keep doing street magic back and forth between until they die. Yeah

15:10.100 --> 15:16.860
Until they die and eventually they're like we should buy some tigers together. Absolutely. We should let's take this show on the road

15:17.020 --> 15:20.580
This is I enjoy France very much. I

15:22.060 --> 15:24.060
Especially because they call me John

15:28.580 --> 15:31.540
And so when I was in France a lot of my

15:32.500 --> 15:35.820
My way of communicating I was like, I'm never gonna be good enough right now

15:35.820 --> 15:41.580
So let me just choose things that I know are are funny like the monkey smoke in the pipe

15:44.420 --> 15:46.820
And I'd say a lot of things about bicyclette

15:47.580 --> 15:53.480
And if I was charming enough, then they were fine with it. They were like, oh, oh stupid. I'm a con

15:54.860 --> 15:56.860
French is hard and

15:57.100 --> 16:03.380
yeah, no, it's I tried to learn it during the last year because why not and

16:03.380 --> 16:06.700
They have if I'm not mistaken

16:07.300 --> 16:10.740
20 words, but those 20 words each have

16:11.620 --> 16:16.020
1,000,000 different uses and so like voo could be

16:16.900 --> 16:22.020
Anything don't complain about a language that is unless you're like mainly complaining about English

16:22.500 --> 16:27.700
No, English is the worst English is the worst because none of what we say actually means

16:27.700 --> 16:33.460
I've tried talking to a four-year-old and you use like a turn of phrase and the four-year-olds like what the fuck?

16:33.740 --> 16:38.220
What does that mean and you're like, uh, don't worry about it. It's dumb. Don't worry about it

16:38.220 --> 16:41.260
What did you want the person to say? It's like what?

16:42.140 --> 16:49.800
Yeah, right like that's what you're hoping for. Like you're telling me you learned French in addition to English a feat

16:49.800 --> 16:51.800
Which I demonstrated

16:51.800 --> 16:57.920
I think you just nailed it right there. I think it's like, oh, okay

16:57.920 --> 17:05.400
So you decided to do the thing that I'm already doing. I'm not impressed. I'm already doing that thing and I think

17:07.240 --> 17:14.480
Mainly a lot of Americans are like look at the light and everybody's like, yeah, we all speak like 80 languages like okay

17:14.480 --> 17:16.480
So great good for you

17:16.480 --> 17:22.400
Um, yeah, we already do and also if you didn't contextualize it it probably seemed kind of weird

17:22.640 --> 17:27.840
Like have you been catfishing this whole time and you spoke French this whole time?

17:27.840 --> 17:33.300
Wait, if you had started speaking Esperanto, I bet they would have mentioned that right that would have been like, whoa

17:33.440 --> 17:35.800
What was that? I didn't understand what you just said

17:35.800 --> 17:42.360
Can you back up only 2% of the population understood what you just said if that I mean keep speaking French

17:42.360 --> 17:48.280
That's uh, it's it's a great it's a great language to learn and to know but definitely like yeah, just ask

17:48.720 --> 17:50.720
Just ask and it is the best way to

17:51.480 --> 17:55.760
Do it because you want to do it and not to impress somebody and I'm sure they'll help you

17:55.760 --> 17:57.760
That would be nice to have somebody to

17:58.320 --> 18:01.840
Communicate a language you're trying to learn. That's the best way to learn. Yeah, right

18:01.840 --> 18:05.160
It's the best way to practice maybe record some messages of yourself like

18:05.560 --> 18:11.320
Congratulating yourself after you learn the French and then play it back for yourself so you can get the validation. There you go

18:11.320 --> 18:18.060
But like draw a fake mustache on and some cool sunglasses. Yeah alter ego complimentary Tony

18:20.480 --> 18:25.280
Yeah, just there to bully your spirits make you feel that was a real good French you did son

18:25.280 --> 18:28.840
I'm proud of you. Did you call me son? Yeah, I'm also your dad. I

18:29.600 --> 18:33.760
Could tell you've been needing this you earned my respect for the first time finally

18:33.760 --> 18:39.180
I respect your son and I was wrong to change the channel so I could watch Mythbusters. You were right

18:39.180 --> 18:41.180
it

18:41.260 --> 18:43.820
Wasn't your fault that your mom and I separated

18:46.300 --> 18:51.980
At the time it was your school, but no it's all on me I wasn't there for I was speaking in anger son

18:51.980 --> 18:55.700
It's something I learned from my dad, and I'm so glad you didn't learn for me

18:55.700 --> 18:59.900
I like that you're sensitive meet your new mother you guys are the same age to get along great

19:01.620 --> 19:07.340
I just want to let you know you're trape in my book in my book. You're always trape in

19:07.340 --> 19:12.980
I so I want to try out something new here to replace Yahoo. This is sent in this was a suggestion

19:12.980 --> 19:17.300
Did you know the Yahoo answer service died it? Yeah? Well, it's not your empire

19:17.300 --> 19:20.260
I built an empire at it is dying in front of us. You can no longer

19:21.060 --> 19:25.900
Put new questions on it is not they've not pulled the book. Yeah, you can't answer that. It's read-only

19:26.620 --> 19:29.260
It's everyone can stop by and say their last goodbyes

19:29.260 --> 19:36.700
Um yeah, so what Sarah said phase of its of its lifespan so sack exchange calm has a

19:37.620 --> 19:39.940
part of its website for life hacks

19:40.380 --> 19:45.540
But it's life hack requests or someone is saying do you have a life hack for this?

19:46.340 --> 19:50.380
So thank you for sending this in Michael this request for a life hack

19:51.020 --> 19:53.020
was was asked

19:53.140 --> 19:57.780
How to properly eat crumbly food with your hand?

19:57.780 --> 19:59.020
I'm

19:59.020 --> 20:04.820
Talking about grated cheese the crumbs at the bottom of a pack of chips you get the idea

20:05.420 --> 20:11.380
Basically anything that gets stuck on your fingers and or falls to the ground when you try to put it in your hand

20:11.540 --> 20:13.860
Into your mouth is there a nice trick

20:14.380 --> 20:21.580
Preferably without tools to get this kind of stuff inside your mouth without making a mess that was asked by max D

20:22.380 --> 20:24.440
Yeah, you tip the bag

20:24.440 --> 20:27.000
into your mouth it's

20:28.840 --> 20:32.440
Funny you should mention that Jean because the first answer

20:32.800 --> 20:38.880
For the crumbs at the bottom of a bag of chips hold the bag with the opening on top make it almost flat and slowly

20:39.040 --> 20:43.940
Rotated about 45 degrees while shaking it a little bit so that the crumbs end up in a corner

20:44.560 --> 20:49.840
Continue to rotate and shake it while forming a small lip which easily fits into your mouth

20:49.840 --> 20:56.360
Once the bag is rotated slightly more than 90 degrees. The crumbs will start to roll into your mouth. No tools needed

20:56.360 --> 21:02.600
I guess this works less well for grated cheese since they tend to stick more. Maybe you have to shake a bit harder

21:02.600 --> 21:04.480
They get a tap

21:04.480 --> 21:06.400
slow tap a

21:06.400 --> 21:13.560
Slow tap, you know, it's it's a one of the few times when I really feel alive is when I'm doing this with a noose

21:14.320 --> 21:19.080
At the bottom. There's a lot of like different leaf and so yeah, I don't know I have

21:19.080 --> 21:27.240
No idea. What kind of speed or texture. I'm about to experience like I could get like a full

21:27.760 --> 21:32.920
Fun dip mouthful of like just salt and pepper. Oh, yeah. Yeah, and ruin my whole day

21:32.920 --> 21:37.700
I don't know but that you know what? I don't even stop to think about it. That's how alive I am

21:37.700 --> 21:40.600
Yeah, and vibrant in the moment even at 40

21:40.600 --> 21:44.780
That's how I feel with like when you when you're down to the crumbs of a pretzel bag and you know

21:44.780 --> 21:50.620
You know, it's straight salt, but I still can't stop myself from doing it to feel alive

21:50.620 --> 21:51.420
You know what? I mean?

21:51.420 --> 21:56.660
Like I feel like Bodhi jumping out of the airplane, right and I know Johnny Utah's chasing me

21:56.660 --> 21:59.940
But I can't stop myself from doing it Justin. I

22:00.740 --> 22:03.140
Don't really get these. I didn't understand any of that

22:04.140 --> 22:06.140
What it's a point break. Oh

22:07.260 --> 22:08.540
Christ

22:08.540 --> 22:12.060
Point break. It's a great movie. You guys should see it. Oh, I have seen it

22:12.060 --> 22:16.900
I've seen it many times and I remembered nothing all the musical. Oh, the musical is good. Yeah

22:18.340 --> 22:21.380
Now sometimes okay. Now the only time I've gotten into trouble is this

22:23.740 --> 22:30.600
Sometimes you do the tip up and you realize that in the opening of the bag initially you've left a small sort of

22:31.300 --> 22:37.460
Blockade in the corner. So what you've done is you've created a sort of stoppage where the salt and flavor

22:37.460 --> 22:42.260
Is that right? Oh you try and then you're then it's like, okay

22:42.260 --> 22:47.580
Now we're in a real dire situation because I'm gonna try to open this up a little bit, but that's real danger

22:47.580 --> 22:49.580
like you could be throwing a

22:49.780 --> 22:52.140
flavor all over the place at that point now I

22:53.020 --> 22:58.500
What about an extra long one of those like candy sticks that comes with like the liquor made?

22:58.580 --> 23:03.100
You know the liquor stick you lick it and then you stick it in the dust and the dust sticks to it

23:03.100 --> 23:05.100
But maybe it's savory

23:05.100 --> 23:07.100
Where would you keep those?

23:07.420 --> 23:09.420
Yeah in your wallet

23:10.180 --> 23:12.180
No, no, that wasn't it

23:12.980 --> 23:17.860
You're talking about breadsticks. First of all, damn it. You're right. You vented breadsticks. Congratulations

23:17.860 --> 23:23.580
I think you you could keep like a tube like maybe like a sheath on your hip that you keep the breadstick in a

23:23.820 --> 23:29.300
Sheath. Yeah, so it's like a sore about a straw. What about a very thick like milkshake II straw

23:29.980 --> 23:33.780
You can definitely die. So I'm just gonna suggest a shaken tap

23:33.780 --> 23:34.860
a

23:34.860 --> 23:41.060
Slow shake and take your time. Take your time. Don't be too anxious unless you're just like I this is how I live my life

23:41.060 --> 23:44.100
I live on the edge then, you know

23:44.740 --> 23:48.820
Or just combine all of the leave-ins into one bag over a period of time

23:49.420 --> 23:56.180
Mmm, and then just go for all at once just and lose yourself in the day. That's actually how they make everything seasoning. Oh

23:56.700 --> 23:58.700
Yeah, it's just everything

23:58.700 --> 24:03.500
Well at this point in the show we're gonna ask another question. Here we go. Hello

24:03.500 --> 24:05.700
I'm a middle school teacher in the Minnesota

24:07.340 --> 24:13.700
Okay, I accidentally stumbled across one of my students and her breakup tick-tocks about another one of my students

24:14.340 --> 24:20.300
One of her posts was literally a screen capture of their entire text conversation for the last couple months with the caption

24:20.420 --> 24:25.100
Watch the love of my life fall out of love with me. So obviously I needed to know about the drama

24:25.100 --> 24:29.820
I had to keep pausing it to read and I accidentally double-tapped and liked the post. I

24:30.620 --> 24:35.780
Unliked it, but I'm afraid she will see that I liked her posts. What do I do? Help me brothers?

24:36.660 --> 24:38.660
well, let me

24:38.700 --> 24:40.980
Let me start with a quick clarification

24:42.060 --> 24:48.580
You didn't that's where I was going. I bet you didn't stumble across anything right gene. They didn't that's double

24:48.580 --> 24:51.820
that is not an act you did not trip and

24:51.820 --> 24:56.880
And you're like, what's this? It's somebody I know it's one of my

24:59.220 --> 25:06.700
What a coincidence that out of the millions of users I've stumbled isn't the world I should follow them

25:06.780 --> 25:08.780
Just because of the happenstance

25:10.460 --> 25:13.300
I'm faded to see this because I've stumbled

25:14.100 --> 25:16.740
I'm meant to be here. Think of the good I could do

25:17.660 --> 25:19.500
Yeah, I

25:19.500 --> 25:21.900
Think that's the answer to the question

25:25.780 --> 25:30.020
Basically what we're saying is you called down the Thunder and now you got it

25:30.020 --> 25:34.660
Yes, you lean into it just start liking all of them and when they're like, uh, mr

25:34.660 --> 25:39.780
No, wait, no, okay Travis actually makes a good but trust it like you're a teacher. You're super old. I get it

25:39.780 --> 25:44.500
I'm super old to what you could do at this point is just go through and start liking

25:44.500 --> 25:51.740
Everything and just profess an ignorance of how the platform I like I like you

25:51.780 --> 25:56.060
So just liking all your posts or go the other way and when they're like miss Thompson

25:56.060 --> 26:01.780
Did you like the post about my break up like yeah good content good content. Say I'm loving it go viral

26:02.260 --> 26:08.740
I think your choices are are there's there's no middle ground here because you've already gone full extreme

26:08.740 --> 26:12.900
So you have to choose one of those options that have just been provided to you

26:12.900 --> 26:17.660
You could use their sound to make your own videos. Mm-hmm

26:17.660 --> 26:21.860
Yeah, just take the sounds from their videos and make just do at them

26:21.980 --> 26:26.300
That's a thing you could do stitch it together and then post it in class

26:26.300 --> 26:31.980
And then on the bright side after all of this you might go to jail and you won't have to see tick-tock again

26:34.580 --> 26:37.100
That's the only thing that would get me off the top at this point

26:37.380 --> 26:40.860
You gotta lock me up. Keep me away from it. Keep me away from that content

26:40.860 --> 26:47.020
I still feel I still have the feeling when I'm looking at tick-tock that I have stumbled into some sort of like

26:47.340 --> 26:54.260
Contraband like old-person contraband. Yeah, like I'm not supposed to be able to have access to this this amount of culture

26:55.020 --> 26:58.260
Yeah, it feels wrong. I know that I'm not supposed to be there. It's um

26:58.620 --> 27:05.340
I've I've now had the experience of like being in a bar or some instance where I'm like, oh

27:05.340 --> 27:11.660
These these people are I'm old enough to be everyone's mom and I need to go

27:12.300 --> 27:14.340
It's the record scratch moment, right?

27:14.340 --> 27:18.580
But the way I use a tick-tock is like I walked in there was a record scratch

27:18.580 --> 27:20.580
but then I also just sat down and

27:20.700 --> 27:27.060
Ordered a drink and just stayed for a while while everyone just continued to stare at me the whole time. I enjoyed my drink

27:27.060 --> 27:33.580
Hey, isn't that guy really old? Hey, should that old guy be did he order seconds? What's happening?

27:33.580 --> 27:38.900
You don't know life until you actually walk into a nightclub where your very famous

27:38.980 --> 27:42.060
DJ friend is DJing and they can't hear what you're saying

27:42.060 --> 27:48.900
So you go up to the DJ booth and you actually bump the record player and do the record scratch

27:49.460 --> 27:52.260
Thus the entire club turns to you

27:53.220 --> 27:56.060
Haven't Wow at that point Jean

27:56.060 --> 28:01.740
I guess you either leave or start doing a very good rap that blows everybody away

28:01.740 --> 28:07.980
Like those are your options right yelled. I was like what I was saying was and then just

28:09.220 --> 28:13.420
I was like just fucking lean into it. And that's where we're at one time Griffin and I

28:13.980 --> 28:19.620
He lived in Cincinnati with me and we lived in Batavia, which is like outskirts not a fantasy kingdom

28:19.620 --> 28:21.620
No, it's an area

28:22.180 --> 28:25.660
Outskirts of Cincinnati and we anytime we wanted to do anything

28:25.660 --> 28:29.280
We were always driving into Cincinnati to do something and so one day we were like, well

28:29.280 --> 28:32.620
We're gonna go on a quest to find like a bar around here

28:32.620 --> 28:35.620
That could be like a local place that we go to so we're not like driving 40 minutes

28:35.620 --> 28:38.460
They do a bar and so we were just hitting any bar

28:38.460 --> 28:43.700
We could find like on map quest or whatever the fuck and we found this one where we walked in and it was

28:44.380 --> 28:48.260
Pretty much felt like the bar from Pee Wee's big adventure. Oh

28:49.100 --> 28:51.220
And Griffin and I walked in

28:51.220 --> 29:00.020
Everyone literally turned and looked at us and we backed out and and left they should have I feel like bars

29:00.340 --> 29:07.020
Should have a sort of vestibule breezeway kind of thing with with one side of glass

29:07.380 --> 29:12.180
You know what I'm saying? We're like you could where you have like a 10-second grace period like oh, no, no

29:12.180 --> 29:14.180
No, this is wrong. I shouldn't have done this

29:14.500 --> 29:19.660
Right thing cuz I know I can't just turn and turn heel and walk. I tell you you guys are

29:19.660 --> 29:24.700
Like this experience is based. I would love that vestibule

29:25.260 --> 29:28.740
Because I would like to know driving across America

29:28.740 --> 29:33.100
I'm like being black and stopping at any random bar always feels like that

29:33.100 --> 29:38.260
And I would like to just know that there's a vestibule and it was like get out of here and I was like, all right

29:38.260 --> 29:40.260
well

29:41.260 --> 29:43.260
Any further

29:43.260 --> 29:48.380
We're just gonna get back I'd like a racist vestibule

29:51.700 --> 29:55.700
Generally tell by the town the town is kind of the vestibule, but you know

29:59.580 --> 30:02.140
How close is the cracker barrel to the bar

30:05.780 --> 30:12.540
We're gonna take a quick break and do advertisements and then we'll come back and there will be more show

30:12.540 --> 30:14.540
I'm I'm certain of it

30:24.060 --> 30:26.060
Oh these pants Oh

30:26.140 --> 30:33.260
These pants Justin these these pants that I'm wearing Oh these pants. Uh-huh. I got them through stitch fix

30:33.980 --> 30:38.780

concluding guys

34:35.340 --> 34:37.240
We don't have a choice

34:37.240 --> 34:39.240
We have to put on a show

34:44.640 --> 34:50.100
To six the final season on maximum fun

34:50.100 --> 34:57.100
We're about to yell squad.

34:57.100 --> 35:12.100
He'll say munch, Gene, and then we yell squad.

35:12.100 --> 35:19.100
Okay, now he's trying to impress you.

35:19.100 --> 35:23.100
I want to munch, squad.

35:23.100 --> 35:28.100
I want to munch, squad.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.100
Welcome to Munch Squad.

35:29.100 --> 35:34.100
It's a podcast within a podcast profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

35:34.100 --> 35:37.100
And we have got such a mass.

35:37.100 --> 35:44.100
This has never happened where a story has been this fucking fresh and hot off the presses.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.100
It's happening now.

35:45.100 --> 35:47.100
We're living in this moment.

35:47.100 --> 35:53.100
Domino's Pizza has brought back the Noid.

35:53.100 --> 36:01.100
The Noid, which they successfully did avoid for decades.

36:01.100 --> 36:09.100
The Noid has come home to Domino's Pizza, New York Stock Exchange ticker DPZ.

36:09.100 --> 36:14.100
It's the largest pizza company in the world and they've brought back the Noid.

36:14.100 --> 36:22.100
Now the Noid, they describe here as an anti-hero that has been trying to prevent great pizza delivery since 1986.

36:22.100 --> 36:27.100
I would just say that is a villain in my book.

36:27.100 --> 36:36.100
I mean, I guess it is literally the anti of a hero, but that's not what that term means.

36:36.100 --> 36:39.100
This is a wild press release here.

36:39.100 --> 36:48.100
And if you're I guess like younger than me at all, like if you're a young person and this is like lost,

36:48.100 --> 36:52.100
he looks like kind of like a superhero.

36:52.100 --> 36:53.100
Kind of like he was in the Incredibles.

36:53.100 --> 36:54.100
Yeah, exactly.

36:54.100 --> 37:04.100
Like that vibe with big red ears and he was a big thing in the mid 80s and he would try to like mess up pizza delivery.

37:04.100 --> 37:06.100
Sort of like the Hamburglar, but for pizzas.

37:06.100 --> 37:08.100
Yeah, exactly.

37:08.100 --> 37:10.100
And so you would try to avoid the Noid.

37:10.100 --> 37:12.100
There was a video game.

37:12.100 --> 37:13.100
There was a video game.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.100
There was a-

37:14.100 --> 37:17.100
And also shout out to rapper Big Noid.

37:17.100 --> 37:20.100
This is huge news for you.

37:20.100 --> 37:24.100
Yeah, that's going to get that Google juice going real nice for you.

37:24.100 --> 37:26.100
So the big, not Big Noid.

37:26.100 --> 37:28.100
Big Noid is not interfering with pizza delivery.

37:28.100 --> 37:30.100
Well, that we know of.

37:30.100 --> 37:31.100
That we know of.

37:31.100 --> 37:32.100
Right, maybe.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.100
Who knows?

37:33.100 --> 37:35.100
This is the press release.

37:35.100 --> 37:41.100
The largest pizza company in the world has always had one nemesis, the Noid.

37:41.100 --> 37:43.100
An anti-hero.

37:43.100 --> 37:47.100
An anti-hero that has been- you would think it's other pizza, right?

37:47.100 --> 37:49.100
Nope.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.100
Nope, it's a villain they invented.

37:50.100 --> 37:54.100
It's been trying to prevent great pizza delivery since 1986.

37:54.100 --> 37:57.100
I can't believe they put this in the press release.

37:57.100 --> 38:02.100
Maybe it was the chaos of 2020 that gave the Noid the confidence to return.

38:02.100 --> 38:06.100
Hey, are you fucking sure that that's the angle you want to go with?

38:06.100 --> 38:12.100
Are you telling me that Noid was watching TV and he saw the global pandemic claiming millions of lives and was like,

38:12.100 --> 38:14.100
I gotta stop pizza delivery.

38:14.100 --> 38:15.100
I'm back, baby.

38:15.100 --> 38:16.100
Now's my time.

38:16.100 --> 38:17.100
Yeah.

38:17.100 --> 38:19.100
This is my moment.

38:19.100 --> 38:27.100
Or possibly the fact that Domino's has continued to innovate around great pizza delivery with amazing technology.

38:27.100 --> 38:31.100
Whatever the reason that Noid simply can't stand it anymore.

38:31.100 --> 38:35.100
And the pesky anti-hero has returned in Domino's new television ads,

38:35.100 --> 38:43.100
which began airing today trying to thwart the advanced technology of Neuro's R2 robot,

38:43.100 --> 38:50.100
a completely autonomous, occupantless on-road vehicle out on a pizza delivery.

38:50.100 --> 38:52.100
Wait, what?

38:52.100 --> 38:53.100
What?

38:53.100 --> 38:56.100
Yeah, guys, here's what I'm saying to you.

38:56.100 --> 39:03.100
I watched this new ad, if you go to YouTube and search for videos of the Noid that have been posted in the last week,

39:03.100 --> 39:07.100
I watched it when it had literally 87 views this morning.

39:07.100 --> 39:16.100
And it is a truck, a robot truck, that is trying to deliver pizza.

39:16.100 --> 39:18.100
And the Noid's like, fuck that.

39:18.100 --> 39:23.100
I'm going to stop this robot from doing its job with all my different tricks.

39:23.100 --> 39:29.100
It just feels like it's a shortcut to vehicular manslaughter.

39:29.100 --> 39:32.100
This little robot, by the way, is so wild, y'all.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.100
I wish you could see it.

39:34.100 --> 39:42.100
It's just a tiny little pizza delivery robot and the Noid in a sort of man versus machine thing.

39:42.100 --> 39:48.100
He can't thwart people anymore, but maybe he can stop a super smart AI pizza delivery robot.

39:48.100 --> 39:50.100
I don't know why that would be the play.

39:50.100 --> 39:57.100
Can I just say just a little message to Domino's, if I might?

39:57.100 --> 39:58.100
Sure.

39:58.100 --> 40:06.100
Maybe, y'all, maybe just make better pizza.

40:06.100 --> 40:09.100
This seems incredibly elaborate.

40:09.100 --> 40:11.100
You had focus groups.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.100
You had so many meetings.

40:13.100 --> 40:16.100
You hired new people.

40:16.100 --> 40:19.100
You spent just maybe you could have spent that money.

40:19.100 --> 40:21.100
I don't know.

40:21.100 --> 40:24.100
Making better pizza.

40:24.100 --> 40:27.100
You know, it's also strange, Jean, now that you mention it.

40:27.100 --> 40:34.100
It is strange that they have introduced the idea, reintroduced the idea of the Noid at the same moment that they say,

40:34.100 --> 40:38.100
also, just a side note, we got robots to learn how to make pizza.

40:38.100 --> 40:41.100
Also, have you seen the robots?

40:41.100 --> 40:43.100
Don't worry about them.

40:43.100 --> 40:45.100
I'm sure they're fine.

40:45.100 --> 40:47.100
But the Noid, right?

40:47.100 --> 40:49.100
Don't worry about the pizza robots.

40:49.100 --> 40:52.100
They're fine and they're not going to ever do anything wrong.

40:52.100 --> 40:54.100
Did you say a robot truck that delivers pizza?

40:54.100 --> 40:55.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:55.100 --> 40:57.100
But look, he's back.

40:57.100 --> 40:58.100
Jean just raised a great point.

40:58.100 --> 41:00.100
Did the robot kill the Noid?

41:00.100 --> 41:03.100
The pizza robot can't legally kill the Noid.

41:03.100 --> 41:06.100
You can't try a robot in court.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.100
Law of robotics.

41:07.100 --> 41:08.100
Law of robotics.

41:08.100 --> 41:10.100
Rule number one, don't kill the Noids.

41:10.100 --> 41:15.100
So they basically have set up some murder robots.

41:15.100 --> 41:20.100
Some murder robots that are designed to do two things, deliver mediocre pizza and kill the Noid.

41:20.100 --> 41:25.100
The Noid, here's a quote, the Noid is Domino's oldest and most famous villain.

41:25.100 --> 41:27.100
Wait, what are the others?

41:27.100 --> 41:30.100
You all have a rogues gallery over there?

41:30.100 --> 41:33.100
Well, there's Cybernoid.

41:33.100 --> 41:44.100
The pizza delivery testing we're doing with Neuro's autonomous vehicle is exactly the kind of technology innovation that could provoke the Noid to return, said Kate Trumbull, Domino's vice president of advertising.

41:44.100 --> 41:50.100
However, after 35 years of practice in avoiding the Noid, we're pretty confident we know how to defeat it.

41:50.100 --> 41:52.100
What are you talking about?

41:52.100 --> 41:54.100
What are you fucking talking about?

41:54.100 --> 41:56.100
You invented it.

41:56.100 --> 41:59.100
What do you mean you know how to fucking defeat it, you lunatics?

41:59.100 --> 42:00.100
What are you talking about?

42:00.100 --> 42:03.100
Yeah, if you close your eyes, he stops existing.

42:03.100 --> 42:06.100
It's a manifestation of your own dark urges.

42:06.100 --> 42:11.100
Well, he used to be Justin, but now we don't know.

42:11.100 --> 42:14.100
Television screens are a great place for a classic nemesis to return.

42:14.100 --> 42:15.100
What?

42:15.100 --> 42:23.100
I hate the parts in these where I can tell it's a fellow human, same species as me and everything, that has to fill a paragraph.

42:23.100 --> 42:35.100
And they're like, I guess one of the things that I could combine words into saying is, while television screens are a great place for a classic nemesis to return, mobile devices are the newest place for the Noid to cause problems.

42:35.100 --> 42:39.100
So basically on May 7th, the Noid is going to join the new Crash Bandicoot game.

42:39.100 --> 42:40.100
What?

42:40.100 --> 42:42.100
In ways that I don'tâ¦

42:42.100 --> 42:49.100
So the Noid will be featured as one of the game's mini-bosses, pitting players against the Noid as Crash progresses through the story.

42:49.100 --> 42:51.100
Avoiding the Noid has never been so fun.

42:51.100 --> 42:53.100
Players will also have access to exclusiveâ¦

42:53.100 --> 42:54.100
No, just stop. No, just stop. Just stop.

42:54.100 --> 42:56.100
Yeah, thank you, God. Thank you.

42:56.100 --> 43:00.100
Domino's, you fucking make pizza and calm down.

43:00.100 --> 43:03.100
What the fuck are you talking about?

43:03.100 --> 43:07.100
Nobody wantsâ¦ I don't want a Domino's video game or a villain.

43:07.100 --> 43:13.100
I just wantâ¦ I don't even want you to make good pizza.

43:13.100 --> 43:17.100
Just do your best at the pizza.

43:17.100 --> 43:18.100
Know who you are.

43:18.100 --> 43:21.100
God damn it. What are you doing?

43:21.100 --> 43:32.100
It occurred to me that maybe, and this is hard to say, but the wildest thing about this has just occurred to me.

43:32.100 --> 43:35.100
Neuros is a separate company.

43:35.100 --> 43:36.100
Yeah.

43:36.100 --> 43:42.100
So that means that at some point a representative of Dominio's had to go to Neuro and say,

43:42.100 --> 43:49.100
hey, you know how you've developed a self-driving delivery truck and we're going to start using it.

43:49.100 --> 43:51.100
We love that.

43:51.100 --> 43:57.100
And so we think the best way to roll out that news is to bring back the Noid.

43:57.100 --> 43:58.100
Yeah.

43:58.100 --> 44:02.100
Don't worry about it because there's also a limitedâ¦

44:02.100 --> 44:07.100
The Dominio's has a limited number of hang in there and avoid the Noid t-shirts.

44:07.100 --> 44:09.100
What? Is it like the kitten?

44:09.100 --> 44:13.100
Yeah, it's just like the Noid hanging on something for purchase on Amazon.

44:13.100 --> 44:22.100
And guys, if you go and look, it's literally just like no branding, no anything, just like a picture of a shirt that says avoid the Noid.

44:22.100 --> 44:26.100
And it does have some great features on it, like a tearaway label.

44:26.100 --> 44:31.100
And it does say here in the features Noid design printed on front of shirt.

44:31.100 --> 44:32.100
Oh, cool.

44:32.100 --> 44:36.100
So that's huge if you want to put the Noid on your shirt.

44:36.100 --> 44:45.100
And yeah, you can share the Noid in GIF and sticker search engines on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok.

44:45.100 --> 44:47.100
I don't want the teams to find out about the Noid.

44:47.100 --> 44:49.100
Maybe some gluten-free options.

44:49.100 --> 44:52.100
Maybe some keto or vegan options.

44:52.100 --> 44:58.100
I'm just trying to suggest anything else that they could have done with this money.

44:58.100 --> 45:00.100
Maybe help the homeless.

45:00.100 --> 45:03.100
Yeah, so that's what's going on with the Noid.

45:03.100 --> 45:04.100
Thanks for keeping me.

45:04.100 --> 45:05.100
I've been worried.

45:05.100 --> 45:07.100
I haven't heard from him since the last reunion.

45:07.100 --> 45:09.100
That's what's up with the Noid.

45:09.100 --> 45:13.100
I have another quick bit I want to try real quick.

45:13.100 --> 45:14.100
Oh, my God.

45:14.100 --> 45:18.100
I've titled this bit, That's Interesting Trivia, Son.

45:18.100 --> 45:23.100
And what I did is I went on IMDb, looked up one of my favorite movies, and I pulled three bits of trivia from it.

45:23.100 --> 45:27.100
And I want you guys to guess the movie I'm describing.

45:27.100 --> 45:28.100
Okay.

45:28.100 --> 45:31.100
Is this going to be funny or is it going to be more of aâ¦

45:31.100 --> 45:32.100
Is it point break?

45:32.100 --> 45:33.100
Yeah.

45:33.100 --> 45:34.100
Is it point break?

45:34.100 --> 45:36.100
It's a little bit of a point break.

45:36.100 --> 45:40.100
I've titled it, That's Interesting Trivia.

45:40.100 --> 45:42.100
I mean, it's interesting.

45:42.100 --> 45:44.100
It doesn't always have to be funny, Justin.

45:44.100 --> 45:46.100
That's not what my comedy is about.

45:46.100 --> 45:48.100
My comedy is not about being funny.

45:48.100 --> 45:52.100
Sometimes it's making other people look funnier by comparison.

45:52.100 --> 45:56.100
The working title of this film was Hot and Cold.

45:56.100 --> 45:57.100
Is that it?

45:57.100 --> 46:00.100
That was the first one, yeah.

46:00.100 --> 46:01.100
Any guesses?

46:01.100 --> 46:03.100
Any guesses so far?

46:03.100 --> 46:04.100
No?

46:04.100 --> 46:05.100
Okay.

46:05.100 --> 46:13.100
This was considered as a vehicle for Corey Haim and Corey Feldman early in production before it was decided to make the leads older.

46:13.100 --> 46:15.100
Was their movie licensed to drive together?

46:15.100 --> 46:16.100
No, it wasn't.

46:16.100 --> 46:17.100
What was Corey's movie?

46:17.100 --> 46:18.100
Was it Ferris Bueller?

46:18.100 --> 46:19.100
Oh, good guesses.

46:19.100 --> 46:20.100
One more.

46:20.100 --> 46:22.100
And I think that this one's a giveaway.

46:22.100 --> 46:25.100
Body count, one.

46:25.100 --> 46:30.100
One person dies in this movie?

46:30.100 --> 46:31.100
Ice-T.

46:31.100 --> 46:32.100
Correct.

46:32.100 --> 46:35.100
Ice-T was in it because he was in Body Count.

46:35.100 --> 46:37.100
I'd like to get really elaborate.

46:37.100 --> 46:40.100
One person dies?

46:40.100 --> 46:42.100
One person dies.

46:42.100 --> 46:44.100
And it's a two-buddy comedy.

46:44.100 --> 46:45.100
Uh-huh.

46:45.100 --> 46:48.100
And the working title of the film was Hot and Cold.

46:48.100 --> 46:54.100
Wait, is it a comedy?

46:54.100 --> 46:55.100
Yes.

46:55.100 --> 46:58.100
And the Corys are in it or they were slated to be in it?

46:58.100 --> 47:01.100
They were planned to be in it, but then they made the leads older.

47:01.100 --> 47:05.100
And let me say that Body Count one is incredibly essential to the movie.

47:05.100 --> 47:07.100
Oh, it's Weekend at Bernie's.

47:07.100 --> 47:10.100
It is Weekend at Bernie's.

47:10.100 --> 47:14.100
The working title of Hot and Cold is the most bizarre of that.

47:14.100 --> 47:16.100
Because he was hot.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.100
And then he was cold.

47:17.100 --> 47:18.100
And then he was cold.

47:18.100 --> 47:21.100
Then he was cold when he was dead.

47:21.100 --> 47:26.100
Another slam dunk bit from Travis.

47:26.100 --> 47:28.100
Okay, let's help more people.

47:28.100 --> 47:30.100
I live in an apartment building.

47:30.100 --> 47:33.100
At the end of my hallway, there's an edible arrangement.

47:33.100 --> 47:35.100
I think those are two different.

47:35.100 --> 47:37.100
I live in an apartment building.

47:37.100 --> 47:39.100
And at the end of my hallway, that makes more sense.

47:39.100 --> 47:40.100
Thank you, Travis.

47:40.100 --> 47:42.100
There is an edible arrangement in front of a door.

47:42.100 --> 47:45.100
It has been there for several days and it is starting to look bad.

47:45.100 --> 47:48.100
I don't know these people, if they're home or not.

47:48.100 --> 47:51.100
But should I knock on the door so they could check outside their door?

47:51.100 --> 47:54.100
I'm afraid it'll look like I'm the person who delivered their fruit bouquet.

47:54.100 --> 47:57.100
Or a weirdo who cares about the weird old fruit in the hallway.

47:57.100 --> 48:01.100
Should I knock and escape through the stairwell next to the door immediately?

48:01.100 --> 48:05.100
Will it appear as though someone brought them an old, maybe spoiled, edible arrangement?

48:05.100 --> 48:06.100
What do I do?

48:06.100 --> 48:07.100
That's from Gina.

48:07.100 --> 48:09.100
I like to think it's from The Noid.

48:09.100 --> 48:10.100
It's from The Noid.

48:10.100 --> 48:12.100
Maybe The Noid's like, please take me back.

48:12.100 --> 48:15.100
This is why The Noid is trying to stop pizza delivery.

48:15.100 --> 48:17.100
Because he invested big in edible arrangements.

48:17.100 --> 48:22.100
And it hasn't quite taken off the way he had hoped as a pizza replacement.

48:22.100 --> 48:24.100
I like this question.

48:24.100 --> 48:27.100
One of the reasons I picked this question is because it highlights to me

48:27.100 --> 48:32.100
the way that sometimes the human brain can get spun up into anxiety.

48:32.100 --> 48:35.100
Because the idea that you would knock on this person's door and be like,

48:35.100 --> 48:37.100
hey, there's an edible arrangement out here.

48:37.100 --> 48:40.100
And that your fear is that they go, did you bring this?

48:40.100 --> 48:43.100
I don't think that's going to happen.

48:43.100 --> 48:48.100
But here's the problem is, I've been preaching this a lot on this show lately,

48:48.100 --> 48:50.100
and I'm just going to keep reinforcing it.

48:50.100 --> 48:54.100
You have to just act when the moment strikes.

48:54.100 --> 48:57.100
Because you always make it weirder by waiting.

48:57.100 --> 49:04.100
There's just no sense in, like, it's so much less weird to get to the end of the day

49:04.100 --> 49:08.100
and be like, I bet they'd want this fruit to not go bad.

49:08.100 --> 49:10.100
I want to give them a quick Nakarovski.

49:10.100 --> 49:16.100
It's so less weird to do that than to knock on the door and be like,

49:16.100 --> 49:19.100
did you want this rotten fruit or what?

49:19.100 --> 49:23.100
Yeah, because you will inherently, like, doing it spontaneously,

49:23.100 --> 49:28.100
you are more likely to nail the delivery than thinking about it for too long.

49:28.100 --> 49:31.100
Because the casual nature will be out the window

49:31.100 --> 49:33.100
if you've thought about it for more than 30 seconds.

49:33.100 --> 49:35.100
Fruit here, huh?

49:35.100 --> 49:37.100
Why did you not?

49:37.100 --> 49:42.100
Anyways, like, that's how I would do it.

49:42.100 --> 49:50.100
Yeah, the anxiety and the overthinking and the overanalyzing that you're doing with this,

49:50.100 --> 49:52.100
you could be spending your time doing a lot more.

49:52.100 --> 49:56.100
And I know that you are thinking about this a lot in the day.

49:56.100 --> 50:00.100
Like, so many hours and you've made so many movies in your head

50:00.100 --> 50:02.100
of the different ways that this goes.

50:02.100 --> 50:04.100
So you've got to knock.

50:04.100 --> 50:08.100
Also, you live in an apartment building, it's at the end of your hallway,

50:08.100 --> 50:12.100
and you don't want whatever is coming for these edible arrangements

50:12.100 --> 50:14.100
to end up in your apartment.

50:14.100 --> 50:20.100
And I don't mean like the Noid, I mean like vermin or roaches or whatever.

50:20.100 --> 50:27.100
So it is also very important that you take control of the situation.

50:27.100 --> 50:29.100
Just knock on the door.

50:29.100 --> 50:31.100
Don't leave them a note, because I know you want to.

50:31.100 --> 50:33.100
Don't put a note under the door.

50:33.100 --> 50:35.100
Also, they could be dead in there.

50:35.100 --> 50:37.100
Why don't you be a hero?

50:37.100 --> 50:39.100
Why don't you find out what's going on?

50:39.100 --> 50:44.100
Like everyone else, and because we are all sort of like everyone for themselves

50:44.100 --> 50:48.100
and we're living in this place, and especially in apartment buildings,

50:48.100 --> 50:53.100
I know that I didn't like to talk to neighbors or for whatever reason,

50:53.100 --> 50:56.100
or you may be an introvert.

50:56.100 --> 51:00.100
But right now you need to take control of the situation,

51:00.100 --> 51:02.100
because no one else is going to do that.

51:02.100 --> 51:07.100
Just to clarify, Gene, do you think, and I guess this is more subjective

51:07.100 --> 51:12.100
than anything else, but do you think that if you were the person to discover

51:12.100 --> 51:14.100
that a neighbor is dead in their apartment,

51:14.100 --> 51:17.100
would that get you to be considered a hero, or is that just?

51:17.100 --> 51:20.100
And I'm asking this, I don't know the answer.

51:20.100 --> 51:22.100
Oh no, I'd be a fucking hero.

51:22.100 --> 51:25.100
Because you don't know what's going on.

51:25.100 --> 51:29.100
Like they could have been, what if they've been like missing?

51:29.100 --> 51:31.100
You don't know what's going on.

51:31.100 --> 51:33.100
You don't know what's going on in there.

51:33.100 --> 51:36.100
Or maybe they've just been very sleepy and you've woken them up

51:36.100 --> 51:38.100
and they almost miss work.

51:38.100 --> 51:40.100
The problem, if you had done it the first day,

51:40.100 --> 51:42.100
it would have looked like you were concerned about them

51:42.100 --> 51:44.100
getting some delicious bread.

51:44.100 --> 51:48.100
When you do it four days later, I'm concerned about the mess you have here

51:48.100 --> 51:50.100
and I need it removed.

51:50.100 --> 51:52.100
Yeah, but you have to do it.

51:52.100 --> 51:54.100
You do have to do it, and you have to stop thinking about it.

51:54.100 --> 51:56.100
Just do it. Just do stuff.

51:56.100 --> 51:58.100
That's my motto.

51:58.100 --> 52:02.100
I listened to this book called The Five Second Rule,

52:02.100 --> 52:06.100
and the lady said that it was Mel Robbins,

52:06.100 --> 52:10.100
and she said that if you just do five, four, three, two, one, go,

52:10.100 --> 52:12.100
and just do it.

52:12.100 --> 52:14.100
Don't think about it any more than that.

52:14.100 --> 52:17.100
If you had done that, who knows what possibilities you could have.

52:17.100 --> 52:19.100
They could have given you one of the strawberries.

52:19.100 --> 52:21.100
Oh shit, maybe one of the chocolate covered ones.

52:21.100 --> 52:23.100
What if they opened the door and they were like,

52:23.100 --> 52:25.100
oh, your edible arrangements are here.

52:25.100 --> 52:27.100
And they were like, that's great.

52:27.100 --> 52:30.100
$1 million, and now you don't even know.

52:30.100 --> 52:32.100
Thank you. You've passed the test.

52:32.100 --> 52:35.100
This was a TikTok thing, and now you're rich.

52:35.100 --> 52:37.100
Here, there is one.

52:37.100 --> 52:39.100
I just don't know.

52:39.100 --> 52:44.100
People said it was too elaborate, but I'm so glad that it worked out.

52:44.100 --> 52:47.100
There is one problem though, Justin, with the just do stuff mantra,

52:47.100 --> 52:49.100
is if you're a person that has impulse control problems,

52:49.100 --> 52:52.100
and you think like, oh, I thought of a funny bit from my podcast

52:52.100 --> 52:54.100
that my friends and my brother will like,

52:54.100 --> 52:56.100
and then you don't really think about it beyond that,

52:56.100 --> 52:58.100
and then you do the bit, and then the bit doesn't work.

52:58.100 --> 53:00.100
You're like, why did I do that?

53:00.100 --> 53:02.100
It still works, you just have to adjust it to 50.

53:02.100 --> 53:04.100
Just count to 50.

53:04.100 --> 53:06.100
Okay, I'll try that next time.

53:06.100 --> 53:08.100
It also says it may be spoiled.

53:08.100 --> 53:13.100
I'm saying it's a fruit bouquet, and it's been there for several days.

53:13.100 --> 53:16.100
It has gone bad.

53:16.100 --> 53:21.100
My metric for is something okay to eat now is like,

53:21.100 --> 53:25.100
did it sit out long enough that I forgot it was there for a second?

53:25.100 --> 53:29.100
And if the answer is yes, it's a problem now for me.

53:29.100 --> 53:33.100
I watched too many, I worked a lot of food handling jobs in my youth,

53:33.100 --> 53:39.100
and I watched one too many instructional videos about the danger zone,

53:39.100 --> 53:41.100
and now it's way up in my brain.

53:41.100 --> 53:45.100
I throw a lot of stuff out that Quelle thinks should still be fine,

53:45.100 --> 53:49.100
and I'm like, you're insane.

53:49.100 --> 53:53.100
This is why I'm glad my wife, because Theresa is the same as Quelle

53:53.100 --> 53:56.100
in that respect, and the number of times that I've had to be like,

53:56.100 --> 54:00.100
okay, well, I need you to smell this, because I'm already thinking about it,

54:00.100 --> 54:02.100
and it's not going to work out.

54:02.100 --> 54:05.100
I don't see how you see that this is fine, or that you can pick around it.

54:05.100 --> 54:07.100
Don't do that.

54:07.100 --> 54:10.100
Oh, I also want to go back to the same, because there's a question,

54:10.100 --> 54:13.100
the part of the question says, should I knock and escape through the stairwell?

54:13.100 --> 54:17.100
Now, I think that you should knock, that you should have the conversation,

54:17.100 --> 54:20.100
but then you should also escape through the stairwell,

54:20.100 --> 54:24.100
and really present yourself as mysterious.

54:24.100 --> 54:28.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wait until they bend down to pick up the edible arrangement,

54:28.100 --> 54:30.100
and again, then you're gone.

54:30.100 --> 54:33.100
I've thought about how much different Batman would be perceived

54:33.100 --> 54:38.100
if he just walked away from conversations, because one, it's not as mysterious,

54:38.100 --> 54:41.100
but two, he always disappears in the middle of the other person talking,

54:41.100 --> 54:44.100
and if instead they looked over and they're like, where are you going?

54:44.100 --> 54:46.100
And he's like, I've got to go away now.

54:46.100 --> 54:48.100
And they're like, wait, no.

54:48.100 --> 54:52.100
No, we're still, I haven't told you where the asshole.

54:52.100 --> 54:56.100
It's one of my favorite things, that he just leaves.

54:56.100 --> 55:01.100
And in that, I aspire to be many different superheroes in many ways,

55:01.100 --> 55:05.100
because of their strengths, but Batman's goodbyes,

55:05.100 --> 55:08.100
it's so much further than Irish goodbyes.

55:08.100 --> 55:11.100
He knows when he has all the information he needs.

55:11.100 --> 55:15.100
And I wish someone would just like, here's how you fuck up Batman.

55:15.100 --> 55:20.100
You just never, never lose eye contact.

55:20.100 --> 55:23.100
And then you'll be able to see him clenching his teeth,

55:23.100 --> 55:27.100
and it's like, he really wants to go, but just never give him the opportunity.

55:27.100 --> 55:28.100
Never turn away.

55:28.100 --> 55:30.100
You blink one eye at a time, right?

55:30.100 --> 55:33.100
So you can keep the other one open on him.

55:33.100 --> 55:35.100
You can clockwork orange your eyes.

55:35.100 --> 55:39.100
And now by this time, the Joker has murdered a lot of people,

55:39.100 --> 55:41.100
but you got one up on Batman.

55:41.100 --> 55:47.100
He's like, oh my God, what would happen if you didn't give him the opportunity to leave?

55:47.100 --> 55:52.100
And then the sun rose, and now Batman's just walking home.

55:52.100 --> 55:54.100
I guess he would probably drive.

55:54.100 --> 55:56.100
I have work, I have to go.

55:56.100 --> 55:58.100
So how's everything?

55:58.100 --> 56:02.100
I like that I made him sort of Louis Armstrong.

56:02.100 --> 56:03.100
Yeah.

56:03.100 --> 56:07.100
How's everything, Commissioner?

56:07.100 --> 56:10.100
How come I only see you for work stuff?

56:10.100 --> 56:12.100
We never hang out anymore.

56:12.100 --> 56:18.100
I think if you just force Batman into the rest of the conversation that he refuses to have,

56:18.100 --> 56:21.100
that he would also be different.

56:21.100 --> 56:24.100
Hey, yeah, so the Riddler is attacking the Bank of Gotham.

56:24.100 --> 56:27.100
But also, how are you?

56:27.100 --> 56:30.100
How have you been?

56:30.100 --> 56:31.100
Where are you going?

56:31.100 --> 56:33.100
Come back, Batman.

56:33.100 --> 56:34.100
I'm back.

56:34.100 --> 56:37.100
Gina and I just had a whole conversation while you were gone.

56:37.100 --> 56:38.100
Oh, was it for the show?

56:38.100 --> 56:39.100
Yeah.

56:39.100 --> 56:40.100
All right.

56:40.100 --> 56:42.100
It's a lot about Batman, really.

56:42.100 --> 56:45.100
Thanks so much for listening to our podcast, My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

56:45.100 --> 56:47.100
We hope you've enjoyed it.

56:47.100 --> 56:51.100
A reminder, you can buy our merchandise at McElroyMerch.com.

56:51.100 --> 56:54.100
But I'm more interested in talking about Gene.

56:54.100 --> 56:57.100
How can people find more Gene Gray?

56:57.100 --> 56:59.100
Right now, don't.

56:59.100 --> 57:02.100
I'll find you, which sounds like a threat.

57:02.100 --> 57:07.100
I currently have deactivated my Twitter because I'm working.

57:07.100 --> 57:13.100
But you should be checking back with me in the upcoming months on my Instagram.

57:13.100 --> 57:15.100
And I'll come back on Twitter on my IG.

57:15.100 --> 57:17.100
It's GinaGrayzio.

57:17.100 --> 57:24.100
And then you can find me at GinaGrayzio on Twitter with some very important updates of what I've been working on for the past year.

57:24.100 --> 57:27.100
Yes, there are puppets involved.

57:27.100 --> 57:28.100
Whoa.

57:28.100 --> 57:30.100
Oh, boy.

57:30.100 --> 57:32.100
Justin, where can we find you?

57:32.100 --> 57:33.100
Don't.

57:33.100 --> 57:34.100
Don't.

57:34.100 --> 57:35.100
Don't.

57:35.100 --> 57:39.100
I'm deactivating mine too because it sounded cool when Gene said it, so I'm going to do it too.

57:39.100 --> 57:41.100
I'm reactivating your Twitter.

57:41.100 --> 57:42.100
Travis deactivated my Twitter.

57:42.100 --> 57:44.100
No, I don't know.

57:44.100 --> 57:45.100
I don't know.

57:45.100 --> 57:46.100
You've already found me.

57:46.100 --> 57:48.100
You're listening to my podcast.

57:48.100 --> 57:49.100
Thank you.

57:49.100 --> 57:50.100
Thank you for doing that.

57:50.100 --> 57:51.100
I appreciate it.

57:51.100 --> 57:52.100
Hey, here's my plug.

57:52.100 --> 57:54.100
Go get your fucking vaccine.

57:54.100 --> 57:59.100
If you can get your vaccine, go get your fucking vaccine, please.

57:59.100 --> 58:00.100
Just go get it.

58:00.100 --> 58:01.100
Please.

58:01.100 --> 58:02.100
Please.

58:02.100 --> 58:03.100
Please.

58:03.100 --> 58:04.100
Please.

58:04.100 --> 58:05.100
Please.

58:05.100 --> 58:06.100
Please.

58:06.100 --> 58:07.100
I want to see.

58:07.100 --> 58:08.100
I want to hug a person.

58:08.100 --> 58:09.100
Yeah.

58:09.100 --> 58:10.100
I want to see other people hug.

58:10.100 --> 58:13.100
I just want to watch people hug for money, you know?

58:13.100 --> 58:14.100
Wait.

58:14.100 --> 58:15.100
Hold on.

58:15.100 --> 58:16.100
Wait.

58:16.100 --> 58:17.100
Hold on.

58:17.100 --> 58:18.100
Hold on.

58:18.100 --> 58:19.100
Not through a TV.

58:19.100 --> 58:21.100
Screen in person so I can see them shifting awkwardly.

58:21.100 --> 58:22.100
Yeah.

58:22.100 --> 58:23.100
Okay.

58:23.100 --> 58:30.100
Thank you to Montaigne for our theme song, My Life Is Better With You.

58:30.100 --> 58:35.100
The full song will be available soon.

58:35.100 --> 58:41.100
By the way, if you're in a place that can support a Eurovision vote, if you've got a

58:41.100 --> 58:47.100
vote in the Eurovision, Montaigne is going to be battling it out.

58:47.100 --> 58:51.100
And because of various travel restrictions, she's not going to be able to come to the

58:51.100 --> 58:53.100
contest itself.

58:53.100 --> 58:55.100
So she's going to need all the votes she can get.

58:55.100 --> 59:02.100
So please support Montaigne in the Eurovision Song Contest, which I believe is on May 22nd.

59:02.100 --> 59:08.100
Can I also sing a version of a theme song for this episode that I've been thinking about,

59:08.100 --> 59:12.100
which is definitely not ripped from a commercial from the 80s about a product?

59:12.100 --> 59:13.100
Yeah, please.

59:13.100 --> 59:14.100
Sure.

59:14.100 --> 59:15.100
That'll be huge.

59:15.100 --> 59:21.100
My brother, my brother, wherever he goes, I'm going to go.

59:21.100 --> 59:24.100
My brother, my brother.

59:24.100 --> 59:26.100
Who's that?

59:26.100 --> 59:30.100
Me and my brother, my brother and Gene.

59:30.100 --> 59:32.100
That's lovely, Gene.

59:32.100 --> 59:34.100
See, you're a musical genius.

59:34.100 --> 59:35.100
This is what I'm talking about.

59:35.100 --> 59:36.100
How do you come up with this stuff?

59:36.100 --> 59:39.100
And people who don't have video don't see that Gene had those lyrics typed up and did

59:39.100 --> 59:41.100
not just in the moment come up with his shit music.

59:41.100 --> 59:47.100
I had them handwritten onto the wall with a Sharpie, so it's really in there now.

59:47.100 --> 59:48.100
It's permanent.

59:48.100 --> 59:51.100
It's not going anywhere.

59:51.100 --> 01:00:00.100
Anyway, I'm realizing terrifyingly that the way we end this show is by Griffin reading

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.100
Final Yahoo.

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:03.100
We have neither of those.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.100
I have a Final Life hack I can read.

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:06.100
Oh, thank goodness.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:07.100
That's perfect.

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:12.100
This was also sent in by Michael and asked by Madula Oblangada.

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:15.100
How to roast a chicken in a hotel room.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.100
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.100
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:22.100
I'm Jean McElroy.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:25.100
Thanks for listening to my brother, my brother, and Gene.

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:50.100
Kiss your dad, screw on the lips.

01:00:55.100 --> 01:01:08.100
MaxFun drives almost here.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:13.100
It starts on Monday, May 3rd, ends on May 14th, and it's the best time to support the

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.100
shows you love.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:18.100
Here are some folks like you sharing what MaxFun and our shows mean to them.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:21.100
Most importantly, it's meant community.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:26.100
And, yeah, just thanks for hanging out and making Joakim up and making my week a little

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.100
bit brighter.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:37.100
So, thanks MaxFun for making me a better person and making sure that I'm surrounded by better

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:38.100
people.

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:39.100
Thanks again for all you do.

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:42.100
Love supporting MaxFun and keep it up.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:46.100
Come back Monday, May 3rd for more details from your favorite hosts.

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:50.100
We'll have some of the best episodes of the year, special MaxFun Drive thank you gifts,

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:52.100
and maybe a few surprises.

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.100
That's Monday, May 3rd.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:02:20.100
Until then.
