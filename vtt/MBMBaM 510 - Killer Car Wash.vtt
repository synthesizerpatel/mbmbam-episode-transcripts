00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.080
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and Advice Show for the modern era.

00:48.080 --> 00:53.360
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.080
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Let's do it. Just do it.

00:58.080 --> 01:03.600
Just do it. Nike. We said last week, no more introductions. There's nothing to talk about,

01:03.600 --> 01:08.320
so no more introductions. Well, there's something to talk about,

01:08.320 --> 01:12.800
but let's not talk about that. There's something big worth discussing,

01:12.800 --> 01:16.400
but let's not discuss that one. I would like to pitch a new way to start the show.

01:17.440 --> 01:22.960
We're going to take it way back to our start, really. Community theater. Let's do an energy

01:22.960 --> 01:31.040
circle. Oh, that's good. Yeah, and then a prayer circle. That's less good. Let's start off,

01:31.040 --> 01:38.320
everybody, no matter what you're doing, just put your hands up in the air and just shake them all

01:38.320 --> 01:44.160
around. Oh, we're going to feel that energy go into you. And now me and Travis are going to do

01:44.160 --> 01:49.040
a private prayer circle over here, and Justin, if you don't want to be a part of that, you can

01:49.040 --> 01:54.640
go do something the fuck else while me and Travis pray to Jesus to make our show, Annie Get Your Gun,

01:54.640 --> 02:03.040
go so good. I was not going to pray to Jesus. Oh, no. Oh, no. You're going to pray to the theater

02:03.040 --> 02:12.640
mask God. Yeah. Let's cover our bases. I'll do Jesus. Travis does the comedy tragedy mascot.

02:12.640 --> 02:19.600
Justin, pick one. Dionysus. Okay. Dionysus. Oh, that's a fun one, huh? Yeah. All right,

02:19.600 --> 02:24.080
I'll start. Hey, Jesus, it's me. Apologies for my bros. They don't know what's up. I know that you

02:24.080 --> 02:28.800
love musical theater. I know you love comedies. Barefoot in the Park is your favorite. Today-

02:28.800 --> 02:32.160
Wait, really? Wait, Griffin, Jesus Christ Superstar isn't his favorite?

02:32.960 --> 02:38.080
No, he thinks he's played and he doesn't like rock. As we all know, he doesn't like rock music.

02:38.080 --> 02:42.800
Anyway, we're about to do Annie Get Your Gun, and it's really important. There may be scouts in the

02:42.800 --> 02:47.280
audience. Just let me shine, let me sparkle, and let me dazzle them. Please forgive my brothers.

02:47.280 --> 02:50.400
They're going to pray to people who aren't you, and I know you don't like that stuff.

02:50.400 --> 02:57.600
Hey, Thespo, it's me just reaching out to you. Let me hit them high notes. I hear there's going

02:57.600 --> 03:04.880
to be scouts in the crowds trying to take this all the way. I know I'm just backup dancer number six,

03:04.880 --> 03:10.720
but I think I've got potential. Anyways, I love you, and I'll see you at home.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.520
Amen. I didn't say amen on mine.

03:13.520 --> 03:22.160
Dionysus, it's me again, Justin McElroy. Yes, I come to you once more, the god of

03:22.160 --> 03:28.160
winemaking and grape cultivation and fertility and ritual madness and religious ecstasy and theater.

03:28.160 --> 03:35.280
I can call you Dionysus, I can call you Bacchus, but right now I'm just calling you my last chance.

03:35.280 --> 03:39.920
I really got to do good in my role as Frank Marshall in this production of Annie Get Your Gun

03:39.920 --> 03:45.760
that we are apparently about to mount on this podcast. I'm having that nightmare god,

03:45.760 --> 03:51.360
Dionysus, that I sometimes have where I don't know what the show is, but I have to perform anyway,

03:51.360 --> 03:56.960
except it's not a nightmare. It's real, and nobody knows what the show is, and we're all in it together.

03:56.960 --> 04:05.040
So, God, amen. Please, if you're not the real one, if you could just please send this to Jesus,

04:05.680 --> 04:12.480
if he's better for this. Please forward, I guess, to whatever, to whom it may concern.

04:13.280 --> 04:17.840
Yeah, I think we're gonna crush it. Guys, this has a wafting aroma of an introduction.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.960
No, it's not an introduction. It's just a prayer circle.

04:20.960 --> 04:25.680
This is just a prayer circle, and now energy circle. Everybody hold hands wherever you are.

04:25.680 --> 04:36.320
Okay, and I'm holding on to the two cybernetically linked robot hands that you all gave me as a

04:36.320 --> 04:41.440
present that mimic your hand. Oh, you're doing the jerk off just you're both doing the jerk off

04:41.440 --> 04:46.240
gesture. That is how I do. That's how I do energy circles. Should we start over again?

04:47.440 --> 04:52.560
Let's just do the first question. Yeah, first question. You know, we said no more introductions,

04:52.560 --> 04:57.600
and then we accidentally did one, and we can be better than that. We can be better than this

04:57.600 --> 05:01.840
together. Tonight, while preparing dinner, my husband said we had too many veggies,

05:01.840 --> 05:07.440
so he wasn't going to cook carrots. I said, fine by me. I don't really like carrots. This shocked

05:07.440 --> 05:12.560
him far more than I was expecting. He said he felt betrayed, and I should have mentioned this

05:12.560 --> 05:17.200
at some point in our six-year relationship before now. Thing is, I don't hate carrots,

05:17.200 --> 05:21.200
and usually I eat them without complaint because they're healthy. They're just not my favorite

05:21.200 --> 05:28.000
vegetable. Should I have mentioned this beforehand? Should I now sit down and come up with a list of

05:28.000 --> 05:34.960
things I'm just not a huge fan of or impartial to just in case? Or is he overreacting that's from

05:34.960 --> 05:40.400
just not that enthused in Australia? What a fucking great question. I only want to talk about this.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.240
Okay. All right. Why?

05:43.120 --> 05:46.480
I just think it's got everything that I like to talk about now.

05:46.480 --> 05:46.960
Carrots.

05:46.960 --> 05:52.080
Relationships, maintaining a long-term relationship, and vegetables, and where they

05:52.080 --> 05:58.880
are sort of at where I'm at. Can I talk about my journey with carrots? It's just that kind of an

05:58.880 --> 06:07.440
inverse of cheese. If you cook carrots, I'm so out. If you have them raw, I'll eat those crunchy

06:07.440 --> 06:14.720
little bastards all day long. You cook it, I'm completely out on carrots. I don't want to eat

06:14.720 --> 06:18.320
it either. Is it the hotness? Is it the heat? You don't like a hot carrot? Is it the mushy,

06:18.320 --> 06:23.440
the softness? It's the mushy and the sweetness. The mushy sweetness that I really don't enjoy.

06:23.440 --> 06:28.160
Interesting. I like it. That's what I like about a cooked carrot is it's like a vegetable that's

06:28.160 --> 06:32.560
kind of pretending a little bit to be a fruit. There is almost no vegetable. I'm sitting here

06:32.560 --> 06:39.200
trying to think of it. There's almost no vegetable that I fuck with equally in a hot versus a cold.

06:39.200 --> 06:45.680
I mean, right. Raw carrots, down. Raw celery, better than cooked celery, basically.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.640
Flip that, though, for broccoli. What the fuck? I hate raw broccoli.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.160
No one. No one.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.960
Raw cauliflower? Fucking debate.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.640
Get that shit off my veggie tray.

06:56.800 --> 07:01.040
Listen, the cherry tomatoes are gone. Boom. Everybody loves those little guys.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.880
Cherry tomatoes, they're gone. Cleaned out.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.120
I don't fuck with raw tomatoes.

07:05.120 --> 07:10.480
Okay, Justin, we can't talk about... It's not even broclivity. It's your anti-clivities.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.640
Some of the things you don't like.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.680
There should be a better word for that.

07:15.680 --> 07:25.920
Yes. But cherry tomatoes, I'm going to say your cherry tomatoes, your raw carrots, your raw celery,

07:26.480 --> 07:29.760
these things, they are flying off the shelves of the veggie tray.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.280
Those can stay. Those can stay.

07:31.280 --> 07:35.600
Oh, and maybe I'm going to speak up for a sugar snap pea.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.920
Oh, someone's got to speak at Travis's, the fucking Lorax.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.320
Some stringy garbage in between their incisors.

07:44.160 --> 07:48.400
It doesn't have the crunch of it. It's just got, I mean, it's right there in the name, a snap.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.000
It's got a snap. I like that.

07:52.160 --> 07:55.360
And this is good. It's really good that we get this taxonomy going on this show,

07:55.360 --> 07:57.920
because chefs don't know what the fuck to do with these things.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.040
Yes, thank you.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.440
If they're crunchy, let me munchie. If they're-

08:02.080 --> 08:03.280
If they're-

08:03.280 --> 08:05.440
Soggy, give to doggy.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.160
You're saying if the vegetable gets wet, feed it to a dog?

08:08.160 --> 08:13.120
Well, I mean, not all vegetables. You have to do what I do, which is ask Echo.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.280
I'm not going to say her real name because she's listening.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.120
Okay. Got you. I got you. I got you. I got you.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.680
If they're crunchy, let me munchie. If they're soft, cook them off.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.920
But what about broccoli and carrots?

08:21.920 --> 08:24.880
Those are soft. Oh, wait. No, carrots are crunchy. Let me munchie.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.080
If they're soft like broccoli, cook them off.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.120
Cauliflower?

08:29.120 --> 08:30.720
Is soft. Cook them off.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.440
Asparagus?

08:32.320 --> 08:35.040
You roast those. Roast those bastards.

08:35.040 --> 08:36.000
Gotta roast them.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.040
You gotta roast them.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.360
I have come to-

08:40.640 --> 08:44.320
I like- There's a few things that I-

08:44.320 --> 08:49.120
Even in my adult years, I'm like, nope, absolutely not.

08:49.120 --> 08:54.400
And I kind of enjoy that because I've come to eat so many different vegetables

08:54.400 --> 08:56.800
and be okay with so many different weird things

08:56.800 --> 09:00.160
that I kind of treasure the things that I'm still like, absolutely not.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.480
And my wife knows those things.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.840
Like, she knows like, don't put a water chestnut near me.

09:05.840 --> 09:06.960
Oh, fuck.

09:06.960 --> 09:10.080
Disgusting. They're so gross.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.720
What is it? You're not a nut.

09:13.760 --> 09:14.400
Why are you pretending?

09:14.400 --> 09:15.120
And you're not water.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.160
You're a- This- Okay.

09:19.600 --> 09:24.000
Fuck the first person that was like, I just found this.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.360
This tastes like a- Well, I'm trying to come up with a name for it.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.280
It kind of tastes like a wet nut.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.080
Is that anything?

09:30.080 --> 09:30.880
Oh, I got it.

09:30.880 --> 09:35.920
I'm going to put it in salad and vegetable bags and many Asian dishes.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.680
The fact that- Fuck water chestnuts.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.960
The fact of the matter is there's like nothing, no food stuff

09:40.960 --> 09:43.520
that I just like will absolutely not eat.

09:43.520 --> 09:47.120
Like if other people eat it somewhere, chances are I'll eat it.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.560
But there are plenty of things that if you like give me the option

09:50.560 --> 09:52.720
that I'd be like, oh, I'd rather have that than that.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.040
Like, you know what I mean?

09:55.040 --> 09:59.120
I just, I'm saying, let me get the thing that-

09:59.120 --> 10:04.000
Why I married to the woman I married to and why we are still together

10:04.720 --> 10:10.480
is that almost without fail, except for olives, which we both despise,

10:10.480 --> 10:13.840
the foods that I can't deal with Sydney adores.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.280
So it's like, slide those water chestnuts over here.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.160
I'm way in.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.280
I'm deep into it.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.600
Oh, you got a pickle that you don't want.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.760
Slide that pickle over my way.

10:23.760 --> 10:27.280
And I think that that maybe is what your husband is like.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.880
Oh, if you are not into carrots, that's a lot of carrots.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.000
I could have been scarfing this whole time.

10:34.000 --> 10:34.960
I could be enjoying them.

10:34.960 --> 10:38.480
If you're not enjoying these, these, the vitamin pack.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.840
These sweet little orange honey cigars.

10:41.840 --> 10:45.280
Or potentially your husband also doesn't enjoy carrots

10:45.840 --> 10:48.960
and was making them thinking you enjoyed them.

10:48.960 --> 10:52.400
Yeah, I never have to buy these fucking things again.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.960
Think of all the money we could have saved on carrots.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.760
If you are a person who has never eaten a vegetable in your life

10:59.760 --> 11:00.800
and you come to me and you're like,

11:00.800 --> 11:02.720
man, I've never eaten a vegetable in my life.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.480
I would probably look around the grocery store.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.440
I'd be like, well, here, try this.

11:07.440 --> 11:08.720
This is called a carrot.

11:08.720 --> 11:12.160
This is the veg- carrot is the vegetable, right?

11:12.160 --> 11:14.560
And if you eat carrot and you're like, ugh, gross.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.160
I'll be like, well, then there's nothing.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.760
There's leave the produce section.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.920
It's all downhill from here, man.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.920
I'm not even saying carrots the best vegetable,

11:21.920 --> 11:24.720
but like nobody eats a carrot and is like, fuck that.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.200
No way.

11:25.840 --> 11:32.000
Now what about, I might say corn is maybe like a better like entry.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.600
Yeah.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.080
Vegetable.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.640
But there's nothing that compares to corn.

11:36.640 --> 11:40.160
Like you can't be like corn and now here's some lettuce.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.400
Now here's like, if you go carrot,

11:42.400 --> 11:44.720
you can go carrot to celery easy.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.040
I love that Shanae O'Connor song.

11:48.160 --> 11:54.080
Nothing compares, nothing compares to corn.

11:54.080 --> 11:54.960
Can I do a Yahoo?

11:55.840 --> 11:56.320
I'm saying-

11:56.320 --> 11:57.840
Hold on, I got to call Weird Al.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.720
Okay, that was good.

11:58.720 --> 12:01.760
I'm saying, I think your husband overreacted.

12:02.640 --> 12:02.880
Okay.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.280
This Yahoo is sent by Graham Roebuck.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.000
Thank you, Graham Roebuck.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.560
It's Yahoo Answers user, Ray, who asks,

12:09.280 --> 12:11.840
this may be a short one, but I think it's worth talking about.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.280
Would I die if I walk through a carwash?

12:15.280 --> 12:15.600
Huh.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.520
Huh, okay, hold on.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.400
And we're talking about an automatic carwash.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.840
I don't think if you walk through a,

12:21.840 --> 12:24.160
if you walk through a self-service carwash and die,

12:25.040 --> 12:26.640
there has been foul play.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.800
Well, there's a logic puzzle in there, right?

12:28.800 --> 12:30.320
That's a murder.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.040
Yeah.

12:31.040 --> 12:34.240
There's a puddle of water on the ground and a man is dead.

12:34.240 --> 12:34.800
What happened?

12:35.440 --> 12:39.440
Yeah, but if you, I'm talking about you're behind the Sunoco

12:39.440 --> 12:42.960
and you've gotten the, and let's say just to again,

12:42.960 --> 12:44.960
make the rules as firm as possible,

12:44.960 --> 12:47.440
the most premium wash they have available.

12:47.440 --> 12:48.960
The most possible things.

12:48.960 --> 12:49.760
The most possible.

12:49.760 --> 12:54.000
I'm not talking about the $3 splash and soap bullshit

12:54.000 --> 12:55.600
where your car is dirtier.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.520
Don't fucking talk to me about the $3 splash and soap.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.240
My car is dirtier on the other side of that.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.200
I want the wax.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.480
I want the rainbow foam.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.720
I want all that shit, but I want it on my body

13:06.720 --> 13:08.000
and I want to live through it.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.360
Huh.

13:09.360 --> 13:13.680
I want to drive through a super powerful dryer

13:13.680 --> 13:16.080
that never works and has never worked

13:16.080 --> 13:17.520
and does not dry cars

13:17.520 --> 13:18.880
and I don't know why they're always there.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.920
It just pushes the water kind of around

13:21.920 --> 13:24.320
and it looks cool, but it's functionally useless,

13:24.320 --> 13:25.840
but I want that on my body.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.000
Would it kill you?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.120
Okay, let's go through the process.

13:29.120 --> 13:29.680
Okay.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.040
So you're walking through,

13:31.040 --> 13:32.880
you're going to get sprayed with water.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.320
We have to assume,

13:34.320 --> 13:38.720
you have to assume if you're a manufacturer of the car wash,

13:38.720 --> 13:43.120
you have to factor in a first step

13:43.120 --> 13:45.600
that is non-lethal to account for people

13:45.600 --> 13:47.120
that did have their window rolled down.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.800
They're just like, what the fuck?

13:48.800 --> 13:50.400
This is how it works, okay?

13:51.040 --> 13:53.680
So the first step, the initial rinse,

13:53.680 --> 13:56.320
I got to say that's almost certainly non-lethal.

13:56.320 --> 13:57.520
Not lethal, yeah.

13:57.520 --> 14:01.360
Well, not lethal isn't the same as,

14:01.360 --> 14:03.440
because I think what you're also assuming there is,

14:03.440 --> 14:05.440
a lot of damage will be done,

14:05.440 --> 14:08.320
but now you've figured out you need to roll your window up

14:08.320 --> 14:10.800
because then there are other steps down.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.200
And I feel like maybe if you get blasted

14:13.200 --> 14:16.800
in every step of the way, it compounds the damage.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.520
Interesting.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.680
You're weakened, your hit points are low.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.120
Yeah, you're definitely, you're bloodied.

14:21.120 --> 14:21.760
You know what I mean?

14:21.760 --> 14:24.560
Like, oh no, why didn't you roll your window up

14:24.560 --> 14:28.080
after you were sprayed by the high-powered foamy water?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.280
We're not going to be able to sort of arithmetic out the PSI

14:33.280 --> 14:35.040
of these nozzles, yes?

14:35.040 --> 14:37.920
But we can say, I can say pretty confidently,

14:38.800 --> 14:41.280
you blast yourself with a power washer,

14:42.320 --> 14:44.640
big rips, big rips up to GZO, you're done.

14:46.240 --> 14:50.160
But it's not power washer pressure in the car washer

14:50.160 --> 14:51.840
so it would rip the paint off the car, right?

14:51.840 --> 14:53.360
And if it's not ripping the paint off the car,

14:53.360 --> 14:55.040
it ain't gonna rip the flesh off my bones.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.760
So I do not think the spray pressure

14:58.480 --> 15:00.000
is gonna get me there.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.040
So next step, foam rollers, will those crush my petite body?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.720
I mean, you can push on a car harder

15:08.720 --> 15:10.240
than you can push on a person, Justin.

15:11.040 --> 15:15.920
They're not engineered, though, to squish a person.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.440
I don't know that they would get,

15:17.440 --> 15:20.000
no one goes through those things on their motorcycle, right?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.640
Like, they're not supposed to come in so far

15:22.640 --> 15:23.920
that they could crush a man.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.280
No, I agree with you, J-Man,

15:25.280 --> 15:28.080
that they did not design them to squish a person.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.080
But I'm saying- So they designed them

15:30.080 --> 15:31.520
to not squish a person. Yeah.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.520
Yeah, that's a toughie.

15:35.520 --> 15:36.000
I don't know.

15:36.640 --> 15:37.920
Well, you have to make a ruling on it

15:37.920 --> 15:40.640
so you can't just sit back on your fucking ivory throne

15:40.640 --> 15:41.600
and say, it's a toughie.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.640
Okay, I don't think the foam rollers are gonna kill you.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.040
I think that they're gonna be unpleasant.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.040
Hugely unpleasant.

15:49.040 --> 15:49.840
Because I'll tell you-

15:49.840 --> 15:50.960
What about the turny ones?

15:50.960 --> 15:51.440
Yes.

15:51.440 --> 15:55.600
Because that's the ones that are like vertical.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.000
And it's like a cat of a billion tails.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.080
That is going to just rip the flesh from-

16:00.080 --> 16:01.200
That would suck, actually.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.040
That would suck shit, man. That might actually mess you up.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.520
And we haven't even gotten to the undercarriage wash.

16:06.320 --> 16:06.720
Oh, boy.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.560
Like, oh, my beepus, no.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.240
That's gonna spray up through you.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.000
That's the terrible thing,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.480
because first you'll have the most profound

16:16.480 --> 16:18.880
and prolonged orgasm of your life

16:18.880 --> 16:22.400
as you discover your kink moments before you are killed.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.000
Yep. That is a tough one.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.200
Then there's also the wax.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.360
The wax is where I am.

16:27.360 --> 16:28.480
I'm fucked up now.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.720
Before we get to wax, before we get to wax,

16:30.720 --> 16:32.080
we need to establish another rule,

16:32.080 --> 16:34.960
which is, do I have to stand still?

16:34.960 --> 16:35.280
Okay.

16:36.720 --> 16:37.680
The rollers come at me.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.280
You mentioned the vertical roller, okay?

16:39.280 --> 16:41.920
Or the horizontal roller that comes in,

16:41.920 --> 16:43.120
I can duck under that?

16:43.120 --> 16:45.600
The vertical rollers, like, would it even be possible

16:45.600 --> 16:47.600
for me to stand still while these two rollers

16:47.600 --> 16:48.480
crush me from either side?

16:48.480 --> 16:51.520
Or would it sort of squirt me out one end?

16:52.320 --> 16:54.320
I think you have to keep feet planted,

16:54.320 --> 16:56.800
because otherwise you could go hide in the corner

16:56.800 --> 16:59.120
and this experiment is null and void.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.640
I think there is a way that you could say,

17:00.640 --> 17:04.720
this is a training session for American Ninja Warrior

17:04.720 --> 17:07.200
where I'm going to avoid these things that will kill me.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.680
But I think in the spirit of the question,

17:09.680 --> 17:10.880
will it kill you?

17:10.880 --> 17:13.600
You are committing to the experience.

17:14.320 --> 17:16.160
Yeah, you want to go on this ride.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.560
Okay, now we can return to hot wax.

17:18.560 --> 17:19.120
Yowza.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.600
Don't really have much else to add.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.520
I think the wax is quite hot, right?

17:24.320 --> 17:25.360
I don't know.

17:25.360 --> 17:26.560
I mean, I really don't,

17:26.560 --> 17:30.560
because again, like, I kind of feel like any spraying,

17:31.520 --> 17:33.280
they have to take a chance that somebody

17:33.280 --> 17:34.960
has accidentally rolled their window.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.680
Like, I think that you have to be able to withstand

17:38.240 --> 17:39.360
some of the spraying.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.360
I don't know if the wax is hot.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.200
Like, sometimes this has hot wax,

17:43.200 --> 17:45.760
and that I get, absolutely.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.320
I'm just not sure it's like murder hot.

17:49.120 --> 17:49.840
Huh.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.120
Yeah, but once again, Justin,

17:51.120 --> 17:52.480
I'm talking about a compounding,

17:53.360 --> 17:55.360
like you've just been slapped all over

17:55.360 --> 17:59.840
by a thousand, like, I don't even know what that's made out of,

17:59.840 --> 18:01.840
but it makes a thunk when it hits my car.

18:02.480 --> 18:06.320
Like, you are, I think, a thousand tiny cuts,

18:06.320 --> 18:08.480
a thousand tiny welts,

18:08.480 --> 18:10.480
and then you're getting sprayed by wax.

18:10.480 --> 18:14.400
Even if that wax is not like flesh melting,

18:14.400 --> 18:16.640
even if it's not boiling, it's warm.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.160
It's warm.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.560
It's not going to be a pleasant experience.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.520
Nobody's saying it's going to be a pleasant experience.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.120
No, but I'm saying it's horrible.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.560
Car wash, well, their car's going through it,

18:26.560 --> 18:28.080
and it's like, that's a pleasant,

18:28.080 --> 18:30.240
mama mia, that's a pleasant experience.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.600
I'm saying that by this point,

18:31.600 --> 18:33.280
you have been so tenderized

18:33.840 --> 18:36.320
that when you get to the dryer,

18:37.360 --> 18:40.160
even that pressure of air

18:40.160 --> 18:44.320
is just going to force all the skin off your body.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.280
Oh, wait, are you going through nude?

18:48.800 --> 18:50.560
Oh.

18:50.560 --> 18:51.680
That's too many variables,

18:51.680 --> 18:52.560
because then I can wear like,

18:52.560 --> 18:54.720
like, you know, I find out I'm going to be

18:54.720 --> 18:57.120
on this really fucked up high stakes episode of Fear Factor,

18:57.120 --> 18:58.560
and I can dress for the occasion.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.400
Yeah, I think you have to be nude.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.480
I think you have to be nude.

19:02.480 --> 19:03.920
I think you need to be nude.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.960
I think you want to be nude.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.040
Yeah, listen, you're not doing this

19:09.040 --> 19:10.240
if not to be nude.

19:11.360 --> 19:15.120
There's no news about a person

19:15.120 --> 19:18.320
being killed in a car wash that I can find.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.160
Oh, so there's not like an update on this?

19:20.720 --> 19:21.220
What?

19:21.220 --> 19:22.580
Oh, wait.

19:23.780 --> 19:24.660
No, never mind.

19:24.660 --> 19:25.860
That's a different thing.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.460
I don't like Googling deaths.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.900
Okay, I'm going to quit Googling deaths.

19:33.460 --> 19:33.960
I'm out.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.100
How about another question?

19:36.100 --> 19:37.380
A real palate cleanser.

19:38.100 --> 19:39.940
I hope this email finds you well.

19:39.940 --> 19:40.420
Thank you.

19:41.060 --> 19:43.300
So many people forget the pleasantries.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.460
It doesn't, but if you could turn it around,

19:45.460 --> 19:46.260
that would be neat.

19:46.900 --> 19:50.020
I've recently resolved to dye my hair a dark red

19:50.020 --> 19:52.420
after seeing a fellow coworker rock a bright red.

19:53.620 --> 19:56.900
I work as an EMT and colored hair

19:56.900 --> 19:58.500
isn't super common in the field.

19:59.060 --> 20:00.260
So it's going to be super clear

20:00.260 --> 20:02.260
that I'm copying her style.

20:02.260 --> 20:04.660
Ah, my question is,

20:04.660 --> 20:07.140
how do I dress the crimson elephant in the room?

20:07.140 --> 20:09.860
Do I just rock up one day like nothing's different?

20:10.420 --> 20:13.700
Or do I have to profess my envy of those ruby locks?

20:13.700 --> 20:16.100
As from hair color conundrum in California,

20:16.100 --> 20:18.260
this is actually a very challenging question.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.100
Yes, I'm having a difficult time with it.

20:20.660 --> 20:21.860
Because there is no like,

20:21.860 --> 20:22.740
oh, is yours red?

20:25.700 --> 20:28.980
There is no actor on earth that could deliver that

20:28.980 --> 20:29.540
in such a way.

20:29.540 --> 20:30.580
Your flave has been copped.

20:30.580 --> 20:31.460
You've copped the flave.

20:31.460 --> 20:34.660
Yeah, but I also think you couldn't in lead up to yours

20:34.660 --> 20:36.660
be like, I love that color.

20:36.660 --> 20:37.620
That's so good.

20:37.620 --> 20:39.300
Because then when you do it,

20:39.300 --> 20:42.900
it's just so like talented Mr. Ripley obvious.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.740
It's so creepy.

20:44.740 --> 20:46.260
It's so creepy.

20:46.260 --> 20:47.700
You have to address it.

20:47.700 --> 20:51.620
I think not addressing it is not possible.

20:51.620 --> 20:54.820
So the question has become even more challenging.

20:54.820 --> 20:55.540
How do you say,

20:56.100 --> 21:00.740
is it okay that I have chomped this flave so completely?

21:00.740 --> 21:02.260
Do you address it?

21:02.900 --> 21:04.580
Okay, let's answer this first.

21:04.580 --> 21:06.820
Do you address it before or after?

21:06.820 --> 21:09.700
Because I can't imagine the before would be like,

21:09.700 --> 21:12.900
I mean, hi, I just wanted to say

21:13.540 --> 21:16.340
that your hair is so beautiful

21:16.340 --> 21:19.300
and I just want to take it for my own

21:19.300 --> 21:23.940
and allow my ascension to the complete me

21:24.580 --> 21:29.300
of this crimson dragon that I and God are supposed to,

21:29.300 --> 21:31.940
I'll just take your hair and glue it to mine.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.300
Is that okay?

21:33.300 --> 21:36.180
I'm getting scared now and I don't like feeling scared.

21:36.180 --> 21:38.340
Why do you make me feel this way?

21:38.340 --> 21:39.700
I don't think that's gonna go.

21:39.700 --> 21:40.820
That's a worst case scenario.

21:40.820 --> 21:45.060
No, but the post, the after credits asking Justin is like,

21:45.060 --> 21:50.260
hey, I did this, what do I do now if you say no?

21:50.260 --> 21:53.300
Like, hey, was this okay that I did this?

21:53.300 --> 21:54.580
No, shit.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.620
I got it, I got it, I got it.

21:57.620 --> 21:58.900
You go to them, you say,

21:59.540 --> 22:00.820
oh man, your hair looks so cool.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.300
I've actually been thinking about dying my hair red for a while.

22:03.300 --> 22:05.380
Can you tell me, like, you got any tips?

22:05.380 --> 22:06.980
Long before you ever thought of it.

22:07.940 --> 22:09.860
Well, no, you don't have to frame it like that.

22:09.860 --> 22:12.740
You don't have to be the world's biggest jagoff,

22:12.740 --> 22:15.380
but you can make it feel like they are doing,

22:15.380 --> 22:18.260
like they're letting you in on the cool red hair club.

22:18.260 --> 22:20.820
Ooh, can you help me, like, pick a shade?

22:20.820 --> 22:21.380
Ooh, yeah, yeah.

22:21.380 --> 22:22.580
Will you help me pick a shade?

22:22.580 --> 22:24.260
I really think your hair looks cool

22:24.260 --> 22:26.180
and I have always wanted to do a look like that.

22:26.180 --> 22:28.420
And what better time to do it than now?

22:28.420 --> 22:31.700
Will you feel the sense of pride and satisfaction

22:32.260 --> 22:35.540
like Mama Bear and the Cub in teaching me

22:35.540 --> 22:38.260
how to make my hair like a cool punk rock EMT?

22:38.260 --> 22:42.740
And then we can form some kind of band of adventurers together,

22:42.740 --> 22:45.300
saving people every time.

22:45.300 --> 22:46.580
Every time you won't go in, like,

22:46.580 --> 22:49.780
a fantastical Mr. Fox bullshit direction.

22:49.780 --> 22:53.700
Well, oh, sorry, I forgot that you guys don't have dyed hair,

22:53.700 --> 22:56.340
so you'd, oh, yeah, you don't, yeah, it's fine, don't worry.

22:56.340 --> 22:58.420
Yeah, that definitely doesn't happen when you dye your hair.

22:59.140 --> 23:01.460
The important thing is that you keep dying it

23:01.460 --> 23:06.980
and as soon as new people come and get hired by the EMT company,

23:06.980 --> 23:12.260
you, you, you, hello, welcome to EMT code.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.940
We don't know what it stands for either.

23:14.980 --> 23:20.020
Remember, it's $5 for medicine, $10 for bandages.

23:20.020 --> 23:23.780
When they ask if they need to be intubated, that's $15.

23:24.580 --> 23:26.580
Don't forget to give them the menu.

23:26.580 --> 23:29.460
And if you sell 10 bandages, you get a bonus.

23:30.500 --> 23:33.700
Don't forget to wear your hairnet while doing EMT.

23:34.340 --> 23:35.700
And always smile.

23:35.700 --> 23:37.940
Smile, no matter what's happening.

23:38.740 --> 23:40.500
I'm giving you a promotion.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.420
Now you're Captain EMT.

23:43.220 --> 23:45.380
You get to drive the big van.

23:47.620 --> 23:50.420
And could you drop off my dry cleaning while you're out?

23:53.860 --> 23:56.500
I'm gonna tell you guys my smart thing I was gonna say.

23:58.740 --> 24:01.140
Oh, the EMT van's driving by.

24:01.140 --> 24:06.100
Does anybody need a bandage or medicine?

24:06.100 --> 24:07.700
Do you have any inhalers?

24:07.700 --> 24:09.940
Sorry, kid, just sold my last one.

24:10.580 --> 24:12.180
We are plumb out of inhalers.

24:12.180 --> 24:13.780
They go fast, man.

24:13.780 --> 24:15.860
It'd be better than our current medical system.

24:15.860 --> 24:16.740
Am I right, fellas?

24:17.620 --> 24:18.120
Wow.

24:19.460 --> 24:19.960
Wow.

24:20.580 --> 24:21.780
Wow, Dennis Miller.

24:21.780 --> 24:22.280
Wow.

24:28.180 --> 24:30.100
Anyway, should I do a Yahoo?

24:30.100 --> 24:34.020
Yeah, just make it, I think Travis actually, ugh.

24:34.020 --> 24:35.220
I don't like the way this feels in my mouth,

24:35.220 --> 24:37.700
but I think Travis had the best solution.

24:37.700 --> 24:39.300
Just enlist him in the process.

24:39.300 --> 24:40.180
That's very good.

24:40.180 --> 24:41.300
I don't think that was my solution.

24:41.300 --> 24:42.980
I think that was mine, but that's fine.

24:43.700 --> 24:48.900
I guess here's a Yahoo that was sent in by several people.

24:50.340 --> 24:55.300
It is a Yahoo Answers username, DJ Donnelly, who does ask.

24:55.300 --> 24:58.740
And I don't know if it's DJ short for like, you know, Danny Jean,

24:58.740 --> 25:02.660
or if they grind it out on the ones and twos,

25:02.660 --> 25:04.180
but DJ Donnelly does say,

25:04.740 --> 25:10.500
how to live to 75 by eating nothing but cakes and milk.

25:15.380 --> 25:24.660
This one is cool because I like that they are targeting 75.

25:24.660 --> 25:29.860
Yeah, 75 feels like, listen, I only want to eat cakes and milk,

25:29.860 --> 25:31.060
and I want to stretch this.

25:31.060 --> 25:33.220
I want to ride that train as long as it will take me.

25:33.220 --> 25:35.300
I do not think it will get me past 75.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.220
Yeah, they're not shooting the moon.

25:37.220 --> 25:38.900
75 is best case scenario.

25:38.900 --> 25:41.940
There are no 80 year olds eating just cakes and milk out there.

25:43.380 --> 25:48.020
Now, I like too that they are not asking if it is possible.

25:48.660 --> 25:50.980
They are saying, how do I do it, right?

25:50.980 --> 25:53.220
It's not like, has anyone done this?

25:53.220 --> 25:53.780
No.

25:53.780 --> 25:55.060
Someone's done it.

25:55.060 --> 25:56.180
Someone has to have done it.

25:56.180 --> 26:00.100
Now, this has introduced via a train of thought,

26:00.740 --> 26:04.260
has pulled into a station to tie this back to an earlier question.

26:04.260 --> 26:05.940
How do y'all feel about carrot cake?

26:06.660 --> 26:07.220
It kicks ass.

26:08.020 --> 26:09.300
Because it's got the carrots in there.

26:09.300 --> 26:11.220
So that's like a vegetable cake.

26:11.220 --> 26:12.180
Justin, what are you doing?

26:12.980 --> 26:13.620
Nothing.

26:13.620 --> 26:14.020
Thinking.

26:14.660 --> 26:15.380
Just thinking about it.

26:15.380 --> 26:16.180
Think out loud.

26:16.820 --> 26:17.140
Okay.

26:17.860 --> 26:19.860
Well, it kind of depends on the kind of ca-

26:19.860 --> 26:22.900
I just wanted to say something good and useful here,

26:22.900 --> 26:23.940
but it does-

26:23.940 --> 26:26.580
Cake is a very open-ended word.

26:26.580 --> 26:26.980
Yeah?

26:26.980 --> 26:27.620
Yeah.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.860
So there's like healthy cakes.

26:29.860 --> 26:32.500
But is that healthy or healthier?

26:33.060 --> 26:35.300
Everything's healthy in moderation, Travis.

26:35.300 --> 26:36.260
It's what I keep telling you.

26:36.260 --> 26:38.820
That's why I have all these dealer meal cards spread out everywhere.

26:40.500 --> 26:41.700
It's called Dealer Cake.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.060
It's this new program.

26:43.060 --> 26:47.300
You have like a breakfast cake, probably coffee cake, right?

26:47.300 --> 26:53.700
And then you have a sumptuous evening cake, like a crab cake.

26:54.500 --> 26:59.060
And for lunch, there's urinal cakes.

26:59.060 --> 26:59.940
Oh, nope.

26:59.940 --> 27:00.420
No, no, no.

27:00.420 --> 27:01.620
What does that do?

27:01.620 --> 27:02.980
What's that do for your health, Justin?

27:02.980 --> 27:03.860
Tell me now.

27:03.860 --> 27:05.700
That- I was just a different kind-

27:05.700 --> 27:07.540
I was trying to come up with different kinds of cake.

27:07.540 --> 27:09.700
You two have made me hate this question.

27:09.700 --> 27:11.140
And now I'll do a different one.

27:11.140 --> 27:12.180
Healthy milks too.

27:12.180 --> 27:13.060
Hemp milk.

27:13.060 --> 27:14.340
Milk that gets you high.

27:14.340 --> 27:14.980
Nice.

27:14.980 --> 27:15.860
Now I'm back in.

27:15.860 --> 27:17.540
Oh, we talking about hemp milk.

27:17.540 --> 27:18.100
I'm back in.

27:18.820 --> 27:21.140
You know me, I'm a major weed head these days.

27:21.940 --> 27:25.460
And I won't touch nothing if it hasn't been wrung out of some hemp.

27:25.460 --> 27:26.260
Should I do a Yahoo?

27:26.260 --> 27:29.940
Do you think we've earned the right to go give some money from this episode?

27:29.940 --> 27:32.740
I think I want to get some money from this episode.

27:32.740 --> 27:33.540
All right, guys.

27:33.540 --> 27:47.060
All right, guys, we promise we'll do it real quick.

27:51.060 --> 27:52.180
You know what you should eat?

27:53.380 --> 27:54.100
What's that, Trav?

27:54.660 --> 27:56.100
You should eat Blue Apron.

27:56.100 --> 28:01.620
It's like the cakes of boxed prepackaged pre-proportioned Beals.

28:01.620 --> 28:03.620
Did you say Beals?

28:03.620 --> 28:05.380
Beals of Jessica Beals.

28:05.380 --> 28:08.340
It's a full crate of beetles delivered right to your home.

28:09.220 --> 28:10.100
Blue Beetle Apron.

28:10.100 --> 28:10.340
That's good.

28:11.060 --> 28:13.060
That's dope because I'm Timon and Pumbaa.

28:13.700 --> 28:14.980
Love them Juicy Bugs.

28:15.700 --> 28:16.820
They love eating Juicy Bugs.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.420
But no, they're not going to send you Juicy Bugs.

28:18.420 --> 28:19.540
They probably don't want us saying that.

28:19.540 --> 28:23.460
They're going to send you fresh quality non-bug ingredients delivered straight to your door.

28:23.460 --> 28:26.580
And you can cook delicious, easy meals in the comfort of your home.

28:26.580 --> 28:30.740
The premium recipes take it a step further and give you a truly unique experience.

28:30.740 --> 28:32.660
It's like bringing the restaurant home.

28:32.660 --> 28:33.860
Which restaurant?

28:33.860 --> 28:35.060
You decide.

28:35.060 --> 28:36.020
Even if there's-

28:36.020 --> 28:36.580
What?

28:36.580 --> 28:40.180
I have- I made one of these and it had a thing in it that I've never-

28:40.180 --> 28:42.900
Like I was making food that I've never even heard of before.

28:42.900 --> 28:43.780
It was amazing.

28:43.780 --> 28:44.020
What?

28:44.660 --> 28:44.980
Yes.

28:46.260 --> 28:50.580
I'm going to embarrass myself if I say what it was because it-

28:50.580 --> 28:52.900
People will probably be like, you never had that?

28:52.900 --> 28:54.100
I have that all the time.

28:54.740 --> 28:56.740
But it was like a potato thing.

28:56.740 --> 28:59.860
I can't remember what it was called because it's like so great.

28:59.860 --> 29:01.300
French fries?

29:01.300 --> 29:01.620
What?

29:01.620 --> 29:02.180
French fries?

29:02.980 --> 29:03.540
No, it was-

29:03.540 --> 29:05.780
Was it a sweet potato?

29:05.780 --> 29:10.020
No, it was a potato rosti.

29:11.380 --> 29:12.660
Or rosti, perhaps.

29:14.740 --> 29:17.700
That sounds like you're talking about like a roasted potato,

29:17.700 --> 29:20.580
but you're also like a really fucking cool surfer.

29:20.580 --> 29:21.380
No, it's like a rosti.

29:21.380 --> 29:21.940
Rosti.

29:21.940 --> 29:22.500
Shut up.

29:22.500 --> 29:24.900
You're coming with me to the potato rosti.

29:24.900 --> 29:25.540
Shut up, bro.

29:26.580 --> 29:28.020
This is taking too long.

29:28.020 --> 29:30.740
I'm just saying that it's a rosti.

29:30.740 --> 29:32.100
It's like a potato pancake.

29:32.100 --> 29:32.980
It's good.

29:32.980 --> 29:33.700
It's swish.

29:34.500 --> 29:34.980
Swiss.

29:35.540 --> 29:35.860
Fuck!

29:35.860 --> 29:36.900
Blue Apron is the first-

29:36.900 --> 29:37.780
Swish, Scott!

29:38.580 --> 29:40.820
We going to the potato rosti swish, bro!

29:44.420 --> 29:46.580
Anyway, find comfort in the kitchen with Blue Apron

29:46.580 --> 29:48.340
and enjoy delicious home-cooked meals.

29:48.340 --> 29:50.580
Visit blueapron.com to check out this week's menu.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.700
That's blueapron.com.

29:51.700 --> 29:58.020
Blue Apron, feed your soul.

29:58.020 --> 29:59.460
Oh no, I don't understand you.

30:00.900 --> 30:01.540
Well, you would.

30:03.060 --> 30:06.180
If you had learned that language I just made up on babble.

30:06.180 --> 30:07.460
See, I was babbling.

30:07.460 --> 30:09.860
So I was hoping that that was-

30:09.860 --> 30:10.820
No, I got that.

30:12.420 --> 30:14.500
No, I've been doing babble,

30:14.500 --> 30:19.140
which is a great way to learn a language

30:19.140 --> 30:22.260
or even relearn a language.

30:22.260 --> 30:25.700
If you had one back in high school

30:26.260 --> 30:28.820
and you kind of lost it a little bit,

30:28.820 --> 30:30.980
babble gets you sharpened up real quick.

30:32.180 --> 30:35.860
I have really dug that it's more conversational

30:35.860 --> 30:37.940
than a lot of other foreign language apps

30:37.940 --> 30:39.620
that I've tried before.

30:39.620 --> 30:41.540
And baby, I've tried them all.

30:43.940 --> 30:44.420
You're having conversations-

30:44.420 --> 30:46.340
Did you get so enthusiastic about that

30:46.340 --> 30:48.420
that you uppercutted your microphone?

30:48.420 --> 30:49.860
I can always tell when it happens.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.620
No, there's a dragon punch.

30:52.820 --> 30:54.980
It starts with conversations really early.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.220
So it's not just vocabulary.

30:57.220 --> 30:58.180
You're discussing things.

30:59.940 --> 31:03.140
The words are organized by ideas and conversations

31:03.140 --> 31:05.300
you might have rather than just vocab.

31:06.260 --> 31:11.220
So it's a really cool, much easier way to learn a language.

31:11.220 --> 31:14.740
And right now babble, B-A-B-B-E-L

31:14.740 --> 31:16.580

31:31.220 --> 31:33.700
Babble, language for life.

31:33.700 --> 31:36.100
Welcome.

31:36.100 --> 31:36.500
Thank you.

31:37.300 --> 31:40.100
These are real podcast listeners, not actors.

31:40.900 --> 31:43.060
What do you look for in a podcast?

31:43.060 --> 31:44.980
Reliability is big for me.

31:44.980 --> 31:45.700
Power.

31:45.700 --> 31:46.660
I'd say comfort.

31:47.220 --> 31:48.020
What do you think of this?

31:52.420 --> 31:53.620
That's Jordan Jesse Go.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.660
Jordan Jesse Go?

31:54.660 --> 31:55.940
They came out of the floor?

31:57.140 --> 31:58.740
And down from the ceiling?

31:58.740 --> 32:00.020
That can't be safe.

32:00.580 --> 32:01.300
I'm upset.

32:01.940 --> 32:02.660
Can we go now?

32:03.220 --> 32:03.620
Soon.

32:05.620 --> 32:08.180
Jordan Jesse Go, a real podcast.

32:10.980 --> 32:11.940
Here's another question.

32:12.980 --> 32:14.820
I have always wanted to hold a pigeon.

32:14.820 --> 32:18.100
The city pigeons seem like such funky little docile guys,

32:18.100 --> 32:20.740
and I'm curious to see if they would let me get close enough

32:20.740 --> 32:22.580
to let me scoop one up in my hands.

32:22.580 --> 32:25.060
However, my girlfriend does not think this is a good idea.

32:25.060 --> 32:26.260
She's worried I'd get attacked

32:26.260 --> 32:28.420
or contract some sort of disease from said bird.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.980
Please either help me to convince her

32:30.980 --> 32:32.260
that this is a safe plan

32:32.260 --> 32:34.580
or talk me out of trying to snag a pigeon

32:34.580 --> 32:36.020
next time I'm in a city.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.460
That's from The Pigeon Pal.

32:39.700 --> 32:40.820
I don't actually know.

32:40.820 --> 32:41.300
You know what?

32:41.300 --> 32:41.940
I actually have...

32:42.980 --> 32:44.500
Let me make...

32:44.500 --> 32:48.580
Who could possibly possess a level of expertise

32:48.580 --> 32:48.980
about this exact subject?

32:48.980 --> 32:52.020
Oh, I bet it's the pigeon lady from Home Alone 2.

32:52.020 --> 32:53.140
Is it Brenda Fricker, Justin?

32:53.140 --> 32:54.180
Do you have Brenda Fricker?

32:56.420 --> 32:57.140
It's a lot of numbers.

32:57.140 --> 32:58.180
That's too many numbers.

32:59.860 --> 33:01.300
Still calling.

33:02.900 --> 33:03.860
Still calling.

33:03.860 --> 33:05.860
It's the MC Bat Commander,

33:05.860 --> 33:07.300
the lead singer of the Aquabats.

33:07.300 --> 33:08.420
Hold on, let me see if he's...

33:08.420 --> 33:12.260
Wait, you're gonna use our one token?

33:12.260 --> 33:13.620
Yeah, he gave me this token

33:13.620 --> 33:15.620
to whenever we're in need,

33:15.620 --> 33:17.460
and I feel like this is pretty dire.

33:18.260 --> 33:20.580
Hello, this is the Bat Commander.

33:20.580 --> 33:21.860
What can I do for you?

33:22.660 --> 33:23.460
Hey, it's us.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.420
We're using our token.

33:24.420 --> 33:25.140
It's the McElroy Brothers.

33:25.140 --> 33:26.820
You remember the token you gave us?

33:26.820 --> 33:28.020
You said it for anything?

33:28.820 --> 33:29.780
Sure, yeah.

33:30.980 --> 33:31.700
Who is this again?

33:33.700 --> 33:34.500
McElroy Brothers.

33:36.100 --> 33:37.300
We did your show for free,

33:37.300 --> 33:39.380
and you said that there'd be money,

33:39.380 --> 33:40.660
but then there wasn't money,

33:40.660 --> 33:42.820
and so instead you gave us this token

33:42.820 --> 33:44.420
that does have Chuck E. Cheese on it.

33:44.420 --> 33:45.700
How are you guys?

33:45.700 --> 33:46.740
We're doing good.

33:47.540 --> 33:49.860
Bat Commander, where are you at on pigeons?

33:50.900 --> 33:52.660
Well, pigeons, pigeons.

33:53.780 --> 33:58.260
I feel like pigeons are our friends.

33:58.260 --> 34:01.460
Like many of the animals we are friends with,

34:01.460 --> 34:02.820
pigeons are some of them.

34:03.940 --> 34:06.660
Where do you sit on scooping up animals

34:06.660 --> 34:09.620
in the line of duty protecting Earth?

34:09.620 --> 34:12.260
Have you had occasion to scoop up animals?

34:12.260 --> 34:16.260
What's your sort of track record on animal scooping?

34:16.260 --> 34:17.780
Yeah, there has been a few times

34:17.780 --> 34:22.180
where there has been some necessary scooping of animals,

34:22.180 --> 34:24.500
you know, scooping them out of the street,

34:25.300 --> 34:27.060
catching some baby chicks

34:27.060 --> 34:29.700
before they get run over by a Stingray Corvette,

34:30.340 --> 34:32.100
things like this, you know.

34:32.100 --> 34:36.180
How often does that happen, the Stingray Corvette line?

34:36.180 --> 34:39.060
You wouldn't believe how much baby chicks

34:39.060 --> 34:40.980
are attracted to Stingray Corvettes.

34:40.980 --> 34:44.500
They love those 70s muscle cars, yes.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.020
You might say it's kind of a chick magnet.

34:46.020 --> 34:46.820
There you go.

34:46.820 --> 34:48.180
Oh my God.

34:48.180 --> 34:49.620
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

34:50.420 --> 34:51.700
Here's the deal with the pigeons.

34:51.700 --> 34:53.060
Let's just level with this.

34:53.060 --> 34:54.420
Let's just level with it.

34:54.420 --> 34:56.740
Finally, let's cut through all the ball crap.

34:56.740 --> 34:58.820
Human relationships are important.

34:58.820 --> 35:02.500
His girlfriend is scared of the pigeons, okay?

35:02.500 --> 35:05.060
Pigeon attacks are on the rise, it is true.

35:05.060 --> 35:08.180
I mean, there's thousands of pigeons out there, ready?

35:08.180 --> 35:10.500
I mean, and pigeons.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.980
Right now, they're desperate to find anyone to attack.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.180
They are so hungry.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.860
Can you imagine how many french fries

35:15.860 --> 35:20.500
they're not eating every day from street cafes?

35:21.300 --> 35:25.300
Those potato chips and chickpeas off of salads

35:25.300 --> 35:26.340
that they can't eat.

35:26.340 --> 35:28.740
Pigeons are starved and they are pissed off.

35:28.740 --> 35:29.620
That's right.

35:29.620 --> 35:31.140
Pigeons are angry.

35:31.140 --> 35:33.540
So I can feel her pain, but at the same time,

35:33.540 --> 35:37.780
any man, woman, whatever, that feels the need

35:37.780 --> 35:41.220
to scoop an animal needs to get that scoop off their chest.

35:41.220 --> 35:44.420
If you know what I mean.

35:44.420 --> 35:46.340
Get that scoop right off your chest.

35:46.340 --> 35:51.300
But it feels like there could be like an oils on the hands.

35:51.300 --> 35:53.540
You know how you're not supposed to touch stalactites

35:53.540 --> 35:55.620
or stalagmites when you're in a cave system

35:55.620 --> 35:58.340
because your oils will forever leave an imprint.

35:58.340 --> 35:59.700
Right, I've heard that, I've heard that.

35:59.700 --> 36:02.900
Yeah, if the oils on my hands somehow like

36:02.900 --> 36:07.860
coat the pigeon's wings in some sort of anti-flying juice.

36:07.860 --> 36:08.420
That's true.

36:09.220 --> 36:10.980
Is that a concern?

36:10.980 --> 36:14.100
You know, pigeons are remarkable, remarkable animals

36:14.100 --> 36:18.580
and we have to respect them and get our oils on them, right?

36:19.860 --> 36:22.980
Essential oils, human oils, whatever it may be.

36:24.180 --> 36:24.660
Olive oils.

36:24.660 --> 36:27.860
Essential worker oils, all of those things.

36:28.900 --> 36:30.820
But here's the thing.

36:30.820 --> 36:35.140
Pigeons are the ancestors of our phones.

36:35.780 --> 36:36.820
Let's face it, guys.

36:36.820 --> 36:37.380
I mean, right?

36:39.780 --> 36:41.940
Pigeons are caveman phones, right?

36:44.100 --> 36:47.620
Tape messages to pigeons and they fly and deliver messages.

36:47.620 --> 36:49.140
So we have to respect the pigeons

36:49.780 --> 36:51.860
and that's why they live in the cities.

36:51.860 --> 36:53.940
That's why we give the pigeons the licenses

36:53.940 --> 36:55.940
to live where they do, right?

36:55.940 --> 36:59.380
Maybe instead of just staring down at your phone all day,

36:59.380 --> 37:01.700
like all of us are doing, like Banksy said,

37:01.700 --> 37:03.300
in that one piece of art,

37:03.300 --> 37:07.140
maybe look at the pigeons because they were phones

37:07.140 --> 37:09.060
and we used to just stare at pigeons

37:09.060 --> 37:10.420
and I would love to go back to that.

37:10.420 --> 37:11.460
Let's go back.

37:11.460 --> 37:12.260
Let's go back.

37:13.620 --> 37:16.820
I tried to use a pigeon as a cell phone once,

37:16.820 --> 37:19.140
but the only game that would work on it was Angry Bird.

37:21.140 --> 37:21.940
That's two!

37:21.940 --> 37:23.940
It's just fucking full of them, man.

37:24.980 --> 37:26.260
Incredible!

37:26.260 --> 37:27.620
That was really good.

37:27.620 --> 37:30.980
Hey, we were on the Aquabats show

37:30.980 --> 37:33.940
and I'm assuming that's available on YouTube now

37:33.940 --> 37:35.860
as people are listening to this.

37:35.860 --> 37:36.420
Yes.

37:36.420 --> 37:37.220
Yes, that's right.

37:37.860 --> 37:38.500
It came out.

37:39.300 --> 37:42.340
The Shrinky Bats episode of the Aquabats Super Show

37:42.340 --> 37:46.180
just came out and you guys are so fine in it.

37:46.180 --> 37:46.980
You're great.

37:46.980 --> 37:48.340
Your acting skills,

37:49.140 --> 37:51.620
the pigeons that surrounded the hot dog cart,

37:51.620 --> 37:56.100
that Justin was soliciting people's businesses,

37:56.100 --> 37:58.980
the essential business of selling hot dogs

37:58.980 --> 38:00.100
to people on the street.

38:01.220 --> 38:02.580
It's fantastic.

38:02.580 --> 38:04.180
Watching and enjoying that episode,

38:04.180 --> 38:06.420
I don't think anyone will appreciate

38:06.420 --> 38:10.740
the amount of discomfort that was involved

38:10.740 --> 38:11.860
with the shooting of this.

38:12.900 --> 38:14.660
It was cold, it was blustery,

38:14.660 --> 38:19.220
and I had to pee so bad that I thought my brain was gonna melt.

38:19.220 --> 38:20.820
You really sacrificed for your art.

38:20.820 --> 38:21.620
Thank you.

38:21.620 --> 38:23.380
Yeah, and there was no porta-potties,

38:23.380 --> 38:26.820
there was no honey wagons, as we say in Hollywood.

38:26.820 --> 38:30.100
There was just, you know, there was the street corner.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.060
There was a lot of fun looks.

38:31.060 --> 38:32.580
People were like, what are you guys doing?

38:33.300 --> 38:34.340
Imagine how I feel.

38:34.340 --> 38:36.100
I have a fake mustache all the time.

38:36.660 --> 38:36.900
What?

38:36.900 --> 38:37.620
It's fake?

38:38.420 --> 38:40.100
It's a real mustache.

38:40.100 --> 38:44.020
It's just not real hair, if that makes sense.

38:44.020 --> 38:44.660
Oh, cool.

38:44.660 --> 38:47.380
That's a perfectly sensible distinction.

38:47.380 --> 38:50.820
MC Bat Commander, thank you so much for joining us.

38:50.820 --> 38:52.820
Yeah, you guys are on the episode

38:52.820 --> 38:55.540
that just came out and we have a new record coming out

38:55.540 --> 38:58.500
called Kooky Spooky in Stereo, June 20th.

38:58.500 --> 39:01.380
So look for that, look for that, you guys.

39:01.380 --> 39:02.260
It's gonna be great.

39:02.260 --> 39:03.140
Or listen for that.

39:05.780 --> 39:09.220
What's the advice that we're gonna land on with Pigeon Pal?

39:09.220 --> 39:13.700
I feel like you have given every bit of advice on the spectrum

39:13.700 --> 39:16.900
from respect the pigeons to pick them up

39:16.900 --> 39:18.260
and get the scoop off your chest.

39:18.260 --> 39:20.660
I feel like the question asker, Pigeon Pal,

39:20.660 --> 39:22.500
can really just kind of choose their own adventure

39:22.500 --> 39:23.540
as far as that goes.

39:23.540 --> 39:27.700
They could just sort of go with whatever advice suits them.

39:27.700 --> 39:29.540
Thanks, MC Bat Commander, we're even now.

39:29.540 --> 39:30.100
We're square.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.020
Well, I still owe you lunch.

39:32.020 --> 39:35.300
So, and a port-a-potty and a hot dog.

39:35.300 --> 39:36.420
Hopefully not all at once.

39:36.420 --> 39:38.020
That would be an uncomfortable afternoon.

39:38.020 --> 39:39.540
It could be fun, could be fun.

39:40.180 --> 39:43.220
Hey, I got a Yahoo here that was also sent in.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.340
Okay, that was also sent in by several people.

39:47.140 --> 39:50.260
So that's why Yahoo answers user Negotiator who asked,

39:50.260 --> 39:52.900
I think we've done a Negotiator one recently.

39:52.900 --> 39:54.820
Wow, they're big in the scene right now.

39:54.820 --> 40:01.940
They ask, is it possible to discover new large birds still today?

40:03.380 --> 40:05.060
Huh, yeah, sure.

40:05.060 --> 40:07.540
I know that Justin's sort of the bird head among us

40:08.420 --> 40:11.060
because he's seen, well, you've seen most of them,

40:11.060 --> 40:11.940
if not all of them.

40:13.300 --> 40:14.660
And you're always talking about that.

40:14.660 --> 40:15.700
I was very excited about that.

40:15.700 --> 40:17.140
But I guess my question is like,

40:18.180 --> 40:19.780
we got satellites in the sky.

40:19.780 --> 40:20.420
Yeah.

40:20.420 --> 40:21.140
Let's start there.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.100
Are they spreading, are they spreading the coronavirus?

40:24.100 --> 40:26.260
Oh, no one's quite sure about that.

40:27.060 --> 40:28.980
But we got these satellites in the sky

40:29.700 --> 40:31.780
that are definitely spreading coronavirus,

40:31.780 --> 40:33.780
but they're also, they have taken pictures

40:33.780 --> 40:35.620
of every square inch of this planet.

40:35.620 --> 40:37.940
And so we've seen all the land that there is.

40:38.660 --> 40:41.380
You're not gonna, you discover a new island.

40:41.380 --> 40:42.100
You know what I mean?

40:43.060 --> 40:45.860
But what about a large, like a new large bird?

40:45.860 --> 40:47.140
Well, the thing is, it's like,

40:47.140 --> 40:50.500
like this is assuming that all birds look like birds, right?

40:50.500 --> 40:52.340
That you'd see a picture of like, that's a bird.

40:52.340 --> 40:54.740
But what if a bird looked like a bush, right?

40:54.740 --> 40:56.180
And you're like taking a satellite picture

40:56.180 --> 40:57.540
and you're like, that's just a bush.

40:57.540 --> 40:58.100
No, no.

40:58.100 --> 40:58.900
Oh, cool.

40:58.900 --> 40:59.700
That's a bird.

41:00.740 --> 41:03.780
Maybe something weird like this whole time

41:04.820 --> 41:06.420
camels have been birds.

41:06.420 --> 41:06.740
Ooh.

41:06.740 --> 41:08.340
Like we just didn't put it together

41:08.340 --> 41:11.460
because they just don't look in any way like birds

41:11.460 --> 41:13.140
and don't have feathers and don't lay eggs

41:13.140 --> 41:15.460
and don't do bird tricks.

41:15.460 --> 41:17.780
Well, it'd be two birds, isn't it?

41:17.780 --> 41:20.020
Each camel would be two birds.

41:22.340 --> 41:25.620
If we had thought about it for like a fucking second,

41:25.620 --> 41:28.420
we would have realized that all camels are two birds.

41:28.420 --> 41:29.060
And you know what?

41:29.060 --> 41:30.500
Maybe there's just a big bird

41:30.500 --> 41:32.020
that we've all been seeing a lot,

41:32.020 --> 41:33.700
but like taking for granted, right?

41:33.700 --> 41:36.180
Like there is, it's a new species of bird

41:36.180 --> 41:37.620
and we've all seen a bunch of them

41:37.620 --> 41:40.020
and everyone thought definitely someone

41:40.020 --> 41:41.940
like categorized that bird, right?

41:41.940 --> 41:43.540
Catalog that bird, right?

41:43.540 --> 41:46.580
Right, but we've just been taking for granted

41:46.580 --> 41:48.420
that everyone knows that bird, right?

41:48.420 --> 41:50.260
I could have seen, that's a great point, Charles.

41:50.260 --> 41:52.340
I could have seen a new bird many, many times

41:52.340 --> 41:55.140
and it would not have crossed my mind to think like,

41:55.140 --> 41:56.580
hey, I don't know what that one is.

41:56.580 --> 41:58.500
Maybe that means it hasn't been discovered yet.

41:58.500 --> 42:01.300
I thought that whilst on the JoCo cruise last year,

42:01.300 --> 42:04.100
you know, we'd sail past a tiny spit of land

42:04.660 --> 42:05.700
and your thought is like,

42:05.700 --> 42:07.300
definitely someone owes that land,

42:07.300 --> 42:08.580
but what if they don't?

42:08.580 --> 42:10.900
What if I was the first person to see that

42:10.900 --> 42:13.140
and it's full of weird big birds

42:13.140 --> 42:16.100
that I could be riding on or talking to?

42:17.140 --> 42:19.380
And that's the fucking dream, isn't it, man?

42:20.820 --> 42:21.860
Don't get me started.

42:21.860 --> 42:22.340
Just saying.

42:22.980 --> 42:25.860
There's probably a fucking diesel ostrich out there

42:25.860 --> 42:27.380
that I could choke a bow, right?

42:27.380 --> 42:30.100
There's probably like a fucking jacked ostrich

42:30.100 --> 42:32.660
that I could just fucking mount

42:32.660 --> 42:33.860
and ride across the countryside.

42:33.860 --> 42:35.220
I understood what you meant,

42:35.220 --> 42:37.220
but it also sounded like a fun way of saying

42:37.220 --> 42:38.580
you wanted to choke an ostrich.

42:40.740 --> 42:41.620
I mean, if that's part of the-

42:41.620 --> 42:43.780
It's a lot of neck to not want to choke it,

42:43.780 --> 42:44.420
is what I'm saying.

42:44.420 --> 42:46.260
No, we've talked about this for sure.

42:46.820 --> 42:48.260
We've definitely talked about this,

42:48.260 --> 42:49.940
I think maybe in the context of geese,

42:49.940 --> 42:52.420
but ostrich, that ball still plays.

42:53.060 --> 42:57.380
And if the choking is part of this sort of riding process,

42:57.380 --> 43:00.660
then that is a price I'm willing for the ostrich to pay.

43:01.540 --> 43:04.660
I'm just saying that show me eight birds right now

43:04.660 --> 43:07.220
and say which of these isn't cataloged.

43:07.780 --> 43:09.060
I got no fucking clue.

43:09.060 --> 43:12.180
I could go one day without Travis demanding

43:12.180 --> 43:13.460
to see a picture of eight birds.

43:13.460 --> 43:16.420
I'm saying, why has no one shown me these eight birds?

43:16.420 --> 43:18.500
I don't feel like, if eight birds exist,

43:18.500 --> 43:20.260
where's the proof, you know?

43:21.300 --> 43:23.780
Where's the proof?

43:23.780 --> 43:25.460
Wait, you're saying eight birds?

43:25.460 --> 43:27.700
You're saying there's fewer than eight birds?

43:27.700 --> 43:29.460
No, I'm just saying if there's more than eight birds,

43:29.460 --> 43:30.100
I haven't seen them.

43:31.220 --> 43:36.820
I yesterday had a cardinal outside my front door.

43:36.820 --> 43:37.300
That's what?

43:37.300 --> 43:38.500
That.

43:38.500 --> 43:39.140
No, listen.

43:39.140 --> 43:39.460
Okay.

43:41.540 --> 43:43.540
I will list all the birds I've seen.

43:43.540 --> 43:47.700
No, this cardinal would fly in front of my glass door,

43:47.700 --> 43:49.700
kind of poke it with its beak,

43:50.260 --> 43:51.700
and then fly off to the side.

43:52.260 --> 43:55.540
And then 20 seconds later, it would fly back over

43:55.540 --> 43:56.900
and be like, hey, what's going on?

43:57.460 --> 43:59.060
Hey, can I come in?

43:59.060 --> 43:59.860
This is weird.

43:59.860 --> 44:00.340
Okay.

44:00.340 --> 44:02.020
And then fly back off to the side.

44:02.020 --> 44:04.020
This bird did this for 10 minutes.

44:05.060 --> 44:07.060
Guys, I've never seen anything like it,

44:07.060 --> 44:08.820
and I'm not a superstitious person,

44:08.820 --> 44:12.980
but I thought it had to be important for something,

44:12.980 --> 44:15.540
an omen of something.

44:15.540 --> 44:17.140
And I don't know what it meant,

44:17.140 --> 44:22.820
but this cardinal just looked in the door for 10 minutes.

44:22.820 --> 44:23.940
Why was it doing that?

44:24.500 --> 44:26.500
Now, was there a point in there, Justin,

44:26.500 --> 44:28.980
where you thought maybe this bird wants me to follow it?

44:30.420 --> 44:31.860
Okay, that's one option,

44:31.860 --> 44:37.140
that it knew where some sort of treasure or cool plant was.

44:37.140 --> 44:39.780
Okay, according to the very cursory Google search,

44:39.780 --> 44:42.100
apparently there's a lot of symbolism

44:42.100 --> 44:43.860
attached to red cardinal sightings.

44:43.860 --> 44:46.340
The Choctaw people believe that the cardinal's

44:46.340 --> 44:47.620
an omen regarding relationships.

44:47.620 --> 44:49.540
If you're single, it could mean

44:49.540 --> 44:50.980
that your status is about to change.

44:50.980 --> 44:53.140
If your relationship is in trouble,

44:53.140 --> 44:55.460
the cardinal may be a warning that things need to change.

44:55.460 --> 44:56.740
I'm not saying that your relationship

44:56.740 --> 44:58.100
with Sidney is in trouble.

44:58.100 --> 44:58.820
Things are good on that front.

44:58.820 --> 45:01.060
But if you did walk up to her and you're like,

45:01.060 --> 45:06.500
babe, I got a split, saw a badass cardinal outside,

45:06.500 --> 45:08.820
got a split, you know what that means?

45:08.820 --> 45:12.740
No, but at one point Sidney's mom told us

45:12.740 --> 45:15.060
that it was an omen of pregnancy

45:15.060 --> 45:17.940
and my hand turned into a hatchet like T2

45:17.940 --> 45:19.460
and I just chopped the thing in half.

45:19.460 --> 45:20.020
Oh.

45:20.020 --> 45:21.620
So without even thinking about it,

45:21.620 --> 45:23.460
it was insatiable, people.

45:23.460 --> 45:24.820
It was just instinct.

45:25.860 --> 45:27.460
Yeah, there's a lot of us talking about

45:27.460 --> 45:29.060
hurting birds in this episode.

45:29.060 --> 45:31.380
Well, what are they, that's what they deserve.

45:31.380 --> 45:33.300
No, I'm not, I don't mean that.

45:34.020 --> 45:36.100
But it's like, hurtin' birds.

45:36.100 --> 45:37.780
No Justin, I know when you're,

45:37.780 --> 45:39.380
I know when you're being serious

45:39.940 --> 45:42.660
and I know that your hand turned into a hatchet

45:42.660 --> 45:44.180
and you killed a bird with it

45:44.180 --> 45:45.940
and that's fucked up, dude.

45:47.460 --> 45:48.740
I know your joking voice

45:48.740 --> 45:50.180
and I know your serious voice

45:50.180 --> 45:51.860
and that was your serious voice.

45:51.860 --> 45:52.980
Be better, Justin.

45:54.180 --> 45:56.660
I don't condone bullying.

45:56.660 --> 45:59.380
No, only against birds, right?

45:59.380 --> 46:01.940
That's not applicable to this thing.

46:01.940 --> 46:03.700
You can't just say a good thing

46:03.700 --> 46:05.620
to counterbalance the fact that you killed a bird

46:05.620 --> 46:08.340
with your mercury shifting hand.

46:08.340 --> 46:10.260
I'm currently dealing with a dilemma.

46:10.260 --> 46:12.660
Is it okay to vape while in a Zoom class?

46:12.660 --> 46:14.100
Can I get in trouble?

46:14.100 --> 46:16.500
It's not like the professor can get mad at me about it

46:16.500 --> 46:18.260
because I'm doing it in my bedroom

46:18.260 --> 46:20.660
but it still feels like there's something morally wrong

46:20.660 --> 46:23.380
about whipping the jewel out on camera in front of everyone

46:24.260 --> 46:26.500
and if it is okay, how do I go about it?

46:26.500 --> 46:28.100
Should I try to be subtle

46:28.100 --> 46:30.020
or just act like I know what I'm doing?

46:30.020 --> 46:33.140
Am I overthinking this, vape shy in Vermont?

46:33.140 --> 46:35.140
I love that those are the two options.

46:35.140 --> 46:38.900
Should I be subtle or just act like I know what I'm doing?

46:38.900 --> 46:40.100
I'm going to vape.

46:41.220 --> 46:42.260
I will vape.

46:42.260 --> 46:43.220
I will vape.

46:43.860 --> 46:47.140
I might chief it and blow it back into my polo

46:47.140 --> 46:48.180
but I will vape.

46:48.820 --> 46:50.020
It is gonna happen.

46:50.020 --> 46:51.220
Here's a subtle way you could do it.

46:51.220 --> 46:54.500
You could take a bit, wrap it in your fist, right?

46:54.500 --> 46:57.060
So it just looks like you're thinking

46:57.060 --> 46:59.780
and then act like you're taking a drink of water

46:59.780 --> 47:01.860
out of a glass and blow the smoke into there

47:01.860 --> 47:03.860
so it blows out the sides

47:03.860 --> 47:06.180
and then just look at the glass horrified

47:06.820 --> 47:09.060
and then begin to change into a monster.

47:09.060 --> 47:10.660
Okay.

47:10.660 --> 47:15.380
Every day I pray, I wake up and I pray

47:15.380 --> 47:18.180
that it'll be the day I'll see someone vaping through a mask

47:18.820 --> 47:20.340
and I haven't seen it yet.

47:20.340 --> 47:24.580
I just pray to the sweet, sweet Lord above

47:24.580 --> 47:26.420
that one of these days I'm gonna see it

47:26.420 --> 47:29.700
and I drive by the Walmart

47:29.700 --> 47:33.620
just assuming that'll be the spot if I'm gonna see it

47:33.620 --> 47:34.980
but I haven't seen it yet

47:35.940 --> 47:37.620
but I'm still holding out hope.

47:37.620 --> 47:41.380
And you know, the irony is if they remade the movie The Mask today

47:41.380 --> 47:42.820
he would definitely vape.

47:42.820 --> 47:44.500
He would definitely vape.

47:45.140 --> 47:45.700
Vaping.

47:45.700 --> 47:48.820
And then he would say that instead of smoking.

47:48.820 --> 47:53.700
I hate that I had to explain.

47:53.700 --> 47:56.180
I hate that I had to fucking explain that joke

47:56.180 --> 47:58.260
to you two assholes.

47:58.260 --> 48:00.260
V-A-P-E-Y.

48:09.060 --> 48:11.860
I wish they would make another mask today.

48:11.860 --> 48:13.220
I would love that.

48:13.220 --> 48:16.020
That would make me so happy.

48:16.020 --> 48:16.580
Today?

48:17.380 --> 48:18.100
Right now?

48:19.380 --> 48:21.940
Yeah, he can't get close to anybody.

48:26.980 --> 48:29.700
They should remake The Mask shot for shot

48:29.700 --> 48:31.380
but nobody can get within six,

48:31.380 --> 48:34.820
no character can be within six feet of any other character.

48:34.820 --> 48:36.900
He has no respect for social mores

48:36.900 --> 48:39.220
but lots of respect for social distancing.

48:39.220 --> 48:40.580
That's fucking great.

48:40.580 --> 48:43.300
Jim Carrey plays this like nerdy banker

48:43.300 --> 48:45.060
and Cameron Diaz rolls up

48:45.060 --> 48:47.300
and stands six feet away from the desk

48:47.300 --> 48:48.500
as she does her bank business

48:48.500 --> 48:52.180
and he's like, boy, I sure would like to kiss pretty Cameron Diaz

48:52.180 --> 48:54.420
but I can't because of social distancing.

48:54.420 --> 48:56.420
Then he puts on this mask and he's like,

48:56.420 --> 48:58.740
I'm gonna get within six feet of ya.

48:58.740 --> 49:02.020
And you're like, dude, that's too crazy mask.

49:02.020 --> 49:03.460
Somebody stop me.

49:03.460 --> 49:04.500
Not physically.

49:05.140 --> 49:05.860
We're not gonna take risks.

49:05.860 --> 49:12.980
Nobody touch me.

49:12.980 --> 49:13.620
That'd be badass.

49:13.620 --> 49:15.060
P-A-R-T, why?

49:15.060 --> 49:16.100
Because I'm lonely.

49:18.100 --> 49:18.600
Zoom.

49:22.100 --> 49:23.300
Zoom suit riot.

49:25.300 --> 49:25.940
Oh boy.

49:26.500 --> 49:27.220
All right.

49:27.220 --> 49:29.060
Boy, I need to go watch The Mask.

49:30.740 --> 49:34.980
It's an extreme, extremely powerful desire right now.

49:34.980 --> 49:37.620
I'll watch, I'll settle for Son of the Mask, baby.

49:37.620 --> 49:38.340
I don't give a shit.

49:39.140 --> 49:42.580
Like honestly though, don't fuck around with that.

49:45.620 --> 49:48.340
Don't joke about watching Son of Mask

49:48.340 --> 49:50.820
because it's got some scenes in there.

49:50.820 --> 49:52.420
It goes places.

49:52.420 --> 49:55.140
It goes places.

49:55.140 --> 49:57.460
There's an extended urination scene.

49:57.460 --> 49:59.780
There's an extended urination scene.

49:59.780 --> 50:02.740
There's this scene and it's,

50:03.380 --> 50:04.820
I just double checked the length.

50:04.820 --> 50:06.820
On YouTube, it's four and a half minutes long

50:07.380 --> 50:12.580
and it's just the Mask lip syncing to too good to be true.

50:13.140 --> 50:15.460
You're just too good to be true, right?

50:15.460 --> 50:21.540
But he does like a rap version and a country western version

50:21.540 --> 50:25.300
and it is absolutely horrific.

50:25.300 --> 50:28.020
Why did they give the Jamie Kennedy mask hair?

50:28.900 --> 50:30.020
That's all I wanted to say.

50:30.900 --> 50:31.940
And we'll put it to bed there.

50:31.940 --> 50:35.620
I cannot believe how little we talked about this incredibly pure

50:35.620 --> 50:38.660
and beautiful question of how to secretly vape in Zoom calls.

50:39.220 --> 50:40.740
I cannot believe we didn't.

50:40.740 --> 50:44.180
Cause you can't just keep turning your video off

50:45.060 --> 50:46.420
every time you want to rip it.

50:46.420 --> 50:47.700
Cause everyone's gonna,

50:47.700 --> 50:49.460
I feel very, very self-conscious

50:49.460 --> 50:51.940
anytime I have to turn the video off on my thing

50:52.500 --> 50:54.340
because I think people are gonna assume

50:54.340 --> 50:56.740
that I'm fucking cranking a jewel up.

50:57.780 --> 50:59.380
That is what I assume when you do it.

50:59.380 --> 51:02.420
Can you keep pretending to drop things?

51:02.420 --> 51:04.660
Just have a pin on the side of your desk that you keep-

51:04.660 --> 51:05.460
Ah, fuck!

51:05.460 --> 51:06.820
This damn pin again!

51:07.380 --> 51:09.060
Can you pretend like you're on fire?

51:10.340 --> 51:11.860
Maybe your garbage can is on fire

51:11.860 --> 51:14.660
and you keep dipping down like to check in on it.

51:14.660 --> 51:16.500
Like I figured out at this time, guys,

51:16.500 --> 51:17.540
and then there's more smoke.

51:18.100 --> 51:21.460
Can you sit down when the class starts

51:22.180 --> 51:25.220
and have a like a Walgreens prescription bag

51:25.220 --> 51:27.540
that you pull your vape rig out of

51:27.540 --> 51:29.780
and then you can rip it, no questions asked.

51:29.780 --> 51:31.380
If somebody's like, what are you doing?

51:31.380 --> 51:34.100
You'd be like, did you see the prescription bag?

51:34.100 --> 51:35.540
My doctor said I need to.

51:36.820 --> 51:37.700
This is medicine.

51:40.660 --> 51:41.780
And also I should remind you

51:41.780 --> 51:44.580
the safest option is to quit vaping now.

51:44.580 --> 51:45.700
There might be,

51:45.700 --> 51:48.260
we're starting to see some research emerge

51:48.260 --> 51:50.420
about connection between coronavirus

51:50.420 --> 51:54.180
being more severe in people who vape.

51:54.180 --> 51:56.660
So I do want to just put this disclaimer on here

51:56.660 --> 51:58.340
that although we don't really understand

51:58.340 --> 51:59.700
the dangers of vaping,

51:59.700 --> 52:01.460
it's probably best that you stop vaping.

52:01.460 --> 52:03.140
Also, it's just not cool anymore.

52:03.140 --> 52:04.740
No, that's the problem.

52:04.740 --> 52:06.180
It's as cool as it's ever been.

52:06.180 --> 52:07.220
It's still fucking cool.

52:07.940 --> 52:11.060
Now listen, if you don't do Juul

52:11.060 --> 52:14.820
and you do your own rig with your own oils in there,

52:14.820 --> 52:16.100
it's probably fine.

52:17.540 --> 52:20.660
No, actually that's what Griffin has just said

52:20.660 --> 52:22.500
is inaccurate.

52:22.500 --> 52:26.020
Listen, if you're doing it from a big business like Juul,

52:26.020 --> 52:28.660
your health is gonna be affected.

52:28.660 --> 52:32.740
But with your own extremely powerful unregulated rig.

52:35.300 --> 52:37.700
Don't let the government regulate your omes.

52:37.700 --> 52:39.300
You are in control of your own omes.

52:39.300 --> 52:41.140
And if you make the fluid at home,

52:41.700 --> 52:42.660
you know what's going.

52:46.100 --> 52:48.500
If you empty out your sister's fog machine

52:48.500 --> 52:50.260
and dump some apple juice in there

52:50.260 --> 52:52.420
and just go to town vaping it.

52:52.420 --> 52:54.580
I'm not saying you're definitely in the clear,

52:54.580 --> 52:56.740
but you're probably fine.

52:56.740 --> 52:57.940
It's probably fine.

52:59.220 --> 53:00.740
It's organic at least.

53:00.740 --> 53:02.260
It's at least organic.

53:02.820 --> 53:05.300
Organic means things you make yourself, right?

53:05.300 --> 53:06.820
It's organic basically.

53:07.540 --> 53:10.100
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

53:10.100 --> 53:10.980
my brother, my brother and me.

53:10.980 --> 53:12.740
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

53:12.740 --> 53:17.780
We've got some new stickers over at McElroyMerch.com.

53:17.780 --> 53:19.700
Not for sale, Justin's just bragging

53:19.700 --> 53:22.100
about some bad ass stickers we bought.

53:22.100 --> 53:23.780
It's got Squidward.

53:23.780 --> 53:25.380
Here's fucking Lightning McQueen.

53:26.020 --> 53:29.700
I got one, it's Calvin and he's pissing on the coronavirus.

53:30.340 --> 53:32.820
It's Calvin pissing on a smaller Calvin.

53:32.820 --> 53:33.540
It's so cool.

53:33.540 --> 53:35.300
That one's pissing, you get the idea.

53:36.500 --> 53:38.180
But that's at McElroyMerch.com.

53:39.540 --> 53:43.220
I traded some Heathcliff the cat stickers

53:43.220 --> 53:44.740
for some Beyblade stickers.

53:44.740 --> 53:46.900
So that's a major glow up.

53:46.900 --> 53:49.780
I also want to, if you are looking for some,

53:49.780 --> 53:51.300

53:56.260 --> 53:57.060
I think it's real good.

53:57.060 --> 53:57.940
There's Monster Factory.

53:57.940 --> 53:59.700
You sound like a fucking cop.

53:59.700 --> 54:01.220
You say that every time.

54:02.900 --> 54:03.460
Maybe I am.

54:03.460 --> 54:05.300
If you're one of those cool teens

54:05.300 --> 54:07.460
that likes to skateboard and vape drugs,

54:07.460 --> 54:09.140

54:15.460 --> 54:20.500

54:20.500 --> 54:26.660
Oh, I'm this Thursday, the 14th, I believe.

54:26.660 --> 54:30.660
Yes, I'm going to be doing a live stream event

54:30.660 --> 54:31.620
with Janet Varney,

54:32.660 --> 54:35.060
where we're just gonna be funny for a while.

54:35.060 --> 54:37.460
And it's not to like raise money for anything

54:37.460 --> 54:38.500
or anything like that.

54:38.500 --> 54:41.300
It's just a fun time of me and Janet Varney hanging out.

54:41.300 --> 54:46.020

55:17.300 --> 55:21.380
is it safe to flush grapes down the toilet?

I need to get rid of them somehow.
