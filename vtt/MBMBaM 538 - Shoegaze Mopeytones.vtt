00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.640
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:48.640 --> 00:52.640
an advice show from the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.800
I'm your middlest brother, Travis, the middlest brother of McElroy.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.920
And I'm Griffin McElroy. Thanks for listening, folks.

00:59.920 --> 01:04.240
I want to join his- Hey, shut up. I want to talk about my thing.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.400
So fast. So furious.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.640
Really quick. Guys, it's going to blow your mind,

01:10.640 --> 01:13.680
and you're talking about other bullshit instead of the very important thing.

01:13.680 --> 01:17.040
Welcoming our guests to our house. I don't care about them.

01:17.040 --> 01:21.360
Me and Justin have some fucking party snacks. We got some Ritz Crackers,

01:21.360 --> 01:27.280
different savory delights on them, and you just ran in and flying bicycle kicks.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.880
Big bucket of Kool-Aid on them. That's because you guys are living

01:30.880 --> 01:34.080
in the past, and once I tell you what I'm going to tell you about,

01:34.080 --> 01:38.800
you won't remember what it's like before. And it is this.

01:38.800 --> 01:43.040
My friends just announced, big announcement, on the upcoming-

01:43.040 --> 01:45.680
I already hear you laughing. I'm wondering if this is even true.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.840
I'm wondering if you're even excited about what you're saying.

01:47.840 --> 01:53.440
On the, in the upcoming premiere of The Last Man Standing,

01:53.440 --> 01:58.320
the Tim Allen sitcom, there will be a special guest

01:58.320 --> 02:05.280
in which Tim the Toolman Taylor will meet Tim Allen's character in Last Man Standing.

02:05.280 --> 02:10.640
Wait, what? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:10.640 --> 02:14.000
How does the mind boggles? How does he-

02:14.000 --> 02:16.160
First of all, how are they going to film that? Fucking impossible.

02:16.160 --> 02:20.160
You can't. There's no way. Tell me everything.

02:20.160 --> 02:24.880
So, Tim the Toolman Taylor will meet Last Man Standing's Mike Baxter

02:26.240 --> 02:31.840
in the Fox comedy Last Man Standing. I know absolutely nothing about it.

02:31.840 --> 02:36.800
This is just, this is recent news. The episode hasn't aired yet,

02:36.800 --> 02:41.360
so we can only speculate at the implications. Yeah.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.960
And let me also just say, I've watched a lot of TV before.

02:44.960 --> 02:48.800
We made, of course, a hit award-winning television show

02:48.800 --> 02:53.440
called My Brother, My Brother, Me. I didn't know you could just fucking do that.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.200
Yeah. I didn't know you could be like,

02:55.200 --> 02:59.520
enjoy this new episode of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,

02:59.520 --> 03:04.560
where Chandler Bing shows up and hangs out with Matthew Perry.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.280
That would have saved the show. It might have saved it.

03:07.280 --> 03:11.840
Right now, Matthew Perry is listening to this episode and going,

03:11.840 --> 03:15.200
God damn it, why didn't we do that? That would have been real cool.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.360
I think I speak for all of America when I say,

03:17.360 --> 03:20.000
I think I speak for all of America when I say, can they touch?

03:21.040 --> 03:25.200
There's a screenshot, Griffin, accompanying the thing I saw,

03:25.200 --> 03:28.960
where they're shaking hands. No, well, that's the problem.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.360
Is that if they do touch, I feel like they should,

03:32.320 --> 03:35.760
I mean, any number of sort of cataclysmic things.

03:35.760 --> 03:40.640
Oh, wait, sorry. Okay, now we're fucking cooking.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.400
I thought that's what you were getting at here.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.160
If they could touch- Turn down the lights.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.360
I just want a sweet, tender, romantic love scene

03:49.360 --> 03:52.720
between Tim Allen and Tim Allen. Oh, we all want that.

03:52.720 --> 03:56.960
But why stop there? Because Tim Allen circa Santa Claus

03:56.960 --> 03:59.600
could be up in there too. Oh, yeah.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.160
It's a big Tim Allen. Three-way menage a Tim.

04:03.120 --> 04:06.800
That's pure Michigan, baby. And maybe get buzzed up in there.

04:06.800 --> 04:10.480
You didn't stop to listen to me saying that's pure Michigan, baby,

04:10.480 --> 04:13.360
and I'm going to need you to just take a second, okay?

04:13.360 --> 04:17.440
Okay, so let me do it again. That's pure Michigan, baby.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.560
If we can just get buzzed sort of doing commentary,

04:22.560 --> 04:26.320
like, yes, you're stroking his butt.

04:28.320 --> 04:32.800
You're about to, you're putting your wiener near his butt

04:32.800 --> 04:37.040
and beyond. You guys are going to sinfinity and beyond.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.160
That's better. It's pretty good.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.600
Cool, man. Cool. I'll watch that.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.360
No, sorry, Griffin. Tool, man.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.680
Tool, man. Guess what? I'll fucking watch that.

04:47.360 --> 04:53.040
I won't like it. I won't enjoy supporting Mr. Allen's art.

04:53.040 --> 04:57.440
But damn it, he got me in his trap again.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.720
You know what the first thing I thought of when I saw it, Griffin?

05:00.720 --> 05:03.680
Can I say something real quick before we move off the sex thing?

05:03.680 --> 05:07.680
I just want to say that it's not fair that home,

05:07.680 --> 05:09.760
like in Home Improvement, doesn't rhyme with cum,

05:09.760 --> 05:11.520
even though they're spelled the same way,

05:11.520 --> 05:13.600
because I think there'll be a really good thing there.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.560
Yeah, there's something there.

05:14.560 --> 05:15.440
A really good thing.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.080
Maybe the thing would just be cum improvement.

05:18.080 --> 05:21.760
Yeah, but that doesn't, you know what I mean?

05:21.760 --> 05:24.080
I could have said that without any sort of setup

05:24.080 --> 05:25.440
and it wouldn't have really landed.

05:25.440 --> 05:28.160
Home Improvement doesn't, you know what I mean?

05:30.480 --> 05:34.560
So here's the thing, Griffin, when I saw that announcement,

05:34.560 --> 05:41.120
you mentioned- I don't think so, Tim.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.520
Oh, shit.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.000
When I saw that announcement, I knew what we need.

05:46.000 --> 05:46.720
Oh, Jesus Christ.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.760
More power.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.680
It just brings out the biggest fucking symbion

05:49.680 --> 05:51.360
you've ever seen in your entire life.

05:51.360 --> 05:51.840
All right.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.560
So Travis, you've been trying to save for the past four minutes.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.880
And Wilson peeks over and goes, I'm going to finish.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.680
I'm climaxing, neighbor.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.560
When you see an announcement like this, Griffin,

06:02.560 --> 06:04.960
you mentioned not liking Mr. Allen's art.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.320
And all I can think is, it must be that a lot of people don't,

06:08.320 --> 06:09.760
because this isn't the move you make

06:09.760 --> 06:12.320
when your show is doing super good and successful, right?

06:13.520 --> 06:15.120
I am actually pretty sure, Travis,

06:15.120 --> 06:17.200
that Last Man Standing has been canceled,

06:19.040 --> 06:22.240
which it means that they're just kind of going for it.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.000
This is the end.

06:25.440 --> 06:28.240
This is season nine.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.480
How do we let this kind of thing happen?

06:30.480 --> 06:31.600
You know what I mean?

06:31.600 --> 06:33.280
How do we let this sort of thing happen?

06:35.280 --> 06:37.680
Because the show was canceled in 2017.

06:37.680 --> 06:41.040
I thought I was having a weird Bear and St. Bear's thing

06:41.040 --> 06:41.920
where I was like, wait.

06:42.560 --> 06:46.800
We pointed our ire with a far too focused a lens

06:46.800 --> 06:50.240
right toward Young Sheldon, and he deserved it.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.960
But also at the same time, Tim was over there

06:52.960 --> 06:55.440
doing something sneaky in the fucking corner, wasn't he?

06:55.440 --> 06:56.880
Bringing it back without us looking.

06:57.440 --> 06:58.240
What a stinker.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.320
Wait, is Young Sheldon,

07:00.320 --> 07:01.840
the actor who plays Young Sheldon,

07:01.840 --> 07:04.320
also like a right wing asshole?

07:04.320 --> 07:06.000
We're just watching Young Sheldon

07:06.000 --> 07:08.080
waiting for him to make a mistake.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.600
Yeah, because once we do,

07:13.760 --> 07:14.480
Bazinga.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.320
Is there an episode of Young Sheldon

07:18.320 --> 07:19.760
where he finds Bazinga?

07:21.760 --> 07:23.120
Each season he gets one,

07:23.120 --> 07:24.480
in season one it was Baz,

07:25.120 --> 07:27.440
and I hear in season two they're working towards Ing.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.760
Mm-hmm, okay.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.520
So this has been a good intro.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.840
When you mentioned breaking news,

07:33.840 --> 07:35.040
I did think you were gonna talk about

07:35.040 --> 07:36.720
the actual breaking news that just got announced

07:36.720 --> 07:40.480
that they're doing breakdancing at the 2024 Olympics.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.760
Wow, holy shit.

07:41.760 --> 07:45.920
How hard am I legally allowed to watch the Olympics?

07:47.040 --> 07:49.440
How hard am I allowed to watch that happen

07:49.440 --> 07:50.480
and them do that?

07:50.480 --> 07:50.880
Are you fucking kidding me?

07:50.880 --> 07:52.160
They're in pay per view,

07:52.160 --> 07:54.480
but I feel like this is maybe the moment.

07:54.480 --> 07:57.760
I enjoy amateur's breakdancing.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.880
I can't imagine how much I will enjoy

08:00.880 --> 08:03.440
Olympic level professionals.

08:04.240 --> 08:06.880
So I've got, what, probably three and a half years.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.320
Do you think I can get there?

08:11.520 --> 08:12.320
Three and a half years.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.080
Do you think I can get there?

08:14.080 --> 08:15.600
I think you can, Griffin,

08:15.600 --> 08:17.840
but I think it will be like, spoiler alert,

08:17.840 --> 08:21.280
the wrestler where you'll do it and then die.

08:21.280 --> 08:25.200
Wow, man, the spoilers don't come much worse than that,

08:25.200 --> 08:25.840
do they?

08:25.840 --> 08:27.360
Well, here's the thing, Justin.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.280
I've never seen the wrestler.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.880
I just know what happened

08:30.880 --> 08:33.040
because other people have spoiled it for me.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.560
They should call it the Dyer.

08:34.560 --> 08:36.640
Yeah, they should call it the wrestler

08:36.640 --> 08:38.720
and then he dies on it.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.480
But man, wouldn't that be worth it?

08:40.480 --> 08:42.320
Actually, the actual title is wrestler,

08:42.320 --> 08:44.800
parentheses, rip, in parentheses.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.800
And they would lower the fucking,

08:46.800 --> 08:49.520
well, let's be honest, I would be lucky to place,

08:49.520 --> 08:52.880
but so let's say bronze medal just onto my dead-ass body,

08:52.880 --> 08:54.240
slumped over the pedestal.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.800
And you would still be all twisted up

08:56.800 --> 08:58.560
from your last super cool move that you did?

08:58.560 --> 09:00.880
Oh, I would definitely die a fucking

09:00.880 --> 09:03.360
Auntie Anne's pretzel man, for sure.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.760
Well, this is also an advice show, against all odds,

09:08.400 --> 09:09.600
this is also an advice show,

09:09.600 --> 09:13.280
and I'm ready to help people if you guys are,

09:13.280 --> 09:17.200
unless you have any more great Tim Allen sex.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.680
What do you think Tim Allen breakdancing

09:19.680 --> 09:20.800
at the Olympics looks like?

09:20.800 --> 09:22.640
I think it would go a little something like this.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.280
This is gonna get too esoteric.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.080
Maybe.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.880
They're gonna have breakdance at the Olympics,

09:29.440 --> 09:31.920
which means that they're gonna have to get judges

09:32.800 --> 09:35.520
who are like experts in breakdancing,

09:35.520 --> 09:38.560
but aren't at like a competitive level anymore.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.720
And I bet that's gonna be hard to admit to yourself

09:40.720 --> 09:41.840
because this is a new event

09:41.840 --> 09:43.600
and you never got your moment right.

09:43.600 --> 09:47.600
Right, okay, I'm buying a fog machine for my band

09:47.600 --> 09:49.440
when shows happen again.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.560
This is the fucking perfect, supply and demand wise,

09:52.560 --> 09:54.400
I bet fog machines you could get for a song.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.920
Oh, absolutely.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.520
This is a buyer's market for fog machines, 100%.

09:59.520 --> 10:00.240
Why stop there?

10:00.960 --> 10:03.120
Get a disco ball, get one of those things

10:03.120 --> 10:05.520
that's like got all the different lasers inside of it

10:05.520 --> 10:06.720
and kind of spins around.

10:07.520 --> 10:08.240
That's what they're called.

10:08.880 --> 10:10.480
They need a name for those.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.560
They gotta get a name for them though.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.720
So I'm buying a fog machine for when shows happen again.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.280
I'm excited, but whenever I see a band

10:17.280 --> 10:19.600
that has a fog machine, it's always super lame

10:19.600 --> 10:21.200
when the band turns on the fog machine

10:21.200 --> 10:22.960
and it slowly covers the stage.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.520
How do I distract people before the show

10:25.520 --> 10:27.440
when we are dispensing fog?

10:27.440 --> 10:29.760
PS, we are a shoegaze band.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.000
That's from Hazy and Haze.

10:32.000 --> 10:32.960
Thank you, by the way.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.440
These are the details we need, folks.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.400
Yes, yes.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.440
Even if they don't make it into the podcast,

10:39.440 --> 10:41.040
we need this information.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.600
If only we knew what shoegaze was.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.920
Shoegaze, that is the one stumbling block.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.240
Maybe a sort of a sample,

10:48.240 --> 10:49.600
because you know what we're about to do

10:50.160 --> 10:53.040
is draw parallels to somebody we think is shoegaze

10:53.040 --> 10:55.120
and then get mocked mercilessly on,

10:55.120 --> 10:56.240
I was about to say Twitter,

10:56.240 --> 10:57.920
but it'll probably happen on TikTok.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.440
Maybe it's Shoegaze.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.120
Shoegaze.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.440
A Shoegaze band.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.640
I'll tell you what's bad, you guys.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.040
I looked it up after I read this question

11:09.040 --> 11:10.640
and I have since forgotten.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.400
My Bloody Valentine's a big one.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.760
That's the one that keeps coming up.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.320
Is it like when a band has really good shoes

11:16.320 --> 11:17.920
and you can't stop looking at them?

11:17.920 --> 11:19.440
No, I don't think that's probably it.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.280
I think it's just kind of mopey, huh?

11:21.280 --> 11:23.280
Mopey tones, mopey tones.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.160
Mopey tones.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.680
Okay, so your band, the mopey tones.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.040
It's Shoegaze Mopey Tones.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.360
This is my friend, Shoegaze Mopey Tones.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.240
This is why SNL has new casts.

11:34.880 --> 11:35.600
You know what I mean?

11:36.160 --> 11:38.000
Because then you bring in somebody.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.560
I bet Melissa Villasenor knows what shoegaze is.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.960
Yeah, we need some younger McElroy's.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.160
Let's get Charlie in here.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.280
I am working on it.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.920
That's a weird way to put that, Krimit.

11:49.920 --> 11:50.720
Weird way to put that.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.480
I put a baby up in my wife.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.200
What more could I do?

11:53.200 --> 11:54.480
Come on, come on.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.040
Now here's, maybe this is what an opener is for.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.240
You have an opening act.

11:58.240 --> 12:01.280
Oh yeah, make the opener come out to your fucking fog machines.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.920
Weak, impotent, sputtering.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.880
That is such a rough way to do them though, isn't it?

12:08.880 --> 12:09.600
Yeah.

12:09.600 --> 12:16.720
I've worked in theater enough that a little bit of fog

12:16.720 --> 12:18.720
until it warms up, I guess.

12:19.440 --> 12:20.560
No one knows how they work.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.640
How long can you leave a fog machine on?

12:26.640 --> 12:28.320
Can you just have the fog machine going

12:28.320 --> 12:30.160
before the venue even opens?

12:30.800 --> 12:34.400
Well, then you're using up the juice, Krimit.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.400
Yeah, that juice is expensive.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.440
You do not want a roadie rushing out mid-show

12:39.440 --> 12:40.800
to swap the juice.

12:40.800 --> 12:41.840
Yeah, absolutely.

12:41.840 --> 12:42.640
Fucking embarrassing.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.480
You don't want to swap the juice.

12:44.480 --> 12:51.280
Can you put a garbage bag up on the exhaust tip

12:51.280 --> 12:54.720
of the fog machine until that fills with fog

12:55.680 --> 12:57.760
and then you can just take it on stage

12:58.400 --> 13:03.200
and pop it or tear it open to get a bunch of fog all at once.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.320
Just like all at once.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.000
Oh yeah, like that.

13:06.000 --> 13:06.720
That's cool.

13:06.720 --> 13:10.080
Cool, the problem is I know you don't want people

13:10.640 --> 13:14.800
to notice the fog machine and I do understand that,

13:14.800 --> 13:19.600
but they also have to notice a little bit

13:19.600 --> 13:21.920
or they're gonna assume there's a fire, right?

13:22.800 --> 13:26.000
If there's just all of a sudden a bunch of smoke,

13:26.000 --> 13:30.160
you're gonna think, well, there's smoke, there's fire.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.600
You're gonna think that, you know what I mean?

13:31.600 --> 13:32.880
You know what, boys?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.400
I'm going down a trip down memory lane

13:34.400 --> 13:36.400
that it's one of the many, many things from my youth

13:36.400 --> 13:38.640
that I really haven't relitigated since then

13:38.640 --> 13:39.520
because if I would have,

13:39.520 --> 13:41.760
I would have realized how extremely busted it was.

13:42.720 --> 13:46.640
We did the Easter pageant every year

13:46.640 --> 13:51.280
and at that great scene where Jesus kicks open the tomb

13:51.280 --> 13:52.640
and is like, what's up, I'm back,

13:54.080 --> 13:55.360
we had a fog machine for that.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.560
And as far as I can remember,

13:59.440 --> 14:03.360
they only use this one bottle of fog machine juice

14:03.360 --> 14:06.880
for every show and it smelled so strongly

14:06.880 --> 14:10.240
of what its smell was, which was piña colada,

14:10.240 --> 14:14.160
which seems at our Southern Baptist Church.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.480
Here he comes, Christ is King, the redeemer.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.360
He is back and better than ever, baby.

14:19.920 --> 14:26.880
And also some tropical themes happening in your nose.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.880
Celebrate Christ's birth on the beach.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.400
I'm just saying maybe this is why I enjoy piña colada so much

14:32.400 --> 14:35.680
is because I sort of think about them in the same way

14:35.680 --> 14:37.280
I think about the resurrection of Christ.

14:37.280 --> 14:40.000
I drink one of those cold fruity babies on a beach

14:40.720 --> 14:43.840
and I just think about when I rolled that stone away.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.400
Sometimes those can bring me back to life.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.720
This is a fun experience

14:50.720 --> 14:51.920
because what the listeners don't know

14:51.920 --> 14:54.000
is I dropped out for like 30 seconds

14:54.000 --> 14:56.080
because of computer issues and just rejoined

14:56.080 --> 14:59.600
and I have no fucking clue how we got.

14:59.600 --> 15:04.560
The last thing I heard was like pop a big bag full of stuff

15:04.560 --> 15:07.280
to piña coladas, make me think about Jesus.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.400
My brain does that for me sometimes while we're recording

15:10.400 --> 15:11.680
and that's actually pretty nice.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.600
It can be fun, kind of a fun jumping off point.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.200
Do you want a Yahoo, fellas?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.120
I'd love that, Griffin, thank you.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.240
This one's sent in by Graham Roebuck.

15:18.240 --> 15:18.720
Thank you, Graham.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.840
It's Yahoo Answers user Gary the human being who asks.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.840
Wait, how much fog can you get in your mouth at one time?

15:26.640 --> 15:28.560
You talking about ripping mad cotton?

15:28.560 --> 15:30.880
Just like all at once the show starts

15:30.880 --> 15:32.160
and everybody's just like.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.040
I guess it depends on if you want to live

15:35.040 --> 15:37.360
with cool lungs after that

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
because probably the answer would be zero.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.960
It's just juice, Griffin.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.080
It's just juice.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.040
Pretty sure it's toxic.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.880
Okay, so Gary the human being asks,

15:47.760 --> 15:50.960
as long as you never give up, you can't fail?

15:52.080 --> 15:53.760
And then in the additional details,

15:54.880 --> 15:56.080
still time on the clock?

15:56.080 --> 15:58.400
I thought that this is one of the more powerful,

15:58.400 --> 16:02.880
motivational sort of, I guess not speech,

16:02.880 --> 16:07.840
but tagline that if you don't stop trying,

16:08.480 --> 16:09.680
you can't fail.

16:09.680 --> 16:10.240
Fail.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.840
But that's just wildly untrue.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.240
Okay, let's see, let's see.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.560
Okay, Griffin, I'm a boxer, right?

16:16.560 --> 16:18.640
And I've just been knocked out.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.120
Yeah.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.440
They ring the bell and then I stand up and say,

16:21.440 --> 16:22.720
let's keep going.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.280
Yeah.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.560
I'm not done.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.880
I'm not done, I've lost.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.320
You lost, but did you fail?

16:29.120 --> 16:30.560
Yeah, I failed to win.

16:30.560 --> 16:33.520
Yeah, but you don't give up boxing, do you?

16:35.200 --> 16:37.920
I turn in my test in math class.

16:37.920 --> 16:38.420
Yeah.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.560
I've gotten all the answers wrong,

16:40.560 --> 16:42.640
but I just keep writing more numbers.

16:42.640 --> 16:45.280
Yeah, but if you keep working in math,

16:46.080 --> 16:47.680
you didn't fail, did you?

16:47.680 --> 16:48.880
But I failed the test.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.880
You did fail that big test.

16:50.880 --> 16:52.880
You did fail the test, but here's the thing,

16:52.880 --> 16:55.760
you didn't give up, because you keep trying.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.880
You can keep asking, are you sure I failed the test?

16:58.880 --> 17:01.280
And then you could be like, can you check again?

17:01.280 --> 17:03.360
And then you could be like, this is illegal.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.320
The test is illegal.

17:04.320 --> 17:05.920
I don't gotta go to court to prove it.

17:05.920 --> 17:11.600
And then you could lose currently 47 of those court battles.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.520
And then, but you haven't failed.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.240
You didn't fail yet.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.760
You're just still trying.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.240
Is there a yet missing from this sentence?

17:18.800 --> 17:20.080
You haven't failed yet.

17:20.080 --> 17:24.640
Yeah, you haven't failed completely.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.040
I think that you've mostly failed.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.560
There is still one degree to which you have not failed.

17:30.560 --> 17:34.080
I think that the world needs to recalibrate a little bit, frankly.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.440
I've been thinking about this a lot,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
where we've got this whole chip on our shoulders

17:38.000 --> 17:39.600
when it comes to like, well, you didn't give up.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.480
You didn't fail.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.520
And like, you know, if you failed a plan, you plan for it.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.960
Sometimes the most respect I have for someone

17:46.960 --> 17:49.520
is when they realize they're not good at something

17:49.520 --> 17:50.800
and stop doing it.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.000
And they say, maybe I'm gonna try something I am good at.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.600
And they find that thing.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.840
And this comes from someone who was really bad

17:57.840 --> 17:59.440
at wrestling in middle school.

17:59.440 --> 18:02.480
And dad convinced me not to quit the team by saying, quote,

18:02.480 --> 18:06.480
McElroy's don't quit, which is wildly untrue.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.480
Did he say, if you don't quit, you don't fail,

18:08.480 --> 18:10.000
there's still time on the clock?

18:10.800 --> 18:13.920
I think what he said is, if you don't fail,

18:13.920 --> 18:15.200
then you haven't failed.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.720
And if you quit, then I won't have any children

18:18.720 --> 18:20.960
who even pretend to do sports.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.960
Oh God, oh God, please don't quit.

18:22.960 --> 18:23.460
Yeah.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.800
And so what I'm saying is, maybe what we should do

18:26.800 --> 18:28.720
is encourage people to give up more.

18:29.760 --> 18:30.240
This is-

18:30.240 --> 18:32.160
Like, hey, you don't like that thing.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.600
That thing doesn't make you happy.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.960
Stop doing it.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.920
But this is the opposite of this power.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.240
I came here with this powerful Yahoo.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.000
And I was trying to inspire a generation.

18:46.800 --> 18:47.840
But it didn't work.

18:47.840 --> 18:48.480
It didn't work.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.080
I can't remember what the genera-

18:50.080 --> 18:50.580
Z's?

18:51.040 --> 18:52.000
I can't remember what the-

18:52.000 --> 18:52.800
No, we're back around.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.000
We're at AAs now.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.080
I don't think that's accurate.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.440
I think that's true.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.680
These zenies, they don't know how to fail.

19:00.560 --> 19:01.040
We will teach-

19:01.040 --> 19:03.680
Or they know how to fail too comfortably, Griffin.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.280
But they don't give up.

19:06.080 --> 19:06.800
And it's time on the clock.

19:06.800 --> 19:07.920
Maybe they should.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.200
Okay, maybe they should.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.400
Or maybe they shouldn't.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.800
This is what I'm saying is, we're so worried

19:12.800 --> 19:14.240
about debt forgiveness.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.720
What about debt permission?

19:16.720 --> 19:17.840
Okay.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.000
You know, like when someone says,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.240
hey, you owe me a lot of money for your student loans,

19:22.240 --> 19:23.760
you just go, no.

19:23.760 --> 19:24.960
No, forgive me.

19:25.840 --> 19:26.320
How about that?

19:26.320 --> 19:28.160
And they're like, please give me that money.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.200
And you're like, no.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.000
I don't think so.

19:30.000 --> 19:30.320
Actually-

19:31.040 --> 19:31.920
Tough.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.440
I just wonder if-

19:34.800 --> 19:35.280
I don't know.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.960
Can you just say out loud, I forgive you for all your debts?

19:38.960 --> 19:41.360
You want me to say, I forgive you for all your debts?

19:41.360 --> 19:41.840
You said it.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.320
I tricked you, Mr. Mix's Piddlic.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.280
You said your own name.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.960
Now I don't have any more students' debts.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.080
What you can also do, you can trick someone

19:50.080 --> 19:52.800
into your debt cave, and then it's their debt,

19:52.800 --> 19:53.600
and you're free.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.160
Yeah.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.520
I tried this in college, and what I experienced,

19:57.520 --> 20:01.040
and sort of after college with credit card debt,

20:01.040 --> 20:04.240
what I experienced was a series of men

20:04.240 --> 20:07.680
with progressively lower voices calling me

20:07.680 --> 20:10.400
about the money that they would very much enjoy.

20:10.400 --> 20:10.880
Until you-

20:10.880 --> 20:11.520
No, that's fair.

20:11.520 --> 20:15.680
I did have to fill out a series of more and more complicated

20:15.680 --> 20:18.640
paperwork explaining to people how I didn't have money

20:18.640 --> 20:20.880
to give them, and it wasn't just that I didn't want

20:20.880 --> 20:22.000
to give them that money.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.560
It's that I physically did not have it,

20:24.560 --> 20:27.440
and any amount of money they asked me for,

20:27.440 --> 20:28.640
I wouldn't be able to give them.

20:28.640 --> 20:32.240
One time I filled out a piece of paper that explained

20:32.240 --> 20:34.880
where all of my monthly income went,

20:34.880 --> 20:38.480
and I fudged it to not show being in debt,

20:39.040 --> 20:40.640
and made it seem like at the end of the month

20:40.640 --> 20:45.280
I had $5 surplus, and they wrote back and told me

20:45.280 --> 20:48.400
that I owed them $275 a month,

20:49.040 --> 20:51.680
and I then contacted them and said,

20:51.680 --> 20:53.920
hey, this seems like a bad system.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.440
You've seen the numbers.

20:55.440 --> 20:56.640
I showed you.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.240
We crunched them together.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.440
I showed you the math.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.760
I was very detailed, and I said, I even,

21:01.760 --> 21:03.920
I'm going to be honest, lied to make it seem

21:03.920 --> 21:05.440
like I had more money than I did,

21:05.440 --> 21:07.040
and they said, oh, no, no, no.

21:07.040 --> 21:07.840
You don't need to do that.

21:07.840 --> 21:08.880
Just show the negative.

21:08.880 --> 21:13.040
We expect there to be a negative, and I said, okay,

21:13.040 --> 21:14.560
so then I did the actual math,

21:14.560 --> 21:17.600
and they lowered my expected payment to $150 a month.

21:17.600 --> 21:21.040
Okay, so now that they know you have negative money,

21:21.040 --> 21:22.960
now they want a sensible 150.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.360
Yes, so what I'm saying is,

21:25.360 --> 21:27.760
maybe everybody should stop paying people money.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.320
Okay.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.840
We're all just going to stop.

21:29.840 --> 21:30.160
Yeah.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.680
But if we can't-

21:31.680 --> 21:34.080
They can't collect on all of us at once.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.200
But here's the problem.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.280
Here's the problem, and this is maybe,

21:37.280 --> 21:39.600
God, I'm thinking about it, I definitely just inspired

21:39.600 --> 21:41.360
a generation with this thing from Yahoo,

21:41.920 --> 21:46.480
but to use your example, the debt collectors heard it.

21:46.480 --> 21:47.680
And the debt collectors heard,

21:47.680 --> 21:49.520
as long as you never give up, you can't fail.

21:49.520 --> 21:53.520
And they're like, I can't fail to get Travis's negative $200.

21:54.560 --> 21:55.040
Because if I do-

21:55.040 --> 21:56.000
Oh, they can try.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.320
If I give up, then I failed at it.

21:58.320 --> 22:00.240
There's still time on the clock.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.520
They're still trying too.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.800
Well, okay, then I know how to fix that.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.320
Debt collectors, if you're listening,

22:06.320 --> 22:07.520
and I assume you are,

22:07.520 --> 22:10.880
you can still collect debt from each other.

22:10.880 --> 22:12.400
Okay, yeah.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.440
You can go live in a little debt collector society

22:15.440 --> 22:18.480
where every debt is just passed from one to another

22:18.480 --> 22:20.640
and no actual money is ever exchanged.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.120
Hey, let's try something else too, okay?

22:23.120 --> 22:24.080
Okay, yeah.

22:24.080 --> 22:25.600
Everyone listening to this,

22:26.320 --> 22:28.720
everybody currently under the power of my voice,

22:30.000 --> 22:31.600
I forgive your debt.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.760
Wow, you-

22:33.760 --> 22:38.080
You, listen, you did nothing wrong.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.280
You needed the money.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.080
You got it.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.040
Then you didn't have it to give it back to them.

22:43.040 --> 22:45.120
I forgive you.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.680
Do you forget the debt?

22:48.320 --> 22:49.360
Oh, man.

22:50.160 --> 22:50.800
Yeah.

22:50.800 --> 22:51.300
No.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.960
I'll never, I'll never.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.400
I forgive your debt.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.360
Go fly free.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.280
But I'm watching.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.440
I'll be watching.

23:01.440 --> 23:04.080
Would you guys like another question?

23:04.080 --> 23:04.580
Please.

23:05.040 --> 23:05.540
Okay.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.200
Since COVID, my mom has been-

23:09.200 --> 23:10.080
Why COVID?

23:10.640 --> 23:11.040
What?

23:11.040 --> 23:12.640
Oh, it's a disease.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.440
Oh, my mom has been spending lots of time

23:15.440 --> 23:18.480
writing within the paranormal romance genre.

23:19.600 --> 23:24.000
Spooky sex, as some prefer.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.040
Unbeknownst to her,

23:25.040 --> 23:27.360
I have been doing precisely the same thing,

23:27.360 --> 23:30.000
except instead of a trilogy of original YA novels,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.280
I've been working on a well-received anthology series of fan fiction.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.440
When she describes her plots to me,

23:35.440 --> 23:37.440
I often find plenty of interesting parallels

23:37.440 --> 23:38.960
between my stories and hers.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.080
I want to discuss them,

23:40.080 --> 23:42.400
but I know she assumes all fan fiction

23:42.400 --> 23:45.120
is inherently poorly written and or pornographic.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.120
How can I talk to her about our respective sets

23:47.120 --> 23:48.720
of ghost whispering lovebirds

23:48.720 --> 23:51.600
without admitting to such a taboo hobby?

23:51.600 --> 23:54.880
That's from Sexy Seance in Central Florida.

23:54.880 --> 23:58.400
So you are worried that your mother,

23:58.400 --> 24:02.960
who is also writing paranormal sex stories-

24:02.960 --> 24:03.520
It's OC.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.360
She's writing ghost sex stories.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.440
She's going to look down on your fucking

24:07.440 --> 24:09.520
My Hero Academia slash pick.

24:09.520 --> 24:10.960
Come on, damn.

24:11.680 --> 24:14.560
Their mom is working with OC's,

24:14.560 --> 24:16.480
original characters, original content.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.680
Well, but nothing's original anymore, Griffin.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.200
Shakespeare did it all, you know what I mean?

24:23.200 --> 24:23.680
Thank you.

24:24.240 --> 24:27.600
So Shakespeare had all kinds of ghost sex up in there.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.240
You know what I mean?

24:28.240 --> 24:29.360
So like, it ain't new.

24:29.360 --> 24:29.840
That's fine.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.040
I'll never forget that one scene

24:31.040 --> 24:33.680
where it's Laertes slash old Hamlet.

24:33.680 --> 24:33.920
Yeah.

24:33.920 --> 24:34.640
You know what I mean?

24:34.640 --> 24:37.360
I guess so, but if you got one where it's like,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.560
here's fucking, here's the Grinch,

24:40.560 --> 24:41.920
and he's going to do it,

24:41.920 --> 24:44.720
you can't be like, is there anything new anymore?

24:45.600 --> 24:47.680
Have you been reading mine, Griffin?

24:47.680 --> 24:48.240
That's mine.

24:48.240 --> 24:48.720
I've been reading-

24:48.720 --> 24:50.960
My Grinch, Grinch slash Grinch,

24:50.960 --> 24:53.280
when it's the Grinch from the animated one

24:53.280 --> 24:55.200
has sex with Jim Carrey's The Grinch.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.160
Fantastic stuff.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.600
And also the tool man's there.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.640
Fantastic stuff.

24:58.640 --> 24:59.440
He's got to be there.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.880
He's become like the observer.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.400
Yes, indeed.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.440
He's always there.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.160
God, this is, can I say something?

25:06.960 --> 25:08.080
This is kind of cute.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.160
It's kind of cute.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.200
Yeah, it's kind of cute.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.640
Like, it's going to be good.

25:12.640 --> 25:15.440
And it's going to be like a good commercial for,

25:16.720 --> 25:18.400
I don't know, the paper that it's-

25:18.400 --> 25:18.880
McDonald's?

25:18.880 --> 25:22.720
McDonald's, where you guys show each other your fictions

25:22.720 --> 25:26.320
and you both go, ah, the best part of wake-

25:26.320 --> 25:27.840
I don't know why coffee is there.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.040
Your friend coffee is there.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.200
We can get anything in there.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.880
This would make a plot for a movie

25:32.880 --> 25:35.200
and you can call it Freaky Friday.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.120
Yeah, now we would have to do a lot of press, Trav,

25:41.120 --> 25:43.840
for that one to just sort of get it out there

25:43.840 --> 25:45.600
to get our messaging out there

25:45.600 --> 25:47.120
that you have to say freaky

25:47.920 --> 25:50.240
in a way that lets people know it's not that freaky.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.080
You can do that with font, Griffin.

25:52.720 --> 25:53.600
Describe that.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.640
Is it just italics?

25:54.640 --> 25:57.920
Well, there is some slant to it, yes.

25:57.920 --> 25:58.400
Okay.

25:58.400 --> 26:01.440
But there is also, clearly it's emphasized

26:01.440 --> 26:03.520
and maybe a little sexual.

26:04.640 --> 26:05.040
Just share-

26:05.040 --> 26:07.200
The letters themselves are some lilfs.

26:09.280 --> 26:10.240
Jeez, man.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.760
Some nice squishy holes in the G.

26:13.760 --> 26:15.120
Oh, yeah.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.000
Oh, yeah.

26:16.000 --> 26:16.720
Listen.

26:16.720 --> 26:19.760
Now we got to go through the alphabet

26:19.760 --> 26:22.320
picking out the letters you can have sex with.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.000
We're just, you know,

26:24.000 --> 26:27.120
you're, God, you wanna do something disgusting?

26:27.120 --> 26:28.800
We've done that with numbers.

26:28.800 --> 26:29.760
This is vulgar.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.280
I don't enjoy this.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.960
We have, you're remembering.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.400
We can't, yeah, listen,

26:34.400 --> 26:36.080
all the different Arabic characters

26:36.080 --> 26:37.040
are just really horny.

26:38.080 --> 26:41.040
You know, every genre and sub-genre

26:41.040 --> 26:44.000
and type of new media is looked down upon

26:44.000 --> 26:46.160
by its forebearers

26:46.160 --> 26:49.680
until something comes along that is irrefutable.

26:49.680 --> 26:51.520
And maybe your slash fiction is that.

26:51.520 --> 26:55.680
At first the world looked down its nose at,

26:55.680 --> 26:56.560
you know, the novel

26:56.560 --> 27:00.000
and then here comes fucking Pilgrim's Progress

27:00.000 --> 27:01.040
or something, you know what I mean?

27:01.040 --> 27:02.320
Like an old novel or something

27:02.320 --> 27:04.320
that's like these are legit.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.400
Very sexy book, Pilgrim's Progress.

27:07.760 --> 27:11.840
Let your mom see your stories.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.360
I think, honestly,

27:13.360 --> 27:15.040
I know that even if they look down,

27:15.040 --> 27:17.760
your mom looks down at that kind of work a little bit,

27:17.760 --> 27:19.520
I think if you are the one doing it,

27:19.520 --> 27:21.840
their precious child,

27:21.840 --> 27:24.720
I think that they're gonna be supportive of you

27:25.600 --> 27:26.640
and they're gonna turn it around.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.960
And if you wait too long

27:28.960 --> 27:31.600
and the stories are too similar,

27:32.640 --> 27:34.400
your mom is gonna start feeling

27:34.400 --> 27:36.400
like maybe you're being a little sus

27:36.400 --> 27:38.080
when she finds out later,

27:38.080 --> 27:39.040
oh, what's that?

27:39.040 --> 27:40.320
You've been cribbing.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.000
I had the two-date ghost

27:42.000 --> 27:43.600
and you put that in your story too.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.640
And she's not gonna believe that it's a holy,

27:46.640 --> 27:47.760
you know, it's just an invention

27:47.760 --> 27:49.920
of your third eye.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.840
Yeah, a poke hergeist?

27:54.240 --> 27:55.120
I'm thinking about it.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.760
Why you give back seconds upon it?

27:57.760 --> 28:00.240
Sexorcist is fucking great, Trav.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.200
Congratulations.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.800
Oh, there's a medal.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.080
Oh, it's floating down from the ceiling.

28:06.080 --> 28:09.040
Yeah, it's being handed to you by Jad Appenbron.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.560
It's bringing you this medal.

28:10.560 --> 28:11.120
I did it.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.720
I won podcasting.

28:12.720 --> 28:13.520
You did it.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.040
Oh, there's a ghost of fucking-

28:15.040 --> 28:16.560
Oh, and here's Roman Morris

28:16.560 --> 28:17.920
with a bouquet of flowers.

28:18.880 --> 28:19.760
That's so nice.

28:19.760 --> 28:22.160
And Joe Rogan's at his house, I guess.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.600
I don't know what he's doing right now.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.720
Well, he's the one I beat.

28:25.680 --> 28:27.040
Let's take a break

28:27.040 --> 28:29.120
and go to the Money Zone very quickly.

28:40.160 --> 28:40.960
Listen, real quick.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.240
I don't have a lot of time.

28:42.240 --> 28:43.520
Are you paying attention?

28:43.520 --> 28:44.400
They're coming.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.200
We need to hurry.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.400
This holiday season,

28:46.400 --> 28:48.560
more people will be mailing stuff than ever before.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.440
That means the post office is gonna be busy, okay?

28:51.440 --> 28:53.360
Stamps.com brings the post office

28:53.360 --> 28:55.600
and now UPS shipping right to your computer.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.600
Are you listening, sheeple?

28:57.600 --> 28:59.120
Simply use your computer

28:59.120 --> 29:02.240
to print official US postage 24-7

Ah, they got me!

29:57.760 --> 30:02.560
I wish we could, I wish.

30:02.560 --> 30:05.520
You know, those conspiracy podcasts

30:05.520 --> 30:09.600
are obviously detrimental to the fabric of society,

30:09.600 --> 30:11.280
but man, I bet it'd be fun.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.440
I bet that's a fun set to work on.

30:13.440 --> 30:17.440
Yeah, it'd be a fun space, fun space to play in.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.360
Speaking of space, Squarespace.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.720
I'm not gonna do both of them.

30:22.720 --> 30:23.920
Yeah, let me try it

30:23.920 --> 30:25.680
and I'll try to do what Travis did,

30:25.680 --> 30:27.360
like his character, like conspiracy guy.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.800
Okay, do it, do it, do it.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.400
Oh man, the internet.

30:30.960 --> 30:34.080
The internet, everybody's watching you on it

30:34.080 --> 30:35.360
and tracking your every move.

30:35.360 --> 30:40.640
Vaccines, man.

30:42.320 --> 30:44.320
Wait, were you drinking vaccines?

30:44.320 --> 30:44.960
Yeah.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.000
That's what I got.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Yeah, it kind of sounded like you were just slaking

30:48.000 --> 30:49.760
your thirst with some frosted vaccines.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.680
I was trying to make like a bong noise,

30:51.680 --> 30:53.520
but then I do like better.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.680
Yeah, so you don't need government vaccines

30:55.680 --> 30:58.400
because of the stuff in them,

30:58.400 --> 30:59.600
but my vaccines are good.

30:59.600 --> 31:03.040
You drink them and I mix them in with some Danimals.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.640
You're gonna go nuts for it

31:04.640 --> 31:06.960
and I'm selling these on my website

31:06.960 --> 31:08.720
I made with Squarespace

31:08.720 --> 31:12.000
because Squarespace lets you make a beautiful website

31:12.000 --> 31:14.960
and it's easy and you can showcase your work

31:14.960 --> 31:18.160
or sell products like vaccine-infused Danimals

31:19.360 --> 31:20.480
or services of all kinds.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.400
You can promote your physical or online business

31:22.400 --> 31:23.200
and they give you a bunch of-

31:23.200 --> 31:25.520
Now, Griffin, just one quick note, if I may.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.680
Your conspiracy theorist character

31:27.680 --> 31:29.840
is kind of drifting into a very pleasant

31:29.840 --> 31:30.800
Squarespace spokesperson.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.320
I'm enjoying my time with him.

31:32.320 --> 31:36.080
Oh, okay, I'll try and take it back. Beautiful, customizable templates

31:36.080 --> 31:38.240
created by world-class designers.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.120
Whose world?

31:40.800 --> 31:42.080
Who's Griffin's world?

31:42.720 --> 31:45.680
Not my, maybe my world.

31:45.680 --> 31:48.000
Everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box

31:48.000 --> 31:50.880
if you're silly enough to still have a phone

31:50.880 --> 31:54.400
with a screen on it where they track you and pictures.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.520
And it's got free and secure hosting.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.360
I don't know if they do dark web stuff,

31:59.360 --> 32:01.600
but I think I like that maybe.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.320
And there's nothing to patch or upgrade, ever.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.040
And go to Squ-

32:05.040 --> 32:05.600
Never?

32:05.600 --> 32:06.960
Never, you don't.

32:06.960 --> 32:09.120
It's like a good machete.

32:26.560 --> 32:27.920
Okay, what are you doing an ad for?

32:29.600 --> 32:31.040
We don't have any more.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.760
I wanna do one too with this guy.

32:33.760 --> 32:34.320
Okay, what are you gonna talk about?

32:34.320 --> 32:36.400
Everybody's having such a good time.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.800
But you need to talk about a product though.

32:38.800 --> 32:39.920
Well, okay.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.560
Are you guys giving to charity?

32:46.800 --> 32:49.200
You're becoming like Doc Brown.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.320
That's good.

32:50.320 --> 32:53.520
Everybody support your local bookstores.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.640
Buy local produce.

32:56.640 --> 32:57.680
Farm to table, Marty.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.120
Well, hello, I'm Renee Colvert.

33:01.120 --> 33:02.560
Hi, I'm Alexis Preston.

33:02.560 --> 33:04.400
And we are the host of Can I Pet Your Dog?

33:04.400 --> 33:05.760
And we got breaking news.

33:05.760 --> 33:08.560
We got an expose that all the beans have been spilled

33:08.560 --> 33:11.280
via an Apple podcast review that said

33:11.280 --> 33:14.240
this show isn't well researched.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.280
Well, yeah, no duh.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.240
Of course, it's not.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.960
Not since the day we started has it been well researched.

33:18.960 --> 33:19.760
Guessing?

33:19.760 --> 33:20.560
Guessing?

33:20.560 --> 33:23.680
Not since the day we started has it been well researched.

33:23.680 --> 33:26.480
Guessing and anthropomorphizing dogs is what we do.

33:26.480 --> 33:30.000
The Can I Pet Your Dog promise is that we will never do more

33:30.000 --> 33:32.080
than 10 seconds of research before telling you

33:32.080 --> 33:33.840
excitedly about any dog we see.

33:33.840 --> 33:38.000
I'm gonna come at you with top 10 enthusiasm, minimal facts.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.160
We're here for a good time, not an educated time.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.560
So if you love dogs and you don't love research,

33:42.560 --> 33:43.520
well, you know what?

33:43.520 --> 33:45.920
Come on in to Can I Pet Your Dog podcast

33:45.920 --> 33:47.760
every Tuesday on Maximum Fun Network.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.520
Can I Pet Your Dog?

33:49.520 --> 33:51.600
I would like to do the Munch Squad bit though.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.100
Okay.

33:59.440 --> 34:03.600
I want a Munch Squad.

34:03.600 --> 34:09.520
I want to Munch Squad.

34:09.520 --> 34:10.800
Do you guys know what?

34:12.240 --> 34:14.160
Do you guys know what the Munch Squad is about this week?

34:14.160 --> 34:14.400
Yes.

34:15.040 --> 34:15.520
Okay.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.080
Travis, do you?

34:16.080 --> 34:16.320
Yes.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.040
Yes.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.240
No, I don't want to guess.

34:18.240 --> 34:19.680
I just want to know if you know.

34:19.680 --> 34:20.480
Yeah.

34:20.480 --> 34:20.980
Okay.

34:21.680 --> 34:24.000
Well, let's just enjoy this together then.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.640
This is just going to take a minute and 12 seconds,

34:26.640 --> 34:27.840
but I think it is well earned.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.200
Could I have silence from my brothers, please?

34:29.200 --> 34:29.680
Here we go.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.280
What the hell are you doing?

34:33.280 --> 34:35.360
A lifetime original mini movie.

34:35.360 --> 34:38.640
You don't answer my proposal and now you're not answering my call.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.040
I think I'm falling for the new chef.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.720
Jessica is falling for Harlan.

34:44.720 --> 34:46.640
The cook?

34:46.640 --> 34:48.320
Leave Jessica alone and skip town.

34:48.960 --> 34:51.200
He has a secret recipe that's going to change the world.

34:51.200 --> 34:53.280
Harlan claims to have some secret recipe.

34:53.280 --> 34:54.400
A secret recipe?

34:54.400 --> 34:55.600
Please spare me.

34:55.600 --> 34:56.720
We all have our secrets.

34:58.320 --> 34:59.760
If you marry my daughter,

34:59.760 --> 35:02.400
I promise there'll be more long weekends in your future.

35:03.360 --> 35:04.880
Mom, I have to tell you something.

35:05.600 --> 35:06.960
We have a problem.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.240
Secrets out, chicken man.

35:08.880 --> 35:09.840
I'll take care of this.

35:09.840 --> 35:12.080
You're ruining everything!

35:12.080 --> 35:13.200
Just kill him already!

35:13.200 --> 35:14.400
Who the hell are you?

35:14.960 --> 35:16.720
Harlan Sanders, the new chef.

35:17.280 --> 35:21.680
Mario Lopez is Colonel Sanders in a recipe for seduction.

35:21.680 --> 35:25.360
Premieres December 13th at noon only on Lifetime.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.160
Presented by Kentucky Fried Chicken.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.480
But like, what if it's good though?

35:32.480 --> 35:36.400
What if it's like really, really like Oscar contender good?

35:36.400 --> 35:37.440
Sexual, you know what I mean?

35:37.440 --> 35:41.760
I don't think we can jump right to the what if it's good take, Griffin.

35:41.760 --> 35:45.040
There's so many other things I think we need to get out of the way first.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.800
The one that I want to touch on is there at the end

35:48.800 --> 35:52.720
when they felt it necessary to clarify that it was sponsored by Kentucky Fried Chicken.

35:52.720 --> 35:53.520
Yes, thank you.

35:53.520 --> 35:55.280
I was about to highlight that.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.600
What a wild world it would be if it was like,

35:58.560 --> 36:01.760
unofficial, not approved or endorsed in any way.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.280
Inspired by true events.

36:04.080 --> 36:09.200
Currently impending legal action from Kentucky Fried Chicken.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.360
There's fucking secrets out, chicken man.

36:11.360 --> 36:14.320
Mario Lopez is just crazy about these buckets.

36:14.320 --> 36:16.480
So he's funding it himself.

36:17.760 --> 36:21.760
I would also like to point out that prime debut slide.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.800
Yeah, noon, noon, classic.

36:25.600 --> 36:26.720
So here's the press release.

36:26.720 --> 36:30.080
Kentucky Fried Chicken and Lifetime are teaming up to bring consumers

36:30.080 --> 36:33.200
the perfect distraction from all things 2020.

36:33.200 --> 36:37.680
The holiday lifetime original mini movie, a recipe for seduction.

36:37.680 --> 36:41.600
Featuring veteran actor and star of Lifetime's Feliz Navidad,

36:42.160 --> 36:45.920
Mario Lopez as Colonel Harlan Sanders.

36:45.920 --> 36:47.040
The first of its kind.

36:47.760 --> 36:50.400
Let's fucking hope so.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.640
Lifetime original mini movie.

36:52.640 --> 36:57.280
It's full of mystery, suspense, deception, foul play.

36:57.280 --> 37:00.800
And at the heart of it all, love and fried chicken.

37:00.800 --> 37:01.120
Huh.

37:01.680 --> 37:06.160
To enhance the viewing experience of deep fried holiday romance,

37:06.160 --> 37:09.840
consumers can order KFC on Uber Eats for delivery

37:09.840 --> 37:14.480
and get six free extra crispy tenders with a $20 purchase or more.

37:14.480 --> 37:18.880
While enjoying the delicious taste of the Colonel's secret 11 herbs and spices,

37:18.880 --> 37:22.320
viewers can share in all the drama of this steamy holiday love affair

37:22.320 --> 37:25.920
as they watch a young heiress contend with the affections of a suitor

37:25.920 --> 37:27.280
handpicked by her mother.

37:27.280 --> 37:32.400
Now it does beg the question, I've just spent $20 at KFC

37:32.400 --> 37:36.240
and I've gotten six free extra tenders.

37:36.240 --> 37:39.280
How much of this can I eat in a 15 minute film?

37:39.280 --> 37:43.040
Because I am already dreading that experience.

37:44.800 --> 37:49.200
When a handsome young chef with a secret fried chicken recipe and a dream arrives,

37:49.200 --> 37:54.240
he sets in motion a series of events that unravel the mother's devious plans.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.800
That's the whole movie then, huh?

37:56.800 --> 37:58.240
Yeah, that's the whole thing.

37:58.240 --> 38:01.200
Quote, we're no stranger to heating things up for the holidays,

38:01.200 --> 38:02.560
just like our famous...

38:04.080 --> 38:05.840
How do you think this ends?

38:06.400 --> 38:08.000
Fried chicken meals?

38:08.000 --> 38:09.520
An interesting guess.

38:09.520 --> 38:10.400
Travis, do you have a guess?

38:11.280 --> 38:12.400
Spices and flavors?

38:13.040 --> 38:14.800
Just like our famous fried chicken.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.280
Scented fire log.

38:17.920 --> 38:23.280
But let's face it, we could all use a little distraction this holiday season.

38:23.280 --> 38:25.120
Fuck it, they got it, folks!

38:25.120 --> 38:25.360
Yeah.

38:25.360 --> 38:28.000
They got it at the buzzer!

38:28.000 --> 38:30.240
At the buzzer!

38:30.240 --> 38:35.760
COVID's been hard, so we put a fake mustache and goatee on Macy Slater

38:35.760 --> 38:37.600
and we're just fucking going for it.

38:39.040 --> 38:41.040
Because this'll do it, right?

38:41.600 --> 38:42.800
Will this do it?

38:42.800 --> 38:43.920
KFC Slater.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.960
Why not fill some of your...

38:48.960 --> 38:50.960
Oh man, it's just right here.

38:50.960 --> 38:54.160
Let's face it, we could all use a little distraction this holiday season.

38:54.160 --> 38:57.360
So why not fill some of your time at home?

38:58.480 --> 38:58.800
I mean...

38:58.800 --> 39:01.840
But Grandpapa, what was 2020 like?

39:01.840 --> 39:03.200
Well, it wasn't all bad.

39:04.400 --> 39:08.800
There was, right there at the end, there was a real buzzer beater of a Brideslot.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.800
I'll be straight with you, Bryson.

39:10.800 --> 39:13.680
It was mondo fucking boring.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.320
But then my boy KFC Slater rolled in.

39:17.920 --> 39:21.440
We were saved at the end of the year by President Lopez.

39:21.440 --> 39:25.120
President Lopez, well, he was just Mario to us back then.

39:26.480 --> 39:27.040
But you know what?

39:27.040 --> 39:31.600
I can track it all back to that one day, December 13th at noon,

39:31.600 --> 39:33.200
when the whole world changed.

39:34.400 --> 39:38.320
There was, of course, BRS before Recipe for Seduction,

39:38.320 --> 39:41.600
and of course, ARS after Recipe for Seduction.

39:41.600 --> 39:45.840
Now pass me the KFC Bible and I'll tell you more.

39:45.840 --> 39:53.520
A Recipe for Seduction is Lifetime and KFC's first ever branded custom midform content.

39:53.520 --> 39:54.080
Oh!

39:54.080 --> 39:57.520
The Lifetime original movie is a playful addition to, well, I mean, you get it.

39:57.520 --> 40:02.000
Yeah, once you get all businessy, it's like, ugh, can we just have fun here?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.280
It is a good question, though.

40:04.480 --> 40:08.960
What will you do for the other 15 minutes, Lifetime?

40:08.960 --> 40:09.680
What is it?

40:09.680 --> 40:11.680
This is the first 15 minute thing you've made.

40:11.680 --> 40:14.560
What are you gonna throw on a fucking episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force?

40:14.560 --> 40:16.080
That's a good question.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.600
What are you doing after this?

40:17.600 --> 40:22.800
After its linear premiere, a Recipe for Seduction will be unbound from reality.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.760
Continue to be available throughout the holiday season

40:27.760 --> 40:31.440
on mylifetime.com forward slash Christmas hyphen movies,

40:31.440 --> 40:34.800
all Lifetime apps and VOD platforms.

40:34.800 --> 40:40.480
Quote, Lifetime is the perfect holiday home to bring this spicy, unexpected tale to life,

40:40.480 --> 40:47.920
said David DeSocio-Path, I'm assuming, UVP of ad sales and marketing partnerships,

40:47.920 --> 40:53.280
A&E Networks, through a terrific cast and with a wink to the unique sensibilities

40:53.280 --> 40:55.040
celebrated in Lifetime movies.

40:55.040 --> 40:58.800
This co-production spotlights, can we just have something nice?

40:58.800 --> 41:00.480
I mean, can we just have something nice?

41:00.480 --> 41:03.360
That we did a KFC Lifetime movie.

41:03.360 --> 41:04.000
Just say that!

41:04.000 --> 41:05.040
It's fun!

41:05.040 --> 41:08.960
We've blended the beloved sensibilities of the Lifetime-

41:08.960 --> 41:11.680
But this is dumb as shit and you'll like it.

41:11.680 --> 41:14.880
You'll like it for 15 minutes and you'll forget about it.

41:14.880 --> 41:15.680
We made a chicken log!

41:15.680 --> 41:18.240
And you'll pretend like you didn't like it and you'll be all ironic about it,

41:18.240 --> 41:21.840
but you were sincerely happy we did it and you can admit that here.

41:21.840 --> 41:22.800
You know us.

41:22.800 --> 41:26.000
You know us, what we do with our chicken log.

41:26.000 --> 41:26.560
You know what this is.

41:26.560 --> 41:29.200
Just don't make it into a fucking business thing.

41:29.200 --> 41:32.000
You're not gonna sell any more chicken because of this.

41:32.000 --> 41:32.720
This is the problem.

41:32.720 --> 41:33.040
Just let's have fun.

41:33.040 --> 41:37.440
It's a nice thing because apparently it's been a challenging year according to this press release.

41:37.440 --> 41:39.280
It's been a hard year for a lot of us.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.160
Apparently.

41:40.160 --> 41:44.080
Here's the thing is that kind of brand explanation,

41:44.080 --> 41:46.800
that's where you get into too self-aware where I'm like,

41:46.800 --> 41:49.840
oh, you did this for money, you business.

41:49.840 --> 41:50.160
Yeah.

41:50.160 --> 41:53.520
And that's where I forget that KFC isn't my fun friend.

41:53.520 --> 41:54.560
Yeah, sure.

41:54.560 --> 41:56.880
Um, hey, who wants a yahoo?

41:56.880 --> 41:57.760
Hey, yahoo.

41:57.760 --> 41:58.880
I'll take one, sir.

41:58.880 --> 41:59.920
Yahoo here, sir.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.040
Uh, yahoo.

42:01.040 --> 42:02.560
Yahoo here for the boy.

42:02.560 --> 42:03.680
Here comes yahoo's.

42:03.680 --> 42:04.480
Okay, this one is-

42:04.480 --> 42:05.520
Oh, too hot!

42:05.520 --> 42:07.360
You've burned my boy's face.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.400
They don't have temperature.

42:09.280 --> 42:10.240
He's dead.

42:10.240 --> 42:10.720
There's no-

42:10.720 --> 42:12.960
Oh God, my boy is dead.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.800
Did you dump something else hot on him, sir?

42:14.800 --> 42:16.000
Because they don't have temperature.

42:17.120 --> 42:20.560
I put the yahoo on my boy's head and now he's melted.

42:20.560 --> 42:21.280
But look at it.

42:21.280 --> 42:23.760
Oh, he was my only boy.

42:23.760 --> 42:24.720
Just as you instructed,

42:24.720 --> 42:28.160
we blended it with law and gave it to him thrice daily.

42:28.720 --> 42:31.680
Um, so this yahoo was, uh, sent in by Ellie.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.920
It's from an anonymous user who asks.

42:33.920 --> 42:34.880
Oh, they need a name.

42:34.880 --> 42:35.840
I forgot that I do that.

42:41.440 --> 42:42.480
You wanna say Travis?

42:45.600 --> 42:48.080
The scrunch asks,

42:50.320 --> 42:52.000
could you have a normal relationship

42:52.000 --> 42:55.760
with someone who is very, very psychic?

42:56.960 --> 42:59.680
Like they can see everything.

42:59.680 --> 43:02.000
You wonder if anything about you is a mystery?

43:02.000 --> 43:03.200
There are five updates.

43:03.760 --> 43:04.320
Update one.

43:04.320 --> 43:05.600
Oh yes, it has happened already.

43:05.600 --> 43:07.440
Trust me, every day it happens.

43:07.440 --> 43:08.400
Update two.

43:08.400 --> 43:09.680
That said, not looking for an answer

43:09.680 --> 43:10.720
from those who don't believe it.

43:10.720 --> 43:12.000
It's a real issue I'm dealing with here

43:12.000 --> 43:14.160
from a guy who's not very open to talking to me about it.

43:14.160 --> 43:14.800
Update three.

43:14.800 --> 43:17.120
He's proven he's psychic already.

43:17.120 --> 43:17.760
Update four.

43:17.760 --> 43:20.080
No, he was talking about me eating a donut yesterday

43:20.080 --> 43:23.200
before I even knew my sister bought one at the store for me.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.400
I don't have donuts every week,

43:24.400 --> 43:26.080
so it's not a regular pattern.

43:26.080 --> 43:26.800
Update five.

43:27.520 --> 43:28.800
Thanks, in quotes.

43:28.800 --> 43:29.760
No, he is.

43:29.760 --> 43:30.960
There is proof.

43:30.960 --> 43:32.480
If you're in denial about psychics,

43:32.480 --> 43:33.760
don't answer the question.

43:33.760 --> 43:34.320
Okay.

43:34.320 --> 43:37.040
Can I, this is the first time, Griffin,

43:37.040 --> 43:39.360
at which the additional details

43:39.360 --> 43:42.640
has made me retroactively wonder about the scenario

43:42.640 --> 43:44.800
that led to the specific question.

43:44.800 --> 43:48.640
Do you think this question asker wants to date this person?

43:48.640 --> 43:51.120
No, I think they're in a relationship with this person

43:51.120 --> 43:53.360
and I think that they live together

43:53.360 --> 43:56.160
and I think that they woke up one Sunday morning

43:57.520 --> 44:00.640
and they are having a slow start to the day

44:00.640 --> 44:05.120
and the husband says, you're going to eat a cake donut

44:05.120 --> 44:07.520
and then the sister brings a cake donut

44:07.520 --> 44:10.880
and then this woman is like, holy fucking shit.

44:11.520 --> 44:14.000
You are very, very psychic.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.960
I think I would happily be in a relationship

44:16.960 --> 44:18.400
with someone who's very, very psychic.

44:18.400 --> 44:19.520
Travis, Travis, Travis.

44:19.520 --> 44:19.840
Yeah.

44:19.840 --> 44:25.520
You're not, we're not talking about fucking crossing over

44:25.520 --> 44:27.040
with John Edwards.

44:27.040 --> 44:28.000
Or Ghost Whisperer.

44:28.000 --> 44:28.480
Or Ghost Whisperer.

44:28.480 --> 44:29.760
Yeah, not bullshit like that.

44:29.760 --> 44:32.640
No, they're just psychic.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
I'm talking about someone who is very,

44:38.560 --> 44:42.160
just super psychic, Travis, real, real psychic.

44:42.720 --> 44:43.920
Here's the thing though, Griffin.

44:43.920 --> 44:44.320
Yeah?

44:44.320 --> 44:47.760
The question is not about their level of psychonicity.

44:47.760 --> 44:51.840
The question is how accepting are they of me

44:51.840 --> 44:53.920
and everything that I am, right?

44:53.920 --> 44:56.720
Do they accept me for who I am with all my flaws?

44:56.720 --> 44:59.920
Because if so, I have nothing to hide from them.

44:59.920 --> 45:00.320
Okay.

45:00.320 --> 45:02.800
It is only if they are judgmental

45:03.440 --> 45:06.320
that I would feel embarrassed if they knew everything about me.

45:06.320 --> 45:07.840
But we gotta have secrets, don't we?

45:07.840 --> 45:09.760
Little sneak, little sneak rits.

45:09.760 --> 45:12.240
That nobody gets to see stuff that we get to do

45:12.240 --> 45:15.280
that no one else gets to see that we do them.

45:15.280 --> 45:16.640
Do y'all not have-

45:16.640 --> 45:18.640
I'd rather share my sneak rits with my partner.

45:20.480 --> 45:22.640
Can we get down to the real issue of this question, please?

45:22.640 --> 45:23.520
Sure, sure.

45:23.520 --> 45:24.160
Okay.

45:24.160 --> 45:26.160
I think I felt like we've been dancing around a bit.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.120
Obviously, yes.

45:27.120 --> 45:27.360
Okay.

45:28.480 --> 45:32.080
If you're at the grocery store and you're looking at doughnuts,

45:33.040 --> 45:34.800
what prompts you to think,

45:34.800 --> 45:38.880
well, Paula doesn't frequently eat doughnuts.

45:38.880 --> 45:41.840
In fact, it's probably a less than weekly occurrence,

45:42.560 --> 45:47.760
but I'm gonna bring her one single grubby doughnut.

45:47.760 --> 45:50.480
Just to show Paula I'm thinking about her,

45:50.480 --> 45:51.760
I wanna pick one.

45:51.760 --> 45:53.280
I'm gonna get some of this paper.

45:54.080 --> 45:55.280
I'm gonna open this up.

45:55.280 --> 45:57.680
I'm gonna get one grubby little doughnut

45:57.680 --> 46:00.560
to bring to my sister who does not enjoy them enough

46:00.560 --> 46:01.920
to eat them frequently.

46:01.920 --> 46:03.360
Well, Justin, ironically enough,

46:03.360 --> 46:07.280
just like my favorite procedural mystery, psych,

46:07.280 --> 46:09.040
it is all now laying out before me.

46:09.040 --> 46:10.240
I can see the timeline.

46:10.960 --> 46:12.880
Jim called Paula and said,

46:12.880 --> 46:15.200
hey, remember when you ate that doughnut?

46:15.200 --> 46:17.280
And Paula said, I haven't eaten a doughnut

46:17.280 --> 46:19.120
in at least a week and a half.

46:19.120 --> 46:22.000
And Jim said, oh man, I look like such an idiot.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.320
So he called Paula's sister, Paula too,

46:24.320 --> 46:28.160
and said, hey, can you get Paula a doughnut today?

46:28.160 --> 46:29.520
And don't make a big deal out of it

46:29.520 --> 46:30.800
and don't tell her I called.

46:30.800 --> 46:31.680
Thank you.

46:31.680 --> 46:35.600
And the sister's going through a real bad divorce.

46:35.600 --> 46:40.080
So she's got lots of time to go get on a single doughnut run.

46:40.800 --> 46:44.320
Yeah, and also the librarian wasn't dead.

46:44.320 --> 46:47.600
He faked it so that he could sneak back in

46:47.600 --> 46:49.040
and get the jewel himself.

46:49.040 --> 46:52.240
It's just that grocery store doughnuts are the worst.

46:52.240 --> 46:54.960
I mean, if you're gonna eat a doughnut,

46:54.960 --> 46:57.120
you're gonna treat yourself to a doughnut.

46:57.120 --> 46:59.360
Don't eat one from the grocery store.

46:59.360 --> 47:02.240
Yeah, well, but the convenience factor is there, Justin.

47:02.240 --> 47:03.200
You're getting everything else.

47:03.200 --> 47:06.960
I can't get my roasted beef from a Dunkin.

47:07.520 --> 47:09.360
Yeah, man, it would be cool

47:09.360 --> 47:10.960
if you're in a relationship with somebody

47:10.960 --> 47:13.040
who could let you win the lottery every day

47:14.720 --> 47:16.560
until there was no more lottery money left

47:16.560 --> 47:17.600
because you got all of it.

47:18.320 --> 47:20.640
But then they put on the other end of the sword,

47:20.640 --> 47:22.400
they would be like, you're gonna fucking waste that.

47:23.040 --> 47:26.640
You're just thinking of someone who's very psychic.

47:26.640 --> 47:28.800
Imagine someone who's very, very psychic.

47:28.800 --> 47:30.480
So you could be like, hey,

47:30.480 --> 47:33.280
does Janice want to hang out with me on Saturday?

47:33.280 --> 47:35.200
And they could be like, she doesn't.

47:35.200 --> 47:37.040
Yeah, you're so psyched.

47:37.040 --> 47:39.440
I could see though, I buy that you're,

47:39.440 --> 47:40.720
see, that's what I wanted.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.960
I want to be like, I'm extremely psychic.

47:42.960 --> 47:44.480
I really, tell me the lottery numbers.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.080
I would love to, but honestly,

47:46.080 --> 47:49.840
it doesn't work out well for you in most of the futures

47:49.840 --> 47:50.800
that I can see.

47:50.800 --> 47:52.800
So I'm unfortunately gonna have to win.

47:52.800 --> 47:54.560
You can withhold whatever

47:54.560 --> 47:57.440
and just say that that's like, it's better that way.

47:57.440 --> 47:58.480
I'm making that call.

47:58.480 --> 47:59.600
It's better, trust me.

47:59.600 --> 48:02.560
Hey, it turns out winning all that money is bad for you.

48:02.560 --> 48:03.120
Yeah, butterfly wings.

48:03.120 --> 48:05.600
Much like it has been every single person

48:05.600 --> 48:07.200
who's ever won the lottery ever.

48:07.200 --> 48:08.720
Oh, that's a fake statistic.

48:09.440 --> 48:10.000
That can't be.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.600
Well, yeah, Griffin, of course it is.

48:11.600 --> 48:13.840
I just said every person ever.

48:13.840 --> 48:16.240
I clearly don't have any information to back that up.

48:16.240 --> 48:19.280
But anecdotally, everybody always talks about,

48:19.280 --> 48:21.600
you win the lottery, man, it's gonna ruin your life.

48:21.600 --> 48:23.200
And have there been a few cases of that?

48:23.200 --> 48:23.680
Sure.

48:23.680 --> 48:25.440
But most of the time,

48:25.440 --> 48:28.160
getting a big fucking bag of money like that,

48:28.160 --> 48:29.280
it's pretty cool shit.

48:29.920 --> 48:31.600
Hey, Griffin, can you step over here with me

48:31.600 --> 48:32.080
for a second?

48:32.080 --> 48:32.640
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

48:33.520 --> 48:34.960
Of course I fucking know that.

48:34.960 --> 48:36.480
I'm sorry, do you want me to, sorry.

48:36.480 --> 48:38.000
No, Justin, you can stay over there.

48:38.000 --> 48:38.880
You can stay over there.

48:38.880 --> 48:40.480
Should I bring jokes with me or can jokes stay with you guys?

48:40.480 --> 48:41.680
No, you and jokes can hang out.

48:41.680 --> 48:42.320
You and jokes can hang out.

48:42.320 --> 48:42.820
Okay.

48:43.360 --> 48:45.520
Griffin, I'm trying to increase my odds

48:45.520 --> 48:47.680
by getting less people to play in the lottery.

48:47.680 --> 48:48.320
Oh, jeez.

48:48.320 --> 48:50.640
So I need to tell them the lottery is bad for them.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.120
Okay.

48:51.120 --> 48:53.680
So that they won't buy tickets so I can play.

48:53.680 --> 48:54.960
I like the rubber chicken thing.

48:54.960 --> 48:55.920
We probably love rubber chickens.

48:55.920 --> 48:56.720
Okay, Griffin.

48:56.720 --> 48:57.840
Yes, that's a good idea.

48:57.840 --> 49:00.400
Forget the, forget what I said, it was a joke.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.640
No, wait, we haven't, let's go back over.

49:02.640 --> 49:03.360
Okay.

49:03.360 --> 49:04.640
Hey, we're back over here.

49:05.680 --> 49:07.360
Yeah, don't do, don't play lottery.

49:08.560 --> 49:09.280
Don't play, don't play lottery.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.320
Why, Griffin?

49:10.320 --> 49:13.760
Oh, it's, it makes you sad to do it.

49:13.760 --> 49:15.040
What kind of stuff could happen to you

49:15.040 --> 49:15.520
if you won the lottery, Griffin?

49:15.520 --> 49:19.120
No one ever, no one's, you get a big pool, you fall in.

49:20.080 --> 49:20.640
Oh, boy.

49:20.640 --> 49:22.320
And you're carrying a big bucket of coins.

49:23.440 --> 49:24.880
Guys, could you excuse me, please?

49:25.680 --> 49:26.240
Oh, sure.

49:26.960 --> 49:28.880
Could you guys, I'm gonna step over here.

49:28.880 --> 49:29.380
Okay.

49:29.840 --> 49:31.360
You shouldn't beatbox.

49:31.360 --> 49:34.400
I know you've been practicing a lot, Justin,

49:34.400 --> 49:39.040
but this is not the time to show off your beatboxing skills.

49:39.040 --> 49:41.040
And I know it seems like it would make the podcast

49:41.040 --> 49:43.520
really good and funny and it would be really cool,

49:43.520 --> 49:45.120
but I need you to not beatbox.

49:45.120 --> 49:45.920
You've made it this far.

49:46.880 --> 49:47.920
Excuse me.

49:49.120 --> 49:51.040
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

49:51.040 --> 49:54.160
I couldn't help but overhear from here.

49:54.880 --> 49:56.560
I would love to hear you beatbox.

49:59.280 --> 50:00.160
Was that it?

50:00.160 --> 50:01.840
Wait, no, Travis, that's just his open,

50:01.840 --> 50:03.520
that's just his open hi-hat.

50:03.520 --> 50:08.480
Clearly that means, closed hi-hat, closed hi-hat.

50:10.800 --> 50:12.720
Let's hear, let's hear some Tom's juice.

50:12.720 --> 50:14.240
Tom's.

50:14.240 --> 50:16.080
Tom's, Tom's, Tom's, Tom's.

50:16.080 --> 50:17.040
That's right, textbook.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.400
Now just lay all those together.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.760
Okay, Griffin will get it in post, I'm sure.

50:23.760 --> 50:29.360
Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.

50:29.360 --> 50:29.920
I'm sure.

50:29.920 --> 50:31.840
Hey, thanks for listening to our podcast,

50:31.840 --> 50:33.440
my brother, my brother, and me.

50:33.440 --> 50:36.640
It's so fun to do it for you every week.

50:36.640 --> 50:37.760
We're just having a good time.

50:37.760 --> 50:39.440
We're just having a good time here.

50:39.440 --> 50:40.080
You know what?

50:40.080 --> 50:42.080
Don't, we'd do it even if people didn't listen,

50:42.080 --> 50:44.960
but it would be, the more erotic content

50:44.960 --> 50:48.080
would be more questionable, I think.

50:48.080 --> 50:52.080
Hey, December 19th at 8 p.m., clear your calendar

50:52.080 --> 50:55.440
because we're gonna be celebrating the candle nights together.

50:55.440 --> 50:59.280
Though we can't all be physically in one area,

51:00.000 --> 51:04.880
we are still, the season arrives regardless.

51:04.880 --> 51:10.160
This is going to be a filmed candle night spectacular.

51:10.160 --> 51:13.360
We have filmed almost all of it at this point

51:13.360 --> 51:16.800
and it is going to be buck wild.

51:16.800 --> 51:17.760
It is a wild one.

51:17.760 --> 51:21.200
Yeah, we got segments from Bim Bam, Sawbone, Schmanter's Wonderful,

51:21.200 --> 51:22.640
Still Buffering, Special Guests,

51:23.760 --> 51:26.880
and it is going to be something else.

51:26.880 --> 51:29.920
Tickets are pay what you want with a $5 minimum

51:29.920 --> 51:32.240
and all proceeds go to Harmony House,

51:32.240 --> 51:36.320
which is a local shelter for people experiencing homelessness.

51:36.320 --> 51:37.920
They help so many people,

51:37.920 --> 51:40.560
Cindy volunteers there and can vouch for her.

51:40.560 --> 51:42.480
It is an amazing place

51:43.120 --> 51:46.800
and we are so proud to be supporting them again.

51:46.800 --> 51:52.400
Bit.ly forward slash candle nights 2020 is the address.

51:52.400 --> 51:54.960
Please go there and get what you can

51:54.960 --> 51:57.600
and come join us for that show.

51:57.600 --> 52:00.160
Sorry, real quick, it is $5 minimum

52:00.160 --> 52:06.400
but there will be $1.25 fee to cover the expenses

52:06.400 --> 52:07.600
of the people helping us do the show.

52:07.600 --> 52:10.960
So it will be $6.25 total just so that doesn't throw you off.

52:10.960 --> 52:15.200
And you will be able to watch it through January 4th, 2020.

52:15.200 --> 52:18.240
So you got a long period to enjoy it.

52:18.240 --> 52:21.040
You don't have to watch it right there December 19th at 8 p.m.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.600
But that is when it will go live.

52:24.320 --> 52:26.720
We also have a lot of cool McElroy merch.

52:26.720 --> 52:31.040
Well, I just wanted to say real quick that it's a really fun video

52:31.040 --> 52:32.240
and we made it really fun for you

52:32.240 --> 52:33.680
because we know everybody's had a hard year.

52:33.680 --> 52:37.440
Yeah, it's been a rough year for all of us.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.640
And so we made it with a bunch of herbs and spices.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.480
We've got a lot of cool merch over at McElroyMerch.com

52:44.480 --> 52:45.920
with some candle night stuff over there,

52:45.920 --> 52:48.160
stuff that you might've seen before, maybe you haven't.

52:48.160 --> 52:51.840
But the thing that I wanna highlight is the Festo pin of the month,

52:52.480 --> 52:54.800
which is Festo from the Adventure Zone graduation

52:54.800 --> 52:55.840
if you haven't listened yet.

52:56.400 --> 52:58.480
And that benefits the Transgender Law Center,

52:58.480 --> 53:01.040
which employs a variety of community driven strategies

53:01.040 --> 53:03.600
to keep transgender and gender nonconforming people

53:03.600 --> 53:06.400
alive, thriving, and fighting for liberation.

53:06.400 --> 53:07.360
So you can check that out

53:07.360 --> 53:10.240
as well as all the other stuff at McElroyMerch.com.

53:11.360 --> 53:12.080
And here we go.

53:12.080 --> 53:14.000
Three books I wanna tell you about my friends.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.480
One, Everybody Has a Podcast Except You

53:16.480 --> 53:17.840
is our how-to podcast book.

53:17.840 --> 53:19.200
It's available for pre-order now.

53:19.200 --> 53:21.680
Go to TheMcElroyPodcast.com.

53:21.680 --> 53:23.280
That comes out January 26th.

53:23.280 --> 53:24.640
So I think that's within a window

53:24.640 --> 53:26.880
that you could give that pre-order to someone

53:26.880 --> 53:28.960
as a candle night's present.

53:28.960 --> 53:31.760
You can also pre-order The Adventure Zone Crystal Kingdom,

53:31.760 --> 53:34.240
which is book four of our graphic novel series.

53:34.240 --> 53:36.320
Go to TheAdventureZone.com.

53:36.320 --> 53:39.760
Oh, TheAdventureZoneComic.com, I should say.

53:39.760 --> 53:42.640
And that comes out July 13th, 2021.

53:42.640 --> 53:46.320
And the Sawbones book is out in paperback on December 29th.

53:46.320 --> 53:48.560
It's newly revised and updated for 2020.

53:48.560 --> 53:52.160
You can get that at bit.ly slash Sawbones paperback.

53:53.760 --> 53:54.800
Y'all want the final,

53:54.800 --> 53:56.720
oh, thanks to John Roderick in the long winters

53:56.720 --> 53:57.520
for the use of our theme song

53:57.520 --> 53:58.400
and to departure off the album,

53:58.400 --> 53:59.520
putting the days to bed.

53:59.520 --> 54:00.640
Great tunes, great tracks.

54:00.640 --> 54:03.040
Oh, one more thing I want to say.

54:03.040 --> 54:06.160
We're doing the MBM or the MBM AM Angels

54:06.160 --> 54:07.520
is happening again.

54:07.520 --> 54:09.040
If you want to participate

54:09.040 --> 54:11.040
to help fill those empty stockings

54:11.040 --> 54:12.800
in our hometown of Huntington, West Virginia,

54:12.800 --> 54:16.160
you can go to MBMAMangels.com.

54:16.960 --> 54:19.520
And thanks to MaximumFun.org for having us on the network.

54:20.480 --> 54:22.240
Do you want the final, Yahoo?

54:22.240 --> 54:23.120
I do, Griffin.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.000
I'd really love that.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.600
This one was sent in by Amy.

54:26.160 --> 54:27.440
Or yeah, thanks, Amy.

54:27.440 --> 54:30.640
It's Yahoo Answers user Hiram who asks,

54:32.960 --> 54:33.840
let's chill.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.560
Do you Christians like V8?

54:40.160 --> 54:41.680
My name is Justin McElroy.

54:41.680 --> 54:42.560
I'm Travis Beck.

54:42.560 --> 54:44.080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

54:44.080 --> 54:45.280
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

54:45.280 --> 54:59.040
May kiss your dad, square on the lips.
