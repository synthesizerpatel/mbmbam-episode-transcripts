WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:25.520
You're not fucking Bono, sit down in the chair.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.400
That's how Bono starts his shows is he runs up and high fives you.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.640
I know one thing about Bono.

00:30.640 --> 00:34.880
I assume Bono doesn't get winded.

00:34.880 --> 00:35.880
Randy Kraut.

00:35.880 --> 00:36.880
Hi everybody.

00:36.880 --> 00:37.880
Hey guys.

00:37.880 --> 00:46.000
I loaded up my computer to get the Yahoo's ready, get the Yahoo oven preheated to 350.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
Travis, you want to tell me what popped up as soon as I typed in my password?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.240
That would be Reba McEntire's fancy.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.240
That's right.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.240
It's on Spotify premium.

00:56.240 --> 01:01.280
He knows what you need, he's making the best use of it too.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.640
I just got super nervous all of a sudden.

01:03.640 --> 01:06.000
Are you guys going to be cool or are you going to be dicks?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.800
Are you guys cool?

01:07.800 --> 01:08.800
I don't know which one that was.

01:08.800 --> 01:09.800
I don't know.

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
Yeah.

01:10.800 --> 01:11.800
Wait, wait, wait.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.800
Hold on.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.800
Welcome to my brother, my brother, me and advice show for the modern era.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.440
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.240
I'm the sweet baby brother.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.240
Oh shit.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.240
And we're done.

01:22.240 --> 01:23.240
And we're done.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.120
Thanks for listening everybody.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.560
I'm the sweet baby brother, Griffin.

01:27.560 --> 01:31.920
That'd be a tight stinger.

01:31.920 --> 01:37.680
Every time he said dope shit, it'd be like, that was our outro music.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.840
We'll do a show first and then we'll just try it again.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.840
We'll come back around.

01:40.840 --> 01:41.840
We'll come back around.

01:41.840 --> 01:42.840
Don't worry.

01:42.840 --> 01:44.160
Keep the finger on the button though, because you don't know.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.440
Because if it starts to go bad, we are dipping.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.040
We will fucking eject.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.680
Let that be a warning to you.

01:51.680 --> 01:52.680
Hello, Los Angeles.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.680
Hi, Los Angeles.

01:53.680 --> 01:58.320
Sorry we haven't, we haven't been to you in a while.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.160
I guess we haven't been to Los Angeles proper like ever.

02:01.160 --> 02:04.800
We've performed a couple of times at Lake Arrowhead, which is LA adjacent, I guess.

02:04.800 --> 02:05.800
Yeah.

02:05.800 --> 02:10.000
I mean, it's like five hours away, so not like super adjacent.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Depending on fog.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
People here hate Lake Arrowhead?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Who is booing?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
It's like the best.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Boo!

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Beautiful artificial lakes on the top of mountains.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
No, thank you.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
It's perfect.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Just like I imagined heaven to be.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.480
They give you free, lots of bacon, there's always bacon up there.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.240
Is anybody else here living in mortal terror of the fact that the Los Angeles Kings just

02:29.240 --> 02:32.800
won the Stanley Cup and, oh, sorry, spoilers, I guess.

02:32.800 --> 02:33.800
Were you waiting?

02:33.800 --> 02:34.800
No.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.360
No, I mean, it's not going to be a spoiler.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.680
You're going to cross the threshold of this building and it's going to be a nuclear wasteland

02:39.680 --> 02:40.680
outside.

02:40.680 --> 02:41.680
You're like, oh, I guess we won.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.680
Sweet.

02:42.680 --> 02:46.240
Except my, you know, my entire neighborhood's destroyed, but everything else is totally

02:46.240 --> 02:47.240
sweet.

02:47.240 --> 02:49.800
I'm not worried as much about hockey fans writing.

02:49.800 --> 02:55.040
They seem like a polite, kind of chilled out people to me.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.040
They're just so happy people are paying attention.

02:58.040 --> 03:04.280
I need my gummy berry juice.

03:04.280 --> 03:12.560
So, between the World Cup happening and the LA Kings winning, somewhere there is a man

03:12.560 --> 03:17.400
with very specific sports taste who's very happy tonight, who really feels like the superstar.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.400
Like, finally.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.400
You know what?

03:19.400 --> 03:21.640
This feels like the start of something.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.040
I think we're finally going to get the attention we deserve.

03:24.040 --> 03:28.320
So this is, raise your hand, is there anybody here for the first time who's never listened

03:28.320 --> 03:29.320
to our program?

03:29.320 --> 03:30.320
Never heard the show before.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.320
That's awesome.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.320
Cool.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.320
Fantastic.

03:33.320 --> 03:34.320
Well, welcome to you.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.320
You're wearing a My Brother, My Brother, Me T-shirt.

03:35.320 --> 03:36.320
How did that happen?

03:36.320 --> 03:37.320
I'm fucking into that.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.320
What the fuck is your story?

03:38.320 --> 03:39.320
Poser.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.320
Poser.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.320
We're going to get him up here later and I want to learn some things about that man.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.960
I want to unfold his story.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.760
I did it when I saw live for the first time, so don't feel bad.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.760
I got to see that live.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.760
I wish I had seen live.

03:48.760 --> 03:49.760
That was bullshit.

03:49.760 --> 03:50.760
You know what I was going to say?

03:50.760 --> 03:54.860
I was going to say an actual concert I've been to, which is Dave Matthews' band, but

03:54.860 --> 03:57.600
you know I was into that.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.600
No lie.

03:58.600 --> 04:03.440
So this is a device show where we take your questions, your queries, and turn them Aquame-like

04:03.440 --> 04:05.560
into wisdom.

04:05.560 --> 04:09.320
We might have some questions from the audience here, so if you want to try to cook something

04:09.320 --> 04:12.280
up in your head that is real and a problem we can fix for you.

04:12.280 --> 04:13.280
And not a bummer.

04:13.280 --> 04:14.280
Not a bummer.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.640
Not a bummer, so help me God.

04:16.640 --> 04:19.160
We are nice people.

04:19.160 --> 04:26.320
Talk to us about, we'll answer your bummer questions off the air, I guess, fun party.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.320
But not on the show.

04:27.320 --> 04:29.840
And no, like, tell them how many jokes about poop and stuff.

04:29.840 --> 04:30.840
No poop jokes.

04:30.840 --> 04:31.840
No poop jokes.

04:31.840 --> 04:32.840
Those are for us.

04:32.840 --> 04:33.840
Those are for us only.

04:33.840 --> 04:34.840
Not for you.

04:34.840 --> 04:35.840
Those are for adults only.

04:35.840 --> 04:39.880
Those are for comedy adults only, and they need to be handled carefully with precision.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.280
So you're not ready for that.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.280
Trust us.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.320
Travis, how about a question?

04:44.320 --> 04:45.920
Okay, great.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.520
These were also asked by people here, correct?

04:47.520 --> 04:48.520
Yeah.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.520
I believe so.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.520
Let's see.

04:50.520 --> 04:54.240
Oh, I won't read the person because it's the tag line.

04:54.240 --> 04:58.280
I have a lot of vivid weird dreams that more often than not contain people in my day-to-day

04:58.280 --> 04:59.280
life.

04:59.280 --> 05:04.360
Naked, and they're like on top of me and cool stuff.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.360
It's implied, right?

05:05.360 --> 05:06.360
Okay.

05:06.360 --> 05:09.080
In my day-to-day life, doing something I think is worth mentioning to them.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.080
My question is this.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.920
Is it socially acceptable to tell people that I've dreamt about them, or say you were in

05:13.920 --> 05:17.880
my dream last night, or will I be giving everyone I know the willies by doing this?

05:17.880 --> 05:20.920
And that's from I've even done it to Justin.

05:20.920 --> 05:21.920
Woof.

05:21.920 --> 05:22.920
Hachi-machi.

05:22.920 --> 05:27.600
You know, we try to keep-

05:27.600 --> 05:29.760
Do you want to raise your hand if you're here and you did this?

05:29.760 --> 05:30.760
We try to keep-

05:30.760 --> 05:31.760
You did this terrible, terrible thing?

05:31.760 --> 05:32.760
I don't see a hand.

05:32.760 --> 05:33.760
Somewhere in the void.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.760
Can you howl?

05:34.760 --> 05:35.760
No, no, no.

05:35.760 --> 05:36.760
It's better this way.

05:36.760 --> 05:37.760
No, don't do that.

05:37.760 --> 05:38.760
It's better.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.120
Could you come down and explain your dream about Justin in graphic detail?

05:41.120 --> 05:44.840
It's way better for the podcast that I have to do than if I don't know what you look like

05:44.840 --> 05:48.720
and I know you're just out there waiting.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.480
That's super cool for my stress levels.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.000
I appreciate it.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.360
That way, I can look at every face and wonder, is it them?

05:56.360 --> 06:00.360
And then look at some other faces and think, well, maybe it's them.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.360
Very flattering.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.360
All right.

06:02.360 --> 06:07.320
If there's no level of innocuousness of the subject matter of your dream, it could just

06:07.320 --> 06:10.920
be like, me, you, and Alf eating a hot dog.

06:10.920 --> 06:15.160
And then I would immediately think, and then we had a crazy Alf three-way and it was totally

06:15.160 --> 06:16.160
awesome.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.900
That was the part of the dream that you didn't tell me about, but I know that you dreamt

06:18.900 --> 06:21.120
about fucking me and Alf at the same time.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.120
Yeah.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.120
Because here's the problem.

06:23.120 --> 06:26.080
As soon as you broached the subject, you were in my dream last night.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.080
Right.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.080
The person hears fucking me.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.800
We had a wobbly age with Alf and it was totally great.

06:31.800 --> 06:35.240
It was a lowercase H. Having sex with Alf.

06:35.240 --> 06:38.560
Two in the snout and one's left out.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.040
Yikes.

06:40.040 --> 06:43.120
Sex with Alf.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.800
I want you guys to know there's a joke about eating Alf.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.640
Two in the snout and no time to pout.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.520
Have some sex with Alf.

06:49.520 --> 06:50.520
That's a new teen trend.

06:50.520 --> 06:51.520
It's called Shumwaying.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.520
Yikes.

06:52.520 --> 07:00.920
No, fucking of course not.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.200
Under no circumstances, no.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.800
There's a reason that dreams only happen in your head and it's because it's for you.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.360
Well, unless you're Travis.

07:08.360 --> 07:09.360
Travis, you tell a lot.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.360
I love you.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.360
You're my brother.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.360
My dreams are fucking awesome.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.360
Yeah.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.360
Totally.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.360
Totally.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.360
Totally.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.360
Yeah.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.360
Totally.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.360
No, yeah, totally.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.360
Totally.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.360
Totally.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.360
Sure.

07:22.360 --> 07:26.400
I remember a lot of them just because of the great stories that go on in there and that

07:26.400 --> 07:29.240
beautiful head of yours, all the great dream stories.

07:29.240 --> 07:33.440
If any of you want to hear my dreams later, just let me know.

07:33.440 --> 07:34.440
How about a Yahoo answer?

07:34.440 --> 07:35.440
That's it?

07:35.440 --> 07:36.440
Did we fucking answer that?

07:36.440 --> 07:37.440
That's fucking it.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.440
Hey, Cooper, keep your shit to yourself.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.440
I mean, it's not acceptable.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.440
I know it's not creepy.

07:40.440 --> 07:43.440
I know you're not dreaming about having sex with him, but that's what people are going

07:43.440 --> 07:44.440
to think.

07:44.440 --> 07:45.440
It implies intimacy.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.440
No question.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.440
No, it's inappropriate.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.440
Don't ever do it.

07:48.440 --> 07:49.440
Ever.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.440
Just stop dreaming.

07:50.440 --> 07:51.440
Stop dreaming.

07:51.440 --> 07:52.440
Let your dreams die.

07:52.440 --> 07:53.440
I'm 33.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.440
It ain't hard, gang.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.440
Come on.

07:55.440 --> 08:01.000
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport, who is here tonight.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Drew Davenport.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Come on.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Get the fuck up here.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
Drew Davenport, stand up and come to the stage.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Ladies and gentlemen.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Fucking keep it going.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
I want five uninterrupted minutes of applause.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Come here.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Get the fuck over here.

08:14.000 --> 08:23.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Drew Davenport, an emerald level Yahoo answer shaman, finally.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yes.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
This is what it sounds like when doves cry.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.640
Drew, thank you so much for saving our program time and time again.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.400
He's a lot taller than I thought he was going to be.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.400
Man, if I was as tall as you, Drew, I would have no time for looking for answers.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.400
I'd be too busy beating ass.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.400
Everybody, give it up for Drew fucking Davenport.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.400
You're all unnoticed.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.400
Wind beneath my wings.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.400
Drew Davenport.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.400
Drew Davenport.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.400
Drew Davenport.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.400
If it weren't for Drew Davenport, the pre-show would have been over.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.400
You're all unnoticed.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.400
You're all unnoticed.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.400
You're all unnoticed.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.400
You're all unnoticed.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.400
You're all unnoticed.

08:52.400 --> 08:56.600
If it weren't for Drew Davenport, the production time that I would put into this show would

08:56.600 --> 09:02.960
be like 20 minutes more a week, but that's a lot.

09:02.960 --> 09:03.960
That's a lot for me.

09:03.960 --> 09:04.960
Thank you.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.880
If you're listening at home, he was eight feet tall.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.800
Eight feet if he was an inch.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.320
As broad as a bull.

09:12.320 --> 09:15.560
There's a service called Yahoo Answers and we dig into it.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.240
For you three new people.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.720
No, I'm going to keep talking to them.

09:19.720 --> 09:20.840
I want to win them over.

09:20.840 --> 09:21.840
Your business I have.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.960
I want to win the new business.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.480
We try to answer them to the best of our abilities.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.200
When I say we find them, I mean Drew Davenport.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.200
Almost exclusively.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.800
Almost exclusively Drew Davenport finds them.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.180
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

09:34.180 --> 09:39.260
This Yahoo Answer was asked by a suspended account.

09:39.260 --> 09:42.000
Why were they suspended, you asked?

09:42.000 --> 09:49.240
How could I make wee bowling sexy?

09:49.240 --> 09:53.880
So my girlfriend and I have a habit of trying to make simple everyday things into something

09:53.880 --> 09:55.480
remotely sexy.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.720
So they're not trying super hard.

09:57.720 --> 09:58.720
No, yeah.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.760
Our bar is low.

10:00.760 --> 10:04.040
You're making that grilled cheese, why don't you get a bowl out?

10:04.040 --> 10:05.040
Sure.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.720
My chatbook's looking mighty balanced.

10:08.720 --> 10:12.840
Does anyone have any clue how we can make something like wee bowling sexy?

10:12.840 --> 10:15.480
Also I do realize this is a ridiculous question.

10:15.480 --> 10:21.480
They should just fucking have some sort of script on Yahoo Answers that immediately puts

10:21.480 --> 10:23.480
that at the bottom of everybody's question.

10:23.480 --> 10:29.280
That's about putting Doritos in your butt, like yeah, it's pretty ridiculous.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.280
What about this?

10:30.280 --> 10:31.280
I got an answer.

10:31.280 --> 10:37.160
What if you play wee bowling with your balls out?

10:37.160 --> 10:40.320
Don't fucking salt my game, Travis.

10:40.320 --> 10:47.160
You play wee bowling, and while you're playing it.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.160
Put the kids to bed.

10:48.160 --> 10:51.240
Put the kids right in the sleepy town.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.240
You play wee bowling.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.240
Here comes the sex.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.240
Quiet, quiet.

10:54.240 --> 10:55.240
While you're playing it.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.240
What are you doing?

10:56.240 --> 10:57.240
You have a sex.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.240
That is going to throw off your handicapped.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.240
Yeah.

10:59.240 --> 11:12.240
No question about it.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.240
Too hot for TV.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.240
Sorry.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.240
Keep that.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.240
A bowling handicap?

11:17.240 --> 11:18.240
It's a thing.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.240
It's a thing.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.240
I guess.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.240
Like bumpers?

11:21.240 --> 11:22.240
You're bumping something.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.240
Yeah.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.240
Yeah.

11:24.240 --> 11:25.240
Genitals.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.240
Like your genitals.

11:26.240 --> 11:27.240
Genitals.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.240
Yeah.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.240
Genitals.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.240
Genitals.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.240
Genitals.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.240
Genitals.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.240
That's what we're doing in New York.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.240
Talking about your genitals.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.240
Yeah.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.240
You're bumping your genitals.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.240
Ah.

11:37.240 --> 11:38.240
I saw some rocket loot being tossed around.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.240
That would probably be integral.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.240
Well, I mean.

11:40.240 --> 11:41.240
You got to be careful.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.240
You got to be careful.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.240
Because you'll throw it right out of your hand.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.240
Yeah.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.240
You'll smash that TV to fucking bits.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.240
There's nothing sexy about breaking your television.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.520
That'll kill the mood.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.520
When you're doing that, though, do you use protection?

11:49.520 --> 11:53.560
By which I mean use the Wiimote wrist strap.

11:53.560 --> 11:54.560
On your wiener?

11:54.560 --> 11:55.560
No.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.400
On your fucking wrist, Travis.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.120
On your fucking degenerate?

11:59.120 --> 12:00.120
No.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.120
No.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.120
Listen.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.120
I said degenerate.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.120
But I'm not here to pass judgment.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.120
No.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.120
Listen.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.120
If you like them twerked, you like them squeezed, you like them worked, whatever.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.120
It pleases.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.120
You like them Wiimoted, I guess.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.120
You like them.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.120
Okay.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.120
I guess.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.120
I'm trying to be really accepting.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.240
It's my new thing for 2014.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.240
Sorry.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.240
2013.

12:17.240 --> 12:18.240
No.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.240
Sorry.

12:19.240 --> 12:20.240
2014?

12:20.240 --> 12:21.240
20-forward.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.240
20-forward.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.240
There we go.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.240
Yeah.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.240
That was a test to find the true fans.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.240
Yeah.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.240
That's a motto we've really subscribed to.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.240
Yeah.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.240
Yeah.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.240
Well, we did some live shows this year.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.240
We've been doing good about that.

12:31.240 --> 12:32.240
I guess that's true.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.240
Can I give you a sneak preview?

12:33.240 --> 12:34.240
Because I'll forget about it.

12:34.240 --> 12:35.240
Sure.

12:35.240 --> 12:36.240
And what I was thinking for next year.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.240
Yeah.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.240
20-spliff-teen.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.240
Sure.

12:39.240 --> 12:44.240
He's so bad.

12:44.240 --> 12:48.000
What won't he say?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Like drugs?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Oh.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Okay.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Gotcha.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Yeah.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
How about a regular non-Yahoo?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Okay.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Great.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
That also comes from hopefully someone in the audience.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Can we call these Google questions?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
That might be fun.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
I mean, they're all Gmail.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Sorry.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Go ahead.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
No.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Let's talk more about web platforms.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
All right.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Spliff-teen.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Yeah.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Got it.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Read the question.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Come on.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
How do I prepare myself to be robbed?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Terrific.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.640
We should all actually be thinking about this legitimately.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.960
I have many examples of this, but one time my cousin jumped out of the bushes and saw

13:25.960 --> 13:26.960
me and scared me.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.360
My knees locked and I fell over like a fainting goat.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.360
It was very embarrassing.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.040
What if this happens when an assailant tries to jump me with a knife?

13:34.040 --> 13:36.680
I want to stay on my ground and at least seem threatening.

13:36.680 --> 13:40.480
How do I get tougher and less scared of people jumping out and surprising me?

13:40.480 --> 13:43.680
And that's from neither fight nor flight in the fourth round.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.680
Did you actually fucking manage to get in the fourth row?

13:45.680 --> 13:46.680
Nailed it.

13:46.680 --> 13:47.680
God damn.

13:47.680 --> 13:48.680
Nailed it.

13:48.680 --> 13:49.680
That's dedication right there.

13:49.680 --> 13:50.680
That's a called shot.

13:50.680 --> 13:51.680
Sorry.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.680
What's your name?

13:52.680 --> 13:53.680
JP.

13:53.680 --> 13:54.680
JP.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.480
JP.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.480
No you're fine.

13:57.480 --> 13:58.480
See how you're fine.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.960
I don't think it's as bad as you thought it was going to be.

13:59.960 --> 14:03.920
Hey everybody, if you see JP later after the show, just give him a little spook.

14:03.920 --> 14:04.920
That's it.

14:04.920 --> 14:05.920
We got to toughen you up.

14:05.920 --> 14:06.920
We're going to toughen you up.

14:06.920 --> 14:07.920
This is immersion therapy, JP.

14:07.920 --> 14:08.920
We got to rock the gauntlet.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.800
That's how Daredevil got started.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.960
People just kept spooking him and spooking him and spooking him.

14:12.960 --> 14:13.960
And then he went blind.

14:13.960 --> 14:14.960
He did go blind.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.720
He went blind from the spooks.

14:16.720 --> 14:17.720
Not from...

14:17.720 --> 14:18.720
No, it was like ass spooking him.

14:18.720 --> 14:19.720
Oh God, I spooked you too hard.

14:19.720 --> 14:20.720
I spooked you too hard.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.720
You're eyeballing.

14:21.720 --> 14:22.720
I'll be your friend forever.

14:22.720 --> 14:28.520
My name's Foggy Nelson, backstory, origin, one guy, thank you, sir.

14:28.520 --> 14:31.520
In Daredevil's...

14:31.520 --> 14:33.440
I would throw this out, JP.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.440
A knife.

14:34.440 --> 14:35.440
What?

14:35.440 --> 14:36.440
Whoa.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.440
Look out.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.640
Also, I'm going to fucking break you of saying let me throw this out.

14:39.640 --> 14:40.640
Okay.

14:40.640 --> 14:41.640
It's the last thing I do.

14:41.640 --> 14:42.640
Holy shit.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.640
Thank you.

14:43.640 --> 14:44.640
I can't believe...

14:44.640 --> 14:45.640
Can we like come up with some sort of audience response?

14:45.640 --> 14:46.640
Like some sort of like great chorus?

14:46.640 --> 14:51.640
Does anyone have a can full of pennies you can shake at me when I do it?

14:51.640 --> 14:52.640
No, no can.

14:52.640 --> 14:57.400
I was taught by my parents, and I assume my brothers were too, that when accosted-

14:57.400 --> 14:58.400
Make yourself small.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.720
By a potential robber, you seem as non-threatening as possible.

15:01.720 --> 15:02.720
Sure.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.720
You say, yes, of course, sir.

15:03.720 --> 15:04.720
Yes.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.720
Here you go.

15:05.720 --> 15:06.720
Or madam, let's not be sexist.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.720
Yeah.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.400
Sir or madam, who is robbing me at this moment, here are all my belongings.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.400
Thank you very much.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.400
Yeah, please take them.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.400
And congratulations.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.400
This is some great stuff.

15:14.400 --> 15:15.920
I hope you enjoy them more than I do.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.880
You have bested me.

15:17.880 --> 15:21.040
Listen, I'll be a good sport in this regard.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.240
You have won this encounter.

15:23.240 --> 15:26.360
And let me also congratulate you on your choice of targets.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.360
You have couldn't have-

15:27.360 --> 15:28.880
You have done very well.

15:28.880 --> 15:32.120
And then you lay on your back and pee all over yourself to show submission.

15:32.120 --> 15:36.920
Out of curiosity, what could I do better in the future to prevent myself from being such

15:36.920 --> 15:37.920
an obvious target robber?

15:37.920 --> 15:40.400
I'm just going to slide this comment card across the table.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.480
If you could fill that out before you leave, I appreciate it.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.480
Have you experienced better?

15:43.480 --> 15:48.320
Was I not robbable, robbable, or very robbable?

15:48.320 --> 15:58.840
JP, you've got to get diesel.

15:58.840 --> 16:02.360
There's the only one kind of person that's not afraid of other people.

16:02.360 --> 16:03.360
Drew Davenport.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.360
Okay, there's two.

16:04.360 --> 16:05.360
Drew Davenport.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.360
Drew Davenport.

16:06.360 --> 16:07.360
And the Lou Ferrigno's of the world.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.360
These super diesel folks.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.240
I would fold those two categories sort of in together.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.240
Yeah.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.240
He is Ferrigno in scale.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.240
You're Drew Ferrigno's.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.240
Drew Ferrigno.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.240
Drew Ferrigno.

16:16.240 --> 16:20.000
If you get Drew Ferrigno diesel, and then no one will mess with you.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.440
Except for Lou Ferrigno, and then it's just a battle of titans between the two of you.

16:24.440 --> 16:27.840
We actually should, like, if you could not mess up the curve, because we need as many

16:27.840 --> 16:30.720
people sort of like looking like obvious targets for robbery as possible.

16:30.720 --> 16:31.720
Yeah, yeah.

16:31.720 --> 16:32.720
It helps us to blend in.

16:32.720 --> 16:33.720
I try to look so tough.

16:33.720 --> 16:37.040
I've only been robbed once, and you could do the tactic which I employed, which worked

16:37.040 --> 16:41.480
out like super well for me, which is to lie about the things that you have.

16:41.480 --> 16:45.280
It's a risky gambit, I will be honest.

16:45.280 --> 16:48.800
This is not a goof.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.280
Griffin was working at GameStop when he was younger.

16:51.280 --> 16:55.840
Guy comes in and says, give me all the PS3s you have, points a gun at Griffin.

16:55.840 --> 16:59.360
And me, Mr. Brand loyal to GameStop.

16:59.360 --> 17:05.640
Icy veins, no fucking skin in the game whatsoever says, we don't have any.

17:05.640 --> 17:14.440
Also, so you know, the only thing protecting this ruse was a door behind Griffin.

17:14.440 --> 17:18.680
Which in which, behind which was a giant pyramid of PlayStation 3s.

17:18.680 --> 17:19.680
Right.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.420
Oh, those PS3s.

17:21.420 --> 17:25.320
Another fun part of that story is I didn't, I wasn't allowed to open the register without

17:25.320 --> 17:28.800
making a sale because GameStop had never taught me how.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.240
So they said, open the register.

17:30.240 --> 17:36.040
And I said, let me get my manager and expose her to this robbery.

17:36.040 --> 17:42.560
Let me pass along this cool Sunday I'm having and share it with a friend.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.440
Come have a portion of my cool Sunday, manager.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.040
You know what this encounter needs?

17:47.040 --> 17:48.040
Witnesses.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.040
Yes.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.040
How about another Yahoo?

17:50.040 --> 17:51.040
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.040
Man, I'm glad I'm not dead.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.040
Me too, in a way.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.040
Yeah.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.040
We never would have been able to do this show.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.040
We would have.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.040
It just would have been missing something.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.040
Yeah.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.040
This Yahoo was sent in by Nat Steinsultz.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.040
Maybe here?

18:00.040 --> 18:01.040
I don't know.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.040
There's a lot of people who live in Los Angeles.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.040
No, I guess not.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.040
Thank you, Nat, by Yahoo Answers.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.040
Thank you, Nat, by Yahoo Answers.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.040
Thank you, Nat, by Yahoo Answers.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.040
Thank you, Nat, by Yahoo Answers.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.040
Thank you, Nat, by Yahoo Answers.

18:08.040 --> 18:20.120
Thank you, Nat, by Yahoo Answers user Romario, who asks, my manager is a female, and she

18:20.120 --> 18:28.640
pees so loud, how do I tell her that's annoying?

18:28.640 --> 18:29.640
How could that?

18:29.640 --> 18:31.000
How often does that come up?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
How thin are those walls?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
How close are you?

18:33.000 --> 18:37.480
Why don't you dismiss yourself from the region?

18:37.480 --> 18:39.440
Do you work in a food cart?

18:39.440 --> 18:40.440
Maybe that's what's going on.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.440
You can't get out.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.440
Maybe he's a bathroom attendant.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.400
Okay, so wait.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.400
Just to be clear, he-

18:46.400 --> 18:47.400
Whoa.

18:47.400 --> 18:51.320
The fiction was so bad that it gave Justin a-

18:51.320 --> 18:55.640
He's a bathroom attendant who has a boss that comes by just to see how the attending-

18:55.640 --> 18:56.640
Justin, check up.

18:56.640 --> 18:57.640
Let me test and see what you did.

18:57.640 --> 18:58.640
Let me ruin your work, Robbie.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.640
Fuck you.

18:59.640 --> 19:00.640
Clean up on me, Robbie.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.640
Listen to how loud-

19:01.640 --> 19:07.080
Listen to how hard I can push this out.

19:07.080 --> 19:10.680
How bad could this possibly be?

19:10.680 --> 19:12.680
Sploosh.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.680
Sploosh.

19:14.680 --> 19:21.360
I mean, bad enough that he says annoying, not like gross or like it makes you go, it's

19:21.360 --> 19:22.360
annoying.

19:22.360 --> 19:23.360
There she goes.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.360
God damn it.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.360
Fuck.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.360
Again?

19:26.360 --> 19:27.360
Maybe the manager has-

19:27.360 --> 19:28.360
Jesus.

19:28.360 --> 19:33.940
Maybe the manager has some sort of cool pee kegels, and she can pee out, listen, stick

19:33.940 --> 19:34.940
with it.

19:34.940 --> 19:35.940
Now we're going somewhere.

19:35.940 --> 19:40.920
She can pee out the rhythm to Gangnam Style and it's like, Gangnam Style.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.880
Gangnam Style, really?

19:42.880 --> 19:45.680
It's 2014.

19:45.680 --> 19:52.320
Kegel another song.

19:52.320 --> 19:57.360
I know it's not a jukebox, but you got to teach that thing another song.

19:57.360 --> 20:04.600
She doesn't know where to find another one of those player piano spools.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.600
Travis liked it.

20:05.600 --> 20:06.600
I don't know.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.600
I love that joke.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.600
That was a good joke.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.600
I don't know why you guys, Travis likes it.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.600
That's all I care about.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.600
I was confused about the physiology, I guess.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.800
I don't understand why you would stay close by.

20:14.800 --> 20:15.800
Just you know what's going to happen.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.800
Maybe it's like looking at a car accident, like he doesn't want to.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.800
There are a lot of variables.

20:19.800 --> 20:20.800
I've got a timer.

20:20.800 --> 20:21.800
See how fast you can get done today.

20:21.800 --> 20:22.800
A lot of variables apply.

20:22.800 --> 20:23.800
Ooh, shaved off three seconds.

20:23.800 --> 20:24.800
Sure.

20:24.800 --> 20:25.800
We're talking about distance to the turret light.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.920
We're talking about thickness of the walls of the turret light zone.

20:28.920 --> 20:33.540
And we're talking, to be fair, to give this guy the benefit of the doubt, the general loudness

20:33.540 --> 20:35.880
of this manager's team.

20:35.880 --> 20:36.880
Like decibel level.

20:36.880 --> 20:37.880
Like wow.

20:37.880 --> 20:40.400
Like synths around, like holy shit.

20:40.400 --> 20:44.600
I feel like all you have to do, and it would take a bolder man than me, but when she comes

20:44.600 --> 20:45.600
out, be like, hey.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.600
Hey, are you okay?

20:46.600 --> 20:47.600
Are you okay?

20:47.600 --> 20:48.600
I'm worried about you.

20:48.600 --> 20:57.920
This could be the start of the worst moonlighting style will they won't they I've ever heard.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.840
We've been dancing around this for a while.

20:59.840 --> 21:00.840
You pee real loud.

21:00.840 --> 21:01.840
You pee super loud.

21:01.840 --> 21:02.840
So loud.

21:02.840 --> 21:06.280
Like really loud and really short.

21:06.280 --> 21:12.520
Like it just like, just like it falls out of you.

21:12.520 --> 21:17.680
It sounds like somebody overturning a bucket and I'm worried about you.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.200
And then you come out real wobbly legs.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.200
Yeah.

21:21.200 --> 21:25.400
And you're frowning, but kind of laughing.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.640
And here's the other thing about it.

21:26.640 --> 21:27.640
I hate it.

21:27.640 --> 21:28.640
I hate it so much.

21:28.640 --> 21:32.760
I hate when it happens in the bucket and I'm like, darling, I hate it, darling.

21:32.760 --> 21:37.560
You're the worst manager, but this is the best job.

21:37.560 --> 21:40.000
And frankly, I can't fall asleep without that noise anymore.

21:40.000 --> 21:48.520
So I guess, I guess, I guess what I'm saying to answer your question, Reverend, I do.

21:48.520 --> 21:56.680
How about a, how about a regular, how about a normie?

21:56.680 --> 21:57.680
You all right?

21:57.680 --> 21:58.680
I can read it.

21:58.680 --> 21:59.680
I'll read it.

21:59.680 --> 22:09.240
I just pictured her peeing on the altar.

22:09.240 --> 22:12.200
Goof, goof so hard I broke Travis.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.880
Oh Jesus.

22:14.880 --> 22:20.080
Dear brothers, ice cream trucks never pass where I live, ever.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.880
So sorry.

22:21.880 --> 22:22.880
This is a problem.

22:22.880 --> 22:23.880
All right.

22:23.880 --> 22:27.400
Ice truck, ice cream trucks never pass where I live, ever.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.720
Okay, I heard one outside and I booked it out the door.

22:30.720 --> 22:33.400
He was driving away from me, but I finally caught up with him.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.400
Well done.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.400
Good work.

22:35.400 --> 22:40.980
Those things, those things don't drive especially fast, if I remember correctly, but still kudos

22:40.980 --> 22:41.980
to you, I suppose.

22:41.980 --> 22:43.200
Faster than human land speed.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.200
I guess.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.060
You earned your dilly bar.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.120
When I bought my, how old am I?

22:48.120 --> 22:51.280
When I bought my ice cream, the ice cream guy just gave me this incredulous face and

22:51.280 --> 22:55.440
seemed to be annoyed that a 20-ish year old would be so excited about it.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.480
You know your age, right, I'm guessing?

22:57.480 --> 23:00.160
Yeah, but like the ice cream- I was left on a doorstep.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.160
It's good storytelling.

23:01.160 --> 23:06.920
He's not forcing omnipotence and omniscience onto the ice cream truck driver.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.640
Would be so excited about an ice cream truck.

23:08.640 --> 23:14.520
Am I too old to be excited about ice cream trucks or was the ice cream guy just a downer?

23:14.520 --> 23:17.840
And that's from vexed in Ventura question for you audience.

23:17.840 --> 23:20.080
Vexed in Ventura, are you here?

23:20.080 --> 23:21.480
Hey, welcome.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.480
Hey.

23:22.480 --> 23:29.440
If you're an ice cream driver and it's 2014 and you're in LA, how good is business that

23:29.440 --> 23:33.600
you can fucking get judgy on people?

23:33.600 --> 23:35.240
I don't know.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.480
It feels like you should go, do you want anything else?

23:37.480 --> 23:38.480
Yeah.

23:38.480 --> 23:39.480
Please?

23:39.480 --> 23:40.480
Let's do a quick audience poll.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.600
Also, can you think of anything else cold that I could sell?

23:42.600 --> 23:43.600
Because I'm dying here.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.360
Time's fucking broke out.

23:45.360 --> 23:46.980
Let's do a quick poll of the audience.

23:46.980 --> 23:47.980
This is interesting.

23:47.980 --> 23:53.760
In the last, let's say, three months, has anybody seen an ice cream truck that was stationary

23:53.760 --> 23:55.360
and selling its product to anybody?

23:55.360 --> 23:57.000
Just a quick show of hands, stationary.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Okay, more than I thought.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Better question.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Better question.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.400
No, I'll be the first to admit that I fucked up with my judgment.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.640
I haven't seen a stationary ice cream.

24:04.640 --> 24:08.800
Every time it's just like slowly crawling at five miles an hour, it's like, anybody?

24:08.800 --> 24:11.880
And I'm not talking, by the way, I want to clarify, I'm not talking about a food truck.

24:11.880 --> 24:12.880
No, no, no.

24:12.880 --> 24:13.880
You know what I'm talking about.

24:13.880 --> 24:14.880
Ice cream.

24:14.880 --> 24:19.440
I'm not talking about our keys and all like, it's got avocados in it.

24:19.440 --> 24:23.600
That's what you sound like, food truck drivers, I guess.

24:23.600 --> 24:29.600
I don't know what the ice cream truck environment is here, but I know what it's like in Cincinnati.

24:29.600 --> 24:35.560
When you see said ice cream trucks, is the paint peeling and the pictures faded and it

24:35.560 --> 24:37.320
looks like they just killed kids?

24:37.320 --> 24:43.820
Sometimes they've got Pikachu on it and it's like, hey guys, let me just call Nintendo

24:43.820 --> 24:44.820
real quick.

24:44.820 --> 24:50.320
Yeah, you didn't like go through the right fucking channels to get fucking Pikachu to

24:50.320 --> 24:55.360
sell your iced wares?

24:55.360 --> 25:02.480
I would, I would feel uncomfortable and only because I would be so worried that I would

25:02.480 --> 25:08.280
come up from vector A and sort of like in my periphery out of nowhere would be a kid

25:08.280 --> 25:11.900
on vector B and we would arrive at the same time.

25:11.900 --> 25:14.240
And you would force the issue like, I was here first.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.240
You know, I was here first.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.240
Hold on.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.600
We got, sorry gents, we got one push pop left.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.560
Looks like you're going to have to wrestle for it.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.560
Sweet.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.040
You're really little and I'm really big.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.520
You just want to give it to me?

25:25.520 --> 25:29.440
I would grab their head and just push it below the window so the guy couldn't see them until

25:29.440 --> 25:32.120
I was done purchasing my novelties.

25:32.120 --> 25:37.280
Have you guys noticed that the only people on fucking earth that call them novelties

25:37.280 --> 25:40.760
at the grocery store, they used to confuse the hell out of me when I was a kid.

25:40.760 --> 25:41.760
What's a novel?

25:41.760 --> 25:42.760
It's ice cream shit.

25:42.760 --> 25:43.760
We all know what you're talking about.

25:43.760 --> 25:46.520
You don't have to get fucking fancy, Kroger.

25:46.520 --> 25:51.800
You sell big K. Don't fuck with me.

25:51.800 --> 25:52.800
Do you want another Yahoo?

25:52.800 --> 25:53.800
No, I'll buy these.

25:53.800 --> 25:54.800
Do you want another Yahoo question?

25:54.800 --> 25:55.800
A little Yahoo.

25:55.800 --> 25:56.800
Yahoo Knights mystery.

25:56.800 --> 26:05.440
I actually just had something pop up in my head that I wanted to, no, no, no, no, no.

26:05.440 --> 26:11.000
So we were, we were supposed to have some merch and it didn't come.

26:11.000 --> 26:21.860
And so I wrote a little apology and an explanation as to why the merch wasn't here and I would

26:21.860 --> 26:29.840
like to read it for you now.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.880
Sorry that there is no merch tonight.

26:31.880 --> 26:34.480
Here's what happened.

26:34.480 --> 26:41.280
We ordered a slushy amount of the jankiest stuff, posters, tote bags, banana hammocks,

26:41.280 --> 26:44.760
boners, frosted nuts, everything.

26:44.760 --> 26:48.960
But the shipment was delayed by a flock of slurping sponges.

26:48.960 --> 26:54.600
Those driving butts got in front of the bodacious penis hat filled with our merch.

26:54.600 --> 26:59.280
Merch that was supposed to go to you, our moist puppies.

26:59.280 --> 27:12.760
But from the bottom of our nipples, we apologize, love the pickled McElroy brothers.

27:12.760 --> 27:13.760
Thank you.

27:13.760 --> 27:21.180
You know, the funny, the funny thing about listening to that, A, nothing, B, do you notice

27:21.180 --> 27:25.840
how no one was really like, there was sort of an initial like, this is going to be so

27:25.840 --> 27:26.840
great.

27:26.840 --> 27:30.480
And then like, fucking nothing from you.

27:30.480 --> 27:34.640
Remember how you didn't laugh at all for the past 45 seconds?

27:34.640 --> 27:36.200
It's not funny.

27:36.200 --> 27:39.240
I will be signing copies of this later.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.760
The one he has and the one I have.

27:41.760 --> 27:42.760
And others he can scribble out for you.

27:42.760 --> 27:46.120
I did a fun gag where like I like saying my beer like, oh, this makes you so mad, I'm

27:46.120 --> 27:47.120
gonna say my beer.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.400
I don't know how many beer left when we just started.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.400
Ahem.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.400
Give me some of your angry orchard, Justin.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.400
Okay, sure.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.400
Give me half a pour, maybe.

27:53.400 --> 27:54.400
Yeah, I'll give you half.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.400
Thank you.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.400
How about Yahoo?

27:56.400 --> 27:57.400
Listen, I can't go on.

27:57.400 --> 28:00.400
This Yahoo was sent in by Josh Williams.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.400
Josh, are you here?

28:01.400 --> 28:02.960
If anybody wants to bring us another beer, you're welcome.

28:02.960 --> 28:03.960
No, don't.

28:03.960 --> 28:04.960
I don't want to do that.

28:04.960 --> 28:05.960
No, but one at a time.

28:05.960 --> 28:06.960
Please.

28:06.960 --> 28:07.960
No, I'm just kidding.

28:07.960 --> 28:08.960
Don't do that.

28:08.960 --> 28:09.960
Thank you, Josh.

28:09.960 --> 28:20.400
It's by Yahoo Answers user supertifster who asks, I need extremely dirty truth or dares.

28:20.400 --> 28:26.360
Every time I pick a Yahoo or rather Josh Williams or Drew Davenport sends a Yahoo to me, I always

28:26.360 --> 28:29.360
hope, like, is this going to be in the next Warrior Cats?

28:29.360 --> 28:32.840
I think this one might.

28:32.840 --> 28:35.120
We can never think of any help.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.120
That's fine.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.120
Kind of basic.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.120
Not a lot there.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.120
Listen, we could do a few.

28:39.120 --> 28:45.360
I'm not as interested in that as I am about what the helpful folks on Yahoo Answers...

28:45.360 --> 28:53.840
Oh, that's funny that you say that because Yahoo Answers user bigwavegirl2006 has a few

28:53.840 --> 28:55.760
helpful suggestions.

28:55.760 --> 29:03.080
It's worth pointing out, this user is definitely, definitely suspended, holy shit, to like the

29:03.080 --> 29:09.280
ninth level of Yahoo hell.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.880
I'm not making this up.

29:10.880 --> 29:14.480
This is the actual order in which these were sent in.

29:14.480 --> 29:16.440
Number one, truth questions.

29:16.440 --> 29:20.940
Number one, ask a girl if she were a guy which girl in the room she would date.

29:20.940 --> 29:22.440
Do the same to a guy.

29:22.440 --> 29:23.440
Okay?

29:23.440 --> 29:24.440
All right.

29:24.440 --> 29:25.440
Sure.

29:25.440 --> 29:32.560
Number two, do you swallow or spit?

29:32.560 --> 29:33.560
That's for girls.

29:33.560 --> 29:34.680
For boys.

29:34.680 --> 29:38.280
What's the fastest you have C-U-M?

29:38.280 --> 29:39.280
What the fuck?

29:39.280 --> 29:40.280
This game escalated.

29:40.280 --> 29:44.320
Who would you date in the room to?

29:44.320 --> 29:47.320
How fast do you cum, Jake?

29:47.320 --> 29:50.840
No, not just how fast.

29:50.840 --> 29:51.840
What's the fastest?

29:51.840 --> 29:52.840
Not the average.

29:52.840 --> 29:54.560
I don't want to mean...

29:54.560 --> 29:56.720
I don't want a median of cum times.

29:56.720 --> 29:58.440
I want to know the peak of the curve.

29:58.440 --> 30:02.000
What do you clock out at?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.320
I want to know your curve breaking cum times.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.240
That's what I need.

30:06.240 --> 30:10.020
I want to know what's breaking the bell curve of your ejaculate.

30:10.020 --> 30:14.360
And then way over here off the line, 30 seconds.

30:14.360 --> 30:15.800
Interesting.

30:15.800 --> 30:16.800
Is this an outlier?

30:16.800 --> 30:17.800
I don't know, Malcolm.

30:17.800 --> 30:18.800
Is it?

30:18.800 --> 30:24.800
How fast do you cum?

30:24.800 --> 30:26.040
How about number 17?

30:26.040 --> 30:27.040
Have you ever skinny-dipped?

30:27.040 --> 30:29.080
Okay, good.

30:29.080 --> 30:33.520
Number 25, which guy playing do you think has the longest penis?

30:33.520 --> 30:39.440
Those are actually kind of connected, like, well, let me find out.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.440
Let's do 17.

30:40.440 --> 30:43.200
25 will be answered very quickly.

30:43.200 --> 30:49.480
Number four, which girl do you think would give the best PJ?

30:49.480 --> 30:50.480
Cool big wave girl, cool.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.480
Which girl do you think would give the best PJ?

30:51.480 --> 30:52.480
Seems so like...

30:52.480 --> 30:58.160
I'm going to go with Susan.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.160
She's just a hard worker.

30:59.160 --> 31:01.600
Seems like she'd really commit.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.600
She'd give it her all.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.960
I worked with her on a science project last year and she did not give up until it was

31:05.960 --> 31:06.960
done.

31:06.960 --> 31:07.960
I'm going to go with Susan.

31:07.960 --> 31:08.960
Ladies, can I just...

31:08.960 --> 31:09.960
Sorry, Lydia.

31:09.960 --> 31:15.880
Ladies, can I just ask everybody sitting in the circle to just yodel for me?

31:15.880 --> 31:16.880
Okay.

31:16.880 --> 31:17.880
Interesting.

31:17.880 --> 31:18.880
Some surprises here.

31:18.880 --> 31:22.560
I'm going to have to go to the leaderboard.

31:22.560 --> 31:23.560
This is a great one.

31:23.560 --> 31:24.560
Let's go to the leaderboard, Moe.

31:24.560 --> 31:27.920
Who gets a piece of that radical rock?

31:27.920 --> 31:29.400
Okay, guts.

31:29.400 --> 31:30.400
Let's talk about guts.

31:30.400 --> 31:34.120
How about number 11?

31:34.120 --> 31:44.200
Who has the biggest ball you've ever seen?

31:44.200 --> 31:46.360
Left or right does not matter.

31:46.360 --> 31:51.920
There's a lot of nuance to number 11 because they add funny since it can be told literally,

31:51.920 --> 31:53.920
but someone will take it sexually.

31:53.920 --> 31:56.880
I could be talking about a medicine ball.

31:56.880 --> 32:01.800
No, you couldn't.

32:01.800 --> 32:05.960
Not enough a jillion years could you be doing that, but God, how badly do you want to play

32:05.960 --> 32:09.000
through the day with that guy or is that, wait, hold on.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Hold on.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Do you need genitals or medicine ball?

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Point of order.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Just want to clarify.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Super quick point of order.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.880
Because what if somebody in this circle had one ascended ball and one crazy huge descended

32:18.880 --> 32:27.360
ball, like wow, like wowzers, like wow, like an egg yolk in there, like wow, like crazy.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.360
An egg yolk?

32:28.360 --> 32:31.720
Yeah, because it would be like, you know, you look at an egg yolk and it's just like

32:31.720 --> 32:34.480
one thing sort of suspended it in another thing.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.280
I tried to think of something more organic.

32:36.280 --> 32:40.040
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.560
That's the good stuff right there.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.560
What's your name?

32:42.560 --> 32:45.400
Because this is like the fourth drink that you've bought for us.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.400
What's your name?

32:46.400 --> 32:47.400
Here we go.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.400
Here it comes.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.400
I'm Jenny and that's John.

32:49.400 --> 32:50.400
Jenny and John.

32:50.400 --> 32:51.400
Famous forever.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.400
They saved the jokes.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.400
Get the groove juice flowing.

32:53.400 --> 33:04.160
What is harder than watching a guy slam a cider?

33:04.160 --> 33:05.800
Nothing.

33:05.800 --> 33:09.120
I would crush this on my head, but it's tall.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.120
You know what would happen then.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.120
I'd get lacerations.

33:11.120 --> 33:13.120
You want to jump to dares?

33:13.120 --> 33:14.120
Number 17.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.960
Play one round in your underwear.

33:15.960 --> 33:16.960
Cool.

33:16.960 --> 33:17.960
Number 23.

33:17.960 --> 33:20.720
Stick your finger in your ass and then lick it.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.720
What in the?

33:22.720 --> 33:30.600
Big wave girl, go fuck yourself.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.680
I would like to go back to truth.

33:33.680 --> 33:34.680
I regret asking.

33:34.680 --> 33:39.880
Stick your finger in your ass and then call your mom and apologize, you terrible person.

33:39.880 --> 33:43.580
We didn't even invite you, Debra.

33:43.580 --> 33:46.080
That seems like how to end a truth or dare game.

33:46.080 --> 33:49.440
I dare you to put your finger in your butt.

33:49.440 --> 33:52.640
God damn it, Steve.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.400
Are you going to do it?

33:54.400 --> 34:00.160
No, that was me leaving, but now I feel on the spot.

34:00.160 --> 34:03.360
They pay like $25.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.760
How much would you pay to watch a grown man?

34:05.760 --> 34:06.760
How much would you pay to not?

34:06.760 --> 34:07.760
Wait, don't.

34:07.760 --> 34:08.760
Don't answer that.

34:08.760 --> 34:09.760
We're going to hold you, motherfuckers, hostage.

34:09.760 --> 34:15.680
How much would you pay to not let my brother lick his butt?

34:15.680 --> 34:17.440
Guys I'm- Save me for myself.

34:17.440 --> 34:18.440
He's a broken man.

34:18.440 --> 34:21.160
I'm going to credit where credit is due.

34:21.160 --> 34:27.360
These are fucking extremely dirty.

34:27.360 --> 34:30.560
Number 21, masturbate into a shot glass.

34:30.560 --> 34:31.620
Real thing!

34:31.620 --> 34:33.240
Someone said on Yahoo!

34:33.240 --> 34:34.240
Yahoo!

34:34.240 --> 34:37.560
Masturbate into a shot glass for me.

34:37.560 --> 34:42.640
I don't know much, Griffin, but is there not a second half of that dare?

34:42.640 --> 34:44.840
Number three- Why would you?

34:44.840 --> 34:45.840
Okay.

34:45.840 --> 34:46.840
Nope.

34:46.840 --> 34:47.840
No, no, no, no, no.

34:47.840 --> 34:48.840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

34:48.840 --> 34:49.840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

34:49.840 --> 34:50.840
Back out.

34:50.840 --> 34:56.980
My issue with the question answer is not that they did not generate some extremely dirty

34:56.980 --> 34:58.580
truth or dares.

34:58.580 --> 35:00.960
It's a question of editing.

35:00.960 --> 35:05.880
Once you've created these masterpieces of dirty truth or dare, how do you leave something

35:05.880 --> 35:08.600
like Who Would You Like to Kiss?

35:08.600 --> 35:14.440
The problem with the great, what separates a good super dirty truth or dare creator from

35:14.440 --> 35:18.840
a great super dirty truth or dare creator is being able to separate your wheat from

35:18.840 --> 35:21.360
your chaff.

35:21.360 --> 35:29.760
I dare you to separate your wheat from your chaff and then lick it and let us watch.

35:29.760 --> 35:30.760
No others?

35:30.760 --> 35:37.200
I mean, there's fucking 60 of them and they keep jumping back and forth to like, kiss

35:37.200 --> 35:40.240
whoever you want in the room to number 30.

35:40.240 --> 35:41.840
This one's a partner dare.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.400
Have a blow job race.

35:43.400 --> 35:44.400
Fuck.

35:44.400 --> 35:48.160
I'm picking the guy who I think is going to come fastest.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.500
Get over here in 30 seconds, Jake.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.360
This is a different game.

35:52.360 --> 35:56.520
This is truth or dare or eyes wide shut.

35:56.520 --> 35:57.520
We love it.

35:57.520 --> 35:58.520
We love Ellie.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.520
We love it.

35:59.520 --> 36:00.520
It's true.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.520
It's true.

36:01.520 --> 36:02.520
Oh my God.

36:02.520 --> 36:03.520
Are you okay?

36:03.520 --> 36:04.520
Yeah.

36:04.520 --> 36:05.520
Oh no.

36:05.520 --> 36:08.880
The mutation started much earlier than we expected.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.080
Hey, hey everyone.

36:11.080 --> 36:13.520
Justin, welcome back to the podcast.

36:13.520 --> 36:21.920
This is the first time I've done anything sort of that even resembles work or not work.

36:21.920 --> 36:25.600
What is it contributing to society in other ways than like forming the next great generation

36:25.600 --> 36:27.520
of humanity?

36:27.520 --> 36:29.560
What generation is your baby in?

36:29.560 --> 36:31.560
Is it like, are we up to like omega?

36:31.560 --> 36:32.560
32 bit.

36:32.560 --> 36:33.560
Epsilon?

36:33.560 --> 36:34.560
Okay.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.600
Your baby, your baby do it and then don't is what you're saying.

36:37.600 --> 36:38.840
That's basically what I'm saying.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.960
You are not ready is what I'm saying.

36:41.960 --> 36:47.360
Listen, just because we, uh, I'm not here doesn't mean I don't need money.

36:47.360 --> 36:52.240
I have a mouth to feed and uh, you know what I'm going to be feeding my baby, but that's

36:52.240 --> 36:53.240
right.

36:53.240 --> 36:54.240
Nature box.

36:54.240 --> 36:58.040
She is not ready for, I'm just saying to the nature box offers a delicious catalog of delicious

36:58.040 --> 36:59.480
healthy food stuffs.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.960
She's probably not ready to chew down on some dark cocoa almonds.

37:01.960 --> 37:04.280
I think you're not ready cause I am.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.280
I have teeth.

37:05.280 --> 37:06.960
I have human adult teeth.

37:06.960 --> 37:13.600
Oh, but you don't like a lot of sugar and you don't like trans fats and you don't like

37:13.600 --> 37:15.000
high fructose corn syrup.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
That's all true.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Okay.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.480
Then you're ready for nature box.

37:19.480 --> 37:23.480
They've got delicious snacks, uh, that you go on, you pick the ones that look good to

37:23.480 --> 37:24.480
you.

37:24.480 --> 37:28.680
They have, I mean an insane amount of, of different varietals, varietals of snacks.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.140
Are any of them pre-chewed?

37:30.140 --> 37:31.140
Like don't get me wrong.

37:31.140 --> 37:35.920
Peanut butter nom noms, delicious baked sweet potato fries, fuck yes, but your baby's not

37:35.920 --> 37:38.880
going to be able to enjoy these in the way that they're meant to be enjoyed for another

37:38.880 --> 37:39.880
like three years or so.

37:39.880 --> 37:40.880
Okay.

37:40.880 --> 37:42.440
I'm going to hit you with a few that they have.

37:42.440 --> 37:43.440
Okay.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.680
And you can tell me if it's appropriate for the baby.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.680
Okay.

37:46.680 --> 37:49.680
Uh, baked sweet potato fries.

37:49.680 --> 37:50.680
No.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.760
Um, yogurt covered pretzels.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.360
Oh, actually that one.

37:54.360 --> 37:55.360
Yeah.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.360
Okay.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.360
That one's okay.

37:57.360 --> 37:58.360
Babies, babies love pretzels.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.360
Breast milk guzzlers.

37:59.360 --> 38:02.640
That sounds, actually that sounds all right.

38:02.640 --> 38:03.980
That one would be okay.

38:03.980 --> 38:08.000
Can I order those, can I order those or am I going to be put on some sort of watch list?

38:08.000 --> 38:14.960
Uh, if you go to naturebox.com, you can get 50% off of your first month's box.

38:14.960 --> 38:19.760
You go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

38:19.760 --> 38:20.760
That is the key thing.

38:20.760 --> 38:21.760
You can't get that original address.

38:21.760 --> 38:26.760
You go to naturebox.com slash my brother, all one word, and you can get 50% off your

38:26.760 --> 38:27.880
first month's box.

38:27.880 --> 38:28.880
Try them.

38:28.880 --> 38:33.020
A ton of our listeners have, and they've really, really liked them.

38:33.020 --> 38:34.200
They very much enjoyed them.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.320
We get emails all the time like, I'm full and healthy.

38:37.320 --> 38:39.880
I'm full and healthy, brothers.

38:39.880 --> 38:40.880
Thank you.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.680
Um, once you have managed to get your body-

38:42.680 --> 38:46.560
It's me, the mole man, your favorite listener.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.240
I'm Adam Sandler, the mole man.

38:49.240 --> 38:50.560
I live under the ground.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.600
I'm the Adam Sandler of the mole man.

38:52.600 --> 38:56.360
Man, you've just been, it's like falling off a log, isn't it, Juice?

38:56.360 --> 38:57.360
Comedy is easy.

38:57.360 --> 38:59.240
Parenthood is hard.

38:59.240 --> 39:00.240
That's my new book.

39:00.240 --> 39:02.320
Me and Irma Baumbacher co-writing it.

39:02.320 --> 39:03.320
That's coming out.

39:03.320 --> 39:08.200
Dave Barry, Justin McElroy presents, comedy is easy, parenthood is hard, and on the front

39:08.200 --> 39:11.600
it's me in a smoking jacket and he's behind me juggling a baby.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.440
We are changing our schedule now.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.520
We are only going to record one episode every nine and a half months.

39:17.520 --> 39:20.520
You're going to keep having babies, and then we're going to fucking get you on here for

39:20.520 --> 39:23.600
that prime material, that prime time.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.840
Here's a joke I wrote about fatherhood last night.

39:25.840 --> 39:26.840
Okay.

39:26.840 --> 39:31.880
I don't know why everybody's in such a hurry to teach their kids to talk, because it makes

39:31.880 --> 39:35.640
it so much harder to frame them for farting.

39:35.640 --> 39:36.640
That's pretty good.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.640
Thanks.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.120
I'll be honest, that's about exactly what I expected.

39:40.120 --> 39:41.120
Perfect.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.120
Okay.

39:42.120 --> 39:44.660
Well, that's about where I am in my life right now.

39:44.660 --> 39:50.120
I guess if you want jokes maybe better than that, you can probably find them on Hulu,

39:50.120 --> 39:52.940
Hulu Plus to be specific.

39:52.940 --> 39:57.340
It's like the Hulu reviews on your computer, only you can do it anywhere, anytime at your

39:57.340 --> 40:02.840
whim whenever you don't shackle yourself to your MacBook.

40:02.840 --> 40:08.200
You can get on your Roku, your Apple TV, your sex box, whatever you want, and just watch

40:08.200 --> 40:10.680
Hulu on the go.

40:10.680 --> 40:14.920
They got current season episodes of your favorite shows like Modern Family.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.640
They got Daily Show with Jon Stewart.

40:16.640 --> 40:23.640
They have every episode of shows like South Park, which is only available on Hulu Plus.

40:23.640 --> 40:25.480
You can do it how you like.

40:25.480 --> 40:26.480
Oh, fuck.

40:26.480 --> 40:27.480
Justin.

40:27.480 --> 40:28.480
Griffin.

40:28.480 --> 40:30.320
I have the best news ever.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.320
Tell me.

40:31.320 --> 40:33.800
And it's germane to Hulu Plus, because that is where I enjoy it.

40:33.800 --> 40:37.000
Okay, tell me about this entertainment you're enjoying.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.040
You know how the house has seemed very empty lately?

40:41.040 --> 40:42.960
The house has seemed hollow?

40:42.960 --> 40:44.800
That's what everybody's saying.

40:44.800 --> 40:48.880
People are always saying the house seems very hollow, and I think it's just because for

40:48.880 --> 40:53.360
a few months now, there haven't been any boys in the house.

40:53.360 --> 40:54.800
Boys in the house.

40:54.800 --> 40:58.680
It is right back where it needs to be.

40:58.680 --> 41:00.480
Cycle 21.

41:00.480 --> 41:03.920
Boys are back in the house for America's Next Top Model.

41:03.920 --> 41:10.160
Fucking Cory, so tight, he is now a judge, well not a judge, but he's like a host.

41:10.160 --> 41:13.720
He was this super sweet dude who in the first episode, they were like, boys on one side,

41:13.720 --> 41:14.720
girls on the other side.

41:14.720 --> 41:15.720
Boys pick a girl and walk down the stairs.

41:15.720 --> 41:19.040
And he walked towards the girls, and he's like, no, this will not do.

41:19.040 --> 41:21.200
And he turned around, and he got himself a boy.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.200
And they walked down the stairs.

41:22.200 --> 41:23.200
And you're telling me he's back?

41:23.200 --> 41:26.520
He's back, and he's a fucking judge, he's not a judge, he's a host.

41:26.520 --> 41:30.520
So he'll talk to them and be like, aw man, I've been there, you guys look fucking amazing.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.480
He's like super sweet, super supportive.

41:32.480 --> 41:37.000
Anyway, boys are back in the house, Cycle 21, check it out, Hulu Plus.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.560
It's only $7.99 a month.

41:38.560 --> 41:39.560
That's a great deal.

41:39.560 --> 41:42.600
It is a good deal, but the better deal is we can get you two weeks free.

41:42.600 --> 41:45.480
Two week free trial, it's longer than the usual one week free trial.

41:45.480 --> 41:49.840
We're gonna give you that extra week, just go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother, and you'll

41:49.840 --> 41:53.920
get that two week free trial, and it's good for us, because they know that we sent you,

41:53.920 --> 41:56.580
and they will continue to support my brother, my brother, and me.

41:56.580 --> 41:57.580
So it's a...

41:57.580 --> 41:58.960
And my infant daughter.

41:58.960 --> 42:01.440
And Justin's infant daughter, and my infant niece.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.440
Same person.

42:02.440 --> 42:03.440
Same person, it's the same one.

42:03.440 --> 42:08.960
I wanna give a very happy message to Yohan.

42:08.960 --> 42:13.140
It comes from Candace, Chris, Noah, Rachel, and Olivia.

42:13.140 --> 42:17.480
They say, hey Yohan, congratulations on finally being legal.

42:17.480 --> 42:21.140
We're so proud of you for everything you do in terms of hard work and training, as well

42:21.140 --> 42:23.000
as being a stellar guy in general.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.980
This fucking sounds like code.

42:24.980 --> 42:29.000
This sounds like they're hinting around some secret government skunk works, black ops shit.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
Are they activating Yohan's wet works protocol?

42:33.000 --> 42:37.960
We honestly couldn't ask for a better friend, and that's in quotation marks, and italics,

42:37.960 --> 42:38.960
and underlined, and bolded.

42:38.960 --> 42:40.940
And there's a bunch of upside down triangles in it.

42:40.940 --> 42:43.800
So we hope that a special shout- Is that Illuminati?

42:43.800 --> 42:45.440
It's maybe the Illuminati.

42:45.440 --> 42:48.640
We hope that a special shout-out from the Brothers Mackerel will make your day.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.320
Happy 18th birthday.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.320
We love you.

42:51.320 --> 42:56.900
Has anyone ever made a porn called Illuminati, like the word naughty, and it's like a bunch

42:56.900 --> 43:02.760
of people in robes, and maybe some of them are lizards, and then they fuck?

43:02.760 --> 43:04.560
I would watch the hell out of that.

43:04.560 --> 43:05.560
Yeah, of course you would.

43:05.560 --> 43:08.000
From an academic kind of perspective?

43:08.000 --> 43:11.920
Yeah, and also you're a stonemason.

43:11.920 --> 43:13.600
Happy birthday, Yohan.

43:13.600 --> 43:14.600
We're very proud of you.

43:14.600 --> 43:15.600
We're so proud.

43:15.600 --> 43:16.920
You're living so right.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.980
Got another birthday for Emily Brunston.

43:19.980 --> 43:21.200
You have a birthday for her?

43:21.200 --> 43:23.480
I have a birthday for her, to offer her.

43:23.480 --> 43:24.920
Please accept this birthday, Emily Brunston.

43:24.920 --> 43:27.400
It's from Avital and Julien.

43:27.400 --> 43:32.560
Avital, maybe Avital, it's a lovely name.

43:32.560 --> 43:33.560
I'm sure.

43:33.560 --> 43:36.320
However you interpret it- However you say it, you can't mess that one

43:36.320 --> 43:37.320
up.

43:37.320 --> 43:38.320
Avital.

43:38.320 --> 43:39.320
You can't fuck that name up.

43:39.320 --> 43:40.320
Avital.

43:40.320 --> 43:41.640
Any way you say it, it's beautiful.

43:41.640 --> 43:45.920
Happy birthday, Dumbleton's dog, sending this message is cheaper than buying people off

43:45.920 --> 43:50.640
to ensure that Mad Men ends in a full-blown orgy like you richly deserve.

43:50.640 --> 43:54.440
Instead of measuring the next year in love, which is weak and filthy, may you measure it

43:54.440 --> 43:59.480
in delicious dips, corgis, and days at the office without a visit from ProBot, the probing

43:59.480 --> 44:00.680
robot.

44:00.680 --> 44:05.040
And I think there was a series of- I would assume in-jokes there?

44:05.040 --> 44:08.360
I think they're not- No, ProBot's a thing.

44:08.360 --> 44:09.360
ProBot's a thing?

44:09.360 --> 44:10.360
Yeah, you said- Is that a-

44:10.360 --> 44:15.000
There's a robot that just like gets in there and like makes sure everything's okay.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.040
What about corgis?

44:17.040 --> 44:18.200
Those are fake.

44:18.200 --> 44:19.200
Those are fake, okay.

44:19.200 --> 44:22.040
I knew that there was something messed up in there.

44:22.040 --> 44:23.120
Happy birthday, Emily.

44:23.120 --> 44:24.600
We hope it's a great one.

44:24.600 --> 44:28.080
Yeah, we're very, very happy for you.

44:28.080 --> 44:30.080
It sounds like you have a pretty sick life.

44:30.080 --> 44:31.080
Sick in a good way.

44:31.080 --> 44:32.080
Sick in a good way.

44:32.080 --> 44:34.440
Should we do some like housekeeping?

44:34.440 --> 44:39.240
Thank you all for- We got so much amazing feedback for the Adventure Zone, the D&D episode

44:39.240 --> 44:41.400
we did last week.

44:41.400 --> 44:45.120
We're gonna figure out a way to continue doing those.

44:45.120 --> 44:52.240
Not I think- I mean, based on what we talked about, not on the Mabim Bam feed, as it were.

44:52.240 --> 44:53.800
You think this is all safe to talk about?

44:53.800 --> 44:55.080
Yeah, I think so.

44:55.080 --> 44:58.440
This is our plans as they stand right now.

44:58.440 --> 45:01.280
Not a Mabim Bam thing, but maybe a separate thing?

45:01.280 --> 45:02.280
Maybe.

45:02.280 --> 45:03.280
Maybe?

45:03.280 --> 45:04.280
People seem to like it.

45:04.280 --> 45:05.280
We're figuring it out.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.280
We're figuring it out.

45:06.280 --> 45:09.200
So, yeah, thank you all for the feedback.

45:09.200 --> 45:12.200
There's actually in the Facebook group, which I don't know if you've been on there recently,

45:12.200 --> 45:14.160
has been like popping off.

45:14.160 --> 45:15.160
Go check it out.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.760
We're usually pretty quick about letting people in.

45:16.760 --> 45:22.000
It's a closed group, so haters can't just hop in.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
Sometimes spammers- Spammers do.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
They trick me.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
They trick us to get in and kick them out, though.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.800
But yeah, there's actually a lot of really good feedback on what we could do better.

45:30.800 --> 45:33.540
Some good ideas for what a D&D podcast could be.

45:33.540 --> 45:35.900
So thank you all very, very, very much for that.

45:35.900 --> 45:37.480
Hope you're enjoying the LA live show.

45:37.480 --> 45:39.040
It was a hoot.

45:39.040 --> 45:42.040
We're figuring out our plans for next year.

45:42.040 --> 45:43.040
We're going to do- Spoiler alert.

45:43.040 --> 45:47.440
We're going to do a shit ton of live shows in 2015.

45:47.440 --> 45:49.080
Basically all over this beautiful nation of ours.

45:49.080 --> 45:50.680
So look forward to that.

45:50.680 --> 45:52.880
Do you think we'll be back?

45:52.880 --> 45:54.400
We'll probably be back next week, right?

45:54.400 --> 45:55.400
I would imagine.

45:55.400 --> 45:56.400
Yeah.

45:56.400 --> 45:59.360
My baby can't hold my attention for that long.

45:59.360 --> 46:00.360
That's true.

46:00.360 --> 46:02.440
Especially with all these fucking dad jokes.

46:02.440 --> 46:03.920
I am cooking up for you.

46:03.920 --> 46:04.920
Yeah.

46:04.920 --> 46:05.920
I am in heat right now.

46:05.920 --> 46:06.920
I am in bad joke heat.

46:06.920 --> 46:07.920
We can't waste a second of this.

46:07.920 --> 46:08.920
All right.

46:08.920 --> 46:13.800
Well, we're going to get back to the show, but thank you all for being so wonderful.

46:13.800 --> 46:18.160
And yeah, more episodes, more regular stuff next week.

46:18.160 --> 46:19.160
God bless.

46:19.160 --> 46:20.160
God bless.

46:20.160 --> 46:21.160
Hashtag bless.

46:21.160 --> 46:22.160
Hey, Griffin, you could tilt your mic down a little bit.

46:22.160 --> 46:23.160
Yeah, I'm really having to get up on it.

46:23.160 --> 46:24.160
Just like angle it.

46:24.160 --> 46:25.160
There we go.

46:25.160 --> 46:26.160
Oh, if only.

46:26.160 --> 46:27.160
Here we go.

46:27.160 --> 46:28.160
What?

46:28.160 --> 46:29.160
Who's laughing?

46:29.160 --> 46:30.160
Oh, like a dick thing?

46:30.160 --> 46:31.160
Oh, like a dick thing?

46:31.160 --> 46:32.160
Oh, like a dick thing?

46:32.160 --> 46:33.160
Oh, like a dick thing?

46:33.160 --> 46:34.160
Oh, like a dick thing?

46:34.160 --> 46:35.160
Oh, like a dick thing?

46:35.160 --> 46:36.160
Oh, like a dick thing, guys.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.160
It was a dick thing.

46:37.160 --> 46:38.160
Great.

46:38.160 --> 46:39.480
No, it was actually very good.

46:39.480 --> 46:40.480
Well done.

46:40.480 --> 46:42.520
How about another question?

46:42.520 --> 46:43.520
When did we start?

46:43.520 --> 46:44.520
Hey, let's take a question from the audience.

46:44.520 --> 46:45.520
Yeah, what time did we start?

46:45.520 --> 46:46.520
Should we?

46:46.520 --> 46:47.520
Who's got like a great question?

46:47.520 --> 46:48.520
Well, hold on.

46:48.520 --> 46:49.520
You got to be quicker on the draw.

46:49.520 --> 46:50.520
Drew Davenport, do you have a question?

46:50.520 --> 46:51.520
Yeah.

46:51.520 --> 46:52.520
Sorry, fuck everybody else.

46:52.520 --> 46:53.520
Drew Davenport, get back up here.

46:53.520 --> 46:54.520
All right.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.520
Griffin has a glass.

46:55.520 --> 47:00.520
He doesn't get to keep the can, too.

47:00.520 --> 47:04.960
Come on now.

47:04.960 --> 47:05.960
I need a...

47:05.960 --> 47:06.960
We got to conserve our rations.

47:06.960 --> 47:07.960
We're in a riot situation.

47:07.960 --> 47:08.960
Hey, everybody.

47:08.960 --> 47:09.960
It's Drew Davenport.

47:09.960 --> 47:10.960
Woo.

47:10.960 --> 47:11.960
Yeah, there you go.

47:11.960 --> 47:12.960
Angle it up, you giant man.

47:12.960 --> 47:13.960
Yeah.

47:13.960 --> 47:14.960
And turn it a little bit so you can face it.

47:14.960 --> 47:15.960
Yeah.

47:15.960 --> 47:16.960
Look at us now.

47:16.960 --> 47:17.960
Now make eye contact with Griffin.

47:17.960 --> 47:18.960
Look at me now.

47:18.960 --> 47:19.960
Me only.

47:19.960 --> 47:20.960
Go ahead.

47:20.960 --> 47:25.000
Drew, it's just me and you.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.440
Open your heart and let us climb inside, Drew.

47:28.440 --> 47:31.960
This is from a conversation I had on the way here with my girlfriend.

47:31.960 --> 47:32.960
Terrific.

47:32.960 --> 47:37.000
Is it okay to put groceries in a truck bed and drive home?

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Oh, no.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
It's not.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
No.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
It depends.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Wait.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
Wait.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
What groceries?

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Yeah.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.320
If it's a Lean Cuisine, a Lean Cuisine is a little self-preserved little pocket of amazing

47:49.320 --> 47:50.320
food.

47:50.320 --> 47:53.800
If you put a head of lettuce in there, it's going to be gone by the time you get home.

47:53.800 --> 47:56.200
Just the microbes in the air will just dissolve it.

47:56.200 --> 47:57.200
Yeah.

47:57.200 --> 47:58.840
And rinse food, sack of potatoes.

47:58.840 --> 48:01.400
Sack of potatoes, that's okay.

48:01.400 --> 48:03.320
The flowery foods and artichoke.

48:03.320 --> 48:04.320
Paper towel roll.

48:04.320 --> 48:05.320
No, no, no.

48:05.320 --> 48:06.320
Your towel roll is done.

48:06.320 --> 48:09.420
Except flowery foods, except flour because if that bursts back there, that's your week.

48:09.420 --> 48:10.420
That's your whole week at that point.

48:10.420 --> 48:11.420
That's your week.

48:11.420 --> 48:12.720
You are no longer driving.

48:12.720 --> 48:13.800
You are making a rue.

48:13.800 --> 48:16.520
Do you own a truck?

48:16.520 --> 48:17.520
She owns a truck.

48:17.520 --> 48:18.520
She owns a truck?

48:18.520 --> 48:19.520
It's her truck.

48:19.520 --> 48:20.520
Don't.

48:20.520 --> 48:21.520
Well, don't.

48:21.520 --> 48:22.520
I think she gets to call the shots here, Drew.

48:22.520 --> 48:24.640
Drew, wait.

48:24.640 --> 48:26.200
Are you pro or against?

48:26.200 --> 48:28.200
Oh, I'm pro.

48:28.200 --> 48:33.760
You want to put your food out in... Hold on, just so I'm clear, if I took all the food

48:33.760 --> 48:39.360
that you have in your house and I somehow held it in my giant arms, and then I ran down

48:39.360 --> 48:44.480
the street at 55 miles an hour for, I don't know, 45 minutes, and then I came back to

48:44.480 --> 48:48.600
your house and I said, eat all this now, you would be like, yum, yum, give me some.

48:48.600 --> 48:49.600
Can we... Wait, hold on.

48:49.600 --> 48:50.600
One more again.

48:50.600 --> 48:54.960
Can we jump back to 30 seconds ago when we loved Drew?

48:54.960 --> 49:00.880
I love Drew and I want to keep him food safe and food smart.

49:00.880 --> 49:04.480
Everything in there's got E. coli, it's got bird flu, it's got bird shit on it.

49:04.480 --> 49:05.600
It's probably got birds.

49:05.600 --> 49:06.920
It's got live birds in there.

49:06.920 --> 49:08.120
You got a bad case of birds.

49:08.120 --> 49:09.120
You got birds.

49:09.120 --> 49:11.920
Plastic bags, you tie up.

49:11.920 --> 49:14.840
That's not... Yeah, Drew, that was our problem the whole time, Drew.

49:14.840 --> 49:17.960
You really uncorked it.

49:17.960 --> 49:21.420
Did you see that virus... What we thought of bags.

49:21.420 --> 49:26.720
That virus movie where Gwyneth Paltrow got fucking wrecked in the first 15 minutes, and

49:26.720 --> 49:30.520
they were like, guys, don't worry, just get some plastic grocery bags and just wrap that

49:30.520 --> 49:35.280
around your shit for 15 minutes, and the movie was a half hour long because that fixed it.

49:35.280 --> 49:36.280
That did it.

49:36.280 --> 49:39.360
That was how that movie ended.

49:39.360 --> 49:40.360
Super quick, don't even think about it.

49:40.360 --> 49:43.440
Tell me the dirtiest thing you've ever put in your truck bed, go.

49:43.440 --> 49:44.440
I don't have a truck.

49:44.440 --> 49:48.560
Okay, the dirtiest thing that your girlfriend's ever put in her truck bed.

49:48.560 --> 49:49.560
Help him.

49:49.560 --> 49:50.560
Dearest.

49:50.560 --> 49:51.560
A carcass?

49:51.560 --> 49:52.560
An animal carcass?

49:52.560 --> 49:53.560
An animal carcass?

49:53.560 --> 49:54.560
I just assumed.

49:54.560 --> 49:55.560
You a big deer hunter?

49:55.560 --> 49:56.560
I'm stigmatizing.

49:56.560 --> 49:57.560
Oh, God.

49:57.560 --> 49:58.560
What?

49:58.560 --> 49:59.560
That's everything you... Okay.

49:59.560 --> 50:00.560
Worse than dead deer.

50:00.560 --> 50:01.560
When was this?

50:01.560 --> 50:02.560
Give me a rough timeline.

50:02.560 --> 50:03.560
When was this?

50:03.560 --> 50:09.680
Okay, so for six months, you've been eating couch Craigslist food.

50:09.680 --> 50:14.240
You've been eating the ass of the person you bought the couch from on Craigslist.

50:14.240 --> 50:15.240
Is that okay?

50:15.240 --> 50:16.880
Imagine the dirtiest person you could think of.

50:16.880 --> 50:19.520
This salad is crazy.

50:19.520 --> 50:23.560
It tastes... It's not... Do I detect a hint of Craigslist ass?

50:23.560 --> 50:28.560
It's not good, but it's not bad.

50:28.560 --> 50:29.560
It was cheap.

50:29.560 --> 50:36.000
Imagine the dirtiest stranger you ever met reached underneath their couch and retrieved

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
a Hot Pocket.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Yeah.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.040
They then handed that Hot Pocket to you and said, here, stupid.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.040
Eat this.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.480
Eat these Craigslist croutons.

50:44.480 --> 50:46.400
Yeah, absolutely.

50:46.400 --> 50:47.400
This is great.

50:47.400 --> 50:51.400
I'm so excited about eating this that you've retrieved from me.

50:51.400 --> 50:52.720
That's been six months for you.

50:52.720 --> 50:55.080
That's six months.

50:55.080 --> 50:57.240
I fucking hugged you earlier.

50:57.240 --> 50:59.240
That was a bond of trust.

50:59.240 --> 51:04.360
I hugged you, trusting that you didn't have Craigslist mouth.

51:04.360 --> 51:05.360
That's where we are.

51:05.360 --> 51:06.360
These are all hypotheticals.

51:06.360 --> 51:07.360
Yeah.

51:07.360 --> 51:09.680
Oh, well, then it's totally... Oh, well, then I guess we're fine.

51:09.680 --> 51:10.680
I guess we're cool.

51:10.680 --> 51:11.680
Don't worry.

51:11.680 --> 51:12.680
Good job, Drew.

51:12.680 --> 51:13.680
Everybody, Drew Davenport.

51:13.680 --> 51:16.680
Drew Davenport, fucking savior of the podcast.

51:16.680 --> 51:24.920
Where did that full anger go?

51:24.920 --> 51:25.920
Regular question.

51:25.920 --> 51:26.920
Here we go.

51:26.920 --> 51:27.920
Pop it back.

51:27.920 --> 51:28.920
I got a real-ass question.

51:28.920 --> 51:29.920
Corinne, are you here?

51:29.920 --> 51:30.920
Corinne?

51:30.920 --> 51:31.920
Can we keep the chatter down in the audience, maybe, for this?

51:31.920 --> 51:32.920
It's our show, not yours.

51:32.920 --> 51:33.920
We're trying to do a show up here.

51:33.920 --> 51:34.920
Corinne?

51:34.920 --> 51:35.920
Okay.

51:35.920 --> 51:36.920
All right.

51:36.920 --> 51:37.920
Okay, she's here.

51:37.920 --> 51:38.920
Raise your hand, Corinne.

51:38.920 --> 51:39.920
Corinne says, you don't have to come down.

51:39.920 --> 51:40.920
You don't have to come down.

51:40.920 --> 51:41.920
Yeah, she's coming.

51:41.920 --> 51:42.920
That's fine.

51:42.920 --> 51:43.920
No, okay.

51:43.920 --> 51:44.920
You're halfway.

51:44.920 --> 51:45.920
No, no, come on out, Corinne.

51:45.920 --> 51:46.920
Come on down.

51:46.920 --> 51:47.920
Stand in the aisle for the whole time.

51:47.920 --> 51:48.920
No, Corinne.

51:48.920 --> 51:49.920
No, come here.

51:49.920 --> 51:50.920
Come up to the microphone.

51:50.920 --> 51:51.920
I'm fucking with you.

51:51.920 --> 51:54.920
Corinne, this is one of those questions that you did not give us nearly enough details.

51:54.920 --> 51:55.920
Okay, Travis, go.

51:55.920 --> 51:56.920
Well-

51:56.920 --> 51:57.920
Corinne writes.

51:57.920 --> 51:58.920
This is perfect because she's like five feet away.

51:58.920 --> 51:59.920
Yeah.

51:59.920 --> 52:00.920
Just move your mouth up and down, Corinne.

52:00.920 --> 52:01.920
Let's try this.

52:01.920 --> 52:02.920
This will be great.

52:02.920 --> 52:08.800
I teach in an art school and I hate all my students.

52:08.800 --> 52:12.920
Let's not say, hey, let's make a pact not to say Corinne's last name.

52:12.920 --> 52:13.920
Yay.

52:13.920 --> 52:14.920
Yay.

52:14.920 --> 52:16.360
I hate my students.

52:16.360 --> 52:17.600
Super best, Corinne.

52:17.600 --> 52:23.160
I have to say, Corinne's in a bad situation because if you want to not curry favor with

52:23.160 --> 52:25.200
me, here's the number one thing you do.

52:25.200 --> 52:30.000
You give me art and then you ask me what I think of it.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.560
You know the only art I like?

52:31.560 --> 52:34.600
Wayne's World, the movie.

52:34.600 --> 52:35.600
I haven't liked-

52:35.600 --> 52:38.440
And Wayne's World, the movie-related art.

52:38.440 --> 52:43.160
If you want to give me a framed cell from the original cut of Wayne's World, I'd be

52:43.160 --> 52:44.160
into that.

52:44.160 --> 52:47.360
Can you give us an age window to imagineer with?

52:47.360 --> 52:50.880
I teach at a private college.

52:50.880 --> 52:51.880
Like adult?

52:51.880 --> 52:52.880
Yes.

52:52.880 --> 52:55.640
Not like six-year-olds at which point you go, yeah, this is great, there you do that.

52:55.640 --> 52:56.640
Yeah, it's totally hateful.

52:56.640 --> 52:58.640
Like adults, you can go, no, shit.

52:58.640 --> 53:00.360
Can we get some detail on what it is?

53:00.360 --> 53:01.360
Is it a-

53:01.360 --> 53:02.360
Nude class?

53:02.360 --> 53:03.360
No, come on.

53:03.360 --> 53:04.360
Actually, I do.

53:04.360 --> 53:05.360
I do teach life drawing.

53:05.360 --> 53:08.480
That's one of the classes I teach.

53:08.480 --> 53:09.800
Is that kind of why you hate them?

53:09.800 --> 53:13.400
Because there's obviously some dudes getting there with some future jerk material.

53:13.400 --> 53:14.400
Do they woo?

53:14.400 --> 53:15.400
Do they woo?

53:15.400 --> 53:16.400
Do they woo?

53:16.400 --> 53:17.400
Like they're on the fucking set of Saved by the Bell?

53:17.400 --> 53:18.400
I don't think-

53:18.400 --> 53:19.400
Like, yahoo!

53:19.400 --> 53:25.760
I'm pretty sure if you yahoo, you are asked to leave.

53:25.760 --> 53:27.760
Corinne's feelings on you as a person have no-

53:27.760 --> 53:29.120
There's not a three strike policy.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.400
No, I'm pretty sure.

53:30.400 --> 53:31.400
Steve, and you've won sports.

53:31.400 --> 53:32.400
Neat bush!

53:32.400 --> 53:33.400
Keep it down.

53:33.400 --> 53:34.400
I'm sorry.

53:34.400 --> 53:35.400
I'm sorry, I need this.

53:35.400 --> 53:36.400
I just get so excited when I see-

53:36.400 --> 53:41.720
I get excited when I see a neat bush.

53:41.720 --> 53:42.720
Are we close?

53:42.720 --> 53:43.720
I'll be honest.

53:43.720 --> 53:44.720
We have many conversations in the beginning of class where I have to tell them, like,

53:44.720 --> 53:45.720
you know, if there is an erection or a fart or-

53:45.720 --> 53:46.720
I'm sorry.

53:46.720 --> 53:47.720
No, I just did the thing that you hate probably.

53:47.720 --> 53:48.720
And then, yahoo.

53:48.720 --> 53:49.720
Because, you know what I love?

53:49.720 --> 54:06.240
Is that you said erection, which is like such a proper way, or a fart, and that made me

54:06.240 --> 54:07.240
so happy.

54:07.240 --> 54:16.080
Corinne, if you can make farts not funny, I'm going to name you the president of magic.

54:16.080 --> 54:19.080
I will follow you around like fucking-

54:19.080 --> 54:20.640
And be fishers of men.

54:20.640 --> 54:21.640
Yeah, right.

54:21.640 --> 54:22.640
Exactly.

54:22.640 --> 54:25.680
I will win people to your cause, because you are a wizard.

54:25.680 --> 54:28.920
I tell them that farts are funny, and that's okay.

54:28.920 --> 54:33.000
If you need to laugh, like, just leave the room and laugh, and then come back in.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
Have you ever had any smart ass students that tried to-

54:36.000 --> 54:41.000
Tried to paint the fart, like, onomatopoetically?

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
Braap.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
Yeah.

54:43.000 --> 54:48.640
You've done really great work on the chest muscles here, Brett.

54:48.640 --> 54:50.920
You've done- you're really coming along as a student.

54:50.920 --> 54:54.840
You did make it say fart with five R's in, like-

54:54.840 --> 54:56.120
But the shading is spectacular.

54:56.120 --> 55:01.080
And the font was, like, a stinky green cloud, and that was- I'm not going to lie, like,

55:01.080 --> 55:03.680
it was a good stinky green cloud.

55:03.680 --> 55:09.600
It's just the subject matter of it was troubling Brett.

55:09.600 --> 55:10.600
Stop.

55:10.600 --> 55:11.600
This is my kryptonite.

55:11.600 --> 55:12.600
You're killing me.

55:12.600 --> 55:21.600
I mean, the most troublesome poses are when the model decides to do, like, Captain Morgan.

55:21.600 --> 55:22.600
Oh, okay.

55:22.600 --> 55:23.600
Yeah, right.

55:23.600 --> 55:24.600
Like a look-a-matang.

55:24.600 --> 55:25.600
Yeah.

55:25.600 --> 55:26.600
Or a-

55:26.600 --> 55:29.480
Well, it's actually typically women that take that pose.

55:29.480 --> 55:32.680
Men like to do, like, the drop down, let everything hang.

55:32.680 --> 55:33.680
The touchdown dance.

55:33.680 --> 55:34.680
The touchdown dance.

55:34.680 --> 55:35.680
Yeah.

55:35.680 --> 55:36.680
I'd like to do the cover-em-ups.

55:36.680 --> 55:38.440
Is that a pose that's-

55:38.440 --> 55:42.520
I like to do the stay in the hallway and refuse to come in the room.

55:42.520 --> 55:43.520
I'm scared.

55:43.520 --> 55:44.520
I changed my mind.

55:44.520 --> 55:45.520
Is that a pose that's alright?

55:45.520 --> 55:46.520
I changed my mind.

55:46.520 --> 55:47.520
I do the-

55:47.520 --> 55:48.520
You can keep your $25.

55:48.520 --> 55:52.040
I do the why can't they just paint my jeans while I'm wearing them also.

55:52.040 --> 55:54.320
Why don't students need to get good at painting jeans?

55:54.320 --> 55:58.240
I do the aren't jeans art two.

55:58.240 --> 56:02.960
I've seen a lot of dong paintings, I haven't seen a lot of good jeans paintings.

56:02.960 --> 56:05.400
I don't think Van Gogh had a jeans phase.

56:05.400 --> 56:08.040
Let's tackle that subject next.

56:08.040 --> 56:10.480
Let's cross boundaries together with these dungarees.

56:10.480 --> 56:11.960
It's very avant-garde, yeah.

56:11.960 --> 56:12.960
Yeah.

56:12.960 --> 56:13.960
It's very avant-garde.

56:13.960 --> 56:14.960
So is that-

56:14.960 --> 56:17.440
Okay, we've been talking about dicks for, like, 30 minutes now.

56:17.440 --> 56:19.760
What is it that you actually don't, aren't so crazy about?

56:19.760 --> 56:23.000
Is it really dongs and erections and parts of it?

56:23.000 --> 56:29.760
There's just a lot of, you know, people don't want to be enthusiastic about things, and

56:29.760 --> 56:31.840
that makes you hate your students as a teacher.

56:31.840 --> 56:34.320
And I think that crosses all subject matter.

56:34.320 --> 56:36.040
Real quick, they're paying to be there, right?

56:36.040 --> 56:37.040
Yeah.

56:37.040 --> 56:38.040
They're paying a lot of money to be there.

56:38.040 --> 56:39.040
Yeah, that's gotta be fresh.

56:39.040 --> 56:40.040
Good work, everyone.

56:40.040 --> 56:41.040
Yeah, great job.

56:41.040 --> 56:42.040
Way to go, higher education.

56:42.040 --> 56:43.520
I could see how that would be frustrating.

56:43.520 --> 56:47.120
I would say, though, Crim, it might be a case of them just not want...

56:47.120 --> 56:53.160
I would be so terrified to just do it wrong or have people think that I looked at the

56:53.160 --> 56:54.160
naked person wrong.

56:54.160 --> 56:55.160
Yeah.

56:55.160 --> 56:56.160
Or looked at them too hard.

56:56.160 --> 56:57.240
Or too hard.

56:57.240 --> 56:58.840
I would be constantly averting my eyes.

56:58.840 --> 57:02.520
You would probably get a very disengaged vibe from me, I would think.

57:02.520 --> 57:03.520
Yeah.

57:03.520 --> 57:07.320
If I was in your class and you brought in a naked man that I would draw him, I would

57:07.320 --> 57:12.560
make it fleshy and smooth like a Ken doll down there, because I wouldn't know...

57:12.560 --> 57:13.560
That's a thing.

57:13.560 --> 57:14.560
You call that the Ken doll.

57:14.560 --> 57:15.560
Yeah.

57:15.560 --> 57:20.160
I would know if I was supposed to draw a dick, and if I did, then you'd be like, Crim, I'm

57:20.160 --> 57:22.160
very disappointed in you.

57:22.160 --> 57:29.200
Especially if it's just kind of a stick figure man, but a very precise, detailed dick.

57:29.200 --> 57:30.720
So maybe it's not that your students are...

57:30.720 --> 57:31.720
Really dead on.

57:31.720 --> 57:32.720
Right.

57:32.720 --> 57:33.720
Maybe it's not that your students...

57:33.720 --> 57:34.720
I could pick that out of a lineup.

57:34.720 --> 57:35.720
Sure.

57:35.720 --> 57:36.720
Dead eye dick.

57:36.720 --> 57:38.480
Maybe it's less of a case that your students aren't...

57:38.480 --> 57:39.480
Maybe your students aren't...

57:39.480 --> 57:42.480
Hold on, let me figure out the sentence structure.

57:42.480 --> 57:45.160
Okay, I think I've got it.

57:45.160 --> 57:49.160
Maybe your students are enthusiastic, they're just scared that they're gonna paint a dick

57:49.160 --> 57:50.360
and you'll be very disappointed in them.

57:50.360 --> 57:53.720
So maybe you need to be very explicitly clear about what it is that they're supposed to

57:53.720 --> 57:54.720
draw.

57:54.720 --> 57:55.720
Like...

57:55.720 --> 57:56.720
That I expect out of their penises.

57:56.720 --> 58:02.760
Yeah, just say like, if you wanna go like, bathing suit area out, up and down, start

58:02.760 --> 58:03.760
there.

58:03.760 --> 58:06.440
If you want to really explore the space and do what feels comfortable to you, if you wanna

58:06.440 --> 58:08.760
draw a dick, I'm not going to be disappointed in you.

58:08.760 --> 58:14.880
Griffin, great job.

58:14.880 --> 58:15.880
Some teaching tips.

58:15.880 --> 58:16.880
Thanks.

58:16.880 --> 58:17.880
That's the least we could do.

58:17.880 --> 58:18.880
Give a big hand for Corinne.

58:18.880 --> 58:19.880
Thank you, Corinne.

58:19.880 --> 58:20.880
Thank you.

58:20.880 --> 58:21.880
Got one of Yahoo Answers?

58:21.880 --> 58:22.880
Yeah.

58:22.880 --> 58:23.880
I'm into that.

58:23.880 --> 58:24.880
This Yahoo Answer was sent in by Alan Black.

58:24.880 --> 58:25.880
Thank you, Alan Black.

58:25.880 --> 58:26.880
A very prolific contributor.

58:26.880 --> 58:27.880
So this is by Yahoo Answers user, SlickNinja360, who asks...

58:27.880 --> 58:28.880
Should be good.

58:28.880 --> 58:29.880
Should be pretty good.

58:29.880 --> 58:30.880
Would it be illegal to go into the middle of a forest and build a maze for you?

58:30.880 --> 58:31.880
Yeah.

58:31.880 --> 58:32.880
Would it be illegal to go into the middle of a forest and build a maze for you?

58:32.880 --> 58:33.880
Yeah.

58:33.880 --> 58:34.880
Would it be illegal to go into the middle of a forest and build a maze for you?

58:34.880 --> 58:52.880
Yeah.

58:52.880 --> 58:53.880
I guess, yeah.

58:53.880 --> 58:54.880
I guess that's pretty good.

58:54.880 --> 58:55.880
Upon entry, the entrance would close.

58:55.880 --> 59:01.440
It would have spikes on the wall's tops to keep them from escaping.

59:01.440 --> 59:05.320
I was also thinking of having booby traps and things like that.

59:05.320 --> 59:08.440
Once they find the exit, they could leave.

59:08.440 --> 59:12.000
I don't know about illegal, but logistically it seems like an issue.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Yeah.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Yeah, you're gonna have to have some fucking...

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
Is it a motorized gate or like a magical...

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
Yeah.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
It grows over when they walk through.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.200
It's gonna be a fucking pan's labyrinth magic moss.

59:19.200 --> 59:25.740
I will say, if we can't fix gun laws, but we have been thorough enough to figure out

59:25.740 --> 59:31.000
our forest maze laws, I might be very disappointed in our nation.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
Yeah.

59:32.000 --> 59:37.800
If you own the land, and this is troubling because I'm agreeing with the top Yahoo response

59:37.800 --> 59:41.800
to this, but if you own the land, you can build a maze wherever the fuck you want.

59:41.800 --> 59:44.840
I don't know that you can corral people into it.

59:44.840 --> 59:46.960
That's where you run into...

59:46.960 --> 59:48.960
You can leave a trail of peppermints.

59:48.960 --> 59:50.320
There's no guarantee.

59:50.320 --> 59:53.760
This is the beautiful thing about it, if you force people to do it, highly illegal.

59:53.760 --> 59:54.760
Yeah.

59:54.760 --> 59:57.760
If you offer people the opportunity to do it, highly profitable.

59:57.760 --> 59:58.760
Yeah.

59:58.760 --> 01:00:03.000
It's not like I just bought a house and I feel like I have total agency over it.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.160
I do not think I can invite friends in and then lock the door and then swallow the key

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:11.560
and say, I will let you out as soon as you solve my puzzle of flesh.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.600
And then I would show them my flesh puzzle.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.080
Here's the funny thing about luring.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.080
I would bet...

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.440
Is the flesh puzzle your genitals?

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.440
That's my balls here.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.440
Okay.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.440
It's your balls.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:27.400
I would bet that 80 to 90% of the people in this room, if you stumbled upon what you were

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:32.320
guaranteed to be a solvable forest maze- That would lock you in and you would fucking

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.760
die if you couldn't solve it.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.880
If, that's a big if Griffin.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:36.880
How many of you would say?

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.880
All right.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.880
Yeah.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.880
I'll tackle this bitch.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:40.880
This is everything I've ever trained for.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.880
Yeah.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.880
Everybody raise your hand.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.400
If you stumbled upon a pan's labyrinth, you would not-

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.400
This is serious.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.400
Okay.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.400
There's a lot of people.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.400
I'm raising my hand.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.400
Okay.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.400
You would risk your life.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.440
All those years of playing Professor Layton games are finally going to pay off.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.680
You're going to solve this shit.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.680
Sherlock Holmes.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.680
All right.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.680
The Goblet of Fire.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.680
Yeah.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.680
The Goblet of Fire game.

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:01.680
It was so good.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.680
Well, you play it in your head where you go, I would have gone left.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.680
Yeah.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:06.680
I would have slain the basilisk.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.680
That's what you sound like.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.680
That was in book one, dick.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.680
Sorry.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.680
Two.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.680
Oh, shit.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.680
Fuck.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:13.680
Fuck.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:19.320
Keep it to yourselves.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.880
What would lure you into... Okay.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.520
What would lure me into a forest maze?

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:26.840
Doing the opening of a fucking forest maze.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.600
Right?

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.780
You got to.

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.200
What if it's risking your life, though?

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.480
I don't want... You know what?

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:38.720
The fourth verse of Tim McGraw's Live Like You Were Dying directly references, I went

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:43.760
into every forest maze I saw, I think.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:51.640
I heard a pan flute beckoning me in, but there was gold doubloons at the end.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:57.360
Bite traps weren't scared me wide.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.640
Have you ever heard that song?

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.200
Have you ever heard the song?

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.700
I'm not great with melodies.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.200
That's actually... I was singing the harmony.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.120
I thought someone would join in.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.120
What else we got?

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.120
Let's do another audience question.

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.120
Yeah.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.120
How about another... Oh, fuck.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.120
There's something about people being in the front row.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.120
It's very intimidating.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.120
Come on up.

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:17.120
You're on the front.

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.120
Yeah.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.120
We'll do a front row.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.120
Wait.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.120
You raised your hand.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.120
You raised your hand.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.120
You can't say shit when we pick you.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.120
Shit.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.120
Me?

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.120
You walked into this forest maze.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.120
You volunteered.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.120
Now it's your time to get out.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.120
What's your name?

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.120
I should volunteer.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.120
My name is Linda.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.120
Linda, no bummers.

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.120
Linda, no bummers.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.120
No bummers.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.120
Here we go.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.120
No bummers.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.120
Should I have another baby?

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.120
What?

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.120
For dinner?

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.120
Hey.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.120
Hey.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.120
Come on.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.120
Come on.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.120
How many are you... How many?

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.120
You popped into my head.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.120
How many you up to?

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.120
I have two kids and they're nine and 14.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.120
Boy or girl?

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120
What?

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120
Come on.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.120
You're just gonna fucking chill?

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.120
Hey, everybody.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.120
You don't know Linda's deal.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.120
Leave some for the rest of us.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.120
Linda, boy or girl?

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.120
14-year-old boy.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.120
Trying to start a highlight team or something?

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.120
Come on.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.120
And my new husband doesn't have any.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.120
Have any.

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.120
See?

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.120
Come out.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.120
Two people.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.120
No boo.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.120
That was you a second ago and now you have this new information.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.120
You're like, this is a noodle scratcher.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.120
Is your hubby a gung-ho about it?

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.120
No.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.120
No.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.120
No.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.120
No.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.120
No.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.120
No.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.120
No.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.120
No.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.120
No.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.120
No.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.120
No.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.120
No.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.120
No.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.120
No.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.120
No.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.120
Does he have a gung-ho about it?

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.120
Does he want to have a kid?

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:27.800
He's very pleased to make me happy, but his love is…

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:28.800
Sure.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.800
Then you gotta do it.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.800
Are you into it?

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800
No, come on.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.800
Stop it.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800
Are you into the idea?

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.800
I mean, that's ultimately like the only…

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.800
It's scary, the only…

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.800
I would love to have the support of a wonderful man…

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.800
He's a bit nice, though.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.800
You got the 14-year-old with the baby-sit.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.800
That's true.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.800
I mean…

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.800
That's built-in.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.800
That's nice.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.800
Yeah, that's not a bad point.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.800
Like, you don't get that.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:51.320
Like you don't get that like Justin six me three Griffin like three months old. There wasn't like Justin you got this

01:03:54.200 --> 01:04:00.100
Don't you're shoving a cold kid cuisine down his throat. Oh, he died a great work six-year-old

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:04.520
I guess you didn't first time my baby said I was 12 years old and I microwaved a pot

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:11.040
Because I was trying to make rice pudding from a recipe for book for kids

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:17.960
in my defense a recipe book for kids should have clarified the proper cookware

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.560
It's all say they'll know right? Yeah

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.040
No, it's

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.560
It already went to print

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.200
It's 1992. They'll know right?

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:34.960
I mean you do you want a pros and cons list like pros like

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.560
that this

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:42.520
Could be like this super successful kid this one. You might not have had the super successful kid

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:46.560
You might not have had the the Bill Gates yet. I don't know anything about your other two children

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.700
They might be very bright, but they are they are they are they here?

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:59.360
Okay, well it feels a little greedy

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.160
What if you're what if the reason once your ender?

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:10.000
Oh my god, what if the reason they've been so great so far is because you have exactly enough energy to raise two great kids

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:16.560
What if at this point you're dividing your labors and you're gonna get three our parents had two at one point and they were awesome

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.060
They were going

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:20.060
Everything was going so well

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:26.880
Hey, if it weren't for me the show we called my brother and me and we'd have some Nickelodeon would be very litigious in that regard

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:34.920
Yeah, you have to have me terrific Linda there is literally

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:41.480
Not a single piece of information. I need to answer this question that I would feel comfortable asking you

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:48.000
Literally cannot get any of the facts. I need to solve this problem for you and let and just to clarify

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.880
Once we answer this it is binary. Yeah

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:56.400
We are literally deciding the existence of a human being right now

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:02.440
Will you name that child after us? Oh shit by which I mean the brothers, okay?

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.240
the baby the baby the movie dot org dot org

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.920
hashtag

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:12.040
You put the hashtag at the end of the web address, right? That's how that wait

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.360
Do you want to do it?

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:23.200
Look at all three of us in the eyes six eyes six eyes all the stuff Linda. Do you want to do it?

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:28.320
No, fuck. Come on. I'm not gonna push it out of my body Linda

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:34.080
Yeah, I wish I could for you because I'd love to feel what it's like in the world. Anybody have a coin

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.800
Linda our level involvement with our child will put most deadbeat dads make them look like heroes

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:45.880
Like we are not going to be involved in the racing of this child. That's why I'm not tying myself to an answer on this show

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.400
Okay, well you ask I'm thinking of a number between one and two

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.600
Guess it

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:58.400
It was two that means you have to have the baby. Congratulations Linda. She's having a baby. I

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:09.680
I feel pretty weird about that one. I just created a human life. I am unto a god

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:17.180
Alright, what else we got guys? How long we've been going we've been going for three and a half hours feels that way

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:19.180
So do you wanna Yahoo? Yeah. Yeah

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:23.200
Come on

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.200
Show

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:33.840
Just created a human life what the fuck else do you want more fart jokes? We just created a person

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:39.880
You guys need to get your priorities straight this Yahoo was sent in by Charlene. Thank you char or Charlene

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:47.460
It was asked by Yahoo answers user Kayla who asks does this seem like a good PowerPoint to show my parents?

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.680
Convincing them to help me get a horse

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.680
I

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:59.840
Slide one horses are awesome. Click click. Hey, your joke is exactly what's in the bit

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.520
Title what I want most in life. Sure. Yeah

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:11.960
No, what everyone wants most in life really for being honest next slide content. Wait timeout. We talk about horses a lot

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.720
Sorry

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:20.700
Just here when everyone else does I don't think we talk about them more than like

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:25.500
Anyone should normal people like people normally talk about horses. They're pretty great

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:33.760
Pretty solid next slide contents asking them to stay silent during the presentation

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:42.560
Mom's dad's mom shit down fucking cell phone off. It's business. I worked on this for a half a fucking hour

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:47.360
You close Pinterest for us for like a second pause frozen

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.200
Amanda

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.960
close pictures

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:55.880
Next some photos of horses along with words all caps a horse

01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:00.240
So just fucking laying down the foundation. That's good

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:07.200
The ground the equestrian groundwork in case you were not aware click click exhibit a exhibit a a horse

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:13.080
Or legs hoods. What if that's all it took? Oh, that's a horse. Okay. Oh shit. That's basically the cool

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:19.300
Yeah, you can have they have ever seen five thousand dollars and then five thousand dollars a year. Yeah totes. Totally. Yeah

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:26.000
Next telling them how I've changed and I'm responsible enough to take care of all I killed the last listen

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
I know I fucked up last year

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:31.440
Bad, I know I fucked up with dad's little dumpling last year

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:37.600
And then I know that I fucked up the year before that with dazzle dumpling jr. Wait

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:43.480
jr. Was predicated upon the fact that this horse was in fact going to die and also

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:48.560
Proceeded it's that it was a time-traveling feature horse

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:58.200
No one's a special horse listen, we had to act fast to buy that special special time-traveling horse

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.480
Forget already daddy's little Dublin

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.160
So much. It's a good name. I've changed though

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:11.720
And I can do it next supplies and costs. I've done my research

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:17.480
Check out this Excel spreadsheet. Does this get your blood pumping the next one's my favorite?

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.480
next

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.640
money saving tips and ideas

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.280
Mom dad you've been

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.680
listening

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:30.000
Diane do you need all those clothes? I need a horse real bad for the third time

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:35.440
We could cut our food budget click click in half that is

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:43.120
Next we're spending so much on oats our oats budget could know that's my mistake. That is not a typographical error

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:50.760
It's budget will drastically increase. I believe it may have been the bottleneck in the last two horse experiments

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.960
Come to think of it in retrospect

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.080
Upon further reflection our oats supply was was at issue

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.280
Next this little Dublin jr

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:10.960
Next explaining the benefits to owning a horse many pros and cons chart. I put together. I bet the cons list is pretty fair

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.320
there

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.320
cons too great

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.440
Too many main too smooth

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:25.240
Will eventually die in six months. Sorry dad. Sorry about this. Our yard is full

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.280
next

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.480
Showing one horse I really want and that would be perfect for me

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:37.080
then two others that would work great for me and I want so and

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:42.840
And they'll always know they were second and always horses have a sixth sense for that stuff

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.520
Next a last side note. Well, I guess they'd be their fifth sense because horses don't have thinking. Yeah

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.080
Or taste a some

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:59.840
Salt what do you want told great? No good choice just salt then

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:07.120
Fantastic. We're excellent selection Tom click. Yeah, perfect. You're just gonna lick a big block of salt. Fantastic

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:12.820
Do you want that over a potato? No, just the salts great thing. Thanks. I'm good here. Hmm. Just gonna give me running energy

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:14.640
terrific

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.640
Great work horse

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:21.320
Stupid next get a job get a job horse salt theme

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:25.920
What's your sodium like next a last side note and telling them I don't want to hear

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:31.320
Anything about this topic until next week so that they can talk about it with each other and then look at the PowerPoint and think

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.960
And whatnot, you know, yeah, what the fuck?

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:43.100
Do not rush to judgment mom and dad I'm gonna yeah, I think that's a fucking huge power

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:48.040
That's a shoe last slide. Click click stay silent after shut your fucking mouth

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:53.100
Keep your phone silent and also keep your fucking mouth shut not until next Tuesday

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:57.000
Yeah, we'll be horse to me click click for a week. Good night

01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:02.520
You say that and we laugh at that that's gonna be just enough time for that sweet idea to firm it

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:06.920
Well, cuz what night one is like, can you believe she can you believe she did that shit for the third fucking time?

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:12.080
Like we would even do that. I think you were right. We should have another kid. This one's a bus. This one sucks

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:16.600
Then maybe three days later, it's like, you know what I'm thinking about it

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:20.200
We had some good times at that horse and then the next day it's like no

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:23.160
It died and then the other one died like super fast

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:28.600
What are we thinking right and then by the seventh day, that's when God rested. What were you talking about?

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.760
This seems foolproof to me

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:39.040
It's pretty solid if you have a foolproof plan for getting a horse and you've been sitting on for this long

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.040
I'm very upset with both of you

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:45.120
You gotta let me in on that stuff. Have another answer Travis question

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:50.960
Mm-hmm. How's the show go? Should we do one more from the audience? Yes. Yeah

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:54.120
Somebody far back cuz I want

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:59.460
Nobody back there has their hand up. That's fine. Anybody else? No, I see you. Yes

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.160
Yes, come on down far this back person we could see

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:12.520
Oh, no, we'll give J. Oh JP, I'm sorry

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.320
Hello, thanks

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:26.320
My name is Jeannie and my question is so I have a cat who pees terrific we all do

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:35.160
Hold the fucking phone one second

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:43.840
Yeah, it's great it's like a big long chair Jeannie was it was it Jeannie I

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:49.520
I would like to have a couch someday not a dream. You should announce in public. Yeah, I

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:54.120
Would like to have a kind of the perfect sitting platform

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.200
I'd like to solve this whole couch thing one day

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:03.760
Have you thought about finding a cheap couch that you can buy a wholesale that you can treat like a burner?

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:10.640
And you can have a burner couch that will last you for a month until the smell starts to overtake your your boot

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.880
Yeah buying a box your cat could be in yeah

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:18.920
Let's workshop this I want to hear the endgame of Griffin's plan where you have a couch

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.960
Designated for your cat to be in basically well

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:25.900
No, you would also do a little bit of sitting in it from time to time

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.680
Maybe a bit of lounging

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.440
Who gets stuck sitting in the bait cow?

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:36.360
What you know you have to take put a lot of tape down the middle say cat that have is your that's your

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.800
Be cool

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.840
When you watch orange is the new black. What do you even fucking do?

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:47.560
Do you stand up and look at the TV like you're saluting it?

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:53.080
That's what you're shaking your head. Yes. I stand up and look at the TV. What's your gym?

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.080
I should just lays down on the hardwood floor

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:58.520
Yeah, yoga ball. What's your sitting game like?

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:05.720
It's so wait. Oh my god. Okay, so your cat won't pee in a chair. It needs a lot of room to express itself

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:10.160
Is it like an inflatable plastic chair? I wish I had one. I

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.980
Considered it. Yeah, I said again like a plastic inflatable chair

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:18.480
Couch, this is such a nice furniture set. Yes from Spencer's gifts

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.160
It came with the plasma ball. It looks super great

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.360
It came with all the novelty greeting cards with bikini babes on

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.400
Jeannie how old is your cat?

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.400
Oh

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.480
Ornery pee cats. Yeah

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.960
Jeannie I got bad news who is real young. Yeah, that's a lot

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.360
13 I would have said stick it out take it out and then Travis. That's a bummer

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:52.440
So, I mean, I'm just saying you got like another 13 years of peace. Oh couch. Yeah

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:58.860
Maybe it's time for more permanent solution. Let the cat explore the world. Yeah, maybe that's an outdoor cat from now on

01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:03.560
Cats cats can't talk and the only way they can ask for freedom is by peeing on your couch

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.920
Maybe that cat saying I think I can do this on my own. I

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:12.440
Caught a homer bound on Cinemax last week and that seems like something I could super get into

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:19.720
Please open the door or I'm going to keep peeing. What's your favorite thing? Cuz I guess it was couch

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.720
I

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:25.600
Read your journal about wanting a couch someday and I want out

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:30.080
You made me feel guilty cuz I have two couches

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:36.640
I have three couches in my house and you made me feel like I'm living some sort of life of extreme luxury that I don't

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:43.320
Does it not use the litter box what's going on with your cat's whole deal

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:52.560
Is she mad at you? Maybe she's mad that you don't have a couch. Get a dog cuz those never pee anyway. Yeah

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.040
That's isn't that why you haven't neutered

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:02.240
Yeah, yeah, that's exactly it. Do you want this water spot? Nah, I'm cool

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:08.080
I got neutered so I don't even need fluids in my whole body. No, so I miss folks super neutered. Yeah

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:15.040
I just get in there take it all just get in there with an ice cream scoop and really just like

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:24.320
Why is your cat crying oh she's not super super super neutered

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:33.960
It's basically eyes longs firm and that's about it. That's about all that's going on in there. She's very agile though

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.200
So that's I guess the best

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.720
I don't know what else to tell you buy a couch and just yeah

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:48.320
It's no I mean it is definitely your probably a couch in every room and you will have at least a while where she hasn't found

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:52.280
One yeah, she'll probably get into the jam of peeing on one and maybe you can put that in the bubble

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.640
Do you have any bubbles?

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.880
Can you put like I asked you a question whether or not you have bubbles

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:05.240
What about a tarp? Okay, you need you don't have a lot of things you yeah

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:09.440
Jeannie you have a lot of super achievable life goals, and I'm into that I

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.840
I think that's gonna bring you a lot of happiness

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:19.600
How are you feeling today Jenny like super fulfilled? I met like two of the biggies today. It's going good with one trip to Rite-Aid

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:24.320

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.800
Oh, yeah, I got a Rite-Aid couch is great

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
