us mackerels are lovers not fighters we don't we weren't really caught into violence don't

03:06.880 --> 03:13.600
cotton to it um yeah i've only been in one fight in my life and it was when a someone cut in the

03:13.600 --> 03:19.760
four square line and i i spoke up and i got slapped in my face it was such a powerful slap that i fell

03:19.760 --> 03:28.160
down to the ground you you're only 19 so let me let me uh give you some guidance from somebody

03:28.160 --> 03:35.200
who's 29 who's got a decade on you if you try to fight everybody who's an idiot you are going to

03:35.200 --> 03:42.080
be exhausted because most people are stupid and deserve to have their faces punched in you just

03:42.080 --> 03:47.440
can't you don't have enough punches in you for all the people that need to be literally fucking

03:47.440 --> 03:52.000
punched in the nose like hard until it breaks and the bone goes up in their brain and kills

03:52.000 --> 03:57.280
mentally can i tell you why i've never gotten in a fight for real um and you should really

03:57.280 --> 04:01.680
you should take note of this ramsey because you're only 19 um i'm always afraid like the

04:01.680 --> 04:07.040
first fight i get into like it's gonna get into 50 cuffs and then someone's gonna like punch me

04:07.040 --> 04:14.080
in my eye or like in my good eye and just pop it right out and then i won't have an eye anymore or

04:14.080 --> 04:21.120
like they'll punch me in my my sweet straight teeth and and jack up my whole grill and and

04:21.120 --> 04:24.960
that'll be the end and that'll be a thing i have to deal with for the rest of my life like they'll

04:24.960 --> 04:29.840
punch me and then i'll have an owen wilson nose for the rest of my life because of this one

04:29.840 --> 04:36.240
altercation do you know why you know why i never gotten a fight i was taking a stage combat class

04:36.240 --> 04:41.280
and uh the professor grabbed my wrist and held my fist up in the air and announced very loudly

04:41.280 --> 04:47.600
does everyone see this travis mcroy has fists of iron if he were to ever accidentally hit someone

04:47.600 --> 04:53.680
he would kill them so i've lived in fear that the first time i punch someone you'll lock their eye

04:53.680 --> 04:58.640
out i will just straight up kill them well travis you've been in more fights than than all of us

04:58.640 --> 05:02.640
because i remember one time in middle school there was an altercation where you beat the shit out of

05:02.640 --> 05:08.880
somebody with a trombone case that is correct knocking right on his ass uh good times good

05:08.880 --> 05:13.680

05:50.800 --> 05:56.000
a bracelet for snacking on the go is you stack them on your fingers like rings and then you eat

05:56.000 --> 06:00.880
them off um while pretending to be rushing that's what happened whatever happened in that middle

06:00.880 --> 06:05.440
brother that used to be on that show didn't you hear he ate chicken rings almost exclusively

06:05.440 --> 06:10.960

06:18.720 --> 06:27.120

kind of childlike impulse where they just sit in the middle of a kitchen and say i want to eat all

07:17.600 --> 07:25.360

07:25.360 --> 07:30.560
my son trained to defecate in a bag instead of a toilet or diaper any suggestions or tips

07:33.680 --> 07:36.800
my wife and i are very environment conscious and have been thinking

07:40.240 --> 07:44.720
he isn't potty trained yet and we don't really want him formally trained to use a toilet which

07:44.720 --> 07:50.720
we believe wastes water and drains resources my wife and i started my wife and i started going

07:50.720 --> 07:57.360
in bags about two years ago no you did it and we use the excrement blended with other materials

07:57.360 --> 08:04.240
to fertilize our garden and also and also sell it to friends for extra spending money

08:06.240 --> 08:11.840
but we have no but we have had problems getting him to squat and be patient enough to go

08:11.840 --> 08:18.560

day asking the teacher where you can go shit where's the shit bag room he totally pre-empted

that uh because in the additional details he says he won't need a bag to be packed into his backpack

08:50.000 --> 08:54.720

thinks it's whatever feels right for you it's it's mainly about showing that you're considerate so

12:41.440 --> 12:48.800
you know if you know she's had a hard day you uh make dinner if she forgot to get uh her retainer

12:48.800 --> 12:53.920

12:53.920 --> 12:59.680
could do maybe polishing her bow staff you guys are both you guys are making jokes but i think

12:59.680 --> 13:04.240

13:04.240 --> 13:13.840

13:13.840 --> 13:22.560
ask what what don't worry lady in the caverns but i'm freaking the bedroll

13:24.720 --> 13:31.600
i'm saying i'm saying she's probably so shy but see in her secret heart of hearts

13:32.320 --> 13:40.960

my wife being a traditionalist refers to it as his penis i being a little more hip call it as a

14:09.840 --> 14:17.440
junk now when he refers to it as his junk my wife cringes it gives me dirty looks what do you guys

14:17.440 --> 14:20.800

15:47.120 --> 15:56.960
dad name for it oh god wiener machine it's wiener machine what about something nice and non-specific

15:56.960 --> 16:06.320
like coach coach is good because he like he tells you what to do and plus he's got a whistle

16:06.320 --> 16:22.240
he's got a way do you guys not have that this is from chris uh via gmail says i can't seem to get

16:22.240 --> 16:27.920
my wife's attention we both work that's what i hear when someone uses an exclamation point uh we

16:27.920 --> 16:32.560
both work fast-paced jobs long hours and long commutes we're either going full speed or pass out

16:32.560 --> 16:37.280
from exhaustion we tend to buzz right by each other on most days my question is how can i get

16:37.280 --> 16:41.680
her to slow down and start hanging out more i'd like to do something special so i figured i'd

16:41.680 --> 16:46.080
solicit some expert advice from you guys as a side note molly my wife is a loyal listener so

16:46.080 --> 16:51.200
she should be listening right now assuming you get to my question maybe a plea directly to her

16:51.200 --> 16:56.320
would do the trick uh the mbmb am wedding proposal was a home run can you spray a little magic for

16:56.320 --> 17:01.920
us chris maybe you could clear like 30 minutes in your own schedule to think about the fact that

17:01.920 --> 17:09.920
your wife makes time for us but not you enjoy that enough that could be something you could do

17:09.920 --> 17:15.760
in your spare time maybe she maybe she like listens to us on the commute um but but this

17:15.760 --> 17:19.600
idea is worth looking into if she if she does listen to us on a commute maybe you should do

17:19.600 --> 17:24.160
your own podcast uh but the podcast isn't you giving advice to people who desperately need it

17:24.160 --> 17:29.920
as much as it is um you just talking about your wife talking about how much you love your wife

17:29.920 --> 17:35.360
love your wife all the things that you do uh in the day that your wife doesn't know about but

17:35.360 --> 17:43.040
you know should know about um and we can call it molly talk molly talk if you need some tips

17:43.040 --> 17:52.400

men's locker room after a hard workout no one no one checks it there's there there's okay before

18:13.360 --> 18:20.080

jacuzzi naked with your dad and other friends the the components of that stew that you're you're

you're broiling there is dicks and water okay can we agree that is a dick a hot dick and water stew

18:55.600 --> 19:02.960
that you are brewing up um if you wear uh swimming trunks then the components to that stew

19:02.960 --> 19:12.240
are swimming trunks water and dicks still so if no one's checking anyone out you're just adding

19:12.240 --> 19:19.440
some some cloth and some mesh to to the dick jambalaya that you're you're creating there okay

19:19.440 --> 19:25.120
but let me counterpoint that by saying that same logic can be applied to any situation in which

19:25.120 --> 19:30.160
clothes are worn you know like if we're naked under our clothes anyways why don't we all just

19:30.160 --> 19:35.280
go to school naked yeah that's not a good that's not a good excuse but it's different because

19:36.080 --> 19:41.440
we wear clothes in normal life so that nobody can can see our dicks when you're in a jacuzzi

19:41.440 --> 19:47.760
it's not about the sight it's about the it's about it's about no it's about it's about the water

19:48.480 --> 19:54.880
convection right it's all about convection it's science here explain to me this jeff now i'm i'm

19:54.880 --> 19:59.840
not you jeff i've not lived a walked a mile in your shoes but maybe you can explain this to me

19:59.840 --> 20:08.160
if i'm walking through my gymnasium and i'm walking to the sauna and along the path to said sauna

20:08.160 --> 20:15.120
i see my dad and a bunch of old men naked in a tub and my dad's like hey jeff do you want to

20:15.120 --> 20:21.360
get in this tub with all of us we're naked and our balls are out and everything do you want to

20:21.360 --> 20:30.080
do you want to get into this stuff jeff our balls and everything don't even kid yourself everything's

20:30.080 --> 20:38.800
out jeff i have changed my answer any scenario that um you can enter into that may possibly

20:38.800 --> 20:46.800
even if it's like a 0.001 chance of touching dicks with your dad is a scenario that's worth

20:46.800 --> 20:52.560
avoiding like what if there's an earthquake jeff oh no get out no i'm going that way coming this

20:52.560 --> 20:56.640
way oh no i gotta get now i gotta go to the bullet store and kill myself

20:56.640 --> 21:02.160
what does that happen jeff you can't take what okay why did we even entertain this

21:02.160 --> 21:07.360
possibility jeff you can't take naked baths with your dad phone call and someone's like what are

21:07.360 --> 21:12.000
you doing jeff you're like i'm just taking a naked bath my daddy and some of his old friends

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
and their balls are out and stuff that's great i'm gonna go out on a limb and say if you were

21:16.000 --> 21:21.600
in eight separate jacuzzis but only naked and looking at each other it's not any better yeah

21:21.600 --> 21:26.720
it's not any better it may be worse what's the maximum distance that you have to keep

21:27.440 --> 21:33.040
your naked genitalia away from from your dad three states or one layer of cloth

21:35.280 --> 21:41.360
unless that cloth is trunks now one addendum i think this scenario is okay if you're greek if

21:41.360 --> 21:45.120
you're like super greek and not like yeah you have a little bit of greek yeah and you but i'm

21:45.120 --> 21:49.360
talking like heavy greek no heavy greek then it's then it's complete if you're going heavy greek

21:49.360 --> 21:54.320
you're okay to take a naked bath yeah that's just science chicken chance how should i wear a flannel

21:54.320 --> 22:02.560
shirt without looking bad now listen there's there's a matrix of options here we need to come

22:02.560 --> 22:11.040
up with an algorithm uh using these these metrics that dk has provided okay options white v-neck

22:11.040 --> 22:17.600
black wife beater white wife beater black crew neck gray crew neck no undershirt how many buttons

22:17.600 --> 22:25.920
undone zero one two three etc bonus what type of jeans add or deduct things i am a guy i am

22:25.920 --> 22:35.120
skinny i have short hair first off i want to say how much i appreciate him going through the

22:35.120 --> 22:42.320
different numbers of buttons because sometimes i get hitched between two and four and i have to

22:42.320 --> 22:50.800
remember ah shit three that's the one it is a red black plaid flannel shirt he has one shirt

22:50.800 --> 22:55.520
that he is dying to wear but he's just eyeballing it from across the room trying to figure it out

22:55.520 --> 23:02.240
to wear it the right way you know i have one flannel shirt that grants me wishes and i have

23:02.240 --> 23:12.480
to wear it dk hold on to your asshole white v-neck okay all buttons undone wrapped around your waist

23:12.480 --> 23:20.800
torn faded light blue jeans i love it it's that's the joey lawrence is what i call that look yeah

but not a utility kill because i'll leap through the internet i'll fucking strangle you

23:33.680 --> 23:38.400
why do you feel the need to to wear this shirt it sounds like he's causing you a lot of

23:38.400 --> 23:44.400
consternation maybe just throw it do like a better question is how many failed attempts

23:44.400 --> 23:49.600
has he had it wearing a shirt he just comes home dejected and strips it all goes today wasn't my

23:49.600 --> 23:55.200
day i can't do it internet clothes but no cigar do you think he's sitting in this room with like

23:55.200 --> 24:03.920
three blackboards surrounding him he's just like madly doing you have to eat shut up figuring out

24:03.920 --> 24:10.800
the shirt continuum no undershirt one button undone blue jeans honey we're supposed to be

24:10.800 --> 24:18.880

24:53.760 --> 25:00.000
he finally he finally finally solves it in celebration he tips over his blackboard tears

25:00.000 --> 25:09.520

seen her once and have not been through her checkout line what can i purchase at her register

29:59.600 --> 30:04.720
to make a great first impression is there a sequence of items that will make her mine

30:07.280 --> 30:14.000
people who want great questions this is a great question jar of honey box of condoms children's

30:14.000 --> 30:24.720
movie fish oil i would say walk up and slap down like a bag of kitty litter and stare her directly

30:24.720 --> 30:32.560
in the eyes and say i don't own a cat um here's a get extra small condoms and then throw them on

30:32.560 --> 30:38.640

little rubber things you put on your thumb to go through papers that would be ideal

31:01.040 --> 31:08.080

31:11.520 --> 31:15.200
i don't think any of these things are gonna work i don't think so either man

31:15.200 --> 31:20.880
this is really bad advice it seemed good it seemed like it was going so well

31:23.760 --> 31:29.760
good one us in the past gosh we were really on point back then those are the days what the

31:29.760 --> 31:35.520
fuck happened there used to be a lot of joy and conviviality in our in our lives and our demeanors

31:36.160 --> 31:41.840
and it's just it seems like it's all it's all gone is it is it you think it's marriage i don't

31:41.840 --> 31:46.000

in my arm heard there's some plague out west so i just wanted to you know kind of get out ahead

37:08.560 --> 37:14.160
of it justin if you'd ever listen to our medical history podcast saw bones where we talk about

37:14.160 --> 37:18.880
everything from trepanation to bloodletting you would know that that is a ridiculous idea and it

37:18.880 --> 37:27.120
will never work so i haven't caught it saw bones yes it's every friday on the maximum fun network

37:27.120 --> 37:32.400
and we record it together doctor something yes

37:37.760 --> 37:44.800
so i would like some information some steps to take to become a wizard well robert i'm glad you

37:44.800 --> 37:51.920
asked i have some pamphlets here that i think you might be interested in not about wizard but about

37:51.920 --> 37:57.840
i run like an anti harry potter school that teaches kids that their magic is shameful have

37:57.840 --> 38:02.880
you thought about the magic of our lord and savior jesus christ he means that's the thing

38:02.880 --> 38:08.800
not about that magic i think when a lot of people hear the word wizard they think magic i think

38:08.800 --> 38:14.640
there are star wars episode one there are a lot of elements of the of the wizard lifestyle that i

38:14.640 --> 38:22.720
think you can adopt without you know knowing how to okay good step one like uh beard beard up day

38:22.720 --> 38:30.400
one beard get yeah um naked day two naked day two because you're a wizard gotta keep save something

38:30.400 --> 38:38.240
uh blue robe yeah a long robe but i need a familiar that's how are your sleeves hey you're by the way

38:39.120 --> 38:44.160
everybody in class your little brother doesn't count as your familiar way to put the effort into

38:44.160 --> 38:51.440
it not not at all and don't spray paint your cat it seems like a good idea at first just spend the

38:51.440 --> 38:56.880
extra money and get the black cat with all the extras it's worth it for the features like that

38:56.880 --> 39:04.480
tail you can crank to cast spells uh you need to capture some villagers and lock them in your

39:04.480 --> 39:10.560
basement um oh you're going like evil wiz no no i mean that's that's a natural how do you have

39:10.560 --> 39:17.200
you not read harry potter i think you might have been reading like a maybe like an offshoot series

39:17.200 --> 39:23.760
so did you see did you check these out on harry potter dot info slash fan stories i actually i

39:23.760 --> 39:30.480
read helter skelter that's my bad that's on me that's all is is the theory we're working on here

39:30.480 --> 39:34.960
that if you have all the trappings of wizardry and you do all the things that magic powers just come

39:34.960 --> 39:39.200
like you wake up one morning and your beard is just long enough and so you can look at things

39:39.200 --> 39:46.240
yeah have you ever seen um uh the santa clause uh class spelled c l a u s e as in like a legal

39:46.240 --> 39:56.480
clause yeah uh-huh whoa that this is already funny it's kind of slow down i didn't make it past the

39:56.480 --> 40:03.680
title god tim ellen you you know he knows exactly where my funny mode is like surgical stride style

40:03.680 --> 40:12.960
why are cats testicles furry and humans not i would like furry testicles thank you furry cat

40:12.960 --> 40:22.080
furry cat testicles look so cool don't you think so i've had i've actually had that thought as well

40:22.720 --> 40:28.480
i've just just look at not on an actual cat but on a like a furry like a furry like a human being

40:28.480 --> 40:34.560
dressed up like a cat yeah i'm just saying that that's kind of a cool look i was actually thinking

40:34.560 --> 40:43.760
of naming my new garage band that furry cat testes what is the uh what's the story with um with cat

40:43.760 --> 40:49.200
balls are people looking at these things more than i knew that they were is that it's troubling

40:49.200 --> 40:55.520
when in the same week i get sent two questions that have to do with cat genitalia um i didn't

40:55.520 --> 41:02.640
know maybe it's some sort of some sort of looks like bird watching maybe looking at cat balls is

41:02.640 --> 41:12.800
the new watching paint dry watching the cat's balls uh i i don't think that you should i think

41:12.800 --> 41:17.520
it's one of the mortal sins to cover the balls of another animal isn't that in the in the bible or

41:17.520 --> 41:22.320
something well no because cats are an exception because you're supposed to worship them and they're

41:22.320 --> 41:34.720
sweet tits and they're huge awesome balls my suggestion um a clipboard i know it seemed

41:34.720 --> 41:40.320
but it'll let you get away with literally anything you can put sudoku on there you can put some

41:40.320 --> 41:45.200
crossword on there or just carry it around so no one how did you how did you just pronounce

41:45.200 --> 41:54.080
the word sudoku i think i said sudoku sudoku no griffin you're confused sudoku is that new joint

41:54.080 --> 42:01.520
if you guys played sadaka are you playing neil sadaka i was actually thinking of the gas station

42:01.520 --> 42:09.760
sunoko did you get that new john sakata record wow and the game included inside the zd notes

42:09.760 --> 42:15.360
really fun i've been playing all day sudoku is that is that new sudoku where it makes a picture

42:15.360 --> 42:22.480
at the end and then the cards bounce around the screen an erotic picture that's a sexy picture

42:23.840 --> 42:25.680
it kind of looks like a boob made of blocks

42:30.000 --> 42:34.400
oh yeah what's up with that what's the story there there's a we got an email from this dj

42:34.400 --> 42:43.200

of rave is this is this a reggae rave lose yourself in the sound of a steel drum

44:52.080 --> 45:00.880
where's the minute bowl when you get the story right oh shit uh so so hopefully that's enough

45:03.120 --> 45:08.160
most of our most of our episodes are about hip-hop and r&b i draw most of the the things

45:08.160 --> 45:14.320
we say from the recordings of jay-z and missile war in hell is it sad that for um

45:15.120 --> 45:21.280
for um the better part of my entire life i thought r&b stood for rap and beats

45:23.920 --> 45:32.160
what i thought it stood for rap and beats this is my brother my brother and me and it's an

45:32.160 --> 45:40.000
advice show for the modern era we also will teach you that r&b does not stand for rap and beats

45:41.440 --> 45:45.600
what does it say how long how well do you enjoy that rap and beats music

45:46.560 --> 45:52.560
she's the greatest rap and beats singer of all time alia is the new princess of hip-hop

45:52.560 --> 46:02.160
and rap and beats god bless you who sings better justin bieber or cisco the thong song what

46:05.440 --> 46:12.480
that's all part of the question um why wouldn't he hook us up with a bieber a bieber title he goes

46:12.480 --> 46:18.400
on to explain um the thong song was the biggest single since billy jean michael jackson do you

46:18.400 --> 46:25.040
think that justin can top that so he's coming from the cisco side like he's defending cisco here he

46:25.040 --> 46:29.120
has got that full-on cisco heat and cisco is the greatest artist that has lived since michael

46:29.120 --> 46:33.520
jackson i'm pretty sure he had the number one single one of his friends said bieber is the

46:33.520 --> 46:38.720
greatest musical artist of our generation he said excuse me what about cisco and he was laughed down

46:38.720 --> 46:43.520
and he turned to his only friend the internet to prove him right good old yahoo answers is always

46:43.520 --> 46:50.640
there for you that cisco knowledge so where do you guys stand what do you so bieber bieber cisco

46:50.640 --> 46:57.680
bieber has has so much to go through in his life cisco has already gone through so you're saying

46:57.680 --> 47:02.000
cisco's got the experience or do you say that bieber can can still has so much in front of him

47:02.000 --> 47:08.320
that he can be shaped and formed by his experiences to to a sum that is greater than cisco i think

47:08.320 --> 47:16.320
that what needs to happen is a musical apprenticeship of justin bieber to cisco oh my god reform drew hill

47:16.960 --> 47:24.640
with cisco justin bieber ellen degenerus from hansen the little kid from hansen the littlest

47:24.640 --> 47:30.560
one the baby the one that's like three or four still forever forever baby super group forever

47:30.560 --> 47:38.720
baby is another good name for a band call them the traveling willberries too and they'll just just go

47:38.720 --> 47:44.240
they would never collaborate on a single musical project they would only do versions of their own

47:44.880 --> 47:50.480
composite songs like they would sing thong songs they would sing uh baby which is listening to

47:50.480 --> 47:56.000
other cities would be tantamount to listening to it now that's what i call music in 1994

47:56.000 --> 48:02.960
like that's that's the experience shit how many of those did you guys own um be honest zero zero

48:02.960 --> 48:10.080
i owned three what yeah i own three of them the third one was an ironic present um from justin

48:10.080 --> 48:14.320
mensker but how many times did you listen to that oh a lot of times a lot of times there's

48:14.320 --> 48:20.480
a really good fastball cut on that one a really deep cut they get out to the bonyard fastball

48:20.480 --> 48:28.400
track was it um was it perchance the way chicken chance you want to turn around and say goodbye

lobster no no the answer is clearly no but i mean the abkins diet maybe but that's a temporary

54:41.760 --> 54:48.400
that ketosis only lasts for so long rock lobster that's a deep burn deep burn you will be reddened

54:48.400 --> 54:54.880
after that down muscles and it breaks down all the fatty acids the fatty layers and they just

54:54.880 --> 55:01.120
fall off your body that's the i went a step further okay i had a condom surgically attached

55:01.120 --> 55:10.960
to my penis oh god god i just sometimes i just try to make griffin sad i chucked in my coffee cup

55:13.760 --> 55:16.880
how does that so you can use it once

55:16.880 --> 55:25.840
no that's the problem he just keeps using it if it actually gets punctured it's considered a

55:25.840 --> 55:34.720
biological weapon what is in there what did you do you killed 30 people why are you standing

55:34.720 --> 55:40.080
with your pants around your ankle and a gas mask on what are you doing i'm the new outbreak monkey

55:40.080 --> 55:51.040

prosthetically attached condom that's why it was an outpatient surgery uh did here now here's my

56:10.320 --> 56:17.760
question did blue cross blue shield cover that um part of it yeah it was uh it took a lot of

56:17.760 --> 56:24.000
paperwork yeah i would imagine i had to convince him it wasn't elective he got he got jealous of

56:24.000 --> 56:33.600
nuva rings he wanted a similar a masculine alternative yeah um just everyone just everyone

56:33.600 --> 56:39.280
should carry them they give them to like middle schoolers just everyone provide them i'm confused

56:39.920 --> 56:45.040
doesn't everyone just have a box of six condoms that they had had so long that they don't remember

56:45.040 --> 56:50.640
where they came from yeah does everybody just have that because i keep mine in an altoids tin

56:50.640 --> 56:59.840
that has the words jimmy hats like crudely and sharpies uh ashley p asks is this true my mom said

56:59.840 --> 57:07.520
that after you have sex you won't grow taller anymore example get taller that's that's completely

57:07.520 --> 57:13.360
true that is completely true you're spitting out all your bones right yeah that's what makes your

57:13.360 --> 57:18.160
bones is your bone juice they call it they call it boning down because it literally compresses

57:18.160 --> 57:23.680
your bones when you do it yeah that is correct and once you break the seal you're donezo

57:25.200 --> 57:30.640
you actually start shrinking yeah if you just constantly keep blinking all the time you know

57:30.640 --> 57:36.400
how like old old people are really small they only get like that because they're total sluts

57:38.640 --> 57:43.920
