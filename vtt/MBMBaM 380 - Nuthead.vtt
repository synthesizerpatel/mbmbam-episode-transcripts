00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.600
Hello, everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother being advice show for the modern era.

00:47.600 --> 00:51.840
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.840 --> 00:55.600
Hey, I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:55.600 --> 01:03.840
So, how was your weekend? Yeah, it was pretty good. I watched some new stuff.

01:03.840 --> 01:07.200
There's a new, like, cooking show. Oh, cool. Let me tell you about my weekend.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.720
Okay, I did want to hear about Travis's cooking show he's watching.

01:10.720 --> 01:13.680
No, it's really good. Nadia from Great British Bake Off is on it.

01:13.680 --> 01:17.200
I love the big family cooking show. Yeah, it's the big family cooking show.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.720
Justin, I know you had a big weekend, but let's talk about the big family cooking show.

01:20.720 --> 01:26.320
It's just two big families, and I mean gigantic nine foot tall sort of Goliaths,

01:26.320 --> 01:29.600
and they smash all the eggs. In the second challenge show,

01:29.600 --> 01:33.920
you get to see their giant homes. And they eat a whole turkey bones and all,

01:33.920 --> 01:36.640
and they climb up their beanstalk to their big castle in the sky.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.680
It's so good. Let's just talk about that for the intro.

01:39.680 --> 01:43.280
That's the intro, I think, because nothing else. Justin, I know you had kind of a buckwild time,

01:43.280 --> 01:46.320
but again, these giant families are cooking and fighting.

01:46.320 --> 01:51.680
There's a big fight at the end of each episode. Guys, I want to talk about my thing.

01:51.680 --> 01:54.880
Your thing didn't make headlines. My thing made headlines.

01:54.880 --> 02:01.120
Actually, the big families did go around. They crushed many areas in Wales.

02:02.720 --> 02:09.920
So, my good buddy Lynn and Sydney and I went and saw-

02:09.920 --> 02:11.840
Now it's just your buddy Lynn and not our buddy?

02:11.840 --> 02:14.160
Well, our good buddy Lynn, fine. Thank you.

02:14.160 --> 02:18.800
Yes, you're right. Thank you, Travis. Went to go see Escape to Margaritaville,

02:19.760 --> 02:22.800
and double feature of Hamilton.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.560
Is that the sequel to Escape from LA?

02:25.360 --> 02:31.920
We went and saw Hamilton and Escape to Margaritaville with my new best buddy,

02:32.640 --> 02:39.600
Mr. James Buffett, and it was basically the best thing that's ever happened to me.

02:39.600 --> 02:45.280
Jimmy Buffett is basically the nicest person that I know, certainly the nicest person

02:45.840 --> 02:51.200
that is worth a half billion dollars, easily. He wins that pretty much hands down.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.640
I got to ask, because I know you put some thought into this.

02:56.640 --> 03:03.920
You knew you were meeting James, the parrot king, and you knew you were meeting him.

03:03.920 --> 03:07.680
It's going to be a momentous moment in your life. What do you wear for that?

03:07.680 --> 03:10.720
How do you dress yourself for that occasion, I'm wondering?

03:10.720 --> 03:16.080
Okay, so I did initially have a Hawaiian shirt with a sport coat over it,

03:16.080 --> 03:21.280
and then Sydney was like, I don't think so, and I was like, you are correct.

03:21.280 --> 03:24.000
That's right, because we are also seeing Hamilton the same day,

03:24.000 --> 03:25.680
and that would be quite the look.

03:25.680 --> 03:32.000
I mean, you could take a classier selection from the Thomas Bahama collection.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.600
I ended up going with a button down with tasteful palm trees,

03:37.600 --> 03:41.920
small tasteful palm trees on the button down, just a wink and a nod.

03:41.920 --> 03:46.240
One thing that was probably my favorite, there were many,

03:46.240 --> 03:50.080
it was basically the wildest day of my life, but my favorite thing that happened

03:50.080 --> 03:53.600
is that we were having brunch while we were waiting for Jimmy to arrive,

03:54.160 --> 03:58.320
and Lynn and I ordered margaritas to kind of get in the spirit of things,

03:58.320 --> 04:02.160
because we were going to go see Escape to Margaritaville, and it was kind of a theme day.

04:02.160 --> 04:06.960
And the margaritas were still on our table when Mr. Buffett arrived and ordered a latte,

04:06.960 --> 04:10.000
and he did notice, like, oh, you guys are already having margaritas.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.240
It's like, ah, god damn it, okay.

04:12.240 --> 04:16.720
We did order it to have a fun time, and we did not think about the reality.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.440
That was just supposed to be a joke for you and Lynn.

04:20.320 --> 04:25.280
Not a joke, just living in the day, which the greatest thing about Jimmy Buffett

04:25.280 --> 04:29.920
is he is exactly Jimmy Buffett all the time.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.040
Like, he is just him.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.880
He's 24-7 Jimmy Buffett.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.440
24-7 Jimmy Buffett all the time.

04:36.080 --> 04:41.040
Like, the best, having fun, the best.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.520
Like, so excited that we were having margaritas,

04:43.520 --> 04:46.320
that we were living that Parrothead lifestyle, so into it.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.400
And his show was an absolute fucking delight.

04:50.400 --> 04:54.800
If I can say my favorite joke from the show, co-written by,

04:54.800 --> 04:57.200
I will add, Mr. Mike O'Malley.

04:57.200 --> 04:57.700
Whoa.

04:58.400 --> 04:58.800
Yes.

04:58.800 --> 04:59.120
Really?

04:59.120 --> 05:00.320
Singing the leaderboard, Mo.

05:01.360 --> 05:01.860
Yes.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.320
Mr. Mike O'Malley, co-written with Greg Garcia.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.080
My favorite joke in it.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.080
Oh, it's a good, it's a percolating there.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.280
It's a fucking good one.

05:12.960 --> 05:17.920
It's set at this, like, island bar hotel called Margaritaville.

05:17.920 --> 05:18.160
Yes.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.320
And the lady who runs it says,

05:20.320 --> 05:27.040
and in the morning, we've got a top-notch breakfast Buffett.

05:27.040 --> 05:30.400
And she said, the lady who's just shown up, says,

05:30.400 --> 05:34.960
I think you, I'm pretty sure it's pronounced buffet.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.440
And she says, no, I think you're thinking of the singer.

05:37.440 --> 05:43.760
It's so fucking, I was on the floor.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.040
No, it's good, it's good.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.880
But we need to address, does Jimmy Buffett exist?

05:48.880 --> 05:55.200
Does Jimmy Buffett exist in this, in the, in the fiction of this world?

05:55.760 --> 05:59.280
Does Jimmy Buffett exist in Jimmy Buffett's escape from Margaritaville?

05:59.280 --> 06:01.840
Well, that's a good question, Griffin, because like, in Mama Mia,

06:01.840 --> 06:05.360
are the, do the characters ever reference that they are singing ABBA songs?

06:05.360 --> 06:08.720
Yeah, I don't think, so I really do need a question.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.680
I really need my question answered, because the answer is yes, that is,

06:11.680 --> 06:16.880
that is, that, that is a pretty wild sort of world that they've built there.

06:16.880 --> 06:25.440
Um, we are talking about a show where a gentleman shapes an LSD flashback

06:25.440 --> 06:30.000
through the power of his mind so that undead insurance salesmen

06:30.000 --> 06:34.480
wear Technicolor, uh, suits and do a kick line.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.520
Fuck, this is amazing.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.600
How do I get to this show immediately?

06:37.600 --> 06:39.120
Yeah, how do you go right now?

06:39.120 --> 06:40.560
It's in Chicago for another three weeks,

06:40.560 --> 06:45.040
and it's moving to that big Broadway we call Broadway.

06:45.040 --> 06:45.520
Mm-hmm.

06:45.520 --> 06:49.280
Um, and it is, it was great, and I was seated, uh,

06:49.280 --> 06:53.120
across the aisle from James throughout the show, and he was loving it.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.880
Was it the whole time, like, tapping you, like,

06:54.880 --> 06:56.640
oh, this part's, you're gonna love this part.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.000
Wait, you're gonna love this.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.520
No, he got, I told him, Sidney and I told him when we first showed up

07:01.520 --> 07:03.680
that we were really paranoid about spoilers,

07:03.680 --> 07:06.240
because we didn't want to know the tunes that were in it or anything,

07:06.240 --> 07:09.600
and, and every time he would, like, be about to talk about something in the show,

07:09.600 --> 07:13.760
he would stop himself, like, oh, no, I'm sorry, wait, I'm gonna let you see it.

07:13.760 --> 07:18.560
Uh, was he not torn to shreds from, by the audience there,

07:18.560 --> 07:19.520
just trying to get a piece of James?

07:19.520 --> 07:23.920
Oh, my man, it did get a little bit World War Z in there,

07:23.920 --> 07:28.800
because we saw Hamilton with Lin, and then we saw Escape to Margaritaville with James.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.480
I wish you could have gone to a screening,

07:30.480 --> 07:33.600
I wish you could have gone to a screening of the My Brother, My Brother, Me TV show

07:33.600 --> 07:37.120
with all of them, with you in the audience, like, oh, yeah, this is how it is.

07:37.680 --> 07:38.720
Me too, boys.

07:38.720 --> 07:39.520
Me too, I did it.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.760
We got the big three right here.

07:41.760 --> 07:45.920
Lin was trying to stay covert, so when people did start applauding as he walked in,

07:45.920 --> 07:49.680
I just kind of turned around and waved my hands, like, thank you, thank you so much.

07:49.680 --> 07:55.840
I do, I do make several podcasts, thank you so much for, uh, uh, uh, recognizing that.

07:55.840 --> 08:00.720
I did meet two, uh, uh, my Bim Bam fans at Hamilton, Patrick and Heather,

08:00.720 --> 08:03.840
who, like, saved my poor, my poor ego.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.320
It's like, we've heard of you, like, oh, good, yes, yes.

08:06.320 --> 08:06.880
Hey, thanks.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.960
Uh, Lin, people cheered for Lin at Hamilton,

08:10.960 --> 08:14.720
and he had to eventually, like, stand up and everybody was, like, taking pictures and stuff.

08:14.720 --> 08:20.720
Uh, Mr. Buffett came in and was trying to cloak it, you know, a little bit,

08:20.720 --> 08:23.840
mainly because you don't want to distract from the show that people paid a lot of money for

08:23.840 --> 08:28.160
and want to watch, but he did get spotted, and then people started cheering,

08:28.160 --> 08:31.040
and then people just, like, sort of gang rushed.

08:31.040 --> 08:36.000
So there was, like, 20 people just, like, trying to get a taste,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.320
and he was very nice and accommodating to everybody,

08:38.320 --> 08:44.560
but I was having a full-blown, like, where are the exits panic attack, uh, over there,

08:44.560 --> 08:48.880
but he was, he was super nice to everybody, and, uh, I don't know.

08:48.880 --> 08:54.480
It was, it was wild, and I can't thank Lin enough for such a, um, I mean, it just was,

08:55.440 --> 08:56.560
just was out of hand.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.960
Justin, I need to, I need to ask you a question.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.000
I know this is weird.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.720
I realize this is weird, but, like, this is my one chance to ask this question.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.440
How did Jimmy Buffett smell?

09:07.440 --> 09:09.200
I have to know this also!

09:10.720 --> 09:12.240
I have to know this also!

09:12.240 --> 09:18.080
Did he smell like boat, boat wood, or pineapples, or, uh, panning lotion?

09:18.080 --> 09:18.880
Faintly of coconut.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.600
Like, if you want to know the answer, it's faintly of coconut.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.440
Shit, do you think that that's a scent that he applies to himself,

09:25.440 --> 09:30.320
or you think just his DNA has sort of absorbed enough of this banana boat?

09:30.320 --> 09:34.160
He was bitten by a radioactive coconut at some point in his life.

09:34.160 --> 09:38.880
If the greatest thing about, uh, the, I don't, I keep saying the greatest thing,

09:38.880 --> 09:45.360
but, like, one of the highlights is how deeply into Hamilton Jimmy Buffett is.

09:45.360 --> 09:50.400
To these, like, my, my, Cindy was seated next to James throughout Ham-

09:50.400 --> 09:56.080
for the performance of Hamilton, and she heard him, like, singing along with several numbers.

09:56.080 --> 10:00.480
So, like, my wife is probably the only person who's heard, like, the Jimmy Buffett covers.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.600
God damn, release that album, Jimmy!

10:03.600 --> 10:06.880
I know. How about that, that album? Where's that album?

10:06.880 --> 10:07.520
Yeah.

10:07.520 --> 10:12.320
Um, that, a couple people, because Lynn and Jimmy were in the same area,

10:12.320 --> 10:14.960
were suggesting, like, you guys got to do something together.

10:14.960 --> 10:18.160
And I, all I could think was, like, what the fuck would that be, exactly,

10:18.160 --> 10:19.840
if Lynn and Jimmy collaborated on something?

10:19.840 --> 10:22.560
And then I realized it would be the My Brother, My Brother, Me musical.

10:22.560 --> 10:28.960
That is, like, literally the only, like, Venn diagram section of that that could exist.

10:29.680 --> 10:33.360
Um, but anyway, it was great, and I don't want to bloviate about it anymore,

10:33.360 --> 10:37.040
because it was, uh, uh, but it was, but I did appreciate that, like,

10:37.040 --> 10:38.880
I was seated with them for both shows, so, like,

10:39.440 --> 10:43.760
there are a lot of people around Chicago that have, like, inexplicable pictures of me.

10:43.760 --> 10:49.280
Just, like, weird pictures of me, like, losing my mind, uh, uh, in the general radius.

10:49.280 --> 10:54.800
So I apologize to anybody that I was, uh, making weird faces in your cool pictures.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.400
Anyway, let's start the show, because we, we still have to do this advice podcast.

10:58.400 --> 11:06.160
I haven't bought my, uh, my, my villa at the Margaritaville Retirement Community quite yet.

11:06.160 --> 11:09.520
Didn't bring it, didn't want to broach the subject, uh, with James.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.120
You didn't think he'd get you in gratis?

11:11.760 --> 11:13.920
See, I feel like he could get me in, right?

11:13.920 --> 11:16.320
Like, if anybody could, he could get me in.

11:16.320 --> 11:19.360
But, like, I feel like he would be, the man's 70 years old,

11:19.360 --> 11:24.000
and came straight from a five-day surf weekend to this show,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.840
flew himself, natch, to this show from a five-day surf weekend.

11:27.840 --> 11:31.360
I feel like he would be very judgmental of me if I tried to retire at 37.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.400
Um, anyway.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.360
How about this question?

11:35.360 --> 11:35.680
Yeah.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.680
I have a favorite pizza place that I go to once a week.

11:40.960 --> 11:44.320
Sorry, I accidentally saw the second email.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.240
We'll get to that, we'll get to that later.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.960
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna skip to that, and then we'll come back.

11:50.960 --> 11:55.120
Well, no, we've given this person a taste of having their question read on the show.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.320
We will do the pizza.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.160
You know what, let's do the second question.

11:58.160 --> 11:58.880
We'll circle back.

11:58.880 --> 11:59.600
We'll do the pizza question.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.320
We'll circle back.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.400
Because I don't think we're gonna have that much to add.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.600
Second question is this.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.120
How do I take it to the next level?

12:07.120 --> 12:07.920
That's from Gmail.

12:09.760 --> 12:15.280
I included this because I'm very excited to pitch my idea for next year's,

12:15.280 --> 12:16.400
next year's theme.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.400
L of 18, taking it to the next level.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.000
All right, all right, all right.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.680
I feel like, I feel like the theme for 2018, we need to be, we need to be realistic about

12:27.680 --> 12:31.600
how well we have sort of followed through on past year's themes.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.640
Because I don't know that we've kept things especially serpentine.

12:34.640 --> 12:39.440
I don't think we especially fixed nothing in 2016.

12:39.440 --> 12:39.840
God, no.

12:39.840 --> 12:43.920
I would say shit done broke a little bit more than average.

12:44.640 --> 12:45.920
20 grift team, we were on it.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.920
I feel like 20 grift team, we stayed on it.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.000
Can we really stick with L of 18?

12:50.000 --> 12:56.320
Um, I would love, I just feel like it's too early to, I can't transition into the next

12:56.320 --> 12:56.800
year yet.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.560
We still have two months to zag on them.

12:58.560 --> 12:58.960
Yeah.

12:58.960 --> 13:06.800
I know, I love this theme, but like, like, two days ago, our buddy Lynn got up on stage

13:06.800 --> 13:12.240
with Jimmy Buffett and sang Margaritaville to raise money for AIDS research.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.880
Like, I think we're, I'm still zagging.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.920
Like, I have not left the zag behind.

13:17.920 --> 13:18.960
The zag is still alive.

13:18.960 --> 13:23.600
I can, I can give you the second one that I came up with, which actually fits what you're

13:23.600 --> 13:26.560
discussing now, which is percolate teen, letting it simmer.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.400
Okay, that's so achievable, which I do like.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.400
Yeah, because that's my day to day.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.320
Also, there's a lot of things that rhyme with eight.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.560
So maybe, again, let's just take some time.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.320
Okay, but those are my two front runners.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.200
I want to make it clear.

13:39.200 --> 13:43.840
L of 18, take it to the next level, or percolate teen, letting it simmer.

13:43.840 --> 13:48.160
And what, and what I love about those two is that they are diametrically opposed to

13:48.160 --> 13:48.800
each other.

13:48.800 --> 13:53.360
And I'm also now realizing I might be misinformed on what percolating is.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.920
It might not be like a slow simmer.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.000
No, let's get it percolating.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
That means it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's elevating, but much slower than.

14:02.000 --> 14:02.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.720
How do I take it to the next level though?

14:04.720 --> 14:06.880
Cause I think there's a, can I say this?

14:06.880 --> 14:08.800
There's a lot of bad ways to take next level party.

14:08.800 --> 14:09.200
Oh yeah.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.240
Party drugs.

14:10.240 --> 14:16.400
What about just do everything like you're doing stuff already, right?

14:16.400 --> 14:16.960
Uh huh.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.520
Just almost never, I want, I do disagree with that.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.120
I'm almost never doing stuff.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.880
You're doing some stuff.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.600
Just do it harder and twice.

14:26.240 --> 14:32.000
Like if you do every, you take everything you do today, except to it harder and twice,

14:32.000 --> 14:33.680
you're going to be elevating.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.560
You're going to be reaching the next level very easily.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.040
I ate that chili last night.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.000
Last night was chili night.

14:40.000 --> 14:40.880
So I can tell you one thing.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.240
I'm going to be doing harder and twice.

14:42.240 --> 14:47.440
Griffin, again, you've been eating chili.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.320
Griffin, Andrew McElroy.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.880
It's got beef and beans and tomatoes in it.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.400
You know it's my fave three.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.600
You don't, don't lecture to me about the value of chili.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.160
Okay?

14:58.160 --> 14:59.600
Yes, obviously.

14:59.600 --> 15:00.560
Chili's amazing.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.160
It's one of the two foods I can eat.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.400
Griffin, you have to stop eating chili.

15:04.400 --> 15:08.400
It's like if Superman kept coming on our podcast to talk about how he eats kryptonite.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.200
It's like Superman, stop fucking eating the kryptonite.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.040
It's so good, it's got beans in it.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.080
It's my favorite flavor.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.200
Like if Batman came on, he's like, what are you doing today, Batman?

15:17.200 --> 15:19.040
Just thinking about my dead parents.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.040
Well, you should stop doing that, Batman.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.800
Let me offer another suggestion of how to take it to the next level.

15:25.360 --> 15:25.760
Okay.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.600
Two words, hype person.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.320
Too expensive.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.000
In this economy, no way.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.280
Well, maybe you could barter it.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.440
You know, like hype person for each other.

15:35.440 --> 15:36.720
I'll hype person for you.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.240
You hype person for me.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.720
Just have a, don't, don't pay another person.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.640
You can't afford that in this economy.

15:42.640 --> 15:46.960
Just have a boom box that is constantly playing get ready for this by Too Unlimited.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.760
For everything you are doing, like you're jumping hurdles.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.280
Have Too Unlimited in the background.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.520
You're making pizza for your family.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.480
Too Unlimited.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.600
Just pump it up.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.040
Just pump it up.

15:59.040 --> 16:02.240
And a hand mirror, and you can be your own hype person.

16:03.040 --> 16:07.680
Now that's getting some stranger things upside down territory.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.760
Like you look in your mirror and you're like, you're doing great.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.880
You know, and it's just a nice positive affirmation.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.840
The more you can look in the mirror and say, I'm amazing.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.360
That's what I do every day.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.080
And I'm fucking so many levels above.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.200
Multiple times a day.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.360
We actually have to pause the podcast so Travis can do it.

16:23.360 --> 16:23.680
Yeah.

16:23.680 --> 16:27.040
Well, he keeps the mirror around because he says it helps him in case there's a Medusa.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.200
And I don't disagree.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.880
And I'm glad, like, I know that I have at least one brother who won't be turned to stone.

16:32.880 --> 16:33.520
Take that.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.640
I want to hear a yahoo.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.360
But Griffin, first I wanted to mention to anybody who wasn't aware.

16:37.360 --> 16:42.560
Uh, we are going to be, uh, coming to the Midwest this week.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.320
Fuck, it's so soon.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.960
Uh, we're going to be doing Chicago, Minneapolis, Milwaukee.

16:48.960 --> 16:52.880
We have already sold out of one of the Chicago shows and the Minneapolis shows.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.680
If you want to come to Chicago, uh, please come.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.680
It's going to be a very fun show.

16:57.680 --> 17:01.120
It's going to be our first one of the tour and it's going to be hype.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.640
I think there's going to be a lot of hype energy.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.240
We're going to take it to the next level.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.240
We're going to take it to the next level, basically.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.560
Um, and, and Milwaukee is going to be the last one.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.800
So we're just going to be leaving it all out on the table.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.880
There are the bookends and you got to come see them.

17:12.880 --> 17:17.280
McElroy shows dot com slash tours and you can get tickets for those.

17:17.280 --> 17:18.480
Please come.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.840
We would love to see you.

17:19.840 --> 17:24.480
Uh, there's a lot of great seats available at the first Chicago show.

17:24.480 --> 17:27.760
Especially Milwaukee is running low, but Chicago, there's a lot of seats available.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.480
So please, please, please, please, please, please come.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.520
We would really love to see you.

17:32.160 --> 17:32.720
All right.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.440
You got it.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.080
Thanks, Griffin.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.120
I'm glad you're going to be there.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.720
Um, here's a Yahoo from Seth Carlson.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.200
Thank you, Seth.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.440
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

17:39.440 --> 17:43.120
But, uh, JK Simmons is up in a farmer's insurance ad at the top of the screen.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.320
So it is JK Simmons.

17:44.880 --> 17:47.680
And it's great that it's JK Simmons because the question is,

17:47.680 --> 17:52.640
can celebrities and normal people have their own separate heavens when they die?

17:54.080 --> 17:55.600
Let me put it to y'all this way.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.480
Celebrities are different people.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.800
No matter how human beings they become.

18:01.360 --> 18:01.760
Whoa.

18:01.760 --> 18:07.360
Whoa, no matter, no matter how human beings they become while being in the spotlight with

18:07.360 --> 18:11.040
millions and millions of people watching them from all over the world.

18:11.040 --> 18:14.960
They cannot do what real normal people do in their everyday life.

18:14.960 --> 18:20.480
When we are normal people, we live in a normal life without having paparazzi and the media

18:20.480 --> 18:22.640
following us around anywhere we go.

18:22.640 --> 18:27.280
When we are normal people, we live our lives anonymously, not publicly.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.360
Did you guys know what a celebrity is?

18:29.360 --> 18:31.360
Because this person's got a whole paragraph.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.040
Yeah, thank you, person.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.680
Even without seeing millions of pictures of yourself all over the web,

18:35.680 --> 18:39.680
and without seeing yourself on Wikipedia, blogs, videos, posters, newspapers, websites,

18:39.680 --> 18:41.040
and all of the above.

18:41.040 --> 18:45.120
Not to mention your full name and date of birth being shown to the whole entire world

18:45.120 --> 18:46.720
where people know that your real full information-

18:46.720 --> 18:49.760
I feel like this person has lost the plot of the original question.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.440
Not to mention your full name and date of birth being shown to the whole entire world

18:53.440 --> 18:57.280
where people know that your real full information and personal life.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.080
Do you agree?

18:58.800 --> 19:00.720
With what part, my dude?

19:00.720 --> 19:01.920
What?

19:01.920 --> 19:04.400
Are you talking about people getting doxxed in heaven?

19:04.400 --> 19:05.760
What are you talking about?

19:05.760 --> 19:10.400
I'm very confused because up till now, I've been led to believe that stars are just like us.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.560
That they get coffee just like us.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.320
They walk their dogs just like us.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.240
They go to the store just like us.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.320
They smell faintly of coconut just like us.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.040
Yeah, so I'm confused.

19:19.040 --> 19:23.280
I have to circle back to the coconut smell because I'm wondering if it's synesthetic in a way.

19:23.280 --> 19:31.280
Like, you see him and you think of his music and the smell and perhaps even the taste of that sweet nut enters your mouth.

19:31.280 --> 19:34.240
I think that maybe it's like a psychotropic effect.

19:34.240 --> 19:39.280
Like, if you put a scientific smeller up, they wouldn't detect it.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.280
But it is entering into your mind space.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.240
Okay, so speaking of James, as long as we're on the topic.

19:44.240 --> 19:50.880
If there's a heaven that I go to and Jimmy Buffett isn't there, that's not heaven for me.

19:50.880 --> 20:03.680
Flip side, if there's a heaven that Jimmy Buffett goes to and he's got some portly lad trying to shove a guitar into his hand so he'll play boat drinks 24 hours a day, that's not heaven for him.

20:03.680 --> 20:13.760
I mean, flip side, I'm at the breakfast buffet because you know it's fucking like Great Wall of China, the breakfast buffet in heaven.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.520
I believe it's pronounced Buffett.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.120
Jesus please us.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.840
It's also up there and he's great.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.760
That's actually the name of the breakfast buffet.

20:21.760 --> 20:22.080
Yeah.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.440
Jesus please us.

20:23.440 --> 20:28.880
And then you're up there and you're on the breakfast buffet and you have to wait in line, but it's a short line.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.920
And who's that next to you in the line?

20:31.920 --> 20:33.760
It's Don Cheadle.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.600
And you're like, oh, wow, Don Cheadle.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.800
That's cool, but I don't really know what.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.520
Did you die?

20:37.520 --> 20:38.320
Did you pass?

20:38.320 --> 20:38.800
Oh, no.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.320
Did I die?

20:40.320 --> 20:41.360
Oh, God.

20:41.360 --> 20:46.720
I'm saying it's uncomfortable sometimes when you see a celeb and you don't know how to interact with them.

20:46.720 --> 20:52.400
If I see Don Cheadle at the breakfast buffet in heaven at Jesus please us, that's going to be uncomfortable for me.

20:52.400 --> 20:58.640
Like, I don't necessarily want to interact with celebrities day in, day out because I feel like I'll do a bad job of it.

20:58.640 --> 21:04.880
Don't you think, Griffin, that a little bit of that discomfort is like, when am I ever going to see Don Cheadle again?

21:04.880 --> 21:08.960
But in heaven, that answer is, I don't know, whenever, like forever.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.960
Whenever you want to see Don Cheadle, I guess.

21:10.960 --> 21:11.200
Yeah.

21:11.200 --> 21:20.240
So like that idea of like, I don't feel like talking to Don Cheadle now, I'll do it any other time in the infinite, you know, expanse of forever.

21:20.240 --> 21:21.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.360
Is this the five people you get to meet in heaven?

21:23.360 --> 21:27.520
Is this like you have to pick the five celebs that like inhabit your heaven?

21:27.520 --> 21:28.880
Is that what this book is about?

21:28.880 --> 21:30.160
I may have misunderstood that.

21:30.160 --> 21:33.120
I didn't think that was the five people you get to meet in heaven.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.320
Like there was a limitation.

21:34.320 --> 21:37.520
I thought it was a book and not an application.

21:37.520 --> 21:41.280
Not like when you got there, St. Peter was like, you got five.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.400
You got five, okay.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.720
And don't laminate the list, am I right?

21:45.440 --> 21:48.560
Because then how do you change- it's a joke from friends.

21:48.560 --> 21:52.000
Travis just got bombed off the list for his friends joke.

21:52.880 --> 21:53.520
That's just a deep-

21:53.520 --> 21:54.080
Oh, pull.

21:54.080 --> 21:54.640
I was just trying to-

21:54.640 --> 21:56.720
So wait a minute, St. Peter, I only get five?

21:56.720 --> 21:57.680
Yeah, you only get five.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.760
Ah, Jesus.

21:59.760 --> 22:00.880
Okay, so you got four.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.440
Wait a minute.

22:01.440 --> 22:05.040
No, I wasn't using- you know, he's around anyway, but that's fine.

22:05.040 --> 22:05.760
You burned one.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.280
You burned- damn it.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.440
Carl damn it from Idaho.

22:09.440 --> 22:10.480
I got you again.

22:11.360 --> 22:14.640
The first person you ask for is infinite persons.

22:14.640 --> 22:18.000
And then you're like, oh, you got it.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.320
Or a funny celebrity impersonator.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.520
Yes, give me Rich Little up there.

22:25.520 --> 22:26.560
I've got all the celebrities.

22:26.560 --> 22:27.680
I've got all the celebs.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.320
I'll take Rich Little, Frank Caliendo-

22:30.320 --> 22:31.440
And nobody else.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.440
Just those two, sucker.

22:33.440 --> 22:34.480
And that's gonna do it for me.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.680
Give my three to Frank.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.680
Give the other three to Frank.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.160
I just want separate heavens for famous people.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.120
They've earned it.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.080
Holy shit.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.600
They don't deserve me to be around them.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.680
They don't- they didn't do nothing to deserve that.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.120
It's heaven, not hell.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.080
Oh, shit.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.560
That's- that's the Twilight Zone twist, right?

22:52.560 --> 22:57.600
Of like, ah, as a celebrity, I'm so excited to have my own private heaven

22:57.600 --> 23:00.400
where I don't have to deal with, like, the adoration.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.480
And then, like, on day three, they're like,

23:02.480 --> 23:05.520
I can't deal with this, like, seclusion.

23:05.520 --> 23:08.640
And I- I like having fans in an audience.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.400
I thought heaven would be great.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.560
And then, like, a dude in a red suit pops up.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.720
He's like, oh, did you think this was heaven?

23:14.720 --> 23:15.360
I got you.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.240
It's heck.

23:16.240 --> 23:16.960
You're in heck.

23:17.680 --> 23:20.640
And they- I mean, the- the choicest thing about celebrity heaven is,

23:20.640 --> 23:22.800
judging by the headlines the past couple weeks,

23:22.800 --> 23:28.080
it is not gonna be as crowded as I assumed it would be just a little bit ago.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.640
I think you're gonna have some room to stretch your legs in there.

23:30.640 --> 23:31.440
All right, here's a question.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.760
I have a favorite pizza place that I go to once a week.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.920
With every pizza you order, they give you a coupon.

23:36.720 --> 23:39.120
Bring back 12 coupons, and you'll get a free pizza.

23:39.120 --> 23:40.400
That's a wild way of doing that.

23:44.240 --> 23:47.200
They just didn't want to spring from one of those punching machines on the card, huh?

23:47.200 --> 23:47.760
All right, that's fine.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.960
Here's a piece of trash.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.440
Bring me 12 pieces of trash, and you get a free pizza.

23:51.440 --> 23:55.360
Yeah, you turn it into a fucking World of Warcraft quest to free- freeze off.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.280
Anyway, I collected all these coupons,

23:57.280 --> 23:59.520
then went in on my birthday for the Frieza.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.240
Good.

24:00.240 --> 24:00.960
Good pimento.

24:00.960 --> 24:01.920
Frieza.

24:01.920 --> 24:02.400
Frieza.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.720
I went in there, I collected my 12 coupons,

24:04.720 --> 24:06.720
and I got the bad guy from Dragon Ball Z.

24:08.160 --> 24:11.760
When the cashier told me the price, I handed him the coupons, and he said,

24:11.760 --> 24:13.600
oh, okay, you have enough of them.

24:13.600 --> 24:14.800
He wasn't annoyed or anything.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.640
He just didn't show any emotion at all,

24:16.640 --> 24:20.240
and it really kind of ruined the mood of excitement about this free pizza.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.840
I know customer service is difficult and annoying and all,

24:23.840 --> 24:26.240
but I think the cashier should have to act excited

24:26.240 --> 24:29.120
when people bring in 12 coupons to not ruin the special moment.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.400
What do you think, brothers?

24:30.400 --> 24:32.320
That's from apprehensive at Appleton.

24:32.320 --> 24:36.240
This is so good, because it is- there's two things going on right here.

24:36.240 --> 24:39.360
One, they are- you are bringing these things in,

24:39.360 --> 24:42.960
and you say, time for you to experience a loss.

24:42.960 --> 24:48.160
Like, time for you to financially surrender yourself to me.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.320
But at the same time, Justin, the World of Warcraft quest,

24:50.320 --> 24:55.040
I can't get that out of my head, because I do want to, like, amazing travel.

24:55.040 --> 25:00.720
Oh, and like, a golden glow, like, surrounds you for a second, you know?

25:01.360 --> 25:03.520
Yeah, you're getting one over on them.

25:03.520 --> 25:04.880
They never thought anyone would do this.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.880
They made it as annoying as humanly possible.

25:06.880 --> 25:10.720
The tough piece is, the coupons are cut in different shapes.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.320
This is not even like you bring them a neat,

25:12.320 --> 25:14.640
even stack of beautiful rectangular paper.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.400
One of them is like a star,

25:16.400 --> 25:19.840
and one of them is like a very, very, very small circle.

25:19.840 --> 25:24.240
Maybe they're bummed because they know that if you're using a coupon for a Frieza,

25:24.240 --> 25:28.880
the chances of you tipping have been reduced to nil.

25:28.880 --> 25:32.080
Maybe that's the lack of excitement about that.

25:32.080 --> 25:33.040
You gotta tip.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.800
Even on a Frieza, y'all know that, right?

25:34.800 --> 25:36.240
Y'all gotta tip on everything.

25:36.240 --> 25:36.640
Okay.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.400
You tip on a carryout, right?

25:38.400 --> 25:39.360
You guys tip on a carryout?

25:39.360 --> 25:43.600
I do now, because I joked once about not doing it,

25:43.600 --> 25:45.760
and many people were like, you have to.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.200
And I was like, oh, okay.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.560
And now I do.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.920
That's how suggestible Travis is.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.840
Maybe they didn't do enough at once.

25:53.840 --> 25:56.880
What I'm saying is like, if you order six pizzas,

25:56.880 --> 26:00.480
and they're like, oh, hell yeah, what a great day,

26:00.480 --> 26:02.800
and then you bring in 72 coupons,

26:02.800 --> 26:08.400
and it's like, they're like, so that'll be basically $150.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.760
And you're like, oh, well, basically, the prestige.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.640
And then you bring out like 72 coupons.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.520
That's gonna get a reward.

26:15.520 --> 26:16.800
Or you open a briefcase,

26:16.800 --> 26:19.680
and you have all of them banded together in the briefcase,

26:19.680 --> 26:21.920
and you're just like, I'll pay for it with this.

26:21.920 --> 26:28.480
Assuming you get a coupon for the Frieza for the Goku,

26:28.480 --> 26:33.360
if you get an eat right there, 144 pizzas,

26:34.320 --> 26:37.680
you will then get 12 coupons just from the Friezas

26:37.680 --> 26:40.240
that you can use to get another Frieza.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.400
Ladies and gentlemen, I have just figured out

26:42.400 --> 26:44.160
the infinite pizza equation.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.680
I'm pretty sure if you just do 144,

26:47.680 --> 26:50.240
you will generate an infinite engine,

26:50.240 --> 26:55.360
and you have built an engine of pizza building

26:55.360 --> 26:57.600
that is infinite.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.400
Infinite pizza.

27:00.080 --> 27:03.840
There's another pepperoni perpetual moment.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.600
I'm trying to get like a perpetual moment.

27:05.600 --> 27:06.400
There's nothing in there.

27:09.200 --> 27:09.920
Keep going.

27:09.920 --> 27:10.560
I'll get there.

27:10.560 --> 27:11.840
Each pizza costs $10.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.680
It's $1,440.

27:13.680 --> 27:14.880
That's a lot, right?

27:16.080 --> 27:18.080
It's a lot of money to invest in something.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.640
But then mathematically, I ran the numbers infinite pizza.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.240
So just think about it.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.400
What you do is you donate those pizzas

27:24.400 --> 27:26.960
to like a local shelter or a library or something,

27:26.960 --> 27:28.480
and then you also get on BuzzFeed.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.720
Yeah, yeah.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.560
And then people will donate you more money

27:33.120 --> 27:35.840
to buy 144 new pizzas.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.000
And then I started to joke.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.760
You invest those pizzas,

27:39.760 --> 27:42.640
and you use that interest to buy more pizzas.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.160
But you got to be careful because again,

27:44.160 --> 27:46.000
guys, the economy, fuck.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.840
Oh, you build that pizza bubble?

27:47.840 --> 27:48.320
Ugh.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.240
We haven't talked about the economy in a while,

27:50.240 --> 27:54.400
but I feel like it's really off the rails a little bit.

27:54.960 --> 27:57.360
Yeah, and this economy is in the toilet.

27:58.560 --> 27:59.600
Or is it good now?

28:00.160 --> 28:01.760
I don't even know where the economy is.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.120
That's how off the rails it is.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.720
Because it could be good or it could be bad,

28:04.720 --> 28:07.040
and there's no way of tracking it.

28:07.040 --> 28:08.640
It should not have come as a surprise to you.

28:08.640 --> 28:09.920
This person would not be excited

28:09.920 --> 28:12.560
if you'd ever watched any of the many extreme couponing

28:12.560 --> 28:14.720
television programs that are available to you,

28:14.720 --> 28:19.120
which I would highly attempt to deter you from.

28:19.120 --> 28:21.200
It is not an enjoyable way of spending time.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.080
But the grand finale of those shows

28:24.080 --> 28:27.520
is always someone meticulously handing over

28:28.160 --> 28:32.800
like 150 coupons to get all this free toilet paper

28:32.800 --> 28:34.800
they could ever want for their butt.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.000
And the person who is on the receiving end of that

28:38.000 --> 28:39.120
behind the register,

28:41.040 --> 28:42.560
you can watch them learning

28:42.560 --> 28:46.320
that they lack the capability of killing someone with their mind.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.880
Because that is what they are attempting to do,

28:49.520 --> 28:53.360
is to try to stop this person's heart with their eyeballs.

28:53.920 --> 28:57.360
Because they are not gized about the way they're spending time.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.200
I think if that's your position,

28:59.200 --> 29:01.120
you should be able to grill them

29:01.120 --> 29:04.800
on what they're going to be using all of this stuff for.

29:04.800 --> 29:09.760
For instance, oh yeah, you really got one over on us this time.

29:09.760 --> 29:13.920
Boy, you must be doing some heavy duty shits to need this much, huh?

29:13.920 --> 29:15.600
Tell me everything about that.

29:15.600 --> 29:19.760
Boy, you guys really love mustard.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.200
Put it on everything, huh?

29:21.920 --> 29:22.560
Drink some of that.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.280
Hey, drink a whole-

29:23.280 --> 29:24.080
I'll let you do this

29:24.080 --> 29:27.120
because you've got the right pieces of paper from the newspaper.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.880
Boy, this is a fucked up shitty system.

29:28.880 --> 29:32.320
But go ahead and drink a whole container of mustard for me right now.

29:32.320 --> 29:33.760
And we'll get the bathroom ready for you

29:33.760 --> 29:37.280
because apparently it disagrees with you.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.520
You better start eating those pickles right now.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.080
If you're going to eat them before they expire, go on.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.640
Open a jar of pickles and eat it in front of me.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.640
I got a lot of coupons this game.

29:46.640 --> 29:47.040
And I need something to entertain me.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.240
I got plenty of time.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.960
Get one of those spicy boys out

29:50.960 --> 29:53.040
and get your crunch on right in front of me.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.720
Entertain me, pickle lover.

29:54.720 --> 29:55.840
You've never seen-

29:55.840 --> 29:57.040
I love watching-

29:57.040 --> 30:00.080
There's certain moments on the Extreme Couponing shows

30:00.080 --> 30:04.880
where you can actually watch the cashiers' worldview crumble around them

30:05.440 --> 30:06.800
when they ring all of them in

30:06.800 --> 30:10.800
and realize that somehow through the machinations of this clipper,

30:11.520 --> 30:13.680
they owe money back to the person.

30:14.320 --> 30:15.680
It's rare, but it does happen.

30:15.680 --> 30:18.080
It's like, according to this, I owe you five dollars.

30:18.880 --> 30:22.880
And like in that moment, they cease to unders-

30:22.880 --> 30:26.080
Like you can watch this person realize they have no idea

30:26.080 --> 30:32.160
how capitalism or barter and trade or the world itself works.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.560
And I just assume after that they go live in the woods.

30:34.560 --> 30:38.560
Oh, full blown hunter forager, like done, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

30:38.560 --> 30:41.600
Yeah, I've seen too much and I've seen it

30:41.600 --> 30:43.760
and the shine came off the capitalism apple.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.200
I'm in the woods now, see ya.

30:45.840 --> 30:47.520
The other great thing about those shows

30:47.520 --> 30:50.080
is when the person gives you a tour of their stocks

30:50.080 --> 30:51.360
that they've gotten with it.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.200
And there's always a shot where it's like,

30:53.200 --> 30:56.160
and over here I've got 30 cans of peas

30:56.800 --> 31:00.880
and I wish the camera would just like stay on them

31:00.880 --> 31:04.560
like straight for like three minutes, like not move.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.240
Just like force them to stand there

31:06.240 --> 31:09.200
and confront the fact that they will die someday.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.800
And when they do, they will have peas just litter.

31:12.800 --> 31:13.680
They're gonna have to-

31:13.680 --> 31:15.520
Your children are gonna have to-

31:16.800 --> 31:19.360
God damn, how many boxes of expired peas

31:19.360 --> 31:21.440
do we have to carry out before the estate sale?

31:21.440 --> 31:24.240
I am Ozymandias, look upon my peas.

31:25.120 --> 31:28.000
But then you realize that and you say,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.320
and maybe this is how we elevate teen.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.880
You say, I'm not gonna let these peas outlive me.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.560
It's peas morning, noon and night.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.560
We're getting British up in here.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.960
It's all peas all the way down, baby.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.800
You try to kill me, peas?

31:40.800 --> 31:42.320
You try to outlive me, peas?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.880
Oh shit, we got fucking 20 crates.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.040
We have two metric tons of toilet paper

31:49.040 --> 31:51.200
and I'm fucking 58 years old.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.720
Let's get fucking going.

31:52.720 --> 31:54.080
Crampies, crampies, crampies.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.280
Yeah, I need those.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.640
Hey plumber, plumber, get over here.

31:58.640 --> 31:59.840
I need those wide pipes

31:59.840 --> 32:02.160
because I'm gonna die in 20 to 30 years

32:02.160 --> 32:03.520
according to medical science.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.520
Maybe these peas will keep me alive a little bit longer.

32:05.520 --> 32:08.160
I'm not gonna let this bastard toilet paper outlive me.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.000
You hear me, toilet paper?

32:10.000 --> 32:10.880
Get over here, plumber.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.560
I need double pipes, two toilets.

32:12.560 --> 32:12.960
Let's go.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.040
What do you kids want for dinner tonight?

32:15.040 --> 32:16.240
A split pea soup.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.840
Oh, you want me to split the peas

32:17.840 --> 32:20.080
and therefore effectively double the number of peas?

32:20.080 --> 32:21.920
I fucking think not, Jeremy.

32:21.920 --> 32:22.960
I think not.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.800
You're gonna have your usual peas

32:24.800 --> 32:27.760
shaped into a hamburger shape on a pea bun.

32:27.760 --> 32:28.480
Get to eating.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.320
And then you're gonna go shit, Jeremy,

32:30.880 --> 32:31.920
because we got to.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.600
We all need to chip in here.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.760
You're gonna make yourself...

32:35.760 --> 32:38.720
I know I've always told you to not make the mummy hand,

32:38.720 --> 32:41.840
but I am issuing a house-wide decree.

32:41.840 --> 32:44.800
Everyone mummy hands for their toilet paper usage.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.080
Everybody has to mummy hand.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.040
We're gonna get through this.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.680
You got any teachers that are real pieces of shit?

32:49.680 --> 33:01.840
Here's the perfect time to go to the money sound.

33:01.840 --> 33:04.640
Our first sponsor this week is MeUndies.

33:04.640 --> 33:05.280
MeUndies.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.280
I don't like when they include language in these,

33:07.280 --> 33:08.480
but I'm just gonna have to say it.

33:09.600 --> 33:10.640
MeUndies makes your...

33:11.440 --> 33:12.720
Makes undies that your...

33:14.400 --> 33:15.120
butt.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.920
Oh, yuck!

33:17.920 --> 33:19.920
And we're not the only ones who love MeUndies.

33:20.640 --> 33:24.080
Listen to what longtime listener and MeUndies enthusiast,

33:24.080 --> 33:25.120
Christian, has to say.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.600
Okay, this is from a listener of ours named Christian.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.520
It says, MeUndies changed my life.

33:29.520 --> 33:33.600
No longer do I suffer from uncomfortable scratchy cloth

33:33.600 --> 33:34.800
like I did before.

33:34.800 --> 33:38.640
I now look forward to putting on my MeUndies every morning.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.400
It's like riding on a cloud.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.720
And though I'm married, no one holds me better.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.200
That's lovely, Christian.

33:45.200 --> 33:46.880
That's basically a haiku.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.160
So thank you so much for that.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.000
You can be like Christian.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.760
Do you think there's someone at MeUndies

33:51.760 --> 33:54.480
whose job is specifically to come up with ads

33:54.480 --> 33:56.080
just for my brother and my brother and me?

33:56.080 --> 33:58.000
I think they gotta have their own dedication.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.640
They were like, they can't handle the pressure

34:00.640 --> 34:02.800
of talking about the underwear themselves.

34:02.800 --> 34:05.440
You can get 20% off the best and softest underwear and socks

34:05.440 --> 34:07.280
you will ever own with free shipping

34:07.280 --> 34:11.040
and a 100% satisfaction guarantee

34:11.040 --> 34:13.840
when you go to MeUndies.com slash my brother.

34:13.840 --> 34:17.200
That's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

34:17.200 --> 34:18.320
I also just want to say,

34:18.320 --> 34:20.560
because it doesn't get enough credit,

34:20.560 --> 34:23.280
they also now have bralettes and hoodies

34:23.280 --> 34:25.760
and sleep pants and t-shirts.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.040
Go check it out.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.440
I want to tell you about NatureBox.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.120
When it comes to eating better,

34:32.880 --> 34:34.960
it feels like sometimes when you're snacking down,

34:34.960 --> 34:36.400
it's either you make a decision.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.160
Do you want delicious and billion calories

34:38.160 --> 34:39.920
or do you want boring and tasteless food?

34:39.920 --> 34:41.040
I say fuck both those.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.240
And NatureBox also says that.

34:42.240 --> 34:43.760
It says right here, fuck both those.

34:43.760 --> 34:47.920
Because you can snack good and even better with NatureBox.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.600
They got over 100 snacks that taste good

34:49.600 --> 34:50.480
and are better for you.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.560
And they're all made from high quality, simple ingredients

34:52.560 --> 34:54.880
with no artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners.

34:55.440 --> 34:56.320
I talk about all the time.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.600
I like that Big Island Pineapple.

34:57.600 --> 35:00.720
Do you think that that is Jimmy's favorite also

35:00.720 --> 35:01.760
is the Big Island Pineapple?

35:01.760 --> 35:02.480
I mean, he probably-

35:02.480 --> 35:03.680
You have to imagine.

35:03.680 --> 35:06.880
He probably has his own sort of wet pineapple.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.360
These are delicious, huge dried pineapple rings.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.080
He has his own probably wet pineapple solutions.

35:12.080 --> 35:13.840
But I bet he'd still get down on these.

35:13.840 --> 35:14.960
They add new snacks every month

35:14.960 --> 35:16.080
and they're shipped right to your door.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.400
They will replace snacks you don't like for free.

35:18.400 --> 35:19.760
And right now NatureBox is offering

35:19.760 --> 35:20.960
My Brother, My Brother, and Me fans

35:20.960 --> 35:22.240

35:22.240 --> 35:24.000

35:24.000 --> 35:25.680
That's naturebox.com slash my brother

35:25.680 --> 35:27.200
for 50% off your first order.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.840
One last time, naturebox.com slash my brother.

35:30.560 --> 35:33.920
Got a message here for Rosemary Trevail.

35:33.920 --> 35:34.960
I don't know why you had to say it

35:34.960 --> 35:36.560
like you're at a Ren Fair.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.160
I just really like that name.

35:38.160 --> 35:39.200
There's a lot to that.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.480
One, it's got Trav in it, which-

35:40.480 --> 35:42.560
You know that's the best.

35:42.560 --> 35:46.080
Yeah, but also it's just a beautiful name.

35:46.080 --> 35:46.640
It's a good name.

35:47.360 --> 35:48.960
It's from Craig.

35:48.960 --> 35:51.040
Oh, don't say Craig's name like that

35:51.040 --> 35:53.200
after we're giving Rosemary the Shakespeare.

35:53.200 --> 35:56.080
Well, I'm gonna go with Gregory Jamonson.

35:56.640 --> 35:58.160
That's okay, Gregory.

35:58.160 --> 35:58.960
That's you now.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.480
Gregory Jamonson.

36:01.440 --> 36:03.040
And Gregory writes,

36:03.040 --> 36:05.600
I don't know what day this will be read on

36:06.160 --> 36:07.520
or even what month,

36:07.520 --> 36:09.920
but we shall get snacks tonight.

36:10.480 --> 36:13.040
Parenthetical, you are the best.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.200
Love, Gregory.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.640
I don't know about this character, Trav.

36:16.640 --> 36:18.320
I feel like he needs some third-

36:18.320 --> 36:21.600
My name is Jumbo Tron.

36:22.560 --> 36:23.760
And when I say that,

36:23.760 --> 36:25.760
I think maybe I should be a robot man instead.

36:25.760 --> 36:26.560
Yeah, start him over.

36:26.560 --> 36:27.360
Start him over.

36:27.360 --> 36:27.920
Okay.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.560
This message is for Rosemary Trevail.

36:30.560 --> 36:32.400
Jumbo Tron, you're back.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.880
It's from Craig.

36:34.880 --> 36:36.800
Well, don't read the message a second time, Jumbo.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.080
Don't read it a second time, Jumbo Tron.

36:38.080 --> 36:38.800
I don't know.

36:38.800 --> 36:39.680
I know.

36:39.680 --> 36:40.800
Let me try the next one.

36:40.800 --> 36:41.840
You got a virus from-

36:41.840 --> 36:45.040
This message is for Bevin,

36:45.760 --> 36:47.840
like Kevin with B.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.000
It's from Chris and Sarah.

36:52.640 --> 36:53.680
I feel like we could do-

36:53.680 --> 36:55.120
To Bevin.

36:55.120 --> 36:55.440
Okay.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.760
Master of Psychology.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.520
I'm losing it now.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.080
Yeah, you are a little bit.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.040
I'm just melting.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.600
You fought off the demons of anxiety,

37:03.600 --> 37:06.560
persevered over the terrors of academia,

37:06.560 --> 37:10.560
and created one incredible kick-ass thesis,

37:11.120 --> 37:13.360
all while being an amazing friend and partner.

37:13.360 --> 37:16.000
Thank you for letting us bask in your glory.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.280
We loved being your companions for these adventures

37:19.280 --> 37:21.920
and look forward to the ones to come.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.920
See, Jumbo Tron couldn't have delivered

37:23.920 --> 37:25.200
an emotional message like that,

37:25.200 --> 37:25.680
because-

37:25.680 --> 37:26.800
Well, he is real-

37:26.800 --> 37:27.760
Here's what you don't know, Griffin.

37:27.760 --> 37:29.040
His love is not real.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.000
What you don't know, Griffin,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.160
is halfway when my voice changed,

37:32.160 --> 37:34.080
that is when I Bicentennial-manned.

37:34.080 --> 37:36.240
Oh, you got a penis.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.560
Yeah, Jumbo Tron got a penis.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.560
You got a penis that can cum in everything.

37:40.560 --> 37:44.000
That's my favorite line from that movie,

37:44.000 --> 37:47.520
is Oliver Platt gives him a penis,

37:47.520 --> 37:48.640
and he's like, can it cum?

37:48.640 --> 37:50.720
And Oliver's like, it can cum in everything.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.640
Cum in everything or cum and everything?

37:54.640 --> 37:55.520
Cum and everything.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.520
And Bicentennial Man then says like,

37:57.520 --> 37:58.880
oh, like a real penis.

38:00.000 --> 38:00.560
Cool.

38:00.560 --> 38:01.200
Cool.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.640
So great job, Bevan.

38:06.480 --> 38:07.680
What is the everything?

38:09.200 --> 38:11.120
Pee and, you know.

38:11.120 --> 38:11.920
And whistle.

38:11.920 --> 38:12.720
Whistle.

38:12.720 --> 38:13.920
Look just cool.

38:17.360 --> 38:18.880
Well, no.

38:18.880 --> 38:19.760
No, not really.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.400
Oh, sorry about that.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.640
Just had to dispatch some goons real quick.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.080
Hi, I'm April Wolf,

38:28.080 --> 38:29.600
lead film critic at LA Weekly.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.200
And when I'm not kicking butt,

38:31.200 --> 38:33.440
I'm hosting the new maximum fun podcast,

38:33.440 --> 38:34.640
Switchblade Sisters.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.240
Do you love genre films?

38:36.240 --> 38:38.080
Do you love female filmmakers?

38:38.080 --> 38:39.680
Do you love discussions on craft?

38:39.680 --> 38:40.880
If your answer is yes,

38:40.880 --> 38:42.720
you'll love Switchblade Sisters.

38:42.720 --> 38:45.360
Every episode, I invite one female filmmaker on

38:45.360 --> 38:48.000
and we talk in depth about their fave genre film

38:48.000 --> 38:49.760
and how it influenced their own work.

38:49.760 --> 38:53.120
So we're talking horror, action, sci-fi, fantasy,

38:53.120 --> 38:55.120
bizarro and exploitation cinema.

38:55.120 --> 38:56.800
Mothers, lock up your sons

38:56.800 --> 38:59.360
because the Switchblade Sisters are coming for you.

38:59.360 --> 39:01.440
Available at maximumfun.org

39:01.440 --> 39:03.360
or wherever you find your podcasts.

39:05.600 --> 39:06.480
How about this one?

39:06.480 --> 39:07.760
It's sent in by Jace Parker.

39:07.760 --> 39:08.320
Thank you, Jace.

39:08.320 --> 39:09.920
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.120
Yasin, who asks,

39:13.200 --> 39:15.600
what if we can breath in space

39:15.600 --> 39:17.760
but the government tells us we can't

39:17.760 --> 39:19.760
so we don't try to escape?

39:20.560 --> 39:21.200
Hell yeah.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.000
What if we can breath in space

39:24.000 --> 39:25.440
but the government tells us we can't

39:25.440 --> 39:27.520
so we don't try to escape?

39:27.520 --> 39:28.020
Earth?

39:28.020 --> 39:29.460
Earth, like we don't try to-

39:29.460 --> 39:29.960
Earth?

39:30.660 --> 39:31.620
By earth-

39:31.620 --> 39:33.620
Earth is the biggest prison.

39:33.620 --> 39:34.900
I think we can all agree on that.

39:34.900 --> 39:36.580
Earth is a big prison

39:36.580 --> 39:41.780
and maybe I don't want to be, you know, rained on.

39:43.220 --> 39:44.340
Gross, I shouldn't have to.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.100
I want to go above the rain, up in space

39:46.100 --> 39:47.940
where I definitely can't breathe

39:47.940 --> 39:49.300
but government tells me I can't

39:49.300 --> 39:52.180
because they're up there doing who knows what.

39:52.180 --> 39:54.740
Why would the government want to keep you on earth?

39:54.740 --> 39:55.940
I think that they'd be fine

39:55.940 --> 39:57.780
if you wanted to blast off to new-

39:57.780 --> 39:59.940
Well, because I'm saying space is cool

39:59.940 --> 40:01.940
and we're doing stuff up there, maybe.

40:01.940 --> 40:02.440
Yeah.

40:02.440 --> 40:04.900
Well, we're definitely doing stuff up there, maybe.

40:04.900 --> 40:05.140
Oh yeah.

40:05.140 --> 40:06.100
We can fly around-

40:06.100 --> 40:08.100
You could fly around like Second Life

40:08.100 --> 40:13.060
or, you know, punch an asteroid or-

40:13.060 --> 40:14.900
Maybe they're afraid one of us will get to the moon

40:14.900 --> 40:16.660
and be like, this is mine

40:16.660 --> 40:18.020
and it's like, well, damn it.

40:18.020 --> 40:19.300
Well, shoot, we didn't call-

40:19.300 --> 40:20.580
Nobody called it.

40:20.580 --> 40:22.340
Nobody's called dibs yet on moon.

40:22.980 --> 40:25.460
We should have thought of that when we were there, maybe.

40:25.460 --> 40:26.420
Didn't they call dibs on the-

40:26.420 --> 40:28.260
They put their flag there, right? America was there.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.100
There's a position at NASA, this is not a joke,

40:30.100 --> 40:33.300
at NASA that was hiring in the last few years

40:33.300 --> 40:36.740
that was galactic preservationist

40:36.740 --> 40:43.220
and it was a person who made sure that nobody called the moon.

40:43.220 --> 40:46.420
It was like they made sure that folks were cool

40:46.420 --> 40:48.420
about all the planets and stuff

40:48.420 --> 40:49.940
and nobody tried to get up to some shit.

40:50.740 --> 40:53.780
Did they wait up there with a big space flashlight?

40:53.780 --> 40:57.060
Like, hey, hey- Move it along, move it along.

40:57.060 --> 40:58.980
Try to have sex on Jupiter.

41:00.580 --> 41:02.980
I mean, the only question about that is like,

41:05.060 --> 41:09.220
exactly how many, I'll be generous and say weeks

41:09.220 --> 41:12.100
before Craig, the galactic preservationist, is like,

41:12.100 --> 41:14.660
oh no, this is Craig's moon.

41:14.660 --> 41:15.860
Yeah, yeah, no, for sure.

41:15.860 --> 41:18.180
Like, I fully do have ownership

41:18.180 --> 41:19.780
and jurisdiction over this moon.

41:19.780 --> 41:22.180
And guess what? Jupiter's got like 17 moons.

41:22.180 --> 41:26.020
I'm not gonna claim IO, but I'm gonna get one of the smaller ones that nobody knows the name of.

41:26.660 --> 41:26.980
Kiss me.

41:26.980 --> 41:28.260
The one with all the exotics on it.

41:28.260 --> 41:29.300
Well, yeah.

41:29.300 --> 41:30.340
Off my shorts?

41:30.340 --> 41:30.740
I'm crying.

41:30.740 --> 41:31.860
Okay, Nessus.

41:31.860 --> 41:32.740
Here's the thing.

41:32.740 --> 41:37.780
Can I just say, and this is a bold move, but I think it's gonna stick.

41:39.140 --> 41:40.820
I claim Mercury.

41:40.820 --> 41:41.620
Oh, Trav.

41:42.340 --> 41:42.820
No, no, no.

41:42.820 --> 41:43.380
Hear me out.

41:43.940 --> 41:47.460
I have a very strong sense that when I do that, someone will-

41:47.460 --> 41:50.020
This will be like an Air Bud situation where it's like,

41:50.020 --> 41:52.100
wait, well, that's gotta be against the rules.

41:52.100 --> 41:55.140
And then they'll flip through the book and realize there's no rule

41:55.140 --> 41:58.740
against me claiming Mercury, and it holds up in a court of law.

41:59.700 --> 42:00.740
Mercury's mine.

42:01.460 --> 42:05.140
I'm gonna take Uranus, but just so I can rename it like Cool Planet,

42:05.140 --> 42:06.740
and people can't make the joke anymore.

42:09.460 --> 42:10.340
A good joke, though.

42:10.340 --> 42:11.380
How long will it take me to get there?

42:11.380 --> 42:12.180
Can I Google map?

42:12.980 --> 42:17.780
Now, it'll take me 17 hours to get to Uranus Road in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.

42:17.780 --> 42:22.180
And that is kind of still funny, like Uranus Road.

42:22.180 --> 42:26.740
Like, drive my car, my F-150 into Uranus.

42:28.180 --> 42:29.620
How about another Yahoo?

42:29.620 --> 42:29.940
Do it.

42:29.940 --> 42:30.580
Yeah, sure.

42:30.580 --> 42:33.300
I mean, this one is sent in by Morgan Davies, so let's keep it wavy.

42:33.300 --> 42:35.620
And it's from Yahoo Answers user Cassandra, who asks,

42:36.260 --> 42:38.580
nightmare about a nut head?

42:39.940 --> 42:41.700
Since a few days ago, I keep having this nightmare

42:41.700 --> 42:43.860
about seeing a nut head everywhere.

42:43.860 --> 42:44.900
Wait, what?

42:44.900 --> 42:50.260
It's just a man dressed in casual clothes with a giant nut as a head.

42:50.260 --> 42:54.580
I can't explain what nut it is in shape, but I would say a walnut.

42:55.220 --> 43:00.740
In the dream, I would see him appear to me like a ghost

43:00.740 --> 43:05.060
through house windows from the inside on the ending of a road not too far,

43:05.060 --> 43:08.900
street corners, libraries, fire exit, and other creepy places.

43:08.900 --> 43:11.460
He would disappear two seconds after I spot him.

43:11.460 --> 43:12.820
Other people won't spot him.

43:12.820 --> 43:15.940
It's kind of like those horror movie scenes where they see a ghost of a loved one

43:15.940 --> 43:18.340
or a deceased person from a haunted home,

43:18.340 --> 43:20.820
and only one or two people see it, but others don't.

43:20.820 --> 43:23.940
I get very scared, and I start saying short prayers,

43:23.940 --> 43:26.900
feeling that I haven't seen anything like this in my life.

43:26.900 --> 43:30.260
The dream is very continuous, and does that mean I need deliverance?

43:30.260 --> 43:32.980
He doesn't have eyes, mouth, nose, ears, et cetera,

43:33.780 --> 43:36.980
but I can sense he's looking at me or just in my presence

43:36.980 --> 43:38.260
before I spot him and disappear.

43:38.260 --> 43:39.220
What the fuck?

43:39.220 --> 43:41.060
What do you think can happen next in the dream?

43:41.060 --> 43:43.220
I'm not having any mental problems or disturbances.

43:43.220 --> 43:44.420
You're going to die.

43:44.420 --> 43:46.580
You're going to die from a nut attack.

43:46.580 --> 43:47.940
You have a nut allergy.

43:47.940 --> 43:49.460
That might be the real one.

43:49.460 --> 43:52.180
You have a nut allergy, and this is your body talking to your brain.

43:52.180 --> 43:57.300
Your fucking lungs and your whatever gets bad when you have a nut allergy,

43:57.300 --> 43:59.220
your blood, it's like in your brain, like,

43:59.220 --> 44:01.060
yo, be afraid of walnuts.

44:01.060 --> 44:02.260
Thanksgiving's coming up.

44:02.260 --> 44:03.940
Stay on your toes.

44:05.140 --> 44:05.860
It is weird.

44:05.860 --> 44:07.060
People are always trying to sneak nuts in there.

44:07.060 --> 44:07.540
I know.

44:07.540 --> 44:11.620
It is so weird to be the origin of a creepypasta.

44:13.300 --> 44:17.060
I didn't know what it felt like to be the first person

44:17.060 --> 44:20.820
that someone heard a story from that heard the story from someone,

44:20.820 --> 44:23.620
like with the middleman of a creepypasta.

44:23.620 --> 44:28.340
This is like, okay, in many ways, I think scarier than Slenderman.

44:28.340 --> 44:30.580
I think we have, and this is why I did want to talk about is

44:30.580 --> 44:35.140
I think we could get a lot of profit, a lot of financial profit,

44:35.140 --> 44:39.300
and this bad or good economy, it's good to diversify your portfolio.

44:39.300 --> 44:39.940
Or neutral.

44:39.940 --> 44:42.420
It might be neutral economy, waffle neutral.

44:42.420 --> 44:44.020
I think it's chaotic.

44:44.020 --> 44:45.940
But anyway, it's definitely chaotic.

44:45.940 --> 44:49.620
But anyway, Nuthead, I think, has a lot of potential.

44:50.900 --> 44:52.340
Yeah, we found our offering.

44:53.140 --> 44:55.220
Now, we'll get this dumb show for seven years.

44:55.220 --> 44:58.100
We finally found our platform to get off.

44:58.100 --> 45:00.020
That's kind of just like Nuthead.

45:00.020 --> 45:03.380
The sci-fi original movie Nuthead by the McElroy brothers.

45:03.380 --> 45:06.180
And Nuthead, very scary.

45:06.180 --> 45:11.620
Will we get sued by the Planner's Peanut and all that that's happening?

45:12.260 --> 45:14.260
Are we going to be sued by the Planner's Peanut?

45:14.260 --> 45:17.780
Because he's got a sort of cool style these days.

45:18.580 --> 45:21.380
And I'm worried that maybe we could see some.

45:21.380 --> 45:23.860
Is there a Nuthead out there already that we're going to?

45:23.860 --> 45:27.220
I guess the Ohio State Buckeye mascot is kind of like that.

45:27.780 --> 45:28.820
He's kind of like that.

45:28.820 --> 45:30.980
But it's like, you know what nut that is.

45:30.980 --> 45:33.860
Well, a Buckeye is really more, it's like a seed.

45:34.580 --> 45:37.060
And he's got a warm and inviting face that says like,

45:37.060 --> 45:38.660
it's football time, baby.

45:38.660 --> 45:41.060
This nut doesn't have a face and he doesn't say anything.

45:41.060 --> 45:43.940
Does he carry around big nutcrackers though?

45:43.940 --> 45:47.060
No, I think he's just a, here's the thing.

45:47.060 --> 45:49.700
We could go with a lot of like accessories.

45:49.700 --> 45:53.220
But I think man in a suit, right?

45:54.580 --> 45:56.020
Casual look, casual look.

45:56.020 --> 45:56.980
Casual look.

45:56.980 --> 46:00.500
Yeah, so like a jade through top and some corduroy pants.

46:00.500 --> 46:04.180
But, and just like moves with stillness,

46:04.180 --> 46:07.140
like moves in a very controlled manner.

46:07.700 --> 46:12.340
And it's just ever present in your dream hellscape.

46:13.460 --> 46:15.620
I don't know that he needs any accessories

46:15.620 --> 46:17.620
except maybe a walnut shaped car.

46:18.340 --> 46:21.060
Now that's, now we're on some busy world of Richard's scary

46:21.060 --> 46:23.380
but spelled like S-E-A-R-Y.

46:23.380 --> 46:24.900
Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:24.900 --> 46:27.140
But maybe you don't see that until dream 12.

46:27.140 --> 46:29.300
And like dream one through 11, you're like, oh God, oh God.

46:29.300 --> 46:31.060
Dream 12, he gets in his walnut car,

46:31.060 --> 46:33.140
propeller pops up on top, he flies away,

46:33.140 --> 46:35.460
and he has a fun time in the sky with his worm.

46:35.460 --> 46:38.180
And on 12, you're like, hey, well.

46:38.180 --> 46:40.180
Oh wait, maybe Mr. Nuthead's fun.

46:40.180 --> 46:41.940
But then in dream 13, he's back.

46:41.940 --> 46:44.020
And this time he has a hundred knives.

46:44.020 --> 46:46.420
Yeah, oh, so maybe not Mr. Nuthead.

46:46.420 --> 46:48.420
The thing I don't love about this

46:48.420 --> 46:50.180
that I would wanna tweak this IP

46:50.180 --> 46:52.100
that we've created from a Yahoo answer

46:52.100 --> 46:53.780
is the casual clothes.

46:53.780 --> 46:55.540
That just strikes me as very strange

46:55.540 --> 47:00.540
that you're like Nut Predator would be just in sweats.

47:00.820 --> 47:01.860
Oh shit.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.540
That could be a lot scarier, I think.

47:03.540 --> 47:06.660
Maybe you're invading Nuthead's home in this dream.

47:06.660 --> 47:09.300
You're in Nuthead's dream, right?

47:09.300 --> 47:12.100
So Nuthead, when he's out scaring,

47:12.100 --> 47:14.260
or they, let's say they, let's not assume,

47:14.260 --> 47:18.740
when they're out scaring, they're in full scary tux,

47:18.740 --> 47:19.940
right, or whatever.

47:19.940 --> 47:23.860
And when they're at home, they're in maybe a polo

47:23.860 --> 47:25.940
and some me on these lounge pants.

47:25.940 --> 47:28.260
And it's an interesting look, but it's theirs.

47:28.260 --> 47:30.980
And then they keep looking at you through windows

47:30.980 --> 47:33.060
because they're like, what the fuck?

47:33.060 --> 47:34.500
Oh, she's back, she's back, she's back.

47:35.700 --> 47:38.260
Yeah, Nuthead wakes up in the middle of the night

47:38.260 --> 47:40.260
next to their partner in bed and shakes them

47:40.260 --> 47:42.020
because they had the dream again.

47:42.020 --> 47:46.420
And then Nuthead looks at them and says nothing.

47:46.420 --> 47:47.300
Nothing, Nuthead can't talk.

47:47.300 --> 47:48.820
I mean, I don't have a mouth, but yeah.

47:48.820 --> 47:51.380
Nuthead has to, we have to say Nuthead talking

47:51.380 --> 47:53.460
for like a few films in, I feel like.

47:53.460 --> 47:54.980
I mean, they probably just rattle around

47:54.980 --> 47:56.740
and then Nut bumps up against the husk.

47:56.740 --> 47:58.660
And so it sounds like, you know, and that's,

47:58.660 --> 48:00.660
you know what, very scary.

48:00.660 --> 48:04.260
Like, I love that.

48:04.900 --> 48:08.180
But you know, what is scary except the abnormal?

48:08.180 --> 48:12.900
So to the Nut family, like they're, you know,

48:12.900 --> 48:14.660
rattling around and it's like, yeah, that's normal.

48:14.660 --> 48:17.700
And then they see a human and their face opens up.

48:17.700 --> 48:18.020
Yeah.

48:18.020 --> 48:20.500
And there's like jagged bones and shit in there.

48:20.500 --> 48:21.460
That's terrifying.

48:21.460 --> 48:23.460
A human being's faces are scary as shit.

48:23.460 --> 48:25.060
If Travis, you've got a good point.

48:25.060 --> 48:27.300
I've got, my mouth is full of sharp bones

48:27.300 --> 48:28.900
and a lot of those bones have metal in them

48:28.900 --> 48:31.460
because I eat a lot of Sour Patch Kids.

48:31.460 --> 48:31.960
Right.

48:33.460 --> 48:34.500
And can you imagine that?

48:34.500 --> 48:36.900
Like it's all wet and pink and gross in there.

48:36.900 --> 48:40.180
And you've got this weird like exposed organ in your mouth

48:40.180 --> 48:43.540
that's like, and it can like, it licks.

48:43.540 --> 48:44.660
What's going on with that?

48:44.660 --> 48:45.540
Is it poisonous?

48:45.540 --> 48:46.180
If I'm a Nuthead.

48:46.180 --> 48:47.380
And you eat nuts.

48:47.380 --> 48:48.580
Yeah, you eat nuts.

48:48.580 --> 48:49.460
Nuts don't eat you.

48:49.460 --> 48:53.220
Yeah, if you were eating, even eating Sour Patch Kids

48:53.220 --> 48:54.900
would be hugely disturbing to nuts.

48:54.900 --> 48:56.740
Like they eat the children.

48:56.740 --> 48:56.980
Yeah.

48:56.980 --> 48:59.220
Because they don't know the difference between fruit.

48:59.220 --> 49:01.780
I think this is an important part of the character

49:01.780 --> 49:04.020
is that they're an idiot because it's.

49:06.180 --> 49:07.620
That's the one thing about like,

49:09.140 --> 49:12.820
the good thing about the Nut Man.

49:12.820 --> 49:13.940
Is that what we're calling him?

49:13.940 --> 49:14.980
Nuthead, just Nuthead.

49:14.980 --> 49:18.180
The good thing about Nuthead is he is extremely gullible.

49:18.180 --> 49:20.500
So like, if you turn off the lights in the room,

49:20.500 --> 49:21.780
he's like, I've gone blind.

49:21.780 --> 49:24.340
Yeah, no, he's a very scary idiot.

49:24.340 --> 49:26.660
You know how they talk about like the dinosaurs had a brain

49:26.660 --> 49:28.020
the size of a walnut?

49:28.020 --> 49:28.420
Yeah.

49:28.980 --> 49:33.300
This is what, this, this, this is what they're talking about.

49:33.940 --> 49:36.500
Okay, but it's a large nut, right?

49:36.500 --> 49:37.860
Oh no, it's quite large.

49:37.860 --> 49:40.420
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

49:41.060 --> 49:42.820
What if it's not a big walnut?

49:42.820 --> 49:48.660
You open the window and you're like, oh my God, it's a headless man.

49:48.660 --> 49:51.300
No, no, no, look, there's a little walnut on there.

49:52.740 --> 49:54.340
On a regular size neck?

49:54.340 --> 49:58.340
On a regular size neck, it just tapers up to a walnut.

49:58.340 --> 50:00.180
It's already talking about like steep taper on the neck.

50:00.180 --> 50:00.980
What's scarier?

50:00.980 --> 50:01.700
What's scarier?

50:01.700 --> 50:05.140
Because I think small walnut is much, much, much, much, much, much, much scarier.

50:05.860 --> 50:07.140
Yeah, good luck.

50:07.140 --> 50:11.060
I mean, like, if you see a large nut, you are in a horror situation.

50:11.060 --> 50:13.060
You are going to know that you need to crack it.

50:13.060 --> 50:15.700
Like, it's obvious you need to bury an ax in there.

50:15.700 --> 50:17.940
If it's a small nut, like, good luck.

50:17.940 --> 50:19.060
Good luck, yeah.

50:19.060 --> 50:20.660
Like, you'd have to hold still.

50:20.660 --> 50:24.340
Well, and imagine the scene of like, you look out the window and it, what looks like,

50:24.340 --> 50:26.740
just like a regular walnut sitting on the window sill.

50:26.740 --> 50:28.820
And you're like, oh, somebody left a walnut on my window,

50:28.820 --> 50:30.980
but then it stands up and there's shoulders?

50:30.980 --> 50:31.620
Shoulders.

50:31.620 --> 50:34.100
Get out of town, there's a Travis shaped hole in the wall.

50:34.100 --> 50:39.860
Okay, from a marketing perspective though, is tiny nut head gonna be a lot harder to

50:39.860 --> 50:44.980
cosplay? Because I feel like people are gonna want to bring this character to cons.

50:46.020 --> 50:49.940
It's gonna require head binding and a very, very intense,

50:49.940 --> 50:52.180
you gotta shrink your head down and that's all there is to it.

50:52.180 --> 50:56.420
Let me offer a solution that I think the boys in R&D and marketing are gonna be happy with.

50:57.220 --> 51:06.580
It is a creature with a small nut head, but they wear a helmet that looks like a big nut.

51:06.580 --> 51:08.820
And you don't find that out till maybe movie four.

51:08.820 --> 51:09.540
Um.

51:09.540 --> 51:14.260
So the entire time they've had a small nut in there.

51:14.260 --> 51:14.500
Right.

51:14.500 --> 51:14.740
Okay.

51:15.460 --> 51:21.460
I think we would be remiss in not doing our duty if we did not maybe even explore

51:21.460 --> 51:23.940
the space of what if the head is truck nuts?

51:25.060 --> 51:30.740
Like, I feel like it's our job as doing a comedy podcast, three dudes on it.

51:33.140 --> 51:35.940
Can we not do the Wayans brothers work for them?

51:35.940 --> 51:38.900
Like, they're obviously going to be parodying this with truck nuts.

51:38.900 --> 51:39.300
Yeah.

51:39.300 --> 51:40.500
I don't know that we want to.

51:40.500 --> 51:44.020
I mean, if you want to beat them to the punch for scary movie 80,

51:44.020 --> 51:45.460
like, I'm fine with that.

51:45.460 --> 51:46.660
If you want to go ahead and say, like,

51:46.660 --> 51:47.540
Well, they got options.

51:47.540 --> 51:51.060
You could do nut head and they could do butt head and there's a big butt up in there.

51:51.060 --> 51:52.660
There's a lot of fun stuff.

51:52.660 --> 51:53.140
Who?

51:53.140 --> 51:56.980
I mean, this is the big question that everybody's sort of asking that are on the tip of their

51:56.980 --> 52:01.140
tongue and I did want to hold the cards close to the vest, but I think we should go ahead

52:01.140 --> 52:02.340
and just get it out there.

52:02.340 --> 52:04.180
Who's playing nut head?

52:04.180 --> 52:05.620
Let me Google best actors.

52:05.620 --> 52:08.100
Google best actors because who we like?

52:09.300 --> 52:11.940
Martin Sheen as nut head.

52:14.100 --> 52:15.780
Nobody would see that one coming, I feel like.

52:15.780 --> 52:20.580
And I feel like he needs, you know, he's been out of limelight for a little bit.

52:21.860 --> 52:22.820
Gotta be Viggo.

52:23.860 --> 52:24.660
Oh my God.

52:24.660 --> 52:25.460
Viggo Mortensen.

52:25.460 --> 52:27.780
Gotta be Idris Elba.

52:28.980 --> 52:30.500
Idris Elba is in everything.

52:30.500 --> 52:32.900
I don't like he's way too busy.

52:32.900 --> 52:38.260
But you know who we might be able to have some chance with is Mads.

52:38.820 --> 52:39.140
Yeah.

52:39.140 --> 52:39.860
Gotta get Mads Mikkelsen on this.

52:39.860 --> 52:40.820
Oh my God, Justin.

52:40.820 --> 52:43.860
You are actually doing a very good job at casting nut head.

52:44.580 --> 52:47.940
Like Mads Mikkelsen is nut head.

52:48.820 --> 52:49.460
IRL.

52:49.460 --> 52:50.820
He's real life nut head.

52:50.820 --> 52:57.780
Like I heard he's been looking for a franchise and this could be, I mean, sure he was in,

52:57.780 --> 53:01.860
you know, Doctor Strange and Star Wars and Casino Royale, but like this could be his

53:01.860 --> 53:04.100
franchise that is just Mads.

53:04.100 --> 53:07.620
Cause you know, once he's retired, he's going to want to work the con circuit.

53:08.180 --> 53:13.780
And what better way of establishing those sort of bona fides than with a huge horror

53:14.340 --> 53:15.940
franchise that is all Mads.

53:16.660 --> 53:22.420
I'm worried that we just took the first draft and kind of ran with it.

53:22.420 --> 53:24.260
Cause nut head I think is very good.

53:24.260 --> 53:30.180
Is there another, are there other characters that we could generate here?

53:30.180 --> 53:33.540
Do you mean like a nut head kids club kind of thing?

53:33.540 --> 53:38.820
Well, no, it's maybe before we go all in on nut head is lamp body anything.

53:38.820 --> 53:42.500
And this is a person with Mads Mikkelsen's head and I think we could get better acting

53:42.500 --> 53:43.540
out of him that way.

53:43.540 --> 53:46.980
But then his neck and everything below it is just one very big lamp.

53:46.980 --> 53:49.700
That's sort of the direction I would love to explore.

53:49.700 --> 53:55.460
What you need in a good horror character I think is what you need is the reveal of like,

53:55.460 --> 54:01.380
so maybe it's like, um, the tips of their fingers are micromachines, you know?

54:01.380 --> 54:04.260
So it's like, oh, that's just a normal per- Oh no.

54:04.260 --> 54:05.060
Oh no.

54:05.060 --> 54:06.580
They got micromachines on their fingers.

54:06.580 --> 54:08.420
They got micromachines for feeners.

54:09.460 --> 54:11.060
Is guitar boner anything?

54:11.780 --> 54:12.740
Is that anything?

54:12.740 --> 54:15.140
No, Prince already did that back in the Super Bowl.

54:15.140 --> 54:15.860
You're right.

54:15.860 --> 54:16.820
It's done.

54:16.820 --> 54:17.860
Guitar boner's done.

54:17.860 --> 54:19.620
What about cream cheese feet?

54:19.620 --> 54:21.300
Cream cheese feet is very scary.

54:21.300 --> 54:23.620
Now can they ambulate?

54:23.620 --> 54:26.820
Well, I think they kind of slip and slide all over the place.

54:26.820 --> 54:28.340
That's a bad scary way.

54:28.340 --> 54:28.740
Yeah.

54:28.740 --> 54:29.220
Yeah.

54:29.220 --> 54:30.260
Let me pitch this.

54:30.260 --> 54:32.500
Washboard abs, but literal.

54:32.500 --> 54:32.980
Okay.

54:33.540 --> 54:34.180
Okay.

54:34.180 --> 54:34.820
Okay.

54:34.820 --> 54:35.220
All right.

54:35.780 --> 54:36.740
I love that.

54:36.740 --> 54:39.700
We could probably combine all these for the Avengers style.

54:39.700 --> 54:44.980
I thought you meant in one person with a lamp body, but washboard abs and cream cheese feet

54:44.980 --> 54:46.500
and a walnut for a head.

54:46.500 --> 54:50.340
This is just a big pile of things in my garage.

54:50.340 --> 54:53.380
This character exists in my garage right now.

54:53.380 --> 54:54.100
That's it.

54:54.100 --> 54:55.140
That's the reveal, right?

54:55.140 --> 54:59.380
So, you know, in a movie where it's like you see a scary shadow in the lightning flash

54:59.380 --> 55:00.580
and you're like, oh, that's a person.

55:00.580 --> 55:03.700
And you turn it on and it's just, oh, it's just a pile of things on the chair.

55:03.700 --> 55:06.580
The pile of things on the chair is the killer.

55:07.220 --> 55:08.900
Oh, shit.

55:08.900 --> 55:09.700
Oh, shit.

55:09.700 --> 55:10.180
That's so good.

55:10.180 --> 55:16.100
And maybe Mads is the guy who owns the house and he doesn't realize until it's too late.

55:16.100 --> 55:19.300
And we can call it Mads and the real nut.

55:19.300 --> 55:23.700
And he doesn't maybe because then we get a psychological horror element of is it the lamp

55:23.700 --> 55:25.540
a real, but it is a real.

55:25.540 --> 55:26.660
And it's also played by Mads.

55:26.660 --> 55:29.300
Mads Mikkelsen and Martin Sheen are roommates.

55:29.860 --> 55:30.900
Loving it so far.

55:31.940 --> 55:32.580
In college.

55:32.580 --> 55:32.900
Bring it.

55:32.900 --> 55:33.460
And they've just-

55:33.460 --> 55:35.060
In college, but now.

55:36.180 --> 55:38.180
Yeah, no, they went back because-

55:38.180 --> 55:38.740
They're non-traditional students.

55:38.740 --> 55:43.540
Martin Sheen retired and went back because he wants to get his master's and like-

55:43.540 --> 55:46.980
Because he has to prove to his dad that he can inherit the hotel fortune.

55:46.980 --> 55:48.100
And so he goes back, right?

55:48.100 --> 55:52.340
And Mads realized he never really had a childhood because he was a child star.

55:52.340 --> 55:53.780
And so now he wants to go back to college.

55:54.340 --> 55:55.700
To get his madsters.

55:55.700 --> 55:56.500
Uh-huh.

55:56.500 --> 55:59.860
And they've rented an apartment and-

55:59.860 --> 56:03.220
When does Nuthead even show up in this fucking feature, Travis?

56:03.780 --> 56:08.820
Well, Nuthead comes at the end where Nuthead reaches up and you just see like a hand,

56:08.820 --> 56:11.380
which is actually unidentifiable as Nuthead because-

56:11.380 --> 56:13.380
Okay, hold on, okay, hold on.

56:13.380 --> 56:16.900
Hold on, hold on.

56:16.900 --> 56:18.820
Travis has just suggested an innovation,

56:18.820 --> 56:22.020
which I believe is bigger than Nuthead, bigger than anything.

56:22.740 --> 56:26.980
Where, and it's a secret horror movie.

56:27.620 --> 56:32.660
Seren Dippin, fucking Cusack and Beckonsdale, or Beckonsworth.

56:32.660 --> 56:35.380
No one can remember right now, Griffin can't.

56:35.380 --> 56:37.300
Get together, they put the number in the book.

56:37.300 --> 56:38.900
Oh, fate brought them back to-

56:38.900 --> 56:40.100
While you were sleeping.

56:40.100 --> 56:42.580
You woke up and you got a pencil through his balls,

56:42.580 --> 56:45.300
but I love him and not you and I'm so sorry.

56:45.300 --> 56:49.860
And then Sandy and the other one get in bed and goodnight,

56:49.860 --> 56:57.620
and then a hand reaches up and comes up from under the bed and reaches up

56:57.620 --> 57:02.340
and grabs at the person, grabs at them, grabs at them, it's so scary.

57:02.340 --> 57:06.740
And then it cuts to black and then all the things you say to me,

57:06.740 --> 57:08.260
because I'm one step, you know?

57:08.900 --> 57:12.420
And it was like, it was a horror movie the whole time, dumb-dumbs.

57:12.420 --> 57:13.220
Yeah, exactly.

57:13.220 --> 57:16.740
Just people say it's so scary and you'll be watching the whole thing like,

57:16.740 --> 57:17.460
this doesn't seem that scary.

57:17.460 --> 57:18.980
I don't think it's very scary.

57:18.980 --> 57:22.980
They're out on a lake and then, uh-oh, Jason jumps out of the lake at the end.

57:22.980 --> 57:24.260
Spook, spook, spook.

57:25.220 --> 57:26.180
Smash cut to black.

57:26.180 --> 57:27.460
And there you said it again.

57:27.460 --> 57:28.740
And here's my innovation.

57:28.740 --> 57:30.660
If I might take this innovation even further,

57:30.660 --> 57:33.780
the post-credit sequence is an hour and 45 minutes long.

57:34.740 --> 57:36.580
And it's them fighting the nuthead.

57:36.580 --> 57:37.860
It's them fighting the nuthead.

57:37.860 --> 57:41.140
So it's like, stick around for after the credits,

57:41.140 --> 57:43.220
but do make sure you go to the bathroom during the credits

57:43.220 --> 57:46.020
and get something to eat and maybe call the babysitter.

57:46.020 --> 57:47.300
The movie is about to start.

57:47.300 --> 57:47.540
Yeah.

57:47.540 --> 57:49.940
And I think maybe it doesn't have to be an hour 45 minutes.

57:49.940 --> 57:51.380
I think this is in every movie.

57:51.380 --> 57:56.420
And so while you were sleeping two still woke,

57:57.060 --> 57:58.740
they have to fight off the nuthead

57:58.740 --> 58:00.340
and they probably have a little bit of trouble with it,

58:00.340 --> 58:02.020
but then they push them in front of the train tracks

58:02.020 --> 58:04.900
and it's a very poetic and great way to kill the nuthead.

58:04.900 --> 58:09.380
Thor Ragnarok, they beat the devil or whatever at the end.

58:09.380 --> 58:10.980
I haven't seen it because I don't go to movies anymore,

58:10.980 --> 58:13.380
but they beat them and they're like, yeah, we did it.

58:13.380 --> 58:15.060
And they have the big feast at the end

58:15.060 --> 58:16.580
and Thor's there and the Hulk there

58:16.580 --> 58:17.540
and they're all having fun.

58:17.540 --> 58:19.860
And then nuthead reaches up on a table.

58:19.860 --> 58:21.780
Everything you say to me.

58:21.780 --> 58:23.540
And then it cuts to the end of the credits

58:23.540 --> 58:25.700
and they're like, nuthead smash into the,

58:25.700 --> 58:28.420
they kill him with their superpowers, their big hammer.

58:29.380 --> 58:30.900
So it could be, I mean, it's just,

58:30.900 --> 58:32.340
it doesn't have to be a horror movie.

58:32.340 --> 58:33.940
It's just before the movie ends,

58:33.940 --> 58:35.540
someone has to fight the nuthead.

58:36.420 --> 58:37.700
And that, can I tell you something?

58:38.260 --> 58:39.540
We're going to make bank on that.

58:39.540 --> 58:41.460
Yeah, because you're going to make money from nuthead

58:41.460 --> 58:42.660
being in every movie ever made.

58:42.660 --> 58:43.300
Yeah, right?

58:43.300 --> 58:45.940
Like the, and it's going to create one big,

58:46.740 --> 58:51.860
like nuttiverse where like every movie is connected by nuthead.

58:51.860 --> 58:54.500
And then the way ends when they do the scary movie 80 sequel

58:54.500 --> 58:56.100
and they do have truck nuts at the end of it

58:56.100 --> 58:58.340
and they do all their fun jokes at the end of it.

58:58.340 --> 59:00.420
They're going to have to confront the nuthead

59:00.420 --> 59:02.980
and there's nothing they can, and it's going to confuse.

59:02.980 --> 59:03.940
I thought this was a parody.

59:03.940 --> 59:06.420
Why is the nuthead, he has to be in all movies now.

59:06.420 --> 59:07.300
They passed the law.

59:07.300 --> 59:09.460
It's all, it's illegal.

59:09.460 --> 59:11.540
I have, I have terrible news.

59:12.900 --> 59:14.980
We have put all this in the podcast.

59:14.980 --> 59:15.700
Oh man.

59:15.700 --> 59:16.420
Oh no.

59:16.420 --> 59:17.220
TM, TM, TM.

59:17.220 --> 59:17.860
Yeah, the past-

59:17.860 --> 59:19.060
TM, TM, TM, TM, TM.

59:19.060 --> 59:21.460
Oh, I thought you were saying because the past 25 minutes

59:21.460 --> 59:23.220
have been sort of a freestyle,

59:24.180 --> 59:29.380
just nonsense sort of diarrhea sort of pinata situation.

59:30.180 --> 59:31.140
No, no, no, no, no.

59:31.140 --> 59:32.260
That's, that's all fine.

59:33.380 --> 59:36.580
That is, however, the conclusion of our podcast.

59:36.580 --> 59:40.500
We hope you've inexplicably enjoyed yourself throughout.

59:41.700 --> 59:43.540
Want to, one last time,

59:43.540 --> 59:44.820
because it's the last time I'll get to talk to you

59:44.820 --> 59:48.180
until it happens, McElroy shows.com slash tours.

59:48.180 --> 59:51.940
Please go get tickets for the Chicago show

59:51.940 --> 59:53.540
and our Milwaukee show.

59:53.540 --> 59:54.900
They're going to be a lot of fun.

59:54.900 --> 59:59.300
I promise they will be fun and also somewhat buck wild.

59:59.860 --> 01:00:02.420
And please send in your questions for those shows.

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.460
And when you do, just a little brief reminder

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:09.540
on the best way to get your questions on the shows.

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:12.420
Anything that's like looking for actual help

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:14.900
about a non-serious situation,

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:18.180
like those are the two best scenarios.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.220
Like just a funny story that you saw.

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.420
We appreciate the funny stories.

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:23.460
It's just, please understand,

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:27.700
it is just not a very good launchpad for us to do our thing.

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:30.580
And the same is like, if you are asking about

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.100
like a really serious situation between friends or whatever,

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.260
we're not going to make goofs

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.980
about your very serious life situation.

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:40.020
So when you send in those in,

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:42.340
just make sure to put either Chicago,

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:44.820
Milwaukee or Minneapolis in the subject line

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.220
so I can find them quickly and easily.

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.340
Oh, and same for Yahoo's.

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:52.420
I could really use some help from my Yahoo soldiers out there

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.100
just because we're doing four shows back to back to back

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:54.740
and need a lot of stuff.

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:56.580
Also, I should mention next episode that goes up

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:58.820
will be a live show from one of these things,

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:01.780
but we're going to try not to put up two in a row

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:02.580
like we've done in the past.

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.420
We'll hang on to these and we're going to have

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:06.260
a lot of live shows in the bank.

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:07.460
I'm not sure what we should do with them,

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:08.500
but we'll figure it out.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.260
Also, thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.060
for using our theme song,

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:12.980
It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.100
It's a fantastic album.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:15.380
We're so grateful that we're able to use that

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:15.940
as our theme song.

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.500
And thanks to MaximumFun.org for letting us be on the network.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.980
You can check out all the great shows there at MaximumFun.org.

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:23.140
Shows like Lady to the Lady and Stop Podcasting Yourself

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:24.740
and Jordan and Jesse Go and John Hodgman

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.900
and all kinds of great shows all at MaximumFun.org.

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:29.220
And we have other stuff that you can find at McElroyShows.com.

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:32.900
I also, I want to mention because it's not on MaximumFun

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:35.540
and it's new and I'm really enjoying doing it.

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:38.340
Me and my friend Tybee have started a podcast called Run,

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:39.700
a Doctor Who fan cast.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.140
We're about to wrap up the Eccleston season

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:46.500
and then we're going to jump around to Tennant

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:50.020
and Matt Smith and Capaldi episodes.

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:54.420
So that when the new season premieres with Jodie Whittaker,

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.460
we can talk about that.

01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:59.780
You can find it on iTunes or on Twitter.

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:01.140
It's Run Fan Cast.

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:03.940
But yeah, we're having a really great time doing it

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.460
and I hope you enjoy it.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:07.940
Y'all want to wrap it up?

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:09.780
Yeah, absolutely.

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:10.100
All right.

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.700
This one was sent in by a ton of people.

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:12.420
Thank you, everybody.

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:14.660
It's from Yahoo Answers user Malcolm who asks,

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.220
is every Greg blood related?

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:20.660
I can't find any information.

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.900
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.260
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:27.220
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.980
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.820
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:33.140
Uh oh, what's that coming from under the bed?

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.660
Oh no, he's here.

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:35.860
And then we have to fight the nut head.

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:37.860
Just like it's the end of the thing.

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:39.780
Play with me.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:54.740
You stopped recording, didn't you?

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:10.420
Guess what?

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:10.820
What?

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.500
We just hit our 100th episode.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.220
What?

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:14.820
And what do you think is going to be in store

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.020
for the next 100?

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:18.420
Probably some more feuds with Jennifer Hudson

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.260
and I'm telling you.

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:23.300
We'll probably do more investigative reporting too,

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.020
like we did with the Kodak and their racist film.

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:28.020
Not to mention exposing the truth.

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:30.580
Like how we did with the ugly history of the Texas Rangers.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:34.100
But we always lighten the mood with a splash of pop culture.

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:35.220
Olivia Pope's new wig.

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.180
Have you seen that?

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:36.900
It's popping.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.100
Just like your lip gloss.

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.460
And Janet Jackson.

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.500
And you know we like to put our nerd glasses on

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.900
and talk about things like Marvel.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:45.780
It's true.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:46.260
That's it.

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.860
I don't speak about DC.

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:50.740
But you just did.

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.620
All from a perspective that's black, queer.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:55.060
And ladylike.

01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:57.460
So come on over and learn, laugh, and play

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:58.580
and join the corner.

01:03:58.580 --> 01:03:59.540
It's a lot of fun.

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.500
I'm having fun right now.

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:06.580
Minority Corner.
