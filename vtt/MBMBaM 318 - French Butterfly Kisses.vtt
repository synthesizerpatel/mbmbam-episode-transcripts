00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:46.080
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother My Brother,

00:46.080 --> 00:50.480
the advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:50.480 --> 00:55.120
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.480
Yes. Well, that's our show.

00:58.480 --> 01:02.320
Thanks for listening, everybody. Justin was supposed to start saying stuff, and then he didn't.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.560
Why do I always have to be the one to start saying stuff?

01:04.560 --> 01:09.200
I don't know. Ask the past you from the last 317 weeks or so.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.840
It has not been that consistent. I'm gonna need statistics.

01:12.480 --> 01:17.280
I think it's been at least 308 of 318 times

01:17.280 --> 01:21.360
that you have been the one to introduce whatever our opening bit was.

01:21.360 --> 01:25.600
Travis and I and Griffin have been recording a remote podcast

01:25.600 --> 01:32.080
for 300 and some thousand episodes, and usually we spread across the country

01:32.080 --> 01:35.360
like so much silt across the riverbed.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.360
But today we're recording a remote podcast

01:40.080 --> 01:42.880
when Travis is literally eight minutes from my home.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.880
It is a level of, what do you think?

01:46.880 --> 01:49.600
Disassociation, like, yeah, we just do it.

01:49.600 --> 01:53.600
We just, My Brother My Brother and me, colon, we just can't.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.480
Well, here's the thing, looking at it the other way,

01:56.480 --> 02:00.000
it's actually, it's not about distaste for being in Justin's presence,

02:00.000 --> 02:02.240
but rather a respect for Griffin,

02:02.240 --> 02:05.600
because what I did not want is for Justin and I to be in the same room

02:05.600 --> 02:09.840
making intimate goofs with each other in which we can see each other's faces,

02:09.840 --> 02:12.400
while Griffin was like, what are you guys giggling at?

02:12.400 --> 02:16.480
Fucking tickle fights, fucking butterfly kisses after bedtime prayers.

02:16.480 --> 02:20.800
And I'm over here like trying to replicate butterfly kisses on my own cheek

02:20.800 --> 02:22.400
with like a Swiffer or something.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.480
He's practicing butterfly kisses on his arm

02:24.480 --> 02:26.480
for when he finally gets to do them in real life.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.440
It's not the same.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.920
Try it with a watermelon.

02:30.800 --> 02:31.280
How does it?

02:32.240 --> 02:33.200
It's just more real.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.240
If you try to give a watermelon butterfly kisses.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.280
Especially if you put the watermelon into the microwave for a couple seconds first.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.320
Oh yeah.

02:40.320 --> 02:44.320
Let it cool though or else you'll burn your eyeballs out of your head.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.560
I love this ribald 2000s humor.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.120
See, I do French butterfly kisses

02:49.120 --> 02:53.840
and that's where you get a little bit of eyeball on it.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.120
You just touch corneas.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.680
Just touch the cornea very gently.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.040
It hurts very much.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.080
But Tommy, what about a risk of blindness?

03:04.080 --> 03:05.280
No, that's just a myth, honey.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.880
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

03:06.880 --> 03:07.440
Don't worry.

03:07.440 --> 03:12.160
But Tommy, it's below 32 degrees outside and I, ah, ah, ah, that's it.

03:12.160 --> 03:12.880
Dead.

03:12.880 --> 03:13.840
End of life.

03:13.840 --> 03:20.000
I can't wait for Bob Carlisle to drop the sequel to Bee Kisses.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.840
Butterfly necking.

03:21.840 --> 03:26.000
Well, I just think there's maybe other types of kisses that you can do with your body.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.760
And I think, I mean, we could sit here and try and shoot the shit about what those would be,

03:29.760 --> 03:34.080
but I think Bob Carlisle's probably been at that for about 19 years now.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.520
He hasn't come up with anything yet.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.600
If there's an amazing sequel to that song,

03:39.600 --> 03:44.000
you know he's been digging in that deep water to catch that big fish,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.960
to find that one that got away, that sequel to BK2.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.200
Yeah, here comes the BK2, everybody.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.480
Check out my mixtape.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.680
I'm Bob Carlisle.

03:53.680 --> 03:57.040
I picture Bob Carlisle walking up to Make Out Point or whatever

03:57.040 --> 04:00.800
and just looking in windows and writing down stuff on his legal pad, which is like,

04:00.800 --> 04:01.600
oh, excellent.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.280
Can I rhyme that?

04:03.280 --> 04:03.780
No.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.760
Albatross kisses.

04:05.760 --> 04:06.640
No, no, Bob.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.160
That's someone that, no, listen.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.360
Albatross kisses.

04:09.360 --> 04:10.480
Here's how it works.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.080
Extend your elbows out.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.200
No, Bob, I can't.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.880
Armadillo kisses.

04:14.880 --> 04:18.000
No, no, you roll up in the ball and you give everyone leprosy.

04:18.880 --> 04:22.320
It's really sad if you look at Bob Carlisle's Instagram,

04:22.320 --> 04:24.960
it's just a bunch of pictures of him in front of computers

04:24.960 --> 04:28.720
and in various studios with hashtags like BK2 about to drop,

04:29.280 --> 04:32.640
BK2 coming along real nice, can't wait to hit you all with BK2,

04:33.280 --> 04:38.080
BK2 is in the oven and it's about to pop out real fresh for you, 2016,

04:38.080 --> 04:40.880
but the numbers just get lower and lower as you scroll back to the feed.

04:40.880 --> 04:44.720
It's like 2008, but BK2 is coming.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.240
Y'all get ready.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.120
Launch party.

04:47.120 --> 04:47.840
Check it out.

04:47.840 --> 04:48.320
Check it out.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.760
It got sampled in the latest DJ Khaled track.

04:52.320 --> 04:52.880
You heard me.

04:52.880 --> 04:56.880
We shot it out and he played and it was like Brazilian taper kisses.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.640
Like Brazilian taper kisses.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.120
I don't know.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.760
It's going to be the kind of thing where it's just going to be like overnight,

05:03.760 --> 05:06.320
like it's just going to come out with no pomp and circumstance.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.400
It's just going to drop one day and I was like,

05:08.400 --> 05:10.560
shit, did you know that new BK2 joint dropped?

05:10.560 --> 05:11.440
And I was like, what?

05:12.560 --> 05:14.000
I didn't read about it in the trades.

05:14.960 --> 05:15.520
I didn't know.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.240
I didn't know.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.120
I would have had a party.

05:18.800 --> 05:22.480
Bob's like, no, I'm not putting BK2 on iTunes.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.240
They screwed me one too many times.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.360
BK2 is only on my space.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.200
It's a title exclusive.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.080
Title exclusive.

05:30.800 --> 05:34.240
Did you know Tidal was founded by Carlyle and Jay-Z

05:34.240 --> 05:36.560
to get working together for like the eighth time?

05:36.560 --> 05:37.920
Is this Bob Carlyle?

05:37.920 --> 05:38.480
Yeah, it is.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.960
So are you going to join Tidal?

05:40.960 --> 05:41.920
Here's the one thing.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.240
The only thing that I need from you is...

05:44.240 --> 05:45.200
No, I can't do it.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.120
No, we need BK2 to be a title exclusive.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.320
It's not ready, Jay-Z.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.520
I told you it's not ready.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.640
The world's not ready for BK2.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.680
Well, call me this, Bob, after I mix BK1 for you.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.040
I know, Jay-Z.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.560
Tell me the animal, Carlyle.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.840
I'm dying over here.

05:59.840 --> 06:00.720
Capybara.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.040
Don't you fucking tell.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.000
Don't you tell a soul.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.280
Get it again, Carlyle.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.200
You crazy for this one?

06:07.200 --> 06:07.700
Hov!

06:08.320 --> 06:08.800
No, that's...

06:09.440 --> 06:11.680
Oh, if that was all it was, Jay-Z,

06:11.680 --> 06:15.680
I've known Capybara for 13 years now.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.440
He's been haunting me in my dreams.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.760
I've known it's him, but I just can't catch it.

06:19.760 --> 06:20.960
I have dreams sometimes

06:20.960 --> 06:23.520
when I'm standing naked in front of the blazing sun

06:23.520 --> 06:25.280
and there's a volcano behind me

06:25.280 --> 06:27.360
and I can feel its ash pelting down

06:27.360 --> 06:29.040
on the back of the nape of my neck.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.360
And right in front of me is the Capybara,

06:31.360 --> 06:34.160
ever elusive, darting in and out between palm trees

06:34.160 --> 06:35.520
and my kindergarten teacher.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.720
What does it even look like?

06:36.720 --> 06:37.600
I don't know.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.680
What she's there, I can't, I try to focus on it

06:39.680 --> 06:41.680
as like it fades into the mists.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.200
You just gotta Google it, Bob.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.480
Oh, oh wait, hold on.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.200
Yeah.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.320
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.520
Okay, okay.

06:47.520 --> 06:48.400
How would that kiss?

06:48.400 --> 06:49.120
I don't know.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.480
Listen, you're the magician here, Bob.

06:50.480 --> 06:51.680
I'm just Jay-Z.

06:51.680 --> 06:52.880
You're Bob Carlyle.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.960
You're the musical genius here, not me.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.720
I'm just trying to, I know the animal,

06:58.720 --> 07:00.080
I just don't know how to kiss like it.

07:00.080 --> 07:03.280
And according to Wikipedia, the word Capybara

07:03.280 --> 07:05.360
is derived from a Tupi word,

07:05.360 --> 07:08.320
which means one who will eat slender leaves.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.240
And I'm wondering if I can sort of incorporate that

07:10.240 --> 07:12.320
into the kiss, like maybe you put some grass in your mouth

07:12.320 --> 07:13.840
and then you kiss your daughter goodnight.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.240
Fuck, no.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.960
Tragic news today is Bob Carlyle has been killed

07:18.960 --> 07:20.480
in a terrible zoo accident.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.600
He leapt into a Capybara enclosure.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.720
Onlookers say he was attempting to Capybara kiss.

07:27.520 --> 07:28.640
Tragedy strikes tonight.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.240
Bob Carlyle has choked to death

07:30.240 --> 07:31.840
trying to eat his daughter's hair.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.000
He said that's the only thing he could come up with

07:34.000 --> 07:34.880
that was like that.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.200
And then he died from it.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.600
So it's very sad, but we hope we're good.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.320
I'm Geraldo Rivera, and I'm here getting ready

07:42.320 --> 07:45.280
to smash open Bob Carlyle's vault to see.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.600
We're pretty sure the demo for BK2 is in here.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.120
I'm joined by special guest Jay-Z

07:51.680 --> 07:54.560
and we're about to just smash open Bob Carlyle's vault.

07:54.560 --> 07:55.920
Bob would want this.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.840
Oh my God, oh my God.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.120
Bob Carlyle is alive and inside the vault.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.040
Prestige.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.280
David Blaine, I didn't even know

08:05.280 --> 08:06.640
you were friends with Bob Carlyle.

08:07.760 --> 08:08.960
Hey, let's do some advice.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.600
Bob, if you want to come on the show at any time.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.280
Yeah, you'd be a welcome guest.

08:15.280 --> 08:18.080
If you want to use this as a vehicle debut BK2,

08:18.080 --> 08:20.480
we are fucking so ready for it, dog.

08:20.480 --> 08:21.760
Yeah, we'll drop it right on here.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.680
Once or twice a week, I go to a small corner store

08:25.680 --> 08:27.920
and get an egg and cheese sandwich for lunch.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.680
Usually there are two guys working there.

08:29.680 --> 08:30.960
One man in the cash register

08:30.960 --> 08:32.720
and the other in the kitchen or sitting around.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.640
I've been doing this for almost a year.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.920
So kitchen guy knows my order and will ask if I want

08:37.920 --> 08:40.320
the usual when I go in around lunchtime.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.560
One time kitchen guy wasn't there.

08:42.560 --> 08:44.720
So I had to get my sandwich from cash register guy.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.880
The only thing is he made a noticeably better sandwich

08:48.880 --> 08:49.840
than normal.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.680
It was crispier, lighter,

08:51.680 --> 08:56.960
and a perfectly proportioned ingredients.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.480
But that was only for one day.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.280
My regular guy is back.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.480
And so are the substandard sandwiches.

09:04.480 --> 09:09.360
So anything, anyway, let cashier man know it's true calling

09:09.360 --> 09:11.840
or should I suck it up and avoid rocking the boat?

09:14.640 --> 09:16.160
Thanks pick in Pennsylvania.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.080
The only like the only way this could get better

09:20.080 --> 09:22.480
is if one day cash register guy wasn't there.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.640
And so kitchen guy made him a sandwich was like,

09:24.640 --> 09:27.600
all right, that'll be 356 out of five years change.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.840
How did you do that that fast?

09:29.840 --> 09:31.200
Your fingers were poor.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.600
You got me my change so fast.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.640
That was crazy.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.600
You hand me my change in Mayan nickels.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.720
How did you do this?

09:38.720 --> 09:39.920
How did you pull this off?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.240
This is the blooms.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.000
You threw the change up in the air

09:44.000 --> 09:46.160
and the bills landed perfectly in my wallet

09:46.160 --> 09:48.640
and the coins landed perfectly in my pocket.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.480
You you've got a gift.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.200
Don't you do this to me sandwich guy?

09:55.200 --> 09:57.280
No, you've got a gift cashier guy.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.840
Okay, so there's cat.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.560
There's two.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.760
There's two guys there.

10:01.760 --> 10:02.400
There's cash.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.240
I'm gonna just call him cash.

10:04.960 --> 10:09.280
And then Andy cash and what's the name for the kitchen guy?

10:09.280 --> 10:10.400
Okay, tango.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.760
Okay, so tango.

10:11.760 --> 10:16.080
The kitchen guy is not making the sandwiches

10:16.080 --> 10:19.920
how you would ideally like them cash guys better.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.800
Do you think see this is the problem with promoting up?

10:22.800 --> 10:24.400
And I've said this so many times.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.920
I bet you he got so good at the kitchen

10:27.920 --> 10:30.400
and the boss was so impressed that he got promoted

10:30.400 --> 10:31.920
to the person manning the cash register.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.360
But this is the problem, right?

10:33.360 --> 10:35.280
You promote up and then you don't have the best people

10:35.280 --> 10:36.320
doing the best jobs.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.280
This is business 101.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.800
Okay, that wasn't a goof.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.880
You're just somewhere in there.

10:42.880 --> 10:43.520
Ayn Rand.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.320
No, I'm just saying that I think that that's probably

10:46.320 --> 10:48.960
what happened here is like, I don't think it's that.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.600
I'm not sure that they missed their calling.

10:51.600 --> 10:55.120
I'm saying that they like maybe got promoted out

10:55.120 --> 10:56.880
of the guy making the sandwiches

10:56.880 --> 10:58.720
even though he's like still got it.

10:58.720 --> 11:03.200
So I still got the heat and I bet he hates me at a desk jockey.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.640
Every morning he comes in, he opens up the shop every morning

11:06.640 --> 11:09.840
and he just like runs his hands over like the kitchen counters

11:09.840 --> 11:11.200
and he's just like, hello old friend.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.720
And he touches the egg and cheese sandwich fixings.

11:15.280 --> 11:19.680
Cash register guy, why do they have you working a desk

11:19.680 --> 11:22.800
and not getting out there and cooking those good sandwiches?

11:22.800 --> 11:24.080
I shot a kid.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.040
Cash register guy.

11:28.960 --> 11:32.720
I don't even know why you would do that

11:32.720 --> 11:34.880
while cooking breakfast sandwiches,

11:34.880 --> 11:37.760
but I also don't know why you wouldn't go to prison.

11:37.760 --> 11:41.120
My sandwiches are too good.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.320
And then at the end of the movie,

11:43.280 --> 11:45.360
he, John McCain's about to get shot

11:45.360 --> 11:47.040
and he makes a really good breakfast sandwich.

11:47.680 --> 11:48.640
He's like, you did it.

11:50.640 --> 11:54.640
Um, uh, I mean, there's nothing you can do about this, right?

11:54.640 --> 11:56.160
Like, you know, now I think you've,

11:56.720 --> 11:59.040
you can't say you two should switch jobs

11:59.040 --> 12:00.560
cause that's crazy.

12:00.560 --> 12:00.880
Can't.

12:00.880 --> 12:04.160
Um, you know now that the sandwiches

12:04.160 --> 12:07.440
that you ate for over a year were not good.

12:07.440 --> 12:08.000
Right?

12:08.000 --> 12:08.640
Maybe they're okay.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.040
That makes them worse by comparison too though, right?

12:11.040 --> 12:12.960
Yeah, so I don't think you can go back here

12:12.960 --> 12:14.400
knowing what you know.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.160
Let me, I would like to pitch something.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.040
Something we don't normally endorse here

12:19.040 --> 12:20.400
on my brother, my brother and me.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.800
But you know, it's, it's 2016.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.280
I'm saying maybe you go bold and brassy.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.440
You walk in tomorrow, you order a sandwich

12:29.440 --> 12:31.760
and you say, but I want it made by him.

12:31.760 --> 12:33.280
And you point at cash register guy

12:33.280 --> 12:34.400
and kitchen guy's like, what?

12:34.400 --> 12:35.840
And cash register guy's like, what?

12:35.840 --> 12:38.400
And you just say, he made a sandwich for me once

12:38.400 --> 12:39.920
and it was the best version I've ever tasted.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.040
I want him to make it.

12:41.040 --> 12:42.560
Kitchen guy, I want you to watch

12:42.560 --> 12:44.800
and I want you to do exactly that, like that from now on

12:44.800 --> 12:46.320
because I'm a paying customer.

12:46.320 --> 12:46.800
This is America.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.000
Cause I'm a huge asshole.

12:48.000 --> 12:48.320
I'm the biggest asshole ever.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.360
You're not my friends.

12:49.360 --> 12:50.880
These people aren't your friends, Griffin.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.800
You're paying for goods and services.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.640
You should get the best sandwich available.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.640
You should not take a second class sandwich

12:56.640 --> 12:58.720
because you're afraid to ask for what you want.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.080
Travis is, um, Travis is giving great advice,

13:02.080 --> 13:04.320
especially if you want to spend the next year

13:04.320 --> 13:08.000
enjoying a breakfast sandwich of eggs and cheese and spit

13:08.000 --> 13:09.360
because that's what you're getting.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.560
You're that asshole.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.560
I'm not saying it's not a risky maneuver.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.080
It is definitely a risky maneuver.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.120
And if it works, great.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.440
If it doesn't, no more sandwiches for you.

13:17.440 --> 13:20.080
Not only at this restaurant, but perhaps anywhere.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.480
Oh, make no mistake.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.080
This breaks two ways.

13:24.080 --> 13:24.640
Yeah.

13:24.640 --> 13:26.800
One, it's all fixed.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.000
This will not happen.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.240
Two, you never go to this place again.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.080
You might even have to move

13:32.080 --> 13:34.720
if there's some kind of intricate sandwich network

13:34.720 --> 13:37.840
in this city where word spreads about that demanding guy

13:37.840 --> 13:39.920
who wanted cash for this guy to make the sandwich.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.640
But otherwise, you're stuck eating sandwiches

13:42.640 --> 13:45.760
for the rest of your life that you know are subpar.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.200
And now you've tasted ambrosia

13:49.200 --> 13:52.800
and you can't go back to your regular humdrum lifestyle.

13:52.800 --> 13:56.160
If I know anything from like your Alice in Wonderland's

13:56.160 --> 13:58.560
through the Looking Glass kind of books,

13:58.560 --> 14:00.800
you can't go back to your humdrum lifestyle.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.960
You're going to dream of that fantasy sandwich.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.520
Yeah, yeah.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.680
I mean, you could buy the place.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.280
Yeah, now we're talking.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.160
Now we're talking.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.760
You can kickstart it.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.200
Kickstart to buy the place.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.720
I need this, please, Indiegogo.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.960
I actually think, okay, okay.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.800
I think you could ease into it.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.920
You guys are familiar with,

14:21.280 --> 14:23.040
I first heard Al Franken referred to it

14:23.040 --> 14:24.400
as kitting on the square.

14:24.400 --> 14:24.880
Yes.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.360
So you could kid on the square and say, listen,

14:28.560 --> 14:29.840
hey, I just want to let you know

14:29.840 --> 14:31.360
you better watch out for your job

14:31.360 --> 14:33.440
because this guy over here,

14:33.440 --> 14:35.040
when he made my sandwich,

14:35.040 --> 14:36.720
it was the best it's ever been.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.120
I love your work, but he was killing it.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.760
And then it's like, very good one, very good joke.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.800
And it's like, you know what?

14:43.440 --> 14:44.640
Let's keep this joke going.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.440
Why don't you come over here

14:45.440 --> 14:46.880
and show him exactly what you did.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.120
You know what would be fucking like super funny?

14:50.240 --> 14:51.680
What if you just left?

14:52.400 --> 14:54.400
What if you left right now?

14:54.400 --> 14:56.080
What if you gave up cooking forever?

14:56.080 --> 14:58.960
I'm saying you could do,

14:58.960 --> 15:00.880
you could kid your way into it.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.240
When you like, you know what?

15:02.240 --> 15:03.440
Just relax, just watch him

15:03.440 --> 15:04.800
and tell him what you do differently.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.920
Cause I want to know what your secret is.

15:05.920 --> 15:06.880
Cause that guy's is great.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.720
So you're backing into it with a compliment.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.360
What you do is you'll get that guy on your side.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.320
That's a secret.

15:12.320 --> 15:15.280
You got to convert that guy to like being on your team

15:15.280 --> 15:18.160
and it will turn kitchen guy against you.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.840
But you can convert this with laughter.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.000
You can just make it into a big funny joke

15:22.000 --> 15:22.960
where at the end of the joke,

15:22.960 --> 15:25.200
the punchline is what a sandwich.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.800
You could also just make it up straight up comment

15:26.800 --> 15:28.320
and say, I would like two sandwiches

15:28.320 --> 15:30.400
and I'd like you all to compete for my favor.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.240
May the odds be ever.

15:32.240 --> 15:33.440
It's the hungry games.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.720
I mean, that's actually a good idea Travis.

15:36.720 --> 15:37.920
I mean, I definitely wouldn't phrase it

15:37.920 --> 15:38.720
the way you phrased it,

15:38.720 --> 15:39.520
but I'd say like,

15:39.520 --> 15:41.840
I need two sandwiches prepared simultaneously

15:41.840 --> 15:43.520
and served up to me in the exact same time.

15:44.240 --> 15:46.160
I have a very, very particular fetish

15:46.160 --> 15:47.280
and a particular set of skills

15:47.280 --> 15:48.720
that make me a nightmare for men like you.

15:50.800 --> 15:51.680
Those skills are,

15:51.680 --> 15:53.520
I am just a really shitty customer.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.880
I'm a bad, yeah, I'm not a great human either.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.760
How about a Yahoo?

15:58.320 --> 15:59.040
Please.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.240
I just wanna tell y'all,

16:00.240 --> 16:03.840
this is like a fun little update on my life

16:03.840 --> 16:06.400
is I have the Wikipedia page open for capybara here

16:06.400 --> 16:07.920
to sort of look into their physiology

16:07.920 --> 16:08.720
and how they might kiss.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.960
And Wikipedia has a conservation status

16:12.960 --> 16:14.560
for like animal species

16:15.200 --> 16:17.680
to let you know like how they do in vis-a-vis extinction.

16:18.880 --> 16:22.560
Capybara, lowest rating,

16:22.560 --> 16:25.600
least concern is the rating on this conservation status.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.280
Keep it up, capybara,

16:27.280 --> 16:28.480
like you're my favorite animal

16:28.480 --> 16:30.080
and you're doing so good out there.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.520
Keep doing what you're doing

16:31.520 --> 16:32.720
because it's great.

16:32.720 --> 16:33.360
By which I mean,

16:33.360 --> 16:35.680
we don't hunt you for sport or food.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.200
So this rating is saying like,

16:37.200 --> 16:37.840
if someone's like,

16:37.840 --> 16:39.200
you know, I'm just worried about capybara,

16:39.200 --> 16:40.080
it's like, don't.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.600
No, dog, don't even worry about it.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.000
The other thing it could be saying is like,

16:44.000 --> 16:45.200
if you gotta kill something.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.920
Hey, do you wanna feel alive?

16:47.920 --> 16:48.800
Sure, we all do.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.120
That would be a fuck joke.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.400
If you're a capybara and you see it,

16:52.400 --> 16:54.560
you're like, so least concern,

16:54.560 --> 16:57.440
so it's fine if I just like die.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.200
You just write it in marker,

16:59.200 --> 17:01.440
like Derek, highest concern,

17:01.440 --> 17:02.640
Derek the capybara,

17:02.640 --> 17:03.440
please do not hunt.

17:04.640 --> 17:05.840
I can't even joke about this.

17:06.720 --> 17:10.880
How about this Yahoo that was sent in by Zoe Kinski,

17:10.880 --> 17:11.440
riding high.

17:11.440 --> 17:11.920
Thank you, Zoe.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.040
It's by Yahoo answers users.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.240
Something has gone wrong

17:14.240 --> 17:15.600
because our website sucks.

17:17.360 --> 17:21.600
But there's an antacid banner advertisement

17:21.600 --> 17:23.920
at the top of the page featuring Larry the Cable Guy.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.080
So let's just say Larry the Cable Guy asks,

17:27.440 --> 17:29.760
how do I teach my dog discipline

17:29.760 --> 17:31.040
through the martial arts?

17:33.040 --> 17:34.400
I have a problem with my dog.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.760
He poops all over the house,

17:35.760 --> 17:36.880
chews on my footwear,

17:36.880 --> 17:38.560
constantly knocks over the trash cans,

17:38.560 --> 17:40.400
makes a mess in the house every time I leave.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.080
Just an overall lack of discipline

17:42.080 --> 17:43.200
and structure in his life.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.680
He's also a bit of a pushover with other dogs,

17:45.680 --> 17:47.840
gets constantly intimidated and pushed around.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.080
His bark leaves much to be desired as well.

17:50.080 --> 17:53.360
Almost seems as if he is saying sorry every time he barks.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.440
He definitely needs the discipline

17:55.440 --> 17:56.800
that only martial arts can teach.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.400
Obviously grappling arts out of the question

17:58.400 --> 18:00.080
since he lacks opposable thumbs.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.840
But what other options are there for him?

18:02.560 --> 18:04.640
How do I teach him how to roundhouse kick other dogs

18:04.640 --> 18:06.240
every time they get in his face?

18:06.240 --> 18:08.160
Is there any way to teach him to channel his chi

18:08.160 --> 18:09.760
in order to produce a more menacing bark?

18:09.760 --> 18:11.920
I heard Kung Fu teaches several animal forms.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.360
Is there a dog form in there?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.800
What about karate?

18:14.800 --> 18:16.480
Are there any empty handed techniques

18:16.480 --> 18:17.760
made especially for dogs?

18:17.760 --> 18:20.080
I simply want my dog to be a dog amongst dogs,

18:20.080 --> 18:22.160
a menacing terror, alpha all the way,

18:22.160 --> 18:23.920
and to stop pooping all over the house.

18:26.240 --> 18:28.240
One, I think there's a huge missed opportunity

18:28.240 --> 18:32.160
to just immediately rule out any of the grappling arts

18:32.160 --> 18:36.080
because what's the last thing a dog's opponent would expect?

18:36.080 --> 18:37.200
Yeah, that's a good point.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.000
Right?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.760
Is to use their weight against him.

18:39.760 --> 18:40.720
Get him real low to the ground

18:40.720 --> 18:42.160
and throw him with a jujitsu throw.

18:42.160 --> 18:47.680
Can you read the bit about animal forms again?

18:47.680 --> 18:49.840
I heard Kung Fu teaches several animal forms.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.600
Is there a dog form in there?

18:51.600 --> 18:52.640
Okay, so that-

18:52.640 --> 18:54.320
That's a misnomer.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.040
There's a misunderstanding that has occurred here.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.080
That is not what that means.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.200
Although I will say this.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.160
First of all, Kung Fu Panda.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.160
Second of all, in Kung Fu Panda,

19:04.160 --> 19:05.680
like the snake uses snake style.

19:05.680 --> 19:06.640
And that's my second of all,

19:06.640 --> 19:08.720
is that I think if a snake is gonna learn Kung Fu,

19:08.720 --> 19:10.160
I think snake style would be like,

19:10.160 --> 19:11.680
oh, that's my jab, what's your jab?

19:11.680 --> 19:14.080
Yeah, I don't think there's like an immediate correlation,

19:14.080 --> 19:17.920
but if a dog was going to learn one form, dog form-

19:17.920 --> 19:18.880
Dog form would be it.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.720
Doggy style makes the most sense.

19:20.720 --> 19:21.840
Yeah, so-

19:21.840 --> 19:23.280
You gotta teach them doggy style.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.280
Doggy style's a very funny joke.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.160
Thank you.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.920
I just, I didn't want that to be the thing

19:27.920 --> 19:29.680
that people tweeted at us after the episode.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.160
No, yeah, yeah.

19:30.160 --> 19:31.920
How did you not say doggy style?

19:31.920 --> 19:32.400
Yeah, sure.

19:32.400 --> 19:32.880
Yeah.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.160
Yeah, I hate when people do that.

19:34.160 --> 19:35.680
We need a segment at the end of each bit

19:35.680 --> 19:36.960
called low hanging fruit.

19:36.960 --> 19:37.280
Yeah.

19:37.280 --> 19:40.080
Just like, here's the things that we know we could have said

19:40.080 --> 19:42.640
but we just like left on the scrap pile.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.720
So you don't have to go rummaging through our garbage.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.880
I've actually just been building my whole comedy style

19:46.880 --> 19:47.920
based off of that since like day one.

19:47.920 --> 19:48.880
It's worked so far.

19:48.880 --> 19:49.520
Yeah, yeah.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.840
Here's what I'll say.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.160
This is one thing that if we don't say it,

19:56.160 --> 19:57.200
people are gonna tweet at us.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.720
You should never, with no exceptions,

20:00.720 --> 20:04.080
you should never do Kung Fu on a dog with one exception.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.560
So let me get this straight, with no exceptions,

20:08.560 --> 20:10.240
you should never do Kung Fu on a dog.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.720
100% of the time, you should never do Kung Fu on a dog.

20:12.720 --> 20:13.760
But there's only one time,

20:13.760 --> 20:15.360
there's only one instance in which

20:16.400 --> 20:19.120
it is acceptable and or encouraged

20:19.120 --> 20:21.440
and that is if you are teaching that Kung Fu to the dog.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.080
Well, we're missing an obvious answer here.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.120
Okay, I was a dog trainer and I could tell you

20:27.120 --> 20:29.440
the easiest way for any dog to learn

20:30.240 --> 20:32.720
is to observe other dogs doing it.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.560
So what you actually need in this situation

20:34.560 --> 20:36.080
is like a Mr. Miyagi dog.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.560
You need an older dog who's out of the game,

20:38.560 --> 20:41.600
who's like, no, I don't do Kung Fu anymore.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.480
I don't do that anymore.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.720
And then he sees your dog getting picked on

20:44.720 --> 20:46.640
by the other dogs at the dog park

20:46.640 --> 20:49.040
and finally Mr. Miyagi dog is like,

20:49.040 --> 20:50.080
all right, come on, dog.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.120
I'll show you how to catch flies with chopsticks

20:53.120 --> 20:57.120
and trim bonsai trees and wax on and wax off

20:57.120 --> 20:58.400
and then you don't have to do shit

20:58.400 --> 21:00.240
but then you do have to worry about your dog

21:00.240 --> 21:01.600
getting super good at Kung Fu

21:01.600 --> 21:06.400
and just beating you up whenever it wants food and shit.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.640
I just googled Karate Dog.

21:16.640 --> 21:22.400
There was a 2004 movie called The Karate Dog.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.480
Tell me more.

21:26.480 --> 21:29.680
It's got Simon Rex, Jamie Presley were in it.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.160
It's also got Pat Morita makes an appearance.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.760
Let me just keep reading.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.800
It looks like John Voight was in the motion picture

21:38.800 --> 21:41.040
and who was the voice of Cho-Cho,

21:41.040 --> 21:44.720
the titular Karate Dog who in the fucking cover art

21:44.720 --> 21:46.960
is also holding a police badge.

21:48.160 --> 21:50.960
Excuse me, Karate Police Dog.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.960
It looks to me like, yes, let me double.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.400
Yes, it was Chevy Chase.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.240
Of course it was.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.880
No, man, we make fun of it.

21:58.880 --> 22:03.040
Chevy Chase gives a hard time for being kind of a dill weed

22:03.040 --> 22:05.040
to some people it sounds like to me

22:05.040 --> 22:08.480
but it sounds like maybe he's had kind of a hard road.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.320
We should probably try to get him a little slack.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.840
This box art is he lays in bed at night

22:13.840 --> 22:15.680
just thinking about Karate Dog and weeping.

22:16.560 --> 22:20.080
Y'all, this box art for The Karate Dog

22:20.080 --> 22:26.080
is the most buck wild JPEG I've ever streamed onto my Laffy.

22:26.080 --> 22:31.040
I'm talking about like a bullmastiff

22:31.040 --> 22:34.240
with a fucking necktie and an eye patch.

22:34.240 --> 22:37.680
I'm talking about the Karate Dog is taking up

22:37.680 --> 22:41.040
two thirds of the cover and he's got a little sash on

22:41.040 --> 22:43.120
and also a police badge.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.760
And then there's one weird corner dog

22:45.760 --> 22:49.520
who you can only see like a third of its horrified face

22:49.520 --> 22:51.360
as it peeks into the corner as if to say,

22:51.360 --> 22:52.800
what's happening in this movie?

22:52.800 --> 22:53.760
John Voight, no!

22:55.840 --> 22:58.320
People who are also fans of the Flophouse

22:58.320 --> 23:00.000
will appreciate that when you click on the poster

23:00.000 --> 23:03.040
for Karate Dog image related images with that.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.120
Oh, a talking cat.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.720
The talking cat?

23:06.720 --> 23:08.880
The spiritual cousin to Karate Dog.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.000
Okay, so there's another poster for Karate Dog

23:12.800 --> 23:16.640
that one, does not mention Chevy Chase.

23:16.640 --> 23:20.640
Two, as near as I can tell, it looks like Karate Dog.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.240
Okay, this is essential.

23:22.240 --> 23:22.740
Oh, wow.

23:23.440 --> 23:27.040
It is still wearing the badge around its neck.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.120
And I, is that a black belt?

23:29.120 --> 23:31.040
Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.520
They're not gonna make a movie about a dog that does karate

23:33.520 --> 23:36.320
if it's just starting out learning the martial arts.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.800
This is the Karate Dog, he's a yellow belt.

23:40.800 --> 23:41.280
Oh.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.000
Really?

23:42.000 --> 23:42.500
All right.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.520
Other note about the trailer.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.680
Hi, this is, hey, this is Jon Voight.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.000
Yeah, is this my agent?

23:50.000 --> 23:50.960
Yes, it is.

23:50.960 --> 23:55.440
Listen, I was looking at the cover art for Karate Dog.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.800
Am I really credited below Simon Rex?

23:58.800 --> 24:03.040
Does Simon Rex really get billing above me, Jon Voight?

24:03.040 --> 24:04.400
Yeah, that's the way it should go.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.600
Sorry, we didn't have a lot of room.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.600
What with all the badges and crazy dogs.

24:08.160 --> 24:12.000
Is this, seeing as how it's called the Karate Dog,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.480
is it a spiritual successor to the Karate Kid?

24:14.480 --> 24:17.520
Does it go like the Karate Kid, one, two, three,

24:17.520 --> 24:18.880
Karate Kid with-

24:20.800 --> 24:21.520
Hilary Swank?

24:21.520 --> 24:23.200
Hilary Swank, and then the Karate Dog.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.040
Like, is this all in the same canon?

24:25.040 --> 24:26.800
Is this Karate Kid canon?

24:26.800 --> 24:27.360
Pat Morita.

24:27.360 --> 24:30.080
Pat Morita's appearance would intimate as much.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.840
Yeah, so is this canonical?

24:33.280 --> 24:36.480
I don't know if this is part of the quadrilogy

24:36.480 --> 24:38.640
of Karate Kid films now.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.800
It is now, as far as I'm concerned.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.600
Okay, this is gonna be a power hipster move.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.280
If your friends are like, I like the Karate Kid.

24:45.280 --> 24:45.840
Like, oh, do you?

24:45.840 --> 24:46.640
Have you seen them all?

24:46.640 --> 24:48.480
And they're like, yeah, I'm like, even Karate Dog?

24:48.480 --> 24:49.360
And they're like, what?

24:49.360 --> 24:51.440
And you're like, yeah, I didn't think so.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.760
And then you cut them out of the forums or whatever.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.120
Hey, great news for everybody.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.400
Cancel your evening plans.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.320
You can stream the entirety of Karate Dog

24:58.320 --> 24:59.600
for free on YouTube.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.000
Oh my God.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.040
You can just watch the whole thing.

25:01.840 --> 25:02.480
Later.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.080
Can we show the dog Karate Dog

25:04.080 --> 25:06.240
to teach it to stop being such a piece of shit?

25:07.680 --> 25:08.960
Be more like this dog.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.040
Sound more like Chevy.

25:11.600 --> 25:12.480
Chevy Shays.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.760
Be more like Chevy Shays.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.760
Do you think Chevy Chase ever lies down

25:17.760 --> 25:22.000
on his armless sofa and he calls it his Chevy Chase Lounge?

25:22.880 --> 25:23.920
He probably does, right?

25:23.920 --> 25:26.240
Hey, how about another question though?

25:26.240 --> 25:31.120
Nine Lives made $17.1 million at the box office

25:31.120 --> 25:35.440
and received a 7% positive rating from Rotten Tomatoes.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.160
Speaking of trash, we have another segment

25:38.160 --> 25:40.400
that we cooked up last week

25:40.400 --> 25:45.760
where people who are in the trash and garbage industry

25:45.760 --> 25:48.640
are gonna tell us the stories of the oddest things

25:48.640 --> 25:51.600
they've ever collected in their day-to-day lives.

25:51.600 --> 25:51.840
Yeah.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.960
And Travis, you said you received some of these

25:54.960 --> 25:58.560
in a new segment we're calling Trash Stories.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.520
Yeah, we got a bunch of them.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.600
Griffin was gonna sing the jingle for Trash Stories.

26:03.600 --> 26:11.040
A trash story is a new kind of way to love.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.600
We received a lot of trash stories this week.

26:14.800 --> 26:18.960
Some of them so gross to trump any humor

26:18.960 --> 26:20.320
that was present in them.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.120
Oops, oh no.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.680
Well, we used to get almost like 90% of our emails

26:25.680 --> 26:27.280
were dookie questions.

26:27.280 --> 26:30.080
So I feel like people needed a place to put that energy

26:30.080 --> 26:31.520
and I'm worried that it's gonna funnel

26:31.520 --> 26:33.600
into Trash Stories Mountain.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.640
You're not wrong, but there were a couple

26:36.640 --> 26:39.760
that contained no overt grossness.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.440
This one is from Cassandra in Tennessee.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.920
My stepdad is a garbage man and over the last few years

26:45.920 --> 26:48.480
he has scored enough fully functional camping gear

26:48.480 --> 26:52.000
for my family of five, me, husband, and three kids

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
to take a three-week long camping trip

26:54.000 --> 26:55.680
without purchasing a thing.

26:55.680 --> 26:59.680
We had sleeping bags, cots, two coolers, a huge tent,

26:59.680 --> 27:03.520
flashlights, backpacks, hiking boots, and much more.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.760
All courtesy of other people's trash.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.440
Pictures of the trip attached.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.400
That's so amazing.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.160
That's two things.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.520
First of all, you're welcome.

27:14.320 --> 27:16.560
Because I think most of that probably came from me

27:16.560 --> 27:20.080
because I have gone camping once in the last six years

27:20.080 --> 27:22.800
and I got very bad diarrhea in the woods.

27:22.800 --> 27:23.760
And guess what?

27:23.760 --> 27:25.200
When you have diarrhea, the woods,

27:25.200 --> 27:26.720
there is no comfort for you there.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.120
You will find no solace.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.440
And so I said, okay, goodbye sleeping bags,

27:31.440 --> 27:33.920
goodbye cots, goodbye two coolers, goodbye huge tent,

27:33.920 --> 27:35.920
flashlights, backpacks, hiking boots, and much more.

27:37.120 --> 27:40.000
And it sounds like your stepdad sort of had a bonanza

27:40.000 --> 27:41.600
in my can.

27:41.600 --> 27:50.400
I have to say, the second thing is that this,

27:50.400 --> 27:53.360
I'm totally into a dude like free cycling

27:54.320 --> 27:56.560
or whatever it's called, freeganism.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.440
I'm like a totally, I'm super down with it, reduce, reuse.

27:59.440 --> 28:00.000
Loving it.

28:00.560 --> 28:03.360
A tent, at that point-

28:03.360 --> 28:04.480
A tent is where you had a problem?

28:04.480 --> 28:05.920
Cause mine was hiking boots.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.320
I mean, you can delouse those, whatever,

28:08.320 --> 28:12.640
but like a tent is you're sleeping in trash.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.480
It is a house made of trash.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.080
Man, that's a nice tent though.

28:18.800 --> 28:19.680
Is it a nice tent?

28:19.680 --> 28:21.120
I'll forward you guys the image.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.480
I mean, you don't need to forward it to me.

28:22.480 --> 28:25.440
It's mine and it was.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.640
I have two big questions.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.280
One is not a question, just an observation.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.920
I really liked the image of everybody

28:31.920 --> 28:34.000
who has thrown this stuff out who went camping

28:34.000 --> 28:35.920
was just like, never again.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.240
I'm never doing this again.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.640
I'm leaving all this in the garbage.

28:40.640 --> 28:41.680
I'm never going again.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.360
Like you didn't even want to store it somewhere.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.720
You're just like that certain

28:44.720 --> 28:46.080
that you would never go camping again.

28:46.960 --> 28:47.680
Yes, I was.

28:48.480 --> 28:51.600
The tent, there's two options here

28:52.160 --> 28:53.920
that I find very puzzling.

28:53.920 --> 28:57.040
The first is that the tent was left

28:57.040 --> 28:59.600
in the garbage fully assembled.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.120
That seems unlikely to me.

29:01.120 --> 29:03.280
I don't even know how you would transport that.

29:03.280 --> 29:05.200
The second is that your stepfather

29:05.920 --> 29:07.600
knows how to put together a tent

29:07.600 --> 29:10.400
without any instructions or pieces or anything.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.640
That will be, I cannot fathom that.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.640
Tents are the hardest things to make

29:14.640 --> 29:16.560
and that he was able to put that together

29:16.560 --> 29:17.600
without any sort of instruction.

29:17.600 --> 29:18.640
I think that's fascinating.

29:18.640 --> 29:21.440
Well, I can believe that Justin

29:21.440 --> 29:22.800
because I think that the stepfather

29:22.800 --> 29:26.160
had the forethought to collect this stuff

29:26.160 --> 29:28.800
over many years, according to this email,

29:28.800 --> 29:30.960
thinking one day I will be able to gift

29:30.960 --> 29:34.880
my stepdaughter an entire set of camping stuff.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.640
I think that's amazing.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.080
We have another one as well.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.880
This one is from the woman formerly known as Trash Lady.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.240
I worked for a trash company

29:44.240 --> 29:46.240
in the sales department until recently.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.680
The weirdest call I've gotten

29:47.680 --> 29:51.200
was from a man who had an abundance of cucumbers

29:51.200 --> 29:54.640
and was looking for a 30 cubic yard roll-off container

29:54.640 --> 29:55.920
to put them in.

29:55.920 --> 29:59.520
The container is eight foot by 22 foot by six feet.

30:00.240 --> 30:02.080
Quite a few cucumbers.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.640
The weirdest part was the man's immediate need

30:04.640 --> 30:05.840
for the container.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.200
He was desperate.

30:07.200 --> 30:10.480
However, the cucumbers probably were still good

30:10.480 --> 30:14.000
because he invited me to come take as many as I wanted.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.360
I regret not going.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.240
Okay, wouldn't that be the last call you make?

30:20.240 --> 30:22.240
Do you think that that person's with the day on the phone

30:22.240 --> 30:24.000
calling everybody they've ever met like,

30:24.000 --> 30:26.480
hey, did you remember how you were telling me one time

30:26.480 --> 30:29.120
that you really needed a bunch of cucumbers right now?

30:29.120 --> 30:30.400
Well, good news.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.120
Come on down.

30:32.640 --> 30:35.040
Do you need pickles and have a lot of patience?

30:35.040 --> 30:35.600
Good news.

30:37.360 --> 30:42.480
This is, this is, that is so many cucumbers.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.120
I'm trying to math it out in my head,

30:45.120 --> 30:47.840
but that's like a thousand feet of cucumbers.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.040
And I think you fit-

30:49.040 --> 30:49.840
It's a lot of cucumbers.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.680
I think you could fit like a bunch of,

30:51.680 --> 30:54.800
a bunch of cuques per foot, right?

30:55.920 --> 30:58.960
And the only explanation is that

30:58.960 --> 31:01.280
it's some kind of like rolled doll situation

31:01.280 --> 31:04.400
where it's like the man who wished for too many cucumbers

31:04.400 --> 31:06.000
and like he made a wish like,

31:06.000 --> 31:07.280
oh Lord, I just love,

31:07.280 --> 31:09.680
I wish I had more cucumbers than I knew what to do with.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.960
I just love them so much

31:10.960 --> 31:13.440
because how do you, how does that sneak up on you?

31:13.440 --> 31:15.440
How do you wake up one day and you're like,

31:15.440 --> 31:16.480
where the, hold on.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.640
Oh shit, I have too many cucumbers.

31:18.640 --> 31:23.360
James, James and the many, many, many regular size peaches.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.000
I've done that, I've done that to myself before.

31:26.000 --> 31:26.880
You go to the store and you're like,

31:26.880 --> 31:28.000
do I have cucumbers at home?

31:28.720 --> 31:30.080
No, I don't think I do.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.040
Yeah, I should get some more.

31:31.040 --> 31:34.320
And then you do that 10,000 times in a day.

31:34.960 --> 31:35.920
I'm in there.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.040
I know how, I know what that's like.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.040
Maybe, Travis, you mentioned pickles.

31:39.040 --> 31:40.560
Maybe this was not for disposal.

31:40.560 --> 31:43.760
Maybe this was, I need to make a lot of pickles now.

31:43.760 --> 31:44.000
Yeah.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.480
I want to, I have a Scrooge McDuck fetish,

31:46.480 --> 31:50.640
but with a weird twist, instead of coins.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.400
Trav, do you have any more before we?

31:52.400 --> 31:54.160
Just, those are the two that I pulled.

31:54.160 --> 31:57.200
I don't, I don't want it to become a trash show, Justin.

31:57.840 --> 31:58.640
That's fine.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.280
Any more so than it already definitely is.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.080
Let's get amazing.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.880
Folks, I want to tell you about Squarespace.

32:14.880 --> 32:17.680
My brother, my brother, me is supported by Squarespace,

32:18.240 --> 32:20.080
which doesn't have anything to do with it.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.800
This is, listen, this is completely independent.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.560
Just a commercial I decided to do.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.080
And they also gave us money for it.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.760
Whether you need a landing page, a beautiful gallery,

32:27.760 --> 32:29.600
a professional blog, or an online store,

32:29.600 --> 32:32.160
it's all included with your Squarespace website.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.720
It's easy to create a website with Squarespace.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.600
I can vouch for that.

32:35.600 --> 32:36.720
Travis can vouch for that.

32:37.360 --> 32:40.960
If you've never done it before, this is the place to start.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.200
Everybody's making web pages now.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.840
And it's time to stake your claim in the great Wild West.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.520
And the best part is they're gonna give you

32:47.520 --> 32:51.280
a free custom domain to help people get to your thing.

32:51.280 --> 32:52.640
That's not actually the freest thing.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.080
They're just giving you letters.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.840
That's not, I said it's the best.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.120
That's just some free letters.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.880
That's not actually the best, but it is good.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.360
There's beautiful templates.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.440
You can design a best in class online store

33:03.440 --> 33:04.960
with Squarespace's award-winning templates,

33:04.960 --> 33:06.560
customizable settings, and more.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.680
All without a single plugin.

33:07.680 --> 33:10.320
If you need to make a web page, and you do,

33:10.320 --> 33:11.760
because otherwise nobody knows,

33:11.760 --> 33:13.680
how can I Google you if you don't have a web page?

33:13.680 --> 33:14.160
I can't.

33:14.160 --> 33:14.880
That's the answer.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.720
You gotta work on your SEO, I think.

33:17.280 --> 33:20.560
Yeah, fix your SEO and start your free trial today

33:20.560 --> 33:23.040

33:23.040 --> 33:27.440
Get 10% off your first purchase of your own personal website.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.800
I can vouch, like Justin said,

33:28.800 --> 33:31.920
I made macroyshows.com on Squarespace.

33:31.920 --> 33:35.120
It took me like 45 minutes, like nothing.

33:35.120 --> 33:38.480
And it's so easy to update so we can like add new stuff to it

33:38.480 --> 33:41.920
and, you know, add pictures, change stuff to it whenever we need to.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.080
And it was like no time at all.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.160
And it looks really good.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.200
I'm very proud of it.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.800
And it was really easy.

33:48.800 --> 33:51.120
So like, I'm a big fan of Squarespace.

33:51.760 --> 33:55.360
And not only that, like their customer service is amazing.

33:56.640 --> 33:57.680
It's so easy to figure out.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.200
And if you do have an issue, there's someone to help you.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.440
Plus, like YouTube is full of videos

34:01.440 --> 34:03.360
about how to make it look even better.

34:03.360 --> 34:04.320
Like it's amazing.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.560
You really want to use Squarespace.

34:06.560 --> 34:07.440
I'm a big fan.

34:07.440 --> 34:10.240
Can they, it says you get free custom domain.

34:10.240 --> 34:12.080
And I'm very excited about that.

34:12.640 --> 34:15.760
Can they just get me KarateDog.com?

34:15.760 --> 34:17.360
Because I just went to it and it's available,

34:17.360 --> 34:18.960
but it's for sale for $2,800.

34:21.120 --> 34:24.160
And like, will they foot the bill for that?

34:24.160 --> 34:25.280
Or am I going to have to pay for that?

34:25.280 --> 34:26.480
Or how does the-

34:26.480 --> 34:28.400
Griffin, it's going to pay for itself.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.040
I want to tell you guys about another sponsor we have this week,

34:33.040 --> 34:34.000
which is MeUndies.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.360
MeUndies is, it's just the best undies.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.520
I'm, I'm, I think I'm, let me check.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.040
I'm wearing a pair right now.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.000
Me too.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.120
Which, me too.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.320
What fun designer, you guys,

34:44.320 --> 34:45.680
you guys have this like summer one

34:45.680 --> 34:47.760
with all the inflatable toys and stuff.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.800
No, mine's blue and it's got leaves and stuff on it.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.960
Wait, shit, Griffin, are we wearing the same one?

34:52.960 --> 34:54.400
Aw, bud, yeah, it happened.

34:54.400 --> 34:54.720
Love that, love that.

34:54.720 --> 34:56.800
Yeah, synergy.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.800
Synergy, corporate synergy.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.240
Whether you're wearing a suit or you're wearing sweats,

35:02.240 --> 35:04.080
I mean, those are the only two things I wear.

35:05.280 --> 35:05.840
You're going to spend-

35:05.840 --> 35:07.520
Or a sweatsuit.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.600
You're spending 24 hours a day in your undies,

35:10.960 --> 35:13.120
but your underwear is probably pretty boring

35:13.120 --> 35:14.400
and probably pretty uncomfortable

35:14.400 --> 35:17.120
and it probably starts, you probably have like-

35:17.120 --> 35:18.320
It's probably evil.

35:18.320 --> 35:22.000
Just a few tablespoons of just water in there at any time.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.160
I want to tell you about MeUndies

35:24.160 --> 35:26.480
because MeUndies is made of sustainably sourced modal,

35:26.480 --> 35:28.960
which is a fabric that's twice as soft as cotton.

35:28.960 --> 35:33.600
It's indescribably soft and it indescribably fits good.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.920
And you're going to know why they're called the world's

35:35.920 --> 35:37.200
most comfortable underwear.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.720
And if you don't have your first pair of MeUndies,

35:38.720 --> 35:40.400
they're free, no questions asked.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.840
Shipping's free in the US and Canada

35:41.840 --> 35:43.280
and you can save up to $8 a pair

35:43.280 --> 35:45.120
with the MeUndies subscription plan.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.800
And in order to get down on that plan

35:46.800 --> 35:47.760
or get a single pair,

35:47.760 --> 35:50.000
you can get 20% off your first order

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
if you go to MeUndies.com slash my brother.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.400
That's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.400
Get 20% off your first order.

35:56.400 --> 35:59.280
One more time, MeUndies.com slash my brother.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.040
You know what I do whenever I get MeUndies?

36:01.040 --> 36:03.760
I throw, we get the monthly thing.

36:03.760 --> 36:04.880
So every month we get a new pair.

36:05.920 --> 36:06.960
And whenever I get one,

36:06.960 --> 36:09.920
I throw a pair of non-MeUndies away

36:09.920 --> 36:14.400
and I am so close to reaching 100% MeUndies.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.400
I'm within striking distance.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.760
Let me tell you, I've done it in my cross country move.

36:19.760 --> 36:23.120
Not a single old pair of stupid old underwear

36:23.120 --> 36:24.240
made its way with me.

36:24.240 --> 36:26.240
It's all MeUndies, I'm never looking back.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.960
I'm going whole hog, by which I mean,

36:28.960 --> 36:31.120
the only thing my hog will touch.

36:31.120 --> 36:34.240
I mean my penis.

36:34.240 --> 36:37.920
I can't wait for next week's edition of Trash Stories,

36:37.920 --> 36:41.840
which is like, I was cleaning out some dude's apartment trash.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.480
First of all, I stole his patio furniture.

36:44.480 --> 36:45.440
That was tight.

36:45.440 --> 36:46.640
I'm pretty sure that was trash

36:46.640 --> 36:49.360
because it was in basically essentially a big trash tarp.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.640
Anyway, went in through just like looking around,

36:52.640 --> 36:54.640
just perusing for treasure

36:54.640 --> 36:57.440
and just replaced my whole underwear collection

36:57.440 --> 36:58.400
with bad underwear.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.320
But oh well.

37:00.320 --> 37:04.560
I've got a personal message here for Ross from Megan.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.640
Happy fifth anniversary.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.800
I'm so glad I could get the guys whose voices

37:08.800 --> 37:11.040
you probably know better than my own to tell you.

37:11.680 --> 37:12.880
Next available.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.040
I really hope, the reason I said the next available

37:15.040 --> 37:17.680
is I really hope that this is five months later

37:17.680 --> 37:21.920
and like Megan withheld saying happy fifth anniversary

37:21.920 --> 37:24.080
to Ross until we could say it.

37:24.080 --> 37:26.640
And Ross was like, hey, happy fifth anniversary.

37:26.640 --> 37:27.680
And Megan just went, mm-hmm.

37:27.680 --> 37:31.040
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yep.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.400
It is a happy mm.

37:32.400 --> 37:35.440
Yep, mm, yep, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

37:35.440 --> 37:36.080
You'll see.

37:38.560 --> 37:39.280
In five months.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.520
Here's one for the brothers and family.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.520
This is just for all of us to enjoy.

37:45.520 --> 37:47.520
And this is from Timbo in Austin.

37:47.520 --> 37:50.160
It says, dear brothers, sorry if this isn't goofable.

37:50.160 --> 37:51.280
I wanted to say thank you

37:51.280 --> 37:53.360
for letting us feel like a part of your family.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.680
For some of us, it's a profound experience

37:55.680 --> 37:56.960
that can get us through tough times.

37:56.960 --> 37:58.720
Just like the holidays.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.000
Oops-a-daisy.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.600
Just wanted to make you know, sure you all knew

38:03.600 --> 38:05.600
you provide the world with more than just

38:05.600 --> 38:07.280
those sweet, sweet goose.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.160
Good job.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.600
Did I do it right?

38:09.600 --> 38:10.880
That's from Timbo in Austin.

38:10.880 --> 38:11.600
Thank you, Tim.

38:11.600 --> 38:12.240
That's very kind.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.680
You mentioned the holidays.

38:13.680 --> 38:13.920
Yeah.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.400
So I hope the way we've repaid your kind message

38:16.400 --> 38:19.200
was waiting eight months to read it.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.080
I think that was the cause of Justin's oops-a-daisy,

38:22.080 --> 38:24.160
not the fact that we help people get through the holidays

38:24.160 --> 38:24.720
with our podcast.

38:24.720 --> 38:25.120
Yeah, that was the oops-a-daisy.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.560
That's all we're helping to do the holiday?

38:26.560 --> 38:27.060
Shit.

38:27.060 --> 38:27.680
Oh, no.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.680
Oops-a-daisy, this was like December 25th.

38:29.680 --> 38:31.200
Tim writes this very kind message,

38:31.200 --> 38:32.880
and we're like, yeah, Timbo, we're

38:32.880 --> 38:34.880
going to get to that real soon, my man.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.160
Yeah, welcome to the family.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.480
Sit right there for eight literal months.

38:39.120 --> 38:43.840
Sit in our virtual reading room until fall,

38:43.840 --> 38:46.000
and then we're going to get to this very kind message.

38:46.000 --> 38:46.720
But thank you, Tim.

38:46.720 --> 38:47.520
That was very nice.

38:47.520 --> 38:48.160
Thank you.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.040
Very nice of you.

38:49.760 --> 38:53.280
Mugs, shirts, stickers, patches, tanks, and more

38:53.280 --> 38:56.400
are yours for the purchasing at maxfundstore.com.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.400
Hey, you already love the podcasts,

38:58.400 --> 39:00.560
so why not take this to the next level

39:00.560 --> 39:05.360
and outfit your home and bod with our merch, maxfundstore.com,

39:05.360 --> 39:06.800
because if you have to wear a shirt,

39:06.800 --> 39:08.080
it should be one of ours.

39:10.480 --> 39:13.280
Brothers, my husband has spent every free moment

39:13.280 --> 39:15.680
of the past six months building and perfecting

39:15.680 --> 39:19.040
a screen-accurate replica of a Stormtrooper's armor.

39:19.680 --> 39:22.480
Not only that, but he's constructed a custom blaster

39:22.480 --> 39:24.720
with some sick lights and sound effects.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.400
This is just, this is not going to be a question.

39:26.400 --> 39:26.960
I can feel it, right?

39:26.960 --> 39:28.160
This is just braggy.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.600
This is a person who's talking about how cool.

39:30.560 --> 39:32.560
I have never been more proud, correct?

39:32.560 --> 39:34.880
But alas, he is hiding his light under a bushel

39:34.880 --> 39:37.600
for fear of what others, friends, family, coworkers

39:37.600 --> 39:38.320
will think.

39:38.320 --> 39:41.440
He was recently accepted to the 501st Legion,

39:41.440 --> 39:43.040
and I wanted to sing his praises,

39:43.040 --> 39:45.120
but I held back out of respect for his wishes.

39:45.760 --> 39:47.840
Is there any way I can convince him

39:47.840 --> 39:49.680
to take his awesomeness public?

39:49.680 --> 39:52.320
And that's just from Gmail.

39:52.320 --> 39:58.400
First of all, the 501st Legion is a Legion of Stormtroopers

39:59.520 --> 40:02.800
that, like, they do marches, they attend events,

40:02.800 --> 40:06.720
they're like a really big deal Star Wars, like,

40:06.720 --> 40:08.400
battalion of fans.

40:08.400 --> 40:10.960
That's a really cool honor.

40:10.960 --> 40:13.520
And you have to have, like, perfect armor to join,

40:13.520 --> 40:15.360
and they do, like, lots of charity work,

40:15.360 --> 40:17.760
and they visit hospitals, and when the rebellion comes,

40:17.760 --> 40:21.520
they will be the fucking first to stand against it and crush it.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.560
Do they have one of these types of groups

40:25.360 --> 40:32.000
for Austin Powerses that I could get sent in my audition tape for?

40:32.560 --> 40:34.960
But it would probably be called, like, the 69th Legion,

40:34.960 --> 40:37.360
because that's, like, Austin Powers, right?

40:37.360 --> 40:38.080
You got it.

40:38.080 --> 40:39.360
Swinging groovy, yes.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.520
Yes, that is exactly it.

40:41.520 --> 40:42.880
Congratulations, Travis.

40:42.880 --> 40:43.760
Thank you very much.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.360
My bag is a man, yes.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.040
That is my bag, baby.

40:47.040 --> 40:47.760
You have found it.

40:48.800 --> 40:50.560
Thank you for returning my bag to me.

40:51.200 --> 40:51.920
Crunky.

40:51.920 --> 40:52.960
Crunky, my mojo's gone.

40:55.520 --> 40:58.560
I think that this is actually a big opportunity,

40:58.560 --> 41:01.760
because you are the only one who knows his secret identity.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.480
So you could start to read stories in the newspaper

41:04.480 --> 41:06.720
of, like, a mysterious stormtrooper.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.000
Oh my god.

41:08.000 --> 41:08.880
Yeah, I'm sorry.

41:08.880 --> 41:09.760
Yes, Travis.

41:09.760 --> 41:10.640
Yeah, this is the bet.

41:10.640 --> 41:13.120
Like, don't take this awesomeness public.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.480
Let him keep it secret.

41:14.480 --> 41:17.600
Because if I went over to one of any of my friend's houses

41:17.600 --> 41:18.560
right now, and they're like,

41:18.560 --> 41:20.240
I think it's time that I show you something.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.000
And then they, like, pull down on the book,

41:22.720 --> 41:25.920
and they're on their bookshelf,

41:25.920 --> 41:27.120
and then it rotates out,

41:27.120 --> 41:30.240
revealing their perfect fucking stormtrooper armor.

41:30.240 --> 41:33.840
That person would be a legend forever in my mind.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.840
I would never forget that moment.

41:35.840 --> 41:36.240
Right?

41:36.240 --> 41:37.120
Yeah, that would be amazing.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.320
You don't want that to be public.

41:38.320 --> 41:41.120
You want it to be a secret that you share with, like,

41:41.120 --> 41:42.640
secrets are cool too.

41:42.640 --> 41:44.000
You know, it may just be,

41:44.000 --> 41:45.840
you know how sometimes I like to wear

41:45.840 --> 41:48.160
one of my sexier pairs of me undies underneath

41:48.160 --> 41:49.280
when I head into the office,

41:49.280 --> 41:51.920
just to make me feel like I'm hiding a little secret.

41:51.920 --> 41:52.560
You know what I mean?

41:52.560 --> 41:54.960
And I think that maybe this could be that for him.

41:54.960 --> 41:56.400
Maybe he wants that, like,

41:57.040 --> 41:59.200
feeling of knowing he does have a secret.

41:59.200 --> 42:00.000
Like, if somebody's like,

42:00.640 --> 42:02.800
yeah, as if you could ever show up in the office

42:02.800 --> 42:03.760
dressed like a stormtrooper,

42:03.760 --> 42:05.920
and he's like, uh-huh, you got me again, Doug.

42:05.920 --> 42:06.880
But in his back, his head's up.

42:06.880 --> 42:08.800
With your weirdly specific bullying.

42:08.800 --> 42:17.600
Doug always knows just which buttons to push with pin-point accuracy.

42:19.280 --> 42:21.840
With blaster-like specificity.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.760
He knows exactly where to shoot.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.400
I think that that's the question.

42:26.400 --> 42:27.360
Justin is correct.

42:27.360 --> 42:30.400
Is this a, no, this is just for me kind of thing?

42:30.400 --> 42:31.760
Because that's awesome.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.520
But if this is, like, him going,

42:33.520 --> 42:35.360
I don't know, I'm afraid that I'd, like,

42:35.360 --> 42:36.320
people wouldn't like it.

42:36.320 --> 42:37.520
I think that's so far off.

42:37.520 --> 42:40.000
I don't know, especially in this day and age

42:40.000 --> 42:42.240
where Star Wars has become so mainstream,

42:42.880 --> 42:45.600
I don't know anyone who wouldn't be like,

42:45.600 --> 42:46.640
that's awesome.

42:47.280 --> 42:50.240
And not only that, because I think people also respond well

42:50.240 --> 42:54.080
to, like, when you put care and time into a thing.

42:54.080 --> 42:56.640
And if they don't, like, their opinions don't matter.

42:56.640 --> 42:59.200
But especially when you say, like, friends and family,

42:59.840 --> 43:03.200
like, if they react shittily, they ain't your friends,

43:03.200 --> 43:05.440
and you should discount them as family as well.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.600
Because something like that, that you, like,

43:07.600 --> 43:09.840
put so much time and effort and, like,

43:09.840 --> 43:11.840
really focus your energy on,

43:12.560 --> 43:14.560
I would think that anybody worth their salt

43:14.560 --> 43:16.400
would think that that was amazing.

43:16.400 --> 43:19.600
Unless it's family's all hardcore Star Trek nerds.

43:21.440 --> 43:24.160
They've been building their accurate Borg costumes.

43:24.720 --> 43:28.160
Yeah, I guess that's the only thing they got, right?

43:28.160 --> 43:29.360
Like, what else would it be?

43:29.360 --> 43:32.960
Like, here's my Klingon pants.

43:33.760 --> 43:34.960
I made a Batleth.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.040
This is a couple coat hangers that you twist around

43:37.040 --> 43:37.680
a butter knife.

43:38.560 --> 43:43.360
It is gonna make hanging out with the 501st Legion buddies

43:43.360 --> 43:44.720
a little bit awkward.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.640
If, like, after they visit the hospital,

43:46.640 --> 43:49.360
they're all taking their armor off and heading in to

43:49.360 --> 43:51.840
slam some Gatorade and go over to Chuck E. Cheese's

43:51.840 --> 43:53.760
or Billy Bob's Wonderland, depending on where they live.

43:54.320 --> 43:57.440
And they're like, well, how about you, new fella?

43:57.440 --> 43:58.400
How did you think of it?

43:58.400 --> 43:59.520
All right, it was fun.

44:00.080 --> 44:02.560
Well, you can go ahead and, no, I'm good.

44:02.560 --> 44:07.040
I'm just gonna leave it on, I think.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.400
Well, okay.

44:08.400 --> 44:10.320
I don't have a lot of room in my Ford Fiesta,

44:10.320 --> 44:11.920
and I did offer to give you a ride with me,

44:11.920 --> 44:13.520
but that's fine if you-

44:13.520 --> 44:14.560
Yeah, I'm fine.

44:14.560 --> 44:16.000
I'll hop in the back.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.840
Let's all take a big group picture.

44:17.840 --> 44:18.480
Masks off.

44:18.480 --> 44:19.200
What do you say, guys?

44:20.160 --> 44:21.360
I've actually got to go.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.000
Traitor!

44:22.880 --> 44:25.440
That's a little Star Wars joke for everybody in the audience.

44:25.440 --> 44:27.520
He pulls off his helmet and it's Mark Hamill.

44:27.520 --> 44:29.440
I was like, what the fuck?

44:29.440 --> 44:32.720
Travis did a fun joke, too, from Star Wars.

44:32.720 --> 44:33.200
Thank you.

44:34.560 --> 44:38.640
Who's your favorite Star Wars?

44:40.640 --> 44:42.960
That would be the fucking funniest bit, wouldn't it?

44:42.960 --> 44:45.680
Like, roll up to the 500 first and just be like,

44:46.560 --> 44:48.640
who's your guys' favorite Star Wars?

44:51.040 --> 44:55.360
Which one of the Starmen do you think has the best super powers?

44:55.360 --> 44:59.840
I like Iron Man, Izzy.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.040
I like Bando.

45:03.920 --> 45:05.600
What happened to Jango Phat?

45:05.600 --> 45:05.840
Who?

45:06.880 --> 45:07.760
Jango-

45:07.760 --> 45:09.120
The Jango Unchained.

45:09.120 --> 45:09.840
Jango Phat?

45:11.360 --> 45:12.080
Jango Phat.

45:13.040 --> 45:13.840
Do you guys know Yahoo?

45:14.400 --> 45:14.640
Sure.

45:15.440 --> 45:19.840
If you're listening to this guy who made the Stormtrooper armor,

45:19.840 --> 45:20.880
that's awesome.

45:20.880 --> 45:21.520
Don't be ashamed.

45:21.520 --> 45:22.560
It's fucking great.

45:22.560 --> 45:24.480
How about this one sent in by Dana Scarborough?

45:24.480 --> 45:25.200
Thank you, Dana.

45:25.200 --> 45:27.440
It's by Yahoo Answers user Tim Harrington who asks,

45:28.160 --> 45:30.400
how to work on my radio voice?

45:31.360 --> 45:32.800
This is all caps, by the way.

45:32.800 --> 45:35.440
So like, I think they need work on their radio voice

45:35.440 --> 45:37.440
because right now it's just all shouting.

45:38.240 --> 45:40.880
I'm wondering how I can work on my radio voice.

45:40.880 --> 45:43.120
I'll be going to college for radio broadcasting,

45:43.120 --> 45:44.960
but how can I work on my voice?

45:44.960 --> 45:47.440
I want to do late night jazz hours

45:47.440 --> 45:50.720
and I know that you have to have a soft trained comforting voice.

45:52.720 --> 45:53.520
Interesting.

45:53.520 --> 45:54.240
What a twist.

45:54.240 --> 45:58.320
Why do you feel like you have to do that before you get to college?

45:58.320 --> 46:02.560
Listen, if they can't teach you how to have a smooth comforting jazz voice,

46:02.560 --> 46:05.440
then maybe you're overpaying for your college education.

46:05.440 --> 46:08.560
If they can't whiplash you into a smooth jazz voice,

46:08.560 --> 46:10.960
then what are you even doing at that conservatory?

46:10.960 --> 46:13.520
No, smoother, at my tempo.

46:13.520 --> 46:15.600
Hey everybody, we've got a com-

46:15.600 --> 46:16.640
No, smoother!

46:18.640 --> 46:20.480
You threw my mug of chamomile.

46:20.480 --> 46:24.400
I couldn't figure out a way to do that sound effect.

46:24.400 --> 46:25.760
Slow it down.

46:25.760 --> 46:26.960
Lower the timbre.

46:26.960 --> 46:29.440
As we all know, there's three types of radio voices.

46:29.440 --> 46:30.480
There's your JB-

46:30.480 --> 46:31.520
They're JB Millers.

46:31.520 --> 46:32.080
Oh, okay.

46:32.080 --> 46:33.920
Well, that's not a joke that anybody's going to get.

46:34.560 --> 46:37.040
Well, if they lived in Huntington, they would.

46:37.040 --> 46:39.600
Yeah, no, let's broaden our net a little bit.

46:40.480 --> 46:45.360
There's the douche and that covers, I would say, most of it.

46:45.360 --> 46:47.360
Can you give us an example, Griffin?

46:47.360 --> 46:48.800
Because that could be anything.

46:48.800 --> 46:52.560
Well, and again, this has nothing to do with the personality of the person.

46:52.560 --> 46:53.600
It's just the voice, right?

46:53.600 --> 46:57.360
So it's just like, hey everybody, here I come, doing my voice.

46:57.360 --> 47:00.960
Nobody talks like this, but here I come at you with the weather on the 10s.

47:00.960 --> 47:04.160
And he's on the 10 and the nine and the eight and the seven.

47:04.160 --> 47:05.520
He's running very slowly.

47:05.520 --> 47:08.800
If I can announce each yard that he's crossing and touchdown.

47:08.800 --> 47:11.280
Come on down to Blockbuster Video.

47:11.280 --> 47:12.960
Have we got a deal for you?

47:12.960 --> 47:14.080
Coming up after the break,

47:14.080 --> 47:16.480
Toni Bazel's back with her follow-up to Mickey.

47:16.480 --> 47:18.800
Mickey too, and also Bob Carlisle.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.560
He is dropping it.

47:20.560 --> 47:24.000
BK2, we got the world premiere streaming from Tidal.

47:25.040 --> 47:27.360
And then, but that voice could also be like shock jock,

47:27.360 --> 47:29.200
like Bob Carlisle's in the studio.

47:29.200 --> 47:31.040
He's got a nut out.

47:31.040 --> 47:32.320
I can't believe this.

47:32.320 --> 47:33.680
Show us your boob.

47:33.680 --> 47:36.000
Show us your boob, Bob Carlisle.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.120
Loving it, loving it.

47:37.680 --> 47:40.080
Bob Carlisle getting wet and wild.

47:40.080 --> 47:43.680
Playing strip poker with Bob Carlisle in the studio.

47:43.680 --> 47:46.320
And he has lost his shirt and his pants.

47:46.320 --> 47:47.840
And he's got a nut out.

47:47.840 --> 47:49.520
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah.

47:49.520 --> 47:52.400
I can see Bob Carlisle's butthole and everything.

47:52.400 --> 47:53.200
It's great.

47:53.200 --> 47:55.440
Using him like a butterfly periscope.

47:56.400 --> 47:59.120
Next up, we paid homeless Reggie 50 bucks

47:59.120 --> 48:01.440
to smell Bob Carlisle's taint.

48:04.720 --> 48:06.080
Now here's butterfly kisses too.

48:07.760 --> 48:08.800
Too hot for TV.

48:11.200 --> 48:13.120
Unedited explicit tag.

48:13.120 --> 48:14.080
Okay, so that's one voice.

48:14.080 --> 48:15.040
That's one voice.

48:15.040 --> 48:17.680
And then there's soft voice.

48:18.320 --> 48:19.040
And this covers-

48:19.040 --> 48:20.960
Like your NPR voice?

48:20.960 --> 48:23.600
Yeah, but that could also just be jazz.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.920
Like, hey everybody, this is Griffin.

48:26.560 --> 48:28.240
I gotta stop doing stuff like that

48:28.240 --> 48:31.120
because I do get a lot of ASMR sort of reports in.

48:31.120 --> 48:32.800
Just like, hey, you did it for me, thanks.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
I'm glad that that's a service we provide.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.880
I guess so too, but it's not my intention

48:38.880 --> 48:41.280
unless I explicitly say that it is.

48:41.280 --> 48:42.480
It feels like a violation.

48:42.480 --> 48:45.600
But it's like, hey everybody, this is my soft voice.

48:45.600 --> 48:49.520
And coming up on the weather on the 10s

48:49.520 --> 48:53.520
and also a thing happened in this country

48:53.520 --> 48:55.760
and Griffin couldn't even think of an example

48:55.760 --> 48:57.280
of what that might be.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.360
My favorite thing about that voice,

48:59.360 --> 49:02.000
especially in like a smooth jazz station setting,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.400
is that the history of some of these artists

49:04.400 --> 49:07.040
is very, it could be very murky.

49:07.040 --> 49:08.000
There can be some bets.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.520
So to use that voice to be like,

49:09.520 --> 49:13.920
and while on a heroin bender, he stabbed three people

49:13.920 --> 49:17.440
and then went on to write, stars in the sky, enjoy.

49:17.440 --> 49:20.080
Like that voice, like that to me

49:20.080 --> 49:21.680
is like the best part of that voice.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.760
It's like you could say really horrendous things

49:23.760 --> 49:25.600
on that voice, people are like, oh, that's nice.

49:25.600 --> 49:26.960
It's really pleasant.

49:26.960 --> 49:29.600
And you gotta be careful not to juxtapose

49:29.600 --> 49:31.040
because you don't want to turn on your radio

49:31.040 --> 49:34.720
and hear somebody say, and then next up we paid

49:34.720 --> 49:39.720
homeless Reggie $50 to smell Bob Carlisle's taint.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.760
It makes it even sonically more unpleasant.

49:43.760 --> 49:48.760
And then the third one, of course, is.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.560
Oh no, Griffin said there were three.

49:52.960 --> 49:54.080
No, I got this.

49:55.200 --> 49:59.680
The third one is of course, impressions.

49:59.680 --> 50:04.680
You know, that classic radio voice, impressions.

50:05.840 --> 50:10.960
The mainstay of every used car ad that's ever been.

50:10.960 --> 50:12.800
It's like, hey everybody, I'm Austin Powers.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.520
Come on down to Roger Beasley Toyota

50:15.520 --> 50:19.440
and get yourself a Prius, baby, my wife.

50:19.440 --> 50:20.320
You should buy this.

50:20.320 --> 50:22.560
Wait, I wasn't even doing a voice.

50:22.560 --> 50:24.000
You should buy this car.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.360
I can't do any voices.

50:25.360 --> 50:26.160
What was I doing?

50:26.160 --> 50:27.040
Who is that?

50:27.040 --> 50:28.320
Who was that, Travis?

50:28.320 --> 50:29.520
I'm so scared.

50:29.520 --> 50:30.800
I was trying to do Bill Clinton,

50:30.800 --> 50:32.160
but it sounded like Keanu Reeves.

50:33.280 --> 50:34.080
Bill Clinton is hard.

50:34.080 --> 50:35.840
I'm gonna try to just leap in, let me see.

50:35.840 --> 50:36.720
Yeah, just like leap in.

50:36.720 --> 50:39.680
Come on down for Beasley Toyota.

50:40.320 --> 50:44.640
I didn't inhale, but you should inhale these deals.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.040
Is that good?

50:47.040 --> 50:48.240
I know kung fu.

50:54.240 --> 50:55.520
Dude, you're getting a Dell.

50:55.520 --> 51:00.480
Come on down to Roger Beasley Toyota

51:00.480 --> 51:02.240
and come get yourself a Dell.

51:03.360 --> 51:05.280
It's me, President Barack Obama.

51:05.840 --> 51:06.880
Where is the beef?

51:06.880 --> 51:08.480
It's at Bob Carlyle Toyota.

51:13.760 --> 51:16.080
It's me, President Barack Hussein Obama.

51:16.080 --> 51:17.520
A lot of people forget the Hussein, but it's important.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.240
And pizza, pizza.

51:21.440 --> 51:23.520
Come on down to my Toyota town.

51:23.520 --> 51:24.800
Come on, fuck.

51:25.520 --> 51:27.120
Oh, shit, you can't fucking curse.

51:27.120 --> 51:27.840
No, that's three.

51:30.160 --> 51:31.200
Did you guys ever...

51:33.520 --> 51:35.040
Travis, you're excluded from this question

51:35.040 --> 51:36.000
because we know the answer.

51:36.000 --> 51:40.880
Do you guys ever attempt to do an impression cold?

51:40.880 --> 51:41.200
Yeah.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.880
Maybe just around friends and family

51:42.880 --> 51:46.000
and it comes out note perfect

51:46.560 --> 51:48.320
and then you can never capture it again?

51:48.320 --> 51:51.840
You can never get back into the groove of it?

51:51.840 --> 51:52.160
No.

51:52.160 --> 51:53.920
Why am I excluded from this?

51:53.920 --> 51:54.880
Because we know you can't.

51:55.440 --> 51:56.640
I heard you're Bill Clinton.

51:56.640 --> 51:57.520
Yeah, I can't.

51:57.520 --> 51:58.640
Okay, I can't.

51:58.640 --> 52:01.760
I have no control over my voice at all

52:01.760 --> 52:03.120
until it leaves my mouth.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.960
And then I have to do a slow tuning in

52:04.960 --> 52:07.360
that takes me about a week to get to any impression

52:07.360 --> 52:08.640
and then I immediately lose it.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Last week when I didn't even wind up,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.640
I just like busted into a pitch perfect Roger Klotz.

52:14.640 --> 52:16.000
I didn't know that that was inside of me,

52:16.000 --> 52:18.240
but I just opened up my mouth and a little bird came out.

52:18.240 --> 52:19.840
And then you did the impression.

52:19.840 --> 52:21.360
And then I did the impression.

52:21.360 --> 52:22.320
Folks, that's gonna do it for us.

52:22.320 --> 52:23.920
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

52:23.920 --> 52:25.840
We hope you've enjoyed your time with us.

52:25.840 --> 52:28.560
Can you do an impression when you do the outro?

52:28.560 --> 52:29.600
It's so boring.

52:29.600 --> 52:31.040
I hate doing it every time.

52:31.040 --> 52:32.160
I think it would spice it up

52:32.160 --> 52:34.480
if we just did a little bit of like a fun voice.

52:34.480 --> 52:35.200
Who do you want?

52:36.080 --> 52:37.120
Yes, yes.

52:37.120 --> 52:39.360
We will all do celebrity impersonations,

52:39.360 --> 52:40.640
but I will not pick.

52:40.640 --> 52:42.880
You guys have to tell me who the celebrity

52:42.880 --> 52:44.160
I am to impersonate is.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.280
Gwyneth Paltrow.

52:45.280 --> 52:45.760
Oh, no.

52:45.760 --> 52:46.720
Okay, that's ridiculous.

52:46.720 --> 52:48.240
She doesn't have a specific speaking style.

52:48.240 --> 52:49.520
She does too.

52:49.520 --> 52:51.520
No, she's a-

52:51.520 --> 52:52.720
Okay, go on Travis.

52:52.720 --> 52:53.120
Wait, sorry.

52:53.120 --> 52:54.080
Fuck, that was Ringo Starr.

52:54.080 --> 52:54.880
You're Gwyneth Paltrow.

52:54.880 --> 52:56.080
No, you're Gwyneth Paltrow now.

52:56.800 --> 52:58.320
Can I be Andre the Giant?

52:58.320 --> 52:58.880
Yes.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.400
Yeah, you can be Andre the Giant.

53:00.400 --> 53:01.360
You don't get to pick your own.

53:01.360 --> 53:01.840
Who am I?

53:02.720 --> 53:04.400
Why don't you be Andre the Giant?

53:04.400 --> 53:06.240
Oh, sounds like what are they doing?

53:06.240 --> 53:07.680
Andre the Giant.

53:07.680 --> 53:11.600
Justin, I want you to do Michael Keaton.

53:11.600 --> 53:14.080
These are the weirdest impression requests ever.

53:14.720 --> 53:16.160
What the fuck, Travis?

53:16.160 --> 53:20.800
I'll do Andrew Jackson.

53:20.800 --> 53:22.240
I'll do Bob Carlisle.

53:23.120 --> 53:26.160
We do have a big announcement.

53:30.560 --> 53:31.200
Hello, folks.

53:31.200 --> 53:32.560
This is Travis McElroy coming to you

53:32.560 --> 53:33.760
with a very special announcement.

53:35.200 --> 53:38.240
We are doing a candlelight show this year.

53:38.240 --> 53:39.200
But wait a minute.

53:39.200 --> 53:40.000
Well, wait a minute.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.120
We said that we wouldn't because you and I are having babies

53:43.120 --> 53:44.720
like right around then.

53:44.720 --> 53:45.440
Yeah, Griffin.

53:45.440 --> 53:46.560
But here's the twist.

53:46.560 --> 53:48.000
We're doing it in September

53:48.000 --> 53:50.320
because candlelight is whenever you want it to be.

53:50.320 --> 53:52.000
And that's when we're all going to be in Huntington.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.280
So that's when we want it to be.

53:53.280 --> 53:57.120
And sometimes you just feel that holiday spirit coming around

53:58.160 --> 54:00.640
while you're shooting a television show for CSO.

54:01.440 --> 54:02.800
And sometimes you need a special.

54:05.520 --> 54:08.080
You need live footage of you doing your podcast

54:08.080 --> 54:10.000
for the television show that you're making.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Sometimes the stars just align like that.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.120
Yeah, sometimes you grab the stars by their stupid faces

54:15.120 --> 54:16.640
and say, get in a line.

54:16.640 --> 54:18.320
Get in a line, stars.

54:18.320 --> 54:19.360
September 30th.

54:20.480 --> 54:23.680
So we will have more details coming and ticket links

54:23.680 --> 54:24.640
and all that stuff on Twitter.

54:25.360 --> 54:27.360
We're trying to put the tickets on sale this week.

54:27.360 --> 54:29.040
So like before the next episode goes up.

54:29.040 --> 54:31.360
So we'll tweet ahead of time to let everyone know

54:31.360 --> 54:32.320
when they'll be going on sale.

54:32.320 --> 54:35.040
But pay attention to the NBNBM Twitter.

54:35.040 --> 54:36.560
September 30th in Huntington.

54:36.560 --> 54:38.160
We're going to be doing a candlelight special

54:39.120 --> 54:41.440
with Sawbones and maybe Schmaners.

54:41.440 --> 54:43.680
And we will be filming parts of it

54:43.680 --> 54:45.440
and putting it on the CSO show.

54:45.440 --> 54:47.840
We know this is coming in hot.

54:49.200 --> 54:52.400
It really isn't like we think it's going to be a lot of fun.

54:52.400 --> 54:56.000
Otherwise, we can't do any more live shows this year

54:56.000 --> 54:57.040
after this basically.

54:58.400 --> 55:00.800
So this is like our last chance to do this thing.

55:00.800 --> 55:01.760
And it's coming in kind of hot.

55:01.760 --> 55:03.600
But it's because this idea was,

55:04.480 --> 55:06.080
it popped up only very recently.

55:06.080 --> 55:08.160
So candlelights in September.

55:08.160 --> 55:09.680
September 30th in Huntington.

55:09.680 --> 55:11.360
More details to come probably this week.

55:11.360 --> 55:13.200
Watch our Twitter at NBNBAM.

55:13.200 --> 55:16.880
This isn't specifically related to this show.

55:16.880 --> 55:18.160
But we make another show.

55:18.160 --> 55:19.200
It's called The Adventure Zone.

55:19.200 --> 55:21.120
It's a D&D podcast we make with our dad.

55:21.920 --> 55:25.360
And a bunch of folks who listen to that show

55:25.360 --> 55:28.480
led by Megan Raley and with help from Carrie Peach

55:29.440 --> 55:32.320
have made a project called The Adventure Zine

55:32.320 --> 55:34.320
where it's a collection of fan art.

55:34.880 --> 55:39.040
And all the profits from this fan art book

55:39.040 --> 55:41.200
are going to go to Facing Hunger.

55:41.200 --> 55:44.400
Which is a Huntington-based food bank.

55:45.200 --> 55:46.960
And it's a really cool project.

55:46.960 --> 55:49.280
And they have raised a ton of money already.

55:49.280 --> 55:51.840
But you will definitely want to get a copy of this.

55:51.840 --> 55:52.480
Yeah, I know.

55:52.480 --> 55:55.040
It's out of control.

55:55.040 --> 56:00.320
Theadventurezine.com is the address to go

56:00.320 --> 56:01.760
if you want to get a copy.

56:01.760 --> 56:04.800
And this isn't like a book that's going to be widely made

56:04.800 --> 56:05.920
and then sold in stores and stuff.

56:05.920 --> 56:06.800
This is how you get it.

56:06.800 --> 56:12.480
So you'll want to head over to theadventurezine.com

56:13.360 --> 56:16.800
and pre-order your copy right away.

56:16.800 --> 56:18.320
So get on board with that.

56:18.320 --> 56:19.760
If you've already done that, thank you so much

56:20.400 --> 56:23.360
from us and from everybody in this area.

56:23.360 --> 56:24.400
We really appreciate your help.

56:25.040 --> 56:27.600
I also want to say because we forgot to mention it

56:27.600 --> 56:28.320
on the last one.

56:30.320 --> 56:31.840
So we did smart stuff.

56:31.840 --> 56:37.520
The Justin and we did it with Justin and Roman Mars.

56:37.520 --> 56:38.560
And that was a joke.

56:38.560 --> 56:44.640
Well, on episode 225 of 99% Invisible,

56:44.640 --> 56:46.640
Roman Mars took it and he ran with it

56:46.640 --> 56:50.400
and he made it funnier than I could ever possibly imagine.

56:50.400 --> 56:53.280
And it was wonderfully flattering that he did that.

56:53.280 --> 56:54.320
And it's so cool.

56:55.280 --> 56:55.920
Go check it out.

56:55.920 --> 56:57.760
And if you haven't listened to 99% Invisible,

56:58.320 --> 56:59.520
what the fuck is wrong with you?

56:59.520 --> 57:00.320
It's so good.

57:00.320 --> 57:01.760
All right, let's run down some stuff.

57:01.760 --> 57:03.840
Uh, thanks to Maximum Fun for having us.

57:03.840 --> 57:06.000
It's a podcast network we're really proud to be a part of.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.120
Go to MaximumFun.org.

57:07.120 --> 57:08.320
You can find a ton of podcasts there

57:08.320 --> 57:09.600
that you will absolutely love,

57:09.600 --> 57:12.800
like The Flophouse and Throwing Shade

57:12.800 --> 57:14.720
and Jordan Jesse Goh and Judge John Hodgman,

57:14.720 --> 57:16.640
all of them at MaximumFun.org.

57:16.640 --> 57:19.120
We're going to be at MaxFunCon East next weekend.

57:19.120 --> 57:21.520
And hopefully we'll see all y'all there.

57:21.520 --> 57:23.440
We're doing a live adventure zone while we're there

57:24.640 --> 57:25.600
that I'm excited for.

57:27.040 --> 57:27.600
Lots of surprises.

57:27.600 --> 57:30.000
I just got a bunch of new costume pieces for it.

57:30.000 --> 57:30.560
Oh boy.

57:30.560 --> 57:31.680
Yeah.

57:31.680 --> 57:33.360
And I got like a real-ass shield.

57:33.360 --> 57:33.760
Nice.

57:33.760 --> 57:35.680
So we do other podcasts that you can listen to

57:35.680 --> 57:37.040
at McElroyShows.com.

57:38.160 --> 57:39.440
I won't go through the list of them,

57:39.440 --> 57:40.480
but we do a ton.

57:40.480 --> 57:41.840
And if you like this show,

57:41.840 --> 57:44.000
then you're going to love one of the other ones we do,

57:44.000 --> 57:45.120
I guarantee it.

57:45.120 --> 57:46.720
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

57:46.720 --> 57:47.600
for the use of our theme song.

57:47.600 --> 57:48.640
It's a departure off the album,

57:48.640 --> 57:49.520
Putting the Days to Bed,

57:49.520 --> 57:51.120
which you should absolutely go listen to.

57:51.760 --> 57:52.800
And then after listening to that,

57:52.800 --> 57:53.920
you're going to want to go

57:53.920 --> 57:57.440
and point your iTunes browser

57:57.440 --> 58:01.600
towards the emotion b-sides from my leash,

58:01.600 --> 58:02.560
Carly Rae Jepsen,

58:03.600 --> 58:06.400
and just sort of emerge yourself

58:06.400 --> 58:08.320
in a sensory deprivation chamber

58:08.320 --> 58:11.040
that somehow does allow the sense of sound

58:11.040 --> 58:11.920
and just-

58:12.480 --> 58:13.040
And love.

58:13.040 --> 58:13.760
The sense of love.

58:13.760 --> 58:14.560
And taste, strangely.

58:14.560 --> 58:16.960
Just fucking let it go.

58:18.080 --> 58:21.440
Just let it all go in that Jepsen tank.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.160
If you're looking for one track,

58:24.160 --> 58:25.280
might I suggest Store.

58:25.280 --> 58:26.720
Oh, Store, guys.

58:26.720 --> 58:27.760
Store.

58:27.760 --> 58:28.800
But Store.

58:28.800 --> 58:30.800
But that Store, though.

58:32.720 --> 58:33.440
You want that final?

58:34.080 --> 58:34.400
Hit me.

58:34.400 --> 58:34.720
Yep.

58:34.720 --> 58:35.600
Here come that final.

58:36.800 --> 58:38.400
This one was sent in by Michael Knoll.

58:38.400 --> 58:38.960
Thank you.

58:38.960 --> 58:41.840
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user Gabriel M,

58:41.840 --> 58:42.640
who asks,

58:44.480 --> 58:47.120
did Happy Gilmore continue professional golfing

58:47.120 --> 58:48.400
after the movie ended?

58:51.200 --> 58:51.920
Oh, no.

58:52.560 --> 58:53.920
My name is Justin McElroy.

58:53.920 --> 58:55.120
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:55.120 --> 58:56.320
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:56.320 --> 58:57.600
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

58:57.600 --> 58:58.640
Kiss your dad.

58:58.640 --> 58:59.680
Square on the lips.

59:16.960 --> 59:18.880

59:36.400 --> 59:38.560
Three friends talk about bad movies

59:38.560 --> 59:41.120
and make each other and you laugh.

To purchase tickets to The Flophouse.

59:58.560 --> 59:59.600
You don't need to do that.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.480
Just download it.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.560

For nudity, I guess.
