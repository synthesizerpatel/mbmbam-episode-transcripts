00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:52.640
Can I smell yo dick? Perhaps not, but I can't smell your queries,

00:53.440 --> 00:57.120
and that's why you've brought them to us. It's my brother, my brother, and me.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.600
Is that really what you're choosing to lead off with?

00:59.600 --> 01:04.000
That's what- that's the beginning thing. The first thing that I'll say is, can I smell your dick?

01:04.000 --> 01:09.840
See, what I'm curious about is that you can smell their questions,

01:10.880 --> 01:13.200
but you can't smell their tangible dick.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.760
Would the question be, may I smell yo dick?

01:17.760 --> 01:19.520
May I smell yo dick?

01:19.520 --> 01:24.480
Can you smell- you certainly can, but am I able to smell yo dick?

01:24.480 --> 01:27.040
You have the olfactory powers to inhale-

01:27.040 --> 01:29.760
Do I possess the capacity for dick smelling?

01:29.760 --> 01:34.880
To waft the dick fumes, and yes, you can smell my dick.

01:34.880 --> 01:37.520
Hi, Nonny. I hope you're listening to this episode.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.800
This is my brother, my brother, but it's an advice show for the modern era.

01:42.800 --> 01:49.040
I am your host, co-host, co-brother, Justin McElroy.

01:49.040 --> 01:52.720
I am also those things, Travis McElroy.

01:52.720 --> 01:58.160
And I'm Griffin McElroy. No titles necessary or required.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.400
So here's how the show works. You guys send us your questions.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.080
We call a few from Yahoo Answers, and then we answer them.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.880
So let's just do it. Let's go right into it.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.520
Let's get it- let's- let's get our dicks wet.

02:09.520 --> 02:13.040
I have a brother that's 12 years older than me.

02:13.040 --> 02:18.080
He's a cool guy, but at times he's a dick, and I can smell him.

02:18.080 --> 02:23.840
For example, a family get-togethers, he likes to play this game where he flips me off when our mother isn't looking.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.800
Awesome! That's a great game.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.320
I wish this question was sent in by your brother instead of you, because he sounds way cooler.

02:31.120 --> 02:35.040
I try to get back at him when I can, but it always seems like he has the upper hand.

02:35.040 --> 02:40.000
Can you please help me out by letting me know how much- letting him know how much of a dick he is?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.280
Thanks, Bitter Brother.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.640
I have bad news for you. Your brother is awesome.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.200
Your brother's- I want to be best friends with him.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.840
That's pretty cool. Yeah, he sounds like a pretty cool cat.

02:52.160 --> 02:55.520
And here's the thing, older brothers are always going to be cooler than you.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.360
That's just how they roll.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.800
And that has as much to do with perception as it does with the classes they have to go to.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.760
And not only that, but like that's their job.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.240
It is your older brother's job to kind of be a dick to you.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.320
Yeah, it makes you tough.

03:08.320 --> 03:08.560
Yeah.

03:08.560 --> 03:11.920
I don't think you guys were ever dicks to me, really.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.120
You wouldn't think that.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.120
We told you you were adopted.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.080
Yeah, but I saw through that ruse pretty quickly.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.320
Yeah, because we had tormented you though.

03:20.320 --> 03:23.040
That's how we made you so hard and crafty.

03:24.080 --> 03:24.320
Yeah.

03:25.120 --> 03:25.920
You know?

03:25.920 --> 03:27.520
Made your heart leathery.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.720
You taught me manners. That's for damn sure.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.360
Yeah.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.840
You would smack me down when I got out of line.

03:33.840 --> 03:34.800
Yeah, absolutely.

03:34.800 --> 03:39.920
Like if you would try to smell inappropriate dicks, we would always say like, stop it.

03:39.920 --> 03:40.720
Get your-

03:40.720 --> 03:41.200
You're sick.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.400
No, you may not.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.200
You're out of line.

03:43.200 --> 03:46.560
And it's may I smell your dick, Griffin.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.040
Jesus.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.000
Grammar.

03:48.000 --> 03:48.800
Cro-magnon.

03:50.640 --> 03:58.000
Your brother sounds cool, but if this is like a play like he got you and so you're going to

03:58.000 --> 04:03.840
redouble back burn him by having us call him a dick, I will say he's a dick.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.120
Your brother's a dick.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.160
What a dick.

04:06.160 --> 04:13.120
Is it wrong to have sex with a woman if she's slightly drunk and I'm fully

04:13.120 --> 04:13.520
sober?

04:13.520 --> 04:14.240
So many ways.

04:14.240 --> 04:18.960
J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J.

04:18.960 --> 04:22.960
You got to like slightly is it specific enough for me?

04:22.960 --> 04:24.880
I wouldn't need like a blood alcohol content.

04:24.880 --> 04:25.200
I don't know.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.720
I'm going to need like-

04:28.240 --> 04:29.680
I keep a breathalyzer by the bed.

04:30.480 --> 04:31.040
Yeah.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.000
At all times.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.400
Because that leads to a nice seg of, you know, blow into this.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.360
Now blow into this.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.240
That's a good move.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.320
Yeah, ladies really love it.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.320
Because they never see that coming.

04:44.320 --> 04:48.880
The important question is if if you're only going to get to have sex with her because

04:48.880 --> 04:51.440
she's drunk, then no, it's not okay.

04:51.440 --> 04:55.680
I think you guys were going to have sex anyways and then she got a little bit drunk.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.080
Then yeah, it's probably okay.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.280
I think, J, you send us this question.

05:01.280 --> 05:07.120
I think you really need to take a long look in the mirror and then you need to decide

05:07.120 --> 05:10.240
if you are, in fact, attractive enough to be having sex with this girl.

05:10.240 --> 05:13.200
Because if not, then no, it's not appropriate.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.920
But if you look at your face in the mirror and you say, all right, J.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.680
This is about your level.

05:18.560 --> 05:22.560
If it's apparent that you have tricked her with juju magic, then you should probably

05:22.560 --> 05:23.680
just keep your dick dry.

05:24.560 --> 05:28.640
You know, juju magic hasn't been the same since it got bought by Anheuser-Busch.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.680
I liked it so much better when it was an independent brew.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.800
But I mean, I don't know.

05:34.800 --> 05:39.840
Because what if- couldn't he just rectify this situation if he's like, oh, I'm dead

05:39.840 --> 05:43.600
sober and she's wicked drunk and there's no way that she would have a sex with me.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.440
So let me just take a couple shots and we're ready.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.720
Thanks, Little John.

05:48.720 --> 05:49.520
It's time to go.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.560
Thanks, LJ.

05:50.560 --> 05:51.840
Or there's the alternate.

05:51.840 --> 05:54.400
Make her take a cold shower and drink some strong coffee.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.720
I want to make love to you.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.480
I'm going to sober you up first.

05:58.480 --> 06:02.240
Balance both of your humors at the same time and then you can fuck.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.080
Although if he's been waiting for our answer, chances are she is sober.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.560
Yeah, sorry about that.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.520
Or I mean, what if it's like somebody that I wouldn't normally have?

06:11.520 --> 06:12.720
What if it's like his girlfriend?

06:14.000 --> 06:17.600
But she's a little drunk and he's not.

06:18.240 --> 06:24.160
But it leads to more adventurous things that she wouldn't typically do if sober.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.040
You know?

06:25.040 --> 06:26.080
Yeah, I eat a bunch of carbs.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.880
She wakes up in the morning like, why is my armpit raw?

06:28.880 --> 06:30.640
He's like, we did the armpits last night.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.720
We finally tried pits.

06:33.440 --> 06:37.040
You've been talking about pits for so long.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.440
The Old Spice is new to us, ironically.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.520
But we tried it and we loved it.

06:41.520 --> 06:42.240
I loved it.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.240
You were just so completely drunk.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.640
I got that pure sport.

06:47.760 --> 06:48.800
Would you like to smell my dick?

06:48.800 --> 06:50.640
Because it smells like pure sport.

06:50.640 --> 06:55.360
Jay, I think that this is one of those cases where you really need to trust your own judgment.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.680
And you seem like a nice guy.

07:00.720 --> 07:05.840
If there's any doubt in your mind, it's like the creepy thing that you talked about.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.680
If you have to wonder if it's creepy, it's creepy.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.080
I think this falls into the same camp.

07:10.080 --> 07:14.160
If you have to wonder if it's kind of skeezy, then yeah, it probably is.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.680
I'm going full prohibitionist.

07:15.680 --> 07:22.640
I'm saying if spirits cross betwixt her lips, just go ahead and just shy away.

07:22.640 --> 07:26.480
See, I actually agree with Griffin on that one.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.720
Because I think that it's just the safer bet.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.600
You don't want to offend anyone in that way.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.400
And you don't want her getting pissed off or doing something wrong.

07:36.400 --> 07:40.480
So just be safe and take her to breakfast the next morning.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.680
And you guys have a chat.

07:41.680 --> 07:42.640
Maybe you'll hit it off.

07:43.200 --> 07:48.960
Now, should he have sex with a woman if he's drunk and she's a giant stuffed animal?

07:51.840 --> 07:54.480
This seems like a pretty pressing inquiry for you, Griffin.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.240
Is this something you need to know like right away?

07:56.240 --> 07:58.720
I need to know two nights ago.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.520
I need to know two nights ago.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.360
Time traveling questions.

08:04.960 --> 08:10.000
So Griffin, maybe you could break me off a Yahoo answer from the Yahoo answer service.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.520
First, I have to thank everybody.

08:11.520 --> 08:14.720
I was a scoundrel this past weekend.

08:14.720 --> 08:19.200
I forgot to solicit these Yahoo answers earlier in the weekend like I usually do.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.720
And instead solicited them 30 minutes before the show started.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.160
But I still got a shit ton.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.280
So thanks, everybody.

08:25.280 --> 08:31.360
And hey, thanks everybody for showing that that is an inexhaustible resource,

08:31.360 --> 08:32.800
apparently, which is fine.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.120
Goddamn, there's so many good ones.

08:35.120 --> 08:35.680
How about this?

08:35.680 --> 08:38.320
This one was sent in by Chris Player.

08:38.320 --> 08:38.960
Thanks, Chris.

08:39.600 --> 08:47.760
It's by Yahoo answers user Goob Von Goob, who asks, how can I seduce my babysitter?

08:49.360 --> 08:50.400
I am 16.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.520
My babysitter is 26 and has been single for a long time.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.680
And it's not particularly intelligent.

08:55.680 --> 08:57.680
Is there a way I can seduce her?

08:57.680 --> 08:58.800
Additional details.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.160
My parents do not trust me.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.680
I don't know about that.

09:03.680 --> 09:05.120
That last part is ominous.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.160
I don't like that.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.520
Because of what I did to the cat.

09:11.680 --> 09:14.080
I mean, everybody has a crush on their babysitter at some point.

09:14.080 --> 09:17.200
16, by the way, maybe a little old for a babysitter.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.840
Maybe you don't need, maybe you shouldn't have a babysitter.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.080
Oh, that's probably why all his parents don't trust him.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.320
A 16 dog?

09:24.320 --> 09:25.520
Hey, dog, you should move out.

09:26.240 --> 09:29.120
You should probably emancipate yourself from that sitch.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.120
Are you a bad person?

09:31.120 --> 09:35.360
Like, are you like that omen kid?

09:35.360 --> 09:38.320
I think the situation is best if he's just direct.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.600
If he just says, hey, you've been single for a long time and you're pretty dumb.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.600
You're probably not going to do any better than a 16 year old kid.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.480
Let's do this.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.880
I think anybody can do better than a 16 year old kid.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.000
And sorry, 16 year old kids that are listening.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.680
But you don't know how to please it.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.480
I'm 23.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.480
I don't know how to please a 26 year old woman.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.960
I certainly didn't know how to seven years ago.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.920
Ain't that the truth.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.920
The women, who knows how to please them at all at any age?

10:06.560 --> 10:08.640
You don't want to get into that when you're 16.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.920
Just be selfish like all the other 16 year olds.

10:11.920 --> 10:16.240
Just worry about your driver's license and what episode of the Jersey Shore is on tonight.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.160
We're being evasive.

10:18.160 --> 10:23.040
How can this guy seduce his beautiful kind babysitter?

10:23.600 --> 10:24.000
Flex.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.200
Flex those beefy, beefy muscles.

10:27.200 --> 10:31.600
Beefy 16 year old muscles.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.240
Pop those tendons right in her grill.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.600
Hey, can you back your grill up a little bit?

10:37.600 --> 10:42.080
I'm about to pop a tendon and I don't want to loosen any of your teeth with my tendon popping.

10:43.840 --> 10:44.400
Oil up.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.600
Like it's a small thing.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.240
Small thing.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.440
Just grease up.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.800
Like if you're going to be-

10:50.800 --> 10:51.760
Like your whole body?

10:51.760 --> 10:53.040
If you're going to have a lady on-

10:53.040 --> 10:53.840
No, that's not-

10:53.840 --> 10:57.520
Okay, you can't grease up your whole body because then you're like creepy red dragon

10:57.520 --> 10:59.520
waiting in the closet to kill her and skin her.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.960
I'm saying like you grease up your top half so you look-

11:02.960 --> 11:11.120
Like you highlight the sinew-y-ness of your 16 year old frame.

11:12.720 --> 11:13.680
That's a good frame.

11:14.240 --> 11:14.720
16?

11:14.720 --> 11:16.400
That's a good frame.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.840
My chassis at 16 was awfully tight.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.360
Yeah, it was a nice-

11:21.360 --> 11:22.400
It was a good chassis.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.480
I'm not commenting on your chassis, but-

11:24.480 --> 11:25.920
No, my chassis was tight.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.920
I'm uncomfortable with this.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.200
I had a good core.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.000
Okay, I'm done.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.800
My delts were-

11:30.800 --> 11:32.240
Well, I'm leaving the call now.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.280
I'm bustling.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.600
I'm quitting the show if you keep up with this.

11:35.600 --> 11:36.720
I can't do it.

11:36.720 --> 11:41.920
I think that you should just be like a super nice tour.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.840
Like, hey, why don't you tell me about your problems?

11:43.840 --> 11:44.560
Ooh.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.800
And then she may associate you as like,

11:47.840 --> 11:49.120
like who's babysitting who?

11:49.120 --> 11:51.360
Ask her to prom.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.280
Okay.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.240
Okay, okay.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.200
Ask her to prom.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.120
Fun, nostalgic.

11:57.120 --> 11:57.920
I love it.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.680
Watch Adventures in Babysitting.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.960
You know that scene in Adventures in Babysitting

12:02.960 --> 12:06.080
when one of the babysitting kids has sex with Elizabeth Shue?

12:06.080 --> 12:07.760
Fast forward to that part and say like,

12:07.760 --> 12:09.280
huh, what do you think?

12:09.280 --> 12:10.720
He has sex with Elizabeth Shue?

12:10.720 --> 12:13.600
Mm-hmm. It's a pretty good movie.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.200
I'm surprised you haven't seen it.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.760
My volume is turned down pretty far on my headphones

12:17.760 --> 12:18.880
so that I don't get feedback.

12:19.440 --> 12:20.720
But I thought you just said something

12:20.720 --> 12:23.760
about having sex with an actual, a literal shoe.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.800
With Elizabeth Shue.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.360
Oh, pardon me, Elizabeth.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.120
I would watch that movie.

12:31.120 --> 12:31.920
I would watch that movie.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.280
May I borrow your shoe for a moment?

12:33.280 --> 12:35.040
Sex with Elizabeth Shue's shoes?

12:35.040 --> 12:36.800
Like, I would be into that.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.720
Why does your dick smell like Elizabeth Shue?

12:38.720 --> 12:41.520
It's leathery.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.840
What is the proper etiquette

12:43.840 --> 12:46.000
when you walk into a public restroom

12:46.000 --> 12:47.840
and there's already someone in there,

12:47.840 --> 12:49.840
but you can't quite tell if the restroom is meant

12:49.840 --> 12:50.960
for more than one person?

12:50.960 --> 12:52.160
Oh, man, Jeff.

12:52.720 --> 12:53.440
That's a good one.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.480
I know what he's talking about, right?

12:54.480 --> 12:58.080
Like you go to one of those halfies where you,

12:59.280 --> 13:01.520
you know, it's sort of like a stall and a urinal,

13:01.520 --> 13:03.360
but it's so small that if you're going to be

13:04.960 --> 13:07.280
doing your business in there, it would be weird.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.600
Yeah, you're going to get splash damage.

13:09.600 --> 13:13.120
I just announced loudly while leaning up against the wall,

13:13.120 --> 13:13.920
no need to rush.

13:13.920 --> 13:14.960
I'm just here for the show.

13:16.160 --> 13:16.560
That's good.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.560
That'll help to really lighten the tension

13:19.600 --> 13:20.080
and not increase it.

13:20.080 --> 13:23.280
The thing is, those bathrooms always have a lock on them.

13:23.280 --> 13:26.000
And if you are the person in the restroom,

13:26.000 --> 13:27.680
you know, the first person to get there,

13:27.680 --> 13:29.600
lock the goddamn door.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.040
What fucking utopia do you operate in

13:33.040 --> 13:35.600
where every bathroom has a security system

13:35.600 --> 13:38.480
that makes them as efficient as a lock on it?

13:38.480 --> 13:40.960
Well, you kind of stretch your leg back

13:40.960 --> 13:43.120
and you put one heel up against the door

13:43.120 --> 13:44.640
or like you stretch your hand

13:44.640 --> 13:47.200
so your hand is like a half inch away from the door.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.360
So if someone tried to walk in, you could slam it.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.840
When I'm peeing, I don't want to fucking pull

13:51.840 --> 13:53.600
some Inspector Gadget hijinks.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.200
Like I want to get the urine out of me

13:55.200 --> 13:57.200
and then get back to whatever it was I was doing.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.760
I think if the door has a lock,

13:59.760 --> 14:05.120
that is a sure sign that it is a one person bathroom.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.040
I think that if you're in a bathroom that has a lock

14:07.040 --> 14:11.120
and you don't lock it, you just want to get dick watched.

14:11.120 --> 14:11.600
That's it.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.040
Like you're just, that's your oops.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.400
Oops.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.120
You saw it.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.800
Sorry, you saw my dick.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.640
Don't you ever tell.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.680
I just want to, in case anyone out there is offended,

14:25.680 --> 14:27.440
that's not my gay guy voice.

14:27.440 --> 14:31.040
That's my Jim Carrey as that bodybuilding lady

14:31.040 --> 14:32.400
from In Living Color voice.

14:32.400 --> 14:38.000
Which is the closest I can approximate to a dick watcher

14:39.120 --> 14:40.480
who likes to be dick watched.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.560
See, mine was very on the nose.

14:42.560 --> 14:45.280
Mine was the gym teacher that just really wants

14:45.280 --> 14:46.640
to get his dick watched.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.560
Yeah, like that's all he wants in this world.

14:48.560 --> 14:49.760
Who's ready for showers?

14:50.640 --> 14:51.280
Me.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.520
I think if you are the person that walks in,

14:53.520 --> 14:57.200
the proper etiquette is to go, whoa, sorry, sorry, sorry.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.280
And then walk to the opposite end of the bar

14:59.280 --> 15:01.360
and blend in with a crowd so that the person

15:01.360 --> 15:02.480
never knows who it was.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.240
They can never know.

15:04.240 --> 15:07.840
I actually carry a small satin pouch

15:07.840 --> 15:11.520
of smoke bombs with me for this very occasion.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.160
Because if I see somebody, if I even like,

15:14.160 --> 15:17.120
if they think for a split second that I've seen their dick,

15:17.680 --> 15:19.360
like smoke bomb out and gone.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.040
Like I'll leave, I'll move away.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.240
I'll move to a different state.

15:22.240 --> 15:22.800
I have a question.

15:22.800 --> 15:27.200
When you guys go to the bathroom and it has a lock on it

15:27.200 --> 15:30.160
and you lock it and there's someone in there, right?

15:30.160 --> 15:32.080
So you can't get in and you try the knob.

15:32.800 --> 15:37.440
Do you do the thing where you try to move away from the door

15:37.440 --> 15:39.200
so it seems like it wasn't you?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.960
Like you try to play like you weren't the one

15:40.960 --> 15:44.240
who just turned the knob and interrupted their beamer.

15:44.240 --> 15:44.800
I actually-

15:44.800 --> 15:46.960
I casually lean against the wall and whistle.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.560
I want them to know.

15:49.120 --> 15:49.920
I want them to know.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.960
Look at my face because this is the face of the guy

15:52.960 --> 15:54.240
whose time you just wasted.

15:54.240 --> 16:01.040
And I have to pee so much more than I did just a few minutes ago.

16:01.040 --> 16:04.160
You've caused me a discomfort and I'll never forgive you for that.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.960
We will never be best friends.

16:06.960 --> 16:07.920
We're never friends.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.520
I can't do it.

16:09.520 --> 16:13.920
I can't let people know that I just was the door guy.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.680
And I don't know like why I'd be embarrassed.

16:15.680 --> 16:16.240
Like they just-

16:16.240 --> 16:18.640
You know, I have the same thing where I always feel discomfort

16:18.640 --> 16:22.160
and I feel the discomfort comes from me knowing they just peed

16:22.160 --> 16:24.880
and then knowing I had to pee and somewhere in there

16:24.880 --> 16:27.840
this knowledge of each other makes us way too intimate.

16:27.840 --> 16:28.960
I'm gonna pee on your pee.

16:31.280 --> 16:32.720
Here, just a second.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.320
Hope you gave it a good flush of Rooney

16:34.320 --> 16:35.760
because I'm about to pee right on it.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.320
Let's make pee cocktails.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.880
My dick's gonna be in the air that your dick was just in

16:38.880 --> 16:40.640
and for some reason it makes me uncomfortable.

16:40.640 --> 16:41.280
I just-

16:41.280 --> 16:42.480
Yeah, no, there's definitely-

16:42.480 --> 16:47.760
There's like a trace of dick that you have behind you in the bathroom.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.640
I hate when somebody pees on the seat while you're waiting

16:50.640 --> 16:51.840
and then they come out

16:51.840 --> 16:54.000
and they look at you like they just ate the last cookie.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.520
Like, meh, I didn't.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.720
They don't flush.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.320
Like, get it?

17:00.320 --> 17:01.680
I peed on the seat.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.200
Enjoy.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.640
Like, what are you doing?

17:04.640 --> 17:05.280
Like, why did you do that?

17:05.280 --> 17:07.120
Why is that guy snively whiplash?

17:07.120 --> 17:08.160
You know, I was asking.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.120
Because he's a villain.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.480
Oh, I see.

17:10.480 --> 17:11.600
Yeah, right, exactly.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.200
I hate when people come out of the bathroom

17:13.200 --> 17:14.960
twisting their handlebar mustache.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.080
And peeing on seats.

17:16.080 --> 17:18.160
Hey, I just peed on the seat.

17:18.160 --> 17:22.640
Can we just everyone be good in bathrooms?

17:23.360 --> 17:25.440
It's not hard to be good at bathrooms.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.440
Just be good at bathrooms.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.040
Get your bathroom game right.

17:29.040 --> 17:32.160
And don't pee on anything.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.680
Just pee in the toilet and wash your fucking hands.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.720
Wash your fucking-

17:36.720 --> 17:37.520
What are you doing?

17:37.520 --> 17:38.240
Get back in there.

17:38.240 --> 17:38.960
Wash your hands.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.320
Now, see, I'm not always agreeing with you on that.

17:42.320 --> 17:42.880
What's worse?

17:42.880 --> 17:43.920
You gotta shake someone's hands.

17:43.920 --> 17:44.560
What's worse?

17:44.560 --> 17:46.640
And you don't know what they've been doing for the past 20 minutes.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.120
What's worse?

17:47.120 --> 17:51.200
There's dry hands that could possibly be germy.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.960
Or wet hands where you think,

17:52.960 --> 17:55.680
oh, I know what you did.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.520
I know what you did and you can't hide from it.

17:57.520 --> 17:58.880
You're saying that-

17:59.760 --> 18:03.600
I would rather someone shake my hand with a dirty, unwashed hand

18:03.600 --> 18:06.960
than a wet hand that I know they washed after they touched their wiener.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.080
Like, I don't need that pressure in my life.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.920
That's so fucked up, Justin.

18:09.920 --> 18:10.480
What?

18:10.480 --> 18:15.760
Because I can guarantee you that that dry hand

18:15.760 --> 18:17.440
has also touched wiener,

18:17.440 --> 18:19.280
only it hasn't taken a bath afterwards.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.240
I don't have to think about it though.

18:20.240 --> 18:22.640
It's not confronting my reality at that moment.

18:22.640 --> 18:23.120
That's-

18:23.120 --> 18:24.320
You live a weird life.

18:24.320 --> 18:28.560
It's pretending you didn't just pee as the opiate of the masses.

18:28.560 --> 18:31.520
I want to be lied to

18:31.520 --> 18:35.440
and I don't want to know the truth about people's bathroom habits.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.120
If I shake your hand and it's wet,

18:37.120 --> 18:38.720
you better have a fucking explanation.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.560
Why didn't you dry it right away?

18:42.560 --> 18:44.160
Dry your hand better next time.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.160
Okay, I just went to the bathroom.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.280
Urine only, so you don't have to think about the-

18:49.280 --> 18:51.040
Oh God, you don't have to think about the alternative.

18:52.480 --> 18:53.200
And then I washed-

18:53.200 --> 18:54.400
We're not even touching that.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.640
I washed thoroughly afterwards

18:56.640 --> 19:00.240
and I sang Old MacDonald while I washed

19:00.240 --> 19:03.360
so that I made sure that I did it for the appropriate length of time.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.200
I used two squirts of soap.

19:06.240 --> 19:11.680
I got front and back because there's a wraparound effect.

19:11.680 --> 19:11.920
Yeah.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.160
Yeah, and that is-

19:14.160 --> 19:17.760
Old MacDonald is also the appropriate amount of time to smell someone's dick.

19:17.760 --> 19:22.400
There's a lot of notes you're going to miss if you're not really in there.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.480
My girlfriend and I have been together for three months

19:28.480 --> 19:30.240
and best friends for five years.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.240
She is a, quote, curvy girl.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.240
It's definitely got her sexy right,

19:34.240 --> 19:36.560
but has a hard time seeing it herself.

19:36.560 --> 19:39.760
How can I help her become more confident and comfortable with her body?

19:39.760 --> 19:43.520
Well, listen, man, if you can crack this one,

19:44.720 --> 19:47.200
you let every guy on Earth know

19:47.200 --> 19:50.960
and you just send that around like an email or like a big kind of chain.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.320
Write a book.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.520
Become a millionaire.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.120
Write a book and get rich, Jay.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.600
Like, will you gonna come to us and have us fix this one?

19:58.320 --> 19:59.440
Okay, done.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.320
Challenge accepted.

20:00.320 --> 20:00.960
We'll fix it.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.520
Like, I can't tell you how.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.680
All I can tell you is that you cannot.

20:05.680 --> 20:05.920
Like-

20:07.120 --> 20:07.680
Wait, wait.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.360
That's the dumbest thing anybody's ever said.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.480
What are you talking about?

20:10.480 --> 20:11.520
You can't tell him how.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.720
You're just gonna tell him that he can't.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.320
Yeah, exactly.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.680
Thanks, drunk, unsupportive dad.

20:19.920 --> 20:20.400
I'm not gonna tell you how-

20:20.400 --> 20:22.000
Now go get me another beer.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.080
I'm not gonna tell you how to please a woman.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.360
I'm gonna tell you that you can't.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.880
You will just fail.

20:28.880 --> 20:29.920
You are a failure.

20:29.920 --> 20:30.640
Okay.

20:30.640 --> 20:33.120
The thing is, is the more that you try, like the-

20:34.800 --> 20:36.080
Okay, here's my advice.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.680
Actions speak louder than words.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.480
And the more you say, no, you're pretty, you're pretty, you're pretty,

20:40.480 --> 20:46.240
the more she's going to shut off to your compliments

20:46.240 --> 20:47.520
because you're gonna start to lose the-

20:47.520 --> 20:48.560
Oh, God, yes.

20:48.560 --> 20:51.200
Your compliments depreciate in value the more you drop them.

20:51.200 --> 20:56.240
So make her feel attractive by being attracted to her, you know?

20:56.240 --> 21:00.240
Like, compliment her when she is dressed up, hug her, kiss her,

21:00.240 --> 21:02.400
do all those things that make a woman feel pretty.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.400
And that's all I got so far.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.360
See, I think-

21:05.360 --> 21:06.720
Let's go back and explore the other thing.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.080
What's your best move?

21:08.080 --> 21:11.200
Explore the fact that if you use too many compliments,

21:11.200 --> 21:13.360
they're completely without value.

21:14.160 --> 21:14.800
That's not a joke.

21:14.800 --> 21:15.360
That's for real.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.680
So what you do is you only compliment her once a year.

21:21.120 --> 21:24.720
You wait, you target it strategically.

21:24.720 --> 21:25.280
Okay.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.360
Like a nuclear strike.

21:27.360 --> 21:31.200
And you wait for it until she's real down in the dumps.

21:31.200 --> 21:36.960
Then you'd say, hey, looking mighty sexy.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.720
How about taking it a little bit further?

21:38.720 --> 21:40.800
Just rays of light will shoot out of her.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.640
Don't speak to her at all except for that one compliment.

21:44.640 --> 21:45.680
I like this.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.240
Move out.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.520
Move out and only visit her.

21:49.520 --> 21:50.240
Have her locked in prison-

21:50.240 --> 21:50.880
Once a year.

21:51.920 --> 21:56.000
In a serious note, if you give her compliments in reaction

21:56.000 --> 21:58.560
to her saying that she looks bad or she's-

21:58.560 --> 21:59.680
Oh, you're fucked.

21:59.680 --> 22:00.720
Oh, no, that's cheating.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.400
She's never gonna buy it.

22:02.960 --> 22:06.800
Try to sympathize without agreeing.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.760
And if you can figure that one out, I will buy your second book.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.120
How to sympathize without agreeing.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.440
How to sympathize without agreeing.

22:15.440 --> 22:16.800
On another serious note-

22:16.800 --> 22:17.680
Men are from Mars.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.600
Another serious note.

22:19.600 --> 22:24.640
You should probably fire a pair of sweatpants to say juicy on them.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.720
It seems so popular.

22:26.720 --> 22:30.320
I was at the grocery store on Valentine's Day,

22:30.320 --> 22:36.320
and I saw a bouquet that had a card and was full of Slim Fast bars

22:36.320 --> 22:38.560
and a balloon that said, happy Valentine's Day.

22:38.560 --> 22:39.120
No, that's-

22:39.120 --> 22:40.560
So don't do that.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.600
Hey, guys?

22:41.600 --> 22:42.320
Hey, guys?

22:43.040 --> 22:44.640
Absolutely don't do that.

22:44.640 --> 22:45.600
Free advice.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.320
Don't do that.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.880
That's inappropriate.

22:48.880 --> 22:51.600
I don't think that's gonna work out for you as good as you think it's gonna.

22:52.960 --> 22:53.440
Griffin.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.600
Yeah, you know what I know what you need.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.440
You know what I need.

22:57.440 --> 22:58.000
That was weird.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.920
Kind of depressed that we didn't work smell your dick into that last question,

23:01.920 --> 23:02.480
but whatever.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.760
This one was sent in by Jonathan Bartram.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.200
Thank you, Johnny B.

23:09.200 --> 23:09.680
Johnny B.

23:10.480 --> 23:13.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Questioner, which is good.

23:14.400 --> 23:14.960
Who asks?

23:16.880 --> 23:21.280
Do you suspect that girls are actually evolved cats?

23:23.120 --> 23:24.000
Oh, yeah.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.400
Yes, every day.

23:26.400 --> 23:30.880
Cats evolving into girls over millions of years of evolution.

23:30.880 --> 23:33.680
Why do girls and cats have uncanny similarities?

23:34.560 --> 23:34.960
Please.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.680
Well, I mean, it's number one, pussy.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.200
Sorry, that was stupid.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.080
Hi, Nani.

23:42.080 --> 23:42.800
Go ahead, Griffin.

23:44.000 --> 23:44.960
That's, I mean, that's it.

23:44.960 --> 23:45.360
That's it.

23:45.360 --> 23:46.720
That's the extent of his question.

23:46.720 --> 23:47.600
They don't have-

23:47.600 --> 23:50.960
He doesn't list the similarities that he's coming up with his crazy brain?

23:50.960 --> 23:51.680
No, but I mean-

23:51.680 --> 23:53.200
They both like milk.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.720
Look, everybody has them, right?

23:55.360 --> 24:02.000
You think of cat, a cat, cat and dog are the two, the binary domesticated animals, right?

24:02.000 --> 24:02.640
Sure.

24:02.640 --> 24:06.240
And so dogs are dudes and cats are ladies.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.000
Okay, cool.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.600
Am I the only person who thinks that?

24:09.600 --> 24:10.320
Am I-

24:10.320 --> 24:11.600
No, no, no, no, no.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.040
We've all thought that before.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.840
Sometimes, and sometimes you look at a cat and you think,

24:15.840 --> 24:18.480
I can kind of see why some guys would think this is attractive.

24:18.480 --> 24:21.520
Like you find yourself attracted to cats by extension.

24:21.520 --> 24:25.200
We've talked about how sexy cats are before just because they want it.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.000
No, they don't.

24:26.000 --> 24:26.720
But they do.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.680
But they don't.

24:27.680 --> 24:30.000
You know that Justin Timberlake song was originally,

24:30.000 --> 24:33.360
I'm bringing sexy cats is what it was originally.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.400
Like he was coming to the party.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.760
He's bringing the sexiest cats.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.640
Justin, we're throwing a really weird sex orgy.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.480
I'll bring some sexy cats.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.440
Yep, yep.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.680
Timberland knows what's up.

24:45.680 --> 24:46.320
He's a dog.

24:46.320 --> 24:50.880
Did you know that Timberland is a dog?

24:51.840 --> 24:54.160
He produces records with a pause.

24:54.160 --> 24:54.800
He's a dog.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.320
It's true.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.600
I can't wait for that Photoshop.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.560
JT bringing sexy cats with his dog.

25:04.560 --> 25:13.920
See, all I can picture him is looking like John Candy in Spaceballs with the big tail on his ears.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.640
JT, that last verse you dropped was so fresh.

25:22.640 --> 25:23.600
I'm going to hump your leg.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.320
Timberland, the dog.

25:26.320 --> 25:31.600
You know what I bet his favorite rap crew he wishes he could join?

25:31.600 --> 25:33.280
Oh no.

25:33.280 --> 25:34.560
The Rough Riders.

25:34.560 --> 25:34.960
Okay.

25:35.680 --> 25:37.040
I was going to say Lil Bow Wow.

25:37.680 --> 25:38.160
Oh, fuck.

25:39.040 --> 25:40.640
Yeah, I was going to say the Dog Pound.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.480
Yeah, there's a lot of dog rappers.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.160
I'll make you a list.

25:46.160 --> 25:48.800
Have you ever noticed how all rappers have evolved from dogs?

25:50.240 --> 25:51.040
That's true too.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.040
I have a question.

25:54.160 --> 25:55.760
Can you give me some answers?

25:55.760 --> 25:58.560
There have to be some answers that have been supplied.

25:58.560 --> 25:58.960
Let's see.

25:58.960 --> 26:03.600
Let's see, that would make men either smelly monkeys, pigs, or dogs.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.320
I think girls got the better end of the deal in that case.

26:06.320 --> 26:06.720
Lol.

26:07.760 --> 26:08.320
Meow.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.240
Meow.

26:12.240 --> 26:12.880
I mean, that's it.

26:12.880 --> 26:16.720
Everybody's just saying that men are pigs or dogs.

26:18.080 --> 26:18.400
Really?

26:18.400 --> 26:19.120
Here's the thing.

26:19.120 --> 26:21.120
These people know that it's not true, right?

26:22.480 --> 26:24.320
Why do they reinforce these people's crazy?

26:24.320 --> 26:32.320
I'm telling you, it's the natural bias of people to give a gender to dogs and cats,

26:32.320 --> 26:34.320
and that cats are female and dogs are male.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.520
No, I understand that.

26:35.520 --> 26:36.640
I have no problem with that.

26:36.640 --> 26:36.960
But what I'm saying is-

26:36.960 --> 26:38.400
I have a problem with it, kind of.

26:39.040 --> 26:39.280
Yeah.

26:39.280 --> 26:44.080
This person who's like, you know that female human beings have evolved from a completely

26:44.080 --> 26:46.800
different species than male human beings have evolved from.

26:47.360 --> 26:48.080
That's the crazy part.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.960
You know that that is scientifically impossible, right?

26:50.960 --> 26:56.880
Like, it's one thing to be like, this gender has similarities to this animal, their attitude,

26:56.880 --> 26:59.680
but it's another to be like, is it possible they've evolved from others?

26:59.680 --> 27:00.160
No.

27:00.160 --> 27:04.160
I need to establish that Griffin knows this, so then we can kind of move on to the question

27:04.160 --> 27:04.960
asker.

27:04.960 --> 27:07.760
Griffin, do you believe that women are evolved from cats?

27:07.760 --> 27:08.320
Answer me.

27:09.200 --> 27:09.440
No.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.040
Do you?

27:12.880 --> 27:13.280
Yes.

27:14.320 --> 27:14.800
See?

27:14.800 --> 27:15.600
I knew it.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.240
I knew it.

27:17.360 --> 27:18.400
You monster.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.480
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

27:20.480 --> 27:21.520
Yeah, you just work.

27:21.520 --> 27:22.720
This is how it starts, you know?

27:22.720 --> 27:25.200
Cats are sexy and ladies are sexy.

27:26.640 --> 27:27.920
You like them both.

27:27.920 --> 27:28.560
Like both.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.720
I'm allergic to women.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.360
Or at least that's been his excuse for all these years.

27:35.360 --> 27:35.920
We don't know.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.000
Don't know what the reality of the situation is.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.360
Women like to poop in gravel, which is weird.

27:44.800 --> 27:45.440
Next question.

27:45.440 --> 27:46.480
I'm kind of a hipster.

27:47.760 --> 27:48.560
Sardines.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.960
Sardines is another one that women love.

27:52.560 --> 27:53.840
Dishes of milk.

27:53.840 --> 27:58.160
I'm kind of a hipster and for a couple of years now I've been sporting a full mustache.

27:58.160 --> 28:00.160
I like it and I think it suits me.

28:00.160 --> 28:05.520
However, I'm also gay and recently a couple of guys I've been interested in have explicitly

28:05.520 --> 28:07.600
torn me down on the basis of my mustache.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.600
I feel a bit conflicted.

28:09.600 --> 28:13.680
If I shave my mustache, I might have a better chance of men, but I'm worried at this point

28:13.680 --> 28:17.840
I'll be sacrificing some part of my personality in order to impress guys who might only be

28:17.840 --> 28:19.840
attracted to me for shallow superficial reasons.

28:19.840 --> 28:23.040
But maybe that's what dating is all about and I'm just being too stuck up.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.440
Frustrated with facial hair.

28:25.440 --> 28:25.680
Bad.

28:26.240 --> 28:26.880
So big.

28:26.880 --> 28:29.920
I'm going to break this story wide open.

28:29.920 --> 28:34.080
If a guy turns you down because you have a mustache, he's not really gay.

28:38.080 --> 28:38.560
Think about it.

28:39.280 --> 28:40.800
Why don't you want a mustache there?

28:40.800 --> 28:43.040
It's so you can pretend you're kissing a lady.

28:43.040 --> 28:44.240
They're fake gay.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.520
They're fomo-sexuals.

28:47.520 --> 28:48.080
Trust me.

28:50.240 --> 28:50.960
How?

28:50.960 --> 28:54.160
No, if you don't want a mustache there, you ain't gay.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.680
Your aim is so true.

28:57.680 --> 28:58.960
I know, I know.

28:58.960 --> 29:02.400
I'm spitting fire here, but it's all straight from the heart.

29:02.400 --> 29:08.160
I can't, I also, I can't wrap my fucking mind around this because who is everybody's favorite

29:08.160 --> 29:08.960
gay of all time?

29:09.920 --> 29:10.960
Charles Nelson Reilly.

29:10.960 --> 29:11.200
Nope.

29:11.760 --> 29:12.400
No?

29:12.400 --> 29:13.280
Really think.

29:13.280 --> 29:13.840
Everybody's.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.960
Tom, oh, well, Neil Patrick Harris.

29:16.960 --> 29:17.920
Everybody's favorite.

29:17.920 --> 29:18.880
Or maybe Tim Gunn.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.200
I have a lot of favorite gays.

29:21.200 --> 29:21.440
I can't.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.960
He doesn't have to be alive.

29:22.960 --> 29:23.280
Okay.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.120
In fact, that's a hint.

29:25.120 --> 29:26.880
He's totes, he's totes dead.

29:26.880 --> 29:27.600
Tom Selleck.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.000
Where are we going with this?

29:30.000 --> 29:30.880
I don't know where you're going.

29:30.880 --> 29:31.360
Hitler?

29:31.360 --> 29:34.000
Like I'm trying to think of mustachioed homosexual men.

29:34.000 --> 29:34.560
Help me out.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.480
Freddie Mercury.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.480
Freddie Mercury is up there.

29:38.480 --> 29:38.800
Yeah.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.960
Wicked big mustache on that dude.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.800
Like quite a, quite a mustache.

29:42.800 --> 29:46.560
He, he, he had a Hagar thing going for him in his later years.

29:46.560 --> 29:47.520
Lots of people don't know.

29:47.520 --> 29:50.160
Freddie Mercury's mustache actually outlived him by three weeks.

29:50.800 --> 29:51.920
That's that's true.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.040
They couldn't bury him.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.080
I'm going to throw out that it's not because of your mustache, but because you refer to

29:56.080 --> 29:57.600
yourself as kind of a hipster.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.640
You think that's the bigger problem than the mustache?

30:01.360 --> 30:01.680
Yes.

30:02.320 --> 30:06.800
I, I think that you need to go after some real gay guys who like a big mouth full of

30:06.800 --> 30:13.280
mustache and like not more of these, no more of these FOMOs. I'm done with them.

30:13.280 --> 30:19.600
Like you, like you need a, a real gay man who likes hair up there.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.480
If you don't like the hair up there, then what are you even doing?

30:22.480 --> 30:23.760
That's such a cool look.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.440
It's such a cool look.

30:26.640 --> 30:27.360
The mustache.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.760
I mean, is it well tended?

30:29.760 --> 30:30.080
Do you have-

30:30.080 --> 30:31.120
Yeah, that's the thing.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.800
Is it above your lip?

30:32.800 --> 30:33.680
Is it above your lip?

30:33.680 --> 30:34.880
Is it below your lips?

30:34.880 --> 30:35.280
What?

30:35.280 --> 30:38.240
Because if you have a mustache on your cheek, that might be part of the problem.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.600
I don't know what you're saying right now.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.200
That's a sideburn, I think.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.000
I don't know.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.360
I don't understand that.

30:43.360 --> 30:45.600
You're talking about like a full on Snidely.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.000
Sure.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.920
You gotta just get the, get a gentlemanly mustache.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.680
Something well groomed.

30:51.680 --> 30:55.040
Not like a, not a Snidely, not a Wombroom.

30:55.040 --> 31:00.640
Just something, something classy and well tended.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.600
Like a topiary on your face.

31:03.600 --> 31:04.640
A face topiary.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.200
Is that, is the ideal situation is a face topiary?

31:07.840 --> 31:11.760
If you're living your life as a mustachioed man, I say you live it.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.360
And don't change for anybody.

31:13.360 --> 31:16.080
If you think that mustache is working for you, fine.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.160
Now, you do raise an interesting point.

31:18.960 --> 31:24.080
I mean, the, one of the main points of your visage is to draw people in.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.080
To attract the people you want to attract.

31:26.080 --> 31:31.040
And if your mustache isn't working that for you, maybe it's not working as well as you think.

31:31.600 --> 31:31.840
But-

31:31.840 --> 31:32.640
He says it suits him.

31:32.640 --> 31:37.360
But hey, if you think it suits you, then you wait until you find the person that loves you

31:37.360 --> 31:39.200
for the mustache that you have.

31:39.200 --> 31:43.360
At the end of the day, your appearance is about attracting other people,

31:43.360 --> 31:44.800
but you should also be happy with it.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.920
And you're, if you're happy with the mustache, then, you know.

31:47.920 --> 31:48.160
Yeah.

31:48.720 --> 31:55.520
My question is, how can I make my roommates stop doing stupid shit without being a bitch about it?

31:56.080 --> 31:58.480
I don't want to get angry with them because they're nice girls.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.360
And I don't want to leave some kind of stupid passive aggressive note.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.120
Love, Jenny Lee from Hawaii.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.360
We have listeners in Hawaii?

32:05.360 --> 32:06.720
Who can get upset down there?

32:08.080 --> 32:10.000
There's an answer in between that.

32:10.000 --> 32:10.320
What's that?

32:10.320 --> 32:14.320
Do you think where you don't have to get angry or leave passive aggressive notes?

32:14.320 --> 32:15.840
You just have to bring it up.

32:17.280 --> 32:17.520
Like-

32:17.520 --> 32:19.600
Yeah, like, um, aloha, roommate.

32:20.160 --> 32:25.360
Um, I don't, that's the only fucking Hawaiian phrase I know.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.720
Um, mukalakehiki, come on, you wanna lay me fast?

32:28.720 --> 32:29.760
Spoil the hollow.

32:29.760 --> 32:32.080
Gungu chichi, gungu chichi, gungu chichi, gungu chichi.

32:32.080 --> 32:38.640
Uh, uh, I had a, I knew a girl in college that had the vest, the best thing for this ever.

32:38.640 --> 32:42.640
She had bags of mini marshmallows, and whenever her roommates would leave,

32:43.360 --> 32:47.760
would leave messes and not clean them up, she would coat the messes in mini marshmallows.

32:49.280 --> 32:50.880
What, what purpose did that serve?

32:50.880 --> 32:52.560
Because then you have to deal with it.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.480
You can't, it's not a regular mess.

32:54.480 --> 32:57.280
Then it's the kind of mess that has mini marshmallows all over it.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.720
That's awesome.

32:58.720 --> 33:01.760
If they left the bathroom sink dirty, mini marshmallows.

33:01.760 --> 33:03.920
And you would know, like, ah, you got me.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.200
I did leave the sink dirty.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.560
Because you can live with some plates here and there,

33:08.560 --> 33:12.000
but what you can't live with are plates with mini marshmallows sitting on them.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.560
Because then people come over and there are so many questions,

33:14.560 --> 33:17.680
and you have to, your, your, your filthiness gets right up in your face.

33:18.640 --> 33:20.640
Why didn't you finish your mini marshmallows?

33:20.640 --> 33:21.520
That's a good question.

33:21.520 --> 33:22.240
I don't know.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.800
How much money was this woman spending on mini marshmallows though?

33:25.680 --> 33:26.640
No price too high.

33:26.640 --> 33:27.040
That's what I'm saying.

33:27.040 --> 33:29.040
I mean, there is.

33:29.040 --> 33:29.360
No?

33:29.360 --> 33:30.640
Well, okay, there probably is, but.

33:31.520 --> 33:32.400
Uh, I, that is such a hard.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.200
They're at 60 bucks a barrel for mini marshmallows now.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.560
I keep them all in my larder.

33:38.560 --> 33:42.240
Uh, I, generally, that's a tough situation cohabitating with people.

33:42.240 --> 33:45.360
Griffin has actually been doing it more recently than, than I have.

33:45.360 --> 33:47.600
How do you guys deal with conflicts, Griffin?

33:48.560 --> 33:50.800
I'm really good friends with my roommates, and we,

33:51.440 --> 33:54.320
if we need somebody to do something, we just do it.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.400
Yeah, honestly, I think it's the kind of thing where the open

33:56.400 --> 33:59.760
communication takes care of the problems.

33:59.760 --> 34:03.440
Like the more open you are to say, Hey, could you do the dishes?

34:03.440 --> 34:05.120
Cause they've been sitting there for a while.

34:05.120 --> 34:08.320
Like if you just don't say anything, it'll fester.

34:08.320 --> 34:10.720
And like, that's why you feel like you either have to be

34:10.720 --> 34:13.600
passive aggressive or angry because those problems are just

34:13.600 --> 34:15.360
like sitting there festering.

34:15.360 --> 34:16.160
Just bring it up.

34:16.160 --> 34:16.880
That is the problem.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.360
If you go, if you go too long without talking about it, then you

34:19.360 --> 34:22.080
start to vilify the roommates in your mind.

34:22.080 --> 34:24.800
And like that has a two pronged effect of one, you don't want to

34:24.800 --> 34:27.040
talk to them and it ruins the relationship.

34:27.040 --> 34:32.720
And two, it makes even things that aren't so bad, seem bad

34:32.720 --> 34:34.960
because you make them part of this bigger pattern that they

34:34.960 --> 34:35.680
won't reverse.

34:36.960 --> 34:40.800
And sometimes, like, I know that when I was in college and,

34:40.800 --> 34:44.640
you know, to present, I'm the type of roommate that when it

34:44.640 --> 34:46.720
comes to cleaning stuff, I just don't see it.

34:46.720 --> 34:47.920
Like it just doesn't occur to me.

34:47.920 --> 34:48.880
It doesn't bother me.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.720
And so it usually takes someone saying, and I've tried to get

34:52.720 --> 34:55.920
better about it, but it usually takes someone saying, hey, by

34:55.920 --> 34:58.400
the way, could you take care of this thing that's been here

34:58.400 --> 34:58.880
for a week?

34:58.880 --> 35:00.880
And I go, oh, yeah, I didn't even think about that.

35:00.880 --> 35:01.440
My bad.

35:01.440 --> 35:04.880
So it might not be that your roommates are being, you know,

35:04.880 --> 35:06.000
messy on purpose.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.440
They might just be messy people.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.800
So let's boil this down.

35:08.800 --> 35:09.120
Okay.

35:09.680 --> 35:13.760
You get one warning and then many marshmallows.

35:13.760 --> 35:14.160
Yeah.

35:14.160 --> 35:15.360
And then many marshmallows.

35:15.360 --> 35:18.000
That seems like a pretty good standard operating procedure.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.360
And they know what that means.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.000
There's no there's no need for ambiguity.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.800
You know, they know they know what that symbol is.

35:24.800 --> 35:27.280
I think everybody understands many marshmallows on your shit

35:27.280 --> 35:28.720
means clean up your shit.

35:28.720 --> 35:29.040
Yeah.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.360
I would also suggest, Jenny Lee, this is just something to

35:31.360 --> 35:34.720
try out if there's a mess that and I'm assuming that's what

35:34.720 --> 35:35.520
you're talking about.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.200
Just clean it up yourself.

35:37.760 --> 35:38.880
It's bothering you so much.

35:39.440 --> 35:40.080
Just clean it up.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.800
And well, see, but that seems and then when your roommate

35:42.800 --> 35:46.320
notice notices what you can't do in that spirit, it can't be

35:46.320 --> 35:49.520
about I did this to teach you a lesson.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.840
It should come from a place of like it was bothering me.

35:51.840 --> 35:55.360
So I cleaned it up like hopefully that kind of good

35:55.360 --> 35:58.320
example will will be a more positive influence in the

35:58.320 --> 35:59.120
roommates than I mean.

35:59.120 --> 36:01.840
What if she's really busy like hanging out on the beach with

36:01.840 --> 36:05.680
Johnny Tsunami or like taking ukulele lessons or applying

36:05.680 --> 36:10.640
banana boat to herself or eating pineapple or spit roasting

36:10.640 --> 36:14.320
a pig or you're doing much better at this than you did at

36:14.320 --> 36:16.240
the the the note gag.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.600
I just wanted to let you know.

36:17.600 --> 36:18.320
Thank you.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.920
You really have a lot more going on here.

36:21.520 --> 36:23.360
Is that racist to Hawaiians?

36:23.360 --> 36:24.240
Can you?

36:24.240 --> 36:25.600
That's not like a thing you can do.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.320
I know they're still American.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.000
Yeah, maybe before they were incorporated.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.200
But what's up?

36:31.200 --> 36:32.640
You can be insensitive, I think.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.320
Oh, well, yeah.

36:34.320 --> 36:37.280
But I love what is our bias?

36:37.280 --> 36:39.200
Our bias is that you live in paradise.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.680
Yeah, you live in heaven on Earth.

36:41.680 --> 36:44.160
Sorry to pay you with such a broad brush, assholes.

36:45.760 --> 36:46.880
I'm going to do a Yahoo.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.560
This one was sent in by Karen D.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.240
Thank you, Karen D.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

36:52.640 --> 36:56.000
Oh, man, I'm so bad about not reading these ahead of time.

36:56.880 --> 37:00.960
Saki Hart, Kio Soma, Dark Mousy and Ronnie V.

37:02.000 --> 37:02.960
That's one name.

37:03.600 --> 37:07.280
I think it's a group of people that have gotten together.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.480
Don't understand how usernames work.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.240
To to just team up.

37:12.240 --> 37:15.040
They form like a Yahoo Answers user super group.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.880
Okay, stupid Voltron.

37:17.840 --> 37:20.240
Yeah, like the damn awful.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.760
Damn Yankees asks.

37:21.760 --> 37:22.260
Yeah.

37:24.080 --> 37:25.520
Which name do you like the best?

37:28.000 --> 37:31.200
I'm trying to name the horses for my story.

37:31.760 --> 37:34.640
I've decided on names for all but one of them.

37:34.640 --> 37:38.880
The horse I haven't decided on is a male silvery gray wild horse.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.120
He's very fast and very strong.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.560
Here are some names I'm considering.

37:42.560 --> 37:52.640
Silver Wish, Phantom Sky, Phantom Dawn, Drifting Castle, Spirit Catcher, Wild Wind.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.760
Which name do you think is the best and do you have any suggestions?

37:55.760 --> 37:56.260
Thanks.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.320
Those are all such great names.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.120
No, they're not.

38:01.120 --> 38:05.360
They're shitty because of all the animals on the planet that you get to name.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.760
Horses are the fucking best.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.200
Horses are the best and you have named them terribly.

38:11.200 --> 38:14.000
What kind of horse names do you like?

38:14.000 --> 38:18.240
You want it to be something a little more like a tougher sort of vibe?

38:18.240 --> 38:18.800
Is that what you're saying?

38:18.800 --> 38:22.560
I want it to be like Papa's Delicate Condition.

38:22.560 --> 38:23.760
Racehorse names?

38:23.760 --> 38:26.320
Like Big Steed maybe is a good one.

38:26.320 --> 38:27.840
No, she's not thinking outside the box.

38:27.840 --> 38:28.400
What about this?

38:28.400 --> 38:28.960
Let me hit you with this.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.320
Princess in the Pants.

38:30.320 --> 38:31.120
Fast Fast.

38:31.760 --> 38:32.080
Sorry?

38:32.080 --> 38:33.040
Fast Fast?

38:33.040 --> 38:34.080
Fast Fast?

38:34.080 --> 38:34.960
Fast Fast.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.560
Justin, have you ever been to a horse race?

38:36.560 --> 38:37.600
Do you not know how they-

38:37.600 --> 38:38.960
I do not know what a horse is.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.960
A Little Sister's Big Shoe.

38:43.520 --> 38:44.640
Tumblin Aloysius.

38:45.520 --> 38:46.720
Little Sister's Big Secret.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.800
Another one that you could do.

38:51.440 --> 38:55.680
I think if you're going to name a horse, it's got to be one word and it can't be a combination

38:55.680 --> 38:59.520
of two kind of gay things to make a super gay thing.

38:59.520 --> 39:04.080
It has to be like Domination.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.240
Domination?

39:06.240 --> 39:06.480
Yes.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.000
Domination.

39:08.000 --> 39:08.640
Domination.

39:08.640 --> 39:09.440
Freedom Suit.

39:12.080 --> 39:13.120
That's good.

39:13.120 --> 39:13.760
What?

39:13.760 --> 39:18.800
I just pictured a horse in a spangly like red, white, and blue suit and it made me really happy.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.760
See, I would read a fantasy novel about horses if they had names like

39:23.760 --> 39:28.560
The Chancellor's Parapet, but we're not working with things like that.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.440
Maybe Justin Timberlake would be a good name for a horse.

39:31.440 --> 39:32.240
Justin Timberhorse?

39:32.240 --> 39:34.560
Yeah, what about just Steven?

39:34.560 --> 39:40.480
Why can't horses have regular adult names like Tim Gunn or Steven?

39:40.480 --> 39:40.960
Trevor.

39:40.960 --> 39:42.960
Neil Patrick Harris.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.480
This is my horse, Freddie Mercury.

39:47.360 --> 39:52.240
He's America's favorite homosexual horse and he's no fun with it.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.920
Check out his sweet horse mustache.

39:53.920 --> 39:55.200
Check out his horse stash.

39:55.200 --> 39:56.960
He's got some oats in there.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.720
He's got a face mane.

40:00.320 --> 40:02.800
A mustache is basically just a face mane.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.120
Silver Phantom.

40:05.120 --> 40:06.240
Silver Striker.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.200
Silver Heart.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.160
Silver Blood.

40:08.160 --> 40:08.880
White Prince.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.560
Moon Lord.

40:10.560 --> 40:11.520
Silver Eye.

40:11.520 --> 40:12.320
Wild Eye.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.280
Magic Orb.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.200
Like, are these the answers that people are giving them?

40:15.200 --> 40:15.840
Yeah.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.400
Did anyone give like a grown-up adult name for a horse?

40:19.200 --> 40:20.080
Silver Pants.

40:20.080 --> 40:25.520
Why not a simple name like Axel, Robbie, Toby, Ryken?

40:27.280 --> 40:27.920
Hey, Robbie.

40:27.920 --> 40:32.720
Robbie, you wanna get fucked up?

40:32.720 --> 40:33.120
Robbie.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.560
When he gets older, he can be Robert.

40:35.120 --> 40:35.840
That's nice.

40:35.840 --> 40:36.800
Robbie, it's Chantam.

40:36.800 --> 40:37.920
I got some steel reserve.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.040
Let's do this.

40:39.040 --> 40:40.640
Robbie, we're gonna go hit up Peckers.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.400
Get some bitches.

40:44.720 --> 40:48.240
Robbie, I thought we were gonna go to Peckers and Timmy fuck some bitches tonight.

40:48.960 --> 40:52.160
No, I don't think that that is how Robbie the horse's friends act.

40:52.160 --> 40:53.280
I don't think that that...

40:53.920 --> 40:55.840
I think Robbie the horse is lonely.

40:55.840 --> 40:58.240
Robbie the horse seems like he lives with his mom still, right?

40:59.760 --> 41:00.240
Robbie.

41:00.880 --> 41:01.920
We have to put Robbie down.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.080
Never moved out.

41:04.080 --> 41:05.280
It's kind of sad.

41:05.280 --> 41:07.040
We have to destroy Robbie.

41:07.600 --> 41:08.560
Axel, though?

41:10.240 --> 41:11.440
You know what I love?

41:11.440 --> 41:11.680
What?

41:12.560 --> 41:14.160
You don't kill a horse.

41:15.200 --> 41:16.160
You destroy it.

41:18.080 --> 41:22.080
The term for putting a horse down, which is like the saddest thing ever.

41:22.080 --> 41:25.840
I'm not making light of that, except I totally am.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.040
You destroy them.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.320
You throw the horse into the fires of Mount Doom.

41:30.960 --> 41:32.480
That's basically what we're saying.

41:33.680 --> 41:37.280
I guess it sounds inhumane to be like, oh, my horse can't walk.

41:37.280 --> 41:41.360
So I just like I totally emptied a clip in his dome.

41:42.240 --> 41:44.400
I popped a bullet in his bubble goose.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.040
You don't do that.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.000
That's not enough.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.200
That's not what he deserves.

41:49.200 --> 41:52.720
He deserves to be destroyed.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.880
Oh, I obliterated that fucking pony.

41:56.960 --> 41:57.520
Hey, Justin.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.040
Me and Robbie went to Peckers last night.

41:59.040 --> 42:00.480
Just got destroyed.

42:01.120 --> 42:03.200
Why are we riding towards Mordor, Justin?

42:03.840 --> 42:08.400
Well, Robbie, Justin, are you going to pitch me into the fires of Mount Doom?

42:09.600 --> 42:10.560
God, this is awkward.

42:11.360 --> 42:12.480
I do need to destroy you.

42:12.480 --> 42:17.680
Like, the more you say it, the more ridiculous it sounds like you're like talking about your

42:17.680 --> 42:22.880
your robot best friend who turned evil, like what they have, like I must destroy him.

42:22.880 --> 42:24.720
The horse shall be no more.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.640
Like there's a button underneath their saddle.

42:26.640 --> 42:28.960
If you push it, it just sends horse meat everywhere.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.520
Like self-destruct button.

42:34.720 --> 42:39.360
I love you, Secretariat, but I'm going to I'm going to fucking give you like you're done.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.040
I'm going to hit you with a rocket launcher, Robbie.

42:41.040 --> 42:41.540
I'm sorry.

42:43.040 --> 42:43.840
You're not fast.

42:43.840 --> 42:45.920
You're not fast enough in the race.

42:45.920 --> 42:47.360
You didn't do a good job in the race.

42:48.080 --> 42:49.920
So where does glue figure into it?

42:49.920 --> 42:50.480
Is that anti-plane?

42:50.480 --> 42:55.600
I don't know, because when I hear destroyed, I fucking destroyed that horse.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.040
I was going to make glue out of that horse.

42:59.040 --> 43:00.080
How did you do this?

43:00.080 --> 43:00.720
Out of this ash.

43:00.720 --> 43:02.400
I was going to invent a way to make glue from a horse.

43:03.200 --> 43:03.760
I don't know.

43:03.760 --> 43:05.440
Ah, horses.

43:05.440 --> 43:09.760
What big fucking stupid animals was like, I broke my leg.

43:09.760 --> 43:11.040
Now I have to be destroyed.

43:13.040 --> 43:14.800
I'm happily engaged.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.480
Twenty five year old stay at home mom.

43:16.480 --> 43:19.120
So every few months I go out to the club with my girls.

43:19.120 --> 43:24.800
I generally just go go to just let loose and go crazy dancing and just have a great time.

43:24.800 --> 43:28.880
But then a creeper will come up and start rubbing his nastiness on me.

43:29.920 --> 43:32.000
How do I originally read this?

43:32.000 --> 43:37.280
Rubbing his nastiness on me, I originally read that as rubbing his sadness on me,

43:37.280 --> 43:38.880
which is probably pretty accurate.

43:39.440 --> 43:40.880
How do I get guts to stop?

43:40.880 --> 43:43.440
Whoa, I think she meant guys, but I want to go with guts.

43:43.440 --> 43:45.120
How do I get guts to stop doing that?

43:45.120 --> 43:48.800
And how do I get them to go dance with my single friends instead?

43:49.440 --> 43:51.520
Stop wearing your sweatpants that say juicy.

43:51.520 --> 43:55.040
Yeah, those are those are like catnip, mannip.

43:55.040 --> 43:55.920
No, not catnip.

43:55.920 --> 43:58.160
I guess dognip because it drives the guys in.

43:58.160 --> 44:06.960
And so technically speaking, you know, exceptionally low voice mustache, all the classic moves.

44:06.960 --> 44:12.000
You really should get the girl if she's interested to start dancing with the guy.

44:12.720 --> 44:17.040
Like if you get your single friend, dance up on him and then you just kind of like in one move,

44:17.040 --> 44:20.160
sort of peel off, then he'll get the message.

44:20.160 --> 44:24.720
I think at least you could roll up a newspaper and pop that dog on the nose.

44:25.280 --> 44:26.320
You bad puppy.

44:26.320 --> 44:27.200
Get out of here.

44:27.200 --> 44:27.760
No.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.760
Some of us are trying to get juicy up in the speeds.

44:29.760 --> 44:32.160
Put some peanut butter on your friend's bottoms, I guess.

44:32.720 --> 44:32.960
Yeah.

44:35.280 --> 44:36.160
You think that would work?

44:37.360 --> 44:39.360
I feel like I have less of an unders-

44:39.360 --> 44:42.720
A lot of episodes we record and I feel like I've talked some things through

44:43.760 --> 44:46.640
and maybe understand the world a little bit better by helping others.

44:46.640 --> 44:53.440
This is one of those episodes where I feel like I understand shit less than I did just 50 short

44:53.440 --> 44:54.160
minutes ago.

44:54.160 --> 45:01.120
Yeah, I mean, dogs are cats literally and people are and horses can be destroyed.

45:02.080 --> 45:03.440
Horses must be destroyed.

45:06.560 --> 45:10.000
Do you think there's one button that interconnects all horses that if you just

45:10.000 --> 45:12.480
flipped it, it'd be like, ah, no.

45:12.480 --> 45:15.200
The horse of President Obama has control over it.

45:15.200 --> 45:15.440
Who?

45:16.240 --> 45:17.040
President Obama.

45:17.600 --> 45:21.840
Obama's got the internet turned off switch and he has to kill all horses button.

45:21.840 --> 45:23.280
Not kill, sorry, sorry.

45:23.280 --> 45:24.640
Destroy.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.160
Destroy.

45:26.160 --> 45:28.800
If you tie the horses together, it's basically WMD.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.000
A winning of mass destruction.

45:32.640 --> 45:34.400
How are we supposed to answer this fucking question, though?

45:34.400 --> 45:37.680
Because I don't think the three of us have ever been the type of person.

45:37.680 --> 45:42.640
I don't know that I know any of the type of dudes who go up to girls behind

45:43.840 --> 45:45.600
at bars and like dance on them.

45:45.600 --> 45:47.200
Like, aren't those guys like-

45:48.160 --> 45:48.800
Baiting someone.

45:48.800 --> 45:52.640
100% creepers except you get like 1% like Patrick Dempsey's.

45:52.640 --> 45:54.240
Like Patrick Dempsey's a miracle.

45:54.880 --> 45:57.120
You don't want to pass them off on your friends.

45:57.920 --> 46:01.040
I would say if one starts dancing with you, you just kind of just

46:01.040 --> 46:03.280
ignore them and eventually look away.

46:03.280 --> 46:08.240
Isn't that why you go to clubs like big groups of girls together so they can like

46:08.240 --> 46:10.640
form ranks like a pride of lions.

46:11.280 --> 46:14.720
They just all get together to protect each other from the creepers.

46:14.720 --> 46:17.280
Make a phalanx and shatter him.

46:17.280 --> 46:21.680
I tried to dance on some girls at a bar once, but

46:21.680 --> 46:24.640
but they had a really tight nickel package that just-

46:26.480 --> 46:29.440
Their 4-3 was just too much where you could handle it.

46:29.440 --> 46:32.800
God damn, I hope that's a defensive maneuver, not an offensive one.

46:32.800 --> 46:35.120
Two sports gags in a row.

46:35.120 --> 46:36.080
One of them I worked.

46:36.080 --> 46:39.840
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but real quick housekeeping stuff.

46:41.680 --> 46:45.280
Of course, the Maximum Fun Network has the Pledge Drive coming up.

46:45.280 --> 46:49.760
We're going to have some really cool things to give away to people who help support us

46:49.760 --> 46:52.640
and all the other great max fun shows, so keep an eye out for that.

46:52.640 --> 46:53.680
It starts next Monday.

46:54.480 --> 46:55.120
Next Monday.

46:55.120 --> 46:57.840
So get your hearts, your minds, and your wallets ready.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.600
Because it's going to be big.

46:59.600 --> 47:00.400
You're going to want to give.

47:00.400 --> 47:01.120
It's going to be special.

47:01.760 --> 47:02.880
Listening parties.

47:02.880 --> 47:06.880
If you get four or more people together to listen to the show,

47:06.880 --> 47:08.160

47:12.400 --> 47:16.240
and we will record you a personal message to begin your party.

47:16.240 --> 47:21.120
You get one for your first party and then for every 10 after that.

47:21.120 --> 47:24.240
Jeff Monloch, just hit number fucking 20.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.520
Have we even done 20 episodes of this stupid show?

47:28.240 --> 47:28.960
I don't think so.

47:28.960 --> 47:30.160
I don't know how he's been doing it.

47:30.160 --> 47:30.880
He's rigged.

47:30.880 --> 47:31.600
Rigged the thing.

47:31.600 --> 47:35.760

Jordan and Jesse Go, Sound of Young America.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.600
Stop podcasting yourself.

47:55.600 --> 47:56.000
Yeah.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.720
It's a very special Jordan and Jesse Go this week.

47:58.720 --> 47:58.960
Yeah.

47:59.520 --> 47:59.920
Yeah.

47:59.920 --> 48:02.240
And our congratulations on that.

48:02.240 --> 48:03.840
Travis is also pregnant.

48:03.840 --> 48:05.280
Travis is pregnant.

48:05.280 --> 48:05.760
Yay.

48:05.760 --> 48:06.800
Wow, super pregnant.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.080
With our joke baby.

Well, I can't promise to draw you to.

48:34.960 --> 48:36.880
What if they sell like hatred or something?

48:36.880 --> 48:41.120
It'll draw me to you in like a sexy, like a sexy way.

48:54.320 --> 48:55.600
We have a voicemail line.

48:56.320 --> 48:58.560
Two zero three mbnbam one.

48:59.120 --> 48:59.680
Yeah.

48:59.680 --> 49:04.800
You can follow us on Twitter and we always encourage people to tweet about the show.

49:04.800 --> 49:06.880
Hashtag mbnbam.

49:10.400 --> 49:17.280
Of course, we have people who are always out there spreading the good word about mbnbam.

49:17.280 --> 49:22.160
And honestly, without those people, we would not have a show.

49:23.520 --> 49:28.880
I think special, special thanks has to go to Osman Mariko, who.

49:28.880 --> 49:29.600
Oh, my God.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.440
Like every tweet that dude does.

49:31.440 --> 49:32.080
It's about us.

49:32.080 --> 49:34.560
And like, does that make your Twitter feed better?

49:34.560 --> 49:35.360
Yeah, I think so.

49:36.000 --> 49:36.960
Yeah, probably.

49:37.920 --> 49:43.360
So I also like Michelle Mittens and she basically summed up our show in about 20 words.

49:44.640 --> 49:45.040
You know what?

49:45.040 --> 49:47.600
I think she was retweeting Osman Mariko there.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.440
So they're blowing it up.

49:49.440 --> 49:50.080
There you go.

49:50.080 --> 49:50.480
Blowing up.

49:50.480 --> 49:55.840
But thank you to everybody so much for all the tweets and everything.

49:55.840 --> 49:56.960
We really do appreciate it.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.800
But anyway, that's all for our nonsense.

50:01.600 --> 50:01.920
Griffin.

50:01.920 --> 50:02.640
That was really fast.

50:02.640 --> 50:06.640
Well, I'm trying to do it better because I don't want people to think we sold out.

50:06.640 --> 50:09.200
Should we talk about that new podcast?

50:10.400 --> 50:10.880
Which one?

50:12.320 --> 50:14.560
Nerdist has a new podcast.

50:14.560 --> 50:15.520
I don't want to give.

50:15.520 --> 50:16.720
I don't want to give those Ham and Eggers.

50:16.720 --> 50:17.680
No credibility.

50:17.680 --> 50:18.480
Ham and Eggers.

50:18.480 --> 50:20.960
Apparently Nerdist has a new podcast where people send them questions.

50:20.960 --> 50:22.240
How great idea, guys.

50:22.960 --> 50:24.080
Where'd you come up with it?

50:24.080 --> 50:26.000
Questions and answers?

50:26.000 --> 50:26.880
I've never met him.

50:27.600 --> 50:29.760
I feel like he's creeping on my style.

50:29.760 --> 50:30.880
Maybe just a little.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.400
He's just chomping your flavor.

50:32.400 --> 50:33.680
He's chomping my flavor.

50:33.680 --> 50:37.680
I know he has like a billion Twitter followers and he's actually a super nice and funny guy.

50:38.400 --> 50:40.720
But quit creeping, Chris Hardwick.

50:40.720 --> 50:42.080
Tell him we got beef, everybody.

50:42.080 --> 50:44.000
Go to Twitter and tell him.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.920
Just when we squashed that stop podcasting yourself beef, we got a new flavor.

50:47.920 --> 50:50.160
Basically the one we created for ourselves.

50:50.160 --> 50:51.760
We squashed it in like a week.

50:51.760 --> 50:55.040
And then Nerdist has to swoop up and beef it.

50:55.040 --> 50:56.400
Try and cop our swagger.

50:56.400 --> 50:57.680
I say no, Chris Hardwick.

50:58.320 --> 50:59.840
This far, no farther.

50:59.840 --> 51:02.000
Griffin, give me what I need.

51:02.480 --> 51:05.760
This very final question was sent in by Craig Neiman.

51:05.760 --> 51:06.880
Yep, that's it.

51:06.880 --> 51:07.440
Got it.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.480
Take a try.

51:09.040 --> 51:10.240
Thanks, Craig Neiman.

51:10.240 --> 51:12.800
It's by Yahoo Answers user MK who asks,

51:12.800 --> 51:20.080
is it a good idea to use a sex doll as a martial arts striking and grappling dummy?

51:20.080 --> 51:25.360
I'm Justin McElroy.

51:25.360 --> 51:26.560
I'm Travis McElroy.

51:26.560 --> 51:27.760
I'm Griffin McElroy.

51:27.760 --> 51:29.760
This has been my brother, my brother, my brother.

51:29.760 --> 51:32.320
And me, this is your dad, school wear on the lips.
