00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.600
Welcome to our new friends, welcome to old friends.

00:48.880 --> 00:53.200
You've made it once again to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern

00:53.200 --> 00:59.280
era. I am your host Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

00:59.280 --> 01:06.320
And this is a new era. It's a bold new day, as you heard from our theme music. This is familiar.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.800
It's not too familiar, but it will still be pretty much the same. So it's not exactly like

01:12.800 --> 01:16.640
the song, but you get the message. It's nothing like the song. It's a good song.

01:16.640 --> 01:21.520
It's a good song. It's a good ass song. Long mentors gave us permission because we are now

01:21.520 --> 01:27.120
fancy, fancy gentlemen. Now, what could have prompted a move like this? Is it the worry

01:27.120 --> 01:33.520
of lawsuits from an extremely powerful and rich musical group like ABBA?

01:33.520 --> 01:39.920
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. That's 99% of it is my fear of death in prison.

01:39.920 --> 01:44.640
You think we will die in prison because we don't have the rights to use that song. And here's the

01:44.640 --> 01:52.240
weird thing. ABBA not so good by returning our phone calls. We try our best, but no dice. But

01:52.240 --> 01:58.960
but but we do want to signify a change because we have it's kind of a big deal today. It's it's

01:58.960 --> 02:05.280
exciting news. If this is the first place you're hearing about it, it is. It is still pretty

02:05.280 --> 02:12.560
exciting, even if you already know my brother, my brother, me. Has joined. With the maximum fun

02:12.560 --> 02:20.640
network Voltron, like we we are the left foot of the maximum fun robot, right?

02:20.640 --> 02:25.600
Could we also be like Megazord? I mean, does it have to be Voltron or can we go into like

02:25.600 --> 02:27.920
Mighty Morphin Power? I'm more comfortable with Mighty Morphin Power.

02:27.920 --> 02:32.160
Ideally, we would be like Dragonzord and we could be like our whole other mech,

02:32.160 --> 02:36.560
but I don't think I'm not going down this road with you guys. There are new people listening.

02:36.560 --> 02:40.800
I don't know. I'm just saying we pull out our magic green ranger flute and we summon the

02:40.800 --> 02:45.600
Dragonzord. I don't have to make a big deal out of it. I can't do this with you. I can't do it.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.720
Oh, you're thinking more of like a white saber, too. Like the Red Ranger.

02:48.720 --> 02:51.680
Not one word. I'll quit. I swear to Jesus.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.920
No, this is an advice show for the modern era.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.560
And a Power Rangers fan cast.

02:58.560 --> 03:04.480
And a Power Rangers fan cast. We used to do VR Troopers, too, but that one ran dry.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.960
If we get into Beatleborgs, I quit.

03:06.960 --> 03:11.520
We had a brief big bad Beatleborgs phase, but we grew out of that pretty quickly.

03:11.520 --> 03:15.280
Now it's pretty much just advice and Power Rangers and tattooed teenage

03:15.280 --> 03:16.560
alien fighters from Beverly Hills.

03:16.560 --> 03:20.960
It's the same for our pizza cats. We're all about that shit.

03:21.520 --> 03:24.880
But no, this is an advice show. We take your questions and questions from

03:25.600 --> 03:32.400
various sources throughout time and space, and we transform them alchemy-like into wisdom.

03:33.200 --> 03:40.560
So I know that if you're new to the show, or old friends, then you've probably got a lot of

03:40.560 --> 03:45.680
questions and we will deal with those at the end of the show and try to address those.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.080
And of course, we welcome you to get in contact with us.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.760
But practical upside is, it's all good stuff.

03:52.160 --> 03:56.320
It's a really exciting thing for us personally,

03:56.320 --> 03:58.640
but it's not going to represent a big change to the show.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.560
It's still going to be the same thing, pretty much.

04:02.560 --> 04:06.720
I said, we are contractually obligated to stop talking about Power Rangers.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.520
It was like the first thing that they said.

04:09.520 --> 04:14.160
I don't know what it is. It's just that the Max Fun Network and Bandai have just this

04:14.160 --> 04:18.000
long-standing grudge. I can't even recall where it started, but-

04:18.000 --> 04:22.080
Rancorous is how I discuss the relationship. It's rancorous. It's full of rancor.

04:23.440 --> 04:27.680
Max Fun also wanted us to change the name of the show to Chuckle Fraternity, but we

04:29.600 --> 04:31.920
shot them down on that. So we're already taking-

04:31.920 --> 04:35.760
We are replacing Travis, but that is sacrifices, you know what I mean?

04:37.280 --> 04:43.760
We're currently at the point where Jesse Thorne standing in for Tom Hanks would

04:43.760 --> 04:47.680
tell us to change our name from the Oneaters to the Wonders.

04:49.680 --> 04:50.960
You know what? I've had a good run.

04:52.240 --> 04:52.800
Yeah.

04:52.800 --> 04:58.320
I mean, you served a very important purpose on this show as Gilbert Godfrey's placeholder.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.080
Spoiler alert, that is who we're replacing with.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.800
We've gotten a lot of notes on the show,

05:04.800 --> 05:09.680
and most of them have to do with that it's just not grating enough to the ears.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.320
Sonically, it's too pleasing.

05:12.320 --> 05:19.280
They want it to be sonically unpleasing. So we're just going to get Gilbert Godfrey on

05:19.280 --> 05:23.680
One Week We Might Have Tom Waits. Just people who are just generally unpleasant to listen to.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.040
Snooki, making sure to tune in.

05:29.280 --> 05:34.400
In fact, one episode, just no McElroys at all. Just Snooki, Tom Waits, and Gilbert Godfrey.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.440
God, listen to that show.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.640
God, it's wonderful.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.120
We got a Yahoo answer from-

05:39.120 --> 05:39.920
That's my Tom Waits.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.120
How it is? That's good. That's very good. All right.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.040
To be fair, that's also your Tom Hanks.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.600
Pussy footin' around. Let's get into the wisdom, into the knowledge, and let's open it up.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.760
This comes to us from FormSpring.

05:55.760 --> 05:59.840
Hey, MBMBAM, I have a problem falling asleep every night.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.960
If I go to bed at 10, I end up falling asleep around one or two,

06:03.600 --> 06:08.640
and I usually have to get up early, meaning I only get, at most, five hours of sleep every day.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.320
What do you guys do to fall asleep faster?

06:10.320 --> 06:14.160
Yeah, this is our high-energy, maximum-

06:14.160 --> 06:16.560
This is our high-energy opening, Travis.

06:16.560 --> 06:17.600
How do you fall asleep?

06:18.160 --> 06:20.400
Well, everyone sleeps.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.720
Give me something that we want to appeal to everybody.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.800
If you did this intentionally, you're a genius.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.920
If it's an accident, you're a dumb-

06:29.920 --> 06:31.120
Guys, falling asleep.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.920
So far, I would say just listen to this particular episode of our podcast.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.560
Step one.

06:39.360 --> 06:39.760
Welcome.

06:40.720 --> 06:41.520
Well, okay.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.880
First, jerky.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.400
Just jerking so right.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.240
I feel like we're on a first date right now.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.120
I feel like we're on a first date with somebody that we met on the internet,

06:55.120 --> 06:58.720
and, like, I don't know, everything we say, like, you're gonna just assume-

06:58.720 --> 06:59.840
The first words out of your mouth?

06:59.840 --> 07:01.440
That's just what we're all about.

07:01.440 --> 07:04.240
You sit down at the table, it's like, hi, I'm Paul, jerking it.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.240
What?

07:06.800 --> 07:09.360
That's a weird intro, Paul, but let's go with it.

07:09.360 --> 07:14.080
I think if you are still on board by the end of the episode, then we've got you for life.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.400
If you've already tuned away, it probably wasn't meant to be.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.640
Let me go ahead and change course here and give some advice.

07:22.000 --> 07:22.400
Oh, no.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.760
No, first and foremost, what's important is to change your habits before going to bed.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.520
Do not read in bed.

07:29.520 --> 07:30.880
Do not watch TV in bed.

07:31.520 --> 07:32.880
The bed is a place for sleeping.

07:32.880 --> 07:36.240
If you train your mind to getting used to doing other things in bed,

07:36.240 --> 07:37.920
it'll be harder to fall asleep.

07:37.920 --> 07:38.560
Wait, nothing?

07:39.760 --> 07:40.480
Well, you jerk it.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.760
That's not it at all.

07:41.760 --> 07:42.560
That's not, like, a good-

07:42.560 --> 07:44.400
That's actually really wicked bad advice.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.920
That's, like, bad advice.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.320
That's what any sleep therapist will tell you.

07:48.320 --> 07:52.000
That your bed is a sleep temple that you can't do anything else in?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.480
Well, sleep therapists tell you to have sex in the kitchen?

07:54.480 --> 07:55.600
Like, is that what you're saying to me?

07:55.600 --> 07:58.560
No, I'm saying when you're getting ready for bed, not for the sexy time,

07:58.560 --> 08:01.120
but when you're getting ready for bed, get ready for bed.

08:01.120 --> 08:04.480
Don't, you know, go to bed and then play video games for an hour.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.000
Don't watch TV.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.600
You know, you can sex it up in there.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.920
But, you know, when you're going to sleep-

08:09.920 --> 08:10.720
Just don't make that noise.

08:10.720 --> 08:11.680
Just go to sleep.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.120
Do not make that noise while you do it.

08:14.000 --> 08:14.800
So wait, wait, wait.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.080
Let me get this straight, Travis.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.840
What you're saying, and you're claiming to be backed up by medical science.

08:19.840 --> 08:20.560
Yes, yes I am.

08:20.560 --> 08:25.120
That when you get into bed, you should lie perfectly still and just wait.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.080
Is that what you're saying to me?

08:26.080 --> 08:28.400
Travis, did Travis learn how to sleep in prison?

08:28.400 --> 08:29.280
Because that's what it said.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.280
I'm not screaming to stop.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.240
You should just go to sleep.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.360
I can't, I don't have a switch like that.

08:35.360 --> 08:39.200
I have to fucking trick my body into not being conscious anymore.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.000
My body wants to be awake so much.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.120
But you also drink like bottles and bottles of NyQuil every night.

08:43.680 --> 08:46.240
No, no, cause that's a slippery slope.

08:46.800 --> 08:47.760
Get down that road.

08:48.480 --> 08:53.840
Like my body knows that when I'm asleep, I'm basically dead for like eight hours.

08:53.840 --> 08:54.080
Sure.

08:54.720 --> 08:58.000
And that's, you know, not only terrifying, but wasteful.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.640
There's a lot of things I could be doing with my dead time.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.120
So yeah, I have to like trick it.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.560
I have to like, I have to like sit on my legs for a while until my legs fall asleep.

09:06.560 --> 09:09.600
And the rest of my body is like, yeah, might as well just go for it.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.280
You think about the world we live in today.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.720
It's 2011.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.520
At any moment I could press a button and have any

09:19.920 --> 09:25.920
television program or book read to me by the author or movie or anything at my finger.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.360
How am I supposed to sleep through that?

09:27.360 --> 09:32.560
Like think about all the amazing things I have at my disposal.

09:32.560 --> 09:35.440
How can I convince myself that sleeping would be better than that?

09:36.160 --> 09:37.440
Oh, so we're going the opposite way.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.960
We're just telling him to like, forget it.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.480
Forget sleep.

09:41.680 --> 09:45.040
Make do with that five hours and maybe do something with your life.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.280
Have you guys ever tried to drink warm milk?

09:47.280 --> 09:48.240
It's foul.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.360
It's fucking gross.

09:49.360 --> 09:54.160
You have to like, first of all, you got to chortle down that skin that forms on the top.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.840
Like you have to break the, the what's that thing called?

09:58.640 --> 10:02.240
The seal, the Muffet, the Muffet.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.800
Yeah, it's called the Muffet.

10:04.800 --> 10:05.040
Yeah.

10:05.040 --> 10:05.920
You got to break the Muffet.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.200
Um, yeah.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.920
And that's, that's not a pleasant, that's not a pleasant taste at all.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.920
And everybody knows that's where the sleeping is.

10:11.920 --> 10:18.320
You got to drink the skin or if you don't drink the Muffet, if you don't drink the Muffet,

10:18.320 --> 10:19.120
you'll be up for hours.

10:19.120 --> 10:22.080
Can you buy, can you buy piecemeal Muffet?

10:22.080 --> 10:22.400
Yeah.

10:22.400 --> 10:22.560
Yeah.

10:22.560 --> 10:23.440
They're dehydrated.

10:23.440 --> 10:27.520
But really the only place I've ever seen it though is at Cracker Barrel.

10:27.520 --> 10:28.400
Yeah, they do.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.560
You know, it's like in the old timey paper wrapping and you're going to

10:30.560 --> 10:31.040
Sure, sure.

10:31.040 --> 10:35.440
You place some checkers, um, you, you eat some liquor sticks and then you

10:35.440 --> 10:39.120
The great, the great irony is of course that anybody would ever eat at Cracker Barrel and

10:39.120 --> 10:40.800
not want to sleep instantly.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.360
That's like you need it.

10:43.360 --> 10:49.600
Um, but, uh, so, so eat your Muffets, go to Cracker Barrel and never read in bed.

10:50.480 --> 10:51.760
I think it's a pretty good takeaway.

10:51.760 --> 10:56.720
Um, I've been happily married for three years, but I've been noticing something that I no

10:56.720 --> 10:58.160
longer think is a coincidence.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.240
I've been getting a lot more attention from ladies ever since I got married.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.280
I was never a real lady killer in the first place.

11:05.280 --> 11:05.840
That's good.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.280
But I did all right since I've been married.

11:09.280 --> 11:14.560
However, I've gotten flirted with much, much more than I ever did when I was single.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.400
What's up with that?

11:16.400 --> 11:16.720
Mike.

11:17.360 --> 11:20.240
So Mike is Mike's now killing, killing ladies.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.040
Yeah.

11:21.040 --> 11:28.640
That's really cool because, um, as a chronically single male, uh, that's like the one thing

11:28.640 --> 11:29.360
that I have.

11:29.360 --> 11:33.200
That's like the one leg up is that like I have the opportunity to do that if I wanted

11:33.200 --> 11:36.480
to, but I don't and you do and you can't use it.

11:36.480 --> 11:41.920
So that's cool that you're just so, you just have this embarrassment of lady attention.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.760
That's, I'm really happy for you, Mike.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.720
Griffin, have you, have you considered putting a ring on it?

11:46.720 --> 11:51.360
Um, that's some, that's like that Adam, the Adam Sandler is making a movie about that

11:51.360 --> 11:57.280
and I try to live my life avoiding any phony baloney Adam Sandler movie scenarios.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.000
Except for the time that I sold you that magical remote control.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.640
There was that.

12:00.640 --> 12:04.160
And I did, I did go back to elementary school at the age of like 25.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.600
So, um, yeah.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.480
No, I'm really worried during that time period, by the way.

12:09.120 --> 12:09.360
Yeah.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.080
And that was the only, that was only to recruit for your jump rope team.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.880
So I don't think that it's not the same thing.

12:14.880 --> 12:20.640
Well, I here's, here's my thinking on this is that it's not that I would like to believe

12:20.640 --> 12:25.600
enough in humanity that it's not that every woman is attract instantly attracted to a

12:25.600 --> 12:27.600
guy because he is married.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.240
But I think it's more that you become more comfortable.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.400
You're not trying to impress anyone.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.000
I mean, you've already got, you know, your significant other, so you're not working at

12:36.000 --> 12:38.880
it, which instantly makes you more attractive.

12:38.880 --> 12:39.840
So true.

12:39.840 --> 12:40.400
That's it.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.280
A hundred percent.

12:41.280 --> 12:45.120
If every single guy listening to the show can take away one thing, it is if you just

12:45.120 --> 12:49.520
relax and stop working, it makes you so much cooler.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.600
Like women will like you so much more if you're not trying to impress them.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.640
Brain married.

12:54.640 --> 12:55.440
That's what I call it.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.480
You gotta be brain married.

12:56.480 --> 12:56.960
I like that.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.000
I like that a lot.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.640
How deep, how deep does that, that inception go though?

13:00.640 --> 13:06.160
Like, I mean, I need to obviously a name for my brain wife, right?

13:06.160 --> 13:11.040
I would need a name and like a story of how we met, how I met my, how I met my wife.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.080
How I met your brain mother.

13:13.760 --> 13:19.200
I'm saying I can, I can invent an entire scenario around a person and then not let anybody know

13:19.200 --> 13:20.080
about it except for me.

13:21.200 --> 13:21.920
I can do that.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.520
Like I've played Dungeons and Dragons.

13:23.520 --> 13:28.160
I'm totally capable of suspending entire, you know, worlds in my mind's eye.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.760
Those two skills dovetail so nicely.

13:33.120 --> 13:37.520
Because I know that when I'm trying to stop impressing women, the first thing I do is

13:37.520 --> 13:38.880
talk about Dungeons and Dragons.

13:39.520 --> 13:39.760
Hi.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.200
And that, and you know what?

13:41.200 --> 13:44.320
A lot of people try to keep this, their brain wife secret.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.840
I say, yeah, open with it.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.480
I say, hi, my name is Griffin.

13:48.480 --> 13:52.400
I have an imaginary wife and a great skill at playing Dungeons and Dragons.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.520
Would you like to dance with me?

13:55.520 --> 13:56.480
And you know something?

13:58.320 --> 14:00.400
My favorite December's album is The Brain Wife.

14:00.400 --> 14:05.840
So I just wanted to, I thought I'd kill that conversation.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.280
Thanks, Griffin.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.080
Yeah, you did it.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.120
Mission accomplished.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.560
You guys want to hear a Yahoo?

14:10.560 --> 14:11.520
I would love to.

14:11.520 --> 14:12.400
Yahoo Answers.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.320
Can you tell us about those, Griffin?

14:14.320 --> 14:19.120
Yahoo Answers are, they come from a website that is also called Yahoo Answers, and they

14:19.120 --> 14:21.280
are written by the dregs of humanity.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.960
And we take them and we make fun of the people who ask them.

14:24.960 --> 14:25.600
That's not true.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.400
We help them.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.800
Griffin, don't break the solution for me.

14:28.800 --> 14:33.920
I do believe that everybody who asks a Yahoo answer question is beyond help from anybody.

14:34.960 --> 14:35.600
Okay, do it.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.880
This one was sent in by Matty B.

14:38.880 --> 14:39.840
Thank you, Matty B.

14:39.840 --> 14:44.880
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Jessica, who asks, help with my own urban legend?

14:47.200 --> 14:50.400
In my English class, we're having this huge project on urban legends.

14:50.400 --> 14:54.160
My job is to create my own urban legend, but I'm having trouble making a good plot.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.120
I need suggestions.

14:55.680 --> 15:02.160
I can write romance, horror, suspense, supernatural, par, et cetera.

15:02.160 --> 15:03.120
Wait, what?

15:03.120 --> 15:06.080
I don't, maybe golf, golf themed urban legends.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.440
I don't understand.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.120
So I would prefer one of these topics in it.

15:10.080 --> 15:13.840
I know there are non scary urban legends out there, but I like creepy.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.400
It can possibly happen to you stories.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.280
Does she, does this urban legend have to be about her?

15:22.080 --> 15:24.320
I don't know if it has to be about her or her.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.720
What is the name of this emailer, this asker?

15:27.280 --> 15:30.640
Jessica, which is nearly impossible to make.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.920
She must, she must have been early on the Yahoo answer stream.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.680
She was able to get Jessica as her username.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.200
Oh, that's a pretty sweet username.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.320
I hear people are just selling those off now for like six figures.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.040
It's pretty cherry.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.840
Jessica, the legend of Jessica.

15:44.960 --> 15:48.080
And then hiding in the backseat, here's Jessica.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.680
Like that's not really scary, is it?

15:49.680 --> 15:53.200
Well, maybe, maybe we can find some inspiration and some answers.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.560
What do you, what do you think?

15:54.560 --> 15:56.320
Let's just dip in there and see what happens.

15:57.280 --> 16:05.280
Answer one says a bad storm comes and everyone is safe, but one young teenage boy.

16:05.280 --> 16:10.080
At the same time every morning, weird things happen where his death took place.

16:10.080 --> 16:15.040
It begins to attract more and more kids from his school, especially those who were close to him.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.080
Things begin to get stranger and stranger.

16:18.080 --> 16:23.840
Now that's my favorite part in every horror story is when things begin to get stranger and stranger.

16:23.840 --> 16:29.840
Those who were close to him decide to use a Ouija board to communicate with him at that same time,

16:29.840 --> 16:31.840
the same day, a year later.

16:31.840 --> 16:36.000
Unfortunately, they learned that it wasn't him the hard way.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.200
Wait, wait, hold on.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.600
Best thing I, best thing I could spring up at this time.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.320
Maybe you can work with it in other people's ideas.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.120
Wait, wait, wait.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.320
The kid lived, I thought.

16:44.960 --> 16:45.440
Did it?

16:45.440 --> 16:50.240
Because a bad storm came and everyone was safe except for one young teenage boy.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.560
Please try to get to, yeah.

16:52.560 --> 16:56.240
That is the worst urban legend I've ever heard.

16:56.240 --> 16:59.040
Hey, it's the best thing that they could spring up at this time.

16:59.040 --> 17:04.560
But the whole point of an urban legend is that you tell it to somebody and they go,

17:04.560 --> 17:07.200
oh yeah, I think I know someone that that happened to.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.400
Like who's going to listen to this?

17:08.400 --> 17:11.760
Like, oh yeah, I remember when that one young boy was in danger from the one storm,

17:11.760 --> 17:13.360
even though everyone else was safe.

17:13.360 --> 17:17.120
But then a year later they used a Ouija board, but it turned out it wasn't him the hard way.

17:18.240 --> 17:18.400
What?

17:18.400 --> 17:20.880
I think it's got stranger and then later stranger.

17:22.160 --> 17:22.880
What things?

17:24.960 --> 17:27.280
Have you noticed how strange this toast is?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.440
Yeah, I also noticed that this cup was strange.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.040
Everything's getting stranger and stranger.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.040
It's getting really strange today.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.080
Hey, hey man.

17:35.040 --> 17:40.400
My favorite Stephen King book is the one where my favorite line of his was,

17:40.400 --> 17:44.640
and then the guy went to a place and this scary thing happened.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.720
And it got scarier and scarier.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.840
They thought it was a scary thing, but it was another one.

17:49.840 --> 17:50.340
Boo.

17:50.880 --> 17:51.680
The hard way.

17:53.040 --> 17:53.920
Ghosted shit.

17:53.920 --> 17:58.320
What's the easy way to figure out that a ghost is a different ghost?

17:58.320 --> 17:59.520
Like find a note?

17:59.520 --> 18:01.200
So wait, did they think-

18:01.200 --> 18:06.560
Okay, so they try to get in touch with this little boy, Jessica, on the Ouija board.

18:07.440 --> 18:08.640
And it turned out that he-

18:09.360 --> 18:12.800
Is it that he didn't die or that there was another ghost hidden?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.640
I think there was another ghost.

18:14.640 --> 18:15.760
He definitely died.

18:15.760 --> 18:19.680
This is all just a really great spectral coincidence because,

18:21.120 --> 18:23.680
I mean, ghosts have to hang out where they die, like forever.

18:23.680 --> 18:24.160
Right?

18:24.160 --> 18:27.280
Ghosts can't just wonder unless they have Beetlejuice powers.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.560
But even then, they couldn't leave the house, right?

18:30.560 --> 18:33.040
Or else they got eaten by the dune sandworm.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.800
I haven't seen that movie in a long time.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.800
So I guess two ghosts got killed at the same place,

18:38.800 --> 18:42.240
and one was significantly scarier and stranger and stranger than the other one.

18:43.040 --> 18:43.440
I don't know.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.960
This obviously needs some workshopping.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.080
How about answer two?

18:47.120 --> 18:50.640
Who says, with my creative mind, I will help you.

18:50.640 --> 18:51.140
Oh, good.

18:51.140 --> 18:52.820
Oh, God. That's good, Eddie.

18:54.260 --> 18:57.220
This old woman lives in an old house with an old husband,

18:57.220 --> 19:00.420
and at night you can always see a candle lit in the top window of the attic.

19:02.980 --> 19:04.820
It is said they practice the occult.

19:08.180 --> 19:11.220
I heard it through the grapevine that these old, old dudes-

19:11.220 --> 19:18.340
Did you hear it through the grapevine? People say they hear moaning and screams coming from the cellar and home.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.180
Are you hearing screaming?

19:24.180 --> 19:24.660
I am.

19:24.660 --> 19:27.780
I can't tell if it's coming from their cellar or from the-

19:27.780 --> 19:31.860
Let's go in and investigate, because I don't know if it's from the lower part of the house or the upper part.

19:31.860 --> 19:34.340
The cellar is not part of the home proper.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.780
I think we can all agree.

19:35.780 --> 19:40.900
A cellar is basically a second bullshit home that you keep buried underneath your regular home,

19:40.900 --> 19:44.580
because you're so embarrassed of it, because it's just one big stupid room.

19:44.580 --> 19:48.900
Did you guys notice the moaning and screaming that comes from their cellar or home?

19:48.900 --> 19:50.740
Yeah, I heard that they practice the occult.

19:50.740 --> 19:52.420
And also, there's a candle in the window.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.420
Why did you bring up the candle?

19:54.420 --> 19:56.340
This is the best story ever.

19:56.340 --> 19:58.420
We're talking about occult. Why did you bring up the candle, bro?

19:58.420 --> 20:01.220
Screams and stuff, and it turns out there's a candle in their window.

20:01.220 --> 20:04.420
Guys, it's about to get stranger and stranger. Just buckle up.

20:04.420 --> 20:05.300
Okay.

20:05.300 --> 20:08.500
After about 20 years, the woman and man disappear.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.700
Okay.

20:09.700 --> 20:13.220
The purchaser of the home finds a secret door in the cellar.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.860
He also finds marked graves.

20:15.860 --> 20:18.740
Wait, wait, wait. The seller of the- the person who sold the home to him?

20:18.740 --> 20:19.860
Oh shit, this is getting-

20:20.420 --> 20:25.780
Yes, there was a secret door hidden inside the body of the real estate agent who sold this spooky,

20:25.780 --> 20:26.420
spooky home.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.940
He also finds marked graves.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.700
There have been children disappearing for years in the town.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.300
Maybe you could have mentioned that earlier.

20:35.300 --> 20:41.220
Uh, and when they dig up the graves, they only find three of the 14 missing.

20:41.220 --> 20:42.260
Where are the rest?

20:43.460 --> 20:44.500
Why are there three there?

20:44.500 --> 20:45.300
Right.

20:45.300 --> 20:48.660
They say the rest were buried in the backyard.

20:48.660 --> 20:50.580
They dig up the backyard to no avail.

20:51.300 --> 20:52.980
This is boring!

20:52.980 --> 20:54.740
Wait, wait, what?

20:54.740 --> 20:56.660
Here's some other shit that has no significance.

20:56.660 --> 20:59.940
Did you hear the one about the guys who went in the forest looking for the monster?

20:59.940 --> 21:03.060
There was no monster there, but still, it was pretty creepy.

21:03.060 --> 21:05.780
Yeah, they got really- got close to his friends.

21:05.780 --> 21:09.140
Another- another secret door in the attic is discovered.

21:10.020 --> 21:10.740
What's it?

21:10.740 --> 21:11.220
There-

21:11.220 --> 21:12.260
There's a candle!

21:13.140 --> 21:16.980
There are the bones and skulls of the remaining 12 children.

21:18.740 --> 21:22.900
The old people have disappeared, and to this day, might be your neighbors.

21:22.900 --> 21:23.700
It is-

21:23.700 --> 21:24.740
I know my neighbors.

21:24.740 --> 21:25.380
They are not-

21:26.340 --> 21:26.980
I- I don't-

21:26.980 --> 21:34.100
I don't- it is said with the occult, they were in- they found a way to live forever.

21:34.100 --> 21:34.340
Good luck.

21:34.340 --> 21:35.540
Are you still going on with this?

21:36.340 --> 21:36.900
Yeah, that's it.

21:36.900 --> 21:37.380
Okay.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.340
It ends with good luck.

21:39.620 --> 21:42.900
Here's a quick- a quick lesson in- in urban legend.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.100
Urban legend.

21:44.100 --> 21:48.100
Kid was sticking his head out a window, a car was passing with a dog sticking their

21:48.100 --> 21:51.060
head out the window, the kid knocked the dog's head off.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.420
That's an urban legend.

21:52.420 --> 21:54.020
Yeah, or like chupacabra.

21:54.020 --> 21:56.020
Like, these are all good urban legends.

21:56.020 --> 21:56.980
Not-

21:56.980 --> 21:57.540
Fucking-

21:57.540 --> 22:00.420
And then they look in the basement, but they couldn't find anything.

22:00.420 --> 22:04.740
There was an old house with old people in it, and there were screams in it, and also

22:04.740 --> 22:09.140
a candle, and then 20 years passed, and people bought it, and they found three out of 14

22:09.140 --> 22:12.100
missing kids, and they thought they looked in the backyard, but nope.

22:12.100 --> 22:13.220
Got an attic.

22:13.220 --> 22:14.740
It's bones and shit.

22:14.740 --> 22:16.020
They're not your neighbors.

22:16.020 --> 22:19.860
The thing that's- that's fucking me up is the- okay, where is the graveyard?

22:19.860 --> 22:20.740
Is that clarified?

22:21.620 --> 22:22.100
I think it's in-

22:22.100 --> 22:23.220
The marked graves?

22:23.220 --> 22:24.500
The secret door in the cellar?

22:24.500 --> 22:25.700
No, no, no.

22:25.700 --> 22:28.500
The graveyard that they find with the gravestones and stuff.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.100
Yeah, it's in the secret door in the cellar.

22:30.660 --> 22:32.020
Okay, okay, so, okay.

22:32.820 --> 22:33.300
So wait.

22:34.340 --> 22:41.940
These old people basically have been killing kids for sacrifice, and they- they went to

22:41.940 --> 22:48.020
their basement after they killed them and dug 14 graves and put like, marks up and stuff,

22:48.020 --> 22:48.260
right?

22:48.260 --> 22:51.220
They only put- they only put three dead kids in there.

22:51.220 --> 22:55.700
Yeah, so they were planning on being far busier than they had planned originally.

22:55.700 --> 23:00.260
Is that- or he got lazy, like, Carl, will you please take those dead kids out of the

23:00.260 --> 23:01.780
attic and bury them in our cellar?

23:01.780 --> 23:03.700
I mean, that's- that's the thing, isn't it?

23:03.700 --> 23:05.860
First of all, first of all, one thing I just put together-

23:05.860 --> 23:07.060
I did it already, June!

23:07.700 --> 23:11.300
They dug up the graves and only found three of the 14 children missing, but they found

23:11.300 --> 23:14.260
12 kids worth of bones in the attic.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.780
They found an extra kid.

23:15.780 --> 23:19.380
That's 15- that's 15 dead kid bodies, like-

23:19.380 --> 23:22.020
Where did this extra kid come from?

23:22.020 --> 23:22.900
I don't know, just check it.

23:22.900 --> 23:25.700
Where did these numbers come from in the first place?

23:25.700 --> 23:27.620
This guy's typing on y'all here answers.

23:28.420 --> 23:30.740
There's like 14 kids, I guess.

23:30.740 --> 23:34.500
If you grew up in this fictional town, you would- you would know about the 14 missing

23:34.500 --> 23:35.140
kids.

23:35.140 --> 23:37.060
I think- I think we can just assume that.

23:37.060 --> 23:38.100
This is like, lost.

23:38.100 --> 23:39.460
I want to know more about this.

23:39.460 --> 23:40.020
This is-

23:40.020 --> 23:40.980
Here's my issue.

23:42.100 --> 23:42.980
You have one issue.

23:42.980 --> 23:43.860
I have one issue.

23:43.860 --> 23:48.980
I have one plot point, one hole that- that my- my comprehension is falling through.

23:48.980 --> 23:49.860
They have 11.

23:50.420 --> 23:51.140
That is this.

23:51.780 --> 23:52.180
All right.

23:52.740 --> 23:58.580
So they look in the cellar where there were screams coming from, and they find three of

23:58.580 --> 24:03.460
the bodies, and they find the rest in the goddamn attic where no streams were coming

24:03.460 --> 24:03.860
from.

24:03.860 --> 24:06.580
The screams were either coming from the cellar or the home.

24:06.580 --> 24:07.780
They don't mention the attic.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.380
Why are there bodies in the attic?

24:09.380 --> 24:15.460
And like, from what I understand, these people, these occultists, were old as fuck.

24:15.460 --> 24:21.540
Like, how are they going to carry 12 kid- 12 super, super dead kids up three flights

24:21.540 --> 24:24.100
of stairs, assuming the house is two stories tall?

24:24.100 --> 24:26.740
Have you ever- ever tried to carry a dead kid?

24:26.740 --> 24:28.500
Because it's like cord- like, it is-

24:28.500 --> 24:30.260
It's heavier than you would think.

24:30.260 --> 24:30.500
Like-

24:30.500 --> 24:31.460
They go limp.

24:31.460 --> 24:32.980
Like, they go wicked limp, and you've got to-

24:32.980 --> 24:34.900
They do not help whatsoever.

24:34.900 --> 24:36.260
No, they're not pitching in.

24:36.260 --> 24:40.420
Why would these people not get a sing- I wish the town would all chip in and get these

24:40.420 --> 24:48.340
people like a nice, you know, single level, maybe a wheelchair ramp, something a little

24:48.340 --> 24:53.220
bit more accessible, so they can kill kids and not have to put their old, old joints

24:53.220 --> 24:54.740
in- in such disrepair?

24:54.740 --> 24:56.100
This is just really bad planning.

24:56.100 --> 24:59.060
I- I expect more from our- our nation's elderly.

24:59.700 --> 25:05.140
Hey, my bim bam, I have this friend on Facebook who comments on almost every single post people

25:05.140 --> 25:11.060
put up, and it's usually just stupid, meaningless things like lull or smiley faces.

25:11.060 --> 25:16.020
He's starting to get really on my nerves, and I know other people are annoyed too.

25:17.220 --> 25:21.860
I don't want to confront him about this, and deleting him as a friend seems too harsh.

25:22.420 --> 25:23.220
Any advice?

25:23.220 --> 25:24.340
Oh, man.

25:24.340 --> 25:24.580
Man.

25:24.580 --> 25:26.500
Deleting him as a friend, how will he ever recover?

25:27.140 --> 25:28.980
I know, and you don't want to confront him either.

25:29.940 --> 25:32.660
Brad, if you're not going to confront a Facebook friend, you're going to have to deal with

25:32.660 --> 25:34.340
the fucking lulls, my buddy.

25:34.340 --> 25:35.540
Yeah.

25:35.540 --> 25:36.660
This is America.

25:36.660 --> 25:42.100
This is one of those, like, it's almost like a trick question where him doing it isn't

25:42.100 --> 25:46.340
that bad, and you telling him to stop doing it isn't that bad.

25:47.060 --> 25:48.580
It's fucking Facebook.

25:48.580 --> 25:49.540
It's Facebook!

25:49.540 --> 25:50.900
Nothing matters!

25:50.900 --> 25:53.540
Just don't read his stupid comments!

25:54.500 --> 25:56.900
Yeah, either ignore it, because it's fucking Facebook.

25:56.900 --> 26:00.580
Nothing on the internet that you do matters, especially not on Facebook.

26:00.580 --> 26:01.080
Yeah.

26:01.080 --> 26:06.120
Now, if he was coming over to your house every day and, like, knocking on your door and saying

26:06.120 --> 26:09.640
lull and running off, by all means, kill that man.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.400
No, no, that'd be awesome.

26:11.400 --> 26:11.900
Whatever.

26:12.760 --> 26:13.560
I would love that.

26:13.560 --> 26:14.680
I need that friend in my life.

26:14.680 --> 26:19.640
What if you could have him, like, behind your couch, so you're talking to your brain wife,

26:19.640 --> 26:24.680
and you make a really good zinger, and he just pops up, lull, and then hides that way.

26:24.680 --> 26:25.320
I'd take it back.

26:25.320 --> 26:26.280
That would rule.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.320
It would be awesome, right?

26:27.320 --> 26:32.280
He just makes a smiley face with his face, and then goes away.

26:32.280 --> 26:35.400
And he just gives you a thumbs up and says, I like this, and then goes away.

26:35.400 --> 26:36.200
Who's at the window?

26:36.920 --> 26:37.960
There's somebody at the window.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.120
It's Frank.

26:40.120 --> 26:40.920
He's smiling.

26:40.920 --> 26:41.560
He's smiling at what you just said.

26:41.560 --> 26:45.080
He's just letting us know that this video we were talking about is really funny.

26:46.280 --> 26:50.920
There's some people like that on the internet that just, they're incapable of either creating

26:50.920 --> 26:56.440
or finding things that are awesome, so they just, you know, they react to them, but they

26:56.440 --> 26:59.880
do it with two to four keystrokes.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.640
That's like all the energy that they have in them.

27:03.640 --> 27:04.520
And that's fine.

27:04.520 --> 27:05.720
Those people have their place.

27:06.280 --> 27:10.200
I appreciate the economy of that, because if he was getting on and every single thing

27:10.200 --> 27:15.960
everyone posted, and he would type out a paragraph describing why he enjoyed that thing and why

27:15.960 --> 27:20.840
others should enjoy it too, dude, just put a smiley face so I can ignore it and move

27:20.840 --> 27:23.240
on with my life and get back to Farmville, you know?

27:24.440 --> 27:25.640
Like is a good button.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.320
Tell him to start using like.

27:27.320 --> 27:31.240
Tell him that you, tell him that you give 10 cents to charity every time he clicks like

27:31.240 --> 27:34.040
on something and it just, and doesn't comment on it.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.680
Let's go a little more life affirming.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.080
We have a, we have a special question.

27:39.720 --> 27:42.360
Who did, who did this one come to us from, Griffin?

27:42.360 --> 27:45.240
This one was sent in by one Mr. Jonathan Anderson.

27:46.360 --> 27:46.840
Okay.

27:46.840 --> 27:47.560
And you know what?

27:47.560 --> 27:48.680
It's such a special occasion.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.680
Let's let Jonathan ask himself.

27:50.680 --> 27:51.480
What do you think?

27:51.480 --> 27:52.040
Go for it.

27:52.040 --> 27:56.200
Hey guys, this is John from Brooklyn and I'm in need of a bit of advice.

27:56.200 --> 27:59.480
I've been dating my girlfriend Katie for the last four years.

27:59.480 --> 28:03.080
We met at college and have been madly in love ever since.

28:04.200 --> 28:10.840
I recently dropped stacks on a engagement ring for her, but just can't think of the

28:10.840 --> 28:12.440
best way to do it.

28:12.440 --> 28:16.040
Can you guys tell me how to, how I should propose to this, the love of my life?

28:16.680 --> 28:17.320
Thanks guys.

28:17.320 --> 28:17.800
Bye bye.

28:18.840 --> 28:19.720
A fine question.

28:19.720 --> 28:24.360
Uh, a difficult, uh, a difficult thing to do, do well.

28:24.360 --> 28:28.760
Um, we have, we've actually answered this question before, uh, but it was a, it was

28:28.760 --> 28:30.360
a total phony joke.

28:30.920 --> 28:35.720
Uh, and this time, unless Jonathan's running the short grift on us, I think it's legit.

28:36.440 --> 28:37.480
Yeah, I think it's legit.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.280
Welcome.

28:38.280 --> 28:43.880
What a treat for our, uh, uh, maximum fun friends, our new maximum fun friends that

28:43.880 --> 28:49.000
they are here for our very first, very real wedding proposal.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.400
Now, uh, maybe we could just walk Jonathan through this step-by-step.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.120
Yeah.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.600
I mean, he's in the moment right now, like listening to our voice.

28:56.600 --> 28:59.400
This is, this is the most magical moment of his entire life.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.920
Take a knee left or right.

29:00.920 --> 29:01.640
Doesn't matter.

29:01.640 --> 29:02.280
No, right knee.

29:02.280 --> 29:04.440
Cause if you take a left knee, go right knee.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.760
You know how the divorce rate is 50 50.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.360
It's because the knees.

29:08.360 --> 29:08.920
Yeah.

29:08.920 --> 29:09.160
Yeah.

29:09.160 --> 29:10.920
So go down to the right or it's over.

29:10.920 --> 29:11.160
Right.

29:11.720 --> 29:11.960
Okay.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.760
Now you're going to reach in your pocket and make eye contact.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.120
This is very important.

29:16.120 --> 29:17.240
Don't fall over.

29:17.240 --> 29:19.320
Don't fall over cause then you'll be a joke.

29:19.320 --> 29:19.560
Yeah.

29:19.560 --> 29:19.800
Yeah.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.200
And look at her straight in the eye.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.920
I hope if she has eyes, let's say she has eyes.

29:24.920 --> 29:25.080
Okay.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.200
Look her straight in the eye.

29:26.200 --> 29:26.440
Okay.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.720
No, like, no, not like that, Jonathan.

29:29.720 --> 29:30.760
You're looking too serious.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.680
Like, look, it's a good, it's a good moment.

29:32.680 --> 29:34.040
Have like a half smile.

29:34.040 --> 29:34.360
Half smile.

29:34.360 --> 29:35.960
Like a half, like knowing smile.

29:37.000 --> 29:37.560
That's good.

29:37.560 --> 29:38.200
That's good.

29:38.200 --> 29:38.680
That's good.

29:38.680 --> 29:41.000
Now sweat a little bit more than you are right now.

29:41.000 --> 29:41.400
Yeah.

29:41.400 --> 29:44.600
Can you give your hair a little must just to give it some rakish charm?

29:44.600 --> 29:45.160
There we go.

29:45.160 --> 29:45.560
That's good.

29:45.560 --> 29:45.800
Great.

29:45.800 --> 29:46.760
All right.

29:46.760 --> 29:47.960
He's already done it.

29:47.960 --> 29:48.600
We just done it.

29:48.600 --> 29:49.640
We took too long.

29:49.640 --> 29:50.120
No, no, no.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.240
He's still, he's still in the moment.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.600
He's going step by step.

29:52.600 --> 29:52.840
Okay.

29:52.840 --> 29:56.680
Now you're going to pull your hands out, but you're going to do this like clamshell kind of thing.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.040
Where you're like, you're covering something up in your hand.

30:00.040 --> 30:00.760
What could it be?

30:01.720 --> 30:02.360
And it's a candy.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.720
It's a Werther's original.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.160
Catch her off guard first.

30:05.160 --> 30:06.200
She won't see that coming.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.800
And then explain to her that you got her a picture of a ring.

30:12.200 --> 30:14.520
It's a ring you got off Craigslist and a picture of it.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.840
Cause the guys that brought it by yet, but he seems straight up.

30:16.840 --> 30:17.880
No, you have a ring.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.280
Get the ring out.

30:20.280 --> 30:22.920
You open the ring, but open it sort of close to her face.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.120
So it looks bigger.

30:24.120 --> 30:24.760
This is key.

30:25.640 --> 30:26.600
You got to do this.

30:26.600 --> 30:27.720
You got to do it just that way.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.640
Now pull back a little bit cause you're freaking her out.

30:29.640 --> 30:29.880
Yeah.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.760
Now, and hopefully she's crying at this point.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.440
Oh, she's openly weeping.

30:35.000 --> 30:35.320
Okay.

30:35.320 --> 30:35.560
Good.

30:35.560 --> 30:36.680
It's happy tears though.

30:37.240 --> 30:37.480
Okay.

30:37.480 --> 30:38.520
Do we know her name?

30:38.520 --> 30:39.080
Katie.

30:39.080 --> 30:39.640
It's Katie.

30:39.640 --> 30:40.200
Katie.

30:40.200 --> 30:40.680
Katie.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.680
Look at this boy, Katie.

30:42.680 --> 30:43.640
He is here for you.

30:43.640 --> 30:50.760
He's chosen the most romantic way that I could think of to ask you to be with him forever and

30:50.760 --> 30:51.720
ever and ever and ever and ever.

30:51.720 --> 30:53.880
And I straight up, I mean this with all respect.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.400
You're not going to do any better.

30:55.400 --> 30:56.280
No, no, no.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.960
He's the best you're going to do.

30:57.960 --> 30:58.520
Look at it.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.640
Jonathan Anderson.

30:59.640 --> 31:00.360
Are you kidding me?

31:00.360 --> 31:01.960
That's the most powerful.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.360
That name is just, that's, that's a virile name.

31:04.920 --> 31:05.880
It's full of guys.

31:05.880 --> 31:07.400
It's full of Vim and vigor.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.240
You can't get any better than that.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.520
His knee is starting to hurt guys.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.880
We got to bring this up.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.120
We're going to put on some mood music.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.200
Justin's going to put on On the Wings of Love.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.480
We're going to edit that in right now.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.000
I definitely won't forget to do that.

31:21.800 --> 31:22.200
Okay.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.640
So now, oh, that's good.

31:23.640 --> 31:24.520
That's going real good.

31:24.520 --> 31:26.360
Now, Jonathan, look her in the eyes.

31:26.360 --> 31:29.480
We're going to give you like literally three seconds to say something special.

31:29.480 --> 31:29.720
Go.

31:34.440 --> 31:35.800
And then, okay, now ask her.

31:35.800 --> 31:40.360
Do it.

31:40.360 --> 31:41.080
Katie, come back.

31:42.280 --> 31:43.000
Katie, no, wait.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.200
Hey, Jonathan.

31:46.200 --> 31:46.680
Listen.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.040
Hey, wait.

31:48.040 --> 31:48.600
She's back.

31:48.600 --> 31:49.080
She's back.

31:49.080 --> 31:49.400
Okay.

31:49.400 --> 31:50.440
She rethought it.

31:50.440 --> 31:51.320
She rethought it.

31:51.320 --> 31:53.400
It looks like, that looks like a big yes.

31:54.680 --> 31:55.800
So congratulations.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.960
This is a weird way to do this because we have no way.

31:57.960 --> 32:01.240
He said he was going to send in their, send in their response.

32:01.960 --> 32:02.840
God almighty.

32:02.840 --> 32:07.480
God, I really hope it's yes, or this one thing is just so sad.

32:07.480 --> 32:08.200
Jonathan, listen.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.120
If it's not a yes, you can never let us know.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.320
We couldn't take the rejection, honestly.

32:13.880 --> 32:14.840
What do you think he said?

32:14.840 --> 32:15.960
How do you think he phrased it?

32:16.760 --> 32:17.880
How do you think he said?

32:17.880 --> 32:19.400
I think he just said, I'm sorry.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.920
I'm so, so sorry.

32:20.920 --> 32:25.880
Seemed like such a good idea before, but now it seems like a really bad idea that I had.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.240
Let's not tell the kids.

32:27.240 --> 32:30.920
Write us in five years and we'll help you come up with a story for how it really happened.

32:30.920 --> 32:36.360
What if he just said, like, get at me, he just put that ring out there.

32:36.360 --> 32:38.920
I was just like, hey, get at it, get it.

32:39.560 --> 32:40.120
He looks at her.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.040
He's like, Hey, weirdest first date ever, right?

32:42.040 --> 32:42.520
Hey,

32:47.080 --> 32:48.280
congratulations.

32:48.280 --> 32:48.760
You too.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.120
I'm sure, I'm sure it went well.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.240
Or condolences the other way.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.760
Yeah, one of those two.

32:52.760 --> 32:57.000
Hey, how about we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.200
we break up the flow a little bit with a, with a Yahoo.

33:00.200 --> 33:00.600
Okay.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.000
This one was sent in by Jonathan Bartram.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.120
Thank you, Jonathan Bartram.

33:04.840 --> 33:07.240
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Donnie J.

33:07.240 --> 33:11.320
Who asks, do aliens go to heaven and hell also?

33:13.480 --> 33:18.040
There is no way earth is the only planet with life out of billions of planets.

33:18.040 --> 33:21.880
So does aliens from other parts of the universe go to hell and heaven also,

33:21.880 --> 33:23.720
or is it only strictly for humans?

33:23.720 --> 33:29.160
We've addressed the, the concept of, of, um, you know, extraterrestrial spirituality in a previous

33:29.160 --> 33:33.080
episode, uh, where we established that each planet does in fact have its own Jesus.

33:33.080 --> 33:35.880
Uh, so everybody knows that.

33:35.880 --> 33:39.640
I think that it only makes sense that other planets would have their own heavens too,

33:39.640 --> 33:41.880
because I don't want to sound like a bigot or nothing.

33:42.840 --> 33:47.880
I don't want to spend eternity with a bunch of, a bunch of off worlders, which is, uh,

33:47.880 --> 33:54.600
as everyone knows the, the racist term for outer space.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.560
Here's the thing though.

33:55.560 --> 33:57.000
This is what you're forgetting.

33:57.000 --> 34:03.560
If by alien, you, you are implying that is someone from another planet coming to our planet.

34:03.560 --> 34:09.640
And as everyone knows, if you die on this planet, you're under the jurisdiction of Earth God.

34:09.640 --> 34:11.000
Of Earth God and Earth Jesus.

34:11.000 --> 34:11.240
Yeah.

34:12.120 --> 34:16.440
A lot of people, a lot of planets will actually like, if you're an alien and you

34:16.440 --> 34:20.600
do something really terrible, like you'll make a run for the border and then try to

34:20.600 --> 34:21.960
die when you cross it.

34:21.960 --> 34:27.320
Cause Mars Jesus, Mars Jesus and Mars God will follow you right to like the border.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.920
You know that asteroid belt between the two?

34:28.920 --> 34:30.200
It'll follow you right there.

34:30.200 --> 34:34.200
And then it's sort of like smoking the band, like throw his hat down.

34:34.200 --> 34:37.240
Like, Oh God, got away again.

34:37.240 --> 34:38.440
And then you got to go die on Earth.

34:38.440 --> 34:39.080
And then Earth.

34:39.080 --> 34:41.560
But Earth heaven beats the shit out of Mars heaven.

34:41.560 --> 34:45.560
It beats the shit out of basically our whole, the whole Milky Way thing that we have.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.560
Earth is totally the best.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.200
I think we can all agree.

34:48.200 --> 34:49.640
Well, if you come from Mars, yeah.

34:49.640 --> 34:53.240
But if you die on Earth and then go to Earth heaven, a lot of people think it's a step

34:53.240 --> 34:57.720
down because they they're still making coffee from pots instead of like those pods, like

34:57.720 --> 34:59.720
single serve up in Earth heaven.

34:59.720 --> 35:03.080
But to be fair, have you guys ever visited Neptune heaven?

35:03.080 --> 35:04.680
That's the party heaven.

35:04.680 --> 35:05.080
Is it really?

35:05.080 --> 35:06.040
Is that party heaven?

35:06.040 --> 35:06.360
Yeah.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.120
That is the party heaven.

35:08.120 --> 35:09.080
Don't get me wrong.

35:09.080 --> 35:10.600
Their infrastructure is shit.

35:10.600 --> 35:13.160
Like there's no clean water and the bathrooms suck.

35:13.160 --> 35:16.120
But it is a rave 24 seven.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.840
It's a very, it's a very cold, moist planet.

35:18.840 --> 35:23.160
So I think that I, I guess that raving is really all they have to do there.

35:23.880 --> 35:28.920
You know, if you drink a tube of fluorescent while you're in Neptune heaven, nothing happens.

35:28.920 --> 35:29.800
It's like the best thing.

35:29.800 --> 35:31.400
If you drink a glow stick, you mean?

35:31.400 --> 35:32.360
If you drink the glow stick.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.800
Yeah, exactly.

35:33.800 --> 35:34.360
No grip.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.720
A tube of fluorescent.

35:37.240 --> 35:38.840
That's why the words wouldn't come.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.200
That's what they call them in the UK.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.840
Yeah, crazy.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.080
Give me a tube of that fluorescent juice.

35:45.080 --> 35:46.520
God blimey.

35:46.520 --> 35:47.560
Oh, good.

35:47.560 --> 35:48.840
That's great, Travis.

35:50.680 --> 35:54.680
We're showing off our talents on this, our first maximum fun episode.

35:54.680 --> 35:56.280
Quick, Griffin, play the spoons.

35:57.640 --> 36:05.480
We, no, but you, do you know what happened when they declassified Pluto as a planet?

36:05.480 --> 36:10.680
All those spirits were injected into the inky blackness of space.

36:10.680 --> 36:12.040
Good work, scientist.

36:12.040 --> 36:12.840
Thanks, scientist.

36:12.840 --> 36:15.960
You sent a bunch of souls to oblivion forever.

36:17.080 --> 36:21.640
Yeah, Pluto Nash is actually about him looking for the spirit of his grandma

36:21.640 --> 36:23.240
Ma to rescue her from the abyss.

36:23.240 --> 36:23.800
That's true.

36:23.800 --> 36:24.440
That's science.

36:24.440 --> 36:25.480
All joking aside.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.400
Yeah, finally.

36:27.400 --> 36:33.320
This is, this is why the space race is still so, just so vitally important because we've

36:33.320 --> 36:39.560
only spread the word of Earth Jesus to the moon and that's, that's it.

36:39.560 --> 36:42.920
The rest of it, I mean, we shoot satellites with Earth Jesus's message, like into the

36:42.920 --> 36:46.200
stars, into the heavens, but, but I don't know.

36:46.200 --> 36:50.680
I feel like that's not as effective as, you know, an actual astronaut armed with the,

36:50.680 --> 36:52.680
the good book and maybe a few chick tracks.

36:53.400 --> 37:00.600
So, just support NASA with all your money because it'll help save aliens from going

37:00.600 --> 37:01.720
to hell forever.

37:01.720 --> 37:06.040
You don't want aliens to go to hell and Mars, hell, forget about it.

37:06.040 --> 37:10.120
Mars is already basically hell and then you add on the fact that it's hell.

37:11.320 --> 37:13.000
Well, you don't want any slice of that.

37:13.960 --> 37:19.000
I take city buses to and from my college campus and last month I noticed a dollar on the floor

37:19.000 --> 37:19.560
above my feet.

37:20.440 --> 37:24.040
Since no one was near me and no one seemed to be freaking out over lost money, I decided

37:24.040 --> 37:24.920
to take it.

37:24.920 --> 37:29.400
I feel that if I had asked any other passengers if it was theirs, any unscrupulous individual

37:29.400 --> 37:33.480
would have claimed it was theirs, regardless of whether it was or not.

37:33.480 --> 37:35.320
What's the proper etiquette in this situation?

37:35.320 --> 37:39.400
Is it better to ask around or is it a reward for the first person who knows it on the ground?

37:39.400 --> 37:43.320
Sincerely, victim of circumstance, victim of circumstance.

37:43.320 --> 37:46.360
What year are you living in that a dollar is worth thinking about?

37:46.360 --> 37:47.960
Yeah, I wouldn't even pick it up.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.000
I tear it in half.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.120
Have you seen the economy?

37:50.120 --> 37:54.760
It's not only the tremendous physical effort that goes into bending down and retrieving

37:54.760 --> 38:01.160
an item from the ground, it's, you're basically, you're selling your own shame whenever you

38:01.160 --> 38:02.120
pick up money off the ground.

38:02.120 --> 38:06.200
You are selling your shame because you should be ashamed because you're like a dog, you're

38:06.200 --> 38:10.280
like a plebe, you're like a peasant picking up whatever scraps of currency that people

38:10.280 --> 38:11.720
have left lying around for you.

38:11.720 --> 38:15.800
It's shameful and I don't think that a dollar is a good exchange rate.

38:15.800 --> 38:17.400
I wouldn't do it for anything less than ten.

38:18.440 --> 38:23.320
I read in Monocle that the rich are, have been taking up throwing money on the ground

38:23.320 --> 38:25.080
and waiting for poor people to pick it up.

38:25.080 --> 38:26.120
Yeah, like for sport.

38:27.080 --> 38:30.840
So that, you don't want to be the puppet in the game, like in Hard Target with John

38:30.840 --> 38:33.400
Golf Van Damme, where you're playing a rich man's game.

38:33.400 --> 38:39.160
Like you want to, you want to be your own man who doesn't bend over for money.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.160
Now fiver, all right.

38:41.160 --> 38:45.720
Fiver is, a fiver is, I don't know, it's a gray area in my mind.

38:45.720 --> 38:51.560
I say one, fuck no, coins, don't be a, don't be a child, don't even think about coins.

38:51.560 --> 38:54.360
See, I disagree with that, if it's a quarter, I'll pick it up.

38:54.360 --> 38:56.120
Cause who doesn't always need a quarter?

38:56.120 --> 38:59.720
That's the thing man, parking meters, I always need a quarter.

38:59.720 --> 39:00.040
Yeah.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.600
And who doesn't always want some gum and you're like, who has coins?

39:02.600 --> 39:03.640
No one has coins.

39:03.640 --> 39:03.880
Yeah.

39:04.600 --> 39:07.800
You're basically, it's a future, it's an investment in future gum if you pick up a

39:07.800 --> 39:11.000
quarter, a dollar that you can't even get a soda with a dollar bill anymore.

39:11.800 --> 39:12.200
Quarters are still useful.

39:12.200 --> 39:12.920
You know what I do?

39:13.560 --> 39:13.960
What?

39:13.960 --> 39:15.560
I just pick people's pockets.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.080
Just take it right out of their pockets.

39:17.080 --> 39:18.360
Charles cuts out the middle man.

39:19.160 --> 39:19.400
Yeah.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.320
They're probably going to drop it anyway.

39:21.320 --> 39:21.640
Yeah.

39:21.640 --> 39:22.920
They want you to have it.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.000
They want you to have it.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.760
Now, pennies don't get me started on pennies.

39:27.720 --> 39:32.040
If you give me pennies as change, like at the Costco or the Speedway, I will throw them

39:32.040 --> 39:32.600
back in your face.

39:33.160 --> 39:36.840
I think bending over to pick up a dollar is a hundred times worse than picking up a penny.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.120
What is mathematically?

39:40.120 --> 39:40.360
Yes.

39:40.920 --> 39:41.640
Thank you.

39:41.640 --> 39:46.600
What is the largest amount of money that you guys have found just like lying around in

39:46.600 --> 39:49.000
the wild that you didn't have to work for?

39:49.000 --> 39:52.840
You just sort of, you happened upon it and you made it your own by way of your actions.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.640
I found $64 once.

39:56.600 --> 40:00.840
I found $60 in an envelope at King's Island on a church trip.

40:01.640 --> 40:06.840
And I think the good earth Jesusy thing to do would have been to give it to the lost

40:06.840 --> 40:08.200
and found so it could be returned.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.320
Because you know, you're a kid.

40:09.320 --> 40:12.360
You put your money in an envelope when you go to a theme park because you don't have

40:12.360 --> 40:13.080
a wallet yet.

40:13.080 --> 40:13.720
But man, no.

40:13.720 --> 40:14.520
Please tell me you did that.

40:14.520 --> 40:15.320
Oh, I put that.

40:15.320 --> 40:17.160
Oh, that shit went right in my pocket.

40:17.160 --> 40:20.600
I bought a fanny pack with that money.

40:20.600 --> 40:23.720
Ironically, if that kid has made that investment, he wouldn't have dropped his money.

40:23.720 --> 40:23.960
Yeah.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.320
Well, no, I took the money.

40:25.320 --> 40:29.160
I took the remainder of the money and put it right in the fanny pack because I was a

40:29.160 --> 40:30.280
pretty streetwise young kid.

40:30.840 --> 40:31.720
You're a sucker.

40:31.720 --> 40:32.360
I'm no sucker.

40:32.360 --> 40:35.880
And I wore it with the buckle on the front so that nobody could snap it off on me.

40:35.880 --> 40:37.160
Nice try, kid.

40:37.160 --> 40:41.960
I found $64 at work and I did the right thing and I gave it to my boss and said, someone's

40:41.960 --> 40:43.160
probably going to come asking for this.

40:43.160 --> 40:44.120
And they didn't.

40:44.120 --> 40:49.800
Which meant 30 days later, my boss just like randomly handed me $64 and was like, oh, here's

40:49.800 --> 40:51.240
this, by the way, no one picked it up.

40:51.240 --> 40:55.480
And it was like the sweetest like, hey, thanks for doing the right thing bonus.

40:56.600 --> 40:59.080
But I don't think you get that same response from a dollar.

40:59.080 --> 41:02.600
Like if you went up to the bus driver and said, excuse me, dear sir, I believe someone

41:02.600 --> 41:03.080
dropped this.

41:03.080 --> 41:06.600
Please hold on to it for me for 30 days in case someone comes to claim it.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.000
Sure.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.440
No, just go out and buy, I don't know, a pop.

41:10.440 --> 41:11.640
What can you buy for a dollar?

41:11.640 --> 41:14.440
When you're at work, you don't really have a choice in the matter, do you?

41:14.440 --> 41:18.040
Because I could just like when I worked at GameStop, I could just like open up the register

41:18.040 --> 41:19.720
and be like, oh, I found $2,300.

41:20.440 --> 41:21.000
What do you know?

41:21.640 --> 41:22.760
I guess it's mine now.

41:22.760 --> 41:25.080
So I guess what we're saying is steal.

41:26.200 --> 41:30.200
Yeah, but don't like go look and by the way, this is not rocket science.

41:30.200 --> 41:34.200
If you find a larger amount that's actually worth your investment, pick it up.

41:34.200 --> 41:38.680
See if anybody, look around, see if anybody's like giving you the stink eye and then say,

41:38.680 --> 41:40.120
did anybody lose some money?

41:40.120 --> 41:41.720
And they have to tell you exactly how much it was.

41:41.720 --> 41:45.400
Yeah, just don't say that somebody lose $64 so someone lose money.

41:45.400 --> 41:47.240
Because everybody will say, yes, right.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.120
I would never do that.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.840
I'm sorry, I would never do that.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.440
If I find money on the ground, it's mine.

41:52.440 --> 41:53.400
And I'll tell you why.

41:53.400 --> 41:58.520
It's because I lost my wallet at Camden Park, which is weird because I just told two theme

41:58.520 --> 42:01.960
park related stories in the same breath.

42:01.960 --> 42:05.000
But like, I lost my wallet, okay?

42:05.000 --> 42:08.920
And there were maybe $8 in it because I was just a little baby boy.

42:08.920 --> 42:13.720
But I did have my learner's permit in there and like some other like important shit.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.280
And nobody turned my wallet in.

42:16.280 --> 42:17.560
They kept it for the $8.

42:18.200 --> 42:21.720
The immense hassle I had to go through to get it like a new learner's permit and like

42:21.720 --> 42:23.640
a new, I had like my social security card.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.800
I had some shit in there, some important shit.

42:25.800 --> 42:27.640
And it was gone forever over $8.

42:28.520 --> 42:32.520
That's just that made me the angry shell of a person I am today.

42:32.520 --> 42:36.040
If I find any money or any object on the ground, it's mine.

42:36.040 --> 42:36.520
Sorry.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.040
So it's like pay it forward.

42:38.040 --> 42:39.480
It's pay it backward, actually.

42:39.480 --> 42:40.520
It's pay it inward.

42:42.360 --> 42:43.400
Excuse me?

42:43.400 --> 42:44.440
It's pay it inward.

42:44.440 --> 42:48.280
If somebody does something shitty to you, you do three shitty things to the rest of the planet.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.120
You feel better about yourself.

42:50.120 --> 42:51.240
You don't feel better about yourself.

42:51.240 --> 42:52.680
You just get angry and angrier.

42:52.680 --> 42:53.320
And then at the end-

42:53.320 --> 42:54.120
So you feel worse.

42:54.120 --> 42:55.960
In the end, you kill Haley Joel Osment.

42:58.760 --> 43:00.600
I wanna watch that movie.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.360
But that's the termination of it all.

43:02.360 --> 43:05.240
All the wickedness that you've been building up, it all dies with him.

43:05.240 --> 43:06.360
He dies for you.

43:06.360 --> 43:10.840
Haley Joel Osment died for all your minuscule sins, like he being $8 from-

43:10.840 --> 43:12.120
He was Pluto Jesus.

43:12.920 --> 43:14.120
He was Pluto Jesus.

43:14.120 --> 43:17.480
Do you think the way I'm talking right now, and I have been talking for the past two minutes,

43:17.480 --> 43:19.560
is like how all criminals got started?

43:21.560 --> 43:21.960
Why?

43:21.960 --> 43:24.120
Why and why did you murder that family?

43:24.120 --> 43:27.480
Because I lost my wallet at Cannon Park and never returned it in.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.160
Eight goddamn dollars.

43:29.160 --> 43:30.200
Eight goddamn dollars.

43:30.200 --> 43:34.520
I had to go to the DMV, pay like 35 bucks, take the fucking test over again.

43:34.520 --> 43:37.560
It like completely ruined my entire day over $8.

43:37.560 --> 43:39.240
It's not worth it.

43:39.240 --> 43:40.520
Apparently it ruined your life.

43:41.240 --> 43:42.600
You're a bitter human being.

43:43.240 --> 43:44.920
Yeah, you're really angry about this.

43:45.720 --> 43:48.040
Do we wanna do one more Yahoo question or should we wrap it up?

43:48.040 --> 43:48.840
We absolutely do.

43:48.840 --> 43:50.280
Okay, break me off something.

43:50.280 --> 43:50.920
You must have something.

43:50.920 --> 43:51.480
Oh, man.

43:51.480 --> 43:52.680
Oh, do I?

43:52.680 --> 43:55.400
This one was sent in by Shonin413.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.120
Thank you, Shonin.

43:57.720 --> 44:00.120
It's by Yahoo Answers user question mark.

44:00.120 --> 44:00.600
Who asks?

44:00.600 --> 44:05.160
Okay, I need to perform a colonoscopy to myself.

44:07.160 --> 44:11.080
I need a colonoscopy performed on me, but unfortunately in these economic times,

44:11.080 --> 44:12.600
I cannot afford a doctor.

44:12.600 --> 44:16.360
I'm pretty sure I could do it myself, but what should I get to perform?

44:17.560 --> 44:22.920
The only store near me is a Home Depot, so the tools need to be from there.

44:22.920 --> 44:24.280
What items should I get?

44:24.280 --> 44:27.320
I have a very low budget, so don't pick anything too expensive.

44:28.520 --> 44:30.360
You're gonna need a rubber hose.

44:30.360 --> 44:31.640
You're kind of tying our hands.

44:32.680 --> 44:39.000
I want a homemade colonoscopy, but I got maybe like eight bucks that I can drop on this.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.320
I found it in a wallet at Camden Park.

44:41.320 --> 44:43.160
I found it in a wallet at Camden Park, and now I'm gonna spend it on a butt camera.

44:43.160 --> 44:43.720
Can you help?

44:44.360 --> 44:52.600
Now, I can't imagine the kind of yoga one has to go into to operate a self-butt camera.

44:52.600 --> 44:57.080
The tech required is outrageous.

44:57.080 --> 45:01.720
I would say the smallest camera that I own is my iPhone 4, and even that is gonna be,

45:01.720 --> 45:03.240
if you'll forgive the term, a stretch.

45:07.240 --> 45:11.640
The thing that bothers me is not just that he doesn't just want to do a home one.

45:11.640 --> 45:14.120
He wants to do a home one on the cheap.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.000
You can't say, I'm gonna be cutting.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.800
Yeah, you're already cutting the biggest corner.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.800
There are no other corners to cut.

45:21.800 --> 45:23.160
It's like oblong now.

45:23.160 --> 45:25.240
You can't no longer cut corners.

45:25.240 --> 45:25.960
You're out of them.

45:25.960 --> 45:27.960
I'm all about pioneer spirit.

45:27.960 --> 45:29.480
I'm all about DIY.

45:29.480 --> 45:33.480
I'm all about looking up shit on the internet and then doing that shit without getting help

45:33.480 --> 45:40.040
from other people, but this is a bridge too far, dawg.

45:40.680 --> 45:41.880
Yeah, yeah, it is.

45:43.960 --> 45:45.000
I love value.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.760
Like everybody who knows me, they say, Justin Bargenhauer, that's what everybody calls me.

45:49.400 --> 45:50.360
This is too much.

45:50.360 --> 45:51.080
You've gone too far.

45:51.080 --> 45:56.280
And nine months ago before we started doing this show, I would have thought this was a joke,

45:56.280 --> 46:00.040
but reading the answers, it's a real concern.

46:00.840 --> 46:02.040
Yeah, it's a real concern.

46:02.680 --> 46:06.680
Take a flexible hollow half-inch diameter flex hose about two or three feet long.

46:08.360 --> 46:11.640
Take a webcam housing off around the lens and circuit board.

46:11.640 --> 46:14.840
Run a cable attached to webcam lens and circuit board through the hose.

46:14.840 --> 46:19.000
Insert circuit board into flex hose and mount camera lens even with the tip of a hose.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.600
Grind a flashlight lens down into the diameter of the hose.

46:25.640 --> 46:28.760
Plug your computer in and turn the webcam on.

46:28.760 --> 46:30.600
Ram the device up your ass and look for the-

46:30.600 --> 46:32.200
Step six, kill cell.

46:35.880 --> 46:41.400
Can I make a humble suggestion of maybe sell your fucking computer and get a colonoscopy?

46:41.400 --> 46:44.520
Like as long as we're leaking outside the box.

46:44.520 --> 46:49.400
Can we start a fundraising drive to get this dude to a colonoscopist?

46:49.400 --> 46:50.440
Why is this your-

46:50.440 --> 46:51.880
Why is that the plan?

46:51.880 --> 46:52.600
How about-

46:52.600 --> 46:54.920
How about what are some ways I can get some more money?

46:55.960 --> 46:58.840
I guarantee if you went to any doctor and said,

46:58.840 --> 47:03.640
I'm thinking about giving myself a self-colonoscopy unless you do it for free,

47:03.640 --> 47:05.240
the doctor will do it for free.

47:06.760 --> 47:11.240
I'm gonna hurt myself in my butt really bad if you do not come give me a hand here.

47:11.240 --> 47:14.440
I'm gonna give it to you straight, doc.

47:14.440 --> 47:17.720
You can either A. give me a free colonoscopy

47:17.720 --> 47:22.040
or B. dig a homemade colonoscopy camera out of my butt hole in two hours.

47:22.920 --> 47:23.880
You decide.

47:23.880 --> 47:25.560
This is how we're gonna get healthcare.

47:25.560 --> 47:27.960
This is how we're gonna get healthcare pushed through Congress.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.280
Everybody calls their local representative and says,

47:32.280 --> 47:38.680
hey, I'm about to irreversibly damage my rectal wall if you do not get this shit approved.

47:38.680 --> 47:39.480
Hey, Obama.

47:39.480 --> 47:41.160
Hey, Obama.

47:41.160 --> 47:42.200
I'm gonna hurt myself.

47:43.400 --> 47:44.680
This one's on you, bro.

47:44.680 --> 47:45.080
Yes.

47:45.080 --> 47:47.800
Yes, we can stick a webcam up our assholes.

47:48.920 --> 47:51.240
Good news, I appear to be cancer-free.

47:51.240 --> 47:53.880
Bad news, I'm never not defecating.

47:53.880 --> 47:56.680
Anytime you see me, I basically-

47:56.680 --> 48:00.920
I broke whatever flange or cap is supposed to be there.

48:02.840 --> 48:05.640
Dear Yahoo Answers, I'm never not defecating.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.320
Can you give me some homemade solutions?

48:07.320 --> 48:09.960
There's only a home depot near me.

48:09.960 --> 48:12.840
I need to be able to stop having boundaries at this point.

48:13.880 --> 48:17.160
But good news, I can Skype from my anus, which is pretty cool.

48:17.800 --> 48:19.160
That is really nice.

48:19.160 --> 48:21.160
I own a new hit website.

48:22.600 --> 48:26.760
Never not defecating is also my favorite podcast.

48:26.760 --> 48:27.720
It's one of my favorites.

48:30.120 --> 48:31.160
Jimmy Fardo, there.

48:33.480 --> 48:34.520
What do I care?

48:34.520 --> 48:35.640
What do I care?

48:35.640 --> 48:37.480
It was just right there, I'll just snatch it out.

48:38.520 --> 48:43.240
So this has been, my brother was so sorry.

48:43.240 --> 48:47.960
You came aboard, you trusted the recommendations of people who you've come to know and love

48:47.960 --> 48:50.360
over these years, and this is what it has gotten you.

48:50.360 --> 48:53.560
Maybe, if nothing else, you've learned a valuable lesson about trust.

48:53.560 --> 48:56.280
I want to hear Griffin's very last question that we'll use to finish the show, but

48:56.840 --> 48:57.960
some housekeeping stuff.

48:58.920 --> 49:01.400
You can always find us at mbnbam.com.

49:01.400 --> 49:02.760
We will always be there.

49:02.760 --> 49:05.640
There you can find all the methods for asking us questions.

49:06.840 --> 49:10.520
Mbnbam at gmail.com is our email address to get in contact with us.

49:11.640 --> 49:18.360
We have a Twitter account at mbnbam where you can ask us questions there, or you can,

49:18.360 --> 49:24.120
we love it when people tweet questions using the mbnbam hashtag without that at at the

49:24.120 --> 49:25.240
beginning so everybody can see it.

49:25.960 --> 49:29.960
Our quotes from the show, people like to do that sometimes, and we always really appreciate

49:29.960 --> 49:30.680
it.

49:30.680 --> 49:35.960
We have a forum spring, it's formspring.me forward slash mbnbam.

49:35.960 --> 49:40.520
We haven't mentioned it in a while, but we do have the phone number, which is, Griffin?

49:40.520 --> 49:43.480
It's 203-ma-bim-bam-1.

49:43.480 --> 49:48.040
So, real quick, so that's for the new folks.

49:48.040 --> 49:50.360
New folks, thank you so much for joining us.

49:50.360 --> 49:59.560
Please, if you like what you heard, subscribe on iTunes or, you know, I guess, Zune or whatever,

49:59.560 --> 50:05.640
Blackberry or whatever other methods you like to use to listen to your podcasts, and please

50:05.640 --> 50:06.680
come back next week.

50:07.320 --> 50:09.240
We put a new episode up every Monday.

50:10.280 --> 50:13.720
Very rarely do we miss one, so make sure you come out for that.

50:14.600 --> 50:16.200
You can also follow us on Twitter.

50:16.200 --> 50:17.400
I'm Justin McElroy.

50:18.040 --> 50:19.640
I'm Travis McElroy.

50:19.640 --> 50:22.520
And I'm Griffin McElroy, but you can always suss that out.

50:23.240 --> 50:24.520
Yeah, you probably sort that out yourself.

50:24.520 --> 50:29.480
So, people who've been with us before now, I know that it might seem, you might be a

50:29.480 --> 50:30.040
little worried.

50:30.920 --> 50:32.920
So, let me get the most important thing out first.

50:34.200 --> 50:35.560
Nothing's going to change.

50:35.560 --> 50:37.080
Everything's going to be the same.

50:37.080 --> 50:38.120
Except for everything.

50:39.800 --> 50:41.560
Nothing gold can stay, Ponyboy.

50:42.200 --> 50:44.200
Well, we did change the theme song.

50:44.200 --> 50:45.080
That did change.

50:45.880 --> 50:48.520
Yeah, that did change, but the show's going to stay the same.

50:49.560 --> 50:53.080
Our website, you will see, will move over to Maximum Fun.

50:53.080 --> 50:57.320
You'll still get to it through nbm.com, but we're going to move the website over there

50:57.320 --> 51:01.880
and the forums over there, which I know that's kind of like, oh, we've already been posting

51:01.880 --> 51:06.840
stuff, but everything can be the same there as it was.

51:06.840 --> 51:12.440
Our two families, there's so much overlap that I think that everyone's just going to

51:12.440 --> 51:13.400
get along really great.

51:13.400 --> 51:15.800
It's like cheaper by the dozen, right?

51:16.440 --> 51:17.240
It's like cheaper by the dozen.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.200
Or step by step.

51:18.200 --> 51:20.600
It's like step by, oh, that's so much better, Travis.

51:20.600 --> 51:21.000
Thank you.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.120
It's like step by step.

51:22.120 --> 51:22.760
You're welcome.

51:22.760 --> 51:24.440
And like our family-

51:24.440 --> 51:25.320
I call Cody.

51:25.320 --> 51:25.880
I'm Cody.

51:27.400 --> 51:32.440
We are the Patrick Fuck.

51:36.200 --> 51:37.320
Hi, I'm Patrick Fuck.

51:37.320 --> 51:39.240
You might have heard of me from the boosted hazards.

51:39.240 --> 51:40.680
What's that dude's name?

51:41.480 --> 51:42.360
Tom Wopat.

51:42.360 --> 51:42.600
No.

51:44.600 --> 51:45.560
Patrick Dempsey.

51:45.560 --> 51:46.840
Patrick, no, fuck.

51:46.840 --> 51:48.680
The guy from step by step, the dad.

51:48.680 --> 51:49.240
I know it.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.280
I just don't want to tell you.

51:50.280 --> 51:50.760
Duffy.

51:50.760 --> 51:51.000
Okay.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.680
We're the Duff and-

51:52.680 --> 51:56.520
We're the Patrick Duffy's and you are the Suzanne Sommers.

51:56.520 --> 51:57.000
Yeah.

51:57.000 --> 52:03.480
And we would like to welcome all of our new listeners that found us through maxfund.org

52:03.480 --> 52:08.680
and also all of our listeners that have never taken a chance to check out, you know, Jordan

52:08.680 --> 52:12.280
Just To Go or Sound of Young America or any of the other ones.

52:12.280 --> 52:15.000
Stop what you're doing right after you finish this podcast.

52:15.000 --> 52:15.240
Yeah.

52:15.240 --> 52:16.760
Run, don't walk and download.

52:16.760 --> 52:22.200
Don't walk and download, we got started doing podcasts because of listening to the Max Fund

52:22.200 --> 52:22.600
Network.

52:22.600 --> 52:26.680
So really go subscribe to all of their shows and listen to them.

52:26.680 --> 52:28.600
We promise we will not get jealous.

52:28.600 --> 52:30.200
We not like that.

52:30.200 --> 52:32.040
We have an open relationship with you.

52:33.400 --> 52:41.240
You're going to see, we're going to have new merch and stuff and all that will be revealed

52:41.240 --> 52:43.800
at a later point how we're going to be handling that.

52:43.800 --> 52:47.240
But because we don't know.

52:47.240 --> 52:53.000
Oh, and also we're going to start doing promotions on the show, which if you've heard other shows

52:53.000 --> 52:55.640
on the Maximum Fund Network, then you know how those work.

52:55.640 --> 52:59.720
If you want to do a personal or commercial message, we can definitely do that for you.

52:59.720 --> 53:06.040
If you want more details on price or how to get started, you can email Teresa at Maximum

53:06.040 --> 53:06.440
Fund.

53:06.440 --> 53:07.800
That's Teresa with an H.

53:07.800 --> 53:14.840
Uh, and, but it's not going to be, you know, like, uh, it's not going to impede your listening

53:14.840 --> 53:15.240
pleasure.

53:15.240 --> 53:15.720
No, no, no.

53:15.720 --> 53:17.160
Promise it won't be, it won't be an annoyance.

53:17.160 --> 53:19.400
We'll make it, we'll make it funny for you.

53:19.400 --> 53:20.680
Well, we'll, we'll have some laughs.

53:20.680 --> 53:22.360
Oh, don't worry about it.

53:22.360 --> 53:25.320
We made, we, we made a wedding proposal serious.

53:25.320 --> 53:28.120
There's a 50-50 chance it is not funny at all.

53:28.120 --> 53:31.880
So I'd say there's a 50-50 chance that we got fucking taken for a ride.

53:32.440 --> 53:32.920
You think?

53:32.920 --> 53:34.040
We got great, yeah.

53:34.040 --> 53:38.120
But if we didn't, congratulations, he's at home cuddling his brain wife.

53:39.640 --> 53:41.720
Don't use this to propose to your brain wife, please.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.720
If you have questions, this is not a joke.

53:45.720 --> 53:48.440
If you have questions, email us or concerns.

53:48.440 --> 53:49.720
You've been with us the whole time.

53:49.720 --> 53:52.120
You're worried about what, what, what the future holds.

53:52.680 --> 53:55.080
Uh, please email us.

53:55.080 --> 53:58.200
The only thing that we're probably not going to negotiate on is the music.

53:58.200 --> 53:59.000
Trust us, guys.

53:59.560 --> 54:02.520
We, that wouldn't be like, hey, they changed music.

54:02.520 --> 54:04.440
It would be like, what happened to Justin Travis?

54:04.440 --> 54:05.160
They're in jail.

54:06.280 --> 54:07.400
They're in Swiss jail.

54:07.400 --> 54:09.000
They were extradited immediately.

54:11.000 --> 54:11.960
So, so don't worry.

54:12.760 --> 54:13.480
Don't worry about that.

54:13.480 --> 54:17.400
But, uh, anything else, questions or concerns, um, or just congratulations.

54:17.400 --> 54:18.840
We, that's nice.

54:18.840 --> 54:21.400

54:21.400 --> 54:22.200
Shoot us a line.

54:22.200 --> 54:23.400
Let us know what's going on.

54:23.400 --> 54:24.760
Our call either way.

54:24.760 --> 54:30.760
And, um, thank you so much for your support over the months because it's been, it's really

54:30.760 --> 54:33.160
because of you guys, um, that we're still doing this.

54:33.160 --> 54:39.240
And the main reason we wanted to, to join up with Max Fun is just to expand to other

54:39.240 --> 54:43.320
people, introduce other people to the show, grow the family as it were.

54:43.320 --> 54:45.480
If you've seen the hit show, Sister Wives, it's basically like that.

54:45.480 --> 54:47.400
We're basically the newest sister wife.

54:47.400 --> 54:54.200
Um, but then again, on the new, the newest sister wife is the only one who's not, um,

54:54.200 --> 54:55.320
not gross looking.

54:55.320 --> 54:58.280
Not saying that that's a, that's a, that's a direct allegory to us.

54:58.280 --> 55:02.440
I'm just saying I just watched Sister Wives for the first time and man, holy shit.

55:02.440 --> 55:03.320
What a crazy show.

55:04.360 --> 55:08.440
That sentence, that sentence, that sentence for a ride.

55:08.440 --> 55:09.240
A good point.

55:09.240 --> 55:09.800
A good point.

55:09.800 --> 55:11.560
Hey, you guys ever seen Sister Wives?

55:12.520 --> 55:13.960
Hey, what's up with Sister Wives?

55:13.960 --> 55:17.400
Just last week for my sister wife, my sister wife and me.

55:17.400 --> 55:23.240
Uh, we're going to close out the show with, uh, a last question to sort of grow on and,

55:23.240 --> 55:27.000
and think about all over, uh, in the, in the ensuing week.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.240
Thank you to new friends and old.

55:29.240 --> 55:30.760
