00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.940 --> 00:49.940
It's better it's better

00:53.940 --> 00:55.940
It's better it's better

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:10.420 --> 01:15.820
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

01:15.820 --> 01:18.300
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:18.900 --> 01:26.500
Hello governor. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy, and I'm your sweet grown-up brother Griffin McElroy

01:26.540 --> 01:28.860
We're back in the saddle again

01:29.660 --> 01:31.660
Back states. I had this realization

01:32.260 --> 01:33.500
Yes

01:33.500 --> 01:39.340
That this was well we were on our hiatus. So we're the last episode we recorded would have been

01:40.700 --> 01:42.220
like

01:42.220 --> 01:47.020
October 13th, who can say that is the longest time I

01:47.580 --> 01:50.980
Have gone without recording an episode of my brother my brother and me

01:51.500 --> 01:53.500
since I was a

01:54.020 --> 01:56.020
30-year-old man since I was

01:56.660 --> 02:02.560
Sorry 29 years old. Yes, since I was 29. It's the longest I've ever gotten

02:03.180 --> 02:09.380
Gone with that. You're only 30. You're only 33 now nominal man. And what I realized is I

02:09.380 --> 02:15.300
I had been contextualizing bad stuff that happened to me in my life

02:15.980 --> 02:20.860
With like well, at least I'll be able to tell this story on the podcast

02:21.340 --> 02:24.980
Yeah, I see how when things happen guys

02:25.620 --> 02:32.020
Since we record our last episode, I spent two straight calendar days doing nothing

02:32.020 --> 02:39.340
But making 15 gallons of chili and then serving 30 gallons of chili now. Wait, hold on

02:40.020 --> 02:45.620
Sorry, that's not kind of loaves and fishes shit. Is that Justin you made 15 and then there were 30

02:47.020 --> 02:49.020
He cut it

02:52.180 --> 02:55.220
Water some water and some wood shavings

02:55.220 --> 03:02.260
Um, okay you my wife this is how long it's been my wife has forgotten

03:02.260 --> 03:05.620
This is just the sacred time

03:05.620 --> 03:06.540
I bet yeah

03:06.540 --> 03:14.220
I had some people also making chili Mary made like 15 gallons of chili and then I I served 30 gallons guys

03:15.180 --> 03:17.260
15 gallons of chili is so gross

03:19.060 --> 03:22.700
Yeah, and I feel like it's probably the worst with chili

03:22.700 --> 03:29.060
There's probably other foods, but like I always have these giant freezer bags and I would just like schlurp

03:31.260 --> 03:33.620
That's not the best way to move

03:36.660 --> 03:40.500
And then I'd have this big vat of chili that I'm stirring all day

03:40.500 --> 03:44.500
I'm stirring this frozen chili and then I'll take it over to the serving pot

03:44.500 --> 04:02.500
And then these people would watch me and I would beg them like first off take a step back because you were in the chili splash zone and then I said please don't watch this when you see this amount of food it's hugely appetizing and then I had to schlurp this hot boiling chili into a big pot

04:02.500 --> 04:12.100
That draws too much attention to what a shared experience that is and like feeding pigs that are trough, right? It's just like the comparison is too obvious at that point

04:12.100 --> 04:19.500
I wouldn't talk about this on a more politically minded podcast, but I think here I'm in safe company. Our booth was the Democrat

04:20.020 --> 04:26.860
Like County Democrats and then our booth is directly positioned across from the County Republicans. I mean direct

04:26.860 --> 04:27.660
Oh, that's nice

04:27.660 --> 04:36.620
And these dudes brought two full-size cardboard standups of my man DJ D

04:36.620 --> 04:43.620
My man DJ Trump was watching and presiding over the chili festivities over at their booth

04:43.620 --> 04:45.620
Known chili aficionado

04:45.620 --> 04:49.620
They didn't affix Donald

04:49.620 --> 04:52.620
He was thinking it was a windy day

04:52.620 --> 04:54.620
They didn't, hold on, oh no

04:54.620 --> 04:57.620
So Donald would just go flying

04:57.620 --> 04:59.620
He flat Stanley'd around everywhere

04:59.620 --> 05:00.620
That's fun

05:00.620 --> 05:01.620
He'd just go flying away, it was great

05:01.620 --> 05:10.620
Can I ask a question? Did they at least hang a sign on DJ Trump that said like yum yum chili time or yum yum I love chili

05:10.620 --> 05:13.620
Just standing like a gargoyle in silent approval of the chili

05:13.620 --> 05:16.620
Bad president, good chili eater boy

05:16.620 --> 05:24.620
We started serving at 11 and they were done by 12 and it turned out they had only brought one pot of chili

05:24.620 --> 05:26.620
New

05:26.620 --> 05:31.620
And it's like guys, you brought one pot of chili

05:31.620 --> 05:34.620
That's the same way they think about politics

05:34.620 --> 05:37.620
Yes thank you, thank you Travis

05:37.620 --> 05:40.620
They're like one pot

05:40.620 --> 05:44.620
They brought one pot of chili and two Donald Trumps

05:44.620 --> 05:47.620
Listen, I don't want to tell you your business but

05:47.620 --> 05:49.620
Maybe half the Trumps twice the chili

05:49.620 --> 05:55.620
Then one of the dudes came over to our booth and was like do you have a cup

05:55.620 --> 06:01.620
He said do you have a cup and luckily another candidate had provided cups with his logo on them

06:01.620 --> 06:05.620
So I gave him one and he said thanks I got to skim all this grease off the top

06:05.620 --> 06:07.620
It's like boy that sounds good

06:07.620 --> 06:09.620
That sounds like good stuff right there

06:09.620 --> 06:13.620
Seems like you guys really poured your heart and soul into this chili

06:13.620 --> 06:17.620
I was hoping that you were going to say like they came over and they're like hey guys

06:17.620 --> 06:20.620
Could we have some of your chili to give away

06:20.620 --> 06:23.620
You seem to have a lot of chili like the ants in that one story

06:23.620 --> 06:25.620
And we're like the grasshoppers in that story

06:25.620 --> 06:30.620
And if you could give us some of your chili to give to potential voters and say that we made it

06:30.620 --> 06:32.620
That would just be great

06:32.620 --> 06:37.620
Yeah I've had a while, I drove a truck in a parade

06:37.620 --> 06:39.620
Oh Justin

06:39.620 --> 06:41.620
Yeah it was like the whole

06:41.620 --> 06:45.620
I mean I went to a castle and stuff but no go on about your chili and your car in a parade

06:45.620 --> 06:49.620
The thing is we know all about your castle Travis

06:49.620 --> 06:52.620
I went to like three castles dude

06:52.620 --> 06:54.620
Like three castles

06:54.620 --> 06:56.620
Were they all really different

06:56.620 --> 06:59.620
No they were basically like big stone buildings

06:59.620 --> 07:01.620
Yeah sure

07:01.620 --> 07:03.620
It never really got wild with the architecture

07:03.620 --> 07:06.620
Like I walk around my neighborhood now and I'm like that building looks different

07:06.620 --> 07:09.620
Oh look that's like a mid-century monument

07:09.620 --> 07:13.620
And like castles man they pretty much did just like squared off stone buildings

07:13.620 --> 07:15.620
How were the buttresses though

07:15.620 --> 07:17.620
Flying

07:17.620 --> 07:19.620
Wow and the battle men

07:19.620 --> 07:21.620
Oh yeah it was there

07:21.620 --> 07:23.620
The portcullis forget about it

07:23.620 --> 07:25.620
What about the Bailey

07:25.620 --> 07:27.620
The Bailey it was old

07:27.620 --> 07:29.620
It was one old Bailey

07:29.620 --> 07:31.620
Yeah it's been a while

07:31.620 --> 07:35.620
I've been thinking a lot about elevating my brand in the last two weeks

07:35.620 --> 07:37.620
Oh okay

07:37.620 --> 07:40.620
Like and this is true I think for all of us

07:40.620 --> 07:43.620
And I've been meaning to talk to you guys about this for a while

07:43.620 --> 07:46.620
So maybe this isn't the show but

07:46.620 --> 07:49.620
I think we're grown up adult men

07:49.620 --> 07:51.620
I think we're grown up people

07:51.620 --> 07:54.620
And there's a vibe of

07:54.620 --> 07:58.620
Specifically me I think because I have put toys in my mouth before

07:58.620 --> 08:02.620
That I'm like some sort of boy still

08:02.620 --> 08:06.620
But I like I have a mortgage and two children

08:06.620 --> 08:10.620
And so I've been thinking about like having my brand instead be like

08:10.620 --> 08:12.620
Grown up responsible

08:12.620 --> 08:16.620
Because it's all true it's just not the face

08:16.620 --> 08:18.620
That it's not the public facing

08:18.620 --> 08:20.620
It's also not as funny or interesting

08:20.620 --> 08:23.620
It's like well maybe not Travis but

08:23.620 --> 08:27.620
It's real and I think people want real shit now

08:27.620 --> 08:31.620
So I'm like Janus flipping the mask around

08:31.620 --> 08:33.620
Oh and now the guy on Grey Brays

08:33.620 --> 08:35.620
Griffin has two faces

08:35.620 --> 08:40.620
And so now the goofball who eats toys

08:40.620 --> 08:42.620
And bananas

08:42.620 --> 08:44.620
Talks about like toilet humor and stuff like that

08:44.620 --> 08:46.620
Like he's in the back now

08:46.620 --> 08:48.620
And then up front is

08:48.620 --> 08:50.620
Grown up Griffin McElroy

08:50.620 --> 08:53.620
I care deeply about grown up stuff

08:53.620 --> 08:57.620
Can you give me an example of something that you care more about than you did

08:57.620 --> 09:00.620
I mean just publicly care more about

09:00.620 --> 09:02.620
Publicly I care more about than two weeks ago?

09:02.620 --> 09:04.620
Yeah part of this new rebrand

09:04.620 --> 09:06.620
The new Griffin experience

09:06.620 --> 09:09.620
Like if you were going to say now I care about blank instead of Pokemon

09:09.620 --> 09:11.620
Yeah I would say sort of like

09:11.620 --> 09:13.620
Moisturizing

09:13.620 --> 09:15.620
I'm huge on that shit now

09:15.620 --> 09:17.620
I realized that I wasn't wet enough

09:17.620 --> 09:19.620
Ever basically

09:19.620 --> 09:21.620
Have you gone into serums?

09:21.620 --> 09:23.620
Serums I do

09:23.620 --> 09:25.620
I have a salve

09:25.620 --> 09:27.620
I have an ungent that I apply

09:27.620 --> 09:29.620
On every full moon

09:29.620 --> 09:32.620
And that really is what keeps me going

09:32.620 --> 09:34.620
There's a lot a lot

09:34.620 --> 09:36.620
A lot of placenta in that one

09:36.620 --> 09:38.620
But it keeps it tight

09:38.620 --> 09:40.620
And very very very damp

09:40.620 --> 09:42.620
Wait are you using plenty of centa?

09:42.620 --> 09:44.620
Cause I've been using plenty of centa

09:44.620 --> 09:48.620
I've been using plenty of centa since the day I turned 29 years old

09:48.620 --> 09:50.620
Yeah I can tell

09:50.620 --> 09:52.620
Cause that's when things really start to drop off

09:52.620 --> 09:54.620
But the plenty of centa tightens, dampens

09:54.620 --> 09:56.620
Revives, revitalizes

09:56.620 --> 09:59.620
And even now I can tell I'm getting silly again

09:59.620 --> 10:01.620
You know what I mean?

10:01.620 --> 10:04.620
It's work, it's work to elevate your brand

10:04.620 --> 10:06.620
But like you know

10:06.620 --> 10:08.620
Do you guys know what I'm saying?

10:08.620 --> 10:10.620
I feel out on a branch right now

10:10.620 --> 10:12.620
No I feel like my brand is solid

10:12.620 --> 10:15.620
And everybody is just really in favor of it

10:15.620 --> 10:18.620
I don't feel like there's any holes in my brand

10:18.620 --> 10:20.620
People often lift me up and say like

10:20.620 --> 10:22.620
Hey Travis I notice that like

10:22.620 --> 10:24.620
You seem to be like the best

10:24.620 --> 10:26.620
And like most adjusted of the three

10:26.620 --> 10:28.620
And the most like just completely

10:28.620 --> 10:30.620
I think the word is neuro virgin

10:30.620 --> 10:32.620
I think is what it is

10:32.620 --> 10:34.620
You're just a real neuro virgin guy

10:34.620 --> 10:36.620
Yeah that's what they definitely say

10:36.620 --> 10:38.620
Yeah yeah yeah

10:38.620 --> 10:40.620
Justin anything you want to say about your brand?

10:40.620 --> 10:42.620
How's your brand Juice?

10:42.620 --> 10:44.620
Mine's pretty well fucked at this point

10:44.620 --> 10:46.620
You know what I mean?

10:46.620 --> 10:48.620
I've done enough stuff where

10:48.620 --> 10:50.620
I don't know that I have much of a brand anymore

10:50.620 --> 10:52.620
I feel like I've kind of ruined my

10:52.620 --> 10:54.620
You know what I think it was?

10:54.620 --> 10:56.620
What was it Juice?

10:56.620 --> 10:58.620
It was becoming a notary public

10:58.620 --> 11:00.620
Yeah you think that's

11:00.620 --> 11:02.620
Oh Juice that's an inspiration for me

11:02.620 --> 11:04.620
For me that's like

11:04.620 --> 11:06.620
Once I hit that point

11:06.620 --> 11:08.620
I'm like once I'm a notary public

11:08.620 --> 11:10.620
And a sommelier

11:10.620 --> 11:12.620
Then I'm for real

11:12.620 --> 11:14.620
Done I have put my childish things

11:14.620 --> 11:16.620
Way the fuck behind me now

11:16.620 --> 11:18.620
Because I can sign government documents and shit

11:18.620 --> 11:20.620
But I think if I may

11:20.620 --> 11:22.620
In terms of what Justin is saying to us

11:22.620 --> 11:24.620
Griffin what you're talking about is like a redirection

11:24.620 --> 11:26.620
Of your brand and what I think Justin is saying is

11:26.620 --> 11:28.620
His brand became so dispersed

11:28.620 --> 11:30.620
Between everything that he's doing all at once

11:30.620 --> 11:32.620
That you cannot

11:32.620 --> 11:34.620
Pin down one thing about Justin

11:34.620 --> 11:36.620
It's like oh do you mean the guy

11:36.620 --> 11:38.620
Who like is a notary public

11:38.620 --> 11:40.620
And is Count Donut

11:40.620 --> 11:42.620
Like those two things together

11:42.620 --> 11:44.620
Like Janus the mask it flips Travis

11:44.620 --> 11:46.620
Yes but it's like if his mask had

11:46.620 --> 11:48.620
Like 162 faces

11:48.620 --> 11:50.620
I think is the problem

11:50.620 --> 11:52.620
You know what it is? I'm a modern renaissance man

11:52.620 --> 11:54.620
That's exactly it

11:54.620 --> 11:56.620
That's a good brand

11:56.620 --> 11:58.620
Way up there

11:58.620 --> 12:00.620
Extremely elevated

12:00.620 --> 12:02.620
I like to think that my brand is like

12:02.620 --> 12:04.620
Just lazy cult leader

12:04.620 --> 12:06.620
Who can do it but who can be bothered

12:06.620 --> 12:08.620
That's kind of what I'm going for

12:08.620 --> 12:10.620
The beard has been bad for my brand too

12:10.620 --> 12:12.620
I think so in a major way

12:12.620 --> 12:14.620
Okay good I just want to make sure

12:14.620 --> 12:16.620
Good for your face

12:16.620 --> 12:18.620
You know what

12:18.620 --> 12:20.620
It has allowed me to sort of

12:20.620 --> 12:22.620
Insert myself

12:22.620 --> 12:24.620
Into certain dad circles that I would not

12:24.620 --> 12:26.620
Be welcomed into

12:26.620 --> 12:28.620
Because while they might be able to

12:28.620 --> 12:30.620
Talk about sports and stuff

12:30.620 --> 12:32.620
If I see one of them's got a beard

12:32.620 --> 12:34.620
I'm in

12:34.620 --> 12:36.620
You want to talk about beards? Of course you do

12:36.620 --> 12:38.620
That's all you think about

12:38.620 --> 12:40.620
Oh just me? Okay good good

12:40.620 --> 12:42.620
It's way cheaper than buying an ebike

12:42.620 --> 12:44.620
Like I had to do to fit in with the

12:44.620 --> 12:46.620
Cool city dads here in DC

12:46.620 --> 12:48.620
Who do fucking wheelies and stunts

12:48.620 --> 12:50.620
I don't get dads

12:50.620 --> 12:52.620
Now we're not even doing the show anymore

12:52.620 --> 12:54.620
We haven't talked in like half a month

12:54.620 --> 12:56.620
What I don't get

12:56.620 --> 12:58.620
Because I realized this recently

12:58.620 --> 13:00.620
If you're a full blown dad joke dad

13:00.620 --> 13:02.620
You gotta dye your hair

13:02.620 --> 13:04.620
To a different color because the dad jokes

13:04.620 --> 13:06.620
The number of people were like

13:06.620 --> 13:08.620
I love your hair and I'm like thanks

13:08.620 --> 13:10.620
I love it too but I hate ruining pillowcases

13:10.620 --> 13:12.620
The number of like just straight up

13:12.620 --> 13:14.620
That's not so much a dad joke as much as it is

13:14.620 --> 13:16.620
That's not so much a dad joke as much as it is

13:16.620 --> 13:18.620
Just like a thing that is true and I think

13:18.620 --> 13:20.620
Annoying about hair color

13:20.620 --> 13:22.620
I'll give you

13:22.620 --> 13:24.620
I did a pumpkin carving contest

13:24.620 --> 13:26.620
That I was the MC for

13:26.620 --> 13:28.620
Man Justin your life

13:28.620 --> 13:30.620
Has just gotten off the

13:30.620 --> 13:32.620
Is this season two of your life

13:32.620 --> 13:34.620
And they're just like we gotta ramp up the vids

13:34.620 --> 13:36.620
This does feel like that break in Battlestar

13:36.620 --> 13:38.620
Where they come back three years later

13:38.620 --> 13:40.620
And it was like this is the mirror

13:40.620 --> 13:42.620
Why

13:42.620 --> 13:44.620
Thank you Travis

13:44.620 --> 13:46.620
I had a pumpkin suit

13:46.620 --> 13:48.620
On like

13:48.620 --> 13:50.620
Mr. Pumpkins did

13:50.620 --> 13:52.620
But it wasn't a David Pumpkins costume

13:52.620 --> 13:54.620
It was just a pumpkin suit

13:54.620 --> 13:56.620
And people would be like I love your costume

13:56.620 --> 13:58.620
Thanks I had a wedding earlier today

13:58.620 --> 14:00.620
Oh that's good

14:00.620 --> 14:02.620
That's really good stuff Juice

14:02.620 --> 14:04.620
I like that

14:04.620 --> 14:06.620
Should we do the questions

14:06.620 --> 14:08.620
I got a lot of like

14:08.620 --> 14:10.620
I got some Munch stuff

14:10.620 --> 14:12.620
Munch related stuff to talk about

14:12.620 --> 14:14.620
I'm excited

14:14.620 --> 14:16.620
Is it too late to change the name of the bit to Munch stuff

14:16.620 --> 14:18.620
I just like the way

14:18.620 --> 14:20.620
It's uncomfortable in my mouth

14:20.620 --> 14:22.620
As long as we're elevating the brand

14:22.620 --> 14:24.620
This is Justin McElroy's Munch My Stuff

14:24.620 --> 14:26.620
Munch My Stuff

14:26.620 --> 14:28.620
It can be like an old

14:28.620 --> 14:30.620
Playstation video game intro

14:30.620 --> 14:32.620
Munch My Stuff

14:32.620 --> 14:34.620
And if it's a thing that

14:34.620 --> 14:36.620
Makes you really mad you can say like

14:36.620 --> 14:38.620
This house my munch

14:38.620 --> 14:40.620
This really munches my stuff

14:40.620 --> 14:42.620
Oh yeah yeah yeah

14:42.620 --> 14:44.620
So let's do a question

14:44.620 --> 14:46.620
I just had a baby last month

14:46.620 --> 14:48.620
And all my friends and family say

14:48.620 --> 14:50.620
He's adorable I obviously think so too

14:50.620 --> 14:52.620
However due to all the baby hormones

14:52.620 --> 14:54.620
I'm not sure my judgement can be trusted

14:54.620 --> 14:56.620
What if I'm just surrounded by liars

14:56.620 --> 14:58.620
How can I tell if my baby is really cute

14:58.620 --> 15:00.620
Or if people are just lying to me

15:00.620 --> 15:02.620
And that's from Cute Fuse in Chicago

15:02.620 --> 15:04.620
Travis was there an image attached

15:04.620 --> 15:06.620
Well no they specifically said

15:06.620 --> 15:08.620
They didn't want us to like

15:08.620 --> 15:10.620
Be biased by an image

15:10.620 --> 15:12.620
Because this isn't about our judgement

15:12.620 --> 15:14.620
On whether the baby is cute or not

15:14.620 --> 15:16.620
Because how would they know to trust us

15:16.620 --> 15:18.620
This is about how can they trust us

15:18.620 --> 15:20.620
They should know that I don't care

15:20.620 --> 15:22.620
That's also a good point

15:22.620 --> 15:24.620
I want most folks to know that when you ask my opinion

15:24.620 --> 15:26.620
On most things and you're not

15:26.620 --> 15:28.620
An immediate family member of mine

15:28.620 --> 15:30.620
You're gonna get the gosh darn honest truth

15:30.620 --> 15:32.620
Because

15:32.620 --> 15:34.620
I mean you need to be mirrored

15:34.620 --> 15:36.620
Don't we all need to be mirrored

15:36.620 --> 15:38.620
That's an interesting point Griffin

15:38.620 --> 15:40.620
Because I would have said I would lie to strangers

15:40.620 --> 15:42.620
And be honest with my family

15:42.620 --> 15:44.620
No come on

15:44.620 --> 15:46.620
No because I get to see you guys like all the time

15:46.620 --> 15:48.620
And we work together like all the time

15:48.620 --> 15:50.620
And if I say like a bad thing to you

15:50.620 --> 15:52.620
About you that I felt for a long time

15:52.620 --> 15:54.620
Then like uh oh

15:54.620 --> 15:56.620
Next recording time uh oh

15:56.620 --> 15:58.620
But if I see a stranger

15:58.620 --> 16:00.620
With a busted looking baby

16:00.620 --> 16:02.620
Then like you know

16:02.620 --> 16:04.620
I can let them know that and then they can take the necessary

16:04.620 --> 16:06.620
Steps to beautify

16:06.620 --> 16:08.620
That baby

16:08.620 --> 16:10.620
Step up the game get a flipper in there

16:10.620 --> 16:12.620
Hair extension something

16:12.620 --> 16:14.620
Listen people lie

16:14.620 --> 16:16.620
You know who doesn't lie

16:16.620 --> 16:18.620
Is animals

16:18.620 --> 16:20.620
If your animals are reacting to your baby like

16:20.620 --> 16:22.620
Like a Disney princess birds landing on their shoulder

16:22.620 --> 16:24.620
Dogs wanna lick their faces

16:24.620 --> 16:26.620
I think it's safe to say that's a cute baby

16:26.620 --> 16:28.620
Cute is a human reaction though

16:28.620 --> 16:30.620
Like we don't

16:30.620 --> 16:32.620
If animals don't have like cute

16:32.620 --> 16:34.620
Instincts

16:34.620 --> 16:36.620
Excuse me sir

16:36.620 --> 16:38.620
Like your baby's cute for a baby cat

16:38.620 --> 16:40.620
But not cute for a human

16:40.620 --> 16:42.620
Yeah that's fair

16:42.620 --> 16:44.620
Well then why are dogs and cats always putting on

16:44.620 --> 16:46.620
Cute outfits huh if they don't have like cute instincts huh

16:46.620 --> 16:48.620
Think about that Justin

16:48.620 --> 16:50.620
Actually I'm hoisted by my own pertard on that

16:50.620 --> 16:52.620
Thank you

16:52.620 --> 16:54.620
I think

16:54.620 --> 16:56.620
All babies are

16:56.620 --> 16:58.620
Cute like

16:58.620 --> 17:00.620
No no well hold on even the ones that

17:00.620 --> 17:02.620
Even the ones that aren't

17:02.620 --> 17:04.620
Like

17:04.620 --> 17:06.620
Traditionally

17:06.620 --> 17:08.620
Handsome babies

17:08.620 --> 17:10.620
They're still like they're really

17:10.620 --> 17:12.620
Really little and they can't do

17:12.620 --> 17:14.620
Anything right

17:14.620 --> 17:16.620
And that part's great I agree that that's great

17:16.620 --> 17:18.620
Their vulnerability definitely wins me over

17:18.620 --> 17:20.620
They're so little and they fuck up

17:20.620 --> 17:22.620
Non stop and they

17:22.620 --> 17:24.620
Just like piss and shit

17:24.620 --> 17:26.620
Like whenever they want to

17:26.620 --> 17:28.620
That's like

17:28.620 --> 17:30.620
That's big cutie behavior if you ask me

17:30.620 --> 17:32.620
And frankly for me and listen I might be in the minority

17:32.620 --> 17:34.620
Here but I like me a Wallace

17:34.620 --> 17:36.620
Sean looking baby you know what I mean

17:36.620 --> 17:38.620
It's ideal for me

17:38.620 --> 17:40.620
Give me a baby with a tonsure

17:40.620 --> 17:42.620
Oh yeah

17:42.620 --> 17:44.620
Just a little

17:44.620 --> 17:46.620
Shiny fontanelle

17:46.620 --> 17:48.620
Sometimes you see a baby

17:48.620 --> 17:50.620
Trying too hard and it's like yeah man

17:50.620 --> 17:52.620
I get it you're conventionally

17:52.620 --> 17:54.620
Attractive for a baby

17:54.620 --> 17:56.620
Alright okay

17:56.620 --> 17:58.620
I'm gonna blow this one wide open

18:00.620 --> 18:02.620
You can't trust people

18:02.620 --> 18:04.620
To tell you the honest truth about

18:04.620 --> 18:06.620
Your baby there is only one force

18:06.620 --> 18:08.620
That we can turn to at times like this

18:08.620 --> 18:10.620
It's capitalism

18:10.620 --> 18:12.620
Here's what I want you to do I need you to take that baby

18:12.620 --> 18:14.620
To Los Angeles, California

18:14.620 --> 18:16.620
And you are gonna put your money

18:16.620 --> 18:18.620
Where your mouth is and you're gonna start

18:18.620 --> 18:20.620
Pushing that baby

18:20.620 --> 18:22.620
You need to become a baby agent

18:22.620 --> 18:24.620
I recommend baby Joel Begley

18:24.620 --> 18:26.620
He's just like our agent but a baby

18:26.620 --> 18:28.620
And go to him and say

18:28.620 --> 18:30.620
I gotta take my shot

18:30.620 --> 18:32.620
And then you just start cranking it

18:32.620 --> 18:34.620
If that baby's really cute

18:34.620 --> 18:36.620
You're gonna start booking

18:36.620 --> 18:38.620
And that is the only thing you can trust

18:38.620 --> 18:40.620
Is your baby booking

18:40.620 --> 18:42.620
Yep because this is also a good chance

18:42.620 --> 18:44.620
Listen your baby might be cute right

18:44.620 --> 18:46.620
Being cute is easy but

18:46.620 --> 18:48.620
This is also a good chance to figure out is your baby driven

18:48.620 --> 18:50.620
Because it's like Baby Rock said

18:50.620 --> 18:52.620
It's about drive

18:52.620 --> 18:54.620
It's about drive

18:54.620 --> 18:56.620
It's about power

18:56.620 --> 18:58.620
When you feel hungry

18:58.620 --> 19:00.620
With the vowel

19:00.620 --> 19:02.620
Wait for the inevitable

19:02.620 --> 19:04.620
Full house reboot

19:04.620 --> 19:06.620
When they open the roll up for

19:06.620 --> 19:08.620
You know baby

19:08.620 --> 19:10.620
Like Michelle would probably be a dinosaur

19:10.620 --> 19:12.620
Or something like whatever

19:12.620 --> 19:14.620
And then you come for that

19:14.620 --> 19:16.620
Crown and let's see how cute your baby is

19:16.620 --> 19:18.620
Let's see how cute

19:18.620 --> 19:20.620
The baby auditions for fullest house

19:20.620 --> 19:22.620
Are going to be

19:22.620 --> 19:24.620
It's going to be the hunger games

19:24.620 --> 19:26.620
I have quintuplets they can each work 15 minutes

19:26.620 --> 19:28.620
Swamp them out as needed

19:28.620 --> 19:30.620
You know what we can go through them

19:30.620 --> 19:32.620
Work one so bad

19:32.620 --> 19:34.620
You can keep one

19:34.620 --> 19:36.620
Keep one that's yours

19:36.620 --> 19:38.620
We have a PA who runs in and swaps

19:38.620 --> 19:40.620
The baby out mid scene

19:40.620 --> 19:42.620
Mid scene

19:42.620 --> 19:44.620
No cuts

19:44.620 --> 19:46.620
We have one of these quintuplets we only use for lighting

19:46.620 --> 19:48.620
So we just put the baby there

19:48.620 --> 19:50.620
So we don't have to get one of the really choice babies

19:50.620 --> 19:52.620
To stand out

19:52.620 --> 19:54.620
Yeah we got a close up baby

19:54.620 --> 19:56.620
We got a back of the headshot baby

19:56.620 --> 19:58.620
My name is Derek

19:58.620 --> 20:00.620
I thought I was working with Skylar today

20:00.620 --> 20:02.620
Derek I'm just running your lines

20:02.620 --> 20:04.620
They're going to shoot me from behind the head

20:04.620 --> 20:06.620
I look just like beautiful Skylar

20:06.620 --> 20:08.620
I'm here for the two shots

20:08.620 --> 20:10.620
Don't worry about it

20:10.620 --> 20:12.620
Hey let's bang through this

20:12.620 --> 20:14.620
Okay it's martini o'clock

20:14.620 --> 20:16.620
Let's see we got some ADR here

20:16.620 --> 20:18.620
Okay

20:18.620 --> 20:20.620
Let me take that again

20:20.620 --> 20:22.620
That didn't feel natural

20:22.620 --> 20:24.620
I'm a mocap for my brother

20:24.620 --> 20:26.620
Derek

20:26.620 --> 20:28.620
Please ignore all the white balls glued to my face

20:28.620 --> 20:30.620
It's hard for me to because I'm a baby and what not

20:30.620 --> 20:32.620
I'm just going to swing at this tennis ball

20:32.620 --> 20:34.620
Hang in front of me

20:34.620 --> 20:36.620
Pretend it's I don't know a fun toy

20:36.620 --> 20:38.620
That a beautiful baby would get

20:38.620 --> 20:40.620
And I did eat it

20:40.620 --> 20:42.620
One of the balls

20:42.620 --> 20:44.620
Please call my mommy and my doctor

20:44.620 --> 20:46.620
Apologies to Robert Zemeckis that we have

20:46.620 --> 20:48.620
Backed into

20:48.620 --> 20:50.620
Baby Herman from

20:50.620 --> 20:52.620
Frame Roger Rabbit just back character

20:52.620 --> 20:54.620
Again

20:54.620 --> 20:56.620
Hey can we go to the wizards

20:56.620 --> 20:58.620
House

20:58.620 --> 21:00.620
This one was sent in by Zach

21:00.620 --> 21:02.620
I want to knock first

21:02.620 --> 21:04.620
Knock knock knock

21:04.620 --> 21:06.620
Well the door just swung open

21:06.620 --> 21:08.620
And a bat flew out

21:08.620 --> 21:10.620
And the bat is the wizard

21:10.620 --> 21:12.620
This is the wiki how it's how to blow a

21:12.620 --> 21:14.620
Kiss how to blow a kiss

21:14.620 --> 21:16.620
Just because it's Halloween it doesn't mean

21:16.620 --> 21:18.620
We can't have a little

21:18.620 --> 21:20.620
Valentine's Day in here don't you think

21:20.620 --> 21:22.620
I think Halloween is like couples costumes

21:22.620 --> 21:24.620
And group costumes and

21:24.620 --> 21:26.620
Friends becoming lovers

21:26.620 --> 21:28.620
Lovers becoming wolves

21:32.620 --> 21:34.620
Blowing a kiss is a great way to show affection for

21:34.620 --> 21:36.620
Someone in a light hearted way

21:36.620 --> 21:38.620
Remember to lock eyes with the person while blowing

21:38.620 --> 21:40.620
Them a kiss always choose an appropriate

21:40.620 --> 21:42.620
Time to blow kisses and avoid making

21:42.620 --> 21:44.620
This gesture to anyone who might not like it which

21:44.620 --> 21:46.620
I will say statistically

21:46.620 --> 21:48.620
Speaking is

21:48.620 --> 21:50.620
Everyone

21:50.620 --> 21:52.620
If you were to take the statistics

21:52.620 --> 21:54.620
Of the human population which I think is like

21:54.620 --> 21:56.620
8 some billion

21:56.620 --> 21:58.620
Right and then you take

21:58.620 --> 22:00.620
Out of that number

22:00.620 --> 22:02.620
The number of people that it's okay

22:02.620 --> 22:04.620
For you to blow a kiss to it is so

22:04.620 --> 22:06.620
Statistically insignificant that

22:06.620 --> 22:08.620
It is zero

22:08.620 --> 22:10.620
For all intents and purposes

22:10.620 --> 22:12.620
It's the lottery ticket of human interaction

22:12.620 --> 22:14.620
They're just like once in a while once in a

22:14.620 --> 22:16.620
Great while it might hit

22:16.620 --> 22:18.620
A little bit and that's probably because the person thought

22:18.620 --> 22:20.620
You were someone else that kind of looks like

22:20.620 --> 22:22.620
You I blew a kiss

22:22.620 --> 22:24.620
I blew a kiss to my baby today because he clocked

22:24.620 --> 22:26.620
Me while I was taking Henry to school

22:26.620 --> 22:28.620
And he was at the window

22:28.620 --> 22:30.620
And I gave him a little and then I

22:30.620 --> 22:32.620
Thought like was that right

22:32.620 --> 22:34.620
Yeah

22:34.620 --> 22:36.620
Did I do that?

22:36.620 --> 22:38.620
What kind of look did he give back to you?

22:38.620 --> 22:40.620
I mean he smiled he loves

22:40.620 --> 22:42.620
He really is a big fan of me

22:42.620 --> 22:44.620
Was it a smile like oh dad that wasn't

22:44.620 --> 22:46.620
The time for that yeah it was pretty fucking

22:46.620 --> 22:48.620
Condescending actually now that I'm thinking about it

22:48.620 --> 22:50.620
So anyway making the gesture

22:50.620 --> 22:52.620
I'm hung up though on the

22:52.620 --> 22:54.620
Lighthearted gesture and I'm wondering

22:54.620 --> 22:56.620
If there's like a way that one could

22:56.620 --> 22:58.620
Dramatically blow a kiss

22:58.620 --> 23:00.620
Like either in a threatening way

23:00.620 --> 23:02.620
Or like this means something kind of

23:02.620 --> 23:04.620
You know like when you see in like mafia movies and they get that

23:04.620 --> 23:06.620
Like kiss of death could you do that

23:06.620 --> 23:08.620
With blowing a kiss where it's just like hey you

23:08.620 --> 23:10.620
Mwah

23:10.620 --> 23:12.620
Oh no it's the black spot

23:12.620 --> 23:14.620
What? I don't think that gets it done

23:14.620 --> 23:16.620
I don't think this is a lighthearted if you take

23:16.620 --> 23:18.620
Lighthearted at face value to mean like something that's just

23:18.620 --> 23:20.620
Kind of like woo playful and a

23:20.620 --> 23:22.620
Little poof a little poof of smoke

23:22.620 --> 23:24.620
Blowing a kiss is not

23:24.620 --> 23:26.620
That because I'm going to be thinking about that all day

23:26.620 --> 23:28.620
If someone does that to me but let's make sure

23:28.620 --> 23:30.620
We're doing it right please wait until

23:30.620 --> 23:32.620
You are a short distance away from the person

23:32.620 --> 23:34.620
Blowing a kiss is a nonverbal show of affection

23:34.620 --> 23:36.620
That works best when you're a short distance away from

23:36.620 --> 23:38.620
Someone e.g. across the room if you blow

23:38.620 --> 23:40.620
Someone a kiss at close proximity

23:40.620 --> 23:42.620
It may seem odd and unnecessary

23:42.620 --> 23:44.620
That's true some

23:44.620 --> 23:46.620
Some close quarters combat

23:46.620 --> 23:48.620
But what's the farthest that's such a vague

23:48.620 --> 23:50.620
That's a great that's the next

23:50.620 --> 23:52.620
Question is like I feel like I could

23:52.620 --> 23:54.620
360 no scope my baby

23:54.620 --> 23:56.620
With a

23:56.620 --> 23:58.620
Remote smoocher like

23:58.620 --> 24:00.620
From across like a crowded theater

24:00.620 --> 24:02.620
And I feel like I have done that

24:02.620 --> 24:04.620
I think one end of an end zone to end zone of a football

24:04.620 --> 24:06.620
Field clear line of sight

24:06.620 --> 24:08.620
I could get them

24:08.620 --> 24:10.620
The line of sight is important

24:10.620 --> 24:12.620
It can't be full of people right because then

24:12.620 --> 24:14.620
Unless I can stand up like on one of those bandstands

24:14.620 --> 24:16.620
That like you know that the drum

24:16.620 --> 24:18.620
Line leaders use and stuff like if I could get that

24:18.620 --> 24:20.620
I think I could get them into this you don't want it to hit

24:20.620 --> 24:22.620
Someone else no god no

24:22.620 --> 24:24.620
Are you kidding me yeah in this

24:24.620 --> 24:26.620
Economy this one's important

24:26.620 --> 24:28.620
Lock eyes with the person you're blowing a kiss to making

24:28.620 --> 24:30.620
Direct eye contact with blowing a kiss let's the person

24:30.620 --> 24:32.620
Know you're sending it to them

24:32.620 --> 24:34.620
Look at the person until they look back at you and

24:34.620 --> 24:36.620
Smile when they meet your gaze hold that eye contact

24:36.620 --> 24:38.620
While you blow them a kiss if they break

24:38.620 --> 24:40.620
Eye contact before you make the gesture wait until they

24:40.620 --> 24:42.620
Look back at you to try again

24:42.620 --> 24:44.620
In front of your mouth like yeah

24:44.620 --> 24:46.620
It's like a oh so it's like

24:46.620 --> 24:48.620
Um it's like tipping at the

24:48.620 --> 24:50.620
Deli you gotta wait

24:50.620 --> 24:52.620
They have to wait until they see they gotta

24:52.620 --> 24:54.620
Wait till they're looking like hello here you go yeah

24:54.620 --> 24:56.620
Um

24:56.620 --> 24:58.620
I can't think of anything worse

24:58.620 --> 25:00.620
Than somebody leaving you

25:00.620 --> 25:02.620
Hanging on a kiss blow

25:02.620 --> 25:04.620
That's gotta be a tough that's gotta be a

25:04.620 --> 25:06.620
Tough one to just turn away

25:06.620 --> 25:08.620
In the middle like I'm like

25:08.620 --> 25:10.620
And they turn away in the middle

25:10.620 --> 25:12.620
Of it and then it's like someone else

25:12.620 --> 25:14.620
Sees me blowing a kiss to

25:14.620 --> 25:16.620
Nobody to a ghost well it's

25:16.620 --> 25:18.620
Just like playing catch with someone without that eye

25:18.620 --> 25:20.620
Contact you blow the kiss when they're not

25:20.620 --> 25:22.620
Looking hits them right inside of the head they're down

25:22.620 --> 25:24.620
I mean they're unconscious

25:24.620 --> 25:26.620
I just had a freaking grand idea

25:26.620 --> 25:28.620
If you're listening to this show

25:28.620 --> 25:30.620
And you see us in the real

25:30.620 --> 25:32.620
World

25:32.620 --> 25:34.620
Just blow us a sweet kiss

25:34.620 --> 25:36.620
Wow that's interesting if you blow us a

25:36.620 --> 25:38.620
Big bold move and I clock

25:38.620 --> 25:40.620
It no it's not bold

25:40.620 --> 25:42.620
Well both of you do include your two brothers

25:42.620 --> 25:44.620
Who didn't get a vote in this new idea

25:44.620 --> 25:46.620
Yeah I feel like and this is one of those

25:46.620 --> 25:48.620
Things that is like the secret on the

25:48.620 --> 25:50.620
Show but for bad but for bad

25:50.620 --> 25:52.620
Like if there was a secret that was

25:52.620 --> 25:54.620
For bad that was like when you say

25:54.620 --> 25:56.620
It the bad thing is going to happen now

25:56.620 --> 25:58.620
It's like the it's like the

25:58.620 --> 26:00.620
That's what you've done

26:00.620 --> 26:02.620
I mean that don't just start indiscriminately

26:02.620 --> 26:04.620
But I'm like I'm saying

26:04.620 --> 26:06.620
Here's my consent to just like blowing

26:06.620 --> 26:08.620
Me a kiss anytime you see me and I'll

26:08.620 --> 26:10.620
I'll know your whole story

26:10.620 --> 26:12.620
Yeah I'll get it and then just be like

26:12.620 --> 26:14.620
You'll be completely comfortable knowing that

26:14.620 --> 26:16.620
I've just like I caught it with my hand

26:16.620 --> 26:18.620
I smooshed it on my cheek thank you so much

26:18.620 --> 26:20.620
Now here's what I will say Justin from

26:20.620 --> 26:22.620
That gesture it's just occurred to me

26:22.620 --> 26:24.620
That there is not a I guess maybe a thumbs

26:24.620 --> 26:26.620
Up but like blowing a kiss seems

26:26.620 --> 26:28.620
Intimate in a way of like kissing

26:28.620 --> 26:30.620
On the cheek would be as opposed to like

26:30.620 --> 26:32.620
A high five can we long distance high

26:32.620 --> 26:34.620
Five as a thing to replace

26:34.620 --> 26:36.620
Look at yourself do it again Travis

26:36.620 --> 26:38.620
Oh yeah no I did it no I did it

26:38.620 --> 26:40.620
And I felt it no I'm not doing it

26:40.620 --> 26:42.620
Again ever again in my life

26:42.620 --> 26:44.620
High five is bad

26:44.620 --> 26:46.620
Bad bad bad

26:46.620 --> 26:48.620
Historically speaking while you're driving

26:48.620 --> 26:50.620
Historically speaking not great

26:50.620 --> 26:52.620
Not a great look

26:52.620 --> 26:54.620
How do you guys receive a

26:54.620 --> 26:56.620
Kiss blow you catch it you put in your

26:56.620 --> 26:58.620
Pocket

26:58.620 --> 27:00.620
See I like to I like to make my

27:00.620 --> 27:02.620
Kiss bust up because when they blow me a kiss

27:02.620 --> 27:04.620
I'll grab it out of the air and I'll fucking eat it

27:04.620 --> 27:06.620
Oh that's a good one

27:06.620 --> 27:08.620
It's a sweet little candy

27:08.620 --> 27:10.620
Yeah it's like no I get like I'm like a beast

27:10.620 --> 27:12.620
I'm like

27:12.620 --> 27:14.620
It's filling me up good

27:14.620 --> 27:16.620
Kiss your palm slowly bring the palm

27:16.620 --> 27:18.620
To your hand to your mouth touch your palm with your lips

27:18.620 --> 27:20.620
I don't think that's right it's

27:20.620 --> 27:22.620
Fingertips it's not palm

27:22.620 --> 27:24.620
For me this is where I got

27:24.620 --> 27:26.620
Fucked up when I blew a kiss to Gus today

27:26.620 --> 27:28.620
Is I did it very

27:28.620 --> 27:30.620
Very much on the fingertips

27:30.620 --> 27:32.620
I rolled it off there I rolled it

27:32.620 --> 27:34.620
Oh now that's it oh

27:34.620 --> 27:36.620
Griffin I'm sure we'll get to this but when

27:36.620 --> 27:38.620
I hear blow kiss

27:38.620 --> 27:40.620
Well I don't blow I'm sure there are people

27:40.620 --> 27:42.620
Who and

27:42.620 --> 27:44.620
And like waft it off

27:44.620 --> 27:46.620
If you don't send it on its merry way

27:46.620 --> 27:48.620
Yeah how the kiss is supposed to get to them

27:48.620 --> 27:50.620
I'm sending it

27:50.620 --> 27:52.620
People are gonna think you got some delicious marinara on there

27:52.620 --> 27:54.620
I'm sending it right

27:54.620 --> 27:56.620
With my energy but I'm not blowing

27:56.620 --> 27:58.620
Travis oh that's interesting

27:58.620 --> 28:00.620
If you look at your kiss

28:00.620 --> 28:02.620
I know Justin

28:02.620 --> 28:04.620
I know Justin I can feel it too

28:04.620 --> 28:06.620
Historically

28:06.620 --> 28:08.620
The way you're doing your hand with flinging your kisses

28:08.620 --> 28:10.620
Looks bad historically

28:10.620 --> 28:12.620
That's why I'm doing it backhanded now instead of

28:12.620 --> 28:14.620
Maybe throw him a grounder

28:14.620 --> 28:16.620
Travis you know what I mean

28:16.620 --> 28:18.620
A slider right between your

28:18.620 --> 28:20.620
Arms

28:20.620 --> 28:22.620
I'll put it in a little envelope

28:22.620 --> 28:24.620
And I'll seal it and I'll put it in an imaginary

28:24.620 --> 28:26.620
And then they can open it and it's safe

28:26.620 --> 28:28.620
That way

28:28.620 --> 28:30.620
Position your hand after kissing your palm place your hand flat under your mouth

28:30.620 --> 28:32.620
We know this one you gotta have a stable firing

28:32.620 --> 28:34.620
Platform but here's step 5

28:34.620 --> 28:36.620
Blow away the imaginary kiss

28:36.620 --> 28:38.620
This motion will signify you blowing the kiss to its intended target

28:38.620 --> 28:40.620
Do this gesture slowly

28:40.620 --> 28:42.620
To create emphasis

28:42.620 --> 28:44.620
I think that's the thing

28:44.620 --> 28:46.620
That's most threatening because if I was

28:46.620 --> 28:48.620
Close to that person right and we have

28:48.620 --> 28:50.620
A relationship like physically or emotionally

28:50.620 --> 28:52.620
Both

28:52.620 --> 28:54.620
You know if it was someone where we had a relationship

28:54.620 --> 28:56.620
Where we kiss each other on a regular basis

28:56.620 --> 28:58.620
I would feel comfortable kissing them

28:58.620 --> 29:00.620
What I would not do is kiss them and then

29:00.620 --> 29:02.620
Blow against their lips to cement

29:02.620 --> 29:04.620
That kiss in there

29:04.620 --> 29:06.620
Like a kiss on the cheek so like

29:06.620 --> 29:08.620
I'm sending the kiss

29:08.620 --> 29:10.620
You know that that's not

29:10.620 --> 29:12.620
My kiss is like a butterfly

29:12.620 --> 29:14.620
It flies on its own me blowing on it

29:14.620 --> 29:16.620
It's just gonna fuck up its trajectory

29:16.620 --> 29:18.620
That's crazy

29:18.620 --> 29:20.620
Your kiss can't fly on its own

29:20.620 --> 29:22.620
My kiss is a fucking butterfly

29:22.620 --> 29:24.620
I don't know about you guys lead balloon

29:24.620 --> 29:26.620
Kisses sorry your kisses suck

29:26.620 --> 29:28.620
Be mindful about your cultural

29:28.620 --> 29:30.620
Surroundings this is good

29:30.620 --> 29:32.620
I think in general

29:32.620 --> 29:34.620
Hey all wiki however step 1

29:34.620 --> 29:36.620
Step 1 keep your grades up

29:36.620 --> 29:38.620
Step 2 be mindful of your cultural

29:38.620 --> 29:40.620
Surroundings

29:40.620 --> 29:42.620
Blowing your kiss is a gesture

29:42.620 --> 29:44.620
That's well understood in North American culture but not necessarily

29:44.620 --> 29:46.620
In others in Brazil for instance

29:46.620 --> 29:48.620
The gesture of bringing your fingers to your mouth

29:48.620 --> 29:50.620
As you kiss them signifies the enjoyment

29:50.620 --> 29:52.620
Of a meal and not a sign of affection

29:52.620 --> 29:54.620
This to me seems like

29:54.620 --> 29:56.620
That's still okay like

29:56.620 --> 29:58.620
If you're in Brazil and you blow someone a kiss

29:58.620 --> 30:00.620
Someone will look at you and be like

30:00.620 --> 30:02.620
They must have eaten something very delicious

30:02.620 --> 30:04.620
Lately that's not so bad

30:04.620 --> 30:06.620
If it was like

30:06.620 --> 30:08.620
You wish that their you know

30:08.620 --> 30:10.620
That their whole family was sick

30:10.620 --> 30:12.620
Or something like that like that's what this

30:12.620 --> 30:14.620
This is a cursing this is a cursing gesture

30:14.620 --> 30:16.620
And I think as we've established earlier

30:16.620 --> 30:18.620
On in this segment there's definitely

30:18.620 --> 30:20.620
Some gestures you could make that are universally

30:20.620 --> 30:22.620
Unpleasant right that everyone's like

30:22.620 --> 30:24.620
There's no confusing that for anything else

30:24.620 --> 30:26.620
Choose an appropriate time and place

30:26.620 --> 30:28.620
Yeah I mean don't get

30:28.620 --> 30:30.620
Not a funeral

30:30.620 --> 30:32.620
Blowing a kiss is often

30:32.620 --> 30:34.620
Seen as a flirtatious gesture

30:34.620 --> 30:36.620
Which can be problematic in the workplace

30:36.620 --> 30:38.620
Yes in fact I would say

30:38.620 --> 30:40.620
It can be problematic in a

30:40.620 --> 30:42.620
Workplace any workplace

30:42.620 --> 30:44.620
Any workplace you don't have to work

30:44.620 --> 30:46.620
At the workplace if you are at the workplace

30:46.620 --> 30:48.620
Then it's not good

30:48.620 --> 30:50.620
And also the place what's the name

30:50.620 --> 30:52.620
Of the thing that connects all the workplaces

30:52.620 --> 30:54.620
Outside the world don't

30:54.620 --> 30:56.620
Do it there either cause that one can also

30:56.620 --> 30:58.620
Like somebody might be working nearby

30:58.620 --> 31:00.620
The only place not to do it is

31:00.620 --> 31:02.620
Well I mean unless I'm there

31:02.620 --> 31:04.620
Which I've already consented to blow all

31:04.620 --> 31:06.620
The kisses you like other than that

31:06.620 --> 31:08.620
Just like not inside a

31:08.620 --> 31:10.620
Workplace and not outside a workplace

31:10.620 --> 31:12.620
Other than that those two

31:12.620 --> 31:14.620
Situations

31:14.620 --> 31:16.620
I think there's two people

31:16.620 --> 31:18.620
I can think of that I would feel comfortable doing this to

31:18.620 --> 31:20.620
And neither of them

31:20.620 --> 31:22.620
Are you guys or my wife

31:22.620 --> 31:24.620
So my friends Bob and Bradberry

31:24.620 --> 31:26.620
I think Bob and Bradberry we could be like hey buddy what's up

31:26.620 --> 31:28.620
How's it going like and be very comfortable

31:28.620 --> 31:30.620
It's cool

31:30.620 --> 31:32.620
Like it's a cool thing

31:32.620 --> 31:34.620
That would be like a cool feeling very

31:34.620 --> 31:36.620
Hip way to do it I would not make a

31:36.620 --> 31:38.620
Show of it I think there's something in the show

31:38.620 --> 31:40.620
Like mwah

31:40.620 --> 31:42.620
Right where it's just like you fucking

31:42.620 --> 31:44.620
But if you're just like hey man stay classy

31:44.620 --> 31:46.620
Or whatever I think I could pull that off I think I could

31:46.620 --> 31:48.620
Do that I do it to my little stinkers

31:48.620 --> 31:50.620
That's it oh yeah yep

31:50.620 --> 31:52.620
I've started doing this thing and it

31:52.620 --> 31:54.620
Like it makes me feel

31:54.620 --> 31:56.620
Once again like a cool dad

31:56.620 --> 31:58.620
Where like I'll make a drugs

31:58.620 --> 32:00.620
They're awesome and I put my hat on back once I talk

32:00.620 --> 32:02.620
To my kids look how great they are it works great

32:02.620 --> 32:04.620
Hey kids let's talk about drugs

32:04.620 --> 32:06.620
Have you tried it you know

32:06.620 --> 32:08.620
You got any know where I can get them

32:08.620 --> 32:10.620
Sure I will make a joke

32:10.620 --> 32:12.620
Like for my three year old like maybe

32:12.620 --> 32:14.620
For lunch we should have a bowl of farts and

32:14.620 --> 32:16.620
Dot last but I wink at BB

32:16.620 --> 32:18.620
As if to say like you know we wouldn't

32:18.620 --> 32:20.620
Really eat farts and she like looks at me

32:20.620 --> 32:22.620
And nods and I'm like yeah man we're cool

32:22.620 --> 32:24.620
I want to bring back the wink

32:24.620 --> 32:26.620
Is that something that we can like reincorporate

32:26.620 --> 32:28.620
No for sure not

32:28.620 --> 32:30.620
No damn it I thought

32:30.620 --> 32:32.620
We could but you know what you guys are right

32:32.620 --> 32:34.620
And also

32:34.620 --> 32:36.620
The last tip here is make sure the person

32:36.620 --> 32:38.620
Won't be uncomfortable which like

32:38.620 --> 32:40.620
Should have been first of all the first

32:40.620 --> 32:42.620
Tip also impossible also

32:44.620 --> 32:46.620
I would just err on the side of caution

32:46.620 --> 32:48.620
Which is to say don't blow a kiss

32:48.620 --> 32:50.620
Unless it's to one of your little stinkers

32:50.620 --> 32:52.620
Or to a dog

32:52.620 --> 32:54.620
Or someone you have told I'm going

32:54.620 --> 32:56.620
To blow a kiss at you is that

32:56.620 --> 32:58.620
Do you mind then that

32:58.620 --> 33:00.620
Could be okay right I think you would

33:00.620 --> 33:02.620
Have to you would have to phrase it like

33:02.620 --> 33:04.620
At some point I would like to try to blow

33:04.620 --> 33:06.620
A kiss at you that's cool and I'm totally

33:06.620 --> 33:08.620
Fine if we do it and then

33:08.620 --> 33:10.620
You're like never do that again are

33:10.620 --> 33:12.620
You willing to try this exchange

33:12.620 --> 33:14.620
At least once to see how we both feel

33:14.620 --> 33:16.620
I don't know that I couldn't give blanket

33:16.620 --> 33:18.620
Consent to it like Justin has

33:18.620 --> 33:20.620
As we are introducing this into

33:20.620 --> 33:22.620
This sort of like social consciousness

33:22.620 --> 33:24.620
Of our

33:24.620 --> 33:26.620
Cultural surroundings

33:26.620 --> 33:28.620
We have an opportunity here to

33:28.620 --> 33:30.620
Kind of like set the rules because we are

33:30.620 --> 33:32.620
On the cutting edge we're pioneers

33:32.620 --> 33:34.620
So like first order of business

33:34.620 --> 33:36.620
For me we've discussed

33:36.620 --> 33:38.620
Technique right like get to the fingers

33:38.620 --> 33:40.620
You gotta blow

33:40.620 --> 33:42.620
Stable firing platform all that stuff

33:42.620 --> 33:44.620
Yeah absolutely big thing for me

33:44.620 --> 33:46.620
Sound is

33:46.620 --> 33:48.620
Necessary is it

33:48.620 --> 33:50.620
Is it creepier for me to go

33:50.620 --> 33:52.620
Or is it creepier for me to go

33:52.620 --> 33:54.620
I think silent

33:54.620 --> 33:56.620
Is weird well but see then we're getting

33:56.620 --> 33:58.620
Into sign language that is

33:58.620 --> 34:00.620
Thank you

34:00.620 --> 34:02.620
And I think it's an inch

34:02.620 --> 34:04.620
Lower with the fingers and no sound

34:04.620 --> 34:06.620
Right the only way to make it clear

34:06.620 --> 34:08.620
That what I'm saying is I'm kissing you

34:08.620 --> 34:10.620
And I'm blowing it at your face is like

34:10.620 --> 34:12.620
Okay and then the receiving

34:12.620 --> 34:14.620
End of it I think just a nod

34:14.620 --> 34:16.620
Just like

34:16.620 --> 34:18.620
Or a gentle touch of the cheek

34:18.620 --> 34:20.620
Like a breeze well no no no no no

34:20.620 --> 34:22.620
Because I don't know because I wouldn't

34:22.620 --> 34:24.620
Kiss you on the cheek do you know what I mean

34:24.620 --> 34:26.620
Like I wouldn't kiss you on the cheek I'm your brother

34:26.620 --> 34:28.620
No I wouldn't kiss

34:28.620 --> 34:30.620
I wouldn't kiss you hairy boys on your hairy cheeks

34:30.620 --> 34:32.620
Oh it's lovely it's like

34:32.620 --> 34:34.620
Nuzzling a big bear it's not lovely

34:34.620 --> 34:36.620
I'm not gonna kiss you guys hairy cheeks

34:36.620 --> 34:38.620
Stop it oh boy stop it

34:38.620 --> 34:40.620
So like I don't wanna address

34:40.620 --> 34:42.620
I don't want it to be I don't want it to land

34:42.620 --> 34:44.620
On me like I don't wanna

34:44.620 --> 34:46.620
I don't want it to land

34:46.620 --> 34:48.620
On me and me be the one that put it there

34:48.620 --> 34:50.620
Do you know what I mean so just a

34:50.620 --> 34:52.620
A new look and like a

34:52.620 --> 34:54.620
Like just curl your fingers

34:54.620 --> 34:56.620
And a nod like I want something of like it's been

34:56.620 --> 34:58.620
Oh that's cool that can be like a

34:58.620 --> 35:00.620
Cool gesture of just like you

35:00.620 --> 35:02.620
Sort of like your David Bowie

35:02.620 --> 35:04.620
With the oar oh yeah I've welcomed

35:04.620 --> 35:06.620
This I've got the kiss now

35:06.620 --> 35:08.620
And you can kind of like play with it and roll it around

35:08.620 --> 35:10.620
Your fingers like a coin oh

35:10.620 --> 35:12.620
Yeah do tricks with the kiss

35:12.620 --> 35:14.620
Oh I like that just a catch and a

35:14.620 --> 35:16.620
Nod what do you think Justin's thinking about

35:16.620 --> 35:18.620
I don't know man David Bowie

35:18.620 --> 35:20.620
No you find the guys

35:20.620 --> 35:22.620
There's contact juggling that's settled

35:22.620 --> 35:24.620
On blowing kisses that's all done

35:24.620 --> 35:26.620
We've weighed in on that and I think it's time to

35:26.620 --> 35:28.620
Treat ourselves with a quick trip

35:28.620 --> 35:30.620
To the money zone

35:38.620 --> 35:40.620
Can I tell you guys something messed up

35:40.620 --> 35:42.620
The whole time I was in the UK

35:42.620 --> 35:44.620
I didn't receive one letter

35:44.620 --> 35:46.620
No one sent me any letters

35:46.620 --> 35:48.620
As I bounced from castle to castle

35:48.620 --> 35:50.620
Just cleansing them of

35:50.620 --> 35:52.620
Every wrongdoing that's ever been done there

35:52.620 --> 35:54.620
I didn't receive one stinking

35:54.620 --> 35:56.620
Letter from either of you were you sending them

35:56.620 --> 35:58.620
No

35:58.620 --> 36:00.620
You know I was going to

36:00.620 --> 36:02.620
But I actually don't have the time to go to the

36:02.620 --> 36:04.620
Post office right now oh

36:04.620 --> 36:06.620

36:06.620 --> 36:08.620
That's the only place where stamps are so

36:08.620 --> 36:10.620
Sorry Justin

36:10.620 --> 36:12.620
Idiot is a word

36:12.620 --> 36:14.620

36:14.620 --> 36:16.620
To mean like somebody who doesn't know something

36:16.620 --> 36:18.620

I am not convinced stamps.com

38:08.620 --> 38:10.620
That your service is going to

38:10.620 --> 38:12.620
Make my evenings any

38:12.620 --> 38:14.620
Any quieter oh

38:14.620 --> 38:16.620
So griffin actually it's buried deep in the

38:16.620 --> 38:18.620
Contracts so be careful that's why it's important you read everything

38:18.620 --> 38:20.620
Yeah when you sign up with

38:20.620 --> 38:22.620
Stamps.com it does require at least one

38:22.620 --> 38:24.620
Night a week you watch a quiet place and

38:24.620 --> 38:26.620
Act it out oh wow

38:26.620 --> 38:28.620
And not make any sound now I've never

38:28.620 --> 38:30.620
Seen a quiet place except that I know that people

38:30.620 --> 38:32.620
Are really quiet in it and I think Jim from

38:32.620 --> 38:34.620
The office is in there pulling faces constantly

38:34.620 --> 38:36.620
Yeah and you could also

38:36.620 --> 38:38.620
Probably just get by watching the office on mute

38:38.620 --> 38:40.620
If that's what you wanted to do instead

38:40.620 --> 38:42.620
They don't have any way of checking up on you

38:42.620 --> 38:44.620
That's what I found out

38:44.620 --> 38:46.620
You guys see a quiet place

38:46.620 --> 38:48.620
What's it about I have not

38:48.620 --> 38:50.620
Seen that one yet um

38:50.620 --> 38:52.620
Yeah it's one of those movies where you have to

38:52.620 --> 38:54.620
Pay the dead kid tax at the top

38:54.620 --> 38:56.620
Of it in order to enjoy the rest of the film

38:56.620 --> 38:58.620
Yeah I wish there was a website

38:58.620 --> 39:00.620
Just for that there's one about whether dogs

39:00.620 --> 39:02.620
Die I really like that

39:02.620 --> 39:04.620
Because that could really soil a film for me

39:04.620 --> 39:06.620
Yeah like I don't have a dog

39:06.620 --> 39:08.620
Yeah right yeah

39:08.620 --> 39:10.620
For sure you know what I do

39:10.620 --> 39:12.620
Have what do you have a fresh

39:12.620 --> 39:14.620
Look

39:14.620 --> 39:16.620
All the time yeah how do I

39:16.620 --> 39:18.620
Do it a lot of people ask me what's my secret

39:18.620 --> 39:20.620
I'm a busy guy you know what's

39:20.620 --> 39:22.620

Rare fair you put them back in the

39:56.620 --> 39:58.620
Bag you ship them back no

Postage no fees no returns

40:00.620 --> 40:02.620
No problem no can I tell you my

40:02.620 --> 40:04.620
My favorite thing Justin oh I love this

40:04.620 --> 40:06.620
Happens from time to time where I'll get some

40:06.620 --> 40:08.620
From Citrix and it's something I would not have

40:08.620 --> 40:10.620
Picked out in a store yeah but I put it

40:10.620 --> 40:12.620
On and I'm like oh this

40:12.620 --> 40:14.620
Fixed me perfectly and looks great on me I

40:14.620 --> 40:16.620
Never would have known this is my thing

40:16.620 --> 40:18.620
But my stylist is like geared it towards

40:18.620 --> 40:20.620
Me and push that a little bit and

40:20.620 --> 40:22.620
I'm like yeah this is a new style that I love

40:22.620 --> 40:24.620
My wardrobe needs have changed and so I

40:24.620 --> 40:26.620
Drop back on my stitch fix

40:26.620 --> 40:28.620
To like a like quarterly

40:28.620 --> 40:30.620
Fix which works for me

40:30.620 --> 40:32.620
And my schedule but

40:32.620 --> 40:34.620
Also like I find that I've learned how to dress

40:34.620 --> 40:36.620
Myself because of stitch fix

40:36.620 --> 40:38.620
And the many many many clothes they

40:38.620 --> 40:40.620
Have sent my way getting an adult in the room

40:40.620 --> 40:42.620
To say hey hey is what you should

40:42.620 --> 40:44.620
Do yeah and that's also

40:44.620 --> 40:46.620
Nice to have an adult here to teach you how

40:46.620 --> 40:48.620
Like the buttons work because

40:48.620 --> 40:50.620
I can't figure out is this a hook and eye

40:50.620 --> 40:52.620
Situation what are we doing

40:52.620 --> 40:54.620
Yeah and my stylist walks me through

40:54.620 --> 40:56.620
Dressing myself and it's very lovely

40:56.620 --> 40:58.620
When you reach for something that you think will look

40:58.620 --> 41:00.620
Good on you but nobody else does

41:00.620 --> 41:02.620
Stitch fix is at the store when you don't have any help

41:02.620 --> 41:04.620
Stitch fix is like the hand that reaches out

41:04.620 --> 41:06.620
And smacks your hand and says no that's not

41:06.620 --> 41:08.620
For you this isn't that's not yours

41:08.620 --> 41:10.620
And it's the only rough

41:10.620 --> 41:12.620
Part was when stitch fix kicked in the door to my house

41:12.620 --> 41:14.620
And took away all my cargo

41:14.620 --> 41:16.620
Shorts and graphic tees with Stewie Griffin

41:16.620 --> 41:18.620
On them and you said

41:18.620 --> 41:20.620
Stuff in those in those cargo shorts

41:20.620 --> 41:22.620
And in the Stewie t-shirts

41:22.620 --> 41:24.620
Because they have pockets and I kept

41:24.620 --> 41:26.620
All my beyblades in those and

41:26.620 --> 41:28.620
In the Stewie Griffin t-shirts

41:28.620 --> 41:30.620
Anyway that's the only bad thing

41:30.620 --> 41:32.620
Is they'll take your cargo pants right out of your

41:32.620 --> 41:34.620
Your house and also if you have

41:34.620 --> 41:36.620
Any of the Family Guy guys

Uh yeah completely. Our

42:52.620 --> 42:54.620
Silly show is 15

42:54.620 --> 42:56.620
Years old. That makes it old enough to

42:56.620 --> 42:58.620
Get its learners permanent. And

42:58.620 --> 43:00.620
Almost old enough to get the talk

43:00.620 --> 43:02.620
Wow I hope you got the talk before then

43:02.620 --> 43:04.620
A lot of things have changed in 15

43:04.620 --> 43:06.620
Years. Our show's not one of them

43:06.620 --> 43:08.620
We're never changing and

43:08.620 --> 43:10.620
You can't make us

Pour one out super quick

43:58.620 --> 44:00.620
I don't wanna do a story

44:00.620 --> 44:02.620
About this but the McRib is guys on its

44:02.620 --> 44:04.620

44:06.620 --> 44:08.620
Moment and

44:08.620 --> 44:10.620
And I'm like why now

44:10.620 --> 44:12.620
You know what I mean like why now and are you

44:12.620 --> 44:14.620
Really gonna get rid of it

44:14.620 --> 44:16.620
Right now and then I

44:16.620 --> 44:18.620
Do you guys ever wonder where it goes when it's not here

44:18.620 --> 44:20.620
I think about that all the time

44:20.620 --> 44:22.620
Back to pigs

44:22.620 --> 44:24.620
The pigs get them

44:24.620 --> 44:26.620
Pigs get to keep them

44:26.620 --> 44:28.620
Keep your ribs

44:28.620 --> 44:30.620
We don't need them

44:30.620 --> 44:32.620
These are yours no

44:32.620 --> 44:34.620
Oh no the clown is here for our ribs

44:34.620 --> 44:36.620

44:38.620 --> 44:40.620
Keep your ribs today

44:40.620 --> 44:42.620
So I just wanted to tell you guys real quick

44:42.620 --> 44:44.620
What's happening out in the world

44:44.620 --> 44:46.620
Firehouse has released the prime

44:46.620 --> 44:48.620
Rib steak sub

44:48.620 --> 44:50.620
That's where they go

44:50.620 --> 44:52.620
The five star flavor

44:52.620 --> 44:54.620
This five star flavor comes from

44:54.620 --> 44:56.620
Being seared and then cooked to perfection

44:56.620 --> 44:58.620
Via sous vide

44:58.620 --> 45:00.620
I know they use

45:00.620 --> 45:02.620
Wait isn't this a fast casual

45:02.620 --> 45:04.620
Restaurant yes they

45:04.620 --> 45:06.620
Sous vide them and then let it sit

45:06.620 --> 45:08.620
Just kick it here for four hours

45:08.620 --> 45:10.620
While we bake your sandwich

45:10.620 --> 45:12.620
I'm sure they started before the customer gets there

45:12.620 --> 45:14.620
Griffin I don't think it's sous vide to order

45:14.620 --> 45:16.620
Yeah it's fair

45:16.620 --> 45:18.620
Now why sous vide

45:18.620 --> 45:20.620
Well let's check in with Berthelon

45:20.620 --> 45:22.620
A Michelin star trained

45:22.620 --> 45:24.620
Chef and a matre

45:24.620 --> 45:26.620
Cousineur de France

45:26.620 --> 45:28.620
Who's been a pioneer in sous vide since

45:28.620 --> 45:30.620
1989 Chef

45:30.620 --> 45:32.620
Gerard

45:32.620 --> 45:34.620
Hello is this Chef Gerard

45:34.620 --> 45:36.620
Berthelon

45:36.620 --> 45:38.620
It's Firehouse Subs

45:38.620 --> 45:40.620
You want to cook up a lot of these sloppy boys

45:40.620 --> 45:42.620
Or what

45:42.620 --> 45:44.620
Absolutely

45:44.620 --> 45:46.620
He says water is the best medium

45:46.620 --> 45:48.620
To transfer heat because of how precise

45:48.620 --> 45:50.620
It allows you to be

45:50.620 --> 45:52.620
By searing Firehouse Subs prime rib to capture

45:52.620 --> 45:54.620
Flavor and then cooking it for 12 hours

45:54.620 --> 45:56.620
Sous vide

45:56.620 --> 45:58.620
Guests receive an incredibly tender and flavorful piece of

45:58.620 --> 46:00.620
Beef just as good as they would get in any

46:00.620 --> 46:02.620
Steakhouse in the world

46:02.620 --> 46:04.620
Berthelon drunk on his own

46:04.620 --> 46:06.620
Now I also

46:06.620 --> 46:08.620
Say Firehouse Subs I don't know how much

46:08.620 --> 46:10.620
You paid this man to say this I could have told

46:10.620 --> 46:12.620
You the same thing for like 50 bucks

46:12.620 --> 46:14.620
I would have done it I've been sous vide eating

46:14.620 --> 46:16.620
For like six years now I could have told you the same

46:16.620 --> 46:18.620
It's good the water keeps it up real good

46:18.620 --> 46:20.620
Yeah it's pretty good

46:20.620 --> 46:22.620
I don't know I've been in the back

46:22.620 --> 46:24.620
Room of plenty of fast casual restaurants

46:24.620 --> 46:26.620
Enough to know that it's going to be

46:26.620 --> 46:28.620
Sort of a spooky thing to have back

46:28.620 --> 46:30.620
There it's going to just have like this

46:30.620 --> 46:32.620
Specimen floating in a fucking

46:32.620 --> 46:34.620
Bacta tank just like

46:34.620 --> 46:36.620
Waiting for you to just sear it

46:36.620 --> 46:38.620
And slice it up I think

46:38.620 --> 46:40.620
That that would give a sort of but it's Halloween

46:40.620 --> 46:42.620
It's Halloween

46:42.620 --> 46:44.620
Now see I thought you were going to say a spooky thing

46:44.620 --> 46:46.620
Because basically you just have a

46:46.620 --> 46:48.620
Vat of scalding hot liquid

46:48.620 --> 46:50.620
Sitting around for people

46:50.620 --> 46:52.620
Who are maybe at best phoning it

46:52.620 --> 46:54.620
In yeah I mean they're probably keeping that bad boy

46:54.620 --> 46:56.620
Like what 129, 130

46:56.620 --> 46:58.620
Still I wouldn't want that on my

46:58.620 --> 47:00.620
It wouldn't feel good but it's not scalding

47:00.620 --> 47:02.620
So that was

47:02.620 --> 47:04.620
The story that I noticed like

47:04.620 --> 47:06.620
Because I was thinking a lot about

47:06.620 --> 47:08.620
Like meat

47:08.620 --> 47:10.620
Yeah

47:10.620 --> 47:12.620
So I noticed that one that steak and cheese

47:12.620 --> 47:14.620
Sandwich that they

47:14.620 --> 47:16.620
Are doing the prime rib steak sub

47:16.620 --> 47:18.620
And then I noticed this is always

47:18.620 --> 47:20.620
In the same week Roy Roger

47:20.620 --> 47:22.620
Says they're bringing back the steak and cheese

47:22.620 --> 47:24.620
Sandwich Oh wow

47:24.620 --> 47:26.620
Steak and cheese

47:26.620 --> 47:28.620
Features thin slices of beef steak with American

47:28.620 --> 47:30.620
Cheese and grilled onions on a delicious six inch

47:30.620 --> 47:32.620
Roll Yeah Roy Rogers

47:32.620 --> 47:34.620
Restaurants the western themed quick service restaurant chain

47:34.620 --> 47:36.620
Based in Frederick, Maryland is announcing the return of

47:36.620 --> 47:38.620

Steak and cheese sandwich for Roy Rogers

47:52.620 --> 47:54.620

47:54.620 --> 47:56.620
A fan favorite we're happy to bring it back

47:56.620 --> 47:58.620
For our royalists you know

47:58.620 --> 48:00.620
Customer that's the senior director

48:00.620 --> 48:02.620
That feels like that's something else that feels like

48:02.620 --> 48:04.620
That word means something else

48:04.620 --> 48:06.620
That's what it means it's people that love Roy Rogers

48:06.620 --> 48:08.620
We know customers will love the addition

48:08.620 --> 48:10.620
Of our new mozzarella sticks and marinara dipping sauce

48:10.620 --> 48:12.620
As well they pair great as a side or

48:12.620 --> 48:14.620
As a snack on the go

48:14.620 --> 48:16.620
I got a lot of errands to run

48:16.620 --> 48:18.620
Today give me some

48:18.620 --> 48:20.620
If you're a fast casual restaurant

48:20.620 --> 48:22.620
And you announce something that has existed

48:22.620 --> 48:24.620
For 500 years I think

48:24.620 --> 48:26.620
It should just be I think the

48:26.620 --> 48:28.620
Press statement should just be like

48:28.620 --> 48:30.620
One to two sentences hey

48:30.620 --> 48:32.620
Guys it's us Roy Rogers we

48:32.620 --> 48:34.620
Do mozzarella sticks now

48:34.620 --> 48:36.620
You probably thought we already did come have

48:36.620 --> 48:38.620
Them yeah we get that it seems like something

48:38.620 --> 48:40.620
We would have done before now I like the

48:40.620 --> 48:42.620
They just casually threw in there

48:42.620 --> 48:44.620
A scenario they would imagine like

48:44.620 --> 48:46.620
I have one last present tucked behind

48:46.620 --> 48:48.620
The tree let's see what it is

48:48.620 --> 48:50.620
Roy Rogers gift card thanks

48:58.620 --> 49:00.620
Of year for food that provides comfort

49:00.620 --> 49:02.620
And reminds us of home

Limited time offerings do just that and are

49:06.620 --> 49:08.620
Delicious additions to the menu

49:08.620 --> 49:10.620

49:14.620 --> 49:16.620
The perfect gift or stocking stuff

49:16.620 --> 49:18.620
For this holiday season

49:18.620 --> 49:20.620
Okay so we really are and then

49:20.620 --> 49:22.620
Then I just

49:22.620 --> 49:24.620
Drive on over by Quizno's

49:24.620 --> 49:26.620
Press release outlet no way

49:26.620 --> 49:28.620
Quizno's prime rib sub makes

49:28.620 --> 49:30.620
Their long awaited return

49:30.620 --> 49:32.620
Announced the same week as these

49:32.620 --> 49:34.620
Other stories

49:34.620 --> 49:36.620
Is it okay is this all connected

49:36.620 --> 49:38.620
To the McRib retirement this is what I don't

49:38.620 --> 49:40.620
I can't figure out

49:40.620 --> 49:42.620
They are searching this is guys

49:42.620 --> 49:44.620
This is house of the dragon haven't seen it

49:44.620 --> 49:46.620
But I think this is what it is where they're searching

49:46.620 --> 49:48.620
They're vying

49:48.620 --> 49:50.620
Politicking to discover the heir apparent

49:50.620 --> 49:52.620
To the McRib kingdom

49:52.620 --> 49:54.620
And this is thrilling

49:54.620 --> 49:56.620
For me this is super exciting

49:56.620 --> 49:58.620
Three years after its last appearance

49:58.620 --> 50:00.620
The popular prime rib subs are back

50:00.620 --> 50:02.620
For guests to indulge

50:02.620 --> 50:04.620
In the comforting and satisfying flavors

50:04.620 --> 50:06.620
Of slow roasted prime rib

50:06.620 --> 50:08.620
As the holiday season draws near

50:08.620 --> 50:10.620
Are you shitting me

50:10.620 --> 50:12.620
Are both of you all trying to be like the perfect

50:12.620 --> 50:14.620
Holiday food

50:14.620 --> 50:16.620
A messy cheese steak sandwich

50:16.620 --> 50:18.620
Okay so this I looked it up right because

50:18.620 --> 50:20.620
It stuck in my mind

50:20.620 --> 50:22.620
Prime rib is like a

50:22.620 --> 50:24.620
Thing that for like

50:24.620 --> 50:26.620
Many is like a traditional

50:26.620 --> 50:28.620
Christmas dinner thing right

50:28.620 --> 50:30.620
But this isn't that

50:30.620 --> 50:32.620
This is a steak hoagie

50:32.620 --> 50:34.620
It's not that

50:34.620 --> 50:36.620
It may be bursting with

50:36.620 --> 50:38.620
With flavor and dry rub with

50:38.620 --> 50:40.620
Black pepper garlic and salt

50:40.620 --> 50:42.620
Don't brag about putting salt

50:42.620 --> 50:44.620
On it

50:44.620 --> 50:46.620
Three of the most basic

50:46.620 --> 50:48.620
Things you can put on something

50:48.620 --> 50:50.620
Salt pepper and garlic

50:50.620 --> 50:52.620
Listing salt is an admission that you didn't put

50:52.620 --> 50:54.620
Any other flavors on it

50:54.620 --> 50:56.620
You would have said anything other than salt

50:56.620 --> 50:58.620
And get this we cooked it

50:58.620 --> 51:00.620
Like how cool man

51:00.620 --> 51:02.620
It's got a creamy horseradish sauce

51:02.620 --> 51:04.620
The prime Italian is made with slow roasted prime rib

51:04.620 --> 51:06.620
Provolone cheese

51:06.620 --> 51:08.620
Sauteed onions

51:08.620 --> 51:10.620
The

51:10.620 --> 51:12.620
Giardiniera

51:12.620 --> 51:14.620
It's the pepper

51:14.620 --> 51:16.620
It's like the

51:16.620 --> 51:18.620
Green peppers

51:18.620 --> 51:20.620
For many

51:20.620 --> 51:22.620
This is a quote that is in a different

51:22.620 --> 51:24.620
Press release than the last one

51:24.620 --> 51:26.620
For many

51:26.620 --> 51:28.620
The holiday season is an ideal time

51:28.620 --> 51:30.620
To cozy up with indulgent foods

51:30.620 --> 51:32.620
And get together with family

51:32.620 --> 51:34.620
Surrounding themselves with comfort and familiarity

51:34.620 --> 51:36.620
Says Mike Geisman

51:36.620 --> 51:38.620
Vice president of culinary innovation

51:38.620 --> 51:40.620
We invite our guests to experience

51:40.620 --> 51:42.620
Those same feelings

51:42.620 --> 51:44.620
At Quiznos

51:44.620 --> 51:46.620
Travis that's the next

51:46.620 --> 51:48.620
Experience those same feelings when they walk into a Quiznos

51:48.620 --> 51:50.620
If you experience the feeling of

51:50.620 --> 51:52.620
Being home when you walk into a Quiznos

51:52.620 --> 51:54.620
That's not good

51:54.620 --> 51:56.620
That's bad

51:56.620 --> 51:58.620
I feel comforted and surrounded by family

51:58.620 --> 52:00.620
At this Quiznos

52:00.620 --> 52:02.620
If you work at the Quiznos and it's like

52:02.620 --> 52:04.620
These are my people

52:04.620 --> 52:06.620
That's fine

52:06.620 --> 52:08.620
I would say even that's not great

52:08.620 --> 52:10.620
You should know it's a

52:10.620 --> 52:12.620
Found families are huge with us

52:12.620 --> 52:14.620
And maybe your family is at Quiznos

52:14.620 --> 52:16.620
That's fantastic

52:16.620 --> 52:18.620
I'm saying if you eat a sandwich and you're like

52:18.620 --> 52:20.620
I'm home

52:20.620 --> 52:22.620
That's probably less than great

52:22.620 --> 52:24.620
Especially as more and more Quiznos

52:24.620 --> 52:26.620
Across the country are closing

52:26.620 --> 52:28.620
And you're like

52:28.620 --> 52:30.620
Chasing your home from state

52:30.620 --> 52:32.620
Yeah my home

52:32.620 --> 52:34.620
My home in Huntington on 4th Avenue

52:34.620 --> 52:36.620
My home

52:36.620 --> 52:38.620
Is now a place where

52:38.620 --> 52:40.620
People go to drink wine

52:40.620 --> 52:42.620
And paint things

52:42.620 --> 52:44.620
That's in my house

52:44.620 --> 52:46.620
In your house and they didn't even ask you

52:46.620 --> 52:48.620
They are what is it paint and sip

52:48.620 --> 52:50.620
Maybe I don't know

52:50.620 --> 52:52.620
Yeah

52:52.620 --> 52:54.620
I guess

52:54.620 --> 52:56.620
It's true what they say

52:56.620 --> 52:58.620
That the supply chain is really

52:58.620 --> 53:00.620
Just dictating all this stuff

53:00.620 --> 53:02.620
It's clearly somebody backed up

53:02.620 --> 53:04.620
Too many

53:04.620 --> 53:06.620
We got a lot of rib

53:06.620 --> 53:08.620
We got a lot of beefs

53:08.620 --> 53:10.620
We got some thin slices of shit

53:10.620 --> 53:12.620
Tell them it's for Christmas

53:12.620 --> 53:14.620
Tell them it's a Christmas

53:14.620 --> 53:16.620
Delight

53:16.620 --> 53:18.620
My money's on Quiznos

53:18.620 --> 53:20.620
I think it would be fun if Roy Rogers won

53:20.620 --> 53:22.620
Like if Roy Rogers became

53:22.620 --> 53:24.620
The big one

53:24.620 --> 53:26.620
In the rib skirmishes

53:26.620 --> 53:28.620
Yeah

53:28.620 --> 53:30.620
The rib crisis

53:30.620 --> 53:32.620
Of 2022, 2023

53:32.620 --> 53:34.620
Because let's be honest

53:34.620 --> 53:36.620
We're not going to whip this thing in the next two months

53:36.620 --> 53:38.620
No, no, no

53:38.620 --> 53:40.620
Do you want another question?

53:40.620 --> 53:42.620
Yeah

53:42.620 --> 53:44.620
Hi brothers, I'm faced with a moral quandary

53:44.620 --> 53:46.620
You've come to the right place

53:46.620 --> 53:48.620
Our school is holding elections for student council

53:48.620 --> 53:50.620
The two of my friends are running

53:50.620 --> 53:52.620
I've already voted for them

53:52.620 --> 53:54.620
But this morning on the quad

53:54.620 --> 53:56.620
There was a guy who was campaigning by handing out mini gourds

53:56.620 --> 53:58.620
In a massive burlap sack

53:58.620 --> 54:00.620
To people who promised to vote for him

54:00.620 --> 54:02.620
The gourds are really cute and I want to have one

54:02.620 --> 54:04.620
Is it morally right

54:04.620 --> 54:06.620
To lie to this poor man

54:06.620 --> 54:08.620
Just for a free calabash squash?

54:08.620 --> 54:10.620
And that's from squash squanderer in New York

54:10.620 --> 54:12.620
Can I just say

54:12.620 --> 54:14.620
It feels like a long way to go

54:14.620 --> 54:16.620
To get a vote

54:16.620 --> 54:18.620
When you could just like buy a bag of like

54:18.620 --> 54:20.620
Mixed mini chocolate bars

54:20.620 --> 54:22.620
Especially now

54:22.620 --> 54:24.620
During a Halloween season

54:24.620 --> 54:26.620
I love candy

54:26.620 --> 54:28.620
Where are you getting so many gourds

54:28.620 --> 54:30.620
That you can hand them out as a favor

54:30.620 --> 54:32.620
It seems like a huge expense

54:32.620 --> 54:34.620
You know I'm in

54:34.620 --> 54:36.620
Politics country now

54:36.620 --> 54:38.620
Where it all happens

54:38.620 --> 54:40.620
Yeah

54:40.620 --> 54:42.620
And I will say that a lot

54:42.620 --> 54:44.620
Like a surprising amount of stuff

54:44.620 --> 54:46.620
Here

54:46.620 --> 54:48.620
Is like a lot of the political

54:48.620 --> 54:50.620
Processes are lubricated with like

54:50.620 --> 54:52.620
Fun sized Mr. Good bars

54:52.620 --> 54:54.620
Crackles

54:54.620 --> 54:56.620
Hershey's with almond

54:56.620 --> 54:58.620
That greases a lot of the wheels

54:58.620 --> 55:00.620
Cause they can't get enough of this stuff

55:00.620 --> 55:02.620
Well and the secret is

55:02.620 --> 55:04.620
You do a special dark and a good bar

55:04.620 --> 55:06.620
At the same time

55:06.620 --> 55:08.620
Oh fuck off that's too much

55:08.620 --> 55:10.620
This is a crime

55:10.620 --> 55:12.620
What this person is doing is a crime

55:12.620 --> 55:14.620
Oh right Justin

55:14.620 --> 55:16.620
Justin's been like Toby Zigglering around

55:16.620 --> 55:18.620
For a while now

55:18.620 --> 55:20.620
And he thinks he's Mr. Politics and Ethics

55:20.620 --> 55:22.620
If I can pay people for votes

55:22.620 --> 55:24.620
Yeah

55:24.620 --> 55:26.620
Okay listen if it was legal

55:26.620 --> 55:28.620
You can't do this it's a crime now that being said

55:28.620 --> 55:30.620
Hand out gourds

55:30.620 --> 55:32.620
You don't want to be mixed up

55:32.620 --> 55:34.620
In this endeavor you can't pay people

55:34.620 --> 55:36.620
For votes that said

55:36.620 --> 55:38.620
If they got Adela Khan over there

55:38.620 --> 55:40.620
Let me come by

55:40.620 --> 55:42.620
I can't get I don't have a trader

55:42.620 --> 55:44.620
Ricks a trader no

55:44.620 --> 55:46.620
That's the werewolves in London

55:46.620 --> 55:48.620
Trader Sam's nope

55:48.620 --> 55:50.620
You'll get there

55:50.620 --> 55:52.620
Trader Joe's I don't have a Trader Joe's around here

55:52.620 --> 55:54.620
I don't have a Jungle Jim's you know what I mean

55:54.620 --> 55:56.620
I gotta get my Delicata when people go out of town

55:56.620 --> 55:58.620
They're like can I get you a souvenir

55:58.620 --> 56:00.620
Bring you back some Delicata squash

56:00.620 --> 56:02.620
Dude you can eat the rind thank you

56:02.620 --> 56:04.620
But Justin I'm sorry

56:04.620 --> 56:06.620
Oh yeah constantly

56:06.620 --> 56:08.620
Constantly man at this point

56:08.620 --> 56:10.620
I'm more Delicata squash than I am man

56:10.620 --> 56:12.620
But here's the question Justin in your mind

56:12.620 --> 56:14.620
Paying someone a tiny decadent

56:14.620 --> 56:16.620
Seasonal Gourd is paying them for votes

56:16.620 --> 56:18.620
In what

56:18.620 --> 56:20.620
In what world can you use

56:20.620 --> 56:22.620
A tiny decorative Gourd as currency

56:22.620 --> 56:24.620
And please point me in the direction

56:24.620 --> 56:26.620
Of that world cause I'm a very rich man

56:26.620 --> 56:28.620
Pumpkin town

56:28.620 --> 56:30.620
Good point yeah I didn't think about that

56:30.620 --> 56:32.620
You can't you don't want to get

56:32.620 --> 56:34.620
Mixed up in this business this is dark stuff

56:34.620 --> 56:36.620
I'll say but it sounds like

56:36.620 --> 56:38.620
To me you have two friends

56:38.620 --> 56:40.620
Running for

56:40.620 --> 56:42.620
Student council competing

56:42.620 --> 56:44.620
It sounds like against each other

56:44.620 --> 56:46.620
They said they already voted for them

56:46.620 --> 56:48.620
Well fraud clearly

56:48.620 --> 56:50.620
They might be different positions

56:50.620 --> 56:52.620
Oh that's another good point

56:52.620 --> 56:54.620
Yeah maybe it's not fraud

56:54.620 --> 56:56.620
But regardless you can feign ignorance

56:56.620 --> 56:58.620
And be like sorry I thought you guys were competing

56:58.620 --> 57:00.620
Against each other and I could not choose

57:00.620 --> 57:02.620
And I got this cutie little Gourd

57:02.620 --> 57:04.620
This sweet little squash outside

57:04.620 --> 57:06.620
And I told the guy I'd vote for him

57:06.620 --> 57:08.620
Cause I couldn't pick between you two it's not fair

57:08.620 --> 57:10.620
So I voted third party

57:10.620 --> 57:12.620
For this one

57:12.620 --> 57:14.620
Cause here's the beautiful thing I don't know if you guys know this

57:14.620 --> 57:16.620
You can tell anybody you're voting for anything

57:16.620 --> 57:18.620
They can't check

57:18.620 --> 57:20.620
You can be like I'll definitely

57:20.620 --> 57:22.620
Vote for you and unless that guy loses

57:22.620 --> 57:24.620
By like one vote and then breaks

57:24.620 --> 57:26.620
Into like the student council offices

57:26.620 --> 57:28.620
Or whatever it goes through each

57:28.620 --> 57:30.620
Thing and it's like wait a minute it was Todd

57:30.620 --> 57:32.620
Todd took one of my gourds and they didn't vote for me

57:32.620 --> 57:34.620
I'm going to ruin Todd's life

57:34.620 --> 57:36.620
Maybe maybe that might happen

57:36.620 --> 57:38.620
In my new YA novel that I'm working

57:38.620 --> 57:40.620
On please don't copy this concept

57:40.620 --> 57:42.620
I've said it out loud everybody forget what I said

57:42.620 --> 57:44.620
Forget what I said this is mine

57:44.620 --> 57:46.620
I mean it is Kevin Costner's swing vote

57:46.620 --> 57:48.620
And that's fun that you reinvented

57:48.620 --> 57:50.620
That film this time for a reboot

57:50.620 --> 57:52.620
I'm calling mine Gourd to death

57:52.620 --> 57:54.620
Yeah thank you

57:54.620 --> 57:56.620
Get out of sploom house that was good stuff

57:56.620 --> 57:58.620
Speaking of like the

57:58.620 --> 58:00.620
Politics thing

58:00.620 --> 58:02.620
Did you all see

58:02.620 --> 58:04.620
That god

58:04.620 --> 58:06.620
I'm so delighted did you guys see the attack ad

58:06.620 --> 58:08.620
Hell yeah I did dude Griffin did you see it

58:08.620 --> 58:10.620
Oh yeah I saw the attack ad

58:10.620 --> 58:12.620
I got sent it

58:12.620 --> 58:14.620
They made a lot of good points

58:14.620 --> 58:16.620
They made a lot of good points

58:16.620 --> 58:18.620
I don't want to talk too much about it but I do want to say

58:18.620 --> 58:20.620
The front of it is just this

58:20.620 --> 58:22.620
Picture of gas prices with Joe Biden

58:22.620 --> 58:24.620
Like good gas prices

58:24.620 --> 58:26.620
And Sidney's like I love it

58:26.620 --> 58:28.620
I had no idea

58:28.620 --> 58:30.620
I've known Sidney now for decades

58:30.620 --> 58:32.620
I had no idea she had such influence over

58:32.620 --> 58:34.620
The national gas

58:34.620 --> 58:36.620
Prices no idea

58:36.620 --> 58:38.620
Here's what I wanted to

58:38.620 --> 58:40.620
Say though is that this mailer does

58:40.620 --> 58:42.620
Include the phrase

58:42.620 --> 58:44.620
That is on a political mailer

58:44.620 --> 58:46.620
In the world the Biden

58:46.620 --> 58:48.620
Slash McElroy agenda

58:48.620 --> 58:50.620
The Biden McElroy agenda

58:50.620 --> 58:52.620
That's really really

58:52.620 --> 58:54.620
Really strong

58:54.620 --> 58:56.620
That's not something we made up for this show

58:56.620 --> 58:58.620
That was like the Biden McElroy agenda

58:58.620 --> 59:00.620
Very very good

59:00.620 --> 59:02.620
The only way that that makes sense

59:02.620 --> 59:04.620
Is if it's like the Biden slash McElroy agenda

59:04.620 --> 59:06.620
And then underneath it in bullet points is

59:06.620 --> 59:08.620
Leaving a ticket at will call

59:08.620 --> 59:10.620
At every live show they've ever done

59:10.620 --> 59:12.620
In Washington DC for Joe Biden

59:12.620 --> 59:14.620
Hoping he'll show up

59:14.620 --> 59:16.620
That's the only McElroy slash Biden agenda

59:16.620 --> 59:18.620
I know of that exists

59:18.620 --> 59:20.620
On this planet

59:20.620 --> 59:22.620
Do you know how bad you have to

59:22.620 --> 59:24.620
Be at your job

59:24.620 --> 59:26.620
Because of who Sidney is

59:26.620 --> 59:28.620
Married to to not be

59:28.620 --> 59:30.620
Able to cook up a very very

59:30.620 --> 59:32.620
Very very very

59:32.620 --> 59:34.620
Very bad mailer

59:34.620 --> 59:36.620
The possibilities

59:36.620 --> 59:38.620
Are endless

59:38.620 --> 59:40.620
We love Sidney you love Sidney

59:40.620 --> 59:42.620
Everybody loves Sidney

59:42.620 --> 59:44.620
This clown

59:44.620 --> 59:46.620
This absolute degenerate

59:46.620 --> 59:48.620
You see this guy in the pumpkin suit

59:48.620 --> 59:50.620
Who said he just came from a wedding

59:50.620 --> 59:52.620
He's like right there with her

59:52.620 --> 59:54.620
You see this man in a chili suit

59:54.620 --> 59:56.620
In a pumpkin suit who's got chili

59:56.620 --> 59:58.620
All over his hands and face

59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.620
That's in the last week

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.620
We're not even getting like

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.620
Scrolling out of his Google calendar page

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.620
To find these embarrassing things

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:08.620
That's a choice Sidney made once

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.620
A while ago it's been stuck with

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.620
Every other choice has been great

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.620
But she did this one time

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.620
Choose this guy are you sure

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:18.620
Are you sure

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.620
There's gotta be something fundamentally funny

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.620
Oh gosh politics is fun

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.620
Thank you so much for listening to our

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:28.620

Really miss talking to you guys

Both you two and the listeners

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.620
I really miss doing this

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.620

Place where you can vote for Sidney

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.620
Do that that would be

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.620
A great birthday present for me

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.620

Not in that order Travis I'm begging you

DAR DMV baby let's go

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:04.620
With Brennan Lee Mulligan

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.620
DMing Dad Lance 2

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:08.620
Y'all I could not

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:10.620
Be more excited for that fucking live show

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.620
Come out to it

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:14.620
If you live within driving distance

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.620
Of this show I guarantee you

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.620
It's going to be a gosh dang barn burner

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.620
The last one was a hoot

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:22.620
I did a thing with Roll20Con

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.620
Playing with Brennan

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.620
And a bunch of other folks including Abria

01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.620
And it was great but when I was there

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.620
I was talking to Brennan about the show and I was like

01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.620
Yeah I'm thinking maybe new characters

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:34.620
And the look on his face was like you guys aren't going to be the same characters

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.620
But I love those characters

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:38.620
I'm going to be the same characters

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:40.620
I had forgotten that he remembered

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.620
Until he said you're not going to be Guy Ferrari again

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:44.620
I was like fuck that's good yeah I'll be Guy Ferrari

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.620
It's going to be great

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.620
Speaking of Abria we've rescheduled our shows

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:50.620

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:52.620

01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:58.620
Who just a taste of that

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.620
When we did Spirit Breakers for Halloween

01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:02.620
Abria is an absolute joy and brings out

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:04.620
The best in us I would say

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:06.620

Covid test within 72 hours of events

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:28.620

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.620
New month so there will be new merch go check

Pre-order the Taz 11th hour

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.620
It comes out officially

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:40.620
February 21st 2023 but you can

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:42.620
Pre-order it now at The Adventure Zone

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.620
Comic.com And I just

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.620
Wanted to say one more thing about that Detroit Live

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:48.620
Show that is going to be on

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.620
November 11th which as

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.620
You all know is the 14th anniversary

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.620
Of the release of Star Wars the Clone Wars

01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:56.620
Lightsaber now on the Wii

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.620
Yeah I feel like

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.620
A themed Star Wars

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:02.620
Episode only makes sense to celebrate

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.620
That release and we can

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.620
Say that because they pay us no matter if

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:08.620
People come or not like we obviously prefer

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.620
If people come but if nobody

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:12.620
Shows up then we can kind of like

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:14.620
Griffin's right but only

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.620
In this very limited scope where like

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.620
That trick works once

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:20.620
And then they don't do any more

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:22.620
After that so please do come. We will not be doing

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:24.620
I guarantee you we won't be doing a Star Wars show

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:26.620
I won't mention Star Wars up there

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.620
But it'll be in Justin's mind you would feel

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:30.620
It you'll feel it he'll be in full cosplay

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.620
Hey yeah thanks what if

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.620
Holy shit what if we were in full cosplay

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:36.620
But did not mention it. Okay

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:38.620
That's fine. Anyway thanks to Montaigne

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.620
Also for the use of our theme song My Life Is Better

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:42.620
With you. Stream that album

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:44.620

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.620

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.620

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.620
But especially Montaigne's art cause it's

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.620
Very good. That's it

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:54.620
That's it for the show

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:56.620
Thank you so much for listening

01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:58.620
Griffin can you inspire us

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:00.620
For like any quotes that you want to

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:02.620
Like

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.620
You're looking very thoughtful. Don't give up

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:06.620
Unless

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.620
Don't give up unless

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:10.620
No

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.620
Keep on pushing

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.620
What's the thing that the guy

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.620
That one of the presidents said where he's like if you're going through

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:22.620
Hell don't stop

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.620
If you're going through hell don't stop

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.620
Can't be it

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.620
I think it was

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:30.620
I think it was Benjamin Franklin

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.620
Who said if you're going through hell don't stop

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:34.620
My name is Justin McElroy

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.620
I'm Travis McElroy

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:38.620

01:05:38.620 --> 01:06:06.620
I'm Travis McElroy

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.620

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:38.620
