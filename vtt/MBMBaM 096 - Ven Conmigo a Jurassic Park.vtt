WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:40.880
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

00:44.880 --> 00:53.520
We're coming to you today. We're coming to you today. So loud. So loud. Shhh.

00:53.520 --> 01:02.400
Quieter still? Yeah. Ow, ow, ow. Travis, drink this oyster water. Thank you. Hello, everybody.

01:02.400 --> 01:10.400
Welcome. Welcome. Shhh. Welcome to my brother, my brother and me. It's an advice show about quiet

01:10.400 --> 01:18.000
people for quiet people who don't make a ruckus and don't turn on the light. For the love of God,

01:18.000 --> 01:24.640
just leave it off. I know it's dark in here. Sit down on this futon and relax. Oh, my nose is

01:24.640 --> 01:32.080
bleeding. Oh, God. Oh, that's bad. That's bad. It's green. That's not normal. That's the worst.

01:32.080 --> 01:38.560
That's the worst, yet authentic. That's a lot of food coloring in your diet you had to put in there.

01:39.440 --> 01:44.880
I am wearing five sleep masks. So loud. Sorry, sorry, sorry. So loud. Sorry. Please,

01:44.880 --> 01:53.280
just can we all just be quiet? It's the day after St. Patrick's Day and Travis and Griffin

01:53.920 --> 02:00.480
are really hungover. And I'm sort of hungover because I was cleaning up pet stains all night

02:00.480 --> 02:08.480
with my new spot bot by Bissell. So I guess we all had pretty crazy nights. This is an

02:08.480 --> 02:13.760
advice show for the modern era. I guess our first piece of advice is don't- Don't drink.

02:13.760 --> 02:20.160
Don't ever drink. Don't drink. Don't drink ever again. I had six sore teeth last night.

02:20.160 --> 02:25.040
No, Griffin, no. Six of them. Bartrand was just like, you want any more? And I said,

02:25.040 --> 02:31.120
yes, one more. And I did that five times after the first one. I had eight baby makers. Oh,

02:31.120 --> 02:36.160
wowsers. Oh, wowsers. That's the one that actually has turpentine in it, doesn't it?

02:36.160 --> 02:44.160
Yep. It's like a Boilermaker, but you drop in a shot of turpentine. Yikes. Yeah, I was only

02:44.160 --> 02:53.520
supposed to use one third parts pet stain remover to water. And I said, what if I did half and half?

02:53.520 --> 02:57.360
You said these are some hearty stains. And you burned right through your carpet.

02:57.360 --> 03:06.000
Well, no, I mean, I drank it. Right. Yeah. But no, no, I did. I did really eradicated,

03:06.000 --> 03:11.120
really eradicated the pet odor. CJ's got some hearty piss. I've always said that.

03:11.760 --> 03:18.320
Gotta go industrial on that shit. Well, and she did drink yesterday. Oh, I see. Yeah. So she-

03:20.160 --> 03:26.160
Oh, this is not a goof. I feel like dog shit. Well, I'm goof- Travis, how do you feel?

03:26.160 --> 03:29.520
I actually feel great. I went for a walk this morning. I went out in the sun.

03:30.160 --> 03:34.800
I felt great. I sprung out of bed with a spring in my step, sat down, played some Mass Effect 3,

03:34.800 --> 03:39.200
and then I felt great. And I burped, and that burped turned into a throw up. And I was like,

03:39.200 --> 03:42.880
what? You burped. But I felt great, body.

03:44.480 --> 03:51.040
It's the older- Cindy gets this. It's passed down on her mother's side of the family. They call it

03:51.040 --> 03:59.680
the Meadows Reversal. You wake up feeling good, and then oopsies. It's done in reverse. Anyway,

03:59.680 --> 04:03.840
this is an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your

04:03.840 --> 04:09.280
middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Griffin, these footprints

04:09.280 --> 04:16.160
in the sand will be where Travis and I carried you. Yeah. I don't know how sick you are. We're

04:16.160 --> 04:20.320
going to help with the chuckles. If you vomit on my jacket, I will leave you on the beach. Vomit

04:20.320 --> 04:25.280
on my sandals. This place on the beach where you are sleeping is where we left you because you

04:25.280 --> 04:30.880
vomited on Travis. Because you threw up on my Sweet Members Only jacket, and I left you behind.

04:30.880 --> 04:35.040
We paid a hobo $3. And then when the tide came in, he pulled you off the beach a bit,

04:35.840 --> 04:40.480
and he stole your jacket. These drag marks are where he dragged you. These drag marks are where

04:40.480 --> 04:48.320
he dragged you. Does the dookie stay? He's homeless. I don't know. He's had a rough life.

04:48.320 --> 04:54.240
Listen, he's a vet. He gave everything. Some gave all, all gave some. He's played by Danny Trejo.

04:58.400 --> 05:05.040
He is played by Danny Trejo. Danny Trejo's finest acting role was as the homeless man who drug me

05:07.440 --> 05:10.720
in a story that Justin and Griffin made up about me.

05:10.720 --> 05:14.080
Can we start the show so that we can be done with the show soon?

05:14.080 --> 05:19.200
So you can go die? Yeah. Your last will and testament will be this program?

05:19.200 --> 05:23.600
Yes. I have two really good friends, and they both have girlfriends, and I feel left out.

05:24.640 --> 05:32.080
People, have we helped you too much? While the universe itself continues to put questions into

05:32.080 --> 05:39.760
the Yahoo Answers system that are both terrifying and wonderful, I feel like our listeners don't

05:39.760 --> 05:45.040
need us as much as they used to. We get questions that are easy, easy stuff.

05:47.360 --> 05:52.000
But I like this. It's a nice slow ball to kind of get us past St. Patrick's Day.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.200
Okay, yeah. We'll start. We'll warm up. I have two really good friends, and they both have

05:57.200 --> 06:01.040
girlfriends, and I feel left out. What should I do? Get yourself a girlfriend.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.680
Get a girlfriend. See, that was an easy one.

06:03.680 --> 06:11.360
Wait, hold on. You guys. See, this is... 96 episodes ago, this is the caliber of advice

06:11.360 --> 06:16.880
that we were handing out, but we've come so far. Holy shit, our 100th episode is getting up very

06:16.880 --> 06:22.960
soon. And then we cash it in. We've come so far, we've got to come at it like a raptor,

06:22.960 --> 06:27.920
like two raptors. Pince it. Give it the pincer. What if I told this guy, or girl,

06:27.920 --> 06:33.200
guy, well, I don't know, either way, you got to get new friends.

06:34.960 --> 06:38.000
Okay. How about that? Or a whole new life.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.000
Like witness protection kind of thing. Okay.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.200
Wait a minute, that seems drastic. In this modern world, you got to take drastic steps for results.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.880
I don't know. I feel like the witness protection program...

06:52.880 --> 06:55.440
Oh, the third wheel protection program.

06:55.440 --> 06:59.600
Yeah. There's a mystique to the witness protection program,

06:59.600 --> 07:03.920
because we've all thought about in some point during our lives, usually during middle school,

07:03.920 --> 07:06.960
like, everything's awful. What if I could just start over?

07:08.000 --> 07:12.400
Witness protection program will give you that kind of service.

07:15.200 --> 07:20.560
I think that maybe as we move into the next era, My Brother, My Brother and Me 2.0,

07:20.560 --> 07:24.240
that kicks off with episode 100. When we go public.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.400
When we go public. We do our IPO.

07:26.400 --> 07:32.320
IPO, yeah. Maybe the new pack your bags and move away is pack your bags and inform on the mob,

07:33.200 --> 07:38.400
because then that's a clean start. It doesn't matter. How many of your good friends have

07:38.400 --> 07:45.920
girlfriends? Hey, have you considered trying to split them up like in a Jennifer Aniston movie?

07:45.920 --> 07:48.400
This is great. Give it to Janiston.

07:48.400 --> 07:55.600
Give it to Janiston. Go find one girl. Sleep with the guy. Wait, hold on.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.840
What messes up? This isn't good advice.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.440
Sleep with both guys.

07:59.440 --> 08:03.360
Turn into a Rupert Everett movie. Pit the couples against each other.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.440
Oh, my God. End up double there.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.200
Oh, my God. Hunger Games.

08:07.200 --> 08:11.920
Hunger Games for your love. Here's what you should do. Here's what is easy.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.640
This is a way better answer to your problem. Hunger Games.

08:16.640 --> 08:23.680
Have you considered Hunger Games? Hunger Games is the new pack your bags and inform on the mafia,

08:23.680 --> 08:26.080
because if you have Hunger Games- Pack your bags, eat your friends.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.320
Pack your bags and eat your friends. I don't think that's what happens in

08:28.320 --> 08:29.920
the Hunger Games. I've never read it,

08:29.920 --> 08:34.240
but I assume it's a lot about cannibalism. Fuck, I'm hungry. Let's play Monopoly.

08:35.840 --> 08:40.240
Winner take all. Winner take all your bones. Winner take all the bites.

08:40.240 --> 08:48.560
So if you eat their girlfriends- Then you've won. You've won the Hunger Games.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.560
Here's a medal. That is the way the Hunger

08:50.560 --> 08:53.360
Games are played. What a weird fucking board game.

08:53.360 --> 08:57.200
What is this movie rated? It seems unseemly.

08:57.200 --> 09:04.480
I watched Woody Harrelson eat Staley Tucci and he unhinged his jaw and swallowed him whole.

09:05.680 --> 09:09.600
Is Tucci and Harrelson really in it? Oh, yeah, the Tucci's lose.

09:09.600 --> 09:14.560
The Tucci's lose. The Tucci's fully loose in Hunger Games.

09:14.560 --> 09:19.040
Woody Harrelson plays- Well, I'm not going to let in on how much

09:19.040 --> 09:23.840
Hunger Games insight I have, but- Have you read the books, haven't you?

09:24.480 --> 09:26.560
All of them, baby. And here's the thing,

09:27.120 --> 09:29.120
Travis is on the money. Yeah?

09:29.120 --> 09:31.520
It's all about cannibalism. I knew it.

09:31.520 --> 09:37.520
Yeah, Woody Harrelson plays the drunken tutor of the lead lady,

09:37.520 --> 09:41.520
and Stanley Tucci is sort of the talk show host that makes her a star.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.680
All right. And then they eat each other?

09:44.560 --> 09:50.080
Well, yeah, Woody Harrelson unhinges his jaw. Now, Griffin, I don't want you to be scared.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.720
It's all special effects. Because the twist is,

09:52.720 --> 09:56.720
as Woody Harrelson is eating Stanley Tucci, Stanley Tucci is eating Woody Harrelson.

09:56.720 --> 10:02.160
Right from the inside out. And here's the weird thing.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.400
You remember Coach, the original bartender on Cheers?

10:04.400 --> 10:07.040
He finds a baby one inside Woody Harrelson's belly.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.720
Wow. Yeah, apparently,

10:08.720 --> 10:12.560
Woody Harrelson ate Coach on Cheers, and that's how he got to be famous.

10:12.560 --> 10:15.360
I see. So, Tucci goes on a fantastic adventure

10:15.360 --> 10:18.240
inside of Woody Harrelson? Right.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.560
Have you seen Innerspace? I've seen Innerspace.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.400
It's like that, but what if they didn't shrink?

10:24.560 --> 10:28.560
You could just see Stanley Tucci's weird bald head poking out from the

10:28.560 --> 10:33.200
distended belly of Woody Harrelson. That's like three fourths of the Hunger Games,

10:33.200 --> 10:34.960
right there. That scene.

10:34.960 --> 10:38.320
We need a retroactive spoiler warning, retroactively.

10:39.680 --> 10:43.440
Retroactive spoiler warning. We spoiled your life by talking about this,

10:44.080 --> 10:48.320
and we're sorry. So, I guess that should solve your problems.

10:49.360 --> 10:53.840
Guys, I have a handful of choice, just dank Yahoos.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.840
This one was sent in by Tim. Thank you, Tim. It's by Yahoo Answers user,

10:59.840 --> 11:07.120
Anatolia Monster, who asks, Monsters, what do to for Lady Gaga's birthday?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.680
What? Mother Monster's birthday is approaching.

11:11.680 --> 11:16.960
Have you decided what to do to celebrate? I'm planning on making a video for her,

11:16.960 --> 11:19.600
even if she won't see it. Have you got any better ideas?

11:20.560 --> 11:25.920
We've got 10 days to Lady Gaga's birthday, and I haven't made her a goddamn thing.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.760
Why do you know that? What?

11:27.760 --> 11:31.360
What? Why do you know that?

11:31.360 --> 11:35.520
How could you know that? It, because I remember it,

11:35.520 --> 11:38.960
it's pretty easy to, it's not like I'm a super fan or anything, it's pretty easy to remember.

11:39.840 --> 11:49.680
I have tickets to the Monsters Ball on June 19th, and that's exactly 87 days after her birthday.

11:49.680 --> 11:53.840
So that, it's pretty easy to remember when you're using that, when you're using that metric, you know?

11:53.840 --> 12:00.640
Do you read the Hunger Games at the Lady Gaga party out loud?

12:00.640 --> 12:02.320
She projects them on a screen.

12:03.120 --> 12:07.840
There ain't no reason for me to eat Stanley Touche tonight, baby.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.560
Come on, Woody Harrelson.

12:11.920 --> 12:16.000
If that were true, I would, I would get the whole Lady Gaga thing, finally.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.400
Finally. She sits there and reads Hunger Games to you.

12:20.400 --> 12:25.520
I get it. Additional details. I was asking little monsters only.

12:27.040 --> 12:31.840
As opposed to like, medium average monster? Like, what?

12:32.720 --> 12:35.840
Well, like the Lady Gaga fans come in three distinct size sets.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.720
You got little monsters.

12:38.720 --> 12:39.920
Starting with Savage.

12:39.920 --> 12:43.520
Which is, it's actually exclusively for Savage. Fuck, I feel bad.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.440
I'm gonna drink some water.

12:46.000 --> 12:46.400
Okay.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.840
You got medium monsters.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.520
Now, what is a media monster? Like, what does that entail?

12:52.480 --> 12:58.480
You ever just look at a person and you learn their name, and then you look at someone else to,

12:58.480 --> 13:02.320
like, have a conversation, and you immediately forget the face and name of the person you were

13:02.320 --> 13:03.520
just talking to?

13:03.520 --> 13:04.080
Uh-huh.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.520
That's a medium monster.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.160
Got it.

13:06.160 --> 13:06.660
Okay.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.920
And then there's huge monsters, which is fat people.

13:09.920 --> 13:10.400
Okay.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.680
Which actually makes up 89% of the population.

13:13.680 --> 13:19.200
Okay. Which actually makes up 89% of the Lady Gaga fan base, which is interesting enough.

13:20.880 --> 13:24.480
So, yeah, you slot in one of those three, and then you know,

13:25.440 --> 13:28.400
you know, like, which monster union you belong to.

13:28.400 --> 13:33.120
Mm-hmm. Now, the title monster, is that like a self-imposed thing by the fans?

13:33.760 --> 13:36.240
Are they like, we are monsters? Because I agree.

13:36.240 --> 13:43.360
Um, no, she's actually, uh, she is actually Chupacabra.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.200
Right. She is Chupacabra made woman.

13:47.200 --> 13:47.520
Yes.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.040
She's been given a, basically-

13:49.040 --> 13:49.920
Well, that, that is-

13:49.920 --> 13:50.960
Tape on the woman's body.

13:50.960 --> 13:58.160
That's one of the powers that Chupacabra brings to the table, is lady transformation.

13:58.160 --> 13:58.720
That's why they get-

13:58.720 --> 13:59.680
Look at the lip.

13:59.680 --> 14:00.960
That's right. That's how it gets you.

14:00.960 --> 14:07.200
And also, can eat just piles of lettuce. Just disappears.

14:07.760 --> 14:10.560
You try to leave it around her, and it's like, whoop, gone.

14:10.560 --> 14:14.560
Travis, I want to get into something. What is your, what would you say is your,

14:15.360 --> 14:18.880
what's your beef with Gaga? What is, what's your problem?

14:18.880 --> 14:26.240
Well, my issue is this. I have no problem with, like, the persona of Lady Gaga.

14:26.240 --> 14:31.840
I have a problem with that she is Lady Gaga all the time. Like-

14:31.840 --> 14:35.360
You know that. You're not at her house. You're not watching The Bachelor with her.

14:35.360 --> 14:36.000
Yeah.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.640
I can't believe that she's not. I can't believe she goes home and, like,

14:38.640 --> 14:42.240
takes off a funky wig, and she's like, whoo! What a day!

14:42.800 --> 14:43.280
Takes off her-

14:43.280 --> 14:43.760
She-

14:43.760 --> 14:44.880
Takes off her bacon dress.

14:45.440 --> 14:49.920
That's the face. You only get that face of her. That's-

14:49.920 --> 14:53.520
Momma Monster is a character that she is playing, right? And when she's at home-

14:53.520 --> 14:57.920
See, I don't think that's true. I think that she has serious, like, psychological issues.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.040
Like, I worry for her.

14:59.040 --> 15:03.360
You're leveling some heady, dank flames on Momma Monster.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.480
Serious stuff.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.560
I worry for her. I'm concerned.

15:06.560 --> 15:10.240
Momma, Lady Gaga is her public face, and you only get to see her public face.

15:10.240 --> 15:10.720
Because Travis, you're a lot of things-

15:10.720 --> 15:11.520
When she's Mrs. Gaga.

15:11.520 --> 15:15.600
You're not her, you're not her close friend. When she goes home, she's just deaf.

15:15.600 --> 15:24.320
Eatin' cookie dough, watchin' The Bachelor. She's just deaf. Normal, normal stuff.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.680
And her studio apartment.

15:27.120 --> 15:31.040
When I'm gonna get her for her birthday, is I'm going to

15:32.480 --> 15:37.040
convert Travis into a real monster.

15:37.040 --> 15:44.320
Which is the highest level of Lady Gaga fandom, is the ah, real monster.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.440
That's it. I have no problem with the music.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.560
It's that I just don't like-

15:50.560 --> 15:53.360
Got a heart, don't you? You have two ears? Of course.

15:57.920 --> 16:03.840
Yahoo! Insta's user, Carl Walker, responded to the query of what due to for Lady Gaga's birthday.

16:03.840 --> 16:10.240
And he said, I will probably go to the bathroom, and take a dump, and watch some TV, and then sleep.

16:10.240 --> 16:14.720
You know, actually live instead of freaking over a person that I'll never meet.

16:14.720 --> 16:22.400
That guy's like the fourth brother. He's like an honorary brother right now.

16:23.840 --> 16:30.400
Me? I'm gonna go to the factory, I'm gonna make some salt, and I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna

16:30.400 --> 16:36.560
watch The Bachelor with Steph, who is my wife in real life, and not Lady Gaga.

16:36.560 --> 16:40.960
Now, Justin, first of all, I love that fiction that you're spinning.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.080
Second of all-

16:42.080 --> 16:44.640
That's what her husband does. He works at a salt factory.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.880
Lady Gaga's husband works at a salt factory?

16:46.880 --> 16:47.520
Yes, now-

16:47.520 --> 16:48.320
Mr. Gaga.

16:49.040 --> 16:49.920
Lord Gaga.

16:49.920 --> 16:54.080
Should Lord Gaga do something for her birthday? Probably.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.720
I mean, Steph has the same birthday as Lady Gaga.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.880
Take her out to TGI Fridays or something.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.560
Is he the daddy monster?

17:01.120 --> 17:01.600
Yeah.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.560
Yeah, yeah.

17:02.560 --> 17:06.240
I mean, I like this idea of like a Bernstein Bears thing going on.

17:07.520 --> 17:11.920
Yeah, there's so many different levels of Lady Gaga fandom. That's the hardest thing,

17:11.920 --> 17:17.360
is like, fans will have these squabbles, these inter-monster squabbles, and it's like,

17:18.000 --> 17:22.560
I thought we had this all situated, but I guess we gotta get the sorting hat back out,

17:23.120 --> 17:25.120
and figure out what kind of monsters everybody is.

17:25.120 --> 17:30.320
I just love her music. I don't know what to say. Love her music.

17:31.600 --> 17:32.400
What's not to love?

17:33.120 --> 17:40.240
Just love her music. Pulse- pulse pounding, rhythms, all the beats. Miracle fancy.

17:41.120 --> 17:47.280
Hey, my girlfriend and I recently got engaged, and we're looking for out-of-the-box wedding

17:47.280 --> 17:50.400
venue ideas that are relatively cheap. Both of us want a short,

17:51.120 --> 17:54.640
non-church related ceremony and a cool reception.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.840
So you don't want your wedding to count?

17:56.640 --> 18:00.800
Yeah, you don't want Jesus to recognize your marriage? That's fine. We are thinking

18:00.800 --> 18:05.760
March of next year, and since we live in the deep south, something outdoor is easily an option.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.760
Help us, brothers!

18:07.760 --> 18:08.880
Don't do an outdoor wedding.

18:09.520 --> 18:09.680
No.

18:09.680 --> 18:13.440
In Louisiana. Don't do an outdoor wedding. What if it rains? How's that?

18:13.440 --> 18:14.000
It will rain.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
Yeah. You ever see- you ever see November rain? You ever see that video? How'd that-

18:18.000 --> 18:25.200
how'd that squeak out? How'd that go? Axl Rose died, that's how. Got shot or something,

18:25.200 --> 18:28.560
or some plates fell on him. I don't remember the video very well.

18:28.560 --> 18:29.360
It ended poorly.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.840
It did not go well. In the cold November rain.

18:33.840 --> 18:34.880
McDonald's Play Place?

18:35.600 --> 18:37.280
Now, what are the advantages there?

18:38.640 --> 18:40.880
Uh, it's a wide selection of ring bears.

18:40.880 --> 18:41.440
Ball pit.

18:41.440 --> 18:53.120
It's a honeymoon suite built right in. Just drape some tarp over it and go to town.

18:55.200 --> 19:00.400
Travis, I like the idea of dragooning toddlers into your wedding.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.560
You, you're the priest now.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.840
You, you've been conscripted. You're my best man. What's your name?

19:07.120 --> 19:07.520
Ralph?

19:07.520 --> 19:08.480
You're my best-

19:08.480 --> 19:13.360
You got an old man name. Come here. Hold this ring. I'm so nervous, Ralph.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.400
Don't put it in your mouth.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.280
Ralph, talk me through this.

19:16.880 --> 19:17.680
Freaking out, Ralph.

19:17.680 --> 19:18.720
Freaking out. I'm gonna bolt.

19:19.360 --> 19:23.760
Ralph, your hair is so slippery from cheeseburger grease. Can you hold these rings?

19:23.760 --> 19:27.200
What'd you get? Is it- Ralph, did you give me a McGriddle ring?

19:29.200 --> 19:30.320
You're always there for me, Ralph.

19:30.320 --> 19:33.120
You're always there for me. You're right. I love Susan so much.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.360
Oh, shit. I don't have a wife. You, come here.

19:35.360 --> 19:38.400
Ralph, what's your name?

19:38.400 --> 19:41.840
What's your name? Sislegal? Probably not.

19:41.840 --> 19:49.680
Wait, is her name Sislegal? Why would she be named Sislegal? No one has ever been named that.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.640
I said, is this legal? Not Sislegal.

19:55.520 --> 19:59.840
Come here, Smeagol. I love you. How old are you? Six? Fuck.

19:59.840 --> 20:04.480
Oh, well. You want some fries?

20:04.480 --> 20:07.120
I gotta get my green card. That's all there is to it.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.000
I'm marrying one of you little kids today.

20:11.840 --> 20:15.280
One of you is about to be a seven-year-old divorcee with a Canadian husband,

20:15.920 --> 20:19.360
a Canadian ex. I promise I will let you live your life.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.000
Which one of you has an old soul?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.640
Which one of you has an old soul, like in the luckiest?

20:24.640 --> 20:28.000
I'm gonna need that one because this is gonna be bad otherwise.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.360
I am 45.

20:29.360 --> 20:32.560
I'm 45 years old and I want to stay in America. I love it here.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.480
It's the greatest country on earth, but they will deport me.

20:34.480 --> 20:35.920
Look at the size of these fries.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.760
You can't get extra large fry in Canada.

20:39.760 --> 20:44.880
If I put this extra large fry in your hand, it looks like a bouquet and I'm ready to do this.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.480
I'll throw the fries, honey. No, really don't. They're delicious.

20:48.480 --> 20:53.600
Ronald McDonald's gonna give me away with the purchase of an extra large volume.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.440
He will give me away.

20:57.440 --> 20:57.940
Okay.

20:59.440 --> 21:05.920
Why don't, let me ask you, why can't you marry kids at, hold on, at McDonald's only?

21:06.640 --> 21:07.840
That's the only situation.

21:07.840 --> 21:12.480
So it's only binding in the city state of McDonald's.

21:13.200 --> 21:16.400
Right, in the, yes, in that fiefdom.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.960
Then you leave, you get married to a real woman who is your age,

21:20.960 --> 21:22.480
and she's like, let's go to McDonald's.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.040
Anybody like that?

21:23.040 --> 21:23.520
I can't.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.720
That would be complicated.

21:24.720 --> 21:29.360
We cannot go there. Our relationship that I love and treasure will be null and void.

21:29.360 --> 21:30.880
It will be dissolved.

21:30.880 --> 21:33.680
I know we're goofing about kid preachers, but wouldn't you,

21:33.680 --> 21:36.160
you would have to get married by Grimace, right?

21:37.280 --> 21:40.640
Yeah, he, I mean, he is ordained. I've always thought that he was the holiest.

21:40.640 --> 21:43.600
Wait a minute, or Mayor McCheese.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.400
Oh, it's definitely Mayor McCheese. You want somebody official.

21:47.360 --> 21:47.600
Right.

21:47.600 --> 21:55.840
Grimace is the one who stands up in the back and he's had like one too many McFlurries and he objects.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.760
And the other thing is that

21:57.760 --> 22:01.920
Mayor McCheese is a preacher in that racist church that protests gay people's funerals.

22:01.920 --> 22:02.240
Bet you didn't know that.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.440
That is true.

22:03.440 --> 22:04.000
That's true.

22:04.720 --> 22:08.880
I was about to say in Fred Willard's church, but I don't think that's his name.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.400
The Church of Comedy Goose.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.520
You know who you gotta watch out for?

22:13.520 --> 22:14.880
The Hamburglar.

22:14.880 --> 22:18.800
Yeah, because he'll steal your bride. He'll steal your toddler bride.

22:19.360 --> 22:19.760
He will.

22:21.120 --> 22:24.080
And I'll keep an eye on Dr. Apple Pie.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.480
Okay, you made him up.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.880
No, Dr. Apple Pie, he's a newcomer. Have you not heard of him?

22:30.080 --> 22:33.360
It's a doctor in history. It's not like a medical doctorate.

22:33.360 --> 22:40.000
Everybody in McDonald's is getting so sick from eating McDonald's foods nonstop.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.640
Why do I always feel sleepy and dead?

22:42.640 --> 22:43.140
Uh-huh.

22:44.480 --> 22:49.520
My liver is just like, it's just full of fat. Just full of it.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.920
And it looks like a marbled steak down there.

22:51.920 --> 22:57.920
Can someone please, please invent a caretaker for us peoples?

22:57.920 --> 23:02.480
Also, nobody was buying fucking apple pies anymore because it's not 1952.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.040
So they wanted to get that brand awareness going.

23:05.920 --> 23:09.200
And now they, and now they, apple pies have fruit in them.

23:09.200 --> 23:14.160
Yeah, I'm a doctor. Trust me, you're not a doctor. You're a caretaker.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.120
You're a caretaker.

23:15.120 --> 23:19.840
They have three to 3.5 essential vitamins that you need for life.

23:20.480 --> 23:26.080
Including bread, apple, and syrup. Crunchy.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.400
This has got vitamin syrup. Delicious.

23:30.640 --> 23:34.320
How do you prevent scurvy? That's how. Vitamin crunchy.

23:34.320 --> 23:35.360
A little vitamin syrup.

23:35.360 --> 23:38.480
I like him a lot better than a strange Uncle McRib.

23:40.480 --> 23:40.980
What?

23:41.760 --> 23:44.000
He only comes in town every so often.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.680
Uncle McRib, it's been a while.

23:46.480 --> 23:49.760
Yeah, I was hanging out with your Uncle Bratwurst and your Uncle Pizza.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.240
And your Uncle Fajita for a bit.

23:52.240 --> 23:53.040
They're all dead.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.160
Dr. Apple Pie killed them.

23:58.160 --> 24:02.400
But listen, Ronald, I want you to know I'm clean, I'm sober,

24:02.400 --> 24:03.680
and I'm gonna stick around this time.

24:03.680 --> 24:06.000
I'm gonna be here and I'm gonna be a real member of this family.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.520
Three weeks. Always.

24:07.520 --> 24:08.720
Three weeks he lasts.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.440
He's drunk on the couch. He's making out with Wendy.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.240
And he's back to wherever he goes.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.800
Pulling the tubes out of Grandpa Speedy's nose.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.720
That was a deep McDonald's cut.

24:24.240 --> 24:28.560
Next up, Griffin Goose about McPizza or something.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.400
I already did that one.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.360
God, hey, you know what?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.280
McPizza was good.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.080
McPizza was good.

24:34.080 --> 24:36.320
McBratwurst was fucking delightful.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.600
Okay, Griffin, I've never heard of McBratwurst.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.200
Oh, I remember McBratwurst.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.640
I remember McFajitas too.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.240
I used to always get McFajitas.

24:46.160 --> 24:52.160
Sometimes McDonald's sets their eyes on these, like, fucking like,

24:52.160 --> 24:55.120
Jack in the Box, like their menu is just like freestyle jazz.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.080
Like, what do you want?

24:56.080 --> 24:57.920
Slurpee, sure, fucking throw them in.

24:57.920 --> 25:01.120
McDonald's is like, you guys know your thing already.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.840
You don't have to have, you don't have to have slurpee.

25:03.840 --> 25:04.480
What do you got?

25:04.480 --> 25:05.120
Pasta?

25:05.120 --> 25:06.240
Put that away.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.680
You don't, they don't know what they're doing.

25:07.680 --> 25:10.640
They just want to be involved in another part of your life.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.120
They want to stick their finger in all sorts of pies

25:13.120 --> 25:15.920
because their own pies are the worst pies.

25:15.920 --> 25:17.840
They're like hot pockets of dump.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.560
Have you ever had a holiday pie at McDonald's?

25:20.560 --> 25:23.280
A holiday pie is like an apple pie outside.

25:23.280 --> 25:28.400
It's got sprinkles on top and inside it's filled with, I kid you not, hot custard.

25:28.400 --> 25:31.120
Mmm, happy holidays, everyone.

25:32.800 --> 25:33.760
Happy holidays.

25:34.320 --> 25:35.360
You're crying.

25:35.360 --> 25:36.000
You're sad.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.640
You're so sad.

25:36.640 --> 25:37.040
You're sad.

25:37.040 --> 25:37.440
What's that?

25:37.440 --> 25:38.800
You're eating hot custard pie.

25:38.800 --> 25:39.200
What's that?

25:39.200 --> 25:40.960
It's dribbling down your chin.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.040
Is that hot custard and sprinkles?

25:43.040 --> 25:44.480
Oh, it's December the 24th.

25:45.840 --> 25:46.800
Happy holidays.

25:46.800 --> 25:47.440
Now I get it.

25:47.440 --> 25:48.400
Happy holidays.

25:48.400 --> 25:49.600
You look awful.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.280
I don't think we answered that at all.

25:51.280 --> 25:51.520
Yeah.

25:51.520 --> 25:52.640
I feel like we covered it.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.800
Yeah, we touched on it.

25:55.840 --> 25:56.880
We touched on it.

25:56.880 --> 26:01.200
That's, I mean, the McDonald's play place is a pretty good suggestion, I think.

26:01.200 --> 26:01.520
Yeah.

26:02.400 --> 26:08.800
Where else would be a great place to hitch your wagon to somebody else forever?

26:09.600 --> 26:12.320
You could look into independent concert venues.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.320
Like what?

26:14.880 --> 26:15.440
What?

26:15.440 --> 26:20.160
Like theaters that, you know, that, you know, take, there's one here in Cincinnati called

26:20.160 --> 26:23.680
the Redmore and basically it's like an open event location.

26:23.680 --> 26:25.680
Okay, like an outdoor amphitheater.

26:25.680 --> 26:26.080
I'm with you.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.280
Yeah, that kind of deal.

26:29.760 --> 26:30.400
That's pretty good.

26:31.360 --> 26:34.720
In a church.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.880
In front of the eyes of the Lord.

26:38.880 --> 26:40.240
Maybe you want the Lord to come.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.000
He is everywhere.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.760
Maybe invite your friend God.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.120
Maybe have God come.

26:45.120 --> 26:48.880
You know, God is everywhere except when people are getting married outside of churches.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.320
God is everywhere except outside of churches.

26:52.320 --> 26:59.120
I'll get married, build a big, like, lead line bomb shelter and say no God allowed

26:59.120 --> 27:00.560
because I guess he can't get through lead.

27:03.440 --> 27:04.880
Keep God and Superman out.

27:05.920 --> 27:07.440
Get out of here, Superman.

27:07.440 --> 27:13.760
You know, our step sister Abby got married in a park and that was very nice.

27:13.760 --> 27:14.720
It was lovely.

27:14.720 --> 27:15.120
Yeah.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.320
I mean, it's such a risk.

27:17.120 --> 27:17.600
Yeah.

27:17.600 --> 27:21.840
If it pans out, you know, you've got, well, I was going to say the Lord's blessing, but

27:21.840 --> 27:25.040
obviously you won't have that if you're not in a church, but you have the blessings of Gaia.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.520
Gaia small fire.

27:29.440 --> 27:34.320
I went to a wedding a few months ago in New Orleans at a wax museum.

27:35.680 --> 27:41.760
It was really, really cool because the building was really quite lovely.

27:41.760 --> 27:47.280
And the upstairs is like a reception hall and that's where the reception was,

27:47.280 --> 27:55.520
uh, natch, and I got drunk up there and then went downstairs where all the wax statues were

27:55.520 --> 27:59.760
recounting recounting the history of New Orleans, which I don't know if you guys know.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.520
This is horrifying.

28:02.400 --> 28:05.040
Is the scariest founded city ever.

28:06.080 --> 28:08.000
Did that now these weren't celebs.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.600
These weren't celebs.

28:09.600 --> 28:15.360
These were, uh, historical representations of events.

28:15.360 --> 28:19.760
Like the, the Mexican jail massacre.

28:19.760 --> 28:20.640
All right.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.760
This is pretty good.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.840
I've had about 10 seven and sevens.

28:23.840 --> 28:27.520
So this seems, this seems like a pretty good fit for my current state of being.

28:27.520 --> 28:28.400
Oh, what's that?

28:28.400 --> 28:31.360
Oh, a voodoo ceremony where they tear snakes in half.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.560
Great, great, great.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.760
I always cry at horrifying weddings.

28:35.760 --> 28:36.000
Yeah.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.000
There was also a nightmare done.

28:38.000 --> 28:38.800
I'm not making this up.

28:38.800 --> 28:42.000
There was a nightmare dungeon section for the people who don't give a shit about New

28:42.000 --> 28:47.520
Orleans history and it had like, uh, uh, it had Sasquatch.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.280
It had Frankenstein.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.320
It had Jason.

28:50.960 --> 28:56.960
And, uh, it also had the man in the wax museum, which just stop it.

28:58.640 --> 28:59.760
What I'm not ready.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.280
Man in the wax museum.

29:01.280 --> 29:01.680
Yeah.

29:01.680 --> 29:02.720
It was like two people.

29:02.720 --> 29:03.680
It was just a mirror.

29:04.320 --> 29:04.800
Two people.

29:07.360 --> 29:08.160
Behold.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.920
This is the greatest monster.

29:09.920 --> 29:15.120
You, you know, do you know how, how, uh, much of a lusher you're going to feel like when

29:15.120 --> 29:18.880
we get a call from that wax museum tomorrow and they say, we don't have a nightmare dungeon.

29:18.880 --> 29:25.040
They haven't, we found you crying on the floor of the gift shop.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.920
You were actually on the floor of the gift shop begging for help.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.680
There is no nightmare dungeon here that, oh, I'm sorry.

29:31.680 --> 29:35.040
That was the, that was the origins of Mardi Gras exhibit.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.440
There were a lot of feathered masks.

29:37.440 --> 29:41.120
Girls who have to go wild forever in perpetuity.

29:41.120 --> 29:43.520
They will, they're locked in a state of wildness.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.120
We'd like just one quiet night.

29:45.120 --> 29:48.640
I don't think that's, I just want to stay in and watch the bachelor with Steph.

29:49.600 --> 29:52.480
Justin, did you watch, did you watch the bachelor?

29:52.480 --> 29:54.720
Is this why you've referenced it four different times?

29:55.280 --> 29:55.780
No.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.200
Well, it's tied.

29:57.200 --> 30:00.880
This, the bachelor is tied to the fiction of Lady Gaga at home.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.720
So the two are being mentioned in conjunction.

30:02.720 --> 30:05.920
I'm only asking because I watched every single episode of the bachelor.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.560
This season, I was hoping we might have bro chats about it.

30:08.560 --> 30:11.280
Did she end up with the, did he end up with the bad girl?

30:11.280 --> 30:12.320
I don't want to spoil it.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.960
So take your earphones off everybody.

30:14.960 --> 30:15.460
Yup.

30:16.960 --> 30:17.680
Really?

30:17.680 --> 30:18.180
Yeah.

30:18.800 --> 30:19.760
I'm glad I didn't watch it.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.720
That would have been hard.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.400
It was rough.

30:23.120 --> 30:26.640
He got, he got rid of KCB, America's sweetheart.

30:26.640 --> 30:29.040
Like, like four episodes from the end.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.640
Like what are you doing, brother?

30:30.640 --> 30:31.680
See, now they're married.

30:31.680 --> 30:34.640
I've never watched the bachelor before, but now that he's made his film,

30:34.640 --> 30:37.360
but now that he's made his final choice, they're married.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.160
No dog.

30:38.160 --> 30:41.680
They went totally Splitsville almost instantly.

30:41.680 --> 30:42.800
Then what's the point?

30:42.800 --> 30:44.400
What is the point, Travis, of love?

30:46.480 --> 30:51.840
If love can't thrive in a reality TV show or at McDonald's, then what's the point?

30:51.840 --> 30:54.320
Or a reality TV show set at McDonald's.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.920
I would watch that.

30:55.920 --> 30:56.240
I know.

30:56.240 --> 30:57.120
Oh my God.

30:57.120 --> 30:59.200
In a play place, you're just, it's like sister wise.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.280
On the next episode of kid marriage.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.600
We're canceled.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.320
Sorry, police.

31:06.320 --> 31:07.120
We did not know.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.680
On the next episode of kid wives,

31:11.680 --> 31:14.480
we formally apologize to the families we've devastated.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.040
We did not know about the laws.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.720
On the next episode of kid wives,

31:18.720 --> 31:21.760
we do an unintentional mashup with to catch a predator.

31:24.800 --> 31:25.840
Is that Chris Hansen?

31:25.840 --> 31:26.880
Ah, fuck.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.560
God damn it.

31:28.560 --> 31:29.360
I love her very much.

31:29.360 --> 31:32.240
I love her very much.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.840
I just like Smirnoff.

31:33.840 --> 31:35.120
I like to drink it myself.

31:35.680 --> 31:36.640
This is for me.

31:36.640 --> 31:37.920
This Smirnoff is for me.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.200
I bought this for me.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.800
I bought this for me, Chris.

31:40.800 --> 31:41.200
I bought it for-

31:41.200 --> 31:44.240
This is a treat for me because I had a hard drive here.

31:44.240 --> 31:45.360
I've earned it.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.000
Oh, I haven't?

31:46.000 --> 31:46.960
I'm a pedo?

31:47.520 --> 31:47.840
Okay.

31:48.560 --> 31:54.320
If you are going to go to an underage girl's house to sleep with her,

31:54.320 --> 31:57.840
and you are bringing a lot of alcoholic beverages, don't do that.

31:57.840 --> 32:01.200
But if you do, take two cups with you.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.440
Because when he asks you what the Z was for,

32:03.440 --> 32:05.280
it is such a baller move to say,

32:05.280 --> 32:06.640
it's for us, Chris.

32:06.640 --> 32:07.840
Let's sit down.

32:07.840 --> 32:09.200
Let's crack one of these open.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.320
This one's for us, big guy.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.040
Let's bro out.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.000
This is for us.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.920
You never get to hang with anybody.

32:13.920 --> 32:16.800
You just sit in kitchens all day like a creepster.

32:16.800 --> 32:17.440
Yeah, no, Chris.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.480
Chris, I'll go quietly.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.680
But let's talk about you.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.440
Chris, I'm your biggest fan.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.760
I got into touching kids just for this moment.

32:23.760 --> 32:24.480
Just to meet you.

32:25.040 --> 32:25.360
Love you.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.160
Just for this moment.

32:26.160 --> 32:26.880
I love you so much.

32:26.880 --> 32:27.920
You do such good work.

32:27.920 --> 32:30.080
Peto's gross, but I'll become one.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.120
To meet you.

32:31.120 --> 32:31.760
To meet you.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.480
Oh, Peto's, you're the pit.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.920
You know how we catch predators?

32:37.920 --> 32:58.320
That's what the money we earn from the money's at?

32:58.320 --> 32:59.680
We're out there every day.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.440
When we're not recording these podcasts,

33:01.440 --> 33:03.040
we're busting Peto's.

33:03.040 --> 33:03.680
Yeah.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.040
A lot of people know that.

33:05.040 --> 33:08.880
This message is for Merrily Bramblepelt Griffin

33:08.880 --> 33:11.360
and Holly Lillipad Gibbs.

33:11.360 --> 33:14.320
And it's from Nadja, Will, and Tom.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.040
Travis, what's the message?

33:17.600 --> 33:20.240
Well, I can give you what I'm guessing

33:20.240 --> 33:22.400
is the first nine tenths of the message

33:22.400 --> 33:24.400
because unfortunately it cut off.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.160
But here's what we've got so far.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.400
We would like to give a birthday shout out

33:28.400 --> 33:30.800
to the almost twin mayors of Birthday Town,

33:30.800 --> 33:33.760
Merrily Bramblepelt Griffin, March 16th,

33:33.760 --> 33:36.400
and Holly Lillipad Gibbs, March 23rd.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.240
Holly and Merrily are super fans

33:38.240 --> 33:39.360
of my brother, my brother, and me

33:39.360 --> 33:41.760
and been spreading the McElroy Brothers gospel

33:41.760 --> 33:43.600
since they started listening to The Advice Show.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.800
Our quintet has been getting it every...

33:47.520 --> 33:49.280
And then the message cuts off.

33:49.280 --> 33:49.600
Okay.

33:50.480 --> 33:50.960
Okay.

33:50.960 --> 33:51.440
So.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.040
Hold on, we can figure this out.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.040
Our quintet has been getting it in every...

33:56.320 --> 33:57.120
Back alley.

33:57.120 --> 33:57.520
No.

33:57.520 --> 33:58.400
Oh, God, no.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.120
No, no, no, no, no.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.200
That's the worst thing you could have said.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.560
It's the worst answer.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.880
I want you guys to know that I censored myself

34:04.880 --> 34:06.800
for the other terrible things I was going to say.

34:06.800 --> 34:07.680
Oh, good.

34:07.680 --> 34:08.560
Wonderful.

34:08.560 --> 34:12.560
You get that in NBNBAM XXL.

34:12.560 --> 34:13.520
Get raunchy.

34:13.520 --> 34:16.000
You guys say the rump.

34:18.240 --> 34:19.760
Good one, Dirty Dram.

34:19.760 --> 34:23.040
You skunked him again in your dirty ways.

34:23.040 --> 34:25.360
This is the best CD I ever bought.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.480
How is this only $3?

34:27.200 --> 34:30.320
NBNBAM XXL get raunchy.

34:30.320 --> 34:32.640
Why is it extra large?

34:32.640 --> 34:33.440
Because it's so dirty.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.920
Because it can't contain all the raunchiness, Griffin.

34:36.640 --> 34:38.800
The raunchiness is bulging at the seams.

34:38.800 --> 34:42.320
No one CD can contain all that raunchiness.

34:42.320 --> 34:44.960
The corporate suit said make two CDs.

34:44.960 --> 34:46.720
We made a giant one.

34:46.720 --> 34:51.200
It looks like a laser disc of raunchiness.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.000
Of raunchy.

34:53.120 --> 34:54.240
You can't fit it in anything?

34:54.240 --> 34:55.280
Fit it in your rump.

34:57.280 --> 34:57.920
It's brad.

34:57.920 --> 35:00.960
Is it your grandma's CD?

35:02.240 --> 35:03.600
Sorry, people.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.720
Turn it down.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.080
Too much raunch.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.160
So happy birthday.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.280
Happy birthday.

35:09.280 --> 35:11.840
Sorry about everything.

35:11.840 --> 35:12.800
Sorry about Travis.

35:12.800 --> 35:13.680
Specifically me.

35:13.680 --> 35:14.240
I'm so sorry.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.760
And hey, don't forget, MaxFunDrive's coming up.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.720
Get your get your given hat on.

35:20.720 --> 35:26.240
Because we are planning a salvo of awesome shit

35:26.240 --> 35:28.880
to give away to people.

35:28.880 --> 35:30.240
I'm gonna throw our hat over the fence.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.080
It's okay.

35:32.080 --> 35:32.960
It'll change you.

35:33.920 --> 35:34.640
Whoa.

35:34.640 --> 35:36.320
In ways you can't even imagine.

35:36.320 --> 35:36.720
You will.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.240
Well, you can probably suss it out.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.640
But you will be changed.

35:40.640 --> 35:41.520
You will be defined.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.000
And for the better, you ask?

35:44.800 --> 35:45.280
I don't know.

35:45.280 --> 35:46.080
Not necessarily.

35:46.080 --> 35:47.120
It's impossible to say.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.120
I know what will change you for the better.

35:49.120 --> 35:52.400
It's another show on the Maximum Fun Network.

35:53.440 --> 35:54.080
Like this one.

35:54.080 --> 35:56.320
Hello, fake radio listeners.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.400
I didn't see you over there.

35:58.400 --> 36:01.760
This is Judge John Hodgman relaxing in his chambers.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.320
You know, I've resolved the greatest moral conflicts of our time,

36:04.320 --> 36:07.360
like the potluck problem, snob versus slob,

36:07.360 --> 36:09.440
and of course the toot dispute.

36:09.440 --> 36:12.960
Do you have a pressing issue that needs swift, decisive justice?

36:12.960 --> 36:19.120
Visit us at www.maximumfun.org slash JJHO.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.240
That's JJHO for Judge John Hodgman.

36:22.240 --> 36:25.520
And here are the results of each case on my weekly podcast,

36:25.520 --> 36:26.720
Judge John Hodgman.

You can subscribe in iTunes or find it online at www.maximumfun.org.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.200
This is the sound of a gavel.

36:34.240 --> 36:34.800
That is all.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.000
I have a Yahoo answer that was sent in by gollyayolly.

36:38.000 --> 36:38.560
Thank you, golly.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kevin Crawford, who asks,

36:43.760 --> 36:46.720
if I go to Italy and talk with an Italian accent,

36:46.720 --> 36:48.320
would I offend the Italians?

36:48.320 --> 36:52.400
I'm going to Germany, Austria, and Italy, May 23rd for 11 days.

36:52.400 --> 36:55.120
I just wanted to ask, I talk with an Italian accent,

36:55.120 --> 36:56.960
but don't speak Italians.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.720
Would the Italians find that offensive?

37:00.480 --> 37:02.240
I can't imagine why.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.040
Why would they?

37:04.080 --> 37:05.920
I think they'll find it flattering.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.160
They might think they're having a stroke.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.840
Why do I understand?

37:11.840 --> 37:13.920
I don't understand what you're saying.

37:13.920 --> 37:14.960
But it's Italian.

37:14.960 --> 37:15.680
It's Italian.

37:15.680 --> 37:16.240
It's Italian.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.560
I don't understand what you're saying, but it's Italian.

37:18.560 --> 37:19.680
It's got to be.

37:19.680 --> 37:20.720
It's got to be Italian.

37:20.720 --> 37:21.440
Look at you.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.880
What are these new words?

37:22.880 --> 37:23.760
God, the kids.

37:23.760 --> 37:24.880
He's an innovator.

37:24.880 --> 37:28.240
He's a pioneer of the Italian language.

37:28.240 --> 37:29.280
I don't understand any of it.

37:30.240 --> 37:32.640
You douchebag.

37:32.640 --> 37:35.200
This you doucher.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.840
This is either like you either are planning on doing this,

37:37.840 --> 37:40.800
which is bad, or you already speak with an Italian accent,

37:41.840 --> 37:44.560
but you don't speak Italian and your name is Kevin,

37:44.560 --> 37:47.120
not from Italy originally.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.360
Do you know why people have accents?

37:49.360 --> 37:50.400
Do you know how that happens?

37:50.400 --> 37:52.400
Because they're from the place, Kevin.

37:54.160 --> 37:55.440
Jesus, Kevin.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.160
Kevin, you are from Nebraska.

37:58.160 --> 37:59.840
You speak with a Nebraska accent.

38:01.120 --> 38:02.400
An Nebraska brogue.

38:02.400 --> 38:05.200
I've never been to a foreign country,

38:05.200 --> 38:08.640
but I have to imagine that it would be the same

38:08.640 --> 38:12.080
as if anyone from Italy rolled up to America.

38:12.080 --> 38:15.600
It was like, now I'm going to speak with an American accent.

38:16.960 --> 38:19.040
I don't hope for that.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.560
It wouldn't be a thing because I don't think-

38:20.560 --> 38:23.600
It would be like, como esta mi amigo?

38:24.960 --> 38:27.200
Donde esta la biblioteca?

38:27.200 --> 38:28.640
I'm no Espana.

38:29.360 --> 38:31.760
Donde esta la biblioteca?

38:33.600 --> 38:35.200
Can't tell me, amigo.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.240
I sound like the DNA strand in that part.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.640
Yes, you do.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.480
Dinosaur me amigo.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.360
De ñ a a.

38:48.880 --> 38:51.760
Es tu amigo.

38:53.840 --> 38:55.200
Oh my God.

38:55.200 --> 38:59.600
Donde esta los thunder lizards?

39:05.600 --> 39:08.480
Vim con amigo a Jurassic Park.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.680
¿Qué es tu nombre?

39:11.680 --> 39:14.320
Mi nombre es Jose Hammond.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.920
¿Qué es lo problema, amigo?

39:20.880 --> 39:22.160
Tassera tops.

39:33.360 --> 39:37.280
I wish I knew more Spanish, but I don't know any.

39:37.280 --> 39:40.480
I know how to ask for the library or maybe bookstore.

39:41.280 --> 39:45.360
I know how to say bathroom and Mr. Ian Malcolm.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.080
Mepa finds a way.

39:54.400 --> 39:54.900
Christ.

39:56.880 --> 39:59.680
Yeah, oh God, don't do this thing, Kevin.

40:00.400 --> 40:03.840
Kevin, just go to Italy and enjoy it and talk like yourself.

40:03.840 --> 40:07.920
Yeah, just go and talk really loudly and slowly in English.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.600
Yeah, that's what people like over there.

40:09.600 --> 40:12.400
They want the one thing people always say this.

40:12.400 --> 40:15.680
Why should I try to speak in the language even if I don't know it?

40:15.680 --> 40:17.360
And the answer is yes, always.

40:17.360 --> 40:20.880
Because the one thing that people in other countries like to feel is superior to you.

40:20.880 --> 40:21.600
Oh, yeah.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.000
And if they can't kind of tilt their head to the side.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.600
Okay, come here little slow person.

40:27.600 --> 40:28.480
Come with me.

40:28.480 --> 40:29.360
You're adorable.

40:30.240 --> 40:31.120
I'll protect you.

40:31.120 --> 40:31.920
I don't know.

40:31.920 --> 40:35.520
They might actually appreciate the comedy of this.

40:36.800 --> 40:37.520
You think?

40:37.520 --> 40:37.840
Yeah.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.840
Like, hello, I'm trying to go up and a sandwich.

40:42.480 --> 40:43.040
Which way?

40:43.040 --> 40:43.840
Tell me, please.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.040
Why is the Italian Borat?

40:50.080 --> 40:52.880
My brother, my brother, me come for the child marriage.

40:52.880 --> 40:53.920
Stay for the accents.

40:55.360 --> 40:57.600
Oh, like you guys could do a better Italian.

40:57.600 --> 40:59.440
Griffin, I did Mexican.

40:59.440 --> 41:04.480
I didn't Mexican English DNA DNA.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.000
So yeah, I could probably swing it.

41:06.960 --> 41:10.560
I'm not just not going to lower myself to that because it's offensive to Tony Danza

41:10.560 --> 41:13.760
and all the other fine people of the Italian faith.

41:15.280 --> 41:19.840
And we can all agree that Kevin's Italian accent is he's just doing Mario, right?

41:19.840 --> 41:20.960
Yeah, right.

41:20.960 --> 41:23.280
Okay, it's me, Kevin.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.240
He just comes out.

41:24.240 --> 41:27.920
Every other American is doing when they do Italian Mario.

41:27.920 --> 41:28.880
I'm a Kevin.

41:28.880 --> 41:29.920
I'm going to win.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.560
Or the something about spicy people.

41:35.120 --> 41:39.360
This seems to be the two things that everyone says in their Italian accents.

41:40.000 --> 41:46.000
Here's a Yahoo answer that was sent in by Keith Marnock.

41:46.000 --> 41:46.720
Thank you, Keith.

41:47.840 --> 41:52.960
It's by Yahoo answers user Matilda, who asks opinions on the name baby for a girl.

41:54.240 --> 41:55.760
I'm sorry, but I love this name.

41:55.760 --> 41:59.840
It is so graceful, elegant and formal upper class name and all caps.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.480
I want to call my kid.

42:02.480 --> 42:04.080
I want to call my kid this please.

42:04.080 --> 42:04.960
Opinions, please.

42:05.840 --> 42:09.280
I think anytime you have to ask a question that starts with I'm sorry,

42:09.280 --> 42:10.640
you've answered it for yourself.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.760
Yeah, that's that's a fine point, Travis.

42:15.440 --> 42:17.520
So what I'm sorry, I have this opinion.

42:18.080 --> 42:18.960
I'm so sorry.

42:19.760 --> 42:21.440
You can't what in what?

42:21.440 --> 42:29.440
What OK, if you think about class, the idea of class, it is tied pretty much in, you know.

42:30.880 --> 42:35.840
Inherently to maturity, you know, classy, mature.

42:36.880 --> 42:43.440
How could a name that means the least mature thing be a classy name?

42:43.440 --> 42:46.960
So like, let's let's walk this backwards.

42:46.960 --> 42:48.560
Can you name your child grandpa?

42:48.560 --> 42:51.840
This is for a girl.

42:51.840 --> 42:53.840
This is my baby, Grandpa Baby.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.760
I love him very much.

42:55.760 --> 42:56.720
He's a classy guy.

42:56.720 --> 42:57.840
You know, baby.

42:58.640 --> 43:01.200
What I'm picturing it and just makes you really happy.

43:01.200 --> 43:02.320
A grandpa baby.

43:02.320 --> 43:03.040
So I go on.

43:03.040 --> 43:08.320
No, this is I love it when you interrupt the show with your own brain pictures that nobody can see.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.520
Tell me again, does it please you?

43:14.080 --> 43:16.560
Are you imagining a still frame from Benjamin Button?

43:16.560 --> 43:22.000
Are you looking in your commemorative Benjamin Button view master that you receive at the screen?

43:22.000 --> 43:22.960
Yes.

43:22.960 --> 43:24.160
Click click.

43:24.160 --> 43:24.880
He's older.

43:24.880 --> 43:25.440
Click click.

43:25.440 --> 43:26.320
He's young.

43:26.320 --> 43:27.520
I love this view master.

43:29.200 --> 43:30.400
Why is the writing backwards?

43:30.400 --> 43:32.480
Ah, fuck the things in backwards.

43:32.480 --> 43:35.360
But these are so hard with those.

43:35.360 --> 43:39.680
Do you think do you guys think view masters would still have the power to entertain and

43:39.680 --> 43:40.800
insource all the youth?

43:40.800 --> 43:44.320
Or do you think their their novelty will have worn off?

43:44.320 --> 43:46.560
I don't understand the thing that doesn't exist anymore.

43:46.560 --> 43:48.160
They don't make view masters anymore.

43:48.160 --> 43:53.440
They probably do for like the the toddler is toddlers and hipsters.

43:54.560 --> 43:55.920
Yeah, I could see that.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.480
It's like a disk of PBR pictures.

43:58.480 --> 44:00.960
These are real things that people spent money on.

44:02.000 --> 44:09.200
And I imagine that the replay value on a view master disk is negative 10.

44:10.160 --> 44:11.200
You flip through it.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.000
There's eight pictures.

44:12.000 --> 44:12.800
You flip through all eight.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.240
You're like done.

44:14.240 --> 44:15.360
Thank you for buying this dad.

44:15.360 --> 44:16.000
How much was it?

44:16.000 --> 44:16.720
250?

44:16.720 --> 44:17.280
Yowza.

44:18.960 --> 44:20.000
You got burnt dad.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.560
Would have maybe spent that on milk or gas.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.080
But this is great.

44:24.080 --> 44:24.400
Thanks.

44:24.960 --> 44:26.960
It lasted me four and a half seconds.

44:26.960 --> 44:27.520
So thanks.

44:28.560 --> 44:30.480
It was really it was really super fun.

44:30.480 --> 44:31.280
Next toy.

44:33.680 --> 44:36.640
Again, something with electricity, please.

44:37.360 --> 44:39.760
Can I get a light bright up in this bitch?

44:39.760 --> 44:45.600
Man, don't name your fucking baby baby because that baby is never going to grow up.

44:45.600 --> 44:46.880
It's going to be a forever baby.

44:47.760 --> 44:50.000
That baby is never going to grow up that baby.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.360
If that baby is a is it a baby girl, baby boy doesn't name it.

44:53.360 --> 44:54.160
Baby girl.

44:54.160 --> 44:55.920
Let's say baby girl for a girl.

44:56.880 --> 44:58.960
Oh, right in the question right there in bold.

45:00.960 --> 45:01.840
Don't do this.

45:02.640 --> 45:05.680
This baby is going to be 15 and it's going to hate you already.

45:05.680 --> 45:07.280
But you know, it's going to make it double hate you.

45:07.280 --> 45:08.640
You know, it's going to make it double hate you.

45:09.600 --> 45:10.720
So when you go, hey, baby.

45:14.160 --> 45:15.760
Bring me down my socks, baby.

45:15.760 --> 45:17.520
Give me socks, baby.

45:17.520 --> 45:18.720
Give my drinking socks.

45:20.880 --> 45:22.480
No, they're next to the meth socks.

45:22.480 --> 45:25.280
So next to my meth doing socks, baby.

45:27.120 --> 45:33.840
You know, you people get mad at adults who wear diapers as part of a sexual or, you know,

45:33.840 --> 45:34.880
sexual pleasure thing.

45:34.880 --> 45:35.840
Oh, you mean age play?

45:35.840 --> 45:39.520
Age, people get mad about age play.

45:39.520 --> 45:46.400
But I think if your name is baby, you pretty much have carte blanche of for sexual dysfunction.

45:47.280 --> 45:49.120
Not to say it's a dysfunction.

45:49.120 --> 45:54.960
It is a it is a perfectly viable, erotic alley.

45:54.960 --> 45:59.920
All of the cronosexuals out there, like you keep chasing your dream.

45:59.920 --> 46:02.880
And like, we are not going to stand in the way because who are we?

46:02.880 --> 46:08.240
Um, but you should stop listening right now because that's gross.

46:10.400 --> 46:12.640
The big diapers aren't what bother me.

46:12.640 --> 46:13.600
What's a pacifier?

46:13.600 --> 46:14.640
Is it a pacifier?

46:14.640 --> 46:16.320
For me, it's the goo goo's and the gaga.

46:16.320 --> 46:17.520
See, for me, it's the bonnet.

46:18.640 --> 46:20.000
I can't get behind the bonnet.

46:20.720 --> 46:24.000
Yeah, it it and it always is a big fat man.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.440
It always looks like someone put a diaper on a giant egg.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.200
Now and I hate it.

46:29.200 --> 46:30.000
I hate it too.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.080
But if they put it in a Cirque du Soleil, I'd pay $100 to see it.

46:34.080 --> 46:35.600
I would pay $100 to see it.

46:36.160 --> 46:40.560
So oh, so what you're saying is you have a problem with amateur baby dress up,

46:40.560 --> 46:42.720
but professional baby dress up is fine.

46:42.720 --> 46:45.840
Professional age play is is a is a sight to behold.

46:45.840 --> 46:52.080
If I saw a fat man in public and he was wearing a diaper and a very snug shirt

46:53.520 --> 46:56.960
that looked like a weird fucked up version of Jack the movie

46:56.960 --> 47:00.320
Jack by somebody who had never seen the movie Jack but was told to recreate it.

47:01.360 --> 47:07.520
Um, I would get angry at that scene until I said, Hey, brother, what's your name?

47:07.520 --> 47:09.120
He said, My parents named me baby.

47:09.120 --> 47:10.720
Then I would say, I get it.

47:10.720 --> 47:12.240
I get I understand everything.

47:12.240 --> 47:13.440
Everything is illuminated.

47:14.080 --> 47:15.200
My love is your love.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.160
My I'm with you.

47:16.160 --> 47:16.960
I miss you, Whitney.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.400
Um, I kind of get it a little bit.

47:22.400 --> 47:22.960
Hold on.

47:22.960 --> 47:26.640
The baby naming a baby on one level.

47:26.640 --> 47:28.640
Okay, what's the one level once you get it?

47:28.640 --> 47:32.640
Travis is that when you have this baby, if you're a stupid person,

47:32.640 --> 47:35.360
you look at it and go, this is a baby.

47:36.000 --> 47:40.240
Like, but what I what I can't envision doing is looking at a baby and saying,

47:40.240 --> 47:41.840
like, this is a Eustace.

47:41.840 --> 47:45.120
Yeah, this is a Hortense.

47:45.120 --> 47:49.200
But that you realize that that's not how people don't look at their babies and just go pizza.

47:51.040 --> 47:52.800
No, I'm saying in the naming process.

47:52.800 --> 47:55.040
It's a really difficult thing because you're looking at this thing.

47:55.040 --> 47:57.520
This baby and saying, like, I'm going to label this thing for,

47:57.520 --> 47:59.280
you know, possibly 100 years.

47:59.280 --> 47:59.920
What's this thing?

48:00.640 --> 48:01.120
What's this thing?

48:01.840 --> 48:02.960
Is this Doritos?

48:02.960 --> 48:04.000
Nah, table?

48:04.000 --> 48:04.560
Nope.

48:04.560 --> 48:05.520
No, it's a baby.

48:06.320 --> 48:07.840
Put that down on the certificate.

48:08.480 --> 48:14.240
Are you saying that it's okay if you as a parent lack the conceptual

48:14.960 --> 48:21.200
the the ability to abstract a baby from like to it to an actual name?

48:21.200 --> 48:22.240
Like, yeah, you can't.

48:22.240 --> 48:25.120
I'm saying that if you have to go on Yahoo Answers Question and ask,

48:25.760 --> 48:28.960
then chances are you're lucky the baby's not named Doritos.

48:29.600 --> 48:31.520
This is my baby Doritos.

48:31.520 --> 48:32.880
This is a Doritos.

48:32.880 --> 48:33.520
It's not though.

48:33.520 --> 48:34.720
Two A's on the certificate.

48:36.320 --> 48:41.840
Stepping up to the plate, it's Doritos Atkins.

48:43.120 --> 48:45.120
He's had a hell of a season.

48:45.120 --> 48:48.720
And earlier when I said plate, I meant podium because he's the president.

48:49.760 --> 48:50.720
He's the baseball president.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.880
President Doritos Taco Bell Shell.

48:54.240 --> 48:58.480
Our baby president is also a baseballman.

48:59.280 --> 48:59.920
Doritos.

49:01.040 --> 49:04.720
He goes by one name now, like Madonna or Kony.

49:05.280 --> 49:06.320
Just Doritos.

49:08.400 --> 49:10.000
So this has been our dumb show.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.120
My brother, my brother and me.

49:11.120 --> 49:11.920
We gotta stop.

49:11.920 --> 49:13.760
We gotta stop Doritos 2012.

49:13.760 --> 49:16.560
We can't stop Doritos 2012.

49:16.560 --> 49:17.120
Bring him down.

49:17.120 --> 49:23.840
Uh, thank you so much for, for listening to it and hopefully making it to the end of this very,

49:24.640 --> 49:28.960
very strange episode in what is already a pretty strange show.

49:28.960 --> 49:35.280
Um, if you would like more, go to iTunes, search for NBNBAM and you can find

49:35.680 --> 49:40.880
95 episodes of this stuff and you can listen to all of them and maybe leave us a rating or

49:40.880 --> 49:42.240
a review while you're there.

49:42.240 --> 49:46.160
Subscribe there and, um, spread that, spread that around.

49:46.160 --> 49:50.160
That's the best way you have of growing the show and making sure others get to enjoy it.

49:50.160 --> 49:55.920
Um, uh, and remember coming up is, uh, max fun drive and you're going to help support

49:55.920 --> 50:00.400
all the shows of max fun, including our new shows, uh, bullseye and throwing shade and

50:00.400 --> 50:03.840
us because you love us and you want to buy us things and be nice to us.

50:03.840 --> 50:09.440
We have been on the network for a year and, uh, it was, you know, a year ago that we did

50:09.440 --> 50:15.920
the last max one drive and the extent to which we have grown and been able to do new stuff.

50:15.920 --> 50:19.280
Because of the people who supported us last year, like thank you guys so, so much.

50:19.280 --> 50:23.040
We don't thank you enough, uh, for, for the people who, who already are donating, but

50:23.040 --> 50:27.440
it's been absolutely incredible and we couldn't have done it, uh, without everybody's support.

50:27.440 --> 50:31.520
So, uh, hopefully, uh, people will come out this year and we'll be able to grow even

50:31.520 --> 50:34.240
more into 20 Bakers Does.

50:34.240 --> 50:38.160
Thank you, John Roderick, the long winners for letting us use their song.

50:38.160 --> 50:41.520
It's a departure, uh, from the album, putting the days to bed.

50:41.520 --> 50:46.160
You can find that on all your music outlets.

50:46.160 --> 50:51.920
Thank you to everyone who tweets about, uh, the long winters, uh, for attaching the MBMBAM

50:51.920 --> 50:52.960
hashtag.

50:52.960 --> 50:57.120
I don't know why you guys attach the MBMBAM hashtag to some of the things you attach it

50:57.120 --> 51:00.640
to, but God bless you because it makes that stream.

51:00.640 --> 51:05.600
If you don't have that, that, uh, that stream saved in Twitter, it is, uh, it gets pretty

51:05.600 --> 51:06.640
rambunctious in there.

51:06.640 --> 51:14.720
If you use the MBMBAM, uh, hashtag, uh, thank you to everybody tweeting about the show this

51:14.720 --> 51:15.760
week with that.

51:15.760 --> 51:24.000

51:51.120 --> 51:51.840
Let's shut it down.

51:52.800 --> 51:53.600
Let's shut it down.

51:54.160 --> 51:56.000
This final Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holofield.

51:56.000 --> 51:56.640
Thank you, Lisa.

51:56.640 --> 52:02.560
