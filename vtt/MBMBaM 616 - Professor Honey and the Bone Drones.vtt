WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

Say I missed the time when I could fucking say

02:09.840 --> 02:12.860
Anything and I didn't have to think about other people

02:12.860 --> 02:18.740
Or like what my audience thought and so I'm so glad finally

02:18.740 --> 02:24.100
We have someone standing up for transgressive comedy. Yeah challenges our ideas

02:24.100 --> 02:30.300
So I can't wait to see what kind of challenging the status quo man versus

02:31.220 --> 02:33.220

Netflix. Okay. Okay, if you're rowing. Yeah, I would love this

02:59.260 --> 03:00.740
Buzz buzz

Roni in I got you go for bean

03:04.580 --> 03:06.580

03:06.580 --> 03:14.260
Classic and that is exactly the kind of magic. We're hoping you can capture today in your interviews about our

03:15.260 --> 03:19.540
Project man versus be. Oh, yeah for sure for sure

03:20.420 --> 03:26.220
So I brought in just so we can like kind of make sure we're on the same page. I've brought in

03:26.940 --> 03:28.340
You know

03:28.340 --> 03:31.940
David Sims from the Atlantic. Oh, we're good

03:31.940 --> 03:38.900
Bros, you're David. Oh, hi. It's me David Sims. So David has been kind enough to sort of do a

03:39.700 --> 03:46.100
I sort of mock interview if that's if we could try that. Oh, yeah, you know, you know

03:46.100 --> 03:51.940
You don't think I'm ready for the real deal. I know you are. I know you are rowing

03:52.780 --> 03:55.180
Oh, I just really want to keep it laser

03:55.780 --> 03:59.900
Yeah, so I'm just gonna I'm gonna start off with a real softball here rowing

03:59.900 --> 04:01.260
Ha ha

04:01.260 --> 04:06.180
What what is it that you think makes man versus be such a great comment?

04:06.180 --> 04:11.840
Well, I was talking to my good friend Ricky Gervais the other day

04:12.700 --> 04:16.660
Okay, I was talking to him about

04:17.500 --> 04:18.660
comedy

04:18.660 --> 04:20.660
Yeah, okay. So what makes me ever

04:21.620 --> 04:27.460
This is going I was about to say so good, but like Ricky's actually been in a little bit of a

04:27.460 --> 04:31.980
I mean, we love him over here at Netflix can't get enough of them

04:31.980 --> 04:36.340
Yeah, so I think actually it's all going fine. So yeah, no notes

04:43.580 --> 04:46.860
I've prepared a statement. Oh, okay

04:47.340 --> 04:50.660
That doesn't normally happen in interviews. But yeah, go ahead Rowan

04:50.660 --> 04:57.780
It does seem to be that the job of comedy is to offend or have the potential to offend and it can't I'm

04:58.260 --> 05:00.260
becoming Austrian

05:01.700 --> 05:05.260
Well, you're very you're very transformative as an actor row and

05:06.220 --> 05:08.960
So what it wait, so what did you say about the job of comedy?

05:09.060 --> 05:14.260
It's to make a people angry and you say you can't punch down

05:14.540 --> 05:19.760
But what if that's the closest thing to you? Well, hold on Rowan

05:19.760 --> 05:24.800
It's the job of easier punch down the job of comedy is to make people

05:25.880 --> 05:26.880
gravity

05:26.880 --> 05:31.280
But that seemed Rowan isn't the job of comedy to make people happy and laugh

05:31.960 --> 05:35.920
Well, I was talking to my good friend best friend

05:36.840 --> 05:40.040
Then he was a group sort of my wedding Richard Gervais

05:42.680 --> 05:43.920
And

05:43.920 --> 05:50.240
He we were having a lot of laughs. We were watching his special. I was busting the fuck up at all of it and

05:50.920 --> 05:53.360
I've got me thinking I

05:54.400 --> 05:59.880
Should be able to tell a joke about anything I want with no repercussions whatsoever. Mr. Bain

06:00.880 --> 06:07.080
Well, that's that seems like a big ask Rowan and I do also feel like sorry we're drifting away

06:07.880 --> 06:09.880
from the focus

06:09.880 --> 06:16.040
Ah the beers it represents woke culture. Oh

06:16.580 --> 06:18.580
What? Yeah

06:18.660 --> 06:25.000
This is a scoop. So you're telling me that what the movie actually is is man versus woke culture

06:25.660 --> 06:27.140
kind of

06:27.140 --> 06:29.660
but it also but it's also like

06:30.700 --> 06:32.700
getting older

06:32.700 --> 06:40.700
Like it's me versus getting older and I was and I could squeeze it a kid getting older with a big flame

06:40.700 --> 06:42.700
Throw and say what?

06:43.020 --> 06:48.040
No, no, please. I believe very much. I think I think what he I think what?

06:49.020 --> 06:53.780
Sir Rowan is saying here. Oh, he's got the knighthood when you're fighting a bee

06:53.780 --> 07:02.900
You can't really punch up or down cuz it's flying around so much that you're just punching every which way in that and starting on it at all

07:02.900 --> 07:06.460
I'm and knocking over vases. I think is another great

07:06.460 --> 07:12.060
Oh, so it's like a literal like okay that it's a literal punching right Rowan

07:14.020 --> 07:16.020
I'm just saying

07:16.020 --> 07:23.900
That it seems to me the job of comedies to offend or have potential to offend and it cannot be drained of that

07:23.900 --> 07:25.060
potential

07:25.060 --> 07:32.100
Every joke has a victim. That's the definition of every let and let me make sure you get this quote

07:32.340 --> 07:38.900
Which is the most bonkers shit I've ever said or anyone really getting word-for-word

07:39.540 --> 07:43.700
Every joke has a victim. That's the definition of a joke

07:43.700 --> 07:45.700
No

07:48.340 --> 07:50.340
Every joke has a

07:50.460 --> 07:56.300
Victim and that's and the rest of the quote that I didn't I'm not going to say off the record

07:56.300 --> 08:00.540
Is that jokes are like stabbings like that? Whoa, Rowan?

08:00.780 --> 08:06.340
Okay, Rowan if I could just I don't want to feed I'm ready to talk about my B film

08:06.500 --> 08:10.220
No, no, no now we're gonna talk about how you think the job of

08:10.220 --> 08:13.780
of comedy is to hurt offend

08:15.300 --> 08:17.300
Entertain not to like

08:18.300 --> 08:24.660
Better so look at my but look at my body. Uh-huh. It's very small

08:28.140 --> 08:32.700
With comedy, uh-huh. I make her like a big weapon

08:32.700 --> 08:39.620
I mean, I but I don't not at this particular

08:40.180 --> 08:42.860
ten episode long series

08:46.180 --> 08:52.100
Sir if I may even if you believe this bonkers thing about every joke has a victim

08:52.260 --> 08:57.980
Let's just take that beautiful metaphor. So okay, you don't like the punching up punching down thing. That's fine

08:57.980 --> 09:03.500
Why do you want to victimize? Okay in your logic you want a bit you think it's cool and fun

09:04.100 --> 09:05.660
to victimize

09:05.660 --> 09:07.980
Marginalized people that is what you think God

09:09.180 --> 09:12.220
God made me a comedian God made me a weapon

09:14.020 --> 09:21.420
Uh-huh. Look at my little look at my little body. Yeah, it's hard not to look at it now that you've removed the robe

09:21.420 --> 09:25.580
You've contorted it into that big bug I face that you do. Yeah

09:26.540 --> 09:28.540
Yeah, so anyway

09:29.100 --> 09:35.000
So but when Mitch Hedberg said like when you're standing in front of a fire exit during a fire

09:35.660 --> 09:41.980
Right and he makes that whole joke about someone telling him to move because that's a fire exit. Who's the victim in that joke?

09:42.380 --> 09:45.100
Well, it reminds me of a story my best friend

09:45.100 --> 09:52.500
Bill Maher told me when I was having dinner with him and Louis and Louis CK. Oh boy. Okay that

09:54.060 --> 09:58.980
Can we get back to the B thing because I fall down a lot in this movie and it hurts

09:59.260 --> 10:06.420
Every time and I want a little bit of credit for that when you used a credit card to spread butter on toast

10:06.420 --> 10:10.140
Who was the victim there Rowan just out of curiosity?

10:11.140 --> 10:13.580
Who were you really sticking it to there?

10:13.580 --> 10:16.860
That wasn't a joke. That was a story

10:18.620 --> 10:24.700
That really happened that was a story I would did you just do an impression of me to me I

10:25.340 --> 10:32.060
Did do it again David that I'm sorry David hugely. I've actually been rowing this whole time. He's

10:32.620 --> 10:34.620
You do it better than I do

10:35.300 --> 10:37.300
I'm transformative

10:37.420 --> 10:39.420
and seen the art

10:39.420 --> 10:45.580
Must be separated from the artist in this case because it's Griffin

10:45.580 --> 10:48.880
I don't think it needs to be we're all rooting for the fucking B

10:48.880 --> 10:54.860
Oh, I hope the last shot is we find out early on that his character Trevor

10:54.860 --> 11:00.700
So challenging Trevor is allergic to bees and I hope the last shot of episode 10

11:01.660 --> 11:05.940
At minute 100 collectively he gets stabbed in the fucking eyeball

11:05.940 --> 11:11.580
And we see him and like every flash of memory comes back and as he's dying

11:11.580 --> 11:14.060
He's like I was really a piece of shit and then he dies

11:14.700 --> 11:20.540
That's what I'm rooting for. I just think that's he's the likely that I think it's unlikely to happen

11:20.940 --> 11:26.300
The quote you're assuming it's a comedy the quotes that mr. B says in this article

11:27.180 --> 11:29.180
Are truly truly truly outrageous

11:30.100 --> 11:34.540
First of all, he says you've always got to kick up really what?

11:34.540 --> 11:38.540
That's not I don't think anyone says you got a kick a little to cause a stir

11:38.980 --> 11:44.820
What if there's someone extremely smug arrogant aggressive self-satisfied who happens to be below in society?

11:44.820 --> 11:47.260
They're not all in house. Yeah, like trans people

11:48.620 --> 11:52.900
All arrogant they're not all in houses of Parliament or in monarchies

11:53.700 --> 11:55.340
Thanks, really?

11:55.340 --> 11:56.460
anyway

11:56.460 --> 12:02.380
This is not hard. It's not it's not hard then the other people got it's like fucking

12:02.380 --> 12:06.020
Then the other people in that community

12:06.900 --> 12:12.380
That arrogant person at the top in that community is up from them

12:12.900 --> 12:16.140
You don't just have fucking carte blanche

12:16.780 --> 12:18.220
Rowan

12:18.220 --> 12:20.540
They're not above you. Listen, I

12:21.700 --> 12:24.900
Don't have anything to say here, but I just want to say

12:25.660 --> 12:30.660
This is about the most half-assed sort of condemnation of cancel culture that I have ever read

12:30.660 --> 12:35.100
If you could you can hear the trepidation in his quotes of like, um

12:35.980 --> 12:38.420
It does seem to me that uh

12:40.580 --> 12:47.420
Anyway, it's like he got a call from like other old white dude comedians and they're like, hey

12:47.900 --> 12:53.260
Rowan buddy, we notice you getting a lot of press for man versus beat and you are of a certain age

12:53.260 --> 13:01.300
And your skin is white in your hand be gonna need you to make a comment about cancel culture

13:01.820 --> 13:03.820
as is a

13:03.980 --> 13:05.980
requirement it appears for

13:06.260 --> 13:09.520
Everyone who is a straight white?

13:10.100 --> 13:17.340
Cis dude of a certain age. Oh, you got a credit. I will say the credit where credits do

13:17.340 --> 13:22.580
Yeah, you have to be

13:23.340 --> 13:26.900
So deep in the paint on this belief system

13:27.780 --> 13:30.780
like had a newspaper in the last

13:31.460 --> 13:37.220
Five years and just been like I bet I could nail this go be awesome

13:40.020 --> 13:42.020
Put me on coach

13:42.020 --> 13:44.020
I

13:46.380 --> 13:48.380
Anguishing

13:49.460 --> 13:55.020
Thanks, yeah, it's given us it's given us I would say a lot to think about being

13:55.820 --> 14:01.460
That hard to say. Yeah, you're right. I fucked up shouldn't have made that joke. I'll do better

14:01.460 --> 14:03.900
Is that I don't even think I don't even think he said it

14:03.900 --> 14:07.820
I think he's saying other people say he's look around he sees the way the winds blowing

14:07.820 --> 14:13.740
He wonders when is spreading butter on toast with a fucking credit card gonna be problem. I'm attic

14:13.740 --> 14:18.340
I don't know and he doesn't know you don't know that's the sword of Damocles swinging over his head

14:19.940 --> 14:26.540
So let's let's begin the show yeah, it's an advice show as you know, here's some advice

14:27.020 --> 14:29.020
Show your fucking mouth

14:29.420 --> 14:32.680
Travis please everyone's opinion is incredible

14:32.680 --> 14:34.680
Ah

14:36.160 --> 14:39.320
Travis now which way think about the small body

14:39.640 --> 14:46.360
Mm-hmm you punching cuz you're a bigger guy. You're a bigger guy than row. Oh, you're saying physically. Oh, yes. Okay physically

14:46.520 --> 14:48.520
That's what it's meant the whole time. Oh

14:49.000 --> 14:57.280
This is why everybody's always fucking ripping off Tom Hanks. Yes, so tall and so broad. It's why all we have to make our comedy

14:57.280 --> 15:03.400
So weak because of our huge fucking bodies. Yeah, a big ripped muscles

15:03.400 --> 15:07.680
We should stop working out so we could make fun of more people. That's why Tom Hanks is nice to everybody

15:07.680 --> 15:10.400
It's cuz he's so worried. He'll notice there. He's all

15:11.440 --> 15:12.720
Yeah

15:12.720 --> 15:17.040
One V one me Tom one day Tom is gonna get mad, right?

15:17.040 --> 15:22.600
He's gonna rip off his suit that he always wears and underneath this is gonna be huge

15:22.600 --> 15:27.400
glistening fucking muscles and everyone's like we had no idea and he's like

15:27.400 --> 15:33.080
Why'd you think I was so nice not now and then she's gonna punch through everyone's faces

15:33.080 --> 15:35.820
You look at his you look at his eyes. They're the deadest eyes

15:36.360 --> 15:40.960
Jedis eyes because all the life has drained down to his huge fists

15:41.900 --> 15:46.240
Okay, this is my show. Oh real quick. Thanks to everybody who came out to our shows in

16:53.800 --> 16:58.880
I'm not very good, but I enjoy it just for sitting in the Sun laying my mind wander

16:59.400 --> 17:05.680
However, one of my neighbors has seen me doing this several times and every time tells me I should put my art in the local

17:05.680 --> 17:06.660
museum

17:06.660 --> 17:11.400
The thing is she has never actually seen my work and she doesn't seem to be joking

17:11.400 --> 17:15.520
In fact, she's begun asking me if I've sent my work to the gallery yet

17:15.520 --> 17:20.240
And when I say no, she seems annoyed. How do I reclaim the contentment of painting on my porch?

17:20.240 --> 17:23.120
That's from porch Picasso in Hamilton, Ontario

17:24.800 --> 17:28.680
Art is if we've learned anything today subjective

17:29.040 --> 17:33.920
Yeah, and so I bet right the right agent the right

17:33.920 --> 17:40.040
I don't know dealer could sell your painting without anyone ever seeing it, you know what I mean?

17:40.040 --> 17:44.640
And I can tell you exactly how and this is why I think I would be a great art agent

17:45.200 --> 17:49.760
Okay, you hear me you're painting. Maybe it looks good. Maybe it looks like a dog shit

17:50.080 --> 17:53.520
But I take like a literal like I take it to a rich

17:54.120 --> 17:56.240
guy and I say

17:57.140 --> 18:00.840
Check this art out and they say oh, that's interesting. I say yes

18:02.280 --> 18:06.360
$50,000 and they say why I say well the elephant did paint it with his trunk. Oh

18:06.360 --> 18:08.360
I

18:08.840 --> 18:12.600
Love to meet the artist. It's a you can't he's too big

18:13.400 --> 18:17.900
He's so good. You it's hard to get in places. I'll go to him

18:18.420 --> 18:22.000
He's very territorial. His tusks are so sharp

18:23.320 --> 18:28.760
but look at this and it's like it transcends the the

18:29.640 --> 18:34.720
Elephant experience. Oh, yeah, it's really great. I'm just kind of into penguin art right now

18:34.720 --> 18:39.600
Oh, well, let me see if I have any penguin art. Oh, here's one right here. It looks very same

18:39.600 --> 18:46.760
It looks similar. I know but a penguin did this one. He's friends with the elephant. No way. Yeah, he did plagiarize

18:47.240 --> 18:53.080
I'll tell you what. I'd love is if you could get a collab going between the two of them. Oh, here's that

18:54.480 --> 18:57.160
Yeah, I'll take it. How much did you say?

18:57.200 --> 19:02.200
Well, this one's a hundred thousand cuz it was the collab between the pink penguin and the elephant. And so I

19:02.200 --> 19:07.820
Have to pay them independently. Can I trade you this painting that was done by a tiger?

19:08.280 --> 19:12.340
What if the painting is of the neighbor? Oh, wow

19:12.880 --> 19:16.600
wait, they're like, did you send it in yet and you're like I

19:18.120 --> 19:20.120
Have not even begun

19:20.480 --> 19:22.280
to capture

19:22.280 --> 19:28.260
Tenth of a million of the light in my subjects eyes and then you spin it around and it's them

19:28.260 --> 19:33.380
Yeah, and they're holding hands with the Joker. Yeah, and they're in it

19:34.380 --> 19:40.700
Which Joker which Joker what which Joe come on the funniest Joker the only Joker I would say by the way

19:40.700 --> 19:44.900
That's ever been funny the walkie-feet. Oh, you don't think the only funny Joker

19:46.300 --> 19:48.300
Out of time and out of universe

19:50.660 --> 19:52.140
So transgressive

19:52.140 --> 19:58.860
Hey, is there anything funnier than the fact that everybody was clowning so hard at Morbius that Sony was like they love it

19:58.860 --> 20:02.460
Let's put Morbius back in theaters and they had Lido up there on

20:02.980 --> 20:08.900
Tick-tock like it's morbid time. Go see Morbius in theaters, baby. It's so funny, right? And then nobody went

20:11.340 --> 20:13.420
What happened as I understand that

20:15.060 --> 20:20.040
Morbid time was a viral joke and Jared Leto saw it was like

20:20.040 --> 20:25.960
Yeah, and announced we're making Morbius too. And then Sony had to be like, uh, there are no plans to make Morbius, too

20:26.320 --> 20:31.120
That's so Morbius. That's so Morbius. Did we do a Morbius watch?

20:31.120 --> 20:35.160
I think we did do a Morbius. We were ahead of the curve on that one. Okay good

20:36.320 --> 20:40.360
You need to show them the art and you will be able to

20:41.160 --> 20:43.160
micro expression

20:43.160 --> 20:49.960
judge whether or not they still believe it belongs in a museum or not and it's gonna be tough cuz they're gonna say like

20:49.960 --> 20:51.960
Oh, yeah, that is

20:52.640 --> 20:58.960
But that is perfection. That is poignant, but they're gonna make a face when they first see it like go to him

20:58.960 --> 21:03.760
Oh damn, that can't go in a museum. Oh damn and you you will know from that

21:03.840 --> 21:07.960
I think the next time they ask if it's in gallery just say yes

21:09.160 --> 21:11.160
Just say yes

21:11.160 --> 21:13.160
They'll be happy

21:13.320 --> 21:18.920
The next time you see the next time you look in their window and see them cooking in the kitchen start pounding on their door

21:18.920 --> 21:23.100
And they run to answer it be like just send that pie to the pie

21:23.320 --> 21:30.920
Contest just so like they know what it's like when every single thing you do has to be adjudicated on the very highest level possible

21:31.680 --> 21:33.680
in this case a pie contest

21:35.640 --> 21:38.200
Or did you submit your painting to a pie contest

21:38.200 --> 21:42.000
What why aren't there pie painting eating guns?

21:42.920 --> 21:44.920
Thank you. I

21:47.360 --> 21:54.600
Would love to watch I love watching YouTube art restoration videos, but they would be triple improved after sort of

21:55.640 --> 22:02.860
dehydrating the work and repairing the the framework for the canvas and retacking it and you know doing a

22:02.860 --> 22:09.100
you know very conservative touch-ups here and there and then they got out a big yummy plate and a knife and fork and they

22:09.100 --> 22:12.560
Tucked in a bit and just went to town on it and got pretty sick

22:12.560 --> 22:18.240
I'm guessing or what if it was like, what's it called? You guys are both video game nerds when it's like an unbalanced

22:19.040 --> 22:23.480
Like PvP was that called when it's like one versus four something

22:24.400 --> 22:29.280
Asymmetrical where one person is trying to restore the painting while someone else is trying to eat it

22:29.280 --> 22:34.360
I see and it's like a race to see how much of it can get eaten before it's finished

22:35.360 --> 22:40.200
How well you can restore it? That's getting eaten. That sounds good to me

22:40.200 --> 22:46.400
I would watch the fuck out of that and also the floor is lava. Can we approach the wizard? Yeah. Yeah, let's go

22:46.600 --> 22:52.200
Supplicate yourselves haters as we learn all about this one some a lot of people sent this in. Thank you

22:52.200 --> 22:54.520
It's it is it's how to be a bro

22:55.600 --> 22:57.980
I've done that. I have a I have siblings

22:57.980 --> 23:02.520
This is different. Oh, they mean it in like the okay

23:03.260 --> 23:05.260
You know Barney

23:05.700 --> 23:07.500
Simpson oh

23:07.500 --> 23:09.500
Is that not like the dinosaur? Yeah

23:09.540 --> 23:15.340
Yeah Barney Samson Barney Brom Samson from how I did meet your mom

23:15.340 --> 23:21.460
And so we are gonna start here with method one being a good bro live by a bro code every bros gotta have a code

23:21.660 --> 23:25.220
It's the thing that unites and binds and solidifies the concept of the bro

23:25.220 --> 23:28.300
Separating bro from the common beasts and squirrels of the world

23:28.740 --> 23:35.060
You're broke your bro is and squirrels you say your bro code is up to you and your bros as well as the punishments for

23:35.260 --> 23:40.780
Transgressing but a few rules are generally universal when it comes to bros never mess with your bros date sister or mother

23:41.140 --> 23:44.400
Always have a bros back always take wingman responsibilities

23:44.400 --> 23:48.180
Seriously bros won't make other bros look bad in front of girls bros

23:48.180 --> 23:54.820
Don't let bros drive drunk that one. I don't think is typically in there, but it's the best one

23:54.820 --> 24:01.940
It's awesome, right? It's a good. It's there should be more like that like bros help bros make smart fiscal investments

24:01.980 --> 24:05.060
Yeah, right bros let other bros know when they should be

24:05.700 --> 24:09.220
Don't let other bros lease because you're honestly just throwing your money

24:09.220 --> 24:14.980
Yeah, bros help other bros remember to start preparing their taxes in like February and don't wait to the last minute

24:15.340 --> 24:20.420
Find your neighbors and build up a brom unity bros. Fuck. I need to pay my taxes bros

24:20.420 --> 24:22.420
Oh

24:23.500 --> 24:26.020
Dereliction of bro duties on that we got to watch out

24:27.500 --> 24:29.500
His fiduciary

24:30.580 --> 24:32.580
I'm like, I love fiduciary

24:36.260 --> 24:41.520
Dish airy more like I love nothing more than the concept of like going door-to-door in your neighborhood and be like, hey

24:41.700 --> 24:46.920
How's it going? I'm looking to put together a close-knit group of bros

24:46.920 --> 24:54.440
Um, is that something you or anyone in this house would be interested in? It's Grecian if that helps

24:54.440 --> 25:01.880
It's like Greece bros. Yeah, like from Greece times not like rose. We're not bromans. Okay, not bromans

25:01.880 --> 25:05.300
We're just bro-ing out with other in a Grecian fashion right now

25:05.300 --> 25:12.580
You're here. It's just right now. It's just me and Zach and we hang out in a little chamber. We call the bar Fittoria. So

25:12.580 --> 25:16.940
uh surround yourself with other brosephs bras and bros yeas

25:17.820 --> 25:21.060
Bros say bro say rosiers rosiers

25:23.380 --> 25:27.500
Yeah, I'll wear it it's just to give me a little shape up there it's a broseur learn

25:28.420 --> 25:34.260
Bros, don't body-shame other bros, bro. Yeah, that's true. It's a broseur. I love it man. You look good

25:34.260 --> 25:39.320
I love your confidence. I love how it makes you feel learn the proper bro shake when two bros meet

25:39.320 --> 25:43.280
They don't shake hands like a couple of preachers and they certainly don't hug

25:43.940 --> 25:45.460
What?

25:45.460 --> 25:52.660
Bros don't hug guys or give each other preacher shakes. They bro-shake. They just gently touch-dance. It's a combination hug

25:53.100 --> 25:55.940
They just give a feather soft kiss on the lips

25:57.180 --> 25:59.300
Just butterflake it but broderflake

26:00.660 --> 26:02.660
butterfly kisses butterfly kisses

26:03.900 --> 26:06.180
Kisses my bro gets here

26:06.180 --> 26:12.420
Gonna drink a hundred thousand cases of beer they

26:14.220 --> 26:16.460
Feelings but we will never hug

26:17.660 --> 26:23.040
Then he tries to drive home, but I won't let him cuz he's drunk they bro shake

26:23.040 --> 26:27.140
It's like a combination hug high-five and arm wrestling match. In other words perfect for bros

26:27.140 --> 26:31.540
They love and then you share a bro to visualize that is that the thing where they're like, bro

26:31.540 --> 26:38.040
And then they're two hands like clasping arm wrestling fashion and they just swing it back and forth like big bodies together

26:38.760 --> 26:42.900
Yeah, and touch this. I just don't understand. Why can't bros hug?

26:42.900 --> 26:49.100
That's so weird. They hug in like they hug in band of brother. Well, you can hug Jocelyn

26:49.100 --> 26:53.180
Sorry, you can hug you got to do handshake into hug pat pat break

26:53.900 --> 26:56.260
Handshake into hug pat pat break. That's for bros

26:56.260 --> 27:01.700
That's the Christians. I mean you got the Christian side hug and you can do a Christian side hug

27:01.700 --> 27:07.300
But no hugs before bro marriage. It actually says the next step says abandon your faith in Christ only

27:08.820 --> 27:12.580
But do keep your grades up keep your grades up it says

27:12.980 --> 27:19.420
Bros help other rose cram for tests. I'm gonna skip around here. Say what you mean the world is yeah

27:19.420 --> 27:26.820
Too many complicated things conversing with your bros shouldn't be one of them. You should have open bro-munication. Um

27:26.820 --> 27:31.500
If you're pissed that your bro borrowed your car and didn't fill it up say dude next time fill it up

27:33.020 --> 27:36.180
Word if you're upset that your bro

27:36.660 --> 27:43.060
Borrowed your copy of Iron Giant and didn't rewind it before giving it back because you still believe in VHS

27:43.060 --> 27:45.060
That's another thing about bros fucking love

27:45.060 --> 27:49.460
It is yeah, they take DVDs hate they hate digital media

27:49.460 --> 27:54.860
They like to have a collection a brolection if you will that they can show other bros. That's very important

27:55.700 --> 27:59.540
Always be rallying just like Joe Montana in the Super Bowl

27:59.540 --> 28:05.020
I don't under and ready at the Indy 500 he drives or Michael Jordan in the playoffs

28:05.020 --> 28:10.980
I know that one good bros can't stop and won't stop whether you're partying working out or plugging through another round of Madden on

28:10.980 --> 28:14.800
Xbox because bros she's not Sony phonies

28:15.540 --> 28:23.180
But that's a shame. That's a shame because brony is well, that's a different thing. Isn't it? It's a different thing now Griffin

28:23.180 --> 28:31.420
It's possible that I'm now starting to suspect reading between the lines here that this article is written by someone a lot like us

28:32.060 --> 28:34.060
Because all of their sports

28:34.060 --> 28:41.580
Memories and references are at least 20 years old. There's no way that the person who wrote. This is an actual bro. He's in

28:41.580 --> 28:43.100
There's no way at all

28:43.100 --> 28:47.500
You reference Joe Montana in the Super Bowl. Yeah, like it's big

28:47.500 --> 28:51.120
It's so much better fine bro inspirations the image for this one is pretty good

28:51.120 --> 28:56.460
It's just two boys looking at a big blow-up of a cover of men's journal featuring Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps

28:56.740 --> 28:58.340
This is awesome for me

28:58.340 --> 29:03.260
Every bro should have some famous bros look up to swipe lingo from and in general idolizes the pinnacles of brodom

29:03.260 --> 29:06.940
Some classics of bros include Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps

29:07.460 --> 29:09.460
Guys one time I got kicked in the brodom

29:12.260 --> 29:16.460
Tim Tebow Johnny man's yell Derek Jeter and Chad Johnson

29:17.100 --> 29:22.700
On new line Will Smith Channing Tatum Matthew McConaughey, do they hang?

29:22.740 --> 29:27.220
I don't gotta gotta hang now I could see

29:27.900 --> 29:32.140
McConaughey and Tatum because they were in the dancing movies together. I

29:32.140 --> 29:38.060
Could see that one. They're making the Danzig movie together making the Danzig movie

29:38.060 --> 29:45.060
I'm making the Danzig movie together, of course, and I believe I believe Tatum is running as McConaughey's a vice

29:45.860 --> 29:47.700
Governor. Yeah

29:47.700 --> 29:49.700
assistant governor

29:50.500 --> 29:51.500
Broven or excuse me

29:51.500 --> 29:57.620
The next one is the bros from epic mealtime and then finally just to wrap it all up and I would love to be a fly

29:57.620 --> 30:04.580
In this fucking wall of the room that these boys are in Dane Cook Jim Belushi and Joe Rogan. What's that?

30:04.580 --> 30:06.020
Hang out. What is it?

30:06.020 --> 30:08.740
I'm gonna open the door. What's that smell?

30:11.100 --> 30:17.780
What is the smell in this room Dane Jim and Joe what have you all been doing in here Dane Jim and Joe

30:18.180 --> 30:20.580
Who are your guys like bro idols?

30:20.580 --> 30:25.580
Who do you look up to when you're like you're hanging out with your bros and you're like, this is who I want to be

30:25.580 --> 30:27.580
like oh, man

30:27.980 --> 30:30.620
Fucking Malcolm Gladwell. Yeah. Hell yeah

30:31.860 --> 30:33.620
fucking

30:33.620 --> 30:40.420
Jimmy Carter those two bros. They love hanging out and love to hang out fucking David Copperfield

30:42.420 --> 30:44.420
Fucking

30:45.180 --> 30:51.300
Homer Simpson, yeah, bro. Mr. Simpson fucking Jesus Christ and Bronin O'Brien

30:51.300 --> 30:56.980
So that's that part and try to make it guys try to make every day epic

30:56.980 --> 31:01.380
A bros just like a regular dude except more exciting

31:01.380 --> 31:07.380
You got to be in constant search that next epic moment tweaking every situation to make it just a little more perfect

31:08.380 --> 31:14.900
Now I will say I have been in many a bar and location where bros have come in and there is I don't know that the word

31:14.900 --> 31:19.340
I would use is excitement, but there is a definite. Oh no kind of feeling

31:19.340 --> 31:25.220
There's a what's about to happen now kind of feeling. Is that excitement? Is that or is it fight-or-flight?

31:25.220 --> 31:28.940
Well, let me give you some great examples here Travis and these are just normal things

31:28.940 --> 31:32.740
I would suggest everybody does don't go out to dinner with your bros

31:32.740 --> 31:39.220
But make epic eating occasions seek out 72 ounce steak eating challenges or spicy food eating challenges to make it competitive

31:39.220 --> 31:44.500
Never let the loser live it down bro. Wait, did you start off with don't go out to eat with your bros?

31:44.500 --> 31:50.260
Don't go out to dinner with your bros, but make epic eating occasions. Don't know wait. No, what let me go

31:50.260 --> 31:52.260
Don't go to class

31:52.260 --> 31:55.140
Don't keep this is specific. This is whoa

31:55.140 --> 31:56.140
unprecedented

31:56.140 --> 32:01.740
Don't keep your grades up. Don't go to class seek out epic new ways of integrating information. You're misreading it

32:01.740 --> 32:03.740
No, just this is what it says

32:04.300 --> 32:10.500
Research and yeah, you've been handed a knockoff wiki how article. This cannot be this is from sticky

32:10.500 --> 32:16.340
How get out of here? Hey, I just want to jump back real quick when they say don't go out to dinner with your bros

32:16.340 --> 32:21.780
But do you like plan like 72 is it like there's a 72 ounce steak eating challenge

32:21.780 --> 32:25.740
I would love to do that with you sometime, but we can't make plans to do it

32:25.740 --> 32:28.260
But if we both end up there, it's cool

32:29.260 --> 32:36.260
Don't go to class seek out epic new ways of integrating information research optimum workout routines to maximize your learning retention and record

32:36.260 --> 32:41.460
Routines to maximize your learning retention and record lectures on your iPod while you multitask in the lecture hall what?

32:42.180 --> 32:44.060
Work out in the lecture hall

32:44.060 --> 32:49.660
Make your presence in class epic by answering questions arguing with the prof and making your presence known

32:49.860 --> 32:54.220
Hey prof now this this seems like this is now

32:54.940 --> 32:57.900
Headed towards how to be like a totally ripped

32:58.620 --> 33:02.220
Like figure in a God's not dead movie. Yes

33:02.220 --> 33:07.060
Yes, but if God's not dead, how do you explain these gains? Yeah

33:09.660 --> 33:14.540
I've been worshiping at the iron temple and the Southern Baptist Church down the street

33:14.620 --> 33:21.760
Do we have the fortitude as an organization to release a t-shirt which reads?

33:23.140 --> 33:26.380
God's not dead. How do you explain these?

33:26.380 --> 33:32.580
Gains, I'm also realizing that the knot in their face. They're wildly confused

33:38.420 --> 33:44.740
Now it makes it seem like these games are crime against God so God's not dead if God was dead

33:44.740 --> 33:46.740
The only way I could have these gains is

33:51.060 --> 33:53.060
Living God

33:53.060 --> 33:57.820
I acquiesced to a challenge of his power. He wouldn't stop to this

33:58.940 --> 34:02.740
See these fucking gates my eyes on the throne

34:04.060 --> 34:06.060
God is dead. I killed

34:06.820 --> 34:13.640
I punched up way way up. I got him guys. I pushed up so hard. I got him

34:16.340 --> 34:18.260
Got him

34:18.260 --> 34:23.060
Not you know what whenever I say that and we don't actually make the shirt. Someone else makes the shirt

34:23.060 --> 34:25.740
Well have to make it I don't think we can make that shirt

34:25.740 --> 34:31.900
That's my best if we let that one I'm gonna just tell McKay to start working on it right now. Don't McKay, please don't

34:32.620 --> 34:39.280
There's a lot of fashion ones of how you can be like a athletic gear bro or a gentleman, bro

34:39.540 --> 34:43.340
My favorite is my favorites the motocross gentleman

34:43.340 --> 34:48.980
Bro always leaves his calling card of the scene of the crime try out the motocross bro

34:49.340 --> 34:54.100
Gearhead metal listening SoCal bros have their own style and vibe all together

34:54.100 --> 34:57.860
You can see these sorts of bros at the vans warped to tour or at the skate park

34:58.700 --> 35:04.620
Typically, they'll be decked out in the following entire long dickies shorts skate shoes like vans or air walk flat brim hats black socks

35:04.620 --> 35:10.860
Pulled all the way up. This is more about their long dickies Griffin. It sounds like ska bro more than anything, which is

35:10.860 --> 35:14.820
Love that here and then the last part is like

35:15.540 --> 35:20.580
We want you to this is to keep your grades up of it and it's called avoiding stereotypes

35:20.580 --> 35:26.840
It includes tips such as drink responsibly treat women respectfully eat a well-balanced diet and drive responsibly. I

35:27.420 --> 35:31.100
Mean, yeah, okay fine, but that just seems like human

35:32.380 --> 35:38.540
Responsibility they didn't start the article with this section for a reason because they wanted you to have like a lot of fun

35:38.540 --> 35:45.380
And like think about all the epic times. Yeah. Yeah eating a big steak and then the spiciest food ever to give you

35:46.020 --> 35:47.900
some sort of new

35:47.900 --> 35:49.720
scientifically advanced

35:49.720 --> 35:51.020
macho Rhea

35:51.020 --> 35:54.740
That would be something that we could write about in medical journals

35:55.860 --> 36:01.100
This is all bros always carry Toms for their bros with with soft tummies

36:01.100 --> 36:05.980
I want to circle back to try to make everyday epic because there's a bit I didn't read which is don't go on dates

36:05.980 --> 36:09.580
Go on adventures dinner in a movie. That's for regular dudes

36:09.700 --> 36:16.940
Take the cutie from econ whitewater rafting or ask the hot barista at your favorite coffee shop to go to a metal concert tonight

36:17.580 --> 36:21.240
Take your semi-serious date to the racquetball court and see what you're made of

36:23.500 --> 36:28.860
Hey never ask anyone out and tell them that it's a semi-serious date they will wait

36:29.100 --> 36:35.180
Don't get weird. Don't get weird. You can't tell them. It's a semi-charmed kind of date. That's a different thing 15 love

36:35.180 --> 36:41.500
I love you. What what they lift up this head. You see me pick up a heavy thing. I do

36:42.420 --> 36:44.420
Let's see that big guy over there. I'm gonna pick him up

36:45.300 --> 36:47.300
I'll pick up this bench

36:49.220 --> 36:52.660

Pinnacle human Ryan Lochte then this is your chance to do that

37:10.820 --> 37:16.060
If you want to kick it in a room with Dane Cook Jim Belushi and Joe Rogan, and what are they talking about?

37:16.180 --> 37:17.940
They're talking about

37:17.940 --> 37:19.820
woke culture

37:19.820 --> 37:22.260
Probably. Yeah, I mean, let's be honest

37:22.820 --> 37:29.320
Fucking it's it's Jim Belushi. Here's what the conversation is. Jim Belushi is like, hey guys have I been canceled?

37:29.320 --> 37:34.900
I feel like I should have been by now. It's I've got that vibe. But like I don't know if I actually have been or not

37:35.420 --> 37:37.420
help

37:37.980 --> 37:43.340
Which okay wait, hold on so I just want to talk about Joe Rogan Jim Belushi and Jane cook for a second

37:43.340 --> 37:48.940
Who do you think no? No, I have to know who is the connecting person mayor, right?

37:48.940 --> 37:54.260
Who was a friend that they all know right? You can't tell me they all know each other equally, right?

37:54.260 --> 37:59.860
Is it Dane Cook and her friend Dane Cook is friends with both of them or is it Joe Rogan?

37:59.860 --> 38:04.860
That's friends with both of it's got to be that right. They were all actually, you know, it was they were all in that

38:05.500 --> 38:11.800
12 angry men remake. Oh, right, right, right. Well angry, bro. It's 12 furious bros. Yeah

38:12.300 --> 38:14.900
Yeah, God Jim Belushi was so fucking funny in that movie

38:14.900 --> 38:19.700
Do you remember we stabbed that is like there's no chance anyone else would have that knife and then you stab the knife down

38:19.700 --> 38:25.300
But it you you know, it went in into Dane Cook's hand and he was like, oh shit

38:25.820 --> 38:30.460
Fucking challenging challenging stuff. You know what? I think it's the most challenging

38:31.140 --> 38:36.700
Comedy when you say the same shit people have been saying for the last 20 years fucking challenging

38:36.700 --> 38:41.540
It's hard when you do that because it's like you have to say it and like it you have to say it in like a silly

38:41.540 --> 38:42.220
voice

38:42.220 --> 38:46.940
Right hard to cut it's really hard to come up with those and also we should be careful about

38:46.940 --> 38:49.940
Criticizing people for making the same jokes over and over again

38:50.540 --> 38:54.780
We've been doing this show for about 50 years. Yeah, but we make the same stupid

38:57.180 --> 39:01.220
Let's go to making mean Joe or we try to now the only people are mean to is

39:01.660 --> 39:07.020
Old straight. Well, every joke has a victim Travis. Yeah, I guess that's true

39:07.020 --> 39:16.100
You know now that you say it Griffin, I think it's time to go to the money zone. Yeah

39:20.780 --> 39:25.100
Griffin you got any big summer plans? You gonna travel to like Italy or France?

39:25.620 --> 39:28.780
Yeah, I was thinking about doing a sort of Italy France

39:29.820 --> 39:31.020
Germany

39:31.020 --> 39:38.660
Spain those the whole circuit just getting the big four the big four as we call them. Well, it's probably a little too late now

39:39.380 --> 39:46.060
But you should start working on babble to learn all four of those languages in time for your summer trip

39:46.060 --> 39:52.260
Oh, I know all of the languages to the countries you do. Did you use babble to do it? I did

39:52.260 --> 39:56.340
Yeah, I learned Italian and I learned all of them. Yeah

39:56.340 --> 40:01.540
Yeah, well, it actually makes a lot of sense because it only takes ten minutes to complete a lesson

40:07.420 --> 40:13.100

40:21.140 --> 40:25.340
All in one room. It was tower of babble up in and that's how they got the name

Whip them up a question right now. You make this so hard loving me

44:35.020 --> 44:36.940
I

44:36.940 --> 44:41.740
Like the show general where we at are you the victim wait the whole time is Justin

44:42.380 --> 44:45.900
That actually makes perfect sense. Hey brothers, so I met this

44:46.780 --> 44:47.820
girl

44:47.820 --> 44:51.100
That I think is pretty cool. All right, and well, yeah

44:53.100 --> 44:59.260
Yeah, bro, yeah, yeah pretty cool, huh, but yeah, I get it what's her sense of humor like me she's rich

44:59.260 --> 45:04.620
Yeah, we're talking to her one day. You heard me when I showed her this cute frog picture. I saw from instagram

45:05.020 --> 45:07.020
Now I love frogs like every other guy

45:07.340 --> 45:11.740
But now what that's the weirdest sexism I've ever heard in my entire life

45:13.340 --> 45:20.700
Like every other guy like every dude I love frogs now whenever I talk to her she only ever sends posts of frogs

45:21.180 --> 45:23.180
I'm not like super obsessed with frogs

45:23.740 --> 45:28.140
So how'd I get out of this frog purgatory so I can move on from this frog talk?

45:28.140 --> 45:31.980
Thanks brothers, and that's from frog friend frenzy

45:33.020 --> 45:35.020
Uh, you can start throwing some toads in there

45:35.580 --> 45:42.240
Oh, yeah, and then oh and then like a salamander. Yeah, walk it out to other sort of amphibians

45:43.260 --> 45:45.260
It's a salamander amphibian

45:45.580 --> 45:51.980
Uh, I think uh, wait, what's the one that has like a philly neck from he's a straight up phibian. Yeah

45:51.980 --> 45:58.060
Yeah, yeah axolotl. I think is another one that's amphib. Yeah, that's a that's a fibby. They love water

45:59.500 --> 46:01.500
Juice you got any fun frog?

46:01.980 --> 46:04.540
I don't know. You don't have any frog facts, but I do want to say

46:05.020 --> 46:10.140
The problem is you got to open up a bit. Yeah, this is the only thing this person knows about there

46:10.220 --> 46:15.420
It is it's your frog thing. You got to let him know some other things about you that you care more about

46:17.900 --> 46:20.860
It seems like she's invested in you in one way or another

46:20.860 --> 46:25.820
Right, she likes talking to you. She was like this person likes frogs. I'm going to show them frogs

46:26.360 --> 46:29.820
Everybody's got like everybody's had that experience if you have a new

46:30.540 --> 46:33.900
uh a new relationship you're trying to foment and

46:34.620 --> 46:38.380
you're you're the fertilizer that you've chosen for it is like

46:38.940 --> 46:45.820
The one you just find one little bit of common ground, you know, this is actually that's oh you you have also seen

46:46.460 --> 46:48.380
like

46:48.380 --> 46:49.500
You know

46:49.500 --> 46:54.940
All of oz and you're like that you I have to make that my entire life right now for the rest of this

46:55.080 --> 46:59.420
Conversation like all I care about is oz or else i'm not getting out of this conversation alive

46:59.900 --> 47:02.380
Like that kind of vibe and you've just done that with frog

47:02.620 --> 47:08.860
It's so fun the way that you see human interactions. Justin. It's so great. Really. How do you mean trap go on?

47:09.100 --> 47:13.980
The idea of getting out of a conversation alive. It's just it's wonderful

47:14.700 --> 47:17.040
Have you ever died juice you ever died from a conversation?

47:17.040 --> 47:20.180
No, because i'm a fucking professional

47:21.760 --> 47:26.400
Because he's constantly got his head on a swivel exactly because I because I keep my shit

47:26.880 --> 47:29.920
I keep my fucking powder dry and my shit tight

47:32.320 --> 47:35.440
He's got one finger over the eject button at all times

47:35.520 --> 47:40.960
I don't go into a conversation without an x-file plan, right? Like of course, it's fine

47:40.960 --> 47:49.600
I had a coverage we had there was a very nice gentleman that we met at the casino as we were or

47:49.680 --> 47:52.640
Sorry, I guess it's a resort, you know after the show we have

47:53.440 --> 47:55.200
there's a guy who's like

47:55.200 --> 47:59.760
The the weirdest thing about the show is that it's in a self-contained location. So there's signs of us

48:00.320 --> 48:05.120
Like pictures of us big ones while you're eating lunch or like going to the store

48:05.120 --> 48:10.560
Or up there using that they put up one of me in the bathroom their posters like our posters

48:11.040 --> 48:14.240
And this fella behind us in line to get coffee is like hey

48:15.120 --> 48:16.880
You guys are the brothers

48:16.880 --> 48:22.240
And we're like, yeah, that's us. He's like I didn't go to this show, but I thought about it. I was like, okay

48:22.720 --> 48:25.200
What kind of show is it? We're like, that's kind of a bad advice show

48:25.760 --> 48:29.280
And he was like, oh, okay, and and then like three minutes pass

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
and he came back to us and he was like

48:32.000 --> 48:35.040
I'm, sorry. Can you just give me an example of the kind of question?

48:36.240 --> 48:39.040
Yeah, oh my heart is racing right now, I know right

48:39.680 --> 48:41.360
travis

48:41.360 --> 48:42.800
stepped in

48:42.800 --> 48:48.480
And travis does not have my sort of like hang up so he's able to just actually talk to people

48:48.960 --> 48:54.960
But he that he goes in a little hot sometimes and he said well like last night we had one

48:55.520 --> 48:57.120
where a

48:57.120 --> 48:59.760
Person's partner was drinking too much milk. Uh-huh

49:00.480 --> 49:01.920
and he's like

49:01.920 --> 49:03.280
Okay

49:03.280 --> 49:04.240
Oh see justin

49:04.240 --> 49:07.040
Let me tell you what I was thinking in that moment when that was my answer

49:07.600 --> 49:10.480
This person wants an excuse to not listen to our show

49:11.200 --> 49:13.200
right, like

49:14.240 --> 49:17.920
We are all all of us looking for excuses to not listen to a podcast

49:18.080 --> 49:21.920
Right the name of the show is literally plastered all over the place, right? Yeah

49:22.160 --> 49:24.960
So he wanted to be like do I care enough about it?

49:24.960 --> 49:28.880
So I was like i'm gonna give you the lowest bar I can think of

49:28.880 --> 49:33.120
We had a question about milk and if you're like, I know okay

49:33.120 --> 49:36.800
That was all I needed to to bump me off of it. You're welcome

49:37.120 --> 49:40.880
Also, I was very sleepy and I didn't want to talk anymore

49:41.280 --> 49:48.240
So I thought someone asked us about milk was a good like we can all agree. Well, that's well, that sounds terrible

49:48.400 --> 49:50.400
Yeah, yeah

49:51.200 --> 49:53.200

You should seek help and don't bite your wallet

54:04.160 --> 54:05.360
No

54:05.360 --> 54:09.120
Here's jamie. I mean unless unless you're like setting a bone

54:09.680 --> 54:14.240
In like a wilderness scenario and you need to bite down on something

54:14.240 --> 54:15.920
Bite down on something

54:15.920 --> 54:19.680
Then like you've dislocated a shoulder while running away from like the predator

Bite down on your wallet so you don't like swallow your tongue. I could see that

54:23.920 --> 54:29.840
Jamie richardson vice president white castle seems to have conflated the restaurant with some sort of eldritch text

54:30.160 --> 54:31.920

54:31.920 --> 54:39.440

55:01.040 --> 55:04.480
Where they made chicken rings, but they were expensive

55:06.640 --> 55:08.640
Hey, it's me jamie from white castle

55:08.640 --> 55:13.440
Um, so these chicken rings each ring individual ring does cost 20

55:13.920 --> 55:21.840
But the reason is we realized it was easier to simply genetically modified chickens to grow in kind of a slinky shape tubular

55:23.600 --> 55:27.200
And that science cost a lot guys, um

55:27.920 --> 55:30.640
And you know and nowhere do we stop to think if we should

55:31.200 --> 55:36.640
Um, and that one's on us, uh, but you're gonna love these hollow chicken flavor. It's fun

55:36.640 --> 55:39.680
