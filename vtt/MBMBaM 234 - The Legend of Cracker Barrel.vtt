00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.320
Hello, everybody, and welcome to a very special My Brother, My Brother and Me

00:48.320 --> 00:52.160
Funeral for a Friend, Saying Goodbye to the Hobbit 2015.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.720
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.800
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:56.800 --> 01:01.760
And I'm your youngest brother, Tom Bombadil.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.720
Griffin, are you sad that you'll have to let Tom Bombadil go?

01:04.720 --> 01:08.720
Tom Bombadil lives in my heart now, so he doesn't have to go anywhere

01:08.720 --> 01:10.960
except for when he stops that heart right up,

01:10.960 --> 01:13.520
and I have to go to the doctor to get the Bombadil out of me.

01:13.520 --> 01:16.880
We've been watching Lord of the Rings movies for 17 years now,

01:16.880 --> 01:20.720
and now we're saying goodbye to the whole franchise.

01:20.720 --> 01:24.560
By 17 years, you mean that we watched all six of them back to back,

01:24.560 --> 01:27.280
and there goes a quarter of our lives. Approximately 17 years.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.800
We're going to say goodbye to the character of Peter Jackson.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.320
Goodbye, Peter Jackson. What are you going to do?

01:32.320 --> 01:33.280
Invention.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.720
He was a motion capture by Andy Serkis.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.760
There's a little Andy Serkis in there, and you just can't see him

01:39.760 --> 01:41.440
because he's surrounded by CGI.

01:41.440 --> 01:45.360
I wanted to say Tony Serkis, but I don't know who Tony Serkis is.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.160
I want to take a brief pause from the funeral for a friend,

01:48.880 --> 01:50.480
saying goodbye to the Hobbit 2015.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.080
I'm a little over the Andy Serkis thing.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.440
I get that he's got a stretchy face. I'm into that.

01:57.440 --> 02:01.360
But this guy has played this range of roles

02:01.360 --> 02:04.400
that makes you think that maybe, just maybe, people are just lazy.

02:05.040 --> 02:05.920
We need a monkey.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.440
Andy Serkis.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.400
Andy Serkis.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.760
We need a little lizard man who loves rings.

02:11.760 --> 02:12.800
Andy Serkis.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.840
We need Ben Affleck.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.040
Oh no, we double booked him.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.320
Get over here, Serkis.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.600
Get the side of your dick out. You're going to be in Gone Girl.

02:19.600 --> 02:24.960
You're going to play the side of Ben Affleck's dick in Gone Girl.

02:24.960 --> 02:25.840
King Kong.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.040
Andy Serkis.

02:27.040 --> 02:27.840
Get Andy Serkis.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.960
Maybe he just is the only actor in Hollywood

02:30.960 --> 02:32.960
that doesn't mind having shit stuck to his face.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.240
Maybe.

02:34.240 --> 02:38.720
Do you think that dude is like, can my face be in this one?

02:38.720 --> 02:40.880
And they're like, sorry, but no.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.560
We can CGI the shit out of it.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.880
We're going to put Armie Hammer's face on your face.

02:44.880 --> 02:49.680
Can you please put my face on the side of Ben Affleck's dick?

02:49.680 --> 02:52.640
And I'll be like, Gone Girl.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.600
I only just met her or something like that.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.400
Can you write some incident, you know, it all ad lib.

02:58.400 --> 02:59.200
It's fine.

02:59.200 --> 03:03.920
So anyway, we're saying goodbye to the Lord of the Rings franchise today.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.680
We got a lot of great guests lined up now.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.600
I know what you're saying.

03:07.600 --> 03:11.120
The Lord of the Rings franchise did technically wrap up December 17th last year.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.240
But there's not a lot going on.

03:14.240 --> 03:19.360
To be fair, critics, I would say that it wraps up when it leaves theaters, which is today.

03:20.080 --> 03:24.000
Today, they just revoked all of the, if you didn't see it by now.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.760
Get the fuck out of here, Hobbits.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.360
You're done.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.320
Just with a broom and it's like, hey, hey, hey, get out.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.920
Your movies are too long and they cost the same as other movies.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.360
We need shorter movies in here.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.400
We need Taken 3.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.080
It's a brisk 86 minutes.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.840
I bet it is because there can't be much movie left there to make, right?

03:43.840 --> 03:45.040
I didn't see Taken 2.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.080
How'd they get her again?

03:46.640 --> 03:48.720
I think he should keep a close eye on people.

03:48.720 --> 03:53.280
She ate a cookie that was underneath the box and the stick fell out and fell on top of her.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.200
Andy Serkis dressed up like Liam Neeson and rolled up in the house like,

03:59.200 --> 04:00.160
come with me.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.080
We're going to Baskin Robbins.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.840
And then they got in the car and-

04:03.840 --> 04:05.760
Come with me if you want Rocky Road.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.280
And then she looked and it's just Andy Serkis and he's covered in white.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.680
Magic effect balls.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.680
Let's ask people questions.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.120
Well, we're not going to ask people questions.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.320
That would be a pretty weird, like, reversal of our normal form.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.600
Why don't we ask questions and then just wait for the listeners to answer?

04:21.600 --> 04:22.080
Okay, here.

04:22.080 --> 04:22.560
Question one.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.040
How do you make a funny introduction to a podcast?

04:25.680 --> 04:29.440
We've tried 234 times and we can't do it.

04:30.720 --> 04:35.760
My SO and I currently have an anniversary coming up and we live in the same house.

04:35.760 --> 04:39.600
Recently, I walked into his office and saw part of what I immediately knew

04:39.600 --> 04:41.520
was most likely a section of my gift.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.280
It wasn't finished, but I could see what was happening.

04:45.280 --> 04:48.720
It was on the floor, so not exactly hidden or in the process of wrapping.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.360
Am I good?

04:50.160 --> 04:53.360
Should I pretend fake surprise when he gives it to me or should I come clean?

04:54.080 --> 04:56.000
That's from I Am The Ira Ray.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.560
Is that a confirmed Ira Ray?

04:58.560 --> 04:59.040
No, it is not.

04:59.040 --> 04:59.520
I don't know.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.080
It's a fucking Andy Serkis inside an Ira Ray suit.

05:04.080 --> 05:04.800
Yep.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.080
It's fucking garbage.

05:06.080 --> 05:10.960
But let's help them out regardless of the fact that they've just perjured themselves.

05:12.800 --> 05:13.760
You lie.

05:13.760 --> 05:18.640
I mean, you lie and you lie and you lie and you lie and you bury the truth in your heart

05:18.640 --> 05:22.320
where even you can't find it and you lie.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.960
Why aren't you just walking around your house if your anniversary is coming up?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.760
You got to put them present blinders on.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.480
You know what I mean?

05:28.480 --> 05:33.040
Like a month out before Christmas, I slice the pie before I go into any room.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.240
I throw a flash bang in there.

05:34.240 --> 05:41.680
I get a snake cam, I put it through the lock on the door and just like scope it out.

05:41.680 --> 05:42.240
And you know what?

05:42.240 --> 05:47.440
If I see the glimmer, if I see a fucking UPC barcode on anything, I leave the house

05:47.440 --> 05:49.120
and I come back tomorrow and I try again.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.480
And you plant some cocaine there.

05:51.360 --> 05:51.840
Why would I?

05:52.800 --> 05:56.720
Is that the definition of adulthood, the day that you stop looking for your presents and

05:56.720 --> 05:59.760
start actively trying to avoid where you think presents might be?

05:59.760 --> 06:05.760
Yeah, and bad on this dude for leaving these sweet honey pots out on the floor,

06:05.760 --> 06:08.080
haven't even started wrapping it, haven't even finished.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.600
Like he wanted you to find it.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.320
What if this is a faint, a faint attack?

06:12.320 --> 06:12.560
Yeah.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.440
What if it's a, what if it's like a double blind bluff?

06:15.440 --> 06:16.480
You're getting duped.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.480
Where you're like, oh, now I know what it is.

06:18.480 --> 06:19.360
But you don't.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.600
It's a car in the driveway with a bow on it.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.360
You thought it was going to be a bookcase.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.480
Ha, gotcha.

06:24.480 --> 06:28.800
Actually, he asked us to tell you here on the show.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.160
It's a look out the window.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.000
It's a 2008 Toyota Camry.

06:34.160 --> 06:34.880
How many miles?

06:34.880 --> 06:35.600
Only one previous owner.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.880
60,000 miles.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.480
One previous owner.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.360
I don't know.

06:39.360 --> 06:39.920
This sucks.

06:41.200 --> 06:45.360
We were hanging out with a couple, a friend couple the other night.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.520
It was before Christmas.

06:47.520 --> 06:48.240
A frouple.

06:48.240 --> 06:51.200
And we were all going around.

06:51.200 --> 06:51.920
We were bowling.

06:51.920 --> 06:55.840
And so every time somebody went up to bowl, their significant other said what they were

06:55.840 --> 06:56.800
getting them.

06:56.800 --> 07:00.880
And when they did this transaction with us, they were like, I'm getting them tickets to

07:00.880 --> 07:01.520
this show.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.520
And then they went up to bowling like, all right, what are you getting them?

07:03.520 --> 07:05.360
And it's like, I'm getting them tickets to this show.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.200
And it was the same fucking show.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.080
And I didn't know how to handle that situation.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.080
So I elected to do nothing.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.440
Oh, my God, Griffin.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.040
That's an impossible scenario.

07:15.040 --> 07:15.280
Right.

07:15.280 --> 07:18.400
You tell one person you've ruined Christmas for that person because then they know what

07:18.400 --> 07:18.960
they're getting.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.880
And they have to go out and get something else for that person.

07:20.880 --> 07:21.200
It fucking sucks.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.480
It ruins it for both of them.

07:23.440 --> 07:23.760
Yeah.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.160
I mean, you have to choose who you're going to ruin it for.

07:26.160 --> 07:29.280
Or I think you did the right call actually just letting it happen because that would

07:29.280 --> 07:30.720
be maybe like a sweet thing.

07:30.720 --> 07:31.360
It was bad.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.240
They survived.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.760
Their marriage survived it.

07:33.760 --> 07:36.080
So I guess everything came out.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.280
Can you tell us what the show is?

07:38.160 --> 07:39.280
Jersey Boys.

07:39.280 --> 07:42.400
So I guess I could go to Jersey Boys back to back nights now.

07:42.400 --> 07:43.360
I think that's the plan.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.800
And the second time they go back, they'll just like lean over to their neighbors and

07:46.800 --> 07:49.040
be like, oh, you're going to love this next number.

07:49.040 --> 07:53.280
They do a doo wop diddy that you might be familiar with.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.960
They sing it around a lamppost and then around a trash can that's on fire.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.840
Last night, he kind of buffed the G.

07:59.840 --> 08:00.880
So let's see if he makes it.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.240
He buffed the G, so let's hold up.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.680
Oh, God, landed it.

08:04.480 --> 08:05.360
Got it.

08:05.360 --> 08:05.680
Got it.

08:05.680 --> 08:06.240
Perfect.

08:07.040 --> 08:07.680
Be careful.

08:07.680 --> 08:08.800
Be careful out there, guys.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.560
It's a minefield out there.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.520
You not only have to be careful about avoiding your own presents, you have to avoid other

08:13.520 --> 08:14.240
people's presents.

08:14.240 --> 08:18.160
So you don't land in this thorny Kobayashi Maru that I landed.

08:18.160 --> 08:18.960
But this is the thing.

08:18.960 --> 08:24.000
This is the other half of present is like the gift that you give half of what you give

08:24.000 --> 08:26.480
them is like your reaction, right?

08:26.480 --> 08:28.320
It's not just the present you give them.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.160
It's the reaction of the present they give you.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.800
So, yes, of course, you have to lie.

08:32.800 --> 08:37.280
Of course, you have to act surprised because you can't just sit there and go, I knew what

08:37.280 --> 08:42.240
it was going to be because then you're robbing them of like the joy of giving you a gift.

08:42.800 --> 08:48.160
And if you and if you tell them ahead of time that, you know, you're doing something even

08:48.160 --> 08:52.000
worse, which is making them have to come up with another gift idea, which is already the

08:52.000 --> 08:55.760
hardest thing that any human being does ever right now.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.000
Y'all want to Yahoo?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.040
Please.

08:59.040 --> 09:05.840
This Yajuru was sent in by level 600 Yajuru Shaman user Drew Davenport.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.320
I don't know if he actually uses he probably has a Yahoo account, right?

09:08.320 --> 09:11.680
He's probably got like a Google or that pops up every time anybody posts any dumb shit

09:11.680 --> 09:12.240
on Yahoo.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.720
At this point, he probably just has like a force of people that just sends him stuff

09:16.720 --> 09:19.040
and then he sends it to us, right?

09:19.040 --> 09:21.600
He's got no he's got elves that work for him at this point.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.800
He can't hit all the houses.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.800
Well, they need work now that the hobbits wrapped up.

09:26.800 --> 09:31.360
Can we get people to just start saying hello to Drew on Yahoo answers?

09:31.360 --> 09:32.000
Just commenting.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.920
Hey, Drew, I'm assuming you're here.

09:36.240 --> 09:37.520
This is an anonymous user.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.640
I've never seen this before.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.760
There is no user information on this anonymous user.

09:43.760 --> 09:47.680
That's like maybe they got super blocked double blocked from or it's like the president.

09:48.720 --> 09:52.000
The president of the United States of America, Barack Obama asks.

09:53.280 --> 09:58.720
Barack Hussein Obama asks, what's a clever way to invite someone to medieval times?

10:00.640 --> 10:04.320
I want to invite someone to medieval times, but I need a clever way to word it.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.040
So that's not do you want to go with me?

10:07.760 --> 10:12.800
I can't find a way to ask with the theme of medieval times apparent in the invitation.

10:12.800 --> 10:13.760
Any ideas?

10:13.760 --> 10:15.840
Oh, my God, it's so obvious.

10:15.840 --> 10:16.560
What's that, Travis?

10:16.560 --> 10:17.280
What's obvious?

10:17.280 --> 10:21.120
OK, you have to fake some kind of accident or traumatic event, right?

10:21.120 --> 10:24.240
And then knock them out, probably with chloroform or some kind of drug.

10:24.240 --> 10:24.640
Right.

10:24.640 --> 10:29.280
But then you wake up in the medieval time and you act like you've traveled back in time and you have

10:29.280 --> 10:32.880
to escape this horrible time trap you've fallen into.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.600
You're you're talking about a black knight kidnapping.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.360
Yes, you're talking about a kid in King Arthur's court.

10:39.360 --> 10:42.560
And also, you did not come here willingly.

10:42.560 --> 10:42.880
Yes.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.000
An unwilling kid in King Arthur's court.

10:46.000 --> 10:46.640
What happened?

10:47.440 --> 10:50.080
Oh, man, aren't the Diet Pepsi's affordable?

10:51.200 --> 10:57.040
I don't think the illusion of medieval times is as thorough and complete as you think it is, Travis.

10:57.040 --> 11:00.240
Like that dude's taking a picture of the joust with an iPad mini.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.520
So I don't think it's not going to hold up for long.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.320
The first time you look at him and you're like, how did we get here?

11:06.320 --> 11:07.440
What did your friends like?

11:07.440 --> 11:11.200
Well, I got four bars, so I'll just call, I guess.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.480
Just call a taxi. Call my dad.

11:12.480 --> 11:12.960
Hold up.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.760
Hey, Dad, I think I got time teleported.

11:16.880 --> 11:17.600
Again.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.000
Again.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.680
I don't get it.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.200
I guess there was like we were like trying to banish the deadites or something.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.320
But can you come get me?

11:25.280 --> 11:27.440
Have you guys been to medieval times?

11:27.440 --> 11:28.560
Never in my fucking life.

11:28.560 --> 11:29.600
Are you kidding me?

11:29.600 --> 11:32.720
Justin, if you lose my mind, it's incredible.

11:32.720 --> 11:33.440
I don't doubt it.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.280
I love I mean, I love everything that got going on.

11:35.280 --> 11:35.920
Showmanship.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.520
Mutton legs.

11:39.520 --> 11:46.320
Now, I have not been there for 14 years, so I can't speak to how enjoyable it is as like a full blown adult.

11:46.320 --> 11:49.440
I also can't tell you if the production quality is kept up.

11:49.920 --> 11:54.400
Well, it's great now, because actually, because they're like they're in like the pre Renaissance era.

11:54.400 --> 11:58.160
So oh, that's less, less, less jousting, more like bathing.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.400
Yeah, what more bathing?

12:00.880 --> 12:03.120
I guess maybe that's when they cracked that code, huh?

12:03.920 --> 12:06.240
When at what point did we as humans go?

12:06.240 --> 12:07.760
Our bodies fucking stink.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.400
I wish there was something we could do about this.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.000
Perhaps dunk ourselves.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.840
Could you slap slap with a glove?

12:14.560 --> 12:15.920
Huh, I challenge you.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.200
I challenge you to join me at medieval times at dawn.

12:19.920 --> 12:20.800
Here's what you're gonna do.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.080
You're gonna walk to school.

12:22.080 --> 12:25.680
You're gonna go, you're gonna run into him in the hallway, and you're gonna be holding your tummy like,

12:26.320 --> 12:30.640
my tummy, and they'll be like, what's wrong with your tummy, Stephen?

12:30.640 --> 12:34.720
And then you, Stephen, be like, I don't know, you tell me.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.080
And then you lift up your shirt to reveal your tummy, and it's covered in leeches.

12:39.920 --> 12:43.440
And then they spell out, will you go to medieval times with me?

12:44.240 --> 12:45.600
It's gonna take a lot of leeches.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.760
Oh my gosh, it's gonna take so many leeches.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.800
You're gonna need to buy them.

12:48.800 --> 12:53.760
You can get them on Amazon with Prime shipping, but don't leave them on there too long.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.840
You're gonna wanna get some extra blood in your tummy.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.760
You're gonna wanna put some extra blood in there.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.040
I don't know how you do that.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.680
I don't understand why you can't just be straightforward about it though.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.640
Why do people have to trick people and go on medieval times?

13:04.640 --> 13:05.680
Do you know how stoked I'd be?

13:06.560 --> 13:08.320
Why can't you just say, do you wanna go there?

13:09.040 --> 13:10.000
Do you wanna go there?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.480
It's like, you've seen it a bunch of times.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.320
But they want something, I get it though.

13:14.320 --> 13:18.320
You know, you want something, so many things in this life of mundane,

13:18.320 --> 13:20.240
you want something with a little bit of magic pizzazz.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.360
Can you hire a herald?

13:25.360 --> 13:27.120
Boop-boop-a-doo!

13:27.120 --> 13:28.000
I don't think, would you just crinkle us that?

13:28.000 --> 13:32.800
Mr. Travis McElroy requests the pleasure of your company

13:32.800 --> 13:37.680
as you journey through time to adventure at medieval times.

13:37.680 --> 13:38.880
Check yes or no.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.720
I don't think you would say time quite that much.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.840
It's a little bit redundant.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.080
It's time for adventure.

13:44.080 --> 13:48.080
Let's travel through time to have a good time at medieval times.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.400
What time shall I pick you up?

13:50.400 --> 13:51.280
Check yes or no.

13:52.160 --> 13:55.840
I got you a Morris Day at the time CD to listen to on the way.

13:55.840 --> 13:59.600
And we can read a copy of Time magazine to stay entertained.

14:00.560 --> 14:03.040
Travis, I know you've been seeking steady employment in Los Angeles.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.440
They season the food with time.

14:05.440 --> 14:10.000
I think that maybe you might've just stumbled into your new whole life.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.320
Cause you did a really great job.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.040
Thank you, Griffin.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.960
If anyone needs a freelance herald.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.400
To invite, specifically to invite people to medieval times,

14:18.400 --> 14:19.520
Travis will need a bugle.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.800
I will also do fancy parties.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.960
If you want me to introduce as people come in.

14:24.960 --> 14:28.800
And say like Lord Tom of Cruz.

14:28.800 --> 14:29.360
I'll do that.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.760
That's a pretty fancy party.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.040
Yeah, that's the thing.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.200
You're trying to, you want to set your shit apart.

14:35.200 --> 14:39.440
What's the crossover of Tom Cruise enough that Tom Cruise goes,

14:39.440 --> 14:42.720
but also they hire Travis to be a herald at the party.

14:42.720 --> 14:43.440
One to one.

14:43.440 --> 14:44.400
It's a circle.

14:44.400 --> 14:44.720
Okay.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.080
All parties.

14:46.960 --> 14:47.840
I got another question.

14:47.840 --> 14:52.880
Dear brothers, I'm making a career change by leaving the safety net of corporate auto insurance

14:52.880 --> 14:55.360
to instead own and operate a gaming store.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.560
Board games, card games, and role playing games.

14:58.560 --> 15:02.160
The store has a solid customer base, but recently competition has been spawning.

15:02.160 --> 15:03.040
And that worries me.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.840
How do I differentiate my brand?

15:05.840 --> 15:08.800
So my Pokemon will bring all the nerds to the yard.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.600
That's from Dungeon Master Dan in Iowa land.

15:12.880 --> 15:13.600
Dungeon Master Dan.

15:13.600 --> 15:16.080
Griffin, why you, why me?

15:17.520 --> 15:20.640
Just cause he mentioned Pachamon specifically doesn't mean that Griffin-

15:20.640 --> 15:23.440
How many of us have ever played in a Pokemon tournament?

15:24.240 --> 15:24.960
Me.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.120
I came in second place.

15:27.120 --> 15:27.840
Out of how many?

15:28.720 --> 15:29.680
Like 14.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.080
Nice.

15:30.960 --> 15:31.440
Yeah.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.040
I think you jack your prices up.

15:33.760 --> 15:34.320
Okay.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.360
Wait, what?

15:35.360 --> 15:36.000
Jack them way up.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.520
You gotta be the most expensive game in town.

15:38.240 --> 15:43.360
And that will help, you know, it'll, it'll, it'll help cut down on your losses,

15:43.360 --> 15:44.240
thanks to this competition.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.120
And it'll also make your shit seem like a premium product.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.720
Maybe if you spend an extra dollar 50 on a Pokemon expansion pack,

15:50.720 --> 15:56.320
you're going to get the, the, the holofoil magneton in there that you've always wanted.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.840
Your, your heart's true desire.

15:57.840 --> 15:58.800
That's what, that's what I'm saying.

15:59.360 --> 16:00.960
It's a mental connection.

16:00.960 --> 16:05.360
I'm on some Malcolm Gladwell Pokemon trading card game shit right now,

16:05.360 --> 16:08.720
where if people spend more money on their poke packs,

16:08.720 --> 16:11.600
they think in their brain, I should spend more money on this.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.520
And there's a better chance that I'm going to get a Mewtwo.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.440
But there's not, right?

16:15.440 --> 16:16.720
There's not a fucking, of course not.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.720
But it's, it's, it's all poke psychology.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.160
Maybe you could make your store a little bit more inviting.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.880
Like maybe make it feel like an event every time people go.

16:25.440 --> 16:30.480
Maybe have a couch there where people could watch TV or movies together.

16:31.520 --> 16:35.440
So you're talking about a couch where people can watch TV and movies together.

16:36.240 --> 16:36.880
Yeah.

16:36.880 --> 16:40.400
There's a store that just opened here in Huntington called Rare Drops.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.320
That's supposed to be a retro gaming store.

16:42.320 --> 16:46.560
And I walked in and there's just people sitting on a couch watching TV.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.320
And I couldn't figure out how to buy things there,

16:48.320 --> 16:49.920
but it seemed like a pretty chill store.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.920
Did you walk into someone's house?

16:51.920 --> 16:52.960
This is like my house.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.120
Hey, this is like my house, but you sell Pokemon.

16:55.120 --> 16:55.760
I'm into it.

16:55.760 --> 16:56.320
I'm into it.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.200
They also had balls.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.200
So what do you mean?

16:59.200 --> 17:00.160
Like a ball pit?

17:00.160 --> 17:00.800
Balls?

17:00.800 --> 17:01.360
Oh.

17:01.360 --> 17:02.240
Oh, beals.

17:02.240 --> 17:03.280
Balls for the drink?

17:03.280 --> 17:04.000
Beals.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.440
You can make it like any gaming store I've ever walked into that seem to be popular.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.280
And while you stand behind the counter,

17:09.280 --> 17:13.040
chat with somebody about some really specific game that I've never heard of

17:13.040 --> 17:14.640
and don't make eye contact with me.

17:14.640 --> 17:18.240
So I have to wait really awkwardly to find out where the really weird thing I want is.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.240
Yeah, if you could do better than that, you're already ahead of the pack.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.000
I think maybe have it.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
If you set up a table with four chairs around it

17:28.000 --> 17:30.640
and just say like, listen, this is free to whoever wants it.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.440
It's there.

17:31.440 --> 17:32.960
You're going to get a crew together.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.480
It's like, you know.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.840
And they're going to plan a heist.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.680
You know, the old legend of the Cracker Barrel where people would gather.

17:39.680 --> 17:43.440
They put a chessboard on the Cracker Barrel and they'd sit at the cracker store

17:43.440 --> 17:46.320
and they every once in a while,

17:46.320 --> 17:49.200
knock over the board to get some crackers out of the barrel.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.000
You know how that goes?

17:51.120 --> 17:53.840
Maybe you need your own modern version of the Cracker Barrel,

17:53.840 --> 17:56.240
but it's like a card table where people could just play

17:57.920 --> 18:00.720
UNO or any other board games that are popular right now.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.880
What the fuck have you been talking about?

18:03.920 --> 18:05.040
You know, Griffin.

18:05.040 --> 18:08.320
You know how we would gather around the Cracker Barrel.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.640
And there were crackers in the barrel.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.760
That's not a great play.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.680
You're going to have some staleness issues.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.440
You have to carefully lift up the board.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.080
So Steve can get a cracker like every five minutes.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.040
Can I get a cracker?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.560
We just fucking started.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.240
We just fucking started this game of checkers.

18:24.880 --> 18:25.760
We're both super good.

18:25.760 --> 18:26.400
So it's going to go.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.080
Please just one cracker.

18:28.080 --> 18:28.720
I'm real.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.480
I'm eating some chili over here.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.080
I need something to dunk a brew.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.640
Just one cracker.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.360
Come on, guys.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.360
But it's never just one cracker.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.840
It's never just one fucking cracker with you, Steve.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.960
Old Steve three crackers, they call him.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.840
It's the only cracker store in town.

18:51.840 --> 18:52.320
Come on.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.920
I don't have to drive to Texarkana to get my cracker fix.

18:57.920 --> 18:58.880
Please.

18:58.880 --> 18:59.440
You can play.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.280
You can set up another game of checkers.

19:02.080 --> 19:02.720
All right, Steve.

19:02.720 --> 19:03.680
We're going to pick up the board.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.760
You get all the crackers you want now.

19:05.760 --> 19:06.080
All right.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.600
We don't want to have to lift it up again.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.280
Okay, let me just get.

19:09.280 --> 19:13.600
Well, guys, I needed them all, but I still want some.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.880
Steve, we specifically said get all the crackers.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.120
Okay, we're going to do it one more time.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.160
One more time, Steve.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.280
Why don't you just have two barrels?

19:26.560 --> 19:29.280
What do you think we are, the Rockefellers, Steve?

19:29.280 --> 19:31.280
You could play your game like on the porch.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.120
Just set it down on the porch floor.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.320
Maybe if we had some kind of giant carpet rug chess board,

19:36.320 --> 19:37.680
but that's ridiculous.

19:37.680 --> 19:41.840
Well, let me knit one of those up for you, Cracker Barrel LLC.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.400
Get there.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.400
Get there for Pancake Sunday Fun Day.

19:47.760 --> 19:48.160
You know what?

19:50.080 --> 19:51.520
Here's my God's honest answer.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.160
Because we've been playing D&D for the Adventure Zone,

19:54.160 --> 19:57.920
our new hit podcast, and I've gotten a lot of tweets

19:57.920 --> 20:03.280
from people saying, how easy is it for us to play D&D?

20:04.320 --> 20:05.200
And it's not just that.

20:05.200 --> 20:09.360
Like whenever we write on Polygon about a local gaming experience,

20:09.360 --> 20:12.080
be it a board game or a local video game,

20:12.080 --> 20:13.280
people always say, this looks fun,

20:13.280 --> 20:14.720
but I don't have anybody to play it with.

20:14.720 --> 20:18.720
I still feel like there's shit like Meetup and all that stuff.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.640
But I feel like if you can come up with some way

20:20.640 --> 20:26.000
of getting people together,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.640
like some sort of dating service,

20:28.640 --> 20:32.960
but platonic, Catan matchups.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.760
I really do feel like that's something that,

20:35.760 --> 20:38.640
I'm sure there's absolutely lots of solutions for that.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.160
I know that Dragon's Lair,

20:40.160 --> 20:44.160
my local friendly neighborhood game store does that,

20:44.160 --> 20:45.520
but I don't know.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.720
I just feel like there's still,

20:46.720 --> 20:48.480
that's still something waiting to be mastered.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.720
And if you can crack that code, like fuck yeah,

20:50.720 --> 20:51.760
I would get down on that.

20:51.760 --> 20:55.120
How about every Saturday, like you demo a new game, right?

20:55.120 --> 20:58.320
And then you offer a discount on that game during the demo.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.080
So it's like, we're gonna break out the Bioshock.

21:00.080 --> 21:00.880
It's a great idea.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.480
Thank you.

21:02.480 --> 21:03.920
And it's a great idea to do a clinic

21:03.920 --> 21:06.160
and teach people how to play a game.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.560
Like have somebody who actually knows the game

21:08.560 --> 21:10.080
and then have them teach other people.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.240
And then those people could have like groups

21:12.240 --> 21:13.600
and you could just have like a day

21:13.600 --> 21:14.720
where people play that thing.

21:15.280 --> 21:17.040
Maybe a clinic is the first hour.

21:17.040 --> 21:17.920
And then the rest of the day,

21:17.920 --> 21:20.400
it's just like get a game together and play it.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.840
Cause that's always the, like for me,

21:22.640 --> 21:23.600
opening up a new game,

21:23.600 --> 21:25.520
you spend the first 45 minutes saying like,

21:25.520 --> 21:26.240
oh wait, hold on.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.320
I think we're supposed to, okay, yeah, great.

21:28.320 --> 21:31.040
So just to have a dude there who's played it already before

21:31.040 --> 21:32.960
and figured that out who says like, okay, yeah,

21:32.960 --> 21:34.240
if you wanna do that, you gotta do this.

21:34.800 --> 21:37.120
And then, you know, you have like a popcorn machine

21:37.120 --> 21:38.880
or something and you let people go to town

21:38.880 --> 21:39.600
and make it a thing.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.400
Also, I don't wanna be mean,

21:42.960 --> 21:44.400
but if you could make your store

21:44.400 --> 21:46.080
the best smelling game store in town.

21:47.440 --> 21:47.920
Cool, cool.

21:47.920 --> 21:51.760
And I'm not just talking about like BO or whatever

21:51.760 --> 21:55.440
cause the one I used to go to in Cincinnati

21:55.440 --> 21:57.120
was very clean,

21:57.120 --> 22:01.360
but it also smelled like really strong cleaning products

22:01.360 --> 22:02.160
all the time.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.440
I would go in there for it.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.120
You know what's gonna fix that Griffin?

22:05.120 --> 22:06.480
Popcorn machine.

22:06.480 --> 22:07.680
Popcorn machine, maybe.

22:07.680 --> 22:09.920
I mean, yeah, well,

22:09.920 --> 22:12.000
cause you could get the BO popcorn smell

22:12.000 --> 22:14.640
and then it's just gonna sound like a stinky regatta

22:14.640 --> 22:17.200
and you don't want a stinky regatta smell.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.280
You just fucking Febreze it,

22:19.280 --> 22:20.320
neutralize the smell.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.840
I want it to smell like nothing.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.200
Travis was kidding about this,

22:23.200 --> 22:27.920
but you could honestly like in so many specialty stores

22:27.920 --> 22:29.360
that I've been to in my life,

22:29.360 --> 22:32.160
you could make a huge leap forward

22:32.160 --> 22:35.280
just like being personable

22:35.280 --> 22:37.680
and like welcoming people when they come into the store

22:37.680 --> 22:39.120
and like acting like you actually want them

22:39.120 --> 22:40.240
to spend money there.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.080
Like I'm not even joking.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.400
It's a pervasive issue.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.640
Make people feel welcome and don't eyeball them

22:46.640 --> 22:47.920
like you think they're gonna steal

22:47.920 --> 22:49.440
every time somebody walks into the store.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.160
That for me is like every time I walk in,

22:52.160 --> 22:54.720
I'm like, I'm a pretty average looking dude

22:54.720 --> 22:56.960
and I get eyeballed every time I walk into anywhere.

22:56.960 --> 22:57.920
And if you're worried about that,

22:57.920 --> 22:59.440
only sell huge board games.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.320
Nobody's ever shoplifted a copy of Lords of Waterdeep

23:02.320 --> 23:05.600
cause that thing is the size of a fucking like coffin.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.600
It's like shoplifting a coffin.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.160
You can't do it.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.120
You guys wanna Yahoo?

23:09.120 --> 23:10.560
Oh, can't I?

23:10.560 --> 23:12.320
Challenge accepted.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.120
By the way, Travis,

23:13.120 --> 23:16.400
just not to like cause drama or like derail,

23:17.200 --> 23:20.880
you look like if anyone's ever looked like a fucking brigand,

23:20.880 --> 23:21.600
it's you.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.160
Fair enough.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.520
Not like a skeezy thief,

23:23.520 --> 23:27.040
but like a kind of cool Douglas Fairbanks thief.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.760
Do you guys think I could pull off like a roguish scar

23:29.760 --> 23:30.560
across my eye?

23:31.200 --> 23:32.000
I think you, yeah.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.680
I think you absolutely should get out there Trav

23:33.680 --> 23:35.200
and I think you should start living hard

23:35.200 --> 23:36.320
and I think you should get cut.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.240
Thank you Griffin.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.360
If you keep eating the way you're eating,

23:39.360 --> 23:41.440
you're gonna get a roguish scar across where your heart is

23:41.440 --> 23:42.240
because of the stint.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.800
I have been eating so much better.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.000
It's 2015.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.840
I have been eating vegetables.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.080
I have been eating more vegetables

23:50.080 --> 23:52.480
and I've been eating even more vegetables.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.080
You don't need to make a production out of it.

23:54.640 --> 23:57.600
This Yahoo was sent in by Dan Green.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.160
Thank you, Dan.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.680
It's by Yahoo Answers user,

23:59.680 --> 24:01.440
Eric the Bean, who asks.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.200
Help, a witch turned me into bean.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.880
Need anti-bean spell.

24:08.400 --> 24:08.800
Dear wizards.

24:08.800 --> 24:09.840
Need to break curse.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.560
Eric the Bean asks,

24:12.560 --> 24:15.920
if Obama proposed a law saying Obama

24:15.920 --> 24:18.800
shall be supreme judge over all Americans.

24:18.800 --> 24:19.680
Okay.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.640
And single-handedly determine,

24:22.640 --> 24:24.480
carry out and interpret the life

24:24.480 --> 24:26.560
and death determination of every American.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.240
And right before that,

24:28.240 --> 24:30.240
pass a constitutional amendment saying

24:30.240 --> 24:33.600
all other amendments in the entire U.S. Constitution

24:33.600 --> 24:36.080
are hereby repealed and no longer apply.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.600
And at gunpoint,

24:37.600 --> 24:41.200
all 50 states ratified it for fear of being shot.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.720
I'm gonna shoot you Nebraska.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.320
Would you vote in support of a ballot question

24:46.320 --> 24:48.160
giving Obama the right to determine

24:48.160 --> 24:50.880
who in USA shall live and who shall die,

24:50.880 --> 24:53.440
knowing if you vote no on this

24:53.440 --> 24:58.160
and 99.9997% of Americans fearfully vote yes,

24:58.160 --> 25:00.400
you will probably be rounded up and killed.

25:01.200 --> 25:01.840
Wow.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.040
A lot to unpack.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.600
There's a lot to think about here.

25:05.600 --> 25:09.040
I mean, this person got our governmental,

25:09.040 --> 25:10.720
like, structure checks and balances,

25:10.720 --> 25:12.240
separation of powers, fucking aces.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.080
I saw that episode of Schoolhouse Rock

25:14.080 --> 25:14.880
where the thing was like,

25:14.880 --> 25:18.640
I'm just a bill, yes, I'm only a bill,

25:18.640 --> 25:21.680
and the president can kill anyone.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.880
Good, good news, Billy.

25:24.880 --> 25:28.000
I survived the president's supreme judgment.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.440
Okay, so break it down for me, Griffin.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.240
The deal is-

25:32.240 --> 25:34.160
Separate this and, like, parse this out.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.880
Can, if Obama proposed a law saying

25:36.880 --> 25:38.800
Obama shall be supreme judge over all Americans.

25:38.800 --> 25:39.440
Okay.

25:39.440 --> 25:40.800
He could single-handedly determine,

25:40.800 --> 25:41.920
carry out and interpret the life

25:41.920 --> 25:43.440
or death determination of every American.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.800
I guess that just means, like, Steve Johnson,

25:46.800 --> 25:47.840
fuck him dead.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.480
I'm making a list and I'm checking it twice.

25:51.920 --> 25:53.920
If the states don't ratify it,

25:55.040 --> 25:57.120
President Obama will shoot the state.

25:57.120 --> 25:57.520
Got it.

25:58.560 --> 26:01.200
And I'm still a little confused about the logistics of that.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.680
Would you vote for it?

26:04.400 --> 26:08.800
Because if you vote no and it passes, you'll be dead.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.120
So the first thing I want to hit here is,

26:11.120 --> 26:14.800
has this gentleman, like, seen President Obama lately?

26:14.800 --> 26:17.520
I don't think the dude wants to be president anymore.

26:17.520 --> 26:19.120
I don't like it anymore.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.800
He doesn't really look like he's having,

26:21.440 --> 26:23.120
like, a grand old time doing it.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.080
He's probably just about done.

26:26.080 --> 26:28.160
But what I'm saying is he's been, like,

26:28.160 --> 26:31.760
he's been, like, he's in his fucking, like, fourth quarter now.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.920
And he's, like, lost his mind.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.720
I love it.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.400
I love seeing him pull out the big guns

26:36.400 --> 26:38.400
and be, like, two free years of college.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.400
Eat my butt.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.520
Two free years of college.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.320
How about that?

26:42.320 --> 26:44.080
Oh, a Keystone pipeline, you're going to build that?

26:44.080 --> 26:47.840
How about the Keystone pipeline into my butt,

26:47.840 --> 26:48.880
which is where you're going?

26:49.920 --> 26:51.040
I think that this dude's,

26:51.040 --> 26:52.800
I think if he keeps, you know,

26:52.800 --> 26:55.280
pulling off these grand gestures,

26:55.280 --> 26:56.160
and, yeah, I love it,

26:57.120 --> 27:00.960
maybe on, like, day, you know, his last day in office,

27:00.960 --> 27:02.960
he's, like, let me just try one last thing.

27:02.960 --> 27:03.920
Supreme judgment.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.680
But then what if his supreme judgment,

27:05.680 --> 27:07.040
he's, like, a party dude?

27:07.040 --> 27:08.160
And he's, like, hey,

27:08.160 --> 27:09.440
because that's where he's been going now,

27:09.440 --> 27:10.320
as far as I can tell.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.160
And he's just, like, hey, here's my judgment.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.360
Everybody party on.

27:13.360 --> 27:14.400
Free pizzas.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.640
Everybody gets a $5 hot and ready.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.560
What if he names himself supreme judge and says,

27:18.560 --> 27:20.000
I just granted myself the power to decide

27:20.000 --> 27:21.360
who lives and who dies.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.960
And then the next thing he says is,

27:23.520 --> 27:24.640
hey, you're all cool.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.720
And then we all, and he's, like,

27:26.720 --> 27:29.120
but remember this, you owe me.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.440
I spared you today.

27:31.440 --> 27:32.480
And for the rest of your life,

27:32.480 --> 27:33.840
you have to go around knowing, like, man,

27:33.840 --> 27:35.280
Obama could have blown me out of the sky.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.200
Could have gotten real fucking bad,

27:37.200 --> 27:39.920
but it didn't because Obama was pretty tight that day.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.440
What if he just says, like,

27:41.440 --> 27:43.520
everybody lives and abolishes death?

27:44.400 --> 27:45.200
Oh, my God.

27:45.200 --> 27:45.920
Whoa.

27:45.920 --> 27:46.420
Whoa.

27:48.080 --> 27:50.240
It's the tuck everlasting amendment.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.760
All these other amendments are out.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.600
New, and I'm going to pass some new ones.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.600
These are my midnight amendments.

27:55.600 --> 27:56.960
Number one, be cool.

27:59.920 --> 28:00.960
Sorry, Obama.

28:00.960 --> 28:01.520
What was that?

28:01.520 --> 28:08.000
Be cool. Amendment two, come on.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.480
Uh, breaking news coming from, uh,

28:10.480 --> 28:12.000
I'm Wolf Blitzer, breaking news.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.160
The internet has been shut down

28:14.160 --> 28:18.640
because of a almost conical terminal violation

28:18.640 --> 28:20.720
of the first midnight amendment.

28:21.680 --> 28:23.360
It was not cool at all.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.920
It could not be cool for like a second

28:25.920 --> 28:27.680
as Obama later clarified.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.400
And it has been completely deactivated

28:30.400 --> 28:31.920
via the button to shut down the internet

28:31.920 --> 28:33.600
that Obama kept under his ass this whole time.

28:33.600 --> 28:36.720
User, uh, user Kobe Sucks said,

28:36.720 --> 28:39.040
uh, Lakers suck my dick.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.360
That was a clear violation of the first amendment

28:41.360 --> 28:42.640
and he will be rounded up.

28:42.640 --> 28:43.600
The first midnight amendment.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.000
And he will be punished with the second midnight amendment.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.040
Come on.

28:47.040 --> 28:47.760
Come on.

28:47.760 --> 28:48.800
Now I'm going to, uh,

28:48.800 --> 28:50.880
let's go to Twitter to get some reactions.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.000
Okay. No, that's right.

28:52.640 --> 28:55.120
Uh, the whole internet has been shut down.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.680
Wow. I can breathe for the first time in like 10 years.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.520
Guys, the news slowed way down.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.800
I guess we can all celebrate that first amendment ourselves.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.480
Just fucking chill.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.040
You know, this whole Supreme judge Obama thing

29:07.040 --> 29:08.080
is really working out.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.440
I don't think it's a bad idea sometimes.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.560
I think, I think we've been in such a standstill

29:15.120 --> 29:16.640
governmentally speaking.

29:16.640 --> 29:20.240
I just fucking nothing's happening to make my life better.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.480
And I think that I think that's my favorite thing about

29:22.480 --> 29:25.680
my favorite thing about this question is the idea of like,

29:25.680 --> 29:28.640
you know, Obama hasn't been able to get anything done

29:28.640 --> 29:30.640
in his eight years of presidency.

29:30.640 --> 29:34.560
And so what he needs to do is one big thing.

29:34.560 --> 29:35.920
Yeah. Yeah.

29:35.920 --> 29:36.400
Yeah.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.320
And then just like, say like, you know what?

29:38.320 --> 29:40.240
I'm tired of not getting things done.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.080
I'm going to get things done now.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.280
But you know what sucks?

29:44.400 --> 29:47.440
You know what sucks is even if Obama was like,

29:47.440 --> 29:49.760
I'm the Supreme judge, everyone can just be cool.

29:49.760 --> 29:52.320
Shit's going to get real tight from now on.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.560
Fucking like Ted Cruz would be like,

29:54.560 --> 29:55.840
no, I don't want to be cool.

29:55.840 --> 29:58.160
It's our amendment right to not be cool anymore.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.320
And Obama's like, I repealed the Bill of Rights.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.440
It's just be cool now.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.480
You don't have a leg to stand on, Ted.

30:04.480 --> 30:07.280
Number two, come on, Ted.

30:08.000 --> 30:08.800
Number three.

30:08.800 --> 30:09.600
Nice.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.000
Nice.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.720
President Matthew McConaughey.

30:14.720 --> 30:18.720
So to review, the three midnight amendments are one,

30:19.520 --> 30:20.000
be cool.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.120
Two, come on.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.440
Three, nice.

30:25.440 --> 30:27.440
Nice, okay, got it.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.040
As long as you don't violate those three midnight amendments,

30:31.040 --> 30:32.080
you're fine, right?

30:32.080 --> 30:33.360
Like you're fine.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.720
Yeah, but even if you don't.

30:35.360 --> 30:38.720
But if you do, oh, the swift judgment.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.080
Holy shit.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.920
Blood will fill the streets.

30:43.680 --> 30:46.400
What if there's like a purge where one day a year

30:46.960 --> 30:48.960
the three midnight amendments don't apply

30:48.960 --> 30:50.720
and nobody's fucking cool.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.880
Everyone's like, oh, time to let my hair down.

30:52.880 --> 30:56.080
Fuck you, Lakers, I feel so right.

30:57.040 --> 30:59.680
And the judgment squads walk the streets.

30:59.680 --> 31:01.120
Bring out your uncool.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.640
My grandfather was uncool the other day.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.640
He said something slightly racist.

31:06.640 --> 31:07.920
Death to your grandpa.

31:07.920 --> 31:08.480
Not cool.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.800
I asked for grandpa, nice.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.080
I was playing Super Smash Brothers

31:12.080 --> 31:14.720
and my little brother walked in and unplugged my Nintendo 64.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.000
Not cool, Dylan.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.320
Not cool at all.

31:18.320 --> 31:19.600
Judgment will be swift.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.240
My friend Richard chose odd job.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.520
Not cool.

31:23.520 --> 31:24.800
Richard, you know the rules.

31:24.800 --> 31:25.840
He's harder to shoot.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.000
No odd job.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.080
But you aren't Richard.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.040
You odd job picking son of a bitch.

31:34.480 --> 31:35.440
Uncool.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.160
Uncool.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.440
As Obama floats in his judgment chair.

31:40.880 --> 31:44.000
This is the one day a year I get to use my judgment chair.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.920
Still worth all the, what?

31:45.920 --> 31:47.600
That's not a half bad Obama.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.320
Thanks, Griffin.

31:48.320 --> 31:54.560
I just talk like Dobber from Coach.

31:54.560 --> 31:56.160
Brothers separated at birth.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.280
It's a new year.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.160
It's 2015.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.120
The con is on.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.480
And that means that it's time for you to reinvent your life

32:14.480 --> 32:19.120
in a new form that is more pleasing to yourself

32:19.120 --> 32:20.080
and those around you.

32:20.080 --> 32:20.960
How are you going to do that?

32:20.960 --> 32:22.160
Well, you need a new career.

32:22.160 --> 32:22.800
What career?

32:22.800 --> 32:23.600
I got one.

32:23.600 --> 32:27.680
How about you learn one of the most in demand job skills

32:27.680 --> 32:29.840
going right now, coding.

32:29.840 --> 32:30.960
Heraldry.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.480
Heraldry is number one.

32:32.480 --> 32:33.760
Number two is coding.

32:33.760 --> 32:37.920
Make 2015 the year you learn how to code.

32:37.920 --> 32:39.520
And if you do want to learn how to herald,

32:39.520 --> 32:41.280
I'm teaching a symposium this weekend.

32:41.280 --> 32:42.800
There's still a couple spots available.

32:42.800 --> 32:46.640
It's $250, but the price of the book is included in there.

32:46.640 --> 32:47.280
Wow.

32:47.280 --> 32:50.320
Travis, I had a full high energy lead-in.

32:50.320 --> 32:53.520
I was about to nail the dismount on that ad

32:54.080 --> 32:55.840
and you completely-

32:55.840 --> 32:57.520
Well, Justin, I really want-

32:57.520 --> 32:59.520
That was a huge violation of the First Amendment.

32:59.520 --> 33:03.040
I was just about to say one month rails.

33:03.040 --> 33:05.760
You trampled all over Justin's First Amendment rights.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.760
Both of you can burn in hell.

33:07.760 --> 33:09.120
Do the ad yourselves.

33:09.120 --> 33:09.760
Justin.

33:09.760 --> 33:10.800
Sorry, I can't hear you.

33:10.800 --> 33:14.160
Obama's judgment chair is hovering over you in Austin.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.320
It's about to hit you with a death ray.

33:16.320 --> 33:16.880
So Justin.

33:16.880 --> 33:17.520
Sorry.

33:17.520 --> 33:18.560
Justice you, Griffin.

33:18.560 --> 33:19.120
Justin.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.000
Yes, dead Griffin.

33:20.560 --> 33:21.280
Come on.

33:21.280 --> 33:21.520
Okay.

33:22.400 --> 33:26.800
Imagine for a moment you can build your own websites overnight.

33:26.800 --> 33:29.280
Your resume could stand out when applying for a job

33:29.280 --> 33:32.800
because you know Rails, you know Ruby, you know HTML,

33:32.800 --> 33:34.640
you know GitHub, you know Groupon.

33:36.000 --> 33:36.480
You know Grubhub.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.400
You just fucked up a lot of stuff.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.760
Ruby and Rails are the same thing.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.120
GitHub is not it.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.200
Groupon is a coding language.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.400
You got that part right.

33:44.400 --> 33:47.520
One month rails is the easiest way to learn how to code.

33:47.520 --> 33:50.080
I did this with their HTML program.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.440
There are little 30 minute lessons.

33:53.440 --> 33:54.640
Some are even shorter than that.

33:54.640 --> 33:55.520
Most are.

33:55.520 --> 34:00.560
30 minute lessons for 30 days and you could be an expert in coding.

34:00.560 --> 34:05.040
Honestly, the hardest thing you're going to have is knowing when to stop

34:05.040 --> 34:06.400
because the lessons are really fun to do.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.040
Once you start figuring it out, it's a lot of fun to piece together.

34:09.040 --> 34:16.240
I knew a little HTML going in, but it really was an awesome way to learn.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.040
They've got a lot of great videos and tutorials.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.040
It works because you make the stuff along with them.

34:23.040 --> 34:26.560
You're watching, but you're also coding from the first lesson.

34:27.760 --> 34:28.560
It's really excellent.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.160
I might do this for the Ruby on Rails one

34:30.160 --> 34:33.440
because I've been having some trouble with my combined comparison operators.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.760
Will it teach me how to use Google?

34:35.760 --> 34:41.280
Probably in a roundabout way because you might end up Googling the URL.

34:41.280 --> 34:41.440
Cool.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.680
There's a one month iOS app.

34:43.680 --> 34:44.320
Build an app.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.120
Go build an app.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.560
That's how everybody's making money.

34:46.560 --> 34:47.680
You know that's where all the money is?

34:48.400 --> 34:49.600
They're all in the app store.

34:49.600 --> 34:50.880
I actually want to do that one.

34:50.880 --> 34:54.080
We've made $14 billion off of the Bim Bam, the app experience.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.400
Have we discontinued that app yet?

34:56.400 --> 34:57.520
No, please do not go buy it.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.040
Please don't buy it.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.000
Don't buy our shitty app.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.280
You should buy that app.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.320
We haven't done anything.

35:02.320 --> 35:03.280
We get a dollar.

35:03.280 --> 35:05.520
We get a dollar.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.080
It's like a roundabout.

35:10.000 --> 35:16.720
I don't know what I'd do without that crisp $20 check coming in every month from Libsyn.

35:18.480 --> 35:25.600
One month, 30 days, 30 minutes in each of those days and you can learn a new skill.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.840
Give them the URL.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.240
One month.com slash my brother.

35:30.240 --> 35:33.600
Typically, it's going to cost you $99, but if you join right now, you're going to get

35:33.600 --> 35:36.720
a one-time discount of 25% off.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.240
That's one month.com.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.520
And that's one, the word.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.360
You suck.

35:41.360 --> 35:45.200
Can I get one word out edgewise, Travis?

35:45.200 --> 35:47.440
I just want to make it clear that it wasn't the number one.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.000
It's one O-N-E month.com.

35:50.640 --> 35:53.280
O-N-E month.com slash my brother.

35:53.280 --> 35:57.200
And please, if you're in the LA area, do slash my brother.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.760
Slash his tires and then slash me across the face.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.280
Give me a roguish scar.

36:01.280 --> 36:02.560
Give her a roguish scar.

36:02.560 --> 36:03.280
I'm hungry.

36:05.680 --> 36:10.640
I was going to make an O-N-Eaters joke in there because of the one-month confusion.

36:10.640 --> 36:14.640
Because it reminded me of the O-N-Eaters joke from that thing you do the movie.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.120
Justin, I got good news for you, my hungry lad.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.120
Hit me with your best shot.

36:20.400 --> 36:24.720
I know your life is hectic and I know that you make bad snacking decisions from time to time.

36:24.720 --> 36:33.840
I know that you ate 14 meters of rope licorice the other day and that's not a solid decision.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.600
Eating up a lot of empty calories there.

36:35.600 --> 36:39.840
What if I told you you could get over a hundred nutritionist approved snacks

36:40.720 --> 36:42.320
through fucking Nature Box?

36:42.880 --> 36:43.840
Have you heard?

36:43.840 --> 36:45.680
Is Nature Box like a new sponsor?

36:46.240 --> 36:47.440
Have we had them before?

36:47.440 --> 36:48.960
We've had them like a billion times.

36:48.960 --> 36:50.320
Nature Box has something for everyone.

36:50.320 --> 36:53.920
All with zero artificial flavors, colors, or sweeteners.

36:53.920 --> 36:59.040
Zero grams of trans fats and no high fructose corn syrup.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.440
Get out of here, current syrup.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.520
Current syrup?

37:03.520 --> 37:04.800
Get out, current syrup!

37:06.080 --> 37:07.040
Let me hit you with this.

37:07.040 --> 37:10.000
You're having a, you got those three o'clock blues.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.080
Having a hard time getting through your working day.

37:13.600 --> 37:19.200
I mean, all three of our jobs are either non-existent or, you know, imaginary goofy bullshit.

37:19.200 --> 37:22.400
But it's three o'clock and you're in a slump.

37:22.400 --> 37:25.680
How about you chew on some sriracha roasted cashews?

37:25.680 --> 37:28.000
Or pistachio power clusters?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Or Big Island pineapple?

37:30.000 --> 37:34.400
Justin, that sounds like something that you can get into with your fucking Big Island lifestyle.

37:34.400 --> 37:35.840
I'm tired of living off sponge cake.

37:37.520 --> 37:38.560
Something a little healthier.

37:39.920 --> 37:47.120
You can try Nature Box for free with a free trial box that has five of their most popular snacks.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.360
You heard me, five free snacks.

37:49.360 --> 37:50.160
Five of them.

37:50.160 --> 37:50.960
Free.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.080
Snacks.

37:52.080 --> 37:52.880
Five of them.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.440
There's literally no reason not to do it.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.200
Don't miss out.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.160
Don't be a dummy.

37:58.160 --> 38:01.600
Don't be a hungry lad like my Big Island Justin boy.

38:01.600 --> 38:06.000
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother and you'll get a free trial box of tasty snacks.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.840
You're going to love these snacks.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.600
You're going to love these free snacks.

38:09.600 --> 38:12.880
If you say it three times and people remember it, that's like radio ads 101.

38:12.880 --> 38:15.040
And Candyman comes and says, eat some candy.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.360
And you say, no, I'm going to eat Nature Box.

38:17.360 --> 38:20.000
Yeah, naturebox.com slash my brother is the address.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.400
Fuck candy, fuck candy, fuck candy.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.160
And now you memorize that.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.240
Eat these free snacks.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.000
I should say nature box in there too.

38:28.000 --> 38:33.120
Got a message for Bobby and Bizza David from Nutter, Taker, and Eric.

38:33.120 --> 38:35.680
You're apparently friends with these gangsters.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.880
I feel bad for Eric.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.120
Yeah, he's Nutter.

38:39.120 --> 38:39.920
He's Taker.

38:39.920 --> 38:40.720
I'm Eric.

38:40.720 --> 38:42.240
But I want to be Nutter.

38:42.240 --> 38:43.200
You can't, Eric.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.080
You can't, Eric.

38:44.080 --> 38:44.640
You're Eric.

38:45.200 --> 38:49.120
Hey Bizza, I bet you're wondering why Bobby is making you listen to my bim bam again.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.640
It's so you can hear this message.

38:50.640 --> 38:52.960
Congratulations on getting married and stuff.

38:52.960 --> 38:53.760
This is super late.

38:53.760 --> 38:56.800
But as long as the brothers macro don't mention when this message was submitted,

38:56.800 --> 38:58.480
nobody has to know whose fault it is.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.400
And now a jingle from Griffin.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.840
You can't just do that.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.680
You can't just work like that.

39:03.680 --> 39:06.240
I'm not some sort of falcon.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.600
Oregon grinder monkey to dance for your dollars.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.400
But he will dance for you.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.240
Maybe you should reconsider.

39:12.240 --> 39:15.520
My friend Eric might have to have a word which is

39:15.520 --> 39:20.320
make a little chin music with him, Eric.

39:20.320 --> 39:21.280
Shouldn't Taker?

39:21.280 --> 39:22.960
No, I said Eric.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.800
It's time to earn your nickname, Eric.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.120
Earn your nickname, Eric.

39:28.880 --> 39:31.680
Bizza, I'm really sorry that Bobby made you listen to this episode.

39:31.680 --> 39:32.320
Yeah, what?

39:32.320 --> 39:35.760
Bizza, did you just like try it once and decide it wasn't for you?

39:35.760 --> 39:36.400
That's fine.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.120
Like that, I get it.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.640
It's not for everyone.

39:40.640 --> 39:45.680
But I don't know why Nutter, Taker, and Eric would go out of their way to tell us that you

39:45.680 --> 39:46.880
didn't like our program.

39:46.880 --> 39:47.760
Hey, brothers.

39:47.760 --> 39:48.800
Bizza hates you.

39:48.800 --> 39:52.080
Bizza hates your guts, but we got our message from people she hates.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.200
It's again, it's fine.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.000
We don't mind.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.160
We're just kidding.

39:56.160 --> 39:56.960
Happy marriage.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Got a message from Molly from Claire.

40:00.000 --> 40:00.800
Here's the message.

40:00.800 --> 40:01.920
I'm going to read it.

40:01.920 --> 40:04.000
Happy birthday, belated Molly.

40:04.000 --> 40:04.500
Nope.

40:05.680 --> 40:07.600
Happy belated birthday, Molly.

40:07.600 --> 40:14.320
I couldn't get Lorelei or Rory to do this, but I think it's pretty good next option.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.040
I love and appreciate you always.

40:17.600 --> 40:18.720
Thank you for everything.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.640
That's from Claire for Molly.

40:22.640 --> 40:25.920
I'm assuming those are those Gilmore Girls characters.

40:25.920 --> 40:27.120
I think it's Hunger Games.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.240
It's those Hunger Games.

40:28.240 --> 40:29.520
I think it's the Gilmore Games.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.800
It's time for the Gilmore Games.

40:32.800 --> 40:35.200
I don't want to have to hunt my daughter with a bow.

40:35.200 --> 40:35.840
You got to.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.760
I haven't seen the show.

40:37.760 --> 40:38.800
God, I wish I'd seen the show.

40:38.800 --> 40:40.240
I'd be making some really great goofs.

40:40.240 --> 40:44.000
We'll just say Gilmore Games and just slide that across the desk to SNL.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.720
Listen, SNL, you can have this one.

40:46.720 --> 40:47.200
We got it.

40:47.200 --> 40:47.680
Gilmore Games.

40:47.680 --> 40:48.480
Gilmore Games.

40:48.480 --> 40:49.280
This is bad.

40:49.280 --> 40:49.780
Okay.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.440
The Fraggles Games.

40:53.600 --> 40:54.560
Let me hit you with this.

40:54.560 --> 40:55.520
Gilmore Gate.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.320
Think about it.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.120
Just go ahead.

40:57.120 --> 41:03.440
It's about ethics in bed and breakfast ownership journalism.

41:03.440 --> 41:07.200
I've seen one episode and like- They live in Star Hollow.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.400
Is it like the OC?

41:08.400 --> 41:09.600
Because I would watch that.

41:09.600 --> 41:12.000
It's like the OC, but more wholesome and lovely.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.280
And I think she- Okay.

41:13.280 --> 41:16.880
So I think Lorelei has a friend who like can't remember her name.

41:16.880 --> 41:20.160
And I want to say it's like Flappy.

41:20.880 --> 41:21.680
I don't think that's true.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.080
But it's like a I think like a birdish name.

41:24.720 --> 41:25.920
Welcome to Gilmore Guys.

41:25.920 --> 41:29.360
Our podcast where we talk about what Gilmore Girls might be about.

41:29.360 --> 41:31.520
Gilmore Guys is a podcast.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.760
Another podcast beef foraged.

41:34.480 --> 41:38.640
I bet they actually watch it or have some vague idea of what the show's concept is.

41:38.640 --> 41:42.480
I watched several seasons of Gilmore Girls and I couldn't tell you what it's about.

41:43.520 --> 41:46.000
There are like 130 episodes of Gilmore Guys.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.200
Go listen to that podcast.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.120
It's got- Don't give them a free plug.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.000
I'll give them a free plug.

41:50.000 --> 41:50.880
It's a good podcast.

41:50.880 --> 41:52.320
The people on it are really funny.

41:52.320 --> 41:52.960
Fine.

41:52.960 --> 41:54.080
Here's your free plug.

41:55.600 --> 41:56.880
Oh, hey there, everybody.

41:56.880 --> 41:59.600
I'm Guy Branham and welcome to Pop Rocket,

41:59.600 --> 42:03.520
a new weekly show picking over the pop culture we all love to love.

42:03.520 --> 42:07.200
With me to talk TV, film, music, and anything else entertaining

42:07.200 --> 42:11.840
are journalist Margaret Wappler, academic writer and DJ Oliver Wang,

42:11.840 --> 42:15.520
digital strategist Wyndham Mitchell, and comedian Santina Muhoff.

42:15.520 --> 42:18.560
It's an intellectual and incredibly snark filled discussion about pop culture

42:18.560 --> 42:20.960
by five cranky Hollywood 30-somethings.

42:20.960 --> 42:24.000
No name calling, no rudeness, just straight talk and a lot of role play.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.600
I'm only 30-something for another year.

42:25.600 --> 42:26.480
Me too.

42:26.480 --> 42:30.000
And I don't tell anybody I'm 30-something.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.040
Pop Rocket comes out every week from MaximumFun.org.

42:37.440 --> 42:38.560
I have an awkward friend.

42:39.520 --> 42:43.040
Over the past month or so, he's been going to the local grocery store

42:43.040 --> 42:44.720
every Saturday to buy groceries.

42:45.520 --> 42:48.400
He does this because he has a thing for this girl who works there

42:49.040 --> 42:50.960
and she is a checkout clerk every Saturday.

42:51.760 --> 42:54.640
They don't know each other's names, but he's been doing things

42:54.640 --> 42:56.880
like buying healthier foods to try to impress her.

42:56.880 --> 42:58.480
We said that once as a joke.

42:59.440 --> 43:02.080
He plans to buy a flower soon.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.080
And while she is scanning his groceries,

43:04.080 --> 43:06.240
he wants to ask her what she thinks of it.

43:06.800 --> 43:10.720
And if she likes it, the plan is to leave it at her station.

43:11.520 --> 43:14.880
And when she tells him he forgot it, he will say,

43:14.880 --> 43:16.960
no, it's where I wanted it to go.

43:18.000 --> 43:23.200
How do I talk my friend out of this terrible plan confused in Coralville?

43:23.200 --> 43:29.040
Listen, bad news, our listeners have weaponized questions

43:29.040 --> 43:30.480
and they're trying to kill us.

43:32.800 --> 43:34.400
I just fainted for a second.

43:35.520 --> 43:40.160
You just deployed a viral toxin through your email to us

43:40.160 --> 43:42.640
and I breathed in the fumes and now I'm dead now.

43:42.640 --> 43:45.040
Again, my second death of the episode.

43:46.400 --> 43:48.160
I think it's romantic.

43:48.160 --> 43:49.360
No, fuck off.

43:49.360 --> 43:50.640
No, I don't, not at all.

43:50.640 --> 43:55.040
This person's just at the fucking savers trying to make a buck

43:55.680 --> 43:58.080
and your friend is gonna squeeze her out of her skin.

43:59.280 --> 44:00.800
Well, I have been over this.

44:01.680 --> 44:04.560
Let's hit this point again because apparently it didn't sink in.

44:05.360 --> 44:10.480
If the person you're talking to, man or woman, cannot leave-

44:10.480 --> 44:11.600
Can't run away from you full speed.

44:11.600 --> 44:15.040
Can't run away from your fucking whack game,

44:15.040 --> 44:21.760
then you cannot attempt to get a date with that person.

44:21.760 --> 44:23.520
It's not a lady zoo.

44:23.520 --> 44:24.960
Let me make a broader point.

44:26.160 --> 44:27.680
I agree with you, Justin, 100%.

44:27.680 --> 44:28.640
Here's my broader point.

44:28.640 --> 44:30.720
If you were about to fucking step in here and say

44:30.720 --> 44:33.040
this is not a half bad idea, I'll quit the podcast.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.960
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not at all.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.400
The exact opposite.

44:36.400 --> 44:40.480
My point is this, the idea of doing a big romantic gesture

44:40.480 --> 44:43.840
already only works if they were already going to,

44:43.840 --> 44:45.360
and this is outside of this realm,

44:45.360 --> 44:46.240
because you're right, ladies,

44:46.240 --> 44:48.240
I'm taking this to a different level.

44:48.240 --> 44:50.560
So imagine it's not an employee of a place.

44:50.560 --> 44:52.400
If you're gonna do a big romantic gesture,

44:52.400 --> 44:54.880
it only works if they also would have said yes

44:54.880 --> 44:56.320
if you would have just asked them.

44:56.320 --> 44:58.560
I don't believe that there's a person who would have said no

44:58.560 --> 45:00.240
if you just say like, hey, wanna go on a date?

45:00.240 --> 45:02.240
But then you like leave a rose at their station

45:02.240 --> 45:04.320
and they're like, okay, now I'll say yes.

45:05.040 --> 45:07.920
But we think that like big romantic gesture tips the scales.

45:07.920 --> 45:10.960
But really what it does is it just sets you up to be like,

45:10.960 --> 45:14.320
if it goes bad, it goes way worse.

45:15.360 --> 45:17.920
I just think that a romantic gesture

45:17.920 --> 45:22.800
for the initial incitement of a romance

45:22.800 --> 45:26.720
is like a very uncomfortable play,

45:26.720 --> 45:29.920
because it's a very tenuous situation.

45:29.920 --> 45:33.840
And like, I don't know, it just, it makes me very uncomfortable.

45:33.840 --> 45:34.880
Doesn't even factor in,

45:34.880 --> 45:37.440
because if this person had been getting vibes

45:37.440 --> 45:40.160
from the cashier, if she was craving his wave,

45:40.160 --> 45:41.600
his awkward, awkward wave,

45:42.400 --> 45:45.120
then he would like probably have picked up on that

45:45.120 --> 45:46.240
and just asked her out.

45:46.240 --> 45:48.800
But this doesn't sound like that type of dude.

45:48.800 --> 45:52.800
Yeah, it's just, man, this just sucks.

45:55.360 --> 45:57.440
I get your discomfort

45:57.440 --> 46:00.080
because it's hard to like talk to a friend out of that

46:00.080 --> 46:02.400
because I've certainly had friends

46:02.400 --> 46:05.600
who thought that this is just how the fucking world works.

46:06.960 --> 46:09.760
And it's hard to like shatter the illusion for them,

46:09.760 --> 46:11.600
but goddamn, somebody's got to.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.560
Well, the other side of this is what you're not saying is,

46:15.600 --> 46:17.760
basically what he's doing is he's afraid,

46:17.760 --> 46:20.080
because this is a thing that his backup,

46:20.080 --> 46:21.680
if she doesn't like the rose,

46:21.680 --> 46:22.880
he's not gonna leave it there.

46:24.160 --> 46:26.400
Or he says like, oh, thanks, I forgot it, great.

46:26.400 --> 46:29.600
And he's leaving himself out because he's afraid.

46:30.560 --> 46:31.920
And so it's the idea of like,

46:31.920 --> 46:34.800
he wants it to appear to be a romantic thing,

46:34.800 --> 46:38.080
but really it's that he's not willing to just ask her.

46:38.080 --> 46:39.440
And so like that in and of itself,

46:39.440 --> 46:40.640
I say, you say to your friend like,

46:40.640 --> 46:42.560
hey, if you're not ready to just ask her,

46:42.560 --> 46:44.000
then don't do this.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.600
Don't fucking sidestepping.

46:45.600 --> 46:48.320
Like it's gross, it sucks.

46:48.800 --> 46:52.640
It sucks to use this person's place of employment

46:52.640 --> 46:55.920
as a romance tool.

46:55.920 --> 46:58.000
Just leave them alone.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.360
If you wanna ask them out, just say,

46:59.360 --> 47:00.880
hey, I know this is weird,

47:00.880 --> 47:04.160
but do you wanna hang out sometime?

47:04.160 --> 47:06.080
But even that, like if you're not like fucking,

47:06.080 --> 47:07.120
every time you check out,

47:07.120 --> 47:10.160
every time you check out, just be like chatting with them.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.000
Like, yeah, I'm getting some fucking bok choy

47:12.000 --> 47:13.040
and trying to get my life together.

47:13.040 --> 47:14.800
And she's like, oh, cool, I like bok choy.

47:14.800 --> 47:16.480
Do you wanna talk about bok choy with me sometime?

47:16.480 --> 47:19.280
That's fine, but not like you left your bok choy

47:19.280 --> 47:20.080
here at the thing.

47:20.080 --> 47:22.320
No, that's for you, eat it, I love you, bye.

47:23.280 --> 47:24.800
That sucks.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.600
It sucks.

47:25.600 --> 47:30.640
Just be, the con is on in 2015.

47:30.640 --> 47:33.120
Love's not a con.

47:33.120 --> 47:36.400
Unless you're using it to get a lot of money.

47:36.400 --> 47:39.200
If that was the last sentence of this,

47:39.200 --> 47:41.120
and like also she has some diamonds.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.240
Or she's got a key card to the back door

47:44.240 --> 47:45.520
of the Savers that you need

47:45.520 --> 47:48.560
to pull off this $300 Savers heist.

47:49.520 --> 47:50.880
It's just sucks.

47:50.880 --> 47:52.640
Savers doesn't sell groceries either.

47:52.640 --> 47:54.720
So we've been saying some dumb shit this whole time.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.160
Why didn't I just say Kroger?

47:56.160 --> 47:58.560
I know that's a place where they sell groceries.

47:58.560 --> 47:59.440
I led you into that.

47:59.440 --> 48:03.440
I said Savers, Savers is basically an off-brand Goodwill.

48:03.440 --> 48:05.520
And I said it and you trusted me

48:05.520 --> 48:07.040
and I let you down again.

48:07.040 --> 48:07.440
Again.

48:08.320 --> 48:09.360
Do you want a yahoo?

48:09.360 --> 48:10.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:10.880 --> 48:12.880
Okay, have we made this clear enough?

48:12.880 --> 48:13.360
Don't do it.

48:13.920 --> 48:15.360
Over the past fucking six years?

48:15.360 --> 48:17.200
Yeah, I think we made it pretty goddamn clear.

48:17.200 --> 48:18.720
Don't ask people out at their jobs.

48:18.720 --> 48:19.600
That sucks.

48:19.600 --> 48:22.880
I've seen though, I've seen people in movies

48:22.880 --> 48:25.040
and TV say like, when do you get off?

48:25.840 --> 48:28.320
Is that, and that always seemed cool.

48:28.320 --> 48:29.280
Is that not cool?

48:30.800 --> 48:33.920
Okay, real quick, side note, Justin.

48:33.920 --> 48:39.840
I think that if the vibe is so clear

48:39.840 --> 48:41.040
and you're like flirting

48:41.040 --> 48:43.680
and it's just the natural next step progression,

48:43.680 --> 48:45.440
fuck it, do it, but not-

48:45.440 --> 48:46.240
You're right, Travis.

48:46.240 --> 48:48.000
It's not if it's pre-planned.

48:48.000 --> 48:48.560
Yes.

48:48.560 --> 48:51.040
If you need a whiteboard to figure it out,

48:51.040 --> 48:53.120
then it's probably not a romantic opportunity

48:53.120 --> 48:54.000
you should be pursuing.

48:54.560 --> 48:56.480
If it's like, oh, the obvious next step

48:56.480 --> 48:58.400
is that you're like talking and it's like,

48:58.400 --> 48:59.840
oh, hey, there's a line.

48:59.840 --> 49:02.320
Do you wanna just like grab coffee sometime and hang out?

49:02.320 --> 49:03.280
Totally cool.

49:03.280 --> 49:05.280
But not like this, like elaborate,

49:05.280 --> 49:07.760
like you get Danny in and you make a plan

49:07.760 --> 49:09.600
and you've built a model of the savers

49:09.600 --> 49:10.640
so you can act out

49:10.640 --> 49:13.600
and then Brad Pitt zip lines in to drop the rose.

49:13.600 --> 49:14.640
Like, no, fuck it.

49:14.640 --> 49:17.440
And you've got the acrobat guy stuffed into your cart.

49:17.440 --> 49:18.320
He's ready to pop out.

49:18.320 --> 49:19.440
Not for a reason.

49:19.440 --> 49:20.880
Just cause it looks really funny with him

49:20.880 --> 49:22.160
curled around your orange juice.

49:24.400 --> 49:25.280
Pardon me, but you have a man

49:25.280 --> 49:26.240
curled around your orange juice.

49:26.240 --> 49:27.200
Yeah, I know.

49:27.200 --> 49:34.720
It's right where I meant to leave it.

49:34.720 --> 49:37.760
I've got a Yahoo here that was sent in by Jessica Rosen.

49:37.760 --> 49:38.400
Thank you, Jessica.

49:38.400 --> 49:41.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Big Cheese, who asks,

49:42.560 --> 49:44.560
why there is no beef nuggets,

49:48.160 --> 49:49.520
but chicken nuggets.

49:51.040 --> 49:52.160
So the whole sentence,

49:53.120 --> 49:54.880
why there is no beef nuggets,

49:54.880 --> 49:58.320
but chicken nuggets.

49:58.320 --> 49:59.520
Let me try and fix this.

49:59.520 --> 50:00.880
Let me take my red pen to this.

50:01.440 --> 50:03.120
Why there is no beef nuggets,

50:03.120 --> 50:04.400
but chicken nuggets is.

50:06.080 --> 50:06.640
That's good.

50:06.640 --> 50:07.520
That's a good edit.

50:07.520 --> 50:08.320
Chicken nuggets is,

50:08.960 --> 50:10.000
but beef nuggets isn't.

50:12.400 --> 50:13.440
Why am this?

50:13.440 --> 50:14.240
Why that is.

50:14.800 --> 50:15.360
Why that is.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.560
Just move that is over.

50:16.560 --> 50:17.280
Pelabra jot.

50:17.280 --> 50:17.760
You got it.

50:17.760 --> 50:18.560
Just pick it up.

50:19.120 --> 50:20.400
Drop it in the middle of the sentence.

50:20.400 --> 50:21.120
Nailed it.

50:21.120 --> 50:22.000
Thank you, Ghostwriter.

50:22.640 --> 50:24.400
Why there is no beef nuggets though, for real,

50:24.400 --> 50:25.280
because I read this question.

50:25.280 --> 50:26.160
I was like, dumb.

50:26.160 --> 50:27.280
And I was like, wait.

50:27.280 --> 50:29.040
And I was like, wait a minute.

50:29.040 --> 50:30.320
And I was like, mm.

50:30.320 --> 50:32.640
There has to be a lab somewhere where like,

50:32.640 --> 50:34.400
the scientists at McDonald's are like,

50:34.400 --> 50:35.760
we tried everything.

50:35.760 --> 50:37.360
We've come at it from every angle.

50:38.960 --> 50:39.920
They got a good point though.

50:39.920 --> 50:40.800
There ain't no beef nuggets.

50:40.800 --> 50:41.680
There ain't no pork nuggets.

50:41.680 --> 50:42.800
There's beef jerky, I guess,

50:42.800 --> 50:45.040
but that's like super dry beef.

50:45.040 --> 50:47.120
That's like a different type of thing.

50:47.120 --> 50:49.360
And you know, Jack Links is on that nugget game now

50:49.360 --> 50:51.760
and they are nuggeting it so right.

50:51.760 --> 50:54.000
But I want to see it have more mainstream,

50:54.000 --> 50:55.360
soft beef appeal.

50:55.360 --> 50:57.440
Mabim Bam's got that soft beef appeal.

50:57.440 --> 50:58.720
But can we get that soft beef appeal at a Wendy's?

50:58.720 --> 51:00.480
You can have a chicken fried steak.

51:01.520 --> 51:03.920
So why don't you have chicken fried steak nugs?

51:03.920 --> 51:05.760
Give me those steak nugs.

51:05.760 --> 51:08.240
You know Guy Fieri's fucked with some nugs though.

51:08.960 --> 51:12.080
You know he's nugged basically everything at this point.

51:12.080 --> 51:12.880
If you know what I mean.

51:13.840 --> 51:14.720
I don't know what you mean.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.240
Oh, 420.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.440
420, blaze it.

51:18.320 --> 51:18.880
Beef nugs.

51:19.920 --> 51:22.720
Is it because it takes longer to cook?

51:22.720 --> 51:25.840
Is that like, is it a scientific problem?

51:27.360 --> 51:29.200
I think beef nugs would be good.

51:29.200 --> 51:31.280
I think beef nugs would be pretty tight.

51:31.280 --> 51:33.040
I'm kind of hungry for beef nugs.

51:33.040 --> 51:35.360
I'm kind of into beef nugs and it makes me sad

51:35.360 --> 51:38.240
because it's very rare that I get hungry for food

51:38.240 --> 51:39.120
that doesn't exist.

51:40.240 --> 51:45.120
Usually most of my hunger pangs are tied to extant items.

51:45.120 --> 51:47.360
You try to keep it to the corporeal world.

51:47.360 --> 51:50.000
I try to keep it to the material realm.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.120
But the problem is I crave material.

51:54.160 --> 51:58.720
The specific Everlasting Cobstopper from the movie.

51:58.720 --> 51:59.600
Oh dog, fucking forget about it.

51:59.600 --> 52:00.400
Remember how that thing looked?

52:01.600 --> 52:03.680
Weird colorful candies jutting out.

52:03.680 --> 52:07.360
Not like the fake ass Jawbreakers that they tried to market and sell

52:07.360 --> 52:09.440
and you stamp it and you put it on a lunchbox

52:09.440 --> 52:10.480
and you put it out there.

52:10.480 --> 52:10.960
Not that.

52:10.960 --> 52:13.600
You're talking about a tasty fruity asterisk

52:13.600 --> 52:14.720
which is what they're selling there.

52:14.720 --> 52:16.080
Yeah, I would party on that.

52:16.080 --> 52:19.360
My mouth would have a lot of fun with that thing.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.760
Why are there no motherfucking beef nuggets?

52:21.760 --> 52:23.760
Okay, now I'm moving on to the third phase

52:24.480 --> 52:26.800
where I'm just angry that there aren't any beef nugs.

52:27.920 --> 52:30.240
I think the fourth phase is negotiation

52:30.240 --> 52:32.320
and the last phase is beef nugs.

52:32.320 --> 52:36.560
And then I go out and I acquire the materials needed for nugs.

52:36.560 --> 52:38.400
There has to be a reason, right?

52:38.400 --> 52:39.680
Like this has to be a thing.

52:40.480 --> 52:43.200
Have we done any research to see if like in 1960

52:43.200 --> 52:45.520
McDonald's had like McBeef nuggets?

52:45.520 --> 52:46.400
What would you dip them in?

52:47.120 --> 52:47.920
A1, right?

52:47.920 --> 52:48.800
Easy answer.

52:48.800 --> 52:50.560
Fuck, we've already got, we have everything.

52:50.560 --> 52:54.960
It's not like somebody's like cracking away at a chalkboard

52:54.960 --> 52:59.360
trying to like connect the molecules needed to form this shit.

52:59.360 --> 53:01.120
We all know this shit, it's obvious,

53:01.120 --> 53:03.680
but everybody's too fucking afraid to do it.

53:03.680 --> 53:04.400
Not Obama.

53:06.880 --> 53:08.640
Last day in office.

53:08.640 --> 53:09.520
Supreme judgment.

53:09.520 --> 53:11.840
That's the fourth midnight amendment.

53:11.840 --> 53:15.280
Oh no, that was the third and then fourth is nice.

53:15.280 --> 53:16.400
Nice, we did it.

53:17.120 --> 53:17.920
You cracked it.

53:17.920 --> 53:20.560
I am moving into a new condo in the DC Metro area.

53:20.560 --> 53:23.680
What do I do about the awkward introductions with neighbors?

53:23.680 --> 53:25.840
Do I knock on their door with baked goods

53:25.840 --> 53:27.760
or ask what day trash goes out,

53:27.760 --> 53:28.880
see if they make the first move

53:28.880 --> 53:31.600
or accidentally bump into them in the hallway someday?

53:31.600 --> 53:34.080
Or am I just supposed to go about living my life

53:34.080 --> 53:36.720
and only give a casual nod if I ever see one?

53:36.720 --> 53:38.160
That's from moving in Maryland.

53:41.520 --> 53:43.200
There is definitely a window.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.920
Can we put an official number of days?

53:45.920 --> 53:50.720
Because my neighbors and I on the one side

53:50.720 --> 53:53.760
have like a very nice relationship.

53:53.760 --> 53:56.880
Like when we had the baby,

53:57.680 --> 54:00.320
they brought over like dinner one night,

54:00.320 --> 54:02.800
like very cordial, very pleasant.

54:02.800 --> 54:06.160
Do not know their first names.

54:06.160 --> 54:08.560
Do not know them.

54:08.560 --> 54:09.060
And Griffin?

54:09.060 --> 54:10.080
You're gonna steal their mail.

54:11.360 --> 54:14.320
Literally, if you guys have any clues.

54:14.320 --> 54:16.720
Why the fuck would I know it?

54:17.440 --> 54:19.920
I don't know how, like clues to figure,

54:19.920 --> 54:23.120
if you like have the phone number of a private dick in the area.

54:23.120 --> 54:25.040
You're gonna need to set up a hotline, Justin,

54:25.040 --> 54:25.600
so that people can call in.

54:25.600 --> 54:26.800
This particular case.

54:28.720 --> 54:34.800
Can we develop a name that sounds like every name?

54:35.520 --> 54:36.720
And then you can call them that.

54:37.440 --> 54:38.000
Grinchum.

54:39.440 --> 54:39.680
Hi.

54:39.680 --> 54:40.240
Grinchum.

54:41.280 --> 54:41.920
Jomagree.

54:42.560 --> 54:43.600
Jomagree.

54:43.600 --> 54:45.680
Jomagree, I feel like covers a lot of your bases.

54:45.680 --> 54:47.600
If it's John, Gregory,

54:49.360 --> 54:51.040
just if their name is Jomagree,

54:51.040 --> 54:52.720
you're fucking wow.

54:52.720 --> 54:54.160
You really split the uprights.

54:54.160 --> 54:55.920
I think the only solution is,

54:55.920 --> 54:58.160
I have to gin up a reason to write them a check.

54:58.800 --> 55:01.040
Like I have to come up with a reason to write them a check,

55:01.040 --> 55:02.800
so I can ask them how to spell the name.

55:02.800 --> 55:04.720
So I mean, that's all I know your name.

55:04.720 --> 55:07.440
What if they say like it's Steve or it's Jim?

55:08.320 --> 55:09.600
That's always sucks.

55:09.600 --> 55:12.240
That's the bad thing about that gambit is it's like,

55:12.240 --> 55:14.240
but you can always work your way out of it.

55:14.240 --> 55:15.920
Because every, it's 2015,

55:15.920 --> 55:18.800
there's more than one way to spell literally any name on the planet now.

55:18.800 --> 55:20.240
What I'm saying is you have,

55:20.240 --> 55:23.760
my problem is that I have learned my neighbors names several times,

55:23.760 --> 55:27.040
but our interactions are so rare that I don't,

55:27.040 --> 55:29.280
it doesn't get into the muscle memory.

55:29.280 --> 55:31.200
So you have to introduce yourself,

55:31.200 --> 55:32.160
I think right away,

55:32.160 --> 55:35.200
maybe just make some cookies and go around the neighborhood,

55:35.920 --> 55:37.360
tossing cookies to people,

55:37.360 --> 55:39.920
and then ask them their name and write it down.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.240
Put in your iPhone something right on the brim of your hat,

55:42.240 --> 55:43.120
so you can stare at it.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.120
Learn it early,

55:45.120 --> 55:47.840
but because once it gets past, I think like a month.

55:47.840 --> 55:49.360
Oh yeah, you're fucked in a month.

55:49.360 --> 55:50.640
It's over.

55:50.640 --> 55:52.400
We got a package,

55:52.400 --> 55:55.200
we got a neighbor on the left side named Terry.

55:55.200 --> 55:56.400
I love Terry.

55:56.400 --> 55:58.960
His fucking grandkids are always throwing footballs into our yard,

55:58.960 --> 56:00.240
so I don't love that Terry.

56:00.240 --> 56:02.640
Wish I could curtail that particular behavior.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.720
Be cool, Terry.

56:04.720 --> 56:06.160
Be fucking cool, Terry.

56:06.160 --> 56:07.360
Tell your grandkids to chill.

56:07.360 --> 56:11.760
I hope something happened to him when Obama comes calling.

56:12.880 --> 56:16.240
When we got back from spending Christmas in Huntington,

56:16.240 --> 56:18.880
we had a package for a Terrence,

56:19.600 --> 56:22.400
and it took us like a whole day to figure that one out.

56:22.400 --> 56:22.800
Really?

56:24.000 --> 56:27.520
When the number, the house number was one different from yours,

56:27.520 --> 56:29.600
and you have a next door neighbor named Terry,

56:29.600 --> 56:31.360
it took you a whole day to piece it together?

56:31.360 --> 56:32.720
How many Terrences do you know?

56:32.720 --> 56:33.840
It's not a common shorthand.

56:33.840 --> 56:36.720
I just, I picture Rachel Griffin like standing in front of a wall

56:36.720 --> 56:38.800
and there's like red yarn strung between

56:38.800 --> 56:41.280
all these like newspaper clippings and pictures,

56:41.280 --> 56:43.760
and it just says Terrence and is circled like eight times.

56:44.880 --> 56:47.680
And on one side it says Terry, our next door neighbor,

56:47.680 --> 56:50.320
and then it's like it's struck through like impossible.

56:50.320 --> 56:52.800
Name Terry is not named Terrence.

56:52.800 --> 56:54.000
Could not be him.

56:54.000 --> 56:55.200
Terrence Howard?

56:55.200 --> 56:57.040
Question one, question one, question one.

56:57.680 --> 56:58.880
I'm really disappointed in you.

56:59.440 --> 56:59.940
Okay.

57:03.200 --> 57:05.120
My guy on the other side is named Durant.

57:05.120 --> 57:06.240
That one's pretty easy to remember

57:06.240 --> 57:09.600
because you're not going to get a package for Dur.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.600
Hi, I've got a package here for Dur.

57:11.600 --> 57:12.080
I don't know.

57:12.720 --> 57:13.280
I don't know that one.

57:13.280 --> 57:14.320
This is for Durant.

57:14.320 --> 57:15.120
That can't be it.

57:15.920 --> 57:17.200
Durant-sus.

57:17.200 --> 57:18.800
I don't think I know a Durant-sus.

57:21.200 --> 57:23.360
What if it, what if the package is for David

57:23.360 --> 57:24.480
and you found out you've just been

57:24.480 --> 57:26.320
mispronouncing it the entire time?

57:26.320 --> 57:27.120
This is for Mark.

57:27.120 --> 57:27.760
I don't know Mark.

57:27.760 --> 57:28.720
Uh, hi Mark.

57:28.720 --> 57:28.960
Hey.

57:30.240 --> 57:31.520
Shut up Durant.

57:31.520 --> 57:32.560
What's your angle Durant?

57:32.560 --> 57:35.120
I got package thief.

57:38.000 --> 57:38.960
So this has been our show.

57:38.960 --> 57:39.840

57:48.480 --> 57:52.480

58:00.880 --> 58:02.480

58:04.080 --> 58:05.600

58:05.600 --> 58:09.280

We released a microscopic trailer for this announcement,

58:23.920 --> 58:25.520
but now it's time for the full thing.

58:25.520 --> 58:26.320

58:29.680 --> 58:33.440
Griffin's right eye, then it will open up a code.

58:33.440 --> 58:34.880
And if you can decipher that code,

58:34.880 --> 58:36.160

Is that the, is that the right?

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.360

That's a good one.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.120

If they had me, man, I'd do whatever.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.840
Griffin would just bring him drinks.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.920

I fucking hated that movie or no reservations with Catherine Zeta Jones.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.840
I think those are the two worst movies I probably ever seen.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.480

We watch a bad movie and then we talk about it.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.960
A bad movie podcast.

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.440
Isn't that like every fifth podcast on the internet?

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.040
I'd answer that by saying one,

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.120
we've been doing this show for over seven years,

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:17.200
long before the entire premise of our show was a cliche and two,

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:17.760
shut up.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.960
Sick burn.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.680
I'd say that our show is more of a comedy podcast,

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.080
a podcast about words that sound like other words,

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:28.720
a podcast about me singing long irritating songs like this one,

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.760
a podcast about pitches for a Ziggy comic book movie,

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.920
or discussions about sex tarps.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.440
Yeah, I mean, mostly it's a show about three friends just hanging out

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.520
and talking about ding dongs.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.560
That's mostly used to.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.440
Wait, what?

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.200
So if you like any of those things,
