00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
Hey everybody, Merry Candle Lights.

00:02.320 --> 00:04.200
It's your oldest brother Justin McElroy here.

00:04.200 --> 00:05.260
And here's your babiest,

00:05.260 --> 00:06.920
baby, baby, baby, Griffin McElroy.

00:06.920 --> 00:07.760
Hi.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.120
Happy holidays, Griffin.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.880
Happy holidays to you, my good friend Justin.

00:11.880 --> 00:14.440
So we're fresh off the, dare I say, triumph.

00:14.440 --> 00:15.720
Do we sound hungover?

00:15.720 --> 00:16.560
Cause we is.

00:16.560 --> 00:18.000
Yeah, we is hangover.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.080
We're fresh off the triumph of Candle Lights 2014.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.520
Thank you to everybody who came to the show

00:23.520 --> 00:25.680
here at Huntington City Hall.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.640
You're about to listen to the show right now.

00:27.640 --> 00:28.680
I think you'll be pleased.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.040
I think it's the best audio quality

00:30.040 --> 00:31.960
we've gotten from a live show basically ever.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.420
A wonderful surprise.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.180
Better than the audio quality of the people

00:35.180 --> 00:36.020
who are actually there.

00:36.020 --> 00:37.320
Which if you're there and you couldn't,

00:37.320 --> 00:39.000
you had trouble hearing us, sorry about that.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.360
The room was built long before

00:42.360 --> 00:44.720
amplified sound had been invented.

00:44.720 --> 00:49.520
And so I guess that maybe there's a lot of echoing.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.400
So sorry about that.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.640
Listen to it now and maybe you'll get the goose

00:52.640 --> 00:53.840
that you missed the first time around.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.700
Speaking of missed goose,

00:55.700 --> 00:57.480
since you're not physically there,

00:57.480 --> 00:59.240
a few things you should know.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.960
At the beginning, our dad is dressed

01:00.960 --> 01:03.000
like his character from the Adventure Zone,

01:03.000 --> 01:04.280
our D&D podcast.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.000
So if you hear people laughing, that is why.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Also he's just a silly looking man.

01:09.000 --> 01:09.960
Just so in general.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.560
And that is, what else do they need?

01:14.560 --> 01:16.920
Oh, we were dressed as the ghosts of Christmas

01:16.920 --> 01:19.680
from A Christmas Carol.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.440
So if you hear us referencing that.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.560
That's what that was.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.040
I'm sure you can find images of that.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.880
Yeah, just do a Twitter search.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.000
I mean, I don't want to introduce more work

01:28.000 --> 01:28.840
into our podcast.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.800
Listening to our podcast is already work.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.040
It's kind of a chore.

01:33.040 --> 01:33.920
So hoarse.

01:33.920 --> 01:34.760
So hoarse, aren't we?

01:34.760 --> 01:35.960
I know, it's a long night.

01:35.960 --> 01:39.720
But we hope you enjoy the live show.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.040
We'll be back in the middle

01:41.040 --> 01:43.640
to talk about a couple sponsors.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.100
But it's an extra-long episode,

01:45.100 --> 01:45.940
so make sure to catch up on that too.

01:45.940 --> 01:46.760
And it's clean.

01:46.760 --> 01:47.600
It's clean.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.660
If you want to share it with family,

01:48.660 --> 01:49.740
might be kind of a weird one

01:49.740 --> 01:52.000
since it was a live environ.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.200
But we hope you enjoyed it.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.600
Oh, and we also got a day named after us.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.440
Yes.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.260
By the mayor of Huntington.

01:58.260 --> 01:59.100
By the mayor.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.360
December 20, yesterday felt different to you.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.240
It was because December 21st, 2014

02:03.240 --> 02:05.200
was NBNBAM day in Huntington.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.400
That's true.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.100
That's not like a goof.

02:08.100 --> 02:09.120
We got a proclamation.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.320
It was signed and stamped and delivered.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.160
So there you go.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.060
There it is.

02:13.060 --> 02:15.560
So anyway, that's gonna do it for us right now.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.520
Hope you enjoy the show.

02:16.520 --> 02:18.520
We'll be back with you in just a few minutes.

02:18.520 --> 02:23.520
Thank you.

02:31.720 --> 02:36.080
I am Merle Highchurch of the popular podcast,

02:36.080 --> 02:37.740
The Adventure Zone.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.780
You can tell because of my dwarfy voice.

02:45.780 --> 02:47.080
The Adventure Zone,

02:47.080 --> 02:50.460
one of the four most popular podcasts in existence.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.860
All right, let's get down to business.

02:56.440 --> 02:57.680
Yeah.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.260
Did you wash your hands when you were done?

03:00.260 --> 03:01.100
No.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.640
Let us begin.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.800
The McElroy brothers are not experts

03:09.800 --> 03:12.500
and their advice should never be followed.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.800
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

03:14.800 --> 03:18.920
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.200
Also, this show isn't for kids.

03:22.080 --> 03:27.080
Well, this show kinda is for young adults.

03:27.660 --> 03:30.560
This show isn't for real little kids,

03:30.560 --> 03:32.420
which I only mentioned so the babies out there

03:32.420 --> 03:35.360
will know how cool they are for listening.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.640
What's up, you cool babies?

03:38.640 --> 03:43.640
What's up, you cool babies?

04:08.800 --> 04:13.640
Hi.

04:13.640 --> 04:14.460
Hi.

04:15.560 --> 04:21.280
Hi.

04:21.280 --> 04:24.120
Hey.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.960
He was at half masked before,

04:33.960 --> 04:35.040
but now we can begin.

04:37.420 --> 04:38.260
Hello.

04:38.260 --> 04:44.180
knew how many dubstep Christmas songs. There's a lot. You can fade the dubstep out, it's pretty

04:44.180 --> 04:52.820
terrible. Infinity dubstep Christmas songs. Hi everybody, I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

04:54.100 --> 05:00.180
And I'm the lead singer of the Polyphonic Spree apparently tonight. I'm Griffin McElroy. I'm going

05:00.180 --> 05:06.420
to have to take my mask off because my breath is fogging up my glasses because I'm the coolest kid.

05:06.420 --> 05:12.020
Yeah let's, does everybody have that out of their system? You get it? Can we take, okay.

05:13.780 --> 05:20.740
I can't, wait, hold on. I can't take off. This is like caked on for a week. I'm gonna be opening

05:20.740 --> 05:27.060
my presents like this. Oh we should say listeners at home, we had a hilarious opening bit where we

05:27.060 --> 05:33.620
were dressed as the ghosts and Justin, he has a lovely green robe and a... Are you gonna garrison

05:33.620 --> 05:39.620
Keylor this whole thing or can we just do the show? I remember in Lake Wobegon when three brothers

05:39.620 --> 05:44.420
would really earn attention. If you're listening and you're not here, I'm wearing like a cool pair

05:44.420 --> 05:50.820
of slacks that I got from Neiman Marcus and like a like a fashionable trendy but not too trendy

05:50.820 --> 05:56.580
plaid shirt and then like a square cut wool tie. I look awesome. He looks really great. You know

05:56.580 --> 06:01.380
what I actually learned? I'm wearing gaudy white face paint. Do you know how when you get a tan

06:01.380 --> 06:05.060
and it makes your teeth look whiter? The opposite happens.

06:08.340 --> 06:12.100
With that, what was the first thing we were going to talk about? All the show prep just

06:13.060 --> 06:19.060
because the first bit worked so good that I was like man that was funny and that's all I can

06:19.060 --> 06:25.140
think about right now. I spent 85 dollars on this costume all together. 90s are expensive.

06:26.340 --> 06:30.740
Another thing I learned, 90s are expensive and that I wear an extra extra large in women's

06:30.740 --> 06:37.620
for 90s. Perfect. These things are hard to urinate around but I suppose that's not really their

06:37.620 --> 06:40.980
intended purpose. Should we start doing advice? Well the first thing I wanted to talk about just

06:40.980 --> 06:46.180
to lead off is just a thank you that it's my brother, my brother and me. Happy my bim bam day

06:46.180 --> 06:57.700
everybody. Happy my bim bam day. I cannot stress to you, goofs aside, let's get genuine. That was

06:57.700 --> 07:01.780
a real honor. It was a really sweet thing. What an honor that was. It was like a really sweet thing

07:01.780 --> 07:07.460
and it was emotional like this is my hometown you know. I love Huntington but I noticed on the

07:07.460 --> 07:14.900
proclamation that it says that December the 21st 2014 is my bim bam day. It is not an annual

07:14.900 --> 07:20.980
occurrence and that's you know fine. Most people don't even get the one day. I do wish the mayor

07:20.980 --> 07:31.780
had told me in the morning that I got a day. That's like a snow day when you sleep till 11

07:31.780 --> 07:37.220
and it's like I missed half the snow day. To be more accurate it's like a snow day but you just

07:37.220 --> 07:42.740
went to class for like seven hours. It's like I got four hours of my special day left and I'm

07:42.740 --> 07:48.980
gonna spend it in clown makeup. Fantastic. Oh wait hold on hold on hold on. It's a huge honor.

07:48.980 --> 07:56.260
Huge oh my god. Huge honor no question. But what rights and privileges do you think we've earned

07:56.260 --> 08:02.100
from this? For the next uh three hours you're asking? Yeah like free fruit at every vendor.

08:02.100 --> 08:06.100
Like I don't know. Yeah at the fruit vendor. You know you know the fruit vendor.

08:08.500 --> 08:14.900
Huge fruit vendor population. I'm just saying I wish the mayor had had shook me awake at one in

08:14.900 --> 08:22.420
the morning. I don't know why he would be there. Griffin it's Steve. Griffin wake up it's Steve

08:22.420 --> 08:28.420
you're missing it. Um I wish Steve had shook me away. He's got a key to the city he can open any

08:28.420 --> 08:37.300
door. That's a great point. You look radical right now Justin. I'm saying my Justin is my fat Jesus

08:37.300 --> 08:42.260
look. He's removed his fat Jesus beard and now he's just got fat Jesus hair and he looks uh

08:42.260 --> 08:48.260
it looks pretty awesome. I this is the fullest embrace I could do of Jimmy Buffett style without

08:48.260 --> 08:53.860
actually going to like his concerts. I hope you guys enjoyed the Buffett buffet in the waiting

08:53.860 --> 08:59.700
interim uh that Justin definitely put together for you. I slaved over that playlist it only had

08:59.700 --> 09:06.020
two James Buffett songs. Can we answer some questions? Okay uh who here has never listened

09:06.020 --> 09:12.900
to My Brother My Brother Me before? Oh god wow so no one wondered off the streets of Huntington.

09:12.900 --> 09:21.860
I heard one woo that started like uh so we have an advice show uh for the modern era and now

09:22.820 --> 09:31.140
like Chilean miners we will emerge from no Chilean miners aren't still hot.

09:31.140 --> 09:37.780
Well no. You know what it's candle nights do it again I'm gonna lean into it. Okay like Chilean

09:37.780 --> 09:45.460
miners emerging from the ground. It's been 38 minutes can we answer a question? Yeah um we

09:45.460 --> 09:52.180
turn your questions alchemy like into wisdom it's what we do here on the show uh so let's take some

09:52.180 --> 09:58.420
of your questions uh some of you may be in the audience uh so if you uh hear your question

09:58.420 --> 10:06.820
and start listening because we're gonna answer it and we're not gonna read it twice and if you

10:06.820 --> 10:14.340
don't hear your question it was bad. You did a bad job. Maybe next candle nights although next

10:14.340 --> 10:19.060
year is a candle night sleeping. Candle nights 2015. No candle nights next year but 2016 you

10:19.060 --> 10:24.420
come back double hard. Every four and a half years. I have a close family this is the question

10:24.420 --> 10:32.980
I the it's not me I have a close family member who often indulges in the eggnog a bit too much

10:32.980 --> 10:40.180
during the candle nights it could be me it's not but it could be this often results in wackiness

10:40.180 --> 10:48.820
followed by awkwardness then sadness like a clown like a clown Travis yes how do you deal with the

10:48.820 --> 10:55.140
deal with the awkward situation of someone drinking a bit too much during the holidays

10:55.140 --> 11:03.860
fun starter super fun opener for our comedy holiday podcast designated driver in dirty jersey

11:04.740 --> 11:13.060
are you here perfect no cool lol um you know when you think someone is drinking too much at a holiday

11:13.060 --> 11:19.700
party what you really have on your hands is a question of perspective because you're not

11:19.700 --> 11:30.660
drinking enough unless you are as you literally just said 20 seconds ago the designated driver

11:30.660 --> 11:35.460
that that was for either that was just a little bit any other episode any other episode would

11:35.460 --> 11:41.060
have put a swear word in there but i didn't because it's candle you you you guys are missing

11:41.060 --> 11:47.700
the best part of this situation what's that so the hardest thing about candle nights is not knowing

11:47.700 --> 11:55.780
what to get someone right right right i guess yeah there's a lot of rituals it's a made-up fake

11:55.780 --> 12:02.020
holiday i guess that's the hardest part get someone ever but what i'm saying is this provides

12:02.020 --> 12:09.620

elves and i say that some are human sized like legolas she doesn't believe me okay

14:30.980 --> 14:37.700

14:37.700 --> 14:44.340
different there are different phylum of elves but there are elves that are both keyboard elves

14:44.340 --> 14:50.740

15:29.220 --> 15:36.260
different uh sheen on the children's movies when kids get whisked away magically to the north pole

15:49.700 --> 15:55.380
block of wood and a hammer that's about the best i can do um those are two tools i have

15:55.380 --> 16:01.140
can i make it something with that maybe maybe they're partners and you need the kevlar owls

16:01.140 --> 16:06.180
to do the little detail the two hickeys okay legolas is do the body work yeah they do like

16:06.180 --> 16:11.620
the the big parts they build the case and then the camera and everyone like every elf is assigned his

16:11.620 --> 16:19.540
buddy elf oh my god and if one dies the other one has to kill themselves exactly it's a life bond

16:19.540 --> 16:26.500
between a big alpha to the north bowl i just also i need you to sign this this death don't

16:26.500 --> 16:34.020
pay attention to the fine print we've had some staffing issues lately the kevlar elves lifespan

16:34.020 --> 16:44.340
is 15 years and the legless is 85 so what i'm saying is i guess live it up i'm santa

16:44.340 --> 16:54.660
how many hr issues that's why he leaves christmas eve is the one night a year santa just can't take

16:54.660 --> 17:01.940

17:10.900 --> 17:20.020
so many legs i gotta get out of the house it's christmas eve the cookies will make me forget

17:20.020 --> 17:25.540
about the terrible system elizabeth town was such a bad movie for him to go out on

17:27.220 --> 17:31.300
that movie was garbage how many hr violations do you think you'd run into

17:31.300 --> 17:37.860
at an all orlando bloom work facility because i would i would discover that magic kingdom i

17:37.860 --> 17:43.620
would just roll and run through just pinching cheeks like that like their cheeks

17:45.380 --> 17:49.220
but then i hit a i hit a kevlar elf and i'd be like snap and i break his neck no

17:50.100 --> 17:52.420
and then you have to kill and then you have to kill the bloom

17:54.580 --> 18:03.940
for balance um and that's elf on the shelf too and that's the plot of elf on the shelf too god

18:03.940 --> 18:06.980
justin i just realized you're not wearing an undershirt either you've got a lot of looks

18:06.980 --> 18:12.340
going on travis you look great too but no uh do you want to read another question

18:12.340 --> 18:16.100
our extended family holiday gatherings are the usual affair

18:18.580 --> 18:25.780
christmas after stuffing ourselves on massive masses of food our sweet nana

18:26.340 --> 18:34.420
has forced an extensive carol sing into a tradition needless to say everyone hates it

18:34.420 --> 18:42.100
but even worse hang in there even worse is the fact that she just sits there refusing to sing

18:43.300 --> 18:50.980
while silently judging our worth as her progeny based on how the third how into the third verse

18:50.980 --> 18:58.660
of good king winseless we are how do we get out of this without poisoning the mashed potatoes

18:58.660 --> 19:07.220
it's a dark turn at the end musically morose in ontario canada okay i didn't realize that was a

19:07.220 --> 19:13.220
method of murder i thought that was like a fun idiom like uh oh i really poisoned the mashed

19:13.220 --> 19:19.460
potatoes this time huh you thought the canadians just had completely different idioms from us

19:19.460 --> 19:24.020
man i'm sorry you guys i tried to get it done on time but i really played my grandma on that one

19:24.020 --> 19:31.220
uh i'm just imagining this like emperor palpatine-esque figure just like sitting on a

19:31.220 --> 19:42.100
throne just like yes yes this pleases me my puppets of flesh really hit the high sea skylar

19:42.100 --> 19:47.540
sing to nana my angels of music angela sing for me

19:47.540 --> 19:57.300
sorry what is this character it's it's the nana i thought that was clear from context

19:57.860 --> 20:06.180
i just wanted to hear you say it's the nana um i want you to own it oh god i don't i'm just

20:06.180 --> 20:09.140
gonna pretend that this isn't an actual thing that happens in the world because it makes me

20:09.140 --> 20:14.740
so uncomfortable thinking about it is it possible wait maybe nana doesn't tell you where she is in

20:14.740 --> 20:21.220
the room and it's like elf on the shelf you have to find your nana and she's spying on you somewhere

20:21.220 --> 20:25.060
watching you sing and you don't know where she's in the cabinet like the baba duke

20:27.220 --> 20:32.340
is your grandma baba duke we didn't even consider the possible duke no

20:34.980 --> 20:40.260
is it possible that that your nana knows how much you all hate it but you all piss her off

20:40.260 --> 20:49.700
so much it's like i i'm old sing the song again did oh oh he stopped it he stopped he stopped

20:49.700 --> 20:55.140
that was good but you have to play it out like a different word that's the game you didgeridoo

20:55.140 --> 21:02.020
okay that's good that's pretty good so hard we should set up a swear jar where if we swear

21:02.660 --> 21:07.700
we have to put fifty thousand dollars into like a savings account and the first one of us that dies

21:07.700 --> 21:14.420
dies gets it no hold on for every one of us that dies you put another fifty thousand in

21:14.420 --> 21:21.540

it over we're not going to do this forever yahoo paging mister oh cool great this mystery yahoo

22:54.100 --> 23:03.460
user asked grandma got run over by a reindeer seriously by the way my super smooth transition

23:03.460 --> 23:10.500
went right in the toilet um do you think this song is disrespectful to grandmothers

23:10.500 --> 23:16.740
or just or just a nonsensical song simply meant to make people laugh

23:19.620 --> 23:24.420
why do you think the author chose grandma instead of grandpa or any other person

23:26.980 --> 23:30.900
would you play or sing this song in your grandma's company

23:30.900 --> 23:35.380
in case you've never heard all the lyrics because everyone's always laughing

23:35.380 --> 23:43.060
are they though throughout the entire duration of the number grandma got

23:46.980 --> 23:47.860
okay i can't hear it

23:51.700 --> 23:58.740
is she okay okay i need to know the backstory to enjoy the song show of applause who unironically

23:58.740 --> 24:06.740
has ever laughed at grandma got run over by a reindeer exactly no come on that was even

24:06.740 --> 24:15.620
ironic i heard it like yeah i don't want to leave him hanging sure uh god i think my favorite part

24:15.620 --> 24:20.820
of this question is the idea of it being disrespectful to the nana and that idea of

24:20.820 --> 24:33.300
like it comes on the radio or your playlist you're like oh oh god she's watching you're out of the

24:33.300 --> 24:42.660
wheel it's too late it's too late i don't know why i have my hands like nosferatu there arnani

24:42.660 --> 24:53.460
is not a nosferatu arnani is a lovely woman arnani is here is arnani here she's right there

24:54.420 --> 24:59.780
nani now are you cool with this jam raise your hand if grandma got run over by a reindeer offends

24:59.780 --> 25:10.820
you on a spiritual level no she's cool by the way friends hi it's justin mcroy i'm a third of the

25:10.820 --> 25:16.660
podcast of my brother my brother and me uh if you ever want to really amp up the difficulty

25:16.660 --> 25:23.540
of your life record a podcast for four years where you talk about basically the most horrible

25:23.540 --> 25:29.540
things you can imagine that you can't imagine i think it comes to us from another realm then

25:29.540 --> 25:39.780
do a christmas show in your hometown full of people then drink not a considerable amount

25:39.780 --> 25:52.580
of whiskey backstage then put your nani in the second row best of luck no pressure no pressure

25:54.020 --> 25:57.300
does the grandma die and grandma get run over by a reindeer

25:58.740 --> 26:04.740
is anyone familiar hold on i'll ask and then went through extensive physical therapy

26:04.740 --> 26:10.900
see every bone every bone from this point down was shattered does anybody know the

26:10.900 --> 26:18.020
song better than me is she learned a new lease on life and chose to leave her family she got

26:18.020 --> 26:24.180
another fitness membership and she looks great because she put in the work she's really doing it

26:24.180 --> 26:30.340

26:30.340 --> 26:36.820

i watched because i watch a lot of cartoons now new baby uh and this is you're showing your new

26:42.500 --> 26:47.780
baby a cartoon based on grandma got run over by a reindeer it was does she know about death yet

26:47.780 --> 26:50.980
this is how you're introducing the concept of death she doesn't die we already established

26:50.980 --> 26:58.180
she doesn't die but in this one santa finds yeah santa finds her and she has amnesia

26:58.180 --> 27:06.100
amnesia and he takes her back to the north pole and she becomes mrs claus what take that grandpa

27:07.380 --> 27:10.260
burn what santa stole your girl

27:12.580 --> 27:19.140
santa stole your girl grandpa that's your back old man santa's clumping up on you

27:20.980 --> 27:24.180
part of this job is to gotta treat her right

27:24.180 --> 27:30.100
hey listen that jingle bell behind you always nipping at your heel grandpa

27:30.820 --> 27:34.500
big fat man coming up with a bowl full of jelly gonna steal your girl

27:35.860 --> 27:45.300
it's me look up the chimney i got your woman i i made my reindeers run over i take your girl

grandma kissing santa claus and then leaving with him and i never saw her again uh we have

27:57.780 --> 28:03.540
literally just described a big part of this job is she's not like me she's gonna come a lot more

28:03.540 --> 28:16.900
than once a year you know what's up santa look up your chimney i got your girl it's me santa

28:16.900 --> 28:25.460
i'm done a big part of this job ho ho ho is to come up with like allegories and illusions

28:25.460 --> 28:29.620
that's basically the subtitle of the show um this is not one of them

28:29.620 --> 28:33.380
that is literally and exactly the plot of misery

28:35.460 --> 28:42.260
i was gonna say overboard no it's misery it's misery for sure y'all uh that is literally the

28:42.260 --> 28:47.300
bottom mystery was we just did yahoo let's get a general question we're gonna dip in

28:47.300 --> 28:52.500
to well we're gonna have to fix the mic because our dad broke it with his good with his hilarious

28:52.500 --> 28:58.660
goof was it worth it dad i think it was uh but we are gonna have some questions from the audience

28:58.660 --> 29:03.620
just a few uh because you guys are very far away from us and we maybe didn't think about that

29:03.620 --> 29:11.060
beforehand so start thinking about not a bummer holiday themed holiday themed without swearing

29:11.060 --> 29:19.460
i swear to god that's okay we can take the word okay um that if anyone breaks our streak up if

29:19.460 --> 29:28.180
we get a baba booey up here i will lose my mind because we've traveled back in time baba boo is

29:28.180 --> 29:35.700
still a super hot cultural reference justin bring me a hot cue off that list uh we're on the third

29:35.700 --> 29:42.100
one ahem ahem whiskey's catching up with papa for the past five years a friend and i would

29:42.100 --> 29:47.380
exchange gifts for no no it's not funny you goofed on it i meant the real third one with

29:47.380 --> 29:52.900
the star next to it that we use that was our clever code to say these are good questions

29:55.700 --> 30:01.060
did you see the star and you're like wonder what that means oh well how did that get there

30:01.060 --> 30:07.460
uh this face paint is so hot it's like i have 15 extra layers of skin on my face

30:08.340 --> 30:13.460
what you don't know is it's lead based oh great read the question justin right last christmas

30:14.260 --> 30:20.980
um i come from a multi-faith family so we celebrate christmas and hanukkah there's

30:20.980 --> 30:25.460
a name for that it's christmica uh what is the best way to fit candle nights in our

30:25.460 --> 30:32.900
already packed holiday schedule that's from dreidels and donner in dallas i think that

30:32.900 --> 30:40.900
candle nights solves i mean candle night solves a lot of problems just like worldwide but eventually

30:40.900 --> 30:51.140
it will eat both christmas and hanukkah for nourishment and will keep growing and pretty

30:51.140 --> 30:56.340
soon it's going to be the only game in town and if you think he's being figurative then you do

30:56.340 --> 31:02.420
know you don't understand candle the physiology of candle nights the old one that is candle nights

31:03.300 --> 31:10.900
the elder god that is that we have to feed lesser holidays to that's why we appease him to last

31:10.900 --> 31:15.540
another millennium that is why mayor steve williams came up with my brother my brother and me day

31:15.540 --> 31:24.420
it was not to honor us it was to keep him asleep dark unnamed uh uh far far below the mantle of

31:24.420 --> 31:31.780
the earth uh another quick candle night snow as you know candle nights is a pan-religious pansexual

31:31.780 --> 31:40.180
personal pan holiday uh that we made up for ourselves so everybody could have a party together

31:40.180 --> 31:47.780
uh we know we have a lot of christmas imagery on stage that is not no tiny ten was jewish

31:47.780 --> 31:56.340
fair enough fine that's not for lack of trying griffin and i scoured every store in the tri-state

31:56.340 --> 32:07.060
area that was we went to the target we went to the target at mary creek and i tell you it's

32:07.060 --> 32:10.420
ironically for god's chosen people you don't have a lot of selection

32:11.460 --> 32:18.500
that i didn't see a single uh menorah or any sort of hanukkah decoration i should have grabbed it

32:18.500 --> 32:25.380
while i was in cincinnati we were at a cvs and saw a kid this story is about the time you saw a

32:25.380 --> 32:33.940
menorah i'm going to lose it no we saw can you believe it no um where do they get off what no

32:33.940 --> 32:40.900
we saw a kit for a hanukkah house which is a gingerbread house can they not just accept the

32:40.900 --> 32:48.900
icing is blue and white terrific nice try gingerbread house empire wait uh what was the

32:48.900 --> 32:53.780

i just settled our belch for a long winter squeegee went out on the flugelhorn there

43:23.860 --> 43:29.540
arose such a jack and ape i sprang from my jello to see what was the matter away to the

43:29.540 --> 43:35.700
embryo i flew like a skeet to robin the chattanoogan and threw open the mcluster

43:37.220 --> 43:43.700
when what's my wondering razzle dazzle did appear but a miniature griffin an eight tiny georgeman

43:45.540 --> 43:49.780
with a little old one huh with a little old wormy so lively and quick

43:50.340 --> 43:52.820
i knew in a moment he must be saint moist

43:52.820 --> 44:03.220
stop it now zebra now humdrum now astral on chrysanthemum on reiterate on capitulate

44:03.220 --> 44:08.100
how much should we charge for tickets do you remember too much he was dressed all in pumpernickel

44:08.100 --> 44:13.700
from his head to his foot and his pianist were all tarnished with ashes ashes and soot

44:14.340 --> 44:21.140
his farts how they twinkled oh my god his teflon how merry his cheeks were like constantinople

44:21.140 --> 44:28.500
oh his nose like a scrumdiddlyumptious he was chubby and plump a right jolly old smackdown

44:29.060 --> 44:34.260
and i puked when i saw him in spite of myself and i and laying his molly

44:34.260 --> 44:40.500
is it the whole thing and laying his molly molly coddle aside of his front butt

44:40.500 --> 44:50.180
from but twice good work job ward smiths and giving in i'm so sorry up the dead travis he rose

44:51.300 --> 44:54.580
but i heard him exclaim erie drove out of sight

44:55.140 --> 45:01.060
merry candlelight to all and to all a good worst thing that happens in the podcast

45:01.060 --> 45:14.020
thank you all thank you all for sitting through the last sad libs ever and now it's canonical

45:15.860 --> 45:22.900
how long have you been going like three years a lot of people do the this isn't funny but

45:22.900 --> 45:28.180
we're doing it anyway but not a lot of people have the strength of will to commit

45:28.180 --> 45:34.660
to really not making it funny we're not it's not a goof it's really not in any way entertaining

45:34.660 --> 45:40.580
griffin and i are joking for the poetry yeah you yeah uh maybe if we do a few

45:40.580 --> 45:44.500
more huntington live shows they'll name you like poet laureate of huntington west virginia

45:45.700 --> 45:49.780
uh i got a yadru for everybody if you're into that

45:49.780 --> 45:58.740
yeah this yadru mystery nights was sent in by drew davenport thank you level 8000

45:59.300 --> 46:06.180
yadru shaman drew davenport it's asked by yahoo answers i forgot i can't see

46:06.180 --> 46:09.620
that data because i am not connected to the website

46:09.620 --> 46:30.260
it's just craig question mark craig craig craig asked if you gave people your greatest gift

46:31.540 --> 46:34.180
what would that be i just did no

46:34.180 --> 46:41.940
oh you better hope you didn't it's all i've got

46:44.660 --> 46:52.740
my best gift then in that in that context would be a a sharp editor's eye a keen eye on the uh

46:52.740 --> 46:58.820
the old audacity track uh god my greatest gift that's my greatest gift i would probably make

46:58.820 --> 47:04.500
them french toast i'm pretty baller at that you make a nice french toast i would say probably

47:05.620 --> 47:10.820
tender kisses anything special about them or just like that's all over

47:12.820 --> 47:20.260
my greatest gift would be for me to film travis giving you the kisses because you want to you

47:20.260 --> 47:26.180
want to remember it goes by so quickly i mean it takes 14 minutes but it seems like i would upload

47:26.180 --> 47:33.780
them into iMovie i would use that one that looks like a map opening up and i would put some music

47:33.780 --> 47:37.780
underneath it something real nice some five for fighting some superman by five for friends

47:40.500 --> 47:44.420
that's what we need to kiss them for three minutes and five seconds which is the runtime

47:44.420 --> 47:50.500
of superman by five for fighting and i'll tell you all someday why i know that information well

47:50.500 --> 47:58.020
it's gonna work because when i kiss people um i do it like one might apply um uh glue stick

47:58.020 --> 48:04.020
and i see their own body who does that i push on and then maintain the same pressure and then

48:04.020 --> 48:09.700
just you maintain contact around like a slug it feels like a slug it's like that clean your

48:09.700 --> 48:15.220
fish thing for you right remora remora i believe is what those are called you're a doctor fish is

48:15.220 --> 48:20.660
what you're saying did you just point to your wife like tell them about the great kisses i give you

48:20.660 --> 48:26.100
you want to come on stage and talk about my precious kisses five out of five would kiss again

48:26.100 --> 48:34.900
yeah okay well can i uh can i get sidebar real quick super quick sidebar sure uh i know the bit

48:34.900 --> 48:39.140
that we talked about was that we wouldn't see scanner santa when he came out to put the thing

48:39.140 --> 48:46.500
in the booth oh okay listen listen i accidentally looked to the left because i was like where is he

48:47.380 --> 48:53.540
and because i thought he wasn't out yet and i saw him and it scared the hell out of me

48:54.820 --> 49:01.940
i you may have noticed a moment where i seem suddenly terrified for an instant imagine you're

49:01.940 --> 49:09.140
just like doing your podcast here and then you adjust like pan left and there's a santa who's

49:09.140 --> 49:14.020
just been there the whole time it was really really scary can i ask you a question i'm still

49:14.020 --> 49:18.740
trying to get over it can i ask you a question hit me have you seen sydney since we started

49:20.340 --> 49:23.300

49:41.380 --> 49:47.700

49:52.740 --> 49:57.860
then we're gonna do an audience question have one ready and be ready to hustle because you've got

49:57.860 --> 50:02.660
to make it you literally need to run don't no don't like stamp don't rush up here just raise

50:02.660 --> 50:11.700

ben when you feel the wind rushing through your hair at 15 miles an hour

59:42.260 --> 59:45.940
do you think when you're getting somewhere moderately faster than logging

59:45.940 --> 59:53.780
when you see when you see a recovering grandma uh jogging past you do you think that their

59:53.780 --> 59:59.700
their jives their jabs are gonna their japes are gonna penetrate your psyche they're not

59:59.700 --> 01:00:03.460

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:12.100
ben real talk if i may ignore everyone else who okay can i use the bathroom yeah here's the deal

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:17.620
ben what that is is you found a thing that makes you happy and that you enjoy and for whatever

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:24.260
reason there are people in your life that look at something that you to take unashamed happiness in

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:32.020
and they don't feel that and so they mock it and they won't accept the fact that you are

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:38.660
third like you are unironically unashamed of how much you love do you ironically ride the moped

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:47.220

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:59.940
joke to make well okay keep going we were getting serious for a second it's not mockery it's it's a

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:11.620
serious um they're worried about you yeah he's too he's too real we lost him uh uh is it dangerous

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:17.540

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:24.660
back i'm going to shift to the other side of i also think it's possible to begin to love something

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:29.940
too much and that becomes like your defining feature are you moped dude you're not wearing

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.860
moped attire i don't think you do have a hole in your jeans is that from a wicked accident

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:40.980
you just spin out on 60 going 15 every time anything gets brought up you somehow compare

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:46.260
it to mopeds and you're like oh yeah who wants to go on dinner speaking of going out

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:52.980

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:15.780
the scribblings of a crazy person we they're all adventure zone notes it's like it's like

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:22.100
train robbery goblins sure why not please finish your question we are the rudest human beings on

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:29.140
the planet but it is my bim bam day so what's up so we don't have christmas eve plans we were

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:34.420
invited to like a sort of christmas orphan non like for the jews and muslims sure yeah

01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:41.780
um the question is so he's got like a nostalgic attachment to christmas eve but we don't have

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:47.380
christmas eve family plans you don't have the trappings exactly okay so should we go to this

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:53.540
non-christmassy party for folks who aren't visiting their family or should we spend

01:06:53.540 --> 01:07:00.260
christmas eve just the two of us and our cats how many cats are they cool oh two yeah no they're

01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:05.620
super cool okay well that's a horse of different color which is ironic because that was the line

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:10.820
that justin said is lord growly oh my god you're right wizard of oz anyway to answer the question

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:17.300
that the person directly in front of us just asked uh oof um man that's gonna be hard because

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:23.780
your your your boyfriend is gonna roll up like time to knit a stocking for everyone

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:27.540
because that's what i've done my whole time on this planet is your boyfriend here

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:35.220
yeah he's over there so hey hey uh here's what you guys have got and it's it's it's a really

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:42.500
great opportunity to now just do whatever you want and then let it shake out what becomes a

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:48.020
new tradition right you can really like wheat and chaff this and say like we're gonna do these ten

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:53.300
things i liked four of them we'll keep those four and the other six we don't have to deal with that's

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:57.780
a problem how many traditions do you think have been started by people doing something once and

01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:02.500
they hated it but no one wanted to admit it to anybody else they've been doing it for 10 years

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.100
and then the next year they're like we need to sing in front of nana again right we gotta sing

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:10.580
in front of nana i guess are we gonna have time for our annual dear zachary they're going they're

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:17.380
not gonna sing in front of me again oh god they're so bad so bad i don't even want to sing with them

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:23.460
uh yeah i mean you guys can make your own traditions now and that's a very special

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:30.980
process but i totally get wanting to that was my leaking i'm about to disagree that's my noise

01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:35.140
i'm about to disagree i think it's better to be with a bunch of people to be fun oh yeah yeah no

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:38.660
i'm not saying to be alone i'm saying make the traditions with other people boyfriend

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:47.540
and your official title boyfriend thing you craig craig you can enforce your traditions

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:54.420
because wow you're really putting craig on blast right now i love you but if you what did craig

01:08:54.420 --> 01:09:02.180
do to deserve this listen here you jerk word and that's the best i could do but in all honestly

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:07.860
like if you try to recreate those traditions like you can do them but you can't expect

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:13.540
the same results as it was when you were i don't know i don't know what went travis transitioned

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:21.860
like guy at 2 a.m and you're both really drunk and he's like no no you listen to me sit down

01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:30.820
it's my turn laid back in the bean bag it's mbnbm okay all i'm saying is that it's the

01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:35.860
expectation game of you can roll up and do your tradition and relive that experience but it's with

01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:40.980
a new set of people in new variables and it will be different and inherently the tradition will

01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:45.860
alter because you have new people is the tradition could there be a tradition that you're maintaining

01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:53.860
that's something awesome already like oh my whole life on christmas eve i get turnt i get turnt

01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:59.220
let's go to a party it's like what do you do craig what's his name can you just tanner tanner

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:05.780
okay i'm gonna stick with craig stick with craig um what do you do what do you do craig he's like oh

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:13.780
i get oh i get totally totally turnt and they're like yeah sure and then you all do it together

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:18.820
that's how traditions get born this year for thanksgiving i went and hung out we went i just

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:23.300

01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:28.580
but my parents insist i help this year i tried to hang out in the same room reading

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:35.940
a book while they decorated hiding from christmas they were not having it and forced me to help

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:42.340

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:10.740
at decorating a christmas tree it's litter are you putting everything decoration up and it's

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:14.340
six inches away from the tree and they just drop it on the ground they're putting everything on

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:19.460
one branch it's like a beautiful christmas horn steve you just put them in your beard again aw

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:24.900
steve you ate the popcorn garland and then you just kept eating ornaments right off the tree

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:30.900
like some sort of giraffe also i want to say this i love that you said okay i'm bad at it i don't

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:38.340
like it so this year i hung out in the same room thumbs up and read a book thumbs down was the book

01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:47.300
how to be good at basic human tasks like putting baubles on branches could you at least watch the

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:53.060
baubles being put on the branch say good job you see it you see it good job good good bubble

01:12:53.060 --> 01:13:00.180
placement nana here's the learning curve for baubles on branches once one time and you got

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:06.420
the logistics of it down you hung them on the wrong tree you went next door you broke into

01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:11.540
the house next door and put it on their tree how are you so bad at this why are you a cat

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:16.420
