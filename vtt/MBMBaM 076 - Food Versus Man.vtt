00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.240
Welcome, my brother, my brother, me. We're this week, we're, we just want to say we're sorry.

00:49.040 --> 00:54.320
We want to kick off by making some corrections and some apologies.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.680
And some retractions.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.640
And some retractions.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.560
Patently untrue stuff.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.520
Patently untrue things. I should say, this is my brother,

01:01.520 --> 01:03.600
my brother, me and the advice show from the modern era.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.200
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.040
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.800
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.840
And Benjamin Franklin, guys, wasn't a president.

01:11.840 --> 01:12.800
Nope, he was king.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.120
Apparently we said that in the last episode. He was king.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.880
Okay, see, I said that, but I said it as a goof.

01:18.880 --> 01:23.440
And I thought you guys would be like, that's Jay goofing again, and you call me on it.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.440
But no dice, he just let it slide.

01:25.440 --> 01:31.120
And I didn't want to go back. I didn't want to pick up the trail and say, hey, hey.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.520
This thing I just said was a joke.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.560
Remember that thing?

01:34.560 --> 01:37.840
Let's, let's move on to the other big thing, which is Ewan McGregor.

01:37.840 --> 01:40.080
He wasn't in Contagion, was he?

01:40.080 --> 01:41.040
That was on us.

01:41.040 --> 01:44.080
That was, that one, that's, that was Paul Rudd.

01:44.960 --> 01:45.600
Yep.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.040
No, that was, who's the other guy?

01:48.160 --> 01:48.640
Evan McGregor.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.600
Jude Law.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.360
Jude Law. That was Jude Law.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.520
And you know what? I apologize to Ewan McGregor.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.600
I don't apologize to Jude Law, because guess what?

01:55.600 --> 01:57.680
Got a really fucked up grill still.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.720
I'm sorry about Evan's grill.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.200
He's got a real jacked up tooth situation.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.080
I said last week that I cried during Katy Perry's firework.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.080
I just want to correct that.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.720
It was Lady Gaga's Born This Way.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.000
Oh my god, how can you cry during that song?

02:12.000 --> 02:12.560
No, it wasn't.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.200
How can you not just damn?

02:13.200 --> 02:15.200
No, it was a happy cry. It was just epic.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.880
Like, I was born this way as a full grown male.

02:18.880 --> 02:23.200
Well, speaking of Gaga, she's got a new track,

02:23.200 --> 02:24.880
sort of a country inspired joint.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.240
That's the weirdest shit.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.040
You and I.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.560
So here's the weird thing about it.

02:28.560 --> 02:32.400
The first 100 times I heard it, she sings about Nebraska.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.160
Last night, I had a little wine.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.200
I'm driving home.

02:37.200 --> 02:37.920
Uh oh.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.000
No, I mean, I'm not driving home.

02:40.000 --> 02:40.880
I'm sitting at home.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.640
And that song comes on the radio,

02:44.640 --> 02:47.360
except instead of Nebraska, she's talking about West Virginia.

02:48.160 --> 02:48.720
What?

02:48.720 --> 02:52.720
Are, has this song been localized in other states?

02:52.720 --> 02:54.000
Is this going on elsewhere?

02:54.000 --> 02:54.800
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.320
You're telling me that there is a

02:56.320 --> 02:58.240
fill in the blanks Lady Gaga song

02:58.240 --> 03:00.560
that radio stations can change?

03:00.560 --> 03:01.840
Yes, this is what I'm saying.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.840
Is it like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.120
West Virginia.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.560
And Jesus Christ.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.000
It's, yes.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.640
Like, West Virginia, West Virginia, I love you.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.440
Like that.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.760
I don't think this is going on in every state.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.600
It's a very country inspired song.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.040
I don't think she's somewhere like.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.200
You're saying she hit the fucking Bible Belt

03:19.200 --> 03:21.440
and then Nebraska also?

03:21.440 --> 03:23.040
Yeah, yeah, this is what I'm saying to you.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.520
That's the weirdest shit I've ever heard.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.360
If other people have heard this song,

03:27.360 --> 03:28.560
here's what scares me the most.

03:30.080 --> 03:35.440
There, maybe this like read geographically sensitive version.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.040
Maybe some people have only gotten that version.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.680
So there are people walking around right now thinking like,

03:41.680 --> 03:44.640
ah, Lady Gaga, she really gets North Dakota.

03:44.640 --> 03:48.000
You know, that same thing happened to John Denver

03:48.000 --> 03:49.840
and fill in the blank Mountain Mama.

03:49.840 --> 03:50.560
Yeah.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.840
That was a weird song.

03:51.840 --> 03:52.560
It sure was.

03:53.120 --> 03:53.760
Florida.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.440
It's New Jersey.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.320
Look at those moms.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.760
So the first version of the song you heard was Nebraska, right?

04:03.760 --> 04:04.080
Yes.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.000
And you heard that on the radio, I'm imagining.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.360
I'm guessing you didn't pick up the CD.

04:08.960 --> 04:09.920
Yeah, I didn't.

04:09.920 --> 04:15.600
Does the album have 51 tracks on it, including DC?

04:15.600 --> 04:16.960
Puerto Rico.

04:16.960 --> 04:18.480
District of Columbia.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.320
So you heard Nebraska on the radio.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.640
How fucking dumb is that radio DJ?

04:26.080 --> 04:28.240
How's that radio DJ like, where are we?

04:28.240 --> 04:30.640
Somebody comes running down the hall, knocks on the window.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.480
You played the Nebraska one.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.080
Just fuck it, play Nebraska.

04:34.080 --> 04:34.800
Close enough.

04:34.800 --> 04:35.760
So bad.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.120
I gotta hear this track.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.240
Yeah, you gotta track it down and see if it's...

04:40.240 --> 04:42.400
Yeah, I think if the original one is Nebraska,

04:42.400 --> 04:47.360
I just listened to the CD version that I have stored in my heart.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.480
And it is in fact, Nebraska.

04:50.480 --> 04:51.920
Hey, let's move on to the advice.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.680
My friend Kevin regularly drinks Smirnoff.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.040
My leg is bleeding.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.160
What's going on down there?

04:59.760 --> 05:01.920
My friend Kevin regularly drinks Smirnoff.

05:01.920 --> 05:02.800
Hold on, do you need a second?

05:03.920 --> 05:04.960
I mean, it's like...

05:04.960 --> 05:06.400
Did you stab yourself?

05:06.400 --> 05:08.160
No, it's just like, I think the skin,

05:08.720 --> 05:11.600
from where my muscles have stretched my calves.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.720
The skin jumped off.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.160
From being so diesel.

05:14.160 --> 05:15.600
It's like paper thin down there.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.920
It's like super muscly, but translucent.

05:17.920 --> 05:18.880
It's like popping a balloon.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.680
I look like someone on a Batman cartoon

05:21.680 --> 05:23.600
that's been coated with mutagenic ooze.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.600
Yeah, you'd be like Paperman, Tissue Man.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.040
Tissue Man.

05:27.040 --> 05:30.240
Tissue Man's so strong, but he's so vulnerable.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.120
But so tender.

05:31.120 --> 05:36.640
My friend Kevin regularly drinks Smirnoff ice and not alone,

05:36.640 --> 05:39.520
but in public and during social gatherings.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.720
We all try to tell him it makes him look creepy

05:42.720 --> 05:45.040
and like a pedophile, but all the laughs,

05:45.040 --> 05:48.160
he hasn't curtailed his efforts or shamed of his poor taste.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.320
I'm out of ideas for discouragement.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.600
He's an avid listener like me.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.280
Perhaps he will heed direct advice

05:53.280 --> 05:56.400
from our favorite brothers, Smirnoff in St. Louis.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.080
Did this person write into us so that we would shame Kevin

06:00.080 --> 06:01.840
into not drinking Smirnoff ice?

06:01.840 --> 06:02.640
Because we can do that.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.040
I'm going to pause it, though, just real quick.

06:06.080 --> 06:10.320
I think it's better that Kevin only drinks Smirnoff ice in public

06:10.320 --> 06:14.080
because if he were a secret Smirnoff ice alcoholic,

06:14.080 --> 06:16.320
that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

06:16.320 --> 06:17.280
Guys, it's 11 o'clock.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.480
I gotta go home and get smeared.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.400
If he's just like sitting at home in the dark,

06:22.400 --> 06:23.760
chugging Smirnoff ice.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.760
Hello, Kevin?

06:27.760 --> 06:30.080
Kevin, yeah, yeah.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.760
What are you doing right now, Kevin?

06:31.760 --> 06:32.320
Nothing.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.320
Don't worry, Kevin, you smell like sugar.

06:36.320 --> 06:39.520
Trust me, they've got this new cranberry fizzle spritz out

06:39.520 --> 06:40.720
and it's so good.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.840
I want to go out on a limb for Kev

06:43.840 --> 06:47.600
and say that if that was really his favorite drink

06:47.600 --> 06:50.080
and it just had a stigma attached to it,

06:50.080 --> 06:52.480
I don't think I don't buy a drink stigma.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.480
I think you should be able to drink whatever you want.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.960
But that drink has the most stigma on it, though.

06:56.960 --> 06:57.280
Yeah.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.000
No, Zima has the most stigma.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.560
But what I'm saying is that the problem I have with it

07:02.560 --> 07:04.320
is that there are many better drinks.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.400
Smirnoff ice is the grossest shit.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.840
It's just really gross.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.160
I don't understand being able to drink enough of them

07:10.160 --> 07:10.800
to get drunk.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.200
Yeah, because you get so much, you get tummy rot

07:13.200 --> 07:15.680
if you put too much, there's so much sugar.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.520
It's basically like you took a beer

07:17.520 --> 07:19.360
and then filled it with pixie sticks.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.200
Yeah, you just put a bunch of sprees in there

07:21.200 --> 07:22.080
and then all of a sudden-

07:22.080 --> 07:22.720
Disgusting.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.360
I'll never forget there was a time me and my friends in college,

07:25.360 --> 07:27.040
you know, we're hanging out watching a football game

07:27.040 --> 07:29.120
baseball game, some kind of sports event,

07:29.120 --> 07:31.600
and we had drank all the beer in the house

07:31.600 --> 07:34.560
and there were three Smirnoff ices left over from some girls

07:34.560 --> 07:36.320
that were there at the party the night before.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.920
And we're like, well, this is all that's left.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.680
And we each took one sip and vomited like right then.

07:41.680 --> 07:42.160
No, okay.

07:42.160 --> 07:42.720
Hold on.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.760
I don't think that's stop.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.880
Stop right there.

07:44.880 --> 07:45.760
Absolutely true.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.480
Did they maybe-

07:46.480 --> 07:48.880
Was it the new Ipecac flavored Smirnoff ice?

07:48.880 --> 07:51.280
It wasn't like an instant thing, but it's just-

07:51.280 --> 07:53.040
As soon as it crossed your lips, like, no.

07:53.040 --> 07:56.880
You and two friends were like, bros, let's do this.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.080
Clink bottles.

07:58.080 --> 08:01.440
Everyone lifts the cups at the same time to their mouths

08:01.440 --> 08:05.760
and it just suddenly the room is a soft film.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.400
It's just coated in vomit.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.280
I mean, more or less.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.600
That might be colored by the fact that we've been drinking all day,

08:11.600 --> 08:14.560
but I remember it clearly vomiting right away.

08:14.560 --> 08:19.840
You're saying that smear before beer never fear.

08:19.840 --> 08:24.640
Beer before smear throw up everywhere forever.

08:24.640 --> 08:25.200
Yeah.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.320
Get the fuck out of that room.

08:26.320 --> 08:26.880
Get out of the room.

08:26.880 --> 08:27.920
Stop drinking it.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.400
Like, there are many better things that you can enjoy.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.440
The thing is you can have a whiskey sour.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.000
You can have-

08:34.000 --> 08:34.640
Yeah.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.480
Like, there's so many-

08:37.200 --> 08:38.160
Start there.

08:38.160 --> 08:40.560
Yeah, start and then work your way up to like-

08:40.560 --> 08:45.040
Even those can rust out your insides like battery acid.

08:46.240 --> 08:46.960
You know what you should do?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.240
Like old fashions.

08:48.240 --> 08:48.640
Oh, no.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.640
I think this man wants a flavor sensation.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.880
If that's the case, I'm going to suggest a seven and seven.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.040
That is still my DOC to this day.

08:57.040 --> 09:02.800
Oh, what about a sweet tea vodka with a little bit of lemon?

09:02.800 --> 09:04.000
That shit is delicious.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.080
I just get a vodka gimlet like a boss.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.720
That goes down smooth every time.

09:08.720 --> 09:09.520
What about a-

09:09.520 --> 09:10.960
What about a tulip?

09:10.960 --> 09:11.840
Like, there's so many-

09:11.840 --> 09:12.160
A tulip?

09:12.160 --> 09:13.040
No one can make those.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.640
There's so many options for you.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.800
Straight up, don't order a tulip at a bar.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.160
It's the most annoying drink.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.440
It's like, hey, bartender.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.200
Get out that mortar and pestle.

09:21.200 --> 09:21.700
Yeah.

09:22.720 --> 09:23.360
I want to-

09:23.360 --> 09:24.400
I'm ready for a project.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.680
Let's get into a project together.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.160
It's like making an album together.

09:28.160 --> 09:28.880
Let's build a blanket.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.000
Well, we're looking for something.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.800
We, you know, project we work on together.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.240
So we decided to make this mint julep.

09:36.640 --> 09:37.440
I'm a girl.

09:37.440 --> 09:37.680
Okay.

09:39.760 --> 09:43.840
I've been dating a guy for a couple months and I really like him.

09:43.840 --> 09:46.640
But he's four years younger than me and it shows.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.840
I'm 24 and think of myself as a pretty laid back girlfriend.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.080
Definitely not one of these overbearing types.

09:52.080 --> 09:56.800
But anytime I try to have an adult conversation with him or ask him nicely to do something,

09:56.800 --> 10:00.720
his temper goes wild and he thinks I'm attacking his character.

10:01.280 --> 10:05.680
Even if it's something as small as, hey, could you please not walk in my flower beds?

10:05.680 --> 10:07.520
Or will you rinse your spaghetti bowl out?

10:09.280 --> 10:10.560
Spaghetti is a funny food.

10:11.440 --> 10:16.000
He always has to be right about everything and he gets his front hiney hurt if he isn't.

10:16.640 --> 10:19.920
Is this something he will grow out of or should I dump him?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.360
Temper troubles in Dallas.

10:21.360 --> 10:24.160
I don't think you're using that right.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.760
I don't like his dick.

10:25.760 --> 10:26.800
He gets his dick hurt.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.800
He gets dick hurt.

10:28.800 --> 10:32.560
How often is the problem arising of him walking in your flower beds?

10:33.360 --> 10:35.440
I feel like that should be like a one time problem.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.760
Hey, wait, are you dating a raccoon?

10:40.480 --> 10:44.080
So you're saying that what she should start doing is just spraying him with the hose when

10:44.080 --> 10:45.520
she gets in the flower bed, right?

10:45.520 --> 10:52.000
Hey, I'm just imagining some fucking bumpkin like wearing overalls and like stomping,

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
like marching in your flower bed while eating spaghetti and just like sloshing it around

10:56.000 --> 10:57.760
everywhere and he's whistling a tune.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.160
What an asshole.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.120
You know, I don't think this has anything to do with him being younger.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.680
I think maybe he's just kind of ill mannered.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.960
I don't know why she's suddenly dating Boo Radley, but there you go.

11:10.960 --> 11:14.960
I have to imagine you have a cement path leading from your stairs to the sidewalk.

11:14.960 --> 11:19.200
And does he just like does he take a fucking shortcut through the tulips?

11:19.200 --> 11:19.920
What's he doing?

11:22.320 --> 11:22.880
I don't.

11:25.040 --> 11:30.560
Far be it from me to to pass judgment on anyone's relationship or character.

11:30.560 --> 11:33.120
But that's what we do constantly on this show.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.120
Yeah, but this is a serious one.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.080
OK, should I break up with him or does he sound fixable to me?

11:39.680 --> 11:43.840
You have great taste in podcast, if nothing else.

11:43.840 --> 11:46.000
I you seem like a down girl.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.840
I would not stick around with this dude.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.680
He sounds he sounds like bad news.

11:49.680 --> 11:54.720
How I I think what it is is you always got to give them the opportunity to improve and

11:54.720 --> 11:55.360
she did.

11:55.360 --> 12:00.960
But I'm saying like cutthroat ultimatum say that, hey, I'm sick of, you know, every time

12:00.960 --> 12:03.120
I bring something up, you flying off the handle.

12:03.120 --> 12:07.120
So either cut it out or this isn't going to work out.

12:07.120 --> 12:12.080
Yeah, it's I think it's more of a problem that he gets angry when you say don't walk

12:12.080 --> 12:12.960
in the flower bed.

12:12.960 --> 12:16.640
Is he like, that's what I do in the flower bed whenever I want.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.000
I'm the flower bed guy.

12:18.000 --> 12:18.880
Yeah, that's my bit.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.760
I'm going to eat that spaghetti later.

12:21.760 --> 12:22.560
Like, no, you're not.

12:22.560 --> 12:23.360
It's in the sink.

12:23.920 --> 12:27.520
I have a pan on top of that bowl that had dirty eggs in it before.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.840
You're not going to eat your dirty egg spaghetti.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.120
So I say, yeah, call him out on it.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.040
Yeah, but like, I don't know.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.040
How much are you?

12:37.040 --> 12:44.240
How much are you in a relationship, how much are you sort of required to clean out your

12:44.240 --> 12:45.760
fucking spaghetti bowls?

12:46.400 --> 12:50.480
No, deal with somebody who, you know, doesn't have their shit together.

12:50.480 --> 12:55.760
I think that it is there somewhere is an equation of like an inverse property of like the amount

12:55.760 --> 12:57.840
you you actually care about them.

12:57.840 --> 13:02.160
The strength of your feelings for them is the amount of time you're willing to invest

13:02.160 --> 13:03.520
into making it work.

13:03.520 --> 13:03.920
Yeah.

13:03.920 --> 13:09.040
And I'm not at all disparaging your feelings towards this person, but at some point the

13:09.040 --> 13:11.440
balance shifts and you go, you know what?

13:12.080 --> 13:15.440
Now I'm just fucking fed up with it and I put too much work into this and I'm out.

13:15.440 --> 13:16.000
You know what?

13:16.000 --> 13:20.320
The reason he's so he gets so quick tempered about these things is because you're older

13:20.320 --> 13:24.480
than him and he has sort of an inferiority thing going for him about that.

13:24.480 --> 13:29.520
And so when you call him out for things like that, it's sort of you may not be meaning

13:29.520 --> 13:32.720
to, but you sort of asserting your age over him.

13:32.720 --> 13:37.440
And but I'm going to say this, though, if if he cares about you and you ask him to do

13:37.440 --> 13:42.800
these seemingly simple things and he refuses to do them, he might not care about you in

13:42.800 --> 13:46.000
the same way you care about him or he might not know what it means to care.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.880
Because if you're saying, like, rinse out your bowl and he goes, doesn't go, OK, sweetie,

13:48.880 --> 13:49.680
don't worry about it.

13:49.680 --> 13:50.240
I got that.

13:51.120 --> 13:56.080
Like, yeah, I think that a good compromise, maybe if you don't want to ditch the relationship

13:56.080 --> 13:58.880
entirely, maybe don't live together.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.240
I mean, if you're does it sound like they're living together now?

14:02.240 --> 14:03.760
No, no, no, no.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.560
Why is he eating spaghetti over at your place?

14:06.560 --> 14:08.400
Go home and eat spaghetti.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.240
Yeah, don't eat that here.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.760
I got to say, a couple of months is not long enough for you to make the spaghetti jump.

14:14.480 --> 14:18.240
No, no, you should not be cooking spaghetti for him at that point.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.120
That's a sin.

14:19.840 --> 14:20.640
It's a sin.

14:20.640 --> 14:24.000
So I would just let him know that it's not that you're trying to change who he is or

14:24.000 --> 14:24.480
anything.

14:24.480 --> 14:28.160
You're just saying, hey, these are things that are kind of bugging me.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.440
And if we want this to work out, I would really like it if you would, you know.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.280
I think treat my shit better.

14:33.280 --> 14:38.800
I think the definition of maturity in relationships is when you get to the point where you realize

14:38.800 --> 14:43.040
that the whole point of being in one is so that someone can tell you how to live your

14:43.040 --> 14:43.540
life.

14:44.640 --> 14:48.000
I got to that point where I don't know what I'm doing.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.800
Maybe someone else has it figured out.

14:50.800 --> 14:54.800
Because every so often Teresa will tell me something like, you know, you should hang

14:54.800 --> 14:56.880
up your towel before you throw it in the dirty clothes.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.320
And I'm like, wait, but it's dirty.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.240
And she's like, yeah, but let it dry out and then it won't mildew.

15:00.240 --> 15:04.960
And I'm like, it's like I've just learned some kind of, you know, like mathematical

15:06.000 --> 15:07.360
property about the stars.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.160
It's amazing.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.600
Thank you for making me better.

15:09.600 --> 15:14.720
How pants on head stupid do you have to be to walk through a flower bed?

15:14.720 --> 15:19.280
Like that's like that's like the tantamount to like walking through a sandbox full of

15:19.280 --> 15:19.920
light bulbs.

15:19.920 --> 15:20.800
Like you don't do that.

15:20.800 --> 15:21.680
They're delicate things.

15:21.680 --> 15:22.960
It's something a five year old.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.560
It's something that a toddler does.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.280
A toddler.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.760
Are you dating a toddler?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.280
Are you dating a Chandler?

15:30.800 --> 15:31.280
Cut him loose.

15:31.280 --> 15:31.920
He's too tiny.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.560
Let that salmon grow and then harvest him.

15:35.120 --> 15:38.240
Chandler, I will smack that smirk right off of your face.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.760
Clean that spaghetti out.

15:42.080 --> 15:46.080
Chandler come get your spaghetti ball you left in the flowers again, you pumpkin.

15:46.080 --> 15:46.800
You're goofy.

15:47.440 --> 15:48.400
You're a big goof.

15:48.400 --> 15:48.960
I love you.

15:48.960 --> 15:49.440
I'm sorry.

15:49.440 --> 15:50.000
I love you.

15:50.000 --> 15:50.960
Hey, Yahoo Answers.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.240
Yeah.

15:52.240 --> 15:52.800
This one.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.320
So we learned it.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.120
This one was sent in by Galiayali.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.160
Thank you, Gali.

15:58.160 --> 16:05.360
It's by Yahoo Answers user Marco, who asks girlfriend wants a lock of hair.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.160
Where to get one?

16:07.920 --> 16:10.800
I need a birthday gift for my girlfriend by January.

16:10.800 --> 16:15.760
And she says that she will dump me if I can't find her a lock of Justin Bieber hair.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.960
It costs $40,000 at auction.

16:18.960 --> 16:23.360
And my only option to get a lock of the gold hair is to get a lock of the gold hair.

16:23.360 --> 16:32.560
Is either to steal it from a museum, cut it off Justin Bieber, also risking serious legal

16:32.560 --> 16:33.060
trouble.

16:33.760 --> 16:38.560
Is there any way I can acquire that golden hair so that I can appease my girlfriend so

16:38.560 --> 16:39.360
she doesn't dump me?

16:40.320 --> 16:50.400
How about cut it off a Yorkshire Terrier and then say this is genuine Bieber fur or cut

16:50.400 --> 16:53.680
off some of genuine's hair. What's he doing?

16:58.480 --> 17:03.040
I was almost about to create another retraction for us where I would name an R&B song that

17:03.040 --> 17:05.360
I'm positive genuine didn't sing.

17:05.360 --> 17:06.000
Yeah.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.200
And then we have a whole other situation on our hands.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.160
What about this?

17:10.160 --> 17:11.120
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.320
I thought you said Justin Long.

17:12.320 --> 17:19.520
This is embarrassing. You're a PC and I'm embarrassed.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.320
I think she's going to know, right?

17:22.320 --> 17:24.960
She's going to know if you try to pull a fakie on her.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.480
You got to get the real deal.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.760
She knows what his hair smells like.

17:29.760 --> 17:30.480
How can you?

17:30.480 --> 17:37.520
I just watched a few weeks back the documentary Never Say Never, which no joke is a goddamn

17:37.520 --> 17:38.240
revelation.

17:38.240 --> 17:43.040
If you haven't seen it, Netflix it, do whatever you need to do to get your eyes on this movie

17:43.040 --> 17:48.160
because it will make you look at this young ingenue in a whole new light.

17:48.160 --> 17:52.560
But how do we get that hair off that sweet head?

17:53.280 --> 17:54.400
Maybe just ask him.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.120
I'm sorry. Wait a minute.

17:55.120 --> 18:01.280
Did you was there a point of that digression other than you wanting to pimp Justin Bieber's

18:01.280 --> 18:02.320
movies on our show?

18:02.320 --> 18:03.920
I mean, I saw I saw.

18:03.920 --> 18:04.960
You should check this shit.

18:04.960 --> 18:05.760
This is a preface.

18:05.760 --> 18:06.720
This is a preface to.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.640
Sidebar.

18:08.640 --> 18:12.960
I'm saying he seems like a very nice young boy, and I think he likes to just pail around

18:12.960 --> 18:13.600
with his friends.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.400
He likes to run.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.760
Oh, that's your that's your in.

18:16.560 --> 18:23.200
You got to go to Manitoba or whatever Canadian province he lives in and you got to become

18:23.200 --> 18:26.720
his bud and you got to like shoot hoops with him and like bro out.

18:26.720 --> 18:30.160
Hey, Justin, who's this 36 year old do you're hanging out with?

18:30.160 --> 18:30.560
I don't know.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.640
He just wanted to shoot hoops and then he cut my hair.

18:32.640 --> 18:38.560
I yeah, I hope this 36 year old man isn't dating somebody who wants a lock of Justin

18:38.560 --> 18:43.600
Bieber hair because that either means that she's an insane person or she's 14.

18:44.240 --> 18:48.000
You realize that like that's how his like fan base works.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.440
It jumps from like 16 year old to like 46 year old.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.800
No, no, no, no, no.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.600
Yeah.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.040
The last Griffin 16 year old, 46 year old and Griffin.

18:57.040 --> 19:00.800
About half of Justin Bieber's fan base, the last person they obsessed ever was Jonathan

19:00.800 --> 19:03.680
Brandes from SeaQuest.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.920
There's a big gap there.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.080
He's the next best thing since River Phoenix.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.560
He's like, he's like today's Rob Lowe.

19:12.560 --> 19:13.520
No, I'm just kidding, ladies.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.680
Rob Lowe is today's Rob Lowe.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.080
Yeah, will he ever age?

19:18.080 --> 19:18.400
Nope.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.920
God, some of us are trying to live out here, Rob.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.560
How do you expect us to be what we be when you're around?

19:26.560 --> 19:28.880
How can we do what we do with Rob Lowe?

19:28.880 --> 19:30.800
He's just out there fucking the curve up.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.000
He makes it so hard.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.480
In the documentary, it goes around a few concerts.

19:36.480 --> 19:40.080
Listen, I'm the one that's best fucking suited to answer this question.

19:40.080 --> 19:43.200
So if you want to hate on me because I'm so well informed, then that's fine.

19:43.200 --> 19:43.840
I can take it.

19:45.040 --> 19:49.600
Every show he does, he brings on that special someone during his song.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.120
I believe it's somebody to love.

19:51.120 --> 19:55.040
I'm not sure, but he brings a sweet, a special lady on stage.

19:55.040 --> 19:59.200
And that special lady gets to sit in a chair while he dances around her and gives her flowers.

19:59.200 --> 20:04.160
So you're going to have to find a lady that can get up on stage because that's the closest

20:04.160 --> 20:07.760
you can get to Justin Bieber without like five layers of security guards between you.

20:07.760 --> 20:10.320
It's a shame that he does it during that song,

20:10.320 --> 20:13.600
as opposed to girl, hold these scissors while I stand real still.

20:16.880 --> 20:20.320
Can you imagine if you leaned in to like snip off a lock of his hair

20:20.320 --> 20:25.600
and he shook his head at an opportune time and he just blinded Justin Bieber?

20:25.600 --> 20:26.880
Tragedy struck today.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.600
Justin Bieber's new album is so edgy.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.440
It's probably because of the iPads.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.800
It's probably because of his Cybertronic eye.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.560
What if you cut his hair and all of a sudden he starts singing like Carol Channing?

20:41.840 --> 20:46.000
Turned out the whole time Samson like this part

20:46.000 --> 20:49.280
and belt out those sweet melodies was up there the whole time.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.040
I could see that.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.880
And then the devil appears and says,

20:52.880 --> 20:54.480
We had a deal, Bieber.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.200
Now pull some up and drag him to hell.

21:01.440 --> 21:05.600
And he's just dragged into like, you know, the cave of wonders and he's gone.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.480
Make a deal with the devil for some of Justin Bieber's hair.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.840
Like I feel like we're giving this guy so many options.

21:11.840 --> 21:12.800
How much are we charging him?

21:12.800 --> 21:15.840
You're saying he enters into a contract with Beelzebub?

21:15.840 --> 21:17.520
You're saying he sells his soul?

21:17.520 --> 21:19.200
It's important.

21:19.200 --> 21:23.200
This is only if he accidentally cuts Justin Bieber's hair,

21:23.200 --> 21:28.240
thereby nullifying the deal Justin Bieber made with the devil for his singing talent

21:28.800 --> 21:32.480
and forcing the devil to drag Justin Bieber to hell.

21:32.480 --> 21:36.880
At that point, Justin Bieber will be under the possession of Beelzebub.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.880
So he can trade for Bieber's hair.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.400
I mean, as long as we're shooting for the stars,

21:40.400 --> 21:43.920
why isn't he trying to find like a being John Malkovich sized door

21:43.920 --> 21:46.240
and climb into Justin Bieber's hair and mail some hair to himself?

21:46.240 --> 21:48.960
Plus his own hair off and mail- Travis, yes.

21:48.960 --> 21:49.520
Come on.

21:49.520 --> 21:50.080
I mean, come on.

21:50.080 --> 21:52.480
Let's just jump the shark here and go for it.

21:52.480 --> 21:52.960
We need to take-

21:52.960 --> 21:53.840
That's a perfect idea.

21:53.840 --> 21:57.200
We need to fucking occupy Justin Bieber.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.760
Have you guys heard about that new protest?

22:01.760 --> 22:03.120
Occupy Justin Bieber?

22:03.120 --> 22:05.280
Yeah, it's all about just getting right in him.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.560
You know, 99% of Justin Bieber is controlled by one Justin Bieber.

22:08.560 --> 22:08.720
Yeah.

22:08.720 --> 22:15.360
You know, the problem with the Justin Bieber door is that it's actually in Justin Bieber's house.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.080
So good luck.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.280
I mean, I watched the documentary.

22:19.280 --> 22:20.640
I know where his house is.

22:20.640 --> 22:21.760
Oh, we're doing this again?

22:21.760 --> 22:22.000
Cool.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.680
Let's just backtrack to talk about his film.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.520
Are you guys pretending like you haven't seen it?

22:25.520 --> 22:27.200
How many stars would you give it?

22:27.200 --> 22:28.320
Out of how many stars?

22:29.200 --> 22:29.600
Bieber.

22:30.480 --> 22:36.880
On a scale of zero stars to Bieber, I would give it two Jonas Brothers.

22:36.880 --> 22:37.840
Oh.

22:37.840 --> 22:38.720
Sounds fair.

22:38.720 --> 22:38.960
Yeah.

22:39.840 --> 22:44.160
So not perfect, but not bad either.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.840
It's informative as fuck.

22:45.840 --> 22:50.240
And it's in 3D, which is great because they really don't take much time to-

22:51.120 --> 22:53.600
They really don't pay much attention to the 3D aspect of the film,

22:54.320 --> 22:57.120
except at the end when he does the song, never say never,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.800
he does this whole pump up speech about how he came from nothing

23:00.800 --> 23:03.440
and now he's this big, big star and anyone can do it and follow your dreams

23:03.440 --> 23:08.000
and make sure that you never say never and the words never say never appear

23:08.000 --> 23:11.280
like they fly into the screen in three dimensions.

23:11.920 --> 23:12.960
I'm so sad right now.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.000
It's fucking incredible.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.520
What's your favorite Justin Bieber song, Travis?

23:16.240 --> 23:16.960
Shut up, Griffin.

23:16.960 --> 23:17.440
What is it?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.440
I don't know anything about Justin Bieber.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.960
You don't know any of his songs?

23:20.960 --> 23:21.280
No.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.080
I feel like you're being-

23:22.080 --> 23:22.960
He did Baby, right?

23:22.960 --> 23:23.200
Yep.

23:23.200 --> 23:27.680
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.120
Yeah, there are other words in it.

23:29.120 --> 23:29.600
Just in-

23:29.600 --> 23:30.000
What?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.760
There are other words in it than that one, Justin?

23:31.760 --> 23:32.640
Yes.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.760
The only song I know is, I know that because it was on a commercial

23:36.560 --> 23:38.720
about a Justin Bieber doll with real hair.

23:40.560 --> 23:41.040
There it is.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.400
Next best thing.

23:43.120 --> 23:43.440
Yep.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.040
Is this a real product or are you-

23:45.040 --> 23:45.360
It is.

23:45.360 --> 23:46.480
That is a real product.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.640
It's a Justin Bieber doll and it's got real hair on it.

23:48.640 --> 23:49.920
It can't be a real Justin Bieber.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.560
I don't think it's real Justin Bieber hair, but it's like real hair from somebody.

23:52.560 --> 23:53.920
Can you imagine Justin Bieber?

23:53.920 --> 23:56.720
He's like got to take a month off his tour to become a hair farm.

23:56.720 --> 24:02.240
I don't, I like cage free Bieber hair is what I prefer, I think.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.320
He drinks freckle juice and it just all goes crazy.

24:04.320 --> 24:04.640
Yeah.

24:04.640 --> 24:05.520
He's got hair everywhere.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.520
Oh God, what a reference.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.040
I know, be good.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.120
Justin, what's your favorite Justin Bieber song?

24:11.760 --> 24:13.200
My favorite Justin Bieber song?

24:13.200 --> 24:13.700
Mm-hmm.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.800
Don't say Baby because Travis already said that one.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.000
No, I didn't say it was my favorite.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.200
I said it was the only one I knew.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.160
So your favorite then?

24:22.720 --> 24:23.680
I think Pussy Control.

24:23.680 --> 24:24.160
Okay.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.680
His cover of Pussy Control.

24:25.680 --> 24:28.400
Yeah, well, he wrote it, cover it with Prince.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.600
I didn't know that.

24:30.160 --> 24:30.660
Yeah.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.520
I don't think Justin Bieber knows what a pussy is yet.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.560
Have you seen his haircut?

24:36.560 --> 24:39.120
I'm pretty sure he's an expert on being a pussy.

24:39.120 --> 24:41.120
Oh Justin.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.280
That wasn't on the show, right?

24:43.280 --> 24:44.240
That's just rapping.

24:44.240 --> 24:49.120
I'm going to need, I'm going to need to form my brother, my brother and me, Justin Bieber

24:49.120 --> 24:49.920
defense force.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.320
Okay, that's cool.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.240
We'll finally get some Travis here.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.480
We'll finally get some Travis on Google.

24:56.480 --> 24:57.040
Okay.

24:57.040 --> 24:57.540
Hooray!

24:58.160 --> 24:58.880
Finally get some Travis.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.880
Can we become the official Beebcast?

25:01.760 --> 25:07.360
Yeah, there's probably no other online resources dedicated to him preserving his memory.

25:07.360 --> 25:09.040
He's pretty underground at this point.

25:09.040 --> 25:14.240
I want to be the go-to internet destination for Justin Bieber goofs.

25:14.880 --> 25:24.000
Can you create a groundswell grassroots Bieber fan club to support him so you can basically

25:24.000 --> 25:28.240
be on, he's going to fall off in popularity and then there will be an inevitable resurgence.

25:28.240 --> 25:34.640
Can you be the underground groundswell grassroots fan club for his inevitable resurgence?

25:34.640 --> 25:35.360
Can you-

25:35.360 --> 25:40.960
Let's start when, as soon as we're done with this episode, I will start the Occupy Bieber

25:40.960 --> 25:41.520
hashtag.

25:42.480 --> 25:47.360
I actually already used the Occupy Justin Bieber hashtag earlier in the week, so.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.280
Under what pretense?

25:49.280 --> 25:54.400
That if they wanted the Occupy Wall Street thing to call, to trend on Twitter, they should

25:54.400 --> 25:55.680
call Occupy Justin Bieber.

25:55.680 --> 25:56.640
Did you really say that?

25:57.360 --> 25:57.920
Yeah.

25:57.920 --> 25:58.640
That's crazy.

25:59.440 --> 26:00.560
Yeah, check the hashtag.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.520
It's crazy.

26:01.520 --> 26:05.840
Hey, do you have any advice for coping with stress, how to make sure your relationship

26:05.840 --> 26:07.920
stays strong during stressful times?

26:08.480 --> 26:12.320
I just started law school and my girlfriend is in her last semester of undergrad, works

26:12.320 --> 26:14.320
two jobs and is preparing for graduate school.

26:14.320 --> 26:18.640
As should be playing, we both have lots of stress in our lives and sometimes it seems

26:18.640 --> 26:19.200
overwhelming.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.920
Haven't had a romantic date night in over a month.

26:21.920 --> 26:26.000
Do you guys have any wisdom for keeping the spark alive during these rough times?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.760
Stressed student in St. Louis.

26:29.520 --> 26:33.680
I personally feel like the most important thing is to remember that they are not an

26:33.680 --> 26:35.200
outlet for your stress.

26:35.200 --> 26:40.080
They can be a sounding board for when you're having a bad day, but they are not the cause

26:40.080 --> 26:42.480
of your stress and therefore you shouldn't unload it on them.

26:42.480 --> 26:45.040
Or how do they get rid of it then?

26:45.040 --> 26:45.680
How do they get through that?

26:45.680 --> 26:49.840
You can talk to them about it, but I'm saying talking about it is different from snapping

26:49.840 --> 26:51.520
at them and taking it out on them.

26:52.400 --> 26:52.880
You know what I mean?

26:55.440 --> 27:02.000
In my experience, my limited experience, the most important thing is boundaries.

27:03.280 --> 27:06.480
When you're with the person, be with them 100%.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.840
Because you could be surprised, even if you don't have time for a romantic date night,

27:11.840 --> 27:20.960
you would be surprised at how much you can connect in a half hour of just exclusively

27:20.960 --> 27:24.720
looking at each other, talking, not about work or anything else.

27:25.440 --> 27:26.240
Not even eating.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.000
Just doing exactly that.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.840
Just mindless staring.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.280
Yeah, just staring at each other.

27:32.080 --> 27:32.880
Slack jawed.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.760
Yeah, so when you're doing that, be doing that.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.480
Don't try to be doing a bunch of other things.

27:40.480 --> 27:43.920
Put the phones away and just do that for a few minutes.

27:43.920 --> 27:50.320
I would suggest that whenever you two do have free time to spend together, you relax and

27:51.120 --> 27:56.640
just hang out together in a room with some good buds.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Wink at the microphone.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.120
Do you mean some of their friends?

28:01.920 --> 28:08.160
I mean, if you're trying to get rid of some stress, maybe you should hang out with some

28:08.160 --> 28:10.480
good buds.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.880
Are you saying like their friend, Mary Jane?

28:12.880 --> 28:16.800
I'm saying like their friend, Toker Grace.

28:18.800 --> 28:19.920
I'm so confused.

28:19.920 --> 28:20.880
Reefer Sutherland.

28:22.080 --> 28:22.880
Okay, wait.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.280
I'm talking about that dank herb.

28:30.000 --> 28:30.960
All right.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.240
I'm talking about that kind, that kind ganj.

28:34.240 --> 28:41.520
You mean some of that Ashton Koosh.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.200
Don't do that, though.

28:43.200 --> 28:46.320
Wheat, marijuana, is that what you're talking about?

28:46.320 --> 28:47.320
But don't do it.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.320
Don't do that.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.320
Don't do that.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.320
I said that.

28:50.320 --> 28:51.320
Maybe just get really drunk.

28:51.320 --> 28:52.320
I said that in remembrance of Goose.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.320
Hey, find some.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.320
Just let me know where to buy it.

28:54.320 --> 28:55.320
Because I'm 30.

28:55.320 --> 28:56.320
I don't know.

28:56.320 --> 28:57.320
And we are not cops.

28:57.320 --> 28:58.320
We are not cops.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.320
We're brothers.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.320
We're brothers.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.560
Because I am Johnny Cash over here.

29:02.560 --> 29:08.320
I need some, I need some of that kind, kind herb.

29:08.320 --> 29:09.520
I am George Joneson.

29:12.400 --> 29:12.960
Shut up.

29:15.280 --> 29:18.160
Hey, you know, if I'm going to buy all this weed,

29:18.160 --> 29:19.120
I'm going to need some money.

29:19.120 --> 29:34.880
Travis, who is this message for?

29:34.880 --> 29:37.200
This message is for Rob Starbin.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.600
All right, Rob Starbin.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.360
Who is it from?

29:41.360 --> 29:44.640
It's from Allegra, Alexis, Paige, Wes, and Brub.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.640
You guys are excited.

29:46.640 --> 29:51.120
Hey, happy 32nd birthday, Rob.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.880
There's 10 exclamation points.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.720
That's how it sounds.

29:54.720 --> 29:58.160
Griffin, real quick, give me the highlights of Rob.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.920
What's Rob into?

29:59.920 --> 30:01.160
What's Rob all about?

30:01.160 --> 30:04.160
I hear Rob's into video games and board games,

30:04.160 --> 30:05.120
all kinds of games.

30:05.120 --> 30:07.680
He's into cats, his cats specifically.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.160
He likes the Mets.

30:09.160 --> 30:14.160
He likes the Gamers with Jobs podcast and website.

30:14.160 --> 30:15.760
It's a website too, right?

30:15.760 --> 30:16.840
Sure, yeah.

30:16.840 --> 30:20.280
He likes 80s music and, of course, my brother, my brother,

30:20.280 --> 30:20.780
and me.

30:20.780 --> 30:23.040
Thank you, Rob.

30:23.040 --> 30:25.120
Rob sounds like a down guy.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.000
You know what I like about Rob?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.720
The many, many pronunciations you

30:28.720 --> 30:30.800
can apply to his last name.

30:30.800 --> 30:31.320
Yeah.

30:31.320 --> 30:31.820
Starobin.

30:35.400 --> 30:39.280
Starobin.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.000
Starobin.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.640
There's just so many options.

30:42.640 --> 30:43.640
There's a lot of options.

30:43.640 --> 30:45.080
Happy birthday, Rob.

30:45.080 --> 30:47.560
I got to tell you guys, different ways

30:47.560 --> 30:51.680
of pronouncing Starobin is going to be one of our classic bits.

30:51.680 --> 30:52.600
Put it on the sample.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.960
I think that's one people are really going to treasure.

30:54.960 --> 30:58.080
It's like they're going to forget all about peepum stuff

30:58.080 --> 30:59.120
and crocuswine.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.160
Forget that or that.

31:00.160 --> 31:00.760
Crocuswine.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.960
And there was this one part where he said Starobin.

31:02.960 --> 31:03.460
Ah!

31:03.460 --> 31:06.520
It was awesome.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.400
Rob Strusel, happy birthday, my friend.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.120
Happy birthday, Sturmy.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.240
If you want us to make fun of your last name,

31:12.240 --> 31:13.240
get on the Jumbotron.

31:13.240 --> 31:16.800
It's maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.880
Give us some money, and we'll give you some fame.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.480
You know, I was a special present to Rob.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.000
I wrote him a little something.

31:24.000 --> 31:24.520
Fuck.

31:24.520 --> 31:25.240
Really?

31:25.240 --> 31:26.640
Are you doing this again?

31:26.640 --> 31:28.320
I've written a madman for the people.

31:28.320 --> 31:28.800
Oh, fuck.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.640
No.

31:30.640 --> 31:30.960
No.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.480
Everybody seemed to like it so much last time.

31:32.480 --> 31:32.760
Yeah.

31:32.760 --> 31:33.240
Guess what?

31:33.240 --> 31:35.120
I'm going to edit it right out of the show.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.200
But I wanted to give the people what they want.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.480
Is this what the people want?

31:38.480 --> 31:41.280
Can we put up a fucking straw poll?

31:41.280 --> 31:44.240
I feel like this is what the people, they crave.

31:44.240 --> 31:46.480
They crave that crazy crunch.

31:46.480 --> 31:49.840
I feel like people out there crave me and Griffin

31:49.840 --> 31:51.320
being angry at you.

31:51.320 --> 31:53.600
That's also possibly true.

31:53.600 --> 31:56.400
Travis, the last time you did this, after I read the last one,

31:56.400 --> 32:00.680
it was so bad that I almost got bone cancer.

32:00.680 --> 32:01.640
That's bad.

32:01.640 --> 32:04.200
He would have had to go get some of Bieber's marrow to cure him.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.560
Is that what you want?

32:05.560 --> 32:06.640
Sort of.

32:06.640 --> 32:07.400
OK.

32:07.400 --> 32:07.920
All right.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.000
Well, Travis, I'm not reading your stupid thing.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.040
If it makes you guys feel better, I will read this one.

32:12.040 --> 32:13.880
You're going to read it like a dummy, though.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.960
No, I'm going to read it so good.

32:15.960 --> 32:16.800
Do a good job.

32:16.800 --> 32:21.000
You have a reading voice that makes you sound so precious.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.160
Oh, thank you.

32:22.160 --> 32:22.920
Like the movie?

32:22.920 --> 32:24.600
OK, here we go.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.120
Take it away, Gabriel.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.200
It was a moist and stormy dongle.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.960
The bulky maid was in the conservatory

32:30.960 --> 32:34.160
with the thunderful botanist, playing the savory flugelhorn.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.840
Suddenly, the cacophony was interrupted by the hullabaloo

32:36.840 --> 32:38.040
of a chocolate wazoo.

32:38.040 --> 32:41.040
Corporal Buffalo, recently returned from his voluptuous tour

32:41.040 --> 32:43.840
of the lumpy Madagascar, was flabbergasted.

32:43.840 --> 32:46.920
He swung his girth around the unfathomable piano,

32:46.920 --> 32:49.920
only to find that the rat king had been crunchetized.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.600
Fiddlesticks yelled the corporal.

32:51.600 --> 32:54.440
What humperdink has snogged my bountiful rat king?

32:54.440 --> 32:57.480
Cool your paella, ricocheted Professor Pumbanickle.

32:57.480 --> 32:59.760
Your hubris could outweigh Fraggle Rock.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.800
Now stop being such a harbinger, and come

33:01.800 --> 33:03.840
try these totes delicious crepes.

33:03.840 --> 33:06.320
Excelsior decreed Madame Jambalaya,

33:06.320 --> 33:08.120
and a moist time was had by all.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.120
God damn it.

33:09.120 --> 33:09.960
God damn it.

33:09.960 --> 33:12.920
It's like watching a man die in front of me.

33:12.920 --> 33:15.760
It's like watching a man bleed out.

33:15.760 --> 33:18.360
It's like watching the last Native American bleed out

33:18.360 --> 33:20.200
in front of me.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.400
The last of his people, it's like watching

33:22.400 --> 33:23.400
them die in front of me.

33:23.400 --> 33:27.400
That's the level of sadness that your Mad Libs bring me.

33:27.400 --> 33:28.520
God damn it.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.320
Everybody else seemed to like it.

33:34.320 --> 33:35.320
No, they didn't, Travis.

33:35.320 --> 33:35.800
Stay.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.000
No, they didn't.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.160
Travis, there's maybe this bit might

33:39.160 --> 33:41.200
make the show friendly to four-year-olds

33:41.200 --> 33:45.560
who find words like pumpernickel still amusing.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.200
Travis, if those cheese eaters knew

33:47.200 --> 33:48.720
what should be in a podcast, they'd

33:48.720 --> 33:50.840
be making our goddamn podcast.

33:50.840 --> 33:52.200
I don't know what should be in it.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.600
I've read rat king, and Fraggle Rock, and crunchetized.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.600
It makes the people happy.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.320
Don't you say those fucking words again,

33:58.320 --> 34:00.560
where I'm outlawing every word you just

34:00.560 --> 34:02.480
said for this podcast forever.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.120
You kill those words for me.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.640
I can't say it was a moistened storm in the ongoing game.

34:06.640 --> 34:09.720
Travis, I fucking, I will hang up on you.

34:09.720 --> 34:11.200
There's nothing funny about it.

34:11.200 --> 34:13.840
There's nothing funny about it.

34:13.840 --> 34:14.640
You love it.

34:14.640 --> 34:15.840
You love it so much.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.280
It's the opposite of comedy.

34:17.280 --> 34:21.880
I can feel my bones throbbing with cancer.

34:21.880 --> 34:23.760
You know, it was a wise man who once

34:23.760 --> 34:27.040
said that comedy is Mad Libs plus time.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.200
So in like three weeks, you'll go back and listen to this,

34:29.200 --> 34:30.800
and you will be laughing your balls off.

34:30.800 --> 34:36.880
It's Mad Libs minus Mad Libs plus dick jokes.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.400
Can we get back to our core competency?

34:39.400 --> 34:40.280
Yeah.

34:40.280 --> 34:42.440
Sorry that we ruined your birthday, Rob.

34:42.440 --> 34:42.920
Hey, Rob.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.160
Happy birthday.

34:44.160 --> 34:44.680
Happy unbirthday.

34:44.680 --> 34:47.920
Happy birthday, Mr. Sterebe.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.160
I'm a mid-20s guy.

34:49.160 --> 34:52.920
And lately, I've been thinking about getting manicured.

34:52.920 --> 34:56.320
I keep hearing people talk about how relaxing they are

34:56.320 --> 34:58.320
and how good they feel.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.200
I know that some guys get them, but I just

35:00.200 --> 35:02.240
can't quite bring myself to get one.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.360
Is it worth the certain ridicule for my friends

35:04.360 --> 35:05.760
to give this a shot?

35:05.760 --> 35:08.880
Or will my man card be permanently in jeopardy

35:08.880 --> 35:10.240
if I go through with it?

35:10.240 --> 35:12.840
Man curious in the Midwest.

35:12.840 --> 35:13.600
It's man.

35:13.600 --> 35:17.440
I feel like let's make sure that we're not manicurious.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.360
Not manicurious.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.920
I say you do it.

35:20.920 --> 35:21.400
Do it.

35:21.400 --> 35:22.240
Go for it.

35:22.240 --> 35:22.880
Treat yourself.

35:22.880 --> 35:23.680
Hands up.

35:23.680 --> 35:24.520
Hands up.

35:24.520 --> 35:27.440
Who on this podcast has gotten a manicure before?

35:27.440 --> 35:27.960
Hands up.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.000
I have.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.360
I have.

35:30.360 --> 35:30.920
It's glorious.

35:30.920 --> 35:31.920
It feels great, right?

35:31.920 --> 35:32.960
It's like a massage for your cuticles.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.160
Are you two fucking with me right now?

35:34.160 --> 35:34.680
No.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.080
Here's the thing about it.

35:36.080 --> 35:39.160
I think that society needs to swing back to the 50s,

35:39.160 --> 35:42.360
like this idea of when dudes were like suits and hats

35:42.360 --> 35:45.240
all the time, classy as shit, and we

35:45.240 --> 35:48.400
have turned into this grungy asshole world.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.360
And I want to get back to you when

35:50.360 --> 35:53.640
it was more respected that you took care of yourself.

35:53.640 --> 35:55.800
Justin, have you ever known the thrill of having shiny

35:55.800 --> 35:57.560
fingernails?

35:57.560 --> 35:59.640
It's fucking exhilarating.

35:59.640 --> 36:01.320
You feel like a new man.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.600
It's a confidence builder.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.720
You're like, yeah, I'm better than you because

36:04.720 --> 36:05.720
of this thing I've done.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.920
I don't think that's true.

36:07.920 --> 36:10.920
I don't have a problem with it if you guys want to do it.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.200
I live in West Virginia.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.760
I can't have shiny fingernails.

36:13.760 --> 36:15.400
I'll be run out of town on a rail.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.600
Shiny fingernails are like a flag that says,

36:17.600 --> 36:19.280
I've risen above the rabble.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.600
It is like shiny finger armor.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.120
It is.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.160
It's like shiny finger armor.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.080
Nobody.

36:25.080 --> 36:27.240
That keeps away the bad feelings.

36:27.240 --> 36:31.680
I feel like if everyone got manicures,

36:31.680 --> 36:35.920
then there wouldn't be such a there wouldn't be class warfare

36:35.920 --> 36:36.680
going on right now.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.280
Everyone would be upper class.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.000
Yeah, because we'd all be rich because we

36:40.000 --> 36:41.080
could afford someone to walk.

36:41.080 --> 36:44.640
That being said, really nails will make a really awkward

36:44.640 --> 36:46.240
conversation is on the job site.

36:46.240 --> 36:48.240
Be like, hey, Frank, would you bring for lunch?

36:48.240 --> 36:48.680
That's cool.

36:48.680 --> 36:49.280
Cool.

36:49.280 --> 36:54.360
Can I just say your fingernails look fabulous, delectable?

36:54.360 --> 36:55.320
It feels great.

36:55.320 --> 36:56.440
It looks great.

36:56.440 --> 36:57.040
Do it.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.520
Get it done.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.600
Yeah, and if your friends give you shit,

37:00.600 --> 37:02.840
just be like, hey, it's because I'm classier than you.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.480
Yeah, don't be jealous of my class.

37:05.480 --> 37:08.440
There is something cool about a guy that can own that look.

37:08.440 --> 37:10.040
Get a manicure and just own it.

37:10.040 --> 37:13.880
Can I ask you guys seriously, what does a person

37:13.880 --> 37:15.160
pay for something like that?

37:15.160 --> 37:16.200
I got it done by a friend.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.160
What does that pay?

37:17.160 --> 37:17.680
What?

37:17.680 --> 37:18.760
I got it done by a friend.

37:18.760 --> 37:21.120
It wasn't a license to manicure it.

37:21.120 --> 37:22.880
$30, $35.

37:22.880 --> 37:23.400
Fuck you.

37:23.400 --> 37:23.880
What?

37:23.880 --> 37:25.160
Yeah, but you get it done once.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.520
And if you're going really nice,

37:26.520 --> 37:27.720
you can get it done for like $20.

37:27.720 --> 37:28.800
It's a luxury.

37:28.800 --> 37:29.640
Yeah.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.000
It's not something you get done like every day.

37:31.000 --> 37:31.880
Do you get your shoes shined?

37:31.880 --> 37:33.120
Do you get massages every day?

37:33.120 --> 37:35.080
No, it's a luxury item.

37:35.080 --> 37:38.280
Travis, have you ever turned a homeless person down

37:38.280 --> 37:40.480
when they ask you for money?

37:40.480 --> 37:42.000
Well, yeah, all the time.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.880
OK, so next time you do that, I want

37:44.880 --> 37:47.640
you to look them dead in the eye and say, sorry, bro.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.400
Gotta have the shine.

37:49.400 --> 37:53.440
Can you give that person $20 to rub a rough pad

37:53.440 --> 37:57.680
over your fingernails until the grime comes off?

37:57.680 --> 38:00.000
So you're saying that we need to mobilize our homeless

38:00.000 --> 38:01.320
and make them like a manicure army.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.680
That's exactly what I'm saying.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.520
A mobile army of manicurists.

38:04.520 --> 38:05.600
A mani-pedi.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.440
Don't be afraid to be who you are.

38:07.440 --> 38:08.760
If you're the kind of person that

38:08.760 --> 38:13.400
wants to have beautiful, pristine fucking Geena Davis

38:13.400 --> 38:17.240
hands, then you shouldn't be afraid to get those Geena Davis

38:17.240 --> 38:18.040
hands.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.080
You know what, Griffin?

38:19.080 --> 38:22.000
I think you've reminded me of something.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.720
It's a debate I've gone through with myself

38:23.720 --> 38:25.800
for a long time about getting a motorcycle.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.720
And I would love to be the type of person that

38:27.720 --> 38:30.080
rides a motorcycle, but I often have to think,

38:30.080 --> 38:32.600
am I the type of person that would like to ride a motorcycle,

38:32.600 --> 38:34.920
or am I the type of person that should ride a motorcycle?

38:34.920 --> 38:35.480
That's stupid.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.960
I think, well, I think that's what you have to ask yourself

38:37.960 --> 38:40.760
is, am I the type of person that thinks it might be fun

38:40.760 --> 38:43.080
and weird, or am I the type of person that is a manicure

38:43.080 --> 38:43.600
person?

38:43.600 --> 38:45.440
Because if you are a manicure person,

38:45.440 --> 38:47.600
your friends aren't going to give you shit about it.

38:47.600 --> 38:50.080
If it is incongruous with your personality,

38:50.080 --> 38:51.600
you're going to get shit about it.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.080
Yeah, that's a fair point.

38:53.080 --> 38:56.800
Have you built up enough of a persona

38:56.800 --> 38:58.880
that you could carry that you could pull that off?

38:58.880 --> 38:59.960
I think that's horse app.

38:59.960 --> 39:02.200
I think you need to reinvent yourself as frequently

39:02.200 --> 39:03.720
as you possibly can.

39:03.720 --> 39:04.480
I think, guess what?

39:04.480 --> 39:09.240
If you go get a medicare, if you go get a manicure,

39:09.240 --> 39:10.880
and you love how it feels, and you say,

39:10.880 --> 39:12.360
I'm going to keep doing this, then guess what?

39:12.360 --> 39:14.080
You're the type of person who gets a manicure.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.520
Don't be so insincere about it.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.920
I'm not saying not to do it.

39:16.920 --> 39:20.200
I am saying that that is what makes people respond

39:20.200 --> 39:24.800
to it in a mocking way, is that it's incongruous with you

39:24.800 --> 39:26.920
or the image of you they have in their head.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.720
Yeah, but that means that that person never

39:28.720 --> 39:30.600
gets to do any new stuff if they're going to live

39:30.600 --> 39:31.720
in fear of that perception.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.920
No, I'm just saying be braced for that.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.000
And that's why they're mocking you.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.520
Well, yeah, I could tell this dude, if you go get a manicure,

39:37.520 --> 39:39.040
people are going to make fun of you.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.520
Yeah, for sure.

39:40.520 --> 39:42.280
But what I'm saying is not because there's

39:42.280 --> 39:44.360
anything wrong with it, but because they're

39:44.360 --> 39:46.480
surprised by it.

39:46.480 --> 39:50.360
It's like how some guys can wear a hat.

39:50.360 --> 39:53.160
You're a hat guy or a manicure guy.

39:53.160 --> 39:53.920
I get that.

39:53.920 --> 39:55.400
I'm not sure you're right, but I certainly

39:55.400 --> 39:56.320
understand what you're saying.

39:56.320 --> 39:57.880
I'm almost positive I'm right.

39:57.880 --> 40:00.120
Homework assignment for Justin.

40:00.120 --> 40:03.400
I want you to go get a manicure sometime this week.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.680
Yeah.

40:04.680 --> 40:05.920
I'm serious.

40:05.920 --> 40:07.920
I want you to know what it feels like.

40:07.920 --> 40:10.600
I'm going to do it because I have paint in my cuticles

40:10.600 --> 40:12.120
that I just cannot get out.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.080
Can I be honest with you?

40:13.080 --> 40:16.800
I'm kind of afraid that they'll make fun of the finger

40:16.800 --> 40:18.160
that the TV fell on.

40:18.160 --> 40:18.920
Oh.

40:18.920 --> 40:20.080
Don't worry about it.

40:20.080 --> 40:20.800
That's so weird.

40:20.800 --> 40:21.920
That's your special finger.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.160
That's your special spatula finger.

40:24.160 --> 40:27.040
OK, well, I'm just afraid they'll make fun of my deformity.

40:27.040 --> 40:29.080
Sweetheart, that's my favorite finger.

40:29.080 --> 40:31.680
I've been living my life with a handicapped for 20 years.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.000
Let me see it.

40:33.000 --> 40:33.520
Aw.

40:33.520 --> 40:34.520
Here.

40:34.520 --> 40:35.360
Shut up.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.240
That's your lucky finger.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.120
It looks really bad.

40:37.120 --> 40:37.840
It looks stupid.

40:37.840 --> 40:38.520
No, it doesn't.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.080
It's just a little flat.

40:40.080 --> 40:41.080
They're going to hate it.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.200
No.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.640
No, that's your flat, Stanley finger.

40:43.640 --> 40:45.000
That's your flat, Stanley finger.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.880
I hate my finger.

40:46.880 --> 40:48.280
Then I hate them.

40:48.280 --> 40:51.200
It only has half a nail, and it has a big scar on the back.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.160
Who's my special guy?

40:52.160 --> 40:52.880
Terrible finger.

40:52.880 --> 40:54.520
That's why I can't play guitar very well.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.480
Who's my special guy?

40:56.480 --> 40:57.560
I guess I am.

40:57.560 --> 40:59.520
It's you.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.320
Griffin, will you read Yahoo and cheer me on?

41:01.320 --> 41:04.640
Manhole cover finger.

41:04.640 --> 41:05.720
OK.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.760
This Yahoo answer was also sent in by Galiayali.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.040
It's by Yahoo answer's user, Patrick, who asks,

41:10.040 --> 41:12.480
I have tiny nipples.

41:12.480 --> 41:13.840
How can I improve their size?

41:13.840 --> 41:16.280
He, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he.

41:16.280 --> 41:17.120
You go obvious.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.160
Tattoo.

41:18.160 --> 41:20.400
I get made fun of at school for the size of my nipples.

41:20.400 --> 41:21.640
Please help.

41:21.640 --> 41:22.160
Wait, what?

41:22.160 --> 41:23.480
Yeah.

41:23.480 --> 41:25.400
How often are you setting yourself up for that?

41:25.400 --> 41:25.880
Yeah.

41:25.880 --> 41:27.720
What's up, Skittle Nips?

41:27.720 --> 41:31.360
Yeah, does that happen like every day?

41:31.360 --> 41:32.960
I mean, where'd your nipples go?

41:32.960 --> 41:33.440
Sweet.

41:33.440 --> 41:33.960
Nice, bro.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.280
High five.

41:35.280 --> 41:37.760
To make it big, I mean, tattoo, there's the, the, uh.

41:37.760 --> 41:40.320
Are you saying tattoo bigger nipples on your nipples?

41:40.320 --> 41:41.960
Tattoo bigger nipples on your nipples.

41:41.960 --> 41:42.680
It won't fill them.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.600
Oh, that's my second areola.

41:44.600 --> 41:45.720
I have rings.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.280
What if you just went old fashioned

41:47.280 --> 41:50.240
and just went for, like, tassels?

41:50.240 --> 41:51.360
Oh, that's not bad.

41:51.360 --> 41:52.400
I like pasties, maybe.

41:52.400 --> 41:52.900
Yeah.

41:52.900 --> 41:54.000
Pasty, fake.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.120
Where do you buy, where do you buy fake nipple pasties at?

41:57.120 --> 41:59.400
Pasties that look like bigger nipples than the nipples you

41:59.400 --> 42:00.960
have.

42:00.960 --> 42:01.880
What about the, uh.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.760
Spencer's gifts?

42:03.760 --> 42:05.280
Always the junior contingency.

42:05.280 --> 42:06.480
Just get pregnant.

42:06.480 --> 42:06.980
Yeah.

42:06.980 --> 42:09.280
Does that make your, does that make your nipples bigger?

42:09.280 --> 42:10.480
Yeah, when you nurse.

42:10.480 --> 42:11.000
Makes them bigger.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.640
And from what I've heard, purple, so.

42:12.640 --> 42:13.800
Oh, man.

42:13.800 --> 42:14.480
I know.

42:14.480 --> 42:15.600
Yeah, it just ruins them.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.400
That whole situation's effed up.

42:17.400 --> 42:19.520
Yeah, it looks like a Coca-Cola faucet in there.

42:19.520 --> 42:20.120
It's disgusting.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.080
What does that even mean?

42:21.080 --> 42:23.880
Maybe just constantly give yourself purple nurples.

42:23.880 --> 42:26.120
Get someone to nurse on you, but you

42:26.120 --> 42:27.160
don't have to be pregnant.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.680
Can that just be a thing?

42:28.680 --> 42:31.160
Oh, so you're talking about nipple hickeys.

42:31.160 --> 42:31.660
Yeah.

42:31.660 --> 42:33.240
Oh, man.

42:33.240 --> 42:34.760
Are you sad now?

42:34.760 --> 42:36.680
I was sad before.

42:36.680 --> 42:40.960
Who's born this way, baby?

42:40.960 --> 42:44.560
Can we put these nipples in some sort of rack?

42:44.560 --> 42:46.920
Stretch them right out?

42:46.920 --> 42:49.080
So you're not talking about, like, size.

42:49.080 --> 42:50.080
You're talking about length.

42:50.080 --> 42:53.520
No, no, no, I'm saying side to side.

42:53.520 --> 42:54.400
Uh-huh.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.960
OK.

42:55.960 --> 42:58.200
Like a taffy-pulling machine.

42:58.200 --> 43:01.880
Yeah, some sort of taffy machine.

43:01.880 --> 43:02.380
Yeah.

43:02.380 --> 43:02.880
Yeah.

43:02.880 --> 43:03.380
Yeah.

43:03.380 --> 43:03.880
Sure.

43:03.880 --> 43:04.380
Yeah.

43:04.380 --> 43:06.800
Yeah, that's the one.

43:06.800 --> 43:07.800
That's the ticket?

43:07.800 --> 43:09.240
A taffy machine.

43:09.240 --> 43:10.800
How do you?

43:10.800 --> 43:11.960
This has to be an issue, right?

43:11.960 --> 43:14.680
Because this is not all nipples are made equal.

43:14.680 --> 43:16.680
Some are weird.

43:16.680 --> 43:18.080
And it sounds like these are.

43:18.080 --> 43:20.520
If they're so small that people are making fun of them,

43:20.520 --> 43:22.800
we're talking about fucking dimes.

43:22.800 --> 43:26.920
We're talking about some miniscule nippies.

43:26.920 --> 43:29.760
What about just, like, the power of positive thinking?

43:29.760 --> 43:30.800
Mind over matter.

43:30.800 --> 43:35.080
Have you read The Secret?

43:35.080 --> 43:36.280
The Secret to Big Nipples.

43:36.280 --> 43:40.560
The Secret to Dilating Those Nips.

43:40.560 --> 43:42.020
There have to be some sort of drops

43:42.020 --> 43:43.100
you can put on there, right?

43:43.100 --> 43:43.900
Some sort of salve.

43:43.900 --> 43:44.640
Yeah.

43:44.640 --> 43:45.360
Uh-huh.

43:45.360 --> 43:46.040
Yeah.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.280
Or salvia.

43:47.280 --> 43:48.600
Yeah.

43:48.600 --> 43:51.400
That smoke in that will make your nipples bigger.

43:51.400 --> 43:52.600
Scientifically proven.

43:52.600 --> 43:59.280
Hey, is it OK to bring reading material into a group restroom?

43:59.280 --> 44:04.040
Is it OK to bring a Kindle into any restroom, especially

44:04.040 --> 44:05.000
a group one?

44:05.000 --> 44:06.480
That's from Bored in the Bathroom.

44:06.480 --> 44:07.280
There's so many.

44:07.280 --> 44:08.080
Oh, that's easy.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.360
No and no.

44:09.360 --> 44:11.640
Well, there's so many questions here.

44:11.640 --> 44:15.560
The first being, what isn't a group restroom?

44:15.560 --> 44:16.040
Yeah.

44:16.040 --> 44:20.480
God, I would love a private restroom.

44:20.480 --> 44:23.160
This is Jeremy's bathroom.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.000
No one can come in here but Jeremy.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.040
You got a, like, fingerprint lock to get in?

44:27.040 --> 44:27.760
Yeah.

44:27.760 --> 44:30.120
Man, that would be fucking great, though, wouldn't it?

44:30.120 --> 44:31.760
That would be so good.

44:31.760 --> 44:36.440
I would also like to posit to go true to the name

44:36.440 --> 44:38.720
and have an actual group restroom.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.960
And I'm just like, everybody goes in at the same time.

44:40.960 --> 44:41.800
It's like, let's do this.

44:41.800 --> 44:42.160
Well, they-

44:42.160 --> 44:42.800
What are you reading?

44:42.800 --> 44:44.080
They have those, Travis.

44:44.080 --> 44:44.720
They have those.

44:44.720 --> 44:45.520
They're called restroom.

44:45.520 --> 44:47.360
No, I'm saying like, get rid of the walls and everything.

44:47.360 --> 44:47.920
Oh, you're talking-

44:47.920 --> 44:49.640
OK, you're a kind of open planet.

44:49.640 --> 44:51.440
That's just the worst thing I've ever heard.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.480
Like, done by Frank Lloyd Wright, you know?

44:53.480 --> 44:54.760
This is my bathroom falling off.

44:54.760 --> 44:56.400
Frank Lloyd Wright was fucking nasty.

44:56.400 --> 44:59.360
Ba dum chh.

44:59.360 --> 45:03.160
I'm making some falling water over here.

45:03.160 --> 45:04.360
That was a Frank Lloyd Wright joke.

45:04.360 --> 45:05.880
You know, he actually built a house

45:05.880 --> 45:07.760
like that that was, like, based on a desert.

45:07.760 --> 45:09.680
And there were no walls and nothing separating,

45:09.680 --> 45:11.280
like, the kitchen and bedroom and bathroom.

45:11.280 --> 45:11.760
Yeah.

45:11.760 --> 45:13.120
Like, just wherever you were in the house,

45:13.120 --> 45:14.560
you could see every other part of the house.

45:14.560 --> 45:15.440
And I think that's gross.

45:15.440 --> 45:17.160
And the toilet was right in the middle of the living room

45:17.160 --> 45:19.480
because he was so fucking nasty.

45:19.480 --> 45:20.360
Mm-hmm.

45:20.360 --> 45:23.680
Frank Lloyd Wright, you dirty boy.

45:23.680 --> 45:25.280
Frank Lloyd Wright, you're wrong.

45:25.280 --> 45:29.000
Frank Lloyd Dirty Boy sounds like a pretty good hip hop name.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.440
Is there, like, Soulja Boy talent?

45:31.440 --> 45:34.640
Frank Lloyd Dirty Boy.

45:34.640 --> 45:36.720
It's got a good cadence to it.

45:36.720 --> 45:38.040
I'm not sure.

45:38.040 --> 45:41.200
I don't think there's a big problem with it.

45:41.200 --> 45:44.480
I think that if you are carrying a mag- like,

45:44.480 --> 45:47.560
let's say a magazine.

45:47.560 --> 45:49.080
If you're carrying a magazine, I think

45:49.080 --> 45:51.400
it's OK to have one in the bathroom.

45:51.400 --> 45:54.400
I don't think it's OK to be spotted carrying one

45:54.400 --> 45:55.800
to the bathroom.

45:55.800 --> 45:57.720
Yeah, I think it says too much, like, hey,

45:57.720 --> 45:59.760
I'm going to go settle in for a while.

45:59.760 --> 46:00.520
I'm getting cozy.

46:00.520 --> 46:01.000
Yeah.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.240
Yeah.

46:02.240 --> 46:04.320
If you need me for, like, the next 20 minutes,

46:04.320 --> 46:05.240
you know where I'll be.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.080
A Kindle, absolutely not.

46:07.080 --> 46:08.960
Because if you drop that between your legs,

46:08.960 --> 46:11.560
it electrifies the water, and the water might splash up

46:11.560 --> 46:13.200
and shock your gooch.

46:13.200 --> 46:15.080
Yeah.

46:15.080 --> 46:15.880
That's science.

46:15.880 --> 46:16.440
Science.

46:16.440 --> 46:22.600
That's scientific dispiration of electricity

46:22.600 --> 46:25.560
immersed in water splashed on gooch.

46:25.560 --> 46:27.640
The reason I would never use a Kindle in the bathroom

46:27.640 --> 46:29.960
is because you're paying a lot of money for that

46:29.960 --> 46:31.280
and for that service.

46:31.280 --> 46:33.800
And then that's always going to be your poop Kindle.

46:33.800 --> 46:36.760
I like to leave my iPhone 4 outside of the restroom

46:36.760 --> 46:38.000
whenever I use it.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
You stay right here.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.200
I'll be right back.

46:40.200 --> 46:42.520
I don't let anybody steal you.

46:42.520 --> 46:44.120
Make sure you scream.

46:44.120 --> 46:45.600
Do not wander off.

46:45.600 --> 46:46.160
I don't know.

46:46.160 --> 46:52.040
I think that it's fine to bring material in, but I don't do.

46:52.040 --> 46:54.000
How much time are you spending in this bathroom?

46:54.000 --> 46:55.840
I don't do anything in the restroom.

46:55.840 --> 46:58.440
And let's try and keep this as not gross as possible.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.800
When I'm in the restroom, I'm doing restroom stuff,

47:00.800 --> 47:02.040
and I'm out.

47:02.040 --> 47:04.920
I don't bring my game boy in there.

47:04.920 --> 47:05.920
I don't bring my game boy.

47:05.920 --> 47:08.400
I don't have a Big John's bathroom buddy,

47:08.400 --> 47:09.560
or whatever it's called.

47:09.560 --> 47:10.320
I just get in there.

47:10.320 --> 47:14.880
I get it done, and then I leave, and I go do other things.

47:14.880 --> 47:17.560
Justin's laughing because Justin fucking posts up,

47:17.560 --> 47:19.760
like brings the TV in.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.080
Barricades the door.

47:21.080 --> 47:22.680
He's like, I'm watching Man Vs. Food.

47:22.680 --> 47:25.120
I can't leave, Middle Ep.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.760
I'm halfway through this through.

47:26.760 --> 47:28.080
What am I supposed to do?

47:28.080 --> 47:30.240
Man Vs. Food would be an ironic choice,

47:30.240 --> 47:32.960
because you're always just losing it at that point.

47:32.960 --> 47:35.640
God bless it.

47:35.640 --> 47:41.200
There should be a show called, Seriously, Man Vs. Food.

47:41.200 --> 47:43.400
That's just him on the restroom after he just

47:43.400 --> 47:46.680
ate 36 chili dogs.

47:46.680 --> 47:47.480
That's the thing.

47:47.480 --> 47:49.760
They never tell you about Man Vs. Food.

47:49.760 --> 47:53.960
In the end, the food always escapes the fight.

47:53.960 --> 47:56.360
And when it doesn't, God help us all.

47:56.360 --> 48:00.280
Can that show just be called, Food Vs. Man?

48:00.280 --> 48:01.160
Food strikes back.

48:01.160 --> 48:06.400
In other news, TV personality, Adam, what's his face,

48:06.400 --> 48:08.360
has died today.

48:08.360 --> 48:12.640
And in the challenge of Man Vs. Food, food is won.

48:12.640 --> 48:13.240
Yeah.

48:13.240 --> 48:15.360
He tried to eat all the spaghetti,

48:15.360 --> 48:19.200
and then on the terlet, he just died from it.

48:19.200 --> 48:24.880
I feel like, if I don't bring something into the bathroom,

48:24.880 --> 48:28.400
what I'm saying is, I really want

48:28.400 --> 48:29.680
to focus on what I'm doing.

48:29.680 --> 48:30.480
Yeah, you should.

48:30.480 --> 48:31.680
I'm going to focus on the sin.

48:31.680 --> 48:32.600
Yeah.

48:32.600 --> 48:35.160
How are you not like, buckling down, and just turning?

48:35.160 --> 48:36.160
Get in, get out.

48:36.160 --> 48:37.880
What kind of dirty boys are you?

48:37.880 --> 48:40.040
I like to distract myself from that evil,

48:40.040 --> 48:42.560
and you guys like to really like, kick me with a pin.

48:42.560 --> 48:44.360
I run my bathroom time like a fucking pit crew.

48:44.360 --> 48:45.320
I am in and out.

48:45.320 --> 48:48.720
I got a stopwatch going, zzz, zzz, zzz, and I'm out.

48:48.720 --> 48:52.040
What happens down there?

48:52.040 --> 48:55.680
I don't know what kind of situation you have.

48:55.680 --> 48:59.120
It just doesn't happen, you know?

48:59.120 --> 49:02.720
You got to make it happen, and I can't.

49:02.720 --> 49:08.560
I feel like magazines are the epidurals of the bowel movement

49:08.560 --> 49:09.440
process.

49:09.440 --> 49:12.400
You need to make sure you're dilated comfortably.

49:12.400 --> 49:13.880
Right, exactly.

49:13.880 --> 49:15.460
You guys both work from home, though,

49:15.460 --> 49:18.680
so what you don't get is that moment when somebody walks

49:18.680 --> 49:19.880
up and grabs the doorknob.

49:19.880 --> 49:22.880
Oh, Travis, listen, we're on the same team here.

49:22.880 --> 49:26.120
Don't try and change my allegiance.

49:26.120 --> 49:28.200
I live in constant fear of that, even

49:28.200 --> 49:29.640
when I'm at home by myself.

49:29.640 --> 49:31.600
You know what the worst word in the English language

49:31.600 --> 49:32.600
is to say out loud?

49:32.600 --> 49:33.080
Occupied?

49:33.080 --> 49:35.000
Occupied, yeah.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.600
Because it always is said in fear.

49:37.600 --> 49:41.280
Please, no, my penis is out of everything.

49:41.280 --> 49:44.800
You would see everything if you came in here.

49:44.800 --> 49:47.360
And now you know that I was making deuce.

49:47.360 --> 49:49.240
Everything.

49:49.240 --> 49:51.160
And the worst is when that happens,

49:51.160 --> 49:53.440
and then they stay outside the door waiting for you

49:53.440 --> 49:54.840
to come out.

49:54.840 --> 49:57.320
And you have to quietly open the door and say.

49:57.320 --> 50:01.840
Can we agree that the proper etiquette, if you try a knob,

50:01.840 --> 50:02.640
and it is locked.

50:02.640 --> 50:03.960
You run away as fast as you can.

50:03.960 --> 50:08.560
I feel like it is your social responsibility,

50:08.560 --> 50:13.120
social contract, to not be in that person's field of view.

50:13.120 --> 50:16.000
They have to think it was a ghost or the wind.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
They cannot something must have fallen against the doorknob.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.960
I will sometimes go 30 feet away,

50:20.960 --> 50:24.880
wait till I hear the door open, and then re-approach.

50:24.880 --> 50:26.280
Just to say, I don't know.

50:26.280 --> 50:26.800
You flank it.

50:26.800 --> 50:27.880
You come in from the left.

50:27.880 --> 50:31.640
There was some real dickhead over here grabbing doorknobs.

50:31.640 --> 50:35.240
He ran away, twisting his mustache.

50:35.240 --> 50:36.680
You know, there was a moment when

50:36.680 --> 50:39.040
we were in Chicago for Griffin's birthday

50:39.040 --> 50:40.760
and doing the live show last year,

50:40.760 --> 50:42.840
where we went to that brunch place,

50:42.840 --> 50:45.000
and the men's restroom was occupied.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.680
And one of the hostesses was like,

50:46.680 --> 50:48.360
oh, you can just use the women's.

50:48.360 --> 50:51.440
And I was like, OK, because I felt pressured to do it.

50:51.440 --> 50:54.120
So I'm in the women's, and I'm using the bathroom.

50:54.120 --> 50:58.520
And somebody does the knob when I'm in the women's restroom.

50:58.520 --> 50:59.920
And so then I come out, and there

50:59.920 --> 51:02.000
is a lady standing there waiting to use the restroom.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.360
Travis, do you know where your folly was in there?

51:05.360 --> 51:08.840
When you went in the fucking women's restroom, what?

51:08.840 --> 51:10.520
The hostess told me to do it.

51:10.520 --> 51:12.960
Yeah, you should say, oh, thanks for the advice, hostess,

51:12.960 --> 51:15.760
fuck right off.

51:15.760 --> 51:19.240
I have my own restroom that I'm supposed to use.

51:19.240 --> 51:21.840
There are labels on these doors for a reason.

51:21.840 --> 51:23.920
What I find funny is that we live in fear of that,

51:23.920 --> 51:27.000
when the worst that will happen if somebody opens.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.960
If you somehow, if they get past the lock, which,

51:29.960 --> 51:31.480
let's be honest, sometimes they do.

51:31.480 --> 51:33.880
Sometimes you're dealing with a Danny Ocean out there

51:33.880 --> 51:36.160
that can get in the restroom.

51:36.160 --> 51:38.760
The worst that's going to happen is they look in.

51:38.760 --> 51:40.380
They see that you're in the restroom.

51:40.380 --> 51:42.220
They probably don't even hang out long enough

51:42.220 --> 51:44.720
to see your thighs.

51:44.720 --> 51:47.440
Oh, no, they close that door so quick, it's amazing.

51:47.440 --> 51:49.320
But it's like I live in fear of the fact

51:49.320 --> 51:50.920
that somebody's going to come in and be like,

51:50.920 --> 51:53.400
let me see your butthole.

51:53.400 --> 51:54.880
Spread your cheeks.

51:54.880 --> 51:56.320
Let me see everything.

51:56.320 --> 51:58.920
That's not, show your world to me.

51:58.920 --> 52:00.560
That's not going to, that just won't happen.

52:00.560 --> 52:02.560
Get out of here, Dave Matthews.

52:02.560 --> 52:03.880
Let's be honest, though.

52:03.880 --> 52:06.200
Let's get real frank here.

52:06.200 --> 52:08.840
On those rare occasions when you do open the door on somebody

52:08.840 --> 52:11.200
using the bathroom because they forgot to shut it,

52:11.200 --> 52:13.920
isn't the thought that goes through your head, gotcha.

52:13.920 --> 52:18.360
Hey, gotcha.

52:18.360 --> 52:19.180
Seen it all.

52:19.180 --> 52:20.720
My thought is, well, now it's sad

52:20.720 --> 52:22.080
that I'll never be able to acknowledge

52:22.080 --> 52:23.120
their existence again.

52:23.120 --> 52:25.960
Yeah, well, we had a good run,

52:25.960 --> 52:27.360
but I can never see you again.

52:27.360 --> 52:29.120
Well, guess I got to quit this job.

52:29.120 --> 52:30.160
Bye, everybody.

52:30.160 --> 52:31.200
Bye, everybody.

52:31.200 --> 52:32.120
Ask Tom.

52:33.040 --> 52:34.920
Put me in my number two weeks notice.

52:34.920 --> 52:39.960
I want to hear Kevin's last question.

52:41.480 --> 52:43.160
But first, some quick housekeeping.

52:44.360 --> 52:45.280
We have forums.

52:45.280 --> 52:46.800
They're Maximumfun.org.

52:46.800 --> 52:51.120
You can contact us, M-B-M-B-A-M at Maximumfun.org.

52:51.320 --> 52:54.400
If you have a question, something you need advice on,

52:54.720 --> 52:56.000
we are there for you.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.680
We usually record Sunday mornings.

52:57.680 --> 53:03.480
So, you know, send them before that if that's when you need advice.

53:03.480 --> 53:07.080
We are talking about the Jumbotron, Maximumfun.org.

53:07.080 --> 53:11.880
We've got shirts there at Maximumfunstore.com.

53:11.880 --> 53:14.080
And if you keep an eye on that store,

53:14.080 --> 53:16.000
I heard here the next week or so,

53:16.440 --> 53:20.240
there may be a new M-B-M-B-A, I'm sure, for you to buy and enjoy.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.560
Ooh, that sounds nice.

53:22.560 --> 53:26.560
Maybe something related to America's favorite

53:26.960 --> 53:29.280
chicle based product.

53:29.280 --> 53:30.600
I don't know what you mean.

53:30.600 --> 53:31.760
Like chicle?

53:31.760 --> 53:32.640
Like chicle.

53:32.640 --> 53:33.680
Un chicle?

53:33.680 --> 53:37.880
Yeah, we got live show announcements coming soon.

53:37.880 --> 53:43.000
We're in the planning stages of four all across this great country of ours.

53:44.280 --> 53:46.920
So hopefully those will all come to fruition.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.040
We're talking about four shows before,

53:49.040 --> 53:52.040
but basically within the next nine months to a year.

53:52.120 --> 53:56.040
So we'll have some announcements about those soon.

53:56.280 --> 54:01.800
And Travis, you were talking about our thousandth tweet is coming up.

54:01.800 --> 54:04.240
Yeah, I think what it's going to be is we're going to keep an eye

54:04.240 --> 54:06.480
on the M-B-M-B-A-M hashtag

54:07.360 --> 54:11.560
and whoever can dig up the most obscure, funny quote

54:11.560 --> 54:13.000
that makes us really happy.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.800
You're going to be our one thousandth tweet.

54:14.800 --> 54:18.600
So we'll make sure to pimp your shit on our thousandth tweet.

54:18.600 --> 54:20.880
So start talking on Twitter as much as you can.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.000
We won't talk. Put it like that.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.520
No, yes.

54:24.520 --> 54:25.840
Yeah. And don't put it at us

54:25.840 --> 54:27.640
because then only people who listen see it.

54:27.640 --> 54:29.960
Share it. Share with the world.

54:29.960 --> 54:32.160
Just put that M-B-M-B-A-M hashtag in there.

54:32.160 --> 54:35.520
Speaking of, I want to give a big shout out to DuckLips513

54:36.000 --> 54:40.120
