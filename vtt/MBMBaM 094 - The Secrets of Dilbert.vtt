00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:49.680
What's up, sports fans? You've tuned in once again to Hoop Bros. It's a slam dunk.

00:50.560 --> 00:55.200
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy, and I've got March Madness. It's clinical.

00:55.920 --> 00:59.120
I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy, and I'm taking it to the hole.

00:59.120 --> 01:07.200
What? Oh, sorry guys. I think I'm just coming down with a touch of basketball fever.

01:09.760 --> 01:13.120
You have to say your name. Griffin McElroy. I have basketball fever.

01:15.520 --> 01:19.680
Griffin McElroy, basketball fever man. It sounds more like a confession than AA.

01:21.680 --> 01:25.680
So we are the Hoop Bros. It's March Madness, and that means only one thing.

01:25.680 --> 01:32.960
This is just layout central. I hear the Blue Devils got a stern talking

01:32.960 --> 01:36.320
to by the Tar Heels last night in terms of basketball points.

01:39.120 --> 01:49.680
Who was dunking more sweet on which one? Willis went balls to face on Reginald in dunk mode.

01:49.680 --> 01:57.360
Wow. Just full on dunking right on him. It was a nasty, he jumped from the half court,

01:57.360 --> 02:02.160
and he stretched his arms and legs out, and all the Monstars grabbed onto his legs,

02:02.160 --> 02:05.360
but he still stretched his arm all the way out. You're drifting into space jam.

02:06.080 --> 02:10.560
Space jam again. What is it? We talked about how we're not gonna let you on Hoop Bros anymore

02:10.560 --> 02:16.480
if you keep talking about space jam. But this wasn't a work of Looney Tunes fiction. This was...

02:16.480 --> 02:20.720
Looney Tunes fact. Looney Tunes fact. Travis,

02:23.200 --> 02:26.720
let's take it to Trav's Corner. This is our weekly segment where Trav gets

02:26.720 --> 02:32.080
pretty deep into basketball, b-ball strategy. Trav, how important is it to get more points

02:32.080 --> 02:37.920
in the other team? I've been doing a lot of number crunching, and my statistics look like

02:37.920 --> 02:42.320
it's real important. Travis, now can you tell me what's a good score to have and get?

02:42.320 --> 02:45.840
Uh, I don't know, like 12? 12 is...

02:45.840 --> 02:51.360
13? Maybe like 13 points? I don't mean to, I know that you are our

02:51.360 --> 02:55.440
resident math magician, but it seems like there are a lot of numbers higher than that.

02:55.440 --> 03:00.240
Yeah, but that's like just an improbability that someone would score higher than 13. Do you know

03:00.240 --> 03:07.440
how hard you have to be working to score more than 13 points? Maybe Wilt the Stilt Chamberlain

03:07.440 --> 03:11.760
could do it, but that's it. Pretty sure he scored a hundo in one game.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.840
What?! He got like a hundred points in one game.

03:13.840 --> 03:17.280
And then he immediately died. Yeah, like his heart exploded.

03:18.320 --> 03:24.800
Now, Travis, points in basketball are awarded by judges. How can you really wow them to make

03:24.800 --> 03:29.200
sure they're assigning you a lot? It's all about the flair, Justin. It's all

03:29.200 --> 03:35.040
about your spin and twirl as you do it. You can't just put the ball into the hole. You have to like

03:35.040 --> 03:38.640
spin around when you do it, maybe stick out your tongue. Just a little bit of flair to make you

03:38.640 --> 03:48.080
stand out. The new rule in the NBA is that if you yell your catch phrase mid-dunk, you get bonus

03:48.080 --> 03:53.600
points for that. Or maybe you just yell like, dunking donuts! Or something like draining them!

03:54.320 --> 03:59.920
And then you drain them. People like that. People like draining them. That's Kobe's.

04:01.920 --> 04:07.600
Does Kobe say draining them, or is he like- He doesn't have to now because it's become so

04:07.600 --> 04:11.680
much a part of his repertoire that people say it for him. Oh, like everybody else yells it.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.480
Yeah, the other four guys on the team just sing it out like a chorus.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.800
It's beautiful, actually. It's haunting. It's actually really touching.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.920
It's actually pretty lovely. That sounds actually really nice.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.320
But to be fair- Oh, sorry guys, that's the buzzer. That does it for the Hoop Bros.

04:26.880 --> 04:32.000
For this week, don't want to get a technical foul, gotta pass the show over

04:32.000 --> 04:35.840
to my brother. My brother and me will see you next week.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.520
Oh, that was a good bit.

04:37.520 --> 04:41.280
That was a real solid goof we just did for a long time.

04:41.280 --> 04:45.280
I'm committing us actually to doing it every week in March.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.440
Oh, you want to do Hoop Bros from now on?

04:47.440 --> 04:50.720
Hoop Bros from now on, every week in March is Hoop Bros week.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.720
This is my brother, my brother and me, actually. It's not really-

04:55.280 --> 04:57.840
Well, the other show was a sports show that we do.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.320
This is the other side of the coin.

05:00.320 --> 05:03.600
It's the flip side of that coin. It's my brother, my brother,

05:03.600 --> 05:06.880
me and the advice show from the modern era. We've already introduced ourselves,

05:06.880 --> 05:09.440
so I feel like we should get right into the advice.

05:09.440 --> 05:16.560
I feel like it's a bizarro world and Hoop Bros is the polar exact opposite of what our show really is.

05:17.280 --> 05:23.760
Except for the fact that pretty much all the insight it espouses is useless.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.440
Yeah, except for that.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.720
Except for it's complete just sort of useless.

05:30.720 --> 05:36.960
Somewhere in an alternate universe, there is three McElroy brothers that are just so on point with sports.

05:37.840 --> 05:42.160
There might be some in this universe, they just don't have a podcast inside our podcast.

05:45.760 --> 05:50.320
Hey, about two months ago, I moved into a new apartment. Great spot, love it.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.880
But a few weeks ago, someone moved into the apartment above me.

05:52.880 --> 05:56.560
He's loud and obnoxious, stomps around whenever he walks,

05:56.560 --> 06:02.160
and on an almost daily basis has loud, drunken conversations with his friends really late at night,

06:02.160 --> 06:04.560
often until two or three in the morning.

06:05.520 --> 06:09.200
I have to live here for the rest of the year, and he'll be here for at least as long.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.440
What is the etiquette in this situation?

06:11.440 --> 06:14.640
Should I march up there and tell him to keep it down?

06:15.360 --> 06:17.440
Should I leave a note in his mailbox?

06:17.440 --> 06:20.160
Or should I just leave it alone and get used to it?

06:20.160 --> 06:21.920
Can't sleep in San Francisco.

06:21.920 --> 06:32.720
Do you know that there is a body, an agency, that will just take care of this for you?

06:32.720 --> 06:32.960
Really?

06:32.960 --> 06:33.920
What do you call them, Griffin?

06:33.920 --> 06:35.600
I call them the police.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.240
Griffin, stop snitching.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.080
We talked about this.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.880
Snitches get stitches, Griffin.

06:42.880 --> 06:48.160
There are a number of horrible crimes that you can do in this world, and snitching is high up on them.

06:48.160 --> 06:52.880
But keeping me up at two in the morning after I just drank a bottle of red wine because I watched

06:52.880 --> 06:56.000
a really sad episode of The Bachelor, guess what?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
That's the highest crime in the land.

06:58.000 --> 06:58.800
But here's the thing.

06:58.800 --> 07:04.480
Here's the problem with this, and people have dealt with this for ages, for eons,

07:04.480 --> 07:08.400
and that is once you call the police, now you're that dude,

07:08.960 --> 07:11.280
and you have to keep living in that same apartment underneath the other guys.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.760
Do you think that the police, when the police roll up and they're like,

07:13.760 --> 07:18.400
hey, Roger down in 403 just called us up, what a little bitch.

07:18.400 --> 07:22.720
No, they say like you got complaints from your neighbors, but like clearly it's the guy below them.

07:22.720 --> 07:23.680
It's the guy below them.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.120
They don't have to know which neighbors.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.840
You have plausible deniability.

07:27.840 --> 07:28.880
What if it's the guy above them?

07:28.880 --> 07:30.240
You don't know it's the guy below them.

07:30.240 --> 07:30.960
It could be anybody.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.000
It could be the guy adjacent.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.440
Why would you assume people below you are calling the cops?

07:35.440 --> 07:40.800
I rarely even think about people below me as even existing in the world.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.080
I live in a duplex.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.440
So if I get called up, the fucking jig is up.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.600
He's like, fucking Roger, you bitch.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.920
I'll walk next door and be like, hey, Carl, what gives?

07:50.560 --> 07:52.080
Is this you or Rosario?

07:52.080 --> 07:53.200
Who fucked me?

07:54.720 --> 07:56.400
Thought we were gonna stop snitching.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.560
Thought we had agreed upon that, but I guess that's not our policy now.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.600
Whatever you do, do not leave them a note in the mailbox.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.560
It gives me chills.

08:06.560 --> 08:07.360
That gives me chills.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.240
Don't do that ever.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.680
Tape a note to their car.

08:09.680 --> 08:10.000
Excuse me.

08:10.000 --> 08:10.800
Hey, excuse me.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.520
Excuse me.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.960
Sorry to have a good day, smile.

08:14.160 --> 08:18.640
I'm just, oh, three o'clock's pretty late to be chatting with your bros, don't you think?

08:18.640 --> 08:20.080
If you could just keep it down.

08:20.640 --> 08:27.920
We used to get notes from the woman who lived in an apartment building Sidney and I used

08:27.920 --> 08:28.720
to live in.

08:28.720 --> 08:36.080
And she was also an insane person who was living in the building at a discounted rate

08:36.080 --> 08:38.000
because she would take care of odd jobs.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.960
Sort of like a dumb superintendent, a less than super superintendent, if you will.

08:43.920 --> 08:50.000
And I remember in one of her classic notes, she left it taped to our door in this sort

08:50.000 --> 08:54.400
of insane person scrawl with like backwards R's and whatnot.

08:56.160 --> 09:00.000
It just said, I will take your Christmas tree for you.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.760
This was in January.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.440
I will take your Christmas tree away for you.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.640
What do you want?

09:06.640 --> 09:12.080
There was no instruction on how the handoff would happen if she was just going to break

09:12.080 --> 09:13.360
in the back door.

09:13.360 --> 09:16.160
What I'm building a Christmas tree friend and I need yours.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.520
I'm so hungry, hungry for trees.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.640
I'm making pine soup.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.560
Please give me your trees.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.880
Was she affronted by the fact that it was after Christmas and then you still had your

09:26.880 --> 09:27.440
tree up?

09:27.440 --> 09:28.480
Is that what the situation was?

09:28.480 --> 09:28.960
No way.

09:28.960 --> 09:29.680
She could have seen.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.000
I mean, I guess it was in the window, so maybe she did see.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.040
But it was like January four, I mean, it was nothing.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.920
Yeah, guys, it's, it is, what is it now?

09:37.920 --> 09:40.240
March three, take them down.

09:40.240 --> 09:45.760
And there are like, my neighbors still have Christmas lights up like on their house.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.360
Now, do you think that's confusing?

09:47.360 --> 09:49.760
Cause it's like Austin and there is no change of seasons.

09:51.760 --> 09:55.680
So there's like waiting for Easter and we're waiting for the next big holiday, I guess.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.760
I think it might be more that it's awesome.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.560
And so people are kind of zany and crazy.

10:00.560 --> 10:04.640
They're kind of zany and like, yeah, this is my only source.

10:04.640 --> 10:05.920
He's trying to keep Austin weird.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.280
It's my only source of lighting now.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.760
Guys, I love Auntie Mame as much as the next dude.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.800
You got, and I love, I love Free Spirits.

10:15.840 --> 10:21.120
You're taking, every time you use up Christmas magic in February or March, that's Christmas

10:21.120 --> 10:23.360
magic that we will not have come December.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.040
It's not a renewable resource.

10:25.040 --> 10:25.760
No, it's not.

10:25.760 --> 10:29.600
The government has some reserves, but we can't really get a release that on the year without

10:29.600 --> 10:30.240
a Christmas.

10:30.240 --> 10:35.920
This is why I'm such a strong, I'm such a strong proponent of drilling in Alaska for

10:35.920 --> 10:37.120
more Christmas juice.

10:37.120 --> 10:37.600
Yeah.

10:37.600 --> 10:37.760
Yeah.

10:38.480 --> 10:38.880
Me too.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.240
They're like, it's going to harm the wildlife.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.520
And I'm like, fuck the wildlife.

10:41.520 --> 10:42.320
I need my eggnog.

10:42.320 --> 10:42.480
Yeah.

10:42.480 --> 10:46.720
Ironically, it will kill many, many reindeer to do so.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.160
Highly toxic to them.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.320
But I think, I think it's worth it.

10:52.320 --> 10:57.840
Did you guys see, I think it was last month that there was a big Christmas spill in the

10:57.840 --> 10:58.160
ocean.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.280
Oh my God.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.720
Yeah, and they were just like, there were just birds washed up on the shore, just covered

11:02.720 --> 11:03.760
in tinsel.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.760
Was it, was it a Hallmark rig?

11:05.760 --> 11:06.000
Yeah.

11:06.720 --> 11:07.040
Yeah.

11:07.040 --> 11:07.920
So sad.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.360
The SS Hallmark.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.240
They're so wildly irresponsible with their Christmas sauce.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.440
The boats are so old.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.640
That's the problem.

11:18.640 --> 11:23.120
They've been using them since, I don't know, since Dudley Moore found Santa again.

11:23.120 --> 11:24.080
I forget when that was.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.640
It was a long time ago though.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.240
Guys, how about a Yahoo answer?

11:28.240 --> 11:29.600
Yes, please.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.320
That was creepy.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.720
This one was sent in by Graham Wetterburn.

11:34.720 --> 11:35.680
Thank you, Graham.

11:35.680 --> 11:36.400
It's by Yahoo.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.120
Good name, Graham.

11:37.120 --> 11:42.800
Yeah, it's by Yahoo Answers user Raj, who asks, why does Dilbert's tie curve up?

11:44.880 --> 11:50.160
Scott Adams said in an interview with groundreport.com, no one really knows, including me.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.040
Dilbert started as a doodle before I knew he would be famous.

11:53.040 --> 11:56.320
I don't remember what I was thinking the day I decided to curl his tie up.

11:56.320 --> 12:01.360
WikiAnswers' search tells me, A, it's a metaphor for his inability to control his environment.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.440
B, he's just glad to see you.

12:03.440 --> 12:09.040
But IMO, a mini hurricane surrounds him and keeps flapping his tie, smile face.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.200
To all Dilbert fans, what do you think?

12:13.360 --> 12:14.080
Oh, God.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.360
Who thinks about Dilbert this much?

12:17.920 --> 12:21.920
Apparently not even Scott Adams could be troubled to figure out why his dumb tie is standing up.

12:21.920 --> 12:22.720
Man, when you ask this-

12:22.720 --> 12:24.400
He's too busy hating women.

12:24.960 --> 12:25.600
Yeah.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.960
When you ask the sexist creator of Dilbert, like, hey, what's the deal with the tie?

12:28.960 --> 12:30.480
He's like, fuck it, I don't know.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.960
Stop pursuing that line of questioning.

12:32.960 --> 12:33.200
Yeah.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.360
Why is his tie sticking up?

12:35.360 --> 12:39.360
Because she didn't cook it long enough in the kitchen.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.400
Oh, Scott Adams.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.040
Oh, shit.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.800
Why is his tie sticking up?

12:44.800 --> 12:47.360
Why are you not having kids?

12:47.920 --> 12:50.880
Get out of my face, Scott Adams.

12:50.880 --> 12:51.440
Hold on.

12:51.440 --> 12:54.080
I really think this Scott Adams character is going somewhere.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.160
I mean, why don't you workshop it and come back?

12:58.400 --> 13:00.800
Justin's going to go workshop his Scott Adams character.

13:00.800 --> 13:04.720
Travis and I are going to goof on the original cue, but Justin's going to go off.

13:07.040 --> 13:11.920
You guys go forward and I will dip back in a little bit with some more Scott Adams.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.040
Let me give you a setup.

13:13.040 --> 13:16.320
It's Scott Adams in a pet shop that's run by a woman.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.200
Okay, good, good, okay.

13:19.200 --> 13:26.720
I also like the person who ever said number two, he's just happy to see you.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.560
Dilbert's just got himself a tie bow in there.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.280
Nothing weird.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.800
Nothing weird about that.

13:30.800 --> 13:31.920
He's got a tie erection.

13:32.800 --> 13:38.640
I think it's suggesting that Dilbert is so bound to his job that his tie has literally

13:38.640 --> 13:43.840
become a part of his body and when blood flow increases to the tie, it forms a fully erect

13:43.840 --> 13:44.320
phallus.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.640
And he has a really curvy wiener.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.040
Yeah.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.360
Well, that's just like a hook, like a fish hook wiener.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.600
It's just a half chub.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.800
If it was a full chub, his tie would be sticking straight out from his neck.

13:56.320 --> 13:59.200
Why are these poodles so expensive?

13:59.200 --> 14:01.120
Must be your time of the month.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.120
Well, there he is.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.040
Hey, Scott Adams, ladies and gentlemen.

14:05.040 --> 14:05.920
Closer.

14:05.920 --> 14:06.480
What's next?

14:07.200 --> 14:08.480
What's our next scenario?

14:10.480 --> 14:14.800
Scott Adams is an astronaut going to the moon with a female astronaut.

14:14.800 --> 14:18.960
Okay, I'll check you in a bit.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.480
This is the kind of question, right, that somebody doesn't just, like, ask.

14:22.480 --> 14:23.360
Like, that they-

14:23.360 --> 14:24.560
Well, they did ask it.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.680
No, but I'm saying, like, this isn't like, oh, just popped in my head what's up with

14:27.680 --> 14:28.400
Dilbert's tie.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.600
Like, they've stared at Dilbert like every Sunday.

14:31.600 --> 14:35.520
Here's a few excerpts from my thesis, my master's thesis.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.160
What's the deal with Dilbert?

14:38.160 --> 14:40.480
I mean, there are a couple of answers from people who say,

14:40.480 --> 14:44.800
uh, uh, Adams has also hinted that the tie may just be displaying an aversion to him.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.400
We may never truly know why Dilbert's tie does what it does.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.000
Dilbert's tie doesn't do shit.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.360
It's not a real thing.

14:51.360 --> 14:54.560
A dude draws it and he doesn't know why he does it that way.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.960
Like, there's no deeper truth.

14:56.960 --> 15:01.040
I just heard Justin inhale sharply, which makes me think he's ready to give us his Scott

15:01.040 --> 15:02.160
Adams Goes to the Moon goof.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.120
Why are you even coming, Angela?

15:05.120 --> 15:07.840
The moon's made of green cheese, not malls.

15:07.840 --> 15:14.960
Yeah, I feel like your first opus was a little stronger.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.320
And he's also starting to mutate a little bit into the Wolfman.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.160
I'm starting at 1.7.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.000
Can I have, can I have one more?

15:22.000 --> 15:22.720
Oh, God.

15:22.720 --> 15:23.840
I need to redeem myself.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.640
Scott Adams is getting married.

15:26.640 --> 15:27.440
Okay, got it.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.400
Yahoo Answers user question mark responded to me.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.600
I think that Dilbert's tie curves up to give him some individuality.

15:33.600 --> 15:38.080
He works at one of those office settings where he is really just another number and paycheck.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.120
Nobody's special.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.360
He could replace it any time and nobody would notice.

15:41.360 --> 15:45.280
I think the curve of his tie makes him stand out, even though nobody really comments on it.

15:45.280 --> 15:47.360
Hey, I think you're projecting a little bit, bro.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.120
Maybe just a touch?

15:49.760 --> 15:53.280
And maybe Dilbert's there and Angela and Accounting just doesn't want to talk to him,

15:53.280 --> 15:56.000
even though he's a super nice guy and he offered to make her dinner.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.320
And that's why his tie curves up.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.040
It's hard, man.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.600
He just gets repressed by his triangular boss.

16:01.600 --> 16:05.040
And his dog talks, which is pretty cool.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.920
His dog talks and his cat is like an evil scientist.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.280
I haven't read it in a while.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.640
Yeah, it's been a while.

16:10.640 --> 16:13.680
But there's an intern or something and they're real.

16:13.680 --> 16:17.280
Do you remember we used to have that Dilbert screensaver and-

16:17.280 --> 16:20.080
Yeah, the Dilbert desktop games.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.320
Man, when I was nine, that was a jam.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.920
Yeah, we played some real dumb shit.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.600
Hey Justin, you got that goof ready for us?

16:26.640 --> 16:29.280
For all that you are and all that you will be

16:29.280 --> 16:33.280
and all that we will be together, I do.

16:33.280 --> 16:37.520
I want you to get in the kitchen and make me some hamburger helper.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.160
Scott Adams.

16:42.800 --> 16:43.300
Shit.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.040
Is this the first libel we've ever done?

16:47.600 --> 16:50.160
Nah, it's definitely a libel.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.400
But Scott Adams is listening to this right now thinking,

16:52.400 --> 16:53.920
how did I get on that podcast?

16:53.920 --> 16:54.960
It's probable.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.280
I don't remember doing this.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.680
It must have been another misogyny bender.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.120
Another loss weekend.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.600
Another weekend lost to hating women and myself

17:06.640 --> 17:11.360
and loving television and loving making subpar comics.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.760
I'm gonna cut out that last bit.

17:13.760 --> 17:14.800
That's too mean, Justin.

17:15.360 --> 17:15.680
Okay.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.160
What?

17:16.160 --> 17:17.360
Dilbert is not subpar.

17:18.080 --> 17:18.480
Thanks.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.040
Thanks for-

17:19.040 --> 17:19.680
Thanks, Griffin.

17:20.240 --> 17:20.880
You complete me.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.440
Hey, I have a problem with people taking me seriously.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.360
And it has a lot to do with how I look.

17:27.360 --> 17:29.120
But I have a baby face.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.800
You got baby face?

17:30.800 --> 17:31.760
Baby face.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.640
I can't not say baby face like the way we sound.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.720
I have a baby face.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.360
I typically get carded for R-rated movies

17:39.360 --> 17:43.760
and at the hospital I work at, clients always call me kiddo.

17:43.760 --> 17:44.160
Oh, no.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.120
Buddy or something like that.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.280
Sport, tiger.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
They also tend to question my, I almost said existence.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.200
That's not what he said.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.360
They tend to question, but they're not that old.

17:57.360 --> 17:58.960
They tend to question my experience,

17:58.960 --> 18:01.680
even though I have been at my job for eight years.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.400
I've tried growing a beard, but it comes in very patchy.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.320
Any suggestions?

18:06.320 --> 18:08.160
That's from Darling Doctor.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.440
Well, I know the obvious answer.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.320
What's that, Travis?

18:12.320 --> 18:14.560
You need a sweet ass scar across one eye.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.240
Yeah, cut yourself on the face.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.080
You're gonna need a wicked, like,

18:19.600 --> 18:22.960
something like I got this in the jungles of the Congo kind of scar.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.520
Mm-hmm, something brutal.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.520
Yeah, so you can go with that.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.360
And you're a doctor, so you got a steady hand.

18:29.360 --> 18:29.920
Go to town.

18:30.880 --> 18:34.480
You can also, with some baby powder in the hair

18:34.480 --> 18:39.840
and a stipple brush, make a pretty convincing aging makeup.

18:39.840 --> 18:42.160
Look at, take a Benjamin Button, for example.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.640
He was not really an old man.

18:45.760 --> 18:46.080
What?

18:46.640 --> 18:47.920
Yeah, I know.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.880
So if you can get some of that,

18:50.880 --> 18:52.640
some of whatever they were doing.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.600
I do not understand it, but whatever they were doing,

18:55.600 --> 18:57.760
there's a way to make yourself look older.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.520
So it sounds like you're saying the answer,

18:59.520 --> 19:02.720
as to many problems, the answer is movie magic.

19:02.720 --> 19:05.040
Just stipple it a little bit.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.800
Do you stipple, Darling Doctor?

19:07.360 --> 19:08.160
Do you stipple?

19:08.160 --> 19:09.600
Have you tried stippling?

19:09.600 --> 19:11.680
Did you even consider trying stippling?

19:11.680 --> 19:14.640
Maybe like different grades of stipple brush.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.640
Hey, here's a freebie, by the way, guys.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.760
Don't pay $3 for a stipple brush.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.160
Get an air conditioning filter and cut it into cubes.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.200
Yeah, silly bitch.

19:25.760 --> 19:26.720
God damn it.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.400
All your money on stipple brushes, down the drain.

19:30.400 --> 19:34.480
I see people fucking just going bankrupt

19:34.480 --> 19:36.400
buying stipple brushes and foam wedges.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.000
And then they're just standing by the side of the road.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.680
And yeah, their fake beard looks great,

19:39.680 --> 19:42.480
but there's signs like, I stippled myself out of a job.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.520
You don't need to go buy a box of foam wedges.

19:45.520 --> 19:49.360
I'll just buy a Tempur-Pedic mattress and cut it up

19:49.360 --> 19:52.080
and then use the, you can get like 10,000 wedges

19:52.080 --> 19:53.120
out of one mattress.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.880
Lifetime supply.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.160
Lifetime of it.

19:56.160 --> 20:00.240
Basically, so aging makeup, movie magic,

20:01.040 --> 20:04.320
there's two, scar, that's three.

20:04.320 --> 20:07.760
Man, I feel like we're being super helpful today.

20:07.760 --> 20:10.480
Well, you could just start using words like 23 skidoo

20:10.480 --> 20:12.240
and calling other people kiddo.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.360
Maybe walk with a cane.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.400
Wait a minute, a cane is good.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.200
I like that.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.880
But they might think you have scoliosis.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.160
You could go house.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.840
No, you could go full on house.

20:22.480 --> 20:22.640
Yeah.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.720
No one calls Dr. House kiddo.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.280
No, they don't.

20:25.280 --> 20:28.560
They're too afraid of his mean ways.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.640
You're gonna have to go full on house.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.160
You gotta go just like House did it.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.480
I bet that's like, doctors are just like sick of that comparison.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.120
Like people like rolling up to the hospital and be like,

20:39.120 --> 20:41.520
so which one of you guys is like the house of the different?

20:41.520 --> 20:42.880
I'm just like, God, no one's house.

20:42.880 --> 20:43.920
It's not a real thing.

20:43.920 --> 20:44.800
It's not a real thing.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.280
If you did that for like a day, you get fired forever.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.080
Because the one thing-

20:48.080 --> 20:49.760
He just takes pills all the time.

20:50.320 --> 20:54.800
If there's one thing hospitals love more than a guy who cracks them all,

20:54.800 --> 20:57.920
it's a guy who doesn't get sued to do oblivion every other week.

20:58.720 --> 21:03.120
Can you put phone books on your feet and walk around?

21:03.920 --> 21:04.320
Okay.

21:04.320 --> 21:08.960
Well, then they call you old elephant foot.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.400
That might look kind of ridiculous.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.880
Can you get a long trench coat?

21:12.880 --> 21:15.440
And sit on a short person's shoulders.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.360
You get another young looking doctor and you guys team up.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.080
Oh my God.

21:20.080 --> 21:24.320
Because then you would be tall as two short doctors,

21:24.880 --> 21:28.160
but you would also like have the brain of two doctors.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.080
You would be the smart,

21:30.080 --> 21:34.480
that he'd be whispering up to you like, check his blood and bones.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.960
Oh, and you can say like, I need to consult a surgeon

21:36.960 --> 21:39.040
and you just like duck your head inside your jacket.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.560
And you put your head back up and you say,

21:40.560 --> 21:45.440
don't worry, my dick is a surgeon or so I've been told.

21:48.720 --> 21:51.440
And now he's ready to operate is the rest of that.

21:51.440 --> 21:51.680
Yeah.

21:51.680 --> 21:57.120
That's the, the, the, the cherry on top of that fucking yucky Sunday.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.640
It sounds like you're setting up, like,

21:59.680 --> 22:02.960
you need to start doing some experiments with like chemicals and stuff.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.600
And you're going to get yourself into a big situation.

22:05.600 --> 22:06.640
And you're like, I want to be big.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.160
Is that how big happened?

22:08.160 --> 22:09.520
No, big wasn't chemical based.

22:09.520 --> 22:10.000
Okay.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.080
But I'm, I'm telling you, I'm taking the non.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.440
It was nuclear, nuclear radiation.

22:13.440 --> 22:13.920
Zartan.

22:16.320 --> 22:16.720
Yeah.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.000
Zartan is a real.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.440
You're talking about a real life.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.320
Chemicals are real.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.200
That's, that's good.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.000
Chemicals are real.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.280
You're just, and maybe it's a movie starring Timothy Daly.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.320
I can see him in it.

22:26.320 --> 22:26.800
Okay.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.960
And he mixes up the chemicals and it makes him look older.

22:28.960 --> 22:32.080
See, I see this as a book that Travis has written and it's called

22:32.080 --> 22:34.880
Chemicals Are Real Science by Travis McElroy.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.840
It's almost as good as his book about basketball.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.760
All you want to know about science,

22:39.760 --> 22:42.240
but we're too afraid to ask because it's fucking stupid.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.560
I feel like we've given you some really good hope.

22:49.200 --> 22:49.360
Yeah.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.960
I mean, I feel like you've got enough.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.320
I don't know why you're still bothering us.

22:52.320 --> 22:55.280
Cause I feel like we, we really gave you some action items.

22:55.280 --> 22:56.080
Some take homes.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.080
You guys want another, you know, another Yahoo.

23:00.080 --> 23:00.240
Yeah.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.280
Give me somebody else to help.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.400
I already helped that guy.

23:02.400 --> 23:02.720
Yeah.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.520
This one was sent in by Eric Leiden.

23:05.520 --> 23:06.000
Thank you, Eric.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.040
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Sarah Sparks, who asks,

23:09.040 --> 23:12.720
why did most of my friends turn into whores when we got into middle school?

23:13.280 --> 23:13.760
Oh no.

23:14.800 --> 23:15.600
Oh, golly.

23:17.680 --> 23:18.160
That's it.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.080
Is that the whole question?

23:20.080 --> 23:20.560
Oh no.

23:20.560 --> 23:20.640
Okay.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.920
Um, I know.

23:25.520 --> 23:25.840
Listen.

23:25.840 --> 23:26.160
Really?

23:26.160 --> 23:35.520
When you, when you hit 11, it is just, you just go full bore now.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.400
You don't have a choice in the matter.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.240
You just go full bore.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.520
Is it 11?

23:41.520 --> 23:42.080
Yeah.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.440
11's the new 17.

23:43.440 --> 23:44.400
That's like the saddest thing.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.960
11's the new 15.

23:46.960 --> 23:53.600
Like, like just like 15 year olds in our age, 11 year olds just ramp it, ramp it up.

23:53.600 --> 24:01.120
They ramp it off of a cliff in the, in the sex, sexually irresponsible canyon.

24:01.120 --> 24:05.600
This, see, this is one area where I agree with Rick Santorum.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.240
Let's lock our preteen girls in cages.

24:08.240 --> 24:08.480
Yeah.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.640
Well, your own, not other people's.

24:12.640 --> 24:13.520
No, no.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.320
Don't come into my house and lock my family in cages.

24:16.320 --> 24:20.480
That's my daughter and I will lock her in a cage to preserve her.

24:20.480 --> 24:25.200
Kids grow up too fast, but you can stunt that if you have them in a cage in which they have

24:25.200 --> 24:26.320
to remain permanently hunched.

24:26.320 --> 24:30.000
Because if you put them in like a round cage, they're going to grow round.

24:30.000 --> 24:30.640
It's really awesome.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.320
That's, Travis, it's not like foot binding.

24:32.320 --> 24:33.360
What are you talking about?

24:33.360 --> 24:36.880
No, it is like, you know, like you grow like a cucumber in a bottle and you get a bottle.

24:36.880 --> 24:37.040
Yeah.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.960
You put a kitten in a mason jar.

24:38.960 --> 24:39.520
Uh-huh.

24:39.520 --> 24:39.840
Yeah.

24:39.840 --> 24:40.400
I feel you.

24:40.400 --> 24:40.640
Don't do that.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.560
That's stupid, but I feel you.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.400
What you got to do is you got to black out.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.960
You got to SOPA their like Wikipedia.

24:46.960 --> 24:50.560
Because that's how you learn like what a boner is now.

24:50.560 --> 24:52.560
Is that how kids are learning about it?

24:52.560 --> 24:56.560
When you're nine and you get your first boner, the boner fairy visits you.

24:57.120 --> 24:57.920
You know what you do?

24:57.920 --> 25:01.440
You'll hop on Wikipedia and you look up a Wikipedia entry that somebody else wrote.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.680
People are getting boners at nine?

25:06.320 --> 25:08.640
How are you this ignorant about this topic?

25:08.640 --> 25:10.160
No, you're saying nine?

25:10.160 --> 25:10.560
Yeah.

25:10.560 --> 25:18.080
Yeah, according to Wikipedia, boner is a slang term for an erection of the penis.

25:18.080 --> 25:21.040
Or a Zamboni ice resurfacing vehicle operator.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.400
What is going on down there?

25:24.400 --> 25:26.880
Or a jazz trombonist.

25:28.640 --> 25:29.680
Yes, that's one of them.

25:30.880 --> 25:34.880
Or a blunder, which is really funny and I wish we said that more often.

25:34.880 --> 25:41.680
But I'm saying if you don't lock your daughter up before she learns all this stuff,

25:41.680 --> 25:43.200
then you've made a terrible boner.

25:44.240 --> 25:48.880
Yes, she'll start dating a boner or worse, a boner.

25:51.440 --> 25:56.240
And you'll live to regret it.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.640
Get it, lock them in a cage.

25:59.360 --> 26:00.800
Before they make a boner boner.

26:00.800 --> 26:07.440
Yeah, and then at 18, you release them into the world, just completely uneducated,

26:07.440 --> 26:09.840
and then they're just so happy and blissfully ignorant.

26:09.840 --> 26:12.480
Yeah, they don't need to know about all this stuff that we know about.

26:12.480 --> 26:18.240
God, do you think, oh, I wish I could go back to the day before I knew how everything worked down there.

26:18.240 --> 26:21.840
Yeah, there's a lot more mystery and a lot more shit.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.280
I just thought it was movie magic.

26:25.520 --> 26:26.800
Like me, myself, and Irene.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.840
Here's a little factoid for you guys.

26:29.840 --> 26:39.440
Did you know that there was an American comic strip about a guy in an ark full of animals

26:39.440 --> 26:45.840
written by Mort Walker, creator of Beetle Bailey, and the name of that strip was Boner's Ark.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.520
It stopped running in 2000.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.520
I can't imagine why.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.920
What could have undone this hilarious?

26:55.920 --> 27:02.640
This hilarious, ironically, that is why Dilbert's tie curves because of his Boner's Ark.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.960
Stupid, dumb show.

27:07.680 --> 27:12.240
Can we just say that boners are a high schooler's game?

27:12.960 --> 27:14.400
That's when you should start meddling.

27:14.960 --> 27:19.440
In middle school, you should be more worried about being absolutely and completely ostracized.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.240
Can we also agree that by the end of college,

27:22.240 --> 27:24.960
you should have had all the boners you're ever going to have?

27:24.960 --> 27:26.800
You've punched your boner card.

27:26.800 --> 27:29.520
You get one more free boner, but then that's it.

27:29.520 --> 27:30.880
And that's for your wedding night.

27:32.560 --> 27:38.560
It's like that Eddie Murphy movie, A Thousand Words, where he only has that many till he dies.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.480
It's like that movie, Brewster's Millions.

27:41.600 --> 27:45.520
He has a million boners, and if he doesn't have them all in one day,

27:45.520 --> 27:47.200
then he'll never have another boner again.

27:48.160 --> 27:51.200
Also, the boners belong to an old man before him.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.000
He's borrowing them.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.440
He bequeathed his boners.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.600
It's like that movie on borrowed boners.

27:56.480 --> 27:59.520
It's a good thing they didn't cast a feeler in in that flick,

27:59.520 --> 28:01.120
or it would have been a short film.

28:01.120 --> 28:01.840
You know what I mean?

28:04.160 --> 28:06.560
Because that's something you could say to make people think you're older.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.520
Also, I've used all my boners up.

28:11.520 --> 28:12.640
Should work pretty well, too.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.040
My natural boners.

28:15.040 --> 28:15.760
My God-given boners.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.760
I've used all my natural boners.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.680
Do you have any pills for that?

28:20.720 --> 28:22.400
I don't want to have another one or I'll die.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.080
This is basically what I'm saying to you.

28:24.080 --> 28:24.560
So I'm so scared.

28:24.560 --> 28:27.680
I only have so much blood, and I need to use it in my essentials.

28:32.560 --> 28:37.520
Hey, how do I handle the immediate derision I get?

28:37.520 --> 28:44.720
The, well, FU snob derision I get when people find out I don't own a TV.

28:44.720 --> 28:45.920
Hey, I love TV.

28:46.480 --> 28:52.160
I watch TV on my laptop, which often means I see new episodes before they air on real TV.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.600
So I'm beating them at TV.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.840
I shamelessly invite myself over to friends' houses to watch things,

28:57.840 --> 29:03.600
and I will never ever give up my love for admittedly crappy TV medical dramas.

29:03.600 --> 29:06.000
Is it possible, is it permissible to yell,

29:07.520 --> 29:09.600
FU, I'm gonna go watch House-

29:09.600 --> 29:10.960
So much swearing.

29:10.960 --> 29:11.680
So much swearing.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.640
So much swearing.

29:12.640 --> 29:16.960
FU, I'm gonna go watch House now at these people and storm off.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.880
Is there any way to defend myself as a normal member of society who loves

29:20.880 --> 29:24.880
pop culture and just happens to consume it over Wi-Fi rather than cable?

29:24.880 --> 29:27.520
And that is from, I kid you not, the future Mrs. Gregory House.

29:29.280 --> 29:36.160
You are riding on the vanguard of the new television movement.

29:36.160 --> 29:37.920
All those other people, they're the old guard.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.600
You don't have to worry about them anymore,

29:39.600 --> 29:43.200
because they're gonna die soon, like the dinosaurs.

29:43.200 --> 29:46.480
You are in the fast lane of the information superhighway,

29:46.480 --> 29:50.560
and they're over in the far right lane with their blinker on for like three miles.

29:50.560 --> 29:54.160
Why are you even worried about the judgment of these dinosaurs?

29:55.120 --> 29:56.000
They're extinct.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.040
They're turning into coal and diamonds all around you.

29:59.040 --> 30:04.640
Which will then go to power your internet, your coal-powered internet.

30:04.640 --> 30:08.080
Coal-fired internet, the way grandpa used to make it.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.760
I do not like people who don't have TVs.

30:13.760 --> 30:14.880
Now, stick with me.

30:14.880 --> 30:15.600
Now, stick with me.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.040
No, I don't have anything.

30:19.040 --> 30:19.440
Okay.

30:19.440 --> 30:22.480
I do want to say that everybody should have a TV.

30:23.440 --> 30:27.760
I have like four, so if you want one, I'll just give you one of mine.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.960
But you do need a TV.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.760
How else can you get emergency broadcast messages?

30:31.760 --> 30:34.800
I have three TVs in my living room right now.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.680
Jesus Christ.

30:35.680 --> 30:40.000
One for cable, one's hooked up to my video game system,

30:40.000 --> 30:41.840
and one's just sitting under a table.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.800
It's just there in case one of the other ones stops working.

30:44.800 --> 30:48.480
I haven't had cable in a long, long, long time, but I have a TV.

30:50.000 --> 30:50.800
Is that weird?

30:51.360 --> 30:53.120
No, because you need it for video games.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.080
I need it for video games.

30:54.080 --> 30:59.440
So you're just saying it's less to you about it being a facilitator for TV watching.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.360
You just want people to have a TV.

31:01.920 --> 31:02.800
Yeah, yeah.

31:04.240 --> 31:05.920
I trust someone more if they have a TV.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.840
Why do you think you're so cool?

31:07.840 --> 31:09.280
TVs are cheap and they're great.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.320
Just get one.

31:10.320 --> 31:13.760
I know that we're going completely against what this person just asked us.

31:13.760 --> 31:14.240
I disagree with you, too.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.680
But I kind of feel the same way.

31:15.680 --> 31:17.760
When someone tells me, like, oh, I don't own a TV.

31:17.760 --> 31:18.880
I say to them, go, why not?

31:19.600 --> 31:20.320
Just get one.

31:21.840 --> 31:27.920
But I can do all the things I do on my TV on my computers.

31:27.920 --> 31:28.640
No, but you can't.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.240
Here's one thing that I'm going to hit you with.

31:30.240 --> 31:30.720
Okay.

31:30.720 --> 31:34.880
No one's ever said, like, let's have a communal experience.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.000
It's Christmas Eve.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Let's all watch It's a Wonderful Life.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.040
Please gather around my 13 inch MacBook Air screen.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.960
No, this is going to be very cozy.

31:42.960 --> 31:45.600
Flip side of that, nobody's ever said, I don't want to watch the latest episode

31:45.600 --> 31:46.400
in The Bachelor.

31:46.400 --> 31:50.240
Let's pick up my TV and put it in the bed with us.

31:50.240 --> 31:50.880
And we'll just lie.

31:50.880 --> 31:51.920
That's why you have both.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.640
Yeah, right.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.040
Nobody's like, hey, I'm throwing a big party at my house.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.040
We're all going to watch the Oscars on my computer.

32:00.080 --> 32:04.080
You are setting yourself up to be a lonely heart because you can't have someone over

32:04.080 --> 32:05.280
to watch House with you.

32:05.280 --> 32:10.080
I want you to live a life that is full of love and companionship.

32:10.080 --> 32:14.400
And you can't do that when you're squinting at your MacBook.

32:14.880 --> 32:15.600
Here's what you need.

32:15.600 --> 32:20.080
You need to get yourself that S-video cable and just like connect your laptop to a TV.

32:20.080 --> 32:21.360
But they don't have a TV.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.280
They need to get the TV too.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.280
So you need to get the S-video cable and the TV.

32:25.280 --> 32:29.040
This is the most streamlined advice you've ever given anyone.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.200
Just go buy a TV.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.760
If you buy a TV, you get one.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.040
You get one.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.840
Just if you have one, then you, oh, you know what?

32:38.720 --> 32:40.240
Just tell people you have one.

32:40.240 --> 32:40.740
Yeah.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.240
It's like, yeah, spot checking the neighborhood.

32:44.240 --> 32:44.640
Right.

32:44.640 --> 32:45.200
TVs.

32:45.200 --> 32:45.840
Yeah, I love them.

32:45.840 --> 32:46.640
I can't get enough.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.720
Because if you can't say that to people, then you really are.

32:50.720 --> 32:53.840
You don't have a TV because of because you like how that sounds.

32:53.840 --> 32:54.960
You don't want to be that guy.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.720
Oh, that guy can clean off.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.600
I don't care about him.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.400
I'm glad you're not that guy.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.440
It sounds like you're not that guy.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.040
And I'm proud of you for not being that guy.

33:03.040 --> 33:05.760
Yeah, no, it doesn't sound like you're that guy, but don't be that guy.

33:06.640 --> 33:09.840
Do you think that there were those guys like 50, 60 years ago who were like,

33:09.840 --> 33:11.280
oh, I don't even own a radio.

33:12.880 --> 33:17.520
Yeah, I see those where I see those wavy lines going through the air.

33:17.520 --> 33:18.720
And I'm like, no, thanks.

33:18.720 --> 33:19.600
Keep on going.

33:19.600 --> 33:20.080
What is that?

33:20.080 --> 33:21.680
You can keep your little orphan Annie.

33:21.680 --> 33:22.240
I don't need it.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.600
Oh, that's the Gutenberg press.

33:24.160 --> 33:24.640
No, thanks.

33:24.640 --> 33:25.520
Handwritten for me.

33:26.320 --> 33:30.080
Yeah, I'll just let me get I got a lot of illuminating to do.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.440
I'll catch you guys next week.

33:31.440 --> 33:35.120
Like, hey, you know what I do when I need a new TV?

33:35.120 --> 33:35.600
What's that?

33:36.320 --> 33:37.440
I talk about soap.

33:37.440 --> 33:47.520
Let's go to the money zone.

33:51.520 --> 33:55.520
First trip to the money zone is being paid for by Sean Andrich,

33:55.520 --> 34:02.800
who's wishing wishing Carla Andrich a very, very happy birthday.

34:02.800 --> 34:08.320
Technically on Sunday, but we're celebrating it today.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.200
Observed.

34:09.200 --> 34:13.040
It's like it's like a birthday time warp because when you listen to this,

34:13.040 --> 34:17.360
it will be Monday, but we are recording this on your birthday.

34:17.360 --> 34:18.320
So it's earnest.

34:18.320 --> 34:21.360
It's earnest birthday wishes, and I think you'll be able to feel that.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.360
Yeah, she's happy birthday.

34:23.360 --> 34:28.400
Okay, she's a dedicated MBMB AM listener and all around awesome lady

34:28.400 --> 34:33.360
who's working on her second novel, loves their two awful cats and is a quote.

34:33.360 --> 34:38.160
I don't want to say this, but I'll say it, and she is a total tiger in the sack.

34:38.160 --> 34:38.560
All right.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.680
Okay, so now the Internet knows that.

34:42.480 --> 34:47.520
Now I know that more importantly, the Internet can go fuck itself with a with a pylon.

34:47.520 --> 34:50.960
I don't care about the Internet, but I care about me having to hear those words.

34:50.960 --> 34:55.600
Hey, I just want to wish her happy birthday and tell the world she rocks my socks.

34:55.600 --> 35:00.880
I know Griffin won't do songs for non-corporate entities, but maybe Justin will.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.920
Okay, will Justin?

35:06.160 --> 35:12.640
Carla's so beautiful to Sean.

35:12.640 --> 35:13.360
It's great.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.320
Can't you see?

35:16.720 --> 35:18.800
Yeah, something about being a tiger in the sack.

35:18.800 --> 35:27.360
She's a tiger in the sack, and now that's something Justin has to know.

35:27.360 --> 35:27.920
That's great.

35:28.480 --> 35:37.040
You are so beautiful to Sean.

35:37.040 --> 35:44.160
We really got to find a way to get you on Fox on all of the songs we do from now on.

35:44.160 --> 35:46.160
You've got a beautiful set of pipes.

35:46.800 --> 35:47.440
Yeah, that was amazing.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.480
It's yeah, thank you.

35:51.200 --> 35:51.920
Thank you very much.

35:51.920 --> 35:58.960
And also, we, of course, want to take a moment to love our friends at Stack Soap.

36:00.080 --> 36:04.720
Stack Soap is you ever have those stupid slivers as I call them?

36:04.720 --> 36:08.080
Trademark where you use the bar soap and it's down to a dumb little sliver

36:08.080 --> 36:10.400
you have to throw away or slip on and die.

36:10.400 --> 36:11.680
Well, not anymore.

36:11.680 --> 36:18.400
Stack Soap is a soap that has a special divot in it that lets you slide the stupid sliver

36:18.400 --> 36:19.360
right into it.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.560
And so you never end up having to waste it.

36:25.200 --> 36:29.280
If you pledge $10, you're going to get six bars of Stack Soap.

36:30.400 --> 36:34.400
And those kids, you only have nine days to get in on that deal.

36:34.400 --> 36:41.200
And if you go now, you could possibly be the 1000th donor.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.360
Can you believe that?

36:43.360 --> 36:44.080
It's amazing.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.200
Like you guys, you're incredible.

36:45.760 --> 36:48.000
Yeah, you guys are really actually crazy for soap.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.920
But I'm super happy that they have-

36:49.920 --> 36:51.200
Why you guys love soap so much.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.200
It is dirty.

36:54.240 --> 36:58.880
But go to stacksoap.com, bid on some soap, get in on the ground floor of soap.

36:58.880 --> 37:08.480
Now, part of our ongoing engagement with Stack Soap is that Griffin has been working on a

37:08.480 --> 37:09.600
jingle for them.

37:09.600 --> 37:10.720
Griffin, how is that coming?

37:10.720 --> 37:10.960
Bad.

37:11.920 --> 37:13.120
People have been asking about it.

37:13.120 --> 37:13.600
Actively poorly.

37:13.600 --> 37:17.680
I'm on the West Coast, West Coast, Left Coast this week.

37:17.680 --> 37:24.560
People have said, I know John Drake, who works at a music video game company-

37:24.560 --> 37:26.000
Can't say which one, but-

37:26.000 --> 37:26.640
Can't say which one.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.000
The only one that hasn't shut down.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.160
Yeah, he works at Harmonyx said, I can't wait.

37:32.160 --> 37:35.520
We're all losing our minds over here at video games.

37:36.160 --> 37:41.120
Everyone at video games can't wait for Griffin to drop this hit.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.760
And he knows everybody.

37:45.760 --> 37:51.280
He knows Feist, he knows Ravi Shankar, he knows all the music biz.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.240
So this is kind of your shot at the big time.

37:54.240 --> 37:58.480
And I think everyone's, I think we've only got one more week with our friends at Stack Soap.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.200
So like, you really got to drop it on us.

38:02.000 --> 38:02.880
Oh, it's not ready.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.600
Okay, next, but next week-

38:05.600 --> 38:07.040
Next week it'll definitely, definitely be ready.

38:07.040 --> 38:11.040
But this week I've been thinking more about like, I got the chorus down, right?

38:11.040 --> 38:15.600
I got the, put your soap in my soap, right?

38:16.720 --> 38:17.040
Yeah.

38:17.040 --> 38:17.840
I got that part.

38:17.840 --> 38:22.000
But like the verses need something like, I've been trying to think of soap goofs.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Soap goofs.

38:24.000 --> 38:24.960
It's hard to do, isn't it?

38:25.920 --> 38:27.120
Something like, it's-

38:27.120 --> 38:28.080
Pop a bubble.

38:28.080 --> 38:28.640
Bubble bubble.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.200
I don't want to pop your bubble.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.880
It ain't no lie.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.400
And the lie would be L-Y-E.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.360
Uh huh, uh huh, yeah.

38:34.880 --> 38:35.760
Because it's not in there.

38:35.760 --> 38:36.960
There's no lie in the product.

38:37.520 --> 38:38.400
There's no lie in it?

38:39.040 --> 38:40.160
As far as I know, no.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.680
No, there's like glycerin or something.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.720
I could just do a cover of glycerin.

38:46.560 --> 38:47.200
God damn it.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.160
So, um-

38:50.160 --> 38:53.280
Don't let your skin get dry.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.440
Don't let your skin get dry.

38:58.480 --> 39:04.160
Don't let your grandpa die by slipping on a silver soap.

39:04.160 --> 39:04.800
There it is.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.600
That's, ooh, you're getting really close.

39:07.600 --> 39:08.960
I want, here's the thing.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.600
When you finally drop that, I want full production.

39:11.600 --> 39:12.800
I want layered vocals.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.080
Uh, I want, I want guitar effects.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.000
I'd like a drum track if I could.

39:18.000 --> 39:18.800
Okay, so you want me to get-

39:18.800 --> 39:19.840
Can you do the Wawa thing?

39:19.840 --> 39:20.480
I love the Wawa thing.

39:20.480 --> 39:22.880
You want me to fully garage band this shit.

39:22.880 --> 39:24.800
I just want you to garage band it.

39:24.800 --> 39:25.360
Yeah.

39:25.360 --> 39:26.400
I think everybody's ready.

39:27.360 --> 39:28.960
But anyway, that's stacksoap.com.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.120
Don't let your grandpa die.

39:31.120 --> 39:31.600
Buy Stack Soap.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.120
Don't let your grandpa die.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.760
And don't let your grandpa die before he hears

39:35.760 --> 39:38.640
one of the fine programs on the Maximum Fun Network.

39:39.280 --> 39:42.000
What if what you're about to hear about right now.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.920
Hello there, my name's Graham Clark.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.120
And I'm Dave Shumka.

39:49.120 --> 39:52.960
And together we host a podcast called Stop Podcasting Yourself.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.520
This is a file that you download from the internet

39:55.520 --> 39:57.360
and then you listen to it in your pod.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.800
What's that about, you ask?

39:58.800 --> 40:00.240
Well, who are you to ask?

40:00.240 --> 40:01.360
Who do you think you are?

40:01.360 --> 40:03.360
Yeah, get lost, bozo.

40:03.360 --> 40:06.160
We're a couple of stand-up comedians in Vancouver,

40:06.160 --> 40:07.760
British Columbia, Canada.

40:07.760 --> 40:10.400
And every week we bring a guest on the show.

40:10.400 --> 40:11.680
Sometimes they're Canadian.

40:11.680 --> 40:12.960
Sometimes they're not.

40:12.960 --> 40:14.320
Sometimes they're a ghost.

40:14.320 --> 40:17.600
It's like you're sitting in on a friendly afternoon chat.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.400
Plus we're Canadian, so you get a tax break.

40:21.600 --> 40:25.280
You can find us on iTunes or online at MaximumFun.org.

40:30.800 --> 40:33.200
One of my roommates has a tendency to be up super late

40:33.200 --> 40:34.800
talking to her boyfriend on Skype.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.560
It occurred to me.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.080
No, I'm sorry.

40:38.080 --> 40:38.800
That is Skype.

40:39.680 --> 40:43.440
It occurred to me recently that our router is in my room

40:43.440 --> 40:46.800
and I'm the only one in the house who is at all cognizant

40:46.800 --> 40:48.720
of the vagaries of home networking.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.600
Would I be, like, the biggest dick if I logged in

40:53.600 --> 40:55.760
and cut off her internet access for the night?

40:55.760 --> 41:01.600
Or is this totally justified at 3.30 in the goddamn morning

41:01.600 --> 41:05.200
when I just know that that bitch is gonna give me a migraine?

41:06.640 --> 41:09.440
The ladies are fired up this week, right?

41:09.440 --> 41:10.720
They are fired up.

41:10.720 --> 41:15.920
That's from Vivaciously Velourant for Virtual Vengeance

41:15.920 --> 41:17.440
in the Victoria.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.640
How do you know this is a lady?

41:18.640 --> 41:21.360
Vivaciously, I think, tipped me off.

41:21.360 --> 41:22.400
You know what?

41:22.400 --> 41:25.600
If someone woke me up three o'clock in the goddamn morning

41:25.600 --> 41:29.120
talking on Skype, I would melt the router down

41:29.120 --> 41:30.400
to its essential components.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.280
Forget about logging her off.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.960
I'm gonna log off the internet forever.

41:36.160 --> 41:36.720
No way.

41:38.080 --> 41:39.200
That dog don't hunt.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.000
It's not my home.

41:40.640 --> 41:41.680
I'm asleep.

41:41.680 --> 41:46.480
You could talk to her about it.

41:46.480 --> 41:47.840
Say, hey, I'm trying to sleep.

41:47.840 --> 41:48.400
Could you please?

41:49.600 --> 41:51.360
You don't have to ruin this expensive piece

41:51.360 --> 41:52.400
of internet technology.

41:53.280 --> 41:54.320
It's pretty boring, though.

41:55.280 --> 41:58.880
Well, additional details that were edited out for time

41:58.880 --> 42:00.960
is that she has talked to her and that sometimes

42:00.960 --> 42:03.680
she goes and bangs on her roommate's door.

42:05.520 --> 42:07.920
But she points out that sometimes it's late at night

42:07.920 --> 42:09.200
and you're real comfy in your bed

42:09.200 --> 42:10.400
and you don't want to get up.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.400
Just reach over, switch off the router.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.000
Those were salient details, Travis,

42:14.000 --> 42:15.360
and I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't

42:15.360 --> 42:17.120
censor them out anymore, SOPA.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.480
When I don't edit things out, I get bitched at

42:20.480 --> 42:22.400
because the questions are three paragraphs long.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.720
Yeah, but then you read them later.

42:25.360 --> 42:29.200
What part of editing for time are you unclear about?

42:29.200 --> 42:30.400
If you say them later.

42:30.400 --> 42:33.520
They got to hear it in my dulcet tones instead of yours.

42:33.520 --> 42:35.600
Right, you reworked the verbiage.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.360
It breaks it up orally.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.840
Okay, well, then if you've already talked to her about it,

42:39.840 --> 42:43.440
then yeah, I guess violence is the only answer.

42:43.440 --> 42:45.040
Is that more entertaining?

42:45.040 --> 42:46.080
Shut it down.

42:48.080 --> 42:48.720
Shut it down.

42:48.720 --> 42:49.760
Go full Gallagher.

42:50.800 --> 42:51.440
Wait, what?

42:52.240 --> 42:54.160
Full Gallagher, fucking put it on a big-

42:54.160 --> 42:55.360
You're saying Bludgematic.

42:55.360 --> 42:57.200
No, I think he's saying get up and leave.

42:57.920 --> 42:58.720
No, what?

42:59.760 --> 43:01.280
Like you would at a Gallagher show.

43:04.080 --> 43:05.200
No, I'm saying,

43:05.200 --> 43:09.680
No, I'm saying I hate these things.

43:09.680 --> 43:15.040
All the kids downloading all their pornography and Googles.

43:15.040 --> 43:18.880
Well, I've got a Google here dot.com.

43:18.880 --> 43:19.600
Smash it.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.720
Is this, was that Scott Adams pretending to be Gallagher?

43:22.720 --> 43:23.920
Or what's going on?

43:23.920 --> 43:25.520
That's Gallagher.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.360
How can you not tell that's Gallagher?

43:28.320 --> 43:29.600
It's clearly Gallagher.

43:30.880 --> 43:33.120
Do you want to hear my other Gallagher impression?

43:33.120 --> 43:33.680
Yeah, please.

43:33.680 --> 43:36.240
Is this Gallagher 2?

43:36.240 --> 43:37.360
Oh, Crikey.

43:37.360 --> 43:38.080
Wonderwall.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.240
Oh, Justin.

43:42.560 --> 43:44.320
Now do your Peter Gallagher impression.

43:44.320 --> 43:45.440
Oh, Jesus, fuck.

43:46.480 --> 43:49.120
While you were sleeping, I smashed you with a hammer.

43:49.120 --> 43:50.320
That works on two levels.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.200
Seth Ryan.

43:55.920 --> 43:56.480
Hammer.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.760
We've been going on an OC.

43:59.760 --> 44:03.920
This is the theme song to OC.

44:03.920 --> 44:05.040
He was on the OC.

44:05.040 --> 44:05.360
Sorry?

44:06.000 --> 44:06.720
Peter Gallagher.

44:07.600 --> 44:08.160
What about him?

44:09.440 --> 44:11.360
He played California Dad on the OC.

44:12.880 --> 44:14.080
Well, he was Surf Lawyer.

44:14.080 --> 44:15.600
Yeah, Surf Dad.

44:15.600 --> 44:16.640
Turn it off.

44:16.640 --> 44:18.560
Turn it off and in the morning just say like,

44:19.200 --> 44:21.280
I guess we had a ping in the middle of the night.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.160
Guess you had some latency.

44:25.280 --> 44:26.880
I guess you used up all the internet.

44:26.880 --> 44:30.400
Sounds like a hack attack to me.

44:30.400 --> 44:32.720
Anonymous came in and just stole our router.

44:33.600 --> 44:34.240
Soap-ed.

44:34.240 --> 44:35.920
I guess you got soap-ed.

44:35.920 --> 44:36.400
It happens.

44:37.120 --> 44:37.520
It happens.

44:38.400 --> 44:41.120
Maybe get politically active and stop the soaping.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.120
WikiLeaks.

44:44.800 --> 44:45.680
You got WikiLeaked.

44:46.960 --> 44:48.880
This Yahoo answer was sent in by question mark.

44:49.600 --> 44:50.400
Thank you, question mark.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.480
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Tom, who asks,

44:52.480 --> 44:57.280
does anybody else abstain from masturbation, sexual intercourse before a job interview?

44:57.280 --> 44:58.320
And if not, how come?

45:01.200 --> 45:05.360
I apply the same logic to job interviews as some sports teams do to important matches,

45:05.360 --> 45:07.040
and it has become a ritual of mine.

45:07.040 --> 45:11.600
Does anybody else abstain from masturbation, sexual intercourse before a job interview?

45:11.600 --> 45:12.880
And if not, how come?

45:12.880 --> 45:14.960
I need to take these things one at a time.

45:14.960 --> 45:17.680
First off, are people really doing that during sports?

45:18.240 --> 45:18.740
Yeah.

45:19.600 --> 45:20.240
Is that like a thing?

45:20.240 --> 45:27.920
Oh, you know, that's a huge thing for like boxers and football athletes is that you don't,

45:28.480 --> 45:32.640
you know, you don't mess around before a fight, before a big game.

45:34.080 --> 45:37.120
Is that like a full-blown barbarian thing and like it makes them hungry?

45:37.680 --> 45:41.840
Yeah, it's like you're harnessing like your primal energies.

45:42.640 --> 45:43.680
Oh, fuck.

45:43.680 --> 45:44.320
Yeah, right?

45:44.320 --> 45:45.040
It is gross.

45:45.760 --> 45:46.640
That's disgusting.

45:46.640 --> 45:48.160
They also eat a bunch of fettuccine.

45:48.160 --> 45:50.000
Wait a minute.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.200
That's just to carve up.

45:51.200 --> 45:55.840
Coach comes into the locker room, says, sorry, hey, everyone, quit jerking.

45:56.800 --> 45:58.480
Instead, let's go to the Olive Garden.

45:59.120 --> 46:01.840
Yeah, let's go get some free breadsticks.

46:01.840 --> 46:06.880
I'm going to substitute your jerking with some good, good pasta fagioli.

46:08.800 --> 46:13.040
I don't think I would ever call any pasta I've eaten orgasmic.

46:14.160 --> 46:15.920
Saying that's not a very fair trade.

46:15.920 --> 46:18.320
But that is a risk.

46:18.320 --> 46:19.840
What if the breadsticks are too delicious?

46:21.360 --> 46:21.840
I get it.

46:21.840 --> 46:22.160
Right?

46:22.160 --> 46:27.200
Fagiolis, you know, you take a bite and you said this is splendor and there's infinite of it.

46:28.080 --> 46:28.400
Whoops.

46:29.920 --> 46:30.560
Oops.

46:30.560 --> 46:31.040
What happened?

46:32.880 --> 46:34.720
I need a book to explain this to me.

46:34.720 --> 46:39.440
I'll open up Chemicals Are Real by Travis McElroy and figure out this orgasmic situation.

46:39.440 --> 46:45.280
Oh, I just thought that was to kill the, kill the sexual arousal.

46:45.840 --> 46:49.520
It's like you either think about baseball numbers or read.

46:50.880 --> 46:51.920
Chemicals Are Real.

46:54.400 --> 46:55.040
Is this a real?

46:55.760 --> 46:59.120
Fuck, I wish I'd played sports so I knew if this is a real thing and coaches were like,

46:59.120 --> 47:01.280
I want you guys horny as hell.

47:01.280 --> 47:06.160
No, I don't think a coach can like legally say that.

47:06.160 --> 47:10.000
When you are out there on that gridiron, I want you grabbing at those guys.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.160
I just want you so desperate for any sort of touch.

47:13.200 --> 47:16.400
I want you hungry for any sort of companionship or connection.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.720
I want you hungry for basketball points and some touch.

47:21.440 --> 47:23.440
I want you to just crave human contact.

47:24.320 --> 47:27.120
Some kind of affection in this cold, cold world.

47:27.120 --> 47:28.720
Here's the deal I'm going to make with you guys.

47:28.720 --> 47:31.600
First guy running in the end zone can jerk off right there.

47:34.000 --> 47:34.720
No problem.

47:34.720 --> 47:36.480
That was the original.

47:36.480 --> 47:37.600
No points until you jerk.

47:37.600 --> 47:39.200
No jerking until you point.

47:39.200 --> 47:43.200
And if you do a field goal, you can do like a bow, like through the clothes rub down.

47:44.480 --> 47:45.280
That's it.

47:45.280 --> 47:49.920
Well, that's why fucking, that's why Brett Favre sent that, sent all those ladies pictures

47:49.920 --> 47:54.080
of his member is because he was so sexually repressed for how long did he play football?

47:54.080 --> 47:55.520
I think like 53 years.

47:56.480 --> 47:58.320
He wasn't allowed to jerk it for 53 years.

47:58.320 --> 48:01.600
Then as soon as he got out of the game for the sixth time, that's why he kept quitting.

48:01.600 --> 48:04.960
He would quit football, but like I'm done for real this time, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk.

48:04.960 --> 48:06.800
Okay guys, he's back for more football.

48:06.800 --> 48:07.840
And then when he was finally done.

48:07.840 --> 48:12.720
So for real, he was like, I got to send a picture of myself to everyone.

48:12.720 --> 48:15.120
And he just immediately lost like 20 pounds.

48:15.120 --> 48:17.840
Yeah, I wasted so much time.

48:20.160 --> 48:23.520
He meant to send the picture of his wiener to his team as if to say,

48:23.520 --> 48:24.960
look how good I'm going to be at football.

48:27.280 --> 48:29.680
This is how red I am for football this time.

48:29.680 --> 48:30.880
Oh Jesus.

48:30.880 --> 48:32.880
This has been a real sports heavy show.

48:32.880 --> 48:36.720
I think I love that the gentleman who has asked this question

48:37.520 --> 48:40.080
feels the need to say like, does anyone not do this?

48:40.080 --> 48:41.280
If so, why not?

48:41.280 --> 48:43.200
Yeah, like because they're not fucking crazy.

48:43.200 --> 48:44.720
There's a billion reasons why not.

48:44.720 --> 48:48.800
Well, let's get back to the original query, which was not sports related,

48:48.800 --> 48:50.160
but for a job interview.

48:52.800 --> 48:55.520
I really want this job so bad.

48:55.520 --> 49:02.240
That's what you need, especially if you have a job interview with a member

49:02.240 --> 49:05.680
of the opposite sex or the same sex if that's your bag

49:05.680 --> 49:08.000
that you find devastatingly attractive.

49:08.000 --> 49:12.880
That's what you need is the distraction of your sexual organs telling you

49:12.880 --> 49:14.160
it's time to procreate.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.600
Yeah, that's what happened to Gilbert.

49:18.560 --> 49:20.640
He had his interview with Triangle Boss and he was like,

49:21.840 --> 49:22.560
want to have that.

49:22.560 --> 49:27.600
Yeah, he's actually always interviewing for a job to leave the crappy job he's at.

49:28.560 --> 49:31.680
So he always has a tie boner.

49:31.680 --> 49:35.920
I've interviewed for a lot of jobs and I've interviewed a lot of people for jobs.

49:36.720 --> 49:40.080
No job interview is that important.

49:40.080 --> 49:45.680
No, no job interview is worth putting your sexual tiger in a cage.

49:45.680 --> 49:48.000
What skills are you trying to improve upon?

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
Like if I don't jerk it before this, I'll be better with eye contact.

49:52.000 --> 49:57.440
Like what are you bringing to this job interview besides your boner?

49:57.440 --> 49:59.440
Employers can sense willpower.

49:59.440 --> 50:03.280
So I think that's more what it's like instead of prolonging the boner magic.

50:03.280 --> 50:07.840
I think it's more about, oh, so you didn't jerk it today?

50:08.400 --> 50:09.520
I like the cut of your jib.

50:10.160 --> 50:11.120
I'm impressed.

50:11.120 --> 50:15.360
So you're envisioning a scenario where the dude has left the interview

50:15.360 --> 50:17.440
and the boss is like, well, he's got a solid resume,

50:17.440 --> 50:20.560
but I just got the impression that he jerked it before he came here.

50:20.560 --> 50:22.240
So where's the dedication?

50:22.240 --> 50:23.600
You can, can you not tell?

50:25.680 --> 50:26.480
I can tell.

50:26.480 --> 50:27.920
I thought everyone could tell.

50:27.920 --> 50:31.600
Well, I mean, I guess if I had like 30 years experience in a job industry,

50:31.600 --> 50:34.640
you know, like in a field and I was interviewing someone,

50:34.640 --> 50:37.120
I could probably be like, oh, that's a young man who jerked it today.

50:37.120 --> 50:39.360
We don't need him here at Sears Roebuck.

50:41.280 --> 50:42.480
That's where people get jobs, right?

50:43.120 --> 50:50.400
Though I don't subscribe to this, I have heard of needing to pee.

50:50.400 --> 50:54.640
Like drinking a lot and then needing to pee when you go into a job interview

50:54.640 --> 50:58.080
or perhaps a theater audition, you use that energy.

50:58.080 --> 51:01.120
And biologically speaking, that's basically the same thing.

51:01.120 --> 51:02.800
Well, that's an old actor trait.

51:02.800 --> 51:04.000
You got pee, you use it.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.400
Several problems I have with the things you just said.

51:07.440 --> 51:07.840
Okay.

51:09.360 --> 51:10.240
Name one.

51:10.240 --> 51:12.560
Well, for one, you're saying that making pee

51:13.360 --> 51:18.800
and the beautiful magic of the human orgasm is the same thing?

51:18.800 --> 51:20.800
Yeah, yeah.

51:20.800 --> 51:22.000
It's like sneezing.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.040
Sneezing, having to pee, orgasm, they're all basically the same thing.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.960
It's your body getting evil out of you.

51:26.960 --> 51:27.120
Yeah.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.920
That's why you do it in the dark by yourself when you cry.

51:31.920 --> 51:34.640
That's what I believe, Griffin, and I have a right to believe that.

51:35.760 --> 51:36.800
Second problem.

51:36.800 --> 51:40.160
If you're in a job interview and you use that energy

51:40.160 --> 51:43.360
and you piss your pants in front of another man or woman,

51:44.720 --> 51:45.680
you don't get that job.

51:45.680 --> 51:50.720
I'm sorry you don't get that job.

51:50.720 --> 51:52.400
Unless you pee your pants, say-

51:52.400 --> 51:55.120
There's no way a sentence that starts with unless you pee your-

51:55.120 --> 51:56.240
Oh no, you can totally use it.

51:56.240 --> 52:00.640
You look at the boss and say, I am so committed to this business

52:00.640 --> 52:03.040
that I will literally pee my pants right now

52:03.040 --> 52:04.640
if that's what will get me the job.

52:04.640 --> 52:06.080
And then you do it before he can answer.

52:06.080 --> 52:08.160
I will pee my pants for this AutoZone.

52:10.320 --> 52:12.640
You pee your pants and you say, if peeing pants is cool,

52:12.640 --> 52:13.600
I'm Miles Davis.

52:13.600 --> 52:16.080
And then say, get it, like in Billy Madison.

52:16.080 --> 52:19.600
And then just stare at him until you have a-

52:19.600 --> 52:23.440
Now that only works if you're interviewing for Adam Sandler.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.520
Yeah, if you're interviewing for Adam Sandler,

52:25.520 --> 52:27.040
he's really going to appreciate that deep-

52:27.040 --> 52:30.640
The real problem is if you hold in pee and you don't jerk it

52:30.640 --> 52:33.760
and then you pee in front of your boss and you get a pee boner.

52:33.760 --> 52:34.320
Oh no.

52:35.840 --> 52:38.480
That was the grossest sentence I've ever said out loud.

52:39.760 --> 52:41.680
Yeah, I want to not do this show anymore.

52:41.680 --> 52:42.560
Can we work that out?

52:42.560 --> 52:43.920
I'm going to throw out one thing though

52:43.920 --> 52:47.680
that worries me more than this young man's philosophy

52:47.680 --> 52:49.920
on how to prepare for a job interview.

52:49.920 --> 52:52.000
I believe that in this world, there's always a balance.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.840
And for like every vegetarian,

52:53.840 --> 52:56.800
there's someone who just eats meat and stuff like that.

52:57.360 --> 52:58.720
There is someone out there who's like,

52:58.720 --> 53:00.240
oh no, before an interview,

53:00.240 --> 53:03.520
I just jerk it until I'm like fall down exhausted.

53:03.520 --> 53:04.080
Right.

53:04.080 --> 53:06.320
Like I just nonstop jerk it for like three days

53:06.320 --> 53:09.280
getting ready for any job interview or sporting event or anything.

53:09.280 --> 53:10.640
Just know like, I can't stand it anymore.

53:10.640 --> 53:14.000
I like, I like my hand and my genitals

53:14.000 --> 53:16.400
to look like I just dropped an iron on them.

53:16.400 --> 53:20.640
Like just reddened and scalding and peeling away.

53:20.640 --> 53:23.040
Bill, you look, you look pretty weary.

53:23.600 --> 53:24.640
Are you sure you're ready for this?

53:25.360 --> 53:26.960
This big game and or job interview?

53:27.920 --> 53:29.200
I've never been readier, sir.

53:30.000 --> 53:30.800
Sir, I'm so sorry.

53:30.800 --> 53:32.400
I like the cut of that young man's jib.

53:32.400 --> 53:35.040
It looks like he just furiously masturbated for 72 hours.

53:35.600 --> 53:37.600
He's committed to this AutoZone.

53:37.600 --> 53:38.160
Tantric.

53:38.160 --> 53:43.680
So that's our, that's our dumb show about Peaboners, I guess,

53:43.680 --> 53:45.040
is what Griffin has made it about now.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.880
That's the only thing anybody's going to talk about.

53:48.160 --> 53:50.080
Thank you so much for tuning in.

53:50.080 --> 53:55.360
We're here every Monday morning, morning, afternoon, you know, Mondays.

53:55.360 --> 53:55.860
Yeah.

53:56.640 --> 53:57.140
Usually.

53:58.160 --> 54:04.400
You can find us at nbmbam.com at nbmbam on Twitter or on Facebook.

54:04.400 --> 54:06.160
Just search for my brother, my brother and me.

54:06.160 --> 54:11.760
Speaking of Twitter, keep an eye on like Jesse's Twitter account, our Twitter account,

54:11.760 --> 54:14.080
and I'm sure everybody who's associated with MaxFun.

54:14.080 --> 54:17.520
We got a new MaxFun show coming up, I believe this week.

54:18.240 --> 54:19.760
We're really excited about it.

54:19.760 --> 54:20.560
You're going to love it.

54:20.560 --> 54:23.120
So just kind of keep your eyes glued to the Twitter.

54:23.120 --> 54:23.620
Yeah.

54:23.620 --> 54:24.880
Keep it, keep it locked.

54:25.840 --> 54:29.840

That's bit.ly forward slash it's what bim bam.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.400
And I've seen a lot of those this week.

55:08.400 --> 55:09.280
So thank you guys so much.

55:09.280 --> 55:09.840
Thank you.

55:09.840 --> 55:10.880
Yeah, much obliged.

55:10.880 --> 55:11.280
Thank you.

55:11.280 --> 55:12.640
We don't advertise or anything like that.

55:12.640 --> 55:15.840
So telling friends is the only way we can evangelize.

55:15.840 --> 55:19.200
So you doing that for us, it means a whole lot.

55:19.200 --> 55:22.160
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

55:22.160 --> 55:24.720
a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

55:25.840 --> 55:26.720
Are they touring?

55:26.720 --> 55:31.200
I keep seeing tweets of his and he's in different places and I think they might be touring.

55:31.200 --> 55:34.560
Well, he was doing some shows with our dear friend, John Hodgman.

55:35.360 --> 55:38.720
They were in Tucson and I think maybe LA at the Largo.

55:39.360 --> 55:41.360
Is it possible he's just a rambling man?

55:41.360 --> 55:44.080
I think that he has the look of a rambler.

55:44.960 --> 55:45.600
Yeah, yeah.

55:45.600 --> 55:46.960
So he's just a rambling man.

55:46.960 --> 55:48.640
Go see him if you have the opportunity.

55:48.640 --> 55:51.280
I haven't yet, but I bet their shows are great.

55:51.280 --> 55:53.680
Oh, oh, oh, one more thing before I forget.
