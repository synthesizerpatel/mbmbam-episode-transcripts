WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
If you change your mind

00:23.840 --> 00:25.840
Well

00:25.840 --> 00:32.560
You did it. Yes, we're here might as well do a show my brother my brother and me episode 14

00:32.560 --> 00:37.480
I never thought I never thought we'd make it this far never thought we'd get her that 13 home

00:38.200 --> 00:41.880
But we did consider it helped. I guess so I'm saying

00:43.400 --> 00:46.580
This is an advice show if you're unaware for the modern era

00:47.760 --> 00:54.580
If you're just now joining us welcome, you can hop on right now. There's no nothing you have to know already

00:54.580 --> 00:58.840
There's no continuity a room on the bandwagon Lenny a room on the bandwagon

00:59.060 --> 01:02.940
I think but at this point if you're just now listening to it, you've missed

01:03.500 --> 01:08.100
Like the getting in on the ground floor, like you can't think so

01:08.100 --> 01:13.260
I think still I think I think first 25 episodes. You're still like in the Founders Club

01:13.940 --> 01:16.240
Because I plan on stopping it episode

01:17.300 --> 01:18.300
638

01:18.300 --> 01:20.180
so in

01:20.180 --> 01:24.500
So we're we're still sort of on point there as far as that goes, okay?

01:24.700 --> 01:30.380
Well, everyone's jackets are in the mail your Founders Club Jackets Club Jackets real nice stuff

01:30.860 --> 01:35.560
Really like really just half polyester half spider silk

01:35.860 --> 01:40.780
It's like a polyester spider silk windbreaker and it's a blend windbreak

01:40.780 --> 01:45.980
We're in our face spiders though. Our faces are on the elbows like patches, right?

01:45.980 --> 01:51.340
Made a spider object. I had Travis harvest all the spider eggs. It was terrifying

01:51.340 --> 01:54.220
They incubated in his belly and then burst forth and made jackets

01:55.220 --> 01:59.900
Yeah, this was actually pretty nice. That was nice. He had this finally understood what motherhood is like

02:00.980 --> 02:02.980
Travis had an anonymous

02:03.980 --> 02:09.660
Emailer on gmail. I just want to say that Travis had to swallow a jacket pattern that we bought at Michael's

02:11.820 --> 02:13.820
Anonymous emailer on gmail

02:13.820 --> 02:19.460
Asks I received my first job out of college in March and I am still employed here

02:19.460 --> 02:23.140
I was curious when it was appropriate to ask for a raise and how to go about doing it

02:23.140 --> 02:24.800
My boss is a really nice guy

02:24.800 --> 02:30.860
But due to my social anxiety and my lack of fully understanding the intricacies of a workplace and this workplace in particular

02:30.860 --> 02:33.620
I'm afraid to bring it up. What do you suggest? I

02:34.260 --> 02:39.420
Say six months or the first time you see him bone in the FedEx lady. Hey, oh, hey, oh

02:40.620 --> 02:42.620
That's why that's time to do it

02:42.620 --> 02:48.400
Most jobs have like an annual or three months or nine month review

02:49.100 --> 02:52.580
So you might want to check and make sure that that doesn't already exist

02:52.580 --> 02:57.540
But otherwise bring it up after you've done something really great or something really wrong

02:58.620 --> 03:04.300
Start by joking about it and then the classic a classic McElroy move

03:04.940 --> 03:06.940
Suddenly the joke becomes serious

03:06.940 --> 03:11.660
Oh what happened she's like you've been joking about it and then wait hasn't been a joke

03:11.660 --> 03:14.100
I don't remember but I think he's been talking about it for a long time

03:14.740 --> 03:16.740
Which you can always see the oh

03:17.060 --> 03:19.060
You got to keep in mind. Is that company?

03:19.060 --> 03:22.460
It's worrying about spending its money on things like buying the things

03:22.700 --> 03:27.460
That it needs to keep its company running and keeping the power turned on at their big

03:28.460 --> 03:33.100
They don't give they don't give two shits if they're paying you an extra 50 cents an hour

03:33.100 --> 03:38.780
The only person who cares about that is you so, you know, don't feel like you're inconveniencing them

03:38.780 --> 03:44.220
I realize the best time to ask for race. It's after the economy is not made of toilets. What's that?

03:44.820 --> 03:51.260
How about you wait until that is happening? We're the the your your basic threat is if you don't give me a

03:52.220 --> 03:57.500
Raise I'm quitting and like in most companies. Oh god, thank Christ

03:58.340 --> 04:00.340
Finally fewer staffers

04:00.340 --> 04:06.740
I'm gonna let you in on a Travis McElroy secret when I have shitty jobs and I want to get a raise what you do is

04:07.420 --> 04:12.120
lower your standards lower their standards just start doing a really

04:12.580 --> 04:18.600
Average boring job really only commit about 65 percent every day. Okay, then one week

04:19.160 --> 04:21.240
Go in and give

04:22.540 --> 04:29.200
92 percent don't push yourself. Don't wear yourself out or anything, but comparatively it'll make it seem like wow

04:29.200 --> 04:32.400
He's Travis was beginning a lot better. Hasn't he?

04:33.060 --> 04:34.620
Get a lot better

04:34.620 --> 04:40.680
That is the time to start bringing up like raises and promotions when you really haven't pushed yourself or done anything

04:40.700 --> 04:43.580
You've just lowered their expectations so low

04:43.980 --> 04:48.940
That you can't fuck it up. I thought he got bad for a while, but he seems to be on an upswing

04:49.660 --> 04:53.740
Also, if you're if your bosses seem unreceptive to the idea of giving you a raise

04:53.740 --> 04:59.340
Don't be afraid to dip your snoot in the tiller. Let's get down in there

05:02.780 --> 05:09.100
Maybe you just need a taste just slip a couple twonkies into that back pocket. Hey, there's your twonkies

05:09.100 --> 05:11.100
Did you come in with them? It's I think so

05:14.460 --> 05:16.460
That tiller just taste

05:17.500 --> 05:18.780
the tiller

05:18.780 --> 05:25.620
Form spring asks my bim-bam. I've been chosen to be a best man in my friend's wedding and I've been trying very hard to figure

05:25.620 --> 05:27.620
Out what to say for the toast. Do you have any suggestions?

05:28.100 --> 05:29.540
thanks

05:29.540 --> 05:31.020
hmm

05:31.020 --> 05:36.340
Travis you bring sure there's like a formula to this like open with a joke. Tell a story

05:37.220 --> 05:40.220
Give a well wish for the future

05:41.220 --> 05:43.220
take a drink or

05:43.220 --> 05:48.140
Take 80 drinks beforehand and then it'll be over before you know it. I

05:49.260 --> 05:52.660
Can remember what you said in your toast? It wasn't a good toast. I

05:54.180 --> 05:58.520
Have only given one best man toast and they're divorced now. So what the fuck do I know?

06:00.020 --> 06:02.700
Apparently just you the opposite of whatever I did

06:04.220 --> 06:06.940
If you think as long as age advice, I know

06:07.540 --> 06:11.700
Here's the here's here's your does just say don't get divorced

06:11.700 --> 06:15.940
And if you do it's not on me, it's not on me drop mic

06:17.140 --> 06:23.260
But drop it hold it horizontally first and then drop it drum like you have to do with all microphones

06:23.260 --> 06:27.180
I don't even know whether it makes fans anymore. What am I gonna do with that?

06:27.740 --> 06:30.060
Didn't you mean drop it on the floor? Cuz that's what I'm doing

06:32.020 --> 06:38.360
No, just don't say anything that's gonna embarrass the newlywed couple don't ruin the wedding there it is

06:38.360 --> 06:45.040
Ruin the wedding. Yeah. Yeah, because they spent so much money. It's not your time their time. So don't ruin it by talking about

06:46.400 --> 06:52.120
Genitalia or anything? Hey my brother my brother and me. I was just wondering I'm gonna be going to college in the fall

06:52.120 --> 06:58.600
Are there any essential college things that I should do in college? Thank you. That's from Google Voice

06:59.920 --> 07:01.240
now

07:01.240 --> 07:07.160
Let's talk about Google Voice for a second. Okay, we have a we have a toll number toll will not not toll free

07:07.160 --> 07:13.360
There is a toll the toll number the toll free service costs us money and come on

07:14.360 --> 07:16.800
We're passing it down to the listener to the user

07:17.360 --> 07:24.540
So you can call that number is two zero three my bim bam one or two zero three six two six two two six one

07:25.240 --> 07:30.320
And leave a message now when you do that, you need to leave your name

07:31.040 --> 07:32.560
which

07:32.560 --> 07:34.560
This person did not do

07:34.560 --> 07:39.080
and you also need to enunciate or

07:39.840 --> 07:43.780
Don't because the transcriptions that Google Voice generates are hilarious

07:43.880 --> 07:47.480
And I'd like to take a moment to read some of these if that's okay with everyone

07:47.480 --> 07:51.200
Okay, are we gonna circle back around on this question or no, we'll come back to it

07:51.200 --> 07:56.640
But I feel this is such an important new feature to my bim bam that I think we need to bring it in

07:56.640 --> 08:00.320
Well, let me I'll tell you what, let's advise this person real quick because I want to be able to advise

08:00.320 --> 08:05.200
Okay people who have called into Google Voice via their transcriptions, okay

08:05.920 --> 08:12.840
Whoever you are just learn just learn. I swear to God if you focus on actually learning

08:13.520 --> 08:15.620
Right in your college years. You will be

08:16.360 --> 08:21.320
literally years ahead of your compatriots and then and and also

08:22.040 --> 08:26.200
On the flip side that if we can be the devil on your shoulder for a minute, just don't

08:26.200 --> 08:31.620
learn just don't don't go to classes and stuff like just do the

08:32.240 --> 08:35.520
Minimum amount you need to graduate and if you're lucky

08:36.120 --> 08:39.360
You will get to attend a party that's broken up by the FBI

08:40.200 --> 08:48.480
As I did once and that party rules or throw a beach party in your we we we used to have an annual beach

08:48.480 --> 08:53.440
Blush party where we would fill fulfill my friend Jason's apartment was saying and

08:53.440 --> 08:57.060
It's landlord love that did not get that security deposit back

08:58.000 --> 09:00.600
Or throw a computer beach party

09:02.440 --> 09:07.120
What's that everyone YouTube computer beach party whenever you're done doing this I I think

09:08.800 --> 09:10.480
You should also

09:10.480 --> 09:16.860
Figure out what you want to do early because nobody has ever switched majors in college and finished. Yep

09:17.720 --> 09:22.560
Commit to a life commit to a life now now. Okay, Google Voice

09:22.560 --> 09:26.200
So Google Voice, let's let's read some gems. Okay

09:27.080 --> 09:30.240
Hey, it's not to choose from everywhere nine

09:30.640 --> 09:37.720
Well, you know, I was really knows where you at some of that the picks up pick up the phone lines. I I wouldn't touch

09:38.500 --> 09:40.500

Think for about a month and I'm gonna be here alone here and I don't know what to do

09:46.480 --> 09:50.200
I have friends, but anyway, once I just thanks bye

09:50.200 --> 09:52.080
bye-bye

09:52.080 --> 10:00.520
Great question. Well, um, I think is he saying he's got nine girlfriends and they're some of them are going away

10:00.520 --> 10:02.520
And some of them are still gonna be his friends. I

10:03.360 --> 10:08.640
Think so and also his girlfriend is on is on his girlfriend's have a lost on

10:09.440 --> 10:15.720
Okay, so his girlfriend's like on point. She is on like 24-7 just drama

10:15.720 --> 10:21.240
It sounds like he's got eight girlfriends that are non-drama girlfriend. He's got one who's just on

10:22.280 --> 10:27.600
24-7 drama drama drama and is she the one leaving it sounds like it for a month

10:29.280 --> 10:33.760
Pick up pick up pick up pick up. So she you're calling her

10:34.100 --> 10:40.320
Okay, and she's not answering and you got eight girlfriends at home. I think you just need to stop worrying

10:40.320 --> 10:45.560
Yeah, I think you're covered. I feel like you got it with this girlfriend scenario

10:45.880 --> 10:49.600
You're like that girl a couple weeks ago who wanted to meet 11 nice guys every week

I know on my last day during my exit interview

I'll be asked why I'm leaving my issue is should I tell my horrible bosses that they suck and

15:28.180 --> 15:33.980
Everyone who works under them hates their lives or should I play nice to avoid burning bridges in case I ever need a reference?

15:33.980 --> 15:39.940
I really want to tell them what's up for the sake of my friends and co-workers. I'm leaving behind Tristan can't help them fact

15:57.700 --> 16:00.500
Or you can just subscribe to his Twitter feed he's the Triscuit

16:01.300 --> 16:02.540
so

16:02.540 --> 16:08.380
So and he'll just just ask him there. Just ask him on the Twitter. You are not gonna do yourself any good

16:08.380 --> 16:10.900
Uh, but didn't let me ask you this

16:10.900 --> 16:14.140
Did anybody do that for you Laura and the two years you're at that job?

16:14.140 --> 16:19.180
Did anybody have an exit interview where they told their bosses not to be such dill weeds? Probably not. I

16:20.540 --> 16:22.540
Can't think everybody always

16:22.780 --> 16:27.580
Fantasizes about and but you're never going to actually do it. You're gonna roll into that meeting

16:27.580 --> 16:32.860
They're gonna ask why you're leaving you're gonna say well, it was just time and you'll get out and feel like a you know

16:33.740 --> 16:38.180
You know a coward for not saying anything, but no one ever says anything. Yeah, who cares?

16:38.180 --> 16:40.180
They don't want to hear it. They really don't matter

16:40.500 --> 16:44.340
It doesn't matter what you say. I I or what you do there

16:44.340 --> 16:47.860
You don't have to have some you know grand send-off all you have to do

16:48.820 --> 16:54.140
Just dip that snoot in that tiller Wow, no reason not to do it. They're not gonna fire you

16:54.660 --> 17:00.940
Just dip your snoot in get your snoot deep down in there and just take everything that's not stapled

17:03.060 --> 17:05.060
How good you'll feel if you give a

17:05.060 --> 17:09.180
Lying in your exit interview, but you know that your pocket is full of staplers

17:09.180 --> 17:15.940
Just full of like staplers and posted notes and cash just cohort. Yes. Oh and throw this out. Why are you leaving?

17:15.940 --> 17:17.940
I could never find a stapler

17:20.140 --> 17:25.900
Good luck and just leave them with that thought and I guarantee you they will spend the next week trying to find a stapler

17:26.300 --> 17:29.860
Hey, that's great, which is correct. This is from a baby

17:30.500 --> 17:34.100
Gmail which is correct. I can be a baby a baby

17:34.100 --> 17:39.620
I couldn't care less or I could care less. I've heard both hues, but we need a definitive answer

17:39.620 --> 17:43.860
You know, it's ironic about this one. The answer is actually in the question, which is so rare

17:44.420 --> 17:46.220
You said it twice

17:46.220 --> 17:48.500
The answer of course is I I couldn't care less

17:49.220 --> 17:54.860
Feeling although it depends on what you're saying. I feel like I couldn't care less is like, you know, fuck it who cares

17:54.860 --> 17:59.340
I couldn't care less. But then if you're having a touching moment, you're like I could care less. That's

17:59.340 --> 18:04.900
I'm saying a completely different thing. Yeah, I don't care a great deal about what's going on right now

18:04.900 --> 18:08.900
There are levels of caring. Yeah, they're below the current level

18:09.740 --> 18:13.140
That I don't think you should do either. I don't think you should say I don't want

18:13.140 --> 18:18.620
I think you need to get invested in your world make a positive difference team up with us Russell Simmons

18:18.780 --> 18:21.920
We're gonna go down the river front get just pick up all the trash

18:22.540 --> 18:26.900
And that caring how about work this into your vernacular? I could care more

18:26.900 --> 18:30.820
Yeah, a few people flip the script. Okay

18:31.580 --> 18:38.900
How do you feel about dolphins? I couldn't care more gotta save them all I feel about the oil spill. I couldn't care more

18:41.900 --> 18:43.820
It hurts sometimes

18:43.820 --> 18:45.820
Why did you quit your job because I care too much

18:45.820 --> 18:51.980
I care too much as Arby's to watch you turn it into the freak show that it has become and it's supposed to be a

18:51.980 --> 18:57.300
Roast beef and roast beef related product establishment and you've turned it into something. It's just a tool

18:57.300 --> 19:03.380

But I'm coming to America for a few weeks months in September and I'm not gonna be allowed to legally drink

19:21.380 --> 19:26.700
Ah, man, what the fuck do I do? I go out like three or four times a week at the moment

19:26.700 --> 19:31.660
I can't imagine the horror of not being allowed to drink. What would you guys suggest? I do to fill my time

19:31.660 --> 19:33.660
Are you getting the bars? Okay, Simon

19:34.900 --> 19:39.100

19:44.900 --> 19:47.740

I would want to be the late-night talk show at night, I think. He records in the daytime though. Don't you know how TV works?

20:44.620 --> 20:49.580
Three or four in the afternoon and then at night he dances around the black-eyed peas and pees on himself

23:06.300 --> 23:08.020
icons

23:08.020 --> 23:14.020
You know, they're their role models for people and I get the importance of needing to know who is the best

23:14.020 --> 23:16.020
Who is the greatest?

23:16.380 --> 23:19.440
I mean Rocky Balboa has done it all

23:20.060 --> 23:26.460
Mm-hmm walking the streets playing with a ball and he does own a restaurant and like that's that's something I aspire to on a daily

23:27.060 --> 23:29.820
Is this did this person mean to write a freeform rap?

23:30.460 --> 23:36.660
It kind of sounds like it the best rap ever. Yeah, it's kind of fresh. Oh, did you hear that new bottom crawler jam?

23:36.660 --> 23:43.640
I thought he's done it all what the streets with a ball. I heard he's working with will.i.am and

23:47.540 --> 23:50.660
Walking down the hall play with a ball Clarissa plays at all

23:53.060 --> 23:59.780
Form spring asks I can't sleep. What can I do to sleep? I love these questions man. So simple so simple

23:59.780 --> 24:01.660
What do I do to sleep?

24:01.660 --> 24:08.140
Puzzles gotta get down up as a special official sponsor my brother my brother make just get a pizzazz nap

24:08.140 --> 24:09.500
You're gonna feel good

24:09.500 --> 24:14.020
you know, I always used to get tricked into that because I used to have trouble sleeping to and

24:14.780 --> 24:18.540
Mom and dad would always you know when I was little say well just lay down and close your eyes

24:18.660 --> 24:20.940
And it's as good as sleeping, you know

24:20.940 --> 24:25.660
Just lay there and rest and then all of a sudden you're waking up two hours later and you're like, oh, I fell asleep

24:26.180 --> 24:31.580
It's when you try to sleep. It's when you're thinking so hard about it. That's why you can't sleep

24:31.580 --> 24:33.860
Cuz you're trying to sleep, you know, just let yourself

24:34.540 --> 24:37.140
Fall asleep. It's much easier. Yeah

24:38.220 --> 24:40.220
if you close your

24:40.220 --> 24:44.820
You have to dream your superhero. I dream. I'm a superhero that I don't want always knocks me out

24:44.820 --> 24:48.380
I don't know why I just dream. I have superpowers and then

24:48.940 --> 24:54.820
I think it's because I want superpowers so bad that I want to really get into that dream. That's my body's like, here we go

24:55.500 --> 24:59.620
Okay, I like that. I like that. I think maybe it's because you're not stressed

24:59.620 --> 25:05.820
Because you're not stressed by anything because you're thinking about wow superpowers, that would be bomb. Mm-hmm

25:05.820 --> 25:11.060
Um, I I think if you have trouble getting to sleep, then you're not tired

25:12.300 --> 25:18.460
Maybe stay up and do something. Yeah, your life's taken away. If you don't want to sleep don't go sleep

25:18.700 --> 25:23.800
So I said I'll tell you what though it trick and you know jokingly most people would say, you know

25:23.800 --> 25:27.420
Have a couple drinks the problem is when you do that, you don't sleep as well

25:27.420 --> 25:30.660
It's the reason if you get really drunk you tend to like wake up

25:30.860 --> 25:36.200
Bright and early because you're not really sinking into that deep restful sleep that you get naturally

25:36.540 --> 25:41.060
So you might fall asleep, but you're not gonna get the same rest you would if you just you know

25:41.060 --> 25:46.100
Allowed yourself to fall asleep naturally. That's true. That's true. The drinking thing is not a good

25:46.100 --> 25:51.940
I just think you know, you know what exercise can be good if you exercise during the day. Sometimes you'll sleep better

25:51.940 --> 25:57.020
I think I bet I've heard I have no idea. How could I how could I test that theory?

25:57.020 --> 26:01.540
I don't know also. Oh don't have nightmares. Oh, yeah

26:01.540 --> 26:05.200
Yeah, do everything you are having a dream and it starts to look like a nightmare

26:05.300 --> 26:10.380
You need to just you need to inception that shit and switch it back to a good dream

26:10.500 --> 26:12.760
Well, I haven't seen inception

26:12.760 --> 26:19.620
But I think it's just Leonardo DiCaprio taking nightmares and turning them into sweet sweet dreams. He's like this place looks like a nightmare

26:19.860 --> 26:23.900
Let's get you out of here more flip this script. Look my fingers

26:23.900 --> 26:27.620
Cameron it's there. My fingers are made of rainbows. You're gonna gumdrop candy for it

26:28.060 --> 26:32.780
What are your views ass form spring on the use of recreational drugs?

26:33.660 --> 26:38.460
They're legal people who do them should go to jail. Yeah, but in jail drug. Oh, how's that?

26:38.460 --> 26:45.900
How do what are my views on robbing liquor stores? That's a crime. Well, except for Salvia Salvia is legal, right?

26:46.180 --> 26:50.620
Yeah, but don't do that cuz then you'll think the world's ending for about 15 minutes

26:50.620 --> 26:55.140
It's the worst and then you'll and then you'll wish the world of them. Yeah

26:56.660 --> 26:57.740
Wow

26:57.740 --> 27:03.540
Recreational dry. I one time I got as far as recreational drugs the one time I got high on Salvia

27:03.540 --> 27:07.940
I I was still high and my dad called and talked to my wife and

27:08.700 --> 27:15.380
Somehow the conference that my dad joked that my grandmother could see the future and I started crying because my nanny could see the future

27:15.380 --> 27:19.580
So don't so I guess what I'm saying is don't do drugs

27:20.100 --> 27:23.700
Nope, I I did Salvia and now I'm a Zen Buddhist

27:24.300 --> 27:29.700
So there yeah things happen. It was a it was a eye-opening experience

27:29.700 --> 27:35.980
I actually just got back from from the Pitchfork Music Festival where I was constantly surrounded by people

27:36.580 --> 27:40.300
who were enjoying a number of jazz cigarettes and

27:41.060 --> 27:42.700
Let me tell you

27:42.700 --> 27:46.860
That's tough man. It makes people do some crazy things out in the hot Sun

27:47.020 --> 27:50.940
You were just high on music there right and good times. I was high on music and good times

27:50.940 --> 27:57.060
I'm talking but like everyone else around me is like hey Griffin try this jazz cigarette. No, I don't I gotta be strong

27:57.340 --> 28:03.900
That's important to keep in mind when you smoke the devil grass. It might be fun for you, but everyone around you hates you

28:03.900 --> 28:07.620
Yeah, everything's like boring because it turns you into an incomprehensible

28:07.620 --> 28:13.220
Comprehensible nanny you're not funny. You're boring. Hey, you start doing that laugh thing and

28:14.260 --> 28:16.260
Slap slap that shit at you

28:16.260 --> 28:22.620
Hey, so much different from watching a drunk guy stumble around that shit's funny cuz who knows what he's gonna do. I know

28:24.140 --> 28:26.140
The weed guy's gonna ask if I've seen

28:28.100 --> 28:32.340
Fear and loathing in Las Vegas. Yes, I have and do I want to watch again? No, I don't

28:32.340 --> 28:34.340
I

28:36.540 --> 28:40.380
But don't do don't do recreational drugs cuz soon you're gonna be out on the streets

28:40.940 --> 28:48.020
Like that that lady in Los Angeles who was on the crack that came up and coughed into my mouth as I was walking on

28:48.020 --> 28:50.020
the sidewalk

28:51.460 --> 28:53.700
She stood in front of me waited for me to open my mouth

28:53.700 --> 29:01.260
Oh and then charge them $200 for it you can't salvage that day, you know that

29:04.780 --> 29:07.580
I've recently this is from Scotty who's a lady

29:08.740 --> 29:11.900
Asked us on gmail. I recently started working for my mother

29:11.900 --> 29:15.620
She's running for public office and I'm basically her personal assistant and media director

29:15.660 --> 29:17.660
Which just means I run her Facebook and Twitter

29:17.740 --> 29:22.640
The problem I'm having is that I try to take the job seriously and try to be professional while my mother does the opposite

29:22.640 --> 29:25.760
She'll poke fun at me and treat me like a 14 year old while I'm trying to work

29:25.880 --> 29:29.920
How can I try to establish a work relationship without upsetting her any advice?

29:30.320 --> 29:33.440
That's tough Scotty because that's why a lot of people don't work for their folks

29:33.440 --> 29:39.360
Or I mean, I've I've thought for a long time. I've had the opinion that working for family is not a good idea

29:40.240 --> 29:45.880
Yeah, it's just a weird way. I mean, which is probably not very helpful to you quit give up

29:45.880 --> 29:51.680
I guess I guess you should usually try to ape

29:52.040 --> 29:57.880
The spirit of the boss and like if she's not being serious about it, then you have no reason to take it

29:58.480 --> 30:02.640
Super seriously either. I mean, I I guess is the best advice I give you because that's just gonna cause

30:02.880 --> 30:05.800
You're not gonna be able to convince her to take it more. Seriously. It's her campaign

30:07.360 --> 30:09.360
Also, you run her Facebook and Twitter

30:10.440 --> 30:14.980
You have the reins to her to her social, you know face

30:14.980 --> 30:17.580
Yeah, so so you can take her hostage

30:18.460 --> 30:24.740
Basically, you can make her treat some really embarrassing shit if she if she you know plays you like a chump

30:24.820 --> 30:31.880
Yeah, say stop playing like a chump moms. Nobody gives anybody respect. You got to earn that shit. Yeah on the street

30:31.880 --> 30:37.860
Yep, I guess what I'm saying is shiver. Yeah, she found her mom to a fight in the exercise yard

30:37.980 --> 30:43.460
Yeah, I think a girl toothbrush in the ribs the old sharpened toothbrush to the ribos

30:43.460 --> 30:44.980
so

30:44.980 --> 30:46.980
Scotty stabbed your mom Tucker

30:51.340 --> 30:57.220
And have to deal with the occasional douchebag customer who thinks it's appropriate to yell and scream at me over policies to practices that aren't

30:57.220 --> 31:01.300
Mine, do you have any suggestions on tactics to respond to people like this?

31:01.300 --> 31:07.860
And do I and still keep my sense of self-worth? I have a great suggestion for you Tucker from Gmail go fetal

31:07.860 --> 31:13.400
I think Ellen you go fetal and it's like oh, what did I do?

31:13.860 --> 31:17.120
They won't know what they did and you're not gonna tell them cuz you're fetal right now

31:17.120 --> 31:21.900
And and and then and what do they have to do now? They're concerned about your well-being. That's call over your boss

31:21.900 --> 31:25.180

31:25.180 --> 31:27.800

31:52.740 --> 31:59.100
Benjamin asks via Gmail dear McElroy clan. I'm 19 and my girlfriend has just given birth to my first son Alfie

31:59.820 --> 32:01.140
Congratulations

32:01.140 --> 32:03.820
My question is how do I become fatherly?

32:03.820 --> 32:09.060
Well, I generally wear a dressing gown and slippers when lazing around and do enjoy a war

32:09.060 --> 32:14.300
There's originals along with other boiled sweets. Do I need to start smoking a pipe or wearing a tweed jacket?

32:14.300 --> 32:21.500
Yeah, I mean, I mean you jumped right over you went straight to great-grandfather Lee man. I

32:22.060 --> 32:28.460
Often tell my kids about the war. Yeah, I make him put coconut oil on my leg. Let's get rid of my varicose veins what?

32:28.460 --> 32:34.020
you confuse that like your dad is supposed to be the only trip to being a dad is to

32:35.260 --> 32:38.860
Constantly let your child know that you could beat the shit out of them at any given moment

32:38.940 --> 32:44.100
Your your old man has to be old man strong, which means that your old man is stronger than you always

32:46.100 --> 32:49.980
Like physical strength and mental strength don't hit your kids folks

32:49.980 --> 32:55.500
That's all I'm saying you need make them live in constant fear that you will yeah, and that it'll hurt so back

32:55.500 --> 32:58.740
You're so strong, right? I remember strong

32:58.740 --> 33:04.420
I remember once playing board games with the family and dad beat clue in one round

33:04.580 --> 33:12.300
Solve that shit solve that game piece in one round and that to me also is part of old man strength that idea of my

33:12.300 --> 33:15.580
Dad is a is a genius. Yeah, I was just thinking about

33:16.260 --> 33:19.140
Leading a family revolt up to that point and then dad

33:20.860 --> 33:22.860
Alpha dog

33:22.860 --> 33:25.500
I guess we're saying to be the alpha dog

33:26.260 --> 33:31.380
And don't could also enjoy the one year that you've legally been allowed to vote

33:34.420 --> 33:36.420
But congratulations on your child

33:37.340 --> 33:43.100
Also marry her come on man. Yeah, I think put a ring on it put a ring on it. You clearly like it

33:43.660 --> 33:50.660
I recently got a new girlfriend and this reform string and I've been trying to introduce my friends to her a select few all dudes

33:50.660 --> 33:54.580
Seem to be acting as if she has to play or the plague or something

33:54.580 --> 34:01.380
They don't want me coming over to their house with her anymore. What the hell happened? Oh, Jesus dude. She's terrible

34:03.380 --> 34:08.780
Can we consider the possibility that she is legitimately bubonic. Oh, she's got the boobs

34:10.140 --> 34:16.580
No, I mean like I think I'm the new coolest description of a girl ever like bootylicious. Oh, yeah girls bubonic

34:16.580 --> 34:19.940
She's a bubonic straight boom. Um, you

34:20.700 --> 34:23.660
See the boo bonds on her. She's cold bubonic

34:23.660 --> 34:29.260
I mean if your girlfriend's wearing the mask of red death you you probably well first you shouldn't be dating her

34:29.260 --> 34:34.740
But you definitely shouldn't expose your friends to her. Yeah, what kind of friend friend quote unquote friend, I guess

34:35.780 --> 34:37.180
semi friend

34:37.180 --> 34:40.300
Friend with benefits that benefit being the plague. Mm-hmm

34:41.220 --> 34:44.380
Everyone come come be around come drink up the humors

34:44.380 --> 34:49.500
Of my totally sick girlfriend. She got my girlfriend the outbreak monkey

34:50.500 --> 34:51.820
enjoy

34:51.820 --> 34:53.820
Yeah

34:54.780 --> 34:58.320
Yeah, she's bad she's bad not a good person they

34:59.500 --> 35:01.820
you got a way against like

35:02.620 --> 35:04.420
One of two things has happened either

35:04.420 --> 35:10.860
She is terrible or she makes you act like a terrible person because they like you right and they know it's gonna be awkward

35:10.860 --> 35:16.860
If they don't like your girlfriend, so one of those two things is happening. It's not it's not anything they're doing. I'm sure

35:17.820 --> 35:20.700
So you really need to like examine it take it take a step back

35:21.540 --> 35:27.340
Also, there's a chance. She's stealing stuff. She might be stealing stuff from their house

35:27.740 --> 35:33.100
Why would she do that? So next time she picks up next time she picks up anything anything?

35:33.820 --> 35:36.620
Point at her face and yell thief as loud as you can

35:36.620 --> 35:42.100
I mean see how she reacts. Yeah, AJ if she's like if she like drops it and

35:42.660 --> 35:49.140
Run just prints and throws herself through a plate glass window. You know, hey, you nailed her. You got her good one

35:50.260 --> 35:56.540
Yahoo answers user tree tops. This is an important question. We rarely deal with matters of health. Okay on this show

35:56.540 --> 36:02.180
That's so I think there's a gonna tree tops asks. Is there an easier way to lose weight than this?

36:02.180 --> 36:06.160
in the description of this question

36:07.260 --> 36:10.600
Treetops has pasted a link to the music video for rock lobster

36:19.500 --> 36:25.180
No, no, the answer is clearly no, but I mean the Atkins diet maybe but that's a temporary

36:25.900 --> 36:29.580
Ketosis only lasts for so long rock lobster. That's a deep burn

36:29.580 --> 36:37.580
a deep burn you will be reddened after that down muscles and it breaks down all the fatty acids the fatty layers and

36:38.060 --> 36:41.660
They just fall off your body. I'm a big proponent of

36:43.380 --> 36:45.380
People I feel like people are born

36:46.020 --> 36:47.740
Into their sexual preference

36:47.740 --> 36:51.460
But I'm pretty sure if you go from being a fat guy to a skinny guy

36:51.780 --> 36:55.300
Because you work out to rock lobster constantly that would make you gay

36:55.300 --> 36:59.780
I am a hundred percent sure you will be gay after that that will make you into a gay person

37:00.420 --> 37:06.900
That's the only surefire way to switch it up. I think I think to switch it back. You just have to see the expendables

37:09.940 --> 37:13.900
Well, that could go one of two ways I think there's a lot of beefcake in that movie Wow

37:14.460 --> 37:18.860
Wow, it's like a beef bakery in there. It's it's like a beef bakery

37:19.700 --> 37:21.700
making sweet beef breads

37:21.700 --> 37:23.700
Oh

37:23.900 --> 37:25.180
Delicious

37:25.180 --> 37:29.820
People often say that I look like Jack Black. Is that a good thing form spring? Nope?

37:30.660 --> 37:35.660
That's code. He's the one chubby guy in who they let be in movies

37:35.940 --> 37:38.620
So I would rather get Jack Black than Jonah Hill

37:39.340 --> 37:41.340
sure

37:42.220 --> 37:45.060
Yeah, yeah, I guess that's true but

37:45.060 --> 37:51.740
Just to protect black sucks now name one good thing Jack Black has done and in like the past five years

37:52.380 --> 37:59.860
Year one comedy movie. Maybe you didn't Wow. That was the worst thing I've ever seen I couldn't finish that movie. It was terrible

37:59.860 --> 38:03.100
I don't know. Have you seen me on your own your version?

38:04.180 --> 38:06.180
On your own. Yeah

38:06.180 --> 38:08.220
Yeah, I think I've seen that one

38:08.860 --> 38:12.380
It is better in Spanish. You really get the deep deep subtext

38:12.380 --> 38:18.020
The subtext being me you're wasting your life on year one. Oh Harold Ramis made me sad

38:18.580 --> 38:22.520
But my heart tired, I would rather get Jack Black than Chris Catan

38:23.540 --> 38:27.660
You but you do get Chris Catan not tonight because you look at Chris good hand

38:27.660 --> 38:31.540
But but with the beard, it's probably a part of that's probably been lightened, right?

38:31.540 --> 38:35.340
I actually I got told the other day I look like a grizzled Chris Catan

38:35.340 --> 38:41.580
Who's been through some shit like Chris Catan has oh

38:42.460 --> 38:46.060
Boy, it's been in some shit. I don't know if he's been through it

38:46.060 --> 38:49.460
All I can think of somewhere Chris Catan is getting more and more attractive every day

38:50.260 --> 38:56.180
It was less grizzled. Yeah as I become more grizzled like a portrait of Dorian Gray kind of thing

39:00.900 --> 39:02.220
I

39:02.220 --> 39:07.820
