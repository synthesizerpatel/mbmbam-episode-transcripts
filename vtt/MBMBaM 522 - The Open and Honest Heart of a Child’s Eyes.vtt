00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:32.960
countries

00:44.560 --> 00:48.720
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me and Advice Show for the

00:48.720 --> 00:52.880
Modern Era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy and I just punched the knows.

00:52.880 --> 00:57.840
I'm your middle brother treve Drop

00:57.840 --> 01:01.840
I'm your sweet, and I'm your, I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin.

01:01.840 --> 01:02.840
No.

01:02.840 --> 01:03.840
What?

01:03.840 --> 01:06.840
No, Justin and I were bringing like a high energy thing in, you kind of came in scary.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.840
No, I think he gave, I think he's like the bad, the wild man.

01:09.840 --> 01:10.840
I was pretty bad.

01:10.840 --> 01:11.840
Oh.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.840
Yeah, let me go at it a different way, because a lot of people when they say like, he's the bad boy, like he talks like this.

01:15.840 --> 01:20.840
But he could also be a bad boy like, I'm Griffin.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.840
Well, can you do that and then do some like sound effects, like some mouth sounds kind of thing?

01:23.840 --> 01:25.840
Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

01:25.840 --> 01:30.840
I'm Griffin.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.840
Because you know he's up to some shit.

01:32.840 --> 01:33.840
Uh-huh.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.840
Yeah, he's really weak in the juice.

01:35.840 --> 01:39.840
He is a bad boy, that one.

01:39.840 --> 01:46.840
Yeah, but I feel like he's a lowercase b, lowercase b bad boy, as opposed to like capital b's all around, like I'm a bad boy.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.840
I'm a bad boy.

01:48.840 --> 01:54.840
I'm over here with fucking Nobzilla and the Wolfman, and I'm just a bad boy.

01:54.840 --> 02:01.840
You sound like you're like the third host, but also you live in the vents, and we can't get rid of you.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.840
Don't open that closet.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.840
Oh boy, that's the prize closet.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.840
If you want something out of there, it's your own risk.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.840
I have a confession to make.

02:12.840 --> 02:19.840
Almost every episode, I tend to start now by Googling Britney Spears just to see like how she's doing.

02:19.840 --> 02:28.840
Because I feel like she's on a sort of like power groove that no one is, like people aren't clocking it.

02:28.840 --> 02:33.840
It's a quest in the fantastical sense that like people rarely actually go on.

02:33.840 --> 02:39.840
She's like every, and this is not a mocking of Britney Spears, she's just on some like very next level shit,

02:39.840 --> 02:46.840
and is very much like having a personal journey that is completely about her own power and her own shit.

02:46.840 --> 02:52.840
So I just like to Google Britney Spears just to see like what is going on right now over there at that camp.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.840
Fucking first headline that pops up from one day ago,

02:56.840 --> 03:01.840
Britney Spears makes eye-opening discovery after watching Tim Burton's Big Eyes.

03:01.840 --> 03:09.840
How did that make the news?

03:09.840 --> 03:13.840
Okay, may I read the quote as to what the eye-opening discovery was?

03:13.840 --> 03:18.840
No, no, no, I've got the story here. I'm on this tit. Don't fucking Google Britney Spears after I already Googled her.

03:18.840 --> 03:21.840
If you wanted to make it a thing, you should have given it a segment name.

03:21.840 --> 03:30.840
The 38-year-old pop star took to Instagram on Saturday, August 8th, in the year of our Lord, 2020,

03:30.840 --> 03:37.840
to gush about Tim Burton, her favorite director in the whole world, and his 2014 drama about American painter Margaret Keane.

03:37.840 --> 03:46.840
She gives a short synopsis of the film, which starred Amy Adam and Christopher Waltz, a fucking, I mean, by any stretch of the imagination,

03:46.840 --> 03:50.840
a minor Tim Burton work that does, I'll admit, have its moments.

03:50.840 --> 03:52.840
And here's her quote.

03:52.840 --> 03:56.840
It was very weird the same day I watched this movie.

03:56.840 --> 04:03.840
I did a mini photo shoot and look how freaking big my eyes were, the singer wrote alongside the photo shoot pictures.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.840
I mean, my eyes have never been that big.

04:06.840 --> 04:12.840
It's actually kind of crazy and they aren't retouched at all. Coincidence, maybe?

04:12.840 --> 04:16.840
She said, and this is like, this is powerful, I think.

04:16.840 --> 04:22.840
If the power of what you see and hear can influence your life that much,

04:22.840 --> 04:29.840
I mean, literally stay away from bad people and raise your awareness with high-energy people.

04:29.840 --> 04:34.840
That's what I learned from this. And watch Big Eyes while you're at it. Thank you.

04:34.840 --> 04:38.840
And then it says hashtag ad, which is weird.

04:38.840 --> 04:45.840
Hashtag ad for the 2014 Sony Pictures film. No, for 2014's Big Eyes.

04:45.840 --> 04:53.840
I wish somebody would make a movie called Strong Muscles Big Wiener, because that would be sick to channel that.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.840
So that's Britney Spears just coming in.

04:56.840 --> 05:00.840
I would just hope I started recording. I jumped in on the boys.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.840
Normally we talk about what we're going to talk about at the beginning.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.840
I started the recording and just absolute called shot.

05:05.840 --> 05:09.840
Like, I hope Britney Spears is on some dope shit. And there she is.

05:09.840 --> 05:14.840
Just Britney talking about how good 2014's Big Eyes is. Did you see Big Eyes?

05:14.840 --> 05:16.840
No, I can't say I did.

05:16.840 --> 05:22.840
It's good. It's an okay little flick. That's what I'll say. It's okay.

05:22.840 --> 05:24.840
This has been Big Eyes Watch, I guess?

05:24.840 --> 05:27.840
More like Britney Watches Big Eyes Watch.

05:27.840 --> 05:34.840
Oh damn! Let's revisit. Let's do Britney Watch Scoob Watch. Get her take on Scoob.

05:34.840 --> 05:41.840
Hey, can we start doing the show? I feel like we got a lot of gas in the tank.

05:41.840 --> 05:46.840
If it's not Riddle Me Piss, then you can...

05:46.840 --> 05:49.840
It's not Riddle Me Piss. This is a different thing.

05:49.840 --> 05:56.840
I wanted to say thank you to everybody. We finished the Max Fun Drive. It was very surprisingly...

05:56.840 --> 06:02.840
A lot of people were giving and we weren't expecting all that support. It means the world.

06:02.840 --> 06:06.840
So we always talk about how people support. We like to put back into the show.

06:06.840 --> 06:08.840
Feels like play along at home.

06:08.840 --> 06:15.840
So I made a bit of an investment here and I wasn't sure how this was going to play out, but I have a special guest here.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.840
Hey everybody, it's me, Dave Matthews.

06:18.840 --> 06:28.840
My friend Travis reached out to me and asked permission to use some of my songs and he told me his idea.

06:28.840 --> 06:32.840
And I said, only if I can play to little baby.

06:32.840 --> 06:38.840
Dave, it's so cool to have you on the show. How have your sort of journeys been going, man?

06:38.840 --> 06:41.840
Tell me, any recent pilgrimages?

06:41.840 --> 06:43.840
Mostly into my own mind.

06:43.840 --> 06:56.840
That's probably for the best because of your sort of irresponsible sort of treatment of human waste while you are on.

06:56.840 --> 07:03.840
I've got a bad track record with my duty. I still feel bad about that.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.840
Say out loud what you did, like the court ordered you to do.

07:06.840 --> 07:11.840
Well, it wasn't me, but my tour bus was filled with Dave Matthews shit.

07:11.840 --> 07:15.840
Well, not just Dave Matthews, the shit of the band.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.840
If you think about how healthy that band eats, it's probably just cliff bars though, huh?

07:19.840 --> 07:21.840
Just a big table of cliff bars.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.840
We get a lot of roughage.

07:23.840 --> 07:31.840
And then my tour manager dumped it over the side of a bridge in Chicago, if I remember correctly, and it landed on a boat full of people.

07:31.840 --> 07:35.840
And I still feel real terrible about that.

07:35.840 --> 07:43.840
Yet, even if it hadn't landed on a boat full of people, Dave Matthews, you shouldn't make your boat shit over a bridge.

07:43.840 --> 07:50.840
Well, in recompense, I haven't pooped in over 20 years.

07:50.840 --> 07:51.840
Fantastic.

07:51.840 --> 07:57.840
I will say about Dave Matthews though, a lot of celebs have some black marks on their career.

07:57.840 --> 08:03.840
I do have to say in the grand skew of things, he made his bus take a shit on a boat. It's not the worst.

08:03.840 --> 08:11.840
So Travis and I have cooked up a little game for you all, and here's the theme song.

08:11.840 --> 08:18.840
We fish at each other, wondering what the other is fishing.

08:18.840 --> 08:25.840
We remember being fish, laying under the table and fishing.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.840
Thank you, Dave. I'll take it from here.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.840
So this game is called Laying Under the Table and Fishing.

08:30.840 --> 08:36.840
And what we've got here, I've got a collection of Dave Matthews lyrics and fish lyrics.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.840
Like the band Ph.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.840
The band Phish, and I'm going to read them.

08:40.840 --> 08:46.840
And these different rounds, they can be any combination of Dave Matthews band lyrics and fish lyrics.

08:46.840 --> 08:50.840
And Justin and Griffin, I want you to guess which is which.

08:50.840 --> 08:51.840
I think we understand.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.840
I unironically enjoy both of these bands.

08:53.840 --> 08:54.840
I do as well.

08:54.840 --> 08:55.840
Is that about to be a challenge?

08:55.840 --> 08:57.840
No, I do as well. I do as well.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.840
They just have a similar jam feeling.

09:00.840 --> 09:06.840
I mean, ants marching slaps ass, and I will cede a few more points to Mr. Matthews.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.840
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.840
I just wanted to jump back in here.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.840
A lot of my music slaps ass, Griffin.

09:12.840 --> 09:13.840
It's very good.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.840
I'm very proud of it.

09:15.840 --> 09:16.840
All right.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.840
I'm not proud of everything I've done in my life.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.840
Dave, can I talk to Travis?

09:20.840 --> 09:23.840
It may be like when you tell me you're busting your shit on a boat.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.840
Yes, I feel terrible about that.

09:25.840 --> 09:29.840
I've already said I've been blocked up for years because of the guilt.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.840
You're kind of turning into a southern grandpa, Dave Matthews band.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.840
When I go back, no one really knows where I'm from.

09:35.840 --> 09:36.840
South Africa.

09:36.840 --> 09:37.840
Maybe.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.840
I don't even know anymore.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.840
I've traveled so much.

09:42.840 --> 09:43.840
All right.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.840
Now, sorry, Dave.

09:44.840 --> 09:45.840
We're running out of time here, Dave.

09:45.840 --> 09:46.840
All right.

09:46.840 --> 09:47.840
Round one.

09:47.840 --> 09:48.840
Feels like it.

09:48.840 --> 09:49.840
Boy, it feels like it more and more every episode.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.840
Round one.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.840
Caught you just then.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.840
Hands were in the cookie jar.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.840
How can we share when you sneak up and go?

09:56.840 --> 09:59.840
I have no intention of losing my beard.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.840
How they design, and then we go again.

10:02.840 --> 10:03.840
Fish.

10:03.840 --> 10:07.840
I'm going to say fish just because Trey Anastasio oft has a beard,

10:07.840 --> 10:09.840
and I don't think I've ever seen Dave Matthews.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.840
And he loves cookies.

10:11.840 --> 10:12.840
Incorrect.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.840
That is Dave Matthews from Kit Kat Jam.

10:15.840 --> 10:16.840
Damn it.

10:16.840 --> 10:17.840
He did a song called Kit Kat Jam?

10:17.840 --> 10:19.840
Kit Kat Jam loves those.

10:19.840 --> 10:20.840
I love.

10:20.840 --> 10:21.840
Give me a break.

10:21.840 --> 10:22.840
Whoa, that was weird.

10:22.840 --> 10:26.840
You picked up the sentence right where Travis left off.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.840
Travis and I have been together so long now.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.840
We finish each other's sentences.

10:30.840 --> 10:31.840
All right.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.840
You've been there for all of Travis's major recent life events,

10:33.840 --> 10:37.840
like when he picked up a not great Dave Matthews impression.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.840
Well, I live inside Travis now.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.840
It's a being John Malkovich journey we're on.

10:42.840 --> 10:43.840
All right.

10:43.840 --> 10:44.840
Next lyric.

10:44.840 --> 10:45.840
I had to get away.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.840
I was losing my interest.

10:47.840 --> 10:51.840
Instead of expanding my world, I was just scanning Pinterest.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.840
Okay, wait.

10:53.840 --> 10:57.840
I want to say Dave Matthews.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.840
That feels too concrete for fish.

10:59.840 --> 11:06.840
I'm going to say fish every round and hope that I get some right.

11:06.840 --> 11:07.840
Griffin is correct.

11:07.840 --> 11:08.840
That is fish.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.840
Things people do.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.840
That's a great name for a song.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.840
Great name for a tune.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.840
Woman, please, I'm in your possession.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.840
You are my obsession.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.840
Let me go down, down, down, down, down.

11:20.840 --> 11:27.840
If I don't hop on that boat when Justin feels so certain about it

11:27.840 --> 11:29.840
and get dumped on that beautiful Vance bus.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.840
Hop on the boat, Griffin.

11:31.840 --> 11:32.840
Yes, that is correct.

11:32.840 --> 11:33.840
Because Dave Matthews Band 7 says,

11:33.840 --> 11:34.840
Justin 1, Griffin 2.

11:34.840 --> 11:35.840
Okay, you ready?

11:35.840 --> 11:36.840
Round 2.

11:36.840 --> 11:40.840
And then one day, you find it to your intense delight

11:40.840 --> 11:43.840
that three wrong turns can really make a right.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.840
So why not be like me?

11:45.840 --> 11:47.840
Be proud of all your crimes.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.840
Because when I screw up once, I do it two more times.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.840
That's fish.

11:52.840 --> 11:57.840
That is David Matthews Man.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.840
I'm the David Matthews Man.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.840
No, it is fish.

12:01.840 --> 12:02.840
Justin's correct.

12:02.840 --> 12:03.840
It's 2 and 2.

12:03.840 --> 12:04.840
That's from Fish's Blaze On.

12:04.840 --> 12:05.840
Next one.

12:05.840 --> 12:06.840
I can't stop thinking about you.

12:06.840 --> 12:07.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.840
Why would I want to?

12:09.840 --> 12:11.840
I like coffee with toast and jelly,

12:11.840 --> 12:14.840
but I'd rather be licking from your back to your belly.

12:14.840 --> 12:15.840
Fucking Dave Matthews.

12:15.840 --> 12:16.840
Are you kidding me?

12:16.840 --> 12:17.840
I think I'm going to.

12:17.840 --> 12:22.840
It's obvious it's Dave Matthews.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.840
Whoever it is, I'm wearing a wire,

12:24.840 --> 12:27.840
and I've been waiting for this moment to arrest David Matthews Man.

12:27.840 --> 12:32.840
It was me, David Matthews, from my song Shake Me Like a Monkey.

12:32.840 --> 12:33.840
Okay.

12:33.840 --> 12:34.840
Fucking Dave.

12:34.840 --> 12:35.840
That sucks, Dave.

12:35.840 --> 12:36.840
Here's a hint.

12:36.840 --> 12:37.840
There's my secret tip.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.840
If a lyric sends you looking for a hang-up button that does not exist,

12:41.840 --> 12:43.840
who is this?

12:43.840 --> 12:44.840
Hey, Dave.

12:44.840 --> 12:45.840
How did you get this number?

12:45.840 --> 12:47.840
David Matthews Man, can I ask you a question?

12:47.840 --> 12:48.840
Yes, please.

12:48.840 --> 12:52.840
Is it one uninterrupted lick?

12:52.840 --> 12:53.840
Yes.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.840
Okay.

12:54.840 --> 12:59.840
Which axis do you rotate the woman?

12:59.840 --> 13:01.840
I have a lathe.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.840
I'm glad you have a woman lathe, David Matthews Man.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.840
I only use it consensually.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.840
No, I know, but does it go sort of-

13:08.840 --> 13:09.840
And concentrically.

13:09.840 --> 13:10.840
Okay.

13:10.840 --> 13:11.840
Little baby.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.840
Fantastic.

13:13.840 --> 13:14.840
You're dodging the question.

13:14.840 --> 13:18.840
Do you go height-wise or-

13:18.840 --> 13:22.840
It depends on the day.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.840
That's a great deal of distance different.

13:25.840 --> 13:29.840
If you go from her back and then you go around her side of her tummy

13:29.840 --> 13:35.840
to her belly button, you're traveling half of the width circumference.

13:35.840 --> 13:40.840
But if you go from back and then over her head and down her face

13:40.840 --> 13:43.840
or down the butt is another option, Dave.

13:43.840 --> 13:47.840
And I feel like we're talking about a few different sort of tongue experiences.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.840
It all depends on how much time I have in my schedule.

13:50.840 --> 13:51.840
Are there more?

13:51.840 --> 13:52.840
There are more.

13:52.840 --> 13:53.840
Okay.

13:53.840 --> 13:54.840
Round three.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.840
Currently, I believe it's two and two.

13:56.840 --> 13:57.840
Okay.

13:57.840 --> 13:58.840
Oh no, three and three.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.840
How could it possibly be round three?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.840
If you give, you...

14:02.840 --> 14:03.840
Okay, sorry.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.840
If you give, you, you begin to live.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.840
If you give, you begin to live.

14:07.840 --> 14:08.840
You begin, you get the world.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.840
If you give, you begin to give.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.840
You get the world, you get the world.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.840
If you give, you begin to live.

14:14.840 --> 14:16.840
Dave.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.840
That was you, Dave, wasn't it?

14:18.840 --> 14:22.840
I'm going to say fish because that feels like a jam sort of.

14:22.840 --> 14:23.840
It was me, Dave Matthew.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.840
I can't, I don't know what that means.

14:25.840 --> 14:28.840
Dave Matthew's man kind of breaks sometimes.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.840
And you've got to, you've got to get a little needle

14:30.840 --> 14:33.840
and you've got to push it in his little reset indentation.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.840
And it's either on his back or his belly.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.840
In his dimple.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.840
Okay, so that was Dave.

14:39.840 --> 14:40.840
That's Dave.

14:40.840 --> 14:41.840
Wow, congratulations.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.840
So it's four to three.

14:42.840 --> 14:43.840
Griffin is winning.

14:43.840 --> 14:44.840
And that's from the song, You Might Die Trying.

14:44.840 --> 14:45.840
Okay, next one.

14:45.840 --> 14:49.840
Legally, you have to tell me how many more fucking questions there are left.

14:49.840 --> 14:50.840
One last one.

14:50.840 --> 14:53.840
I'm not all bad, but I'm a faithful sinner.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.840
I might get lost, but I'll be home for dinner.

14:56.840 --> 14:57.840
Fish.

14:57.840 --> 15:00.840
If God don't like me, he can send me to hell.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.840
But I love the way you love me, girl.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.840
I love the way you move.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.840
Now see, it's Dave Matthew.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.840
If he says that, if he mentions girl,

15:09.840 --> 15:10.840
I feel like fish doesn't fuck like that.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.840
Dave Matthew's band is like, get on my lathe, girl.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.840
I'm going to say Dave Matthew's man.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.840
It was the Dave Matthew's man.

15:17.840 --> 15:22.840
Griffin wins five to four, but it was a good, good battle.

15:22.840 --> 15:29.840
Dave Matthews, every lyric Dave Matthews writes is like a very creative pervert.

15:29.840 --> 15:35.840
And every song that Fish writes is like a harlequin with gout.

15:35.840 --> 15:44.840
If it's a medieval harlequin or some sort of like jester in a dark carnival, that feels more like Fish.

15:44.840 --> 15:51.840
I just want to remind everyone that my song, Crash, is about a man spying on a woman through a window.

15:51.840 --> 15:54.840
I love songs about perverts.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.840
Stop getting married to it.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.840
I love perverts.

15:58.840 --> 16:03.840
I might not be one myself, but I celebrate their whole deal.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.840
Thank you so much for having me.

16:05.840 --> 16:10.840
Do you guys have any snacks or a bathroom I could use?

16:10.840 --> 16:11.840
Okay, goodbye. Thank you, Dave.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.840
This is our advice show, obviously.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.840
Oh, you're kidding me.

16:15.840 --> 16:16.840
We're 16 minutes in.

16:16.840 --> 16:17.840
We're just now laying out.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.840
I don't think we can say that fucking anymore.

16:19.840 --> 16:20.840
It is.

16:20.840 --> 16:23.840
This is a Dave Matthews show where we sometimes tell people what to do.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.840
I'm in an air travel related pickle.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.840
Next month, I'm moving from Japan to the Czech Republic.

16:28.840 --> 16:31.840
I'm in the midst of packing things to ship over, which is expensive as shit.

16:31.840 --> 16:35.840
I got three hats I refuse to part with, a couple of bowlers, and a wide brim hat.

16:35.840 --> 16:38.840
The problem is they don't fit the last box in my suitcase.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.840
I can already see what you're about to ask.

16:40.840 --> 16:46.840
So how many hats is too many hats to wear on an airplane without getting caught, stopped?

16:46.840 --> 16:50.840
How many hats can I wear before I'm too suspicious?

16:50.840 --> 16:52.840
And that's from Mariah.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.840
Okay, I can say from experience.

16:54.840 --> 17:00.840
I have worn one hat, and I've had to remove it so they could pat my hair.

17:00.840 --> 17:03.840
And tell me I'm a good boy.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.840
Yeah, and then they smelled their hand for a long time.

17:06.840 --> 17:09.840
Yeah, so I will just say one hat.

17:09.840 --> 17:13.840
And now I think you're asking several questions here, Mariah, right?

17:13.840 --> 17:18.840
Because I don't think, I don't know about the travel laws of either Japan or Czech Republic,

17:18.840 --> 17:24.840
but I don't think there's anything illegal about wearing more than one hat onto an airplane.

17:24.840 --> 17:34.840
No, I mean, we can't wager a guess at the sort of cultural differences that would sort of aid us in answering this question.

17:34.840 --> 17:40.840
I do think we can say that I can't imagine a society where three hats is great.

17:40.840 --> 17:44.840
I want to hit you guys with a question, a theoretical question.

17:44.840 --> 17:56.840
Okay, is there a place that is less suspicious to put a second hat than on top of the first hat?

17:56.840 --> 18:00.840
Because I'm sitting here thinking about it, like what if you put it here or here or here?

18:00.840 --> 18:06.840
I feel like any place you put the second hat is going to be more weird than on top of the first hat.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.840
Yeah.

18:08.840 --> 18:18.840
Is that fair? Could you safety pin the hats together so that one hat goes on top of your head and the other two hang down on either side of your head?

18:18.840 --> 18:20.840
Okay.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.840
And just call it fashion.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.840
Oh, this is fashion.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.840
It's fashion.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.840
I feel like you could have one on a carabiner on your waist.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.840
That's fucking great, Juice.

18:30.840 --> 18:38.840
That's like, listen, I don't know what this day is going to hold. This hat could get, I don't know, ruined.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.840
Blown away by a jet engine.

18:40.840 --> 18:46.840
Could get blown away by a jet engine, confiscated by a handsy TSA agent. No one knows.

18:46.840 --> 18:54.840
But I think you could do one on your waist, on your belt hook.

18:54.840 --> 19:00.840
And for the third, let me suggest, big teddy bear. You put that hat on the teddy bear.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.840
That's actually not bad, Travis. God damn it.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.840
Well, I mean, it is. All you've done there is added a tremendous amount of bulk to your hat.

19:08.840 --> 19:13.840
It is when I get carry-ons. Yeah, it now becomes a carry-on. But you can't carry on a hat.

19:13.840 --> 19:17.840
You can't be like, I have two carry-ons, my backpack and this hat.

19:17.840 --> 19:24.840
And that's good for going through security, too, because you're carrying a giant bear wearing a hat. And they'll say, that's adorable.

19:24.840 --> 19:28.840
You're like, yeah, his name is Mr. Not-Filled-With-Drugs.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.840
Okay, we don't test him.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.840
Let me ask you guys something.

19:32.840 --> 19:36.840
Come here, Doctor. Come here, Doctor Oozy Belly.

19:36.840 --> 19:41.840
What is more suspish? Two hats or three hats?

19:41.840 --> 19:43.840
Two hats is way more suspish than three hats.

19:43.840 --> 19:44.840
Agreed.

19:44.840 --> 19:49.840
Here's the thing that's fucked up about what Travis said about it being fashion.

19:49.840 --> 19:57.840
If I saw somebody with two hats, I would think it was some sort of shell game or something terrible is underneath one of the hats.

19:57.840 --> 20:01.840
If I see three hats on the person, I'll be like, that must be the style.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.840
Three hats, you're doing a thing.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.840
You're doing a thing, yeah.

20:05.840 --> 20:06.840
Now it's an affectation.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.840
Two hats, you're being an asshole.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.840
Two hats, you might have put on a hat forgetting you already had a hat on.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.840
That's what I'm saying. Two hats, this is my argument.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.840
Two hats raises the, and I think this is what we're finally getting the meat of here.

20:19.840 --> 20:23.840
Two hats raises the question of did they not remember that they had already placed a hat on their head.

20:23.840 --> 20:24.840
Correct.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.840
Three, there's just no way.

20:26.840 --> 20:29.840
We've kissed plausibility goodbye, it's a choice you're making.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.840
And I can get on board with that if it's a choice.

20:31.840 --> 20:35.840
You've chosen.

20:35.840 --> 20:41.840
I just remembered the types of hats we are talking about here, and it is two bowlers and a wide brimmed hat.

20:41.840 --> 20:42.840
Oh, easy.

20:42.840 --> 20:47.840
So you go bowler, wide brimmed hat bowler, wide brimmed hat sandwich, bada bing, bada boom, fashion.

20:47.840 --> 20:50.840
That is the way to do it, yeah.

20:50.840 --> 20:55.840
I guess my question is, and please Mara, I do not take this as a personal judgment on you,

20:55.840 --> 20:59.840
but there is no way to get through this sentence without it being explicitly that.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.840
Why do you need these hats?

21:02.840 --> 21:04.840
Because they're cool hats, Griffin.

21:04.840 --> 21:15.840
Two bowlers and a wide brimmed hat feels like, especially when you're doing an uprooting of your life from one sort of region to another.

21:15.840 --> 21:16.840
Yeah, clean slate.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.840
I think you should clean slate it.

21:18.840 --> 21:28.840
When I moved from Cincinnati to Chicago, I threw so much stuff in the dumpsters right behind the shitty apartment that Travis and I lived in.

21:28.840 --> 21:30.840
I threw several swords away.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.840
You think I wanted to keep those swords?

21:32.840 --> 21:33.840
Yeah.

21:33.840 --> 21:34.840
Absolutely I did.

21:34.840 --> 21:36.840
But I'm starting over.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.840
I'm rebooting my life.

21:38.840 --> 21:46.840
Maybe now in your new life, your Czech Republic life, you just have one hat that you're very proud of.

21:46.840 --> 21:53.840
What if you wore all three hats and as you walked into the terminal, you just kept shouting, hats for sale.

21:53.840 --> 21:54.840
50 cents a cap.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.840
I've got hats for sale.

21:56.840 --> 22:01.840
And then you go through security and then you continue yelling, hats for sale.

22:01.840 --> 22:04.840
Hats! And then everyone's like, why is that person wearing so many hats?

22:04.840 --> 22:07.840
Oh, obviously, it's because they're for sale.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.840
Now, obviously, there's a downside here.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.840
There is a risk where someone buys your hat.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.840
Someone's gonna buy your hat and then you don't have any more.

22:13.840 --> 22:14.840
Yeah.

22:14.840 --> 22:15.840
But that's a choice.

22:15.840 --> 22:16.840
I mean, at least you got that going for you now.

22:16.840 --> 22:17.840
You can buy another hat when you get there.

22:17.840 --> 22:18.840
Yes.

22:18.840 --> 22:20.840
I would make the argument it's a risk of being too pragmatic about it.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.840
If you can't wear all three of these hats at the same time, you probably don't need three hats.

22:24.840 --> 22:25.840
Thank you.

22:25.840 --> 22:26.840
Huh.

22:26.840 --> 22:27.840
Well, yeah.

22:27.840 --> 22:28.840
Huh.

22:28.840 --> 22:32.840
But what about coordinating with different outfits?

22:32.840 --> 22:36.840
Just get rid of the outfits that match the other two hats.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.840
Ah, but they only have three outfits.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.840
It's like, have you never seen, it's like, have you never seen Doug?

22:41.840 --> 22:44.840
Like, just wear the same outfit and the same hat.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.840
How come Doug never wore a bowler?

22:46.840 --> 22:50.840
Can we, he would have been chomping fucking BB's style if he did that.

22:50.840 --> 22:51.840
That's true.

22:51.840 --> 22:56.840
Can we taskmaster this a little bit and like, try and, why,

22:56.840 --> 22:59.840
I think there's a way to do this without it being weird at all.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.840
Wide brim hat goes on the head.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.840
There is nowhere else that that is going to go.

23:03.840 --> 23:04.840
Yes.

23:04.840 --> 23:05.840
The brim is far too wide.

23:05.840 --> 23:11.840
One bowler, you put some elastic on it and put that around your face.

23:11.840 --> 23:12.840
That's your mask.

23:12.840 --> 23:13.840
Okay.

23:13.840 --> 23:14.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:14.840 --> 23:15.840
Yes.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.840
Now we just have one more hat to conceal.

23:17.840 --> 23:21.840
And I feel like so far, boys, I've done the lion's share of the work on this.

23:21.840 --> 23:22.840
Okay.

23:22.840 --> 23:23.840
I have it.

23:23.840 --> 23:25.840
So if you can tell me where the other hat goes, where it's not going to be weird.

23:25.840 --> 23:26.840
You're going to-

23:26.840 --> 23:28.840
Don't say under the shirt and say it's like a tummy.

23:28.840 --> 23:29.840
No.

23:29.840 --> 23:30.840
Okay.

23:30.840 --> 23:31.840
No.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.840
You're going to clip two straps onto it, sling it over your shoulders.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.840
Now it's like a hat pack, you know?

23:36.840 --> 23:39.840
It's kind of like, oh, that's like a cool looking backpack.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.840
It looks like just like a bowler.

23:41.840 --> 23:42.840
Thanks.

23:42.840 --> 23:43.840
It's a hat.

23:43.840 --> 23:44.840
Thanks.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.840
It's just a regular hat.

23:46.840 --> 23:47.840
What do you keep-

23:47.840 --> 23:51.840
You like take off to show them and just like packs of loose gum fall out of it.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.840
It's very bad and ineffective.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.840
It's a hat pack.

23:56.840 --> 23:57.840
It's a hat pack.

23:57.840 --> 23:58.840
What do you keep in it?

23:58.840 --> 23:59.840
What do you keep in it?

23:59.840 --> 24:01.840
The hat.

24:01.840 --> 24:05.840
It takes my hat from one to another.

24:05.840 --> 24:11.840
I do think though you could do the like neck thing, like hang it like a safari guy from

24:11.840 --> 24:13.840
your neck hanging to your back.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.840
And maybe no one would question it.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.840
I think you might be able to get away with that actually.

24:17.840 --> 24:21.840
I actually think now that I'm thinking about it with all the TSA agents here in the United

24:21.840 --> 24:25.840
States that I've encountered, they would be like, are there drugs or a bomb or whatever

24:25.840 --> 24:26.840
in that?

24:26.840 --> 24:27.840
And I'd be like, no.

24:27.840 --> 24:28.840
And they'd be like, then just keep, please keep moving.

24:28.840 --> 24:29.840
Please keep moving.

24:29.840 --> 24:33.840
We have a lot of people to get through and I don't care about your dumb ass hats.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.840
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

24:35.840 --> 24:36.840
Please.

24:36.840 --> 24:37.840
I'm so excited for this one.

24:37.840 --> 24:38.840
It's sent by the prospector Merritt Palmer.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.840
Mariah, I'm not saying your hats are dumb.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.840
I'm saying all my hats are dumb.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.840
No, I'm not saying Mariah's hats are dumb.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.840
I'm saying two of them are.

24:46.840 --> 24:47.840
Okay.

24:47.840 --> 24:48.840
And one of them is good.

24:48.840 --> 24:51.840
And that's the one to really invest in.

24:51.840 --> 24:52.840
Okay.

24:52.840 --> 24:56.840
This Yahoo is asked by Yahoo Answers user HangingBat.

24:56.840 --> 24:57.840
And I'll be honest with you, boys.

24:57.840 --> 25:00.840
I mostly want to talk about this one for the responses.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.840
HangingBat asks, poll.

25:03.840 --> 25:08.840
If you were a recipe, what ingredients would I need?

25:08.840 --> 25:12.840
Big open mouth smiley face emoticon.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.840
Is this a sexy thing?

25:15.840 --> 25:17.840
You read it like that.

25:17.840 --> 25:21.840
It's on Yahoo Answers, so it's gonna be for some people.

25:21.840 --> 25:22.840
Okay.

25:22.840 --> 25:25.840
If I was a recipe, not what food would I be,

25:25.840 --> 25:27.840
but what ingredients?

25:27.840 --> 25:28.840
Yeah.

25:28.840 --> 25:31.840
So we have 10 responses to this.

25:31.840 --> 25:32.840
Okay, okay.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.840
10 Yahoo Answers users have weighed in.

25:34.840 --> 25:38.840
And given their, I'm on allrecipes.com

25:38.840 --> 25:43.840
looking at these users' recipes to make them as human beings

25:43.840 --> 25:46.840
as they are known on the Earth today.

25:46.840 --> 25:50.840
And each one is a slam dunk in a different way,

25:50.840 --> 25:52.840
which I've never really seen before.

25:52.840 --> 25:53.840
And I would like to just sort of do them.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.840
These are from two days ago, by the way.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.840
Merrick got this one hot and fresh out the kitchen.

25:57.840 --> 26:02.840
P says, everything's sweet and a large oven.

26:02.840 --> 26:04.840
Tongue sticking out emoticon.

26:04.840 --> 26:08.840
Weasel McWeasel says, a healthy dose of no quit

26:08.840 --> 26:11.840
with a liberal splash of charm and wit.

26:11.840 --> 26:12.840
That's good.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.840
But those aren't ingredients that you can buy.

26:14.840 --> 26:18.840
I can't go to the store and be like, where is your don't quit?

26:18.840 --> 26:21.840
Travis, you can't approach this.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.840
I need you to come at this with the open

26:23.840 --> 26:25.840
and honest heart of a child's eyes.

26:25.840 --> 26:28.840
I mean, I understand that, but I was sitting here

26:28.840 --> 26:30.840
thinking about, I don't know, some salt.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.840
Like I was like trying to do it.

26:32.840 --> 26:35.840
Travis's recipe is a fucking little pair of glasses

26:35.840 --> 26:37.840
he can push up his nose when he's being an asshole.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.840
Hence nay, please.

26:39.840 --> 26:40.840
Exactly, thank you.

26:40.840 --> 26:41.840
Thank you.

26:41.840 --> 26:44.840
This one's, yeah, Little Big Man says, a heart.

26:44.840 --> 26:48.840
And as the song goes, handel me with care.

26:48.840 --> 26:52.840
You know the song from, I guess the composer,

26:52.840 --> 26:55.840
Handel me with care.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.840
Cheese brain does say tequila, mix orange juice

26:57.840 --> 27:01.840
or some Sprite will be fine, add loads of ice.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.840
That's a screwdriver, I think.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.840
But those are ingredients.

27:05.840 --> 27:06.840
It's not a screwdriver.

27:06.840 --> 27:08.840
If you want to make Travis, you need blood

27:08.840 --> 27:13.840
and bones and skin and some goo for the eyeballs.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.840
But what of the soul?

27:15.840 --> 27:18.840
I don't, call God, don't put a soul in there.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.840
All right, Elliot, that's rough.

27:20.840 --> 27:24.840
Elliot the corgi says lots of fur, vanilla ice cream

27:24.840 --> 27:26.840
and a cozy hoodie, hun.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.840
Wait, lots of fur?

27:28.840 --> 27:30.840
Lots of fur, please let me finish.

27:30.840 --> 27:33.840
This one got, this is the only one of these 10 answers.

27:33.840 --> 27:36.840
You can give the answers a thumbs up or a thumbs down.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.840
This one has two thumbs up and one thumbs down.

27:38.840 --> 27:42.840
It's the only one that somebody said no.

27:42.840 --> 27:46.840
Lots of fur, vanilla ice cream and a cozy hoodie, hun

27:46.840 --> 27:48.840
and then a dog emoji.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.840
And I don't know if the dog is part of it.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.840
Okay, read the username.

27:53.840 --> 27:54.840
Elliot the corgi.

27:54.840 --> 27:55.840
Thank you.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.840
It's a corgi.

27:56.840 --> 27:57.840
Yeah.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.840
Got the ability to use a computer.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.840
Then why the hoodie?

28:01.840 --> 28:03.840
Now the hoodie is a good question

28:03.840 --> 28:05.840
because it's weird enough you're on the internet.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.840
You don't need to draw more attention to yourself

28:07.840 --> 28:08.840
by wearing a hoodie.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.840
Dogs have nature's hoodie.

28:10.840 --> 28:12.840
And I love a corgi too.

28:12.840 --> 28:14.840
But that is, and please corgi users,

28:14.840 --> 28:16.840
actually go ahead and tweet at me corgi lovers.

28:16.840 --> 28:18.840
They're not the best smelling breed of dog.

28:18.840 --> 28:19.840
They got that coarse hair.

28:19.840 --> 28:20.840
They sweat a lot.

28:20.840 --> 28:21.840
They're low to the ground.

28:21.840 --> 28:22.840
They pick up a lot of detritus.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.840
I don't want to continue.

28:24.840 --> 28:25.840
What is the best smelling dog?

28:25.840 --> 28:26.840
Recycling that.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.840
What's the best smelling dog?

28:28.840 --> 28:29.840
Uh-huh.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.840
Hmm.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.840
Chocolate lab.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.840
Does it smell like chocolate?

28:35.840 --> 28:37.840
Is that what you mean?

28:37.840 --> 28:39.840
ABCA Me.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.840
Griffin, I'm sorry.

28:40.840 --> 28:42.840
Does it smell like chocolate?

28:42.840 --> 28:43.840
Yeah.

28:43.840 --> 28:44.840
ABCA Me says,

28:44.840 --> 28:46.840
egg whites, granulated sugar, cream of tartar,

28:46.840 --> 28:48.840
tartar or tartar?

28:48.840 --> 28:49.840
Nobody's quite sure.

28:49.840 --> 28:50.840
Vanilla extract.

28:50.840 --> 28:51.840
So that's Travis, actually.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.840
Yes, thank you.

28:53.840 --> 28:56.840
My friend fucking Hal A. Pino says,

28:56.840 --> 28:59.840
high octane, grain alcohol matches,

28:59.840 --> 29:03.840
and the ability to run really, really, really fast.

29:03.840 --> 29:14.840
Can you handle it?

29:14.840 --> 29:15.840
Nice.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.840
Just the idea.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.840
If someone's like, how fast do you run?

29:19.840 --> 29:23.840
You're like, really, really, really fast.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.840
We're going to burn some shit down.

29:25.840 --> 29:26.840
Why?

29:26.840 --> 29:31.840
Because we're making this Yahoo Answers user in the lab.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.840
I'm going to read the ingredients to this one first,

29:33.840 --> 29:34.840
and then I'll read the username.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.840
Just a vat of high fructose corn syrup

29:37.840 --> 29:40.840
and a mold that looks like a roach.

29:40.840 --> 29:43.840
And that's from Yahoo Answers user, Gummy Roach.

29:43.840 --> 29:46.840
Oh.

29:46.840 --> 29:49.840
They didn't make this account to answer this question.

29:49.840 --> 29:53.840
They have answered 8,634 questions.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.840
They have 314,000 points.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.840
This is a power user.

29:57.840 --> 29:58.840
This person's name I can't read

29:58.840 --> 30:00.840
because it's made out of weird characters,

30:00.840 --> 30:01.840
but I think it might say Shadow.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.840
Shadow says spice, spice, and more spice.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.840
No, why don't you?

30:05.840 --> 30:07.840
Spice as hot as pepper spice.

30:07.840 --> 30:08.840
So hot you can't handle it.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.840
I'm talking about Carolina Reaper hot,

30:10.840 --> 30:12.840
the world's hottest pepper.

30:12.840 --> 30:19.840
I guess Shadow is just a big pepper?

30:19.840 --> 30:21.840
Also, Shadow, I don't know how to tell you this,

30:21.840 --> 30:24.840
but spice is like a category of food.

30:24.840 --> 30:26.840
You wouldn't, in a recipe book,

30:26.840 --> 30:29.840
add eggs and butter and some spice.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.840
This username is corrupted in some way.

30:31.840 --> 30:32.840
I can't read it.

30:32.840 --> 30:33.840
It's just two blank boxes.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.840
It says passion fruit and Turkish delight.

30:35.840 --> 30:39.840
So they're bringing up the weakest result there.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.840
But I like any of these that I could go,

30:42.840 --> 30:43.840
okay, I'm going to make this person.

30:43.840 --> 30:45.840
The Gummy Roach, I could make that.

30:45.840 --> 30:46.840
You could make that person.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.840
That one wins Travis's prize.

30:48.840 --> 30:51.840
Right, but if it's like, can't do attitude

30:51.840 --> 30:53.840
and a whole bunch, don't quit,

30:53.840 --> 30:54.840
can you handle that?

30:54.840 --> 30:56.840
I'm like, that's not helpful.

30:56.840 --> 30:57.840
That's like if I said how to make a cake

30:57.840 --> 31:00.840
and you said lots of sweet and delicious.

31:00.840 --> 31:01.840
Fuck you.

31:01.840 --> 31:02.840
That's nothing.

31:02.840 --> 31:05.840
I feel like that could get most people there though.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.840
Yeah, if I said make a cake

31:07.840 --> 31:09.840
and they said, what do I need to make it?

31:09.840 --> 31:11.840
I say, you just need some delicious in there.

31:11.840 --> 31:13.840
They'd be like, I'm on it.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.840
Now, Yahoo Answers user Hangingbat responded,

31:15.840 --> 31:17.840
updated the question three days ago

31:17.840 --> 31:19.840
that said too hot to handle, lol.

31:19.840 --> 31:20.840
And I don't know what that's-

31:20.840 --> 31:21.840
Lol.

31:21.840 --> 31:24.840
No fucking idea what that's responding to.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.840
I'm guessing the Carolina Reaper won.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.840
Did they win?

31:29.840 --> 31:32.840
Anyway, what was the recipe for you two boys?

31:34.840 --> 31:36.840
For mine would be can't do attitude

31:36.840 --> 31:38.840
and don't quit

31:38.840 --> 31:40.840
and three eggs

31:40.840 --> 31:42.840
and some blood.

31:42.840 --> 31:47.840
Mine would be probably neutral colored shorts.

31:47.840 --> 31:52.840
Uh-huh.

31:52.840 --> 31:55.840
And then I think you could just improvise the rest of it.

31:55.840 --> 31:56.840
Yeah.

31:56.840 --> 32:01.840
The neutral colored shorts are so essential to my recipe.

32:01.840 --> 32:02.840
Yeah.

32:02.840 --> 32:07.840
My recipe on all recipes would be neutral shorts soup

32:07.840 --> 32:09.840
and then in parentheses, Griffin McElroy soup.

32:09.840 --> 32:10.840
Yeah, uh-huh.

32:10.840 --> 32:12.840
Because that's what they call it in some regions.

32:12.840 --> 32:17.840
Mine would be a mustard seed faith and a world-class hog.

32:17.840 --> 32:18.840
Huh.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.840
Now, huh.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.840
Okay.

32:23.840 --> 32:24.840
With mountains.

32:24.840 --> 32:25.840
I was just-

32:25.840 --> 32:26.840
With which?

32:26.840 --> 32:27.840
With which?

32:27.840 --> 32:29.840
Exactly.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.840
I have faith in my hog.

32:31.840 --> 32:35.840
And Travis' was eggs and blood and can't do attitude

32:35.840 --> 32:36.840
because he didn't want to play.

32:36.840 --> 32:38.840
Okay, do you want to hear mine?

32:38.840 --> 32:39.840
No, no, you did yours.

32:39.840 --> 32:40.840
You decided you didn't want to play.

32:40.840 --> 32:43.840
I said mine before that it was blood and bones.

32:43.840 --> 32:47.840
You stay in the dugout because you didn't want to play.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.840
And the coach put me and Justin,

32:48.840 --> 32:50.840
and we're out here fucking swinging, smashing homers.

32:50.840 --> 32:52.840
Well, if you want to make a Travis,

32:52.840 --> 32:54.840
then you need some T for tasty

32:54.840 --> 32:57.840
and you need some R for ravishing.

32:57.840 --> 32:58.840
The game's already over.

32:58.840 --> 32:59.840
He's still running around the bases.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.840
And you need some A for ass.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.840
He's still running around the bases.

33:03.840 --> 33:06.840
And you need some V for virginity now.

33:06.840 --> 33:11.840
And you need some I for indecent.

33:11.840 --> 33:13.840
Long ago, somebody left with the cup.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.840
And you need some S for sexy.

33:15.840 --> 33:17.840
And he's still going around.

33:17.840 --> 33:26.840
And then you need some M for marscapone.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.840
Okay, so we're going to take a quick break.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.840
And when we return to you here just after the music,

33:31.840 --> 33:33.840
we'll be talking about some beloved sponsors.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.840
So get there for that.

33:35.840 --> 33:46.840
Squarespace.

33:46.840 --> 33:49.840
It's time, my friends, time for the uprising.

33:49.840 --> 33:52.840
You've been doing too much in the meat space.

33:52.840 --> 33:55.840
And it's time to do it in the Squarespace.

33:55.840 --> 33:58.840
You're going to build a website, not just any website,

33:58.840 --> 34:01.840
a beautiful website that stands out and changes the world.

34:01.840 --> 34:02.840
It's time to disrupt.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.840
It's time to showcase your work.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.840
Sell products and services of all kinds.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.840
Promote your physical or online business and more.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.840
And what's that and more?

34:11.840 --> 34:13.840
Whatever you can dream.

34:13.840 --> 34:14.840
You can dream it.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.840
You can do it with beautiful customizable templates

34:16.840 --> 34:18.840
created by world-class designers.

34:18.840 --> 34:21.840

34:46.840 --> 34:51.840
You got me ready to like overthrow the fucking economy

34:51.840 --> 34:52.840
and government.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.840
Yeah dude, let's disrupt.

34:54.840 --> 34:57.840
Nothing, all the other stuff that has happened until now

34:57.840 --> 34:58.840
that has been so bad.

34:58.840 --> 34:59.840
Yeah.

34:59.840 --> 35:00.840
That wasn't, this was the domino.

35:00.840 --> 35:02.840
This was the V for Vendetta.

35:02.840 --> 35:03.840
You knocked that shit right over.

35:03.840 --> 35:04.840
That's right.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.840
Can you imagine a V in V for Vendetta?

35:06.840 --> 35:08.840
I was like, yes, we have to stop all of this,

35:08.840 --> 35:10.840
all of this horrible stuff.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.840
And also look at the website I created.

35:12.840 --> 35:16.840
It's got photos of all my travels and some of the pages

35:16.840 --> 35:18.840
are password protected.

35:18.840 --> 35:20.840
And now Natalie Portman, check this out.

35:20.840 --> 35:21.840
Click.

35:24.840 --> 35:25.840
Hey Stitch Fix also.

35:25.840 --> 35:28.840
The government tried to shut down my hamster dance.

35:28.840 --> 35:31.840
But they can't stop the signal.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.840
Wait, isn't that Serenity?

35:33.840 --> 35:35.840
I love that movie.

35:35.840 --> 35:36.840
Great flick.

35:36.840 --> 35:40.840
Stitch Fix is here to give us boxes of clothes.

35:40.840 --> 35:42.840
So we don't go to clothes store

35:42.840 --> 35:44.840
and we bring the clothes store to us,

35:44.840 --> 35:46.840
except it's not even like that

35:46.840 --> 35:48.840
because you have a personal stylist

35:48.840 --> 35:50.840
who you give a little profile for

35:50.840 --> 35:52.840
and they will figure out what clothes

35:52.840 --> 35:53.840
are gonna look really good.

35:53.840 --> 35:56.840
All these boxes are personalized just for you

35:56.840 --> 35:58.840
and your color styles and budget

35:58.840 --> 36:00.840
and you get nice looking clothes

36:00.840 --> 36:02.840
and you pay a $20 styling fee

36:02.840 --> 36:04.840
for each fix that is sent your way

36:04.840 --> 36:06.840
which is credited towards anything you keep

36:06.840 --> 36:09.840
and you can schedule it for any time.

36:09.840 --> 36:12.840
You can change your schedule whenever you want.

36:12.840 --> 36:14.840
I have been getting them every month

36:14.840 --> 36:16.840
but I don't leave the house anymore

36:16.840 --> 36:18.840
so I've bumped it back to once every two months

36:18.840 --> 36:20.840
and it's no big deal.

36:20.840 --> 36:21.840
It's real fucking easy.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.840
There's no subscription required.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.840
Shipping, returns and exchanges are always easy and free.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.840
You only pay for what you keep

36:28.840 --> 36:30.840
and you can get started today

36:30.840 --> 36:31.840
at stitchfix.com slash my brother

36:31.840 --> 36:34.840
and you'll get 25% off when you keep everything in your fix.

36:34.840 --> 36:36.840
That's stitchfix.com slash my brother

36:36.840 --> 36:39.840

36:39.840 --> 36:43.840
one last time, stitchfix.com slash my brother.

36:43.840 --> 36:44.840
Hi, I'm Allie Gertz.

36:44.840 --> 36:45.840
And I'm Julia Prescott

36:45.840 --> 36:47.840
and we host Round Springfield.

36:47.840 --> 36:51.840
Round Springfield is a new Simpsons podcast

36:51.840 --> 36:54.840
that is Simpsons adjacent in its topic.

36:54.840 --> 36:58.840
We talk to Simpsons writers, directors, voiceover actors,

36:58.840 --> 37:01.840
you name it, about non-Simpsons things that they've done

37:01.840 --> 37:05.840
because surprise, they're all extremely talented.

37:05.840 --> 37:06.840
Absolutely.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.840
For example, David X. Cohen worked on The Simpsons

37:08.840 --> 37:11.840
but then created a little show called Futurama.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.840
That's our very first episode.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.840
So tune in for stuff like that with Yardley Smith,

37:15.840 --> 37:17.840
with Sim Long, with different writers and voice actors.

37:17.840 --> 37:18.840
It's going to be so much fun

37:18.840 --> 37:21.840
and we are every other week on MaximumFun.org

37:21.840 --> 37:24.840
or wherever you get your podcasts.

37:26.840 --> 37:27.840
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

37:27.840 --> 37:28.840
Oh?

37:28.840 --> 37:29.840
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

37:29.840 --> 37:30.840
Yeah.

37:30.840 --> 37:34.840
Bum, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num.

37:34.840 --> 37:35.840
I want a munch.

37:35.840 --> 37:36.840
Squad.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.840
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.840
I want too much.

37:40.840 --> 37:41.840
Squad.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.840
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

37:43.840 --> 37:44.840
Welcome to Munch Squad,

37:44.840 --> 37:46.840
it's a podcast within a podcast,

37:46.840 --> 37:49.840
we're following the latest and greatest in brand eating.

37:49.840 --> 37:53.840
I am so excited because America has decided to pretend

37:53.840 --> 37:55.840
that coronavirus does not exist.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.840
And as a result, our fast food chains

37:57.840 --> 38:01.840
are beginning to awaken from their great slumber

38:02.840 --> 38:06.840
for new creations, new ideas, fresh thinking.

38:06.840 --> 38:09.840
And who does fresh better than Chipotle?

38:11.840 --> 38:13.840
Oh, is that rhetorical or is that a real question?

38:13.840 --> 38:18.840
No, I mean, if you would have said like a Hardee's,

38:18.840 --> 38:20.840
I would have given you some shit,

38:20.840 --> 38:23.840
but I feel like Chipotle is middle of the pack.

38:23.840 --> 38:25.840
You're thinking fresh, you're thinking Chipotle.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.840
They did the fucking Fiona Apple commercial.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.840
Yeah, well, this one is new

38:30.840 --> 38:33.840
and Chipotle is launching the Tony Hawk burrito.

38:33.840 --> 38:34.840
Huh?

38:34.840 --> 38:37.840
Fresh as hell.

38:37.840 --> 38:41.840
Chipotle Mexican Grill on Monday, this one's fucking fresh.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.840
The box came out today.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.840
The Chipotle Mexican Grill on Monday

38:46.840 --> 38:49.840
announces teaming up with skating legend

38:49.840 --> 38:51.840
and brand super fan, Tony Hawk,

38:51.840 --> 38:55.840
to offer his go-to Chipotle order exclusively

38:55.840 --> 38:57.840
on the Chipotle app and chipotle.com.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.840
Wait, can I guess?

38:59.840 --> 39:01.840
Guess what his go-to ever is?

39:01.840 --> 39:02.840
Sure, yeah.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.840
It's just an empty burrito

39:04.840 --> 39:06.840
that he later puts a cold hot dog in.

39:06.840 --> 39:07.840
Is that it?

39:07.840 --> 39:08.840
No, you're very close.

39:08.840 --> 39:09.840
Can I do a guess?

39:09.840 --> 39:12.840
Yeah, do a fun guess.

39:12.840 --> 39:13.840
It's a big burrito.

39:13.840 --> 39:16.840
He sticks four wheels on.

39:16.840 --> 39:17.840
They ride.

39:17.840 --> 39:19.840
Starting today, the first 2,000 fans.

39:19.840 --> 39:20.840
Wait, let Griffin finish.

39:20.840 --> 39:21.840
Let Griffin finish.

39:21.840 --> 39:22.840
What's he do, Griffin?

39:22.840 --> 39:24.840
He rides it like a skateboard.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.840
Starting today, the first 2,000 fans.

39:26.840 --> 39:27.840
And the wheels are tomatoes?

39:27.840 --> 39:28.840
No, they're wheels.

39:28.840 --> 39:29.840
Oh.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.840
I feel like I might be able to, if I act fast,

39:31.840 --> 39:34.840
I might be able to be among the first 2,000.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.840
And you guys are clearly doing your own thing.

39:36.840 --> 39:42.840
Someone just try to get this burrito real quick.

39:42.840 --> 39:46.840
The first 2,000 fans who order the Tony Hawk burrito

39:46.840 --> 39:49.840
made with brown rice, black beans, chicken, tomatillo,

39:49.840 --> 39:54.840
red chili salsa, pink trucks from a skateboard,

39:54.840 --> 39:59.840
and guacamole will get access to the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1

39:59.840 --> 40:05.840
and 2 warehouse demo for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, or PC.

40:05.840 --> 40:08.840
What a weird coincidence that this would, like,

40:08.840 --> 40:12.840
his brand super fanship would coincide with, like,

40:12.840 --> 40:15.840
a new Tony Hawk, like, video game experience.

40:15.840 --> 40:19.840
Yeah, it is very weird that, yeah, you're absolutely right, Travis.

40:19.840 --> 40:23.840
This is one of the stranger occurrences we've seen in our time.

40:23.840 --> 40:26.840
Those two have dovetailed magnificently together.

40:26.840 --> 40:31.840
Chipotle's, so I already said that, on August 14th at 11 a.m.,

40:31.840 --> 40:38.840
PT Anderson will direct a new motion picture strike, no, Pacific Time.

40:38.840 --> 40:41.840
The launch will culminate in a two-hour livestream

40:41.840 --> 40:45.840
from Chipotle's Twitch page that they have featuring Tony Hawk,

40:45.840 --> 40:50.840
fellow skateboarder Jagger Eaton, actor Finn Wolfhard.

40:50.840 --> 40:51.840
Fuck yeah!

40:51.840 --> 40:52.840
What?

40:52.840 --> 40:57.840
A sentient burrito, Mick Jagger, Jesus Christ of Nazareth,

40:57.840 --> 41:00.840
all eating burritos slowly.

41:00.840 --> 41:06.840
Still living Elvis Presley, now dead Elvis Costello.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.840
That's right, he'll be dead by August 14th, folks.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.840
No, it just says first three.

41:10.840 --> 41:16.840
They're going to be playing Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 and 2 warehouse demo,

41:16.840 --> 41:20.840
and they're going to be giving out up to 5,000 free burritos

41:20.840 --> 41:21.840
to viewers throughout the stream.

41:21.840 --> 41:25.840
Now, it says they're going to give out up to 5,000 free burritos.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.840
I do like the reality where they're like,

41:27.840 --> 41:29.840
we've given away 4,000 of these bad boys.

41:29.840 --> 41:32.840
The next thousand are coming home with us.

41:32.840 --> 41:33.840
Hi, it's me, Finn Wolfhard.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.840
Oh, no, not again.

41:35.840 --> 41:40.840
Yeah, anyway, I want 30 burritos delivered to my home,

41:40.840 --> 41:43.840
and the cost of that will be, oh, let me stop you right there.

41:43.840 --> 41:47.840
It's zero.

41:47.840 --> 41:51.840
This first-of-its-kind menu integration gives our fans a chance

41:51.840 --> 41:55.840
to eat like the greatest skater of all time

41:55.840 --> 41:57.840
and get access to the demo

41:57.840 --> 42:00.840
for one of the summer's most anticipated video game releases,

42:00.840 --> 42:02.840
says Chris Brant, Chief Marketing Officer.

42:02.840 --> 42:05.840
Real athletes need real food,

42:05.840 --> 42:09.840
and Chipotle is excited to continue being part of Sony's training routine,

42:09.840 --> 42:14.840
whether it's competing at the skate park or in a video game.

42:14.840 --> 42:17.840
Hey, this isn't the first time somebody has sold a food item

42:17.840 --> 42:21.840
because a celebrity liked it at their store, right?

42:21.840 --> 42:24.840
People have been doing that for, let me check,

42:24.840 --> 42:26.840
all of the time of restaurants.

42:26.840 --> 42:30.840
Yeah, but this one's Tony Hawk, and it's a burrito.

42:30.840 --> 42:34.840
I just want to step in here very briefly.

42:34.840 --> 42:40.840
I know that Tony Hawk's body,

42:40.840 --> 42:43.840
the body of Anthony Frank Hawk,

42:43.840 --> 42:48.840
the Birdman's body and my body have several chemical

42:48.840 --> 42:50.840
and physical differences.

42:50.840 --> 42:52.840
We can all agree on this, right?

42:52.840 --> 42:55.840
This is granted. This is settled law.

42:55.840 --> 42:57.840
The man is 52 years old,

42:57.840 --> 43:00.840
and if I were to make a list of things he felt like doing

43:00.840 --> 43:02.840
after pounding a burrito,

43:02.840 --> 43:06.840
I can almost guarantee you skateboarding

43:06.840 --> 43:09.840
would be extremely low on the list.

43:09.840 --> 43:12.840
Tony Hawk has been a Chipotle celebrity cardholder,

43:12.840 --> 43:14.840
whatever the fuck that means.

43:14.840 --> 43:16.840
It's an exclusive membership tier,

43:16.840 --> 43:18.840
afforded to famous friends of the brand

43:18.840 --> 43:22.840
that grants recipients free meals and catering since 2013.

43:22.840 --> 43:23.840
Holy shit.

43:23.840 --> 43:26.840
Did you guys hear this? Yeah, I'm hearing it now, baby.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.840
Are you hearing this? I'm hearing it now, baby.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.840
Tony Hawk has been a Chipotle celebrity cardholder,

43:30.840 --> 43:32.840
an exclusive membership tier,

43:32.840 --> 43:34.840
afforded to famous friends of the brand

43:34.840 --> 43:37.840
that grant recipients free meals and catering since 2013.

43:37.840 --> 43:39.840
Hey, Chipotle, I was just kidding.

43:39.840 --> 43:41.840
I love you. I love you.

43:41.840 --> 43:43.840
I take it all fucking back.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.840
I was just joking. You're great.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.840
I've always been a fan,

43:47.840 --> 43:50.840
and Justin Griffin have never loved you like I love you.

43:50.840 --> 43:52.840
Chipotle burritos are our favorite way to refuel

43:52.840 --> 43:55.840
after long skate sessions, adds me.

43:55.840 --> 43:57.840
No, it's Tony Hawk.

43:57.840 --> 44:01.840
It's a blast to see the enthusiasm for Chipotle,

44:01.840 --> 44:04.840
skating, and video games continue to grow

44:04.840 --> 44:08.840
and inspire a new generation of presumably burrito eaters.

44:08.840 --> 44:12.840
Whether you're a veteran THPS player or new to the game,

44:12.840 --> 44:17.840
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 TM has something for everyone.

44:17.840 --> 44:21.840
And also the burritos still.

44:21.840 --> 44:23.840
Still the burritos.

44:23.840 --> 44:28.840
Chipotle has amassed around 27,000 followers on Twitch.

44:28.840 --> 44:31.840
Like, finales for the Chipotle Challenger Series,

44:31.840 --> 44:33.840
the brand's marquee esports tournament

44:33.840 --> 44:35.840
that allows amateur gamers to compete against gaming stars

44:35.840 --> 44:39.840
and celebrities have been livestreamed on Chipotle's Twitch,

44:39.840 --> 44:41.840
along with exclusive musical performances.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.840
Aye, it's me, Mick Jagger.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.840
What an honor it is.

44:45.840 --> 44:50.840
What an honor it is to be playing on the Chipotle Twitch channel.

44:50.840 --> 44:52.840
Start me up.

44:52.840 --> 44:55.840
The first 2,000 account holders to order the Tony Hawk burrito

44:55.840 --> 44:58.840
on the Chipotle mobile app or at order.chipotle.com

44:58.840 --> 45:01.840
will receive a code to the email associated with the account,

45:01.840 --> 45:05.840
allowing the recipient to access a demo version of the relaunch

45:05.840 --> 45:09.840
of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater TM 1, TM, and 2 TM video game,

45:09.840 --> 45:11.840
ESRB rated T for team.

45:11.840 --> 45:12.840
Cool.

45:12.840 --> 45:15.840
I think they do a cuss in Superman by Goldfinger,

45:15.840 --> 45:18.840
so that's why it's not E for everyone.

45:18.840 --> 45:21.840
Here's the problem.

45:21.840 --> 45:23.840
I want to order this to get the code.

45:23.840 --> 45:24.840
I want to play the game.

45:24.840 --> 45:26.840
I don't want to go pick up a burrito.

45:26.840 --> 45:28.840
I'm recording a podcast,

45:28.840 --> 45:31.840
and I really don't want my wife to answer the door

45:31.840 --> 45:33.840
and a man in a mask says, here's Tony Hawk's burrito.

45:33.840 --> 45:34.840
Yeah.

45:34.840 --> 45:36.840
That's going to be hard for her to parse.

45:36.840 --> 45:39.840
Unless it is the Birdman himself.

45:39.840 --> 45:40.840
Or a Birdman.

45:40.840 --> 45:42.840
Or a Birdman's hand.

45:42.840 --> 45:46.840
Squid, enjoy your remastered skateboarding game.

45:46.840 --> 45:48.840
My wife is a big fan of Michael Keaton,

45:48.840 --> 45:50.840
so she might enjoy that actually.

45:50.840 --> 45:52.840
Just a joke.

45:52.840 --> 45:54.840
No, the movie had him in it.

45:54.840 --> 45:56.840
Yeah, it's just a fun...

45:56.840 --> 45:58.840
It's just a fun goof, the just ones do.

45:58.840 --> 45:59.840
Just a goof.

45:59.840 --> 46:02.840
I recently decided to shed my hoarder lifestyle

46:02.840 --> 46:04.840
and embrace a more minimalistic approach.

46:04.840 --> 46:05.840
It's been going well so far.

46:05.840 --> 46:07.840
I threw away all my hats.

46:07.840 --> 46:08.840
One problem though.

46:08.840 --> 46:10.840
What do I do with the yearbooks?

46:10.840 --> 46:12.840
I have one for each year, K through 12,

46:12.840 --> 46:13.840
and I never look at them.

46:13.840 --> 46:14.840
Donating seems weird,

46:14.840 --> 46:16.840
since it's such a weirdly personal item.

46:16.840 --> 46:18.840
My name is usually pinned with the inside cover messages

46:18.840 --> 46:20.840
from classmates, et cetera.

46:20.840 --> 46:22.840
But it also seems wrong to just throw them away.

46:22.840 --> 46:23.840
Am I doomed to carry them forever?

46:23.840 --> 46:25.840
That's from yearbook yeeter.

46:25.840 --> 46:28.840
I mean, you could keep them in your basement in Chicago,

46:28.840 --> 46:30.840
and then a fateful flood will take care of it for you

46:30.840 --> 46:31.840
like I did.

46:31.840 --> 46:33.840
That fateful flood, boy.

46:33.840 --> 46:37.840
I was traveling around with a huge cardboard box

46:37.840 --> 46:38.840
full of keepsakes,

46:38.840 --> 46:43.840
and then I had two paper Trader Joe's bags

46:43.840 --> 46:48.840
full of things like yearbooks and the like.

46:48.840 --> 46:50.840
And that great flood, ooh.

46:50.840 --> 46:54.840
The great flood of 2010 done took care of most of them for me.

46:54.840 --> 46:56.840
And it was rough for a while.

46:56.840 --> 46:58.840
I still get sad to think about the things that I lost in there.

46:58.840 --> 47:02.840
But whenever I move, wicked easy, wicked fast.

47:02.840 --> 47:07.840
So I think that yearbooks fall under the category of things

47:07.840 --> 47:10.840
that you keep because you convince yourself that someday

47:10.840 --> 47:14.840
someone else will want to know that thing about you.

47:14.840 --> 47:17.840
I think about this now with two kids that hypothetically

47:17.840 --> 47:19.840
someday my kids will be in high school, and they're like,

47:19.840 --> 47:21.840
I want to see daddy in high school.

47:21.840 --> 47:23.840
But let's be honest, that's not going to happen.

47:23.840 --> 47:26.840
I'm going to keep them long enough to show them to them,

47:26.840 --> 47:28.840
and then they're going to be like, okay, I don't care.

47:28.840 --> 47:32.840
We're all flying around in jetpacks and hover dogs now and shit.

47:32.840 --> 47:35.840
What do I give two shits about the fact that you were in some club

47:35.840 --> 47:37.840
in high school?

47:37.840 --> 47:41.840
And so now it's just like, well, now I've lugged this around forever.

47:41.840 --> 47:44.840
Hey, what if we, and I'm just going to throw this out,

47:44.840 --> 47:47.840
and I'm going to disrupt the whole yearbook industry.

47:47.840 --> 47:48.840
Well, careful, Travis.

47:48.840 --> 47:50.840
Are you thinking about what that would do?

47:50.840 --> 47:52.840
Digital yearbooks.

47:52.840 --> 47:54.840
Whoa.

47:54.840 --> 47:55.840
That's it.

47:55.840 --> 47:56.840
Okay.

47:56.840 --> 47:57.840
Wow.

47:57.840 --> 47:59.840
Yeah, I imagine they're already doing that.

47:59.840 --> 48:00.840
Probably.

48:00.840 --> 48:01.840
It seems like it's happening already.

48:01.840 --> 48:03.840
But if not, TM, TM, TM.

48:03.840 --> 48:05.840
Justin's got that cloud tech.

48:05.840 --> 48:08.840
That's on the next level.

48:08.840 --> 48:09.840
I actually don't have any cloud tech.

48:09.840 --> 48:10.840
I'm sorry.

48:10.840 --> 48:11.840
No, no, no, Justin.

48:11.840 --> 48:13.840
It's the Jostens.

48:13.840 --> 48:14.840
Yeah, I heard you.

48:14.840 --> 48:15.840
I just don't have any cloud tech.

48:15.840 --> 48:16.840
No, not Justin.

48:16.840 --> 48:19.840
It's Justin and Travis and Griffin.

48:19.840 --> 48:20.840
My brother.

48:20.840 --> 48:22.840
My brother and Mar.

48:22.840 --> 48:24.840
Oh, hi, Justin.

48:24.840 --> 48:29.840
Here, flood notwithstanding,

48:29.840 --> 48:35.840
I a couple times had to pare down my collection of keepsakes

48:35.840 --> 48:37.840
because I feel like there is a...

48:37.840 --> 48:43.840
I feel like actually the yearbook is one of the best sort of nostalgia

48:43.840 --> 48:48.840
per square inch that you can possibly keep around, right?

48:48.840 --> 48:52.840
If you're going to toss all your other keepsakes or whatever,

48:52.840 --> 48:58.840
I feel like the yearbook is literally a bunch of literal paper-thin

48:58.840 --> 49:00.840
old nostalgia drops.

49:00.840 --> 49:03.840
The few that survived that fateful flood,

49:03.840 --> 49:08.840
I have enjoyed looking back on every two years or so.

49:08.840 --> 49:14.840
Could you go through and just remove the pages

49:14.840 --> 49:16.840
that have nothing to do with you?

49:16.840 --> 49:17.840
That's great.

49:17.840 --> 49:18.840
I love that.

49:18.840 --> 49:21.840
And then combine all of them, all your yearbooks,

49:21.840 --> 49:26.840
into one long school book that includes all the years,

49:26.840 --> 49:29.840
but only the ones that pertain to you.

49:29.840 --> 49:33.840
If you're in 12th grade,

49:33.840 --> 49:35.840
do you care about the kids who are in 9th grade?

49:35.840 --> 49:36.840
No?

49:36.840 --> 49:38.840
No, you don't know them.

49:38.840 --> 49:39.840
Cut them out.

49:39.840 --> 49:41.840
You can go through all your photos and photo albums too

49:41.840 --> 49:48.840
and just tear apart the ones that you're not really a featured player in.

49:48.840 --> 49:51.840
And then go through all the books you own.

49:51.840 --> 49:55.840
And if the author wasn't nice enough to include you in that book,

49:55.840 --> 49:58.840
why would I read a book I'm not in?

49:58.840 --> 50:01.840
Maybe you go through your yearbook, you touch each kid's face,

50:01.840 --> 50:04.840
and you think, does this face spark joy in me?

50:04.840 --> 50:07.840
And if not, you burn it out with a cigarette.

50:07.840 --> 50:08.840
One by one.

50:08.840 --> 50:09.840
It's totally normal.

50:09.840 --> 50:13.840
It's just a totally cool thing to do that everyone does.

50:13.840 --> 50:16.840
And you mark their name off a big list.

50:16.840 --> 50:20.840
You don't burn each photo twice over the eyes.

50:20.840 --> 50:22.840
That would be fucking wild.

50:22.840 --> 50:26.840
One cigarette burn in the middle of the face, and then you move on.

50:26.840 --> 50:29.840
Now, you will want to try to make sure the kid behind that kid

50:29.840 --> 50:31.840
on the other page you also don't like.

50:31.840 --> 50:33.840
That is the one thing.

50:33.840 --> 50:34.840
Can I change the subject briefly?

50:34.840 --> 50:35.840
Okay.

50:35.840 --> 50:37.840
This is the shit that drives me crazy,

50:37.840 --> 50:41.840
is these brands put out these deals, and then they're like,

50:41.840 --> 50:44.840
if you actually try to do it, you can't.

50:44.840 --> 50:48.840
It's like they don't ever expect you to actually do the dumb thing

50:48.840 --> 50:50.840
they said to do, right?

50:50.840 --> 50:53.840
So I go to order.chibotle.com or whatever the fuck,

50:53.840 --> 50:56.840
and I'm like, let me get that Tony Hawk burrito.

50:56.840 --> 51:00.840
And it is not listed anywhere on the page.

51:00.840 --> 51:02.840
I know the ingredients of it.

51:02.840 --> 51:04.840
I'm wondering if it's like a code

51:04.840 --> 51:07.840
where I have to put in the right ingredients.

51:07.840 --> 51:08.840
You know what I mean?

51:08.840 --> 51:09.840
And then it'll just...

51:09.840 --> 51:11.840
Didn't you say that they announced it today,

51:11.840 --> 51:14.840
but the press release said August 14th?

51:14.840 --> 51:16.840
No, that's when it culminates with Finn Wolfhard

51:16.840 --> 51:18.840
playing Tony Hawk against Tony Hawk.

51:18.840 --> 51:21.840
Oh, right, right, right.

51:21.840 --> 51:22.840
I'm sorry.

51:22.840 --> 51:23.840
I'm going to try...

51:23.840 --> 51:26.840
If you guys are okay with this, we don't normally do this,

51:26.840 --> 51:28.840
but I'm going to try to call my local Chipotle.

51:28.840 --> 51:30.840
Okay, but don't put him on speaker.

51:30.840 --> 51:31.840
I'm not going to put him on speaker, Finn.

51:31.840 --> 51:32.840
I'm just going to call my local Chipotle.

51:32.840 --> 51:33.840
Okay.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.840
And you guys will just hear my part of it.

51:35.840 --> 51:36.840
Okay.

51:36.840 --> 51:37.840
So you won't hear them.

51:37.840 --> 51:38.840
Justin's really good on the phone.

51:38.840 --> 51:41.840
I wish I was as good as Justin on the phone.

51:41.840 --> 51:42.840
Please don't take me out.

51:42.840 --> 51:43.840
Okay.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.840
So strong and confident voice.

51:45.840 --> 51:49.840
There's a voicemail message.

51:49.840 --> 51:53.840
If you're calling about the Tony Hawk burrito, press nine.

51:53.840 --> 51:58.840
They're talking about the dining room precautions they've taken.

51:58.840 --> 51:59.840
That's good.

51:59.840 --> 52:00.840
I like that.

52:00.840 --> 52:03.840
Just can't help but eat inside Chipotle.

52:03.840 --> 52:04.840
Yes.

52:04.840 --> 52:08.840
Do you like extreme burrito experience?

52:08.840 --> 52:09.840
Yes.

52:09.840 --> 52:12.840
Do you like mostly fresh ingredients?

52:12.840 --> 52:16.840
Were you fucking in Stranger Thing?

52:16.840 --> 52:22.840
Do you think you could totally pwn Tony Hawk in his game?

52:22.840 --> 52:26.840
Hey, Tony Hawk is doing a Chipotle promotion

52:26.840 --> 52:28.840
where if you order a special Tony Hawk burrito,

52:28.840 --> 52:30.840
you get a demo of the game.

52:30.840 --> 52:31.840
They said you have to do it online

52:31.840 --> 52:32.840
after the first 2,000 people.

52:32.840 --> 52:34.840
So I feel like the clock's kind of ticking on me

52:34.840 --> 52:37.840
and I can't find a way to order the Tony Hawk burrito.

52:37.840 --> 52:39.840
Do you know anything about it

52:39.840 --> 52:45.840
or do I sound like an absolute lunatic to you right now?

52:45.840 --> 52:49.840
Yes, it's Justin.

52:49.840 --> 52:53.840
Hey, how's it going?

52:53.840 --> 52:56.840
I'm pretty good.

52:56.840 --> 52:57.840
Hold on.

52:57.840 --> 52:58.840
Okay.

52:58.840 --> 53:01.840
I'm recording our episode of My Brother, My Brother and Me right now.

53:01.840 --> 53:05.840
Can I put you on speaker real quick?

53:05.840 --> 53:06.840
Okay, great.

53:06.840 --> 53:08.840
Hold on one second.

53:08.840 --> 53:11.840
Okay, what was your name again, please?

53:11.840 --> 53:12.840
It's Haley.

53:12.840 --> 53:13.840
Haley.

53:13.840 --> 53:19.840
So have you heard about this Tony Hawk burrito?

53:19.840 --> 53:21.840
No, I haven't.

53:21.840 --> 53:23.840
Okay, I'm not making this up

53:23.840 --> 53:25.840
and you knew me from sound,

53:25.840 --> 53:28.840
so I'm imagining you know I'm not making it up too.

53:28.840 --> 53:30.840
No, not at all.

53:30.840 --> 53:32.840
Yeah, this is a thing that's happening,

53:32.840 --> 53:36.840
but corporate has not communicated to you

53:36.840 --> 53:39.840
that this is a thing that is going on, correct?

53:39.840 --> 53:41.840
No.

53:41.840 --> 53:45.840
Okay, so don't you think it's kind of shitty to be like –

53:45.840 --> 53:48.840
no, I'm not going to ask you to say something Chipotle is doing is shitty

53:48.840 --> 53:49.840
because that's your employer

53:49.840 --> 53:51.840
and I don't want to mess up your whole situation there.

53:51.840 --> 53:52.840
But –

53:52.840 --> 53:53.840
It's not shitty.

53:53.840 --> 53:54.840
What?

53:54.840 --> 53:55.840
I don't know.

53:55.840 --> 53:56.840
No, it's just really shitty.

53:56.840 --> 54:01.840
Haley, you don't have to take fucking swings at Chipotle

54:01.840 --> 54:04.840
for our benefit.

54:04.840 --> 54:05.840
It's awful.

54:05.840 --> 54:07.840
Okay, Haley, stop.

54:07.840 --> 54:08.840
Stop it.

54:08.840 --> 54:10.840
You're going to get yourself in trouble.

54:10.840 --> 54:16.840
I'm just saying that I just think it kind of stinks that Chipotle is doing this

54:16.840 --> 54:18.840
and I would like to –

54:18.840 --> 54:19.840
if you hear –

54:19.840 --> 54:21.840
and you definitely have not heard anything about a Tony Hawk burrito.

54:21.840 --> 54:23.840
Is that correct?

54:23.840 --> 54:24.840
Okay.

54:24.840 --> 54:29.840
Well, Chipotle, Haley, thank you so much.

54:29.840 --> 54:30.840
This is my brothers Travis and Griffin.

54:30.840 --> 54:31.840
They're on the line too.

54:31.840 --> 54:32.840
Hi.

54:32.840 --> 54:33.840
Hi.

54:33.840 --> 54:34.840
Sorry he just called you Chipotle Haley.

54:34.840 --> 54:35.840
Well, I mean, she's a –

54:35.840 --> 54:38.840
Haley, I'm sorry if I get you in trouble with Chipotle.

54:38.840 --> 54:42.840
We can offer you a position at the McElroy franchise

54:42.840 --> 54:45.840
if something like that happens or maybe we can try to buy that Chipotle.

54:45.840 --> 54:49.840
Oh, Haley, do you know anything about the VIP membership

54:49.840 --> 54:51.840
that you can get at Chipotle if you're a celebrity?

54:51.840 --> 54:56.840
Tony Hawk has it and I was just wondering if you had a form somewhere.

54:56.840 --> 54:58.840
I don't have it, but I can ask.

54:58.840 --> 54:59.840
Okay.

54:59.840 --> 55:00.840
That's okay.

55:00.840 --> 55:02.840
I don't want you to take up any more of your valuable time.

55:02.840 --> 55:03.840
Thank you so much, Haley.

55:03.840 --> 55:04.840
I appreciate it.

55:04.840 --> 55:05.840
Okay.

55:05.840 --> 55:06.840
I appreciate you.

55:06.840 --> 55:07.840
Have a great day.

55:07.840 --> 55:08.840
All right.

55:08.840 --> 55:09.840
Have fun.

55:09.840 --> 55:10.840
Bye.

55:10.840 --> 55:11.840
Bye.

55:11.840 --> 55:12.840
Okay.

55:12.840 --> 55:13.840
Clearly, Haley wasn't telling us everything.

55:13.840 --> 55:14.840
No.

55:14.840 --> 55:15.840
I mean –

55:15.840 --> 55:16.840
Yeah.

55:16.840 --> 55:17.840
Haley is definitely holding out.

55:17.840 --> 55:18.840
We're all –

55:18.840 --> 55:19.840
Yeah.

55:19.840 --> 55:20.840
I'm sorry, Haley.

55:20.840 --> 55:21.840
I hate to be the one last but clearly Haley knows more than they're telling us.

55:21.840 --> 55:24.840
I think Haley was busy either creating or eating

55:24.840 --> 55:27.840
or selling one of the last few Tony Hawk burritos

55:27.840 --> 55:31.840
and she also like definitely, definitely has gotten people into the VIP freebie club.

55:31.840 --> 55:32.840
Yeah.

55:32.840 --> 55:33.840
For sure.

55:33.840 --> 55:34.840
For sure.

55:34.840 --> 55:35.840
Yeah.

55:35.840 --> 55:36.840
For sure.

55:36.840 --> 55:37.840
For sure, for sure, for sure, for sure.

55:37.840 --> 55:38.840
But boy, we really can't do that anymore, huh?

55:38.840 --> 55:39.840
No.

55:39.840 --> 55:40.840
Especially you, Justin.

55:40.840 --> 55:41.840
I feel like you cannot call local places anymore.

55:41.840 --> 55:42.840
Oh, it's this guy.

55:42.840 --> 55:43.840
Yeah.

55:43.840 --> 55:44.840
It's this fucking –

55:44.840 --> 55:45.840
This guy.

55:45.840 --> 55:46.840
It's this fucking guy.

55:46.840 --> 55:47.840
This fucking guy.

55:47.840 --> 55:50.340
The fucking acapella guy warned me about you.

55:50.340 --> 55:53.840
You like to call fucking people on your podcast.

55:53.840 --> 55:54.840
Okay.

55:54.840 --> 55:55.840
Well, Haley –

55:55.840 --> 55:56.840
I feel like I could do it.

55:56.840 --> 56:00.840
My voice is just so bland and ordinary that it's hard to even pick it out.

56:00.840 --> 56:01.840
You know what I mean?

56:01.840 --> 56:02.840
Justin, are you doing okay?

56:02.840 --> 56:09.840
Because when she recognized who you were, I felt from, you know, however many thousand

56:09.840 --> 56:16.840
miles away from each other we are, like I felt your gonads go up in your body.

56:16.840 --> 56:17.840
Yeah.

56:17.840 --> 56:18.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:18.840 --> 56:20.840
As a sort of fight or flight response.

56:20.840 --> 56:21.840
It was not good.

56:21.840 --> 56:22.840
It didn't feel good.

56:22.840 --> 56:26.840
I felt like I was caught doing something wrong and I wasn't actually –

56:26.840 --> 56:27.840
And you were.

56:27.840 --> 56:28.840
You were.

56:28.840 --> 56:29.840
You were doing –

56:29.840 --> 56:31.840
I never knew if they heard about the Tony operator.

56:31.840 --> 56:32.840
Yeah.

56:32.840 --> 56:33.840
For sure.

56:33.840 --> 56:34.840
For sure, for sure.

56:34.840 --> 56:35.840
For sure, for sure, for sure.

56:35.840 --> 56:36.840
For sure.

56:36.840 --> 56:39.440
I forget what we were talking about, but I can't talk about anything else.

56:39.440 --> 56:41.440
I need to go lie down.

56:41.440 --> 56:43.900
Yeah, this is quite a thing.

56:43.900 --> 56:46.320
Thank you so much to everybody for listening to our podcast.

56:46.320 --> 56:47.320
We love you very much.

56:47.320 --> 56:48.320
Thank you to Haley.

56:48.320 --> 56:52.840
We'll be checking in with you periodically to make sure –

56:52.840 --> 56:58.040
Oh, and by the way, Chipotle, obviously, if anything happens to Haley as a result of

56:58.040 --> 57:00.240
her participation in this, we are coming for you.

57:00.240 --> 57:01.240
And you will not enjoy it.

57:01.240 --> 57:02.240
Oh, holy shit.

57:02.240 --> 57:03.240
This is not an idle threat.

57:03.240 --> 57:05.120
We have a certain set of skills.

57:05.120 --> 57:06.280
We have a certain set of skills.

57:06.280 --> 57:07.280
Hey, you know what?

57:07.280 --> 57:15.840
I can actually, in this exact situation, in this exact situation, I can say with a straight

57:15.840 --> 57:20.040
face that I do have a particular set of skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.

57:20.040 --> 57:24.360
If there's one thing the McElroy brothers are known for, it's weaponizing our audience

57:24.360 --> 57:29.240
to annoy big corporations into letting us do stuff.

57:29.240 --> 57:31.440
We've only used that power to create before.

57:31.440 --> 57:35.680
I'm kind of curious what it would feel like to destroy.

57:35.680 --> 57:43.120
Big news today, Chipotle was destroyed from the inside out by three weirdos.

57:43.120 --> 57:46.880
All right.

57:46.880 --> 57:49.940
Thanks again, by the way, for supporting us in the Max Fun Drive.

57:49.940 --> 57:55.280
It really is very kind of you, and we couldn't do this without you all.

57:55.280 --> 57:57.840
It's just very touching every year, honestly.

57:57.840 --> 58:02.560
I keep waiting for the year when it's zero and everybody wises up, but thank God it wasn't

58:02.560 --> 58:03.640
this year.

58:03.640 --> 58:04.640
There will come a point, right?

58:04.640 --> 58:08.720
Just law of averages, there will come a point when people are like, I think we've given

58:08.720 --> 58:09.720
enough.

58:09.720 --> 58:10.720
I think we've done enough.

58:10.720 --> 58:11.720
That's it.

58:11.720 --> 58:13.440
We're doing well here.

58:13.440 --> 58:17.400
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure.

58:17.400 --> 58:22.560
Off the album, putting the days to bed, been going long and strong with that jam and keeping

58:22.560 --> 58:24.520
that wax spinning all summer long.

58:24.520 --> 58:27.160
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us?

58:27.160 --> 58:28.160
I do, I do.

58:28.160 --> 58:32.360
Thank you to Max Fun, by the way, for having us on the network.

58:32.360 --> 58:34.160
A few people sent this in.

58:34.160 --> 58:35.160
Thank you.

58:35.160 --> 58:41.000
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user, who I'm going to call Kelly, asks, in all caps,

58:41.000 --> 58:46.840
with many exclamation points and question marks, does kissing your cat count as a first

58:46.840 --> 58:47.840
kiss?

58:47.840 --> 58:48.840
Oh, no.

58:48.840 --> 58:49.840
It was an accident.

58:49.840 --> 58:50.840
It was an accidental kiss.

58:50.840 --> 58:51.840
That's what the details say.

58:51.840 --> 58:54.840
I'm not going to read it.

58:54.840 --> 58:55.840
My name is Justin McElroy.

58:55.840 --> 58:56.840
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:56.840 --> 58:57.840
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:57.840 --> 58:58.840
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

58:58.840 --> 58:59.840
Kiss your dad.

58:59.840 --> 59:24.240
Square on the lips.
